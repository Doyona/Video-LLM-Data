1:00
Omg I didn't knew
1:08
1:30 😂 do not mess with donkey
How did I never hear about this
this reboot was the worst treatment futurama could have received.
Season 8 was dripping with woke. Fry goes phi-beta-cuck, they turned Bender into a preachy emotionally incontinent robitch and instead of poking fun at everyone, the show has become one big mean-spirited jab at Christians. Wokarama.
Why was it necessary to have covid in the show??
I missed this art style ❤
Futurama is still consistently better than the Simpson’s. You can feel the heart and OG writers coming back. While the Simpson’s has been dead for years
Can't wait
Man the series finale was the best out of any show out there. I don’t know if they can top it.
Because disentchantment didn't work .
Futurama​ โลกป่วนย้อนเวลาเกรียน
I'm waiting the new episodes
Out of Matt Groenings shows which one do you guys like the best The Simpsons Futurama or Disenchantment
best show of all time
Splendidly good news! I'm a year later tho...
Was a just ok show when I was a kid. Now, after shows like rick and morty... it just doesn't hold up. Sorry to have a different opinion, but try to not get angry.
Happy 25 anniversary
I miss this soo much
looking for a way to watch free site link please... if anyone knows one not paying 15$ a month.
FOREVER IN MY ❤
Gimme moreeee
There is something on the dark side of the moon ❤
Brothels should be allowed but the whole staff should be treated with respect
We got a lot of work to do together, especially with generating power. It won't be easy but I promise if we never stop working at it the future will be bright for us
Btw if you think asking me to ask them questions will work it won't, they only answer personal questions I have
It would probably be best if humankind kept this to themselves about the simulation because I'm pretty sure not all aliens will know
I'm serious about using sewage for power, we really do need to generate more power
That was a great finale, I love you all, everything still matters and that includes everyone you love
Just remember if this is our reality it's our reality, everything still matters ❤
It would be interesting to see visual proof
So we're in a simulation and they are in a simulation, probably goes endlessly lol
So I guess we can get power from sewer sewage lol disgusting but it would work
It's not Futurama.... the writing falls to emulate anything of older seasons
Years ago, Futurama was cancelled… and now, it returns, thanks to the developers and writers and the creator’s decisions. The wait… IS FINALLY OVER.
I'm going back in the freezer, Harley are still wanking well, see them next year.
I just watched the first episode and feel let down. The animation and acting were fine, but the jokes were superficial and pandering to be "relevant" by tying in with 2023 cultural buzzwords like an old geezer trying too hard to prove how hip he still is. The story was completely boring and extremely anticlimactic as a follow-up to "Meanwhile". There was so much shameful product placement. No original ideas were introduced, and beloved old minor characters were brought back for cheap and predictable laughs without substance that required no thinking to appreciate. I expect a lot more from Futurama. I'll give it another few chances and really do hope that the writers get back into the groove.
I like how Fry sounds less Fry and Farnsworth sounds more Farnsworth
This show is amazing crazy childhood memories
I love the Episode where Fri goes back in time and sees his dead mom, Made me run to my mom and dad and Give them the BIGGEST HUG!  the show hit all the sweet spots Comedy, Drama, Romance this show hits you right in the feels, just one of them classics you cant forget
Futurama has maintained an amazingly high level of quality after so many years, especially when compared to the Simpsons.
Cannot wait!!!!!!!
Please, all I ask of you is to NOT ruin this.
I love the animated Peggy Bundy 💜
I LOVE FUTURAMA. DON'T CANCEL IT, STUPIDS.
Reminder: Matt Groening and his Gross Feet were on Epstein Island.
poorer animation style than og episodes
FINALLY!!!! I really LOVE this show! Fox can bite my shiny metal a$$ 🤖
I Love Futurama
o my god. yes
Greatness returns
Futurama had the best final episode ever written for a show. I'm a huge fan but when I heard about new episodes I wonderdered why. Feels like adding some brush strokes to the Mona Lisa.
This can't be... hopefully the characters are still as nuanced as in the series before.
I Used To Watch This. I Want Season 12 To Air :)
Why does every show need to be topical now? I watch fiction to escape reality not to relive it
best show ever
And the great words of comic book guy “worst season ever”
Between many other program ive ever seen i had watched this like 7 times over and over and i cant get enough of it, no like the sampsons  kinda dragon ball i would repeatly see them and other shows the only ones had good job on are the parody of life like futurama , rick and morty or other like adult swins show, mostly i believe that show stick to a rule get bored like disney  doing censureship to many things while others show opposites to it and make it greatful for audience sadly futurama got canceled (wasnt actually was posponed) didnt gave a chance to bright due to fox didnt gave them exact time when the show was on early stages so sad
If M.G got ride of Lisa & Lella they wouldn’t lose so many fans. No one wants to listen to hypocrites with annoying voices.
my review of the season 8 so far: it's decent, still waiting for that "amazing" episode though
The new shows sux. They seem cardboard repeats. Disney sux
Needs more Snu-Snu!  "The spirit is willing but the flesh is spongy and bruised" never gets old. 🤣
I was just binging this with my partner and saw a new season was out! Can't believe it!!!!
Every episode has a quality seldom found in animation these days. Producers, animators, writers , voice actors All first class.
I like mom. She has a hard right hand. 😉
SO we are at the Re-Re-Revival?!
i cant believe i just found out FUTURAMA is BACK! My favorite series. Now what is Hulu and how can i watch it
s8 eP. 9  Is the worst excuse for a tv show ever... Can I sue you?  I want that 20 minutes of my life back !
👽🥰🤖🪐🌑🌙👍🏿🙌🏿👏🏿🙏🏿❤️🤗⭐🔥⭐🔥⭐🔥⭐🔥❤️🧡💖💛💚💙💜👍🏿👏🏿👍🏿👏🏿👍🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿
"Whoa,  sand warms .I hate them myself"
Sorry but most of the voice actors have been recast. With younger actors.
Finally about time this came out again.... Been long overdue!
С меня лярд лайков 😊
This season is mid just feel like ads, sponsors, n political real world issues ~ no creativity like the other seasons
we’re back baby.
Dear Hulu,I love you.
If the Simpsons can get 30+ season, why cannot we? When was the last time they actually did something good?
Episode 1 was quite clever, Episode 2 was heart warming.   The rest have been a mix of average & garbage tier. Particularly Episode 6 & 7 - I mean my god, they really are not funny in the slightest.   Really really disappointed. I never thought Futurama would go the same way as the Simpsons but here we are....
Just watched three episodes. It’s terrible 😅
It is aweful.
Funny
Something is off with the style and animations, felt very different to the old episodes which i watch daily since 1999.
I knew it wouldn't, couldn't, be as funny. You're generation is pure evil. I don't blame the people at Futurama. 😞
i legit cried seeing this, so many childhood memories... im happy this show is back, hope the next generating gets to make new memories as well
this is by the simpsons
MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!
Should have known hulu and the liberal bs would turn it into a pile of trash. All political, no humor. For the first time as a fan, cancel it for the last time and delete every episode of season 11 from history
Hope this is good.  Trailer makes it seem like it's gonna be another Disenchanted. I hope not. I hope for not shying away from laughing at Feminism, physics jokes and subtle double entendres requiring existing implied knowledge.
Can't wait for the inevitable Jurassic Bark reboot episode.
I will not relax hive, wait did you hear me? When I said
As some one who for the last 15+ years has had bender tattooed on his leg. Can we please just leave this show dead. Stop bringing it back. Please
Hooray! My most favorite cartoon of my childhood !
Good news everyone. My favorite ever is back, This show shouldn't stop 😢 I'm happy now ❤😀👍👍
john di maggio is booked
Hulu-rama is garbage tier television.
And just like that, the flame of hope has been reignited.   LONG LIVE ZOIDBERG!
A hilarious toon with a larger than life meaning.   Futurama, may you forevermore be in my future. 💙
Oh man, Futurama was and is awesome!
Why would u plaster Ur company name into the intro
The new episode came out on my 13th birthday, thank you hulu ❤❤
Bender !!! Yeahhh
I wish these talented creators moved on and made something new with these stellar voice actors. But this will still probably be better than new Simpsons, Nelson: Ha-Ha!
They build a new Futurama with black-jack and hookers
I thought Bender was in The Simpsons House in the 21st Century
Lol MOM slapping everybody
This actually broke my heart.  It's been a great series that just needed to be left alone.  Trying to "modernize" what was a futuristic show by adding garbage and awful writing isn't doing it a justice.
Goodbye Netflix hello hulu
Just watched episode 4... mostly the same, but I'm just not liking it as much... not sure why. Is it just me?
better than aven
I just found out about 2023 season. This really made my day. FUTURAMA for ever!
Good news everyone ! More Futurama !
it had the perfect end. Sad to see another reanimation (heh) of a complete show
I loved this show but it's supposed to be the future not now. It sucks now
Was this made using Adobe Flash?
was prettty happy to see them back,, but after watching 3 shows they should have stayed canceled
no fartin way
YES!!!! I'm about to start watching! I can't believe they brought it back!!! 😁😁
For a next episode Richard Nixon should be remplaced by a person more evil and insane than him: Donald Trump
Comment for algorithm god bless this show
The age of the voice actors does not detract from anything.
Have so far seen the three new episodes and I hate how they’re trying to tie in current events, like bro this is a futuristic show, they have a whole universe and plots available and it just seems lazy to me. I don’t know not liking the new season so far.
To me the new season has been trash
ok just to see futurama I would hire a streaming service. good that Hulu 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
the one show that keeps defying what cancelled means, bring on the new season
Epstein
not as funny as before
My advise is to do a better job of advertising what DAY OF THE WEEK new episodes are released. If it's every Monday, make sure we know clearly and often new Futurama episodes are every Monday.
So happy they’re back cause that Finale wasn’t it
Thank you Hulu! One of my All time favorite shows
Omg I can't wait !!!
Don't really think its going to be mind blowing, or change my life hilarious. But i might enjoy an episode from time to time :)
How many times has this show been rebooted? It's a genius way to keep going
i see  a pattern here old shows are coming intresting whats coming back next
If it's not on TV it doesn't count
I've watched the first episode and thought meh ok not as good as before but not awful either but after watching the second episode i wanted to break whoever wrote it legs in half
WHAT? But.. WHYY???  The end was absolutely P.E.R.F.E.C.T.   I really like the show and obviously want more of it because it has been great from start to finish, but again THE END WAS PERFECT !  It ends, and restarts in a time loop forever.. it makes sense, and it works !  WHY would you do this??? Even if they do a great job, it still ruins the whole ending we had at the time ! >< come on...
No :( it literally had the perfect ending…
Hallelujah!!!
Three seasons ago Futurama was in standard definition
Greatest animated show ever
Been a huge fan since Futuramas first pilot. But, with the "wokified" agenda being implemented in every aspect of "entertainment". Sadly now even affecting classics such as this. Myself along with millions of others, I hope. Will have to call it a hard pass. Even a small change, such as Billy West not voicing "Leo Wong", in the name of ignorance and pandering too the left ideology. Is a pathetic copout to the woke liberal agenda. Another animated favorite, fallen victim to the attention seeking liberals. Reruns and sweeps it is.
Finally!
i wish it was amazon prime :(
So guess what Disenchantment Part 5 is coming September 1 and it’s gonna be the final Part
That's the worst thing I've seen in a long time... And this was my favorite show ;(
I swear I thought this show was cancelled a decade and a half ago
The show has to be made available to people outside US.
I can't find it on HULU
Aaaaand it cancelled. Again.😂😂
He should find a way to go get his dog.
this is way too exciting
Literally I've grown up watching Futurama
When does the first episode of the new season hit Hulu
THEYRE BACK GUYS, WE ARE BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK!!!!! "Begins the Futurama ritual dance"
If I were Leela, Fry being a flattie is a deal breaker
The people from Fortnite
Ahhh. Its about time.
But why.... you already know that its never gonna be as good as the og...
looks fabulous!!! old memories!!!
First aqua teen now Futurama I feel like our childhood is coming back if these shows are back I wonder what next💯
I sure miss out.
Words cant describe how happy this makes me. I've been re-watching the old ones over the years with hopes they would come back again. FINALLY 🎉🎉🎉
Well, still better than Fox.
what,,,?????????? OMG😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
After a 10 long year of cancellation, they’re back. And this time, they’re on Hulu with an eighth season.
Ive watched the reboot and its still sharp comedy as usual... "  were back baby"
Everytime this show comes back it feels like it was just yesterday i watched one of the 3 finales, like the show never left, looks like there really bringing back stuff from the original run of episodes with Kif and amy's children, Fry's Parasites, Omicron Space battle, X-Mas heres hoping its just as good!
"We're back baby" from Di Maggio   ❤❤
Looking forward to it!
Who else came from Fortnite 😂😂😂
I LOVE FUTURAMA
THANK YOU GOD ❤
I just wanted to say to the writers, I loved every episode ever made. I hope that this new season will bring in younger fans because this show is ART!
Okay so first episode thoughts: actually really good. 8/10. Probanly would be higher if it wasn't for a cringey instantly dated joke about being "non-binary". Outside of that though, the episode was well written, packed full of humor and faithful af to it's source material. Let's hope they keep it up. (Please no more woke jokes though).
Futurama Is Back My Childhood Show!!!! 👏
Love the covid and crypto humor
Yes a legendary YES
I’ve only seen this bc of Fortnite 🤤
Now we need King of the Hill return the world 🌎 can be potential save or what's left of it that is 😅
To loosely quote Futurama, my thoughts on the first new episode is that my hopes were raised and dashed quite expertly.
i love you Hulu, shut up and take my money!
It's the guy from Fortnite
Futurama x Fortnite!
Bury it.
I've never watched futurama, someone convince me to watch it please
This is what GOTG think they are 😂
hulurama
Oh man I love this show.
Less self aware meta BS and more Futurama, or this is over before it begins.
Nah, got a chuckle or two out of it but the episode was completely ruined by the non stop meta jokes, yes you were canceled multiple times, no need to cram 5 or 6 jokes about it (if that) into 24 minutes...
これがフォトナとコラボするアニメか、、
Yes! I literally made a reference about bender this past weekend and bam a hole NEW season! I’m so excited about it!
The last season was weak (almost all the movies were great though), hopefully they can bring back the magic
Thanks for making life more enjoyable for well over 2 decades. Bender is great!
Its the guy from fortnite
Didn't hear Hermes speak.
I Loved Futurama it was My Favorite Show
Coronama  🦠 😷 💉
Good news everyone.
tell me is this season 8 or season 11.. im crying to know
Yesssss
canceled after the first episode... truly bland
The voices sound a little different across the board. Might be because everyone’s at least a decade older but there’s less dynamic range in their voices. Weird thing to complain about, I know, but after watching every season over 200 times I notice it. The voices don’t hit their higher notes as they used to. (Especially Lela) Also, it’s gonna take some getting used to having Fry and Lela fully accepting their relationship. I did used to hate Lela, because she spent the entire series leading Fry on while having cold feet over his maturity. So as a character I like this and find her more likable. But yeah, big change. We’ll see how it pans out.
We're back baby!
I laughed true joy when i heard Bender say "We're back baby! " in the first episode. This show keeps getting cancelled and coming back and im here for it!  My favorite show! 😂
I hate digital animation. It just looks half assed.
Gotta postpone my suicide.
We're Back Baby 💯
Just watched the first episode. Omg I’ve never seen a show come back so strong before this episode was perfect. On par with some of the best classic episodes. THIS is how you reboot a show
This Reboot is gonna change Futurama timeline forevere
Brooooo😭😭😭💯💯💯🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️thank you so much futurama!! This my favorite show, im obsessed, i watch it everyday !! This made me so happy mate
I haven’t been this hyped for a long time.
Awh I missed this music
Good news everyone!!!!
THANK YOU SO MUCH ❤❤❤❤ ❤❤❤❤❤
🤣yEEEEhAAAAw the universe just got better 😆
Do the Simpsons need to be canceled too so they reboot them as their old again?
Bender my fav robot is back baby😎😎😎😎😎
Good job paying your actors
I really hope it's good and so far it seems to be the same quality as the Comedy Central episodes, for better or worse.
Will we be able to buy this on dvd
I’m back also baby
We need this so bad with the state of the dialogue in tv and film at the min. I hope they keep going. All i could think about watching the enchanted thing was god i wish they would just do more Futurama.
BORING AS F FOR A FIRST EPISODE IN 10 YEARS NO ADVENTURES I RE SUBBED FOR THIS😏
Where can i watch this as a non american!?!?
This is amazing but somehow I everytime I see zoidberg the lobster it reminded of Nogla who plays as him
This is the only show where it’s on brand to be uncancelled so many years after😂 can’t eait
So cool they bring the show back 😁
AVENGED.
I cant wait its today
На этой планете стало веселей. Почему? Потому что выходит новый сезон футурамы!!!
It doesn't die, it regenerates! The ending on Comedy Central was perfect, but I'm still glad they're bringing it back.
YYYYEEEEEAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH is it on yet? I'm looking on hulu.
Second time, they got uncanceled
MMMMMM.... Oh man.... Im nervous.... I want this to be quality. But... Werrrre the voices sounding right to everyone? Zoidburg sounds different.... And fry right at the end sounded a little different as well. Like obviously theres differences between reboots but.... Ah maybe im just anxious hahaha
This is better than family guys
I'll never understand how family guy caught on and thus masterpiece was canceled! Can't wait to watch this tomorrow
Benders voice is terrible. They need to make his voice slightly deeper.
Hearing and seeing this is like being rewarded with a gift
It's about time Futurama is back baby and I'm delighted ☺️ 😊
They’re back baby!
This is going to be another garbage reboot filled with forced jokes that would've came naturally in the original run. Low expectations.
Please, please, please, PLEASE dont be woke. I dont have my hopes up, but still.
The trailer looks really good. With that being said; this will most certainly be awful. The writing will be woke, political propaganda. Guaranteed to be filled with what the majority does not want in a comedy show that should be for pure entertainment value. The simpsons got ruined by the same as the seasons progressed. Get woke, go broke.
Wow. Three brutal jokes in one trailer. Humor used to come easy to them if it's forced this will be garbage
My childhood is returning tomorrow 😁
Love this show idk about hulu taking it over though they're super biased the show won't be the same
We watch Futurama every night an this is all we could ask for!!!
Yay! My comfort show is coming back tomorrow! 🙌
LOVE Futurama & i STILL do. Its 1 of my favorite Sci-Fi shows together with Star Trek, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Thunderbirds, Doctor Who, Mandalorian, The Orville & Buzz Lightyear of Star Command. And Futurama is BETTER than The Simpsons.
I just can't wait to watch it in Italy, always loved Futurama 💗
Oh, they’re doing current event stuff again…That’s the kind of writing that ruined this show
I love that they can't keep Futurama down permanently, this show has come back hundreds of times.
I am excited but can't lie even judging by the trailer the characters don't feel organic, more like they were forced to make a sketch or something...
The trailer wasn't funny. Back to ruin it's reputation for cash.
Sweet tornados of Barbados!
first episode is out tomorrow!!!!! I literally cant wait!!!!
ngl Leelas bracelet looks outdated even by 2020s standards
I wonder who they will make homosexual?😂
The Crew!!!!
Who's idea was it to air a new episode on a Monday?
"You could almost say we're on a more Hulu-central platform"
Not only am I excited; I'm even more than excited.
Are you excited everyone that the new season on Futurama that is going to be so great😄😋😉
❤❤❤❤ my favorite show!!  I wonder if they’ll explain or just skip over the ending and continue on lol 😂😂
This is going to be fun
please don't
COVID test, crypto, and manscaping jokes...idk if they wrote the script in 2020 and never updated anything, but this looks like a trainwreck
Hulu executive secures Futurama... your job is safe. rest of movie and tv show have to go...... wow. hollywood is on strike.
Fine I'll sub to Hulu 😂
Yeeeeeeeeeees
What?
Good news everyone !
AS SOON as I heard Bender yell "WE'RE BACK, BABY!!!" it was like a relative I haven't seen in years level of excitement.
I really hope this won’t ruin the shows great run
This show was a major thing in my childhood. I’m so happy they brought it back because it’s honestly the most underrated adult show.
Finally
If the Simpsons aren't canceled than why would Futurama be?
The show that will never die because the fan base just adores it that much. im actually in shock they brought it back AGAIN. Long live futurama!
Cant wait!
W for HULU
O Hypeee tá lá em cimaaaaaaaaaaa, mal posso espera pela Dub PT BR 😍😍😍
So many pop culture and political references LOL
It has been avenged!
LETS GOOOOOO
They’re bringing back the show
old school is back!!! love it!!
Futurama is like the Phoenix of TV
shut up and take my money
Please don't ruin it please don't ruin it please don't ruin it
This is my favorite show when growing up. Thank you so much for bringing it back. I waited nearly 10 years for this to come back
let's see if Hulu has learned from Disney's mistakes and didn't go woke... :D
It's almost time!
What!!! I can't believe it 😭
I am beyond happy the show is coming back i was so scared one of the cast members would pass away and that would be the end of hoping for a revival.....frank welker was the voice of fred in the original 1969 scooby doo cartoon he is up there but hey it happened only about 100 hours to go yeeeeesssssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
💥
How they going to continue it with that last ending?
Good news everyone leak information new season in April 2024 ...😊
I'm so happy right now! I still remember being totally flashed by the epic sounding theme tune and CGI ship (which I have as a figure) in the intro in 1999 when I was 14. I was sad when it first got cancelled and then again the second time, though the second one at least had some closure to it. I hope it sticks around a while longer this time, imho it deserves it way more than the Simpsons. I used to love the Simpsons, but I stopped watching it quite some years ago for good reason.
Rising from the dead like calculon… dramatic pause 🫴
Yesssss
Yo, ai generated voices?
too bad stuff like this can't happen with more shows
OMGGG IT FEELS THE SAMEEE
Yooooooooo!!!! I can’t wait!!! This has always been my favorite show😢 so happy it’s finally back.
I'm surprised it's the same voice actors
4 more days
Futurama had the perfect ending…,why would you revive it.
Can’t wait 😮
the only show i can think of that can fade out of existence for a decade and come back like nothing happened
Please 5 more seasons 🎉😮
This is exciting 🎉
Não esqueçam do Brasil 🥺❤️🇧🇷
I always knew that someday futurama is going to return so I patiently waited until the day finally came.
1:09
This is my comfort show, and I’m excited for this☺️ this looks really fun
We back baby! Again😂 again😂
Hope they didn't woke this up. Also glad to see fry and leela are still together
I listened thinking "wow, they got a really good sound-alike for Bender" , only to then web search & find that JDM is coming back after all, lol (woo!).
Let's go already
LEETTSSSS GOOOOOOOOOO
I ain't ever gonna stop loving futurama
I don’t have Hulu in Canada, so where can I watch it?
So ready for this I could watch this show over and over such an enjoyable watch
About time.
I knew this was going to be soulless, but wow.
They were cancelled before and came back in season six so you know season elevens gonna talk about the cancelation
I didn’t know it got canceled but I’m glad there bringing it back, my favorite animated adult show.
In the immortal words of Bender B. Rodriguez "WERE BACK BABY!!!!"
After this ends do you really think it ended lol no...
thats kinda likee fortnite
Anyone else remember this gem as a child on comedy central?
Futurama hasn’t missed once yet, I can’t imagine they mess up now; the show is monumental, they know better than to cash grab
GOOD NEWS EVERYONE
This show ended well, it was good when we had it now we need to move on
Are we not gonna talk about how this season looks the exact same and sounds the exact same as previous seasons? It’s really refreshing, as if it wasn’t even canceled
This has been my "go to sleep"/"want to watch something but don't" show for many years. This is amazing but the voices and sound are just not right?
Dose this erase the ending zoidberg better still be with that girl otherwise ima struggle watching and I've watched the show like 15 times
I still watch this show everynight while I try to go to sleep 😂
How come fox didn't buy them out?
This is amazing, let’s fking gooooooo
I've never been happier
Ive never been so happy
Haha I had feeling this was going to happen I’m so happy to see this 🥲😃
I love this show so happy to see it back
I hope to God this time this show lasts more than a few seasons!
Thank you Hulu❤️
OH MY FKING GOOOOOOODDDDD!!!!! THIS WAS MY FAVORITE SHOW WHEN I WAS A KID AÀAAAAAAAAAAAH
0:01 this could be the opening to the show
It's kinda weird seeing current culture referenced in the show like this
Can’t wait to watch this with 50 ad breaks in between! Hulu is garbage
this show is on same level as family guy , the Simpsons and south park I will never understand how it got cancelled in first place but so happy it back
it looks not very fun . my opinion.
I love the part when bender says it's futuraming time and futurates all over the places.
I'm really conflicted about this return. I love Futurama, it's one of my favorites. But, Meanwhile was not only a perfect way to end the series. It was one of the best series finale ever. So having it return ten years later just doesn't sit right with me.
I'm going back and rewatching all the old episodes... After watching Zapp's first intro to the show again, all I want to see now is an entire episode about Zapp with a clone of himself... I have a Nimbus full of ideas in my mind about how that episode would play out, and each and every one is pure entertainment.
I don’t believe my eyes
❤❤❤
I can't wait for this, I've waited 10 years!
10 years ago I saw the last episode live. That was the only episode I saw live as I was very late to the series. I hope this new season doesn’t ruin the series for me. I know the series has been canceled and renewed multiple times it’s just that this show means a lot to me and for 10 years I thought it was over. The ending we had 10 years ago felt right. I hope that there is heart put into this new season.
I really hope they got the original writers for this. I’ve seen other old shows come back with new writers and they completely miss the mark.
With the resurgence and ruining of shows like Clone high this actually looks like they can keep the charm of the original, can’t wait
This show needs to end already
I’m so excited!  I’ve been addicted since the series premiere in 1999!!!
Life's worth living agin 😂
Yessssssssssssssss!
it seems a bit off tbh but i loved this show so much, i will give it a try.
Gumbercules? I LOVE that guy!
Good news everyone! We’re back on air!
this is probably the only thing I’ve wanted ever
Надеюсь, его не испортят тонной политкорректности и прочим блм
Honestly the announcements didn't feel real until I saw this. I'm so excited for Futurama to come back!
reminder that fry is still trying to smash  leela after 23 years
LONG LIVE FUTURAMA!!!!!
This show is too intelligent for studio execs. It may have low brow humor but also throws in gags that are deeply scientific.   Studio execs are too busy sexually assaulting women and children to be smart enough for this show
Looks like Mom is in charge now. A woman who makes Mr Burns look like a saint.
Good news everyone. We are being revived for corporate gains!
I can't wait I have watched this show since I was 3 years old and this is just incredible and I am surprised that benders voice sounds the same
Вот это хорошие новости!!!👍👍👍👍
The animations feel a bit choppy...
Please just keep the quality of the original show, this looks amazing
I hope they don't ruin the last episode the Comedy Central made. I hope they explore one time characters that were seen in previous episodes.
Bender v.2😮
this looks perfect cant wait to see it again
so excited can't wait
Espero que sea una digna sucesora
When streaming services take over shows it's usually ruined
My favorite
I’ve always liked the continuity side of Futurama, things that happen in one episode are referenced or pay off seasons down the line, it’s clever & rewarded the viewers for paying attention
please dont ruin what we all know and love.
Will the head of Trump replace the head of Nixon?
Honestly nothing in this trailer feels any different or worse than the later/Comedy Central Seasons of the show. So I find it weird how many people who seem to be fans of those seasons got so upset from anything here.  All I can say is hope it's good, hope if we get a new ending to the show it feels more satisfying than the last one. I know some people really loved that previous ending, I liked it too but I had a few gripes with it.
The eye phone
Loved this ❤
At last....
It looks bad
This show came out my freshman year of high school 😁now I'm close to 40🤣🤣
👍
Can’t wait!
❤❤❤❤❤❤ yes its back. So glad its still came back.  I hope futurama stays alive this time.  It keeps getting cancelled. The trailer looks awesome too can't wait.
So excited
W
Great
I hope they don't ruin it with today's politics
WE ARE GONNA HAVE NEW BENDER SOUND BITES OMG
I CAN'T WAIT! I could probably recite every episode to date. I keep this show in heavy rotation so It's an understatement when I say I'm excited to see the return of Futurama. Season 6 was the best season ever. Let's hope they can 1-up it!
It'll be modernized. Woke writing and snowflake crewmembers
Where can I find all chapters?
I love that the show
Why. It ended in such a perfect way. This just undoes a perfect show ending for a season nobody asked for and nobody wanted.
The show full 🌝 super
Let's gooo!
I hope they'll do season 9, 10 and beyond.
I'm laughing already! 🤣🥰
Yay, Futurama is back! 😘😍🥰
Somebody want to tell Disney+ to list the original episodes in the correct order and aspect ratios?
Oh this is gonna be good
Finally after a decade of wondering and waiting if Futurama will continue with its spectacular characters and hilarious humor 🎉😂, well, now  it has returned and goodness gracious great balls of fire, I am glad. My favorite animated show beside The Simpsons. I also love Family Guy but I prefer  Futurama over Family Guy. But it is worth the time. Thank you very much Mr. M.G. much much  respect to you Sir.
😢it’s back
I love how they have included references to Covid and Alexa 😂
I think they're going to reboot the show by using the timeline where Farnsworth was using the forward time machine and blah blah blah I'm too tired to explain the rest
I loved watching this shows as a kid's
Futurama is back???? that’s awesome!
So unbelievably exciteddddddd🔥
I have a sneaking suspicion that, they are gonna ruin it somehow, it had a perfect ending. and that Corona virus thing is just a declaration of lacking ideas.
😃so happy!!!!!😁
Amazing
Underrated.
Soon Everyone in New new York will stop reacting to the virus like we did.
I love it
How am I just now finding out about this?
I love Futurama, but I do want a proper ending to it and not let it be another endless simpsons show, I kinda want a ending with Fry maybe going back to the past and saying goodbye to it 1 final time and also let other chracters have proper endings too and maybe Fry meets "God" from the godfellas episode and has a chat or smt
Best adult cartoon show ever
“That sounds like fun on the bun” but seriously I’m so excited
For those who don't know, I am the man with no name...
yay. i have always loved futurama way more than how the simpsons have been on for so long.
👍👍👍👍
Please make this true I’ll buy Hulu or whatever company comes next just KEEP IT ALIVE
😊
back again hopefully it's better than the last few seasons
I love this show wit everything in my heart. 🤙
“It just won’t stay dead.” I’m so hyped for this revival yet again. I only wish it could have kept going throughout all these years it’s been gone.
Who’s hyped for the return of futurama
3 more weeks to go, at least 2 for the least xD
How on earth will I watch it in the UK
Does the audio seem kind of weird to anyone else? It is as if they made the trailer, then slowed it down by like 10%. Everyone's voice, even the music and special effects seems a little... slow and stretched out with a lower pitch. Regardless, I can't wait! Looking forward to seeing some friendly faces again. And Zoidberg.
Please don't woke this up.
OMG OMG OMG
Can’t believe they didn’t start with  zapp Brannigan to inform the men
My favorite show as a kid is back and it really doesn't feel like it's been years, it feels the same as it always did im so excited for this to happen
this looks so funny like it never left
nice video
I’m back baby
started watching it with me when she was 3 years old and ever since, she has never got tired of it. She is now 18-years
Pllleeeaaassseee keep this going
“ manscape me Kiff … THATS AN ORDER “ - zap Brannigan
Just A few more days
Simple the best!! O love it
Too bad Hulu had all that drag stuff last month. Cancelled it soon as I saw ads for it everywhere.
Muy buen video. Me encanta este video. Estos dibujos son mis favoritos!!!
thanks god they bring it back! pls dont ever close it again
The covid and crypto jokes feel a couple of years out of date already
Ну наконец-то!
It’s like nothing changed. The feeling of it is still there. Like they still have been doing this for the last decade. That’s crazy, awesome though too! Can’t wait!
I can't believe how many seasons of Futurama we were rob of. This time no canceling, please.
My only concern is all the modern references that they are throwing in that will likely be super dated in a few years.
the true neverending story
LET'S GOOOO ALREADYYYYY!!!!
YAY SO EXCITED!! :)
Yes!! Finally
Ждем
Bite my shiny metal ###
The show that won't die! Let's goooooooo!
Is that 11 M views in 9 days??? LOL The demand has spoken!
Really love that moment when Fry said "It's Futurama time" and Futurama'ed all over the place.
please dont end love this series
Lol
It just won't die 😂
The show will have a massive response, hoping it'll be a 16 episode season and we'll get more seasons soon after.
Were back baby yeah that’s my boy 😊
I’m so glad it’s finally coming back!!! One of my favorite shows ever, I rewatch it every time I’m feeling down and it always makes me feel better
Dreams come true.
Please. Do. Not. Break. Up. Fry. And. Leala   Let them be happy and in love. It was my favorite part of the last season
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Hulu..................is owned by  DISNEY!!!!!!!!  >>>>>>>>>>>>>*Canceled immediately when I found this out!!*
so no way to watch it in the uk?
This makes me so happy - the immortal Futurama is back.
Ok I'm hyped but given how the show ended...they better keep Leela and Fry together through the whole show this time...no will they, won't they anymore. We've already BEEN through that.
Oh. Your. God!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Futurama again! :D
Finally, after ten long years Futurama is back baby I am excited
At 22 seconds there's an explosion, if timed just right, you can pause and see what's going on. It takes place in the Planet Express break room, we see most of the usual main cast, but we also see 2 barrels of slurm, and what looks like "The Human" from All My Circuits. Also the 2 barrels of slurm seem to be connected to whatever is exploding.
OK after a second viewing of the trailer I feel pretty confident in it coming back!!😂
This is my favorite animated show of all time, I really hope the jokes hit. The trailer has some really funny moments, please please bring the laughs!
Sry...it's just not the same, mind as well do something new. The original show ended in a high note, i don't see this doing anything good with it. The trailer didn't help, the jokes feel water down, mind as well go for a nock nock joke. sad
"We're back baby" The immortal words of Futurama
From the trailer, there seems to be many futurama aspects ... Sure hope it doesnt become woke trash, leela hitting the guard at the start seemed a bit un leela like and more of a dumb feminist getting offended type but I sure hope its just my imagination and the writers are the same or atleast someone of the old writers is in charge. I know that Matt Groening is not in charge anymore
Yep. Need a subscription. Thought you might give me a reason to watch network x again... Bahaha
If you mofos make this show woke... Then there is nothing left that you havent destroyed.
What's next, a second season of Firefly?!
Nice
I'm so happy. I can't wait.
Futurama had a great ending, i have my doubts if reviving it is a good idea, especially with different writers. We'll just have to see.
I'm glad Futurama is getting another revival, a running theme I hope they break the 4th wall with in the first episode as they've done before... several times.  The episode I'm most looking forward to is "Parasites Regained", the original "Parasites Lost" didn't make my top 10, not because I didn't like it, it just didn't really stand out to my tastes, but this sequel episode seems really intriguing.  For one thing, it seems they don't use the virtual reality helmets to control microscopic versions of themselves, it seems like they actually get shrunk for this one. And usually Zoidberg is a secondary character who is left out of the main action unless the whole crew is featured in the episode, or if it's a Zoidberg centred episode. So I'm hoping he plays an important role, because it would be such a disappointment if he was just "there for the ride".  However it could be that this is another one of Farnsworth's prototype inventions that he hasn't been able to test, so he tests it on Zoidberg to see if it works (The Inhuman Torch) and as he's the first one shrunk, he just joins Fry, Leela, and Bender on their mission because "why not?".  But as the Tank seems to be in the process of shrinking while all 4 of them are in it, maybe Zoidberg was just "living" in the Tank (Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch) and is now accidentally part of the mission.  Also Nibbler has replaced the role of Fry in stopping the crew from defeating the worms, so I wonder how that will pan out. What are the worms helping Nibbler do? Are the worms manipulating Nibbler? Is Nibbler manipulating the worms? Is Nibbler protecting the worms?  So many questions... So many possibilities.
Поцелуй мой блестящий зад, это свершилось !
Jesus Christ Saves  Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.  Jesus Christ died on a cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later, to pay for the sins of mankind, to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.  EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:  1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord.  2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.  Biblical References: 1. Romans 5:9 2. Romans 3:23 3. Romans 6:23 4. Romans 10:9 5. Romans 10:13 6. Ephesians 2: 8 & 9 7. John 3:16  God bless you, peace be with you always. Thank you for your time.
Awesome,  love the show and can't wait!  Way funnier than the Simpsons!
excited for this!
finally!! lets gooooo hulu! good thing yall put it back. its one of the best shows there was 💯
After 10 years the show is returning.
This looks kinda fun! I can’t wait to watch it hundreds of times!
YEEEEEE BABY, IM SO HAPPY 😱🙃🤣
Hail to the mighty cockroach of the cartoon industry
good
❤❤❤
YEEEEEEESSSSSS!
They already had a great series finale and 7 solid seasons of comedy. Why risk all of that when almost no reboot matches the success of the original? I would think that the creators were above this but maybe the company wanted to cash in on futurama fans because I'm cool just watching the original series. I don't need a new season and will not be watching the new episodes. I didn't even watch this video. I just came here to comment how much I dislike them rebooting the series
This makes me so happy.
Like Zombie Jesus it keeps coming back!
They should have just kept Futurama and cancelled the Simpsons in 2013.
Futurama because you can't cancel the future!
I still can't believe this is real
i hope the new final episode is amazing
planet express is back!
I thought this show ended after Fry messed with a time machine that goes eight seconds back into the past and Lela tried to save him from certain death.
SO EXCITED! Hulu can I watch the episodes early and review them? I’ve literally seen Futurama more than ANYONE(it’s on in my room nearly 24/7)
it just cannot stay dead! Welcome back Futurama! I knew deep deep in my hart you will be back sooner or later! Loved the show from very first episode to the very last one you will make in many many years ahead! Stai alive forever!!!
Does the animation seem weaker to anyone else?? Hopefully the writing isn’t.
I'm so skipping the COVID episode
All those series rewatches made this happen. Let's go!
While I'm happy, it's back, I worry that bringing this show back from the dead so many times could have side effects ha ha
I LOVE YOU FUTURAMA! 🤩NEW SEASON!😍
It's coming back?....again?
This show was my childhood. I must have Binge watched it at least 30 times now. I can't wait
Never let it die! 🙏🏼❤
good ilike nicw
Yes can’t wait
I’m curious on who’s going to be heads in jars this season.
Let's go already !!!
Good News Everyone.
It survives a second time whoooooooo
At least this show won’t end in a time loop! Maybe Fry and Leela will get married without being frozen in time this time!!!
Not going to get my hopes up that it hasn’t been bastardised for ‘modern audiences’
Yessssss, never stop making episodes. Take my money.
shut up and take my currency
it’s probably gonna get canceled again and get revived again, maybe by disney or smth
❤
if this new season of my childhood ois woke i might actually become homicidal
This was my favorite tv cartoon when I was a kid, I still love it
Please don't ruin it, please don't ruin it, please don't ruin it, please don't ruin it, please don't ruin it, PLEASE don't ruin that perfect ending. 🙏🤞
Futurama doing Covid jokes, right on time
Wow it looks like Matt Groening is not quitting on this show. I enjoyed it well enough as a kid and as a young adult but I want this show to be in a new direction and hints of it are seen here in this trailer. 🙂
They didn't need to bring this back.  I love Futurama, but it overstayed its welcome the last time it came back. And the jokes in that period were too tied into what was going on when the episodes came out. Looks like they're going that way with this season, too. A show set a thousand years in the future shouldn't feel dated.
Honestly they couldn’t have ended it better but i’m happy for more lol
Im so excited
After 10 years
“We Love you Bender!” “Shut up baby, I know it!!”
Bender bending Rodriguez
Honestly..... Considering a Hulu subscription now.
Is this a world record for cancellations of a show then also bringing it back?
A million years and reboots and it remains the same as always. I LOVE IT
After all these years my favorite show finally came back on air ❤
Of course they brought covid into it
11m views I am so happy
❤❤❤
Just let it rest in peace already
My co-worker and I are excited about this show.
I wonder if Bender can say his catchphrase again.
NO WAY
I’ve loved this show since my childhood now that I’m an adult I’m more excited then ever for the show to be back 💯💯💯
This show hasn't changed the art style from 2013
"Sorry guys I suffer from Noassatall.
The PG rick and morty
Looks like they are keeping it like they use to can’t wait to watch already been binge watching the show on Hulu currently
This show is hide to all.
I can’t believe Billy west is 71 and he voices fry
디플 뭐하냐!!!!!!저거 들여야지!!!
nice
Ughhhhh this is either going ot be great or terrible and based on this trailer I'm getting slight terrible vibes.
Futurama is one of my favorites shows. I really hope the reboot continues the same humor and vibe the original series had.
This show was my childhood. Discovered it by accident and was addicted from E1, so excited for it's comeback 🥳
I can't wait!
Nice
🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺
aaaaaaaaaa
Now they decide to bring it back. So they can make it woke
Hulu trying to get me to renew my subscription. I still love this show!
But why? Futuramas finale was a phenomenal ending to a beloved series. Do we really need it back? I can also already tell Bender is going to be neutered.
wow, i'm emotional about this
Great to see they’re keeping Fry and Leeta together as opposed to breaking them up so we can get another tortured and painfully unnecessary “Will They or Won’t They” get back together storyline.
From the creators of Futurama
Plot twist. All these clips are from the first epiosde🤣
YES!
Yeeeeessssss🥳
It's coming out on my birthday
Ееееееееееее
omg no yet another show being rebooted because execs can't come up with an original idea to save their lives. Futurama had an amazing ending that tied everything together, now they want to undo that just to make more money! Leave futurama alone!
Nothing better
I've got a really bad feeling about this
I'm in New Jersey and still looking for a decent place to live
This is a show I don't mind coming back every 10 years.
Futurama 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Прикольний мульт! Чекаємо на продовження.
Futurama is a show that will never run out of ideas.  On a side note make a full episode of “G.I. Zapps.”
Yeahhh!
Love Futurama, but really worried about what kind of garbage they gonna bring back.
Fry's voice still sounds good considering his voice actor is 71 years old!
I could not have been more surprised today
the only voices that haven't changed since the cc seasons are Amy, Bender, And Scruffy
But i already became old and got children 😢 who cares 😂
The show might actually be good this time.
GOOD NEWS EVERYONE!
I'm happy this series is back, and yet I'm scared what the season is gonna be like (those)
Finaly Futurama Is going back
I hope we get a few seasons, maybe 4-5 would be perfect and get a good ending. It shouldn't last forever like The Simpsons, just a little while longer.
About time.
Zapp BRANNIGAAAAAN😎😎
W
Futurerama is back I loved watching the show I can’t wait to watch the new season 🎉🎉🎉
This should be an easy win for Disney. I hope they don't ruin it like everything else they out out.
Like the neutral from the neutral planet I can only say I will see if I like it
We're freaking back baby!!!!
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
I can’t wait for this I love Futurama
So they're going to eat the fan favorite dog just for laughs and shock value?
I was so hoping that covid was not going to be even hinted at but that's out the window
Pleeeeaaasssseeee be good without heavy political commentary
🥲🥲 i soo happy
DEATH BY SNU SNU!
Never should’ve been canceled in the first place! Welcome back Futurama 🎊 🎊
OMGGGG YESSSSS
My wife and I binge watched all the seasons to get ready for this! Quite possibly our favorite show ever, we're so excited!!! Thank you @Hulu for bringing it back!
Please please bring the little Seymour dog back so he can be with Fry!
WELCOME BACK FUTURAMA!!!
AFTER 13 YEARS!!!!!! LETS GO!!!!
I hate hulu. I don't get commercials with anyone else but them and I don't want commercials.,
Why? Futurama had the perfect ending.
Finally some references I can relate to
I am so excited for this!
I can’t wait for Futuramas fifth finale. It’ll be the best one yet!
Охуенно Очень жду!
God I hope it’s good but I have no faith anymore in TV shows being brought back
I'm scaroused.
👍
I'm eager to watch this new season! Futurama is such an amazing show that I keep close to my heart. It's the first show I ever watched in English. It marked me, it's very important to me and I love it a lot!  I just can't wait to see those guys in brand new adventures! ❤
Kinda upset that they’re making more, this show has one of the best endings in tv history, and if Hulu messes this up I’m not considering it canon
Wow, the animation for South Park has gotten really good.  It almost looks like Futurama.  Wait...
Why? Why do this when the show ended so perfectly? Not excited for this and I'm just waiting for the moment they ruin it.
The uncancellable show
Cool that Calculon is back in the show.
Just seems so soulless
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!!
Why I Hate Futurama Season 11
''only on hulu'' well and disney..
not a single show in the world i want back as much as futurama
Looks like fun on a bun!
Good news, everyone!
AHHHH🎉🎉
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It’s owned by Disney now so let’s hope for the best
I still watch this show all the time! Glad to be getting new episodes again! Good news, everyone!
I feel like it shouldn't return, just look at the Simpsons, they ruined
No way disney doesn't cuck this up. They cuck up everything.
I love Dr Zoidberg.. i can't wait i am happy they a back.. :)
bender would never admit fault
Bring it on, im ready for new episodes
FINALLLYYY!!!!
Futurama is like my all-time favorite. I enjoy watching it better than South Park, american dad, family Guy, The Cleveland show and Beavis and butthead. I'm wondering what Futurama look like, if they did a live-action movie for it. I would say very interesting if they could pull it off
Futurama adopting 2023 events and all the past events from like the last 10 years is gonna be funny
That what I need. My childhood fav show
Fun fact: I named my dog after Scruffy.
It better be awesome.
Hope they do a Sons of Anarchy bit. 😂 Katey Sagal is Legendary.
Cant wait to see if they will do the building in (hulu) green for one episode instead of red. LoL
Probably one of Disney's greatest shows under 20th Century studios Animation. They need a ride at Disney parks maybe Farnsworth can get the Disney land people mover working again if Disney can find the funds to get the track back to a modern spec.
Letsssss goooooooooo❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I need an episode about how Zapp became captain please
I STAN Futurama. A top 3 comfort show for me. Please don't ruin this by being too on the nose with the references. 🙃🤸🏾‍♀️🫶🏾
At long last 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Didn't they already try this and fail?
SO flipping hyped right now! I watch futurama practically every night!
Best show ever.
Hahaha COVID hahahaha the same joke over and over for the past 3 years hahahaha 😐
Glad they didn’t lose John DiMaggio for vender
*We're Back Baby!*
The only acceptable reboot series.
All right, new Futurama show I was 11 years old when this came out
Bitter sweet moment, glad to have more and🤞 hopefully 🤞 good episodes, but sad to see the perfect ending Futurama had, be replaced with whatever comes next.
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Not sure how to feel about this, I don't usually like when shows closely mirror real world events, I want the sci-fi fantasy hijinx that Futurama is known for! I will still give it a chance though, could be good and I'm a die-hard fan!!
My daddy used to watch this
I felt the ending was perfect 🤷‍♂️
Something about the writing feels off
Death by SNU SNU!😂
I hope this show gets 20 more seasons I can't get enough of it
It's so beautiful
You had me at new season. No need for a trailer.
All I got to say is "In Bender We Trust"
This was my favorite show growing up. I've seen every episode and I cannot wait to see this new season!
I'm really curious how they figure out how to undo the series finale! That was crazy and sad and romantic.
This is the best news I’ve heard in a long, long time
YEESSSSSS
Well, I've fought it for years, but it looks like I'll have to get a streaming service. I'm a sellout.
*sobbing
META JOKES 🤢🤮
Scruffy approves……mmm hmmm
Hopefully this isnt woke garbage
Futurama is finally back after 10 years. About time.
It’s still coming out on Disney+ right? Because I’m not American
As perfect as the ending was, I liked this show, so I have no complaints about another season
Since Futurama is back hey everyone haven't you all ever noticed this. Out of all four these shows The Simpsons, Family Guy, Futurama, and American Dad. American dad is the only one so far that hasn't made a move yet or hasn't made a crossover special yet. Even Bob's Burgers made a movie.
It had such a good ending.. so why bring it back? Makes no sense to me.
going into the dumper, shouldn’t even release this, tis a travesty to the original masterpiece
I dead cried when I seen this man I binge watch the series all year around each year this and American dad are goated in my eyes man I hope they get 15 more seasons Fr
No matter how many times it's canceled Futurama just keeps on coming on my face.
While its great to see Futurama come back, the episode titles got me nervous about the new direction its taking. Cancelling Zapp and doing a covid/vax episode in preticular please hulu, don't use this show to virtue signal.... Guess we'll have to wait and see.
YES!!
Can hardly wait! Freeze me down a few weeks already!
Love it. Can't wait
is it just me or do the voices seem off?
YES!!!! lets go!!!! I hope Futurama found a permanent home so we can keep getting new episodes and new adventures.
In 2 seconds, you will collide with you destination  LOL
Good news everyone!🎉
Finally, it's coming back
Ok this year just went from 0 to 100
🚀 👾 🤖 it's good to have you 🌟 🌟 🌟  🌟  🌟 🌟  🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟
Have been grinning ear to ear ever since seeing this trailer when it came out. I love futurama the one show I grew up watching, most my humour comes from this
These characters marked our childhood, seeing them again is so ..... wonderful l love it
For years I've been saying this will comeback and to those who disagreed to what I said this is where I put my feet up on the desk and say ''told you so''.
Favorite 🔥
It's amazing to see Futurama make a comeback; however, now my complete series DVD box set will become incomplete. I sincerely hope a physical release will be available.
This kinda makes me sad. The final season ending was brilliant and touching.  This stains the series.  7 Billion of us and we can’t come up with anything original and good?!
With all the woke companies out there I hope it doesn’t ruin the perfect ending
Zero like of this season
Leela is a guy as a girl tuck tummy tuck
One of my favorite shows 😍 Can't wait for this!
Like 🇧🇷 👍
I like the way they explain how it's back again. I appreciate that haha. My partner and I just bought the complete series to watch all over again. So this is perfect.
Yessssssssss!!!!!!❤❤❤
Yes.
Futurama, X-Men 97! Now if only they could revive Beast Wars..
I’m back baby….40% back.
I’d be upset to if I had one red grapefruit sized eyeball in the middle of my head!  Bender Rodrigues 😊 They’re back baby🎉 🎊 🎉 🎊!
i’m so STUPIDLY excited
ermahgerd a day before my birthday, it's the best gift anyone could give me!
I’m so happy it’s back
Just be the same ol show we love (NOT WOKE) and it will succeed ❤
I love Futurama and The Simpsons
Looks soulless.
How many times has this show been revived?
New season? Well, this just makes me sad that Warner Discovery is erasing Final Space.
W Hulu
I can't help but be cynical.. Especially with the real life references. Nothing in this trailer had me laughing.  The crypto and covid jokes were especially cringe
Super hype. I've grown up with this show and it's always gladdening to see it return. Here's hoping that the new season holds up. This show hasn't disappointed yet!
Very excited for Futurama to be back.
The Boys Are Back In Town!!!
This looks horrible
Is this the 4th or 5th time? 😂😂😂
Sweeeet releases on my birthday! 😎
I would love to see futurama do a crossover with Rick and morty
I love Futurama and I'm glad to see it back, but I feel like the ending they had was pretty good. Hope this comeback doesn't tarnish the shows legacy.
Zoidberg sounds different.
It had to come back ... finally ... I'm happy as can be! 🤩
I need to watch the original
I was kinda with it... then they did a Covid joke
This has always been outstanding, I outgrew the Simpsons after 2 or 3 seasons but this show is always awesome 👌 👏 👍 😍 ❤
NOOO WAYY
So you've turned it into an animated Late Night Show, got it. I'm still going to watch but knowing that every episode is just going to be a liberal, futuristic parallel to modern issues is sad. I'll be surprised if there's a single non sequitur adventure the entire season
I was about to do a flip then saw a new season of Futurama announced
I hope they keep making this show until I have kids and make them watch a perfect show with no bad season 😂
I will not have another subscription to watch it... You know...
Yes!
Is it me or are voices a bit off... I mean I know people get older and voices change a bit. Is that what I am hearing or it's just the type of mics they're using and it's perhaps more "clear" or something. Like every voice I hear is not identical to what I used to. Again I may be the one who is losing hearing...or memory :)
I loved Futurama I'm glad Matt finally got back on Benders Back baby!!!
I'm waiting for this show with impatience. 🤘
YES!
good news everyone!
Please, let it die. For me, it stopped being funny the first time it ended early 2000's.
Lela sounds weird but I guess katey segal is getting on in years.
Cool
Been waiting years for the return! Can't wait!
Hope it will be available on other platforms as well. There is no Hulu in Poland
You know, I was excited until I realized they’d just be covering things that already happened in reality… that’s not Futruama.. I remember them being a delivery crew that got into random and weird situations.. not an ad spilling, “‘modern and woke comedy that everyone can enjoy!”.. Can we get a show that’s actually funny and creative and doesn’t bother throwing in anything happening in the real world. Is that too much to ask?
Really hope this will on Disney + in the UK. Dont think we get Hulu here?
New writers... You know what that means 🤮
Honestly this show used to be my favorite show when a kid I can’t believe there doing new episodes ugh
What’s crazy is that the first episode airs the day after the day I get to LA for the first time so I could probably watch this in the hotel room that night with my sisters lol 😂 I’m flying for the first time and going to LA for the first time and will be arriving there on the 23rd lol
Love it!
Finally, uplifting futurism
Yes!!!!
😍
Snu snu
according to how you see in the trailer that the series maintains its incredible humor, voices and quality, this feels bigger than life itself, as if one of your dreams that you never thought of would come back and come true. Cartoon series number 1 forever in my heart, all the characters are impossible not to love It's not just this show.. OMG we're gonna have more episodes of Futurama!!!
Aweeeeesooome..... I love futurama...
FINALLY LIKE I WAS WAITING FOREVER
I’m excited of course but some of the dialogue just seemed like it was trying way to hard to be “meta”
Amzing Video
My wish finally came true:)
No one can ever cancel Futurama, they just take an extended vacation.
WHAT
You had me with same crew. It wouldn't be futurama without the overqualified writing staff.
That is very good news
👍👍👍
This looks really REALLY bad.
Tears, very real too old to be crying over an animated show tears
Let's go!
I just hope they got some decent writers
My body is ready 💪😤
Bruh Futurama was always one of my favorites. So glad it’s coming back 🙌🏻 AND it looks good.
I’m gunna cry I’ve literally watched all 8 seasons 20x it’s my beyond favorite
I also need Fireflyyyyyy!
Good news everyone!
I’m conflicted, I’m excited, but horrified at the same time, considering how well the series ended. I don’t want to be another toy story four
The original series ending was perfect!!! Still, I'll definitely be watching!!!😁🙌🏼🚀
not paying to see this. no more streaming fee's .i'm dine.
YEESSSSSSSSS I've lived my whole life for this 😆🤣
Good news indeed everyone!
UGH IM SO FRICKIN EXCITED!!
Ура! Любимый Бендер, Фрай, Лила снова на экране! Буду смотреть новые приключения Футурамы!!!
So excited for this show to return. It is such a great show and glad to see the whole gang again
Its exactly how i imagined futurama coming back so many times and uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I'm in.
Futurama
Yes
This is honestly the best birthday present I've ever received...😢😢
Only been waiting 20 years 😅
Let’s gooo 🔥
Looks promising so far. Trailer gave me a few laughs. Hope it does well
My summer begins now! But more so on July 24th.
My hero pal bender is back…wait…. I better hide my money from bender. 😂
bring back SNU SNU ! please
YAAAASSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!
Was about to cancel Hulu cause really nothing on. But now. I guess I'll cancel after binging this.
Finally… I just hope the Disney overlords don’t water down the comedy and make it cringeful.
i hope they bring back the what-if machine
Yes! Yes! Yes! 🎉❤🎉❤
YES
A life with new futurama episodes is a life worth living!!!!
My childhood is 6acc
from what i remember of futurama it was funny,  but now in 2023 it better not be woke
This show is immortal
This show had some of the best writing of any adult animated show ever. Super happy to see it come back but I hope it isn't all slapstick.
I’m going to have to become American to get Hulu ain’t I
I will always never not need this show in my life.
If this show ever gets cancelled again they should make a 3 part theatrical movie to end the series once and for all
I hope it’s all funny and not showing anything we see today
Man i can't wait!!
As a "Flatty", I can relate to this.
Good news everyone!!! 🙌🏾🙌🏾
Futurama is one of the best…hope there will be a physical release!?
You know how rare that it is that all the original voices are back. Most of them are almost 70. They sound like they havent aged a day. Have a feeling this will be great.
Hulurama... subtle
can you imagine if they had really gone forward with not bringing bender back?? i am so hype for this
This seems like the good-old Futurama, almost like the episode releases never missed a beat. I'm very hopeful that it will be great
Thank you thank you my sweet baby Jesus.  I watch this show every night when I go to sleep.
There Hulu, I’m a big fan of Futurama and would like to subscribe to your services to only SUPPORT new episodes of this. The problem is, I am from Trinidad and Tobago, and Hulu isn’t supported in my country. Please do something about that. Thanks
I am so glad it won't be on Netflix. Netflix is just as bad as Fox when it comes to canceling really good shows after one season.
The fact that this trailer already has 7.3M views as of writing this, is insane. A lot more people are hyped for this than I thought there would be.
HYPE!
Oh no... I'm excited, I just really hope we don't get "Woke-a-rama". Kinda hope they avoid "getting with the times" and just give us the show. 👀
Yeeeeeesssss ❤
so excited
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I loved this show from the start and it just keeps getting better! I am so excited for this!
Is this a practical joke where the punchline is this was all written by ai?  it feels utterly soulless
Жду с нетерпением  маленький я мне всего 47 люблю футураму 😂😂
And it’s on a streaming service I actually have!
Now I gotta watch all the seasons over to get ready for this😭
I deserve this. I'm so flipping excited. I hope it's as dumb as Fry 🥰
Awesome, can't wait! I believe Hulu is a perfect home for Futurama commercial free, sold!
The last I remember isnt bender supposed to be in Homers attic?
That meme about old shows referencing modern things and acting like it's comedy is too real ...
I haven’t been this excited since it got renewed the first time:)
Unkillable
The later Simpsons, Disenchantment and _this_ seem equally enjoyable. What a trailer...
Please, just let it live up to the original
Hopefully it wont only be on hulu
Remember this premiered after the Simpsons back in the day.. never a huge fan, but glad it’s back.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
No...just no. Futurama managed to do what The Simpsons failed to do, stop before it became stale. Nothing in that preview makes me want to watch the new episodes. It's nostalgia for the sake of nostalgia, or to put it another way it looks like Star Wars episodes 7 through 9.
The show ended tho with a ending that caused a loop. When to these new episodes take place I wonder. Is this just the new timeline?
finally
I don't trust Hulu after the Animaniacs failure.
fav show of all time
looking forward to the neckbeard YouTubers complaining about how its not as good as the original.. then go on to proclaim their love for cartoon boys that dress like girls..
Brung it back to poke fun at the libs😂
I'm seeing dozens of callbacks while at the same time more present-day references. It's a new owner so I'm cautiously optimistic
We're so back baby
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooo.."takes sip of water"  OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
This better get physical release
YESSSS one of my fave cartoons for life <3
Oh no, more episodes trying to be topical but years too late. Covid and Dune references in the trailer? Ugh
This show was actually really funny, glad it's coming back.
Yes
Burro out.  Good one.
I'm into the current Simpsons episodes but the last season of Futurama was still really good so I'm excited about this.
Is Fulu supposed to be a combination of futer and Hulu? I think it is.
I was so sad when the show ended but I am so excited for the new season, this was one of my favorite shows growing up
I approve
Just binged this show for the 3rd time can not wait
Good news everyone!😁
Wwooooooooooooooo!   So excited!  🎉❤👍🔥🦾
I think this season will he good, I also think that no matter what it won't come back for a second season. I hope I'm wrong
😲 wow 😳
It's the reboot we didn't ask for, but the one we need.
why does a show this good, which is full of meaning and rich content, have such a hard time staying on the air.  When instead we have reality TV and woke garbage that has no shortage of funders.  society is collapsing.
Such a great show. Always enjoyed it more than the simpsons
The only show, I think, that makes me laugh out loud even when I watch it by my self. So happy ! Fry my hero.
Heck yea!
Sometimes, dead is better
Awesome
Most shows returning are some soulless cash grab, but Futurama is pretty unique for returning with heart, and that's appreciated!
The burrowing burro, Santa, and *observant* momlexa... 😁 I'm excited, good things feel rare. I can't wait to leave another season!
Sadly, it seems nothing new is invented. Same old characters and situations and references spiced up by recent events.... Come on, Futurama, prove me wrong
really hope they dont fk it over plz.
I missed this show so much 😢😢❤❤
The ending was flawless.
Super!
This show will not die just like fast and furious characters
The best show ever coming back? Maybe there’s hope yet for 2023
“Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.”
And I was literally watching seasons 2-5 the other week.
another thing I didn’t have on my bingo card this year
I'm not ashamed to say, I love you, Hulu!!!
It's back, baby!!!! 🎉
The covid ep better be called pastorama. Heh.  Placing all bets! Will the cause be subtle, or just flat out blatant. Like the virus starts from a space bat on Mars.
On hulu? I thought Disney owned it.
In a couple years, there will be an AI produced "forever" show of Futurama that never ends like the Seinfeld one.  I can't wait!
🎉
No please let it lie in peace
Oh boy can't wait to not watch it because hulu isn't in the UK
Honestly, I really hope this isn't as dead on arrival and modern episodes of the simpsons.
The revival we've needed all these long years.
To see the last episode over a decade ago. Just to see it come back again.  Is nestalgic. Can't wait to watch it again, but at least Fry and Leela are together now....
You know, I was worried at first, but just watching this, I cannot wait.
Thank you
Which has been canceled more, Futurama or Family Guy?
Futurama being cancelled and returns is the most Futurama thing I've ever Futurama'd. And now again. THIS SHOW is just 🚀👾🤖
I'm in.
Good lord, I hope they don't ruin this like so many reboots in this hyper sensitive political age.
So I’m guessing new season is going to be rated TV-MA? (With uncensored profanities?)
I'm still on season 5. Guess I gotta binge the show so I can watch that when it comes out
We’re back, baby! For good this time! And not the other dozen or so other times!
The references bro
Just let it die with dignity. We get that the fantasy sure didn't work out. It's ok to try new things.
So keen for the dune episode
Yeeeaaaaahhhhh!
As a sci-fi nerd growing up, I loved watching Futurama. It could be both sad and hilarious. Glad they managed to settle things with John DiMaggio. The show wouldn't be the same without Bender.
I am happy that Futurama is coming back for a new season
As of june 29th its gonna be the best 25 days of anything better than the 25 days of christmas the anticipation
Hypno toad in effect. This is so tired.
Sigh, guess i need a hulu subscription now to.
Can't cancel futurama, it'll always come back
I love you hulu! You made my day.
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Oh yeah baby, this is gonna be fun on a bun!
FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This makes me soooo happy
Yessssssse
this looks so good!!!!!
Best sitcom there ever was
No fking way, is this for real
How did they get the voice actors to come back
Yes! 🔥
Incredibly stoked but just by the trailer alone I’m a bit worried about the writing quality
WHAT
Just let a good thing die
I can’t wait to watch this show from my childhood again! One of my all time favs. Still looks good after all these years.
I'm a little bit torn because the finale was so good
Absolutely love the show, and this preview made me chuckle…but I still wish they left the show where it last ended. It was good enough, I’m just afraid this will turn into the next Simpsons, family guy, or South Park and have decades worth of seasons
FINE!!! Hulu... shut up and take my money... but behind a vpn cuz I'm in Peru... American Dad marathoon wooot!
Does this mean the remake is cancelled? I really hope so!
I cant wait! for me this was the original rick e morty
YEEESSSSS!!!!
YAAASSSSS CRLLLLL!!!!
this is all i have ever wanted!!!
Just wait till it come out on YouTube for free
This is everything I needed right now! 🤩
Okay I just got SO excite
Everything is here, and it all looks just as good as ever!
Good news everyone! ❤❤❤
YAY
Wait what? But surely the lasty season had the perfect ending?
Yes! OMG! Yes! I can't believe it. I was skeptical but these are definitely new and never seen scenes in the trailer.
Greatest animated show ever. It’s back baby!
i really hope this wasnt "updated for modern audiences"
There are no words to express the sheer level of YES that i have within my soul right now with this announcement. THANK YOU HULU!
Nothing can keep futurama dead!
Completely stoked that the show is coming back! 😁  Hoping beyond hope the magic is still there. 🤞
It's a shame you can't get Hulu in Australia. Oh well. I'll just watch elsewhere.
I love this show, but I've said goodbye to it 3 times. I would appreciate and end to disenchantment.
yay!
The smartest idea in the galaxy
Doodoodoo doo doo doo doo doo
oh thank god
Futurama previous ending was extremely emotional, I wonder how are they wrecking it to come back, is sure it will be funny, Bender Lives!!!!
I'm just excited to hear John DiMaggio voice Bender again as he's my favorite character from the show and the actor's filmography. Futurama was my first adult show to watch on Adult Swim and my introduction to Matt Groening's brand of humor before I watched The Simpsons.
Yay!
Cant wait to see how they ruin it for modern audiences. If it's just like the older seasons it'll be good. But I don't have much hope
I got a feeling it won't be know where near as the good as the 1st batch
i seriously hope they dont f*** this up.
Rocket Ship!!
GOOD NEWS EVERYONE!!!
Nice ❤
LFG! best toon in the wholse adult genre!! welcome back planet express crew! <3
😂😂😂 ok I'm  here for it 👏🏾!!!
Why do so many places incorrectly call this the 11th season when it's season 8.
Don't care about hoeul lol what about Disney
Looks and sounds just like old Futurama, but PLEASE lay off the current day references and gags.  That was The Simpson's schtick and Futurama was capable of so much more than that basic "look whats happening in our world, isn't it dumb" level of comedy.
🎉YYEEEEESSSS🎉
Eh.. something felt off about the later seasons and this is giving me those vibes too, but we’ll see
yea they back
Finally! Maybe I'll get to see someone get fired...out of a cannon...into the sun. I'VE BEEN HOPING!!
Only on Hulu? That's pretty disappointing...
wow this looks pretty amazing. i was really worried they would butcher the art style or character designs
It is made for Hulu? Oh so goodbye funny Futurama and welcome politically correct, castrated eunuch.
As much as I love Futurama, I don't need any more of it. By now the show ended like three times already, and every time it came back I was excited. But now it just feels like a nostalgia driven cashgrab where before it seemed like more of an earnest interest in bringing a beloved show back. Let's hope the show can live up to the expectations that come with reviving it once again.
THIS IS ONR OF THE BEST SHOWS
Except it won't be as funny, because after BLM and the lgbtq+ community they have to be so careful in what they say otherwise it hurts feelings 😑
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY !
This Reboot looks a lot better than I thought
I just found out about this! OMG OMG OMG!
So happy.
At least if this season flops then we still have the original ending looping back to season 1. This is like... an alternate timeline of sorts.
Aw, the original show ended so perfectly.
He's back baby yeaaaa
I'll be back baby. Wahoo!
The show that refuses to go away🎉❤
Can't wait for this show to be canceled & come back again.
This is one of my all time favorite shows
Sim! Futurama está de volta! Uma das melhores séries de animação da história. ❤
Y so lol
The animation looks way worse than before. This is SO disappointing..
I think i would have preferred hearing jokes about how lucky Fry is to have missed covid and crypto, but at the same time, Futurama tends to make those kind of stories work like no other show can. Excited for more Futurama!
Knowing how old Billy West is now, Zoidberg's voice is not the same as it was before
You can either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a villain don't let Futurama turn into a villain Hulu
I love how this show always ends and has a final episode only to keep getting randomly renewed some time later
Morbo is satisfied!!
I LOVE FUTURAMA but is that the same bender? His voice sounds different 😢
Everyone is always so excited for Futurama to return, until they actually get to see the new episodes.
Love that futurama is coming back! Now we need king of the hill to come back next 😊
The best good-news-everyone ever!
Ahh yes, my favorite US cartoon of all time, surpassing all others. Sometimes it made you laugh, many times it made you cry, but you were always fondly remembered. But hey, you keep getting ressurrected. Even if there are some dud episodes, as long as there are some really great ones, it will average out.
No retconning and we’re good.  “Crypto country” is cringe
They're... making.. a new season futurama...  ...  THEYRE MAKING A NEW SEASON OF FUTURAMA
I bet none of these scenes are in the show itself 😂😂😂
“A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.”
OH MY GODDDDDDDD
I've actually been binging all of Futurama this past week. What perfect ironic timing lol
If this is a Hulu show now, will it be available in Australia?
Terrible, absolutely dreadful they went in this direction.
return of the kang
Was my favorite show but now my shorts are better : ))))))))))))))))))))
Im totally subscribing to Hulu just for these show
I cannot believe it, I don't think any other show have ever been un-canceled twice
I did not expect Futurama would return
This is one of the first times in a long time ive seen a trailer for a revival of a show and actually got excited, it looks so good from what has been shown so far, hopefully it will be as good as it looks like it will be
Suprised Disney is allowing this show...
If can't wait!!!
Gotta say, I had a huge smile on my face throughout this trailer
Oh no.....
YES!!!!! GREATEST MOST UNDERRATED SHOW RETURNS!!!! Bender's back baby
All the voices sound way much older than before lol. How the time has passed.
Will watch every episode with pleasure! My favourite series of all time
Futurama never dies!
Time Machine backward?
Show must go on!
Ура!
I’m glad the voice of Bender is in it
This show has always been sub par compared to the rest of the lineup that was on tv at the time. Heres to more mediocrity. Bender is awesone though lol. The rest of the characters could be easily be replaced.
NO ONE'S EVER REALLY GONE
I still the remember the A.I Judge 👩‍⚖️ 👨‍⚖️  after seeing that I’m looking forward to A.I. H.R. department too 😂
But can i get it on DVD?
Big Meh
SOILD IT SOILED IT
Looks cringe
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
Only two things can survive a nuclear holocaust.  Futurama and cockroaches.
And they wanted to get rid of Bender's VA. Glad they did not!
Secretly everyone’s frav show as a kid but simpsons , South Park never ended  😂 Hulu took took the win
You could put 2 memes on futurama  "Did you die" "Sadly yes, but I lived!" And "I always come back"
looks pretty bad
I can't wait to see how unfunny it is because it has to tip toe around how sensitive people are now.
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!!!!
Need a fortnite collab
Fk AWSOME SO EXCITED
Please b good
Knowing this show is supposed to be an adult oriented Cartoon, and seeing so many Comments saying its their "childhood", makes me kinda disturbed and proud at the same time. XD
Noo the ending was already perfect why stay again 😔
Thank you Hulu for bringing it back!!!!
Shut up and take my money 💰
Its coming back???!!!
Wow I'm not into the new references. Crypto country? The COVID test joke that's like 2 years past being funny and is more so trauma inducing.
Makes me wonder those events I'm a late Philip J Fry and the second series finale would cause and create some kind of time space collision or overlap or create multi verses.
YYYEEEESS
SHut up and take my money!
So glad to see this show make a comeback for the first time in a decade 😂
WE’RE BACK BABY!
not so funny
How come Disney didn’t get it?
PagMan
Funny:)
YES. YES. YES!
有没有可以聊天的外国网友?
The forward time machine but backwards?
I can't believe this is happening. I am so thrilled but worried about the quality of it. Nonetheless, it was/is some of the most clever writing
Uncancelable!
I've lost count years ago of how many times I've marathon-binged re-watching the entire series. This is the ONLY series that I can do that with! More new content, yay!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
YESSSSSSSSSSSS
I’m surprised Groening even has time to breathe!
It's finally back!
How predictable, reviving a dead show to just cash in on current trends. Pathetic.
Good news everyone
I hope they didn't force 'wokeness' into this.
OMG Thanks
It’s gonna be hard to pull off without pissing off die hard fans and alienating potential new ones, but if any team can do it it’s this one.
Matt groening: We do no not want to continue the show without it's original writer  Money:
I’ll be honest. This is the most perfect animated show ever done. The ending is incredible. I hope this new season doesn’t mess with that.
Been rewatching futurama as my sesh show. Absolute adore the show such great writing, cannot wait for this new season, its been a looong wait.
Yeah, they won't make 90% of the types of jokes that they used to.
So... what? They gonna keep bringing this show back every 7 years 😄 Love Futurama, though. That show they made on Netflix as the antithesis to Futurama... that fantasy one... was absolutely the worst garbage I've ever seen. Bottom of the barrel, terrible acting, not funny, hack jokes, garbage. So, that's probably why they're having a go at this show again.  I just wish it wasn't on Hulu.
If the writers are from the original series it should be great otherwise I feel skeptical
Omg they are making jokes about COVID 19 but it is a future virus, dark humour at its finest 😂
WhAt HaVe YoU dOnE?!!??
i see (cringey pop culture references that have been done to death), aw crud
I love it! ❤
Keyword here is “Same crew”
Looool Covid tests really feel like that!
THIS IS THE BEST BIRTHDAY PRESENT EVER!!  THANK YOU HULU AND MATT GROENING!  ❤❤❤
finally some good news in this sad sad era of time
Good news everyone
I’ve missed this show 😢😢😢😢.. but I’m so glad that they are back 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤
*SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!*
not guys, toggaf
Never liked this show.
Cmon! I have the whole series on DVD I was hoping that was it ffs
That’s cool they have the sandworm from Dune!
I cant believe they get to continue it <3 (spoiler for the end if last season)  i dont know how they break out of the time loop with the button ❤
Well, looks like I'll be signing up for Hulu. I loved this show!
That radio on the last part. Ayo! 🤣🤣
Im excited but also nervous, most stuff nowadays is ruined by woke ideologies....will this fall to the same fate?
Hulu finally, after all these years, gets my money…on July 24th.
WE BACK BABY!
So will zoidburg still have his girlfriend?
I haven't been this hard in months.
Let’s just pray they don’t run it into the sub sub basement
Naw, matt cucking already finished the series to make that Terrible woke princess thing and now disney will destroy this by removing characters bc they're"probe llama tick"
I have rewatched this show 10 times over. i cant wait to see new episodes for once!!
Oh, this makes me happy! It's been too long! I've missed the gang!
Thank you @hulu well done 🔥
👍👍❤
My favorite show! Woooo Its back Baby!
Thank you Hulu… thank you.
I hope this isn’t gunna be woke
Love the show to death but I feel like it ended when it should have. I feel like this reboot, like most, are going to flanderize all the characters and get rid of the charm that made the original so good.
Futurama ended in that bloody theatre with the Devil's hands
Yay bender
Sad, usa only... its been nearly half a decade or so, and hulu never improves... wake me up when they let me watch in canada (no restrictions). 🙄
I'm just waiting for someone  in the comments to say good news everyone
The hype is so real. My body is ready.
They're gonna ruin it. God I hope they don't ruin it. It was such a good ending, too. I'm glad it at least looks like it and seems in the same spirit, I thought they were gonna completely redo it all.
But it ended so well tho
Perfect news!!!!
😈❤️
Bring on Paradise PD season 5!  Bring on Duncanville season 4!  Not this.
im confused how there goung to bring it back beacause the last episode made it so theres  almost no way for the series to come back
"Same crew"  That's exactly what I want to hear. So excited!
Please let this be faithful to the original and not just a ripped skin wrapped around politicized preaching about the current thing... I loved this show as a kid, love it now... I can't stand to see another cherished memory destroyed, but I want this back so bad...
Something tells me (part of) this was written during COVID
Man felt like they never left
THIS IS WILD!!!!
Can't wait for it to be cancelled again!
It’s my daughters favorite adult cartoon. She started watching it with me when she was 3 years old and ever since, she has never got tired of it. She is now 18-years-old and has told me that I am not allowed to watch without her. It would be criminal she said. 😂😂   Should be fun. It’s our thing. 😁
is it me or does the animation look.... jerky?
IT’S GUNNA BE FUN ON A BUN!!
YES THERE IS A GOD  😢
6 million views in 1 day.  That says something....very beloved show.  Glad it's back
….does the animation look a little…off to anyone else?
WE WANT A XBOX RPG OF THIS SERIES. CONTACT MICROSOFT.
Go-Go-Gadget late 90's, early 2000's nostalgia...
So this'll be, what, its fourth ending?
Saw a lot of characters in that preview, I just hope they don't bring back th---ALL GLORY TO THE HYPNOTOAD.
Greatest show ever created! Hands down!!!!
Cool! Looking forward to the Hulu revival of "Futurama" on a new Disney streaming app.
I paused Futurama to watch the new Futurama trailer and I couldn't be more excited!
Nearly 2 years ago I met Billy West at Momocon Winterfest back in 2022. It was fun.
As long as they keep John Goodman as Santa, we're straight.
literally the best cartoon ever made
I love futurama. I have hope for the TV again
It better be good. 🍿
Looks fun w/ some thought provoking notes on life.
the world is healing.
One of the most boring cartoons ever made is back???  😒😒😒😒😒
Bring. Back. Seymour.
I'M BACK, BABY!
Anyone know if its all the original voices or what ones are different ?
canceled all by subs but hulu because of this.
Yesssssssss!
It's not a Hulu Original 😂😂
WAIT SO IT CONTINUES FROM THE LAST SEASON? POG.
no way! NO WAY!!! The best of the best is coming BACK???!!! The good lord of all and nothing has heard my call!!!!!!!!!THANKS!!!!!!!!!
That show was just perfect thats really good they have new material
Sooo pumped for this , Hulu bringing the fire
I know I can’t be the only one who thinks this is the most random thing to ever happened like we all never expected futurama to be uncancelled
Funniest cartoon ever in my opinion. I’m glad it’s back just watching the trailer made me laugh.
:17 scenario of time travel was better done by Roswell episode familiar to Trekkies and by Opalescence episode familiar to "Man in the High Castle" fans to challenge Political Correct Popular wars.
Like bender sometimes says *“I’m back baby!”*
Futurama ended perfectly. I wonder how they will incorporate to the perfect ending. Maybe Fry and Leela remembered everything
Where can you watch in the UK?
Can't wait!
TORD?!?!?!?!
I was waiting for 11 years *lone masculine tear emoji"*
Everyone please watch this show there’s no doubt in my mind the first season back won’t be the greatest compared to what we got before, but there’s no doubt that’s they’ll have everything perfected again by season 2. “WE’RE BACK BABY” 🤖
Finally something good in the 2020s ❤❤❤❤❤❤
YES! THEY'RE BACK, BABY! WHOO!
Futurama for an entire new generation.  It will probably make them cry.
Love it!
The way the series ended last time was pretty much perfect, but I'm still happy they are back!
It’s going to be bad, didn’t laugh once the entire trailer. 😐  Futurama never should’ve been uncancelled in the first place, it was only great during its original run in the early 2000s
First
yes!!!
Ох как же я рад этому!!!!!
LETS GOOOOOOOO
Is Hulu free ?
ON GOD
There seems to be a lotta topical stuff from like a year or two ago in this
Game new Futurama video game stat
I’m one of those guys who liked Futurama more than the Simpsons. Can’t wait!!!
good news everyone!
YEEEES
I'm glad they're back, but I'm sick of having to sign up for yet another streaming service just to get one show!  Future tv SUCKS!!!
Man they ended this show perfectly.. Yet I’m super stoked that it’s back!!
I’m so excited that show was great I rewatched it on Hulu and finished the series again yesterday.
SCREAMS!!!!!!!!!!! IS THIS REALL?!?!?!?! OMG YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS i cant wait!!!!
I. Can't. Wait!
Glad it’s back! 💯💯💯

No matter how many times they keep killing this show it will always come back. And I will be here for every revival.
Is the Hermes voice actor in the new season???
No matter how many times it's cancelled and revived, Futurama will never cease to make me smile.
Thank you Hulu. Now bring back King of The Hill.
I might be mistaken, but this seems be from the people that bought us Futurama
😀😀😀😀😀
I’m so excited!!
Break out the Torgo's Executive Powder! The crew is back, again!
lets goooooooo
okay im crying
oh my gosh im going to cry I love this program!
Loved this show when it started...not sure that it needed to come back
I hope Matt Groening focuses more on Futurama content than Disenchantment because it just doesn't have anything going for it.
The goats r back
How are they going to end it this time?
Futurama is got to be the number #1 best cartoon show in the whole world like look how many detail they put to this
Really hope it’s better than the Comedy Central revival!
Nostalgia crew, pull in 👆🏻
YESSSSSSS!
My dad watched futurama when it came out
I hope it is the same good ol' daring Futurama
This is gonna be fun on a bun!
This show won't die
Best show ever!!
I am so glad that the OG voice actors are still around to give us the piece of joy again
Great Show 💯, Looks Great 👍, I hope Leela won't be such a tease anymore this time around
I’m honestly conflicted about this. I’m glad to see one of my favorite shows get a new season and all, but the finale truly felt like it brought the show the ending it deserved.  I really hope they don’t mess up this season, I want this show to keep its legacy of being great.
Just don't make it woke please. We don't need ANOTHER good show destroyed due to a bunch of ❄️
More please 💝  Seriously I’m happy and crying 😭
Everybody complains when it’s gone but nobody watches it when it’s here.
omg
Death by Snoo Snoo 😂😂😂
Boss
Wow this has me gagged
I couldn't have asked for more to celebrate Robanukah!
But will it still be the same?
please dont give it the simpsons treatment please please dont dont dont
The people who brought you Futurama, are bringing you more Futurama.  Good.
Whats wrong with the mouth movements?
Niceeee!!
Lit ep
Holy Hularama, Batman!
Wow- my childhood comfort zone is back
Finally!
I feel like I was just reborn I’m so happy.
Futurama will always be Futurama no matter how many times it’s cancelled and revived.  And I’ll be here for it until the very last series finale. 😊
Yeah... but I kinda don't give a F@¢k😅
If they brought this back ehen i was a kid my mind would have exploded so glad its back
Is this really the same? One will see
What do we want? Fry's Dog! When do we want it? Fry's Dog!
This will be woke garbage
Finally something actually funny is back again on TV
Tears of joy!! I can't believe after all these years I can now finally watch new episodes!!
Love how their animation has just improved over time
I absolutely loved this show when I was a kid and I can't wait to see new episodes. Loving the references 🤣
This better not be like the Clone High reboot
Futurama hasn't been any good since Season 4.
I remember when the show first aired, and being so excited, it blew my mind that the creator of the Simpsons create a new cartoon
I hope this means jon DiMaggio got the whole crew the pay they deserve
Please don't get woke, please don't get woke, please don't get woke...
I got Hulu for Futurama and Orville, and they are all out of Orville... ...you just saved yourself Hulu.   You heard me.
Why do they keep bring shows back from my childhood? I watched the premiere of futurama all the way back in 1999 when i was 12 years old.
Explain to me how Disney isn't going to put their rascism, sexism and Hate in this and destroy it like everything else they bought up and ran into the ground. I love futurama, politically they were wrong on alot, but take out that and it's a fantastic/stellar/hilarious show but Disney is buying out Hulu and they bought fox for an outragous sum a while ago which means their hands are all over this. The timing of this coming out is disastrous as hollywood is being consumed by their own greed and hate and can't put out a product that isn't steeped is hard-core social engineering so hateful and disgusting people are swering off hollywood because of it. I hope futurama doesn't fall like every other brand Disney touches as that would truly be a day for solemnity.
I can't look at tongs the same after this show.  The clamps! 😅
Excited to see the show coming back yet again. Hopefully this time after the 20 episode order if Hulu wants more the whole team will be unified in calling for better wages after DiMaggio showed you could have Hulu/Disney by the balls.
OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG
Can't wait to pirate this...
theres no way man, im bout to cry T_T
We’re back baby!
Guys stop Please
Knowing they weren't coming back until they signed Joe Dimagio is absolutely amazing
I just don’t believe it. This is incredible!
как же это охеренно!
Man gonna slap this yodie land cart
Jingle alone gives me goosbumps
my eyes........are sweating :D
Does anyone else notice the animation seems not as good on this as it did on primetime?? There is something about the blank stares and pupils that reminds me of web animation. I hope I get used to it.
NO WAYYYYYYYYYYYY FINALI, SIMPSONS IS SO FUKING BORING....
lets gooooo.
LEAVE FUTURAMA ALONE AS IT'S PERFECT ENDING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yay, Futurama's back! (In Calculon's back voice)
Beating a dead horse
That looks fun I cant wait to do it 100s of times 🤣
Wow, hulu come up with something new... let good series end. This is just sad.
oh the covid storyline....
0:52 Roberto? I thought he was dead
I feel like it’s too early to make a pandemic spoof episode. Half the audience will be mad for one reason and the other much smaller half that still possesses half of all decision making power will be mad for different reasons.
Yesss!!!! What an awesome show
Just please, please don't modernize it too much. Hearing Fry call himself a "flattie" and Bender saying "you do you" has me worried...
Hope woke agenda doesnt destroy this marvel,
I saw no indicator of SNU SNU 😮‍💨
Oh no.. they're going to cash in on this other dead horse now :(
Futurama isn't just back. It's 40% back
Good news everyone is back, Fry and Leela in love is back, Bender is back, good ahh tv is back.
Up
They're Gonna Show This On Sky Showcase And Sky Comedy?
Omg can’t wait ❤.
looks good. although I'm afraid they might go overboard with the references to current events and technology. you know, stuff that doesn't age well... eh let's hope for the best
I honestly can't wait for this show. I know John wasn't thrilled with pay or at least was trying to negotiate. I was going to be Hella upset if he didn't come back as Bender, but I also get wanting to be paid for your work.
I want new episodes now and every five minutes I don't get it someone's gonna get stabbed in the @$$
Dude yes!!!! 🛸🚀🍟👁🦞🤖🐸
Futurama and Always Sunny are legit only reasons to have Hulu
Gooood new everyone good news 😊
I hope it's not full of WOKE BS like every other show that's coming out
I hope they don't over-correct on the Bendergate issue and make it all about Bender. This show is about Fry and needs to stay that way, he's the heart of everything.  I also hope the writing is on par with seasons 2-4, which are the best seasons although the movies are all great also, well the fiest 3 are.
Awesome can’t wait! One of my favorite shows!
"Planet Express" ship over megacity parodied 1930s to 1940s pulps while "Omicron Persei 8" flying saucers parodied 1960s to 1970s film and video.  :26 resembles a Stephen Youll cover of a "Jetsons" megacity for Asimov's Prelude to Foundation"        :10 shows they have an alliance with "Mom's Friendly Robots Corporation" amid quadracopter drones for delivery,.  "Borax Kid" form Bender's folk singer episode about a three dimensional printer where a Replimat operator had voice like Dr. Scott Chubb  while royal family of "Omicron Persei 8" returns which is interesting since my MIT colleague recommended three dimensional printers while extraterrestrials represent international rslationships of human diversity.          :57 reminds me when I spoke with Brian Herbert about parodies of "Dune" where "Galactic Emperor" acts like a kid thinking a "Navigator Guild Steersman" in an aquarium tank to exclaim "I have a Choo Choo Train" or a scene where upon consuming Mélange excreted from Sandworms they exclaim "I am going through a mind warp" to remember how many remakes since Virginia Madsen did Princess Irulan.   :17 is a nice take on "Steam Punk" since they made Cultural Elite Eloi Intellectual Little Green Man resembles Jonathan Ferro while Troglodyte laborers called "Dumb Locks" resemble gorillas.    I hope July 24, 2023 season brings back both "dark matter reactor" to have cold fusion jokes about LANR like how they described Schrödinger's Cat and I hope they bring back Gigantic "Amazons in the Mood" variation to have jokes about how Arthur C Clarke's "Cosmic Casanova' of 1957 described Princess Leia as Gigantic based on "Amazing Stories Sept. 1946".  1:23 where Dr. Farnsworth aims some ceiling mounted device is reference to "Man with a Golden Gun"  and when sci fi pulp where bubbling with almost magical rays ranging from Tesla violet ray tubes to radionic theories perpetuated during Soviet times.
what
Futurama has always referenced very old events or been ahead of its time with views on technology. One of the highlighted gags being effectively "hey guys remember coronavirus?" does not inspire hope. Presumably, it's going to be a central plot for one entire episode.   Plus the mention of crypto. I don't think these horses have had enough time to get up and be flogged again.
Entertainment is healing.
goated show
My life is now complete 🎉
Cool
Well it's been nearly a decade (just short of it actually) since the last season ended leaving us with a hiatus that could have never ended. I'm not sure if I trust the current times not to ruin this show but I'll give it a chance at least and hope for the best. Worst case scenario I'll watch it somewhere on the internet for free.
So looking forward to this bro. I know im in the minority, but i hated the ending of this show. I despise when things end in a time loop
What for? Who asked for this? Futurama landed perfectly and on time. She did not have time to deteriorate like the once great Simpsons, whose corpse has been pulled by strings for many years, not allowing him to be buried with honors. The good must end in order not to become bad. And you are just afraid or do not know how to create something new and try to squeeze as much money out of the old as possible. I hate that people in the comments happily support this.
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I just hope that this ends up better than clone high
LETS GOOOOOO!!
It just ain't the same, man
I CAN'T WAIT!
Can't wait😁😁
Fox Network, then Adult Swim in syndication, then on Comedy Central, and finally on Hulu! This has been a wild ride.
New virus again 0:34
I'll subscribe to Hulu just to watch this.
Massive disappointment.  The ending was near perfect, one of the few shows that ended well, and this is going to turn into the next Simpsons just because someone wants to make money off our nostalgia.  Let it die.
Lo veía con mi hermano en fox, grandes recuerdos :)
Happy they got the same actors
Next...bring back Firefly!!!
This is my Joker
Its back baby! 😎🤘🏻
Oh man this is amazing i loved this show and it's finally back never think the day would come ❤
It’s back can’t believe it😖😖😖😊😊😊
10 more seasons Matt please oh please
Looks awesome!
This looks outstanding!
Eventually every streaming service will have its own seasons of futurama
No matter how many times you cancel and bring it back ill keep watching it
The most cancelled uncancellable show
Do you some people sound deeper to you…?
I haven't smiled this large for a trailer in years.
I mean I love this show but seriously how many finales does it need to have? I feel like it ended multiple times on pretty high notes. Oh well I'll still watch it but I think they really need to bring the show to a definitive END. Also hope this ends up on Disney+ in countries that don't have Hulu.
❤
Let’s goooooooooo
When I saw the commercial pop on my screen, I immediately stopped everything I was doing to come here
YES !!!
I don't know how I feel about it ... I mean it looks good but I've yet to see any anything made in the last 10 years that haven't gone woke..
OH MY GAAAAAAAAAWD
Wating for the day Disney+ and Hulu merge for this and other shows
Awesome!!!
Yeeeeeaaaahh!!! They're back baby🎉🎉
Yes! Freakin awesome!
Ok, i'll get a membership
Calling it now. There's going to be an episode where President Nixon loses the election and then tells his supporters it was rigged. Then he's going to have them storm Earth's Capitol!
what a treat. my bday is the 25th of july and im guessing that date is us, so im good to go
😀😀😀 John Dimmagio decide return...👏👏👏👍👍👍
Looks great!
Finally!
Shut up and take my money
Finally, one of the few returning shows that can finally have a great quality like before
Omg yes we all need this
The trailer looks good but I can’t help but be a little worried given how many reboots and “continuations” have shat the bed in recent years…
Oh your god!!
oh thank god john dimagio came back
Watch this show get cancelled instantly. Nostalgia is overrated.
What took them so long?
I hope Zap Branigan gets his own series.
Ahh but its gunna be woke.
Shows so good one of the best animated adult shows
:O
This on Disney+ in the UK. Can't wait.
I think this time they get a free sundae.
Been waiting like 10 years for this!
Yayy
Oh God, no. Fry  and Bender still sound awful. Their earlier season voices were much better. I’m not digging the humor at all, but I’ll give it a chance.
Thanks Hulu❤
زبردست ویڈیو دوست لائک کریں
I like it
It's so  good
Good news everyone!!!
Futurama had it's beautiful ending... please stop digging up the corpses of our favorite shows, Futurama is over and SHOULD be over.
Thank god they got the VA for bender. Wasn’t watching otherwise
Scruffy  !!
My wife and I can't wait for the return of this series. It is our show.
TRESS MACNEILLE!!!🖤🖤🖤🖤
WHAT?!!! This made my freaking day
Doesn't look funny, honestly. I can remember when Futurama was really funny and this doesn't resemble that in any way.
FINALLY!!!!!!!!! Hopefully, It is the SAME FUTURAMA! and thank you HULU for bringing back a beloved show, and not changing that much! Netflix would have tried to change everything about it!
I haven't been so excited for a show in a long time.
THEY'RE BACK, BABY!!!!!!!
Can't wait to see more. My theory is still that Frye is in a coma in the cryogenic place and he never unfroze, and the entire series is a dream. Bender, Leela and all the others are figments of his imagination... I know it's a cliched trope, but doesn't it make sense when you think about how all the characters get along with him?
Is there anyone like me who has loved this movie since I was a kid
Oh this looks so bad jfc
I really do like how it literally does just look like a new season dropped without any changes absolutely
"Stop Hes Already Dead" - simpsons meme
Them bell rings are so iconic
Matt groenings life goals: 1. Create the longest running animated show in America: the Simpsons ✅ 2. create the animated show to be cancelled the most number of times, to be miraculously revived each time. Futurama ✅
the episode where he sees his moms dream hits hard
Heard a while ago bender’s original VA wasn’t coming back. If he’s back, I’m all in!
It's the return of Scruffy, The Janitor!!
No woke bs?? i´m all in then!
Finally some good news in 2023
I... did not laugh a single time watching this. I don't think that bodes well.
Ah, timely COVID and crypto jokes. I am guessing like Animaniacs, the episodes were written a while back.
Think you god!!!
So happy to see this return! Let’s go! Uwuahh
Hello there, I just wanted to share that Jesus Christ loves you and died for your sins so that you can have a relationship with God the father and be restored. If you want a relationship with God all you have to do is confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus is lord and that He died for you! And turn to him in repentance. You don’t have to live life on your own anymore! God will change your life forever, I promise there is hope! He did it for me! There is a God and I am His witness. The choice is yours, have a great day :) God loves you so much!
Yes yes yes ❤❤❤❤
Can’t wait ❤❤❤❤
Cant wait
I'm excited to see new life in this show; but saddened to know it's happening on a dead network.
I really loved the show as a kid, glad it's coming back
it's back lets go childhood is back
I am so excited
Please don't F it up. Pwetty please 🥹
The Simpsons was the super popular show back in the early 00s, but something about Futurama and the weirdness of it at the time always caught my attention as a kid I preferred it more. Looking back, it's shocking how far ahead of time it was. Happy its coming back again hope it doesn't turn into a cringe fest reboot like a lot of other revivals (looking at you Boondocks Season 4), felt like it ended on a great note in 2013.
Ever sence this show ended the way it did I would often find myself wondering, what would they do for a reboot if the show ended with an infinite halt of time and Leela and Fry growing old together in a forever loop, but now I have one less what if question floating around in my brain.
Штош, ради этого дня стоило жить.
more and MORE FUTURAMA!!!
I thought it ended
Hulu fix your site.
I'm a bit concerned the trailer already made fun of covid, crypto, alexa, and the streaming service itself. Let's hope this won't become another animated critique of our current time.
The life-cycle of futurama: Is popular and gains a loyal following > is cancelled by higher ups > writes a poignant and emotional final episode that serves as a satisfying ending while also leaving it open for return > gets brought back due to popular demand > repeat cycle
❤❤❤❤❤
I’m honestly glad they’re now gonna be able to make fun of Cryptobros ^^
Meh
I'm inclined to ask as to who thought that it was a good idea to revive a twice canceled show?
Covid jokes 2 years too late.  My god let it be dead in peace….
I want to cry thanks
I loved watching this show as a kid. I still like it when I grow up, but it's my children
Of course they wouldn't resist talking about convid. 🙄
holy bazonkers
So glad Futurama's coming back. It's one of the best shows staying timeless that never falls behind
Is it just me or does the animation of their faces completely not match the actual voices? Looks odd to me.  Still really hoping they do it justice!
Your as beautiful as the day I lost you
I thought the ending was perfect. Hoping the quality doesn't suffer.
God I’m so happy this show is back.
I love this show because of how unique it is, it isn’t like the Simpsons where they do have they’re moments but back to the old usual stuff nor is it like family guy how it’s repetitive, not is it like American dad different ideas but same theme   What makes Futurama amazing is that there’s a story to it since the first day he fall into that tube to now   He fall down and was weirded out of this new time how everything is different and you can tell he was homesick missing his old timeline by the facial expressions and reaction he made to new things or that 1 episode when they went underground to see old New York how happy and excited he was, but also u see these characters grow and also get to see how they became the person they are rn from they’re past and current events like that whole story of lela trying to find who her family are who is her species, bender from a alcoholic good for nothing to a alcoholic caring loving friend who have done courageous things to help his family while also seeing his back story   We also get Zoidberg and how he met the professor   Kilf and amy from ppl from 2 sides to friends to lovers   And you attach to these characters not bc they are just funny but also because of how much they have grown and how people could relate to them   Me personally I related to fry me when I was growing up I came from immigrants parents so I was different from other kids and how some didn’t like how I was and stuff,   I relate to leela in a way that when I was growing up I didn’t have my mom part of my life and always wanted to know what happened to her where she is
God you answered my prayer but why you have to do it during the peak of wokeness?
"... We'll burro out!" 😂😂
They are back!
We all know the comments when it drops will be full of negative Nancies and Norberts. I'm just gonna enjoy it and relish in the hostalgia (and relish)
Finally!!!❤ love this show growing up as a kid made me love space and more aliens and robots it just made you feel like forget everything about yourself and joy the show 😂
It ended up on such wonderful note....
The problem is that nowadays they cant make a joke about anything , without offending someone and then  getting canceled by activist bots on twitter.  Sadly, any form of comedy,  even animated, is dead :(
Please don't give false hopes!!! I've been wanting this for agesssss
This epic suite of the opening track is just fire man.
I love futurama so much und am so hyped the show returns.
YISSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!
WOW ONLY TOOK YOU GUYS 10 YEARS!!!! I HOPE KING OF THE HILL DOSNT TAKE THIS LONG FOR THERE REBOOT EITHER 😮
I don’t think I’m going to watch it due to how it originally ended and companies kind of prey on our nostalgia.   When the season ends and I watch the reviews, than I’ll think about it
Only ONE thing came to mind when this trailer for the new season came out: ARE WE GOING TO SEE MORE SEXY AMY WONG SHENANIGANS?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!😁😎
So happy to hear this!
❤
Billy West is back voicing the characters again.
It is 2007, I am watching new episodes of Futurama, revived after being canceled.  It is 2010, I am watching new episodes of Futurama, revived after being canceled.  It is 2023, I am watching new episodes of Futurama, revived after being canceled...
Thank you!!! LFG!!! Ahhhh!!  So exited!!!
woo hoo! futurama is back! best show ever
Shout out Adventure Time episode when Jakes inside himself and the professor and Fry voice actors did a cameo
Why does this feel so empty?
Looks like a lot of that would have been topical about 2 years ago.
Shut up and take my subscription!
I hope we can finally see Fry and Lela get married.
They need to revisit the dog missing fry and mend that
Finally 🥹
Oh dear.  Looks like the end for good this time.  NOBODY wants a show that seems to just comment on current events.  We watch shows like this to escape from them, not have them rubbed in :(
Don't like that they are getting topical on things like crypto and stuff.  Are they also gonna make a "fake news" episode?
I wanted to hate this, because the show had like a proper ending and all. But it looks surprisingly good. Dang it!
Just hearing Bender saying “We’re back baby!” makes me grin.
Nice
So happy to see one of my favorite shows come back!
A lot of the topics they have covered already but can’t wait for the more modern twist. Have to remember the show started in 2000! CRAZY
Glory Hallelujah!!! They've done it!!! This is almost better than bringing back the Animaniacs!
Flatties unite ❤
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY! Is the only correct answer.
I watch Futurama like 5 time every year on Disney+ sad we don't get Hulu here
I loved watching this show so much I even listened to the commentary ._.
"From the creators of the Simpsons." For those of you who don't know what Futurama is? Those who have missed television since 1999?
Es cine 🧐
We're back baby!! Can we please get this show to season 25 now?
I love you hulu, archer, futurama, y’all just doing right by the community
There is only a handful of shows that  Shouldn't have been canceled or Needed to come back.. This is at the top of the list
Are we really so short on tv and cinema ideas so much that we need to resurrect this?
You had me at Robot Santa
Can’t complain mysef
This looks rubbish. There isnt a single joke. I guess it's for those American types.
It just won't die! And we love it
YES! ALL OF THE YES!
This is perfect! I've started rewatching all the old seasons these last few days, I can't believe I'm lucky enough to (eventually) have even more to check out!!  I'm so excited!!
I think they ended this show perfectly. I'm sure these will be great tho. Hard to end things as perfect and original as they did.
Everything changes, and yet everything stays.
YESSSSSSS!!!!!
So only on Hulu? What about the rest of the world, then? How soon until it comes to Disney+?
Honestly dont know how i feel about this. I thought the ending was perfect. Hopefully the humor is atleast the same.
WE ARE BACK BABY!
Finally!!!
About time.  There should also be an upcoming movie
oh joy. another series for them to reboot and ruin with wokeology. wish i could roll my eyes harder.
Finally 😂
How does this work with the ending of the show tho?? I wish they would restart from the beginning and do a different timeline
Still waitin on the new season of my boys show that was supposed to come out.....
Now we have more Space Simpsons , we need that King of the Hill sequel
Hulu aint in my country, where can I see it in LatinAmerica?
Frys intestinal worms are back!
I hope they’re able to outdo themselves since the official end of the show It was written perfectly
CALCULON’S BACK!
Yoooooooooo
Shut up and take my money!!
Please stop ruining things from my childhood.
Omg omg omg omg omg omg omg ❤️
Good news everyone! Futurama is back baby!😃
Только Футурама вечна под луной.
I really hope this is side story episodes and not part of the main story because the finale was perfect as it is
So now we have a show that’s been cancelled then resumed 3 times. Can’t wait for number 4!
I prefer this over Simpsons idk why
alr ig ht fiiiiine ill watch it
Хвала богам!
yes
WOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I’m not sure how to feel
Hopefully when it does come to an end again, it can rival the amazing "ending"'s the show had in the past, the last episode was perfect so please don't ruin this.
If only they could let the dead die
Are "The Big BangTheory" writers behind this?
❤
Yay more futurama 😊
Watch it end on a high note and brought back AGAIN on another service.
Seeing this after seeing the fnaf trailer for a third time makes me want to explode (i don't know whether in happiness or not)
Легенда повертається ❤️
Sadly seems to be more like the new simpsons humor and feel.. They try too hard to make old references instead of letting the classic style be the reference
They still better have deeper episodes that feel like the writers cared and feel longer than just 20 minutes because of that great story telling
Glad they kept everything the same, no point in changing with what worked!
Am I the only one that thinks Zoidberg sounds different?
chills, i got chills, this makes me happy, we might just save 2023
Why? This show had one of the most powerful endings ever that literally put it all in a continuous loop to make rewatchable for ages…. Nothing good can come of this being Disney/Hulu
Yesssss!
Yesssssssssssssss
Futurama trailer and Fnaf trailer on the same day. IM READY
The "Hulurama" part was a nice touch.
They haven't missed a beat.
ayo
finally waited!!!😄
Perfect
I watched this show when I was probably  way to young to and I loved it and I've rewatched it several  times over the years. Always was way better then family and the like. I'm so excited.
Futurama is back?  Nice.
A dream come true
one of the most underrated cartoons, love that its coming back!!. gonna rewatch everything before the new season comes out
Hearing Bender’s voice again gave me the biggest nostalgia rush I’ve ever had
Voices sound weird. Guess that's getting old for ya.
Oh awesome, I was hoping I'd get another Matt Groening take on COVID. Oh, and crypto and Amazon. So topical.
This show's never gonna end, is it?
Ive missed you
glad they didn't ruin the animation
heck yea
I hope the video game is next!
Yoooooooooo
Shut up and take our money
the Mighty Moon worm makes their debut
the Borax Kid makes a comeback
I am so excited!
seems we're getting a remixed version of the theme this season
Great they are making another season and didn't just go the movie route. Best show just hope I can find some way to watch it in australia
Hopefully they apply rule 34 to this season
0:38 I knew it , The Omicron Variant ! Their Planet has Also the Shape of the Covid-19 😂
I want to be excited, but man, those seasons on Comedy Central felt so tired. I worry this show is going the way of the Simpsons, where it reached a natural end point but then just keeps going and going, only instead of being stuck on Fox for decades it goes away for years at a time and then keeps turning up on different channels.
can't wait for Futurama to reference tiktok
Well I didn’t expect this……I thought futurama ended 😳😳🤨
I have a feeling it wont be the same. This already give off pc generic corporate vibes. Soulless safe humor, afraid to push the boundaries it once did. 😢
As soon as I saw this trailer I was like “but how are they continuing on from the last season!?” Only for that question to be immediately shot down 😂
So excited to see Futurama parody of Dune!
As long as not a single writer of today's Simpsons comes within a parameter of 250kms near the script and/or the actual writers, I'm hopeful! Awesome news!
W's in the chat
let’s go !!!!
Cancellation does not exist in this dojo! Does it!?!
1:29
Jfc can we stop working the pandemic into movies and TV
I really hope John Goodman is still the voice for Robot Santa
i’m here for nibbler
Welcome to the world of tomorrow!
Best animated show of all time
Their voices feel old. Especially Zoidberg’s.
Wasn't everyone happy that it ended? Because the writing started getting worse but the ending wrapped everything up neatly?  Why can't we just let these things die while they're still good?
bruh these zombie shows keep apearing
OMFG it's back?!
Cool to see they’ve kept the same animation style
I used to have that Super Soaker 100 Really hated those fuckers with the Super Soaker 300 🫤
why does every piece of dialogue not match their lips
Uuh, let's hope the jokes are better in the series, bc the ones in the trailer are a little basic
Let's gooooo alreadaaayyyy!!! Can't wait to watch this show again. It's been far too long
OMG I've been waiting for this for so long!
GOOD NEWS EVERYONE
nature is healing.
Best thing is. That I never watched Futurama until early 2023. I finished it and was downed that its over. And then imagine my suprise to learn that Futurama will get another season in 2 months time. One can say I chose the perfect time to start 🤣
I knew they would be back eventually
😍👍
Probably the smartest move hulu has ever made.
Pls no woke inserts
I'm so excited for this
Guess what I'm illegally downloading
WAHOOOO!!!!
Yay 🎉
I want this to be great, I just dont want them to ruin the memories of Futurama I have
where's Richard nixon
Yet another Frankenstein come to life from the rebootanator 2.0
Futurama, the only show to show how the future will look like
I for one welcome our new Futurama overlords.
This is the same futurama...at least for me
FUTURAMA IS BACK?!?!?
John Dimaggio is back baby!
But... The show ended... I love this show SO SO much. But please just let it die with a good ending. It was perfect .
Yeah but it ended so perfectly... Why risk that
Thank you Hulu for bringing back Futurama!!!! If you cancel this show I will cancel my subscription! Better keep it going!!!!!
YES!
Thank God, Rick and Morty fell off for me awhile ago, I needed this show back.
😱
Never thought they will be new show of Futurama
I WAS JST TALKING ABOUT HOW I MISSED AND POVE THIS SHOW AHHHHH THANK YOU HULU 🥹🥹🥹😭😭😭😭😭🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 Lol I’m gonna purchase Hulu now!
I hope they dont butcher this
BRING BACK KING OF THE HILL 😩😩😩😩
can we get some jurassic bark closure? 😭
I have been constantly watching Futurama episodes every month of my life for years, so much so that my DVD series collective box is a bit well used more than I'd like 😅 I was honestly pretty saddened to hear they were going to continue with a comeback; the ending for the original series was perfect, and I was very excited for them to continue focusing their all on Disenchantment. Already with the show being delegated to a streaming service I'm worried about a dip in quality and a change to less amazing writings for the show. Excited to watch the new season, but going in with a bit of apprehension that I hope will be blown out the window by an amazing comeback instead of something I'll be disappointed in 🙏
I really hope it lives up to the past seasons, Futurama ended on such a high note and I don't want this new season to taint it's legacy
Take. My. Money.
Oh my God I can't wait.
Next best thing to Rick and morty
I am the man with no name. Zapp Brannigan, at your service.
Yes!
Greatest birthday present ever
I know it was never an official finale, but the last episode was a perfect ending. I’m always skeptical with this long after reboots
Isn't this the 3rd or 4th time its come back go futurama.
Is it July 24, yet?
How many endings is this show gonna have
Thank you for bringing back one of the best series ever made!!!!
finaly?!.%$#@#
They're back baby
At last!!!!!!
I’m happy but kinda annoyed because the last ending was perfect
can’t wait
So much for watching the final episode to be told to watch it from the very first one again😑
YESSS
BENDER!!!
Just let it die. It's not a bad idea.
Ok, jokes from trailer already feel dated and it wasn't even released yet.
А была отмена Футурамы? Очень хотелось бы, чтобы юмор остался как был) без всяких новых повесточек)
hahahahahahahaha Oh wait you're serious, let me laugh harder. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
i hope they dont over do the pop culture references. i feel the show is at its best when it does weird sci fi things and at its most.... disposable... when it does pop culture.
LOOKS LIKE I'M SUBBING TO HULU BABY WOOOOOO!!
The new remix 🤘🏻🔥
It's going to be fun on the bun! Let's go meat sacks!
Time to rewatch Futurama!
This made my morning and I'm proud to proclaim that 😂💃🏽
it gives me a vibe of disenchantment and new simpsons, painfully unfunny
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!!!!
I just like how they managed to break the time loop via the construct of time. I'm a little curious to see what exactly they did to stitch together alternate moments to experience.
futurama: it just won't stay dead!
Oh hey the news anchorwoman came back to life or is this before a Bart-monster swallowed her up
My favourite show returning ive waited years for this..
As long as they keep with the raunchy unreserved adult humor that made the show what it was and not pander to the modern day sensitivity I’m all in without question.
Nice that Fry and Leela are still a thing! *We're Back Baby*
This will be awesome! Thank you Hulu or Fulu...That Covid episode looks hilarious.
They’re back baby!
Metalocalypse and now this. Truly living in unprecedented times
MY F*CK GOD! I'm so exciting it!!!
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeya😍
As much as the streaming wars/era sucks. It's also great because on special, rare occasions, they do listen to their audience. We got Clone High back with HBO, now Futurama with Hulu. Hopefully Hulu doesn't make the mistake Fox made...what, three times?
hope they don't go woke
Miracles do happen!
This was a *terrible* trailer. I'm hoping it's just edited by someone who's not attached to the show, because it makes the show look like every generic adult animated show that comes out these days. Futurama deserves better.
Just made my day, month year ! Awesome news
Yo this is awesome to see one of my favorite shows come back. It's been so long!
Now we're ruining Futurama 😒
New season?!
Will Disney ruin this, too?
Bender carried this show
YES
Zimmerman would weep to see this soulless cash grab
🥲 It's real
Can't wait for it to be cancelled again, only to return on a streaming service owned by a race of six headed millipedes.
I've lost count... it's this the 3rd or 4th UN-cancellation?  Show's got more legs than a millipede and I'm HERE for it!
m
Hope it keeps the heart.  And if people start complaining about the "current" references, the original was stuffed with them.
The show that wouldn't die
🍕👁🦑🤖🧪🍚🥷
Katy sagals still got it to play as leila
We can guarantee that if this receives well and makes Hulu a lot of money; there will be more! Futurama just won't die!
And just in time for Hulu to be shuttered by the end of the year.
I’m not ready for this because it’s only Something I have wished for in my dreams and Reddit!
The reboot we didn't need, but absolutely want (which is great!). Hoping this will be good! 🙏
Finally a new dvd set.

Hulu: "We're gunna bring back Futurama! With Blackjack! And hookers!"
Wow, I have NEVER seen such an unappealing trailer that made me want to NOT watch something.  And I DON'T just mean because they're beating the COVID and Crypto Dead Horses either, this literally looks like they took everything that was great about the earlier seasons, and removed it, while amplifying the flaws.  While Futurama has gotten worse with each reboot, it was at least watchable, most of the time, even in the later CC episodes.  This new Hulu season looks annoying at best, and cringe at worst.
I may have always preferred this over Simpsons… 😅 can’t wait!!!
I like how Bender just casually says "we're back baby"
Can't help but think of their "farewell" interview where they pretty much knew they were going to be picked up again after they got cancelled for the fourth time. They just keep coming back. It's their thing.
IM SOO EXCITED. this has been one of my favorite shows since i was like 3. and its good to see they still have more of the same humor but with more a modern twist (obviously since its been 12 years) with like covid and everything
The show that will not stay dead ♥️
No, they're not bringing this back, are they? They're going to ruin it with mid writing like everything else. If there were any shows I'd say had a good start middle and an end (from what I saw), this was a good example, leave it be.
Наконец-то)))
The Lord blesses us everyday WERE BACK BABY!!
Lets go
"Scruffy's coming back doing what Scruffy loves" *turns page of nudie mag*
Not sure how to feel about this. They ended on a satisfying note to me. The more they keep coming back, the more the show goes down hill. I didn't even like most of the eps on the last season they had, it felt kind of hallow. The covid and Crypto jokes also does not give me reassurance that this will be good.
It looks horrible, its trying to mimick todays events and be topical
Forget Futurama - travel back in time to the medieval town of Chillingbourne and face the Glue Man.
Im so happy they finally gave us bender back with his actual voice actor
Wow this animation is so crisp and clean and HD!😮❤️❤️❤️  SAME VOICES BUT JUST SHARPER ANIMATION 🤯
(heavy god-praying breathing)
Hulu is still unavailable in Australia without a VPN. Whens it coming to Disney plus?
Actually mad excited!
Is this real!?!?!?!
Dejavuuuuuu
Captains log - Zapp Brannigan is back and all is well with the world again
The Simpson predicated this!
Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you’ll ever hear. All of us, without exception, have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). And because God is just and will not let sin go unpunished, the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). As a result, that means that as sinners, we will all get what we rightly deserve: eternal punishment, which is called the second death. But the good news is that God is loving and does not wish that any should perish but that all would come to repentance (2 Peter 3:9). So He made a way for us to be saved and now graciously offers you the free gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ (Romans 6:23), all while justice is done. He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to die on behalf of us and pay for our sins on a cross, and He was then buried and rose again on the third day (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Regardless of who you are or what you may have done, if you believe with your heart the gospel ( ^^ which I just mentioned above) and confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, you shall be saved (Romans 10:9,10). Salvation is simple and free. It’s not a 12 step program, and don’t think, as many do, that you just have to be a “good person” or do good works to go to heaven. Salvation is based on what Jesus did, not what you do (Ephesians 2:8,9). Believe in Christ, and you will be saved. “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever should believe in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through Him.” John 3:16,17
Woohoo!
too many years, too late. i feel like this should have come out years ago, the fact that it is coming back out shows it could just be a cash grab.
Can't wait !
Why? Why are they doing this? The show was complete and with a good ending. Pathetic
Happy.😊
How many times have they ended and then restarted Futurama?
With the jokes in the trailer, this should have aired one or two years ago. Humor seems a lot less funny/topical now
Futurama is too good for Hulu.
The world is healing.
This puts a smile on my face
Me: 1. First, Clone High, and now Futurama?! 2. I guess 2023 is not such a bad year after all.  and 3. Does this year gets any better? Kent Brockman: This just in, After a 6-year cancellation, Disney is finally bringing the Disney Infinity: 4.0 edition back for their 10th anniversary which is first born on August 18, 2013. Now with the other 4 companies. 20th Century FOX, The Muppets, ZAG Heroez, and Blue Sky Studios. Me: YES!!!
i say it: they will fk it up
Why? The ending was perfect.
I can’t wait 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
yay im happy its coming back!
Jonh😀😀😃😃😃😃😎😎
Cancelled reactivated cancelled and reactivated again
I CANNOT WAIT for this to come out.  I hope Futurama lasts as long as The Simpsons
I'll believe it's good when I see it for what it actually is, far too many good shows/series brought back only to be dragged through the mud nowadays.
I hope they don’t mess it up  I would retcon the season if they do They had such a good ending
My favorite parts so far was Nibbler swallowing another animal whole, and "burrow out". OMF I can't wait
I really hope every episode isnt gonna be full of political bs like every other show thats been made lately
I can't wait
Hulu is the new home for Futurama ...
Ждём, ждём, ждём!!!!!!
What! Bender would mever apologise for his jackassery
Literally just finished rewatching the whole series an hour ago and opened YouTube to find this ❤️
eep
Good news everyone!
RETURN OF THE KING!
*"OMG... OMG... PLEASE BE "NOT WOKE"... PLEASE BE "NOT WOKE"!!!!*
YESS THEY'RE BACK
I can't believe we're closer to the year this show is set than the year this show started. Feel old yet?
Best Show Ever!!!!! Here's to ten more seasons!!!
OH MY GOD……….. YES
"Welcome to your new home."  "Our new home."  FREELA LIVES!!! I CAN'T WAIT TO LEARN ABOUT THE OTHER!!!! 🧡💜
The last ending was perfect, why do we have to reboot every thing man....
Good news everyone!!
I am beyond excited to see this!!! Me and my mama have watched every episode together and I am so excited to be able to watch them together again ❤❤❤
Easter eggs of disenchament
THE NASAL SWAB!! It hurt so much just looking at it!!
This may be the only show where I have full confidence every time they release new episodes
Glad they said on their twitter it'll be internationally on Disney+ and STAR+
50/5p chance it'll be okay. Clearly using topical humor. Idk man
"What do you say?  Want to go around again? " "I do" 😍😢
I’m not sure how I feel about it being Hulu exclusive, but I’ll watch anyway so
Take that! Fox!
I hope they don't break up Lelia and Fry
HECK YES
This is one of my all time favorite shows
Could have done a reboot
Let’s go
If I was a billionaire I'd just pay them to keep making new episodes for as long as they could..
Ahh super excited for Futurama to be back
I hope it's not like every other modern-day series return/reboot and end up trying to "not offend anyone", push some political agenda, etc
LOVES THIS SHOW
i love this show!!!!!
Futurama has a weird history, yet it keeps getting weirder. Also long as we keep getting great episodes I'm happy.
I CANT TAKE ALL THIS EXCITEMENT AND STRESS ALL AT ONCE, MY HEART CANT TAKE IT, MY PEOPLE ARE BACK AFTER 9 YEARS
Why so many pop culture references
Does anymore know if they managed to get all the voices actors? I heard benders wouldn't be coming back but it sure sounds like bender
W
I seriously never expected this
Okay, no signs of wokeness, so far, so good.🤔
This makes the world seem right again.  Until the nuclear war.
I'm more interested if actual Futurama writers are on board. Because "form the creators of Simpsons" - doesn't actually give them any credit.
Can’t wait! And I can’t wait for the inevitable 100th cancelation!! Only for it to return yet again!!!
Nothing will stand up to luck of the fryrish or Jurassic bark. 2 of the best episodes.
King of the hill revival please.
why
covid and crypto jokes in 2023, god help us...
I love this.
Should've just let it live in history, Corona jokes and crypto currency.. jesus christ.
Omg it's back!!! 🎉🎉🎉
I’m sad that they’re gonna cancel this after two seasons, wouldn’t even be futurama if they didn’t .
Thata cool!!!! Just keep modern politics and stuff that happened 3 years ago away from the show!
Ураааа🎉🎉🎉
Nice, can't wait to pirate it!
I love how Bender pronounced burro. “Burro! Burro!” While telling the donkey to burrow/dig 🤣
NOOOOOOOO IT SHOULD'VE STAYED CANCELLED OR ENDED IT WAS PERFECT THEY WAY IT WAS. let's see what happens next to these characters.🤔 See ya 👋
Better than Rick and morty
It’s sad. Now this great show will decay like Simpsons too   Should’ve let it stay ended in glory
I’M BACK BABY!
The show that refused to die.
Cautiously optimistic, just hope it doesn't rehash old stories and ideas ad nauseum. A trailer is going to remind us of all the fun things we liked coming back, but yeah bring on some fun new characters and stories!
Thank god they didn’t change the animation style that much.
We’re back, baby !
Shut up and take my money!
Produced by 30th Television Animation for Fulu
I thought they stopped making more Futurama?
Yes yes I am so excited YES!
Landscape me Kif, that’s an order 🤣🤣🤣
Number 3 on Trending? Hey that's pretty neat good on you Hulu congratulations! 12:52a.m. 6/28/2023
I remember 7 years ago hoping that Futurama and the Clone Wars would have new seasons some day. I can finally say that both those dreams have been realized
There isn’t a single bad episode, every joke is S tier. Never understood how this got cancelled but family guy is still going
12:50a.m. 6/28/2023
Can't wait to see Fry being a cuck/punching bag/ worthless idiot after all his character development with Leela. Definitely pirating this.
The good timeline
I’m super excited for this!
This is a good birthday present
I can't believe it finally back!!!
But will it have any bending is what im asking??🤔🤔
I love the episode game of tone's.
They are back!
Futurama and snu-snu make for an excellent evening.
Я этого ждал слишком долго и наконец-то Бендер уничтожить человечество😂😂 ЖДУУУУ
Good news everybody!
I don't know. Futurama had a really good run and a great ending, forcing it back may turn out horrible.
i hope the show has better jokes than this trailer
I’m excited, fingers crossed the cast and crew simply focus on telling a good story and don’t stoop to woke Hollywood’s level
ARAGGAGYBDEGWBVG
I have cried so many times because of this show. My eyes are ready for more.
YES PLEASE
Looks like it’s time to resubscribe to Hulu. Futurama is back AGAIN!
yeeeees thank you hulu
I don't see this as being entertaining and more being way to far behind the times for jokes about covid and crypto
One of the best sitcom ever made. Compared to Rick and Morty, though I'm also a fan of Rick and Morty, this is by far more hilarious since jokes are not just timing and s**t and stuff but just like the simpson, it relies more on political agenda and making fun of it.  Hope to get more season not just one.
I'm forty percent waiting for new Futurama episodes !
Oh no... covid reference? Zapp gets canceled? This honestly kinda seems like it's gonna flop. I was excited, but now not so much
Might have to subscribe to Hulu
Finally, the best animated sitcom for adults is back!
Hulu did them dirty with the animation budget
I'm really skeptical. I LOVE futurama. But the newer episodes felt like the new episodes of Spongebob if you know what I mean. Hope they got their buns together on this one.
Futurama > family guy
WKAUYFDKAUJSHDFEKAUJFSD ITS HEREEEEEEEEEEEEEEE LUWILEWO9O;LIRGKOFDLCVJ,B
Wonderful to see a show revived just like it was.
After all these years, The Simpsons and Futurama are still the greateast animated sitcoms ever, sorry Rick and Morty fans, but Matt Groening still rules.
hulu finally givin us something good
Aww... I'm glad it's back, which is why I'm in the middle of rewatching the whole thing right now, but I only have Disney+ where the rest of it is.
So! IN!
I almost cried! Im so excited looks like im getting hulu!
Thank you so much for this 😭🙏 please keep the seasons coming
Did Zoidberg just make a reference to COVID?
This show is now on the level of Scooby Doo, Batman, and Spider-Man with how many lives it get. The only difference is it’s the same cast mostly
omg yeahhh bb! :D
Yayyyyyy 😂
Man, this feels old school. I'm hyped.
So mom is more involved with the crew this time around? Ugh I can’t wait
One more time around, let's go!
Watching it all in one night.  But i wish they learned from their last return.  The topical stuff doesn't work.  Their ipad episode is one of the worst.  Covid and crypto episodes are gonna be pretty cringe.  Southpark barely pulled it off when it all was actually happening.
Good they got benders og voice actor
Yes yes yes
YAY
I’m so glad they didn’t change the animation
Looks terrible like the last few seasons I'll watch it still though
I will watch this show until the end of time. Again.
So glad there back for the third time !
Viacom To Hulu.
Can't wait to see what they have in store for Futurama,  always been a big fan since I was a kid. ❤❤❤❤❤
Nice. King of the Hill please.
2 saddest moments in history     1. when they canceled Futurama      2. when they canceled Futurama      Ok maybe the holocaust too
whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaattttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt, no way!!!!!!!!!!
yeah but, is made by the new Simpsons writer as you post on the cartel so I won't watch that. Also the good ending must be preserved as it is. Nice try anyway.
Bender is my spirit animal
Wish I had hulu...fox sucks 😅
Anyone else remember the great Futurama & Simpsons Hit & Run PS2 games? Those were the days.
Please don’t make it woke
AWESOME!!!!
Hooray, they're bringing back yet another good thing just so they can ruin it. I can't wait!
0:33 I'm honestly surprised that they felt the need to add "From the Creator of The Simpsons" here.  Even if it's true, after all this time Futurama is very much its own show and can stand on its own.
It’s been 10 Years
I sincerely hooe that this also hits Disney plus UK too. As well as animaniacs.
IT ENDED WITH A GOOD LAST EPISODE. LET IT DIE.
I only like bender
But why, when companies milk shows dry and more show gets ruined. After few season quality of writing drastically drops and I don't think it will be just one more season
👏
Can we appreciate how they tried their best to make this amazing video for us 😍😍😍😍
I think Hulu just sold me a subscription
Oh my god just let it die already
So is it actually John DiMaggio?
Yay reddit!
I think it should have remained discontinued. Hopefully it's not a cash grab that ends up ruining the overall serious.
Futurama for me ended after S4- I never got back to the newer stuff even though I deeply loved those first four seasons. But I’m thinking it might be time to get back to it.
I don't think this is necessary. We already had a good ending....but I'm not complaining.
Futurama, welcome from being canceled/ending for the 7th time
So, how much y’all wanna bet this is gonna turn out like the modern Simpsons?
Futurama is almost like the simpsons both cant  finish despite finish each of their seasons  Simpsons is about to be season 35 and futurama Is in season 24 and  I think some point Simpsons may be come to a end after long years  which shows most likely to surpass that  mark of most seasons
Can’t wait. Love Futurama
I would say I really needed this, but come on, WE ALL NEEDED IT.
This is one of the best days of my life.
Love the show but it ended great. I doubt they will do better. Let's see what happens.🎉
I'm kinda excited for this season of Futurama man.. it looks pretty good!
Great now bring on King of the hill!
Awesome
Futurama is my favorite cartoon of all time! I'm so excited!
Very excited please just don’t member berries it to death
Yes ❤
Great another classic show to ruin
Omg I can't wait. Too bad no Hulu in Canada. Thanks CRTC
Thank You for bringing this back!!!
I couldn't be any happier than I am right now!!
Last time the show got canceled and then came back it had some great episodes, a lot of just okay episodes, and then some flops. I figured this is going to be the same, I'm genuinely really happy that we are getting more because I have seen the entirety of Futurama a couple times. One of my all time favorite shows, feeling pretty optimistic
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Great!
Please re-release a remaster of the video game.
Love this show can't wait to watch it with my family! Happy to see someone was smart to bring this show back! Let's go!!
Let's Go!
please, please, please don't be bad
The devils hands are idle play things should have stayed the last episode.
I can't stop smiling, this really has a feel of the old series - can't wait to watch it. (where will it be shown in the UK? anyone know?)
:O LETS GO YEAAAAAHHHHHH BOIIIIIIIIIIIII
Hahah great 👍
It's not Futurama without bender, can't wait
As long as fry and Lela are still married I’m happy
Again?!
I hate living in Mexico with no Hulu
"WE'RE BACK BABY!"
I loved the ending before, but always glad to see it be back baby!
No way!
LFG. Hope it’s good
Wait, WHAT?!! Good News Everyone!
booooo
I hope it's better than the Comedy Central seasons.
Does zioberg sound a bit off?
Futurama has always been the best animated tv show over all the others. They simply have a solid platform in which they can take each story in whatever direction they want giving the show endless possibilities.
After so long, having Futurama return AGAIN is the best thing ever!
Futurama is one of those rare shows I don't remember much about but if I watch an episode I know every line and remember watching it 20 times in vivid detail. Camping trip when I was 9? Yeah that was right after I watched the Mars episode where they crank the heat and the cold air at the same time.
Yesss!!! I've been hoping they would come out with a new season 4ever💯❤️🥳
Algumas coisas nunca mudam kk
REVIVE FRY'S DOG!
Why
I hope we get 24 episodes
Yes, thank God it’s back and Hulu
0: Good 001: Uniqueness 01: Consent 1: Ethics 2: Problem-Solution 6: What? Who? Why? When? How? Where? 10: Net 11: Justice 21: Solving Problems With Ethics 99: Revolution 100: Liberation
In the year 1,000,000 1/2, the human kind is enslaved by the giraffe…man must pay for all his misdeeds, when the tree tops are stripped of their leafs.
They’re back baby!
POP
They have to go back and desecrate the purity with these callbacks.  The OG worms episode was S tier, nothing written after the original series is better than B.  Let it die.
WOO!!!!! FUTURAMA IS BACK!!!!!
Life is good now! Now I am happy in life.
Ughhhh, corporate greed man, they tried to make new stuff and it all miserably failed, “lets being back the one show that ended perfectly!” But now theyre adding covid and crypto jokes AND EVEN ALEXA JOKES!!!! This is gonna be painfully bad, calling it now, only thing riding on it is nostalgia, which is what theyre counting on.
Can't wait to be disappointed.
I hate these soulless trailer styles that tell you nothing about the story and have all the cliches like the music pausing before the punchline
Lets hope they dont milk it to death
I cant wait for the inevitable cancellation that ends with a gut wrenching final 1-2 minutes.
As I say, it shall be so!
no
W show
Good news everyone!
oh no.
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!! JUST ABOUT THIS NOOOOWWWWW.... YESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I remember when I moved to usa. That was the first show I watched and loved
Yes it's back baby
IT COMES OUT ON MY BIRTHDAY :D What a present!!!!!!
*YES!! YES!! YES!! YES!!*
I don't want Futurama to become like the Simpsons , I want Futurama to be like Braking Bad ( Beginning, Middle and End ) great stories need at End  and Futurama had a Great Ending already , Please do not Milk this anymore 😭😭😭😭😭
Cool! Now they can make Leela a mandatory woke lesbian to please twitter Karen's! Hooray!
I was excited but then I realised they fell into the trap of making topical episodes that don’t come out till like a year after the topic was relevant ie Covid and crypto
Futurama's back??? LET'S FUCKEN GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
This is gonna be perfect anyone who doesn't like it for some reason perhaps keep it to yourselves both sides just shut up y'all are equally annoying.
Is this gonna be on disneyplus also like the original?
-insert I'm so excited gif here-
Futurama has been brought back to life more times than Wolverine
NOOOOOOOOO LET IT DIE. it was so good now disney is going to ruin it. why would you do this
I hope this series lasts longer this time
Nice, but why hulu?
What the ever loving f**k?!?!
So awesome ❤❤❤ it
NO WAY!!!!!!!
Oh I really hope this isn't a soulless cash grab. Especially since they ended it so well... time will tell
i’m so ready 😁
WHY!?!?!?! The ending was so so good though.
I’m so hyped
I hope it’s good 🤔
Отлично! Давно ждал
It's dead, don't ruin this shows name just let it lie
All we need now is a new GTA and we can fully regress back to when we were 12 again
Fingers crossed Leela goes Gaga this season
Hope this will get release to dvd or blue ray because i dont have hulu
It's gon' be fun on a bun!
im excited as heck for this but i know ill get disappointed on the fact they most likely just did 8 episodes or less
It gives me a bad vibe because the same thing happened to me with the Simpsons in the 2010s
To shreds you say?
This trailer is poorly edited, but I'm all for it
I can't wait. Futurama has gotta be my fav show of all time. I love that it's coming back again!
YOOOOOOO
The premises look un creative but I hope it’s really good😭
Epic Soyjak! Let's Serialize Futurama Until It Stops Mattering! When Groenig Is Dead, Let's Crush His Corpse In A Blender And Extract The Funny! Thirty More Seasons!
Im so happy their bringing this back.
Ya Pass. I don't trust you guys one bit. I don't trust Americans at all. MINIMUM Zoidberg comes out as they/them, Fry is in love with Bender and the latter identifies as a human. 10 out of 26 episodes are going to be lectures, 6 about how Climate Change will destroy the Galaxy, and the other 10 how Brannigan is a YT Supreme. Pffff
Yes, Please.
🤌
Only show I could watch over and over and never ceased to entertain. Excited af for this revival.
Hulu's best decision ever made
we bought futurama
I grow up with the show i cant wait to see what happens i really hope its good
Ohh, I can tell there are some good episodes in here!
This better make me cry, of laughter and saddness.
They better not ruin this like they did the simpsons
THEY'RE BACK, BABY!
Look at all these brainless NPCs in the comment section
Hulu: we have rebooted futura- me: "shut up and take my money"
I already know the ending is gonna break my heart AGAIN SOMEHOW
This sooooong OMG
Yaaayyyyyy
Mmm, nice resurrected corpse
Will fry and Leila be a couple in this new season since they got married in the last episode
We’re back, BABY!!!
Soooo....does the ship not have air brakes anymore ?
This is the best classic tv news I've heard in awhile.
When are you going to stop making people pay for ads? That's when I'll come back.
One of the best shows ever
absolute w
Hulu nailed it this time
Let's go already!!!
I'm getting Hulu JUST for that idc
Is this the light on the other side escaping the cursed covid years???
Yes!
Looks better than the Comedy Central era futurama
No more Rick and Morty! Now a Futurama reboot!
Let good things die
i cant wait to watch it :D Back to the Past! just like Clone High but also different idc also YES! they back Baby!
im a bit scared, but in all fairness they did end this show 3-4 times so it will probably be okay.
Good show
🎵 Let’s Go Already!!! 🎵
good news everyone they are back
We live in this timeline.
I have a lot of faith in this reboot!
overrated show. meh
Yes!!!!
as someone who watched the show a lot when I was a kid, I'm not sure how to feel about Futurama coming back, but I will admit it'll be nice to see the crew again after so long
The cel shading on the ship when its a 3d model looks phenomenal
Dang im kinda suprised they brought this back. Its like if the simpsons got cancelled 10 years ago, and just comes back
Can't keep a good show down. Looking forward to the new season!
i cant wait! i hope its the same way as before. I used to watch it all the time during some tough times it really gave me a break form stuff. it was such a good show. I still have some of the dvds :]
I always thought Matt Groening should have ended the Simpsons and focused on Futurama when it came out..
the show was literally over when it ended
6
While I love that the show is coming back, I hope they don’t mess up the awesome ending of the original run. The way it ends with a perfect loop back to the start was just magnificent.  Edit: Hi, Mom 👋
They ended it perfectly some shows don’t need to be revived and remade. I hope they don’t mess this up
🎉🎉🎉🎉
anybody else have the concern that we are about to find out that this show has gone woke?
In 2023 I don't know how well this will be honesty. Some things just don't need to come back so they preserve the good that the original was.
Still dont think it needed a new season but i think it will be great
Oof bringing things back after such a perfect beautiful ending... who am I kidding I'm going to watch this.
Omg yes, thank you, give the person at Hulu who thought of this a raise!!!!!!!!
As much as I loved the series, it had a satisfying ending, I’m kinda torn about this.
cool, they finally got benders VA to get onboard
HAAAAAAAAAA, haaaaaaa haaaaaaaa… HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
This show has been cancelled like 4 times, and they nailed the ending each time. Can they do it again?
looks terrible. nothing's funny about the last decade or so.
Zap brannigan is futurama
You better bring back snu snu. If not, 1 star
Cannot wait to see how they ruin Futurama
YEAHHH ZAPP BRANNIGAN IS BACK
You better not mess this one up, Hulu
Love the show, but not worth having hulu. Will watch when it goes elsewhere.
YES YES YES!! I was just thinking about how futurama would satire today's modern stuff, Im interested to see what they do for the aI stuff since MOM and robots heavily exist in the universe there.
It's going to be just as bad as the last few seasons, I can tell with the really lazy COVID episode premise
I cant wait
Soooo Awsome I’ve been waiting so long for this léela and Fry need to end up together I’ve been recently are-Watching for the 20th time can’t wait for July 24🎉
Not gonna lie this looks bad
That was oddly surprising 😮  Thought the ending was perfect with the time loop sequence back to the beginning of the first episode.
Yeah Futurama!!!!🎉🍾
Can't wait to not watch this because streaming services are overpriced
Can’t keep the Planet Express crew down! They’re back at it again. Can’t wait.
My favorite show gets more episodes 😊
Just when Futurama is stuck in a time loop, we’re back!
Super boring , they waited too long…
RIP Kwanza-bot.
He many times are they going to reboot futurama
Haha, Zapp’s coming back?!?!
I feel like I'm alone in the opinion that the Comedy Central era of Futurama wasn't any good. With the exception of one episode. You know the one. This looks like more of that, which is really disappointing.
I’m really glad they brought back The Zoidberg Show!
My childhood has returned!
les go
So where do I watch it if Hulu isn't in my country?
There are some shows people can just turn on to relax even if you have seen it hundreds of times... this is the #1 for my family and we are happy it is back again baby!
Dude is three times they brought it back?
If this gets canceled again I'm never watching anything related to who made this series ever again.
You guys think Jurassic Bark was sad? My dog had just died and I was looking for something funny to watch, I was like Jurassic Bark funny name ...
This was always my comfort show. Since coming to Hulu I always put it on to go to sleep. Either Futurama or South Park. Seeing the characters again will be fun.
Bender!!!
Bro that ending but bender saying he deserved is fair XD 😂
these jokes are moldy
heard theres a bunch of woke bs in this new one
The show had a very satisfying conclusion I wonder how they will rectify that or if they will even mention it.
ON MY BIRTHDAY?! what an amazing gift
Good news, everyone.
Oh no, really dissapointed in this. The show ended, just because Disenchantment wasn't a hit doesn't mean you have to exhume a beloved dead franchise.  I really hope this has some of the soul of the original series, but it looks like a reference heavy, cash grab to me. I really hope tht I'm wrong.
So... They're NOT rebooting it?
im excited for this. please dont mess it up hulu
Don't worry fry here we call you a bannock bum or a Canadian long back
I can't wait to see how they take on modern day tech craziness.
I LOVE FUTURAMA 🤩❤
I don’t know why futurama is getting another chance but I like it
I can’t wait to see more Zapp Brannigan. I’ve watched the compilations of him far too many times. I need fresh content
First Fox, Soon Disney
Here at 2,114,874 views.
IM SO HAPPY !!!!
I hope it’s not unnecessarily raunchy and adult for no reason.
It’s back!!
After so long, having Futurama return is the best thing ever.
...it kinda looks not good
why bring it back it had a god ending bruh
I'm just worried that the script has become bit dated since guessing it was done in the peak of covid. You know like nfts were a big thing for about 6 months
Burrow, burrow 😂
so we get mom, covid, crypto jokes, alexa, West World,  Hulu acquisition , streaming jokes, meta about the last episode. what more can we ask for.
Futurama makes its return the day before my birthday!
Oh, Futurama. How I missed you.
I've never been so excited to see all the cast back together and a new season! cannot wait!
This looks awful.
For F's sake, somebody make an original idea instead of digging up the corpses of shows that ended gracefully. I can already see how "topical" and 2 years too late all of these jokes are going to be. Futurama had a good run. Leave it in peace!
Didn’t expect to wake up to this 😂
It looks bad, low fps and stiff animations. It feels bad, >le current events jokes and references.  And freaking really? Covid and crypto episodes 3 years after the actual events? I will be very surprised if it won't turn out a complete dumpster fire of a season.
I remember someone posted a comment that said “I hope Bender’s first line after the revival would be ‘we’re back baby!’” And sure enough that’s what we got 😆
WHAT THANK GOD
frys worms returned.
I love Futurama but just no! The way they ended the series with Fry and Leela growing old together, living their lives as the world was frozen in still around them then deciding to go back in time when Professor Farnsworth was able to break it was a perfect ending.
Love it, just hope however long it goes it doesnt end on ANOTHER open ended "will they wont they" shtick
I hope they don’t end up trying too hard to bring back Futurama.
This really puts hulu back on the map.
Why is it coming back for no reason
Can't wait for Disney to ruin another franchise to the ground as subpar streaming content.
Whyyyy hulu 😅😢
WHERE MY FUTURAMA SLEEPERS AT?!
LET'S GO ALREADY
we're back baby!
Everyone who’s subbed to Hulu already watch within 9hrs 🤖 🚀
i love this tv show growing up and im happy its back
Words cant explain the excitement I have
I've been waiting for this for many years
It’s good to see them again
I'm so glad the show is a continuation 😭
all new heroes
It looks like the humor has gotten slightly worse but besides that, im excited. I wonder hoe they will continue the show considering how it ended. Will the episodes take place before the ending or after it? I assume after because of the references to covid but you know.
I can guarantee you 100% that the show will be very woke
Good news everyone
This is going to be the funniest show of 2021.
I hope this is good. Futurama had a good ending and I had closure. If they dug this up just to fill it with bad writing and bury it again that’s gonna hurt.

Tfw you're getting Hulu b/c Futurama and KOTH
How many times has this series been revived to only be canceled again? First it was on Fox, then I think Cartoon Network? Somewhere Comedy Central took it, now Hulu?  Like bro, I love the series like everyone else, but sooner you're gonna realize nostalgia doesn't power something you love, especially when a series like this always wants to reflect on modern elements and topics - that tells me that even though it's still satire, it ain't original. Old Skool Futurama had so much originality, genuine comedy, and the series ended on a really good note.  Now it's just being milked to get views on a streaming platform so Disney can crunch it's numbers. Not cool.
Can't wait to see them returning 😃😁
Not a fan of this show, but wasn't it done and had a good emotional ending?
Yesss🥹🥹❤️💯💯
Omg Scruffy I was so worried
It looks good! I can't wait to watch it!
I'm all in
Gonna be woke garbage
Good to see the entire cast back especially Phil LaMarr who is one of my favorite voice actors, one can only hope they don't mess this up.
Did they invite the voice of Bender back? Because it probably isn't watchable without him.
📸 neat.
yesssssss
Ayo, they coming back?
stop.... please, just stop.....
God I hope they don’t ruin it
Can’t wait.. love this show and didn’t see it returning tbh. I guess it will also be on Disney+ then ? 🙏
ESTAMOS DE VOLTA, BABY!!!
Don’t cancel. Ever, never again. Forever air, never cancel.
I am cautiously neutral about this new season and trying to hae no strong feelings about it one way or the other. On one hand I love existing futurama, on the other hand I know what creature current simpsons is and I worry a little about the covid and crypto "modern reference" type jokes
ok yeah make me sad and it will be complete
I just love it when John Dimaggio gets more work. He's a national treasure.
Yessss!
Timeless
Woo hoooo
Love the call back to the worms that were in Frys body. Also love the covid nose swab joke 😂
I love you guys so much for doing this dudes!!  Thank you for bringing the show back yet again!
Can't wait for the Covid 19 Parody Episode.
THANK YOU for keeping the animation, voice actors and characters the same (from what I can tell.) They broke the formula of bringing something back and not changing things.
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO YEAAAAAAH BABYYYYYY THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THAT'S WHAT ITS ALL ABOUT, WOOOOOOOOOOOO!
This trailer tells me it's the same mistakes they made before. Looks like Futurama still finished with Fry's opera, and never came back.
So we will be back to normal in 2547? Good thing the post covid crisis has an end at time when christmast trees were to be wiped out.
Gonna binge this in celebration😅
🥹
Awesome! Hoping they bring back Disenchantment too! Really dug that show
GOOD NEWS EVERYONE!
I can't wait
Well, after a looong looong while, it backs!!! 😊🎉
the fact that they got the entire original VA crew back already makes it worth watching .......I am hoping so much for a 24 episode season and animaniacs may not of been able to do it but knew futurama would do a COVID episode lol
Biggest W of 2023!
I’m so happy. This is one of my all time favorite shows. I always worry about dips in quality, but i feel like being off the air for 10 years gives the writers more time to actually be creative and make quality content.
I hope the jokes are more subtle than those. Everything is turning into Family Guy nowadays.
It's like it never left us.
They’re bringing it back again.
look at Futurama being relevant three years ago. that's how you know its going to be good.
Moviegoers outstanding news...God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 5:8  Please believe and repent of you sin today dont be left behind.
Just let the show end please god.
look it as fun as it may seen it means they wouldn't let the show die, meaning its almost destined to get worse
Lest go
Glad to hear John DiMaggio back as Bender. As he should!
I’m gonna say bender isgonna talk about him being in the Simpson?
Every time that familiar theme comes on the nostalgia whiplash comes right along with it. Let’s go Futurama!
While the Simpsons never dies, Futurama just hibernates
Covid and NFT jokes in 2023? Yeah, I'm out. Leave the timely humour to South Park
Hulu
Jesus Christ. Don’t be like the DNC and Biden. Let this show die already.
I have this on my PS2
NEEEEEEEEEEEEEWW SEASOOOOOON BABYYYYYYYYYYYY
Finally!!! Fkn Rodríguez is the best… I can’t wait
The amount of humor in this trailer made me laugh so hard that I can’t wait for the show to come out.
Thank you Hulu, but why only 20? 😭😅😅
This is the good news I needed - amazing show
Beautiful.
Tbh the trailer doesn't really feel like Futurama. Hope they're good.
I want to be excited. I really do. But idk. Better be a blu ray release or ill probably never see it
Hopefully this inspires a renaissance of Leela hentai ❤
*wow i remember watching the last ep on comedy central.*
Hmm on the one hand I love Futurama but on the other I'm happy with the ending it had.
Obey Hypnotoad
Can't wait until they cancel this again after a season and a half. At least I'll enjoy the ride
Canadian Disney+ is gonna get this. No need to worry about paying for a multi-subscription plan.
Ah great. Crypto jokes, along with ones about corona. stuff that's definitely still funny and relevant. Right guys?
Billy West has a frog in his throat. Still, really looking forward to this. We're back, baby!!!
If it takes forever  I will wait for you…
Thank lord and jesus for making these last few years finally seem to have purpose. We needed to have such shittiness, to bring such light. In benders name we pray. Amen 🙏
Please bring back Fugget About It as well
Whoever manifested them bringing Futurama back: thank you 👽💋
FFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU***********************YYYYYYEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAHHHH
WHOOP WHOOP WHOOP WHOOP WHOOP ( V ) (O,,,,O) ( V ) It's back baby!
Boooooooo  The show ended perfectly
I think Bender would make a good thrid wheel for an occasional Rick n Morty team up
The Futurama is here.
In a time of the worst media/hollywood shows and movies ever... Futurama returns to save us.
I really hope third time’s the charm doesn’t fulfill
Why? It was left off at a good place.
The only show I ever get exited to see do "come backs" and only because it always delivers.
cool
I am both surprised and not surprised
I'll watch it, but Futurama has a high bar to clear. "Luck of the Fryrish" is one of the great all time episodes in television history. No qualifier.
YESS now there’s a reason to rerun again! 😭
Covid? Crypto? Great, it's gonna be a season full of dated references like the eyephone and Susan Boyle episode isn't it?
woot my favorite show back at it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can’t wait for the johnny2cellos breakdown
NO WAYYYYYYYYYYY LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 😁😁😁😁😁
It's back, baybee!
i have absolutely no hope but might as well watch it
LOVED the burro(w) joke.
They haven't changed a SINGLE thing, we're back, baby!
This either going to be good or terrible no in-between.
Boy.....
It makes sense with how the series ended
Let's go already!!!
Please keep the cool science jokes coming and stuff love it
OMG. Yes!!!!
i really hope its the same producers, futurama was great because those guys were actually pretty smart and nerdy
I am so happy to see this coming back!!! <3!!
Looking forward to it. Just please don't go woke, that's all I ask...
a thousand summers... I wiiilllllll wait for uuu
i cant wait to pirate th- i mean watch this with my premium (but still has ads) HULU SUPSCRIPTION! WOOO!
The show that just refuses to die. 😂
How many times has this show ended now? I thought the last finale was already perfect
Futurama too good to end, apparently.
hadnt come out yet and the jokes are alredy dated
Futurama Season 12 | Official Trailer | New Season July 22 | Hulu 🙂
I love Futurama, and I'm glad there is more. I am a little worried that they might change the humor and just divulge into endless references to other media and things but I'm willing to go in with an open mind. Edit: Futurama just announced a Fortnite colab, oh god
Where can people OUTSIDE of America watch it? We can't get Hulu???
So beyond jazzed for this to come back!!!!! 🥳
OMG IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING RIGHT NOW 🥲
H1JOS DE 9U7A
My big sausage has raise up to see bendy sexy body 😘
Si tan solo Hulu estuviera disponible también en Latinoamérica
Simpsons is the show that never ends, and futurama is the show that's constantly ending. Can't wait for round 4!
Wow they actually did way better with replacing benders voice than I ever imagined they could.
Nice the big 3 are back
No way!!!!
That's cool. Now I just gotta wait until it shows up for free on TV or something. Buncha shows that made comebacks I'm also waiting for.
YES!!!!  THIS IS LIKE AWESOME BLOSSOM!
man i love futurama but i felt like it had a good ending as it was.
Soooo glad they didn’t ruin the voices   The new squidbillies has become unwatchable
i'm glad it still looks like the original series
Omg like dude they left off on a perfect season final after 2 other finals, just let it rest but I can't front im hyped to hear the old voice cast again
HOLY MOLY!!!
And you thought The Simpsons refused to die.
When I was a kid I didn't had cable to watch it, now I'm catching up to it on  star+, glad to know I have something to look forward to 🤩
Looks like it’ll suffer from the same problem as the Comedy Central season: too focused on “satirizing” current events instead of science fiction tropes. Not looking good.
A series comeback I’m actually looking forward to!
❤❤❤
Yes!
Oh no
Rick and Morty's biggest enemy
This is fantastic
I just hope they give it a good treatment not the Disenchantment BS
I GOTTA PRACTICE MY STABBING! You know to get ready for the new season...
I hope this is good. I was massively disappointed after Animaniacs
HUH??????!
FINALLY
Really REALLY feel unneeded despite how loved the series is !
10 bucks, the quality's gonna drop again.
Some of these jokes look like they're going to painfully dated
why is this not in disney +
THANK YOU, HULU! Best bday present ever. How about you top it with another season next year 😏💚💚
Good news!! Everyone!
My favourite line is when Bender is trying to steal from the DonBot. "Hey, you trying to steal from the Don-Bot". "I'm trying but he's not making it easy."
I believe a "Shut up and take my money!" is in order.
REMEMBER ME!!!!!        🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥    REMEMBER ME!!!!
Revivals going have a few rough episodes before they can find there place usually it's the mid way of seasons it gets good hopefully the revival going to be great
Bruhhhhhh
ew hulu
Thank you for blessing us with this gift! 🥹
can't wait
I still remember the episode where frys dog waits for him to come back.😢😥 One of the sadest episodes ever 💔
Futurama always felt like a show ahead of it's own time. Maybe now, the world is dystopian enough to truly appreciate this masterpiece by what it is. Maybe that's the feeling of the creators too, since Futurama has never been a cash cow for any of it's former owners. Bringing it back only for a few bucks doesn't seem that reasonable.
One of my favorite shows of all time but I’m honestly not looking forward to the Covid jokes & cryptocurrency jokes & NFT jokes. It’s a bit late for all that stuff.
I pray for another the simpsons futurama crossover
Meh
YESSSS
Let it die peacefully, stop ruining old shows.
Good News Everyone ! 😂
I mean the Show ended on a perfect ending with the final episode but I always loved the show for its characters, world building and intergalactic mayhem. I can’t wait for more Futurama.
I take it that it will just ignore the last episode then?
I'm normally not a fan of reboots but I can't even lie, I'm excited.
I said this twice before and will say it again. This should of never been cancelled. Cannot wait
Please don't make it woke 🙏
the second comeback is always better than the first one ;-)
Finally something to save us from disenchantment’s aimless boring missed potential. Not just hating for no reason, I just got tired of the long pauses and lack of foley in that show. They should’ve leaned more into making them more episodic rather than a full on overarching story.
after all this years and I've never thought I needed to see Mama slapping the crew
It's back babyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, but honestly, part of me feels like it shouldn't be.
Ooooooh! I'm so happy for Futurama to return! I'm always happy to see our favorite characters again especially Bender!😁🤖
Wait didnt this show end?
YEAAAAA
Nah this a Big W
in futurama, I remember it was a cliffhanger to a new beginning of Fry and Leela’s relationship. The two finally get married and live a life together until their old days in a different timeline. in episode 140 does Fry and Leela’s love story will restart after going thorough the portal following the Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth or reset everything back to the first episode?!?
Great a covid themed episode 🙄
THANK GOD ITS NOT WOKE!!! THANK GOOOOOOOD THEY DIDN'T GO WOKE!!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭 SAME OLD COMEDY, ALL NEW EPISODES!! I CANNOT WAIT!!!   I rewatched this so much when I had cancer. To see it come back is absolutely amazing.
I will never forgive them for recasting Bemdar.
Bender said it best “We’re Back Baby” so we can’t wait
This looks horrible..
“We’re back baby” put such a smile on my face
This show just doesn't die.
>le "topical" crypto and covid jokes  Cautiously optimistic but a LOT of revivals have been fumbled lately. This one's got a lot to prove.
Given how things have been with sudden "continuations" of shows. I hope this isn't a trash fire. Because it's not hard to make a trailer that misleads what it's actually like.
Seems pretty faithful
I'm so excited, but something seems off about the animation. Almost like it is fan made animation. That doesn't mean it's bad in any sense. It just seems unusual to me. Different animation studio from the original, perhaps?  Also, you can really hear the age in Billy West's voice. It's a part of life, but still makes me a tad bit sad.
My favorite show ever is back! So happy!
Not sure how i feel about this. The original series ending was perfect
Wait wait a good reboot? Not a velma or clone hight s2, so happy
Shut up and take my Money!
Yes! Fry and Leela are still together. I  just wanted to know that 😊
You can't let the greatest ending to a TV show stay in place?
Welcome back planet express!
That's going to be the best birthday present ever
Man, who else is super pumped for this?! Glad it's coming back, also can we talk about Explovid-23. 😂🤣
can't wait to pirate this
It’s the comeback of the century!!!
So why did end anyway ?
Best show ever
❤
shutup and take my money!
This will either be extremely good or extremely bad. To quote the show itself: So far .... I HAVE NO STRONG FEELINGS ONE WAY OR THE OTHER!
The COVID stuff is so lame. Everyone’s done it and it’s so played out at this point.
Not today depression not TODAY 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Bender's voice gave me a rush
I'm so happy rn, great show!
Yay
I’m both excited and scared
this looks like it might be ok but...nowadays everything sucks so best not to get our hopes up.
We're back baby!
WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF TOMORROW!
I can't wait to see the cryogenic heads of today's celebrities.
Back To The Futurama!!!
YES!!!
Excuse me what
I’m conflicted, I’m glad they’re bringing back the show but at the same time, I like how it ended.
First we get a fnaf dlc trailer, only murders in the building is right around the corner,solar opposites season 4 is happening. AND WE GET A NEW SEASON OF FUTURAMA WHATTTTT.
I sure hope no dog dies in this show again.
Looks terrible from this preview. I hope it's good.
This show is immortal and always will be.
Looks not funny
This is the show that will not die.  I'm thankful for that.
They better not ruin this show.
YES!  Please be good.
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
"good news every one. We are no longer cancelled, except you zoidberg, you can leave"
Can't wait to see what the creators of "eye-pod" and "Susan boil" have to say about Covid19 and crypto
No
Woohoo!
WOOOOOOHOOOOOOOO IT’S BACK BABY
I just finished watching the first 5 seasons, weird but acceptable timing
Aw shiet, here we go again
This is it's 3rd revival
Shutup and take my money..
At first i didnt believe that Futerama was coming back after all these years but i am happy that i was wrong! so lets GO! ANOTHER SEASON!
It looks good but hearing the Word crypto country scares me.
Futurama was one of my childhood series, and its in my heart to this day as one of the best shows ive ever seen, if not the best. Watching Fry tirelessly trying to win Leela's heart was touching. Im an adult now and it brings me all types of happy feelings seeing them again today, finally as a couple.
Love John DiMaggio
Literally the best show. Should've never been canceled in the first place.
I know Futurama is just a knock off Simpsons
I was worried if I'd like it, then bender punched a cop in the stomach for no reason, and I knew I had nothing to worry about.
The one subscription service I don't have. Well it looks just as funny as before. Let's see how long it last this time before another cancelation
There are no new ideas.
wow nice!
I could cry
The last episode was an incredible ending but I’m also happy to see its back!
Hot take, I don’t think they should bring back futurama. It ended perfectly, don’t ruin it.
Hulu you are my hero
Some of these characters were never funny and it’s a shame they’re bringing them back
I love the show but it's been canceled what, three times? I'm hoping for at least 4 more seasons.
Finally it is return
I hope they keep the show going for a long while
Crypto and covid? Lame!
WOOT, WOOT!!!!  Can’t wait for this one to be back baby!!!!!!
I didn´t plan to watch this new season. When I heard there will be no Bender, I just didn´t look for news.  But this looks AWESOME and I´m totally in!
Can't wait for this to be part of the inevitable Disney+/Hulu merger
I'm cautiously optimistic about this.
I love it already
I hope this doesn't get the woke treatment 😶‍🌫️
I know it was a very short clip but nibbler's voice sounded off and now i wonder if Frank welker didn't return.
Cerveza, por favor!
This makes me very happy but it does make me a bit worried The plots and jokes seem to be very topical Futurama always did it’s own thing while subtlety taking jabs at real world events but here they seem just in your face especially the Covid and Covid test jokes Still I’m cautiously optimistic
The Best 😊of Matt's shows.
LET'S GOGGOGOGOGOGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Футурама 😍🤩😍
Can't believe this got cancelled while Simpsons has been running all these years
"canceled by idiots, then brought back by BIGGER idiots"
Parts of the animation look really cheap but I really hope the writing is good, the voice actors have no complains from me.
I have a bon3r
I’m cautiously optimistic, I love this show! But I feel like so many shows and movies are brought back just to be destroyed
YES YES YES. A MILLION TIMES YES.
I’m so excited this show is back!! 🥺🙌🏾💕💕💕
Bro this looks like cheeks
NOOOOO LET IT END PLEASE the reason why some shows are glorious is because they have an ending please dont let this turn into a Simpsons or a family guy 😭
Good news, everyone!
I remembered when Futurama ended its second run in 2013
When july 1st hits im going to binge watch all of futurama to be ready for the new season. This and king of the hill also making a comeback is freaking sweet.
I feel like I'm back in high school, waiting for Futurama to come on Adult Swim.
Zombie show!!! Zombie show!!! ZOMBIE!!!!
Welp looks like I have to get Hulu now
Not a fan of all of the topical episodes…
Thank you
This is how you know we are living in the best timeline.
Don't be too hype over this. I can the red flags from here. It's good to let something die. Everything dies eventually. Keeping something alive artificially just wears it down. And it's undoubtedly going to be changed from the original.
LET’S GOOOOOOOOO (already)!!!
Now King of the Hill please
Well. That is very welcomed
“Let’s gooo alreadyyyyyyy!”
As long as it's more original than the last season should be fine, which shouldn't be hard at all.
So glad to hear Billy West is working
i don’t like that a show ab the future is trying to be topical
Jesus Christ just let the show die
Wow look at all those current day parallels and callbacks to earlier seasons. I think this is shaping up to be a very middling comeback ❤
My favorite show of all time, back and better than ever!
Hot diggity daffodil.
I LOVE IT! but i must admit, the 0:19 lipsync or animation bothers me... is it just me?
This show got canceled and brought back so many times its ridiculous
Hope this isn't another failed revival by Hulu. I really love Futurama
Hopefully they won’t get rid of the old seasons like they did with the Animaniacs
Unlike Indiana Jones, this is the return we are all happy about.
"no ones ever really gone"
THEY'RE BACK BABY!
It never really felt like the original shows' themes were specifically from the 00s, but this definitely feels like something from the 20s.
I love futurama and it's great to get more and all, but can't shows just end? I was pretty happy with how the show finished off, and I don't neccesarily think we need more
Flaties Unite!
I am So Dang Happy!!!!
I didn’t know it was coming back
I mean, is this actually good news? I love the show but bro, sometimes ypu might have to let things rest man.
meh, it ended so well, did it really need another season? plus covid and crypto jokes seem.......too late. not exactly topical
YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES!
How did Bender get back to the future after being stuck in The Simpsons’ timeline?
just let the series rest already
I really do like how it literally does just look like a new season dropped without any changes
We get the FNaF movie trailer and this in the same day? Wow
1:14 he so hot😂
They are bringing back the one show that should never have died, while shows like Simpsons and Family Guy just exist because they do.
My favorite show
wait WHAT???? HOWWW????
So happy to see this show coming back!
This is my favorable antidepressant . 😍😍😍😍😍
Just like "The Simpsons", this too will tackle the pandemic in an amazing way!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ah yea jokes about covid and crypto they’ve shot themselves in the foot already 😅
Ok when's the season after next?
Is this set after the series finale?
I hope they rip the s*** out of NFTs. I can only imagine what these mad geniuses can come up with on that little topic
Ah man, and just when i was about to cancel you Hulu, you BRING ME BACK IN!
Whaaaat
GOOD NEWS EVERYONE!
This looks really stilted
Finally!!!!!!!
Even though I loved the ending im excited
Take notes clone high this is how you do a revival
The most enduring show on television.
I hope Ben returns
And so it begins
So are Fry and Leela still married or…?
Love Futurama, so happy to see it’s back
He is back! Baby
yessssssssssssirrrrrrrrrr
I can't wait!!!
We're back baby!
Manscape me Kiff, that’s a order. WE’RE SO BACK!
Cant wait for this!
Its  gone be fun on the bun 😂
Yesssssssssssss I’m so excited
why
Yeaaaahhhh omg yes
i missed this show
Yeah wow, really wish they hadn't shown a dog being eaten for no reason
YES VERY YESQASSZSDSADSADSADSADFSDFSEFSGRS S EGGRS
WE'RE BACK BABY
The Hulu logo looks like a annoyed person.😂
1:33 that is some sick logo animation 🔥 . Great to see Futurama Back!
Man, Hulu sure does love shows that reference being on Hulu. Is it, like, part of their seasonal contract to mention being on Hulu at some point?
oh boy covid jokes how timely!
No f ing way 🤯
Beautiful
That must have been Flexo who was kicked by the donkey, because bender would never admit he deserves punishment.
Ain’t nobody asked for this
No Hulu in my region.😢
THANK GOD FRY AND LEELA ARE STILL TOGETHER
Sweet! I feel that Futurama on Hulu is fitting given the fact that Disney now owns rights to the series.
Good news everyone!
0:47 Not gonna lie Fry looked pretty badass there for a second.
But the series finale was so good
Can't wait to watch in the uk... oh wait
RIP futurama
😃😁😊🥹🫂🥳💥😂👌🎉...yes!!!!
I did not see this comming
I'M SO READY!!!! EVERYONE MUST WATCH THIS SO IT DOESN'T GET CANNCELLED FOR THE 4th, 5th? TIME!
lit
We've had like 4 good finales for this show. They should've just done like a special or sumn
I really hope that it's not all covid, crypto, and alexa jokes. The crypto stuff especially is ALREADY dated.
I wonder if the disruption also altered history?  Meaning that the years since Fry got frozen (2000-2023) is more like real-world history, and the future changed subtly to reflect that.  Though I wonder if some events that were mentioned in the show still happened, like the War of 2012 and the coming of Zombie Jesus.  I hope we get an episode with the Amazonians. 😁
I've got a bad feeling about this
It looks like nothing changed  Sure there's some modern references, but I'm sure it'll be fine
Friends help! A guinea pig tricked me!
"GOOD NEWS EVERYONE!" indeed 🙂
Hearing Frank Welker as Nibbler again🥹🥹🥹
covid and crypto? a little late
yay!!!!
Наконец-то !!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
Hello 5 hour gang But really this is cool!
I'm so happy they are bringing Futurama back
Oh boy i cant wait i remember watching this on syfy
Woooo!! 😵‍💫🐸
Futurama it just wouldn’t stay dead
shut up and take my money, etc.
AHHHHHHHHH IM SO STOKED!!!!!
"From the creator of the Simpsons"... I dont think that was even necessary lol
🎉🎉🎉 Now this is resurrection! I missed them much.
I prey for it to not turn woke
Heh, the future is now
The first four or five seasons of Futurama were classic, the specials were alright, the later seasons on Comedy Central ranged from okay to meh, I don't know how this season will turn out but I'm just hoping it's okay at best.
Were back baby!
Actually looks pretty good, animation is a bit more automated looking and zoudbergs voices change a tad but everything else I'm excited for
Thank god it’s not Disney that’s making it
I cannot believe this is real ❤
At this point, Futurama will also live 1000 years into the future.
I can't tell if this is real. I've had my hopes crushed for years that I'm scared just to think Futurama is coming back... 🙏
I’ve never been so excited
I cannot express my excitement
Yes!!! Wooooo!!! Soo long overdue! I hope they take inspiration from the comics too btw
No hint of wokeness either.  I'm happy to see the show return.
still one of the best shows to watch. no woke ideology etc. katey segal a true strong female actor
0:42  that’s exactly how sticking that thing up my nose felt.
GOOD NEWS EVERYONE!
THE WORMS RETURN!
They picked up right where it left off... Madlads!  So excited for this!!!
The show didn’t end it just got frozen.
im hypeeeee
There’s no way my favorite show is coming back! Let’s goooo
Finally a reason to live
Thanks Futurama, very cool.
The perfect set up  Air some seasons  Cancel it  Air some more seasons  Cancel it  Air some more seasons  Cancel it   It never gets old because it doesn’t have the chance too
from fox, to comedy central, to hulu, don't call it a comeback!
Super keen!
Oh my God it's back! :D
What a birthday present to look forward too 🎉👌🏻
It seems tired tbh
You’re just as beautiful as the day I lost you.
Didn't Calculon died?
Bring it on!
Same as The Animaniacs right? Dated, meta jokes? It was okay. Futurama was doing that already with the previous reboot. Maybe I'll enjoy this one more.
LETSS GOOO
This will fill the Rick and Morty shaped hole
It's not that it's tackling current events, it just feels...late
What a great time to be alive
Jesus christ this really just looks and feels like a lost futurama season or something The dialog is on point snd the animation looks like it was ripped right out of the original. I can really tell that the team wanted to get back on the show after so long. Great work!
John Dimaggio was about to do Just transformers this year and not this
IT JUST WON'T STAY DEAD!  Nah, I'm legit excited.
its about time
I started watching Futurama this April and I had binged it all by May, now I can’t wait for this all new season! When I started watching it this year I didn’t even know there were plans to release a new season until late May so it’s great that I haven’t been waiting for this for years like the rest of you hardcore day one fans 😂
Seems more topical than previous seasons.
Great ... now I need to pay for a Hulu account.
aaaaAAAAAAA OMGG IT'S REAL IT'S COMING
YOU MEMBA FUTURE RAMA? I MEMBER FUTURE RAMA!
Glad to see Futurama is continuing the tradition of lampooning pop culture that's three years old.
Thank you God.
Where king of the hill
Man,so many references to things happening in 2020...and also,the machine listening ...
The burro joke was such a futurama joke
Futurama will never die y’all it’s been cancelled so many times I lost count and I love it lol
Yessir
I don’t know
Omg it's finally happening... They are back! Thanks Hulu for bring back my favorite show again! In your face Rick and Morty 😜
Season 1-4 will always be the best for me. Every season after that were mostly  "lol so random" and it felt like the writers thought the audience had ADD so they couldn't let a moment breathe. Don't expect this one will be different, but I'll give it a shot
GOOD NEWS!
WERE BACK BABY
The fact that this show keeps getting canceled and coming back while The Simpsons has endured for 30 plus years uninterrupted is proof that we really are living in one of Humanity's darkest possible timelines.
If Futurama can come back for the fourth time, maybe there’s hope for Inside Job.
They better remember that this show is at least 70% irony.
The hype is real!!¡!
FUTURAMA NEVER DIES!!!!!
Welcome back gang, let's show The Simpsons how to end with dignity!
I'm always excited to see Futurama making another comeback excited to see it on Hulu
Someone unthawed the series from CryoSleep. I mean, uh, _Welcome to the Woooorld of Tomorrow, Futurama!_
Eh
...So the finale never happened?
I'm back baybae!!!!
MORBO DEMANDS YOU WATCH THIS NEW SEASON OR I SHALL DESTROY YOU ALL!... And now for our sponsors.
Still funny....unlike the Simpsons
Futurama is one of the best animated shows of all time, full stop.  Cannot WAIT for more of it!!
Just let shows die
Thanks, I hate it.
*Yayyy*
I will probably subscribe to hulu only because of that
Looks good
OMG! HOLLYWOOD LET SOME STUFF DIE! HOW MANY TIMES DID THEY DRAG THIS CORPSE OUT THE FREAKIN GRAVE!
more of a Hulu ad than Futurama lol
Those episodes were great
Well I hope it is still as (hidden) intellectual and scientiffic as it was.
Yes please…… I mean yeah so creepy.
I swear this show ended like four times
I thought they wrapped this show up years ago?
The worms are back?! Love it. No notes
THE WORMS ARE BACK
My family has been rewatching this show for years!
There is a slim chance this might be actually good.  But given the already good ending it had, and the fact this feels like beating a corpse to get a few more squeaks out of it or something? I don't have much hope.
I just hope Fry and Leela will stay a couple and not have an "on again off again" relationship... again.
WE'RE BACK BABY
My brain has officially exploded.
I hope its good, i really do.
Awesome, look forward to it
The professor scratching his brain with the Q-Tip. Glad to know Futurama has still got it.
Oh man I can't wait
Creativity is officially dead
I hope  Disney didnt't scrubfy it like they did the Simpsons and family guy
yes yes yes yes yes yes keep it going hulu dont cancel it
Lol my adulthood is complete!
Bender voice: "I'm back baby!" o/ shoutout from a Hulu dev
HOORAY!
Will it available to watch in the UK and where
New animation killed Simpsons and family guys look and looks like it happened to Futurama too 😢
I don't want to get hyped, this his looks very promising. So no more trailers for me guys, see you whenever this is available in Europe.
This is one of those shows that I rewatch every year or 18 months or so. It's good to see them make a comeback. Hopefully they keep the same humor.
From Fox, to Adult Swim, to Comedy Central, to Hulu. I love this show!
This honestly feels like the old show which is great!!!  A lot of reboots happen and they’re just abominations… but futurama never lets us down!
Wish they at least updated the style. It just looks exactly like it did decades ago.
Just finished the last episode a month ago. So happy there’s more!❤
All the jokes in the trailer are kinda dumb. Which probably means the show will be dumber. My expectations were raised and smashed in just under 2 minutes.
Here before valiskibum makes a video about this
covid jokes..crypto jokes...oh boy...
This looks awesome
I’m excited for it.
Just let it end...
My dog passed away this year and I coped with watching Futurama,  (Except the dog-episode, I skipped that ofc) so this is a more than a welcoming surprise for me!
This should not exist. The ending of the series was up there with the best endings for a series I've seen, and it will always be the end of the series to me, even though they seem to resurrecting it for money. Needless to say, I'm not gone be watching this
i hope the show doesn't go WOKE
Eh, Futurama trying to be topical rarely works. Remember the 2012 election episode?
Hypeeeee!!!!
Glad to see this show back up and running again. ❤
Futurama is incredible and somehow still underrated
Really? A covid episode? Lame
Shout out to Katey Segal nobody else can voice Leela
OH MY GOD IM SO EXCITED
Futurama worst episodes are better than the best episodes of other animated series. Now bring on the flapjack and hookers baby!
This show prided itself on being expertly written by physicists and mathematicians to make intelligent jokes and intriguing sci-fy storylines. This trailer however, it depicts mostly cheap slap-stick comedy that played a big part in the downfall of The Simpsons. I hope this isn't a cash-grab and they put actual effort into these scripts. PLEASE!
AAAAAAA
Thank you. Always liked FUTURAMA better than The Simpsons.
STOP BRINGING IT BACK. ITS OVER. ITS DONE. PLEASE STOP. 4 DIFFERENT NETWORKS. ITS OVER GO HOME. MATT YOU HAVE THE SIMPSONS, YOUR GOOD.
Seriously... COVID parody?? That's so last year 😐😑
Weird to think Fry is voiced by a 71 y/o
This show has the most funniest way to return.
Good news everyone
dead show xd
only 50 seconds in and heard covid and crypto this is a sad day for futurama would of been better if the show stayed dead
I can't wait for this to be cancelled after 3 seasons and brought back on... Let's say... Adult Swim.
It's gonna be fun on a bun!
SCULLLLLLYYYYYY
LETS GO ALREADAY!!!
Oh no, please not Covid references.
I’d pick a new season of Futurama over a new season of Family Guy any day
At last more rule34 leela!
Just let it die.
REALLY?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? OH! MY! GOD!!!! So excited and hyped!!!! Futurama is the perfect example of the show which become better season after season. And the first full length movie? A masterpiece!!! So glad and so hyped for more futurama!!!!
Yes............just yes.
Nuh uh 😮
I’m here bro. I can remember when futurama first aired.  I was like 7 so I didn’t get some of the jokes but I thought “robot was funny” and loved it
So now they gonna butcher even futurama... Fucken Juden of Groening
I hope Robo-Santa creates mischief and chaos.
oh yeah!
Mom might be planet expresses new boss
Fake news
jesus christ no way
*A classic gem given a new life i can't wait*
Ive been disappointed with so many reboots or modern takes on tv shows i loved. Futurama has been canceled and brought back so manybtimes i hope this succeeds where others have failed recently
LETS GOOOO MORE BENDERRRR
2023 beat for games and media
I did not know what my life was missing until just right now.
I'm most impressed with is the fact they modernized yet still nailed the old feel of the style without making it overly obvious.
Futurama, Simpsons, and South Park were the pinnacle of American tv animation. Family Guy was great but these 3 were always next level.
I think 3rd time’s a charm. Hulu will allow it to be free and do what it couldn’t at Fox and CC.
The only episode I ever saw was the one with the time machine.
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
I'm glad it's back. I would love to see a crossover with Doraemon where it will have the adventures of Nobita, Fry, Bender, Shizuka, and Leela in both the Japanese and English versions.
This show just can't be killed
Why didn’t they just leave it be
I just finished watching this show for the first time and was wishing there was more - I can’t believe they’re rebooting it!!! So excited!!
They’re back baby!
When this new season airs a Futurama will officially be older than the Simpsons was when Futurama began
👀👀👀👀👀👀
While Im glad West is back as Fry, Farnsworth, and Zoidberg, I do feel rather sad for him. You can hear him struggle at times.
Yep 😂😂
You win Hulu.
It hasn’t changed in a thousand and ten years 🙂
They arrived a bit late to the party with the Crypto part
Hulu is the best and I’ve known that for years but I’ll die knowing that as the truth
Futurama is immortal !!
Good news everyone!
It’s amazing that the trailer just feels like Normal, same old Futurama. Let’s hope the rest of the season retains that same charm.
I haves watched every episode nearly 4 times over.   Watching this has brought back so many memories. Man I’m excited
make the heads able to get out their jars and hop around on their necks
Yeah, the new voices sounds off
waittt omgg
I really hope they don't get divorced. The last series "finale" was heartwarming. Please don't destroy it.
Yikes
We already had the perfect ending
Best news of 2023.
Omg let's gooooo
The original airing was so good. Can't say the same about the newer stuff.
It’s backkkkkkkk
My highschool teacher used to help work on the Simpsons and Futurama
please be good
The 3D animation looks so good!!!! I can't wait!!
Oh my god please be good
I am prepared for the lowest ratings yet, but I hope it doesn't go that way.
it does legit seem very similar to the comedy central run. Which is good, cus that wasnt a bad run
...WHAT
The show will be cancelled 3 times before the first season ends.
Animation seems kinda iffy, I hope thats just something they will iron out by then cause I love this show!
Thank you so much Hulu. May you eventually become the universal streaming platform
Futurama is my favorite cartoon TV show. I feel it's like Star Trek, even when it's bad, it's still good. Hopefully the HULU season brings back their A-Game
I can't wait for the new season.
I think it's been around long enough to say from the creator of Futurama.
woohoo :)
I can't wait to watch this show then be disappointed when its prematurely canceled. WooHoo! We love streaming services here, don't we folks?
Oh... your... god !
LETS GOOOOOOO!!!!
Something seems off.  There's something making me hesitate here.
Why couldn’t they just let my favorite show die in peace
Im sure this won't be more then one but yea
Grinning from ear to ear at this
I hope this will be good but i have a gut feeling its gonna be a flop. Everything Disney has acquired and rebooted has been terrible.
we're back baby
Hank of hill ready
Самые лучшие новости за последние время.
I’m so glad there back I used to love this show as a kid and I’m so glad I can watch it again as an adult 🔥💯
Let's gooooo
0:54 Leela as Arthur Morgan? Sold
I'm so excited to see my favorite show come back again!!
Theres no hulu in Australia is jt going to be available anywhere here??
This is gonna be out of this world. 🚀
Oh boy, ooohh boooyyy!
anyone know if John Goodman will be back as Robot Santa, or if it'll be DiMaggio?
Its great that they have the original voice actors back in it
Can’t wait to watch review channels complain for no reason :D
I’ve always wanted to hear Farnsworth say "Breaking news, everyone!" like a news reporter. Hopefully, it’ll finally happen!
Welcome back to life Futurama. You have been missed.
We’re back!
We better get hella seasons
Wow, this looks weird something seems off...
First FNAF trailer now a new season of FUTURAMA?!!!!
Where is Hit Monkey season 2?
My favorite show of all time is being dug up from the grave to spew more covid nonsense and who knows what else embarrassing. The show had a cyclical ending, now ruined by corporate greed.
And they’re keeping it exactly the same💙
It's sad though because the ending was so sweet
Hope this one will be good
I think we should we cancel it again so that it can be revived again. It'll become a yearly ritual. After many centuries, it will become a part of everyday life for future generations. No one will remember why Futurama must be canceled only to get renewed again after that, but it will continue to happen without fail.
Hot Hot Hot
Neat!
Futurama ended perfectly. I am so afraid this is going to turn out another horrible reboot, and the amount of 'relevant' references makes me very skeptical. Still, I had goosebumps. Don't do us like this...
I'm so happy \o/
WERE BACK BABY!
wait there back... . . . . .. xD sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet
I can't wait :D I really love this show
Bro why are they rebooting this again
It's gonna be fun on a bun!
Pandemic and Crypto jokes? I am sure glad they arent doing thing horribly outdated
I’m so excited for this! Getting Hulu now
loved watching this show as a kid. It was hilarious but had some really sad moments as well .
Oh man I am going crazy! Rest in Peace, Phil Hartman.
Please don't ruin this hulu, please don't play with my heart. Btw can't wait for the covid episode 😁😷
Who knows how long this’ll last, and how well the animators get treated for it.
Looks good but im not sure about the covid and crypto stuff
i can't wait for the writers to put us through an emotional roller coasters with the original seasons
No way
Here we go again...
yesssssssssssssssss
Is this gonna be on Disney+ too?
Bro I just finished the show glad we got more episodes
“It just won’t stay dead”
Why did this take so long. Had to happen eventually
It looks like it's a lot of fun The only thing I was disappointed about was the obvious covid joke, when those are so done...
i honestly dk how to feel cause the ending of the last season was a perfect moment to stop at
Oh Lord please let this be a good comeback not a bad one 🙏🙏
Finally the thing I been waiting for a long time.
Hulu? Here in México its Star+ 🤠😅
Yay,🥳
This makes me happy.
Oh thank god. A reason to keep going. 😊  It's been too long old friend.
Finally some good f@ckin food
Wooooooooooo!
Hesitantly optimistic
Jokes brought to you by ChatGPT
Some things will end....just for them to start back up like nothing ever happened
I could not be happier that Futurama is coming back. Loved this show since it first came out.
Yaaaaaaayyyyyyy!
let it die jesus
They went to a new network with blackjack and hookers ...wait no blackjack oh well 🤷
Happy to see my favorite show make a come back!
On one hand New Futurama, but on the other the ruined a beautifully ending
Rip zap 😔
MAN 10 years already!
I was laughing through this whole trailer. Absolutely can’t wait for the return of this show. It’s amazing the amount of times it keeps getting cancelled and then comes back again. Some things just stick around forever.
Hateful anti conservative propaganda.  “Jokes” when political are only anti conservative and are not even accurate satire
I found out about it in the last season, at a friends house and knew I'd like it. But I watched it so many times that end up loving it more than I knew I would, and it never got old. And after a decade, of watching it, it is the biggest deal of a show coming back to me in my life. because when I can't stand to watch anything, it's all I can watch. Linda?
YES! YES! YASSSSSSSSS!!!!!!
Good news everyone Futurama has returned
A new season ! Yay :3
I really hope there's not too many topical jokes. I cringed at the Covid and crypto references
They're back ? ... no idea who they're ... I'd be better off opening my own place with blackjacks and hookers ...nah ... forget abt the blackjacks.
Yey !!  😃
I bit on the nose with the episodes and episode titles (released a few weeks ago), but I hope this season is as good as... the first four* seasons.  *the movies were considered season 4 or whatever
Yessssh!!!!!!!!!!!!
I bet they will ruin it with political correctness
666k views in just 3 hours! Way to go Futurama!
Shut up baby I know it!
Welcome to the 2020s, where everything is the same as before but worse
Finally good tv.
and a week after my 21st birthday let’s go
Me is the happy
jeje Fry is a flatty
"From the people who brought you Futurama" 💀
I can’t believe it.. This feels so surreal.
Is THAT JOHN DIMAGGIO?!
I love this show so much and I’m so happy it’s back.
It looks a little rough but I trust it’s gonna be phenomenal
Soooo😂
Lets go alreeeeeaaaaaadyyyyyyyy!!!!!
Looks horrible, way to many modern references
BSJJSBABAHHABSNDKFBSNJANSBDNJSJDBDBSNJSJDJDBDJSNKAKFNDKBSVANRNIEHWGQBDMJCOABANNodnnqbdysundjhJHHDNJDJFNTBYDJDNFMKCJDJAMNEORKFBDNS
Wow
The ending was perfect though. Eh whatever. If it has good clips I'll watch it.
I’m glad that the whole OG cast is back 🙌🏾
This shows promise. I R happy
HYPE HYPE
I've lost count the number of times this show got cancelled.
My childhood is back
So it looks like its going to be everything I hated about the comedy central episodes...  Everyone is going to be a parody of themselves and their going to do episodes about "real events" like Obama and Iphones again.  Only now its going to be about Crypto and Covid YEARS after they should've even thought of doing that...
Definitely going to be worse than the Comedy Central seasons.
Fry and starlord give off the same vibe😂
I wonder if Richard Nixon head is still president
Explovid-23 boy I wonder what that’s a reference to. Man, 2020 was the year of all time.
Wanna go around again
I'm worried that the trailer is light on jokes, but hoping its actually a good show.
Look at my favorite show that was watched since 2001 and rewatched 47 times being all nice and cozy.  Parasites are back, baby!
july is the goat month for shows and movies
I hope they give Leela and Fry some kids.
Ya know what's funny? John DiMaggio said he wouldn't come back unless the original voice actors were given alot more money. Then a little later he announced his participation. If that's not the most in character thing for Bender idk what is.
LETSSS GOOOOOO
Its been two yrs in the making for this season and i feel joh
I’m so happy I can’t wait yesssssssss
i am having a heart attack
Last time I heard these characters my parents were alive. I was much younger. it feels like getting back an old friend
YEEEEEES
I can't wait til this comes out bro I've kept watching reruns 😂😭😭✊🏾💪🏾this show is funny asf nbs
This show has dodged death so many times, and its done it again
The animation looks updated, and the jokes are actually still hilarious, YES YES YES!!!...
My favorite show of all time is back!
Looks like they're leaning as hard as possible on topical humor. Like most of the jokes will be like the awful iphone/2012 episodes.
I want it to work, but every attempt since the series initially ended has been mediocre at best. Honestly may have been best to just leave it to the original seasons and the movies.
GOOD NEWS EVERYONE!
Oh, I'm still dreaming. How do I wake up again? I'll try pinching myself.
We're back, baby! -Bender. Again.
Hearing frank and billy again is nice to hear.
Will this be coming out weekly, or will it drop the whole season?
I just hope this thing becomes available in Australia (Disney+ would be nice since Hulu isn't a thing in Australia and since all the old Futurama is on Disney+ here in Oz)
But the ending was so good!! Why bring it back from the dead? Please have people come up with new ideas instead.
im glad there keeping that formula with no changes and seems like they're staying true to fry and Leela's relationship
I've been waiting for this for several years! So excited!!
From the people whom brought you Futurama.  Present... Futurama
Let’s goooooo
why did they even cut this show to begin with? it was pretty great
Alright! Futurama is back! Love it!
Covid and crypto stuff huh
I am cautiously optimistic about this.  The last couple seasons after the last revival weren't bad, but they didn't feel the same.  There just seemed to be something off about them.  The comdey felt a little too fast paced sometimes.  Like they couldn't let a joke breathe, if that makes any sense.  I'm still excited for more Futurama though.  July 24 can't come fast enough.
I’m fine with this can’t wait!
🎉🥳
Thank you for this!
this fells wrong
I am dancing around my house! After watching all 13 seasons over 10 times I am over the moon baby!!!!!!
This makes me very happy
Even the trailer was funny. I’m pretty excited.
I'm excited for this but how many times is Futurama going to be cancelled to be brought back a few years later. Yet Simpson continues til this day and hardly anyone watches it anymore. They should stop canceling and reviving Futurama. Just until the fans get sick of it, which I think the fans never will. Plus I thought meanwhile was the perfect finish but happy to have it back
I'm glad the cast is working again and such but I'm really not looking forward to this. It wasn't the same on the first comeback, it never is.
Woohoo we get to see futurama run so long is gets boring and annoying to watch just like the simpsons! Dry humor coming up!
Finally!
I remember watching every season..then being yelled at for watching it. Good times.
eyyo
they're back!!!!!
They are back baby!
THE WORMS ARE BACK!
Did anybody ask for this? Should be buried with the 90’s. Absolutely no humor found here.
Planet Express crew is back baby!!
Futurama is the kind of series that ends waits a few years for real life to give it ideas and then go back into making
YES
LETS GOOOO ITS BACK
The only thing I find OOC is that Bender is acknowledging he was in the wrong and sayings "I deserved that".
Yes! I was about to walk into a suicide booth, but this means I have at least one seasons worth of life left in me!
The revival seasons where (mostly) bad enough; just let this show die in piece
YESSSSSSSSSS IM CRYING
Whoop whoop
Let things DEAD!!!!
Wow I just started watching futurama and I see this. What a perfect time to binge the series!
There's a reason this show keeps getting revived, and I am there day one.
Stop digging up corpses and let it rest
YES FINALLY!
Well glad everyone happy that Futurama is coming back just hope this reboot is better then the others and sequels because lately the simpsons are that entertaining any more.
NO FEIWHWGVD D WAY
So excited to see this, I love Futurama
I got hit by a car and couldn't walk for over a year. All I had was this DVD. Before streaming lol glad to see it's coming back
But... I thought this wasn't happening cus John or Billy or someone wasn't willing to do it? Don't get me wrong I love Futurama even more than the Simpsons, it's probably my favourite animated series ever, but I do feel like we should probably let it end like what is this the fifth revival?
Awesome, awesome to the max
The only bummer is that i have a feeling this wont be released on DVD in the near future cause of it being a Hulu Exclusive. I hope im wrong though.
Hopefully it won't get tainted by wokeness
There are no words to describe how happy I am. I've always loved Futurama and I wanted it to come back soooooooo bad. And now it's finally here again! And Calculon being back too is the cherry on top of the cake. 👍
I always really liked Futurerama way more then the Simpsons glad to see it back
All the hype so much hype
I have a reason to live now 😊
Futurama was such a blast, and I'm happy for its return but why Hulu? Netflix or Amazon would've been so much better.
They’re back baby🎉🎉
GOOD NEWS EVERYONE!!!
Futurama forever!!!
They actually gave John Dimaggio a raise. I was worried he wouldn't be back to voice Bender...
So the shows basically on a when the writers come up with ideas
let it die
This is my favorite TV show of all time, and I have watched the entire thing at least thirty times; words cannot adequately express what this show means to me, and how much of a comfort show it is.  In my opinion (which has been quite wrong before), this looks FANTASTIC. The only part I could ever complain about with the original (and not a problem of the show, just a factor of any piece of media) is that it was made for adults when I was around grade school/middle school level, leaving some of the jokes to do with things that I wasn't able to pick up on at the time. On subsequent re-watches as I've grown up, I've picked up on almost everything, as the adult/human experience at it's core is pretty universal, but a few things remained lost unless I looked them up, as they were just products of their time. I know some people don't like when shows tackle current-ish events, but when done well I think it's extremely impactful. And now that I'm an adult with a growing list of oh too relatable problems to go with it, I'm excited to see what Futurama has to say about the modern era, I'm excited to watch these two new seasons (hopefully more! Kick that grave up!) 30 times, and I'm just simply excited for more Futurama in general.   They're BACK Baby!
Hoping they got some of the writing crew back as well as some of the writing in modern tv is hot garbage and the comedic writing and characterization is what really set the show apart.
Me too, fry, me too😔  I'M 40% EXCITED!!!...actually more.
Yo Gusta de Los Simpson y Futurama. 🙂
let's go already
Я счастлив!
This doesn't look bad like other reboots but we will still have to wait and see
Bringing this show back is a mistake. Let it just rest already, after 4 separate finales at this point…
Now..... STOP CANCELING ONE OF THE GREATEST SHOWS SINCE EARLY SIMPSONS.  (Not the new ones lol)
The series ended in 2013, after having a spectacular infinite time loop conclusion, and after airing for 14 years, and being cancelled twice, and having 4 movies, now it’s back, can’t go wrong with more peak animated content, now I’m just waiting for some the amazing world of Gumball continuation.
Will all of the new episodes be available on July 24th?
I hope it keeps the same energy of the original show and this isn't just too good to be true
My zoidberg/slurm tattoo’s are screaming rn!!!!!!!!! 🥲🥲😭
There better be a moment where I cry my eyes out! Or I don’t want it 😂
I’m so excited for its return!!!!
It looks just like we haven't left the show
I'm all for this as long as they kept the woke filth out.
I feel like futurama is coming back a little bit late to get in on the Covid content but I’m sure it will still turn out fine
The original ended perfectly with the timeloop so they better write something good to make up for it. I'd love to see more Futurama I just don't want to see it ruined. Looks pretty good though.
FUTURAMA: Let’s See If We Can Have a Fourth Perfect Ending
Please don’t make it political
Brilliant 😎😁😎
Was that the Broax Kid?!
Mind you the sefies ended 10 years ago  Man its good to be back baby
Yeeeeeeeeaaaaahhh!!
This actually looks really good, can't wait to watch them
Yes!!!!! Death!       By snu snu
i'm glad my guys are back!
Thank you
Literally watched seasons 1-11 on Hurawatch just two weeks ago, had no idea a new season was going to release after a seven year cancellation, but I’ll watch
They back baby
I am a little annoyed because I feel like the comedy central era seasons ended on probably the best note the show could ever end on and I don't want Futurama to end up like The Simpsons but this *at least* looks to be *at least* on par with the comedy central era. The real test is hitting those out of nowhere heart wrenching moments.
Hulu is slowly starting to catch up to the other big streaming platforms
Okay but what if   Hear me out now guys   WHAT IF we made entirely new shows?
god i hope they can keep the quality up.  Disenchanted was a massive disappointment
They're showing us all the tings we recognize and love!  They're referencing things we know and enjoy!
I guess the second or third time's the charm? And there is absolutely no way any of these episodes will feel dated in like 5 to 10 years nope nope nope
Definitely can't wait to watch it again
Looks too meta with the crypto and covid parts.
I can’t wait!
Does the whole season come out at once?
Hopefully they have clever references like the singing boil named Susan on Leela (an extremely subtle and intelligent reference to the American Idol contestant named Susan Boyle).  :^)
I literally cannot muster any excitement for this.
So is it July 24th yet?
YESSS
wait, did they just retcon the ending of the timestop episode WITH the marriage?
Can't wait!!
It has the potential to be cool, or hot garbage.
0% chance this will be any good with today's "writers"
I hope they cancel the show Everybody Loves Hypnotoad for this, that show's been going down hill since Season 3 anyway and that Hypnotoad can bite my shiny metal as- ALL GLORY TO THE HYPNOTOAD!!!
Honestly looks great
I'm rebuying hulu for this
Good news eveyone... our favorite childhood tv show is back baby!! So hyped🥳
Futurama will keep returning as long as everyone stays alive and well. Can't wait!
For years I thought at least Futurama was able to die a modest death with 4 consistently great seasons. Then it came back, and all things considered those seasons weren't great but they weren't bad either. The final few seasons were pretty terrible, though, and I see this aspires to continue that trend.
It will never be the same as the first 5 Seasons. The golden years of entertainment are behind us. All that is left is filth. Humanity needs a reset to be able to enjoy anything.
Okay keep it on all the time now. You brought this show back Twice already for Seasons, on top of the movies, you may as well Simpsons it and keep it going until you're dead.
I thought it was finished permanently??? Is this a TROLL? or FOR REAL?!
man futurama had one of my favourite tv show endings next to breaking bad, not sure if  i have the highest hopes but i sure do love futurama, lets hope its one of the good seasons
You just know they're going to ruin it. It was great, it had a great ending, don't ruin it.
I remember watching new episodes every week back in high school, and here I am 20 years later doing the same thing.
oh yeah!!! the crew is back
Will this be on Disney + in the u.k?
Wow
Seeing this, my eyes just became dilated.
I'm so disappointed that every white character has not been turned black or asian
Feels like I went back to 1999.
It’s about time
If you look closely at the opening credits, you can see it almost spell HULUrama until it changes to FUTUrama
It looks great but the lip sync in the animation looks choppy
Really hope the explanation why this happens at all will be actually great because we know the two got old and reset everything back at the start creating a loop which starts back at E1 then goes right back to the Finale.
I'M SO EXCITED I loved Futurama as a kid and now 10 year later I get to rejoy it ❤😊❤
Why do they keep doing this? How many series finales has this show had?
This show is never actually cancelled. It just kind of takes a break for a few years.
Oh boy, can't wait for all the calm and rational discussions there will be surrounding "new disease" episode in all the online forums.
No way.... I can't believe it.
“From the creators of the simpsons” is such a disrespect to this show
It's 40% new ideas!
Im so glad that its coming back. I rewatched the entire series a few months ago and one of my coworkers told me it was returning. Im so excited to see what jokes and puns they have in store.
Thank you Matt for keeping Fry and Leela a couple and not resetting the relationship!
YEES YEES YEEES YEEES YEEES YEEES
I'm excited and will watch it but something is slightly off about some of the animation sequences. Maybe it's just a difference in frame rate.
nobody wanted a new season. let the series finish with dignity instead of squeezing money and ruining it.
Futurama fan for life. Imma get a bender tattoo soon
every show has to reference crypto and covid apparently
Explovid-24 and the nose thing 😂
Thank god John DiMaggio accepted to be in the new season. Futurama without Bender wouldn’t be the same.
Thank god disenchantment is dead. That show was a huge waste of potential.
Fun Fact: Futurama came out the same year as Rocket Power.
ROBERTO!!!
My childhood🥹
It just won't stay dead!
I don't know about this new season, I love Futurama but they ended it on a good note, I don't want the show to be like the Simpsons where it's keeps going and progressively gets worse
im excited to see the crew after so many years im just alittle worried of modern influence forced in there but i really want this season to be really really good
This show has been through Adult Swim, FOX , Comedy Central, and now Hulu. It just keeps coming back. And everytime it does, i get excited about its comeback. 🤩
I'm glad it looks like they haven't ret conned Fry and Leela's relationship.
I can't wait to do it hundreds of times!
Pullllllease bring this back to TV too.....   😣
It just won't stay dead!
I didn't see a single example of them messing it up... shocking.
Wow almost a decade and a half
We will se if its any good. From the track record of reboots though, Im not too hopeful.
❤️
*WE BACK BABEH, FOR A 3RD OR 4TH TIME...I LOST TRACK*
Futurama: The show that gets canceled so many times yet finds a way to come back.
IT'S HAPPENING!!!!! I have watched this series over 20 times from beginning to end at least.
ON MY BIRTHDAY????
I was just re-watching the whole series, niceee
THEY'RE BACK BABY
oh I can not wait! I wasn't even aware they were making more episodes!
The Hulu run will be better than the Comedy Central run. I can’t wait!
I have missed that theme song :)
I hope they lean into Dune references. They had a couple sprinkled through the series, but come on...
is it a reboot or continuing where they left off?
❤
In my eyes it already ended. Reviving it today with current buzzwords just feels soulless
OH MY GOD IT’S FUTURAMA BUT WITH EPISODES ABOUT CRYPTO AND COVID ?!!!! SO RECENT MUCH RELATABLE ;)))))) (seriously though it looks alright and I’m not a futurama fan so I can’t really compare it to the show before)
im happy its back but it is one of those rare shows that ended so well.
Great...we don't have Hulu in canada...such bulllll
🗣️🔥🔥🔥
I have no strong feelings one way or the other.
:)
Highlight of the year!
I’ve been watching the original run to get ready for this, I’m so excited!!
How can I watch the new season in Germany? There's no Hulu here :/
Good to hear that theme again
Stop
LESSGO
Not the revival we deserved but the one we needed
One of the best shows of the 2000s. I'm really excited
I will RIOT if chanukah zombie isn't an integral part of the plot
Hands down one of the most comforting shows I know of. It feels like old friends are back, again. I hope this go around is better than the last few seasons and the movies, but I will consume anything these show creators make. Much appreciation to the crew and cast, thank you for being a core part of my life.
They beat this horse so many times it’s been ground into the dirt
How long until this version is cancelled?
I dunno about this, man.
Man I really hope they do the Covid in one episode and leave it at that.
Thank you for bringing one of my favorite shows back!
Lol great
Rehashes and tired references.
I've never been so happy 😍😭
The writing seems to be much worse.  I guess that's what you should expect from Disney.
Cool its on my birthday and i dont even watch Futurama
So Bender doesn't sound like Bender even though the original guy that voiced Bender is back voicing Bender?
At the same time I'm excited that it's back but also worried it might be one season too many. One of the strongest point to me that Futurama had over the Simpsons was that it was not ongoing and had an ending. I'll wait and see how this will go.
Futurama was so good when I was younger, loved their humor. This could be great, or horrible.. please don't be horrible.
Please be funnier than the Comedy Central days
Please make a zoidberg oriented episode 🙏
Never forget they didn’t want to pay John DiMaggio nearly enough to play Bender, at first.
Poor John has to do that gravelly bender voice again
You just know it's going to be trash when they have to revive a series that literally ended on an infinite loop
the nostalgia is coming back baby
Futurama I think will cement itself as Groenings best work. The breaks/cancellations work in it's favour in the long run, the show stays fresh, the cast doesn't have to feel exhausted about their roles. The writers can come at it with a new perspective. I wish other shows like American dad would do the same.
So, did they break the time loop?
Cool! I don't know who asked for this or why it's happening (money), but the original creators are here. So, I'm here for it!
Ok, so we at least have an explanation for the breaking of the stable time loop. The professor put the time machine in reverse.
Some of those jokes seem a bit 2010s Simpsonsy which was giving me the uh-ohs but then I remembered it’s just a trailer and they’re always a bit stilted, I’m just so excited to see new Futurama :D
Grew up on futurama. Fell asleep SO many nights to it. still do.
I'm sorry but this looks just as bad as the last couple of seasons. Hope the jokes in the new season aren't all like this but I doubt it, it's just "RECENT THING, BUT IN THE FUTURE AGAIN!!!" this wasn't acceptable with the eyepod, why would it be acceptable now
Not gonna lie but you can hear Billy West getting older. Compared to the previous seasons, this new one he sounds off when doing Zoidberg, the professor, Fry, and Zapp.
Finally some good news everyone!  At least they can milk this franchise for another 977 years or so.
please don't be cringe please don't be cringe please don't be cringe
You can hear the age in Billy’s voice, specifically as Zoidberg :’(
Covid jokes? Really?
First the second FNAF Trailer,  and now The Second futurerama, what a time to  be alive
JINKX MONSOON!  I SWEAR TO GOD THE NEXT PODCAST UPDATE BETTER BE YOUR REACTION THIS
I’m hoping this show keeps its morals, it was very silly sure, but it had some morals, it also was beautifully written, one example Would be the episode about fry needing the devil’s hands, it showed that you don’t need to be extraordinarily talented to be of worth.
I love futureama, but please let it die and stay dead
didnt Bender say he wasn't going to do anymore voice over for Futurama?
Hopefully not too many modern-day references. They tend to age badly. A few too many in this trailer.
How long has it been since we had a new futurama season?
IT'S HAPPENING
Nothing hits my nostalgia more than 1:45 the perfect perfect mini outro
I really hope we get a Torgo’s joke
I know my other favorite character won't even make an appearance but i hope Scruffy gets a big part in this season
Good news everyone✨
Why
From the creator of The Simpsons (AND DISENCHANTMENT, please?)
Sweet i love futurama
All these people in here talking about how nostalgic this makes them feel, and then there's me over here who still watches it on repeat every single day haha! (Yes I am also 100% excited to have new episodes to add to the playlist)
I am excited
The show that never dies!
This looks amazing! Definitely seems like they are continuing right where they left off, even doing the same old gags of making fun of the new network they are on. Good news everyone!
Can't wait!
So 3000
Futurama is my comfort show
"What do you say? Wanna go around again?" YES.
Can't wait for hulu to blindside these animators with the cancelation like they did with Animaniacs.
I'm sure lot's of people have high expectations and they should it was a great show so don't spit on it
We're Back Baby
The Second Coming of Futurama! Or, Third. Fourth? I dunno, I've lost count. :/
Thank you for keeping it ORIGINAL! Looks exactly the same. The humor / Animation and everything else! Cannot wait.
What? This wasn't a joke after all
SCREAMING
I don't have Hulu so I'm wondering if Disney+ will get it in the UK. Either way, I'm ready
They back :)
LETS GO ALREADY!!
Good they keep fry and lela together
this show was amazing, i can't wait to watch i hope they stay true to the orginal
so happy its back
This means we might get to see Fry and Leela have children one day I’m so excited ❤️❤️❤️ I love futurama
lets go this is my favourite tv series
Some of these episodes seem a bit on-the-nose, no?
...yyyYYYEEEEEEESSSSSS🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Finally!
What's creepy? The scented oils or the fuzzy cuffs?
Looks like A LOT of references to past episodes. I hope they still have mostly original episodes, way too many primetime cartoons endlessly retread their past premises nowadays, and that's very boring to watch. Don't Rick and Morty yourselves, Futurama.
So it's a continuation of the ending I see, I cannot wait to see how it plays out c:
Now bring back King of The Hill!
😂😂😂😂😂😀😀😀
Let me be straightforward here. Futurama was a great show while it lasted. It was one of my favourite projects by Matt Groening, second only to The Simpsons. But let me make this clear; it was great while it lasted.   When the show had its first rebirth, it showed that it still had momentum left in it. But by its second ending, it really did all it could. And for a while, I thought it was better that way. I didn't want Futurama to keep going till it lost its spark. I hoped it wouldn't end up like 'Fairly Odd Parents' did.  Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong? I thought that the show might return again at some point. But only time will tell if it'll last as long.
I wonder how long this series will keep being cancelled and returning.
Futurama is now more futuristic and more modern. So weird
I mean, i felt like it was finally finished.
You see, TV audiences don’t want anything original. They wanna see the same thing they’ve seen thousands of times before.
FUTURAMA NEVER DIESSSSSS
yeeeeaaaahhh!!!!!!! thanks creators for this amazing gift!!!!
This dark and sad world has gotten a little bit brighter... Futurama is back
That burro joke was *chef kiss*
Seriously? Futurama? What happen with Rick and Morty????
More zapp brannigan can only be a good thing
Good news everyone we’ve been saved yet again from cancellation take that studio executives
Sobreviví a la pandemia solo para ver el regreso de bender.
I laughed at the trailer I have hope for this new season
Remember when Zoidberg said "It's Zoid'n Time" and Zoid'ed all those guys?!
I have a bad feeling about this
Let's go
THE EGG SALAD WORMS ARE COMING BACK
Oh my god, I'm actually so happy it's back. I'm not crying, you are.
Please please pleaaaaaaase dont wokify this show this show is one of my favorite cartoons.
Deep hurting
Scruffy is back and that´s all that Matters
Let's go futurama is the best🔥
I thought Futurama retired
They back, baby!
Glad the animation and humor looks the same after almost a decade
We're back baby!
They actually listened to the audience. Miraculous.
I didn't expect this show to come back, but I'm glad all the same
thank you hulu and to the makers of futurama  you brought back the besh show ever
glad futurama is back disenchantment is the most unfunny boring show, up there with big mouth.
Benderrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
I'm usually nervous about show revivals like this, but this isnt Futurama's first rodeo.
To think they almost replaced Bender who makes the show
We're back baby!
My god… this is gonna be fun!
Kinda sad they still feel they have to say "From the creators of The Simpsons"
WE’RE BACK, BABY!
Most unnecessary trailer ever, who in the right mind wouldn’t watch it?
YESSSS!!!!! 😊😊😊😊
I don't think it's a good idea tbh. The writing was flawless because it was true to its time  The end was perfect. Why add more ?
It's Futuramin Time.
I’m so glad John DiMaggio is returning as Bender. He almost wasn’t, but he is
Finally cant wait 4 july.
I love this show. I hope they don't ruin it. As much as I would like more seasons of this show, sometimes it's better to let a show die while it's still good rather than let it drag out a slow, painful demise like the Simpsons.
Ya cant keep Futurama down, it's like covid, keeps coming back
Didn't Roberto die?
Loved this show as a kid, now it returns on my birthday, love to see it.
Nice 👌🏽
Hands down favorite animated series!
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
The writers really know what the fans want; classic Futurama!
futurama is a phoenix
Matthew 24:12 And because iniquity(ἀνομία,:Lawlessness: the desire to have no rule or law of God.) shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. 2 Timothy 3:1-9, Matthew 24:7 Nation = έθνος = Ethnos = race: different groups and segregations of people, Matthew 24:8 Beginnings of sorrows is likening and calling the situation to the birth pangs of women in which contractions of labor get more frequent and intense the closer the baby gets to delivery, so in context shall the things aforementioned and in relation to the verse in the Holy Bible will get more frequent and intense the closer christ gets to returning.
Futurama back at it again for the third time 👏👏 hope this time around Hulu lets them go for as long as they want to.
Finally! Missed this amazing show!
00:56 Dune Reference They made another dune, on this return.  how exciting
God bless who ever did this
Why another season? It ended perfectly
The Futurama is back? Hooray!
Right when I got into Futurama a few months ago, I found out there’s going to be a new season of this show. My timing is just incredible!
From the creators of Pimpsons and Assorama
Thank you John for coming back to voice Bender
outta nowhere.
No one asked Futurama to be brought back. It was perfect the way it was. So not looking forward to this.
I hope Bender changes gender again. He made a great wet-lipped floozie.
Dang a reboot that looks good and seems faithful to the original, can't wait for more episodes!
Awesome bringing this show back😊
It's been 20+ years and yet the voice actors still sound GREAT! Keep in mind that half the cast are in their late 60s/early 70s!
1:20 LIMBO!!!!!
2 great shows come back thanks to hulu. Animaniacs and Futurama
It actually looks not bad. Was super worried when i heard they were going to do a covid episode. Everyone was so afraid to make fun of the nonsense but zoidberg's line about it gave me some hope.
i preety pumped for this but based on the jokes in this ad i feel like they keep going one line over with these jokes
I hope there's dvd commentaries xD
YESS
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Topical jokes from 2 years ago
I was expecting modern humor that recent simpsons episodes but suprisingly enough this looks way better very good first look im happy they kept the classic humor of the characters very glad they didnt modernize and keep the show style cant wait to see more 😂😊(i wasnt a fan of the outdated covid humor in middle of trailer but ill give it a shot nonetheless it will be nice to see bender take on the whole pandemic scene.
no way
I have no expectations
Seasons 6-7 were abominations. I expect this one to be too. Sadly.
i'm glad we have it confirmed that fry is not packing a dumpy
You can't prove it won't happen.
futurama is one of my favorite shows of all time, i cant wait to watch the new season!
after how disappointing clone high season 2 was I'm REALLY hoping this is as good as this trailer makes it seem
Bender is great!
I didn’t laugh once, and not even close, they should have left this show dead.
+
Let's see how woke this show is. In this day and age nothing can truly die. Everything has to come back because everyone is creatively bankrupt
Omg yes!!!!! The names “ ZAPP BRANNIGAN “ 😂lower , lower,WHOA!!! To low….. lower.
Hearing that theme again and seeing that title card is blessing me with levels of nostalgia beyond what I'm normally capable of processing
thank you hulu for not being hbo max. i think ill renew my subscription after 8 years.
Кайфы
Omg! Really?
They're Back Baby!!!!! And That Is Bender, Please Insert Liquor
Please oh please don't woke all over it!
Thanks.
please oh please don't get sanitized for ''modern audience''
Sweet something of someplace... they're back again! And about time too!
They Better not ruin it with real life politics.
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Im not mad at the return, but the last season finale was perfect.
Please no. Please. Let this show go already.
Yay!
Природа настолько очистилась)))
Show had the greatest ending… can’t wait to see it turn into woke 💩. 🤣🍿
Praying it stays faithful to the OG Futurama.  Can't wait to check it out, truly one of the best animated shows of all time.
Is it July 24th, or July 2024?
Shut up and take my money!
Nice
To think this was never going to happen if they didn’t bring back John DiMaggio. Can’t wait for this.
me hearing the music: ooooooh, remix.🎶🎶
First Ian and Anthony reunite to form Smosh and now Futurama is coming back?! THERE IS A GOD!!!
I've seen Simpsons episodes saying bring back Futurama. Probably another Prediction of there's.
I am excited to say the least.
YES YES YES!!!!!
Not even out yet and the social commentary already feels dated.
This is such a dream come true. FUTURAMA BABYYYY
I’m glad calculon is back I missed him he one of my Favorite side characters next to Roberto,Robot Santa and Kwanza Bot (RIP).
please dont fluke this up
I really don't know if this is necessary
NO WAYYY i was just thinking about how futurama was a masterpiece that died too soon
Here's to 'Futurama, fall of Hulu'!
THEY BROUGHT THE WORMS BACK
Looks like he updated the forward time machine to include a backwards option.
The greatest show of all time is back!!! WE'RE BACK BABY!!!!!!!!!!
It's like it never even ended. Hope it doesnt disappoint!
Oh.
I was basing if this was going to be good enough based on the first site gag.  I will be watching.
No
Prikolno nadeyus budet tak je kruto...
Been watching this series since I was a kid and caught the pilot back in '99. This is weird man... But still looks like *Fun on a Bun Baby! Woooohooooo!!*
Explovid-23.. Created in the year 3023 and spreaded in 3024
Fry did it!!!
King of the hill and Futurama coming back! Pinch me
Futurama is back, baby!
can’t believe it ended 10 years ago. still feels recent
MY CHILDHOOD! BACK! YES! NOW I'M 28 AND THIS COULDN'T BE MORE BEAUTIFUL! FUTURAMA FOREVER! ♾️!
THE BORAX KID!!?!?
Cant wait 🤩
I AM SO EXCITED!!!
Ngl, this kinda just seems soulless
YES!
Obsidian
It's official, this show can't be canceled. They just stick it in a cryopod and wait a few years until people forget that it got canceled, and tell us it was never canceled to begin with. Big brain moves.
☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆ They're back babyyyyy ☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆
THE BORAX KID!
This is fun on the bun
At the end of the Trailer Bender should have said  "WE'RE BACK BABY, AGAIN"
I REALLY, REALLY HOPE they don't run this show into the ground. It's happened too many times these days and I don't want it to happen here.
I almost can't belive it's back. the nostalgia is so strong.
God this show was the light in the darkness for thank you hulu for bringing it back
The topical jokes are a little on the nose, but overall this still feels like Futurama. I genuinely laughed at Fry apologizing for being a flatty.
Wait I thought this show had a perfect ending, what happened?
Not sure if Disney is the best thing for Futurama, take what they have done to the Simpsons as a example
Looks good but why are we still making the same exact covid jokes 3 years later? It wasnt even funny at the start, just low hanging fruit
This actually looks really good
Yes, yes and yes.
I hope they managed to keep the same charm that made Futurama so hilarious and relatable
I've been a fan of Futurama since the very beginning, it's my comfort show and I know it all by heart. I even have a Futurama tattoo, so you have NO idea how hyped I am for this, I'm sO READY TO SEE THE GANG AGAIN, I MISSED THEM SO MUCH
We're so back
I loved this show! It's the best!   "Shut up, baby! I know it!" 😂
no way
Oh God this is going to flop 🤦‍♂️ the shows based 1000 years in the future, with most likely advanced medicine thats far superior to anything we have now, yet its making a COVID episode....and a crypto currency episode......you can't base episodes on current events 1000 years in the future. This isn't Southpark.
It's back baby
Return Of A Legendary Show!
This finna great❤
my body is ready.
Looks like Fry and Leela are moving in together ❤.  Now who's gonna be Bender's new roommate?   Why not Zoidberg?
Just please don't go woke
But the final ending was so good though.     on the other hand more Futurama woooo!!!
It was never that great of show before
Futurama really got its seasons confused. For streaming, it's Season 11, but for TV,  it's Season 8. Hopefully it still plays on Comedy Central
Futurama is a truly timeless show.   I’m ok with it ending but I’m also on with it Coming back. I can’t wait to see these guys back in action!🎉
Best thing EVER!!!
When hulu worldwide?
Ohh boy I'm ready
Explovid-13 ☠️😂😂😂
LET'S FREAKIN GOOOOOO!!!!
This is gonna be awesome. Period.
If it's 3023, is Fry now in his late forties lol
oh cool. crypto references. yay.
Whoever fought to bring this show back again, thank you. Thank you so freaking much, I hope all your dreams come true.
Just hope this is better than the Comedy Central seasons
Why is there a hashtag for Disney? How am I supposed to support this if they are involved in any way? I hope it’s just a mistake but I’m not gonna hold my breath. Was excited for this till that hashtag.
Hey it looks like the backgrounds have improved a lot! I'm a bit anxious but extremely happy regardless!  Also I'm thrilled they're letting Leela and Fry stay a couple!
I love Futurama, but this looks like the worst writing ever. Not one line was funny.
Im gonna be 100%... I really do not like the direction this is heading.
The ONE good thing that has happened in 2023
Why cant they let it end? Nothing good ever comes from reviving old shows
Yo my man fry is wild at the end😂😂
Oh nahhhhhhhhhhh
Just cried tears of joy, I always watched this as a kid
no frickin' way
BENDER'S BACK, BABY!!!
Oh my god 2023 Futurama is kinda weird to see
10 year old me would be exploding rn
'Meanwhile' was one of the best finales of any season. Can't change my mind on that, it just makes me sad knowing they'll bring this series back, enjoy a few laughs but one its time to properly end the series they'll probably never will meet Meanwhile's standard and if they don't end it it'll become like Family Guy just mot character development or plot whatsoever
Hi tenesha lynn getts
I'm kinda a bit conflicted on the new season. I liked how the shows ending gave you the chance to rewatch it over from the beginning. But I'm glad there's more. I just wonder if they'll incorporate the ending or just forget about it entirely.
OMG! YES YES YES! OMG TY CREATORS FOR BRINGING THIS BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Stop. Its already dead.
“WE’RE BACK BABY!”
Please be good. Please be good.
I have literal goosebumps😭😭😭
I wish they didn't revive it. Futurama ended on a good note, is nothing sacred anymore?
Wonder if it will be as good as it’s 90s counterpart.
Humor is about 3 years outdated
Looks weird
Hope for it to be as good of a return as we would like.
YES!!!!!! IT JUST WONT STAY DEAD!!!!!!
I'm glad they kept the style consistant and didnt go for a weird reboot-y new art style
Hooooly. I have some hope I HAVE SOME HOOOOOOOOOOPE! *praying*
Something feels weird about the animation in parts. It just doesn’t feel like the original, especially the way the heads move when the rest of the body doesn’t.
LETSGOOOO
We are back, baby!
from fox, adult swim, comedy central, and now on hulu, futurama is back baby!
About time netflix let go of this series, they have a bad track record, and I'm glad to see this series come back as well
Futurama always remained fresh to me no matter how many time I rewatched. I’m really happy it’s back again
THE RETURN :DDDDDDDD
That awkward moment when I just finished the entire series so I'm past nostalgia, now the wait won't be as long😅
Good news everyone!  We have a reboot!
Irá a estar en Star+ en latam?
New season. Same old futurama. Can't wait!
It's official... anything Matt touches turns to gold. TWO shows now that have failed to quit. It's remarkable! Can't wait for new Futurama!
I can't wait
SO happy this is back! Can't wait!
People… am I dreaming? ❤😂🎉
classic is back
Lets go alreadyyyyyyyy!!!
Ahhhhhhh!!!!! I'm actually looking forward to this!!! I hope the team and writing is just as good as I remember from back then!!!!!
Now if only Spectacular Spider-Man could make a comeback
Ah yes another series that they just couldn't leave in the past with a good ending. Time to drudge it up in the name of the almighty dollar
OmgOmgOmgOmg this is my favorite show
Im in tears !!! Futurama is my favorite show !! Been watching it since it came out on adult swim
crypto and covid jokes........  reeaaaallly topical right now.....  This is just a cash grab, the time loop ending is the canon ending for me. They're just milking an almost dead cow.
Can't wait for Johnny2Cellos to break this trailer down. (And for the new season)
I AM HAPPY HAPPY TO THIS HAPPENED, FUTURAMA IS BACK!
Four More Seasons I mean Years!
Come on the good old Times, we want snoo snoo😅
Hopefully they carry on just where they left off instead of trying to go over the top with characters like most shows.
More sexy Amy, more leela & fry, more bender being bender, this years gonna rock!
This is going to be so bad. I am looking forward to it.
This has to be at least the 5th time it has been canceled and brought back
Stop bringing this show back
Hulu, SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!
Futurama stay canceled challenge: IMPOSSIBLE
Where in crypto country😂😂😂
Yes
Okay now I got a reason to get Hulu
I’m so glad to see this again
“From the same people who brought you the simpsons” … which season of the simpsons?.. WHICH SEASON
YES!!!
I'm looking forward to this show getting cancelled and renewed over and over again, for the remainder of my life and beyond.
my favorite part of futurama is when fry said "it's futurama time" and started futuramaing all over the place
Descanse em paz dubladora da Leela no Brasil. Espero que honre sua voz e a personagem a pessoa que pegar esse manto.
Cannot wait. 100% love this show
and now I have to binge watch everything again... 😊
I used to watch so much futurama back then, let’s goooo
*It’s official, futurama is IMMORTAL*
It refuses to stay cancelled yet again😅
For god's sake leave this show alone!!!!
Nogla
Nooo wayyy, it’s really gonna be comin backkkkk
That one time where it really did take your dad 10 years to get cigarettes from the store and come back
dont worry about me I`m looking for johnny2cellos
“We’re back, baby!” Glad to see a triumphant return!
thank you mom corp(disney corp)
Shocked it looks good.
How is this already dated?
Yup, definitely Futurama.
I love this show. Please don't end
I recently started rewatching the series. I loved the show as a kid when I’d catch it on Adult Swim at night, but I don’t think I ever truly realized just how incredible a show this really was until recently. So many great episodes and memories. I really hope this turns out great.
Yesssssssss! It's back!!!!!
omg omg omg omg omg omg omg!
This looks so good and still has the same humor and vibe it did! I hope this season is successful so they could renew it for another season because I want more!
I won't be gone long Seymour, just wait here til I come back... 🥺
One of the best animated series their is
The borax kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid!
omg yes always loved futurama go bender
I’m surprised they sound the same
Thank goodness they still kept their comedy
That one line at the start of The Simpsons crossover has now aged poorly.
Meanwhile was such a great finale 😢
YEAH!
My only issue with this is that every Billy West voice has a noticeable scratchiness to it. Other than that, we’re good!
Two things:  1. So cool that Futurama still gets chances to shine even today!  2. Touching that Fry and Leela are finally an official couple after so many teases and so closes.
It has been 3000 years…
Noticing in the scenes with Mom she only has two of her sons with her (Larry and Igner), Walt isn't there. Does this mean we'll get an episode focused on him? Like how Igner got the TV film focused on him
I’m so excited oml
So happy all the original voices are back too
Can't wait for its next cancelation!!
YES
They did covid in 2023... Lost me there
I love that contrary to so many revivals or reboot they didn't feel the need to change drawings designs.
My only tiny nitpick is some references to the stuff in our modern day which may heavily date some episodes(virus one, cryptoland and Alexa thing) but considering we haven't had many good adult cartoons in a while(or atleast one that weren't cancelled) I'll give new Futurama season a shot, hope it's as good as it used to be! 😊
It was canceled??? I thought the series had ended naturally???
This looks amazing. They haven't skipped a beat
OMFG YEEEES!
great i love when shows take current events and ram rod it into their show /sarcasm
OMG! I'm so excited! But does this mean Futurama will be pulled down from Disney+? Better rewatch the entire series to spark my memories!
Futurama. The third most popular Matt Groening creation that refuses to die.  Fulu is what happens when all of the major Studios fold-in to their streaming services and all the major streaming services left on Earth fold into one.
"What do you say, wanna go around again?" - Philip J Fry
after the Rick and Morty debacle we really needed this Hulu do thank you
Wonder if there will be another Simpsons crossover...
No thank you.
I'm happy benders back
This is gonna be NUTS!  I just wonder how things will resume after the last finale
Okay, NOW I am excited
you had me till you did covid and crypto jokes
They still do pandemic jokes in 2023? 😕
It’s been 10 years since the end of futurama now it’s back baby
I think the end of the Futurama last episode of a few years ago was the day went back in time, but they don’t remember what happened except Professor Farnsworth to it just redo into a new event
WE'RE BACK BABY!!!
0:33 Oh BELIEVE me that's not a boast these days
Let's just hope this isn't a lame cash grab and actually has some substance.
I expect one sad episode 🥲
god Fry saying "yes plz" to the mother echo just made me hate myself...
I hope you can bring back the original voice actor here in mexico sonmuch nostalgia😢
this looks like hot garbage
Dang, im not sure how i feel about this. I LOVE this show but the ending was perfect. For those who dont remember, they ended the show by going through a portal and "doing it all over again" that way you can watch the first episode after the last and still feel like it was all a part of the story. I hope they dont ruin the series
Hope it doesn’t get bastardized like all other reboots
Just finished watching the show a couple weeks ago and can safely say it is my second favorite adult animated show right behind South Park. Excited to watch this revival and can’t wait to see more Zoidberg who is my favorite character from the show
OH MY GOLLY. GOSH
Oh boy can't wait for the COVID and cryptocurrency satire episodes. Definitely hasn't been enough of that already. And so topical in 2023 too.
i cant wait!
I hope there will be finally a Warhammer reference in this one
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOO🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I CANT WAIT FOR THIS LET'S GOOOOOO
Good lord the Q tip scene hurt to look at.
How dare they make fun of an active pandemic! Didn't they see all of North Korea in masks, doing their part to save the world?! Just two more weeks to slow the spread!!!
Cant wait for this
Finally footage ❤🔥
I used to think getting a new season was fake, like boxing, but now I know it’s real, like wrestling!
say what?
It can't come any sooner! I'm so excited! 😅
Wow, just let franchises die already
I heard you get a free cancel after getting cancelled 10 times? I'll be here for every revival!
We're back baby!
My favorite episode was the willy wonka parody lol
Does Bender have the same voice actor as Jake thr Dog?
I loved watching Futurama with my girlfriend. Now we can watch new episodes with our son!
welcome back Futurama
I'm excited but nervous. I hope they didn't mess this up.
Futurama should be an anime.
nice nostalgiabait
I'm ... cautiously optimistic? It looked a LITTLE bit heavy on references to 'current' (read: 2 years ago at least) events but it's entirely possible that they put nearly everything they had in the trailer because that's what they think will hook people. But I hope there's more than just "Remember when this happened BUT IN SPACE?!". Futurama straddled the line between parody, satire and its own "lore" incredibly well for the most part and I can imagine it's very hard to maintain that balance.   I'll definitely watch it, and I'd love for it to be good.
I can't wait man I love futurama
I been falling asleep to Futurama of years lol. about time to get some new episodes!
Peak incoming 🔥👏🥶 💯
Looking forward to it hope it’s on Disney plus I don’t have Hulu in my country
Can't wait to see how mid it'll end up
Love this show so much
Can't wait for another of my favourite show to be ruined
The show that get cancelled more than twice and still come back strong, love it.
No way!  I’m gonna cry now😭
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Meh, everything looks the same. I'll give it a watch.
Again?
I have the entire series, Im rewatching it all. Im soooo frigging HYPED! Now I have to sub to Hulu when it comes out.  Looks like it hasn't even changed either, which I love the most about it coming back! THANK YOU SO MUCH @hulu !
Yes...YEEEEESSSSS. The crew is back baby!  WiIl to live: restored
I'm actually not happy.  They ruined the perfect ending for COVID and Crypto jokes?
Thanks Hulu for bringing back my fav show 😁 F Simpsons
Nope, nope, nope, you had a satisfying ending before, you should've just left it alone. Don't Toy Story 4 this.
I teared up omg I can't believe it's real and almost here!!
Honestly? They didn't have to do this. I was happy with how they ended it, and content to have my reruns. I was never really THAT impressed with Hulu but if they're bringing Futurama back I guess I'll HAVE to keep it around.
I'm back baby
I just started getting into futures yesterday so waking up to this after I finished the series is like a chefs kiss, can’t wait !
Honestly, after the Animaniacs reboot, I'm skeptical about this one.
There wasn't a single part of this trailer I didn't like.
After all the struggles over the years with Covid, war, and rubbish tv programs, I am happy this is back
Hulu better not can this like they did with anamaniacs
Yoooooooo! It’s crazy cuz I’m currently rewatching the series
Please God, just let this show rest in peace. To their credit though, they resisted the urge to turn Fry into a disabled, nonbinary black lesbian. So credit to them on that, I guess.
Grew up on Futurama as a child, I’ve watched every episode and it brought me through so many adventures and emotional rollercoasters. I just recently resubscribed to Hulu and I can’t wait!
Seriously?  They brought it back *AGAIN?*  Is this their way of admitting that Disenchantment has sadly gone completely off the rails in its last season and is now likely unsalvageable?  Honestly, I'm not optimistic about this.  The last sequence of the last episode of the last season was the *perfect* send-off, as Chopin's Etude played us out.  It will be *impossible* to top that.
Finally 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
it's like they never left
I’ve spent most of my life waiting for this, i almost can’t believe it’s actually happening.
Amazing how they managed to keep the same look and feel from the original seasons. Usually whenever shows are revived they have this modern look to them that makes them feel a bit off.
Are you freakin kidding me???
I cannot believe it
Why?
No way, they're bringing back the time machine from The late Philip J. Fry. It's my favourite episode.
Fap.
As I get older, nostalgia hits harder. Whether this show flops or not, I appreciate them trying to revitalize child hood memories and creating new ones.
0:04 even in reboot leela still acts like the masculine girl
Finally
Here. We go. AGAIN!!!!! 🥳
Bender 🖤🤍
How many times is this show going to get cancled and then return?
Don’t get me wrong, this looks good and doesn’t seem like current animation that’s run it’s course long ago(Simpsons, Family Guy, American Dad). But the last iteration ended perfectly to the point where we don’t even need more.
huray!!!! thanks hulu
Not a fan of them bringing the series back.   The ending to the series was perfect due to it ending in a time-loop where the first season was the beginning of a new timeline in the universe.   Just please let it die with some dignity.
Good News Everyone! 👨‍🔬 😄😄😄 It's funny how much I missed hearing that (lol)
Gotta have Roberto 😂 Small parts BUT A LEGEND
Horray
YESSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Awesome
... OK, I was on the train of "Yeah, it was good but just let it die peacefully already!" But this actually looks pretty dec.
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOO
When this show gets cancelled, again, PLEASE give us a Bender show!! TAKE MY MONEY ALREADY!!
I am really glad to have Futurama back. These same characters I know and love, and it looks like they still remain true to what this show is. I truly look forward to this show's return.
Been into this show so much I write fan fictions with my own characters in them.  They're darker and more action packed but they're worth checking out.
NO ONE ASKED FOR THIS 😡  (It ended so well/brilliantly. I hope they can pull it off, but should have left it as it was. 😒)
Every lines bender says are dope!!
Futurama: "Oh god! No! I want to liiiiiiive"
cant wait for this show to be hit by woke culture and ruined
Wait a minute... It isn't April fools day, this is real!
I always like Futurama better than the Simpsons, but this seemed kinda off to me... Like it's not going to be as funny as before. Hope I'm wrong
DUDE IT ACTUALLY LOOKS GOOD!!!
“BITE MY SHINY METAL AXE!”- King Zøg of Dreamland
Whut.  Well, maybe this time they truly take advantage of serialisation (given how it took a while for Disenchantment took a while to figure it out).
Good news, everyone!
So... Americans can watch...  Uhm  What about the rest of the world?  You know,  the other 90% of the world's population?  As a Canadian, and HUGE fan of Futurama... but not willing to move to the states or hack my VPN, how can I watch?
This season is gonna be fun on the bun!
This is gonna be fun on a bun!
FINALLYYYYYY ANOTHER SEASONNNN
I almost want to see Futurama get cancelled again, so we can see how they poke fun of it when they come back.
what a terrible idea
Jesse approves this
Rest in peace canadians who have no way of watching it
Wait this show is still running? That's pretty cool ngl
😍😍😍
I'm glad people are being civil and positive in the comments since this actually looks like a genuine effort to renew the show properly
I see the writters have a lot to say on whats happened in the past 5 years lol I love it
Theyre doing a WHAT
I really hope the jokes are better than what's shown in this trailer....
What do you say? Want to go around again?
This really is good news,everyone
WHY TF
YEEEEHAAAA, I AM SO READY FOR THIS SEASON YEAAAAAAA!!!!!
This series just refuses to die doesn’t it?
After 10 years of waiting and more bad Simpsons episodes, Futurama is finally back! Again!
Yaayyy! Calculon's back!
where is the robot devil ;-;
Yesss!!! I love Futurama💜😍👍🥳
Thank you Hulu! 🙌 👏 🎉
Ah it's good to know we're still gonna hear some version of 'YOU CALLIN ME CRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAzy?!'
no just no why just why
this looks kinda mid
From adult swim- Comedy Central- Hulu  Futurama for life
I had imagined an episode of Futurama that makes fun of the COVID pandemic. Well it looks like now I might have found it.
Brilliant. Bender.
Love futurama, but are they really gonna use Crypto and Covid this late? I hope they don't use nfts
Never in my entire life haven't laughed as much as I did on this trailer!
They just, showed up.
My biggest worry was the artwork was gonna be changed, I'm so glad they didn't and kept it classic!
Stop bro it had a fantastic ending it's over give up
Couldn’t stop grinning the entire time.
Looks awesome, can’t wait to watch
Their back, Baby!
I don't know why, but the jokes feel too flat. Well, the entire trailer felt like I had seen it all before. It seems that the new season is a parasite on the previous ones.
OH MY GOD WHAT IS THIS? 😭 I NEVER IMAGINED THIS COULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN
Yess!!!!!
This and the fnaf movie? Today is a hella good day
Futurama is back baby
I have never seen a series get cancel and come back so mamy times. I hope this one keeps the high quality of the other seasons.
Tbh for a moment i was worried, but the trailer got a few chuckles out of me, so we'll see how it holds up (looks promising so far), Futurama is one of those shows that I always love to revisit- so nostalgic.
The jokes and writing seem lazier and not as smart.
I’ve lost count on how many times Futurama has come back and every time it makes me happy.   I remember having the first three seasons on dvd and watching them over and over with friends before the first comeback thinking too bad there won’t be any more 😢.
What a nice birthday gift
You know who didn't survive the massive disruption in the flow of time?  Fry's dog.
Just when we needed it most, it returned
THEIR BACK BABY!
Normally I'd be skeptical of a series revival, but as long as the show is still run by the same geniuses, it'll be a hit.
Hope Nixon returns
10 years later its finally back.
just let it all dieeeeeee, this is a nightmareeee, goddd
This is the best news I've heard all month!!!!
YES! I LOVE THIS AND THE SIMPSONS!
WOOOOO We're Back Baby!!!!!
Futurama will never die....The professor has a time machine!
10 years later!
I'm so excited!!  I can't wait to watch the new season of Futurama.   Then watch it get canceled again. Then, have it come back on Netflix. Then watch it get canceled again. Then come back on Peacock. Then get canceled again. Then, have it come back on Blockbuster 2.0  Then have it cancel again.   That last cancelation was caused by the entire original cast, dying of old age.
that just made me happier.
dude even the bot accounts are excited about this.
yes
Omg
Was tryin to decide which service to keep, Hulu just won
The jokes are hitting, I’m liking what I see
News, everyone!
That's crazy
Once again, Futurama has yet another great "series finale" episode downgraded to just a "season finale" episode...
nah this should have ended tbh
Either this trailer is bad or the show is going down the same exact root that reboots do
I really hope this ends up being good. I love this show, only saw all of it fairly recently, but it's still quite nostalgic for me.
it’s like they never left
This actually looks pretty faithful to the original, I hope they don't rely too much on topical humor (COVID etc)
Who else cried and laughed?
fantastic
uhhhhhhhhhh
GOOD NEWS EVERYONE
That’s what I love about animated shows; we get older, they stay the same age
A series that really deserves to stay on air, thank you for bringing it back
This show refuses to die, I love it
That burro joke got me more than it should have.
So glad we finally have a date! Been fluted to news on this since it was announced that Hulu picked it up. Now I just need a local friend who has Hulu to watch it with cause I ain't paying those asinine subscription prices. 🤣🤣🤣
so i’m seeing episodes about covid and crypto, let’s go
And then next year we get king of the hill, if we get a Malcolm in the middle revival it’s over. Excited for futurama!
Good news everyone. We somehow avoided a satisfying conclusion to the show!
Ohhhhhh no, futurama had the perfect ending. I hope they don't botch this.
I will never get tired of this show. Grew up with it and glad benders voice actor is still voicing him.
but why?
I hate that im gonna have to be skeptical cause the track record of stuff coming back and being as good as the original has been pretty terrible but it looks promising
Please leave Futurama alone :(
I am so excited
I’m not gonna lie folks, I have very low expectations
... sigh. So even the smarty simpson guys decided to use this media to introduce social constructs and tell their opinion... I guess entertainment is just timly dead as AI arrives.
Wouldn’t be funny if someone from the office or modern family guest star in this
God i hope this is better than their Comedy Central run
I'm glad some plot contrivance isnt resetting Fry and Leela's relationship for the millionth time.
Literally always hits. Cannot wait for more
🥲 YaY
Great. Waiting for King of The Hill too
Oh no, this isn't going to go well.
Finally
1:05 is that what people are called when they are briefs people
They're back baby...😁
nah.
I thought it wouldn't happen again but here we are gang😭😭😭😭😭 I'm gonna go play futurama on Xbox now.
We're so back bros!
AHHHHHH WOOOOOOOO
I'm glad that this show is coming back but I'm afraid of it being a cashgrab...
cant wait for the new king of the hill trailer
This is good news for everyone
Futurama is back for the 14th time.
This looks great!
Original run Futurama is one of the greatest shows of all time, reboot Futurama was hit-or-miss and probably ended with more misses than hits. I hate to say it people, but re-reboot has a looooot going against it and is probably gonna be the worst version... keep your expectations in check.
hopefully that wasn't Seymour getting eaten by Nibbler! (his previous ending was saddening enough!)
Ok.
It took us like a decade but we finally got another season <3
Me han hecho muy feliz con esta noticia. 🤩
After all these years, this show still makes me chuckle. Not disappointed by the trailer.
I like it when he ask for massage oil and Lela is like no that’s weird and fry say oh yeah that also weird haha good show one laugh is worth 100 smiles :)
Bender the first non binary character before it was the “it” thing
This looks like it will be good
I hope this revival doesn't focus on fry and leela's  relationship, the previous revival main plot was their ups and downs as a couple, the previous revival series finale gave them a proper resolution, would be smarter if fry and leela can remeber the events of the episode and continue as a healthy couple.  The show must focus again on their classic sci fi adventures
No way
I hope this show isn't "fixed" for modern audiences.
It literally warms my heart that Futurama is back.
Please be good.  Love Futurama so much.  X
0:17 The Time Machine
Wait what
GOOD NEWS EVERYONE!!!
This is he best show ever, I'm so glad its back! XD
Should've let it die
It comes out on my birthday 😃
FUTURAMA IS BACK BABY!!!!
Loved this show,. They really shouldn't have gone with a covid episode though. That's way to dated
EVERYONE IS HERE
I love this show so much. I’m glad it’s back, again.
Shut up Hulu, and take my money!
This doesn’t look horrible like every other remake that’s come out in the past 5 years. One can hope
YESSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!! oh, to shreds you say?
i remember watching this 10 years ago
Almost makes waiting though the last ten years bearable. As a meatbag.
It's about time!!
Point your fingers up ☝️to show respect for the people who didn’t make it to 2023 and see the revival 😢
I have mixed feelings about this, the last episode was a perfect ending for the show and it should not have come back. However because it's back, how do I feel about this trailer? I don't know how I feel about the topical current modern times humor, like their jokes about cryptocurrency or the pandemic. I think that's a little too on the nose, but some other jokes did seem actually funny
Good news, everyone!
Futurama:Our dead just exaggerated
🤨🤔😀🤯🥳🥳🥳 new season
Yes please
Uh oh
Ngl I have absolutely zero faith this will be any good, like every single other reboots in recent history.
Hearing about another Futurama season is like when your childhood molester comes back for more.
It looks the same
Praying for a King of the Hill announcement soon
To that last one, it's what you pay for service like that Leela. Give it a few years, and we'll get there. SMBC had a comic about it. We move ever closer to the oversoul.
Oh god it's trying to be culturally relevant, it's dead already 😓
Definitely a "Good News Everyone!"
0:46 zoidbergs eye is a little off
The first time I've seen an animated show's revival actually look identical to the old stuff.
i need to support this in my country aaaaaaa
YAY Amy and Scruffy are back too!
Nogla’s back!!!!!
Did this need to return?
Nice
The best show is returning 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉so happy 😃 futurama!!!!!!😊
Bender back baby.
There back baby and it's all hands on deck this time 😏
They're Back!!!!!
Honestly, I liked how this show had left off, especially with the cleverness of the time loop also being us rewatching the show. I'm not pessimistic about the new season, but I thought it had a fitting end already.
This either gonna be great like the series or be terrible like disenchantment after season 1
its supposed to be the future, the endless possible story lines they could come up with that are unique and original and fun, and the writers can only manage to come up with corona virus jokes, cripto currency jokes, alexa jokes, and cowboy jokes? REally?
I missed this show so much. I hope I has a crossover with disenchantment.
its so good the hear those words again "we're back baby"
Woooooo🎉 I live to see Futurama return once again 🤣 Welcome TO THE WORLD OF TOMORROW ‼️‼️‼️
Can we ever just let things rest in piece.....
“LETS GOOO ALREADY!!!”
My childhood completes!!!
Bender sounds different….
I used to watch this as a kid, can't believe it's back! Didnt know anything but it's a welcome surprise
As a Canadian, I hope it comes to Disney+, like the Orville did.  Also, I object to Nibbler eating that dog.
A long haired, white t-shirt wearing, popular YouTube man once said… “Woooooooooooo! Yeah baby!”
Time to rewatch the previous seasons first
This reminds me of the time Futurama was cancelled, but then brought back.
Thanks for making me rewatch all seasons again starting now
So glad they worked it out with DiMaggio. Would not have been the same without him. 😀
WHY IS THE LIP SYNCING SO OFF????
I mean, futurama is entertaining however, I sort of feel like it should've stayed finished.
my childhood show is back baby!
im here for seymore <3
WE'RE BACK BABY!!!! Hopefully for good this time!!!!!!!!!
Can't wait
I never thought this show will come back baby
Futurama is better than Simpsons -- it's Groening's best work.  And it's the original source of so many memes in meme culture, lending hard evidence to its beloved status by mainstream audiences, so I'll never understand why it's been cancelled multiple times.
Yes
YESSS!!! LETS GOOOOOOOOO!
YES
This is the greatest news I have heard and will hear this year
Is this real? In this reality? That just cured my depression
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH omg
Please....f...in please! No woke stuff!
I really hope they dont turn the show woke. Its happened with a lot of remakes, and sadly, it might happen with Futurama.
This show will never die, and I love that .😊
Futurama is back, baby!!!
GREAT, now I HAVE to buy a Hulu subscription 😭
let it die already.
Oh thank god
Ahhh finally. I can properly distract myself from my divorce.
seeing the political climate and what it's done to entertainment, I'm curious to see what this show does coming back.
I've been doing reruns for ever😭
I got into this show right after it was canceled the second time, and the CGI, 2D animation is still unbelievable! So glad it’s making another comeback
This has convinced me to get Hulu
katey sagal is wonderful <3 (leela)
🎉🎉🎉Thank God, the jokes, the tone, the self-referential comedy, and ESPECIALLY voice acting is all the same!🎉🎉🎉
❤
We're back baby! With blackjack AND hookers!
Looks like they agreed to John DiMaggio's demands. lol
Yay!
Don’t mind me. I’m just here leaving my mark for when this starts trending
The crypto and COVID jokes worry me a ton but otherwise it seems good
The way I sobbed when I heard that theme again!!! It’s been so long!!!
if this is a dream tell someone to keep me in the freezer
I hope it continues for another couple of years this is one of the best shows ever
Finally
Am I dreaming?
I'm going to need this to be a success. I don't think my heart can handle another cancellation.
considering how old shows and movies have been ruined with new additions, this wil either be good or bad no in between
omg I'm very excite!
Loved this show. Yes, Futurama is back! Again! 😄
WE BACK BABY
omg i cant wait and now to wait for koth revival
Nice 👌
I'm just hoping the awkward lip synching is because this is a preview trailer, and gets cleaned up for the shows themselves, they're normally amazing at that!
Futurama has left and come back more than Roman Reigns.
Hopefully its actually funny this time
Time to binge watch everything all over again
business as usual lol
I mean it looks the same
It's Alf! He's back! In Pog form!     no but really, I like futurama.
ITS BACK AGAIN??
Get ready for dissapointment
Yeeeeeeeesssssssssssssssss
Use to bother my Freshman roomate by just playing Fururama DvD's on constantly. Lets gooooo!
Can't wait! 🙂
This doesnt make sense the finale was perfect why bring it back
For goodness sake, let it die!!!
We’re back baby🔥🔥🔥
THANK GOODNESS IT'S STILL LOOKING GOOD!!
Yes. This. Yes.
Oh how I've missed you!!  🥰🥰🥰🥰
This has been needed for about 10 years or so now I'm so glad it's coming back, I was way too young to watch it when it came out I had to catch up when I got older and to see a new season is great I get to see the final beatles song and a new season of my fav show of Groening's trilogy this is the best year ever
but with the last ending the show was perfectly loopable
They Back Baby
disney plus right
Clearly, this'll do a better job a being a revival than Clone High Season 2 by a mile. And I couldn't be any happier.
I literally screamed out when i saw this
Are the cast of actors the same though?
FUTURAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesss
Didn’t they pay for 2 seasons? Think Bender gonna cause the most destruction this season
I guess with Futurama being on Hulu, it hopefully won't be massively censored and monitored like Gravity Falls.
I hope they do it right
Are Fry and Leela gonna be married here?
Imagine if they make another Anthology of Interest. I like to see “What if Disney never, even ever, existed.”.
Bender’s back baby
Hmm... this reality is very interesting
No idea if this is a Hulu exclusive or it’s on Disney+ too
Crazy The animation barely changed. I already know Fiona and cake is gonna looks crazy to me
oh myGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD YESSSS
AY LETS GOOOO
I mean hey! Welcome back! I’ll definitely be watching!
Where is this going to be in Australia because Australia doesn't have hulu and futurama is on disney+
from omicron persei 8
Welcome back Futurama!
Yeah definitely think they will be tasked with capturing robo santa and reprogramming him to be how he is supposed to be.
This better be good. You can't just wrap up a series perfectly and then years later decide you wanna milk it some more without these new episodes being flawless. I'm hopeful but very skeptical
I’m glad the animation looks normal 🎉
Would you futurama me? Id futurama me. Id futurama me so hard
Niiiiice!!!
The lip syncing is truly atrocious here.
Let’s go baby
Aaaaand the milking continues. The ending was great, the show was cancelled multiple times already. What's the point? Cheap nostalgia bait?
Futurama is back again ... again... again!
Brung back for ruination(Hopefully not).
More MCU & Star Wars Sequels References.
Wow, I’m in shock lol. I remember the day Futurama released it’s final episode on Comedy Central.  Actually come to think of it, does Comedy Central still exist???
Welcome Back!
Please don't disneyfy my favorite show. Please please please, Hollywood, just for once don't be Hollywood.
Let things end.
They are bringing it back after 10 years?!
Keeping milking it.
YAY! They didn't try to retcon Fry and Leela's marriage!
I am EXCITED!
You're kidding me. And here I was getting used to Futurama being stuck in a time loop.
You think they'll make a reference of the Simpson crossover they did?
can't believe they even entertained doing this without John DiMaggio..what a blunder that woulda been.
I’m hoping this season is good, but, of course, it HAS to have a covid episode and crypto episode(s) just because.
omg i cant wait
I really hope they can capture the heart the original show had
A little disappointed that the future is modern day now like every other show.
This show had a really good ending from my memory, but the return is exciting
Yeaaaaaaaahhhh❤
Whoaaaa just like 24 years ago
Stale Covid and crypto jokes I see 🙄
SWEET RE-ENTRY TO THE THIRTY FIRST CENTURY! 😃
Hoping they don't rely too much on "current events"
10 years everyone
I'm so happy they kept the original animation style. It feels like when I was younger again :)
Let’s gooooooo!!!!!
Is it just me, or is that not the original voice for bender?
Lmdao 🤣🤣🤣 “sorry guys I’m a flatty”
I missed out watching this show during my childhood days but now, I am planning on watching everything in one sitting (or at least 1-2 seasons per day) soon.
Hulu needs to start releasing whatever theme remixes they make for these reboot trailers. First Animaniacs, now this? I mean cmon
Seems 2023 is turning around for the better!
I was born in the year 3,000 and I still watch Futurama
Meh 🫤 looks corny
It’s back!
Let's go already!
I'm disappointed that the newer episodes are only available for Hulu 😢
They're back, again
I dunno, it had such a good ending the last time.
1:20: Bender's famous quote
I’m just hoping we FINALLY get an answer to what Nibbler meant when he called Leela “the other” back in the original run of the series.
Having the trailer for Futurama come out after FNAF's was such a bold move.
i mean i like the show but just let it die already man its gone through 3 cancellations and the show had a good ending.
Lela finds Alexa creepy but doesn’t fine advertisements and dreams creepy?
Bit sceptical, but holding out hope.
LETSGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
The one series that can get away having 5 different endings
Надеюсь, будут не только просто смешные серии, но и грустные
😭😭😭😭😭❤❤❤❤❤😊
I'd love to see another Simpsons and Futurama crossover
I’ve gone to sleep with Futurama since I was 17. I cannot overstate how excited I am for this.
Wow they just willed more futurama into existence, just like Comedy Central, and Fox also once did
I’m guessing it’s coming to Disney+ in the UK?🇬🇧
I loved the original run of Futurama but I'm somewhat worried about this revival. Hopefully they're faithful to what made Futurama as amazing as it was and don't do what a lot of modern cartoon shows have been doing.
Futurama is back baby
This is good news indeed
I hope this is good.  Hey Hulu! Where are the last four episode of Tengoku daimakyô in English???  I would like to finish the season already.
already dated and it’s not even out yet
Words cannot describe how ecstatic I am about this😁
Yes!!!!
I really liked it back then and was sad when they cancelled it. Hope the show it's not just about our nostalgia and the showrunners have a lot of good stories to tell...
Just please don't split the gang up again, so many modern shows have been doing this now.. everyone trapped in their own little subplots
this looks like the simpsons
it is back it has been so long
Every time I saw Futurama, I remind a first episode and feel sad for the dog 🐶
I'm not too keen on a covid episode... We already got the common cold one so they've done the whole sickness and quarantine bit. I just want to move on
poor animation, bad color scheme, no "soul"
remember when they used to be a delivery company?
lol im hyped!
"I deserve that?" Where is the real Bender?
Will it be too topical? That remains to be seen.
Futurama returning with a new season is like finding an unopened bottle of your favorite drink during terrible weather.
i want to be positive but the new digitality of the art style is kind of off, same in all the content after the original cancellation. The lines are... too clean? I won't pretend to know the ins and the outs as I am not an artist, but it's like seeing a really excellent wax museum model of an old friend.
They're back, baby!
NO WAY!11!1!1!1 🤯🥶🥶🤯🥶🤯🥶🤯
Fnaf better
I've never been so excited to see all the cast back together and a new season! cannot wait!
As long as they dont split apart Fry and Leela, I will thoroughly enjoy this revival!
I can't wait to watch it.
How did they get out of that Time Loop in the old Series Finale?
Let’s go Futurama might be the most underrated show ever.
Yay, and I just finished watched all the seasons. Might go again
This looks good
The fact that it’s exactly the same animation amazing
That sure does sound like more Futurama alright.
Amazin!
People often talk about how Simpsons should’ve quit in it’s prime. Did they ever stop to think maybe Futurma did exactly that but now it’s coming back to ruin it?
no way i though the show end it years ago . now its back oh joi my chilled hood
Fingers crossed they don't ruin the beautiful relationships
Undisputed King of Comebacks.
I loved watching this show as a kid. It was hilarious but had some really sad moments as well .
How long do you think it'll take @johnny2cellos to make a video breaking this down?😂
We're back, baby!
Yes.
At last there back baby
"It just won't stay dead."
no way...
I just remembered they were bringing this back like an hour ago and I was wondering when they were gonna put a trailer out 😂
I'm so scarerd. Futurama had the perfect ending. Is not like I don't love futurama, I'm scared is in its way to get ruin by greedy.
First smosh is back now Futurama, Its like gods answering all my prayers
The show that just won't die.
We went from the Animaniacs reboot to a new season of Futurama. Hulu sure knows how to step up their Animation Game.
I hope it doesn’t lose its magic like The Simpsons, but from this footage it looks pretty funny though 👍🏻
I almost forgot that finale with the tine altering button
Hmmmm, after Clone high being weighed down so much by modernising it, the most I can have is VERY CAUTIOUS enthusiasm with mentions of the you-know-what and crypto.
I've never cared about a show returning until now.
It looks like very funny. I willl watch It.
Best thing to happen this year
Can’t wait for people to complain it’s not as good as the previous seasons and being another pointless reboot
futurama is never truly canceled just in a state of dormancy
We need something new, not the same stuff re-hashed and ruined.
I really hope they don’t mess this up lol the simpsons has really gone downhill so I’m afraid it will
mid
I can't wait for new YouTube videos that will be about Futurama predicting the future.
I prefer if the Simpsons constantly got cancelled and this show just kept going on.
Yup. Can't wait
wish the characters had aged
Futurama: "You won't let me live. You won't let me die."  Hulu: "The world needs you."
As soon as I saw the worms, I know Johnny 2 Cellos is gonna have a field day with this trailer
YEAH! 🎉
when hulu brings revivals they usually do it well and loyal to the original series which is exactly this trailer shows, can't wait for this to come out.
YES! FINALLY! I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG FOR THIS AMAZING SHOW TO RETURN
Futurama ended with season 4
They say the Simpson’s will never die but futurama is the real survivor after 2 cancellations!
don't get me wrong, this is a good thing, but the time stop ending was so good, why ruin it? although futurama has been brought back multiple times before...
Futurama is basically one of the best cartoons that Matt Groening has ever created.
This is going to be so good! :D
yay more zoidberg
So happy they didn’t recast John as bender, absolutely wouldn’t of been the same without him
I thought it ended?
King of the hills next
AAAAAHHHH I CAN'T WAIT 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Futurama has somehow managed to be only kind of funny for twenty years.
Im glad that everyone in the show sounds the exact same so far. I was kinda expecting a Clone High situation where everyone sounded a bit off.
Im so fuggin excited ❤
Bender's new voice actor sounds different. I'll try to get used to it, but
Hey, bender. Hey, bender. You wanna try these tenders?
Can’t wait
😮♥️
I see the positive comments but,I'm not happy with this,it already ended with a good made ending,it took it time and finished,it told its story,even if people are hyped I dont think this will turn well in the end,it wil not reach the high of before..............I dont know mate I think I dont want more stuff that already ended as it can ruin what we got,its cool we getting more stuff but how long until its enough,we cannot just bring back everything.
I LOVE THEM I LOVE THEM I LOVE THEM
*WELCOME BACK FUTURAMA!!*
This show is so goated. Im glad its back.
LET IT DIE!!! IT HAD A GOOD ENDING PLEASE DONT RUIN THIS
Let’s go
minster beast
this looks horrible.
Uhh.. hopefully its not politically modernized- nevermind I just reached the virus part of the video
oh wow covid and crypto im so surprised
This made me happy
This is amazing. Favorite animated tv show by a mile
My binge has increased another season.   Yes!
WE BACK !!! 🗣️
Ohhhh yeah.
I'm just excited that Futurama is back again 😁
Heck yeah! Super stoked to check it out.
2023 IS WILD 🔥🔥🔥
Wow they sound old now huh?
I don’t know how to feel about this. I thought the last episode was a great ending for them but I’m so happy to see them return
WE'RE BACK BABY
Cant WAIT!!
0:17 isn’t that professors forwards time machine?
*Me:* So, while this trailer is basically awesome, when are we gonna get another season of Disenchantment on Net-  * Bender holds up ray gun to my face *  *Bender:* WE’RE coming back FIRST, meatbag. 😡
I had a smile on my face for the entire trailer. Bender's escape killed me. This is Futurama alright. And I'm so happy to see it back.
Their back baby
Once more unto the breach dear friends, once more
Will Leela and Fry finally go stead? Or will they all die on another planet my guess both.
feels like they never go away
ура жду оч 10/10
GOOD NEWS EVERYONE!
I’m excited for Futurama’s third run.
Also love to see more of my OTP Fryla ❤️
The show that always comes back.
*WE'RE BACK BABAY*
Yay!
This makes me so happy.
And it's already got dated references...
Well, at least the voice acting and animation is still spot on as if nothing has changed!
I'm confused is this the same timeline refers scene and grew up in the show or the new timeline because of the modern-day era
Never knew Futurama would ever return
We're back baby!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Futurama Is Back Again After 10 Years Of Waiting, The Planet Express Crew Are Back In Business Once Again, I Can't Wait For The New Episodes To Come Out And I'm So Excited For The Planet Express Crew's New Adventures In The New Season Of The Show! Come On, Baby. Let's Go Party Already For The Comeback Season! 🥳🎉
0:50 Crypto Country?! I love this
Trailers are just always so bad huh?
It's interesting that the technology of the future of Futurama only ever advances when our technology IRL does.
Finally
0:35 OF COURSE THEY DID AN EPISODE ABOUT COVID 😆❤️
Zoidberg doesn't sound great. All of the other characters still have the old energy to them however.  As for the trailer as a whole? That COVID episode looks pretty lame (I'm getting pretty sick of it being a plotline in so many shows), but the rest is still okay. Trailers usually aren't well-representative of how funny or not something's going to be.  The show didn't *need* to be brought back again, so let's hope it still works.
got the date on my calendar set, will be buying hulu just for futurama and not pirate it just because i want to support the show much as possible 😄
In the words of a great robot.  "We're back baby!"
One of the best series! Thanks you for bringing back Fry, Bender, Leela and the crew that we love !!!
My only hope is that Zoidberg's girlfriend stays in the show. Let the man be happy!
This show is so fun to watch!
Have no fears, we got stories for years 😁
This will be epic with a ton of fun!!! I am looking forward to see Futurama again!
Looks exactly like good old Futurama. Can’t wait!
The writers and actors never fail to land a joke. I’m excited.
no way this is happening 😲
Omg one of my favorite cartoon tv show is back let's go wooo can't wait.
Good news for everyone!!!
I hope they have forever show then the simpsons or south park. Please don't canceled this show if not something own fault.
Hearing Bender’s voice again gave me the biggest nostalgia rush I’ve ever had
lets goooo
I'm just glad they're not resetting the Characters, I had enough of Fry and Leela's will they won't they storyline
hello old friends
Imagine if they make another Anthology of Interest. I like to see “What if Disney never, even _ever,_ existed.”.
Missed them, support them for more seasons!!!
FINALLY!!!!🤩🤩🤩🤩  After all these years, and since Disney had been acquired on 20th Century Studios from the very beginning, FUTURAMA IS BACK!!!  And they headed into a new home of Hulu!!!! So, I can't wait for see a Hulu original limited series, "FUTURAMA": the first season of the revival/rebooted series, which is streaming exclusively on Hulu on the next month, which is part of the Disney 100 Years of Wonder celebration!!!  This time, the CRAZY adventures is gone WILD!!! Welcome back to a new home of Hulu, Bender and friends!!! And a Happy anniversary, Disney, Hulu and FUTURAMA!!!
Do a flip!
Same day as the Venture Bros. movie. Despite being well ito my thirties, I really am going to spend all day watching cartoons
BEST COMBACK EVER!  It's all like in Original! THANKS!
Yes! Oh gawd yes! We want snoo-snoo!!!
The OG Rick and Morty
Жаль, озвучки не будет..
YES!
Aaaaaahhhhh Futurama!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Borax Kid? I’m in.
Whyyyy Like I love Futurama, but I thought it ended at a great place
It's been 10 years since the show is canceled
I'm going to build my own theme park with blackjack and hookers.
0:43 to himself or to his patients
I hope for Leela turn into a Giantess
great mate
We’re back indeed baby!
July boutta be lit
Yessssssss
YAY!
WE'RE BACK BABEH!
We’ll When I was Born in 1999 I watched When I was little Now I’m Grew Up Like a adult.
Futurama being cancelled and returns is the most Futurama thing I've ever Futurama'd. And now again. THIS SHOW is just 🚀👾🤖
Heck yeah! This is going to be awesome.
NiCe
this makes me happy
I wonder if this will tie in to Disenchantment Part 5
Pero el doblaje en español existe?
So they’re gonna talk about the new stuff that happened after they got canceled like coronavirus or AI or new celebrities in jar
Now this is the Futurama I was hoping to see again! The humor hasn’t changed at all and still makes me laugh to this day! Very excited to finally have a new season! 🎉🎊
I never thought Futurama would come back. So glad I was wrong.
They're back baby!
We will be watching 👀
I’m excited for this but why do the voices sound weird?
So, is it July 24 or 26? I hope it comes out on Blu-Ray after the episodes finish airing.
After 10 Years!!
Yes
Rest in peace to the fans who didnt make it to be able to watch this revival 🥺. I wish my best friend was here to binge the new season with me.
I'm only on season 3. Time to binge!
Cool
After so long, having Futurama return is the best thing ever.
They're Back,Baby  More Good News Than Good News Everyone!!! Full Of Future surprises Of real Future surprises
Another certified neighborhood classic!
