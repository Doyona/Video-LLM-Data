11:17 Very long-term but yes 💀
11:22 he will now that Hamilton's replacing him
11:25 big fat L talking about Sainz :D
Why did Kimi Raikkonen come up as Kimber Raccoon in my subtitles 😂😂😂
It’s insane how much he grew from last year
Daniel kvyat im so triggered he's called daniil kvyat
3:37-4:25 I have no idea that your talking about Tommo its 2021 now
3:39 my new ringtone
Tommo mate you have to related to Liam payne from one direction
watching you physically cringe at your prediction on alex LMAOOO i can see the pain in your eyes
Finally!! YouTube recommended me a good channel
If George hadn't gone to Mercedes he'd of been p20
lol how can anybody take you seriously after you predict that Hamilton won't win a title...LOL...where have you been last 15 years?
Why people fucking always forget that the SF1000 has been the shittiest Ferrari F1 car in recent times?
Bold of Tommo to assume Max will win with the RB16 fighting the monstrous W11
13:09 str8 up cringe moment for me to the 2019 Tommo and obviously you cringed to in your reaction 😂
Irish guy is having a mare looking at these predictions
My man
Giovinazzi: YT Auto CC: Jovan Nancy                        Joe Venati                        Joe Vanessa
Bad predictor. This is totally useless.
Bro every year video you defend Ocon and Ricciardo...
Hahahahahahaha very funny
The Albon part🤣
#bringalbonback!
I've been hoping other F1 youtubers would do this! Seen 2021 predictions, but no looking back at 2020 predictions
Tommo before the 2020 season: Says the biggest surprise of the season will be Alex Everyone: Full marks for how bad he was!
How tf can you compare Sebastian Vettel to Albon, Albon is bloody dreadful
What with hulk?😂🤫
Just the thing I needed after this day in home office to make it a bit better. Formula video + listening to the music I like (Delta Parole, Metallica and other) make me feel the speed and excitement!
U underestimate Pérez a lot
That’s crazy I just watch you for a year
😂 😂 Predictions were really good until you got to the top 7 or 8 places. Verstappen P1 was BOLD!
Any idiot could’ve got 3 correct- hamilton p1- bottas p2 ( basically Mercedes 1-2 even tho bottas is crap but that superior piece of machinery makes up for it) and last and also the least latifi p20. Peace.
Te dejaste llevar mucho por los resultados del 2019 ya que RP no fue muy bueno pero con el gran cambio respondieron bien veo que a checo no le tienes mucha confianza para 2021 lo colocas 5 abajo de richardo saludos
You should start predicting the lotery numbers :))
Mclaren ... ZzZzZzzZZZZ booring
Bye bye Alex, sorry mate but he just ain’t it
perez took the red bull seat
Your predictions are poor. Not very realistic.
i kinda felt Latifi was quite solid overall.
Good vid
*Lewis will finish second* Sir alex hamilton: hold my wine
Tommo this video is hilarious 😂😂
2:03 this didn’t age well   Edit: the way he just doesn’t stop talking and keeps praising him just hurts 😂
Liam Payne if he did formula 1 instead of music
That vettel prediction is harsh but the reality is even more harsh
Dude is a Liam Payne doppelgänger
Loved those reactions 😂
When Mercedes finally confirms Hamilton in the other Mercedes how about a reaction to your 2021 Driver Line Up vid?
when someone pronounces 'daniil' like 'daniel' so i think they're talking about danny rick.
2:00 that had me crying i was literally dying inside
Bottom 10: Absolutely fantastic, just got the order slightly mixed up by a place or 2. Top 10: YOU SPIN ME RIGHT ROUND BABY RIGHT ROUND LIKE A RECORD BABY ROUND ROUND ROUND
Hi xo
I mean you got really close in your predictions but the further up the list the less accurate they were. No way of predicting the pink Mercedes performance, Renault discovery of sweet spot of the car, and ferrari shit box whit wheel (on past standards of)
In my opinion Latifi wasnt that bad
the amount of effort into the editing of every video is insane congrats on the year tommo
I think gassy is overrated
“Look at his stupid face” 😂
The ones with Albon made me cringe so hard
At this point saying anyone other than Hamilton will win the title is a hope rather than a prediction
“Max should have beat botas but he had tire problems” botas who had tire problems and probably but in his worse season ever 😂
Crazy how Sainz and Norris had such a close battle the whole season but they remained great friends throughout
So painful to see the flop of Seb and the leave of Alex from F1 T^T
I'm disappointed that you thought that Gio would beat the ice man
Me too prepared a comparison chart based on your prediction before this video. Please compare 2021 contract prediction result after Lewis Hamilton announces his future plan.
Captions: bloody red ball seat   Me: bro ur balls ok?
Unless ur thai whats there to like about albon? Like a watered down Norris
“I think Mercedes will take their foot off a little bit.” Tommo 2019
it’s always fun to look back like that ;).   please check out my 2020 F1 season review video here - https://youtube.com/watch?v=9P_-njRsngs&feature=share  thank you 🙏🏻 & happy holidays:)
How is most improved not perez Perez is killing it i thought that you said "well, i wasnt a million miles off" cuz stroll is on the same team as sergio
Biggest Rivalry,  Vettel Vs Ferrari Vettel Vs His Chief Mechanic Vettel Vs Ferrari Strategy Vettel Vs Mattia Binotto
I predicted Hamilton champion, it's easy to predict
The fact that you thought there was any chance that Merc would not be P1 is not great, mate.
I miss the hat
Next season bottas will suffer a "2020 vettel"
This video aged like a cheese stick
Stumbled upon this... What a video!!  Subscribed, Tommo. 😀👍🏼
I think Max will never win a world title
5:45 well that wording aged well didn't it...
Poor seb
tommo pls have a look to your video of 2021 seats that you did at the beginning of the year
Classic youtuber predition every year: Max will be champion, Hamilton 2nd. Lewis every year: WC by 100+ points Lol. Cant wait for next year Max will be champ prediciton :D
This hurt.
To be fair...
Tommo,  I think Mercedes had more DNFs than RedBull and the majority of bad luck and DNFs on the Mercedes side hurt Bottas
Ooh, and with Alex being replaced... yeah that hurts. What mic do you use?
Russel points were gifted to him by the FIA he s still 0 points.
Ur a cabbage lol
First vid i see of you look like a guy with a good F1 brain
didnt realise it was a year already.Gratz on everything :)
7:08 bro, i felt that 💔🤧😂
Sounds bunged up Tommo, get yourself a test son and isolated 😂
w8 for 2021 predicts
Biggest Rivalry: Norris and Stroll
Waiting for the 2021 predictionss!!
Giovinazzi: Giovinazzi.  YouTube: Jovan Nancy, Joe Venati, Joe Vanessa.
Ur only nice to grosjean because of the crash
That vid was made on my birthday lol
Bottas , Ricciardo and Checo are sharpening knives on a Zoom call where they mentioned your name Tommo.
"max making some mistakes and being a bit impatient" you mean the Turkish gp? All of the other races he finished on the podium. With mercedes basically always having the best car thats a big accomplishment. The only dnf that was really his fault and can still be excused somewhat was the gravel that looked like tarmac in sakhir.
Ah yes the mercedes duo; Bo'as and Hamilon
That Albon prediction and your reaction though, funniest shit ever
Nice job
Watching this after the redbull announcement is PAINFUL
to be fair, seb didnt drive the best... but whenever he was doing well he was screwed by his pit crew or race strategy
what a nice video
Sergio BLOODY Perez Me , a Mexican on who loves English accent.🥲😲🥵
this is the first time in my life that im oooooooffing this much in 15is minute video, it realy tell how bonker this f1 season is
Max made 1 mistake... in Turkey. Otherwise he was always on the podium. It isn’t because of Turkey he is third it is because of the dnf’s which weren’t his fault
14:25  Bottas: Oh yea no one else has had tyre failures...
I can't wait for next year
Max making some mistakes? He only made one huge mistake and that was Turkey. 5 DNF's because of other reasons. Verstappen had a very, very consistent season.
If you do this for next year, you gotta do it after testing for accuracy I guess
5:39 26*
Can’t believe it’s been a year
How do you still have F1 in your name? I thought Liberty Media was making all F1 youtubers remove the F1 in their names.
Checo is going to struggle like any other number 2 RB driver
Thinking about it, predicting Max in P1 and Albon in P4 over Lewis in P2 and Bottas in P5, was a bit out there when considering how far Mercedes have been in the constructors' championships since hybrid era.
Haha I remember this video was what made me subscribe to you
Tommo what is your microphone and headset set up? The audio in all of your videos is superb!   Also, I feel you about Alex, but as a Mexican we may just have a Mexican Champion with redbull 🙃 or I can wish 😅
Great video as always
unsub
I've never seen your videos but fun breakdown; however, it's really a sticking point this one.  It's not "what Lewis does" it's what that car does.  Merc has an obscene grip on P1 and having a driver like him just clinches it.  Lewis is a top 10 or 15 driver of all time and on the back of that car that's all you need in this over-regulated era to become a dynasty.  Ask the New England Patriots.
In Latifi's defence, if Russell didn't get that Mercedes drive at Sakhir he would've finished ahead of George with 3 11th place finishes to 1 11th place finish.
You do know you can in the middle of the video to pause and continue, right? =P Nice predictions there mate
P5 Bottas? Lmao you know nothing about about F1 sorry
You owuld get Russell right if not the mercedes race lol
To be fair, Grosjean did steal a living in that Haas car
I think you nailed the most improved driver, pre 2020 lancelot was dogshit, this year he wasnt that bad, looked like a decent midfield driver in a decent number of races
This aged really well after Perez was confirmed for RedBull instead of Albon
Not too bad. At least the first half of the video 😜
Your boi alex has been kicked out 😅
Love the vids man!! That was the video that made me subscribed and watched everyone since 😂only got 5 positions correct on my predictions 😂 looking forward to your 2021 predictions!
2:10 - Perez taking over the seat. Lmao
who's here after red bull announced perez for 2021
FFFFFFFFFFFF..........
F in chat for Alex
I’ve heard that you’re extremely annoying and this is actually the first video I’ve seen of you... yep you’re extremely annoying!
start the live stream tommo... RB just announced CHECO
It's a real shame, I think Albon has the talent to be a great driver, just not at red bull. They've clearly built the team around max, and just need a solid number 2,not someone who is looking to make their name in the sport. I think Albon would do well at a team like Renault-experienced team mate, car capable of decent results
Why are you hating on seb that much... ferrari screwed him over woth strategies and the car doesn't suit him AT ALL, yall are all the same, fucking Lewis fans, boring new F1 fans wow
Yay, that's the video that made me subscribe! Glad to see this channel growing, you totally deserve it, especially with your editing skills, you videos are so esthetically pleasing.
Latifi would have been P19 if not for Russell getting the call to Mercedes
Of all the races Max and Valterri finished, Max beat Valterri by 6-4. The defining factor was *the car.*
You should chop the grid into Q1 Q2 and Q3 to see how accurate the ballpark predictions are, along with positions.
Biggest Suprise Driver: España without the S
I’d of been terribly wrong too, shame for seb this season. Poor show from the scudaria :(. This season I developed some(a lot) of love for Lando though the lad is a funny guy
For biggest flop, I'd like to nominate Daniil Kvyat, especially compared to Gasly.
Tommo F1 you should do a F1 2020 career mode
Been here since before you hit 1k
Idk if u guys do this for sports in the UK and Europe, but in the US, we do “way too early” predictions right after the season ends. Would be interesting to see how your thoughts on 2021 would change between now and March.
to be fair we must admit that Bottas had a lot of bad luck as well...
Am I the only one who thinks Tommo sounds like Alfie from the peaky blinders at times?
Who is this guy? Is he a racing driver?
Better do a 2021 prediction
Half a W is a V which stands for victory 😎
*PAIN*
Minutes of waffle
Just so u know, if u exclude russels points hes P20 cuz Latifi finished multiple times P11
Awww my heart broke when you said that about perez. Haha but I may be bias bc I’m mexican.
Hey tommo love the vids what camera do u use?
Tommo “I quite accurately estimated the performance of the Alfa Romeo”  Also Tommo “I kind of overestimated the Alfa Romeo”
Your videos always keep me entertained during my breaks in my lorry, Looking forward to many many more!!
pretty sure alex keeps his seat
the kitchen was great (:
5:15 STOP THE COUNT
If Perez is announced I don’t think Alex will get another chance at F1 tbh
This was hysterical 😂😂😂😂😂 the end really slapped 😂😂😂😂
Sorry for you Tommo, but in RedBull i want to see Perez, not Albon
Well if Russel didn't score the points, he would've been P20. That's because Latifi did finish in p11/p12 more frequently  Edit: If only the original 20 drivers would've driven
Just wondering, why can't Nico Hulkenberg and Sergio Perez get picked up by an F2 team?
I actually remember the rich energy video!!!! Wow, such a throwback...
Not to split hairs, but Riccardio and Ocon would be an intra-team rivalry not an inter-team rivalry. This was a great video mate, I love that you have gone back to reflect on your predictions. Makes me want to write my predictions for next year so I can look back at them next December and laugh at myself!
Looking forward to 2021 predictions given this 2020 season!
Why all the Vettel hate.. It's just a bot irritating flaming him that much
Got a misguided ad before this, fairly fitting
5:43 26 points *
HAHA Brilliant, this should be a yearly segment. Just show's how much the editing and quality of the channel has improved in one year.
Russell was actually P20 before the Mercedes move!
Imagine if Hamilton doesn't sign with Mercedes
You're seriously defending that Ocon and Ricciardo had any team rivalry whatsoever!?! FFS
Starts 1:10 Cringing starts 1:11
I think we need some girls to rate the f1 drivers based solely on how their looks idk why. I just think it would be an interesting video 😂
Your editing and video layout was pretty great here! Keep it up man, I’m glad this channel didn’t end
So what, that’s a net total of +6 I think? I’m bad at math, but that doesn’t seem that terrible when you are exclusively looking at the accuracy of the drivers overall.
That beard tho
Mate the prediction about seb were not at all accurate😂😂 You made me angry when I saw that video last year because I am a seb fan 😁😁 No one could have imagined ferrari doing so bad  Any plans for a video on 2021 season after all the drivers are confirmed?
My early prediction on Nikita Mazepin of Haas F1 is P20 and becomes another version of Pastor Maldonado
You already predicted vettel was going to do bad, and he just did even worse
R.I.P torpedo’s 2021 seat. We will always remember him
I watched this yesterday hoping u would react to this
Yeah, pretty good. Scrambled by Ferrari being so utterly disastrous, Renault getting kinda good, and Merc being absolute beasts.
Can’t wait to see the 21’ predictions
To be fair, Lance had horrible luck in the second half of the season, made very few mistakes this year (still some, but not many) I’d say he’d be top 3 most improved
It doesn’t feel that long since I found your video on rokit. I remember it having like 50 views when I watched it and I was surprised then how a guy with such good videos had so little subs
You've aged like 3 years in 1 year
am i og if i have been subbed for about year now
Lando foreva!
My 2021 predictions (just so I can laugh at them a year later like you did):  1. Hamilton 2. Verstappen 3. Ricciardo 4. Perez 5. Bottas 6. Lando 7. Vettel 8. Leclerc 9. Sainz 10. Stroll 11. Alonso 12. Gasly 13. Ocon 14. Tsunoda 15. Russel 16. Mick Schumacher 17. Kimi  18. Antonio  19. Latifi 20. Mazepin  1. Red Bull 2. Mercedes 3. McLaren 4. Aston Martin 5. Ferrari 6. Renault 7. Alpha Tauri 8. Alfa Romeo 9. Haas  10. Williams
pre:Covide Tommo: IS VETTELS CAREER OVER??!
Tommo: Perez is throughly underrated Also Tommo: Throughly underrates him
was a bit too pessimistic about perez, that man is an absolute beast and smashed it this year (still rate hulk and wish him the best but one has to acknowledge his performance)
biggest surprise made me cry. he was the biggest surprise tbh. i love Alex, but he wasn't great this season ... i've loved his racing since i first saw him drive back in F2 2018
Bro!! Another bangin video! great job man, this type of video is your bread and butter.  Perfectly in your wheel house! Super funny, can't wait for your 21' predictions!!
Proud to see how it's all planned out bud!
As an a Albon fan I'm in Spain without the S.
Biggest surprise is Albon. He was soo bad
Biggest Rivalry: Vettel and his car
Mad how long ago that was already, feels weird
4:53 you dont look any different mate
Tbh, I made some crazy predictions with a friend, 3 drivers would catch covid, no podiums for Albon, and something else but I think it was related to Ferrari slipping down or something
Wtf i didnt know you are over 110000+ subscribers when I checked it the last time you had 10K
TOMMO are you on to much juice max beats ham!!!!!!!
New title: I'm sorry I'm dumb
That aged like a piece of camembert.
It’s kinda strange that the one that was most off was Vettel.
Inter is not the same as intra. You mean intra-team rivalry. Great vid, tho!
If you had excluded the points Russell scored in the Merc he would've finished 20th, behind Latifi
Poor Max will get slapped by George for the rest of his career...! Will propablly get to more race wins than Seb, but no championships...
Great vid
Latifi would be P19 if Russel stayed at Williams in Bahrain.🤨
Would love to see Albon get another go next year. Only 17 races this year and Red Bull's head is all about replacing him. Just like Gasly last year. Give the taurine a pause perhaps.
Why does everyone hate on latifi? Hes a rookie in a William's going up against someone who is arguably better than lewis
Pretty sure you did much better than CrankyYankee. TBH I always thought you had Ricciardo and Bottas wrong. But all in all not bad for pre Covid predictions.
"I thought there would be three teams battling for wins"  Well, you were wrong in the sense that it wasn't Mercedes vs. Ferrari vs. Red Bull, however... four teams actually won races, which is the most of the turbo-hybrid era!
whole lotta pain in that second prediction.
This is pure gold. I was an OG watching the vid when you had mere 100 Subs or something. I wonder: Do you think your channel exploded because of the Orange army and you putting max P1? What’s your demographic saying?
Hair looking neat buddy!
Nice video
Uploads a couple hours ago talking about how Tsunoda will probably get Kyvat’s seat. Literally right after, F1 announces that he gets his seat.
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OTHER INTRO???
Proper nostalgia trip this one Tommo. Been around since this video, great seeing where you are now just 12 months later
I CRACKED when the Albon part started
13:26 We all in Mexico ask for the same...
That video was half wine and half milk.
5:15 if it wasn’t for George racing for merc latifiwould of finished ahead
How funny would it have been if he had painted on a clown face at the end 😂
My own wild 2021 predictions: P1. Max Verstappen P2. Lewis Hamilton P3. Sergio Perez (Red Bull)  P4. Valtteri Bottas P5. Daniel Ricciardo P6. Fernando Alonso P7. Charles Leclerc P8. Carlos Sainz P9. Lando Norris P10. Esteban Ocon P11. Pierre Gasly P12. Sebastian Vettel P13. Lance Stroll P14. Yuki Tsunoda P15. George Russell P16. Mick Schumacher P17. Antonio Giovinazzi P18. Kimi Raikkonen P19. Nicholas Latifi P20. Nikita Mazepin
#announceminton 🐶
Og gang😎😎
Do you watch F1 im not to sure lololol
damn been watching for a while now much love tommo
14:18 Tommo bouncing a basketball in the background?
And they still haven't announced the damn Red Bull seat
i am so happy to be at the start of this channel I honestly was like this channel is so good it deserved more and now i am happy to see him where his is and i hope he grows more
Been here sinde the First 1k
The gap between Kimi and Antonio both got 4PTS. I think.
Tommo calling tommo stupid absolute class
Oh god, Tommo WHAT ARE U DOING?! Why were u wearing your hat backwards?
Hopefully Red Bull can take the fight to Merc next year (with whoever they sign)
I watched the original lmao, that aged pretty well
Biggest rivalry has to be stroll and Perez them 2 secretly despise each other
Remember sitting and watching it thinking: who the fuck is this guy
To be honest, Alex Albon was biggest surprise, just not in a good way
Great video very funny
it's interesting to do reaction to prediction!
first of your vids i ever watched <3
You can have any opinion you want about Seb, and blame whatever you want to for his terrible year, I can’t stop you, but it’s definitely not about kids. Checo has a son and look at him. I hate when “oh he has a kid, he can’t perform anymore” argument shows up because people forget he’s the only driver to ever challenge Mercedes dominance in much inferior cars WHILE he had two kids. I have my own opinions about his year at Ferrari and hearing about what he and the many people have said in the media, I know I got a lot of things spot on, but you can have yours and I won’t be offended at all. But the kid argument, trash it, because it’s stupid and it is infuriating. (Also, Max technically has a step kid too now(she’s Daniil’s daughter), ik I’m taking a long shot there but Kelly is his girlfriend😂)
nice video. i am hyped for 2021. will you do a predictions video for 2021?
Great content as always! Would never have known you've only been uploading F1 content for a year!
Pro tip. jump to 5:00
i forgot how bold you were... well done sir
4:51 "Look at him. Look at his stupid face." ROFL
I think these were actually really good predictions given no one could predict how good Racing Point will be and how bad Ferrari would be. Mercedes was a blunder from your part though.
Hey so glad to see you above 100k I remember when u barely had 5k subs
red bull just announced minton
LOL we really thought vetted was going to do well
But Gasly got podium in 2019 with Toro Rosso (Brazil)
Well nobody could have predicted anything that was gonna happen this year, but still some of your predictions were spot on  Waiting for the 2021 predictions video
All I know is that dts this season is about to be a banger
Russell would've finished P20 if not the Mercedes points. It's because Latifi was P11 3 times.
Ahh the kitchen how can we forget
#announceminton
Remember that I laughed at you when you said verstappen was going to win the championship. Hahahahahahaha
Honestly you can’t get mad at where Tommo placed Albon when in 2019 he finished in p4 or p5 in every race with Redbull, his only race he didn’t score points in was the Brazil race where he would’ve gotten a podium
That aged like a used BMW’s reliability xD Tbf you got a few things right, like Stroll for most improved driver (he had a good first half) and Seb for biggest flop.   Here’s a video suggestion: Now that it’s confirmed who 2021’s rookies will be, a video going over their careers thus far and who you think will do better in F1, would be nice.
It's entirely possible that Tommo's prediction that the driver who finishes P4 in the standings will drive for Red Bull in 2021 lol
Eagerly waiting for your 2021 predictions since you did pretty well considering 2020 have totally been a wild year.
If Mercedes didn't let Russell a chance he would not be P19 he would've been P20 because Latifi got more P11 than Russell
Interesting thing is if Russel didn't get the Merc race then he would have finished behind latifi in the standings
I was one of those OG subs.
Pogging through the pain
The pain in your face listening to your past self talking about Albon finishing P4.  Ouch.
I think this season was the last chance for Albon. His race pace is top 10, but you can’t compete for podiums when he struggles to qualify p4 in a top 5 Car.
Tommo, Yuki Tsunoda joins Scunderia Alphatauri
minton to red bull 2021
it’s crazy to see the progression and development of the channel! i remember watching this closer to the time and wow you’ve come so far!
I remember the time when you have only 126 subscribers when I joined. You have come a long way Tommo. Superb video
the Alex prediction: top 10 moments right before disaster (I'm saying that as a fellow Alex fan 😔)
4:50 looooool
What happened to changing his name?
I’m fairly new to F1 and I’m trying to learn as quickly as possible.  I love the videos
Is it pronounced as Daniel or Danii, genuinely want to know.....not pointing out his mistake....... Ted and Brundle say it differently
Tommo!!! You should react to your 2021 team predictions too!!!!
I remember perfectly watching that video the day it came out  Such memories man Loving every video ever since
You know F1 brilliantly.
I dont think anyone could have called what happened this year 😂.
5:45 lmao that regret
I’m waiting for 2021 predictions plz do the video
I started watching at the prediction video because before the season I look up random predictions to find new youtubers
13:27 me right now🙃
I subbed at like 500-800 subs
Red bull second drivers last less on the team than me on bed
Minton to Red Bull CONFIRMED :'D
you have a crisp camera
HEHEHE Im an original
all those painful faces when Albon gets brought up, i feel ya Tommo.
5:03 He would have finished ahead of Russell without Russell's race at merc!!
Ditch Alex Albon and pick Sergio
I’m an og remember u replied to my comments maaaaaax max max max max maaaaax
Wait you were actually really small back at the start of the season? Mad. I was there but I thought you had a lot more subs back then 🤣🤣
I disagree with Max deserving p2. Bottas had equally bad luck
I love the way Tommo winces at his old predictions, so relatable to seeing an old video of myself 😂
Cant wait for 2021
Checo finished P4 with missing two races to Covid...
I mean Sainz P7 really isn’t that far off. He and Alex have the exact same amount of points, only Carlos got them earlier
Hey tommo when you do the same for next season could you maybe also add some more specific predictions? Like for example ricciardo will finish second at least once or something ?🤭 would love it
"Buckuz oi meck da rooz, owrait?"  Yall's accents are ridiculous.
Who could've preditcted that you'd updgrade your audio setup too?
It felt stupid list to me back then. 😀
Announce Minton :D :D
Bold prediction time: Charles wins his first title before Max does
The way you go to hit the play/pause button precisely instead of clicking anywhere on screen or just hitting spacebar is PURE BOOMER ENERGY Tommo
ah mate i remember them kitchen videos, can't even believe this was 1 year ago, mad
I remember watching this video and agreeing with you in almost every prediction hahaha. Can't wait for next year's season predictions video :P
Oof misss the old kitchen
It is sad to see ferraris and albon out of the top
I feel like albon needs more time because you can't judge someone about 1 season. Be honest this season is a half of a normal season so he sits in the RB for one full season and that is not enough to judge someone.
Look where we are. Still absolutely clueless 😂
yeah, all year i remembered this face when lewis smashed it and your alex drowned race after race😂
Thank you for your videos, man. You’re a good guy :)
Any plans for a 2022 driver lineup prediction video soon? Would be interesting to see how you think it will pan out.
Your old self was stupid
Bruh i remember watching when u were getting like 5 comments on ur vids
Most drivers regret going to Ferrari
Be honest everybody made the same face to the Albon comment
"Is not a meritocracy is it?" resuming f1 AND capitalism in one sentence, that's impressive
I think this and "Why is Latifi So Rich" were the first videos of yours that the almighty algorithm suggested to me, crazy how much you've channels grown in just a year – and that you benefitted so much during the "off season" while everything was delayed and people just wanted F1 content of any kind.
let me make some bold predictions for 2021: Seb to win a race and finish p5 in the standings Mazepin will outqualify schumacher Perez to beat Verstappen if he joins red bull Sainz to annihilate Leclerc  Two George Russell podiums
Ayyeee no one has the right to call my homie tommo stupid.
PLEASE bring the spice in your next predictions video like 2019 Tommo did!
Loving the content man.  Keep it up
Uv really come a long way
boy he does look like Liam payne
the Alex Albon thingy was pain
About max getting P2 due to bad reliability Bottas had worser luck on his side tbh
I love the candid take on Grosjean, I hope you aren't hiding what you really think because of your follower count. Be spicy, it's more fun to watch!
At least I am not the only Albon fan
I won't lie mate, watching your videos actually got me back into F1 so thanks! keep up the good work!
Feel proud to have been here and seen your channel grow, keep it up for 2021 you're one of my favourite channels!
Tsunoda moment
The main video was recorded previous to the winter testing or after?
this is a representation of how OPPOSITE 202 went lol
This should be a yearly thing
Loved the video as always tommo. Honestly top 5 highest video quality on yt in my opinion. to bad people don't appreciate F1 like they should. You would be in the millions if F1 was as big as the MCU.
Giovinazzi's other family members are Jehovan Nazi, Jovan Nancy, Joe Venati  and joe Vanessa Courtesy of google CC.
Yeah. Gotta say... You deffo jinxed it for Albon, there's no getting around it. Oh, well. Life happens, right?
Albon falls off a cliff, as soon as Tommo becomes an Albon stan. Hmmm🤔
@3:25 He came alive during the last few races tho much closer to sometimes even ahead of lec
Those predictions were very good apart from for the traditional top 3 teams.
Disagree on the bottas bit. Bottas has worse luck this year that max did
Team battle closest is McLaren, Renault minimum top2 of that
:) im an original
Certainly not far off on the lance stroll prediction.

#AnnounceMinton
could you rank the drivers in order from favourite to least favourite
This gys predictioms are always wrong. You should change to different content other than racing. So poor lmao.
As an alex fan...it was sad at some moments...but still I would say alex had kinda good season...just my thought 🤷‍♂️😬 Also tom...you look like Liam Payne...✌❤
I still think you werent far off with Alex, dont forget he wouldve won in Austria if it werent for Hamilton collecting him
cmon seb. as the biggest flop. sad.
Why don't you have or use Youtube Dark Mode?
most of its pretty fucking true.
Still here as an OG😎
I’m from 2021, in before Tommo F1 hits a million subscribers and Tommo starting Tommo Footy (his football channel) and marrying Hannah with Sim Dane attending.
damn i mean-
Your Man Crush for Alex Albon wrecked the whole damn thing...
Best F1 channel on YouTube
That was great “thieving a living” 😂😂😂😂
I remember commenting on this video and yeahhh wasn’t good predictions
"I don't have that hoodie anymore" Man's got a girl ayyy
Danny ric smoked ocon
Damn I remember watching the prediction video and subscribing to the channel
I mean bottas had bad reliability as well.
this was my first video of yours (I think), definitely remember assuming you had more subscribers given the quality of the vid. proud to be supporting your rise Tommo! (PS: can we have bitchy Tommo back for 2021 predictions lol?)
I think it shows just how competitive the midfield has been this year when Stroll has 2 podiums and a pole position to his name, and he’s 11th in the championship.
NO ORANGE HOODIE ANYMORE???? :'(
love that you predicted a win for Max, hope that we can see a world title for him next year!
Everyone put their predictions for next year: ⬇️ 1. Hamilton  Mercedes  2. Verstappen RedBull  3. Bottas Mercedes  4. Riccardo McLaren  5. Vettel Aston Martin  6. Norris McLaren  7. Stroll Aston Martin  8. Perez RedBull 9. Ocon Apline  10. Albon RedBull  11. Alonso Alpine  12. Leclerc Ferrari  13. Gasly Alpha Tauri  14. Sainz Ferrari  15. Russell William's  16. Raikkonen Alfa Romeo  17. Schumacher Haas  18. Giovinazzi Alfa Romeo  19. Tsunoda Alpha Tauri  20. Latifi  William's  21. Mazepin Haas
Albons comments hurt
Oh shit such a nostalgic background   I think I was one of the 50s subscribers
If f1 teams where done on nationalities
Don't be too hard on yourself bruv, it's called silly season for a reason :/
We still bloody don’t know
You're good looking, man. Get yourself an audition or something as a TV pundit. Good voice, face for TV, and thoughtful commentary. I think you're great for it.
12:14 is similar to Redbull saying 7-8th position is of no use to us and Albon finishing P13
Should do a track tier list of 2020 as new circuits was added this year.   The last episode of the track tier list did really well 👊
I swear Ferrari's F1's Hendrick Motorsports. Both Seb and Jimmie Johnson are former champs who've fallen off a cliff. Both Charles and Chase Elliott have outperformed by far. Chase even won the championship
”Max should have finished P2 but his reliability and tyres blowing up” Bottas: first time?
YuKi tsaunda has been announced
Why would Gasly have confirmed more then Lance did? Both of them had a great start while in the end the both of them dropped down again. Imo for similar reasons.   The moment Vettel got confirmed instead of Perez for the next season at Aston Martin, Lance began to drop in confidence and in performances. Which might have been due to the fact people blamed Lance for that. Which would make it a mental crackdown due to unforeseen circumstances. This became even more obvious when Perez started to realise he had nothing to lose when it became clear there was no immediate future for him in F1.  Pierre on the other hand confirmed to deserve his place with RB, while this got denied for reasons that were similarly unforeseen for him. The moment that news got confirmed his season was pretty much over. Which became even more obvious when Kvyat suddenly discovered he had nothing to lose anymore when it became clear he had no future with AT.   I would say both Gasly and Stroll confirmed a lot of progress on a similar way. Although Lance’s pole came after it was already known Vettel would become his future teammate. Still, good prediction imo. Although it’s even better when you include how Pierre has proven a similar progression.
Tommo face as he looked in the camera as he was talking bout albon is priceless 😂😂😂
RIP 🤣🤣🤣
What font do you use?
React to your 2021 driver lineup video!
Albon was a big surprise just not the surprise you hoped for
love his nose, it looks like a butt
Back then i still got harts from tommo, now he doesn't even see my comment
Next time do constructors championship predictions too!
Didnt you want to change your channel name? Here's a sugestion: Tommato
You look a lot more stressed now than back then, I feel for you, that must be how it feels to be a Albon fan at this time 😂
Perez to alpha tauri?
When Bottas said "to whom it may concern, f**k you"! Im pretty sure it was in response to Tommo placing him P5😂😂😂
I don't think Kvyat underperformed that much. On race head to head where they both finished I think it was close? AT often split their strategies, and when the strategy went Gasly's way, it was either where crazy things happened, better cars retired, or at tracks where the AT was high up in the midfield. Often when the strategy went Kvyat's way it was the converse. Kvyat's qualifying was the weakness, both dropping him down and giving him the more long shot strategy, he was usually on or better than Gasly's race pace. Obviously Gasly was the better driver/had a better season, but Kvyat had a decent year too. This is a surprisingly passionate defense, I'm not even a Kvyat fan particularly 😂😂
Sorry Tom, no announcement yet!
I was watching this video last night wondering when you’re going to react to it! 😂
I feel like Og because i watched that video but idk when i exactly discovered your channel but very nice evolution @tommof1
the fact that u sad the bigest flops of the year are my favorite divers (Alex and Seb) its just PAINNNNN
just saying before Merc Russell was behind Latifi in standings
Please watch ApexF1s new video. Maybe you can do a collab with him
Hello there
I feel like I’ve been watching you for ages, can’t believe it’s only a year! Keep it up!
Man what a year!
so it was you that cursed albon mannn
Rusell would have been P20 without the mercedes, below Latifi
I was there at the original video 👏🏻❤
The growth of your channel this year has been nothing short of amazing. Well done, mate, and well deserved.
I remember being one of the people thinking Vettel P6 was a bit harsh 😂😓 Is there any chance you're gonna do a driver power rankings when all the drivers are announced for next season? Like just on pure driver talent not on the car they're in?
Would love to see more videos relating f1 to football. Maybe a video comparing the characteristics and ability of drivers to footballers, or comparing f1 teams to football teams (E.g Mercedes like Liverpool/Man city because of their dominance).
I actually think you did a pretty good job!!  +1 or -1 either way I consider to be close enough, and it would have been brave to predict what happened to Ferrari! Great video, looking forward to next seasons predictions :)
You should give points for guessing e.g. 20 maximum points per driver (so a total of 400pts) and you get one less for each position you were off. E.g. a driver finishes 1st but you guessed second so you get 19 points. Or with vettel were you guessed 6th and he was 13th so you get 13 points as you were 7 positions off.
Tommo back then :Lewis will come 2nd in the WDC Lewis :wins with a gap of over 100 points to 2nd place
#AnnounceMinton
Vettel was always going to have the worst season of his career this year. Ferrari told him and the world nothing he does this year matters, he doesn't have a seat for 2021. Big dick move from Ferrari (no suprise there) so naturally Vettel didn't give a shit about this season
Also Stroll was 50 points behind Perez and he started in 1 more race than Checo. I'm not sure that's a very good performance.
Fun fact: if George dont drive the Mercedes, Latifi probaly P19 because he finished P11 three times, while George "just" once
2021 predictions?
keep going mate good work
To be fair to Latifi, he was ahead of Russel in the standings before Russel's run with Mercedes.
RedBull’s decision is likely to be announced before this Friday
Tommo 2021 predicts: LATIFI WINS FIRST WORLD CHAMPIONSHIIP
Orange old Tommie: That's called forshadowing
I feel the pain of your Albon prediction. Wanted him to do well so badly
everyone pre covid is the funniest thing to watch
Absolute shambles...
Quite funny his 2020 predictions was the first tommo video I watched 😂
Who thinks Perez shld get a seat
Bro U said u will change your channel name
the way I burst out laughing at 2:02 ...I knew exactly where this was going...oh poor Albon
really enjoy your vids, keep up the great content!
You should do constructers next year too... and more of the most something driver if you know what i mean
Didn't know that I'm already subscribed for over a year now
Me: that's wrong.  That's also wrong. Oh, and that's wrong
Does that Albon call count as an F1 Struggle?
2021 - hamilton 2022 - russell  i dont think max going anywhere tbh
I think max only had one weekend where he made mistakes. Turkey. Where he had to most chance against the mercs that is where he made mistakes
I can note belive this was almost a year ago
you remind me of Liam payne lol
Imagine rating Albon 😂
Only Latifi could do worse than you predicted, when you said he'd come 20th lmao
13:25  Me going to rbr Twitter and the f1 app every half an hour to check for announcements lol
Tommo pls do a Formula E liveries ranked video
I made a prediction on Twitter about this and I only got 1 prediction correct.  It was Latifi finishing P20
Dear Tommo,  I've come from the future... no announcement on the redbull front yet!
Hey Tommo! Predictions were pretty shocking haha but enjoyed the vid. I would recommend having a look at Spencer FC's Prem prediction vids. It's the same system but with the teams obvs, but he adds together the margin of difference he was off. In your case that is 42. The lower the number, the better the predictions. I reckon you should carry that over into 2021 and beyond
12:37 sounds like you're doing a passable Christopher Walken impression
Definitely remember watching this video. Crazy
I remember watching that when it was released and laughing my head off when you said max would win
OMG! I was literally watching that video 10 minutes ago
Tommo 'to be fair' F1
5:45 should've been 26
5:45 should've been 26
Hamilton should have been your easiest call. #fantasyvreality🤣
Remember this like yesterday
Do 2021 preiction
2021 predictions ? 😛
Petition for Hannah to do the next predictions for him Like if you agree 👇
Please do the 2021 Prediction Tommo! Would love to see your opinion.
Day oner here, since 100 subs
Do constructs championship table as well
I think you're actually right about Stroll when we're talking about most improved THIS season, Gasly has been showing this form since mid 2019.
I', proud to say I've been here since the beginning
Video idea: best overalls from 2010-2020 Love the content tommo mate, keep it up
Giovinazzi: My last name is Giovinazzi  YouTube Auto CC: Did you mean Jehovan Nazi?
Im a new subscriber. This vid was sick. Tommo needs to keep the brutal predictions  😂
13:30 Horner and Marko are laughing so hard rn
That original prediction video was what brought me to your channel, it's been incredible seeing your stratospheric rise this year. F in the chat for Albon lmao
I watched this video 5 minutes after it came out, love the content bro  Day 1
Looking at it like this, using Helmut's logic, Alex shouldn't keep his seat. With Tsunoda confirmed in the alphatauri, I think Albon will become a test driver and Perez will go to rb (even though I want the Hulk to go there)
If George didn’t get his point in the Merc, he would actually be P20 behind Latifi
I reckon this Drive to survive will be the best out of the 3 seasons. Covid, McLaren Vs Renault Vs Racing Point, Gasly winning, Perez winning, Ferrari’s poor season, Williams takeover, probably a lot more. All that is missing is a title challenge.
I remember when Tommo said he wanted to get a OnePlus phone, that's how OG I am. Congrats on the growth 👍
Hope that Aston Martin racing point smashes it next year and there is a proper title fight between Hamilton and seb, would love to see that again
2021 predictions....albon goes to the job centre
perez really deserves the redbull seat man.
The finest 5head on YouTube
Imagine the amount of money lost if he bet on that...
That opinion of Albon completely fell on it's fucking face XD
I quite like how opinionated you were in the predictions!
Smashed the biggest flop one tbf
Absolutely slaughtered seb 😅
I think you are wrong tommo, you werent put in sticks because you predicted 6th for Seb, you were because you said, go home seb you should go, you will go.  I mean I didnt watch the video at the time but sure as hell I would be one of the people who got angered. Thats not nice of you
13:30 did he say "announce Minttu" :D
7:32 looks like?
Now just waiting for the 2021 predictions
We need the old aggressive Tommo back
That alex albon prediction thou - It was YOU !!!!!! you jinxed him. You were the imposter all this while.
Tommo think of how accurate your predictions were like a golf score. You scored +22 in under predictions and -22 in over predictions so technically on Average, your right.
as someone who likes Alex Albon, seeing that prediction brought so much pain:(
Alex was a surprise, a bad one though
I remember the good old days i remember I was the 50th subscriber
@Tommo F1 I think Horner or Marko said they'd announce the redbull seat after Christmas. They just gotta keep us waiting huh.
Latifi would've been in front of George if Hamilton hadn't missed that race, so your Latifi hate isn't really justified.
Alex is biggest flop of year... Tommy..... Alex had better car... Still didn't do anything.....!!!!
Minton for RedBull Wya Helmut?
I remember watching this video when it came out but i don’t remember being a new sub?
Who ever is the 1 person who has disliked this. Why
I think Albon is the biggest surprise, we all expected him to do great
was subscribed when u done the video
Curiousity: Russell still never beat a teammate at the standings  Mercedes Russell: Bottas 4x3 Russell  Williams Russell: Latifi 0x0 Russell Latifi 3x2 Russell (11th places)
Well you weren't too far off until u considered Seb and Alex¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I love this video, can’t wait for 2021 predictions
Tommo 2021 predictions: Vettel will finish p8. Reality: Daddy Stroll buys the WDC for sir lancelot and seb finishes p2
I watched the 2020 prediction video after sakhir
i was one of the double figure subs
Somehow he looks like Liam Payne from some angles
Max only made one mistake and that was Turkey.
E
Hindsight is a beautiful thing right!!  Excited to see your 2021 predictions now 👌🏼👌🏼
If Covid didn't happen I don't think you would've been to far off tbh
What gap between Gio and Kimi? They finished equal on points and Gio won the Qualifying battle too. Minus his amazing starts Kimi had quite a shocking season imo
Ayy early gang
4/20 correct, nice
New title:  Defending my 2020 predictions
To be fair, Latifi was above George in the standings until his run with Mercedes as he had more P11 finishes. He didn't manage to outqualify George, but he wasn't miiiiiiles off him on the regular
#Minton2021
RIP...... lmao
Imagine the u-turn if Red Bull announce Kvyat instead of Perez/Albon 😂
F's in the chat for our boi kvyat
That video aged like fine wine.
Lol I commented on ur predictions video pretty much calling u stupid for not picking Lewis to win the championship🤣🤣🤣
F to kvyat
Howdie
Hey hi tommo, Aiden told me you have receding hairline, can you confirm?
