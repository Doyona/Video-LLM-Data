Just watched the whole series, this is ONE OF THE BEST AND FINEST AND ENLIGHTENING SERIES OF THIS CENTURY! Fan from an Asian country!
Only just seen all of this for the fist time over the past 2 weeks absolutely AMAZING!
I wish Jamie and Ted wasn't such a simps, they definetely doesn't need to grovel before anyone, it hurts to watch them act so good with women that did them so bad tbh
Cut this crap with lesbian bullshit drama, for the best cut blonde actress she's unbearable, this show bout football, struggle with coaching bad team and all that behind curtains managing, no one wants to watch another brainless conversations between this lesbian couple
you could cut all the scenes with this young blonde because you just have to fast forward this nonsense and you lose your brain cells when you listen to her lines
We are back!
Where is the new trailer @appletv come on, we know they have filmed it !!
season 4 please #tedlasso
❤❤❤❤❤😂
Thanks to ted lasso,Thanks gaffer,You helped me fo recover from stressing, overthinking, U made me BELIEVE in BELIVE AGAIN❤️🥹
Season 3 proves that this is all like a clickbait.  Watch this awesome series for 2 seasons, then without a lot of good writing, the chartacers that we liked, suddenly turn gay.  Farewell Ted Lasso - Hello Gay Lasso!
Ruined.. They just had to add gay scenes and LGBTs to it, like literally everything else. Disappointed.
I NEED 4th season
Please sell this to another platform so we can watch it here in the uk 🙏... That's how you're missing us brits... apple tv is not as big as Netflixs or Prime here
This trailer has more than 6 Mil views and less than 40 comments. Guess Apple+ is botting again
10/10.
Does anybody know a show similar to this? I’ve watched this show 4 times now and it’s time for something new…. Thank you in advance! 🙏🏻
Late to the Ted train but this show was beautifully executed. I need to watch season 1 again to cure my sadness for finishing it all.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
