How people compare eating cheese and wine African cultures? Shits stupid but anyways Youngboy 4L
0:24 me when people in France are expect to play the role as the African guy who’s extreme with his own « culture » he apparently has in common with people in Africa
After what happened to Charlie Kirk yesterday. This song is just the truth about humanity and economy. Youngboy the realest of all time

This the young boy I like. This one hit hard on a personal level.  Trying to stay focus but going through change bc of pain. Prison, girl rode almost 3 years right before i got out found she was slidin. Fighting my cases waiting on verdict.  Felon for life. Started my business been 10 years now. Married divorced my ex brain washed my son to not like me bc she in her feeling about me. He is 11 now. She slept with my best friend at the time and anither dude while she lived in my home. Had me being stong. Still holding it down my G. As you should too. My 18 year old daughter and I are like bread and butter. She is the only girl next to my mom I will only love. Females are my opps while i continue to hold it down growing my ira letting my son know i will always be right here when he needs me. Continuing Being the man i need to be despite the path i have walked. Them rodes are getting shinier

Why this get taken off Spotify?
why i can’t find this on Apple Music ?
G This Quonnie. Prayer only bring change
He cries about shit in every song. Man up. Ur stuff popular but it literally all sounds the same. N don't gimme some bull like uts his style , he is an emo cry baby. Bad example for the kids who lookin up to him. Not that any rappers are a good influence,  but the youth looking for a father like masculine identity these days.  None of these crybaby rappers will fulfill that for them. When I was a teen ALL the rappers didn't cry about shit. It's ok to cry but all the time just means you a complainer of life n time to man up. This dude been making emo shit for years..... when I was growing up mf got picked on for that shit.....He probably bent over and took it from Birdman cuz he kisses his artists on the lips and rapes them. Look it up. Wayne, turk, bg, juvenile,  all admitted it.... Young Thug too. But young thug wear fucking dresses actually fluffy ass dresses. N say he a g? Wtf!!???? Ya'll making the world fucked up by supporting these misconstrued individuals. Damn for real, I'm ashamed of nothing myself, but for sure ashamed of the world right now. Ask anyone, the world ain't happy with itself right now. Well, look at what is supported right now n your getc our answer. My dick bigger than  YB pants in them tight ass women cloths. His girl probably got baggier clothes
He is actually the best rapper out out rn
I watch this video every mfn day literally 😂
God keep protecting yb for us 😔
IMA BE AS BIG AS NBA YOUNGBOY REAL SOON🗣🔝 YoungLuRTN🥇 remember this comment, some screenshot it 🤞🏼🖤 https://youtu.be/Vhq_GvIY28w

Bro said take your pants from out your gun.  Wtf u taking bout rounn lol
Now this nigga here is original this is what hip hop needs to change the game and slchange this niggas from rapping that mumble rap bull shit. Most trappers use the same base line and drum hook this cat is lethal.

NBA is so gifted, and blessed at a very young age ,but I hope he stay aware of his enemies ,thats trying to end his whole life ,trust and believe they plotting on him..  I just hope he remains safe and keep his eyes open at all times.. most of our talented rappers is gone..praying  he🙏 make good decisions &example for the youngest that's coming up now, and leave them into the right direction. So many of them is watching him studying him down to the T. Hopefully he will use his platform to CHANGE the Youth... God makes know mistakes . Bless u all was NBA 🙏❤  #Change

Even though Jesus is God, He came to earth to be a sacrifice for us so that we could live with Him, God the Father and God the Holy Spirit forever. We can't save ourselves by doing good works. Only faith in what Jesus did will save us. Just by believing in our hearts that Jesus died for us, we are saved eternally. It can't be lost no matter what. After that, we trust God to do good works in us. It's all about what Jesus did, not what we have done or will do.  ...if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.                                           †  Romans 10:9

He defiently turning to a gates sound on some of his songs. You can hear him growing in his music though from day 1 is huge this dude became smart from the ppl surrounded by him.. knowing if he puts few songs like this out before signing any contract he owns all the rights that is what is awesome at getting to where he is at, 1 the top artists & started so young with others so he knows he can change the charts with an impact like a few other know.

Respekt 🥰🥰❤️❤️
Everyday I wake up and pray to my lord and savior, NBA Youngboy. I physically recoil out of disgust when people tell me NBA Youngboy isn't the best rapper alive. NBA Youngboy has changed my life for the good. Every time I listen to NBA Youngboy, I feel we have a deep personal connection that NOBODY else can understand  It's like he gets me and understands my struggle of gettin it out the mud. Kentrell, only I call him that, has shown me love more than my own mother. I will always cherish, love, and embrace NBA Youngboy for his raw talent. I love NBA Youngboy so much, his kids are like my god kids. No other fan has the love I have for Youngboy. My devotion is unmatched. Never would I betray or slander Youngboy. I love him more than myself. He is the reason I breathe, I sleep, I eat. Everything I do has Youngboy behind it. Without him, I am nothing. I am an empty vessel moving through space and time without purpose. Youngboy rejuvenates me. I love you, Kentrell. I really do.
Maaannn say
Lil bro never miss. I don't even listen to this type of music, a drill type rap, more of a Common, Kendrick, and similar rapper listener, but I seem to enjoy YB. #fire
Life of a King

i miss the murder music ngl
How is this #1 on YouTube he's simply sputtering his hopelessness and wishes for love while simultaneously threatening the same ppl he knows will likely be the reason for his demise.

Fire 🔥
Remimds me of Kevin gates..
Jesus is coming soon; please repent of your sin and turn to him.  Jesus was crucified, died on the cross, was buried, and God raised him from the dead on the third day, in fulfillment of the scriptures.  He loves you and wishes that none should perish.  He died so that we may have life, eternal life in heaven.  Read Romans 10:9-13 for starters.  Believe in your heart who Jesus is and what he did for you.  Are you paying attention to what is happening in the world??  We are at the end, Jesus is coming.
THis fr bc like I don't need to change for Noone tf

I know some dont want to hear this but it needs to be said..For the rapper, drug dealer, prostitute, homosexual, partier, fornicator, drinker, drug user..Jesus is willing to accept you just the way you are.. Jesus died for all those and every sin and all a person has to do is believe he died or all your sins (past present and future) and you are justified in the eyes of God and will have a relationship with him forever
Yb is very lyrical when he wants too be

U was loving him i was loving u im in love wit u but cant b wit u what am i supposed to do 🤮🤮🤮🔥🔥🔥🔥
One day we Gon meet and I hope you on the same energy I'm on when it's that time💯 been watching you grow since "I Ain't Hidin'" and now I'm tryna make my footprint 💯
Top ahead of his time fasho💚 keep goin 🔝
Y🅱️ put the most realistic emotions in his songs. He’s not afraid to express things others maybe scared or embarrassed about some of the emotions he shows. We see it and feel it , I know I can. Real ones like him they try to take out bcuz there’s no other way to stop em. 2 pac (2.0)‼️ We ALL FEEL U YOUNGBOY💪🏾 and the way that he do it back to back literally is beyond insane. That shit not easy at all. Every sense he went to jail he’s been on a whole ‘nother LEVEL💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯I pray 🙏 Nothing tragic happens to My Homie.

❤️❤️💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
don't blame him.. cant sit up here and hate on a dude that grinds and work for it.. its his money not mines and I'll never even disrespect myself nor him asking him for a dollar when I'm grown ass man that's a beast in music and can do the same but makes excuses in life and i can admit that. just got of jail and imma tell you now thats the life I don't won't but for some reason music has brought me some dangerous enemies.... chased down by a dude with an ar15 it just had rained so when an female name April and bre'asia stop at an closed gas station and two niggas just pop out i knew what was up... they acted like they wanted an cig I said naw we good and I'm looking at these two fuck ass femalea getting quite when they got close I knew it was that time so I ran soon as the truck pop.. buddy grab that ar15 not minding you it just got done raining. I ran and slipped in the grass I have an level 4 vest on that I paid 2,200 for was made to stop 7 rounds of 5.56 and 7.62 but he aint shoot.. I got up and he said empty ya pockets so I said okay in a scared voice and got closer to him like i was handing him my money(35,000) and blue faces... he step back once and said give me the money and I felt as soon as I did that he would shoot and kill me because he aint wear a mask but the dude he was with stayed at the gas station watching buddy ran after me by hisself.. but when I took that second step in reaching distance and grab and shoved the barrel in the ground and with my right hand while I had the left dead lock on the gun I grab buddy neck and put my finger nails in his neck trying to tear his off... he let go and I took it he stood for a second or two and gave me that wide open look and at the same time scared look as he gave me when he chase me... he ran I aim and a voice in my head said no let him live so i did... and ran to an nearby store with the ar15 and scream for somebody to call 911 that tried to rob and kill me and I got his gun that I had took.. so buddy got in the car with the females and not even think in he was stupid to come at me again.. I'll be damn he came in the store with his hands up begging for me to give him the gun.. at that point I was in rage pointed the gun and told him to get the fuck out.. he ran out got in the car shawty back up and 12. pulled up.. right pass them and came in the store and drew down on me like I was the suspect.. til everyone in the store told them he is the one that said called and he didn't try to harm us and even put the gun down.. so by tge time they got done finding out it wasnt me they was gone... but the detective put out an bolo on the car and Houston county in ga dont play ever state trooper to sheriff to swat was looking for that car.. got them track within 36 minutes.. but that made me sacred to rap again.. so I salute nba because been through what I can't even imagine.. he deserves it
Only the real yb fans know that he has too songs named “change” 💚💚
“im inlove wit you but cant be wit you fuck im post to do” felt ts frl

🔥🔥🔥
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.

Only in my black community young  people go public telling the world how’s low-life they are, like it’s a badge of honor and believe being shot-down on the street like a dog’s, is look at like a true thug, but’s, in reality’s after 3 days later only person still crying for you is your mother and maybe your brother and sister, but’s, your street boys “please” they forgotten all about you, the only person you hurt was your mother’s, being a asshole, 18 years old, now gone forever, and the cold -part about all this..nobody gives a DAMN about you, the sad part, you play yourself …!!!

Is it just me or did he sound like Kevin gates for second 🧐
Damn I Love The New Voice! You Definitely Changing🤸🏿‍♀️🥶 PROUD OF YOU MY BOYAAA🔋🐐🤞🏿
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.                                                                 /.,./,/.,/.,./,./,

Str8 🔥🔥🔥
I love thisssss
Nba can literally describe his emotions in depth, some of them most people wouldn't even be able to process it if it was them in his shoes, yet he is able to turn it into music that has consistently become the new bar for everyone else. He goes through all those same emotions and still manages to be able to push himself to become a better person day by day. Slime is gangster from the heart fr

The sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works.  Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire." (REVELATION 20:12-15 NKJV)   Today, while you are still alive and able, may you repent from your sins, believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that JESUS CHRIST is your Lord and Savior, so that through Him, your name will be written in the Book of Life.    "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever BELIEVES in Him  should not perish but have everlasting life.  For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved." (JOHN 3:16-17 NKJV)   By God's GRACE, the gift of Salvation and Eternal Life is available to all. You can RECEIVE it. You can REJECT it. May you choose wisely.. ⚖️

Best rapper out👌🏾
He is this generations 2Pac. I love that he isn't like all the other rapper's. He doesn't need features from other famous rappers to succeed. He stands alone. He raps about pain, stress, losing loved ones. He raps about the grittiness and it comes from the heart. He doesn't just rap about fucking girls, being cool and fashion and jewelry.
Now I understand why Kevin Gates got his face tattooed on him…… Dis da ☝🏾
He might not know this but he’s drop hits after hits keep it up 🔥🔥🔥
Over a Mil views in 14 hours that's impressive 👏
This sound like a lil Wayne song.

Yoo this song fire🔥🔥🔥
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."     -John 3:16 God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.   We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life, we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sin/rebellion against him.  We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts, even if you don't believe in Jesus, or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible, you are still sinful and on your way to Hell. But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself by being Crucified and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins.   He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven  Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.   May God Bless you all

THEE most consistent rapper in the game right now and it’s not close. Yb stays pumping out hit after hit in record timing. As both a fan of his and a small artist myself, nothing inspires me more to work harder on my craft than watching him do what he does. 🔥 i hope someday I can have even a tenth of the fanbase he currently has for my own music 🙏🏼

Bro your only in the streets cause you choose to be. Your rich as fuck and still wanna act like your really out there when you not
God has anointed you as a poet of anecdotal translation meant for familiarity in riders who gotta do what they gotta do to eat, or just don't know any better, you are one of God's mightest most courageous and brave soliders and his #1 warrior and hitta. I know you stand tall on everything you've been through and have to see amends and an end to your own struggle against many men's desire to get you to not be yourself but you rebuke that everyday with the way you LACE THEM BOOTS AND STEP ON DEY NECKS, let them pray on your downfall let them pray to acquire you let them pray to beseech you GOD WILL NEVER LET THE PRAYERS OF SPITE DOWNFALL AGGRESSION OR WICKEDTRY TO BE USED AGAINST YOU.. GOD WILL SHOW YOU EVER LASTING FAVOR FOR THE TESTIMONIES OF WHAT HE HAS SENT YOU TO BUILD YOURSELF TO A MAN WHO CANNOT BE CHALENGED ON WHO IT IS YOU KNOW YOURSELF TO BE. I pray that your success and the success of being truly happy enter your life IMMEDIATELY, but as well within God's timing and to your betterment as well as your wholesomeness and the development of a more bountiful life to emerge within the pace of Holyness and Righteousness, I pray that any bit of what they chose to plague you with Legally gets diminished set a fire and extinguished to ashes and let them blow like a cool summer breeze during evening time in summer. May God's grace cleanse the toxicity and the tribulations, I ask that he imparts your continued  journey in life with LOVE PEACE PROSPERITY ASSURANCE FREEDOM HAPPINESS BLESSINGS UPON BLESSINGS UPON BLESSINGS. No weapon formed against you shall prosper and God deems you a man that many have come to appreciate so much, I just ask that the appreciation be where it counts and the overall good I know you stand for and stand to be receptive of ass well. Love you Kentrell YB Never Broke EVER EVER EVER AGAIN!! RICH, MATTER FACT WEALTHY, MATTER FACT THE MOST ABUNDANT, of all the Spiritual anointance and contentment in God and his healing his protection and his mercifulness and breathe of his direct unchanging and always benouncing lovefor you, his son.

I wish YB and Jania could’ve stayed in their relationship before all that stuff happened. Even if it wouldn’t have lasted because I honestly think because of the way they was separated not by choice play a big part of the hurt both feel about each other. I believe that YB is Jania soulmate and Jania is YB soulmate. Just my opinion !!!
I only like 3 young boy songs and this 1 of the three.

Got fired from my job after 8 years of hard work dedication and showing up on time everyday because the owners son wants to start drama over 20 bucks when he a millionaire.. I came from the fucking bottom and work for everything I ever had..  they don’t know nothing about being loyal and working hard.. I get no respect and I’m having a baby soon so they throw me out like a piece of trash.. no benefits no real reason… just because of what jealousy and people being unfair to everyone.. the world is so fucked I just want my baby boy to be okay in this world… pray for me.. young boy I love you man thanks for your music over the years… wish we could talk cause I need a Friend…
Keep dropping top

SADYOUNGBOY, this stream changed my life. My entire view of everything that exists in this world, in fact, even in the entire universe. I can never look at anything I know the same way again. This stream represents emotions that most humans could never understand. But I can. Thanks to this stream I was awakened to many things previously considered unimaginable. Thank you for this exquisite stream, I will never forget this experience

HOLY BIBLE-- 5 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: 6 for which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience: 7 In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them. 8 But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.
HOLY BIBLE-- 3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; 4 neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks. 5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. 6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. 7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.

“You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make your free"  “Notable quotes": *WHEN A WELL PACKAGED WEB OF LIES HAS BEEN SOLD GRADUALLY TO THE MASSES OVER GENERATIONS, THE TRUTH WILL SEEM UTTERLY PREPOSTEROUS AND IT’S SPEAKER A RAVING LUNATIC. *A speaker of truth has no friends.  *No one is more hated than he who speaks the truth. *It’s easier to fool people than it is to convince them that they have been fooled.  This truth will free you to seek for the Living God in the Spirit and to truly KNOW GOD instead of just knowing ABOUT HIM. The GOSPEL is NOT written with ink, nor on tablets of stone, but on our hearts by the Spirit of the Living God. (2 Corinthians 3:3)  The gentiles who have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, then they are a law unto themselves.  Under the New Covenant we are to be led by the Holy Spirit, not the bible. I was searching for truth when Jesus told me, "The bible is an idol" which completely changed my direction. After that I only sought for Him in the Spirit and He has taught me many things on life's journey. The most important of which is that He died so we could be regenerated by the Holy Spirit into sons and daughters of God. The gospel is simple, repent from living after the flesh, ask Jesus to fill you with the Holy Spirit and then be led and controlled by Him through the Spirit.  The bible is only history and has absolutely no authority from God to control us, the outward law was under the old covenant. Jesus died to redeem us from the curse of the written law because we were unable to keep it. Have a great journey through life with the Living Christ guiding you. When Jesus words are written down and Satan is using them, then the bible becomes the word of Satan. Constantine (1st) beast compiled 50 bibles, legalized Christianity and set up the false prophet (pope). King James (2nd) beast, born 6/1566, 6th of Scotland, authorized a bible in 1611 that now has 66 books to control people with, an image of God's word they make to speak (the bible says). By having faith in the bible which has been made into an idol, they break the new covenant of having faith in the Living Christ through the Holy Spirit, who is the true word of God.  THE BIBLE IS THE MARK OF THE BEAST Ask Jesus -Yeshua for the Holy Spirit.

It's not just the music. It's from knowing what you been through. It's watching you beat the odds. Watching you grow over the years, the hard work, the dedication, the consistency etc. Most people can relate because of what they've been through also. Nevertheless we got so much love for you. We want nothing but the best for you. People acknowledge you but you deserve so much more than that. You're a legend. I hope you know that no matter your fans love you and will always come through with the love man. Hold your head up forever YB. 💪🏾💚💚

It's not just the music. It's from knowing what you been through. It's watching you beat the odds. Watching you grow over the years, the hard work, the dedication, the consistency etc. Most people can relate because of what they've been through also. Nevertheless we got so much love for you. We want nothing but the best for you. People acknowledge you but you deserve so much more than that. You're a legend. I hope you know that no matter your fans love you and will always come through with the love man. Hold your head up forever YB. 💪🏾💚💚
