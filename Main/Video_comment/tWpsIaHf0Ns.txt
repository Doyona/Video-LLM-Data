4:19 imagine if Broad bowled fuller length 😅
2:40 what a shot!
2:04 Anderson claim up
Where is Michael starc?
Main
So glad Broad has retired, medium pace trundler with an awful open chest action

HAHA GIVING KHAWAJA A SEND OFF AFTER HE GETS 141 IDIOT
Well done uzzie khawaja for winning the game for the Aus. Great tail end stuff from Cummings and lyon at the end. Superb.
Ollie robinson should be banned. Remember his tweets? That why he attacked uzzie. Pure racist. Ecb needs to sort it out.
Khwaja wait ball. His batting style is like Dawid Malan.
I love cricket i am from pakistan
An Excellent 1st Ashes Test Continues With Match Is Evenly Balanced, I Reckon

LOVE FROM PAKISTAN
Ali cheating but still serving up pies 😂
Nice
Add day 2 to the playlist
Kyun England walo jalli na tail tere baap ka kapda tere baap ki jalegi bhi tere baap ki
Me youtubar hu agar aapka channel hi to aao milke Kam Karen
finally Anderson 😴😴
Ashes way better than WTC final  Because Aussies were playing their practice match too the conditions of England's summer and take on Bazzball and break the winning streak but    Stokes and Mccullum as different plan declares the 1st inning in day 1 and made Aussies trail by 7 runs and making them chase 218    Aussies as nevertheless won chasing in English Summer conditions will the history repeat or Aussies make creat history in Edgbaston tomorrow
If Broad and Anderson are on wheelchair they will still wreck Australia. They give the Australians sleepless nights.

Cummin with the bat and with the ball 💥
Wtf is happening
Alex carey has best wicket keeper batsman of test cricket this time 😊
Stupid Bazball is about to get hammered 5-0 this Summer.
Well played Both team

England Declared 2 wickets in hand root still batting. It wasn’t a good decision from Stoke.
England find pressure in 2nd inning. They declared 1st inning quickly. Australia is strong team. England should have scored 450 Runs in 1st inning. They could also play half time of day 2. Thus England could lead more runs.
Worst it  Umpires calls please remove from cricket it's maxpix clear in this match umpires maxpix lbws with Australia
90% Indian Viewers...😉
Umpires maxpix with Australia in wrong lbws
Khawaja well play
Dear England & wales cricket board editor, Kindly add those 2 second slide whenever a batsman out ( It show which bowler gets wicket and batsman score details etc etc) , 2 second for end of the each session. These two things will give the fulfillness of watching entire match in 20 minutes. kindly do the needful.
This is what test cricket is all about!
Jimmy Anderson's record in Asia is below average... He is only good in English conditions.
My God really entertainment test cricket is best we big fan England team
This is a good match ❤️
Now you remember declaration in day 1 is foolish 50 run more should give good chance now eng lead is 165-5  on day 4 don't underestimate aus
The etc catch was biased
Invinsible 🔥🔥
Youtuber please help me
Please help me
I don't know much abt cricket.. Just knew King Kohli and M.S.D ❤️‍🔥🙌❤️
England mis Dom Bess or Parkinson in the bowling attack... Shame selection
Brilliant century Usman khawaja 👏
AUSTRALIAN your father is our  England team
Come on England come on my boys 🦁🦁🦁🇬🇧
England will win 🇬🇧🦁🦁🦁
I love England batting skills ❤😮😊
Crawley , both times , wouldn’t walk if the light was green
The Bowland dismissal by Broad 👌👌
If Jimmy crossed his 1000 wickets after playing his 1000 test match I am not  surprised 😯😯😯😊
Missing aggression on mitchal starc
I support England Cricket. Best of luck and best wishes. Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩
Always watch more rain than cricket in England especially the ashes....
No surprises at Robinson's celebration there. What do you expect from these people?
The rest is rainy!
That weird fielding was set to provoke khawaja to hit in the air and he felled for the trap, how dumb 🤣
Alex hales is other important player for England team
sam bilings should be in the ashes tour
For the second time Crawley stands there like nothing happened 😅
Khuwaja ininings ❤
Australia = BESTralia
Ali is not the man   to spin the Aussie’s out. Please say England do have one?🙏🙏
😂
Love the voice of Michael Atherton❤️
Not balanced lol...If the pitch was typical England wicket then England wouldve lost by now ...As expected they had made flat track for day 1 and day 2😂😂
Come on Aussie come on come on, come on Aussie come on.
Muslim strength in England... Usman khawaja mashallah
Clouderson
Ollie Robinson should have been sent off….
A shameful display lacking in any form of sportsmanship whatsover - the umpiring is a disgrace
Traditional Swing by Anderson to Careyyy.... Mind-blowinggggggggg😘😘😘😘😘
1:19 what a shot by Alex Carey to the James Anderson 😍
england croud are amazing but this croud not support australia
How it's a balanced test when aus dominating comprehensively
One like for Sturt Broad
Giving an over the top send-off to someone who's already banged your mum, I mean made over 140 runs. I think it says more about the patheticness of the particular bowler. Yeah there's still a time n a place for it, but this wasn't it. Broad getting Warner out for the billionth time is a good example of when appropriate.
What is surprising, the game is Australia and England, but the comments are all Indian, Pakistani, Bengali why? I didn't find any Australia and England people in the comments 😃😃
Come on England
I hope Australia win this test match and the series.
Ashes series result  Eng - 0 Aus - 5
Cricket at it's very best.
Rain fudged this game man.
It's called TEST for a reason ❤
If pak vs ind play series then very amazing game we want to see
You got to love the Ashes, by far the best level of cricket other than the World Cup.   Also the sledging from the hollies stand
Jimmy always prove that age is just a number ❤
2:05 1100th First Class wicket for the ageless GOAT! 🐐
Crawley is the next Broad. Always complaining and never walks. 😂
That Khawaja wicket was some of the best cricket I’ve seen. A player on 141 suddenly completely bamboozled by sheer craziness. Brilliant cricket.
Jonny is very bad wicket keeper against spin
Robinson did nothing wrong
5:58 Cameroon Green What a catch! Oh my goodness. I am shocked.
Root is remain in crease he destroy Australia hope
Alex carey also played a vital role in both the innings of wtc final and here also he played.. Carey is criminally underrated
If by any chance, the conditions the next morning remain the same as they were during the end of play... The English camp SHOULD be in a panic. Because Bazball ain't gonna help them in those conditions. It's gotta be a traditional approach!
Tactics, strategy, intensity, drama, rivalry. Test cricket at it's BEST 🔥🔥♥️
Khawaja is really awesome player❤
Hello from Pakistan ..Match in belence excited for Day 4 and 5 My Best wishes with both teams ..
Alex Carey is showing his consistency
no its not balance...aus ahead with fall of two wickets.
First innings early declaration will prove to be the turning point for England loss
Ben duckket playing like Ringku Sing of England 🤣
Where is  J Archer ?
What a catch Chris green
test cricket is boring.........we want IPL twice a year......
Alex Carey - The Underrated star
Boland will be dangerous for England 🇬🇧
This is Beautiful!,Awsome Quality,true 4k(unlike Jio Cinema),Beautiful Ground,Excellent Pitch,the Crowed,the commentry,the vibe everything is perfect this is how pure test cricket is played and broadcasted unlike all the Asians hypocrite countries who make usless pitches and give 480p resolution watching experience by calling it 4K  Excellent from ECB!
Root 66
Cop that Khawaja, you'll never beat spazball.
England will win 2023 world cup not india
Cummins on fire 🔥🔥
Cummins 🔥🔥
Wow australia damn batting
हमारे खिलाडी खाली पैसा 💸💸 करते है  खेलते कभी नहीं . खाली आयपीएल करते रहते.कसोटी असली किक्रेट है.
Why they came back out in that weather is unknown
6:25 watch 2x after it😂😂
Its time for australia to come back now otherwise england will seal the game
Cameron Green is going to be one of the best gully fielder
Great commentary by Kevin Pietersen. Absolutely loved it 👍
No matter what Test cricket will always remain the greatest format of the game ❤
Look at field settings of England ,my cricket captain vadaapaav of Mumbai  even never think like that 😂😂😂
"BRILLIANT FROM ENGLAND IN THE LAST HALF AN HOUR" Give me a spell mate. It's the tail.
2:16 wow Anderson, through his defence and on the middle stump 👏🏻👏🏻
Lovely khawaja
Australia is their first innings lost 2 batsmen at 27 and England in their 2nd innings lost 2 batsmen at 27...that's the beauty of the ashes❤❤
Babar is better Then Kholi
England doesn't have the bowling resources to go through with these kind of pitches for the entire series.  Aussie top order will grind them down.
Nothing excites more than " Overcast conditions in Test Cricket in England that too in Ashes " Where are you My Girlfriend ?😂😂😂😂
When ever test match in England = rain
I am from pak🇵🇰 love you eng team❤
Now it's interesting how Joe root and Johnny bairstow plays ! If they fall under 200 Australia but if they score 330 plus England have more chance !
i hope england lose declaring early 1st day with wickets left are they playing against a club team ???????
Today i will make double century. ❤
Those missed chances have really balanced the match , now it all depends in how pope , root and bairstow plays
Khawaja stepping out sixes was classic
Let's go England 💥🙌
Nicely good match of day 3
Stokes era 🔥❤️ Best in the world ❤
With rise of franchise cricket, Anderson is probably last cricketer who is going to get near to 800 wickets of murli and 200 test matches of sachin. He should go and try to break the record. We might never see them get broken ever,this guy seems last one who is going to get any close.
So basically its a flat Indian 50 over pitch for test matches in England.
Anderson will bowl from the Coffin also... i guess
Wow. This match never one sided till now
Raindy day in England.. Very Strange 😂
My apologies to yesterday's comment. Over the Hill maybe but Andy & Broad have proved their skills. Both are veterans. In fact I think Andy came in with Harmeston in Hussein's era - our debutant Parthiv? - and continues. 3 flagons of beer Cheers to both Anderson &  Broad.😊
Love from India ❤
The Test Series Name You Know.  But The Result You Don't Decided !
Vote for england by liking this comment
The most unlikely first innings lead ever but due to Stokes stupidity is as much use as a flat tyre
3:25 That sound❤️❤️😯😯
I'm expecting Australia to have this test won today
That's how you play the TEST match anybody from BCCI watching this?? Use these videos as reference for batting bowling and fielding
This is refreshing test cricket to watch as both teams look like competing each other at the highest level. Unlike the stupid indian team who reaches WTC finals by securing points through home advantage series, and puts up a show like a team which is trying playing qualifiers in wtc finals.
Seems they didn't watched how India got khawaja very quick
Noice
Ollie Robison just outed himself as an even bigger knob than we first thought, all class from Root though 👏
Boland ko to bcho ki trh out Kiya 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
I would like to see Amar Virdi in place of Moeen Ali.
Bazball not helping than😁
I can't see ANDERSON WICKETLESS 😢 GOAT
Anderson delivery to carey was damn good.,. 💀💀
Only Root and Stokes can play in seaming and swinging conditions, that's why stokes wanted flat pitches
Aussies are winning this big time if they win the 1st session today
TITLE: ELECTRIFYING ROBINSON CLEANS UP KHWAJA.
Being a England cricket fan, sorry to say this......... England's top order (3 ) looks too fragile 😞. We need someone like Ian Bell, Alastair Cook, and Kevin Pietersen ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Test cricket at its level best. This is some serious match to follow.
Aussies are the favorites at this point in my opinion 🥸
Kohli - Shastri era the dad of all era's
Such a shame if rain ruins this test! Even with Bazball you can't get a result with English weather!
Ashes >>>>>>>>>>>>> IPL....❤❤🔥
The beauty of Test Cricket😍
Indian team be like : 400 bn bhi gye Australia ke😂😂😂
Thoda sa overcast hua , batting collapse krna chalu
Zac Curuly is odnary player
The highlights of day 3 : Carey wicket with beauty of Anderson. Cummins Sixes. Khawaja's wicket with exceptional field set. England short ball strategy for lower order.  Rain interruption, Great England conditions with ball Swinging both sides,results the  England openers perishes. Day 4 : Bazball or Ever classic test or Australias strong bowling or 4th innings show or Rain interruption. Comment 👇
This match shows how bad India batting right now.
Jimmy Anderson never gets old
To be honest... Still poor captaincy  Tell   me why did he declared 393/8  And why did he give again again moen Ali, he was very expensive, if not he give moen Ali it's 300 or 300+ score, England other fast bowler are good but struggle in the first inngs
Test cricket dosent get any better than this...both teams have big balls both teams playing to win but in different styles... this series might actually rival 2005
1st session decides today.....
I am waiting for Anderson Retirement
Green will easily become the best gully fielder of all time.
06:04 patty smashed green's head😂while celebrating
Olli giving Uzzie a send off after he scores 141. How embarrassing 😒
Dikh Gaya baaj ball 🤣🤣🤣👌👌 England ki kya aukat Australia ko hara de test series m .5 saal se na India se na Australia se  Gajab beijjati h
Not all but a lot of English people and their pride ,arrogance and bad sportsmanship is very clear...shame on you Ollie !!
Now whom will Richard Sir support Will decide who'll win?
4:07 that's just mean 😂. Poor Boland
We need runs, plenty of them this morning and afternoon to set a decent target for the Aussies. Any target less than 325 would not be competitive. Stokes need to bat well and I do expect some runs from Pope and Brook too. Jonny would play his shots and he needs a bit of luck. This is going to be a cracker jacker of a day. This is test cricket at its best- we are in day 4 and all four results are possible.
good batting
What a vile creature Robinson is. Needs a ban for that rubbish.
They Shouldnt have declared
Cricket was invented by the English exclusively for Indians.
Love from India for ecb channel
Good
Why there are shot highlights in Day highlights?  Who wants to see a shot from 3 angles in slow-mo in the highlights video ?
I am expecting England vs australia in final 2027
Pakistan and India could have a much better test series than Ashes but because of Hindus inferiority complex we could not.
Khawaja was bored and wanted to eat, he was gotten out by these fools.
what a sport, it's good for falling asleep
Well done boys AUS🇱🇰💪🇱🇰
Cricket needs to be banned in England.
England crowd are one of the best audiences. Love the cheers and that atmosphere.
Aur Bazball English kahagaye😅😅😅😅
What will happens if game is not possible on day 5 .. due to rain... It leads to draw??
🔥🔥
Ben Stokes invented Baazball but he himself is spoiling it by not contributing himself as a batter and a bowler and also taking wrong decisions. He declared against NZ and lost.. he declared here and will loose.. he decided to get Moeen Ali and Australia got an additional 70 runs.. really a bad decision.. Moeen doesnt even come in the first 11 of a Ranji side and here he's playing ashes and doing what he does best - conceeding 6s and 4s.. and then using Bairstowe as a keeper.. it's like using Rohit Sharma or a Arjuna Ranatunga as a keeper 😀
Cameron Green What an incredible gully fieder, probably one of best in world
ো
Dom bess in place moin ali last two test
Such a fascinating test - can't look away for a minute! Love the battle between innovation and tradition. Bit surprised to see Robinson and Anderson doing the old unnecessary send off thing though. Thought we were past all that...
Now this is test match is poised nicely. Hoping more swing in these 2 days.
Australia have got 2 wickets early but the field set is extremely defensive, if it remains sunny for entire day England are declaring by tea taking a lead of 350 runs and we know how poor this  Australian team is in 4th innings
This is what you called bazzball captaincy 💥🛐
Hi  in🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩
For commentary ❤
2:04 Jimmy Anderson 1100 wickets in first class cricket 🔥🔥
Ollie robinson is a tool
Intention, mindset and gameplay. The Aussies have come prepared.
Rain saved England yesterday.  Now it will be interesting to see the approach of England from here.  Nice to see Australia doing attacking bowling and fielding in the second innings.
Stokes Rocks🔥Khawaja Shocks 😂
জো রুট, স্টিভ স্মিথ আর বিরাট কোহলি সমসাময়িক এই তিন স্টার ক্রিকেটারদের মধ্যে বিরাট কোহলি-ই সর্ব নিকৃষ্ট।  এটা আমি বলছি না, বিরাট কোহলির পারফরমেন্স আর টেস্ট ক্রিকেটে তার অ্যাভারেজ বলছে।
Usman khawaja : Ben Stokes 🤣
Usman khawaja : Ben Stokes 🤣
its always worth watching the Ashes.
This level of match expected from WTC final.. but Rohit team simply handed over
What an amazing field placement by captain Stokey. He has been a fabulous test captain. Indian captain should learn from this.
2nd innings 28 - 2 in 10 overs. When you face good bowling Bazzball will not work.
Bad captaincy by ban stokes
Thank You For Highlights ❤️❤️
Why the hell it is written “ Balanced “ where we can clearly see the Aussies are ahead
Time for Pat Cummins and Australia to focus on building pressure. Limit the easy singles. A couple of early wickets on day 4 - especially Root - can open the game right up!
England ashes ⚱️ win
Sir James Anderson is Legend🔥
Most of the English team is full of overconfident and shameless clowns.
Green catch😘
gotta feel for the lads having to endure those 20 mins of hell in those dark windy rainy conditions, umpires should had them off much earlier, one over there it looked like they were playing a day nighter. All those times these umpires had their light meters out in Pakistan and NZ test series and not once did they get it out yesterday ?  We need to bat smart and all day, we need a 300 lead min MINIMUM. We cannot give the Aussies a sniff of a win or they will launch and take it.
Bodyline is back
There’s few things I love more than the Aussie summer of cricket but let’s be honest the last few Ashes series in Aus were so one sided and boring. Even the last series in England, despite ending in a draw there were times where it felt like the England side didn’t want to be there. It’s so good to see both sides truly competing again. Feels like we’re about to get 5 tests played with the intensity and energy of Headingley 2019. As much as we love to take the piss out of Bazball it really is good to see England be a strong, competitive test side again, world cricket is better for it.
Robinson is a disgrace...screaming abuse at Usman is typical of a wanker
This test going to be more interesting ❤
Who will win 2023 ashes🏆
300 target will be enough
Ben Stokes  best filding captain
For Khawaja's wicket, the field placing was great but the execution was even better from Ollie Robinson 🔥🔥....
Please keep duckett and ali in your side poms
Cameron green is a black hole in that gully region
C’mon Australia!! It’s set up beautifully for a great series. Can’t wait!!!
Khawaja owns Robinson
Robinson's unprofessional expletive ridden send off of Usman will be remembered when it's his turn to bat for sure...I'm thinking chin music from the Aussie bowlers 😉
One of these days batters are going to learn. You hit anywhere near Cameron Green and you'd best keep that ball rolling on the ground son hehe
Nathan Lyon...a batsman who seems oblivious to where fieldsmen are positioned. Undisciplined batting from the spinner 😡
Test cricket is the best format of cricket and most fun to watch. Please I beg ICC to stop the franchise cricket so all teams and players focus on test cricket and so that sponsors put their money on test cricket so that it becomes more and more popular and more and more quality players will be produced by countries.
Woh this is not gonna be an easy win for anyone 🙃
This is the Ashes we want 🔥🔥
Rain saved England
Australia took 40 more overs to reach the same total (boring) and got a bit lucky in the end (weather)  Superb bowling to wrap up last 5 wickets   As long as Stokes is there just do not see Australia winning this one
James Anderson 14 wickets away from 700 test wickets
It's not balance aus on driving seat ,4th day 1 session eng 6/120 and 2nd session all out target will be 197 ✍️
England deserve to lose just for coming up with the word "bazball".
Australia is like: Real Madrid of Cricket .
Ashes is ❤
England unlucky, Aus had all the luck. Not sure England will get 100
This is the beauty of test cricket.... Still u can't say what will be the result 😮😊....someone rightly said.... It's called test for a reason ❤...Long live test cricket 🏏❤
Anderson is a real Hero and Legend 🎉
Piss off league cricket... this is real cricket...
Broad to Boland easy catch for sillypoint test cricket at its best ❤ bazball stokes what a impact they are showing on 🎉
I enjoy watching cricket in England as we have full houses
I 💕 एसेज
No footage of Bairstow’s dropped catches? They were key moments in this riveting game.
Nothing, i just feel bad about indian spinners, they didn’t even get a chance to play, such a pity! No doubt india loses all important games, and honestly they deserve to loose. First in t20’s they didnt give chNce to chahal, and my goodness in tests NO ASHWIN what a fuck0ng disaster, who’s takjing the decisions man!
Aus going 1-0 if there's no rain
There's so much all-time talent in this contest and Robinson thinks he was "Providing the Theatre" with his sledge. Nobody is watching for him. Nobody would recognise you in a police line-up, Ollie.
England robbed by weather
Cummball > Bazball
Balance ? How buyest
I learnt something on day three. Joe Root is full of class and Ollie Robinson is an absolute grub. Bring it on Pom's!
Usman Kawaja.Treat to watch.great foot work..beautiful timing and transfer of the body power to the bat and to tha ball at the last mili second.
WTC ke champion Australia turant khelne lage aur hamare IPL stars Aram farma rahe hai ye kya world cup jitenge
god I love cricket so much
Moeen Ali needs to retire 😂😂
No respect for Khawaja from the English players. Ollie Robinson's send off was a bit much. All class from the English fans who gave Khawaja a standing ovation for carrying the Aussies
Ole Ole Ollie
"Jimmy Saville he's one of your own"
Where has my last comment gone???
Ollie Robinson. What a sportsman. England might be trying to bat like BMc, but they ain’t playing cricket like he did.
It wasn't easy to dismiss Khawaja, but man how well was the field setup to force Khawaja to charge. Credit goes to brilliant captaincy from Stokes & perfect execution from Robinson.
6:10 biggest joke ever WTC Cheats😂😂😂😂
How would anyone only watching these highlights understand that a substantial amount of the day's play was lost due to rain?..... That seems a pretty important detail to me, maybe a "highlight" even. Show the end of play and where the match stands overnight.
Shows the Boland fumble at fine leg but not Bairstow dropping Carey…
Usman khuwaja the best player ❤
Aussies have a big chance here. Their bowlers are fully recovered with no bowling since Friday apart from a tiny bit on Sunday. The pitch should be still fresh with all the rain and the ball will have a shine on one side after 10 or so overs of bowling on Sunday.
Field Placement against USMAN Khawaja was very well
Cricket WOULD BE a BORING GAME ! IF IT WASN'T FOR LEFT-HAND BATSMEN.
For cricket lovers the Ashes is like an orgasm...😂😂
Thought they’d pay more to the editor of the highlights this time considering this is the ashes
Watching from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
Again a controversial catch by Green
I want Australia to win this series. Feel like they're the better side and there will be a game when Bazball will fail. Cannot let that go from the Aussie perspective.
A nice close competitive match so far.
New chant for the fans 'Moeen Ali is a cheater, Moeen Ali is a cheater' 😂😂
The match offials, must search Warner and Smit for any sandpaper in pockets before a ball gets bowler. I can see the ball is doing something which it is not supposed to do on a pitch..
Root is very crustal wicket for Australian innings tmroww 😊😊
Jeera( cummins) make runs 🙄  😮But how
Game On!!!😑
Will the ECB take a stand against Ali, the same way CA took a stand against Warner, Smith and Bancroft? Or do we only hold the Aussies accountable when it comes to breaking the rules? Better still, will the cricket media make a firestorm out of this as they did with sandpapergate?
A perfect example of "Age is just a number" is Jimmy Anderson 💖💖
No matter England win or lose but one thing is sure only they can bring so much interest in test cricket by playing aggressively. This is the only way to save test cricket.   PS. I am also an old fashioned cricket lover.
England's head weight his paying them off😂
Robinson shouldn't have used those words. It's going to haunt him throughout the series.
England 🇬🇧
That 22 balls with cloud cover was just something else. Hope that continues tomorrow, Cummins back to his best. >>>>
Root will be the difference btw eng winning and losing .if he goes out cheaply tmrw aus have a huge chance of winning
Indian Batsman  treated Moeen Ali as if he was Murlidharan😂😂
Anderson is the legend. Never ending love story ❤
"Bazball" is well and truly a Bag full of Surprises 🔥. You never know when they declare or their Unique field set...
Any and Every field set is possible in "Bazball" Era 🔥. The way Stokes trapped Khawaja with that field was Amazing...
🕌
Moin getting spanked on all sides of the ground is what I enjoyed the most! I have always felt he's an average bowler and gets way too many chances 😂😂😂
’ve never seen anyone as consistently accurate as AWAKENBEERUS in sports predictions. He’s a legend!!!!
There is rain forecast for last day of the match so I don’t see this match going anywhere but for a draw .. unfortunate 😢
If there was series between India and Pakistan then this Ashes series would be kinnda boring infront of that Asian series 🔥
Anderson ❤
Happy birthday Moin! 🎂
Upload at least 15 minutes highlight please
Rain saved England bro Aussie bowler looked like they were gonna crash England. Also this BAZBALL cricket of England might work on swinging pitches but it will bite them in the arse on Asian pitches
England will lose this game thanks to Ali
That delivery to khawaja💪
The Ashes to me is "so so special. You can keep all the other Sports cricket is my ❤.
God Bless England For Test Cricket ❤️
Holy crap that rain had the ball TALKING
Where is Bazball ???Aussies rocks
When I watched this rivalry I'm sad for india against aus helpless and not confident. 😢
Test cricket became a batsmen's show after England changed their approach💯💯💯
It's a 50/50 chance for both Let wait and see
THERE IS NOT ENGLAND VIEWERS TO WATCH THIS MATCH ON YT  BUT INDIAN PEOPLE MUST BE THERE NO DOUBT
This Cricket is Different. Probably an IND 🇮🇳 VS PAK 🇵🇰 CAN RESEMBLE IT😅
Telling Usman to "f**k off", is just poor form Ollie
Bazball disappeared mighty fast late in the day. I was told that they would play the same way regardless.
Usman khawaja ❤❤❤❤❤
The beauty of test cricket. England dominated Australia in the first session and looked to be in control. Then came the weather and out went England's openers. Now we all eagerly await the suspense these last 2 days will bring. It seriously can go in all 3 directions.
I want England to win this game only for Ben Stokes. A man with brave heart declared on the first day and taught a positive lesson to other captain that Test match can also be played like this.
Nice BatteN the vittfoul
2:04 ,   3:25 ,     3:46 ,  4:07,   4:57  if you want to enjoy  real test cricket then hear this crowd sound real test cricket feeling
I love test cricket more than anything else
Allah❤️
They won't show the dropped catch by Bairstow 😂😂
Ollie Robinson was a right bellend for sending off a humble bloke on 140. Says more about his character than anything else.
Australia Always ❤❤❤
England made a huge mistake declaring in the 1st innings. The way Root was batting, they could have easily gotten at least another 50 or more runs.
Is it only me or the sound coming off the bat is actually bad. As per my experience, it sounds amazing when the ball hits the middle of the bat. But in this match, it sounds like something out of a blown speaker and it somewhat hurts my ears at loud volume.
The Ashes we want ❤
Tomorrow will be the Moving &  Match deciding day .   Come on Aussies
India has a big downfall in test cricket. Pant & Jadeja & lower order has many times saved India since many years in test. Our top order r just superstars but forgot to play test cricket & focusing on just IPL. Cant belive & digest we lost 2 WTC finals. We have lost that hunger & determination to play for country & create a legacy for years to remember which Australia & England players has more than our players. We are just busy with ads, modelling, tattos, showoff of luxury lifestyle, vacation, haircuts, instagram stories after losing & many more. But when it comes to sacrifice & do something for the country we dont CHOKE….we CHOKE BIGGER in ICC tournament. Shame on our so called superstars. We are missing players like Dravid, Laxman, Tendulkar, MS DHONI, Yuvraj, Ganguly, Shewag who had so much passion towards the country’s cricket.
I like caption for its called test for a reason
If I were Moen I'd go for RtW Or Diagonal against Khawaja
Poor English team
Ali has to go. USELESS.
Crawley seems to have a lot more difficulty than others recognising when he edges them to the keeper. I'm trying to put it in a nice way, but he's got a silly bich face.
Sir in current bhuvneshwar kumar can swing the ball most for India so he can also be a jimmy anderson of India so why he is not getting chance in test
Did anyone notice England's run rate was around 3 at close of play. Whatever happened to Bazzball?😂
KHAWAJA only name is enough ❤
Show all the changing moments of match, like Bairstow dropping catches. Be neutral man!!
Khawaja innings is not impres very slow inning
Expecting a exciting play on day 4 🔥🔥
AUS have a very long tail... 200 should do it for ENG
The Beauty Of Test Cricket  ENG Vs. AUS In These Conditions 🔥
Dumb moment of the day was Gary Lyon. They set an obvious leg side trap for a compulsive hooker. So Lyon just hands them his wicket in the trap. Deep fine leg, Deep backward square, deep square leg just in front of square....did he not see those 6 hands waiting ? He has an issue compulsive hooking and it will continue during this series.
Test is not balanced but England is jolted by aussies😂😂😂
Bazball doesn't work against Aussies,play test.
Rain not come then allz out england hahahaha😂
Somehow the highlights are being stretched to 7 min even they are of 2 min.Well done ECB😁😁🌝.👋👋.
Once Virat kohli tried 2 sledged bairstow then after he shows him trailor of bazball Since then kohli forget the spelling of Sledging  Power of bazball 🔥🔥
Holiday+Rain+The Ashes. This is what I want, this is what I need❤️
Why? ECB why? A shot 3 times? We don't want this
Bhai kya field placement thaa
If Root, Pope, Brook, Stokes and Bairstow will bat really well and increase the leading runs, then there will be high chances for England to win the match. 🔥🔥🔥
I have to wait for hrs to watch ashes highlights 😊
Rain spoils the mood really
Epic game
Match will be decided on last day's last session ❤️👌🔥
Well played Usman Khawaja 👏👏
I hope australia will won ❤
On his birthday..moeen Ali finger injury pavam🥲🥲
It's really amazing how pat cummins transformed himself into a good batsmen..those 2 sixes were amazing 💥🔥
England win mark my Word 🎉
HASEEB  HAMEED  is best plyar of test  and  love ENGLAND'S  team  and ENGLAND'S  people
Such an enthralling days cricket today 🔥 🔥
Maybe Australia won ❤😂 The match
Short midon,mid off,silly point, short covers,short mid wkt ,short square leg to set up khwaja  Bazball at its best 😮😅❤
The rain.... Bad for England
In chennai heavy rain
Stokes should not of declared in day 1😢😢😢
Why does Sir Chef not commentate on the international podcasts?
Khawaja played Moeen beautifully throughout his innings. Has really improved his game against spin. Remember him being completely clueless against Sri Lanka when they toured here in 2017. Man has got atleast another two years in him at test level.
3rd
Bazball❤
2:05 what a ball from Jimmy Anderson 😍😍🔥🔥🤯🤯
Both teams have  played very well
Even though I'm a diehard English cricket fan, I really want David Warner to perform really really well... May he get at least 2 centuries in this series!   Edit: I'm more of a cricket fan than any particular team or cricketers. I support every player who plays well. Yeah, as a team, I support, love, and follow the English team... Also, I want every match to be as close as possible, exclusively for the sport's sake.
