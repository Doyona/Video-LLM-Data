I agree,but WWE fans don’t you think that in the wedding shot the bride looks like Alexa bliss?
Dam I remember when they first started just a couple regular dudes making videos to this.
Yo does anyone else get the same unskippable xfinity WiFi ad every time they watch a dude perfect video?
No way the rage monster got defeated easily

Those two weirdos😂 2:12
The wedding video scene kills me because I have done a few wedding videos to see many kinds of those. 😂 One time I just filmed the wedding and the Groom edited the whole thing! It came out amazing when he sent it back.
The fact that the bride did a karate hip through
Who do you think you are? I am?
Looks like we have a new rage monster on the block. The bride.
Ngl white dress has to be the most real and worst one

8:48 the friends reference is the best😂😂😂
6:34 Me.
You guys need to do sick stereotypes
They really threw a friends reference in saying the wrong name
I'm surprised I didn't see one where it's the kids being bored out of their mind
The rage monster!!! A classic!!! 😂😂😂😂😊
I was 3 min into the video and I felt it’s been an hour
When I first saw this, I saw Alexa Bliss am I the only one that saw this but like she said WWe star like what? How was she dude? Perfect. 8:35
I'm thankful that the weddings I've been in or to have not really hit the worst of these stereotypes. Though I've always felt that outdoor weddings can be a gamble.

The Weekend Weeding- A weekend fan and a 31-year-old woman are married and they spend  every weekend being friends.

Tyler's depiction of how it hard it is to pull someone UP vs. DOWN was a really valuable life lesson, though 😯😂

Dude she's just like Margot Robbie
Respect for the “worst case scenario” scene representing friends
A naughty joke in a dude perfect video? How could I not notice?
7:02 “The bride has entered the chat” hahaha😂
2:20 - 2:38 My dad thinks the tie was invented by a woman who wanted to torture her husband. Lol! 😂
You guys should make a awkward stereotypes part two and put in when you call your teacher mom
He is down
That already rage, monster, and every single one but finally and wedding the rage monster
Repent for your sins and accept salvation from Jesus❤❤❤❤

The friends reference was amazing
A reference to the Death Star Explosion at 3:15
i NEED to have a wedding like this
I’m so glad he got his cinnamon toast crunch
Marital (Alexa) Bliss!
Leftist: "Umm excuse me!? Pink jackets aren't just for girls!... U sexist male chauvinist!"
Wedding speeches are always the worst!... Especially by bridesmaids! "I remember when i first heard about (groom) & i thought uh oh, i think he's the one!..." Uggh!
That faint was 💯!
Personal story here, I am a violinist, and I played in a wedding in the outside heat when it was like... 40C. It was SO HOT. the funniest thing is, when they tried to get people to sit because they wanted to start, they all hid in the shade XD
On the day Yall uploaded this I went to a wedding. Crazy coincidence 😂
The one funny part I like is from the CO2 jet hit the dude 9:16

1:49 Australia break dancer take some nes
Ok I have a funny story. So at my aunts wedding I was the ring bearer and me and my grandma had decided to pull a prank on my aunt right before she had to put the rings on. Before I walked up onto the stage with the rings I put them in my pocket instead of on the pillow they were supposed to be on. So I flipped the pillow around and it was really funny and my aunt had the maddest expression on her face before I gave them the rings. During the pillow flipping I also saw my grandma shake her head like,”oh no. He actually did it.” It was really funny and it goes along with the 2 sections about worst man and prank brothers. I just wanted to say this cause I thought it was funny.😂
6:02 was crazy
6:46 This took me out 😂😂
8:50 was that a friends reference?
In 9:50 lol😂
8:44 yessirrrrrrr!!!!

He destroyed our weddings. But she is driving monster truck
It’s nice to see the rage monster take a seat
Switch the suits
Love  it
Cooking Sterotypes!!!!!!
I could tell they had a wrestling background. I didn’t know it was Alexa boss at first, but I thought it was because I thought it was like that she was performing wrestling and I checked the comments so I won’t.
This is the only rage monster where Cody didn’t get affected! Well done Codes!
Bridezilla?
Who here wants a church stereotypes?! I can imagine the crier in my mind flawlessly! Please👍

I think Tyler is raising up his blood pressure.
Alexa  bliss
The craziest "Rage monster" and fight scene ever dude perfect ty was actually raging tbh and bridezella a female rager😮 (5:58)
1:19 gravity 😂😂😂❤
The fact that Alexa Bliss was part of this shows how big DP actually is
I dont get i jhon take you rachel could you guys help me understand it?
The  wife has entered the chat is crazy
The fact that the veil is in all those places means the bride would have had to go through all of them!😂
If you wanna learn how to tie a tie just watch Jason Tatum 😂

Dude perfect 2035: Racial Stereotypes

Did I really just see a grown man in 2023 floss
0:55 the spit out the mouth 😆💀
"Hey cross your arms" "I would if I could"
I would have never thought in my life that Dude Perfect would have took a quote from Mike Gundy and put it in one of their videos that is very surprising. Also if you were wondering "Im 40 im a man" Is from Oklahoma State Football head coach Mike Gundy
This music of these are so iconic and awesome
2:23  most ironic thing ever
Bridezilla vs rage monster

they should have the wives episode, and with rage monster they should have ty’s wife doing it against cody’s wife
6:01
Wait is that girl with the pink hair Alexa bliss from wwe

I just noticed the Pete Weber moment ty “ who do you think you are I am”
Kids rip crying in their wedding comments like in video on 3 min
I thought Tyler was Ryan Reynolds for a second 🧐
The rage monster is destroying everything.  Meanwhile Cody: THE BRIDE HAS ENTERED THE CHAT!
My family are the cryers
I love this video 😊
I hate to say it, but the rage monster actually took it too far. Bridezilla is the result of that, because you never want to make that happen.
There are TWO rage monsters in this video 😆
I didn’t expect to see Alexa bliss with the crew. That an awesome collaboration
Is that Alexa bliss during the rage monster part?
Only true dude perfect fans choose rage monster
8:47 this stereotype reminded me when Ross accidentally said Racheal’s name on “FRIENDS” 😂
Never expected that someone would beat the rage monster
The friends reference!!!
Bro, the Bridezilla and the "Bride joined the chat" got me laughing so hard
“Hey guys I’m Ty, welcome to how to tie a tie, with me, Ty”
Tyler don’t mess up the wedding ever again 6:03
The rage monster always wins

That whole rage monster set up was brilliant. You should pretty much 2 rage monsters again in a future stereotypes.
The Dude Perfect Stereotypes are the best. They do such a great job with their youtube videos.
Rage monster never disappoints
The rage monster bridezilla segment is incredible
3:45
Why is Alexa Bliss in a dude perfect video

WTFFFFFFF 3:11
WTF 3:08
3:03.05 WTF
5:45 the famous Pete Weber reference. GOLDEN CHOICE TY! 🙌🎳
Flirting with The cameraman (disappointing video )😂😂😂
6:49 ok Godzilla is amazing 🔥

That Has to be the most chaotic rage scene I’ve ever seen
you should do a School Stereotype
Friends the show reference?!?!
intense wedding planner is literally pepper from modern family
Do school sterotypes
I live in Texas and the words Ty said at 5:55 were my most despised words 😂
Not the Siserah Bible story 😂
Is that Alexa bliss
ladies and gentlemen, the rage monster has either met his match, or his rival
This is a rare one, but I've seen the "couple that schedules their wedding for opening weekend of rifle season" stereotype. There's a reason that weekend is always unbooked, but there's always gotta be that one couple that doesn't get the hint
I love the  part when Ty goes Rage  monster😄😜☺️
Is that an mil 8 or 17 or a mil mi 26?
bridezilla is no joke. It's real everytime.
The bride entered the chat😂

I love how they find a way to include rage monster every video 😊
The show off
He really said that you are slow😂
Do it about football next tim
5:25 I love that they always a find way to innovate the Rage Monster
Nobody out of 20 + weddings ive been to (im showing my age) nobody cares about the vows, long speeches, extravagant decor....the dance that we have to watch with ...anyone.. this is the bride and grooms day....enjoy...but remember,  the guests you invited dont want to sit through all this ...they want to eat, if offered and mingle....so all the 1000.00's of dollars on wedding dresses and made to purchase groomsmen and bridesmaids dresses are only for the couple and a waste of money...that could have been spent on a new home, renovations, investments....if you're not a princess ...please spare everyone and the long hours, waste of money and do a ceremony by yourself and a priest or whatever because we all sit there and cant wait till its over
Are we not just gonna talk about a dp and we collab
IS THAT ALEXA BLLISS
Did anyone notice Alexa Bliss
Hi

Nah at 8:45 they really did a Friends reference
I love the Friends reference!!!!!!!!
In all honesty, was the objector the rage monster? Or was Alexa Bliss the rage monster?
10:05 HA! Not only was that so unprofessional, they misspelled "congrats!"
6:28🤣🤣
wtf a double rage monster
Is elexa bliss there
F.R.I.E.N.D.S reference 😂
Didn't expect Alexa bliss to be there
Rage Monster VS Bridezilla? BEST THING EVER! WE NEED MORE FEMALE RAGE MONSTER!

Homeschool stereotypes next, please!
8:53 friends reference

The rage monster has finally met his match
The bridezilla bit was less bridezilla and more righteous anger, until she the dude and flattened a gazebo.
Does any one Realize that alaxa bliss is in hear
We just gonna glance over the Friends reference of Rachel and Emily
Imagine if rage monster and bridezilla teamed up and fought anyone imagine the possibilities
This isn't 2007 5:49
0:17 wait a minute wasnt that the guy from the survival games ? 😂
There should be a Rememberence Day stereotypes video.

Is that Alexa bliss?
3:22 average Texan
Flawless Friends reference 8:49
YEA PETER WEBER! WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?! I AM!
8:48 I love the friends reference 😊
4:20 what is registry, can someone explain
I am so glad I had a simple wedding. I live in one of those areas where people are only half-joking when they say “Wait five minutes and the weather will change”. I also live in an area where people say “Great to be living where it’s mostly dry heat.” I had my wedding day start out rainy and become hot, which meant it was HUMID for the ceremony.
You should do church stereotypes
Alexa bliss
The friends reference😂
First there was rage monster then… bridezilla?
NOT THE ROSS GELLER EMILY RACHEL ACT!!😂😂😂😂❤❤❤
Alexa
How they missed out on the uninvited guest for this one
This video was posted on the exact day my aunt got her wedding
I loved the Friends tv show reference when he said the wrong name
8:54 The Worst Case Scenario.
Dude watching the bridezilla with blonde pinky hair reminds me of harley quinn
Love it
5:42 Will Smith reference
Bridezilla was awesome!
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!
7:15  The rage monster met his match.
DUDE PERFECT AND IMPRACTICAL JOKERS!

We all have been waiting for school stereotypes
8:47 nice reference 😂😂
Pop
There ok I really don’t watch Dude perfect A lot I prefer Ninja kids tv or sneak attack squad but this video made me laugh A lot the Hotel stereotypes is more funny
I wasn’t sure if the rage monsters would duel or high five over their mutual love of hate, only to then immediately duel.  P.S.; the Showoff in the Dance Circle, mostly because it’s the only thing I have done (not even in a wedding) and I only know the hopak.
Are you allergic to cats
Rage monster is bad and bridezilla is bad and the show off was incredible and magical and really really really cooooool bro
No
How dare u ruin the Death Star only lengends would cry😢
Alexa bliss!!!!
I hat expected that panda was the dj 😂
We need school
If I had a million guesses I never would have gotten Alexa Bliss as a stereotypes debut
Tyler it rage 😂
You guys. Lol.😂😂😂 who was born in 1985? So with you.
This wedding is a disaster, but it would be fun if I was a guest
Is that Alexa Bliss?
Face
And the same fave
ALEXA BLISS?? WHAT?? MY WORLDS COLLIDE
Rage monster 6:01
The fact that they got the one and only Alexa Bliss to take part in there Chanel is amazing
The rage monster and bridezilla are meant for each other
Which phone is the only Siri what types of video that I could tell when the rage master was coming?
From Cooper, What was the name of the wwe girl who played bridezilla in the dude perfect video called wedding stereotypes
dylan  larkin
6:33 world star
Me when : 6:48  Hobbs Vs Shaw
I just love you guys so much, thank you for existing 😂😂😂😂😂😂

I actually like the dance circle
5:43 will smith reference
8:48 wasn’t expecting a friends reference for DP
Bruh i didnt know that bridezilla is better than the rage monster but rage monster has more experience than her
They should do a birthday stereotypes
My man baca went from coaching me in performance course to being on DP HECK YEA!
Rage monster seeing bridezilla: finally a worthy opponent
Who would’ve stepped on the veil?
DJ Double Vision 👀🤣
One of the very few times the rage monster was defeated.
The show off is my favorite
6:03 & 6:49
Cody going full WWE announcer was the highlight of the video
$$$$$$# 7:20 😢
😢you don't want me for this game but not in any game
i am the rage monster. i always break something or rage whenever someone does something to me😅
Where is school stereotypes? Please, Dude Perfect, from a huge fan, do school stereotypes!!!

Great one!!!!!
You are the best ty
My favourite rage monster by far 6:00
4:55 She looks familiar......
The one bit of the video at the end it was drawing the words and at that point I thought if he say welcome to the Disney Channel then draws the logo
Soccer game
Who do you think you are I am iconic because Pete Weber was the man to start a trend
How about Dude Perfect does a stereotypes thing without The Rage Monster? Because the Rage Monster comes out and make things worse. I’m not saying that you can’t be in the video, I’m just saying, you need to get some therapy, you know, to calm down.
is that Alexa bliss?
I did not see that through. Really thought those two were gonna kiss, I mean those two have a violent personality.
SOUTH AFRICA
“And the bride has entered the chat”  amazingly executed
Rage monster is turning into WWE
"congarts on wifey bro!!!!" bro that killed me 😂😂😂
That was an action movie fight scene at its best
I think that the bridezilla is Alexa Bliss
Alexa bliss vs rage monster

BRIDEZILLA 😂
6:02 6:49 YELLING + they both need anger management

1:28
the friends refrence
"WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE I AM
That was a friends reference wasn’t it
AND THE BRIDE HAS ENTERED THE CHAT
Rage Monsters are on the Run!
So we're not gonna talk about rachel and Emily
What a coincidence on one of the scenes of the rage monster when he says “July 18” which is my birthday
You guys are so cool
The Freinds Reference
First time he doesn't rage on cody
6:57   THE BRIDE HAS ENTERED THAT CHAT  TY: oh shoot, i better run!
3:18 it’s just like the real movie
2:27 bro I hate ties so much
Once the rage monster starts, there is no stopping him. There is only succumbing to him 😂
Is the name DJ double vision copyrighted or can I use it
cool
best rage monster ever
The rage monster has been defeated....
I think Ty has a perfect wife when he was a rage monster
The rage monster is so cringe
Just realized this but is the worst case scenario based on a episode from Friends because the brides name is Emily and the girls name he says is Rachel both in the video and in the show
WORLDSTARRR WE OUT HERE got me
Nothing can ever stop the rage monster
W bridezilla
THE BRIDEZILLAA
Why does ty hair make him look like 👶🏻 this emoji

Alexa bliss
How
the FRIENDS reference was perfect!!
Nice wedding
Glad im not getting married in texas 😂
Wow they really made bridezilla

7:17😂😂😂😂😂
6:26 The new ShangChi

Bridezilla is the only rage a Rage Monster can't stand toe to toe with.
the bridezilla is new
5:50 Mike Gundy
parish parking lot too small bride and groom the church is big but because of limited parking need to whittle down the guest list the guest that cannot get a parking space have two separate list one for the reception one for the church do not over invite just because you have the room because you may not have the parking spaces okay truth
The rage montser would easily win
If anyone was ever going to stop the rage monster, it would be a bridezilla
"Hey its me, Ty, and welcome to how to tie a tie with Ty"
7:00 it remembered me in sonic 2 where the bride when for the police officer who ruined the wedding
Just watch this with my cousins she is crazy for this she loves this 😂
am I the only one who notice that their was a friends quote in here
At 3:40 was it the wedding ring he lost in the back garden?
Yeah love this video 😂 But the 'woo girls' are missing. fortunately the rage monster is not real, but with tyler it would be really funny
I live the friends reference!
Ugh i hate weddings in summer! Why do people choose to have weddings in 97° weather!

In the Scorcher wedding, there's always that one person who doesn't sweat at ALL
The wedding Speech becomes a TEDTalk😂
4:44 Trevor??
Hold on a second I started to notice something, I have a passion of watching dude perfect stereotypes and I just happen to come across with the wedding stereotypes. I noticed this female character happened to be in the dude perfect videos. It looked familiar, could this be Alexa bliss in this video? Because I didn’t know that until I recognized that face, the way she screamed, the way she wrestles, and the way she looks naturally. What you guys think?
Bridezilla gets the rage monster and the rage monster tries to get bridezilla but rage monster hit the wedding cake
The way the best man goes “and he wraps his arm around me and lifts me up, and finally I can reach the Cinnamon Toast Crunch”
Alexa Bliss being in here was awesome
Alexa bliss did her charecter perfect and the charecter fits her well
The Bride Has Entered The Chat LOL
Congarts on the wifey bro. 😂
2:43 he _hard_ committed to that fall
Definitely rage monster
3:32 probably lost the ring in his backyard again.

The Pete Weber reference!!

Dude perfect makes great content but why are they arent getting subscribers and views😢😢😢
Who's gonna root for the Rage Monster? ME!!!
That was the best rage monster i ever seen
6:22 This is like every middle school fight and how the crowd reacts 🤣
" The Showoff " was without a doubt my brother at my aunt and uncle's wedding. He was about 6 at the time, and he absolutley rocked it 🤣 When the music came on at the after party, the adults were sitting at tables, watching the kids get up and dance. My brother was quite shy at first, but he hesitatntly made his way toward the middle of the room. Then, he proceeded to do " THE WORM " and hyped the crowd up 🤣 Soon, all the other kids had went back over to their parents, but he stood there all alone and totally crushed it. I cant recall all of the dance moves he did, but I do remember how all the adults were freaking out, going: " OOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHH " when he did something  insane- Anyways, great video! Keep up the outstanding work DP!
3:16 to 3:22 was so cool it blew my mind ❤❤😮😮🎉🎉

the "worst case scenario" was a line from F.R.I.E.N.D.S, when Ross maried Emily.
bridezlia vs rage monster ( literally me rn: f i g h t )
8:54 to 8:59 Why is there two the the same guy
BRIDEZILLA - NOICE
Please do school stereotypes
It’s not a proper stereotypes video if there isn’t a rage monster 😂
the rage monster first time to lose in a rage
The rainy wedding one was funny because the girl in the middle spit out water😂❤😂❤
July 18 = my birthday
Can you make bloopers and deleted scenes for the videos that you haven’t yet?
Your talking about a rainy wedding my aunt had a tornado at her wedding
Alexa Bliss in Dude Perfect?!
And the bride has entered the chat had me on the floor
A rage monster and a bridezilla are the scariest combo
Man im in love with alexa

Love you guys
I farted again
very bad very bad.
But Ty does most of the rage work
Honestly both of the rage monsters did really well 👏
The fact you guys added in 2 rage monsters (bridezilla) is really cool
That was probably one of the best Videos I've ever seen on Youtube. Love how you're always spending so much love and effort into your projects.
friends❤❤
As a osu fan that Mike Gundy reference was hilarious
It's so cool to know that a girl my dad works with is the twins' cousin!
I’m not married, but I’ve been to a wedding once, so this is perfect in every way
As soon as The Rage Monster started raging, I immediately said "WORLDSTAR!"    Glad to see Cory shouted it out afterwards!
I want to see an all out war between bridezilla and rage monster
And not only that, but you have the ability to schedule an outdoor wedding ON JULY THE 18TH AT 3:30 PM!!!!!!!!!!
It’s funny to see 2 rage monsters in 1 video and an attempt to stop the original rage monster
6:48 Or She Rage Monster 😂😂😂
We've got some angry bride in the end. Does she take some karate lessons?! Geez la weez!!😬
Who do you think you are I am
bridezilla....
333.001
i like coby the best
The bridezilla scares me more then the rage monster
6:30😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Pikachu!
Why are there so many Pokémon in the wallpaper
Can you please do a soccer one it would mean a lot
Why are they putting Pokémon in their vids and thumbnails????  This video - The thumbnail has Pikachu  Animal Olympics - Arcanine is the dog  1 on 1 with Luka Doncic - An answer to a question on Texas Test was “A Pokémon”
I wanna see someone else do the rage monster 😂
Not married.
the bride has entered the chat
There’s a Pokémon in the thumbnail  Edit it’s gone
How long has pikachu's smash bros ultimate render been in the thumbnail?
Pikachu is in front of sparky
6:26 now that some Jackie chan style action
I’m 👰‍♂️ zila but boy which is technically rage monster but different ish
I watched this entire video cuz I thought pikachu was gonna show up, never did, disappointed
6:03😂
“And the bridge has entered the chat” 😂
I think it’s kind of funny how in some of your videos you actually hide a Pokémon in your thumbnails
Wait didn't the last one literally happen in maid-sama?
3:03 3:08 3:10 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Honestly, the rage monster is getting very boring, and it's just videos of you guys wasting a ton of money. I'm sorry, but it doesn't fit your awesome standards
Is the rage girl Alexa bliss
Spotted Pikachu in the thumbnail!
The one person who can beat rage monster
Lol
there’s a pikachu in there
1:46 what was he about to say..?
I’m finding Pokémon in their thumbnails😂
Why is Pokémon on all of your videos thumbnails? Some one plsss tell me 😂
Why is there a Pikachu in the video title screen?
Bridezilla with Rage monster was perfect🤣
10:05 me after my friend gets married
Is that Alexa bliss
😂😂😂😂
4:53 Why does that look like Alexa Bliss
4:53 Why does that look like Alexa Bliss
The only one who can stop rage monster
Weird the rage monster said exactly my birthday July 18 huh 😗
I John take you Rachel
Okay, is nobody gonna notice the Pikachu in the thumbnail?
Suit Struggles
One question, how long was the bridal veil in the world longest bridal veil stereotype in this video?
Why are there gen 1 pokemon hidden throughout dp’s thumbnails?
Does anyone else see the Pikachu in the thumbnail
I'm just gonna say the bride rage monster was cringe
"Like this sermon." Reason #5,967,834 Cory is my favorite member.
2 rage monsters! Whoa!
Pikachu!!!!!!
I spotted a pickachu
the rage monster is the best😅😅🤣🤣🤣
When I was the ring bearer at my brother's wedding, I laughed a little when he said "I do" Idk why
How did I miss this, but not the hotel stereotypes
Honestly, my favorite wedding, the groom had a gun and when they ask for objections, he pulled it out, started examining it
There are pokemon in the THUMBHAILS YEAH
No way they used a Mike Gundy reference.
Why is there a Pikachu in the thumbnail? I don’t remember seeing one in the video?
I rewatched this trying to figure out why Pikachu is in the thumbnail, and after rewatching it... I still have no idea
Favorites
This video has the funniest rage monster segment that I have ever seen lol
“The bride has entered the chat”
I just keep coming back and watching these.
5:09 weddings in Florida be like
Why is there a Pikachu in the thumbnail ?
WWE wedding😭😂😂😂
Alexia bliss yesss
Welcome to Bridezilla. The new generation of the Rage Monsters
6:16 Alexa bliss
July 18th was my birthday
5:27 “you can do that”🤣🤣🤣
Am I the only one who just noticed Pikachu in the thumbnail?  Edit: Now he's gone
Pikachu?
Does anyone else see the Pokémon in their thumbnails???
6:02 6:49  Who’s was better?
Pikachu = GOAT
Garrett’s dance moves are underrated
Why is there a pikachu on the thumbnail
Leave it to Ty to do the rage monster. It hurt me pressing dislike on this video
That. Cake. Was. Perfect. NOOOOO THE CAKE GOT DESTROYED. I COMMENTED B4 IT HAPPENED.
The friend’s reference
anyone notice that pikachu in the thumbnail?
Finally someone can step up and handle the rage monster
What's with the pikachu in the thumbnail
I almost feel like bridzilla and rage monster should have teamed up
I clicked on this because of the Pikachu in the thumbnail but what was it referencing? I didn't notice anything about pokemon in the video???
the friends reference  made me DIE hilarious lol
Pikachu ?
Y’all are the best at acting
rage monster got that new COD finisher
That friends reference was so well done!
Why is pikachu in the thumbnail?
No one talking about friends mention in the 'worst case scenario '
Rage monster was best
4:41 - Alexa Bliss ? :O
Ty pulled a Pete Weber in the objector stereotype with the quote, "Who do you think you are? I am!" when Pete Weber defeated Jason Belmonte in the pba us open title match on February 26, 2012. Since I posted this on February 26, 2023, I can actually say that I posted this reply about him exactly 11 years ago.
Someone finally beat the Rage Monster....  All hail bridezilla.
Tyler I like when you turn in to the rage monster
love the friends reference 🔥🔥
AND THE BRIDE HAS ENTERED THE CHAT 💀😭
The Pete Weber reference really was the cherry on top for this rage monster
Alexa Bliss was great!!!!!
"And the Bride has entered the chat" got me
Inviting Alexa Bliss was probably the best decision in the video. this video could not have been more perfect
My aunts wedding was a rainy day. Luckily the storm came after when everyone was hanging out and eating. I remember the wind blew a canopy in the air and a pole hit a baby in the forehead.
Plot twist: The runaway bride didn't mean to crash into the gazebo.
Ty really said the Pete Weber quote
Is it me or did I just realize that’s Alexa bliss
Ayoo was that Alexa Bliss?! 4:53
Alexa Bliss can actually attack men now because she can’t do that in wwe. (Except for Rhea Ripley lol) great video
8:47 I love the Friends reference
And the bride has entered the chat!
For a second I thought Dude Perfect went dirty minded
This was the greatest stereotypes video in dp history!
Amusement Park Stereotypes coming soon???
Can you guys please do a video like the LUKA one you just did but with Patrick Mahomes. Maybe take him into the gameroom and play madden or something.
Let's go to Accent Stereotypes!
Bhai enter india and see the dance circle intensity
I DIED AT THAT FRIENDS REFERENCE YESSSSSSSSS 🤣🤣🤣🤣
6:03 the rage monster
You Keep my soon-to-be wife's name out your mouth! (Is that a Will Smith joke?)  Also it's great to see 2 rage monsters in a stereotype video
Suit struggles for sure! My sister's wedding is in less than two weeks and I still don't have my suit!
The rage monster has met its match
Next time in February do valentines stereotypes.
Do a school stereotypes
The rage monster has met his match 6:47
I thought there was no rage monster 6:05
Did anyone get the “worst case scenario” from friends (the show) I don’t know if it was on purpose but I thought it was funny😭
Why does the bride look like an actual villian
July 18 my birthday
Nice to see Cody wasn't injured by the Rage Monster lol
“And the bride has entered the chat”

THE DISAPPOINTING VIDEO 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Just to clear, nobody’s wedding REALLY got wrecked during the rage monster scene, right? 🤣😆
whenever i watch this and i see the bride go "ITS NOT YOUR WEDDING! AHHHHH!" i feel a wave of cringe that hits me
9:48 is she cheating on him?
Is the part with saying the wrong name from friends?

Cody saying "the bride has entered the chat" was so funny😂😂😂
The showoff
Would have love to see the Wedding Crashers. But still another amazing video by dude perfect!

They always figure out a scenario for Rage Monster. And the heartless fury is BEAUTIFUL
School sterotypes, anyone?
Please do school stereotypes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
MY FAVRITE IS RAGE MONSTER AND BRIDEZILLA
The fainter was me at my sister wedding- luckily I didn't faint but during the last minute final prayer I had to go sit in the pews (I was in the line of the men upfront)
These videos are hilarious
We just gonna ignore the Alexa Bliss cameo
🫢
Sparky is a lucky man for marrying alexia bliss
Now the wedding is Bridezilla with Ty's Rage Monster
Wish there was a blooper reel for this!
The rage monster has been defeated
She beat the rage monster:0

I thought that was alexa bliss
Here is the moment we been all waiting for --> 6:04 6:50
I love you guys
You know guys I see storytype videos only for rage monster
The disappointing wedding video got me cracking up 😆
Bridezilla should be a common character
The twins During the rage 😅
as I wait patiently for the rage monster I eat my grapes and Cheetos in peace.
0:30 Cody and and Tim should’ve switched lol
7:34 why does the bride have a monster truck?
The friends reference is amazing
Recently had a friend leave their wedding in a helicopter
My uncle called my aunt the wrong name at their wedding. They’ve been married over 30 years, so I guess it worked 🤣
imagine bridezilla getting married to the rage monster. Now thats something
Some of these remind me of Lego Star Wars stop motion series
the friends reference
Am I the only one that wants to see y’all do a sand castle building contest?
I love your Chanel
3:13
oh so the asian guy knows karate... hmmm
"Keep my wifes name out your mouth" Oh Will Smith.....😂😂
“Who do you think you are, I am”😂
The bride has entered the chat 💀
The bridezzla look like a WWE wrestlers
6:15
did anyone else notice the F.r.i.e.n.d.s reference at 8:45?! it had me rolling on the floor!
Isn’t that how Alexa Bliss’s wedding went down
I can not believe you four flew all the way to LEONARD, TEXAS just to film this video. Much respect. And yes, Dude Perfect, I am citing this video in Macadamia Beach Romance.
Emioaser
My favorite is ty in the dance circle
Cory's sermon face 😂
“Come after me I’m a man I’m 40.”
The "disappointing wedding video" was so funny 😂😂😂😂
You should do a school stereotype
Hi,  I love seeing your stereotypes. I think you guys should try doing a homeschool stereotypes. It would be really funny to see!
Can we please get more stereotypes in 2023.
😂😂😂
At least Cody didn’t trigger the Rage Monster this time
that was most funny rage monster series lol
My favorite is the DANCE CIRCLE
the rage monster with bridezilla oh my gahd
You guys should do hotel stereotypes❤😁

Best Rage Monster scene ever 😂😂😂
7:02 Coby 🤣🤣🤣
“WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?! I AM!!!”
the references in the rage monster clip is insane 💀💀💀
I actually thought Coby was gonna be the Rage Monster at 3:22!
WWE wrestler really into dude perfect video
the wedding brawl had me rollin
Anybody else get the Pete Weber reference?
Bridezila is something else
I just watched Avatar 2 today
These videos get me every time.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
6:29 has to be taken from a cartoon
6:51  FIRST FEMININE RAGE MONSTER
The bridezilla has to be the biggest plot twist of the century...
🤩
Does anyone else wonder how much this would have costed?
Getting real comfortable with the two no skip ads
Best part is the friends reference 😭
Bro the ross wedding reference its the best part
WATH ALEXA BLISSS
Friends refrence

8:48 Friends refrence 🤣🤣
The Ultimate battle: Rage Monster vs Bridezilla
Cheeky little friends reference
Jesus loves you
hi
Alexa bliss
Best rage monster by far
i love the new rage monster
Congratulations on finding such beautiful women that still put up with you guys after all these years.
Alexa bliss is in a dude perfect video, I think a timetraveller moved something he wasnt supposed to
Repeat after me,I John take Emily,John:I John take Rachel. 😂Totally brings back friends memories
All i can think of is friends for Emily and rachel
Mr showoff  was crazy.
What was with the Pete Webber reference lol
At my parents wedding my uncle stuck a note on the bottom of my father's shoe that said 'HELP ME' and all the bridesmaids were holding back laughter the whole time
You the best, dude perfect!
who else thinks te rage monster should have been the one who wasnt invited   👇
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE I AM
The runaway bride scene got me thinking I was in a Nissan sales event ad
Was I the only one that knew emotional breakdown was going to be first
I would probably be the scorching hot wedding because I live in Colorado
You guys should do hockey stereotypes
Can you guys make Birthday Stereotypes?
This is so awesome and funny.
2:47 😂😂😂
😂
I'm the long winded pastor and the tie noob, so if you think about it, it doesn't work out
You guys should do New Years stereotypes
bridezilla vs range monster❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
the prank brother 🤣
Alexa bliss? Really I never thought
Who do you think you are? I am
man the best thing about the stereotype stuff is the rage monster
6:05 Ty: GIMME THESE FLOWERS YOU’RE SO SLOW The guy he took the flowers from: 🙂
Do easter one
Ok, I laughed more than necessary at the never ending veil
I’m so proud that you guys quoted friends when you said I take thee Rachel is stead of Emily
I might just have to play this video on the big screen at my wedding.
The starting skit THAT WOMAN MARRIED JHON WICK
mmm yes i am a wedding cake
The Rage Monster and BrideZilla
L bride
The maybe not at all hot take, Guest in white is worse then rage monster
I thought this rage monster was pretty tame at first lol
6:03 everybody’s favorite part
If this came out in June it would've been perfect l, as I was a groomsman for my sister's wedding
The FRIENDS quote! Yessss!
Idk if anybody knows what Tyler said “who do you think you are I am! That’s what the famous bowler Pete Weber said
I would love to see a video about how to tie a tie with ty
6:49
i love dude perfect from joikubabs
Dude perfect should have their own college football bowl game
I like how you chose coby to do the tie thing cause i remember he was happy in a OT when Cody brought a tie with a fan and it was already knotted.
5:45 - Pete Weber reference?
8:48 i understood that reference
8:50 I sense a REFERENCE!!!  Context: in a live-action show called FRIENDS, the groom messes up their wedding by saying this exact line, _word for word_ (just replace John with Ross and thats what he said)
Lol the addition of Bridezilla was just downright genius🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Really dig the friends reference 😂
Ig sparky just found another wife since the other one ran away 😂
4:51 This guy’s my favorite
Rage monster solos the woman
5:47 nice Pete Weber reference
I am unmarried
Finally!  Someone who can defeat the rage monster.
Lol😮😅😅😅😅😂😂😂
The sneaky friends reference at 8:50
i've never been to a wedding, but if i had to pick one, it would probably be the emotional, the dance circle, the tie noob, the over the top DJ (just so i can dance), and the awkward speech person  Also just a side note 6:49 - 7:36 was very unexpected and also THE BEST PART OF THIS ENTIRE VIDEO DUDE PERFECT
The dance circle happend at my high school homecoming
That Rage Monster and the Bridezilla part is absolutely amazing and chaotic!
Bruh the budget is insane
😍
Bridezilla really got me
Getting married in the rai is lucky
Never a day in my life would I think I'd be seeing Alexa Bliss in a dude perfect video
Can't believe I'm just now noticing the little water spit at 0:55 haha, perfect
rage monster vs bridezilla for the win
Ha ha
Sparky laugh at 4:25
😂😂❤️
3:18 Well its right *SPOILER ALERT* it does get destroyed  Accurate
Was it just me or was that Alexa Bliss
You guys should do cross country or equestrian next! 🏃‍♀🐴
not the tennis shoes with the dress
still no like rage monster. It's not perfect. It's DUDE PERFECT!!!!
I would know I watch WWE
It's not Alexa bliss
Tyler does it flawlessly
Yeah he can
🤬
I can’t believe you managed to make a funny Friends reference!
Man be using Sisera’s death as a poorly used bible verse😂
I think this is before the new parent stereotypes
Love the Mike Gundy and Friends references lol
the mike gundy line🤣
But imagine really scheduling a wedding in Texas in the month of July at 3 in the afternoon
I love the stereotype videos that they do there so funny but at the same time true lol
I don't care what anyone says no one can do rage monster better than Tyler lol
5:26 Christians will never add that part
wait is that Alexa Bliss
I love the friends reference
I love the rage monster
You had to ruin it with the female rage monster, didn’t you?
I love these stereotype videos my favorite one is Christmas stereotype
And here I thought the rage monster was stopped , but in reality he was doubled
how entertaining...really entertaining video...
I'm not married, buy I'm engaged
They forgot one stereotype…  “The Hangover”
I like the rage monster and I like the bridezilla
you guys should make a church steryotypes
Bro Alexa bliss id never seen the day
2 rage MONSTERS
I liked the stereotypes
va iubesc dude perfect
She beat the rage monster, that’s a little scary
Go on 8:54. The scene is alot like an episode on FRIENDS when Ross is marrying Emily but takes Rachel's name during the vow.
Bro that cinnamon toast crunch speech was the best
Lol
Lol
9:30 was😂😂😂😂
“I’m a man, I’m 40!” Haha
I love the friends reference
No one’s talking about the “saying Rachel instead of Emily” Friends reference I was giggling at that

Congrats to the bride and groom their lives are officially over
It seems like the Rage Monster met his match.
Alexa was an excellent choice for this.
definitely tie noob
My favorite stereotypes are bridezilla and rage monster
6:57 And the Bride has enter the chat - Cody 2022

The fact that Alexa Bliss’s in this role is incredible
3:47 Why is Joe Biden at a wedding?

love “take you Rachel” thing from friends
THE FRIENDS REFERENCE YESSS
Was laughing the whole time 😜

Tyler:going SSJ4
Requesting Amusement park Stereotypes
You guys forgot *"the last-minute wedding singers,"* one who thinks they can sing but makes everyone’s ears bleed and the other who impresses everyone; that one was me at a friend’s wedding last month.
I loved the part were the plant with the suit came out with the strawberry and they are peanut butter and they kissed
Best battle I have ever seen 😂😂😂
When need to see Halloween Syteotypes part 2
"Who do you think you are? I am." That's a classic.
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE I AM
Yesss! I love all of your guys stereotypes! Also, this is so random, and you guys probably don’t care (and I honestly don’t know if you guys even read these comments), but I thought there was a chance y’all might find it funny so I decided I’d add it to my comment. My youngest sister Mykah, (whose 11), had a dream the other night about you guys. She said in her dream, I don’t remember all of the details, but this was the main part that I found hilarious, for some reason we were doing something with y’all, and then the the twins Cory and Coby turned evil or something and started attacking us all😂 Again, so random and weird, but I thought you guys might find that at least some what amusing.
Wow a new rage monster but a female
Bruh this is funny
This is the best stereotypes video yet!
Lol I've been in the middle of a dance circle
WAIT IS THAT ALEXA BLISS
I'm the Brodzilla
YO WHAT THE HECK ITS BRIDEZILLA

@DudePerfect Please do library stereotypes
6:49 it’s just rage monster(female edition)
Yessir that friends reference was perfect
6:34 did they all actually say this? Also could they add the other twin to the live chat to?
I didn’t even realise that Bridezilla and Runaway Bride is Alexa Bliss
So wedding crashers didn’t make the list?
I don't think I've been to enough weddings to find this entertaining
I laughed so hard!!! Definitely top 3 stereotypes!! BRIDEZILLA!
Do new dog owner stereotypes
How much did this cost to shoot
0:40, the lineup of those guys who have no idea how to dress nor planned out what they were wearing.
Finally a new stereotype video!
the best man cinnamin toast part made me cry
The rage monster never gets old
Worlddd starrr 🤣
In Greece, things are completely different, but I would like to have this speech part here. Our best thing here are the parents of the people that get married, arguing about whose name a future kid will take. There was a case that they pretty much fighting till the baby was about to become Christian, and the priest just kicked them out and gave a name he wanted.
The come after me, I'm a man, I'm 40 line was perfect! 🤣🤣🤣
3:30
Objector 100%
Do School stereotypes pleaseee
"The tie noobs"
Shoulda had “Never misses a game” where he’s watching a sporting event rather than the wedding 🥲
4:41 The Monica Geller of DP (Friends fans will know what that reference means ;D)
5:43 love the subtle will smith reference
Ain't nobody realize that they copied friends on the worst case scenario
I’m definitely the tie noob. Every time my family goes to a wedding my dad always ties our ties for me and my brother.
8:52 nice rederence
My birthday is July 18th the heat sucks but atheist I have a pool
Maybe the next stereotype video should be office stereotypes😂😂
Do school stereotypes!

I never thought that Alexa Bliss would be in a dude perfect vid bro
I wonder if Ty got that “circle” speech from I now pronounce you chuck and Larry. Rob Schneider did something similar.
For dude perfect to get little miss bliss Alexa bliss to be a part of this stereotypes videos, shows you how far they have come, how popular they are, and who all watches their videos and who are fans of theirs. This was hilarious!!!! 😂😂😂😂
For once rage monster defeated
The fact that dp videos are better than marvel movies now is incredible
i love that the “rage monster” section has turned from Ty destroying things, to well choreographed fight scenes. amazing job
Rage monster after seeing bridezilla: Finally a worthy opponent
That OK state reference
The prank brothers laugh was so funny when they did the last thing that they did

during that rage monster and the bridezilla scene after all that did the couple still get married that would be pretty depressing for sparky and yes I know it was fake and all but think about it dude perfect what would happen after that wedding chaos

Love the friends refrence
Ty's rage monster clips have only gotten better and better. I'd love to see him do rage monster in the long awaited school stereotypes(that will never come)
aahhhh the ross twist
This ain't funny anymore....
I’ve never seen so much dedication for a video that had absolutely nothing funny in it. Really unfunny. Alexa is still hot though.
😂
I guess since y’all are kid friendly you can’t show it but don’t act like we all don’t know about the “one who can’t handle their alcohol.”
is that alexa bliss as the bride
Loved the “I’m a man I’m 40”😂
😂😂😂😂
Man you make this video right after I go to a wedding
🙂
The “I’m a man I’m 40” quote is so iconic, outdoor weddings in TX summers should be illegal, and great venue, I visited last year ❤😂
The budget for this video is more than my family makes in two years
Pls do more zillas like basszilla etc
Best video
6:02 You know... 6:49 We have two rage monsters now.
Yeah, but we already mixed quessos 😂

Love Alexa Bliss
0:06 The BTS Army when the boys will embark on mandatory military service
Dude Perfect I dare you to make a football stereotypes and it has to be funny😂
7:04 why a wip sound
Rage monster vs Bridezilla K.O. - Bridezilla wins
this ones great but i am realy wanting a thanksgiving one
🤣😂
Funny, as per Dude Perfect usual. But not liking the Bible getting soaked/damaged just to film the Scorcher Wedding clip (5:06); that's crossing a line with me. I don't keep mine in a glass jar or anything, but to purposely let one get damaged like that just for entertainment - that's hard for me to watch with a smile on my face. Tell me truthfully that it's actually a leather-bound copy of an English-Latin Dictionary and as the saying goes "... your people and my people will be one tribe again." (Actually, I don't know who said that.)
can you pls do back to school Stereotypes just for me
I live so close to your where house
ANOTHER RAGE MONSTER!
beautiful photography and the wedding itself
*THE BRIDE HAS ENTERED THE CHAT*
Ok you need to add that guy who proposes at someone else’s wedding and steals the whole day
It’s been years and Dude Perfect still makes awesome videos.  Great to see Alexa Bliss in the video.
This was great and different, first time the rage monster met his match. Excellent
bridezilla 😂😂😂😂😂
would y’all show up to my wedding??
Love how literally everybody is ignoring the mike gundy quote
i unsubscribed and disliked the video cause they had the wedding girl flip   Tyler over
Can the dudes perfect throw a clothes hanger from far and hang the hanger ? i think this is challenging.
It’s the Pete Weber quote before the rage monster that got me 😂😂
Who else got the reference to the show Friends at 8:47 it was hilarious
Not the cake
hi i am from india . you guys made parent stereotype first and then wedding . lol
Finally someone defeated the rage monster 👹  And Tyler should be in the Olympics 🤣
“You keep my wife’s name out your mouth!!” The reference
Rage Monster > That Random Girl
“Congarts on the wifey bro”😂😂😂😂
Where did you get Alexa Bliss to go in your video?!
Stereotype 27 defeat of the rage monster
🤣🤣 the Pete Weber 5:45 Perfect spot for it
Carnival stereotypes???
I love the FRIENDS references
Wait wait wait… is that Alexa bliss 😅😅
I was The Emotional Wreck at my Sisters wedding
yall too funny
Did you do this because sparky got married??
So, the fainting thingy, my Sister In Law's maid of honor was locking her knees during the ceremony, and you could see the color drain from her face, the last thing people were seeing before she collapsed was someone offering her some water.
Y’all should make a IPhone games battle, or like put it in the gaming category for OT
someone should've hit the griddy on the dance circle🤣
Do cruising stereotypes!!
Bridezilla is part of rhat
Anyone noticed the friends reference with the i take you rachel instead of i take you Emily
It took an wwe wrestler to take down the rage monster
Not the friends reference
not having the camera noclip into the backrooms at 9:48 was a missed opportunity
Stereotypes are my favorite!!!!!!! Overtime is a close second, but I think that this is one of the funniest videos on the entire channel 😂😂😂😂
Bridezilla was cute..:)
maybe you should do school stereotypes
Hey me and my dad were at church this Sunday and it was comunión and it seemed like everyone was racing to be first u should do a church stereotype,and include that.

A cruise ship stereotype vid would be super fun
The friends reference was perfect

4:40 Bliss
Ty sucks
My dad is a pastor, and he lost it with the pastor stereotypes 😂 This is probably my favourite stereotype video, my whole family laughed through almost the entire video!
Lol the friends joke
The Mike Gundy quote at 5:30 is legendary
Rage monster is the most iconic thing about the stereotypes  😂
Alexa bliss?
I've watched the awkward unity tradition at my sister's wedding. They used sand and... I just don't get it. -,-
Can u plz do a horse riding stereotypes i akways have asked and been a sub for almost 4 and a half years
I think the wedding planner said a bad word…
You should do night time seotypes
LOVE the bridezilla!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
My favorite part was when the Rage Monster said “It’s Rage Monsterin’ Time!” And then Rage Monstered all over the place.
Mike Gundy reference was spectacular.
Subtle, but accurate - the dad reads his toast from paper, the best man/maid of honor read it off their phone.
balkan weddings are better
10:23  We all know that his true match is Cardboard T. Swift
Anyone else notice those Sports quotes during the Rage Monster/Bridezilla scene?! LOVED THEM!
I just imagine the rage monster tackled her and just a rip in space time
The rage monster should of been the camera man that gets denied food 😂😂

It’s been 7 years and Tyler can still do the rage monster flawlessly
Whoa! Alexa Bliss?! 😍😍 was not expecting that! 😯
The friends joke 🤣🤣
the friends throwback when he said “I john, take rachel..”
Emotional breakdown is 10000% me
5:51 ok for real though that takes a lot of obliviousness/audacity, reaction almost sorta justified
Nice 😂
My dad just turned 40 so I get the,”I’m a man,I’m forty”thing cause he says it all the time
As soon as I saw Alexa bliss I knew it was her, great person for a video. Love the video!

If men and women are equal, when a man beats a woman, everyone calls the man a coward.  But when a woman beats a man, why don't you condemn that woman? Then feminists have condoms on their mouth?
Wait... Alexa Bliss?
Ty Is Amazing
“The bride has entered the chat!” 😂
Happy to see Alexa Bliss in a white dress💖

Not liking the violence jokes. I’ve noticed more of the “all out brawl” jokes in the stereotypes episodes in recent years. It always puts a damper on an otherwise funny series 🤷‍♂️  just my thoughts

And that's all it took for the rage monster to calm down. To be thrown into cake to eat it.
The bridezilla throw was golden!! 😂😂😂
Everyone who watched the entire video just to see rage monster
I feel like most people aren't gonna get the Friends reference but I love that they added it.
Yeah if I ever get married it's gonna be at the courthouse and then we'll go out to dinner with friends.
Never have a thought that I’d see Alexa bliss in this 😂

Is Alexa Bliss in this video
not a lot of heart in this one dudes
The Rage Monster character development continues to evolve, 👏👏👏
Who would want a Rage Monster Stereotype?! The basic Rage Monster The Dude Perfect Rage Monster The Bridezilla Rage Monster The Tantrum Rage Monster (a child raging) The Passive Aggressive Rage Monster (clearly raging, but doing their best not to show it) The Revenge Rage Monster (only raging on one person or thing) The Wait to Rage Rage Monster (waiting for the right moment to rage) The Random Rage Monster (anything sets them off) The Hockey Rage Monster (a brutal hockey player) The Nerd Rage Monster (using the internet to rage)
The Friends reference lol "I take thee Rachel."
5:45 Pete Weber reference??
Not funny
like
As a Miami based Wedding studio, I felt that so much of this, but especially the scorcher wedding. Had a bride who did a noon wedding with a mirrored walkway outdoors mid July, and the sun reflecting off of the mirror made the flower girl fall down and the ring bearer cry. Not to mention, I was sweating so much that I couldn't see the pictures I was taking.
these guys are the real life grown ups movie
Love how dp doesn't buy into the woke garbage
Love the Mike Gundy reference lol.
The friends references lol
Darn i was  3 days late! But im glad you guys are still doing stereotypes 🤣🤣😁😁😁 And is sure are heck tyler and his rager monster moments never gets old 😂🤣🤣🤣
Can someone tell me the song that dp use  This is where legends are made
Why have Alexa bliss in the video do wrestling stereotypes or basketball game stereotypes
Why is this the best action movie I've seen in years?
Bridezilla....
I never thought I would see the day where the rage monster finally gets taken down  Bridezilla is the true champion lol
Dude perfect
7:16 🙃It's a mixture of scenes. Because she put her left hand under Tie's body and the right hand over Tie's body. I don't know how she lifted him over the Groom's cake and threw him over it without any special fighting moment. She just put her arms and grab his body like they are in a real HONEYMOON.😂But at the end Tyler ruined the wedding🤣Tyler demonsrated that he can do the Rage Monster Act UNTIL THE DEATH OF HIM🤣What an entertaing video dudes🥰
What about the dinner disrupter cause that’s who I was. I dropped my water glass on my salmon and it shattered everywhere
This rage Monster was the best
“Who do you think you are, I am” XD classic video
Wait is that WWE wrestler Alexa bliss???
Is that Alexa bliss
The dancing circle is spot on lol
Why did i find this just now?!?!
Alexa Bliss killed it in this video!!!
That wort case scenario was taken from the show friends
Forgot the hungover groomsmen which me n the bros are def are
“WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE I AM!” I love that reference!!
And Ofcourse tha RAGE MONSTER 6:03
Soaking it in it goes so fast looool
I got 1 more elustration:
This is hilarious! I would love to see a bat mitzvah stereotypes! Haha!
Disappointing video totally happened to me. Just like that. It was bad. Cost was ballpark too.
Bring back the rage monster
Nice friends reference with the worst case scenario
Bro the ad as ty became the rage monster 💀

BFFR. Don’t try to replace/add a new rage monster. Ty only
I'm glad they brung back the stereotypes series
That on girl looked like Alexa bliss
You should do amusement park stereotypes
july 18th is my birthday
Thanksgiving stereotypes???
I worked in the banquets department at The Carolina Inn, for a couple of years. That's two to five weddings a weekend. The ONE thing that I could be sure of, without fail, is that 'Don't Stop Believing' by Journey would get played at the reception. Every. Single. Wedding.
Rage Monster and Bridezilla all the way
Theme park stereotypes next??
do a video of mountain biking stereotypes
Love the Friends reference! Only thing missing was the classic reception line dancing 😂
Never thought the Rage Monster would get a double feature, let alone be defeated
Do hockey stereotypes
Having Garrett lose the ring was a nice little throwback to metal-detector battle 😂
I like the friends reference with the I take u Rachel
ALEXA BLISS
I can’t believe a women defeated the rage monster.
This was a great video Top tier
The rage monster lost a fight and it was incredible
“Congarts On The Wifey Bro!!!!!!!” I started dying 😂
This is the best stereotypes
The friends reference Will never not be one of the funniest things ever
The video came out well I was on my way to a wedding
The perfect verse… Genesis 3:16. Look it up😂
You guys should make bathroom stereotypes next
Alexa bliss was hilarious
I just realized that’s Alexa bliss from wwe
“Who do you think you are? I AM!!”  “Come after me! I’m a man, I’m 40!!”  Love that these were included in the Rage Monster scene 😂
Is that Alexa bliss?
It would have been better if Alexa Bliss gave ty a sister Abigail into the cake I would also like to see ty and Beth Phoenix in a rage monster battle
So true
I would like to see tourist stereotype
*How to tie a tie, with me Ty*
Did anyone else get the bowling reference at 5:46?
1:45 thats 100% me

Me - That girl looks a lot like Alexa Bliss (30 seconds later) Me - Ohhhhhhhh
ALEXA BLISS FROM WWE
As a Texan I feel the July 18 3 o’clock outdoor wedding
I think you guys should do school stereotypes or teenager stereotypes😊
The og rage monster would have one
They really tried to sneak a FRIENDS joke past me
The rage monster is back at it again but this time, new challenger appears; Bridezilla. I cannot wait for the ultimate battle : Rage monster vs bridezilla
this makes me never want to get married
ok genuine question how did you fit the "WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE I AM" thing in and also why did you do that- and why do i love it so much!
I love the Friends references
WAS THAT ALEXA FROM WWE?
Awesome video! Stereotypes are my favorite!
SCHOOL STEROTYPES!!!!!!!!

This video was posted on my uncle’s actual marriage
Alexa bliss and dude perfect?????
I need more WWE collabs with dude perfect! Love this!
The most valid rage monster

All jokes aside, I hope Ty is OK from that awkward landing on the cake 🤣
YOU GUYS SHOULD TOTALLY DO FOOTBALL  STEREOTYPES (american)
By far my favorite stereotype video
Random Alexa Bliss cameo
You should do highschool stereotypes or something like that
You should make boat stereotypes
HOW CAN THE BRIDE BEAT THE RAGE MONSTER
I love these stereotype videos! I’m laughing so hard that I started to cry! My daughter was confused! 😂😂😂

The rage monster has been defeated

The rage monster always gets me
Where’s the NPC?
“And the bride has entered the chat” -Cody Jones
I'm the tie noob
If u want to see school stereotypes  👇
July 18th is my birthday
Alexa bliss was the wifezilla
To be fair, I wore a tie every day for 15 years and I still can’t tie one successfully without watching a video first.
I'll never get married again ever
This is the funny thing I have ever seen 😂
6:49 seeing Alexa bliss going bridezilla reminds me of when Bayley turned on Sasha Banks on September 4, 2020
"I didn't talk to you since the MySpace days man" im dying
bridezilla is new LOL
ALEXIS BLISS. She should do more with Dude Perfect.
Hi dp I am in love with you
Well done Timbits!
Here goes, I know a lot of people would love to meet you but there's a YouTuber called *The Stewart Fam* and Evan is wearing a *_Dude Perfect_* wrist band that's he's not going to take off till he meets you. 😊  So thought I'd try give him a "shout out." 🤗 with 10K comments   Great vid 👍🏻🤗 here's hoping one of the team sees this message within the 10k comments. 😄  I can live in hope lol 😂
What a blessing!
I wonder how meny people got the "I'm a man I'm 40"
It wouldn't been a wedding without The Rage Monster
As a wedding videographer who has seen a lot of wedding videos. Spot on for that part
This are getting pretty bad
We’re is panda I am disappointed
The rage was funny😂😂😂 the fact that Tyler knock on the chair was funny lol
The wedding video had me cryin 😢🤣
Forgot the one where none of the guys want to participate in the garter toss😅
Next Stereotypes: Hotels or Fast Food
I've never really liked the "rage monster" so it was incredibly satisfying to see Ty get flipped into the cake!
Love your video
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE, I AMMMM -most amazing line in history
Dude Qatar
I feel like the ring with garret was a throwback to the metal detector video when he lost his wife’s ring
Love the F.R.I. E.N.D.S Easter egg😂
alexa bliss?
I love these Stereotypes so much 😂 it’s so funny 😂😂😂😂
It's hard to hold a candle in the cold November rain.
I love watching this one
I love Alexa bliss
8:49 i think they copied friends when Ross said the same thing
Tie noob reporting in, I have to watch a youtube video every time I need to tie one.
Garret finaly find is weeding ring!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thanksgiving stereotypes next? 🤔
8:47 My two sisters are named Emily and Rachel, so this took on a whole new meaning for me.
For my wedding, my appendix was removed the night before because it was about to burst. So maybe "worst case scenario"?
the very beginning the crying men.  Hilarious
U could do the rise and just throw a bunch of rice on them :)
I was getting sugar - Maroon 5 Vibes 😂😂😂😂
incredible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I am the bridezilla 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
bride has entered the chat 😂😂
yooooo the 7:15 shot was epic
With New Parent Stereotypes 4 months ago and now Wedding Stereotypes you can really feel the userbase/creators aging.
how have these guys not done a hockey stereotypes
Loved the Pete Weber reference!
throuout this whole video I was like is that alexa bliss no maybe yes so I googled it and yes

8:51 FRIENDS  😂

I love this stereotype ❤
Alexa😍 Oh and this vid is frickin hilarious as always
4:30 Ty hit the doggy with the scanner
Got to say Lexi Kaufman Cabrera a.k.a. Alexa Bliss totally killed that bridezilla part and her whole role in the video! It's like she was born an actor, and a wrestler of course!!!😍
The rage monster finally got bested😂😂😂🤲
The suit struggles!

I'm the tie noob. I always have trouble with ties.
WHAT A TWIST
The rage monster has struck again 😂  6:03
The references, just the reference
The bride runway and killing the scene is very Hollywood
8:55 I can tell the worst case scenario is telling the truth of the man cheating…I think the pastor can just preach

i am dude and my friend is also a dude for life
Note to self. Never ruin Alexa Bliss wedding
Seriously

Finally... Someone Beat the Rage Monster
I KNEW EVENTUALLY THERE WAS GONNA ANOTHER RAGE MONSTER
My heart broke into pieces along with that beautiful blue guitar
The fact that Alexa Bliss was here
Alexa Bliss looks amazing!
After 7 years it took a bride to end range monster! History is never wrong!!
6:52 better Tyler marry her by prefect rage monster
I’m a DJ and see all. This is a silly video of the extremes but I’ve unfortunately see fainters, I think you guys missed the flower bro though. That was a very fun part of a wedding I had last year
" Don't mention it "  Mia Codm 2022
bruh my mom's youngest sister has a wedding in 5 days this is so perfect timing
Is it me or is that Alexa bliss
Was that Alexa bliss
_i Like_ *RAGE MONSTER* 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
what about the twins wedding
I really loved this wedding stereotype Alexa bliss is with dude perfect and some other new rage monster and bridezilla
That friends reference cracked me up:D
Maybe you could do Job or Hotel stereotypes
First was new parent now is wedding
Hãy đến với Việt Nam
2:59 Nice DP you added a Captain Underpants "Quiet Fives" Reference
Amazing 😂😂
THEY GOT ALEXA!!!!
6:33 "World Star...We out here" ROFLMAO
I waited only for rage monster😅
This video made me realise just how preposterous weddings are and in the unlikely event that I did get married, it would be in black to annoy everyone.
That was pretty epic. 😂🎉
We got some FRIENDS scene
Here we go again WWE Superstar Alexa Bliss is going crazy again😂😂😂
I swear the rage monster always makes me laugh xD
Alexa ❤❤❤
No military wedding?
2:53 I wonder if that was real 😂
We need "Balkan/Romanian Wedding Stereotypes"
Rage Monster battling the groomsmen, and Bridezilla were both incredible!!
This would have been 10x better if it went in chronological order 😬
ALEXA BLISS!!!
The friends reference though 😂❤️❤️
I was the fainter. I fainted in one of best friends from colelge wedding as a groomsmen
Took me so long to recognize that was alexa
Why didn't I notice until the "Rage Monster" that the bride either looks like or is Alexa Bliss?
As usual rage monster
Next stereotype ideas, soccer, hockey, football, new years, Halloween, 4th of July, sleepover, fair, vacation
Can't wait for the Behind the Scenes
A MONSTER TRUCK THERE WOW
TIE NOOOB
Bridezilla needs some work :D
Bridezilla killed it😂😂
That was extream
Wonder how many of dp subs actually know who alexa bliss is lol
That FRIENDS bit was spot on 😂😂😂

8:58 best crossover everrr😭😂😂😂
Who else is here beacouse brandon
Congarts on the wifey 💀
True
Lexi as Bridezilla was too funny hahahahahahaha
No way Alexa bliss was in here🎉
Please post the failed moments
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I almost woke up my family at 1am in the morning when I saw “The Tie Noob” because I almost threw a tantrum after watching like 10 tie knot videos to no success literally one week ago… honestly, this was your best of the stereotype videos yet! I look forward to your next one, even though I doubt it will be topped!
They got Alex blis
I love your videos they just make me feel joy inside and forget about everything that’s hard in life.Thank you.
Ty and sparks as the prank bros was the best
Rage monster is iconic
World star😂
Bro first time the Rage Monster got clapped.
Prank brothers/ best man 🤭🤣
IS THAT ALEXA BLISS?!?!?!?!??????!????
Alexa Bliss continues to show why she cute
Is this what weddings are like in Texas?
W vid
One of my favorite hobbies is to edit videos so the disappointing video bothers me.
i love this video
Anyone else catch the Mike Grundy reference 😂 “Come after me, I’m a man. I’m 40.”
Whoa whoa, Alexa Bliss?? The collab/crossover/whatever I never knew I needed. :O
been watching for years and yall amazing me everytime
Come after Me! I’m a Man! I’m 40!
only legends got the mike gundy reference
This was hilarious!
The action scene straight outta movie
I love this This is hilarious and make me laughing❤️😂😂🥰
Looking 4 the music they play on the video
“And smote the nail into his temple… he died” 😂😂😂😂😂😂
When my friend saw Alexa in a dude perfect video I edmidietly watched it
still a litlle torn on yall ruining a bible for a vid like yall better than that
They slipped in a friends reference 😂
Hahaha the Friends reference with “Rachel” 😂. Best Stereotypes video ever.

This is trashhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The never ending veil 😂
They really spilled water on the Bible bro💀
I liked the friends show references
That Pete Webber reference 🤌🏼
Lol I was literally at a wedding yesterday and I was watching a video to tie my tie…never got it

I had to do a double take to make sure that was Alexa bliss
Is she flirting with the camera man?
I feel special! This was posted on my wedding day !
ALEXA?!?
ALEXA BLISS!!
Alexa bliss came in clutch
Rage monster vs  bridezilla their battle will be legendary
What is their budget
1:43 fortnite goku floss
Me reí como nunca con el rage monster, sin duda el mejor stereotypes que han hecho, la producción es increíble
Dude Perfect it’s back babyyyyyyyyyyy
Dude the ragemonster part was epic 5:52
Bro why does he look like John seed tho
That’s gotta be racist… only black guy is the one that can dance
Nice touch with bridezilla
the mike gundy quote
Is that Alexa Bliss? 😳
Iss that lexi
Alexa bliss in the video? Nice
Liberal women are not marriage material. They are used up and no man of value marries those cockroaches. Their agenda is to break the family unity. Never befriend those low lives.
Alexa bliss ❤️
Best one yet!
You guys should do movie theaters stereotypes
Is that Alexa Bliss???
My sister just got married today lol
I literally had to go to a wedding yesterday
Who is that blonde girl with the pink hair strand that played the bride???? I’ve never seen her before. Ftr I love a girl who can fight. AND SHE DRIVES A TRUCK!! She’s perfect.
Who's here because of the rage monster?
The mike gundy quote had me rolling 😂
How to tie a tie with ty should be a channel in itself, I'd watch it
8:49 just watched that episode lol
Rage Monster vs. Bridezilla.  The matchup we didn’t know we needed in this world.
I wish there was the left at the alter
Alexa Bliss
I love the Pete Weber reference lol
First to catch the pin oak that ty called a red oak?
The Rage Monster will always be my favorite..Lol!🤣
Love the Pete Webber quote by TY! Who do you think you areee? I am! Soo awesome Ty. I'm a huge bowling fan so it's so cool to hear a quote from one of the bowlers
for our school news channel, we did school stereotypes, totally based off of you guys! i love these
Can't believe you got The Residents to DJ the wedding!
So you really got Alexa Bliss to do this video with you that’s rad.
Can I say how he used a pro bowlers famous line. Pete Weber has his famous line of “Who do you think you are I am!”
john's about to spend 5 more seasons then get back with rachel
👰🏼‍♀👰🏼‍♀👰🏼‍♀👸🏻🤵🏼‍♂🤵🏼💗💖💍
The friends reference caught me off guard lol
yeah but, we already mixed quesos.....
bros had wwe superstar Alexa Bliss there
*Rage monster enters the chat* Me: welp I guess the weddings ruined🤷‍♀️ *Bridezilla enters the chat*  Me: OH WHAT THE-

I worked at weddings and this is completely accurate
Best man speech is on point 😂
This is a vid I NEED a behind the scenes on the makin of it. Lol I’m very very interested
6:09 this is unacceptable
ALEXA BLISS
hey dp you should do office job stereotypes
No way the rage monster has been beaten
Loved how y’all had the WWE superstar in there
You guys actually got Alexa Bliss to join y'all. Nicely done.
Ok everything went well but Sparky's acting is cringe
Weirdest collab with Alexa Bliss.
alexa bliss
This is dope! Do archery stereotypes next!
Use the pretied ties from obertime
I liked the friends reference in their I John take Emily “ I john take rachel”
e

School stereotypes please
I cant believe Alexa bliss was in this video
Sucks I’m probably never gonna experience any of these…
1:48 I wish I could do something like this
What the heck… this is awesome
DP MUST DO HOTEL STEREOTYPES: Imagine the options, Loud neighbor, ghost neighbor the foodie etc.
Alexa 😍
I even saw alexa bliss
Funeral Stereotypes
Alexa bliss
The subtle Will Smith reference was🔥
rage monster is the best
8:46 FRIENDS!
How did everybody miss that Mike Gundy reference?
Wait if the wedding girl also can rage like the rage monster, does that mean the bride cheated on him with rage monster? 🤨
now i wanna see church stereotypes ;)
I that Alexa bliss from wrestling
Do sleep over stereotypes
the wedding video part 🤣
THEY GOT ALEXA IN A VIDEO!!!! MY WORLDS HAVE COLLIDED
no one got the friends refrence?
IM just a kid so I'm not Sure I'm any of them (Still love the video!) but where are the bloopers at the end? (Maybe the slow flour girl but I've only been the flower girl once.)
“who do you think you are, I AM” reference was gold🤣
Can we talk about alexa bliss from wwe
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
Finally another stereotype video. How about a school stereotype I saw someone say it in the Halloween one
Ngl, I´m just here for Alexa Bliss
i just saw a sedding 2 days ago
Loved the video
“The bride has entered the chat”
Still can't believe there hasn't been a college stereotypes.
I think you should do hockey stereotypes next🏒
As someone who both lives and has been to an outdoor wedding in California I can confirm that’s whq a scorcher wedding is like
I’m here from @BDE because in one of the vids on his reddit they clipped Alexa Bliss on dude perfect
That's funny, my cousin recently got married.
loved the friends reenactment
Love the friends reference
snuck in the mike gundy i’m 40 joke

What was wrong at 8:51
3:08
3:06
I think Bridezella has replaced rage monster🤣
Only wwe fans know
Can you make a food sterotypes
As a wedding DJ, I can truly say I have experienced all of these. Except the over the top DJ.
I'm only like Alexa Bliss 😂😂
“Who do you think you are!, I am!”, only true gamers will understand
Video Idea: School Stereotypes (that would be so funny) Tyler getting a detention and then raging!
You guys should go ice hockey stereotypes
Request: Amusement park stereotypes
Pete weber...greatest bowling moment of all time and iconic quote "who do you think you are, I am"
Wwe superstar Alexa bliss

Featuring Alexa Bliss 😍
😢
6:00 what's wrong with them scheduling a wedding on MY birthday at mid afternoon? 🤣

Alexa bliss!
These stereotypes will never get old without a rage monster
Can't tell you how much nostalgia this stereotype theme song brings
I never knew locking ur knees could be so bad..
The “WORLD STAR” was too funny
So funny
I’m surprised they got another rage monster
7:00 sneakers at a wedding
I'd love to poison your food
Was that a friends reference!?
Yo Marco needed to get sturdy in the circle
I'm definitely The Tie Noob. Never did like wearing ties for that reason.
I bet you Ty is always calm because of how much stuff he gets to destroy in these videos xD
Bro be Jackie Chan Jr. with that chair.
Leah and Rachel

Congarts on the wifey bro!! 🎉
4:41 hey is that Alexa Bliss?
My fabrate is bridezilla
You should do school stereotypes  Like so dude perfect can see this
Props to Bethany toney for standing in the rain for this video
Best rage sequence of every stereotypes video 👀
Alexa Bliss?😮
Oh no the circle forming
Haha
This video was 🔥 dude perfect X WWE superstar Alexa Bliss
I'm suprised bachelor night was not part of this. Although bachelor night stereotypes could be it's own video.
My dads wedding was the same day this was posted
Bridezilla😂
Gotta live this video with two rage monsters

We NEED Funeral Stereotypes!

Alexa Bliss! 😍
Ty got outdid by a girl

My favorite video with Alexa Bliss the RAGE MONSTER I love that video it was so funny 🤣🤣🤣
During my wedding I was so nervous, the preacher started to speak and when I heard “Do you take this man to be your husband?” I replied with “I do” but then the preacher started laughing because he wasn’t finished speaking yet, he still had to go through the whole “in sickness and in health” bit and I jumped the gun 😂😂 Forever embarrassed but what a way to start things off
I am the ,, Never went to a Wedding party but went to 15 funerals"
I love the friends
Alexa Bliss ?
7:10
Imagine being a man and crying at a wedding
Was that a FRIENDS reference for the worst case scenario?
That cracked me up man!!😂

This the best one yet 😭
ALEXA BLISS? 🥰
7:26 vehicular manslaughter

Best part of these stereotypes are the rage monsters 😂
Okay well, nice job but I hate that there was two rage people. Ty is the only rage monster!
Haha I love this is so funny!🤣🤣😁
Y'all really got Alexa Bliss in here thats amazing great vid too
Tyler vs roman reigns at wrestlemania!! lol

Very cool that you had alexa bliss in the video
Can you do thanksgiving stereotypes
I deeply appreciated the friends reference
I love how Alexa Bliss is just bodying everyone in the bridezilla scene
Hi
The Fainter is so funny 🤣
The scorcher wedding is my favourite because i have been in one recently i had to g sit in a shade wearing a vest only😅
“Who do you think you are? I am!”. Anyone else catch this reference?
Alexa going off
“Maybe we aren’t meant to be together” “Yeah, but we already mixed quesos”
Bridezilla was the best.  Please find an excuse to bring back Alexa for a future Stereotype.
body slam ty again alexa but through a table
Did anyone notice that Alexa bliss from wee is in this video
Absolutely loved it😂😀
Alexa Bliss Anihilated everyone on that party.
Alexa bliss in dude perfect… that’s weird
ALEXA BLISS!

I’m just here for Alexa bliss ol brideZilla
I'm a man I'm 40. inspirational quote.
I didnt not know that alexa bliss is in dude perfect!!!!!!
Yey lexi 🤙
alexa bliss
Wouldn’t be a classic dude perfect stereotype video without the rage monster 😂😂❤
"the bride has entered the chat."
Who do u think u are i am 🤣
As a wedding videographer that shoots high end weddings on RED cinema cameras, the bad wedding video part was both painful and hilarious 😂
Pretty funny!
ALEXA BLISS!
I cant believe Alexa bliss is in this
was that alexa bliss if it was how did you get her?😀
Skate park stereotypes!!! Anyone with me?? 😅
How did they get alexa bliss
What is that alexa bliss
I love that alexa made a suplex
As a wwe fan and love watching dude perfect it’s fun seeing Alexa bliss also what’s gonna happen with bray Wyatt and her
This video came out on my wedding day, and I appreciate the timing
It’s funny you said July 18. That was my original wedding date before covid it. I’m actually glad that didn’t happen because it would have been a scorcher wedding.
WWE in the house!💪👊🤼
By far the best stereotype ever 😁
Bridezilla was worse than rage monster
9:07 the twins from Terraria?? YOO
This video was  amazing😭😭😭
I can't be the only one asking this, is that Alexa Bliss?
Ehhh yooooo sup
Jo moma
I love you guys. you are the best

Bro Alexa bliss was the LAST thing I was expecting to see in this video
"Hey guys I'm ty welcome to how to tie a tie with me... ty" - ty 2022
Take the Rachel 😭😭😭
Dream wedding 🤩
why did the thumbnail look like an ad thumbnail to me...?
I LOVED TWO RAGE MONSTERS!!!!!
U guys got a new subscriber
They finally did it, I have been waiting for this video
This is comedy🤣
Me sees Rage Monster for the 1654000005th time: ahaha classic! 😂 Also me whatching bridezilla: Hang on what?! They re two now??!! 😳
What a funny video😅
I remember that someone commented that they wanted this stereotype video to come out
Once went to a wedding the father of the bride actually had a company sponsor the toast...it was gloriously horrible and I couldn't contain my laughter
Where's my invite lol
Can we just acknowledge how much money they spend just for our entertainment   Thanks dudes!
After creating over 200 wedding movies in the past this is spot on.
Getiing a 20 seconds ad right before the rage-monster. Feels bad
I got engaged on the day this was released. I can't wait for my wedding day!  My favorite part: "Were you born in a Tie Shop? Pink Tie Loser!!!!" 😂😂😂😂
That was funny! Quite the production.
You should do school stereotypes
OHHHHHHH
Rage monster has met his match
Im here just for the Rage Monster
4:56 that looks like WWE wrestler Alexa Bliss
Bridezilla stole the show
One of the best stereotypes
Fun fact: if I ever get married I will be hiring a mariachi band
alexa bliss??!
"I forgot to record the rage monster"
“Who do you think you are, I AM”
I’m suit struggles for sure! Had pants that were 5 inches too short one wedding 😂
They should do a student or teacher stereotypes
Garret and his wedding ring 😂
Funeral stereotypes next! Y'all put the FUN in FUNeral
Unfortunately I'm the worst man. I'm terrible at public speaking and weirdly I didn't have a hollywood ending and completely bombed
Really want to see some behind the scenes of that Rage Monster/ Bridezilla sequence.  Dude Perfect Plus vid please?
Not the rage monster at a wedding 😂😂
metro stereotypes
6:02 SUPER SAIYAN MODE ACTIVATED
the friends reference 😂
and who word put up a video for 1500 dollars
Little Pete Weber quote thrown in there gotta love it lol 🎳
Tyler aka the rage monster never gets old and also the scream

BRIDEZILLA! 😂😂😂🤔 finally! someone that can deal with the rage monster
true W w
Dude Perfect and Mr. Beast should definitely make a video together. ✨Legendary Collab ✨
POV Me waiting for the rage monster
He’s I was waiting for them
Imagine if Ty and Sparky had a fight in the stereotypes.
The classic Pete Weber line…
“world star we out here” 😂
im here bc my stepson just sent me this video. we got married on the 8th, the same day this video came out. We were the awkward unity candle. So windy and the candles wouldn’t stay lit. But the rest was lit 🔥 🤘🏼
Best one yet
Having Alexa Bliss is a huge w in this video
bridezilla🤣🤣🤣
Happy Thanksgiving from Canada
Loved how y’all put the show FRIENDS as the worst case scenario
Y’all should do something like high school stereotypes next, I’d love to see how creative you can get with that.
ALEXA BLISS?!??
When they said I take Emily but he actually said Rachel that scene was from Friends when Ross was getting married again😂
Did y’all see bray Wyatt? 😂🤣
Alexa Bliss  😘😘😘
We flung m&ms at the cake until we finally hit it. Then we played football in our tuxes haha
i can't get the part of the (Friends) reference.. man love the video..
ya the suit struggles ughhh, since I live in a Muslim country and our weddings are very different from American and European weddings it was nice seeing other types pf wedding stereotypes.
No one’s gonna talk about the cake joke
"This thing only has one weakness." Death star trench run.  Lol
I ship rage monster and bridezilla
Gonna be honest that video was hilariously funny too many   favorite parts were alexa bliss screaming ITS NOT YOUR WEDDING and the graphic said bridzilla to the wedding creator suplexing a guy through climbing up to a monster truck the groom said the wrong person to be married name  So so funny i enjoyed it well done dude perfect
Best stereotypes video yet!!!
Because all of your viewers are married.
Real men join to see what the rage monster will do this time 😂
the dream wedding was actualy like thallumala
Come after me ,I'm man,I'm 40  Great sport quote and that part had me crying laughing
🔥🔥🔥🔥
You posted this video on my dads wedding day
Alexa Bliss 😍
Love the Pete weber line at 5:47
4:56 That's ALEXA BLISS right?
Love this
she is a wwe wrestler.
Y’all remember the beach version of this, man nostalgic.
aw yes my favorite stereotypes of all, *the rage monster & bridezilla* 💀
4:59 is that not Alexa bliss from wwe
my 8 and 12 year old kids had no idea what was happening, but I was cracking up
That first one I felt on so many levels of personality. Don't cry at movies, books or when someone dies because I'm resilient like that. But the one wedding I went to I cried my eyes out.
I AM THE TABLE
That’s crazy this was posted on my cousins wedding
Do megachurch stereotypes!!
this was amazing!!!!! y'all absolutely killed it!!!
There's always the rage monster 🤣🤣🤣🤣
On point 😂
THAT'S ALEXA BLISS DAGGOMIT
BIG NEWS the rage monster is defeated and have a female rage monster!!!
Alexa Bliss in this one. Wow....🤩🤩😂😂
Congarts!! 🎉
You need to live a real life and think with your head, and not follow stereotypes
🔥🔥🔥nailed it
Song at 9:09?
At this point they should only do overtime dude perfect just isn’t what it used to be
Do cruise stereotypes
can u make another Stereotype any one
6:41 that’s what sparky gets for being a terrible judge 😅😅😅
ผมเป็นคนไทยชอบดูช่องคุณมาก🎉
Nice twist with the double rage monster
BRIDEZILLA FTW
Who do you think you are I am
As a bowler, thank you for the Pete Weber reference!
amazing
Alexa bliss always a Queen 👑👑👑 of heart 💖💖❤️💖
Really want to know how my teacher Cassie got to be in this video 😅
been watchin since i was a little kid from day one my granny sent me the first vid, 23 now and i have to say that this was some legit acting and i think yall should really consider a comedy series or mini film
“Who do you think you are I am” under appreciated line 😂😂
the fight choreography with the chair was just everything.
Alexa Bliss doesn't deserve this level of mid video
Family stereotypes? Thanksgiving? Just ideas😄
You should make school stereotypes
They think they're slick with 8:47 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  Bridezilla was incorporated so perfectly too! 😂😂😂
when is next ot comming
Birthday stereotypes
Fun fact: this is the first Rage Monster where Ty isnt mad over Cody
love the friends reference
Nobody noticed Emily and Rachel reference? 😂
4:55 hey blonde 😍
"Hi, I'm Ty. Welcome to How to tie a Tie, with me Ty" Im dying 🤣🤣
Bro the rage monster he’s not very emotional
i love that they got the friends refrence
At 4:55 that’s Alexa bliss from wwe
I’m just going to the court house to get married rather than be in debt for paying too much
This made my day since I’m getting married in 5 days. Lol
the bride has entered the chat 🤣
I literally can’t go though a dude perfect video with the mike gundy quote
5:53 nah he got a point. Those who do that are completely insane. Why have it outside so everyone suffers when you can go into a building with a.c.
Tyler:”finally a worthy opponent our battle will be legendary “
I WAS JUST AT A WEDDING ON SATURDAY
The emotional brake down got me ngl 😂btw it's been years tho u made my night happy love u guys ♥️
I have never understood the appeal of weddings, but I really quite enjoyed this video.
Go bliss 🤘🏻
The Pete Weber refranc
4:56 Alexa Bliss?
And the Bride has entered the chat!  Love it!
That Emily and Rachel part from Worst Case Scenario, they got that from the series Friends, where Ross says Rachel instead of Emily.
the thing is I've been waiting to watch one of the stereotype videos for ages
The courthouse wedding with strangers..
When you just wait till the rage monster shows up :D
First rage monster And now bridezilla
Love that reference to Friends
This is the best Dude Perfect stereotypes I've seen
"How to tie a tie with Ty" - AKA: "How to be in a YouTube video in a YouTube video"
the moment i saw alexa i know there is a scene her smack you guys down🤣🤣
6:03-7:36 Everything was hilarious of it
the best stereotype
this is soo funny. i'm loving it. but can i request a video about sleepover stereotypes. 😁 thank you dude perfect.
Hello dude perfect video request school stereotypes  🏫 🏫 🎒 🎒
For those who don't know the worst case scenario was inspired by the tv show F.R.I.E.N.D.S.
GREAT VIDEO 📹 👍 THANKS ❤️
Alexa bliss????????????
HA! I was the tie guy! Missed like 30 mintues of the beginning of the wedding cause youtube failed me lol.
Next level funny
New character unlocked  Bridezilla
Alexa bliss look so badass in this video!!!
alexis bliss, wowee.
Me who has been in a wedding I can say this is very accurate
I knew he was gonna say Rachael when I heard the name Emily 😂

A peaceful wedding turned into a WrestleMania match
What kind of stereotypes: was it?
Alexa Bliss When She Heard The Fiend is Back.

"AND THE BRIDE HAS ENTERED THE CHAT" This line is so fricking funny
Do themepark stereotypes
8:50 I UNDERTOOD THAT REFERNCE!!!!!!!!!!!
Cody Jones: My son wishes you a happy birthday🎉
Alex bliss vs Tylers rage monster
Today is a sad day, for the rage monster has fallen in battle
I've never laughed so hard
Ohh man 😂 the fight part is amazing 🤣
Steriotypes are some of my favorite videos tbh. Comedy gold 👌
"congarts on the wifey bro"
1:32 Garrett looks like my favorite doctor
my cousin actually did leave in a helicopter for his wedding
Who do you guys think will win the Rage Monster or the Bridezilla?
You guys nailed everything
Alexa Bliss in Dude perfect is perfect!
Where the wedding fight happened I’ve been to that location it’s a beautiful place for weddings
Pls make a vid where the bridzilla and the rage monster as a team and just break so much stuff
BRIDEZILLA killed me did not see that coming lol. Great job guys!! Fun video!
I checked this: July 18 at 3:30 PM was literally the hottest point during the year in Dallas
You should do overtime stereotypes
The Bridezilla hip-toss. Nice.
best rage monster until now... and bridezilla... cool name
the mike gundy😭
I can’t believe they got Waifu Bliss to participate! 😍
Is she Alexa bliss??
Next stereotypes have to definitely be baking
Rage moment was lit
And here I am… haven’t been to a wedding 😂
This vid is ott even for dp
Was that a Pete Weber quote I heard there? “Who do you think you are I am” whattt
The rage monster has met his match.
Just seeing the rage monster in dp's stereotypes just makes me happy
WORLDSTAR
The part when he knocks on there chair to kick his face was so funny
someone arrest tys barber
Nobody mentioning the subtle Friends joke? Just me?
After all these years, someone finally defeated the Rage Monster. I really didn't think it was possible. Cheers to Bridezilla/Runaway Bride
Lol 😂 the friends reference 😂
I love the college football “I’m a man I’m 40” reference
The supporting actors/actresses absolutely slayed
Could not stop laughing 😆 🤣
My favorite one yet
This is by far the best stereotype video y'all have done!!! Loved it
The friends reference 😂😂😂
That was crazy bro 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’m just here cuz of Alexa Bliss 😍

Someone finally stopped the rage monster 😳
Definitely my new favorite stereotype video. Died laughing, my cheeks hurt so badly now. ❤❤😂😂❤❤
We gonna ignore the Friends reference😂😂
Loved the friends reference
Tie noob
I've been waiting a long time for a double rage monster scene just like that, but I always thought it would be Cody
not the friends name mix up
the rage monster choreography was the best one yet
Can you do hockey stereo types

It’s really awesome how they put alexia bliss in it and she gave some of her wwe moves in there
I've been to one wedding and it created memories we're not allowed to talk about in our family! 🤣🤣
The last one was an mi-8 transport helicopter
Everyone: enjoying the video Me: THE FONT IS DIFFERENT
The friends reference was on point
That reference to Friends at 8:51 was hilarious 😂
very nice
HUGE MISSED opportunity not having the never ending veil as a joke you kept jumping back to throughout the entire video
*BRIDEZILLA!?!?*
I like brisezilla
Best video. Alexa bliss appearing was badass
Bridezilla got me
Was that alexa bliss?

I loved the Bridezilla! The perfect counterpart to the Rage Monster.
What about the football game scheduled during wedding guy
If you are reading this I hope you have a blessed life.
The part where it was the scene from friends where Ross and Emily are getting married and Ross says Rachel's name at the church instead of Emily's
Loved it. Forgot sound system problems and make up monster.
I was at a wedding yesterday when you posted this and everything about this happened      Ok like half these things didn’t happen
the “I AM” part got me 😂
That's wwe superstar Alexa bliss

Love the video! Could you do church stereotypes?
You’re perfect if you could call me on Tuesday I’ll be the happiest man in the world because I am your biggest supporter and this would be making the world for me I had a 10-year-old adventure with you when I got to meet you I made you a picture and I got nervous person got scared but you guys support me on so many stuff that I do you guys are mortals to me😊😊😊😊😊😊

I love how sparky was more involved with this stereotype video
Finally a new stereotype videoo!!!!!!!
As a wedding video editor, I totally felt that part about the wedding video being so awful. I get terrible footage sometimes and there is nothing I can do about it.  Absolutely hilarious!
-And the bride has entered the chat....... 😂
Was it just me or did you only come here because you saw Alexa bliss tweet on Twitter
Rage Monster v.s. Bridezilla had me ROLLING!😂  GG Dude Perfect, GG.
They absolutely went off on this video. I love the “worse case scenario” and how it used a “friends” reference.
The "Friends" reference😂😂
This is one of the most intense weddings   if I've ever seen one with bribezila and rage monster.🤣
The Pete Weber line was gold
The reference to Mike Gundy’s “I’m a man, I’m 40” speech is phenomenal
Can you guys pls do basketball stereotypes.🙂🏀
Funny how garrat is the one who loses the ring
“Bridezilla” 😂😂😂
not the who do you think you are i am reference
That friends reference was amazing😂
Coby and Cory carried Rage Monster
The awkward unity tradition is a wedding staple.
I can relate to the suit situation
These look so weird to film
And I just got engaged yesterday. Haha. This is great!
Nah the Emily and Rachel was my favorite 😭
PLEASE DO HIGH SCHOOL STEREOTYPES

Dude Perfect should do Doctor Visit Stereotypes
The Objector scene was pure gold the references where top notch!!! 🎳
Wedding video part absolutely killed me. I bet it killed the DP editors too to have to make a terrible video like that 😂

Stereotype videos we need: School Stereotypes Gaming Stereotypes Arcade Stereotypes Party Stereotypes Apocalypse Stereotypes Water Gun Stererotypes Sleepover Stereotypes (Fun Fact Ski Stereotypes is the only stereotype video that does not have the Rage Monster)
Bridezilla and Runaway bride has me dead💀💀
New rage monster in town and it is flawless

I guess Garrett finally found his wedding ring
If you are watching in 2023, you’re a legend
Just when we thought the rage monster couldn't get any better, bridezilla enters the scene.

Every single time I am sad about the money they gave for rage monster 🥲😅💸
the runaway bride is the best!!!
Y’all should make a spot on wheel unfortunate where you have to sleep in a bed with no batteries
nice👍
How ironic that I get married in 13 days and y’all release this NOW 😂😂😂😂
Loved the random WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE I AM
Dude perfect is one channel that our generation has seen age
Subscribe and see magic
I JOHN TAKE THE RACHEL BEST SCENE EVER!
Several parts in this video had me crying laughing! Seen the fainter and awkward speeches several times. I can count on fingers and toes guys who had tie issues.
6:29 is comic gold 😄
She looks like Alexa Bliss
The pitch for this must have been hilarious! “ I need you three to stand outside in the rain in dresses, I need you to wear a suit 3 sizes to small!”
I'd be the tie noob not gonna lie. Great video as always!
Alexa bliss yesss
Love the Friends reference!
GUYS…  SPARKY’S REAL NAME IS KEVIN😱
6:26 This sequence was genius
Not upto the dude perfect standard! Seemed kinda forced
THE MIKE GUNDY QUOTE LOL
When she got in the truck I almost died
*bride has entered the chat*
I’m getting married this week so this was perfectly timed!😂😂😂
The mike gundy quote was the best
What about the wedding crashers like the movie😅
I loved the friends reference 😂
8:50 loved the little tribute to Ross and Emily’s wedding from friends!
Wait Alexa bliss was there 😮
6:02 best rage monster part yet😂😂
🎄🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
As soon as the pastor said Emily, I KNEW the groom was gonna say Rachel
Anybody notice Alexa bliss?
That veil..🤣🤣
That friends reference finished me, I just didn't see it coming

Love the reference to the OKST coach "Come after me Im a man, Im 40!
Alexa bliss 🥰❤️

Daily Reminder: JESUS LOVES YALL ❤️ 💝💗💕💛💝💖💚💓💕❤💌💛💖💝💙💌💓💖💝💗💘
Here for Lexi
I love the friends reference in the worst case scenario!!

This came out the day of my cousins wedding!!🤣🤣🤣
4:30 Ty casually smacks the dogs face
Alexa bliss!!!
Is that Alexa bliss ?
Who am I??  "The one friend that doesn't get invited"
4:42 Alexa bliss!!
Soccer streotypes
This why I choose clip on ties and bows
Bridezilla: *appears*  Rage Monster: “Finally, a worthy opponent. Our battle will be legendary!”
When did dude perfect get WWE star in this video?
8:51 great F.R.I.E.N.D.S. Reference!
Ty with the pete weber who do you think you are i am
Is that alexa bliss?
Spark has been waiting for a long time for that chopper evac! You got the dub brother!
We just not gonna act like they just casually have Lexi Kauffman (Alexa Bliss ) In this video!?
it’s weird because i was at a wedding yesterday😂
You should do cooking stereotypes next.
Alexa Bliss was awesome
What about the guy that only comes for food
This was awesome. The wedding video was such a bitter sweet thing to watch, my wife and I just looked at each other with that, "I know how that feels" look. Our wedding photographer did a terrible job, blurry photos, bad shot, terrible photoshop editing. All around we ended up only developing pictures that other people took on their own cameras.
FINALLY A SECOND RAGE MONSTER.    5:41 Also, Will Smith reference?
Ha the rage monster has met his match! Who will win? Rage monster - like  Bridezilla - comment
The rage monster scene segueing into bridezilla was next level.
Is that alexa bliss?
I'm just here for Alexa Bliss 😍😍
Birthday stereotypes and school stereotypes ???
Hey am I the only one to spot the friends reference 😅 When the groom said Rachel instead of Emily 😂
Waterpark stereotypes
Tyler I have a dude perfect hat,shirt and a poster I love your videos and I got a suggestion for a video and it is sleep over stereotypes that would be a really cool video!!!
🤩
The parts that had Alexa Bliss were my favorite! Some of these stereotypes are true, though! 😂😂😂😂
Hii
Y'all fell off big time... 😔
Hahaha LOVED the friends reference!
The show off is me😂😂😂
5:30 to 7:35 is what you came to see. thank me later.
The “who do you think you are I am” from that bowling video was classic! 😂
Here for Alexa Blizz 🎉
It’s been 7 years and Tyler can still do the rage monster flawlessly. agreed!
This video is just not funny... At all.
The moment I saw "Rage Monster" at 6:05 I immediately clicked the like button on this video
the Oklahoma State “I’m 40 I’m a man” part was genius. Favorite line of the whole video
Lol
This was the funniest video I’ve seen in a long time. Dude perfect is still so relevant and funny! 😂
Alexa bliss!
How is this more intense than gym scenarios?
Yo the fact that they had Alexa Bliss in the video was so cool
The tying a tie video comment "yeah yeah get to the point" is so painfully accurate. Seriously, I don't care about your grampappy teaching you the double windsor in 1987, just SHOW ME THE STEPS
This is by far my favorite 😊
How did they get Alexis Cabrera that’s pretty cool
Alexa Bliss is amazing in this.
Look up JJ flims
HOW IN THE WORLD DID YALL GET ALEXA BLISS
Dude this video was lit!!!!
I have an Idea, how about high school or college stereotypes?
Did they really wet the Bible 😅😮
Where is pool table stereotypes
Alexa bliss i love her ❤️🤗
My mom: can you tell me the definition of something awkward?
Hey dude perfect can you guys do PARTY STEREOTYPES next please.

Ok, just a suggestion. The next stereotype video should be recess football stereotypes.  By the way, love the vid
Was that alexa bliss?
The ok state college reference classic😂
Congarts on the wifey bro!!!
Bro july 18th is my birrhday😂
Is it just me or was the Bridezilla another Rage Monster! Maybe they could add a Ragezilla or something.
This got posted right after my mom wedding a day after
HAHAHAHAHA
ALEXA BLISS🤯🤯
I noticed at the beginning it said Emotional Breakout and at the very end it said Emotional Wreck
Anyone get the friends reference with Emily and Rachel?
Alexa bliss and Ty are the rage monster couple
Rage Monster vs Bride-Zilla. Who wins? My money’s on Rage Monster
Alexa bliss!!
I’m surprised they got a talented break dancing fan tO show off his skills for this video. That’s fire 🔥
I really like Bridezilla and runaway bride
Love how Alexa Bliss was in it
6:29 knock knock who’s there MY FIST!!!
Post the tie video!
Best stereotype ever ❤
Some where quite funny, but the rage monsters scene I think went too far
Pink tie loser
I love the use of the Pete Weber quote
rage monster was great lol
I love this!!!!!!!!!
The worst wedding
The rage monster bever geta old
He’s better than Charlie Damelio
Stereotype video brings back memories 🥺
Never know wedding can be this scary 😂
Man!! And this is why no one wants to marry!! Their worst nightmare may come true!! But still, I think id end up with the Angry Bride one.  it's just my luck.
the come after me, im a man im 40 before the rage monster made me cry laughter, because it is a parody off of Mike Gundy's rage at the press in 2007 for Oklahoma State
Alexa Bliss??? That's awesome!
The dude perfect live was soooo cool and I was in the audience!
Awsome
Rage monster and bridezilla is on fire this time! 😂

7:32 women
Cringey. I don’t know what type of person is enjoying this, but I don’t wanna be your friend.
Alexa is the best

Bridezilla? Who is that?
"Congarts on the Wifey bro" 🤣 😂 🤣

I was expecting kala chasma trend 😭☠️
Im not sure if it was accidental but the worse case scenario scene where the groom says rachel was amazing cause I immediately thought of the FRIENDS scene.
Only came here for Alexa Bliss

ALEXA BLISS YESSSS

Wait a minute, was "the worst case scenario" a Friends reference? If so, very nice 😂😂
How about church stereotypes 😊
Can we all agree they make the best videos   👇🏼
the reason why clip-on ties were invented
> The Rage Monster  Oh here we go boys, time to get rowdy-  > BRIDEZILLA HAS ENTERED THE CHAT  (Cue MORTAL COMBAT OST)
2:14 they had us in the first half
Who was the bridezilla? 🤣
Alexa Bliss & Dude Perfect is a collab we never saw coming, but will absolutely welcome! Some blessings are received unasked!
Alexa Bliss bustin some moves 😂😂
as a bowling fan, thanks for the "WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? I AM!"
Aint no one about to talk about the priest being married...
ALEXA BLISS <3 DAMN
Alexa bless 😂 your boy bray Wyatt is back !
no one noticed they had Alexa Bliss in here
So was that the real Alexa Bliss?
Bro do he actualy breaks them or it is editted?
6:48 We have a new contender, her name: BRIDEZILLA!
POV: You watch these stereotypes videos just to watch the “Rage Monster” scene. Lol 😂 If you relate 👇
THE FRIENDS REFRENCE
we have all seen the raw power of the rage monster . . . but it only took 1 video for it to be overpowered by the bridezilla.
We need school/ college stereotypes!!!
Keşke bide türkçe mealini koysaymissiniz
The wedding video was hilarious lol. Great Job Dudes👍
Pink tie looser😂😂😂
honey wake up, a new stereotype just dropped
Emily Rachel 😂😂
The rage monster never gets old😂
Anyone else see the friends reference on the worst case scenario one
was just waiting for dude perfect!!!
I think it's a bit creepy how DP wants to know who my friends are at the end of every single video
6:03 തല്ലുമാല കണ്ട നമ്മക്ക് ഇതൊക്കെയെന്ത്😏😹
''And the bride has entered the chat'' by best quote from dude perfect this year
Was that Alexa bliss? From WWE?
🥰😍
I want to know how much did you pay Alexa Bliss to be in your video
That Friends reference tho HAHAHAHA love it 🤣
Within 20 hours
a fight we where all hoping for bridezilla vs rage moster after 7 year's rage moster has been pinned
I hadn't expected 'Rage Monstress'
Cory and Coby always enjoy the Rage Monster Show
No one gonna talk about alexa bliss?
Great ❤❤
Just went to a wedding today. Dude...perfect timing
5:15 if it that was a Pete Weber reference Dude Perfect just earned my like on this video
Even the Peter Weber quote and Alexa Bliss truly a nice Video
This is absolutely the worst video you've ever made.

The rage monster said my birthday 🫢
🔥 Hlo guys I am a YouTuber  Me ek YouTuber hu❤ Meta blog ka Chennal hai

I’m TIE noob 😂😂
That "friends" reference was hilarious 🤣
I'm from Iraq, I hope you follow up
Nice friends reference
I’m suit struggles for sure! Had pants that were 6 inches too short one wedding 😂

Rang seen is the best

Nice nod to Pete Webber at 5:50

Watching Alexa Bliss in the video doing wrestling moves was really funny 😂
"Come after me, I'm a man, I'm 40" IM DYING I can't believe they found a way to put that in there, fav press conference ever
The guy that puts too much cologne on 😂😂😂😂😂
The tie guy is literally me
Why is the black guy the best at dancing 😏

I think all of us loves RAGE MONSTER right❤? Always the best
Ok Ik Im not the only one who saw Alexa bliss at 4:45
Nobody talking about the friends reference?
I guess we found out the one enemy that can take down the rage monster and that is bridezilla
cooking/food stereotypes
Dude perfect is turning into WWE and I love it.
Cool to see Alexa on the vid
Rage monster scenes is my favorite 🔥
Was that Alexa bliss
#1 Trending! Let’s go!!
Love how well they added the editors to the videos
Low key thought the girl was about to go rage monster about the wedding planner dissing her hair. xD  Edit: spoke too soon lol
Knot
Weird seeing a rage monster whers Cody wasn't the one for Tyler's rage. But that Bridezilla was a hilarious twist I didn't expect to immediately follow the rage monster!
Anybody else realized the Friends reference when he mixes up Emily's name for Rachel's??
Far out is there a zoom wedding option?
The WWE wedding
The rage monster and bridezilla part is completely ruined and rigged👿👿👿👿👿👿😡😡😡😡😡😡🤬😠🤬😠😠😈
I’m the bachelor, obviously
"We already mixed quesos" 🤣
This was released on the day of my dad's wedding!

Niubuybyb
Looks like Alexa had fun doing this video 😂😂

They said my birthday i must be famous
Surprisingly my mum and dad are going to my uncles wedding
I just went to a wedding yesterday….
Anyone else notice "Uncomfortable photoshoot" at 11:06, but not in the video?
You dude are away some😊😊 Lot's of love from India😊😊
8:47 is a 'Friends' (the tv series) reference, which is my favorite! <3
8:49 ross 🤣🤣🤣
This feels like a Youtube video straight out of 2010 but it is actually funny
worst one yet
I TAKE THEE RACHEL
all i came to say was...dp guys clean up NICE
The never ending veil got me so hard. 😂
#1 trending wow!!!!!!!
I think its funny that even after the bridezilla Alexa made it into the runaway bride to track down the girl who wore the white dress, also poor sparks, he got hit with a full on piece of wood
Bro was that Alexa Bliss😂😭
The friends reference when he called Emily Rachel. 😂
we have fe-ragemonster  (female ragemonster ) hahahah\
Dude perfects funniest video ever. I was on the verge of tears especially at the bad wedding video part and the run away bride.
He really committed on that faint
I DIED when sparky "farted bro" it was just so cleanly executed 😂😂
Continual laughter with this one.
Is that Alexa Bliss at 4:54?
The F.R.I.E.N.D.S reference 😊
at last we got someone to defeat the rage monster
Rage Monster woulda been better if it was a guy who got stood up at his own wedding
On this episode of death battle, who will win, the rage monster or the bridezilla, who do you think will win
Dude y’all got Alexa to do bridezilla? I’ve become that much more a fan of DP!
This was one of the most funniest stereotype videos. The worst case scenario one got me especially.
The rage monster is a tradition at this point
Girl rage monster was unexpected 😂
No comments about the Pete Weber reference? “WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE… I AM”
Evergreen rage monster 😅✌
so who's wedding did the rage monster ruin now
6:04 YOUR WELCOME :)
I love stereo type vids
The Rage Monster finally got bested
L
Ah yes the infamous rage monster, 7 years gold performance, and about uh, I forgot how many times he's been counter attacked, like the pool KO and the Taze and Bridezilla slam Dunking Ty. There are things you don't expect like a Rage OHKO.
Congarts on the new video bro!!!!
The6 should collab with culter 35😊
Hey you guys should do a virtual reality stereotype video that would be great
Ay  lets go new font
I love the friends reference
So many people are gonna miss the "wrong name" reference 🤣
The bridezilla wae unexpected
finnaly someone could stop the rage monster!
Dude perfect's feeble attempt to cross into acting comes to a head in their "stereotypes" series.  The team's trickshot fame has led them to believe they are talented in other areas. Instead of making videos people like, they have resorted to attempt to act and make videos that nobody ever asked for.  More on this story at 11.
This was one of the best sterotypes yet. Absolutely loved it
Theme Park Stereotypes next?
keep my wifes name out your mouth😂😂😂🫢
I sure hope that wasn’t a real Bible that got soaked
I'm jealous that Sparky got to pretend marry Alexa Bliss...😑😑😑
Best one yet! 😂😂😂
Here come BRIDEZILLA!!!! ROAR!!!!
My cousin just got married today lol! The same day this was uploaded hahahaha
In all seriousness, that is exactly how Sparky and his wife would exit.
My best friend is getting married in six days, so this video could not have been more perfectly timed!
"maybe we're not meant to be together..." "yeah, but we already mixed quesos"
that was the greatest analogy ever
Come after me im 40  Anyone else get it?
bridezilla is what is needed to get the rage monster under control.
Lexi took the spotlight
Best thing is we got WWE extreme rules there😅😅😂😂😂
as a wedding videographer, this was perfect.
“I’m a man! I’m 40!” Gem reference
So no one gonna talk about Sparky in a suit😏
Favs went to one yesterday
Finally someone worthy for the rage monster
Forgot the awkward guarder fetch/toss lol. I can see why it isn't in here though, great works fellas! Brought me back to my wedding 9 months ago, what a time!
The happy Gilmore quote at the end 👌 100/10.       😂😂😂
Who else would wants them to post a “school stereotypes”
Do road trip stereotypes
SCHOOL STEREOTYPES PLEASE!!!😂
DJ Double Vision 🔥🔥🔥 That show off tho🔥
ALEX BLISS VS RAGE MONSTER, WHAT A DREAM MATCH COME TRUE, ONLY HERE
throwback to f.r.i.e.n.d.s 😂😂
on my wedding. me and my wife left in a F/A 18 super hornet cause I am a Navy pilot, so I was granted permission to fly it without restrictions
I LOVE THE FRIENDS REFERENCE!!
The Prank Brothers Stereotype was the funniest part especially the snake. That part made me can’t stop laughing
I miss the old days
yall should do a fastfood
I see Alexa bliss there
😅
I saw this while at a wedding. 😂😂
Let play game who subscribe first channel he or she will be winner
8:49 F.R.I.E.N.D.S reference😂😂
Bradzilla can honestly ruin my wedding if she wants to
8:51 Pulled a Ross Geller from Friends. 😵😂😂
Sunday 9 october
This is the best stereotypes of all times. Alexa Bliss done her part so well. Everyone did an amazing job. ☺️☺️☺️
Dude perfect we are coming to visit dude perfect headquarters in frisco dallas
You forgot the dine and dasher
i just love stereyotypes man the bestttttttttt
Do each of your house tour in dp plus channel
At least someone knows how to tame the Rage Monster which is Alexa Bliss who's to be a pro wrestler herself & the result ended with Tyler getting slammed into the cake. 🤣🤣
the Will Smith and Mike Gundy lines😂😂
This lady ruined it
RAGE MONSTER 2.0
It really was an interesting and laughable video 😂  This made my day ❤️
The rage monster fight was like something out of kick and it
SuB oR I WiLl FiNd YOu
Was that Alexa Biss😂
Hey
Yo upload
At some point there is just too many different sets. Also the acting was a little cringe with the whole female rage monster. Other than that that were pretty funny. I really appreciate all the variety they have in each video never giving boring old content
Is it just me or does everyone love the rage monster the most? It’s always the funniest part of all the stereotype videos.
You guys nailed everything 💯👏  This is probably my favourite Rage skit of all.
Track and field stereotypes 😂😂😂
The chair "door got me rolling 🤣
Bucket list.
0:52 that was my parents wedding
ALEXA BLISS 🙌🙌🙌
Been saying it for years. SCHOOL STEREOTYPES
Y’all should do a mini golf stereotype’s!
Who else got the reference from F.R.I.E.N.D.S.
I would love to see train stereotypes
when i saw the girl(Alexa Bliss) i was like i recognize her and im guessing if its Alexa Bliss and looked at description and it is her lol
What if they kept doing more than one rage monster
rage monster and bridezilla was the best
Best Rage Monster EVER!!!! Seeing Tyler being stopped by Alexa Bliss is just epic. She was the first one (or I think it's the first one) to stop him. Loved this video!
should totally do youtuber stereotypes
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? I AM! - great Pete Weber reference
these new stereotypes always amaze me! love what you do keep it up
Ame la parte de Alexa Bliss 😂❤️💖
lol, is that Alexa Bliss?
Loved the Pete Weber reference! “Who do you think you are, I am!”
Awesome man! Just got back from a wedding 😅; this is so accurate!   I was the dj lol
Just got married last weekend, perfect timing
Extravagant exit is on point 😂😂
Number 1 on trending
6:47 what the heck just happened
I was at my mums wedding yesterday..... ALOT OF THESE ARE TRUE
Alexa Bliss...that was cool
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? I AM
The veil one got me to burst out laughing
Dude Perfect never disappoints us with their content ❤
Trying to figure out who the dude at 8:11 is? My wife and I can’t put our finger on where we know him from
Nothing beats the garder toss and my brothers wedding. A girl caught the Bouquet and her boyfriend who we all liked was in the crowd to catch the garder. We huddled up and all made a plan to get the garder to him. We full on Dove for this thing and slingshotted it around. It was hilarious. He got it and his gf was none the wiser. Now they’re engaged and getting married in February.
Garret lost the rings  ... How fitting
13 hours, 2.4 million views
The rage monster  should never be beat
To think that someone could rival the power of the rage monster is something simply beyond my comprehension
How were y’all able to get Alexa bliss on dude perfect
So nobody saw Alexa bliss….anyone.
5:45 best pdw reference 😆
The preacher: CALL SECURITY!! rage monster: your gonna need the freakin fbi
Love the Mike Gundy reference “I’m a man, I’m 40!”
Alexi ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Guys was that a real bible getting wet?
This video is very  Different
Yep that's  I'm girl Alexa  bliss
They blew up the Death Star!!!
More bridezilla and prank bros
behinf the scenes?
🤣💙
You should do martial arts stereotypes And when tie becomes the rage monster he should take down a pack of ninjas
Alexa looked so smol in the truck… 😂 Five Feet of Fury for sure…
I just had a wedding today😂
Alexa bliss🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
You should do school stereotypes 👍🏻
Bro, I would be the emotional guy.
I LOVE THESE VIDEOS   LETS GOOOO
Ok but the Pete Weber reference. Perfect.
I had to check multiple times if my eyes were okay....so this actually is Little Miss Bliss....so awesome
Who do you think you are I am😂
WTF #1 ON TRENDING?!?!?
The rainy wedding, more like every pnw wedding ever
The way that dude fell 😂
THAT WAS AMAZING!!!!!! I loved the bridezilla 🤣
knew someone will go for a table when i saw bliss ❤️
I didn’t expect bridezilla you should make it a thing like rage monster that was so funny
STOP NOT THE FRIENDS SCENE 🩻
They did it
One of the weirdest video by far
The wife that raged was the best part ever!!
4:42-7:36 for Alexa
Yay more stereotypes
tie one happened with me
My "Groom Cake" is for sure gonna be a giant Wii with Wii Sports
I don’t get how wedding stereotypes correlates with trickshots
This is amazing! I don’t know if anyone else noticed the Pete Weber line “who do you think you are I am” had me laughing so much 😂😂
😂
Everyone's talking about Alexa but all i remember is "Congarts on the wifey bro"
Yeah school Stereotypes
we need more prank brothers! i was dying from sheer laughter 😂 🤣
This entire video had me crying 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Other stereotypes I will like to see - school stereotypes - hotel stereotypes
Funny but true too 😀
lawful
plesase make shcool stereotypes
Imagine
Perfect video it reminds me of the old days
I really like the "CongARts on the wifey bro"
Rage monster vs. Bridezilla 😂😂
The bald man look like Alfred from Batman
Definitely i missed , the journey don't stop believing slow dance.
1:57 I like how the dance music faded perfectly with the stereotype music
Maybe this is only Asian thing, but i'm definitely the guy who "scouts every food before wedding start" so i can get first serving of my favorite food from the wedding
Alexa bliss 🤣🤣🤣
What about funeral stereotypes
I think the “come at me, I’m a man, I’m 40” joke went over a lot of peoples heads
When are you guys going to do football😭😭 done every sport except football I swear😭😭
dude perfect after making stereotypes for people who don’t even exist:
Fun fact:Salt is just angry sugar
MORE BRIDEZILLAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You should do plant stereotypes next
RAGE MONSTER GOT OWNED
Congarts on the video bro
They got wwe wrestler Alexa bliss what
6:50         WOMEN 😂
These are all the reasons I do not go to weddings. That and divorce rates are climbing so the odds are never in anybody's favor.
POV: your hear because you haven’t watched dude perfect in a while so your seeing how well they can do it
Wait what was that Alexa bliss?
“Come after me, I am a man, I am 40”. What a great reference 😂
I just went to a wedding and came home and saw this
hi
Rage monster should’ve been able to 1 tap bridezilka
The Mike Gundy jab. Come at me I'm a man I'm 40
Wow is this how Christian's wedding looks like 😅😅🎉
Waiting for 6:05
Bro no one realised that the “ worst case scenario stereotype “ was related to the scene from friends when Ross said “I,Ross,take the Rachel instead of “I,Ross, take the Emily 😅😅😅
Rage monster is getting more destructive
2:05 naughty
DO A SCHOOL STEREOTYPE!!!
5:42 Could not be more perfect
4th time (I think) asking for a mini trick shots video (mini basketball hoop, finger flick football, table hockey, etc.). *Not small, underwhelming trick shots, just normal trick shots but with tiny objects.   Please make this happen I think a lot of people would like this, including me!!!!!   For anyone else who wants this to happen: let DP know
That Pete Weber quote was flawless. Well done
Wanna know the funny thing I’m going to a wedding in two weeks in Georgia
You'll should do cooking stereotype
I’m working at a wedding literally right now. Perfect timing.
Hi
Not gonna lie. Bridezilla ruined the whole thing. We all no that no one can beat Tyler in rage mode
The will smith reference was amazing
It’s funny cause my moms wedding was yesterday
YOU GOT ALEXA BLISS TO STEREOTYPE??? AWESOMEEE
I don’t know why but is that Alexa Bliss??
You know, that weird analogy pastor was weirdly deep lol. It's hard to lift someone up, especially if they don't help themselves in the process, which can drag you down easily. To add, if you both put in the help to lift you up, it will be easier.
“Who do you think you are? I am” “I’m a man, I’m 40” 😂😂
Stereotypes just isn't the same without "The Old Guy"
5:45 love the Pete Weber reference there!
Great editing mr. Timbits_89
Did I missed it or you forgot to add uncomfortable photo shoot
2:05 not going to lie, they had us in the first half
“And the bride has entered the chat!” 😂
Rage Monster and Bridezilla were a match made in heaven
I think you should do a vacation stereotypes next
This fight scene is ICONIC 😂
i am jomama(iron man snap lol). This is fr the questions btw.
If y’all see this tell coach baca hello - lane mathis from pc🥺
Hotel Steryotypes
"Who do you think you are I am". Why is no one talking about this lol 5:40
Not to be that guy, but plz don’t use bridezilla in any of the other vids
FRIENDS JOKES YESSS
All of them were great!!
I was wondering why I haven’t seen this,cIt came out 12 hours ago
GET MOVINF OR IM GONNA STUFF THOSE FLOWERS IN YOUR MOUTH
"the gamer child" - plays his Nintendo at max volume
How ironic I was just at a wedding
How do you compile a list of wedding stereotypes but left off the “for those of you that don’t know me…” speech ?!
Congarts on the wifey bro 😂
Do football stereotypes
Poor Cory holding the door also let's go rage monster
I caught the bouquet and I was like 7
alas, the rage monster has been defeated
Absolutely love stereotypes!!
Please Post a school stereotype vid :)
That’s the greatest wedding 💒 you guys done. Well done dude perfect and happy wedding day and halloween 🎃👻.
You missed the one who preposes at a wedding
8:47 just watched this episode of Friends yesterday
you no whats funny my parents went to a wedding today
Bridezilla is the most badass rage monster the world has ever seen.
Love this series of DP 👍🇳🇿 was that Aliex Bliss from WWE ?
You should do hockey stereotypes
The very first non-tyler rage monster is a monumental video
Best rage monster ever
Show off is the best
THE MIKE GUNDY REFERENCE
The best rage monster ever
I just want to take this moment and say dang ty nice cut
This might have been your best one yet. So relatable. Lollll
Me walking into every dance circle at every wedding: I'm about to create an environment so hype...
The rage monster never gets old.
Hey who is the lady who played the runaway bride she didn’t look familiar
This was amazing 😂
I was thinking we need another stereotype videos❤️
I love these but I’m worried someone’s going to get seriously hurt one day
LOVE YOU LEXIIII
The wedding video got me cracked lol 😂😂😂
5:45. I forgot her name but I keep thinking she is Harley quin Edit:Ohhhh now I remember
What happened to dp I just got back from a 6 year coma
Rainy weather on a wedding usually means bad luck lol
Can we all appreciate the work they do for us and the editors thank yall so much
And the bride has entered the chat 😂💀
Alexia bliss wow
After the bouquet toss battle royal....  You needed the groom throwing the garter -- where NONE of the guys want it and they all actively get out of the airborne path as if it's a flying porcupine.  Except for that one guy that that comes running in from the side and makes a diving catch as if it's a Hail Mary pass at the end of the Super Bowl.  (and he's oblivious to the fact that none of the other guys wanted it.)
the best rage monster everyyyyyy
WWEs alexa bliss.  Cool
6:03 6:49 7:10 LESSSSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOO😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈
I do not approve of this new font
For a minute I started thinking maybe someone in the staff was getting married
That was especially when Alexa bliss hit the hip toss on the cake
U forgot the child pageboy not wanting to hold hands with a girl 😂
Best Rage Monster/Bridezilla ever! 😂
pete weber... who do you think you are i am.... lets go
The best part of this video is the DP editors making the horribly-edited wedding video
I only watch the stereotype videos now since the trick shots and a lot more stuff is probably fake 😢
So I go on a plane and then there is plane stereotypes and I go to a wedding and then there is wedding stereotypes...
they ruined rage monster with bridezilla.
LOVE THE FRIENDS REFERENCE
Why is ty in a suit
Channel that is slowly dying
The rage monster's gonna cause total destruction
Ayo the most awesome stereotype video made!! Skiing is still my favorite. Loved the jokes, loved the Friends reference
Huish mantap🔥🔥
Did anyone notice at 8:52 that was a friend’s reference?
Best rage monster I've ever scene. well done.
Awesome vid! Always love when a new one comes out. Great job Dude Perfect!
What about school stereotypes?
Living in Arizona, I've attended and been part of quite a few scorchers. Outdoors in June or July at 2pm. It's like the couple just got here and have never heard of desert summer weather
yes another stereoteype
Friends reference? So cool. The problem with this video is that it ends. Loved Bridezila
This came at a perfect time. I get married next week
I loved the Mike Gundy reference
As a wedding video editor, I totally felt that part about the wedding video being so awful. I get terrible footage sometimes and there is nothing I can do about it.  Absolutely hilarious!
My cousin got married at that venue
I will literally do anything to work for you guys.
I was a part of a wedding today so this was aptly timed
I'd hire  double vision dj's haha
Are you serious are neow bro
Who do you think you are, I am.   A true classic
I could not think of a better person to play the rage monster.
Is this dude perfect or dude comedy? Wtf 😒
Loved that Friends reference!
Bro the curves
Want a vid
The rage monster got me🤣🤣🤣
Why is Alexa bliss in this 🤣🤣🤣
How did you get Alexa Bliss to do this video?
Alexa bliss is so random
As of now, on October 8, 2022, this is #1 trending
The last bit of crying from Ryan sounded like a turkey gobling!😂
Someone took down the rage monster.

Hahha this was great🤣🤣
Alexa Bliss
I am amazed they got Alexa Bliss
I’m using the best man speech lines for my sisters wedding in a week.
Best video. And with Alexa Bliss!!!!!
How about that commitment from the fainter guy to take that fall to the ground
🫣
Is that Alexa Bliss?
Haha😂😂
The dance circle is so true
Love the friends reference
Ah yes I went to a scorcher and I wanted to scream so loud afterwards to the bride. "I was alone in all that humidity for all that time you think I was totally fine?"
5:45 anyone who watches PBA bowling knows where this phrase came from
Alexa bliss cameo ?!🤯❤️
As always, Rage Monster's gonna be a demon lord again🤣🤣🤣 And btw that scorching wedding part makes me uncomfortable🤣🤣🤣
Amazing!
“Who do you think you are?? I am!” Such a classic deep cut
Loved the coach Gundy reference
THE FRIENDS REFERENCE WAS GOLD
Hello greetings 0:05 hahaha.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I laughed so hard thanks dude perfect.
I love how the bride was wearing normal shoes and not heels.
anyone else recognise the f.r.i.e.n.d.s. refrence
Who's early?
Do sleep over stereotypes
Glad to finally be early to one of these masterpieces
Where’s Ned?!

Rage Monster and Bridezilla got me laughing.

The Pete Weber Reference is the best part ifykyk 😂
Bro the Friends reference
love from Bangladesh
july 18th at 3:30 pm is the exact time and a day I was born... wild.
Ofc this video was posted on what would have been one year with her :(
#7:12 godzila vs king kong
Way to clean it up. Kinda jumped back last video. But hey, failure is a part of learning. I’m not going to watch this one but I just wanted to say I understand why you felt the need to change the tone. Complete 180
BRIDEZILLA IS SCARIER THEN RAGE MONSTER
Who do you think you are I am!
Alexa bliss bruh 😂😭
yooo july 18th thants my birtday!!!  thats sick
Female rage monster Nothing gets better than that
my brothers wedding in november , here we go
Idk who my friends would be or me, thought kids watched this🤣🤣
I don’t think they gave credit to mike gundy for using his quote
So nobody gonna comment about the Friends reference? I take thee Rachel is the best part beside bridezilla of course
THE BRIDE HAS ENTERD THE CHAT LOVE IT
The "Ty" heard round the world...
This is hilarious and I love it
I was not expecting Alexa bliss in this
Is that alexa bliss? Haha
6:56 "and the bride has entered the chat" sent me
The Pete Weber quote!! YEESSSSSS
Alexa Bliss flipping the rage monster was the best 😂
Uh oh a new rage monster
Pretty surprising that they added Alexa Bliss into this but it was a nice surprise
Did The purple Hoser lean into baldness?
1:50 did they hired this guy for the video or something 😂
#1 on trending rn
Yes we get one of the wives as a Rage Monster!! Bridezilla, perfect! We need the BTS and B-roll.
“The bride has entered the chat!” 😂
Ok. When is baseball stereotypes?!? Btw my last name is Toney too! My dads name is Jeff Toney like your dad Tyler!
You should do School stereotypes!!!!!!!! 🎒🏫😃
I think the only one you missed was The Skipped Wedding AKA, my parents who got married in my grandmas living room in front of the Christmas tree with 10 family members. And only that because my grandma forced them to do something! 😆
Tyler (the rage monster): GIVE ME THE FLOWER. YOU ARE SO SLOW!!🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣 6:05
Lol, perfect timing on this video. It's my dad's wedding today. We have the farmer stereotype. Had the wedding party walk out of a trailer with beers in their hands down the isle. Got kegs in the shop for later
I saw the 11 minutes and knew this one was gonna be a banger
This is perfect timing! My cousin is getting married two days after Thanksgiving, or two days before...
nobody gonna mention alexa bliss
She needs some anger management class
“Who do you think you are!? I AM”   Legendary quote
Is there anytime soon anybody else is gonna be rage monster
?
I can't believe that just happened. - me before watching the video
Alexa Bliss
Shoutout to Alexa bliss for her to being in the video :) Alexa being the runaway bride hahaha
😂
Is that Alexa bliss over there?
Ahhhh alexaaa
So weird how they uploaded this while I'm at a wedding.
The continuity in the story of this video is unlike any of the previous stereotype videos. Unreal
I feel like if its one of my close friend group i would be the first one
Surprising my first time going to Texas and we drove right by the Dude Perfect head quarters it was sick and crazy for me and my family because we like grew up off of these legends😮❤
😃😍🥰🤩😁♥️
My fav type of DP videos, Stereotypes!
ik u think we didnt notice, but why u change the font
like the twists and new sterotypes
Best stereotype video by far!! love it!
Bridezilla has got to be my favorite. It's nice to see something that can take down even the Rage Monster
Where can I book DJ Double Vision for my wedding?
So happy about seeing a female rage monster, aka bridezilla
Is that Alexa bliss
You guys should do dad stereotypes.
Oh they finally uploaded another video
Hands down the best one I have ever seen I've been dying of laughter the whole time
Stereotypes never.gets.old!!!! You guys nailed it. ☺️
Was that Alexa bliss
idea!!!! you should do a hotel stereotype it would be fun!!!!!!
The Friends reference, really???!🤯
Wedding Smackdown
That bridezilla/runaway bride sequence was incredible. Had no idea who she was until I scrolled down and checked the comments. No wonder she was so amazing!
Now That’s is the Rage Monster Cool.
I’ll never forgive the YouTube ad that came on with the rage monster que
I was at a wedding TODAY 💀
Did NOT expect to see Alexa Bliss in this but talk about perfect casting!
They should've added "The too crowded to see the bride and groom".
My favorite part of this video is when the rage monster makes an appearance I thought that was cool
'"It's just misting, it's really not even pouring." 2 seconds later... THUNDER!!
The rage monster and brizezilla is like hulk and she hulk lol 😂
Haha quoting friends
Amazing video also like the fact you got alexa bliss to join you for this video and also hope for some behind the scenes
So I have this movie or tv series that I can’t exactly remember and it’s giving me headache. So there’s this kid who tried to defend his mother from his abusing stepfather but he gets his nose broken. Then his mother prefers to spend the night sleeping with the abusive stepfather than to treat her injured son. If anyone knows the name please let me know
You guys should do a moving into a house stereotype
Respect from Algéria 🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🇩🇿🇩🇿❤️🇩🇿
*Moving Stereotypes!* 👇
the fight scene was so funny lol especially 6:26
Perfect rage monster
The only reason I watched this was because I saw Alexa Bliss on the thumbnail
i appreciate the pete weber reference 5:45
Loving the hair Ty
Loved the stereotype until the bridezilla way to ruin it
Who do you think you are I am was legendary
Alexa Bliss Is that you?
Dawg I literally just went to a wedding two weeks ago that was at that venue... what the frick hahah
I was a side better at a few weddings
I haven’t watched these guys in years. What a vid
Love it. It got me when they said those curves!😂😂
Wow how did you guys get alexa bliss to be in the video? Aside from that this was A+ stereotype video
THERES 2 RAGE MONSTERS! I WANT MORE

At 8:46, am I the only one who knew this was a reference to "Friends". Gotta love it!

DP be rubbing salt in the wound of a failed lovelife
Bro wait Alexa bliss what the how do u guys do this
Why did the dance show off have to be black and the Asian wedding guest have to do martial arts?!?
Let’s do college football stereotypes!!!
That Will Smith reference was 😂 well played. 5:42
Is it just me or did the long winded pastor make me rethink my life
The Pete Webber and Mike Gundy references had me rolling 🤣
A new challanger approaches
Love the fact that they are still best friends doing YouTube challenges after all these years 😊
7:16 I did a show in high school where someone did that to me (on script) except I went face first
THIS WAS AMAZING!!!
I've never seen a more destructive rage in my life, and the fact that coby said dream wedding 😆🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You’re legends!
You had me at CTC.
Bridzilla was Alexa Bliss right
BRDEZILLA I LIKE
Man I thought the bridezilla and the rage monster would end up getting married in the end and then every new stereotype video both of them would destroy everything
I find this funny I just came back from a wedding
The Pete Webber reference “who do you think you are” made me laugh so hard. As a bowler, I appreciated that😂
They got Alexa Bliss???
Forgot the roast speech!!!
ain't no way they got an mi-8 to airlift them...wtf
This is Top Notch Content ! hahaha
I’m the show off no I won’t stop no I’m not sorry 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Bridezilla and Rage Monster. The Ultimate Angry Duo.
Glad I haven't ever come across the prank brothers at a wedding!!
The prank brothers are the best
Please tell me that you didn’t destroy a bible just for a video
The friends reference was epic😂😂
I really don’t want to know how expensive that wedding cake was 😅
I LOVE RAGE MONSTER
Bridezilla 😍❤️
How to tie a tie with Ty. Perfect
I love that they took the worst case scenario from friends
These are the best.  🤣
The twins rallying with the rage monster 😂😂😂
2:13 VERY SUS
Rage monster got humbled!!!! 😱
8:49 friends reference ifykyk
Girl power go bridezilla!
Love the FRIENDS referrence
Never in my life did I ever think there’d be a female rage monster
School stereotypes   The gum chewer The kid who arrives an hour early The kid who has to 'go to the restroom' every ten minutes The cheater The talkative teacher The rich kid The bully The nerd The rage monster (the teacher told Ty he failed a test) The note sender Mr. Excuses The borrower The know-it-all The soda guy The guy who's sweaty from recess
i clicked only because i wanted to see the rage monster also the wedding video got me cracking XD
It scares me how much Alexa can lift
Honey, wake up. Dude Perfect posted.
This is awesome guys! Top-tier quality as always! Also, congrats on being #1 on trending! Keep it up!
Y'alls videos are the best always but these Stereotypes are by far the best EVER! 🤣😂🤣🙌🙌
Dude Perfect should start making sequels to previous stereotype videos
0:56 the water spit sent me rolling
I love your videos and love how you add faith to your videos! Great Stereotypes!
I'm dying over here 🤣. I looked up one of those how to tie a tie videos a week ago for a wedding
4:54 is that lexi kaufman AKA alexa bliss from WWE?
Still waiting for my drive-thru and school stereotypes
I love the rage monster!! It's so funny 😂
i know you guys arent jewish, but you should do a barmitzfah stereotypes video
Love the FRIENDS joke
As a former DJ, y'all nailed this one! Between weddings I ran to weddings I've attended, I can personally attest to every scenario but the ''Objection''.
this has to be their best stereotype video yet. loved the bridezilla bit
The Rage Monster is out of his throne due to the superior Bride.
anyway u can post the tie a tie with ty
I LOVE THESE🎉❤!!!
6:57 and the bride has entered the chat 😂😂😂😂😂
I love the use of the “come after me, I’m a man, I’m 40!” Reference
Alexa bliss
Rage Monster bits then: "Lol what if we popped a car's tires and shot it with paintball guns haha"  Rage Monster bits now: *Hundreds of dollars spent, movie-level fight choreography, and a celebrity cameo*
Can you guys do "puplic transport" steoriotypes
Forgot "the Corsage Fumbler" (sister to the Tie Noob) 3:00 the snake prank was awesome (brothers with cowboy hats what I always had in my mind)  Also loved the "Intense Wedding Planner" it's the look I always thought it would be.  And the Ragezillaway-WWE-livestream selfie montage was one of the best inclusions with Alexa Bliss rockin a monster truck blasting through a gazebo then going all Charlize Theron.  -  * laughing at my own discovery years ago of my inability to pin corsages at my brothers wedding in Texas. But excelled at keeping the wife's brother from loosing the ring and jumping in the pool. I was definitely opposite from "the Best Man Speech" and more like "the Awkward Speech" ha ha.
6:27 everyone talking about Alexa Bliss but this Jackie Chan fight was just amazing
Alexa bliss slamming people ngl 😂
Im the best man and my mate is the groom
Who do you think you are??   **I AM!!!**
Alexa Bliss ❤
What was the very last part about?  I must have missed something.  "So I said to Keith...I don't want just one, I want the whole thing."  I get that he is the long winded one, but is there any significance to the lines?
The rage monster has met his match…
There’s TWO rage monsters?!
Bridezilla wow
I saw that Mike Gundy quote
wait a second... dj double vision is actually genius
Sleep over stereotypes
I think Dude Perfect should be in the movies
The Rage Monster is always the best 😡 😤
Full 11min of this, amazing.
bridezilla chick is really pretty
was that Alexa Bliss?
ALEXA BLISS!
Thanksgiving Stereotypes  Hotel Stereotypes  Docter Stereotypes  Library Stereotypes  Dentist Stereotypes  Movie Night Stereotypes  Drive Thru Stereotypes  New Years Party Stereotypes   Those ones are just suggestions!   Thanks DP For This Awesome Video!
Bidezilla ain’t it g
WOAH
WOAH
Peep the Pete webber quote at 5:45 that was so flawless
This is the best stereotype yet
What a fun video!

Tyler's rage monster ends in 1 Million years
Literally getting married next week. This dropped at a perfect time
Ahhhhhhhh
I love the Friends reference of Ross say Rachel’s name instead of Emily’s
Bridezilla > Rage Monster
Imagine if The Rage Monster and Bridezilla fall in love.
Who else loved Bridezilla
Since they are Christian’s they should do church stereotypes
1 on trending!?!
It took me a minute to realize that was alexa bliss! I knew I saw her somewhere 😂
Awesome to see Alexa Bliss.
I think these dudes have been watching a little too much WWE as of recent.
This my favourite Stereotypes video
:)
my sister was married yesterday this is perfect
Tyler did you rage for no reason?
I'm so happy there's a new stereotypes video I've been waiting for a new one
but they mixed QUESOS
6:50 another rage monster
Was that Alexa bliss?
Anyone who found a friends reference like this comment
no the story of jael 🤣🤣🤣🤣
W
These stereotypes get better and better.
NUMBER 1 ON TRENDING 😱😱😱😍😍😍
I'm the tie guy 😅😂😂
Great video, but your forgot to include the mother and father stereotypes of weddings.
Come after me, I’m a man I’m 40 😭😭
Wait sparky was with like 5 different girls this video  W rizz
I love that Alexa Bliss is in the video! You can totally tell that she was a wrestler, the way she threw the guys into the table lol!  You should do student stereotypes next!
Am I the only one a bit sad bout the font change
that escalated quickly...
"but we already mixed the quesos" 😂😂😂 Great to see Alexa Bliss, she killed it
Bro I remember asking for them to do wedding stereotypes back when I was in middle school
the iternet is cess pool... only guy having fun is sewer guy
This channel is the foundation of my childhood
Tim looked so weird without his hat on
disappointed
Love the Friends Refrence! 8:45
We all love these series
You should totally do corn maze stereotypes
1 rage monster is cool but two rage monster is insane
The rage monster never disappoints
The rage monster felt like an action movie
Wow Cody with a speaking role! Respect!
YESSSSSSSS
Can I recommend one stereotype/bowling
ayy finally a new streotype next do school stereotypes
you should do dog park stereotypes
I laughed so much during this! You guys are hilarious. I really wanted to see the scenario where the mother-in-law wears a white dress or worse yet, a wedding dress. (I think I've spent too much time on Reddit).
This is probably one of my favorite stereotype videos from Dude Perfect. Hilarious video!
My cheeks hurt from smiling so hard
For me I don’t really like it. Being 16 I’m not totally into this. The only part is the rage monster
No way this happened today, I just came back from a wedding, what a coincidence. This is also hilarious
The fact that they did the Emily-Rachel thing from Friends 😂
I love 6:23 lol
Bro Ty just made my day. The Pete Weber quote was phenomenal. “Who do you are, I am.” Ima bowler and I am happy now.
No video has made me laugh as much as Dude perfect ones. They go all out on every video. Mad respect for all the coreography and writing behind the scenes.
There needed to be one Sister Abigail from Alexa Bliss
1:08 What Bible verse was Ty reading?
I’m so mad bridezilla won over rage monster):
Is that WWE Superstar Alexa Bliss I see in there?
I want to get married in Paris France by the Eiffel Tower Loved this video
My favorite stereotype in this video is the dance circle and the show off
Da best.
This was your Bestvideo yet
Was the bridezilla Alexa Bliss
Awesome video!!!
5:43 Any one else felt this could have been a perfect will smith slap moment?
The  reference to Ross from Friends saying the wrong name was fantastic!
Has anyone really been a part of an objection before? Cmon now lol
THAT FRIENDS REFERENCE u guys just made one of your best vids even better🔥💪
Loved to see little miss bliss with you guys♥️
July 18th? That’s my birthday 😂
Lol dropped the Mike Gundy quote in there nice!
That was amazing ❤🎉😅
lol
1:13 - You misspelled "perfectly" on the caption. :)
Hey guy’s. How are you guy’s  doing today?. I Really liked your Wedding Stereotypes video. Especially the Rage Monster and BrideZilla.
My fave was Bridezilla 😂
Bridezilla looked like Alexa Bliss
rage monster!!!!! rip wedding
Literally going to a wedding tomorrow lol
Alexa Bliss 🙄 really
“Bridezilla has entered the chat” 😂
Can you do Need For Speed Stereotypes, Bluray Stereotypes, School Stereotypes and Cooking Stereotypes?
8 HOURS AGO!
"i marry you, RACHEL" 🤔  Friends scene?😂
The bridezilla the only one to ever stop the rage monster.
none 'cause i'll never have this, but looks fun
*The return of the king*
School stereotypes. Tyler should do the rage monster because he got an F on his test?
The rage monsters weakness
6:49 FEMALE RAGE MONSTER!
I have an interesting idea for a stereotype video, Convention
I was privileged to be in a wedding without any of these stereotypes
Nice friends reference
*Congarts on the wifey bro*
Alexa bliss
Very cool stereotypes video. Loved the “Never Ending Veil”, that was very funny.
Seems like dude perfect was crying about when they missed out for their friends at least 😭
The Will Smith and Mike Gundy references were on point😂
“Who do you think you are, I am” - Some bowling guy
alexa from wwe🔥
1:57
As someone who just had a wedding this is perfectly right
Where’s the people that only go for the food 😂
We went from him destroying property to destroying ppl in fights, he’s indestructible
I loved the friends reference
FINALLY ANOTHER RAGE MONSTER
Friends moment.
the rage monster(s) in this video were crazy
1 ON TRENDING
I've been waiting for this!!!!
The timing of this video is perfect, my brother is having a wedding tomorrow
bridezilla a bit cringe some things should only be done by males
Now I just want pastor/church stereotypes
The friends reference 😂
# bring back the old stereotypes font
The guy who doesn’t want to be there but has no choice   That’s me 😢😂
Why does the Bridezilla look like Alexa Bliss from WWE
This must have cost so much to make, fitting I suppose given how expensive weddings can be
The blonde with pink in her hair looks like Alexa Bliss.
I loved the Friends Reference ahahahahha
The best rage monster I've ever seen XD
Always the rage monster
That background music combined with Bridezilla and the Rage Monster makes this the best Stereotypes video yet.
Alexa Bliss, that's a Dude Perfect W!
I like yur cut T
i wonder how many people understood the "who do you think you are? I am!" reference 😂😂 PDW😂😂😂
I am the tie noob.
Comment down below: which do you think is better: Bridezilla or The Rage Monster?
You’d should do football stereotypes
I love the up in production budget and bringing in stunt people
6:15 gta mission cutscene be like
They have still got it.
Sheehs

I love the “Come after me I’m a man, I’m 40”

Next up library stereotypes
This is No. 1 on trending!!!!!!!!
the first bride looked like Alexa Bliss
SMASH the LIKE 👍 BUTTON if you have ever PASSED OUT or seen SOMEONES PASS OUT during a wedding before.
6:04 RAGE MONSTER
5:11 Using a dictionary instead of a Bible 🤓
I tried to catch some fog.      But I mist.
Imagine if they get John Cena for a collaboration next. What a video that would be. Imagine if they make a Wrestling Stereotypes video, and Cena collabs in that one.
I just happen to be rewatching these lately
Wait was that Alexa Bliss from WWE or that just kinda looks like her
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?? I AM😭
The endless veil one had me laughing so hard; man how true that is....
Ironically I’m getting married tomorrow 😂😂😂
Was that Elexa bliss😮😂😂❤
Actually, that thing about pulling someone down was pretty deep!
alexa bliss was amazing
Funny cause I’m going to a wedding 😂😂😂
4:40 was that Alexa Bliss?
Lol
The best man at my wedding put the groom’s ring in his pocket. He also put his own wedding band in his pocket… and they were identical bands in the same size… They double checked later to look at the dents in his brother’s ring to make sure they had their own. 🙄
coby and cory were on point in this one
The rage monster part was amazing
Yesssss
Am I the only one who saw that was Alexa bliss
The friends quote tho
I demand a fully fledged smackdown between Rage Monster and Bridezilla! 🤣🤣🤣
I think Ty might of got his rage monster tooken away from Alexa Bliss
is that alexa bliss
The best man smotional speech was just on point!!
Do school stereotypes!!!!
This was a great video not just because Alexa Bliss was in it, well mainly that Alexa Bliss was in this. I wasn’t expecting her to drive a monster truck and act like the female rage monster.
great to see Alexa Bliss here. Awesome guest
It’s Alexa bliss
Is it me or was that Alexa bliss from wwe
Completely ruined it with bridezilla
Love the Mike gundy reference 😂😂😂
PINK TIE LOSER
The friends reference 2gooooodd

If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart the Father raised Him from the dead you will be saved. Romans 10:9

Bridezilla was amazing 😂 just gotta edit in Duel of the Fates aaaaand…. Perfection.
We are going to beat you too it, but... ZOO STEREOTYPES! CMON ITS RIGHT THERE
Alexa bliss part was funny 🤣
Is it just me or the guy in the begiining when he starts crying he sounds like pops from regular show
Once I saw Alexa Bliss, I knew what was going to go down.
Friends reference?
Friends referenced
Was that alaxa bliss
Love the friends reference 8:48
6:00-7:34 man i hate when that happens lol
Alexa bliss,❤️
How did you get Alexa Bliss to join the video?
Do you school stereotypes next
The reference from the friends series got me 😂
I love the friends quit
Bridezilla vs rage monster should be a thing
How’d they get Alexa bliss here
I love Dude perfect!  Favorite dudes are the twins especially Cory!!  Rage monster is the best though from Ty. 😡😂
06:30 is awesome
It was cool Alexa Bliss was in this a little bit
The bride has entered the chat had me laughing so hard
Since I legitimately don't know how weddings go, due to me never being married, I'm glad this video now exists.
Nah bro this fr epic
Man the “ Bridzilla “ part came out of the blue
My brother: “Alright, rage monster rating this time?” Me: “Dunno, haven’t finished that part yet.” After watching it. Me: “Ten, ten, absolute ten.” My brother: “Absolutely ten, yup.”
You need to do a steorotypes video putting all of the kinds of people together, like rage monster, prank bros, old guy, etc.
A part 2 of this would be awesome. Also love this vid. Laughed just about the whole time
Wassupppppp
Rage Monster VS Bridezilla?
Bridezilla looks luke Margo Robbie… she single by any chance?
Yall need to to do home stereotypes
Bro when it showed “ the rage monster “ tag a add appeared I knew after the add destruction was gonna happen it was spooky 😱
Thanks for the great video
6:29 Idiot!
I was watching this and as soon as the rage monster name tag came on an advert hit
Tyler what happened to the font mann
“Come after me, I’m a man, I’m 40” it’s a reference from a coach who didn’t like people disrespecting players on his football team.
Never ending Veil More like the Rapunzel
Lol
Pin pls
I love the rage monster...
Atleast Nun If You Guys Are Cheating
Did uncomfortable photshoot not make the cut? Because it says it at the end but I couldn’t find the clip in the video
What about the couple that had a little too much apple juice?
I love this 😆😆
why do people watch this
July 18th is my wedding anniversary😂 but my wedding was indoors
The suit ones were relatable
Who that Alexa bliss from wwe
Double rage monster wetting
Bro the BRIDEZILLA is the funniest thing I ever in a long time I was laughing to death
Bro thas what Jackie Chan be doin with the chair block move😂
You should have added “Wedding proposers” for those annoying people who propose AT WEDDINGS
“For those of you who don’t know me…”
Brizilla what the heck girl rage monster
1.4M Views in 7 hours. Me: Impressive
the Death Star references were quite fire😂
Largely a disappointment. Cody, the twins, Garrett, and Tyler were not in it enough, Sparky was in it too much, the Prank Brothers were Tyler and Sparky, not Cody and Cory, the Rage Monster was disappointing, and it was cringy besides when it was just you five and a couple other stereotypes.
I love the “friends” reference in here
9:24This had me laughing for like 5 minutes straight🤣😂
Who else is waiting for school stereotypes?
My Favorite Character, Eyeball
I like the friends tribute
alexa bliss?
My daughter was married outside in July in 90+ degree weather.We had to move the chairs over to one side to get a little bit of shade. The alum chairs were on fire.We heard that day the people married in churches fainted and had cakes collapse.
After all these years the rage monster has been defeated
Excellent Pete Weber reference lol
This is one of the best stereotypes I have ever seen 😂
Bridezilla killed it😂😂😂
You guys should make a school stereotypes!
bridezilla was awesome
I’m sorry but the Groom’s Cake one was so funny 😂
Always for rage monster
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE. I AM. what a quote 😆
DID WE JUST FIND THE NEW RAGE MONSTER?!?!?!
I think we can all agree with the rage monster on this one
The wedding planner😭😂😭😂
Why the New fond though
This coming out 2 hours after a wedding for my aunt is so convenient
It’s been 7 years and they still make the best vids on the internet
Hands down my favorite stereotype video to date! 😀👏
“Come after me I’m 40!”    If you know you know
I feel bad for the dude dealing with Garret the whole wedding😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭
Bruh I was at the part where he was yelling as rage monster and I got an ad for the Calm app where it helps you fall asleep 💀
Wasn’t that car towed
3:55 Pops😭😂
8:52 NEW MISSION PEOPLE: SEND THIS TO EITHER JENNIFER ANISTON OR DAVID SCHWIMMER
BRO WHERE DID ALEXA BLISS COME FROM
ALEXA
I alr knew it will happen 🤣
Bro, the 'congarts on the wifey bro' had me dying 🤣🤣
I’ve watched dude perfect for so long and this is probably one of my favorite stereotypes 😂.  But let’s be honest no one can beat rage monster
Who's the new guy.?closed the video coz of him
BRIDEZILLA
love these videos
1:55 Panda IS THE DJ😮😮😮😮
Plot twist.   Dude perfect crew simply  volunteered to be the videographers for Sparky's wedding. The rest was luck.
Wow, Alexa Bliss! I was wondering why she looked so familiar.
let's go bridezilla🤣😂
"I John.. take you Racheal" ..They really did that huh 😂
1:45, that is not really my thing, then turns into a beast😱
The Rage Monster is and always will be my favorite
Even though the rage monster is always in the middle of the video. You always forget to anticipate it 2 mins before.
I will also be registering for my wedding at academy outdoor
congarts on this great video bro
THE FRIENDS EASTER EGG AHAHAHAHHAA
Let's be honest, like this if you came to see Alexa Bliss
The rage monster and bridezilla are a match made in heaven!
For once, it looks like Cody did not trigger the rage monster.
RAGE MONSTERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR         istg that never gets old
oh yes alexa bliss 5 feet of fury on dp stereotypes
Rage monster vs Bridezilla, that was hilarious!   Awesome stereotype video, can’t wait for the next stereotype video and the next video!! 👍 keep it up!
Sorry I’m a wrestling nerd  Was that WWE Star Alexa bliss aka Lexi Kauffman (idk her new wedding name)
The prank brothers made me laugh 🤣😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
plz do college stereotypes 😭😭😭
Alexa Bliss should change her name to Bridezilla
Little bit of WWE action at that wedding.
alexa killed it XD
You forgot the crazy batchelor party.
THEY ADDED A FRIENDS REFERENCE 🤣🤣
Tyler still gets it with the rage mode, I just love it year after year
Loved the friends reference
Alexa bliss?
I've have emotional breakdown at my younger brothers' weddings this year😭😭😭😭
Come after me! I’m a man! I’m 40! Best part by far
“Man this is an underwhelming rage monster”  *BrideZilla enters*

Why Garret look like Walter White
Rain on your wedding day does mean luck in your future
That rage monster vs bridezilla fight
Rage monster vs bridezilla, who would win that?

2 saniyede ortalığın *n*s*n* s*kt*ler

Here's one they didn't include that I think is present at weddings: The guest that's just there for the FOOD
I missed the stereotypes I am so happy they are back I already watched all the other stereotypes lol
plz do school stereotypes and sleep over stereotypes great vids BTW
You forgot the Wedding Proposer. Those who choose to propose on someone else’s wedding day!
Could you guys do Bubble Gum Stereotypes?
Is that Alexa bliss
For your next video you should do gender reveal stereotypes
Alexa bliss was a grt surprise
The tie one was so accurate
Best rage monster of all time
Well that was a rage-full weeding 😅😅
Is that alexa bliss???
MY BIRTHDAY IS JULY 18THHHHH!!!!
I love this stereotype.
I was so expecting bridezilla and rage monster ro end up together as some weird change of emotions but I think the monster truck was a better way to take it
How did Alexa Bliss get in the video?
I loved the Jackie Chan reference and Bridezilla.
I like that with the Mike Gundy reference
I love the friends reference
Alexa Bliss 🔥
When I was a young boy about 5 years old, my uncle chose me to be the ring boy for at his wedding. My job was to carry the rings on a pillow down to him and his partner. I still remember getting lessons for how to correctly hold the pillow, walk down the isle while holding the pillow, and wearing a nice little suit. That day was a nice day.
Alexa bliss from WWE :0 was not expecting that
i love it yeeeeeeeeeeeees❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Didnt that girl who was raging look like Alexa bliss
Quite boring and I still can't forget "Bucket List : Qatar World Cup 2022" 👎
Bvcgyhmi,omjjoomk(,l(hi bghfvc&fv
The collab of bridezilla and the rage monster was genius.
I can't believe they got a wwe wrestler in a video
School stereotypes next please
Yo when did dude perfect get Alexa bliss on Dude perfect, she is my favourite wrestler on WWE on the woman’s roster, my favourite for the mens is the tribal chief Roman REIGNS☝️
These stereotypes really never fails us
The monster truck scene was amazing.
Do a school stereotypes. Like so Dude Perfect can see this comment.
Disappointing wedding video, Bridezilla, and rage monster were the best.
Funeral stereotypes
Is bridzilla Alexa Bliss from WWE???
they forgot the courthouse wedding
I'm here only for *Rage monster* 😁
Disappointing wedding video made me laugh so hard that I couldn't breath
Alexa Bliss was amazing
Judges 4 : 21 NKJV "21 But Jael, Heber’s wife, picked up a tent peg and a hammer and went quietly to him while he lay fast asleep, exhausted. She drove the peg through his temple into the ground, and he died."
5:25 exactly how i want my wedding to go down
The rage monster met his match
I would love to see Bridezilla vs The Rage Monster pt.2
FRIENDS REFERENCE
The long winded pastor is always frustrating😂
My cousins wedding is literally today
Love Alexa Bliss if anyone can take down the Rage Monster it's her
BROOO ITS A NEW ONEEE?!?! PRAISE THE LORDD
Why did we change the font though. The OG graphics were the best.
hi
where is the greek wedding???
Alexa Bliss = The Rage Woman Monster
I know Bliss when I see her
Alexa Bliss. I love it
Super cool that you guys got Alexa Bliss to join you for this video! Also, it might be a long shot, but “How to tie a tie with Ty” should be a regular series!
Do 8ball pool stereotypes
Not gonna lie, that Helicopter exit sounds like something I’d want to do!!
This is honestly the best stereotypes video ever made by DP. The little things like the friends reference are so well executed and I could watch this over and over again and still laugh!
I've been to Vietnam for the wedding day in 6 years later
now that you’ve done wedding stereotypes, do funeral stereotypes
The way Derek ran out the door.
nothing could beat cody and cory as the prank brothers
YALL GOT ALEXA!!
It's I ROSS take you Rachel- I mean Emily...
The tribute to “Friends” one was my favorite 😂
Why is Alexa Bliss in the video?
Mixed queso😂
YO THE FRIENDS REFERENCE
3:55 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love the video just because Alexa bliss is in it
Did they really get Alexa Bliss in this Dude Perfect video
Wow alexa bliss is my girl wwe wrestle dude perfect
Can’t tell if this was a normal stereotype or if someone on the DP cats actually got married
the real question is if it was a real wedding or not
Did they do a reference to the tv show friends when he says the wrong name?
Nice that you put Alexa bliss in your video
Just went to my brothers wedding a couple weeks ago, this should be interesting😂
Rage monster and bridezilla flawless need another won of them
0:17 You can easily tell she's trying not to laugh
Can you do a school Stereotype
Objector to bridezilla was just perfect
anybody notice the freinds reference saying the wrong name
Coby's faces during the slap had me dying
You should do video game stereotypes
1:55 I just realized that’s halloween Marshmello at the back
Please do a “pet stereotypes” video.
That was the best rage monster yet keep up the awesome work.
Pink tie loser!

6:29 clever🤣🤣🤣🤣
The scorching weather should have been Texas weddings
Did anyone like bridezilla? I didnt
At least they will remember that wedding…
2:04 Funny story, on my mom and step father wedding, when they went to cut the cake, it just crumbled on itself we were all confused, until my mom said "what did you do?" To my step-dad. He said that he cut the insides out and ate it, and left the rest of the fondant. We all laughed at the fact that he managed to cut out the entire cake perfectly without destroying it. Yeah I thought it was great
For a tour
Go to London
Ayy it’s Alexa bliss
The  pastor bit was on point😂
I love that Alexa Bliss is in this 😂

Nobody tripped on the bride's dress?
The monster truck tho
Davis jeffery
Absolutely fitting. Rage monster defeated by Alexa Bliss on her DP debut!

Awkward Unity Traditions was the best one🤣

I TAKE THE RACHEL😇🤣🤣🤣🤣

Love dude perfect do more trickshots
Love the Jackie Chan nod with the chair
Who do you think you are I am is such a classic line
Awesome, but you could've run with that whole "Bridezilla" stereotype into a full-length video.  Just sayin'.  ;)
how much did this cost? This is amazing
LOL
The rage monster finally met his match
Was that alexa bliss
Alexa Bliss featuring in DP! Hoping for more such collaborations!
This came out the same day I’m attending someone’s wedding. Which just makes it all the more funny.
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE‽‽‽ I AM!!!🤣
I was just thinking this morning "I want dude perfect to make a new stereotypes video" how ironic
My parents were literally just at a wedding. What is this timing? And they got back when this video released.
This was the best stereotypes video to date. Alexa Bliss was awesome!
They really got Alexa bliss
Friends reference was pure
I Have been waiting. It feels like years. But its all worth it at the end. -Turtle from ninja Turtles
friends reference
Alexa bliss
Me and shrek
By far one of the best if not the best stereo type videos... I love your guys' content! Thank you for all the inspiration and times of entertainment!!
The wedding video being in Comic Sans made it 10x better
That dancing was epic.
You guys are the best love you guys so much❤❤🎉
now that I know it exist, if I ever have another wedding, I now need a Death Star cake.
This is what people picture a wedding looking like
Was not expecting Alexa bliss haha😂
Tyler looks so young because the way he did his hair
Dupe Perfect This Wedding Stereotype Video was Exciting 😁 to Watch 😁 and it was so Awesome 😎 to see one of my favorite female Superstars of WWE Alexa Bliss in this video
Ohh now, rage monster have counter
I love your trick shots do perfect and I love your stereotype videos they always make me entertain
we definantly had a dance circle at my sister's wedding this year🤣🤣
The guy who leaves his suit hanging at home
Congarts on the wifey bro
Less goo hi future gian
I was wondering if it was Alexa Bliss until she turned on the Bridezilla 🤣
Best stereotype video in a long time🤣
What about the dancer grooms
I would say this to the dudes already Can you dudes do thanksgiving stereotypes???
alexa bliss ❤❤
I can so relate to two or three of these! My brother got married in Arizona in the summer and it was totally a scorcher! Also he had a emotional breakdown too! This one was totally relevant! Really sad they didn't have a long winded picture shoot! Prank bros was the best!
Alexa Bliss!!!
I  guys at Spring Hill hotel at New Jersey
This was the best way to get a girl version of the rage monster 😂
tyler is just amazing at being a rage monster, it never gets old.
Bridezilla could play Harley Quinn for that madness hidden within
I died at the Emily and Rachel part 😂
Shocked to see Alexa Bliss but that has to be the best part
lovee the F.R.I.E.N.D.S reference ❤
great vid!
Finally a new vid!!!!😭❤
New rage monster (bridezilla)???
Alexa Bliss and dude perfect dayummmm
DP got a little freaky for a sec
Loved the "Friends" reference. "Do you take Emily as your bride? I take Rachel"
What are the odds that this video drops as I’m at a wedding
1m view here
Needs more terrible wedding photographers 🤭😂
is that a lixea bliss
The best! Especially loved the Will Smith/Chris Rock reference during the “speak now or hold your peace” part
Actually my sister got married 2 weeks ago and this is perfect timing
Best line ever "Who do you think you are. I am!"
The Rage Monster 😂
the quotes " I'm a man I'm 40."
Why did the bridezilla look like Alexa Bliss from WWE
Was she Alexa my celebrity crush😍???
Petition for carnival stereotypes.
Is that Alexa bliss
You didn't do the jealous MIL, mine wore white to our Vegas wedding.
The Pastor Stereotypes and the poorly used bible verses ones were soooo accurate 😂😂
I'm the 1 Millionth viewer!!!!!
Wow! Never expected Alexa bliss here!
Petition for amusement park stereotypes
6:28 nice little Jackie Chan tribute😂
FAKE
I didnt know that was someone crazier than the rage monster!!
did i see alexa bliss from wwe in this video
Rage monster finally met his match.
6:05 onwards THALLUMALA✨️ vibes😂😂
Who a big fan senses their first video???? I am
Thought Cory was gonna rage for the first time in the tie scene
really
You guys got Alexa bliss
just when you thought they couldn't outdo themselves.  *Spoiler*  Never thought they'd introduce a second rage monster into their videos.  I guess you can never have enough violence this day and age...
“Keep my soon to be wife’s name out your mouth!”
I knew it was Alexa Bliss!!!!
That rage monster scene was really interesting, definitely the best rage monster scene since Halloween stereotypes. I like that Ty wasn’t raging on Cody like he always does, and does on Sparky instead. Also the inclusion of Bridezilla was really unique and it felt very fresh.
I wonder how many people got the “who do you think you are I’m am”.  “And I’m a man. I’m 40”  Legendary quotes
I have fainted at a funeral before
pls do mtb stereotypes
rage monster with the rest of the crew
Can you do hockey stereotypes next please?
Love the friends reference 😂
That's the BEST "Stereotypes" video
Where did they get a russian helicopter
this was amazing! 😂
BEST STEREOTYPES EVER!!
I have met Tim.
Best vid in years.
I don’t think anyone expected a cameo from Alexa Bliss
So that’s where Alexa Bliss has been all this time
the bridezella was no match to rage monster
Gotta love that friends reference 😂😂
Is this Alexa bliss👩🏻‍🦳
You see cobys dance at the beginning 0:39
How did y’all manage to get my favorite wrestler in this video Alexa bliss for life
hi
YOOOOO! MRS. ALEXA BLISS IS IN DA HOUSE! I am LOVING this already-
Let's face it a guy like me will never get married
You forgot the Brideless
how did they get alexa bliss on here
Love the new font!
Rage monster was insane 😂
oh...skittles POURING...😶🤭
The rage monster has met his match
You got Alexa bliss
It’s been 7 years and Tyler can still do the rage monster flawlessly.
Hi
"Who are you? Who are your friends?" DP editors, your primary audience is like 9 😂
I like the friends reference with the worst case scenario one
was that Alexa bliss
Bridezilla was unexpected 😂
This has to be the best stereotype video yet. The wedding fight had me in stitches.
The best stereotypes video in history of Dude perfect!!! Not only we had two different gender Rage monsters, but bridezila taking down the og rage moster janitor style is the chery on top
this is so accurate 😂😂❤
Well that was blissful
Alexa stole this video ❤️
Hi 👋
Rage Monster: RAGE Bridezilla: RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGE
I'd rather deal with rage monster than bridezilla
Concert stereotypes next anyone
I knew it was Alexa Bliss in this video!!! Awesome video!
Alexa Bliss did an excellent job🤣🤣
Alexa Bliss?
Like the sneaky line from friends 😉
Didn't know yall got wwe superstar Alexa bliss in the video.
Im always waiting for the rage monster whenever it's a stereotype video
Where is rage monster?
Rage monster after 7 years
Do a SCHOOL STEREOTYPE VIDEO!!!!!!!!!}!!!!!!!!!!
Alexa bliss!!!!
Rage monster rages again...
Theme park stereotypes!
Alexa. ❤️
BEST ONE YET!!!!!!
How fun do you think this video was to film? 😂
The worst case scenario was definitely the most top tier 💀💀
I was a Groomsman on a Scorcher wedding, we were wearing three piece suits. Black On Black  ON BLACK. 🥵
We had a fainter at our wedding. It was you may now kiss the *thud*  At the last wedding I was at, the catering table collapsed during the best man speech which then caught the table cloth on fire. The best man was so into the speech, he didn't realize it was happening.
What a coincidence I'm going to a wedding today
Hi
Cool and funny
Okay, I never expected to see Ty in a suit
new font?
a million veiws in 4 hours !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I think this is my favorite stereotype of all.If y’all make something better than this y’all are masters!!!
Alexa bliss?
Another prank would be to trip the bride on the never ending vail
Best DP stereotype ever!!!!
Ty the rage monster no can stop me  That one girl that can
Aka a bliss?
is that alexa bliss from the wwe
Is that Alexa bliss👀🤔
Alexa bliss?????
Ha ha ha 😂
The friends quote though
Someone beat the rage-monster
Best stereotype video ever 🔥🔥🔥
Alexa bliss spotted😊😊
Rage monster out raged
hello
the wedding vid was actually funny
Is no one gonna talk about dude perfect having Alexa Bliss in this?
watched 15 seconds of this and no idea what this has to do with guys shooting basketballs over 100 ft.
loved this one you know me, and my brother think you guys should do an airsoft stereotype
Not 'The Worst Case Scenario' being Ross's wedding to Emily in Friends!!  Lol 😂😂
Rage Monster forever
Legend says that no one has found the end of the vail
The legendary series is back
FINALLY! 😮
comment #2 on asking for sleepover stereotypes
Best rage monster ever! We even got a female rage monster!
BEST. STEREOTYPE. VIDEO!
Yoooo wedding 😎
Another stereoTYPES WOOOOOOOOOO
birthday party stereotypes
CONGARTS ON THE WIFEY BRO was by far the best line
Newest stereotype :)
The only time Cody didn't cause Ty to rage.
Oh yes!!!
When he said LeBrOn HaS eNtErEd ThE cHaT I felt it so much I almost fainted
Oh yay I forgot about that dog
Yessss thank you dude perfect I love these stereotypes
This video has changed my life
“the bride has entered the chat” 🤣🤣
ham kaise maanle
Let’s gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
wonderful miss bliss like always
When you had your wedding on July 18th at 3:30 PM and it was in fact a Scorcher Wedding.
Funny mike gundy moment
Can you do school stereotypes
Bridezilla, the only person on earth to rival the rage monster
Liar no one can beat rage monster
did someone actually get married when the vid was made.
Why don't you try Art Stereotypes or maybe Cartoon Shows Stereotypes.
HAHAHAHA is all i said this enitire vid
Would love to see you guys do Ice Hockey Stereotypes
Ok I’ve been  watching these videos for a while and I just think tye likes destroying stuff
Finally... A New Rage Monster... and obviously still Tyler of course. The Bridezilla will probably only be for this one though, because it is related to a wedding. But still, Great Job. I love Cory's Face on "The Weird Analogy Pastor."
the cinnamon toast crunch
Imagine not using a clip on tie
Some of the same ideas as Four Weddings and a Funeral.
The guy that doesn't show up
The bridezilla was crazy
I think we've found the rage monsters official wife!
Yes
Awesome Pete Weber reference 5:44
Finally, someone who defeated the rage monster, I'm actually very sad.
wow
is that Alexa Bliss?
Always surprising me with the range monster
Fans: can we please have School stereotypes? Dude perfect: No
Bridezilla = Carrie
At this point im only watching this series for the rage monster.
Alexa Bliss so gorgeous😍
8:49 FRIENDS reference!
Was not expecting the female rage monster 0_0
I love to perfect it’s the best
Wow didn't expect Alexa Bliss to be in the video😂.. She looks absolutely stunning 😍💯.. Great video DP💯👏
Did anyone else appreciate the "FRIENDS" reference? (LOL)
Rage monster (Tyler): *causing chaos and destruction*  Bridezilla: *joins the server, flips him out and steal his scenery*  Rage monster (Tyler): “Wait that’s illegal”
Rage monster: destroys anything he sees Bridezilla: destroys the neibourhood, buildings and the rage monster  Me when 20 second ads that you can't skip and comes at the best part: we all know wnat happens
“Who do you think you are, I am” 😂
"They've chosen yellow and green signifying sunshine and grass" had me dying
Super cool that you guys got Alexa Bliss to join you for this video! Also, it might be a long shot, but “How to tie a tie with Ty” should be a regular series!
7:30 - i guess they were inspired by WhistlinDiesel, right? :D
8:52 Holy cow that legit would be my worst case scenario. My fiancé's name is Emily. Her sister's name is Rachel. That exact scenario would ruin me 😂
We finally found a female rage monster!!! Bridezilla and the rage monster need to be featured more in the future
ALEXA BLISS?????
6:49 Even Corey Taylor would nor be able to do that 🤣🤣😂😂
What about fast food stereotypes
This is funny cus I’m headed to a wedding today 😂
Finally back with the  Stario types
The only time rage monster was defeated
man this is the best stereotypes video...
That was so amazing great job everyone it was so funny
Ummm is that Alexa Bliss?!?!
Love the Friends throwback 🥲🥲🥲
Here
Cogarts on the wifey bro 💀
Y’all never disappoint!
I didn't think they could get any better, and then they made this!!
Dropping a Pete Weber reference!! Fantastic. 😂😂
I live in India, I go to weddings to eat food.
I love the Alexa bliss cameo
Rage Monster be like "AUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU"
Awesome video dude perfect and funniest scene Tyler rage monster and I rage too and Alexa Bliss  bridezilla and this is very funny 🤣😂 dream winning rage monster vs bridezilla
What a collab
Love the "who do you think you are. I am"
2:12 now I know what we were all thinking
Dude perfect could not have picked a better time to release this video. I’m on my way to a wedding RIGHT NOW
6:12 watching that as a guitar player made me cringe so hard
Best one yet!!
Rest In Peace that Bible in the Scorched Wedding.
“WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? I AM” loved that little quote lol
I actually love this video😭
Is that John wick
This might be one of my favorite videos just for the fact of Alexa Bliss giving Ty a suplex into a wedding cake! Absolutely awesome!
This is most funniest thing I see in a year
They're all great,  but Tyler is the GOAT!
Alexa bliss caught me off guard haha
Congrats on the wifey bro
prolly best stereotype video
NAH HOMIE UR THE DA BESTTT😮😮😮😮
Alexaaaa!!!
Ty sister ?
Nothing like some wholesome comedy. Actually funny too. Thanks Dude Perfect! 🙏😅
this is actual chaos, they didnt add one, BUT 2 RAGE MONSTERS
yall are the bestttttt
This reminds me of a wedding I went to a week ago 😂
8:47 I got it
Nice Mike Gundy reference in the rage monster scene. "I'M A MAN, I'M 40!"
the pete weber reference
Can you do a hockey stereotype
You guys should do mall shopping stereotypes
When they break into dance the bride and groom
was alexa bliss in this video or am i tripping
uneven hair cut
gaming stereotypes
they totally should have done the weird style photographer, who make the bride carry the groom and have the best man smooch the bride, or something funny with a crazy photographer, or even a rich wedding with a bunch of photographers wanting to get paid 3 million dollars
That bride might be the scariest person on earth
the best part was seeing Alexa Bliss was shocking
The friends reference tho
Very non relatable..
e
Bridgeville ENTERED THE CHAT! Best line
The monster has been dethroned
Next  wwe fans stereotypes
The Rainy Wedding was my aunt, it was disgustingly muddy and wet probably one of the reasons the that day was a day to remember, in the wrong way
Finally another stereotypes!👍
😂😂😂😂
Alexa Bliss!!!!!!!
8:54 Bro that slap is compared to Will Smith’s
I can’t believe Alexa bliss is in this video!!!! I love her!!!❤❤❤❤ but where’s the classic outro🥺😔
Let's get Dude Perfect tp 60 million subs!!!!!
Oh boy I know what this will mean for Tyler
but we already mixed quesos...
Very nice dude perfect
This is why we call Alexa Bliss Five Feet of Fury, the moment she giving Ty a Suplex into a wedding cake was truly amazing 👌
That throwback Mike Gundy quote caught me so off guard. Been ages since I saw that video 😂
Rage monster and bridezilla was like hulk ans she-hulk
Football stereotypes next?
For non wrestling fans that girl is Alexa Bliss
This is one of the worst videos I’ve seen them do and I never thought I would say it
That  f.r.i.e.n.d.s. Reference was spot-on 👌
Claim your here before a million views ticket 👇
It is always a GREAT day when DP posted 🎉
4:33 I felt bad for the dog. LOL. And nice reference to Friends at 8:28. I also loved it when Garrett was the worst man. I'm just glad you guys decided to do another stay or type video in general as well.
Next stereotype video you guys do, you should do of yourselves
I hate the new font
5:42 Seems like we have heard that before 🤣
Finally, a worthy opponent has stepped forth to take down Rage Monster😡  Behold Bridezilla in all her Glory and Radiance👰‍♀️
We need to see school stereotypes
It’s weird to not see Ty rage at Cody for once
My older brother had part of his wedding outside in Texas a month ago so I felt that one
I haven’t watched the video yet. But please have a joke about ned 😂
Legends say they're still having an emotional breakdown to this day
Friends reference nice
Me never expecting anyone could beat the rage monster😮
Of course There's a Rage Monster in this I knew it 😑 I'm honest with y'all I just saying that the Rage Monster is overrated I'm not just vibing with the Rage Monster as much you know
Love how Alexa Bliss is in this because she just got married
Can't believe Alexa Bliss was in this video
sum
It took me a second to realize that was alexa bliss lol
Best of all stereotype😍
Anyone see the friend's scene
Cool
What about Dating Sterotypes?
All I can think about after watching this is Elsa’s Let it Go “Bridezilla” scene 😂
Heyy, am I the only one to notice the friends show reference?!?
The friends reference 😂
4 hours ago wooooooooooooooooooooo
Mfs when they married
ok
Bike stereotypes
The F.R.I.E.N.D.S scene 😂😂 . I laughed so hard !! 🤣
The disappointing wedding video was so accurate especially with the 3d cube spin transition 😂
Can we all please respect that there is a WWE STAR  I freaking can’t like bridezilla
Next stereotype Arcade?
Ohhh yeaahhhssssww❤❤❤❤❤
Ty being the rage monster what price is going to be paid?
The FRIENDS reference is on point
2:15 Me with my own Neopixel lightsaber: "A duel, this is?"
I love how you guys Collab with one of my favorites wrestler in the girl devesion
Can we talk about how they referenced “Friends” by the “worst case scenario”
Wedding coordinator and wedding video failure are 100%!!!!
“and lebron has entered the chat” 😂😂😂😂
5:22 is that Alexa bliss?
We just got married and were wishing there was a wedding stereotypes video!!
I was not expecting to see Alexa Bliss
I love the fact that Alexa Bliss was in it
The Classic scene from FRIENDS 😂😂
Hotel stereotypes!
Breadzilla power
Alexa bliss 😳
Out of Tyler raging in all of these, blowing up that cake destroyed my life, lol…  3:18
Awesome video!
Ya'll got Alexa Bliss to collab with you? Awesome!
I didn’t know Jackie Chan was a girl
Me going to a wedding today
How to tie a tie with Ty 😂😂😂
probably my favorite stereotype so far from ty's rage to the alexa bliss collab
I love the Friends reference when the groom said Rachel instead of Emily. Very funny.
Is that Alexa Bliss from WWE the bridezilla
Please do school stereotypes
That Friends scene tho 🤣
Never again. I hate weddings.
Who ever did the bridezilla, needs to do more stuff with stereotypes.
I work weddings for a living and this is 100% true
Friends reference 📈📈📈📈📈📈📈
Am not joking but am having a wedding on the day this got released
Who do y'all think is going to win? Alabama or Texas A&M
Friend set
This is one of my favorite stereotypes ever! It was so funny! 😂😂😂
I’m stuck at home, sick, and this made my day!!
They really did the F.R.I.E.N.D.S scene it was awsome lol😂👌

True
Today I have to go to a wedding and this shows up
“Who do you think you are?—I AM!” 🎳
BRIDEZILLA VS RAGEMONSTER LOL
"Your with Ty on how to tie a tie " loved that part
Wow we got 2 rage monsters
6:48 we found something more destructive than the rage monster
5:43 wether it was intentional or not love the pets Weber saying. WHO DO THINK YOU ARE, I AM.
Who else noticed they changed the text font on the stereotypes?
We want school stereotypes!
That was Alexa bliss? WHATTT
alexa bliss suplex was truly a bliss!
Lol!! Another great stereotype video!!  One of the best rage monster too.
It was nice seeing Alexa bliss
Ty doing his rage quitting thing me OK yeah we do this every video when the girl does rage quitting me 👌
Did I just catch a Pete Weber quote? "Who do you think you are, I am!" Lol

Should have the over the top wedding cake or smashing cake in the face ones.
Too Funny 🤣🤣❤️❤️
Yeah I once mixed queso with a beautiful black woman and that’s a deal sealer
My parents had the bad video
I love ty flying trough the cake
The cameos made by Alexa bliss were so awesome
Rage monster is getting old.
I got 2 Brothers, at my oldest brother's wedding here were the following stereotypes: Tie noob (my 2nd brother) Over the top Dj Dance circle Suit struggler (me) Guest wearing white dress the intense wedding planner And the scorcher wedding
That was hilarious! I appreciate the full send fainter.
Hi
Man this gives me memories it’s crazy that’s the movie stereotypes was 8 years ago I love dude perfect I used to watch this in my grandmas room while she made breakfast i miss these days
Alexa Bliss?!
4:47 ain’t no way bruh I thought that was Trevor Phillips
4:52 bliss ? 😍
I love they had a friends show Easter egg with the I take the Rachael instead of Emily
I lost it at "WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? I AM!" 🤣
Whenever a stereotype video comes out i just sit there, waiting for the rage monster🤣🤣🤣
“WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?? I AM!!!”💀💀💀
The stereotype we never expected but loved
5:38 I fr thought this was gonna be a will smith reference 😂😂
8:50 just killed me
I like how in canon, the ultimate counter to the rage monster is 5 feet of Fury
Two rage monsters
Changed the font, huh?
Sar and a lot better
These vids make me so happy!
Haha, Funny this would come out on my wedding day!
yoo
Congarts on the wifey bro
Should have done one with the twins getting swapped
Never thought I'd see the day to see a dude perfect and WWE crossover lol ❤️
Same mate

Is that Alexa bliss
we all be like *waiting for rage monster intensifies* as the video go on
Please do a mountain biking stereotype!
This video was amazing
Serious question; do y’all wait until your wedding night to mix your quesos? Is it a sin to mix your quesos out of wedlock?
is that alexa bliss
This is honestly the best stereotypes video ever made by DP. The little things like the friends reference are so well executed and I could watch this over and over again and still laugh!
Well i thought tye would wear shorts with tuxedo
Alexa channeled her inner Fiend
4:55 Alexa Bliss lite
I need to see someone pull off the extravagant exit 😂
The Emily and Rachel one 😭
I love the Friends joke about Emily-Rachel mishap
I love stereotypes it's always so funny and makes my day when ever they upload them.
Lexi Cabreraaaaaaaa
Unbelievable
“WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? I AM!” Love the subtle nod to Pete Weber
Love the name mix up in relation to that one episode in Friends😂
that remix transition from the EDM to the stereotypes theme was spot on.
is that Alexa bliss
They pulled out the friends show
now i know how MY extravagant exit will be like.
Is that WWE’s Alexa bliss at 4:55
Come after me, I'm a man, I'm 40  References I didn't know I needed
Bro I would've broke out of character no joke 😂🤣🤣 0:15
Hmmm...in the last few weddings I've attended, none of the women wanted to catch the bouquet.
Just a thought but … THANKSGIVING stereotypes.  Family’s “friendly” Turkey bowl  Classy dinner  Food coma  The Who can eat the most plates  And flannel pictures
Awesome to have Alexa Bliss in the video!
What is alexa bliss doing here
Ty teaching how to tie ties😂
Friends Ross!!!!!!!!!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Avatar hair connect 😂
I'm shooting another wedding this afternoon and I needed this 😄  😂
Youth sports stereotypes
I saw Alexa Bliss I clicked the video
Is this alexa bliss?
The Rage Monster never gets old, add Bridezilla and this just gets ten times better LOL 😂
my jaw hurts from touching the floor on how awesome the rage monster and bridezilla was!
Alexa bliss 😂
Is that Alexa bliss
BRIDEZILLA
Oh yeah we are back with steryotypes
4:55 at first i thought that was Alexa Bliss XD
Bridezilla is the only one that can stop the Rage Monster
The greatest wedding ever
Is that Alexa bliss?
Ok, The Worst Case Scenario was an obvious reference to F.R.I.E.N.D.S because on the series, Ross did make that big mistake
am i tripping or was that alexa bliss?'
I’ve been in a dance circle before, it was actually really fun.
Dis is great
Loved the 2nd rage monster "bridezilla" you guys should make more like this 🤣🤣
TY honestly if he wanted he could do a match and be actually awesome at it he sold that suplex well with his energy he could be better than pat mcafee and bad bunny if he trains well
5:42 Will Smith, Chris Rock moment.....Loved it.
its crazy how I've watched these stereotype videos since I was in elementary and now im in college 😭
Awesome Alexia Bliss in your video. I love the stereotypes videos...🤣😂🙂
U can never have a stereotype video without the rage monster 😂
I’m going to one today perfect timing
wait... i thought Garrett lost his ring....
I thought that was Bliss lol
Bro who else thought that rage monster and bridezilla were going to team😂
The pink haired bride looks like alexa bliss
5:45 "WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? I AM" 😂 legendary
I LOVE stereotypes!
Bridezilla was a great addition🤙🤣
My favorite part is "The rage monster" vs "Bride zilla."😂😂
Looks like Rage Monster have a Competition
Where was the car prank stereotypes?
Guys we need more of bridezilla and rahe monster together
The FRIENDS reference 😂
This one is one of the best I swear 🤣
School stareotyes
Next you could do school/college stereotypes.
The girl at :55 spitting out water 😂😂
I love how the guy who was marrying my cousins Becca and kai was the funniest guy to make them marry he explained that 4 beers in at a party he said “it’s so easy even I could do it”
Derek:see ya
Yo y’all should do NBA2K23 stereotypes like y’all did with Madden
I only came here for Alexa Bliss lol 😂
i think this the most funny one out of all of them XD
ALEXA BLISS
5:46 nice Pete Weber reference, I honestly did not expect a PBA hall of famer to be referenced in a DP video
I recently watched the oldest Dude Perfect Stereotypes, and I couldn't help comparing it to wine. It only gets better with age
This was me 1 month ago.
Really snuck the friends reference in there
Well ok then! 😂😂😂😂 ideas..hmmmm
I love these 😊
A double rage monster I love it
Not the old OSU coach meme quote 😂😭😭😭
Yes
Running out of ideas. Video gonna tank.
Oh my goodness I didn't expect a Pete Weber "who do you think you are I am" lol
Best rage monster scene ever 😂
I’m helping th aligratj
You can't go overboard with the ragemonsters
Who do you think you are I am
Anyone saw the camera on the how to tie a tie
Sparky in a cowboy hat looks just like David Koechner's character in anchorman
Awesome!
The show off guy is definitely panda
This was the best video ever!!!!!

Dude, all the iconic quotes before the rage monster was the greatest thing dude perfect has ever done
They really got Alex bliss I’m the vid
Hey July 18
Alexa bliss cameo!!!!
That was the best and true, thanks
NGL, I thought the Tie Struggle would be the cause of the Rage Monster.
The rage monster going into the bridezilla, then the runaway bride was my favorite part.
Anyone love the rage monster?😍
Love this!! 😂😂😂 As a wedding planner, I can confirm these are ALL accurate! And love doing weddings at The Grand Ivory - such a pretty venue!
Day 1747295910482 of asking for soccer stereotypes
Thank you miss bliss for putting the rage monster trough a table 😂😂😂
Rage monster can be defeated ???!!!!!!!?!?!?!!? impossible
Saw the notification for this video while I'm at a wedding
Tie noob and trouble maker brother because that's me
it actually hit me hard when ty went "see how hard it is to pull somebody up, now look how easy it is to pull them down"
I was like,she looks a lot like alexa  bliss lol
I work weddings, and I can confirm all of these things happen.
Anyone gonna talk about Kevin (Sparkys) eyes?
You need to do like video games sterotypes or road trip sterotypes
Gotta love the fact that they added the Will Smith line 😂
Love the FRIENDS reference in the 'Worst Case Scenario' bit, with the Emily and Rachel, great attention to detail DP!
10:08 congarts on the wifey bro 😂😂😂😂😭

Wasn’t ready for Alexa Bliss! This is one of the best Stereotypes Vids ever
My uncle has a wedding today what a coincidence
Jesus loves you
I Love these. Bridzilla, oh yeah, Ty had no chance.
Really outdid this one, but a little disappointed that the Rage Monster was defeated so easily by Bridezilla. Maybe this is the key to ending the Rage Monster entirely?
I would be Mr count-the-seconds-until-I-can-go-home
Vine para ver a Alexa bliss... El vídeo redivertido 👌🏻😁
I swear I saw Alexa bliss in the video
Alexa Bliss?!?!

Nice and funny video
They never dissapoint with a stereotype video
Finnaly more steryotepyes
5:45 Like the bowling reference, didn’t know Dude Perfect was into that.
Didn't realize Alexa Bliss was in this 🔥
The Mike Gundy quote really did it for me! 😂

Why is Alexa bliss in a dude perfect video
Bridezilla was AWESOME!!!!
Who do you think you are I am!  - 🐐
Alexa bliss killed this🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Where was the guy that proposes to his girlfriend during the wedding??
Tyler: A circle keeps going  Cory: Just like this sermon 😂
It felt like rage monster did a less damage over there
Amazing like always 😍
They got alexa bliss for this! 😍

Alexa Bliss for the win, gets put over by dude perfect more than wwe
I love how Cory and Coby were always in the back it was so hilarious

I was waiting for the rage monster part....loved it 😂
BRIDEZILLA HAS ENTERED THE CHAT!!
Congarts on the wifey bro

BRIDEZILLA YASSS

Am I the only one that realized sparky said “keep my soon to be wife’s name out of your mouth.” Just like at the Oscars
Love the Pete Weber reference lol. Who do you think you are? I AM!!!!

I thought the rage monster would destroy the cake
What abt a school stereotype?
Common Ty w

Anyone that spin is a literal legend
Poor cody in that tite shirt
To all wwe fans you will know that is alexa bliss
Why was I actually just waiting for this video since the beginning of stereotypes? 😂😂😂
Hiiiiiii
The best Stereotype video 🤣🤣🤣
School Stereotypes will be awesome with the Nerd Kid The Teachers Pet and Annoying Teachers It will so funny.
Boooooooooooo
8:47 love the friends reference
You guys got Alexa Bliss on Dude Perfect that's amazing
the rage monster finally got put in his place
Aren't we gonna talk about that former WWE diva Alexa Bliss in this video, or is it just me? Haha
😂😂😂😂😂😂
I'm here for Alexa bliss.
Alexa bliss is an absolute unit. I’ll never get to see her suplex Ty in a cake again
Never expected to see Alexa Bliss in a dude perfect video, but I’m all for it
How to tie a tie.. with ty 😂
Never disappoints
BRO!!! My cousin got married at that same venue a couple years ago!!!!!!!!!
Epic timing as I am fixing to head out the door to my Nephew's wedding!!!
Yes. Another great stereotype!
I love that Alexa bliss was In a dp video the collaboration we thought we never thought about
Already 500,000veiws plus more

Two hours
You HAVE to do a birthday stereotypes😂
Was that Alexa bliss😂
"Worldstar we out here" hahaha
Is that Alexa bliss
congrats 🎉🎊🍾🎈
I LOVED that ALEXA BLISS was in this video it definitely my fav❤ stereotype. Never quit YouTube DUDE  PERFECT your AMAZING at your job I love AlEXA BLISS also
My only gripe with this video as someone who runs weddings (not a coordinator, just the clean up, set up, food, etc.) Is that the bridezilla is portrayed as valid in this one. 9/10 timed the bridezilla is judt entitled and rude! We have lots of very sweet brides, but when you get a bridezilla..... its usually not something we did or have control over. Shes just a b****....
Everything about this was so hilarious and so true!
The fact they were able to get Alexa bliss in a video is a dub
Was she Alexa bliss??
The best video !!!
The bridzella reminds me of Alexa bliss wwe
Loved it haha
Idk who I am I’m 12
tie noob
Bridezilla with the jiu-jitsu 🤣👌
Funny seeing Alexa bliss
Bridezilla needs to make a return imagine 2 rage monsters
Loved the friends reference
My Best Man exp is 1000% accurate.
My favorite had to be the disappointing wedding video... I don't know why, but that had me cry-laughing😂
is that alexa bliss
I’m literally getting ready for my sister’s wedding right now
Nice reference to ‘friends’ at the ‘worst case scenario’ part. Saying Rachel Instead of Emily😂😂. Love from the Netherlands! 🇳🇱 Keep it up!
Very noiceee
sooooooo funny
Do school stereotypes
The segments were a bit boring this time, but the rage monster scene was wild! Instead of one, there's two rage monsters! That's interesting.
Can’t believe that Alexa bliss was in the vid lol
Bridezilla has entered the chat  Rage Monster : Finally, a worthy opponent. Our battle will be legendary. Boomstick : *It's time for a DEATH BATLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLE !!*
Is this Stereotypes: Wedding? I don’t think that animation occurred enough times.
Was that alexa bliss
I came here to see Alexa Bliss.. 😁
I watched bcoz Alexander is there huge fan
8:48 Best part in the video
Amazing just love u guys

I don’t like it when you destroyed a nice blue guitar I hate it I’m leaving a dislike
Love the Mike Gundy reference. The Friends reference, too. I never expected to see Alexa Bliss in a DP video. That was awesome!
Hey there is nothing wrong with July 18 it’s my bday
When he said Rachel I just burst out laughing because I just finished that episode
So cool the got WWE Superstar Alexa Bliss for this video especially since she just married pop star Ryan Cabrera so she probably had some fresh memories of some of these stereotypes 😂
Ey yo where the trick shots at?
THAT FRIENDS REFERENCE! EEEK 8:49
The amount of people here who likely missed the Who do you think you are I am and I'm a man I'm 40, lines .. I feel bad for you
YOO THE FRIENDS REFERENCE WITH THE WRONG NAME
BRIDZILLA!!!!! Nobody ruins the Goddess of WWE's wedding!!!!!

Bridezilla was an epic twist 😂
I could t relate to any of these cuz of… my own reasons.
That’s normal for a wedding. Just causally have a monster truck on the side.😂

Love from India
Other: *Watching The Whole Video* Me: *Skipping And Finding The Rage Monter's Second*
I loved the spin on Rage Monster for the Bride! Bridezilla XD. Truely a masterpiece of a video!

I was hoping Bliss would briefly turn back to her "fiend" character and lay waste to all the attendees.
I’m here for Alexa
Love the friends reference
I love stereotypes
One of the most entertaining rage monsters i've ever seen
love how they added friends emily rachel switchup!

They forgot the bored kids at the reception!
0:54 The subtle touch of spitting the water out...hilarious! (had to back up to see it)

Way to long of a video.
The only think that can match a rage monster! BRIDEZILLA!!! *Coming to a theater near you.*

I love the video, just wish the guitar wasn't destroyed
School stereotypes please
The rage monster has met his match
One of the most funniest rage monsters ever

They got Alexa bliss in a dp video
Dude love the content but where’s panda? And remember garret you promised if dude perfect could tie the pie panda would revile it’s true identity so keep pumping out the vids and growing that sub count pound it noggin see YAA!!!
As a WWE fan I never expected Dude Perfect would ever do a video featuring a WWE wrestler. I also did not expect that Alexa Bliss would be the BRIDEZILLA character. This video is the best stereotype video of all, in my opinion.
Hold up was that Alexa bliss
BRIDEZILLA VS RAGE MONSTER . Battle of the angry heads
Alexa is on fireee woooooooo❤️❤️
I just hated 1 thing that the add poped up exactly after the rage monster intro
Y’all need to do tennis stereotypes next

Did not expect to see Alexa
Its the “how to tie a tie” for me😂
Best vid of all time
This time it wasn’t Cody who triggered Tyler’s inner rage monster.
Never thought I'd see Alexa Bliss in a DP video. Awesome. 😂😎
Alexa Bliss was great in this! 🔥

The first part of the video already got me
Who would ever think dude perfect would collab with a wrestle Alexa bliss
At 4:40 is that Alexa Bliss?
best ever channel to post stereotypes
Am I the only one who thinks they need more cameos in all their stereotype videos?  Alexa Bliss was awesome!!!!
I appreciate the Friends reference
The monster truck part really killed it
What are the odds I am in a wedding today😂😂😂
Who else really wants school stereotypes
We need school stereotypes
This was the series that introduced me to DP

Rage monster:All time favorite . Cant be missed😅🥳
Why did this get recommended to me, I have a wedding to attend TODAY! 😂
Alexia bliss ?
The annoying kid?

This literally came out on my friends wedding day
Where are them bloopers?
2:30 for a second I legit thought coby was gonna be the rage monster
Jesus loves you so much forever
"We already mixed queso's"  Using that next time someone dumps me🤣

First time in this era THE RAGE MONSTER WAS DEFEATED this should be written in the history books
My new favorite stereotype video 🤣
I’m the one who struggles with ties.

Where is military wedding or unexpected guest or wedding crashed?
School stereotypes?
Oh that's Alexa bliss bro!?
Did not expect Alexa Bliss
Amen
This is amazing. the work and effort they put into this is phenomenal
It seems like Ty got a tuff competitor out there..
Alexa bliss was in this
Football Obsessed Groomsman
Alexa bliss❤❤
Me: (Kills the bride)
"I John, Take you Rachel"...you got that from F.R.I.E.N.D.S right??

for the first time someone stopped our monster 👿
Gr8
Ok bridezilla was a nice detail to put in
Alexa bliss manh!! ❤️
Haha stereotypes 😂 love these 😊
Hats off to to these guys 😉
Never expected the rage monster to be given a rare defeat. We need a backstory and more confrontations between bridezilla and the rage monster. Maybe one day, it could even become a feature film, with an entire fictional universe's worth of lore behind it..
I thought I would never see another stereotypes video I feel like it’s been forever since they uploaded another one
Ok now do School Stereotypes.
Bridezilla that’s a nightmare coming
Hotel Stereotypes please!?
Is that Alexa bliss
Gonna be honest wish the bridezill vs rage monster battle was longer
My sister got married YESTERDAY 🎉
Rage was FINALLY defeated
Very well written video as usual guys!
Fun video. Missed opportunity on the slow dance that turns into a rehearsed dance 🕺
I can picture that veil being in Africa
Still have never done a football stereotype
Go alexa bliss 🤣🤣🤣
I love the Pete Weber reference Ty 🤣
Vacation steryotypes
Was that alexa bliss?? I'm confused haha
Is it just me or does anyone else see Alexa Bliss from WWE in this?
Nobody is gonna say anything about “Alexa Bliss”
5:17 it’s Alexia Bliss!!
Love that will smith and friends reference
“Who do you think you are? I am!!” I don’t think many caught onto that but round of applause for one of the funniest sports moments ever. Thank you DP
I can confirm that I will soon be the emotional break down and suit struggle guy :D
6:33 literally me 💯😂
Here's Ty teaching how to tie a tie
Love you Dude Perfect 🥰
Love to see the subtle reference to Mike Gundy
I love that there were technically two rage Monsters!
This is a bit cringe
Im going to wedding today, thanks for that
I don't know, I didn't find this to funny. I miss the older content this channel would upload
How long did it take you to make this.
Petition to include rsge monster's female version ___zilla in every stereotype with her😂🤝
Rage monster was the best of all
7:12 Would've been funny if she gave Ty a WEDGIE 🤣🩲
Who could dislike this video. It's incredible or we can say it's perfect
Bridezilla out-raged the Rage Monster! 😂
Wow the Rage Monster was the best as always.
That friends reference though 👌🏼👌🏼 spot on
Bridezilla is every caveman’s dream wife.
Wow the wedding was on my bday.
Watching this video when I'm about to be at a wedding tomorrow lol
isn’t that alexa bliss ?? 😂
Yooo im early
What a coincidence I’m going to a wedding next week! Also I want that Death Star cake
At first I thought that the Rage Monster was going to be the bride, but then Bridezilla appeared. That was the best moment of the video and so true
The rage monster will forever be the best part
Ur videos are amazing I love them😂👍♥️
"Who do you think you are, I am" hits dofferent when it comes from Ty😂
July 18 is my birthday🤭
The twins are playing their roles so well! 😂
Is she Alexa Bliss? 4:55
Why is Alexa Bliss in the video?
8:48 I immediately remembered friends😂 Even the same names were in the video
Why is my comment pinned for no reason?
You guys are so INSPIRATIONAL
The rage monster has met his match
Disappointed there wasn’t a section where Ty and Cody were watching college football during the ceremony
Someone actually stood up to the rage monster and won?  I must be dreaming.
Asome vid hay from Zimbabwe 🇿🇼
Was not expecting WWE superstar Alexa Bliss to be in a DP video
ALEXA!!!!!!!
All the reasons why I'll never get married. Great video DP!

I LOVE friends so that little add-on was so funny!😂
Love the friends twist
Like the objection and rage one🤣🤣
i love dp stereotypes
TY did a girl really take you out 😐
This was useful 😂, I am currently planning my wedding and this gave me a lot to think about 😂
Best wedding ceremony ever...
This might be one of my favorite videos just for the fact of Alexa Bliss giving Ty a suplex into a wedding cake! Absolutely awesome!
10:57 this could have gone incredibly wrong if it slipped from the waist to the neck, after slipping of the other loop from the leg of course
Is that Alexa Bliss?
Amazing ♥️
Yaah more stereotypes
In case you are wondering they store in the registry clip is called Sun and Ski Sports in Frisco TX. I used to work there not too long ago
It’s been 9 years and Tyler can still do the rage monster flawlessly.
I never knew the rage monster could be defeated
_BRIDEZILLA/THE RUNAWAY BRIDE HAS JOIN THE BATTLE FOLKS_ The Rage Monster , _"FINALLY WORH IT OPPONENT!"_  *TRM VS BZ*
what dude is your favorite? I like gar
I love that Coby and Cory were in agreement with Ty for the rage monster. Had me laughing so hard
“Who do you think you are, I am”   Bruh😂😂😂
Absolutely loved all the famous quotes mixed in there!
This was also educational for me, I now know who not to invite in my wedding later on in life.
I never expected this when dudeperfect
Suggestion: School stereotypes
Who’s the blonde women with a pink streak in her hair ?
Coby: TAKE A SEAT PAL! 😂😂😂😂😂 Dude, now we have two rage monsters😂😂
bro the helicopter exit though
And the bride has enter the chat caught me laughing so hard.
Congarts on the great video, bros!!!!
Let's go Alexa Bliss in the house 🌟💯

Alexa Bliss was the perfect choice for Bridezilla! Awesome cameo!
4:41 is that alexa bliss ? Edit- Yeah can confirm she is in the later scene
Wasn't expecting Alexa Bliss to be a part of this video; nonetheless, great cameo and great video.
4:53 Alexa bliss a former wwe superstar and a former smack down and raw women’s champion.

I didn't expect Alexa bliss making a cameo in this video

Never thought to see Ty in a suit with a mullet lol
School stereo types

When I saw bridezilla coming in I knew  this would be the greatest stereotype video ever
nobody talks about alexa bliss
Is that bridezilla who I think it is
6:48  the doom music kicks in
Love it guys!!!! 😂
The Bridezilla looks very very familiar.. 🤔

I love to wake up and see a new Dude Perfect video and I also went to the tour in Arizona
Bro bridezilla was the best thing in this vid
Woooooooooooo
Bridezilla vs Rage Monster 😮🤯
It’s funny because July 18 my birthday
The choreography of Bridezilla is better than most Marvel movies
Literally bridezeilla and friends were perfect...m
As a fellow Texas bro, I couldn’t agree more…   “You had the nerve to schedule a Texas wedding, OUTDOORS, JULY 18th…. AT 3:30?!?!”
Videographer flew the drone into my face durning the first look and cut my ear lobe off. At least he didn’t hit my wife.
This video probably cost more than a wedding
“Who do you think you are, I am” 😂😂😂😂😂
I never expected to have a religion pushed on me like this before, but oh well
The Rage Monster scene was EPIC!!
Still a better love story than Twilight
No!!! Not the cake!!!!
this is easily the best video yet, so funny
Such a great video! Acting was on point
Awesome
I like your new cut Tyler😂
Like the old ourtro
ALEXA BLISS 😯😯😯😲😲😲

They had to do the friends scene of Ross and Rachel. Epic...
Alexa bliss 🤩🤩🤩 👿
“Who do you think you are, I am!!” Bahahahhaa
Was that Alexa Bliss?????
This Stereotype video was pretty funny. Next one should be amusement park stereotypes, you could to the “screamer”, “rigged games player” the “over the top booth announcer” and “the person that buys season passes every year but only goes twice”
When u lock up your knees when standing for so long🤣🤣🤣 so relatable
Was that Alexa bliss in the video
Before this video: The Rage monster is unbeatable After this video: in my dreams now
Pls. Just do school stereotypes
You guys should do a video on Frisbee stereotypes
Tyler suit speaks for itself

Anyone notice that alexa bliss was in this?
You know, I am not letting Mike Leach plan my wedding.
Alexa bliss?
Dude, my mom’s wedding is literally happening today. Couldn’t have timed this better
Was that Alexa Bliss???
I can’t believe they made a callback to that chaotic Friends wedding where Ross says the wrong name. Also, they finally had a female Rage Monster.
Alexa Bliss!!!
School stereotypes next?
I’m suit struggles for sure! Had pants that were 6 inches too short one wedding
TBH, Cory and Coby were the best audience in every stereotypes
Dude perfect and Alexa Bliss collab. I've seen it all
Stereotypes videos are the best!
Prank Bros was my favorite by far.
The FRIENDS reference hade me 💀
Cody and the big suit guy i forgot his name need to change suits
Me who lives in indiana has went to just 1 wedding, and it was the windiest day ever. ( it was inside however)
Loved the bowling reference 😂
Never in my life I thought I would ever see someone beat the rage monster
5:46 I like the reference
Why does dude perfect make the funniest of all videos 😂
Still love beach stereotypes more
Was that Alexa Bliss??
You forgot "the night after" 👀
sounds like "bridezilla" could give the rage monster some competition for who can do the most destruction xD
3:34 I'm already getting flashbacks of Metal Detector Battle 🤣
dude not perfect 😑
July 18th is one day before my birthday 😂😂
*The BRIDE enters the chat*
If you caught this video faster than any other upload 👇
NOT THE CAKE🥲
Great video but y’all forgot “when the ceremony is behind schedule” lol
Oh my goodness. I almost died laughing at the prank bros, especially when I pictured doing that at my cousin's catholic wedding.
Anyone else see the freinds reference at 8:48
BRIDEZILLA W00000000000000000!
Still waiting for neighborhood stereotypes
WHAT IS ALEXA BLISS DOING HERE
Alexa Bliss made stereotypes a lot better cuz now we see a female rage monster

So that WAS Alexa Bluss right?
I can’t with the Will Smith reference, that was amazing
Alexa bliss as the bridesmaids pretty awesome
Pls do school stereotypes and include mr complainer
Well, I never expected to recast friends famous "I take thee rachel"
The mike gundy quote is the greatest addition
Slightly disappointed we didn’t get a twisted bliss but I was dying too much to care.
I really love when they quote the Bible.
wow new font and two rage monsters in one video crazy
Should’ve done the honeymoon
This is the best and the creative  stereotypes so far.Dude perfect forever .love u all

This is awesome! Lol mostly white pastors are long winded as 🔥 lol. My cousins pastor was black. The ceremony was over in like 15 minutes. It was great hahaha
I’m getting married a week from today, now I know what to keep an eye out for 🤣
U need to make a school stereo types that would be great
The rage monster has finally met a worthy opponent.
I never knew there was so much about a wedding that could be stereotyped.  It was also a twist that for the first time in a while, the Rage Monster was defeated. Didn't expect the girl version of the Rage Monster, either.
Best Stereotype yet.
They brought Alexa bliss
LESS GO

Rage Monster 2
Angry one
Being in the season of life where a lot of my friends are getting married, this is great.

“Keep my wife’a name out your mouth” was so unexpected 😂. That smacked pretty hard
The prank brothers. 5 STARS!!!!

You guys should do arcade stereotypes
bridezilla is the BEST THING i’ve seen in ages 😂😂
You guys should do traveling stereotypes since there would be so much you could do with hotels and planning and all of that
Alwase brings me a smile when I see a dp notification
I never expected an Alexa bliss & dude perfect Collab
Did you notice it! At "the worst case scenario" they actually made the scene where Ross marries Emily in the Series "Friends" Great job guys keep it up!
I love how the twins are just so energetic and are cheering when bridezilla went all wwe on ty
It's was incredible how you put that friends reference It was hilarious

“Do you feel anything?” “Not really” “Maybe we’re not meant to be together” “But…we already mixed quesos 😯”
Im leaving to go to a wedding in 1 hour lol
4:53 Alexa Bliss?!?!?
My absolute favorite was the bad video I loves the congrates in the wifey bro. HAHA
Gila si ini, ga nyangka yg biasanya main game barbar bisa buat konten kocak ke gini 👍👍👍
Two rage monsters in one video what did we do to deserve this😂👍
I like the Scene that was like friends

W

E
This is funny to me because I’m going to one today
My family memories are getting married to Day
Next should be blitzball stereotypes
My sister Amanda had a rainy wedding. As a matter of fact, Wednesday marked her 9 year wedding anniversary. The day of her wedding, the weather was nice in the morning. I checked the radar on my phone because I noticed there were dark clouds approaching. Sure enough, there were some heavy showers approaching the area. So, my younger brother, myself and the limo bus driver decided to go back to the limo bus. As soon as all 3 of us stepped foot onto the limo bus, it started torrentially downpouring. Mind you, this was when they were about to start wedding pictures. It was wild.
Very nice
8:30 best speech ever created🔥🔥
The "Double" RAGE MONSTERS LOL.
The video I never knew I needed...until now
Alexa Bliss?
girl boss lol
“And the bride has entered the chat!”
Probably the best one so far
2 things 1. I LOVE the groom cake 2. I like how they referenced friends with the worst case scenario.
Garrett losing the rings. Imagine that
That Death Star cake is amazing
I wasn't ready for the effort put into making this video. It was over thr top!
You guys missed a golden opportunity for trashing the bride and grooms car
I want to crash a wedding!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Who else agrees that dude perfect makes the BEST and funny stereotypes?
Day 1 of asking for school stereotypes
You missed having in-laws fighting with each other about the wedding
I don’t get the locked knees one, anyone care to explain??
Marriage is just like a walk in jurassic park
4:54 is that Alexa bliss
Who else agrees that dude perfect makes the BEST and funny stereotypes?
Who else agrees that dude perfect makes the BEST and funny stereotypes?
Alexa bliss
wait is that alexa bless from wwe?
The Mike Gundy reference was priceless
My wedding was at 5:00 in August in Central California. I lost 5 lbs during my wedding because it was 108 degrees outside. 0/10. Would not recommend. Was a scorcher for sure
Who else agrees that dude perfect makes the BEST and funny stereotypes?
Didn't expect to see Alexa Bliss, she did great.
Amazing
Rage Monster and Bridzilla and Runaway Bride. Who knew that would work. Thats a Dream wedding.
They even got a scene from friends. Legends
Yea they all look weird
Best videos
no way i was just rewatching your old stereotype videos!
no way i was just rewatching your old stereotype videos!
Oof  the rage monster at a messing that’s embarrassing
I neverI never thought that I’d see a rage monster as a girl
Ahh the Rage monster... We all do have a rage monster inside us!
The "come after me IM A MAN IM 40" got me 😂😂    i know the reference
Bro the way I knew which analogy he was doing when he told him to get up on the chair 💀💀💀💀
bring back wives vs chad
Bond for life in the style of Avatar 🤣
I’ve been waiting for this for almost two weeks. I love the stereotypes!
Bridezilla changes everything! 😂😂😂😂
Bro, the bridezilla is Alexa Bliss from wwe, am I right?
My heart died when you blew up that Death Star cake
Rage monster in this too.not one but two
Alexa Bliss <3
Was that alexa bliss??
Alexa bliss made it 😩🥰❤❤
Moment of appreciation for the person who tagged all the red oak leaves so that Ty could easily purchase them
Y’all are so cool don’t stop you can do it
Scorcher wedding….every texas wedding
Can you pleaseeeeee do a drive thru stereotypes.!!
The rage monster is inevitable.
Alexa Bliss is in the video!!
Y’all got Alexa Bliss tho???👀👀👀
Competitive people at a dance-off: It do go down
I did not expect WWE Alexa Bliss collab with dude perfect, its awsome🤣🤣🤣
was the girl on 4:56 alexa bliss from wwe?
A double rage monster! I never would’ve expected that!
Can't believe they got alexa bliss to do a dude perfect video
Him talking about Jael in the Bible was hilarious!! 😂
“Man that’s not really my thing”  *proceeds to do a backflip*
Smack down pow 😂😂😂 Bruh I wasn't expecting Alexa to be a part of this video but oh man I loved it
This is bad dude perfect wedding day
Also, NGL, I thought that one of the stereotypes was going to be the bride running off with someone else, with Bridezilla leaving her fiance at the wedding and running off with Rage Monster. They fight each other, then RM sees BZ destroy the gazebo with the monster truck and falls for her. They act like the 2 of them together calms their rage, but then instead they just cause more destruction but while smiling and laughing and skipping.
Scorcher wedding was my favorite
Who else wants school stereotypes?
BRIDEZILLAAAAAAAAA
Probably the first time the rage monster was not summoned by Cody
Forgot Saturday weddings during college football season
We need this Alexa Bliss in WWE soon 🔥🔥🔥
Love the different style of editing.
Ok is that Alexa Bliss from wwe with the pink hair?
i never knew how hilarious Ty is as a pastor
Wow! I love how you guys just keep coming up with great ideas! I love this series!!
Alexa bliss cameo 😂
Well... None of these would happen near future nor past to me
You can always suspect when the rage monsters is about to happen😂
Best one so far!
I hope all you guys are going through goes awesome and know that I truly don’t know what it’s like. 🙏🙏🙏
Is that Alexa bliss
First time ever, Bridezilla introduced!!!! The girl version of the rage monster!
I'm surprised Cody was left untouched  and unharmed by the Rage Monster this time.😂😂
Heh. Going to a wedding today.
Alexa bliss in dp
Is nobody going to talk about Alexa Bliss!
Alexa Bliss!! Y'all goated for having her in a video💯
4:57 is that Alexa bliss
THE PETER WEBER QUOTE
I'm literally going to a wedding today couldn't have come out at a better time
WORLDSTAR
im the guy whos never gonna get married
The Alexa Bliss cameo 😂
This was the funniest
Hmm
Love the “Friends” reference 😂
Like this if they should make boat/lake day stereotypes.
The friends reference is everything
A long time awaited for this masterpiece
Ok, the inappropriate Bible verses one is so real. The officiant at my uncle’s wedding said that Baalum and his donkey were the perfect example of Biblical marriage. I would remind everyone that Baalum abused the donkey multiple times in that story.
look at the camera mans make up 0:01
Great vid!
Anyone else ever wonder if this is how all the DP guys experienced their wedding?😂
Don't lie everyone was wanting for the rage monster
I cant belive the rage monster got deafeted by bridezilla and cake?
You should do baseball stadium stereotypes for mlb postseason
Alexa Bliss 🖤💗
This has Got to be the Best Stereotype Video Ever 🙌
One of the best topics on youtube is the dp stereotypes 😍
7:15 ty got defeated
WHEN ARE YOU GUYS GOINĢ TO SPACEEE
lets be honest we only wanted to see the rage monster
Thats funny, to struggle to smile for wedding and be ready.
Nice mate !!
I just can't bare hoe coby and Cory  laugh at every moment
this actually classifies as a childhood classic for me. Up there with Parkourse with Ryan Higa.
Bridesilla looked so much like the wrestler Alexa bliss
Alexa bliss??
It's Magnificent 💫⚡️💫💫❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️looking for more such amazing stereotypes, beside watching the previous cool ones hundreds of times 😅❤️
Friends reference 😂
I love how the rage monster is getting better every time
Bridezilla LOLLL😂
never thought i’d see alexa bliss in a dude perfect video but that’s pretty dope
after a long time i liked ur video we want old DP  back
Didn’t even recognize Alexa Bliss
Can you do School steriotipes(from South Afrika)
The friends reference was golden
You Completely forgot the wedding during a sporting event
Is that alexa bliss?
You guys should do homecoming stereotypes
Am I tweaking or is that Alexa Bliss?????
I guess we have a girl rage monster now. Also, that was a huge monster truck.
Yes! After so long we finally got to see the female Rage Monster! Booyah!
I DID NOT SEE THE BRIDEZILLA COMING
STEREOTYPES WEDDING  The INTENSE Wedding planner was really rude 😂
WHERE DO YOU GUYS FIND A WWE SUPERSTAR
Im surprised that so many people did not realize that Alexa Bliss from WWE is in this video
That was the most awesome video 😂😂😂😂😂
Love this! The Bridezilla was amazing! Also another stereotype could’ve been “Awkward First Kisser”
Yo they put Alexa bliss in the video. She is a wwe superstar!
This was great! Video idea: Neighbor Stereotypes.
Let’s go
Plz do MINIGOLF and HOCKEY stereotypes!
Hoping for hotel stereotypes
I guess it's more fun to record this than to have to see it. This is probably the worst thing you've done in a very long time. You guys are usually funny. :)  Or maybe it's harder to relate to when you don't live in the US
A NEW RAGE MONSTEER TWO TOO TO! Underrated
👍
Not expected Alexa bliss to be in the video 😊😊 Loved it literally 😍😍😍
Love your videos
Didnt expect friends 🙃🙃
Learn how to tie my tie from a YouTube video back in freshman homecoming dance
I can’t believe they featured Alexa bliss on this video I’m happy to see her on the video.
The rage monster part turned into the church scene from kingsman
It’s another Stereotype video  That’s what I’m talking about.  Also after so long, The Rage Monster has been overtaken.
You guys turned the rage monster scene into an Adam Sandler movie
Great bro 's!!
I just had a wedding
Loved the video 👍👍👍
Love the content keep it up
Legit I’m going to a wedding later today.
Finally, Ty doesn’t rage on Cody. Love the two rage monsters too!
Noooooooo… the cake 😢
poggers
🇰🇿❤️
The RAGE MONSTER never gets OLD!!!!
Y’all forgot the double wedding
Bruh I asked for this on my old account like 5 years ago 😂😂💀
My family is way behind on y’all’s videos 😭
holy moly, 300k views in only 57 minutes
Whooooooo DP!
When is the rocket video from rocket battle 3
I loved the prank bros with the remote control farts. 😁
The rage monster OG 💪 and the bride zila 🔥🔥
Bruh a dance circle 💀💀
Alexa Bliss?
Alexa Bliss???
Never thought I’ll see the day when the rage monster was stopped
This is the most personality Alexa has shown since she came back to WWE
The Dance Circle latterly  happened to me at my cousins wedding 😅
Only thing a want to say is: "I Love You Alexa Bliss" 💕
I loved the Never Ending veil! And the rage monster was great! I REALLY want to see Hotel stereotypes as the next one! Great work Dudes!
Was that Alexa bliss?
“Congarts on the Wedding!”
BTW is that Alexa Bliss
The only time Ty got defeated for real
Fire video 10/10 🔥🔥🔥
Alexa!!! Bridezilla😂
The only time Ty got defeated for real
The stereotype music brings back memories 🥲
Dude perfect should do trick shots with Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen  and head coach Sean mcdermott or Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick mahomes and head coach Andy Reid
1 hour late
Alexa Bliss ❤
This isn’t even funny, it’s way to over exaggerated
Well done
Is that Alexa Bliss????
We are always delighted when the Rage Monster arrives, but the Bridezilla? That was unexpected.
Alexa Bliss ❤
Who here here can tie a tie without watching a video on how to tie a tie?       Cuz I can’t 😂
Do school stereotypes please!
Wow, the Bridezilla was really well done... she reminds me of someone, though :)
Absolutely perfect timing with being at my brothers wedding today! Great video Dude Perfect!
High budget cool video  Appreciate the effort . Love from India .
Dude perfect is dying and I’m all up for it
Nobody: Dude perfect still in their prime
In my life of dude perfect stereotypes no one has ever defeated rage monster until now
The blonde - pink hair bride really did her role perfectly as the bridezilla 😂 Who is she?  P.S I'm new to dude perfect 5:24 best
Last time was new parents now wedding the next lovers
4:56 YO IS THAT ALEXA BLISS??

THAT WAS AMAZING
1:58 That transition from edm to the usual bg music is sooo on point👌👌👌

I’ve never expected another rage monster to encounter another at the same time and Ty get defeated
Dance Circle
Ayyyy🎉
I was waiting for “the objector.”
Yea!!!!!
Is nobody gonna talk about Alexa Bliss being in this??
This was literally the best one yet!!! The Friends one was just a big surprise and amazing addition to the video!! How about you guys do a Stereotype video on School or any sport like Darts or Bowling?? Just some suggestions from the top of my head!!! Love what you guys do. Love you all!!!
Alexa Bliss using her WWE talent is Hilariousss 😂 ❤

Bridezilla was great best stereotypes yet

This was really funny and seeing Alexa bliss in the video and some references to WWE was really amazing
Was that Alexa bliss
AMAZING!
The effort 👍
Tys weird analogy part actually helped me out. It is easy to bring someone down wish I heard this 12 years ago
*Bridezilla appeared* The Rage Monster: "Finally, a worthy opponent!"
Mike Grundy reference for the win!
Use this as a school stereotypes button
my cousin is getting married today, coincidence…?
Hey dude perfect can you doschool stereotypes
Finally, the rage monster has been defeated
I've been on YouTube for 10 years and this is the first time dude perfect video was recommended to me
Alexa bliss! 💖
Please release How to tie a tie with Ty in full.
4:57 Is that Alexa Bliss??
Lol the Pete Weber reference. “Who do you think you are, I am!” Absolutely perfect…
4:41 What is Alexa Bliss doing in there??
my fav is ty's rage monster
the girl is crazy
Alexa Bliss is in this!
I love this series! Athletes parents stereotypes next?
Alexa Bliss just added to it lol
Next school stereotypes
It’s finally here!!!!!!
"Emily,Rachel" nod to American show Friends😁
That rage monster never gets old 😂
Alexa bliss?
Gotta love Alexa Bliss laying out TT THROUGH THE CAKE
I would literally sell my kidney to go to a Bridezilla wedding.
In the Beginning this Video was amazing but halfway through it You guys went To Far this video went steady to Over Board I was happy and now I'm sad? I miss the old Dude perfect's Video's when they weren't cheesy 😢
Claim your early ticket here
TUD
The rage monster Wifezilla and the best man speech are the three best along with all the other ones
How about a dude perfect stereotypes?
Finally someone who can stop the rage monster 😂😂
the rap wasn't even that bad
You should do family dinner stereotypes
We need a hockey stereotypes!!! ASAP
I love the mike gundy quote from the rage monster😂
Maybe we're not meant to be together... Yeah but we already mixed quesos 😂
the rage monster when out of hand or it because he knock down 3 people
perfection
I thought the worst man one where the guy lost the ring was a reference to Joey but I didn’t think anything of it.  Then the person being really annoying trying to organise the wedding like Monica with the Bride (Phoebe) snapping and then the I take the Rachel
5:45 who else remembered charlie when ty said this
It’s gunna be a sad day when Dude Perfect runs out of ideas for stereotypes videos 😢
The girl at the bridezilla is that Alexa bliss from wwe 🤣
This is easily the best stereotype video use have made
The friends reference was perfect 😂 well done guys!
BrideZilla Vs The Rage The Best Battle Ever!
Ok than
Yo Alexa Bliss Is There Btw Nc Content!!!
I laughed so hard 😂😂😂
Well done😂😂👏
STEREOTYPES!! WOOOOOO I would definitely be tie noob. I still don’t get the advanced technology   Day 32 of asking for School Stereotypes
I’m not going to lie that was kinda disappointing
Yes it’s back stereotypes
Alexa Bliss? ok... i like it😂
Is that WWE superstar Alexa bless
Alexa blissss is in a dude perfect video
Still nothing changes with rage monster. *Bridezilla steps in* The Rage Monster: ah s*it
Range monster 😂😂😂😂
Alexa bliss?
When I was at a wedding I shed tears
I love your videos.
im the dude with the camera getting hyped at everyone fighting
Pink tie loser got me there
Alexa bliss much ❤️
Gotta love the friends reference in there
Bridezilla's rampage was justified
Rage monster has actually been beaten
Can’t believe they managed to get Alexa bliss in this!
That’s my sister’s wedding sorted 🤣
As a wedding videographer they wedding video one is a personal attack 😂😂
I think these all happen in every single wedding ever made (especially the one I went to)
Yes finally
No stereotypes video is truly complete without the rage monster 😂
The only thing I feel really sorry about is the broken guitar...
Never thought I’d see Alexa Bliss (Alexis Cabrera) in a DP video. 😂
Hold on Alexa bliss ?
Bro is that Alexa Bliss?
Is that Alexa Bliss???!!
German viewers 🤔
1:49 those are sick moves!🔥😅 Btw i never expected wwe superstar cameo🤣
Hahhahahahaha
I'm just gonna be the one to say it:  I loved that Lexi Kaufmann (WWE Superstar Alexa Bliss) was in this video 😎🤘🏼
The tie thing always happens with me. I had a cultural programme where I got a neck ache tying a tie, be it a fest or any event. Gotta confess, I'm a tie noob and it's okay to be one. :)  Also, I don't have a Ty who'd help me with my tie to tie it.
Haha “and the bride has entered the chat”
Bridezilla was my fav
I love the Stereotype videos! Some I can relate some I can’t but I enjoy them all!
yo is that Alexa Bliss???
“Who do you think you are I am?!”
wow absolutely loved it....................
Lol
*STOP SCROLLING BRUH*  Commenters I have a question if anyone can answer.  How do I have 2 names? On Display it's RollyAV but inside its HoneyCreeper.  If your mind is blown🤯, Consider Subscribing or just leave a like on this comment. I'm going through hard time.
4:53 is that Alexa bliss?
Can't believe they got married to shoot this video
You can never go wrong with a DP stereotypes video,I’m not any of them since I haven’t been to a wedding yet, I feel like the bad kisser should have been in the vid
Where are the drunks 😅
Yo, is that Alexa Bliss
never expected the friends reference 🤣🤣🤣
Gotta love bridezilla!😂😂😂
The rage monster was stopped? Kinda
Sub 1hr!!!!
THE BRIDEZILLA!!!!!!
Missed opportunity, every wedding has that one guy watching sports on his phone.
B R I D E Z I L L A
Funny vids
Better than the Try Guys lol
I never once imagined that the “Rage Monster” would ever get dropped🗿
"the bride has entered the chat" - Cody 2022
You know the funny thing is I have a wedding today
Best counter to the Rage Monster...Alexa Bliss as Bridezilla!!!
im going to a wedding this afternoon hope it ends well
you trick shots are fake
Wait, is that Alexa bliss????
Just started watching but I’m really hoping there’s a change up and the bride is the rage monster
I think I recognize this venue. My best friend got married here.

I’m a man! I’m 40!— great reference
Where is the messed up car?
Hoping they couldn’t see up her dress at the end 😳 💀
lol
Hi
The rage monster part is getting old now …
Bridezilla reminds me of the main character from the movie Ready or not aka the most badass lady ever!
Sparky’s partner looks absolutely gorgeous
the tie stereotype was the most accurate
This is super fresh
yeah baby
5:42 Whoa dude! You didn't even slap him yet! 😂
6:04 The rage monster
Hi ❤
the panda should have been the dj
I didn't not expect Alexa Bliss to be in a DP video. Awesome crossover 👏 and Alexa looks really beautiful 😍
The tie noob is so me😭😭😂😂
wkwkwk... wedding crazy this😂😂
The objector becoming the Rage Monster is one thing, but having the "Bridezilla" coming in and continue the havoc? Man, that sure is a way to ruin a wedding!
Is she alixa bliss... 🤨🤨
is that Alexa Bless?
"take thee Rachel"
Less goo they made a FRIENDS reference
Bridezilla enters the chat .. Everyone to Rage monster : I dont want to play with you anymore..
DP AND ALEXA BLISS 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩

Alexa Bliss was such a shocking and unneeded addition, and I loved it😂😂
This is soooo cool
This might be the best Rage Monster/Bridezilla bit ever!!!
Bruh wedding is such a big deal that I can't get married
Love the friends reference 😂😂😂
6:03 THE RAGE MONSTER 😡  6:49 THE RAGE BRIDEZILLA 😡
One Bride look like Alexa bliss
they definitely stepped up!
The bridezilla out-raging the rage monster is the best part of this video, it was amazing, keep it up guys.
I’m going to a wedding today. This’ll really help. Thanks Dudes!

I love the friends reference in the worse case senerio one! Made me laugh 😂
Finally you uploaded

Love the friend’s reference at 8:45😂
I'm Emotional Breakdown for sure I was invited to my girlfriend's cousins wedding a few years ago and had a absolute breakdown when the bride and groom sealed their vows with a kiss and I didn't even know them
im terning 11
I'm disappointed in you, you had a floss
Star Wars reference! (2:14)
The fact that i just got home after my best friend's wedding is a coincidence
Of course they would get Alexa bliss or known in real life as Alexis Kaufman to be the only person to match the rage monster in sheer power lol 😂☠️
Alexa bliss!!
my bithday is today
Hi
I was not expecting bridezilla 😂😮😂😮
Hi
THE PETE WEBER REFERENCE YEEEESSSSSSSSSS😂😂😂💪🏾
I literally attended a wedding last night.  Hilarious timing.  Shout-out to that Mike Gundy reference  They forgot the glass tapper... Who wants the kiss signaled!
Alexa bliss did great
Friends reference was on point
The friends reference was spot on
2:28 that’s just the best part!!!
Ironic I’m currently in Murphys Ca for a wedding.
Me not having a wedding today
Who is the bridezilla girl?
Yeah dream wedding the bride is alexa bliss🔥🔥🔥
“Maybe we’re not meant to be together?” “Ya, but we already mixed queso’s” 🤣
When my brother got married I cried for ten minutes after the service 😅defo the first one
your videos come at the right moment every time, when I was getting bored and was about to start overthinking
Hold up, ALEXA BLISS IS IN THIS VIDEO?  That was so unexpected, I love it!
Me is early

Never lock your knees😂
Cody looks so much taller than Tim.😄😄
The fact that Alexa bliss appeared on the video was awesome
Finally another stereotypes video
Weddings 🤵🏻👰🏻‍♀️
TOMORROW IS MY FRIENDS WEDDING, YOY CANT MAKE THIS UP
Sleepover stereotypes please!!!!
It's always the little details. I haven't even seen the whole vid yet but I had to pause and comment. At 55 seconds the woman in the middle spits water subtly out the side of her mouth. Brilliant, hilarious work as usual everyone.
When this video is published a few hours before my bro’s wedding!
Dang we got a boy AND girl rage monster in this one! That was awesome.
8:49 nice FRIENDS reference 😂
Is that Alexa Bliss!?!?😂😂
The friends reference was epic 😂😂
This one is the best and the funniest dp stereotypes video ever
When the OT

43 min late
Friends reference lol
Hi
no way they just used that quote from mike gundy 💀
Is it me or did I see Alexa Bliss in that?
Why is a female wrestler named Alexa bliss in this
It’s certainly been wedding season for me. 6 wedding this summer, was in 4 of them, and another this fall. And I have experienced every stereotype in this video on a personal level
Nice
Is that Alexa Bliss as a bride?
ayyyo friends reference
SO nobody gonna talk about Alexa Bliss?
4:53 5:16 5:26 is that Alexa Bliss???

I think it’s safe to say that we all just watch these for the rage monster
Next do Thanksgiving Stereotypes
So cool to see Alexa bliss in this video I wasn’t expecting that!!
why is alexa bliss in this 💀😂
When did trevor Philipps start planning weddings?
It’s weird that there’s two rage monsters and it’s not Cody that makes Ty angry
Alexa Bliss?????

0:54 lol.
Finally, someone tamed the rage monster. Go bridezilla! She absolutely made my day. 😂😂😂

plz do a school stereotype
Bridezilla Vs Rage Monster — instant classic
10/10
Bridezilla on point

The Rage Monster has finally met his match!  Don’t mess with Bridezilla!
What about fall weddings With college football
Always wondering when and where the rage monster will come in but I'm never disappointed when he does😂
8:50 nice friends reference
What a great Mike Gundy Reference IM A MAN IM 40
I love the stereotypes keep up the great content

“I’m a man! I’m 40!”
The Rage Monster never gets old🔥🔥
rage monster defeated how
Yoo this came out the day I’m going to a wedding
Congarts on the video, bros!
Waited a long time for stereotypes ❤️
At 4:44 and 5:21 Did anyone notice that that was Alexa Bliss from WWE
Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
I always freak out when a new stereotypes video comes out
This was amazing as always DP!!!
The rage monster never gets old
This never disappoints. The suit struggles and the prank bros are up there.
My kids are losing their minds that you got Alexa Bliss in one of your vids. Well done!
6:48 the bridezilla joins a battle
The only reason I love these stereotypes video is because of Ty, aka the Rage Monster. :D
This is the best!
Coolest stereotype I've ever seen
Bridezilla honestly stole the show a bit for me there. Cody with the commentary. Coby with the hyped up dialog. Incredible scene!
ALEXAS BLISS 😮😮😮😮🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
"Get moving, or I'm gonna stuff those flowers in your mouth!" Best line in the whole video.
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? I AM!
I’m literally going to a wedding today. I’m one of the ensemble musicians… During the rehearsal yesterday, both the bride and the groom forgot to bring their vows and the rings…
This was weddingly perfect
I literally went to a wedding last night 😂
Why they talking shi about her hair it looks fine🤣
w

How did they get a WWE superstar in a video??? 5:17 that’s  Alexa bless
XD FRIENDS PARADY  MY DREAM
I wonder if one of the DP crew was actually getting married, and they just had to show all the suits, and decorations, and things to use as a tax write off.
ARE WE GONNA NOT REALIZE THAT IT IS ALEXA BLISS AT 4:53
I can’t tell but I swear that’s Alexa bliss
Ooooh That’s how they did the rage monster 😂
Finally! Someone stopped the rage monster😂😂
❤❤❤
6:50 The Future of The Rage Monster? Rage Monster Female? Probably

We love you rage monster!
Am I the only one who found it satisfying when someone finally stood up to Ty the Rage Monster Obviously I love Ty but I always felt like someone should stand up to him properly because he has caused so much misery to people and a few times it wasn’t that justified
Absolute banger 🔥
6:32 the livestream made me lose it!  hahahahaha
the ned fulmer 👀
Lol my cousins wedding was yesterday
Ty's haircut 💇‍♂️ tho
I was just at my cousin's wedding last night! Perfect timing.
I'm so glad this series is still around and could you guys do a hockey stereotype next
Why that one dude look like Jonny Dep🤣
Looks like the Rage Monster has met his match, also the Cotton twins just cheering during all the chaos 😂😂😂
115k in 26 minutes these guys are crazy
Alexa Bliss was😍😍
DIS IS HILARIOUS
Only people who didn’t come from tictok are worthy liking this 🏆
School stereotypes    👇
School stereotypes plss btw I'm 7 I'm using my dad's phone plssss don't telllll
never thought i would see a girl rage monster
Is that Alexa bliss as a “bride”?
Hopefully this wasn’t at a real wedding lol I know it wasn’t
I saw Cody at the state fair a few days ago. But he was with his wife and kids so I didn’t bug him. Hundreds of people around yet he blended in like a normal guy. Made me respect these guys a lot more 👍
Time for a FACE OFF of the Rage Monster vs Bridezilla
Another rage monster!!!!!!!!
Great video, but we need school stereotypes
i swear thats alexa bliss for wwe
Is that Alexa Bliss?
Bridzilla and the Rage Monster married together would be the best🤣
On my wedding I had the suit on for 30 minutes before I put on my boots my pants and work shirts 👕on the wife knew what I was going to do so she had use take pictures before the wedding and after lol
*The showoff KILLED it*
Didn’t expect the BRIDEZILLA 😂
we need elevator stereotypes
4:49 is that Alexa Bliss?!
Love your Chanel bro
Just had to see if there was an actual video called "how to tie a tie with TY". Feels like a missed opportunity
DEREKTORS_CUT: 'OW... that hurt. 😮'
Dude this might be one of the best stereotypes
Love this!🤣
Range monster stealing the show once again 🤣
My second cousin is getting married 10/22
"hey guys im TY and welcome to how to tie a tie by me, TY" 😂
Love your Chanebro
Okay brooo this is the most chaotic stereotypes ever and I love it 😂🤣🤣😂🤣
Rage monster is still my favorite stereotype to this day 😂
the stereotype: "worst case scenario" is actually taken from FRIENDS
They finally posted
The rage monster is my friend.😋
Didn't think someone would have been able to actually defeat the rage monster
IM THE OBJECTOR ALL DAY EVERY DAY
These stereotypes would never not make me smile 😄
Blowing up that death star cake really hurt as a star wars fan. 😢 It must have taken forever to make that.
That’s what happens to me every day
As a kid I never thought I’d like this
DP should do school stereotypes
Alexa Bliss was awesome 😅😅
I love the fact that they brought Alexa bliss lol that made it so much better😂💯🔥
Alexa bliss
Was that....Alexa Bliss?
July 18th's my birthday...

"Congrats to everyone who is early and found this comment"🏆
Such a banger episode

Finally streotypes video
ty as the “tie” tutorial person😂😂😂
Hear before 70m
After Months a new stereotypes has come and your Dude perfect stereotypes are the best.
I was best man for my brother two time but he told me lose weight I always been big because I played football but so I lost weight and my brother again it lol
We want more Stereotypes
Before I watch this: I wonder what's gonna happen with the rage monster
I felt attacked when Tie noob showed up. I struggle with Ties all the time 😅
Finnaly
My younger brother's wedding is in 4 hours and this was great for laughs right before then
wait, so ty can beat darth vader in a light saber dual but fails to beat a angry bride in hand to hand combat?
7:33 From How doyou Guys have a Monster Truck
Where did y’all get Alexa bliss
153,842 view🎉
Bridzilla was something new and amazing😂😂
Yay First 30 mins
8:35 , got me laughing.   "So I can reach the cinnamon toast crunch" 😭😭😭"that was one of the best things of my life" So does that mean the cinnamon toast crunch was the best thing?
I was hoping they’d flip the script and do a Bridezilla destroying the Rage Monster and they did not let me down

The rage monster and the bridezilla should get married
the emotional breakdown is a curse stereotype in the Philippines  because when the groom cry there is a chance that the man is cheating his wife (more than a year can trigger that)  xD
The combination of bridezilla and rage monsters is the best and that's a dream wedding 🤣🤣🤣
