Some people always have to learn the hard way to really appreciate a professional job done on anything.😁
I used your directions to do my daughter's hair last night. She is absolutely over the moon! 😊 it turned out really quite
Ive been thinking about this technique a lot lately, as im so tired of my hair. I have bettie page bangs, and typically like vintage cuts but dont trust anyone to know how to do proper midi style cuts. Ive always cut my own hair with a similar line to this cut, kind of a U-shaped or horseshoe cut, but now that it's long it has been difficult for me to give myself any layering with my neck mobility issues. I have fine hair, that is naturally wavy. I love to do vintage pincurl sets but it's been really hard to do them with no layering. Anyways, long story short, I trimmed my hair using this technique. I was conservative, but it made a huge difference in how healthy my hair feels already and I think it will work to give a more pinup pincurl ability and it worked great with my short, straight bangs. It worked with my bettie bangs! I'll see how it goes styling the next while, I may go a bit shorter to have more effect.  Thanks Brad Mondo for the tutorial!
4:08 😭😭😭😭😭😭
The risk is half the fun indeed 😂 I don’t have time to spend 3 hours at the salon, or money because some now have 3 price ranges according to hair length and 54 combinations of services to end up with a mid to bad haircut. I go from time to time and when i can't and my hair gets too long , i have fun 😂❤
I appreciate your intruction on the butterfly cut!  When i retired i just could not afford to go to the hairdressers all the time but still wanted it to look nice.  I'm not handy or crafty but I CAN DO THIS BETTER THAN MANY HAIRDRESSERS HAVE CUT MY HAIR!  If they would take pride in their craft and listen to what someone wants maybe i wouldn't have to do it myself!  I just stopoed at a walk in for a trim and she dry cut it, didn't even wet it down, cut 1/2" off all the way around and charged me $30!  It was uneven and didn't get my splits!  This is why i will continue doing it myself now!  It looks so nice when i do it myself! Thank you from the bottom of my heart for empowering me to do it myself!
could you seek out chad cheers I loved his stuff
I agree everyone needs layers.
On April G's part, what is the curling thing she is using?
Hey Mr Mondo, thankyou,  I'm 68! W/long thick hair feeling so heavy. You won't see a video from me But I really like how it layered & feels much nicer & lighter, thanks Hon😉
Brad I just tried your butterfly tutorial and I'm in love ❤ Thank you so much!!
@brad mondo  I am a middle aged grandmother with naturally cury hair. Woke up yesterday & decided I wanted to put layers in my heavy hair, so naturally,  I went to find YOU. I did the butterfly cut with a twist, I now wish I had made a video for you because it turned out amazing 👏  I put a ponytail inside of my ponytail on the back, I also added an extra one on back for extra layering. I am so super happy with it! My hair is so much lighter and bouncier! Thank you for all that you do for us!
You just know you help a lot of people who can’t afford it like single mothers who have 3 and 4 kids. To them , you’re a blessing! 🙏🏼❤
discovered you today 👍👍👍
I'm thinking about doing the butterfly hair cut on my hair and if it looks good I might do the cut on my daughter's hair her hair is thin in the back it will give the fuller and thicker look she is 15
Back in the '70s, I went to Barber College and the style was a layered cut.  Hard to do on your own, but the guide was in the center of the head.  Bangs were in, and everyone looked like Stevie Nicks.  Not too long ago, I tried to get that cut. The Stylist wrapped my hair around her shears??????? Looked like s***.
Ok The first girl, I can not believe she cut her hair 3 different times!! But it turned out great!!! 😊
The last 3 times I went to  hairdressers, they did not cut the way I wanted them to.  Each time, I let my hair grow a full year, so they could have enough hair to layer it the way I wanted.  One person 'forgot', one person cut off 7 inches instead of 3, etc.  I will do a better job myself, without  the $50-80 pricetag!  I can't screw it up any worse.  My motto:  do you want it done professionally, or do you want it done right?
Yo!! Oat milk will leech all your minerals out of your bones, and too much matcha can land you in the ER. Look it up… It’s a ceremonial drink, not a multi times a day drink. P.S. Every time I do my hair, I can’t help but hear your voice narrations. 😂❤
I love Jenna Phipps. Her house is coming along nicely.
Oh no, I’m doing this right now… I am so glad to say that it came out beautiful like a salon cut… thank you Brad😊
I can't afford a hair salon so I have to cut my own hair. Thank you for your help. ❤
I’ve been losing a lot of hair lately.  I definitely can tell a difference when I leave in hair conditioner ❤❤
Don't know WHY video showed on my feed. Is this cut good for natural curly hair too. Fun video BRAD.!!!
Guys I just gave myself a wolfcut 👁️🇪🇸👁️
Just curious, would this cut work for extra long hair (up to my backside) that hasnt been cut or coloured for over a decade?
Omg she’s not even put it up cleanly! Can’t watch anymore…
I literally can’t afford a Stylest any longer! Last haircut a year ago at Ulta was $62 before the great tip!! That’s almost $100 for a trim?!?!
I did it. Thanks a million, Brad.
You really helped a lot of people. Especially us older ones living on a farm, far away from the cities. Much love
Common! Hair grows back.😃
You made me laugh when you made a comment. L. I'm never laugh so much in my life like this. Keep up what you want ❤❤❤❤.
I'm ready love watching your videos keep doing it 😍💓🤩💘. Good good education.
Brad im a coametologist and I love you.  Thank you for reminding the leave more length curly.  You would cry if you had seen  how many "professionals" JACKED my hair.
🎉🎉🎉🎉
❤❤❤❤
Wow I think they did great.  Good job girls. 👍👍👍
but most people dont cut the back shorter enough, to really be like the one in your video tutorial, that butterfly one where the back part is really more full and the first layers of the strands of hair be a bit shorter, in the same lenghts of the front, creating almost like a sort of illusion of a chanel or short bob hair on the upper hair line.
Yuck
As someone who has sobbed after haircuts and who used to have the worst social anxiety your videos really helped me feel confident in my hair!   I think I've done this cut 5 or 6 times and love it always!
12:56 That’s what blew my mind, I cut literally over 5 inches off and my hair is still long like I wanted it😭
I’m so glad that you showed us how to do our own hair. I had no way to get to an actual hair dresser or stylist and I was in desperate need of getting rid of my dead/split ends and giving my curls some layers and thanks to you my hair is just so amazing now. I never would have thought it would be so easy. Thank you so much Brad!
Try almond milk Brad that may help u
“I love that I can make you guys feel like” — *chokes to death*
As far as the mad hairdresser, well maybe so many people would go to them if they actually paid attention to what you want and did that instead of just doing what they want and you leave disappointed. Nothing like having to pay for disappointment 😂. Learning to do and cut my own layers has been a game changer for my hair life. No more getting something entirely different than what I asked for.
i just cut my hair and it looks fabulous 🤩🤩🤩🤩 ILYY❤❤
Can I cut off length as well? I want to cut my tailbone length hair to above my shoulders, about 13 inches. Or should I cut length first?
Lol, as a hair stylist of over 20 years.  I love you ❤❤.  Haters just jealous 😂 love your vids. 💇‍♀️❤
Thank you So So much. I lost my husband of nearly 40 years together last year this month ( May 2024 ) and I have not by my own choice; wanted to go to the hair salon and sit there trying to act all normal and chat or talk about the loss of my loved one. So  I am in my mid sixties and I say to you F$*#k them. Also , my gorgeous brother who was a hair stylist passed away in the early nineties ( due to an unfaithful partner of whom had AIDS ) At the time, most people wouldn’t even talk about it. So unfortunate that a lot of people can be just blinded and ignorant, so as I mentioned earlier; screw what anyone says about the wonderful help you are sharing to people like myself that really appreciate what you are doing. Also, hello to all my fellow Australian friends watching what this beautiful person is doing for us.😍❤❤❤
Some people just do NOT have the money for a haircut (me) and I have always struggled getting stylists to understand. THIS is the style I've always wanted! Doing it myself, sorry -not-sorry.
Use soy milk
Dont blame brad! blame the lock downs. Thats when i taught myself to cut and colour my hair...
Brad i did this cut today at home and cut off like 5 inches of my hair it looks great! I'm so grateful for your knowledge and expertise! Its been over 3 years since I got my hair done and being able to do it at home and it come out the right way and look properly cut is so relieving. ❤
I feel like a lot of hairdressers should be happy because the number of corrective jobs they probably get from these at home fails is probably A LOT.
We're going to do our own hair anyway because some of us can't afford to go to the salon. You might as well help us mess up our hair nicer than if we did it without direction 😂. Seriously though, thanks for the tutorials. I have learned so much!
I would love to see more ‘wins’ on your channel🥰
I love Jenna Phipps!!!!  Love it when my YouTubers get together.
I got my hair cut today and she didn’t layer it even tho I asked for layers so when I got home I grabbed kitchen scissors and layered/feathered bits of my hair
That was rude, I haven't done hair in too many years. It would be like starting over if I got back into it.
Collab with hair budhha!
I’m convinced 😂 gonna do it tomorrow:)))
I love this cut! I literally cut my hair 2 days ago. Took off about 3 inches off both ponytails. Feels so good and full of body! My curls are so bouncy! Thank you, Brad! ❤
This was FUN ...Y A Y!!!!
MISSED YOU.   ON TOO LONG !!¡ WLCOME BACK ❤
I went to the same hairdresser for 25 years with my mum, she died last May and ive not been back since as i cant bear to go without her. Your tutorials have saved me from looking like a depressed mop, even if i feel like one. So thank you for doing what you do 💕
the apple juice and matcha combo sounds weird but defo want to try!
We did this in the 1960’s, in several ways, most of us had very long hair - 😊 just saying…
I was going to cut my own hair anyway so why not give out a few tips? By the way I' KNOW what  Apex means. But thx.  I think I took off about 5 inches..
So I LOVE that you are selflessly teaching people how to do this AT HOME.  I was just about to do this cut - DRY - my hair is uber greasy because I've been letting my natural oils condition my hair for 2 weeks (sounds gross, but it's the best for MY hair) and I was all sectioned off perfect and about to CUT - when I literally heard the voice of GOD say STOP - WET your freaking hair!!  The voice of God sounded a lot like Brad's voice - but it felt like divine intervention - I'm running a bath, then cut, wish me luck! 🥰
Hi Brad, if I want to cut off length, should I cut off length prior or after?
I think what he does for tutorials is amazing! Some people are too broke to go to a professional salon for an overpriced haircut! I have been cutting my own hair for 5 years and watching Brad's videos for the same amount of time. I know that I'm not a professional, however every time I cut my own hair, it always turns out the way I want. So lay off the rest of the pros out there. Some of us are too broke and don't have enough time for your business. The last time I went to a professional, she BOTCHED the crap out of my hair!
I have a question so I have curly hair and I really want a butterfly haircut so Brad if you can help what will a butterfly haircut look on me:)
Not me gonna try it tomorrow at 4 am, and for it's like it's for my exam.. Yerp I loved the video tutorials I've watched.
Ive done it twice since you 1st posted it. Only I have really wavy frizzy hair that needs products. This cut helps a lot.
You always pass on the most awkward faces people make 😂
What kind of heat tool did April G use? It looked like a flat iron. I couldn't see any hair wrapped around it but when she let go it was a major curl.
You are not allergic to the oat, I don’t think, it’s just the additives. Same here. Look for oat milk with the smallest list of ingredients. And Good luck 😊.  Great videos, BTW.
Brad:hello beautiful 😍   :me(everytime): HELLO SEXY lol 😂  This man is amazing and a so nice to do these tutorials for us ladies and all the tips he gives us I love how he said f all u hairdresser haters lol😂.honestly I was feeling so depressed and doing his butterfly tutorial made me feel so good after it does help for your mental health ladies doing these makeovers but can’t wait to upload my video I did record it lol😂 😬 and I always wanted to be a hairdresser but never happened so I did feel like a hairdresser stylist now that I even be trying to help my man with him cutting his hair lol😂
You got to cut off a lot.... OH NO SHE IS CUTTING OFF A LOT I AM NERVOUS. I love your videos, I have been binging these and cut my own hair using the butterfly cut tutorial (it went well) but just leaving some love here and your energy is amazing
Nobody should be hassling you because you’re trying to help people do their hair the right way some people can’t even afford to go to the places to get their hair done so we appreciate all the help that you give us
What a sweetheart you are , and thank you for your support!
I really appreciate you doing this for us 😊❤
4:14 JESUS MENTIONED ✝️✝️✝️✝️🙏🙏🙏💝💝💝💝 brad i love ur vids!!
instead of OAT MILK, have MILK
Hairdressers h8 him ❤🔥
Do you recommend Aussie for the butterfly cut??
Awesome girl, really lovely cut.
You seem a bit wild on this video.
True, I for one don’t go to the hairdressers.I’ve learned some good tips from you.If people don’t follow instructions properly that’s their fault not yours.
Hairdressers are to expensive.  You got  to work 4 hours at minimum wage to get a styled haircut.
What fun. 🎉 I’m enjoying watching others do the Butterfly 🦋 cut an hour after cutting my own hair 💈 in the Butterfly cut ✂️. Solo happy with the outcome! 🎉🎉🎉 Thank you, Brad! 😘😘😘
Brad, my hair is just barely longer than shoulder length and VERY thick and barely wavy. Will it come out as nive as everyone else's hair did? I have cut my own hair before, but I cut it above my ears and then did random cuts to make it look textured. Strangely enough enough I got several compliments on it... But I want to keep most of my length this time. I once asked my then teenage boys about getting my hair shorter than yours and they made the mistake of telling me that if I cut it that short, I might as well shave my head. So I scared them by saying, "What a great idea!" No, I didn't shave my head, but I did go from waist length hair to extremely short (as in above my ears!) My boss came into my cubicle behind me and asked if I knew where her secretary was! 😂
What kind of curling brush do you recommend?
just a random question lol- is that a melanie hoodie brad is wearing?
Eeeeeeewwwww
It looks awesome!!
My hair is so thick and long and curly. I found it hard to get frame perfect. Maybe i didn't take enough Off the front. I will find out, it's,2:am . My hair is wet and in a bun. I some long layers. I am freaking out. My anxiety is through the roof. I will let you know, after i sleep. I am so nervous. But it's curly long. So maybe I won't see the mistake 🤞😊
I just did it, I am freaking out
I did it and it came great! You save 50 plus!
I did it and my hair turned out amazing thank you so much for your help ♥️
Love it! What if you have straight long hair, and don't want to style it? What if you just blow it out? I have long thin hair. Wouldn't it still look better, even if I don't curl it?
I did it too! I am very happy of the result. I love my hair 🤩❤️
I have curly hair and I now only do the butterfly cut.  I always get compliments and I always tell them it’s Brad Mondos butterfly cut.
Jenna Phipps is a DIYer through and through man. 😂 I love her so much.
Thank you ❤ my mom never wanted to pay for my things as a teenager she only took me to the salon like maybe 4 times so I started to cut my hair and bangs so happy to have peole teaching us , now i am 27 yrs old and i cut my hair way better and I feel good doing it , is like myself time ❤️
You can replace the oat milk with almond milk
You can replace the oat milk with almond milk
I don't think you're allergic to oatmilk. Wouldn't you have a gluten allergy then?
I have a phonia about getting my hair cut by people.  In the past 10 years, I've gotten about 4-5 hair cuts because of this. I've learned to take very good care of my long hair, but getting haircuts is still very necessary.  Your videos made a huge difference for me, and it turns out great when i do it bi-monthly now.
Omg…I have a concussion, Ugh! Hairdresser for 25 years and can’t figure out how to do anything with balance! Your tutorial took me longer…however, gorgeous hair with bounce! I Love it Thank You so much!❤ 2:01 I’d love to send pics if you’d like them
I’m on it!
14:50 I have curly hair and did this cut a few weeks ago. 🙃 I took off 6 or 7 inches but when I let my hair dry and it curled after it was at least a foot shorter. I expected it and just wanted to get my hair healthier to grow out but I'm sure it catches some by surprise. If someone with curly hair didn't have layers previously I think that could make it seem a bit more drastic as well, so maybe try cutting off a bit less than you were thinking and style it and see how you like it if you're particularly worried. You can always cut more later :)
I have damaged my hair from a bad bleach job (I have learned my lesson, I’m better when bleaching/dying my hair). I needed to trim off the dead/uneven ends, but wanted to keep some of the length I fought to get back. I did watch your tutorial and decided to gave it a try. Now I did hear you say multiple times in multiple videos that you need to cut a lot to see a difference, but I cut roughly 3-4 off the front and 4-5 off the back. It turned out really good, layered look with my length in tact and no more dead/uneven ends. You made a tutorial that gave people confidence to take care of themselves, which is always a good thing.
Pink light and gayness is my happy place ☺️🩷❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🩷
❤Dude I love you
April! Don't ever ever ever do that again girlie!! I've been there
RICE MILK
I love watching your videos. You're so entertaining and I'm learning a lot. Thank you.
Could be a wheat allergy you have Brad
She just needed some nice layers
I would so much like to get my hair style in a butterfly cut. But I  afraid to do it myself. So i will take your video to my hair salon and will be asking them to do it exactly like you explain in your tutorial.
I just love you Brad!!
I just cut my hair with the ponytails method too and it looks great. I've been so depressed and this made me look like a human again
“I see lumps, I see bumps” - no ma’am, no hamm, no turkey 🤣🤣
Aww, I was hoping to see how her hair would look with her natural curls DX I have curly hair and tempted to do this! lol
6:30 Jenna! It's looking lovely 💕 8:53 omg that was intense... 😂
Almond milk
I've been doing this for 2 years. Wish I found it earlier. Saving a ton of money.
Love you Brad!! Ignore the haters
I’m a year late on this, but I will say: I started following Brad’s tutorials during the Panini because everywhere was closed. Then I did it when I was broken and couldn’t afford to get my hair done professionally. Now I’m not broke anymore, and I have a new and deep appreciation for what hairdressers do. And how difficult the work actually is. I tip hairdressers more now in part because of that appreciation.
I love getting tips and tricks when I just need a trim and nervous to do it myself. ❤ honestly I’ve made mistakes in the past so I love your vids to educate myself more ❤
We thank you, because my salon experiences have mostly been stylist that do not listen. Because they think they are so amazing that they can impose a haircut and length that, we the guests said do not do.  I am tired of it. Exhausting trying to find someone who listens and follows directions.  Currently growing out the worst mix matched hair cut I’ve ever had.  That rude arrogant girl is lucky I didn’t rip her hair out, she was seconds away from being permanently bald.  BTW, No only did I absolutely hate what she did, everyone I know had repeatedly reminded me of this traumatizing and violating experience. More tutorials please.
I got my hair cut by a hairdresser yesterday... he cut off 7 inches after agreeing on a trim. He hacked away at my hair with a razor and now it's half the thickness all thin and wispy. I showed he 4 pictures of the haircut I wanted he did the complete opposite... didn't even blowdry it like it. Piece of sh**. Now I have to cut it myself it cost me £40 waste of time and money. Ive been going through a lot and just wanted to feel better. I am never going to a hairdresser again. I feel sick and can't sleep.
So glad I found your channel! Salon hairdressers need to take a chill pill. They also gain. Imagine how many 'fixes' they have to do for the fails LOL! I LOVE that you're showing us what we can do at home. There are so many people who are lacking confidence, don't want to go out, don't feel 'cool'...so then we put off the haircuts - so - you're helping the cycle! By getting a home haircut right, that will bump up the confidence and then next time, they're in a better place to go to the salon! Nobody should be upset with anyone for sharing the fun and the love!! (You'd SOB if you saw my hair right now LOL! That's going to change because of your videos) I 'YouTubed' cutting a boy's hair for my son because every barber just scalped him every time and he hated it! I have more than paid for the clippers now and I have a happy boy who is getting what he wants! That builds his confidence! Win!  🤩🤩🤩
I literally just followed your butterfly haircut tutorial and I am very happy. Thank you for this. I'm a single mother and I can't afford to go to the hairdresser's, so your tutorial has been amazing! I have cut own hair in the past....quite a lot....but your Tutorial was the easiest one I've attempted, and it worked! Thank you ❤❤❤
Omg 🎉 i just did this too my daughter and i took like twenty minutes. And she had such long hair to her back but now its up to her waist area so its still real long and i cut like 5 inches off at least. And i can see layers but its a long layer and it looks great!!
2:36 U OK BOO? LIKE FR.
As someone with really curly hair...my whole entire life I've asked for a cut to look like this, shown pictures, etc. Nobody would get it right. "I know what you want, you want a Rachel cut!" No, I don't. "Trust me, I'm a professional." Over the years I got sick and tired of paying and tipping out of politeness for shit haircuts I didn't ask for. Then I became a mom with daughters that have my hair. This cut was a game changer. Between me cutting all of our hair, waxing eyebrows, and being able to color hair, I've saved thousands over the past 6 or so years. So if hair stylists are mad, they can just be mad. If we could ever have found one that listened and knew how to cut hair we wouldn't have resorted to doing it ourselves.
The beginning with Jenna was so funny. I love her.
Thank you for all your videos on these tutorials… I have 4 kids , one with severe health issues, raising my grandson and I barely make it in every 6 months to get my hair done . This has saved me for when my hair looks 😩 and it also saves me 💰 thank you ❤
I love layers
OMG Some people need to seriously CHILL! 😂 Brad hasn’t once said he “invented the Butterfly Cut”. If you actually watched his videos, you’d hear him say things like “I love that this cut has come back into fashion” and “I do want to know why they called it the Butterfly Cut - they should’ve called it the Unicorn Cut or something, because of how the hair is pulled to the front”. Please actually LISTEN to someone properly before making rude or plain ridiculous comments… He said (because you clearly don’t listen) that he’s copping hate from hair stylists because he uploaded a tutorial on how to do it, and everyone is following that tutorial and then writing his name in the title of their video - which he found when he searched “what is happening with the Butterfly Cut these days”. He’s not taking credit for “inventing” the cut - he’s rightfully taking the credit for people cutting their hair into this style, without completing ruining their hair BECAUSE they followed the steps in his tutorial. So can you just STOP? Stop ruining a lovely and supportive comment section. It’s people like you, who go out of their way to p!ss on someone’s parade, which make wonderful people like Brad question why they bother trying to help people with tutorials or reaction videos. His videos not only help people with hundreds of hair styling tips and tutorials; they help people like me with mental health problems actually laugh or smile for the first time that day if I can’t get out of bed. He doesn’t HAVE to take the time & effort that he does on each video, so please think of others who love his videos, and stop ruining his view of the rest of us with your petty little comments. You don’t look good trying to make him look bad, so please have some respect and be nice or just be quiet.
I think visiting a salon is also risky some times xD Last time the hairdresser hurt me and the cut was uneven... then I tried your tutorial and it came out perfectly!!
Does it work on short hair too?! 🫣🫣
3:49 why does she look like fleur from harry potter’s 😮😅 4:06
Very helpful. Before I try it myself, any helpful hints for doing the butterfly cut if you usually  part your hair on the side (different ponytail placement, etc)?
Seriously, I‘ve been avoiding hairdressers for years cause they always messed up my hair and even thought I can’t have layers cause my hair just got super thin. Tried your tutorial and what can I say, this is the best cut I’ve EVER had. If hairdressers get mad, maybe they need to to better work
Jenna Phipps looks like Hunter Schafer😮
Imagine having chronic nausea issues and being allergic to ginger - a natural anti nausea solution 😂 IDK what I did in my past life but damn 😂 couldn't help but comment on the oat milk allergy, no hate, that sucks! haha
You are the best thank youso much.I follow your tips on this beautiful cut 🦋 I did my own hair and it came out amazingly beautiful.  I watch your YouTube channel and made my purchases on these amazing products ( electric rain, glitterati, wavetech extra hold foam, viper, heat protectant  and salty sea salt. My hair is on point flawless products smell so good❤ I enjoy your videos so much. Your funny in a great way also cute😍  Keep these videos coming❤👏👍🥰
I did it and it actually turned out pretty damn good lol
Can I do a butterfly haircut if I have bangs?
I tried today 😁🤘🏻
rhyme surprise with demise haha i literally watch your videos for your energy not even haircuts ahha
I wanna do this cut or the wolf cut, but my mom said no :(
I have agoraphobia and haven't had my hair properly cut since before covid, and following your tutorial allowed me to finally cut it, and it feels (and looks) so much better. Thank you.
I'm conflicted...butterfly or wolf? 🤔
Me watching this bc i just did this exact cut
Honestly I’m glad you’re making these videos helping us do our own hair cause too many hair dressers fucked our shit up and we fed up 😂
I tried this the other day and I was too scared to take off a lot. I have shoulder length hair. 😅  I went to get my hair cut at a salon and got what looks like a cub cut and I love it! I just wanna say, I think it’s really interesting how people of different races cut hair. It makes sense tho, since we all have very different hair types.   If you have curly hair, then you may wanna go see a colored lady. They do it different and it’s amazing. You have to cut curls a bit differently and they seem to really know what the curls need.   At least, that’s what my stylist said. Just a few times 😂
I just did a butterfly cut on myself. Was it 100% perfect? No, but it was so close esp. since I do not have the $$ to spend on my hair at this time. Sadly, others try to stop the teaching when that is one of the best things about Youtube.  Keep up the great work and thank you.
After I saw this video, I’m gonna find the video the tutorial and show it to my mom and make her do my hair Because I am risking cutting my hair and I think I’ll give me more volume because I really really really thin hair
I followed your tutorial a week ago and I am in love with the results! It was a great step by step and I was able to replicate the cut easily 🥰
I always come back to this video: i know there are some hairdressers having some opinions on brad but i gotta say its so freeing cutting your hair alone at home, since i deal with hair loss i hate  someone touching, cutting and most importantly brushing my hair vigorously while it flies off my head and doing it my way gives me less anxiety losing so much hair at the hairdresser... so thx brad ❤
Try cowmilk😂 or Matcha tea😊
Does the butterfly automatically give you the curtain bangs. Or do you have to cut them in
You did greatby empowering so many and your success that followed is an affirmation to that. THANK YOU BRAD!!!!❤
Which curler did the second girl use?
Brad Mondo, you are so cute!
I'm have glasses and I'm practically blind without them, so many times I've gone to a salon and had to just have completely faith only for them to mess it up. I have some real horror stories so personally thanks for giving us our autonomy back.
I have to thank you!!! My hair looks great, it helped me get rid of my split ends. It makes me feel really cute 😁  Also, gonna cut my mom’s hair since she broke both her legs and is wheelchair bound and there are no accesible salons near us
JENNNANA PHHIIPSPSPSPSPPS
It might not be the actual oat milk, it might be what’s in it like the extra ingredients. My youngest child is allergic to oat milk, but she’s not allergic to oatmeal.
I used this method after getting frustrated with trying to afford going back to my salon. After watching a multitude of these videos then going back to Brad’s I felt ready. I’m in love! It came out better than the trim I had gotten last time at the salon and I have thick hair. The cut works so well with my hair texture. It waves perfectly allowing me to leave it curly or blow it out straight. Absolutely love it!
Brad Mondo saved my life. And my bank account.
I thought I saw Jenna, I clicked, I’ve never been happier
Im so glad brad can't see how i cut my hair bc it was ratchid. I followed tutorial tho and it turned out great!❤
Yes! Fine hair butterfly cut videos!!! Doing it! Gotta dye my hair again first. Looking for videos about your dyes. I love a pink/salmon to purple on my face.
Thank you for helping us poor people who can't afford trying hairdressers who only ruin our hair, then i go home and have to fix my $100+ cut plus tip. 🤦 I'm blind, so i would prefer to find a good stylist, but they just can't cut fine, thin, straight, long-to-medium hair
I tried the butterfly cut last year, i didnt like it that much bevause it madr my hair look too thick and puffy but last night I followed your layering video that  you sectioned in four sections and i also did the optional thinning and omg! It looks professional! Thank you!
People are busy and broke af these days. While I know it’s their job so of course they’re losing revenue and gonna be pissed about it, I also can’t say I have ever been to a salon and don’t plan on it. I trim my own hair, and have a hair care routine that keeps my locks healthy and looking good enough, so no, I’m not gonna spend $100 for a trim to get rid of split ends, or spend 3+ hours and like $300 getting my hair dyed.  I do not have that free time or that amount of spare money just lying around. I’d rather spend a couple hundred on quality hair products and pamper myself in the comfort of my own home.
John Sahag may have been the one who started the trend in the late'70s. Loved it when I tried it out when I was seventeen. Later on I wacked the top of my hair to give a punk Joan Jett look before she got popular 😎🤣
Can it be done with like 4b hair? I want some more layers in my curls but always v. Apprehensive cause if it looks bad it takes forever to grow out!
You da best xD saved many of us 50$$$
They can stay mad lol sorry I can't afford $100 for a HAIRCUT
I absolutely love this guy! I had rather have a man cutting my hair bc they're GREAT and NO FEMALE WANTS YOU GOING OUT THE DOOR LOOKING BETTER THAN THEMSELVES.  I totally wish you worked close by! 🔥❤️💯
I'm 42 years old I think maaaaybe twice in my life I have been to the hairdressers and been thrilled with the result. My hair is incredibly thick and I feel like most hairdressers don't know how to deal with it. So I'd rather DIY and if I do mess up at least I haven't spent £££s on something I'm not happy with. So thank you Brad for sharing your knowledge 👍
12:11 bro was rethinking his whole life  It ain't easy to be a hairdresser
The wet hair cutting is a fantastic tip. I will never cut my hair dry again.
Thank you so much, my hair looks great.
I LOVE your videos, but can you pls stop saying "oh my god"? Cause it's a sin?.. but if you don't want to it's okay, but just to let you know. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE YOUR VIDEOS❤ ty for reading this
Oh my love 'fills you with pink light and gayness' this is the best and made my chuckle 😘
So I've gone through 3 hairdressers in my life (I'm 35 and started getting my hair cut at a salon at 4yrs old) because I have touch aversion and find it difficult to get comfortable with people, it is near impossible for me to find one... Unfortunately 2 retired and the 3rd is semi retired and her availability doesn't mesh with mine... So I've used videos like yours to do my own. Hairdressers who get mad aren't taking into account people who just have a hard time going to salons for a multitude of reasons.
I cannot go to the hairdresser's right now. I have a 2 year old and a 4 month old. No way I can sit in  a chair peacefully for even 30 minutes. So I am going to try the butterfly cut soon. This long postpartum hair is weighing me down so bad.
I love you! Haha! Fuck the haters! Bahahahaha!
Just did this and it turned out great 🎉
I just tried doing the butterfly cut on my DRY CURLY hair. I am so mad I did not video this bc WOW!!!!  My hair went from eh to va-va-voom!!!!!!!!
You are such a joy to watch! Wonderful personality!
@BradMondo you've literally given me the courage to give myself your butterfly 🦋 cut.  I'm leaving this message b4 going to buy the right scissors & some hair ties so I'm not using Scrunchies.  I'm excited to try this as soon as I get back w/the right scissors ✂️   Wish me luck! 🤞😘
To finish his rap...  "Isn't that nice?"
Brad with he's butterfly jumper , theme on point 🦋
I gave myself a butterfly cut couple days ago AND IT TURNED OUT FABULOUS! thank you Brad Mondo!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
So sorry you get alot of hate for helping us all out, I have autistic kids that won't go to the hairdressers so you help so many people so much, the people that CANT go to the hairdressers ❤ xx
7:04 oatmeal strips the body of minerals and isn’t healthy, it’s popper food like originally popular so people wouldn’t starve but not actually good for us or healthy like marketed
does this also look good if i wanna wear my hair side parted and not middle parted after?
In singapore where I come from, haircut at neighborhood areas can be as cheap as $10 or less. There’s less incentive to cut our own hair.
This video was so much fun 😍
9:06 she nailed it !!
Oatmilk? Could it be gluten related?
I love u
Are u gay or straight cause u don’t have a girlfriend
Me leaning over the bathroom sink pausing this video to make sure I don't chop all my hair off.
i have pin straight hair but im dyign to try this haircut (at home) usually it looks really good w girls w at least wavy hair so I'm not sureeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee i need suggestions plss
I loveee doing this cut to my hair. I just cant afford an expensive trim appointment anymore. I do this to refresh my ends every couple months. Then when i want the professional dramatic look, i will book my girl. So thank you Brad!!! ❤
@bradmondo I just cut my hair using the Butterfly cut (after the basic haircut video, I wanted more layers) and I took off 14" of hair (I could sit on my hair😂😂) Thank you for great tutorials, please keep these uploaded and make MORE! ❤❤❤
Hey Brad, can you do a butterfly on chin length to shoulder length hair?
Take a benadryl and go to a dr and get an epi pen may need to get tested and see what all you're allergic to
I'm speechless..simply beautiful!
I used to take Oat milk and Almond milk but because of the sodium in both I use now coconut milk...and that seems best for now so u can try it Brad
I used your tutorial to cut my daughters hair and she loved it.  Thank you very much.
I did this after many years of never daring to do anything to my hair. And I love it. I had spent so much on my last haircut and the stylist barely touched my hair. Since she styled it, I wasn't sure. But when I washed it, I knew the style was still boring. So I cut it and I liked it. 😅😂 now I have to find a new stylist cause the stylist will freak when she sees the cut and I don't wanna deal with it haa😅😅
I did mine today, and my hair turned out really nice. ❤
Tjank you for the tutorial. I cut my hair before a concert last night. I think i need more off the back. Now, about the oat milk. You might want to see if you have a gluten allergy (celiac). Oats often gave cross contamination with wheat.
hiii can u do a tut or like pretty haircuts with curly/afro hair plss
I tried the butterfly cut with some curtain bangs and i think i kinda like it. I wanna cut more hair but my friends are gonna kill me if they see me in a short hair agian 😂😂😂
Everyone knows getting a new cut/ color makes you feel better. Lifts you up when even every other aspect of your life is in shambles. Many of us can’t justify spending the money it costs to have our hair professionally done, and aside from that it can be really fun to diy, so thank you.
Look you either love going to the salon or you don't my bangs need cutting every 2 weeks I would NEVER go that often. I don't even like being touched so it's horrible fo me getting in that chair so thanks ❤ you.
I fucking love you Brad. You made me look like a. Certified bad BITCH
Thank you for theses do and don't videos! 👏👏😀 I can not afford to get my hair done professionally, not with the cost of living right now! Especially to be disappointed or having to fix "their" mess up when I get back home! I can do bad all by myself, but I sure do love watching Brad, he is so Cute! 😍
I use Henna with lemon juice and tea. Colours all greys and is multi tonal. I cut my own hair. I spend approx £3.50 a month on hair care 😂
Thanks man, I just cut my wife’s hair, following your tutorial, it’s simple and beautiful, her reaction was priceless!
Glad I found you I have been scared to do it cuAse I don’t have think straight hair it’s wavy
I love you lol you are so awesome 🥰🙏☺️I DID it my hair last night with your BUTTERFLY CUT video! I did it a year ago and it was time again , although I am letting my hair grow 😉it turned out AMAZING! & I have a natural light wave and thicker hair 😛I loveeeeee my hair! THANK YOU!😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
I am about to do a butterfly hair today I am very excited and thank you for the tutorial . ❤
Super fun and happy 🤩
Take a gluten enzyme pill when you want to drink oat milk and should help
The more you cut the better it looks👩‍🦲← dont cut THAT much
I love love your enthusiasm and wonderful personality!!!!❤
What a crime Saving people money Who can’t afford it!! 🤬the hairdressers who give you shit!!! What are they doing to help people in a financial crisis these days!!! They always cut it to short anyway
😂😂
Always turns out so well, just done it again, will be going back in after to kill off the length cause i like SHORT hair, but an easy way to make sure its got some cute layering before i adjust :D
There are like 8 billion people on the planet and most of them have hair. There are plenty of people to go around and if some of them cut their own hair that still leaves billions more that don't.  An attitude of scarcity doesn't build your clientele. Relax and realize that there are customers O'Plenty. Besides, many people cant follow basic directions and you'll be fixing the results.
Brad, coconut milk is my fake milk
I think I'm gonna do the cut ✂️ 😮 Just looks too easy !!!!
I did mine today (btw I am 11) and it looks so good, your tutorial is great! I have literally never touched my hair at all meaning I never straightened nor curled or cut by myself or without going to the hair stylist so I was nervous but it turned out amazing with your tutorial even with very very very very long hair!!!
His voice
I did that - I messed up - its been 2 years - my hair is still ruined. so yeah dont do it if you never cut your hair before lol.
THANK YOU BRAD FOR SHARING A BUTTERFLY CUT, I'M GONNA TRY IT ❤❤❤❤
"can you imagine being allergic to oat milk?" Brad my dear, my son is allergic to dairy, cows milk. But I'd like to say, try almond milk if oat milk doesn't agree with you, I give my dairy free son almond milk all the time and he loves it ☺️
Holy crap you are so funny 😂😂 this was a great video!!
Brad please create a diy haircut for short hair.
second b!tch really started the video ripping her hair out ._.
Six inches and two hairs😂
The second lady needed to cut all the yellow off
brad my hair has never looked better you ate this and so did I
Luckily, my Mom was a rebel and taught me to be adventurous. She always cut my hair till I was ready to take the scissors! ✂️ I have bleached n colored my hair since high school! I do the whole family now… even the dog! I have taught myself to do acrylic, polygel n gel X nails. I now do my own Botox!!!  There’s nothing you can do. I appreciate people like you Brad who share their gifts!! ❤
The hair is hairring today 😂❤
With the economy the way it is, lots of people can’t afford to go to a Salon. I have a disability that prevents me from driving and makes it difficult to move.  I’ve seen moms cut their own hair and it never looked well so I always feared to do so. but when I saw the tutorial it made me realize that with all the safety nets it has that it would probably ok. I’ve cut my own hair ever since then. The extra $60 to $80every to months is so helpful. Thank you brad.
Brad stuck a nerve with all the hairdressers just coasting on their "professionalism." When my home cuts turn out better than your jank-ass technique, you deserve the lost business.
I’m not brave enough to do that
I've been cutting and coloring my own hair pretty much since my teens. Occasionally I'll go to a stylist, but I've only found one who actually cut it as short as I asked, and upkeep is expensive. So I figure it out myself. You're doing a service.
“✨SkEtChY✨”
“So f*ck all those hairdresses out there who are giving me a hard time” This is so realistic, and I love it. Please keep helping people learn to cut hair!!!
Im gonna do this now. Bye.
With the way prices keep going up, some people CAN'T AFFORD to go to salons to get their hair cut.  Sorry, but that's the way it is.
They look great! I can’t get my hair to do this. I can’t get the sections right and the back ponytail ain’t high enough. So I don’t know what I’m doing. I’m going to have to stick with longish split end length hair.
Love all your videos! Thanks for showing people ways to do their hair for those who can't afford a hairdresser. ❤
I have shorter very fine hair. Trying to find a cut I can do on myself like this but my hair is too short for this. Right now it’s to the bottom of my neck/top of shoulders. Any suggestions @BradMondo ?
I mean your tutorials are helpful for some basics at home layering  hair cuts, but if i wanted a more complex haircut and or coloring i would definitely go to a hairdresser, so don't feel bad
Hi Brad! I followed ur butterfly haircut tutorial and combined it with ur curtain bangs tutorial. I LOVE THE RESULTS! Too bad I didn't took a VIDEO. thank u!!!!
I been doing this cut, thanks to Brad I like hair cut. I have a very thin hair and very straight, and  I'm kinda wash and wear hair girl. But it looks good it even gives volume even without styling it. Next time I will try to video it thank you soooouch Brad😘😘😘.
" That's a good 6 inches and about 2 hairs" I am dying 😭. ( Rewatching The Video )
Omg Jenna Phipps ❤
Very nice of you to share ♥️  I’m definitely doing this too.
Thank you for thinking of everyone ❤
Brad and these girls are all so adorable!  I love watching his reactions.   Thanks for the video!
I hear you fuck them
😂 six inches and about two hairs 😂 he’s so crazy @11:50
@ Brad Mondo,   OMG When Brad Said The Name Ratchet I Immediately Thought Of Ratchet From The Television Show Transformers Prime
My hair is very long  and I have like 5x more volume than those girls but its flat and boring, I wonder if I can make that haircut looks good on my hair, I like layers
This changed me , thank you 💯🎉😂❤
Thank you, Brad.  I saw the butterfly cut tutorial and the cut is gorgeous. I am going to cut my hair now with the butterfly cut!  🦋 (It wasn't this one on your channel.)
❤
Ya i still grab a sharp pair and take a little here and there off the ends. Usually you cant tell ( thick , wavy hair that tends to puff) so its usually forgiving
I'm not about to do that to my own hair because with my luck or the lack thereof I'd mess it up! I really want a professional, like you, to do it! You busy?
Who knows where I can get his hoodie?
After watching a mermaid cut video from Brad, I did it but didn't record it (sorry Brad!). The wolf cut I absolutely loved, but the mermaid cut, not so much. Yes, it had lots of layers, but I really went for it, and I couldn't use a ponytail after the cut, and I work in a factory,  so I needed my hair back.
Thank you Brad.  Sending love and hugs for the info. 🦋 ✂️ 👩🏻
I cut my hair at home but I didn't know what to do so I just grabbed chunks of hair and cut it downwords. I didn't know what to call my hairstyle so i looked at your videos and I found out it was a layered haircut/butterfly cut because of you. Thank you brad
As a high school senior in 1973, we went for a do it yourself haircut like that to look like Farrah Fawcett.  Back then, we all had long hair,parted in the middle.   My mom decided to trim my hair , but with one ponytail. Well, I had a major panic attack because it was the WORST HAIRCUT OF MY LIFE!  Yes, 50 years ago we tried this.  I laugh so hard about it now.  I ought to get on my FB and mention that haircut that most girls had done during our lunch break.
I'm glad l found your video. I had a hairdresser who first of all, charged me a small fortune just to trim my hair. Second, because l have a lot of curly hair, l would wash and style my hair the night before to make her job easier. So basically, l was doing half her job and yet she still charged me full price plus the tip. Anyway, she has been trimming my hair for about 10 years, approximately 3 times a year. Well, the last two appointments l had to reschedule for legitimate reasons and she was so upset she dumped me!! She made approximately $600 over the years by saving her time and product. And on top of that, there were quite a few times she did a horrible job, she even butched my bangs, but l was too lazy or scared to try someone new. She was a witch anyway, so it was best. I recently went to someone else that did a so so job, so l'm looking forward to cutting my own hair and saving tons of money!! Your video has given me the courage to try it!! Thank you!!! ❤
A very looooong time ago, when I was friends with the manager of Jay Sebring's Salon in LA, he cut my long hair into a shag and then showed me how to cut my own hair in the future. He taught me to part my hair into 8ths, tie into pony tails  and cut straight across. I've been doing it ever since at different lengths. Ive saved a fortune in hair cuts. Glad to see its being taught again. 👍
Soy milk + matcha is very good
Next line in your rap: this will be your demise.
I don't have layers but I'm planing to get the butterfly cut at a hairdresser because I do not trust myself to cut my own hair
"it's a good 6 inches and about 2 hairs" 😂😂😂😂😂 that's why we loveeeee you Brad! ❤❤❤
Brad, I absolutely ❤ love you for showing us this cut. I did it, and I absolutely love it! My hair looks thicker and it reminds me of the mid 70's when we all wanted that "Wing" haircut Thank You so so so very much.
Oat milk is starch juice… not very good for you honestly!
I literally used your butterfly cut tutorial about 2 weeks ago. My hair is on the thicker side and wavy. I had terrible split ends and damage due to bleaching and heatvstyling. This cut gave LIFE to my hair and it looks soooo pretty when I curl/wave my hair
OK I am going to attempt this butterfly haircut! I have waist length hair straight, light Blondiesblondish, brown little bit of gray around the frame on my face. Now this is going to be a real challenge because I have some bangs but if I pull straight down they come down to the bottom of my nose maybe to the top of my lip.   I’ve cut my own hair many many times never this butterfly cut and I add my own highlights and lowlights Period Normally, I’d like to have my haircut about to my shoulders because I’m 62 and I just don’t care for that long hair. But my hair grows enormously fast!   No, I have you thinning shears, razor blades and things to get a particular style so this will be really interesting! If I don’t like it, I’ll just go up to the salon to JCPenney and have them do it do something with it. Lol.😂😵‍💫🤷🏼‍♀️
Oh my gosh I love love love you. Thank you for teaching me this technique. It turned out awesome. When I was young I always had a ferret fawcett hair cut tons on long layers. Now I’m on disability and haven’t been able to afford a hair dresser for years. You are amazing and so funny. Thank you once again. I can never say how much you helped me to feel a bit better about my self
Beautiful
Beautiful heart
Yeah. That was a good video. I have bangs straight across; point cut. So this will be my next haircut. I got the perfect bang cut from another guy but I must try this butterfly thing. I'll just include the bangs with the front, dome thing. I've been doing my own hair for years and years from videos on here. And they have really improved as each new person has joined. The first cut was insane. But it worked. That girl has long gone from YouTube, it was that long ago. You were probably about age 12.
I tried it too and it is awesome ❤
Lmao it’s a good 6in and 2 hairs
I live in san Francisco and i cannot afford the hair dresser here. Its $300.
The cough🥲
13:15 Does anyone know how the black haircurler she uses is called?
❤❤❤ I just did your butterfly cut and it came out. Your instructions were easy to follow and you have the video that if you couldn't understand this so you could. My hair hasn't looked this good since it was 16. And that's 42 years ago.
Fixed income here🤚🏼 Thanks for offering an option to those of us who don’t have endless dollars to spend at a salon.
I’m going to be doing this cut today… super scared! 😂😂😂😂😮
Hey i have done and the result amazing.. just i did a bit longer than normal size cuz my hair is too long.. thanks for ur advice
Brad, thank you! You're amazing💖
Your disgusting
Thank u 🙏
How fantastic and fabulous are you!
Loving your responses🎉
I just cut my hair and I ended up having to cut little more off because my hair is so Long. Thank you and Yes I wet my hair before cutting it. My hair curls up after I cut my hair. LMFAO
Let me tell you something… I love Brad Mondo’s tutorial and they are so helpful. Hairdresser are mad, but most of them don’t even know how to cut or bleach hair properly. They burn, damage, and cut like a sh*t my hair. I had to do a short ass bob to regrow my hair. Now, distance of 2 years I have really long and shiny hair and I’m  cutting it on my own with Brad mondo butterfly haircut tutorial and I cannot feel more better. THANK YOU BRAD I LOVE YOU WITH ALL MY HEART AND SOUL❤❤❤❤
💜💜💜💜🫶
I'm 62, I just did this cut, but I did it on bone dry hair.  Came out perfect.  Brad your a sweetheart 💓
She mentioned you… https://youtu.be/KjPSvYKG40I?si=T8Z-Jysgkdbkg5DK
Brad, you amaze me, I love everything about you. You always make me laugh . Keep up the great work . I am also a hair stylist , I don't feel like home haircuts will break my bank. The flowbee  hir cut system for your vacuum never did , it only brought me more fix it customers. Those are the best kind of customers that last forever.
Hell yes!! They're going to do it anyway, why not help.
What if my bangs haven't grown out enough? Can I still do this?
I think a side Part is so much better
Hey hairdressers get business from fixing the fails! And not everyone wants to cut their own hair. I'm sorry if hairdressers are actually getting less customers though. They had it rough having to shut up shop during the pandemic and some people are on tighter budgets these days. I've always cut my own hair though. In between hairdresser visits. I know it's not advisable, but I might try a balayage or highlights at home at some point even though I've seen a terrible fail video.

I learned how to cut my hair before curl it😍😍
Thank you for your butterfly cut tutorial. I didn’t record my cutting but it turned out wonderful!  I’m older and stylist are always wanting to give me an old lady’s haircut.  I love you so much for sharing.
Love the style and amazing look
1:41 theres no l 😭😭😭
This was fun!
Try coconut milk in your matcha.
Brad I have been watching you for a while and I just want to ask if I can cut butterfly cut while having bangs is that okay
The first girl that cut her thin/fine hair came out really nice. I've got baby fine hair and can't stand it going too much further than shoulder length because it gets stringy thin like her longest hair when she started the cut.
Brad I'm 66 and an old lady. I wish you could see my hair almost to my butt and so thick and curly. I love the butterfly cut and or the wolf cut soom day I'm going to cut it and have my granddaughter record it for you. They use to call Me Farrah Fawcett
tbh i havent gone to a salon since i was probably about 12, im now 17 and my mom has been cutting and dying my hair for years, and ngl dont miss salons, less money, maybe 50 dollars for a full dyed head of hair including bleach and 2-3 jars of hair dye as my hair is thick, have everything else, mom learned how to bleach hair bc of me lmao. love you brad!!!
@ BradMondo❤ https://youtu.be/KjPSvYKG40I?si=SvlnXabdk1lDHdC_
Are you the one that started the butterfly cut craze? If so ... Gurl, you need to really go into the technique because it's being done wrong all over the place. It's not just about a pony! It's about where to put the pony, how long to cut, and how to fix the issues home cutters are going to experience because they use dull paper scissors instead of super-sharp, quality hair scissors. I've seen folks use cuticle scissors all the way up to large fabric shears. I even saw someone use sheep-shearing scissors. NO shit.   Now, there are many, many folks fu578ng up the process because the process and theory weren't clear. "Brad Mondo" did it, so it's good ... Yeah, you presented the theory, but didn't specify. Want to know how many folks didn't understand? Watch Hair Buddha. He does a lot of TicTok video reviews that show how many folks don't understand your process.  I know that you know what you're doing, but this isn't something for most home barbers will (calling them barbers because they're certainly not stylists).  Check out all of the fails. Oh, so many fails.   So, watching the video of the follower, she has a great pair of very sharp scissors. One and done. Many folks that try your method are using dull scissors and have to cut, cut, cut .. then cut shorter to match the shortest cut, but it's still uneven, so they do it again ... and again ... until it's way too short.  As evidenced by "Round 3".
April G  Brads comment;  "Its a good 6 inches and TWO hairs"   Im still crying 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Enjoy your video, but language is an issue for me.
Listen I’m a broke mom of 4 and yes I’m cutting my own hair and yes I’m looking up how to do it at home with Brad mondo 🎉 ❤
Hi Brad, saw ur tutorial ,I've been doing my own hair cut since last more than 30..35 yrs n hey I've been doing it the same way as uve shown❤
For each success, there are 10 fails 😂 the hairdressers that are correcting the DIY fails are doing fine, I'm sure😂❤
lol, very funny!!! You are awesome ❤
honestly as a broke college student who impulsively bought hair shears with my tiny allowance, *love* your tuts. saves money, looks cool, and really easy!! literally doable 3 hours before class!! ...tbh though it's probs my 2a/2b waves that hide how choppy some layers are 😭
I think I am a fan.
I know you’ll probably never see this, but I just want to say THANK YOU! I have been using this cut for a year and my hair looks awesome every time. I lost my job a few years ago and do not have the money to go out and get my haircut. I might be dealing with challenges but at least I look good. 😎 I am truly grateful thank you. 💜🧡🩷
Who comes here for the hair? I come here for the HUMOR!
Love you Brad!
I wonder if it works on thick frizzy waves? I kinda want to try it but I'm terrified
I’m dealing with a lot of grief and loss lately and honestly feel like big chopping my long hair. But I know that’s an emotional decision. I do need layers and a trim though, so I figure it’ll be just as cathartic to try cutting my own hair for the first time. I have curly hair too. Got a haircut kit today and I’m trying this tonight, wish me luck!!
Oh my god I love your vids I'm really happy with your reactions it helps me decide what I do
I have very thin hair (much like the second woman) and hate how lifeless my hair looks but I’m also afraid addling layers in will just make it look even thinner because I have so little hair to work with
❤❤❤😍🙏❤❤❤
Where can I get that curler?
Oat milk no good, soy no good almond no good
The begining was Cringe cringe cringe
OMG you are the only other person I've heard of with an oat milk allergy! I just found out I was allergic to oats in July and I am ANNOYED
i need to find a hairdresser... local ones are famous for doing whatever they want except what you ask - and no, is not flattering-
Thank you Brad, I love the butterfly cut, I can't afford to get my hair done regularly nor have the time, so this is great for in betweens!!!
If ur doing the butterfly cut wouldn't both sides come out more even if u cut up down instead of side to side that way when u let it down its at least even on both sides. Most people cut crooked lines in the videos ive seen
Thank you, cause I can't afford the cost of a salon.
Don't be sorry- some of us don't have the $  to always go to a hairstylist. I watched that tutorial about 20x, and am trying it this week.  Not videoing it though, lol.
12:10 this caught me off guard💀😭
I did a full cut for the first time today using the butterfly cut tutorial and used a razor to thin and blend and I love it! Thank you Brad ❤❤❤❤ Finances have been rough since federal loan payments are due and going to the salon is so expensive these days. I usually color my hair to save some money.
They all did great!
Oat milk and Almond milk are toxic Brad. DYOR honey. ❤
I dont know last time i cut my hair but maybe 2019 or 2020 at home lol. gonna do it soon at home but been putting it off forever its so long and stringy even tho its my natural hair its so blah.
I did a butterfly cut today.. I also do have my cosmo license, but in a different state than where I live. I have very curly hair.. it was breaking and I was done with it. I gotta say I followed Brads tutorial to the T. It came out great!!!!
I always have to give my hairdresser more money because I keep messing up my hair 😂 she's not angry at me.
Oh my gosh i love it, i try it yesterday, it works ❤❤❤ Thank you so much ❤❤❤
Was wondering if theres a particular face shape this works best with or any face works?
The hairdressers just don’t listen to us! Like I went in and asked for a butterfly cut and she was like “you guys have all these names for things but we don’t know what you mean. Can I see a picture?”   lol like what? Why not stay on top of popular trends when this is your actual job…? She just gave me a few face framing layers which I don’t think is what I wanted 🤷🏻‍♀️
Ha😂
I'm actually thankful you teached us how to cut hair properly, I couldn't afford going to the salon anymore, it's too expensive and my hair grows super fast... I followed your tutorial and now my hair looks amazing!!! Thank you so much for teaching the right way with all the tips!
My son has allergies… if you consume oats while allergic you can turn it into an anaphylactic allergy. Try almond or rice milk with your matcha
I ligit got my hair cut recently and the girl totally did the opposite of what i wanted gave me blunt straight across ends without any layering took off like 3-4 inches when she said an 1 1/2 inches to me good lord am i glad for this tutorial it saved my hair and gave me exactly what I wanted in the first place. It may not be perfect, but it's a lot more like what i originally wanted.
I love my butterfly cut. I didn't do it myself, I went to a salon. I have medium length, fine, straight, hair. It's easy to style with a round brush, and blow-dryer. I use a shine spray to finish for shine and texture.
I love how they're all athin hair girlies, i never found ones with this hair type and i was scared to try it for this reason, imma go for it now
I have curly hair and did it on mine, i cut off about 6-8 inches and it looks great! I love it
OMG...mine looks amazing...I must have done it so well!.....❤
My daughter absolutely loves you and your products. She has done this cut on her hair a few times now and it looks so good. Better than when she has gone to the stylist and asked for layers.
Brad, my hair is down to my butt and has not been cut in a very long time out of mostly fear LOL, I do not want to lose a lot of length but I would like it to have some life to it Some framing around the face and the dead ends gone I want to try this much do you think I should take off the front pony and off the back pony. My hair literally goes right to my butt. And with the length that my hair is would it even be possible for me to do this by myself? 😬😅
I’m pregnant and I can’t redo my highlights due to complications. So I dyed my hair all black and did the butterfly cut! It come out good. I’ve received so many compliments and I love my hair now. ❤
What?! She looks so good!
Ok, getting out of bed now because I must try this haircut!
I  love you but, please don't use our Lord's name in vain.
My hair is literally the same thinness of the second girls hair 😢
Keep being awesome brad ❤
Not me thinking of doing this almost at midnight to my 30" hair. 😅😅
Proof is in the pudding.
oy
I’m a dog groomer so I think I can handle this 😂
Personally, I won’t go to salons anymore. My hair is very long and thick. I ask for a trim..just a few inches…8 inches later I vowed to never let anyone cut my hair. I tried to go for highlights..stylist melted my hair off.  Point being, people like me are so thankful for your tutorials.
Brad, you are truly wonderful and thank you so much for everything you do!   You are a shining star of all this, and all the best possible ways. You care, you're excited, enthusiastic, high intelligence, huge style and Technical ability. Hilarious, warm, truly caring about us, charming, no nonsense 🧡🧡🧡👏🏆  Yes your mind is so full of so much creativity, problem-solving, technical and beauty info, you can't keep it all straight! So yeah just make videos of it for us and you to watch and re-watch! 😅❤  I love the ways you think.
I didn't know about this cut and your tutorial but found a short with this cut and tried it on my curly hair and now I know whom to thank for the awesome cut...Thank You Sir 🙌🏼❤
I have a suggestion for the hairdressers giving Brad a hard time: Shut up and go get some decent training.  Here's why. I have very thick, fine, lightly wavy hair. Hence, scissors cuts look TERRIBLE on my  hair. The ONLY way for me to get a haircut that doesn't make me look like I had an argument with a lawnmower and lost, is to cut my hair with a straight razor. Do you think I can a hairdresser who knows how to do a razor cut? No. No. Apparently no one knows how to do a razor cut anymore.  So. . . I followed Brads butterfly tutorial exactly, except I used a straight razor instead of scissors. It came out flawless and beautiful and perfect. So yeah, I love Brad, and why should I waste my money at a salon to get a bad haircut?  People who want to call themselves hairdressers need to learn to use the best methods for the type of hair the client has. If they need continuing education to learn how to razor cut then they need to go get it.  So yeah, bye-bye all you salon "hairdressers". And many thanks and hugs to Brad.
I’ve done this and it worked out really good. However, it gave me a v shape in back and I prefer a straight across shape. Also, as it grew out it was less manageable.  I went to a stylist after the lockdowns and got a proper layered cut. From a good stylist, a great haircut that styled well considerably longer than butterfly.  But, it’s not always easy to find a good hairstylist. In my area stylist here are very prejudiced against senior grey hair women. They only want young girls in. The last stylist did a great job and I called to rebook. Her calls always goes to voice mail. Now that she knows I’m a 60 year old woman she’s ghosted me.  Only stylist for women of my age, in my area, are the walk in places. Sucks!  Those places are hit or miss, and quite frankly the at home Butterfly cut is a more sure bet.
Could someone please tell me what kind of styling tool the person at 13:13 is using? I've tried searching for it, but no luck so far!
Omg the first girl was doing way too much it gave me anxiety
Does it have to be parted in the middle afterwards?
I am a stylist also... I did this to my own hair... fabs!  Who said Cosmetologists can't make their own hair pretty too! Thanks hun!
Try almond milk as a replacement for the oat.
Brad I did butterfly cut yesterday and OH MY GOD I SLAYEDDD ppl think I got it done from a salon and its better than all the times Ive got it done from a salon..IM SO HAPPY I LOVE YOUU
Im a 39 year old who works all the time, busy with kids and due to a bald spot and self.conscious to go to the salon. Ur videos helped me to cut it myself. And it came out great. I bought hair scissors and thinning scissor and the thinning scissors worked awesome. The layering i got was perfect.
Brad you are a hero without a cape. Im someone who would spend $200 at a reputable salon and still walk out not having gotten what i wanted or worse, lopsided layers and bangs. So if im gonna mess up my hair im gonna do it for free at home. And honestly ever since you put up the butterfly cut vid ive been doing it myself and it looks so good and i couldn’t be happier ❤️
I need tips and tricks to do my hair because my hair is like trash
i my god help me please
Sooo...I finally did this! I'm not a a young Chicken anymore...I'm 57 actually and the last times I have been to hair salons I was regretting it every time. Long story short my hair was so long I was literally sitting on it and I was tired of my braids and boring look. I also have Rheumatoid Arthritis and bent fingers...not kidding...bent! I went ahead and did this hair cut. I had to take like 15 to 16 inches off. I also used a comb to hold the hair in place when I cut it as I can not hold it in my bent fingers due to the Arthritis. Works just as good and actually cut it straighter that way. I also used a ton of Conditioner to be able to comb my length. Did the front pony tail first...cut it, point cut it then clipped it to the side. Then I brushed the back part over my head bending all the way down as my arms are shorter then my hair. LOL my hair touched the floor in front of me but I did it. Cut, point cut, done...go rinse out my conditioner, style it and.....FABULOUS!!!  My Hubby said it's the best looking hair cut I had in years! I think so too. Thank you so much!
Screw the haters!!! Providing tips and tricks isn’t going to stop people from doing their hair at home. I would never do it, but some only do it at home. Either way, you’re amazing! ❤
These videos make me so happy.
I tried the cut, it worked great...just keep being you 😊
I appreciate everyone who gives haircutting tutorials to do at home for one main reason...Every salon I've been to has the bad habit of detangling my hair in such a rough way that they end up pulling out a lot of hair. They don't bother spraying some leave in conditioner to help in the detangling process or anything, they just go for it raw. It's made me very scared to visit salons.
I've gotten layers before at the hairdresser. I always end up looking like Alice Cooper 😂. I have really thick wavy hair (2A). I mostly let it grow to my butt before I go for anything because 90 out of 100 I get disappointed.
I love Brad’s videos. I’ve seen this tutorial, but this reaction video just gave me the confidence to give it a shot
what kind of curling wand was that she was using???  anyone know??  please.  thanks.
I COULD WATCH THESE VIDEOS ALL DAY!!!!
Just tried this on myself today (wet hair, proper hair ties, straight part, ponytails combed smoothly). I am so happy with the results. I do get my hair professionally cut when necessary, but this was the refresher I needed. Thank you!
Use Almond milk instead of oat milk.
I just followed your tutorial (and I mean FOLLOWED, like watched 6 times as I did it) and took off at least 8 inches. I just got the haircut that I have tried to describe to my hairdresser for years. It is STUNNING and I really regret not filming it because you would be so proud 😂
This video convinced me to follow Brad's butterfly cut tutorial. I also have not a lot of hair and i think it would do me wonders.
I'm sorry I'm all for DIY  most of the time. When I need a perfect cut and style, I go to a hairdresser
Thanks!
I've never cut anyones hair before but I'm desperately trying to talk my mom into letting me do hers like this
i'm 23 and i haven't gotten my hair cut at a place since i was probably 14 and i've just had not a lot of great experiences with getting my hair cut. like they would mess it up often. and now i like just had two kids and i've been wanting to cut long layers in my hair for sooo long (maybe like 3 months) but have been to scared to go somewhere to pay for it to be done and then they cut my hair too short (literal nightmare) so im sooo happy you made this i did it on myself and wow i don't think my hair is thin or fine but after i cut it i said what the heck where did all this hair come from?? 😂 my hair is naturally wavy and i just look like a lion it looks so majestic and beautiful
BRAD I LOVE YOU I WATCHED UR TUT ON HOW DO TO THE BUTTEFLY HAIR CUT AND IT TURNED OUT AMAZING I FREAKING LOVE UUU praying my mom doesnt kill me xoxo
I mean, I'm pretty good at cutting my own hair, but I suck at curling it. With a curling iron, at least 😅
I’m doing this tonight, I have to. The urge!!!
I am so grateful for your butterfly cut tutorial! I Have used it twice already and it looks amazing. I had very long hair and it's naturally wavy but it was starting to get super flat because of how long it was. I cut them yesterday and Omg the volume and the waves! I love it and it made me save money. Thank you.
This is a you tuber Jenna Phillips I follow her she does thrifting and DIYs
With the state of the economy I’m afraid this is what we are reduced too so thanks for tutorial’s ❤
Hairdressers may be cross because it’s taking away business from them and that’s how they make a living not YouTube etc. Having said that the amount of F-ups we see creates business for them and they can charge more for correction 😂
You tell them hairdressers how it is. I once walked out of a hairdresser refusing to pay the cut was so bad.  So yes...fuck them lol  I can now cut my own quite nicely thanks to you.  You da best
Thank you so much. I can use the extra money for Christmas gifts and stocking stuffers
This might be late by now, but I'm going to say: your oat milk "allergy" sounds like gluten intolerance to me...either that or you're having a reaction to another ingredient (cause there are so many things in vegetable milks)...unfortunately, gluten intolerance isn't really curable; you just stop eating gluten and depending on how bad the intolerance is, you might be able to eat it from time to time without having a reaction...but ignoring it makes it worse, and could potentially lead to celiac disease
Just tried it, it worked!!!! Wish I had recorded it!!!
I always cut my own hair because my mom thought going to ppl just to cut hair is waste of money and I never used hair straightener or curler so
I love your hair darker! I'm going to try this out tomorrow finally. My teen did it to my tween a few months back (without my knowledge) but it turned out so beautiful on her. I've been getting the wolf cut, but have let it grow some. Now I want to try this. I can't wait. 😊
Im lactose intolerant so i gotta have soya which in my opinion dont taste too different to oat milk.. love you brad from the UK ❤
i would love for him to give me a hair cut
here after cutting my hair two days ago by myself for the first with 0 experience! and i’m satisfied with the result lol ❤ happier than ever
My hair is curly so I don’t think I can’t do it by myself this haircut  So I prefer go with a professional hairstyle.
Thank you, Brad Mondo.  Seriously, thank you.  You empower us.
These videos are really great! But, I’m not gonna lie, the reactions to “fail” videos are on another level! 😂
THANK YOU , Brad , my hair looks Beautiful!!!
I love Jenna Phipps ❤ ella hace todo bieen
If its not too much trouble, I would suggest leaving out the bad language. I would love to share your video, but the f word needs to go. Thanks ahead of time.
You’re funny 😄 & a fresh ray of 🌞. I’m about to attempt this one 🤞
Thank you so much for this tutorials! I’m an international student who is broke because of tuition, but still wants to look decent. Usually I cut my hair when I go back to my country since is 10 times cheaper but you save me ❤️ I love my hair so much because of you
I followed your tutorial yesterday and I just wanna say THANK YOU!! I have long and medium thick blonde hair and I have never ever been to a hairdresser before in my life, never even had layers in my hair, just face framing bangs. My mom has always cut my hair but since moving out I have just trimmed my hair a little but by myself. I was getting really bored with it and watched myself always putting my hair up in a bun bc I didn't like the way it looked. Then I found your tutorial, I followed it and I have never been happier with my hair!! So again, thank you! ❤
you know how many people are able to walk around with beautiful hair because of you? 😭😍 thank you brad
So i tried and fucked it up
YALL I CUT IT WILL WATCHING THIS AND T TURNED OUT SAUR DAMN GOOD HELP OMGGGG-
Are you allergic to oat milk or have a gluten intolerance? There are gluten-free oat milk, you could try that. Also soy milk is a great alternative.
I can't get enough of his sarcasm, goofy expressions and helpfulness 😂
“I got people putting ponytails on their forehead “ 😂❤❤❤
You are awesomeness to my heart!!
What these other hairdressers commenting on your videos don’t get: I do not have the money to go to a salon right now. I have no time either. I just want to feel confident so I’m going to cut it myself following your tutorial & using my beauty school drop out knowledge.
Thanks!
As a hairdresser myself I don’t see a problem with it. I think it’s great you help ladies do their own hair if that’s their desire. Also love your content, very entertaining 😅
My own hairdresser grumbles about you. I go to her once a year for a tidy up and i cut my own every 2 months the rest of the time. I personally do not like the way hairdressers cut my hair. Its too blunt, too short and always too uniform looking for my personal tastes. But they will do what I wont, they cut off all the dead bits i sometimes leave for aesthetic reasons (length). What they dont understand is that yes there is a right way to do things, a proper way. But sometimes that way doesnt mesh with someones personal style. Of if the hairdresser can pull it off its often cut in a way that requires too much styling and products to get the style out of the cut and maintain the look day to day. For years you couldnt go and get ypur hair dyed crazy colours at the hairdresser, you had to buy your own. Now that you can, some of the results i see from salons are not quite hitting the alt look. People will always do their own hair. I like doing my own, its part of my self care. Im glad you make videos that help me not fuck up my hair ❤
I was the woman who dropped $100 + at the salon. Had a stroke, hip replacement, hip repair surgery and back issues all before I was 44. Out of work and not able to afford the salon this tutorial took me from 4 inches of dead straggling hair to a cut that as soon as thos pony tail holders came out I felt beautiful again. Those hair dressers need to realize that there are broke people out there and they deserve to look cute too so every one can suck it!!!!❤
Brad is so whole some🤗
Lactaid milk or almond milk if u make it yourself
immmmaaaa doooo ittttt thisss weekend!!!
What if the highest point of my head is the back of my head? Do I really put so much hair in the front ponytail?
measuring with random tools is such a girl math move XD love it
@BradMondo Regarding your oatmilk allergy, it's probably the glyphosate on the grains. Everyone thinks it's "gluten" or an allergy to specific foods but it's actually a reaction to consuming a high amount of pesticides. For perspective.... they say you can wash and blend strawberries and still effectively spray plants because of the amount of pesticide applied. It's extremely unhealthy and of course people are going to have bad reactions! Hope this helps Brad, I hope you see this! Please stay healthy love!
OMG I LOVE IT!!!!❤
Brad you are the best. Wish my hair was long enough to do this. Haters always go after the best of the best. It's great you give people this amazing option❤
Brad i followed your tutorial on my hair which i got a layer cut done before three months. That came out really good thanks to you❤
❤I love it! It came out so good my hair is a little bit curly and my curls are more defined and have a lot of volume, I just did my regular scrunchie routine and it was amazing 😍🎉
I've had my hair ruined by these learned hair dressers -  some only know 1 cut and can't do anything else so no matter you want your hair to look like, it's just a longer or shorter version of the only cut they know.  Nah star. I do my own
Dear,  You keep helping people and don't worry about those hair dressers.
use leave ins and hot oils for really damaged hair. I've seen a world of difference!
OMG FIRST MADE IT SOOOOOOO UNEVEN 😂
love jenna’s videos
To all that took that leap of faith…. 😍😍😍👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻❤️ they all looked stunning!!! Brad was so proud!! 👌🏻💗
I’m a working mom with a young baby at home. Unfortunately, I don’t always have time to go to a hair dresser. Your tutorial gave me so much confidence in how I looked again in postpartum. Thank you so much! ❤
Im have a wavy-cyrly hair, and i really want a wolf cur or a butterfly cut. But idk what to do! Like my mom tells me not to, but…….
I’m in my 40’s and haven’t cut my hair in a decade.  It’s very long, down n to my butt. All natural color and pretty healthy overall, just in ragged shape at the ends. So here’s my issue. My hair is both strait and curly. The part that goes in the front ponytail is stick strait, the rest is really thick tight waves.  I quit cutting my hair because I was forced to either curl half or straitened the other half.   My fed-up solution was just to grow it long and wear a braid.  I’m getting older and wanting to just try something else, and I’m wondering what would you do with such weird bipolar hair?  And have you ever seen such weird hair like mine?
I wonder what this would look like with curly hair with tighter curls
Dang it! I’m going to cut my hair. This should be interesting
6 inches and about 2 hairs OMG😂😂😂😂😭😭😂😂🤣🤣🤣 but her result so good
I JUST DID IT USING YOUR TUTORIAL,  im still drying it but it seems like i layered the back of my head good for the first time  ehehe
I have very long hair and a fringe- do I need to grow my fringe out for this cut? And also is there a back length limit?  …I’m wondering can I still have waist length hair with this cut? ❤
So, the prob is, the angry hairdressers aren't seeing the people who were successful. They are seeing all the fails.
Just saw a video from a dr. Gundry - he said Oats come from the poison oak family / so don’t drink oat milk gundry said
I can’t lie I love when he poses as it gives all the slips of people😂
ok so what do you do when your hair is so thick and straight you can barely get the scissors to cut through it .
Thes video make me want to cut my hair in the middle of the night 🫣
I prefer to cut my own hair because I don’t want to spend money and I don’t care if it’s NOT PERFECT. I’m perfectly imperfect ❤ I would rather give myself a bad haircut and learn, then pay someone to give me a bad haircut anyways lol
I can’t find a good hairdresser where I’m living right now and my hair was making me feel so ugly, I watched your tutorial and decided it was worth doing it myself, I’ve cut, shaved and dyed my hair before so it wasn’t scary. But I followed your butterfly cut and I love it, it’s made me so happy
It’s decided. I’m gonna attempt the butterfly cut tomorrow.
Love love ❤
Brad gets so much hate but like he’s the only hairdresser online that I trust because I’ve followed so many of his tutorials and they’ve always turned out great.
❤❤ I measured the first cut and then I made sure to ponytail the piece I cut off and then used that as the reference/size to measure up the back section so they would be the same size of cut. BUT obviously this is for the peeps who want similar to same size cuts. But it worked!!! Actually reminds me of the mid 70's early 80's feathered hairstyle I always had .....correction, MANY of us had back then. Awesome video and soooo glad YT recommended it to me!!!!! ❤❤
I’m just a happy hairdresser who is happy to cut my own hair, because I don’t trust anyone else with my hair 😅
I love to watch your reactions!
They all did so well and I’m glad
Just don’t drink oat milk… it’s not a good option for the body.
I tried it,  but i cut like 2 inches off which wasnt enough for the cut, but my hair was already short and had bangs, the layers look nice though. (i use mane and tail shampoo so my hair grows a little faster and ill try it next time when my bang growth is past my chin)
I watched your video yesterday.  You made it easier for me to add  better layers to my hair alot easier.  Thank you.  Love you ,  love your videos.  Keep doing it.  Thank you,  thank you,  thank you.
Brad, you mentioned in one of your videos that the Butterfly cut doesn't work well for fine hair. I have fine textured hair but a lot of it at the back - am I likely to get thick ugly lines where the layers fall?
Will this work with a side part too?
I've been doing this cut on myself for 20 years. Never been to the hairdresser's. Think I need royalties 😂
14:44 16:58
I love this but how you can do it with shorter hair?  I cant do my second section ad high without Losing hair 😢
His YouTube video came out on 23rd April 2023
I want to do this hair cut sooo baaad cause I’m so done with my hair I WANT IT GONE my ends are so dead but I’m so scared to mess uuup😭😭😭
Try coconut milk creamer in your matcha, that’s what I use and it tastes pretty good!!😊❤
I cut mine 2 days ago and I have received compliments from every single person I've seen since then 🎉
Can you have almond milk?
Damn, the first one!!! 😱😱😱 Her hair looks amazing!!! 😍😍😍
Omg i'm trying to concentrate through how handsome this dude is. Absolutely beautiful looking lad 😍 okay enough drooling, time to cut my hair 😂
Oh my fucking gawd Brad it is NOT “YOUR haircut!”
I don’t have enough hair to try and I don’t plan to grow it out I don’t know how to style or care for my hair curly when it’s long
❤
😂😂❤❤
Been using this cut before Brad was on YT, lol before YT even existed! cute though!
I did the butterfly cut. It looks decent. I wasn’t going to go to a hairdresser because I’ve been unemployed for 9 months and thought I might just have to live with my lifeless hair. So thank you for the tutorial. Now I have to do the blowout tutorial.
As a barber it’s totally fine to educate online because when they mess it up guess where they’re going 😉  I can’t tell you how many clients I gained because they cut their own hair and I had to fix it for them. Clients come and go no need to hate when a stylist is educating the general public. I’ve learned so much from watching Brad’s videos that when I started school I was already ahead of the curve.
I followed your tutorial and my hair came out freaking great 😍 just had to connect the face framing layers a bit on one side and 🤌🏻 I wish I could comment a picture on here just so I could show you how good that tutorial worked. But I’m sure there’s enough proof on the internet already 😍
Every time I see hairstylists ripping people to shreds for trying to do things at home it just makes me seethe. Not everyone has the funds, the physical ability, the transportation, the location access, ETC ETC ETC to go to a salon. You have no idea what someone has happening in their life, not everyone can “jUsT gO tO tHe sAlOn!!!!”
Can you do this with long hair that already has a few layers?
Brad, where's your hoodie from???? <3
I took the plunge today and did my butterfly cut. Amazeballs! Two cuts and done. Didn't need to connect it, thin it or tidy it. Nothing! Just a glorious hairstyle. Thank you
I love watching you, watch videos of people d.i.y'in off of watching your videos. Cus now I'm going to try what I watched u watch of something you created. Loll so complex
Hair dressers hate you because you 1. Have a vibrant personality 2. You SELL 3. You're EXTRA AF 4. You're a passionate professional 5. You're confident (as a result of point #4)  ✨💪
I can’t wait to try this.
Have you tried cashew milk? So delicious!
Is it possible to do the butterfly cut with bangs
I wish I could like this video more than once. So cute. I’m gonna do it!
Hello beautiful too. I would like to see a video on bangs for various faces, and I hope others will write to say they are interested also.
Yessssssssssss
Are Brad rings just Accessories or are they for treating arthrosis and rhym?
I get that there are some hairdressers losing business because of the wealth of knowledge online, but not everyone following these tutorials at home would’ve gone to a hairdresser anyway. I might even go as far as to say that most of these people wouldn’t’ve gone to a hairdresser. Professional haircuts are expensive! And salons have set hours that may not work for a lot of people. So giving people the knowledge they need to be able to do stuff on their own is extremely helpful. Thank you for the tutorials you make.
The risky nature of doing hair at home is literally what makes it so tempting and enjoyable. Even when I mess up a bit I’m having fun lol
I filled my tummy up and it feels so good.. lol okay this is literally how I talk to myself when no one’s home
A few months ago, my hair was past my butt. It’s straight with a lot of body. I did a 1 ponytail cut. I cut several inches. I wasn’t completely satisfied, but it worked for a month or so. Then, I tried my first “Brad cut” my hair really looked good. The natural volume and wave was terrific Again, I took it to another level this week. I changed up the part (unicorn ponytail) in my last cut, and I slightly re-angled the top and cut more off. The result is stunning I must say. 💙💙💙💙💙
I love you so much!! I come here just for the positivity sometimes. Other times I’m here to learn. You are the BEST!! 🥰🥰🥰
I DID IT!!!!! 4am cut!  Thank you BM and ladies and all of the commentaries!  Nice insomniac push!!!!!  This is the best 'his rejection is the universe's protection' haircut proof!  Ha!  I lovlovlov Brad Mondo!
Yea... I grew out my bangs a bunch and decided I'd do a butterfly cut on them because I had layered the rest of my hair already, but my hair doesn't lay evenly, so one side has a little volume and the other is flat and goes in a weird direction. It doesnt matter what styling I do, the bangs never ever work. So i went back to my old side bangs to wait until they grow out all the way again. Im sure half my issue is that my hair is naturally pretty curly, but super thin.
so sad , I had to quit oat milk too.  oatmilk is asctually bad for us, too many gums and chemicals. they have even recalled certain brands
Those hairdressers should stop being angry at you! You're doing such a great job with your tutorials and videos in general. Also you helped me get a better feeling for my body by showing all those cuts and stuff. This was something that helped me with my mental health a lot because as a perfectionist I really learned from you that hair grows back (not that I didn't know that before, my hair grows mega fast - but the thinking in general that it is okay helped me a lot). Another reason your tutorials are amazing is, when you don't have enough money for a hairdresser. Where I live a haircut costs between 40 and 100 € and it's hard when you don't have enough money every month. Hair grows and hair needs trims - so if you have those situations as I have, you run into a mental health cicle because you don't know how to pay the hairdresser. That's why it is amazing that people like you show us how to cut our hair. It's not that I don't want to support hairdressers, but there are so many reasons why it is helpful to do your own hair. I even cut my mothers hair during covid thanks to your videos
Does anyone know where his hoodie is from???!!!
That intro got us all pregs- thanks for that 🥂
Brad, thank you for the tutorial. I have many allergies and can not go into a hair salon without becoming very sick. My area doesn't have people who could come to my home and use my allergen free products to do my hair either. This has been everything to me.
i'm gonna do it!! im gonna do eeeeet! 😍
You did well❤
So far I'm only seeing love for you no haters found today..... refreshing. I'm gonna browse a few more techniques but will probably decide on the butterfly as for the last hair cut I gave myself a couple years back I was extremely drunk and now that it's grown out it needs some evening out, thank God for pony tails cause there's a good 3-4 inch difference in some spots
Hey Brad, what's wrong with your eye?  Looks like you got into a brawl.
DON'T YOU DARE APOLOGIZE FOR HELPING US!
Hi i did this hair cut and i love it ❤ i've cut my own hair for years now i rather do it on my own because hairstylist just are not like back in the day hairstylist that's my opinion but i love Brad ❤ So Thank you Brad for all your tips on showing how to do hair (cutting /styling) at home !😊
I also want to say, I do go to the hair dresser sometimes.....but sometimes random kids tell me my hair looks like dead grass and I go home and immediately chop it. You're just keeping me from 6 months of regret
I love your personality 😂 tha ks for all the wisdom you share.
I was worried the first girl didn’t remember that the hair will look shorter after drying.
Almond milk!! Also im a hairdresser. Im not mad lmao. I didnt realize people got mad at you. But i guess i can see it now. Still love you 😂❤ i think i just get mad when people act like they can do something better or cleaner than i can when i got taught properly. Im not perfect or good at everything by the way. I do think people these days including non hair dressers are very talented in all sorts of ways. But if someone acts entitled and as if my job is easy no i dont like that shit cuz no one does no matter what the job is; doctor, dentist, vet, clothing stylist, interior designer idc no one wants to feel like they aren’t important or necessary. But everyone is. So no one should make anyone feel that way. A client at a shop i worked at before made me feel like i didn’t have knowledge just because I’m young. Which also isn’t cool. But i went to school for this and they didn’t. Just like i wouldn’t do that to someone in another profession. I’ll always love and watch your videos and think people who did good did good and even maybe subscribe to them too. I think mostly people do it because it’s fun. And empowering. Also the pandemic. I love watching any type of hair videos. Thank you for your channel and being you ❤ P.S. I swear 70% of people you react to do a great job or make it work themselves
Lmao I’m a hair dresser but due to my lack of time I cut my hair like this
@brad look up what oat milk is made of. It's really bad for you. It's barely made of oat!
So, this guy makes fun of people using his ideas? What a weirdo.
Brad I do this cut and you have save me so much money!!! Thank you!
oatmilk ---> almond milk or coconut milk with match tastes SOOO good!  I know the feeling of annoying allergies. I'm allergic to chocolate...
Fun fun💕💕💕
I've been so grateful for the butterfly cut.  I can't justify a salon, and now my hair looks tidy and cared for .  Thankyou Brad.
I love you brad thanks for being you
the amount of times I clapped when the last girl was LISTENING👏🏾👏🏾
Yes the cool blonde is not it for her skin tone tbh
I could never afford to go to a hairdresser. So all those other hairdressers can suck a butt because what am I supposed to go through life looking fugly b/c I can't afford to go to a salon? Well that's not fair. Soooo thank you. ❤
I’m so mad right now bc I just asked my mom if I could get a wolf cut or a buttery fly cut and she said no! I really want one but she said “you won’t like it bc u won’t be able to put it up” but I barely ever put my hair up! I just really want a wolf cut!
Ever since I did the wolf cut when I was 9 currently 16 I've never stopped I love how cute this hair looks on me it defines the cuteness and chubbiness in my face and the eyeliner makes it cuter
I don’t know about you guys but I LOVE that Brad’s shirt is kinda like a butterfly. It matches the video so well!❤🦋
Missed the opportunity to say you didn't want anybodys butterfly on your hands 😂
thank you cus not everyone has the money for a hair salon 😭
Hi Brad hope your well, try coconut milk, believe me you love it, sending love from the uk ❤
I  rlly don’t understand the hate,hes just tryna help ppl plus if you dont like him then why you even bother to watch him,if u dont like him don’t watch him its that easy, if u don’t stand him sit down it not that hard
Do I need to cut the exact same amount off each pony? 😘💗
Of course it looks amazing!  It's your Brad Mondo Butterfly Cut!!  It slays every time!!
Most people with gluten allergies are alergic to oats too.  Try soy milk?  Trader Joe's has one that's just soy and water, nothing else!  It's good.
My son's hair is like yours in brown.  What products do you use to make it thicker etc.?
I do the Butterfly Cut every couple to few months!  Long natural brunette 2a. fine with medium circumference.   I love that I can do my hair w/o taking the chance on stylists at salons.  I can control how much is cut etc.  I'm super grateful Brad!! There are so many faux BC's out there.  Yours is always the best.
You tell ‘em brad
I'm 13 (girl) and my mother (40) I'm going to colour her hair today and she's also going to follow your tutorial (with my help ofc) but this was literally our conversation😂❤  Mom: Hey Abi do you want to colour my hair today  Me: Yeah sure!  Mom: I'm also going to do the butterfly cut, i watched this tutorial by this cute sandy blonde guy i forgot his name  Me:.....Brad Mondo?  Mom: Yeah that's his name  😂😂😂
Sorry not sorry im not paying 80+dollars to get my hair cut every 4 to 6 weeks.
I actually really want to know what kind of curling tool that is on the second video and where do i find one???
Watching this so I know what NOT to do in the next 30 minutes
Honestly, most of the people who are going to go get their hair done are still getting their hair done proffesionally. Those who want to cut their own hair are doing to do it regardless of whether or not you make videos. You're just helping them look better. And if they screw up then they still have to go to a professional to fix it.
I wanna cut my hair as well!! So good one!
😊❤ I personally want 2 THANK U 4 your tutorial. I can't afford 2 go 2 the salon, but I WAS able 2 give myself the Butterfly Cut w/face framing & it looks SOOOO AWESOME!!! Better than anything I've gotten at a salon!
JENNA❤️❤️❤️
I just did it on my hair that I bleach fried 2 years ago, a lot of it grew back already. But the top ends were still damaged and I didn't want to lose much of the length. This cut was a great option. It Looks so good and my hair feels so much healthier 🥰 thank you 🙏
Okay Brad, you think you're allergic to oat milk? Well there's a few questions to ask about that. Are you allergic to oatmeal? Are you allergic to oats? If not you're not allergic to oat milk. Unless you're buying the crap at the store that has a lot of preservatives in it because real oat milk doesn't last very long. It's literally oats soaking in water, and then sometimes sweetener added. You could be allergic to the preservatives in it though. And I love how you said that you had a green tea with blueberry and that gave you some energy? Do you know how much caffeine is in matcha? Way more than will ever be in bagged green tea! And you had two 😂 matchas... Yikes
I've got ultra fine hair and every stylist I've ever gone to has told me my hair is never gonna show layers...which is what I want (without having to curl and such). I wish I'd recorded myself doing this cut, but I have gorgeous layers and I love it so much! My sister did the world cut and also loved how hers turned out. ^_^
Thé faces
Watching these videos is making me less scared of hair care. I know it sounds weird but the stylist my mom took me to growing up was a real piece of work and made me afraid to do pretty much anything to my hair, even basic cuts. Both her and my mom were convinced you should never experiment with your hair and if you did it’d be messed up for life.  Now I’m getting a lot more confident and realizing that a lot of their fears were either exaggerated or totally false. Now I can do a basic dye job at home (screw you mom, I’m a red head now and I love it!) and may even have the confidence to do a little cut next time it grows out! Thank you Brad! 😊❤
Oatmilk gives u a greater Inslinrush than Coke, its full of Phytic acid and i think you are from the US? Then also Glyphosate, do not drink it
Hey Brad, do you recommend this style for really thick hair!
Hair cuts are not so much risky - getting a tattoo is risky - hair grows back so there is that!
End of the day folks - especially these days - with lock downs etc - will try and do their own heir. Stuff other hair dressers Brad - you are doing the lords work - haha.  Seriously though ANY YouTube instruction videos are great so do not feel bad. We all luv you! xxx
Would this work with a side part ?
Love you! Thank you for helping me!!
Hey Brad Mondo. Question: what's the difference between a wolf cut and a butterfly cut?
I have thinning curly hair and I really struggle with how flat my hair looks with a middle part. Anyway I used your tutorial and it looks so fresh and gave it a ton of texture and body and I saved like $90
It comes across SO tacky to me when I have seen hairdressers complain about you.
I think you have a crush on April
"We did not end this in a panic attack." I love it. :)
Good job
Wow thanks Brad ❤❤❤
Hellooooo I have thick non straight but not curly long hair....I'm hesitating between a wolf cut and a butterfly 👀 I'm going for a 80's look...any recommendations?
Maybe try soy milk..don’t know if you have or not..I’m a huge fan of very vanilla and I have a milk allergy too..good luck my friend
😂😂😂
That’s it I’m doing this cut
did anyone else notice that he was wearing a butterfly/fairy hoodie the whole time?
I LOVE JENNA!! She is an amazing creator
I just think you’re fabulous..like, you truly make my life happier! You’re such a sweetheart- thank you for being you ❤
Watching these and waiting for my mom so that i can shock her with the news
I went to the hairdresser today and got a butterfly cut with curtain bangs, and it is my favorite thing that's ever happened. Plus middle school starts tomorrow
I'm regretting going to a hairdresser so much I watched Brad's video first and all thought I have done layers and wolf cut on myself after watching his videos, I thought it would be better to get a haircut done by a hairdresser also because I've been to her before and she has slayed my layers and also my mom got a deep V cut from her recently which I liked cause I didn't want to lose the length of my hair....but she ruined my hair😭😭😭....she gave me a weird U shape and also cut almost 5 inches but the worst she did it uneven and when I was telling her about it she gaslighted me saying it's because of my frizzy hair that I can't see it😭😭😭 I straightened my hair and then the uneveness is very visible now I'm going to go to her and get it fixed but seriously I lost so much length 😭😭😭 should've just done this butterfly cut by myself
I love Jenna! She makes great craft videos!
I followed the tutorial and I am obsessed! Thank you so much for the beautiful hair!
Oh how pretty it turned out. I just love love love you Brad. I love the energy you bring . I would love for you to do my hair . My niece was my hairdresser and she moved to New York. And I can't find a new one soooo.... Dunt duñt dunnnnn! I'm doing my own using your butterfly cut . Thank you sweetie you are amazing and beautiful. ❤❤❤❤
I love to see them but they just give me so much anxiety
Off topic on the video, but where did u get your sweatshirt i LOVE it!!
2 layer hair cut at home is what we need
OMG, Love you and your videos... but just noticed your X symbol... Is Elon M coming at you with some big checks or is it not considered an issue? Just curious!
Try hemp milk!
Jenna!!!!
A good 6 inches and 2 hairs 😅😂😅😂😂 💀
The still frames of the first girl crack me up. She's a pretty girl but the still frames capture her in the worst light. Lmao 😂
To life 👏 life 👏 life 👏 life 👏 life 🎶 😂❤
I appreciate you're tutorials so much. My mom is a hairdresser and barely has time to do my hair let alone actually puts time into my hair
I really don't enjoy going to the hairdresser, i'm never satisfied with the result and i feel like they don't get my hair goals. Paying close to 100£ for a haircut which will be styled in a way I didn't ask for, and have to make small talk with hairdressers which make me feel small, is genuinely not my vibe. Since covid i've been asking random friends to cut my hair and two of them followed your butterfly tutorial for it - it turned out PERFECT every time and i got to hang out with a friend in the meantime!!
As a  Hairstylist I'm not mad everyone should be guided on how to do their own hair. Salons are highly over priced. So u keep doing u my friend. I will be one of ur biggest fans .glad I found u on a fluke 😊❤🥂 Barbie
I want to do this hairstyle by myself but I’m so scared I’ll mess it up
9:27 can this cut work if you have a fringe?
Thank you so much Brad Mondo. From all of us who can't afford the hairdressers 🤩😍
Brad I did this haircut at home and I followed your video and all I can say it’s just WAW. I’m loving my hair and to be honest it looks fabulous so thank you thank you thank you🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
Brad, you are a hair god ❤
I did it! First time in 55 years cutting my own hair😊 thank you so much for this tutorial.
TRY MATCHA LATTE WITH COCONUT MILK ITS THE BEST I DONT DRINK MATCHA W ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT (jk I do matcha lemonade as well but that’s it) hehe
7:02 imagine being allergic to milk brad, try that one out I too exist on oatmilk and various green options
dawg like idk if you check these comments this late after posting this but i love your personallity so much like i wanna be friends with you so bad you are such a gorgeous goober
I don’t know why but brad mondo reminds my of arty from the movie cruella. I think it’s just the whole vibe he gives of with his style and everything, but I am loving it. I feel like he would be the irl version of arty from the cruella movie. But anyway I love your vibe brad you are awesome!
I am kinda mad he said Jenna Philips when it’s Jenna Phipps and I love her
Damn I’m about to do this now ahhahaha
I love Jenna and I was sure it was her from the thumbnail 😂 love it
Okay calm down people (hair dressers/barbers/stylists) brad isn’t encouraging people to cut their own hair 😂 he just knows that some people will cut their own hair REGARDLESS 😂 so might as well give them the proper tools
Soymilk,or almond milk for matcha I love almond milk.
if i did this my hair will be black then whe its dry it will be dark brown, what is the logic behind it?!
I did it and it look's good❤
almond milk
Can you do a butterfly cut if you have a straight fringe?
Thanks to you boo, these ladies transformed their hair and truly look amazing!!!! 🥹🫶🏽
I followed your wolf cut tut, I watched several others as well. I have to tell you, i always came back to yours. It came out really well! So thank for putting it out there - haters? Get a grip 😂
I've seen your around my socials for a while now and love watching when you pop up but finally subscribed today, and watching this video today finally gave me the courage to try it myself, I have long-ish thin hair and have wanted to do something with it for a while, but don't often have disposable income for a trip to the salon. I gave it a go finally today and while the top layers are a little shorter than I would normally go I am digging this style and love the fact that I was able to do it myself. I went from about under bust length (which is long for me) and took off about 7 inches from each ponytail, its now my favourite length of sitting just above the bust now. Thank you for putting this tutorial out there and giving everyone the chance to have a rocking haircut!
Oh Mylanta, dude, you saved me during the pandemic. I quarantined in a household with 7 long haired girls. 7. I could not handle taking all of us to a salon with covid restrictions. I loved your tutorials ❤
i feel like brad is always the most surprised when his cuts succeed lmao
*APRIL* DONT EVER DO THAT AGAIN” 💀😭
He said " I don't care where they go , but they can't stay on your hair
please do a tutorial of your makeup here
These hairdressers don’t understand that when we can’t afford it, we can’t afford it. I would much rather see my girl and get the full hand massage and warm peppermint scalp treatment and then sit back and let her do all the cutting, but times are tough rn. If we don’t cut our hair ourselves, we won’t cut it at all. We won’t default to an $85 haircut if we don’t have the $85 to spend. Do they think we shouldn’t be allowed to cut our own hair ever? Our own hair?!?
Thank you Brad ,really for sticking up for the consumer.i can't afford to get my five family members haircuts. Honestly my rent is almost 3000 grand a month electric water bills .yes all that it's 3000 grand. Then food phone bills wifi just life .and all the rest. Then yes it happens to me all the time getting bad uneven hair cuts so I stopped going to salons ten years ago .and the was like middle of the road to high end salons .hah .ok makes me nuts paying hundreds for what. N one hair dresser bleached my hair gray it was so gooey I saw in her face the panic and she was teaching students n goin to seminars teaching adults  .I was just going for blond and my hair is a medium brown. So I started watching a lot of hair dressers on YouTube and I can actually give a good hair cut .so thank you Brad your an Angel
i appreciate the tutorials because for some of us, going to the salon is just SO stressful. Ive never had a hair cutter listen to me, and I’ve only liked a couple haircuts Ive gotten. Ive been bullied for my odd hair texture and left crying. So now I basically just trim it myself always, and go in MAYBE once a year if I screwed something up.
just did a butterfly cut today. first time trying to give myself a hairstyle, and i think it turned out really well! i need to go at it with the thinning sheers tomorrow. but i'm hoping chopping some weight off will give it some body and bounce :)
4:37 i wish it was lies.. got tears in my eyes 😔😔
I did your tutorial I think I did pretty good
a hair dresser dealing with angry hair dressers? imagine a customer dealing with an angry hairdresser!! seriously I near terrified to go to a hair salon because I have just met nothing but meeaan hair dressers!!  liiiike I know why I'm there but why are YOU there lookin like you hate your job lmao
bro did her dirty with that pause 9:09
in my country i literally cannot get a haircut for less than $100  and so many times they screwed up, and last time i had to spend double that to have ot fixed at another shop.  youre a life saver ❤❤❤ im just never going to a hairdresser again. a good one will have me looking great, but there are too many salons and too many ppl pretending to be experts at shit they dont know, if i find a good one theyve moved on next time i come,  and i dont have the money to sus out a new good one every time😢   and im so tired of constantly being upsold and being charged out the nose for stuff that used to be included 🧐
Brad makes me want to cheat on my hairstylist her with myself and cut my own hair. I got this!
ok #1. How tf did youtube find this video- and #2. how long should your hair be for this haircut bc i want to try it bc my hair is very thick ive had a undercut my entire life after the age of 10. and right now my hair is to my shoulders so ive been wondering if that is long enough or if i should let it grow a little more
first girl looks like jewels
Yeah fxck these hating ass hairdressers I wanna become one but it’s hard finding someone who specializes in curly hair like mineeee so I understand everyone who do their own hair♥️
Brad does this work with long and thick hair?
April came out lookin like Farrah Fawcett. Absolute bombshell. During the start of covid, when a soft open of the country was ocurring, I had themisfortune of being one of the few who was allergic to the pfizer vaccine, so I had to wait to find out if I could do moderna instead for my booster. During that time, I couldn't go to the salon to get my hair cut cuz auto immune disorders and asthma were notfriendswith rona. You through one of your videos introduced me to the wolf cut, and one night at 3am, I was over my hair being long and split ended, I tried it. And that ledto me finding the cut that actually worked best with my thin but curly hair. So keep it up! You help ppl find their confidence through your videos and encourage us to be brave. And I think the world needs more of that.
My impulsive ass cannnoooottt wait to get into a hair stylist ok. We do it at home at 2am after only thinking about it obsessively the whole day.
I just followed the tutorial last night and i was so surprised at how good it came out!! I get a haircut maaaaybe once a year and I skipped it last year so it was much needed 😅
Oatmilk isn't that great for you, but if you're gonna do it, I would make it out of Bob reds mill oats. You're probably allergic to the additives and pesticides. I hope your tummy is doing better ❤
Jenna being is this video is a full circle moment
I cut myself a bob about a month ago and now I think I’m gonna try and do this butterfly cut but with my short hair. It will take a little improvisation but I’ve been cutting my own hair for almost two years thanks to your videos 🥹💗 thank you for reaching us how to slay
Mondo, will you please do a styling how-to video? I always wear my hair in a ponytail or bun because I really don't know how to style it. Heeeeeelp please.🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Almond milk?
To heck with the hairdressers!  If I could find one that actually cut my hair as I request I might actually go to one.
Im currently pregnant with my second child and i want to cut my dead ends off before i have the baby. But my hair is finally getting so long and i dont want to lose a lot of length. So ive been thinking about doing this cut cause i have wavy/curlyish hair and layers are my best friend. Im just so scared that SOMEHOW im gonna mess it up 🥲
Slay, Brad! Thank you!
Brad just had a hairdresser hair-gasm 😂😂😂😂
The first time I saw Brad was today, he had  Grey or white hair, and looked so AWSOME..  Beautiful complexion and perfect            eyebrows.  So cute!
Brad you're awesome and I appreciate all your advice and tips and hair cutting tutorials. pay no mind to the haters. not everyone can afford a good hairdresser
Just wanted to let you know I tried this and it came out good!! I didnt listen and I did on my dry straightened hair but it came together lol ❤
I wanted a curtain bang I did kinda get it but it looks like a butterfly cut when I brush it out explain AND THIS VIDEO WAS MADE 2 MONTHS AGO BUT. ADE ON MY BDAY
i remember that you made me want to get curtain bangs and i did it with random scissors and it was not the best but my mom made me go get it cleaned up and the hair dresser was like "its that not bad " and said it i ever did it agian to get scissors that are meant for hair and she asked what youtube video i watched and i said brad mondo and she said "thats usally the answer we get" but  tbh i dont regret a thing
Brad: Jenna Philips!  Me: hmm looks like he added an “L” in there…
I have been cutting my own hair for 15 years lol
@brad mondo as someone who has had my hair royally screwed up many times by hairdressers, I’d rather mess it up myself
Brad, you are a beautiful human being. I see your empathy for people, how silly and fun you are. Keep being you. I appreciate you. ❤️
Hairstylist here… My personal opinion, butterfly cuts look whack when they are not styled. Personally, I love you so much and you actually end up stacking our money bags because corrections are where the real money is at. Keep doing you because you are only doing good in this world!
Can you help me do a slamming short super a symmetrical? I can dye my hair and do quite a few cuts but this one makes me nervous
39 years old and I did this.  Took a good 6-7 inches off and it came out amazing.
No one better come for Brad!  Lord take the wheel if you do!  This man is helping multiple women around the world that can’t always afford Salon prices. Brad is simply beautiful.💜🖤💜
I really wanna try it. But im afraid because my hair is very long, like to my waist, and thick. All i do is put it up in clips.
I need a tutorial for going from long hair to a very short shaggy hair. Nearly a pixie.   I have dense wavy hair and it's HOT and HEAVY.  If I can't find a quality tutorial video I'm about to be featured in a hairdresser reacts fail video bc I can't stop this impulse thought.
As for the oat milk allergy, maybe try, cashew milk, also i heard if you are allergic to a certain food  or milk, you can take a small amount each day for 14 days a tablespoon each day. On the 15th day try a little more 1/4 cup of the oat milk see how that goes. The doctor claims, your body will stop being allergic to it. Then you can try the amount that you normally consumed. Good luck love your videos, you helped me cut my own hair many times. Came out really nice. Maybe try showing a above the shoulder bob. You are awesome
Almonds milk, milk, half and half
😂😂 "I feel I'm a hairdresser now that I've watched ONE of Brad's  tutorials".. took me out 😂😂 Don't get me wrong,  they're coming out great so far
“It’s six inches and two hairs.” Hahaha
Ok. That's it. I am doing it.
im cutting my hair while watching this video and i should have taken a video
Thank you for helping us Brad some people can't afford hair dressers and your tutorials help lots people feel better about ourselves so much love to you ❤ Try almond milk
Ok.. Honest question.. Will this work on long thick wavy hair?? Will I end up with shelves or stair steps on the back of my head?? Help!
Hi I’m so DONE WITH MY HAIR and I’m 15 and I want to see if I’m should  do your Butterfly cut tutorial But But but but I have short Hairs in front of my eyes and I’m wondering if I should just go for it  😅
So I decided to follow Brad's tutorial and it was AMAZING. My hair was so long and getting unmanageable, it had been about a year and half since I last cut it since I had a baby and mom life just consumed me. But I needed to chop those ends and I needed a refreshing change. It came out so good and I feel so much better about how I look. So THANK YOU BRAD! 💕
I love watching your videos I’ve been cutting my own hair since I was 13 because my hairdresser literally snipped my ear🥲 but ever since I’ve watched you my hair is doing so much better dying wise and hair cutting wise
I don't go to hair dressers cause they don't listen. Because I am over 40, they always cut it to look like Rachael. Chunky a-line, Rachel, ragged layers, Rachel, bleach it, Rachel. Why, Friends is an old show, just cause I am old I don't want it. I mean if I mess it up, then I can take the 80$ I was going to pay and buy ice cream.
I don't usually comment but just wanted to address hairdressers in the comments: More people wouldn't stop going to hairdressers if it wasn't outside our means on top of a lot of people getting shit cuts (mostly the shit cuts, I've heard this a lot).
I think hairstylists better chill out- as a curly haired girl who was constantly let down by the haircuts I've received from stylists (I'm sorry, how do so many not realize what "shrinkage" is and i leave lookin like shirley temple...) I've been cutting my own curls for years, never looked better lol. No more triangle shaped hair😅😂😂
try to take Lomenade to get rid of the Macha addiction
Hey Brad, would you do a cut your own hair tutorial with the wig on yourself rather than on the mannequin? That would be more accurate to follow, and quite fun too! 🤩
Well I just finished cutting my own hair....and too shy to video it but I followed your tips after watching a ton of videos..... thank you Brad.... I've never been to a salon/hair dresser. Family and my beastie did mine forever. Besides $ I just don't feel comfy in a salon so I've never done it.  Mom of 5 who is starting over this cut felt amazing now I gotta change the color.  Anyways that's for those who get mad, ....not everyone can get professional hair care,  ❤
Hey Brad Mondo community😃Does the butterfly hair cut works on a straight heavy thick hair? If that make sense🤔 Thx for your answers!
if I ever encounter a hairdresser that can cut curly/wavy hair without cutting of 5 inches I'll go there sure
Bahaha the comment about angry hairdressers made my love you even more 😂❤ tell ‘em Brad!
Brad is like the perfect best friend.
10:15 had to replay it cuz I laughed so loud
“Jenna PHILIPPS” I CANNTTT 😭😭😭😭 I’m sorry 😂😂😂🥲🥲🥲😭😭😭😭😭😭😭it’s PHIPPS 1:42 😭😭😭
He has a really nice singing voice BUT WHY IS YOUTUBE HERE?!?!!?
I did this haircut at home. I love it! It turned out so great! Thanks Brad❤
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 thank you soooo much for doing a video with this cut in those who have thin/fine hair.
I did the butterfly haircut yesterday and used a qtip to measure 😭
Yall i asked the hairdresser for a butterfly cut and i think it looks good but the bangs are kinda uneven in length and thickness  do i need to fix it??
Little Sus intro but try not to take those rude ahh hairdressers seriously.
I did the butterfly cut and it didn’t work I did it exactly as it showed but it didn’t work can someone tell me why?
Not the hairdressers mad 😭 ig they’re going out of business Brad lmaooo
My name is Nicole and when he said nicole what’s up I thought he was talking to me😢
Are you high?
Thank you so much❤
thanks for teaching us haircuts, sorry abt the haters ❤️❤️❤️
1:16 had me dyin"!! I love your videos. Only you could pull off critiquing someone and not make them feel stupid. You simultaneously give great tips as well. Keep em coming I love you and your videos!!!
Brad you look sooooo coooool today👍
Awesome 😎
After years of paying too much $$$ for hair styles that didn't really work for my thick hair, I discovered Brad's vids and now I love my hair. ❤❤❤ This butterfly cut was what I've been searching for. I even learned to use thinning shears properly so I can manage my hair better.
I love your videos!!! Thank youuu for making me look banging for literally 0 costs! Hairdressers are just jelly. You do you babe ❤
Did that cut and my curls just appered agiain and I get so much compliment about my hair😊😊😊
Whats the diffrens between a butterfly and a wolf cut?
I can't curl my hair but I cut it and love it in a very very similar way to this... two ponytails, but then flatten it and cut at a sharp angle. I was taught by a hair stylist who thought broke ass bitches should have good hair too. the straight across looks so weird to me. but it's the only difference. and I do less hair in the front cause I like my bangs whispyyyyy
I've not been to the hairdresser for over 4 years. They're so fake. And expensive. Freedom. ❤
Brad, you not only saving me money and time, you gave me freedom and power to have a control over my hair and make me feel good about myself. Your tutorials and work are greatly appreciated, I would rather pay you for giving me freedom and power, rather than those angry hairdressers who don’t have the heart and skill set to make me look at my best!
You should do a mondo makeover on Nicol!!!
Wow! The second girl! Amazing, and what is that hair curler she is using?? Dope.
cs why did I think Jesus was on your shirt
I love Nicole
Now I want to get a butterfly cut 🤣😆
I started cutting my own hair after constantly getting bad cuts from stylists who didn't understand what a 'shag' haircut was.
I like my haircut so much more now lol
ALMOND MILK FTW!!! vanilla almond milk to be precise ❤
I need to see this on a bob style NOW
Fr people are gonna do it at home regardless why not have the tools?
I did my own hair with your tutorial and I got so many compliments and I loved it, I should do it again lmao
I feel a strange urge to do a butterfly cut now ...
Brad, try almond milk!
We love you Brad ❤
I just F’N love you so much! I did this cut on my hair two days ago and it came out amazing! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! :-)
Brad!❤ I am also allergic to oat milk. I feel your pain!
I JUST LOVE THESE VIDEOS 😂
the first girly lowkey reminds me of Jules
The Bo noise he made talking about how high the pony tail should be hilarious
Weird seeing you one of my fav youtuber watch one of my other fav youtuber
Soo I just tried this last night, in the middle of the night on a weekday before a trip. LOOOL. Fully prepared to mess it up and go to a salon. However- it turned out great, I love it! I have fine coarse hair past chest length. For the forehead unicorn portion where you place it in-between eyebrows I first tried 4 inches but ended up cutting to a bit under chin length so maybe 2-3 more inches more. You really do need to cut off a lot. The back pony portion - I cut 4-5 inches. I had to blend it out as well but overall very good! I would definitely recommend and use again in the future. Just make sure you follow his directions exactly and look at a few videos of others doing it too.
Brad use coconut milk. :)
If you're a hairdresser that got mad at Brad (or anyone) for helping people give themselves better at home haircuts - sit the eff down. It is not taking away from your business, you will still have people coming in with messed up haircuts that you need to fix. And at home dye-jobs you have to correct, in addition to your other cuts and whatnot you have to do. Him helping a few thousand people is fine. It's not a fragile industry - it's gonna be fine.
I love the butterfly🦋haircut. I learned how to do it by watching videos on Facebook, then I saw your videos on how to do the butterfly🦋haircut and now I can do it really well😊
When Brad says "Imagine being allergic to oat milk." and I'm sat here like, dude, I'm gluten, wheat and lactose intolerant. 😂
Unless someone shows actual data showing videos like these harm hairdresser's business, I find it hard to believe it. I'd say most people cutting their hair at home don't go to a hairdresser regularly, if at all. I can't afford hundreds of $ on a haircut, so I'd get one haircut a year because I had to. And when I did, the haircut wasn't bad but it was never exactly what I wanted. My hair looked good enough for a few weeks and then I'd wear it in a ponytail the rest of the year. Now I can make my hair look nice all year round, and I'm more excited to experiment with my looks. Maybe one day I'll even splurge on colouring! (at the hairdresser haha my hair is very dark and I don't think dare bleach it at home.)
I did the butterfly cut after watching your video…. I love it! Always get compliments on my hair 😘
i wonder how they look unstyled tho
I just love your videos.
Yeah.  I can see why hair dresses hate you 😂
I dont think the hairdressers are all upset because you're taking away business, I think a lot of them probably get upset because you're providing tutorials to people who cant even follow basic directions like use hair scissors and wet your hair. Then when they mess up they  have to deal with the consequences. But such is life. The internet has led people to believe their experts in everything.
The last time I cut my own hair, it turned out to be garbage. I don't have the time to go to a salon, so tried the diy again and I was sooo nervous! Just followed your instructions and tried the butterfly haircut. I have wavy hair that curls at the end but gave it a go anyway cause YOLO. I am not a professional and I did mess up here and there while cutting, but the haircut actually turned out AMAZING. So Thank you, Brad! You are a saviour _/\_
Brad Mondo's reaction literally killed me on that last hair cut. He was bend over in shock  .😂😂😂
Its a good 6 inches and 2 hairs 😂😂😂😂😂😂
You can try soy milk with your matcha instead😩usually I hate soy milk but to my surprise it tastes great w matcha
This is purely propaganda to go make me cut my hair right now...  (It's working)
I can't curl my hair but that's cause i never do but I'm great at cutting my own hair
Bought your turquoise dye for my fav barista….she loved it, watch Slim on the inside, her hair dye videos are hysterical
Now this is motivating me to cut my hair and I think by Tomarrow the hair on my head will be different.
damn. big bummer for you brad. oatmilk is life.
As a hairstylist Brad, I’ve always loved you and always will. I will never give you hate I strive to do what you do an educate the general public some people can’t afford to get their hair done and it’s good. That hairdressers can give the best insight on what to do. It’s about money for hairstylist. I feel like some hairstylist feel like you may be stealing your clients because you’re teaching them to do it at home the same way we do well that is true. You know that’s not the whole picture I find.
Thank you so much for not gatekeeping hair styling information/education!! Not everyone can afford to go to salons, but everyone deserves to feel confident in themselves and present the way that makes them happy! You’re a king 🥰
There's obviously a reason women don't go to hairdressers. I refuse to go anymore. I went wanting layers and the girl told me she couldn't do layers because my hair was too fine. I have fine hair, but a LOT of it. And this is after having it done before by other people. Other salons will just color my hair random colors when I bring a picture. Good hairdressers are hard to find, so why not learn it yourself to save yourself the stress. Thank you, Brad, for these tips and tutorials.
I will have to look at the original tutorial video. Thanks Brad ❤ Your videos help so many people, and although subscribed for years, none of your videos have appeared on my YouTube suggestions for ages. I'm extremely grateful that this one appeared. I have a lot of Brad videos to catch up with 😊   My hair is very long and extremely fine, like the second ladies. It will NOT sit in a centre parting, but always reverts to a squiggly line that ends off three quarters of the way to one side. If I initially cut it with a straight front parting, won't bits at the very front of the parting, that need to be longer to get three quarters of the way accross my skull,  now be far too short when it sits as it pleases? Perhaps I will keep it long, cutting straight first, then tidying up when it goes to its normal position 😊  I was very lucky and could afford to have my hair highlighted and professionally cut/coloured for more than 30 years of my life. I am now disabled and like many people, VERY VERY poor, particularly with the cost of living crisis. Two weeks in the month I mainly eat plain, boiled rice, as I can't afford anything else, so a haircut is an undreamed of luxury. I have not had my hair cut in a salon for about 7 years, and with the colour being totally different from my lifelong blonde, even though it's been years, I still wonder who the ugly, old, dark haired lady staring back at me in the mirror is, lol.
I feel like this really only works on hair on the thinner side. If I did this without thinning shears I would have literal shelves on my head
I did this earlier in the week and I just love it, thanks Brad <3
"it's a good 6 inches and about 2 hairs." 🤣🤣🤣 Omg I cracked up! Lol
My husband insists I go to a hairstylist and I have a good one,but I want to put myself through this Rollercoaster 😭😭😭😂
This is going to be my new regular for cutting my hair while homesteading ❤
Thank u so much I love my hair now I cutter bangs and died it purple and black 🖤 it's awesome thank u so much love yaa
I followed this tutorial too, not drunk but exhausted at 1 am in my bathroom, and it's bomb. for someone with literally no skills and an inability to do anything in the mirror, it still worked!
“It’s about 6 inches and 2 hairs” LMAO
Sorry but I followed your tutorial twice, for bleaching and cuts, well damn now my hair is beautifully vibrant-iee blue and the layers are fabs!!! Thank you your honor for your tutorials!!!🤣🫶
I followed your butterfly cut tutorial. I was really happy with the way it turned out.
I love the at home tutorials for hair cutting. I cut my kids' hair at home. The salon is way too noisy.
One thing I’ve noticed when I get my haircut is stylist always ask how do u normally style your hair and it’s like some of us don’t do our hair bc it looks the same every day, so when we ask for layers it’s bc we want to curl our hair and do different stuff than we normally do and a lot of hair stylist don’t understand that. A fresh new look will allow me to do my hair more than I did before, and try new hairstyles now that I changed my look
I really wish I would have done it before and after of mine because I literally cut off at least 9 in and it was the fastest haircut I've ever done. It took less than 5 minutes and it's the best haircut I've ever had. Thank you, Brad Mondo
Hairdressers give you hate because they can't cut hair to start with! Out here in New Mexico, if I ask for layers I get the "Karen."   51 yrs old, I did this cut and I love my hair again! It took years off, too. Before the cut people guessed my age around 45. After it, I had someone guess my age at 39!  My hair is so thick and heavy that layers are essential to having anything that doesnt look like I'm related to an afghan hound.  Best part for me, the layers brought out the curls that tend to get dragged out with the length.  So yeah, if hairdressers who give you hate could learn how to cut hair, you wouldn't  have so many people doing this!
Try coconut milk.  It’s supposed to be healthier than oat or almond milk.  I love your videos Brad! 😂
I don't care for oat milk so I use cashew or macadamia milk. I'll use almond in a pinch. I hope you can find a suitable alternative. If you're allergic to oatmilk you may be reacting to one of the thickeners, etc, esp. if you can tolerate oatmeal. Different brands of milk have different thickeners.
I am not allergic to oatmilk per se but I had discomfort with all the plant based milks and it was from the "gums" that are in there. I found out they are offering a oatmilk with only 4 ingredients (no gums) and now I can drink it again without problems 😁 check for oatmilk with less ingredients
Brad, thank you- I’m so grateful for you! Cutting hair is not in my wheelhouse, but your butterfly cut video is so spot on, even I have an amazing hair cut. I can no longer afford a salon cut. There’s a lot of hair all over the bathroom, and unfortunately, a lot of blood- geez those scissors are sharp!🩸 No worries if I lose a finger, my hair is smokin hot! 💕
Lol!  Your squirrel ran off with the tea😂😂😂
Trader Joe’s has a good matcha tea mix in a canister. I brew a regular cup of green tea & add a few spoonfuls of the mix. Tastes jus like any coffeehouse
I love that first one! I’m about to watch the other person or people on this video. You have the wolf cut tutorial I needed to refresh my hair, so thank you!
My hair is too short but I want to do this 😭
All the haircuts turned out awesome! I know the anxiety cutting your own hair causes. I have curly hair and always wet to the salon to get my hair cut until Brad showed us how to do it ourselves. First time I cut my hair, I had to take a deep breath after each cut 😂
Matcha made with almond milk
I did it and with some small cleaning up afterwards it looked really good!
not jenna being in a brad mondo video lolol
I genuinely am better at cutting my hair than curling it I feel like, it’s always been a struggle 😭🤣
I tried to do the wolfcut and damn it went wrong BECAUSE I DIDNT DO YOUR TUTORIAL =(
Can we talk about those finger cuffs Brad is wearing? Rings? They're amazing! I need one.
All I kept saying at the first reveal was “OH MY GOD” she looks so good!!!
I ALMOST have the courage to do this!  Frankly, my hair couldn't look worse, so I don't know what I'm worried about....  Thanks for showing us how, Brad!
Omggg Brad. Was waiting for another butterfly cut review. Been thinking of doing it. But idk if it'll look good without styling my hair hair. That's why been holding back. But keep making these videos. Tey are so fun and entertaining
*Choperoni the pony* 😂
The third girls hair is so full !!!
Second girl: She looks sooo Sexy !!
Edit: The first girl: She did that so good !! Can you cut my hair !!! My hair is superfine also !!
I used to work at Sally's and you taught me so much that they never did. I helped so many people with their hair because of you and it feels so crazy watching you again now.
Okay -all of these girls have thin hair and it. looks BEAUTIFUL on them. I have SUPER thick hair and im in desperate need of a trim, im just nervous it will come out different on my really thick hair. Anyone know if it works on thick hair too?
The intro YASSSS 👏❤️‍🔥 literally no matter what field you're in (I'm in dietetics for reference) someone in you're field will always have something to say about your philosophy, approach, opinion etc. Always remind yourself that and so happy you're back 🥲❤️‍🔥
Addicted to oatmilk matchas also! Annnnnnd im allergic as well. Theres a great probiotic thats been helping me. So sad. So very sad.
I wanna try this. Lolol famous last words on the internet
🥰my crocheting queen jenna and braddd??
Hey Brad, or anybody else who might have an idea. I got curly think hair and I merge a butterfly and shag cut for my hair but I end up with a thick heavy under layer that is weighing my curls down to waves. Any ideas to fix?
brad try milkadamia!!! it's too creamy and yummy
kinda want to try this with my head being half shaved and see how it turns out
now I'm gonna do it........I have the motivation to do it now. might f it up....
I waited a week since seeing this to do. I was scared. I finally did the cut and took off 6 inches and I love it!!!!!
Wait your allergic to oatmilk? i thought being allergic to oats was impossible. Oatmilk is all I drink now! And I couldn’t live without my matcha’s! Try a different plant based milk? 😮
As a two time beauty school drop out, I appreciate all your tips and tricks. I do my own hair and have been successfully for about 11 years now, and it's mostly due to you 9:34 r vids. So thank you 🙏
I am watching all of these videos to give myself the courage to try it. Have been cutting my hair straight across for years because professional hairdressers ALWAYS cut one side shorter than the other, and I’d have to come home and fix it myself. But giving myself layers? This makes me 😬
Brad I did a butterfly hair cut & it worked for me too! 😊🎉💕
I love cutting my own hair since I found out about unicorn method. I used to be so anxious when I went to the hair salon because they would cut SO MUCH MORE than I asked them.. this way I can cut as much as I want, plus I have wavy hair so mistakes are not that noticeable.
I remember i did wolf cut watching your video. I was so happy. It became my go to haircut because it's easy to do and honestly i feel pretty in that haircut. Last I went to a salon before covid in 2018. Whenever I went to a salon, seeing my wavy-curly hair, they are always like no cuts will suit you. It used to be so boring. It's always u cuts and even if they cut layers it was not smooth or distinct. Then last year i went to salon again (i shouldn't have) for a haircut (thought maybe the experience will be different) and man, it was so bad. I can't stress enough. They gave me layers and took so much money but again end up giving a sloppy cut.. It just can't satisfy me anymore. I gave myself wolf cut again last week and it feels so good.. not going to any salon anymore. Thanks Brad ❤
Jenny Philips is the name of the lady who created my school curriculum😑
I used a stick of deodorant to measure my hair when I did this cut. I couldn't find a ruler anywhere🤷‍♀
You are the best Brad! I have huge anxiety about going to hairdressers and without all your help and tutorials I’d be lost! Thank you and don’t let the haters get to you! ❤
I have only gone to a salon 2 times my whole life and both times they fucked it up. I just do it myself.
cashew milk over oat milk 💜
The butterfly cut/blowout saved my color eaten curls. I transitioned it into a mullet 😊 ty Brad
I don’t think u have an oatmeal allergy I just think you’re having too much like cholesterol or wtv it is. I worked coffee and a lady couldn’t have it bc it affected her type 1 diabetes so check in on it :)
As a hairdresser for ten years, who recently stepped away, imo you're doing something WONDERFUL! We're all human, and we all probably cut our own hair at home! Even my regulars would trim their bangs in between, and I would ALWAYS give people advice, cuz if they're going to do it anyway, might as well equip them with the knowledge to keep them from giving themselves dumb and dumber micro bangs 😂 Bless you Brad, cuz some people forget there are others with health and mental health problems that could keep them inside for extended periods, and they deserve to feel good about themselves, too 💚
I worked in a salon as a nail tech for years & let me tell you guys I have seen a ton of people come in all excited &nervous to get a new cut style only to see them leave in tears,,yea all you licensed stylist that should be working doing anything but hair! you know who you are don't you,,hmmm thank goodness for professionals like Brad who are talented & know how to rock a head of hair AND SHOW US HOW TO DO A DO AT HOME!! LOVE HIM! THANKS TO YOU BRAD MONDO,,I SALUTE YOU! GREAT JOB! THANK YOU! CONFETTI ALL OVER THE PLACE,,,peace out
Brad! I love your videos you taught me so much! Can I ask a couple questions about butterfly cuts? 1) does it work if normally my hair is parted on the side 2) does it work if I already have some face framing?
“It’s a good 6 inches and about two hairs” I’m done! 😂😂
You know - Nobel prizes are awarded for bringing peace and benefit to the masses ; so thank you Brad Mundo for helping us and our bank balances : ) Keep up your charismatic curations 🎉😊
I so appreciate your tutorials, Brad. Personally, I don't dig going to a salon. I don't like being touched by strangers, plus the fake jibber jabbering about my life... like they care about me when they see me once every few months & don't remember anything from before anyway... doesn't do it for me. Plus, I have chronic illnesses and cannot sit still in those chairs with my legs & feet how they want them for an even cut, and the A/C isn't good for me. I don't mean to offend anyone, but cutting & coloring my hair at home is where it's at for me.
Use Almond/Coconut milk blend from silk for your matcha
I love Jenna so it’s really funny to see her here 💜
Love the butterfly sweater for a video about the butterfly cut.
Oh my goodness ❤❤❤ I love you Brad!!!
I’ve been cutting my own hair years before I found your tutorial, your tutorial just made it easier and nicer so those hairstyles get lost. (If I had gone to the hairstylist they were gonna charge me $200 because of the amount of hair I have. Ummmm screw that….Brad mondo helped me for free!🫶🏼)
Okayyyy, haven’t even finished watching yet but lemme just say…ITS ABOUT DAMN TIME YOU STOOD UP FOR YOURSELF!!!! I hate seeing people try to tear you down when you’re just trying to be genuine. I’m honestly soooo proud of you! I get where hairdressers are coming from but not everyone has the means to go to a hairdresser and they shouldn’t have to feel less beautiful because of that.
I'd love to see Brad work more with curly hair....keep up the great work Brad! 😊
How do I cut around a small cow lick in my left side of bangs.
Hey Brad, when will you come out with a brunette hair color line, for those of us that want a fresh wash of color to give us dimension, make our hair healthy and glossy, and cover those stressful grays? I NEED a Brad Mondo deep brown color 😩😭🙏🏼💜
Hi, does anyone know what kind of Haircurler she uses at 13:13 ?
Here's the thing about the angry hairdressers: if you're the kind of person who is going to cut your own hair and doesn't want to go to a salon (whether it's anxiety or income or whatever), you're going to do it anyway! Brad showing how to DIY it isn't taking away from hairdressers because the DIY person wouldn't have gone to them anyway. I love watching tutorials but I'm just the kind of person who would rather go to a hairdresser. There's nothing wrong with either! It's like landscape designers complaining about gardening shows or builders complaining about home improvement videos. If someone's going to go to a professional, they're going to go to a professional no matter what tutorials they see - and if they're not, they won't.
Ok so I was Watching this video and my 2 year old daughter heard the noise you made when moving hair and she copped it hahahahah she loves to watch your videos woth me and I just have to add in there I myself am a hair dresser I just don't work in a salon lol
I freaking love you so much you are amazing🖤
I just freaking love you and your videos!!! Thank you for being great! - also love your products too ❤
Also has more protein
Soy milk
brad, you're honestly so real. your videos always make my night <3
What the heck is the hair tool the second girl is using
Part 2 pleaseeeee i really injoyed watching those i would love to see more ( even fails )
i think all the mental health peeps agree we are gonna cut our hair, regardless of there being a tutorial or not
“It’s about 6 inches & 2 hairs “😂😂
Brad!!   Language !
Who elses jaw dropped when April pulled her hair?
Brad Mondo, where do I have to go for you to cut or color my hair? I'm not allowed to do it myself and I've never had good experiences with hair stylists. I don't care how much it costs where do I gotta go for you? Id let you freestyle do whatever you think would look best for me just tell me where 😅
Try Almond milk or soya milk. X
Coconut milk is also a good substitute. ❤
Did mine 3 months ago (and the wolf even before that) - came out amazing!! Getting ready to redo but hit your chan first to see if there were any new style tutorials. I love the butterfly so much tho that I am fine keeping it foooooeeeeevvvva. lol oxo
Not me sitting here with my fine and thin hair thinking I can do this successfully but not trusting myself enough 🥲
It honestly doesnt make sense that they point you out and blame you like there arnt 70 thousand other hair tutorials out there. Like if someones gonna fuck their hair up its gonna happen whether they watch yours or any one elses video. Blows my mind. At least your trying to make sure people will have success
хуже аллергии на овсяное молоко, только непереносимость лактозы 😅
So I have some questions about the butterfly cut or something similar. I want to get my hair cut. I have long hair and don’t want to take more than a few inches off the length just yet. But I wear my hair in a side part that I really like and and too scared to make the transition to a middle part. Got any ideas?
In Brad Mondo we TRUST 🖖
I do coconut milk with my matcha latte.
am I the only one thinking the first girl kinda looks like Hunter Schafer?
Salons are expensive as hell I'd rather Brad be responsible for my appearance for the next six months for free
I want to see the girl with the silver hair to all dark. I feel like she’d look so hot.
So funny. Hahaha.
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
I'm extremely disabled and bed bound due to social worker negligence not sorting out my care.  My Nan died in Jan and with no care I hadn't had a proper wash for 3 months and my hair was a matted mess. My DARLING neighbours took 2 days teasing and combing it out for me... We managed to get me in the longest bath ever to relax my muscles as much as possible b4 she washed hair for me and then following the butterfly tutorial with me directing to make sure sections and pony's in right place. Then I could just about move shoulders enough to do the actual cuts.  I managed to not even need to do any cuts to connect it, was just right... But I did a bit more face framing with some over direction cutting.    Thanks to YOU wonderful gorgeous brad. I may not have had my normal rainbow hair for ages, but I looked like a styled actual human for my Nans funeral.  And neighbour loved mine so much she washed her hair sat on floor in front of me so I could reach and I did her hair as well.  Love you Brad 💕 so glad Ur back 💕
I just did this cut and wow.  Thankyou 🥹
youre such a beautiful soul
look at the ingredients list on your oatmilk, if it has canola oil, rapeseed oil, or sunflower oils that could be causing your problems not the oats themselves. Large amounts of these can cause problems. Also not all oatmilks are gluten free (idk if your gluten free) hope this helps
first girl looked like jules from euphoria
Me wanting this but at the same time I’m the person who would have a dramatic break down if it did not turn out well 😃
Brad, you are a glowing, glittering breeze of goodness and wholesomeness. I love you so much and I've been really going through it lately, so thank you for making me laugh every damn day. I really owe you. Stay awesome! ❤
https://youtube.com/shorts/CGbuQTdsHd4?feature=share  what do u recon t this  petal ?
9:09 her Face!🤣😂
I'm sending regards from Poland. Ur channel is awesome, great job.
**Follow the steps**...  that is the key   to a great butterfly cut!  Thanks Brad for show us home hair cutters an easy, cute style.
Followed the technique Brad showed in his demo video and the butterfly cut came out quite nice on my long hair,  getting some length off first brings out the effect of the cut, I love it!!!  I had to cut about 7 inches off .
Don’t apologize for helping so many people who struggle in different ways to get to a salon!
If going to the hairstylist was an option I was going to entertain, I wouldn't be in my bathroom at 3am watching this video, now would I? Tell me I'm pretty and watch me fuck this shit up cuz that's all I want.   Also love you Brad <3.
Butterfly cuts give anime mom energy
I think curly hair or adding waves to layers makes that cut blend alot better
The shrinkage of curls is real !!!!!!!
So how about I missed you and your vids. I hope you were able to relax and absorb your time away 💜.
I'm someone that you would never see in your salon. I have a short natural style that we older black women have to embrace. Recently, I gave up on barbers and hair dressers and have found the freedom in cutting my own hair! Thank God, inadvertently watching you advise them to cut their own hair, so have I, and it is VERY simple!!
Brad you are so funny and I truly hope you can drink oat milk again cause oat matcha lattes are so good. 💞
I just gave myself this cut after seeing this video, and I LOVE IT! Its really easy and really flattering!  I've cut my hair into a wolf cut based on another video of yours, but I could never really blend in the side, and now it's great! Thank you so much!
I am so scared right now. My hair is too heavy and it weighs down my waves as well as it hurts my neck. I want to keep my length but get layers so I hope this works out for me!
Can you please do a tutorial on how to cut layers for curly & wavy hair?
I so appreciate you i wanted an easy way to layer my hair and I did this to my hair and it was so easy and my hair looks great.
Brad love the hair and brows!
I went to the hairdressers once and they couldn’t stop talking about you not in a negative way they were talking about how you inspired them and recommended your channel to the clients
I’m loving this new baddie Brad energy I’m obsessed 😂
HEY MR BRAD MONDO... YOU'RE AWESOME & I WILL EVENTUALLY TRY YOUR PRODUCTS😜... WELL I'VE ALWAYS HATED ANYONE CUTTING MY HAIR SO I STARTED DOIN' IT MYSELF ABOUT 25 YEARS AGO IN A VERY SIMILAR FASHION & I LOVE THAT YOU TAUGHT THE WORLD HOW TO DO IT 😁✌️
I’m allergic to Oatmilk too😢 I use almond milk and an almond milk creamer to achieve the same viscosity of Oatmilk and/or whole milk  since I’m allergic to both
LOL I watch you always 💕but I’m over here with hair passed my bum and it’s all one length 🫣
No literally I got my hair done and I brought you up just trying to make small talk and she dogged your life I was omg lmfao let him live
omg jenna!!!!❤❤❤❤
4:36 isn't that, Unwise. Would've been a good end there. But anyways back to the video lol
Hi Brad my husband copied the butterfly cut on my hair and we were so pleased so thank you so much, I've been to so many hair dressers for layer's to done but it's like they were scared or something I was so disappointed and now I'm 60 I've got the perfect haircut lot's of love jacky from Oxford uk xx 💕✨
i need your hoodie and i’ve been searching for it the last hour with no results 😜
Brad turned into scooter (the purple surfer fish) from SpongeBob at the end 😂
Brad is to hair stylists as life coaches are to licensed therapists. 😂
To hell with the haters Brad, we love you!   When you think about it tho, hairdressers overcharge to fuck up ur hair or not do it right the first time (but not always) an my point to all this is, if people learn to diy then people will quit dishing out outrageous amounts of money for hair colors and etc. To much cash for a cut and color kinda sucks the whole point of it being a luxury when prices go up but wages do not....anyways enough of that rambling lol. Be strong Brad, ur smart, handsome, and have a great personality.  You got this! 🎉❤😘
I just dyed my hair using the super pink and lime xmondo hair dye, hopefully It works out 🤞 I’ve never used two hair dyes, nor have I used the lime one. I do have to say I love the hair dyes! They’re very vibrant for me because I don’t let them sit for the full 30 minutes as I have pretty dark hair, I did bleach it but only half of the hair so I didn’t damage it too much 😅
the last one does have natural curly hair and you did say not to cut "to much" cause it bounces back up shorter so i think that natural curl came out in the blow out
I moved to another country years ago and haircuts are something that's been giving me so much anxiety. I went to the hairstylist after a lot of gathering of courage and making sure I knew all the complicated hair words and terms and got insulted and hit with the "I've never seen hair quality like this before I don't know what to do" by the stylist. Your tutorials help so much ❤
I love how you committed to the video by wearing a butterfly hoodie.
btw i followed your tutorial and it came out great:D
You can make your own oat milk quite easily. I’m guessing you may be intolerant to an additive in the shop bought oat milk. Hope you work it out! 🤞
Ok but where’s the hoodie from??! 😭😍😍
Just wanted to say that i hope You’re well, Brad ❤️ love your videos as always, and love u!!
Maybe try other vegan milks? Soy? Rice? etc? Sorry about the oatmilk, I practicly live on the stuff for my tea <3
Wat if you have bangs
I followed your butterfly cut tutorial and I think it looks pretty good 😭
Coconut milk + matcha = ❤
I fucked up doing my own bangs and I refuse to go to the hairdresser. 🤣 Like I'm letting them grow a bit and then cut then, and I plan on doing this until I get them right.
I did your wolf cut on my 13yr old and it came out sooo good!
I haven't had a haircut in over a year (since the birth of my second child) and your tutorial is going to allow me to cut it myself when my kids are asleep ❤
Try a different brand of oat milk! Some make my stomach hurt
I can't afford to visit my usual stylist rn & refuse to waste money on a cut I'll have to fix myself afterward. Thank you for your tutorials 💜
I have no leftover money after bills to get my hair done at a salon, and your videos have given me the confidence to cut my own hair!!! THANK YOU 🙏 I LOVE my butterfly cut!
Apex part there" pull forward and chop about 3-4 inches .. then do the back the same amount
I’ve been thinking about the butterfly hair cut for 4 months still scared but I’ll make a video when I do it, my hair is curly to my butt..
What if I want to do this cut and I have curly hair? Normally I would wash and flat iron my hair to get it straight for the cut, but if my hair is wet it’s going to be super curly so I’d never get a straight cut 😢
Please give before & after pics 😭
Get em, B!!! Also, don't forget... you look beautiful today too!!
I love you so much! 😊
How do you know if your hair is has pores? Like i tried water float technique BUT there’s surface tension of water hair didn’t sink when i pushed them they sank because i pushed them down. WTF? Somebody give me a descent way to know pleaseee :)))
Hey Brad! If you don't style your hair, and you got a butterfly cut, will it look stupid?
I am obsessed with your hoody @BradMondo -and I have never used 'obsessed' like that
I cut my hair following your tutorial maybe 2 months ago and my hair looks amazing. I hadn't cut my hair in 6 years because I loathe paying for a haircut that I am never satisfied with, which is 95% the case. Now I should have stopped cutting when you told me to in the video because I got scissor happy and ended up taking 10-12 inches off, but it still looks beautiful. ❤ ❤ Thank you thank you for your awesome tutorials.
I Have a question.... can I use this technique if I have bangs? Cuz I have straight across wispy bangs and my hair is really fluffy and  almost shoulder length.
Everyone in this video had such thin hair …. Kinda anticlimactic not gonna lie brad 😢
I love Brad’s tutorials and I would love to give myself a butterfly cut, but I already have bangs (I cut them in December so of course they have already grown out a little bit) and I am scared I would not get the same result, I don’t know what to do in order to get the proper amount of hair cut without ruining my bangs ‘cause I don’t want them to get shorter or anything, I just want the layers 😫
Brad will you do a tutorial or advice video on cutting hair that is two very different curl types? Like 3b underneath and in back but 2a in the front? And lowish density? Some of us out here don't have thick hair nor perfectly consistent patterning.
Omg i love you reacted to jenna! I watch her videos all the time shes the absolute most adorable @jennaphipps
I know the difference between a good haircut and a bad one for the first time and that's what those hairdressers are really afraid of. If you are angry, it's because you know you are one of the bad hairdressers who are worse or only slightly better than doing it at home. If I had money I'd go to a good one but I'm never paying for a bad haircut again
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH💖💖💖
It is not as easy with thick hair. These girls have very very thin hair.  I would love a thick hair  tutorial
Thank you @BradMondo for giving me the courage to finally shave my hair down to an inch. I got tired of sitting on it every time I moved. This will be easier to deal with since I am physically disabled. Love you Brad ❤️
9:09 The hair looks great in this shot... BUT THE FACE 🤣
Try coconut milk!
I haven't been to a salon in years and this channel has helped me so much to do my own hair and slay. People always ask me who does my hair and i tell them Brad Mondo on YT! lol
Hi BrD tells me what you think about using monistat for hair growth 😮
“It’s about 6 inches and 2 hairs” 😂😂
I gave myself a butterfly cut and I totally failed💀💀💀. But it’s grown out a bit and I actually like how it looks now.
😍😍😍
Sometimes hairdressers dont do a good job as well and when you tell them about it they get super defensive. So videos like yours help others.
I've allways been in love with your butterfly haircut, but my hairs too short and or thin to get one :(
I appreciate the butterfly hoodie Brad😍
Can this be done on Wigs? And or very long hair like 28inch asking to try on my wig I want to add layers
I’ve tried your method a couple of times but for some reason I ALWAYS get a V cut at the back😭I always follow every step & really take my time but i always end up having to trim it to make it a U from the back
JENNA PHILIPS🤡
The butterfly cut literally makes me want to be a hairstylist except I don't want to do anything but butterfly cuts following your tutorial. 😆😆😆😂 It literally looks so good on anyone with straighter hair. It's virtually a fool-proof way of cutting your own hair and actually making it look good. People just need to follow directions and think about the logic behind what they are doing! Because it's genius when you think about why you're cutting the hair the way you are, and once you figure that out if you want to change it up a bit to suit your style more (more than 2 ponytails, different lengths in front vs back, etc) you can. But also you totally don't need to if you can't figure out what's going on. 🤣
❤❤❤
Coconut milk, almond milk, rice milk, all fab
the warm skin tone - glowing - :DD As always, thanks for the hair cutting tips.
I love seeing your vidz. I don't do much with my hair only because I am to lazy but I do dye it black and I was curious on if you where planning on doing a black hair dye for your brand. I would love to try your hair color but I prefer keeping it black just cuz it's the easiest to keep up on lol.❤❤
I did this yesterday along with cutting off 8 inches, I wll say, I definitely did not cut off enough to get any laying, but I didn't want to risk screwing it up so I'm happy with it for now.
Hey Brad, can you do a DIY Tutorial video for a layered haircut with a side parting? For hair that is not longer than shoulder length? It would help me a lot
Layers are a MUST, literally helps to keep your hair in curls when it is too long to do so otherwise!
#JennaPhipps @JennaPhipps Guess who saw your makeover video girl! I was literally screaming interally when i saw your face on his video!
I’m about to cut my curly hair 👩‍🦱 I have a wolf cut and I’m bored of it so I will just cut it in a straight line hopefully I don’t regret it
https://youtube.com/shorts/V48xiasUs_Q?feature=share❤
I love your vids Mr Mundo but please don’t do that action again (ref unicorn) also referred to as d**k head 😂😱😘
Is it just me, or has Brad had work done on his nose? Either way, he looks 🔥
I followed your tutorial today and am so pleased with the result! ❤
I wonder if you’re gluten sensitive. Maybe you could try gluten free oat milk!
I feel like the angry hairdressers overlook the fact there's an influencer for every section of life, and just because Brad is the go-to for hair doesn't make what he does WRONG. Of course everyone knows going to see a professional is better than trying to do things yourself, but not everyone has access.
I don't know what it is about hairdressers - why do they get so angry when people cut their own hair?? I am a psychologist and yay for all the people caring for their mental health on their own as well as yay for everyone who wants or needs professional help. Where are the gardeners telling people they should not care for their own garden, the beauty salons telling you to never do a face treatment on your own, the painters who tell you to not paint your own walls. Is there any other professional group who acts as entitled as hairdressers? 😅
Soy milk matcha yUM
I love a coconut milk matcha. I prefer it to oat, actually. but not everyone is cool with a slight coconut flavor.
Ok you convinced me I’m cutting my hair it’s 1am  My hair reaches my butt let’s see how it will look with 7 inches off
I love his videos but I haven’t seen any videos of black women using his hair dye. Are there any? I have used the orange and it came out gorgeous on my very very short natural hair!!!
I gave myself the butterfly cut.. I left my husband a voicemail while he was at work telling him I was going to cut my hair. He LITERALLY FREAKED THE FUCK OUT 😅 in his defense my hair was down to me arse and he loved the long.... in my defense my hair was down to me  arse 😂😂 and I wanted a change. He actually loved it so much thank you BRAD MONDO ❤
❤❤❤❤
Best video yest
I used your tutorials to cut my own hair and it's absolutely amazing! Butterfly in the front wolf in the back. I have thick curly hair, the extent of my styling now is putting in product for definition and hold. I've never had such a flattering hair cut in my entire life! It's what I've always wanted my hair to be ❤
I used the tutorial on short curly hair and I'm loving the results so far. Might take a teeny bit more off the back but yeah the shape is awesome! Ty🫶🏼
i watched this video bored and alone at 10pm and decided to shower and try this cut. i've never ever cut my own hair, but i followed your tutorial and i'm really happy with the result! i'll even go back in next time i wash my hair to cut off a few more inches (it being my first time cutting my hair, i was a bit scared lol) . love your videos man! <3
About your oat milk problems, have you tried potato milk? Dug Barista tastes almost exactly like oat milk
Brad got some sassy sun on his vacation.
Brad is glowy and flowy today!!
I missed you so much!
11:45 6 inches for women vs 6 inches for men
I usually live your videos but today I feel like you are probably high!! Not so cool.
Coconut milk is awesome! Try this instead of oat milk.
Check out underground cosmetics. They have a hair color mixer that's supposed to make your hair glow under a black light.❤❤❤
Ok but does this cut work on thick hair ??? Like thick thick?? 👁👄👁
I’ve been looking and I didn’t see anything re: product testing of cleansing conditioners (WEN, Biolage, etc.) Do u think they are worth using?
You are really handsome, nice and funny🫣 do you want  to date me?
Hi brad,you probably won't see this, i want too try all your stuff but im in Australia ,you don't ship this far ,please help
😂😂😂 Brad, you're a brilliant guy! I've done this cut on myself, mom, and 2 kids! Loved the cut after the 1st try. Thank you!!!!
Hi there, this cut works in curly hair? i want to cut my hair,  but i doesn´t find a cut who works for me :(
For some reason , your videos stopped showing in my recommandations and I'm pissed. But I'm back and won't miss an episode !
Switch to almond milk matcha!
I was looking at your fit and thinking about how the comfy hoodie/alt accessories was made big by Billie Eilish but tbh 8th grader "skater" kids in the 00s really started that look. It's a vibe
I would literally let Brad do anything to my hair! It’s 100% virgin and mid back. It’s been this way for 7 years! I wouldn’t trust anyone else with my hair😂
brad, i think you should educate yourself and your subscribers on the difference between wavy and curly hair. curly hair curls from the root. the woman in this video does not have curly hair
Omg i had an oat milk matcha yesterday as I can’t have lactose lol
Oh no, not this one, not the only hair tutorial on the internet that makes me actually want to cut my own hair for the first time ever.
Brad! You are amazing! You should do mercy that says Mondo Hair University on it :)
Brad we all love you❤❤ screw the haters😘😘
Me and my hairdresser always talk about how awesome it is that you give people tips on how to do it at home
Is it just me or the first girl after her haircut she aged down
Thank you @bradmondo for doing these videos! Not everyone can afford a $100 haircut let alone several hundred in coloring it. I think the reason we love you so much is you help EVERYONE, not just those who can afford to get their hair done. 😊
curly thin hair here, that's how I've been cutting my hair for over 15 years
Aaahh poopy! Now I wanna do it too... I mean I was okay with a trimmy-trim, but damn, that looks good on finer/thinner hair. Also, I love that you posted people with finer hair, cause I feel like, lately, only the thick hair goddesses got attention from internet hairdressers, and for DIY, one needs a reference of what it looks like on people with thin hair. P.S. You and Guy raised the bar so high for me that the hair people in my town and the vicinity, don't do it for me.. been there, done that, got pissed off, and now I love the result I get from your instructions for DIY.
Hey! So I have a really weird type of hair, it’s curly but very frizzy and poofy - my hair has been the same since I was 6 and I want a change, any ideas? ❤
Well what’s the difference between a wolf cut and a butterfly cut????
I did this cut using your tutorial on myself, my sis, and her daughter and they all came out great cuz I actually followed your instructions. Anyone who had a bad turn out wasn’t paying attention lol.
way to wear a butterfly hoodie for a butterfly haircut video. i see what you did there.
Cashew milk? ❤
I think you great, don’t worry about the other hairdressers. You brighten up my day and you’re so funny you’re absolutely awesome. You make me happy.
Okay. That’s it. You convinced me. I’m cutting my hair after work.
Dear Brad Mondo. 😊 Can we see different coloured backgrounds to match your creative personality and lifestyle pleeeeeaaasssse 💜🩵💙💚💛🤍🧡🩷❤️🤎🖤🩶😁 I think it would be fun with pops of colour against your style 😉 🫶 maybe 1 a month for 12months challenge 🥰💯  Would be a nice pick me up for you and your team to get involve with. Since being overwhelmed as in fluencer, it would be a nice change to the typical setup. Think about it. ❤I know you change your desk colours but how cool would it be to do 2 colours....lol  pink desk, purple background. Green desk,yellow background.  Etc etc...
So glad you took some personal time off to travel! Glad to have you back on YouTube!
That's it, I am doing this next month! Wish me luck!
Hey Brad, have you tried flaxmilk? I love it! Probably not as yummy as oatmilk though, I get it
I’m a hairstylist and I get why ppl do this at home, I freaking get it. Don’t be mad at him! He’s trying to help and it’s entertaining for us lol. ❤
WOW girl number two is SO good with her hair 😮 OMG! I do not know how to do that 😂❤
The first one looks so cute! Great tutorial indeed
When you yelled at april 😂
If your allergy to oat milk is gastrointestinal then it’s usually a wider wheat/gluten allergy (I am celiac and can only have specified gluten-free oat milk) x
I live in rural village in India and am a fashion girlie at heart. We literally do not have any good salons here or in the nearby towns. The ones that are available have ruined my curly hair a couple of times. Also most people don't know how to deal with curly hair. I learned to cut my own hair by watching your videos and did a better job than them. I am so so thankful for  these hair and beauty vidoes because learning how to groom myself has upped my confidence so so much. I feel amazing now. So, if there is anyone who is hating for these educational videos, they can go f**k themselves. We small town girlies also wanna slay and sometimes this is the only way we can. Also, thanks brad.. muahhh😘
Why do I also want to give myself a butterfly haircut now? 😅
What are the angry hairdressers going to do if we have another nationwide lockdown?  PS You went all the way to Sally's Beauty Supply but didn't get any hair ties what a surprise isn't that unwise
👏🏻 👏🏻 the vision 👏🏻👏🏻 the vision is coming to life 👏🏻👏🏻
During Covid, you taught us how to cut men’s & women’s hair. You provided us a service when it was needed the most. Sorry the other #stylists didn’t think of it. 😂
I followed your tutorial, had to do it twice because I find that it was very choppy had to thin out a lot of my hair
"It's a good 6 inches and about 2 hairs." ahahahah!! aaaaah I missed those snappy comments!!! ✨
I tried this! But I have alot of hair and I gathered too much so it’s not my fave cut.
loll my last name is also Phipps pronounced *fipps* not phiLLips and i just felt my school days so hard of people calling me phillips instead of phipps lol also i love these videos
Not Philips but it's ok Brad still love you lol
Hairdressers should understand not everyone can afford to go to a salon. People literally complain no matter what.
Sees Jenna Phillips Brad: now a video by Henna Phillips😂 As another Phipps, we're used to it😅
Do you have temporary dye?
Honestly, I don’t think that you’re doing anything against hairdressers. I think that you’re giving those of us that might not be able to afford to get regular haircuts the knowledge to do it ourselves. You’re helping people that need it so screw what those bitchy hairdressers are saying to you. Most people understand what you’re doing and appreciate it!
This was very fun!
You know the funny thing about brad is he  basically makes money by using other peoples videos\success shore he brings more life to the videos and I'm not knocking him for what he dose just kinda interesting p.s. I do really like his vids and was super bored when he took time off
You: *making hair dressers angry* Me: "Hm, wonder why?"  *does mine, my families, and my friends hair for free after watching SO MANY tips and tutorials*
I did this cut on myself and I feel like I nailed it. It looks amazing with my natural wave/curl. If you follow your instructions your videos are actually fool proof.
ima do one now i’ve been wanting to chop some hair off
Oh my gosh!  I watch Jenna!!!  She is so much fun!
My mom helped me follow your tutorial for the butterfly cut back in February, and I have been loving it! Planning on staying with this style for awhile. 🤣
I know I stopped going to hair dressers back when the pandemic started. I now let my sister do it and she’s amazing due to your videos and others she’s watched. So I say thank you for your awesome advice and videos Brad!! Never let others dim your awesome light! You make a true difference in this world by what you do! 🙂
I mean, I wish I could go to a hairstylist, but it’s just out of my budget unfortunately. I wish the prices were a bit more affordable but I also understand the prices they charge because that is their living, which is why I very much appreciate these type of videos that show how to do it! Happy their hair cuts turned out amazing 🤗
Glad to see you are back, I missed watching your videos. I really love you curly hair line, it makes my hair feel so silky and my curls has beautiful definition. I am looking forward to seeing your next videos and what you do next🥰🥰🥰. Many Blessings to you🙏🏽
F em! ;)
4:36 is my time and for raping u could of said “isn’t that nice”
Brad, NEVER apologize for helping out people that can't afford salons.  There will always be lazy and/or rich ppl (or those that can't cut their own hair for various other reasons) that'll still keep salons open.  For the rest of us, especially in this crap economy, we really appreciate tutorial videos like yours (and good lord, it's not like you are the ONE and ONLY person on social media doing that 🙄).  I'm so glad you give zero effs and aren't apologizing to the bratty people complaining.  All throughout my 40 yr life, I only had TWO people do my hair that actually knew how to work with my hair type, which is both extremely fine in strand and extremely thin in amount (yay me).  Going to salons were quite traumatizing for me otherwise since they treated my hair the way they would a regular person and that meant they ALWAYS cut too much off or cut the layers too thick.  Then when my hair pretty much all but fell out completely and I started wearing wigs, I just started trimming what was left of my natural hair at home since I don't really care what it looks like anymore.  Still, I do way better than 99% of stylists ever did.  Then about 5 yrs ago, my mom, who used to go to salons all the time (her hair is normal), asked me to cut her hair since she noticed me cutting mine.  I told her I have no clue what I was doing but she insisted.  After looking up some tutorials (of which weren't even yours at the time), I attempted my first haircut on someone else.  It wasn't terrible, but not great.  Then after finding videos (again, not yours) of these ponytail tricks, I've now refined being able to cut layers on her and it now comes out the same or even better than what she would get at most salons!  It's actually quite irritating how easy it is to cut beautiful layers using the ponytail methods only because I wish I would have known sooner! 😄😄  I'm sure hair dressers are just upset people learned a very easy trick that could save them hundreds, if not thousands of dollars.  You weren't the first to show us and won't be the last.  I think you're just being caught in the middle of their crossfire towards the general tutorial community because of your popularity, but it's definitely not your fault and you're helping BOTH stylists and people that can't afford them.  So here's a long-winded thank you!! 😅😋😂
Omg I can't believe people are mad at you. I'm immunocompromised and I can't just walk into a salon safely, so I have to do it myself. Brads making my life easier.
So happy to see you back, Brad! You’re just such an amazing teacher! Very creative and such a joy to watch. 🌷
If anything you're giving them more work bc they have to fix ppl's hair after they do it at home 😌
Dear Brad, please do a tutorial for a shaggy, curly bob with chunky bangs. I love you. Thank you very much. -Susan
Just here looking for Jon Scott groupies....😂
Hairdressers don't like you because you're famous for YouTube not for being a  Hairdresser
Can you try an almond milk Brad??
Gee Brad, your language. 😡
omg lowkey all three cuts came out amazing!! all thanks to ur tutorial :)
Instead of oat milk you can use rice milk, it’s naturally sweet and creamy. Highly recommend!! I don’t drink my matcha any other way now 😋
Hey Brad! Can you do a review on miss Maniquin, with Glaze hair product?? Thanks!!!
Could you do a tutorial for thick hair?
You don’t want any hair splints in your hands lol
I will stan for you, Brad - you're a goddamn HERO for your at-home haircut tutorials! I've been using your wolf cut on my own hair for at least a year and a half, when lockdown hit; loved it so much, I was happy to say "buh-bye!" to haircuts at a salon (struggled to afford them, and always felt intimidated by the hip young girl hairdressers in there anyway, who looked at middle-aged, tomboyish me like something the cat had dragged in!) I have long wavy, wolverine hair that, like Miley Cyrus, cannot be tamed, so the wolf cut works fairly well on that. I'm keen to try this butterfly cut now, as it looks slightly easier - but I gues2 I might have to wait for the wolf cut to grow out first - or maybe my wild mane isn't suitable for a Butterfly cut at all? Anyway, please keep doing what you do - we'll fight off any angry hairdressers for you!
Hairdresser always advice you to cut your hair but long hair is more beautiful than short
Is brad okay? 😅
“APRIL, DONT EVER DO THAT AGAIN” 😂😂
I regularly use your method to trim ends. Very satisfied. 4 years ago was the last time a saw a hairdresser.
layers look good until they grow out and you have thin and/or wavy hair 😭
People are going to cut their own hair regardless- so like it’s good to give them skills to do it.
I just had to tell you THANK YOU!!!!!! I am on a very limited budget so it would be like choosing between a good quality haircut and groceries. I have very thick hair and needed layers so bad and after watching your butterfly cut video for two days I went for it. I LOVE IT. Now I can always have the layers I need. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU ❤
He should react to crochet hair!! Brad I love everything you do!!!
I always colored and treat my hair at home because of social anxiety and not trusting most os professionals.  They almost never listen to the things I say about the individualities of my hair. So I stop making it blond (the colored I like the most in me). After watching you I felt safe about using bleach and toning. I feel very happy about it now.  So tanks!!!  Professionals that feel threatened should consider that people always did hair at home, I do my mothers white roots since I was 10 years old 😅  If you are good and people like being your client, thats not going to being a problem.
ok does the cut still work if i already have some layers and ALSO if i already have a little bit of a fringe (it's grown out now )
Glad your back!❤ Did hair, nails... etc. and had been since age 10...on my friends and myself. 😂  In my mom's salon...  she set up a room for me with everything I needed... including the rocket ship dryer from the late 60's...  this wasp in late 70's early 80's... Then I got my license... Don't cut professionally anymore, but keep my license...  Love your channel!  If stylists are truly good stylists they'll be busy...  Don't hate on Brad. Stack your books yall!❤🎉
My hair is averagly thick, I had a wolf cut before and I loved it, it gave my hair more volume. It made my hair look healthy. A was the moment for me. Now my hairs grow now and it looks flat I really desperately want my hair in a layered haircut, my mama won't agree with me, everyone keeps saying I need to grow my hair, I honestly look better with medium–shoulder length hair. And every time I want you videos, my desire to cut hair by myself rises. I've never cut I hair by myself before, kind of terrified of what the results might look like-it's almost a year since I've been trying to convince my mother but nothing works 😭😭
I also have curly hair and I did the butterfly cut back in October. It came out great it definitely gave my hair more volume and brought my curls to life!😁
Thanks to you, I am able to successfully cut my own hair and I've become my mom's personal stylist. I've watched almost all of your videos, so my skills have greatly improved! To get an appointment here, you have to book online. They make you send current pictures of your hair and inspiration pictures of what you're going for, then sometimes they require you to get a consultation. xD And the haircut, even for just a simple trim costs anywhere from $50-$80.. just for the cut, this does not include shampooing or styling. I only ever just get a few inches trimmed and do some layering, I don't need all that hassle. Things have really changed since Covid, nowhere near me accepts walk-ins anymore. So, I'm very thankful for all of your videos and tutorials. Truly.
I did the butterfly cut and LOVED IT!! Thank you for doing this.  I just got your XMONDO gem purple color.  Done, I get soooo many compliments. My husband loves it.
😂😂😂 that intro
My hairdresser loves you! ♡
Why are you starting your video as if you are sexually orgasming? Disgusting
Brad, try the Moola banana milk. I can't do lactose, nuts, soy, or oat. Banana milk is where it's at. Love you <3
I think I'm going to do this tonight when I get home from work because I have some dead af ends that need to go
It’s good to see you back on YouTube @Brad Mondo doing hair reactions again like old times
That’s it gonna do it
Does this work with thicker hair as well? I have very thick wavy hair 😅😅😅
Love this video but what I love more is that sweater. Where did you get it beautiful x
Fag
This would have been  good video if the guy would stop talking so much .
I don’t understand why YouTube recommended this rubbish
Bro this is so random and some people may not agree with me but the first girl in specific like parts looks like hunter chafer. Like what the hell
Hairdressers being mad at you and not for a minute wonder why people would rather cut their hair themselves instead of paying 50 dollars on short bob length hair just to get a trim on the ends (just went through all my neighborhood salons in my country and they said compulsory shampoo + blowout even though I just want them to wet my hair, cut it in about 5 minutes and let me leave like this, I ain't paying 50 dollars and sitting in the salon for 2 hours just for this on this length of hair babe)
Off topic, where can I buy this sweatshirt??😂😅🫶🏻
I was allergic to oats for a decade - I stopped eating/drinking them for ages and eventually it got better. I don't know why though. Sorry to hear you're struggling. I know how it feels!
I love Jenna and I love Brad and I watch both of you guys… when 2 worlds collide 😮love this!!! ❤❤❤
Sorry that you have to deal with angry hairdressers.. I want to thank you cause I followed your tutorial how to cut your hair at home. I had been going through a depressive episode and struggled financial and now my hair looks fine again and I didnt have to spend much money❤
I usually cut my own hair but I also tried the butterfly cut on myself ... I didn't record it, and I have really long hair and I didn't want to cut too much off , so I'm sure if I did do a video it wouldn't have been too exciting but my hair does feel better and maybe I'll do it again and cut more later.
Idk what is wrong with people why they hate Brad mondo like without any reason.😒 Brad you are my one of the favourite person on youtube i love watching your videos and the starting specially "hello beautiful ! you look absolutely stunning today"😩😅. These days people don't share their secrets where brad is just like an open, skilled, free of any cost information centre isn't it enough ? 🙄 So yes you're the best brad and i will watch your videos every single time 💖
You tell em boo, f@$% them haters. Plenty of people still spend way too much money at salons so yall scissor Nazis stfu! Hi Brad 😁😁😁🎉
I did a combo of the front part of the butterfly cut and the side sweep bangs tutorial and it looks so good! I haven't been to a hair dresser since December 2019 lol.
Try coconut milk and honey for a sweetener
That last one is Nicol Concilio, she's a makeup YouTuber/influencer! I watch her makeup videos, she's awesome! I haven't watched her portion of the video yet I posted to make this comment but I hope it comes out well! Love you Nicol❤
Not sure why YT recommended this channel to me. I don't care about the content, just wanted to comment on the fact that thus dude looks like he could be the little brother of singer, Howie Day.   That is all.
I've cut my own hair since I was 11. I love your tutorials. Thanks! BTW my butterfly came out awesome!
I cut my hair following your tutorial and I am obsessed!!!! So far all my friends love it and they've only seen pictures... I didn't tell my parents about it but I think they'll like it (if they notice)
Am I crazy but does that first girl look like Stevie from GMM
You need to do hair color/cut coaching with people on video! Where they do their hair with your help (on zoom or something?)
Love your video Brad! My daughter definitely needs a better hairdresser.
I honestly don’t have time to go to a salon, thank you for your videos 🧡
Nicole rocked it. Omg. ❤️
Try almond milk or soy milk! 7:00
Matcha is also very good with almond milk.  That's how I drink mine.  Or if you have access to raw milk.  It's amazing with that.
I'm surprised you got on to the hair cut dressers. About time you tell them off. I've been sick and tired of assholes. Love you Brad !
I want to do this SO badly but I have thick, THICK, curly hair. All these I see have thin hair. 😢
The hoodie ?? Really cute
the intro is 11/10
How’d this low rent shit get on my feed. Losers
brad so much love a month ago i also followed ur video for this and was soooooooo happy. probably cutting my own hair from now on. 💜
Can you do a video on how to trim a bob?
i absolutely love your channel and jennas and this video was like an awesome cross over episode
Did someone tell you to make annoying sounds, voices and do nonsense like clapping? Don't.
Brad is sassy today and I am here for it. *edit to add - please share skincare routine Brad! You are GLOWING
I’ve cut my hair like this since becoming disabled, successfully. I couldn’t afford my salon anymore and had a bad experience after having my hair cut in an attack, so I didn’t trust a cheap haircut. I figured, if I was going to have my hair messed up, I would do it myself.  It was great, then I let it grow to my butt during covid, as I was with my elderly parents. I was ill recently and decided to cut it to above my shoulders, so i went to a cheap place…and yeah, it was bad. I had to fix it when I got home, but she did take off small ponied sections, so I would have my hair for making custom hairpieces.
Does this work for a horse
The second girls sectioning is perfect she’s good at doing parts
I used to wear my hair like this when my 18 year old was little lol so like 15 years ago this was my hair style very nice
watched this as a background while refreshing my layers and curtain bangs :DD it went really well!!
I need to do this, I need a haircut so badly😂
Some people can't even afford food let alone a $60+ haircut. I'm am always super grateful for stylists who put this info out there for us poor folks
Thank you much!!! I love cut my hair and that is the best tutorial for the best haircut ever. YOU are the BEST! ❤
Wow! This DYI for haircuts is awesome! I have hair past my buttocks and I’ve been considering a trim up. This tip is very helpful. I’m 66 with healthy shiny hair. I plan to try this later this summer.
So for the milk situation, you could try soy milk, rice milk, coconut milk or almond milk🤗
Some of us can't afford salon prices, so thx Brad! ❤😊
The conditioner is actually a game changer! I have always struggled to cut my own hair because I CANNOT brush it while it’s wet, but now I can! So simple and easy
I shaved my head one year ago and now I'm obsessed with the butterfly cut. I saved the tutorial, and I'm just waiting for my hair to grow enough ✨✨
The first creature resembles Hunter Schafer
Not to diss beauticians by any means  but  OMG I faithfully used  Brad's tutorial on the butterfly cut today and it turned out absolutely gorgeous, I would have posted a video but I'm gonna be 67 this year so I figured I'm way outta the demographic range 😂 but thanks Brad Mondo!!!❤
I’ve never walked out of a salon feeling like my cut was worth the money paid. I’ve always experimented with hair DIY though and since lockdown do my own cuts. I don’t care if it isn’t perfect if I do it myself. Tried this cut last weekend and it came out great!
Brad, one time, ONCE, I cut my own bangs.  That was when I was 14, and EVERY SINGLE THING since then, I have ALWAYS had a hairdresser do my hair, cut, color, etc.  I’m absolutely terrified almost 40 years later, very traumatic experience.  So, I love my hairdressers over the years! 🎉❤🎉
You do a fantastic job. Ignorant people can’t follow simple instructions.
Hi Brad, I really need some advice. I naturally have black hair and I colored my hair blue like 5 months ago and they messed up the color midnight blue and gave me a lighter blue. I went back and they fixed it however not even a month later my hair started looking damaged and the color was running out. I love my long hair and looking at it so damaged really pissed me off. So i got a midnight blue box die but then it started looking more black than blue🙄 now my hair looks brown and blond cos everything is washing out and my hair is going to its stripped color. I don't know what to do to save it and don't know if i should just cut it just above my shoulders since i wanted an obre effect from my black hair to midnight blue and my top hair isn't damaged as i didn't bleach my roots.
Period brad tell them to eff off lmao ! We love you thank you for all the knowledge you’ve given many of us !❤️
Flax,Coconut,Almond, cashew or hemp milk are all good alternatives to Oat Milk
Fr I was so sad when one of my fav tiktok hairstylists started hating on Brad 😭  Like, no where in brads videos does he say to never go to a salon and only do your own hair. He just recognizes that people want to do their own hair at home and was like “here are some tips and tricks to help you” ❤
@BradMondo in regards to oatmeal allergy (not sure what you are allergic to), try making power grain granola (gluten free) with heated almond milk. Nature's Harvest Pumpkin Seed and flax seed granola is amazing
I did the butterfly cut on myself and it looked soo good, a friend of mine even asked for the salon , i get my hair done at
Do matcha lemonades! So good
I asked my sister the other day if she wanted her hair trimmed, and she said yes. They day comes where I'm trimming up her hair, but I cut it in a butterfly cut since it's just a little bit easier. She asks me, "Do you know what you're doing?" In full confidence I said, "I won't do anything without consulting Brad Mondo." (more specifically your tutorial videos)
Can you do this cut if you generally part to the side?
"The layers are the moment" put that on a shirt
Aside from the angry hairdressers, I am grateful for you teaching us things because I don’t like people messing with my hair except my one hairdresser and I don’t get to see him often if at all since he’s always busy.   Also - I’m so glad your beautiful face is back in my subs 🥰
i love u Brad❤ ty for sharing ur precious info with us 🎉💐👯
I have a co-worker who keeps giving herself wolf cuts. She's trying to cut off the dyed parts of her hair. It's starting to look like a mullet.
I'm in school right now and have no disposable income so the hair tutorials are greatly appreciated. I don't understand how people think this could take business from a salon. If someone can't afford your service knowing how to do it on their own still doesn't make them able to afford your service. It only helps. Side note: try matcha with coconut milk. It still tastes really good. I like adding a pump of french vanilla and cold foam on mine. The vanilla gives it that "milk" taste instead of the coconut taste overpowering the drink it evens out a bit more.
I am thankful for you, Brad, for not only helping me cut my own hair, but to be comfortable enough to dye my own hair.  My hairdresser moved away, so, I just learned to do it myself.  Thanks Brad Mondo!
Dear community, I have a question and maybe you can help me. In this video they talk about using a random object to measure how much to cut off. This feels uncertain for me, especially when you do this for months and let's say the back always gets cut a liiiiittle less then the front. It will look wrong over time. So my question is: How do you figure out how much hair to cut off of the second pony tail when you cut the first already so that  front and back fit?
6:47 only me or Is his shirt ACTUALLY glowing..?
you should check out txunamy's butterfly cut i dont know if she used ur tutorial but yeah in my opinion she did a good job
that intro was so sensual 😵🫣❤
Props to Brad for calling out shitty, petty hair dressers who get mad about this shit—cause REALLY good hairstylists don’t have to worry about this because they actually have the skills to keep them making money.   But a LOT be charging way to much for things you can learn to do yourself—and that is why they get mad….because they aren’t that good. I went to someone who was going to charge me like $200+ to do my hair and completely fried it……like… just cause the time for bleaching or coloring is whatever—doesn’t mean you can charge someone for that time if you don’t have that skill. ANNNNND…even if you are good—why are you shitting on people who can’t afford you? Just because I can’t afford Guy Tang, doesn’t mean I shouldn’t be able to have hair I like… it’s such gatekeeping mentality. Like not everyone can spend $1000 or more a year on their hair….I haven’t even gotten mine done since 2021…. Why hate on someone allowing me to feel more confident within my current budget? Sorry, rant over but I HATE those gatekeeping hair stylists.
After days on contemplating for a few months, idid the butterfly cut on myself. Have to say I love it. Gives so much more life to my otherwise boring hair. I'm sure it could've been better but I did my best!
I’m a hairdresser and I approve of cutting your hair at home!!! Lol it’s is fun and not everyone has the time to get it done or the money!! ❤ love you Brad!
Omg I missed you!!😅
I love you Brad, you're so uplifting and cute. I had a hair stylist do my hair and she talked trash about you while doing it. I tried to not say anything too mean to her since she was doing an all over bleach on me.. Well she ended up frying my hair and ruing my beautiful long red locks. So not only does she not know how to do hair, she talked crap about my favorite hairstylist. 🙄 some people just suck
Do cashew milk it’s so much better than almond milk and oat milk because they both are extremely processed.
I have fine, curly/wavy hair... every time someone layers my hair it looks god awful...so I never get it layered. I feel this would look cute, but not sure. Wish we could show pics on here lol Brad, what do you think?
I’m in the UK and hairdressers are not as expensive. They are not cheap either. When I discovered the price of hairdressers in USA I was amazed. No wonder people have to dye their own hair. I feel those hairdressers seem bitter that you are educating people.
Me too, I just ate right before I watched this lol and it was the best damn ramen I've ever had!!!
I wish you had samples for your hair products. I have tried just about everything and I have found nothing is working on this dry frizzy curly hair.
I'm going to try this😍
OMG JENNA PHIPS IS THERE
omg i’m watching this and my boyfriend, who is allergic to oat milk, is next to me and hates that i still get to drink it, says to Switch to almond milk! it’s no oat milk, but it has its own amazing flavor ❤ also i feel so bad for you both 😩
Honestly, this would've saved my butt when I was in uni and perpetually broke. I worked at a bar back then, so taking care of your appearance definitely helped the amount I received in tips, but I literally had weeks where I'd have to decide between going to the hairdresser and eating well bc those extra 50€ were a lottttt of money for me back then.  Like, now that I have a regular job and income, I'd always go to a professional - but there are literally people who don't have money to go to the hairdressers regularly, and I think tutorials like yours can really help them feel better and less stressed about their appearance and finances.
Brad at the end of the video 😮🐬
I gave myself a butterfly and I LOVE IT! Thank you <3
I saw this tutorial back when you posted it and sat on it for 2 weeks before I went ahead and did it randomly one night. Its grown out a bit now and I still loving the cut. I'm probably gonna trim it here soon because it's getting a little too long for my tastes.   My hair is thinner in the front, thicker in the back, and very fine, so it helped to give it some good body and volume in the front. It was all basically one length before I cut it. I may be doing my mom's and my daughter's hair this way soon.
I ruined my hair trying this cut 😅 I had to chop it off to match both the top to the bottom. It was a manic moment 🤷🏻‍♀️ Love you Brad 🖤
If you have an extreme gluten intolerance, it might be trace amounts in the oats that are causing you issues? Cashew milk I hear is good :)
I really hope you go watch Jenna PHIPPS’s much more recent “at home glow up” where she box dyed her hair. It came out petty. I love her for her DIYs and knit/crochet projects! 😙🤌*chef kiss*
Macadamia nut milk Brad! I swear by this!
omg jenna
Every where I look I see mid-part styles and cuts.. Brad PLLLEEAASSE could we get love for the side part beauties??? please and thank you :)
Mind blown 🤯 by how good it turned out for the girls in video! I might just have to try it 😮
Brad, I had to give up oat milk, too (damn, it’s so tasty and creamy). I felt so bloated and like I was retaining fluid. I just went back to soy milk, no sugar obvs.. but, tastes awful…
I used your tutorial the other day and love it !!  Also did a fire ombre and it turned out amazing.  I took like 6 inches off and it's so freeing.
Nooo, I don't want you getting hate!! You are my go to for hair help! Sadly I messed my butterfly cut, but it was because I was so scared when it came to cutting the under layers and they turned out too long.... Oops! But I have social anxiety, so it's not like I go out anyways 😂
Side note : has anyone every noticed how FLAWLESS Brad’s skin is ??? BRAD please do a skin care video !
Brad! Can you rate “No poo” hair wash routines? I went two years without shampooing my hair. I only started shampooing again because my hard water made my hair tangly and dry. But shampoo gives me an allergic reaction on my scalp. I haven’t found one that doesn’t. I need a real hair dresser’s opinion on no poo methods!
I love, love, love watching people cut their own hair! Time for me to do mine! Got the back done, looks good. The front is scary. If I mess up, no worries; it will grow back!
They all slayed it!  Part of me being a woman is to be capable of doing as many things as possible.  I mean being knowledgeable. I go to the hair dresser as well as cutting my own hair. Ever since Covid, it seems like any hairdresser I go to has lost their passion. So I’ve taken a break from them and trim my own hair. Sometimes people don’t know exactly what they want until they cut their own hair. Thank you for these videos. They are so fun.
It just makes me glow with pink light and GaYnESs - brad 2023
"Its a good SiX InCheS and about TwO hAirS" LmAOOOOO
honestly you have helped me get through the hair part of school especially hair coloring and hair cutting
Curious to know if this method works on thick, full hair? 😅
Brad, I genuinely Love You! Hope to meet u some day! T-T
I can't always afford the luxury of a hairdresser, but thanks to your videos, I'm able to color and cut my hair at home at a price point I can afford. I think people forget how much of a luxury it is to be able to go to a professional. Your videos go such much further than just providing entertainment.
I sent your videos to my siblings a few months back and boy did their hair come out good! Better than a hair salon, which is usually crooked. 😊
Brad, what happened to a bunch of your America's Next Top Model videos?
I need you to do a tutorial for like a super short wolf cut/shag mullet type cut, cause I want to cut off ALL of my hair. Love you!!!
I did this cut for the first time a few days ago and I’m SHOOK. I’m a college student and literally have no money to get my hair cut so this has been such a game changer for me. 💕
Well fuck. Guess I'm gonna go and cut my own hair now... 😬
Cut my own hair after watching your "Face framing layers" video and it turned out amazing! Thank you Brad. Have to try this one next time 🥰
Great video 👍  3 for 3 ❤🦋🦋
Make a reaction video on Olena beley ( Hair care secrets every girl should know )
Use Rice milk for the matcha latte, it makes it sooo creamy, better than oat milk even
I know brad has good energy cuz my 8 month old gets so happy when I put him on the TV.
i go to the hairdresser get my haircut colour and get my haircut
i tried to give myself layers before this cut was trendy and it turned out very short on top but now ive got exactly this cut without trying and i love it
can you teach us how to use thinning scissors? i have layered haircut and i wonder if i can use thinning scissors, too. i have really thick hair
so many people can’t go to hairdressers because of money, anxiety, mental health, travelling etc… many many reasons. you’re not discouraging people from going hairdressers. idk why the other hairdressers are angry/upset with you bc you’re doing something really good!
the first girl kinda looks like hunter schafer
I literally do this every few months.
I'm an ex hair dress and I'm now disabled. Most salons (in my area) simply cannot cater to disabilities and have zero understanding of how the amount of stimuli in a salon affects people. I just can't go anymore. I have tried a few times, but the prices now too - it's too much. I am all for people doing their own hair if they research it. What I don't want, is people having unrealistic expectations of what they do themselves OR what hairdressers can do for them and your channel addresses both of these things. There is enough to go around :)
Love you Brad, Pls come to Australia 🇦🇺  Im dying to try your colours
So cool to see Jenna in this! (The first girl) She has amazing content on fashion, crochet, sewing.. its a whole vibe
Wow, so familiar… but they are prettier with that hair style
I'm a hairdresser and I could literally care less that brads out here helping people... because THAT WOULDNT MAKE SENSE 😂😂
I have diagnosed panic disorder and going out to the salon can cause me an unreasonable amount of stress (makes no sense I know), but your content is super useful for me when I need to update my hair but I'm having a particularly bad month with anxiety. I tend to give myself a break and will hardly go out (other than work) for a few weeks so I don't overload, and doing it myself that month means I don't have to go out looking like the yeti monster!
You can use almond milk instead of oatmilk it tastes different but maybe give it a try :)
Can someone tell me if this hair cut looks good on a side part? My hair is naturally side-parted, and I wanna know if I might regret this hair cut!!
Mad hairdressers? The nerve. Those that have the money to go to a salon, will still go. Aside from people who may try it for the trend. There are many many people who don't have the money to even contemplate going? Me being one of them. Also because of my long and thick hair, I am almost obligated to cut it short to make it even a maybe almost affordable once a year. Stay mad.
Brad!!! Oat milk is gluten. I can’t have oat milk for that reason. Almond milk is just the best in my opinion for the diverse use. Other than that you can do soy 🤷🏻‍♀️ because the other milks just aren’t creamy.
Is the butterfly cut ok to do on thin hair?
Jenna!!!  Love her.
April's utility room is Sooo tidy !! Well done girl...
Lol I still trim my own hair from your videos ❤ also gave me confidence to do more love you
My hair is so hard to work with when wet, that whenever I cut my own hair I always did it dry. Otherwise it's tangle city.
Jenna looks a bit like Jules (from euphoria)
Elles sont Toutes, après la coupe... Magnifiques !!!!!
Lol when I died my hair blonde my  neighbour copied me and ended up dying her hair white 🤣🤣🤣
Question:  My hair is rather fine (and according to my hairstylist is more thick than I believe it to be), but it's also incredibly straight- obnoxiously straight, even. My hair does not seem to hold curl when professionals have styled it, as well as when I've *wanted* it to hold some curl, waves, or SOMETHING other than being stick straight.  Of course, my hair will "betray" me by getting a weird kink in it that won't go away after tucking it behind my ear for a short moment, though!😡😤  In any case, would the "Butterfly Cut" work for my hair type? I'm very low-maintenance, so I've essentially always stuck to long, face-framing layers. I feel like it pretty much looks like the cuts I've just seen, but could it perhaps give me the volume I need (It's very flat), or would it essentially be the same?  I believe my hairsylist also uses a razor comb or something to that effect on parts of my hair to possibly add texture? (Sorry, I'm not saavy with the tools, cuts, etc)  Bonus question: Does this cut also work well with side parts, or is it made strictly for center parts?  Thanks in advance to any who took the time to read and answer ❣️
Please please please where is this hoodie from??!! Xxxx
Brad your personality is literally why we love you.. well at least for me, you can make videos about ANYTHING and I will always watch you cuz you make me laugh so much! KEEP BEING YOU!
Hi Ben I know there’s a chance that you won’t see this but I’m really struggling with hair fall out and it’s starting to thin its been like that since I had my baby girl can you recommend anything that’s not going to cost a lot and works there’s so much out there I’m not sure what really works or is just a wast of money
Honestly I don’t understand why people are mad, there will always be people that want to get their hair done from a hairdresser and people that want to do it themselves. I personally prefer to go to hairdresser. There’s no need for people to be mad about you helping people cut their own hair I tho k it’s a very nice things
Where have you been!!!!!
Girl vanilla coconut milk, so much better than oat milk and is great in breakfast beverages ❤
Just went to my hairdresser last week got my hair bleached, with a root shadow and a long over due cut. But because I had so much regrowth it was VERY expensive. I'm not sorry but I do understand why people can't do it. Very thankful that I can! ♥️
Allergic to oatmilk? Why not try... milk!
Why is cutting your own hair risky?! Hair grows! No regrets! Do it! Feel it! Love it! Live your dam freaking life! <3
Yes Brad! Up the hairdressers giving you shizz. We appreciate you thinking of those of us struggling out here
Thanks Brad. Cut my hair this morning (butterfly cut) and it was a success, you saved me $150 bucks, cheers 🇦🇺
Use almond milk. So good 🎉
Not me watching this at 2am contemplating if I should do this right now...
I followed the tutorial and man i feel like an xpert now🤣🤣🤣🤣i love my hair cut
Instead of oat milk try nutpods!
Your butterfly cut saved me during the big c!!!  I just my first prof cut last weekend just because I wanted a bob and that was not going to work!!
Brad, I love you for showing us this cut. I have been going through some really hard times this past year with money after suffering an illness that took me out of work. I haven't been to a salon in over a year now but with the butterfly cut video that changed everything. This cut has saved my hair and saved me money. Believe me, when things are better in the future I'll be happy to go to the salon again, but for right now I can't thank you enough for showing us this cut!
Hairdressers have internalized at-home-ophobia
Try rice milk instead of oat milk, it’s AMAZING!
Yeah the top half is looking a toddler got ahold of it. Bottom looks basically non touched. I give up lol
If you're allergic to oat milk that's a sign that you are better off using real cream!
i didn’t film it but i done mine a few weeks ago, followed the instructions, love it !!
“To the skies to the heavens to Jesus Christ” 😂😂😂
As a hairdresser the sound at 12:29 hurts my soul after she just pulled her hair apart with her fingers. In terms of all the hate you're getting, I think it's more that hairdressers have a name to put on people that do their hair at home instead of just being upset with the client when they have to fix a self cut. I think that for someone that's going to do it anyways, it's good to have some sort of easy cut and guidance to reference. There's also a lot more people doing their own hair since COVID-19 and the culture of viral videos like your tutorials and other people showing themselves cutting their hair can make people overconfident in doing it themselves. Whenever I see cuts go wrong, there is usually major factors that people don't realize they're doing wrong and you do try to point those out in your tutorials. It's hard when people take the footnotes and expect the fine print to be perfect.
🫶🏾
I followed your tutorial for a cut (wolf cut maybe) and the hairdresser who does my hair now said it looked good. She didn't seem to mind that and you gave solid advice.
Oi Brad, you been on vacay recently? You got some tan going over there!  PS how do you feel about peekaboo highlights? I’ve been considering getting those done again but not sure what colour I should go with this time
April is LITERALLY ME! I dyed my hair blonde 3 times,brown,blue,pink,green,back to blonde then now it’s a brown so I feel u with the breaking ends 😅
As someone who's disabled and chronically ill I have little income so I can't afford a salon and have to do my own hair. I always feel bad, but I literally can't afford it.  I'm very grateful for tutorials online.
They’re just jealous!
Hey! First, I’m glad you are back! Second, what’s the best cut for curly? You mentioned this isn’t the best for curls…I usually do the unicorn cut but not sure if that’s the best one. Please help with your advice!
Im a hairdresser and I love you js, keep doing you boo
Brad, as a long time viewer and hairstylist, yes, you do come out with videos or give information at times that do pull clients away. But As other people have said, getting hair done in a salon is a LUXURY in time and $$. I am always so mad when people give you hate for the vast knowledge you put in the world. you were meant to exist on the internet, if you didn’t start creating content someone else would have. I can tell this is an issue that eats at you, and I just want you to know you have so much love coming your way, ignore the hate, and for however long you decide to make these vids, IM ALWAYA GLAD TO WATCH!
I cant agree lol . I hate layers :-/ last time I got layers I looked like Jennifer Aniston on early friends lol
I’m a hairdresser; myself and all of my coworkers love you. No hate from us💕
2nd girl It looks gorgeous she did
I need a tutorial on cuts to do to make growing out my pixie cut less awkward cause it looks so awkward right now 😅
I wonder what the butterfly cut looks like with an undercut 🤔
Watching this while doing my money pieces blue I can’t wait to try your knew blue color 😍
I did the butterfly cut and love it
Exactly not everyone can even afford to go to salons. I’m a trained hair dresser too and I get it lol no hate from me 💕
FCK THEM HAIRDRESSERS 🙅‍♀️✂️😂  We love you brad!!
I think your videos are fine. Anyone claiming you helped ruin their hair was gonna ruin their hair anyway. A) if you want your hair to come out we’ll GO TO A PROFESSIONAL everyone knows that b) if you’re okay with having to spend money to fix your hair after you fuck it up (or just grow it out) then brad mondo. Or ask a girl in salt beauty lol
I get the controversy around his credentials he claims to have. But these videos help people who can’t go to appointments bc of disability or money or even anxiety. And they help people learn to communicate with their stylist anyway! So many times I see mean posts about “my client asked for copper hair and was mad it was orange” without understanding that your client probably doesn’t understand color theory and their skin tone. Some skin tones can make copper hair look warmer. Your videos help people tell their stylist “I like warm reds but I do not want it on the orange side I’m looking more for a red on the light brown side like a dark henna red.”   I really hate how condescending stylists can be.    Like I get it. Doctors do the same. They hate when people Google without trying to decipher the point the patient makes. Yes you went to school. But if clients are asking for something not realistic or doesn’t understand why hair colors they picked are not the vision they had you should try to decipher what the bare bones of their request is
omg you need to try vanilla almond milk in matcha it’s so good
Less talk from you we watch this to watch the video haircuts not listen to you so hush
Someone on here is one of my favorite YouTubers...... ❤
Hey Brad how are you? Do you deliver your products to Australia? . Kind Regards Shireen
Does anyone have tips on how to grow straight her quicker? My hair usually grows SUPER slowly, so I appreciate any info I can get!!!❤
The thing is, people are going to cut and dye their hair at home ANYWAY, you are just giving them the tools for it to not look terrible.
I would rather have u not talking during these!!!
I’ve only gotten compliments on my hair since following the butterfly cut tutorial and it’s looking so cool as it’s growing out more! Honestly one of my favorite haircuts I’ve given myself, I actually got my hair done for my sister’s wedding the other day and my hairdresser was asking me how I get my blonde and why I’m not a hairdresser with how good I do on my own hair 😭😭 that felt like such an honor and I owe a lot of my cutting technique to things I’ve picked up from your videos too! I’ve been cutting and coloring hair at home for my mom, friends, their moms, and myself for about nine years now, and I’ve been cutting my boyfriend’s hair for the last year now! I wish you’d do more videos on mens cuts so I could have more help there LOL!! Sending love always 💜💜
You weird you don't say I coming offensive
"It's a good 6 inches and about ...two hairs"   Had me dying 😂😂
Me wondering if I can do this cut with my really short hair 😅
WHEN APRIL DID THAT 😳
The oatmilk cut off
you  should die your hair with cool laid and hot water trusst ME
I tried the butterfly haircut with some success. The front part was easy to cut. I had a hard time cutting the back of my hair cause it's shorter!
Omg, Jenna Phipps! 😮❤  Brad you said her name wrong. 😢
For the oatmilk allergy, if it's mild, you can take a Benadryl prior to consuming oatmilk. If it's moderate-severe, it's best to avoid. There's also almond, soy or rice milk.
My hair grows extremely fast. And I cannot afford to constantly get it cut. Especially since Covid (money has been extra tight). Thanks to your tutorials I’ve been able to have a decent hairstyle and cuts between being able to treat myself to a salon day 😅currently two years and counting
It’s the gluten in the pay I’d say
I used to trim my hair before I watched your videos, but after watching your videos I cut my hair in a fit of angst and honestly, it's 10/10 thanks to *YOU*, Brad.
Not that he said “it’s about 6 inches and 2 hairs” 💀😂😂🤣 I missed the Brad humor 😅❤️‍🩹
You’re the BeSt AnD FuCk ThE ReSt!!!
On the flip side,  the hairstylists make money from the fails so they still win😂😂😁🤷🏿‍♀️
BRAD CAN YOU DO A FULL VIDEO TESTING HEAT PROTECTANTS🔥✨🙏🏼
Jenna Philips... I love her❤
WAIT you have silver ring splints on! do you have EDS too?
I needed this video! Yes 👏🏾
Brad, I love seeing you so happy and sharing that joy! BTW, I love your own hair!
I love Jenna phipps
The first chick looks 10 years younger! Gorgeous!
I pay $6 at great clips ans my hair looks bomb every time 😂❤
Would a butterfly cut work for someone who only parts their hair on the side instead of the middle?
Lumps bumps and humps 😂
Hairdressers only be mad cus people that don't do the shit exactly like u said and mess up their hair and have to go get it fixed at the salon lol.  It's not like it's your mistakes it's the people that did it the themselves.  I think it's awesome you do this!  I'm to chicken shit to cut my own hair cus I cut my Alstralian Shepard's hair one time just to thin her hair out for summer a lil bit and cus her lil butt hair was so long and thick it looked like she had a stuffed animal stuck to her ass lol so I gave her a nice bubble bath and cut her hair and tried all these different ways like pulling it out and angeling it and just cutting regular and whatever I could do to not make it look choppy and OMG when her hair dried it was freakin chop city lmfao, luckily her hair grows supper fast so it wasn't bad for long lol.  Anyways since then I will never attempt to cut my hair or anyone or anythings hair lol. Like I even tried to make it look less choppy when it was dry and I just made it worse lol sooo that's that lol.  I do color my hair at home but I have always been super good with that and never had any regrets (I did work at a salon for a bit as a "shampoo girl" when we was in school and I actually mixed and applied color (I wasn't supposed to but they got supper busy so much and had me do it all the time) with the help and guidance of the stylist tho so I got really good with knowing types of hair and how to color and mix colors an all that jazz.  Im 46 now and just reminiscing bout that job back in the day made me smile!  I had so much fun with my hair back then (I still do alil these days)I would color my hair with this I think it was kinda like a temporary color but it seemed like a semi permanent I don't remember but the name of it was ShadesEQ(don't remember the spelling lol)anyways I had different color hair ALL the time lol.  Anyways great vid baby,thanks for all u do Brad!!  Much love, G🤗💜😘💋
i’ve been able to keep up my wolf cut for a hella minute because of you , got my hair looking🔥🔥😩 thank you for what you do!!!!!

I love your shirt!
Honestly, this cut and method are fairly forgiving. It’s very straightforward. Flattering to most hair types. Maybe ultra curly wouldn’t be great. But straight or wavy hair are cake.
You went all the way to Sally beauty supplies, didn't get any hair ties, what a surprise, that sure isn't wise 🎤🎤
Brad, please react to mia maples' haircut you'll love it 🤌🏻🤌🏻🤌🏻
Hi you kind of look sunburned… hope you are ok
Lol you deserve every bit of hate you get. ✌️ You're just ruining peoples hair and then making money commenting on it.
“it’s about 6 inches and 2 hairs” 🤣
And once again Brad ages backwards 10 years <3
ahhh I wanna try this! I cut my own hair last October right after a professional didn't give me what I asked for, and it was a win/fail...but with that little learning experience I think I could pull this off, and it's much simpler than the "grown out wolf cut" cut that I did...I have very thick & full hair, that grows sooo fast (thanks good hair genes from my family) so it frequently needs trims & layers ands is hard to manage. but watching all these girls do it & Brad's optimism for encouraging us to do at-home cuts (while following instructions thoroughly of course) it's giving me the motivation to just do it. Plus, it's Spring now and I'm definitely feeling the itch for something fresh & new. Already cleaned out my closet yesterday, why stop there?
they're just made you're makin tutorials good enough that you're takin clients rendering them obsolete
I had the moost crap day of my life.. Like be run over by a truck jump in front of a train vibe. (have that sometimes cuz of my boyfriend) but I saw the video and clickt play.. their I was back in business or well feeling happy(worth while) again 😃 thanks 😃
Bro try some hemp milk its fire and will complement your matcha just as good :D
I feel like a lot of hairdressers give brad a hard time because they are fixing bad hair decisions that people have made because of following Brad Mondo, however we all know from watching people do it on the internet that many people don't actually follow Brads advice and steps correctly so its not fair to give brad 100% of the blame on that. Also, people who are following a Brad Mondo tutorial to cut their own hair are likely the type of people who would cut their hair at home regardless of Brad anyways.
Jenna in the thumbnail 🤩
As for the oat milk thing… It could be carrageenan in it you’re having problems with and/or trace amounts if gluten (if it’s not certified gluten-free).  Oats can have trace amounts of gluten due to coming in contact with wheat at some point. 🤷‍♀️  Also, I’m going to be buying your hair color for the first time. I have a box dye of a specific color that I like but for obvious reasons I don’t want to use it anymore! I cannot wait! Alsooo… my sister does hair for her job (she’s wicked talented and the company she works for… she’s WAY too good for them and they don’t deserve her!). She’s gonna freak when I dye my hair with your hair color! I miss her experimenting with my hair before she went to school (we were in high school). She’s not one of the mad hairdressers! She likes you😂
My daughter did this cut. It looks so good on her!!!!
alright i guess i gotta cut my hair by myself again
Yo i got a hair cut idea.... Its like the karen cut.... But like way better. Lets see like loooong in thr front a short and choppy in the back..... Like AURORA meets Karen meets a fairy..... Idk........ Could u try to make it happen???
i want to have blonde hair
as a curly hair girl, can I just do the top part?  Or is that crazy?
I wanna try this cuz I literally cannot afford a haircut due to inflation. I haven't gotten a cut in THREE YEARS!
My friend did this hair cut a few weeks ago. you would have died if you'd seen it. She killed it. she looked so fabulous. and she's pregnant. so yeah. just a damn gorgeous thing you did for her
Omg you standing up for people! YASSSSSSS! Thank you for not being an elitest gatekeeper! It's actually not only great for people who can't afford, or don't wanna, but it's an accessibility thing too! It can be hard to get to a hairdresser with ADHD... it takes way to much executive function 😅
At 71, I followed you instructions and I am thrilled with the result!  I cut off 8” and I now have so much movement in my hair, it looks fab. I put rollers in it yesterday and it looks amazing.  Thank you, so much!
stop saying rachet. It’s embarrassing.
Brad. You did her so dirty at 9:10 😂
YES!!! Brad! Fuck those angry stylists! I watched some of them and all they did was annoy me. Just salty and really couldn't watch more than a couple🙄
Hairdressers harassing you be jealous of your success and confidence.
Beautiful AND funny❤️ !!!!!
I _can_ imagine being allergic to oat milk, because it does a number on my guts 😣 and it DOES BLOW. I’m also lactose intolerant, so whatevenismylife??? 🤦🏻‍♀️😣😆 PS: if it wasn’t for your tutorials, I’d just have long, stringy cat lady hair. So, for me at least, you aren’t impacting hairdressers at all.
Love your videos, keep up your great work Brad, love you.❤️
Jenna has been featured! I knew this would happen and am so happy! She deserves the exposure she works so so hard! The dyeing result was good too!
Gorg❤❤❤❤❤
Well damn, Brad you look cute af today. Oh also great video... 😏
I was scared😮 especially since when I cut the front it was longer then the back. Kept calm and followed instructions to the T and it totally works. Thank You!!!!😊❤😊
I watched Jenn's Phipp's hair transformation when it first came out (bc I love her!) but it was so fun watching Brad talk it out - and that freeze frame at 6:11 is everything
Hairdressers are only mad bc they’re afraid you’re gonna put them out of a job 😅 they know people cut their hair at home and fuck it up and they’re banking on getting money from fixing those fucked up haircuts. Or they just want to deter anyone from doing it at all so they’ll have to pay the hairdresser from the jump.   Shit like that is why so many people distrust hairdressers and won’t go to one to begin with. When you want people to remain helpless and incapable of taking care of themselves so that you can exploit it and make money off of them, you’re not a good person. Period. Especially when we’re talking about how many people couldn’t do their hair at all during the pandemic lockdown and were deeply depressed about it.
Hey Brad ! Could you do a tutorial for see-through bangs pleaseeee ???
Hey Brad MATCHA + COCONUT MILK also slaps....if you aren't allergic give that a try
💜 for Jenna Phipps!!!!
I know who this was for 😅
We love the way you are Brad don’t ever change we appreciate all the tools and techniques that you give us. People are mad just because we love you
Great job Nicole !!! Your attitude is infectious.
comin in with the tea in the intro. Aint no way i'm going to a salon. I prefer to cut my hair at home!!!! I save so much money! and it's fun! so thank you for giving us some tips and tricks, brad!!
I am convinced, I can do this lol
Brad 1- haters 0 🖕🖕🖕
APRIL!!!!!!! 🤣🤣
OK I am so going to try this. My hair is like the gal with the silver and my hair is long and thin baby fine. I am almost 74. I am going to try doing this tonight.
Nice job !!! Cutting it three times is crazy brave.
I love you reviewed nicol concilio. Love her!
i love jenna phipps!!!
Oat milk allergy? Could you be gluten sensitive or have Celiac disease? Check the oat milk you've been using to see if it has gluten. Or maybe it had just gone bad. I had some oat milk that made me really sick, but it was before the sell by date - very sussy.
Jenna phipps! Love her
One question: Can this haircut work with dread locks?
Brad I love that you're wearing a butterfly jumper 😂
Not me wanting to do this rn
Love it
I have curly hair, a mixture of 2b and 2c. Just touching my shoulders. Would this work for me? My hair is currently all the same length so when I wear it down and curly it looks like a lampshade. Some advice would be really appreciated ❤
I gave my sister bangs and a wolf cut w ur help 😅❤
I think this just convinced me to try the butterfly cut on myself 👀
I honestly don't care what "professional hair dressers" say about you, you're so entertaining and positive, and that's why I enjoy watching you!
I have curly hair and it bounces a lot every time I get a cut so I might try this Also, my hair is kind of thick, so does it work on Thicker Hair idk
17:19 okay she obviously is doing this on purpose for more attention lol. I like how she pre planned this, knowing that Brad would react to this! 😂
At 3:11, what is the name of that curling tool she was using?
Brad. Does this work on thin hair? Like I don't have much hair. I have had the size of peoples one point (out of two)
Brad I’ve used your tutorials for my whole family. I’ve gave my daughter so many cuts and dyes.. some turned out., some not so much. lol 😂 no hate! And I learned how to perfect my mens haircuts., I now cut all the mens hair in my family too.
Cashewwwww milk. It’s just as creamy
the hairdressers that be hating are the ones that messed up my hair time and time again :/  i used your shag tutorial and thats my go to~
The second gurl, OMG yasss cut that damage off! YAY!
This is the haircut I desperately want and I showed my hair dresser picture examples and did not get what I asked for, I’m about to do it myself 😅
I had a go and followed your tutorial to the letter. I’ve never taken scissors to my own hair but omg, I absolutely love it!❤❤ my ends were deader than dead and I just couldn’t afford to get them gone 🤷‍♀️ I was terrified but this style is so me. Thank you mr mondo, it’s sooo good to see you back 🎉🎉
Here's how my Monday is going: my earring fell between the seat & the side of the recliner so I went to the back sat on the floor & commenced to lift the chair up by the wooden back. As I reached under with my left hand the right decided to just "let go" & I got smacked right in the face with that same wooden back. I now am the proud owner of a 'monkey bump' on my left forehead. 😥& so it is...
Your sooo funy 😂😂😂😊
I watched your video this morning in the shower and I couldn't control myself I did the butterfly cut in about 10 mins 😅 turns out sooooo good, all day I kept feeling my hair bouncing around 😍 love it
I'm doing it! I have old-person fine hair to my waist. Because I have depression, I have not been to the hairdresser for like 2 years. I need at least 4 inches off to get rid of the dead ends. My hair is also not layered, so I want some body back in. WISH ME LUCK!
Brad Mondo is fine as Hell. 🤘🏿
They are listening n coming out great wow
If hairdressers want clients then they should try being nice when you come in. For the last few years, every time I have tried going to a salon, they are so rude and giving me shit about my hair. I wash it too much. My braids and buns are damaging it. I know that but I still have to live me life. I know it has been a rough few years for everyone but, why would I go and pay that much money for someone to make me feel bad about myself? No thanks. I will just do it myself. I'm not going to sit there and smile while you "joke" about getting clippers and buzzing my head. Anyway, your tutorials have been so helpful so I can do a modified wolf cut on myself. Plus all the layers make me looks like I have so much more hair when for my whole life hairdressers have been telling my that my hair is too thin for layers.
Fuck those hairstylists!!! 🤬 They do not have exclusive rights to the knowledge of hairdressing, they need to get over themselves.
I'm a hairdresser and I don't see anything wrong with you helping ladies do their hair at home. I'm so glad you're back.
Thank you Brad for this tutorial, I have thin straight hair and it helped me with gross ends and flat look. Last time I requested a layered haircut from a salon I got a very retro looking cascade type cut and didn't really like it on me. So I decided to mess it up myself (with a little help from a friend with the sectioning) and liked it so much more! Sorry, hairdressers, but Brad is superior!
Brad if you’re having issues with Oat milk maybe try Almond milk? My daughter who’s 7 loves it! She won’t drink anything else other than almond milk! Xx
Thank god ur back 😪😪😪 i watch ur videos when I’m alone n I’ve just been rewatching videos like crazy. I hope u don’t go permanently only breaks thanks lol❤
Боже, какой же клоун... Вот эти постоянные кривляния и напыщенность с высоким самомнением очень отталкивают(
I just did this cut for the second time two days ago, and it turned out GREAT!  I started w/Brad's basic self-cut tutorial when COVID hit. Just moved to the country in Dec, and it's 45 minutes to any place, even like a Great Cuts. The "fancy" stylists around are doing some out of date type of work based on social media posts others have made. I'm not paying extra for a 2000 style haircut, and Brad's Butterfly looks better than a Great Clips cut. Plus it saves sooooo much time and hassle. PS- I have natural curls/waves.
I think people are too serious about hair. Yes, it can be very important, but there's really no harm in playing around at home and experimenting. If I mess up my hair, that's on me.
I'm a hair style idiot. What's the difference between a wolf cut and butterfly cut?
Every time i watch these videos, I want to cut my hair! 😂
We are always going to do our hair at home anyways so thank you for helping us!
Literally did it 5 hours before you upload this video
They are just jealous of your brilliantness!!💕
MATCHA WITH COCONUT MILK AND LIGHT VANILLA SYRUP. TRUST.
*Like if you want Brad to teach more on how to do dudes' hair when it's past chin length.* So it doesn't look ~feminine~ (if that's what you're into, of course) Also, NO clue how to do women's hair if it's like at pixie length. I know how to cut hair, but NO clue how to do short women's hair. I'm decent at dudes hair, but Brad still has like zero guy tutorials.
brad try taking Lactaid   tablets
Jenna!! 🤣😁👍
Brad, I’m concerned, you don’t look well. X
✨️🙌😺so good to see you back here on YT, handsome! & may I say: you're looking mighty FRESSHH from your you-time & new hair!!!❣️
I followed your butterfly tutorial literally last night, it looks amazing!! I def didn’t take off quite enough but it still came out with fantastic layers! Thanks Brad :)
The butterfly cuts are so amazing
Trueee hairdressers are going crazy over this haircut, but as someone who hasn’t found a nice hairdresser, I’ve been cutting my hair for so long now, and I tried the butterfly cut and looooove it so much! So yeah, thank you Brad for doing the tutorial 🤩🤩🤩
omg where is his hoodie from 😍
I followed your butterfly cut tutorial and it turned out great, I love it!
I actually really love doing the butterfly hair cut , it seems to be the only hair cut I've find that suites me well. 🖤🖤 Love watching you . and all your videos .
During lockdown, I remember hairdressers strongly advising against cutting your own hair because you could mess it up. I agree for dyeing, because if your hair is long, it could stay there for a long time and cause problems. But I feel like cutting your own hair is fine! Of course it can go a bit wrong but it's also fun and it grows back. Go do it and enjoy!
Definitely get an allergy test. You may have a sensitivity to a certain grain/ingredient vs an allergy. Or maybe celiac disease. It is worth a look. Best of luck to you! Thanks for the content and welcome back!! 🫶🏾
Some of us are antisocial and poor and shiz ya know? Love you Brad, don't let the other hairdressers get you down ❤ I'm so much more confident when I feel the need to chop my hair thanks to you
I love Brad Mondo 😊
All the hair dressers that tell you that you should keep this to yourself clearly aren’t very talented. If they were then they’d give the advice and people would still come to them for a professional job done.   You’re a real hero brad and tbh I’m a little biased because you remind me so much of my brother. Love the hair btw and keep being your kind self.
Oh how I've missed this 🖤
Not everyone wants to or is able to go to the salon. It's not like if you stopped making tutorials then we will all be forced to go. It's your hair do what you want with it.
Brad I did the Wolf and have bangs. I am 65 and love it! Get tons of complements. I have always done my own hair. It has been my best feature.
Idk why hairstylist get mad at him ppl are gonna cut their hair at home wether or not he makes his tutorials honestly people know the risk of doing it at home plus hair grows back if they fuck it up and they either learn their lesson and go to a hair salon or it’s not that important to them also some people can’t afford haircut for their whole household so there’s some up side to diy haircuts if you need too js… also they could make money on fixing ppls hair (salons) 😅
Okay, now I'm confused on the layers thing. I like my hair in the range of just past my chin to just brushing my shoulders. I used to get layers, but then I HATED when my hair was straightened. I realized the layers made my face look super round. I already look young (I'm 31, but everyone guesses I'm a freshman in college), so I get a blunt haircut now without layers. I thought I looked better and less like a babyface. Help! I'm questioning everything now haha.
JENNA!!
I totally followed your tutorial for the butterfly cut. I didn't film it but it turned out flawless 🤌🏻🤌🏻  Also, you're so handsome! ❤
I'm fucking loving Brad's attitude 😅👏🏼
Its my sign to do this haircut again & trim my bangs 🤍
My mother did the butterfly cut on my younger sister, It came out decent lol. Although she gets very nauseous from holding her head down like that for a long time (10 minutes). Does anyone know of any tricks to help someone like that? (Btw my father also faints while getting his hair cut, so maybe its genetic?)
So glad you reacted to Jenna! I watch her channel as well and was waiting for this!
Shows how shit of a cutter you are 🎉
idk what I did but one side doesn't have all the face framing layers like the other side does. The left side is perfect but the right side is just not it. I had to add them afterwards and I'm worried it's too choppy. I was having flashbacks to that time I got an undercut bc I was hot. It took 2 years to grow out enough to blend in with the rest of my hair. I'm loving the butterfly cut and I love that everyone is finally moving away from flat ironing their hair pin straight. Volume, layers, curls, curtain bangs... so 90s, so ethereal, so flattering, more natural and healthier looking.
As a broke grad student, your butterfly cut tutorial has been a lifesaver. I feel like I can still look put together without breaking the bank! The thing I struggle with is when I want to shorten my length a bit and do the 🦋cut 😅 also love the hoodie, on theme 😊
I disagree. Blunt cuts look great in my opinion. Especially for thin hair. My thin hair looks chopped with layers.
I'm actually really terrible at making appointments, so I decided to cut my own hair. I had my mother cut some length off because there's no way I'm cutting that straight without help. I did the wolf cut and it turned out really nice, but next time I'm trying the butterfly cut to see which I like better. Thank you Brad!
Dear Brad, With your issue with oatmilk, may I suggest trying soy milk or almond milk.
I'm glad you addressed those hairstylists! I'm happy you rose above them! I saw what they said about you in reddit when you were away for the last 3 months. They were nasty 😢 But you proved you are way above them. Thank you for these tutorials, Brad!
APRIL! Don’t ever do that again! Lolllll
I feel the oat allergy HARD. Literally the only two (common) milks I can use are coconut and chickpea. I highly recommend Ripple. Its not as sweet and doesn’t have the coconut taste
😂😂😂😂
6 inches and about two hairs 😭😭😂😂
Brad! Try coconut milk with your matcha 🍵 xxx
🎉🎉🎉 love Jenna Philips
Im kinda sad no one failed this time
The hairdressers hating on Brad need to realize that I would have come to them if i could afford it but now they've exposed themselves as haters and they're never touching my aura again with that negativity
Side note.. when is the XMONDO app coming out 👀😅
Jenna!!!
I'm so jealous!  I can't do a butterfly cut!
Would love to send you a picture of my butterfly hair cut I did using your tutorial!! I did you proud and it looks pretty good in my opinion. Because I did it to cut off a bad bleach job I had to get more cut so went to a hairdresser And even she said she was impressed with how straight it was in the back SO THANK YOU!!!
Has anyone tried this with really thick hair? Does it work also?
Thumbs up for what you have said to the out raged hair dressers! I am a retired hair dresser here. I think people should just stop already with telling people and giving people crap about cutting thier own hair. The prices people charge for cuts or pretty much all services are ridiculous! Alot of people can not afford to pay them! Love to you all out there!
Just keep in mind, if we don't want to go to a hair dresser, we are not going to. Whether or not we have your tutorials lol, so thank you for giving us something to do it semi properly and have some sort of style.
I missed your content so much!
Love you Braaaaddd!! 👏👏👏
hairdresser here, with no hate! although i have had to blend and correct a handful of these diy cuts.   while this is a great option it’s usually just not as detailed and personalized as *some* professional haircuts   If you find yourself fighting your hair or fighting the style, it may be the cut
oat milk allergy?? as a vegan?? babe i use oat milk for everything idk how you'd cope like what you gonna use?? soya? 💀🤧
You might not be allergic to the oat milk it self, but some add pea protein and maybe try a different oat milk with less ingredients. Some oat milks mess with me too.
I feel personally attacked 🤣🤣🤣🤦‍♀️
Eff them haters!! We love you, Brad!! 💕
Love you Brad Mondo❤ and about the oat milk....this is one alternative (I looked it up lol) Flax milk can be simply substituted for oat milk in many recipes, as they have a similar consistency. You can also easily find it in supermarkets and specialty health stores. Furthermore, it has positive attributes such as having fewer carbs than dairy and being rich in omega-3 fatty acids Hope that's helpful❤
I love your vibe today Brad
I think it's funny all these girls happened to have fine hair so the layers made it look fuller and lively. I've done the butterfly cut, but for the opposite reason. I have too much hair and having layers makes it not look weighed down and it's not as hot
I will not pay a hairdresser 200€ for not doing what I asked them to do, especially not in this cost of living crisis… The audacity some hairdressers have to say „I also have to like the result“ and not do what you asked them to… so please keep them tutorials coming!
I'm a broke arse queer who works full time and can't afford medication, let alone a haircut, my clippers and I would love some more DIY masculine style tutorials too!
Brad, are you gluten intolerant? Oats are a big problem in the gluten-free community because a lot of them are contaminated by the way they're processed. Purity protocol oats are one of the few safe options out there, and I honestly don't think many of the oat milk companies use them right now. (I found about 2-3 on Google, but they're not any of the "mainstream" brands you'll see in the refrigerated section at the store.) You might try buying some purity protocol oats (I like Grainful) and making your own oat milk. Then, see if you have a reaction. :)
Jenna is one the most relaxing and chill youtuber i love her ❤️ and I'm so glad that Brad is back
Whenever your peers 😏😏 attack, then it means you're the BEST! 🤩🤩🤩 Your videos have help me so much, Thank you for being you & never ever stop!!! 🥇🥇🥇
I did Brad’s butterfly 🦋 cut last week after seeing his video. My hair is very long & thick so it took me 20 minutes to get the parts as sharp as I could. I even kept rewinding the video to make sure I followed his tips perfectly. I love it. It turned out so nice. I didn’t go too short(5inches) my main goal was to shape my face & get rid of the blunt ends. Love the layers & even when I let it air dry, it looks really pretty 😍 Brad is my hairdresser now-lol
I love watching these and we appreciate you! You always tell us to live our extra lives and you give us the power to do that so thank you
I've been doing butterfly cuts on both of my girls for all of quarantine!
So happy you’re back to regularly posting on here Brad!! Woot woot!! 🎉❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hmmm maybe I should try this at home. I’ve not had a professional hair cut in almost 2 years
I wish he would react to Mia Maples doing her butterfly cut
Missed you Brad. It makes me happy to see your content back in my feed. I love you, and how you support us guys/dolls.
You might not be allergic to oat milk but possibly the thickeners in it if you buy store bought. Oats are hypoallergenic the chance of you being allergic is very low, but still possible of course. Make your own with just oats and water and see if it causes a reaction.
Monologue incoming, excuse me. I have curly hair and I suffer from eczema on my scalp. I live in Southeast Asia, and I’ve been to all sorts or hairdressing shops from salons to barber shops. Each time I end up with an ugly haircut or even worse, with my hair waayyy shorter than I intended it to be. It is also highly embarrassing to be scolded or treated like a dog with mange (it is extremely humid in my country so managing my scalp health is a constant battle). It got to the point I had long hair which was mostly crispy looking. It was badly in need of a cut but I couldn’t bring myself to go get it done professionally. With the butterfly cut you featured on your channel I was able to give myself a much needed trim in the safety of my home, no extra embarrassment needed! And it turned out great! Of course if I found a good salon I would go there. But in the interim your advice worked out great
I love how brad goes like "How did you do this???? it looks so good!" when it was literally HIM that taught us how to do it XD ♥ love him for that! haha
at home smart asses all think they can do anything ..until they start doing the thing.  no matter the planning we see we need help..but we keep going...cause..smart asses.  hey Brad, next video, show us how to use that rat tail comb for taking sections for coloring or bleaching...show us the typical 3 types, small, med, and large so we can see how they work and how much hair is in their respective section types.  show us how to use the combs when bleaching roots on hair that already has bleached length.
coconut milk?
Brad you helped me through covid love you
I followed the butterfly tutorial only after a hairdresser didn’t give me layers like I asked for. Not gonna lie, I don’t love it, but it’ll put me on till I’m well enough to go further for a better hairdresser 😂
is there any tutorials for shorter hair, like, shoulder length? the cuts look fantastic! but my hair doesn't go all the way up from the back. Do I just do the apex to front part? or maybe both but not worry about the hair that is left behind? Will that still work?
As a mother of 2 who is broke all the time I gotta say this butterfly cut has been a life saver! Ty Brad so much!!!
I made a video on it and a hair stylist on my friends list called me tacky😢😂
Brad, I've missed your videos! Please don't stop doing them, they bring such joy to our lives.... but take care of yourself first!
i really needed to this rn cause im feeling super sad but u've helped <3 thanks
I can think of ONE hairdresser in particular that just spew some hateful comments towards you, and honestly... I will never follow him because of his toxic behavior. You can share constructive criticism and educate people without being nasty. I'm sorry that you're getting so much hate for no reason. At the end of the day, it's hair, it's just hair, and if people want to experiment on their own, it's their choice. I dye my own hair at home, bleach and everything, and my haidresser never made me feel like I should go see her instead. That's how it should be. Life is expensive. We need to save those coins 😂
Brad...We need more #CURLYHAIR cutting tutorials!😃✨️ because we want to achieve layers without loosing our length as well!
Brad!!!! Use almond milk instead . It will change your life . I’m allergic to oat milk too. ❤
Saw Jenna and ive never clicked so fast
Thank you! I have very little money right now and can’t afford to go to the salon, so watching your videos helped me immensely! I went from hair that was down the middle of my back, to a long bon with layers and curly or straight it is fire and I get a lot of compliments. My next cut will probably be done by a professional, but now I can save up for it. 😊
YES!!!!  Finally....   I am so proud of you Brad..  I've been waiting for you to pop off!  Nice touch slipping it in mid video.  I LOVE YOU!!!!!  STAND TALL, BLONDE, XTRA AND BEAUTIFUL BABE!!!!
Every time I watch you brad I have a strong urge to cut my hair…
I’m a mother who doesn’t always have the money for a hairdressers price these days or time to leave my baby since everyone in my life works as well, the butterfly haircut has saved my butt. Thank you!!!
Time for a trim!
the first girl looks like hunter Schafer
Brad, I just wanted to say that thank you for the tutorial on your butterfly haircut😭 my hair fr turned out perfect, love you Brad❤️
Fk em Brad, you do you. We ❤ you.
I NEED YOUR HELP. I'm on cancer meds. And my hair is thinning and dry. What product can I use for my curly hair???❤❤❤
I don’t see why hair dressers were pretending to be mad at you. According to them you’re giving them work. I think they might be telling on themselves because as any diy person knows, you are taking a RISK and the only time you don’t go to the salon is when it works. Which is the only reason showing this stuff would be a true cash flow problem. 😅
Butterfly cut was MADE for curly hair - curls get happy, bouncey, keep the curls, the volume just a big yes.
Coconut milk is great with Matcha tea..❤❤❤
Is there some easy hack to give layers to a bob? I just went to the salon paying 90 bucks, showed my hairdresser a pic of a really structured bob and for some reason he gave me a straight bob without any layers and it just makes me look soooo bland 😭 of course I said I love it cuz I'm an idiot and didn't wanna hurt anyone's feelings....🤷‍♀️
Love the butterfly hoodie, perfect for the butterfly cut video lol
She did great 👍🏼 looks nice
i’m sorry but i don’t understand why they’d be angry, not everyone can get to a salon, i have extreme anxiety so the thought of going to the hairs dressers is impossible for me so your tutorials really save my hair
This has become my go to haircut, it gives me the layers and length I want super easy! I love how easy it is for me to understand which makes it also very easy to customise my hair even further!
Thanks for the tutorials!
What the filler did you do to your face?!
BRAD PLEASE WHERE IS YOUR HOODIE FROM
omg and BRAD HAS GOT BARS!! DO A SONG WITH ME BISH 🤩😂
Brad, you mentioned you might be allergic to oat milk.  Little known fact: people with celiac disease (gluten free is essential) can also react negatively to oats.  I tried for years to bake with ‘clean oats’ (trendy term: in this case choosing oats which have not been processed in the same building as wheat) but I still reacted (digestive upset, blistery looking ulcers on skin). Brad, investigate this.  💜☺️
btw shoutout to the BEAUTIFUL PPLS who be exactly like me and feel like a hairdresser after 1 damn video 🤣🤣
oh yes. ppl giving you shade for helping ppl that dont have the money for a hair salon... so harmful. yes, there are ppl who abuse the advice that probably shouldnt be taking the advice in the first place.thats literally what the whole world does on a daily basis with every situation lol. BUT, all in all, at the end of most of the fails you watch, you tell the person who has made the video to go to a goddamn hairdresser if they fucked up looool.  like you just wanted to help out a broke bish like me 🤣sheesh. i laugh at whoever giving brad hate fr.  Love you Brad <3 been watching your channel for like 5 years <3
The butterfly hoodie for watching butterfly haircuts 👌🏻
I have had a similar situation with oatmilk. I found out it's a specific ingredient called carrageenan. Just buy a different oatmilk brand that doesn't have it.
More than likely you’re not allergic to oat milk just the pesticides they spray on the oats.  Try organic oat milk 🤷🏼‍♀️
“APRIL!”😂
These were sooo good. Satisfying asf🫡
What about nut milk? or coconut milk? lots of options :)
A lil tip for anyone looking to get face framing layers: When u tell ur hairstylist what u want, don't say layers. They will usually give u a shaggy cut if u do. Ask for "angles" around ur face & at the bottom. After I started saying "angles," they understood way better. Just tell them where u want the angles. Believe me, it changes everything. 😋
I dis this cut too. It was too long to manage. I cut 5 inches but tbh in few weeks I'll cut more. They day after I bought thinning scissors bc even with undercut my hair is too thiccccc.
Brad looks a little stoned tbh 😅
I just did this about a month ago and I absolutely love it
Almond milk is quite good 😅
So high
He's high
this cut is the reason is why i am growing my hair out! 😁💚
I was screaming at Brad when he said Nicole should cut more hair, because he just had talked about how curly hair bounced back. It’s really a struggle we have and we know our hair. If you cut half an inch more, you could messed up the hairstyle and growing curly hair is such a pain the ass because of the bouncing back
I hate hairdressers. Been doing my own hair since I was a kid and my teens friends think I’m a hair dresser because her hair and colour is better than there’s 😂
If you gonna put so many stupid ads I'll just skip to the good parts of the video. Seriously, there's no quality left in any of the Youtube videos just them fuckin ads ads ads
I love how ❤encouraging you are 🥰 You’re like a proud Mom/Dad
Maybe soy milk is a bit similar to oat in my opinion. My fav is coconut but it's very different from oat milk
"It's about 6 inches... and two hairs" - Brad Mondo 😅😅
Don’t drink oat milk! I don’t know how people drink it anyway, it’s literally flour and water! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hey Brad I miss your videos❤
Nicole killed it!
The vision is coming to life 🎵🔥
Omg I love Jenna ❤
❤😎
I'm so happy to see all the uplifting comments for Brad ,Hate on social media can really affect your mental health, Sending you huge hugs Brad you keep doing you and living your extra life ,The amount of subscribers should talk for itself
Try almond milk or coconut milk instead of you don't want to do dairy almond milk is good I use it in smoothies 🥰
That second girl needs a BIGGG CHOP THO
MOST hair stylist cannot do what I ask for. BEEN messed up so much. YOU GET SLANTED layers whwn wanting square.
I'm waaay past due for a haircut and I have very fine, thinning hair. Maybe I should do this? IDK, I'm scared lol
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Okay, Jenna and Brad on my screen!! My two faves!
Hi, I love your Xmondo colours, but I am from the Czech Republic, are u planning to ship to Europe anytime soon? 😍❤❤❤
TBH, I am damn tired of paying $200 to get the cut I've been wanting for years and walking away without it!! 😅 I'm so happy to see Ya back, Brad!! 💓 I actually did the gypsy and butterfly combo cut. 🎉  Edit: I watched Jenna Phipps do your cut on her YT channel. 😅
I’m so glad you’re back! Can we hang out sometime? 🙌🏻
I just followed your tutorial and it turned out so good I love it❤
No more Beeps Brad...You didnt half as many beeps before......
Maybe you are not allergic to oat milk, but gluten, but otherwise try soya milk, it tastes so good 👌🥰
I think that was kind of unfair. I once commented that you should also be supporting hairdressers since you started out as a hairdresser and know how hard we work and how much training we go through. You also make money off us and all the people who watch you. Im a long-time watcher, never miss a video and also tell my clients that haven't heard about you, about tour channel. I'm just trying to make a living, and you would be worth a million times more than me, and you say f#*k you? That's a bit unfair. 😢
Ooh yes I also had to stop with the oatmilk. It really hurt my stomach. Makes sense though bc oatmeal also hurt me.   I finally stopped going to the hair salons a few years ago bc I had so many bad experiences there. And at different ones..didn't cut my hair right. Some were so touch on my scalp I'd leave with headache. Didn't color it right..etc. and so expensive. So now I do it all myself
Brad please react to denitslava hair cut
You make us feel like we can do it all 😂😂😝
I didn't do a video but it did my own hair using your butterfly cut tutorial and it turned out so good. I wish hairstylists wouldn't get so upset...I have very severe social anxiety to the point where I almost fainted once getting my hair done so...yeah...I think it's great to give people options to do this themselves 😭
"Brad Mondo does it this way" is the modern day "my mom is a hair dresser and she says..." And that's why we hate you. There's plenty of money to go around, but your content simultaneously underminds and underhand compliments  hairdressers. I just enjoy the fuck ups
❤ love you Brad!
Stylists should be happy there are people coming in for them to fix the mistakes they made cutting their hair at home, if it goes wrong.
I cut my hair by myself....  And it was the first time i cut by looking for a proper tutorial and it was urs on my birthday and it was a GREAT success 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Lmao, legit just watched this video and then went and did it. Still wet, so we'll see how it goes when it's dry. YOLO, am I right kids?
as someone who has constantly not gotten what i paid for i now cut my own thing. Thanks Brad <3 But now with a mate in hairdressing school i am finally going to start letting someone else cut my hair
From my past experiences with dying and cutting my hair myself at home, I now fully rely on professional hairstylists to cut and color my hair. 🤷🏼‍♀️ But I do admire those that are able pull of being their own hairstylists! 🫶🏼
Oat milk messed me up.. but almond milk or coconut milk does the job 😉.. also I did buttetfly cuts on myself, and my two daughters 6 and 14! We all look fabulous following your tutorial ❤❤❤ thank you Brad! Btw, garnet on my hair is 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Almond or hemp milk 👍
Love your butterfly shirt ❤
love you brad mondo for giving us all the free content real king of YouTube!
Brad Mondo NEVER SAID “don’t go to a hairdresser.” Not…once…
Brad in his anti-hero era and I'm here for it!
Brad: "the more you cut, the better it looks" Also Brad, visibly panicking: "you're cutting SO MUCH!"  I love Brad 😂
What are the chances I just followed your tutorial today… and then come to see you posted this as well 😂 i love my new cut fyi!
Hairdressers hate on Brad because he’s putting them out of business 😭😆  I have learned so much about hair since I started watching brads videos years ago. I think the last time I went to the hair salon was a little more than 10 years ago.
I was hanging out in my little sister's room about a month ago. My hair was just below my shoulders, choppy and layered since I had been growing it out from a pixie cut. That night, my hair was in a loose ponytail, and my *ten year old* sister told me I'd look good with a sort of shorter layered bob-wolf-cut thingy or whatever. At the time, I hated my hair, as it was constantly in the way and always frizzy and quite hard to wash, so I told her to cut it. She has told me about a bunch of the skills she learns from your videos, and surprisingly, the haircut she gave me was actually incredible, considering her age. Our parents, who are usually very upset by us giving ourselves haircuts, were actually quite pleased, and commented multiple times on how good it looked. Inspired by you, she wishes to be a hairdresser when she grows up. Thank you, Brad Mondo, for giving my sister these kinds of hopes and dreams, and also these skills that she can actually use and help people with.
I actually enjoyed this more than the fail videos. It's so satisfying to see people be happy and proud of their results!
If all hairdressers would follow the directions given by their customers, I bet many of saif customers would not stop going to the salon and cutting, dyeing their own hair.  I also stopped going and went to do it at home because every single time, the stylist did not follow through with what I wanted and did their own thing.  A lil storytime for everybody who is interested: I had like really firetruck red hair for years and the first two times i did it like that, i went to a salon with color experts. The first salon i went to and described what I wanted, they wanted to give me a burgundy red. That Was not what i f#cking asked for. The second salon atleast understood what color I wanted so I made an appointment, got my hair done and at sole point the stylist must have mixed some pink in it and when I asked her she was like "yea I just thought it would look better". No! It is not about what you prefer ffs. Mind you I paid 180€ for a color i did not want nor like. So the third time i went to a salon to get it done was a different one with stylists doing like german celebrety hair. You'd think that they must have absolutetly nailed it and made my wish come true, right? Yaaa I bet I got you fooled on this one. Just know that I paid nearly 300€ for them to bleach the regrowth and put the red dye in. It was the red that I wanted and it looked really good. Atleast to the day I washed my hair for the first time. Mind you, it was a permanent dye, but most of the pigments fell out and i had a dark red, almost brown band on my hair. I was furious so i went there, told and showed them what happend and they we're like "oh yeah that looks really awful, but it does not look like something made by us. You probably did something to it afterwards".  It has been 3 days since I have left the salon and i had washed my hair ONCE with salon grade colorsafe products and I am at fault for their Bad work? Yeah come on, f#ck these guys imma do it myself from now on and weirdly enough, i've never had any Problems with my hair and color since then
I'm a hairdresser and I worked at salon for 13 years and it closed down so I went to a hairdresser to do my hair and I wasn't happy so now I do my own hair. I do highlights, cut and now I want to do balayage and my hair looks better now than when I worked at the salon
the way that there are angry hairdressers is so strange to me. people are gonna cut their hair regardless, so why not teach them how to do it right? will never understand the logic lol
Bro I've grown my hair and got attached to it I also gave myself bangs and thought it was really cute and then cut more and laughed so hard that I needed to tell my mom and dad and did crazy stuff with it XD
I just did this cut on my daughter! She loves it!
Use coconut milk NOT oat milk ... think about it - OATS are given to cows to FATTEN THEM UP ...... use coconut milk in your matcha.
God I have missed these videos. Wish I had seen this last week before my haircut. Love you Brad!
As soon as Jenna said what tutorial she was following I was PRAYING to the youtube algorithm to send her your way 😁😁😁😁😁😁
I love these videos.  So glad to have you back doing them!
Im sooo glad he finally addressed it! #teambradmondo
I have a question for you Brad, does this work on a side part ? Xxx
i look like a classical composer with volume and layers. stick straight hair is the moment for me
Today a stylist botched my haircut. It looks like stairs around my face. I will try to go to another place.
i did an asymmetrical butterfly cut for my undercut top length and it came out pretty fucking sweet
Thoughts on doing the butterfly cut with a side part? I only see middle part hairstyles with this cut!
Honestly I’m surprised Brad didn’t say anything about how the first video, the girl actually wet her hair. And even busted out a ruler! Give her her flowers 💐  All he did in the last butterfly video was passively aggressively complain that no one listens to him when he says wet your hair.  My how the tables have turned 😂 also the red or sunburn in his face is def making his eyes pop 😍
He called me beautiful ❤❤❤❤
So glad you are back. Don't burn yourself out. You are fabulous 🤩
I wanna do stuff like this because my ends are just deaaaad but I have naturally super curly hair and the more I cut off the tighter the curls go and the shorter my hair gets 😭😭
Omg I watch Jenna phipps!
Does the butterfly cut work with super thick hair?
What some of these hair dressers don't understand is literally some people can't afford it.  Like, we know you're worth every penny, but honey the money just. isn't. there.  Do you have any idea how many little girls and boys first day of school hair dreams I've made come true right in my own kitchen?! Prom dreams?  I have literally lost count.  And how many times have I been paid for it?  Once. ever.  And I don't even care, because I have been able to boost so many people's confidence.  Why should only people with money be able to have that?  Or how about the fact my son is on the spectrum, and has serious anxiety about a stranger cutting his hair?  I've even had friends bring THEIR friends to me after a literal salon screwed their hair up so badly, and I fixed it for them (they went back the next day, told them I fixed it in my kitchen and got a full refund;) ).  Your advice has been so invaluable for so many, me included.  I've been able to help so many because. of. you.  Thanks Brad, you're stellar <3 (And those stylist can take their hate and bill someone else for it ;) )
Hi brad you might have a problem with gluten, here in Australia oat milk is gluten free but in the US it isn’t, just check the labels carefully ❤
I have done this wonderful cut twice and its been an amazing change that I totally vibe with. I have had a lot of agitating experiences with the salons near me, so I like being able to rely on myself for my more stylized cuts. thank you for this wonderful tutorial!
LOVE Nicole!!! So happy this cut turned out great!
Tbh I am just glad your back I have watched so many of your videos
IM SOOO HAPPY TO SEE JENNAA HERE
Is there a similar haircut for shorter (shoulder length) hair? I can't tie my hair up. I love the layers but I went to a hairstylist and they fucked up my haircut 😭😭😭
I missed you a lot🎉🎉
I’m sorry to hear you’re allergic to oat milk Brad 😢 I am allergic too and I hate it. I don’t have an alternative but I just wanted to let you know you’re not alone lol ❤
Hey f those guys. We appreciate you!
maybe he should use almond vanilla milk instead of oat milk... if he has an allergy.... tastes about the same.
Okay wait, I was told since I have really fine hair that I should avoid layers and instead only do blunt cuts so my hair appears thicker. But if Brad says I can go back to layers, I’ma do it!
I did the cut but messed up the angle of cutting  and the position  of the ponytail  of the front  so the hair turned out  a Lil shorter  but with styling, it blended  well and curled  exactly  at my cheekbones   Thank you, Brad!❤
I wanna know if you wore the butterfly hoodie on purpose for this video 👀👀
I know your butterfly cut technique by heart!. I do it on my hair every 3 months. I also added your technique of curtain bangs to it. The only time I go to the salon is to get my hair colored. I cut my own hair now and I couldn’t be more grateful. 🤍.
I don’t oat milk or like it but I do drink almond milk I haven’t had real milk in years
For curly hair the butterfly cut is great for VOLUME!! it cuts in crown layers which helps with not having a flat head and the longest face framing layer should be just a little bit shorter than the back, it will blend nicely trust me. I legit just cut my hair yesterday and I am in love I finally got a 'fro going on
Brad I just love your reactions ❤
Omg I can’t believe Nicol was on your channel. She’s the sweetest ❤
The last girl warmed my heart with the "that's not my journey" comment about blunt ends 😂 too cute
Brad I love your hoodie ❤
So happy Brad is back, you can tell he's feeling much better and well rested and we love to see it! These last few videos have been well worth the wait!
The first person did so good!! Edit: EVERYONE DID SO GOOD
Look at you cute 🦋 shirt!!
You are honest and genuine and who cares what hair dresser people have to say!! Keep being you ❤❤
If I had the face for it and the courage, I would give your wolf cut a try.
I've missed you damn it. 😢
i’ve never cut my own hair but my ends are absolutely horrible. i’m doing this cut now after watching this. i have super straight thin hair & i need the layers!
I followed this tutorial the other day. I didn’t film it hahah. It could have turned out better if I had thinning shears and cut a little bit more off.
I love how happy he gets ❤❤😊😊
Try Vita Coco Coconut milk
Can’t believe hair stylists are getting angry! That’s ridiculous.
Have you tried banana milk yet?  It’s stupid good!
Dude! All these girls slayed it!! Yes!
lmao so glad you clapped back at those hairdressers!!
There are two types of hair dressers that hate Brad Mondo: the ones who try to tell you what you want is impossible, that you won’t look good a certain way, or try to talk you out of a big change. The other half are the ones who suck at color corrections and won’t admit it.
Ladies, you did beautifully!!! You should be so proud of yourselves!
You're truly helping hair styles be accessible. Alot of people cant afford to go to a salon but could afford a 10 $ set of scissors at sallys and some clips.   There will never be a shortage of people going to salons. Some people doing their own hair cuts at home wont harm the industry.
I did a butterfly cut in january because my hair is sooo thin, it really helped make it look like my hair was fuller. I regret not recording it. I am almost due for another hair cut.
Give ‘em shit Brad. You’re doing a great thing for all women. Love and cheers from 🇨🇦
You just be out here changing lives for the better Brad ❤
I trained as a hairdresser but I don't do it as a career I also don't really follow instructions when I cut my own hair I just go at it with the scissors 😂 I appreciate your videos because even though I trained as a hairdresser I never did it as a job so I don't have as many skills as you and profession hairdressers do, thank you for the videos ❤ I watch your videos because you're such a nice kind lovely person you are always teaching us what is best when it comes to hair 😊 hope you have a nice day\night from Emma in the UK ❤
My 12 year old wanted it, so we tried it. She has a lot of hair though. Like a lot of hair. And I think the thickness of it made the layers a bit too dense. She still liked it though and her hair grows so fast, so it's already looking better.
Struggling to see the difference between this and the wolf cut
could not be happier brad mondo is making reaction vids again lol ive been rewatching old ones for so long!!!! love love love
Binge watching your videos again!❤
period!
I didn't record it, but I did follow your tutorial and i was very happy with how it turned out.
I stand by that this should be called the unicorn cut😂
I love this cut! I’ve been doing it since you posted your tutorial. I get sooo many compliments on it!
honestly as someone with crippling social anxiety you are doing a service teaching people haircuts. one of the hardest things for me is sitting in front of a mirror and talking to a stranger about my life,  i have been cutting my own hair for a long time now
The shirt is so appropriate
😊 pop
I have thin longish hair, I tried this and it completely ruined my hair 🥲 my hair was so thin on the bottom layer, my mom had to cut my hair to even out to the top layer so that my hair wasn’t so see through thin 😭
Lol he is a good teacher
🥰🥰🥰🥰
I'm so excited to see you watching Jenna Phipps doing your butterfly cut! I have been watching her videos for a few years now and she did a stellar job!
Brad HELP! I've done my own hair for about 15 years and I cut about 10 inches of hair off a year ago. It's now between my chin and shoulders. But I've been slacking on giving myself an actually nice haircut. What's a good look for short hair on someone with an oval face?
I love you
Hey Brad, about the oatmylk, I go to a place called health resolutions center out in cali. Dr. Zafis is incredible and has helped me with so many of my allergies. I was allergic to salt and it was rough, but now I am fine =D I am sure theres something like that out where you are.
So as someone that's about to graduate cosmetology school, I don't mind this at all. There will always be people who want to get pampered and if you want to do it yourself I just want you to do it right. Thank you Brad Mondo for helping ❤❤❤
Grabbing a random object to measure the length is 100% what I would end up doing too 😂
Try almond milk in ur matcha, or coconut milk.
Brad is for the People!!! 💖
Re: Oat Milk Allergy-- there are SO many other kinds of milk. Try rice milk. Almond milk......SOY milk. Coconut milk! You will find one you like. And if you don't ? Benadryl. ^_^
I love this cut! Thanks @BradMondo for the tutorial.
Oh no, allergic to oat milk! What about pea milk? Its so good, try it with your matcha! btw your videos never disappoint!
Hi Brad, I was trying to figure out if,  maybe you were a bit under the weather in this video? Did you have a fever? Hope you are well 😊  On another note,  would you recommend this haircut for thick, straight hair that is a bit past the shoulders? Thanks a bunch 😊
Hi Brad, I'm so happy you're back. You were missed! I for one am sooo grateful that I'm can cut my own hair at home. TBH, I'm a bit of an introvert and having to sit and chat for and hour or so with my stylist sometimes is tiresome and draining. I have a great stylist but am glad to be able to save money too. She was kind enough to allow me to get color kits during the pandemic but had to stop early this year so I'm coloring my hair at home with eSalon. I'm enjoying the color and the freedom to color my own hair too!
I have to say, everyone should know their limitations. Watching a YouTube tutorial does into make you a hair professional.
Why is it called butterfly?
as a barista, i'd say to substitute the oat milk with soy if you can have that.
Came here for the Jenna Phipps haircut, LOVE her and her crochet videos sooo much! ❤
I love u Brad
Keep doing you! What you are bringing to the world is more than enough! You do so much good for the world! Just know we all love you!!!
Coconut milk n matcha is swell 👌👌 lil alternative
Thank you so much for helping us! Not all of us can go to a salon for one reason or another. I did the butterfly cut and loved it! I freeze framed your video so I did it exactly lol I’m actually going to take off a little more next time I think. I’ll get more and more brave. And even maybe add some curtain bangs 😁 very happy thanks to you Brad 💗 You make us feel Brave!
Fabulous.... Glad to see you again!!!!
i want a cut tutorial for shorter hair, like jaw length.
Brad, are you gluten sensitive?  That could be why you are having a reaction .
Who else noticed he called Jenna Phipps, Jenna PHILLIPS with so much confidence 😂😂😂
👋👋 Can someone tell me if this haircut looks good up in a high pony?
Just did it this week and it's honestly the best haircut i've ever had!
I need a video from you everyday 😅love your videos!!
My hairdresser loves you!  ❤
I’m digging this Brad vibe right now.
I’ve missed you so much and I’m so glad to see you
Dude in the best way possible you are OUTTA CONTROL TODAY and I LOVE IT🤣That break did you so well, you've always been amazing but you're straight up vivacious today.  Also I am SO sorry to hear you may be allergic to oatmilk. I live off that s***. I wonder if it's an ingredient? I'm allergic to A LOT of things, and some oatmilk brands make me react and make me sick because they have sunflower or soy oil (for some f***in reason) which I'm highly allergic to. My sister really likes coconut milk, so perhaps that could work for you? Also maybe hemp milk or flaxseed milk? Either way good luck (;w; )
Lol I followed brads butterfly cut tutorial and I love it!! I did have help though bc my hair is super super thick 😂
Can you please do a video where you try and do box brids because I saw the one where you reacted to it
I just followed your tutorial on my sisters hair, she looks SO CUTE
I love how he has a butterfly hoodie on for the butterfly cut video😅❤️
You just need to find an alternative that's not oat milk I know avoiding the things that hurt us is hard but you can do it brad we all believe in you 😂
Unsweetened coconut milk for lattes is divine! I love the one from Silk. Obsessed hehe
Brad woke up on this day and chose violence hahaha YES Brad!!!! I LOVE THIS FOR YOU! Goooo brad go brad go brad go brad, we got ya, we got ya dude. 😂❤
Nothing you can't eat all oats
Brad, whatever it is that you done with your face: make up, sun, facials, I want to know   The skin is GLOWING
try almond milk, bb
Oat milk has high gluten content, could you be gluten intolerant?
Try cashewmilk Brad! :)
Brad please do a 2000s egirl hairstyle tutorial <3 (totally not asking for myself)😂😂😂
Yeeesss! We love Jenna!
He said 6 inches and 2 hairs.....😂😂😂😂😂😂
I am SOOOOO here for the IDGAF energy Brad got after his YouTube break! ❤
7:00 I’m a Starbucks barista and we’ve noticed that a lot of people have issues with oat milk, sadly. It’s my preferred milk but it makes my stomach so upset. I have no problem with oats though. I wonder if there’s some underlying reason to all of it. In the meantime, I recommend a soy milk matcha! Not as good, but about as close as you can get.
I honestly cut and dye my own hair because I cannot afford to go to a good stylist and tip them the way I think they deserve but I still want vivid hair. Trust me, of I had the extra money I would much rather pay someone else to do it. It's a lot of work lol 😂  Also, Thank you Brad for helping us be able to make our selves look and feel beautiful at home even if we cant afford to go the the salon. You and Aka Aislin are my got tos❤🥰
As a hairstylist I thank you ! You have no idea how many people have come to my salon because they botched their hair with your tutorial and me having to fix it, so actually thank you 😂😂😂❤❤❤
You inspired me to try fun colors in my hair, and even try new hair styles for fun. I ended up shaving my head completely and LOVING it. Lol   Haters gonna hate, but we ❤️❤️❤️ you.
Brad you deserve a round of applause 👏🏻 for introducing us all to the butterfly cut .  It’s perfect for everyone and your right layers are amazing ❤
Try blueberry and earl gray it’s amazing!!
They all looked so good!!
I’m a hairstylist and if people can’t afford or don’t want to go to a Salon I have no problem with that you should educate people how to do their hair. it scares me and I can usually see it on the streets but whatever if people are happy they’re happy and not everyone can afford the really expensive prices. Now frankly, I’m sick of it but doing my own hair and it’s just really hard😂 that’s why I hats off to these girls that have zero knowledge and they’re still doing their hair and half the time it comes out pretty good so seriously wherever the heat 😊is coming from the hairstylists. Ignore that they’re mad that they can’t work three days and make thousands of dollars people don’t even realize and yes it is hard on your body and things cost money products but by no means, are you stealing money out of the pockets of stylists people that do their hair at home we’re always gonna do their hair at home they just maybe would’ve done it as well without your help❤
As a single Mom with two growing boys. My experience has been a salon trip is not a financial luxury I can always afford for myself personally. I am very grateful for your content and help, so even though I don't have a million bucks, I can kinda feel like it. You give so many of us confidence to believe in ourselves and that's a wonderful gift 😅 You're amazing and I never miss an upload! You were so missed but I'm so glad you got some R&R.
This video made me want to try as well. I have hair up to my *ss and my bangs are nonexistent, litteraly same lenght as the rest of my hair. I'm dying to get something to contour my face. I'd probably be cutting a whole feet of my hair if I do that.
Ok, real talk. I have watched Brad for years. (My Sundays are brightened by it.) I needed to be reminded which cut was “The Butterfly” as well.   I am making a hair appointment now while I am being reminded. (Ty!) I like doing my own color. I could cut it like I have in the past, but professionally done & styled hair is a lovely experience that I like to treat myself to for different events.
Brad, I know you're vegan and that's why you don't drink milk, but, I'm lactose intolerant so I can't consume a lot of dairy products and I always drink soy or almond milk. I just looked it up and both soy milk and almond milk are vegan. personally, I can't really handle the taste of oat and coconut milk, but coconut milk is good if you like the taste of oat milk. (I recommend the brand Silk)
you need to try almond milk matcha!!!!
Love that you watched Jenna’s! When she filmed it I had hoped you would lol
i feel so bad for the second girl... her hair is in such bad shape aha.. she really needs to take better care of her hair, like really bad... she needs some olaplex 3 in her hair and some super EXTREMELY strong heat protectant, and to really prioritize styling her hair as infrequently as possible... she really needs to only style her hair like once a week, otherwise she is gonna end up with no hair, and be unable to style it at all eventually :(
This is making me wanna cut my hair RNNN
Can someone explain what is the difference between the butterfly cut and the shag
I'm dead.. It's about 6 inches & 2 hairs 😂
Thanks much brad seriously for just a cut $40-50 starting
Strands on my hands!
I'm so happy you're back! I love you bunches!
I wanna do this but I’m too scared lol
I'm so glad your back I love your videos would love to have you do my hair. I've butchered it through the years
Who else is doin a butterfly cut tonight?
YOUR butterfly cut???  With all due respect, Brad my dear, we were doing this back in the 70's when we all wanted to look like David Cassidy and Farrah Fawcett 🤣
I cut my hair just now bc of this video lol. I think I like it 😊
I did the butterfly cut on myself about two weeks ago and now I'm sporting the shortest bangs I've ever had.  Still not sure how I feel about it. I wanted to make sure I cut "enough" off.
You might like soy milk or almond milk instead of oat milk. I recommend the almond, or at least get the soy as organic and low sugar.
PMG YOU WATCHED JENNA
When you go into your random made up songs and weirdness I just love it, LOL!  Because so relatable for me!  "The life is coming to life.  The vision is coming to life, to life, life" 😂
Love you and all your tips. I now can do the butterfly cut with out fing it up
I agree w/ the first girl - cuts are so much easier than curling !
is there a difference between a wolf cut, unicorn cut, and a butterfly cut?
You tell em brad! We love you for helping us! I did a butterfly cut thanks to you and I loved it after!
Phenomenal teacher🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
the levels to which you make tiktok hair dressers FROTH AT THE MOUTH with how much they hate you is nowhere near deserved. I had to unfollow that one dude because his vitriol towards you was getting extremely personal and frankly unfounded. he is literally obsessed with you lol  not gonna act like I didn't participate. but there's being critical, and then there's being almost violently aggressive lol it isn't within me to hate someone on the internet that violently    glad youre back Brad 💜
okay but fr, Nicol Concilio is one of my fav YouTubers
We love you and thank you for the hair cutting tutorials!  There was a very simple one you did in the pandemic that I have used multiple times! Super easy and comes out nice!
Rice milk
You can substitute milk for oat milk or vice versa by using the same amount the recipe calls for. Regular cow’s milk is what is used in most recipes with the plant-based milks being the subs. So, yes, you can use milk in place of oat milk in cooking.
For some reason, every time when I watch your videos then look at the results that others get I gets so jealous! It’s because of how my hair is is either kinky curly or just wavy (ps not in a good way) , plus a bunch of frizz. To be honest every product I tried, it feels like my hair just doesn’t like me. But I still love your videos! And also thank you for helping me understand understand a little more about my hair! So again thank you :)
pls react to mia maples cutting her haiirrrrrr🙏
I did this cut but I didn't record it. And it came out so good ❤ love my new cut especially when I do like deep wave curls omg the layers are perfectly short in the front and then long in the back 😊🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I did this cut on my curly hair. I don’t care about my hair at all. Like very much of the mindset “it will grow back of its awful” so I just did a major chop and it looked awesome
So glad you’re back! Also did this to my hair and so happy I did. You’re the best 😊
I gave myself the wolf cut following your instructions and my hair looks sooo good. I have curly hair so it really helped my curls fall nicely around my face.
I love you BM .... lol i didnt wanna type ur name out 😂😬
I really hate people touching me, so I'm really bad about going to the hairdresser, doctor, dentist, optometrist etc. Thanks to Brad, at least my hair can look decent even though I cut it at home.❤
Actually i tried your tips to cut layers and it was PERFECT
I have tried your butterfly cut... i had long fine hair.. i never had any haircut other than straight trimming from bottom.. i wanted a different haircut without losing too much length.. every hair salon kept saying no hairstyle would suit you since u have such thin hair.. then one night impulsively at 3 am i tried butterfly hair cut.. and my hair looked so good and voluminous and not too short.. just like how i wanted... i am sure it wasn't flawless.. a bit choppy and uneven at places.. but my hairs are wavy so it's not very obvious and it looks so much better than flat lying hair... Thank you so much for your tutorial 😊
I literally used this tutorial yesterday to trim my ends. It’s easy and it works! Thanks Brad 👍🏻❤️
Haha sitting here watching where I went wrong😂
Love U and everything about U🤘🤘💙
Oh Brad.... don't mince any words towards the hairdressers....  You never leave with lack of entertainment.
I follow your butterfly cut video every time I cut my hair. It’s very straightforward and difficult to mess up lol
How about rice milk?
I just did it last week!! Didn't film it, but it's WONDERFUL. THANK YOU. 💕 Jenna is totally what brought me here, btw!!
LMAOOOOO so you saw the beauty guru chatter? i came across one thread when i was trying to figure out where you disappeared to and i was NOT PREPARED for how mad they were at you! honestly *thank god for brad mondo* and his home haircut tutorials because some of us bitches be BROKE AF and folks act like if we don't pay $50 for a haircut and $30 for salon shampoo then we will GO BALD like 🙄 so thank you, again, for doing what you do and helping us save some coin and still look fantastic 👍
I have long curly hair and NEED some kind of haircut to bring my hair to life again but I’m not prepared to spend another $100-$220 to get it cut by someone who knows Diva Curl hair cutting. So I think I’ll just try it and if I hate it then I’ll go to a hairdresser
So... I watched this vid and then immediately lopped off 7 inches and it's so fluffing cute!! Like I'm so impressed. Even my bangs are cute and I didn't even want them, but they're here now and they have permission to stay! Thankyouthankyouthankyou! ❤
The people who were going to go to a salon anyway are more likely than not ending up there from not being hungry enough to be perfect with the cut 😂  Lots of love Brad! So glad you're here doing what you do ❤  (I did hair professionally for a hot minute. I also have been way too broke for any hairdresser plenty of times. The only time I ever messed my hair up was when I could afford it lol but ofc this is to be playful! Everyone has reasons and motivation and, having grown up pre-youtube - people will 100% cut their own hair with, or without a tutorial)
First girl was a 10/10!  Edit: just finished the video and they all killed it!
They turned out so good!
❤ to all 😘
Coconut milk saved my life ❤ so gut friendly
Brad because of the oatmilk allergy: I'm allergic to several foods, please go to a doctor and do a blood test that measures the levels of different IgE antibodies (a way to find out about your allergies and how severe they are). In my experience the allergic reaction can vary depending on many factors, so please be careful. It could may also be an intolerance to oats. We love you sm, thanks for this great video ! So happy you're back ❤️👑
1:16 got me cacklinggggggg 🤣🤣💕💕
I cut my own hair as I can't stand having my haircut by hairdressers due to sensory issues.
I literally love you and you’re videos !!
I love you Brad! 😍
I was able to do my wolf cut correctly after you and I wear my curls more now Tysm!!❤
Would this still work if I always wear my hair in a side part?
Get tested for Celiac Disease ;) - but also, almond milk is a solid option ❤
I'm allergic to oats and oatmeal. I'd imagine I'm allergic to oatmilk as well. Lmao so I've never tried it. 😂
Almond milk is just as good! Maybe try that. ❤️ I missed you and I’m glad you’re back.
There has been so much going on in my life, most of it not good, so I don't have the money to get my haircut.  I used to cut my hair and it came out meh, but after watching Brad's videos, it comes out great, with very little hassle.  I couldn't have done it without you Brad!❤️
As a hairdresser, I actually appreciate your tutorials because I have the opportunity to fix people's hair when they mess up! 😂
👏🏻👍🏻❤️
I WAS WAITING FOR QUEEN BRAD TO ADDRESS THE DRAMA WITH OTHER HAIR DRESSERS!!! Bless
I’m so glad that you addressed the angry hairdressers because I went to Sally’s recently and almost gave the employee anxiety when I dropped the phrase, butterfly cut before she referred me to $60 hair cutting scissors😣🦋
tbh brad’s reaction videos only make me visit my hairdresser more often
Why do I love it when Brad hacks a lung? 😮🤢😮🤢😂😂😂 2:37
Yaasss
I love #jennaphipps she's hilarious
Did it.. Love it. Grew up in the 80s /90s love layers - my favourite cut was always done with just a razor - no scissors (one of my friends used to do it) the lack of precision in the layers works best for me. You inspired me. Love from Newfoundland 🍁 (my hairdryer died so I couldn't style it, so no video)
Brad I hope u do another video reacting/discussing K-pop hairstyles
Oat milk isn't good for you at all. try almond milk or something
To the girl in the black top with the severely damaged bleached hair, please get a wide-toothed comb when combing out curls... Your hair is already so damaged raking that brush through it you're damaging it more
Farrah fawcett baby!!!!
Can you do this on 4C hair?
10:56 not the Cher read😭
I'm so glad I watched this to reassure myself of cutting my own hair ❤😂 thanks Brad mondo
I did the butterfly cut with great success..  love it.  Thank you Brad!
I just gave myself a butterfly cut this morning! The hardest part was parting my hair evenly by myself. Thank you for the tutorial! It’s super cute on my curly hair.
Try soy milk they have vanilla flavor it’s hella bomb
On the other hand brad makes people ruin thier hair and then we get to get to fix thier hair for them. Its job security
I did the butterfly cut on myself with your tutorial, but I’m not entirely sure if it looks good or not. My hair was so long that the back was so much longer than the from and it looked like a shelf front vs back. So then I decided to try giving myself layers, cut the first piece and  got scared, then had a manic episode and just cut until I thought it looked good 😂
React to Mia maples!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I cannot imagine being allergic to oat milk 💔
I have strawberry blonde hair but all of my friends insist that it is ginger so could you please make a video on the different types of redheads and what natural strawberry blonde hair looks like. Also I love your videos and am so glad that your back💛💛
Sometimes it's an emotional thing and to cut your own hair and I've done it enough that I get compliments on the product of me feeling some serious emotions
6:19 she starting to liveee
When worlds collide! I love Jenna! She does cool handmade fashion.
I'm absolutely obsessed with the butterfly cut. My daughter, who doesn't usually cut her own hair, has started following your tutorial as well and her hair looks amazing. Thanks Brad.
"If anyone knows what to do about oat milk allergy" ....... switch to almond milk?? Lmao
So glad u r back at YouTube, watching your videos automatically lifts my spirit! Love u❤️
I just wanted to let you know that I missed you quite a bit when you were gone. I'm so glad you're back. I hope you got a break and the rest that you needed. Also just for your information I have been receiving a goodly number of your commercials lately. I think that you're doing a better job at getting your face out there.
omg its Jenna!
Not me about to go cut my hair now.
Brad is a ‘hard jewelry’ kind of guy
1:37 it made sense 😭
Why don’t you just have your matcha with coconut or almond? That’s what I do, it’s delish 👌🤗💕
I did it on myself and I think it looks pretty good. Maybe I'll never go to a salon again hehe
Brad your so beautiful we love u
Brad, PLEASE give me a mommy makeover. My hair is mostly natural color and it’s down to my butt! You can do anything you want!
Hi Brad. A center part doesn't flatter me. How would I cut layers into my hair with a side part? Or would this butterfly cut also work for a side part?
My hair is kind of curly but not curly at all at the same time. The butterfly cut is perfect for me as it makes the front curl and give my weird hair state a use by giving more volume
I'm glad to see you again, Brad :)
You should react to jellyfish cuts!
I was going to cut my hair but then I stopped in my tracks and said  " If im not Brad Mondo theres no chance i can do this." So I ended up not cutting my hair and im happy i didnt 😂
Wow.....she looks great..... I've got the same hair that she has( the first girl) , but MUCH LONGER....!!!! I'D LOVE TO TRY THIS, BUT I'M WAY TOO CHICKEN....!!!!
Okay wait, I was told since I have really fine hair that I should avoid layers and instead only do blunt cuts so my hair appears thicker. But if Brad says I can go back to layers, I'ma do it!
Brad!!!!!! You are SO STRANGE....!!!! I LOVE YOU.....!!!!!
I need a make over !!
I did this haircut and messed it up bigtime.   My fault went the next day to a hairdresser  and got it fixed.
I have really long hair (over two feet) and the ends are super dead and split, but I don't want to just cut my hair and have it all straight. I am definitely going to try this on my hair. I always want to do my hair and leave little strands in the front, but my hair's just too long and it looks goofy, but with this, I can do that or just have my hair down and it would look soooooo good. If I do it myself I'll def post on my channel. Thank you for this!!
Okay so I went to a hairdresser to get a butterfly cut expecting a big change and this lady was so nice but like there  is no difference 😭 there probably would have been more of a difference if I did this at home
And if people aren’t able to follow your instructions correctly they may well end up going to a hairdresser to get it fixed anyway! It’s good for the economy 😂
Brad, before I watch this video, I NEED the deets on this hoodie
I just did this cut and I absolutely love it!!! Thank you Brad for teaching us how to do cut our hair. It’s so kind of you to help us look better and feel better about ourselves 💖
My son is allergic to oats. It's a rough allergy to have.
I have locs, I would really appreciate a demonstration with my type of hair. I'm planning to change my style with new color, piercings and haircut all together. A complete makeover. 🇭🇹
I have locs, I would really appreciate a demonstration with my type of hair. I'm planning to change my style with new color, piercings and haircut all together. A complete makeover. 🇭🇹
So to maintain the cut after a few months, do you just repeat the process?
So glad you are back Brad❤️🥰
I did a butterfly cut months ago after watching your video. I didn’t do it too dramatically but no one has ever said anything about my hair looking bad (my mom has never mentioned my hair since doing it and she’s very judgmental lololol)
I literally never go somewhere to get my hair cut, I did it once to see how they "layered" my hair, atleast what it looked like to me lol. Otherwise I always just wait til my hair gets long enough that I feel like chopping it to where it's only shoulder length and repeat. After chopping it off I'd randomly cut places to "layer". Never looked terrible, my mom even thought I got it done by someone, but I am sure it never looked amazing especially to trained eyes.  Now! Awhile back when you released the butterfly cut tutorial, I was like omg, that looks so easy and I can do it myself. So I tried it and it did turn out pretty good, ty Brad! It's amazing because I usually chop a huge chunk when I cut my hair anyways!
Took a break and gave yourself more stuff to react to, and its you! It's like full circle moment!
Some of them also have you to thank when people fail at following the tutorial lol
Here is the confession, i just used ur tutorial and cut then did the same mistake of cutting it again and again but in the end it was looking fabulous 🤩. So thank u brad for always helping me and making us confident to cut our hairs.
4:37 "isn't that nice?"
Does anyone know if shags and layers look good on straight hair?  My hair is super straight  naturally, I'm worried it will look terrible with layers
I love watching Jenna's videos they are very funny
Hairstylists could look at it as probably 7 out of 10 who cut their own hair because Brad told us to at home has to go get it fixed 🤷‍♀️ 😂
i followed your tutorial, and i love it. it changes my face, and my attitude thanks brad!
Homosexuality IS evill God was not a full to creat man and woman repent
I bleached my hair and dyed it purple following advice from your videos and it went amazing!  I love how it came out and so do all my friends and coworkers. My mom is warming up to it lol. I’m very grateful for your instructions
Have you tried almond milk?  I’m diabetic and love me some matcha latte with almond milk. Unsweetened and I add Splenda. So good!!!!!
Me waiting for the scary part-
I always look at those hair styles and wonder how they look on an undercut look? like, with half the hair being shaved, what would happen if one were to do that to whatever hair is left on top?
These girls didn’t come to PLAY!!!!
13:13 does anyone know what product she’s using to do her curls?
I love when YouTubers I follow watch each others videos I love brad and I love Jenna Phipps
Don’t EVER drink oat/almond “milk”. You are better off drink real dairy milk or coconut milk.
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Why do I watch these obsessively lol. They give me anxiety but I gotta watch 😂😂
What did you have for your lunch today Brad!!😆😆
I love your videos
I’ve cut my own hair for 15+ years. Nothing extra, just a few layers. Your butterfly cut is exactly the look I want …but 20 less minutes of extra time to achieve the same result. Thanks a bunch!
i'm pretty sure i'm also allergic to oat milk, so i have soy milk when i need to. much better. but my mum is allergic to soy, so i'm glad i didn't inherit that
Love ur hair
Brad you look extra lovely today, hair en pointe,  your skins really glowing (or the table reflection maybe helping,) but your eyes are poppin my friend.
Jesus Christ🔥🔥
i just did a butterfly cut yesterday :)
What if u Dont Part the hair in the middle? I wear sidebangs....
I've been using Brad's tutorials to cut my own hair since 2019 and the butterfly cut has done wonders for my hair
Oat milk f’s me up! The bloating is real. Almond milk treats me better.
I did this to my wavy hair twice. Each time turns out perfect. I love the effect it has on my waves. So thankful for the tutorial.  ❤
Just use almond milk or soy instead !
Who else is here just to see him reacting to @JennaPhipps ? 😂😂😂
What you should do regarding your allergy depends on how allergic you actually are. For an example, I am deathly allergic to eggs and I avoid them at all costs. I am 4/10 allergic to cat hair so I just use some over the counter medicine so I don't sneeze and itch (I own two cats) and I am maybe 2/10 allergic to strawberies but I eat them and just ignore the mild itch.
Jenna Phipps is awesome! So glad you reviewed her.
I did this cut BUT I have a side part. I mostly saved it. But this is a center part only haircut :) it's grown out nicely though! And I usually wear it all swept to one side. It was a fun and scary experience (I have hair down to my butt and I took off 10 inches!) I approve!
Brad to swap his background colour to anything other than white to stop flashbanging my eyeballs 2023  (I suggest pink on the walls and white on the table.)   Missed you!! <3 So glad you're back.
I told my friend about this.. she asked ‘does thar work?!’ ‘Sometimes 😅’ 😂
Lol I am allergic to oat milk. The reaction people that are lactose intolerant get from milk is what oat milk gives me and I just have to stay away from it. It also makes my shin and mouth itchy after I drink it so there's that. Maybe try a Benadryl beforehand or lactose pills depending on what the reaction is or stay away from it. Almond/soy or cashew milk may be better if you don't have a soy/nut allergy. I prefer my matcha with almond milk and its pretty good.
You're also getting hate for those of us (Intersex (me), Non-binary (like 70 percent of my friends) and gender rebellious (the other 30% of my friends) )folx not having to navigate an incredibly gendered space with some insecure straight that's gonna purposefully mess up our hair to make us more of whatever they think we should be rather than doing what we f🤬ing asked for. My last trip to a salon that involved scissors the b🤬 tried to make me look as cis women as possible and I have not been to a salon since (8+ years) and am probably never going back. I'd rather have bad hair than f with that colonizer dog💩.    You're providing an important service to the alphabet mafia and the autistic community, SIR! *salutes with gusto*
I thought that was Jenna in the thumbnail!!! Love her ❤❤❤
The first girl is living my hair life (fine hair, no idea what I am doing with it, etc), but anytime I have tried layers like that I just look like I have a mullet.   I also think it's weird hairdressers get so angry about your videos, I feel like if anyone doing your tutorials doesn't know it could go horribly wrong, then that is their stupidity   Lastly, I think you should do some videos for people with a mix of grey, dark and bleached hair. I am scared to use your semi-permanent color on my hair so I would rather see other people fail at it first.
brad you literally look so fine like can you stop pls??? i came for hair videos not for you to look fine as fuck and have me fanning myself
💜👑
Yesssssss!   I support this bird flipping.   They can get glad, in the same pants they got mad in.
Finished watching this and immediately started cutting 😂 It turned out AMAZING
It always makes me mad seeing the people giving you a hard time. A lot of people can’t afford the cost to get it done and they deserve to feel confident too and so if someone’s willing to give free advice to people I think it’s a good thing
So glad I'm not the only one who's allergic to oat milk. I started having terrible nausea and vomiting and finally figured out it was the oat milk, any brand.
There's a guy on tiktok that has based his entire personality on hating on Brad. He comes off as super jealous and trying to latch onto any bit of hate clout he can.
People really do act like you're telling people do to something awful and get so hateful about it. It's absurd. Worst case scenario someone fries their hair off or give themselves a bad haircut. It's not like you're giving tips and tricks on diy lip fillers or something actually dangerous. And if they're threatened by people learning how to their own hair, that says more about their skill level than anything.   I would love to get my hair professionally done and I know the results would be better, but I am happy I'm able to do a pretty decent job myself rather not have my hair done at all. I got a lot of compliments on my hair after using your videos to learn how to bleach and colour it
Jenna!!! Yesssssss!!!
Brad you are amazing, I wish you were around when I was 15. I have a 13 year old son who is having some social anxiety going on right now, the hair is getting long.  It's a very grown-out shaved sides/long top cut. I'd love if you could somehow make a video for boy/shorter cuts.  Even just the skater-boy flipped-out hair would be cool. I just want to be able to help him out without him having to go to a hairdresser
me right now with scissors in my hands:
New brad mondo video on my birthday.. happy birthday to meeeee!! 😍
I'm sorry to hear abour the anger directed your way 🧡 I'm disbled and can't work, spending money at a hairdresser is a no go. I dye my own hair (with henna), and have been cutting it mysef for the last 8 years or so. Also started cutting my spouse's hair now that he has it long. The butterfly cut is amazing for my thin and fine hair! Thank you!
What is that tool to curl hair the second girl is using? Her curls look so great
I did this cut on myself... I have really long thick hair and chopped a massive amount of hair off then I added "side bangs". As someone who hasn't had layers since 2009 I LOVE IT. My hair is still technically as long as it was but I have half the weight of hair, it feels amazing.
Did anyone else notice how pretty his eyes look in this video? Or how glowy his skin is lookin? I was getting distracted by it haha
I had an emotional moment last month. I had long curly hair past my Butt. I decided to do the chop and cut off 16+ inches... by myself lol
I've had the same hairstyle for so long it's gone out of style, came back into style, came back with a new name. I have incredibly high layers. They typically start above my ear. If I can put my hair in a ponytail without my shortest layers falling out, they're too long. When I started getting my hair done I told them it was similar to a mullet and they understood just fine. My bangs are grown out and angle cut to frame my face. Throughout the years it's been called slithering, feathering, and now curtain bangs.   The good news is that since high layers are in again I don't have to take my life in my hands when I get my hair done! One time the girl twirled my hair and cut it because she saw it on TikTok. Now I have to convince people to do it in a way that doesn't kill my length, but they are least know HOW to do high layers.
I think he's talking about hair Buddha 😆🤣😂😹
i want a butterfly cut and curtain bangs but im too scared to do them myself so im going to a hairdresser 🥲
It’s about 6 inches and two hairs 🤣
Can we just all agree that whenever Brad posts he makes us happy?!! ❤
Let's face it, with the amount of absolute fails you've posted over the years. A lot of them are going to get it fixed at a hairdresser. They probably make more fixing a disaster than they do doing a normal cut and style. The ones that can do a good job at home were never going to a hairdresser in the first place. I don't think you're doing any damage to other hairdressers profits. Love you. ❤
2:34 I can't stop laughing I'm sorry 😂
They should applaud you, when we mess up that's who we have to go to anyway (hair stylists) 😂 If I hadn't tried to give myself bangs, I would never have met my awesome hair stylist Val!
I’m more stressed about my hair being parted properly when I braid it than the first girl was while cutting it 😂
I love Jenna! Thank you for reacting to her video!
You're the best. Thank you. I went to salons my whole life then went through a divorce and stage 4 cancer at the same time.  I could never work again and can't afford to go to a salon. In Canada there is no alimony. So even though I was the faithful one now I suffer. I do my best and your tutorials help. So screw hairdressers that can't understand and count themselves lucky that their lives are good
I wanna do it but i have frizzy, dry and wavy but somewhat curly at the end? Bruh i dont even know
who else saw jenna phipps and clicked (edit:) jenna PHILLIPS????? bruh
😍❤️😍❤️😍❤️😍❤️😍😍❤️❤️
This pink desk is making your face glow red, looks like you have a sunburn 😢
Missed this energy! 🤗❤️
I kinda want to get layers and all too but I'm scared I'm gonna end up looking like a girl with a haircut from the 70s☹️
I got a butterfly cur and the hair dresser made it look so bad so I chopped it of in a new hair style and I am in love with it
Love you Brad. But do you have a black eye coming on the left side. Looks red in the video compared to the other side. Hope your OK xx
I am the same as the first lady. I don't know how to use a curling iron, I don't think I even own a blow dryer... but I have been contemplating doing this cut. Due to migraines and depression I haven't been to a salon in way too long, but my hair is so long and probably not helping my migraines so I could stand to lose a good 6 to 8 inches and still have some length. So my question is, does this look good still if you don't do any styling after? 🤔
6 inches and 2 hairs 💀😂
I didn’t even watch your video when I did it or record myself but I did watch your butterfly video a WHILE ago and did my hair just the other day and it looks great😊
He's bacccck we've missed youuuu❤❤❤
I do not have the guts to do this. I'm arthritic, my hands and arms hurt and shake if I'm holding them up for too long, I imagine going in to cut and shearing it off in an angle and then just hating my life.
This haircut is so easy and works perfectly. I have curly hair, so to account for shrinkage, I had my mom cut the length to where I wanted it while it was down and then used that as my guideline to cut when it was in the ponytails. That made sure I didn't go too short but I still got all the layers I was looking for. I absolutely love this cut on my hair!
Fuck the haaatteeerrrrs Brad has been the best teacher I never asked for
I missed Brad so much
Try sugar free oatmilk. It could be the process. Or try pea milk
Watch the ManesbyMel video about how the butterfly cut isn't the best alternative to SOME types of hair!!! She demonstrates how with her own hair.  (no need to be so aggressive everytime people call you out, Brad)
you are actually helping the hairdressers LOL, these people usually fail and need to get a professional to fix it!!
How does it look air-dried???
I missed u soo much! Their is literally no other hairdresser half as funny as u brad. I binge watched ur bleach fails and that made me laugh so hard xD
I did the butterfly cut and it came out so amazing. I’m have to do round 2 soon for my grow out!
Do a video about curly hair, please!!!
Isn’t that unwise - the 4th sentence to the rhyme
Try soymilk, if u cant have soy cashewmilk is pretty good, or macadamia milk. Almond was too bland for me.
Would this be the equivalent of a V cut? Where’s it’s shorter in the sides and longer in the middle, therefore giving you layers more so in the side?? Does anyone know?? 😊
coconut milk matcha.. I swear by this !!
All those angry hairdressers are not Brad Mondo. The reason I started cutting my own hair was too many bad cuts. I might as well give myself an amateur cut as to pay someone to do it.
I fixed my own hair using your videos. It came out nice but seems a little dull. It used to sparkle…what should I do to add some shine ?
Brad I'm also a hairstylist and I have many food allergies! You mentioned being sensitive to oat milk. Are you also sensitive to gluten? If so, is your oat milk gluten free? If it's not try that and see if it helps! If not there's other types of vegan milks out there. I personally use Elmhurst which is from your home state- New York! They have great, clean options for plant milk!
HOWWWWWWW🤩🤩
Homeboy with the long hair that talks shit about you needs to get a life and hop off your 🍆
Not the internet making me think cutting my own hair is a good idea. I'm incredibly tempted
Shout out to the creative, crazy, free-spirit Jenna Phipps!
Im a non-angry hairdresser that loves your videos 😁
I Love ❤️ You Brad, You are a Genius, a Hair Guru, Etc... Bless You.
I have my hair on mostly on 1 length, because usually when I put layers in there's just not a lot on the bottom layer 😅 I tried it so many times everytime regretting it haha
Brad you are hilarious 😂🥰🔥🙏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🇬🇧xxxx

What happened to hairdressers supporting eachother? I’m a hairstylist and absolutely love watching your videos!!
I started cutting my own hair when I was 15, and haven’t cut my hair at a hairdresser since, and I’m 27 now! I’ve done the butterfly cut for 7-8 years now and I always get a result I’m happy with.   But, I will say: I always do it with dry hair. My hair is thick and gets really REALLY curly when wet, but dries pin straight (and if I do the curly hair routine, I get a lions mane without a single curl but with all the volume). I did it with wet hair ONCE and it was SO uneven, I probably took off 10 inches of hair when I wanted to take off ~5 inches.
Damn it, I didn't make the cut, (pun intended,) and my tiktoks were made in SUCH proximity to this video being created too! 😅 next time, I'll have to do something more drastic to get your attention. (Kidding, this process was terrifying enough as is 😬)  Still, as usual, this video was a lot of fun to watch! And thank you for teaching me how to cut my hair into a style I've been dying to try at a time when I wasn't able to go to a professional ❤ love you, Brad!
Gosh you have no idea how happy I am you're back gorgeous!!! ❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤
... Now I need a DIY to cut curly hair into something short and off the neck. XD I just wanna switch up my style but a lot of hair dressers in my area can't seem to cut my curly hair right. D: And the one that did AMAZING... closed down during covid. D:
I cannot afford to go to a pro.... have cut and colored my hair since I was 14. Am 52 now. Have had some bad results, but mostly good
This is going to be my next haircut!!! In two months I'm going to try it. I'm sooooo tired of hairdressers. Paying lots of money for a nice haircut. The first time, wow so good, impressed. When I go to retouch the style, they mess the original cut that I used to love. I'm tired of paying for inconsistent haircuts. I rather save money and DIY. Thanks Brad for teaching us some easy techniques!
watching your videos when i’m down makes me feel something
The rest of your rhyme... isn't that unwise?
bro i’m driving to work and the siren sound scared me so hatd
Instead of oatmilk try macadamia milk, it has the same thickness. I get it oatmilk is the best 😭 tbh go get tested and see if you're allergic to oatmilk because it's worth it. And whoever is bleaching the second girls hair is banding like a mutha f-er. Y'all don't blend the bleach with already bleached hair 🥹
F those other hairdressers. They are jealous.
Don’t give a crap about the haters 😊  you are helping so many people who might be to ill to go to a hairdresser, or they don’t have the money 😢 You are doing a terrific job at helping them look and feel better ❤❤❤ I  L❤VE what you do ❣️
I am annoyed by all the mondo haters, especially on TikTok. It's mainly just jealousy which is so ugly and unnecessary
Try coconut milk matcha, it's so good!  Btw, you're looking tanned and beautiful!
I’m so glad your back😭💜
you should do a video where we send you photos of our hair and what hairstyle would work best for our face shape and hair type. (more so speaking that i need help lol)
🦋🦋💇‍♀️💇‍♂️💇💇🏾‍♀️💇🏿‍♀️💇🏾🥰🌈have a good day and night positive vibes
I don't know what they're mad about, SOOOOOOO MANY PEOPLE do NOT listen to your advice and still end up going to a salon to fix the damage they do from not listening to you. We've all seen it. So maybe what they're really mad about is that they're having to really dig deep & improve their own skill set to be able to salvage the destruction people do to themselves instead of making it worse or having to turn away those people because they aren't capable of doing anything decent with what's left. That's why they're mad, Brad.
Seeing this video just makes me wanna do a bufferfly haircut :D
Life feels like normal again when you’re here, Brad. I’ve been a bit down in the dumps for a while now, but you never fail to make me smile. ❤
Well done! 🌸V
By the way, I love the glow that your skin gets from the pink desk under you! You look radiant without it too though 😆 just something I noticed!
This is the 420th comment 💚
The butterfly sweatshirt that matches the theme🥳🥳🥳
So glad you decided to come back❤ missed you!! 💕💕💕
Cute nose job 👌🏽
Loving the new editing style!
"Im taking a break from mocha coz i think im allergic to oat milk....THATS A FVKEN LIE I HAD TWO TODAY!" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 so relatable!
I did this cut on my own hair and my 13 year old daughters, she has thick dead straight hair and mines curly/wavy and both cuts came out so well.  Mine was a few months ago so I think I'm gonna do mine again right now!!! Thanks Brad for helping those of us who can't afford hairdressers right now!!!!❤❤❤
Oat milk is legit the only milk I can have.
I hadn't been to a hairdresser in 3 years, and was just sick of the state of my hair. 😅 So I tried the Butterfly Cut, and it turned out amaaaaazing 🤩 And it is so easy too. 😃 Thank you for all that you do, Brad.
Try gluten free oat milk !
BRAD, bad words,, its the crown dangit
I fucked up my butterfly cut badly back in November but it's grown own lovely,finally
Going to the salon today to chop off all my hair:) my hair is passed my butt kinda scared but I will not go through another summer with long hair I regret it each time (I believe this summer will be the hottest)
Do not feel bad not everyone can afford to pay theses prices to go to a hair dresser!
K I’m gonna go for it 😅Wish me 🍀
Once when I told the salon I wanted layers she told me it will thin my hair out too much since I already have fine hair 😟
I did your tutorial and it came out great. Not perfect, but I had nothing but compliments. Thank you because I don't have money to go to a good hairdresser anymore.
I could watch you react to anything for hours and hours and my day would be well spent. Don't listen to the haters, you do your best to give us accurate and easy-to-follow tutorials, if we don't listen that's not your fault, it's also not your fault when those people who didn't listen show up to these hairdressers and ask them to fix their bad cut that they chose to do to themselves. As far as you taking business away from professionals, the people who get their hair cut and colored by hairdressers do so because they know they could never do it themselves. If anything, you're adding clients to the pool who need color corrections, AND pushing hair stylists to use new techniques and set clearer boundaries around their client's expectations. You keep doing you, Brad, I love it! (And I will let no one touch my hair but my hairdresser ;))
Too much oats is not bueno so try Elmhurst walnut milk.  Even Barista Walnut milk.
Ok Brad your being extra in the video today.  To much caffeine?  Supplement your Oak milk with cashew or almond milk.  You need to see Mia Maples cutting video.  She does not go back for a seconds and third. She cuts it all in one chop.
dAmn, I missed you so much, love you Brad❤
I followed your curtain bangs tutorial and they came out awesome
1:20 in and god I just love Brad so much 😂♥️
BRAD, I AM A RETIRED MASTER STYLIST OF OVER 35 YEARS THAT BEING SAID IT IS NOT YOUR BUTTERFLY CUT !! GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE !! SUNNIE BROOK CAME UP WITH IT NOT YOU !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I had mine done in a butterfly cut. BTW I love it. We went off your tutorial on YouTube and she said I can’t guarantee the cut!  😂. It came out beautifully. She also wanted to know if I had brought my own elastics. I was like no. She came up with some.
When I saw Jenna do this cut it was so weird Because I watch you both but then to watch you react to Jenna doing your cut *chefs kiss*
Damn all of these came out so good 😀❤️
Brad Jésus IS coming repent off your sins and recieve salvation
💕💕💕💕
Beautiful people don't gatekeep...if hairdressers are gatekeeping, welp that's their problem but you have saved me a trip to a hairsalon that charges the shit out of me for layers I can now do at home for free. Thank you for helping me economize my money in this era Brad love you for thisss❤
If they want to arrest you Brad, they'll have to go through me 🥊😂
I love Jenna she's incredible. What a crossover.
Instead of oat milk you can use soja milk
Hazelnut milk is literally THE BEST MILK IN EXISTANCE. It tastes like nutella it's amazing believe me
Thankyou.
I’m 54 and did this cut a couple weeks ago. My hair was quite long and I took 6 inches off.. never cut my hair before and it came out ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!
'it's a good 6 inches and about 2 hairs' DRAG HER
Like wth omg ive been cutting my hair for years or forever and i only cut my hair no one else
People Who are doing their hair at home are not going to the salon anyways.  Even if they are failing 😂
These gals look incredible! April (the second one) especially! And Brad, dang, your reactions are FIRE 🔥🔥🔥
Can you do this cut and have a side part?
I just chopped off 7 inches of my hair last weekend
I have a question Brad. When you go to the salon and they condition your hair before you leave. What is the difference between that conditioner and store bought? And what is the best equivalent to salon conditioner that normal people can buy??
omg is that Jenna Phipps in the thumbnail??
Is Brad wearing a new Melanie Martinez hoodie??
The bird you flipped told mine to go and hit the like button 😂
This video is convincing me to do the thing 🥲
Loved the slim shady moment there 😅
I used your men's hair tutorial for my autistic son. He can't handle going to a salon. He gets overwhelmed and has sensory meltdowns. So screw the hairdressers that are mad. I'm grateful
love uuuuu
You can drink soy milk if you're not allergic to it too
It's like they always say, Brad: The higher the ponytail, the closer to God 😂 😂
Is the first girl trolling us bc she killed it. Did anyone catch a peek at those scissors that she used? Those were some good scissors! Great job sis!
I love how happy you are when it goes right - you are so beautifully positive <3
As a hairstylist, I enjoy watching your videos. Getting hair services is a luxury not just with money, but time as well. I've never guilt tripped my clients for trimming their own bangs or doing their own color. I've always complemented & if the trim is a little off then encourage that it's not too bad & can be fix. I appreciate someone on the internet educating the general population on hair care. Keep doing your thing.
I was really digging the "rap". 😆😂😀
🤗🎈🔥
They say  any plant based milks are good for matcha, so something like almond milk or soy milk might be nice??
6 inches and 2 hairs 💀
I honestly cannot afford going to a proper hairdressers more than once a year so I LOVE your tutorials for doing my own at home! I've cut, bleached and coloured all myself since the first covid lockdown with only a few horrific mistakes 👀
I go to a hair salon for a haircut every 3-5 years. I go to one in a small town and pay about $30 pre-tip. I only go when my ends are split badly and need to be trimmed. I don't ever take off a lot. I have straight, fine, thin hair and I like my hair long. I don't need much. I went to a big city salon for my trim once and paid $150 for it. For my low-maintenance preferences, it's not worth it.
The good thing about Jenna is she can always just crochet herself new hair
I wish you’d review more videos each video
I personally disagree about the layers, my hair is long and all one length apart from slightly shorter parts towards the front and I get so many compliments on my hair daily 🤷‍♀️ it's down to about my tail bone, wavy and in amazing condition 👌 it's also bright copper, I love my hair
Show us how to do a pixie at home.
Brad's got an Ember mug! I love mine 🥰
I came here for a Jenna appreciation comment. I haven’t found it yet. So this is the Jenna appreciation comment. 😬 🥰
Hi brad ur actually probably not allergic to oatmilk, it’s actually just process oatmilk bc of thickeners, I don’t know any small natural brands but there are home oat milk makers
I'm in a hair dressing class and I love it and when im doing hair I remember stuff you say and I put it into what I'm doing
I'm a haird stylist, and I 1000% f**king LOVE that you are helping people with their confidence in cutting their own hair. Before going to cosmetology school, I literally never went to a salon to cut my hair. It made my social anxiety sky rocket, and I often had panic attacks during the service. Plus, sometimes the cost was just not feasible for my family. The fact that you are doing these tutorials and making it easier for people like me who, for one reason or another, can't go to a salon, makes me cry happy tears. So thank you for everything you do, Brad, and you will ALWAYS have my support
i’m sorry wait how is this his hair design? iknow im not old but….. i’m pretty sure it’s been around before him he just slapped this name on it
Yeah I don't get the hate you get about this, because people have and will do their own hair at home anyway.. so you've given some tutorials as guidance.. some people will still mess up either way and have to go to a hairdresser after, but that's not really on you 🥴
Where did u get that hoodie?
been cutting and coloring my hair for years because salons always mess up my shit. fuck them. now i get compliments and people asking who does my color, who does my trim, who does this and that amd im just like ME, I DO. SALONS ARE A WASTE
I’m a retired hairdresser, along with my regular salon job I taught home hair cuts at the community centre..basically mothers to trim their children s hair and also take care of their own hair. We had so much fun and in no way did that take away from hair salons.
There’s one hair dresser who i specifically see all the time on tiktok addressing your vids. He has long red/brown hair and at this point I feel he’s just obsessed. 😅
I combined your butterfly tutorial and your sorta bob one, and now I have Scarlett Johansen's hair from the ghost in the shell movie - something I've wanted for years! Thank you ❤
There is a Walmart brand of a lactaid thing that you eat that feels like tums and it works wonders for me
I love coconut milk.
I'm planning on dying my hair dark blue or dark purple  since hair dresser wants 70 bucks or more to dye and cut my hair! Highlights would be more!
I did this cut after your reaction video on it (featuring the YouTuber Fatish from down under) It worked great, except I think I didn't do the back exactly right, and I'm afraid to try to match up the ends. BUT I'm so happy with the results!!!
I was surprised to see Nicole doing the butterfly cut on here!
I've cut my own hair for over 10 years and always get compliments on my cut. I'm sure I would enjoy a hairdresser's cut but I like how I cut my own tbh!
I want to do this so bad, but I'm so scared lol. I have not let anyone cut my hair since 2017, no matter where I go, then mess it up bad!! My hair is now down to my butt. And it just gets in may way, its flat and I can't do anything with it but where it in a granny bun daily :(
Jenna!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Keep on shining Brad! That's the ultimate revenge towards the haters.❤
Brad making a video about the butterfly cut... with a butterfly hoodie 10/10
Tbh Brad is the one person who's tutorial I would trust lmao💀
Your way of helping people in tutorials and just education in general is proof you are passionate about what you do and that it’s not just about money
I had the butterfly cut for a minute but it didn’t flatter me as much as the wolf did, when I pull my hair back. It also didn’t air dry as well. So I’m back to the wolf!!!!
We appreciate you
I did the butterfly cut tutorial... First time i ever trusted a tutorial enough to acrually do it lol
This was fun.
Hair extension reaction next
3 for 3 Brad! Congratulations! You know us girls are gonna do this at home, so thanks for the tips 😊. I am getting married in a month and a half, so for you, I promise to go to a hairdresser that knows my hair! Even though you were absent a bit, your videos and personality never was. I hope you bring back doing a hair makeover series for one of your viewers. I loved that. Not only do you hear there story, but you help to reinvent them. You have no idea how powerful that is, even to us watching. Food for thought. Love you bunches. Oooo, picking outfits for someone for a couple of days was fun too. I must say, I would LOVE to be your bestie for a day. Shopping with you would be so much fun! Just a couple of girls sharing advice 😊. Consider those though. They are awesome things you have done. FYI, I know just how big your heart really is. Many don't know what you went through to get X-Mondo off the ground. I am so proud of you Brad. You have developed a masterpiece. I can't wait to see it at hairdressers everywhere, or even store shelves! Never change honey, never change. Your colors are beautiful and everyone should see every one of them when they see you. You are real, honest, fun and loving. You care about a lot more than you let on. But, girl, I got your back gorgeous! Question..... do you have preferred pronouns?
I have long hair and did a butterfly cut and it turned out SO GOOD. Thank you for your videos you are very appreciated 🙏🏼❤️
Brad you should do a video on haircuts for natural/ afro hair. I would really appreciate it, I want to try cutting my hair at home
Some people can’t afford hairdressers, I’m ok because I am a hairdresser. Some people don’t trust hairdressers.
Mine came out AMAZING love it, I'm definitely keeping it for a while. Helped my before flat wavy hair a lot. Now I wanna do curtain bangs with it since I did them last time and I liked it but it looked simple 😂😂 Also I don't go to hairdressers because I have rapunzel length and they always cut so much despite what I want or tell them. 🙄
Does Brad by any chance have a tutorial for cutting your own hair to chin-length decently, cause I desperately need it
Oh no so sad you're allergic to oat milk!
I have VERY thick hair and I’m too scared to do this😂
Yes, Brad!! You tell ‘em!!!
*VANILLA SOY MILK MATCHA* I love it!! I drink it every day.
Hi Brad! You might enjoy macadamia nut milk, I tried it from Thrive Market and it's really good, even with cereal 🙂
JENNA 💚💚💚
I’m gonna love watching this vid Brad, then cutting my hair later today! Hope you’re having a lovely Sunday everyone!
I want a haircut method for home and side part, please😊
Wait....isn't that a wolfcut?
Isn’t that unwise? 😅
I’m so glad you’re back Brad. ❤️ I’m glad you’re feeling better.
Not going to lie I do sometimes wish you would show how to do much shorter cuts I never like having long hair because migraines so I normally have my hair really short with a shaved side but blending the back alludes me
I had missed these 😭🤍
I can’t do that haircut because I’m unable to find that point/line where I’m supposed to section. It’s just all over the place :(
Don’t listen to hater hairdressers Brad! We love you 😊 I started cutting my own hair because multiple “professionals” NEVER did it how I wanted! So it’s their own fault they lost me as a customer, not yours 😅
I got so excited when I saw Jenna!! I’ve been watching her for ages and seeing my two fav YouTubers in one video makes me so happy!!😚
I hope you never feel bad about teaching people how to do their own hair! I have a chronic illness and I'm bedbound a lot and can't go to a hairdresser, but with your videos I can do it myself from bed and it helps me feel confident and beautiful which is really hard to feel when I'm sick all the time! I've always used my hair to express myself and now I still can because of you ❤️
Hi beautiful. You look amazing today and you’re doing great! 🩶
When I followed your tutorial Brad I legit cut off 8 inches 😳 I was so scared but I literally thought of you as I was doing it because I remember you saying you have to cut a lot off to get the full effect. I'm so happy with how it turned out though
Honestly, I've had SO many hairdressers not know how to do my texture of hair, and/or they completely damage it. I don't trust any hairdresser touching my hair now. I shaved my head in 2019 and growing it ever since. I've been doing all my own trims and whatnot. This is the best my hair has ever looked tbh.
Almond milk
Finally addressing the angry hairdressers. Like there’s one who asked for peoples discarded xmondo hair color for “experiments”
I have always cut my own hair.
You have several different types of tutorials, and if the people trying them don't follow directions, that's not on you. Hair dressers in my area really suck, so I'm doing it myself as best as I can.
I think it's that from looking into you that people of realize that you don't have the real experience and experience that some of those other dressers have and they seem to be more upset that you steer people in the wrong direction and then their hair is a mess coming in to get it fixed. At least that's what I can gather from videos I've watched. You also really did a terrible job on burning off that girl's hair when you dyed it. I don't think you knew what you were doing with that heavy textured hair on that poor girl. I still think you're content is fun though!
I have medium blonde hair that is fine, and I want to go platinum. Does anyone know how?
bro has severe ADHD
Brad Mondo, doing God's work one hair cut at a time.
Love your videos ❤.  I am finally learning to look after and style my own hair - all thanks to you!!!  Just wish we had your products in my country 😢.  Too chicken to cut or dye my own hair - I’ll leave that for my fab hairstylist.  But at least now he won’t shout at me for not styling his beautiful cuts! 😂😂
I feel like the reflection of the pink table gives brad sunburn vibes however it reminds me summer is coming so that’s cool
I used to be a hairdresser and I can say, those other stylist out there are wrong for hating you. If anything, you've made them more money because people always seem to mess up without experience and it's more expensive for clients to get something fixed than it would be for them to go in , in the first place. Soooooooo.... they should be thanking you 😂
Brad turning into a sheep when he's excited at the end 😅
Sorry to hear angry hairdressers attack you. I am a mother of two and have almost no time at all for myself, so I literally can't find the time to book an appointment to get my hair cut. your video tutorials have saved my hair, and I actually feel pretty in my hair again. so thank you brad for looking out for us, we appreciate it immensely. <3
I wish I had done a butterfly cut at home. Cause I paid way too much money for a cut I could have easily done at home. No more salons for me  😂
The only person who has never screwed up my hair is my husband. I am definitely Team Home Haircut. And the last time my child went for a trim the wait was gonna be 90 minutes.  Ain't nobody got time for that. So we came home, put a 3 on those clippers and got to it. Beautiful!
I followed the butterfly cut a few weeks ago and it turned out perfect!  I've been doing my own hair (cuts and dyeing) since I had to go on disability and your videos have been sooo helpful!  I always did the wolf cut until I saw the butterfly one.  Gonna be my new normal!  Oh, and do you know what the name of the curling gadget that the middle girl used is?  I love those curls!!
I’m so glad you have tutorials. You know a lot about hair and I have learned a lot from watching your videos.
Almond or cashew milk
I tried it at home, didn't video it, but rocked it, because it's so easy if people JUST FOLLOW ALL THE DIRECTIONS
I did it, but didn't record it. It turned out great!
I learned a lot from your videos. I look good and it didn’t cost me $300 every 6weeks!
My day is now complete!  I can watch Brad on YouTube again!  So inspired by you.  I am thinking about attempting this butterfly cut, just worried that I can still pull up my hair when needed.  Working in the yard and around the house,  I hate having hair in the way.  So funny, I have been growing my hair out for years to get to that long state.  Now all I ever do is braid, bun, whatever, just up.  Then I think what is the point?   But I do love it when it is down and actually styled…but, I think I need that butterfly!  ❤❤❤
Dear angry hairdressers- these videos are the reason I go see you! I cut my hair once during lock down and never again! Plus seeing all these great styles and colors makes me want to change my hair more frequently so don't be angry. People like me still need you
Not going to lie, I saw the first girls tutorial- seen that we live in same city and she had the same mentality as me- when I saw her succeed, it gave me confidence to succeed.   So funny to now see her in this video- but shout out to her.
I followed your tutorial and a seperate one for straight bangs. I love it. BUT the kicker… I did my hair with the new Xmondo sapphire colors and I FREAKING LOVE IT 💙💙💙💙
Perfect top for the video!  I cut my own hair, but it's still waist length.  I go to the salon as a treat, I choose an Aveda usually so I get the spa experience, and that's when I get the big chop or layers.
I also did this cut to myself and love the results!! Thank you, Brad. This video made me smile how supportive you are of the girls:))
I followed the tutorial and it turned out so well!! I love it!!
Hi Brad try almond milk instead of oat milk ❤
Shit, now I have to try this ☠️
I've been really grateful for the butterfly cut. I've done it several times  over the last 6 months after my hours were cut a bit at my job. I plan to go back to the professionals once I have more funds again, but I appreciate being able to look decent in the meantime! ❤
I honestly feel like it's very considerate & generous of Brad to post tutorials for those of us who can't afford the salon. The other stylists just wish they had the social media pull that Brad does lol ❤ don't sweat it hun...they just shady 😊
Brad i love you but why are you calling barely wavy hair "curly"
Matcha with soy milk you’ll never see matcha tea the same way
Hello Beautiful 😍🥰💛
Nicole used to be a youtuber, you should look her up
Someone looks like they’ve been hanging out in the sun and I’m jealous😔😔😔
I love your baby kissed sunburn Brad
Jennaaaaaa!
What is the thing that one of them use to make her hair curl. Is black and small...
Wow. That’s the energy you’re giving to other professionals in the industry you work in? F you, Brad Mondo. I have no problem with your advice- I have a problem with your fucking attitude.
Really miss your videos! Thank you so much for all your help and offering free advice, as a mom of two I really don’t have time or money to deal with actual hairdressers and the times that I have I never got the results I wanted. Thanks to you my husband was actually able to bleach money pieces on my hair and I absolutely love it ❤❤
If you're allergic to oat milk  Try Almond milk unsweetened
My name is Nicole 😂😂and I'm the same (the 3rd girl) perfectionist in my own head and impulsive as hell 😂
Yes fuck them hairdressers 😂😂
I’ve been watching Jenna Phipps regularly for years and so this was a welcome addition to the video! She is a crafting master so I have full faith in her
I haven’t found a hairstylist who can cut my daughter’s curly hair correctly so I’m thankful for you and others that show us skills. I love her hair now!
My hair is waist length without layers & tbh I love it. My hair is wavy curly so still has body! Shortest I would go is right below my boobs 😂
Sheesh
Your drama is ridiculously adorable and fun to watch 💕
Brad has saved me so much money. I'll still go to the salon when I want something professional and special, but in-between, doing it myself has been empowering.
You might need an epiPen don’t take Oak milk
I'm definetly first
Wow! I think I'm used to watching so many hair fails that I was surprised by the results! They all did amazing; they followed Brad's directions closely. I've been wanting to try this because I have fine hair and it seems to really add volume while still leaving length.
now i kind of wanna do this to myself. i usually cut my bangs and i can see them all the time, so it'd be so scary just trusting the ponytails xD
Brad u are amazing. U make people more confident also if they don’t have the money to go to a hairdresser. Fuck them you’re the queen here👑
(Cashew cream recipe below) I don't know if you are gluten tolerant/intolerant/celiac, but there is a huge issue with oats being contaminated with wheat (gluten). Certified gluten free oats even often cause reactions in celiacs. Certain oat brands are more reliably gluten free than others, but I do recommend trying a few different brands of oat milk that are gluten free to see if it makes any difference for you (I just developed gluten intolerance when I was 25). You can also make you own gluten free oat milk (easily!!!). Low stomach acid can cause also cause intolerances (happened to me - but is treatable).  Best ever and easiest recipe for cashew cream (use for anything - coffee, soups, baking, etc):  Ingredients: - 2 cups filtered cold water - 1/2 raw/not-roasted unsalted cashews Instructions: No need to soak the cashews for this recipe (I have used this recipe many times). Blend in a high speed blender or magic bullet for 30 seconds to 1 minute (until the consistency is smooth and creamy, not grainy/chunky). Keep in fridge for up to 3 days.
Thank you for your positivity Brad❤
Thank you Brad Mondo because we need life changes. Like I have a identity crisis so I am dyeing my hair brown in 2 months.
Brad I LOVE YOU
Brad is there an easy way to do a textured lob?
Finally people follow the tutorial and tada it works!!!
Aw, I love brads little rap for us ❤
I really like this cut, shape and color on you.
Yayyy you know it’s gonna be a good day when Brad uploads a video❤
Brad, you look so tan!
Wooow I was expecting a fail but thankfully they all did absolutely amazing and look so beautiful 👏👏❤❤
❤❤❤
I gave myself this haircut too and I was liviiiiiing. Loved it
Almond milk abd matcha the best try it Brad
That message needed to be said! Go Brad!
“Dead hair on my hands!”
Wow I'm so early😂 love you brad 💗💗
Yeah! F all the nasty hairdressers. You are the best!
I haven't had my hair professionally cut in almost 10 years. It's not that I don't want to, it's just that the act of attempting to secure an appointment gives me cramps. So, thank you for your sacrifice,  Brad! ❤
Try soy milk ❤
I did the cut, but I'm not able to style them properly, I feel so stupid 😢 And the heat from blow drying and styling makes my hair so frizzy and now I just wear ponytails all the time.
Omg Jenna is my favourite 🥹
I tried it myself i love it ❤😊
Is it something in the oat milk or oats in general. I cant have some of the other ingredients, you can make your own ❤
His hair looks normal again and he could be considered mildy attractive which makes this easier to watch
F*¢k the hairdressers that don't rock with Brad Mondo 😜 like who doesn't love Brad Mondo 😊🫶
This has convinced me to go for the butterfly haircut. I have curly and thin hair and usually I don't like when i have layers but I will try tomorrow!!
I’m deep cleaning and stripping my house of things I don’t need. Doing dishes as I watch this, good to see your content Brad
I am a hairdresser and I support doing your hair yourself. Sometimes its liberating. SO many stylists started out on themselves soooooo maybe they should stop judging others.
Any hair splinters on your hands? Those things hurt!
I used to cut my hair with conditioner in it because I have an Afro. It’s hard to do a dry curly cut on your own head.
When I saw that you posted I FREAKED AHHHH
Thank you Brad I’ve got 3 kids and I put every cent back into my family so broke I can only do my hair myself and you’re tutorials have equipped me with the knowledge and skills to do it myself 🙏 thank you
Brad's in his rap star era
Almond milk Brad! ❤
ALSO HELL YEAH F*** THOSE ANGRY HAIRDRESSERS LET THEM BE ANGRY ALL YOUR TIPS WORKED FOR ME CUZ I ACTUALLY FOLLOWED THEM WORD FOR WORD

Nothing like looking like a slug and being called beautiful 🥲
am i the only one that noticed the sweat shirt matches the tittle and the whole theme of the video 😂❤️ love you brad happy to see you back
love that you reacted to Jenna. Love her and your videos <3
omg 30 minuts ago i did not realize that
I did this cut a few months ago at home. I was scared and thinking about it for 6 months until I finally said fuck it just do it my hair was pass my butt so it's OK I guess. But omg I cut a lot that day it's now at waist level with so much volume and layers. For my first time I love it so much. When I leave my hair natural my wavey curls makes it look amazing it looks beautiful as well blow dried. Thank you BradMondo Im loving my hair again.
I am extremely allergic to oats soooo....it's a thing!
I missed Brad sooo much!! ❤❤❤
I can't believe other professional hairdressers give you a hard time about doling out solid advise to the masses!  There will always be a need for the pros, you're not taking anyone's job away.  There have been other people making hair tutorials on the internet for years...these gremlins are just bitter at your success. Pay them no mind!!  We love and appreciate you oodles Brad!!! Xoxo 🩷🩷🩷
I would think stylists would be getting more “correction” clients after they messed it up at home from watching YouTube videos 😂   I feel for ya with the oat milk. I use Chobani vanilla every morning in my matcha & almond/rice/cashew milk isn’t the same.
😒my hair just basically breaks like something similar 😢
now I want to try this hair cut
Omg I love Jenna!! She makes such fun video's <3
Well done Brad!! You told 'em off!!! 3 cheers to you!!🎉
WHERES THE HOODIE FROM?
Ricemilk!!!
the sweatshirt matches the whole theme of the video😂
I love your videos so so much! You always make my day and you helped bring me out of a dark place. Thank you so much Brad! Keep up the amazing work!!
I shaved my head a year ago and this video is making me feel like a haircut lmao
wow
Got the suntanned look.  ☀
Finally they wet their hair
He is so friggin cute
I'm allergic to oatmilk too and ITS THE WORST PAIN OMG
Love this!  They all turned out so good!  I would absolutely love a reaction video to Mia Maples chaotic haircut - that was a rollercoaster!!
Watching Brad be so happy when I am about to be so sad... tried to dye my bangs blue this week, didn't bleach my bangs light enough so they turned out GREEN.  So now, ROUND TWO!  Need to watch some XMONDO color videos now..
I love you Brad Mondooo ❤️❤️❤️ You are such a down to earth person and You help soooo many people to feel so confident including me.. I'm so so so happy that I found you.. You are amazing.. 😘😘😘 We missed you lately.. I'm so glad that you are back 😍💯❤️❤️❤️
I did it on myself and on my mom and it worked perfectly 😁😁😁😁 I love it. Thank you Brad 💞💞💞
HI BRAD MONDO HOW  YOU DONG  HOPE YOU DOING GREAT I LOVE YOU  LOVE DAVID
⚘ ⚘ Love it ❣❣💜❤💜❤💜❤💜😉😉
Yayy! Brad uploaded Another video 😍🥳 Too bad I probably will never be able to do a butterfly cut on my own hair 😂🤣🤦 I have the eternal buzzcut . Oh also Brad ,you def should try Almond milk with the Matcha ..it's really good .I used to love Oatmilk myself but after a while It just wasn't doing it for me.
Welcome back, Brad! 🖤🩶🤍
Are you allergic to the oat milk or the oat milk that has gluten in it?
Wow all of them were absolutely gorgeous 😍
I appreciate that brad wore a butterfly sweatshirt, we love the dedication 👏🏼
Those hair ends coming off😍 Got to love the new healthy looking hair
I love you so much for the Butterfly Cut. My Hair never looked better tbh 💕
I am so tired of the Brad slander from other stylists. They say "he ruined this persons hair" meanwhile the hair looks shiny, soft and strong. I've watched a video of a celebrity hair stylist completely destroy a womans hair. I mean it was dry and damaged, the color was horrible and it was so uneven. Everyone makes mistakes and messes up.
I just love you and youre Videos it really makes even my bad days a bit better 💚
As someone with a lot of allergies: Pea milk and macadamia milk/creamer are amazing
Brad I love your videos, some of them scare me to never try to do my hair at home, but videos like these really make me want to grab the scissors 🫢💖
people underrate proper documentation of previous work, referring to your documented prior knowledge is key to progress
Hii I'm a big fan of your work
Yep agree Fxxk y'all 😂 😂 please do more blonde colour correction etc ✂️🙏📸🥰
All I do is the butterfly cut, every 2 months I do just 1 inch to keepy ends fresh
I’m gonna be so satisfied when those ends drop to the flo,  Cause they gotta go,  So, who’s better to do that tho,  Than me, Brad Mondo.  ✂️ ⭕️
So I've done this cut since Brad showed us how.  The only difference I made was the back pony I didn't do at the very top as I found the back to be too long.  Other than that I LOVE it. Thanks Brad.
@bradmondo I followed your bleaching techniques omg your awsome 😍 it worked from red/brown hair to light rose 🌹 gold ✨️ 💛 Thank-you
Brad you have about 7.1 mil subscribers, meaning 7.1 mil LOVE watching you and LOVE the help you give us to try do our own hair... So screw the others ,do you, and thank you for helping us try, cos let's just admit , you know yourself before you on YouTube, we all had ALOT OF HAIR FAILS 😅 when it comes to cuts... So Thank you! And keep delivering the hair ambulance tools 🔥🔥🔥 ❤❤❤much love
Brad, switch to Original Ripple Milk! Made with pea protein. It's so good and very nutritious. 8 grams of protein per cup. It's amazing.
22 minutes ago!
❤❤❤
BRAD WE NEED A PIXIE TUTORIAL
Can you wear the butterfly cut with a side part? I know it's not popular, but my hair looks ridiculous with a middle part 😂.
I watched your video then gave my 10 yo daughter the butterfly haircut a few months ago & it came out SO good! As a single mom with not a lot of extra money, I’m grateful for you wanting to help those who can’t always afford trips to the salon. 💖
Yea brad!!! Loving the energy now your back !!!!🎉🎉❤❤❤
"Isn't that unwise" finished it for you Brad.  Finish your rap!
Omg Jenna 😍😍😍 She's such a great creative youtuber!
Omg I literally just did this cut, I should have filmed it lol!
Don’t be sorry Brad! We love you 🥰
ur slowly convincing me to try cutting my hair on my own but im deathly scared bc I dont have time to style my hair! So do you need to style ur hair to have a butterfly cut??? Pls tell me Bradmondo the hair god
RE Oatmilk allergy.  Get some antihistamines. A daily one like Claritin or Zyrtec and an emergency/quick acting one like Benadryl. Then look up elimination diets. Follow that for oats. Basically read all your ingredients lists to avoid anything with oats in it. Eliminate them from your diet for a few weeks and see if you notice a difference. Definitely keep a record so you notice any differences that are unexpected like headaches, sinus changes, rashes, etc.
I'm 69 and cut my hair like this about a month ago, looks good but I'm going to cut it again tomorrow, ya, I know old people shouldn't have long hair but who cares right😊. ❤ Brad mondo
Gotta love Brad for pausing everyone’s video at the wrong moment
I love Jenna Phipps! I clicked so fast when I saw her in the thumbnail. She's such a lovely soul.
No because i followed brad's tutorial and best decision of my life everrr . 100% recommend
Brad you are a great teacher. I went from black Asian hair to basically platinum blonde at home by myself. I only followed all the advice I've gotten from all the bleach fails videos I've watched over the years. I love your videos sooo much ❤❤
I got people putting ponytails on their foreheads😂😂
Oat milk was my favourite alternative milk because of the consistency and the neutral taste that doesn't affect the flavour of my coffees and matchas but then I discovered pea milk and let me tell you it's a game changer! If oat milk doesn't agree with you anymore you should try it 😊
slay bestie 😮😮😮
I miss you so muchhhhh!!! ♥
Yeah, I've seen some of the hate from other hairdressers. It seems like a bit of jealousy.  I won't go to a hairdressers because of 2 bad experiences, I appreciate your videos.
what's scary tbh
You can change to pea milk 👍
I hardly think that teaching people how to cut their own hair is going to leaves crickets in salons across the world🙄 At least I don’t have a hate on for you 😂
Glad u went off on the other hair dressers. That one guy goes hard and gets hella mad when he talks about you. I hate it.
I do appreciate brad's tips on cutting your own hair, i personally can't afford to go to a hairdresser so i have been cutting my own for years, now i can just do it a little better
It's nice to know you took the time off social media but I'm glad to see you make new content. Love you brad
I'm sorry you're dealing with angry hairdressers - I'm in a situation where I literally do not have the free time to get my hair done, and being able to follow your butterfly cut tutorial did SO MUCH for my mental health and well-being.  Without something simple that I could rely on, I would have 100% just hacked off most of my hair in stress.  So THANK YOU.
I missed being called beautiful🥲❤.
Wow!😂
Brad darling, I'm so happy to see you back! You do you, boo. Always. Ignore any haters. And take any breaks you need in the future. Screw anyone that opposes. We love sitting with you to gasp at the bad hair vid reaction content. But totally get how it can become annoying doing the same thing over and over. Thanks for giving this social phobic girl a feeling of hanging with a friend. When ever you can.  😊 Stay beautiful!  Sorry for all the edits. I'm awkward. Lol
❤❤❤can’t wait to get my hair professionally done and extensions installed for my bday in two weeks
Can you do almond milk? Almond matcha is pretty good
Brad you can def try your matcha tea with soy milk. That's what I use in my coffeeseand teas and ...everything.
I'm so glad you're feeling better and you're back!
I went to a hairdresser recently, somehow left with bangs but I'm not that mad about it. I got a long wolfcut lol, got my haircut on a whim, literally the night before I was texting my friends that I wanted to cut my hair and hours later I'm texting them from the hair salon and they said I was the most decisive person they knew lol. The reason I went to the hairdresser was because the last time someone at home cut my hair (my aunt) she accidentally gave me bangs and I had to suffer for so long growing them out, they were way too thick and short but the bangs I have now are thinner and longer which look better.
Great video as always! I am glad you are back Brad 💕
OMG! I thought you said OPIATEmilk not oatmilk @6:42 🙈🙈🙈
Use almond milk or coconut milk….cashew milk is amazing
Love the hoodie matching with the theme lmao
Love it when Brad posts a video 😊
So glad you're back!!!!!!  I really hope you react you Mia Maples!!!!!! Finally!!!! We've been waiting!!!!
I just cut it 🎉 it’s aaaalll most good 😌 Hairdressers are under the delusion that in Podunk City they can charge prices like NYC 😡
hey brad
You know I’ve been thinking I have curly hair what would happen if I did a butterfly cut?
There is almond milk coconut milk and soy milk
I do not even wait for a second to click on Brads Videos it’s like reflex. I see his video and I watch it immediately ♥️
Oat milk sucks, use almond milk
I did it and I am happy with the result. I realized I have a nice wave pattern I have been man handling for years! I changed products and my hair is so pretty now.
I did it too and it looks great!!!! Thank you... I would like your suggestions about the scissor as well
I gave myself the butterfly haircut it worked out perfectly lmao it was so easy and my hair has literally never looked better in my life. Never going back
My daughter works in a very high end salon and she has tried multiple times to get the hairdressers to go do community service and give free haircuts at a women’s shelter….the answer is I don’t cut hair for free.  Hairdressers we all don’t have enough money left at the end of the month to go to a salon
I love that brads back. Always makes my day. 💜💜💜
Cashew/almond milk as a combo is my next favorite alternative milk! It’s thick because of the cashew, but the almond balances out that cashew flavor and waters it down so it’s not THICKK.
Earlyy i love your videoss!
I’m so early for once 😭
Haha loved that intro
✨Not first😗✌️✨
