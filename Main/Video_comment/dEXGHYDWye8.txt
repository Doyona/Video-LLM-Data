Yes, Bandicoot Month is June, but I cheese-grated my whole knuckle off recently. I wish I was joking. I'm in agony. Let's just say it's June 33rd. This won't hurt though - Fall Guys is now free! Download here: https://pixly.go2cloud.org/SH3I4  *Also, the 4K quality of the video is still processing - please give it some time if you wanna see the video in the best possible quality!
Caddy is the only youtuber whose joke can fall flat and i would still laugh
Surprisingly, someone found cash bandiloot somewhere in the uk
10:37
11:20 For those curious, I did my best to translate this intro. It says something about Cortex kidnapping Tawna, and Crash setting off to rescue her.
Cadd: what's the cure for aids? Uka Uka: that's not my problem. at least he's in character
9:43 the guts to put this in a sponsorship is crazy
he's 28 but looks 30
27:48 Caddicarus can break an android phone in half with his bare hands
5:32 Please tell me there's a meme somewhere with Caddie's face wearing those goggles.  "I think I've seen too much."
3:48 That's Shin Getter Robo from Getter Robo series!
Before putin pooped on a tin
1:39 lol.
11:20 I'm not a Russian, so take this translation with a grain of salt.  "DOCTOR CORTEX KIDNAPS CRASH'S GIRLFRIEND - TAWNA, SO THAT CRASH FULFILLS HIS EVIL PLAN. CRASH REFUSES AND GOES TO SAVE HIS BELOVED..."  I used google ai so of course, it'll probably be wrong, please correct me if it is.
Oh me oh my
hahahaha wet
I remember that after this video I tried looking myself for Crash Bandicoot bootlegs in Play Market and I found a game that was just a port of Crash Tag Team Racing 😅
8:37  Where’s Squidward?
I love how he reads the text in that GBC game.
2:46 MMMMMMMMMM
*3:28** “ I  ‘m commi-* *nq…”* 🗣️🗣️🗣️🥛🥛🥛
"Crash, Alter evil to be straight" is probably one of my favourite mangled engrish sentence's.
33:24 Cash Bandiloot...??? Is that for real? And Crash Jumpscare!
1:38 slap! 1:39 bandicoot strut walk
8:12 song name????
7:56 yaa
1:39 the lighting makes this look like a GTA 5 mod
The funny thing about the Crash Genesis/MD bootleg having apples is that those fruits are prominent in the Japanese canon.
I just realized "King Chicken" is a Kokatrimon from the digimon series
Fun fact: At 11:20. The text reads   Доктор Кортекс похищает девушку Краша — Тейвна для того, чтобы Краш выполнил его зловещий замысел. Креш отказывается и отправляется спасать свою возлюбленную.   Which literally means  Doctor Cortex kidnaps Crash’s girlfriend — Tawna — for the purpose of Crash carrying out his evil scheme. Crash refuses and sets off to save his beloved.  And Креш is wrong, it should be Краш
21:10 Tom and Jerry Scream
4:24 NOW THIS IS A STORY ALL ABOUT HOW I CAUGHT EBOLA AND THEN I DIED
16:17 I swear this man’s one pitch meeting away from starring in his own A24 movie.
awwwwwwww nooooooooo im 3 years late for the fall guys promo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow, I didn't expect it to be something from Brazil, and yes, I am Brazilian, but I love your channel, but I prefer to live in the United States.
1:38 Florida Twinsanity GIF
4:30 GRAND DAHAD?!?!
14:54  this is a retexterd flintstone game
28:14 Get your Nobbly Brown Thing On A Stick today! (İt's not shit, we promise)
22:15 WHO CALLED THEMSELVES HALALMEAT!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!??!?!?!
3:26 CRASH, USE STONER SUNSHINE
The game over on 5:17 might be from Kabuki Klash's victory screen in mirror matches where the loser poofs and becomes an animal
11:19 Actually, for anyone curious, this is what the screen actually says:  Доктор Кортекс похищает девушку Креша - Тейну, для того, что бы Креш выполнил его зловещий замысел. Креш - отказывается и отправляется спасатъ свою воэлюбленную... Нажмите Старт  Doctor Cortex kidnaps Crash's girlfriend, Teina [sic], so that Crash can fulfill his evil plan. Crash refuses and goes to save his beloved. Press Start
As an American, moaning about a three hour drive is laughable. Some do that for their job.
4:32 it’s your… Grand Dad?
33:08   “Ha ha, hahaha. Ha. Wet.” Is so real 🥀🥀🥀
min 3:54 is that a Kokatorimon?
5:31 That caught me offguard LOL
according to IMDb caddy is a TV show with 8 seasons
Speed 2x then it’s hell 33:35

phone play store ppsspp crash bandicoot was not what I thought i would see today.
9:20 something i adore is how utterly stupid spons is. He has no sense of danger and the iq of a child, i feel like his favorite food is probably apple sauce and dino nuggets.
I don't think that's a good product..  but oh well- 23:49
27:47 everyone's reaction to free Palestine:
Not calling them "Crash BandiBootlegs" was a missed opportunity
Halalmeat is in here somewhere. Let's hunt them down, John wick style.
5:32 Looking Respectfully
"Dude, I just want a good birthday present this year! Is that too much to ask?”  The fact you put any sort of trust in bootleg programmers to give you good quality was honestly the first mistake you made throughout this whole video, Caddy.
good time watching this.
Android is a Hell of a lot less strict about people actually using their phones. It's a personal mobile device, where Apple always has certain restrictions kept in place that makes it feel corporate and boring. At least their phones run well... I guess It's why so many people stay on Android. Because those phones allow you to have full customization on your phone. Be allowed to fully change the font that's shown, have images set up on your keyboard, completely change all app icons on a whim, you can do anything with an Android. Apple just allows you to change from light to dark, and... I guess have preset ringtones. That's it. For the context of this video, the Play Store basically says "Yeah, do whatever, we do not care." You can upload whatever you want onto the Play Store thanks to it using a .apk file structure, where Apple has all apps under extensive review so you don't upload garbage (which isn't the case anymore, thanks shotty mobile game template). Because of that, all the bootleg Crash games are on Android. I'm assuming there aren't many console releases with those NES bootleg systems, likely because of the spin. I mean, without it, it's not even Crash. Most of those games are simply just putting a character in a specific bad game and calling it a day, which is why I mention that. And there isn't really any NES game where you spin to break stuff, so... yeah.  I'm pretty sure a big reason why a majority of them didn't even open is because they were made on much older versions of Android. It's a common problem almost every shotty-game on the Play Store goes through because they've been sitting there with cobwebs piling up for YEARS as the "devs" just kinda stopped caring. I'm sure they didn't care at all when they uploaded them given the quality... yeesh.
25:50 orgasmic groan.
Scott the woz looks at your trip to THE NORTH and says "First time?"
14:58 that game is a knockoff of the flintstones game
they've hit the bandicoot tower
23:37 embedded pet hair
Oh look, it’s Spons Bandicoot
0:54 BANDICUMS
4:23 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 6:19  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 10:51 11:26 23:45
i take super crashing bird over crash of the titans every day of the shweek
Caddi hunting a pokie machine themed after crash is not the weirdest thing he has done
why you drive in the wrong side of the road and in the wrong side of the car?
23:46 BAHAHAHAAHAH THIS FEELS ILLEGAL
Yeah the first game he looks sad I'm pretty sure as a Digimon game.
6 hours to drive for nothing? Remember caddy you 200% crash bash and took almost 11 hours
I must say. The adventure was grand and was worth it.
Since when is crash bandicoot a fox?!
What’s the name of that music that’s playing when you’re driving to that pub?
3:55 Bro that’s a Kokatorimon
28:48  LOOK EVERYONE!! ITS PEPSIMA- PEPSIWOMAN!
Fitting that the first game was made by a company called "Sintax" when the game is one giant mistake.
Caddy was 19 miles away from me. I didn't even know that
5:27 hearing Ollie laugh made this scene so much better. 😂😂
22:15 "WHO CALLED THEMSELVES HALALMEAT!?!?"
Hang on i played the game after he did🤨
30:59 tweedle
I looked at the reviews for Zobies Run. They were saying in an update that they were improving the game via feedback.  How the hell they managed to get any feedback when all of the reviews are talking about Crash Bandicoot is anybody’s guess
Happy birthday for this month, Daddy Caddie
3:52  IS THAT COCKATRIMON FROM DIGIMON??? Or....whatever it's name was?!
This is probably the first time I've seen him break character 5:30
8:45 *ĜÆŔƁ* button
I maybe played crash once at a friends house but I love your style so much it’s hilarious
He should review crash tag team kart racing on android
Does anyone have any mind bleach to erase the image of crash wearing knee high boots.
Reasonable drive for a special day trip. Detroit is 3 hours from my home, and when I was going to University there my Mom kept coming to pick me up and take me home for the weekend and I had to ask her to stop because she was doing two 6-hour round trips every weekend just because she missed having me at home.
39:18 spons lane
2 Years late, but that zombies run game is actually a bootleg of another mobile game called zombie highway... wow
5:26 Crash with guns Easy does it easy does Im too small and i cant reach that
3:53 is. Is that my main man Kokatorimon???
11:20 correct translation: Doctor Cortex kidnaps Crash’s love - Tawna, so that Crash can complete his evil plan. Crash refuses and sets off to save his loved one.  [ Press Start ]
WAYNE
That's foam not a phone. Thank you goodbye 😂
31:21 I was unaware caddy became a member of Parliament good for him
I don't know what the consensus, but I think this is one of the best post-reboot Caddicarus episodes. The jokes and comedic timing are on point.
CASH BANOOKA
3:52- isn't that a random digimon? (edit, it really is a random dang digimon)
16:16 This is my favorite Caddicarus character.
11:22 oh russian language It's so pleasant to see it in your videos Btw I'm your fan from Russia and I've been watching your vids since 2014 I think, maybe earlier  Big respect for what you doing and hope to see you at your 80s still making videos for us
11:19 the text in the image says : "Doctor Cortex kidnaps Crash's girlfriend - Tavena (misspelled Tawna), so that Crash would commit his EVIL plan Crash refuses, and sets off to rescue his lover... Press Start (that's pretty obvious xd)" I'm a native russian speaker btw
4:03 Why is there a Digimon 😭
3:43 That is Shin Getter 1 goddamnit!!!!! XD
That knock off console. Here in America we used to be able to see those for sale at flea markets. They are famiclones. With bad emulation and bad controllers
2:17 they gave Crash a penis 😂
27:46 the way it cuts to "that's not problem" and then to him breaking the phone is pure comedy gold
35:02 daddicarus
17:19 I’m gonna go back to reading to there and back again by frolo baggins because that fictional character at least made something good, hell I’d even take wario’s microgames each as stand alone games or even queen coral’s scrolls that are in a fictional language called dragon and like more that twice as tall as me and underwater over that game developed by crash bandicoot.
"WHO CALLED THEMSELVES HALALMEAT" lives rent free in my head
Eyyyyy gee cross! Good old 206 bus and Stockport ah a 201 bus sorry I love seeing signs to familiar places
0:35 “WOW. Thanks DJ Mouth.”
12:32 - 12:54 Trying not to audibly laugh at this made me cough my own lungs out
3:19  pe-
27:05 eat fruit
5:12 It looks more like Garfield to me.
26:24 now all we’re missing is Dino crisis 2
23:36:  And now, one of the most drawn out jokes in the whole series.
0:51 I can't stop hearing it as "bandicunt"
29:32 this is hands down my favorite caddy joke of all time
POPE FRANCIS IS DEAD!
Hey caddy what do you get when you collect all the gold eggs in crash team racing nitro-fueled? Caddy: 3:54
Remake these please
What kind of controller were you holding in the Genesis segment?
27:48, I hope he didn't break his actual phone here.
😂😂😂😂
Cad has joined the pantheon of my spirit animals
21:23 It’s The Better Man!
EAT FRUIT
Diarrhea
i need the sequel to crash the v2 bandi pronto
22:50 Caddicarus: where killing your stepkids is hilarious.
28:01 GRUNKLE STUNKLE WINS THE FUNKLE BUNKLE
Thats 'king chicken' is a digimon called Akatoimon - literally the sprite for the digimon, just very pixilated.
14:03 DOOR DOOR REFERENCIA LOS NAUTRASHEROS SEGUIMOS GANANDO
17:30 Sounds so funny out of context
23:56 Krash Bandi. Hang on! I said that!! Did that I make this!?
24:32:  You could ask Ripper-Roo for his one.
27:02 For everyone who wants to EAT FRUIT!
34:53 my phone randomly startedd buffering at this point, and somehow it worked and made the bit funnier.
23:31 *Embedded Pet Hair!*
27:03 I found it
It took me until 34:15 to realize that the music playing in the cash bandiloot story was music from A Hat In Time. I love being alive.

13:35 bro those fake NES cheap pieces of plastic can be bought everywhere, ebay amazon even etsy. do not worry you did not get the one from Brazil specifically, they are literally all the same thing wrapped in a different color plastic shell
3:46 I am pretty sure that is a bitcrushed Justice from guilty gear
Bandicunth sounds like a sler
Cash banocas booted leggings are guite odd
7:29
11:19 if you’re wondering what that actually says it’s just retelling the story of crash 1

5:24 CASH BAZOOKA
11:20 понятно. Well if u really want a correct translation, I will provide it later. If I'll not forget of course  Just to clarify: there's nothing special. Just can say that's Tawna here translated incorrectly in my opinion. But overally it's just... Ugh yes. I may translate never cuz rn I have no time for that-
Is it just me or is there also a bit of minions in there like crash bandicoot Angry Birds and minions? 30:48
29:30 Put a cowboy hat on it.
13:08 Ofcourse it's Brazil. 😅
*W O A H*
6:44 GHOSTBUSTERS!!!
Hey caddy! I know you like ya boy cash banooca but I have a game which is highly based on cash! You see, it's called antonblast! You may have heard of it! It focuses more on speed, but is very similar to the bandicoot himself! You may wanna try it!
There is no escape. 6:45
35:43 we know you better then that daddy caddy
I found Cash Bandiloot. It's at the Waterhole in Skegness
as of right now in 2025, there is the same thing as super crash battle adventure but with tag team racing for psp, and it's called "crash tag team kart racing" so it was so close
19:21 why not.
tweet tweet tweety tweet
I actually played super crashing bird when I was younger
13:05 oh it's that console from the 8-bit remix of gangsta's paradise
Caddicarus is the best British video game reviewer i ever watched. Always laugh.
Yes u can get ur cash banooca 2022 plushie medium rare for real! 7:28
27:49 uka uka is homophobic
I want Uncle Funcle as a presenter for the next Streamy Awards or the Oscars.
I have a question for caddy, why are 90% of your videos one hour long?
.....I miss Coddy 32:48. Hope to see him in the Christmas video.
6:54 - "Crash himself doesn't look like an orange toilet with suspenders" - no the americans just elected that as their president. Minus the suspenders, perhaps.
So three things about the crash bootlegs on android they're probably  -a terrible game -a rom in disguise(crash of the titans) -or malware
You know you could to eBay or check whoever now owns the company or just you know look around plus the north.... It's cold n wet up there Sirmugman
32:07 I realize they used the numbers from SM64

1:55 "Nope, I'm not touching that! Bye, everyone! Have a nice life!" 3:39 "Your god, I am!" *[Dobby]* 5:27 Caddy magnifies his eyes 8:10 "And why is that? YOUR MOM!" 11:20 "Yep, I don't need to see any more, BYE!" 14:41 "Crash! Are you reaching for me? Are you reaching out to touch my heart?" 17:20 "Crash Bandicoot is going to steal my location data!" 19:50 "Hello? *[gasp]* There was no one there!" 21:47 "WHO CALLED THEMSELVES HALAL MEAT?!?!" 23:53 "I said that... did I make this??" 25:07 "This game's too good for this Earth! HAVE IT, GOD!" 26:57 "Can I command an army of angry bats?" "Anything is possible if you try!" 29:31 "I got tuba-rculosis..." 30:36 "F**K NO" 32:05 "WOAH! NO! DON'T DO IT! I'M SO SORRY! STOP IT! NO! NO, IT'S-- DON'T TAKE ME AWAAAYYY!" 33:34 "A friend of mine called HWAYNE" 34:50 "He's my son, I have to check he's clean..." 36:01 "THE NORTH" 37:01 "I'm getting some looks, I can't even describe them, they are looks" 38:51 "It's me, the best present I could have ever wanted! Thank you so-- AH!"
16:37 _mmmmmmmmmmOOOOoooooo_
i have been to that exact pub this is scary
As a Russian, i don’t think you understand how much I appreciated the “Putin” pun.
I never laughed so much in my life
wheres squidwart
23:35 We Happy Few?!
3:55 stroke attack moment
29:59 I have that exact game except it’s a different game
I’d like to see caddy do videos based on other platformler games and I even thought the names for the video like the fast world of sonic games or the cute yet creepy world of Kirby games, but what do you think like, heart on this comment if you thinks it’s a good idea and comment if you don’t prefer that to happen.
EAT FRUIT
29:08 "I WANT TO JUM!" Probably my favorite moment of the video, second only to the horrifying inflatable jumming doll, the tubaculosis bit, the Eat Fruit bit, and... well, to be fair, pretty much all the other bits in no particular order, this is one a those I rewatch frequently just for the giggles.
9:45 pov your a new raising artis but you do something 10 years ago that bad and you got cancel
6:19 “CALL NOW AND RECEIVE A FREE TOASTER FOR YOUR SANDWICH” toastes hand “OOOOOOOOO”

This video made me Jum
38:35 that is long drive but my school once had a field trip to trade college that was over 8 hours round trip. i was not happy to learn it was just a trade school since there’s a college arguably better barely 30 minutes from our high school

26:46 *demon noises intensifies*
14:47 caddy,that’s the man from crash of the titans not cash banooca!

But this isnt crash bandicoot!....         its.... Crack bunker doot
11:20 the Russian text reads “doctor cortex kidnaps crash’s girlfriend Tavena to have crash carry out his evil plan. Crash refuses and goes to save his love”

People have made better crash games in Dreams on ps4
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 omg i cant stop maan
caddy offhandedly mentioning Beatmania makes this video less than 6 degrees of separation from huge beatmania fan contests where they make the songs and levels and music videos
The reason that the Google Play store is the one with all the bootlegs is because when making a game in unity, putting it on IOS takes forever and might not even happen even after doing everything required. Meanwhile, if it’s a game and you have a Google account then you can put a game on Google Play. With Nintendo and Sega and what not it’s a lot more shit to go through with copyright lawsuits and manufacturing physical copies and making a game using that specific devices dev kits and hardware, making it damn near impossible to make a knockoff bootleg game, unless it’s easier to get away with copyright theft in your country and if you have easier access to a Gameboy or Genesis Dev Kit. Don’t get me wrong, there are plenty of bootleg knock offs on IOS and Console and even Steam sometimes, it’s just so much harder to get away with stealing a million dollar companies IP with those ways, and it’s impossible to either Develop the game to begin with, or put the game onto the store in general.
11:10 Be Glad The Responsables Aren't BMB
How weird. I came across that Cash Bandiloot by chance last year.
19:36 Thomas and friends
When the music stoped in crash advance 4 I was like "oh God... NO NO NO NO THIS IS SONIC.EXE ALL OVER AGAIN"
DOOR DOOR
A while ago, like a year ago, I was in a Wetherspoons up in Scotland and actually saw one of the Cash Bandiloot machines 😆

Wait crash advanced 4 is just rayman sunshine of trip
4:22
All right I've been seeing this for years, what is up with this dude and really nice cars? He was driving a mustang on the road trip and there's an S2000 in his driveway.
We wouldn't officially see King Chicken until the Neon Circus Grand Prix in 2019.
I wonder how many recognised the theme for steptoe and son in the first knockoff

Fall guys best game
Okay crazy fox looks like if you mix lammy,sailor moon,and crash bandicoot 💀💀💀
there's additional context for Crash Advance 4 actually, the makers of this game have actually made several other games exactly like this. and by exactly like it I mean it's the exact same game but reskinned for whatever franchise they felt like ripping off (like mario, sonic, lord of the rings, even shrek). every single game has the exact same wonky, super ghostbusters-esque  music too. legit one of the most hilariously confusing series of games I've ever witnessed
What time is it?
17:30
22:11 Fun fact, I only just found out like, a couple weeks ago there actually is something called Halal meat. I thought Caddy was just doing this to make up a goofy nickname
3:54... well he is now officially a Crash character

39:11 WALL OF FLESH HUNGRY SOUND LES GOOOO
B-b-bandicons 💀 got me dying
12:03 - I'd say they're mangos.

When my cousin was young, he used to call Crash, “Cash Bandicook” and he called Coco “Coke”
11:26 lmao
At 0:08 crash bandicoot says help
10:02 Terraria sound effect
Not you mocking Banana Kong
11:28
I've seen a variant of Crash the fox Bandi called Super Mario Run. It's just that game but with Mario instead.
I dont think people give enouth credit to the genious that is 24:53 "Oh hole! a shit."
HELLO IM SPONS WILLIONS!
24:52  Caddy: "Oh hole, a shit! Well I just broke the only box I could use to get around it, so what do I do now?" AVGN: "You can just walk over it."
Jumming is actually a form of farming
28:00 This is by far my favorite Caddicarus moment 😂
2:03 the fact that sin tax is basically a thing 2 make ppl quit their bad habits by raising the prices on cigarettes, booze, etc makes this even better
Considering Caddy has basically done every official Crash Bandicoot related thing ever, and this video covering fan made projects related to Crash, I think I know what Caddy's next Bandicoot Month video should be about. Crash Bandicoot fanfiction.
How do I play Yoshi's Story? Aku-Aku: 27:33
I think i have watched this episode at least 3 times aha, Because of your sense of humour and your delivery is fantastic.  I understand its a long process making the videos. But I always look forward to a new one from you👍🏻
23:49 *♪cause we'd rather have a bowl of embedded pet hair!♪*
26:28 that’s actually kind of impressive. A full port?
19:23 impressive that the App Store recognized this as a Crash Rip-off when the name is so off
I know it's been a year, but you need to look into the world of brasilian bootlegs. all of our DVD players came with disks that had massive collections of bootleged games.
15:56 - 15:57 Don't you mean "Eugruntled"?? Kinda like the antonym of Distress is Eustress
19:47  "And its about as fun to deal with as TACO BELL BUM WEE."
6:18 OOOOOOO. - Caddy
That first GBC game is so funny to me because they keep using pictures of Shin Getter Robo from Getter Robo Armageddon (or one of the many Super Robot Wars that uses Shin Getter Robo) and that giant chicken looks like Kokatorimon/Cockatrimon from Digimon.
28:44 What the Hell is Jumming?
23:04 lol
Its finny, bc Roadkill is a DOUBLE rip off. Its ripping off Cashew Bazooka's name, and the app name for Zombies Run!, a legit and amazing fitness app. AND THEN its just a Temple Run but with a car. Amazing
5:27 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Years later his videos are still iconic
I love the consistency of AntDude being Crash's voice in these videos
Fun fact: "Gruntle" is a real word which means "to grunt." He grunts in satisfaction from playing Kash Banooka neez
Bro complained about a 3 hour drive 🤣  3 hours one way in the USA doesn't even get you out of most states 🤣
4:31 DRAND DAAAD!

I like how at 8:27 Caddy references all the shitty .exe creepypastas that sonic.exe spawned all those years back and makes Crash be one of them. Someone has got to have made that at least once.
I wish I jummed
23:45 embedded pet hair 24:28 challenge 12:30 WOAH
3:52 that’s kocotorimon… it’s a digimon… what he’s doing in a crash bandicoot game idk

28:50 AAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAA NOOOOOOOO!
Was just rewatching this with my brother who is over for Easter. I was drinking coffee. I desperately tried to swallow my drink instead of spitting it out when something made me laugh. What I ended up doing was getting the coffee up my sinuses and "down the wrong pipe." I sat coughing, wheezing, scrabbling at the choker necklace I was wearing. My brother saying and doing nothing all the while... The fact I'm just getting over COVID and have no smell or taste is probably a good thing at the moment.  Sure makes an Easter to remember! Thank you always for sharing your comedy genius.
If the British film industry decide to do a comedy road trip movie following a bunch of gaming YouTubers, Caddy has to be in the cast!
Played Crash Bandi, Good Game
5:32 this explains what this video is
5:26
I'm kinda surprised that Caddy didn't look at that version of The Jungle Book for the NES, where they flat out replaced Mowgli with Crash Bandicoot, and they just called it Walt Disney's Crash. On top of that, that wasn't the only tampered with version of The Jungle Book, we also have The Lion King where Mowgli, as Jontron said it best, was replaced by a bipedal lion. Oh and also......the Mowgli-lion hybrid creature twerks, possibly as an idle animation.
18:52 - 🙃🙃
35:53  That is my car in the background
32:12 is a classic
3:41 Seriously _WHY_ is Shin Getter Robo here?!?  I mean...if Cortex ever did manage to get his hands on it, Crash wouldn't stand a chance. So, fair enough that he conquered the world in this game.
5:33 this moments makes me lol every time
Eat Fruit!
Imagine if you went to heaven, but God says, "HELLO I'M SPONS"
Anyone with or whomsoever finds a Cash Bandiloot machine PLZ, show it to Caddy his nxt birtday!
26:57 comedy gold
Caddy fun dact: Crash advance 4 is one of the famous bootlegs templates for the gba so if you are going to cover more bootlegs remember this comment caddy.
"Give me five One Two Three  Four Five" "Caddicarus 2022"
Caddi... we want more!
This channel seems to be the definition of "random = funny". Not really my type of humor, but looks like a lot of people like it, so good for you.
videos to watch while I download portal on 66% discounted price
6:22  Seriously How Did Not *Insinuate* You're Own Hand Caddy‽
I think there's not many Crash Bandicoot Bootleg games is because Crash is a 3D game series  which is what most people see Crash as unlike Mario and Sonic which both began as 2D games and 3D Bootleg games are harder to make than 2D bootleg games.
23:49 - "'Cos we rather have a bowl of embedded pet hair!" X-D
That character at 4:02 looks like the chicken villain from Digimon Adventures. I searched it, he is called "Kokatorimon"
5:33 it had me howling
CaddiTheDaddy never fails to impregnate me With quality content.
"I fear no man....but that thing" Spons in the background: "hello iam spons" "It scares me"
23:40 i eat microwaves
20:39 i actually grew up on the REAL Zombie roadkill (it got delisted ages ago) it played... slightly better? I mean it was still a 2010s iphone game but it had like upgrades and stuff- it was a fun time killer
29:30 made me laugh way more than it should've
27:46 i just like this joke for some reason and i dont know it why ( :
To people who see this I genuinely beg you to subscribe cuz this made he curl up and also made me cry from laughter😂😂
3:30
It's only Crash with a shotgun.  Crash Bandishoot.
6:18 Best Weird Al impression ever.
23:44
25:46 When someone asks you if your phone can run Crysis.
16:50: BOUNS ROUND!!!!
BRAZIL MENTIONED! Btw I've had that console.
30:31 You're welcome.
Who ordered Jontron DLC here? But yet we need it
Theres a Cash Bandiloot in my local pub, they just put it there!!!
36:33 - 36:54
2:37 Game boy color/Game boy advance machine  I'm pretty sure that's what it's supposed to be
Im not australlian im spons! -spons probably
I'm late on this but....  Why the hell are there so many games that called Crash Bandicoot a f**king fox instead of... you know... A BANDICOOT?
I know this is ancient by now, but the Karoto is actually a rebranded polystation. Those are somewhat much easier to find reliably online, if you want to waste your money.
32:10 I think this is the funniest thing I've ever seen, im crying
Is that Shin Getter Robó in the poorly pixelated cuscenes for the first game?
I always thought my grandfather looked like crash bandicoot 😂
the foreshadowing is insane
Caddy driving to Manchester for Cash Bandiloot machine for content is the most insane thing I’ve ever seen and I love it.
"If I can't get some tissue paper, then we're gonna have an ISSUE PAPER 🤬‼️" That took me ALL THE WAY out idk why 😭
EAT FRUIT!
Fesh Pince
EAT FRUIT!
16:56 fun fact: Tee Lopes made music for Banana Kong 2.
With Crash on the Run officially dead, seeing these bootlegs is quite uncanny.
"If you couldn't tell, I'm not Chinese. I'm Caddy." I really love that dumb line.
19:38 because its a genuinely good game
Fresh really do the tank engine 19:36
25:45
1:42 proof caddy is his own Nationality
It is not bandicunt yet at this current point in time
I'm here from the future to tell everyone Caddy's video get even better (I KNOW RIGHT? How is that even possible??) Thanks for making an old lady, in the future, smile every day Caddiconkers ❤️
Yaa 8:01
I'm sorry but finding Spons Lane on your ill-fated drive to and from Manchester was destiny.
Reminder for myself. Funnest bit 12:30
5:31 you can tell olly is rolling on the floor laughing
6:18
6 years later and his humor is still top notch

17:20 this is a hint that Crash’s next game will involve stealing peoples information online

6:18 call now and receive a free toaster for your sandwich!
4:22 Best Part! XD
28:13 - Brain freeze?
26:46 HELL
3:41 Shin Getter 1! So Crash Bandicoot is officially part of Getter canon, and therefore we'll see him in SRW very soon!
I love british Jon tron
2:24 I would be genuinely terrified if I saw this thing running after me in the woods
‘Trick question, Don’t care!’  - Daddy Caddy
Ngl, the story of the first bootleg could actually make up for a great Crash story. Cortex finds an all powerful object and gets divine powers. Things like King Chicken would have to be removed (maybe replaced by Aku Aku), but if written correctly and extended on, this could actually be cool.
Caddi, Don't be alarmed, But I think you might have a Banandicoot problem in your back yard.
1:36 there crash bandicoot bootlegs
"TWEET TWEET TWITTY TWEET" is now on the "my favourite caddi quotes" list. (Trust me. It gets ever longer.)
18:58  Trans Bandicoot lmao
Crash Bandibootlegs
*”kash banooka”*
I still enjoy swsh over s/v because I enjoyed it for longer and had more fun playing. If anyone disagrees, good, Pokémon wouldn't be interesting if let's go Eevee was always viewed as better.
3:28 CANIBAL CORPSE REFERENCE 😱😱😱😱😱😱
5:26
3:55 it looks like Kokatorimon from digimon for me
5:26 16:12 18:50 27:40 28:40
I wonder what that Crash II Advance bootleg was a reskin/mistranslation of, ngl.
15:56 did you know gruntled is a real word?
Hi caddicarus I am your biggest fan so could you please do a  visiting Peppa pig world video please❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
3 hours is long to british people? thats a day trip for americans
You gotta wonder how many people over the years moved in and out of Caddy neighborhood with all his shenanigans?
I seriously need to know how caddy did the phone scene with a straight face 😂😂😂😂
I live near the pub he went to and I've gotta say it is the weirdest feeling to be casually watching a video and suddenly there's a shot of a motorway that's 10 minutes away from my house
spoons is creepy
16:21 Well someone clearly never has heard of a man known as Yomarz.
11:22-Dr Kortex stole Krash's gf so that Krash would do what he wanted and fall for eeeevil trap...but Krash decided to go save his fam instead  What in the actual--?
0:41,1:36,3:39,11:33,18:51,19:50,,20:08,21:10,24:35,27:55,28:48,29:30,30:31,31:20,32:12,32:50,33:24,33:09
So are we just gonna ignore Caddy driving around in a goddamn Mustang?! Because damn...Caddy doing alright for himself 😂
alter evil to be straight
At 13:13 the pistol shown is the tf2 stock pistol for the scout and engi
Super crashing bird looks like a furrby
31:37 yes, yes i am. Its been a few years now.
That hissing and pissing line caught me off guard. I'm definitely gonna start using that one.
Well i can explain one thing, reason there are more bootlegs on the android over the iPhone is because android dev accounts are a 1 time $25 fee while iphone is $100 a year. Its going to be way more of a weird market on the android because its more cheap to produce games.
25:45 I literally died laughing at this the glitchy bass boost and then it immediately crashing is just funny 😭
Crash Bandicoot? More like Cheese Branoica
goddamn i am occasionally rewatching these videos and the wretched Jelly-vomit-drop at the end killed me completely this time xD good medicine when feeling dead sick
A angry shoe and HUMPTY DUMPY WITH A SHOTGUN- 😂😂😂😂
[American] why is a 3 hour drive so bad??
GARB
Super crashing bird looks like a furby
"ooh. there's a cornflake in here." 😂
Fun fact: the king chicken is actually kockatorimon, from digimon.
Who called themselves Halalmeat?  You James.  You tried calling yourself Halalmeat.
33:26 I actually saw one of those
I always wonder how he does the comedy bits without people silently judging him or with him embarrassing himself.
Can't wait for Spyro bootlegs.
35:40 is it Peni stone or Penis tone ?
Did anyone know in the 2003 Crash 2 Advance Opening there was Shin Getter Robo?
"Bumwee" is a new term I've never heard before and could have gone my life without instinctually visualizing. Thanks for that lol
5:32 My man really went 👁👄👁
This channel is basically adult blues clues
Cortex: I’m coming
5:53
I Played Super Crashing Bird       It’s Kind Of Fun
31:21 Caught me off gaurd 😂😂😂😂
BANDICONTH
Imagine if some of these got adapted into the actual series the same way Fake Crash did.
Have you ever done any videos for a Mario van look like it in sonic
I’m confused what does it have to do with bootleg
That was weird and I get it
Ew
That’s funny
For like I’m some of these leggings are funny
This sounds weird or than those creepy pastas
That’s funny
I’m surprised you haven’t gone demonetized at
22:25 This is my favorite scene!
Wasn't expecting to watch this video to see Caddy visit the town next to me (Hattersley). Like a glitch in the matrix! P.S. I hope you didn't eat at Mottram Wood because you'll end up with arse gravy of the worst kind 😂
I found a new one on android. Fox island. It’s a side scrolling crash bandicoot. Exactly that.
30:52 This part had me dying.
I love how he sucked spons
When the joke is so funny even caddy laughs at me
The replayability of Caddicarus videos is definitely a factor.
E A T F R U I T
I own a ton of crash bandicoot bootlegs, there everywhere in the gameshops at my home country Idk why but i love collecting them its just good fun i guess lol
Wye valley? Caddy, you are like ten minutes away from me.
1:55
14:47 what my cheez-its see when I take out a couple bags
"call now to receive a toaster for your sandwich"💀😂😂
3:28 “im cuming” “And aparently he did too much, as the planrt is covered in blood” Those 2 sentences made me burst in laugh for 5 hole minutes
1:04 the hell is Conker doing there. Why is he in his war gear with his uzis. What.
1:17 yeah I’m Russian and yeah people were buying these
I have an answer for the why how many bootlegs are on Android: because of Google play doesn't give a damn about the content on their store. It's a huge problem with the policy.
15:50
36:36 Its not a Sweet, Crunchy Salad. Its an M&S Sweet, Crunchy Salad
Nobbly brown thing on a stick. Its not shit!
4:23 now this may be an out-there theory but what if Caddy and Baddy are the same person?!
you weren't missing anything with coco crash adventure rescue: jumming mission, it's literally just crash of the titans psp. again.
8:25 missed opportunity to have a Mr caddy pasta segment
Whoa
Bandicootlegs
27:45  Caddy: What’s the cure for AIDS?  Uka-Uka: I missed the part where that’s my problem.  7:26  Caddy: Ooh! Does this mean that I can get my Bandicoot medium rare?  *inhuman screech from hell*  4:22  Caddy: Now this is the story all about how I caught Ebola and then I died.
28:50 HAHAHA NO.
11:18 I actually know Russian and it translates to: Dr. Cortex kidnaps Crash' girlfriend - Theivna (i think?), so that Crash did his evil plans. (Or something like that, my Russian is pretty rusty, and I'm not really good at translating) Crash refuses and is on his way to save his love... Press Start
Had to rewatch this again, just found the 5yr old sfm, needed to come here to hear the better version... At least you got about better
E A T F R U I T
Bandicunth
7:10 This is hilarious to me
7:10 This part had no reason to make me laugh uncontrollably
That first game that giant chicken is a bloody pixel art of Kokatorimon from Digimon a Cockatrice god this bootlegs will scrounge everywhere for characters to use
Bro is just European 2016 John-Tron and I love it😂
Not the subtle s2k flex
5:15 I *just* realized what this is.  So there's a fighting game called Far East of Eden: Kabuki Klash where the victory screen has the loser in an overdramatic spotlight as confetti falls. After a mirror match, the loser turns out to be a tanuki in disguise. So the lump on that game over screen is that tanuki...which just raises more questions.
The first world of “Crash Advance 4”  The name: “Dreamlike Watercity” The environment: A desert  Seems legit
2:38 the “a machine” might mean “the product is fit for gameboy colour/advance machine”
I desperately want to know what Door Door is
The Halalmeat bit gets me everytime 🤣
lol
You can really feel Caddy padding in this video because he just didn’t have enough to talk about here. Give the man more bootlegs!
For those wondering what is actually written at 11:24 Doctor Cortex kidnaps Crash's girlfriend Tawna so that Crash will do his evil deeds. Crash refuses and goes to save his beloved
I'm a brazilian and I can confirm that you'll find Karotos *EVERYWHERE!* Along with the Polystations.
4:48 7:30 16:50 21:09  IDK Why, But This Was So Funny.
5:32 Most iconic moment for Caddy ever, I think I replied that part like a 1000 times :D:D:D
8:17 "And why is that?" "YOUR MOM!" kills me. It's the perfect response you'll ever get for getting answers from a crappy bootleg.  12:44 I love the quick shot of Crash somehow turning upside down.
Is Cockatricemon on a throne
3:41 GETTER ROBO RULES EVERYTHING, IT IS WHAT THE STORIES HAVE FORETOLD (That's literally Shin Getter Robo wtf?)
Certified Eat fruit! moment
26:24 this man cannot escape crash of the titans
I love your content, Daddy Caddy. But I know a good game when I see one. Let's see a YouTube short on train station 2. 💕
0:23  Favorite line of this entire video
18:52 me when i see NSFW pizza tower fanart
28:47 Twin Peaks: The Return
It’s bandicunth
Imagine seeing crash trying to hop over the fence
32:13 very funny
TWEET TWEET
5:30 seeing caddi and ollie laughing together makes me smile 😁
I'm glad this video taught people that yes, in the UK, we actually have roadsigns that refer to anything north of London as 'The North' like its some forbidden realm. Also yes, it is literally anything north of London. If your below London, motorway signs will likely say 'London' when your heading north, the moment your 1cm above london, its just 'The North'
Before Putin poed in a tin got me out
I had another console that had the crash bandicoot from The Family Carroto. I had played that shit on a copy of The Game boy advance.
A puerto rican friend of mine calls C. Bandicoot “Cass Mañoco”
Is no one gonna talk about how one of the Crash Bootlegs on the gameboy has an image of Shin Getter Robo?
Cash banooka bootlegs are cursed
I like the sponsor this time
I saw this video a lot of times, but I never have seen that someone even tried to translate the russian text in Sega crash game, so i'll take a jab at it.  "Doctor Cortex kidnaps Tawna - Crash's girlfriend (misspelled as Taiwna here for some reason) to force Crash to do his evil bidding. Crash refuses and is going to save his love". I tried translating it as close as I could to the text, but if you have any suggestions on what I should change or just say something funny, I think everyone wouldn't be against it.
I still can't believe half the stuff Caddie does. Mans a legend.
how has it been a year since this video
3:27 - that's not a portal, that's a shitty screenshot of Shin Getter doing the Stoner Sunshine attack in Super Robot Wars Alpha Gaiden!
1:57
Woah, that's crazy! I recently just started re-collecting ReSaurus figures too, however I'm collecting the figures from the Sonic Adventure 1 collection!
With great power comes spons
24:05  I miss the Roblox “oof” noise…
That’s funny
Its been a few years since i saw a Caddy video and wow hes sure chabged a lot
Somehow I missed this video 😅 but yes Every month is candicoot!!!! 😂 wooooo!❤      17.7.23
Caddy are you ok?
I'm starting to notice the constant children aggression jokes If they on in on all this madness then I guess the insanity must run in the -country- family lmao
27:46 based
CADDY BANDICOOT MONTH 2023 ALREADY PASSED LIKE 22 DAYS AGO, WHERE THE HELL IS THE NEXT CASH BANOOCA VIDEO!?
any one notice the finaal dom
How do you make these videos go from slightly serious to a complete fever dream.
BREAKING NEWS: Caddy has failed to make bandicoot month 2023 edition!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Stay put as we wait for further details
He has a cameraman???
3:26 Why is this so funny to me
5:34 I never thought I would see Caddy laugh. It's the most beatifull laugh.
Gotta say Caddi, you handled those heels well.  I probably would have broke my ankles.  Lol
Caddicarus is basically a Monty Python of video games with surreal humor and I'm into it
Is that Kokatorimon in 3:56 ?
Caddicarus is basically a preschool show for adults where we have an eccentric host covering interesting topics and is joined by other ungodly beings.
Brazilian crash hits different
Caddy did you hear what happened? Unfortunately the original voice for crash passed away.
26:46 wesquerianwerewrewereawawawawaW
.A A A  Q 0:36 0:37
I think Caddy broke the reviews for that Zombies Run app. Look up "Zombies Run - zombie hunter" (the app's new name); the game's got a bunch of reviews now, and basically all of them are parodies of Caddy's.
Just this 14:42
Consider this my attempt at showing my support for you, your work and this vid in particular. Thanks for keeping us all entertained!
CASH BANUKA
6:41 The policemen
Here's what the Text says about Crash Bandicoot Mega Drive at the Start of the Game.   Dr. Neo Cortex kidnaps Kresh's (which is ment by Crash) girlfriend, Teana (Which is ment by Tawna), in order for Kresh to fulfill his sinister plan.  Kresh - refuses and goes to save his beloved... Press Start
“But if you couldn’t tell, I’m not Chinese, I’m caddy.” @ 1:41 is such a sincere and kind line. It warms my cold damp heart. 😊
caddy really just sounds like Weird Al Yankovic at 6:18!
36:49
if you kill Spons at Spon Lane... Is it considered SPONKILLING?!
Remember, if you are having a bad day or having a hard time, there is always a solution...   *Eat fruits!*
Who is here after olly ross has found the cash bandiloot machine?
34:42 me, an american: so its just a normal short trip?
Door Door is a freaking classic!! It’s a piece of industry history!  🚪🚪
30:49-30:56 has got to be my favorite caddy moment ever!😂
Yes, the most violent, no window crash bandicoot villain, the salamander
7:27
Looks like an inverted wumpa fruit..?
There is 1 more crash bootleg and it's called m&m shell shocked
Jreasures
I don’t know what’s funnier. Caddy going to such extreme lengths to find a single obscure gambling machine, or the fact that someone else decided to randomly call themselves “Halalmeat”.  RIGHT ANSWER: “Eat fruit!”
No not that one  no not that one  that’s is not a phone   There we go
i dont know if it was on sale when this video dropped, but i believe you can just buy the gambling machine online
19:00 crashes daughter looks interesting
29:34 he turned into a trumpet
16:16 the hand sounds like hasan kadair
Cash banooca time
Yo I managed to get crush bandi to run for like 10 seconds using a top of the line android phone. but it still crashes so I think it's bugged
You know that a caddicarus video is short when it is not 1h+
15:51
🇪🇸🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇳🇺🇳🇿🇲🇸🇫🇰🇪🇷🇪🇪🇫🇴
Grateful sponsibilities
Everytime I see somebody in Europe complain about a three-hour car ride it makes me laugh
I'm very disappointed Caddy didn't call himself "Daddicarus" when he got in the car
SNOIK
29:18 I wonder how long it took Caddy to come up with this joke.
I CANT BELIEVE HE PLAYED CRAZY FOX ADVENTURE BUT NOT BOB THE PENGUIN
The Chicken king is the Digimon Kokatorimon
T H E  N O R T H
I wanna believe that who ever chose the name “Halalmeat” is another caddy from an alternate universe. Perhaps he created that game called Krash bandi.
11:26 “DOCTOR CORTEKS KIDNAPPES THE CREAM GIRL - THEIONI,  in order for the cream to fill HIS ELOVIE” The part that got me wasn’t just how unintentionally dirty it sounds, but also the fact that it somehow rhymes
22:42 That had me wheezing. And when the Banana was thrown at him i was wondering why tf she threw a Banana of all things, then i remembered, Ring Ring Ring Ring Ring Ring! BANANA PHONE!
16:43 here we go- never mind he was getting his phone
6:20 this part killed me. GG
I've never heard of this KARAOTO CONSOLE here in Brazil. Searching on google I realized that it must be from another place in Latin America considering that most of the information about it is in Spanish. Here in Brazil one that still became popular was the Polystation during the early 2000s.
25:46 had me DYING
Your humor just gets me
Third time watching this video and it makes me laugh, every, single, time!! The bit with his hands is just so funny 16:14
8:14 THE BIRD JUST GETS FUCKIN PUNTED TO THE OTHER END OF THE EARTH LMAO
That's another thing, Jim - apparently these dogs are recolored sprites from a Japanese-only licensed game called The Third-Eyed One.
This channel's humor is like if cocaine, sugar, bad memes, good memes, and my dad had a baby.
Wait, cockneys are also called "cocks?" Oh, I am SO getting in trouble later, I don't even care if that's not the case, I'm running with it.
The original Halalmeat will always be an enigma.
Cadies
curious if the crash bandicoot dev made anymore games
Plot twist: It was the wrong bar all along.
28:47 funniest scene to me
11:25
I know this video is old. But being someone from THE NORTH... Yeah Caddy has every reason to be afraid.
Damn they really stole the Pokemon A press sound for their Wumpa fruit collection sound huh
I think all of the bootlegs on iOS have been delisted, can’t find any of them on the App Store
excuse me patrick woodruff how on earth did you manage to get the idea of questioning such thing😭
8:45 G A R B
Can we just appreciate that Caddy drove a billion miles for a knock off Crash lottery machine
16:16 is quite possibly my favorite little skit from Caddy and that says a lot. It makes me laugh every single time, especially at the end.
5:28
18:52 When I see NSFW Fnaf fan art.
12:33 "WHOA!"
23:43
Im surprised you didnt find the "Family Karaoto", this kind of bootleg NES here in Brazil were really common back in the day, and that Crash game isint exclusive to that console as well
3:24 somehow getter robo Armageddon is now in the same universe as crash bandicoot.
The most british birds I ever heard

I can't stop laughing at 14:04 DOOR DOOR
So is Antdude just Crash’s official voice now?
Wow, I jump, just like Crash, BANDI!
Why am I so attracted to this man 💀
Thats a kokatorimon. I love when a random digimon appears in my crash bandicoot game.
The story about the Cash Bandiloot machine is about the saddest thing I’ve ever heard from you. My condolences, caddy.
In the first game the "chicken" seems to be a Cockatorimon from Digimon and the enemies from that game iirc are from Mitsume Ga Tooru for the NES.
25:46 the way it just crashes in the first second 🤣🤣🤣
Crash Bandicoot for the NES is actually not Brazilian by origin, it's made by Nice Code, a company from China.
Have you tried looking for browser games?
19:36: Why does Crash Bandicoot keep wanting me to play Train Station 2?🤨
I need someone to make an hour long loop of "...inside this sad old man..."
the intro is even funnier once you learn about the earlier take (unfortunately not recorded) where caddy scared a mother and her baby by jumping over a fence while wearing a shitty crash bandicoot costume
✌️
GUYS I found a cornflakes in here
7:27 I can’t tell if that’s edited or if he really set a crash plush on fire just for that bit.
Now this is a story, all about how I caught Ebola and then I died

The editing on this video is really good 👍
8:18 personal use.

One of your best and most hillarious videos. So many quality jokes and the fact that you went to Manchester to find a bootleg arcade game shows true dedication.
"I'm not chinese... I'm Caddy" is one of the truest things a British person has ever said
1:54
“humty dumpty with a shotgun” got me rolling on the floor
I still love the bit where one of his daughters pelts phones at him.
WHO CALLED THEMSELVES HALAL MEAT
four guys?? YouTube’s chapters suck lmao
Crash bandibootleg
17:10 huh no wonder crash doesn't talk his grammar is sh!t-
32:12 my favorite joke in this entire video
7:29
Avengers Infinity War is the most ambitious crossover. 30:48: Well yes but actually no.
Here's what the text at 11:19 actually says: DOCTOR CORTEX KIDNAPPES CRASH'S GIRL - TEIVNA, IN ORDER TO FULFILL CRASH'S EVIL PLAN. CRASH - REFUSES AND GOES TO SAVE HIS BELOVED... PRESS START
I would love to know what your neighbours think when you are filming.
That Jumming mission game is port of titans
34:51 omg my friend worked in the pub where they had that crash bandicoot slot machine.
"Hey, lady, can I have your number?  so I can ring you and tell you how _vile_ you are?" Look, _someone's_ probably drawn porn of it by now
5:32 I can't stop giggling and I love how caddi and his camera man lost it
7:12 The Binding of Isaac
Sintax is a thing in coding, its the way the code is writen out. Like var x = 12;

5:30 this is my new favorite joke. I laughed for hours
0:19 bandicoot!
Oh we have the same printer. I have to print wireless with it.  I hold a loaded nerf gun next to it just in case.
This video had me dying of laughter 😂
the policemen 6:41
antdude being the voice of crash is one of my favorite running gags of his
In “2003 crash advance 2” you can’t exit the level. I guess CORMBEX will forever keep conquering EARTHMFS.8
those karaoto consoles where renamed "Polystation"
Hey did you know that there is a crash manga
Brazil Mentioned 🥳🥳🥳
I played the Brazilian copy of the game but it was on a game boy type device,and also all the sound effects were high pitch.

9:04
“Dr. Cortex kidnappes the cream girl - Theoni, in order for the Cream to fill his elovie”  Never before has a better plot been written
8:43 "it controls like GARB"
Just wait until the possibility of bootleg Spyro games, where Spyro uses an uzi.

9:04  spons!
32:12 caddy and baby favorite part mine, bootleg language
What’s the name of the at 28:00
13:49 me when I’m sorry but I’m not sure if it’s too late
The text at 11:19 essentially states that Cortex kidnapped Crash's GF so that crash would enact Cortex's horrible plans (presumably to negotiate her back from Cortex), but Crash refuses and goes out to save her.
11:19 Doctor Cortex kidnaps Crash's girlfriend - Teiwna (that's how written there), so Crash would carry out his sinister design (I'm not sure that it's really correct, I'd rather say plan)  Crash refuses and goes to save his beloved  Press start
I have to wonder: what's next?  Let's face it, Caddy has done pretty much every Crash game he could and we have reached a point where materials for Crash video is starting to run dry.  It was already a mistake to do a Crash Bandicoot month given how it doesn't have as many games and other stuff compared Mario and Sonic along with how he has done a good chunk of the games at that point but once he changed his review style into long videos of many games he ended up accelerating the process of reviewing Crash games by a long shot. Not helping is that he did Crash 4: It's About Time in NOVEMBER of all months instead of saving it for Bandicoot Month that would have prolonged it.  So i do wonder what comes next since I have NO idea what type of Crash material Caddy can do outside of his streams on his other channel.
I honestly believe Crash himself was capable of developing Crash Fox
Lmfao every single time I see him put those glasses on then look up at the camera it kills me 😂🤣😂🤣😂☠️
nice intro
I love Caddy!
those glasses he had 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
5:32 That was too much. 🤣
the hand with googly eyes caught me off guard so well
Yeah I tried the Crash Tiki's Choice App myself. Didn't find it very helpful either.  Me: What is the one true religion? Aku: Eat fruit! Me: What is the meaning of life? Aku: Eat fruit! Me: Is it possible the turn lead into gold? Aku: Anything is possible if you try! Me: How many Essex girls does it take to change a lightbulb? Aku: Eat fruit! Me: What would be an appropriate opening line for my Martin Luther King Jr. Day speech? Aku: Ooga booga!
I love how this time he is just done with Spon's nonsense
"and I think he did too much cause now the earth is covered in blood" . My childhood story

the "oh no, my queen" line hits a lot harder these days
12:33 I'm embarrassed to say that scared me
The fact that android keeps games on their App Store that DONT work angers me so much  LIKE GET RID OF IT IF THE PERSON THAT MADE IT IS NOT GONNA FIX IT
25:14 he reached Shawn the sheep a home

The waffle house has found it's new host
Spons I love you because you actually give a genuine opinion
"what is the cure for aids" "that's not my problem" that is still one of the funniest bits in this entire video mostly because that would totally be an uka uka thing to say lolololololol
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 gee cross and hattersley. Greater Manchester. Pricelsss
2:52 bro that's the animation of a Dragonball attack lmao 4:00 that chicken is from Digimon xD
I enjoy your comedy. That cutaway of you with the fork choked me
8:37
6:07 I didn't know caddy was the Vacuum from Teletubbies 🤣🤣
The funny thing is I'm from Texas and going 6 hours round trip to do anything round here is actually considered quite normal. A long day trip even.
14:59 it’s the flint stones game but crash bandicoot so basically grand dad but crash bandicoot.
25:55 guess you could call it...CRASH bandicoot.....i'll see myself out...
7:30 You know next time you burn a crash bandicoot plush you don’t really have to. You can just send him to me. I will give him a good home. Please stop burning plushes.
B A N D I C U N T H
THE NOOOOOORRRRRTH!
I hope Caddy enjoyed The NORTH
Only caddy would be the person who gets excited over a voucher from Tesco.
the way Caddy says policemen (POOLISMIN) is my new aesthetic
21:10
22:14   The halalmeat in question: well of course I know him. He is me
I know it is too late, but a google search of the machine led to a few sites in which to purchase it second hand. Not sure how trustworthy they are, but if you ever wanted to buy it, it CAN still be an option. Though it this point it would just be to avenge that wasted trip.😅
19:50 had me dying of laughter for some reason
Caddy: im not chinese im caddy Me:I thought you were british
34:46 that sounds...semi reasonable drive granted from America so
LMAOOO! Bootleg games are always a riot! Great, funny vid, as always! <3
One time I found an entire port of crash 2 on the Google play store but it looked the Google play store photos looked fake. I downloaded it and it was the actual thing
I looked up Caddy’s review on the Zombies Run game and somehow his rating got changed to five stars and the game is now called Zombies Run- zombie hunter. Guess too many Crash Bandicoot fans were leaving reviews 😂
this wasn't crash bandicoot this was accident hyena
they used to many c so there name had to use a j
5:32 Caddy looks like Marty Feldman with those glasses! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Who has heard of the recently revealed crash team rumble
Not gunna lie I forgot the joke now isn't that ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff BANDICONTH
my man can't read
Crash II Advance...on the Game Boy Color?  And they used the Pokemon text sound to represent gem collecting?
Question: Who called their nickname: "Halalmeat"?
I go to a pub where theres a Cash Bandicoot machine, it’s called The Pilgrim and its in Liverpool
"As you can see here, the UK has more pubs than blades of grass"  Yeah, that about sums up the UK in a nutshell. Made me laugh harder than it should have
I saw a video about a 300 in 1 cartridge for the NES (I think?) that had a Crash Bandicoot ripoff that was just Disney's The Jungle Book but with a horrible Crash instead of Mowgli. It had great things like "Crash heads out to look for the Man Village" It was on an episode of Rerez's series looking at horrible consoles
8:18 YA MUM
That king chicken is actually a real digimon btw if anyone was wondering what that was in the beginning. Forget it’s name tho.
31:25 every british man and woman on 9/8/2022
i like how in the gba one every time you collect a wumpa fruit it plays the menu select sound effect from the game boy pokemon games
THE COLLECTING NOISE FROM CRASH ADVANCE 4 IS THE POKEMON MENU NOISE.
19:39 Crash the bandicoot engine
And it's called a Zebra "Zeebra" not a Zed-bra.
Bandiloot is purchasable now
You know with how much he makes jokes about it, it may as well be bandiconth.
you earned the like for the dedication and literal drive. good job love the videos!
Gbc/a machine means Gameboy color/advanced. The latter was backcompat with GBC games
8:44 garb sound close to carp 25:37 yeah, we all get like that.
Please keep doing this sort of thing❤️
I feel for you (the trip)
1:39 it must be fun to be his neighbor.
Craig bandaid
Mate, your humour is right on point nonsense that literally makes me lol. Keep up the great work 😁
EAT FRUIT! that part never fails to make me laugh
4:23
5:32  where can I get myself one of those glasses? and what are they called? I want one
22:08
Glad to see that Caddy owns Final DooM
20:09 At first when he said "Zombies Run" I thought he was talking about the genuinely high-quality audiobook/workout app of the same name (which is basically an app to encourage you to go on on a run that has stories where you're the main character in a zombie apocalypse which you can only play if you're running/moving around).  I was very confused. But then quickly reassured when i saw it was something completely different lmao
Suprise cameo by the Shin Getter 1 from Getter Robo Armageddon at 3:26 and 3:42
2003 crash 2 advanced the beginning music is literally from Howl's Moving Castle a Studio Ghibli film with amazing music a good story and some funny things and what does that have to do with Crash Bandicoot a giant Moving Castle that looks like a toad doesn't have anything to do with a Bandicoot that collects apple fruit things and Spins like a top
7:27
I did a more recent translation on the Zero the Kamikaze Russian text  I managed to gather "Doctor Corteks kidnaps the kpewa girl, Teyvnu in order to make cream perform his purpose. Skinny Kpew refuses and goes to save his beloved...  Press Start"
ADHD summarised in one video
As uncle Ben always said 'with great power comes great bootys'
My fish died today... and you cheered me up Caddy. Thanks for being the best.
4:00 Pretty sure that Chicken is a Digimon.
"Who call themself halalmeat?" For one, you. 🤣
I'm watching this video in 2.0x speed.
Can’t help but love that caddy got so close to me, dude was in Barnsley EVEN SHOWED A SIGN THAT SAID WAKEY AND WENT TO A SERVICE STATION I WENT TO MULTIPLE TIMES plus a hotel which I’ve been to like 2-3 times when going abroad 😂😂
Congratulations on 1 mil subs!!!!
Eat fruit!
Yay! The barrel from his behind the scenes video that he uploaded after this one actually DID once have a purpose. Yay!
Na man he wants ur liver
*_B A N D I C O N T H_*
I am now in the process of ripping the Super Crashing Bird model from the game so I can rig it up to use in VRChat and NO ONE CAN STOP ME!
Jook Nookem?

Spons.exe
11:33-11:37. That must have hurt! But it’s so damn funny and stupid! ❤😂
24:07 For those who are wondering, that 'oof' wasn't an edit by Caddy. That was actually in the game.
you know i just realized. 35:00 CADDY OWNS A MUSTANG?!? if you don't call it the Cadstang imma be mad Side note: he probably rented it for the drive but calling it the Cadstang is still funny to me Another edit: NOPE, IT IS HIS, CALL IT THE GOSH DARN CADSTANG
favorite parts 28:44 27:20
You are getting funnier with every video I watch! XD
How many times have you killed you’re daughter in you’re videos and I wonder what she said after you told her to throw phones and some foam at you for a video
25:00 Great.. The music is mine. Made that in FL studio years ago for fun. Didn't have a clue that someone put it in that horrible abomination as a background music. I have the full length track on my channel, I guarantee it's better than the "game".
POV: when you have a baby in Ohio 32:12
That zombie game with the car sounds like more of a rip off of zombie highway than a crash bandicoot game I love zombie highway and I'm pissed off that it's off the store just like real scary spiders and the older and much better beat your boss
What if the gun isn't a "Gun" Gun but a Woompa Bazooka from the 3rd game... I mean think about it 🤔
i was confused at first how she was recording him then remembered that they have left side drive
They're not mangos or apples They're Wompafruit
3:58 ...Kokatorimon?
Please do a mario bootleg video!😅
6:18
7:57
13:11 alguém chamou? ouvi Brasil... Esse aí eu não conheço, mas aqui existe um tal de Polystation, que é um famicon disfarçado, igual esse, mas o nome Polystation é mais conhecido, enganou muitos pais kkkk
23:43 is by far the most hilarious part of this video. I sure do love the taste of couch fluff!
22:50This is like, the second time he's killed her
“WHO CALLED THEMSELVES HALALMEAT?!” I spotted “Magic Mushrooms” in the always crashing game and I think the devs were on that when they made it
Love you Caddy ! Have done for years ! Your videos are simply amazing ! All the best dude !
Pikmin music?!
"OOOO! Is that a cornflake?"🤣🤣🤣🤣👍
"Before putin..... pooed in a tin."🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👍
So Caddi drives a Mustang.. Baddy Caddy !
I've been thinking about it, and I think the GBC Huge Adventure which said "For Game Boy Color/A machine, really meant "For Game Boy Color or Game Boy Advanced machine
4:17 *Now This A Story All About How I Caught Ebola And Then I Die :D*
bandicunth
Hey everyone how are you trick question I don’t care had be absolutely dieting or laphter
15:38 I find it funny that those issues appear in this game because they normally only appear in NES games where the camera can move diagonally. Those graphical issues on the right edge are the result of the game I think de-loading tiles as the camera moves away from them, or maybe they're just being moved to where they'll be used next, I don't know what the game is actually doing with those tiles. What's important is that basically every game with scrolling of any kind on the system, and likely most 8 and 16-bit systems for that matter, does this, but you don't see it in games like the original Super Mario Bros. or Metroid because they use an offscreen buffer to push it beyond the viewable area.   However, the NES is only capable of applying this to one axis at a time; that obviously isn't a problem for a game like SMB1 that only ever scrolls on one axis anyway, and while Metroid does scroll on both axes, it never does so at the same time, so the game can move the offscreen buffer to where it needs to be for that specific room. However, games like Super Mario Bros. 3 and Kirby's Adventure can scroll diagonally, which means that the game is now scrolling on both axes, if it wasn't obvious. Since you can't apply the offscreen buffer to both axes, the programmers had to choose one to apply it to.  TL;DR: Those graphical issues on the edge of the screen usually only appear on NES games with diagonal scrolling since the system can apply an offscreen buffer to one axis at a time. The Reason I find it funny that these issues exist in this game is that judging by the footage, it doesn't even appear to scroll vertically at all, only horizontal; if this is true, then that means they most likely didn't apply an offscreen buffer at all.
9:09 Your vaccum cleaner looks like a steam punk rifle💀
Never expected to see Shin Getter 1 in a video about Crash Bandicoot bootlegs. That made my day lol.
Caddicarus is basically a preschool show for adults where we have an eccentric host covering interesting topics and is joined by other ungodly beings.
the first mobile game does seem about the quality a game crash bandicoot himself would make
9:05 yes you are.
His house is basically an scp entry
8:25 well that's me not sleeping for a week.
I think that "king chicken" is actually a stolen digimon design. Kokatorimon to be specific. I guess it makes sense that they'd be willing to bootleg from multiple sources.
Is no one going to talk about the new intro? It's fully CGI which I think is really cool. I just wanted to mention that. 😒
8:43 Personal garb button
I have the same sandwich press
my problem uka uka its you 27:48
24:32 Yes I can, it's the warrant for your arrest
Your what?  31:25
11:26 WHAT!?
For some reason now I feel very nostalgic about times when such bootlegs of popular game francises were everywhere in my country  Also if someone wants to know what is really written in 11:19, here is the translation:  Doctor Cortex steals Crash's girlfriend Tawna("Tawna" is translated incorrectly and is pronounced like Teiwna") so Crash would carry out his sinister plan. Crash refuses to do it and goes to save his lover...  And "press start" at the bottom of the screen
The real Bandiloot are the ones we do along the way.
BANDILOOOT
Does anyone else think that when Crash is walking in the boots, it looks a bit like a GTA 5 mod
“Sir, we are destroying earth, what is your final speech?” “I’m coming!~”
@Caddicarus I wanna know what went through your head when you made the "give me 5" joke at 7:57
Best way to advertise a product ever 21:37

16:16 Thank you, Daddy Caddy!

Oh my God, the first game was like Crash Bumpkinoot.
Jon tron but tall
Caddy really looks like Markiplier in this video
Lmao 6 hour round trip, that is 2 days of me going to work and back. I love how much the size difference is between you and the US
18:52 after finding this part this has been my favorite scene from a caddy video
As an American, the funniest part of this video was Caddy being so intimidated at the thought of a 3-hour drive.
I kinda want to know about SpongeBob SquarePants vs Crash Bandicoot
8:18 11:32 6:41
Epicko!
I don’t like BALLOOINS I like BALLOOANS!
That “where’s squidward” line with a picture of red mist makes me upset.
What does this have to do with fall guys ? It says #fallguys in the description
29:32 That’s it, this is officially the greatest dad joke I’ve ever heard.
WHO CALLED THEMSELVE HALAL MEAT?
15:05 Aww this version of him is cute. He looks like a baby bandicoot.
Glad I'm not the only one who gets a laugh out of those THE NORTH road signs. It's almost like a warning, are you sure you want to go to THE NORTH?
3:27 that's not neo cortex. That's shin getter 1 from super robot wars alpha 3.
3:44 is that Justice from Guilty Gear?
He is Underrated as heck.
"I'm not chinese, I'm Caddy"  Why the hell I laughed at this?
Caddy contributing to global warming by driving 3 hours to find a cash bandiloot gambling machine
WTF
The one bootleg that doesn't have Crash in its name..and what does it do when you try to load it up?
*E A T* *F R U I T*                             *That's not my problem*
I hate that he makes a tuba joke and then points the camera at a euphonium. So Caddie

CADDY IVE FOUND THE GAMBLING MACHINE. IVE SENT YOU A DM ON INSTAGRAM. ITS IN LIVERPOOL.
Is nobody gonna mention the compressed Shin Getter at 3:40
5:32 just SCREAMS "do you have games on your phone" to me
The first games devs made their name Sintax likely bc of Syntax
btw the bird in the first game is a digimon called Cockatrimon
hi can I make a reaction video to this
You should play Bootleg Mario Games.
22:30 is it just me or does Caddi look hella sunburnt from his face to neck?
The sad thing is... I managed to find Zombies Run on the app store. They've changed it from Crash Bandicoot to Zombie Defense though, I wonder why.... 🤔
Caddy: I drove 6 hours Me in the Midwest: *sips drink* Let me tell you about driving to Texas-
I died at crash changing races and halalmeat
4:22 7:58 8:44 11:02
29:44 I'm pretty sure it's because putting a game on andriod is dirt cheap, like a 20 dollar payment before you're allowed to put any games up. As opposed to iPhone with something ridiculous like 100-300 dollars a year.
The baby pants made me laugh so much
6:18
10:35
The coco game is just crash of the titens
I'm so happy it finally seems like you get the views and likes you deserve. I used to watch you in the early to mid 2010's along with the normal boots guys. And I always felt you were right up there with jontron and pbg in entertainment value, but it seemed like you just wouldn't get as much attention. Now you are, and it's about time. This format definitely seems to be working for you.
I still can't believe Caddy was a few streets away from me at one point. I live in Glossop, one of the places he drive through. The photo at the Glossop sign is genuinely a few streets away from me
31:26 when the queen finally kicks the bucket.
Caddy should do Crash fan games.
i like caddicaruses channle but my problem is that the videos take so long to make but i love his videos
And now i have to play coco andvinchers
I played crash badacoot fox adventure  and the enemy's are just beavers and i saved a demon baby and it somend fire to kill the bevers and the bevers go to heven and it has physics  and you trow the frut at the bevers
I actually love these animations, they are so unique and adorable. I’m honestly a huge fan!
4:23 without a doubt your funniest moment ever
DID CORTEX BUILD SHIN GETTER ROBO?!?!? HOLY SHIT CASH IS FUCKED
27:24 eat fruit
Mountain
As someone in a Crash Bandi Roblox Game said "Великий Мужественный и лучший танцор Bandi!"
There’s a Peppa Pig attend a switch game Tendo
6:22 I felt that
Griffin McElroy, in my Caddy?
Caddy we need more bootleg series!!!
He GOT 1 MILLION!
The cops are coming
IAN HERE!!! 26:46 That was the most funniest thing that I could ever seen in a Crash bandicoot game ever!!!
31:27 that didn’t age well
My local pub has a cash bandiloot- Swindon
"The sun is out." Oh, if we only knew. XD
16:16 will forever live in my head rent free.
Pretty sure the music for Crash Fox is stolen, too.
Turn the new Peppa Pig game on the tendo switch
11:19 Translate: "Doctor Cortex kidnaps Crash's girlfriend Tawna in order for Crash to carry out his evil plan. Crash refuses and goes to rescue his beloved" If anyone is interested. Funny that they writed her name like "Téyvna"
7:13 Crash turns into Isaac

In some moments your brain just disappeared
Don't mind me, just saving this for myself  13:49
Including those tweets in the sponsor is a big nuts move
I keep thinking what people think when they see you do crazy shit
"Oh my queen!" That... aged...
The dedication of this man to find some things is really worth all my respect !
"Oh no, my Queen!"
caddy was talking about "having a good birthday present" when i realized this video was uploaded on my birthday

Idk why but whenever you say policemen its funny
i think the reason some of the android games didnt work is cuz your android phone was a cheap low budget crap phone
Cash Landiloot LOL
What’s the name of the crazy music from 39:00 it’s hilarious 😆
as a brazillian i can confirm i have never heard of the karaoto console before
Caddy didn’t play bandicoot buddy uwu…. Or did he?
Sometimes I’m wondering what the win margin of caddy’s videos are. He destroys so much stuff in each one of them…
*CASH BAZOOKA*
When will you find cash bandiloot?
I know exactly where the Cash Bandiloot machine is in Manchester!  It’s in a pub called the Millstone in Northern Quarter.  I did the plumbing for the building.
31:27 oh no, his queen
That "oh no my queen." bit really did not age well.
That intro is slick ngl
His American accent is scary good
calling it bum-wee has somehow made diarrhea even nastier. Good job??
Cash Bonuca. Exe
11:00 i like bloons
Another amazing upload!!
31:20 all of Britain right now
31:25 Topical
At 11:19 it says Doctor Cortex kidnaps Crash's girl so that you Crash can fulfill his sinister plan,  Crash - refuses and goes to save his beloved  press start
15:41 this is nes limatio not bad coding smb.3 has it too
3:54 Is… is that a Digimon?  It is. That’s a Kokatorimon. Why is that a Kokatorimon?
The fruit isn't actually a apple it's a fictional fruit called a "Whumpa Fruit"
Yes.
Yeah Crash Fox definitely seems like it was made by Crash
3:27 Cotex: i 'm Comminq  Great dialogue

I did some thinking on the title and came up with such a terrible name I'd be surprised if you used it.  Candimonth. Like Caddicarus, bandicoot and month together.
3:54 Cash Banooka and King COCKatorimom!!!

I have a random question, I noticed during the road trip that you have a mustang. Is that the Mach E. I know its not related but bit of a car fan and was curious
Nice
Consume ripened ovaries of flowering plants.
Reminds me of how I walked half way across the Isle of Wight in the sun to see a laundrette
35:41 you were in penistone? Omg I live in penistone. This is an amazing day!!
3:22 oh no
What is the music used at 14:45 from?.

1:34 I want to find this Crash vs SpongeBob bootleg out of morbid curiosity
"I'll start hissing and pissin" literally the funniest thibg ever
One of the pictures in the intro the crash 2 gbc is a screengrab of Shin Getter Robo from the anime OVA Shin Getter Robo Armageddon. Do what this information what you will.
5:20 no comment
Eat  fruit
How did Caddy go 10+ years without gracing us with the presence of Cod-dy. That's just preposterous.
You remained me of that one guy who makes spongebob theories 😂
I know there's at least one person in this world who is still wondering what was going on when he seen Caddy dressed as Crash with the leather boots on and that makes me so happy lol 😊
My bootlegs 1:37

wow thanks dj mouth
5:44 crash looks like a drunk Finnish man Who is going hunting
YOU GOT 1M SUB
Hes done it ladies and gentlemen. He has reached 1 million. SPYRO GAMES HERE WE COME.
@3:52 King Chicken is actually  A sprite of a Digimon called Cockatrimon, but I wouldn't expect caddy to catch that because cockatrimon would need a champion level COCK to stand out
16:50 where is this laugh from
5:31 XD  8:26 XD  9:04 *spons*  11:26 *XD*  13:59 Mario, Kirby, Mega Man, Alien 3, *NUTS MILK, ARABIAN & DOOR DOOR.*

You made it to 1M subs, congratulations mate!

#stansphraseoftheday Stan is god cause dog is god backwards

12:33 I cant believe they got the real Collin in this video
He's finally at 1 million
24:07 roblox death sound
15:30 reopened the video here
For anyone wondering, "Coco Crash Adventure Rescue" is just Crash of the Titans... again. So, I guess Caddy dodged a bullet by that game not working.
Imagine the current owner of the gambling machine watched this video....
Cadds, make a Nintendo Switch accesories video. I found some good and bad accesories. It’ll make your scalp melt and kick your family and your dog.
35:39 cool german flag
Door Door's kinda good, though.
Imagine caddy gets murdered for dissing Putin
Genuinely love these videos so much. Thank you Caddy for the years of entertainment and laughter.
Happy congratulations on 1m subs!!
1 million subscribers: Time to start the Spyro reviews
3:44 Did... did cortex just turn into Getter Robo? I wasn't sure at first as it's so pixelated, but yeah, that's pretty clearly Shin Getter 1. Shame it doesn't work as I really want to see where that game is going now. Wait. Cortex's plan in the first game was artificially evolving animals. Was he doing Getter Ray experiments this entire time?! As dumb as it is, this twist actually makes sense to me.
1 MILLION SUBS
Caddy it’s time for that Spyro 2 review
What’s wrong with his ear lobes
former sub checking in. time for spyro owowowowowowowowowowowo

Caddy Are you aware that your sub count is at 999k
Almost 1million subs lets get it :)
That's actually russian for: "Doctor Cortex kidnapps Crash's girlfriend-Tayvna to make crash fullfill his evil desires. Crash refuses and sets off to save his beloved. Press start" They really fukt up on Tawna but the grammar is mostly fine.
Hi Caddicarus, I’ve found a cash bandiloot machine at a Wetherspoons in central London. It’s at the Goodman’s Field in Whitechapel. I have a photo too!
I give it less than 48 hours before that subscriber count hits seven digits! Let's go!
13:49 Is iT tOo lAte nOw tO saY sOoorryYýYY!?
I wonder if Cad would do a review on RE3 Remake, Village or kinda do a remake of his older re reviews before RE7
bro he's gonna have a milion subs
1… more…. Thousand… subs…
Algum br por aqui?
Crash bandicoot medium rare
It is August 20 2022, and Caddy now has 999k subscribers. The long awaited Spyro video is finally about to be released upon the world. The day I've been waiting for for years is finally about to happen.
So aparently i instaled and opend The app "crash bandi:Fox adventure *corect speeling*" and somehow it worked so caddy just buy a huawei
GUYS CADDY IS ALMOST TO ONE MILLION SUBSANDWITCHES!!!!!   DUDEEEE IM EXITED I'VE WATCHED THIS LEGEND SINCE I WAS HOMELESS!!!  GET HIM TO THE ONE MIL CLUB IM IN TEARS HES ALMOST THERE!!!  HE'S ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY MY NUMBER ONE FAVORITE YOUTUBER!!  YAYYYY
I like the idea of the video slowly morphing into a brutalmoose going on a road trip video.
No crash  bandicoot trying to rip your heart out
Well, once the acquisition is complete, there's going to be no point of bootlegs since crash & spyro will be on cloud gaming & only thing you need, is a subscription.
Every Muslim watching his video when he made his nickname Halal meat 5000 😂😂😂😐🤬🤬
He’s so close to a million subscribers. Come on you cowards! Give him your subscriptions so that we can finally get a Spyro trilogy retrospective. Or you know, he could always make a one hour video about every other phoenix game he hasn’t played instead 😏
Caddy: "I give up easily."  Also caddy: **is masochistic enough to get every single platinum relic across every Cash Banooca game and complete Crash 4 100 percent**
Hey caddy, YouTube isn't showing your channel or your videos when i look for "Caddicarus"   I only found your channel because a dude made a playlist with your videos
Droping a "ladees n gents" on a 2022 vid that got 1.5M views. Life is trash.  7.9/10
U almost hit 1MILL congrats
2k subs and we will finally get the long awaited Spyro videos
Any chances for PS2 Accessories or (for real this time) a review on the original Spyro the Dragon games, Caddy?
I don't know if somebody already tell you but in the game boy color game you need to find a gem and the platform to finish the level will be active. The gba game only have 5 levels, and the one of megadrive/genesis is actually good. and of all the games in console the nes one and the sega genesis was  the best to play. Really funny episode. And good luck in the search of that machine.
i remember  when i dint know what hes name was so on youtube i searched up daddy caddy
27:46 got my dying for some reason🤣
Only 2k left to a million subs
Should I cannibalize a gay person? "Eat Fruit!" Thanks for the advice aku-aku  but I dunno how I'm gonna manage to eat myself
Whoo hoo! At the time of this comment, Cads is 2K away from a 1 Million Subs! Let's make it happen folks! 2K Away from the Spyro Reviews!
Here's who called themselves Halalmeat on the app store, It was me.
26:26 that is the ppsspp emulator for android
LMAO WHY I FOUND U ONLY NOW, I LITTERALLY LOVE YOU AND UR VIDEO, ITS LOOK LIKE "croix89" EDITING STYLE, italian youtuber

gotta love caddy who else would put in such work
Why are you the crash guy
35:28 😂
You're almost at a million!!!
When you said "The bit in the cafe starring Robbie Williams" I thought Robbie Williams was some parody of Robin Williams because of how similar they looked. And then I discover Robbie Williams is indeed, a real and famous person...

It’s so sad that Cash Bandicooties has so many clones.
Do you have braincells?
25:47
Props to Caddy taking a rotary phone to the chest like that. What a trooper.
love your videos. such entertainment.   219056-d3f56cff.
I like your Fate crest. Does this mean that Crash Bandicoot is your servant?
Hey caddy, cash banooka is now exclusively Xbox!
Supporting for the millon Subscribed 💖
Next bandicoot month you should review crash fan games.
what if the lady on the phone was right and Caddi called someone from the past
No lie, that Brazilian NES bootleg is adorable.
go back to slaughter or salvage feels like caddy;s content has either been sub par or just crash bandicoot.
Rip spons
Might as well get started on the Spyro 1m video 👀 years in the waiting
Get ready, everyone.   The 1,000,000 video is next.   😁
Bandicoot month idea: ranking all crash bandicoot games you've played so far. (Not counting bootlegs, or unofficial Crash games)
You’ve almost reached a million subscribers! So excited for that Spyro retrospective!! Woot woot!
6 hours trip just to find a Slot Machine that may or may not exist. You're dedicated mad lad!
WOW! I AM JUMP! JUST LIKE KRASH BANDI!
Could you please do a top 10 crash Bandicoot villains countdown
This video made laugh so hard especially with this one 28:00
There should definitely be a crash bandicoot fall guys costume for crash bandicoot fans like me and caddy. 😁❤️
I swear I remember seeing this one bootleg crash bandicoot game on another bootleg console I owned, I think it was a reskinned ripoff of the jungle book game.
Who knew Crash was this popular?
30:56
Yeah, when someone "thinks" they know where something is, they're usually talking through their hat. You need someone to actually *know* something.  Oh well. Hopefully some day you will find your precious Cash Bandiloot. Maybe even get it installed at a local pub for maximum confusion.
Bandicoot Month
I love bandiconth
This bring backs memories of classic PBG JonTron, and radical soda perfectly crafted into its own thing. This made me smile today.
Can you please try doing a video were you review a console of your own choosing?
Crash Banicootlegs?
This video feels like I’m running off 2 hours of sleep and 3 pounds of coke and playing cash banooca
7:56 funniest thing I've seen in a while
Great vid, see ya in 6 months!

When I lived in China I saw a mural on some mall that had a weird bootleg Crash Bandicoot on it. Like it was clearly meant to be him, but just looked...wrong. I wish I could've snapped a picture of it for ya.
oof, crash furby
You should do anime games
Oh ive seen that crash bandicoot gamblin machine before when my family went out for a meal somewhere (forgot the exact location but  somewhere in the Merseyside area). couldnt play it as i was a minor but some man was playing it and i dont recall is using any official sound or music from what i gathered.
Can you do a video on ben and holly’s little kingdom and it is made by the same people who made pepper pig.
Smb3 has that screen loading issue as well
Just wait till you see Mario bootlegs 😂
Every time I see him destroy something on camera, I have to ask how RICH this dude is that he can smash and break all this stuff?!  Or are they somehow fakes?
33:31 i have never used a gambling machine... BUT IT WAS ALSO MADE BY THE BEST GAMBLING MACHINE GAMES COMPANY, BELL FRUIT GAMES!
The UK has more pubs then blades of  grass
Hey Caddy, Just wanted to say congratulations on almost being at 1million subscribers, only 4k more to go now. I've been with the channel for a long time and have loved it every step of the way. You make some of the best content I've seen on this site and I love every second of your videos. It says a lot that your probably the only YouTuber who makes me want to watch their sponsored segments. I really hope your still planning to make a spyro video for 1million subscribes as I've been looking forward to that ever since your enter the dragonfly video. I can't wait to see my favourite YouTuber cover my favourite game series ever. Thank you for all your awesome content and congratulations on nearly a million. (I'll update this a little when you hit 1mil).
39:21 "SPONS LANE" yes

Guys we're 5k away. It's been years in the making!
please dont wear that cash bandicam suit with those BOT LEGS please.
"I know what you're thinking.  I wouldn't go all this way for one joke."  Frankly I'm surprised it hasn't happened sooner.
funniest moment in the video 0:19
We’re so close to those Spyro reviews!
sounds like an awful lot of extra work just to fill your ELOVIE with cream.
Which video did Caddy say this at 23:58? I tried looking and I can't find it for some reason.
German im Austria, Österreich 🇦🇹
Caddy, do more of these mobile game videos, there are so many terrible mobile games out there (at least on android) its just hilarious
DRAINNNN STATION!!!!! LFGGGGGGG BLADEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Shame On Those People For Ripping Off Crash Bandicoot, Am I Right?
CRASH BANDICOOT V2 "5 2022)😀😀
Is this Disney or something
I love your videos
“Best crossover to defeat Avengers endgame, Crash Bandicoot and Angry Birds.”
Can we talk the glasses
The first one is only one level?
The gun can’t even hit enemies? Did the devs even play it once after programming it?
If it’s Chinese, why is it in English?
2:41 GBC cartridges are water-proof? How did that work after dunking it?
Where does the name bootleg come from anyway?
It looks like caddy is about one video away from the big 1 million
32:54
Crash: WhOa
Não só china tem bootlegs até no Brasil tem
I guess you haven't seen Persian marketplace 😂😂install bazzar or market app stores and you can side load a lot of bootleg not just crash a lot of other franchises and they actually work somehow. Soo yeah.
If anyone manages to get their hands on that “Cash Bandiloot” machine, they should send it to Caddi.
Caddy has had some cool cars over the years. STi (WRX?) wagon, Type R civic, S2000 and Mustang in this video alone. Nice taste.
Umm… “King Chicken” appears to be Kokatorimon. Anyone else notice this?
By any chance, does anyone know what beatmania song was playing at 0:32?
1:27 BRASIL REPRESENTANDO COMO SEMPRE!
eat fruit caddy ooga booga
I just love how Cortex got himself the Shin Getter 1 and The King is just Kokatorimon xD
Bro don’t diss banana kong
Ok, @Caddicarrus, if you could barely find any iOs Crash ripoffs....what was that FOX action game I saw right at the beginning of the video?
Crash dad
you need a holy hand grenade of Antiocvk  to kill the rabbits
I'm incredibly sorry that you had to experience THE NORTH, Caddy. Amazing video as always.

39:28 Spons lane   Spons: *H E L L O!*
We had something similar to karaoto in Greece, also on flea markets but in some cases even on some retail stores in 90s called "master games" or something like that, which also had crash bandicoot and sonic matched together "frankestein style" with super mario bros, a lot of NES/SNES clones or bootlegs in general
Where’s squidward

Japanese translation teams are laughing at you game, shame is on the you
The reason Android's Google Play Store is littered with this shit is because Google also gives no shits about what goes up. Unlike Apple who give more shits then anyone in the universe about what is on their IStore

I swear I saw one of those cash bandiloots in a restaurant/bar or gas station in Wisconsin (where I live)  they have those in the US too
I play this
Caddy drives a mustang?? Eeeeew get a camamamamamaro.

Dude that 8bit crash bootleg from Brazil was actually kinda cool. Makes me wish it ran better or someone else made something similar that ran really well because I actually like that look it has
Crash is too hard
I NEED the crash 3 Advance rom edit: i meant crash 2 advance
7:56 Often I wonder how your creative process works Like How do write the line "gimme five" and think "ah I know, I'll have 5 mini me's on each finger" Pure comedic genius
Hey Caddy, I've got an idea for a video! We suggest our favorite nostalgia games and you could review them
The reason why there's more crap on Android is because it's easier to upload there. Apple has like a $100/month plan and needs an approval process. Android is $25 for the dev account and that's all.
Hold on Caddy Drives a Mustang!? That's dope as hell!    Wait wasn't there a blue Mustang in the Jesus games video....?
Press 7 for Nobbly brown thing on a stick
Dude this is the best caddie episode ever, I’ve laughed so hard that my stomach started hurting. This is amazing
26:24 You can never escape it, Jim.
Is Cash Banooka Food just apples, or just a printed off Picture of the wretched Bandicoot? 👍
Caddy, I have never seen such an incredible, yet slightly unhinged, channel… and I love it!
…King Chicken is Cochitorimon from Digimon. Is that a freaking Digimon in my Crash knock off?!
I’m pretty sure I’ve actually seen a bandiloot machine somewhere near me but I can’t remember which pub it was and it was a while ago so it might not still be there

Caddie Can you make a video for Pyshconauts 1 or 2
7:56
Looks like someone needs a Crash Diet.
Suggestion for a video: Try Zombie Games!!!  (game suggestion: Scheming through the zombie apocalypse)
Once again, you hit it out of the park Caddy!  Though, I have one question. Since you love Crash Bandicoot, what are your thoughts on the Jak and Daxter series, Naughty Dog’s next signature Platformer?
this all ways makes me laugh at least once i hope you get 1m soon
“I’m not Chinese, I’m Caddi.”  Yes, you are, Caddi, and that’s why we love you.
So is there only one video for bandicoot month?
Nice video dude
If you couldn’t tell I’m not Chinese I’m caddie
26:30 this isnt even a port of the psp version. it is the psp version. The program is actually a popular psp emulator called ppsspp and it has its initial menu disabled, instead directed straight to the iso (game file) it downloads of the game.  The "developer" (if you can even call them that) just took an existing program used to run psp games and made an app on the store that downloads the game file (most likely pirated), downloads the emulator, and says that its an original product.
Finally, we see the inside of the Caddylac
I love how much these videos feel like a fever dream.
Everyone we found where spons lives now we can dox him for all the torment he has brung upon Caddy.
Every problems solution: 1996(i think): YOU GOTTA BELIEVE 2022: EAT FRUIT
How strong are u you've split a ps1 controller and snapped a phone in half
The Heat Ambulance xD
Do a video on Godzilla games
Euphonium???
The new intro is awesome and well made.
Hey caddicarus I found a way to find hundreds of android rip offs.
So close to 1 mil Next thing i know ill be getting a notification "10 hour cash banoca stream"
It’s been a while since I’ve watched caddy, but I love this new hour long fever dream format.
Why does Antdude keep playing the role of the Cashman?
Danke!
ffs come on just 7k to go im litraly dieing here i cant wait for that spyro vid. what do we have to do to get you to 1 mill ? id honestly make 7k accounts just to sub to your channel if i knew for a fact youtube wouldnt take them away.
Crush bandi worked for my phone
I think the UK community should help you track down this Crash gambling machine. I'll check my neck of the woods.
Damn, people hit this video hard with that sponsor block.
Ypuve become one of my all time favourite creators. You are hilarious and amszing
oooooh 8000 subscribers till Spyro
SWEET JESUS that animation quality on the opener.   Also Happy Escape The Womb Day (Belated)
33:27 HAAAAAAAAAHH
crash bandicootlegs
Spons could be a reoccurring character
You should make an extended version of who are you gonna call the policemin
6:46 there’s something strange in your neighborhood who are you going to call the policemin
Idk why but around 7:58 that zoom on Caddy’s face and „YAAAAA” cracked me up so badly 😂
THE KING IS BACK LET'S GOOO I totally forgot it was bandicoot month tho, so tomorrow I'm gonna play some good ol crash
As usual, this video was an absolute work of art. Thanks for the laughs, Daddy Caddy.
I really want caddy to do an episode for uncharted since I saw an uncharted 4 box in PS1 games for babies
8000 more subscribers for the spyro review you promised years ago
why have you not reviewed ghost of tsushima yet
Eat fruit!
32:48 , … 33:07 , …what the fish
23:00 this killed me lol
12:46
5:32 If someone does not find that face funny I don't understand
Bandicoot month out of context  0:32 0:41 1:06 1:36 1:58 2:27 4:22 4:47 5:26 5:53 6:18 6:38 7:27 7:42 7:57 8:18 8:32 8:59 10:49 11:03 11:13 11:33 12:33 12:41 12:45 12:52 13:49 14:42 15:30 16:16 17:41 18:52 21:10 24:29 25:16 25:39 26:46 27:46 28:46 29:04 29:29 30:31 30:51 31:21 32:12 32:41 33:06 34:57 38:36 38:51 39:28 40:00  Happy bandicoot month and let’s get this boy to 1 MIL
Better get started on the Spyro video Caddy, I've been waiting like 6 years for this review
Cash banooca
Who would’ve ever thought cortex would be George corpse grinder Ramiro in disguise. He came blood all over that horrible GBA bootleg
6:19
Day 1 of asking Caddy to get the devolper relics in Crash 4.
Is that your s2000 out front? It’s mint lol
WHO CALLED THEMSELVES "HALALMEAT!" i'm dying
I neve see this in Brazil, because i have a real PS1
By lord, Caddy really loves his fans if he was willing to sacrifice 6 hours of his life for us to possibly see gambling machine that bankrupted a company just for our entertainment.  What a trooper! We love you, Caddy! 🫡
10:53 AntDude! ⭐️
23:50 made me laugh so hard
You missed that awful Jungle Book bootleg they made where 'Crash sets out on a journey to reach the man village' xD
12:32 for personal reference
What was the point of litting on fire the crash puppet 😭😭💀
32:14 And That Was The Last We Saw Of Caddicarus
How does he not have a million subs yet everyone needs to follow him
Caddy did you see Ghostbusters afterlife yet. It was pretty good
5:32 That googly eyes Caddy always gets me 😂😂
12:33, 12:41, 12:45
Caddy is super close to 1m subs
this is absolutely unimportant but i'm pretty sure that the second screen where cortex is  c o m i n g  in the first game is a goddamn screencap from a mecha series and i'm not at all sure how to feel
So glad I found this channel! I've been binge watching the videos while doing my art!
22:08 is the funniest part
Thats Furby fed after midnight.
BANDICOOT
Not near enough people are talking about those boots and that walk 1min in! That was ART! 😂
Me after spending 10 minutes on the meme section of a discord server: 18:51
Him saying crash is going to steal my location data always cracks me up
16:36 mmmMMMM00000OOOOO
bbbbbb banicoot
What the heck is an elovie? And why does cortex want cream in it?
Cad i have just the game for you it's called my friend Peppa
Can you beat crash bandicoot without spinning?
10:51 rip
Caddy your so close. The spyro video is within reach
4:00 Thats freaking Kokatorimon from Digimon right there. WTF?
new bandicoot month intro lookin good
Near that big 1M caddy we'll be waiting for the special
30:48  IT'S A FURBY!!!
Hey Daddy Caddy, I recently made a video on the history of Hidden Block and was wondering if you could give me your opinion of it? I worked pretty hard on it, and sorry in advance for the poor editing.
28:47 Am I the only one that finds this funny instead of Creepy?
That Crash Bandoot bird looks like the most sfw Spore creation
"Sadly I live 3 hours away from Manchester " that's your own fault simply live 45 miles away from it like me ....
That psp "port " that literally just used the free ppsspp emulator fast forward button and all was some funny shit
Coddy should become another reccuring character
I love the bandicoot month intro but I laugh when N cortex say....  BANDICOOT
look harder you can buy it, it only took like 2 mins to find one
22:40 favorite moment this video
The burning bandicoot will never not be funny to me
13:49 🎶 _iS iT tOo LaTe NoW tO sAy SoOoOoRrYyYy?_ 🎶 🤪
33:29 HAAAAA
2:47 to 4:06 was as if R/Engrish, R/Boneapptheteeth, and R/Ihadastroke decided to do a fusion dance
Caddy ever thought about doing a megaman x serie review? You've already done the original and x is not that unhealthy to complete (except 6 and 7)
Caddy I'm here to say I remember when you were at 400k and 600k subs and promised you would review spyro for a 1mil special.  I cannot believe I'm seeing you now only 9k away.  This is truly a magical time.
Want me to gather my team, Makoto's and Yu's to find this machine?
How did you actually manage to make butchered dialogue sound good? 😂
When Caddy hits 1M subscribers I'll name a song in honor of his deeds. Suggestions?
I always forget that Caddy is only 2 years older than me. He looks so older, in a good way.
TIL a 3 hour drive for a single purpose isn’t normal outside the Midwest
The ending made me pee! 😂😂😂 Everybody sign my petition for Caddy to rent (or, you know…steal >_> <_<) several party busses and take us all on a road trip complete with old and moldy salads for everybody!
i always wondered where Spons lives..
Caddy is so close to a million subs, please help him. Maybe we’ll get that Spyro video.
This has to be one of your funniest videos so far, I was literally bent over for a solid half of it.
“WOW THANKS DJ MOUTH”
I unironically played Train Station 1, it was a Facebook game, and it was fun, for huh... my 11 years old me I guess? lol
Idk if anyone else picked up on this but in the GBA game when you pick up a wumpa fruit it’s the exact same sound effect as when you make a selection in any menu in the Pokémon games
Daddy caddy! I know I'm just a lowly viewer but I have a movie tie in game for the PS1 I would love to hear your thoughts on. The Mummy staring Brendan Frasier. Actually that would be a nice video all around, playstation 1 movie tie in games.
I did not know what to expect coming into this video, as one can never know what to expect when peering into the abyss that is unlicensed bootleg video games, but I will tell you that I was confident, CONFIDENT I SAY, that I would NOT be seeing the likes of GOD DAMN SHIN GETTER ROBO in it, and yet at 3:44 there it is. I should know better than to be baffled by these kinds of things, I really should, but somehow I'm never prepared for this kind of insanity.
That's nice n all caddy but where's the Medievil 2 video
Play explosion school house of horror sponsors in it
lol half video not about crash
Eddsworld, Buur, tomska,caddicurus many more is the “worth the wait” channels
You did a 6 hour round trip for nearly 1m views. i think that'll cover your petrol costs ;-)
Spons is my favorite character in the Caddy Cinemaddy Universe right next to Baddy
“If you were lucky enough to live in China”, lol.
5:31 dude you killed me right there
14:21 Anyone been able to find this website with the 'Karaoto' console ROM dump??
5:32 when you catch your younger bro on the phone
1:47 2003 crash 2 advance  6:19  Crash Advance 4 10:34 Crash Bandicoot Mega Drive  14:32 Crash Bandicoot 16:13  iPhone Crash Bandicoot  games 33:13 Crash Bandicoot
Daddy Caddy is back
@Caddicarus if it was not you that responded to my comment below, then someone is trying to scam me on the face of your channel.
The Crash Bandicoot NES bootleg needs some debugging and polishing of the scroll routines and some more levels added.
pls help how do i become handsome
IT'S JULY
27:21 ............I mean.....that is a partial solution...
I can't believe you drove to Manchester, the same place that Karl Pilkington lives, Just to find a bootleg Crash Bandicoot Slot Machine. That's awesome.
4:00 is it just me or why does that suspiciously look like kokatorimon from digimon???
Idea: the maniacal world of the postal games
Caddy's neighbours be like "Should we phone the police? There's a strange man prowling around in a costume... wait nvm it's that nutter making another video."
*EAT FRUIT* 🍊
ZS
Man i need to be friends with Caddy and not just because he reminds me of Monty python lol
Cadd makes me luagh so hard that i can barley hear myself luagh
Poor spons😢😢😢😢
13:49 caught me so off guard, I couldn't stop laughing
👍
i do love cortex's famous catchphrase: "i'm coming"
You know what would be funnier   If crashes hand reached for the heart and then took his wallet
22:06 First, seem like someone else has the same sense of humor as Caddi Second, imagine "Halalmeat" actually watched this video
Can't believe caddy went to manchester! I live nearby!
Caddy, I don't understand how you come up with some of your jokes. Please try and enlighten me. How did you come up with "Cos we'd rather have a bowl of embedded pet hair." and why can't I stop watching it on repeat.
Talk about nickelodeon games like you did with DreamWorks and Pixar
6:40 I must admit that music is banging.
So happy we are the same age and birth month
I liked you better with more Hairdicoot.
Guess what our pig friend isn't dead  yes cuz on xbox She apparently has a game on Gamepass
Caddy......I just.....I'm so glad I found your channel because it's like eating a 10 strip of LSD and then trying to make sense of the world.  Thank you so much man, your vids are truly something else. I'm not sure what that something is, but holy SHIT are these something else lol.
2:31 LOL 2:32 2:33 2:34 2:36 2:51  2:54 2:58 3:01 3:02 3:11 3:13 3:19  3:43 3:59 4:00 33:35 34:12 36:30
Honestly, i WAS a little sad when the video was over. It was fun. Lol 😂
7:27 Never fails to make me laugh
"Dreamlike watercity" *desert level*
5:30  You're welcome
27:45 this made me laugh so much ong
15:00 looks like a Metroid 2 ROM Hack. Same jump animation as Samus, some of the platforms look like they are reuse but in colour and it runs at about the same speed as that game. I always forget how clunky M2 is...
How many babies am I legally allowed to step on?  *O O G A   B O O G A .*
3:28
Wow, how many bootleg games crash had all this years. I am russian, but i really never heard about that some people from my country created some bootlegs of cash banooka or saw that bootleg games... Maybe its for the best that i never heard about them
Someone clip the squirrel bit
At this point I wouldn't be surprised if Caddy went to the another country to find something crash related
18:10 That's a good game, Train Station 1 I mean.
2:30 replacing all of the woods that starts with t with d
Whoa
"If there something strange~ in your neighborhood, who you gonna call? The p o l i c e m e n" 6:40
BANDICOOT!?
1:36
27:18-27:33  veagans be like
This is one of my favorite British YouTubers
Feel bad for you
Play fnaf on your flipping channel
13:05 I'm sorry but I guarantee you this videogame isn't brazilian... else it would be sued by copying the great PolyStation.  No, it wasn't a typo.
Is It ToO lAtE nOw To SaY sOrRy!
Luv u caddy
Killing all the my Little Pony puppies 😂
I hope some day find a supportive wife like your wife caddi
I still feel like nobody is addressing the fact that Spons, The Bricks, Baddy, and The Policeman are all on the Villains Fanon wiki, implying that Spons is so much of a villain that he gets a spot in a fandom wiki about fanmade villains, is the son of Caddicarus, and is also the main antagonist of a show where a man dressed up as Jesus and walked into a burger store, drove several hours to find a bootleg slot machine, has an everlasting disdain for a pig named Peppa, and is probably clinically obsessed with an orange marsupial's buttocks.
31:16 super mario galaxy mario long jump and maybe spin animation
I guess what they say is true: The English think 200 miles is a really long trip.  Americans think 200 years is a really long time.  I routinely make a 6-hour drive ONE WAY in the US.  If you do that in Great Britain, you might end your trip as a submariner.  But I get it.  I don't ENJOY that 6-hour drive. As a matter of fact, I think I might actually be enough of a home-body to apply for Honorary Englishman status.  Keep up the good work Caddi.
Alright caddy, that was a great video. See you in 3 years after another global pandemic, your house setting on fire and you being falsely accused of a crime that you did not commit, causing you to lose your livelihood and take a 6 month break.
Fun fact I have actually played super crashing bird as a joke 1 year ago and it works well for a while and then when you get to the 2nd page of levels there is an impossible path to cross
6:19 “I’m calling for the toaster for my sandwich”
35:38 Blue T-Shirt. And in the rest of the video, it's black.  HUUUUUUHHH???!!????
Oh damn, your so close to a million
yes!!!
So will Caddy show the video footage of him seeing that Crash Bandicoot machine? Also love the video Caddy!
Off topic, but I'm waiting on a review for the new Peppa Pig game on switch and I think steam :)
3:43 is that neon genesis evangelion?
I like to think that whenever Caddy dies or turns into something in one of his skits, we transfer to another dimension where he survived.
27:10 I think it wants you to eat fruit.
5:30
Cash ban cum
It never ceases to amaze me how consistently greasy you look.
June is my birthday
June is a birthday
"How do I grow fruit?"  "EAT FRUIT!"
Honestly, I feel like we are watching Caddicarus going insane!
I managed to launch crazy fox adventure ,i kept crashing at the intro  but if you spam bottom right then middle left you Can start the first level
At least some of the games live up to their name... I mean "crash". :D
from russia with love
man caddicarus likes crash bandicoot
7:56 "Hhahaa Give me five." _1_ _2_ _3_ _4_ _5_ _"Jä."_
Well i for one I never ever heard of Crash Bootlegs, because I’m a big fan of the marsopable if i do say so myself this is definitely interesting, and yo Bandicoot, month again yas.
28:46 is EXACTLY the kind of nightmare-fuel that makes me desperately want to see you and a fella by the name of  Will McDaniel  do some stuff together.
19:50 Don't poop on the stairs
Caddy is like a fusion of the comedy of Monty Python and the chaotic surrealism of Wonder Showzen/Tim and Eric
If you didn't meet a Gallagher brother while visiting Manchester City, it didn't happen.
Solid gold prolapses
After seeing you, an adult man, take such a long pilgrimage to find a mere slot machine...I have every reason to believe you're on the spectrum.  Also there's someone trying to impersonate you...obviously.
The. Dedication. :D
I wonder if there is a fnaf crash bandicoot game
I need more Uncle Funcle in my life!
22:40 is the best thing ever
Why did ukka ukkas answer feel completely in character
-maybe a pokemon one?- -just that one watcher that plays pokemon-
OMG thats amazing to see an SFM animater creating an intro
Hey caddicarus been loving your videos as there funny as well as enlightening but when I discovered your crash content my feelings for the banooka went from knowing he exists to pure love for the orange rat also my birthday is next month and I'm hoping the get the modern 4 crash games but while I wait I'm playing my copy of wrath of cortex though due to lack of memory card I'll be playing the same few levels over and over oh well guess that means I could try getting platinum relics on them
“Taco Bell Bum Wee” 😂
14:41 My favourite scene is this one. Is just so epicly ridiculous
Eat fruit!!
Lol oh jesus this one is freaking hilarious man, well done!!
Day 419 of asking caddy daddy to review Rayman 3: Globox’s fix for plum juice
I never saw that console before here in Brazil, but for future reference, any bootleg console you buy here has that same set of games!
It's a Caddy video when you're already smiling 5 minutes in
18:31 I'm sad Caddy didn't go *2.5D!!!*
23:07 the word you are looking for is "responsitriligous"
Caddicarus is one of those creators that have gotten better and better over the years. Great vid caddy
Like
Glad to see crash again
"Is it because I got this game from the man who lives in the rubbish?"
*Bandiconth*   *Bottom text*
Crash Bandicoot + Angry Birds = Furby
BANDICONTH
3 hours is nothing you British bast
I immediately died at 1:38 *And 1:57... I'm not gonna survive this vid
Caddy, the bricks are back at my house again.
Crush bandi is prolly just some crypto mining tool. Once you open it... It activates the mining and you are left without a wonderful bootleg mobile crash game
PENISTONE YEEAAAAAAAH Caddy came to Barnsley
how are you still funny after all these years very inpressive
good job at almost 1 million subscribers
14:39 CYOAR would be perfect...
EAT FRUIT!! LOL
So in response to the android port of the psp port of crash of the Titans, it appears to just be using ppsspp as a shell which is on Android as is
Bandiconth is back
16:15 I can’t explain it but this bit had me rolling.
That zombies roadkill game is actually a ripoff of another game i absolutely adored back in the day called zombie highway 2. I never updated it and it's still on my ipod touch gen4 with a halloween event.
Awesome video
Hey... where's crash gone? .... *hello* :D
5:29
6:43
You're a true comedian 🤣
4:23-4:28  7:08-7:12  7:37-7:46  32:12-32:19
American accent caddy isn't real. It can't hurt you.  ... 6:19
This is Caddy at full..no, PEAK POWER.
I swear 'King Chicken' looks exactly like Kokatorimon from the Digimon franchise.
Crash on Sager. Who would've thought it would ever be a thing.
Become an animal fact channel.
I certainly find amazing that in bandicoot month the ps plus free game of the month is crash 4
How do we solve world hunger? Aku Aku: Eat fruit! lmao
Brilliant 👏 keep doing what you’re doing please dude, awesome video
Coddy is gonna be my new sleep paralysis demon
How am I doing? I’m sick as a… living thing that is sick.
Video: has brazil mentioned in any way     Brazilians: *quem foi o bunda mole que sumonou o ser ancião*
Good
When he says yep I don’t need to see anymore and dives into the Dumpster I rewound it over and over again. I laughed so hard
2:34 Caddy is drain gang???
Thanks for the brasilian flag at the thumb, Caddy! Obrigado pela bandeira do Brasil na thumb, Caddy!
The "tuberculosis" bit killed me XD
Crash foxes description is just crash trying to speak english
thanks for the video
He's close to 1 mil, can't wait for the spyro video
0:02 After all these years Caddi has finally evolved to final form of Crash Bandicoot fan😂😂😂😂
8:16
38:37
Finally someone who mentioned those THE NORTH signs haha
25:16 and other killer bit
22:43 good bit
Caddy sounds like a British and acts like an American.
26:25 thats literally just the ppsspp emulator with the crash of the titans rom...
Hey Caddy, pardon the overly-familiar question, but is that your blue Mustang or did you hire it for the 3 hour journey to Manchester?
ТЕЙВНУ - possessive form of Tawna. As a Ukrainian we were forced to learn russian since childhood, we have a war for our children to have the freedom not to. But whole quip is Crash one prologue, Cortex kidnaps girlfriend, blackmails Crash who says Sweet Fanny Adams and goes jumping on stuff.
Yes
I am the real Crosh Bondercoog and I have been trapped in a cave for 5 years please help me I am typing this on a lost calculator my coordinates are 25.0000° N, 71.0000° W
3:24 WHAT THE HELL, SHIN GETTER ROBO??? THE LAST THING I WAS EXPECTING TO SEE HERE IS A STONER SUNSHINE
I love how Caddy cannot keep a straight face and breaks character. Especially with the glasses (?) things
6:40 the policeman busters music video
3:49 So... I see Crash Bandicoot isn't the only stolen IP... Frickin Shin Getter is in the bootleg too.
This video was hilarious
24:28-24:43 That killed me the first time I saw it
30:00 i remember play this game years ago, but with Crash, not with, well, Crash the fox Bandi xD. The developer only changed the model
13:49 I can’t help but laugh every time I hear this and idk why but that is just gold
I honestly wanna know more about that phone lady and how she got it wrong.. since.. you said it was like a pub connected to a hotel or something yet the pub you went to didn't look like it was connected to one...  God I hope it wasn't like you went to wrong one and it was just sitting waiting for you.. and the pub guy also was just like "ya whatever, a machine, we change those" and was just wrong about it XD
That gun isn't sawnoff
The machine might be referring to some emulators
I live in a town on the off skirts of Manchester (Walkden) n I was eagerly watching for anything I recognised like an absolute idiot.  I didn't recognise anything other than M&S being a thing. Even the barman didn't sound local 😂
New subscriber,  I love the content. Got me rolling on the floor laughing! Keep up the great work
That Uka Uka from that question had me rolling
You should visit the annoying world of Dora the Explorer games.
Eat fruit!
Maybe one day you can do a video on Pokémon games
00:40 Honestly i was expecting a twat at the end of that skit.
Is the crash  bandileg just caddies  fursona
22:31
happy late bandiconth
5:30
Dude I absolutely loved this video & am gutted you didn’t find Cash Bandiloot but I’m dropping my first comment to say I had the privilege of paying Cash Bandiloot 3 months ago in Brightons Witherspons! Don’t know if you’re near there or if you’ll even see this but here’s to hoping
Greetings from THE NORTH! Awesome video, as always.
even though caddicarus had cheese grated his knuckle and was 1 day late to bandiconth, he will always do things to support his followers, and follow the footsteps of the greatest god in gaming history: CASH BANOOCA!!!!!!!
you're pretty funny tbh
If someone tries to do a try not to laugh on this video and doesn’t laugh, then your more dull then Caddy’s pencil he used to end Michael Mouse.
Missed opportunity with the birds tweeting in the beginning and saying twat at the end
Perhaps the bootleg machine was the friends we made along the way?
i would love it if you play cuphead
5:33 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
28:43 They should get Cim Jummings to do voices for Coco Crash Adventure 2
there's a copy of brazil in this video like
3:39: "Your god, I am!" *shows a picture of Dobby*
It’s hard to think of six hours as a long trip. We have a road trip this weekend that’s 24 hours each way. And if I want to see my in-laws it’s 36 hours each way.
Caddy, Make a video about loud house or you will be given a Googleplex copies of Crash bash, Tweenies game time and Peppa pig CDs and will be forced too play them all
Once again proving that the App Store for iPhone, is at least halfway curated. The Google play store is pretty much anything goes.
Ah yes, I love my yearly installment of BANDI-CUNTH (ft. CASH BANOOKA) from daddy Caddy himself. Great work man.
What's great about this is that I just realized I got 106% completion on crash 4 during Bandicoot Month. At least losing my sanity was worth it somewhat lol
Dudh
11:33 wait...wye valley?! I live around wye Valley! Have I been living this close to Caddy all this time and not known? I work at the Saracens Head, I wonder if Caddy has ever been there...
Why is Shin Getter Robo in a bootleg cash banooka?!
i thought i was a stonefaced god... and then the printer gag had me howling
The glasses are just the funniest hahaha nice one caddy
I'm sorry Does that first bootleg have a motherfucking kokatorimon
"Play fall guys before June 23rd for this free thing!"  ...video released on July 3rd....
Hell yeah the bandicoot month is back
Please do a “not so heroic world of superhero    Games”
is that crash costume from aliexspres or wish you know what that doesn't matter your so funny putin pooed in a tin hahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahah
CASH BANOOKA
Door Door is the first game by Enix
i honest to god scream laugh every time the crash or sonic costumes appear
Hey, Caddi!  Uh, can you, like, beg people to subscribe ?  Seriously, you have no idea how bad I want that Spyro video.
Hey, Caddi!  Uh, can you, like, beg people to subscribe ?  Seriously, you have no idea how bad I want that Spyro video.
Bro what did you watch growing up? Your humour is so chaotic? Who are you influenced cause I can only guess the movie The Mask
There may be a surprising amount of illegal Bandicoot games, but the fact isn't surprising.
who did call themselves halalmeat?
Another video, another perished child
5:26 for rthe glasses.
Watching again because I do what I’m told.
3:55 is- is that cockatrimon from digimon?
On the first game, I think the "chicken" sprite was a Cockatrimon Sprite hahaha.
we're the same age and that makes me sad.
Caddy and Crash should’ve done E.T. and became B.T. aka Bandicoot Terrestrial. B.T. phone home.
I’m sorry but the video peaked at 5:25
I don’t want to play video games on youtube anymore. I want to be an animal fact checker… had me dead 😂
Can I just say I love the progression of this channel from understandably cringey teenage Caddy to eloquent hardass early 20s Caddy to batshit insane post-COVID Caddy
Well, fellow June born king, Im sorry you couldnt get a good present. So, Ill just say happy belated birthday in the meantime
I wonder if you would play Mario bootlegs. There are practically a ton of them.
It was a GI Jane joke
Eat fruit!

Yeah baby that’s what I’ve been waiting for that’s what it’s all about
Just started the vid and I haven't watched caddy in years so as soon as I saw him I did not recognize him. Like did they make gender affirming therapy for cis men or what.
Caddy. Brilliant video as always. Also very much enjoyed your stream of Wrath of Cortex.  Just thought you would like to know, I'm a collector for these pub machines and there is a Cash Bandiloot machine in a pub called "The Cutting Room" St Mary's Way, Melton Mowbray LE13 1YE.   I haven't been there in a couple of months as I'm a bit further north and was there as cover for another collector but I have a picture of it from April 2022.
crazy bandicoot is not a video game icon. it really bothers me to even look at it. it honestly deserves so much less attention.
5:27 😂😂🤣
Trick question, dont care. Is the best opening ive ever heard XD
Has anyone else realized that we are dangerously close to getting caddy 1mil subs?   And we all know what that means.
CADDY HOW HAVE YOU MASTERED MY HUMOR       P E R F E C T L Y    YOU WIZARD OF A MAN I LOVE YOU SO PLATONICALLY
1:57 5:22 11:26 18:48 My favorite parts lol damn I'm dark
7:56 underrated gag that makes me laugh every time
All that way to go to a tobys carvery
Local British man cleaves his knuckle off with a cheese grater after going on a 3 hour car trip to find a bootleg Crash Bandicoot slot machine. More at 11.
Has Caddicarus tried playing fan Crash Bandicoot games on LittleBigPlanet and/or Dreams?
33:08 my cat when i drown horribly
26:43 This kinda does sound like something's messed up...
There not apples
Can you review valves famous half life series
Crash:Battle Royal
Do Spyro bootleg games next!
Oh my god, I've seen a Cash Bandiloot machine in the wild and remember wondering if it was in any way licensed
That bird from the first bootleg, isn't that Kokatorimon from Digimon?
I think Caddy in a Crash Bandicoot in Stiletto Thigh Boots is one of the most spectacular and wierd things he's done. Lol.
BANDICO-
Oh no... Steve Jobs must have asked the Crash Tiki's Choice app how he could cure his cancer.
23:46 what is that song?
This channel needs to get 1million subs already
Tweet tweet tweetie tweet
Syntax? Like syntax error
10 seconds into this video and I’m already laughing!
Can we talk about the fact caddy owns a mustang
"I give up quite easily" A MAN WHO 100% ALL CRASH BANDICOOT GAMES ON THE PS1
That was wonderful. Thank you for sacrificing part of your hand for us
5:31
Seriously man you have a gift, your humor and comedy is so hilarious and unique! Thanks for always giving me a laugh
28:13 its not shit!
I had to ee watch that magnifying glasses scene 3 times
28:46 creepy but hilarious at the same time
what a ride xD
Caddy, I would love to see a travel vlog video of sorts from you! I'd think it would be very funny  😂
I liked the part when 6:22
All that Engrish is derightfurry hirarious! There spleeing iz grate!
"Oh hole, a shit" had no right to make me pause the video and leave a comment about it
This is legitimately one of the funniest videos I've seen in a while
In 1:34 you can see a iranian illegal copy of crash bandicoot released by an indie publisher in Iran (their main purpose is to copy game files onto disk from site that have the roms inside,mainly for ps1 and ps2)
Why did I watch this at 3am, I'm fuckin' crying 🤣  6:19 sent me I'm WHEEZING
5:32
i have a karaoto console but it looks like an NES console and has 600 games
Did you make a who framed Rodger rabbit reference with the big barrel as dip?
5:32 died right here too
You laugh, but you have opened a can of worms caddy, somebody is going to hunt down that slot machine now and when you least suspect it, it will be there, watching.
Awesome video Cad Bandicad! I had an idea for one you could do, The Obnoxious World Of Kart Racers. There's so many kart racing games, I'd love to hear you talk more about the ones you've already talked about as well as some other ones, Especially the hidden gem known as Jimmy Johnson's Anything With An Engine 😂
And just like that, he’s gone.
Don’t apologize! Bandicoot month is not bound by space or time!
I don't understand. How he keeps murdering his children after his wife taking away the children a video ago? HOW MANY CHILDREN DOES CADDY HAVE?!
But was the food at that pub any good...?
22:46 Jesus, don’t mess with Caddy, he took a thrown rotary phone to the shoulder for a gag and didn’t even flinch.
I will so have too visit spons lane LOL
So someone from Portugal stole a illegal copy that came from a Brazilian console... Pfft, typical colonizers
23:57 What video is this clip from again?
Caddy aslong as you make crash videos pleases always make a bouns rounds bit that shit is always funny
I’m watching a second time because Daddy Caddy requested it.  Even funnier the second time
19:39 had me dying of laughter because I’m a big Thomas the Tank Engine fan
15:23 😂
1:08 Holy shit Bigfoot in the wild
25:28
31:38 Yes, I am actually
Honestly the amount of bad rip off apps there are on stores is sad and outrageous. No moderation at all they literally take anything without a care for the quality and from what I have seen in this video are designed to take advantage of every aspect of the customers information. Do they really not care at all. I understand mobile is a rabbit whole of loophole’s in many cases, but they can say no to products if they want can’t they.
Time to celebeate with Coco Rule 34
ballooins
Why do you sit so close to the steering wheel cousin
Fun fact: the bootleg company sintax's games on the game boy advance have never had their Roms put online so I would recommend putting crash advance 4's rom online as that would make you apart of bootleg game history
Glad to see you keeping it moving forward! Cheers brother
I love the bits you leave in where you or your girlfriend laugh. It makes the video much funnier in my opinion
Thx daddy caddy
💓 the content
It's been a hot minute since I've laughed so hard my nuts hurt but the oh no my queen bit is hurting me
I wonder if Beenox got the idea for King Chicken from that one bootleg...
This was posted on my brother's 20th birthday! 3:54 That's Kokatorimon from the Digimon series! 6:22 Jesus, how did you pull this stunt off?
We had thats exact machine in our local chippy in Arbroath and it was so greasy because it was right beside the fryers.
Oh my god I can't believe you went to Manchester for that joke. That place is like a vegan pig in a blanket.
2:12 4:23 8:43
When he said three hours I thought" Oh that's not too long a drive" but then I remembered he's British
Hey caddy can you do the worst spider man games?
In the tags: #FallGuys  You ride that algorithm, Caddy!
5:28 I love how even they know how utterly silly it looks and it made it so much funnier 🤣🤣🤣
Ive been told to watch it again, so here I am
23:52 COS WE RATHER HAVE A BOWL OF EMBEDDED PET HAIR!
The scene with the glasses had me dying laughing
EXE
5:26 honestly, one of the best parts of this video.
Oh my god.... In the first game that you reviewed.... They were not just ripping off Crash.... That chicken character is an enemy from Digimon.... * face palms *
23:58 best flashback
Greetings from Greece, you are a treasure mate.
28:00 Caddy.....  Caddy......  ....Caddy....?  ..............F**KING GIVE US MORE UNCLE FUNCLE!  Edit: Also more 'Coddy'!
I don’t have the GBA Crash bootleg, BUT I do have Mario DX and Sonic 3 Fighter Sonic(both games use the same engine as Crash IV)
I have seriously been waiting for caddy to upload! This is one of the best videos ever!
I'm going to guess that the reason why there are so many bootleg games in the google playstore is because android phones are more accessible than Apple's. And there is an issue with compatibility.
is anyone gonna talk about the shin getter robo at 3:41
I think have actually seen the Cash Bandiloot machines before. Somewhere in one of the casinos in Atlantic City
You're an amazing
These aren’t illegal. It’s just perfected to the point the cops don’t want you playing em
That Crash Bandicoot 4 GBA game is basically a graphic swap of a bootleg Sonic game called Sonic 3 Fighter Sonic which features the exact same mechanics and soundtrack
I've never seen someone so full of glee sticking a fork into an electrical socket as much as Caddy here. At least he got better afterwards, kiddies. You might not.
28:00 im fkn dead
My four year old is now running around the house shouting "Eat fruit!!!"
caddy being a little too obsessed with Crash Bandicoot is the only instance of over-obsession that I’m okay with.
3:29 Iron Lung (David Symanski, 2022)
Bandicootlegs
I love that this is the only episode I've seen that has a break in commentary
1:18 yea, I'm lucky enough to live in China or Russia, how'd ya tell
The crash psp game stole a psp emulator
Hope you at least enjoyed your road trip.
no word of a lie I saw that cash bandicoot machine at the Weatherspoons in Stirling, Scotland 2 days ago!
i eat the "knobbly brown thing on a stick" sometimes, ngl
My wife came in and started shaking me because she thought I was losing my mind perhaps I was laughing a tad to hard XD
Night of the coconut
Caddicsrus talking about how he found the PS1 accessories as if they’re his peak of bloodhound skill, as if he didn’t scour Chinese websites for a Crash Bandicoot phone game from the mid 2000s
Is nobody going to talk about the 'digimon' around 3:47 that pops up after Gringott talks like Yoda/Dobby?
thats a Kokatorimon from digimon at 3:57
"bootlegs* slap HAHAHAHAHA I'm dying
3:28 shin getter robo 🤣
I KNOW WHERE TO FIND A CASH BANDILOOT...  So I regularly take holidays down to Skegness in the UK, which is on the East coast in Lincolnshire.  There is a pub there that 100% has Cash Bandiloot and has had it for a long while. I randomly stumbled into it one time and went in JUST to take a photo. If you're in the Skegness area and fancy annoying the bar staff, go to the WaterHole Pub in Skegness! The pictures on Google Maps has the machine there clear as day!
I always wonder if his revenue for this video is gonna cover the cost of his video productions😭
2:40 I'm pretty sure that's supposed to be GBC/A, as in GameBoy Color or GameBoy Advance... maybe...
Portugal is not the same has Brazil
Don’t care for bootleg Crash games. I just prefer your humor. Great job!
I actually decided to play ,,Super Crash Battle Adventure" on my phone and... It's kinda unplayable in terms of controls. They're unbearable.
14:22 As a portuguese im proud of this man
8:25
You will get your Million subs by the end of the year, and it'll be well deserved. Looking forward to the Spyro!
Wish I got this offer whenever a game glitches or breaks. 6:18
I almost cried with Cortex at the start, and that last bit was amazing.
B-B-B-BANDICOOT
I got so drunk while watching this I had to piss in a Mtn. dew bottle
#notmybanooca
I get that it makes me the odd one, but as someone in Texas, hearing Caddy say "it's three hours away" my first thought was, "Awesome! Not that far!"
Well, If this information can help... I'm brazilian and never see this "Karaoto"... But i see a lot of "Polystation", and i think that is EXACTLY the same thing With a dofferent name...
These videos always make me laugh and if I hade a bad day I watch one of these videos and it makes my day much better or nicer. Keep up the work.
There is a game that is a rip-off of Crash. Please look for the M&Ms game for PS1
38:54 is that an S2K Caddy?
1:38
jfc what an obnoxious video. this wouldn’t need to be over 40 minutes long if you weren’t trying so hard to be funny every ten seconds. couldn’t even get through 5 minutes
Taco bell bum wee
This dudes utter dedication to reading the badly translated text is awe inspiring
But… it was the bandicoot 😫
Update-Your review of Zombie Run has been taken down
whoever named themselves halalmeat is either Caddy from another universe or they are on crack
Eat fruit!
I thought that they were mangoes
It must be a British thing but I think it's funny Caddy thinks a three hour drive is too long because recently I had to do a two day long drive to go from my hometown in Pennsylvania to Disney World in Florida
4:23 5:26 6:18 7:56 8:18 8:30 8:55 10:36 12:00 14:40 15:15 15:50 16:48 17:03 17:26 18:17 18:52 19:35 20:55 31:36
Eat Fruit!
I haven’t seen too many of your vids and from the first vid I watched you were hilarious (it was a crash vid) and these little bits you do throughout your vids are so amazing and gut busting to watch. From a pair of fresh eyes you are simply great caddi, truly gold.
The Chicken in the first bootleg looks like Kokatorimon from Digimon. Just thought i'd mention that, since that is literally the first thing that came to my head when i saw that Chicken.
I lowkey love spons
This is how you know I'm a texan. I heard '3 hour drive' and I was like "oh wow that's pretty close then." Like I plan on doing that later this month for lunch with my mom. Distances are weird
17:30 Crash Bandicoot the IP Stealer
My friend had a gba game called Crash Advance 4 and the controls were A to spin, B to jump. It had long and extremely difficult levels in it. He told me his aunt in Saudi Arabia sent him it but now he has lost and tells me he bought it in Game and the box had Crash holding a wumpa fruit in the cover. Has anyone else heard of this game?
i will never understand how you can come up with so many small but funny bits like the gimme five one
I always wonder what your neighbours think of you. Keep being you always.
It's good to see the world is no longer bricks
0:42 If only birds sounded like that
WHY IS SHIN GETTER ROBO IN THE FIRST GAME
I could comment on just about everything in this video, but I just want to know... the spons bit... were you saying that Fall Guys... sucks?
Cash banooka
...Was that Shin Getter Robo?
As an American Midwesterner, I do chuckle that Caddy was dreading the 3 hr drive for being "long".
Caddy drove so close to my town in this video it makes me want to doxx myself from excitement.
IIRC wasn’t there an M&Ms game that was a Crash Bandicoot ripoff?
I'M HAHALMEAT!!! it's a family name
0:09 - 0:23: Oh look, the Bandicoot Month intro is now 3D! I mean, you've obviously just extracted models from Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, but for your first time using CGI for the intro, you did a pretty good job.
24:36 even when I know Caddy will subvert my expectations he still gets me. He is pure chaos.
This video is hilarious from start to finish. Great job, Caddy!!
I feel like Caddy is slowly going insane
Oh boy, Cash Banooca
Didn’t know caddy  and I share the same birth month and are the same age
26:25 they literally just stole the PPSSPP Buttons
I've been noticing he leans hard into Bandicoot games. well at least that's what YouTube wants me to believe.   It seems as tho that's the only thumb nails of this channel the Ol' algorithm wants me see
FUN FACT: The first bootleg has stolen screenshots from Shin Getter Robo
1:37 that was funny but also more scary than the ring face
The dire rears sounds like a shit dire straights cover band.  I kinda wanna do it.
The gbc/a machine probably ment game boy color and game boy advance
11:26 you can't make this shit up
There are so many new characters in this video that are terrifying. They were the ones who killed that old man with the scarf that talked fast.
Brasil
Man we should set up a giant search party for that machine, really disappointed he missed it tbh 😔
3:24 SHIT  IT'S SHIN GETTER ROBO!  THERE'S NOWHERE TO RUN!
11:21 Dr Cortex kidnaps girlfriend of crash bandicoot - teivn for crash to do his evil plan. Crash refuses and is on the way to save his love
I live near Glossop omg haha xD
The printer in the face is the best thing this year!
27:29 is it concerning that i instantly knew this was a refrence to the trill kill episode?
My school gave me the bootleg gameboy for that bootleg console
5:32   let's be real - no one could hold thier laughter when Caddi tries to look perplexed while wearing glasses that make his eyes look like they wee stung by a bee
35:05 Living in Manchester myself, it feels so weird seeing Ring Road, the Stockport Viaduct and signs for Hyde (literally 5 miles from where I live) in a Caddicarus video. *he's coming for me. caddy and spons are coming for me and there is nothing i can do.*
4:30 into the video, and I’m still laughing about the singing birds
Cash Bandiloot is in Aberdeen - The justice mill - just saying caddi
"Putin.........pooed in a tin"
I think the last time you mentioned Sega on your Channel was when you talked about Sonic Free Riders
"Don't tell me to start huffing and puffing, ill start hissing and pissing" -Caddicarus 2022 Best quote from Caddi to date xD
Of all the times for my country, Portugal, to get any representation, and it's for some loser ripping bootleg roms.
28th birthday… j turned 29 in January heading towards 30…
I hope that's a 5.0 caddy?
Ah yes. Kush Bighookah.
With great power comes great spons
How do we solve global warming?  EAT FRUIT! How do we find aliens? EAT FRUIT! How do you escape the friend-zone?  EAT FRUIT!!
*"Not my problem."* ---Uka uka
I think it's safe to say Caddy has finally snapped.
21:21 thats a rip-off of another game, called zombie highway
ITS CRASH‼️‼️‼️‼️     CRASH BANUUKA‼️‼️‼️‼️
11:09  the moment i saw the KDS logo i just went  *Oh..no.....* they are famous for making a ton of "amazing" games like for example: "lego batman" for the mega drive
Ahhh yes The video I always wanted and forgot about until I got it.
Caddy owns a mustang omg. AMERICAN MUSCLE YEEEEEEEAAAAAAAH
"Putin pooed in a tin" that's a clever usage of words.
26:24 ppsspp devs would be very upset
Oh snap, Caddy rocks a Mustang!    CAMARO 4 LIFE MUSTANGS SUCK
These phones are going to be so infested with malware!
Why is the collecting whompa sound in Crash Advance 4 the text advancing sound from the Gen3 Pokemon games? Thats such a specific sound to rip off
8:17 what’s with the kingdom hearts sound effects
I absolutely love the little character break at 5:33
This man knows how to do stupid / weird humor right
Tick question don't care 😂😂😂😂😂
Oh yes crash bandicoot boot legs is what I'm here for XD
29:54: Damm.
Half my fun of watching Caddy is seeing what cars will be in the vids lol
I swear there is a Crash Bandiloot in High Wycombe Wetherspoons mate, you didn't have to drive all the way to Manchester lol, ill go check when im next there.
3:24 looks like cortex is using getter energy for his evil plans
Kimba the White Lion!
Hmmm is very interesting 🤔
I think Caddicarus needs to be careful if he knows where spons lives
How many funny synonyms can you make up🤣  Cash banooca Crash bandi Crash bandicum😨 Crash bash Cash bandiloot
Your videos keep getting funnier caddy!
I'm just glad that Caddi has lost his last shiver of sanity because now he has nothing to lose anymore.
Your video is blessed by a resident of Penistone
The cutaway gags for Crashing Bird are top notch.
Caddy, you suvener... the barman at 37:39 says "You alright, duck". He was just giving you a norvener's friendly greeting.
I just want to say I love that PlayStation five is giving away the most recent bandicoot game for PlayStation plus essential members~
Couldn't you ask the pub who their games dealer is and ask the dealer about it? 🤔
14:03 NUTS MILUK
22:46 Why does the noise make it funnier?
Dang dawg you missed a good chance to say the n word.
11:25 oh my god, this is russian.
And here we have some new creatures in Caddy’s House of Demented and…words. 16:16 - Caddy Creepy Hand-Mouths  28:47 - The Gray Man  32:42 - Coddy   Also, Caddy’s daughter forgot to toss the Phone Cabin too.
Im a vegiterean and i love eating birds  (im not but i do love eating birds)
The mental image of Daddy Caddy walking into a pub to ask about Crash Bandi will forever entertain me.
It's Not "ENGLISH JREASURES" It's English Jr. (Short for Junior) Reasures (What's a reasuer?? I don't know. It's possibly short for Erasure??)  And you should have Spelled Druck, Drip and Drain with what they used on the Bootleg Cart:: Jruck, Jrip & Jrain. LoL... ALL of which are SUPER WRONG.  Plus++ It's not GAM E DUEA, It's GAM ED UEA! LMAO!! X' - D
So when the spons shower Up hello i am My headphones just infomred me that it was on low battery so it became hello i am low battery
Pe-nis!
Commenting for the algorithm.
While I did miss the old intro, that new intro was *beautiful!!!* Whoever you worked with to do it did a great job! I love to see how this channel grows and builds it content.
I like the continuity of Ant being the voice of Crash, it's a nice touch. Great video Cad, if it makes you feel better my sister almost cut her whole finger off once and she recovered, so I think you'll get better soon. Physically of course, we all know you're too far gone to save your mental health
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA lagonga
5:32 I have found my favorite blooper-esque moment in just about all of Caddy's videos. He finally gets so goofy that he makes himself and the cameraman go off script and wheeze of laughter XD
5:53 idk why but this has become one of my absolute favorite caddy bits ever
My man, that glasses gag was the best thing I've seen all day!
The glasses bit was amazing
Oh how I missed you caddy daddy 🥺🥺
Karaoto is just like the polystation here on brazil just a cheap knockoff of arcade and nes/snes games that look like a PS1 and needs cartrigdes
3:25 GETTER ROBO GANG RISE UP
1:58 when I See Channels I used to follow becoming Vtubers
The amount of time and effort you put into your videos for our boy Crash is phenomenal! Keep it up Caddy!
5:33 I think that's the first time I've ever seen Caddy break character in his video and the blooper making it into the final cut. 😂  Also, 8:15 the coin collection sound is totally the interface sound effect for Pokémon Red/Blue/Yellow. 🤔
That's what I appreciate about Caddy, There aint no mountain high enough, aint no valley low enough, and aint no river wide enough to keep him from providing us with god tier comedic content
5:31 got me so good
It's such a British thing to think that driving for three hours is some kind of significant undertaking.  The UK - where nothing is more than five hours away.  Here in western Canada it's a different story...
When are we going to do the useless word of PlayStation two accessories
Caddy you kill me 🤣
Polistation and Brasil mentioned 💯💥🌟🌟🎊🎊🎉🎉
Oh shit… someone been eating good 🌚
25:42 The best game of our generation
honestly surprised how companies still want to sponsor this channel with all the contents
21:10 LOVE that reaction, I so wanna find a mask just like that one
Take care, Caddi, because your videos give me something to look forward to, aside from the eventual return of my workaholic lover or that sweet release that eventually claims us all...  ...so please stop fighting with the cheese graters, they've seen some shit and fight dirty with no exceptions.  (Legit, though, your humor is appreciated and I wish you a speedy recovery. Looking forward to the next glimpse of madness into the Caddiverse, whenever you're healed and ready!)
what a wild video haha
I played the moment at 5:32  at least ten times. I love how that moment was probably unscripted and you left in the raw footage of you guys laughing at your happy accident.   XD
11:33 that made my day ♥️
29:58 V2 was a missile Germany researched on during WW2.
@4:00 wtf is Cockatrimon from Digimon (the chicken-thing) doing with Cash Banooka??
did... did cortex just build shin getter and sunshined the planet?
Ah yes, famous Crash Bandicoot character: Kokatorimon
Not sure who's gonna get this reference, but Kyle Schwarber apparently thinks it's still June as well, so you're not alone.
You’re the best
BANDICONTH!!! Yaaaay
Ironically, you can find one of those knockoff Brazilian consoles on every single corner here. Like, you can go to almost any store and you will see a type of PolyStation.
Unexpected Caddistang
This isn't a Slaughter, this is a _full-on _*_Massacre!_*
I can't wait for next year's Bandiconth video, "The Blocky World of Crash Bandicoot Box Art".
I like how he couldn’t find Any more bootleg crash bandicoot games but the shit was still funny as hell!!!
The real tragedy is you reminded us all Barnsley still exists
This is so ironic because I'm pretty sure that Crash was supposed to be a parody of Sonic.
Bruh caddi went from caddi to judge doom at 1:58
I've actually seen that Cash Bandiloot machine before. Can't remember what pub it was though, funny enough I'm pretty sure it was around Manchester.
You weren't too far from me when you were at Penistone Caddy! And no, it's not pronounced the way you're all thinking it is...though we do mentally say it like that 😂
Crush Bandicooth
0:32 4:23 5:31 8:56 24:53 31:21
My favorite part 5:30
Crash bannedicoot
Apparently Cortex's evil plan is to use the Shin Getter Robo 3:25. also at 3:41.
whoah you have a mustang?! I unload the new ones off the ships here, so if you bought this in the past 5 years there is a high chance i've farted in it
13:23 oh meu deus, Polystation Nintendo Edition gente!
Caddy. You been drinking too much dude.
I'm not a bandicunth your a bandicunth
I want to see Caddicarus and Halalmeat have an Epic Rap Battle of History with each other.
9:25 and Steam, ho bag
I always thought Wompa Fruits were based on mangos
13:00 in brazil you can find it too by the name of POLYSTATION
I find it cool that after all these years Caddy STILL uses Olly for all his camera work. That's pretty rad
6:46 PALOOSE MAN
im surprised the bootleg console wasn't a polistation
Just checked, the zombie run review is still up 😂
Almost 1M Subs!!
Well He's Back!!
I'm not going to lie dude. Despite the translation issues, that intro was pretty epic for the GBC. Now...if only they could have ripped a good model for Crash for the gameplay....or like. Some more Evangelion stills...
CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW THE FIRST BOOTLEG USED THE STONER SUNSHINE FROM GETTER ROBO ARMAGEDDON
14 minutes in and I'm like ah yes, I love caddy videos .
3:27 Is that... F---ING SHIN GETTER ROBO USING THE STONER SUNSHINE!?
That mechanical monster Neo Cortex unleashes in the first bootleg is SHIN GETTER ROBO!!!
I got the game at 28:54 to work it is the same as the crash battle game(a psp port of crash of the Titans on mobile)
31:30 dat BILC
0:05  Caddy’s neighbours: GODAMNIT HE’S BACK
5:27 at first I was like "hey! I have those!" then he looks up XD NO ONE TOLD ME I LOOK LIKE THAT!
Funnily enough you release this the month crash 4 got added to PS+   Sometimes Delays can have done happy coincidences
you couldn't find a karaoto because it's from mexico, not brazil (look for "Videojuego karaoto precio")
3:52 I swear to god at first I read that "alter" as hitler
So like...  Does the other Wayne look like Scott too?
thx for making me laugh during bad situations in life.... like being alive (the final part was a joke)
all NES games do that though...
'Halalmeat is taken', i can't breathe
2:32 Caddy has drip, confirmed
Oh pretty sure they had that puggy machine in one of the pubs in Sunderland (which is even more THE NORTH)
Lol 18:50
Wait, when did you say *“Wow, I’m jump! Just like Krash Bandi!”?*
32:13  - 32:18
Being in rural Australia I find it funny how he says it like it being a 3 hour drive is far
Crash 4 made it for ps plus this month
haVE IT GOD  Caddy's face 😂
3:28 eh shin getter robot
Crazy Fox: Adventure in Time is a *_T W O    C O M M A    F I V E    D_* platformer, huh? Interesting.
4:23 caddy as will smith
I don't know but at 23:04 When caddy said ''With great power....'' I said: Comes big booty bitches. only for caddy to smile back at me.
I didn’t expect to see Getter Robo in this video.
How many creative ways can Caddy put himself in the garbage?
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates-🟥
22:42  Caddicurus gets: Flipphone Blackberry Banana Rotary phone  Foam Android Thrown at him
Here, I thought misfiring a glue gun on one of my hands during Art & Design in one of my college years was bad enough, but for someone like Caddicarus to carelessly scrape his own knuckles off with a cheese grater is totally next level torture that even Trevor Philips would wince at the prospect of.
Epic games.... caddie is sponsored by the CCP.... ohhhh noooooo
The actual Zombie Highway was a good game, unlike that bootleg lol
#Unlimated_Internet_In_Egypt
We need to track down this Gambling machine for Caddy for next year!
There's one of the crash gambling machines in the pub I always go to in Liverpool, the Pilgrim! Great pub cheapest drinks in town 👀👀👀
Crash Bandicoot develops rip off games of his own franchise? Imagine what Spyro would do if he did the same...
Every Caddie video is like "doodlydumbum"
Whoa I can handle this!!!!!
EW HE WOULD WEAR HEELS
I hate thisssssss
What this really taught me is that I need a full 3 hour "Road Trip with Caddy POV"
Mad man really drove 3 hours to find a knockoff gambling machine. Mad props
The first game: Did you know that the "chicken" you see just before you see teh start screen is actually a Digimon? It's Cockatrimon. x3 lol  Also: Holy crap what the frick are these games?! O.=.o;; These are worse than Turkish bootleg games. O.=.o;;
The printer killed me
Your videos are so well put together and hilarious, keep up the great work!
That printer gag was a great bit
the 2random4me humor is getting real obnoxious in these vids
Please never change Caddy! Your insanity makes my own feel that much more normal.
you know what the whole energy of the video made me subscribe regardless of what it was all about
18:31 I'm surprised he didn't do a 2.5 D joke
Caddy should really buy a bandicoot
26:26 didn't caddy realize that's just PPSSPP?
The road was too full of DRIFFIC!! 🤣🤣🤣 2:28
I can't handle this guy in the video who acts like a person with 0 attention span filling every second with a joke. Just talk like a human and breathe and tell me a story without trying to make me laugh.
Had your 28th birthday? No ....stop being younger than me lol
Im Brazilian, but the only thing I know that is close to the Karroto is the turbo game, or something, that is a kind of super nintendo mixed with sega genesis and its controller has a turbo button
38:54 keen eyed viewers (like myself) know that car belongs to Olly, Caddy's mate!
I bought Fall Guys back in the day and I still ain't got any extra shit for it.
Nice
I’ve not watched a video in ages … caddi is still mad as a barrel of pants less Frenchmen.
PS
Caddy has a mustang!     Is it a V8?
Wif great pober, comes great Spons-ability.
08:18
3:53 is that kokatorimon?
Oh my god the glasses gag xD it’s so good!!
Crash Advance IV takes place on Trisolaris
31st Trending as of this comment posting, good stuff Caddy!
22:15 an Arabian in middle of a dinner eating halalmeat
ok spons lane is a good joke
Your videos are comedy gold these days Caddy 😂
Almost at 1 million subs... Dis gonna git gud. Early congratulations
Holy shit this was bad!
Actually not wanting to eat birds makes me a Veget-avian.
15:04 CADDI I THOUGHT THEY WERE APPLES!?!?
Ahh yes my favourite crash bandicoot character rashy bandaidcooties
1MIL subs will soon be upon us....Been waiting so damn long for this moment!
Pimche Cadi te quiero mucho 🧡
There's also Medieval Spon Street in Coventry, where Spon's ancestors lived.
Despite how bizarre all these games are the most bizarre thing is rons willians still somehow existing.
I like how he had an 6 hour road trip just to show us an bootleg Cash Bandiloot gambling machine
What a madlad six hour trip in the UK to find a crash gambling machine
For the Last Bootleg I must say this...   Mostly empty Roads? In England? As a US Fan I must ask....  Is this a Caddy Video or *"TONOUIGHT!! ON TOP GEAR!!"*
Anyone look up the game and found his review I found it
21:10  The Tom scream lmao....i'm dead  34:12 That can be used as a Pokemon cry
Caddicarus is like if JonTron still made video game videos
18:53 🤓 uhm actually this wouldn’t happen because UK plugs require the ground pin to be inserted before exposing the live electricity
11:33 I can't stop laughing!
Who are these people who can't program worth a damn littering the mobile store with these crappy knock off games? Where do they keep coming from?
5:39 I'm genuinely surprised caddy didn't get the opportunity to say, Cash Banooka with a bazooka.🤣
Android angry bird bandicoot legit looked like furby with arms
How did you do that affect two minutes in Caddy?
lol now we know that caddie drives a automatic v6/inline 4 mustang
Why zebras though? Imagine being one of the few mammals that can see color, living in a world full of vibrant colors, and then you look at yourself and you’re like “oh”
I hope you ok dude doing all that for nothing i get that alot in my life

You have a ponytail?! Why did I just now notice this!
I love the intro for Bandicoot Month! I’m sorry you got delayed but I love the video nonetheless!
Love ur videos caddy. Brown lumpy treat guy got me this time. Takes a lot to make me laugh from a video but somehow u get me every time
Can we agree the amount of effort and energy he puts into his is amazing
4:23 and 22:43 are my new favorite caddy moments
I should not have laughed at "Who calls themself Halalmeat" as hard as I did.
Look at you go Caddi! You're almost to 1 mil! Hope this is your year for the big shiny Gold Play Button 🤗💜
"Who calls themself 'Halalmeat'?" -a man who attempted to call himself Halalmeat
28:00 I'm dead bro 💀💀💀
Who has Halalmeat!!! Hahhahahahahahah
You should do a review of all those early mcu phase one video games!!
That Crash/Angry bird hybrid looks more like a furby that spawn from hell.
The printer moment XD 30:50
5:28
2:50 Excuse me, you’re gonna have to inform me of what an “unk” is-  Now, about the “Nobbly brown thing on a stick” part.. Does this mean Caddy doesn’t like chocolate?
M🤡
M
It’s June 34 now.
31:11 Kinda disappointed you didn't bring up the SM64 font. That was the cream of the crap
The embedded couch hair joke was super tim and eric I love it
Great video. Thank you
I love your videos, BUT this one kind of felt aimless. Many of these "Crash Banooca bootlegs" aren't even Crash Banooca bootlegs. Just because they show up in search results when you search for Crash Bandicoot does not mean they have anything to do with Crash, inspired by Crash, riding Crash's red rocket, based on Crash, etc. You type "kimchi" in search and I'm sure it'll yield random games about frogs -- that doesn't mean the frog games were inspired by kimchi, the South Korean tasty treat.
the printer bit absolutely killed me
one of the best viddeos i have seen
thank yo- “burp” UGH!!!
nice S2000 Caddie
5:26 I laughed so hard, also side note I actually own a pair of those for controller and phone repair work
Just when you thought that you dodged it.  Bandiconth returns!
As an Iranian, you triggered a distant part of my memory by showing that "Lohe Zarin" back cover. Memories of going to cd shops and buying ps2 games, mostly published by the aforementioned Lohe Zarin group...
For A British Man. It's Very Funny
0:16 B-... B-... B-B-... BANDICOOT!
Coddicarus is my favorite bootleg Caddicarus.
I'm honestly impressed by the time and effort you put into these videos, Keep it up!💛
3:55 It’s Kokatorimon!!
36:24 Wait, you have the blue signs designed for the Autobahn in the UK for the Motorways? But the joke of looking similar to the A of Autobahn and the stylized road with a bridge across it doesn't even work with Motorway...
8:25 THAT SOUND IS A POKEMON MENU NOISE
Omg the last pub I worked in had a cash bandiloot machine I still have a picture of it on my phone, unfortunately I doubt it's still there as the pub cycled machines often
So YOU'RE telling me, that I've watched this vid for half an hour, for you to then tell me that the last game was a gambling machine in MY town, and then you WENT TO MY TOWN AND I DIDN'T KNOW! Well this sucks haha
5:30 Crash after being stung by a bee
🤣😂
27.40 algorithm
The effort you make for these videos is amazing. Haha can’t wait to see what you’ll do next
Why is the king "Kokatorimon"? Ahahahhahahahahaha
4:20 i swear that music is "If i were king of the forest" from the bloody wizard of oz
OH YES KARAOTO THE TRUE ENEMY OF OUR HERO ZEEBO. BR BR BR
Dearest Caddy, I have a Crunchy Booka bootleg that you did not mention!  It's called the "PVP Light Station 3000". It's not the greatest bootleg, as it's just a rom hack, but it's another physical bootleg!
BANDICOOT!
I swear, the mobile app stores have no quality control whatsoever.
HE RETURNS! Huzzah!   I've been wondering where you've been.
Is it weird that I instantly recognized that one snippet of Lego Racers music?  ...'cause dang, I hope so :)
I’m going to emulate it it.. that makes me… pretty cool. Hahahaha
If you play Fall Guys before June 21 you get… oh.. wait.. lol
26:40 So wait. They took PPSSPP with the ISO of a Crash PSP game and repackaged it as some crappy knockoff? Bruh that's a new level of trash
That printer gag was brilliant
Eat fruit
21:10: The Tom mask was literally more terrifying than the zombie!! 😂
My birthday was on the 24th. Happy birthday to us!
If we find this ellusive bandiloot machine let the community band together to offer it to our glorious Caddy ... you have no saying in the matter you will accept it .
Respect for the 6 hour round trip for the video.
12:46 Someone's Tea is ready😂
lol
Brother, a 6 hour road trip is nothing my dude.
Man your content is super funny I know it must take long to make but I need more 🤣👍🏾
Duke Unkempt Forever
I love videos of bootlegs such as sonic and Disney bootlegs but I have never seen crash bootlegs until now
Almost  there to the one million subscribers milestone
I can’t believe he forgot the Jungle Book NES rom hack with Crash in it! Disney’s Crash Bandicoot?!
bro i swear i have caddicarus post sense because earlier this day, i felt like caddy posted something but i ignored it, and lo and behold, there it is...
This is A tasty Video after Waiting Uncle Caddy But what about another Bandicoot Month Video About: "The Interesting World about Crash Bandicoot Fan Games and ROM hack"  Of Course bootleg Doesn't count
What did we learn here to day. Crash's real name is Crash Bandi, and hes a fox
23:36
Caddi is so random-behaving and I love it!
Is that Crash iOS game bootleg supposed to be Crash-esque while also ripping off the Um Jammer Lammy character?
Why I'm watching this?
That belch sound is from a game I thoroughly enjoy cal terraria
5:36 This is fine
Wye valley skips caddy? Makes me think you live closer than I thought
31:41 yes i am Caddy
You're turning into a less angry Vito
6:22 Caught me so off guard and couldn't stop laughing. Cash Banooka/10
“Alter evil to be straight” In pride month it is (joke)
I swear the gags are getting sharper.
Dang poor caddi oh well proves the power of gaming nerds.
6:41  “There’s something strange, in ya neighbourhood. Who ya gonna call?”  “T H E  P O L I C E M A N !”
4:23 caddicarus dies: the movie
I’m very surprised by that Brazilian bootleg unique to one console, usually they get spread across tons of bootleg carts and consoles. I’m shocked it was so original even if it wasn’t great! Also, you missed a NES bootleg, it’s called Crash and it’s the Jungle Book for NES but with your main character replaced with a disgustingly drawn Crash and a few text tweaks. It is not good, but it exists.
6 Hours for a bootleg crash gambling machine that isn't there and *LOOKS*. That is what I spend my time on
38:46 atleast it ended somewhat wholesome... Ignoring the slime-
The text from the russian bootleg makes me laugh the most! Especially when you said "Elovie" XD
bannooca
Who ya gonna call, THE POLICEMEN!  Your delivery of that line kills me, ive put it back like 20 times now and am still laughing. Great video as always, Caddy. Hope you're happy knowing you're about to hit that million subs. It's been too long coming, well deserved. Best of luck to you, man.
Every month could be "bannicoot month" 👌
I'm sure "king Chicken" in the first bootleg is just  Cockatrimon (sp) from digimon...
eat fruit
Well,  cash bandiloot is officially lost media: the world must find that machine!
xD lol the Partner City BAD VILBEL is just a few hours from me and when i worked in the export sales we stayed there when we attended trade fairs in Frankfurt (also not far from Bad Vilbel) xD
I have a decent idea for a video: The Deathly World of Phoenix Games
"How many babies am i legally allowed to step on?!" .. OOGA BOOGA
Ah yes paloose man
0:41 , no words
Why do I have the feeling that the person that name the street Spon Lane named it after the mutant kite-human hybrid know as the annoying Spons?😓
The funniest man on the earth is back, we love you mate
*This man drove 3 hours just for us to find a knockoff cash banooca slot machine*  *He truly is, a dedicated crash fan*
I'm sorry you couldn't find that gambling machine but, the fact you drove three hours to find it is amazing.  And we all admire you for it.  Thank you so much for putting in the extra effort to keep YouTube from being boring!  I salute you, sir.
Hey your Next video cloud be you reviewing all obscured and Mobile sonic games
Nice remake for the b-month intro
My favorite Crash Bandicoot character   *DR CORTEKS*
Wow, I can't believe that the King Chicken made a cameo in Digimon World, that's awesome !
As a norfman myself (land of the round men) I'm glad Caddy's trip up here was worth it :)
Cad your driving on the wrong side of the road!

Consider Crash lucky to not have so many bootleg and rip-off games, especially compared to other popular mascots like Mario and Sonic.
I can't wait until you finally hit that one million subscriber mark. It's been a long time coming, and it seems like it's finally in reach.
Ppsspp, the best psp emulator, is free
The community must stand up. We must find the bandiloot machine xD
30:24 "Hi I'm Dory"
That is deadass the Stoner Sunshine from Shin Getter Robo at 3:27 I had no idea Cortex was a Getter pilot.
3:27 That ... That's Shin Getter Robo using its "Stoner Sunshine" (Yes that is what is called) attack
Ok, this really bothers me as a NES guy, basically, that garbled mess at the edge of the screen is present in a lot of NES games with scrolling, it's hardware limitation afaik, and it's actually not even seen on real hardware because of the screen borders, this was abused in Super mario bros 3 i think, where you can see same garbled mess when you move!
28:45 Do Caddy or Olly like David Lynch’s work, because that was Eraserhead levels of nightmare.
Crush Bandi: Fox Adventure w/ music by Death Grips i my new favorite game.
Cash Banooka? More like, Cash Bazooka
I know it was bandicoot month and I said this last video but  please make a Video about anime video 🎮 games
The reason why there are so many bootleg games on android that don't work is because they're all Crashed. It's in the name.  I'll go home now.
Caddy really went on a 3 hour journey to Manchester just to find a bootleg gambling machine.  This man's everlasting love for Carps Ban Oculus Rift knows no bounds
I always find it funny that places like Manchester call themselves “the North” conveniently forgetting that Scotland exists
I’m waiting for the reaction vids of this
Sorry about your ruined birthday mate. Here. Have a like.
I want those magnifying glasses 😂🤣😂🤣
not a bootleg but the gambling machine section reminds me of the crash bandicoot arcade machine that used to be in the Brewers Fayre (a pub franchise) near where i live
So weird having watched Caddy years ago, then seeing this and seeing how far he has fallen from god (not that much further, if we’re honest)
3 hours away in the UK? Isn't that like not even in the country anymore? XD
I love these
Caddicarus in the Caddy-CAR-us
Don't forget the hell that is figure and plushy bootlegs.
Here in Brazil they are so sooooo many of these that almost a kind of art. Specially if you consider GTA : San Andreas or Guitar Hero (the Guitar Hero ones are still news being made).
i feel like ive grown up with a hidden legend! this guy does the best PS vids and i swear its been over a decade now, i feel older than a snes but im only a year older than a ps1
Muito legal que o Caddi não conseguiu um polystation mas se ele tivesse pedido pra alguém do Brasil ele teria conseguido fácil pq essa porra tem em cada esquina kkkkkkkkkkk
Caddy I love you
28:44 made me giggle
É NOIS HUHEHUEHHEUEEEUEHHEUEUEUEUEHEHUE BRBRBRBBRBRBRBRBBRBRBRBBKKK KNEBBENSKSJS S SRBRB KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK BBRBRBRBRRBBRBRBDR HEUEHUWHWUEUEHEUEE
5:32 PFFFFF ahahahahahahaha
Just finished watching it, great work on the video. I unfortunately have covid at the moment so this video was worth the wait and worth the time to distract myself while I'm isolating
Caddy the family man. Very epic. Would liek to see the evilution of Caddy children in futur
In 2012, I almost died from a drug overdose but Jesus Christ saved my life.  During this near death experience, I prayed to the Lord Jesus and repented to Him for my sins and He saved my life.  Please repent to the Lord Jesus for your sins and then get fully submerged under water as a baptism to God in the name of Jesus and obey what He wants you to do with your life or if you don't do this then when you die you will go to hell.
27:44
Congrats on trending!
i remember seeing that Cash bandiloot machine but that was years ago
dahh dyes dthe dlass dlonedlundreddleightlydlife
Everyone reading this comment will be very lucky
“For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life. (John 3:16) The bible says the wages of sin is death. Man has broken Gods moral law and has gotten the death penalty. However due to Gods mercy Jesus lived a perfect life and died on the cross for our sins to make us right with God. “Go and sin no more”-Jesus. trust in what Jesus did for you…because He loves you.
Very interesting video. Thank you)
Living in the UK/Europe sounds so nice for having everything within some reasonable amount of driving distance.  I would love for events and concerts I want to see to be only 3 hours away, when I normally have to drive 6-14 hours (one way) to get there.  Because culture likes coasts, and no one cares about the central US states.
26:30 it's not actually a port. It's the PPSSPP Emulator preloaded with the Crash Of The Titans rom
Please come back to THE NORTH some day 🙏
😀😀I am youtuber 😊😊 😀😀Mera oddly satisfying ka channel ha🙂🙂 😀😀i need help for you😊😚 ❤❤nice video❤❤
😀😀I am youtuber 😊😊 😀😀Mera oddly satisfying ka channel ha🙂🙂 😀😀i need help for you😊😚 ❤❤nice video❤❤
its back!
Surealist game reviews are under appreciated
LMAO THE "KING CHICKEN" IN THE FIRST GAME IS JUST A DIGIMON!!!
3:53 why is there a digimon in a crash game
People just get used to caddy being the local crack head.
18k subs more and we get that Spyro review
Companies on July 1st: 3:55
Dear lord, a person from a small country driving 3 hours sounds like such a specific kind of hell. I appreciate the effort made for the joke.
Dude i've seen the shit you do/break. I can believe you did a three/six hour drive for this video
when are you going to do a nother grash vid
Pony car Mustang. Nice :)
Crash Bootlegoot
HOLY SHIT !!!!! IM SO HAPPY!!!! REPRESENTING PORTUGAL ALL THE WAY!!!! PUTAS E BINHO BERDE
It's russian
That video was amazing Spon Lane looks like a cool place
Oh good, SPONS is here.
The GameBoy Coulour
Stop MAKING ME LAUGH
Dig the new Bandicoot Month opening!
They may as well call this game Crash Bandicoot: Cortex á La Créme, or Crash Bandicoot: Créme de la Crash at 11:26.
I make entertaining videos
16:53 Has anyone noticed it says BONUS and not BOUNS?
32:13 Caddy Gets Abducted By A Child.
Thanks Caddy, for making my day! Stay safe, and stay strong! Cheers from Hungary!
8:20 they just ripped that sound from Pokémon…
You're telling me Daddy Caddy came up north and I didn't run in to him?  Love the video, every Bandicoot month gets better and better can't wait for future videos and Bandicoot months
Wow, when you are unmasking yourself at the very end of the video, you don't have your tattoos. Now who is the bootleg one?
Yay bandicoot month
Lesson learned. never trust anyone in the north
5:33 man is that a Meme image.
You should do more traveling! That was such a cool part of the video!
Для начала выручи историю. Как на бывших странах СНГ. Зарождались видео игры. И почему мы играли во все пиратское. А китайцы действительно делали дерьмовые поделки. Ну как всегда.
4:20 nah that aint banooca dat red plomber
I knew Android would be full of trash 🗑 lol 😂
You racist F!!! 😡
I have to like the video purely for the dedication to travel 6 hours across the UK for a boot-leg gambling machine that is probably now sitting in some geezers garage and will never again see the light of day... also for the dedicated wife who went along with the madness.
3:55 Isn't that a Digimon? O.o
8:23 I've heard this sound effect before(Wumpa collect), specifically Undertale.
The next video is probably the Spyro one since we're at 981k?
5:26 👁️_👁️  Damn it Caddy 😂
I should've realized...never drink anything while watching Caddy. It'll end up everywhere.
Omhg I did play Crash 4 XD  There also was Harry Potter 4 released during this time and it is the exact same game lol.
lego racers 2 music? random
22:40 best joke ever.
We are one step closer to learning Spons' origin
The "CADDICARUS BOUNS ROUND" was pretty anticlimactic but it was funny 16:47
Caddy your too much sometimes Im creasing xD
oh my god, no Brazilians on the comments? did Caddy break the cycle of Brazilians taking over the comments?
*“Crash, alter evil to be straight” may be the greatest line in video game history*
app opens and crashes immediately several times: ....... James: guess I can't play it myself: *looks for anti spyware for his daughter's phone* "this will be an awkward dm"
Its june right now?! I Didnt know
He drives a mustang?!
It’s not June so it’s “bloody raccoon fox furry thing……vol. 90907386384932692648363827” month
C'mon. You know the 100/1 console bootleg only worked because you emulated it. They always get fucked on the actual hardware.
8:02 missed opportunity to say Cour
*THAT'S RIGHT, BITCHES. BANDICONTH IS BACK.*
Ah yes, the infamous bootleg games of Cash Brandicoot
Do you think Caddy's neighbors are scared of him? XD
23:55 Wait a Minute, Hold On! is That a References of Bandicoot Month 2021 When Caddy Say Wow I'm Jump, Just Like CRASH BANDI. That's So Hilarious Man!
I think Caddy finally lost it not even 3 minutes in
ahh this explains a lot
Caddy...... do you live in Swin-done?
Sweet Pete is kidnapping characters to make video games now. Quick, get the Rescue Rangers!
i just got covid like 2 days ago so a new video helps
Impressed how Caddy is still hilarious after all these years
Theres a new peppa pig on switch
I didn’t get this as a notification!! So happy a new episode of Caddicarus!
Brilliant video like always Caddi. You never dissapoint!
I think that there is still 1 unity of Cash Bandicoot available in Fruit Machine World for £625.00
"With great power comes greatly disappointing knockoffs"
I was genuinely speechless at the Angry Bird Crash Bandicoot Furby monstrosity. But I wasn't screechless.
And now, the hunt for the lost crash bandiloot gambling machine has begun
I will never not be impressed by the SPONS sections Caddy keeps getting away with in his videos.
Do sonic.exe.
(John 3:16,17) "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
22:15 that's me
Praying that everyone falls asleep quickly and has a peaceful sleep. Hope you all wake up happy and well rested 😘😘😘
Praying that everyone falls asleep quickly and has a peaceful sleep. Hope you all wake up happy and well rested
Niiice
4:30 is so true
I died laughing at Caddy’s reading of the first bootleg’s cutscenes
Whenever I watch Caddicarus I feel like I'm on something. I'm not quite sure what that something is, but it sure makes the time fly. It's the complete slapstick comedy that I adore in Caddicarus videos. Love it.
He literally drove six hours just to try an show us that machine,  that is some hardcore fan dedication.
26:46 me explaining the lore of FNaF to my parents.
It's a goddamn furby
It's too bad Caddy never found the Crash Bandicoot Bootleg Gambling Machine in the end, would've been a funny gag if he did.
Repping Barnsley in the sign 😩
I was really surprised by the new Bandiconth intro. It perfectly incapsulates the insanity that the month has become.
"How many babies am I allowed to step on" *ooga booga* Such an enlightening answer, almost as amazing as *eat fruit* He should've said *eat baby*
Props for your dedication to your fans
Dude that is heartbreaking that you didnt find Bandiloot. You must own it by next year.
Caddy, slow down a bit. When you're funny you're really funny, but in this video the humor was... Not... Stop trying so hard!!!
As an American living in Texas, I find him considering a three hour drive "far" hilarious 😆 I have a very good friend who lives in El Paso and from Austin where I live, it's an 8+ hour drive... And it's in the same state... Yeah...
30:54 LOL!  P.S. Thanks for the Autographs at TooManyGames :)
heeey wait a minute. 3:25 looks like a screenshot from the getter robo armageddon anime. or maybe a super robot wars game
31:37 Yes, actually.  Though I might want to eat this one. Just to make sure it's really gone.
Thanks for the laughs, Caddy. Recently, I had some burnout, and seeing this helped SO much. I hope your hand gets better soon.
1:40 i didn’t know bayonetta had a crash skin 😳😳
It is surprising how many humans do not feel they have the divine right to experience an abundant life. This is so sad, when you consider that true abundance isn't something bought, or given, it is something that is shared. Till at last we rise forever in the arms of perfect love.
22:22 ah yes, i should recommend "Halalmeat5000" as my m8's Grinder username, thanks caddy!
Portugal caralho
well, that's not the brazillian representation that i want, but is the brazilian bootleg representation  what i need
0:17 my sense of humor is about as strong as phoenix games' reputation, because this is the first thing that made me laugh
Caddy nearly gave me a heart attack at 19:20
This man actually drove for 3 hours just for a slot machine
Krash Bandi, Supra Mayro and Sanic; the (un)holy trinity.
I see the brazilian flag, i click. It's simple 🇧🇷🖤
Caddie putting the Epic sponsorship where it belongs In the trash.
Hey Caddy, you said you were looking for a Karaoto, right? I had one, but here in my state we called it "Polistation". Maybe if you search with this name you can find one.
You know guys, after watching this man for all of these years...I think...he might live in a different country. Don't know where, but I think it's somewhere near Spain.
this is 3 days late
Nice intro
The fast-forward section 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Remember! November 27 is Bandicoot day!
Why does it look like Caddy lives in the story time animation void at the beginning?
Funny it’s sponsored by Fall Guys and that’s exactly what I’m playing while I watch/mostly listen to this video
I really like this channel cause it treats one of my favorite all time classics nicely and they don’t say it’s not a sonic ripoff
Wow. I just realized we are getting real close finally getting Caddicarus making the Spryro video :D
28:04 I love this part
3:54 The King Chiken looks kinda like Kokatorimon from Digimon
3 hours to end up in Hattersley 😂
Caddy celebrated Cash Banooca by sacrificing his Flesh Baknuckle
How are you going to be the creator that immortalised shouting 2.5D in your Klonoa review and then just say "two comma five D" like you weren't the godfather of that term.
3:52....... that's Cockatorimon from Digimon......... they really just used whatever didn't they
You have true dedication, great video. 😌 It's sad you didn't get to see your machine, but where would they take it?
"Mom can we get Crash 4?" Mom: We have Crash 4 at home *Crash 4 at home:*
Who names theirs company after a calculator error
Yes caddicarus video. Cash
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Brazil-zil-zil 🇧🇷
Yeah, I'm gonna need a clip of 11:33 on my desk by the end of the week, please.
Great video, I laughed at least, 42 separate times
Did...did Caddy rent a dumpster JUST to throw himself into it?!
I made it 2 minutes in.. later.
Another video from my Boi caddie , another good day
As a car guy from America seeing your mustang is really cool to see driving on the left side also saw the s2000 in the back on the ending bit looks really clean too
20,000 more and we finally get Spyro
Should have posted this in June. That's Bandicoot month don't ya know?
crash bandiboot
Caddi, I do live in Brazil and I can send you a Karaoto (or any other of the many NES clones that we have here)
What the hell?  Does Caddy have a Mustang??????????
LET'S GOOOO IT'S FINALLY BANDICOONTH
38:53 He's his own gift... *Where have I heard that before?*
The 2nd game is just that Sonic/Shrek game that Vinny played, but Crash instead
I cracked up laughing at the mere description: t's June 33rd.
13:14 - pretty sure I had that... or a different knock off console that only looked like a playstation... fun times
You can’t say that dodgy looking chicken sprite @ 4:00 isn’t Akatorimon, Digimon nerds please confirm?
😂😂😂😂
40 Minutes, I am disappointed.. Love u
Eat fruit is so funny😂😂
CoddyHasAGreatBody
I'm pretty sure that apple throwing game at about 12 minutes is actually a "rom hack" of the old aladdin game isnt it? That desert level and apple throwing mechanics look veeeeeeeery similar.
5:33 where can i get those glasses lol
“The Insane world of Call of Duty games?”
Ah yes caddy never fails to make us laugh when he terrorizes the world
5:33 😂 😂 😂 😂 8:10p.m. 7/4/2022
“I’m not chinese, I’m Caddy.”
I saw that this was good.
8:04p.m. 7/4/2022
Caddy in the mustang 😎 nice
Love ur show and the animation at the beginning was way too good anyways ur cool and I wish I was like u
3:41 I swear thats Nirvash Type: The End from Eureka 7... Could be wrong but it looks oddly similar.
30:51 i am deceased
Not even five minutes in, and the first bootleg shows in its 'story' a choppy animation of one of Mega Man X's charge shots, a silhouette of Shin Getter 1, and Cockatrimon (or Kokatorimon if you prefer) apparently sitting upon a throne!    This is gonna be good, I can tell.
Your turning into the PlayStation avgn and I don't like it.
*"EAT FRUIT"* 🙃
EAT FRUIT
Ah yes, 2003 Crash Bandicoot II: The Huge Adventure /2 Days 0.2 Final Chapter Prologue Adventure 2.5 Final Mix Battle Directors Cut Electric Boogaloo HD Remix Arcade Edition & Knuckles.
I'm only 4:45 into this and im laughing so much! Thank you for the great content caddy! "got in the druck and took a drip got on the drain" hahaha.. I'm deceased. ><  I'm enjoying going back through older vids and looking forward to more! :)
Missing the old Bandicoot Month intro but glad you’re on the mend man.
I never expected Shin Getter Robo (3:24 and 3:41) to show up in a Caddicarus video, let alone a video about Crash Bandicoot bootlegs. I guess Cortex's solution to defeating the pesky bandicoot once and for all is to vaporize him with Getter Rays.  Anyway, great video as always, Caddy. Fun and hilarious from beginning to end. Hope your knuckle recovers soon.
17:35 - anybody know the song? It's kinda bomb
Caddy how about for the month of terrar…ar you review the fnaf games and for next bandicoot month review crash fan games
I’ve never played Crash Bandicoot in my life, and now I think I have too   Also the Miserable world of Mobile Games when
9:22 the arrival 10:33 the departure
The absolute dedication to drive a 6 hour round trip just for a cash banoca machine where you funnel cash in the banaoca is just amazing
31:33 It's a furby
Caddy, are you sure you didn’t burn your knuckle off instead of grating it off? 6:21
26:24 its literally just the ppsspp emulator with crash of the titans XD
Yay its caddy
32:12 had me laughing on the floor lol
That King Chicken looks awfully similar to Cockatrimon from Digimon™.
Caddy. I've seen that Crash Bandiloot machine in a pub in Birmingham. Can't remember what the pubs called but it's near Brewdog. Think you need to do another trip...
You should sue these developers for taking the name "Krash Bandi" without your permission
This was by far the funniest episode. Jokes on point!
Okay the Tuba joke got me a bit
love this video, but also love that to the uk 3 hours of driving is “so far away from home” 🤣🤣
Ahh, yes. I've always loved the best month of the year, the bandiciot month: July.     Wait
I saw a Cash Bandiloot machine in the Velvet Coaster Wetherspoons pub in Blackpool not long ago. Get back up to The North and get it played!
Lol Draffic!
Its so funny that this is bandicoot month and this month should be ps+ members getting crash 4 abouth time a free too everything abouth this month is like crash
Cancel Baymax they're wanting to indoctrinate our children
Caddy is the modern day Kenny Everett :D
Geez, I hate when employees are full of shit when you ask them stuff on the phone. It's your job to provide information so please be bothered to give accurate info. Or at least just say "I don't know." The worst job to nod and say yes with.
Being reminded of Cash Bandiloot is prime bootleg nostalgia
What the brochure said< "Dreamlike WaterCity"  When you get there: DESSERT
Caddy there's a Cash Bandiloot machine in The Counting House up here in Glasgow on George Square if you fancy the jaunt haha
Oh my god he actually drove there. Caddi you absolute mad lad.
This video is a Cash Bandihoot
Dear Caddy: The NES's jumbled mess at the right side of the screen was a common tactic to save memory, and the mess could not be seen on the TVs NES games were made for. It's specifically only a flaw with the emulation since that isnt hidden.
Can we all just take a moment to appreciate the dedication of this man to drive 3 hours across the country for the sake of a few minutes of footage of a Krash Bandi game! Not to mention he has to drive back and probably needed several stops along the way therefore effectively wasting a whole day of his life just for our entertainment?!?! Is it too much to ask everyone to bow their heads to this man just for a second!? IS IT???
Caddy back at it for another video. Been watching for 6 years now. I’d DIE for you
Caddy, bless you, you unpredictable, unhinged, bandicoot-obsessed madman, for making a 6 hour round trip for nothing but an unplanned Spons joke. And for lifting my downtrodden spirits with another blinder of a video.
There's a Cash Bandiloot machine at wetherspoons ar Brighton Marina, was there last weekend
A jabbie making conspiracy humour.  The jokes write themselves.
Love the rugrats music!
I was waiting all day to finally chill at home & watch this video. I laughed so many times, like... how can you come up with all of these?
thank u caddy for this wonderful trip down the insanity lane, now i'm not gonna be able to sleep bc all i can think about is the crash bandiloot pub gambling machine
I've actually seen one or two of those gambling machines
that was well worth the wait, good job caddy <3
#10 on trending! Congrats Caddy!
34:54 I live near there and I go to that specific tesco! XD
The commitment you made to driving to find the arcade machine made me scream in joy :D
3 hours away? That's not bad. That's just a trip to Kenai from Anchorage.
Dude, your content is amazing. I know when I watch I'm in for some good laughs every time. Thank you for doing what you do! Keep it going!
15:45 That is normal for NES games. They all do that on original hardware.
And thus, The North has taken another innocent life. The life of Cash Bandiloot.
12:07 yep, i saw in a book about games that the developers said that wumpa fruit canonically tastes like apples
Caddy is really something special. He comes up with the craziest physical gags, goes to great lengths for the most obscure things, and slaps super high quality into all his videos. And that's despite the health issues he's been having. Caddy- You don't have to apologize for video delays like you've been. You don't owe us anything. Fans will wait for as long as it takes. (I believe videos should be fun for the creator, not just the viewers!)
pause it at 9:06
5:33 is my favourite part
21:10 I didn’t expect that loud noise there. Can a jumpscare scare you, but in a way that you are not scared but just laugh because something funny shocks you?
How he layers his comedy where not 1 second of it is dull. You think you're getting a bit fed up of him but the quality of his material & how he executes his comedy is pure genius. He gives me what no stand up comedian can do & he's like fine wine, he gets even better with age. Thankyou Caddy for many years of pure gold comedy!😊👍
I would like to see The Policeman in a future MCU movie
4:24 got me
ITS ONE MONTH AFTER BANDICONTH ITS THAT TIME AGAIN
That second one really do be like a creepypasta.
Every time I think I've found the funniest bit, something else comes along and completely blindsides me XD (also oh god I'm actually close to manchester I could see my town on the map and yeah sometimes that's a term of endearment)
Any kind of bum wee is shit but not shit. Shakespeare probably wrote that. Top vid😂😂made me laugh
3:25 exuse me I dident know this was a Getter robo Crossover.
This guy is the reason I still like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon.
Tune in next Bandicoot Month for Crash FanGames
8:40 "I give up easily" says the guy who got 202 platinum relics on crash banuka
If you have been following daddy caddy, you will know he cheese-grated his knuckle. How pleasant.
For some reason, 3:25 and 3:41 are both images of Shin Getter 1.
New upload lets goooo
I now want to see a video of the Cash Bandiloot arcade game and all the trials and tribulations you went through to find one that actually exists.   I know it's a pain and a half to make, but I'm curious now!
That giant chicken is a freaking Digimon hahaha can't believe they just through a random Kokatorimon sprite in it
4:00 I literally have a digimon figure that looks exactly like that chicken. Kakaturimon I think.
Bandi boot month
Glad your nuckle recovered!
Hey just for everyone to remember, Caddy only needs 20k subscribers and he will hopefully FINALLY talk about Spyro. Unless I’m wrong then feed me to Cashbanooka himself.
Caddy tries hard to prove he drove 6 total hours for a joke....*me laughs in 2 total hour daily drive for work* Work is the joke btw....
So the art on that megadrive one is straight from the cover of mind over mutant
Hope you’re doing well, read about your knuckles on Twitter
“I know none of you will believe I drove 3 hours for a knockoff gambling machine.”  Caddy not but barely a minute prior you were looking to contact the manufacturer and buy one. Of course we believe you’d drive 3 hours.
*Eat fruit!*
"I'm commi -- ng..."  Cortex.
4:23  21:14 7:57  26:21 11:03 21:09
Brazil mentioned S2
Number 10 on trending.  Let's go
The pub I worked in had Cash Bandiloot. I never thought to even show you it
There is a website called Fruit Machine World that has the Cash Bandiloot machine for sale - £625... and it's in stock! Like the comment so he sees!
Are you driving a Mustang?
That Aku Aku in the wallpaper somehow got me giggling like a little bitch and then I started thinking about the bit where you stuck a fork in the socket after seeing fox adventure girl and I broke down laughing
7:26 pretty sure thats what the crew on the god damn Event Horizon saw and heard when they went through the portal. libera te tutemet ex inferis...
It's July
Hi, where's the video where you tell off the "creator" of Cool Cat?
The "junk at the edge of the screen" thing is because you're emulating an NES game on a modern display. Devs would often use that space as a loading zone you weren't meant to see because CRTs would cut it off.
7:57 what was this? 😭
4:20 Why does he look like a fox?
You might be the most annoying YouTuber
Somebody needs to find that Cash BandiLoot machine and give it to Caddy!
“WHO CALLED THEMSELVES HALALMEAT”
you don't meet steve, steve meets you <3
The 'crashing bird' looks a lot like what Tweety Pie turns into when he drinks Mr Hyde formula in those old cartoons.
“Honey? The neighbor…” “Yeah, I know my dear.”
Am I the only one
that chicken in the first game is kokatorimon, a digimon. weird thing to see lmao
22:41 The banana-phone slayed me.
The only
F
23:45 Spit take laughing so hard after that bit.
The North is all the signs need to say. It's a warning to all & the original inspiration for George R.R. Martin who built an entire mythos around them after being stuck on the M1 in tailbacks for 11 hours & having those words etched into the back of his retinas.
This was a fun episode, you are crazy that you went so far to find that machine. I was hoping that the machine is actually there or in the end you managed to get a hold of an actual machine (I mean buy it online or something). But it was still fun :)
Sega have failed you Nintendo have failed you But Dingo Pictures havent failed you ;)
3:24 that's literally shin getter robo....perfection
Love the new bandicoot month intro
Ahh Gold old Sintax
For my own convenience lolol 4:22 ebola 6:41 the poleecemen
The weirdest part of this is living just down the road from spon lane
Jokes on you, gruntled is a real word.
I have a friend who’s a Caddy fan. They say their safe word should be Cash Banooka 😂
Caddimerican is funny
I am SO sorry you couldn’t find “Cash Bandiloot”.🥺😢😔
.
Was not “Zombies, Run” that jogging game? I think I used it, it was pretty fun
5:30 He requires a sacrifice of your newborn
33:19 Cash Bandiloot and the Temple of Treasure is one of the infamous lines of fruit machines with branded knockoffs of popular games/movies/TV shows. The others are:  Lara Jones (Tomb Raider/Indiana Jones)  Freddie (The Flintstones) The Winsons (The Simpsons) Route 66 (Wacky Races)
With great power.. zobies.
Juldicooth baby less goooooooooooooooooooo
Crash Bandicoot? more like Cash Bootnooka Grab
Hey Caddy, can you do a video about the worst Sonic The Hedgehog games, like Sonic Unleashed?
There's a M&M rip-off game of Crash Bandicoot if I remember
caddy getting thicc
Bell fruit has it on Berkshire in the uk
Finally, i woned
Again Portugal stealing Brazil's treasures.
This was an amazing video. Worth the wait. 🤩
Here in Brazil, karoto is most knowing by POLYSTATION, it deceived several parents
The commitment of driving three hours just for one slot machine is simply amazing
I... I had the karaoto... In fact it was my first console. My childhood was something all right, the gun was cool tho
Why does uncle funcle have mustaches for eyebrows 😂
"EAT FRUIT!!!"
This was funny as duck!!
11:49 SMH CADDY U ARE BRI'ISH U WILL CALL IT MOGA DROVE NOT GENEZEES SDIJFLFJHL;AKFJ
HAPPY BIRTDAY CASH BANOOCA, you 2 Jim!
I love the animal fact cards because zebras do not, in fact, camouflage, and I can't think of a single mammal that doesn't have at least some color vision
25:46 the weather when I'm on my phone
3:56 is that a digimon? Because it looks alot like cockatrimon
I need a full version of 13:49
died at "solid gold prolapse"
Man, Caddi seriously went on a road trip in the hope of finding one bootleg slot machine to show on the channel. That is some serious dedication, and also a serious problem, we're all very worried about you, Caddi, this is an intervention.
lol this was amazing
Pride month❌ bandicoot month✅
Hey I’m 28 as well
They're Wumpa Fruits!
How is that so insanely funny, damn Caddi, your videos are like the best LSD trip
I'd love to live on Caddi's street, just so i could see people react to the non context filming of his skits
dam, you know caddy is really dedicated to making his videos when he goes on a 3 hour goose chase to find a arcade game that doesn't exist.
but caddi-sir it says "GBC or Advance machine"  it takes away the funny sadly.
I kept looping back to 21:09 for 15 minutes straight, and I couldn't get enough of it.
I like to imagine caddi saw those jeweler glasses and immediately said “I can use these for something”
Crash II 2003 The huge adventure featuring Shin Getter Robot from the Getter Robot series.
this man really just drove all the way to manchester for a joke I gotta respect that effort
Holy Jollibees, this video got on trending for gaming to trending in hours. Great and very hilarious video.
Caddy, is that your S2000 at the end there?  Sweet wheels.
28:44- “Jumming, a particular type of agriculture requiring burning of forest to prepare floor for farming has been prohibited in the Madhupur Garh Forest from the 1950s but continues to be practiced in the Chittagong Hill Tracts."
16:16 is my favourite bit.
5:31 my cat when i bust a nut in the kitchen
8:10 The music changing after killing an enemy is a very interesting original feature I've ever seen in any game. 🎮🔥🤟🤔😄
Right, it's kinda obvious that the subject matter wasn't as easy to work with as Caddy expected and it certainly seems like he was trying really hard to make this work.  It's still awesome to get a video from Caddy, but sometimes maybe it's just better to scrap an idea and start over.
The "super Crashing bird" Crash looks like an upset, red Furby with arms and legs.
Video has barely begun and the first thing i see is a bootleg called "fox action". FOX. This is gonna be a ride, and not in a good way
28:46 what the hell is that
woah... the 1 million sub mark is approaching... looking forward to it!
I think we can all agree that not calling this "Crash Bandi-Bootlegs" was a massive mistake 😡
I looked through all the reviews on Zombies run and couldn’t even find halalmeat5000! Explain this heresy!  Edit: same image, same description, same developer, different title, different tagline.
5:35 Cash Banooka whent from looking like my Granddad going to the hardware store - To looking like my granddad going to the hardware store for COMPLETELY different reasons.   You know - because he needed to get a new lever. And wanted to make sure it was the right size.   To fit his MASSIVE GUN!
5:33 literally had me in tears
Nice Bandicunth intro :)
The lengths Caddy will go for a video is astonishing. Bless this man
All that just for a machine. Wow
I'm enjoying my 4th of July cookout in the middle of June today!
I cannot BELIEVE you came to my neck of the woods
1:12 I Love that he conveniently placed the game 'D' on his crotch.
The new Bandicoot Month looks like an official thing we'll see in a band a good game
4:22 "Now this is the story all about how I caught ebola and got put down" Would've been more flow-ey lol
Please, Halalmeatoexplain
That's completely unrelated to the video, but you are perfect at making deep and creepy voices lol. Also you ruined my sense of humor and i love you for that
Am I the only one who thinks Caddy looks like Will Wheaton
5:32, that I was not prepared for, this is why I'm subbed
The ungodly world of cb bootlegs
Yes they are apples. You get no dislike today Crappianus.
A 6 hour road trip for a Crash pub game is understandable. When I was 17, I once walked 2 hours down the highway to a pawn shop because they had a pre-owned Crash Twinsanity PS2 disc scratched to shit for 2 dollars. My family was poor, I wanted mom to save gas, and I just so happened to have 2 dollars. Analyze, adapt, ov-
8:38 didnt scare me now that its 11 something in florida oh god i got the time wrong there i fixed it
I live right near Spon Lane how have I never bumped into Spons?
“Anything is possible, if you try!” -Aku Aku, 2022
Crash 4, Its About Time Goes Free To all PS+ Subscribers Tomorrow. Very Fun
Damn Caddy flexing his mustang... Now i want to off myself
-Except for Steam.-
Gotta say: i love the intro for this year's Bandicoot Month!
Gruntled is an actual word
Caddi would be angry if I happened to buy the machine knowing he’d visit? Naaah I’m just lying. I’m a liar. Ha!
I see a lot of people share their lols and their lmaos but you legitimately made me laugh like a Hyena that's been tied to a diesel powered vibrator and pumped with several metric tons of  moose viagra.  Definitely deserving of that 1mil subscriber count dude, so close now!
We had a Cash Bandiloot in my local in Brighton until about two weeks ago, it too was replaced by a touchscreen thing.
We’re so close to that Spirow review.
I would totally watch an hour long highlight video of you on the road to Manchester.
Epic Games Store isn't available on Linux, so for now they are very cringe
His hands do a great star scream impression. Also is 3 hours considered a far drive? Maybe living in canada has desensitized the concept of driving 12 hours in a day to go somewhere
Cash Bazooka
14:22 And the Portuguese continue to steal everything they can from Brazil
Loving the new bandicoot month intro
Why do so many bootlegs call Crash a fox?
Hi my many is not russian spy, i would like to translate title card of this awesome communist crash game on mega drive (also sorry for my terrible english grammar, like i said im not a spy... yet)   "Evil Doctor Cortex kidnap Crashe's girlfriend - Tayva(???), so Crash could do his evil bidding. Crash - refuses and coming to save hes beloved..."
Why has no one mentioned the googly-eyed Dr Claw hand at 16:16?? That part made me almost wet myself I was laughing so hard.
lets go! new caddy vid by the guy who definitely smokes crack and has a beard the size of willy wonkas stick
39:11
24:37 caddy no CADDY NO, THERE'S CHILDREN HERE  24:42 oh that's clever
Even when we're talking about bootleg games, caddicarus can't escape crash of the mutants
Typos are an important strategy ti avoid copyright lawsuits
3 minutes and 54 seconds before the first mention of “Cash Banooka”
IV is 4 in roman numeral
5:33 🤣🤣
A new Caddy video about Crash Bandicoot let's goooo
Great content as always!
At the end there I forgot you live in the UK and had a mild panic seeing you on the other side of the road XD.
Loving the new intro, cads
3:54 that king chicken is a ripped digimon sprite of kokatimon.
Someone has to track down that galbling machine and get it for Caddy :D
Wow! That SFM animation at the beginning was so well done!
AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH MORE NEW CADDY!!! FLIPPINFLOOPPINFLFFLLLLLFLFLFUCK YEEEEAASSSS  Edit: I knew I was using my Dyson vacuum accurately!
man missed the chance to say it was made by a company called sintax. As in sintax error, because this game is a complete disaster.
When he miss pronounced vegetarian I laughed and I'm vegetarian
I actually played crash the Fox bandi before. I thought it was the "crash bandicoot on the run"
31:11 They stole the Super Mario 64 font in Super Crashing Bird
13:07 i'm from Brazil and I never heard of this bootleg NES, we only know the famous ones like PollyStation or DynaVision.
Amazing video as always!! Random side note but CADDY IS SO CLOSE TO 1 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS!!! 😭
“Sadly I live 3 hours away from Manchester.” *laughs in Floridian*
Crash BandiBOOT
That ringtone at 19:50 though, what is that
I don't know what it is about the joke at 18:50 that makes me laugh so hard. Maybe it's Caddy's smooth transition into something so visceral without saying a word, or maybe I'm just a terrible person. Who knows?
I would actually love to see more caddy travel videos lol
He should do Mario bootlegs
i think the reason no one really talks abt these bootleg games on mobile devices is bc there are thousands and thousands of games that are exactly the same (save for a few asset swaps) that are mass produced and released. i really think they're made by some sort of bot.
The printer gag was genius. I made my cat jump cuz I laughed so hard
I will never call a firetruck a firetruck again. They are heat ambulances now.
In brasil you probably have a nintendo clone insted of nintendo.
Feels good to see you back, mate
#23 ON TRENDING FOR GAMING
Anyone else never played a Crash game and is just here for Caddy?
Yaaaay, another Caddy video always makes me smile!
Wait i played super crushing bird and even crash bandi
I just came home from work, now I know how to spend my evening
Why is everyone ignoring Uncle Funcle's segment at 28:00 ? I swear that was the closest i've ever come to dying of laughter.
I swear I am dying laughing over the video about bootlegs on cash Banooca (Happy bandicoot month caddy)
I love the little laughs in between the script. Great video as always 👍
30:51 When someone asked you to do something while you are trying to sleep or work
ITS CSSH BANOOCAO
Caddy complaining about a 3 hours drive, 6 hour round trip. Me as an American, sounds like a pretty quick trip.
love you silly bandicoot man. hope your knuckle heals ok!
This is what happened when Sweet Pete got his hands on crise banana
He went to Glossop and didn't stop to see my Crash Bandicoot Resaurus collection... thanks, my son is crying now.
This man has his own unique kind of humor and evolves with every new video!
This video is probably my new favorite caddy video great stuff
You and Cerys going on journeys around the UK is something I'd love to see more of. "Caddy's Travels" is a series we need!
"crash, alter evil to be straight" i've heard of queer-coded villains, but this is ridiculous
I think you might have a new show on your hands, road trips with Caddy
Hi caddy, actually the bootleg console with nes ports have a lot of variety here in mexico, even there is a model of a ps1, ps2, xbox 360,nintendo wii, switch, and many more, also they have a lot of nes ports games, rom hacks, and they cost not much, like 3 or 4 dollars and you can find the everywhere
5:27 to 5:36 Surprisingly one of the most wholesome moments in this video!
100% worth the wait, Caddy. May your cheese knuckle heal, and your content prosper.
14:43  I can’t be the only one who expected a Temple of Doom moment.
I swear Caddy, never change! XDD  BTW, when you are you gonna do Soulstorm?
The whole Cash Bandiloot is exactly the sort of thing YouTube was made for. Absolutely cracking up
22:42  I know there were bloopers of this. We need to see them.
I received some rather shitty news last night, I really needed this masterpiece. Thank you Caddy! Maybe stick to pre-grated cheese in future though mate :')
I think the "fit for GBC/A machine" is supposed to mean "works on Gameboy Colour/Advance consoles", since that's true of any Gameboy Colour game cartridge, but the blender is definitely funnier
His fears of the machine not being there became real.  And so funny he complains that its 3 hour drive.  I just spent a 10 hour dive to get to my dads, and another 10 to get back.
Going that far with fuel prices being so expensive nowadays, respect man!
WOOOOOOO
"WHO CALLS THEMSELVES HALALMEAT??" -Spons's dad
03:26 is that... *SHIN GETTER ROBO* !? [Shin getter 1 charging the St. Sunshine]    oh dear, the image of Cortex piloting Shin Getter Robo and then saying the funnee word while charging its attack is..... cursed [but also kinda funny?]
8:19 Was that a Pokémon sound effect in the bootleg??
Bandiconth always gets me. Just... perfect.
Ahh so this is why Caddy returned and decided to grate the filth of Manchester off his skin.
btw caddy in 32:01 the candycayn conter looks like super mario 64
My friend had a gba game called Crash Advance 4 and the controls were A to spin, B to jump. It had long and extremely difficult levels in it. He told me his aunt in Saudi Arabia sent him it but now he has lost and tells me he bought it in Game and the box had Crash holding a wumpa fruit in the cover. Has anyone else heard of this game?
27:34 kills me every time
British people be like "I'm going on a long journey away from home"  Me driving 2 hours to work every morning completely immune to to the constant battle against time.
I still wonder what's Caddy's budget for each of the videos with all the stuff he breaks :P
BAND DE COOT!
You can actually emulate fruit machines. They have loads of games for them, be surprised if you cant find it.
29:35 That is a Baritone...
1:05 my entire life became a lie...
Karaoto is unironically an bootleg of an bootleg console lmao
5:30 lol cadi breaking character xP
Oh my god its the Shin Getter Robo in the first bootleg  Complete with the sprites from what seems to be one of the SRW Compact games
Really crashy video 😔
I miss long Daz. Where is he? I miss him.
Caddi please change the thumbnail to prevent an brazilian invasion
Whaaaattt ?!?! I live in Glossop 😱
3:34 why the hell is shin getter exploding the planet? What did ryoma do now?
Aw man what a bummer at the end! When he said they were changed every 6months your should have switched on to Games Journalist Mode and asked him more info........ Maybe Nick Robinson could help.
Is a 3 hour drive considered quite long over in the UK?
MORE CASH BANOOCA CONTENT FINALLY
Is it safe to say that Caddy is clinically insane at this point? I mean, that thing with the hands looks like the type of thing a castaway would do.
Hi im Brazilian and illegal
😂 HalalMeat5000. Hey, you do look Lebanese though.
Wowa
The glasses bit. Yes.
We need to find the cash bandiloot machine now
i never knew that i needed crash with a shotgun until now
Sintax sounds like a great name for an alcoholic beverage!
These videos have become a chore to watch, and  Fall Guys isnt avalible on all platforms, it was delisted from the one that made it big. Steam.
I always enjoy the jokes in each video, but my favorites in this video are the phones joke and the printer one!
Another thing of note is that it seems that Crash Battle Adventure (26:28) is using a version of the successful and brilliant PSP emulator PPSSPP, which they undoubtedly stole
They have a Cash Bandiloot machine in the Liverpool pub I was in last week LMAO
wake up babe, caddy posted
I've never seen someone so full of glee sticking a fork into an electrical socket as much as Caddy here. At least he got better afterwards, kiddies. You might not.
Wait a minute, Caddy had to drive north for 3 hours to reach somewhere around Manchester for this elusive Cash Bandiloot machine? That means... Caddy is... a southerner!
Close to 1m
Ah, yes. My favorite time of the year: Bandiconth!
yay more Crash Bicarus
The best part about caddy videos is those random caddy jokes that catch u off guard 😂
During one of the WoC streams, I remember somebody asking Caddy for a hint of what the video was for Bandiconth, and he replied with something to the affect of "There was a lot of driving involved...three hours for a joke..." I don't know why, but this wasn't what I expected at all.
Eat fruit Ooga bloga
bro ps+ is going to give CB4 for free this month
Все фигня, Кадди! Такой бутлег в России ты мог бы найти только в 2007-ом! А тогда уже и Гейм Бой Адванс, а уж Гейм Бой Колор стухли.
Checked to if that review was there, was not disappointed
11:20 Ох, блядь
This video was absolutely amazing and definitely one of my favorites so far.
35:00 How long have you had a Mustang Caddy?!
39:59
Crazy seeing Caddy in front of the Barnsley sign. Used to be where I lived.            Was a dump btw incase you were wondering
This was such as bizarre experience watching this video. Here i am enjoying myself with great cash content then all of sudden you're on your way to a carvery not far from where i live in Hyde😂
Juice Everywhere
Say caddicarus will you be doing a ubisoft video or gta clone video or will you make 🤔 a zombie 🧟‍♂️ game 🎮 video and i hope it will be useful and successful 👍 😀 😉
*talks about China and Russia*  *Shows a Crash bootleg game in Arabic*
Damn! Six hours of dedication right there, just for a _chance_ to see and verify the existence of the Cash Bandiloot machine!  While certainly appropriate for this video, I'm not sure if it would count as a bootleg, per se. It might actually fall under parody law in this case. Could be wrong, though; don't quote me on that.
I have no idea where you’ll go next year.
3:53 that's literally a Digimon lmao
TWO COMMA FIVE D
A bit late there mate.
10:52 Was that Antdude? Is he a sink now
THE PUUUUNS LOL
Only 20k to 1 million subs
Bro this was an extremely funny video 🤣  And Caddy, you own a Mustang? Daaaaamn, from the interior, it looks clean
Alter evil to be what now?
CRASH BANOOKA!!!!
with great power...    :)
Crash Bandi
It's July, Cady...
Why do most of these bootlegs think that Crash *BANDICOOT* is a fox?
This is amazingly funny video and I love every sec of it  x
The eyeglasses bit got me lol
Why are so many of these on old consoles. Do they expect many people to have old school Game Boys? Though I suppose you could also ask why they made most of them phone games that don't even work at all.
it is to much slap stick, it is glorious
14:24 Portuguese person from Portuguese speaking country rips games from a illegal console from Portuguese speaking country
I'd play that zero game lol
That S2K looks absolutely gorgeous!
I found from reddit that Wetherspoons pub in Blackpool has/had one.
7:26 16:16 32:12
Caddy I have an idea you could have a look at the most obscure games for the ps 2 and tell us what you think  Obscure games if you’ve heard of them then well done Road Trip Adventure  Downhill domination  Penny Racers The sims 2 ps2 edition (hardly anyone talks about it it’s always castaway that gets the attention) And maybe go back a generation for radical bikers for the ps 1
God, the effects in this are amazing…
It's bandicoot month bitchez
8:17 the wumpa collecting sound is the pokemon select noise 🤣
Say what you want about the other games, but 'Door Door' is a classic and should be added to everyone's collection. EVERYONE'S COLLECTION!!
I imagine it's never a dull day living with Caddy.
You didn't manage to find a bootleg one armed bandit but you did manage to get a trip to Barnsley so bonus!
Hey, now the ps1 knockoff is called polystation in Brazil.
oh i have that toster
Hmmmmmmm bandacoot was last month caddy
I love the absolute dedication that you made the 6hr round trip for a pub game.
5:24  Tbh this is funny and wholesome how they both just started laughing about this skit☺
5:32 Caddy I'd like that on a tshirt please and thank you that will be all
11:18 so i translated: Dr. Kortex kidnapped Crash girlfriend - Tayven, he did it because he wanted Crash to do his evil plan. Crash refuses and goes to save his beloved.... Press start
Mmmmooooooo!
17:05 it can't be bootleg if it's made by the main character himself, GIGABRAIN
6:46 hi paloose man
The driving sequence reminded me that the wheel is on the opposite end of the car in Europe.
4:22 NOW THIS IS A STORY ALL ABOUT HOW I CAUGHT EBOLA AND THEN I DIED!!!
Hey Caddy. How’s the finger?  EDIT: read your comment. Heal quickly.  I need more CONTENT.
Soap
22:54 lmao
no, i absolutely believe that you drove 6 hours for a one-off joke. without hesitation.
31:20 - Why, what a superb representation of the British people     X-D
That's it. I can take the silly puns here and there. Some bad dad jokes? Fair game! But "TUBA-CULOSIS"?!?!?!?!!! That's it! I'm done. I'm gonna find you, Cad. I'm gonna fly over there, hunt you down, and finish this charade. When I track down you and your family, I'm gonna make them watch, as I look you straight in the eyes, and give you the firm-est handshake you've ever experienced. You'll be trembling from pure terror as I tell you how wonderful you are as a human being, and how clever I think you are. And just when everyone thinks the horror is over, and things can't be any worse, I will give you the warmest hug possible as I leave, wishing you and your family the best. ..... and then, as I drive away, I'll detonate the bombs I setup in your house, assuring the world they are safe from ever hearing another life-shattering joke like that.
IT'S LATE BANDICONTH EVERYBODY!!!
The amount of fake nintendo consoles that i have seen in south africa
In my old age I grow wearier with every orgasm, I'm getting tired of it.
a whole three hour drive?  Poms
Yes in fact i WOULD like a three hour analysis of Crashing Bird for Android powered mobile devices thank you VERY much.
CASH BANOOKA IS BACK BABY!!!
This is the most random YouTube video I have ever seen. Nice one.
So I just got back from AX and after getting home and catching up on my drinking vids did I just catch a Neon Genesis reference @ 8:18
CASH BANOKA
Yes YES HE IS BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
And why is that? Your mum!
BANDICOO- 💥
This is pretty strange to ask, but can I get a link of that "Crash of the Titans" game so I can tell a developer of the PSP emulator?  Yes, they are just redistributing the emulator with a goddamned ROM. Uh, I'm asking because I'm a moderator, you can confirm 😑
With the undercut and ponytail, you look like your brother in law is the Avatar
Caddy has smashed so many phones that he can considered bambi
11:11 Damn I don't remember making this bootleg.
I used to live in Penistone can confirm the fish smell.
Every time you upload a new video I already know that this will be a good time, and I was right this time aswell, my freaking cheeks hurt!!!
30:50 Omg yes lol
Happy birthday Caddy! And happy birthday to your evil twin brother Baddy!
That’s a Furby 100%
I wasn't expecting freaking Shin Getter Robo from SRW Alpha to appear on a bootleg Crash Bandicoot.
Dude seriously broke 3 phones for a video. The amount this guy spends is absurd.
you should rewiew that wierd portegan website. I need to know what "Door Door" is.
Sven is slow
Who are you and why are you in my mailbox.
Ah you were in Hattersley! Recognise the tesco (and girlfriend saw the maccies through the pub window) only live down the road! 😊
When Caddicarus comes through Barnsley my home town and he is also a Caddick 😂😂
Buckingham palace guards when they see caddicarus: visual stress
dang bruh...........that woman on the phone was down bad for that. i have a feeling if you would have played it you would have it the jackpot. lol  but rotates them every 6 months?! i've seen arcade machines at arcades in the 90's that stayed there for years! lol
1:38 that's cursed and i love it
CASH BANOOCA MONTH!
Welcome to Manchester Caddy ☺️ Sorry you didn’t have too good a time here though!
I love your videos so much, all your little skits bring me so much joy
Sintax if obviously a groin cream that hurts because it is a tax on your sin.
I love how Crash in Russian is Kresh.
crash bootlickoot
Good video good lesson dont forget to call twice!
22:43-22:54 Comedy. Gold.
i’m so disappointed that my local pub failed u caddy, i had a sudden rush of manchester nationalism when you realised a machine was there but that all quickly faded into disgust when it had been so cruelly stolen from us
Missed one more crash android game - Bob the penguin a 3D platformer where you play as a penguin and can spin, slide, double jump, glide  plus there are regular crates, tnt crates, nitro crates and exclamation boxes that fill in outlined crates you can even make your own crash 2 style snowy themed levels and play other people’s on line. I actually really enjoy it
Caddi thinks a 3 hour trip is long? Oh you sweet summer child. Let me introduce you to Texas. We drive 10 hours one way every, oh I don’t know, 6 months? To go see my mother in law for about 4 days and then drive 10 hours back to go to work the next day.
Oh my GOD I can't believe you came to the north, To Glossop, And went to that horrible dark pub on Hattersley roundabout where I go to the maccies all the time, so surreal! I hope you'll visit again as a guest at a con or something someday!
The "CADDICARUS BOUNS ROUND" was pretty anticlimactic but it was funny 16:47
6:45 OMGG Paloose Men from Garrett's Funny Animal Game CAMEO IN A CADDICARUS VIDEO REAL!!!!
"The Dark Side of Star Wars games" we'll make a hilarious video.
"Play Fall Guys before June 21" Looks at the upload date: July 2nd "Oh no"
Cerys is awsome, She litterally get along with your crazy staff without even ask (at least thats what I see in the videos). 6 hours of trip to find nothing it's not something you do everyday without consequences. Thats support with capital S over there! Funny video as always, Caddy!
Oh wow you came to my local town of Stockport. Weirdly exciting seeing you visit the place… sorry you didn’t find the machine!
I cry laughed through the entire Episode looking forward to next year's bandicoot month video 10/10 GOOD
This was a great video with lots of laughs, but that Wario World Greenfist's theme at the end really took me back...
Wait caddy drives a Mustang!? Wasn't exactly that lol
Thanks Cad. I beat you with the best boy angel ending and I'm old. 43 I just turned, as a Cancer. 28? You coward.
I hope you have as much fun making these videos as I do watching them.
While these are still very funny,  the jokes are starting to feel a little forced lately. The accessories video was a bit similar.  But you're so dumb for having an iPhone, Android is way better.
ahh Crash bootlegs you say like Bang Bandicoot and Whallop Bandicoot
I wish somebody would make a Dash Dingo game
Dang, Caddy goes to so much work for those skits. Thank you
Should have gone to Arcade Club Bury while you were in the area!
There are dumps
16:56 Oh Lordy I have not seen that game in YEARS. I remember loving it. It was actually *really* good!
The Caddicarus Travel Log.
I feel like caddy is gonna have to retire bandicoot month soon cause he's clearly struggling to find topics to make videos on.
.... Spyro bootlegs next?
That pub segment reminded me of that one Phineas and Ferb episode where Candice does these huge trading sequence that takes up like the majority of the sideplot
Worth all that wait, you are amazing!
Why are so many of them foxes? That just seems an odd point of commonality.  Oh, and belated Happy Birthday.
HAH... Penistone.
I feel pride in knowing someone from my country was the one that allowed caddy to play that crash NES bootleg
He sure lives doing these in july
Another absolute banger video nothing but bangers over here
Be right back, I've STILL gotta finish up watching "The Useless World of PS1 Accessories" XD
Caddicarus is back!!!!111!1!!!!!11!!!11
FLEENSTONES
The motherfucker has returned.  Excellent.
in 25:46 i judt couldnt stop laughing this to me was the funniest part of the video
This really is the greatest day when there is a new video from caddy.
Everytime I see your video I always wonder what the heck your neighbor thinks of you, like: - Oh no, it's our weird neighbor again... - What is he doing now? - He's walking in a orange dog suit wearing pants and heels boots!
The amount of dedication to just play one lost slot machine that was vaguely crash themed is honestly frightening. I mean I’d expect him to check and then probably call it quits after he got a no from the pub, but he seriously went on a 6 hour trip just to say it’s not there. That’s either dedication or proof that caddy needs help
Well As a long time fan I must say that I don't like your videos anymore.  Your wacky and chaotic style of your recent video formats feels that you overreact too much and you put too much filler on your videos just for shock factor.  If you want to take that style it's fine but I still think that all the bashing you do to your old stuff is really unnecessary and has autenticity not like these videos. I wish you the best in everything but I feel this content is not for me anymore.
Alter evil to be straight, yes this is from russia
Love me some Bash Candicoot
That "tubarculosis"-joke killed me. I have now died happy. Thank you daddy Caddy <3
Damn, Caddy, I had my birthday this year, too!  What a coincidence 🥴
Literally almost stopped breathing at 27:04
Here before 24 hours gang
I love to see brits cry about Russia brings joy to my African heart
Me: *has never played a Crash Bandicoot game*  "Yes, I am going to watch Caddy talk about bootleg Crash games for 40 minutes"
just starring at the Kokatorimon cameo in the first game
15:38  Actually those glitchy-looking tiles scrolling in from the right like that are the result of NES hardware limitations (which also get recreated in emulation), not from a game running poorly. NES games have a very limited tile space to work with due to the hardware they were developed for, so they were designed with the far tiles allowing the screen to wrap over and overwrite stuff as it entered the frame.  Devs never bothered to fix it because TVs at the time of the NES didn't show you all the pixels, so those "glitchy" tiles at the far end were never visible to the average NES player until TVs that displayed pixel-perfect images started becoming the norm.  Semi-relatedly, this far-edge pixel cutoff area is why Ocarina of Time had that one dungeon entrance map icon mysteriously floating at the top left of the screen for seemingly no reason in every rerelease that nobody ever saw on the original N64.
Nice one! Loved it :D
The guy tattooed the Oddworld thing on both hands. Pretty sure he's nuts enough to drive to Manchester.
Damn! Caddy drives a Mustang!
New Cash Banooca intro?? OWO
Caddy’s a chump. I’ve driven way more for way less
"Not that one" [flip phone] "Not that one" [blackberry] "Not that one" [toy phone] "Not that one" [toy dail phone]
You’re mates with Cody too? I met him at a fish and chips shop covered in grease behind the counter gurgling and we’ve been the best of friends since.
Been a while since I came to a caddy video, I was not disappointed
You should do a Shantae series video or videos.
That weird fox crash running game is reskin of another game, and that game is a reskin of another Wich itself is a reskin of the unknown original. First it was a bendy game, that was the exact same except for skin Wich is bendy, then there was Ugandan knuckles, again same game but with Ugandan knuckles, and now it's a weird fix thing.
Someone needs to do a compilation of all of Stan's Phrase of the Days.
The intro was one of the best intros I have seen
OK tbh the crash titans port is pretty good given that it's free
I got crash bandicoot 4 it’s about time an the amount of times I have died is unreal and I have raged so many times
Happy late birthday Caddy
It's only just occured to me that Caddy and Jontron are the same creator and I love it. (also early grats on 1m Daddy Caddy <3)
Caddy has to get one of them Cash Bandiloot machines! Some shop called fruit machine world apparently has it in stock for 625 GBP lmao
Funniest caddy by far😭😂😂😂😂
The best part of my B day being July 1st is that there's always a Caddy video close to it and it's always Crash. Always what I look forward to most.
missed ya bud
Crash bandicoot 4  what happened to 1 2 and 3
5:02 now grab crashes mouth that’s a WAP that’s a WAP
its 1:20 am where I am and someone just got arrested
11:18  Doctor Cortex kidnaps Crash's girlfriend - Tawna, so that Crash would execute his sinister plot. Crash - refuses and sets off to save his beloved...  Press Start
Caddicarus must have a grudge against ribs, because he sure is relentless at making my sides hurt with laughter.  Also, the whole bit with Caddy trying to name his review Halalmeat only to find it was taken was the most rib-destroying joke in this vid for me.
you’re a month late, cidder
Bandiconth is back you conths!
I love how I'm seeing all these comments referring to Manchester as like "the middle of nowhere" or "some random distant town"  Like is the north only spoken of in fiction to you lot?
Damn you caddy, I wasn’t event a minute in and I was laughing really hard.
caddi does not know about the Troll Face revival of 2021
Crash would drive a blue Mustang.
So, they grabbed a digimon game, added for what i think that was a Getter Robo screencap and made it a "crash bandicoot game"?  Yeah caddy just bring me that barrel of acid because i do want to jump on that one *HEAD ON*
#notmybanoca
w video
This may have been the shortest video you've done in ages, but my God it was absolutely hilarious and so worth the wait 😂😂😂 One of your funniest videos yet! That bloody Halalmeat joke had me dying with laughter.
30:54 best joke ever 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
23:44 Ah Yes, My Favorite Snacks EMBEDDED PET HAIR  And 28:00 Uncle Funcle's Nobbly Brown Thing On A Stick
3:56 “Alter evil to be straight.” 🤔🤔🤔  11:26 And here I was thinking that russians misspelling Tawna’s name (yeah, I can read that) wasn’t enough 😂
The dialogue reminds me of Matt's reading of Game of Thrones fan fiction during SGB's Arkham Asylum LP.
For the 4th one, you shouldve used joel's goustbousters theme.
"I would do anything for you Cash."  (Sing Along Everyone!) And I would do anything for cash, but I won't play that
Bandicoot month isn’t a time, it’s a state of mind.
America's birthday and a new Caddy video... what a great holiday weekend.
This video in a nutshell: 7:27 , 16:29
🤍
Cant expect much from a pub from Manchester
THIS VIDEO WAS POSTED IN JULY AND NOT JUNE
29:35 that is a Euphonium, you can't lie to me JIMMMMMMM
I know this is about crash but cad?? With an undercut?? Looks hot af!!
I like this channel just that much more after seeing the s2k
imagine caddy doing a thomas video games review? (besides the kidstation game one) there are other games.
I really want to cut off Caddys ponytail.
Hi
Hi
I love 33rs July🤩🤩
I’m so glad you spent extra time on this; it’s golden - what’s a July???
7:27
Your videos always leave me with a big ol smile. Great job!
Do a video on the Twisted Metal games!
Caddy is always a ps playing daddy
Watching this tonight!
Caddy is in a permanent state of "Superstore Transition Scene"
I love your new bandicoot month intro
I was really hoping to see long Dennis make an appearance again
3:25 …Cortex’s evil plan is using the Shin Getter Robo?!
maybe you could do a video on crash protos and beta
Can’t wait till June 69th
2:33 Thanks Caddy, I will now never stop refering to Middlesbrough railway station as the Drain Station.
God I love this channel. First couple of minutes and I forgot I'm a raving heroin and crack addict going through withdrawels. Nevermind, they're back.
Mcu sucks. Endgame is not a crossover.
Caddy, for the Russian bootleg you should've checked if there is a disturbing "Game Over" screen.
How cow i was waiting 4 this
I was literally just in Manchester for a week!! Wish I could've know about the game
1. You’re awesome caddy keep being hilarious 👍 2. Is it just me or at 22:40 was that a dildo 😂
B-b-b-b, bandicoot
when spons got vacuumed i really expected the vacuum to say "that tastes like my mother"
23:50 why does the jingle remind me of the coco pops jingle
Never expected to see bootleg russian games in one of Caddy's videos. Yeah, back in the days you never knew what you were buying, a genuine game or... this. And localizations were another such gamble. To this day I fondly remember Parasite Eve II as my favorite PS1 game with an amazing plot, despite having beaten it with russian menus AND Japanese dialogue subtitles.
To non-British viewers: getting called "cock" by a bartender isn't as weird as you think it is, but it IS still weird.
I mean, the mobile version of Crash of the Titans is like the other ones.  You run around linear empty areas beating up monsters and you can stun bigger monsters witch you can posses and beat up more monsters it really is the same damn game again, just with a fast forward button.
20k Subs to go and it's Spyro time!! 👊👊
a six hour road trip one way is pretty short for me granted i live in America
So, the psp port boot leg is even worse than it seems.  That's just a Ppsspp emulators without the ability to play other games. Exact same ui. It's a double bootleg.
Thank you for posting this, I got covid right now and this is certainly gonna make it more bearable 🙂
Pp
In 11:22 just Russian just Russian
23:05 With great power comes great energy bill
😂 BET some weirdo made a PREGNANT CRASH DOCTOR APP! 😐 ....... what EVER you do..... STAY AWAY from the ANDROID DOCTOR GAMES!
I dislike your hair. Keep the quality content up 👍
Caddy keeps getting better and better every video
I'm so sorry for all the shit you've gone through lately cadds, you're videos are amazing and worth all the effort. Get better!
Did you ever do a video on all the racing games  about the “hot wheels” toy cars? Part of me remembers something like that but I can’t seem to find it anymore. Perhaps I’m just going mad.
35:20 why do you sit so close the the wheel like a grandma??
We are slowly building lore for spons. We now even know where he lives
I live in The North! Knowing that I am a few hours away from Caddy makes me happy
Caddy are you okay You look like you lost it
bigo live more like bigotry live
Yes, this a perfectly sane man who terrorises the people of Britain dressed up as Jesus, running around fields like a maniac and performing parkour as an orange rat and then dashing around the streets in thigh highs still dressed up as an orange rat. A perfectly ordinary guy in every way.
8:32 LOL that head tilt is so hilarious! He is like do youuu want this game???
HES BACK!!!!!!
King chicken is a Kokatorimon
0:54 BANDICONTH
We have the same vacuum cleaner
For Some reason Caddys reaction to spons is always one of my favourite Monents
God I have been waiting for this 🙏
A three hour drive? dang I remember driving 5+ hours for some dates when I was a little younger. I had friends drive 6 hours to see the first sonic movie in theaters.
♥️ u Caddy!
23:44 felt like a bit like a Kenny Everett advert sketch, and that has made me pleased
Halalmeat5000 hahahah
I’ll take spon lane over cash bandiloot
I could of met caddy if I'd known he was here, life isn't fair haha.
Cash bandiloot the elusive pub gambling machine
We need to find Halalmeat. Internet, do your thing. Bring me Halalmeat. Dead or alive. Shaken or stirred. I do not care what methods you employ, find me Halalmeat.
My birthday is June 28th!. high five for being better then everyone who isnt a june baby
28:00 I wonder if Daddy Caddy and Uncle Funcle are related? Is sponse their imbred child, did Caddie's evil twin "Baddie" come from Uncle Funcle's not so fun glory hole? I need to know how this family tree works.
Is it okay to be concerned about Caddy's economical state after all the purchases and traveling...?
I was about to go to bed but I saw there was a new caddy video and I thought...  Shit. My wife is right, I'm useless
Caddicuars you are friggen hilarious and have made my day. I’ve only been watching you for about 3 years but seeing how far  your content has come in that time, I still love your og content after going back and bingeing it. But just the editing writing and everything has made me love your content more and more with every new entry. Thank you for continuing to make this content for us. ( I know you stress all the time about the length between videos but you never disappoint and it’s always worth the weight ) thank you for more classic content 👌🏻
3:50 did they just put kokatorimon in a crash bandicoot game
holy shit a new Crash video
When Cad tries pulling the 'last one' thing 12 minutes into a 40 minute video....
I drove 16 hours to visit my girlfriend last year. Without leaving my country.
BANDICOOT MONTH!
Wow! The effort you went through to try and find that Crash Bandicoot bootleg gambling machine was incredible!    Happy (Late), Birthday! 🎂
18:29... What is that grey squirel on the left doing to that horse head?
3:58 Ah yes. That classic game where Cortex takes over Mars and a chicken king sends Crash to stop him.
worth the wait 😂
I think thats meant to be GBC/A as in GBC or GBA
So I expect the three hour analysis of super crashing bird soon, right?
EAT FRUIT!!!
spons has a mouth in a mouth in a mouth
i pray for your safety after making a putin joke thats putin you in a risky place
You make the anger sharks swim away. Love you caddy
yeah, i don't really like epic games tho, so i will have to drop this video 9 mins in.
Can you do a video on sonic bootlegs
june 33rd
Bandiconth is back yay
Pretty sure that "The product is fit for GBC/A Machine" means Game Boy Colour/Advance
I always forget that Europeans aren't used to 6 hour drives. I literally went camping over the weekend, and the campsite was close to 7 hours away, and I hadn't even left the State.
Oh Lord. Spons has a lane. God help us.
Good ol' Wario World music at the end
In the multiverse, there is a place where caddys😇 evil twin baddy👿only plays these cheap nock of crash games.
Someone is definitely going to tweet Caddy a video and location of that slot machine any day now
With every upload, we get closer to 1 million…
I don't think there is such thing as a bad long Caddy video.  We conveniently forget his super old videos.
Caddy
"It's in a pub in the UK" is certainly a helpful clue... Anyways, Happy birthday.  :)
21:07 (wheeeze)
its not bandicoot month without bandicunth, so im glad to see it back
28:55 i love that B1 droid wallpaper…
I don't know what you plan to do next year. Maybe you'll have to review that crash episode of Skylanders show you mentioned before.
Yooo youre so close to 1m caddy, i remember subbing back in like 2013, insane
Oh my god yes bandicunt month
Oh, goody. A new Caddy video to rewatch several times a month.
As much as I heard Bandi in this Video, how many copied Caddy?
I love your new hair style it looks great
18:18 that's the most british thing he's ever done recently. keep it up mate innit?
The trip in the end was totally worth it
We are close to 1mil! The spyro video is uppon us!
random useless trivia the background of the mega drive one is from persona 4. yes i do have no life
Sintax? The ones who make 'Donkey Kong 5: The Journey of Over Time and Space'? Makes sense.
21:30 Homelander after Vought
With each passing video it becomes more clear that Caddy has lost all of his marbles.......     ....and is trying to drive us insane from sensory overload...
"Who doesn't love Ballooins?" Well you see, there is this bunch of monkeys...
that's foam not a phone
crash bandicoot doesn't need to be stolen or emulated
Seriously though, the story for the first bootleg game is absolutely bonkers
Hahahaha this is great Caddy
I love how most enemies in the first Cash Banooca knockoff game are ripped straight from Mitsume ga Tooru on Famicom
Try to see if any of your subscribers have seen one of them machines
These long form videos from you give me happy brain chemicals I could watch you for literal hours
CADDI, CAREFULL, YOUR'E DRIVEING ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD!!!. ...oh wait...he's in britain... CADDI, CAREFULL, YOUR'E IN BRITAIN!!!!!
Caddy never disappoints. Ever.
Woo I can’t wait to watch! The intro is amazing. (19:00 I used to play this one because there was no crash game on mobile at the time.)
Absolutely hilarious video 🤣 I'm from Manchester, I think I actually have seen one of these machines 🤣 I originally thought I'd had a fever dream but nope this vid proved me wrong 🤣 thanks again for a great vid caddy, if you ever need help from someone in Manchester, hit me up 😁 was that a greenking pub you went to?!
11:33 YepIDon'tNeesToSeeAnymoreBYYYEEEE! 🤣
3:23 *BELIEVE IN GETTER!*
I can't 😂 5:26
Is that the Pokémon menu noise? 8:16
orange rat month
Where's Walt Disney's Crash?
Funniest Caddy Video!  Had moi Rollin.
13:04 i'm a brazilian and i had this video game when i was a child, but with other name, it was called "polystation" maybe if you search with this name you can find one to buy because i think the "polystation version" was more popular here in brazil, but i don't have sure if it wil come with this games.
that crash of the titans psp has the same layout as ppsspp which is the psp emulator i use to play persona 3 portable
Lol I love the new intro with caddicarus’s flawless cortex voice. 😂:p
YOO after gay month it's Bandicoot month ? :0 O_O kdksd
You don't need that karoto console just any knockoff Famicom with bootleg games built in will do
So happy for the deep expanded universe Lore on Sponce
That friggin' Tom & Jerry scream would make me cry laugh every time, and it still does!!! Memories!!!
Wait why do you have an inflatable toy in your house?
How's your knuckle?
0:19 i laugh so hard in this scene.
Dude, you could review a telephone directory and I’d watch it.
I was exited to learn you went through my home town of Barnsley, then I was so so scared that daddy caddy could have come to find me, keeps me up at night that’s all
Caddy is only 20K subscribers away from 1 million.  Years ago when he still did the retrospectives he said he would do Spyro 1, 2, and 3 when he hit a million.   I am half expecting now a massive 3+ hour video of every spyro game (official, fan made, mobile, and bootleg) ever for his 1 million subscriber video
I don't blame you for being late.
Quality as always. I can't lie though, I miss the old intro 😥
Super Crashing Bird is actually on ios
cheddar cheese is a flavor of pringles
You can tell that you've lost your enthuisasm, take a rest, get that hair trimmed and look after yourself, son, love ye
I've been waiting 5 months for this let's GO!
Bandicussy
Door Door actually ROCKS
2 videos in nearly a month? That's impressive for caddy
Caddy’s jokes and skits never fail to catch me off guard.
The look of absolute horror when he gets to Krash Bandi seems like it's genuinely serious. "Wait a second... *Oh God what have I done."*
Why does Super Crashing Bird have the Super Mario 64 font?
Jesus that entire first game felt like a bad creepy pasta story come to life.
Almost forgot about cash banooca month
Oh I needed this
Stan just said wtf
2:42 it means GBC/GBA
I liked the video before I watched it…. It better be good Caddy…. *fist shaking*
The Traumatizing World of Phoenix Games next, maybe?
*sitting at home with Covid* *sees Caddy uploaded a new video* ৻(  •̀ ᗜ •́  ৻)
Alex Jones said they were apples!! Well, give it 4 to 7 months.
11:19 It says: Dr Cortex has kidnapped Crash's girlfriend Tawna, so Crash would help him with his sinister plans.  Crash refuses and comes to rescue his sweetheart
Fun fact: Did you know that one of bootleg translations of Crash Bandicoot was called "Весёлый лисёнок" (happy fox). So there might be a chance those Crash Fox Bandies were made in Russia, but I can't be right.
Cash bazooka
Too late now but I saw Cash Bandiloot in the Wetherspoons in Birkenhead last week. It's been in quite a few pubs on the Wirral over the years.
Super Crashing Bird even uses the Super Mario 64 font
12:04 wait, that's not a genesis controller
3hrs is nothing lol
Ok UK guy. Three hours is not a long drive
5:32 I love the reaction he gave XD
Plz do a video on my friend peppa pig
5:32 his eyes look like they’re going in different directions
Damnnn Coddi is drippy
Ya like beans
that chicken in the intro is a digimon, Kokatorimon to be accurate
I really miss seeing you doing random things with is funny but this video is way too funny 😂
As someone who lives in America (unfortunately) I forget a 3 hour drive is a lot for some other countries. A 3 hour drive is a day trip for me.
Give this man a million subs already, he drove 6 hours and scraped his knuckles off
caddicarus is a road trip movie now
Now the question I have for that bootleg Crash slot machine is Has anyone ever played it? If so, what was the game like now? I'm curious.
OMG, Crash made Whoopi with an Angry Bird!!!
“With great power, comes halal meat.”
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASEESAAAAAAAÀAAAAAÆAAAA YEE BANDICOOOOOOOT MONTH.
I genuinely thought for a second at the end you freaking bought that god damn machine XD
Cheesycarus, You left the kettle burnt a little 12:46
god I love your videos
5:32 I find this moment were there laughing pretty wholesome  Very kawaii (god that sounded dumb but that’s how I feel)
15:43 that was actually not that uncommon even in licensed NES games. Most people never saw it because it was cut off by CRT overscan, but it's there if you're playing on an emulator or otherwise on a flatscreen that isn't cropping.
Waiting for that Train Station 2 review 👌🏼
The HD Crash intro with the broken Crystal at the beginning of the video was already a great start into this video ^^
Your Neighbours must love you XD
Everytime Caddy says "Chinese" I just think of the Parappa meme.
"I'm not Chinese, I'm Caddy" 😂😂😂😂😂
New Caddy video right before my birthday! Heck yEAH
Bandiconth is back baybeeee
I’m dying to know why that woman on the phone was acting like they still had the machine.
Can just say that the chicken from the first bootleg game looks like a Digimon that for the life of me I can't remember the name of.
Great video as always and happy Fourth of July Caddy, And happy birthday to
eat fruit
Crash BandiBootleg
So happy bandicoot month falls on pride month this year
On this day... I turned 28. I spent over three hours building the Thor's Hammer Lego set.
6:22 That poor hand
I love watching a YouTuber driving on the correct side of the road. Also this video made my shitty Monday less shitty. Thanks Caddy!
I'm sure a few people might have brought this up by now, but there is another Crash Bootleg that I'm aware of.  Specifically Walt Disney's Crash. Unfortunately it's just a port of the Jungle Book on NES, though it does in fact exist.
Rash bacoona
Caddy mate, are you ok?
Not even gonna lie, 30:56 has got to be one of the most creative yet simple things I’ve ever seen that’s made me genuinely laugh
Lol "six hour round trip!?" try going anyone where substantial in NA. 16hrs one way to visit family.
As someone who's been watching Caddy since the very beginning, when you said you drove 6 hours for one joke, I didn't even doubt it. If anything I'd be surprised if you didn't lol
It’s because you can make apps on Android a lot easier than iOS. That’s the reason there’s so many on Android
18:51 hehehehehhehe
Caddy continues his quest to talk about literally every piece of Crash Bandicoot content in existence.
As an American, I can tell you that my people would, indeed, buy something called Nobbly Brown Thing On A Stick as long as you said it was from Europe. Worked for Nutella!
You know it's gonna be a great time when I'm already dying at 10 seconds in xD
…..how’d did those boots fit you-
Yeah I’m so glad you uploaded, don’t worry about it not being bandiconth
I just love his commitment to break all his gadgets and devices, but somehow revived on it's own.
You’re not Chinese, you’re Caddese!
This has been a journey, a great one at that. Seeing Caddy grow from his skit videos to these absolute comedic masterpieces, it just warms you when you've been here early.
Love you Caddy, happy birthday
Uh nice, a new video, after workout it's the best to relax
We need to find that gambling machine for caddy.
I can never forget when neo cortex said “your god, I am” in crash bandicoot the huge adventure 2
3:27...Shin Getter Robo?
27:44  the phone snapped and i laughed, that was unexpectedly hilarious. 😄👍
(1:16) You don't even have to live in China or Russia specifically. Being neighbors with one of them is enough because I vaguely remember so many bootleg GBA/PS1 games of various franchises (Pokemon being the majority of them)
I was scammed, bandicunth is clearly over
No context just 35:27
That "king chicken" is definitely the Digimon Akatorimon.
Wow caddy. You said you just had your 28th birthday? I've been watching you since the start, I'm about a year older, and you went from looking older then me in terms of how teenagers look, and now these days you look about 10 years younger then me now, that's not fair lol
Welcome back brother!  By the way, some requests if you don't mind for what to do for the next video  - The Vs. Capcom games (X-Men: Children of the Atom, Marvel Super Heroes: War of the Gems, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes, Marvel vs.Capcom 2: New Generation of Heroes, Capcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000, Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001, Capcom Fighting Evolution, Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds, Street Fighter vs. Tekken, and Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite) - Licensed Nickelodeon games (maybe the team-up games a la Nicktoons Unite and Nickelodeon All Star Brawl) - Licensed Cartoon Network games (see "Licensed Nikcelodeon games) - Licensed Looney Tunes games (see the last two)
YES
6:44 Paloose Man Moment  Someone had to do it I guess
the wait was worth it, caddy I applaud your madness what can I say better said what can be said after all this craziness
Dude caddy that chicken in the beginning was cocketielmon from digimon!!! It was the spitting image of him in that bootleg! Lol
Wouldnt be a caddicarus episode without a concerning joke involving him killing the girls
3:23
3:47 Hey, its me! I'm DyerSituationz. (haha funny joke I just find it funny cause It reminds me when I dropped some bits to you on Twitch during the Crash 4 gameplay haha)
Why the hell did ‘Uncle Funcle’ make me laugh so hard lol. Glad to see your new stuff Caddy
Bandicunth us going into overdrive baBYYYYYYY
3:25 3:44  since when did cortex pilot getter robo
Crash 4 is going to be free for PS+ this 0:54 !!!
Eu andando na feira do rolo no brasil e achando esses console facin.
3:52 - Is...is that a Cockatrimon? Guess this world is ruled by a Digimon now. xD
22:08 There's no f**king way someone called themselves Halalmeat before you
That emulated crash game you played looked like it could have been a flip phone game I played in middle school
It's bandicoot time baby time to hunt some bandicoots oh not hunt dang it I spent $250,000 trying to hunt or crash bandicoot dang it (THATS A JOKE!!)
But did you guys notice the S2000 at 38:53??  😆
The legend is back when everyone needed him
I am now wondering if there is ever a Crash Bandicoot pacinko machine. Caddy could take a flight over to Japan for that if there is one. XD
W production
Is it just me or are his eyes pointed slightly too much away from his nose
the one line I'll never forget "crash bandicoot is going to steal my location data" so hilarious😂
Eat fruit!
Sadly I am also effected by tubaculos
I was actually deathly curious about Caddy's food situation, no joke
The magnifying glasses part was absolutely amazing xD
The absolute dedication is amazing
Cash bannoca the gaem
The fact someone got away with uploading PPSSPP preloaded with Crash of the Titans to the Play Store is astounding.
Your videos are astounding.
"That's foam not PHONE."  Why did that joke, of all of them, made me laugh the hardest?
This was really worth the wait!! Keep up the great work Caddy and happy belated Bandiconth
I have access to a GB SDK, anyone want to make a very horrible Crash Bandicoot fangame.
Happy disability pride month!
Bird crash is literally just a Furby. Lmao
New Caddy makes me happy. 4:00 That chicken is a digimon (Akatorimon I think). 5:40 he has had a Wumpa Cannon before. 10:14 it's a bit late for that.
13:20 you should’ve looked for a “polystation" lol
20k to go let's gooooo, this video got crazier than I was expecting, hoping for a fan from Brasil to send him the Karaoto
I always love the bouns round  27:59 the music make this better
Very funny
32:12 Caddy gets Kidnapped by Baby
FuCkIn bAnDiCoNtH
The best video you have ever made! In love

I was no joke having a existential crisis and 11:00pm and this made me feel a lot better
I want Caddy to do anime games next.
5:26
I absolutely love the amount of effort went into this one, and especially that dedication for the trip looking for the Crash gambling machine. I also love how you managed to get the real voice of Crash Bandicoot back for the clip at 10:50
I never would believe I'd say this in my entire life, but... A video with Crash Bandicoot walking the streets while wearing hooker heels just made my day.
0:44 You live in the UK?  America:
Caddi me boy, if you want to buy a Karaoto you need to search for it as Polystation, I guess the bootlegers really wanted to make parent's mistake that hellish thing for a playstation. I saw many birthdays become instantly sad thanks to that. And a little bit of trivia, apparently they were made in China, no one knows where in China or by who since they seemingly popped into existance at cheap stores and bootleger's stands.
So let me get this straight, Cortex conquered the world by building a getter robo... sounds about right.
3:24 Shin Getter Robo? At least the bootleggers got good taste in robots
lol "Oh! There's a cornflake in here!"
The sticky world of Spider-Man games
16:45 the Bouns Rounds get shorter every time but yet they're somehow always funnier than the previous one
3:34 STONER SUUUUUNSHINE! Thats a literal screen from Getter Robo, lmao.
I dont know if i feel proud or ashamed as a Brazilian for knowing my country releasing a bootleg console that has "Crash", "Batman" and "Door Door" as the star titles.
Bandi
27:22 I laughed way harder than I should've
looks more like a furby and crash combined not crash and angry bird
Can we just talk about 20:30 "Can this app track everything you do on this device?" "Yes" or "Ask the app nicely for it to not do that"
Gotta love the amount of effort Caddy puts into his skits. Always hilarious to watch!
Love the new Bandicoot Month intro!
absolutely worth the wait, as always lmfao
:)
I’ll be billing caddy personally for me and my husband’s funeral expenses after we saw 5:32 while eating dinner
5:31 what are these, I require them in my life for it to be complete
lol imagine being British and thinking three hours is a long drive ;p
Syntax gotta check their...  Syntax  Get it?
My friend Peppa Pig on PS5 when?
Crash Bandibootlegs
Why does the mask one have THAT many downloads
That Crash 4 GBA bootleg seemed really familiar. Anybody who’s seen Vinny’s GBA bootleg streams might recognize this game in the form of Sonic and Mario bootlegs with nearly identical level design, physics and music.
Bandicunth
5:27  It's already golden. Thank you
KOKATORIMON, IN *MY* SINTAX CRASH BANDICOOT GAME!?  Ah, good old Sintax. . . they also made some of my favorite bootleg Pokemon games (and a Digimon one as well) that are basically reskins of super jank Fire Emblem on Game Boy. It's nice to know they also made shoddy Engrish Crash Bandicoot games instead of staying in one lane lol.
Hey.  20k left until our Spyro Trilogy Review Caddy  💕💕💕 The love is growing!
Right on my birthday, thanks Caddy!
You used a Euphonium instead of a Tuba. 😂
Portugal FTW, for once...
Coincidentally today Crash 4 was announced as this months free PS+ game
16:15 Don't worry. There is MUUUUH.
Csh Banoola.
15:51
Fingers crossed for cartoon Network games in October
SHIN GETTER ROBO STONER SUNSHINE AT 3:24 ?????
Did anyone said BRAZIL? 13:11 come to BRAZIL Caddy or else im going to take you by force hue hue😅😅 love your channel dude.
5:31 HOLY SH1T THOSE GOGGLES ARE CURSED.
oh yeah, furby banooka
Hey, how about a video on: the hidden world of hidden gems, (yes I know not very origninal but I dont care) the premise is simple, games that are very good, but for one reason or another they got left behind in video game history. One I will recommend to you is urban chaos, riot response. Hope you will read this.
3 hours and you're still in Jersey, man, I don't see what you're complaining about
loving the new bandiconth intro
LMAO 30 coming real quick bro. Trust me when the 2000's babies are 30 then I'll feel old
I had given up on getting a bandicoot month video.
I was depressed, then caddy uploaded and my depression was cured!
Pftttt not even a month in and I'm dying of laughter
We are getting real close to finally getting a spyro video, only 20k more great job caddy
Caddy’s ending gag just reminds me of Michael reeves video where he drove across the states so his robot dog could piss on Boston dynamics AND NOTHING ELSE
Hey Caddi, try searching for a *polystation*. Its literally the same ps1-nes bootleg bullshittery but i don't remember the games And yes, its also Brazilian ¯\_( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)_/¯ Also, its easier to find.
More Cody.
Not gonna lie, Caddy was getting pretty violated by the LOOKS of people meeting Mr. Banooca himself walking in the place (Only people who actually knows about Caddicarus)
I lub Brash Khaki
5:24 Cash Banooca? More like Cash *_BAZOOKA_* (Sorry other two replies had typos and my mobile browser doesn’t let me edit comments)
Caddy im starting to worry for your mental health  Added note: I pulled a muscle laughing
I couldn't help but notice the S2000 in the driveway. Very nice
YAY UNHINGED CONTENT
This ciideo makes me veryhappy
Ok, so here's me putting the time stamps for Caddy jokes that made me laugh uncontrollably for some unexplainable reason.  38:58.
25:48 😂 the game CRASHed!! 🤣
Caddy: "I know that none of you will believe I drove 3 hours just for a slot machine." Fans: "That's not even the dumbest thing you've done for a video this year."
Spons lore
Welp knockoff games suck I really have a history with these games/consoles.
I love how there was a solid 20 minutes of nothing having to do with crash bandicoot and you just looked at random knockoff games. Like seriously? Are you afraid of making your videos less than 40 minutes long to the point where there's just content that has nothing to do with the topic in the middle of it? I gotta say, I feel like you're just phoning it in now. Shame because I've been a fan for a while
26:23 Wait... That's just ppsspp🗿
Next time you go on a 6-hour round trip, EAT FRUIT!
The games that arent loading were probably made for older phones with a different resolution. When i have this issue; i open the app in window mode and that normally fixes it
Where did Caddy get a euphonium/baritone from? One of his daughters?
Hot damn at 3:23 Shin Getter doing Stoner Sunshine
1:04 I love how just put Conker on there
“With great power…” - Sir Issac Newton
We have this machine in my local weatherspoons in minehead, the duke of wellington 😂
King Chicken: "Crash, alter evil to be straight!" Crash: "What?! I didn't know you were an indoctrinated Christian conservative!"
Im early
Well, looks like i'll have to wait 'till next year for the Developer Time Trials video, if he does that at all...
the 3rd android game is just the PPSSPP Emulator
3:51 hold up is that a Kokatorimon from Digimon?
I love how the designs of Crash in bootleg form range from misshapen goblin, *BiRd,* and (in the case of Bandiloot) someone's horny Deviantart OC.
Why does "Super Crashing Bird" look like a pissed off Furby with arms
Well, Crash Birdacoot is definitely my next tattoo
In this video a british man treats a 3h drive like it's something big, lmao
21:03 That’s not a machine gun, that’s Crash with his Ringo Bazooka.
Brilliant job man! I'm always pumped when I see a new video posted on the channel. Good job on the editing, very entertaining!
30:50 is going in my rotation of reaction gifs
CASH BANOCAAAAAAAAAA,!!!
1:23 quem achar o Bomba Patch dá like
Caddi, we love all the work you put into these videos. As an American, though, it's kind of funny to hear someone say "ugh, a three hour drive" because that's like a quarter of the way across your entire country.
Haa! 10 seconds and i'm already laughing, Thank You good Sir. 😄👍
Karaoto no Brasil? Acho que não, porque nunca vi isso. Aliás, a página do Facebook tá em Espanhol e não PTBR então acho ainda mais sus  (Comentario em BR porque mencionou Brasil)
Ah yes claus beluga
Big love from The North, Caddy!
I can confirm that, yes, it does push you backwards. But like. A very very small amount.
Your videos are what makes my days the best
Birthday boy when this video was uploaded!
I honor and respect Caddy's commitment to drive all the way across England just for a game.
Space Hamster vibes here...
3:46 So you're telling me in the bootleg universe, Cash Banooca believes in Getter?! Y'know what, I'm okay with that.
WOOOOOOO WAKE UP HONEY NEW CADDY UPLOAD! WE MISSED YA MAN!
BACK AGAIN EH? IAN NEILL ME LOVES U!!!!!! Also, bootlegs for Bandicoots aren't so special if they're Bandicoots themselves.
I’m impressed how Caddy is still hilarious after all these years. Almost choked on my food laughing
18:49-18:55 I was not expecting that 😂🤣😂
That lady on the phone was likely all "Oh yeah, yeah! We've got it!" just to lure a potential new customer for her monthly quota or whatever :<
Loved the new intro and the new caddy hijinx
To see a man travel far and wide for his beloved bandicoot and have his girlfriend risk food poisoning from a reduced M&S Salad, only for it to amount for nothing. It's just like Nelson Fox said, "Middle Class is Magical."
There was this one YouTuber I watched called CaptainSauce and I swear he played 5 other versions of "Crash the Fox Bandi" where the only difference was the character you control.
HOW ARE YOU SO FUNNY SO CONSISTENTLY?!?
I didn't even thou that Cash Banocca has his own rip off, bootlegs games from different countries XD
Just one comment for the algorithm, keep up the great work james!
30:52 My favourite joke in the whole video. Thank you Caddy for putting in some much effort for these batshit insane videos
Don’t you hate when your dad comes into your room, takes your foam, downloads a bunch of kash bunuki bootlegs, breaks it, and gives it back???
5:48 crash bazooka
Soooooo great!! Glad you’re well
This might be one of your funniest videos! Great job!
30:00 I’ve played a game that is exactly the same except instead of crash the fox bandi (or v2 bandi) it was Uganda knuckles and 90% of the sound effects and music were replaced by Uganda knuckles noises.
After this month is over he should really review beat mania
Since when does Caddy drive a Mustang? That’s pretty cool
There's a dead meme among Us
Caddy: “You are probably thinking I would never drive 3+ hours just for a joke.” Me: “It’s Bandicoot Month. Rules and logic stop applying during Bandicoot Month.”
Well, you at least got a potential tax write off for your trip... I guess... Idk how England taxes work in relation to US tax law...
7:28
So, caddi drives a mustang, which really made me want to unsubscribe. But then I saw the s2000 at the end of the video and I forgave him.
Cool Bandicoot Month intro
1:06 i honestly thought that was an actual wall.
God damm been waiting FOREVER for a NEW CADDY video! love this guy!!  n just like his Sister Rosie he be FUCKIN HILARIOUS n ofcource TREMENDOUS!!!
Man,this video was awesome!
Giant chicken is a kokatorimon from digimon.
Alright internet, let's find that gambling machine.
there's just something real amazing about watching caddicarus when you're on your 3rd dose of dayquil for the day
Cornflake
the logical follow up to pride month
I want to die
As someone who lives in Manchester id like to apologize for you having to enter the area 😂
It seems caddy has finally relearned the art of not diving head first into hour long subjects.
I knew he'd say bandiconth and I still popped off
Eat fruit!
If my lack of brain cells wasn't already obvious, it took me until just now, two years later, to realize that the "reviewing tons of games in one video" thing was, in fact, not just a change of pace, but instead the new permanent format for Caddy's channel. I am supremely stupid.
Happy bandiconth
I think i recognise that service point. Huh.
I'm from Brazil and I played some of these bootleg games lol specially the racing one!
WOOO!
tom my boy.21:10
Happy birthday 🎉 Caddicarus
Well if it makes you feel any better, people in the states drive 3 hrs just for shits and giggles. I used to drive 3 and a half just to go shopping on the weekend🙄
Hope your hand heals soon
Caddy: 3 hours is such a long drive Americans and Russians driving 2 hours to work every day and up to 10 hours to visit another city: 🗿 Still, the dedication to the bit is admirable! I love Caddy's humor so much, it tickles right in my brain's armpit!
11:27 Is this a bad Rule 34? Is this where Nina came from??
That super crashing bird character actually looks like a Furby.
Gotta appreciate how the crash advance series doesn't believe in odd numbers, where there's only 2 and 4
You know you made it when you have the Chinese making bootlegs of you.
The fact none of these bootleggers thought to name their thing 'Cash Banooca', smh
I can’t believe he drove all the way for a Cash Bandiloot machine and then it’s not there!
Okay but Caddy is looking like a snack in this video
Only 20k subs left until we make Caddy suffer and cover Spyro.
Cash Banoocaloot!
I love the evil hand bootlegger
Caddy. I love you but I'm OCD so help me. Why when they mistakenly spelled treasure as jreasure why did you make a bunch of d-based misspellings rather than j-based? It's important I gotta know!  Also I think GBC/A means game boy color / advance.   Respectfully, a guy who can't just enjoy jokes
Victoria Plum? Poor Karl...
Do I dare try to search what "Jum" is? ... Yes I do.
38:54 Is that a Honda S2000?
"I live 3 hours away from Manchester"  I'm so American. 3 hours of driving is nothing to me...
Holy shucks, for once, it is actually my birthday!
Alpharad should make the 'Not Bandicoot' series.
gotta hand it to caddy always goes the extra mile for the videos dont ever change
honestly with the console, your best bet is knowing someone in brazil, i have a friend in brazil who i’ve gotten a few brazilian items from via having him order from a brazil only shopping site
That ending!
Neat.
HONEY WAKE UP BANDICOOT JESUS HAS RETURNED.
That opening SFM animation was great
“Crash, alter evil to be straight” may be the greatest line in video game history
I’m really surprised you didn’t talk about bootleg crash merch like fake crash and the such
29:32 nice Euphonium Caddy
That Crash bird game was somehow the best Crash bootleg game....which is a really low bar  and was still disappointing
The 8 bit crash lil sprit is cute
YEPH HE’MVE BACK
Oh geez! The voice at 16:17 reminds me of another Naughty Dog character! I’m surprised the reference wasn’t made…  “Present to me 120 Precursor Orbs for each Power Cell I contain.”
3:56 in and I’ve come across the statement “alter evil to be straight.” Is Crash going to try converting Cortex? Because that sounds like a terrifying process.
..well at least I know of two of th3se
So we're just not going to acknowledge Shin Getter Robo in that first game, are we?
I’m starting to wonder why Caddy has so many creatures just around him and in his house. It’s like he has his own SCP foundation in his house. That or he is an SCP. Either or. Anyway great video Cads!
3:54 - that would be Kakatorimon
The Chicken in the first game looks like the Digimon, Kokatarimon. Is this a Chinese Crash/Digimon cross over ?
Crash in Doom (but the instruments are WHOA)
The Golden Prolapse, an Exclusive Club for The Discerning Gentlefolk
PLEASE go back to game reviews. Syphon Filter maybe.
Takonel
The talking hand face bit had me giggling so much! XD
They missed an opportunity to make him a pothead and call him "Hash Bandicoot"
We call that ps1 clone ''Polystation'' here
Can I just take a moment to say that everything, especially the production value in Caddy's videos just keeps getting better and better with every video? One of the few content creators that I genuinely drop what I'm doing and watch the video. .
I blame the cheese grater
We ignoring the free toaster bit?
In this video Caddy heartlessly murders his stepchildren.
I can't wait to get to play the crash games on my PC with gamepass.
Thats actually cockatricemon
Nice
Do you ever just wonder what it’s like to be caddy’s neighbour
Meanwhile I found the cash bandiloot in a skegness pub lmao.
cash banooka 🤤
Every CB game after CTR is a bootleg if you think about it.
22:14 since I'm a Muslim, I'll take this username
I'm in awe and terror at the fact that Caddy so comfortably shatters and breaks so many phones, often with his bare hands, as often as he does in this video. Caddy is basically me whenever my MacBook starts having troubles doing anything, I just want to go full caveman and break it to pieces with my hands.
Thx Caddie for making my day every time u post. Also cash bandiloot 😂
5:29 You know Caddy loves making videos when he can’t hold in his laughter during recording 👏👏
"Thats foam, not a phone"  -Caddicarus
You know, I would be surprised if you didn't take a 6 hour round trip to find a single gambling machine for one joke, and then not find it because the phone lady was a liar.
3:53 I loved it when cockatricemon from Digimon met crash
You kidding how is crash of the titans psp with fast forward is bad just hilarious to see
Is anyone else a bit concerned that Daddy Caddy might be a bit mentally disturbed?  But seriously, every month is Bandicounth!
caddy knows how to put a smile on my face every time
The story for the gambling machine really is impressive, Caddy's love for Crash is something I've only seen in movies
Remember Everyone, Eat Fruit!
WOW! YOU ARE JUNP! JSUT LIKE CR-       ASH BANYD!!!
HAPPY LATE BIRTHDAY CADDICARUS!!!!!!!!!!!!
leave it to the british to think 3 hours is a far drive
That last game. OH BOY that took some serious dedication, bravo Mr Cadd of Icarus.
28:47 That thing is beyond disturbing...
2:50 and yes we finally have the Bad ZeroWing Crash translation.  "ALL YOUR BANDICOOTS ARE BELONG TO US"  Brilliant, chief
June baby checking in! Also 28!
Come for the bootlegs, stay for the absolute chaos.
Amazing video as always! Just a correction: Karaoto is similar to the Polystation, a brazilian bootleg, but Karaoto itself had nothing to do with Brazil. The box is in spanish and the webpage point to Ciudad de Mexico 😅
Get you a girl who will accompany you to a 6 hours road trip just for some obscure bootleg of the orange rat. Cerys is the GOAT.
An optician sees what happens at 5:32 on a daily basis.
26:26 fun fact that's a stolen psp emulator for mobile
ok the hard cut to the wobbling bird combined with the printer nearly killed me   bless you caddy
Holy shit that's the Mottram Wood pub I can't believe it you were spitting distance from my flat! I'm so devastated that I didn't bump into you but cool anyway haha
Just that intro. Yes. I love it.  Edit: Just finished the video and I can't believe all the effort hes has gone through to make this video. Simply amazing stuff and it has been a treat watching you grow and change over the years to really find your style and humor. Love you vids, Caddy.
That port of Crash of the Titans isn't a port at all. They've taken the PPSSPP emulator, loaded it up with an ISO image of the game, and have wrapped up the whole thing in a "neat" package.  There's *layers* to the bootleggery on display here
wait...Caddicarus isn't Chinese? What have I been badly translating to English then?
Okay so I just woke up from a nap and I decided to look at my notifications on YouTube and then I see this thumbnail and I can already tell I am in for a wild ride. Much love caddz ❤️
When in doubt eat fruit
One day, Caddy will encounter Cash Bandiloot, and it will be glorious. Props for making the trip for us here at home, you are truly a master of shit posting.
Hey Caddy been a while😊🖐️
Bandicunth
The idea that caddy drove 3 hours to play some cash bandiloot "game" that wasn't even there might just be the funniest thing I have heard this week.
if anything i was more surprised you drive a mustang, i spy a nice looking s2000 though
This was hilarious caddy
man bandicoot month this year was great i laughed every minute caddy you did an amazing job,  i wonder what next year will be unless crash bandicoot 5 releases maybe crash bandicoot merchandise? (the marketable word of crash bandicoot merchandise)
I've always wanted to snap a phone in half and I wish you did a meet up in Manchester 😂
As a note, the reason there's so many more bootlegs on Android is because the Play Store is significantly easier to put games on than iPhone, there are some guidelines but it is very lenient
That is a darn awesome intro!
3:52 dafuq, that's Kokatorimon from Digimon
"And why is that?"            "Ya Mum"
Who’s behind the camera at 1:08?
When a new video of yours drops i know my sides are gonna be hurtin from laughin! lova ya Caddy Daddy <3
HAPPY JUNE 33RD EVERYONE, THIS WILL BE A NATIONAL HOLIDAY
I was used to the 2D opening animation for Bandicoot Month since the beginning, but I do like the new 3D opening animation using Crash 4 character models.
Why do all of these bootlegs think crash is a fox? Bandicoot is in his name!
7:27 Crash looks like he's been driven mad by the three fingers.
3:58 that... that is a Kokatorimon isn't it?
I'm scared that Caddy mentioned a brazilian bootleg ps1 because now i'm pretty sure a lot of brazilians will comment here like they own the comment section  Please. no.
i love how caddy keeps getting more and more unhinged.
"I'm not Chinese, I'm Caddy" - Caddicarus, 2022.
I can't decide if I want to sleep or watch caddy
I know it has all ready past, but happy birthday mate
The magnified eyes!!! 😂😂😂 I’m crying 😂😂😂😂😂
not even the cameraman could hold himself together this time
Great video as always.  Want one more to find… try “Walt Disney’s Crash”  Yup… infamous Crash bootleg that’s a romhacked version of the Jungle book NES game. Quite insane
Ah, yes. Bootlegs. The go-to for every cheap oblivious relative for gifts to give to their young relatives because the cheaper you found it, the more wise you are
i believe there’s another crash bootleg that’s a hack of jungle book for NES
CASH BANOOCA
Caddy could make a landfill with the stuff he destroys for a 2 second bit. I don't know if I should be impressed or worried
My most favourite month of the year. Great to have you back in Bandicoot month Caddy,and when it comes to the good,the bad and the obscure. There’ll be bootlegs of our favourite bandicoot which are made around the world. Are these games made by Trash Bandicoot.
5:24 Crash has got a gun.
#CancelCrashBandicoot
31:20 I’m into trollface memes currently these days😂
July is the fox v2 bandi month
I see caddy has never had the ol' jum legs.
All Crash after CTR and before the trilogy remastered are bootleg
As a Brazilian, huge shame it wasn't even in the polystation
16:49 BOUNS ROUND LETS GOOOOOOO!
Fun fact: either your review for Zombies Run Crash Bandicoot didn't get posted, or they took it down. What a shame.
wait, you drive a mustang? nice
why would it push you backwards, are you a jet
Lovely video!
A shame you got played by that tosser woman on the phone. Thank you for the funny video and the good story telling.
maybe RPG maker can brighten your day
The trip was worth the sign jokes an  THE NORTH
It felt like forever since you posted😂
great video man it’s crazy to me when i think of how long i’ve been watching you for i loved your early videos and you’ve gotten even better i hope the rest of the year goes smoothly for you
3:27 and I see a refence to Shin getter robo I see what a wonderful video I shall giveth thee a like
Posted three days after bandicoot month but it’s still gonna be great
another banger video from our yass queen of peace
Omg he said Portugal... And I'm from Portugal... Life is complete
Fun Fact: Crash Advance 4 is really just a reskin of a generic bootleg engine based off a prototype port of a bootleg called "Digimon Adventure" on the SNES and reused by many, MANY other Sintax (sic) games on the system, and given the engine is a prototype... well, I don't think I need to explain.
Bandicoot Day again!   Edit: also, that Crash bird looks like a deformed Furby.
King chicken is a digimon
That feeling of joy you get when you see a new caddy vid!! 🤩🤩🤩
You change races when you die 😭😂
"sadly I'm three hours away from Manchester" as someone from the US my reaction was "day trip!"
couldn't even think to go for 'Daddicarus'?
11:33 new reaction clip, come get it twitter
I havent watched any of his video's in years and when coming back.... I got one thing to say. ..... Love the ponytail-
During the driving part I was confused why you were driving on the wrong side of the road and the driver's seat was wrong. But then I remembered you live in Backwards Land, uh, I mean Britian.
It has been three seconds and ive already felt horrified, petrified, terrified, all the while laughing
This chicken thing... It's the digimon kokatorimon am adult level digimon pretty weak xD
Id love him to do next time a video on more banned games
I'm from Brazil, my grandmother actually bought me a Karaoto one summer, I didn't understand english back then so I just picked a random game, so thankfully I avoided playing the Crash bootleg
Love the new intro animation.
I screamed at “YOUR MUM”
CRASH-BANDICOOT!!!😍😍😍B-B-BANDICOOT!!!
Hello Caddicarus. I hope that you can also do Spyro too especially The Legend of Spyro. : )
Living 3 hours away from Manchester makes the uk sound so small. I guess it's just a Texas thing, but from south Texas, I drive 4 hours to san Antonio at least once a month, Austin is an hour past that and Dallas is another 4 hours past that
Bash the fax
7:27 Oh, I see Caddy got the Lord of Frenzy ending in Crashden Bandiring.
Oh someone please find that knock off Crash cabinet for him.
12:16 nothing at all to say? Not even about the peeny trees? The treenises?
Review all from soft souls games
Portugal dont create the site of a Brasilian fake crash bandicoot game Wow we are the best bora caraças temos o Ronaldo e agora isto
That printer joke may have been the funniest thing I’ve seen all year!
22:42 that bit with the phones was the best
Fuckin love the new bandiconth intro
This is the only channel that I do not fast forward through the "sponsor" part lol
Wait a minute Something aint right  Its Cash Banooca Day, again
Is he gonna say it.. ....  0:55 BANDICONTH  Yay
Caddy be rockin those heels!
Ayy, he's back. 😎
I Started Watching Caddy For Crash. Now it's a holiday thing when he makes these now Caddy should have this month as a holiday for these games.
Caddy and Joel should collaborate on a Super Ghostbusters crossover album.
i like the new intro and the new haircut :)
July
When did we go to war with India?
Oooh an s2000
You are so close to 1 milion subs! You can do it great video
Dang it now i have to wait until next June in order to get the chance to fully go to the BOUNS ROUND >:c
36:32  This isn't just a reduced sweet and crunchy salad, this is M&S reduced sweet and crunchy salad
A three hour drive is nothing... if you live in South America.
Crash Bandi LIVES!
So close to 1 million, Caddy,  you're nearly there. Come on, you're so close.
Nice birthday present Caddy!
watching caddicarus totally blazed is as close to heaven as it gets does he know how good his vids are when you're high
Well. There goes my good night's sleep 😂
You know he's lost it when he starts talking to the oracles from Jak and daxter through his hands.
Im so happy that on the 25 of may (my bday) he was playing rotten crash games!!!
Well that was quick    Another bow for my boy caddy
Oh damn, Shin Getter Robo! 3:24-3:50
god, this video was so worth it! time to watch it a billion times over.
I like coddy
DUDE I’M LITERALLY FROM WAKEFIELD YOU CAME MY WAY AND I DIDN’T EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT
31:15 Finally , the King Caddy /Sebastian Horsley crossover we have all been waiting for
1:39 - 1:41 that was cursed.
Crash from super crashing bird looks like the love child of an angry bird x furbie
Is ironic that a company called sintax made the first game.
Your videos are amazing caddi
Why does that king chicken character in the one you are talking about around the 4 minute mark remind me of that one digimon
Eat Fruit
I can't believe my local area gets featured on a Caddy video.
35:05 - hey, that's Stockport Railway Viaduct , you drove through my hometown!
More like Junedicoot
I changed my name on Discord to "Halalmeat" because of this video.
Above all I can’t get enough of his transitions
Caddy's humour has always been a bit unhinged...but these past 3 videos have had me straight up weezing so often it sounds like I have a problem  Yass queen of peace The baby didnt make it [the most epic death sound ever] Caddy getting phones thrown at him...
This new Bandicoot intro is awesome!!!
You know it’s a good day when caddy uploads :)
So close to a million subs! Come on baby! Spyro retrospective is so close!
im a bit of an anomaly. an oddball marsupial monstrosity. im not just another wombat or wallaby. if you aint a bandicoot youre a wannabe. i gotta thank cortex for evolving me. have i become a problem huh probably. now that im on the run nobody's stoppin me. im coming for you tawna do you wanna piece.
It sounds so weird to hear Caddy speak with an American accent.
This was 10/10 Caddicarus content from start to finish. I'm thoroughly gruntled. I'm also glad I got extra high for this one.
How do you accidentally grate your knuckle to the bone on a cheese grater? You’d have to numb the area and go to town on it to get to the bone. Pri(c)k.
I think that gbc/a machine stands for gbc/gba
"With great power."                     -Spid Mn
it's bandicoot month !!!!!!
29:30 is funny joke
We have a Cash Bandiloot machine in one of my local pubs here in Glasgow, my friends and I frequently yell "woah" at it (Can 100% confirm it is still there I have a picture of it that's only 72 hours old)
Jundicoot? It should be julydiconth- (gets spinned away by cash)
Solid gold prolapsed tho
good to see ya man
"i was playing beatmania with the ps1 dj turntable°  >kkclue's video on beatmania was 5 days ago  wow?
Something about "Eat Fruit" was way funnier than it should've been
*COMBO OF AVGN, AND HOW TO BASIC. THATS WHAT YOU ARE GOOD MAN!!!*
England British land whatever the name of the country is it's like the 1800s and 1920s and 90s and 2000s all rolled into one
American accent Caddy is cursed and your hand deserved it for that
So... At the 3:53 mark that "Crash" is talking to Cockatrimon from Digimon?
Also, let's get Caddy to 1 million subs! He deserves that gold play button!
crasheta furacão
Jim, I would very much like to be your neighbor. It must be so entertaining to watch when you're filming
5:32 straight up killed me. I gotta get those eye magnifiers XD
Kinda disappointed this isn't called "The illegal world of Crash Bandibootlegs"
While its unforunute that you couldnt find the game at the pub. It looked like you and Karis (sorry if I spelled that wrong) had a nice roadtrip to Manchester.
It's crazy because I remember there being a Cash Bandiloot machine in The Pilgrim in Liverpool! I seen it not too long ago! It always made me laugh
Valió la pena la espera por un chiste de 1 hora? Valió cada maldito segundo
YESSS BANDICOOT MONTH
ewwww epic :(
How to spot a non-American, he thinks 3 hours is a long drive 🤣
I didn’t like this video. Maybe it’s just my mood. Hopefully I’ll like the next one.
Watch these mobile games get a lot of downloads
*EAT FRUIT!*
For some reason the shot with the mega-specs really tickled me XD
Finally, the long awaited lore reveal of Spons
Thanks caddy for existing
I laughed WAY too hard at the "tubaculosis" joke and I'm genuinely concerned that my sense of humor is irreparable now.
11:17 wait that's cover art for "Mind over mutant".
The more I Caddy the more I think he's slowly losing his mind. Being cooped up for so long tends to do that to you. That and hands. 😆.
EAT FRUIT!
20k and it’s finally 1 million subs!!!
Crash Bandicoot 2077 (2022) Robin Williams Ask JobCool The Woman 21:23
Priceless. From start to finnish. :)
I remember playing Nuts Milk on my Powerjoy, and that background for that game selection screen looked awfully familiar. Don't remember a crash knockoff game on it though, but it had Pandamar. Pandamar was Mario Bros but it's a panda.
This video was fantastic I'm gonna have to remember the hissing and pissing bit in the future
I Love your vids man and takes on jokes hell even Spon is funny ha keep up the good work my guy
I feel like you're now going to get dozens of people sending you messages that they've seen the gambling machine near them.
Perfect. I was looking for something to watch while eating dinner.
Getter Robo ? But why
22:44 how on earth did he survive all of this
Even though that month was supposed to be June but hey at least crash 4 is coming on ps plus and... 35:05 WTF WAS THAT STOCKPORT WHICH IS MY HOME TOWN YOU WENT PAST!!!
I feel increasingly concerned about what Caddy's neighbours must think of him.
I didn't know how the "Bouns Round" was going to go, but it made me laugh. Good one, Caddy!
I don't know why the Shin Getter Robo is on screen at 3:42, but I guess Cortex plans to use Getter rays to conquer the planet.
i always find it funny the difference in what is considered a long trip or not in different pats of the world. Here in western canada 6hr round trip could be a day trip for groceries pretty easily. maybe once a month or so
this man sure makes alot of crash videos :P
anybody know why there are two different color discs of warped? I have like a blue one and then one that is just cd colored.
Oh look. It’s Bash Candicoot.
Bandicounth is here
14:23 Always Portugal stealing Brazil's treasure 😭
Holy shit is that Jennifer Lopez?!
5:32 is such a perfect image. O.O
Were those digimon in the first one, what?
3:25  Wait a minute!! I think I know what on earth is that
This made my day. Thanks caddy daddy
This is the best June 33rd of my life!  also, thank you for sacrificing your knuckles for us caddy much love forever m8
gentle giant
The first game shows you the dream crossover with Digimon's Kokotarimon
3:25 I can believe that cortex can destroy the earth, after all, he's piloting the shin getter now.
These new characters in the Caddy Cinematic Universe are really starting to make Marvel sweat.
WARNING: spons jumpscare at 9:03
12:00 …is that the Apple sprite from Scribblenauts?
Well we didn't find a gambling machine, but now we know what houses to burn down to finally rid ourselves of SPONSE
Glad to see you doing better, Daddy Caddy. Don't strain yourself too much, this helped scratch my itch for new content from you for a while 💗
Okay people! you know the drill! Caddy is 21k away from one million subs, let's get him there!!
Caddy: "The UK has more pubs than blades of grass." Me: "And here I thought the Irish had a drinking problem."
Was that mechanic Godzilla in fall guys?
Caddicarus is the funniest channel on YouTube change my mind
22:52 Ooh, yes, more Dad of the Year material from Caddy.
21:10 Tom Played Five Nights At Freddy's At Freddy Jumpscare!!!
Eat fruit 🤣🤣🤣
6:50 oh God, I’ve seen this before. This is one of many copy and pasted bootlegs of the same game.
It's okay, Caddy. The way I see it, Wombat July is the knockoff Bandicoot June, so actually this was a perfect upload schedule
Someday you'll find the Cash Banooka gambling machine, Caddy. Someday. Maybe even win some Cash on it, too. Believe me.
You should told me to make a video about Nickelodeon games next
3:54 Is that a Digimon?  It is...That's Kokatorimon
Few day’s late. 😐
when the nxt vides releases this channel will be among the big M ones
0:42 Half expected the bird to go twat at some point but that would be rude. 3:54 That looks like a Kokatorimon(Yes real name) 8:27 Every copy of Cash Banooca is personalized Ah yes, Brazil is infamous for those knock off consoles. 23:03 comes great big booty bitches. And this is how Caddy ends. Murdered by a baby 39:11 Gross
correct me if I'm wrong but the third game is one of many copy pasted games created by the same company that just makes bootleg games by putting different sprites over the same layout over and over they did it with shrek sonic and i think mario
man youve gotten so funny
3:58 That's literally Cockatrimon from Digimon lol
why would we doubt he went to Manchester the madman shaved his face for a 2 second bit.
I’m so sorry you had to drive to Manchester, the most boring city in the UK.
happy Bandiconth everybody! im so glad we extended this year's June to the 33rd to wait for you!
Six minutes in and I've already laughed a ton! You may have lost some finger flesh but you haven't lost the bandicoot touch!  ...seriously though, ouch, wishing a speedy recovery to your shredded cheese of a knuckle.
He looks like Qui-Gon Jinn
Yay caddy daddy is back wooo missed u so much
I guess the bootleg industry really need to *Crash*-ing down
Funny enough cira ctr nitro fueled, king chicken is an actual crash character:)
I know there’s a bootleg Crash game on a PSP knockoff, but all it was was a reskin of The Jungle Book on the NES
3:52 is that the digimon kokatorimon???
"He's throwing his own tears" = Isaac reference
Wait, wait, wait. Caddy can drive?
We need to find the Crash Bandiloot gambling machine. We need to give Caddy some redemption
Bandicunth
Stanley is such a good boy.
I'm actually here early! wow!
22:42 This joke was too good. Caddy, you are a legend.
I see Cockatrimon in that first game's opening.  What fresh hell happened there?
3:27 Shin Getter Robo in a Caddy video.  I am pleased
I love that you ended on a MBMBAM reference and i dont even know if you knew it was a reference
Waiting 4 daddy caddy to beat the  CTR dev times
3:52 Tf is Kokatorimon (a digimon) doing here?! 5:30 If you're not laughing, how?
3:53 Wait is that a Digimon? I’m damn sure that’s Kokatorimon. WHY IS DIGIMON HERE?!
Please play Returnal
I never knew there were Crash boot legs.
Me: *Sees Barnsley and Penistone signs* Also me: *Screams in unintelligible Yorkshire gibberish*
13:23 bro what even is a Karaoto? Never heard of that in my life. In Brazil, these PSone shaped famiclones are usually called PolyStation nowadays. Btw great vid, mate
16:56 that game there is a banger ngl
Every second of tikis choice was comedy gold
I'm so gutted about the machine. I think I want to try finding one myself.   Started laughing from that very first frame!  Brilliant as ever.  Happy June 33rd to all!
Almost at a million!
The fact that caddy went all the way to Manchester on a 3 hour drive just for a video, that’s commitment
Why not crash toys but at least there’s a video
I should be in bed, but Daddy Caddy comes first! I hope you feel better soon Caddy!
24:13 So am I the one that's gonna bring up that the zebra's "superpower" is CAMOUFLAGE? Yep I bet predators have a real hard time seeing black and white stripes against the brown and green land of a wide open safari...
3:51 Is that Cockatrimon? From Digimon?
If there's one thing this world needs now, it's a Bri'ish bootleg Cash Banooca gambling machine. We need to find it, lads!
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I genuinely hope everyone here will find someone who supports them the way Cerys supports Caddy. Tagging along for a 6 hour road trip to find an elusive bootleg crash gambling machine is A+.
Just a thought- which character of British children's literature would be best served voiced by caddy? An adaptation of Alice in wonderland with caddy voicing the Cheshire Cat..... Cheshire Cadd. Or the wind in the willows with caddy voicing Mr Toad........J caddius toad. To help decide, imagine each one saying: What do you mean I'm banned from the yacht club? Listen I only sniffed them a little bit!! My vote goes to caddy toad 🐸
So, was that Phoebe, Chloe or Amy throwing stuff at Caddy?
Caddy in December: Goes into a restaurant dressed as Jesus Caddy in June: Drives 3 hours just for a bootleg Crash slot machine
yar har piracy go brrrrr
The Super Crash Battle is literally PPSSPP emulation...
18:50 Im not usually the "le random ADHD humour" enjoyer...  But this was funny lol
Time for more bandoca on bandiconth 33rd
Oh God that Android phone scene Just killed me
18:52 Well, At least we have learned that Caddy has American plugs in his house.
The funny thing about Crash 4 Advance is that it was _also_ made by Sintax. Every single one of the GBA platform games they made are the _exact same game,_ usually sprite-swapped into some other IP. A lot of them were also notoriously difficult to emulate and dump online for a long time due to Sintax putting some bizarre copy protection on the roms.
The Crash Angry Bird looks like the most hellish furby I’ve had the displeasure of seeing-
Remember seeing a Cash Bandiloot machine at a beachside pub in Skegness on a holiday last year and took a photo instantly thinking of Caddy hahaha. Hopefully it's still there if you wanna make another trip!
Oh boy he's at it again
Excuse me?! My little pony puppies?! What the hay is your bucking reason for that you wet paper tissue? You will not speak any more!
35:42 I used to work in Penistone.  Pronounced Pennyston if anyone is wondering.
Krash Bandi sounds like the prostitute you find in 1 of the bounds rounds.
30:50 was my breaking point. I laughed for over 2 minutes and just when I stopped, 32:10 came along. And literally the second after 32:47.
reminds me of the time I saw Dreasure Planet
Portugal !!! Portugal !!! Portugal !!! Portugal !!!! Portugal !!! Portugal !!!!
I’m convinced his daughter is named Kiddy and no one can tell me otherwise
I didn't think there were any Crash Bandicoot bootlegs, but I'm not surprised that there isn't a lot of them. Still a fun video though and I'm sorry for your broken knuckle Caddy and that you didn't get to play the Crash Bandiloot game. Wherever it went, I'm sure someone's enjoying it. Anyway, Happy Crash Bandicoot Month to you!
Portugal !!!
20:40 the phone want him a wife and not realizing he has a wife already
A 6 hour road trip for a single skit you gotta respect caddi for this
Well bandiconth is happening since 4 is on PlayStation plus this month
YO MADE IT JUST IN TIME, JUST 2 HOURS LATE XD
15:38 I can’t believe I’m actually defending this game, but that glitching is probably because the game was meant to be played on a CRT tv where that wouldn’t have been seen. Like, super mario bros. 3 has the same issue.
daddy caddi got me nervous at 24:35
Why do Stanley's eyes look weirdly human
Ah yes, new video
I live in THE NORTH!! what a small world
19:39 xD
Well, didn't expect another vid to come this soon. Thanks Cad.
Is that a Captain Scarlet reference? Ahaha  Nice.
Getting real close to that 1 mil mark dude, congrats! Are you going to do something special for the occasion?
Did anyone else prepare to give Caddi a high five too?
Plot Twist: The Crash Bandicoot Bootleg Gambling Machine is in a pub on Birmingham...owned by the PEAKY BLINDERS!!!!!!!
Been watching you so long I remember the song you made about your Westie and I think this is the first video that has made me laugh more than your ancient video on crash bash. Thanks for all the years of laughs Caddy.
3:54 That's not just a chicken, that's a digimon! I'm almost certain that's cockatrimon, I don't know what it's traced from though.
welcome to manchester Caddy, and in turn, welcome to a civilisation
I Was drinking a soda... and when i saw that crash boot leg, i tried to endure but when the slap came. i spit my drink...  all over my laptop...
June eleventy three
Of all the days to get this, it had to be my birthday. Lets. Go.
3:56 I didn't know that evil is gay
wait your 28? happy late birthday
27:47 I nearly died laughing.
600th comment NEVER MIND 500 COMMENTS IN A SECOND?? JESUS
always here to support king caddy
Caddy: The month is June!  Lord Slug: What are you talking about, it's July!
599th comment
I wonder how his neighbors think when does these funny skits
Ah yes BANDİCONTH My favourite month
27:45 Wow, that was quick
The drive to Manchester bit reminded me of roadtrips with my dad Just insanity
Well I think you did the right thing Caddy making it july this time, because well, The latest Crash game is the free game on ps4 this month!
You are a legend! You actually drove all that way for the arcade machine! 😂
di.....did crash team...make you an intro?
37:38 lmao
BRAZIL MENTIONED????????
Bandicomth: caddy daddy talks about cash bannoca rip-offs. If I have to say any more fake words, im going to have a stronkendhwbdynsks
man this was super funny again! I love seeing your videos, they are so creative and unique whatever topic you choose^^
How are all of  you doing
You're 28!? Jeez Caddy, I feel like it was Yesterday when I just discovered your Dalmations 3 video. What's my age again?
It must be so fun to film all of this
Who called  Themselves halalmeat 22:06
Funny yell guy
RIP Robbin Williams, hope you enjoyed your parody
Woah
I'm so glad you are still doing this after all these years, love you my dude <3
Ballsy marketing strategy for fall guys i suppose
God every single Caddicarus episode has me cry laughing throughout the entire episode. Every single minute has me chuckling and cackling. Thanks for all the laughs it truly makes my entire day
OMG YEA Bandicunth
28:42
I'm...I'm older than Caddy? *fades to dust*
I think this is your greatest yet. Basically have me laughing from second 1. Also, to answer that last question. Yes, and not just in space.
6:19 when the adhd kicks in
Imagine being the local bobbies(British slang for cops) and coming to a grown man filming himself going over a fence in a Bandicoot costume
When the printer printed F--- NO over THAT face I completely lost it. I was laughing so hard!
When I saw that face on 18:51 I got flashback
I hope Amazing Brave Rach is in here
The hand puppet sequence killed me
Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony, then everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked, only Daddy Caddy, Master of Cash Banooca could stop them. But when the world needed him most, he vanished, and then he came back
I swear, I saw this road trip in my dreams some time ago... Like, I vaguely remember the look of the Cash machine and Caddy showing the sign and him talking quickly while showing some of this stuff.
why does everyone think he's a fox
Straight up had an sfm, crazy.
Ah, a Caddy video. Today, is a good day (IsayinRocko'sModernLife)
Download the new peppa pig game.
Caddy has done it again. Awesome.   (Also-- sorry to hear about your injury... here's hoping for as quick a recovery as possible.)
I love you caddy you make my work days bearable.
Bandicoot, band of hilarity! Jim, you never dissapoint!
4:00 That thing, on the throne is Kabuterimon. Crash Bandicoot works for a damned Digimon.
How the hell are you this funny
Heartbroken that he couldn't find the gambling machine smh what a cruel world we live in
Just loving the alternate universe Doctor Strange haircut.
you think caddy's realized that the japanese releases actually call the wumpa fruit "apples"
Crash Advanced 4 is one of a legacy of bootlegs that are all identical in gameplay.   Mario, Sonic, Shrek, Lord of The Rings. All the same bootleg game as Crash Advanced 4. Just different sprites
favorite content on yt
6:42 Who you gonna call? the-FIREMAN.
He is not Chinese, he is Caddiese
3:42 that’s Shin Getter Robo
22:42 Great bit right there I tell you
But what has become of the bricks?
Moment of silence for Caddy, who try as he might, could not find the Crash Bandiloot machine. Life isn’t fair.
Mate, I honestly wonder what your neighbours think of you 🤣
You own a E-Mach? You know the Volkswagen Caddy is a very practical car...
I swear to god, there's a face on the phone at 38:40; I know it's probably just smudges catching the light, and if they are, those are some damn scary-looking smudges, but if they aren't then that's fantastic editing, lol
22:55 I love how Caddy is willing to gas one of his own stepdaughters for the sake of a video
"Went on a DRIP" . . . Caddy with the drip?
King Chicken looks like a super compressed Kokatorimon
I'm fairly sure I've been in that service station.  Oh, and the video was very good too.
This video was uploaded at 18:01 o clock
At least they didn’t mess up Spyro the dragon in those games
Bro has a Wrx and an S2k tf?
5:25 rent free in my brain forever
I didn’t know that there were three bootleg crash bandicoot games just with those free games alone crash bandicoot has been put through so much abuse at least all those PS to crash bandicoot games and crash of the titans or better than those game boy and game boy advance knock offs
i really wonder what your neighbors think of you sometimes lol
Such adventures! Too bad you didn't find it :(
Holy shit, is that a motherfucking Brazil reference? (Salve galera)
0:50 Oh.  He said it!  Alright boys, time to head off to social media to cancelled him.  #CaddyIsOverParty
We need to band together and get this boy a Cash Bandiloot machine
I love how he's basically becoming an even more absurd version of AVGN.
Shocked Caddy didn't take the chance to mention that Cash Banooca isn't a fox.
What on earth?
the incredible lengths he goes to make these jokes
That new bandicoot month intro is legendary
Look on the bright side, you managed to leave Manchester without being stabbed by a local.
tbh was hoping you'd make a video about bootlegs oneday
"Squirrel named after the amount of shits I give" ledge
14:50 needs to be a meme picture. I Insist!
Caddy's heeled walk is such bad form, but it's hilarious. Even funnier with the crash suit.
Wait... 28th birthday... I thiought you were... nevermind...
Fall grass
Happy Bandicunth everyone yes it's still June there's no such thing as July. There's 61 days in June
THE NORTH
This is so funny, great vid cadd!
38:58 I think You woken The Birthday Monster
the efforts he is putting to make these   videos is enormous
Caddi is a unique and wonderful YTuber. The Epic sponsorship is AWESOME, I am glad Caddi got such a big sponsor.
Lets push my friends  to the million subs
that was quick
I'm great thank you cad, and thank you for askin.... Oh. You don't care.
Caddy dayyy
S P O N S L A N E ! ! !
GUYS, WE FOUND CADDY'S BELOVED BRICKS! They're behind him at 1:06!  Edit: Also, that image of "the planet covered in blood" is concept art for a Mars mission that, among other places, was printed in a DK Eyewitness Book I've read before.
Is it just me when he picks up wumpa fruit it sounds like you selected a pokemon or move around in the menu for the og pokemon game
My favorite pride, Bandicoot.
That introduction do be giving me a little joy
Finaly new video. 22 minuts later  22:43 🤣🤣🤣🤣
6 hour round trip? Us Americans call that a commute to work. 😂
Wait thats illegal...  Sorry not sorry
Caddickadick!!!!!!!!! You're Baaaaaaack!!!!
can't believe it's june 32nd already
5:28 magnified eyes best bit
30 Days has September, April, June, and November. All the rest have 31 except February alone. Which has 8 and a score, until leap year gives it one day more.
I saw the Brazilian flag and entered immediately
Honestly if that was me I'd list the name of the place that gave me the bad information and shame them online until the offered to reimburse for gas costs...
Probably just set off his uk viewer based to find one slot or fruit machine for a follow up video
finallyyyyy
That intro animation was great. Thank you Caddy. Happy June 33rd.
In Mexico bandicoot in their country was named suethepeoplecausewedidntdonothingandusacopyourgames
Salad isn't food.
Caddy thank you for all the hard work you’ve been doing, it seems like you’re getting screwed over at every turn but you still manage to drop these awesome, hilarious, dense videos that are so damn enjoyable. Caddicarus Podcast ftw
not only portugal stole our gold and wood, they also stole our bootleg games god damnit
Since when a pinned comment saying June 33rd?
29:35 Caddy: I got Tuberculosis Caddy: *Shows a Euphonium* My musician brain: THAT'S NOT A TUBA My humor brain: Hehe tubes.
WOOOOO NEW CADDY VIDEO keep up the amazing work
7:55 Cash Banuca knows Jump Cancelling
9:22 Fall Guys!? I’ve played since Day 1 in Summer 2020!
I've never clicked on a video so fast... Thank  you so much for the awesome content!!
Greeeeeeeeetings Knuckleless cretin
The gags in between absolutely killed me lol! Next time maybe ask on twitter to check? I live near Manchester would of gladly gone check prior lol
9:04 The return of Spons!
4:00 that is cockatorimon, a bird digimon whose whole existance is based around the idea that bird-children digimon dont want to evolve into it.
33:45 Jim i found a a dog named doge would you Review him
You're only 28?
5:33, could not stop laughing
Maybe Jumming is like Morbing
As soon as cash tickle us laughed I couldn't contain the laugh just looking at him wearing the thing... That alone was funny but to actually laugh with us makes it more fun, never change caddicarus, you're awesome as you are
22:12 Hahahaha! Halalmeat.
Favorite part: spons
I don't care if it's late, I just want Banoocunth.  Edit: EFFING SINTAX. They are NOTORIOUS for being one of the worst and most prolific bootleggers ever. And they aren't so much a groin cream as much as what you buy the cream to get rid of.
Caddy is always entertaining ever since i found his channel, and i feel he likes cheese
Caddy complaining about driving 3 hours. I can drive 3 hours and not leave my state. Or even traverse half of it.
I’m gonna wait for Caddy to get over a million subs because his content genuinely made me laugh.
Currently going through a mind-numbing week of wisdom teeth recovery, and I’ve been binging all of Caddy’s amazing content. Thanks for putting a bunch of smiles on my bloated jaw, my friend. Keep it up!
3:56 That chicken is a Digimon, Kokatorimon.
Fnf fans:yo this song il fire😩🔥 the song: 26:44
3:51 That "King Chicken" is actually a Digimon called Cockatrimon (More like COCKatrimon, am I right fellas)
The mad lad is back!!!
24:10 Believe it or not, I did know that!
Yeeeeeeeeee
this was fantastic and so worth the wait!! and nice to see you come down to manchester aswell despite that machine not being there
Claim your "here within 2 hours ticket"
Today I rewatch all your bandicoot mount vid It's great
So that zombies run game is also a ripoff of Zombie Highway, which I miss dearly
for the love of god, please make these intro permanent, i died laughing
I remember playing a Crash Java game on an old Nokia years ago. Not sure if it was official or not though
0:03 I was waiting for him to smash through the garage door from within. Lol!
*HE'S BACK!!!* 😁
Hello Mr. Cad "Caddy" Dicarus. I am currently breaking into your home to pet your dog.
LETS GOOOO
WOW JUNE 33rd video release
CADDY, I'M BRAZILIAN AND I NEVER SAW THAT CONSOLE IN MY LIFE
Just finished watching your PS1 acccessories video before this and oh god this was a shitshow. Keep making more of these please. I'm starving for more.
1:26 Is that Mario for the Playstation 2?
Bandiconth isn't a time or even a place. It's a state of being.
Is it just me wondering why there isn't a Crash bootleg called Cash Banooka?
That Crash Nes game does run slow, but there are nes emulators that have overclock speeds options to make games run faster... I wonder if this game was made in a emulator when it was overclocked?
Aku Aku wasn’t lying in most of the questions. You do solve world hunger by making everyone eat fruit and you also gain and lose weight by eating fruit.
Caddi its good to have you back. Thank you for all the laughs you gave me! Can’t wait for more of your hilarious and cool content!
If it's your birthday today then happy fricken birthday to you.
So does this mean next Bandicoot month will be Crash Fan games? I'd be down for that honestly.
It's The Return of Bandicoot Month! in June- I Mean, July I Guess? Anyway Join The Video.👍🏻
PRAISE GEE-SAUCE THE CAD MAN LIVES
Considering I only live 15 minutes away from the pub caddy was filming in; I am going to go actively look for this elusive jukebox with the orange rat adorning it.
Super Crashing Bird looks like a Furby.
5:25 for his neutral special he wields a gun  5:33 remind me of crash ded animation stung by a bee xp
3:47 The EVA-01 is my favourite Cash Banooca character, right alongside Kokatorimon
Do pizza tower it’s like wario land if you don’t know pizza tower than ask ant dude or it’s on pc the new eggplant build just released.
I like how the genesis crash game had apples cajse everyone who played crash thought the wampa fruit were apples. Even joked about in uncharted 4. Though when i forst played it my first thought were peaches
The crash advanced thing is a reskin of Sonic 3 fighter sonic another bootleg for the gba
These are getting more and more Derranged
1:22 the literal way to roast Putin
3:26 my god cortex is planning to use getter rays to defeat crash
“What is the cure of AIDS”  “That’s not my problem”
“With great power” - Caddicarus 2022
I think this is the most unclean I've ever felt watching a Caddicarus episode     That's a compliment.     Seriously, the most blursed video on the internet rn.     10/10
When caddicarus was driving to the pub he drove past a tesco I've been in it was the one in Stockport next to the recently built porche garage you can see in the vid I actually live in Stockport
you should’ve gone to spon(s) end in coventry because bum joke
He’s 28?! He better get hot and thin again.
Bandiconth
A new video.  I am truly blessed
Im very terrified that Caddy is the same age as me.
I am very offended by that "tuba" joke. That was a euphonium you rapscallian
"I'm about to cut off my arms at this point"  Well it looks like you actually tried. All jokes aside, I hope you heal and recover quickly
I’m considering this my reward for exercising today. Will watch as soon as I can breathe again
Bandicussy
I love the little character breaks
That character seen in 3:44 is from anime that anime is called Shin getter robo armageddon (The character is Shin getter robo itself)
This video will be the one that will give caddy that last push to 1 mill. That means the next video will be the spyro video i honestly have been waiting for that longer than i had to wait for infinity war XD
Caddickaroos, cashbanshem is fabrit game. how dare ew. youtube latinautor steal theve
Holy smokes 1 hour old with 9k likes. We have been patiently waiting, brother. An upload well worth the wait
CADDY! I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR ANOTHER VID
Glad to see the video is up, even with all of the complications and knuckle-slicing! Good on you Caddy, 1M is close!
The crash bandicoot in the 2003 huge adventure looks like he was made by dingo pictures
driving 6 hours just to try and find the gambling machine is the bouns round
If Bandicoot Month is June, only fitting that Knockoff Bandicoot is in Not June.  Is that Crash Bazooka?
3 day late Banoocus month
Seeing this is so beautiful
Why was that groan at 25:40 one of the funniest noises I’ve ever heard him make?
6:22 Peter Griffin: Hey, I just got a crazy idea.
It's always a great day when Caddy uploads a Crash Bandicoot video. Caddy is the best CB video creator on YouTube. Endlessly entertaining.
Great video once again but I have to ask...  Who is the greatest person ? Caddy for driving 3 hours just to see a gambling machine... Or his girlfriend for actually coming with him in a good mood at that ?! I want a girlfriend like that ! ... Scratch that, I want a girlfriend.  Oh and also... How many people immediately remembered "Krash Bandi" from that video Caddy did a while back before he even mentioned it ? I did. And I am proud.
me when i open up the window to hear the birds chirping 0:41 😂
30:49 Leaked footage of the next Angry Birds Movie.
That "King Chicken"  was a Digimon, Kokatorimon to be exact.
I am happy to see a new video for Bandiconth. 3:42 That is Shin Getter Robo, by the way. Don't know why that's there.
AH YEAH! CASH BANOOCA TIME!!!  Also, sorry for your finger. I hope you feel better.
Shit welcome back hope your fingers getting better
im gonna count this as a day early birthday present thank you caddy
1:38 well i be having nightmares of that now thank you
After getting a positive test for covid yesterday, this is exactly what I needed.
I T S     J U L Y     T H I R D      Y  O  U       C L A S S     T R A D O R
I knew I wouldn’t miss bandicoot month.
24:19 that's not what colourblind means.
Brooo is that crash *BANDI*
I love the new bandicoot month intro!
Hey caddy this was nicely done. Hope the finger got better
Luckily i never played any of bootleg Crash Bandicoot games before. That Crash/Angry Bird hybrid character looks like Hasbro's Furby!
That chicken in the first game is a goddam digimon! I’m not kidding, this splat just took a digimon and put in together with crashly brashly lol
Wait a minute…Crash The V2 Bandi game looks awfully similar to the knock off Bendy games that Captain Sauce found a while ago on his Mobile Masochist series…
Okey we need to get this guy to one million suscribers
Caddy is by far THE funniest youtuber ive seen on this platform. The range of comedy is so hilarious
Product Fit For A Machine would be an awesome name for an industrial album
yoooooo a new video xD i watched ya old ones and by gawd. you did tell me not to in one of ya other videos, shoulda listened xD
Ah so many fond childhood memories of door door.
Why is EET FROOT making me cackle like a dumbass?! Has my sense of humor degraded so much over the years?!
0:17 by a slip of finger i made it max volume at midnight
3:41 ... wait, is that Shin Getter Robo?
AEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Fun Fact: There’s one more Crash bootleg game that Caddy should know about. It’s called Walt Disney’s Crash and it’s featured on a bootleg game system called the PVP Station Lite 2000.  Long story short, it’s basically a bootleg of the NES Jungle Book game.
Caddi I dare you to play every single Crash Bandicoot game like the N sane Trilogy and the og ps1 games and make a video about it (you have to 100% each game and get all of Platinum relics from the time trials)
26:27 I don't think that's a direct port I feel they just stole PPSSPP's code and filled it with adware
15:58 "That's the last Crash bootleg"  *Video still has over 24 minutes left*  YOU ARE NOT FOOLING ME TWICE CADDY
Called every June as Bandicoot Month. Upload his vid to YouTube on July. Classic Caddi!!
Always a treat
Babe wake up new Caddicarus video dropped
HELL YEAH I WAS RIGHT ABOUT THIS VIDEO BEING A VIDEO ON BOOTLEGS FROM THE CRASH WRINKLE OF COWPAT PLAYTHROUGH HINTS!  I would like a cookie.
1:37 I didn't even realize Bootlegs kind of sound like Boot Legs!
3:53 never thought I would see a Digimon in a “Crash bandicoot” game
OUR KING IS BACK
This is PTSD
Welcome back, Caddy!
The king has returned.
Caddy uploaded?
What is this
so much stuff on fire in here. and the bouns round was longer than the "main" video.  caddy has gone batty
I don't know which moment is more cursed, this 16:16 or this 28:46
21:10 ha ha tom
HE (AND IT)'S BAAAAAAAAAAACK!!!
22:42 is my favorite skit of any video
Wait a sec… I think I saw this machine in Italy when I was like 14, that was 11 years ago.
Wait I have the same blender but red !!
11:27 wtf ahahahahhaaa.Ok i will translate it. Doctor Cortex kidnapped Cresh's girlfriend-Teiwna,for Cresh perform his evil plan Cresh - refuses and goes to save his love Press start P.S that isn't my inaccuracy,that how it was written in text
MLP GAME AND LPS
OH BOY CASH BANOOKA TIME
steam is better then epic
No bouns round for you caddy
OI CAMERA MAN REVEAL AT 1:07   the legends of the ghost camera have died...
7:57  Potential asdfmovie skit
6:19 "Call now and receive a free toaster for your sandwich." ...but that's a panini press :P
"Alright, cock?" "What did you call me?"
King Chicken is Cockatrimon from Digimon!  Such a shame about the Bandiloot machine. I wonder if they rotate the machines between pubs or if it goes into storage in a warehouse somewhere?
Roger Roger!
Almost 1 million subs!!!!
I just watch KKclues video on beat mania, saw caddy uploaded, clicked, and he also mentions beatmania??? wtf
26:24 This is PPSSPP, a PSP emulator.
🤣🤣lost it at putin pooed in a tin.
I'm just away to have an early night and be sensible.  **Caddy releases a new video**  Oh FFS.
Glad you made a video but it's July
Video idea The delightful world of dlc
I keep forgetting this channel exists so it's a wonderful kick in the face whenever you drop a video Caddy
The month is June...  *uploaded July 3rd*
I'm a simple man.  I see Daddy Caddy upload a video about Cash Banooca...   *I CLICK.*
imagine driving 3 hours to manchester to play a bootleg gambling machine
I'm absolutely absorbed by your characters such as spons or handy. This almost feels like dream but much better!
“Now this is a story all about how I caught Ebola and then I died.” -Caddicarus, 2022
E A T F R U I T
Only 40 minutes? I want this video to be at least 2 hours
honestly quite incredible
PERFECT TIMING    its raining :)
Is the thing under the Bootleg sign Apps? It looks like it might be
26:45 "...to make the game sound like death". After hearing what it said at 2x speed, I died of laughter, resurrected, and died again.  It also makes it sound like some lost tribe of aliens are attempting to speak English...and failing whilst having a seizure.
So I’m pretty sure that’s the Tesco where I work across the road from the pub…. In Hattersly ….. mind was melting in the build up to that moment
Man, you are so close to 1 Million subs.
21:09
Happy belated birthday caddy!
When you suddenly put on an American accent, I cracked up. It was really accurate!
I want to migrate to spon lane
I’m not surprised Uka Uka wouldn’t care about the cure for AIDS.
Ngl I saw the signs for Sheffield on the way to Manchester and went “AYYYYY IM KINDA SORTA IN A VIDEO”
10:02 holy shit wall of flesh noise
1:01. I recognize that man’s face! He’s the nice man who watches me from outside of my window. I tried to invite him over for thanksgiving but he ran away as fast as he could. Sad.
tthis shouldve been just about Bootleg games overall! that'd be so much fun!
Happy 28th Birthday Caddy!
1:50 in and loving it. Your humour makes me proud to be British. LIKED thank you for your work 👌👌😂😂👍👍
I literally think Caddy would dig to the core of the Earth if there was a crash game he's never heard of down there
Hold on caddy owns a s2000?
I could use some sintaxl I pulled my groin today no joke lol   A 6 hour trip is not that far lol that’s a half day trip for us Americans hell my grandparents live ten hours away and we make it in one day
Eat fruit!
worth the wait as alway caddy, great stuff
Wow i thought this is a old video
The fact that it's July 3rd is a showcase about how long this video took to make.
🤟
Mm gud ole kush badokum gaymes fom casmuskus
Gotta respect Caddy's dedication to his videos. Thank you, Caddy. You make life lifeliabler 👍👍👍👍
2 late bandiconths in a row? What's next, Caddy gets a ne- oh...
Caddy forgot Bob the Penguin on android!!! It's probably the biggest crash knock off in existence despite the name. The exact same enemies, boxes, warp room and environment (snow from crash 2).  Btw, Caddy visited my hometown of Stockport for the Cash Bandiloot machine. I got really excited seeing the big ol' viaduct lol
Best moment at 5:30
sounds like a perfect call to action, find the gambling machine and see if anyone in england has seen it recently
bora Brasiiiil!
Ah, man! I love Crust Bungoroot!
13:05 this is a polistation,aquele que arruinou a infância de vários brasileiros.
Why does the gbc game over screen look like Garfield??
My god THE NORTH cant imagine anything worse
I love Collin randy for the funplay 6
E A T  F R U I T
These games are nightmare's yeah and buy something from a foreign person definitely not a illegal game system
The moment he mentioned iphone games my blood ran cold. The things Caddy will do for content. EDIT: I'm sorry he drove 3 hours for a single bootleg this man's insane.
Finally, Bandiconth
Now I that the answer to everything is eat fruit!
The fact that Caddy drove a total of 6 hours just to film a bit, even if he didn't succeed at what he wanted, really does show his commitment to art
how many times have you killed your children in your videos
This was released on my bday! Amazing gift ;P
Meep
Eat fruit!
POV: CASH BANOOCA JUST BROKE INTO YOUR BACKYARD
I've played the game at 29:58 on one of those unblocked games but instead of Cash Banooca, it was Mario
4:24 now this is the story all about how I got Ebola and then I died
I wonder how many phones you went through for this video.
CADDICARUS UPLOADED ON A SUNDAY?! HOLY SHIT, IT'S A CADDISTMAS MIRACLE! 🎄 🎄 🎄
Very American of you to drive three hours for so little
4:41 Wow we had the same thought.
Bring back long Denis
Love the fact that as soon as I saw caddy submit a review on the App Store, I instantly went to check if it was there and gave me a nice giggle to see it was 😂
"Crash, altar evil to be straight" Wow, didn't know these games were so homophobic.
Caddicarus has gone absolutely insane and is stalking a pub. I think the Wumpa fruit is getting to him.
Crash the fox bandi had 1 video of information for what I know by Peter Knetter when he was looking at terrible mobile games
I got a vid The ridiculous radical world of resident evil
What bothers me the most about the first bootleg is that I know what those enemies are and where they come from, and what's worse, they're actually from a reaaally good NES game, Mitsume Ga Tooru, one of my favorite NES games besides Super Contra, SMB3, Kirby's Adventure and TLOZ. Go try it. It's great in everything (from music, to stage design, to bosses). It's a short game but very engaging and it draws you in.
5:27 Worth the bit.
What are those glasses called, I want them!!😂
Fingally
13:48  iS iT tOo LaTe NoW
yoooo @17:35 what is this track, this is hittin.
Good job used sfm
5:27. I'm so glad there was an outtake for that. XD
CASH BANOOCA AND CADDY ARE BACK *WOOOOOOO*
Eu quero que o caddy faça um analog horror sobre Carlos bomdechute
Ummm...  dunno if I'm the only one, but is that sprite at 3:52 of a Kokotorimon from digimon?
There's a small amusement park near the beach at Swanage that, until about ~2018, had a bootleg Crash-themed dodgems ride.  As far as I know the ride and its vehicles still exist, but the back wall was repainted with a more generic design.
holy shit beatmania
you missed  the crash bazooka joke
11:32 Nothing else to call it other than perfection!
I’m so glad I can expand my knowledge of Cash Banooca lore.
I actually know of another cash banooca android game, it's not directly called crash but it is entirely based on crash. "Bob : The penguin" , yes, a penguin , and yes, it is cashly bandiguin gameplay. Only on the google playstore, not on iOS ( i believe )
Happy birthday to you caddie
only Caddy would risk going to Manchester for 6 hours just to Find a gambling machine with a orange rat on it because a Pal told him it existed.  God bless you, you mad lad.
26:24: Oh hey, that UI looks almost exactly like the popular PSP emulator PPSSPP. Funny that.
HAPPY BANDICOOT MONTH GAMERS
It’s like Christmas in July
I would watch a whole series of just Caddy in his car
Caddy still being funny. Oh, and by the way, we are nearly 20.000 subs aways to get a long waited review of a certain purple dragon.
Dammit Caddy i was about to go to sleep.
Oh my Crash! Baddy Caddy is here to bless us with a new video!
3:25 never in my life did I expect to listen to sir Caddick talk like an alcoholic having a stroke over a gameboy crunched screenshot of the 1998 getter robo armageddon OVA series.
This was hilarious, Caddy! So worth the wait!
Love the video!!! Amazing as always!!!🤩🤩😍😍 Hopefully, your knuckle gets better soon and happy Bandicoot or Jundicoot month!!!😊😊😄😄
Thats Kokatrimon hahaha
KING OF THE NORTH!
This guy genuinely drove 3 hours to Manchester just to see a Crash Bandicoot gambling machine knockoff. What a legend
Let's Goooo!! New Viddd!!   The dedication he put in these vids are something else... and hilarious
"Crash, alter evil to be straight" aw hell naw
Caddy Daddy when will you do the undead world of Zombie video games
Guys that's it... I'm moving to *SPONS LANE*
Hey can you play all the megaman X games in a row  You can even do the game boy color games and the RPG if you like
Eh, Wumpa fruit are apples to the Japanese.
A fresh new vid from Caddy, you love to see it! <3
it feels like an early christmas every time caddy posts a new video
I just realized the HUD for that angry birds thing has a Mario 64 font got through candy cane counter
Cads, you're unbelievably entertaining. Thank you for your hard work and dedication to the craft!
He's back
Finally I get to see Brash Candiboot get his own game.
Damn, I was waiting for this all June and we finally here xD (~Two months to 1M sub Spyro special :))
whao crash banoooka
Oh that's why fall guys was in the " # " of this bandicoots related video
There were so many moments in this video that made me laugh so hard :D "That's foam not phone" was gold!
In the case of Android's app store you'll never find a more wretched hive of bootlegs and iniquity.
The fact that this came on my birthday makes my day better.
1:04 made me cry laughing at it's 1 AM here and I had to hold it. That super badly photoshopped photo of Conker never fails to make me lmao
NOW THIS IS A STORY ALL ABOUT HOW I CAUGHT EBOLA AND THEN I DIED  It's been a bad couple of days here. Death in the family yesterday, and just a stressful weekend. This helped put a smile back on my face.
That is funny 0:34 Crash booticoot 1:39 Pooticarus 1:57 Iceblending machine 2:43
Caddicarus: "I had my 28th birthday"  Me with my two brain cells adhd and whatever else is wrong with me mind: ..................my mom is older than you   That was seriously the first thing that came to mind
The man with the PS Wheels has made a bootleg Smash Brandi's Cootch Video. The world is now at peace.
Why does Dr. Neo Cortex have Shin Getter-1 all of a sudden? Why is there a King Chicken barking orders to Crash in the throne of the Sinistrals on Doom Island?
Commitment 10/10 I have actually played that machine in a Marston pub in Gloucester 🤣🤣
Im erly
Good to have ya back cads xD
at this point why not just move bandicunth to july
Good Video🙂But Stany Benny is the best part😍
He went to Manchester. That's so close but yet so far 😭
39:28 Okay, I laughed harder than I probably should've at this
5:32 Bottles, is that you?
An hour in :)
It is bandicoot time once again. Also caddy has a bandicoot suit? Nice. Wait... a bandisuit!
3:26 Everyone alltogether now...  Stoneeer..... Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuunshiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine!!! That is clearly the Shin Getter Robo performing it's signature attack. In fact, there's a LOT of Shin Getter Robo: Armageddon imagery in this knockoff crash game for some reason as Cortex turns into one of the deadliest things in extistence. Can't fool me, game.
Love all your vids keep up the hard work ❤️🫡
4:00 that looks exactly like Kokatorimon from digimon
Babe wake up new caddicarus just dropped!!
28:53 .....Does that battle droid have a vagina?
I'm Brazilian and I had a Karaoto, it's a good famiclone there's a lot of weird stuff in it.
Epic games? Seriously? The company that is for the most part owned by china by the extend of tencent and is thus helping the killings of hong kongers? I unsubscribed from everyone that has taken a sponsorship from them, this is the most i can do with my limited power: markiplier, LTT amongst others. why do people keep shilling Epig games even though they are in direct connection to the chinese government?  all that aside, epig games is not good, like at all. but that's beside the point.
the Cash Bandiloot machine were the bandiconths we enjoyed along the way
Damn you're 28 now. I remember watching you since 2014.  Also I just turned 29 last week.
22:43 funist part
Sewey
Eat fruit
Brazil mentioned
Can u play Rayman legends on the PS4?
13:52
A Caddicarus video that’s less than an hour long? What is this? Pre-2020?
Dang Caddy, 6hr for nothing 😕.
Hei caddicarus you influenze playstasion becous tomorrow PS + there is crash 4 for one of the "game of the month". P.S sorry for my gramatic becous  im one of your italian fan.
Wow, sorry that trip was a bust and for your grated knuckle. Things have not gone well for you since 2020, huh? Still, it was very entertaining and I always love your videos. Wish you the best of luck with your sliced knuckle.
idk why but the "bowl of embedded pet hair" F@#$ING SENT ME
But... isn't Cash Banooca a bootleg?  Caddy, you're part of the problem XD
Thanks, Cad! I just want to say that you never fail to make me laugh and you always make my day! You are amazing!
June 33rd BABY
BLESS YOU
Who made that SFM intro for Bandicoot Month? I wanna subscribe to them so badly.
I think I saw that slot machine somewhere in Skegness once
Hell yeah it's banooca month again
Bash canooka
He really done a 6 hour trip for a joke...and it didn't even go to plan LOL
Sooo, who's gonna tell him about crash mods for different types of games?
Just get a polystation
I'm back for my 7th Bandicampf
Thank you for reminding us Bandicoot month is eternal
the return of the king
EAT FRUIT
YOUR THREE DAYS LATE! but I finally appreciated you decided to look back to bootleg crash games. I wonder your gonna do crash rip-offs next year.
Super Crashing Bird uses Super Mario Galaxy as a base  You can tell by the animations and the voice clips
Cashi Washi is back
That Manchester trip montage has that same vibe as Nick Robinson traveling to Japan in search of answers.
I almost died of laughter sad you couldn't find the cash bandicoot machine you always make my day better caddy
I must admit caddy is very committed to making content and I love it
I too do a little bit of digging on foreign websites and find myself a website, my favourite past time.
no the egg from crash gba 2 is you'r son
No matter how many times I see it, Penistone never loses it's charm.   Also, I'm sure many have commented, but cock can be a term of endearment up north (similar to how women would use "duck"). Bit rare nowadays, mind.
so glad to have you back Caddi. not even 5 mins in and laughing my head off. Missed ya! Thank you!
5:32 I'm glad I'm not the only one that laughed Caddy is funniest daddy
No Smash Brandi’s cooch?
3:56 why is kakatorimon suddenly king of earth
Omg you've got the electric mustang 🤢🤮
that's f o a m not a p ho n e!
Roger roger
I used to play super crashing bird and enjoyed it when I was younger.  Chein mai chaddet oponion.
Dude’s so dedicated that he warped the entire space-time continuum just so it could still release on Bandicoot month. Appreciated as always!
Not even an eighth in the video but 5:26 is already my favourite part.
I'm glad that there is a crash equivalent to backstroke of the west
The fact I immediately noticed that the "king chicken" was a sprite of Kokatorimon from only having a single digimon card of it
I can't wait for the next bandicoot month video to be in June 398th. My clock and dissapointment is ready :D
THIS IS THE GREATEST SUNDAY GIFT EVER CADDY WE LOVE YOU
PORTUGAL WAS MENTIONED. ... AND I REMEMBER THESE BOOTLEG CONSOLES AND I LOVE THEM.
Can't believe that Spons has his own lane. Well, I know where I'm moving.
Me: Now!? But it's June!  Caddy: It's June 33rd, it won't hurt it.  Well, I guess now The Bandicoot Month has started!
Yeah baby another masterpiece
seriously ? "GBC/A" gameboy color/advance dude
Ah, yes, Cadd Bandicarus.
Eat fruit!
3:39 Caddi's voice reminds me of that episode of Inbetweeners when Will goes "fiesty one you are"
Someone needs to find Halalmeat!
Can you take a look at "Puppeteer"?
Can't wait for the next Bandicoot month in August
Hope your finger gets better mate.
thank you for making this caddy , i hope you get better soon!
NEW CADDIC
1:08 man this new evil dead movie looks great
Crash bandicoot vs spongebob, that sounds awesome
I loved this episode way more than I should’ve XD
5:31 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
When your going on a road trip don't forget to EAT FRUIT!!!!🍏🍎🍐🍊🍋🍌🍉🍇🍓🍈🍒🍑🍍🥥🥝🤣
I'm surprised he didn't use bluestack for the android section of the video. But overall 10/10 would Bandiloot again
Today is my birthday, so this video is like a lovely birthday gift for me
Yah, it’s rewind time
If I had driven all that way just to realize I was lied to on the phone I think I would've just cried
b1 droid from star wars he is my favourite
Loved the new intro
It’s the funny British man!
You braved Hattersley just for the purpose of a single joke, that is serious dedication to one's craft.
“Crash bandicoot is going to steal my location data”  - Caddy(2022)
God this is funny af
6:24 This bootleg is actually based on a template that was also used for a Mario bootleg, a Sonic bootleg, a Lord of the Rings bootleg and a Shrek bootleg. The level layout, controls and music are pretty much all the same. There's a Vinesauce video covering them.
30:33 oof
FINALLY THE BANDICOOT MONTH VIDEO
You could do an entire 4 hour video on how many ripoffs there are on the Google play store. A bunch of them use popular trends, like Poppy Playtime, Squid Game, and Friday Night Funkin'. I hate people sometimes.
ITS BANDICONTH (technically)
"The police mn" caddy every single year
19:10 Is that cross on the top right supposed to be a time relic? Have we found a bootleg Crash game with bootleg platinum relics to collect?
Man, Caddy's physical comedy and comedic timing are so on point here! That phone gag must have needed so many takes to do with a straight face that quickly, absolutely brilliant!
Finally I missed you Caddicarus  Wonderful video as always keep it up!
Yo
23:13  At least it’s in French
Wooooooooooo
29:58 My mom's phone used to have this game on it, only the main character was reskined to Bendy And The Ink Machine.
It must be so awkward walking around the family dinning area looking for a machine that isn't even there. SHE MUST BE HALALMEAT
that intro was glorious!!!
time to watch even this video 10 times or more till the next video
It'll be a cold day in hell when Caddy returns:
WHHHHHOOOOOO YEAAAAA BAABBY THATS WHAT I BEAN WAITING FOR
Okay this intro is a masterpiece
As an American, it feels weird to see someone drive on the right side of a car.
Nunca fui tão orgulhoso em ser brasileiro
22:52 caddy neurotoxins/does a gladOS to his daughter
Day 2 of asking for the odd world of oddworld
I swear that zombies run game was a knock off of another mobile game that was actually really good from what I remember
Here for my “within the hour” ticket!
👏👍
Hope this video isn't as offensive as the "Jesus games" one!
25:57 Well I guess you can say it... CRASHED!
I might as well come up with my own Crash Bandicoot rip-off/parody game. I call it Craig Bonzacoot. I know Smash Brandy’s Cooch exist in the Last of Us universe.
wooo new caddy uploads are always nice
1:36
Train Station 2
00:02 Caddy's neighbours POV: That weirdo is trying to parkour over a fence dressed as a cartoon fox... Shall we call the police?
Wooo hooo happy June 33rd everyone Banooca Month/Day!!!
*EAT FRUIT!*
When this showed up in my recommended, a grin slowly formed on my face :) P.S: Happy Bandicunth Month!
For some reason I thought the age gap between us was bigger 😭😆
Also I remember my little brother picking up a psp bootleg with crash it’s like the jungle book game except with crash characters. It was a weird moment…
Our god has returned once again
3:57 Oh hello Cockatrimon. Didn't expect a Digimon to pop up in here.  No this isn't a joke, that's a really bad Cockatrimon sprite.
One hour club!
Caddicarus: What is the cure for aids?  Uka Uka: That’s not my problem.
Since YouTube has lately been pushing for short content by creators that uploads very often, it’s nice to see someone go in the direct opposite direction. Especially someone who is as good at it as mr Banookaman himself.
AHHHHHHHH (I haven’t watched the video but I am commenting to support you in the algorithm) AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
yay bandiconth
Oh yeaaaaahhhhh it’s bandiconth!
The chaos has returned
Earliest I've ever caught one of your videos> can't wait to see what you've got in store! Also, hoping that knuckle heals up soon  Edit: it was hilarious, thank you for giving us this gift for your birthday, Caddy.
I can’t believe they put shin getter robo in a crash bandicoot bootleg
It's amazing too see another video from you so soon especially during bandicoot month and I hope your hand is feeling better after the cheese grater, love you Caddy
My condolences about that trip not paying off and the injury.  There is however, a fun fact about that Game Boy Advance bootleg. It is the far buggier version of an asset flip, of a downgraded port, of a SNES Digimon Bootleg, that was already clunky and buggy. That specific bootleg game has been asset flipped so many times it's been a Mario game, a Sonic game ( The infamous Sonic 3 Fighter Sonic one ), a TMNT game, a Rayman game, and even stuff like an Ultraman game. All of them are bad and don't even have the amount of content the SNES "original" had. These ones are obviously derided by bootleg enthusiasts as well due to the laziness and shoddiness of it all.
Happy June 23rd and a good ol Bandiconth!
"No copyright law in the universe is going to stop me!" -The bootleggers, probably.
I have on regrets in meeting you Friend Should the day come that we are not together You will continue to shine like Gold In my memories
YOOOO BANDICONTH
3:24 I never thought I would ever  see  a crossover of crash bandicoot and Shin getter robo!
Happy 33rd of June people!
22:12 THAT MEAT IS SO NOT HALAL MODE!
It doesnt matter how long it takes to Cad to make a video, you know its gonna be good.
Bandicunth ftw! Or is it Junedicoot? I forget...
22:46 lol
22:20 ah yes my favourite youtuber, halalmeat5000
Caddy’s videos always make me laugh and smile
bandibootleg
E A T  F R U I T
British Jesus has blessed us again with more Crash Banooka content!    edit: only caddick would willingly drive 3 hours to a new place for crash banooka
10:53 that's Ant dude's voice
Wow... nice intro
Yeahhh bandicoot month is back \owo/ I cant wait to see your next videos
Why does anyone wanna sponsor him lol it was hilarious but he posted his old tweets lol
“Eat fruit.” The solution to all the world’s problems
LET'S GO NEW CADDDYYY
Banooca is back
If crash on the titans isn't on this list then im dissapointed
2:40 I have no doubt he actually drank whatever concoction that was
POOOOOG
Maybe next year, he'll talk about fangames
Oh my god there are tears in my eyes from laughing at "EAT FRUIT"
all of the crash android games you play exist here in the us too which is weird considering some games are region restricted between the 2 country's
I like how before he even showed up, I knew SPONS was about to appear.
BANDICUNTH
you have NO idea of the absolutelly frankeistein consoles we have back in brazil
ok the shot with your eyes and the glasses absolutely killed me
Moment of silence for all the phones destroyed in the making of this video
Jontron clone
It was made in June, so it counts, right?
2:29 man the Ford ranger in Europe looks better than the one we got here in the us of the a it's smaller and more nimble like the older Ford rangers
I think because of the high energy of these videos I laugh more at random things
Not another Crash video bro! 😆
Is  is that Shin Getter Robo?
18:51 i nearly spited my cereal with milk from laughter
RETURN OF THE KING
Very happy we could work with ya caddy, means alot!
He's starting to look like Crash
11:19 actual translation: Dr. Cortex kidnaps Crash's girlfriend - Taiwna (bad translation), in order for Crash to fulfill his sinister plan.  Crash - refuses and goes to save his beloved.....  joke with Google translator just killed me.
I was born on bandicoot month 2nd June 1995 so I'm part of the June Squad also Crash was one of my favourite games growing up too
5:33 killed me so much XD i wheezed so hard.
The king has returned!
We are closing to one million subscribers. Which means we are closing to legendary Spyro video! My body is ready!
The Tom mask and yell were the best part.
look guys, it’s crish bundicort
Wow you are a life saver man. Today I get positive for covid and have a bit heavier symptoms. I really needed this, thank you!
Plot twist this is the first appearance of King Chicken before CTR Nitro Fuelled
Will this be the only time you cover the scuffed mobile games?
18:51 when U see this 👀
“Alter evil to be straight.”  No.
The almighty  C A S H   B A N O C A
18:15 Train Station 1 is actually a real game. I know because I play it regularly. It's actually a pretty fun game lol Also it's not exclusive to phones. You can also play it on PC
B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-BANDICOOT!
Bout bannokin time
Welp, they used a getter robo armaggedon shot in the first bootleg compressed down. im laughing really hard
Nice
Cool
You're the only YouTuber I know who I like watching the sponsored segment
Thank you so much for quality content
3:56 Is that... kokatorimon?
EAT FRUIT!!
Another good video as always!
Man I've missed these. Nothing quite beats the silliness you can find in a Caddy video
Nothing like getting thru some personal tragedy by chilling with Cad The Chad for 40 minutes!
Was that a blooper 5:27
Oh this should be *fun* .
1:40 look him goe
Happy birthday, Jim.
Please make another one of these videos again also I watch the whole thing by the way
The amount of absolute got busters per minute have increased to an impossible degree, I made a horrible mistake of drinking before watching this Cad, it’s so funny I could very well die.
Woaaaaah caddy
I made my widest open smile in a while after seeing the video in my feed. Keep it up :P
Happy extension of bandiconth
Thank you sincerely for the level of care you put into your work. It really makes a difference!
4:23 Baddy origin story
Jim do you have a discord server?
GREAT VIDEO DUDE! and it was a pleasure working for you!
3:55 Huh… that’s Kokatrimon from Digimon. Weird…
14:03 you mean Almond milk?
11:20 Translation:  Doctor Cortex kidnapped Crash's Girlfriend Tawna so that Crash would do his sinister design. Crash refused and went to save his beloved
Man this is exactly the upload needed for today!  Almost at 1M too!!
I been living in RU during my childhood and crossed by ‘crash IV’ on GBA,  it was very disappointing after ‘huge adventure’ and ‘n-tranced’ lol 😅
Awwww I want this as job 😞
Everytime I think "Wow, no way can he pick a better/funnier topic than the last video." And sure enough he always does.
I was not expecting Caddy to use an SFM animation in the opening. I legit thought it was a clip from the game until halfway through the animation
Crash bandicoot is dead yet
5:27 I want those magnification glasses gadget.
SUBSCRIBE!! Caddy should've been at a Million subs a long time ago.  Get Caddy a million!!! #SubCaddy
Thank you Caddi, I’ve been feeling really sad after the death of Technoblade. I needed this video to cheer me up again.

For the next bandicoot episode you should do a documentary on bandicoots
11:07 Christopher Walken
17:29 My God, the man in the cafe in those Nord VPN advertisements, it was Cash Banooka all along!
He's back.
How many games/systems has this man destroyed?
Just when you think daddy caddy couldn't find anything else to make a video for bandicoot month he goes and finds something to talk about. Cyoor.
Grate to see you back Caddy.
Caddy is only 28....are you sure caddy? Cos I'm pretty sure you are in your late 30s and in denial.
Alex Jones thing is good though 👍
New caddy video? YES
One of the best weirdos ever!! Nice!! Great to see you Caddy!
17k views 20 mins ago
Jesus that was fast huh
5:33 needs to be a meme template.
Its not bandicunth anymore
We’re not even two minutes in and I’m already laughing you are a little late though
YUS OUR LORD AND SAVIOR OF THE BANUKA HAS GRACED US
Ok but why illegal? Like
I'm a simple man, i see a new caddicarus upload and i know how great it is to be alive again
I wouldn't trust epic games, Cadd..
the king is back
Oh my god, i had one those but they were called poly station.. holy shit caddy
Just saw this on my Start page and was like "That sounds fun, I don't remeber watching this.......... wait, could it be!?!?" Happy to see more
IM FINALLY EARLY
7:28 man burned his cash banooca for a joke. Respect 25:15 and broke a phone 27:48 and another one
BOUNS ROUND
1:40 Why does this look like GTA5 gameplay footage?
Let’s gooooooo new Caddy vid!!!!!!
Holy shit those magnified eyes at 5:30 absolutely killed me, I hope the rest of the video follows suit because this has been fantastic so far Update: You're god damn right it was - Stan's Phrase also sent me
This has to be the video that puts Caddy to 1 Million Subs! Just give it time and we will see a Spyro Review
5:27
"This cartridge violates the geneva convention"
How does Caddy keep making intros that are better than most youtuber's entire videos.
June 33rd is a new added day because Bandicoot month is sacred and always happens in June doesn't matter
5:31 this single frame...thats it...no joke...this frame
Lost my sides at this one
25:00, AVGN: You can just walk over it?
Wait a second, caddy didnt upload a video after 6 years?   THE MESSIAH  IS HERE!!!
STOP EVERYTHING NEW CADDICARUS. Happy Bandicoot month!
holy shit
oh my it is cash
THAT'S RIGHT BITCHES   *B A N D I C O N T H   I S   B A C K ! ! !*
So is Bandicoot month just in July now?  I mean twice in a row is row COULD be coincidence.  I guess next year will confirm it.
0:16 B A N D I C O O T 3 AND KNUCKLES
I'm so happy this month is back. B B B *BANDICOOT*
I love this new intro. I got nothing else to say. It's just that good. Mittens, you're a goddamn legend.
Perfect timing for June 33rd
6:27 The Real Crash 4
You say that you have no excuse for being unable to find even one of these games after the PS1 accessories video, but I believe you've earned a break after all of the hell you've gone through, and especially considering the subject of this video.
You can do it! You can reach 1 mil!
Hope your finger feels better Caddy!
Caddy: “the month is June”  Me: “Okay I believe you “
yumi yumi in my caddy muddy waddy tummi
It's literally 23 pm and I have school tomorrow, but f it. This will be worth it!
Love that interactment with the cameraman where they share a laugh
Since Caddicarus is nearing 1M subscribers. I’m hoping that his next video will potentially be “The Smouldering World of Spyro Games.”
14:25 Portugal coming in clutch🇵🇹🔥🔥🔥
It's ALWAYS bandiconth somewhere
Ah June 33rd, my favorite day of the year.
Caddy's uploads are now a special event that deserves the appropriate celebration
7:27 Poor plushie....
Bandiconth is back!
Finally Bandi month
13:49 iS iT tOo LaTe NoW tO sAy SoRrY
9:03 “hello, I’m SPONS!!!😂
It’s funny because we are only gunna get one video for this hole summer so it should just be called bandicoot day ha
3:26 That's straight up just Shin Getter Robo, a Japanese mecha, doing an attack from what looks like a Super Robot Wars game.
CASH BANOOKA
LES GOO NEW VIDEO YIPPEEEEE
I remember when Caddi was so skinny
9:10 i thought that on the vaccum is going to be paper written on it "dont care"
as a brazillian, i can say, if it was only cash banooca who got into bootlegs here mario, megaman, sonic and even spyro got bootleg'd by brazillians: illegal portuguese translarions(that if was not illegal i would support), copycats and a lot of bad toys
2:33 class 185!
Bruh how is he not gonna talk about M&M'S SHELL SHOCKED
YESSSS!!! My little injured bebe is back
Ok the magnified eyes bit was funny
Caddy you have actually just made my evening.. I have an excuse to stop scrolling YouTube bored.
3:48 Evangelion?
Time for another die of laughter fest.
Cash banooca the bootleg
YES HES BACK, AGAIN
I’m very sick at the moment of watching this and I’m already having a much better day thanks to you Caddy
@3:55 That's...that's a Digimon
YEAHHHJ
OH GOD YES!
More like Dash Bilby.
Finally the video of  Bandicoot month is arrived on June 33
“Do you have crash bandicoot?” “No, but I have Smash Bazooka”
Shorter video, but it doesn't make it any less good! Another modern classic, my friend, well done!!
Oh man why did you post this just as I took a prescription sleeping pill 💊
Caddy's hair changes more often than my love life.
ITS CASH BANOOCA
happy bandicont- wait... 'uploaded Jul 3, 2022'  >:-(
Jajaja
-IS BANDICOOT MONTH -But is july -I DON'T CARE, IS BANDICONTH
Hey Caddy, sometime in the future, can you look at all the 3D Pac man games, both console and handheld?
Absolutely love that new Bandicoot logo.
I hope I don't catch Eboler and die
Bandicunth, in July, again
The Caddiconth is Backdiconth
We need a compilation of the Pac-Man games that are not the main arcade like ones or Pac-Man Championship Edition
And the new best S P O N S segment goes to- ooh a cornflake!
Nice
holy shit mom new caddicarus vido
Happy Bandiconth everyone.
The BOOTS were EVERYTHING 😂
5:33 Caddy and Cerys (thanks for the comments telling me how to spell her name) are usually so good and holding in laughter at all of the stupidly hilarious moments in this show, so I love how they literally just couldn't for this part. Like, how do you NOT laugh at Caddy's eyes here?
So close to 1 mil…. I want my Spyro reviews!!!
6:41 wow the only teaser to super ghostbusters 2 and it’s made by caddicarus
Happy Bandicoot Month, Caddi.
I was just re-watching PS1 accessories and BOOM! New Caddy!
CADDY PLS MAKE THE SHALLOW WORLD OF BARBIE GAMES
Crush badooka
woah, was not expecting to see the video uploaded this early-
Whenever caddy uploads a video, you know it’s gonna be good
bootlegger boogie crash bandicoot edition :)
cash banooca in 4k
damn the sfm intro be looking clean though
u always crack me the fup  hugs from mexico
Yes, posted on the 33rd day of bandicoot month. Definitely not in another month.
JUNE 33RD!!!!
Ah yes. Bandiconth.
This upload is what I needed, there's a massive thunderstorm and there's a blackout in the whole neighborhood because of it, watching this on my phone in bed will help with the boredom. Hope your finger is good, Caddy   Fun fact: the dead beaver screen at 5:17 is taken from an arcade fighting game developed by Hudson called "Kabuki Klash: Far East Of Eden" and it's a tanuki that shows up when you defeat your character in a mirror match
5:32 Okay, what are those and where can I get them? They're hilarious 😂
Les go 🚶
Those are trash fake Crash games lol
Besides that d video is fine
Smile on my face after seeing the notification for this video :3
One knuckle sacrificed for a new video
Caddy to 1M before 2022 is over 🙌🏽

I like the new intro for crash bandicoot month
I honestly love youtubers picking a month to dedicate to their fav gaming franchise.
caddicarus doing a "short 40 minutes video" is still 2 times longer than the average long 20 minute video 😂 this man is a king!!!
Thing That I Love In Your Videos is Your Humor And The Gaming Knowledge That You Have
Fall guys is not a real game Fortnite isn't either
A surprise to be sure, but a welcomed one.
Happy june 33rd everyone
My favourite crash game boy game is Crash Bandicoot Xylophone Saxophone!

If you do a con in the UK dressed as Crash, I’ll cosplay as Coco and that’s a promise. 🤣
This is the video that'll earn you a million subscribers for sure! Only 21K away!!
Daddy Caddy dropped some Gold for us again <3

bashem crashem
5:27 is the funniest thing you've ever done, I'm totally 🤣ing over here
I love how big googly eyes are enough to make Caddy break character.
👍👍👍
I knew you would make this video. I freaking knew it. There’s really no other thing to cover
I honestly hate the fact that I can never be as funny as Caddy sometimes
Yes! Another Caddicarus video!
Woah
You are by far the most elaborate and funny reviewer that i have ever seen in my life
ANNNND you made my month! Been really hard lately...this helps.
Every Caddy video I’ve seen is worth the wait. Caddy if you are reading this thank you! Hope you are feeling better.
Another great video as always 🤣
Finally my country of  brazil being represented as it is. A country filled with piracy
Happy june 33rd everyone, what a way to finish this excellent month of crash bandiboy22222

3:41 sorry but is that a pixelated image of a yugioh creature or something?
I was actually waiting for this for a while disappointed that it never came but now my day has been made

Subbed to you back in 2018 and I've loved seeing your channel evolve and grow. Keep up the great work as always!

How needs Bandicoot month- we can have a Bandicoot year!!!!
Two Caddicarus videos within a month of each other?! What have we done to deserve such a wonderful gift.
Nice intro for Bandicoot Month.
IT’S CASH BANOOCA!
Y'know it may be rare when he uploads but anytime he does Caddy always makes me laugh.
Love that new Bandicoot Month intro
Under 5 minutes club where you at?
June 33rd & Bandicoot Month stays strong
I miss the... CADDYS RETROSPECTIVESSSSSSS intro. How he's come a long way :P
Silly Caddy! Everything is legal if you don't give a damn!
Thanks, Conner. You got to Caddy. Edit: ConnorTheWaffle. You know what to do.

Daddy caddy had blessed us once again 🙏
Crash Bandicoot in boots is probably the thing I've ever seen
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees cadyyyyyyyyyyyyy is baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack
This was surprisingly sooner than I expected. Nice job, Cad the Chad. I personally don’t care how long it takes for these videos to release, as long as they actually release.
Wow can't wait for this video to disappear for whatever reason only to come back later in time
3 seconds in and Caddy is already jumping over a fence. This is gonna be fun ride, I can already tell.
NEW CADDY 💕 I've been watching so many of your old videos lately. So much charm and comedy. They're always a source of comfort. Glad you're back at it!
Yay it finally here
You uploaded this just as clock ticked to 00.01 where I live, so technically this years Bandiconth is 4 days late! Unacceptable!!!      Not really, glad to have you back, Cad
AAAAAAA this sunday is better now, but june is over!!! as a gay and an crash bandicoot enjoyer im sad
Gooseman
It is no longer cash banooca  It’s now bash canooca
I swear. These videos keep getting better with every upload. He keeps one-upping himself
Jeez 28 years already caddy?!?! I’ve been watching your vids since you were 17….and I’m only 20
Thanks for the new video Daddy Caddy! I'm going to enjoy it!  I personally do think every month is the time for Cash Banooca!
I clicked that notification SO FAST! thank you Caddy! I’m sure it’ll be amazing as always!
Guess it is June 33rd
I swear, you go through so much agony but you still deliver amazing content. Bless.
Hey Caddy, i think a video on crappy superhero games would be an interesting idea
Yes More Caddy!
Definitely a good way to start the month of July 😎
Holy shit, that intro. This is going to be a good one.
CASH BANOOKA?
Great intro my man.
I’ve been waiting for this ❤ hope the knuckles getting better caddy!
I chose the best time to wake up
Yoooooo I can finally experience bandicoot month
Perfect timing. I needed a video to laugh today.
The best way to describe Caddy is if JonTron joined Monty Python’s Flying Circus
perfect timing brother, love ur vids! :D
Well something good did come of your last video taken down.  Now I drop everything to watch your stuff when I get a notification just in case it gets yeeted from the internet a few hours later.  Maybe Susan’s been playing 4D chess all this time.
*HE'S BACK!!~* 🥳  And so soon this time... Welp.  *CRASH BANOOCA TIEM* 🎉  (Also, Brazilian Bootlegs, huh?)
A video that isn't over an hour long? What form of heresy.....     (Not complaining, I'm lactating with excitement for a new Caddy video)
Hey caddy! I’m so excited for this video ! I’m the guy that asked about Tak! It be awesome if one day you played Tak and the Power of Juju Tak 2 the Staff of Dreams and Tak the Great Juju Challenge on caddy plays! Tak’s a masterpiece! Keep up the great work!

Yes, Bandicoot Month is June, but I cheese-grated my whole knuckle off recently. I wish I was joking. I'm in agony. Let's just say it's June 33rd. This won't hurt though - Fall Guys is now free! Download here: https://pixly.go2cloud.org/SH3I4  *Also, the 4K quality of the video is still processing - please give it some time if you wanna see the video in the best possible quality!
