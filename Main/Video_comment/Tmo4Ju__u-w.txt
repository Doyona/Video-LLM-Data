The reason I love this is because Ray always has something extremely funny to say and roast people very harshly and here he is very shy and anxious
I Have Started Watching Deeper In Ray's Content. I Haven't Watched A Lot But I Feel Like I've Been Here For Years, And I'm Happy For Ray.
I thought it was that trend to see how honest they are by giving them a spoon of salt to see if they say it’s bad because of how bad the song was
So sweet 🤧😥
Bro she's beautiful
I was hoping it said “including you!”
this has to be the most wholesome thing I've seen all day
Ellie Kemper vibes from her ❤️
