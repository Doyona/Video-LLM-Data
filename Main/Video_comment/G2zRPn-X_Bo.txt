che schifo il  lione. serie b?
موسى التعمري هو لاعب كبير له حس بالتهديف
This is seriously the official League 1 channel? It's a textbook example of how NOT to make highlight videos. This terrible announcer has zero passion, zero excitement for the game. He even says what's going to happen in the clip before it happens! Truly god awful highlights for a great game.
Two players scoring 4🥵
1-0 Alexandre Lacazette (31 min) 1-1 Elye Wahi (40 min) 1-2 Elye Wahi (41 min) 1-3 Elye Wahi (53 min (PK)) 1-4 Elye Wahi (55 min) 2-4 Alexandre Lacazette (59 min) 3-4 Dejan Lovren (70 min) 4-4 Alexandre Lacazette (82 min) 5-4 Alexandre Lacazette (90+10 min (PK))
Most boring comantator oat

Match of the season in the UberEATS 😂
mosa tamare موسا تعمري

Amazing! :O
ROUGE ET BLEU❤💙LYONNAIS EST NOTRE CŒUR
League of farmers in Africa in Europe  😅😅😅
Worst commentary ever no hype
Lyon always playing entertaining football
Go ! 👉🏻 Lacazette en équipe de France !!! 🇲🇫
Imagine arguing this wasn’t a foul
4 goals by Wahi; 4 goals by Lacazette; Lyon was down 1-4 at 55 minutes and then won. Only in the PES of the golden years I saw such a thing.
التعمري جاكم خبوا عيالكم
الاردنيه اثبتو وجود😂😂
I love that shit
cant believe im watching uber eats highlights 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Pure farmers league
Commentator needs to learn not to spoil the action before we see it. Amateurish
Good sport
Allez Lyon!
My leader, Alex Lacazette
Johann LEPENANT🤦‍♂
Am happy for laca as arsenal fan
The game game: 🤩🤩🤩 The commentator : 💀💀💀
Great game, worst commentator
This game was unreal
This match would've been even more amazing if it ended 4-4 with 4 goals for the strikers of both teams Incredible match ⚡
Facts, last game going this way, down 3 goals and winning in france was in 98, and last double quadruple goals in one game by two players is since the 50’s in France. Record game
Wahi: scores four goals.  Lacazette: "Finally, a worthy opponent. Our battle will be legendary !"
Montpellier are used to this score. Just remeber 1998, lost 4-5 against OM after having 4-0 at half-time 😂😂😂
It would have been a great video if they would have actual game commentary  w game , L league 1 admins
The noise of the stadium is very quiet. The atmosphere is lost.
Most normal Ligue 1 match
Watching Lepenant play is like watching Harry Maguire in Midfield lol
Ziyech in city possible ❤❤❤
Incroyable
This was the prem league people would be making this video trending..
Give wahi a point atleast
Musa Al-Tamari is coming😂❤
Bro what a shit commentary this guy leaking goal before it happens
I guess the French leuge really delivered 💀
Epic comeback
once a gunner always a gunner. love laca top bloke. pure passion.
So happy Lacazette didn't end up like Aubameyang!!!!
It ain't over til the fat lady sings.
Boring commentary
LAKAZZET BOOOM
Great game.
The commentary is shocking. It's like a spoiler for every goal..
Fixed matches are real
А чего полтора инвалида на стадионе? 😂
Worst commentaries
🔥Lacazette 🔥❤️💙
こりゃ、すげーわ。
yes lacaaaa
tollisooooo my cm
This game sucked. Ok, 9 goals but were was the defense? Ligue 1 has poor playing style (and that’s why they aren’t a top league and that’s even why no team has won the champion in a while)
This game was so fixed and funny😂
Absolutely crazy match 🤣🤣🤣
Lacabloodclatzet!!!!
This match deserves a better commentary.
Керемет ойын болды рақмет
I am so sad about Montpellier but lets take a word that Dejan Lovren is a king of great comebacks. He and his teammates produces them all the time (Liverpool v BVB,Croatia vs Denmark,England and soo many more)
ワイが1番だよ
Where VAR actually works
Madness
Pulau Gili Ketapang, Probolinggo, Jawa Timur 🇮🇩
Великолепный комбэк 👍👍👍👍
Комментатор как будто сериал смотрит. Ноль эмоций, как будто обычная игра и ничего выдающегося не происходит на поле
As a gunners fans, seeings lacazette doing so fine at his hometown , i feel happy for him..hopefully he wins the golden boots award
Whats wrong with this commentator?
At least out the time and the scoreboard. It’s not hard…
Clicking just for the highlights, boy, I was wrong. What a game of football...
Peminatnya dikit kenapa ramai yg nonton
Очень люблю такого рода матчи ☺💗
The most depressing commentary I've ever heard
Bradley Barcola amazing....  🎉🎉🎉
You gotta feel bad for Wahi😢
Wow ❤❤❤
Lovren ❤❤❤
Come en of the season then teams play they best
This is Football!
Aubayang and lacazeet
Barcola est le meilleur joueur lyonnais actuellement quel!! Jeune doué d'expérience ✨⚽♥️✅💪
Great game, but it's such a farmers league. Terrible keepers and defenses
Commentary is a spoiler alert.
Watched on mute, why would the “commentator” tell you what’s gonna happen before it happens??
The commentator is awful
Barcola is the next T. Henry
pazzesco
this commentator should never comment such a great game again, no emotions nothing. get a new job pls
this channel needs a better manager
I want this kind of performance tomorrow with Madrid vs city 3-3 or 4-4 or 5-3
Arsenal should have given him one more year
OLLLLLL❤❤ meilleurs match de l'année pour la sortie de Holas bravoooo
Farmers league
Фантастический матч
I would love Ryan Cherki at Man Utd, he offer so much creativity on the left which Anthony doesn't offer. What a player he going to be a supper star.
LacaBoom ❤
I'm so happy for Lacazette. Interesting match.
History match. So sad to see the stadium empty, feeling sorry for the French people and any Lyon or Montpellier fan.
Its football nothing impossible from all of this game
mad
everyone said lacazette was washed but he has more goals than mbappe smh
If dejan lovren is there, a comeback is on
game of the season but this commentator ugh
Hmmmmmm!!! Game of season 2022/2023 in all leagues😂😉😂😂😂😂😂😂
Arsenal legend......
Number 24 for OL is not to start again
Lacazzette is better than Gabriel Jesus
Commentators is dead
مبارات رائعة والمعلق نعسان😂
Number 24 ,the harry Maguire of league 1
Bruh what is with this Martin Tyler ass uninspiring commentary for a game on fire
My first time watching league 1  the commentary 😭😭
Putin army 🪖💛💛💛
Где счёт? Где время?
I've seen matches where two players of the same team get a hatrick but I've never seen two opposing players each score a super hatrick
Ловрен пушка дизельная удар головой я в шоке
Commentary is a joke
Happy for Lacasette.
thank you Laca, i had a ticket on Lyon..:)
Ligue 1 is really the farmers league the defending is so bad
What is even more amazing is the fact that Lyon had no bookings..incredible game, congrats to all players and managers
That is the game of the season on the continent
Montpellier the king of bottlers bottled monumentally against Marseille in 98/99
Things like this prove just how shocking Arsenal’s creativity was during Laca’s time. Instead doing what he does best evidently arriving and being in the box to finish he was forced to play too deep at Arsenal 😤
Match of the year
if only the commentary was as good as the game
Os dois se puxaram, valeu juizao do caralhooooo😡
these guys made a history there  one of the historical come backs ive ever seen
Commentary is terrible...
The second Montpellier goal looks like a FIFA glitch 😅
Worst post match commentary I've ever heard bruh
Le championnat de France s'est réveillé
😳
Lacabloodclaatzettee
Лига 1,лучшая лига в мире
Wahi is a beast. Always sign him in my career mode in Fifa
Fantastic game! I watched live and it was amazing!!! Thanks!!!!
allez ol
Lyakazet's on fire🌋
How shit is french league.Poor quality of play
Ouais les gones c'est ça ❤❤
I can say the commentary is what makes this league look boring
The most impressive game this year!
🤯⚽️👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
เยี่ยม
Wow! Crazy game. Two opposing players scoring 4 goals each in a match.
The commentator is so dead og 💀
Best game of the season with worst commentator of the season. He knew the score and everything. Soulless voice
Great match but boring commentary
Hubo mafia en este partido.  Seguro hubo gente poderosa y millonaria que apostó a Montpellier cuando iba perdiendo 1-0, luego cuando iba 4-1 a favor de Montpellier hicieron cashout o cobraron el pago anticipado de 2 goles de ventaja y apostaron todo su dinero a la remontada del Lyon. Y así es como se vuelven súper millonarios los mafiosos del fútbol.
MAFIA
What a game
огонь!
lacazette should go to national team
So happy for Laca. My favorite playef at Arsenal
Totally not rigged yeah
Barcola was at the heart of everything Soo much work rate exuding from one player 😌
Defending was shambolic to be fair But the strikers where so clinical 🥶
Lacazette leaves arsenal and suddenly remembers how to score!
Lacazette 🤣🤣🤣🤣❤️👊🏾
👍
I notice the player ratings gave the Montpelier player Wahi 8.8 for scoring  4  but lacazette get 10 for scoring 4 interesting  if u ask me  !
Lacca ❤️🫶 once a gooner always a gooner. 🐐
very often french speakers are so bad, that even the french official ligue 1 channel has english speakers
Who gets the match ball?
How is that a penalty? They're grabbing each other. Play on. Ridiculous.
what a shitty commentary !  0 emotions
Frankly, that was shit commentary
6000th like🔄 %00Ɩ lɐ ᴉuᴉlossnW ouoS
Insane match!
That was goosebump
lyon no 24 need to get back to academy asap .... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 or lease he will become upamaguire or faes
4 goal by Mistakes😂😂😂😂
Very bad highlight..no show time....
Match🔥
great game, but this commentary is agonizingly boring
Lacazette amazing ❤
What a match, what a great come back.
Wish that laca been this good when still wearing arsenal shirt
This game had everything goals comebacks hattricks of goals and assists professionalism game of the season imo.
👏🏻👏🏻🏆🫶⭐️
They call this farmers league 😂 Ronaldo fans😂
Nice game but the highlights is disappointing. The commentator have no passion in football, no time and score shown.
Wahi to Milan please
Una pagliacciata
Comentator go sleep
On a side note, while the French league have produced some of the best defenders the world has ever seen, I think while they're playing in the French league, they're horrendously lazy in defending. Could as well be among the reasons the National team have no starters in the defence playing in the French league. I mean, look at shambolic defending stinking all over the place. Jeez!
Unbelievable! How does a heavily-bandaged player run so much, jumps over tackles like it's nothing, and then scores 4 goals? How?! OMG!
Best game 2023
These guys play in slow motion no intensity at all
OL ❤ 💙
Come back  is Real
The commentary is lame asf😂😂😂
Looks like Kreisliga B Gelnhausen to me
2 players scored 4 goals each, unreal ! and comeback in the 99 min !!!
Yes alex love from arsenal❤
I KNEW THERE'D BE ONE CLOWN FROM EPL TO TALK ABOUT THEIR CLOWN LEAGUE
I saw them this whole lyon team playing at dubai very happy to see that 5-4 win omg lacazette
We always missed Peter drury
Worst commentator with no energy
Lyon came back from losing 1-4 to winning 5-4!  What a comebacks, what a match...  One of the top 3 matches of 2023 ⚽️ 💟
I envy those who watched this match live.
Even my balls have more passion than these commentators, am i watching Golf?
Thank you Lyon for making win my Betting Ticket 🎉🎉
กลองหลังมงลิเยรั่วสุดๆนำก่อนโดน5ลูกรัวๆ
Ашшалееть
epic match    https://youtu.be/4Bm6NoKFZt8
What a brilliant match ❤
Incredibile
Commentating is so dead lol!😅
Who went home with the match ball?
One of the greatest comeback in history of football
Soft pen but amazing drama
Barcola 3 assists as well
Nmr 24 lolll
The asshole who was grabbing Lacazette the whole time in the box got what he deserved. Loved VAR for that.
Plot Twists after Plot Twists 😮
Il 5 a 4 è un furto, la partita era finita!!! Vergogna!!!
Non sono i calci di rigore è successo tutto nel tempo regolare
Lyon ❤❤❤❤
Suprr 👍
I gotta ask, who on earth edits the starting sequence of graphics and lineups together and thinks "Yeah that's a good job". It looks awful, barely shows for .4 of a second and cuts in and out so jarringly.  Feels weird to see such low effort from a top league
Imagine leaving the stadium at 4-1 and finding out it ends 4-5 😂
Elye Wahi going hit for hit with Lacazette. what a game
What a game?! 👏
Ridicolous penalty
what a disgusting commentary on interesting game
It's like seeing a women football match for all the defensive error and missed passagges
Mavdidi and lacazette
Amazing football from both teams,too bad Montpellier got into the comfort zone,As always,Lacazzete bringing the goods🎉
Che giocatore lacazette
I cashed out my bet when 4-1 down only the bet to go through,,what an embarrassment
Wahi vs Lacazette
WTF I'm shocked
Ligue 1 the league of capitulation😂😂🤣 Merci
Unimaginable score 🎉❤ felicitations OL ❤
By miles the best ligue 1 game of the season!ALLEZ LES GONES🇫🇷IN LAURENT BLANC WE BELIEVE
Nice defense by Mtp😅😅
farmers league lol
I must admit this is the most 🔥 game all season!!!
Remettez un français pour les commantaires, l'ancien avait bien plus d'énergie !!
Lacalaca
Lacazette my man
der Kommentator wäre beim Golf besser aufgehoben
Defense in Ligue 1 🤡
🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 leaving my comment here because it's gonna be classic in the future

iNCREDIBLE MATCH
Hi name should be LacaNETTE, he can't stop scoring!
This match should have had Peter Drury as the Commentator
The commentator is boring asf
FIFA 23 Results 🥴
So fixed match
Fantastic game!
Crazy 2 goalscorer 👏👍
Number 24 in Lyon is man of the match buahahaha.
There’s nothing like big gap , most of these European leagues are competitive, that what make champions league harder , that also the reason why Ajax can beat Madrid
That's my boy Lacaboom💥🚀 love him❤
Boring commentary .they put boring stuff on highlights too.
Warra Match🇧🇩
If laca can performed well at ligue 1, no wonder its easy league.
Normales Weekend League Spiel😅

This is my game of the season world over
Лион👍👍👍
Why Does Ligue 1, have boring Commentators, how can a game like this not excite someone
This commentator sucks.

9 goal thriller  This deserves extended highlights
Barcola's assists are insane! A hat-trick of assists, too!
Who went with the official match ball
lacazette is the star, but i just want to say, bradley barcola, what a young star
Commentator 😴😴
