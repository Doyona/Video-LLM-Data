That second goal from Wrexham Wow just WOW!!!!
We need a Darvel vs Wrexham match
That black guy in Coventry pls what’s his name , the guy on loc that scored the free kick , he is a good player. Tho
Oh-ho-ho-hooo
Palmer played ridiculous
Wrexham are a Championship team at the moment, they just need to prove it.   Once they get out of the national league, and by god I hope they do - because they deserve it! They'll steam through divisions 1 & 2. Unsure of how they'll fair in the Championship, and they might even bounce back down to division 1, but they're doing unbelievable things at the moment, and the trajectory is only up!
Why force women to commentate? Shocking awful !
What a match, what a story, what a game…
Battle of the ex-Cardiff keepers
Ding dong
Non league football teams are getting out of hand now 😭😂😪
coventrys keeper has some right lag
That post is a paid actor like their owners😂😂
As an Arsenal fan, these are two of my favourite teams: Coventry because that was the last game I saw at Highbury and they were relegated that year and their fans were fantastic, as was the team, and Wrexham because that was my late welsh Dad's team. I don't buy the idea that you only like one team, but I must say Arsenal trumps these two, but this was a great tie and Wrexham have form for beating higher opposition, including Arsenal in the FA cup one year. All in all this was a must watch for me and i really enjoyed it. A big well done to both squads.
Is it too hard for UK technicians to put a dam clock on the screen ? Or does time not matter in english football ?
this commentator is epic haha
That Coventry goalkeeper 🤡
Santa Clause commentating
Commentator for every goal be like: H-H-HWOAARRRRRR
Great work boys!!! 🔥 🔥 🔥
Nobody:   The commentator: WO HO!
Onesies YET AGAIN!
WE'VE GOT PAUL MULLLIN, SUPER PAUL MULLLLIIINNNNNNN
I only hope the worst for everything that has anything to do with Coventry. A place where snakes and rats hide to and bred from
Paul Mullen to sunderland 😉😂
This commentator needs a raise fantastic job he did
Very unlucky Coventry, a great comeback to get two goals after a red card
At last Basil Brush returns!
Luke Young has been outstanding all season but this was one of his finest nights in a Wrexham jersey. What a player he has been for us through the ups and the downs.
This is why we love this cup So many shocks  But some absolute classics like this one gg's Wrexham
Who was the commentator?
Well done Wrexham 👏  both keepers had nightmares but great game to watch 👍
Far better commentary than PL
Proving why fa cup is the greatest ever cup tournament I just watched stevenage beat villa
Things like this is why the FA Cup is the best tournament in England
love the commentators reactions
Wrexham - replace your goalkeeper.
The commentator loves goals!!!😅😅🤣🤣😁😁
Mark Howard is actually an  unreal goalkeeper. Definitely helped keep Carlisle up last season and we love him for it; always going to remember that penalty save against Oldham. Glad to know he's still performing well.   🎶 England, number 1! England, England, number 1! 🎶
Well done Wrexham
How did Cov not get a penalty? Bidwell was rugby tackled!
Momentum is a massive thing with any club and you guys now have it …..from a tangerine…
Livarpool stunned wolves and the world with the draw at wolves   Even though Liverpool fans thought they had two world class players in Andy Carroll MK2 and Ryan Babel MK2
That was an insane game wow
See Ryan Reynolds money starting do wonders I see lols
What a great game of football
The Wrexham wall has a strong foundation that stops it from jumping!
4:32 that GK is literally me when i went in goal once🤣🤣🤣
Oh-ho-ho! WTF.
Hopefully Wrexham get a big PL club or just keep quietly progressing into the next round. Ever since Ryan Reynolds took over I only want them too win 🤣👏
Wrexham only just hung on there.Hats off to Cov for that fightback with 10 men.
Commentary is abysmal
Commentator was so good!
What a game .well done Wrexham from the real sky blues Manchester city 👍
That Coventry keeper is shite!
I do not know when the clock was removed from the match highlights, but I am quite sure that it would not cause information overload to watchers to know when an event had happened.
3:13 why did no one in the wall not jump? They only had to jump a few inches and that would have been blocked easy.
Well done Wrexham, you all fought well. Unlucky Coventry, you all also fought well..but needed that little touch of magic in the 18yard box, final third etc. That Coventry free kick was sublime.  All in all, a fantastic game to watch. Edge of the seat stuff.   Wrexham, good luck moving forward.
the commentator was awesome
That Palmer, jeez what a player.
This commentator turns into Santa everytime a goal goes in
Just don't draw Grimsby. 🙂
This is what the FA cup and football is all about!! I hate the thought of any changes being made - especially by the greedy privileged Premiership clubs! Cracking game 👍
At the game, Wrexham fans were class unfortunate to not get a draw but ggs wrexham
We need deadpool ad with Wrexham 🤣
Respect to both teams neither side gave up 👍🏻
Ryan Reynolds will be pleased
Love how the Welsh team kicked the ball out to end the game
That 2nd Coventry goal gave me chesterfield nightmare flashbacks. Still ON WE GO! YMA O HYD!
‘It’s Always Sunny In Wrexham’
There have been a few giant killings so far and the way Wrexham have been playing i think we might see a few more
Red card for handball Inside the box? Thought double jeopardy was a thing?
What a game that was to watch
Some great work by the Wrexham commercial team on their shirt sponsors. Outplayed Coventry there as well 👏👏👏👏👏
Coventry keeper had a howler, comical at times.
More Wrexham fans than Cov fans wow. Great support
Non league team playing at a higher intensity than most world class teams
Nobody gonna talk about the plumber Cov stuck in goal?
One of the best fa cup games I've seen in years, absolutely amazing 👏.
proper fans, both teams
This game was of a higher standard that any game contested by Premier League teams or Men’s World Cup this season. Wish this entertaining game was televised instead of the borefests we got instead.
The second goal 🥶🥶🥶🥶 but who the hell is that no45 🔥🔥
Wrexham showing that you just need to cross against us and we fold defensively.
The guy with the dreads is a good player
Well played Wrexham. Great game, do the same next match.
Palmer looks quality
🐲🐲🐲🐲
In the FA Cup the bigger teams tend to underestimate the lower teams and always start playing their football too late. Certainly in this years competition
Flipping keeper is shite... haven't we got a better keeper than him. Ffs he needs to go.
What a match would rather watch that  than some premier league matches
National league vs Championship. What a game
Santa Claus doing the commentary was nice.
NO IDEA WHO THE COMMENTATOR IS BUT GIVE THIS MAN SOME BIGGER GAMES GREAT STUFF !!!!!
I bet the Captain will have a few tonight baby
Wrexham are on their way to Win the Champion's League....hehehe
With teams like Wrexham and Chesterfield, non-league football is the strongest it has ever been IMO.
*Goal goes in*  Commentator: OH HA HOOOO!
Love the commentary 😂
Meh - our reserves are non league standard so what do we expect
I'm sure Mr. Reynolds will have had the champagne out tonight, to calm his nerves more than anything. Would definitely be worth a script for his Hollywood boss. LOL
Im not sure why the wall didnt jump on that free kick goal?
what a save from panzo!
I hope wrexham get a same tier side or lower and get hammered lucky bastards
There’s a reason they’re called Wrecks ‘em
Robins out
Wao oh ho!!!
Commentator too excitable.
Despite studying at the university right next door to Wrexham's stadium for four years, I never went to watch one of their matches, seeing them do this to Coventry makes me wish I had actually done so!
What an incredible game, FA Cup classic! Well done Wrexham for a massive win
The future is looking good UTST
I'm a cov fan an we'll done Wrexham you bstuds haha no seriously Wrexham were brilliant in that 1st half an looked like maybe 3,000 Wrexham fans made the journey an that good support away from home from anyone outside of the premiership
What a team Coventry are for coming back from 4-1 down bloody hell
Deadpool laughing in the stand👿
Deadpool will be proud
Well done Wrexham 👏👏👏 Liverpool fan
The amount of chances for Coventry to equalise😂😂that was mental. Was just written for wrexham that’s what you call luck
The game was brilliant, but the commentary..."woo whoo"!
Someone tell this commentator Christmas was two weeks ago OH HO HO
That Coventry keeper 🫣
I like Coventry but well done to Wrexham
I was there
Wow what a game. .
Incredible stuff from Wrexham to hang on the way they did at 4-3. Had everything thrown at them and survived
Gotta love watching the Wrexham journey. As a Shef Wed fan enjoying our own little moment in the sun today.
What a shame that games like this and Chesterfield v West Brom were overlooked by the TV companies. Not even available on the red button. The strength of the National League really showing today. Congrats to Wrexham, Chesterfield and Boreham Wood on getting results against EFL opposition!
Nice to hear the commentator enjoying himself.
cant wait for fingaldinz review
Not a shock
That was better than the World Cup final
We need this commentator more
What a game, sheesh, fair play to Wrexham.
WAA HAA HOO after every goal by the commentator 🤣🤣🤣
Never liked Ryan Reynolds and I hope Deadpool 3 flops 😂  fair play to Wrexham I went the game and the fans were super all game
worst goalkeepers since beardsley went in goal for newcastle v west ham
Now take away the Hollywood millionaires buying the league for the, and it's a different story.  I live near Wrexham and pre Hollywood takeover i always kept a favourable eye on them, but any team using rich owner to pay 10 times what other teams can pay toi win the league don't deserve jack. This goes for man city, Chelsea, Man utd etc, all ruining the game.
Who on earth is that commentator? Accidental Partridge.
I didn't really like the commentary.
never boring with wrexham is it
Fair play to Cov for battling back but big respect to Wrexham!
Lol non league is terrible.
I can never understand why the wrexham wall never jump with free kicks, they did the sane against farnborough with same outcome. Great result though and quality goals. What a win,  up the reds.
Omg Wrexham sponsors are Tik-Tok 😐
Massive turn out from the Wrexham fans wow 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
What a game.
why on earth did gyokeres not pass  to allen when he had that much time and free space?? 😂😂😂
Red card? Really?
The 2nd Wrexham goal had me rewinding for ages, it was incredible, but the commentator: "LEEEeeeeooooooOOOAahhhHHH"
Nobody:   Not a soul:   The BBC commentator: WhOaHoHoAh
That f£#%&£% colour man needs to get sacked right ✅️ f£#%£&% now
Wrexham are gonna win the Fa cup
