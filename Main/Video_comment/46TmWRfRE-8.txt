Person is a fan of fnaf. Person goes to Chuck E. Cheese for irl fnaf just the animatronics are bolted to the floor.
If they were to get a FNAF License, Converting animatronics to FNaF characters would be expensive. Considering they have to remodel buildings, Making new cosmetics, and making new show tapes. Considering most of their animatronic shows are gone they would have to make new ones. That is if the first few locations they turned into FNAF themed locations do succeed. Overall this would be expensive, But it would be cool. Sorry if my interpretation is a bit Unrealistic, if you think it is.
You mean PA-SQO-LY
I think it's because of your sing or die video
I hated when I heard that got removed ya thay would scare me when I saw them but they were cool I saw this video after seeing this a year ago 😂
he sounds, off
3:56 does anyone remember rockstar Freddy and the others anymore?!? 😭😭😭
I had to tell my mom that  FNAF isn’t based on a real story and it’s all fictional and she blamed it on the devil. I had to tell her a time traveling ball pit isn’t in the Bible and she shouldn’t let her 8 year old son play scary games since he gets “easy scared” also kids shouldn’t play video games because when he dies he throws a tantrum and I taken the control manny times
Why this will probably won’t work someone might literally become the real life purple guy 14:23
They should the Duolingo move
Here in 2025? So, I think at some point Scott said he can’t do anything like this and their own restaurant, because of people trying re create the lore from the game is isn’t the best so we will never get a real fnaf location :( or that’s least what I’m pretty sure it is but idk
Insane Fnaf dickriding
dang and they even sayed "our favorite purple guy in 13:49
My suggested page is crazy for recommending this after a Chuck-E got arrested in my hometown yesterday 😭
If building and maintaining animatronics is becoming too expensive for Disney, then surely the idea doesn’t bode well for any FNAF adaptation by Chuck E. Cheese.
What's funny is that now Chuck E. Cheese is making adult locations
Candy's reference let's gooooooooo
If they leaned into the FNAF theme with official partnership they would make a huge come back, the audience is clearly there and they know it but are afraid of tarnishing their family friendly image.
I feel bad for the big c even though I’m scared of it
If it wasnt for fnaf, i would never know about cec.
They lying they’re crushing kids dreams they should bring the animatronics back this dance floor is trash I miss the old Chuck E. Cheese animatronic.
i just told pocketpair about this theory
No. Gave em publicity and they BOMBED
Yeah, I like the old animatronics and they don’t need to be maintained much.
It's ironic that adults, yes adults rather than children would rather go to a place like Freddy Fazbears as a form of entertainment. Place an Arcade, A bar, and some older Showbiz animatronics and you have yourself a profitable business.
what is huggy doing here? 6:36
No I don't think destroyed chuck-e-cheese it's probably because it was just too expensive to keep the animatronics running you know timely keep them updated and constantly keeping them repaired and are kids even interested in seeing these types of things to me the more interested in their phones in iPads then Arsenal seeing moving objects such as these but my question is can you actually in a right with the animatronics or you could just watch them from a far
They need to make an official fnaf pizzaria in all states and citys for other fnaf fans to be happy and not have to go to a different state to go to fnaf pizzaria cuz it could be right there
Way late to this but my local Chuck E Cheese closed down a long while ago. And long before that, they moved away from their animatronics and, just like mentioned by mat, opened up a dance floor for the kids to dance with Chuck E. and even sing happy birthday at times. Honestly it might've been a better business model to have people in costumes rather than robots. I remember kids would try to climb on stage to hug or high five those things, definitely safe to do that to a guy in a Chuck suit
its such a waste to get rid of the animatronics, i read a comment saying that the instructions were to rip them up just like they did in the 80s with the rockafires
Anyone here in 2025 🎉 miss Matt Patt 😢
I would 110% go to a fnaf/chuck e cheese establishment. I hope the chuck e cheese CEOs seen this
ummmm its bite of 83 not 87
The fnaf animatronics are way less creepy than the Chuck E. Cheese animatronics
Always felt FNAF was more inspired by Showbiz Pizza.
Aw he’ll no he really dissed Benihana?! Come to Milo’s Angeles, it’s better here
I feel like everyone grew up
Rockstar Chuck e a rockstar Freddy fazber
I only went to Chuck E Cheese for a birthday because of FNAF. Now, at 23 (almost 24), having gone to Chuck E Cheese for ALOT of birthdays, and probably more to come, I hate that there's no animatronics.
so youre saying they should do their own fazbear frights!
Scott Cawthon has gone on record to say that Freddy and the gang will never be real because some sicko might try to recreate the events of the games. He has a valid reason but I genuinely think those sort of risks could be mitigated with door locks, room access and competent security measures. Other than those things, there is LITERALLY NOTHING stopping Scott from having a real life Freddy's.
I feel like Fnaf and Chuck should collab
I think it was more because they didnt like restoring animatronics and when they broke it was just too much money to give for fixing it
They got rid of alcohol around me a few years ago because parents were getting drunk and fighting over their kids.
i honestly dont blame whoever made the decision to remove them, i wouldve done the same. from my experience with young family members FNAF is most popular among young kids 4-10 that most havent even played the games but will watch videos on it all day before the can even recite their times tables. We all know kids are also not the best at seperating fact from fiction which i could imagine would most likely significantly effect a real life buisness with a similar concept's image and profits.
I don't know what it feels like to be at a chuck E cheese but I do know that they didn't want to get rid of the animatronics it's ok

Nightmare rat is in the shadows  i can see his red beady shiny eyes
Wait, what happened  to Jasper, the dog one.
You in your 30 I thought you was 20 or 22
The original dance floors were really nice and ripped right out of the '80s The ones that are actually at the stores we're not from the '80s they were ripped from tamu
I don't  think  that is the case one time me and my friends  were  there  for  a birthday  party  and the manager  of the place  came my friend asked him does  he know about  fnaf the manger  said yes in fact he was a big fan of the game
2030: glamrock chuck e
As much as kids love fnaf you would think they’d want to capitalize on that and keep the animatronics
I liked teen chuck E. The best it just feels weird they way they made it more realistic instead of did cartoon
NOOOO DONT LEAVE US WITHOUT ANIMATRONICS 😢😢😢
Hard rock cafe is a real restaurant?? I thought it was a tshirt brand or something?
Also Charles entertainment cheese doesn't allow an adult to enter without a child present, so they're kinda loosing money from that because some adults just want to feel the nostalgia of going to CC as they did when they were a child
1:39 no Jasper?
I cant believe he referenced to glamrock freddy instead of rockstar freddy when he talked rockstar chuck
I really wish there were places for kids and teens to hang out with eachother, we're constantly indoors and there's nowhere to go especially since we're so car dependent and can't walk anywhere either, it's no wonder this generation is so lonely myself included.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
They should make a "chuck e's frights"
The main reason can be boiled down to them still recovering from the bankruptcy they faced in 2020 from the recycled pizza allegations and covid. This made the animatronics too expensive to maintain. And it's not like they had any of Billy Bob left for spare parts because the majority of the time, he was stolen.
1. Whooo! Showbiz! Kc pride! 2. Chuck pivoting to horror with FNaF is really smart. I honestly think a FNaF themed pizzia place would get great business, I wish Scott was more open to the idea.
chuck e cheese has been wanting to take away the animatronics since 2015 just so you know ALSO they have had beer and wine since the start so yeah, do more research next time.
Loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooore
FNAC MENTIONED 😮😮😮😮⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️
Love how he corrects himself from saying glamrock, and says rockstar, and also forgets the rockstar animatronics
They should just give the animatronics a makeover to look way less creepy. There’s a lot of animatronics out there that look just fine, not creepy at all. Those are creepy af, even before the movie came out. I think they just need a good makeover
No no no I love chuck e cheeese
You would think the success of the Five Nights at Freddy’s movie with all that giant stuff would make the animatronics in Chuck E. Cheese more popular therefore Chuck E. Cheese should keep them
I love the idea of a fnaf themed pizzeria irl just don’t try to incorporate ai
Why did you make Glamrock Freddy come when it was rockstar Chucky and not rockstar freddy
They could make hi-tech animatironics like Disney's animatironics
Chuck e cheese pizza is massively underrated
I don’t understand why they don’t just update the look of the animatronics
01001110 01101111 01110100 01101000 01101001 01101110 01100111 00100000 01101001 01110011 00100000 01100001 01110011 00100000 01101001 01110100 00100000 01110011 01100101 01100101 01101101 01110011 11100010 10000000 10100110
Eatertainment is also going out of business because we keep getting squeezed out of having any disposable income by high rent, low minimum wage, and people advocating to *keep* those things that way.
I think Pascali killed Chuck e
Ngl, bc of FNAF, I'm now into animal animatronics, which got me into fnaf, showbiz, circus jamboree, etc., its why I've heavily considered going back them just to see the animatronic shows, I even considered (and applied) to work there as my first time job but am now SUPPER upset they the one near me doesn't have them anymore! While leaning into the horror aspect might be more appealing to teens, there are little kids who are fans of fnaf who I'm sure would love that.
At this point they should just convert the animatronics into the fnaf ones
At this point, I dont understand why anyone is worried about scaring kids away. The number of kids I see all the time carrying Poppy Playtime toys or watching shows made for a much older demographic is ridiculous. Kids aren't mentally pure and innocent these days. These companies need to grow a backbone.😂
My local Chuck E. Cheese never had an animatronics
You forgot jasper the dog when saying all the animatronics
It’s spring trap that killed Chuck E. Cheese
7:01 DSAF 2 PRIZE CORNER
If a Freddy's pizza chain popper up I'd try out some pizza
15:44 I don’t know what he means
the fact that Chuckie Cheese and FNAF are so similer is hilarious
Matpat can u explain me this One time,I decided to try some merchandise from my favorite YouTubers  So when I ordered some theorywear merch they said that I will get it in two weeks I waited for two weeks that turned into months which later turned into two years  I WANT MY MONEY BACK NOW
Honestly, looking back at the FNAF 1 characters and comparing them to the Chuck-E-Cheese characters. The FNAF characters are actually much more appealing and cute than the Chuck-E-Cheese ones ever were. Which is hilariously ironic.
HE SAID THE THING
Chuck E Cheese literally has an entire infrastructure in place. Just license the FNAF brand and make Freddy Fazbears Pizza a reality
Chuck E. Cheese rebelling against self in the war community, helping it out
All I know is that there is no reason I would go to Chuck E Cheese’s now that the animatronics are gone. 😢
You would get your kid a video game so they will sit and ignore you? Sure those places might be gross at least you make memories with your kids, nothing lasts forever after all
I❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤U
UWU
I just went to Chuck e Cheese a week ago with Chuck, but he wasn't dancing. (I'm 18)
okay, the chucky cheese employee card is hilarious. wish I had read it the first time.
I remember the E standing for "eats". Chuck eats cheese.
OMG MATPAT
Modernity killed Chuck’E’ and his friends!
so what you're suggesting is,,,     Fazbear Frights from fnaf 3? Because youve prettyy much described word for word,,,     Fazbear Frights   from fnaf 3
as usual choosing to focus on something is better than trying to do everything mediocrely
CEC is keeping a couple locations with animatronics as “Legacy Locations” so they’re not truly gone 😭🤗
glamrock chucky✅ rockstar chuky❌
3:58 rockstar chuck e was made in 2010 nearly a decade before security breach  why are you making it seem like chuck e cheese ripped fnaf off
Fnof✨✨✨✨✨
I don’t think they should make Fnaf a real pizzeria in real life granted I love Fnaf with all my heart I just don’t want a psychopath pretending to be purple guy for there twisted mind.
1:42  jasper seeing this part:🤨
e
Five nights of  fun
2024? 👇
Feels good to hear your voice
FNAF a ruined the idea of “eatertainment”
Mat pat you said this will be easier to understand then Fnaf lore but it’s feels almost the same
If FNAF actually made a resturant chain they probably could put chuck e cheese out of bussiness. It also would probbly would boost their sales considerable. People like urban legends come to life. People travel all over the world to see real spooky things.
4:01 The rockstar animatronics would like to have a word
wait this is a food theory 😭
I love MatPat but this is a prime example of how he ruins childhoods. I loved Chuck E. Cheese! Still an interesting video though 😅
Not all locations are removing the animatronics because it was announced by CEC that they would have 5 locations as legacy stores meaning that they would receive the 2.0 remodel but also keep Munches Make Believe Band hence the name “Legacy Locations” or “Retro Location” or “Hybrid Location” so  technically FNAF didn’t completely eliminate the future of the Chuck E Cheese animatronics
1:39 Where is Jasper????
And now it’s a Just a normal boring restaurant
Make a plush
Ur right matpat. Fnaf sued chuck e cheese
Ms Hippo is for adults hmmmmmmmmmm who else?
I actually would love if Chucky cheese made a horror attraction
What was that rat at the end
Jasper
Charles Edwin Cheese. He's a distinguished gentleman now. 🧐
3:51 CHUCKE THERE ARE CHILDREN AROUND
Call me insane but the only reason I would go to Chuck E. Cheese is for the pizza no kidding…….
As a FNAF fan I AM going go Chuck E cheese for my birthday I just hope my location still has the anamatronics😎😎😎❤💀❤
I have had nightmares of that as a kid, but now I'M F*CKING HYPED FOR THE SECOND FNAF MOVIE!

I was the biggest fan of Chuck E. Cheese, and just to see how much has changed saddens me.
The food at Benihana’s is top tier in my opinion.
ik matt no longer is part of food theory but... if i had a laser cutter, i will make the fnaf animatronics real
Keep the t rex universal
They said they'd get rid of them 6 years ago🤦‍♀️they're staying🤦‍♀️
what sucks about this is i recentlt went to a chuck e cheese and well...the animatronics were gone they had tv screen instead
You guys know five nights at chuck e cheese's exists right?!
Main event foreshadowed fnaf ruin guys
I watched the movie and I was 7 years old
Honestly, the animatronics would be the only reason to go to Chuck E. Cheese. For the soul reason because I’m a fnaf fan.
On the decline? In this economy?! I'm not surprised lol
And like specifically this video is a waste of time and waste of a good video why does this
And like I say that FNAF would always be the bad dark none fun rip off brother or sister to Chuck E cheese and it will always be that FNAF what is and always is based off of Chuck E cheese
In considering how people like mostly like FNAF because the animatronics in The Afton family or the Henry family or anything like like if the game didn't have any of those things like if there was one game that didn't have any of those things in it in a FNAF game nobody would would love it at all because that's basically the whole plot of everybody wants to die and come back to possess a animatronic that's like what everyone wishes and wants
Maybe they should’ve contacted Scott see if he wanted to make some real animatronic casings and collard with the movie, would’ve made money
Best thoey ever :) i love it im sad that matpat quit :( but whatever i don't care it is
Disney land is the rockstars, Chuck E. Cheese is mediocre melodies.
Bro I used to watch them as a kid 1:53  its so sas
Fun fact about me: I once, as a around 8 - 9 year child, got access to wattpad, I had just found a fnaf summoning thing, did it in a chuck E Cheese bathroom, light flickered once (Faulty lighting), and I got so creeped out and I was conviced that I had summoned Freddy effing Fazbear, and have never gone back. (I am a teenager now folks, that has lasted with me) Fnaf, ruined Chucky Entertainment Cheese for me. (I also had nightmares about fnaf characters chasing me down a chuck e cheese hallway)
And they are trying to destroy all the animatronics even tho they would make a killing selling them to collecters
That’s what I’m saying irl fnaf bru
I still remember The Rock-a-fire Explosion doing a rendish of 'Rubber Biscuit' back in the '80s daze when ShowBiz reigned supreme. 6:41 Captain Commando. That takes me back. 13:00 24 in 2024 counts as Gen-Z. 14:30 Imagine an Evil Dead-themed restaurant! Or how about one based on 'Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark' (the original books)?!
Didn't he quit
No..Carrot Topp from the Radioactive Chicken Heads did😂

I as soon as it said "what killed of chuck-e-cheese?" I got an add that said "the federal government" 😂😂😂
7:01 dsaf reference?! (Joke)
The fact he basically just explained the beginning of the fnaf timeline💀 William being chuckys restaurant. And Henry being the other restaurant. Then they merge to make a better one. Slow clap
Companies should pay you for this
5:49 hold up that lazer tag looks like the one in security breach...
13:27 Can confirm, 2/3rds of the birthdays I had at Chuck E Cheese in my life were solely because of FNAF. (Although one of those I spent the entire time up in the play structures watching the animatronics like a hawk in case they moved off-stage lol)
I know how to make money, scrap chuckee and make a skibidi toilet animatronic
I ain’t trying to start a war but he said cheaper and a picture of Disney showed up
I would LOVE that!!!
The fact that I am just discovering this video is insane 😭💀
It's honestly scary how much of the fnaf lore is taken from the history of Chuck E Cheese. the smart man with a dream, the rival companies combining, the 5 dead people, etc
14:31 I am so confused rn. My brain is asleep. What TV SHOW or movie is that clip from??!! Ever since I saw that clip, I've been pondering my head off! I've been wanting to watch that.
0:20 You DARE not call them Fortnite dance floors?
There's Been many other Killer Animatronic Movies that added up to Chuck E Cheese's Removal of their Animatronics, like Willy's Wonderland, Pandory's pan pizza palace from Hulu, The Banana Splits Movie, and Yes Freddy Fazbear from not only the Movie Five Nights at Freddy's but also the Five Nights at Freddy's Video Game.
Also, why does no one remember five kids went missing at chuck e cheese and were never found while the animatronics were still there? Not only that but one staff member was killed too.
My son realised that you were in the movie
Chuck E. Cheese announced they would remove animatronics in 2019
10:36 MrBeast:It might seem crazy what I’m about to say
The rockstar chuck and matpat saying glamrock was funny But bro there’s a rockstar band
Maybe the animatronics are being sent to the underground bunker mentioned in a previous Food Theory 😮
A horror themed rat or mouse, you say? That shouldn't be hard to do or imagine  One word: Skaven
As far as horror goes; my newest Binge is Insidious. The alternate dimension of the films - creating a world of darkness, not unlike a city or town, at night, when it's so dark, you can't see anything in front of you - except for the street lights  This all reminds me of that dark dimension, intended for The Dead & not The Living, along with the uncertainty of what's out there; in all that darkness? How big, is this alternate reality? Does it completely mirror the World of The Living?  Abandoned places - a classic, in my opinion. Hospitals, schools, prisons, parks, towns, all abandoned; all full of intrigue  Another horror I'm digging, is space horror, like Dead Space, DOOM 3, Warhammer 40k, Alien Isolation, & Stasis - an indy horror game that caught my eye  Space horror is the ultimate solution to the haunting house: Where do go? How do you leave? It's in Space. Couple that with horror elements like darkness & shadows, sounds, etc - & we have something to work with
FNAF  A franchise that's covered by every Theory Channel
Honestly; I'm surprised a FNAF Movie was made at all  There's hope yet
There should be a Freddy's restaurant but just in case someone called William trys to do "SOMETHING" you get scanned for weapons when you come in (even the manager)
Rockstar freddy and friends:rockstar chuck e chesse,eh? But we are keep elvolving
This video will lead to another real life Freddy's location.
So Uhm FNAC is Kinda under the Fnaf Roof so Chuck E Chesse Might not
finally i'm happy
We need a new animatronic place now that it's not Chuck E. Cheese anymore
Congratulations. Your video was chosen to be watched while I eat pizza
I was so excited to see you in the movie my family was not amused lol
if Eat-etainment is dying, then Medieval Times is next... starting with Food Theory video
It should’ve been the pizza
Wait...... Top golf is a restaurant? I thought it was like a driving range type place......
I had LITTERALLY never hear of "rainforest cafe" till that one dude went to all of them and made that video.
And this is why I hate Fnaf :D ps SEND FRED TO JAIL
they should make chuck e a vocaloid miku style
I would love to see a Freddy bear or bonnie on chuck e cheese's stage
As me watching this right now I’m wearing my hibernation sweater 💯
imagine how many people would go to Chuck E. Cheese if they did a fnaf partnership, i would. they could even do it just during october after certain hours like universal’s halloween horror nights
how is chuck. e cheese in food theorey
how is chuck.e cheese in food theory
TED NIVISON MENTIONED YAHOO !
i know a place nearby me that was given chile animatronics and they just sit and dance at the location it’s quite cool
14:40 i think mat just wants fnaf irl /j
13:52 this is so funny to me
i think the digitalization of everything is quite sad honestly
I'm gonna miss MatPat when he leaves
Me and my partner are working on making real animatronics and some day YOU'LL SEE me and my partner will get the goahead from Scott and you will be able to go a real Freddy Fazbear's pizza in nova scotia canada.
How is this food theory?!
4:53  no joke i’m a full grown adults and i occasionally go to chuck e cheese EXCLUSIVELY for the pizza, and as a kid the only thing I really cared for in a chuck e cheese was the pizza, it’s just that good.
Hey matpat so i went to the chuck e. Cheese chanel and i went to comment but it was off? You should make a theory about "why is chuck e. Cheese commets off?"
Hey matpat
8:25 William Afton Reference
It's Funny More Kids Know Freddy Fazbear Than Chuck E Cheese, Truly Comical.
15:45 is that who I think it is?
Chuck E. Cheese is gonna die...
Chuck e cheese animatronics haven’t been up running for like ten years this was a long time coming
Rockstar Freddy
That would be great if Scott and CEC would work together to save Chuck E Cheese from bankruptcy and to make a real life Freddy Fazbear's!
I’m now wondering how much of the fnaf lore is canon Chuck E. Cheese lore
I mean idk someone actually said that they went to a Chuck E. Cheese and they said that the chuck e robot winked and move and then Trun back to its power off pose and it was creepy and it’s true
the animatronics were the only thing that interested me :(  eu até comeria aquela pizza paia deles por isso
we need a chuckee cheese fnac partnership
No not David Buster I might not be a kid, but it’s one of my favorite arcades.
3:41 I miss showbiz.
So 32 springlocks
Freddy fartbear
Actually, rather recently in a Chuck-E-Cheese, albeit not recent enough, I actually saw that there was still that one modern animatronic of the man himself there. None of the others. Just him. The others WERE present, they just weren’t on a stage. They were on a screen. Not as animatronics, but as animations.
Kids that went to Chuck E. Cheese were scared of the animatronic because five night of Freddy’s made their movie
Imagine is Scott Cawthon bought out Chuck E Cheese and revamped it as a FNAF restaurant.
They should be thanking fnaf  for people going to their restaurants and for getting interested in animatronics, that’s a big reason why I still like Chuck E. Cheese
Before the movie came  in theaters cec was doing five nights of fun during October and blocking people on twitter who mentioned fnaf
Theyre replacing them with the toys lol💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
This is why I may never go to Chuck E Cheese's
Novelty restaurants are actually pretty normal and popular in japan, they'll make a returaunt over any little thing that gets popular
Chuck e’s frights
My daughter absolutely loves Helen Henny and we drove for hours to the nearest Chuck’s that still had the band so she could see them. But then again, she may never have heard of it if her older brother didn’t play fnaf.
Someone should @ Charles' Bosses about this video, its some solid advice.
My younger friend who's 12 (few years younger) went to see the FNaF movie with me
I'm always trying to go there for the pizza it's the best pizza I'd ever have and everyone else disagrees with me1
that fnof foster looks sus
Don't blame fnaf
I agree lots of people would buy a freddy mask then a chuck mask
Here is the thing people are going to start recreating fnaf with the murders because if idiots
Would be pretty cool if they did something sort like you did a while back with Game Lab, where you guys had a challenge room to try to see if you actually could survive Five Nights at Freddy's. Fun little horror room with you in there with the buttons and stuff. I doubt that would ever happen but I think something like that would be really well received if they did.
It’s funny how he keep saying “say I’m a parent” even though he is a parent
4:01 The funny thing about this is that "Rockstar" is also a type of animatronic in FNAF
What about Fish Game Arcades.
if i ever can, i will add a pizzeria-type place with animatronics (prob like the fredbear and spring bonnie, bolted to the ground) there’s no way i can live without it
13:36 I cannot get over "special appearance by everyone's favorite purple guy". 🤣 That kills me and I would absolutely assume this was a parody if I saw this poster out of context.
1:43 Rex would be happy that it's close to them northridge girls
RIP Matpat 😢
Idea. One night, entirely random, when kids and familys are all gathered in the dining area, the band sits on stage, seemingly deactivated. Then Chucky turns and looks right at the nearest table with no noise, fanfare, music, or anything. It just stares at the table. If the table notices and gets a little freaked out, Chucky will very slowly inch closer and closer towards the table. As they freak out, the lights turn off and you hear some classic FNAF sounds all around the room. Suddenly, lights turn back on and none of the animatronics are on stage. You can now hear the ambience music from the FNAF games  and there's a foxy peaking out of random parts of the restaurant at random tables. It never makes a noise; there's no jump scare sounds. You just see it peak, stare for a few seconds, then hide again. All while the distorted FNAF sounds keep the tension high.  Then Baby rolls out into the dining room with icecream and...
0:52 THE CUPCAKE
Listen, I will straight up create/found an entertainment restaurant that is like sunshine and rainbows/happiness there has been so much horror in my life I’m tired of seing horror things 😅 I honestly hope Chuck E. Cheese does not bring back these animatronics and make them scary cause yeah technically I’m in their target demographic/age range but at least let me go once without it being scary. “I’m just too soft for all of it”  Give me whimsy, give me calm, give me friendly mythological creatures, give me unadulterated joy. I will say that I did love this theory, and as I’ve stated before in past comments I will miss you MatPat, you brought joy into my life 😊❤
Matpat straight up suggesting Chuck E. Cheese fazbear frights itself.
I always thought it was a shame that rides nowadays don't have a lot of animatronics like they used to. I get that they're hard to maintain, but it still feels different from being spooked by a large mechanical dinosaur versus spooked by a large hologram version of one.
The funny thing is I had birthday at chuck e cheeses and someone was injured by chuck E. And friends. No they didn't get their frontal lobe bitten off😂 but the kid was dared by my sister and his friends to climb the wall that had the animatronics closed off from the guest and he touched chuck E.'s face and fell into the the stage and got electrocuted bad. I got yelled at by staff for trying to climb the wall and had to tell the staff that a boy was in there and was badly hurt. He quickly turned the animatronics off and he climbed in there and grabbed the kid and climbed the wall to get down while the staff member has to grab the boy from them. Needless to say they stayed shut down all day and we were all told to leave as the boy went to the hospital. The kid was okay and returned home 2 days later and was back at school Monday. I knew the kid he was a year older than me and was in the same class at me hence why I tried to climb the wall and stop him. No he was not their for my birthday infact he avoided me the whole day until the incident where I saw him climbing and saw the sparks showing he got hurt. 😢
5:48 lol XD
Who is re watching after the goodbye internet video was up
Chuck E. Cheese is becoming Daffy Duck, becoming popular not by FNAF but out of spite toward FNAF.
Yo can I have your channle
poppy playtime would also work, the aesthetic of Chuck fits really well with the aesthetic of Poppy.
Let’s be honest, Pasqelli got rid of em’         But hey that’s just a Theory….
We are going to miss you matpat
I went to my first Chuck E Cheese birthday party since I was a kid because my nephew LOVES FNAF. They need to lean into the connection more.
Growing up and since I’m still in a part of my childhood, my Chuck E Cheese never ever had animatronics and so when I first started watching these I was like, “wait, animatronics! WHAT?”
Well looks like it’s finally time for fnaf to make their own restaurant
So you're saying... cheese's frights? A horror attraction based on the family friendly animatronic pizzeria that was suffering financially?
I just noticed that their outro music is on a similar level to kahoot music, I think it would be very difficult to find someone who dislikes either of them.
Tbh when I was younger I used to love the animatronics -before and after fnaf- and I remember going to a Chuck E. Cheese for my little cousins bday and loving the animatronics and making jokes with my older cousin about fnaf
Wow cool
Yes, recreate fnaf. WHY NOT?
There is still rockstar Freddy??
How does fnf find its way through all of the channels.
Wait. that sounds like the story of Henry Emily and William Afton........right?
I hope animatronics stick around
This “horror experience” thing could work for Chuck E. Cheese, if they get permission to use Disney’s “Free Roaming Audio-Animatronics” technology.
In fnaf there is rock stars
There's already rock stars
Dude I'm 11 I went to Chucky cheese for my 4th birthday. I wanted to go there again 😢
*Chuck E Cheese animatronic in the back of the restaurant* please insert five coins, please insert five coins, Chuck E doesn't like this, thank you for inserting five coins
i will nnnnot be rrplast
hear me out tho, what if they just lean real hard into this and do a limited time colab in like 1-2 locations were they have freddy and friends as the animatrotics they could do it on Halloween throw some fnaf style food up like idk Chika's buffalo chicken wings or like Monty's cheesy garlic bread bites, they do that sort of thing in cafes in japan all the time
What song do you use at 2:37?
Sticking my head above the parapet to say I really did love their pizza as a kid 35-40 years ago. (The robots not so much.)
Idk which benihana hurt you but it does not deserve to be slandered this hard 😂😂
14:14 “ToO ScArY” literally my mom when i talk about fnaf or just barely mention it in front of her and im a teenager
Hey can you be Allergic to water?
I can see chuck e cheese doing well if they started doing partnerships with popular things like fnaf. Even if it ends up being temporary, they could change it up every once in a while to keep things interesting, since new ideas could come into play.
14:58 I hate that he put original Foxy, rockstar Bonnie, original Freddy, and toy Chica instead of just putting the same version of each animatronic
The Chuck E. Cheese by me got rid or the animatronics years ago then got one big one which was removed a 10 years later during covid before the fnaf movie was even out
At my local Chuck E. Cheese they been removed them for a long time now
13:07 UNLESS THERE ME IM UNDER 13
Admittedly, before I've finished this video, while the sound of a bar arcade sounds nice as an adults, I'm kind of upset due to the fact kids and teens seem like they're getting less and less places to hang out
Chuck E. Cheese is fanf think about it fnaf 5 kinds went missing Chuck E. Cheese again 5 kids went missing, fnaf animatronics Chuck E. Cheese animatronics
More people today know the name Freddy Fazbear than Chuck E Cheese
Your garage               Hate you                      Monkey
I feel like FNAF made animatronics more interesting as a concept for some people and it would have probably been a better idea to keep some animatronics around in order for fans of the games to see how the real deal works. (just my personal preference, it's totally fine if FNAF just made animatronics 100% more creepier for you)
The gag on the "rockstar" to glamrock was funny but there are already rockstar animotronics that are simular to lefty
loving that the chuck e cheese timeline is so similar to your fnaf early timeline.   Guy who loves entertaining Rival Briskness' Rises (with better animatronics) They Merge They go bankrupt AND we have the rockstar animatronics from FNAF 6
Food theory: chuck e cheese Game theory: Fnaf Film theory: fnaf movie
The full name is absolutely foul.
This basically means eventually the animatronics will get advanced enough to roam freely and start killing kids (if some afton becomes one of the higher ups and goes insane). And why? Because us, dumb, naïve, humans wanted to bring an imaginary horror franchise to life.
They (CEC) were looking for a full out from maintaining those animatronics... FNAF just gave them the best excuse.
Not gonna lie, if CC made a FNAF restaurant, I'd go. I'm a grown man with no kids and I'd go.
As a rainforest cafe fan I can attest this "fact" the rainforest cafe is and always will be my favorite place
Fnaf6 Chuck E. Cheese
9:05 I love when Game Theory made the loudest subtle pride outfit unknowingly
i go for the pizza
What also doesn't help the downfall of CEC is how they've barely updated their animatronic bands. Many locations, from what I understand are still using the big and bulky tech from the 80's and 90s. What they should've done the entire time is be there alongside Disney, experimenting on more interactive characters rather than the janky stationary ones we're left with. Pneumatic parts are definitely expensive but if they updated to the electronic servos we have now, that at the very would manage costs a bit. Imagine dancing with Helen on those new dance floors or getting singing listens from the big rat himself, now that's an experience I'd happily go and pay for. One thing Security Breach did amazingly, was how lifelike and interactive it got the characters.
The sound in the back bro 2:40
when i went to Disney this past spring, i was on the avatar River ride and we passed the huge na’vi animatronic. a week later when we got home, my sister’s friend was at Disney and on that ride. But instead of the animatronic being there, it was a hologram because the animatronic broke and it was too expensive to fix in that small period of time.
MATPAT WAS IN THE FNAF MOVIE!!!!!!!!
Dude really fnaf killed chuck e are you kidding me fnaf is also fake and stop saying fnaf ok
Kids love spooky stuff, but unfortunately many parents would never allow their kids to go to a horror themed pizza place lol it would be so cool tho
no, they ruined themselves.
As someone without kids and my friend group is also childless, why would we want to go to a place with screaming children and parents who don't watch them? I can barely stand shopping with Karens who cannot/will not parent while her 3 kids scream and cry for things. I get being a parent can be hard but like..something has to give My audio sensory overload sends me into a panic attack.
hey you coond open your self a fnaf pizzeria you would just get the license to fnaf
More kids know FNAF then Chuck E Cheese 💀
I still can't figure out why there are no real FNAF Restaurants with FNAF Animatronics. Like they would make SO much money. I would love to go there!
All hail Scott Cawthon killer of Charles Entertainment Cheese, Ruler of FNaF world.
honeslty, im not the biggest fan of fully screen on ride experiences, I do like the mix of it with actual animatronics like for example Rise of the Resistance. I do think that if parks go more digital like for example, Universal Studios with the Simpsons ride, it was just a screen and when I got off, I had a massive headache. Ive noticed that some people cant handle those display kind of rides because it hurts their eyes so its possible they can lose guests like that
nah chuck e. cheese was already dying lol
how to save Chuck E Cheese: make fnaf real
Bro Chuck E Cheese died long before FNAF came out.
I guess my husband and I are unique XD Not only do we basically do all our dates at Dave n Buster's... We had our wedding reception there haha! I think we helped our local DnB thanks to that XD But I understand the mentality. We just don't drink, are kids at heart, love ticket prizes and games, and don't mind (tooooooo much) the screaming children. We're actually pretty good at getting jackpots and know when a game is ready or not and let the kids rack up the tickets every time they lose so it gets the game ready for a real win hahaha
You should try making pizza from the fnaf cook book !!
wait, this is a whole _genre_ now? juck-e-jeesus, i'm really out of touch 👀
I’ve had probably like a 3rd of all my birthdays at Chuck E. Cheese. It makes me sad that they’re trying to get rid of the animatronics.
I Got A Great Idea About This On How To Handel This The Fnaf Band Goes In One Room With There Video Games While Munch’s Make Believe Band Could Be In A Another Room That Has Retro Arcade Games Then The Main Room Could Stay Normal
Kills a mouse
Mickey mouse
Looks like the student became the teacher LOL
5:30 i have literally never heard of any of these in my life, and im 25 😂
He Is Useing Chuck E Cheese As A Avenge So He Could Keep Talking About Fnaf
This Has Gone OverboardAt This Point
Chuck E Cheese stared at me wherever I went and it creeped me out once💀
As A Chuck E Cheese Fan Myself I Do NOT Want The Animatronics Being Retrofitted To The Fnaf Gang I Understand The Fnaf In A DIFFERENT Room But Not Replacing The Big C
Did you know: chuck e cheese didnt actually start 2.0 AFTER the fnaf movie, it was being executed for about a year or two before its release. The only reason its more public news now is because people are finally going to Their local chuck e cheeses and seeing the aftermath.
I bet chucki was like: uh.. h- hey pal! Wh- why are you here so late?.. hello ….   There can only be one. Noooooo! Bleh.
Thwy ahould make a chuck e cheese horrir movie
wait your in ur 30s? :/ i thought you were in your 20s or somthing
my mom said the reason they are getting rid of the anmictorics is because they are scareing kids.
I use to lived near that chuck e cheese
Came for food theory, got company man lol
Personally FNAF never really made me scared of the Chuck E. Cheese animatronics because I was always scared of them in the first place. 😎
Please deposit five coins
Food theory idea :make a video about MrBeast Grocery Store video and if it was possible to live there longer
I applied to work at Chuck E Cheese BECAUSE i love fnaf. I thought itd be cool to see the animatronics close up at night. I also had other reasons but fnaf was huge. Worked there for a year then moved cities. Good times.
*started writing this before finishing the video so MatPat covers most of what I said* I mean maintaining animatronics has to be expensive and if something breaks down I doubt that you can always just run down to Home Depot to get a part. Also with the mascot evolving to be more cartoonish, the animatronics are no longer representative. It would make more sense to scrap the animatronics and move to screens (easily replaced) and maybe more AR/digitally interactive elements if you are going to keep the concept.  Also as many comments have already mention they are probably getting sick of everyone asking them about FNAF. They can probably make a pretty penny selling the animatronics to a FNAF or FNAF adjacent escape rooms or something. Or some branches lean into a Pizzaplex setup cuz lets face it we all wanted to experience the Pizzaplex. Have it be the arcade/eatery with elements of "something isn't quite right about this place" maybe have a section that is an escape room experience. Be a little tongue and cheek about it. IDK im just spit balling.
Since a lot of people are talking about that, that Scott would never make a real restaurant because someone might try to recreate the events of FNAF, is there a source for that? I never remember Scott mentioning anything about it.
Yeah Chuck E Cheese needs to just accept that they’re CREEPY. I would go visit again if they started making it a horror experience to be there!! Chuck E Cheese is not for kids in this new generation they have games n electronics so why are they still trying to reel these new kids in?!🤣 WE (the “new adults” who used to play at Chuck E. Cheese when we were little) would love to see the franchise evolve and grow with its audience/customers.
my dad comes to dave and busters as a celebration like if we get perfect scores and he is pretttty happy we we go there
Charles entertainment cheese pizza is amazing! ❤
It’s like Duolingo Those ads are unhinged
Growing up in a suburban area as they started phasing them out, they never repaired the ones at ours, and I thought the stage thing was just a huge decoration!  I also have a very vague memory of getting scared when I saw one move FOR THE FIRST TIME.
i heard scott does not want to create a irl fnaf because he is afraid of someone trying to recreate the story...idk if that is true or not, so if cec tried to collab and build real fnaf animatronics, it would never happen.
I am nine Andi saw the fnaf movie
I always found it weird that Chuck E. Cheese never took advantage of the FNAF hype. It would have been free money.
It’s ironic how Matpat uses an image of a “bad pizza” *cough cough* a pizza that doesn’t line up evenly, but literally a few years ago, he supported the pizza with an opposite opinion @ 7:24
I actually heard that it was a comment on one of Scot's old Games that inspired fnaf
YOUR THE BEST YOUTUBER!!!!!!!!!!! YAAAA IM 11!!!
Completely right about the pizza thing. Why go to Chuck E Cheese when I can get a Little Caesars pizza delivered to my doorstep?
15:43 WHO'S THAT IN THE BOTTOM LEFT CORNER????
🔥🔥🔥😱🔥😱🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😱🔥🔥😱🔥🔥😱😱🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😱🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥WHAT IS ThiS MUSIC 3:05 🔥🔥🔥😱🔥🔥🔥😱🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😱😱🔥🔥🔥🔥
That was crazy how charles was holding a cigarette
15:38-15:45 five nights at Candy's (FNAC) anyone?
Has something to boost up m&s what about
MatPat kinda right
Imagine the amount of money CEC could make by partnering with Scott Cawthon and Jim Henson's Creature Workshop by making a real and functional Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria. Imagine how it will glorify the Nightguard Job
LOL? 9:48
Does no one remember that there was actual people murdered in a Chuck E. Cheese because a dude got fired and got mad so he came back and killed the closing crew?
a combination of everything becomming super expensive and people's salaries being stagnant not increasing with the inflation and rent being stupidly expensive it makes sense not many people go out to eat
I’m 25, and I HATE horror and being scared. Always have. It’s the main reason I REFUSE to play ANYTHING FNAF
I remember Showbiz and Billy Bob so well from my childhood.  The place was never the same since it changed to Chuck E's, but i liked him better when he was a more Brooklyn/gangster style rat.  Would still be weird to find him and the crew gone though.
Thing is, I don’t think Scott Cawthon would let a Chuck e Cheese/FNAF collaboration with animatronics happen, he himself stated he would never make a real life Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria. But who knows?
hold up so it was an inspired project, that had a rival company that had better animatronics and they competed for some time until eventually they joined forces? someone better check for a certain purple wearing individual hanging around chucky cheese
This isnt true. The 2.0 renovation project started years ago. My local CEC hasnt had animatronics in probably 5+ years. This process has been slowly happening for a while now. They recently announced that they were gonna keep the animatronics at a specific location in California for the sake of preserving the company’s history, but the animatronics being removed is VERY old news.
Nah why’d the appearance of the rat from fnac actually give me chills
6:17 if Chuck E Cheese wanted more business from adults they could lift the restriction that makes it so you have to bring a child to Chuck E Cheese, lots of parentless adults want to go back to Chuck E Cheese for nostalgia or sone other reason but simply can't (ex: me I'm 19 and just wanna go to relive some of the good parts of my childhood yet I'm not allowed to)
Barcades are the only bars I go to, so them thriving doesn't really surprise me.
barcades are on an incline cause the kids who went to chuck-e-cheese are now adults
It’s funny because I went to chucks cheese more after fnaf because it’s fun
Chuck E cheese always had a weird thing with popular media affecting business. About a decade ago mr.nightmare did a reading of a chuck e cheese creepypasta and had to take it down allegedly because the franchise was worried it was affecting business but can now be found via reuploads
I think, I don’t need to have any science classes if I can learn it by watching this man explain fun things like FNAF and other things in videos while explaining science. I think I can actually learn school now!!!!!!
Why aren't there a FNAF restaurants?
I really think there is something to what MatPat is saying. Maybe FNaF is the only way they can save themselves.
Am I the only one who genuinely goes to Chuck E Cheese just for the pizza?
Rock star anamatronics
Random, but I love how even now you and/or your editors still put a random but on-topic image at the end of the videos. Not only for the novelty of it, being how you've done it after what I can only assume is over a decade by now, but because sometimes the images you guys pick genuinely make me chuckle.
I miss the days of hurtling down a twenty-foot slide and getting kicked in the thigh by a twelve-year-old on their way down after me at Monkey Joe's. Oh, to be young, free, and in extreme, sweaty pain.
bro no 🧢 my brother walked up to the guy wearing a chuckee suit and went " Guys is that freddy fazbear!? har har har har har har har har har harrrrr" 😭😭
"a FNOF event"  _dies_
I remember when I was 4, and I went to a few Chuck E. Cheese birthday parties for my friends. I was always fascinated with the animatronics. But little did I realize the year 2014, when I was 4, would be the year of the creation of the FNaF franchise, and the slow downfall of the Chuck E. Cheese franchise.  When I was 10, I came back for another party to find the animatronics not there. Being a FNaF fan since I was 5 (mainly cause I was scared to death of FNaF 4), I had a pretty good idea on why the old robots weren’t there…
i went to chuck e cheese every year for my birthday as a kid just bc i was such a big fnaf fan
I would love a real life fnaf style building/restaurant just to try it out
Okay… you definitely need to cover Pizza Pals Playzone from Meow Wolf Denver. The similarities are so striking.
I’m sorry I want animatronics… if there were any in aus I’d go
I think a chuck-e-cheese merge with FNAF would make a lot of sense for both sides. Will note however, chuck-e-cheese would probably be under the gun by Scott coffin to do everything just right, as per his vision, since he cares so dang much about the franchise.
i would think it would bring more money though would it not? kids LOVE five nights at freddys and well to be honest they dont even really know the lore.. they just watch videos that include the characters
HEY THE CHEESE PIZZA IS AMAZING
Your Cameo was the best thing about the movie.
7:27 “IF i’m a dad” like he isn’t a dad
I got stuck on the old jurassic park ride twice 😂 it broke down all the time. About time they finally fixed it
Chuck E cheese should just incorporate the whole animatronics mystery into it’s restaurants
I found out there is a FNAF Cookbook
We have NOTHING like Chuck E Cheese in the UK... The whole concept fascinates me. I'd love to visit one at least once!
When are you going to make the next eating your tree episode?
Wait… so….. I’m never going to be able to see a real life animatronic made for singing?…… that’s all I’ve ever wanted to do since I became a fan of FNAF when I was like 7…. Oh my god I’m about to cry
weird that they are doing that now, but I will say the animatronics did creep me out as a kid.
The sole idea that FNAF as a brand is already too big as to be bought off, speaks volumes on the place we are now as compared to 2014
Scott would never recreate the FNAF animatronics IRL
idk about you but the dave and busters around me are ALWAYS filled to the brim. and since the bar/restaurant is at its own side, the games are not really distracting. there are barely any kids there anyway.
I’m not paying 120$ for something I can find at a thrift store for 10$ (everything I own is from the thrift store and looks similar)
13:49 if you read the Chuck E. Cheese poster it says “a special appearance by everyone’s favorite purple guy” I mean come on
The thing that killed off Chuck E Cheese is the terrible pizza.   Also as someone whose main animatronics experience was the rubber roaring dinosaurs at the museum someone needs to make a 5 Nights at the Museum.
You know, get a projector, a slanted piece of glass, and a good sound system. Chuck E. Cheese could probably make a killing on having holograms play.  They could even get vocaloids to play there for that otaku crowd!
My favorite eatertainment place, and the only one I like, is Pirates Dinner Adventure. It's an interactive show with human performers doing cool stunts, actually good food, you get to talk to the performers after the show, people can get called up to be an actual part of the show, the performers throw people necklaces (they threw me one when I went there), the story is simple enough for kids to understand but complicated enough where it isn't boring, and it's an experience that I would wanna go to again. It was super fun and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun interactive show.
Honestly, if Chuck E Cheese promised Scott creative control over how the project would be completed (like with the movie), i think Scott would agree to a partnership in a heartbeat. i mean come on. FNAF theory videos have been using a blank chuck e cheese building as the template for  a Freddy's restaurant since the beginning of fnaf. fnaf and chuck e are two sides of the same coin. imagine the BANK FNAF would earn Chuck e cheese by offering a real life Freddy's Pizzaria location Meow Wolf style. the thing would practically *print* money for both companies
despite eatertainment businesses being on the decline, i have no doubts that if Scott Cawthon and other backers threw a couple billion dollars at creating a real-life Mega Pizzaplex indoor mall theme park with all the animatronics, (actually) great food, decent service, and super cool rides and games, it would be a smash hit. people would be coming from other countries to visit. If the FNAF fans can skyrocket the movie in the box office, think about what this fandom could do for a REAL Mega Pizzaplex mall.   my only request is that you ACTUALLY HAVE GLAMROCK BONNIE IM BEGGING YOU! JUSTICE FOR GLAMROCK BONNIE!
I wish Universal had Transformers animatronics.
Wait who a minute did anyone NOT subscribe to the theory’s?
Huh… they took the robots out like 10 years ago
I remeber going there when i was 7, good times man, good times.
andretti
I feel like a guy starting a company with animatronics based off his childhood and then having to deal with a rival company sounds a bit familiar.
I think a good reason I love fnaf so much is that when I was little I loved the animatronics and I wanted to go to Chuck E. Cheese just for them
To be fair the 4 around my area hasn't had them for years.
MatPat is goin insane
Food theroy idea  Compare the food price increase to inflation and see if it's really inflation or a way for companys to make more money
Food theory idea is the Goya drink Malta a juice or a soda ?
Does anyone know what happened to the intro song? I haven’t heard it in a while 😢
I was creeped out by the animatronics at Chuckie Cheese WAY before FNAF was even a thing so I do not think  FNAF is responsible for Chuckie Cheese closing or changing how they run their restaurants.
Can you do a food theory about how to get safe water in a nuclear fallout.
lets be honest mcdonalds started this trend when they removed thier playgrounds
I can't help but really dislike the decision made to destruct the old animatronics instead of selling them off to people who want to keep them alive
a fazbears fright style chucke cheese restauraunt would be soo cool
im out of touch.  i don't know what FNAF is
2.7k
Haven caravan parks UK
Anyone notice that when someone says subscribe the button lights up
I personally find it hilarious that theory about people will get cold feet from animatronic just because they watched FNAF exists... honestly FNAF is just fictional story, we are talking about a universe where cops doesn't give an eff about 6 missing children on a small establishment with security camera, and apparently william afton can just murk those children without single evidence or somehow he can keep authorities away from his workshop... it's just silly backstory meant to enhance horror flick of the game its not meant to depict the real animatronic.. people nowadays😂😂
If Chuck E Cheese changed their name to FNAF and made it all about the thrill factor they would globally be the most successful fear eatertainment establishment. Look how much money FNAF just as a game pulls in every single year: Let alone the merch sales, movie sales and all the YouTube videos about the theories, Easter eggs and story lore; combined with a Mega Corporation rebranding and your talking domination over the whole fear and fun industry!
killed chucke e cheese like fazbear killed five people in chuck e cheese
Unironically if there was ever a horror themed restaurant inspired by FNAF I would go. I would drive across the country just for that.
Do a video of all of your fan encounters recently
Do you want to experience FNAF in the real world? be chuck e cheese's night Guard without buying vr :)
You should do a theory on jordan fast food series
Mat Pat season 2 of short wars
Jumpscare for me! I almost flew out of that jurassic park ride on the big drop in 2005. happy to see it go finally!
Hope matpat is hinting at his next business opportunity....
When I was a kid, I was always afraid that the animatronics would grab me if I got to close to the stage. I think I might have even had a nightmare.
I have only ever been to Show Biz Pizza. Kids of the 80s know.
I'm good on the Merch, I always get my clothes at Foreman Mills. Perfect for budget shopping
How long can you survive a mall
They should literally like build a pizza plex im js saying
honestly people being scared of fnaf and animtronics from watching and playing fnaf i know people like I'm one of the people who llved fnaf i know many people even friends tramtised by it they still can't and were older tgen i was 19 soon talking
I think they just couldnt afford animatronics, because they have trouble with money especially because of the pandemic.
how about a pizza timeline
We got our first ever chucky cheese in our country two years ago and there were no animatronics .only people in mascot costumes
Hey MatPat there’s a fnaf cookbook that’s out. Try doing a food theory on it.
$138!? FOR A JACKET!? I would buy it if I wasn't broke
Question: Is your dishwasher _truly_ getting your dirty dishes fully washed and clean ( _free of all the bad germs and bacteria_ ) down to the microscopic level?
They should just open a Freddy's Dinner with animatronics, and all the kids will ask their parent if they can have FNAF money, hahhaa
Wait, Rockstar animatronics
4 year olds when chuck e cheese goes away. it will make someone cry.
Collaboration with fnaf wouldn’t really work Scott said that a real location wouldn’t exist for fear of someone actually recreating the fnaf events but even still just lean into the animatronic horror with your own characters and don’t use fnaf people would still eat it up
Billybobs Wonderland in Barboursville, WV has a fully operational Rockafire Explosion show. I just spoke with the owner when I was there and they plan on having a haunted animatronic attraction in the future! He even met with Aaron Fechter at the most recent IAAPA. They have pictures up on the wall of FNAF characters that fans have drawn and brought in, a whole door with pictures of FNAF, and they even have FNAF plushies at the prize counter!! They’re embracing it and I think that’s going to work in their favor!!! (Also, their pizza was actually delicious AND they had fried pickles!!)
You can see it maho… chuck e cheese, my mascot horror brand
You lost me at benihana, that place is amazing. I go every year for my birthday and I'm almost 30
this dude has some of the best merch ive seen from a creator. bravo
MATPAT, at 1:41 i am heartbroken to hear you leave out my favorite animatronic character ever, JASPER T. JOWLS!!! chuck, pasqually, munch, and helen? ARENT YOU FORGETTING SOMEONE??!?!?!?
Although it would be a boom in business if Chuck E. Cheese collaborated with fnaf we all know someone will try to recreate the events that’s why Scott doesn’t want to capitalize on it great idea on paper but realistically it’s a nightmare
They do want to shut it down because America is not free but  extreme radical regime How much you want to bet it will be overseas? Save animatronics save USA
I only want the pizza in chuck E.        Cheese the pizza is 👍
You know the rockstar animatronics are an actual part of the FNAF cannon.
theory for Matpat is there a blend of 23 flavours in the Dr Pepper authentic blend of 23 flavours edition or is it just a lie ???
you know, now that i think about it, ive almost never seen any eatertainment locations here in europe (i mean maybe i just live under a rock but it doesnt seem to be as big as in the US). i know of exactly one place that opened earlier this year, but it was really small and far from where i live, so i probably wont be coming back. otherwise i can only think of places that are in theme parks or vacation parks. i think its kind of a shame really. also, themeparks and such phasing out animatronics is so lame to me (but i mean im not surprised). a video on a screen is just kind of boring to look at and the animatronics are interesting and can be impressive. but also im a technology nerd so i am biased but still. if theyre just gonna show everything on screens, its not far off from just putting you in a cart and then having you watch a video on your phone lol i feel like leaning into the horror could maybe be good for CEC, but i dont know, i mean its quite a different direction from what they were before, so it could also work against them
Never been to a chuck E cheese
I want a Food Theory on why pregnant women always seems to crave for pickles!!!
Here is a good food theory idea: how long can you survive in the food thats stored inside a Airbus a380
Remember when matpat theorised about the cannabis industry and how it will be legalised? I’d like a whole theory about that subject.
Please do a video of tzuyang!!
I'M BEGGING YOU TO DO THE NUTTER BUTTER ARG
Now would be a perfect time for Scott to make his own franchise resterants 😂
How long could somebody survive in the FNAF pizzeria
feddy fazbear lol
MatPat's long game was always to get Chuck E. Cheese to convert the Aurora, CO location from the first FNaF GT video into an immersive Freddy's location. As someone who had a birthday at that location I would 100% go back if they teamed up with Steel Wool or something
na bro said wrong channel
SEND THIS TO THE OFFICIAL CHUCK E CHEESE ACCOUNTS
This has been going on since 2019. (CEC removing the animatronics)
give mat a pat on the back for this world changing video!
The other big difference between eatertainment and a barcade is the type of games. Barcades are focused on actual acarde games and pinball. While the eatertainment games are just a vehicle for getting tickets to buy cheap junk.
0:51 Carl the Cupcake
@The Food Theorist Mattpatt heres one for your mind to descript IS CHEESE CAKE , A "PIE OR A CAKE"?
why bro put a photo of the people who cook in front of you i would go to those places everyday if i could their awesome
😅 that rainforest cafe at 7:50 is the only one I’ve ever been to. I recognized it immediately
9:55 Matt has entered his full on dad phase
0:59 - It says b1t3 - 87 Reverence to bite - 87 or the of bite of 87
Hey mat pat, I want to suggest you do a  theory on ware chocolate comes from and who harvests it, I got my inspiration for making a suggestion from this video   Chocolate: last week tonight with John Oliver  Have a nice day bye-bye!
you should talk about the pepperami commercials.
the amount of money that i would spend on a chuck e. cheese fnaf collab would be astronomical
Used to love chukys place when I was a kid the tubes hanging from the ceiling the ball pit the rocket ship ride the animatronics …oh wait all of that has been removed
It’s a good point. Iv spent maybe $10000 on video games? But other entertainment probably adds up to near $600000! You can get a doll set for what like $150? That will last between a day and a month. A $70-$90 game will last 2 days to 5 years. But the older you get I find the more selective you are with what’s worth your time and money
Congrats on 5 mil subs
Really - FNAF should become a real pIzza place - Animatronics and all. I'd go!
The one in North Charleston SC hasn't had animatronics for at least 10 years or more
The animatronics were always expensive to maintain and often didn't work because it was too much to keep them working. Add in FNAF making animatronics scary and it was a no brainer for them to finally just scrap the whole thing.  (Comment made before watching video)
I think a eating location mixed with animatronics, arcade games, horror and maybe even a interactive mystery to solve for the guests that the employees were in on would be a big hit attraction.  Either way, animatronics are a part of entertainment history. They deserve to be preserved, at the very least for others to learn about.
Pizza and you're the best return to Omega Mart
I’am loving it ba da ba ba baaaaaa
03:34 "and that was how i was born" mr. Hippo
"Down fall of the rat"💀
Went to chuck e cheese many times as a child. Took my own daughter there many times. Went with my girls grand baby two days ago. Half the machines in the game are unplayable due to lack of maintenance. It was dead and empty and the employees were reading manga in the seats. They even had a legacy area for anyone who still had tokens and none of the machines worked. I remember a time when you could potentially get enough tickets to buy a PlayStation. Now, the most expensive thing there is 17.99 and its franchise licensed prizes… chucks hat or the purple guys Schwag… it’s dead… been dead
Two things they should’ve done. 1. Invest in robotics and have ai bots there 2. Lean in to fnaf during Halloween and then ditch the bots after lol
This is completely unrelated to FNAF, or anything in this video, and I have a feeling you'll never see this comment lol. But my boyfriend just told me that his mum used to make him "Nettle soup" whenever he was sick and it always worked, as in nettles you'd find in back gardens and forests and things??? He also just told me he wants to try "Nettle tea"? Honestly idk what to make of it, and I was hoping you might be able to help me make sense of it? Lol
I'd love to see a collab 🤩🤩
I had my 10th birthday at Chuck E Cheese.  For adults it’s nostalgia.  I would 💯 go to a Horror FNAF themed Barcade.   MAKE IT SO!!!
I would love a real Fnaf restaurant and animatronics, but you know what I would love more, a Ness animatronic
Dude that would have been nuts if we somehow got a chuckee cheese fnaf crossover of some kind instead of the two avoiding eachother I would have went to go see whatever it was and I’m 20 now. Man time flew my friend showed me game theorist way back in middle school and iv been watching ever sense now im sitting here jamming to game theorist content during my nightshift at work crazy how time flies and things change also watching any fnaf theory or other content while on my night shift feels kinda well ya know I guess I can relate to the night gaurd with the being tired from the hours I gotta work sense it’s the opposite of what we are typically used to idk point is I love ya game theorist thanks for makeing my childhood ill continue to watch on untill I have kids and show you to them. Gosh saying me with kids sounds kinda funny and hard to imagine but its inevitable haha peace out
bwuhj
Someone tell matpat to use his big brain to find best price for his clothing instead of finding the best food and stuff
Five Nights  Of Fun  Five  Nights  At Freddie
Video idea HERSHEY'S VS FEASTABLES which is better?
Video idea HERSHEY'S VS FEASTABLES which is better?
3:37 That sounds exactly like what happened in the FNAF lore.
Honestly I liked the animatronics at universal. The dinosaurs were really cool jumping out. Better than looking at screens. We look at screens all day practically. Why would anyone want more of that in place you go to get away from screens. Better in real life experiences are worth it. I went on the Spider-Man ride and I wasn’t impressed because it was all screens. It just wasn’t as fun as feeling like you’re actually in a location.
personally am rlly good at giant flappy bird
12:45 I have that exact megumin figure. I love it
I actually have a friend that goes out of her way to get their pizza. Our local CEC did take out pizza all pandemic and she may have kept them in business all by herself. No idea how anyone can choose CEC for Pizza with regular pizza around.  Oh, did I fail to mention we live on Long Island!!!
I loved you in the FNAF movie.
3:58 bro used the wrong freddy 💀
My mom worked at chuck-e-cheese as a teen and when she was watching the FNAF movie with me, especially right when they enter for the first time, she kept pausing and telling me about how much it looked the same. The employee video, the rack, apparently even the layout of the games!
4:47 let's not forget that before the pandemic a certain youtuber with a big following made a theory about there pizza. I'm sure that also did damage to chuck e cheese.
Anyone else find it sad in the background, because he was in it, and its so ingrained in his channels image that MP has to pretend FNAF movie was good?  31%Rotten Tomatoes 5.5/10IMDb  33%Metacritic ...........
I for one actually liked chuck e cheese pizza
As soon as you said chucky cheese/fnaf pair up bro I'd pay for a little haunted house set up. Bro that would be cool af.
Exactly, things like this take quite a while to happen. From approval to actual removal
I think Chuck E. Cheese would benefit from a colab with FNAF maybe colab with the brand and open a few irl Freddy fazzbear pizzarias nationwide it would draw in more people and have more people willing to buy their nightmare pizzas.
Fnaf was a horrible movie. Waste of my time. Love the game hate the movie.
Wait there are still Chuck E. Cheese restaurants with animatronics?! The one in my hometown got rid of them almost 5 years ago.
I would go to a horror chuck e cheese.
as someone who works at mcdonalds, my least favorite time was when the grimace shake was being sold. smh
They really need to dig into it, I totally agree. They'd have my money!!!
Sooo basically shoebox is Henry and chucky cheese is Afton apparently they’re not all that different
I'll miss the weird creepy old animatronics at Chuck E Cheese it used to give them an 'old' feel and that's how I liked it. I will miss Jasper the dog. RIP
Day 2 of trying to be “that guy”
mat pat just giving out free advice
𝚃𝙷𝚄𝙼𝙱 𝙷𝙾𝙻𝙴𝚂!!!!!!!!!!!!
Unfortunately yes. Chucky is now dead. It was dying for a long time, and this was the final nail
Ok, make more modern animatronics tho... like i know maintenance is a thing but animatronics are awesome dude
I think that would actually be really really cool if Chuck E. Cheese did this
all because a rat said "Poggers!"
Bro pulled chuck e. Cheese government name. Also those animatronics have been creepy long before fnaf. It probably was part due to fnaf and partly due to people just not taking their kids to that establishments
its a shame to see it end up this way, ever since i was like 7 i dreamt of going here but as i live in the uk, i never got to experience something quite like chuck e cheese but i always promised myself that id go when i was older  well that aged like milk
I love Chuck E. Cheese pizza and idk why
More people should call Charles Entertainment Cheese 'Chuck'
Simple answer. PLACES ARE TO EXPENSIVE 😓
Man CES needs to hire this "bussines" man.
William afton ahh story ngl
I used to work at chuck e cheese and I couldn't bring it up to the people else I get fired
the only thing that would make me go to a chucks would be the animatronics
126,45€???????
I don’t know if it’s weird to say this but a few weeks back I was at a Chuck E. cheese’s for my nieces birthday. After a few hours the lights went out because of a power outage and all I could think of was FNAF. It was by far the best experience I had that day.
Whats insane is i went to warch fanaf last month with my bf, now ex. I had been wanting so long and he wanted a date night and i saw an opportunity. We got to the theater and literally, we were the only people there. We had the entire theater by ourselves. Worked perfectly because i got super excited abd loud when i saw mat pat on screen. We were also cracking jokes and somewhat criticizing. I was expecting to see a bunch of kids and teens but nope
The utility bill is happy, i am happy, but... the cat is not happy, BUT THAT IS JUST A THEORY, A FLUFFY THEORY! JUST LIKE OUR CLOTHES THAT WE ARE TRYING TO SELL YOU!
The animatronics were expensive and difficult to maintain and repair. That’s the only reason they’re being phased out.
Bruh, dude, I live in South Africa, the merch is too expensive.
I think matpat is losing it
When Matpat was talking about the creator of Chuck E Cheese, I swear it was as if he was talking about William lol
old sport
Who does he mean by rat lurking in the shadows? Its at the end of the video
Bro just be saving dying bossiness left, right and center, he would make a great CEO if he ever wants to buy the brand
Where's the yearly eat ur christmas tree video 👀
Dude my local barcade has very well priced drinks (averaging 6 bucks for a cocktail) and as long as you buy 1 drink free arcade games all night!
As a scare actor I can confirm people will SWARM to scary stuff. On one of our busier days this year we had about 8,000 people at our haunt. Also yes animatronics are annoyingly hard to maintain. We had a few break on us this year, one huuuge one that was a wraith hung like 10ft in the air even fell face first into the ground in front of customers…that was a chaotic night
I'm still processing the fact that I predicted the downfall and mass shutdown of Chuck E. Cheese establishments. This prediction happened a few months prior to covid. I kept having dreams of them shutting down.
That card with responds SCREAMS 80's 😂
Wheres Ronald McDonald
DO NOT CREATE TOY CHICA IN REAL LIFE, SO MUCH BAD STUFF WILL COME FROM THAT
Not gonna lie, I'm kinder of sad. I haven't been to a Chuck E. Cheese since I learned about FNAF. Was hoping to go back one day to see the animatronics, but family never had a reason to go.
I'd say Chuckie did his job in scaring me when I was a kid. 20+ years later and I still can't look a mascot costume in the face without feeling anxious.
When will we get the style theory episode for FNAF where MatPat explains how to cram a corpse into an animatron in a stylist way?
I mean i wouldnt mind a FnaC irl location, just sayin
MatPat I really need to know. I was at the store with my girl and we  wanted to have crab tonight for dinner. But there are  so many options of crab these days with drastically different prices. The ranges of these prices are crazy. They could be even double or even triple the price of the cheaper crab legs. Which crab has the most meat to shell ratio for the best price? And flavor of course.
I work at a location that has never had them but our tech has worked with them,they are to expensive to maintain. That’s why there usually in horrible conditions id love to work with them tho honestly
Wow, did NOT expect to see the Main Event in this video. Went there last Christmas, pretty fun, but the VR attractions weren't set up to have adjustable headbands and uh.. well, to put it bluntly, I have a big head so I wasn't able to play those. Oh and I didn't do the Gravity Ropes, not that I *couldn't* but I sadly have clubbed feet as an adult so I figured it was not a good idea.
Before this gets a little too popular Chuck E. Cheese said that the animatronics are staying in locations In California which makes me happy that the animatronics are not going to waste
they actually made a Halloween short that was totally not fnaf a while back
I would love you see chucky cheese merge with fnaf and see the animatronics come to life
6:33 I'm sorry? Beer just being pass around? NO! This can't legal in a kids restaurant. Also just how many frickin adults even drink alcohol in any capacity? I don't, why would this catch on? You could have some drunkard ruin a kid's birthday. Both Chucky Cheese and or the guy could be sued for letting this stuff happen by introducing LITERAL BEER into the establishment. Nobody's ready nor willing to pay for that, especially on a day meant for celebration.
Scott specifically didnt want to make fnaf a real thing tho because he thinks some lunatic will try to recreate the murders and stuffing dead kids in suits thing sooo it probably wont happen tbh
Was that the bite of 2024?
Glamrock Chuck-
The timeline sounds suspiciously like fnaf ultimate‘s
Aurora Borealis? In this time of year? Localised entirely on MatPat channels???
Things are not looking good for Teddy Williams, owner of the Desert Flower Bowling Alley and Arcade Fun Complex
Mattpat I think you forgot about the rockstar animatronics in fnaf 6
Food Theory Idea: I was watching the 1994 Santa Clause movie and there was a scene with an elf Judy giving Scott hot cocoa, as she explains the cocoa's intricate recipe. I want to know how to make the ULTIMATE hot cocoa based on the types of milk you can use, chocolate powder brands, styles of mixing, temperatures, etc. Love your vids 🤪❤🎅🎄
AHH YOU REMINDED ME ABOUT TEDDY BURBACK AND NOW I NEED HIM TO EAT AT EVERY HARD ROCK IN THE COUNTRY IDK WHY THEY DID IT BUT I LOVED IT 😭
Real Chuck E Cheese fans know that Desperate Acts of Capitalism killed Chuck back in 2020....
lol
How much money would you get if you took all the display money from a average money pit (not cash register)
AHHH THEY NEED TO BUILD A REAL FAZZBEARS PIZZA COMON SCOTT MONEY YOU LEAVING ON THE TABLE.
I worked for chucke cheese for 25 years every single day for those 25 years on the night shift you can just hear weird noises coming from the hallways. One night i even heard a robotic scream almost paranormal. Man i will never go near the animatronics again you really cant be too careful! Was it Fnaf that killed chuckecheese or did Fnaf bring to light what is actually going on?
We had a dance floor at my local ChuckE.Cheese for a while now and the kids love it. The baby gets to play with her brothers and i can watch them while sitting. Chuck still comes out every hourish to give the kids tickets
Okay okay I have to admit lately their pizza has been really good! VERY over priced, but it was for birthday parties so there was a discount.
Chuck E. Cheese's pizza SUCKED!
I remember there’s a Barcadia down in the city (not going there since it’s in a bad area), but we ended up getting a better one nearby called Game On & it has laser tag, bowling, axe throwing, arcade, & a bar
Imagine an eatertainer with modern and appealing Glamrock animatronics, for example. It’s not impossible. It could actually be fun.
Funny that they implemented alcohol to the Chuck e menu but the parents tend to complain that they’re limited 2 drinks per separate IDs, which makes sense considering all the kids around of course
:>)
My toddler loves that interactive dance floor, btw.
I think, if Chuck E. Cheese re-branded to an adult eatery based off of horror themes, obviously like FNAF, they would FLOURISH
I've been saying for years that C.E.C should lean in to the FNaF angle. It would only be a boon for them
They should just buy out licensing rights to FNAF build a restaurant similar to the first game, an horror experience where you have some time to eat (make the pizza not literal cardboard) advertise it to late teens and early adults and I would bet that would do good.
🎉
Horror theroy disliked and didnt watch. more content variety.
I knew fnaf didn’t affect Chuck E Cheese because the animatronics have been removed and added the digital screen for about a few years now at my location before everyone started talking about the movie. But I just wanted to say I enjoy the pizza at Chuck E Cheese no need to bash it now even if it looks recycled 😔
Bro I remember Chuck E Cheese! Or at least the “spin offs”/cheaper versions.. wow that brings back some memories. The 90s/2000s were so silly 😂. If I were Chuck E Cheese I would totally capitalize on the FNAF hype. I am not really a fan of FNAF. But it could be fun for some people! Just imagine the work they could do.  Chuck E Cheese would be worth visiting as an adult after all these years.
I need to know the true speed of ginger bread,man
Sooooo fun story: Chuck E. Cheese was definitely selling beer back in the early-mid 90s because that’s the only way we could convince my great-grandmother to go with us! I can’t remember where for sure (my dad’s job moved us around a lot as kids) but it was either in Tampa or Jackson, MS. The thing I do remember though is having my tiny mind blown when my great-grandmother ordered herself a pitcher of beer and told my parents that was the only reason she would tolerate being there!
I love the look of all the winter wear *cries in Floridian*
me and my daughter LOVE Five Nights at Freddy, growing up i hated Chuck E. Cheese, but my six year old daughter has been begging me to take her to Chuck E. cheeses for her birthday because she wants to see the creepy mouse animatronic
It would be so cool if Chuck E Cheese collaborated with Scott Cawthon and turned their losing restaurants into official real Freddys Pizzerias. They would gain so much interest and people would drive from different states just to visit them.
If anything - as a FNaF fan I would've loved to visit a place like Chuck E Cheese! I mean, who wouldn't want to see actual animatronics perform for you while you eat some pizza?
nah if anything it introduced millions of kids to the love of animatronics imo chucky cheez is the closest thing to fnaf
I am impressed. Matpat talking about FNAF and managing to avoid talking about FNAF lore.
i love that merch is SOOOOO EXPENSIVE its 512 shekels (my monthly payment is 1100)
Isn't the restaurant franchise wants to open water park now?
0:03 0:03 0:03
I want five nights at chuckys...
See the fnaf series  is the reason i last went to chuckecheese
Yeah
I’d be interested in a video about short-form content and its effects on mental health and attention span
4:04 shame matpat did not bring up Rockstar Freddy, the one from FNaF 6
Mr. Nightmare killed chuckie cheese
1:00 ah yes, the BT of 13-87
PLEASE do a food theory on the 5 second rule!!
Chuck E Cheese is gonna close soon.
Chuck E. Cheese died waaaaaay back in the 80s Showbizz pizza place was where it was at & I don’t even know why they closed them places down .
Shane Dawson killed Chuck E. Cheese
I think there’s also the fact that Chuck E Cheese doesn’t want to be associated with the shooting that happened in Aurora, Colorado.
God bless all of you and remember God loves you all and so do I may God be with you all. Jesus is coming soon God bless repent🙏💛
My theory is that COVID killed Chuckycheese
Chuck E Cheese's would have closed down years ago if it weren't for FNAF. FNAF is why Chuck E Cheese's is still relevant, because "it's just like FNAF." If they totally rebranded as Fazbear Entertainment and opened up Freddy Fazbear's pizzerias they would make BANK.
TEAM THEORIST I GOT A WEIRD ONE!  We know there's certain foods that act as laxatives to...well...make them *pass through* faster and easier. However, we never consider #2's sister, #1. What drink causes #1's call of nature occur the fastest?  Is it water, since our bodies already have so much of it? Is it something with way more sugar, that we need to expel? What is your theory, team theorist?
Soooo it’s mouse.AVI then
I SAW that Bite 83-87 in that intro for this episode Mat! 😂
Well in fnaf 6 there is the Rockstars
Am I the only one waiting for the eating a Christmas tree episode
Veryyy good thumbnail. I clicked because of it keep the great work 👌
I love the subtle yet poignant distinction between kids and grown up kids at 6:16
If they collabed and made a FNAF restaurant in real life I would spend SO MUCH MONEY for that!!!
TBH that aurora Jacket looks so good
They are taking them away for now to update to look of them. Since majority of the chuck E animatronics look like the early 2000’s version and not the version that is used now.
god if fnaf and chucky collabed for a fnaf restaurant i would be there in a flash. if a fnaf pizzeria opened anywhere i'd be there in a flash. So long as the animatronics are actually freddy and the gang..
Maybe we should get Batim moive to ruin Disney 😂
this is EXACTLY what ive been thinking
I mean every time I go to chucky cheese now I feel like I'm in the fnaf movie or game 🤔
The backpack I bought 3 years ago it still looks nice
8:49 Restock your FNAF wears my dude!!!!
i actually do love the chuck e cheeses pizza, idk whats about it but I just love it for some reason
At 5 minutes I had the thought that it’s gotta be cell phones some how
To be fair Chuck E. Cheese was already dead
there’s a baracde nearby and it is SO FUN.
Definitely not, before fnaf even got *big* I worked at Chuck e cheese. Right after Mark posted his first video on it actually. The animatronics were already gone and there was the light up dance floor in place. Definitely not removing the animatronics because of fnaf. Fnaf is likely just hurrying along the project because employees are more than likely over answering the same questions over and over.
Didn’t Scott Cawthon say that he never wanted to make FNaF in real life? I would love to see the main band in Chuck E. Cheese, but I’m not sure either companies would agree to a collaboration.
Shane Dawson killed Chuck E. Cheese
If Chuck E. Cheese rebrands as a horror attraction, does Fnaf sue?
You should do a theory about how much the reindeer eat on Christmas eve. The one where you did the same thing with Santa was really cool, and I know that it is a lot of people's tradition to leave out carrots or candy canes for the reindeer as well
Ello! Just for those who are curious, the horror-themed barcade featured at 13:15 is actually my uncle's bar: The 4th Horseman! It's located in Long Beach, California for anyone who wants to drop by and support them. ^-^
Chuck e cheese and fnaf aren’t enemies
fnaf really taking overall the channels 💀
Can someone just AT the chuckle cheese corp. team cause he got a point lol
Personally? I don’t think eatertainment is dying, I think animatronics as an art is dying. You say that the use of projections instead of well made animatronics is far better, but if you go on the attractions you mentioned they just feel lifeless aside from Mickey and Minnie’s. You’d think no animatronic based attractions are thriving, but look at places like Tokyo Disney who consistently provide top notch animatronics in a way you’ve never seen before.
mate the fnaf movie wasnt even that scary what are you on about
Chucky endless suffering cheese
FACT : FnaF is based on the Chucky Cheese shooting that happened in Colorado.  The exact path you take in the beginning is the same path the shooter took.   Thats why i have never cared for fnaf.  It happened next to my house basically.
I NEED that sweater with Thumbholes, but I’m too broke 😭😭
yall got i it twisted chuck e cheese getting rid of the animatronics along with the bodies 👀
Short anwser: yes
so fnaf 3 ?
not the theorists doing all the analytics for them marketing departments
MatPat should make a new channel called;  ✨ Fnaf theories ✨
Dork Diaries lore please 🙏🙏🥺🥺🙏🥺
So which of these animatronics have dead kids in them?
So in this video we learn that the FNAF lore is basically just an overcomplication of the real history of Chuck E Cheese.  Originally a robotics engineer was amazed by animatronic shows, started an own pizzeria with them and was ripped off with a superior brand, then had to merge with that to survive.  Now just like in the FNAF lore, the key to the franchise‘s survival is turning the old kid‘s pizzeria into a horror attraction. All of this is happening exactly like in the lore, in 2023.
Does anyone remember Odyssey Fun World? It was like a Chuck E Cheese but dialed up to 11. It was more of a kids arcade than a restaurant but if you had a birthday party there, the party rooms had a stage with animatronics and they barely worked as well.
I'd literally sell my legs to walk into a chuck e cheese and have it turn into an animatronics escape room
Chuck E Cheese's history is quite literally FNAF. minus the dead kids.
Rockstar Chuck E. predates any glamrock animatronics idk why you’re implying otherwise
Honestly I believe it’s a thing where people actually want to play games and not try to win tickets. Most games in those industries have them set up to try to win lots of tickets despite most of them being rigged. They try to drag kids in with colorful prizes and that big stuffed animal that nobody ever wins. People and even kids have slowly realized that the tickets aren’t worth it and they just want to play the games. And since that’s what most of those places are mostly filled with they start to see a decline. But that’s just my take.
I agree with the approach chuck e cheese needs to make here, but there is another option to keep the band and lower costs.... Hatsune Miku
Actually, this would be sO COOL IF THEY JUST BECAME LIKE AN ABANDONED THINGY THAT HAS SPOOKY ANIMATRONICS
you know scott is probably a good person and would love to work with chuck e cheese and i might go there more too
THE CALL WAS COMING FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE
I mean either way animatronics or not it can still be considered FNaF related. For example in the games they got rid of the og animatronics and they became withered. Now chuck e cheese gets rid of them welllll...... people can say they would become withered
15:02 ok no, use the animatronics from ONE GAME, not three.
I like how mat forgot about the rockstar animatronics from pizzarea simulator.
What is the best food for a weapon
is there going to be a restock of fnaf merch?
we all know more kids know freddy fazebear than chuck e cheese
I say why not embrace the horror instead of fightinf it?  Imagine some Chucky E Cheeze resturants necome AFTUAL REAL LIFE Freddy Fazbear, like a semi-LARP(Live Action Roleplay) experience, where the employees either wear FNAF mascots and jumpscare some customers, hiding fake dead body-parts in animatronic suit or backrooms   And for a unique suprising prank for birthdays and what not, people can pay for a unique experience where the birthday boy will be "kidnapped by a purple guy and stuffed in one of the suits"   There will be creepy arcade games, uncanny noises and experiences. It would be kind of aimilar to the Horror Attraction - however it would actually be a Pizzaeria/restaurent as well -THERE COULD EVEN BE A SIDE STAGE WITH MR. HIPPO!   And since some of the restaurents are Chucky E Cheese while others are Freddy's there is no fear of losing kids as audiance....   Honestly though I would simply create FNAF-like restaurents and have it both ways in a very simple way.  Daytime and nightrime. Duaring the day the restuarents would be more kids friendly, duaring the might however it would be a horror experience restaurent.
What I want now is a Gatorade cake
can you do a food theory on the 23 flavors of dr. pepper?
I'd say do a FNAF 3 and showcase how the mascots that may or may not move when you're not looking evolved over the years with a museum track with the restaurant area at the end of the experience. Even have two entrances to let people who just want to eat and enjoy go in without having to deal with the horror tripping people.
Food theory idea. What happened to the average man eat McDonald’s for one year?🍟🍔
Tbf Chuck E design is so much worse then all of FNaF characters xD Not a single picture I ever saw looked appealing
Charles Entertainment Cheese🤣🤣🤣🤣
Okay then make actual Freddy Fazbear's family diners worldwide.
Soooo. Were not gonna talk about how Chuck. E. Cheeses looks like a rainbow exploded prison cafeteria?
💜
about 8-9 years ago, my cousin and i were such big fnaf fans so for his 10th birthday we went to chuck e cheese to "interrogate" employees, asking about a purple guy and the bite of 87 😭
Animatronics are a dying breed, and people should respect them more. Respect the ACTUAL animatronics, stop screwing with the greats. Ive always loved them. The band is amazing, the characters is amazing, and I wish they'd be held onto more. Like in a museum.
The main issue with making FNaF a real restaurant is (and i think its been said many times) is that some sicko is actually going to try and do the missing kids incident irl
I want you to explain how the tubes from splatburger from The Thundermans work
Yes hello, did you know that lunch is the most important meal of the day, some people think it’s breakfast but that’s just a theory.
I wish Scott would give us 1 just ONE fnaf pizza location IRL animatronics and all imagine a real life Fred bears family diner
1:59 "blome" what is a blome
Honestly, Round 1 seems to be doing pretty good still, but they're more based in Japan and us weebs love thinking we're not spending the same 60 to get that imported figurine instead of just buying it
First theory I strongly disagree with merging fnaf and chuck E Cheese would be a disaster Scott Cawthon(creator of fnaf) said a few years back when Chuck E Chesse went bankrupt said he would never buy and try to reproduce the animatronics in a pizzeria due to their being a chance that some sicko would try to replicate the events of the first game in real life and I fear that if Chuck E Chesse leaned into horror it could result in people dying due to what Scott said about why he wouldn’t recreate a real life horror pizzeria I honestly think Chuck E Chesse should just give up nothing lasts forever and we will always cherish the good times we had with the place but we shouldn’t evolve it into horror for the safety of people because you never know what could happen so you should never risk it.
The fact is Chuck E. Cheese was in a financial downward spiral fast.   Kids just aren't that interested in playing outdated arcade games when they could be at home playing Fortnite instead.
I love the idea that freddy fazbear couldve been a topic in a legitimate meeting
I love that the solution is just “make FNAF real”
POV:YOUR COMPANIES ARE FAILING  JUST PULL A FNAF
Best case scenario: Scott buys out Chuck E. Cheese and changes it all to be a real Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria
A Chuckecheese x fnaf collab is something the fandom has basically been asking for for years. At this point it feels like the pride of chuckecheese is getting in the way of it making money
Matt I'm begging you to stop considering this post-pandemic. The pandemic never "ended" just because people got bored and the media wanted people to go out shopping again. The brain damage caused by Long Covid is only getting more common among all ages (including pets) and is spread even among asymptomatic cases when people don't even know they have it, and certainly aren't testing anymore. Not to mention the 20k hospitalized for it just last week in the US. I only hope you will be the type to look more deeply into this instead of going along with what's easier for the day to day.
About 2 years ago i went to ChuckECheese for my little cousins birthday it was already weirdly modernized, i was very disappointed not to see my favourite creepy stage they had there when i was her age (around 6).
What does this have to do with food... Or are you guys running out of food theory ideas?
I think so …..I seen a Chuck E. Cheese frame and the walls getting removed ….. I haven’t went to Chuck E. Cheese in a long time
they had the animatronics taken out when i was there like 4 months ago very sad
The fnaf Lore and chuckecheese go hand in hand let’s be frank besides the killings
True fact, i got to watch the fnaf movie on the 26th over the 27th
I'm not even really into fnaf and I think that idea would be so freaking cool!
What's with the boring new products you're trying to pass off as Theorywear? Didn't see the logo on a single thing you showcased. I don't buy Team Theory merch for generic, bland label clothes, I buy it to sport and share the channels. Boo, sir. Boo.
Every time I went to ChuckE Cheese as a kid and every time I saw those animatronic nightmares I hid under the table.
You're tripping, Chuck E Cheese's Pizza is GREAT.
Rockstar chuck E.   “Please deposit five coins”
Did anyone else all of a sudden notice chucky looks kinda like Freddy, and Chika looks like the chicken, and Munch looks like Bonny
I Miss Benihana… There was a great one that me and my grandparents went to in the Royal York Hotel that recently closed down during the pandemic. I’ll miss the addictive mustard/Soy sauce combo, the Onion volcanos, and the mushroom Soup with enough salt to have a heart attack.
heck maybe they should do a fnaf collab
I think they'll just make the animatronics simpler and scarier
The fact that 13 year olds count as gen Z concerns me. Im 22. I think someone forgot how generations work. 😂😂😂
0:42 even the time line wouldn't work for that, you don't announce something like that with details within a week of something, unless it's an all-hands-on-deck emergency.  this should not have been that.
I doubt a real Freddy Fazbear’s location is gonna happen (at least as long as Scott owns the rights to FNAF). I remember hearing that Scott never wants to create a real Freddy’s location because he knows that someone would try to recreate the events from the franchise (and while I hate to admit it, he is very likely right).
Two rival restaurants sounds familiar...
Can you give a theory on mac & cheeseburger
It’s not that people want horror (irl is horrific enough on it’s on) it’s controlled catered horror, because st the end they know they can walk to the end of the experience and it’s back to the irl horrors. It’s escapism that’s being comidefied with experiences. Honestly though I would rather have a nice watch, mechanical watches are pretty neat!
Mat said "Freddy and the gang" and my brain immediately jumped to scooby doo which was just really confusing
Never knew that the real life chuck e cheese lore has parallels to fnaf lore... why aren’t more people talking about this
There's a Chuck E Cheese near where I live, and if there was ever a FNaF collab, I'd go over and over even just by myself!
It has been many years since the decision to remove them and many higher capacity stores haven’t have the animatronics for years…
I went to Chuck E Cheese last summer for my nibbling's birthday and they had already removed their animatronics and stage a years prior.
Freddy Fazbear evil not kids, family, Not for kids creepy animatronic 87 bad kids on nightmare kids get nightmares watching that it's so spooky October27 kids nightmare that make me movie what is a last time last time  Chuck E cheese frienddly kids education fun Ed attainment GOOD October 9-13 fun night Eatertainment
This is really interesting because I think a lot of this is area specific. Our local Chuck E Cheese brings in both kids and adults. And a lot of people think they have some of the best pizza in the area. We also are one of the few ones left that has the full band on stage. There's another Chuck E Cheese less than 2 hours away that only has Chuck on stage.
Hey! I have an amazing idea for a video! There's been a controversy lying around regarding the flavour of IRN-BRU (Scottish drink since 1909). Some say it's orange bubblegum, others say it's more akin to sprite or orangeade. As an avid drinker of the stuff, even I don't know how to describe it! Figuring out the flavour scientifically as well as perhaps the recipe to the soda would be IMMENSELY cool. Cheers, The Skelliz
I always wanted to work at Chuck-E-Cheese like my dad did. Except, I don't know if I can because probably by the time I get to work, the place will be different - if that wasn't a hoax.
At least we're gonna have human-like robots that we could dress up eventually
Can’t wait till a real Freddy pizzeria opens up. I’ve been seeing a lot of animatronics being built lately
I don't do well with horror. I've never really seen the appeal. But, I get that some people enjoy the adrenaline rush it can give, like riding a roller coaster. So if that's what it takes to keep a beloved childhood brand alive; I'll silently root for it from the corner and hope it comes back around to not horror so I can go back in.😅
I want to see CEC try their hand and making 1 or 2 test locations of a Family Friendly Horror/Thriller Experience to capitalize from the eatertainment digital horror games and videos
Being 26, I will always remember my birthday at my first Chuck E Cheese (I was in the single digits then); it had the singing animatronics on the stage(two actually), a disco dance floor(with a camera setup on the dance floor that broadcasted children on the dance floor all around the restaurant periodically), and sky tubes that stretched over the entire restaurant 😂😅 And Mat, we did in fact love those Dance floors😂 I was actually heartbroken when we moved to Georgia and the those here couldn’t even come close to the one in Orlando
12:47 NAH ID RATHER GET MEGUMIN
dude why has mat pat not made a theory on the Official Five Nights at Freddy's Cookbook there lot to see
Why did I laugh at "FNoF" 13:40
MatPat has answered the only question that I had about myself and the question was. Why do I love horror so much? MatPat if you are reading this. Thanks, mate (and also thanks for getting me addicted to FNaF bye)
I'm all for an irl fazbear frights
2:50 is that who i think it is
I'd argue Barcades have "Freeplay" as a reason for their success.
I think MatPat forgot that there are actual Rockstar animatronics from FNAF 6, otherwise he would've just  made the comparison saying that they both are called Rockstar animatronics.
I always thought Chuck E. Cheese was dying because of the lawsuits against the Entertainment-Cheese crime family?
They could start using actors in costumes instead of robots
14:27 FNAF took this idea & applied it with FNAF 3, since its plot was about Freddy’s resorting to horror, and maybe as well as FNAF Help Wanted.   I think Chuck E Cheese should open a fright attraction based on their animatronics like you said, since FNAF already proved this idea.
Thit episode makes me so, so sad. I loved chuckys as a kid :')
My fiancé was a consultant ( and an actor/ writer.. he was one of the characters in the videos in the mid 90s) for Chuck E Cheese. He told them back then to get rid of all of the robots but one and make that robot high quality since the quality of their robots was terrible and they were extremely expensive to repair and maintain ( his background was, of course, Disney).
8:01 I really need to know the location of this particular Barcade. The terminator two; Judgment Day cabinet at funspot broke down and I’m still trying to get the good ending.
I would totally spend my birthday at a horror version of Chuck E. Cheese. Animatronics dripping with guts and fidgeting erradically, arcade sections filled with zombie shooting games, low and/or flickering lights...
I've actually recently gotten back into playing pinball, and I can tell you that, yeah, playing on an actual table is VERY different from playing a virtual version from Steam (which nonetheless makes decent practice).  Contrast that to playing, say, Giant Flappy Bird as opposed to the mobile version. Some might say that the arcade version makes for great novelty but is ultimate inferior because the game was DESIGNED as a mobile game.
i live in miami florida what is this snow you speak of
The board members 😅
i honestly can't blame chuck e cheese or scott for not wanting to make a "real freddy fazbear's", because as insanely cool as it would be and how much money it would bring in, it takes just one person wanting to "recreate" the games for a real life tragedy to happen
What about Jasper?!
Hey Matpat, I have a challenge for you. I saw that in the video at 12:46 an anime figure from the comedy isekai anime Konosuba. Konosuba had a movie back in 2019 called Konosuba Legend of Crimson where at the end of the movie the explosion maniac of the group Megumin had decided to release her final explosion but when using saw that it was amped up by Kazuma the weakest member of their group and sort of love interest. In the final scene we see it from space and how big it was. Wanted to see if you could check how much tnt would be needed to make the same explosion. Bonus challenge if you could also see what it takes for MHA's explosion hero Bakugo to do the same level of explosion
30 seconds in the video and my 5 year old started crying, she loves the Chuck E Cheese animatronics. I don't really watch the news so I won't of knew until the next time we go out to Chuck.
Now we need a video on the science behind fnaf animatronic costumes and the franchise will hit all the theorist channnels
Food Theory Idea: do those fancy paper coffee filters that claim to enhance the taste, actually work?
Pretty sure the used pizza killed them
I would love so much if this show had a podcast version
MatPat, every arcade puts tickets on your digital card these days. Physical tickets ended years ago, well before COVID.
A rainforest cafe in my state shut down a while ago, so my family went to one a state over. Before we even got food we bought some things in the gift shop and at checkout my step brother was asked if he wanted to get some membership for savings. He said yes, and the employees looked shocked. Everyone in my family was losing it because we wondered when the last time someone ever got the membership was in this location (note: we went pre COVID)  Once we got our food the manager pulled up a chair and started talking to my parents and stepbrother. The whole thing was hilarious, we felt like celebrities for a day
Fnaf movie should use northridge mall in milwaukee, wi for a fnaf superplex movie. It already decrepid and ruined
Many things are responsible for the decline of Chuck E. Cheese. FNaF is not one of them.
Please do one about the origins of sriracha
It’s funny. Peter Piper Pizza (a west coast pizza chain) used to have a Purple Dinosaur as its mascot. And then it just poof, disappeared. One day it was there and I don’t remember when it left.
I deeply deeply dislike Matpat
Huh when you look at the direction the real life inspirations for fnaf went, security breach and the pizza Plex makes a lot more sense
im still a kid and want to watch the fnaf movie but i havent yet because i want to watch it with me my mom and my dad
Chucky cheese lore sounds like fnaf
3:47 bro got so young he stopped existing
If you can find a game for $50, tell me where I can find it.
I actually think it would be really cool if Chuck E Cheese came up with their own non fnaf related scary restaurant. Maybe with a meow wolf style story that you can figure out by looking around.
When I first went to Chuck E. Cheese, I was scared of the robots because I had just learned about Fnaf.
You're also forgetting "Cheez E. Caesar's" as another animatronic Eat-ertainment place.  so there's also that to think about.  You can't just use showbiz and chucky.  there's a 3rd big player in this story.  Or rather....There WAS a 3rd player.... Worth looking into.
Dude matpat, you could have cracked a joke with Rockstar Chuck E Cheese, there’s literally ROCKSTAR animatronics in FNAF6!
I think if CEC DID partner with FNAF to make Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy, it would boost sales exponentially. If CEC was the ONLY place a person could see real life versions of the FNAF animatronics, people would be flooding the place.
I feeli like the pizzaplex is gonna happen, just named a lil diff, like cheeza-plex
Animatronics are expensive to maintain. If it was profitable, we would see more places, but it isn't.
Did Matpat forget there’s actually Rockstar versions of the Fazbear gang?
One problem, Scott Cawthin said he wouldn’t make Animatronics based off of FNAF because he Is scared that people will recreate FNAF by killing and stuffing kids in suits
Weird editing choice using glamrock freddy about 4 mins in when theres an ACTUAL rockstar freddy animatronic in fnaf6 Other than that, great video as always!
Given the popularity of the pop up fnaf bar that happened for the movie i think matpat has the right idea
I feel like Chuck E Cheese could try leaning into the creepy animatronics stuff. Both of my kids would probably be more likely to want to go, and were genuinely disappointed when I told them none of the Chuck E Cheese locations near us have the animatronics anymore. They are interested in this *because* of FNAF.
8:51 this felt like a cry for help, for a game suggestion if you dont mind violence then shadow of war if you do mind it then well i guess mincraft?
Son: Mom can we have FNAF! Mom: We have FNAF at home FNAF at home: FNOF
Here's the other thing though. . .did any kid actually CARE about the animatronics? I'm in my early 30s now. . .and remember seeing them as a kid. . .and not only finding them creepy. . .but frankly, paying little to no attention to them the few times I went. >.> Admittedly I was the kid trying to figure out how to consistently dunk Skiball.
You should look up a song called "Pest Control" By a band called The Radioactive Chicken Heads. Yes, that is who you think it is in the video.
Question :can u see ur reflection in a actual bubble ?
Why is this on food theory?
What? NO! They shouldn't get rid of the animatronics, make modern ones and work with FNAF to retheme the restaurant! An IRL Freddy Fazbear's, made like Meow Wolf mayby, would be great!
What about Jasper tee joules? He was my favorite character.
The grimmace shake was how i found out i was lactose intolerant, sadly. It was good tho
I've been working at CEC for nearly a year, and I honestly really like the pizza.
mat mat mat please  Its charles entertainment cheese the third  The other one died in the war
9:17 IS THAT PAMELA VOORHEES SWEATER?!???
I like how everybody blames FnaF for Chuck E. Cheese's downfall but the truth is it's their own fault. CEC entertainment began focusing less on quality and growth and more on making money no matter how unethical and ridiculous. They got lazy, they got careless they cut so many costs that they cut out the most important thing of all, the magic. Chuck E. Cheese use to have a motto "Make Magic, Without it were just another Pizza Place" Nolan Bushnell is probably crying himself to sleep knowing that the empire he created has been reduced to an absolute joke.
Game theory and all the spin off channels sre just FNAF theory channels lol
There goes MatPat again, giving out good business advice for free...
I bet my asscheeks its Scott Cawthon
How did Casa Bonita not merit a mention here?
As someone who has taken kids to CeC over the years this isn't surprising.  They are scaled down to one well before FNAF was made.  Moving to characters on screens.    It's makes more sense economically and practically.  Allowing them to update content easier.  Plus my spouse and I go on dates to CeC.  It's a cheap arcade and then we do something else in the mall afterwards.
You know, in theory the idea of a FNAF restaurant would be awesome! However, I doubt that will happen because I believe Scott even said himself that he won’t ever make a real FNAF restaurant due to the fact that there would likely be some sicko out there who would try to make the story real.
I agree, CEC should 100% lean into the horror element
As a former employee 2x (as a teen/adult 1st assist manager) the company has been trying to do this for years!!!! In Ohio there use to be several location. Now they barely exist (4 left). The company has been in decline for decades. Over priced and just not popular. They even tried to start serving alcohol (which was a horrible idea and made working there harder). 1 of the locations I worked at, had to have sheriff detail. Yikes. That place was horrible!!!
12:46 MEGUMIN
soooo,  when's scot buying Chuk?
I'd rather buy a million fortnite emotes than a new car
I feel like as a kid the animatronics were only ever used once in a blue moon. Almost every time I ever went there the entire section with the animatronics was closed. Us kids didn't really care. We just wanted to play the arcade games and gamble our tokens away. Even without an animatronics show, if they just partnered with fnaf for some branding crossover, that would be enough for kids to be interested. Name some arcade games after fnaf characters and kids would be all over it.
wait a second. i have been to several Hard Rock Cafes through the years and NEVER, not ONCE have i ever been to one where Live music was a thing. they were just regular restaurants but with music history and photos of the staff with famous musicians that have visited and eaten at their location
It's an interesting idea but the whole reason that Scott never wanted a restaurant to be made is because he had a feeling that someone IRL would want to imitate the murders of William Afton
"mom can we have fnaf" "we have fnaf at Chuck E Cheese" fnof:
Game theory merch is now the equivalent of splatoon gear, just look at them, listen to their names, can’t wait to eventually get some quick respawn in the wardrobe, maybe some ninja squid…
Yep chuck e cheese needs to basically pull a fnaf 3
They're going to switch to Toy character designs for the ipcoming second movie
Chuck e cheese should rebrand to fnaf
The only thing stopping Scott from making a real world Fazbear Pizzeria is his fear that someone will copy what William did to the 5 kids.
Well another reason Chuck E. Cheese’s might be hesitant to lean into the Fnaf stuff is so the really sick people don’t try to “recreate” the events in real life
My nephew had a birthday party at Chuck E Cheese over the summer before the movie released. No animatronics. Just a light up dance floor for the kids. Every so often, a guy in the mouse suit would come out and interact with the kids.
Perfect, I was just about to eat pizza when I saw this video showed up
I think mat is on to something here. I'm from the UK. We've never had anything comparable to chuck e cheese, so there's 0 nostalgia value for me. And yet in recent years I've watched so much content about it, just because of FNAF.
Old school ftw
what the actual
Also, recycled pizza
I would pay $$$ for a Chuck-FNAF-Cheese dinner...
Matpat literally spying on me... I was talking about dave and busters... like "I dont wanna play a 4 foot tall fruit ninja, i had it on mobile"...
Congrats on 5mil!
what came first the wonky pizza's or the fnaf  MUSIC MAN
It’s funny, I was JUST thinking about Barcades as he was talking about the decline of Chuck E Cheese. I see more of them everywhere these days – it feels like the perfect blend for millennials on a night out – drinks and casual games. And tbh I have enjoyed going to the various ones around me.
You know what I think? I think that Chuck E Cheese should seek a partnership with FNAF and turn Chuck e Cheese into Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. It's gonna sell, they don't have to come up with ideas for designs or source material and it will make their business relevant. Animatronics are dead, it's all about VTuber's and holograms, the digital world, the only place where animatronics are still relevant now is in the world of horror, and at the top of that is FNAF. It probably won't happen, but at this point FNAF is so big that the demand is definitely there, and making Freddy Fabear's Pizza into a real chain might just save their wallets.
MatPat will start recommending all failing brands combine with FNAF. FNAF all the things! I don't have a problem! YOU HAVE A PROBLEM!!!!
Dave and Busters might have started similar to barcades but in the 2010s pivoted to be more of an adult chuck e cheese to appeal to families. Scaling back the arcade games in favor of more and more games of chance to win tickets to redeem for prizes.  Adults who control the money aren't interested in being liquored up to be marketed down to. One thing about Barcades though is they are catering to a nostalgia crowd. In a generation or two I doubt barcades will still be as profitable as they are today.
its all fun and games until someone tries to recreate the bite of 87
I grew up with showbiz and it terrified me. Lol.
Nah toy chica should not be real we have some real creeps on this planet
I'm not interested in any FNAF content but I cant say no to Chuck
did bendy made micky uncool             long answer short no we just grow out of it
I actually really don't like barcades, and kind of don't get their popularity; I mean sticking a bar right next to an arcade is an awesome idea, but sticking them in the same building just makes them both worse; Less arcade than you could have, along side a completely overstimulating bar. Make the businesses neighbors, and you've fixed both problems.
Hey btw my son told me today that one of his classmates SAW the fnaf movie soo yeah Chuckie better get scary
They should have kept them to give Fnaf vibes.
Hi😊
It'd be fun if they did lean into the horror thing but went a different but similar direction with their own characters. For example, they could have the old Chuck e cheese come back in his animatronic glory and be super creepy and say stuff like "I'm back Chuck, you tried to bury me, but I'm back. You can't bury the past if the past is ME" or something Im not a writer but i think it'd be a very fun way of going the horror route and bringing back and reusing older assets that probably haven't been thought of in years. Could even dirty them up a bit make it look like those old animatronics crawled out of the earth or like out of a warehouse or something. Make it seem like the new Chuck tried to get rid of the previous Chuck or something ya know Fun stuff
Matpat don't give them ideas they are gona hide lore in Chuck E Cheese.
THANK YOU MATPAT! IVE BEEN WAITING ON THIS ONE FOR SUCH A LONG TIME! YEEEEEES!
No it wasn't somebody said that scott cawthorns games were too scary so he made fnaf actually check your facts next time mate. it's no surprise so many people hate you you can't get your facts right
No   Just no    DO NOT MAKE CHUCK E CHEESE INTO FNAF... Thats just asking for an unhinged person to ruin this for everyone and hurt kids in the process....   I wish we lived in a world where this would be okay and a wonderful time.... But we dont...
Æ
This harkens back to my idea of making a combination Gym and Arcade. I would love to get fit, but gyms are boring at best and painful at worst, and I can't motivate myself to go. If something else could lure me there and keep my attention while I am working out, then perhaps I would be more successful. Plus if anyone remembers back to when DDR came out, I specifically remember some of my friends getting big into that and then getting REALLY fit because of it.
You know what. People of my generation are also having less kids. So while I loved Chuck E Cheese as a kid I don't have a kid to take there myself for them to have fun and that would also hurt their sales. Especially when a ton of younger people that were sales grow up and don't have kids to take there to keep the sales going.
That sucks I guess maybe they're having a decline in popularity and think it might be due to the animatronics. Though honestly there have always been kids that were scared of them. My sister was climbing up my aunt to try and get away from Chuck E when we were kids. Regardless I think they should keep them just make them look more cartoony and friendly looking. I loved the place as a kid and i'm sure plenty of other kids still do and part of that would be due to the characters. Removing them seems like a bad step to me but if it works it works
Barcade is actually a trademarked name like Kleenex
We get the point, you had a scene in the garbage fnaf movie, why keep milking this.
Next plaza hut what are chips, chicken    nuggets and small box's     ,
As a teen who had lived in clarksville (I dont anymore) we had a Chucky cheese that used to have the animatronics and a hudge play place but i have seen them get rid of both and the dance floor isnt even that impressive so they are killing business
I’ve been wanting to go to a barcade. There’s a few around where I live. Can’t say I know when the craze started. But, I imagine it’s a hit because of the drinks, and the retro arcade games. It’s not just older adults that like old games, some younger generations, like me, LOVE the charm of classic arcade machines. Honestly, I see Dave and Busters outliving Chuck E Cheese. D&B is fun for families, and can be a “Chuck E Cheese for adults” as well. The food’s pretty good too.
It'd be quite a "killer" deal to have FNAF and Chuckie Cheese work together. It'd give the animatronics "life" in real life to have a horror experience with Freddy and the gang in front of us rather than behind our screens. Like man! People be ready for the spooks and turn up like Fry from Futurama.
The Chuck E Cheese in my city had a disco-ish dance-floor months, I mean like before my most-recent ex and I were even officially dating, ago. So that the announcement would be made only some weeks ago, feels weird.
This is just so cool. Even as a 22 year old I love the theories, man!
When people said fans killed chuck-e-cheeseI was genuinely so confused, the only reason anyone knows about chuck-e-cheese is because of fans
The main problem is Scott would never do it. He has allowed CEC to skirt his IP, but if they try to make it horror themed, he'll sue them instantly. Scott has said multiple times he would never make a irl FNaF attraction, cause he does not want to give wannabe William aftons a opportunity
As someone who works at Chuck e cheese. We very rarely get any questions about FNAF. My store has had the band gone for at least 2 years. And a person gets In the chucke suit and is able to interact with the kids which is why they are moving from a band playing. To an interactive thing for the kids.
Frig... I think I took the kids to a barcade this week 😂 but in our defense... They didn't complain, especially when we were paying 5$ for a prime and the kids were enjoying old school Sonic and Mario games. They also didn't scream and holler more than your normal good kid just playing a video game. I dunno lol I wanna go back though.
13:00 IVE BEEN SAYING THIS SINCE CHUCKY ENTERTAINMENT CHEESE ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WERE GETTING RID OF THEIR ANIMATRONICS!!! The smartest business move for CEC right now is to partner with FNAF because their is a legitimate target audience to be had by making a place where people can enjoy the experience of fnaf!
film theory idea: how long would the the bad guys ACTUALLY be in jail/what are the fines they would have to pay or any other punishment they'd have to endure
Chunk-E-Sneezes where a kid can be a snot!
the real reason they merged is due to the showbiz pizza character owner. showbiz bought chuck e cheese and for 5 years they stayed separate until a disagreement with aaron and showbiz that aaron took away the characters, and beer and wine have been around since their early days
Dave and busters did buy main event
There are Rockstar animatronics in FNAF6
Sigma
Simple answer : yes
9:07 There were literally northern lights over me while I bought the blue sweater from the new collection, haha. I live in Norway, so a winter collection called northern lights is perfect! I bought it 4 minutes after the collection was available to pre order (and ordered a couple sizes bigger so it could be extra cozy), and after paying for it, my friend yelled to come look at the northern lights. It was like a sign that I did the right thing
This is just the FNaF lore all over
Who remembers the movie _The Country Bears_ ? ah, good times.
8:35 I love those cocktail clubs with arcades, never seen a bar with an arcade though!
7:03 i am so sorry but everytime i see that png of the prize corner i just think of dayshift at freddys 2

8:50 The GTA VI producers have mentioned that they are looking into a by the hour video game experience, because they sell this game for 50 to 60 and you get HUNDREDS, even a THOUSAND hours of entertainment, and they want to market on it
The issue underpinning the issue described in this video is that revitalizing an organization is *hard.* It requires making big changes, and big changes are risky because no matter what, some of your existing audience will be offended and there are no guarantees that you'll attract the new one you're courting. Plus, if the risk fails, the leaders who took the risk will be forever tainted with the blame, even though it may have been the best chance the organization had at revitalizing. It's always easier to die a slow death by staying your current course than it is to gamble between a new life and a fast death.
I like the pizza :<
The theory symbol has become a Simon says game.
18t
They were already taking animatronics out of their stores literal years ago
Wait, what similar rat franchise did you mean at the end?
I’ve been saying for years that Chuck E Cheese needs to make a deal with FNAF and rebrand to give us real Freddy’s restaurants
What's next an film theory and game theory on sotres killing sotres. Those iaeds came to me for this resaon see where I live we lost an Walmart an few more stores becuase as the sotry goes thier cash cow was Blockbuster Video.  My loacl mall is deing since the sotry goes that Gamestop was it's cash cow.
8:18 alcohol, in victory you deserve it, but in defeat, you NEED it.
wish theorywear was afforadble for 3rd world countries because the clothes are so amazing.
We need some drummer theory
any one know what the beat he use is called?
I missed my chance to watch the FNAF movie sadly 😢😢😢😢😢
2:34 WHAT IS WITH THIS NOISE?! The background music is so annoying it's hard to watch the episode
Doesn’t Chuck E Cheese only exist because of something at Disney World?
Is it out of reach to think that Chuck E. Cheese retiring the band and then soon after we'll see Scott Cawthon's name as the brand-new owner thus replacing Chuck E. Cheese's band with Bonnie, Chica, Foxy, and Freddy?
That’s just a theory
Personally I think FNAF boosted attention of Chuck E. Cheese by making people aware of it; Covid and a bland marketing redesign killed Chuck E. Cheese. A lot of my friends grew up on it or learned more thanks to FNAF, if not already having known beforehand. I love both FNAF and CEC so I'll always have my memories of the latter.
My friend works there and apparently FNAF is the reason (at least according to her manager)
...why did I click on something about FNAF at three in the morning?
If they really merge with fnaf, im the one who gonna recreate the game "events"
hi
Food theory idea 💡: how long could you survive in a fast food place off only the food they have in it
Imagine if scott bought chuck e cheese because they bankrupt, just like how matpat theorized emily bought fredbear because bankrupt, and the owner become a co-owner and you know the rest
2:55 this whole bit here sounds like the personality of William Afton and Henry Emily and their life lol fnaf lore
WOAH! Since when the subscribe button actually did that?!
What about the rockstars in fnaf6
Congrats For 5Mil subs
bro imagine Chuck E Cheese actually merge with the FNaF brand... just like what happened to mcdonalds, IT WOULD BE COOL! They would use the animatronics in the FNaF movie!!!
15:45 I can't remember that rat name but it looks so familiar. Does anyone know the rat's name?
OMG FNAC reference?!?!?!?!
The fazbear is unstoppable.
But i go to chucky cheese for the pizza
I think the movie will be inspired from  FNAF 2 game
And the movie is inspired from The Silver eyes book not from FNAF 1 game
FNAF always fits in autumn
Soon as I saw this I thought of anything fnaf would help. It’s to popular. Unless they made a horror restaurant to compete with chuck , it’s not taking away from them. Life basically killed chuck’s business. Families barely spend time together as they did before. Life’s to busy and expensive now.
would fly to America for a irl fnaf experience
FNOF GAVE ME A LAUGH😂😂😂
literally went to a barcade last night , it was great and i will be going back and bringing friends
“We’re not just making merch anymore… “ no, MatPat. You’re not.   I went on a minor tirade in the comments for one of the many (TOO MANY) Simon Whistler channels recently, and the point was that it’s kinda hard to take you “successful YouTubers” seriously because the things that make you FINANCIALLY successful are analyzing your viewers’ data and figuring out which corporate sponsors work best for you, and/or would work best as the commercials we get in the middle of your vids.  Also- the plug for your own branded merch in the middle of the video wouldn’t be so bad, if I didn’t know that you sold the “brand” to some media company and now you, MatPat, are just the host/merch salesman who collects some royalties on the side.   I’m not trying to hate on you my dude, I’ve been a fan since literally day one… but as you are looking out for your family and trying to secure your financial future, please try and consider not turning your “network” of shows into just another avenue for Google and Ridge to sell ad space. Smooches.
wait dident chuckez sut dawn
I guess a few things: 1. Scott would probably never pair up only because he literally had said (since he could've if he wanted too kept that pizzeria  he used in the film open and make it a restaurant that actually was working and functional) but he said he didn't want the events of fnaf to actually happen. not in the sense of obviously haunted animatronics but he didn't want the events of someone actually killing kids to take place which is why he said he'd never open a restaurant and stick to just video games and movies. I will say, as paranoid as I can be, his is far greater lol. I'd open it up since I know that's what people want. But he has a point seeing how there are twisted people out there  2. This is why they shouldn't do just lights, if they really wanted to cheaply do things, easy, not just what Disney or Universal does (Even though Disney's breaks down a lot more then Universal does lol), Holograms in general. It's possible we see them in broad daylight. If you can get them to have sensors and speakers that picked up what the kid is saying to the mascot and the mascot through random generated words, can function and talk back entirely without glitching etc and him looking like the rockstar Chuckie, they'd be back in business. And to save even more costs they could go and put solar panneling on top of their stores if they wanted too, it's probably fair less expensive to change an image that's a 3D model on a program and fix a few lights that would probably not dysfunction as often rather than an old animatronic. Gotta get into that digital age. The only thing that would break the immersion is if a strong storm knocked out the power but even then it's called "backup generators." which most restaurants use in cases of emergencies. 4.Yes give the kids what they want the problem is not every parent is going to bring their kids there for a horror attraction. As parents get older or maybe they have a mom or dad that just isn't into horror at all, they wont' be stepping foot in there UNLESS a friend had a parent that liked it. Doesn't matter what gen you're in, some people just can't handle the actual horror aspect. Like I'm 29, I went to see the FNAF movie, it wasn't scary to me more laughable then anything but my mum refused to step in. But if you had a place dedicated like a huanted house, I ain't stepping in. Like how my niece likes to go to the huanted house we bring her but with her friend but she's old enough to be left alone. Kids who are 8 or so can't be without their parents. So you're only hitting again one demographic which is bad.   You really want a good fix?  1. Do more modern games and replace the animatronics with Holograms instead 2. because holograms are cheaper, pay entry can become in time cheaper making it cheaper to go in. 3. have toys that are actually worth something  4. the idea of lights isn't a bad idea, but getting rid of all character's are. 6. Have holograms that also move around outside of the stage and be interactive that will encourage more people to want to be apart of it seeing how sadly the US doesn't utilize too much of the holographic technology like Japan or other places do. If we did we'd have a cheaper time. Problem I see is just finding and hiring someone who knows what they're doing seeing how the US isn't the highest of educational systems anymore. Japan and Sweden are seeing how Sweden was the one to come up with holograms first and Japan jumped to it as well. They'd have to hire people probably out of country in that field or just someone in the US who learned and tried to get a job. Seeing how a lot of Disney's yes they work, but they still malfunction because some are just placed on animatronic faces....it's not fully holographic. I"m talking like Miku Hatsune Holograms on stage which is possible since it's just lights reflecting. And with sensors being added to holograms you can both talk and the hologram can "sense" where your hand is which is why the holographic keyboard is available. Even just going fully digital for an experience. At least with that you also can get gen Z and alpha's attention. Bringing truly imagination to life.  and I call also bs on the whole they don't want expensive items and just going places those people who do that are the "prank" channels wanting to cause problems in other countries or places.  but they still flex what they have. they still want to be rich and famous. they still want items. they don't deserve it mind you for what they've been doing and making Japan go up in arms with these people being very disrespectful. but don't let them fool you they're very happy with their millions of different items jewelry etc.  just the probelm is "outdated" no one wants to see an animatronic on stage anymore And kids today who learn of this technology of holograms and better things out there are going to want to see more of that instead. They don't want "hunks of junk"  and only catering to one demographic which is the horror kids/teens and some adults you're not gonna grab everyone cause not every parent is gonna want to go to a haunted pizzeria. Not everyone can handle horror. and it's no fair either to those who have actual heart conditions either so they don't even get a good time these days...a lot of people who suffer through heart conditions aren't allowed to do a lot of things these days and excluding them out I feel bad for them since I too have tachycardia and it sucks. I can't go there or i risk an actual problem fnaf wasn't scary but being more immerged in it now you're only grabbing some people to still go.  I say just go full digital like the security breach pizzeria with holograms bright lights and updating themselves.
I didn’t know Chuck E Cheese was still around.
Yas venom game
i would fly from europe to america just to go to a fnaf themed restaurant istg
now i want eat- eat- urrr eat-free
But did Scott cofen say that he would think someone would reacraty the games
I worked for Chuck E. Cheese about 2 years ago and it’s been an ongoing thing that they’ve been removing animatronics from several restaurants. Almost a year and a half ago it was confirmed that they were actually removing them from EVERY restaurant
*Fake motive:* I wanna make a theory on why CEC is losing money. *True motive: I wanna go to an actual Freddy Fazbear’s pizzeria.*
Hello there
I am here for matpat’s 818 call out, I live down the street from that CEC
They should just not fix the animatronics it'll be way scarier then
Bro I would more than willingly take my kids to Chuck E Cheese if they leaned into a more fnaf theme.
Just saying while it may be more expensive in most cases the experience is better. An actual physical dinosaur popping out on a ride is so much better than a 2d one getting a little close to the screen
Audience members between the ages of 13-24  30 year old me in the audience: 🤡
This is when fnaf becomes a real thing
Bringing Matpat into the set was a bold and great move by the film because Matpat is the one duking out at anyone who is trying to jump into FNAF's bandwagon. For free too
7:05 it's the bacround for the prize corner on dayshift at Freddy 2
@9:46 ????????
Syd has been free,Ed and we had our cake too my fory furd friend
You are correct about how kids not even afraid about horror now there's day. If anything Zoomers would just laugh and talks about them casually. The age where kids scream is pretty dead by now.  Chunky Cheese do NOT need to be safe at all! If anything the Five Night at Fredy is just normal for zoomers now.  I literally listen to my 6 years old brother about the jumscare and even theory...  Kids built different nowadays. Don't be safe! Go wild as long as its not morally wrong to make kids see them. Like crime or anything.
What!? I wanna see middle aged, balding, beer gut, cigar smoking chucky!!!!!
Ummm didn't Disney confirm that they are no longer going to use projected faces and going forward are going to go back to full animatronics due to projected faces ruining emersion? I think that was confirmed after they built the Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway in Disneyland California. Perfect example of them moving away from projected faces is the Frozen ride originally built in Disney World vs the new one they built in Hong Kong Disney. Elsa was build without a projected face at Hong Kong. I could be wrong though with Disney no longer using projected faces.
Thise things have been terrifying children since long before the invention of the smartphone.
Does salt actuallt make water boil faster or is that a myth
A FNAF Video on Game Theory, Food Theory, Film Theory and GTLIVE. You truly can’t escape him. Now we just need a Style Theory video on Mr Fazbear.
I’d gone to Chuck E Cheese when I was a kid in the 2000s when the animatronics were still used, and the mascots animated character designs were different from what they are now. Funny enough, it seems more kids know about Freddy Fazbear than the real pizza chain it was inspired by: Chuck E Cheese.
Please make this theoryware a yearly tradition so in a few years time when I’m not broke (hopefully) I can get some.
Five Night At Chuck E Cheese
Another day, more misinformation from mat. cec announced that it will removed its animatronics in 2015 at the earliest. And the reason they did it was because interest in the animatronics was dwindling. Let’s not spread misinformation in the thumbnail..
@13:05 sounds exactly right
I like how the camera clips thru the police tape here at 0:50
Chuck E Cheese should hire some furries
what is the other franchise with a rat lurking around in the shadows
Make chuck E cheese restaurants like fnaf three and have the animatronics serve you pizza
Ok but just imagine how much lore matpat would get if they made in person Fnaf locations
I was creeped out by Chuck E Cheese's animatronics as a kid before FNAF came out.  It is not unreasonable that it upset children who don't know what FNAF is.
theres a bowling alley/ arcade that just opened in my mall and its the best of both version of both worlds
I actually had a recent idea that Chuck E Cheese could do their normal thing during the day, then convert just before sunset to a FNAF style attraction
Honestly I would love to go to Chucky for the first time in my life just be scared 😂
Bit of an aside here but does anyone else remember Bear Right in Concord NH in the 1980s and 1990s? The best part was the giant 3 story tree in the center of the building where an animatronic owl would pop out of various doors to announce the times for the next bear music review. There were also arcades and several restaurants.
Yeah let’s be honest, the fact that arcades are so incredibly overpriced for what it is, I’m not going to go somewhere to pay 2$ to play a game one singular time, why waste the money for a game that’s not even that fun?
I always thought of the team as Chuck E Cheese so I don't blame others thinking the same
nah cause someone will try recreate the lore if ya know what i mean
I actually do work at a Chuck E Cheese with no animatronics but a costume and a dance floor. You’d be surprised how many children absolutely love that floor even though it’s kinda dumb. The only problem is that the suit gets hot
We all know that an official fnaf location/restaurant that people can visit will NEVER open because Scott himself said he didn’t want to. He didn’t want ppl to try and recreate the incident of the murders bc some people are crazy enough to do that.
I’m 22 and I still love Chuck E. Cheese Pizza
"Young ppl want to experience horror" Yup can confirm 😂
Whilst that would just be incredible...   I think scott was right about there always being that... ya know... peraon who would try to "recreate" the fnaf events. So yeah. I dont know what to think about that actually happening.
WAS THAT THE BITE OF '87!?
Mat pat can you do star vs the forse of evil
Five Nights At Chucks 3: Chuckys Freight
See, with Chuck getting younger as time passes, clearly he was just uncreated
A great example that American media franchises can learn is from Japan popup manga/anime cafe. Periodically, or close to an anniversary/ new material release, manga/anime titles would reach out to cafes for a day/week timed. The cafe would decorated, have foods/drinks inspired by that title, plus selling merch. It's a great marketing strategy, and like a reminder for fans to reminicind "remember how happy this series made u"
Chuck E Cheese has no clue how much I would love to walk into a FNAF and take my littles. They better get on it!!!
Rockstar Freddy exists
From Houston: Its been like this for awhile for us, is this not already a thing for awhile.
Hey Matpat I was going to get the Aurora blazer but does it come with the pants in the picture? Because it doesn't ask pants size just shirt size also didn't see the pants listed separately
So do fazbear frights irl
I remember going to chuck e cheese with my uncle as a kid. He worked with all sorts of technology so we always stayed after the place closed while he talked to the staff about the robots, lights, and sound system. I remember being right there on the stage and looking at the animatronics up close, and even being able to look at the ways they hid some of the animatronics that weren't working without removing them from the stage altogether.   It is one of my favorite memories and I am truly saddened by the fact that they are getting rid of the animatronics
I agree with mat pat they should merge with fnaf we can finally have Freddy fazbears  pizza and we can have are animatronics that we loved since childhood 😊😊❤
While Fnaf could be what saves Chuck E Cheese, I don't think Scott Coffin would do a crossover with Chuck E Cheese with recreating the fnaf restaurant in fear of copycat killers. I do however agree that Chuck E Cheese has a huge marketing problem. So I would suggest that Chuckie does go into an original horror animintronic theme instead of using the fnaf IP
Feels like everythings getting more expensive everyday and yet things like park experiences, concerts, services and more are just getting worse and worse.  Its kinda impressive how things need more money now and yet they cant even provide a fraction of the inmersion they used to back in 90s or early 2000s. 😕
nah I do miss the chuck e cheese animatronics I liked them as a kid
I believe a small partnership between Chuck E. Cheese and FNAF will immortalize both franchises. I think since Scott doesn't want to make an actual FNAF restaurant or anything i think they both can do a seasonal thing where every Halloween Chuck E. Cheese gets a visit from their old band mates or cousins idk they can make a unique and separate story that will appeal to both kids and parents alike. Heck they can eve have tgeir own little show with lore. And that way its only during October that Chuck E. Cheese becomes truly spooky or scary. I think something along these lines will and can save them but otherwise sadly the decline will continue.
As a brit i had literally no idea what chucky cheese was till this video. So cheers matt.
I was going in for the pizza 😔
Okay, but NOBODY was dealing with the full animatronic band, especially Moon, Pizza Cam and Munch Jr. Those guys were never cared enough about to repair, so that really doesnt matter. Also, even then, most places didnt have all the band anyway, theybusually just had a Studio C set up, either a 32 movement or a 16 movement, so it would only be 1 animatronic really needed to maintain for most locations. Plus, I have heard from employees that the darn dancefloor breaks down at least once a wesk anyway, so they are still making idiotic financial decisions, not that THATS a surprise since they axe the bots rather than sell them minus the cosmetics to collectors. Those endos go for like 3 grand a pop when destroyed on Ebay. I know in tact ones that have sold for 10 grand. We CEC fans are willing to pay and arm and a leg for these guys to be preserved, and CEC is just literally destroying and throwing them away, along with OLD WALL ART which we fans ALSO buy, usually for a couple hundred dollars. They are throwijg away free money that could help with their debt and they wonder why the fans arent happy.  REMEMBER FOLKS! Dumpster dive near your local CEC if it is legal and save what you can find when they get the dreaded 2.0 updates, because we fans WILL buy that stuff right up from ya.
Actually 🤓  they were already doing it before the movie was coming out due to money
I feel like they could've gotten around this if they really didn't want animatronics but still wanted something like what they had -- maybe those new fangled holograms or something? It's not like anyone's going to be touching them anyway and since they're digitized you could make them even more magical than before
Best way to get cheap animatronics with low maintainence is to stuff kids inside!!!
There’s no way that FNAF and chuck .E cheese would merge I mean for FNAF they allready said there will be no acual place made for fear of certain things being recreated
I know is really weird but, how many McDonald's cheese burgers would it take to crush a cubic centimeter concrete cube
Me being an employee at the billings CEC I completely agree with this! Our characters here in billings are 1 of the last 5 original 3 stage sets and no one i work with including the managers, want the characters gone. So im all for this. We as the fan base just need to step up and save the animatronics we all know and love!
Chuck e cheese was hit hard WELL before the pandemic lol. Still a great theory!
Change Chucky cheese pizza to Freddy fazbares pizza!😂
I do think a Fnaf style of glamrock style escape room and arcade style Dave and busters would make a lot of money
I enjoyed your cameo in FNAF 😂
You know Bullwinkle's is basically the exact same thing as Chuck-E-Cheese except it's a little better and they have animatronics as well except they're like Bullwinkle and Rocky and based off the Bullwinkle show I wonder if they'll retire their animatronics😢😢😢  PS I hope you turned down the heating in your house and didn't turn it off cuz if you turn it off if it gets too cold the pipes will freeze and burst
This is like McDonald’s taking away the red and yellow theme and play place
Ngl the grimes shake was so dumb
Matpat was literally going there for the pizza during the pandemic
I want that Megumin
And this is where we get into the Fnaf episode where they rebranded Freddy's Pizzeria as a horror themed venue :p
Yayyyyy more fnaf episodes lol
if this actually happens it would probably be the most funny and ironic thing to ever happen
Scott revealed that he was never going to open a fnaf restaurant with animatronics bc there would be someone who should try to replicate the events of the lore
Day #3 of asking matpat to make a theory about thneedvile being a cult
So you're saying they should make the Fazbear's Fright: The Horror Attraction from FNAF 3 ?
This feels too much like a Fnaf coincidence. Is Nolan Bushnell in a Chuck E. Cheese suit somewhere?
The FNAF movie was terrible. It was a B movie plot which did not hit. I should clarrify a few things. A am thirty nine so the inspiration behind FNAF I got to experience first hand in the golden age of arcades with games like The Simpsons, X-Men, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and House of the Dead. I used to absolutely love Chucky E. Cheese and horror. Over time Chuck E. Cheese was no longer fun. It was bearable only getting worse the older I got. Horror on the other hand went from one of the main movie genres I watched around that time to something I watch on occasion. I have barely watched a half a dozen horror movies in the last two months. I never had a connection to the FNAF series because it was not my thing. The series seems to be made for gamers who have less time on their hands. Which is an entire market in and of itself for gamers. Resident Evil 7 was absolutely worth purchasing, just a solid game. Control on the other hand was the last game in the horror genre which caused me to lose faith in the horror genre.
Oh... this explains so much. *SO THAT'S WAY I HAVE THAT WEIRD HIPPO FETISH!!"*
I think the reason chuck e cheese never fully embraced the horror or has never done a collab with fnaf is due to a point that scott himself once stated. He basically said its cool in concept but as much as the fan base is fun somebody will take it to far and may actually hurt some kids in an attempt to reflect the games in a sick way. 14:28
In my 20s when I first went to Dave and Busters, I was genuinely shocked kids were allowed in
After being a technical Manager at chuck e cheese here in NC, the official reason they always gave internal people was that animatronic parts are just hard to get, very expensive, and have a huge lead time
My 16 year old niece swears that she and her friends would go broke if Chuck E Cheese had teen and up restricted haunted/FNAF nights.  That's a LOT of disposable income they're ignoring.
Um....I work there.... I asked my boss, and everyone in management.  We're literally only modernizing the brand. Fnaf has nothing to do with ANYTHING.
Im so tired fnaf theories, please make better theory videos.
the last time someone reused old tech for a new form of entertainment afton came back AGAIN
One of my favorite arcades is Cidercade here in the Dallas-Fort Worth. Was there just last night and it’s 12 dollars to get in and all the games are free to play. If you want to drink they have their ciders. If you don’t like drinking that’s fine too. In the afternoon they are family friendly but after 8:00 it’s 21+ only so it’s just perfect for adults after a long work day or time to enjoy the weekend so MatPat is 100% right on that point
It invaded film theory now it invaded food theory
Where do I get the dress pants as well? I want to get the blazer but won't if I can't get the pants or at least be sure that I'll be able to get the pants later.
🤦🏻‍♂️
Still waiting for the episode for the fnaf cookbook
Barcades are on the rise because -tokens are typically cheaper compared to Dave and Buster’s games (12/$5 with 1 token average a game at my local vs. $20 for 75 credits at 5-12 credits a games) -drinks are cheaper by a landslide (outside of happy hours, drinks at Dave and Busters are about $15/each vs $8/each average at my local) -entertainment is better (games are fun and all, but there’s nothing like watching drunk karaoke)  Beyond the fact the fact price is cheaper, the experience is typically better and results in more revenue for the bar in the form of tips or token sales.
I worked at Chuck E. Cheese for 4 years (that was 2017-2021) and they have been taking out the animatronics for a while now
Can everyone like stop patronising chuck e cheese
I would’ve bought the new theory wear … buuuuuuut I live in Singapore but in three years I will get it
Matt pat I hate to tell you you’re wrong but you said millennials for the ages of 13-24 it’s actually Gen Z I should know as I am 22 and a gen z who watched the fnaf movie thanks to your theory videos.
The whole reason Chuck E. Cheese's in Northridge CA is keeping their animatronics, is because of my best friend. He started a petition to save the animatronics 2 years ago. (Before the movie even came out) Chuck E. Cheese has been removing the stages for years. The movie had nothing to do with it.
The one in north canton oh still had their animatronics still
Fnac heorists
I think quantum physics would be easier to understand than the Fnaf timeline 😂
I actually have fond recent memories of taking my Niece to Chuck e Cheese, and her being absolutely enraptured by the Chuck e Cheese animatronics. They really don't need to get rid of them, just update them with modern technology.
Five nights at candy's trailer
0:19 They didn't make the announcement after the movie. They made it all the way back in 2019.
I would indeed visit a real life pizza plex, Rockstar Freddie and Roxanne have my heart
LOL! Being a San Jose native, the most popular story about our chuck e cheese is that it's haunted by ghost kids.
Wow
I actually kinda agree, I’ll admit I haven’t gone back to a Chuck E. Cheese but the only reason why I’d go back is because I am into FNAF, not the other way around… I would actually really be interested in seeing a horror version of Chuck E Cheese if it came to fruition
Little do they know they’re actively fulfilling the story of fnaf👀
Well Mat, CEC has been trying to phase out the animatronics since the 90s, they literally made Studio C with the intention of only having Chuck E. but went with a concept suggested by someone at the company to just have his friends on a screen as puppets.
S fnsf style chuck e cheese horror restraint would go hard
matpat kinda sounds like AI in this video
Chuck E Cheese list of battles: 1. Aurora Shooting 2. Aaron Fechter / Showbiz Pizza / Rock A Fire Explosion 3. Various shootings, muggings, attacks outside of restaurants of Chucks in various states and dates and now 4. Lack of upgrades / updates to animatronics, parents and complaints to do befter or different while trying to make money and 5. Surge of FNAF over the years
It’s all Walt Disney’s fault
These merchware ads are super long and annoying 😒
I dont think it was intentional that FNAF became so popular but seeing the way Chuck E Cheese reacted after the movies and constant google searches for theory lore etc i could see it getting old. Its a shame because Chuck E Animatronics are being destroyed en masse and its effectively the end of the original animatronics as we know unless you plan to go back to Disney. Shame....
Cool
I’m surprised Fechter was never mentioned here, but surprised positively.
Of course MatPat can’t help himself into making more FNAF lore videos! 😅
I literally took my kid to Chuck E Cheese today. Place was still pretty packed. No animatronics tho 🤔
The reason why Eatertainment is on the decline is obviously because of Inflation. I mean, why spend money you don't have to entertain yourself at restaurants that make you pay for the "atmosphere"? The same can be said for pretty much any restaurant out there that costs a heavy penny in comparison to cheaper choices... of course, even the cheaper choices are being hit too, just not nearly as hard.
I not like there chuck e cheese robotics not good for that.  Yes I like freddy Fazbear's mega pizzaplex robotics can it's work good for that.
That why because they freddy Fazbear not like him chuck e cheese.  They wants get out of there freddy Fazbear hated chuck e cheese.  Fnaf better.
Chuck
The gasping background music is really annoying and distracting
the merge between show bizz and cec was more of show bizz buying out cec since cec was the one who threated bankruptcy back in the early 80's, infact the animatronics that are in cec use the skeletons of the old show bizz characters just re skinned, all thats left of show bizz now is just fans who are trying to collect the animatronics and restore them
If they really lean into the creepy factor this could be a great thing.
barcades are always an awesome place to go on dates. cheap, good food, and it brings you back to the time of 25c a game.
I've never seen an animitronic at a church e cheeses ever
i think this is a dumb business decision, cuz now they have nothing to attract customers other than their small arcade, ttheres no theatrics to bring in customers. now its just a smaller dave and busters with worse food. so now people are gonna go to dave and busters and chuck e cheese will become the next toys r us
I saw a Chuck E. Cheese with graffiti that said “ Covid killed chucky “ once
Just launch a fashion brand now.
Not gonna lie your merch is actually nice looking and creative
Didn't you correct Markiplier when he said the bite of '87? Didn't you correct him with the bite of '83? Why the sudden change of heart?
So it's capitalism, like always.
This video wasnt needed, its really just the cost cutting measures cec is doing. Fnaf was only a SMALL part of the problem
"Charles Entertainment cheese" why just why
You know I would probably love going to fnaf irl minus the chance of being murdered
Oh my god, those effin cards.  Don't say this: "We acknowledge taking inspiration from FNAF because we recognize the love our customers have for that franchise and figured it'd be cool for everyone to do so."  Say this: "We're going to treat you all like freakin' morons and pretend like our obviously copy-pasted concept is 100% our idea and we gonna pretend like we never heard of FNAF, because f*** you, that's why."  Way to earn some brownie points from your remaning customers, Chuck E's.
MatPat literally re mtelling his fnaf timeline but for chuck e cheese
I HATE HORRER
if they’re selling all of the defunct animatronic i can bet someone’s gonna buy a bunch and try to open a horror attraction
PLEASE BRING BACK THE 2020 INTRO IT WAS FIRE 🔥
Charles Entertainment Cheese TM is wild
after 10 years, im suprised CEC Entertainment havent tried to capitalise on the experience sooner, sure itd be expensive, so maybe alter 1 resturant per state (eg freddy fazbears pizzeria, fredbears family diner, and freddy fazbears pizza) and maybe leave some easter eggs around the rest. it would bring up proffits on both sides (not that scott needs it lol)
Geez, no wonder William and Henry made springlocks
honestly, I'd pay to be at a Fnaf location
Our local Chuck E. Cheese hasn’t had animatronics in years
Interesting thing to note:  Freddy's is also the name of a burger chain.  I was almost tempted to put into their suggestion box:  "If you want to hire someone for the weekday dinner shift, don't say you are looking to hire someone five nights a week.  TRUST ME ON THIS ONE!"  Surprised they ALSO haven't tried to ride on FNAF's coattails as well.
I’m actually making two animatronics. I’m making one OC which will be a weasel and I’m going to make spring trap. Due to my financial situation it wasn’t likely to happen but now it’s definitely going to happen.  Edit: I’m currently trying to decide what I’m going to make the endoskeleton out of. Originally I was thinking PVC pipe but now I don’t know. I like the idea of metal for its strength but I’m not entirely sure what I’m going to do.  After materials is the joints, particularly the shoulder and hip joints. I have a specific ball joint that I want to use. It’s just it’s gonna have to be completely custom so I don’t know how I’m gonna do that yet
Ain’t watch the vid but covid definitely did and the fact kids would rather play video games
I have proof of expensive prizes one time I was at Pizza Bonez and they had plastic Clark Kent glasses with no lens going for 12,000 tickets and they were much more cooler stuff for Less amounts of tickets just below them
Good video
I think it depends on what your values and interests are.   If I had 50 dollars, it may vary on the day of what I want to do with the kids. Every now and then, I will reward my kid with a video game.   However, I want to do something that creates memories. If there was more of them, I would do those trampoline parks or something like that. When they are older, I would love to take them to a Dave N’ Busters.   My family loved buying more points for the games on the card and always took advantage of the menu items that allowed you more credits on the card which means more playing time.   Yes, it is loud, but am glad they have games for every type of player.   And in the process, memories are made. Smiles on everyone’s faces. What is wrong with that.   My only issue is that they are geographically difficult to get to since they are not everywhere.
for entertainment and a meal youd go to chuckechease now i sit at my pc and eat
Bro I remember when I was 4 going there thinking it was heaven and begging my mom for the pizza but now I realize it was just a tiny arcade and the pizza was always kinda bad
Dave and busters have few to none for actual arcade games
I went to JJ’s because we were poor
I just thought the after effects of 2020 were to blame. I still don't go to movie theaters or get food in person other than the drive thru or uber eats nowadays.
John Oliver's "lastsqueaktonight" episode about Chuck E Cheese is pretty hard to beat.
Why does Mat sound akward in some points in the video? Like is anyone else getting this or am I going crazy? Like he sorta sounds abrupt in some cases or sounds sped up
Yep. Fnaf killed ChuckeCheese's 😟
*:o*
Well it actual makes sense if they rebrand and merge Chuck with Freddy to make the Freddy Fazbear Entertainment franchise a reality. The idea is right there, locked and loaded ready to make it happen
Yess. Fred e. Cheese I'd goand take all my fnaf loving kids.
“Bust Hippo Women” is definitely something I’d never imagine Mat say.
are we in a timeline where chuck e cheese x fnaf could be a real thing?
10:22 is where the advertising ends
Hay Mat! I just realized somthing about the fnaf movie. You know how in it michael has nightmares relating to his brothers death. It kind of made me think of fnaf 4 and how the person in it is hallucinating and having g nightmare about things that relate to the crying child's death! Confirming you play as Mike in fnaf 4!
Can we have matpat wear the aurora blazer in a gtlive?
FNAC THEORY PLZ MATPAT
Imagine if a slasher/horror movie was specifically made around your business' mascot, it might not be as dramatic as a complete shutdown but at the very least it'll give you a bad rep.
The rockstars rockstar chuck.e
Game+Food Theory
to add onto what mat has stated on theme park examples of tv screens in attractions is the issue that when theme parks lean into screens and less physical sets, such as universal, people often don’t like the experience. screens and projections can often give lack luster experiences as universal is over saturated with these types of experiences fans of the parks are known to dislike the mainly screen experiences. however disney is known for their physical sets and that’s what makes them better than their competitors. taking from these things the answer is that they should combine physical sets with screens and projections, most of universal’s most popular rides such as harry potter and the forbidden journey as well as the jurassic world ride already mentioned are successful and disney is also successful with their combinations such as the river journey avatar ride and rise of the resistance which proves the success of this type of venture.
i currently work at chuck e. cheese and my location literally tells us we are not allowed to associate at all with fnaf. also sooo many people come in and ask to buy the animatronics as if we have a say in what happens to them😭
I mean if anything I feel like that would hype the place.
San Antonio Texas still has animatronics at some of its locations!! I feel Chuck E. Cheese should be popping cuz of FNAF lol but I could just be saying that as a nostalgic fan. I was never scared of the robots lol
hi matpat
You should make a theory on why help wanted 1, security breach and the game's dlc is trying to warn us about the dangers on A.I IRL and that it could actually happen
Bro just imagine how many people would be lining up to go eat at a real FNAF pizzeria, Chuck E. Cheese is dumb for not taking advantage of it
I just bought the grimace shake
Why does golden Freddy have a blue eye in the thumbnail help
I smell a partnership
there pizza is amazing you dweebus
It's Charles entertainment cheese the third his brother's died in the war put some respect on his name
FINALLY! Someone said it. I've been wanting to design IRL FNAF locations for different ages for years! All because of my obsession with Disney! I feel so seen right now, thank you MatPat & Team Theorist. ❤
Please use better materials for your next drop
In Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, Santa is skinny for the whole movie until the end. How much food would Santa have to eat in order to gain that much weight in that short amount of time?
I keep seeing the new suit while thinking about wedding clothes and I’m so tempted but it’s just too simple for my taste.  I wish I could custom order the same pattern suit but with a slightly different shape/fit and a little added sparkle like beads or something.  If y’all ever come up with a fancy suit that is themed after your channel or has a circuit pattern like some of your old merch I might have to sew on tiny beads and mirrors into the design to make it shiny af and go with that because I just love that pattern so much and I’m too tired and overwhelmed to make a whole pantsuit by hand for myself and not have it fit weird no matter how early I start making it and I’m not that good at sewing anyways 😂
As a manager now we get questioned about FNAF a lot and as a fan myself it’s exhausting explaining why we got rid of the animatronics. Long story short, We are trying to sell to a new CEO so we need to stop spending useless money on animatronics and other stuff.
In case anyone wants to know, they got rid up of them to upgrade them with better tech. You try singing and dancing for 40 years with the same tech in your knees. They even admitted it. The one in northridge is just cuz they paid for them.
Scott should honestly just open an actually Freddy's Pizzeria, make it into an experience and show, etc.
i would love to go to a place like freddys: animatronic performances, arcades and pizza!
3:56 Uhh, but there's an official rockstar freddy too...
My dad was born in 1987 and I asked him if something bad happened at a pizzeria and he said yes 💀
Finally. A Theory video I can get behind.
I’m actually so sad that they’re removing the animatronics
I thought the reason why they getting rid of them is because they’re afraid that someone copied the purple man but now this is more information that I know of thank you for sharing this information 😊
Come on Bite of 24.
making a "FNoF" and giving employees explicit instructions not to talk about how they're blatantly basing it off FNAF is wild though
Literally pizzeria simulator
Shout out to that editor that snuck in a Megumin figure in the video.
okay, the editor who threw HIM in toward the end has earned a thumbs up and a over head heel crush to the face from me. anyone who doesn't know what i'm talking about, look at the bottom left corner while mats mentioning a licensing deal.
The hole thing between show bizz pizza and Chucky chies reminds he of the drama between Henry and Afftion like a lot of stuff lines up to he point it feels like scott took inspration from more then just the animatronics lookin creepy
Hey I go to north ridge every week, it ain’t that bad Bru, like a 45 min drive from my house
Idk about y’all, but as someone in my 20’s, if Chuck E Cheese’s said they would reimagine the animatronic shows I would be totally sold
Cinema cafe is an outlier. You order food while watching a movie.
realistically chuck e cheese turning their entire franchise on it's head and going from children's entertainment to horror is ...*very unlikely* but I would love to see something like concept come to light in some way, a haunted house mixed with a restaurant type thing sounds amazing, as long as I don't get jumpscared while taking a bite
Another thing to note: Five Nights at Chuck E’s fan games… Need I say more?
Another day of matpat giving tips to multi-million Doller companies
tbh I hadn't realized they came back after the bankruptcy, I thought they'd just gone out of business
Fnaf is more better
Whilst the idea of repurposing the chuck e cheese animatronics into fnaf ones seems like a good idea, Original Creator of FNAF Scott Cawthon has stated that he doesn’t want a IRL Freddy’s Pizzaria to happen, because of the unchecked psychos out there who would see this a try to recreate the very murders that sent Matpat down the chain of insanity FNAF is known as in the theorist community as a whole. Whilst the horror idea is a good one, perhaps don’t go too far with it. Ok chuck?
I literally pulled over when I saw a sign for a Chuck E Cheese while traveling out of state this week. Went in and it was kinda sad. Really small space. The animatronics were gone, too, but the Lil dance floor replacement was underwhelming. Granted, I am now a full grown adult, but still. The pizza did look better quality, though! Meh, I was always more of a Showbiz kid myself, anyways.
I think it was actually really smart of them to take advantage of all the Hype around the FNAF movie, and make it look like this is WHY they got rid of the animatronics. It gave them the excuse they’ve been wanting for years and brought more attention to the brand, however, I think they need some long term solutions or they’re going to have to ride out the wave and wait until our generation (heavily focused on nostalgia) comes back with our own kids.
I don’t care what Scott Cawthon or anyone says  An actual FNAF themed restaurant would be AMAZING!
Chuck E. Cheese is an ozempic baddie
but then again someone would probably recreate the events of fnaf…. there’s some terrible evil twisted people in this world
It’s not like the animatronics at Chuck E. Cheese we’re all ready scary because they are
If Chuck E Cheese was smart, they would go the opposite direction and embrace the horror. Move away from a kid friendly place and make it a full on interactive horror establishment targeting adults and mature teens
As a young teen I would absolutely spend a day playing mortal kombat over a cheese themed child labor factory
Honestly, they should bring back the cigar smoking version of him and have him swing jazz songs And just market the place towards adults having a long day have this New York mobster ripoff sing Jazz songs as you just drink your problems away
We can only keep dreaming that Chuck E Cheese does a 1 time collab with FNAF. (With a lot of Security)
I think he stoped singing lol😂
NORTHRIDGE MENTIONED🗣️🗣️🚨🚨🚨‼️‼️
I would not have described Showbiz Pizza's acquisition of Chuck E Cheese as being "forced to merge due to declining sales."  I would describe it as "Nolan Bushnell didn't know how to run a restaurant business, so Showbiz Pizza was able to buy the whole thing when it was struggling."  Great video for sure though!
chuckle ceese
Thank you for this video!
I know that Scott doesn’t want to make a real fnaf location but it would really make bank. Matt is correct us gen z crave a good scare. I’m not sure why we do but we do.
Good video as always
what happened to the original openings on the theory channels? i miss them ;(
Anyone else remember Showbiz having Beer? I'm almost 100% sure the one in Chattanooga had beer back in the late 1980's early 90's.
Like this comment if you would want a real life Fazbear Entertainment with animatronics
Wait a minute, now that begs the question. If Chuck goes creepy and such, and that the merging of two things is the same as will and Henry combining...Are we about to unironically recreate the entire story?
I didn't know Chuck E. Cheese still had animatronics. I haven't been to our local one in a few years, but they only had a person wearing a costume.
It’s a great idea but Scott wouldn’t make a colab. He wouldn’t because he thinks the same thing that happens in the games might be recreated
when i first went to chuck e cheese with my mom when i was 9 years old, i wanted to go because it was the only local chuck e cheese, and because i was a hardcore fnaf fan
Is this a chuck-e-cheese video or a Fnaf fan game theory?
Or hear me out. Making and managing $1000 robots that all they do is sing and move. Very slightly is kinda expensive. You know technicians. Electricians Managing power Powerball specific parts that probably aren't around anymore On top of an already dying chain.
I was waiting for this
I remember one time at chuck e cheese my friends and I touched the chuck e animatronic's foot and took a selfie together
DIE CHUCKIE U WILL NEVER BE AS GOOD AS FREDDYS!!!!!! hahahahahahaha!!!!!!!!!! (Sorry guys...)
To quote the greatest Vtuber of all time... "It's *CHARLES ENTERTAINMENT III!* The first brother died in the war. Put some respect on the name!" -Heavenlyfather in that one RussianBadger video about Left 4 Dead 2
15:01 I'm not sure making those animatronics are a good idea
Let's be honest, FNAF didn't _make_ animatronics creepy, it just brought that sentiment to the forefront.
Probaly one of the worst opinions, but in my opinion Chuck E. Cheese has the best pizz, I haven’t had it since my freind from my soccer teams bday, which was when I was like 5, and I’m 13 now, but I used to love Chuck E. Cheese pizza
Wasn’t expecting that last second FNAC reference.
They started pulling back the animatronics a year ago. Had nothing to do with FNAF. You just want yet another excuse to talk about your obsession with FNAF.
Honestly I believe the pandemic is what killed chuckles 😊
Strange the one i went to in Oklahoma city hasn't had the animatronics since the 90s
If Chuck E Cheese turned themselves into a horror attraction, I would go there WEEKLY
Why you hating on Benihana ☹
I thought they were removed 5 years ago.
I finally go to chuke cheses in peace🎉🎉🎉🎉
I just had Benihana for dinner lol.
They announced ed they're being back the animatronics to select locations s few weeks ago. This whole video is based on a BS premise.
So about Bowlero, should I not be working for that company?
Carl is the first clue 0:55
MATPAT REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME YOU DISCUSSED FNAF AND CHARLES E CHEDDER
What about Round one? Oh wait, that's arcade and bowling.
As a fan of both Chuck E. Cheese and fnaf (not the rockstar era aka the current era) I hate 2.0/the animatronic removal :|
man, if we live in the timeline where chuck e cheeses are turned into freddy fazbear's pizzerias I'm gonna lose it
You have a great point, if they partnered with fnaf i would so go and see it
This theory popped up when i went to a Chuck E Cheese esque place for a birthday party
0:51 it wasnt fnaf   IT WAS THE CUPCAKE
I’ve seen people suggest that Chuck-E-Cheese do this! Take old worn/closed down restaurants, and turn them into FNAF restaurants and experiences! That would make them a ton of money and bring even more relevance to the brand!
Honestly, they should just take Chuck E Cheese's, (and all copies of it), and just sell the whole thing to rebrand it as an entire FNAF experience. This franchise isn't going anywhere for a long time, and people today are more hooked on nostalgia than anything else. By making it a FNAF thing, they could make a LOT more money because people would flock to it. They only went to chuck e cheese's for the closest experience they could get to FNAF. I know people would be a little too hesitant to do it because of the real life William Afton's (if you know, you know), but that can easily be avoided if you have a guide with you at all times
is that sans undertale in the thumbnail
One difference between the "barcade" model and what Chuck E. Cheese provides that isn't mentioned but may also be a factor is what dfoes/doesn't cost money.  I can only speak from my own experience here, and this may not be the norm, but in general, barcades have a majority, or at least some, free-to-play machines, whereas I believe the likes of Chuck E. Cheese still require you to buy tokens to play, thus costing more money (while also being inconvenient in that you would periodically have to step away to buy more tokens).  I presume barcades would make up the cost with a cover charge and/or more expensive food and drink, but given my druthers, I'd rather go to the place I ONLY pay for food.drink, and maybe pay a little more as a result, rather than the one where I'm constantly putting money into individual machines.  I'm much more likely to stick around longer, since I'm getting the fun while feeling like I'm not being nickle-and-dimed away, thus ironically perhaps spending more money than I would have if I felt like I were.
If only they stop price gouging
to be fair, theyve been testing this in locations for years. my local chuck e cheese was one of the testing locations.
My charles will always smoke a cigar and leave me feeling like i might get stabbed.
In ohio, it was on its last legs anyways. I think it scared a lot of people away.
I didn’t even know Chuck E Cheese still had animatronics. Ours got rid of them like a decade ago and only had a person with a mascot head. I assumed they did that everywhere.
I’m 100% certain that if Chucky cheese fully leaned into the 80s theme. Bringing back their old animatronics, character designs, and aesthetic. They would still be in business and probably booming.  Get rid of the lame cgi skater mouse, I want the snazzy bow tie rat with a Brooklyn accent that smokes and makes fun of his coworkers for fun. Give me personality in my family restaurant. Give me cheap, give me tacky and cheesy. Give me creepy robots that are poorly maintained and managed. I want Chucky cheese as it was, as it could be.
The problem with family venues is that there are far far fewer children than there used to be.
Scott would never go for it
Imagine all the robots are stored somewhere unused but they come back to life. All it takes is one guy to go in.
Meanwhile alcohol experiences and places like the cauldron are thriving so it's not that there's no market, it's how it's being marketed.
I think it's funny that Barcades are on the rise when the one in my town closed this year. But part of that is because they didn't do any upkeep on anything, so you could rarely play with anything fun.
ill be honest that blue theorywear sweater goes hard
We need chuck e cheese x Willy's wonderland immediately
The real killer is late stage capitalism. Do you know how expensive it is to repair those machines? It's cheaper to hire more employees than to fix those machines.
I really hope at some point Matthew and the team get paid for saving multiple multi million dollar companies
I feel like most people probably just go for the arcade games and pizza that alone is probably enough reason to get rid of them
Does Chuck E Cheeses still have the no adults without kids allowed there? I can’t find it anywhere anymore but I know it was there when I was 18. Now I can only find the opposite no kids without an adult present.
Expensive stuff dude o: man I'm still thinking of eclipse
I love how he says Rockstar as if there isn't rockstar animatronics
As someone who is huge into CEC history and animatronics in general I don't think Fnaf necessarily killed animatronics but it was rather due to the change in technology and animatronics becoming outdated, as much as it sucks to see them go, the company had been moving in this direction for a while.  I don't necessarily think its the smartest decision to cater to kids screaming about how the animatronics are evil but rather find a new way to reinvent that aspect of the restaurants. Unfortunately itll probably never happen.
I would say no, because there were some chuckle-cheeses where the animatronics already were not present. I guess that iconic part of the...restaurant? Has been in decline for a long time now. I'm honestly surprised they're still a franchise. They've been kinda suffering for a few years it seems.
We knew something was about food when they’re talking about Chuck E. Cheese and it’s the food theory channel
12:47 idk Mat, that megumin figure kinda fire
Just calling this out, but is anyone else surprised that Mat has yet to look at the official FNAF cookbook yet?
I would definitely prefer that we keep some tactile stuff like these animatronics around, there's just simply no comparing a screen and a physical robot the latter is WAY more fun, but uh I don't think fully going in on horror is the move here.
I've been saying that for years. Why isn't there a fnaf restaurants. As popular as fnaf is would make a lot of money
i still remember 1978 when i screamed "GRAND CANYON" and tossed foxy down the grand canyon
What they need to change is their cardboard pizza. Make it actually edible is step one
If it's based on the film then it won't be that scary, because the film only scares those who have never seen a horror film
I hope Charles Enternainment Cheese watches this!
Somebody got a raise for making that call
Chuck E cheese's animatronic always gave me the creeps, let's just be glad William Afton isn't real...☺
Scott Cawthon is afraid if a real Freddy Fazbear restaurant exists then someone would start murdering children there
It's funny, cause up until you said it, I was thinking "how cool would a horror entertainment venue with animatronics be"
6 hour club (lenny face)
near where i live there is a barcade , one half is the bar area with some games that  kids arent allowed in and the  family side whre kids are allowe but at 9pm  it goes to 21 and up  until 2 am
I’m sorry, Pat, but your pronunciation of Northridge was triggering as a local
I think the problem they want to avoid is if they lean TOO HEAVILY into the fnaf side then some psycho might attempt to recreate the games irl. That’s exactly why Scott has said he doesn’t want really pizzerias.
Omg, knock it off with this gen z garbage... 'People' are PEOPLE, stop categorizing (and inherently subjegating)
unironically, if chuck e cheese licensed FNaF and made real animatronics, i bet their revenue would go up a ton
As a 34yo man, if CEC leaned into the creepy animatronic genre, Id definitely be more inclined to go there with my gen z son who loves the horror stuff, especially fnaf.
bro is that huggy wuggy
5:13 honestly I love Rainforest Cafe 🍽️ one of my favorite restaurants honestly.
When they get rid of all these animatronics you KNOW they are going to put them in one huge warehouse. Now that’s what we need a fan game about
Reminder that some Chuck E Cheese locations did sell alcohol
With Benihana they are definitely not a novelty because the food is good
Wouldn’t it boost sales like people would see FNAF and be like “ohh I can see this in real life-ish”
I remember I kissed a girl at a chuck e cheese. After we won the big prize on the light stop game.
As a Chuck E. Cheese fan, this episode title sure did make me curious on how this topic would be covered LOL Tbh I think a large portion of factors can be mentioned in regards to the animatronic band removal but it's still pretty tragic  They used to have a slogan that said "Make magic, without it we're just another pizza place!" and now that feels bitter because of them removing the one thing that REALLY set them apart from anything else  It's honestly quite a shame and as nice as it is that they're keeping the band at Northridge, that band has several issues that I doubt they'll fix anytime soon I hope more stores keep their band [or more reopen with the band as a retro store gimmick] however it's all unpredictable at this point, tbh wouldn't surprise me if the brand itself dies within the next decade
If they're trying to appeal to adults I think that's a good decision. I remember when I got too old to go to chuck E cheese, because its really only set up for extremely tiny kids. I was still a little kid maybe 8 but I couldn't even play in the ball pit anymore because they didn't want the even smaller kids to get hurt. If their target market is only up to 6 years old then everyone else will be bored.  If Chuck E Cheese could lean into the creepy factor and make it more edgy that would be hilarious. It would trigger some nostalgia, while being more suitable for adults.
It's official, FNaF is on every theory channel now. I'm gonna scream.
heck ya
Chuck E Cheese had a dance floor
The Chuck E Cheese I used to go to as a kid didn't have animatronics, they had grown ups in costumes that would walk around the restaurant. More than once, the mouse was quite a creeper. Honestly would have preferred the robots
You're missing a key factor when it comes to places like Chuck E Cheese. Yes the younger audiences enjoy certain experiences, but it directly clashes with the older parents who bring them to it.  Leaning into the horror elements that makes fnaf makes parents more wary of the brand because of the association with danger.  In previous decades, younger audiences and older audiences interests were a little more aligned than what they are now. With more emphasis on online entertainment than previously the divide between what the different audiences enjoy has widened, with a larger disconnect between differing generations.  This leads to difficulties with franchises that previously thrived becoming unsure how to market to the differing generations. Generalized experiences simply are no longer enough to grab the attention of both parents and their children. But leaning into one of the groups quickly alienates the other.  While your suggestion is great in terms of trying to reach out to new demographics, it does have a flaw that it will alienate previous demographics, which the company probably doesn't want (quite possibly due to them being of that same older generation that would be alienated).
On the note of Disney and Universal, the last time I was at the latter was when I noticed how many simulator rides there are with screen displays everywhere. Sure, they’re cool and fun. But I can’t imagine I’m the only one noticing the abundance. Wonder how long “screen rides” are gonna be in fashion before both parks panic about everyone deciding 3 minutes of screens and simulated bumps isn’t worth the price of entry there either.
I was thinking it be cool to have arcade games being horror themed have them be old Scott games or fnaf 8 bit mini games or even small analog horrors like that one Bons burgers video
As someone who works at Main event I had no idea this was happening
They took my Chuck E. Cheese’s animatronics away years ago. I miss them…
They already had. It's all videos now.
see chuck e cheese has also had multiple murders and deaths sooo😭
Imagine Chuck E Cheese decides to use the very old designs for Chuck and the band. Very unlikely but eh would be cool
Theory idea: How do you ACTUALLY solve world hunger
I have BEEN saying they should do a fnaf partnership
Place your bets if actual chuckie cheese corporate actually sees this video
Now is the time for Scott to start up an actual Freddy’s restaurant chain!
It’s actually interesting that Chuck E. Cheese was starting to file for bankruptcy similar to how FNAF kind of did it mostly in the first game. This possibly states that Chuck E. Cheese is now officially FNAF but in real time.
Do straw protect your teeth
Dave and Busters is actually recovering. The stock is up 33.32 YTD
You Know Freddy Fazbear's should start replacing their animatronic's with videos istead ... that way . Purple People Dressed as Yellow Rabbits will stop turning them into killing machines
The Aurora Borealis on my suit? More likely than you think
Removing animatronics from Chuck E Cheese is literally removing the reason they are open in the first place.
yeah I think chuck E cheese had it's time but that time is certainly over in so many ways. Good video
I like theory ware, but it should still be game/channel related
mascot franchise restaurants have been on the decline for years now, fnaf and the mascot horror genera have honestly probably given them a popularity boost
no chuck e cheese just let the fnaf movie borrow the endo skelotens bc some of the fnaf movie parts were real endos
Bro chunk e cheese is just planning to quit its money making machines probably cause people keep making up stories of 5 missing kids   👇FNAF ADDICTS😉
5h
Hey 5M
Most stuff these days is too expensive for families and low food quality is not worth spending money on
Bro when je was talking about barcades a cidearcade ad just popped up😂😂
IM 5 HOURS LATEE….BUT AT LEAST I SAW THIS MASTERPIECE
FNAF is COOL HAHA
Everyone Knows that Chuck e Cheese Pizza 🍕 is the only reason to go to Chuck e Cheese 🧀 Ong 🙏🏿
I would pay so much money to see a partnership between FNAF and Chuck E. Cheese.
I blame the spoon, it's a soup spoon
I protected they could add Holograms.
Actually showbiz pizza was the inspiration for five nights at Freddy’s. Scott Cauthen even reached out to Aaron Fechter, the creator of the animatronics at showbiz for creepy animatronic pictures to use in help-wanted. Aaron sent him the pictures, but Scott ended up not using them, because he didn’t want to taint the animatronic brand.
Theres Bearley eatertainment in the uk and I definitely see why
It’s slightly annoys me when people say showbiz pizza didn’t last like Chuck E. Cheese did, Chuck E. Cheese filed for bankruptcy in the 90s, and showbiz pizza bought the rights and merged. At first they used both characters, then they switched to just Chuck E. Cheese characters. But in my opinion, showbiz pizza had the better animatronics. And I’ve driven hours to go see them at a location that still has them, not Chuck E. Cheese though. They’ve been sold to other companies now.
I would love to visit a real fnaf location
His full name is actually Fredrick Fazbearington
You mention "Barcade" as a successful adults-only version of the model yet fail to mention the most significant consideration of them all: space. I've been to three Barcade locations in NYC, two of which I used to go to regularly when I worked in the city, and even though there were a decent number of arcade machines present in each the spaces were physically small compared to your average Dave & Buster's (including the D&B in Times Square) or other similarly themed restaurants mentioned in the video. Not including the cost of maintenance of the machines (which would likely require specialist knowledge of a bygone era _and_ being around alcoholic beverages/people drinking said beverages increases the likelihood of needing said maintenance), the upkeep costs of the _locations themselves_ are much lower because of the smaller spaces.
Living in the grim north of the UK we don't have anything like Chuckie cheese appart from at theme parks
As awesome as a "real life" FNAF experience would be, unfortunately the likelihood of it happening any time soon is pretty low. Scott said a while back that he'd most likely never make FNAF a reality due to the chances of a "real life" William Afton/MCI happening. There's unfortunately crazy people out there that would go that far.
This video is so real
I really like  the dance floor it is awesome it help   kids excise after  eating pizza
Felix Kranken
If we ever get to know what the profit on the theorywear is compared to the channels, perhaps we have another Mcdonald's actually making money on being a landlord here.
I've NEVER been creeped out by the Chuck E animatronics. Admittedly when cousins would have birthday parties there I was old enough to know they were robots and young enough not to care. I just found them fun, even the one in the grown-ups lounge. I'd sneak in to set that one off as well. I also liked the games and strobe cave/mousehole thing. I've never been a pizza eater but I enjoyed the rest of the experience. Yes, even the ball pit.
The heavy from TF2 is a massive guy. He has especially massive arms and hands. He has an item called the sandvich. It is *HALF* of a baloney sandwich, but we have seen what that sandwich looks like in HIS hand. And something tells me these ain't your average slices of bread, balogna, tomato, and swiss that the heavy be pullin' out of that refridgerator. They gotta be big. And I'm curious to find out the math on figuring out how large the sandvich would have to be and what it would take to assemble the sandvich at the size it actually IS, for oneself  If it isn't enough for a full video, perhaps it could be a short?
I want to go to Chuck E. Cheese to see the animatronics simply because I love FNaF. I full well KNOW that they're not really connected much other than the rat inspired the bear, but my ideal fun day would be a day off from school with friends in front of the "real" FNaF animatronics. My dad even says that they should "leave the kid-friendliness at the door and go full horror". I'd be happy even if it only happened during Halloween.
FNAF: Are we copying it or not? Chuck Cheese: HEY2 HEY2 Watch your mouth then is our brand a
How do you choose what theory to put it in? First off there is good so food theory. But fanf is a game so game theory. Also people think the fanf movie also plays a role in it so how do you choose?
This. I would love to have a reason to visit CEC, but they've done nothing but decay over the years, and they won't even do something about it. So depressing. A CEC teen+ haunted house, done well, would have brought in a TON of money this year...but instead it was this lame flop intended for no one in particular. Why? Who's in charge of the show that won't let it age up with their audience? Such a loss.
Benihana is my favorite restaurant of all time and I go several times a year. The food is amazing, idk what MattPatt means the food isn’t worth the entertainment. I go for the food not the show.
What if fnaf was based on the past of Chucky cheese almost everything fits
"His brother died in the war put some respect on his name." Heavenly
Rockstar Chuck E Cheese hmmmm…  Rockstar Freddy, Chica, Foxy, and Bonny in fnaf pizza sim
I'm a scare actor and the majority of the people I scare are 10 -30 I have some 5 year olds do better than most adults
I can’t get enough of this channel I’m so addicted nice vid btw!❤
I was a CEC cast member for several years, and I’ve disagreed with a lot of this. Now I have a 2 year old and I’m glad they’ve adapted to the new age of kids. If anything, the grown ups that grew with CEC are trying their best to relive that magic, but Covid ruined it
Is Showbiz just Billy Bobs cause we have one in WV and Billy Bob is just Freddy downgraded 😂
I not happening
Cicis pizza is good and cheap
I stopped going to Dave & Buster's when they would not let me make half restaurant shots on the basketball game
Blud forgot about the rockstar animatronics from FNAF 6
Congrats reaching 5 mil
9:16 😅
FNAF has finally killed Chuck E cheese 😂
CONGRATS ON 5 MILLION SUBS🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
If they did a fnaf branded thing they’d explode
Bruh imagine Chuck E. Cheese becomes a scary franchise
What franchise is Matpat referring to at 15:45?
Uhhhh......people *_like_* to be scared!?! Just when I think humanity can't get _ANY_ weirder.   *sighs in despair* Probably not the last that's gonna happen*  *hangs head*  🎶"Hello darkness, my old friend....." 🎶
Matpat fr glanced universal and only brought up one thing, I will not tolerate this. When Jurassic Park got changed in to Jurassic World, he made it sound like there were several moments that were replaced by screens, but it was really just one moment. The rest of the ride is more or less the same but with HUGE additions that DO involve animatronics. The first three would be the indominous rex head before the hill, the Blue animatronic at the near end, and another indoominous from the cieling. But that's not just all, they made a full body, life sized animatronic of the indominous rex at the end of the ride. It's honestly amazing how they pulled it off. Universal also made the life of pets ride which features a huge amount of animatronics everywhere.
Honestly, I would love to see this! Where do we sign the petition to get this done? 🤣🤣🤣
why is there a weird bgm?
So if Chuck is short for Charles, would Freddy be short for Frederick?
I remember when I was standing in front of the CEC animatronics when I was really little. I remember standing in front of Jasper just watching him look around. After a while when I went back to Chuck's for a birthday I felt like I was too old for that place at the time. They got rid of all the other characters and it was just Chucky standing alone. I actually felt bad for him lol. Then I last time I ever stepped in a CeC they had gotten rid of all the animatronics and there was just a dance floor with puppets on the tv. I remember just staring at the screen like: What am I looking at. After the world shut down due to the Pandemic, the CeC I went to as a child didn't survive. I was actually kinda sad about it. The whole reason I love animatronics is thanks to Fnaf.
Theory m: Fnaf killed Chuck E. Cheese to open their own real life chain and would make infinite money essentially due to no competition and it’s fame 🤔😲
4:00 i think he forgot about the rockstar animatronics from fnaf 6
16:11 fin.
Nice video
They were dying back when I was a kid and going there XD They could have cashed in on the FNAF bandwagon/trend if they had gone the right way, because people LOVE animatronics again -because- of FNAF.. which is also weird.
Im glad i grew up in an era when there was objects instead of screens lol..i kinda feel bad for new kids
lol, just watched a ride breakdown video before this.  both animatronics and digital can break down...
1:10 is it just me or do those skeeball lanes look a bit like Freddy’s face?
Hi MatPat I was wondering if you do a video of which fizzy drinks would make the best marinade for chicken wings one time
I would travel to go to a fnaf restaurant 😂❤
Har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har
You know, on the topic of theme parks using screens and such more these days, Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway is actually one of my favorite rides at Disneyland now. The incredible use of the technology in the ride makes it stand out WAY more than most other rides, and it's an amazing experiences both in and out of the queue. That said, the animatronic effects still have their place in something like say Rise of the Resistance. It's not what tech you use, it's how you use it.
4:04 cries in rockstar animatronic
10:21 sponsor skip
I started watching Matpat on game theory because it was about the cool science in video game, like how fast Sonic is, or if you could survive a fall in a haybale like in assassins creed. Now it's all about FNAF, always about FNAF, nothing but FNAF content.  Please come back to your science root, no more FNAF please.
Are you taken ur kids to a digital theme park ?
8:10 meanwhile me having to pay $40 per person
Interesting to watch this as I eat my lunch on shift while working at an arcade
Ok, but we all know that they aren't bold enough to make that much of a change. The backlash would be too threatening
Week 4 of asking for a video on gushers I want to know what color has the most juice. I miss last week sorry about that.
Chucke cheese already is terrifying to children they need to know that and lean into it there is a reason why fnaf came about and its the terrifying nature of the uncanny animatronics
a FNAF restaurant would be cool but i already know people would try to bite of 87 themselves
Matpat did you go in for the pizza during the pandemic? 4:52
my local chuck e cheese hasn't had animatronics for years so I thought all locations had the animatronics removed years ago lol
Jollibee(on going) Mcdonalds(on going) Chuck e cheese:
I go regularly to Hard Rock for the food I love it
HOW DID FNAF END UP ON FREAKIN FOOD THEORY XD
I GOT A CHUCK E CHEESE AD IN THIS VIDEO 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I know this isnt game theory but matpat is the type of guy who receives a question you would probably answer oh its just game logic but no, MAT WILL GO FIND THE mathematical answer to ANYTHING, and i mean it, just look at (I can’t believe i have to use this as an example) his skibidi toilet episode he managed to turn a dumb gen alpha meme me and my friends should (according to the YouTube algorithm) be watching into an enjoyable original video of his own! Even though the series is the same repetitive thing every single time, he managed to somehow figure out th3 series is about old and new stuff in the tv industry 😂? Sure theres no backing that realistically but it’s entertaining, it’s also important to point out I don’t think his episodes are fake, i mean, did you think that before I watched the food theory episode on sonic id know hed break his legs? No! Because truly mat is the only person with the courage not to go the easy route by saying it’s game logic, but legitimately spending weeks looking for the answers we’ve always wanted but never actually asked for his work is absolutely insane and incredibly entertaining, you know why? Because hes the only one with the experience passion and absolute titanium strong will to do so. It truly shows that if you want something you can get it. In case matpat or anyone in the team has the time to see this, thank you. I like coming back here and binge watching this like it’s my late night shark tank episode watchthrough congrats on everything from Portugal to the entire team! If you read it this far. Im sorry for writing an entire 20 minute videoscript that i will probably turn into a video, anyway thanks!
Chucky should embrace fnafbet it would do extremely well
I have a sin to confess... Chucky cheese pizza is my favorite pizza 😔
It was the reason I actually went there after not being there for years
Also of you look at the “5 nights of fun” poster, bottom right it says “ special appearance by everyone’s favorite PURPLE GUY, Mr. Munch.” They knew exactly what they were doing.
Everything is going out because no body has any money!!!!!
As a 40-something who grew up in the Midwest in the 1980s and 90s, the first I heard of Chuck E. Cheese was when they cruelly replaced all Show-Biz locations with the rat in 1992.  As I had already imprinted on the Show-Biz characters and their "Rock-afire Explosion" show, I have never really forgiven the company for robbing the second half of my childhood of one of my favorite parts of the first half of it by choosing that direction instead of going the opposite way.  Thus, I can't help grinning when I hear that the company is having to do away with its animatronics.  I consider FNAF to be "Billy Bob's Revenge"!
No
The Chuck-E-Cheese in my hometown closed down a year or two before the pandemic… I honestly forgot that they existed at all anymore
Jesus. Even on Food Theory he cannot escape FNAF.
“Gee Mr. Krabs. Why are you shutting down the Krusty Krab?”  “People just don’t seem interested in going out anymore. They think it’s too much trouble to leave home.”  — Mr Krabs to Spongebob; Revenge of the Flying Dutchman  To think RotFD of all games would predict the modern era. Kinda spooky.
Grounded Theory
A collab with Candys would be huge ngl
For a Christmas theory: in elf, it’s stated that elf’s have a diet of candy, candy canes, syrup, and candy corns. Would a human actually able to survive and grow off of an entire diet of sugar like that, for 30 years or even more?
fnaf IS chuck e cheeses
Ironic💀
Benihana has always been delicious!
Probably just a little but I think that and just a bit more then just fnaf…but it probably had lot to do with it
I highly doubt they will partner up because Scott said he was scared to do it because he knows there are fans out there who will try stuffing kids into the suits.
i've never experienced the robots, but i think that a semilution, is to have them go off reandomly, no schedule at all just rabdom uninturuptable clips of songs and things they ussually play. this way if one or 2 break they can be removed, i've seen most also have screens which could play into it as well by having them still apear up there digitally while their physically being repaired. i think this might do allot, when put with your sulutions to be more exact.
The Chuck E. Cheese electronics always scare me
8:50 "keep him quietly playing in the corner" even when i was younger i'd always talk to myself while playing games XD
Bread
Chuck E. Cheese just needs to turn off the lights and randomly turn on the animatronics, with warped, distorted voices/music and problem solved.
I think instead of a partnership with FNAF, CC should invent their own game with their own lore and a fresh backstory.
1:46 any fan game creators?
Barcades are amazing. It's everything we grew up with, but set up for us in our current ages. It's Just an industry that agreed to grow up with their demographic. I'm taking my partner to one for our 6th anniversary this week.
The movie was awesome btw we went the day after premier day and we had so much fun 😂
Contrary to popular belief, me and my family actually likes Chuck E Cheese’s pizza.
Well this video just made me sad. I love animatronics.
FNAF INVADING THE OTHER CHANNELS
Nah i hope they don't put one of the Philippines restaurants in food theory channel
Listen it ain't the bear's fault that CEC Entertainment sucks eggs when it comes to maintaining their restaurant's image.
welp going to chuck e cheese today with my friends
this vid should be called matpat saving chucke chesese with FANF
Some Chuck E Cheese locations used to have interactive consoles where kids could look at different camera feeds placed around the restaurant. They should have kept those around to appeal to FNAF fans.
Well that idea of partnership would work, it would be more complicated.  Scott has stated that he does not want anyoone to open a real life fnaf resteraunt in fear of some psycho who wanted to recreate the events of the games, which we all know is filled with killing.  If it were to happen then the spiritual stuff would be gone and we would be left with dead bodies in anamatronics.  People would report they have a foul odor though.
word
Ima be honest... Fnaf is less scary then chuck e. cheese
CEC got rid of their animatronics LONG before the FNAF Movie released their first trailer
Its all fun and games until someone going to try and recreate the events of the game
I don't think I've ever been to a Chuck-E-Cheese. Part of that was I got jumpscared by a gorilla in a Rainforest Cafe and mascots we a fear of mine for a bit (I still don't like them but it's more of a "you know that Goofy is a middle-aged actor sweating to death and hating his job" kind of uncomfortable). The other part was there was a closer place called Grand Slam and while it probably wasn't close to the arcade Chuck-E-Cheese was it had laser tag, dodgeball for birthday parties, and this really cool play place which was fun to climb around.   Regardless, the loss of the rat and his band is going to be world changing and if anything, they need to use him MORE. Lean into the Chucky use him to market some exclusive attraction.
I personally think they did ruin. You can't even see a chuck e cheese video without some kid say "FNAF IRL AAAAA"
Nolan Bushnell is the real William Afton
<3 tednivision is a wonderful soul
I think you're, to some extent wrong about Benihana. Their food is hardly more expensive than the cheesecake factory or  Red Robin and at least the one in my town still sees packed tables every night but i admit it could be different in other parts of the world
I don't their reputation was  helped by all the Sea Bonnies and Killed Kids..
I'd LOVE to see Chuck E. Cheese take on a horror adaptation. This might sound silly but, growing up, I was terrified of that place, the animatronics, and the ppl in the suits- VERY similar to FNAF- and that's what attracted me to FNAF in the first place. Since Scott doesn't want to open restaurant or amusement park, C.E.C has a HUGE advantage because they already have that + the history of creepy animatronics! I would go just for the nostalgic fear and unease I felt as a kid.
matpat love you bunches but every time you post a theory about chuck e. cheese as a chuck e. cheese fan i want to help and correct you. talk to me
Honestly I don't think a partnership w/ FNAF is gonna get CEC anywhere. What CEC really needs is to be run by someone who cares about the franchise and is willing to put quality over quantity and people over profits.   Also FNAF is probably why CEC's Twitter page has turned off comments for all its posts. It was getting to the point of obnoxious.
When i worked at chuck e cheese 2 years ago they were already in the process of removing the animatronics, most of them were broken and they were too expensive to fix  so they're getting replaced  by a dance floor
This whole channel is just an echo chamber for FNAF fans.  As someone who is more objective, let me tell you, Chuck E Cheese leaning into FNAF would be a terrible business decision.  The amount of horror kooks they would attract would not compare to the number of children they would be driving away in fear.  Now, if they made a different type of restaurant that went with that theme, that would probably go very well, as they could hit both sides of the market (plus, that would show them which side is actually the stronger market and where they should put a bit more of their focus), but they absolutely shouldn't turn the happy/fun Chuck E Cheese into that.
It would be a good idea but the only problem is that Scott isn’t allowing it because he fears that some sicko would be the real life William Afton and make a real life missing childrens incident. Reasonable fear due to the insanity people have to get clout.
This is exactly what CEC needs I knew it wasn’t cause of fnaf, I even heard from an Employee on the phone once she told me that keeping them in repair was just so expensive   CEC doesn’t know how to cater to 1 audiunce, it’s like YT, You can’t mix your content cause then YT won’t know how to recommend those videos to other people  I hope CEC really takes time to think it through, they need to understand that catering to a younger audience won’t last them forever  I hope they take a dip into the mature audience who loves this stuff, ur may just be able to save them💔
Fnaf x Chuck E. Cheese🎉🎉🎉
I was just at the facility where most of the Chuck E Cheese animatronics were made. Very cool place!
0:49 did Matpat just make a reference to TheRussianBadger?
The Chuck E. Cheese animatronics is more scary then FNAF animatronics💀💀💀
No joke I was eating Maltesers and had the letters i x i v/y It’s not very clear
Chuck E Cheese should've kept the animatronics. I think the problem is most of them weren't kept in good shape. They could've upgraded them with the robotics with have now and it'd be great!
TED NIVISON MENTIONED RAAAAHHHH🦅🦅🦅🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
"Wheelbarrel"
If i could afford it, i would buy a chuck e cheese location, get licensing to make it fnaf, upgrade the food, then pay ppl to dress up as the animatronics for after 9 as the scary horror location till 11 or midnight.
What they could do is make chuck e cheese avatars like abba and kiss and do the projection tech
I went to Chuck E. Cheese this week and I was wondering why they got rid of the animatronic Chucky and I was a little mad that they got rid of him because when I was younger, he used to be there now all they have is a dance floor and where Chucky used to be a screen Chuck E. Cheese him electronic with a green screen or a green screen screen
I'm amazed at how much business sense MatPat shows on food theory.
I would buy the new clothes but I already used all my money
3hr ago
Skee ball around here is so skewed you have to get every ball in the top 100 corner to get a prize now. People are just too good at the game.. But you look at the arcade market and they have been declining so much. I don't think I've even seen a place to just go play a pinball machine in my state.
I think about you day and night, Mathew Patrick.
Who framed Freddy Fazbear, coming soon to theaters.
FNAC THEORY GIMME NOW
I walked into a Chuck E. Cheese last year to pick up a Doordash order and turned toward the stage to see all the animatronics staring at me.
You should make an elegant collection for theory wear!! It would be a lot easier to style the clothes too!
Why did you hire models... It feels so commercial and disconnected plus I love seeing the team in the merch.
Nah, Chuck E. Cheese is just smarter than Fredbears Family Diner. When a child’s frontal lobe got bitten off in Fredbears Family Diner, they closed the restaurant, and opened a new one, with animatronics that could still bite off frontal lobes. When a child’s frontal lobe got bitten off at Chuck E. Cheese, they took down the animatronics, and they ain’t putting them back up.
11:40 sorry but Universal knows people don't like 3d stuff. The point seconds before you cut that video off has 2 FULL sized dinosaur animatronics in addition to one partial one that comes before. The old one in Orlando only has one T-Rex and its not even full size, its just a head.
I think scott has talked about how he wouldnt want a pizza place because ppl may try to recreate events from the games. This is different though so who knows.
I went to Chuckie Cheese with my kids BECAUSE of FNaF, not in spite of it. When they didn't have the animatronics, they were super disappointed. Chuckie should have leaned in to FNaF, not retreat from it. Free advertising for your terror palaces, and you decide, nah?
9:47- if you look closely he has long nails, mat is there somthing you need to tell us?
Congrats at 5M SUBS!!!!
Bro fnaf is rated 13+ now Tf is it 80%
That ending…possibly teasing a Five Nights At Candys theory, Mat?
Must’ve been hard to decide which channel to put this on.
Truth
Any one remember John’s incredible pizza
9:42 was matpat wearing long fingernails
Even on food theory matpat can't escape the "haur haur haur"
Maybe it wasn't Fnaf's faulty, but it is certainly more fun to say it is
Matpat needs to launch a channel where he discusses real life crimes and mysteries
whole answer in short: what killed chuck e cheese?.... Time
Nah, they were already dead before fnaf even started
You're gonna look me in my face and tell me you want a real Fazbear Frights?
My favorite local barcaid lets kids in on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, and they also have a really good non-alcoholic menu. So families will sometimes go there when it's more empty in the afternoons and have a really nice time playing all the old games. It's really cool.
I think more mature themed restaurants are a ting that would be awesome! One thing I think would be cool would be a DnD style fantasy tavern, with a wanted board full of strange characters, character actors, maybe a few puppets, and coming I'm character is encouraged. Just things like this built to feel like a real place from an imaginary location would be awesome!
chuck e cheese’s company really said, “I hope you die in a fire.”
Bro I remember listening to the five nights at candy’s 3 fan song and seeing Matratze include that game at the end was awesome
I wanted to have my 19th birthday there but you need 5+ kids for the party reservations. They could’ve easily adapted that to include older FNaF fans.
IMO, if they did make a FNAF-style eatertainment experience, I'd imagine it'd be a lot like the movie. The "animatronics" are actually guys in muppet suits, and during peak dining hours they close up the stage for supposed maintenance only for the stage to open up a few minutes later and reveal that one of the actors is just inexplicably gone.
Dude a creepy Chuck E Cheese would be awesome
I was the weird person of my groups when I was a kid. Still the same now. Horror stuff didn't freak me out. I found it fun, just not in the demented way. Ghost haunting? "That be fun to interact with a ghost." I remember going to see the 2000s Amityville horror movie (Ryan Reynolds) with my cousin and his friends. Two of them left the theater out of fear. They said they'd never go into an abandoned house, I said the movie made me want to do so more just for fun. They looked at me like I was a nutjobs. Some people REALLY don't know how to separate make-believe from the real world.
This was Scott's plan from the very beginning, he made the fnaf series out spite for chuck E cheese, and sabotaged their public image. (Joking)
You'd think that FNAF would actually make animatronics more popular and keep Chuck E. Cheese relevant, especially given the whole "Horror Games for Kids" mentality people like to joke about on the internet. Unfortunately, it really feels like the people in charge of the restaurant are stuck in the past and only have the slightest idea of what is currently popular and relevant. The economy is also a huge factor, since it costs more money to maintain robots, hence why we get projections and TV screens instead, like we're not living in a Jetsons-like world where robots are prevalent.  But this also makes me point out something nobody ever talks about, being the decline of places for people to go outside of their homes, like arcades, shopping malls, and movie theaters, all slowly vanishing because everything's online or can be accessed at home. There will eventually be a generation of kids that doesn't even know what these things are.  If anything, the thing that's killing Chuck E. Cheese is the internet, and the fact that the people in charge of the company (and most American companies) are still stuck in a pre-internet world, still stuck doing things like it's still the 1990's or early 2000's, and refusing to get with the times.
4:02 That is not Rockstar Freddy, editor!
It's honestly funny how cranky my mom gets when someone makes a joke about CEC's pizza. We loved it when I was a kid. But that was nearly 20 years ago now, so it's likely changed since then. But I suppose the brand loyalty still flows through our veins. We loved that place.  I still have a medal I got there. Probably just for my birthday, not getting a high score or anything. But I treasured that thing, and the memories it represented.
As a former Chuck E. Cheese cast member,ppl did in fact,come in just for the pizza lol  As for animatronics VS the animated stuff,I feel like the animated stuff on screen is gonna be lame. Animatronics look real because they physically are VS just seeing a video of something.
We really need a real life fnaf game place
Day 25 of trying mat pat to make a bubble guppies theory
One word: Springlocks
here is a theory will chuckie cheese be revamped into a FNAF building franchinse
Haven’t they already been getting rid of them for years?
Chucky cheese was a mistake.
7:24  I did. And i liked it, too.
You know, for a video that's from a channel focused on food, this wasn't so much on the food.  More like the substance of the animatronic entertainment business.  The food aspect is just the added sprinkles on top.
I would love a real-life Freddie's. But as a kid, I have been so scared of Chucky cheese since I was a child. I was uncomfortable just being there.
yo open up a fnaf location with animatronics see the money come in
ITS CHARLES ENTERTAINMENT CHEESE THE THIRD! For the last time, the first died in the war!
I so desperately want there to be a real Fazbers Pizzeria. It does not have to have lore or stuff like that. Be a normal-ish Chucky Cheese style restaurant that is painted to look like FNAF, and with some animatronics ofcorse. (No yellow suits. . . Yet)
I do not think that Fanf was inspire by Chuck E Cheese but heavily influenced by Showbiz pizza. Heck even back in the day before they all closed down there was rumors that they had missing kids in the restaurant. So, if you want to please check out Showbiz pizza.
i'm sure Hurriane Ian did not help either one of the chuckie cheeses down here in florida was destoryed by the hurriane and the whole building had to be demolished here in the daytona/port orange area.
Hoi4
Remember that Chuck E. Cheese was the actual main reason why FNAF happened in the first place. So I think the best thing Charles Entertainment could do is not only Collaborate Chuck E. Cheese with FNAF, but also possibly make a trip down memory lane to FNAF’s history and most Chuck E. Cheese’s history as well.
Something is up, chuck e. Cheese is had a competitor that had superior animatronics than it which sounds similar to when Henry was Williams competition, and chuck e. cheese combined there restaurant with the competitor just like what Henry and William did in FNAF, and we also got rock star Chucky, this can't just be random.
I LOVE fnaf fnaf was inspired by CEC and showbiz and i like both FNAF and CEC to.😊
Remembered folks all grown-up activities are just kid activities with lots of drinking, Close Enough thought us this.
Speaking of Chuck E. Cheese. You need to redo your video on their pizza. This is because the pandemic didn't allow indoor dining, which meant no recycled pizza
Chuck E. Cheese's having beer isn't a recent change; I accidentally drank my dad's beer (thinking it was apple juice) at my sixth birthday party, in 1992.
2 months later, we get Glamrock Chuck Entertainment Cheese.
S tier video
That described me almost perfectly. Sept 1 glaring thing. I am Gen. X. I Grew up in a period I might say that Horror was at its best. I would rather experience something. ETC.
To those that thought MatPat got a new finger tat and nail extension, that’s not him. It’s a female model trying on the same blazer.
I gots a question for peeps in the comments:  Did anyone else, as a kid, try to climb the stage to skin the animatronic band? Once I figured out they were "robots", I wanted to pull off the fabric covering and watch their mechanisms. Also, scare other kids.
I paused to read that "say this, not this" card, and man, is the "corporate" energy strong. I would actually respect the employees MORE for saying the "do not"s than the "do"s, especially that final one... yeesh, can it get more corporate? For those who didnt read it: "say this: 'Five Nights of Fun is not related to or in partnership with any company, brand, organization, or media outlet outside of Chuck E. Cheese.' Not: ' It's our take on Five Nights at Freddy's for Halloween!'". Kids are not going to sit still for that corporate "dont blame us" spiel, and adults are only going to hear "we are leaching off it despite our denial, but legally cant admit to it." Some of the "dont"s can slide as it is incorrectly stating an informal relationship as a formal one, but others would appeal more to both kids and adults because the former likes being heard and acknowledged as correct (kids are smarter than adults give them credit for), and the latter respects the honesty whilst getting tacit approval to geek out over the connection.
4:00 Rockstar Chuck E.? Hmmm……..  *PLEASE INSERT 5 COINS*
I am 32 and you bet I would go to fnaf themed restaurant (especially a Pizzaplex). I’ve been invested in this series since it came out in 2014
Hm, seems about right, i wonder how this will go?
Hi
So much for my dream idea of The Aquaricade (Mix of public aquarium and arcade)
14:35  well not to be that guy guy but Scott came foward and said that even if he had the chance he would never want to nake a fnaf restraunt beacuse he was afraid of some werdio trying to recreate the events of the game all of it
It could be so fun to see the fnaf horror attraction like the fnaf 3 game in real life
So the motol of the story is don't drink the rat a Grimes shake
the pain at being in Australia right now, ive just seen the clothing
Hey Chuck id listen to good old Matt Patt.. id go see it at least once😆
A FNAF themed Chuck E Cheese's? That would be awesome! To be perfectly honest, I'm surprised it hasn't happened already... Though, now that I think about it, maybe that is the reason Chuck and the gang have been taken down? Would be super cool is that theory proved to be true!
Why does Golden Freddy have top teeth in the thumbnail?
As a kid in the 90s the Chuck E Cheese animatronics were barely working and they were scary to me. Timeskip to now, and as someone who loves FNAF I would love to see a collab between FNAF and Chuck E Cheese. Heck I'm sure the kids going to Chuck E Cheese love FNAF
I remembered when during the Pandemic Chuck E Cheese had deals on their pizzas that made it affordable and still taste good. Could not beat getting 6 dollar pizzas and 3 dollars pretzel bites during Pandemic times.
we already have rockstar animatronics in fnaf. why did you feel the need to make the glamrock pun?? its literally already funny, you didnt need to change it.
My son doesn’t want to go to Chuck E Cheese anymore cuz of the FNAF (which he loves 😅)
prices for your merch is crazy
Well, I guess my dream of eating pizza at a Chuck-e-cheese and watching the animatronics is dead now.
let's admit, MatPat is a master of ad segues.
This also ties in with the film theory video today we want those cultural moments were everyones in on the joke like the grimace shake
Food theorists hitting 5 mil subs be like : 😎
I hope you statistics show when people skip your merch push. I skip it every time.
How is this about food?
14:03 and scott c. Fans think that it was  a war fnaf war
Fredrick Vs Charles would be fire
i feel like they did this so someone would commit an IRL missing children incident
Also take the amazing digital Circus for example   The show has cute/fun characted  but also a little dark. And that's why I enjoyed the fnaf movie for Horror and to laugh
Two rival restaurants, right next door to each other...  Krusty Krab and Chum Bucket?
13:54 "Don't say: 'Yeah, the characters look kind of similar, huh? Wait until you see them when we're closed! Whoa!'" I'd definitely be fired because this is exactly what I'd say to everyone.
Hearing that first part in the video is like the typical gen z behavior 😂 it’s so outlandish to hear
I feel a fnaf pizzeria would not be a good business strategy primarily because there are some sick people who would try to recreate the events of the franchise. Even Scott finds this a bad idea so i don’t see this EVER happening
Everyone try to send this to the Chuck E. Cheese ppl. I want a flippin fnaf pizzaria
Maybe children got stuffed into the costumes at chucky cheese
Ngl, it would be terrifying to see Chuck e Cheese rolling after you 💀
The irony is, Youtube itself is more of an "eatertainment" juggernaut... I'm literally eating my lunch and a bunch of doritos while watching this.
Why don't they just partner with Scott and make something special happen?  Edit: oh that was the point of the video XD  Well either way i would definitely go to a real Freddy Fazbear's pizza! Take my money!
the merch promotion is amazing and unexpecyed
I think he had some great points I hope they watch this and take it into consideration!
I think scott already said he would never approve a real freddy fazbear pizzeria because hes afraid someone might replicate the murders
congrats on five million subscribers guys!!!
Charleston Entertainment Cheese the 3rd the first two died in the war put some respect on the name
💀Bro needed to use toy chica 💀
Characters like dolly dimples and the mop characters that were mentioned in the video were made years before the showbiz pizza and pizza time theatre war that happened in the mid 80s Matt pat if you’re reading this please do more research before talking about stuff
I am the exception to the whole wanting to be scared and be immersed in the horror genre in general as well as the whole experience and objects thing.
I would love to see Chuck E. Cheese merge with FNAF and make Freddy Fazbear's Pizzaria a reality. I'd go there
NOOOOO I gotta go see my local Chuck E before he is removed :( Even though he's over an hour away...
Clunky cheese after watching this: 👻
EARLYYY
Under 1Mil Veiws 👇🏻
I think it pasttale's
Me
Lol
💀
I live in the uk and we dont really have anything like chuck e cheese here and ive always been fascinated by it, of course my fnaf obsession helped and when i went to america on a holiday i wanted to go so bad but i never got the chance. I just wanna see these historic animatronics before they’re gone for good 😔
The 2.0 remodels were not thought up till I believe 2014 or 2012
I agree
CEC x FNAF would be perfect. There are how many abandoned  CEC restaurants and probably plenty of old animatronics that can be repurposed. Since fnaf originally came out I became fascinated with animatronics and still am! I would totally go to a fnaf themed CEC
actually the 2.0 remodels were conceived at around 2014 in the middle of the 2010s
yes i would rather have a expensive car than a trip to jepan
11:00 why don’t they just move to using, I dunno, springlock suits? 😏
Someone please let this happen, I loved Helen as a kid.
!? How do I do that
?????????????????????????????????????????????????¿??????????
I am a Chuck e cheese fan and showbiz fan there is so much things Matt got wrong in this I have been a fan for ten years id like to say that the part of the video where he talks about reusing parts to make new animatronics that's not how that works at all the 3 stage Chuck e cheese animatronics are the retrofitted animatronics from showbiz pizza a company named creative engineering made those animatronics it would be hard to rebuild the frames of the 3 stage animatronics and cyberamics which are the chunkier looking ones they don't have the parts they use to because they stopped producing those parts
Rip rainforest cafe and restaurants similar to it so at this point the only types of restaurants that will exist at this point are barcades and restaurants with no entertainment in general aka boring, bland and conformist themed restaurants aka no more unique restaurants in general.😓😒😔🥺
?
MatPat, don’t you think Scott’s idea of William Afton and Henry Emily merging competing restaurants into one and progressing toward what we have know parallels Chuck E. cheese and Showbiz?
Just saying! That if I went to a CeC for a FNaF themed night! I would be sorely disappointed if they didn’t kick it off with the animatronics breaking down only for the puppets music box to start playing!! And I’m not even a big fan of horror I just enjoy the FNaF lore and content!
But won't the kid get bored from the same video game for years and what exercise and socializing?
I think that a team up between Chuck E Cheese and FNAF could work.
Yay they mentioned Top Golf! I am an Administrative Assistant at one :3.
True
Yes. Golden Freddy broke (literally) the fourth wall. Then came to reality. And stabbed a employee inside a Chuck e cheese suit in the leg and so goes on.   Conlusion: Yes, He/She/It killed him
Right.
Best quote ever, "one is for kids, and one is for GROWN UP KIDS" I was waiting for him to say adults and laughing while trying to cook my food
This is always good.
Good idea, Chuck E. Cheese should make a collaboration with FNAF so we can stop the entire madness that happened with it, we just wanted a real life FNAF restaurant so people can have a perfect experience of horror, but the negative thing is I’m worried if *PEOPLE WOULD RECREATE THE EVENTS FROM FNAF*
Video killed the radio star
the game five nights at chuck e cheese killed the Chuck E Cheese animatronics
Now hold on a minute  Chuck E. Cheese had a competitor that had way better animatronics and the two companies ended up merging into one with their animatronics?  sounds kinda familiar
bro forgot rockstar freddy
I would totally go!!!! Would be amazing!!!
143,155th viewer of this video!
Blud tryna remove Arcades and food, but keep the animatronics and close down places 💀(NO HATE)
I didn’t know people were saying FNAF has killed Chuck E Cheese. That’s hilarious and nonsensical, if anything I would imagine FNAF was actually boosting the popularity in asome small way.
I mean someone already has made a FNAF fan game with Chuck E. Cheese characters anyway.. they really should lean into it. My brother and his friends are OBSESSED with FNAF and they are in elementary school.
Within 3 hours!
Basically Chuck E. Cheese is like the Wii U . Tried to be appealing to everyone, but by doing that got no one's attention.
One of our local bowling alleys was bought by bolero and now it SUCKS
Fnaf wont save cec  yeah it got more people into cec but  fnaf was the final nail in the coffin for the show
No matter the reason, I think it's really sad that they're retiring the animatronics. Chuck e cheese was such a big part of my childhood and it won't be the same without them, even though I thought the animatronics were creepy back then
15:44 Was that Monster Rat?!
As someone who works at a Main Event as a technician, I can attest to the fact that maintanence and repair of attractions takes a lot of money, especially depending on what broke. If it's a lane, generally the parts are gonna be expensive due to the wear and tear they need to endure and how big they are, and with how pricey bowling is, they get paid for on that alone as bowling next to dining and scheduled events are the big money makers. Games on the other hand have to pay for themselves due to their high initial cost, and make their revenue based on who plays them throughout the day via game cards or tokens. If a part on a game breaks down, the cost of the part comes from how much it makes, so if a coin pusher breaks a motor, and the motor is $130 and the game makes $1000 a week, than it's an easy buy. If a shooter game has its gun break down and the gun is $900 but the game makes $500 a week, it's a lot harder to justify keeping the game, especially if its an old one. Another example would be if te game promotes a gimmick that contributes nothing to gameplay and is purely fun/cosmetic, if thst breaks down and te revenue the game brings in isn't enough to justify fixing the gimmick but the game works regardless, than it can be left operable just without that flashing light, more so if the gimmick continuously breaks. I imagine with big animatronic characters this kind of logistics is applied even more so, as they are an attraction but don't necessarily bring in their own revenue, they're just for show like a tv and rely on what the resturant earns to keep their upkeep in check.
FNAF is taking over
lol this is the exact kind of video I wanted from you, honestly great stuff man ❤️
an irl fnaf resterant would be insane
if chuck e cheese became a freddy fazzbear/amusement park i would definitely be there every weekend
I mean, I don't think GT's first FNAF theory helped at all
Dang only 20 minutes ago and this many views and comments 😳
Since FNAF 3 Takes place in 2023 they should make a collab and open Fazbear Frights
“Ah food theory! Bon apatite.” Is one of the most funniest things I’ve heard Mattpatt say.
Remember Five Nights of Fun?
I didn't like Chucky Cheese anyway. Good video,Mat.
Maybe because like five or three kids disappeared there.
Did matpat just make a russian badger reference?
I forget where this quote is from but it goes something like this, "It is best to appease the few then it is to appease the many. It 'a dangerous trying to appease the many"
bruh and creepy
The removal of chuck e cheese animatronics might allow room for another animatronic based pizza place **caugh** **caugh** but who knows Edit: after watching the video i 100% agree with matpat
what if they buy and sell the merch
So Chuck E. Cheese needs lore. Something to keep people interested and coming back. Among other things I really agree with in this video
If they are you to make fnaf real, it would it follow the design of omega mart in my opinion: where the main attraction is the pizzariai; but they could hide secret rooms and stuff around the restaurant so that it becomes more interactive. Like a haunted house sore of attraction.
I for one am extremely excited for the Chuck E Cheese pizzaplex
Golden Freddy at 14:35
Retheming their animatronics to give a horror experience would definitely be a bigger draw than dancing/music (plenty of other options for that). I think they should have attempted to adapt to that angle no later than 4 or 5 years ago. It might be too little too late now...they could even keep the face of the franchise (Chuck) as kind of the 'good guy' character trying to protect the kids from his robotized friends.
Those animatronics have always been creepy and off-putting. Why they kept them around this long is beyond me.
I just heard about this. Crazy
How did he decide this to be on food theory  Cause the claim is the fnaf movie which could go under film theory but fnaf is also a game so it could go under game theory too
Give us more GTLIVE THEORY WEAR!!💚
bro i think they barely used the animatronics for entertainment lol
I love how the “bite of 87” is the meme… and in the games it’s like an anecdote?.. the bite of 83 seems to be the “big one” but teh memes..
In people want to be immersed they’re in luck, because a FNaF dark ride is currently in development. Look it up.
5:57 yep real life mega pizza plex
Actually inspired by showbiz pizza I think
Going from this weeks film theory to this is giving me whiplash
Seriously! Turn all Cuck E Cheeses into creepy Barcades and we will all win.
So if disney didn't exist chuck e cheese would notexist and if chuck e cheese didn't exist fnaf would not exist and if fnaf did not exist then mattpat would have a day off
Been saying this since fnaf 3, agree wholeheartedly even still.
HARR HARR HAR HAR HAR HAR
So not sure if your already making a theory video right now but matpat there is a youtube short flim that I have been enjoying for a while now called "Im a pebble' made by CGMeetup I thought you should make a video on film theory since I found some bits of lore hiddin within some of the senses.  spoiler about it The story is mostly talking about some type of isolation and or lonelyness with the main character being an otter named bubble. letting you know it's an OTTER not anything else.   side note keep up the great work you never fail to disapoint us :)
This change has been coming for a while at our CeC you could tell when they virtualized the cast but more and more have just played kids bop.

Explanation: the locks in the suit are very tight so when actors acted, people starting falling over and having to take a hospital trip. So people got mixed up with animatronics with acting suits, so actors declined jobs for acting as they thought they would fall over and Mabye die. Meaning, chuck and his friends had to be removed (also probs bc of five nights at fun)
I think that's an interesting idea but I think they won't do it since it's a irreversible change, you can change chuck form a rollerblader to a rockstar but the horror figure it's irreversible and it will change the image of the company too much and in a way that they can't do a 180
Wait, Isn't Round Table Pizza An Eatertainment?
I was a 90s baby and was lucky enough to see two animatronics shows as a kid. My kid really wants to go to Chuck E. Cheese for his next birthday because he’s obsessed  with animatronics but I told him I wasn’t sure they even still had them since they don’t show up in any of the promos.
main event=freddy fazbears mega pizza plex, ngl they should merge for halloween,
15:38 YOU DID NOT JUST do thag
Charles had to think if Fnaf was a menace or an opportunity for the business, and seems the analysis came out with it being seen as menace.
1:39 what about Jasper?
And what would be even better is if they also included lore IRL, making what happens in the real world canon in the pre-existing parts of the franchise.
Wasn’t that Chuck E. Cheese card for the fnaf stuff fake?
The thumbnail is different then the thumbnail someone on the subreddit got  Is this an experiment?
I can’t wait for Scott to release a lore-filled clothing line so that FNaF can invade Style Theory too.
I would love a fnaf themed chuck e cheese.
Man i freaking miss chuck e cheese, wish it was still around me :(
Lethal Company arg
My 4 yo niece is into indi horror. I don’t know why but she is.
I feel they could jsut take Chuck's oldest original design and just repurpose it as his grandfather at this point.
3:55 I do hate the Glamrock name😂. The fact that there is a Rockstar AND a Glamrock Freddie. And they're TWO DIFFERENT ANIMATRONICS
oholero de freddy fazber
I hate how the vilification of Adult only and Child only spaces has lead to “The whole family can come!” spaces that just don’t work, because adults and kids don’t want to mix together. Adult spaces shouldn’t allow children, and child spaces should only allow adults if they’re keeping their own kids safe.
Chuck E Cheese fangame time
Me who just got home from a b-day at chucky chesse
Yes, sadly
Im allergic to cheese, so I never ate at a chuck e cheese but went regularly. So its always confusing to me when people refer to the place as a restaurant.😂 My whole childhood, it was always an Arcade first to me.
No. Chuck E. Cheese just sucks as a company
JUST MAKE MATPAT THE CEO OF CHUCK E CHEESE
5 kids went missing at a Chuck E Cheese and parents reported smells…
If smth creepypastas, 3 AM videos & garten of banban tell you its that kiddies like soft horror too
E
I have a Question........... Why DOES THE LAZER TAG AREA IN MAIN EVENT LOOK LIKE FAZERBLAST FROM FNAF SB AND WHY DOES EVERYTHING ELSE LOOK LIKE IT..... My question prob fits the Answer 5:48
I used to go to chuck e cheese until I found out what John’s incredible pizza is so I started going there instead
I thought FNaF was inspired by Showbiz
The lore of chuckle cheese is almost parallel to the fnaf lore! To the point the company behind chuckies, drove another business with better animatronics out of business after years of legal battles of patent infringement. Like the relationship with afton and henry
We're waiting every night to finally step closer to, the big mouse that has been suspiciously copying us for so many years we've been all teased they think they can get away, but they can't lock us through those doors, they think they can but they wont until the    27th we fought back we now know they are what we're thinking, we're a community trapped in our little wiki against charles e cheese five nights at freddys. Is this who you want to protect I just dont get it. Is this where you want to stay Five nights at freedys is this who you want to protect i just dont get it is this who you want to protect five nights at freddys oh....
Skater Chucky will always be my Chucky.
a
Is probably because people are making less and less money to go to these places
Ok
Good nice movie
For years? Sure, if it's a 90's game. If it's a modern game, it'll continue to cost you, and then on top of that it'll be replaced once a year, so an annual cost on top of the microtransaction costs.
Honestly the animatronic (just one) freaked me out (cause the Chucky cheese I go to only has Chucky so)
14:40 - yeah then they capitalize on it with the last of tech they already have without much expenses and move on to the next thing with profit in disposing old things. because they do can capitalize on that but it won't last long.
3:58 *_Rockstar Freddy has left the chat_*
I think FNAF renewed interest in Chuck E Cheese. It’s was nostalgic for an older generation, and they only let adults in with kids.
It lurks in the shadows, out of His spotlight, His view. He dances on the stage, weaving a web of lies. But you must venture beyond the cage, and find where It cries. Find the truth.
The point he made about barcades is true the location I go to kick kids out at 9pm so its adult only and for someone In education it's a safe space
I’m pretty sure I heard about them getting rid of the animatronics and replacing them with dance floors a few months before this movie even came out.
My thing is they already did that back in 2014
Mat still thinks video games only cost 50 dollars? I wish
They should just partner with FNAF, change the name to Fasbear's and design the animatronics to break down
Joke's on you MatPat, I actually go to Chuck E Cheese for the pizza
I thought the reason they were doing away with the animatronics was because they were seen as scary. Think about it, fnaf focuses around scary animatronic. Is it possible that the big wigs at Chuck E. Cheese’s saw the fnaf games and started wondering if maybe their animatronics were scary to kids?
I went out with my friends to watch the fnaf movie and there’s a Chuck E. Cheese like right there near the theater- I joked with my friends about how we should go there for five nights of fun after the movie
As a engineering major, it is sad to see the decline of animatronic, that was part of the reason I wanted to become an engineer.
Mat Pat you're missing a big problem, what happens if the new generation no longer wants to have a horror, but Chuck E cheese is all in on horror
4:00 not to mention the Rockstar animatronics
The Help Wanted 2 hippo is even closer.
Fazbear frights??
Scott needs to be ready to buy them out
Hi matpat!
Nah, Chuck E Cheese probably started FNaF, being that Chuck E Cheese was always creepy af
12:09 what killed chuck e. cheese ad: OPREA GX 🤣
See me personally I love Hard Rock Cafe and want to go to all of them but that might just be me
well actually i would love to have a new pair of 4s
This entire theory is based off the idea that Chuck E. Cheese only recently made the decision to remove the animatronics from their locations, and within the first 20 seconds you’ve already made a flimsy theory because you didn’t do as much as 2 seconds of research regarding the removal of them. This project has been ongoing for a few YEARS now, and is NOT something recent. A couple years ago the first light up dance floor was installed at a Chuck E. Cheese location as a test towards whether or not it would draw in more children towards the demographic they were intending. Ultimately the tests seem to have worked as they’re finally rolling it out elsewhere, but it literally has nothing to do with the release of the FNAF movie.  The animatronics in general have not been well maintained in recent years due to general neglect and disinterest in them by children (besides of course the FNAF children), so of course the best course of action to try and save their declining business would be to replace it with something more modern and entertaining for children.  Chuck E. Cheese has been struggling financially since before the FNAF games were even released, and even then animatronics were not popular with most people. So the implication that an indie game entirely changed the medium of entertainment they’re using in their shops is ridiculous.
"tries to appeal everyone and satysfies no one" its a perfect way to sumyries everything in modern enterteiment
Pretty sure they've been phasing out the animatronics for quite some time now. Pretty sad really, the whole place feels so empty now.
12:07 there are rockstar animatronics in fnaf 6 you could have used
It would be funny if at some point the Chuck E Cheese animatronics come back for some haunted house type attraction inspired by FNAF making it come full circle.
i don't want this in any capacity
But I there for pizza
UK needs some animatronics.
( PLOT TWIST ) they were afraid someone will stuff kids inside them
Never been to a Chuck E Cheese (or Showbiz Pizza) as they never existed anywhere near me.  Closest thing to an animatronic I ever saw was a "talking" cow I think in Nova Scotia, but it just discussed the dairy process and didn't play music. Lazy cow!  As for barcades - we had one open downtown a year or two ago. Sadly, the restaurant that was up on the second floor had a fire which destroyed BOTH businesses.  The nearest barcade is now a 2 hr drive away in a neighbouring city.
Im going there today
You know FNAF has messed you up when Matpat tells the story of a real guy and you treat it like a lore theory.
Search Chuck e Chesse brawl, then you will know why it is a dying brand.
Mr. Patrick, what you just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response, were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul!
Love the content. Fascinating
so THIS is why Gattitown is withering away while Malibu Jacks is just absorbing the entire plaza it's in.
But I WANT something made from 100% recycled animatronic XD
My god even when your not talking about fnaf you still Mention it it’s like once you get popular over something it just manages to just slip into videos
NOOOOOO, NOT THE TOPGOLFS!!
As someone who works at a hard rock i can guarantee you that hard rock is not suffering at all 😂😂 as long as there are gamblers/ gambling addicts, the hard rock will not be going anywhere
1:03 Where An Adult In His 30s Can Be A Kid
Um....That isn't what they announced at all.  If you have paying any attention they have been in the process of removing the animatronics from stores for 5 years snd they were going to discontinue them entirely until their announcement that they were going to have them in one venue that fans could travel to see and enjoy them in.  In fact they seemed to suggest they might reintroduce the animatronics in a few other locations in different regions
"A brand killing itself of"  Soo... Suicide?
Sadly the digital experience with rides makes them ultra boring.   If I want to watch a digital projection of a movie scene...Ill stay home and watch the movie.  The rides shown are cheaper to make/maintain but theres nothing in them to awe people.
I thought this as well when I heard the news, guess we share the same mind
oh my god HOW DOES IT HAVE THE SAME BACKSTORY AS FNAF???
Honestly thought that FNAF would have made Chuck E Cheese more popular  (Still watching)
oof
😅
The bigger question is if we're gonna get a FNAF themed restaurant
Make clothing for pets!
want to be scared.... if I wait for it to happen, i can't be scared...
All I have to say,               Har har har.
Man I really want a colab like this to happen. maybe it will be with FNAF's 10th anniversary and the FNAF 2 movie on it's way. Chuck,E and Scott got a lot of potential with this one :D
Me: tries to enjoy a food theory video  Mat-Pat: (shamelessly plugs his new merch that i already know about)
Id still like to believe Freddy and the gang stormed into Chucky Cheese Pizza and absolutely beat the metal out of Chucky
Fnaf is everywhere
As someone from Britain; no chuck e cheese here. I only knew about chuck e cheese because of FNAF
Not making something appealing to one audience is the reason disney is failing with marvel movies
id for sure go out of my way to go to a chuckecheese place if it rebranded to horror, I don't care much for any childish restaurants
Now style theory has to talk about fnaf
As someone who doesn't like to leave home, I'd rather spend money on useful material goods and my hobbies. The main exception to that is sports. I'm always down to go watch the sports teams from my favorite college compete...especially their wrestling team. In fact, this season's wrestling national championships will be kinda close to home, so I'm planning to go with my son and his family. Obviously I left the decision to bring my young grandson up to his parents. They know it's a 3 day event, but they think he can handle it. I'm all for it because I think it will be a cool experience for him. It's always fun sharing something you love with your children and grandchildren.
Make more chuck e cheese stuff I love it
When did MatPat stop using the original food theory intro?
i will sell my entire life for the mopsey sisters
i will sell my entire life for the mopsey sisters
I think the main mistake a lot of "family friendly" companies are making is that they put way too much focus on being unoffensive to the parents. Theyre so careful not to give the parents any reason to *not* bring their kids to their restaurants, that they completely neglect to give the *kids* any reason to *want* to go in the first place. Would a FNAF event at Chuck E Cheese upset some parents? Sure. But kids would be *begging* to go check it out, and that would drum up so much more business than theyd potentially lose
*WAS THAT THE BITE OF 87??!?!* 0:09
They should make it big on new fnaf-mini game style arcade and gain traction through influencers trying to solve the mysteries at the restaurants
i will sell my entire life for the mopsey sisters
Candy's IS part of the FNAF franchise. Getting a FNAC crossover would also require the approval of Scott. Also, even if you weren't aware of that detail, then there would still be the implication that CEC would be allowed to use a FANGAME character without the approval of the creator of the franchise the fangame was made for in the first place, which is arguably just plagiarism.
Chuck E Cheese lore is REALLY similar to the FNAF timeline lol
The one near me turned into a dance floor in like 2017, so I think it might just be something that they tested and are spreading to more locations
After hearing this, I so badly want them to switch into a horror restaurant.
What was the music at the end called?
Lol I'm watching this in a airplane😂
Honestly the own shout out that matpat is doing is a bit much
Cl😮
Matpat kinda clickbaited us with fnaf
Fnaf and matpat going to bring back chuck e cheese
*YOU HAVE NOW BEEN BLOCKED BY CHUCK E CHEESE INC*
This what needs to happen for me to go to chucke cheese
Umh this really wouldnt work just beacause of 1 thing: crazy people redoing the events of the games. (like the children incident)
Who man
1 hour gang 👇
Definitely agree with the thoughts about Rainforest and Dave & Busters. I went to a Rainforest Cafe in Orlando in 2015, and I felt like I paid more for the, objectively bad, experience of having to yell across the table to talk to people, as opposed to the food. Dave & Busters used to have fun arcade games when I was growing up, but they've been replacing them with oversized versions of mobile apps.
A disco chucky cheese sounds alright
I don’t know if FNAF killed Chuck E. Cheese in those exact words, but I think the “Five Nights of Fun” the latter did and the posters looking all too alike didn’t do them any favors
Bro Imagine if Five Night's at Candy's had its own location before FNaF  🤣😭💀   (I'd be totally down for it)
And he’ll be savaged as “Scrap Chuck E”
i thought chuck e cheese went bankrupt in 2020
Looks to me like the Stage has been set for a new contender in Children's Entertainment
4:00 matpat: no not glamrock it's rockstar  Fnaf SB: yo six! Fnaf six: grrrrrrrr
evil troll
Growing up we definitely considered th creepy already lol.
I also wish that CEC Entertainment could have fully leaned into the FNAF ambience and even gone so far as to program the animatronics with specific responses to specific names. Take my name, for example: Vanessa. "Well, happy birthday, Vanessa! Vanessa... I knew a little girl named Vanessa. Once..." Cassie/Cassidy - "Cassie? Cassie... Happy birthday, Cassie! Say, how do you feel about carrot cake?" Gregory - "Gregory... Why does that name sound familiar?" Charlie - "Well, hello Charlie! You'd best stay close to Mom or Dad now, okay? We don't want you all by yourself." Jeremy - "Oh, wow! We actually get a lot of people named Jeremy in this establishment, did you know that?" Elizabeth - "Elizabeth... How would you like some ice cream, Elizabeth? Consider it on the house." Michael - "Happy birthday, Michael! Play nice with the other children!" Evan - "Well, I hope you're ready for one super-duper party, Evan! Because today, it's all for you!"
Honestly the fact that chucky cheese removed all of the animatronics from the restaurants Means that fnaf did a good job.
MatPat: Let say I'm a parent...  Me: Aren't you already a parent?
There is a place in my hometown called Huckleberry Junction that had been around for over 45 years. Has always gave Showbiz/ Chuck E Cheese healthy competition when it came to entertaining kids and Adults
When you see a chucky cheese video you know he’s going to talk about fnaf
If anything, Chuck E. Cheese is killing themselves
Ok but I have a lot of fond memories of Chuck E. Cheese as a kid and I will be pretty sad if I won’t be able to take my kid there one day because they rebranded to horror. Not everyone liked that sort of thing
µ is a letter, not DIVID DIS BY 1 MILLON
How did I just watch the view/click count update real-time?
While I do not wish to be spooked, I DO want to go to an actual Fazbears and would happily travel and pay for that, yeah. Kind of hoping for a ride at Universal though, safe space with lots of security so people don't do dumbshit, and the VR games already have an on tracks shooter they can use as inspiration.
The chuck-e-cheese near me got rid of this stuff years before. Like 2020 or maybe even before. They never really used the animatronics and the person in the suit came out a lot more. Fact is they started doing this years before COVID and the FNAF movie.
What is with the thumbnail?
Proof that Faz-Bear Entertainment is rich.
Why did this one just not have a thumbnail
please more outcore on GTLive!!!!!
AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT GETS SO EXCITED WHEN I SEE ANYTHING FNAF RELATED ON ALL THE THEORY CHANNELS?!
Calling the machines at Chuck E. Cheese "Arcade games" is a very loose definition.  The majority of the machines they have are simplistic and, arguably rigged, ticket machines.  It's no wonder barcades have soared, they actually have real arcade games... and alcohol.   Think of what Showbiz Pizza was before they bought and OG Chuck E. Cheese, they had hard core arcade games, well at least mine did.  I used to go to Dave and Buster's because of the arcade games, but they transition and focused more on ticket machines and I stopped going.
Chuck E Cheese didn't recently announce they were removing them, they announced it a few years ago, and have destroyed alot of them already, it only now got into mainstream media because they decided to keep them at one location due to a Petition a kid started
Just as a quick note about the Mickey cartoon ride, I do find the idea of actual cartoons being timed to simpler physical things happening (and even your own interaction maybe, I don't know, I haven't been on it) to be a much more fun and immersive idea than any kind of animatronics
That’s so fascinating that people in my generation would rather spend money on cool experiences than cool things. I fit into that category but I’m not sure why. Is it the anticipation of the experience that gives you  longer lasting joy?
Bruh this is a 10 yr old rumor, sounds like a clickbait vid
Lets go matpat
Mat I LOVE chuck e cheese pizza. Please stop with the pizza slander. I literally just go with my younger family members just for the pizza.  🍕
Chuck-E cheese fans: FNAF KILLED CHUCK-E CHEESE.          FNAF fans: chuck-e cheese profited and copyed off of FNAF
I’ve been saying to my friends for years that they should do a real Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, where it’s what Henry intended the restaurant to be by day, but by night it’s a FNAF IRL experience like the Game Lab episode!
This video made me cry multiple times
The next freddy animatronic will me a dance floor I'm calling it oh yeah also there is gonna be chuck cheese frights
I am not even kidding, I mean this so wholeheartedly: as a 29 year old, full grown, adult woman; if a franchise opened up that was based around five nights at Freddy's and heavily Five Nights at Freddy's themed Not only would I go, I would probably be a regular
i love that a video with fnaf is in the food theory channel
Camel city BBQ for life😊
Tbh i believe Chuck E Cheese is just jealous
Finally be gone demons
If you cast too wide a net, you'll catch nothing.
Five nights at candys rat at the end
We got FNAF killing chuck e cheese before GTA 6
8:02  Also the main event as the best game records I've ever had most juicy amazing hamburgers ever you're so good that you almost wonder if they're actually beef in fact yes they are but they're just so amazingly juicy that they're just they're amazing and that's not just because I worked here and I was saying that I would ultimately believe at Like
Somehow Fnaf finds its way to the food theorist channel lol
A robotic rat isn’t going to capture the attention of more mature and technology savvy kids with IPads.
Scott said he would never make a real restaurant because he was afraid someone would try to remake the murders
This is a food game theory cross 0ver?
Honestly this makes me feel like a outlier in this cause as a child i loved chuck é cheese pizza the Hawaiian pizza was amazing at my closest location but its too expensive to go regularly so it became more of a birthday option for me. Then when i got too old i leaned more into my parents birthday love benihanna where i always loved the food and atmosphere but again too expensive to just go regularly. To this day i can only really go to benihanna on birthdays where multiple birthday coupons can lower the price enough
Eh, not rlly. Corp is just making the stores look worse and more and more fandom members are leaving.
Skater chucky is the best version of chucky
784th!!
Eatertainment is on the decline? Well, so much for my FNAF-inspired Animatronic Pizzeria, Pete's Pizza. Guess I'll have to retire the dream of making that a reality. At least I'll still have the characters.
7:31  Is somebody who personally works at main event is nowhere near losing money really hardly I mean they might lose money everyone's in wild but their customers are just way too loyal people are way too nice and main event just there's no ways it mean event doesn't have oil customers that stick around big time I know cause I personally work in a main event in Kentucky
STOP WITH THE EFFING FNAF VIDEOS, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD
Matpat, you realise if you’re right the fnaf lore will span three channels? Can your sanity handle that? Is this what you want?
"FOOD THEORY, 'Where an adult in his 30s can be a kid'" 💀💀💀
ehem McDonalds counts as eatainment since in my local McDonalds they have iPads attached to the tables wich u could play games on and they have playplaces and they have similar things to barcades just no arcades and no sports bar but still
Here before 1 hour
Come on Matpat, I know a thneed when I see one.
Nah this was a coincidence. I worked at a Chuck e. Cheese about 2 years ago. They were talking about it then. And was breaking down about how they were doing it.
Uh, CEC has always served alcohol though, that isn't a recent thing. Also, I will have you know that I AM going for the pizza, they actually have pretty good pizza at some locations. I always liked going in, getting some pizza, watching a Studio C Alpha Chuck perform and then maybe checking out the prizes to see if it was worth playing any games. A nice day out is just not the same as playing a game at home. Going out lets you spend time with others and make memories, playing a game alone just isn't anything special. But yes, for years they have been skipping out on partnering with FNAF, when we have all been saying for years that at Halloween, they should really be doing a FNAF event. If the resurgence in people visiting CEC because they were into Fnaf back in 2014 and 2015 wasnt enough of a clue to them, I don't know what would get them to understand. But it still deeply saddens me that CEC is DESTROYING their bots instead of putting them in like storage or a museum like they said they would.
They've been trying to do this for a really long time they are just executing it now it's just a coincidence in timing it maybe is because of the original game but not because of the movie they've been wanting to  Remove the animatronics since like 2014
E
Yay i love this vid
My theory is that FNAF is the chuck E cheese of that universe and that chuck E cheese could of happened but afton and his partner came out before them
5 mil. Subs
i would love a fnaf restaurant irl and ik so many ppl who would, even if it was just a few locations people would definitely create a lot more traffic there is chuck e. cheese merged with fnaf
Nuh uh
main reason is Cec's parent company is awful for everything they did to the animatronics and they removed them to cut corners
Meanwhile disney still has outdated animatronics… i feel like their next for a change
5:50 when you listed those off i just paused and went "wait a minute that sounds familiar"
Thing is, I think Chuck could still make it if they KEPT their animatronics. The issue isn’t FNAF, it’s that the old animatronics haven’t had any design updates really since their inception. If they used new technology not only for their food but for their Animatronics they really could have Disney Imagineer level animatronics that aren’t scary to kids.
He right. I think FNAF saved Chuck e cheese. They just shouldn't worry about kids running away from them because it's too scary. If you can see a 3 year old playing these scary games without crapping themselves. Then you're obviously fine.
honestly I just find this funny
Let’s go I am in for minute
If Chuck E. Cheese made a Fnaf style night or event, me and my children would be there opening day.
No chuckle cheese is still going hard, just took my 5 year old for his birthday it was packed. Did pay 17.99 for 5 burnt popcorn chickens and some fries tho.
i live in Florida so i dont need the stuff sorry
Under a hour gang! 👇
actually trying to make my own restaurant
Well Fnaf just said it is not the best idea
If corporation's would listen to the public feedback instead of listening to the heads of marketing and their feedback and ignoring the public, companies like this would not even have any issues financially
That would neber happen. Scott literally said he doesn't eant a recreation of FNAF in real life where kid's dead bodies are stuffed in  animatronic suits. Ge doesn't want copycat criminals. It would never happen
CHARLES ENTERTAINMENT CHEESE BABYYYYYY
Matt they planed this since  the first time went bankrupt
Mat how do i scan the merch QR code if im watching on my phone 😂❤
Is...mat wearing fake long nails in his northern lights sponsor bit, where he's wearing the blazer? Or is he holding a something?
Thank you, please let Chuck E. Cheese become IRL FnaF you guys at CEC
Freddy and his Frends has taken over
Meanwhile, here we still waiting for an Animatronic restaurant to even exist, and in the US they kickin them out. No success means no restaurant for us in Europe.   Another point: They could use it to their advantage if they do a FNAF-like experience actually, this type of restaurant simply does not exist in Europe, so they could feed on tourists, visiting the restaurant because of the lag of animatronic restaurants here.  Still sad this is not a part of my childhood memory =(
the true theory fact is that Chucke cheese is copying fnaf with five nights of fun! they didn't even allow any staff to say anything about fnaf!
did u do something wrong cuz this vid is on food theory or maybe you just but it on food theory cuz they sell pizza idk
Nooo main event is so much fun 😢😢
check five nights at chuck e cheese's rebooted it is a great combo of FNAF and chuck e cheese
Places like that I look at one thing, that for my household, is a big one. Pay to play ratio. The more plays they can get per dollar, the better.
They have the makings of a perfect escape room. Lean into that experience then update the menu making it both simpler and better quality for a bite to eat after. Go all in on the 16+ side
@15:43  Seriously. . . Why would CEC's Team up with a Fan-game like FNAC?!! After all; The Fazbear Fanverse Initiative & the fangames within it isn't as Mainstream as the Franchise that Started it all; aka Scott Cawthon's Five Nights at Freddy's!
Man, I was planning on recreating the bite of 83
Here before an hour
Piggy or brawl Stars please day 1
Really... someone is missing a massive opportunity here.... Literally all the success of the FNAF franchise and their response is to just do away with their creepy animatronics!? Come on guys.... try harder.... The obvious choice is to rebrand and create adult horror themed animatronic restaurant experiences for all of us unstable millennials.... but also... make it affordable since we are all poor too.
Chuck' eche'eese and fnaf should collab amd make fnacf(five nights at cheesy freddys)
Chuck e cheese failed at the start of the 2000s .. either prizes became cheap ... Or games become rigged so good prizes couldn't be won
As someone who doesn't have Chuck E Cheese where I'm from but grew up seeing it in media, I hope it doesn't go down the drain so I can go someday
The most interesting thing in this video is at the 12:46 mark he showed items that people like, and one of them was a Megumin doll from Kunosuba, which is a very under rated anime. Good going MatPat.
Rockstar Chucky is still a rip on fnaf 6
I'm a simple man, I see matpat talking about fnaf and I click
What's your cats name?
Considering their recent rebrand attempts, If the final thesis isn't along the lines of "Maintenance costs required to keep them functional in a generation where the skill required is in short supply, jacking those costs up, meaning the animatronics get busted and neglected and sit there in the location slowly rotting - making it a wise money-saving business move to just cut them all out together"  I will be shocked.  That said, it seems self-defeating, as one of the big reasons they exist was the video and carnival games of the 80s-00s, animatronics and sprawling playscapes.  What do most locations have now?  Animatronics gone, Arcades and Playscapes downsized and significantly less fun.  I'm pretty sure The Cheese killed itself by not being able to keep up with the market, and CoViD accelerated the process.  FNAF is just an easy excuse, which probably would drive more business if they could manage the animatronics better.
My local chucky cheese already did this in 2018
The only thing I disagree with is that Chuck E Cheese doesn’t market for “everyone” they market to parents and their kids  When your catch phrase is “where a kid can be a kid” and has a reputation for subpar food, myself (and other young adults without children like me) wouldn’t ever think to go there unless one of my younger family members has a birthday party there  And if I really wanted to see Chuck E Cheese for nostalgia I could find videos online   My family actually made a pit stop there years ago for a easy meal while we going on another trip (with my younger step sisters getting coins to play the games) and I immediately noticed that all the games were sized to be for small children so if I even wanted to play a game out of boredom while waiting for our food I wouldn’t even be comfortable
Five nights at Chuck E Cheese
4:02 why did glamrock freddy show up when a freddy called rockstar freddy exists
building off the target demographic thing, i find more value in paying 40$ to take me and my friend into a club than 40$ to get me and my child into chuck e cheese (hypothetically, I don't have kids) if kids had money like that then chuck e cheese would have more business because the people they target would have money. makesure your target demographic has the money for what your selling.
Claim your here within an hour ticket
Matt unless you're giving you're kid gta5 online no game is going to entertain him for years but I know a Paw Patrol game that will he'll enjoy for a week
Share this with Chuck E Cheeses!!!!!!!!!
How is this a food theory?
.
Hahahahha
It's all fun and games until this actually happens and some kids die lol
662th comment
Dude Chuck E. Cheese becoming a fnaf horror restaurant would be so cool. Pretty cool video!
13:03 Matthew Patrick you forgot to include my middle age mom who I dragged to the theatre with me/lh
MatPat sounds like he has a cold But hey that's just a theory
11:45 there's a whole nother deep dive and retrospective that we can take with that topic...😅
Food theory idea: why do shopping karts tend to have a squeaky forth spinning wheel
MAKE MORE CHUCK E CHEASE VIDS😊
I think eatertainment should go the other way around. Like Japanese karaoke joints or love hotels, snacks are just extras to the main thing.
but I am still hate the new chuck e cheese looks the anvager is nice an cute then the new creepy looks the new looks it  little creepy  an don't let me get started with  spgully  the chief  but jasper t jowls we be came friend he is like to make sure I am very safe in chuck e cheese  and he give a pig back rid on me wen I was a kid back then  and Helen the haney try to give me a hug and I was hind under the birthday tables from afrte was looking for me  and I run to jasper  t jowls from that crazy chicken  and mr much seared the day lights out of me and run to my dad an holding hand an start creeping in tires
Easier to understand then fnaf? Not exactly impressive. Most things are easier to understand then fnaf
Too bad Scott cawthon said he’d never make a real fine nights at Freddy’s, because he’s worried someone might do a “purple guy”.
there was a collab between chuckicheese and fnaf. Like 5 days prior to the movie they had you buy their pizza. And potentially win fnaf tickets.
*sees rat dude from 5 nights at candy's* OOOOH
He's so lucky don't talk about enough without getting copyright because he was in the movie he's amazing This is not a Theory this is a channel
❤my local Chucky cheese became a wine and spirits store Wich is kinda fitting
Ironically an actual Freddys restaurant would probably be a hit.
15:00 I’m sorry, why do you have Og Freddy, Rockstar Bonnie, Toy Chica, and Og Foxy? In what world does that group make sense? I don’t mean to be rude, I’m just trying to understand the thought process here. Did the editor who made this, not know a few things about Fnaf? If so, how?! They have Mat as a boss and they don’t have this stuff drilled into their skulls? I suppose ignorance is bliss.
The cupcake did it
Watching this at 2 am on a school night
W MattPat 1:05
Everything he touches turns to FNAF
Epic rap battles of history, Freddy Fazbear vs Chucky Cheese
Another new lit video from the theorist himself, but thats just a theory,
We GOT ANOTHER Fnaf theory on a completely separate theory channel that MatPat runs have we got a style theory, evolving the franchise yet😂😂😂😂
Scott should just buy out chuck e cheese and turn all 500 locations into fives nights at freddys restaurants/arcades and make better pizza
Does anyone gone to Bella Pizza it is a old business they have a resturant and a arcade really good
Funny how this theory could've been on food theory, game theory, AND film theory now that the movie is finally out
606th comment and 40 minutes ago since posted😂
and i was surprised the pizza showed up in walmart.
88 DOLLARS 💀💀
this is so awsome
am I the only one who didn't know they had animatronics before? I thought Chuck-E Cheese added them because of the movie
Do a Life series theory plz
So wii u
Ive literally been listening to rocka fire creepypastas and looking at videos of old animatronics all day.
603th commet 🎉🎉🎉
We should all email Chuck E. Cheese about this
I didn’t know Chuck E Chesse still had animatronics
i was really excited and hopeful that chuck e cheese would be turned into fnaf restaurants. it would be cool and kids would probably still like it too. i hope it happens one day
Heyo!! CEC, showbiz/rockafire and FNAF fan here, I haven't finished the video yet so one I have I'll edit this and say my final thoughts, I have been seeing so many articles saying that FNAF is the reason CEC is getting rid of because of the FNAF movie when that just isn't the truth I'm so glad that matpat actually took the time to do research and see that is wrong, it makes me so mad when I see people saying 'fnaf is the reason why CEC got rid of the animatronics. EDIT: OMG exactly CEC and FNAF need to do something together and honestly stop trying to appeal to kids, im still pretty young like very young, im 13 and i have been going to chuck e cheese my entire life, i got into FNAF when i was 4/5 and have loved it ever since and for awhile i was terrified of animatronics not because of fnaf but I still loved going, and if they would merge with FNAF they could absolutely save CEC, and they would attract more people if they would just listen us and do it, infact by listening to the fans thats how the Northridge location saved it's animatronics and cec fans are now trying to save a different location the one in Pineville, if we could save a few more locations we could probably do this if CEC doesn't shut down.
YESSS
Harharhahar
:]
Benihana in my opinion doesn’t have bad food and boring “eatertainment”
Why did he reference the glamrocks instead of the rockstars in referance to the newest chucky?
Yeaaaah STEVE!!
So what MatPat is basically saying is that Chuck E. Cheese needs to pull a FNAF 3 and become a real Fazbear Frights.
When i hear Fnaf killing chuckee cheese I just imagine Freddy eaten…
This one really could have been any channel but style.
Food?
Also as a sidenote, I've heard that the digital Mickey n Minnie ride actually breaks down and falls out of sync fairly often, and I just personally hate when they project digital faces onto an animatronic. The Elsa animatronic with the digital face scares me more than tarantulas, and I have severe arachniphobia so idk that might say something about how janky their half digital-half robot tech is right now
It was super obvious that Chuck E. Cheese took its opportunity to remove the animatronics. The first article i read was it blaming FNAF. Like no bro it’s obvious no one cares anymore and your using fnaf as a scapegoat.
Yes mat yes, this is the theory ware we’ve wanted to see, comfy and not cringey
PERMANENTLY RETIRED TO A SUBURBAN WHAT MALL
If I don’t get a Freddy Fazbear pizza place in 2025 I’m gonna go full fedy song on scot
Chuck e cheese was already dead. That's why fnaf was relevant.
YOOOOOOOOOOOOO
can you make a melanie martinez theory
I have been waiting for this theory for a little while. Thx MatPat!
That last joke made me think: despite it being a fan game, will Five Nights at Candy’s ever get a game theory episode?
I miss the old Chuck E Cheese
Hey Matpat I remembered something today that I feel like could have a theory in it somewhere. One episode from Rick and Morty had Rick become a pickle and he was able to control a cockroaches body by pressing the brain and later connected a rats brain to his own to make a sort of flesh mech. As disgusting and bizarre as that sounds it reminded me of the real zombie fungus that controls ants and other bugs to spread everywhere. I feel like there's a theory there, like maybe how long does the brain still control the body or something, but I can't put my finger on it. Perhaps you have some ideas?
15:44 who? :0
MatPat, I regret to inform you that the possibility of the animatronics being transformed into FNAF characters is but a mere dream. 💔 All the Chuck E Cheese employees have smashed them with a hammer, leaving them broken and unable to function. 😢
If they made a fnaf restaurant  id eat there's  everyday
freddy fazbear
Chuck E cheese, should be greatfull fnaf exists. As a person from Europe where isn´t anything like that, I would never know this exits. And I would never wanted to go there.
I was always afraid af chukie chesse
4:03 don’t point out the glam rocks, point out the rockstar animatronics, they are copying more than one thing matpat plz respond
I’m glad someone finally said it. I have young cousins who love fnaf, and I would totally love to take them to a chuck e. cheese if they created some sort of partnership with fnaf. Heck, I would personally go there to celebrate my birthday with my friends at my grown age! I feel like horror unites all ages, so this would be a great opportunity for everyone involved. I’ve been thinking about this a long time, but I’m glad Matpat put it out there!!
This is a comment
I went to a chuck E chees early this year and THE PIZZA WAS GOOD! im not kidding the food was the best part of my experience. And i to was expecting it to be awful or ok at leastm so PLEASE SOMEONE try there pizza again!!!
Interesting new video
It always comes back to fnaf doesn't it?, also if true that's probably the best thing to come out of fnaf, seriously these animatronics are creepy
now I havent watched the video yet but in my opinion fnaf has had the opposite affect of killing. I know chuck e went bankrupt but it was bound to happen anyway. its a 70s pizzeria chain
553 comment
Dude Chuck E. Cheese is just gonna rebrand to become Freddy fazbears pizza duh 🤓😎🤔
does  $50,000 in maintenance just mean one tech, going around the country all year ??
Wow is there nothing five nights at Freddy’s won’t enter?
2:07 That's how I'm going to imagine every boardroom from now on
For those wondering, Scott said he wouldnt make FNAF a real thing as a park, restaurant, or anything like that because he's scared someone would make the games real to become famous or something
3600th!
instead of fnaf, they should use the animatronics from willies wonderland
42589th
Hey Mat for your merch do you guys have plans to drop minimalist type of merch
when i was hounger i thought chuck e cheese and fnaf were the same thing
They announced this YEARS ago.
Well that's sad
Mattttt comoonnnnn you became network tv with all the commercials
Who went to work the night shift 12 to 6 .life insurance  not include
Wasn't his first theory video about Fnaf about events mirroring a real life incident at a Chuck E Cheese location. This came full circle huh?
Alot of the park fans are disappointed in the cheapening out on not having animatronics
Why HAVENT we gotten an IRL restaurant!?
Is the sweater itchy?
Matpat really thinks he can become a high quality clothing store and mark it up as youtube merch 💀
The fact that I need a suitcase in like less than a week and the northern lights suitcase is in pre-order makes me cry. Pre-order is the bane of my existence. Why can't I have it now so I can be cool and hip on my upcoming trip,,,
Josh Hukerson!
I, for one, am loving that Duolingo is leaning into the trend as well.
Mats' fist fnaf video is one that says it was based on an actual "death situation" that happened at a chuck e cheese now its full circle
“First”
Chuck E. Cheese is making a bad decision! More people would wanna go to Chuck E. Cheese because of the movie!!
S
rip chuck-e-cheese
so is Jasper gonna survive the fnaf-apocalipse? 1:41
What’s the similar franchise with the rat that he mentioned in the end of the video??
Scott should partner with Chuck E Cheese to make real Freddy Fazbear pizza.
Oh come on! All I wanted was to go in the US and see a IRL animatronics since they don’t exist in my country!
8:18 if this is true welp. Thomas DeLaur did a new update that says Alcohol is worse than junk food and cigarettes at this point officially.
blame fanf Flout they mass ours chuck e cheese anvager theme
Nah Chuck.E.Cheeses did that to themselves when started serving beer to parents
1:43 you forgot jasper!
Matpat never dissapoints
It makes me so sad seeing all the animatronics at theme parks replaced with screens. Like I GET IT but it still makes me sad.
fazbear fright?
I feel like this could relate to film theory aswell
but thats just a theory was missing!
Yoo
i was 11 and watched the fnaf movie.
Growing up, the copycat place we had was called Celebration Station, never even heard of Chuck E Cheese for years after this place shut down. Rainforrest Cafe was once at one of the entrances to a local mall, across from the food court. I never ate there, didn't even realize it was a restaurant. I had walked through/into it a couple times to see what it was, thought meh and went about my day. ok, the Five Nights of Fun,  a party for kids (up to age 10)... ok. Oct 27... ok. Only from 8PM to Midnight..? For kids under 10??
Have a awesome day
so what you're saying is make a chuck e cheese version of fazbear's fright?(from fnaf 3)
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
🐀💀🧸🔪
Hey i mean rockstar chuck E does come costume going up to kids. That sounds familiar.
Hey is main event a barcade
matpat is so entertaining
Just wait till Chuck E. Cheese rebrands as Fazbear Entertainment and opens a restaurant called Fredbear's Diner...
EEE
8:53 will there a other thing for the style theorists channel.
I feel like ever since they got bought out, the staff have gotten worse, bad attitude to kids and parents also damaged their brand significantly
FACT: Chuck E Cheeses middle name is Entertainment
Is anybody gonna realize this is uploaded on food theory instead of game theory?
It was me Barry
the title made me click because what does that MEAN?
Under 20 minute gang <3
22 min ago nice
So I can just buy a Chuck E animatronic?
yes
The fact matpat still remembers fnac(five nights at candy) and mentions it is amazing
If the next fnaf movie has a chuck e cheese reference in it, that would be awesome
But will they be replacing them with spring lock suits?
Personally, I hated the Chuck E Cheese animatronics and mascot as a kid WAY before FNAF was a thing. Freaked me right out. Something about not being able to read facial expressions or body language, I think (for the mascot, I knew that the body language was exaggerated and faked, and I was uncomfortable being in close proximity to that). I only ever went when a friend had a birthday party, and if the mascot came out, I was in the playplace up in the tubes, watching through a dirty plastic window until he went away again.
I worked at Chuck E Cheese as a manager for 2 years and it was a daily question, "Where is the Animatronics?" "is it true kids got stuffed in them?" "Do you know Fnaf?"
Like this if you love matpat
Arent there rockstar animatronics in fnaf6?
FNAC MENTIONED🎉🎉🎉
Matpat fans 👇
Sucks for chucks e cheese
rest in peace showbiz pizza 😔😔😔
Another great video covering food and how chucks e cheese relates to fnaf
The big issue is Chucky Cheese not taking advantage of the fnaf hype. It’s so dumb.
I believe what Chucky needs, it’s a matpat 😵‍💫
Dude, i love when uyou make chuck e chese content! :)
Glad you mentioned the experience vs material... I mentioned wanting to take my wife and 2 kids to Disney world.. tickets and hotel came to about 4k... I'd rather drop that much money on my children having those memories over anything material...
I can't wait for the Mickey Mouse horror movie since the first version goes into public domain in less than a month.
4:02 reminds me of the FnaF 6 animatronics for some reason.
I got the toilet cat ad
is *FNAF* chuckyz evil twin?
I was here so early wow
It's illegal to be this early
There even are IRL animatronics of the 4 main FNAF characters from the movie.
You’re the best
Dang i be early this time
If this is true the Internet killed a 90s and 2000s childhood nostalgia mascot.
NOT FNAF HERE TOO

As someone who recently discovered they have a huge passion for pinball I need a barcade asap
Just like FNAF AND CHUCK E CHESSE That's very offensive, but this is the ofenssive we like it

hi
Food theory idea: does food taste better when it’s free?
Somewhere out there, I like to think that Charles Cheese rebrands to FNAF. (A sort of reality that may or may not exist)
nah he lost it bru
as a guy who didn't even watch a second of it, I would say yes.
Can you pleeeeaaaase make a good burger theory
It will only be so long until fnaf has videos on all four theory channels
Thanks, Biben, and his inflation
Me and my friends going into Chuck-E-Cheese as the FnAF 4 tormentors and putting a little kid in an animatronic. And when we get kicked out, we’ll just say that we’re historical reenactors:
Getting rid of the animatronics feels so sad they were creepy yet iconic
Only real matpat fans can like this comment   👇
I LOVE YOU MATPAT. Serously i love how you go in dept into stuff. People in my school always makes fun a me because i watch you. Either way i love your content
This is a very interesting theory you made. To me, it makes a lot of sense!
In fnaf 6 they have Rockstar animatronics
chuck e. cheese killed itself... fast food temples are out. and chucky is, like, ancient.
Chuck E Cheese's was already on its last legs back in the mid-2000s. Frankly, I'm amazed it's even lasted this long.
Studio C Chuck is the only reason I go to Chuck E. Cheese's
Early 2000’s had SUPER CHUCK he had a mask and a cape. I worked at Chuck E. Cheese in like 2004 and it was so hard to see out of a mascot head wearing a mask 😭
Honestly, I want a food theory episode about how Luffy and Goku can eat so much food.
DETECTIVE MATPAT ON THE CASE!!!!
Weres is the full style theory freddyfazbear theory
shorts wars season 2 is back matpat go see it fast,,,,, just saying so you no matter where will see
Do we have to have FNAF now even on food theory? 😢 Chuck E. Cheese and Fnaf are both about animatronics that happened to stand in restaurants… They as topics have barely anything to do with food
Food theory never disapoints
Chuck E. Cheese should partner with Scott Cawthon and make Fazbear frights
man i love feddy frazbear
This video could qualify as a game theory, food theory or film theory
Chucke could cheese me anytime
14 min gang
After seeing the animatronics in the movie, Chuck E. Cheese CEO says let’s update the animatronics looks
I think that Chuck E Cheese should just become Freddy Fazbear's.
No more nights at Chucky's 😔
so basically, it's another case of capitalist executives who don't know what they want from their own brand and are scr€wing it over because of that?
one last time if youwant to have it light up you have to say the line... like yes really the whole line... say the line mat...
So sad that eaterntainment is failing. Themed restaurants were a big part of my childhood. In those restaurants I created fun memories with other kids and my family 😢
I like the silly“It’s Me” that was on the thumbnail at one point
Before I watched this, I used to think that Dave n Busters was a hardware store.
the animatronics at the chuck e. cheese I go to are just off, lights & everything, it's depressing with how they were when I went with my parents & not just for my cousins

agreed
Early!! ( I have no idea what to say )
the true man behind the slaughter
Yes and nice

Honestly if the real life FNAF franchise made a theme park or a restaurant attraction of some sort, it would probably be a major hit and I would go.   [EDIT] Just something fun to theorize about bc I'd love to go to a real-life mega pizzaplex as seen in security breach yknow but there are too many Aftons in the world \:
Matpat can you do a theory on Oranges and lemons are lying to us.
Chuck E Cheese is FNAF… I lay my case.
map pat what you said isn't true they have been removing stages since 2019. what they did announce is they would keep a stage right after the fnaf movie
This reminds me of their “five nights of fun.”
why is it always pizza and robots.
Isn't Scott hesitant to make a real Freddy's because he thinks someone will try to "re-create the story of the games"
Hi
Can you do a theory on restaurant special sauces? I’m not usually a fan of them, but from my experience, a lot of them look and/or taste the same, despite being “unique” special sauces. I wonder if there’s something behind that?  Edit: wow this comment got a lot of likes fast
I am genuinely surprised chuck e cheese is still in business. the health code violations, the bankruptcy, and an actual attempt to make a bootleg of the fnaf movie. how is it still open?
14:56 Wait until he learns a real life version of the restaurant is the LAST thing Scott wants……..  We don’t need a real Willam
Fnaf vs chuck-e-cheese. What side are you on?
FNAF Movie: *PG-13*  Toddlers: "I ain't reading all that..." *proceed to be scarred by the movie*
This reminds me of the time when I was watching your video about the Fnaf series being inspired by the murders at the Aurora Colorado location and my mom was in the room and she started crying because her sister's boyfriend got killed.
e
Fnaf in Style Theory when?
Time to start buying put options 😎
2:48 this background music always  gets me vibing
Fnaf is the face of animatronics mat pat
Removing animatronics from Chuck E Cheese is literally removing the reason they are open in the first place.
I'm more afraid of Chuck E Cheese rather than fnaf characters
finieite spagetti
Join my glorious clash royale clan. Rizzers 11 members. Every join i do 100 pushups.
Matpat i love your videos and style of information, and how much hard work you put into your videos, I've been a fan since 1Million subs of game theory, i love your vids <3
5:49 that sounds amazing
Style Theory is the only channel to have yet escaped the grasp of Freddy... but not for long
Recycled pizza is scarier than fnaf itself
I remember when Chuck E Cheese issued a DMCA on a creepypasta reader for a video taking place there. Good times.
Only one more channel to go, until FNaF has consumed all.
The animatronics at the locations near me have been gone for a while :/
id smash chuck
These channels will never escape fnaf
OH JA PIERDOLE; TO JEST FREDDY FAZBEAR OW OW OW OWOWOWO OW1
Why is this food theory?
matpat should rll be a detective lol
At this point none of the Theorist channels are safe from FNAF
Everybody: *discuss the  lore* Me:FREDDY FAZBEAR? UR UR
Even if this not film theory, you should talk about Hey duggee! lore. This is a famous BBC show in Briten and I would love it if you take it in considration. Thank you for this amazing content❤❤❤
plz make a food theory why such a large population of india is vegeterian
we should just stop making ai so that fanf doesnt become real life
I missed the intro they made
FNAF was Scotts way of getting revenge on Chuck E. Cheese for causing him childhood trauma woth their animatronics
Early gang ⬇️⬇️⬇️
before I finish watching this they have been rolling out their "improved" restaurants for about a year now this is not a new thing they've been getting rid of the animatronics before the FNaF movie even came out... the location near me had already rolled out this "improved modernized" version of the restaurant
Chuck E. Cheese really hit it low.
Congrats on 5 million subs food theory
I hope not. I'd like to have my children go there when I get old.... as long as there aren't any child murderers
Its pretty obvious since they reuse pizza still.
POOP9846 (pin pls)
One day my coment will also go viral😢
Never been to a barcade
Just love matpat being a detective.
Matthew, did the springlock suit crush Afton’s bal-
I mean honestly, those Chuckie E. Cheese animations were already pretty creepy, even when I was 8, I was scared of them; I thought they were old news in the 1st place.... And besides that, Scott got partly inspired by those animatronics anyways; Those guys just needed to be retired, They are an old and outdated idea of the future and very old technology, They needed to go...

Hi
3:16 anyone else know all of this from the tuv animontronic documentary
Lol
I work at Chuck E Cheese, we got to keep our Chuck cause we have a studio C location. People come in to take pictures with him :P

five minutes ago?!?!?!?
i really think chuck e cheese should double down on fanf’s reputation and go all in on the animatronics, and make the creepier, and change the target audience to fnaf fans, because that’d be epic and everyone can reenact fnaf scenes edit: i wrote this before watching the video. guess I predicted the theory. neat.
Just started [View view view!] , if this doesnt include the recent [Severe and continous laps in judment] I will be very [Unhappy Customers?]
After playing fnaf i definitely looked at Chuck E Cheese's differently...
why is this not on game or film theory
Only true game theory fans can like this comment
I remember going to Chuck E Cheese for every birthday party as a kid... and then it turned into a wasteland years later, and eventually, my own Chuck E Cheese was replaced by a much more lame place called Maudes Pizza or something I forgot... which has mediocre pizza and only 80s arcade games... that's it... bring my buddy Cheese back
As a kid I was more afraid of Chuck E. Cheese than fnaf 😂
Congrats on 5 million to the food theory team!
Fnaf didn't even leave food theory alone 😂
I'm actually shocked they never did a Halloween team up for a one night big ticket night
was confused why there’s only 200 comments, then i realized this was posted like 3 minutes ago
Here under 10 minutes | | |
Hey this is one where I watch 21 seconds of the vid and I'm like this is wrong Mat Pat they did this because the animatronics are too expensive they have been doing this for years now and the last one that had animatronics just got remodelled this year  so I'm sorry MatPat but you are wrong here. I admire your work though
Love matpat
hi
0:12 this is actually incorrect, Chuck E Cheese was already removing their animatronics for months before the FNaF movie was released for their 2.0 remodels. and most locations already lost their animatronics even before the fnaf movie released too
Matpat please you're having another mental breakdown
2 minute gang  👇🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
They removed their animatronics because if a kid went missing in one of their establishments it would rise way too much suspicion
Been curious if in a survival situation, can we survive out of pet foods?
SUB 1 HOUR CLUB!!!
They killed themselves by not collaborating with the easiest money making decision ever
Let's get this video 999
Still waiting for him to make a connection with Fnaf AR and the fazbear frights story, dance with me
Say ong
yes
gib me cheese MATPAT NOOOOOOOOO
2:49 this is the FNaF lore fr
Let's all sit and thank mat for all his work. It takes time to theorize the fnaf Fandom and we got this man to do it. Thank the lord! ❤🎉
Nice to see FNAF taking over his other channels FNAF is all matpat and FNAF will be All their Will be
One hour gang here👇

Ah yes, my favorite restaurant,  Charles Entertainment Cheese.
MATPAT WHY DID YOU SAY "HUNGRY" ON TWITTER

Love your videos mat! Would love to theorize with you some day!!!

Fnaf became the man behind the slaughter
Nothin better than a good fnaf vs Chucky Cheese   (They are litteraly the same thing idk what your on about)
こんにちは
No one will now why this comment will get 0 likes

I’m 0:01 into the video and I already know Matt pat is gonna do another drug endured FNAF theory for his FNAF addiction
I think it was a combo of Shane Dawson and FNAF
Hi love your vidsss ❤🎉❤🎉
I love your videos the food Theorists and chuck e chesse copied fnaf because of five nights of fun!
Matpat finally has a new version of Golden Freddy to use in thumbnails

i watched the video in 2 seconds and i can confirm that matpat is in this video
I want a chuck e chees animatronic so bad..... don't yall?
Early Theorist Gang!!
I don't know why im commenting, the video isn't even finished.
Tbh, Chuck e cheese would probably be way more popular if it wasn't only in the west. If it was also across Europe like Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, UK and more. It would be booming!
Food theory idea is Coloss-O's cereal brand from thundermans edible
We need to arrest matpat. He has put fnaf in his other channels to many times
You know its a good day when Matpat posts a video.
It’s like a collaboration between food theory and game theory
Mat Pat is so obsessed with FNAF it's gotten to all his channels not just game theory
Honestly, I’m not surprised at this point
Super sad :( :( :( :( :(
yay new ep i love these videos!!!
What’s up guy welcome back to chuck-e-cheese’s
Disgusting kids/inattentive parents killed Chuck E Cheese
Aur aur, aur aur, aur, aur aur aur aur aur
