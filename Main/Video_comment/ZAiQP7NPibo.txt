F!re
At last I feel offset vibes after a lot tough issues 🎉🎉❤ 🔥
In Paris and the name of this spot is « Les Tuileries »
This sound like something Earl On The Beat would make. Song is 🔥🔥
This dude cannot dress and looks like a homeless biker. 🤣 But Offset will definitely go broke dealing with a woman like Cardi B and having all these kids all over the place.
The flaw is fire 🔥 offset always the hardest
Very cool vibe
Shhhhh... 🤫 dats a dead man.... nah it's 5.0... "4,3,2,1"

I don’t think broke is losing in life  You can learn something from yeah  I like music but I don’t like evil sorry

Wow haven't heard of offset himself after a while, especially after what happened to migos, damn i havent been to an amusment park since 2019, got to go this year, could've gone last year, but he was showing the vibe what it was like not going in a long time, and finally goin in 2022. But the trap soul music at the end with rage samples was atmospheric and sounded nostalgic memories of his older stuff, and really enjoyed the new style here, after not hearing from him for a long time thinking he ended his career after disbanding migos, heard he was back this year, but hey its nice hearing from him after the ruff shit he went through, ik hes having a better year rn but nice hearing from him when i never heard his music still getting produced 🙏. Good job with the video edits, fun vibes, nice rhythmic trap/pop rap and nice rnb at the end with the rage music playing ▶️ 🙏 💙 ❤️ 👏 👍
Fresh to death like I jumped out a casket.🤵🏽‍♂️🕴🏽 How did this happen? rich nigga habits niggas ain't eating & they blame it on fasting.😂 Gang bars on this one.🔥🔥🕺🏽
Offset was smart to pick this beat. Way better and more unique than your usual trap drums. s/o baby keem
King
Hes gotta be sweating
Niggas be broke and ready to party...  Damn. Nigga called me broke in 12 languages.
Offset snapped on this remix! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkeHSbgw7BA&ab_channel=Starkovy
Offset music 🎶 go waaaaay harder than Quavo solo music!!! Facts!!

❤
5 4 3 2 1
that with a normal trap beat would be such a banger
Yeah dis a big tune
I’m not gonna sugarcoat it… I thought he was the best rapper, out of the three!!
does any one notice in @ 1:16 he sound like quavo maaaaan!! love the song
Such a good song😊
the beat is fenominal
this beat changes life
Toka dogo

🎉🎉🎉🎉
You need to do a concert with a hologram of Take off. 🤔😍🌹That will be 🔥
📍
I mf love this video lmfao
Bonjour
Nah this dude is everything🔥🔥❤️
Loveeeee Ofset
Man I can only imagine if offset and deltron teamed up shit would be trippy
RIP TAKEOFF
I love the visuals 😂❤ just a Sagittarius man having fun vibing
Bro I was cleaning up and dancing at the same time hell naw
I checked out his other new song it's kind of all right but I think offset needs to look at this song one more time and how he saying like that. Sounding like takoff and he'll see that he needs to go do that to make good hits
Baby keem produced this for anyone wondering
I hate them niggas with all my heart… offset…..this is fire 🔥
🔥🔥🔥 Offset Don't Let Us Without Music G Let's Roll Like Back In The Day
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
NICE MOVES OFFSET!
They mad, him and `Cardi is the new hot couple. jealousy and envy is dangerous. Divide families all the time
keem production W asf
This one of Offsets best songs. Can’t wait for the album
Didnt understand what he was screaming about 😢 Didnt get the point of the song....😢  WILL JUST HAVE TO GO BACK A LISTEN TO THAT TIME PERIOD WHERE RAP ( IF THAT WAS WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE ) MADE SENSE..  SIGNED : BIGGIE SMALLS FAN
1:49 that was a dope ass moon walk.for real my favorite dance move EVER.
Peng.
I really dislike this song, and dislike offset even more I use to be a fan, but I feel this song put a mark on Takeoff 🚀. Dude still ain’t pulled his gun, and take got touched, not long after this song. Quay a buster, and set is too no cap, y’all 2 guys belong together
"I collect shoes and dont even wear em"  Thats an L, not a flex...
54321 Takeoff r.I.p
1:14🔥🚀🚀🚀
Set goin harder then qua 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Damn, I just realize that offset was the main one on those fire ass hooks
Who still listening 🔊
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
LL TAKE

Yo i made a remix to this song and overlayed his vocals over my beat, yall go check it out https://youtu.be/pfOI0x04xso
Migooooo
This one big mess video you see he can’t rap 😂😂😂😂😂
Damn why is this my first time hearing this heat🔥🔥🔥😳
Offset really my favorite migo.  RIP TAKE
Sup Wit Some New Music Bro
I GOT #WAYNE IN MY BLOOD
I love when he said " 5 4 3 2 1 Takeoff...if you touch my brudah get a gun" Now this was before Takeoff death. I believe Offset and Takeoff were closer and had a real bond. Quavo was his Uncle but it doesn't mean he trusted him. Quavo move weird to me. If I didn't trust a NICCA was a picture... You'd see Quavo. He was the loudest in the room and wanted too much attention. He didn't know how to be a group member.

What's up with those big ass clown shoes ??? I don't get it . Are those in style now ???  🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
I ain't gonna lie, I never thought I'd see the Migos break up, let alone Takeoff pass away. I ain't into Offset's music but seeing him alone in this video actually makes me sad for him. May Takeoff RIP 💙🕊🙏🏻 I hope whatever issues Quavo and Offset had can be resolved and forgiven, they need to lean on each other for support.
Ok this that YRN shit here
5 4 3 2 1 TAKEOFF!!!! TOUCH MY BROTHER PULL THE GUN!!! POW!!

RIP take wish y’all would have done solos and still stayed a group 🥹
jump off the ropes like JEFF Hardy
Nigga in Paris for real !
Bru this is wack
This song done played at leaste 4 times
Offset is better solo. Just my opinion. Quay and take were a better duo without him too..again just my opinion
It's good to break away. Solo albums make YOU. The group will always be the group
My bro killed that moonwalk tho‼️🤣🤣

Franceeee 🥖🇫🇷🇫🇷
Offset was Da 1 anyway
Oh my🤭 u been robbed?
They gonna realize they messed up letting him go
5 4 3 2 1 TAKEOFF!!!
horrible song horrible concept....who told set this was a good idea? jeez
Get your money. F**k them sour a** ni**as. Can’t even keep his bitch. That’s why Quavo mad . That girl hurt that man. He probably wanted what you and Cardi got. But he picked wrong. 😂😂😂
I like this song his flow is the best!
Aye Offset ya boi Sora looking for his shoes bac.
Trash
Credo que musica foda
Nossa senhora mano acabou com o quavo e o takeoff junto kkkk
..
The one with Money was good but THIS ONE HIT HARDER🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥
It's OK he need to hang out with bone thugs so he can git a better flow study the rap legends git a better flow make more money put more content in your music really git a bigger bag
This is a “Bobby Brown” exit from New Edition flow! Ain’t mad at Offset! Sometimes you have to Set It Off and go out on your own!  This ish is pure fire 🔥 🔥 🔥
I think I heard this song about 980 times…. Don’t @ me
🔥🔥
❤❤❤
MAKE MORE MUSIC THAT SOUNDS AND FEELS LIKE THIS!!!!
Stay focus and stand for something or fall for anything
Bih can't tell me this ain't sliding
so damn sexy and who is that dancing with him looks like chilli son
1:47 despite the separation Offset still mentioned Takeoff in his lyrics setting of the chorus. 🤷🏽‍♂️
5 4 3 2 1 🔥
Offset has become one of those artist that when his music comes into my playlist I tell him to shut up before I skip
Is it just me or does all of offsets solo music sound exactly the same? It’s the same shit on a different beat. I swear every song he mentions a Cullinan or how he bought a new lambo when his wife actually bought it for him and that he’s racing Ferraris. Oh and can’t forget how he’s smoking gas it’s musty
Man everyone recycles that Jeff Hardy lyric whenever it comes to "jumping off" lol 🔥
that's so sick that he did it at a public park, good video production fs
🔥🔥🔥🤦🏾‍♂️
That Jeff hardy line tho 😍

This fool is better than quavo and takeoff
Dope track
Oooouuuu whooo!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
Must admit I like this beat 🔥🔥🔥
Ready for him Cardi to drop something ❤️❤️❤️❤️
From  2:16 moving forward,  if Dababy would have hopped on that part of the song, it could have been a lot doper 🔥🔥🔥🔥 but the song is still dope🔥🔥🔥🔥 big up to Offset and his team💯👌🏾

Hey man, if someone asks me to describe you with one word , I will answer with no doubt that you a alien.
54321
“54321 Takeoff, touch my brother, pull a gun” he lowkey sayin him and Takeoff still solid🙏🏽
He said I'll go out like PAC then to be a Kayne ..I feel it 54321
The best❤😍
Good shit 🔥
This beat is so ass i cant even listen to the rhymes
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hell  nah they sound better  as a group and the do big numbers together  everybody going separate  ways views not up like they suppose to be
Offset is better off alone
BRUH THIS BEAT IS LIKE NONE OTHER IVE HEARD OF BEFORE...LIKE GAH DAYUM!!!!
This song on repeat in my playlist. Offset ate this dope beat, insane flow!
better quality without control
MIGOS AINT THE SAME W OUT HIM
crazy that keem produced this
Rap music as its finest.
Song is GOATED !!!!!!!!!!!
LOOKS LIKE OFFSET IS THE REAL MASTERMIND! THEY SHIT AINT FUCKING WITH HIS!💪❤
Dope bruh I wish to get where u are
🔥
Offset the HARDEST RAPPER outta all tree o dem!!!! FACTS then TAKEOFF, Quavo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!👍🏾💪🏾💯👀
This sounds so much Iike a beat Travis Scott should be on.
Am I the only Person who feels Astro World vibes from this song?
I can’t help but play this 1 back to bck lol
Offset knew he had more to accomplish as an artist, that wouldn’t have been feasible as member of a trio, he expressed this to the other two and they took it the wrong way, simple as that. No deeper meaning behind their split. They’re all real ones they’ll be good 💯. That’s what I think happened.
Yeahh you got one w this Set 🔊
Boy sweeter den yams..............
Coldest in da game
P..stop playing and give OFFSET his money and rights to be a SOLO artist errybody in Da 'A' know Homie dnt fuc with you ain't speak to you in over 2yrs to the point that Unc & Phew have to do there own thing even changed there named for copyright infringement that would favor OFFSET its a mf shame that Rich Black Men can not do equal fair share and moral good business...VICTORY-OFFSET jus watch and see how this play out QC will lose MILLIONS can you say ...Save Us LIL BABY.....AGAIN!!!!!
I need the 1hour version 🔥🔥🔥
Waby Weem
#OFFSEASON 🧟‍♂️

🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Fire hard
The direction and production is genius
This song is too damn 🔥
They're better as a unit,but it's been a while sense they had a smash as the migos,I don't see that trend changing tho as they become individual artists.The migos should've had they're own label grooming they're own young upcoming artist.
The MOONWALK tho...
Song definitely in a dj log for a set
Video dope
Prod. By Baby Keem!
LITERALLY - Just-grew-on-me!
No jewelry! Dig that! Offset transforming into real hip hop artist. It’s about the lyrical content n message.

Keep going Offsetyrn… yessssss

i like how the video  is simple and just him having fun. Its not flashy as he could have done just that like  Takeoff/Quavo videos
Dababy wouldve been good in this, and i genuinely dont f*ck w/ him but he wouldve ate fr.
This the nigga they was giving bread while he was locked up

All the Offset fans like “Ima stick beside em” 💯❤️
Who else enjoyed typing the name of the song 🎶
🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yeeeesssssiiiiiiirrrrr 😎
Discovered this song on Facebook and most of em was dissing it. Talking about Offset should've stayed with the Migos. That's one of the main reasons why I'm deciding to leave that app for good. Nothing but haters. This song 🔥
So glad offset went solo. This song slaps
🤙🏾✨
Anyone else see his shoes

Migos have a a and b cycle  A cycle: group projects - features and Migos and videos with all 3 B cycle: everything else Solo projects, singles, individual verses, collabs, such as the quavo and takeoff collab.  After everything is said & done. They'll make another project
3 mil views just as good as what qua an take did. Offset always been the best spitter. Take got bars but always ben enderated. Quavo is the pop star undeniable artist hooks bars he has it all
https://youtu.be/2n2bxyNQ0u0
This is straight 🔥 bars through the whole song and the video A1 💯
Offset left to become a bigger star . He always had the best verses
Yes I'm the 🌊🌊🌊 Wave but don't got to show it uuuuuuuuuuu🔥
𝚙𝚛𝚘𝚖𝚘𝚜𝚖
Better than lil baby’s recent music 😂😂😂
Offset about to takeoff (54321) on the rap game. No Migos, just him. The world has officially been put on noticed! We all know Quavo is the most creative, Takeoff has the best bars, but Offset is the best songwriter and producer. He definitely has an ear for good beats. He can literally hear a hit record.
Bruh having fun….. ain’t nothing like owning your own music. Keep going Set!
Offset hit em with the moonwalk.

Offset said "niggas be broke but be ready to party".
Baby Keem and Mike Dean are genious for producing this one! As well as Offset for rapping over it so well.

🚮
Kill it takeoff‼️
Ya heard the Takeoff reference so maybe the beef only with QC & not Takeoff & Quavo too.
I remixed it haha🔥 Here's the video: https://youtu.be/fAc2AWJOiTs
He acting tough but he sweeter than yams😂😂
where was this shot?
Album.gon.be.fye.
I heard the beat and thought "wonder what kinda flow he gonna use on this?  *same flow*
www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQD1fY5T1VG
Set!!!!!!!!
I thought I heard Qavo in tht second verse,kno I was tripping.
It's interesting that I was "hating" on Migos. Their music after first Culture was just eh. But now both Offset and Quavo w/Takeoff are making good music, which is mainly entertaining and love it.
🔥🔥🔥
Paname représente bro :)
I wasn’t a Migos fan but I like this, offset dome pulled a Beyoncé and now he’s about to blow up
Ok this shit slap .. offset flow is magnificent
Keeeem and offset!!!!

I thought he was Quavo at one point. "Eww that's nasty." ♨️🔥
Not it, sorry… 🤷‍♂️🚽💩
I use to be a fan but after this masterpiece I am whole air conditioner
I was on the gram like naw… but heard the verses!!! That boy smoke this like a newport
🔥💯💯💰
shoes not it G.
I’ma vibe to this 54321 more times don’t mind me 🔥🔥🔥🔥🤧
🅿️
THIS HARD
Rocks on my neck like the Flintstone , I'm Bam Bam🚀🚀🚀🚀 😎😎😎
Fresh to death like I jumped out of da casket before the covid 19 we was maskin.. 🔥🔥🔥
baby keem and mike dean on the beat
BABY KEEM PRODUCED THIS FOR SET🔥🔥

This just proves the mush mouth shit was a gimmick
54321 take off
💪🏿🏆
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 can’t wait to hear both of the migos new projects.

Not finna lie this song not good
Lourd lourd fallait prévenir que tu passait j'ai vu les sto bien-sûr
💯👏🏽🔥👑
Ayeeeee🔥
i wonder what happened to the original video when he posted the snippet on his ig a few months back
This shit fyyyyyeeeee. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😖🤧
Not really a Migos fan. But can’t deny offset’s versatility out of the three. Quavo can make a regular song catchy. Takeoff is more technical. Offset can do both. A lot of his features are fire and keepers.
This nigga album finna be crazy 🔥🔥🔥
🔒🔁🕺🏻
Like him solo ❣️
He gne keep it up watch
Keep killing em set they ain’t fucking with the flow 🔥🔥🔥

I really enjoyed the beat. It’s not so trapped out and overwhelming. Definitely a great anthem.
Bro this is ass,not feeling it.Set way harder than this.
The migos really did part ?  Hope not
I love the beat. His flow sounds like a mixture of Cardi and the cast of wildnout  playing a rap game
Bro went independent even low production video but still producing numbers
Travis wouldn’t have been a bad feature for this 🔥
This is the best thing I've ever seen and heard 💥💥💥
Crazy how he switches flows, you gon’ think it’s three of him
Just let keem produce the whole album. This beat too hot

I think we found out where the melodies come from
Offset has been abandoned and left for dead but he will rise from the ashes in 54321!!!
1:15 Crazy. He sounded exactly like Quavo in that part
Go offset
This might be the smoothest/hardest track I've heard all summer. Offset with the W.
The first rapper to sign to his girl.
Dababy should’ve been on this
This a banger
So this is where that clip of him falling down the steps came from 😂
❤️❤️❤️
No more Migos? Damn
The moon walk tho
I need those crocs
damn dude you can count.  but can you count the millions you got screwed out of by the rest of the migos?  LOL!  edit:  full minute of no flows at the end because normally other migos would fill in there.  bro you're lost without them.
Loving the energy 🙌🏽

This Shyt Fye🫠🫠🫠
trash
I’m sorry but this song and video is kinda weak. Video is corny and the song is mid, especially compared to what the other 2 migos put out. It’s hard not to compare the two.
Very nice . I believe groups are better together but he does his thing as does Qua and Take when they do their own stuff too
music video sooooo hard
Lmao this is terrible
He sound like all 3 of them in 1 ..He is the Goat of the migos !!!!!! Yoll know thats facts

It seems like he can do all 3 alone.
Just shoot the video............location doesnt matter
I think they should all give up , I used to love em but this is just past it's time. I think people who like this are gullible and don't know any better.   Lil Baby is it now , period.   Quit while you ahead and make big biz moves
Imagine being at Disney land and seeing offset moonwalking on a table

Im cool w this but it wouldve been more cool if Takeoff wouldve came in after the count down. 5,4,3,2,1, - “TAKEOFF!” That wouldve been hard.
Not even a fan of the Migos at all, just not my taste of music.. but this shit hard I can't lie.

Put in years of work to get where he’s at, never stopped betting on himself. That’s ill ass fuck! As an underground artist, I love seeing success stories like Offset. He gives me constant encouragement and belief in myself and what I’m trying to make. So happy for you Offset, you deserve this so much. Thank you for your consistency and tenacity🔥❤️

Offset never miss🔥🔥🔥✊
to everyone reading this comment.Note success is the ability to go from one failure to another with no loss of enthusiasm so Don't stop grinding and hustling until you feel fulfilled, it's not all about been on top, the highest thing is just to feel fulfilled as you. Love yourselves and believe in yourselves because that's what will fuel your energy each time you feel like giving up. I don't have so many subscribers but the ones I have are so special to my struggle so far. I'm grateful they believe in me, they're the reason i will keep putting in my best ♥️♥️♥️
Love it ❤
