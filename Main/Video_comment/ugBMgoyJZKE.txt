hi! can someone please mark my writing:  A message before you sleep…  You close your eyes, but you might as well not have. Blindness is a natural occurrence when the sun descends, is it not? You shut them gently again, and I smile. Oh how fear thrives when you lose all ability to see- your future prey to the darkness, your shaky hand failing to grab a hold of it. Let me pierce the air, give the coolness of the night subtle undertones of danger. Your voice shrieks out into the emptiness of the night, and your successfully breaking a cacophony of silence. The tone, the echo, the sheer impulsivity of it- it sounds almost pretty. ‘What sort of madman am I?’ I hear the invested reader ask. ‘Why would someone want to torment children, leave them screaming in their beds?’ Their poor mothers and fathers, living on just a few hours of precious sleep. I think they should only have a few minutes. They should be endlessly terrorised by blood curdling screams, their hearts should pump blood as blacks as the nightmares of their children. But then they would die, and that wouldn't do any good. They’d be at peace, and I hate peace. Peace is not pretty.  I live in your future. I’m an artist planning your next steps like brush strokes on a milk white canvas. Today I want to have a bit of fun- perhaps a forest shall do the trick. In my minds eye I picture you wandering cautiously through densely packed trees as you pursue dancing patches of dappled sunlight. The forest shifts as you move: the sounds of winds sighing through the relentless trees. As you continue, something soft and sticky brushes against your neck. You wipe it off, and find your fingers are covered in misty white cobwebs. Confused you spin around, looking for its source. And just then, you feel the cold tingle of something small and many-legged creeping up your neck.You awake.  I almost laugh. I can really a spin a simple arachnophobia into the prettiest dreams, can’t I? Night terror, hallucination, bad dream- whatever you’d like to call me. I’m not going to go away. I can hear your young child’s heart thumping loud and clear, soothing my soul with its rhythm- what could possibly make me want to go? Life is a continuous battle; only the night provides a safe refuge for troubled souls like me. I have the courage to fight against my own morality, because I believe that this is what you deserve. Courage to fight the night lights and the dream catchers and those tired parents sitting at the edge of your bed to watch you fall asleep every night. I have the courage to fight it all. I specialise in inflicting children. Because children, in my opinion, have the greatest reaction to fear. And it will never really leave them. Even when they are grown, graduated, married… the rawness of their terror and the breaths they put into their screams will be etched into their sorry minds far into the future. They are imprisoned in a jail they have built for themselves (with my aid) and however normal they may look they are shackled and cut and bruised. And from each stinging cut, unravels the prettiest crimson ribbon you could find. All the while my eyes water with pleasure. I have to penetrate you deep- each careful incision into your mind takes practice and skill. This isn’t some simple arachnophobia we are dealing with. This is a nightmare. Your muffled talking, racing heart, perfectly timed adrenaline rush- all of this takes years to plan. You could at least show some gratitude, because I make you feel alive, do I not? I can make you feel pretty. And I know what I’m doing is wrong. I just like to watch your icy tight grip on the corner of the duvet, turning the skin around your fingernails porcelain white and leaving the blanket beneath crumpled and worn out.I can truly sense the tension in your hand transferring onto your powder pink cushion, holding on to it for dear life.But I’m also sorry I put you through this; you’re only a little girl. I can assure you, that beneath my glistening eyes and unwavering smile, a small part of me breaks for you. So when the night gets too dull, and the stars get too ugly, you can always count on me to make them pretty.  Goodnight, sweet dreams. From Nightmare.

Is there one for language paper 1. On a side note this is fire.
Love this
this one is a straight banger
Hi Mr Bruff, in Q4 of 2022 AQA English Language Paper 2, the question asked to compare their experiences of camping. I mentioned both similarities and differences, so it was kind of balanced. Will that make me lose few marks?  And in the same question, I noticed that the writer's perspective of holidays had changed in the last sentence, but  I couldn’t manage to fit that into my answer. So, my answer talked about the perspective which was mentioned in the earlier sentences of the content. Will I lose marks for not mentioning about the perspective that got changed in the last sentence?
Can we get some videos for Edexcel please?
