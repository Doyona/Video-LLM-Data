Dana always talking about breaking record chill bro your gonna break more record especially after ufc 300
Dana was boooozing here hahahah
How’s he a beast if he cried for Dana in a fight lol
And still.. $50.000
Isnt he fucking Awesome ??
This is literally Kevin Holland vigilante rescue caught on tape #4.  He is obviously staging these events.
Dana and rest of world realize that Conor saying rematch with Mayweather that super star is no more so let's call this guy s super hero . We needs another drawl
Dam Dana is getting old and fat pay your fighters
Dana is handing out bonuses for two reasons finishes sell and the UFC is making so much money he realizes fighters need a bigger share
Wonder were he got the scar on his head from? Badass scar.
If this was a ppv event, it would have been worth it
basically a snitch
Still waiting for grandad Dana to get a hearing-aid 😆
I like Holland he can be a super star but he had a lot of work on his game he has to do first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT9LLpxxy-0&t=3s&ab_channel=JRVojon
Danas arms 😳, my guy is def juicing up
The Schmo is the only one with good questions 👍
Amazing card. Awesome fights
Austin was an incredible night of fights 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Incredible fight card starting with prelims all the way thru main finale
https://youtu.be/0zMY2gFJqps
Give him the title shot!!!! My boy emmit
What about Buckley?  He looked like a world beater last night...
Never understood why he thinks we give a shit on how many people shown up.
Kevin looked awesome tonight. The whole card was great. The main event was a solid chess match, but I thought Kattar won. Aside from that, an awesome card.
When is the last time Eddie Whineland won a fight? Dude got KO'd by Omalley then (like a dumb ass) told everybody he had been welcomed to the sugar show. Should have forced to retire on the spot for kissing dumb ass Omalley's ass!!!
The UFC Is killin it
Dude needs his own show lol
Why don't they have personalized shorts honestly
13 thousand in that arena? Sounded and felt more like 60 thousand - that was one of the best crowds I've seen or heard in a very longtime...
y’all need to stop encouraging this shit or he’s going to get shot one time and it’s going to stop being cute or heroic
dana talking like he has mental health issues
It’s crazy how Dana doesn’t know guram and damir, but in 2 years they both be rank in top 5
Isn’t he fu$cking awesome
Wow Dana was in a great mood !!
Joanna in  bkb with in a year. Or bellator
Realife super heros need b.p.v and glocks. End up stabbed or shot at his rate.
Main event was a snorefest
Holland is so dope
Calvin got completely robbed I’m sorry. I usually don’t talk about robberies but it was clear Calvin was the winner and that one. He landed more strikes and stuffed all the takedowns never mind dodged so many power punches. I hope the UFC looks at him as the winner and gives him more opportunity in the future.
I'm convinced he's setting these things up now. Aint no way in hell you just happen to be in the right place at the right time over and over again
"The Ultimate Texas Fighting Championship" 😂😂😂
I am not sure how the fighter's metabolism works and why they have to cut weight before the fights? Actually I am curious why they can not maintain their weight? Anyone can explain that to me, as I am not a fighter, but I successfully maintain my weight for the last 20 years.
He got killed by vettori
Holland v Khamzat, v Brady, a lot of dudes. Its scary
I wouldn't be surprise if they match Kevin Holland with Nick Diaz or maybe Nate, stylistically it is a fight both Diaz brothers would take. I think he may be one W away from it. I really hope it happens, massive fight.
If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart the Father raised Him from the dead you will be saved. Romans 10:9
I started the Silva chant
LOWEST BONUS IN ALL SPORTS. -----
Dana was in a good mood so he gave everyone a bonus🤣😝. I see this guy like Scrooge McDuck swimming in all his money🤣🤣 & likes most of the fighters outside the top 10 in their division still have to work a day job to make ends meet.
Dana being generous wow
Dana is a multi millionaire and can’t get some hearing aids? I’m sure he could afford the top of the line ones? Or is he just completely deaf in one ear?
What really!? Kevin holland is washed up he fought nobody
Dana White is going to go down as the man you brought MMA to the world. Kinda like MJ and Basketball.
If Kevin Holland were to venture out to other opportunities after his UFC career I’d be open to it regardless of what he decides to pursue.
15000 or 50000 Dollars?
Although i like kattar but I feel Emmet with his power and speed will be problem for Alex or Max

I love Dana white but he also p*sees me off at the same time
Come back to OHIO uncle Dana
It is time for you to approach everything you do during the day consciously. You should constantly control your thoughts and feelings. Any negative thought in your consciousness must be nipped in the bud. Protect yourself from everything that contributes to the existence of negative thoughts and feelings in your consciousness.
Such bullshit fighters can’t rep brands on their shorts and make more $$. Look at golfers and nascar drivers. Same thing.
Daña is on roids you can tell easy his arms looks huge
Eww the chair with the UT logo
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!   "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus <3
I don't like to fight, forget
https://youtu.be/xeQCRKXiRpo
Dana must of made a shitload of money off of hollands fight to be praising him up that much
no one in the ufc is a super hero. also, super heroes do not exist.
Adrian yanez been preforming  Silva looked super dominant  Buckley looked super good Holland is just entertaining
Big John didnt get to question Joe first.... Colby said he Couldn't get up from the table
Who else noticed that the big dude didn't question Joe first
please please PLEASE stop going to texas man these judges are fucking LOSERSSSSSSSSSSS
Texas and Florida the two places all the liberals complain about, let’s you know Texas and Florida are doing something right.
Dana needs one of those ear trumpets you see in classical movies pretty soon
So if it was sold out does that mean there’s exactly 13689 seats? Such a odd number lol
Kevin is the closest thing to a real superhero as it gets. A professional fighter, talks while he fights (just like in the comics), chases down bad guys on the streets. All he needs is a suit n cape n it’s official lol
Dana when can we get a fight night in Gainesville great town the o dome has just been Renovated it will sell out easy
people just want bonuses to show up and no reason.. Imagine just showing up to work doing what you agreed to get payed for and automatically expecting a bonus...
Joe was definitely on DMT
I was at this event last night and holy shit it was an amazing experience. The atmosphere in the building was amazing every fight delivered with action
USADA should test Dana's urine. He's on something.
Its just insane that 50k finnish bonus isn’t the norm. They are litterally printing money.   50k for a finnish is the least they can do.
If anybody falls out get Kevin on that PPV card in Dallas.
Man they treated this fight night like a PPV and it deserved it!
Kevin looks super fast at welterweight.
The rock has his clown logo on the chairs lol?
damir vs guram was SO high level. it was ridiculous.
What an amazing card. Judges got the last fight right for a change as well.
Kevin Holland future champ !!!
He can have fights anywhere now in the states and canada so what he is talkin about covid restrictions are basically done with. We need a ppv here in toronto
Holy shit! The UFC was in my town and I missed it.
Dana giving out the bonuses lately. More success for the UFC mesns more money to the fughters. But the idiots win‘t get it..:
Dana's never going to understand British accents 😂
Stop chasing crack heads 😂
Holland has grown still he's fun to watch which is huge , even when he was getting beat up on the ground before he was at least funny and I think he's best at welterweight if it doesn't drain him too much.
Kattar was robbed
Now he loves him 🤣🤣
From not being wanted, to one of the shows main man to call for anything. I've been saying he is the truth LFG
Yanez killed it yesterday too
Big daddycab
So many knockouts!!
Good to see DW reward everybody again with finishes, his rationalization is corrected.  So many finishes, reward them all.
Holy crap John didn't ask the first question
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates—🟥
Can we give guram a normal person to fight.
What a great fight card this was, filled with continuous action all night...  Dana White doesn't get enough credit for the amazing job he does!   Let's not forget, he brought the UFC back from the dead and put MMA on the world sports map....
Steroid white
I ain’t gone lie UFC been giving niggas some good ass cards
They ask the same question over and over about how he feels about Texas events after the fight and don't ask the one question about D.C and Hawes getting into it a little bit.
Good to see ya Dana
The real Brown Hornet!
"I guess I'm just in a good mood and giving everyone bonuses" is exactly why fighters need to get paid more period, it shouldn't be dictated by the mood of their boss.
To anyone mentioning Fighter Pay: even fighters like Kevin Holland have expressed that pay is not an issue to anyone who fights frequently enough or markets themselves properly. 9 fighters got 50k bonuses, more than any in history. That’s 450k. Factor in purses, which are over 100k for at least 3 of the fighters on this card, and you’re running up costs close to the 1-1.2m mark. This event generated around 1.9m gross, so after everything is paid for, the profit margins for the company aren’t even that high. Do people want the company to go bankrupt or do they just not understand basic economics?          People mentioning Dana’s net worth being what it is(deservedly so, he built a platform for over 500 fighters on his roster to have careers that wouldn’t have existed 40 years ago) simply have no idea how businesses work. Then you have people mentioning how boxers make 30m+ per fight. That’s not realistic, it’s only the fighters like Tyson Fury, Anthony Joshua, Lomachenko, Usyk, Gervontaa Davis, etc. that clear the 1m mark. Go look up pro boxer payouts on undercards, then come back to me about UFC fighter pay.

I was there the building was definitely not sold out 😂😂 Dana lying
If Kevin lost….  Dana White: “yeah some guys should know when to call it quits…Kevin is a good dude but I am going to talk to him”
Dana is fucking massive?!
I want the HGH Dana White has
Fighter's are always talking about fighter pay, yet Dana's giving out 50G's like it's KitKats.  Moral of the story...STOP COMPLAINING AND PUT ON A GREAT FIGHT AND YOU'LL GET MORE MONEY.
Great fights all night. Feel bad for Kattar. He was way more technical, caused more damage and out landed but lost the decision. Emmet was just winging as hard as he could and was hitting arms and shoulders.....
Dana white preparing for light heavyweight debut
Kattar 3-2
Where was Joe Rogan? he lives in Texas ffs
we will get a microphone for me and a little ear piece for in your ear. I hate when you will say "what" "huh"? 3x in a row. xoxoxo
WTF he is straight up deaf. I know he has the same condition my mom has, which is memeniere's disease (he talks about it in a very old UFC embedded episode). I'm wondering if he had the surgery since it can cause heating loss.
50 Gs is like 5 dollars to Dana white .  Punching there brains out and that’s all they get . But great fights lol
hey xoxo
This year of UFC has so far been perhaps the least entertaining ufc has ever had and last year was maybe the most entertaining
Dana needs to stop cursing. This is a family sport  Society's morals have really deteriorated
9 bonuses thats whats up got to break off the talent! What a great card everyone came to bang!
@fourpodcast KEVIN WAS A PROBLEM AT 205 , 185, 170
Should be 100K
1:26  Dana white: yeah... goodnight! *leaves the room*
stupid questions like always
Hands down biggest arms in the business!!!!! I woke up watching this and went straight to curls
This is 2 event in a row that every finish gets 50k you can't argue fighter pay anymore when it's purely performance based
Lol I feel Dana not being able to hear well sucks ass
After the Namajunas/Esparza fight everyone should have got a CAR!🚗
Kev has one of the coolest stories. Had a good performance on DWCS, but Dana didn’t like that he talked so much, now look at them. Lol
How about Adrian Yanez? I'd love to see him and O'Malley go at it. I think that fight would be fireworks.
Yanez really next champ
This night was too much for my brain
Stop chasing crackheads🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
MMA is Holland's side hustle
Holland  for commentary
Kevin vs kamzat 🔥
Maaan white use to be so annoyed with Holland, im loving the turn around the kid is producing, im rooting for him to climb up the ranks
I'm so happy Jon didn't get the first question
they could chuck in a 10k to 20k finish bonus to give incentive
Kevin Holland isnt going to be a problem for any top fighter in the WW Division lmao. Usman, Chimaev, Burns, Colby, Edwards, Belal, Shavkat all going to beat his ass easily.
San Antonio Texas
no need for cowboy to fight at 155 let him fight at 170......
UFC: so kevin how many times do you wanna fight this year? Kevin: yes
NO
Lol what. Kevin didnt do that well.
Dana’s gambling trip must’ve done well the way he’s handing out bonuses tonight
50,000 is like 5 bucks these days
Pay the fighters
Agreed,  *IF* he does stay disciplined! Ive been a trailblazer fan since day one! My one thing I’ll say it seemed like he can tend to get wreck less with his combinations. He can’t do that against the 15 up top they will make you pay for that! They won’t miss like tim we will see how he matches up with the top! That being said Kevin looks *EXTREMELY SHARP/FAST/ACCURATE* Takedown defense is 10 fold better than I’ve ever seen it!
50gs ain't what it used to be.
Please come to Minneapolis again
Kevin said he’d fight 3 more times this year *
Main event was overrated
Beautiful humans representing the best sport on earth. The respect for them all is fantastic even after battering the shit out of each other in the octagon? Dana represents the UFC like a champ himself ? Love the UFC and all it does for humans 🙏🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿😎
It’s cool that Dana put his sons birthday first
they don't need anymore Texas shows...it's going to be Nascar Fighting League soon
Dana hated Kevin before...this shows you you can judge a book by your cover. That guy you think is a douche could be your best friend.
Everyone loves Kevin Holland... and if he continues this way throughout his career then he will get HOF status regardless of whether he ever does something extraordinary in the cage.
“50 grand for you! And 50 grand for you!” - Oprah White
Everybody 50k bonuses?! Wow
Every UFC Fighter to Dana White: Kid
Kevin Holland is like a chris rock and Bruce leeroy hybrid with a splash of dc young fly
Hi kevinnnnnnnn - SpongeBob voice lol no homo.  Check out my picks review video. I went 9-4. And caught Joe on his phone during the Wells ko of Mcghee, in my shorts.
Kevin Holland is a problem at Welterweight until he hits the wrestlers.
Kevin is a perfect role model for black kids 🇺🇲✝️🌈
Danas starting to look more like kingpin everyday✝️🌈🇺🇲🙏🌍💚
Ah Daner real quick…
Fml
Dana needs a translator to help him with any reporter who doesn’t have American accented English 😂
didnt know ufc was on even? stop puting a weak ass card
His answer about the personalized shorts was ridiculous.. of course he’s thought about fighters and the ads on their shorts he’s the reason they aren’t allowed to personalize their shorts.
Kevin fought an unranked, all too Happy to be a steppingstone out of shape Chicken hawk
Why is cerrone even cutting weight? This isnt a contendership fight or for a ranking right. He looks like death making 155 let the guy fight without a weight cut 170 for fuck sake
Emmit vs the winner of Ortega vs yair
Holland has a chance to become a big money maker. Its up to him to be focused. I hope he is, he's a fun fighter to watch.
Kevin holland is the man. Hella funny memes, building a fan base on social media, and proving you don’t need to just play the heel.
Damn he gave heaps of people $50k! Generous Dana in the house
50k is a pathetic bonus for the greatest fighters in the world! It should be 100k !! Inflation !
Forget the Kattar fight, that was close. Guram got absolutely robbed.
Kevin needs to stop throwing punches and bringing his head along with it. He is going to get caught, yeah he's awesome but doesn't anyone else notice that ?? We have exercises in my gym that help people stop habits like that, I'm assuming most of these fighters must have access to someone who knows these drills and such. Holland is awesome but yah... Don't want his hype train to get completely destroyed before he gets to headline a card.
Holland vs masvidal is the fight to make
The way this man cares for the business and puts it first pure capitalism
Nobody going to talk about how big Dana's damn arms are?
What's with Dana calling very grown men KIDS? I dont get it. Is it an ego thing? Like him saying "I'm older than you do I call everyone a child." It baffles me! Great card. Fought by hard working men. Pretty damn easy to say.
Shame I have to watch ufc muted cause the USA fans all think they are Rick flair
Dana has been having sound issues since the beginning of the UFC. Wtf is wrong with the sound guys?! How does Dana not have a monitor right beside his God damn head blasting in his fucking ear at every single presser? Like why is this an ongoing issue?  Somebody get this man a monitor!
Great card shoutout dana loved the card , holland was my fave fight he was good at middleweight but welterweight he was GREAT
one of the best sports to see noticeable improvements in athletes in relatively short periods of time.  with your head on the platter each time out. amazing.
Rogan doesn’t do international cards and he also doesn’t do cards that are in his city either I guess
"CAN YOU STOP CHASING CRACKHEADS?"
Why doesnt Dana have an ear piece in EVERRRRRRR! LOL
Daddy Dana worth a billion but won’t spend a dime on a hearing aid.
Main event was kinda meh… cattar won
I’m so proud of him man he’s like watching one of your kids grow up and doing well
Dana’s Comments about cowboy not wanting to cut weight again really confuse me, why not just fight another older 155lbs fighter at 170? Don’t know why all these older guys who are nowhere near the title picture aren’t fighting up a weight class anyway
Cowboy should fight Nick Diaz at Welterweight.
The Ultimate Texas Championship 😅🤣😂
And nobody asked about him and his son's birthday even though he brought it up
Oh no!! I really wanted the cerrone and Lauzon fight.
Omg we gave everyone $50k.... Aka we gave everyone 2 minutes of our  income we receive every day, we are so charitable.
Why doesn't he get a hearing aid?
Dana looks so big 🤣
Kevin vs khamzat would be epic
The 50g's for a finish is a great thing, fighters get money and we get fun fights. Hopefully no more boring point fighting.
One of the best fight nights ever!
I appreciate Dana being bonus happy with finishers.   That bit of gravy on the win purse should, could elevate every future fight.  Keep it up Dana.
Dana came a long way from trying to kill holland by putting him against santos for his debut to now saying “I love the kid”.
Where the fat guy who asks the first question 🙋‍♂️ all the time 😂.
He’s good at welterweight, but overrated.  He’ll be gatekeeper level.  Which is no knock
Asif not one reporter asked about the Buckley performance looked unreal.
Canada is open now...
I love Holland man
he got the wrong holland he thinks kevin is tom holland
I thought he said " I love memes" Instead of "means" lol 2:05
Guram and Damir deserved FOTN more than Kattar vs Emmett. Also Natalia Silva deserved a bonus.. Atleast all the finishes got a bonus
Kattar 2,4,5 a stain on a fantastic card.
Nothing against Kevin seems like a decent dude but he just has a big mouth. The thing that I see in him is that he is attracted to drama and trouble I don't think he's realizing that  always involving yourself in third-party encounter it's one of the most dangerous things you should not do. He is constantly involved in third party encounters. Now I think that him beng a wannabee batman is normal to mma guys but he needs to stay out peoples biz. I can see this already going to end badly.
Kevin's best bet is to try and not be overly active. There's reason most champs have solid breaks between fights. Dana loves active fighters until they're burned out and not making money for him
I have mad respect for Kevin holland I just hope he don’t get killed trying save the day to many times I would be really heartbroken I been a fan of his a long time
Everybody gets 50 k , we love you uncle Dana
Stop trying to make this clown out better than he is...he will never be another Jon Jones Dana because everyone sees shat you're doing.
Guran vs dimir? Why would you ask about this fight? Who gives a fuck
Richest man in the room.. still no hearing aids.
UFC has no reveal in the fight business. Watched PFL MMA, was like an amateur show compared to UFC
This was one of the best cards in ufc history, exciting from start to finish, main event was a dog fight, Josh emmit is a bad motherfucker
I love how Dana acts like he's being charitable when he gives fights 50K. A sum that hasn't increased at all in so many years and knowing he underpays basically everyone
I think it's because aljo and others came out about fighter pay ..so their starting to give bonuses like cupcakes now
Dana's "big mouth" became Dana's superhero.
When is judging in MMA ever going to be fixed. Those are the questions that should be asked
Texas in a nutshell: great fans, great event and atmosphere, shitty judges ruin the whole thing.
Batman stopped MORE crime ???!!!  🤯🤯🤯
Those personalized shorts scared Dana 😂. Man doesn’t want them to have there own sponsors on the shorts no matter what 😂.
people who rate Kevin catching homeless people stealing water 🤣😅🤣😅🤣 bruh. he might aswell be mr Anderson in the matrix keep the slaves in line
WHY DID TANNER BOSER  PULL OUT OF THE FIGHT LAST MONTH? WHEN ARE WE GOING TO SEE HIM FIGHT AGAIN?
Kevin Holland is long & lanky so even though his movement isn't that good he out strikes shorter guys. He's got KO power and half decent wrestling defense. Being tall means he has a higher base which makes it easier for a shorter guy to take him down. He said he only weighed 190lbs at MW so he's lighter than Burns who said he's walking around at 195lbs (and was a former LW). He's not heavier than most WW's, but he's got a higher base & half decent wrestling defense while being a gifted but not very technical striker. He gets beat by most of the top 10 I think (Sean, Wonderboy, Belal, Gilbert,  Khamzat, Leon & Colby) & of course by Kamaru too. His range might help him against Vicente & he might KO Masvidal & Chiesa & Neil are also 50/50 fights I think. He's looking good at WW so far but he's only fighting OGs (old guys). It's a good career choice to build his name back up but doesn't mean he'll last at the top. I doubt he fights in a real #1 contender fight though he might get a title shot if he KOs someone in the top 5.
Dana says, "I wish him well in his retirement", as if he's getting a pension with healthcare etc lol. Eddie will be working in the supermarket for min wage like many others
Everybody getting 50k tonight? On top of there 12k base pay? LMMFAO
Buckley is entertaining as fck, look forward to his next fight.
i actually dont understand why people still say shit about fighter payment when Dana literally gives away 50 K everytime someone earns it
VS made that fight harder than it had to be because she is stubborn and wanted to beat TS at her strongest point.  Bring it to the middle and keep it standing, we arent even having a discussion about it.
did he say it was a “absolute war “
hope theyre not still giving the bonuses in bitcoin
You are so generous Dana , giving fighters less money for a bonus than one of you blackjack hands … you are what’s wrong with this world
Why would u have to ask if Joanna is gonna be ab HOFer?
How are people not praising Dana for doing all this 50k bonuses. I think the UFC stepped it up and are taking care of the fighter much better nowadays!!! Just what all of them deserve!!!
new mike pence jam! https://youtu.be/LP851JmQN8Y
https://youtu.be/LP851JmQN8Y
Kevin's wrestling and takedown defense has grown so much!!!! That unique striking style is so unpredictable. He's grown so much as a fighter and it's freakin awesome. God bless.
Dana’s head looks like it’s had a C section
Kevin Holland VS Khamzat Chimaev is the fight to make.
I think that is the most efficient way to finish a fight. Knock the opponent down and finish with a submission.
Don't understand why people are acting like Silva is already a champ. She wasn't fighting a top 5 opponent. We have no idea how well she will do against a top opponent.
We all knew this was gonna be an awesome fight card!!
Dana has the chicken look going on, age comes for everyone I guess
Ufc 4 the game in career mode always has holland winning the belt in welterweight 😂 can’t wait to see it happen in the future.
Fuckkkkkkk….it’s always the ones I miss (had to work) that are the absolute banger’s…and my dumbass can’t not google it when I get home
🇰🇿🇰🇿🇰🇿🇰🇿
Dana- I can’t hear well.  Random - why don’t you just get it checked it out?  Dana - we’ll see how this thing plays out.  Random - *nothing* Dana - Thats a good question. We will see on Tuesday.
I love dana white
Kattar won that shit
Dana is an idiot sometimes…if he made the finishing bonus a permanent thing he wouldn’t have to pay it out unless somebody got finished and it would make more exciting fights by making more finishes. Jesus even I know this you cheap ass that’s how afraid this guy is to hand out money to his fighters.
Dana's still bragging about $50k bonuses.. Bro with inflation that's only like $30k 🤦‍♂️
DanaTalking about thank God for technology because he got to be with his son and watch fights. No you weren’t with your son you were on the phone with your son. That’s how disconnected we are anymore. I feel bad for your kids I was just thinking about this the other day you guys have no clue what you’re missing out on by spending all day stuck in your phone. It’s like population control by turning all your nerdy children into virgins
1.93 million for a fight night 🤔 Really?? 😄
Ultimate Texas Fighting Championship 💪 😤 👏  Do it Dana, it has a sexy ring to it
"We will continue to bring the ufc to places that make it easy to run the business"  "Australia has left the building"
Silva best fight 🫡
*THIS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN A BETTER CARD FOR JOE ROGAN TO BE IN THE STANDS WITH FANS*
Dana giving everyone a bonus equals 🐐
These are the types of cards we want 👏
50k a piece !!!!! Nice 👍
🔥🔥
I loved it
For the love of god,can we get Dana an earpiece?
Can’t wait till UFC comes to UTAH!! 💪🏻👍🏻🍻
Enjoy Dana's post fight interviews as much as the cards... Guys a G 💯👏👌✌🖕
Then pay him superhero money.
superheros get knock outs
Cant tell what looks whiter danas skin or his shirt😂😂
I’ll personally assault anybody that talks crap about Dana. He’s the greatest promoter of all time and truly cares about his company and more importantly his fighters.
Holland looked great tonight
30-27 was WERIDDDD on the usma fight (soz on names), glad majority didn't go to decision
Sold out?!? I saw some empty seats. Insane card tho.  That Guram/Demir fight was technique personified I hope they both get 50k and the 25y.o ,tiny Brazilian chic she was superfast and tagged Jas up I hope she gets 50k as well
21 years ago you could watch the fight without your son thanks to technology got to love dana just proves no amount of money can give you braincells
Kevin Holland is one of my top 5 favorite fighters. Dude always entertains the fans

Dana finally lookin white
Kevin Holland vs Jorge Masvidal . It must happen.
Yanez  smoked Tony Kelley
Kattar won 4-1
Katter won sal da mato bs like normal
Dana looks like bam bam biggalow
Shame the crowd was so trash, booing all the time.
STOP CALLING GROWN MEN KIDS
UFC is getting better and better.
Gees talking more about last week's fights than this week
What about some of the fighters who took the brutal beatings tonight? As much as I like Dana White and the UFC. It's like Financial rape.
NO ONE BROUGHT UP STUPID DC ARGUING WITH A FIGHTER HE WAS GOING TO INTERVIEW.
10:06 Dana has good ass taste in food, that chicken here in dfw is to die for😮‍💨🥴
Entire prelim card was so mismatched it was basically fixed
Holland lookin' good 👍 Man can scrap !
Screw California and NY keep the UFC in Texas and Florida!
Dana's Biceps are Bigger then my Big Fat Dummy 😬
USADA needs to check Dana dudes arms looking a little thick
I say holland moves up to middleweight again like dana said his wrestling getting better
Dana said exactly what i commented yesterday on a Instagram post, it's like khabib vs Tony. 😲 Wow
Who else would be keeping an eye on superheroes other than Mr Wilson Fisk over here 🤣🤣💉💉🧪
Dana you getting old !
kattar got robbed
Dana get a damn hearing aid..you may think it makes you look a certain way but sitting there with your hand cuffed looks stupid
ROBBIE LAWLER VS DONALD CERRONE BOOK IT!
What’s Dana’s deal with calling grown ass men “kids” like wtf?
It's funny how he struggled to say "everyone gets 50 grand". But regardless that's NOOICE
disappointed with main event
Kevin went from that annoying big mouth to my favorite fighter. Cannot wait to see him verse Khamzat or Kamaru
It was a favorable matchup for Holland so I don't get the hype ...i get they're trying to push him but lets see how he fairs against the top competition
These fights were top notch!
BREAKING!! Dana White dies in a motorcycle accident.   You heard it here first.
Good Emmett got it, knew he'd get the win, I don't know what people were talking about saying 2-1 to Kattar going into the 4th 😂 Like wtf, Josh won 1/2/3 if you watch prolerly & know how to judge it.
UFC is way too much like WWE now. Vince McMahon bought mad stocks
Every time holland fight it has that crazy feeling to it. Definitely a top 5 guy to watch, he’s going to be a threat to the division real soon.
Yeah Dana, he’s a true “super hero” 🙄… bet: in 5 years Kevin will be complaining about pay just like the rest
kattar got robbed
I really chose the perfect card to miss..smh. I did catch the last 3 fights, but god damn.
He is still doing this s***
Dana must give "the kid" Natalia Silva 50k for that impressive perfomance in her debut even without a finish.
Was John Morgan at home?
From dana calling him "the big mouth kid" to a "superhero" is crazy, way to show the boss kev🤣
We should start a GoFundMe page for a new pair of hearing aides for Dana White......
Dana Holland
How did Emmet and Kattar get FOTN? Like don’t get me wrong it was pretty decent but compared to the rest of the card it was pretty lackluster. Marquez and Rodrigues should’ve got it imo
Good job dana
Sucks that a fighters financial stability and overall quality of life is dependent upon Dana’s mood.
Dana white..
Want to see Yanez vs O mally and also see Holland vs Izzy.
Uftexaschampionship haha
The future fight to look forward to is Holland vs Chimaev 😳💥👊
I get she didn't finish but the girl at 125 put on a damn show!!! She should have got the money
Dana about Holland : "isn't he fking awesome?"
I hope Holland can keep winning often enough to hang around as a big name gatekeeper at the least! He could still potentially earn millions and millions with his awesome personality
Dom is annoying as an announcer.  Always throwing shade at DC.  get over it fool.
come back to nashville !!!
No remarks on Joaquin Buckley's performance? He was AMAZING!
I say you book Cerrone vs Nick Diaz
Dana you  going to do JRE this week since you are  in Austin
You can't just beat down Kevin Holland. He'll come back like nothing happened. Only certified killers can take on Kevin Holland when he's serious.
Adrian Yanez had an amazing performance, I’d like to see him fight a tough wrestler or just build his record a little more.
Uncle fester rocking the v neck lol
Starting to think Dana might actually be going deaf, and not just pretending to avoid questions.
nate diaz vs kevin holland would be sweet
Is Dana selling Mr clean 😂
Kevin should be the next Spiderman lol
So glad to see that Joanna is going to be in the Hall of Fame! So well deserved, no other champion in the SW division has done what she has done! 👍🏼💯
I love that Dana has more money than God but can't buy a hearing aid.
Lol… that’s laughable. When Dana likes a guy he does everything to help that guy out. Holland the so called new hot prospect that was supposed to challenge for the title is now fighting 38 year olds…
Dana giving the person what they deserve
I live in Austin and I knew I should’ve gone to see this card it was full of good fights ! 🔥
“Do You Have To Tell Kevin To Stop Chasing Crackheads”😮💀🤣
Everybody crying Dana pay the fighters. Now he hands out 50k for everyone who comes thru with a finish. Let's see if people shut up
We need a event in San Antonio
Dana White is the only person in the world when he smiles you can't see his top teeth.
Dana looks like he does steroids without working out
Kevin looks like Chris Rock’s big brother (the one Will Smith wouldn’t slap).
I think the ufc fighters got the message to never leave it in the hands of the judges.Now look how how every fighter is after the finish & get 50k
Dana looks old and stressed
Dana looks like a Thumb.
Dana got 👂’s for days but cant hear shit 😂😂
Dana watchin the highlight reels before writin bonus checks: "im never gonna financially recover from this"
Kevin looked great tonight. The fans win when kevin wins, what an entertaining dude
Kattar won in my opinion
Jammer loves ys
Love ya Dana
Power
Jacksonville
Kevin Holland vs Colby Covington...........
What an incredible card tonight!!!  Bravo!!
I do think Volk will win but I think Emmets the worst matchup for Volk in terms of their styles being pretty similar, two small and stocky hard hitters going at it, would be a banger of a fight
Kevin killing it in the comments my boy stock keeps rising stay safe bro keep it up
i usually agree with dana, but its sad that the ufc is trying their hardest to push holland when he clearly is not top 10 calibre.
Funny how Dana hated Kevin Holland and didn't want him in the ufc now he's one of his favorite lol
Kiri v Jan in Ireland
Why is high head growing
Sold out my bollocks
dana is jacked!!!
Dana seems a little coked out in this one
It was only a matter of time before someone asked about Joe Rogan being in the crowd as a fan lol 😂
Dana White’s favorite fighter of the year should be a ufc awards category
Dana getting heavy again!!! Fuck it Friday turned into “fuck it daily!”
“Can you stop chasing crackheads” lmao
Adrian looks like a young Jorge masvidal!!
Tonight's card was crazy. It was like a ppv card with no additional cost
MMA and UFC is lame and even more lame is all the followers and people here commenting 🤦🏽‍♂️
lol at Dana looking like Mark Coleman or somebody
That door is getting fired.
A good excuse not to give more money to your employees "fighters" You know i can't hear very well aka play deaf.He is a genius of superstrategy.
Where’s Dana’s top teeth ?
Best fight card I’ve seen in a long time. So many future contenders
From start to finish, we got spoiled with awesome fights
Emmett cash that 🙏
Kevin so fast its all jokes until u tappin out
The card was decent. Wish there were more finishes 🤷🏻‍♂️
Thought ufc was gonna be greedy and not pay them all lol
Guram got robbed
Yanez to the moon
roku has the movie with Gina and cowboy
Damn. Dana looks jacked.
Kevin Holland makes headlines for all the right reasons
So happy Kev didn’t fucking great 👍🏼 in his hometown
if you show up you get paid. with social media you should be creating ad dollars. just put on a show. there’s a stock app for fighters. put on a show.
What happened with the cowboy fight again
Amazing job white keep up the good work 👌👌👌👏👏👏
I so should’ve went tonight damn…
Yk what’s bogus emmet is the clear number one contender now but if max wins he’ll have to wait bc there gonna run a 4th fight if max wins but if volk wins there’s been talk volk might try to pull a mcGregor and get 2 titles 😭 so he’s gonna have to wait either way 🤦🏽‍♂️
What…a…card…
Come to Miami already 😭 nobody ever mentions it to Dana
Why wasn't dana and Joe rogan not in Singapore for jiri vs glover fight  It was a banger
addicts... Not crackheads
Dianabol White cares about his own wealth. Stop watching this crap! Start prepping people.
He's almost 30 idk about calling him a kid
2:22 dana white talks about Kevin Holland
I love everything about UFC except the women fighting
"Kevin Holland was always my friend"
looking back at everything, something just doesnt sit right with me about cerrone getting "sick" right before the fight. I didnt think much of it but then cerrone started explaining himself for like an HOUR about what he ate. The whole thing just reeked of dog ate my homework
18 years of $50k bonuses. Adjust for inflation and the bonus should be $127k now. Stop screwing the fighters Dana!
Dana's ears gets the worst satellite signal.
The MacLife guys keeps asking the same fucking questions .In act,every fucling one of these journalists!!!
Kevin should learn from the rest of the guys on the card, try and finish your fight, the three ZOMBIES will damage you if you leave it to them.
card was a sleeper BANGER
You all acting like Kevin Holland didnt fight a complete can tonight
Everything went well about this fight night until we came to the Judges in the Main Event...oh Judges what IDIOTS!!
My God, the press is so stupid
jone jones would whoop any one
Use me as a “Kattar Won” button
Dana taken so many fighters souls he starting to look like Thanos
I thought it came down to the last round and Kattar won that round. But not a robbery. All the fights were good
McGregor vs aldo 2 should be a thing. And kabib vs  Jorge sp
Guram vs Damyr - "what fight was it?" That's exactly the reason why judges robbed Guram... Where you all were f.....ng looking to? Stop watching other sports with judges...
Dana paying his fighters? Rarity for sure.
Thanks for the video, THEMACLIFE
Ufc killing it with the banger cards. Such a good time to be a fan
Holy schnykies, I thought I was gonna be first not 139th, not on toppa the world Ma
Tim means just let him have that win. Dana gave Tim an extra 100k to let The star of Kevin keep on rising.
Pay your fighters
Kevin Holland is so sick 😂😂😂 HOW DOES HE KEEP FIGHTING CRIME
Sold out, but you can always see empty seats.
Dana get a hearing aid. Don’t be deaf all the time.
Kevin “ADHD” Holland!!! 😂
MainEvent was crap
Texas cards never disappoints
Do they break a record every event they have or does Dana just be saying that😂😂😂😂
so generous 50 k lol make them higher these beasts deserve it
holland is back 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼🇩🇪
Get Kevin Holland on Rogan
Kevin looks super fast at welter weight. I can see him being a big problem in the next year or two if he takes that division seriously.
How tf did Emmett win his fight? Dude got annihilated lol
A knockout should be an automatic 60k and a sub 45k
Gotta look back but so far fight night/card of the year
Its already been PROVEN that he faked all the superhero stuff, why are people still acting like it wasn't exposed?
Amazing card tonight.   Silva 125 women's, 😳. Holy shyte. Greased lightning, contender.   Knockouts all night. Could barely hear DC and Dom at all a couple times.
Kevin Holland vs masvidal
Love hearing that everyone gets 50k. Awesome fight night.
Kevin looked awesome tonight. The whole card was great. The main event was a solid chess match, but I thought Kattar won. Aside from that, an awesome card.
lol holland beats a bum and is a hero now? he will never be champ or top 10c
the shrooms said he will become champion
2 woman fight, 2 boring decision.. woman divisions is dead division. Valentina,Nunes,Zhang they have a hard job to do this
Dana “This Kid” White
I’m glad they all got 50G’s they deserve it!!! Great fights tonight!!!🔥🔥🔥
I swear win, lose, or draw Kevin Holland is definitely a fan favorite and would be awesome as a comedian when he retires.
This man is really MMA’s *Deadpool*
Donald Cerrone should just fight up and coming contenders to get his last fights to hit 50
I feel like Sean Shelby is gonna take over Dana's position
That d'arch finish was the same way he finished that troll kid lol The troll helped him training for the d'arch 😂
Dans white a few years ago: big mouth Dans white now: isn’t he fucking awesome
Make Nate Diaz vs Cowboy 2 fuck it
*“Isn’t he f**king awesome”* - Dana when he finds out a fighter is marketable lol
W event
I didn't see many roberies like that!
Holland is the new Superhero in da game baby. Dude loves to scrap in the octagon or in da streets or shi**y Italian restaurants at that😂😂😂
It's a record because of inflation budday. But holy shit this card was on fire glad I called in "sick" lmao
Im prolly stupid but why does Dana have dents on his head?
HOLLAND HOLDING IT DOWN FOR RIVERSIDE ONTARIO 💯💯💯💯
Yanez needs a bump up in pay Dana!!
HOLLAND 💯💯💯💯💯
Kev Holl is my favourite ufc fighter rn...
Give him a title shot
A superhero? Why don’t I just say “isn’t he fuckin awesome” u goofball
Dana is fucking saucy
Finally....where this guy been?  🤣👍
Hooyah Dana
