영원럽 뮤비 제일 좋아해… 아프지만 행복했던 청춘 같달까 3:54 나도 여기 너무 예쁘다고 생각했는데 가장 많이 다시 본 장면 뜨는 거 보니까 모아들도 똑같네 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
내 최애곡 이곡으로 입덕함요 멤버들 이거 리액션한거 오늘 처음 알다니 헐...
ㅋㅋㅋ
저는 이 노래를 정말 너무 좋아해요. 가끔 소름이 돋을 때가 있죠😅
4:00
I have seen every reaction video and i can say one thing is permanent SOOBIN CRINGING ON HIMSELF EVERY TIME HE APPEARS ON SCREEN
Beomgyu is the cutest human alive PERIOD.
I'm just curious. Is Kai's hair naturally blond?
I love esp when Huening Kai get praised. He deserves it so much esp how ppl "treat" him in this cruel world. He's so talented and so handsome 🥺  And I just notice when he got compliment there's always Beomgyu the middle child went "how about me" 🥺😅  Bro you are all amazing ❤ Beomgyu you are great too. You are so handsome and l really love your performance. You all deserve so much love and praise ❤  And moa, please support our Hueningie too as much as members.

<3<3
Okay but Hyuka's shirt here ✨️
The way they weren't as loud when Seori was singing so they could hear her voice the first time and then back to the usual chaotic txt when soobin came up, I love them
0:31 범쪽아..
I hope taehyun gets more screen time
0:32 There no kudos for the editor who cut this part!!! I wanted to see Beomgyu mimic Yeonjun part like always!!!
that's bighit level
3:28  Beomgyu’s “this is me 😃👍” 3:32 “This is really fire 🫵”  4:42 “This is like movie😃🫵” I can’t, he’s just naturally funny
Txt's mvs are different
The difference between beomgyu's reaction to blue hour and lovesong is so big, and i am so happy for him, i hope he continues to love himself and know that moas are always here for him❤
I'm upset at soobin for thinking he looks chubby when he's not he's like so perfect it makes me sad when idols don't appreciate theirselves
Thank you so much for the beautiful
*Soobin:* 아  내 배! *Kai, speaking in tiny:* It's tummy... Soobin's tummy~

AMO ESTA CANCIÓN💚
0:31 this is where it started, Beomgyu’s iconic “one and onleyy” and Yeonjun’s headaches 😂😂
I keep coming back not only for the MV, not only for their reaction, but for Kai’s shirt😅😂 It definitely lives in my mind rent free😂🤣🤣
0:31 beomgyu teasing yeonjun again💀💀
Omg I just noticed Huening’s shirt. It’s cool
SOTY!!!!
so obsessed with yeonjun's voice❤❤😘😘😘
kakkokawaii(๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧
lol all moa making theories and even the guys don't know wtf is going on in the mv 💀
누가 빅히트한테 cg좀 알려주세요ㅠㅠ
I'm literally crying
헐 불 cg인줄 알았어 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Hyuka’s shirt is iconic
love u boys !!!! this song is banger 💙💙💙💙💙💥😩
😭😭😍
Beomgyu yeah hhhhhhhh is so funny . He is so cute
Best stan
The MV was way more than decent!  It was so much fun!!!!
Beomgyu diciendo *"this is me"* me da mil años de vida
0:32 the way that they cut Beomgyu  singing Yeonjun’s Part 😭
한국댓이 없어ㅠㅠ
Beomgyu starting to imitate to yeonjun lyrics HAHA.
En las partes donde aparece la cara de soobin Moa: tan cute! Soobin: c muere de cringe
Nice video...
when i see yeonjun wake up alone, i always feel so sad thinking about the theory of yeonjun actually being alone the whole mv ;___;
did they just cut out yeonjun strangling beomgyu for making fun of his rap or smth LOL
AAAAAA
not them saying their next song might be about fish lmao
HUENING KAI'S SHIRT LMAOOO
sir kai , what are you wearing
Can we please talk about how you can see yeonjun's "pabo" side come out here and there and its absolutely endearing. Just like what he said, he may look intimidating but he's actually such a big softy :(( I now understand even better why BG and YJ humor click well. You can watch the 2nd birthday of MOA vlive and this side of him is so clearly shown!  I love seeing the dynamics of members, so far its very clear why this group debuted together. they fit each other so well, im happy I came to find a group like txt! i promised myself that BTS were the last artist I will love and dedicate myself to, but TXT wormed their way into my heart and suddenly from 7 boys it turned into 12 boys occupying my heart. I will be here always in every moment, together forever!
Why is there a “Calamansi” word in the english CC omg HAHAHAHAHAHA
I just loved this song. I could say this is the best song from them so far, like for me. The hook is extraordinary. Kept humming that all the way through even while writing the exams. 😂
huening just said that he noticed the fish appear so often
Beomgyu saying "Ah fu- " and then "This is me" 💀😭
Their best concept elso far!!
pobres, acaso no les dijieron que esa historia se trata de un chico con problemas mentales y que los chicos son sus ilusiones???
TXT music is very comforting and relatable to teenagers(my point of view.)
I feel like TXT music is like mostly to teenagers who are having a hard time.
4:00 수빈아 누가 때렸닠ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 아악 내 배!!!! ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Huening Kai´s shirt tho..
I love v and jk and you
This is my first time I can't look at soobin and taehyun because my trypophobia their shirt is kinda difficult
This song is one of the most emotional song for me can relate
1:41 ohhh..
4:14 Soobin you didn't seem chubby to me tho. Your body proportions are the best.
It’s always beomgyu mocking yeonjun 😂
Beomgyu imitando a Yeonjun 😅
Masterpiece
Anyone noticed hueningkai's shirt?
is that just me, who think, when beomgyu following yeonjun part, there is a part being cut??
4:04 huening saying "soobins tummy" SO CUTE lol
0:31 a new nomenae spEcIal
Maravilhososss🤩🤩❤❤
3:44 OH WAIT THAT WAS A SPOILER LOOK AT THE CAST IN THE MV-
kai's shirt....
El momento en el que Taehyun dijo "El director dijo que si se ponía caliente (El clima por el fuego de la camioneta), corran"  aww, la preocupación del staff por ellos es muy tierna, tal y como un moa <3
They're teasing us HAHAHAHAHA
This song is one of my faves
i love them
esta bellisima uwu
im sorry are we not gonna talk about our angel huening kai's shirt?
0:30 beomgyu is always teasing yeonjun about his parts
Beomgyu :')

I wish they could add some English subtitles too😭
One thing I'm sure the more you look at Taehyun the more handsome he looks
Que hermosos son, ayuda 😭💕

kameranya geter weh bengek wkwkw
Nobody's gonna talk about Huening Kai shirt?
i'm so sorry about this but xD if they hadnt pointed out the fish i would've never noticed lol
when they said there might be hints at the end of the video.... *instantly watching back the m/v
0:31 Burlarse de Yeonjun ya es una costumbre para Beom JAKDKA
相変わらずボムギュのヨンジュンモノマネおもろすぎる笑笑🤣
Hello from AZERBAİJAN 🥰🇦🇿♥️ sizi seviyoruz TXT . 🥺🥺🥺

Are we just gonna ignore heuning's tshirt? Okay.
Soobin to Kai: "you look so good in blonde"  THAT'S TRUE ASF! cant stop looking at Kai since he became blonde. He's so pretty
Huening Kai's Shirt tho... kinda living for it.❤

0:30  Beomgyu will never leave a chance not imitating Yeonjun...

i cannot wait for yeonjun artist of the month performance to be dropped on july 16th! i can just feel another legendary video making its history on the internet !
ilove kai🥺❤️
Gracias Soo Bin por la explicación final y también Yeon Jun por la lectura introductoria.
"if it gets too hot run away" jihfsig so lgugz
Gracias por los subtítulos en español
"Maybe our next song title is about fish"  Looking forward to it 🤡
NETFLIX do your job well come on! HAHAHA
yeonjun,, you're the beta fish!! beta fish can't be around other fish which is why when he woke up he was all alone
4:08 omgg yeonjun saying calamansi~♡
Ellos: ¡Disfruten nuestro nuevo sencillo!  Yo: Dándole todo el amor que merece por que es una joyita<3
“His acting was spicy there”
Que bonitos que son! 😄💙
The saga continues where Beomgyu always mimick the way Yeonjun sings....
não consigo parar de assistir <3
They don't even know what their video is about 💀🤚🏽 Honestly, mood.
"Maybe our next title song's about fish" sgdhfgkrk I cant 😹
Ilove beomgyu

beomgyu's little chime ins are so cute
4:45 Beomgyu 😂
I just watched this whole video and I was like " somethings wrong" then I realized there were no captions on the whole time  👁👄👁
Why does Hyuka look like a main character in an American Netflix Series  Edgy Shirt, blonde hair and everything
Yo seria fan de TXT pero... soy ARMY... seguro estarás pensando "No comentes si vas a decir cosas malas de TXT" o algo así pero... si eres Army y sigues a TXT por favor escucha esto: El 23 de marzo del 2017 no sabíamos que TXT iba a aparecer, lo cual actualmente en 2021 sabemos que es un nuevo grupo de Big Hit, ahora podemos ver claramente como todas las que se hacían llamar "ARMYS" se están yendo al nuevo grupo TXT, ósea que poco a poco se están olvidando de BTS, tristemente es algo que está pasando actualmente. Se esta haciendo realidad el famoso "QUE PASARIA SI DEBUTARA UN NUEVO GRUPO Y OLVIDARAS A BTS" Esta pasando, Por favor ARMYS no olviden a BTS por TXT, no olviden todas las veces que BTS nos hiso reír, llorar, cantar y bailar. Gracias.
انحبكمم
Beomgyu is so cute😂 when he wants soobin to compliment him and when he keeps translating to English. He is so proud of himself and I’m proud of him!
حلو
Yeonjun guiando a sus patitos 3:10 AHHHH TXT eres lo mejor que me pasó en la vida :')  <3 <3 <3 <3

Calamansi XD
Uhh Kai your shirt is amazing. Also love the movie reference with the Lover cast
5:31 عاده يونجون الي قتلتني والي صارت من عاداتي😭🔥🤤🤤
*This is like a movie*  -TXT
The way Beomgyu sang Yeonjun line in the first song of this MV I think he was just always teasing Yeonjun and Moa hahha its going to be a iconic line soon hahha but actually i really love this guys #OT7 check💙
At first glance: "Rock you you rocking rock" haha such boys... *squints* ...waaaaait a second....
Beomgyu baby😭😂❤️ pls keep talking in English
I LOVE KAIS SHIRT
i really like this song, and  i've been singing this song in my mind for the whole week, neverr ending repeat of playing it in Youtube.
삼촌팬이에요~ ㅎㅎ 응원하고 애정합니다^^ RESPECT!
BEOMGYU HAPPILY, FREELY SPEAKING IN ENGLISH WITHOUT WORRYING IS MY SEROTONIN
TAEHYUN SAYING THEM COMING OUT REALLY HANDSOME IN THE MV IS THE MOST IMPORTANT 😂😂😂😂
AAAAND SOOBIN'S BACK TO CRINGING AT HIMSELF 🥺😂😂😂
4:08 as a Filipino I was shocked to hear "calamansi" from yeonjun HAHAHAHAH <3
"ah! seori!" "seori!"  sub : "oh sorry!"
Did yeonjun said calamansi
Cute
Me encantó chicos 😍 Good Job!
Soobin cringing at himself at the pool scene is too adorable haha
how cute
Beomgyu imitando a Yeonjun siempre será icónico XD, ame que tuviera sub español, ustedes se merecen mucho amor y reconocimiento.
¡This is me! Enserió beomgyu no es más tierno porque no puede
yaaa
Calamansi lmao
HUENING KAIS SHIRTTTTT HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAH
I didn’t realize Kai’s shirt.👁👄👁
Lo necesito en Netflix ya
Hyunka seemed EXTRA cute this video, the way he was sitting there with a cute smile he looked so smol I can’tー 😭🥺
범규 handsome guy 😎👈👍
When yeonjun say 'calamansi' what's with that? Calamansi in the pilipinas? Yun ba yon? HAHAHA
The most adorable moment for me was at 5:18 -  Yeonjun was like - Netflixx😁
I love that Heuningkais shirt says F*** YOU YOU F***ING F*** 😭😂
Ohhh my prediction: their next title track will be called FISH, a song that all five of them wrote, with a comedic concept where they make fun of themselves with lightheartedness, with funny lyrics that are aware of what their critics and their haters complain about, and with crazy vocals that go against the expectations of Kpop culture. Wouldn't that be nice...
please reaction Pakistan 🇵🇰 dramas songs
yes this is masterpiece
"ah my stomach"
I just noticed Kai's shirt. 😮  You're not fooling anyone with those strategic rips, stylist-nimdeul. 😆
Beomgyu engliserist
i want huening's shirt  kshakshas
5:34  🦊: I had so much fun driving our members☺️ It was so entertaining whenever they were quivering in fear🥰 🐰: It was pretty scary 🐧: I really wanted to run away😭 LOLL them being scared and Yeonjun having the time of his life💀
Uww so cute. I can feel how they feel when they watch their song
Beomgyu mocking yeonjun again lol
ME ENCANTÓ!!!!!!🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳 MO HICIERON MUY BIEN !!!🤭🤭🇪🇨🇪🇨🥰🥰
MOA: SIIII LOS ABS DE SOOBINNN SOOBIN: ¡MI PANZA!
Yeonjun- 😳😳
beomgyu back at it again
Huhu ganteng ganteng kenapa bajunya bolong bolong sih
I love these babies so much......
Beomgyu getting better @ mimicking Yeonjuns voice 😂
Beomgyu is so freaking adorable. That's it
JAJAJAJA BEOMGYUUU
I was smiling throughout the video like an idiot, ugh I just love them.
Yeonjun is being the cutest softest fluffball throughout this video and I was thinking, wow thats uncharacteristic but adorable, and then he just says "I love when the members were quivering in fear" and I'm like, aha typical Yeonjun, but he does it without breaking his adorable softness and then reverts back to giggling quietly at everything the members say. WTF he has no right to be so devastatingly cute and still manage to look hot at the same time? how tf does he do that. Also we are getting a lot of new iconic memes out fo this video lmao. Gyu and Soobin's random english is HILARIOUS and Kai just scream laughing whenever something he likes happens. Hilarious.
I didn’t realize what Hueningkai’s shirt said until now 😭 that’s so funny
0:31 WHEN BEOMGYU DID THIS I IMMEDIATELY GOT REMINDED OF HIM IMITATING YEONJUN IN BLUE HOUR T.T
احبهم فخوره فيهم

Como Yeonjun nos dice las fans podemos interpretar la cansion libremente y claro que lo hacemos , tenemos muchas teorías de hecho , aunque Taehyung nos dijo que ellos ya conosen la historia de la cansion y el video que es muy profundo, y sé que entre todas las teorías que tenemos MOA hay una correcta solo hay que fijarse en los de totales del vídeo y hay estará la respuesta, Nuestros chicos de TXT siempre hacen cansiones con grandes historias muy profundas con las que nos podemos identificar, en lo personal me identifico mucho con 0X1=LOVESONG (I Know I Love You) , y agradezco la gran cansion , que es arte puro, y siempre podemos aprender mucho de sus cansiones, sobre la vida, y el ejemplo que los chicos nos dan de seguir nuestros sueños es lo más valioso, siempre valoraremos mucho su trabajo, que siempre nos inspira, nos enseña mucho de la vida , nos hace identificarnos con las historias , nos haces emosionarmos y nos hacen muy felices, así que como MOA quería expresar mi profundo agradecimiento a nuestros hermosos chicos por darnos una nueva historia y que para muchas se ha convertido en una cansion que escucharemos todos los días y que cuando nos identifiquemos con la historia nos dará algo de nostalgia pero felicidad a la vez, , 온 마음을 다해 사랑해 늘 응원하겠습니다 ♥️♥️♥️ Beomgyu my bias 💜
I loved their reaction sm :((
"THIS IS ME" lmaoo pls I love him
I thought at first Beomgyu was a quiet type but I don't think I know him yet, he's a super fun and funny person
3:13 Beomgyu:"oh,sorry 3:28 Beomgyu:"this is me" 3:33 Beomgyu:"this is real fire" 4:43 Beomgyu:"this is like a movie"
4:00 depois daqui eu indo ver o MV de novo pra ver a barriguinha do soobin 😂😂
Eu procurando os comentários de fãs Brasileir@s: 🤡🤡
WAIT ANYONE REMEMBER THE TEASER WHEN JUNNIE WAS DANCING ALONE IN HIS ROOM AND THEN IN THE ACTUAL MV THE BOYS ARE TEHRE. MORE EVIDENCE TO BACK UP THE THEORY ABOUT THE BOYS BEING HIS IMAGINATION AHHHHHH
<3
4:00 JAJJAJA me mato la cara de Soobin
Maybe no one noticed (excluding some ) but seori voice is awesome they matched it so well  and bty the mv is super super cool  like really they are like real cool dudes types yk what I mean >.<
Me waking up at midnight and listening to this song again and watching all videos related to this song👁️👄👁️...such a master piece 💥✨
A primera vista de su canción me gustó mucho  y no lo dejo de escucharla  los amo
6:09 im culture shocked... the way nobody flinched
Yeonjun's little "I'm good at driving" was SO CUTE!
Beomgyu is looking sooo coooool 😍😍😍😍
I love u 😘💋😘😘❤️😘 alll
2:25  Beomgyu: “Why don’t you comment on me in the water?” AHAHAHAHAH give him the attention he wants y’all cmon
Why's no one talking about when Yeonjun and Beomgyu talked about  *Calamansi* 🤧 Filo MOAs huhuhu anyone knows why did they mentioned it?
"The director told us to run away if it's too hot and to not get too close to it." What a relationship we had there
"The director told us to run away if it's too hot." What a relationship we had there
Beomgyu with that hairstyle is another level of heart attack
Is he an elf ? Fairy ?  No, he is HUENINGKAI

Watching this in between str3aming Cool,👍
Ok beomgyu copying yeonjuns singing in the beginning will always be funny to me I’m sorry 😂😂

beomgyu, kamuuuu... emmm.. ily ㅠㅠ♡
They're like kids ..we when start to learn something new we show off that often ,  now They're learning English and in all recent videos They're speaking English words 😂 Cutie pies
Taehyun: maybe they’re giving out hints about the next album~ MOA: Taehyun, King of Spoilers
Taehyunie Spill..now!! What's your Twitter account?  I think your account will be like : full of theories,  connection two dots , reposting fancams , spoilers videos,.. Separate account for : Respect to soobin hyung , Ggyu my world , kamal kai my Bestufriendu , Yeounjuniee hyung my great supporter.  😜
calamansi. HAHAHAHA
beomgyuuu soooo cute :(((
It's amazing and beautiful I love you❤❤

BEOMGYU: This is me! 😂
Moas: getting a headache because of the theories Txt: what if our next song will be title as fish?
beomgyu looks so fine ㅠㅠ he was cute during debut and now he's getting more attractive
MOA: *watching the MV trying to make theories  Meanwhile TXT: "We all look handsome in the video" "That's what most important" 😂
BEOMGYU WITH LONG HAIR IS ‼️

After reacting to how many mvs they made, soobin is still cringing when he sees himself😂
If you think that I would walk on a pile of magma and give yeonjun all of my belongings just to touch his masculine hands you would absolutely be right sir 💩
beomie's english is so cute, i can see he is improving💞🥺
Excellent work, I love that song 💗. I'm curious about the video, I think I'll make a lot of theories 😂. Do not forget to take care of hers health🌷
i love how beomgyu is randomly talking in english 😭😭
O Soobin, Taehyun e Kai deram uma passada no Rio de Janeiro... Mas sobreviveram!!

Muy muy lindo tema y bella presentacion
เก่งมากๆ
Ya había visto este video con subtítulos en inglés el día que salió, pero hoy decidí verlo con subtítulos en español y es lo más tierno que hay. Qué bonita traducción les dieron, puesieron cosas como "humito, el agua estaba calentita, sin querer queriendo" y me parece súper adorable. Qué buen trabajo hizo el equipo de traducción al expañol. Fighting!!!
Yeonjun is so cuteeeeeee 😻😻😻 Im Yeonjun biased 👇🏻😈👌
what’s with yeonjun saying calamansi?? how did they know that word?😭😭
I'm soo proud of them, I would upload it every day😘👌  chefs kiss
جونغهون 😞💔

The Beomgyu english agenda is thriving~
Soobin's prominent abs is nowhere to see

Soobin: Where did the doll go? No one: Taehyun: Probably in the storage
0:31 Beomgyu imitating Yeonjun's verse and voice the saga continues HAHA
6:10 “we all look so handsome in the video, that's the most important“  If it's not described who's tubatu then Idk anymore lol
Maybe it's coz of the hair bt i feel like yeonjun lost sme weight this comeback. Maybe it's jst me
huening sumpah lo tau gasih lo ganteng bgtttt
'This is like movie" -beomgyu Yeah, thats really true
"we all look so handsome in the video" "that's what important"  MOA's - when did you all became not handsome????//

연준이 왜이렇게 말랐어....
Yeeeey
Waaaaa
Y el pez su significado es solo para guerreros haciendo referencia que los chicos estaba luchando contra una etapa de sus vidas muy difícil o una persona muy importante para ellos
Y si se sienten fe@s siéntase peor por que la belleza es lo mas importante y no lo digo yo lo dicen TXT tus patrones
OH GOD YEONJUN LOOKS SO GOOD
Taehyun says: maybe our song about fish.. awokwokawok  MOA be like: -_- You guys should know that how many moas  looks for the theory and the meaning of Betta fish, till can't sleep to think about that..

Me encanto el video y la cancion. Todos estuvieron geniales y maravillosos. Me encantan todos sus voces woooooooow *:)*:)*:)*:)*:) " +×+ " *:)
I've been watching them since their debut, but this song & MV finally made me a fan.
You have no idea how BEAUTIFUL the whole album was.
Soobin: I was pretty chubby  Meanwhile, Moa remembering that Soobin has abs even though his only exercise is living and sleeping: 🤡
Beom habla en inglés Automáticamente yo: *llorar y morir* En referencia a los Spoiler: como que la escena al final tiene que ver con el próximo álbum!!!!, Awanten ¿Este Mv tiene muchas pistas?; ¿LOS PECES? HUENING KAI temiendo por su vida cuan Yeonjun conducía jajajajjajaj
Я сразу подумала, что их клип - как короткометражка)) Они, действительно, очень хорошие актёры! И все очень красивые!

Yeonjun with the levi ackerman haircut 👍😭😭😭💓 Bemgyu with the long hiar omg he is so beautiful 💓💓
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT YEONJUN AND BEOMGYU GIVING A SEGMENT OF CALAMANSI!!!!asdffghjkl
HOYYYY ANO MERON SA CALAMANSI!!!!
0:30 I can't with Beomgyu clowning Yeonjun again 😂
ISTG SOOBIN U R NOT CHUBBY. HAVING MEAT ON UR BONES IS A GOOD THING!! Plz stay healthy, weight is just a number and i learned that throughout my troubles with losing and gaining back my weight. Trust me being skinny doesn't make you any happier or beautiful! We love u no matter what Soobin! 💖💖 also its normal to fluctuate in weight because your body needs to change according to it's surroundings to stay in homeostasis (a balanced and healthy body). ✨🌟💖
🐰『僕のお腹が！！！』   ごめんスビン  スクショしちゃった
Beomgyu looks much happier compared to the previous MV reaction! I hope he's feeling better! Also, at 2:25 he asked why no one commented on him, and at 2:29 Soobin complimented him, it made me so relieved that he didn't get ignored. Soobin best leader, Beomgyu best boy <3
JAJAJAJAJA los amo pero me voy a seguir riendo de beomgyu riéndose e imitando a yenjun
4:03 "his tummy, he showed his tummy"  THAT WAS SO CUTE PSLSHSVCZ

Hallo
"Didn't this MV have the most detailed story out of all the MV's we shot so far?" eternally, literally 20 minutes long: I-
*pause to write * huening looks so good with blonde hair
I really loved the parts of the MV where Yeonjun dances alone followed by a scene of him singing softly (it's so beautiful im gonna cry) and their choreo at 3:53 plus a cute version of it 💖💖 This is such a beautiful song 💙
so they literally burned that car^^ hybe being f*cking richhh
Beomgyu was about to imitate Yeonjun but was cut. Yeonjun might've had that part edited out 😂😂  And Soobin cringing at his scenes is so funny 😂 (1:42 and 4:00)
I really really enjoyed the mv and it's music  Thanks a lot TXT !  Please show us more !
see beomgu at 6:12 - 6:22, i want to pity but this still makes me lol

진짜 지친다 스밍좀 돌리라고 이 모아도 아닌놈들아 제발 차트인좀 시키자고 진짜 🐕빡치게 스밍 안돌리면서 모아라고 말하는 놈들 진ㅁ자 후..
VIERON LA DIFERENCIA ENTRE EL BEOMGYU REACCIONANDO A BLUE HOUR Y EL BEOMGYU DE AHORA? SOY... LAGRIMAS, me hace tan feliz que ya se muestre animado x"""""d. Trabajemos duro por los wins MOAs, en twitter hay calendarios, y de hecho uno de google por si no tienen twitter, siéntanse libres de pedirmelo
0:32 copying yeonyun.. again😂😂
I CANT STAND BEOMGYU LMAOOO 😭😭😭😭😭😭

Spill baju kalian😭
WE ALL KNEW THAT PRINCE BEOMGYU WILL IMITATE YEONJUN'S VOICE AGAIN HAHAHAHA
연준이랑 태현이를 제외하곤 다른 맴버들은 데뷔 후 2년이 넘는 시간동안 포텐이 터진다는 느낌 없이 제자리 걸음인 것 같고 특히 수빈이 범규는 무대나 콘텐츠를 보면 고구마 먹은 느낌이 들게 해 안타깝다  맞지 않는 옷을 입고 흉내만 내는 느낌, 중간만 가고 만족하는 느낌이 들어 팬으로서 기운 빠질 때가 있다 열정이 없는 건가 끼가 없는 건가 방법을 모르는 건가 속도가 느린건가  치열한 남돌세계에서 늘 어리둥절하고 힘빠져있는 두 사람 좀더 화이팅 해주면 좋겠다  다행인건 올봄부터 나온 콘텐츠들을 기점으로 뭔가 파이팅 넘치는 모습 적극적인 모습이 보인다는 것. 좀만 더 잘하면 좋을 것 같은데 뭔가 늘 어설퍼 보여서 아쉽다
beomgyu speaking eng lines is so cute
Soobin:"ah my stomach"  Bin lu tau gak, gw panas dingin woy. Hueee 💜
in this video beomgyu speaks english a lot, we like that hahaha💞
BEOMGYUS ENGLISH IS SO CUTE OMFG IM DYING

Beomgyu is clowning yeonjun Again😭 He sang Yeonjun part I'm crying
Beomgyu clowing Yeonjun again.... I can't with this boy!
TXT 💙💙💙💙💙 HYBE 👌👏👍💙 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽    HYBE se agradecen los subtítulos 😁
Paul must see this.🤡
やっぱりスビンがリーダーだなぁ
Beomgyu translating everything in tiny 🥺
Are we just gonna ignore what Huening's shirt says 😅😂
What to expect when watching TXT reacting to their MV Huening being mesmerized by the whole MV Taehyun saying things that they see on the set Beomgyu's sudden english and clowning the members Yeonjun praising everyone Soobin being embarassed when his face is shown 👀
Beomgyu's english always got me HAHAHAH
FISH 😂😂😭
When Soobin praise Huening as he looks good in blonde then Beomgyu ask Soobin why he didn't say good comment about him in water, after seconds Soobin really say Beomgyu looks good too😭 this kind of hyung and leader is what I want✊
This is sooo beautiful  I can’t explain my feeling I listen to this
0:31 Seems like Beomgyu is ready to beat his iconic "feEl liKee ciNderEllA naega byeonae" and "nanneumune spUsyull" 😭 Someone save YJ from this kid
how can Beomgyu just sit there and still manage to be handsome as hell
5:20-왜 그는 단지 "넷플릭스"라고 너무 귀엽다
Can we all just admire Hyuka's shirt for a min lol!
4:00 *"Ah, my stomach!"*  - soobin, 2021
I can’t get over Hueningkai’s shirt LMFAO. #relatable😝🙄🙏
CHOI YEONJUN WHAT WAS THAT AT 5:31 OMG stop killing mee

Yes,me is fish- who summon me-
Beomgyu never fails to mock and entertain, lol “yOuR mY oNe AnD oNlY~” “Yeeeaaaahhhhhhh” “Oh, sorry” “This is me!” “This is real fire” “i WaSn’T tRyInG tO~” “This is like a movie”
why does gyu look so smol T^T
beomgyu's english is the cutest thing ever
CALAMANSI
"it was so entertaining whenever they were quivering in fear" ;D
That was a real fire? WOAHHHH. That's so coooool
MOAS MENTAL NOTE: TAEHYUN SAID: "This is a spoiler, how the doll, could be hidden"  Taehyun lives to spoil the fandom and doesn't know it! Ha ha ha
#choibeomgyu 🥰❤️
yeonjun's arms are so thin???
Not Soobin being embarrassed about accidentally showing his stomach because he thought he was pretty chubby at the time they filmed the MV 😭. Soobin, you aren’t chubby! Your perfect! And showing your stomach was very cute!!!
I suddenly remember beomgyu in their reaction on blue hour i guess he feels so much better now😊
beomgyu's random bursts of english phrases is sendING ME IDK WHY SKJDHF
When you got triggered not because of how Soobin 'Accidentally' exposed his 'sToMacH' but because of Yeonjun's "cALaManSi"-
HUENINGKAI’S SHIRT KILLED ME— it just like surprised me but it’s hilarious💀 him:💗🐻 🌸 His shirt:⛓💥◾️👹
The doll , the fish, the cat eyes. TXT don't even know about the theories🤣🤣🤣Bighit let MOA get overthinking 'bout it and the boys didn't even know about those editing help meeee

Moa: making many theories Txt: FISH   HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
Beomgyu’s talent: clowning yeonjun’s part

SOOBIN: where the doll go?  Taehyun: probably in storage. END
More Beomgyu iconic English:  "Oh, sorry!" "This is me!" *2 thumbs up XD* "This is real fire!" "This is like movie!" We love you English king, go off Edit: misspelled 'movie' like a noob
Walang sub😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

"This is ReAl fIrE"-beomgyu
Can someone spread to other platforms to s+re@m? Our hourly views is less than 100k, and our gap with our biggest competitor is already at 3.2M. I swear if we lose our chances on winning on music shows AGAIN because of our s+re@ms  ps. I'm kind of restricted already at instagram (the only platform I have aside from YT and twitter) because I've already spammed all MOA fanpages I know to put some sense into MOAs
Gracias hybe por acordarte de l@s fan latinoamericanos y españoles

"maybe our next title song's about fish" HAHAHAH pleaseeee
NETFLIXXXXXX
0:32 LMAO BEOMGYU MOCKING YEONJUN AGAIN. the saga continues
as a baby MOA this was my first CB and I'm so happy ❤️
When Huening said that, that’s the doll on Yeonjun’s scene it reminded me of the teaser they put on TikTok where Yeonjun was wearing a mask. What if that was the doll and it has developed? What if the doll is Yeonjun??? Probably like in this MV Yeonjuns is going through pain because of his parents arguing, then him escaping with the members. But it was all just a dream. So he is left all alone, that kind of pain. Just like the doll has a lot of pains. What if instead of all the members receiving the pain from their identity it’s actually Yeonjun receiving both his pain and all the members combined. Just like he was receiving the pain all by himself on the doom’s night trying to save his members.
Next generation of their hyung BTS ❤❤❤❤❤
I love how they're always free talking about what's on their minds lol
yeonjun cute
Jajajajjajaja ay no, yo me agito mucho viendo las reacciones jajaja
Soobin: I was pretty Chubby  Meanwhile him having abs but his exercise is only breathing: 🤡

Vamos chicas sigamos con el stre4m. Siquiera cumplámosle el deseo a los chicos de ganar el premio de  music bank. Enserio les digo que estoy un poco desanimada por que casi no van a ganar muchos premios, pero todavía tengo esperanza de que logremos ganar el de music bank. Para que eso pase tenemos que seguir haciendo sre4m en su mv( recuerden que este premio no se consigue con las votaciones, lo único que podemos hacer es ver el mv)
Me encante mucho recién soy fans desde que una canción de ellos me encantó mucho y averigüe más de ellos
me... getting storyline and theory dreams these days🤡
why did he say "calamansi"?
BEOMGYU YOU ARE SO PERFECT
BeomGyu imitó a YeonJun otra vez, tengo miedo de escucharlo a él ahora como con Blue Hour.😭

Beomgyu 🛐

4:54 "Didn't this MV have the most detailed story out of all the MV's we shot so far?" MOA THEORISTS ARE SHAKING IN OUR BOOTS

Beomgyu is so cute.
Yes it should be released on Netflix
I just now noticed heuning Kai's  shirt lmao
they put a lot of effort, i’m so proud of them :,)
I love Kai's shirt "F**K YOU, YOU *OCKING F**K"
Left to right is Beomgyu, Yeonjun, Soobin, Taehyun, Huening Kai. I think the mv was really good.
Wait when Beomgyu said "sorry" isn't that "Seori" the featured artist???   I know Beomgyu said "Seori" but the subtitle said "sorry" 😭😭😭
beomgyu checking yeonjun's ear in the end to see the little freckle he has makes me so soft and for no fucking reason
2:24 beomgyu is again asking for soobin to compliment him too ahaha aw, someone should make a compilation... i’ve seen too many instances
<3 -3-
"maybe our next song is about fish" Depois do spoiler do Taehyun sobre cntysm eu tô de olho em tudo
Soobin saying “ur acting is so spicy” got me dead lol and I love how they speak English in between, it’s definitely improving and I’m proud 😩
ayuda, aún no entiendo las teorías JAJAJAJAJA
Guys look at their pretty cute little happy faces watching the MV and their comments about the MV you can tell  they are literally so happy and excited for this comeback and they obviously want people to appreciate their ART , let's pls work harder for the YouTube views we are doing so well on spotify almost all tracks on freeze already achieved 1M+ streams on spotify and the title track already have 3,2M streams in two days this means our fandom grew so much since minisode1 era so what is happening with our youtube views don't make sense specially if you see the likes and views ratio it's obvious that something is wrong with youtube algorithms the problem is not us but youtube still pls don't get discouraged and keep streaming no matter what we need consistency like we did with blue hour and remember we already achieved almost all our goals except for youtube but don't let youtube discouraged you we are doing the best that we can and we are also breaking many other records , YouTube is like the biggest obstacle right now so pls let's stay focus and don't stop streaming on both youtube and spotify . You all are doing such a good job and working so hard and I know the guys know and appreciate that so pls keep encouraging each other , let's give our boys more than 3 wins this comeback I know the competition is hard but nothing is impossible if we work together. Our fandom on Twitter amd our fanbases there alre saying that we can give txt at least 4 wins (on 4 different music shows ) if we keep streaming, collecting votes and buying the album  let's show our boys how much we appreciate their hardwork and their music figthing MOA !
For those Filipino yeonjun said calamansi
Txt : Fish , doll  Meanwhile  Moa : 👁👄👁 Clown imnida
NETFLIX PLEASE RELEASE THIS FUCKING SONG BECAUSE THEY DESERVE IT. TXT

how beomgyu attempts to mock yeonjun's rap part in ever comeback is something so valuable to me LMAOOO.
I don't approve of the message on HK's shirt.
I’m hoping everyone caught taehyun saying there were hints for the next album in the MV and also why the hell is soobin saying he’s chubby
0:30 seconds in the video and beomgyu already starts clowning yeonjun hahahahahahahahahaha

4:00 Soobin really said " AH, MY STOMACH" like that LMAO is he just finding out his cute abs made a cameo on the mv? that's so funny to me
Hey , quiero que soobin sepa que está perfecto y que no diga que está gordito por qué no lo está !! Dios , que alguien le pegue por mi , Beomgyu haceme el favor de pegarle por mi !
We love it! Beomgyu doesn't need to fish for compliments, we really do love it!
Bg:"Why don't you comment on me in the water?" The members : *doesn't react on him *
i'm so happy they really seemed pleased with the music video and their acting skills,, to pay back for their hardwork let's stream the mv harder and also don't forget to enjoy while doing so!🥺💙
4:00 LMAO Soobin really exclaimed OH MY STOMACH lyjrsgadfghgpiurgb He didn't know until now that it made a cameo in this mv ? I can't I just ahhahahaha
1:43 Remember when Soobin used to cringe everytime he saw himself in the mv look at him now I’m so proud 😂😭
Soobin diciendo que está gordito:    Automáticamente yo : no estás gordito , estás perfecto , precioso , eres la perfección en persona

1:58 these boys are just as confused as us about the fishes in the mv or even more clueless 😭😭💀
you guys should stop speaking at the same time like that when recording/shooting for anything... :""") the audio kept overlapping, I bet it was very hard writing for the subtitle transcript
Los chicos saben que moa no puede captar los spoilers entonces ellos mejor no los dicen gkwkfkskdjdks
BEOMGYU'S ENGLISH COMMENTARY THROUGHOUT THE VIDEO MADE MY HEART SO WARM I SWEAR I LOVE HIM SO MUCH

moas' research : the fish symbolized depression and loneliness txt : wow there's fish!! maybe our title song is abt fish :)
to be honest when they said it felt like a movie I really thought that I was watching stranger things, they would be really good actors if they were in it
No one literary no one - normal people real reaction  TXT - i can see menu over there  Jajjsngmeon =________ won
Beomgyu so handsome
Yeonjun just randomly said Calamansi so cutelyvduhdsvflf
4:32 nadie va a hablar del musculo de yeonjunnie 😳🤙
I really love the change like the whole little emo look, and the songs of this album remind me of pop rock sort of (?) it's all really great
Beomgyu throwing out english phrases whenever he can lols

Beomgyu speaking English in tiny is so cute!
Mv is so beautiful thank you so much for  beautiful song
0:32 beomgyu 😭😭😭
ok so my theorists are not gonna comment on these?  'was it a dream' 'wasnt it before the fire?'  'run away had a nice story too'  This means all the mvs might not even be connected and that the timeline is not only messed up by albums but also mvs and the sequence of the mvs is also not linear Someone save me my head hurts it just exploded. TT.TT
S P I C Y 🔥🔥
WHAT WAS THE CALAMANSI COMMENT FOR?!?!!?

I laughed so hard at Soobin's reaction to his stomach showing in the video. Pls he is the cutessst
Yeonjun : I had so much fun driving our members. It was so entertaining whenever they were quivering in fear. Members : Scared laugh lol
4:03   huyka saying  "it's tummy, Soobin's tummy" 🤣

Hahaha 1:42 soobin and his never ending “cringe” face on his solo parts 😂
*1:43** Soobin cringing over himself its the funniest thing HAHA*
Moa please take a second to read this  I think the mv is about yeonjun having abusive parents, which then gave him mental illness. You can see he is wearing a hospital tag in one of the scenes. He thought he was having fun with his friends but it was all a hallucination due to his illness, that's why he wakes up and the car is not burnt.
I like your song.... I never to hear that song
Nobody gon talk abt the fact that Kai's shirt has the f word on it twice.... actually thrice...
6:23 moa si lo vio muchas veces:'))) todo mal con youtube-.-

Siento que nos están diciendo en la cara que nos estamos listas para lo que sigue (inserta sticker de payaso)  ¡Son los reyes de la 4ta. Generación de eso no hay dudas!

This is me (2021) Beomgyu
ph moas, did you see the sub where it says CALAMANSI? hahahaah also soobin's stomach.
Ok- Beomgyu's new iconic line: "This is real fire"
Am I the only filo moa who got shook when Taehyun said “Calamansi” in 4:10 with the captions on?😆
Don't worry Soobin I close my eyes when you accidentally showed us your tummy.
yeonjun filo
Yes we know that Hybe doesn't use any graphics, that's real FIRE.
The staff literally changed the subtitles from Seori to Sorry, i can't------
And the saga of soobin getting embarrassed by his solo shots continues. Also ‘ah my stomach!’ Hahahahaha I died

It's really scary how they grew up so fast, especially Hyuka😭. Bro, these are the same boys who performed cat and dog😭💕.
Please we want Beomgyu clowning Yeonjun's part again🤣
1:08 / 2:20 *beomgyu calling himself pretty and asking others to compliment him in the water is my favourite thing* 😂👏
2:03 This is exactly how I predicting their title track for the next album lol
CALAMANSI??

Love you guys so much...
Yeonjun I am distracted 😭
Not at them saying that maybe their next title song will be about FISH 😭✋
CALAMANSI
3:10 i really thought it was taehyun's voice🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️😂😂
hueningkai’s shirt has tape on it jajdcjjxjd😂😂
not bighit misspelling "seori" to "sorry" in the captions 💀
Beomgyu during Blue Hour era: "Naneun naman speciar hanapunine speciar" Beomgyu this era: "Yur ma wan en only"~ I cant-😂
look how happy they're, we should happy streaming too
終於看到他們熱血""衝勁"" 這樣真的可往上位拚拚 真的好感動喔 TXT最常被人說到少了這一股勁，現在終於有出來了 之後就是持續這勁+提升實力多唱live，未來指日可期

Netflix release it already
Them imitating their own song is a thing for them ksks
beomgyu clowning yeonjun: a saga  'nEoNeUn nAmaNui SpEciAL' 'mY oNe aNd oNLy'
4:08 Yeonjun: Calamansi And beomjun after that is so cute
Beomgyu imitando a yeonjun jajajajaja si que le gusta fastidiar a Yeonjun
Está en español ;)
It's Yeonjun's voice
MOA : wondering about what the fish means for  TXT : We don't even know. Maybe that's our next song's name.
ENGLISH BEOMGYU IS BACK Y’ALLS
BEOMGYU IS SO ADORABLE 😭
*Ok, but Huening Kai's shirt tho.* The very meaningful message it says. It touched my heart.
3:59, just a little reminder for those who keep screenshoting and posting Soobin's abs... He's not so comfortable about it.
1:43   Soobin's reaction 😂
Beomgyu imitates yeonjun voice again lmak i hope we get full version
But Soobin you weren't chubby at all 😭 I actually thought he looked thinner in the MV
'WOW BEOMGYU'....hehe yup same here wow-
Felicidades por los 10M ( ◜‿◝ )♡
Guys.... Look at Kai's shirt...
Fact is: Yeonjuns parts will never stay in peace with beomgyu😭
THE DOLL!? EVERYONE, GO TO THE MV TO CHECK IT OUT
♥️🙆‍♀️♥️
Why do I think Beomgyu and Yeonjun said 'Seori' not 'Sorry' in 3:12. The word 'sorry' doesn't make sense at all in the context hahaha
Soobin: I didn't want to show my stomach! MOA: Don't worry love we are not complaining
Yeonjun (5:33) - I had so much fun driving our members Also Yeonjun - It was so entertaining whenever they were quivering in fear 😂
Beomgyu speaking English is adorable
Yeonjun tolong kondisikan lengannya😭💙
There's a fish in the MV? I str3am the MV like a hundred times but I didn't saw it? 😭
Can I also say, Blonde Kai looks even more like his dad and I'm crying 🥺
What was it about calamansi in 4:07?
CALAMANSI WORLD DOMINATION PH MOA'S WON AGAIN
not at Soobin saying "cute" to himself-  (?)
Vamos por más, si se puede Moa !!!
not at how beomgyu singing yeonjun’s verse in yj’s voice 😭
the mv isn't like a movie at all… IT! IS! a movie!
they are so perfect </3
TXT
Love you all
TXT: Maybe our next album is about Fish Soobin: Fish~
The way they say seori but in english accent: Txt:Oh sOrRy yeah SoRrY
i love them <3
They keep not giving Beomgyu much reactions because they love teasing him 😂 And members know if you do praise BG, he would start annoying them in response 🤣  Nevertheless, I wish they would give the baby the reaction he is wanting 🤧
I love so much 💙
♡Tan Hermosos Únicos TXT♡
c a l a m a n s i
Beomgyu teasing Yeonjun on how he sings will never not be funny
I can't believe until Yeonjun and Beomgyu telling us that It's real fire
Ay pero que hermosos que se ven :'3, son tan tiernos muy tiernos
Netflix allá te voy ,sin miedo al éxito
Hueningkai: “oh, there might be hint in this scene, I think its the doll”  Soobin: “we didnt see that for awhile, where did the doll go?”  Taehyun being savage: “the doll? Probably in the storage”
Hueningkai is looking damn fine in blonde

4:29  why is no one talking about the fact that Beomgyu saw a mole on Yeonjun`s ear in MV and decided to check it out right away   aww that`s cute

Them speaking English at random times is so cute 😂
0:31 I got a vision of neOnuN nAmaNe SpEsYonG's future sibling
It isn't a TXT video without spoilers for the NEXT album 😭😭😭
They burnt house and a car. Green screen who?
This reaction made me so happy TvT I have a theory with the fish: since one of the lyrics is “Now I can’t stop thinking ‘bout you when I’m sinking alone”, maybe the fish represents how the person they are singing about saved them from sinking, so now instead of sinking they are swimming like a fish would!
When Taehyun said "Maybe they're giving out hints about the next album" we are clown again😌
love this, remember to str3am the mv moas!
Okay let's talking about the next title track "F I S H"
PLS BEOMGYU'S ENGLISH IS SK CUTEEES
I like how the first thing he thinks of when he sees the fish is the quality-
I swear 0X1 LOVESONG needs to get viral
and the beomgyu teasing yeonjun line era continues
*the fish appears so often* *mybe our next title song's about fish* 💀💀💀💀
Less than a minute in the video and we already got some clowning *pLEASE* And they're finally making theories but also clowning us--
