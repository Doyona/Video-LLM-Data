I’m pretty sure it was a Forward pass on hulls first try
Would appreciate if you didn’t give away the result in the video title, for those who don’t want it spoiled…
Great try by the young flying Fijian 🇫🇯
Well done Cas score after 50 seconds then play like you don’t care for next 76 minutes . The attack was disappointing at best. This game to last week was a million miles apart
