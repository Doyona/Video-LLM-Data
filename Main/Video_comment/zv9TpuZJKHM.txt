I remember this during covid
When Randy defended against Drew it should have been a triple threat with The Fiend to see who would have represented Raw against Roman
1:11
Creative staff shouldn't let Randy drop the belt back to Drew so that Randy vs. Fiend at Wrestlemania was a wwe title match
For the first time the fiend just standing and watching
We miss seeing Alexa Bliss & Randy Orton on TV so much. Hope they come back soon in 2023 or 2024
The Fiend is Joker and Alexa Bliss is Harley Quinn of WWE. RIP Bray Wyatt, we'll always miss you as the most craziest creator ever in wrestling history.
RIP the fiend
2020 is the best
RIP Wyatt
Mcintyre is wild
Drew vs. Orton vs. Fiend 🔥
Ha, Randy was like better the devil you know
Alexa
Why
Bring back Tom Phillips too!
This is one of my favorite moments. Made Orton choose who he wanted fight. I love stuff like this. Multiple feuds at once
Should of been a triple threat for the title but at least bray is back now and will be done better
Like
Hmmmm
Omaygat ooo
Alexa is Sexy, Hot, Adorable, Cute, Sweet, Strong, Determined, Talented, Unique, Beautiful, Fabulous, Gorgeous.

So much potential with this yet wwe dropped the ball
Randy do a rko
I don't really know why but I want to see Drew McIntyre vs The Fiend at Summerslam so bad
To whoever is reading this Jesus is coming soon repent and turn away from your sins before its too late
I miss The Fiend, he must have a match against Bobby Lashley for The WWE Championship
A little late.the company and I am a chance to get my text messages that was a few days,the more than a lot keep in mind Todd him know you know that is your mom and ally Austin to be an email
Bliss is not under the control of The Fiend. She's just thinking that she is.
Call the polish on the guy
Hi Randy the find it was brun
I thought drew was the champ until he lost at elimination chamber.
Bu kız kadar wwe de tatlı kız yok  buna kim kıyar ki
drew  mclntyre is a noob
They should banned the fiend and Alexa Bliss
Drew macintyre is awesome so is randy orton and bray wyatt to
You make me wrestler
I could care less about what anyone says at all, i would be down to watch a fight between "The Fiend" And Drew Mcintyre
Is back Fastline 2021
1:11 wwwttfffff
vamos demonio
where is the fiend? oh randy you just HAD to ask huh?
she just a little girl! lol too young for a talk show host
The fiend and mcintyre feud would be kinda interesting
Вот что нам нужно. Вот эти кадровые моменты нужны нам аудитории...
HARLEY QUINN
I know that drew mcintyre and the fiend face each other!
WWE
Awesome
Dgjydui uu + How are you
This looks idiotic. I am not talking about the storyline but I am not a great fan of that either. But the pandemic match wrestling really bad.
I love Alexa 💟💚💛💜💙
I'm using VPN to view this video 😠. Stupid wwe blocks video in INDIA
The Fiend and Alexa Bliss Winner Royal Rumbe 2021
1:55, it looks like ghost white eyes on the right
Nice
What's with Harley Quinn over there?
عدوه طويله
Alexa bliss looks like a 18 year old when she laughed
تروح حاحا
The fiend just appeared right behind of the viper randy orton and just annoying it and when on fighting drew mcintyre
What if while he threw the things from the set he hit a computer 💀

I want a Penta vs Fiend Feud . 0 M vs the True Self.
Alexa is so cute.
Alexa Bliss is so over now she doesn’t need a championship to be a star.
I love Alexa 😘😍👑👍👏
It’s funny how the feind kicked out of ten curb stomps at 1 every single time but gets pinned be a jackhammer ( really a suplex)
i think alexa bliss crazy i think so

Raw: Alexa vs Nikki Raw: Alexa vs Lacey Survivor Series: Alexa Attacks Asuka/ Raw: A Moment of Bliss Alexa Attacks Asuka TLC: Alexa vs Asuka
When did Bliss join the fiend
I like the fiends
Randy Orton literally has 4 targets on his back.   • The Fiend/Bray Wyatt wants revenge because Randy burned down the Wyatt Family Compound  • Drew McIntyre absolutely has plans of getting his WWE World Title back  • The Miz is Mr. Money In The Bank, and he’s got John Morrison on his side to help him blindside Randy whenever he’s defenseless  • Roman Reigns is Randy’s opponent at Survivor Series, and who knows if or when he’ll invade Raw to threaten and attack Randy in order to make a statement about who the better champion is?
I feel like they should give the fiend something special like undertakers streak
0:06. Beautiful.
The find lets go

Key words in this was he knew bray watt better then anyone but he doesn’t know the fiend that’s why he went towards drew he knows drew and what he comes with

Drew McIntyre stop dirty had a good title ring get over it please I wish Brock Lesnar being you are WrestleMania 36
Good voice
😱😱😱😱😱🌜🤕😈😈
The fiend is a joke!!!!!  After washed-up Goldberg whooped him easily, the Fiend lost all credibility.
WWE is lie
Drew and fiend work together perfectly love it
Need to stop cutting the clips
They shoudve casted Alexa bliss for Harley Quinn lmao
Not Going to lie Who Else finds Randy Orton’s voice a bit calming
One of the worst gimmicks EVER!!! Need to come up with his own entrance instead of stealing undertaker disappearances tactic
Drew is a sore loser Randy is a legend he deserved it
predictable
0:30 Burned the house  means when randy burned wyatts house before wrestlemania. Fiend never forgets
Orton is the goat. His acting is just incredible and he is the true final boss of wee.
Tá namorando
LOOK LOVE 💘❤  ALEXA  AND FIEND LOVE YOU TOO
Please wwe book Randy orton vs sister abailgail in a falls count anware match for the wwe for the championship
Y’all burn the house ! Epic

I love Alexa 💟💗💝💖💟 Sexy  Hot  Beautiful Awesome
Garbage
WWE has made The Fiend overrated. He is not good, don't deserve the role he is in.
I like when the fiend just appears out of nowhere and plus it is so scary the light just goes off
MR  ORTON    turns  and  faces  THE  LESSER  OF  TWO  EVILS            HE  IS  HERE      LET  ME  IN
next episode Alexa dressed as a sexy Vampire o sexy witch. Sexy Halloween. 😍😘😳🔥😈👑
Abb to get the other one I know of a good day
Something that made me laugh is, what if Randy Orton asked, "Where is The Fiend?" And The Fiend comes outta nowhere and just yeets Randy Orton or snaps his neck on the spot. Or when The Fiend was behind him what if The Fiend pushed him towards Drew McIntyre And Drew ClayMores Randy Orton. XD
Soy el único que habla español?😕😕😕
Oh I know we can have a triple threat match
Looks have Alexa Bliss sitting exactly match her personality
Orton won clean though   Why is Drew attacking him?
*Me as a dad beating up my son's 10 year old bully*
Randy winning the title and Him vs The Fiend going to WM is what I called from the day The Fiend was drafted to Raw.
I wouldn’t turn around either 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Randy will beat roman then he will beat drew and he will beat the fiend and then he will lose the wwe championship to edge
Randy orton has being targeted by roman bray edge drew
there fake hitting why
Is it just me or the 'Legend Killer" gimmick is slowly disappearing
Burned the house down I thought it was Seth Rollins but I now realized that it was a callback when Orton burned the wyatt compound im an idiot lol
The fiend: damn can I get a coffee I’m bored
Alexa bliss look like joker girl
Whoever loves Randy Orton like here 👇
No time for monster lol 😂
Man, Orton boutta punt Bray Wyatt so hard he's gonna revert to Husky Harris.
Randy Ortan “ there it is burn 🔥 the house down” Where is the Fiend! Great story telling, how Randy wouldn’t even look at The fiend directly. Then decided he didn’t want to face him because to scared!
Million Dollar questions Can Fiend be like next Boogeymen or undertaker
Best thing going in wwe
drew stab randy orton eye with a pen
The WWE doesn't treat Randy Orton fairly anymore. The only reason why they accepted to give him that title is so that he could lose to roman reign.
Quiero  ver smakdaun en vivo
He should rko Alexa bliss
you know wrestling was getting worse by the day when the soundtrack is 10x louder than the pre-COVID real audience...
Alexa and Bray the beauty and the Beast Chucky (Bride of Chucky) The purifiers of “The night of judgment Pennywise
Never thought id say this but im going for orton
0:20 Burn In My Light
Everyone happy halloween
Man Drew is so stiff can't sell the punches or the beatings he takes. You would want to move beyond the older times but for god sakes bring some fluidity in your sells so that the current product also becomes watchable.
الحلبة بدون جمهور ليست لديها لا فورجا ولا مصداقية وشكراً
Who is the best  Like: Alexa Dark Lady  Comment: Alexa Fun house
Am I the only one to notice Randy looked like he was in a trance then he started slowly walking towards drew
Randy Orton @ 0:49 : "Where is the fiend?" Me @ 2:12: "Behind you!"
even orton the viper fear to turn and face the fiend wow. i think it will be a 3ple threats match orton mcintyre thw fiend

This can be a classic triple threat match for the wwe championship
The fiend is nothing compared to masked Kane 1997 😂
انى ابن عم ماكنتاير
Please can we have wwe in England now
Now raw is better than smackdown
So is Randy gonna be a face now?
Fiend vs Orton Vs McIntyre
randy vs drew vs bray vs the miz I want to see.
No one gonna talk about how stunning Alexa Bliss new look/attitude  is ?
Круто
these days heals are like faces Lol.  Roman is a heal but 2-3 faces needed in order to beat him Randy is a heal but 2-5 faces needed in order to beat him  Randy lost the Ambulance match only because it was like 4 vs 1 lol
Soft Punches and Easy Landings.... Lame
“The Fiend"Bray Wyatt is new face   of Monday Night RAW
Loving the Fiend and Alexa Bliss storyline, I want Liv Morgan and Nikki Cross be traded to the opposite shows. I could see Liv team with Alexa for the Women's Tag Team Titles.  Hope that Drew gets to have his second big moment as Champion in front of live audience soon. Question is if the crowd will already grow tired of him like they did with Cena and Rollins? They need to be more careful when booking McIntyre
Next week retribution will team up the fiend like nothing happened the week before
👍
Me: trying to watch a video on WWE’S YouTube channel  Montez Ford: Now we have the SMOKE!
I thought Fiend would cost Drew the title at HIAC. Is Fiend at face?
Randy Orton Mr RKOBOO Doesn't Deserve tobe A Chamo Because She Can't Beat Any New WWE superstars
Drew McIntyre deserve more Title Than Randy Orton
Drew McIntyre deserve Rematch From mister RKBOOO
You defeat Drew Not Jinder
I HATE YOU RANDY ORTON YOU ARE A CHEATER
RANDY ORTON SUCKS
Bliss is sooo cute omg
I stopped watching WWE for 10 years. The Fiend, Randy, and the great story line is the only thing that brought me back.
Sexy
Bellissima. 😍😘
Yawdu أشهد القلو
0:55 0:56.  Beautiful.
Get him bray get him win for  bliss get Orton
Orton is an excellent heel and sells the gimmicks so good.
Randy's title reign is in big trouble... Drew wants his rematch, Bray Wyatt wants his revenge from 3 years ago and Miz is hunting with the briefcase
Nice storyline !
City of Bliss.  👑😍😘😳💜💛💚🔥😈💯💣👏👍✌💞💖💕💓
Randy Orton: “yeaaa, I’m just gonna take this L”  Damn, that’s an awesome look 😃 I need that mask 😂
I love how randy doesn’t turn completely around and just slightly turns his head and the camera zooms in on the fiend and his tongue sticking out and staring down then randy breaths a sigh then picks drew. Classic! Undertaker will never be replaced ever but the fiend is the closest as opposed to creepy music and spontaneous moments that really gets the fans into it.
I thought Randy wasn't scared of The Fiend  ? 🤔😆 as didnt bother to turn around  goes to fight Drew instead
ALEXA BLISS 0:33 0:33 0:35 0:05 0:06 0:07 0:08 0:10 1:25 1:26 1:46 1:47. 1:48 😍😘😳💚💛💜💚💛💜😳😘😍

Dont give the title to the fiend, give the womens champion to alexa, this is good markting
RANDY ORTON GOING TO DESTROY THE FIEND
Where is Jinder Mahal so he can beat Randy again.
The Fiend doesn't forget Randy
Yo she fits this role perfectly and her facial expression when she says something how she can switch it like that is perfect deff agree dont ruin this story line
There were 2 camera cuts every second. I didn't even see what just happened.
ok this is perfect, Orton and Drew are big guys who can really wrestle and deliver amazing matches, Bliss and Wyatt are the most gifted performers in WWE, gimme them over Leto and Robbie,
I love Alexa Bliss even more in this angle than I did before. She looks like she’s actually having fun with it.
Alexa looks like a walking talking tasty strawberry ice cream
Alexa Looks So Cute, Amazing Blue Eyes.
😄😄👍👍👍
Yes.mcntaire
God the fiend orton fued is gunna be so good
I see The Fiend soon turning on Drew. He is standing in his way to retain what he had lost. Let's watch the space.
Randy on the ramp is like, "Do I want to fight a guy who puts his hand in my mouth or fight a guy who kicks the mouth?"
That Drew McIntyre look back at Bliss after throwing the set 😅 "mind if i throw out all these stuff?"
This should have been a triple threat Hell in a Cell match
Who thinks samoa joe is coming back that would be great!
Bliss is so cute
1:07
Unpopular opinion: FEED ME MORE
This storyline is fantastic!!!! WWE, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE,for the love of God, DO NOT RUIN IT. Its the only reason I've come back to watching WWE again.    and ps keep The Fiend as the invincible entity he is. He should be that one "superstar" no one can beat.
2017: Randy is part of the Wyatt family 2020: Wyatt starts to get payback for Orton burning his house
This makes professional wrestling look even more fake
I think the find is the new undertakers i hope the find will take undertakers' legacy at wrestlemania
If McIntyre is a face, why would he help the heel in the fiend?
I'm wondering if anybody is getting a 2005 flashbacks to when undertaker creeped up behind Randy Orton in the restroom, the fiend creeped up behind Orton 15 years later
The roles are changing now  Heel Drew  Face randy
ight i could see WWE becoming really good again.
Ortan choosing Drew over the fiend was so good
Thanos "Where is the stone?" Randy Orton   "Where is the fiend?"
I want a triple threat match at survivor series for the wwe championship
i love drew so mucg
Randy Orton isn't a coward but he's also not stupid choosing between The Fiend or Drew the choice is easy
When is WWE gonna get rid of edited boos and cheers? Almost feels like a WWE2K Story.
This is awesome!!
Wait a second is drew going to be a part of the fiend family
Good. Now we got triple threat for WWE champion at suvivor series. The fiend Will win it again
Orton vs Fiend vs McIntyre
Bliss is $$$$$$$$$$$$$$
*PSYCHO ALEXA BLISS IS HOT AS HELL WHEN SHE IS LAUGHING  HYSTERICALLY*
Easter egg!!!:  alexa bliss’s like, overalls, says “yowie owie” but the yowie, if you look at the dot on the yowie, it shows a x on the o, that means that the staff that bray used to kill the rabbit, was there. In the firefly funhouse.
The videotitle gives me the impression that Drew and Bray planned that together. I mean it kinda sounds like that. Like Drew talked to Bray and Alexa and asked if they want to mess Randy up.
Hot
This is getting boring
Imagine how destructive a fiend + drew tag team could be
Orton should've slammed the fiends face with his newly one wwe championship and then some
OMG 0:36 had me cryinggg because Bliss face - I , OMG ITS JUST TOO FUNNY I CANT EVEN EXPLAIN. Like she was being creepy but funny at the same time UGHHHHHHHH😤😤😤
WHO'S LOVE WWE????
croud chanting is so fake lol
How did the fiend and drew make a trap for randy Orton if the fiend was just standing there doing nothing

The fiend must be champ, give him his fav. Toy
Bliss = Harley Quinn
Lol drew salty
Burned down 😅😅 run raddy
Is it just me or did Randy Orton looked like he was tad bit scared???
Stable Alexa, The Fiend, Orton Strowman, Jeff, Bo Dallas.  Or  Alexa, The Fiend, McIntyre, Strowman.
Alexa is Beautiful, Super Sexy, Super Cute, Super Hot, Super Gorgeous. The Fiend a Lucky Man Ryan Cabrera a Lucky Man.
Notice at the beginning when alexa said Randy and Drew “burned the house down”. Just like how in 2017 randy burned bray wyatts cabin
I'm thinking of a triple threat match between Drew , Randy and the Fiend
Randy need to go to aew
What if Drew turns heal
Honestly, the EX-WWE Champion Doesn't need the help of Bray Wyatt to give Randy a message, he can do it himself!  But vince being Mr. McMahon always, i just hope he don't make Drew join the fiend, just like he did to Bliss, Drew can catch that title again by himself!
alexa the new harley quinn?? n fiend the joker???....and dont understand why the are building the fiend..only to build up one of the best characters in recent history to only get squashed by frigging goldberg. makes no sense.
Was this a "heel turn" by Drew McIntyre?
Hope Alexa gets a mask similar to the scary masks she had in that one WWE ad.
Haven’t watch wwe in ages why tf is harley quinn in it
It should be drew McIntyre vs Randy Orton vs The Fiend triple threat match for the tittle in Survival series WWE
NGL, it's weird seeing Drew without the belt. I honestly wish this feud with Randy would end so they can have Drew move on to some other things, before eventually coming back into the main title picture next year when, hopefully, the crowds are back.
Is the crowd in a zoom call? LMAOO
Did Drew just poke Randy's eye out with a pen ?
Orton got alot on his plate..Drew still at him..The Fiend never forgot and on his tail....The Miz can cash in on him anytime and he got to deal with Roman at Survivor Series
Drew McIntyre is going get a rematch against randy orton again for wwe championship at Survival series
I think they should just the fiend vs Randy Orton in a non title match because Randy just won the tittle so that bray wyatt could get his revenge what Orton did to him when he burn down his home
Ya este show de lucha de la WWE da es verguenza. Ya no tienen creatividad.
Looked like The Fiend controlled Randy. Roman vs Orton Survivor Series and The Fiend crashes the party and the match ends with The Fiend on top on both champs. The Fiend has history with both The FIend and Roman. Would be fun though.
Why now is Randy the champion you know they could have made Randy the champion at summerslam and clash of champions they didn’t why now
So what was the point of the fiend coming out makes no sense
I could see the fiend maybe helping Drew win the title back but I’m not sure on that.
The fiend needs to have more matches all he have are segments
That match was insane drew McIntyre VS randy Orton at hell in a cell
Orton shouldn't have won the title. His time has come and gone. McIntyre deserves to be champion for a long long time
Look at how cute her fit is!!!!
Idk about y’all, but Alexa is fine asf....
Dude we need a triple threat match between those 3
Orton is such a good champ
Alexa Bliss is peng but Sasha Banks is straight 🔥
Count on Vince to Screw everything up as usually 🥱
I reaaally miss the crowd
she looks like lana Rhodes
Drew is trying to kill randy
The fiend is good acting
How this whole segment went down was perfect.  Orton knew this was probably a trap. Orton knew the Fiend was around. When he was on the stage he knew who was behind him.  Orton had to truly pick his poison. Fiend or McIntyre.
Check me out, or not. Either way, stay VIBIN' 🦒
East and west Randy is the best
Everyone is talking about how well Alexa Bliss plays the character of the female Fiend, but Randy was amazing in this, not even looking over his shoulder and brawled  with McIntyre instead showing how scared he really is.
I Thot drew and Rendy was friands😞😞
Imagine edge comes to help randy
😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲
Alexa for Harley Quinn
Yessss sirrr ☺something tells me this is the beginning of a very entertaining story 🔥🤘
🎧🎵🎵👍👍👍👹😭😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🥳🤣🤣🤣 WWE RAW
Wcddd
➡لا اله الا الله محمد رسول الله⏰⏳🌠
FAKE
alexa bliss is so cute on her new persona
Maybe Alexa Bliss or Sister Abigail wants Randy Orton to be punished for buring down the Wyatt family compound a few years ago.
It's almost as if Alexa Bliss' laughing signaled that she wanted Randy Orton to get beaten down by Drew Mycintyre, punished even.
Oooooooo
2:14
at 2:27 you can see when Randy orton knew he was in trouble
Sbsbsi
This segment showed a rare example of WWE exercising long term storyline continuity. The Fiend actually remembered how Orton burned his house down and used the chance to embarrass him.
So Drew’s injury is magically gone that quick ? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
First they teased a FIEND vs ROMAN feud then they screwed that up by putting WYATT on RAW. Now they are teasing a FIEND, Orton, McIntyre feud. Let's hope they don't mess this up.
So the fiend just got to leave
Finally The Fiend and Orton, the story is there, the feud writes itself
Oh I can see this being a triple threat match
The quick alternations between camera shots makes me nauseous. Thats one of the main reason I don't watch wwe no more.
Alexa bliss💓💓💓
Feind wwe champion 2020
If I were the fiend, I'd think to myself "are you kidding me? I'm a supernatural kinda human being and you only worry about drew?" In that moment when the fiend stood behind randy it felt more like a short comedy scene then a honest title scene.
U know how Bliss acting like that laugh pointing reminds me of from suicide squad joker's girlfriend
wwe FINALLY is getting something right. They keep this up, I may start watching full time again.
Need need need Alexa Bliss Fiend two pack.
Alexa plays that character well but the crazy Scott nikki cross would of made a perfect sister Abigail
Mhm this is good i might start watching wwe again
Why the sounds so fake like you got the money to make it sound at least a little better
I think WWE is set for the rest of the year through their storylines
alexa is so freaking cute
Man i love alexas character
This is the wwe we love to see
I feel the Mr F is gonna heal Randal
Please at some point let Mcintyre claymore bliss
Ok. How did Randy Ortan get up from that first beating he got from Drew MacIntyre that quickly when everything went black?
I wonder how this is going to go
Why did McIntyre lose the title? Pissed me off.
Nice fake audience roar.
She be 30 and dressing like that. I want one.
The fiend and bray Wyatt character kinda reminds me of dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
don't get me wrong I live Drew - not more then Orton but I like him nonetheless - but this makes no sensw...   Orton was jumped by 4 or 5 people during the last title fight so I can understand why he came back pissed, but Drew lost fair and square but he's out here acting like some outside entity was the reason for it...
B tec harley quinn
Me go and watch raw on monday sees 254k views on a video of the fiend, me come back the next day sees 1m views of the fiend video.
2020 has been the best year in wrestling.
Lmfao no clue whats going on.... Whos on what side ?no matter AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW !!!!
So sad to see the sexy alexa bliss stand in the shadow of  the fiend wwe is losing its grip on wrestling lol ... But remember to tune into tnt for Aew the best wrestling show now always and forever
I stopped watching WWE when Punk left but I thought Bray Wyatt was the best character on the roster... then he was ruined. PLEASE DON'T MESS UP THE FIEND... also give Punk all the money and put him in a storyline with Fiend = money.
That moment where Randy knew The Fiend is behind and Drew is forward in the ring. The moment he walked with an expression of helplessness towards Drew knowing what The Fiend is capable of is excellent story telling.
That moment where Randy knows he will die but he chose the painless way to die i.e. by facing Drew was such good story telling
Alexa is The gil joker ?
The fiend is a revenge tour. Guess he didn't forget randy burn the house down.
That was a good choice by Randy
I like Alexa bliss attitude.
Mmmnnnmnnnnnnnjjnnnjnnnjjjjj
Alexa is so cuuuuuuute 😍😍😍
Randy Orton has to be the best heel in WWE history (besides Triple H)
Good drama
The Fiend: *shows up  *McIntyre and Orton continues fighting  The Fiend: Hey what about me
Imagine The Fiend and Alexa Bliss somehow forming an alliance with Drew McIntyre to destroy Randy Orton.
This era of WWE remind me of those afull years in the TNA Hogans era
اعود عند درو ماكنتاير أهون لي 😅
Best for business would be Drew vs Randy vs Fiend with Drew become the 2nd time Champ but lost immediately because of Miz’s cash in,after the ppv would be Drew still running at the top card for the Wwe champ when feuding with Miz,while Randy and Fiend would have chance to continue the great story telling feud since 2014.God damn what a way to end 2020
Why are we ignoring the fact that edge is not over with orton? Which means Orton is surrounded by 4 enemies at once: Roman,Drew,Edge,Bray
Love this storyline amazing
triple match wwe championship......
For a moment I thought the fiend possessed Mcintyre
That make me remember When randy join the wayyt family
The fiend is like the joker and alexa bliss is the harley quinn hahahahaah
I love lexi kaufman aka alexa bliss may love....
Why does the ending still have legendary
Alexa Bliss looks like a Dollar Tree Harley Quinn
Heres the thimg randy right he has problmems with bray in the past if they have a match sure i want randy to retain but i dont the feind to lose because it would destroy his momentum
I really wise bliss was a better actor.
Orten 💪💜💚
Trash as usual.
Alexa bliss = Harley Quinn
that's scary So scary
هههههههههه
Yo! They can’t be having my boy RKO trapped like that. Randy knows the fiend’s around now, time for the mind games.
Alexa is like making tiktok joker
🤷🏿‍♂️ I wish Alexa Bliss would let me in 🤷🏿‍♂️
Okay Alexa Bliss...Randy Orton isn't afraid to RKO women. Just ask Beth Phoenix.
How has Randy’s character become so weak?
Bro she’s like Harley Quinn and I’m loving it
McIntyre is overrated
Congratulations randy Orton you are the best in the business.
2:21 RANDY - HES RIGHT BEHIND ME ISNT HE
She is like harly Queen bruh
Drew McIntyre one love
Dreew vs Randy vs the fiend..😈💪💪💪 survivor siries
Wwe is like a damn soap opera now what the hell lol
لخبهتلننرم😎😂
Those crowd noises need to chill
I was really hoping that the Claymore will end the rivalry at HIAC. But it just got reversed. But a new feud between the fiend and randy will refreshes the Good old wyat family.
WWE is boring now
🤣😲🤣😈
Randy congratulations i cnt stop laughing the way u left the fiend stand by u new he is behind you so u chose to go toward drew da was the best move ever✌💥
All those easter eggs in the firefly fun house is coming together in the most beautiful way! It was about time they put The Fiend to hunt down Randy Orton for the Burned house with the sister Abigail rocking chair inside! Its been a while since I’ve said this... Good Job WWE
Awesome Storyline 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
What a gorgeous girl 😍😍 So Beautiful and so cute Alexa Bliss 😍😍
I just have one question. How long do you think it will take before wrestling fans loose interest in the fiend???
Smart guy Orton
She's a very very good looking woman
lol drew irate as if orton cheated or something to dethrone him.
Randy vs fiend vs drew Who is best?
I can't believe she was laughing
Alexa is the cutest.
Drew mcintyre vs Fiend Bray wyatt yes super super
Miracle Drew didnt just feed him to the fiend
I wanna see the fiend try to disrupt the Mad Tribal Chief Roman Reigns. With no fear in Roman reigns eyes he  grabs the fiend by the neck and says, “no one not even you will be in the way of my quest to be Tribal Chief”. The fiend for the first time is scared, lights turn off and he disappears. That would be the most badass scene in wwe 2020.
drew McIntyre will take wwe champion
vs drew McIntyre
Randy Orton Will lose the wwe champion
Прошу верните рестлинг 90 годов
Uh no lookout behind u it's the fiend
four incredibly talented workers here. all time potential storyline
Is the fiend still Face or Heel?
B
Joker and Harley Quinn
I love Alexa bliss 💖
I tffiphho
The other thing that hurt's this segment is the fan's being there on tv screens and having fake crowd noices.
The viper 💪
Only way i can get behind bray wyatt and the wwe title is this bring back the fan's if there still is any to have there who have any energy left 2nd have the wwe champion get attacked by one or many people then have miz cash in win and then he is attacked by bray wyatt and drew mcintyre.
So was the fiend helping Drew? Cuz Drew was about to Claymore Kick Randy until the light goes off. So technically The Fiend saved Randy from getting his head kick off.
Santa: "When I woke up this morning, I felt like going out and getting a job."Banta: "Did you?"Santa: "No. I stayed in bed until the feeling passed."
I know only brainy people an answer this. . . . What do you get when you cross Santa Claus and a duck?
"Burned the House Down"  What a good call-back lol
Ugh they're using that camera zoom again?
Honestly without the Undertaker, there hasn't been a specter or a phenom type villain for a while.  Im really glad that the genre is coming back and it isnt comical or dumb, Bray Wyatt is killing it
Hahahahaaa this the WWE now.
May be in the minority when I say this, but I honestly feel like the live shows have been a lot better without actual fans live in attendance. Sure the knowledge of the piped-in audience reactions may annoy some, but honestly a good majority of fans tend to either unnecessarily  hijack shows or just be dead silent during big moments. I'm loving this run that WWE is currently having.
I thibk drew gonna lose again
Drew a sore loser 😂
Randy Orton Deserves The Title
I'm hoping for a Triple Threat match for the WWE Champioship
Why the fiend bray wyatt is no attaking the undertaker
Boring I'm falling asleep he's not 😨 😴💤💤💤💤 😂🤣
Orton vs mcintyre vs the fiend Will be nice match
She should be a nice Harley Quinn
Orton as champion is what's best for business
Drew McIntyre love pens lol 🤣
I loved Bray vs Orton. Cant wait to see Fiend vs Orton
Wtf has happened to the wwe. My god it’s unrecognisable.... absolutely dead...
They are like joker and harley quinn of wwe
I didn't understand the fiend getting drafted to raw, I was then infuriated more when he crossed paths with retribution. Now i get it.
triple threat TLC match at TLC between Orton , McIntyre and Wyatt
Is the feiend bray Wyatt?!
Is it just me or did Alexas outfit look like a outfit a mother would put her toddler in
WTF
Alexa is sister abigail,the reference Randy and drew burned the house down came from when Randy burned the wyatt compound to the ground.when he was feuding with bray
Alexa is so damn cute😂
Tuve eo"
THIIIIIIIIIGH SLAP
Orton is the LEGEND KILLER
2:58 Ready [  ]
She looks like Harley queen
Alexa Bliss sitting on the turnbuckle laughing made this scene
Did Drew try to be John Wick and use a pen on Randy
Why do they got Harley Quinn on wwe?
Lol what a joke. So many people have the potential to be the Champion but they keep choosing old people. Orton again
This is the only reason I watch wrestling.
Alexa is on this roll 100%> she is just awesome
She could totally play harley Quinn
Bray is a rip-off he bores me
asuka is boring alexa is better
alexa is just the bestttttttttt
Alexa is so cute
is that a new tat on randy?
Watched a video of Nikki cross captured by bliss and the fiend, to join them, wouldnt mind seeing that happening
Dude let's be honest randy will destroy the fiend
They better not screw up the fiend character
wwe has their NEW KANE, but WEIRDER in "The Fiend"
That’s probably gonna a triple threat match I can feel that might Be as hint for what’s going to happen later
2.24  If they can make the tongue stick out more it would make Fiend even scarier
😂😂😂😂 am happy for randy but we need our tidal back
I'm a super huge wrestling fan. And I knew about their past. But the whole Orton vs The Fiend idea completely went over my head but it makes so much sense with their history and besides the Fiend.. even waaaaay back.. Orton was kinda one of the darkest wrestlers so this feud makes sense and I feel Orton is one of the few believable opponents to go against the Fiend. The Fiend is my fav wrestler in the company and Orton has always been one of my fav heels. I'm stoked on this. And I'm happy for Bliss. She has stated that she is stoked on this storyline. Everything is going great so far 😜👍
love alexa looks
Harley quinn of wwe
Bliss giving off the very wrong fetishes right here.
Why is Mcintyre angry? He lost clean.
Randy Orton had no choice Drew or The Fiend.
No que pasa orton como asi no se necesita d mucha fuerza para vencer. Aun rival con misma fuerza de el mismo celo vence que randy orton
If we had a crowd wwe would be the best in years
Yup i Remember When Randy Orton Burn Bray Wyatt House Down Back In February 2017 @ 0:20 🤣🤣🤔🤔
Alexa is so damn beautiful wow
Hello everyone 👋 Are you interested in earning consistent income weekly via binary options trade??
I like drew buy bruh they making him annoying now. He’s the only one I’ve seen this mad after losing to someone like wwe please stop this
wwe in the last 4 months have been just incredible everything in the wwe is just fun again like before the storylines the talent that wwe has the hurt business, retribution, randy Orton, drew, the fiend the new day, aj styles, matt riddle, Ellies, Jeff hardy, big E, sheamus, the entire women division on both raw and smack down. bayley , Sasha banks. its just incredible wwe is at its best everything they are doing is so much fun to watch , roman regens, and the usos i am so happy that wwe is finally back to how it should be it's back to the old Era that we all loved but in a new way I can't imagine how much more entertaining wwe will be when the fans are physically back like before and we see 20 or 25 thousand people in the stadium
The chicken snake tried to run when it went black. The Fiend put a stop to Orton's running. It was WONDERFUL seeing DREW beat him down, can't wait too see the Fiend get ahold of the chicken snake.
Absolutely love Alexa in this character!! Her & The Fiend are GREAT!!!
Fiend face turn?
Imagine a match with the Fiend vs Willow(Jeff hardy)
Alexa bliss is so pretty.. Very beautiful
Bliss getting rkoed sooner or later
When drew McIntyre comes randy Orton like: im outta here  When the fiend comes: im staying
He couldn’t turn back so that he won’t turn into a pillar I’d salt
those edited crowd noises are really annoying
Where Stone cold steve Austin ?
Randy😍😍😍 How hot Alexa ?😍
Yo Undertaker back when he was the ministry of darkness now that one was cool but scary at the same time now bray wyatt you just don't scare me just a guy wearing a mask
I'm sure the feud will be great but why does WWE always put Bray in these situations to fail. We all know Randy's not dropping the strap anytime soon and even if he does it's going to be to Edge. They did this with him last year with Seth Rollins, and they almost did it with Roman Reigns earlier this year. Can you at least build him before you tear him down(Again).
Yo The Fiend don't scare me at all he just bray wyatt in a stupid suit
Are we all gonna ignore that Alexa looks freaking adorable?
Awesome, @kelvin.lemo  hepled me gain back my disabled account in a matter of seconds. Find him on Instagram to get this incredible service and lots more.....💯💯💯
the horror movie begin....
Drew Mcintyre beat the break's off of Randy Orton while Alexa start laughing her head off
This is a good story line don’t ruin it
Honestly, Orton ended and stole Wyatt his WWE title that just had for like a month. The Fiend needs, deserves, and must win the title from Orton and earn his payback. Sorry for Drew; I wish he didn't lose his title, but I don't really picture a Fiend vs Drew right now
Why does Randy want the fiend?
I hate how they are making Orton seem weak as if he cant fight.
Randy Orton: I know Bray Wyatt better than anybody.  Harper, Rowan, and Strowman: Well yes, but actually no.
When he said where is The Fiend he sounded like Batman
The belt looks better on Drew McIntyre
Nobody saw on usa network but mcintyre stabbed randy orton with a,pen
Triple Threat  Then The Miz will cash in MITB All of Orion past rivals returning back
Thumbnail 🔥👀
Jesus the camera cuts... how is anyone supposed to watch this?
I pray they don't ruin this fiend bliss story and hope drew doesn't drop down the card
*So The Fiend as an associate of McIntyre?*
Harley Quinn wannabe
Organ don’t Diserve this championship
Randy orton 🔥
Wwe2k22
Idc what all you simps might say, Alexa makes me CRINGE
As predictable as WWE is, this is going to end in a triple threat isn't it?
Orton fearless
Love Randy orton, but please WWE it would be sooooo amazing to have "The Fiend and Alexa Bliss" AS CHAMPION!! That would be siiiiick!! Wooo do it do it
Alexa said Randy Orton “burned the house down” that reminds me of when Orton burned down the Wyatt family compound
likeeeee
Ive had problems with the wwe storyline before...but the writers got it right this time....y'all winning on raw and smackdown right now
Drew: I want my title rematch!! Fiend: I want my title rematch from 3 years ago!! Orton: I miss Edge
WWE 2020 is Awesome
hi
I LOVE the Storyline
Randy Randy Randy there is no more running there is no more hiding he was stuck in the middle between Drew McIntyre and the friend ne know who are you going to pick the fight is to question you talk a big talk lets if you can back it up and fight your way out of this you are way on your own bye bye
Why y'all got Mcintyre actin like a sore loser🤔
*Insert Big E eating popcorn 🍿 GIF here* 🙌🏻
Dear Vince McMahon, out of all things you can ruin, just please, don't ruin this one. This is the best storyline you got on RAW so DON'T RUIN IT.  Sincerely, EVERY WWE FAN (Who's interested in this feud to say the least)
I knew the fiend would come to Randy because he actually burned the Wyatt family compound.
Let randy regin! Dem new comers not ready
If Alexa is Sister Abigail then she is seeking revenge on her shed being burned down by Randy Orton and the fiend is coming for revenge.
Alexa is like a young Sheri Moon Zombie
Alexa Bliss has always been talented not just the now
Ok so ilk finally ask the question. Dome vs Live crowd....
Smartest thing sending Bray to Raw. Now Raw has Bray and Alexa making it so much better and Smackdown has Roman and the tribal Cheif story making it brilliant
Alexa is short
I’m glad I seen the end with Drew poking Randy Orton in the eye with the pen last night the show just cut off with Drew never getting payback
Randy made raw great again
Hey Randy how does feel to be brutalize am I right
Randy orton is dead
The feind needs to put randy down
U can tell the fiend was coming because alexa voice isnt the same as usual she has a different tone i would have took off
😆😆👍👍👍👍👍👍👀👀👀🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭 🤝 you will listen to me now I knew it I said😔😔😔😔 the stor💯💯💯💯y still continue🤫🤫🤫🤫
lol why she act like harley queen
They should give the women's championship to bliss when Bray wins the wwe championship
Randy will probably turn out more aggressive after the fiend defeats him
I like how there are keeping the Fiend as a monster. Alexa's acting was perfect. Randy Orton choosing between The Fiend and Drew.
This is such a ruthless aggression like storyline and I love it. Drew and The Fiend working together (sort of) to mess with Orton sounds like it shouldn't work but clearly it does. Orton burned down the compound ages ago and it's finally being brought up again, I love this long term storytelling. I've been a smackdown mark since I was a kid but now I'm more about Raw since Jey uso just can't convince me with his storyline. Roman vs Orton will be great.
Wendy's past is hunting him....new champion in a few The Fiend
It's freakin  awesome 🤘🤘
Orton: he's behind me? Ok, I choose Mcintyre
Randy Orton deserves everything he gets for all these years being a first class JERK
Bray is the fiend,but randy is the legend killer
I think a part of Bray is still in Orton's head. Why would he go after Drew instead of trying to dip out? My theory is that Fiend possessed him at that moment, making him walk towards Drew..
He remembers...... It was Randy who started Bray's transformation to the Fiend then Matt Hardy finished the transformation.
I am getting amazing Harley Quinn vibes and I love it. She is very very good at this role
You’ve just got to give it to the creativity of the story writers of wwe
Alexa so freaking sexy!!
She remembers me like avril 😂😂😂
Randy better give drew a match
This is the best storyline on Raw right now.
Randy has the ability to go damn dark, darker than people may be able to handle, Fiend better watch out. The mistake Fiend makes is he thinks hes the biggest nightmare around.
Fans: finally good storyline Wwe writers: where is my eraser to change the script
Raw is so bad The fiend and Alexa should have stayed on smackdown and now my concern is that stupid people will say it's their fault of how bad the show is, which obviously is not their fault.
who else thought alexa bliss was about to say "burn it down"?
Credit where credit is due... WWE is killing it lately. Fiend and Bliss = 🔥. Randy/Drew feud = 🔥. Tribal Chief storyline = 🔥. NXT as a whole = 🔥. Not sure what creative changes were made lately, but they've made me a regular viewer again. Well played, WWE.
Sexy Bliss  Beautiful Bliss
1:16 phew, glad that's over
Alexa really fits this new role. Loving it
Kofi Kingston won the wwe title at wrestlemania 35  2019 held the title to 2019 season premiere of smackdown Brock Lesnar won the title at season premiere of smackdown 2019 held the title to wrestlemania 36 2020 drew McIntyre won the title at wrestle mania 36 2020 held the title to hell in a cell and lose to Randy orton maybe randy orton held the wwe champion to wrestle mania 37 2021 or money inthe bank
I do not now why they lie ot kids this is ik fake
Triple threat is what I’m guessing will happen
Orton Vs reigns at survivor series is definitely going to end with the fiend destroying both reigns and Orton
Think Orton should ask AJ if he can borrow his body guard with all the enemies he's got
I was high and got CREEPED TF out when I heard her say Burn the House down also if u look at Alexa laughing its like how bray(fiend) laughs maybe the fiend has control
The fiend be venting like an impostor he sus lol
This is kind of like 007 Skyfall, Randy is M and the Fiend is Silva... The Fiend behind Randy is like Silva hacking into M computer with the words "Think of your sins."
Alexa Bliss is too good!!
Randy orton vs the fiend MY DREAM MATCH
I miss the old bliss
Everyone was really doubting this storyline but I actually think it’s a good storyline in a LONGGGGGGGG TIME 👍
I think there’s Gonna be a triple threat match
Imo I'd say after Survivor Series they should either have a triple threat Orton vs Fiend vs McIntyre or have fiend vs McIntyre for the number #1 contender spot
WHAT THE HELL DID THE CHAIR EVER DO TO YOU MCINTYRE!?! 1:17 😒🤣
Randy orton deserves whats coming to him. Dennis Winship lynn,massachusetts
Bellissima, Sexy, Hot, Fantastica, Meravigliosa.
Alexa vs Asuka for Raw Women's Championship.
Alexa is Awesome.
I know one day my comment will get lost in the comment section  but if someone sees this,    Have a nice life.
I thought it was a Brazzers segment 🤣🤣
Triple threat?
TLC Randy vs drew vs the fiend and then the miz cash it the Money in the bank
The Fiend and drew McIntyre looks great as a tag team
Damn the Fiend is boring
I want to see Drew be champion again I miss hearing please welcome the WWE Champion Drew McIntyre
It's gonna suck when we don't have our current legends anymore. Randy Orton is one of them. 💯
Did anyone see Orton just get stabbed by the pen or is it just me lol
No more COLE saying..... Whoaa twistedd blissss"
Alexa😍😻
Dre mcintyre no merecé ser campeón nunca en la vida 😡
So does this mean Randy is the face and Drew the heel now?
Kann jemand deutsch
From alexa bliss to harley quinn
Fiend vs orton? i hope orton retains
hold up wait minute burn the house down I’m pretty sure Seth did that all ready
orton the best
Triple threat?? As long as Drew doesn't win :/
1:58 my entire life changed with the help of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
ABOUT TIME ORTON WAS CHAMPION AND WAS THE MAIN EVENT HE WOULD BE BRILLIANT IN AEW
Alexa bliss reminds me of Harley Quinn
how about some more tattoos orton? that will really make you stand out from the crowd. not.
She's practically Harley Quinn.
Randy Orton is one of the last superstars I would of expected to see On A Moment Of Bliss
I heard that Joseph Park had his touches on this story, is that true????
I love randy I whith I could meet randy I am so happy for him but I felll bad the they put thumps down like why don’t you like him☹️
Alexa Bliss is just too adorable like that!
Drew McIntyre: “sorry” 😂
👍👍👍🌹🌹🌹
Imagine the fiend and Drew McIntyre team Up Aginst Randy Orton and tucker
Anyone else start rubbing their hands together the minute they just realized that the Fiend, the Legend Killer, and the Psychopath are literally standing in the same room together?
We all know randy is the best.
Randy Orton is the best as Champion!!!!
They wasted bliss. They could put her on survivor Series as a psycho character or something.
I think this has the potential for a great storyline. Triple threat at Survivor Series. The fiend, Orton, and McIntyre. The Fiend doesn’t truly need a belt, but he needs a meaningful storyline. At survivor series, Drew McIntyre pins Orton to win back his belt, after the Fiend is taken out by the Undertaker. Reports are he hasn’t retired. A proper send off to the Deadman would be a match with the Fiend at Wrestlemania, passing the torch and losing in a war (possibly a buried alive match). Have the Fiend vs McIntyre at the Royal Rumble, where the Undertaker once again interferes, costing the fiend (not a DQ, Drew still deserves the pin, but after the lights go out and the Undertaker shows up ringside to distract the Fiend). McIntyre carries the belt into Mania to face whatever dream scenario everyone has and The Fiend gets a strong win against the Deadman, properly passing the torch and giving him his send off, and elevating the Fiend even higher (also somewhat instilling credibility in Wyatts mania record since he’s taken too many losses there). Long term booking may be a dream, but it would certainly pay off.
Just came here to say ALEXA BLISS is freaking awesome
Has the fiend himself ever fought Roman Reigns? I know it’s bray Wyatt but like how about the fiend vs Roman reigns
Yo randy i one of favorites
Al Alexa stop this please
2:28 same moment for fiend vs john cena
This was funny especially when Alexia bliss said when you and Drew McIntyre burned the house down. And Drew McIntyre said surprise
The fiend is absolutely the interesting thing in wwe right now...!!!
This should be in Trending!! YouTube is screwing wwe over
Im ready for the fiend to take the wwe title back
What if Drew McIntyre joins the Firefly Fun House?
We all mad here lol
alexa bliss drama and character was on point
to quote The Joker: "And here......we.......go"  let the feud of Randy and Bray begin....this should be an amazing feud
Love the sadistic laugh by bliss
Tales from the crypt in the WWE the fiend Bray Wyatt
Drew was the most boring champion ever, just stop the storyline with Randy and make the Fiend have a title shot
I would like to see, Orton vs McInryre vs Fiend for the title, inside the steel cage
She laughing at drew and randy fighting
I don’t blame you randy i would’ve never looked back neither 🤣
I wonder what Nikki Cross and Nia Jax think of Alexa right now
OMG! Going to love this storyline !! 😈😈🔥🔥
No one can do this to me it is not like I punt kicked Drew before attacked Drew before oh wait yes I have
Drew= the most badass babyface since sheamus
When Alexa said Burn the house down I thought about when Seth burned down the firefly fun house down
I was hoping Fiend would attack Drew as well
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
If it ain't a triple threat match between Drew, Rko and Fiend, I'm not watching.
Low key thought miz was gonna cash in
Y’all notice that drew got a pin an he stabbed Randy in the eye
I feel like randy is the face of this rivalry but at the same time I could be wrong
I understand randy here honestly bro if you had a choice would you rather the fiend or drew McIntyre
Woah
To the people who think it makes no sense that Drew ignored the Fiend, both men haven't wronged each other and Orton wronged both so they have a common enemy.
Bray Wyatt = Money Bray Wyatt = Ratings keep pushing Bray Wyatt WWE
OMG Long-term storytelling. See how much more effective it is than just throwing whatever sticks on the wall?
The Moment of Bliss this is version of Alexa Bliss was terrified and i love her with The Fiend and i love see this is match for The WWE Championship Randy Orton vs Drew McIntyre vs The Fiend Bray Wyatt this my Dream match ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
RKO
Sand full video all
A Randy Orton le dio miedo
Triple Threat Match, Orton Wins, and Bray and Drew begin feud. My prediction.
*burned the house down...*
You're swelling Drew more than he deserves, Randy's better than him😒🐍
Oooh Alexa what a beautiful sexy smile 😍😂❤️❤️
Alexa Bliss laughing and being twisted is very hot. I love her new look.
Drew mcintyre just leave randy orton alone man
The Fiend Creeping behind Randy Orton back reminds me of when The Undertaker was stalking Randy Orton in the restroom 15 years ago on Smackdown. right
Now she's always laughing like me
0:54 alexa really dress like Chuckie 2:22 behind you randy
Plz abonne
One of the best storylines of the decade!!
The Fiend should offer Randy Orton up to Alexa "Twisted" Bliss, Sister Abigail
so Orton chose the lesser of two evils, good call as he knows what the fiend is capable of
Dear WWE, please give a raise to whoever came up with this storyline
alexa bliss and orton 2 favorites yeeahh, true wwe and true womens champions, beauty and rko
Classic wwe blowing their load early on the fiend 😅
is the fiend a face turn now
I feel like fiend is way better improve mask wrestler i seen for while besides rey like but to be frfr i feel like This Character is not going to stick around like  Godfather with Papa  Cody Rhodes with stardust Bray wyatt as sister abigl Character like this wwe Doesn't get alot fame or stick around as permenty like kane or demon king
Follow. the Buzzards!
The Fiend : I am gonna ruin and scar this guy's entire life The Undertaker : ha the memories
Is nobody going to mention that Drew shoved a pen into Randy's eye 🤣 I get that this fiend storyline is going to (hopefully) be amazing but how did nobody notice?
Bray going from Mr. Steal your Girl” to Mr. World Champion” real quick.
The belt looks good on him but drew still needs it
So, Alexa Bliss is just perfect at everything? No surprise there.
Thunderdome reignited WWE
Put a like if yuor favourite wwe superstar is Bruan strowman Brock lesnar might deafeat bruan but Brock will always get this hands
IDK maybe this is hinting to drew joining the firefly house and it's so dumb Randy win the title how many times did Randy yet title shots
You deserved having that pen in your eye Randy you pissed Drew off
Oh no
Orton, McIntrye, Bray, Bliss, Gold.
Look at this baby
Why don't Drew Mclntyre go fight with Roman... It is boring to see this storyline continues... very boring.
So is orton baby face or what?
I think Braun strowman should have a demon
Alexa:Y’all burned the house down and you will pay for what you did...                       Randy:SHUT UR DAM MOUTH ILL TAKE FIEND OUT WITH AN R K O!                          Fiend:*appears* LET ME IN RANDY *Attacks*.                                               Drew:Old Wyatt family:/
I wanted Randy to just RKO Alexa when she was laughing it woulda been so funny
What happened to Orton when bliss said burn the house down hmm tales me back to2017
Man, I told you. This is my main man Drew McIntyre in the ring. He's going to crash A Moment of Bliss and why the big deal is Alexa Bliss wearing sexy halloween dress name Chucky doll again
NOT THE CHAIRSSS!!!!!
Fiend
In my fantasy world no one can beat me I hate losing matches I can’t lose no way I can lose I am Randy there is no way you can beat me oh wait there is a way because Drew won twice Randy one at summerslam and then the other at Clash so you are the definition of a loser
Now randy have targets on his back now?
Bliss is watching McIntyre beat up Orton like a kindergardener watching their dad beat up their bully
You brought this all to yourself Randy orton very scary Randy is a very scary person oh wait no he is not what he is is the definition of a loser lost twice and then won the third time the definition of a loser in my book
Alexa is popping off
This story line remind me of the rock and triple H 🤣🤣🤣🤣🇬🇧🌎🌎🌎
Im loving how this is unfolding, having not only the fiend not attack, but for Orton to walk away from him. I don't see it as an act of cowardess at all. I see it as picking his battles, finish one before starting another because he knows he's not done with Drew just yet.
Hear me out, drew mcintyre and the fiend become a tag team, then the fiend turns on him after drew wins a rematch against randy orton, it would be a perfect storyline
ì love the fiend and i want willow
The Fiend should take McIntyre Championship not Orton, the creatives of WWE ARE STUPID IDIOTS
I thought randy was traded to smackdown im confused
I kinda feel sorry for Randy imagine two dangerous wrestler targeting you
A triple threat match for the title would be awesome!!!
Hulk Hogan would beat both of them at the same time. Hulkamania!!!
They shoulda booked Orton vs fiend for the title at Survivor series but its a pointless match with reigns instead maybe Royal Rumble 2021
How does Mcintyres hair stay like that all night? Looks like he has a mullet
Pleseeeeeeeee The Fiend next Champion
But let’s be honest.Everybody knows that the Fiend is no match for Roman Reigns.
S'abonner plan 1000 saboner
Finally wwe did something right
What I loved most about the segment was that there was no needless exposition explaining why randy was tipped of by "burned the house down", even if on its own it's a commonly used expression for doing something really well.
This is totally freaking awesome run Randy run
Man the Alexa Bliss/Bray Wyatt and Reigns/Usos stuff is some of the best stuff in a long time in WWE.
After this segment I'm sure Randy RKO'd Bliss somewhere on a bed. She was staring the viper up and down that segment lol.
Randy genre savy: "If I turn around into someone appearing behind me they hit their finisher... I'll just walk away slowly."
Not gonna lie I've been waiting for this storyline
Alexa as Harley Quinn is so hot.
The Fiend vs Randy vs Drew vs ......... The Miz
I see a triple threat in the future 👀
Aj Lee would been better
Oooooooo randy vs the feind at crown jewel would be sooooo wholesome
Alexa can burn my house down now!!😍😍😍
OMG ITS A RECYCLED STORY LINE OF RANDY ORTON AND BRAY WYATH!???
I absolutely love this Orton vs Fiend but why is McIntyre involved?
Fiend vs McIntyre vs Orton   Book it vince DO IT...
Hopefully we get a mixed tag match with The Fiend & Alexa Bliss soon
It was creepy when he stuck his tongue out a little lmao
Alexa is so great in this role.
THE FIEND LOOKS LIKE THE NEW VERSION OF THE UNDERTAKER
wwe is dying off
It's Orton that is the most popular WWE Guy in the Wwe universe
My prediction this where RETRIBUTION comes into play orton  side with them to take care of the Fiend. I dont think  RETRIBUTION done with the Fiend nor the The Hurt  business.
Spooky scary skeleten
Bray Wyatt so a genius
The prettiest version of Alexa, let her in
So Drew is the mystery third member of the new Wyatt Family?
Oh yes... It's all coming together now.
Man, Alexa is so fkn cute i just want to grap her and kiss her😂
Randy go 3 years back on smack down
I don’t want this feud because the fiend is gonna have to bury Orton in order to keep his momentum. I feel like orton needs to have an actual title reign that doesn’t end quickly
Drew McIntyre needs to get out of the story
😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Prefer the old bless
She’s so fine
Drew ruined it
Well done WWE!!! I couldn’t look away! First good thing since the draft.
Hey what's wrong with the dwarf Harley Quinn XD
this is happening because randy orton set the wyatt family’s compound on fire back in 2017 on smackdown.
Remember when Randy burn Bray's house. It call Payback
Raw is red  Smack down is blue Yeah that’s all I have for you
I knew I wouldnt be long till Bray is with orton in a storyline
Alexa looks like Harley Quinn
NO NO SURVIVOR SERIES IT'S GOING TO BE ROMAN VS DREW MANIA REMATCH
RANDY VS DREW VS FIEND FOR WWE CHAMP!
I Sense a Triple Threat Match Coming And That Would Be Awsome ASF
Wow wwe make the best videos
I love how the face ( Drew ) and the face/heel ( Bray Wyatt ) " worked together" against The Viper, and even though Drew pounding on Randy was a good way to end the segment. An even better way of ending the show would've been keeping the segment the way it played out, but then have The Fiend do a Sister Abigail on Randy either into the front of the announcers table or in the middle of the ring😀😀🤙🤙
What's so special about the fiend that he is handed over the championship belt
Honestly i think that mcantyre should get the title back he is a good champ ion
i like how they bring back old storyline to make it relevant
This just shows how scary the fiend is, Randy would rather take his chances wit Drew MacIntyre then tangle wit the fiend 😂😭
The fact that they giving drew this push is stupid asf
Now this is such good shi_
Triple threat
Drew just being salty he loss his title. Temper tandrum
I love that Drew apologized to Alexa for destroying her talk show set up. Hopefully that will show that Drew won't be involved with Bray or The Fiend. Let Randy and Bray settle their beef later; keep Drew focused on winning his title back. Long story short, I hate that Randy has the title; he doesn't need it. Drew should still be the champ. Let Randy and Edge have their umpteenth rematch without the title getting in the way of that. Once they put that behind them, that's when Randy can focus on The Fiend. As for Drew I wanted it to be him vs Keith Lee for the title. Then Keith could've been the one to dethrone Drew...
Randy vs drew vs the fiend survivor series? The champion
Bliss is like some Harley Quinn but the most beautiful one ever 😂
what a bombshell nightmare of bryan 🤔
I would like to see the fiend bray wyatt vs randy orton at tlc and their fued will go on and they will clash at the royal rumble then drew mcintyre vs randy orton at wrestlemania 37
The joker and Harley Quinn take over wwe lol
So we just gonna ignore bliss arm bent
It’s crazy how WWE does their best work when there aren’t any fans.
Randy is about to Push 3 younge talents before the end of 2020 : Drew Mcintyre - The Fiend - Roman Reigns
You know his comeback story is quite impressive you can’t say the same for some superstars who got fired just like McIntyre then come back to the company that has not happened before McIntyre and his Physique level is on a competitive beast level not the beast incarnate Brock Drew’s physique is on a animal level terrifying game changer level like damn look at his physique and then tell me that he is not terrifying like that dude is one of my favorite superstars of all time his comeback story is why like there are some superstars who have not came back to the company after they got fired McIntyre being the first ever person to come back to the company ripped AF like you can’t say your favorite superstars have come back to the company that has never in WWE history happened before like McIntyre being the first ever person to have ever come back to the company no other superstars in the world has ever done that and McIntyre is my favorite superstar out of all superstars because his comeback story his inspirational story on how you can change your life and how you can complete life goals for yourself like McIntyre love your inspiration man and hopefully soon you will be champion again I hope so
Drew sadic
I guess that last RAW episode with *Randy being around fire* picture in the *FireFly Funhouse* was a foreshadow after all. Jeez it's the little things
Randy is great hopefully there’s more segments randy with the night vision Goggles 🥽 on thought that was really cool 😎
I don't know who is hotter Alexa or Sasha
The Bray Wyatt revenge tour continues.  I also love that Randy never turned around he just knew Bray was there and wanted none of it.
randy orton should join the fiend if he wants to hold that title lmao nvm...wwe should jsut give him a 5-7 reign and have him lose it to fiend
This makes no sense and I like the fiend but I mean are they gonna make randy ortin a good guy now
I would not mind if McIntyre was Champ but his comeback story from getting fired from Wwe and then coming back a machine of himself is quite impressive and from him not having that championship opportunity yet until this year is why I would love to see him again be the Champion
For a sec i thought randy was teaming up with wyatt lol
I love how they connected Orton burning down the Wyatt house
The fiend and Alexa bliss are annoying asf
TheFiend its the real wwe champion and the FUTURE HEAD BOOKER OF WWE
Can’t even lie, this was EPIC
Alexa Bliss is relishing in this and I love her for it.
Q mal reconocimiento le dieron a Randy al Champion !!!! The WWE  Con la niña boba Alexis B q no le queda ese papelito . 👎👎👎
Keep Bray out of the title picture people are tired of seeing him lose why does WWE never seem to learn from their past mistakes.
The part when the fiend was out and Randy Orton and Drew McIntyre walking towards each other the sound kind of turned off a little
Do you guys think one day Bray will revert back to his old gimmick or has he found his true calling as Funhouse/Fiend Bray?
This seem like a triple threat with the fiend winning
Who’s ready for drew to turn heel again
Is there a little Thanos in the Viper or is there a little Viper in Thanos ? ? ? 🤐 🤫 🧐 🤔 It's All in the Delivery &  Execution
Good to see Roman reigns and bray Wyatt hitting their potential in WWE. I’m happy for both of them
"The Fiend and Drew McIntyre lay trap for Randy Orton" soooo...Drew is working with The Fiend?
One of the best story lines ever
but jeff hardy 2 chans
My boy randy looked so scared he didn't even look behind him
Randy is gonna RKO Alexa. He’s RKO’d a woman before, he’ll do it again.
Smackdown big lost was Alexa & the fiend 🥺
Why tf are they showing us Bliss when Orton and McIntyre are beating the hell out of each other? It’s becoming a bit overbearing in my opinion.
When Randy pick Drew and lay him on the table I remember when he missed a claymore when he was feuding with Roman
Drew has got to get the title back
Don’t give the title to the fiend
Now RANDY destroy Fiend
It makes sense...I don't want Vince to mess with the hurt business
This is going to be awesome
Drew versus Randy is coming near the end Randy versus the fiend is next
the fiend helping another superstar, that's new
The fiend versus Randy Orton you want to know why I want that keep in mind Randy Orton Burns sister Abigail so I'm pretty sure the fiend is going on a hit list
HE NEVER FORGETS!
Looking forward to a triple threat, but not looking forward to who will get pinned. Hint: Orton will likely retain and McIntyre isn't getting pinned cleaned a second PPV in a row.
I hope Drew gets the title back
Bray is going to interfere in reigns Vs Orton then attack Orton then miz will cash in the contract and win
Orton literally got stuck between a rock and a hard place
I'd do a triple threat at Survivor Series and Drew pins Orton to get the Title back.
Here wwe goes stealing another aew idea with the eye poke
Randy vs Drew vs Fiend, If Randy is to retain he has to pin Drew and the Fiend attacks Randy after the match
Survivor series is going to be the battle of the badasses aka randy vs Roman I got Roman who ya got
This is the craziest interaction I’ve seen, never I thought I’d see randy, drew and Alexa in one room together 💀 not like this 🤣
Nobody: The fiend: 2:25 👁👅👁
I really want is war on this two.
I remember that moment when he killed sister Abigail and he burned down the Wyatt compound
The fiend never forgives and forgets
It's prolly gonna be a short run with the title for Orton.  Also, I'm gonna predict this i likely gonna lead to Fiend vs McIntyre for the title at WrestleMania. Calling it here first.
I can think of 2, maybe 3, possibly 4, definitely one, person who know bray Wyatt better than anyone Harper, Rowan, strowman, Brian, and you know, bo Dallas
drew is a sore loser
Flossing
Alexa bliss looks like Harley Quinn🤔
Guys I think the fiend is powered by revenge. He loses against people he has no need to get revenge on: Goldberg and roman reigns.   He beats all who he has yet to get revenge on.
​Jesus is coming back be ready people's
I  can’t wait to see Alexa bliss “fiend character”
wow WWE is doing the things very very very well lately. Good stories, good feuds & good matches
Drew For Champion
Drew McIntyre really looked like a heel during this confrontation
Since when was WWE a kids program lmao
I’m convinced randy could play Batman...
Que daora luta sou brasileiro
Let's make this Happen Randy vs Fiend!
0:06 i just love how alexa bliss said "no surprises" she was like "no no no thats not happening today, not here buddy boy"
I thought the fiend was going to attack orton
alexa is the best thing in wwe right now its amazing
Bray faced everyone and beat them he just needs to wrestle the undertaker
Wwe is getting better and better every week
Omg lol dont forget to rko detona’s teeth
This whole segment is gold
2007 : The Undertaker creeping behind Randy Orton  2020 : The Fiend creeping behind Randy Orton
Why do I get Harley Quinn vibe
Randy is champion again thank god
I have won the championship yeah it is not like you have declared 3 rematches no no no that would not be you Randy oh wait wait actually you have done that you lost at summerslam declared a rematch at Clash lost at clash wait that makes 2 losses and then won the championship at Hell in A Cell what a sore loser you are Randy I am not a sore loser I didn’t do such a thing we all know that is true
yess 😁 Orton vs Fiend
Oh my god 😮
ا٥٪؜^
Orton said "naw I'm good cuz
I love roleplay games too :) subscribe over here 👈
2017 Bray Wyatt vs Randy Orton WWE CHAMPIONSHIP 2020 Bray Wyatt vs Randy Orton WWE CHAMPIONSHIP
0:19  That prolly sent chills to Randy's spine!
I hope everybody appreciates how fantastic Alexa Bliss is in this role
What would be cool if the fiend tries to control randy again so he can get a pair of those sweet looking contacts
Sexy bliss
Bray trying to outsmart randy  ha
I like randy as a face
Randy is having his best year in a long time
you guys better ake Randy hold the title for more than 1 month cause you guys give randy the title then next paper view he loses it
Automatic Triple threat
let him in and let her in
Amazing match WWE 💗
I wanna see the fiend in an era with the undertaker

Dannnnng already bad to have drew if that wasn't bad enough THE FIEND also came not even the VIPER xould handle that
I love randy and I am happy he has the belt but I need drew as champion again it dosent have to be now but it needs to be soon
this is the types of storylines i want for yearsssss
SHE BROUGHT UP SISTER ABIGIGAL EOAKMEMENDNENJENEJD
I am Randy and I thought it was funny to take away Drew’s championship away from him yeah look at me I am Randy Orton and I think I am the one and only who can’t be beaten up can’t beat me I am Randy it is not like I have lost twice to Drew already and yeah I am a sore loser
They're finally paying it off
I love Alexa Bliss and The Fiend character
Bliss isn’t for that role
Randy: where is the fiend The fiend: 2:08
Let's go for triple threat match...is gonna be awesome 🤨
Imagine if Drew and Fiend teamed up
All Credit when it's due. Character work in WWE is on top level with these superstars.
Triple threat match with the fiend letting drew win the title and on the 3 count lights go black and come back with the fiend dragging randy into the ring. Drew shows up next time with the gold and fiend shows up with a randy skin belt
The FIEND CHAMPIIIOOOOONN NOOOOWWWWWW
Man this is just toooo good! 🤓
Drew will become champion again and that is a fact
Randy Orton is basically Thanos at this point...
This makes The Fiend look like a master pulling the strings of Orton and McIntyre.
alexa sexy as hell
I’ve been waiting for this storyline please for the love of god WWE don’t mess this up
If she's talk one more time, he's burn her house down and eats that damn bacon...
Smackdown team for SURVIVOR series Seth Rollins, Lars Sullivan and etc
I smell triple threat coming
Need alexa bak fighting
Randy Orton-Drew McIntyre-WWE championship A never ending love story
Yall wanted continuity yall got it just takes some time impatient  🙄
Now we have Joker and Harlequin. We need Batman!
Now we have Joker and Harlequin. We need Batman!
Omg Alexaaaaa😍😍😍😍
Una triple amenaza por el WWE Champion?! 😳
Bliss is cute but scared
Triple threat match for wwe championship thats awesome
Are we just not gonna talk about Alexa's arm 1:10😐😐
yes
DAMM Alexa Bliss is so freaking hot🔥
Orton doesn't fear the fiend,he was avoiding a 2 on 1 situation and obviously Orton has faced taker. What is the fiend to Orton.
Cute ni alexa blisss
shes so cute
Maybe Bruce prichard is doing a way better job than anyone expected
Please don't Ruin Orton now
All imma say is that this was perfection
the eye part looked so real,  they need to make it real,  decent story line.   i want to see triple threat,  but wwe will find a way to screw it up.   The Alexa thing is cool,   def the fiend character does make interests to all this.
is this real or fake
I don't like the Fiend's new mask
The Fiend gimmick is just Bray Wyatt holding really strong grudges.
Funny as is this is starting to look like Batman and Joker. Randy is “evil” Batman Bray is the Joker Alexa is Harley Quinn
Zzzz
アレクサ可愛い💞☺️なんかの芝居？
I missed raw on my birthday
The moment randy knew he duck up when The Fiend came out
That's tuff
The Fiend Bray Wyatt vs Randy Orton at Survivor Series??? Maybe a possible next match up?
Randy looks capable of beating the fiend if you ask me.
Why is drew always beating Orton in brawls? Orton can do better than that
Love The Fiend!
Triple threat?
I missed raw last night.
Alexa bliss is so over now she doesn’t need a championship to be the wwe star the best in the industry
THANK GOD The Fiend and AJ Styles came to Raw
So damn good! Alexa is amazing in this role!
Umm, if u were actually watching raw last night, did u notice alexa's new theme while opening a moment of bliss??
Harley Quinn on WWE ?
He did burn brays house
Lol in my language this trap be like "na agay ka na pechay ka"
3:19 you can see Bray walking away taking the mask off
Wannabe Harley Quinn
Get them Drew
With out a doubt drew is getting his 2x title back at survivor series
RANDY VS ROMAN  RANDY VS FIEND VS DREW
Burned the house down...  was that a reference to the wyatt compound
Drew maictyrae vs The fiend vs randy orton por el wwe champion en TLC 2020
Is WWE using fake crowd noises again? It seemes too loud to be true but it would suit this segment a lot.
Where's the respect to the legend killer and wwe champion?
orton vs fiend vs mclntrye
Wait. So is the fiend like the solo version of the shield? Just turns up for the right thing to happen?
Drew mcintyre: tries to hide his crush    Alexa Bliss: *sitting and smiling for 10 hours* btw it’s a joke
Randy and the fiend feud is gonna be sick
The best three together in the same segment, loved this 🔥 The way WWE is using the Fiend right now is just perfect ! And love to see how Orton is stuck between the Fiend and Drew, great idea because just with this you see that Orton is a bit afraid of the Fiend just with him standing behind without doing anything. This is what the Fiend is all about !
Why can't every girl be more like Alexa Bliss. 😂
So wait heel Drew?
The pen was brutal
give us a match like  in 2000 armageddon
Randy orton will hold the wwe champion until WM vs Edge.
Imagine The Fiend vs McIntyre. Both will keep kicking out at one.
Franchement je comprends pas pourquoi la WWE a donner le titre a Randy Orton. Drew représente la nouvelle génération de la WWE,même si y a quelques années en arrière il a fais partie de la WWE . Orton c est du réchauffé.C est toujours les même qu on vois Champion. Moi je suit le catch depuis plus de 30 ans et honnêtement,c est bien mieux avant. 😉
Fiend vs Killer vs Psychopath  Take all my godamn money!
2019 was such a trash year I’m glad that 2020 been good for the company.
Story wise I think the fiend should take the title off randy orton. Big fan of both of them
I’m glad the Drew Orton feud is continuing but I’m glad they are building to Face Bray vs Heel Orton
Why does drew run like that 😂😂😂
If hollywood ever do a horror movie with a female killer,  they should called Bliss to play the role......
Don’t ruin the Fiend he destroys people he doesn’t lay traps
Dayum Alexa looks more bad than Harley Quinn
What about Drew VS The Fiend VS Orton
dam i just realized the second time (this time) i watched it. BURN THE HOUSE DOWN, orton burned brays shed looking thing
I love how Randy decided to go back and fight it out with Drew instead of turning around and facing the Fiend...it was such a great minor touch
Nikki Cross would be better in that role than Bliss... just my opinion.
Omg drew u betta not join the fiend
Alexa sucks. Her character is ruining everything 🤮👎🏻  Pethetic parody on Harley Queen or some another "psycho girl". Talk sptupid things and laugh without any reason... it's annoying, not interesting.
Drew is now a heel?
Fiend was like "remember me bruh"
This just makes me feel like Randy is gonna be a transitional champion.
I forgot Bray does owe Randy his receipt from a few years back.
Just saying The Fiend and Finn Balor's alter ego would be the perfect tag team
On thing I knw bout my boy Randy the Fiend got some explaining to do. Drew And Bray about to feel the three most dangerous words in the WWE again!
I think it is dumb for Randy orton to wun the championship only to lise to tge fiend and mayve make the fiend lose it yo drew
Drew vs Orton vs The Fiend pls
I love u bliss.. You so cute!!
Let her in yowie wowie 👹 😈 👿 💀 👻 😨 😱 👽 👾 😲
I personally hope this brings back the Scottish Pychopath. I prefer heel Drew
Alexa is truly real life Harley Quinn. She’s just sitting on the turnbuckle laughing while watching Randy and Drew fight
Might be a long shot but I think this could signify a double turn between Drew and Randy. Drew didn't seem to hesitate taking advantage of the Fiend's trap for Orton and seeing how the Fiend changes his opponent's character, I could see Randy turning face.
Drew is jealous that Randy is champion
The fiend: *exists* Randy: ima just ignore him
He is so sexy
Randy completely ignored the fiend though PHEW
finllay there putting thing right were it belongs who the Fiend been after this whole Randy orton
I can see a fatal three way bray vs Randy vs drew for the wwe tittle hmm Idk might happen
Wow WWE is getting great again.
A triple threat between Randy, Drew and the Fiend would be a great match.
Randy Orton : Exists.  Drew Mcintyre : *So you've chosen death*
2:57 y’all hear what drew said?
I thought drew is gonna corupted by the fiend....
It is amazing ❤
UGH I KNEW IT
The Fiend and Randy Orton.  Get ready for some psychological warfare unlike anything we've seen before.
look at ortons face he was scared to hell
I love her 😍
4:05 throwback to the DESTRUCTION of the Sighn brothers a few years ago... 😏
Bro why didn't Drew just chuck a chair at Randy
We want thriple threat match for wwe title amongs them 👏
He will get back his title again. Mark my word Randy Orton!
When Alexa Bliss said "when you and Drew McIntyre burned the house down" 0:19, who remembered when Randy Orton burned Bray Wyatts compund. For shadowing the rivalry.
Omg This segment looking like a movie part
RAW is getting better every week.
Drew mcintyre suck that's how you know he suck really he had to get the fiend help and still getting beat up.
To these wrestling yutuber who only get to upload a little bit of wrestling .........why???? The don't upload it completely
I can finally say after so many years... THAT WAS GOOD!
The audio of fake cheers is annoying
So apparently Scottish people pose enough of a threat that you're safe to just ingore the spooky murder clown..  What did this segment actually do for the Fiend character apart from make him look like an optional side quest?
2:20 *it was at this moment that he knew....*        *he messed up*
Wanna see Drew vs. The Fiend someday.
i fw dis shii 🤝
Does this mean we won't have women on "a Moment of Bliss" anymore?
Alexa perched on the top rope like a little angel (or demon) on your shoulder
Why do i love this year for wrestling Raw is great Smackdown is great Nxt is better Aew is AEW Impact is back And especially the Fiends story
I was there at the thunderdome
I really think, that one day randy and drew will become tag Champs. From enemies to brothers. Maybe they group up and fight the fiend together at the triple treat match at tlc
is drew McIntyre gonna team up with The fiend
Please quit this rivalry
Alexa is both gorgeous & adorable dressed like this!
So Alexa is Harley Quinn, Bray Wyatt is the penguin and Drew is Two-face.
Only if wwe didn’t burry bray in the beginning could have made him look even stronger
due to bray wyatt the wwwe is like a movie story and drama funny house not like sports.
The Fiend is going to get the WWE Championship
I wish to see Retribution with Randy Orton since The Fiend was with Drew McIntyre
ORTON only delaying what's coming to him for burning down the house.
Yo lol bliss got me crying 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Funny how that the fact is wwe is bringing back 2011 raw where miz was Mr MITB and randy orton was wwe champ
"Burned the house down" randy knew what that meant after he burned down bray wyatt house years back... That was the height of Bray's character destruction coming back for vengeance now that randy has the spotlight
Randy Orton  win the Hell in the cell Alexa laugh Drew Mclntyre and the fiend came out and randy got attack by Drew Mclntyre on raw
Alexa as Sister Abigail is bone chillingly sexy.
How can you guys hate Randy Orton as a champion?! So far he's making RAW fun now as a champion and you guys wanted Drew McIntyre as a champion smh fans love complaining about everything when it comes to booking
Good1 mic
Chuky's mommy
The Fiend for WWE Champion
You a bad loser bru lol honestly I want to ser Randy vs the find I dont carê about McIntyre and Randy find anymore
Alexa Bliss 😍😍😍
Why does the title make it sound like they formed a tag team D:
This was a good segment but Why did Randy Stand their when he was in the darkness like try leaving
She used to be hot........now she's sexy af
Thats why wwe os better then AEW
SUPER 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Alexa Quinn
Abonnez-vous à ma chaîne YouTube 😉  Je vais sortir un freestyle  🤩🔥
I love bliss
Drew beter beat randy and team with fiend and loose it at WM37
Randy was too shook to even face the Fiend. The embodiment of vengeance for his past sins. This was amazing writing. Kudos.
it's great when the fiend first time appear he slain / kill the legends and that makes him becoming legend killer, now he targeting Randy Orton who is the legend killer
Alexa is amazing with this role my favorite thing to watch on raw
crazy prediction: Imagine if Drew joined Bray and Alexa in the future and formed part of a new Wyatt family. I think that would be quite cool.
Randy vs Bray again XD Plus Drew 💪
I thought the fiend attack the drew
so Alexa is a face ....hahahaha
2 years ago, I wished for this feud. I'm glad that it is a reality now and is going great. And the storyline with Alexa Bliss.... Hats off to WWE.  I'll get to smackdown later.
Randy's title reign is gonna be short-lived.
This started awesome but missed a few steps towards the end.
So a triple threat orton vs Drew vs the fiend at survivor series?
This is so amazing! Alexa has fit into her crazy role so well and I hope her and the fiend never split! This was my favorite moment of Raw tbh
Maybe will see the fiend as wwe champion soon
This is prob one of my favorite storylines ever since i was little
Well, you know you're going to have a bad time when you're surrounded by Drew and The Fiend...
Feind vs randy Orton. This should be good bc I think In 2017 randy took the wwe title from bray Wyatt
I’m Alexa bliss for Halloween
From kofi to brock to drew to randy
Is Drew joining the Fiend???
Lets forget about the Fiend for a sec, how the hell Drew and Randy doesn't go through the table but Lana does?
Randy VS Roman at survivor series is going to be epic!
Finally Raw and Smackdown have A1 storylines. Keep up the good work WWE. I hope creative doesn’t ruin it. They have to take their time don’t rush it but don’t take to long to get to the point. Don’t be afraid to have someone lose via pin fall or submission. It will not hurt anyone it’ll only make the story better and not boring.
Randy Orton vs Drew McIntyre vs The Fiend tlc match for wwe champion at tlc
I hope they don’t ruin this. They just need to keep these 4 people in this angle. Eventually Drew will move on to another feud. I just don’t hope they overbook it like they did with Drew and Orton with all these different people involved.
Randy Orton was stuck in a rock and a hard place. Between Drew McIntire & the fiend
Randy, "HE" never forgets.
Randy Orton the apx bretador and the Greatest wrestler ever
I really hope Bliss wins the Royal Rumble
WHAT SO FUNNY ALEXA?!!! THAT WILL BE YOU SOON!!!!!
Alexa bliss looks so cute
This was cool
Alexa Bliss is the greatest
alexa is WWe's harley Quinn
image if the fiend was friends with drew mcintyre that whould be so cool i love drew randy kinda sus and bad
Last year it was cucking now its eyes. Vince we need to talk about your search history.
Fiend is boring
Trap they acting like drew and the fiend but a Bear trap and took his caught him in a net 😂😂
Lol Randy’s like um Yh actually i don’t mind fighting Drew again  Also Alexa is such a good actor and this is the best version of her in my opinion
Randy...HE NEVER FORGETS
In this Rivalry i wnat the real orton the real killer the real legend killer versus bray and drew
When she said burn the house down I immediately went to my twitter
Alexa: Let me in! Me: Yes! yes! yes! I love you my love. 💜💛💚😳😍😘👑😈🔥👍👏
The fiend Alexa are on another level period
Randy turns face, which is very nice to see
I love Randy’s storytelling when the Fiend showed up. Instead of leaving and running into the Fiend he chose to go and fight Drew instead. Very well done.
Bauty couple
Alexa and the fiend
Very very best storyline
You guys remember randy and bray :l
I'm calling it!! The Fiend vs Randy Orton for the WWE Title at TLC 2020, it's happening, The Fiend never forgets!! 😀 😀
bliss and fiend was a great storyline just like joker and harley queen
So a triple threat?
Oh I get burn the house down back in 2017 randy orton burned sister Abigail's house down
This the overall best thing going on , on raw right now
Wyatt or Drew  Orton: Mini-mini my nimo, who the baddest of em all.  Went towards Drew 😆😆😆  Love to see the smile on Edge's face watching at home
Alexa is the new HARLEY QUINN
The Fiend mask looks like it came from a dime store.
Findo is a real devil👹👹👹
WWE went non pg after the show was off, as Drew continued to attack Randy, also that shot was brutal
WOW!!!
Alexa ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Alexa y they find lovpeor de lo peor en toda la trayectoria de wwe
That look of realisation on Ortons face is absolutely fantastic. His reluctance to turn around sold this perfectly. You could instantly see the fear in his body language. His hope that if he walked forward The Fiend would vanish but also he didn't want to go back to Drew either.
Alexa needs to thank her makeup person.
This storyline has gone to long
That was unnecessary of the fiend
so who’s gonna be randy next challenger? fiend or mcyintire?
Alexa is awesome
I'm hoping Drew McIntyre finally wins this feud and the title.
I was hoping an rko to alexa hohoho
Whoever wrote the The Fiend/Alexa Bliss storyline must be a DC fan.  Now they're adding Randy and Drew.  I don't know who to cheer for.  Props to them for this storyline.
WWE with no croup is so boring
Drew and fiend would make a dangerous and cool team
Gonne tell my kids this was harley quinn
WWE why are yall turning Alexa Bliss' character into a knock off Harley Quinn?
Bliss going all harley quinn now
Kevin Dunn, please get your camerapeople tester for Parkinson’s. The shaking is ridiculous.
WWE UNIVERSE: THE FIEND IS THE MOST POWERFUL BEING EVER   ULTIMATE WARRIOR: AM I A JOKE TO YOU
I'm surprised Miz havent cash in that briefcase
Please dont say were having another " eye removal " match
0:07. I love Alexa. 😈👑🔥👍👏😘😍😳💚💛💜
Does anyone else smell a triple threat at Survivor Series?
Alexa 4 Raw Women's Championship
I love how Alexa’s new persona is developing 😳  Wondering if Fiend is a tweener now 🤔
Randy Walk Back To Drew Like Yeah No I’m Not Turning Around
I love Alexa. 😘😍😳💚💜💛 Alexa is Awesome. 👍👏😈👑🔥
The Fact that Randy Orton is always going to be my favorite 🔥🔥
I KNEW THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN
I love Alexa 😘😍😳💚💜💛💟😈👑🔥👍👏
Is the fiend legacy of undertaker in wwe?
Is so Beautiful ALEXA BLISS THEQUEEN 💫♥️💋🔥👑🔥✌🤍💎💜⚡🏆🤎💖❇💚✳🧡✴🌼💛💗🖤💘❤💙💥😍💯
It would make sense that Randy and The Fiend would get into a rivalry sense ya know.......he burned down Sister Abigail
I actually think the fiend and the psychopath would be an amazing tag team!
I love the character Alexa Bliss . so cute 💕
Alexa Bliss makes the Raw🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥✨✨✨💥💯💋💋💕💞
Randy vs the fiend should be a good story
Did drew stab randy with a pen the they were on the table
I rather  Orton vs Wyatt
Man, I love the double ownage which Randy Orton receives :)
We want The Fiend as the wwe champion and Alexa Bliss as wwe women's champion 💯🔥🩸
Alexa Bliss has a career acting in her future!
1:22 sorry 😂😂😂
He doesn't forget randy ...  🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wwe boring as hell.... Is alexa supposed to be harley quinn😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣....
Alexa Bliss is so Cute and Talented 😍🤩
Looks like drew mcyntire is now washed
Alexa Bliss fits the character so well
I feel like we’re gonna get a triple threat match at Survivor Series
Randy needs a long title reign he truly deserves that long title reign. Please WWE do not screw this up .
Drew McIntyre after destroying the entire Talk Show set to it’s host: *sorry*
Why does Alexa bliss remind me of Harley Quinn
Fiend wants revenge on orton for wrestlemania 33 2017 that's why alexa said burn the house down cuz randy but brays house building up the wrestlemania feud
Orton vs Fiend... Who is face and heel Here?
1:09 your arms not supposed to do that
Match idea drew vs randy vs fiend but Alexa bliss is the referi (btw a dont known how to write referi)
History  about to  come back  and haunt orton
Woooow Amazing, "no sorprises" said Alexa
At survivor series wwe make it triple threat match
Alexa & The Fiend are the Best 🩸🔥
I like this so far. I really do. I wonder why they didn't include Alexa Bliss in the Women's 5 on 5... oh well.. their loss.. Now on to Smackdown.....
Alexa Bliss & The Fiend are just what Raw needed 💯🩸🔥
Alexa Bliss & The Fiend are the reason why I watch wwe 😈💜😈
OMG it's Alexa Bliss , Alexa Bliss is the best 🤩💜🔥
Randy: “I know Bray Wyatt better than anybody.”  Bo Dallas, Erick Rowan, Brodie Lee, and Braun Strowman: “Well yes, but actually no.”
Demn shi es kelleng et
The Fiend is the most underrated WWE superstar ever, he is entertaining and should hold the WWE title longer then he always is given..
So drew is a sore loser
Alexa is annoying now.
AJ Lee would have been great if she had Alexas role
Beautiful
I love how randy avoided the Fiend basically like delaying the inevitable... but you know every one the fiend attacks changes them Randy knowing that doesn’t want to change so he chose Drew
Go get the fein bray wite
Destroy the fiend
I rather to see gangrel's gimmick than the fiend
LMFKAOEDS ALEXA-
Randy ortan your deaf...
Drew shouldn’t have lost the WWE TITLE .... my opinion
Alexa is like harlie quinn 😂
Just let this man(Randy Orton ) stop with Drew
I love Drew but I don’t want this match again even though it’s so great. I’d much prefer Randy and The Fiend
This storyline does not suit Alexa!
Alexa bliss is playing her role soooo good
Triple threat survivor series
*Lights Out  Randy :Time to leave with my title ! Fiend behind Randy: I was there since the Beginning! ....And I’ve seen it all with my popcorn BUT NO ONE NOTICED ME!! Randy : Ok time to destroy Drew once again Fiend : Hey 👋 dude I’m here behind !! Not front HEYYY DO YOU HERE ME!!! It’s wasn’t Drew .... OH NEVER MIND
Again Alexas new persona is sexy
Alexa is more over than she ever was in any of her title reigns combined. She is playing this character perfectly!
That announce table was meant for Lana! That's why they didn't break it
Orton runs the WWE
Edge is coming back before wrestlemania watch
The people support is the key for the wrestler success
Found it funny how Drew apologized to Bliss for destroying the set haha
I miss drew as the champion I hope he wins it back🙁
Orton decided not to look back cause it's the friendship that will never ever end.
The pigtailed Alexa Bliss like a kid.
She's a great Harley Quinn type.
Way to book your Champ, Raw. First get him beaten up, then have him run away from someone else and then have him beaten up again 🤦‍♂️
I think it’s too early for The Fiend to challenge, Randy should have the title until Mania
Alexa bliss and the fiend are a great couple
Alexa Bliss is way too good, she doesn't need a title to be a star
Randy Orton must attack mcintyre bray wyatt and bliss
He really is the only reason i might come back to WWE after 3 months of not watching anything..
When the fiend is  involved  In an  storyline. it becomes  Legendary (great storyline) he never forget!   I guess I was right when I said that if Randy win the wwe championship the rating will go up and they did last night, this has been the best year for wwe,
the day will finally coming RANDY ORTON vs THE FIEND
Can somebody please tell me the name of the song of the promo between sasha and bayley?
Randy is awesome 🇮🇶🇮🇶🇮🇶
*😍Who's ever reading this God is about to bless you with more than you ask for.❤*
Listen WWE hear me Bray Wyatt is a jobber no one cares about him and btw Orton be no selling beating as well 😂😂😂😂
Looks like bray still has some control over randy still
She thinks she's in a freddy Kruger movie lol.
This is one of the best storyline in years...Alexa and The Fiend are like Joker and Harley Quinm
Who is that girl?
Thriple treat match agaiinn
Alexa Bliss: “Burn The House Down”  Randy Orton: * Vietnam Flashbacks of Burning brays  Compound
We all know fiend is gonna beat Randy for the wwe championship or beat drew who ever has the wwe championship lmao it’s easy predict
Seriously bray Wyatt in the title picture again noooooo just have face retribution  too soon for him in the title picture  Anyway he's just gonna lose to randy anyway
Alexa out there looking like an adorable chunky doll.
McIntyre should’ve Claremore bliss
LOVE RANDY
Wonderful ending!
Orton sounds alot like thanos is it only me that hearing it
The Fiend never forgets..
Randy "I know Bray Wyatt better than anybody" well... Ortan this is a completely different Bray. COMPLETELY.
I'm italian
Wwe got interesting again.. at least one thing Corona didn't fuxked up, hell in a cell was such a masterpiece!
Damn, Bliss is cute😍
Making a Triple Threat between these would be interesting and I would love the sound of it this will be such a good storyline so please don't ruin it.
Loved how that Orton was given a choice.  He either went back toward the ring to fight drew, or turned around and fought the fiend.  He knew it was a lose/lose but drew was the easier option.
So is the Friend turning face now? He's been attacking most heels recently.
Give drew wwe champion back pls
Bliss plays her new character to a T!!! Wow. She’s good
My God Orton sings like bane of the Batman
The fiend has a big nose lol
I actually want to see a storyline between randy and the boys fiend for the wwe championship
Is wrestling real or is action ,do they even fight  for real or what?
I didn't know Harley Quinn was in WWE
Ohh...
At least Orton can still act. Can't say the same for the rest of them.
The fiend  is officially baby face  and I love  it
Wwe booking themselves into a corner again, they wont take the title off orton so it means wyatt and drew lose another title match making them look weak, just keep the fiend away from the title jesus
The fiend behind Orton gave me Goosebumps!!
i think if miz cashes in it will fail cause we saw that drew and miz had a match so i think that when the miz cashes in maybe the feind or drew would  break the count or attack him so they can have a triple threat match at survivor series i hope wwe dont break this storyline cause mark my words this would be one of the best maybe the best story line of 2020
I prefer Randy over Drew honestly.
I Don't Watch WWE Anymore  Because There's To Much Randy Orton & Baylie
Sheeeesh this story line is going to be good. But get mcintyre out of the way
Bliss does her part so well! She keeps captivated in the fiend even more than wyatt himself
Just imagine at Survivor Series, The Fiend vs Roman Reigns. Champion vs Champion
Dream Triple Threat match for the WWE Championship.
Stupid drew
Glad to see them using some continuity.
Randy Orton ❤️🐍
i havent watched WWE since 2017 but to come back and see that Randy Orton is still in amazing shape is shocking dude looks exactly  the same as 2013
Orton: I’m not afraid of the fiend Fiend:let me in Orton:😳😳😳
Alexa watching drew and Randy fight, that is me rn
راح تصير عداوة شوية حلوة
The Fiend is just like "Oh you thought you were gonna run?" No, I don't think so." And Alexa watching and laughing like a kid is sinister. I absolutely love it.
Y’all already know why the fiend is after randy, not cause of the championship but for what he did to sister Abigail
Wow...Alexa is contemporary beautiful and creepy at the same time...
I miss Ronda rousy ❤️
As much as i wanna see the fiend vs randy orton it is to early to have it . Because randy just won the title and the firnd cant lose.
I see randy joining the fiend
He didn't want nothing to do with the fiend
Triple threat  Triple threat  Triple threat
Bro it must suck having two storylines when your the champ lol
Harley Quinn at the ring post Hahaaa :D
Burn the house down Flash back to where randy Orton burns bray house
The top card actually hella stacked
I hope drew beats randy before survivor series so he can win the wwe championship and take down roman reigns
Pleasantly surprised by how hot Alexa looks in this storyline. I thought they’d tone her down but she looks like a smoke show
"Burn the house down" The fiend never forgets we never forgets that day
*kick* *kick* *kick* *kick* *kick* *takes breath* *becomes the joker* SURPRISE!
0:05 *When ya got a sickass "kinda..." deathly prank ready for the bois but ya gotta keep it cool.*
I hope the Fiend starts to do psychological tricks on randy like Undertaker did Years ago
Great video
He never forgets
Listen how hyped the crowd is getting everytime the Fiend is appeared..He is the future of WWE
I think drew vs Lashley for the United States championship or drew vs fiend vs orton for wwe championship like for 1 comment for opinion 2
Bray Wyatt’s past is his future
I love how every Bray Wyatt feud involves an altercation from the past
Thanks to the Fiend and Alexxa
Awesome story line
CRINGE
Hahahaaa i like this!
Mcintayere los vs rendy orton rko
The Fiend doesn't need the WWE title right now but I'm a big fan so lets goo
Bliss has upped her stock in this story.   Keep these two together!
Anyone else think Alexa is cute af
MomentofBliss is MomentofFiend anymore
Alexa >Charlotte banks etc etc
Please wwe dont do randy vs roman reigns at SS do fiend vs randy its much better
I think that WWE already gives us Who is the next target for Bray Wyatt after he's done with Drew
Bliss is such a great actor!
If he would've looked at the camera all of a sudden that would've been an awesome yet creepy moment
I love Alexa right there. hahahaha
I’m so happy Bray Wyatt and Drew McIntyre are in top spots in WWE. They deserve it
Orton vs McIntyre vs The Fiend TLC match Would be amazing
Stop pushing Fiend. He’s a rubbish wrestler
i was expecting randy would smirk at fiend
Orton is the last one on The Fiend's hit list I believe
To be honest everyone wanted to have a triple threat championship match between Orton, Reigns and Balor but I would love to see at Survivor Series Randy Orton Vs Drew McIntyre Vs The Fiend.
Randy said NOPE! then went back to Drew.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Remember... Goldberg beat The Fiend. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Feind is gonna win the title
Shhdhdh
THIS IS A GENIUS REFERENCE back to Randy Orton‘s feud 2017 against Bray Wyatt. When Alexa said ,,Burned the house down“, I was like: OMG, you actually didn’t erase the happenings of the past and you actually connect the dots!“  The Fiend is going to hunt his past enemies and tries to destroy them in a way that Bray Wyatt couldn’t do.  That is brilliant Storytelling so far and I enjoy every bit of The Fiend and Alexa in a Mix 😍😍😍🤝
Fiend attacks Undertaker at survivor series, Orton vs Mcintyre vs Fiend for wwe title at TLC ( Orton wins by pinning Mcintyre). Fiend vs Orton at Royal Rumble for wwe title The Fiend wins. Undertaker returns after match takes out the Fiend to set up Fiend vs Undertaker for Wwe Title at Wrestlemania 37 The Fiend defeats the Undertaker.
Everyone else: “burn house comment” reminiscing of 2017 Wyatt/Orton fued, or “Orton afraid of fiend.”  Me: “When did they have Alexa add dreadlocks, like ‘funhouse’ Wyatt, to her ponytails?”
What Is Alexa Bliss Laugh With 2 With Them? For Drew & Randy?
Plz dont say that fin is the new face replacing the venom undertaker!   Plz dont do this mistake
Alexa and The Fiend is my favorite act on raw or smackdown.
When Bray is not the champion he is a lot less scarier...
damn 4hours ago
Fiend not scary
2:20 How my responsibilities are looking at me after I get paid.
I love that Drew said sorry for breaking A moment of Bliss 😂
we have dark lexi and the fiend together but now they need drew to join them
Randy Orton: "and there it is... burn the house down, huh?"   "BURN IT DOWN!" Seth Rollins(The architect) runs down and assaults randy.
Fiend the next wwe champion
It would be fun if these two join together as tag team too.
ALEXA IS LAUGHING FOR NOTHING BUT HER LAUGH IS MAKING ME LAUGH 😂
Loool
Am not sure Drew is getting his title back again
how many damn camera cuts, jeez!
Drew the fiend vs  randy
McIntyre vs Orton vs Fiend man this could be great
Orton is the only heel I feel bad for
Alexa Bliss's promo skills are exceptional. She doesn't need a title to get over. She's the most interesting character on the Raw roster. She and Bray Wyatt are gold together.
Was that more eye stuff at the end? God dammit Vince.
The Fiend standing ominously............................ 🎃
A little bit of Young Randal came out in this segment lol
WHY IS ALEXA SOOO HOT EVEN WHEN SHE EVIL :3
I wanna see a match of the fiend orton and mcintyre for wwe championship
I really believe Randy should be number 1 on The Fiend’s revenge list because he committed the ultimate sin & that’s burning down Bray’s home with Abigail in it. He tried to kill his sister so I hope Bray says that everyone Fiend & Bray ever fought was practice 4 the fight against Randy. I also hope “Wyatt Family” Bray comes out and have talk with Randy about what the Fiend will do to him.
I just remembered Miz is Mr Money in the Bank....
i want alexa and the fiend to be champions of raw so badly
fire alexa bliss please my god that was horrible to watch
Z
1:10 WTF is wrong with alexa bliss’s arm ?????
Finally randy orton champion again best for business
That's the textbook definition of being stuck between a rock and a hard place
Harley Quinn?
Man Randy deserves to be champion
Fak
Alexa Bliss. Holy hell. What stupendous character work. It's ridiculously good
Good to see randy as wwe champion again
Bliss is money give my girl a Hollywood role or something
The crazy gimmick suits Bliss so well
Really? Drew is a bit overrated
Alexa will go to into acting after wwe for sure
Bray is carrying WWE on his back!
Surprise 🤣🤣
YOU CAN RUN BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE FROM THE FIEND🔥👹
AJ LEE, NIKKI CROSS, ALEXA BLISS SHOULD BE THE FIEND'S SISTERS.
Just let this sink in randy made this man change his name so much 😂😂
_P L A Y  or  P A I N._
Alexa saved 2020
Survival series. Would have love to see Drew Vs Reigns or The Fiend vs Reigns but I hope it doesn't turns out to be Orton Vs Reigns though.
So Randy is a transitional champ?
Now randy has to end the fiend
I'm really getting tired of the ridiculous no selling in wrestling!
Nice move McIntyre...gv him more..kick his ball...😠
Bray Wyatt house...
Pls bring wrestlers who look like wrestler.. I don't wanna see any thiny short men... And believe me.. Trust me because of this you guys are losing people's attention
This can be the best feud of the year! WWE Champion Randy Orton vs Drew vs The Fiend! Wow
am delighted by the incredible love Spell of Dr Azaka, which had lead to the reunity of me and my husband after he left me and our 2 kids for another woman. After 3 years of marriage, me and my husband has been into one quarrel or the other until he finally left me and moved to Seattle to be with another woman. i felt my life was over and my kids thought they would never see their father again. i tried to be strong just for the kids but i could not control the pains that torments my heart, my heart was filled with sorrows and pains because i was really in love with my husband,  Every day and night i think of him and always wish he would come back to me, I was really upset and i needed help, so i searched for help online and I came across a website that suggested that Dr Azaka can help get ex back fast. So, I felt I should give him a try. I contacted him and he told me what to do,  he casted a love spell charm on him , and within 24 hours. my husband really called me and told me that he miss me and the kids so much, So Amazing!! So that was how he came back the next day with lots of love and joy, and he apologized for his mistake, and for the pain he caused me and the kids. Then from that day our Marriage was now stronger than how it used to be , All thanks to Dr Azaka. He is a real  powerful spell caster who is always ready and willing to help you, if you are here and you need your Ex back or your husband moved to another woman, do not cry anymore, contact this powerful spell caster now. Here’s his contact:  him at:  you can also call him or add him on WhatsApp +2349059389105 or email via drazakaspelltemple@gmail com
Orton was a smart man for not going after Fiend, instead going after Drew.
What was the trap? McIntyre was about to finish off Orton before the Fiend showed up lol
That was hilarious deciding to fight Drew! 2:13 Randy -  if I look behind me, I’m a dead man ☠️ let’s walk forward lol ain’t nothing to see over there!
Good job drew give him one more claymore kicks..
Drew going sorry to Alexa 🤣🤣 serious a triple threat between drew randy and the feind is awesome
Drew and Randys rivalry is one for the ages....it's right up there...please for the love of God let this continue on to Wrestlemania because that's where it deserves to be settled
"And there it is"
I want Drew keep the tittle.
I much love bliss smile😍😍😍
This reminds me of 2007’s Edge vs Undertaker vs Batista feud
Did Alexa bliss get under the ring
He's behind me isnt he. Fight a demonic Psychopath or fight a Scottish Psychopath? Scottish Psychopath it is.
To be honest this was funny 🤣🤣
Randy needs to be Champion for a really long time. Not like the others past reigns.
Let Randy be champion for longer please 🙏🏻🙏🏻
Alexa bliss is so harley quinn. I love it
Alexa clothes kinda look like chucky
So Randy went from laying in the ring to standing at the top of the ramp? WTF lol
ههههههههه
I have a pitch WWE... Willow vs the Fiend.. slow build up.. they cross paths every PPV.. Jeff and Alexa.. Alexa senses something.. something strange and different.. slow hints.. to the build up.. that inside Jeff is another monster.. a different kind of Fiend..
How amazing is Alexa Bliss! She's 100% into her role!! Love her work!!
We have 4 of the best in mic and in ring in a segment WWE finally has found its redemption
With the *Tribal Chief* storyline in SmackDown and *this* at RAW, _WWE is at it's finest._
It’s getting interesting now the fiend and drew McIntyre wanted this title. Yummy yumm
Goes all the way back when he burned the compound
Alexa look like harlay quinn  With me like
RKO vs Sister Abigail vs Claymore
Alexa shouldn’t mess with Orton tbh !
WWE is getting faker.. Replacing audiences with TV.. Boooooo
Randy Orton: Im done with Drew, Imma head out *Fiend appear behind him* Randy Orton: Okay imma head back in
I want to see drew vs aj vs riddle vs hardy vs Sheamus vs Bray Wyatt  6 man elimination match winner faces randy orton
If randy can fend off drew and THEN survive the fiend AND possibly edge who wants revenge, he STILL has to make sure Miz doesn’t cash in AGAIN. this might be Randy’s toughest title reign.
Randy Orton was lookin bak at tha fiend  like "I just take my chances with drew McIntyre" lol 😆 but when alexa bliss said "Burned 🔥 tha House Down" that was a flashback for randy orton when he burned down bray wyatt's home sum things u just cant forget about.
I read it wrong I thought that randy orton and the fiend set a trap for drew
Drew Sucks
This should be triple threat for WWE championship.
Bliss is so cute, just sitting there, watching them pummel one another and laughing. Loved it.
Grate section.  Love idea Orton picked his poison aka  go back to drew  rather then fiend
THE FIEND: IT WASN"T A TRAP... I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR ALEXA?
Randy choosing Drew over Fiend is hilariously sinister. I was iffy in taking the title off Drew but if it means these three feud over the title the next few months I’m all for it
The cool kid is down
Alexa the BEST!!
Lmfao randy is making a lot of enemies he had a choice drew in front or Bray in the back he got scared so he chose drew
I want Alexa Bliss to let me in 😂
Yoooo I called it
Alexa's so cute lol
When is randy's retirement?
I love Drew Mcintyre's "SURPRISE" at 1:12!
They was a team randy and bray and randy burn his house dow
I hate how they "nerfed" randy orton.he could have used a million ways to torment drew but then what he did?back suplex on table.why is he acting so cowardish?he should be a badass champion😑
Alexa looks like a five year old
Never thought they would team up
the way alexa faked her laugh. haha idiot
Alexa looks like a little girl with those double side ponytail and outfit, so cute😍
This is going to be good.....PLEASE DON’T SCREW THIS UP WWE!!!!!!!! Add a Fiend to the mix between an already volatile rivalry between McIntyre and Orton has just met an old friend who is chomping at the bit for a taste of the WWE title. HELL TO THE YES!!!!!
Hope mcintyre regains the wwe title so it could be the fiend vs the Scottish Psychopath at wrestlemania
Randy have a badass voice in this promo.
Alexa Bliss looks like a 14-year-old girl 😂🤣👏🏻!
I really like this possessed version of alexa
The Fiend coming for the WWE Championship
Bro that segment was unreal
1:23 Drew saying Sorry to Alexa Bliss for throwing out everything 😂😂😂
Sometimes I feel like this wwe is like a movie.... see alexa’s acting while laughing .... soo poor acting ....
-Randy Orton is now WWE Champion -The Miz is now Mr Money in the Bank -WWE partners with Susan G Koman again -Edge Returned in the Rumble earlier this year and had a feud with Randy -Legends such as Shawn Michaels, Ric Flair, Christian and Big Show returned for a short period of time  WWE has been kinda nostalgic recently, and i love it
R K O
Can we get randy orton vs the fiend? Vs drew mcintyre ?😂
Not a fan of this storyline to be honest.
Please We Dont  Need drew
He should've asked "Where's Husky Harris?"
So lame
Wait another injured eye?, C'mon WWE first Mysterio after that Black and now Orton this is kinda lame did you guys try to copy what happened to MOX in AEW??
alexa bliss can get da schmeat
We want fiend 👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹
Finally they are booking some stars right
I don’t wanna see another drew vs Orton match for a while please, let’s let the feud breathe and give it a break, let’s insert the fiend into it, him vs McIntyre, winner goes on to face Randy orton at tlc. Just my opinion.
Randy was smart to walk away
Whew, every week I worry they're going to mess up The Fiend, and every week so far, theyve managed to keep it good
Randy took the belt off bray 3 years ago brays gonna win the wwe title back
"SUPRISE"!!!!! whilst smashing into his face over and over HAHAHHA
Why is Alexa Harley Quinn?
For as great of a talker Bray Wyatt is the Fiend needed somebody to talk for him as like a herald of his arrival and Alexa Bliss suits that role perfectly, not only is she great on the mic but she knows how to use her expressions and mannerisms to make it that much better.
I see Drew joining Fiend and Bliss.
Drew should go get a life
Heel Randy is OP
VINCE Don't ruin the Storyline
eh randy youre old my friend 40 years old your time is done
Randy won fair and square
No one: Not even WWE: Bots:Be honest who else is a TRUE fan of WWE for over a year now
Perfect role for Alexa Bliss. She sucks as a wrestler and this keeps her out of the ring.
wwe is old people
Wwe should keep the title on Orton then at wm37 edge vs Orton for the title and then Miz cashew in wins and then on raw McIntyre takes his title back
0:19 CHILLS
Alexa is gold with this gimmick The Fiend is fire 🔥🔥
Why are we continuing this feud. Of the 3 cell matches last night, theirs was boring as. Props to Drew for going through the table, he took it like a champ. But can we please be done with this. 3 PPV matches is more than enough. Please stop.
Even creepy bliss is hot as hell.   Also not sure Drew is great for Fiend as he just doesn't give a damn and will just claymore his head off.  Which I guess is better then Roman taking his mask off and beating him with it as threatened to do...
Yowie wowie 👹 😈 👿
Triple Threat Match. TLC
Omg
When Alexa say "burn the house down" i thiking of randy Orton vs Bray Wyatt in 2017
This is the Alexa we all wanted... and we couldn't have asked for more!
This dude Orton has a whole bunch of enemies after him he has the fiend, the miz, Drew McIntyre and Edge when he returns.
Me & Alexa Bilss Hailey Baldwin Bieber we are married forever boo
Rob Doyle Randy Orton Alexa Bilss Samantha Fry
Alicia Silverstone Bat Girl Alexa Bilss Hailey Baldwin Bieber Alison NikkiBella Vanessa Hudgens Jaismine Alicia Silverstone Bat Girl Catherine Sutherland Kat Pink Ranger Hailey Baldwin Bieber
I love you Pink Ranger 2 & Kendall Jenner me Aaron Green Ranger White Ranger Justin Bieber
That my wife
She is my wife
Hahaa randy championship, just short run hahaaaaaaaaa it make me fill so great
Lexi, you are DAMN FREAKING GORGEOUS!!
OMG! THIS IS SUCH GOOD $&#@
The chickens have come to roost.
To be honest low key drew macintyre and The fiend are a good tag team
I knew this was going to happen one way or another. The moment Randy set his eyes on that title.
He burned Bray’s house and the Fiend he never forgets.
Im glad that drew lost his title
Randy Orton is smart. Between facing a new enemy that's unknown to him and a recently defeated foe, he sure made the right choice.
Drew is such a sore loser
Wished Drew Claymore kick Orton off the cell and Orton fell on back, paralyzed and Drew wins
He's Just Standing There... Menacingly!
This segment - both A Moment of Bliss and the Firefly Funhouse tonight - showed us that Alexa Bliss is doing the absolute best work of her career so far. I felt a mix of Harley Quinn and Bride of Chucky vibe (popped out huge at the Yowie Wowie on her overalls) during that whole segment. I can't even explain all the little layers that she just put together for this new version of herself. This is absolutely fantastic. And yes, storytelling continuity with the "Burnt the House Down" reference!
Would be cool to get a similar story line to the undertaker vs Orton rivalry in 2005
He didn’t run at least he walked away like a champ 😭
So.... Randy loses the title to McIntyre quickly, so that he and the Fiend can have a feud without the title. That would be great! =)
THIS IS SUCH A GOOD STORYLINE. PLEASE PLEASE DONT RUIN ITTTT!!
Wait a minute are those all TV screens in the back ground
WWE TLC DECEMBER 2020 DREW VS RANDY TLC MATCH WWE TITLE
Miz has surprises for Randy orton
The fiend reminds me of penguin from Batman for some reason
When the camera kept switching to Alexa laughing was creepy.
Wwe>>>>>>Porn
We need the old smackdown back 🤦🤦
And Orton still has Reigns to worry about too....🤷🏽‍♂️
I hate Drew
"I know the Bray Wyatt better than anybody" oh you mean you know him better than everyone since Harper and Rowan left?
How did randy get there??
damn bruh the way wwe putting it is drew mciantry and the fiend working togther
Did anyone notice Alexa bliss new theme in the beginning of the segment? It was her old theme slowed down and remixed a bit
Dont make randy look weak please
Randy orton and Seth Rollins are the only ones watchable
Ever since friend arrive and start hunting down his former friends I have been dying to see fiend vs Randy ortan
This is exactly how you win fans back WWE! Thank you!
2020 is best year of wwe ever since 2016 I don't care what anyone says that's the truth
As I predicted, Randy Orton and The Fiend are going to fued. I know it’s coming
Bliss is obviously Harley Quinn 😂
You see how much better things get when u give randy orton the championship everything just got interesting!!!!!!!!!!!
I love The Fiend gimmick. I like what they're doing with him tho some stuff they do is stupid. Like having him lose to Goldberg then dropping the title to Roman (even tho he didn't get pinned) and having him shipped off to Raw without any rematch or revenge. Hope they have him keep winning and looking dominant. Don't want him to turn into Kane later into his career and become a jobber!
Could we have Orton vs Wyatt next ?
New rivalries
Wwe is getting lame and pathetic
Please @WWE Keep this storyline for a long time. Hell if Alexa Bliss is down. Make her character slowly go insane and turn into a Fiend type for the girls Division. Just like Wyatt. That'd be so sick!!!
Oh my Lexi❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Sick of The Fiend runs after titles. He's a bigger charecter than this. Give him bigger storylines.
I love how Randy showed no fear to the Fiend, the man who fought against the Undertaker fears nothing
Gotta love the storytelling here. Randy rather face Drew agaim than The Fiend
Alexa is soooo damn boring
Claymore kick one more time
Alexa Bliss attitude is more like the harley quinn now bruh.
Smackdown team should be Roman Reigns, Big e, Seth Rollins, Alester Black, and Otis
The things I’ll do to Alex bliss 😌
It’s funny seeing drew & randy fight each other and with the feind & Alexa as well
Since there was no good wrestling programs on tonight tune into aew dark on YouTube tomorrow.
Solidify Randy's year by taking both them out at tlc in a ladder match
What "trap" tho? Where did The Fiend go?
I am absolutely loving Wrestling right now
OMG Randy's voice are so dip
Very interesting to see randy and alexa in the same ring together talking to each other . Especially this crazy alexa . 😂
Bliss is so damn good in this role.
This will definitely bring the best out of Orton again just like it did with Edge. When he's working with his closest friends, he's VERY motivated and we all know a motivated Randy Orton is the best heel in pro wrestling. Period.
💞💞💞💞When Alexa said “burned the house down” Randy immediately got the flashback of when he burned Brays house down years ago😁😁😁
I will slap Alexa bliss out of the turnbuckle just like Kurt angle’s slap of annihilation
Whoever is reading this will be Wealthy, Healthy and Successful this year. May God bless you abundantly💖🥂🙏
What survivor series should be   Fiend vs Orton  ( Honestly don’t know who should win this could be Vice Versa but I think the Fiend needs it more)  Roman vs Balor  (Roman wins but make both of them look strong in the outcome)  Hurt Business vs Retribution   ( Retribution wins, Ali wins U.S. title next night)  Team Raw(Drew, Aj, Braun, Keith,Tucker) vs Team Smackdown (Seth, Dominik, Owens, Big E, Otis )vs Team Nxt(Ciampa, O’ Riley or Cole, Kushida, Thatcher, Reed or Lumis)   (Team Raw wins have Drew win the match and if you want it to be a 1 vs 1 at the end you should do Ciampa vs Drew, I think if you have to keep doing the Seth and Mysterio storyline have them cost smackdown the win, have AJ’s bodyguard help eliminate Big E)  Shirai vs Sasha vs Asuka  ( doesn’t matter who wins)  Women’s team raw (Shayna, Jax, Bliss, Royce, Lana) vs women’s team nxt(Rhea, Ember, Kai, Shotzi, Storm)vs womens team smackdown (Bianca, Bayley, Carmella, Billie Kay, Vega or someone else)   ( Either have Lana have the winning pinfall or Have Bianca win against the odds, have a moment where Jax gets eliminated and puts Lana through the announce table but Lana makes it up at the count of 9)  New Day vs Street Profits vs Lorcan and Burch   (Lorcan and Burch win)  Gargano vs Zayn ( doesn’t matter who wins just want this match to have more than 10 minutes)  Pre Show: Santos Escobar vs Ricochet vs Kalisto Cruiserweight Championship Match  (Ricochet almost wins but Santos steals the pin to retain)   If you want the Undertaker to have one more match you could do a moment where he and Aleister Black have a confrontation   I didn’t have anything for the Miz to do but you could do backstage promos with him saying he might cash in on any champion tonight
now imma need a 10x as sadistic and vicious orton for the fiend fued
The Fiend doesnt stand a chance against orton or drew
Soon, The Fiend will become WWE Champion and Alexa Bliss will become Raw Women Champion 👍🏻
Alexa be like:when you see those bestfriends defending each other a while ago and now they turned their  back on each other🙃😊🤣
The camera-work on WWE programming is gut-churningly bad nowadays. Sheesh.
What The hell
The fiend is our Generation Undertaker and Kane 😂
I’ve never loved Alexa more - she’s incredible , sexy and scary at the same time .
Bray made is career perfect by bring out the Fiend if not he wouldn't have held the universal champion twice.. get ready to see him take the WWE champion for the 2nd time in this career because of the character The fiend.. Alexa is lucky to have a master mind like the Fiend 🔥🖕😏
Payback 2017
Alexas so cute🥺
Drew apologized to Alex for destroying the set 😂😂😂😂
Potential Eldrich Horror whose house I burned down or big angry Scottish man who I regularly kick in the head....wow I really gotta reevaluate who I start fights with
randy orton vs drew mcintyre vs the fiend triple threat Match for the wwe title at survival series or after survival series
why you turn the light off its unfair to the wrestling i dont that kind og wrestler brya whyte
*++++++++++++*
Awesome Monday Night Raw Showing Tonight WWE,This Ending Was Truly Phenomenal!!🙌🙌🙌😎😎😎🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🙏🙏🙏🔥🔥🔥👑🎉
yeees the feud i have been waiting for is finally happening fiend vs randy orton for the title
1:17 For a second I thought Bliss was still sitting on the chair when McIntyre fired it out of the ring. 😂
pls make the fiend vs Undertaker. Thats the match of very high interesting.
Orton 100% deserved that beatdown & Orton title reign better not last long
All im thinking about is if that blue mat is soft or not
Fiend : I haven’t insured that house, Randy
Drew McIntyre Vs Randy Orton Vs The Fiend For The WWE Championship BOOK IT VINCE
Just remember Randy. He never forgives. And he never, ever forgets.
Waiting for triple threat match in Summerslam event! Fiend vs Orton vs Mcintyre
I love WWE is awesome bro
OMG..Alexa look like Joker
*YOWIE WOWIE* 🔥😈🔥
Great stuff...Loved it!  🔥🔥🔥🔥
you’re laughing. drew just rushed randy and you’re laughing
How good is Bliss new role.
Why is it always the eye
It’s gonna b another lost for Bray😢
Randy Orton outsmarted The Fiend and went to Drew McIntyre. This is why you will never outsmart a viper.
Love Drew apologizing to Bliss after he tosses everything out of the ring
My best hero drew brock edge tha rock
Orton should have been claymores as soon as he chose to go after drew instead of fiend. Would have been a mad starediwn afterwards too.
I love this horror style of mind games it reminds ne of the undertaker NJPW The Great Muta and Vampiro of the Fiend keep it up and bring back Raw Underground what ever happen to it
i love you drew
I'm confused, between orton and mcintyre, which one is the heel,??
This was so good
Keep Fiend away from title picture.
Fiend need a fake long tounge with that look...
I never expected Drew and Fiend collab
Here comes a Triple Threat for the championship at Survivor Series. Don't forget this comment!
alexa bliss is harley ahhaha
Maybe there's a chance john cena will be back to assist Orton
Now Randy is Turning face..
Those them Legs though.
Como le puedo poner en español si tengo el sling tv en mi roku tv? Busqué el sap en el menu pero no me sale
I seriously don't understand why is wwe pushing Drew Soo much just like they did to Jinder Mahal in 2016???
I'm guessing triple threat match for the title at survivor series
It’s time to turn Drew heel
Will it be a triple theatre match between the fiend randy Ortan and drew
I like this a lot.
I don't like the fiend Randy needs to burn that ugly mask like he did to sister Abigail on Smackdown.
Hope there is a one can turn the fiends mind games I can see that alexa can betray wyatt in the future just like joker and harley
Why the hell is Drew McIntyre still feuding with Randy Orton for God sakes!? It’s over!
Drew said sorry to Alexa at 1:23 🤣
Why is the Fiend being thrown into the title picture again!! Just let him fight people outside it so he can stay strong!
Burned the house down. I like the reference there
Alexa bliss looks like harley quinn
I’m done with wrestling man these characters suck
Damn this reminds of when the undertaker used to scare randy all the time lol
Those claps men 👏🏻👏🏻
Nobody Me: has flashbacks of Seth “Burn It Down”
Cool, more stupid, unbelievable eyeball stuff. Almost makes me want to watch AEW. ALMOST.
I loved those smile of alexa
Did Drew jibbidy-jab Randy's eye out with a pen?
Drew is the best
Dude, the second Alexa said: "Burned the house down~" I was like oh S**t, Bray remembers! XD I can't wait for that feud to start!
Alexa Bliss the real Harley Quinn
It’s funny how it’s randy orton beefing with the 3mb members who became wee champion
Reminds me of  Batista-Taker-Edge feud
RKO was feeling avoid from behind that's stalker luckily He almost victim against RKO
This is where the Fiend belongs, in the main event picture. Dissappear every so often just to keep his character fresh, kind like the Undertaker, best Character going by a long way.
so boring
Alexa ♥
randy orton
Drew wants another hell in a cell match.
seems to me that Ortion took the lesser of the 2 evils here.  Take the fiend or Macyntire
I don't know why but it almost felt like the Fiend was kinda telling Randy to attack Drew. Almost like he was an extra voice in Ortons head. I could be wrong though.
Alexa play her character so well
Bray literally had Randy shook he really had him scared. Randy dosen't normally run (or walk) from a fight unless he's just being a coward but this was on a whole new level.
I love how cell matches mean so little that both competitors are completely fine 24 hours later
The Fiend vs Randy Orton🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The story telling in all of this is 🔥🔥🔥
How about drew McIntyre vs the fiend the winner going to be no.1 contender for WWE championship?
The Fiend vs Randy Orton🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The Fiend vs Randy Orton🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Alexas acting is amazing, she’s literally harlequin
The Fiend vs Randy Orton🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I think Drew can beat The Fiend 🤔
Triple threat 🤔
The Fiend Vs randy orton🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The Fiend Creeping behind Randy Orton back reminds me of when The Undertaker was stalking Randy Orton in the restroom 15 years ago on Smackdown.
Randy Orton and Alexa bliss its like Harley Quinn meet the Punisher its damn good
The way the video's title is set up suggests that The Fiend and McIntyre are working together. Idk, just seems as such.
It’s the subtle things in wrestling that draws me in.. the subtle things in story telling , the matches. Just the pure facial reaction and the body language of Orton in this segment was a thing of beauty.   Randy choosing to go at drew even though drew dangerous as well shows how much fear the fiend has over competitors. That put over the fiend without even fighting the fiend lol.
please just put drew on the shelf for a little bit, I reckon Randy and Bray need to redeem their terrible feud from couple years back.
It needs to be fiend vs orton drew doesnt need to get involed
Can't believe "A Moment of Bliss" got the creepy aura.
The Fiend and Drew should be a team
Please end this feud. Give the title to whoever, I prefer Randy because Drew has had it for almost a year and Randy has been jobbing for him, but for the love of god please make it stop.
Alexa Bliss is just laughing 🤣🤣🤣🤣Wow I'm loving this
Classic comic Harley Quinn's
She looks like Harley Quinn
She's playing Harley Quinn lol
Alexa is way too over with her current gimmick! best part of the fiend storyline for sure.
Alexa bliss; .... when you and Drew Mcyntre ..... burned the HOUSE down.   Randy Orton; *PTSD intensifies*
Yesssss we get the Fiend and the Viper, after what Orton did to Sister Abigail's "temple" when he was in Wyatt Family 🙏
Yeah they just gave Randy the title to protect the fiend and drew's push
i neve never admire people cheating """ to win
My God Alexa is so freaking fine...
oh god Fiend's getting beat again isn't he
One Thing Is For Certain, He NEVER FORGETS 😈👹🔥
im sure if the fiend haven't uses a technical things for himself he never win! how many times he lost ... he just only win bec he cheating.. by using an elligal eliment
1:00  Now thats how you brawl... Unlike everyone now with multiple punches...
Who will replace undertaker i miss 😢 the legend 🙌 😢
Someone liked your comment: "I pray that anyone that sees this is successful in their life!
Too bad. I wanna see Drew vs Roman as Champ vs Champ in Survivor Series. But I guess Roman will regain the championship later when Fiend costs Orton the title.
Give Alexa the Raw Women's title
Can WWE make this Orton/Fiend just between the two of them? Give McIntyre his rematch next week or something and close that chapter
At first I wasn't sure of bliss and the fiend... I didn't think bliss was fully invested in her character like Bray was.... didn't seem to believe in it as much yanno? And with characters as far fetched as these, the people presenting them HAVE to believe in it.  But I gotta admit... Bliss is starting to figure out her character more and more. She stole the show for me here, her acting all childish genuinely painted her as mentally insane and it was entertaining asf.   I feel like wrestling works when it is presented as real and believable, but has maybe one thing that simply doesn't make sense. Bray and Bliss are that thing rn. And they believe in it enough that I can get invested. Im excited about the Fiend and Bliss.  Aew had that exact thing, amoungst seemingly serious matches, you had one guy who just didn't make sense. That guy was orange cassidy. That's why he was so over. But, nowadays AEW has turned into a comedy meaningless spot fest throughout all of their roster. And so orange doesn't stand out there.... and also nothing now makes sense... AEW have lost what they started out as and have just devolved into mindless idiocy.  I'm glad WWE know how to function in that regard. They didn't look at the undertaker, then suddenly fill their entire roster with dead men and book storylines with funerals every week, devolving into nonsense which makes no sense.  They know what makes something like this special. At least, from this segment and how they are utilizing the fiend and bliss recently... They seem to. I just hope it keeps up.
Someone liked your comment: "I pray that anyone that sees this is successful in their life!
Let him in, Randy! Let him in!
Let him in!
The fiend vs randy Orton vs drew McIntyre.. 10/10 match
Fiend vs orton vs drew at survion serie broooo this is gona be awsome
Alright, Go Bray Wyatt!
You know what your sins have been, Randy😈😈
Fiend vs Mac vs Randy....  I want this ttm litteraly in survivor series
HAA HAA.
WWE has the chance to bring back Broken Dreams now for McIntyre
Randy may bow to Bray again, handing him the WWE championship 😲👹  Then it's Roman vs The Fiend at survivor series 😊
Alexa Bliss She’s the hottest damnn ♥️
If roman reigns can spear the fiend , RKO will knock out the fiend
Honestly I’m just happy Brock doesn’t have the title anymore
alexa bliss boom🍑🔥💖😍
Always Randy best
Man this show sucks nothing makes sense
Orton is probably gonna fight Bray(not the fiend) and drew at TLC. Finish the drew fued and fight the fiend/bray.Feind is probably not gonna win because I need to see edge win the wwe title 10 years after he retired
I like how they brought up that randy destroyed the Wyatt compound , the fiend really is getting pay back for all who wronged him. Alexia is so entertaining in this new role
Crazy thing and something nobody wouldve even imagined saying six months ago Randy is going to look like a baby face up against Roman.. 😳😳😳
Brewayet west not good
Don't like alexa bliss outfit. Should've been darker n more insane......her Freddy krugger sweater would've been amazing as it has the black n red. But who knows her ring gear might be darker I hope so :)
To be between drew and the fiend.. Not good..😬
I love how the fiend is always smiling to his fellow friends
Yes it will be a triple threat match
WWE plz stop put the fiend on the title picture
Even  a viper has  a weakness. The Fiend
Am I the only one that noticed they gave Drew McIntyre the Kofi Kingston treatment? Both men became the first born of their respective countries to get the wwe championship, both reign lasted from wrestlemainia to October, except Drew got a longer match to lose his championship
The man won the title yesterday and the fans will turn on him already because of the fiend kkkkkkk.
Broh Randy is so talented he just walk of
If i want anyone in wwe  that is  alexa  blisss
He just bray wyatt with mask, why u look so scare randy ....
Mind games shouldn't work on Orton anymore.  After Hunter helped him and Taker being Taker
Alexa is having so much fun working with Bray and playing this character, it just shows.
Does the fiend bring back burn in my light?!?!? The best theme?!?
WOW!!!!!!!!!!
Alexa got me rolling. 😂😂😂😂
So is alexa done wrestling now or what?
Tbh I don't see this new Alexa gimmick lasting long, I mean isn't it her job to be wrestling in actual matches? When's the last time she had one?
Triple thread match
don't trun back randy if you turn back you will know what gotta happen to you randy 😂😂😂 you can not run away from the fiend, randy. the fiend will let in you randy, what i have been waiting for, it nearly coming. The Fiend vs Randy (c) will happen soon. the viper, the RKO, the legend killer Randy orton will be mandible claw and sister albigail by the fiend😱😱😱
Something about her attire makes me think of chicly In child’s play
Let Me In
Fans went wild here
Kiss her feet
I’m just geekin over the fact randy Orton is holding the wwe championship again!
Am I Sensing The Fiend Vs Orton Vs McIntyre In A Triple Threat Match For The WWE Championship At TLC
*HIM*
Fiend will be wwe champ in no time.
So the fiend turn face ? I cant believe it
Its been a long time since we actually saw the Wwe Title with an actual great feud plus The Fiend joining in the feud is a good choice
Alexa Overacting
The way Alexa plays her role as a creepy friendly girl is adorable
Imagine Randy Orton punt kick The Fiend and he gets back up immediately(no sells it)
HARLEY QUEEN = ALEXA BLISS
Bro, yeah Randy is at the top of his game, Drew is a beast, but The Fiend and Alexa are just what Raw needed. 💯
Alexa it's very cute
Imagine Randy rko Alexa and she no sells it.
That’s crazy they ended Raw on a high note 🔥🔥🔥
Werstlmanya 33 randy bray
Nice nice
1:13 McIntyre: Surprise....
1:45 -- Teleportation Rule in effect: FF>>
Ah yes, "Burned the house down", got flashbacks of Orton burning Sister Abigail's home in '17.
This role and persona is literal perfection for Lexi. 🙌👌
Drew McIntyre look like in God form.
I like to see Natalya making alliance with Drew McIntyre against Alexa Bliss and The Fiend Bray Wyatt.
She is nearly becoming a Harley Quinn...
Randy is smart smart
RIP Vince mcmahon
Scary Bliss
yes! i'm getting my wish!  Legend Killer vs The Fiend
Fiend has mind games , Randy has mind games.. This fued should be good !
*Reads title* : well, that's not good
Yeahhh! Yeahhhhhhhhhhhh! Alexa yeah! 👏🏿👏🏿
Hear my idea, I say The Fiend keep protecting Orton and they kinda make a team then at Rr, The Fiend wins and challenges Orton at mania and it would basically be the full circle from 4 years ago when Randy won the title from Bray, instead The Fiend wins this time. Ik there is alot of speculation about Randy vs Edge but I wont mind this rivalry.
I hope they let orton keep the title for a little bit so miz can cash in
Randy orton will get back revenge to drew and the fiend and then the will know randy true side
I’ll make the same decision.. I’ll pick drew over the fiend any day 😂
If they make a triple threat match and they let drew getting pinned I am quitting watching wwe raw only I am watching smackdown because of Sasha
The blue carpet does look good for the ring ... perhaps WWE can consider using it for matches.
Alexa Bliss doing the best work of her career.
Bliss 😍
Please give randy the title for quite a bit please
Not really a fan of the fiend, he's too staged
Why does Randy look weak most of the times now
Who else was expecting Seth Rollins to return when said “burn the house down”
I was actually expecting The Fiend to attack Drew and keep protecting Randy for the next month or two
Bray Wyatt is a creative genius.He made Alexa the most interesting thing in WWE without a title on her shoulder. BTW,Alexa's acting skills are out of this world as well.
Drew turns heel on Orton
Its so great to see randy with the championship on his shoulders, and Randy's past has caught up to him.
I want to see Wwe vs AEW fight! No cap
I really love Alexa gimmick ❤️
Lmaooo never seen Randy this uncomfortable
I love Alexa Bliss new character
If the fiend gets the championship again they better not screw him over like they did at payback
Alexa is like Harley quinn
Please God don't give The Fiend a title!!!! If he has a title then that means he is guaranteed to lose eventually and usually it's too soon. Leave him out of that picture and let him be an unstoppable monster for a while
The GOAT Is Jericho
I remember when he burned the house, with the soul of sister abigail! That moment was terrified. I will live this feud between Randy and The Fiend
You can’t keep having the WWE champ getting beat up every time, it’s inconvenient.
Miz is going to be the WWE champ before the end of this year just like 2010  &Forget about the fiend they always screw him...
Old school brawl
a huge improvement over images of snakes in the ring
Where are the pumpkins for Halloween? They always have them out on the weeok of Halloween.😆😆
I mean, I love that style of alexa bliss, but I'm used to something else of her not this... Idk xD
Drew Is a great champion , all universe wants see recovery your title
Is Alexa bliss her attiere inspired by Chucky???
What was the point of having the fiend there
To those comparing The Fiend & The Undertaker, please.. Stop It.😒🙏
Imagine crazy randy orton vs the fiend oof
1:12 I wouldnt blame bliss for laughing 😂
Hopefully, McIntyre gets another title run in the future. Probably Universal champion
*G*            *A*            *Y*
Drew become new míster money in the Bank
Alexa, will you marry me? ❤️
So does being the legend killer mean randy has to kill his own career ?🤣🤣
Bring back the spinner belt. The only championship that looks good on orton.
I tried I can’t watch this shi5 . I will stick with Impact and AEW!
Good god. Wowwww Fiend vs orton vs drew
Triple threat TLC match for the WWE title book it
legend says the fiend still stood there until now.
gg
Randy orton vs Drew McIntyre vs the fiend Tlc
I love how she brought up burn the house down, because that’s what happened the last time Randy Orton became WWE Champion. And now Bray Wyatt has a lil payback for Randy killing the spirit of Sister Abigail and turning him into the man in the woods. 😈😈😈
Cute and scary.
Drew new míster money in the Bank
The fiend will take back what was stolen from him
Randy orton not rkoing Alexa bliss in this feud with the fiend will be a massive missed opportunity for a memorable spot imo
They're giving her the Stratus treatment. Shows, promos with the guys,  constant TV time even without a title. Damn, now do that with some of the other women.
I FEAL LIKE 5 PEOPLE SHOULD OR SHOULDVE BEEN THE ONES TO BEAT THE FIEND: Dean ambrose, the undertaker, braun strowman, the demon king finn balor, and randy orton.           Wwe is screwing braun over just like they did big show.
Why is Mcintyre attacking randy? He lost clean?
I think Orton just had a chill go down his spine when he knew the fiend was right behind him the apex predator turned prey there's a fight id watch
Well I resubbed again. Loving what you guys are doing with Bliss and The Fiend. Keep it up! 😃
Alexa plays her roll great .she can be in the next chucky movie
never noticed it but Randy's trunks have black scales on it.
See how Drew stuck a Pen in Randy’s eye at the end hopefully they play this off like nothing happened
So is this why they made Randy win I  will love this story
It’s amazing how Randy Orton can thrive in a scripted environment.
We all know this will happened when this segment was announced
DON'T LET THIS DISTRACT YOU FROM THE FACT THAT LANA GOT PUT THROUGH A TABLE AGAIN!!!
The fiend doesn't need to be in the title picture like Kane back in the day. Alexa should go for the women's title though.
My daugther she names Alexa for Alexa Bliss
hello WWE, can you please make a phone review on the new iphone 12 because i'm planning to buy it next week.
Alexa married me XD
Poor Randy thought Drew would be the safer route only to end up with a pen in his eye
Alexa bliss is looks like harley quinn who need a joker haha whos with me  make it blue 👇
That was kinda weird for them to reset the fight after the lights went out but I'm liking the story linking with a previous story!
Love how these story threads are all coming together ...
*Raw Underground* needs to be back ASAP!!!
Randy did the right thing to go down to Drew because he know what the fiend is made of the fiend character is way more different than the Fiend
Wow, Alexa’s facial expressions are on point
I am boring to watch orton vs mcintyre again again again and again!
Who is the best wrestler of Long Term Storylines Feud? The answer is Bray Wyatt
So many cuts man
Alexa looks so gorgeous in this look! Love the Harley Quinn hair
All I want now is the fiend to become WWE champion
Terrible product
Burned the house down ohhhh
Just make the rookie killer a gimmick already
I hope randy can give rko for Alexa bliss
It makes perfect sense Bray Wyatt would come after Randy Orton seeing as though Randy deserved it coming to him after the whole Randy burning the house that housed the soul of Sister Abigail but hopefully we see Bray win the WWE Title again because his reign in 2017 could’ve been better I mean he dropped the title to Randy Orton which I didn’t like but made sense because of the whole Randy didn’t when last time he won the Royal Rumble in 2009 and didn’t beat Triple H for the WWE Title at Wrestlemania 25 also Randy and Bray has more better story telling
Alexa Bliss looks like your girlfriend Watching you fight some other dude who makes fun about your girlfriend
What’s the point?
Randy Orton deserved this WWE Championship  after he won
How are there still people out there who say randy isn't great. When he's into a storyline there literally no one better
Alexa bliss says "burned the house down" randy: immediate flashbacks to 2017.  Edit: thanks for all the likes guys, stay safe!!
Wwe has made their products unwatchable with all the cameras shaking.
The Fiend Never Forgets
Wow Randy champion is beatiful 😻
Just talking about this segment only...  Orton=Batman McIntyre=Superman Fiend=Joker Alexa=Harley Quinn
*THE VIPER VS. THE FIEND*
Good for WWE, dragging the old Orton vs Wyatt feud. Mentioning, "Burned the house down" really meant the time when Orton burned "Sister Abigail's House"
The fiend is the modern day Kane when he debuted. Just an absolute machine.
Honestly wish Alexa was on the women’s team instead of Lana
They should just let this feud for Wrestlemania since Orton defeated Bray at mania 3 years ago
Alexa looks like Harley Quinn  She even laughs like her😬
In the famous lyrics of The Talking Heads; "BURNING DOWN THE HOUSE"
can Randy Orton punt Alexa Bless or burned his house down again? lol
Randy orton vs the fiend brayt wyatt
Alexa: no surprises   Randy: damit
The Fiend vs Randy Orton or The Fiend vs Drew Mcintyre? Both will be amazing feuds
Randy orton dont give a damn about the fiend, he beat him after winning the rr and giving it up and then winning again and beating him. Randy aint scared of nothing
Alexa is just amazing
So if you don’t look at The Fiend he can’t get you BINGO❗️
Randy orton choose to go down because he know what the fiend is made of Randy and the fiend it will be a good clash but the fiend 💯
Drew McIntyre vs Roman Reigns survivor series universal championship match
Not saying the fiend shouldn't have the title or get another opportunity again but every one of his matches is either for the title or defending the title. Let him wrestle some non title matches stop putting him in the title picture constantly
So why was he there just watching, not exactly a trap
So IDK what to say , but I'm really excited for the future Mondays, because Raw is on Fireeeeeee. The Hurt Bussiness, Shayna Baszler & And WWe Championship feud are great. I love both Randy and Drew as champs so I don't mind who holds it.
Damn uce did you see that
Well if Randy beating Drew wasn't going to lead to Edge's return. The Fiend getting in on this is the next best thing.
1:24 drew's face hahaha! He's like: "well that's that"
i want The Legend Killer to be back
Alexa bliss is very weak at the role thast she playing with bray wwe is really so stupid why didn't they bring rosemary she fits bray waytt with her role not Alexa bliss....STUPID
Alexa laughing:hahahahahaha  He punch like a little kids
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Survivor series rko VS spear
The Fiend better beat Orton
Everything about this screams match of the year triple threat, bring it on!
😯  😃
I knewww we see them fight again
what's better like wwe comment aew don't say anything if you hate both
McIntyre just sucks as a babyface
One rko to      🐍🐍.   the fiend. Vs drew conform death 💀
Wondering what if Randy Orton of WWE vs Tetsuya Naito of NJPW?
Fiend vs Orton Book it 🔥 🔥
BURN THE HOUSE REFERENCE GOES TO WHEN RANDY BURNT BRAYS HOUSE
Triple Threat at Survivor Series!
These storyline between Alexa and bray may be the best of 2020 for wwe,feel like the 2000’s and I like it
So is Randy Orton a half heel and half face? Face or Heel tho Randy Orton is a LIVING LEGEND
Alexa ova there in the corner just like pointing at em just laugying she crzaze craze
PATIENTLY WAITING FOR CESARO’S PUSH
Alexa reminds me of Harley Quinn
So Bray showed Randy how to see in the dark
Randy really sold it when the Fiend was behind him. Great job looking like he had no choice but to face Drew really helped to make the Fiend feel scary
So the Fiend appear....just to disappear....okay 🤔
Pls wwe dont include drew in this fued lets have fiend and orton only and have the fiend win the title from him
If Drew McIntyre joins the Fiend, I would go nuts.
Randy had to pick his poison and he chose Drew. But you can’t run for long because HE is watching you.
drew is just a sore loser
Orton vs Fiend.  Called it. hahahaha
She is so cute and awesome 😍
God bless God love u
I think Alexa forgot women get rko'd to
TLC randy vs drew vs the fiend TAKE MY MONEY
Let this not distract you from the fact that this is the 1st time Bliss and Orton had a segment
Im so glad Randy, champ, he deserves it
Alexa the way u r giggling and laughing doesn't suit you at all
Waiting for drew revenge 🔥
Alexa's freaking great with her portrayal of this role.
Make the fiend and alexa champions of raw they are best thing on the show
Wow they were so sloppy in their battle.. looked terrible.. guess I just miss Brock 🤣🤦‍♂️
Whos heel?
I cant wait for the new Wyatt family is gone be alsome
The fiend doesn't need a title to be good. That needs to stop being his defining character trait.
The fiend is money!¡¡¡!
Meh.    *Not feeling Alexa Bliss in this new role*
Ngl Raw is getting entertaining especially this storyline of Randy's history with Bray and now Drew getting involved which hopefully we get to see him against the Fiend in the future 🔥
I can sence a tripple treat at tlc and miz cashes in the briefcase to become champion😔
Please WWE no more Orton's face turns they're suck as f
The fiend as just become another thing to over show
The Future Of The Fiend Brey Wyatt Is Like The Undertaker Streak Will Retire And Become Weak Hall Of Famer  We Fiend Vs Angel Garza  Garza Def The Feind By Pinfull Zoon But The Future Of Seth Rollins Is Batter Then More
Awful raw
Wwe no more drew vs randy
I’m nowhere near becoming a simp until Chucky Alexa came😍
Saatnya pensiun Randy orton gantian yg muda 😀 2050
Imagine angry Randy Orton of 2011
This was great watch this...👍🏼👍🏼
Let’s just hope drew doesn’t ruin the feud but then again drew vs randy vs the fiend would be a great match
Awkward moment when the legend killer becomes a legend himself.
*PTSD INTENSIFIED*
Raw sucks😂😂😂😂😂
The Fiend’s face Turn
Alexa Bliss is gold in this role.
Bliss is creepy
Triple threat match is what I see coming up agree or disagree?
It's odd but Alexa is adorable 😍
The wyatt family versus randy was one of my favorite story lines again. And it looks like something similar is coming. I'm so exciteddddd
So... What is the fiend gonna do to Orton? Turn him face?
So randy is going against the fiend guy and Roman reigns so is the wwe universe supposed to relate to bray Wyatt and have empathy for a guy that doesn’t get hurt and when Roman reigns vs randy orton that’s even more confusing because you got a guy who beat up wwe legends that everyone loves and then you got a guy who just beat up his cousins kayfabe is existing
I know this would  happen
The way Randy conveys emotions is unmatched, his expression, the little details, his acting's just great overall.
Good thanks
The feud between McIntyre and Orton is not over!
Alexa Bliss is saving Raw from being a completely wasteful program!
The fired plessis vs ortane
How is it possible that Alexa Bliss has manged to look even more beautiful than she normally is....?
The Next undertaker
Welp im re invested in to RAW leggo this was FIRE
The fiend pls heading to brother nero
0:29 I have no more stress with the help of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
Randy orton is a 🐐 loved how he looked at the fiend then casually walked back to McIntyre to finish the brawl
man wwe is really great right now wish we had crowds back
Nov 22, 2020 Rawvs raw vs raw The fiendvs drew vs orton for the championship
this whole segment gave me goosebumps
It's funny how the last time Orton won WWE championship he beat Bray Wyatt for it it looks like Alexa Bliss is throwing hands fiend has his eyes on the Viper and his championship
Alexa Bliss/Abigail Wyatt es una niña y Marcos Winchestee hara el SABROCENA con ella
Randys past is coming to get him
I'd rather see another roman reigns vs brock lesnar match than another drew vs randy match like if you agree
McIntire should have never lost the title. More BS from Vinny, ugh...
Best Raw in some time
Man drew mad sick of it
the viper has been caught
Whoever wins will have to take a loss to roman reigns no way Vince's golden big dog is going to loose a champion vs champion match.
How
The fiend vs drew next Monday winner face randy at tlc
I bet he interferes in randy and romans match
And why does always "the fiend" makes himself the stronger one   Hes like a kid to be honest   And he jus attacks people from behind that coward   If roman reighns or randy go to face him alone hes doomed cuz in my opinion roman is the best wrestler in history and randy is second and triple h is the third in history
So let me get this straight Randy Orton Beats Drew McIntyre fair and square no cheating Andrew McIntyre is a sore loser going around beating up Randy Orton wow
ok so now harly quinn ripoff.........
i really don't like the fiend and Alexa i hate always them
Will the fiend become wwe champion
Why is drew attacking randy ?  Is he turned heel or he is just a bad loser ?
Wow so Drew is using heel táctics now
Thank you to alexa and the fiend for making WWE a little more better in 2020
I SAW ME!!!!!!!!!!! FINALLY... THE RODO HAS BEEN SHOWN IN THE THUNDERDOME!!!!! (The Rock's catchphrase). My very first thunderdome experience.
Drew you lost at hell in a cell your the one to blame🤔🤔🤔
I kinda wanted the fiend and Drew McIntyre face off
When I watch this live I heard alexas new theme song its really cool
In time we can finally se randy orton rko the fiend and punt too the skull cant wait
LOOK BACK TOO THIS WHOLE THING MAKES ME WONDER IF THE FIREFLY FUNHOUSE WAS APART OF THE HOUSE THAT GOT BURNED DOWN IN 2017 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯💯
Alexa continues to slay this role week after week.
So Drew turned heel again?
Who could not forget the day Randy Orton burned Bray Wyatt's compound?
I would rather choose drew vs roman at SS
Randy Orton had an RPG moment a minute. Choose the Fiend turn face, Choose Drew and stay heel. Also Alexa Bliss is killing her role. Bravo
Bliss is looking sexy as hell. I guess WWE finally found a way to implement the Harley Quinn character into her gimmick
Randy Orton is the goat agree or disagree
that’s how u create a Triple Threat Match
i new this would happen
With this attack, I am sure there will be championship rematch for them on next week to challenge Reign on Survivor Series. I know people side with Drew to get him on Survivor Series 2020.
How stupid mcintyre can be when randy has win fair and square. While he win it the last time with the help of the legend. Just show how much randy is better than him
I expected Randy to say: "I am Batman" 😁😁😁😎
I love WWE who loves WWE too
Fantastic, another 2 second title reign for Randy I’m assuming? How does this even fit in to the Legend Killer theme or did they toss that out already 🤦🏽‍♂️
So a fake Harley Quinn bit?
Hears why I love this Alexa Bliss, the way she points at randy and drew brawling 😂
Randy vs the fiend randy wins rko outta nowhere
Made it sound like Drew and Fiend are a team
U know wwe can sometimes be dumb because they said edge is returning, and right now is the  best moment for Edge to come back face Orton win, then fave roman at survivor series
I like to see alexa bliss, damn she's cute 🥰
For a sec... Thought he was going to toss Mrs. Bliss.... I would've 😉
Don't think Drew and Randy should fight again, Fiend & Randy would be nice but I'm assuming we're about to have lots of "invasions" so heel Roman vs heel Randy should be sweet
Look like they're not done with Orton & McIntyre even though Orton beated McIntyre for the title at HIAC that would made sense to end their feud since SummerSlam. Howevr it look like that isn't the case I don't know what more is needed in this.
Idk why but a triple threat with the fiend orton and mcintyre sounds really good to me.
Give the title to ortan,then on raw bury him.
Esto es un teatro
i think in survivor series 2020 is randy orton vs drew vs the fiend for the world championship
Randy Orton would rather fight Drew lol
Not even in the same conversation
Umm...not meant to give any idea but,The Fiend with Drew?.Looks and sounds kinda cool,though!.🤔🙂
Why is drew such a cry baby like randy won enough
So who’s the heel?
it's like chucky again
I understand Orton can be champion as I respect that but everyone wants to see Drew vs Reign on Survivor Series as their approval even RAW superstars think he is the worthy chosen opponent for Reign on Survivor Series include Reign will be agreeable about that to see a champion who is a strong aura to challenge his might(he thinks Orton is such second-best to be disapproval about him as worse than Reign). Orton can have that title after Survivor Series 2020 as we will fine to rewrite history.
i want the fiend vs randy
These guys are so savage...... like seriously
fiend mcintyre tag team
Drew vs Randy vs the fiend for the Wwe championship
This is not a prediction, this is a spoiler: Drew McIntyre vs The Fiend vs Randy Orton In a triple threat match for the WWE Championship at Survivor Series.
BURN. THE. HOUSE. DOWN !!!!!!!  🤯🤯🤯🤯💯
Orton vs edge mania
I could see this happening: Drew McIntyre vs Randy Orton vs The Fiend Survivor Series
j
The fiend doesn’t need titles but I guess wwe never learned the lessons
Goes back to a week or two ago. Bray's play house and he had a pictute of his house that randy Orton burned down. Wwe with the Easter eggs
The goddess is the best
Why was Drew mad? Randy won fair and square.
I couldn't get behind this Fiend character in the beginning, but since they threw Alexa into the mix, I'm starting to enjoy it. My only question though is she(Alexa) supposed to be Sister Abigail??
Orton: "Man, I'm not fighting Drew again!" *Lights go out and The Fiend is behind him* Orton: "One second thought, Drew isn't that bad a guy!"
WWE IM DISAPPOINTED IN YOU THIS IS ORTONS TIME AS CHAMPION
Yo what if drew the fiend and alexa bliss get together
This Twisted New Bliss is😍tho!! Crazy that The Fiend still holds Grudges against Randy Orton for Burning The Wyatt Family House down🔥.....we could get "Randy Orton VS Drew McIntyre VS The Fiend" Triple Threat Match for the WWE Championship!!
Alexa was so adorable here
Akexa Bliss is so crazy but yet so damn adorable. I love it ahaha.
Interesting so this will turn into a Triple Threat Match for the WWE title.
Drew mcintyre and fiend raw tag champions
Drew just accept that L you took last night and move on
WWE WTF IS THIS!!!! HOW ARE YOU GONNA DO RANDY ORTON LIKE THIS!!! ORTON IS UR WWE CHAMPION!!!! HE IS CHAMPION FOR A REASON!
The two members of Wyatt family crossed their paths again 😅: Bray Wyatt and Randy Orton
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯 GREAT ENDING. IT LOOKS LIKE IT’S ALL COMING FULL CIRCLE   THE VIPER SCOTTISH TERMINATOR THE FIEND   😈😈😈💯
The WWE Writers screwed up this storyline.  Personally I would of had Orton be champion at the Royal Rumble so that at WrestleMania his opponent will be Edge for the Title.  Meanwhile Reigns will have issues at his WrestleMania opponent who is the true tribal leader and People Champion the Rock.  If this goes as planned then 2021 will be the WrestleMania that everyone is looking forward to see.
Not this again
3 words for you Claymore Kick.
alexa is so cuteee......
So Drew is heel now?
Why will Alexis cast her role like a mixture of Harley Quinn ( comic version not the Margot version!) and Chucky  The killers pope ( the mark hamill Version) What do the wwe writers do for a long time?
Let Me In
I was waiting for this since wm
Drew you are the best king 👑
Greatest rivalry ever!
Harley quinn that u😃
Drew screaming surprise to Randy while beating the hell out of him is gold.
What did we learn?   Dont put the damn fiend in the title picture
The Scottish Psychopath: Drew McIntyre The Legend Killer: Randy Orton(WWE Champion) The Fiend: Bray Wyatt Dream Triple Threat match for the WWE Championship.
if you guys find a way to make alexa a champion after this im going to flip my head. Shes perfect like that let us have other storylines without her as champ
Alexa bliss playing her hole so well
I hope they use Alexa's past history like they do with Bray
Alexa’s mental health as a CHARACTER is really good! Every week she changes her looks bit by bit and acts more strange every week and then soon she will turn into another fiend I think!
Mclntyre thanks for you
Randy said nah I'll rather fight Drew I don't wanna die tonight
OMG Alexa’s Outfit in this segment looks like Susie(Impact Wrestling) wearing Allie’s(Impact Wrestling) Casual Outfit
WWE put the wwe title on randy to prevent themselves from booking themselves into a corner with bray vs drew
Alexa looking hella cute. She can poison me any time.
Alexa bliss looks like a chucky
💀
"Burned the house down."  The Fiend remembers...  I also loved how Randy didn't even turn around to look at the Fiend.
Yeah , I would’ve also chose Drew over The Fiend 😂
Monster
I think drew and the fiend should team up together
At least he said sorry to Alexa
The Fiend Never Forgets Randy 👀
U burn down one cannot j m damn his sister n he tripping
Holy mother of jesus, Alexa bliss is so cute😍
I love Alexa so much
The Fiend will beat Randy Orton
What
Wait So is Drew still face and The Fiend and Alexa are Babyface?  I mean Orton’s Heel Though
Make Alexa and Bray champions
* As The Fiend pops up behind The Viper he says: * _"Oh Randall..._ We've unfinished business you and I."
Alexa Bliss is the best
Play. Pain. Let Her In.
Alexa will change Nikki with the Play glove
I mean you gotta give credit to Orton. Randy putting over Bray. Just realising he was behind him and deciding Drew was the lesser of two evils. Great little bit of storytelling.
Alexa Bliss is the star of Monday Night Raw.
A Moment of Bliss time!
Wow what a storyline 🔥🔥🔥
Alexa is great in this new role and The Fiend is even more creepy damnnn, either way Orton is in a lose-lose situation right now!
Alexa main eventing Raw is beautiful
Alexa Bliss as Harley Quinn 🔥
Happy Tuesday have a great day
Alexa is the best actress in WWE
Why are we still continuing Drew vs Orton when we already started something with The Fiend?
NEW ALEXA BLISS THEME SONG!
Alexa and Bray make Raw the A show for me
Cool segment but wtf is with the camera angles at 1:26
Lmfao at people thinking Randy Orton is the babyface 😭
Welp, Im already tired of the Harley angle
Alexa and Bray are definitely not heels
Alexa and Bray as champions of Raw
Legend has it that randy & drew are still fighting around the announce table
I noticed that Reference From When he burned Sister Abigail’s house 🏠 “Burned  🔥🔥🔥the house down”
The fiend vs randy orton but miz cash in but this time randy hit him with a rko
He's just standing there    MENACINGLY
I think next week should end with a Brawl between Orton, Mcintyre, The Fiend, RETRIBUTION, and The Hurt Business,
At least for now there not gonna do like they did with Kofi and put him back on mid card and act like he never was a world champion.
alexa is doing so good on her role with the fiend
I don’t get it becuse Alexa she used to be nice I did t know she was Sister Abigail
The fiend vs randy orton vs drew McIntyre at the royal rumble  calling it now
Randy face turn
you know, alexa would be especially salty about randy, since bringing alexa in as a disciple of the fiend, or whatever they are, is probably also a reference to when we all thought alexa was gonna become sister abigail,
Es posible una lucha triple amenaza?
Hi
Can I say I loved how Randy is just like "... if I turn around, he'll attack, so... NOPE... NOPE."
Bray Wyatt most definitely should be in the hall of fame   WWE has buried him multiple times and he’s still managed to not be affected by it
The Fiend: Great.. I thought you turned to my attention..
Drew doesnt really need to have the title.
Randy Orton and Alexa Bliss would have been great to play Batman and Harley Quinn.
Jajajaja jaja a y todavía hay gente que dice que randy es un digno campeón cuando claramente está de transición. Y que bueno la verdad porque todo indica que esta ayudando a drew y The fiend a levantaras sus carreras
I expecting the returning of Edge to battle them into a championship match but not 😔😔
What is it with the eye thing is WWE trying to make everyone go blind
Randy sounds so much like Josh Brolin lmao
Randy out here looking like a face again
Randy Orton burned down the Wyatt compound a couple years back. You gotta love that they subliminally bring up past things for the fiends storylines.
Anything Wyatt touches right now instantly becomes gold.  WWE needs to protect this man  at all cost
0:40 When Randy Orton actually would have been the greatest movie Batman.
wow omg wwe is incredible
Triple threat match for the title?
I love Alexa, don't get me wrong, but I really think Randy should RKO her at some point in this fued, he'll have to show that he can be evil enough to beat The Fiend. Also can't wait to see The Fiend no sell a punt kick
Drew beat Orton 2times  Drew is gonna kill Orton And became our new 2time world champ!!!!! Drew is awesome
THE FIEND VS ORTON YES YES YES IT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE OF THEIR HISTORY
I just realized something...Lana didn't go through a table this week.
Ugh @ making Alexa look like a pre pubescent school girl
Randy Orton finally meets Harley Quinn. :P
I expect Bray and Alexa to burn Randy's house down by the end of this now. Just saying. Also, justice for that cameraman who was never shown leaving the Wyatt Compound the night it burned.
Alexia Bliss: Psychotic Harley Quinn  the Fiend: Demonic Joker  Randy Orton: Sadistic Batman
Randy Orton is LEGEND KILLER and he will kill The Stalker!
orton vs drew vs the fiend
The Fiend vs Randy Orton should be the endgame at this WM instead of the alleged Edge vs Randy Orton
Didn't waste time did they?
Burned the house down I get it
The Fiend vs Randy Orton vs Drew McIntyre triple Threat Match. For WWE Championship
If drew joins the firefly house that would be amazing
Alexa pull an AJ Lee there 😂
alexa is like a kid hahaha
Drew & Randy Orton fight goes    Alexa at ring corner:🤣🤣🤣🤣
hmmm, you know, roman and bray had a pretty intense feud, maybe, just maybe, the tribal chief and the fiend could lock eyes, and THEN we'd get a feud
How do you like be ambushed all the time Randy Now It's time to Let Him In Champ
What do u mean the fiend and drew McIntyre trapped orton they trying to for a team??
Randy has said he's good at the little things.  His reaction to knowing the Fiend is behind him proves that.  So many emotions in such a small set of movements.
*Alexa says burned the house down*  Me: I understood that reference
"Burned the house down". Its official. Pudding wanna have a snake. And finally, Sister Abigail will have her perfect revenge.
What i can predict now fiend vs randy vs drew. Fiend win and miz will cash in the contract. As usual, fiend title reign will be short again🤦‍♂️ plis dont make it happen
Alexa is amazing... so beautiful and creepy
I honestly don't know what was the point of having the fiend there???😕😕😕
Harley bliss and joker fiend
Walk forwards towards a Scottish Psychopath or walk back towards The Fiend. Talk about being stuck between a rock and a hard place. No good choice either way
Loving evil Bliss 😈
Adding the fiend into the drew and randy storyline is gonna make it way more funner and interesting so I can see a triple threat match coming for wwe championship
The fiend and randy feud will likely be the fiends longest because the fiend has the most of a vendetta against randy because of what randy did the cultist bray, he burnt down the shack that bray I forgot what reason for cared so much for
I’m loving everything about Alexa Bliss right now. The new theme,the creepy laughs and stares literally everything. That line “ After you and Drew BURNED THE HOUSE DOWN” from Alexa to Randy made me start to get goosebumps. Alexa was already consider one of the best women’s champions but now Alexa can be considered one of the best women in WWE because this character she is playing really is solidifying her as one of the best women of all time.
A THREE WAY FUED???!!!!! LIKE THE SHIELD!! IM LOVIN IT
Randy orton
I told yall the fiend was coming and he was on randy head you burned his house down so now its time to pay randy
Randy orton doesn't want to deal with the fiend because Randy Orton is scared so Randy Orton you better watch out for the Fiend
he mess with the undertaker and now the fiend, randy loves to play with demons lol
0:20 AJR burn the house down reference😂.
The Fiend vs The Viper Just Caught My eye
Hype 🔥
I'm on board with all the wwe championship contenders right now. The fiend being added into Drew and Orton's feud is great in my opinion.
Drew and Randy heel/face Twist?
Haha rematch for the wwe title orton vs wyatt.
Awkward moment when the legend killer becomes a legend himself
Bray Wyatt is back, but he's behind Randy Orton. Thinking revenge for burning the cabin of Sister Abigail since 3 years ago. 2:09.  Bray Wyatt (The Fiend): Hello Orton. You will pay for burning Sister Abigail once, but I'm coming for you. 😈.  Randy Orton: 😠.
Under taker vs fiend would be a very good fight!
So is that why alexa was laughing when drew was beating up randy was it part of the fiend and Alexa's plan with drew
I'm not liking the one in the vest, he's an idiot
Can we just agree that The Fiend is one of the best things going on right now in WWE.
alguen sabe cual es la.diferencia entre el cinturon rojo  el azul y este
Can someone please explain to me how randy is the champion but drew won the series 2-1.😕
Triple Threat Match for the WWE Championship?
2:12 randy's reaction just screams "ahhhhhhhhhh shoot i'm screwed"
I bet the Miz will cash in money in the bank... after Randy lost triple threat match.. either The fiend or Drew win but not for long...maybe 10 minute victory...
Go drew go
Does the WWE creative team have a fetish for hurting eyes?
This new attitude from alexa definitely reminds me of Harley Quinn.
The triple threat we don’t want but we need.
Triple threat match at TLC: Orton McIntyre  Fiend
This silly fiend Bray Wyatt thing is so annoying
The Fiend is perhaps the best gimmick right behind The Undertaker
Alexa Bliss is so over now she doesn’t need a championship to be a star.
To be honest if bray and Roman beat randy Orton I’m more likely to get mad Vince is to ruin Randy’s reputation
Alexa bliss is excellent
I’m calling it right now, randy orton vs the fiend in a monster’s ball match, let’s see if those two can handle being locked up in separate dark rooms for 24 hours without food, water, and light
People who watching wwe first are probably like why is Harley Quinn in wwe
If he chose The Fiend, he will turn face. Smart choice, Randy.
The fiend Drew and Randy what a moment
WWE SHOULD HAVE KEPT THE FIEND AND ALEXA ON SMACKDOWN.
Alexa Bliss 😍🥺
Orton vs Drew vs The Fiend and then Miz cashes in imagine👀
Soon as Randy heard the music he’s like: “You know what Drew isn’t all that bad so imma just walk this way..”
The fiend is the best thing in wwe right now, not the tribal chief
The king of mind games being scared of the Fiend... They're really setting this up for something big
Can somebody give me a psn code
Oof Burn the House down I like this
I really wish the Fiend would of gone after Roman. Why WWE, why? 😭
I just Alexa
Alexa look like a 8year old spoiled little brat HAHAHHAHAA
The viper vs the fiend !
I like how they used the burn the house down reference great ending segment especially wit Alexa jus sitting on the top rope laughing her azz off 😂😂😂😂
Triple Threat Match!  Randy Orton vs Drew McIntyre vs The Fiend
One word for bliss…Damm
The Fiend vs Willow would be great tbh
Omg why is Drew getting involved didn’t he lose??
Bray Wyatt 10000% better off  on his own.
I love how orton chose Drew mcintyre to fight when he targeted by the fiend and Drew simultaneously. because, that shows Randy is scared of the fiend more than former WWE champion.
He's here !!
As a Bray fan since 2013 when he first became Bray Wyatt, I love how far he has evolved and is now in some of the best storylines I have ever seen
I am from Indonesia🇮🇩
I see Orton vs Mcintyre vs The Fiend in a triple threat TLC Match for the WWE Title at TLC or they just tease a Orton vs The Fiend WWE Title feud maybe for WM 37, he want his revenge
Damn I'm early
First😂😂
The Fiend vs Randy Orton for the WWE Championship! You have my attention WWE!
The Fiend keeps getting better and better 👌
Let’s go Fiend!
i think roman reings is gonna win and randy orton does not even stand a chance of the tribal chief
Orton: "And there it is, burned the house down ha...."     Edit: Keep liking my comment here and tnx! Coz you will never forget it....
I would’ve removed sins if Alexa was actually in her ring gear, picked up Orton and slammed him down with an F5. That pathetic douchebag snake makes me wanna burn my eyes. And those side plates on that WWE World Heavyweight Championship are hideous.
*Alexa looking like a creepy child doll that only turns on when you aren't looking.......*
That's the only way Nicki she have Alexa back She kisses her and got her back wake her up tag team partner friend and I ask yes, do you think it happens. yes or no
2:20 Randy’s life just flashed before his eyes 😂
When i told u the fiend never forgets what randy did at mania and he comes after him, everybody in the comment section laught..
It’s kinda weird seeing Alexa and Randy in the ring together
*Randy still traumatized from Taker he knew not to go for The Fiend*
The Fiend is the Greatest Character of all time!!!!
Randy Orton was so scared of the fiend that he didn’t even look behind him. 🤣😂
Alexa so cute!
Alexa Reminded me of a Crazy Anime Chick
Did you guys see Drew McIntyre stab Randy Orton in the eye with a pen who does he think he is Seth Rollins
Match card at WWE Survivor Series: -The 30 Years Anniversary of the Deadman: Undertaker -Lashley(c) vs. Zayn(c) in a Champion vs. Champion match -New Day(c) vs. Street Profits(c) in a Champion vs. Champion match -Asuka(c) vs. Banks(c) in a Champion vs. Champion match -Orton(c) vs. Reigns(c) in a Champion vs. Champion match
No one:  My brain at the end of this segment: When did they set the announcer’s desk back up?
The Fiend: Very well Randy. I’ll bide my time.
I love wwe
Hello where are the spanish speakers? 😏😏
Underwhelming ending. The Fiend did nothing.   Alexa was the best part of the segment. Played her role so good and was super cute & sexy.
Drew Mcintyre vs Randy Orton vs The Fiend, for the WWE CHAMPIONSHIP.
First
Alexa's theme though - Spiteful's remix. Also her acting - She's killing in that role
Girly Alexa Bliss is hot as f.
Mctyre next champ
Lindos 😍
