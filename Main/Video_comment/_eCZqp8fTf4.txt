Congrats to Arcangelo! 🏆
Scott wehand Asutral.❤
FELICITACIONES Y QUE DIOS NOS BENDIGA A TODOS!!!🎉
the fight for second with those 4 Horses was crazy!  watch it and imagine Arcangelo out of it at the end 😬
Rewatching this, I can't believe how bad Fox did with this audio. I know they're not a horse racing network but it's as if they've never covered sports in general.
❤❤❤❤❤
2:27 You can see the blue and white Secretariat pole, this marks 31 lengths, his incredible 253 feet 2 inch margin of victory in the 73 race.
1:12
Forte, super horse!
The Unbridled Sire Line is Phenomenal. If Arrogate lived longer he wouldve replicated his Grandsire's record of siring a winner of all three American Classic races.
Im gearing up i saw my pedrigrees so i am ready to go

Watching this back a year later i dont know how they got the audio so badly. Doesn't Fox produce live sports...for a living?   Thankfully they learned their lesson and got it right this year.
Winning time 2: 29:23. Secretariat's 1973 time 2:24:00. "that is a record that  may stand forever" Chick Anderson, caller of the race.
The audio was fine for me. Maybe it was your speakers?
2:27 the Secretariat pole 😍
Despite the sloppy audio…the Belmont Stakes is the first and only Triple Crown race to have aired on _all four networks_ (CBS, ABC, NBC, and now Fox).
i was there ,ufff what a experience of the life time 💙
Gjghtjtjgjtjtm🎉hfhfh❤hjgjgngjgjjhgjmhjjghhjjjhjughjtjhjjj
I love all of arrogates offspring, but seeing forte work so hard and not get it made me mad.
Not only the best thing was the race, it was the return of Tom durkin
So great to see a woman trainer to make history with her horse also give credit to the jockey!
I can't believe that they still call it the Belmont stake! The reason it was called this was because this evil man didn't whip his slaves, but he burned them "at the stake". That's why he called it this. It's a evil racist inside joke. W.p are evil AF
আমি খুব গোঁড়া কে
No Secretariat
I am so glad for the lady trainer, she so deserve to win with her horse and the rider . God bless them !
First woman?? Ever?? Wonder why....
Masters in whipping horses. Great sport 😢
One of the greatest rides ever. Doesn’t get out great so he goes right to the rail. Then he can tell the horse wants to go so he moves out and then back to the rail. Such an underrated ride. And the horse even drifted in the stretch and he’s hits him with the right whip and u can see the moment he does that the horse gets a final burst wow
You can see how National Treasure tried to do the same move they did in the Preakness but the Belmont is longer which caused him to burn out before the end which let Archangelo, who had remained in the middle of the pack throughout the race, to come up from behind using the energy they had built up whilst poor Nationsl Treasure was left in the dust.
Arcangelo is a very good horse, but Forte will get his revenge in the Travers. 😃👍
National treasure in the Travers 8-1 trust me.   $$$$$
this year too slow. i could bring a better filly
🕎🇮🇱.   Thats  all. Thx yo THE. LORD. JESUSCHRIST.     🏆
The only benefit on the winner is that it won a precious race there. Jockey and the horse did great there , they could handle the track. Now for the next race. This horse is just taking a spot.  Forte is no horse to play around with.
Did they ever determine who had the open mic that totally ruined the coverage during the race?
We watched this like 10 times. You must be 1 heck of a horse to put in that much work. Not to mention the the whole team! Congratulations ❤️
I feel so bad for Forte. I wanted him to win, but the number 8 horse boxed him in, costing Forte the victory. Still, 2nd place is stupid impressive, so nice. You did your best Forte, you did your best. Congrats Arcangelo.
I hate how the riders beat the horses.
NJ
Foxsport video quality is trash  NBC > Foxsport
Ser jinete es lo maximo
Yo fui jinete
等比赛结束后才发言的叫废话，在比赛前预测谁能获得胜利才是最重要的，我喜欢赌马，但经常输。
Brilliant day for all young girls who dream at being a trainer in the sport of kings❤
Heck of a race.
I bet you that the next time Arcangleo faces Forte, he's going to be beaten, and the next race is the Breeders Cup classic!!
Why am I listening to canned hoofbeats over one of the most iconic voices in sports calling?
I just want to know why, they didn't let Forte go, they always let him go way outside, when you let a horse go outside 6 wide you're done, but Forte was coming like a rocket, I blame the trainer, and the Jockey!! but that's cool for Breeders cup Forte is going to win!! because no other horse can run 6 wide and win!!
The FOX audio for this race was horrible.
Too bad Tapit Trice had to run a mile and a half further than every other horse in this race.  Ran the entire final turn about 10 yards from the rail.
CASTELLANO ¡ FROM CASTILLA (  S P A I N  )
If you’ve ever been to Belmont those turns seem endless. It takes a great horse and the perfect trip to win that race.
🎉❤Congratulations- Jenna/Genna! I very nearly married into your family, forever dear .. imagine my surprise wondering why the hair was alike mine, the honesty flowing, true emotional response..our families already intertwined so much..my gramie's  horse was sired by Seabiscuit, or Secretariat. My esses do become cartoon quest, tsh phonecall
The belmont stakes should go back to NBC
NBC was better
The emotions from Jenna Antonucci when her horse won was heartfelt, literally. Congratulations
Why is the audio incomprehensible?
First female trainer to win the belmont
Clearly FORTE was going to be the champion  !! I think he didn't have a good race Ortiz was trying to put him outside and it was in the las 500 that he could have a better look but wow after all against this horse wow he is a true Champ.
why is the commentrary audio so awful
Arcangelo seems to be an excellent thoroughbred colt. Did everything the jockey asked to beat the others. Castellano drove his horse like a NYC cab driver picking lanes. Really great race.
Missed on tv but now i saw it.👍⭐️
"Never give up, and if you can't find a seat at a table, make your own table"
FOX Sports is not going to do Horse Racing anymore and also when Tom Durkin said he was retiring when actually he was fired and was working for FOX now because that sounds like Durkin called the race!
Absolutely... the audio was the worst I have ever heard and Tom Durkin is awesome and u can barely hear him... fox dropped the ball on this big time.
Great ride,  doesn't win without the rail trip.
that is one tough horse.  the deal of the century for ebbert.  arcangelo bought at a yearling sale for $35,000.  the son of the great arrogate who has passed on.
Praise God's annoited<><
Viva Venezuela!!!
ang tapang ng kabayong nanalo natabunan pa yung de boca tingin ko nagulangan pa ( the distance was too close for zigzagging ride ) panay preno ni Javier Castellano di malaman ni John VELASQUEZ kung saan sasara it's the HORSES GAME mura pa sa laban yung nanalo parang binata baga sa tao anak ako ni ARROGATE ( DUBAI WORLD CUP tripple A taas ng GRADE the named after arkanghel ) umatras sa laban ng malampasan si NATIONAL TREASURE by this time THE TRICK didn't CLICK i mean the RIDING PATTERN of JOHN binibitbit na lang gracias amigos
Can't even hear the commentator.  Where's Larry?
Textbook ride by the jock. That's how you save a horse till the end and make your move at the right moment.
Garbage
Needs British commentators calling them home
Awesome sound mixing, Fox. Couldn't hear Durkin's call at all.
RIP all the foals and horses that sacrificed their lives to make this race happen 💗
Awesome horse….he’s beautiful….congrats to all, especially to Arcangelol, what a race ….HIGH 5…👍❤️🙏🏼
You put up the race AND DIDN'T REVEAL THE WINNER. Well done FOX Sports, other broadcasters don't understand this concept 👏👏👏
They focused more on horse gallop than the actual race call. Cmon Fox. Let the Americas days the races crew do the show. They already do it every day.
Honor to Jesus! Well done little human. Well done!
Did not like how Ortiz kept forte outside,he had room to follow arcangelo inside to save ground but never did,tough to make up all that ground he lost!
The Belmont is a long race and favors "routers", or distance horses. National Treasure was not going to win this by trying to wire the field.
Never,  ever put your horse out in front at the beginning of a horse race! They can't keep up the speed and power needed to complete the race properly. Even Secretariat was never started that way, but was allowed to run his own race and was moved up from behind to the win.
Castellano 🇻🇪🇻🇪🇻🇪🇻🇪🇻🇪🇻🇪
Meh, good enough to lose to Secretariat by about 40 lengths.
Very steerable horse, not always the case in a thoroughbred.  And gutsy to go up a slim opening on the rail, where it could have gotten squeezed by the leader (but didn't -- kudos to that rider too).
I think Baffert would not be too happy about the quality of the ride John Velasquez gave his mount this race.
Wow. Lovely ride. Well done.!
Javier Catellano again! Congrats paisano Good for you and Family
If every body SEE this repetición SEE all the jockey let pass castellano and the strong horse of the race forte far in the stretch can You belived that bulshiet a don't belived  that bravo for the  organized of race horse tramposos one horse the only Victory got it with 1.52 in mile1/8 jajajaja shame of this
Never but never that horse win this horse again Made the race to castellano for hall of. Fáme
I’m sure we will find out later the horse was on roids
Durkin is a wonderful historical voice for horse racing but he can't be the option for a triple crown race anymore. Fox couldnt get Collmus? NBC own him or something? Hopefully better next year.
Ok, now go make me a sandwich
I handicapped this race on Monday. Watched a bunch of YouTube videos of past performances. When I was finished, my notes left one horse to win it. And that was Arcangelo. I was rather surprised. Who is this horse? But i never deviate from what my process tells me. So on Monday, i placed a nice bet on him. It was a great day for me!!!!! Hey, my process has been wrong now and then.  In 1973, my money was on Sham! 😂 At least this year, I got it right!
3min 0second mark. what did she say?!?!
easy way to set up a horse race is to run good horses wide while a lesser horse comes up the rail classic stiff job watch the replay of this race and the replay of mind that bird winning the derby prove me wrong
Fantastic race, one of the greatest!
Forte will destroy Arcangelo if they meet in theTravers Stakes at Saratoga guaranteed
Forte Ran a HECK of a Race Going 12F Never Been Further Than 1 1/8th and Coming off Minor Foot Issue...He Made up a Lot of Ground to Come and Get 2nd Outfinishing Some Very Good Distance Bred Horses...Lets Not Count Him Out
What’s up with the audio.? I couldn’t even hear the call of the race. Somebody at Fox should be awfully embarrassed.  That audio was terrible!
What's up with the call of the race ? Very lame
Keep horse racing coverage to NBC pls 😂
R.I.P. Arrogate (2-Jun-23).  Gone, but never forgotten. Your son, Arcangelo, did you proud today.
Secretariat would have smoked this field once again.
Great ride by the best Venezuelan jockey ever, Javier Castellano...
Terrible, terrible sound. Typical Fox Sports screwing everything up. Same thing happens during their sporting football and baseball. The sound team and all these events are tremendously terrible! 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Jenna  build your team awesome  🐎
SECRETARIAT!
Tom Durkin's voice is shot.  Literally anyone else would have been better.
Winning time of 2:29.23. Secretariat wins this race by 30+ lengths
Arcangelo! Yes!!! Prophetic!
Awesome race
Congratulations on a great win
Just watched this for the 1st time and I was saying throughout the backstretch the 3 had a lot of horse. Gotta give it to the rider. He was patient and the inside opened up for him. Once it opened, it was clearly over.
Hey folks, the HORSE did all of the work ,not the jockey or the trainer or the owner. The HORSE did all of the running.
🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
What a team!!! Congratulations seeing her break down in joy… made me cry…chills
This race was rigged all the way.
Fox needs to get out of our sport, their sound mix was terrible and some of their crewmembers had never watched a race before.
Horrible audio! Where was Larry Collmus? He was missed
Noticeably 50 years after Secretariat made history, a woman trainer made history as well. Hard work always pays off. Well done, team Arcangelo!!!
SO GLAD JAVIER BACK ON TOP OF HIS GAME...SO HAPPY FOR JAVIER & THE HORSE ❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉❤CONGRATULATIONS TO THE LADY TRAINER ALSO
What a Horrible race by the Jockey of Forte... He lost position and was left with Nothing More to do than to run on the Outside
Stop horse racing. It’s animals abuse.
Muy buen programa y sobre todo la pregunta ya que los 3 son buenos ejemplares en excepción mage ya que en su segunda presentación y trayendo un avance hace un extrañó el cual saca a cualquier jockey de su plan he incluso quita tiempo valioso pero los críticos no profundizan ni ven los contra tiempo y javier castellanos es un jockey con una gran humildad y lo demostró con arcangelo que vino preparado tanto física como mentalmente vino a lo que vino a correr felicitaciones a su entrenadora y con una gran condución bueno sedio lo que se vivió y no se podía esperar mas tremenda carrera

I needed that happiness
Congratulations 🙏♥️
50 years ago seems like last month. My God.
Javier with a perfect ride. HE WON THAT RACE.   If Tapit Trice gets the rail skimming ride, he would have won
Fresh quality horse  and a great ride by JC mon
Seems like Gray horses win.
I forgot all about the triple crown, but to be honest, since Secretariat, I haven't been interested anymore! Why was this race history, big deal, a female trainer! I don't care and I'm a female!
Arcangelo,  L' emporte.  Mais, Dieu,  Qu' il est Mal Monté.  YVES SAINT MARTIN,  L' Aurait emporté.  De 25 LONGUEURS,
Probably had Penny Chenery by cheering right by her side.
Horse murdering Criminal's! Jesus will get you all!❤❤🙏🙏
2:29.23  The GOAT 2.24.00   That is about 25 lengths difference.
Hope you keep winning Arcangelo. Years back my brother did work with her as a groom when she only had few horses running at Gulfstream  and Belmont...i meet Jena once at Belmont and did never imagine that one day she will win   the Belmont Stake cause she only has cheap horses in her care...happy for you Jena.
What is going on with this audio?
Congratulations to the Jockey and Arcangelo!!
...really miss Larry Collmus on the call as opposed to the pre-pubescent voice-cracking of whomever that was.
Horrible audio by Fox, and Tom Durkin was good back in his days, but he lost his voice way too many times in the home stretch. Durkin should have announced  another race earlier on the card. You can watch the NBC version with Larry Collmus, and its much better. Congrats to Javy, for an amazing  ride, and first ever women to win the Belmont for trainer Jena.
Balapan kuda.
A great race💕💕💕💕
Why do networks force things down our throats. NBC does the same thing. Curt does football. I felt bad for the guy. He continually had to say. I know nothing about horse racing. They have people like Greg wolf and lafitt pincay. I know they used them on the undercard. Keep them on the broadcast. NBC has the TVG crew they can use and don’t. Yeah, they will use the ladies cause they look good but that’s it. They have a seasoned crew and don’t use them. Gary stevens and Tom Amoss are fine but when you put them with a novice it doesn’t flow. It’s just bad TV.
Please no more Mike Smith  commentary  he can't do it  any jockey that gets the horses he gets to ride would do just as good or better if zenyatta  wasn't  great  she would be  15 and  5  with the rides he gave  her
Great Race !!
I bet the 18 horse from Schenectady.
2 Famous Firsts in the Belmont.Javier Castellano, Jockey and Jena A 1st Female Trainer Incredible!!
Sound engineers must have took the night off ?
Track announcer: Tom Durkin
Grazie Signora Antonucci e grazie Arcangelo e Javier Castellano from Venice (ITALY)
5.2 seconds behind secretariat...50 years later and no horse has come close
Unless there is an extraordinary horse who won the Derby and or the Preakness, "fresh legs" usually takes the Belmont.
Why did National Treasure fall back like that. If I had to take a guess I'd say that horse was sick with colic and they raced him anyway.

I've got an idea, quit hurting these horses, then having to trajically put them down......they deserve a long life, not over trained Wake up
It was a good race and I congratulate the winners by it was SLOW. It's as if they don’t really start racing until the stretch. 50 years ago, the winning time was 2.24 flat. Over 5 seconds faster than this year.  I think it would be a good bet to say Secretariat's record in the Belmont will never be beaten.
Looks like she's a..woman too...good for her
visually, fox you have great graphics. audio. it sounds like someone took a mic and shoved it   up their nose and then ran a mile and a half that way. 💀
1:37 Someone was sharpening knives in the announcer's booth apparently.
Forte will destroy this horse next time.
Was the great Tom Durkin calling the race??!
Good for you Jena!
the worst broadcast and hosts for a race [ except for maggie ] had to use the mute button often
Horrible to watch with that audio. I hope the live feed on fox was ok
I gotta say I miss Larry Collums. He’s the best horse race commentator of all time
Yes the audio SUCKS! But some contexts: each second is equal to 6 horse lengths. So this horse was 5:23 seconds slower than Secretariat's winning time of 2:24 flat. That comes to 32 lengths. So the 2023 Belmont Stakes champion loses to Secretariat by 32+ lengths. Secretariat's record will never be broken at least whats left of my life. I was 14 when he destroyed the field in 1973. I'll never forget that race OMG. He ran every split faster then the one before. Unheard of in horse racing.  2023 Belmont race all the horse ran their last split as their slowest split.  God Bless Secretariat! ❤
We want larry colmus
Beautiful Animal. Steel Grey. Great ride.
Terrible sound
I switched my bet from Angel to Tapit Trice and 10 minutes before the race to Arcangelo, because Fox played a short interview with Jena Antonucci. She described the horse's mood as, "Get out of my way!" and that's a true indication of a heart to win. There are a few horses who just can't stand anyone ahead. She was very gleeful - she KNEW he would fight. Switch bet!
Whoever was mixing the audio at Fox needed to be fired on the spot.
Great ride by the winner! Fox networks SUCKS! Everyone involved in that sh-t showed should be fired including Smith! Give me a break!
I ain’t gonna lie fox needs to stick to football and let NBC stick to the triple crown races I miss hearing Larry Collmus saying and there into stretch.And his call when American pharaoh won the triple crown when he said here it is the 36yr trout is over man nothing less than amazing😁😁😁💯✅
The race was won because Archangelo had enough gears & enough gas in the tank. You can tell by the way he was running they weren't going to catch him.
That number six jockey timed it late if not he would of won.
Why is the thumbnail Cody’s Wish winning the Met Mile?
Never get old!" Fantastic race
Great race. Congratulations to the connections.
Was that Pat Day riding Forte? Whoever the jockey was on Forte  did a great impersonation of a Day late and a dollar short.
We need real people to do the subtitles!!
Good. Horses like women better than men.
Great race 😊
Great race! So happy for the trainer & jockey.
🇻🇪🇻🇪🇻🇪🇻🇪 solo Venezuela 🇻🇪🙏 gracias a Dios
The audio quality on this video is abysmal.  Does FOX Sports not have an audio engineer?
No matter the distance of time, Secretariat is still remembered after so many years and will still continue to be remembered for many more to come. That's the impact the race of 1973 had on the world of racing.
This was a wonderful race. However the greatest race ever was Secretariat at the belmont. Never again will this race be amazing.
forte's jokey very very very bad driver
What an exciting race!
Secretariat does hold the record for 1.5 miles at 2:24, it's not a world record , as a horse named Twighlight Eclipse ran it in 2:22 at the Pan American Stakes, in March 23/2013. Difference was that Secretariat ran on dirt, and Twighlight Express ran it on turf, but 2 blazing fast times.  Also I believe AP Indy ( Seattle Slew's son) ran it in 2:26, as well as Easy Goer in 2:26, in 1989. Really a horse that didn't do much else actually has the fastest time ever in the 1 .5 mile, is Twightlight Eclipse. You can google this and see the race, like I did. Secretariat was a beast though, and probably could have shaved off a couple seconds if pushed.   The Pan American Stakes was run in 2013, at Santa Anita Park.
A great race on the 50th Anniversary of the Great Secretariats incredible win.
Why was FOX’s audio so awful all day? The race calls were inaudible.
Am I the only one that cried watching her celebration as her horse took the lead??
Which horse got euthanized after the race
Javier (Mage) now this race no Mage but Javier on a far inferior horse??? He shouldn’t of been in the race imo!?!
Blame that one on Forte jockey.He had plenty of gas in the tank and he held off too long
How can I find out what a 5$ to win ticket will pay for the Belmont winner? Thank you to anyone that can help 🙏
its fixed
Jenna’s reaction was one of the purest emotional reactions to winning something you didn’t think was attainable
Javier Castellano is one of the best jockeys in the horse racing world.  Congratulations to the entire team!
I don’t really remember turning into a horse and running a race, but I’m overwhelmed by the support from everybody and I look to continue chasing the majestic triple crown.
All a set up people I know how it all goes All of a sudden first female trainer. It's all money
Great ride, the winning move actually occurs going into the first turn. He takes his position just behind the frontrunner. He had to snap it off in the other horse going into the turn allowing him to gain that position. From there he just followed the leader until turning for home. JV was watching for Forte and Ortiz Jr along with Tapit Trice over his right shoulder. That’s when Javier gave his mount a few pumps and it was over, Arcangelo took position and then ran on to win. I’m so glad Ortiz didn’t win any of the 3 legs this year. While he is an excellent rider, he has no morals when it comes to winning. He is an extremely dirty dirty rider.
😮
Come on Fox!! You bring the GOAT Tom Durkin out of retirement then do such a terrible job with the sound you can’t even hear him. 🤦‍♂️
Knew forte couldn’t do it
Are they gonna post Tom dunkin other calls, eager to listen to what he said about Cody wish. Seeing how fox produced the Belmont I think I rathered of had Larry announcing but eager to here his other calls.
Was that Tom Durkin on the call? Certainly sounded like him. Did they just bring him back for the One?
And another horse dies now at Belmont after the race, they need to stop this.
congratulations  Jena¡¡  and arcangelo¡¡¡¡¡¡¡
What a Great Race: But to My POV the  Finish was "iffy" there for a Moment. Where the Other Three Horses?  Looked to be Driving for Arcangelo some. Especially After Javier brought His Horse 🐴🐎 Up on the Inside along the Rail. Then  Once They'd  gotten by Natl. Treasure His Move a little to the Outside of the Track? Seemed to Help Thier Stretch Run & Last Surge? As a Moment before that, He looked like He lost Some Ground for a Split Second or So.          IN My Opinion & just Watching this Highlights Reel. The Race was a Clean Start for all Eight Horse's 🐴🐎and Clean through, until about A Mile of it was Over?  Then Watching the Rerun, Closely for Three Times?             Once they Completed that  Clubhouse Turn, I Saw an Awful lot of Tight Riding Going On. As they Ran from the "Top" of that Stretch too The Finish Line. My Point Here is? Were there Any Inquiries, Fouls or  Complaints Lodged Before The  Official Results, were Posted.          In My POV,  I Have No Question's about ARCANGELO Being the Outright Winner 🏆🏆 of the Race. As He & His Jockey Ran a Bueatiful Race, from Start to Finish. My Point is that the Other's, were quite Visibly Involved in a lot of "Jostling", and Bumping, Happening in that Last Oh 1/4 Mile to the End? Otherwise it was a Great Race Overall. I Hope I haven't Offended Anyone, With My POV, or by Voicing My Thoughts 🤔🤔 About the Previous Clip's of the Race. In Closing these Comments. IT was a Fantastic Race, with a StoryBook Ending that was Almost Miraculous too Retell Unless A Person See's it for Themselves. So I'll Say Thank for Sharing The Great Highlights With Me. And May The Good Lord Bless US All. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Amazing ride Javi and a game move by Arcangelo!
Which horse had to be euthanized
Congratulations Jena! Well deserved. I wish they did  a better job with the audio. I couldn't here Tom Durkin hardly at all. Please go back to NBC. They are the network for horse racing.
Amazing triumph!
What a masterful ride Javi! He pushed the horse at the beginning of the trail, just to have it where he wanted to be at. Waiting until the end to move it away from the inside, to be able to hit this horse and give the rest! Once again everything he did on this race, it’s just remarkable! Congrats to the trainer, and the people involved. Such a great performance also for Forte and Irad. This shows how hard is to win at these levels.
Come on Fox, fix the audio! It was horrible all day!
If some beat you with a whip you would run fast too. This is a sick sport. That rider was beating that horse hard. Poor animal.😢
Such a beautiful horse..a champ just like his sire Arogate ❤ Congratulations to all 🏆
This is the race the industry worries about the most probably. The distance is something a lot of American horses struggle with unlike their foreign counterparts.
Having Arcangelo win the Belmont and Secret Oath win the Oaks last year, it really makes me wonder what kind of sire Arrogate would've been in 2-3 years time had he not passed away. Makes it sad that this year's crop of 2 year olds is gonna be final crop from Arrogate. He's turning into a great sire
Congratulations Arcângelo and his connections.  The Belmont with Larry Collmus narrating is more exciting.
Congrats to Jena and her team - I mostly had Angel of Empire at the top of my tickets, but inituition called, and I put a 10/10 win/place bet on Arcangelo. So glad that I did - my 20.00 brang me 125.00 - paying for my losses and buying a round of beers at my local track.
Javi wasnt on Secretariat by a long shot
Too bad I missed it, had no idea Fox televised it.
Got teary, hearing Tom Durkin who I used to enjoy so much, I live a half hour from Sarataga racetrack and then wonderful, incredible win by Arcangelo!!!
Thanks for the criminal ride on Forte Irad,once again you checked him three times.This is why the industry struggles because of inept riding,and trainers like Baffert.
The jockey atop of Forte should be horse whipped. He had a ton of horse left and didn’t pull the trigger until it was too late. A 10 for Forte for the closing effort and a zero for his jockey. Almost makes you believe he threw race?
As this unfolded live I couldn't hear a word from Tom Durkin.
EL MEJOR JINETE DEL MUNDO PAPA DE DONDE DE VENEZUELA.... DUELALE A QUIEN LE DUELA... 2 PASOS DE LA TRIPLE CORONA PARA CASTELLANO MUCHO...
Hats Off to Johnny V for opening up the rail in defeat
Great to hear during voice of triple crown in 2024???
Was the audio this bad in real time? Whats with the rasping???
Forte and Tapit Trice also good horses, great heart!  Arcangelo, very well trained, congratulations to all team, with the direction of  outstanding Jena.
Thank you for giving the Lord Jesus Christ the glory at 5:00, Javier.  May He bless you as you press on...
Excellent and intelligent ride, a great Team!
What a great race!!!!
Smart race! Well done!
No beetle bomb?
Great, but not like SECRETARIAT  ... THAT WAS A DIFFERENT SPEED.
I was sure he was the number 3 horse, he was calm from the moment he came off the starting gear
Beautiful ride by Javier. National Treasure fell into the same old Belmont trap, asked to go too early. Way too early.
You think they’d being crying if money wasn’t involved? Lol
Lo apuró a TT
Congratulations to Javier and Arcangelo!!! A race well run. And the legendary TOM DURKIN called the race!!! 😃😃😃 🏇🏇🏇 Nice surprise!
Tom Durkin back?
A great ace and an outstanding champion.  Whoever was in charge of the sound mix should be fired. I didn't get to watch the race live, was the track announcer drowned out by the natural sounds on the live broadcast, or was it just on this YouTube video. Leave it to Fox Sports to think folks would rather hear the heavy breathing of a jockey than the guy calling the race.
Tom Durkin is the Vin Scully of Thoroughbred racing.
Congratulations to Arcangelo, Jena, Javier and the connections on their historic Belmont win!
Javier Castellano (period)
I believe the trainer willed the horse with her energy to win that race, incredible victory
Commentator sounds like  he was crying when  they reach the  final  8 of a mile,maybe  his  expectation was dash as a commentator you can't approach it with  a mindset,i could hardly make out his words.
Tom Durkin unintelligibly croaking and screaming his way off a nine-year layoff. Why are we meant to suffer like this?
Great ride JC. BTW the Producers in Fox couldn't turn down the volume on the horses but drowned out the Track announcer instead?
Congratulations to the winning team!
What an excellent ride!! Well done All
terrible call
Hard work does pay off. And tonight's celebration will be well deserved. 🎉😢
Another horse has died. You bet, they die. The humans who support this cruelty are losers.
Arcangelo squeezing onto the inside rail out of the final turn, coming down the front & then stride for stride with National Treasure down the stretch made for an exciting race, National Treasure simply faded, well done Javier & Jena 🙌
#6 got a bad trip.  #6 could have won just settling along the rail behind 3 or 4  in entire final turn.  Who was the rider on 6 ?
When a horse wins a G1 after pulling so hard for so long, you have to take notice. Horse had every right to fade in the straight hut, instead, found a turn of foot to scoot clear and get home in front with sheer guts and will to win because petrol had to be low. Shades of Sea The Stars in the Arc. Remarkable.
Give the rights back to NBC.
I handicapped this race on Monday. Watched a bunch of YouTube videos of past performances. When I was finished, my notes left one horse to win it. And that was Arcangelo. I was rather surprised. Who is this horse? But i never deviate from what my process tells me. So on Monday, i placed a nice bet on him. It was a great day for me!!!!! Hey, my process has been wrong now and then.  In 1973, my money was on Sham! 😂 At least this year, I got it right!
Very bad commentary , we need Tom back for triple crown
forte ran like a short horse stamina wise...oh well. congrats to Jena Antonucci and Archangelo's connections
Pretty obvious these horses give extra for Javi. Going inside was a pro move, a winning move.
Well the other horses came just a little bit too late. Definitely had just enough to hang on. Hard to believe it's the first woman to win this race I mean women been training horses for 100 years it's kind of weird
The flat spot that Forte hits in recent races is killing him.
Congrats Javier you deserve it my Jockey, still one of the best. Great job Jena 💯
720?
CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!
Forte is a quality horse but     hits flat spots in his races ? The winner travelled well, got up the inside rail, and was a worthy winner. 🏆
This finish he lost... his voice 😅!
Kudos to Fox for bringing Tom Durkin out of retirement. An artist of a race caller. I wish the crowd/track noise wasn’t so loud, though, so you could hear his call better…
I could hardly hear the call, I think Fox really did a bad job overall. Great ride by the Jockey.
I love the honor guard of mounted police officers at the finish line.
"Arcangelo" no doubt will win if you watch how the horse move in the half , but the rider still manage to wait till home stretch to win the belmont.
Congrats to Arcangelo connection! John V. left the door wide open and that's how this race was won! Lucky me,I bet Tapit Trice to show.
Congrats to Javier Castellano for a masterful ride - and for winning 2 of the 3 Triple Crown races!  And to Jena Antonucci for making history. Training job par excellence. Arcangelo won it fair and square, no excuses for the higher profile horses.
I DON'T KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE THIS WAS JUST ANOTHER ALLOWANCE RACE. MAYBE CAUSE SINCE I SAW SECRETARIAT, SEATTLE SLEW, AFFIRMED AND ALL THE REST OF THE GREAT HORSES I EXPECT THE SAME EACH YEAR...BUT NIL...ZERO. MAYBE THAT THAT'S IT AND WE'LL NEVER HAVE A SUPER STAR ANYMORE...
So happy for trainer, jockey, and horse. A beautiful moment in this sport.
Impressive!!!🎉
What an awesome finish congrats to all!
Wow, did u see the tears of joy by Jenna the trainer that won the 2023 Belmont. Probably the BIGGEST win of her career that will put her services in more demand, and more $$$ MONEY no doubt. Good for her, she seems like a great human being 😊
BOY I HOPE WHEN I DIE I STOP HEARING WOMEN MAKING HISTORY BEING THE FIRST WOMAN FOR THIS FOR THAT...SINCE I WAS A KID I'VE HEARD IT. WELL THEY ARE HUMAN...THEY ARE TRAINED BY MEN...LIKE I USED TO FOLLOW AN ANTONNUCI IN THE L.A. HERALD EXAMINER SPORTS SECTION. HE WAS A HANDICAPPER AND I LOVED HIS SHORT COMMENTS...LIKE A LONGHSHOT HE LIKED HE'D WRITE "SPOT FOR THE ACTION." NOW THIS LADY WITH THE SAME ANTONNUCI NAME MAYBE PART OF HIS FAMILY.
Belmonts the best
Good dose on the 3. Had him since Thurs.
I picked him to win.. I loved his sire..
So happy for her she was so excited I love her passion!  Congrats!
Great horse
Javier castellano the best de Venezuela
Jorge Chavez gets busy on Monarcos. Point Given not today! Best announcer ever in my book. So long Mr Durkin!
viva chucho castellano nojodaaaaa
Forte faced the deep unknown up in distance plus had to compete off of a 3month layoff. Horse shaped like he would get further but he was ridden today like he was gonna absolutely blast clear. But one thing with that tactic assuming is different from doing.  Can't give a lead like that in a prestigious race big ups and congratulations to the winner. But take three things out of this race. empire failed to give it's best the day and forte got going far too late. And the winner has improved massively?? So far I think it was two under performances from the two other horses mentioned. However I take nothing away from the winner best horse won on the day.
Great race! Go Arcangelo!
Congrats Jenna !!
rich people YEAH ✊ Horse racing YEAH ✊ rich people, Horse racing YEAH ✊ YEAH ✊ YEAH ✊                 😈😈😈
Javvy had the 🐎 And, I knew it!
congratulations team arcangelo
Great race. Congrats to Jena on the win! Welcome back to race calling, Tom Durkin. Suggestion for Fox...have the volume on the jockeys mics turned down until after the race. The audio was rough at times.
People are dissing the Fox broadcast and the audio was awful but I didn't hear anything about fashion which is my most hated part of the NBC broadcast so I consider that a good start for them.
The audio balance was AWFUL. Couldn't hear Tom Durkin's call of the race.
The sound on the TV broadcast that you couldn't hear the call. Fox never listed the order of finish. Fox taking over really stunk.
Great job Jena Antonucci, National Treasure, Arcangelo!  ❤❤❤
Exciting race!
Lousy coverage. Poor quality audio. I could barely hear the race announcer.  It was a great race!
Feel very happy for Jena. she's an awesome woman and trainer...no cheating involved...love the emotion
So happy for the whole team, and that an Arrogate baby took a TC race!
Even though Lucian trained Secretariat, Penny was the first woman. Cmon now
Legendary Tom Durkin with the call..sounded like his voice cracked a few times lol... honestly couldn't even hear him towards the end... still Legendary!!
Woohooo finally $$$$.. my “longshot” bet ARCANGELO!!! Congratulations JC!
The Best Belmont Stakes I've seen in a while.  Congrats to Arcangelo and his connections. 🎉
Cheers Jena !
Congrats to all except whoever mixed the audio
Javier just made the right movement when put ahead of Forte, this was the difference.. Castellano shows his big performance
Cashed $445 always bet castellano
Suspicious I say. Great story the liberal media has on this 50th anniversary of the Great Secretariat win at Belmont and the Triple Crown.  I have been watching these horses all year round and you never get the two top horses all year in this race unless it was for a triple crown. And we got 5 of the best 7 horses all year in this race.  And the winning time is 2:29. 23. A slow time on a fast track. Sorry but for me something is not right. The two best horses looked like they were stuck in mud until the last 20 yards to get 2nd.  We seen way too many weird things in now legalized gambling in sports.  And we know this liberal media loves a good liberal minded story.
Good race, but man the audio sucks.
Nice white noise in the background....
Send this race back to NBC . WORST CAMERA ANGLES AND TRACK ANNOUNCER EVER. WAY TO MUCH STATIC IN THE AUDIO AND THE CAMERA ANGLES LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE SLAPPED TOGETHER AT THE LAST MINUTE.
This was the Tapit Stakes.  Tapit Shoes and Tapit Trice father is Tapit.  Hit Show and Arcangelo grandfather is Tapit.
The jockey. Had it all the way.  Lol  number 4 He got    tired he went out to fast.   But the horse is smart and a fast  horse.  the jockey.did the right move hitting the horse and pulling the  horse he went flying
Bruh this audio was beyond dogshit.
Felicitaciones campeón eres el mejor VIVA VENEZUELA
Forte is a champ for a reason. 10 week break and Irad is great but today ehh had him 200 wide . Forte was robbed of a derby (scratched ) and Preakness (dumb 14 day ban). Can’t wait to see him later in summer
That’s what GOD says    So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.
No  que  el mejor  caballo era  forte  y  de  que  llego
First female tc trainer, first belmont win for jockey, got first derby winner also and Johnny v got first preakness...first female president on deck...
If Dave Johnson called this race, we probably won't be able to hear him saying "and down the stretch they come".
2:02 Why does the audio sound like a steam engine train? Are the horses making that sound?
Blue rose silks tells a bigger narrative than 39 years ago Julie Krone made history, 50 years ago secretariat and Jena is 47, 47 previous attemps all failed by female trainers...FEMALE PRESIDENT NEXT 😉......
¡Javier Castellano lo hizo de nuevo! ¡En 2023 ganó el Derby de Kentucky y el Belmont Stakes! ¡Y Jenna Antonucci se convirtió en la primera entrenadora en ganar un "Test de los Campeones" y una carrera de Triple Corona! ¡Felcitaciones a ambos!  Como bien dijo el comentarista de "Fox Sports"Tom Rinaldi; cincuenta años después de Secretariat, hoy se hizo historia. 🙂😁😆😄😃😅😀😊😉😎🤩😆😃😄😀😉😊  Saludos desde Venezuela  Javier Castellano did it again! In 2023 he won both Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes! And Jenna Antonucci became the first female trainer to win a "Test of Champions" and a Triple Crown race! Congratulations for them!  Like Fox Sports commentator Tom Rinaldi said: fifty years after Secretariat, today history was made. 😅😄😀😁😄🙂😊😉😎☺🤗🤭😀😃😄🤓.  Best regards from Venezuela
Worst narrator ever.....
But seriously Fox Sports needs to fire their sound team. Or is the crowd sound that loud in the grandstand that it can override a track announcer's call? I think not as the nyra track announcer could be heard loud and clear. I was especially  tuning in for Durkin's call too
Congratulations very proud of u
Thanks y’all
Thanks 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏👍👍👍👍👍👍🙂🙂🙂😎😎
Awesome victory by Arcangelo. Never count out a Peter Pan victor in the Belmont. Congrats to Jena for the inspirational win. I'll be showing this victory to my daughter. Kudos to her for her humility in crediting the horse and jockey. Great story for the little guy....and gals.
Javier with the veteran Belmont move saving ground taking the rail; going around that final turn, not asking of Arc until the final 1/16th..beautiful
Thanks for the $400 Arcangelo
Congrats to all parties, great job!
Congrats to the team but most of all the horse lots of HEART, Congrats to ALL the HORSES the most NOBLE creature GOD created. And just some quick advice for FOX ask NBC HOW TO BROADCAST HORSE RACING you have alot to learn.
Mage or arcangelo if they can compete together.. which one Javier will ride?
I lose this race with a smile
Congo Rats. Interesting to see Javier learn to ride and be the top poster boy for winning again after his 3 years of absolute horrible ride, after horrible ride. I wonder what the difference is?? First woman trainer to win this race?? Nice to know there could be DEI in " racing". 😂😂😂😂 I wonder if any drugs were involved? Not like we would know, but just saying.
Irad did a good job getting Forte up for 2nd.
Arcangelo was tugging for the first 5 furlongs and just wanted to go...but JC just kept him relaxed and waited for the rail to open then set him loose. Looks just like his Dad... He was always a winner.
That horse hit another gear on the turn leading to the stretch.
End is near , stuff you have never seen will be seen🎉
My family and I was at the race…very loud crowd. Great atmosphere.
Awesome...Finally women will take this too... Awesome.😊
Love the result. Would love to have been able to hear the call. Guess they need to work on their sound mix a little more.
Congratulations to Arcangelo and team! That was a really good race! What great joy for the trainer, being the first woman trainer to win the Stakes! That’s so awesome! And congratulations to the jockey who won his first Belmont Stakes as well ! Such a beautiful horse! They all are beautiful! 😊
Horrible ride on Forte! He could have won.
Great victory...very happy for both jockey & trainer....he thanked God first, couldn't hv said it better.
Javier castallano my favorite jockey had exacta 4 dollar exacta box forte archangel
J.j. Castellano de Venezuela para El MunDo🐴
Congratulations to the Winners.  If ever there was a race to turn Tapit Trice a loose this was it.
Congratulations 🎊 👏 💐 🥳 🏆🏅to Arcangelo!
Could have mentioned Penny Chenery Tweedy being a female owner a little more
Jeez fox what was that audio?
This one looked like a very fast race. 2023: Belmont, Arcangelo wins with a time of  2.29. 1973: Belmont, Secretariat wins with a time of 2.24 The record stays.
Very good patient ride by Javier; made his move at the right time.  Big up to the trainer.
Great Race, but Secretariat could have moonwalked this fast
Love watching her reaction as well as owner and others at the finish. Horse racing is a great sport. These horses are all heart. Arcangelo did his job and will have a nice big meal to top the day off.
Good for the first female trainer to win Belmont 👏👏
I always come to these messages to see how long it takes for some fella to try to sound like they are smart by referencing Secretariat's 31 length win. LOL.  Give it time, these folks always crawl out of the woodwork.
This Fox broadcast was a disaster on just about every level and then to top it off you can't hear Durkin's call at all over the pointless cacophony of hooves on dirt. Turn the nat sound DOWN and the announcer mic UP
Tom Durkin is back in town again. Welcome back, Big Tom.
Otra bendición para nuestra malograda Venezuela, los pequeños hombres, hacen las grandes Hazañas, gracias Castellano, Díos y la Chinita te digan llenando de Bendiciones y mil veces gracias por darnos estas alegrías
FOX presentation not as good as NBCs traditionally is.  Microphone on horses way to powerful, Tom Durkin's microphone too weak.   Cool to see Tom Durkin back.
Little Calvin Borel rail action
Way to go javier
Race Call: Tom Durkin
Give me Wolf, Sterling, Clement, Mig, Mag, & Johnny I , the regular cast and one more thing F***in audio that works.
Tom Durkin welcome back our legend🤠
5 seconds slower than Secretariat in 1973, about 30 lengths behind him.
50 years before another woman trainer would win the Belmont Stakes!!  Congratulations to you, Javier and of course the horse Arcangelo!!
The broadcast was lacking most of the day, Tom had some good call’s especially in Cody’s Wish race but the overall broadcast just felt poor compared to nbc with the Derby n Preakness. Not having Larry calling the race was predictable cause it was fox but still very disappointing. Most of the races called throughout were I’m guessing by the belmonts home announcer , he ain’t bad but you couldn’t really hear any audio on the track, just sounded flat.
National treasure ran out of gas
The first female trainer wins
Well done, All. Great race, great heart on Arcangelo, looked close at first, but he could have held them off another quarter, boy's got a gear.
Should of been on NBC
Sloooooow race.  They all looked done in just past the 3/4 pole
Welcome back Tom durkin
Congrats to 🐎 , jockey , trainer ( you go Girl ! ) owner & me too for betting him ! Very well-bred horse. 👍
What a perfect patient ride.
Greaat Race.  Congrats to Horse Jocky & First Woman Trainer Jenna .  Yahoo!   One Huge Complaint about broudcast sound... was terrible for the whole show. Need More work on that Prior to airing.
And FOX is now broadcasting the Belmont why?
The call-audio for the race was horrible. 👎🏽
Great ride by the Jokey ! Turned him loose at the right time & fortunate to not get bumped by National Treasure on the rail. Now I wish I had bet more $ on him !
Both Javier and the horse were not going to be denied. Horse showed great character and no hesitation. More importantly Great horsewomanship from Jena, congrats to all!
Fox's audio coverage of this race was awful! Booooo
Where are the placing for 6-10?!?
It was great to hear Tom Durkin..!!
Nice move by Javier coming up the rail.
I always bet number three. Congratulations.👍👍
The absolute WORST audio ever by a network that's supposed to be great in sportscasting. I kept waiting for them to notice it and correct it over the THREE-HOUR broadcast, but I guess they were out to lunch. Ridiculous to say the least!!!
Great race! TERRIBLE AUDIO. Fox Sports should be ashamed.
I'm surprised she didn't mention DEI as her formula for winning....
Horrible commentary, atrocious. Terrible footage and horrible audio.
I wish I could have watched this live but I don’t have cable and fck streaming services
Castellano amazing Jokey 🎉from my country Venezuela vamos nojoda de Maracaibo pal Mundo 🌎
This is not a great group of horses! 2:29!
was s good race.  congrats to Arcangelo's team...hats off to javier.. takes guts to squeeze inside.
NYRA on track announcer Johnny had a nice call today.🏇🏻🎙️😁
Forte and Tapit Trice, two of the best horses I watched all year looks like they were running in mud, and then the last 20 yards they run like they were shot out of a cannon.  4 of the best horses I watched this year was in this race. And Hit Show wasn’t too far from them. You would think on a fast track, that one of these top 5 horses I watched could best a 2.29 23/60 time.
Was really looking forward to hearing Durkin call this and could barely hear him :(
The audio for this was terrible. It's great that Tom Durkin came back but it was so hard to hear him. I got bad news, unfortunately FOX will be broadcasting the Belmont Stakes for the next 7 years so they better fix their audio next time.
Congrat
Great race, but could’ve done a better job with the audio. Could barely hear Durkin over the background noise
That was an exciting race for 2nd wow.
Congratulations to Jena, Arcangelo,  and connections.
Congrats to Arcangelo! 🏆
