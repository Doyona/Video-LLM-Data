This may seem random but I grew up in the church and thought that was the whole religion just going to church every Sunday and eventually stopped going and started to do my own thing.  I wanted to find the purpose of life because I knew everything we worked for would pass away.  I was looking at all the religions unbiasedly, looking historically so I wouldn't have blind faith. Later on I had a tug on my heart to open up the Bible and saw the Jesus people talked about was completely different from what was in the Bible.  I started to draw closer to the higher power and had a supernatural encounter with him and I felt his love and peace and was indescribable and overwhelming almost but was out of this world and everything looked brand new like it was the first time seeing it when I looked outside literally.  I wasn't expecting the encounter either and was shocked when it happened. (I don't do drugs or alcohol) His name is Jesus and I’m here to tell you it’s about a relationship not religion and he is real and did die on the cross for you willingly and thinks you as the only person and was thinking of you while dying. You don’t have to believe my experience you can seek yourself, I suggest you start in the minimalistic facts of the resurrection because if the resurrection is false than Christianity is false. All we chase in this life is temporary think about your eternal life.
Man shut ya goffy self up you got beat up at the airport😂😂

Y’all fr tho where do y’all hear notti is dead and edotty is to?.
I get it kids are young and easily influenced following the trend trying to make it out the hood. Just be careful with the company u keep. It's more ways to make money I just pray our heavenly father keeps his hands over every last soul in the vid and the comments. I sincerely pray the Lord will send his angels over his children in the mighty name of Jesus Christ ‼️ God bless everyone in this comment section 🙏🏾 📖 🙏🏾
Miah Kenzo dropped the ball getting out of 41. She would murk these beats and be all on radio too 🤦🏿
Great rendition did soulja some justice

NOTTI IS DEAD AND EDOTTI IS TOO
Sir kyle richh I want to thank you for this beautiful song, I can't express this feeling I'm experiencing right now. When my ear lobes come into contact with the sound waves of your music my body elegantly starts getting sturdy these inexplicable feelings that u make me feel is the whole entirety of the reason why I watch you sir kyle richh. Your music is equivalent to the stars colliding and forming the most powerful luminous stellar explosion also known as supernova and the nuclear fusion it takes to make this is just immense but to you it is one of many several explosions you make everytime you drop a song sir kyle
THIS IS THE BEST 41 SONG!!

The reason Kyle Richh is successful is cause his music is authentic. He built a loyal fanbase on consistency, and not being swayed into sounding like every artist. I pray one day my music can touch masses like Kyle Richh. But for now I'm just happy being a fan
Censored?
Officially a Rich fan all the way from South Africa. Stompem out
Straight Fireeeeee
Sir kyle richh I want to thank you for this beautiful song, I can't express this feeling I'm experiencing right now. When my ear lobes come into contact with the sound waves of your music my body elegantly starts getting sturdy these inexplicable feelings that u make me feel is the whole entirety of the reason why I watch you sir kyle richh. Your music is equivalent to the stars colliding and forming the most powerful luminous stellar explosion also known as supernova and the nuclear fusion it takes to make this is just immense but to you it is one of many several explosions you make everytime you drop a song sir kyle
