pass to the ball Jefferson for inpt
Rodgers last game with over 300 yds
Bears #21 has to be one of the worst DB performances i have ever seen. I noticed he was benched in the 2nd half. Also Fields had a terrible game that night. He kept the same struggles until his 3rd year in Chicago: only look for his first read and if it is not open then proceed to panic run or get sacked.
Fields just hung the ball out there for Douglas
I now remember why we lost that divisional, special teams.
These Bears vs Packers games are so fun when they’re competitive. That first half felt like war

6:48 lol Adams hits the camera guy in the face
Fields plays the same way!
Bears fan have to realize the Bears are not he same caliber of team the packers are, it will take some time like it or not we may only break even this year at best. We have mediocre receivers and tight ends not the cream of the crop.
Anybody else back here getting ready for Bears/Packers 2022 week 2? This is almost identical to 2012 when the Bears and Packers met in week 2 in front of a primetime national audience. The Bears won their opener then just like they did this year and the Packers were coming in off a season opening loss just like they are this year. I'll be shocked if the result is much different than it was back than since the Bears can literally never beat Rodgers.
Bears got robbed by the reffs
I do have to say Aaron Rodgers needs to move to a different team. he might look like a homeless, but he is a great QB
May be the worse special teams team of ALL TIME!  The coach wouldn't fire the dude....cost them playoff game. Side note....  I am not sold at all on Pack head coach....Not saying he is bad....but let's see how good he is without 12.....
Makes no difference, of course, but that last play he probably should have just batted it down; taking over on downs would have given the Packers better field position.
Fields got that storm trooper aim for accuracy
Did Blue see Green in Week 14 of the 2021 NFL season and was it between the Chicago Bears and the Green Bay Packers?
This team looks better then 2009 bears....for damn sure.....
This game definitely rigged
Bears was close
@9:07 this is why the Bears can't have good quarterbacks. Let him take hits on an option handoff for 5 yards? No thanks.
There's no way the Packers' horrible special teams will come back to bite them in the playoffs. No way.
4:32 I felt that
Davante Adams 13 targets 10 receptions 121 receiving yards 2 receiving touchdowns 24.1 Fantasy Points!
Aaron Rodgers C/ATT  29/37 341 passing yards 4 passing touchdowns 29.6 Fantasy Points!
Good game

Worst special teams performance I have ever seen. Every single change of possession was a nightmare.
IM SURPRISED
I like the chicago bears because my dads big brother is from chicago
Not being able to advance the ball off a KR or PR fumble seems like a dumb rule.
as a bears  fan...i hope next year the bears just forfeit the games against green bay...treatthem like 2 extra bye weeks...get healthy ...go at it the next week....why even play this team anymore?
Special teams needs a change been the worst special teams unit in the nfl for a decade now
Who else noticed that Davante Adams bounced the football off of a camera man‘s face after scoring a TD? Lol Omg! @ 6:48
When you have some receivers with butter in their hands, you end up losing with 30 points...😕😩
sports
Such a great first packers game for me and my dad such a dream come true
Anyone else notice the camerman getting decked by the ball in the face at 6:47 or just me?? LMAO
If you MOCK THE BELT(QUINN) YOU WILL PAY DEARLY!!! MY BEST ADVICE TO ALL TEAMS IS DONT MOCK THE BELT WHEN PLAYING THE PACKERS! #GO PACK GO
6:40💀💀💀
@11:54..The special team's defenders will now have to learn to spin back inwards if they touch that white line.  I know sometimes they are not aware they are out that far but if/or once they do...
Give fields more time an actual coach and weapons and he will be a problem for years to come
We got cheated
10:43 and 6:40 wtf Eddie Jackson?  Cannot tackle or cover anymore.  He's a huge issue in our secondary.
6:40 and the previous play are why Jackson needs to go.  He misses a tackle after blowing coverage on this play, and the play before just jogs towards 2 other Bears tackling rather than playing full speed and getting in on the tackle.  He's afraid of contact...and that means if he's not covering or getting interceptions he has to go.
#CowboysFanHere  BTW They need to change that onside kick rule lmao 🤣🤦‍♂️  for some reason you can’t advance an onside kick if your on the kicking team and recover it…. but you can run it back for a touchdown if your on the receiving team and recover the onside kick??? #BULLSHIT The bears could have came back and onside kicked it after that first onside kick and possibly could have gotten another onside recovery and a chance to drive it and tie the game lol  #NFLPleaseChangeTheOnsideKickReturnRule
The Bears killed themselves 3 times. This game would have been totally different without those costly Bears penalties.
Matt Nagy must be ghosted
Rodgers literally toys with the bears. Dude owns that team
Bears got rob again
DON'T MOCK THAT BELTTT
🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻_ 🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻_🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻😁
I'm a Packers fan living in Korea, I think our special team is similar to the level of the special team of Kimchi Bowl in Korea.
6:35 all time NFL highlight. This play is perfect
I think GB opponents from now on should always go for an onside kick. Punting on 1st drive is also an option
wtf is up with our special teams? if it wasnt for them we woulda won by 30.
This game needs to be added to the "don't disrespect the belt" highlights video on YouTube.
The final score of this game has occurred only twice in NFL history. Both were in 2021.
Watching the special teams screw up so much was funny af lol
I forgot how fast Jakeem Grant is lol my gosh he fast asf
The practice of Green Bay fans showing adoration to players when they score is just obnoxious. It turns my stomach every time I witness it.
They bears could have win but chocked again!
Green Bay won't win a Super Bowl with those special teams and that shoddy tackling.
Commentators are so dry, I’d rather watch on mute…
Man, the Packers were clearly the superior team and we knew that. However, the special teams is a legitimate problem. I mean that long punt return TD had no business going all the way. That was just poor play. And they got lucky as hell on the muffed punt. Plus some other mistakes. I mean, they could have trounced the Bears in this game and still lost just on special teams errors.
Pra quem veio ver o Cairão da bicudas! 1:23 7:46 14:13
You can’t give up 3 touchdowns in one quarter and then another 17 more in the very next quarter and think you’re going to win
The Green Bay Packers Own The Chicago Bears As They Never Seem To Beat Them And They Are Definitely Going To The Playoffs As For Chicago I'm Not To Sure!!!
My goodness how can anyone watch this soft, weak garbage. The anti white racism doesn't really bother me. The weak, wimpy game they have created is pathetic and it is all about making it more appealing to women. One day pro football might return to what it was meant to be, a battle of might between men. I don't see that happening anytime soon. The players want to be paid a kings ransom and enjoy complete adulation with no risk. I used to love the NFL but not anymore,  not whatever this is...
I think the ref made “two” terrible calls on both touchdowns that they brought back, especially on the second one with the onside kick return. Hell I even played Madden last week and recorded my first on side kick return, though I didn’t score they still allow me to advance forward after I recovered the ball, so I’m definitely confused on that second flag call. Without the uncalled for penalties, the entire paradigm of the entire game would have been completely different.
They put the "special" in special teams
Saw this one live in Lambeau Field and geeze was it a wild one. I was 19 rows up on the Packer 50 line, jersey-reading distance. Our abysmal special teams performance was just something I'd never seen before and Rodgers definitely held the Pack together. Go Pack Go!!
Packers special teams looking crappy as ever! 🙃
Aaron Rogers is one of the GOATS 🐐 .  I also look forward to seeing how Justin Fields develops, he is becoming a great player.
Lol that fail GB stiff arm had me rolling!
As a niners fan, I want to say that my franchise should be digusted with themselves, and should be berated at any and all times. The 49ers franchise will have always made the biggest mistake in sports history. Worse than Pete Carroll throwing the ball at the 1. Worse than the Rockets taking Hakeem over Jordan (this one isn't too big a deal because Hakeem is an all time great player, spoiler alert, Alex Smith isn't) Worse than the Falcons giving up a 28-3 lead. Say what you want about different teams needing players at other positions. Every franchise that passed on Rodgers should NEVER be forgiven for this. 2005 draft night might as well have been an audition for the circus.
BLACKS MEXICANS AND NATIVE AMERICANS 12 TRIBES OF ISRAEL WE ARE GOD CHOSEN PEOPLE THE REAL HEBREW ISRAELITES
Can someone please explain this "advancement" rule? I'm confused🤔
The Chicago bears are better than the green bay packers. Lol.
I hope we keep our qb
6:40 😂why he hit him in the face like that after the play
ESE TOUCHDOWN que realizo los bears, con la patada de regreso, fue uno de los mas grandes robos!! por eso detesto a los green
The bears got played on special teams, that special team coach for the bears needs a raise🙏🏾
Man was working with Johnson on Adams, yet coming out of the half that changed and look what happened.
Matthew 26:42 He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.
Packers almost got bent over and packed by a bear
Great bear game! Im ok with a cheesefuck win but spare me of the ever repeating bullshit discussions of Packers gat anywhere near the Bowl...........
i was always a packers fan ....not any more   #aaronrodgers
Grant is a human whippet.
The out of bounds penalty was easily the dumbest call this year. A doubled teamed defender that had nothing to do with the play. Getting real bored of penaltyball.
"We are not amused." Rex Victoria.
Wow. Both teams came to play! This game was exciting. GB just outgunned Chicago. I also disagree with that out of bounds call on the muffed punt catch by GB. Chicago's special teams showed out on both sides of the ball tho... 👀👀 And Idk where this Fields guy came from, but Chicago might have a weapon on their hands with that QB. I like the way he plays. He has a nice arm and speed. But of course Rogers does it again. This was definitely a fun game to watch tho 👌🏽
Someone needs to save Justin Fields from the Bears quick
It was so many scripted plays in this game
2:47 bro got picked up by one of the lineman
The first Bears touchdown was absolutely spectacular and they would have deserved more luck in this game.
Horrible officiating. Bears were robbed of those legitimate touchdowns.
1:42, meanwhile, your team only has 4 wins🥳.
Lmao they were out there playing Madden on special teams today
🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳😁😁😁😁😁
The bears did not want to go home but they are going
How did the bears blow this 🤦🏾‍♂️?
7:01 the guy who spams slide tackles in FIFA.
Quinn taunting Aaron Rodgers with Rodgers “Championship Belt” taunt. Aaron saw that and said, “Oh really kid? Ok” So Aaron and the Pack had to remind them of what happened on that Season Opener game in the second half.
14:45 can someone explain why this isn't a td?
American football looks dumb
also referee calls on penalties that are not critical to the outcome of the play seems unnecessary. dude was out of bounds on the punt for like 1.5 seconds and wasnt even near the punt reciever when he boofed the catch. seems rather petty
bears let the packers score twice easily in redzone because bears had ran man to man coverage and the line backers bet on it being a run
Rodgers your dump passing is all you do.
Chicago special teams almost carried
From FG kicks & returns, the packers special teams is HORRIBLE. But a nice win for Rodgers and the offense 🧀
Should never mock the belt on Rodgers... 😂
Not so special teams. Could've been a BIG TIME blow out but still happy with the win.
Can we please just take a few days and teach these kids how to catch a punt?  We’ve muffed at least one just about every game this season.
dillon is just a tank man like wow
13:48 - 13:58 if that was mahomes making those great plays, the commentators would be going crazy....
As a Packers fan, our special teams are indeed "special"
THAT'S MY TEAM!!!!!   WAYYYYYYYYYYYYY better than the Denver Donkeys
my god the special teams
So we not gonna talk about  Deontae Adams hitting the camera man 😂 in the face with the ball
With 13 minutes left in the 4th quarter the muffed punt returned by the bears double whammy of "can't be advanced" and the bullshit call of the bears player who went out if bounds without immediately coming back in bounds(which he clearly did) was a killer so was the other "can't be advanced" muffed kickoff for a td. That's 14 points off the board, where did this rule even come from it makes no sense, I don't see the logic to it but as a bears fan I'm just happy the game was competitive and not over before it started.. we all knew throughout the game it was way harder for bears offense to score and move the ball than it was for green bay. The law of averages played out through 4 quarters green bay is the better team and has been for majority of the Favre/Rodgers Era.. that comfortable lead chicago had on gb has been depleted and now gb holds a 8(ish) game all time lead just in time for hopefully a fields Era that pans out lol
I would have loved to see the Bears win this one.
“I OWN YOU!”
The Packers played awful in this game. Plenty of turnovers, Blown coverages. If it wasn't for the brilliance of Aaron Rodgers they would have taken an L.
3:26
bear dahn huh zito
The bears nice man idc what no one says. It's so much potential  #BEARDOWN
gb got lucky.  lots of morons in gb in week 14
Poor Chicago...one of my favorite teams from my favorite city.  Like Detroit, they just don't have it together yet.  Maybe one day!
5:33 Best touchdown of The game
Dang the Baer could of won
For some reason I feel like Chicago gave up or ran out of gas somewhere in the middle of 3rd quarter🤔
My favorite Packers vs Bears rivalry showdown game at Lambeau Field of all time!!
3:27 is the play fake Pat Mcafee was talking about in the interview with Aaron
The Bears don't need to rebuild🕵they need to retool☺look what New England is doing😁
adams hit guy  in the face with the ball at 6:48 lol
Always keep God first
God bless you guys
God bless don't forget to keep God first
3:28 this is one of the cleanest pa passes I ever seen 💯
Bears have no chance to get to playoffs ,so this game was kinda like our Highlight for the year, they played good but lost anyway. Better luck next year.
First game at Lambeau, and that was electric
6:48 😭😭😭😭😭
are the bears returners just that brilliant or do the packers just suck on special team?
Gronk, Mr. Budweiser! Ok. You and Me who do you think Johnny Depth thinks smarter and has communication skill.
6:47 davante hits a photographer in the face when he tosses the football behind himself. whoops.
Super fun game to attend in person. Happy to be there, GPG!!!
we love carilina panters and green bay packers
I was at this game awesome time my 1st game ever and after 16 years being with my GF i asked her to be my wife at half time 💍 definitely a game I will all ways remember 💚💛
Thank god we got the goat Aron Rodgers to pick up the slack from special teams this game! How about AJ Dillion tho for doin all the heavy running and getting us down the field, don’t think he gets enough credit…
Actually insane how many lucky points the Bears got at the start and still lost
Trump set to shred Atlantic Ocean OCTOPUS monument protection, Why?
We all know what happens when you do the belt taunt against Rodgers. Then add in the fact that you’re on the Bears .. yk your ass gonna get smoked.
Explosive, fast and violent game. You live to see it!
damn they gotta fire the whole special team
Sorry, but Fields doesn't look like he has it. I understand he's a rookie, he's on the Bears. But that loopy wind up of his..noway.
That touch pass Rodgers has used 3 or 4 times this year. Honestly, I think he goes I got like a foot on this guy 30 yards away. Insane.
Herbert and Grant the beauty of the bears
Don't ever put on Rodger's Belt !!!!!...Bad things happen !!!!!
What's Tae gotta do to be in the MVP convo?
as a bears fan, i was expecting to lose but justin fields has earned the respect. bad o line and going against a good defense, he worked for what he could do. but i noticed everytime i was watching rodgers, it’s just so smooth. he really makes it look easy and i can’t hate him for being good
I did not notice Quinn mocked the belt a second time. Guess it didn’t turn out very well for him….
Jakeem Grant carried the Bears till the half
nfl officiating gets worse with every week, this has been the worst week of officiating i have ever seen all the years i’ve been watching football, even college isn’t this bad, we need full time officials
Fields is looking like the 2nd best rookie QB in the league at the moment. He must keep learning from his mistakes, finish this season on a high note & make this Bears coaching position look really attractive this upcoming off-season.
The Bears defense made too many mental mistakes!
I wonder what Fields would look like playing for Belichek on the Patriots.

every year we see the same old garbage .  on special teams no kick off returner no punt returner bad coverage poor tackling. poor coaching . because the packers are to cheap to hire a decent special teams coach. this is why Aaron rodgers  is so frustrated his great talent has been wasted. and come january him and the packers are gonna get bounced again. because of the special teams mess.
Mr. Douglas is to good! What a wonderful surprise he is
CNN  Election Projection sound: Just in Chicago elected a new mayor and its Green Bay Packers Quarterback, 3xMVP, and Super Bowl 45 champion/MVP Aaron Rodgers will be projected to be the next mayor of Chicago a city that he already owns
watching aaron rogers play is like watching an artist paint, everything he does is beautiful
sorry...why was that onside kick touchdown called back ?? dont understand.
AJ Dillon is a beast....💪💪
How DARE they omit the best play of the game... The Victory Formation with Kurt Benkert!!! The AUDACITY!
Besides Bojorquez, GB's special teams has been terrible this year. Remember that as poorly as Jordan Love played, we still were in a position to win that Chiefs game if it wasn't for special teams mistakes. Missed FGs/PAs, kick/punt return fumbles and mistakes, and poor kick/punt coverage have been way too common. Meanwhile offense and defense are rolling despite most of our all pros being injured most of the season.
Not advancing on a turnover by a kick has got to be the dumbest rule in the game. Why? What's the logic behind that? Afraid of teams exploiting a punt? Yeah right.
Everybody together now : And a 1, and a 2, and a 3... THE BEARS STILL SUCK🎵
6:39 ARod sheeshh🔥🔥🔥
3:28 Rodgers gives a lesson on how to execute the play - action fake. 13:08 Adam's move leaves the Bears' defender with buckled knees.  TD GBP !!! This was the Bears' Super Bowl. This was just another step on the Packs' road to the Super Bowl. Packer fans watching this video : 1.4 million Bears fans watching this video : 0.0

That punt that the packers player dropped should have been a touchdown total bs that it got called back
Just fields is gonna be alright
Mighty Mouse Grant! Glad to see him having success. And then against the P... Wasn't enough, but what else can I wish for, except a different QB, HC and GM for my own team and, of course, a Superbowl before I die, HAHA! Grant was a beast in college and overlooked in the draft. And I always wanted him on my team. In the right system he can be "Hill 2.0" but way more humble! SKOL!
Even if the ball was touched by the receiving team it cannot be advanced?
Has nobody learned yet that you just DONT AND I MEAN DONT MOCK THE BELT?!?!?!
Lmao why D.Adams popped the camera man wit the football 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
*Aaron Rodgers, Davante Adams, Aaron Jones & Rasul Douglas* 💪🏽😏🧀🏈🧀🧀
Packers had a field day
The Packers have the worst special teams in the league. Plus Mason Crosby has been terrible
Feilds and pffensive line impress me .
thats 22 untucked shirt fines 5:40
poor camera guy @2:47 hahaha Reminds me of that tennis players behind the back throat hit
The highlights used to be only the touchdowns and scoring. With only a couple of the big plays. That was better.
This game shows how bad the packers really are there terribleness is being hide behind a Araon Rodgers mask
UK viewer here 14:44 why is that called back and not a TD?
That Adams/Rodgers chemistry is pretty spectacular.
Clearly Rodgers meant he owns the Refs that call the Packers Bears game.
And here I thought the loss to the Seahawks was the worst special teams performance I would ever see. How does the ST coach still have a job?
Jakeem balling! Good job bro.
I'm getting me a AJ Dillon jersey he's my favorite RB in the league
Marqui Christian's blocking on the kick return for a td was outstanding.
surprised rodgers and laflour didnt cry their way to a win in this one
Arron Rodgers is such a great player. In an era  full of special QBs, the Mannings, Flacco, Big Ben, Wilson and the G.O.A.T., (and others) Rodgers is as good as any, better than most. Only the special ones win an MVP.  It's such a shame he is a LIAR. I admired you Arron, I don't follow the Packers but I've always been an avid fan of yours. LIAR If you choose not to get vaccinated that's your right. I am, but no one has a right to tell you to. No one has a right to deliberately deceive others regarding your decision. Follow the protocols and you don't need to LIE. No matter what you do, how you try to rewrite the narrative or what further LIES you try to tell YOU ARE A LIAR. You're a hell of a ball player, no one can take all your success from you, you can't take back being a LIAR. For as long as people talk about you it will be Superbowl, MVP and LIAR. You earned them all🖕
30-45 makes it seem closer than it really was 🤣
I needed the packer to win by 12 to win a ticket...super lucky :)
Green Bay Packers Special Ed teams.
Number 8 was unsuccessful wit ruining this game at the last minute
1:19 Robinson was open in the back of the EZ. 🤦‍♂️ Fields is horrible! Mad inaccurate, tunnel vision. Bears should offer Texans Fields for Watson & some picks with future picks. This project with Fields isn’t gonna fly. At all!
NFL has stupid a$$ rules of not advancing the ball!
Bro fields is starting to look so good🔥 give him time ! 1-2 years he’s definitely going to be a problem!
Go pack go
really fun game to watch
The Bears and Fields have a lot of potential
This was the besrs game ngl
GB offence team vs GB special team video highlight
Bears have usually had good defense. Chicago is a linebacker and running back town.   The Bears can't handle a good quarterback. That is why in 2005 draft they passed on Aaron Rodgers  for Cedric Benson.  Cutler never had the support he needed.
6:48
Never mock the belt...... and just luck cuz special teams did plenty to almost screw it up... but luckily defense and offense did their job ..
That horse dewormer really has AR struggling…
I'm really becoming  tired of the pathetic  defensive  plays by most nfl team does anyone tackle anymore!..no that's right corral  them too  the sideline then push them out ..such an weak option as they make another 10yards on the play..TACKLE TACKLE they can't run with no legs ..just last week a bears defensive  player let a wide receiver run rings around him ..c,mom man
I don't believe in Rogers anymore after he lied about vaccination. State Farm should lose him as a spokesman. I don't wanna see him anymore. I used to look up to him. Not anymore.
🎬MANTAP📽 👍⭐🇲🇨⭐👍
Throwing it so high man damn calm down
Love the game.  Calling all owners&players in the NFL,NHL,NBA&MLB to donate 20%&10% respectively this financially tough holiday season 4 food security, kids toys,sweets,books& hygienik products. Will lovingly volunteer brain&muscle 2 deliver the goods throughout North America days before X-Mas.
Adams ah whole cheat code💪🏾
The bears almost owned Aron Rogers in first half then they collapsed. Players r good need new coaching staff time to clean house
Marcedes Lewis is a beast. See here! 13:00
Don't care
I was there
How the hell was Rasoul Douglas in the practice squad.
Go Pack Go 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈
Always love beating our rivals but 1 thing really put a smile on my face was watching old man Lewis make a few catches. Great player.
I can't believe Collingsworth is still employed? I hope the rumours of Tony Romo replacing him are true.
Aron own the Bears plain and simple🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
14 points stole from the Bears is what I see
They cheated the Bears 🐻
Bears were cheaten by 2 touchdowns. Refs supported GB
Love watching Grant turn on the afterburners!
My toes were frozen, but what a game. I still don’t have my voice back.
Why anyone mocks the belt I don't understand! It has never ended well for them
Bears doesn’t deserve Fields. I don’t wanna jinx him, but he might the first Ohio St QB to thrive in the NFL. He has potential and I wish him nothing the best.
Lmao the Bears are the definition of hot garbage in the NFL. Id rather be the Lions. 10/10 times.
That's Green Bay football....
No my bears lost 😡
still doesn't matter how many games the "Peckers" win...they're gonna lose in the playoffs anyway
Fields look`s like Sid the Sloth from ice age.
Special teams is an embarrassment. Get it together already,
Aaron Rodgers was fenomenal … again 💪🏆
I'm sick and tired of hearing about Justin fields. He needs to get the ball off faster. Stop looking for open guys and throw to where the guy is going to be. I I said in my last post that defensive coordinator has not even played one game of football. I want heads on a platter I want Justin fields benched.
*gets two defensive special teams touchdowns* “you can’t advance it”
The bears did way better then I expected
Packers will get eliminated in playoffs.
that was a great game and how come Grant never played that good in Miami lol
You know you good when you trick the camera man
that reversal on the kickoff fumble was horrible. guy was nowhere near the play. NFL not even trying to hide their bias now lol
6:46 did anyone else see that? Lmao dude got it right in the face lmao 😂
Aaron Rodgers is a hell of a QB
Dude just had to do the belt😂
You can't advance a recovered onside kick?  WHY THE HELL NOT???
God dang that bears running back is quick!
Ahh I see this was a great match between the Green G and the Orange C. Teams with such history in the sport. -Football Expert
Best second quarter ever like wtf was I watching💀
When I saw the bears defensive player do the belt I knew it was over for them
Haha Justin Fields, the REAL NVP baby hahahaha, Trubisky this and Trubisky that but look at your guy?!?! NVP NVP NVP Field 2021 NVP baby
Packers ST is gonna be getting their cardio in this week for practice 🤣
Why didnt the bears td count on the free kick?  A player stepped out of bounds i know, but he wasnt the player who recover the ball??
Is it just me or has this whole NFL season been more entertaining than the ones in recent years?
feel bad for the bears ... all those lost TD's
When it goes from 0:41 to 13:10, there’s no greater feeling
Why can't you advance an on-side kick? (like Bears did at the end of the game). Srely it's no different to advancing from a kick return, once the other player's touched it you should be able to run it in for td?
One of Rodgers best games I've seen. Could easily be Green Bay and Tampa Bay in NFC Championship game. Special teams play needs help..
Hey we are first half champions baby!!!
Can we add a speed rusher once or twice a game...come on man. 4 man rush is just too predictable. How do you shake up a rook QB. Put him on his back early and often.
Where are the Bears shuffling crew?🤔
That Packer TD before the half reminded me of when my beagle caught a rabbit, but the second dog knocked the first one off, and the lucky rabbit was able to escape...darndest thing to see!!!
Any NFL team that visits the Packers at Lambeau Field should know that there is a very high percentage that a defeat is imminent. 😏
Nice game lots of drama
Better rethink that special teams play GB.....it should have been and would have been a blow out...if not for them.
Okay, who had the O/U 43.5 in this game? Over b4 half-time!
If we lose, it will be our special teams fault smh
6:46 that ball totally smashed camera dudes face lol
i find it crazy that the bears had the packers in the first half but then quickly fell apart in the second half
1:19 IF HE TOOK HIS TIME THE BEARS EAS GONNA BE UP A TD BLOWN D WR WIDE OPEN
They didn't show the highlight of the night.  Kurt Benkert getting into the game to take the final kneel-down!
Packers got saved by that call at the end there with Vildor.  I mean, the refs have traditionally helped the Packers in every game. Last night was no exception.
Bears fan and Aaron Rodgers OWNS US! That is until we change ownership and fire Pace and Nagy!
6:45 Adams throws ball behind back after TD catch, hits poor camera man right in the face lol
Fields is Nuts! my God man
packers won fair and square i just can’t can’t cris collingsworth bias in the game. all i want is to hear a commentator talk about the game and the plays they’re running instead of sucking off aaron rodgers.
bottom Line Aaron rogers will beat you-- simply the best in nfl right now
Fields will be a pro bowler in a few years.
The fact the Packers put up 45 and easily won with all the special teams errors shows how talented this Packers team really is.
I’m a pack fan but if I could do 3 things to the team to make it better would be, better special teams (Obviously)  Arod stays   Adams stays.
Special teams is trash omfg
bears vs refs ong
Is there a clause in AJ Dillion's contract limiting his TDs lol
sniped @fotographer 6:46
The fact that you can’t advance an onside kick or muffed punt is such a terrible rule
Yeah yes sir sir
I still own you." Aaron rodgers
Really good game
Lmao anyone notice Davante just casually beaning the camera man in the face with the ball after scoring that TD??
Someone wake up Eddie Jackson and tell him to make a play !!!
Quinn should’ve never mocked the belt 💪🏾 #GPG 💚💛💚💛
Davante Adams’ release on that last touchdown >
When the Packers activate their short game, its nigh on impossible to stop that offense.
When Mason Crosby started missing easy FGs, he took the special teams down with him
The special team were out partying night before the game haha hangover for sure :D
I'm a Packers fan, but these rules are BS. Let players advance the ball
Packer's special teams is definitely special.
Defense went hard the 2nd half 💪 only let up 3pts 👌
Yeah packers
I'm a cowboys fan, real talk the bears got cheated. I feel for them
Aaron Rodgers owns both the Bears and Vikings!!! I 🖤 #12 AR!!! I love Aaron Rodgers!!!
Congrats to the Green Bay Packers winning the game at home!!! Let's go Packers!!! Go Pack Go!!! How bout them Packers in Green Bay!!! On Wisconsin!!! I love Green Bay!!!
Yes
Bears won the first half
The Packers wore the Bears down but they also had all the luck and the decisions went their way.
Aaron Rodgers is Q1 sorry
One of the most exciting game I've seen this season!
I'm old and slow, fellas, but could somebody tell me WTF is "Cristina" selling? I'd go 'n check it out, but, I'm afraid of catching a virus. Maybe one of you invincible, young studs has? Thanks.
Aaron Rodgers is an American hero
As the late, great Dennis Green once said, "The Bears are who we thought they were."
defense did a good job only allowing 3 points in the second half
The bears up 24-14 be like: “we are off to a perfect start let’s show this mofo he don’t own us!”  Rodgers: “hold my pinky toe”
Justin fields is gonna be a key player to watch next year if he gets a better team or help.
special teams need to step up.
As a packers fan the muffed punt call was a bad call should have been bears ball
If you slow it down at 6:48 and watch how Adams accidentally decks the photographer with the football after his touchdown is hilarious. 😂
The NFL needs to Re-evaluate some of these Ridiculous Rules in place. SMH. I don’t even gotta say it, Packers fans know we got some Heat coming...
What happened to the GB special teams? Are they lame or something?
Bears fan here, any game where we score 30 is a well played game in my book. Like what 2nd time we’ve scored 30 all year? I’ll take it against the Pack especially
I was there for my first game and I couldn’t ask for a better game but special teams need to do something soon
Packers special teams give the Bears great field position and TDs....but Bears give up a fumble, a pick 6, and Rodgers still owns the Bears.
They owned them
I still maintain that Fields will be the best QB out of this draft, just give him a competent HC and a line
Colinsworth’s laugh when Rodgers hit that fake
The special team coach needs to be fired immediately! What a $hit show.
Every time someone throws the belt they lose

Bears looked good in the first half, Rodgers just dissected them in the second
I STILL OWN YOU
11:40 worst call ever, he went out of bounds it doesnt matter as long as he dont touch the ball nver heard of a flag for goin out of bounds.
I wish Justin Fields was playing for the Steelers.
*Don’t. Mock. The. Belt.*
nice job with the highlights but im sure this game made it easy for you
GO PACK! YAAAAAAAHOOOOOOOO!
6:47 Did anyone else see Adams throw the ball RIGHT at the photographer's face?? Lol
https://youtu.be/_EgZ0Ty-7w8
AJ Dillon is a bull dozer!
Loveit
This was a fun game
I will admit we have a very solid quarterback for the Bears now but all we need is some offensive threats for wide receivers and tight ends then I think the Bears will have a good year for once
I have never seen someone foul there own teammates.
Im a packers fan and I think they need to change the cant advance it rule for special teams thats so dumb. If the special teams is so bad they allow a recovery and a TD return on a onside kick then the kicking team deserves that TD honestly
I want to be mad as hell my bears are losing again but I’m hoping the get rid of the gm and the coach
Awesome win Packers! Go Pack go!🧀 We never quit!
Our special teams became special needs last night
Can someone explain to me why the short kick touchdown wasn't good? 14:23
Aaron Rodgers: One of the greatest quarterbacks ever  And also a big dumdum outside the field
Total scratchiest! Did you see the “GRINCH” in the stands (with the Packers sleeveless sweater on?
6:48 dude got hit right in the face by the ball
Packers done me proud again 🥰
Special teams . Just a bad game now they do this every single game. People freak out too much 🙂
They will not be mocked!
He was owning Chicago and knowing it...we all know it.
Is this the worse special teams performance ever lol?
We still own them. Man it must suck to be a bears fan
Special Teams gave the cowboys offense a run for their money 😭😭😭😭😭
https://youtu.be/UR07WjlnmZg?t=408 Nice back pass, #17, lol
AARON JONES MR 915 VERY PROUD TO HAVE AN EL PASOAN BE SO GREAT. PLUS IM A DIE HARD PACKERS FAN. IM LOVING IT
11:25 refball! He was engaged with the blocker and only took 2 steps out of bounds…
anyone else see the pretty clean intentional tripping at 0:50 to 0:55 94 and 81
The 2nd quarter though, the kind of game you don't want to end because they're having fun
Did anyone see Devante Adams throw the football at the camera mans face after the touchdown
6:41.  Bears' TWO STOOGES tackle each other, LOL!
Bears played a great game!!!
chicago isnt a horrible team though frl, once justin fields gets more.experience and becomes.better, they will prob be the top contendor in.nfc north.. if rodgers stays with greenbay then bears will be greenbays top.contendor in their division i think, if rodgers leaves and love is qb then greenbay will.need couple years before they become playoff contendors again, unless love is a flop, then we r fkdd
4:30.  Fields tackles himself, LOL!
Someone please explain why on both the muffed punt and onside kick you can’t advance it?
Aaron Rodgers is still NFL’s number one he’s not ready to relinquish it anytime soon..haters hate on it…NFL we don’t buy the Brady hype were not stupid we know football we choose not you
That’s what the trash bears get for Quin mocking the belt smh
that grant dude runs like 23 mph
as a packer fan, the call on the muffed punt was bullshit, that should have been a td
GB fan in Michigan since Favre, awesome game! Definitely not a Lion's fan 😂🤣
As a BIG fan of EVERY team and its players. This game, officiating wise, was trash.
That throw at 9:00 is insane perfect timing, and perfect placement. Rodgers the GOAT
how about matt laflauers game plan the second half though wow
The bears could be winless n they would still air this gm on prime time, this is football’s Yankees-Red Sox
quinn fked up by do rodgers belt in.front of him on that sack
Green Bay looks like frauds again. I won’t bet on them in the playoffs
#17 Grant is a game changer
Okay, we lost. But this looked a better defeat (is there such a thing?) than the last game.
Jesus, that’s the worst special teams performance in a game I think I’ve ever seen.
This game should have been won by the Bears.
What does it mean when they say you can't advance it?
5:40 97 yards in 15 seconds.  97÷15= 6.4 yards per second.😳 Not too fast but fast enough to beat everyone else on the field..😄
2 nonsensical policy calls/flags/ and the game is lost .Just sad how these policy calls kills the game if football .
this tears me seeing that the bears could have won this game
Number 98 caused fate to his team 1:45
'Dog Face' Rodgers may own The Bears, but Tom Brady owns Rodgers, GB is not going to the Super Bowl (period)
This might be the year Packers get back to the Super Bowl. I don't see LA Rams or Dallas getting there, and I think Green Bay can handle Arizona. Only problem may be Tampa Bay.
I like that Grant guy. He is Penske material for sure.
Packers really should have won by 30... wtf is wrong with the special teams
Chicago's best thing about them is there special teams
Special teams off a perc
As a lions fan feilds scares me
One of the most exciting games I have seen in a long time.  Love a Packers Bears game!
Okay Bears coach, 4th & inches, behind in the 4th quarter, with Rodgers (and a serious run game) on the other side. What do you do? Punt?????? Not a Bears or Packers fan. I actually like the Packers better, but all we are saying, is give Fields a chance
Man these running QB's are exciting to watch, maybe someday they will actually be good enough to win a Superbowl lol
Those rules are BS. Two TDs basically thrown away
Jenkins decided to just get more penalties in one game than the bears did all season.
Everyone just saying “as a (team) fan” no one has to know
There’s so many reasons why the bears could have and should have won this game. Stupid little missed catches. Jenkins AWFUL, kmet AWFUL.
You score 30 and still loose by 15. You'll never win with that type of effort.
bruh davante hits the camera man in the face with the ball at 6:47😂
Why is Rogers even playing? Where's Love thats who the fans want!
anyone who knows Grant's story is proud of him right now!
Good game!
Packers fan. Refs stole two special teams TDs from the Bears, imo.
I love my Packers and the direction we're heading. But our special teams is 🤢🤮
At 6:49 Adams hits this dude right in the face with the football and I can’t stop laughing 😂
The plays that the packers have for Adams is beautifully designed 👌🏾
Bears sucks
The Packers special team performance is probably the worst you can find in any game played by any team
The packers got bailed bears should have won
Is anyone else wondering if Chris is the worst color man in the history of broadcast sports?  He adds nothing to the game, his comments are not needed.
game of the year thoughts??
Bears got screwed out of two touchdowns
The  bears are our customers 😁
yeah bears suck but i like how they played lots of energy
You know the bears players should stop the individual celebration.
i hate aaron rodgers
I thought was great game no forced throws from Fields. Frozen tundra (Wisconsin) and Rogers is forced to be reckoned with. 🧀...
The first half offense is the best I’ve ever seen from 2 teams playing each other
Justin Fields reminds briefly a young Russel Wilson... i do not know why...
At 2:40 Al Michael's sounded as unenthusiastic as possible after that long bears run for a touchdown. That was as one-sided and bias of a "national" broadcast as I have ever seen. Michael's and Collins Collinsworth made their admiration for Rodgers clear.
As a Viking fan,  Packers need to use A Jones a hell of a lot more .. then y’all really dangerous
6:47 Adams hit that cameraman right in the face haha
Rodgers was playing against the bears and his own special teams
Al Robinson wants to be a paid #1 WR.  However there has been too many high impact players where the ball was thrown to him and did not catch.  Yes they are tough catches to make but if he wants to be paid, he needs to make those.  He has not so, let him walk.
Packers fans thank the Cardinals for not knowing what they had on their roster allowing the packers to poach Rasul Douglas.
I give credit to the Bears they play to win
Bears fan for life but secondary is slow and can’t cover a bed sheet. QB needs to practice on his aiming and accuracy. I seen a dome plays he throwing the ball to high . Line can’t hold a cup of water. LB can’t read a run play . If wasn’t for Green Bay running game and special teams not messing up this will bad blow out. 🐻 down for hibernation
I think Green Bay is one of the best teams in the NFL, but my God do something about your  special team, every time Chicago returned a kickoff it was near midfield.
Rodgers enters TOEVID protocols, expected to take medical advice from noted moron Joe Rogan.
the flag against the bears... I dont know.
Commentator sounds like he wanted GB to win lol.
Justin Fields is a future superstar
Rodgers 😍
The special teams needs work, they have not had a great special teams since Nolan Cromwell was the special teams coordinator   under Mike Holmgren
Packers O line won this game.  Their playoff run will depend on their play above everything else.  Aaron Rogers is Trent Dilfer if he doesn't have those supremely talented linemen in front of him.
All of Illinois is swimming in cheese
I OWN YOUUUUUUU!
as a packer fan I can admit the refs made sure if nothing else we won
Why couldn’t he return the onside? Is it bc the receiving team touched it?
Damn what a game
That bears front office better surround fields with some star players if they wanna keep him
Devante Adams reminds me of your 5 star retro bowl receiver
I could see the packers going to the bowl. And losing on a punt return
At 6:46 Davante Adams is going to hit the camera man in the face
special teams ugly
Ok special team had a bad day .. but at the end we beat the bears AGAIN !! So … go pack go !!
Bears defense mocked the belt so rodgers had to take care of the team he owns
6:40 that sidestep was disgusting
Live betting this game at half time was fugging beautiful
AJ Dillon is a beast on the field
They were playing on Madden arcade mode last night. Fun times.
Never mock the belt
That fake was great but the back would have scored if he handed off
#17 with Dante Hall-lite vibes. Those moves and reversing field near the goal line. 👏🏾
I know it was needed for context, but I like how the one penalty that was added to the highlight reel was a Holding penalty on the Packers. I'm sure the Bears fans loved to see that one 😜
6:48 That camera man got a good shot.  LOL!
Player outta bounds my ass, he was pushed
Can grant be the bears special  gadget guy
How about NBC being savage playing the Eurythmics song "Would I Lie to You" as Rodgers is running onto the field to start their first possession.
Douglass coming of the practice just to get a pix 6 was amazing
Bears have balls Raiders no.
So Rodgers STILL owns the bears 😅🤣
They literally mocked the belt on the first drive 😂😂😂 dumb decision by the bears
That effy out of bounds call really iced the game. Very unfortunate that these questionable calls seem to hurt the bears and keep us out of games.
The bears still thought they could mock the belt and get away with it? Will they never learn🤣
happy the packers got the W, but jesus the Special teams needs to tighten up Can't afford those type of mistakes come playoff time.
Bears had these fuckers best MULTIPLE times this game, and were in it the whole time don’t let that score fool you, these refs were SUSPECT AF last night
He didn't own them they were losing until the 3rd quarter.
A tale of two halves. Bears won the 1st, unfortunately, GB won the 2nd. Chicago's Offense finally scored more than 20 points however, the D gave up 45 points. Only bright spot for the Bears in the game, was seeing 2021, 2nd round draft pick LT Tevin Jenkins in the game as a starter.  I hope McCaskey fires Nagy today, December 13th, so the Bears F.O. can start planning and playing who to interview the HC position.
That 3rd and 18 to Lazard was ridiculous
What a ripoff ……pour reff decisions Seems the packer always find a way
Glad I didn't waste my time watching the game. I knew Chicago would lose
rodgers still owns the bears
Hey Robert Quinn- how's that belt fit ?  Pretty tight ?  Nice of Rodgers to let you try it on for a couple of plays.  Bwhahahaahaaaaa ! Yo MaMa.
He still owns you
Next year with a new coach and new gm and a chance Rodgers will be gone the bears could win the division
The Bears 🐻 really got cheated out of 2 TDs. Which would have made this game so much closer
Hey bears, at least y’all better then the jags, and fields is looking better than Trevor
Devante Adams arone Rogers are killin together
this is a packers game here folks...take the WIN as you all see it...Even people who claim to be Packer fans are shooting them down about this game. Its a rivalry game. Its going to be messy. Its not going to be perfect. We played hard and amazing Rodgers not one turnover and Crosby nice field goals son. Packers amazing game!! Win and everyone knows regardless if the TD counted we still win by 7 to 8 and come on, its RODGERS...dont think for one second he would had not had something under his sleeve. WE all know he would had and we win by 15 regardless.....#gopackgo!!
And here is what happen if you mock the invisible belt
Do we need to lose the Super Bowl because of our special teams? The special teams coach needs to be fired, or the players need to be repositioned. Put the defense on special teams, they want the ball more than the offense apparently.
Will Green Bay save us from TB?
That gunner going out of bounds penalty was terrible - he came right back in and ran 45 yards in bounds. That rule is meant to keep them from running outside the boundary and coming back in for the tackle at the last second. Refs are terrible this year, WTF...
Never mock the belt lol…going to have to tack this game onto the previous “never mock the belt” compilation Go Pack Go 💚💛💚💛💰💯💯💯
That stadium went bananas on the Douglas Pick-6. He should feel good cos he’s a fan favorite now. Just think, he was being stored away on a practice squad. Good Job Green Bay on the Douglas pick up.
Mooney, Kmet, Robinson and graham all have absolute rock hands right now.   They couldn’t catch covid are this point.
Awesome highlights until GB outscored CHI 24-3. At least Bears put up a fight💯 #TBVsKCrematch coming soon..🤔
@10:26 Holding on #79.. Bears O-Line was holding the whole game.. at least #79 was squared up and the D-Lineman never turned his body?
Crazy game. But then no Bear-Packer game ever follows script.
I thought I was watching a Home Broadcast of the Packers on Sunday Night Football, Al Michaels and Chris Collinsworth were gushing like teenagers at the prom with their crush the whole game talking about Aaron Rogers and how honest he is, I don't think they believe Rogers lied about his Vaccination Status. For being a supposed unbiased Broadcast this sure was Biased.
Man this was a good game until the Bears folded in the end…..
Justin Fields is SPECIAL
3:12 good screen by Devontae Adams, GREAT IQ🔥
Holy crap Aaron Rogers is amazing. Terrible special teams play by Green Bay reminded me of my Broncos and some gutsy and athletic QB plays by Justin Fields. I wish my Broncos would have drafted him but he is a raw talent and I'm not sure anyone looks like Rogers this year. Just incredible flick of the wrist and the ball is gone and on target. Thought the Pack might lose this one and glad they had the talent and skill to pull away. I really do hope they don't screw up Fields by expecting too much from him or getting him killed as he looks special.
13:08 OMG HE SOLD THAT FADE SO WELLLLLLLLL , JESUS
Chicago, your owner said to change Willis Tower to Rodgers Tower. He'll be there first thing in the morning
anyone notice on minute 6:48 adams hits photographer with the ball
4-9 😔 Ngl I feel like my bears will finish 4-13 even with an easy schedule coming up.
6:40 is a perfect example of the new NFL. #4 of the Bears could have blown Adams up & separated him from the ball. He chose otherwise. Probably had fines & suspension on his mind…. And I’m a Packer fan lol.
Rodgers is a football god
As a Packers fan I never take the Bears lightly.
3:30 holy that is the greatest fake I’ve ever seen 😦
Bears really won the game. They got cheated out of two touchdowns
Fields was impressive all night long Bears got a QB now
Way higher scoring than I expected.
That "fake fade to quick slant" route by tae adams was nice
Great effort by Fields, he might make for a franchise quarterback in time!
I cannot for the life of me understand why people think Fields is any good. The announcers say he had a pretty good game; how? He fumbled the ball yet again and has 10 fumbles for the year now in 10 games. He threw 2 more INTs and now has 11 for the year in 10 games. Even in this game if you take away the 1 long YAC play Field's YPP is just a joke of check-downs and designed screen/ROP plays. Even with short fields and 18 points from the special teams Fields has proven time-and-time again he can't get the job done. Want to blame coaches; ok. Want to blame the OC; ok. But at what point can we call it what it is? Field's can maybe develop into a serviceable QB; however, since the Bears have proven in the last 2 decades that they cannot develop or coach-up any players that aren't true studs I don't really see it happening. Fields could be better than serviceable if he had the right coaches, the mental fortitude to not believe all the hype, the ability to play to his abilities rather than the abilities all the announcers and pundits say that he has, and if he could learn to read defenses and use his arm to bail himself out rather than his legs he would be a bigger threat. All of these are moot because he should NEVER have seen the field at all this season because he is SO FAR from being NFL ready.
Special Teams clusterf**k
This is a game where NFL Commissioner wants to see the league tank. The ref deliberately took the Bears out of the game and you can see by no call or the ob call on the muffed punt. This league will die in 5-10 years if something isn't done soon. That's first half was so Awesome that the game coulda went either way. Halfway through the 3rd, you can see it in the players motions that they barely cared. Plays moved a lot slower and blatant calls got missed. XFL, please come back!!!
This was horrible defense from everyone. Lots of scoring, so it’s “fun” to watch. But not good football.
That punt returner needs to learn how to catch a ball. Looked like he was clapping for a putted birdie in golf
I just came here to watch fields fall down again from that pick 6 😂😂😂
The most important thing I took from this game was Matt Nagy wore a knitted cap instead of the stupid visor he normally wears.  Matt FINALLY understands he represents Chicago and we don't wear visors here.  Thank you Matt for this small victory.
Da special teams will be the reason they lose again in da playoffs
They changing that can’t advance it rule next season
As a Packer fan, I always liked Allen Robinson but I think the Bears is better off not using him for the rest of the seasons. Seems like he's done in Chicago
No one gonna talk about how fast grant was on that play boy looked faster then Hill @2:33
Man, Packers special teams sucked in this game🤦🏿‍♂️
Can someone explain "they can't advance it" on the onside/punts? I honestly have never heard of the term before and I'm curious what it means. Thanks!
Mark my words: special teams will lose us the NFC championship
But bears need to clean house ngl
what a bullcrap call on the running out of bounds. he was forced out and he took two steps to get back in bounds. some would say a bad call, others would say just part of the games plan, goodell has turned the nfl into the wwf, just an entertainment industry where the outcomes are predetermined. you make the call.
Cmon man that was a terrible call.. I don't usually blame refs but that call was awful he ran out of bounds lmao cmon man he came right back in
This game was bonkers lol
: bears up by 10   :Aaron Rodgers  snap back to reality
Thats what you get for mocking the belt 😂😂😂
I said it During the draft that Fields would be the best QB in this draft class. I would have taken him second overall.
Great exciting game! At 14:15 I reckon Chicago might as well have faked the kick and gone for either a 1st down or touchdown. They were that far behind that kick didn't really matter - might as well take the chance. Correct me if I'm wrong.
Every time Quinn has done the discount double check celebration, the Bears have lost 🥴
Once again an official has to throw the game in the favor of one team. See time line 12:10
Man what's up with amari Rodgers like
Why couldn’t the Bears get a win fueled off of. Hate for being owned!?!?? Aaron Rodgers please retire or go to another division next year…tired Bears fan
4:30 fell down.... rigged
Go Pack Go!
Jakeem grant couldn’t do this shi in Miami 😐
Go  packers Go👍💚👍
6:48 camera man was probably happy about that 😂
GO PACK GO!!
The Packers are fortunate to have such a productive offense because their defense still gave up 30 points to the Bears.
Fields is not much of a passer.   He runs good, but the best quarterbacks are those that have an arm.
Packers Special Teams:  😴💤💤🛌🛌😪🥱
People think Aaron Rodgers is so smart but he plays football
Justin fields sucks as a lightskin from Ohio state
I'm having fun.
Bears in the first half:😃 Bears in the second half:💀
Fields deserves a little more credit for the things he does with the ball.
Two VERY questionable calls against the Bears may have cost them the game. I'm not a particular Bears fan, but the officiating this season has sucked once again. I feel bad for Fields, who played a tremendous game. But, Rogers and the Packers adjusted to the ferocious Bears defense by running a very BIll Walsh short passing and running game after Rogers got put under huge pressure and sacked several times. It was a great game marred by the officiating.
10:14 WHAT A BLOCK
The Chicago WTFs'
Man being a bears fan, the only thing I can really be mad at now is Nagy and our secondary. Like some of the play-calling and the secondary making some stupid decisions. I know Rodgers will be an all-time great and all that, and I know he can see things in the secondary that others can't but, COME ON, this was just bad. People were saying the Packers' ST was bad, well so was the secondary for the second half.
Grant may be the fastest person to ever step on a football field
Packer's special teams folks need a few extra reps - what a night. Green Bay was lucky to win that game.
Rodgers vs cry brady and the refs wouldn't know who to help more..
0:42  Never mock the belt.
Crazy game
Special Teams coach should get 30 lashes
Lmao they still can’t get past the nfc championship so what does it matter
Bears special teams, and DL took over this game. too bad they dont want to be fired by the team owner
packers team is a kick ass machine.....this championship is ours...i'm a big brazilian fan ...yellow and green is the top....
Great game GB. Special teams though... Looked like they were playing for Chicago...
Hands down the worst special teams performance I’ve ever seen
WE STILL OWN YOU CHICAGO
We got f*cked out of 2 touchdowns 😪
3:29 what a fake
that rule is dumb asf!!
Special Teams 😭
The packers muffed a punt and got rewarded for it… I can’t believe it. That penalty should never have happened.
It was a great first half Bears, but like 2018, can't sleep on Aaron Rodgers... 2023 will be an interesting year for the Bears, I'm hoping it will be a completely different management from top to bottom.
So Rodgers wasn’t lying when he said he owns the bears 🤦🏽‍♂️😂😂😂😂😂
What's that covid19 carrying idiot rogers doing still playing football? Nfl you need to punish that idiot.
Great game Jakeem Grant from a Dolphins fan. Looks like the Bears figured out that special teams and trick plays are the way to use him.  Dolphins tried to make him WR2 for years.
The 2010 Chargers would be proud.
This would have been a really exciting game but the refs ruined it.
They need to get rid of the no advancing rule. If that didn’t exist this game would have been so much better.
At 13:12 #33 got his ankles taken for trying to cover Adams. The release was to much.
I have no affiliation with either the Bears or Packers...but for God's sake. Can the Bears beat these guys just ONE TIME. It's sad to watch
Someone explain to me how Fields had a good game.
We
That Adams touchdown at the end of the 1st half was absolutely FILTHY.
Best game this season
The moment they mock "the Belt" 0:42, they should know what will eventually happen to them.
Mista Rodgers say,"CHI TOWN, WHO YO DADDY?!!!🤣
My fav play from this game was the AR handoff fake that fooled everyone + camera man
How do we keep getting worse at special teams I like Crosby but he's older we need a new strong leg and these players too like wow
Go Pack Go.
Packers special teams might have given the worst performance I have ever seen. Lucky their have that powerful offense. If it was against a good team, this would be an L.
10:06 fields is by far the worst qb ever
Where did those 2 speedsters come from!! Wow! What a 1st half.
Aaron "Hold my Special Teams" Rodgers
bears gf when
When will players learn to stop mocking the belt? 🤦🏿‍♂️! 🧀
I don't care what anyone says, Bears deserved this one
I think that flag at 12:05 was kinda BS
GO PACK GOOOOOOOO
6:48  Davante Adams with precision no look pass...
Thanks Davante, keep it up👍🏻
Our d lit up in the second, but not in the first.
If your a Bears fan you gotta be happy with Fields progression. In my opinion he is the better rookie QB this year, Mac is just lucky he has Bill
Chicago bears vs green bay packers 2021 22 football al Michaels cris collinsworth Kathryn tappen
I am so damn proud of that young dude. Get  em Fields! This is not the year.
Aaron throw the ball so effortlessly
Enjoy your last season with Rodgers Packer fans. The Jordan Love era begins next season! Yay!!!
No one talking about Eric stokes locking down Darnell Mooney??? 1 catch the next Jaire possibly
Fields will never be a good QB!!!!!!!
How is Brady mvp over the Packers QB an cardinals ?
Worse Officials Ever!!! They wanted the packers to WIN clearly!!!!
Looking forward to that Aaron Rodgers interview on The Pat McAfee Show tomorrow!!! #ForTheBrand #PuntersArePeopleToo #PatMcAfeeShowLive
Have they not learned?  Don't mock the belt.
Rodgers still owns the Bears😂😂
As an Eagles fan I am glad to see Rasul Douglas is doing great in Green Bay, he has a lot of potential and the great plays are finally coming this year!!! Carolina missed the chance to keep a great corner on their roster
Love seeing a bears loss
Opposing players: my time to mock the belt. Mortal Combat: Finish him
0:41 don't mock the belt!
🧀
Aside from the Packers special teams stinkin' up the joint, I loved how they implemented heavy tight end in this game and Big Dog getting a lot of action. Also, that Dennis Kelly really stepped up in the absence of Billy Turner! Dude's a beast!
My Bears secondary needs a whole new look. New secondary plus Khalil and we super bowl bound. Offense is straight When we have our defense back we championship bound. Repeatedly.   Every since they parted with Lovie these coaches can’t beat GB. He was all about beating therm.
When oh when will Quinn learn, among others, not to mock the belt?
Bears Special Team > Bears offense
Bears should have won this one.  Worst special teams performance by the Wisconsin team I've ever seen.  Fields is getting better every week.  But as a Bears fan gotta look to the future and getting this roster better
When the belt was mocked I knew we had this in the bag even being down 10-0 and on that punt Douglas didn’t push him for a reason got a vet that wants to ball out got a badass from the streets to the stat sheets
Fields didn’t look horrible
how many miracles do the bears need to win a game this season? cause 5 apparently isn't good enough
I wish the Bears would actually field a team one day. Packers horrid special teams play and Grant made this one at least a little interesting at first. I was falling asleep in the 4th quarter. Not sure why this "rivalry" is even in prime time. I thought I never would get tired of the Packers whoopin the Bears ass but it's getting a little old lol
Y'all would had lost if Matt Nagy wast a terrible head coach
Rasul Douglas is insane
Question though… I really just got into football these past few years I watched it but never was really into it like I am now…  what do you consider a blow out lost to be? And would it be that same margin for playoffs?
Packers always choke in da playoffs and on top of that y'all did not own the bears remind y'all playing a rookie quarterback and think y'all just a beast known fact y'all supposed to beat the bears it's a no brainer
Go pack go!
Play action. I wonder if the Packers will keep it up? When there is no one in the backfield on a pass play Rodgers frequently gets pressured or worse. Wake up coaches!
Arron Rodgers trash do real
The first half was great and then That guy did (you know the guy) what he usually does to the Bears. Makes my eyes rain 🤣
Packers got lucky with the flags. Trashass team
Those Bears just can not stop getting penalties that screw them up, can they?
no ones going to talk about how unexcited and emotionless the announcers have been when GreenBay scores or does something positive?
Fire special teams coach
I now own the Packers...and the Bears....never thought I could own two NFL teams...Life Is Good!
BUT AARON IS THE LEADER,DONT FORGET,A MACHINR OF METHODICAL MOVES,HE LOVES GOD,AND CARRIES HIS TEAM AND HELPS HIS TEAM,AND WE WON,WE WON!!!!! GO GREENBAY PACKERS!!! HO MY KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOR AND HE GAVE THE OTHER TEAM EXTRA TO HELP THEM, WE WON WE WON!!!
NFL is trash.. the fan base is getting smaller and smaller.. people are seeing how corrupt it really is..
Felds got a Cannon!
Cant advance a muffed punt such a stupid rule
Justin Fields might be the worst QB the league has ever seen.
Too many times have I seen refs help the packers win games. This one is nothing different. Muffed punt return and the call is on someone not even part of the play. I’m neither a bears fan or a packers fan and the bears got screwed.
Why is no one talking about the punt return by Byrd?
The Rasual Douglass pick 6 brought back memory of Al Harris ot pick 6 vs Seattle in playoffs.  Forget the year but nice pick 6
Good game..bad special team plays
can amari rodgers learn how to efficiently catch a punt
News flash: the bears still suck
Malek whatever his name is is an idiot. How tf to u make a mistake like that at the 5 yrd line with no pressure? Helloooooo
The nfl is rigged folks
GB Top 5 Defense and Offensive , Division 1 high school special teams <- killed GB playoffs 3x before
As a packers fan , ima need everybody including offense to go through catching drills ALL WEEK ! S**t makes no sense how this was a game basically just off the packers not catching nothing lmao ..
rasul douglas was on the arizona practice squad and then the pack signed him and he has 3 picks; 2 of them pick-sixes
Remember when Rodgers leaves,  Matt Lefleur is going to be exposed, this is the packers last year of dominance in the nfc north
Packers special team coach before the game: ok boys to make it interesting we are not doing tackles today. Oh, and make sure you drop a punt return and let them recover an onside kick. That way they might have a chance. Bears: *mock the belt and lose anyway*
The 2 calls the officials made against the Bears in the last quarter were just outrageous!!! It’s very difficult to have to fight on the field against a better team and officials favoring the better team 🤬
The Gospel: We sin against God and for our sins we deserve hell. We fall short of God’s perfect standard for heaven. But the good news is we have a way to be forgiven, that way is through Jesus. Because he loved the world, he came, lived a sinless life then died on the cross for our sins, paying the price for them which is death. He was buried and rose again on the third day. Because Jesus did this for us the gift of eternal life from God is offered to everyone. All we must do to be saved is put our faith in Jesus ✝️❤️.
I knew as soon as Nagy said “he was having fun” I knew the Bears were doomed.  Time to fire his ass, he’s holding them back.  4 years of nothingness.
We still own you!
It’s bad that as a Bears fan I love me some Rodgers? 😂😢
packer for superbowl champs 👍👍
What were those special teams?
Chicago, beat the Packers for once and *not* the Vikings. No point taking out the only Division rival who has been able to handle them at times the past 30 years.
Memo to Bears: there is two halves to a football game. That is all...
As a packer fan we got the win yes but are special teams has been awful overall this year and could be our worst enemy definitely heading into the postseason gotta get that ish together
what a game even as a fan of neither sides, although i did kinda of want Chicago to win
Well, at least one team I like won today.
Packers STILL OWN you bears!!!!!!!!
Doesn't matter. Rogers will be a Steeler next season. Mark this comment.
1:52 that flick and throw is just unreal....the arm strength
This was the most scripted game I’ve ever seen. My god the nfl doesn’t even try to cover it up anymore
Glad to say this was my first football game ever🙂
Douglas and Alexander on one side.. is gonna legit..
this was the ugliest 45 points I've seen. The Pack are going to have to do much better.
I can think that is okay
SO HAPPY ME PACKERS WON
Fields needs to work on his arm strength a lot.
I STILL still own you. Said Rodgers secretly.
Fire Nagy and find a coach that can tell the bears QB to settle down and stop trying to make flashy plays he deserved at least 5 picks
Pack special teams had a rough night... geez
Packers fans count your days it’s a matter of a few years if not just one more and Jordan love is your starting quarterback.
you can almost tell when the refs are going to throw a flag, just when the team they don’t want to win starts getting some momentum
When rodgers leaves or retires this organization with be nothing. They put garbage around him his whole career.
That boy Robert Quinn thick in the damn head. That’s like the 4th time he’s mocked the belt. Loses every time.
Scores 30 points against us and had nothing to show for it. Yup the bears STILL SUCK 😂 but special teams really needs to be addressed after that performance last night
Deguara not only has stepped up in the passing game, but as a lead blocker he may be the best on the team. Showed it before the injury last year, and has sneakily become one of the Packers most valuable assets. He's a utility guy, and a potential star in the making. I love watching him play, he doesn't get talked about nearly as much as he should.
Why can't you advance on an onside kick recovery?
the bears sideline looks like they got on akatsuki uniforms 🤣
Why was that onside kick return in the 4th QTR not a TD. Went off the defenders hands, right to Herbert and he stayed in bounds...?
Fields cost 2×top ten picks plus .... Gotta side with gruden on nfl getting back to draft on Merritt and rules of Merritt instead of eqauty like taunting is.
Can always count on packer's d-line and special team to make the opposing team look good...smh.
That special team sure did play like they were special...
Easy Division and still chokes in playoffs
The National Football League's oldest rivalry, between the G.B. Packers and the Chicago Bears, was renewed for the 2021-22 season, with the Packers defeating the Bears 24-14 at Soldier Field in Chicago during Week Six. Week 14, the Bears, visited Lambeau Field in Green Bay to complete their rivalry for the 2021-22 season. The second meeting between the Bears and Packers included many big plays and points on offense, defense, and special teams. The Bears and Packers combined for 45 points in the second quarter alone with the Bears building a 27-21 lead. The second-half of their second game would be a complete reversal for both teams. The Packers would outscore the Bears 24-3 in the second-half this game and cruise to a 45-30 victory and sweep the season-series for the third straight year in this historic legendary, long-running rivalry.
Green Bay special teams coach needs to be fired.
I pity the bears.  They were motivated.  They came to play.  They gave it all.  And still lost
NFL need to change the special teams punt and onside kick rules to make the ball live when touched by the receiving team. Bears would have had 2 clear TDs. Spoilt a good comeback IMO.
Special teams by GB was awful. All season it's been a problem. Otherwise i am happy with win. AROD = MVP. Go Pack Go.
Not a Bears or Packers fan.  Just wanted to watch a good football game.  Turned it off towards the end of the third quarter because the refs were on more than the players.
As a packers fan this was a good game I have to give it to fields
Never mock the belt
I miss  clay Matthews on the  Special teams
Rasul Douglas though! 🔥 💪🏼
How does it make any sense that on an onside kick, the receiving team touches the ball and you still can't advance it? It should be a live ball. Or a player runs out of bounds and doesn't touch the ball upon returning, nullifies and fumbled punt returned for a TD? The NFL has some stupid rules.
😂😂😂 Robert Quinn getting embarrassed the rest of the game. Mock the belt and you get exposed.
On a kick once the receiving team touches the ball isn't it a live ball?
To think that the pack still covered the spread
How'd mockin that belt work out 4 ya??
bears need to work on finishing games because they have allways had the lead and the defense allways sells
Rodgers was incredible last night. Packers special teams coach should be canned
Cmon 🐻 🐻‍❄
Knew the Packers were going to win when Rodgers got sacked and the guy mocked the belt
He hit him with the discount double check hahaha I cant stand Aaron Rodgers. Dudes ego is bigger than the entire football team. 1 super bowl win 10 years ago isnt impressive
Our special teams continues to amaze me every week
as an eagles fan who likes Aaron rodgers… im mad that they called back the muffed punt and onside kick for touchdowns
Caution Packer fans, Dallas is flying under the radar.
I'm glad the packers packed the bear meat away! Bears don't need to try to win against the packers. They won't.
These are the most special teams highlights I've ever seen from one game...
We really put the special in special teams this game
I give Aaron Rodgers all the credit he deserves but no one is talking about how awful the bears defense was. We need to beef up the secondary or get some better play calling. Another pathetic attempt at stopping your “rival.” This hasn’t been a rivalry for years, just an embarrassment.
If the bears gonna play cover 2 soft zone every down i know a couple high school quarterbacks that can throw 400 yards against them
LMAO they did the same thing! Sacked Rodgers, mocked the belt, then proceeded to get beat down.
Everyone here pretends they can always do it better, throw better, play better, coach better, lololol.... all from the comfort of their of their couch. Just stop complaining and be happy about the W
He mocked the belt and got wiped by the the belt🤣
Aaron Roger really owns the bears
Yo madden Jakeem Grant just called he want his 97 Speed and 95 acceleration back lol
I own you
As a UK Bear's 🐻 fan better than normal but god dam that boogyman Rodgers lol
as a bears fan, i’m not really even mad at this pint in the season. but justin fields not only showed great improvement but the special teams really shined. amazing first half and terrible second half but the offense played well regardless of the score.
What was wrong with the Special team  They wanted to lose the game
Robert Quinn: mocks the belt  Arod: ...and I took that personally (for like the 20th time)
At the half Matt Nagy said he was having fun with that lead. I wonder if he was still having fun during the rest of the game? You’re 4-8 punting on 4th and inches. Go for it, what else do you have to lose? If I was an owner I’d fire him for punting rather than punting and playing safe.
Bruh look at #65 @15:00 lmao dude literally getting slide back into Justin 😂😂😂😂 he can’t throw like dis
Who ever is number 17 on the bears he’s an monster 💯 he reminds me of tyreek hill
Little Herbert plays football? I thought he was a jockey.
Never seen players so wide open in my life.
The bears always find a way to disappoint me every game! Bear Down 🐻⬇️
How much entertainment do you want? SNF: "YES"
4-10 tells the story but the real reason they lost is because of Racism .. lol
respett
Packer fan right here that was a horrible game special teams was horrible, defense needs to step up on the pass rush even tho they won it was sloppy win.
At 42secs teams just don't get it 😒 don't mock the belt taunt it never ends well lol
Don't care about either team, but the Bears got screwed so bad this game.
The Packers put the special in special teams.
wow u cant advanced the ball after u recover kick off... Packers got lucky 2x.... oh well. Packers and Aaron Rodgers are going to choke to the Bucs in Playoffs
Hey Chicago maybe next year  you should take a quarterback in the first round from Penn State🥴 when  will you ever learn you lesson 🤦🏼‍♂️
The Bears look pretty good tonight..I think they got a great quarterback and they going to have a great future
🙏🏾✝️
He has always owned them
Special teams stayed screwing up. 🤨
Never mock the belt but its the 🐻 so they never learn
Man the officials stole the game away from chi
First Half Bears are a great team 2nd half Bears suck da Bears is Rogers sons
Rodgers still owns the Bears. If the DL doesn't get to him then this Bears secondary are useless in coverage and Rodgers can pick them off at will. Quinn and Roquan Smith are the only bright spots in a turgid defence this year. Open field tackling is a major issue, I've seen no stats but the yards conceded after first contact must be league high with this Bears unit.
They had us in the first half ngl…
There is nothing special about GBs special teams.....As an owner I am appalled in regards to their lack of effort.
https://youtu.be/xmvSTIWGqgI
We better get it together it’s now or never
This is the perfect example of how the NFL takes away so much fun from the game why they can't advance the ball? This game was set up to be a classic
How could you have a bad chemistry like this with a number one wr named allen robinson. Im sad for him fields cant push the ball down field. He dosnt read the field as best it should be. He need to improve. Great win by the packers ! They put the gas in the third quarter
I wonder when Quinn is going to learn to stop mocking the belt celebration.
I was at the game and wow what a crazy game. We also needs a new Special Teams coach.
Rogers might be the best quarterback ever .
Lazard was looking real nice. Love to see it. Dude can be an absolute weapon.
Marshall Horne w
Why tf was grant looking like prime Devin Hester 👀😭😭
That punt recovery for a touchdown & that onsides kick recovery for a touchdown -- both called back shows blatant corruption
Heres the thing, we all take special teams for granted, its not the most exciting thing to see during a game.  However, that performance the packers gave on special teams last night was abysmal and if a team like Chicago who is pretty bad takes the mistakes and keeps the game close, a team like Tampa is going to smoke Green Bay.
Fields played well. Clean up a few int and decision making butnaside from that he's improved. He'll only get better
Douglas is nastyyy
Bears never should have mock the belt.  They should know better.  *Waggles finger*
If are special teams plays good from now on we’re going to win every game
Vince rolled over in his grave during the full punt return!!!
NEVER MOCK THE BELT
This game is proof a good QB can make up for mistakes.
Great game Love to see them boys out there having fun🧀🧀🧀💚💛
When a NFL highlight video is longer than 9 minutes you know it was a great game
Slow starts by the Pack have to stop.. Good try by the Bears.. but the Packers are way better than this!! You don't make it to super bowls by playing half assed! Pack better step it up..
That flag on the muffled punt was ridiculous 🙄
Justin Fields is still raw and makes rookie mistakes, but this kid is learning the game; it is slowing down for him. He will be a super star in this league in the next 2-3 years. The Bears have struck gold with this young man.  I'm a Vikings fan, but I have to say congratulations  to the Chicago Bears! You took a chance on picking Fields early in the draft and it paid off big-time!
Rodgers owns the bears
Both teams are garbage but somebody had win it.
Been saying it for weeks now. Fire the special teams coach. They are a liability on the field right now and we will lose to better teams than the Bears if we keep this up.
Where was this Rasuel Douglas on the Eagles
Rip to all the bettors on the spread with all of those special teams gaffes lol
12:55 aaron point the way
If u listen carefully, you can still hear the Bears fans bitching about Collinsworth and Michaels. Lmao, How dare they speak so highly off the defending MVP?!? Lol. I get it Bears fans, i guess ya gotta be mad at someone...
Fields sucks. Worst young QB in draft.
Not sure how you recover a kick 2 different times for touchdowns and still get no points both times.
103-95-6 Packers ( 45-30 Green Bay )
I’ve never seen a better special teams performance by a team that basically didn’t count because reasons.. Bears had two touchdowns taken away.
That last TD by Adams was filthy. Faked the fade and went slant. Just filthy.
Yuhhh
Our special teams was selling the bag. If it wasn’t for those calls, we would’ve lost. Also don’t mock the belt. That’s how you piss Aaron off
This did not look good for the brand.
Brady "hold my beer".
Fields plays football in such an unorthodox way... this was such a weird game. Anyone know why the touchdown off the onside kick didn’t count?
Thank god adams went the hell off!
Special teams coach needs to go...also need a kicker who can kick the ball out of the end zone.  Pitiful special teams play...same thing every week.
Green Bay special teams wants to get cut -.- wow
The thing that is so mesmerizing about their poor special teams play is that this isn't a scheme issue- this is players just flat out mentally messing up.  The muffed punts, the onside kick recovery, those are mental errors.  The fact that it just kept happening is freakin' weird.  On the other hand, the Packers offense/defense was about as solid as it gets.  You know come playoff time they're gonna be putting in veteran/ higher level talent in those key special teams positions.  They can't afford to have it cost them a game when it's one and done.
National Political Hacks League
Justin fields can only do so much
Rodgere slang that ball like no other it's so pretty leaving his hands
Troy Aikman and Joe Buck are the biggest Packer haters and it shows
What a game!
Well i gotta say my Bears fought more in this game than they have all season. Rodgers is just that guy. Like jeez 🤣🤣🤣 But i love Justin. Justin will be ready for the fights next year. Nagy gotta go though
Wow NFL 6 adds in 2 minutes
Wtf would u mock the belt smh 🤦🏽‍♂️
always WIN ❤😁
The Bears mocking the belt, was like Japan letting America enter WW2
There's nothing special teams about Green Bay 🤣🤣🤣 It's the rivalry go Bears!
Adam’s move at 6:41 was insane
Bitcoin to the moon! bears still suck!
putting the special back into special teams
Bears had a lot of big plays in this game & still lost
Sucks we lost but the bears really have their franchise quarter back and this game showed that.
Justin fields did everything he could its not his fault his receivers suck
Help me out - why didn't the onside kick play at the end result in a touchdown?
Special teams literally is the worst in the league by a fat mile!
This was bad coaching on the bears If they would of set the pace ran the ball when they had the lead they wouldnt of showed matt everything they had in the first half by that time matt saw every play they had for fields and remember this is aaron Rodgers making u Bullet slant passes fields got exposed the 2nd half
Cairo santos
Why do other teams mock the belt like you just don’t do that
Got to take the victory But man special-teams is becoming a problem
14:24 how is this not a TD?
nfl needs to change that stupid rule.  The other team should be able advance a muffed punt and onside kick. Thats the most stupid rule Ive seen. not fan of either teams just a nfl fan watching highlights.
Justin Fields played his ass off I don’t care what you say
This was the worst perfomance from a special teams perspective I have ever seen
Bears vs Packers is definitely not a rivalry.
Matt Nagy came out in a press conference to remind people that Aaron Rodgers owns the Bears, and Matt came out to perform like his job depended on it. Hopefully Aaron keeps Matt around. He's a really good coach for the Packers organization.
Da Bears...
I didn't even know a punt return was possible anymore without some laundry, but here come the Packers. They really gotta figure something out.
Justin fields looks slow in the pocket
Climate crisis > football
That out of bounds call was some BS must be about Vegas or NY again $$$
My birthday is today can I get a happy birthday 🙏🏾💯#2️⃣2️⃣ #gpg💚💛💚💛
Aaron Rogers toe doesn't need surgery he's just lying like he lied about his vaccination for covid-19. Narcissistic psychopaths will always lie about anything, and everything to distract from the truth.  Remember over 74 million morons voted for another narcissistic psychopath to be their dictator over them. They all suffer from a very serious mental health issue called Narcissistic Personality Disorder(NPD), and blame others for their actions, and decisions, instead taking responsibility themselves.
Why you can't advance those two plays kills me inside. It makes for amazing football we all want to watch
trubisky > rodgers.  no debate
They need to change that rule that you can't advance onside kicks punt fumbles and field goal blocks the nfl is corny
Bears always disappoint me when it comes to the packers
Can’t stand the bears but they need better coaching they were in this game packers d made some plays but this could have gone the other way.
Looked like Hall from the chief’s back in the day on that nice return ❤️❤️❤️
Rodgers Tuesdays is gonna be good
Quinn will never learn, he was already in the "mocking Rodgers and regretting it" video 2 times... he just added to it 🤣
Fields look good Nagy al,AL, out the door good bears loss
Fields look good Nagy almost out the door good bears loss
Not part ownership...... FULL OWNERSHIP!!
Bears got some very underrated RBs, TEs and WRs. Just need to be used better.
I’m a packers fan but special teams was something else last night 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
What a fun game to watch. Really excellent football by both teams.
Fields is a bust
Karen Rogers
Aaron Rodgers still owns you.  Although I give you a little credit.  You made him work for it.
That first half was like a full game.
Bears 44  Packers 45
Or special teams is retarded and I’ve been saying this throughout the season, not just this game
I’m a packers fan. Crazy and entertaining game. fields has the potential to make us miserable for years to come. Special teams get it together 😞. I lost it and went to bed at the half. Glad to see that pulled off a win but maaannn. Our division always plays so tough against each another.
GB special team were paid off or something 😂
hmmm seems every team this week was having ST problems fishyyyy
Can I tell you all something?              You can’t advance it 😝
You mock the belt your gonna have a bad time
As a bears fan i didn't watch the game. But when i seen the scoreboard i knew we weren't the ones that scored 45 lol
I have nightmares about our special teams losing it for us in the playoffs, it is reoccurring
Grant doing his best Devin Hester impression!!
1:54 *MOSSED!!!*
Same Packer squad for decades.  Poor tackling, can't stop a running QB bouncing out, special teams sucks, secondary poor in the first half.  I did see one horse though, that fullback/running back.  Still, it's Rodgers team.  Meaning, he doesn't give a sh.. about his defense; he plans on putting 40 on the scoreboard. That's great, until you don't get 40.  F him.
Every is riding Tom Brady thinking they going all the way .Well y'all wrong Aaron Rodgers is going all the way the Packers will win NFC championship there is no team that is more consistent than the Packers Aaron Rodgers is so smart and talented he can beat you with no weapons and Adams is the best wide receiver in the NFL he will get the MVP award he is very consistent So fk Brady old ass
Trubisky >>>>>> Fields
Fields isn’t a real QB. He needs a lot of trick plays & runs to be competitive. Notice he is avg when he throws that INT.
Special teams is their biggest glaring issue!  Tackling is a close second.  Other than that, Go Pack GO!!!!
What I find hilarious, is the Bears actually gave up a first round draft pick to go up in the draft for Justin Fields. Andy Dalton is literally twice the QB Fields will ever be. Fields is more athletic and able to scramble, but he doesn't have the QB IQ or accuracy Dalton has. At best Fields is a poor man's RG III or Lamar Jackson. He really needs to work on his accuracy, mechanics, and ability to read NFL defenses.
Can’t believe they didn’t include the Kurt Benkert highlight at the end
6:48
If you run out of bounds, you have to come right back in. He did. Still a penalty. Still Packers favoritism by refs. But still. What a game!
Man this game was flat out damn crazy , even tho Aaron Rodgers “still owned the Chicago Bears” what the hell did the special teams even do for Green Bay ? It’s probably one of the all time worst performances I’ve seen on the field from them , and like u don’t even stop a bears offense that’s like almost dead last in the League ? 🤦‍♂️
Douglas is a beast !!!
That number 17 for the bears is dangerous
Those 2 plays , the bears got robbed
The 2nd qtr was fun to watch
If I see another gronk commercial......
I am looking forward to seeing Fields the next years.
We got cheated outta 14 points tf
So when r the bears gonna change coaches?
They really need to cut down on Bears games in primetime already.
Bears grant is really good tho
Justin Fields is such a Superstar! He will be the best QB in the NFL very soon!!!
i know they’ll be working on pursuit drills all week, they missed close to every single angle
teams gotta learn that when you mock aaron’s discount double check, bad things happen to you
Aaron is Nikola Jokic of the NFL
Mock the belt get beat. Bears haven't figured that out yet. Still own you. Go Pack go.
I still love the Bears despite the record. Mr. Fields played very well. We should have won this game. Green Bay got lucky. I got a feeling Green Bay's special teams will cost them in the playoffs.
Fields is crap..so are all the bears
As a Packers fan, hearing "you can't advance it" twice on Special Teams is a killer
I feel like we do this every with Green Bay. Yes you will win the division, yes at some point everyone will think, "is this the year?" And of course no you wont even make it to the super bowl let alone win it, sorry.
Bruh...GB sucks
스페셜팀 아니었으면 패커스의 압도적인 경기였을듯
Does GB have a special team?
Bogus penalty, game was rigged for the packers, ridiculous
I OWN YOU.
Ya gotta wonder what's up with Packer speical teams; they stink out the joing with some regularity.
First half was open house on both sides. Green Bay was the first to run the clock in the second half. Chicago O-line collapsed again in the second half. Way to much pressure on Fields there. Defense collapsed in the second half, too. That's an old habit which goes back to at least Cutler........
"Do not mock the belt"
I'm a Packers fan and of course am glad they won.  What I don't get is why one can't advanse the ball on onside kicks and muffed up punts.
Aaron Rodger still own the bears
Packers will never win another super bowl with Aaron
If not for that bogus penalty on the muffed punt, the Bears could have won this game.  11:52 he came right back into the field of play. Bogus penalty.
Poor camera guy at 6:48. Devonte dirty for that lol
12:06 cmon butterfingers
LMAO at 6:47 when adams scores, he throws the ball behind him and hits the camera man in the face HAHAHAHAHA
Packer winning all this year argue with ya momma🗣🧀🧀🧀🧀
Every time I watch my BEARS play GB it's like big bro taking my stuff😠😡 still...gotta respect the great AROGERS & our JFIELDS will ONLY get better every game! BEARS BEARS BEARS FOREVER IN MY BLOOD NO MATTER WHAT!!
The Bear's receivers have to make those catches. Coaches used to say "you get a hand on it, you best catch it!"
0:40 to the sack shows the putting on the belt keep doing that and he going keep upsetting you 😂😂
Enjoying Packers dominate Central again. While I can. Soon we'll be the team with no QB. It's been fun. Not looking forward to playing Fields regularly without Rogers.
Packers horrendous special teams made the game seem more interesting than it actually was. The Bears are exactly who we thought they were.
Explain to me why the dolphins decided to get rid of what appears to just be the flat out fastest human being ever
When special teams of GB continue to "perform" like that, Rogers must be afraid to score as it brings up special teams next!
Justin Fields throws 2 interceptions, Passing Yards Not many.. He is not playing NFL caliber football..
Taunt with the belt, get spanked by Aaron Rodger' belt.
The referee cheating and bad calls are out of control...this is becoming a bad product.
6:39 what a beautiful pass 😍🪄
💛💚
GB is the usual. A quarterback who does a ton of TV commercials, gets lots of press, needs to be in the spotlight constantly, actually plays rather well but just can't put together more than one Superbowl Championship. Does it make Rodgers overrated? Yeah. Most definitely. Prediction: They will never win another Superbowl with Aaron Rodgers.
11:51 they need to define “getting right back in”. I don’t see anything wrong with this play. He got back in as soon as he could. WTF? Terrible call
Menos mal la burra es manza
A.J. Dillon works like a monster plough. Impressive, unstoppable. What an asset he has become - wow!!!
Defense: D Special teams: F  Side note: on the first sack on Rodgers, the DB did a “double-check” mock and Rodgers didn’t make him pay.  I take it back…HE DID!
They still don't learn.... do not mock the belt....
2 Td was taken from the bears 😊😉
Why was that onside kick return by herbert not a touchdown? you can´t advance the ball? just for a better understanding of the rules.
Justin fields is looking good, he just needs some support on his offense
Why did quinn have to do the belt celebration? Doesnt he know the stats
Discount double check on that sack was epic... LMAO
The Packers special teams kept this one much closer than it should have been!
Not pretty, but a W.
Rodgers still 🔥
Ridiculous, somebody wants Rodgers in the Playoffs way too much. Refs were morons in this one.
Wow, Arron Rodgers does own the Bears!! That running game and those little short passes Arron does worked. Packers kept nibbling down the field.
I think cam Newton will be a great qb for the bears next year..
Fields has that awkward jump throw that goes 3 feet above the receiver's head.
Packers special team did a heck of job keeping the Bears in this game
It’s such bs you can’t advance a muffed punt or onside kick.
Why do they insist on mocking the belt. When has that ever not ended in disaster? #Owned
Crazy game but good w Green Bay ain’t done yet
Bruh why do the bears and lions even exist
Aaron rodgers is the worst owner his team  loosing almost every week.. 🤷
No intensity on special teams, you got to make the tackles and fight for the ball. If I were Matt Lefluer I would be having punt return drills all week, on receiving and defending
Man, the Bears could have won, but they imploded as usual..... They couldn't win even if they played some Pop Warner kids......
Gb special teams....multiple huge kickoff returns, a onside kick given up, the longest punt return td in packers history...😔😔😔
Thank goodness the Packers play the lions, bears, and vikings twice a year.  Way overrated
Hey,Chicago Quarterback throw the ball no good I think he should do a lot of meditation you know what when you’re nervous or scared you don’t throw the ball good defense are not really good Packer running back went trough  defense .they spend money less than Chicago bears  we know what is important to do the team number 1 quarterback almost everything smart play thrown the ball good and strong heart another number 1  is team work good technique reliable
*our special teams sucked ever since our gunner, Jeff Janis left*
The Bears got robbed
*those throws to lazard and Jones over the finger tips of defenders are FREAKIN AMAZING and probably almost impossible to do for anyone not name AARON RODGERS.*
These condensed games prove the the "color commentators " aren't needed
2:19 just missed a holding call lmfao. Like how is that not called, would have been tackled for loss. Not biased, but the NFL refs are just ass this year.
The Bears forgot there are 4 quarters to a game not 2.
Chicago BEARS 30 vs 45 Green Bay PACKERS
"Hello, Halas Hall? I'd like to speak to Aaron Rodgers, please... Yes, I know he plays for the Packers, but I was informed that he owned the Bears."
First half was actually interesting. Then I remembered we played the bears
Bears had us in the first half ngl… 😂😂😂
Fields sucks
Fan of neither teams, but some questionable calls IMO on a few plays . Great game tho.
As a Niner fan I hate everything about Greenbay.
Let’s go packers
A Rod stake of the bears has now gone up to 80% 😂
How many pick sixes does Douglas have sheesh my boy is going off this season !
I still own you -Aaron Rogers
It's official Aaron rodgers is the owner of bears.
Love my Bears we coming♍️.LOOK OUT.🥷🏽🥷🏽
I knew it was over the second bears mocked that belt celebration.
1000 yards of total yards gained in 30 degree weather oh NFL I love your rigged games. It's entertaining to watch.
0:42 what?! No taunting call?! Cannot believe my eyes!
Aaron is so smooth
Wait! Why can't you advance it?
They got a stud in #17
THAT GAME WAS FANTASTIC!!! MY GOODNESS! 🤯
Mr. aaron rogers backtoback MVP ladies and gents!! Bow thankyou
Today was a lesson in obscure special teams rules. There's was a game earlier where if punter kicks a ball and it lands in bounds at the 2 yard line and its going to roll to a stop in bounds if the receiving team can touch the ball with a foot out of bounds it counts as a punt out of bounds and its placed at the 40 yd line 🤷‍♀ ANd then this game where you apparently can't advance an onside kick ....never heard of that before🤷‍♀and I knew about the rule where on special teams if you step out of bounds you have to immediately get back in bounds.... which seemed to happen here.... but I guess you can't do it fast enough so its always a penalty 🤷‍♀. I guess those are the rules but damn it took the fun out of a shoot out game
6:48 reply when you see it
Aaron may own the Bears but Green Bay’s special teams seem to owe them something
Special teams got owned this time, wow GB how you do that without it being on purpose? Wouldn't want to be in special teams practice this week ijs
that Aaron Rodgers fake was Goated tho
Who knew our special teams were so bad
I wanna witness a lambeau leap
0:42 why did you do that😢
I will put my life savings on our special teams costing us in the playoffs down the line, absolutely horrific performance
Dude this was fixed.
Can someone explain the “no advancing”  when they kicked the onside kick & they touched the ball & didn’t get a hold of it
Shouldn't be able to mock that celebration unless you got a title
The Bears had 2 tds that didn’t count that would’ve won them the game. SMH
One of the few times where you win by 2 touchdowns but would be completely justified in firing a coach the next day
Rodgers coming to collect the rent from CHI
Ref ball...
LOL who owned who now? Bears owned AR in his own home! Sacked lunch?  Dont say you own a team if it takes that much effort to beat them and you get sacked like that's your job!
Someone list all the Packers stars not playing.
mocking the Rodgers belt in the first quarter is a death wish
That “you can’t advance it” is a goofy rule. Doesn’t matter the teams. That rule is stupid.
My Packers Special Team was out there playing for the Bears instead of playing for there own team
Love this game! :) Aaron Rodgers beat Bears.  22-6!!! 😎
You can lose, but why beat yourself?   Never understand some teams.  Bears were a good team too; in ‘85??
Robert Quinn mocked the belt and that’s why the bears lost
I so hate when we do so many things amazing then negate it with a blown coverage in a sec.   Good game doe! GO BEARS
Our special teams did so bad but we still pulled off the win
Rodgers still owns the Cubs!!!!!!
damn some of those Bears players have video game speeds
The refs dusting off the rule book for this game 🤨
Wtf was that call. The officiating is getting worse and worse. No accountability.
Bears definitely could’ve won this game for sure if their defense wasn’t so bad. lol.
Celebrating interception on 4th down when you only brought your team backwards? Awesome.
Only the bears mock the belt then give up a 3rd and 18 near the Packers own end zone. Well maybe my dolphins...who wasted Grant in miami
That packers pecial team is looking not so special.
A whole lot of GB players went to Vegas and betted themselves to lose the game. Fortunately, Rodgers is a man of his word, he owns the Bears!
Congratulations to the Packers! Go Pack Go!
Robert Quinn: *Sacks A-Rod and mocks the Championship Belt taunt* Rodgers: "You must've forgotten who your owner is..."
Can someone explain the call on Herbert for the onside kick? Looked good to me. What does he mean he can't advance it? What was the call??
I pity the poor bastard handing out refreshments at GB's next special teams session...
GPG 💚💛💚💛💚💛💚💛💚💛💚💛💚
Nagy pre season : "We have too many cornerbacks. I will cut all the good ones. " Opponents :  The Bears secondary is a sieve.
Go Pack Go 😀
Not bad for having Rookie QB and a Garbage coach Chicago.
Well....we all knew how this was gonna end. Greenbay owning the bears per usual 🥱.
Packer fans going to be crying for ever after Rodgers leaves he can’t wait to leave Wisconsin
Refs vs bears again
Why do they keep ruining these videos by spoiling the winner in the thumbnail?
YES! The bears still SUCK!!!!
Da 🐻 still suck....haha
Seem like the calls are so bias toward the packers
The bears really thought they were gonna do something
Bears dead on arrival...
DA BEARS STILL SUCK
Never do the belt.
Rodgers MVP
Fire the special teams coach immediately!!!! #FUspecialteams
LET'S Go BEAR'S
Rasul Douglas 💪🏽(former eagle)
Not a Bears fan but NFL needs to change the rules on returning the ball on onside kicks and muffs. Those was clean 😂🔥
That’s muffed punt penalty was horrible
🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️Packer for life, but........... special teams played like "special" children..... #CarryOn
Packers are very impressive. If Packers play NE in SB, I want see Packers put 50 on them. Cowboys, Cardinals, Bucs have no chance vs Packers.
That offensive package the Packers came out with in the 2nd half was nutz
Our special teams got destroyed tonight.  I'll take the win over "Da Bears" but it could've been a lot cleaner.
The bears offensive line is trash
Fire the Bears ownership!
I was there my first game loved it .. go pack go
Why was the onside kick bear's TD denied by the ref? I genuinely don't know. As much as I love Packers to win, the "out of bounds call" (which I find dubious) plus this one would have made the game even (but with a mocked belt still having 1'20 to make a drive...). Awful special team on this one.
Rasul Douglas is so good
I haven’t seen the Packers’ Special Teams look this bad since they let the Patriots RG of all people return a kickoff to their 4 yd line.
I'd say the Bears took a great leap from the previous weeks. Great team play overall, but some of those calls on special teams really hurt. Even though they lost, the Bears looked pretty damn good this game.
tHe BeLt
11:23 was hilarious.
Still own you lol
*If the receiving team touches a on side kick and the kicking team gets the ball AFTER it's touch by the receiving team, the ball should be advanced if the kicking on side player is not tackle. I've seen on side kicking receive teams recover the on side kick and run the ball into the end zone for a TD, that should apply to the on side kicking team. [I might be wrong in my analogy but not being able to advance a recovered on side kick AFTER it's touch by the receiving team rule needs to be changed].*
This game was a tie… Bears won the first half… the Packers won the second....
AJ is a beast
Please release Jordan Love and sign Justin fields he is an animal
good job packers
Fields is horrible. I don't get why people keep saying he is a franchise QB for my Bears. He's worse than Trubisky.
Two questionable throws...but jeepers that youngster Fields is gonna be a star !...WOW !! a very entertaining slugfest !
What a crazy game glad we came back & won it
I started to watch this game on NBC because it's the only mainstream network I can get over the airwaves in my rural area but I turned off my TV when the first commercial was for Pfizer telling me how the drug company is making my life normal again. Orwellian messaging.
Still owns the Bears.
I DO NOT CARE HOW SPECIAL ROB GRONKOWSKI  IS IM FREAKING DONE WITH THOSE ADS
worst special teams performance of the decade.
America has, as a people, through their elected and appointed representatives, said to Christ, “Go away. We would not have you rule over us.” The shambles of a civilization that we are looking to pass on to our grandchildren are therefore a shambles created by the godless, for the godless. And what is the destiny of any town, nation, culture, or civilization that rejects Christ? What is their future?
Aaron Rodgers meant it when he said "I own you" to Bears fans😁 I mean damn what a game but the bears got a future ahead of them if they keep playing high level football 👍
Our special team sux
I really hope no deaf people ever have to rely on these absolute trash subtitles.
Like how do you not double team Adams!!?? HOWWW!!!??
Robert Quinn has mocked the belt like 4 times. And has paid the price 4 times because of it. Does this man not learn from his mistakes? 😂😂
Mitchell that played for the Eagles owns that belt.
If I'm coach and special teams pulls that in playoffs you will never be known in Greenbay everrrrrrrrrr again
Since when can’t you advance an onside kick?
Keep mocking the ducking belt and Aaron will make you pay every time
Yall see devonte adams throw the ball at the cameraman at 6:47?
Knew the Bears were doomed after they mocked the belt.  Not just once, but TWICE
lmfao!! chicago got so robbed!! once again!!...the refs bail out the cheese!! it's a joke at this point, & should be a meme by now...cuz its obvious! & everyone outside wisconsin can see it! i'm not even a bears fan!!
Packers cheated that game😡😡😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
Bears 😂 did the belt and meet there match 😂🤣like everyone who mocks the belt
Put on an Offensive clinic after the half! Dillon is a beast!
Wit until they play the Bills.
Can somebody explain this "You can't advance the ball..." rule that seems to have screwed the Bears a bit? Seems odd.  You recover kick, you score touchdown.
State Farm called Aaron Rodgers during half time and told him "they mocked the belt, THEY MUST PAY, make it so".
I'll say it again... the pack, are  not superbowl ready because they can not stop anyone from scoring heavily upon them. thats the problem.  a team with a QB that can score, and they are done.
1. Fire Nagy now 2. The first 16 years of my life the Bears vs Packers rivalry was utterly tilted in the Bears direction. In the 80s the Lions were the most serious threat.  The last 30 years I can "depend" on the Bears to win about 1 game every 3 years. Funny how 30 years of HoF caliber QB play does that. It is funny how much that changed, but also serves as a reminder to Packers fans that a return to mediocrity may be lying in wait for you as well once Rodgers is done. 3. The result was not unexpected though. Thus why I bet $500 on GB +the over 43.5 despite being a Bears fan.  I hope to see times where that isn't as sure of a bet as it has been. Until then I'll make thousands of dollars.
These rules are corny. They took 14 points from the bears because of these outdated special teams rules😤 game would've been even better. Eagles fan...
Good ass game go pack go
That onside kick recovered robbed us of Our boy Kurt Benkert play time.
Who ever can say Rodgers has never had great support? Geez. Dillion, Jones , Adams, etc. Monster weapons.  No excuses. He’s just not a finisher and team guy like Brady. Too much money sunk in him alone.
Fields is gonna be nice once he gets a real head coach. But damn packers did you pick up a bunch of random people off the street to play special teams today?
As a packers fan I’m concerned with fields destroying my packers after like 2 years.
When will players learn not to mock the belt do anything else from a packers fan😂 Special teams tho disgusting, but whats new🤦🏾‍♂️
WHAT A COMEBACK FOR GREENBAY....CHI WAS UP BY 10 ALSO +12 SPREAD. HURRRRAAAHHHHH PACKERS.
NFL & SPORTS WORLD NEEDS AARON AROUND ALWAYS & ALL THE TIME
am i the only one that think aaron rodgers looked like he was stoned his eyes were
If the special team had their heads in the game and not up their poop shoots this could have been a 40 to 9 smack down. Next week they'll be riding the short bus to the game.
Spec. Teams is the only thing tht is gonna hold Green Bay back. 12 is jus too good
I don't get why Rodgers does the belt thing dude only got one ring in his whole career.. he's choked so much I think it's embarrassing for him to do that.. if he had 7 rings like Brady then yea I'd understand but bro you won one time and been a one hit wonder your whole career sit down...
I swear Justin fields is gonna be really good. Just needs a better head coach(fire naggy) and a better o line
Bears are one of the softest teams in the NFL
“Squirts out”- Al Michaels
04:21 ~ WOW! 🙂
As a Bears fan I refuse to watch past 8 minutes.
They didn't learn from the Bengals, when they mocked the belt.
0:45 he really just did the Rodgers belt thing
Gonna be a good bucs vs Packers playoff game
I'm disappointed that my Bears lost to the Packers today, but by the same token I'm also not surprised. We're horrible!
owned/
How can you not advance that onside kick?
Great First Half!!! Nuff Said!
The real hero of the game was the man mock the belt thank you
Further proof that Nagy ass is done in Chicago
I can't wait until Matt Nagy gets fired.
I wish my Lions drafted Fields instead of trading Matt for Goof.
I. Hate. The. Packers!
Bears vs Refs
I don't watch 🐻 games but Fields elusiveness is impressive kid got wheels.
Typical bear fans want to cry about the flag on the muffed punt that it was bullshit, but don’t want to admit that play shouldn’t of even happened because of a delay of game. I was looking for the flag before the ball was even kicked because it as punted at least 2 seconds after the clock already hit 0. 23-5 how does it feel i bet you all have excuses for each and ever loss.
Chicago who, where???
As a bears fan, when Robert Quinn did the belt, I knew we were done
Embearassing
Thats a hell of a drive there in the 4th by rodgers
Go pack go from 🇹🇷
Special teams was definitely SPECIAL 🤨
QBs that can run are cool. The problem is it makes it impossible for them go through progressions. Only a matter of time before an injury and they're never the same. Remember RG3? He was elite. Then boom. Look at Lamar Jackson. It's crazy.   Only way it could work is if your team drafts the top mobile QBs three deep that are runners. Plug and play. Imagine Jackson, Hill, Tebow lol. Go all out. Fields, Jordan Love, Hurts, Jackson,  all those guys. Hilarious. The likes of Maholms, Brady, Prescott, Stafford, pocket passers will win over the long term.
Chicago 4ta y pulgadas y no se la juegan 😡 Con esa mentalidad no se gana..de ese despeje les Yego una anotación y no se la dan por un castigo infantil ( un jugador se salió del campo )😡😡🤬
Man Robert Quinn always mocks the belt he really has some self destructive issues
Packers special teams is so bad, I almost thought Devin Hester was out there returning those kicks.
So many people already said what I was thinking about and wanted to comment on. Our kick and punt return teams were about as awful as rhey could get. Another fumble on a punt return. The ONLY saving frame the Bears penalty. Then on-side kicks with a %success% or what 3%, we FUMBLE THAT TOO!?!? The offense HAD to go B*LLS out because after every offensive score you had NO CLUE if special teams would blow another coverage and give the points right back! This was SAD! The most pathetically inept win thar special teams damn near lost for you!
Someone greased the pig skin.
As a Bears fan I can appreciate Robert Quinn's enthusiasm but can we at least win the game before mocking the belt? At least then it'll be better, rather than doing it in the 1st Q when Rodgers can still easily embarrass us, like he just did earlier.
WOW!!  THAT QB FOR CHICAGO IS AMAZING!!  LIKE TRYING TO CATCH A CHICKEN,  BRAH BE "SCRAMBLING."🐔🐓🐔
As a packers fan I believe this is our best defense since the super bowl run
As a Packers fan, I have to tip my hat to Fields. He's got the heart of a champ. I can see that he'll do anything to win, no matter the score.
Packers Special teams they gonna have an hard week
Packers are a joke, they’ve had the easiest devision in all of football since 2006. And with a HOF quarterback you got 1 Super Bowl lmao. But don’t worry Arron Rogers owns the bears but Brady owns rings.
Y
The "cant advance the ball" rule is STOOPID
Did the packer’s special team even show up? They sucked!!!
If we don't do something about special teams on return and coverage it could end up like the year we muffed the onside kick...2011???
from having an surprisingly great 1st half to shitting the bed bears style
Not a Bears fan but Collinsworth is right, sure looks like they've found their new starter. He really fought right down to the end and for a rookie played strong. Likewise the Bears in general who as others have said their special teams made the Pack's look like a CFL team. Haha While the Lions are awful, the Bears have future potential like that Vikings receiver Jefferson and maybe Cousins. Meanwhile the Pack seem capable of beating almost anyone, the question again like last  year will be can they stop Brady, Fournette and the champs in the playoffs. They can handle the Cards. I'm still dreaming of a Rodgers-Mahommes SB like I was last year. Hopefully if it's Mahommes-Bradt which no1 who's not a Bucs or Pats fan wants anyway, the outcome will be diff from a year ago.
this has to be the game of  the year
At the half I wasn't even concerned one bit that the Packers would lose. Rodgers still owns the Bears.
Jacksonville Jaguars SHOULD'VE KEPT Lewis an Lazard.
let this be a lesson to you. never mock the discount double check
Packers -12 had me sweating the entire game... thought it was a guaranteed L until they dominated the second half. And then that onside recovery happened and my heart sank into my chest... got so lucky bears got no points out of that
The announcers sucked off the bears so hard even while they were losing. Praising bears QB after throwing a pick???? They love to hate on small market teams
CONGRATS DEVANTE MR.99 OVR ADAMS ON 2ND ALL TIME PACKERS TDs! ! ONLY ONE LEFT IS DON HUTSON!!
Justin Fields can ball. Come to Philly we dont care for Rodgers. We want Fields! How did Chicago get so lucky
Ha So glad I don’t waste sundays to football anymore these suffice. Thanks ✌️😉😎 I was was way more productive today because of it. One day the bears won’t be such heart breakers... But one day well also apparently live on Mars. So in due time ✌️🤗
DA DA DUN DADADA DUN TOE PACK TOE! WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MARTY MCFLY AND A BEARS FAN? AT SOME POINT MCFLY STOPS GOING BACK TO 1985 XD. STUFFED DA BEARS LIKE MOZZARELLA IN A PIZZA CRUST!
DA DA DUN DADADA DUN TOE PACK TOE! WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MARTY MCFLY AND A BEARS FAN? AT SOME POINT MCFLY STOPS GOING BACK TO 1985 XD. STUFFED DA BEARS LIKE MOZZARELLA IN A PIZZA CRUST!
Rasul Douglas alone should make Green Bay's GM win GM of the Year
Oh look another win. Bears you should try that…
Fields did do good tho the bears are going to be good next year draft,free agents and mack back I think bears are going to be solid next couple years once fields settles in and they add a few pieces
And how about Mercedes Lewis being there every time you need him this season.
Fields has a bright future gotta clean those mechanics up but he is definitely a franchise qb
Release ogletree
Quinn thought mocking the belt was a myth, he has done it two times in his career already, he thought it was just a fluke and tried it a third time, thinking third times the charm... lol Some people just don't learn.
Nothing beats Mr football than Al Michaels....true voice
That last TD from Davante was absolutely beautiful. The only WR lined up out wide and made the DB look like a high school equipment manager.
Rasul Douglas needs some respect
You should be able to advance on a muffed punt. You should be able to advance on an onside kick. No clue why those rules exist still. It would add some incredible and rare plays over time.
WE STILL OWN YOU🧀🤣🤣
Those 2 that got called back on the bears scoring was pretty bad luck ...what a game though !
How bad do you have to be to have the special teams show up 4 times on the highlight reel 🤦‍♂️
Bruh what the f is up with this packers special team. Replace them
Oh well we came up short again but at least Chicago tried though this was a hell of game and from reading some of comments below yeah y’all right dude was a idiot for mocking Aaron Rodgers smh 🤦🏾‍♂️
Bears got robbed this game
#GoPackGo Thanks for adding to a beautiful Sunday of football. 🌞 🏈 👍 🧀
NEVER….mock The Belt. Gets em every time. 😎
Doesn't matter how bad the special teams were this game... when they mocked the belt after that first sack it was a done deal.
Rodgers is MVP. End of discussion
The bears O line gonna get Fields seriously injured
Both of these quarterbacks are so elite. Rodgers can put the ball on a sewing needle, and fields is as oily as the floors at Burger King. The kid can’t be tackled behind the line.
Bears and bears fans what a bunch of losers 🤣🤣🤣
and number 12 very smart thingking a moment big 🥇 and some guy arrow there beautifull way and You guy very fast kip that it ‘s the way 😃😃😃🙏🙏🙏
I can finally have the courage of my convection that we will make the Super Bowl last year the CB was giving up to many big plays and we got pressure but wasn’t completely stoping the other team. Now with Douglas proving his worth and getting Alexander back bruh I haven’t even heard or seen Kevin king play lol this defense is scary especially knowing Aaron don’t have to worry about the defense giving up 30 in the first half and can play his game
Waaoo beautiful games 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾💪🏾🦾
Special team is still  trash i have a feeling this will cost them in the playoffs.
The officials helped the Package win the game.
Packers got bailed out
I fell asleep after the guy made fun of Rodgers.  Pretty much knew the outcome after that
Ahh yes, Packers special teams. They put the "we suck ass" in special team.
Rodgers going allout on his last season with us. Respect.
Lmfao, still just one super bowl and not gonna win any more
Happy that the packers won, but they were moments I really wanted to cry.
Thanks for NOT SHOWING UP special ED teams… Y’all almost cost us game…  That score is deceiving…  Coming from a Packers fan, we should have lost this game…
Ahhh the 3rd side to football that garners little respect. Until sh*t like this lol
Man I was praying for the packers to lose  think ravens can beat them home the cards lose to the rams tomorrow than the colts us bucs need that first round bye
Bruh ....... that special teams was paid off...... They were wprking against Rodgers..... But the greatness always shines through
The packers special teams really gave up 13 points and almost gave up 24. Somebody has gotta get booted out the door tomorrow
I want to see more roughing the passer penalties on Rodgers.  Give that arrogant jerk some pain.
Rodgers still owns you bears!!!
A holding penalty was a highlight ehh?
Quinn should of known not to mock the GOAT!
As a bears fan I'm impressed with the way they played they need to keep up that energy they have.
Poor bears fans. They really thought they had a chance
Again Nagy can not make adjustments defensively, Rodgers 20 minutes to throw on every play. This is not the coaching staff for this team.
Beats using jakeem grant better than what the dolphins were doing
That was a hell of a game
5:38 I had to look twice, I thought I was watching Devin Hester
Solid team Green Bay has.  Jones and Dillon are phenomenal.
Can someone explain why the bears had 2 touchdowns ruled out? Why couldn't they advance it?
How was that onside kick return not a touchdown for the Bears? The Packers dude touched it, making it a live ball.  Was there a recent rule change?
Special Teams and defense is how we lose playoff games. But “we still own you” !!!
Special teams gonna have a Come To Jesus meeting tomorrow - good hell.
Bears beat the packers mentally an they know it...
Rodgers is unstoppable when he gets his passes off under 3 seconds. Four or more seconds not so good. Sacks and incompletions.
Look what happened.  Two Bears players mocked the belt and the Packers won.  Rodgers is undefeated when opposing players mock the belt.
Shouldn't have mocked the Belt
Why can’t you advance the ball on special teams? Dumb rule
You can't advance it? Dumb.
The Packers were 2 called back touchdowns from losing tonight. Salute to them for getting the win but they really shouldn't feel good about the way their Special teams almost gave away their win tonight. As a Dolphins fan I know the pain of Special teams winning losing a game
Just wait till them cowboys knock these packers out the playoffs 😂😂😂💯
I wanted to see anti vaccine Rodgers lose so bad
Jakkem the dream
Bears could have use more brain they have a good chance to win.
SO  SHWEEEETTT...much  love  Tee with  LIONS  NAMED LEO.[the music  worldwide} oooo weee  GREAT  GAME..!!
That punt return in 3qt was BS Bears scored...SMH
Bad luck bears. They should've won this game
You don’t mock the belt
OMG that route by davante at 13:08 was absolutely sickening, thats so hard to guard lol
Aaron Rogers M.V.P again
OmG!!! I’m a Bears guy, but kept thinking how amazing A.R. Is the first 3 quarters.. keeps his head.. Then Got PUMPED Seeing how Fields NEVER STOPPED FIGHTING!!! So Appreciate what I’ve been seeing out of Justin. And as Always (at least since I grew up anyway) Respect for Aaron Rodgers

More like special ed teams for the Packers tonight, amirite guys? :
Route running by lazard lowkey underrated
These kids don't know cooth just dollar signs and blunts
I'm surprised the Bears still haven't learned not to mock the belt.
Who's the woman with the scraggly hair subbing for Rodgers?
Why have we not had a good special teams since Cobb returned kicks....
Our special teams coach should be fired
Our defense actually played decent but the special teams let up almost half of the bears points we have to work on that
Offense was great in 2-4th Qs, Def was so-so in 1st half and great in 2nd half, Sp Teams was just play retarded the whole night! Matt needs to do something over there!
I’m not a packers fan but watching the special teams here made me cringe and highly annoyed
I've never really thought about the rule that you can't advance the ball on a muffed punt or onside kick. Wow that's pretty bullshit though. Also, that was by far the weakest reason I've ever seen to negate a muffed punt.
Fields looked rlly good. obviously one or two slip ups but looks like he is improving
I’m surprised no one is mentioning that David Montgomery only rushed twice in the second half💀 This bears offense really about to get fields career over in no time
As soon as I saw Quinn mock the belt I knew the bears were in DEEP trouble.
Can we all agree now, stats and eye test that justin fields is trash.. his mechanics are 🗑, his accuracy is god awful, he can run yes he can make time in the pocket but he has no idea what he’s doing nor what zone coverages are.. 3 years at OSU you’d think he figure out cov 2, cov 3, nickle and dime hell zero blitz is basic man.. but he just hurls the ball into traffic or it’s an out route 5 yards and he can’t even throw that without a pick..
Stupid cheese heads
Packs look really almighty this season. Their eager to win the SB is scary. I hope they won't win the NFC final, again.
Maybe if teams never mock the belt, they might have a fighting a chance. The bears never learn
Packers Special Teams is really "special" this season...
After further review da bears still suck and Rodgers still owns you!!!!! Even though the Packers special teams leave something to be desired!!!!! when are da bears going to learn not to mock the belt!!!!
Chicago Bears can KISS MY ASS!! 🐻⬇️
No matter how hard the Bears try, Aaron Rodgers still owns them.
As a packer fan I learned 3 things today  1. Rodgers still owns the bears  2. Special teams is the packers Achilles heal 3. Rodgers has ascended into the meme dimension
The Bears are impressive losers.
Bears are so bad... Thanks to the Packers special teams for all the gifts that allowed us to make it interesting.  Any other special teams in the league and this is a massive blowout... Again
You thought Quinn would have learnt from his mistake in the last time both teams met that you shouldn't mock the belt in front of Rodgers
Rodgers still owns the Bears
Good game
This rivalry sucks, the bears are such a soft and weak organization. The packers are so far ahead of the bears it’s just depressing.
I feel bad for Fields
I'll admit that Rodgers owns the bears, but that doesn't take away from the fact that Chicago went into Lambeau Field and Played up to the same level as Green Bay, they just couldn't stretch it out to win it. I've been contemplating what team to root for and follow for a while now and I've decided on the bears. As weird as it seems to be a bears fan willingly, there's only up and by the looks of this team, up is all they can go towards
This man Rogers on the special teams had dropped like 5 punts this season
The NFL really needs to get rid of this "can't advance" on a muffed punt recovery or onside kick recovery. That rule is incredibly stupid.
It only took the Bears 70 years to find Sid Luckmans shoe filler. McMahon - Buddy Ryan = Rex Grossman
As a Ravens fan. I’m terrified for next week lol
Next year will be better no Roger's and filds will have experience
How do kickoffs work then I know in madden if the kicking team recovers it they can advance it unless that only can happen in madden
That toss to grant was a pass touchdown for fields looool . Fields suckkssssss so bad
Is this team ever going to get healthy?  Every game they lose starters and the guys that have been out aren’t close to coming back.  If they get healthy, look out
Sure is weird that the NFL didn't show the end of that play where Adams got called for offensive pass interference. Didn't even let it go long enough to show there was a flag. I wonder why they didn't want to show it. So weird.
!!!I DON'T WANT TO WORK....!!!!
Good to see Damien Williams playing. He should’ve been the SB MVP when he was on the Chiefs. San Diego boi!
I don’t think I’ve ever seen so many special teams plays make the highlight reel….. sheesh
Bears played really well, better then I expected. I credit the defensive coordinators and special teams staff for the halftime adjustments and the player for the bears that went out of bounds for ensuring that the Packers won lol
God sake..fire the special team coordinator!! 🤷🙏
Only one name comes up when I hear of special teams and the Pack. Bostick
The Packers better pay Rogers and Adams the money they want. It would be stupid if Rogers or adams leave because of green bay Gm making stupid decisions.
Wow, as a Lions fan this was very entertaining to watch. A real division rivalry here. Good game and exciting
Rigged
Tonight GP special team so special(?) 😆
The bears under aaron rodgers ownership is not doing so well... maybe he should consider selling the team?
Great game
Imagine mocking the belt when your franchise is 5-22 against Rodgers 🤡
What have you done, Robert? You have jinxed us
As long as the Packers can get by Baltimore and Cleveland, it should be a wrap for the NFC championship game.
Bears manage to show some fight in the first half.
Чикаго хорошо играли!
Rogers has to be perhaps the best passing quarterback to have played the game. Its nuts how talented of a passer he is.
Great Game, go pack go!!
‘I still own you’ Rasul Douglas to my heart.
Even tho it sucked losing Jamal Williams., AJ has decide to show up and show out that he is a force that need to be watched
11:49 damn he cost the L smh
Rodgers MVP. GB special teams were a disgrace.
That GB defence was complete trash in the secondary
Douglas though what a pick up
All these people talking about mocking the belt as if that really made a difference. The Bears are not a good football team and they’re poorly coached. They put together 2 good quarters, a football game is 4 quarters…that’s been their problem, all year. 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
NO APOLOGIES!!! BEARS!!! DOWNNNN!!! BEARS!!!DOWNNNNNNN!!! CHEESEHEAD4LIFE!!! GOOD WEEK IN SCONNIE LAND!!!
I say this as a browns fan, that running out of bounds call to call back the fumbled punt TD was one of the weakest calls this year.
The Bears gave a great fight. I'm a life long Packers fan and the Bears really tried their best to beat us today. If only they would have the same tenacity playing against us as they do with other teams they would most probably be in the playoff discussion.
Even with the loss , the Bears have to be happy with their performance that game. Good job.  GO PACK GO !
Tainted. 🤌🏼
Special teams ugh 😣
0:47 ... That's when he took it personally.
Rodgers accuracy is insane.
When you mock the belt, you pay with your blood and soul  What would happen if someone do it during the championship
Strawberry Fields throws a 5 yard pass, dude runs 40+ yards to score.  Rodgers THROWS a 40+ yard pass Adams runs 5 yards to score!  BOW DOWN SHITCAGO bears!
Special teams were the wrong kind of special today. Tighten it up Packers!
The refs hate Da Chi . 🐻 ⬇️
how many BS flags does it take for the slackers to win a game ...... oooooooh 3 or 4 lol ... bunch of cheaters
This game was wild? But why didn’t that onside kick TD not count?
We used up the rest of our TDs for the season on this game and still came up short  pain
So Is Aaron Rodgers now the GM of the Bears on top of being the owner?
Good game kid! You played the best!
Special Teams needs to tighten up for next week, overall it was a good game. Go Pack Go
As a Vikings fan it's ok bears fans we will whoop the heck out of the packers when comes week 16:)
8:15 the guy holding the chains must have PTSD from getting ran into or something, dropped it mad early
As a Bear’s fan, Aaron Rodgers really does own us.
best quarterback in the game
You can't advance the ball if you're the kicking team of an onside kick? Even if the other team touches it?? Who the hell made up that rule and why???
"OH WOW SHEAN DESAI IS SUCH A GREAT DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR! HES REALLY CARRYING THE TEAM RN!" NO GREAT D COORDINATOR LETS ANOTHER TEAM DROP 40 ON EM. IDC HOW BAD THE OFFENSE IS
Jlçois
Why the packers special team trying to loose .. this is really fishy
Even Matt LeFleur was crying at the effort by his special teams
As a Packers fan- my respect to DaBears. Great game. A real nail biter. We're just a little more luckier.
Kip lacky lacky and lacky 🙏🙏🙏👍👍👍
They mocked the belt. They died. End of story.
GO PACK GO 💚 💛 🏈💚💛💚💛
As a Vikings fan come on bears i wanted you to win SKOL
I seen the belt get mocked. I went to bed.
Can't wait to see how Skip is gonna try to blame those 30 pts on Rodgers. 🙄
Bears fought hard. Had a 10 point lead a few times in the game. Justin needs to be built around dude can be special.
Rodgers still own the bears
I love Wisconsin sports
Keep mocking the belt at your own risk
Another bad call
Idc bears will never beat us ever in devante Adams is top 5 best receiver inna league!!!! Pacnation!!!!!
The belt. That is it. Do not disrespeck the belt.
Quinn 🤣🤣🤣🖕
Special teams got a lot of cleaning up to do. Disgusting
Rodgers is staying in Greenbay. He has no legacy other than beating the lowly Bears. Big deal
Once the Bears mocked the belt the game was officially over for the Bears👀🤣🤣
What a crazy second quarter. 45 Pts combined inside of the 11:00 minute mark, dam! AR is just tough to beat.
Why would you punt the ball down by 10 points on 4th and inches in the 4th quarter against The Packers and Aaron Rodgers?! That was a very dumb call! Matt Nagy should be fired immediately after this game and not be allowed to coach again, ever!
I ‘m very Happy 😃 for You 🏅
What’s the belt? I’m kinda of new to football
Packs as usual get the calls from the refs to keep them in the game
The Packers did nothing last year . Maybe this game will get the coach to bring in a special team coordinator.  You can't get through the playoffs with a special team that can not score but gives up touchdowns and turnovers. I lost count on how many points the Bears scored on the special teams. Matt LeFleur  putting "special" in the Packers special team. 40 and 44 yard kickoff returns. 97 yard return for a TD. Fumbled a punt. Fumbled an onside kick. You don't beat the Cards or the Bucs with those mistakes.
The bears majority owner Aaron Rodgers has made the team forfeit this game cause of bilal nichols gimmick infringing his belt celebration
How can you come off a bye week and look so bad in special teams??? When was the last time we had some good special teams??
Somebody need to sign me for greenbay I’ll run the ball all day long
Quinn: *mocks belt  Rodgers: You're already dead.
Our Special teams has been so atrocious this entire season. From Crosby missing tap ins to this junk we saw today. Otherwise it's good to see A. Rod increasing his ownership stake in the Bears
The bears thought they were gonna beat rodgers 😂😂
Packers got a huge Homer call on that special teams play with the Bears player going out of bounds. Should have been Bears ball at the Packers 20 yard line!
Rodgers and Adams doing what they do best, beating the Bears
All you guy good jop, very beautiful all hand 🙏🙏🙏👍👍👍
Robert Quinn is living proof that you should never make fun of the discount double check, especially if you sack A Rod
What a game!!! 👍👍👍👍👍
🖕🏾the Packers! Like this if you agree!
Fields sucks
I’m not a packers fan, but if I was I’d want opponents to mock the belt every time. Always seems to work out well for old man Rodgers 👍
Matt Nagy in the first half: "I'm having so much fun!"   Aaron Rodgers: "I'm gonna end this man's career."   Matt Nagy in the Second half: "Aight imma head out."
Bears HC and GM will lose their job after this season.
The competition for the best record in the NFL has been great
Man this game was so crazy. Rasul Douglas was amazing this season it really shows you just cause someone is on the practice squad doesn't mean they're bad they just might not get the opportunities to shine. Like he had the game winning int against Arizona, the man is skilled fr.
This game was so good in such a weird an unexplainable way
Give Lefleur Coach of the year already. Don't cheat him for the 3rd year in a row. Idc. Belichick has 30yrs of experience. Lefleur doesn't even have 3.
Aaron Rodgers will always own the Bears
Somebody better inform the McCaskey family that they don't own the Chicago Bears that Aaron Rodgers does.
This game was A-OK. Aaron is good
“And IiiiiiiiiiiIiiiiii…will always ownn youuuuuuUuuuuuu!”
Refs robbed the bears out of 2 touchdowns smhw
if the bears played every game like they played the first half of this game, they'd be one of the top teams in the league
Still up by 2 games (NFL history wins) but since 1992 Packers been giving it to us 🤬🤬🤬 Brett Favre & Aaron Rodgers changed everything in this rivalry.  Hopefully from next we can start beating this mtfks again.   Btw I have to hear once again my son BS because of his fking cheeseheads 🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤬🤣
Aaron Rodgers was gassed out by halftime that he had to sub-in his stunt double from the stands to get a break
You can make a serious case now that mocking the bell is almost a curse
0:43 Aaron Rodgers (Michael Jordan voice) I Took That Personally
Never mock the belt. We do need help on special teams tho, other than that we played great. Go Pack GO!! 🧀💚
It's a shame that Rodgers is an idiot off the field
Bear fans were screaming crazy this night is going to be their night in the first half... after that not too much
Packers were lucky to pull this off. Not often does a team win when their special teams played terribly.
Aaron rodgers went bear hunting again 🏹🐻 how many bear tags does he have? 1,000 🤣🤣🤣
Where did all these short Bears speedsters come from. They looked electric
Rodgers was majestic tonight. I think Justin Fields is a keeper
I feel for the poor bastards lined up against Adams. Haha his launch off the line is so damn tricky you don’t know where the hell he’s going.
Packers special team definitely running extra laps in practice
With special team played like this, the Packers still managed to win it by 15 points, it is just amazing.
Bears DBs need to learn how to tackle. Unbelievable
Rodgers is superb
All I want for Christmas is Nagy getting fired.
Have you ever ate a whopper?
I thought Devin Hester came out of retirement 😂
Idk about special team rules anymore lol
Back 2 3rd place in the NFC Schmuccaneers.  SN: Please don't let that horrendous Special Team performance resurface in the playoffs.
Minimum wage Douglus is doing quite well.
IDK which throw was more impressive. Rodgers TD throw to Adams at 6:40 or Adams no look pass to the camera man at 6:47
Nothing is more demoralizing than a running game that moves the chains and can't be stopped. Way to go pack !!!!
rodgers is “immunized” to losing recently lol
"But da referees!!!!" - Bears fans
Still owns em😥
DO NOT MOCK THE BELL
Smoking on 🐻 tonight
When they sacked Rodgers and they did the belt thing he does I knew it was over for them.
When are defensive players going to learn not to mock the belt?
06:46 LOL
Green Bay’s special teams coordinator: you guys let’s make it interesting after you get the kicks away just let them score and run back Arod should still somehow win us the game lul
He still owns em🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
Went to take a nap and slept through the entire damn game… go pack go though
0:41 DONT MOCK THE BELT! It was over as soon as Robert Quinn mocked him in his face everyone knew it. 6:40 This is the funniest crap I’ve seen all game that dude gets destroyed by his own teammate. Crawford I think 15:18 just salt on the wound. It was done fourth down and you intercept it.  GO PACK GO
There were two things for me: 1. The Google search cardboard post by the Packer's fan with a picture and name of Aaron Rogers as "Owner of the Bears".😂 2. That strikingly resembling fan to Aaron Rogers.😲
Defense only allowed 14 points. Top 10 defense 100%. Special teams??? Bottom 30 for sure
I am so glad that the Packers were able to avenge Wisconsin for what Justin Fields did to them in 2019.
Special teams won the game for the bears, bustin fields handed it right back to them. Good thing he didn’t try to pass it to them
packers defense is insane!!!!!!!
Evidently the Bears wanted a second opinion...and it's in.  Rodgers owns them all.
The bears secondary is garbage
Never mock the belt!!! Especially twice. Just a smooth 45 points after that to remind everyone who the baaaaaaaaaad man is!!
Robert Quinn hasn’t learned his lesson, has he?
It's like watching Cutler 😭
Robert Quinn will never learn…
Such a good fking game. Had me on my feet most of the time. There was a moment I thought the packs were gonna lose in that first half but my worries was soon put to rest. Great plays all around. Bears running is good their specials carried hard in that first half. But a int and a fumble will hurt you. Some dumb calls were made I will admit I think more on packs. The biggest issue for the bears was the injuries
Even though the Packers won, their special teams did not. They allow the Bears to stay in the game until the 4th quarter. And let’s not forget the refball too!
Good Game Green Bay, Hopefully with Better Coaching My BEARS will Get Better Next Season 💔🏈🐻⬇🙏🏽
Fields shows he as good as lamar.... running is all he can do
why cant we have the madden angle to see routes and coverages
Fields is Trubisky. Trubisky is Fields. Fire Ryan Pace for trading away more draft picks than he's selected!
on that 97 yard run where what's his name held the ball with 2 fingers, I was hoping he'd drop it but no such luck.  Why wasn't that a touchdown at the end for the Bears? It's a fumble on an onside kick. I always thought that that could be advanced. I hate Mickey Mouse rules that mimic the Infield Fly Rule.
aaron rodgers just showed how much of a game changer he really is
As a Bears fan, aged 55-- seems like nothing has changed for Prime Time Bears games.. The third quarter brought me straight back to the Eric Hipple game
Don’t mock the belt
Bears player: Mocks the belt   Packer fans: it’s the 1st quarter and we already won
Go pack go 10-3
Really interesting game that the packers probably would’ve won either way, but the bears got *robbed* of *TWO* special teams touchdowns. One would’ve been a TD but instead became a scoring drive for the packers. The other just became an INT after eating up clock, sealing the game. It’s just ridiculous. Bears vs refs on prime time, and this isn’t even the first time it happened this year.
E
Aaron was so mystical tonight that he even watched the game from the stands while whooping the bears ass 😂😂😂😂.
Is it me or is it that every time Quinn mocks Rodgers with the belt, Rodgers seems to beat tf out of the Bears? Dont fire Nagy, fire Quinn
Aaron let the bears have a head start just so he could show you how fast he could come back.
Mock the belt but still got owned
Jim Harbaugh
When will Robert Quinn ever learn to not mock the belt. Chicago u might wanna think about not only firing Naggy but cut Quinn too if u wanna beat us 😂😂😂
I know people like to make fun of LaFleur for losing back to back NFC Championships but to be 36-9 is impressive. There's plenty of teams that would do anything to have this record in the span of 3 years.
Everyone on the bears has 99 speed
“Robert Quinn mocks belt” Aaron Rodgers - “so you choose death”
don’t mock that belt cmon has no one learned.
*My whole effin life I've owned you! I own you! I still own you! I still own you!*
Refs: Rob bears of multiple points during a prime time game  Refs: It’s even funnier the second time!
Packer's special team is really "Special".   I dont know how much worse they can get...but GoPackGo
He really do own the bears
Aaron Rodgers domesticating bears out here
Thought the packers were going to lose until I remembered its just the bears
Remember that one time Matt Nagy made a second half adjustment? Me either.
Bears are cursed. They've never had elite QB and never will.
Special teams and tacking were terrible by Green Bay. Still a W though.
Fields had flashes but he always made some TERRIBLE decisions. Hope he pans out in the league tho.. 💯
Rodgers just isn't good enough to win a super bowl without a defense like he had in 2010, but he will always own the Bears for the time he was on the field.
Don’t let Aaron Rodgers owning the Bears distract you from the fact that this was bar none the single worst special teams performance I’ve ever seen
You bring out a certain badass in Aaron Rodgers when you mock him
Go pack go 🧀🧀
Aaron Rodgers had a nice performance for the Green Bay offense and the Packers defense slowed down the Bears just enough for the win.
People usually blame Nagy for the Bears lack of success, but do not look at their long lack of success under the ownership of Aaron Rodgers.
Aaron Rodgers owns the Bears. Always has, always will. When he retires his next career will be as the actual owner of the franchise!
Guys Chris Collinsworth REALLY likes the Packers.   If you couldn’t tell.
NEVER MOCK THE BELT 🧀
Devante Adams is the best WR in football. The way he runs routes is a work of art. He is so effortless
Packers Special Teams hanging with Snoop B4 the game is not kool..After Please
"BELT" -Travis Scott, Aaron Rodgers
WE STILL OWN YOU!!!
WE STILL OWN YOU!
Aaron to the Bears: I own you! Matt Nagy: No you don't! I do! Look what I have done to them the last couple of years compared to what you've done your whole career! Amateur!
Justin is actually in the worst rookie QB situation.....he just doesn't make it look that way when you consider Dalton struggled to put up more than 10 against the Lions. He put up damn near 30 vs DET Best rookie QB imo                                    -CARDS fan.
I did not like the reffing it felt real biased, the out of bounds punt call was honestly not called for and even the onside kick is just a dumb rule
L bears
As a packers fan….keep Nagy, he’s been amazing 👍🏽😃he deserves an extension
Wait!  Y'all didn't think Da Bears would win, did you? lol
As a packer fan even though we won i didn’t have my doubts but I wanna whine like the bears fans and I wanna know on that muffed punt play why it wasn’t blown dead for a delay of game? Game just got over like 20 mins ago and I sick of the crying from the bears already.
The bears: excitedly mocking the belt  The bears 2nd half: 😭😭
Robert Quinn: *mocks belt* Aaron Rodgers: *proceeds to throw 4 touchdowns*
Mocked the belt eh... Oh well
This stopped being a rivalry after the 2010 NFC Championship game
That Rodgers play action fake at 3:28 was a thing of beauty!
As soon as the Belt got mocked…..Everyone knew it was over.
Special teams almost cost us the game but you never mock the belt
Like a wise man  said "I still own u''
NEVER MOCK the Championship belt!!! When is players gonna learn 😭
At this point as a Bears fan, I really don’t care about these next 4 games of the season, I just want to be ready for them to make some wholesale changes to the front office and in the coaching, because things are not looking up right now
Lol I guess Aaron Rodgers still owns the bears
Bears fans better hope that Jordan Love becomes a bust
I was ridiculed for picking Devante Adams with my #1 selection. Sitting on top in my fantasy league and he balls out consistently for me who’s laughing now? Haha
Daddy Rodgers still owns the bears lmao
I Had Aaron Rodgers On My Fantasy And Guess Who I Was Vs’ing Against?? D Adams And Aaron Jones Plus Packers Defense🤦🏾🤦🏾🤦🏾 At Least I Made Tha Fantasy Playoffs Tho🤷🏾😭😭
Lets be honest here. The Bears lost this game in the first quarter the moment that one idiot decided to mock the belt.
As a packers fan, our special teams did everything they could to loose us this game
Goat Rodgers
Rodgers to the Bears: I own you! Own you!  Brady to the Bills: First time?
They Never Learn 0:41
It’s official. Aaron Rodgers owns the Bears and he always will.
The packers are so good I’m such a happy camper being a packers fan I can’t express my joy
I don't know why you can't advance the ball in those Onside Kick circumstances. I feel like that rule could easily be changed down the line.
Aaron legend Rodgers
NEVER MOCK THE BELT!!! 😤
Rodgers is a beast
4-TIME SUPER BOWL CHAMPION GREEN BAY PACKERS BEATS MY HOMETOWN CHICAGO BEARS
Rodgers still the bears owner
We still own you !!
Packers: FC Barcelona!  Bears: Southampton!
Num 2
the packers vs bears is the nfc conference's equivalent to the patriots vs jets! it's a one sided affair, it's not even consider a rivalry anymore, humiliation, destruction, laughable and the game is too easy! in fact, the bears are pretty much the new york jets of the nfc! haha
