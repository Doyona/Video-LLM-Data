Watching this in 2025. Unreal to see how the channel has grown.🎉
This is one of the series I missed. I Guess Ill Be Watching All The Videos In October 2025. Thanks Matt 🙏🏻
crazy how frustrating this is!? where in the world did you mention the price you ve got it for???
How does these super Cars ended being money pits ! Huh
damn the green would get me sick after 1 day working on it xD
Hi Mat. Im from the future and am telling you to replace to GFA in this car
Nobody else would touch a Car like this with all the work it needs but thats what makes it interesting l guess, glad it's you not me. BaZ
I agree Matt,
Hello please change your traducteur français
Bulschit dis
Geil, mit schaltgetriebe! Das ist schon ein Grund warum man ihn kaufen sollte! 👌🏻
Ich schreibe mal irgendwas Hauptsache es hilft dir....👍🤷
Moi aussi j’aimerais appuyer sur la gâchette devant des super-cars sauf que chez moi la poudre est mouillé 😂🎉🎉
Encore un qui demande de l'aide financière pour rénover une voiture !!! Il y en a tellement qui font une cagnotte
Lamborghini n'es pas allemand mes Italiens
Ça doit pas être une vrai
Hola, Mat, te sigo con tus vídeos y me gustan mucho, se que es un problema de que todos no están traducidos al español,  yo no sé idiomas, pero bueno seguiré así  Gracias
If you say “No one couldn’t fix” it that is entirely right😂😂.   We we would’ve fixed that car no problems 😅. Even the owner wouldn’t know or noticed  It’s as a matter of money and time people didn’t wanna invest to….
Quien en 2024 🎉❤
almost 2 years to the day, amazing youtuber, best on the platform
What a risk
that car is the same age as me... wtf?
😮
😂😂😂 morsel Lago bro stop saying it like that you guys look ridiculous is pronouncing it im English is pronounced in spanish
That ow ow ow ow ow, owk... Lamboghini mercy transition was lit💯😎😅😅😅😅
1 year later and he’s at 3m subs
This channel makes me so happy
i just saw a GumBall3000 badge on the car
Is it just me that wants to know how much he bought it for and how much it cost to put it back together, enjoy the video but frustrating such a small detail was left out.
K swap it
Hermoso auto, pero que color de mierda...
Yo
Ciao grande!, I was watching this video of the Murcielago, and because i'm italian n i onestly don't understand every single word with english yet, especially with some one talkings with British accecent, i was doing It with english subtitle, the One automatically generated by YouTube , and I'd must tell you that when you say "Murcielago" the tool wrote down in the subtitle "Mercy Locker" ...!!!... 🤣🤣🤣  That's the case!..  Any way, man, i really enjoy your videos, i think your job Is great, and you and your crew are so Amazing and very funny people. Thanks a lot, for the example you show, about your "Hard work beat talent"... That's great! Thanks again, Keep going likes that!  LoLove from Italy   Nandi
Awesome video! I’ll be watching them all!
Why do Lamborghinis always have to be in obnoxious colors they're already a beautiful car simple black but they're always like yellow and bright orange and I'm sorry to say lime green the car is already a looker everyone is going to turn their head you don't have to make it some bright obnoxious color to get people's head to turn everyone knows you spent $200,000 on the car
Only recently found your channel and I'm so glad I did, once again the content is brilliant all wrapped  up with such a diverse music background, I can't wait to watch and listen to the next, Well done Mat....
I bet the guy that rebuilt the engine was the same guy that jumped it wrong🤦‍♂️
Gumball 3000 sticker, -10000£ off the market price right there
Mat you are a good guy I love watching your videos bro your a legend ❤🎉🫂
0:51 배기음
still wont tell everyone the price for it
the steering wheel on those are shocking
500k of us! Few more now :)
You are a LEGEND!!!
Crazy build again etc - so impressive. Nothing content related, but it does show you what junk this car really is beneath
Will you respray it?
love your channel. i am from pakistan and watch all your videos. i only imagine all of the cars here in our country.
I am happy for this guy, his dreams are coming true
It must ne rough living in the uk with speed cameras everywhere u cant even drive fast.over in the us where i am there not any speed cameras. It would suck having to go slow all the time with a nice car
On a binge..  Love your work. I always reckon, if you follow a hobby, an interest and some YouTuber has been there before you and taken the time to share the experience, the knowledge, least I can do is like, (yep subbed) and tap a comment, even if it is only, Well done!  You beaut!  Sure it helps them and nothing more than I would like if it were me.  Mat is a beauty!  Oh, and his team..  I'm bingeing these, down under with a hankering for Italin cars. to be honest, apart from Antartica, I could not think of a worse continent to follow my dreams.  Fun trying!
Man.. love it your contents style! I'm new to your channel 😉😀.
Congratulations 🎉👏 Weldone!!
Wow 😳 you got your dream car
WE should thank Donut and James for getting me here! I even left halfway through how luxury cars rip you off to check it out... that being said, I'll definitely be back after I finish my donut crews video!
Love this channel brother
Bro i admire you so much,keep up the good work🤝🙏🏻
This dude is always so positive. It’s great to see
Love this channel! Mat’s the BEST!!
What’s up bro no content? Murxcielago at the gum ball rally thanks to shmeee and we haven’t seen it running
Why are you not telling us how much you paid for the damn car?
Looking for comments from Tavarish....
Respect the grind ❤
what was the asking price though?
Everyman racing sounds like a proper cowboy outfit
10:09 LMAO , its  still funny Matt
I hope you connect with Tavarish
Ga tau kenapa ya, koq rasanya nyenengin bisa perbaikin barang rusak.. apalagi mobil impian gini.. nice spirit bro, lanjutkan!🔥 salam dari Labuan Bajo
why many of your videos are incomplete?
from carvertical it looks like it has <80k on it. and tensioner is worn? Well... Italian technology. My Toyota 4runner has 350k on it and engine is like new...
Hey arm's add part no of the video to thumbnail to or title
I wish to follow this episode from first but seem to be lost... All i am seeing is part12
I am just surprised by how they could fit such a big engine in a tiny car like that, i thought they would be way smaller
hey mat armstrong can you tell me the date of when the model of your lambo was made my uncle is looking for one and can i start the lambo too pls
lets be honest its already a classic
the right hand drive just ruins a car
What kind of mechanics do they hire at Every Man racing 😂😂😂😂
what was the price
Does he still have the 1000 hp Gallardo?
Watching these a little late but loving your content, all i can see is that racing company should stay well away from these cars, absolutely abusing them and dont know what they're doing
Put a haltec cluster in
To many adverts
Started watching the m5 rebuild. Now I'm going binge watch every video. This is great content 👌
Find a Ferrari 318 like gas monkey has… shut him down!!!! Richard Rawlings needs to mind his own bobber… Fish on
Did anyone play midnight club 3? There was a green Lamborghini just like this in the game it was my favorite care as a kid
I was the 90K like of this video and this is my dream car too! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
that is a parts car 60k max
Nothing happens for a reason, but otherwise it's a pretty good video
How much did that Cost? How much did you gave the seller?
So how much did he pay?!?! LoL
This is like donut money pit but expensive and British and it very much satisfies me
Saw a video with you doing an M4 and thought....nah !...I hate you now..cos I am totally hooked !
Ford fiesta air vents 😂
Sounds like everyman racing has some pretty shotty mechanics...
I can remember the dailogue "seriously what is this place".....IT'S HEAVEN!!!!
Make it a svj
Why am I so excited to see this??
0:14 for a second I thought he put the trailer ball on the lambo 🤦‍♂️
Great content 💪 where can i find the music thats start around the minute 3:41? Thank you
Can we have more videos on this please
Wow young man you have some balls, so just go for it, but just get as much info as you can and do as much as you can without spend, spend and spending money. Good luck, I will be watching with enthusiasm.
Hope you get the money back by selling it in parts, if you do that.
As he said... "I believe Everything happens for a Reason 🤌🤌
drrrrrrr, just found your channel a couples of weeks ago and i am glued to it. you build my confidence every time i watch your videos big ups and thank you🤗 all the way in south africa.
I bet you I could fix it
excellent
Hi Mat Happy New Year to you I trying to see the complete rebuilt of the BMW m5.
Awesome video thanks
Can't believe how you keep smiling, once you see the price of parts, etc Best of luck I look forward to seeing how you get on in the new year 👍
Not to say the lambo ain’t sex on wheels but who’s is that Clio sport @5mins40 she’s puuuurty  🤤🤤
Great video !!
Ugh, please get a camera gimble.
I'm onboard after I saw the M5 Competition. There I heard the initial price of the car. Is it secret for this car? I think it's interesting to share that kind of information.
Well done 👍👍👍
Brave man restoring a track experience day special. Great Vid!
3 million views 😮 go on Matt.
Hmm missing an Instrument Cluster except in your Intro you show it with the other parts on a shelf @6:49 mark; sure it's not in the car but it ain't missing ???🤷‍♂🤷‍♂
I didn't realize there were a bunch of chains in an engine like that. Weird.
What a guy! Class. Respect to you Mat and Hannah!
The only hope is in Jesus Christ today is the day of salvation  John 3:16-21   16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.  20 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.  21 But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.  Mark 1.15   15 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.  2 Peter 3:9  The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.  Hebrews 11:6  6 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.
Maaan i love your tats bro really cool tattoos
Still waiting for a miracle
Wow cool, you’ll use your followers to pay for this Lambo to drive it yourself? Great, at least you’re honest with your capitalistic approach.
To ask for money for your own car from subscribers is just wack.
Resistors don't just "burn up" for no reason.  Something very bad happened to that instrument cluster, like reversed battery.   Start using your teabags twice.
Just swap the engine with a ford fiesta
3 million views wow 🤯
Ok but could you just not call Mur see el Lago?
need acts on video,not just talking 🍻
First time here for me. This looks like an awesome opportunity! What a great project. Good luck to you.
Oh boy, I'm feeling with you all the emotions. Wonderful vid, wishing you a happy build
Why is your dad doing all the work? Who's channel is this??
cant even say how much he paid for it lol
Maybe should have bought the yellow one? By the time you have fixed the green one you will probably be in deeper then the yellow one
holy shit m8.... from 500k too 763k in a month?!?!?!?!     one question tho......     WILL IT FIT IN ME HONDA M8?!?!
there should be 1 or 2 bolts int he engine bay (one usually on the engine itself  is NEG unless 60 +yeahs old...ish lol)    good vid man .  Much love on you hard work man you have alot of work ahread... the cluster has a blown mosfet?
No matter how expensive a car, build with the same garbage parts as your average volkswagon.
Hi Matt, I don't usually comment onlie but I just had to say that your content is so much fun to watch and it is a pleasure seeing a decent good human creating such great content. Well done!
I've always wanted a 308 GTB but I won't.  I am well aware of the problems.  If it was me with the Lamborghini  it would be Chev 350 and auto. Looks the same but more reliable. ( I know someone that had one and it got f#$ed at the dealer or should say by police when seized when mechanic was test driving)
How much did you buy it for?
It isn't that nobody couldn't fix it Adam!!! It that no sensible and good mechanic would take on a job like that without permission and funds to tear it down and start over.  If you do happen to find that 1 mechanic who would do it, your better off using you Cash as toilet paper.
2 N walnut St Fairland Ok
Bye a used TOYOTA the next time if you want to own a real car. Or get a new BMW and wait two years. It will start giving you serious problems and you will get some fun fixing it, if you are into spending a huge amount of money repairing trash. Lambos and Ferrari are expensive sissy trash. The entire world knows that and actually laugh of people who buy them! 🤣😆🤣😆
I would throw a electric motor in it
Ls swap it
I love the lime green and black trim such a good look
More risky. Or riskier. Not more riskier.
Hope the "mechanic" who shorted that Merci got fired straight away, I saw those terminals, you'd either have to be color blind or stupid to get those backwards.
I wonder how many people saw the gumball 3000 sticker and actually know what it is
you could hand make them parts but ......a good deal isn't always good. Kill switch? Interesting.
Fair Play Mat don't change man 👋👋👋👋
I don't care if it's a legend, to mount the battery behind the rear wheel and totally inaccessable, it a travesty of design.
You won't get a v12 but there is currently an audi s6 avant 5.2 v10 auto with paddle shift on auto trader for less than 4k. Is it possible to do an easyish swap of the complete engine and gearbox?
I keep getting drawn in to b.s. yt videos ... the title screams b.s. I've been a mechanic 30+ yrs and one thing that's certain as death and taxes ... nothing is beyond fixing. If you ignore the axe that twice slain me paradox. If you know you know if not ... I broke the handle off my axe when I slayed a nazi I replaced the handle just in time for said nazi return to life to seek vengeance when I slayed the zombie that once was a nazi I split the head of both the zombie and the axe. I replaced the head and hung it above my fireplace. I stood before my fireplace  admire my axe  When the zombie who was a nazi returned as a ghost and said " that's the axe that twice slain me". Yet my only question was, is it?
i will fix it
Take the instrumental binnacle to someone who works on circuit boards like an guitar amp builder.  I've used those guys to chase down lots of circuit board issues.  Had them fix my Aston's shorted out rear lights.
the first 7 minutes = "BUT I'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT THAT LATER ON" "BUT I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT ON ANOTHER VIDEO" "BUT THAT WILL BE ON ANOTHER CHANNEL" jesus H christ. nevertheless, good shit.
never cheap out when it comes to something that pricy
These are kinda like a one of a kind painting by a great artist it’s not just a car it’s the beauty of the car
< < < I BOUGHT A LAMBORGHINI WITH PEOPLE STILL IN IT > > >
Yes, we know what kind of car it is you don’t have to say the name every single time
Your channel is a bit of fun but come on mat …..there must be more money braking it then flafing around repairing it.
PUT IN A  SMALL  MOTOR
So if help with the rebuild can i drive it when it's done 😆?
you buy a abandonned car ???? there is a problem in the title ....
The resistors should be fairly easy to replace.
As soon as I saw those Audi Logos on the relays I would've 🏃🏽‍♂️💨💨💨
Despite the issues you are living the dream !
Cost of living does not affect petrol heads
New subscriber to the channel, can't wait to watch this build. And you seem like a pretty cool bloke @Mat😁
Hi i am a electronics engineer, ermmm resistors dont just burn out, they normally burn out if other things are blown or burnt out also check the electrolytic capacitors they hate reverse biasing! Was wondering what area are you in?
Transplant a hellcat in there bruv. No one will have a chance to laugh when they're staring at your taillights.
It really hurts every time he says murcielago with english pronunciation. This car does not deserve such a treatment...😜
First time I’ve watched your video. Lovely content - but I have to say, hearing the words “but I’ll explain later” so many times is annoying. It’s like bating your own video. We’re already watching it, we wanna know things right now, not wait for later.
This is a fun video to watch, because we all want to find some cheap Lambo and fix it up.  But it takes a ton of cash and going into the unknown.   Mat fun video and love your excitement of getting that Lambo.
You got your hands full with this project my friend. Best of luck.
I have a crx that's running like a truck 👀👀👀🔥🔥🔥
What did he pay for it...??
With all money in the world I'll never get one my friend
Man great content and job, but that color is 🤮🤮🤮
hey Matt, what is the wrap you have on your RR? thanks!
Great project and great video. From all the troubles showed, the biggest one is how to pronunce Murciélago right for an english speaker 🤣🤣
If I had a dollar for every Lamborghini I’d abandoned, I wish I had a dollar.
only watched till the part where the car is loaded, are you sure you didnt get that car for free because noone on their right mind would strap a car like that, least of all a supercar.
if it was abandoned then you could have just claimed it, not buy it, if you had to buy it then it is not abandoned
So many Gallardos! Want them all :D
Could have done without the overly LOUD music that's as loud as the narration ..... Try making your next video with lower volume music or even no music as it detracts from the narration 👎👎👎
LS it lol
I would fit in an ordinary straight 6, stock engine. Trading 150 kph for many engine problems. Lol,  I'm pragmatic.
Just buy the shell and convert it to electric... You know, don't have to install the display to power it... sorry broke. I'm not giving you a cent for a Lamborghini that I don't own...
They took the good cluster of the green one and tried to repair the yellow one, and then they stuck you with the defective cluster, duh.
The trick is to buy a new Lamborghini and use it for parts. Then sell whatever parts you don’t need. Parting it out makes more money in the end.
Hundred of thousands of pounds?lol
Where can I buy one of those your awesome
Liberal bot lmao
No one cares
Holy ears !
Proper rough but can't wait till it's sorted 👌
Does it have to have a Lambo engine in there? What about a merc or bmw v8, just as good
The way he pronounce murciélago its hilarius. Quality content
Ok I’ve changed my mind too many missing parts and I can’t put a jigsaw puzzle together. I can’t sharpen a pencil without chewing the lead
I would put a four cylinder in it I wouldn’t care who would know I drive like an old granny anyhow 🥶
I wouldn’t care if it didn’t work just to have it sitting in my drive I’ll be happy 🙈
Hi, i'm french ,and i love your accent ....i mean without saying the T  😅
there's so many better things to do with money than this, haha
Just sayin but the Bearskin hoodie advertising on here is absolute shite.   I ordered one and it’s a cheap piece of garbage.  Three days in and the pocket ripped out.   A couple weeks in and the zipper started coming apart.   Don’t waste ya money
That green interior is gorgeous!
Everything happens for a reason. Like when I downloaded this video and clicked off, the reason was that you were talking about dumb shit like that.
Good content. But a millionaire asking viewers for money to achieve his dreams of owning a Lamborghini is a sign of personality disorder or something. Lol 'together' okay when do I get to drive it since we're in this together?
Bro we get it.   You are a youtuber.  You took a huge loss on this car.  You made up for it with the views on this video and engagement on the channel.   Don't act like this wasn't a failing task that wouldn't have been viable without your youtube channel.
Yikes
*Slaps strap - "That ain't goin anywhere"   P.S - That's not how those straps are designed to work.
Could drop an LS V8 in place of the V12, if worse comes to really expensive.
Perfect body for an EV conversion!
Great video, cool project 👍
Dude. This is a herculean project. Absolute respect.
7 minutes in and he still hasn't said WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH THE CAR.  One thing I know for sure, I'm not subscribing to this channel.
Learn to live within your means.
M
So I subbed as I’m interested, but I was really hoping to know how much a project like that might cost?
Nice car but still right side drive limits on market but fine for Brittan Japan aus
It is hard to believe that a car like this was let go by the previous owner !
Good Luck on this adventure ! When you do get it all fixed ... it will be Awesome !!  Have you tried locating the Mechanic that was working on it before ??
A What? Marsheelago, Mooshylawgo...  *Moor-siel-ago* It means bat, dingus.
we as car enthusiasts are all guilty of buying with our hearts and not our brains. good luck with it.
It's not wraped, it's the paint gradualy deteriored with Time, and bad stockage conditions ! Good Luck for next work !
Thank God for fast forward. So you can get right to the point. You know what's wrong with this lamborghini well I'll tell you a little bit. You know what I need to do I'll tell you in a few minutes. 16 minutes. To say I bought the car That needed more work because it's going to be cheaper. 6-7 minute video.   Is what the video length should be at the most.
What did you pay for the beauty  ?
Lost me at “even. more. riskier” 😂
Oh you bought it with your head alright =\
for the sake of that "mercylaagow" that I really enjoyed every time  murcielago is pronounced :  moorcee ela go
You gotta take off the wheel to get to the battery!? Italian engineering at its finest!
I enjoy watching your vids mate! keep it up!😎
something about this dude is so annoying I can't watch him
Let me guess.. its actually a pontiac fiero with a body kit?
how many times can someone say MURCIELAGO in 16 mins
He could make it an electric vehicle that would be cool
HOW CAN YOU NOT LOVE THIS VIDEO??? AWESOME STUFF MATE
Too many words in my opinion. Way too many comared to content volume… 😣
So funny the way Mat pronounces "Mercia Logo" :D
I just have a question. If it`s abandoned how did u buy it?
You bought an Abandborghini!
You didn't mention how much you paid for it
Stop telling us your going to tell us why and do it! Ffs.
Bit frustrating he doesn’t say what the inside stinks of….cat pee….Karen & Tracey pee ?
🟩🟢 BRO, .. IT WOULD BE A DREAM OF MINE JUST AS WELL.. A MAN CAN ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING....AND REMEMBER.. ITZ A FUKIN MERCY 🔥😀 TAILORED AND CUSTOM EACH ONE  WITH ITALIAN DETAILS.. GOOD LUCK ☯️🕉️
As soon as you’d said “I’ve bought one”, I broke out in the biggest smile.  Great video!
it's mur CIÉ la go, not  mur cie La go
what an idiotic placement for a battery. True italian electrics.
0:51 that roar reminds me of my golden school days
Im convinced this is forza horizon 4
Is it just me or does Mat look like 'Dynamo' the magician!
He keeps saying evryfing
There is No we in this video that  guy is doing all the work and your just the cameraman... only blah blah blah
The abandoned quote is a bit of a stretch. Welcome to click bait I guess
Can't wait to watch this journey
Buy audi r8 engine amd you done ;)
Great stuff
It’s amazing how no one can pronounce Murcielago properly…
What is this goonzsquad UK?
Thats awsome not everyone gets the chance to buy thier dream car even if its broken 😢 but by looking at your car some parts may of been over tightened thus bending some parts inside of other components thus making them tight to move at a serturn points it could be an easy fix but we won't know until you open them up .
How much was it
Check for shorts before you power it up after replacing this resistors!  Check all mosfets and zero resitiors.  :-) good luck
I couldn't watch this to the end because Mat Armstrong's abuse of the English language aggravated my senses too much! If it was simply colloquialisms I could accept the errors, but his misuse of plurals, adverbs and tenses drove me to distraction. ("..more riskier!" rather than ..more risky!). What little I saw I enjoyed - the sound of that engine!
meh I could fix it
Room for a 12 valve swap hahaha
Why do I feel like I watched this video years ago but it’s only a month old…  Tripped out rn
a busted lambo? and Ed's not here? woah
Love this vid! So cool to see your dad working with you. Best wishes from NZ!
I can’t wait to see more. Just subscribed 👍. Your also living my dream brother!
I just find myself flabbergasted that you didn't argue the guy into selling you both for a song.
Ill fix it
Such A positive video and person itself! Love it! Mat, would be great to understand how much such Lambo was purchased for  and it would be even more interesting to understand final stage and final cost if this beauty will be completed. Subscribe straight away. Greetings from Lithuania.
How much man
Matt is a very likable Bloke! GoldwingMikeNY 😂
Sounds like the guys you got it from are a bunch of idiots.
Mat is literally showing the world how it's done. Can't imagine where this channel will be this time next year
Crazy to think that people spend so much money on these cars only to find Audi logos on it. LOL
Just found your channel. I spent 25 years customizing cars, machining custom parts, adapters, etc.., and wouldn’t have hesitated to buy a project like this. Love your attitude and the fact you talk in crayons for those who may not understand. I’m going to follow to see how you finish this project.
Well definatly a favorite model & color yet never thought I could afford the parts so didn't need to make a selection.  So lt was fun to watch like   geting my e type decades ago & finally grew out of it as it will become part of my 1st prototype design wiith name out of several others
If a motorsport Nd car business could not sort it then. Good luck
looks like young jeezys old murci
We would only consider you lost the plot if we knew the price you paid ???
I wanna Lamborghini too....
Yes, def childhood dream car 😍 (though it was a gallardo poster in my room, I couldn't find a Murcielago poster). Liberty Walk on it, full black and it perfectly fits in in 2022. Gawd I need to stop working as an employee lol
Ill buy it as is!
Just put a K24 in there. 😂
Cool that you are taking on the project. I just don't think that you should have overpaid for it.
Love your channel Mat! New subscriber from Ireland!
"more riskier" is not a thing
Saw a vid with this Laser tool cleaning everything to pristine on a car. Had dreams about that growing up use a 360degree Laser to clean the house.
The rrrrrrrr noise
Rubbish- but still cool
Following this project
To all who have pulled that trigger 😁
Say moo -si -a - la -go .that was the saund. murcielago
Finding Audi logos on it 🤮
Sounds like mechanics quit before being fired.
4 mins in and I’m hoping he turns it into a sick car bed 🤘🫠
one hour of "I'll explain in a minute."
Nah I’ll keep my money ya pleb lol
How much u buy for?
Too many adds...
I like the bit where he says  "but other than that"............. WHAT??? and how is that wrap going to come off ?  - with extreme difficulty
Check out "Fixed Until Broken" on YouTube.  He fixes instrument clusters.  Might be able to help you.
Don't care about cars, repairs, racing,  mechanics, but God damn this channel makes this stuff interesting and entertaining. Well done.
Lamborghini merci your bitch she be thirtsy
Forget the v12 and drop a big ford in it and go fast.
Moor-sieh-lagoh. Pronounced. Murcielago means bat in Spanish.
LS swap
All of the Armstrong that I’ve seen are smart so far
Put Tesla motor and battery pack in it
"so my dad found something ....that goes to show how good my eyes are "   sure thing buddy .... sure thing
Every car mechanic could have fixed it but ok
that's great bro!
I hate the color
Ed China 2.0
Just subscribed to your channel as the this lambo story got me interested as love cars! My first car was a 205 gti 1.6 then my second car was a 205 gti 1.9 then my third car was? Yes u guessed it a 205 gti & so on, own nine all in, but back years ago when was cheap to buy, my dream now is to turbo my 106 quiksilver gti conversion!! Going to do a channel episode of the process wi$h me luck dude! 🤔🤙
I had a rented mustang in that color once and I thought it was disgusting.
Maybe it was in the gumball, Bam and Ryan Dunn entered and killed 1 of them cars. Beat it up bad. Maybe the owner was in the race and did same.
100k paid too much mate should of paid less
Merce logo... 😂
I hope the price once you've finished rebuilding the Lamborghini it's at least the same price as one in perfect condition would be and hopefully you'll make some money
Dude i’ll buy it. Dont give up.completely worth the work
I could fix it in a week 🤣
You're such a loser
You didn't buy yourself that car  your YouTube people did you loser
lol Pretty sure an LS swap would be a first. Uphill battle regardless of power plant. Good Luck Man 🤙
That sounds like a car that was recycled into a parts car for other Murcielago. Basically, fixing a bunch of other Murcielago with minor issues by replacing their defective part with parts taken from that one (which explains why there are missing parts all over the car.)
Congratulations bro I love the risk it’s all monopoly one love sporty Ontario California
Slap a 6.2 LS and be done with it🤣
Easy fix, replacement engine Toyota V8. ✅
What kinda loser are you? Can afford a lambo, then beg viewers to help you fix your own car, on a vid with over 2m views.
How much did it cost though??
would love to see one of these converted to Electric... might be easier to do too XD
Its all about the journey
I thought he was gonna get the Lambo and be like oh they never put down the e brake that's why it wouldn't move
Mate it's awesome!!!!!!. Not sure if I can bare to watch this though... 😬
Just put an LS in it
I’d LS swap it!
That looks exciting. I hope its only those transistors that need replacing, can’t wait to see the next video
right hand drive??  wtf i luv it those- but your gonna do a swap- its gonna cost ya. But you did your HW. good job
Wow let me sell you a car lol
lamborghini drivers use mini coupers to haul them
I will forever be indebted to you you’ve changed my whole life I’ll continue to preach about your name for the world to hear you’ve saved me from a huge financial debt with just little investment thanks so much Mrs. Williams
How much was the lambo?
Lol is it just me or does it look like there's fire damage on the wheels?
My dad bought an old car and it was in that condition and after 3 years it's on the road.
omg get to the point already !!!!!
The main difficulty with fixing cars is the price and availability of the parts. I think this was a huge mistake :p
He could of asked Phil Morrison from driftworks, Manchester
Mat, maybe the cluster needs re-soldering I had this problem before easy cheap fix that the big wigs didn't even know about. SMD conversions are the people I found by chance. 👍
Where are you finding these cars
Matty , Matt ,Matt , Gotta say mate, "You either know your shit or full of shit." I talk slot of shit, so I can tell it's the former ! Having said that, You couldn't possibly fail with the support you have from your SUBSCRIBERS. They are to COOL. ⛽ THERE IS not one useable car emoji..Stevo from STRAYA C..NTS
Amazing!! I'm surprised you can walk with the size of the brass balls you must have!! Thank you. Really enjoying this.
My worry would be that after 7 years of laying around in a shop and different mechanics around that different little parts and pieces were salvaged to repair a different car or parts lost so you can pretty much guarantee that thing is far from complete
I've also been crazy enough to buy a taken apart and left to sit for untold time  so I know the complete blind leap it is to do that but it was absolutely the only way I would have ever been able to own a Ferrari even with working on them professionally but its not the cost of buying the car its always the cost of ownership of vehicles of that level... it took me about 8 months to get it all back to how it should be and i was able to enjoy it for a year and then i had an opportunity to make a decent bit of money on it so ya I sold it but hey I was kinda paid to enjoy driving a Ferrari for a summer if you look at it that way lol  I have been looking for another project to get into but I'm wanting to find a basket case GT3 rs or something similar...  Good luck to all the crazy ones willing to take that chance because most wont and sadly most of the ones that do wont be able to finish the thing...I'm just telling it from the things I've personally seen working with exotic cars for 20+years
I was a technician for a large euro and exotic car dealership and I was a certified Lamborghini technician as well as Porsche lotus Ferrari jaguar and range rover/land rover  I was injured and I'm not able to do that for a living any longer but I worked on them for many years and would love to help you in any way if you need it ...
I seen you will fix it temporarily then it will be broken again. Later I will have to fix it I completely redesigning everything. It will be years from now before I can work on that. I know that help that smell is horrible first thing I was going to do remove everything down to frame though I would be redesigning the engine and all the instruments. Hopefully you get rid of that smell before I see it.
Anybody who has a 1/2 decent job can buy a 20 year old broken shit Box  And then this guy went and did it   Very few people give a shit  YouTube recommendation error at it's finest...  There are very few people on Earth that care about this kind of situation or want to watch this guy name drop
Just discovered your channel. Love the content, you have a new sub
nice parts car. you gotta nother one to rebuild with it?
So how much was it? All this talk about this one being cheaper and needing viewers to pay for this thing and doesn't mention the price, meh.
I subscribed just bc u nice *ford owner 😂😅
Love how he's towing his Lambo with a Rover
16:00 hi to you too.
Win a price by counting how many times you hear Mat say 'Murcielago'.
We all want to know how much you spent.
Mersha-Largo, hahahhaa lol
You've got a lot of pain coming.
How many times you gonna say "Murcielago in a youtube video, this guy YES YES YES YES.      GODDAMN
man i'm amazed that you are excited to do this , when the camera showed the engine compartment it took me to the days az i tried , (and tried is more accurate then succeeded ) to rebuild an aircooled ( cooling plates ) porsche 914 , all the wires and extra parts .. oh no .... where do i start ... i did rebuild that 914 , and on my triumphant test drive allz well ... and you guessed it ... transmission , gone . good fortunes , will be watching , peace t. davis
Good on you mate, you can do it! I subscribed!
why would you pick the good condition one? not only cause that one is manual but how would you make a bunch of video out of a running var and get your money back ? there would be no point
Dreadful cars. Nightmare to work on !
This guys teeth CRACK ME UP
I popped the hood and the entire engine was missing!!!
Carvertical sucks.
I only discovered this channel today I subscribe to lots of other car you tubers but only found you when I was looking for v12 Lamborghini rebuild. I love the Murci its my dream car too!
Matt just found your station while recovering from Covid. Love your enthusiasm buddy! I restore 1rst Gen Ford Mustangs here in Florida. I’ve done about 12 of them. Have 2 In the garage now. It always comes down to air, fuel and spark. We all know that. It’s a bitch cleaning up another persons work sometimes. Not always but yes sometimes. Keep all the basics in front of you and over time Sherlock Holmes will find that clue! Look forward to the next episode.  Cheers 🎉
Sorry but realism over optimism, guessing this is likely to go back together about as proper as a JDM drifter, in the end not desirable to a legit enthusiast.
I need help with my car fixed
Iguy in Miami use a drifent engine on his unfixable Lambo
Damn, I would have just gutted it and made it all electric.
You can’t afford one but your driving a 100k Range Rover to tow it
It's a cool color.
How much was it bro
I love this content...can't wait to release mine
Let's all chip in...like everyone  else on YouTube that now own nice stuff..  let's pay for this guy to get his dream car🙄
For a small portion of the video I can barely hear Beethoven’s 7th
😂 1 manpower Marcielago
Btw sex is overrated.
How much did you pay?
How much
I would clean it and park it in my driveway and never move it. Lmao😂😂😂😂
Are those real teeth?
What do cheap Lamborghini's and Unicorns have in common?     They dont exist.
How awesome though bro, that's your now! 🍻🏆Motivate the hustle.
Birth year lambo yes sir I’ll be watching this all the way through
Yall are the best, yall got this.
Awesome! I think I will buy a car I cannot afford to own run of fix and ask strangers to pay to do it all... What a douche...
Yes, let’s all help someone else make money.  Don’t tell me you can afford to by a working lambo. Talking shit.
Need to find out what caused those resistors to burn out or it can and will happen again
Wherecthe next video to it being restored
can you show the hole rebuild of the car? love to see you do this
If you look at the MOT history on this car  between july 2006 - july 2007 it traveled over 31000 miles in a V12  Crazy
Seeing you explaining what's wrong and missing, but still smiling with so much enthusiasm and excitement is worthy of an top gear award!
See Gumball sticker in door jam...slowly walk away.  Not sure "bargain" and "Lamborghini" can go in the same sentence.   Sure, it might be a parts bin car, but you have the "Italian" tax stamped on the front bumper so...A loose chain/bad tensioner caused my friend's 06 touareg v8 engine to go boom 💥.  of course his lack of action/maintenance probably had something to do with it as well.    Good luck in your adventures.    I'll check your progress in fillow on videos....
Love the car good luck to you just subscribed to see what happens next.
It appears you're just a social media actor without proficient auto mechanics capacity. These types of exotic car full monty restorations are better left to the likes of Americans. IE Jay Leno garage
There is more stuff burned on that cluster motherboard.  Microscope is best way to ger a close up of parts on the motherboard.  But the next best thing to use is your Fhone. If you use your phone on photo or video you can zoom in onto the board and look over it and get a really close look on your phone screen. Try it and youll see what i mean
murciElago try pronounce the E stronger so you can actually know how the car is really called cause I couldn’t understand what you were saying hahaha it’s Spanish word for BAT. Good video btw!
Not long subscribed 2ya matt&im already blown away by ur channel,u av sum big brass balls my friend,lmao.Seriously tho u r brilliant m8&love what u do&how u document ur videos bro!Keep up the hard work&may many more hit that sub button.Stay safe bro.😎
Way to go bro you got this.
This car is junk..
Wow after reading these reviews you reminded me of what it's like to risk it all and use your hustle to manifest your dream.
Wish I was working I'd send you $10 or $20 because I think your genius and desrve to manifest this 🎉
Does he ever say the price?
New drinking game every time he says Murcielago
When I hear someone with a British accent say something like, "more riskier," I'm surprised. After all, you speak the Queen's English, right?!
HOW MUCH?
I'd destroy that piece of shit car in my Honda civic. That's a fact
Ls swap it👍
🤔 uhhh...how bout Price u paid? 👀 don't worry, i won't tell the others 🤫🤐
your can do attitude will go along way i so think u can make this work and makes for great content . U got this Matt. and we are all along for the ride.
honestly would be more exciting to know what he paid for it to put it into a financial perspective...
Don’t know how I found this but clicked out of curiosity. I hope you complete this car, it’s just beautiful. Good luck and best wishes. 🇺🇸🇬🇧👍
Bleed time, that's all I feel like happens these days 😪
you sold me liked and subscribed from North Carolina USA.
I dont really care if these lambos are working or not. I would just take them because they are cool
Nice car! Loved the vid!
That's like a 1/5 scale
Did you mention the price or did I miss it in the video?
The difference between you and a normal person. Intonation. I'd lose my mind living around a bunch of English wankers
I know what's wrong with it, the steering wheel is on the wrong side.
That’s a nightmare if I ever saw one.
Tavarish could probably fix that
Where Do I know this guy from and how come out of all the videos on YouTube is this video playing?
What does the stink smell like...ya have us curious now...?!!!
I’m happy for you bro, I know what your saying when you say how long and much you have wanted one. I love them the same. Even if it doesn’t run, you still have a Lamborghini .
I brokered a few Murcielagos in my 30 years of car career, I’m glad you have the battery disconnect switch in yours to avoid spontaneous combustion. Best of luck with the rebuild. Keen to watch the progress.
Just put the big new 600 something LS in it it'll be cheap to fix and those things put out a thousand horse easy toss that engine every time it breaks it's going to be a nightmare and a headache and expensive it ain't worth it
If you knew someone in Dubai there is lots full of these sitting and rotting for parts man it's all about who you know
You just say: "riskier".
Still wouldn't be cheap
YOu've got the right attitude.  Good luck!
id rather a honda fit than this garbage heap
What can you say? Man's dream is man's dream
You want the public to pay for your toys? That takes a lot of nerve. Get a job like everybody else
Extremely well made video, your editing is on point and your narrative bits are perfectly done. Glad I found the channel.
Nobody wants to hear this but if it was cheap enough to begin with then a big-turbo LS swap would be kinda cool.  No wicked V12 sound though, but still cool.
Good luck
You bought a lemon that will cost more to repair then if you'd buy a working one😬
Game: Take a shot every time this dude says Murcielago instead of just calling it a car.
I think this guy knows exactly what’s wrong with it but he is making it seem terrible so that the previous owners don’t feel bad 😅
Let's see the cost m8
nice
Im not sure if you are very brave or just certifiably bonkers but its made me subscribe!!
the whole never stop smiling (ever) while talking with your hand's bit gives me used car saleman vibes!?
👤💬it is the best one
You could probably shorten the video by 5 min by not saying I tell u why I bought this car but not yet
👤💬Goooooooooot dammit!!!! ITS NO DAWG!!!!!
Subscribed
Nice video. SUBSCRIBE 👍🏾
At the very least you can film a cool rap video with it.
You look like tony Robbin's
I would have bought it too !!!  Probably would be divorced but I understand .  Good luck with this rebuild! I look forward to seeing it finished.
Greed can be an excellent teacher to the right student.
Murcielago has the accent on the "ie" part, not on the "lago" part.
You should have bought the yellow one !!!
Abandoned Lamborghini? All we get around here are abandoned Bugattis!
How much did he buy it for?
I hit both buttons! Great find and great vid👍🏻 That right hand drive would be worth a fortune here in the US😅
stick a hemi in it
Hope you make it run and shine again bro …murcialago is my own dream…I’d rather have one murcialago than 2 aventadors 😂 Edit: I have same murcialago car toy in exact green color…since my childhood I’m obsessed with that shape and sound…
Rebuild with electrical motor instead normal engine
I wish I had a father to work on cars together.  That's so cool 😎
Junk... and the steering wheel is on the wrong side 😂
I downed a shot every time you said Mucielago …….     I’m drunk
Get a new digital dashboard itll look better
You are very brave looking forward to seeing how it turns out good luck.
You HAVE to wrap it in purple! That green interior with a bright purple exterior will look nuts but awesome.
how much you pay bro?
Everyman racing is the perfect place to buy a car from, it’s never been thrashed as they don’t let you lol
Throw in a Nelson Racing engine in and gut the car.
I can never get past the mitsubishi eclipse air vents and steering wheel on the older lambos
only hear the back round music.
Ferrari, Lamborghini, Jaguar, Mercedes, Maserati, BMW and so on... are shitty cars. I have owned most of the ones I mentioned above, they all suck. Not very good quality. Porsche howeverhas been a great car.
What does it smell like?
If it was abandoned it would have been free no owners
Cheddar cheese
I'm just wondering why the car was taken apart to behind with
So what did you pay? in US dollars please.
So , what did you pay?
Hell put an ls motor in it lol
Boring
Find me an older Gallardo pls that I can fix.
With tattoos all over hands and arms. No comments.
Lmao, this thing wasnt abandoned, it was fucking stolen
Will you be turboing
This while setup is so fake
How much did you pay for the Lamborghini????
There's a big difference in the words WOULD and COULD.
oooooh carvertical, lithuanian company. its an honor to hear it sponsors you mannn
I remember this car, just found my pics of it when I drove a Gallardo at Everyman racing in 2011. I remember wanting to drive the murcielago instead but couldn’t change. Have a fab day that day, a surprise treat from my fiancé the week before our wedding, got to drive a 360 spider and Gallardo around the track, was a great experience!
You have a great channel, showing the right content & info, happy days 👍 🚙💨✨
Can't believe your channel finally kicked off
You just need to jack a mint one, strip it, and rebuild the one you bought easy peasy.. The hardest part is finding a cheap broken Lambo that hasn't been written off cause obtaining one with clean registration and good body and interior the rest is easy and it's enjoyable driving around hunting like a predator for your prey Lambo that you are going to abduct and dismember there's so many ways to abduct it one of easiest ways is to do it by the help of a tow truck especially if you know someone who owns one but if you don't you can still be smooth enough to have a random tow driver take it somewhere else where you can then get it started and drive it to your secret location to dismember the bich and if you have troubles getting the vehicle you can just wait like a predator in close range of the one you have perfectly selected and wait until the owner comes out to drive it and rush up on them and briefly point the Glock at them and take the key and order them into the driver seat and get them to drive you to a non populated area in the direction of your garage then get them to pull over and get out and switch seats then you blind fold them with a balaclava on backwards and zap strap their wrists and drive right to your garage and drive it inside then order them out and guide them to the passenger side of your vehicle and drive them back to where you had originally swapped seats and blind folded them and then get out and help them out of the vehicle since their wrists are strapped behind their back and then get back in and speed away making sure you don't have your own plates on your vehicle you need to have stolen ones and you also should go the extra mile and apply some cheap window tint to the passenger side window where he will be sitting with a balaclava on his head to avoid any suspicion you can pick up a roll of the tint film almost anywhere probably even at Walmart and to apply it it only takes a few minutes since your not needing to do a perfect job you just mist spray some water on window hold the film to window and rub it on with a random plastic card that you would have in your wallet but chances are the Lambo that you are going for is likely already going to have at least 35%-40% tint already on its windows so you wouldn't need to apply any yourself and even then someone seeing a person in the passenger seat of a Lambo wearing a balaclava they wouldn't notice that its on backwards and wouldn't care either way cause it's 2022 and people just don't give a shit any more I mean a guy literally gets on a subway train or Skytrain car and rapes a woman in front of dozens of people and everyone just told themselves it's not my problem so you could probably drive by people with the Lambo owner hanging out the window with hands bound and blind folded and people would see it and say sucks to be them but he's probably rich and can afford to be kidnapped and extorted or whatever is going on I was just thinking tint the window if it's not already because of my OCD when it comes to pulling off the perfect hiest or Jack moves and you don't have to feel guilty because the owner will be insured and as long as you don't have to assault them to make them comply it won't be too traumatic for them because sometimes the poor need to steal from the rich to enhance their own life experiences its not right but not much is in this day and age so fkkk it pull out the strap and give me the key and get in and drive what's yours is mine mentality life's a bitch man deal with it and a few months later you be rolling in your mint Lambo lookin dope AF and so like Nike just do it.. over and out 🖐️
Now i could care less about Lambo's. BUT i think its awesome, that is a dream of yours and you took on this task to restore something that is broken to something that you will drive and enjoy! Best of luck mate!
Couldn't pay me to take that green turd.  Let's see how it turns out buddy.
Audi and 350z fake Lambo engines wreaked only
This is goals, the repairs will make it more worth it in the long run
Put a k24 Honda motor in it
I subscribed lets do this!
👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Here's some more help! 😉
This one I want to see how it goes till the end, good luck Mat 💪🏻
Two words describes You! , positively wicked ❤
You kept repeating the same thing over and over and over again
For a supercar it looks so cheap to me inside
Madlad! Doing what everyone else would love to do but isn't brave enough to do it!
Wow sounds like some rookie hands touched that thing before you got it yikess
nice car
lots of parts from Beatle and other VW cars..  Which makes repairs of what should be expensive parts, rather, well less expensive. Not really Cheap, because VW is not cheap, but .. Not so bad.
Man i like your videos but when you pronouns murcielago like murshielago i fell in rake sorri😂
If Dave is helping you this. It won’t be a problem! There’s noting him and his shorts can’t fix!
how much was it then? jeeeez
If all fails with the lambo engine, drop a LS in it and call it  a day
Worst car creator on YT an absolute wet Mary of a man. He says one more time but we'll get to that imma flip.
I can’t wait to see the results!   I’m not really a car guy but this video kept me watching ! 😂
Ed and Tavarish entered the chat
Soo I'm sure I'm not the first to ask this but how much was the car exactly? I must know!
Easy, motec dash and a lsx 8.1 v8 swap witha. Bell housing adapter
Great video ! Maybe I missed it but you never told us what price you bought the Lamborghini at that's sort of defeats the purpose of following the whole journey of repairing the Lamborghini ...Music and editing make it look like a tv show tho great job
I want Lamborghini too
It's absurdly infuriating how many people can afford a laboringhini.
Best content on Youtube
Looked like 2 yellow & 1 green.
Barn finds:  29 model A, 31 model A, 55 bel air, 56 bel air, 57 coupe de ville, 59 MKIII convertible, 66 Chevelle Malibu, 67 Galaxie Convertible, 70 boss 30w, 75 bricklin SV-1, 78 Eldorado Biarritz, 84 Corvette, 87 Mustang gt convertible, cb650, GSXR1100, etc...
Price
"abandoned"   nice click bait....i guess it worked
I used to work at Everyman racing 7 years ago can remember it being parked up in the corner and left to gather dust, be good to see it back to how it used to be
When you said all the things that are wrong with it and all the things that are missing, I would say you got a parts car. The parts that are missing were sold. Bad move on your part.
Go for it good luck
Go electric or not
Good luck that car looks like a right shitta
Guy buys a Lambo, says he's broke, then asks people who can barely afford to heat their homes or buy food to give him money to get his $300,000 car working.   Do people lose their morals when they start making YouTube videos?
Good. Luck. Thanks for sharing 😊
Bonkers ! This is going to be brilliant content, I wondered when you would have to do an engine rebuild but lets start small.....V12 !
What’s so hard fixing it break down the engine take you time reassembled it if it takes 5 or ten yrs look at you tube get lot of education on it if you can’t afford original their always remakes after market I stay with motorcycles much easier to work on
That’s always been my dream car since cannonball run
Need part 2 of this video
Beautiful car
Hearing the poor lambos name butchered is always cringe 😬
Nice Video, though I cannot stand this kind of english accent too long ... what's a Morshalaago?😜
Can't wait to see it fixed nice find
Really happy for you dude! Can't wait for the day when I'm buying my first one😅
For want of a diode a supercar was lost :/
blown 427LSX swap
Yep it's not that hard. There's a lot you can do when you have plenty of money as you do. Nothing special here
Just found your channel and freaking love it! Over here in the U.S.. God bless brother!
its hideous but i subscribed anyway
My mechanic neighbor back in the UK had a lambo that clearly needed work, and they did eventually get it running. Was a thing of beauty.  Kicking myself for never asking them about it, they just seemed kinda unapproachable :(   Probably because before that point, I always had the faster cars.  Kinda figure that's why they got the Lambo. lol.   Soft spot for Lambo's and watching this with interest :)
How does a car like that end up in such a sorry state?  Such a shame with any car let alone one like that.
I was going to say, check the board on the cluster for burned bits. The surface mount components can be replaced, locations marked R10 or C14 for example R is resistor and C is capacitor, you also have Diodes which often pop because of a miss connection, likely a few bucks and an electronics guy and she's back in business 😉
Did anyone count how many times he said murcielago?
Video killed the radio star and the dealer will most likely meet the same fate
it wont be just the resisters ,the will prob be some high speed dual diodes and mosfets to replace as well ,possibly a voltage rectifier stage too,if the cluster was fully reverse powered
Seems like a good opportunity for a Ls1 or ford racing crate motor swap. Zero maintenance cost. Otherwise seems like a money pit.
It needs a good 351 ford engine don't have to worry about any engine failures
The fact that you bought it shows that it wasn’t abandoned, it was owned by the person that you gave the money to.
The fact that you paid for it means that it wasn’t abandoned, it was owned by the person that you gave the money to.
"ABANDONED "  sure it was...
Just randonly found your video! New Subscriber here! Look forward to watching this journey man!
I'm a new subscriber from Los Angeles, I'm hooked, thank you.
Matches your earrings
Who does one pay for an ABANDONED vehicle?
should have bought the other one like I said. edit: in a rush I put the jump leads on my e46 the wrong way round, it can be done, even like me with 20yrs in the motor trade.
The money raised from YouTube should help you bring this beast to life.  The relays on the cluster will most likely be the issue. They more than likely burned out when they tried to bump it the wrong way
You sir, have my subscription.
Dumping money into a money pit has to be a labor of love.
I can relate  I have just a 20 yr old jaguar  and everyone screws everything up
Easy fix you got it bro 😎 just a expensive fix but all good easy to put back together
Epic work. Subbed.
Matt ..I'm curious how much was it compared to the yellow one ?
Just don’t turn into Andrew tate
Says everything like it’s a question. What a mug
yawn
How did they get the log book if it was abandoned bro?
lol what a load of BS who the F abandons a Lambo gtfo dude
Put a Chevy V8 in it… 👍🏻
if you have to buy it its not abandoned.
he starts talking about the problem around 8 minutes, the timing chain has stretched and the motor seized after fixing it- dislike from me for all that waffle upfront and after, this video could have been five minutes
Put a ford 5.8 efi to annoy people. That's a fun truck engine.
GO FOR THE ELECTRIC CONVERSION!
Its funny how you pronounce murcielago.
Live life to the full
just ls it and be done with it
@ 4:51 why are you unable to speak without having a ridiculous smile plastered on your face the whole time? You own an obliterated Lamborghini that's 20 years old and doesn't have an engine or transmission. It's in tatters and it looks like a joke and you're behaving like you just hit the lottery...get a grip. Your behavior is just so disingenuous
I hope you got the pos free
Don't even like cars but I'm hooked. Good luck. Just subscribed
Bro you straped your car down wrong... Strap crosses slightly above the middle of tire . Forces the car down to the bed.
2jz swap it
Make it all electric like a Tesla
buy them both lol
Just put a 350 in it and call it a day. Still looks cool lol
Stop saying mershilago its merci lago
Put a Tesla EV  drive system
Yank what you don't know  and  go with what you know
Honestly, isn’t it crazy that totaled cars still need to be “bought”. These cars have practically been disowned by their makers so yeah we shouldn’t have to pay for totaled cars.
Everything depends on if it's worth repairing.
I’m subbed!  I need to see more!
Money pit no ?
"to keep my head leveled" thats rare nowadays! glad you made emphasis on that
🙄
You should definitely get a hold of tavarish over here in the US I'm sure you know that he built an awesome Murcielago it was one of the ones in a Fast and the Furious movie
Good fun but please please stop saying what  that car is …we know it 👍🏻
I remember seeing a Lamborghini with a 350 Chevy in the back so I could drive it but slowly build up the v12 until u begin the transplant via the horsepowef
At worst it could be a beautiful boat anchor. Rooting for you!
For repairing electronic stuff like this, retrace what likely happened. If reversed polarity power was applied, look at where that power comes into the PCB. Assuming you don't have schematics, physically trace the leads to whatever is downstream of those inputs and test stuff out, or if stuff is obviously damaged, just replace it. Often there will be diodes on these circuits that effectively act as fuses for this exact type of thing...diodes and resistors will be the most likely blown stuff. Transistors (which effectively contain diodes) are sensitive to this kind of thing too. IC's as well....these can often be harder to swap out, especially on SMD (non thru-hole) PCB's. Worst case scenario, bite the bullet and take the thing to an electronics repair shop. If you find someone good, this should be a pretty easy repair for them, even without schematics....it's a relatively simple circuit. Also, you may find you can get it partially working (ie. turns on, lights up, gauges mostly work) but once it's all back together in actual operation, things are off.....maybe a gauge doesn't read correctly, or behaves oddly....maybe there are issues downstream with other components which interface with the dash cluster. Often it's tough to tell the extent of the damage and how far the electricity got into the circuit before it was effectively choked off by a failing component. If you don't do a deep dive and get everything, you may end up having to come back to it and re-diagnose.....which isn't a huge  problem, just something to be aware of. Cool project, good luck!
Put a chevy v8 in it
Things might not be coming on due to missing earths aswell
I WOULD OF CHOSEN  THE YELLOW ONE ..BECAUSE LOOK AT HOW MUCH $$   HAS TO BE SPENT ON THE GREEN ONE
kit car?
@dailydrivenexotics would love to buy ur car
Need for speed hot pursuit vibes ❤️😍
And who cares if it doesn’t work you still have one how many people can see if they have a Marcielago Lamborghini not many
Just stick a different motor in there. You still got a Lamborghini on the outside
Time for a C8 corvette swap
Don't forget that spiders LOVE to live in the gas lines...
I love this guy’s energy 😊
Fuk i may of driven this car years and years ago.....prefered the R8 though as this Lambo didnt drive well
Recorded horizontally:)
Actually not that bad. Really nice find. Anything can be fixed in the right hands. Good luck with ur project.
Good luck with that...
Big powerful 12 cylinder engine you must like stopping at gas stations
Great video!!! Very similar to the Porsches timing chain setup. You’re going to finish this in no time!
Lol. Begging for money to support an addiction he can’t afford.
Guy needs some grammar lessons
😀😀😁😁😍😍👍👍Your kitchen needs can be met by searching for many different categories in the website.
His daddy is showing people how it’s done
Taking the car with the worse problems seems like a no-brainer.  You aren't really buying a car- you're buying opportunity for creating content.  Which one provides more opportunity?
Freaks are in?
I recommend dry ice blasting pretty much everything to preserve the value  of the car.This is a important step in the process.
Man you got totally robbed! You didnt notice ths steering wheel and everything was on the wrong side!?!?
Find out who drove this, who got to drive this car during the Gumball 3000....what famous bum drove your car 🤣🌐😉
This is THE gumball 3000 🥲 good times 🍾🌐
Shoulda just LS swap it
Just drop a Chevy motor  in lol
Top Gear had the same problem in correctly pronouncing the name of this murciélago car. It's moor, thiel, are, go. It's the Spanish word for bat.
PEOPLE SEE VIDEO 1000 HP WANKEL.
When you’ve built that one can’t you buy the other one as well and do that one or both of them done a deal for both
Jesus this is repetitive
This makes a copart car look like its worth buying.
How much was car.
There’s my Lamborghini I knew I left it somewhere thanks for fixing it up you can give it back to me now😂
How much did you pay?
👍
New subscriber great video looking forward to the next.
I know it's a v12. But it is already green. Frankinstein's monster was green. A LS turbo or Helcat swap with a manual trans might be a unique and awesome option. Rims are easy. And there are alot of coach works for the interior. But man, that V12 tho.
Oh man,what a mess,good luck.
Lamborghini, cool color, 6 speed and V12...what more do you need?
preparing for it to sit 7 more years in your workshop
Nice yard ornament!
How much did he pay for this green one?
Is there an English transcript?
put a tesla drive in it
It didn't take me long to subscribe.  Looking forward to how this pans out.
My 2004 Ford Explorer V6 4.0 has been rattling it's timing chains because of bad tensioners/guides for over 100k and at least 10 years now. It's still going. 🤷
Small block chevy engine...lol
What a gloyt nice tash n hat  n earing!
After seeing where the car battery is I am never buying one of those lol
Great video. That will be one awesome car when it is done.
1st video watching & subbed buddy-love it, idk what all you've done in past but I really fancy a Murcie myself & one with v8 Honda K series swap with the whole different intake heads mated for maxed out airflow & 1200 ponies. 🤔😇🥰🥰
Why not make  a  Manual cam cain tensioner  like you can buy for  cbr900rr,s
Where the eff is all this "abandoned" shit these reactioners are constantly finding??
If it’s abandoned, why’d you have to buy it?
So a destroyed odd ball Lambo. Ouch
Just subscribed. What a wicked channel.
Yeah just leave a exotic sit for years. Crazy folks all over the world.🤦🏼‍♂️
Excellent content! I have never taken the time to comment on any video. but I enjoyed every minute of your content and look forward to more!
15:26 If i help you, like you say, may i get to drive this car too, or will it be still just you driving it?
No one is giving you money to fix your car bro. Rule #1 Don't buy cars you can't afford...
I like this dude, deciding to break open the cluster to fix it instead of just buying a new used one hell ya
We wish u luck from the USA (Tennessee/close to Nashville)!!💙💙💙💚💚💚💚
Used to watch Italian mechanics repair them and they were not happy themselves with things.  You need to get a photo of where the timing marks are and realize it's a long valvetrain and take your time.   Regards.
What sort of idiot uses the wrong terminals when jumping?
Looks like a cross between an Audi and a Kawasaki. A Mercylesscargo of a 💰 hole
ls swap and done.
Will you give a price breakdown of what the repairs cost as you go, or a final "all in" total once it's completed? There are so many of us that dream of owning a Lamborghini or some other supercar but could never afford to buy one that is pristine. Rebuilding one could be an option that is more feasible if we have an understanding of what it would take to complete a project like this. Good luck on this journey brother. Being able to do something like this, and with your father, is an amazing opportunity that all of us are excited to watch!!
Put a Toyota engine in it.
How sad.  People dying and starved Ng in the world and "it can't be fixed"!!!
Wow so you are going to make 20 videos of stupidity and dumb wise cracks? PASS!!!!!
MURCIELAGO (MUHR ZI ELLA GO)
how much did he spend on it????
I hope you didn’t pay many pounds for it?
Patience, is the key here , and you have it in abundance,....so upwards and onwards, can't wait to see it runnin....
If it was abandoned, who did you buy it from? More YT clickbait BS.
Imagine jumping a Lamborghini and you get the terminals reversed. 🤦‍♂️
перевод би Українськой би булоби харашо
"Marcelogo" hahahahsha
So basically they blew the Dash in the Yellow Lambo and swapped it out with the Green Lambo to get the Yellow one back on the road
wish you knew how to pronounce the name
murcielago is my favourite lamborghini ever! whenever I think lamborghini this car is what comes to mind. also great colour!
That's okay, I can fix it.
Thst circuit board...look close for burnt. There might be a blown transistor ? They stand up on legs and if one blows it makes a black spot on the board. Good luck
Let me guess, the previous "mechanic" was not certified Audi/Lambo..
cool
😎👍🇺🇸
when you realize 60% of matts viewers are not subbed
How much did you pay for it
Step 1: take engine and car home. Step 2: Discard pasta engine .        .   ..and drive train Step 3; Install either a Sonny's                 1000 Cu In or a SME                 Racing 3000+ Hp                 engine Step 4; Cease all other power                 source concerns....
Sitting there since 2015 all you older peoples let that sink in 🥲
Mad respect.  I bought a Lamborghini Jalpa years ago that took me 4 years to restore.  It was mechanically just devastated, taken apart, and abandoned in a garage.  The interior and everything else was in great shape.  It was a hell of a journey to restore and it was worth all the time spent, it still puts a huge smile on my face.  I had to print parts, fabricate parts, and have some stuff custom machined just to get it working.  In my journey for parts, I was told by a well known shop that works on Lamborghinis, when I called them asking for parts, to "sell the car, they weren't going to waste time on my car, it would never be back on the road, go back to being a hotrod guy, you sound like one."  I guess doing my own work was frowned upon.  After the car was finished, and I had done a full EFI conversion, I was lucky enough to have the wallstreet journal reach out to do a section on "My Ride" as someone had told them about my restoration, so I guess that shop that told me I was wasting my time can kick rocks.  Anyway, moral of the story, take it a piece at a time, take your time, do it right, YOU CAN DO IT, and I look forward to seeing you get it back on the road.  Even if people tell you that you're crazy or can't do it, Lamborghini cars are a labor of love and passion.    I've had the pleasure of driving a murci a few times in my life and they are absolutely amazing to drive.  The howl of the v12, the acceleration, the feel, the interior, they're just amazing cars.  Lamborghinis are an event EVERY time you drive one.  Congrats and looking forward to seeing the journey!  Also you got a GATED Murci, nice choice man.  It's going to be a hell of a proud feeling when you're done.  You might give the guys at bullstuff a call, they've been extremely helpful when I needed weird parts and advice, they're very knowledgeable.  They also have diagrams for virtually everything on all the different models throughout the years.
Truly the gaudiest, most hideous interior I’ve ever seen.
If you cant fix the engine throw a v12 viper engine in it. They put those in trucks, you many find one reasonable to rebuild.
U paid for alot of yt content bruh. Probably gonna spend over 50k to rebuild just the engine/ transmission.
Bad ass car man. You'll fix her up real good.
Note to self; only buy a supercar when I can afford it. Forget beat up mistreated European Sports cars. It's been raped. You can clean her up and put her back on the street but she's always got the history of being someone's abused seed receptacle.
There is something very sad about a Lambo not driving.  Good on you bud, give it life!!
Why are you making the price a mystery? That's the biggest factor. Just say how much you paid for it. This is a major let down on both of your videos. Be upfront with the viewers. This makes me question your authenticity. Feeling manipulated. Are you a fraud?
Nice content i'd say im excited to see the progress on this, goodluck mate!
Curious what you paid for it ….rhetorical, don’t tell me
Wholesome😊 Subscribed!
Thank God u got a YouTube channel or u would have taken a big loss. But still good content
one of the most punchable faces and people ive ever seen
Is it fixed yet?
Ya what a Great car..Too bad the Friggin wheel is on THE WRONG SIDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!..There is your problem?
This got me excited for the next video, great buy brother.
Were the Engine and Transmission Vin matched to the car ?
Put a electric motor on this lambo
make sure that your instrument is grounded
Terrible camerawork, out of focus a lot.. unwatchable.
Everyone is playing Forza Horizon but you are living it lol
First look a thought it was the cboys lambo 😂
just k swap it
What did he pay for it???
Also  do give us an idea when the next video will be up.
I am literally binge watching. You are supposed to be on Netflix man. You can definitely earn more from there and also get more audience. Keep it up. Cheers mate.
Your one brave guy will be watching 🤞
Whata  POS!
Waiting for content coming up
Engine is messed up just put a rotary or something in it 😂
You will need a schematic for that board? Burn resisters are not a good thing, somehow those resistors got overpowered.
Pt2 ?
A man can do impossible things he just need a push/help/support/slap (in my case 🤣) from his father. Nice car and I just want to see this beast back again on roads 🥺.
I want to see more
Bruh held the lambo down by the wheels 🫣👎👎👎
Needs a 2JZ swap
Well you better hurry up and sell it because they're dropping the speed limits overseas and there's going to be no reason to have one of those things and the price is going to drop down below that of a Volkswagen
I think you bought a parts car 😬
0:51 Man just watching the video, it sounds amazing as a Mechanical engineer it's a treat just to see one and to own one! Good luck Mat hope you turn this project in to a absolute masterpiece.
Take a DVM look for shorts and opens on the components. You will have some logic circuits typically requiring +5 and +12 regulation circuits that's the supply B+ ...follow the main +12 input to instrument cluster and follow every trace and I suspect a open resistor fuse and shorted protection diodes they could be surface mount type .
Wow this V-12 equals 2 x 2JZ's
Look for damaged voltage regulation on circuit board
Typically there are some protection diodes and resistors and a fusible resistors.
How much was it ?
Ok, but the fakes accent, is it really necessary?
I sure hope that when he put power to the car and the fuel pump turned, that there was gas to lubricate it.
Where can i watch the next installment of this rebuild please?
he keeps mention a "price" but he never says what he paid for it, which is annoying the living hell outta me!.
just put a Ls motor in it.
Early 2000s lambos HAVE TO BE LIME GREEN!
I have. No doubts that you are going to bring this green monster to life.  It's quite inspiring to see someone acknowledge the daunting task ahead while not abandoning the the job at hand. This is very courageous , entertaining and inspiring to witness
i hope u pay less then 100 dollar for that because its a LOT of work mate
I wouldn't buy anything from men with tattoos that big.
Awesome I’m following 👍🏽
easy: turn it to an electric car
Good luck with the lambo & respect for chasing your dreams.
Where is the other one?  I want to convert it to electric
Good luck with your Lamborghini it’s going to be a long journey but worth it all the best
I'm commenting his current subscribers: 607k. Let's see it next year. I subbed when Tavarish started rebuilding Gallardo, look at where is he now 👌
Mat. You should collaborate with the Chanel , "B is for build" they fixed a lambo from scratch
Salut my friend super car super video subscribe subscribe .....
Ooof right hand drive.. yuck
Why install a fuse when you have resistors? The resistor is the fuse.
Mermoneyalago
See how you go buying parts from Lamborghini 😂
How much did you pay for it? There’s a reason they are abandoned bro 😂
Never buy a vehicle with the steering wheel on the wrong side!
Love it bro can't wait to see if you can finish it!
Clickbait....
So what happens with the green car , you fix it, any video the car running?
He never mentions the price he paid for it, nor did he even rebuild it, don't waste your time.
Hey man I may not be able to come up with much money but if you need anything or help from the US side I'd be glad to help you look for parts and ship em to you .
14:28  Which is what I said before this stupid video even started.
You're the one who bought but I'm the one who excited 😎..this is what i needed to be inspired although money is the issue 😆..i have an old BMW e34,old engine system but manage to restored it by myself..took a whole year to rebuild but I'm satisfied..sadly sold at the End,wish I could have that moment like yours again to rebuild something from scrap
11:01  They took it out to use on another car.  Amazing.
If I was there I would be all in with the help....
0:50  That's not a roar, that's whine.  Worst sound ever.
Wow, vey very brave or knowledgeable man.
Imagine putting the battery cables on wrong on a Lamborghini
Circuit board soldering is a tricky one. If I'd get it right I could have saved every t.v I had thrown out
how much u pay for it?
Just found you, watched first video, and subscribed. Let's get this Lambo done Son! (and Dad)
So like...what we're the prices of both?
Mat, I can only understand the sastification of bringing a car back to life instead of buying another functional one, there are not those feelings of accomplishment and the pleasure of seeing it drive afterwards😁 Good luck in bringing your dream back to life and above all the opportunity to correct the few serial defects and improve it...  Ps: Put a diode on the dashboard power supply, it will prevent the same problem!!!😉
The car is getting great gas mileage for now.
Too much filler. Get to some content. I tapped out
Signature doors stolen off a Toyota
We already know why this is. "[(IT'S CHEAPER)]"!!! And I myself wish you all the luck in the intier world with your skills!!! Cause sweetie your going to need it!!!! Cause when you stuff all that tech into such a small space you'll quickly realize you have to do this before that and that before this and still have to rethink and once more replan your approach then again!!! So as I said "[(GOOD LUCK)]" for I truly wish to see that baby girl back running and setting the road ablaze once again!!!
There is a trend to put a reliable Honda engine in cars like this ;)
my guess he paid $40,000 USD for it
Reason for swapping the instrument cluster could be lower mileage on one . Even though the true mileage is still stored on the computer . The purpose being to bring the value up with lower mileage ?
Frunk
Was this Prestwold Hall? Pretty sure I might have had a go in that green Lambo around 9 years ago!
I heard Jay Kay had special body numbers stamped on his collection.
We all have dreams like you man. Good luck on your build and utilize your help, because you have it. Cheers
I need to self build a small house, your project makes it seem ok :) amazing project, best of luck
Well that car is a perfect candidate for conversion to electric.  You have plenty of room for battery storage in the old engine box.  Good luck however way you choose to get it on the road. 👍✌🏻🇺🇸
hell i wouldve just put a 4 cylinder and a exhaust kit on it LOL
I’d say fair play , I’m gonna enjoy this :-)
unless the cluster was direct wired to battery or bypassed to a power source THERE isn't ANY WAY for it to short it out Someone didn't know how to build a car .... LAME CAR with that kind of problem... All instruments of the car have to pass through a fuse box first so it doesn't blow the instruments
my dreamed car
how much 💸 for both?
anyone know the song starting at 1:30? I recognise it and it's bugging me
What do we get back when we give you
How is a Lamborghini abandoned? I don't think that's possible in the States.
Man you should have the car fully detailed as you figure out the problems....🤙💯
Ha ha no way .. about 2 mins away from me
I really enjoy watching your content man you need your own tv show
All the best with your build of the Lamborghini, will be interesting to watch your progress , cheers , Mitch 👍
My dad hated all my hobbies and interests :(
Subscribed! Lets see how this turns out :D
I dont know where you found this car but im gonna guess it wasn't in the US,  cause I don't think nobody would abandon a lambo even if half of it was missing.  If you did , im gonna scratch my head 😅
Lucky man. Getting your hands on a Lambo
I hope so 🤞 how much did you pay upto now though?
This is cool man!! I also like the Lamborghinis man!! One day I've rented a Gallrado for 1 hour here in Barcelona!!
Less talking an more working progress !
Wonder where them mechanics work now? they sound like a right nightmare!
Am I the only one shouting clean it at the screen?
Goofy ah Bat named car
i hope you got it super cheap
What was the car called again.🤣
2022 wer ist noch da ?
Morcilogo
replace that engine with a north star v8 save your self a lot of moneys
Good video Mat
very nice. new sub
I can't listen to u butcher the English language anymore,also way to rely on ur subscribers to pay for ur rebuilds...I hope no one pitches in,so tired of these youtubers living off their subscribers while making BANK
LS swap it
Murciélago: Bring be me back to life 💚🥲.
Yeeerrr Mat has finally "lost the plot" GONE MAD bonkers mad I tell ya MAD MAD MAD nuts loopy crackers !!! Now this is gunna be fun isnt  MAD MAT !!
Mega!
somebody once told me the world was macaroni your lambo needs all the tools in the shed. on a serious note i wanna see this thing run.
I have one suggestion.. if your into electric engine drives.. Koenigsegg makes, "Quark Electric motor types to fit the hubs of entrepreneurs in car types".. So instead of a fossil fuel-engine type, the electric "battery system", could easily take the place, if so inclined.
I would have taken the yellow one if all else is the same. No auto gearbox in the yellow one.
The electrics are made by Volkswagen, later ones have engines built by Volkswagen as well.
Get rid of that pasta engine and gm  v12 LS swap
Was that a ferrari gp2 car in the back ground anyways amazing video
Drop a Benz V8 in it and have fun!
I've loved the Murcielago since it came out, but I never hear anyone else talk about them until now
I'm curious how much you paid for the green one vs how much they wanted for the yellow one
How much did he pay for it? that's the main thing I want to know
You can only get that smell out with any ENZIME cleaner
Is it done yet?
Bro is always killing the game 🔥
Took half the video to finally show whats wrong
Fiat Punto engine fixations are similar...try with the diesel 1.4L ! 😂🤣🤣🤣
So excited!!!!!!!!! Lots of content please....ps congratulations Matt 😁
So how much did you pay if you don't mind me asking for the lambo that handent ran in over 7 years, This is something id like to do same color aswell, but shoot i dont dont even own a car now, unfortunately, I had one was stolen so i just never got another one , I let my license go and where i currently live i guess here ive got to go take a school course like when your 16again which seems like a load of crap to me but thats how it is here,
I need a Murci project. Fun Fun
How much was it?
They would have had to pay ME to haul that POS away!!!
Disgusting car that
Looks like stupid pays off.
love to see you rip the v12 out, and drop in a LSx(big block), toss twin 110mm turbos on it, and build a 1500+WHP beast out of it.
Looking forward to watching this rebuild! 🤘🏼😎
Awesome
Wash and detail it. Move it into your living room.
Made from tons of plastic and you cant even jump the battery without taking the tire off what a piece of shit but yet they were $300,000🤣what a joke maybe $100,000 max lol for the garbage and problems that they have but if you can fix it hell ya shred tire but to go out and buy one new😂you cant even jump without taking tire off wtf lol🤣 not to mention the junk ass lambo doors that never last and will leak at some point and always need replaced also in a rollover… you cant get out unless you can get out the window lambos are just a Name not a real top notch brand they make fast cars with fast engines but with all that comes no reliability at all they will coat you more than they are worth to buy it and maintain the engine and bologna skin parts hit one pot hole and the alignment is off or controll bent lol lets not even try to bump a curb lol hello bent control arm lol… but with all that said i hope you get this turd runnin and take it to the track for a full send thats really what they are for they dont like our shitty normal roads
Congratulations on your investment! My name is Glenn CEO of optimum ceramx solutions. Let me know how I can assist u
Man I can't believe that car was in the gum ball 3000 only cars that got in that have that sticker
I know it's probably going to get some flak, swap the engine out for something easier, v12 jag ?
There's better lo.oking cars to have
It got suggested to me and I never watch carvideo's. Cool channel dude, hope you can pull it off.
MAAAATE Thats some work but also our kind of project. Dave's a good lad too. when you want the wheels restoring dude just shout only up the road and will make them mint for you.
hey was that a murcialago?
I couldn't help but notice when you said "500,000 of us..." mate there's 600,000!  I'm a proud new sub, and this project looks awesome!
I just bought myself a sweet Milky way candy bar! It was good.
You need to do a car meet up of your own. And a link to your music list your videos are rudely amazingly sick bro
❤❤ it’s beautiful 😍 gonna send some prayers 🙏 u are definitely going to get this project going! Dream is literally in sight.  I’m excited to see the future videos in this.
Seems like a super charged Ls transplant OR a monster from chrysler
the problem with the resistors is, you can´t see the value of them anymore, they could be different values of ohms on each resistor. you will need schematics or another pcb, that is working, to check the resistors. good thing: these resistors are very cheap, and relative easy to replace :) good luck!
I need help building one also if anyone wants to help me out...
Buddy. you need to get rid of those ear hoops... because when you finally remove them, you'd be able to hang your coat hangers in them...
Would like to know what the damage bill to buy this bad girl before any more money went into it
Please talk less and need more of car work.
Is the term in Jolly ol England. A Wanker?
I hope you will answer this question Mat please, How much did you pay for the car? I mean NO disrespect, ill will or any against you or the car! Because I know how it feels to have a dream car and you absolutely love a car from your heart to your very soul and I probably speak for everyone here if we could but our deepest love of a car or vehicle that they have deemed of having for all their life and had a chance to buy it even if we paid more than we should and even if it was just the  frame of our dream car or had to piece that car one piece at a time when we could I know I would do the same thing and probably everyone here would do the same thing! To fill that dream, of our love to own that dream car waiting with anticipation for the final day to finally complete it and to finally not only own that dream but to drive and show off all that love, blood, sweat and tears that we proudly had to go through!  Also, to be honest, you will appreciate this car even more because you rescued it, you gave it a home, you poured your very being into it to not only make it live once more!
I've seen engines in the 10k to 20k range good used...
Just LS swap it and make history!
Throw a supra motor in the pos so its worth selling
If it's not just the resistors, look for MOSFETs.
That interior looks like a fucken licorice allsorts.
First video ive watched on this channel! looking forward to going back through all this content!
Send it to AGX avant-garde in California Mark and Mitch I can guarantee that they'll fix your problem with your Murcielago, they are the true supercar Auto mechanic wizards. AGX team are truly Very good at there job. ❤️🔥🔥💥💥💥
I need a body of something look out for a car I buy it
junk lol 😂
My goodness man why would you have to buy it you should have got it for free it's a piece of s*** to begin with and what you got is a pile of s*** isn't worth anything the car isn't worth anything the car isn't worth anything new they are pure f****** junk You pay how many hundreds of thousands of dollars for a new one and you get absolutely 0 performance same with Ferrari same with Porsche that's why I switch to GTR built it to 1400 horsepower nothing on the f****** street can even come close to touching me including most motorcycles... Wives up and get rid of the crap....
Your more excited then a little school girl and I use the same accent as yours LOL 😂 I'm totally jelly
Where is part 2 for this project
The hell with the stock engine ,,,  get with Steve Morris racing engines put the 16 cylinder custom LS engine in quad turbos 2000hp +🔥🔥🔥💯💪
And they say suckered on your forehead for get go
Very interested video
I like your enthusiasm, it's exactly the same way I tackle shit!
You deserve each other!!
Abandon Lambo, yes I find them once a week.
I won't mine driving it as long as it's moving even if it's not fast I can still drive it with a potato engine and say I own a lambo
The instrument panel could be a SMD
I'll buy that Lambo and put in a golf GTi 2l turbo engine just to drive around town
Great project - subscribed 😊
I had the same dream for years, no way to make it happen. I settled for a much smaller moneypit, trying to rescue a 2.0lt v6 Mazda. Not something special but it is for me. Now I only dream for all the useless incompetent warmongering spoiled rats that rule our planet to die and rid us of their existence.
best wishes and prayers you and your pops get this bull back on the road roaring with its beautiful voice again! Whenever I hear the sentence "No one can fix it" or " It can't be fixed" All my brain hears, is no one has figured it out "yet" Nothing is ever un-fixable...just either they cant figure it out, or they don't have the time to, which in this case, the mechanic was told to move on, and then bailed and left the car behind. Worse case scenario, at least you can part it out if nothing else works...but YOU ARE GOING TO FIGURE IT OUT! In my experience a lot of mechanics don't have electrical experience with issues with mobo's or in laid fuses, but you both found the problem fairly fast on that instrumental panel, which makes me wonder if they even looked into why it wasn't working. If he jumped the car with wrong connections or backwards, the car probably did what it was built to and shorted or blew everything out to protect itself from the real damage (even though it still bad)  the trick is now, finding what is blown and repairing it! But I know you will be able to do it! And with a backing of almost 600K Subs, I am sure you will get all the help you need to get it going!!!! Best of luck as always Mat!!!!!!!
Good luck
Where is part 2? I want to see the full restore!
15:40   use the sniff test on the board and see if you smell anything that was burnt.
I can diagnose and repair anything on any boat, yacht, car or motorcycle!
Just put a POS engine in it so it drives lol
Stick a Tesla motor in it.
Smart Move 👌
Man you,ve ball of a rhino, good luck all the way guys 😃
I saw that car stopped on the side of the highway near madrid in the gumball years ago... wow
put a LS in it
Hello from Charleston SC
You lost the plot. You could have got a Morris Minor cheaper!
So how much was the car?
Ever heard the phrase "Bitten off more than you can chew"?
Keep enjoying your life and spending time with your father
go on lad
So the battery is hidden behind the  rear left wheel. What a dumb design. It's very hard to replace the bettery on this thing. No wonder high end cars suck.
Go on Mat! This car will turn out be an absolute beast
If you just want to find out the problem 7 minute 16 seconds Before that all he does is ramble on about how hes gonna tell you what the problem is
the amount of views in 7 days, insane lad
If thats a track day car it's going to have been thrashed. You're going to need a new engine.
Another great project mate looking forward to seeing you do your stuff 👍🏻
I like baes gumball sticker she been around the block a few times
Any damaged part is going to cost so much to fix. This is the definition of a money pit
New Sub here! this will be awesome!
Looks like the shell is still pretty solid and as long as the block isn't cracked I see no issues. It's a VW-era Lambo so you can pick parts out of the R8 bin
Just drop a Coyote in it and enjoy.
Hi
First video i have seen of yours! I'm looking forward to the Michelago journey!! Subscribed!!
Between sourcing rebuild parts this project is gonna take years.
Is it finished yet ? 😊
No one can fix it ? More like... I'm not touching it... If this showd up at my shop. I cringe every time a European vehicle shows up.
So the real story is the guy was told to put a new timing chain and guides/ tensioners on it and rebuild bits. Messed it up, probably because the poor guy was very stressed and then got fired for messing it up...
i could rebuild engine and throw it back together  i can tell you are missing a lot of parts
Hopefully you paid less than $15k 🤷🏽‍♂️
OH MY FKIN GOD.... HOW MANY TIMES DOES THIS CLOWN SAY THE WORD 'MURCIELAGO' IN THIS VIDEO ???????????
I’d package the engine up and ship it to Ian Tyrrell, it’s Lamborghinis own V12 engine and with the tolerances involved you need experience with the rebuild. Good luck though, new subscriber and looking forward to the rebuild 👍.
What's the music used? Soothing
I see a world of pain trying to fix the instrument electronics... Finding out what the actual value of those charred resistors are won't be a 5 min job. Plus, they won't have protected other electronic components downstream which will possibly need replacing - how's your soldering skills ? This is assuming the pcb itself isn't damaged.... You might get lucky on this, but I would seriously be considering buying a 2nd hand one. Just to add: Have a look at Samcracs channel for examples of electrical issues. And good luck !
Just watching hannahs channel.   She seems like a really down to earth girl   Well done matt 👏
This is going to be a great project.. it reminds me of the tavarish channel before heeft us all behind..
Man is playing car mecanic simulator IRL
Mat, very cool find!  I wish you the best of luck with this project.  I think if you paid less than 100,000.00 GBP for it, that you’ll make out pretty good (not counting your love of labor on it).  I purchased a Murcielago about 1 year ago, my dream car and first exotic.  I absolutely love the car!  The timeless low profile and wide body design, the signature V12 only doors and yes, the sound of that rear engine V12 roar through an aftermarket exhaust.   Although, it was in nothing near the condition that your car is currently in, I’m sure that in due time, you’ll be having the Murcielago experience.  Also, you’ll get to build this Murcielago to YOUR liking.  Parts for these are expensive for sure, but don’t depend solely on the used market, a lot of it is way overpriced for the quality you are getting and in many cases more than NEW.  The thing about new parts is that they can take a while before they actually show up at your door step.  There are also the aftermarket products, which can be more affordable than new original parts and in better condition than used.  Great find!  Looking forward to viewing your progress!
How much did the car cost?
Came across this vid on my feed, great video content. Subscribed
OMG dude, I haven't seen you since the S5 - congrats on the channel!!!!
This guy has lost the plot,assuming he did actually own the plot in the first place.
"Have came with me"......
Super cute pup!!
get an R8?! do its pipes, rotiform wheels, remap+filters and etc etc(to match the sound of a mean car)
It's MOOR-SEA-EH-LA-GO, 5 syllables, not 'merseylago.'  It's Spanish for bat, as in flying animal, not a lake near the river Mersey!
I spotted one huge problem right off the bat... the steering wheel was on the wrong side. Man, some real hacks must have been working on that car.
" Hearing that V12 Roar " but sounds like  Mosquitoes..
Ima gonna get my junk tattooed.
Lmao your my new hoovie
It's your fuel map... It's got a nasty hole... That's why your unloading in 3rd...
going with your gut feeling means you will succeed.............peace
I think a new engine is like $25k USD, not terrible honestly. I’m not sure what you paid for the car, but it may be better to just buy a new one. It would be more fun to fix that one though.
for crying out loud what car is it , thought he climaxed every time he said its name
Never watched your channel before, but your use of Beethoven's Allegretto has me at least curious. Nicely done, sir.
I hit the subscribe button and it unsubscribed me lol
Crazy man😅
One word of advice on repairing the cluster (from experience, having fixed VW clusters from the the previous generation and lots of electronics from that era): If you find any chips labeled "ULN2003" in there, just change them out. The ULN2003 is just a set of transistors for controlling things such as light bulbs, relays and the stepper motors moving the gauges in a cluster, but, in my experience, is quite fragile, mainly due to the complete lack of internal protection circuits, and is ALWAYS is the first thing to go up in smoke when a battery is hooked up in reverse. Even if they work fine at first, they will certainly fail down the road, so just change them out or have someone replace them for you if you have trouble soldering that size of chip. They only cost like half a pound, so definitely worth it when the alternative is having your cluster go out on the highway.
We need more on this please awesome new sub here
You're MENTAL!!!  Wishing you the best of luck 🙂
The more broken it is, the more content and better the journey and videos. Make it all the more satisfying when you’re done.
Everyman racing sounds like an absolute showshow... Are their mechanics even qualified
You can always drop the new version drive train in it.
Nice but lots of work there. Can’t help but think only a spoiled big kid that hasn’t worked or earned that must have previously owned it, to let it get to that condition.  People that actually earned the money to pay for whatever it is, never let their belongings end up in such a mess.  Hopefully works out and bring it back to its glory 🍻✌🏼
How much did you buy this beast for matt
This is a journey that needs to be heard......
1:15 what a music you chose! Love it. Not just the music, all this and every other of your vids! Cheers
Look for an Audi RS engine, they should be similar
Man. The nakkaz on you for attempting that.
The only man for a job like this haha! Keep at it bro
Hi mate, I really hope you get the help needed to put that car back on the road, I'm in Australia 🇦🇺 and too have always wished I'd see a day to own one of them,  for me that'll never take place but to see you pull this off would make my day, so good luck and I'll be with you on here along the way.  James. 🇦🇺
How soon till Ed Bolian from Vin Wiki wants to buy it?  Keep up the great work!
So how much did you pay for it ?
put an LS in it.
It's great that you take on these big projects. 💯😁👍
Might be the master chip
This man needs a Netflix Series
put an ls in it.
Once I got to the end of the video where you said there 500k of us who can chip in and help, I restarted the video and let all the adds play through bruz...   If everyone let's ad rev play we can help this man's dream.  LETS GOOOOO  🚘
Subbed goodluck
Did I see a gumball rally sticker inside the door jamb of the passenger side.?.
Stop promoting this rubbish vehicle check website , its totally incorrect and you are promoting people to pay for VERY inaccurate results, Its wrong  and you need to check this before you promote it. I have just checked my vehicle and the results of when its been in my ownership are just wrong. Don't follow this advice.
Just subscribed, keep working on this beast.
Without a doubt the most expensive Lamborghini you will ever own is a cheap one. Even with all of your labor for free AND scouring parts on the internet it is stratospherically expensive to properly put these cars together from boxes. Of course your situation is a different because as a content creator the difficult path actually pays with viewership revenue so I wish you all the best in your re-build.   My channel has a bunch of Murcielago DIY videos and hopefully they can be of assistance. Lastly regarding the the engine do seek out an experienced tech to help you with the re-build. Making a mistake on these engines is insanely expensive so you want to make sure to ask your questions before just guessing on the answer. Best of luck!
Cannot wait to see how this hulk gets rebuilt. 👊🏻
having briefly worked for everyman in the past, good luck lol, customers batter the poor things
Can't believe I've only just found you bro!! Epic video man totally love the true detail into everything your doing. =) subbed
that's some crazy voltage to burn out several resistors at once
you sir.....are  bonkers for getting it....... but i cant wait to see how it goes  man  :)  sending you all the luck
I can tell you the problem with that car without even watching the video. Its slower than a Honda.
😎
LS Swap !
Im seriously questioning why you purchased this vehicle
How much was the car? I watched the whole thing waiting to hear what kind of deal u got on it.
Congratulations on the Lamborghini!
I drove that car in 2012 and the Speedo didn’t work then
So how much did you pay for the car?
Good luck from Anglesey
You can skip till halfway of the video Just repeating the same stuff for the first half of the videos lol
I bet mat paid more than 60k for it
I'd love to know how much it was
Have you thought about doing a collaboration with Iain Tyrrell at Tyrrell Classic Workshop? He is one of the highest regarded experts on the Lamborghini V12 in the UK
Congrats! Just picked up one myself, total dream car!
God, what a find
So what did you pay for it? I know I’m not the only one who wants to know….
What car is this u never said?!
Sell the Lamborghini V12 & manual transmission & LS Swap the Murci.
Like many I drove that same car over 12years ago on a track day and the instrument cluster didn’t work back then!! Dream car, brave man but good luck…
Its green meaning its ecological.....and its really is! All you need is one adult dude pushing at the rear.
Hey buddy I subscribed to help pass the word about your project and I hope we are able to get you enough subscribers to boost your channel and help re-build this iconic beautiful dream car! God bless and good luck
You are young. I am 56 and in my life I have found 3 abandoned Lamborghini.
Been that poster car.....that'd be the countach.
Word of advice mate go get a real job and a life 😊
wish you all good !
It s a car who is not ecologic at all i ll never help you so. You re a co2 fanatic
Man is getting bare viewssss
‘ Is came from ‘ , I think you need English lessons 😂
It seems the V12 in the intro has laryngitis. It whines instead of roar.
Just stumbled onto this channel.  He looks a little in over his head,  and this seems a little mental- it'll be rad to watch this journey! Its amazing what you can do with a big enough money hose, and it can be terrifying when the money hose is too small.
How long it sit 4?
Talk to Tarvarish if you need help. He's done this.  He could point u into the right place and people
I've been building motorcycles (and 1 car) for the past 52 years. This project even scares me!
The power going to the cluster must be checked first. The cluster may be fine. I am a electronic servicer for 45 years. Hooking up the batttery backwards usually blows fuses, or fusable links. Since the entire unit is out , not just parts of it damaged.
if I bought one of those cars I would only buy the shell of the car because the fucking prehistoric engine would leave it behind, or I would give it to the first person who passes by, I would like one of these cars to drive silently and slowly with an electric motor just so that I get from point A to point B in style, nothing more, im not a noisy idiot nor does someone who like speed or racing, nice car, horrible color, and great this Matt, nice guy, all the luck to him and his project 😉
Great to see someone is putting that tax cut to good use 😎
Jees, that's one serious project you're taking on there😳
Buy another wreck with a good drive chain ☺️
cada vez que dice murciélago se muere una persona
This video has gotten me to subscribe!! It promises to be one HECK of a project!! Can't wait for the next episode!!
What did one eye say to the other eye?     Between you and me, something smells.
Do 2JZ big turbo swap :)
If you wanna be successful, you most take responsibility for your emotions, not place the blame on others. In addition to make you feel more guilty about your faults, pointing the finger at others will only serve to increase your sense of personal accountability. There's always a risk in every investment, yet people still invest and succeed. You most look outward if you wanna be successful in life.
Good music! Finally no hysterical music but excellent choice here
Good luck Mat lovin the channel total car porn lol also the way you go about fixing things instead of buying new great philosophy everyone should try at least to do this!
yeah sure great idea...
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Mate, looking into that empty engine bay genuinely makes me feel sick - how, what, where do you even begin?
Absolute legend
Looking forward to this build🇦🇺
Would love to see you and hannah with a million subs
how much did it cost
matt pal I hope you have a large budget for the lamborghini as I suspect it could turn in to a money pit like you said in the beginning, I hope you see it out to the end mate but if you do please get rid of the slime green interior 👍
Moral of the story is everyman means anyman can have a go at working on their supercars. Steer clear.
This is going to be exhilaratingly expensive.
You are literally taking over the game. Please never change.
They jumped it the wrong way because mechanics are 99% of the time totally shit
Just drop a cheap ass Ls in it and you’ll be happy
Quality content buddy you’ll smash it out the park no problem 😉
Lol imagine begging for money to fix a lambo F off,u got no shame
Good luck mate
Just subscribed so good luck on this one it will be nice to see this finished 🥰
Big Effort 💚
Glad for you mate it's your dream 👍👍👍
Is this a manual murcie that's not on Ed Bolian's list? :))
Gross ears!
It also has Gumball 3000 sticker
Wow, a lot of work needed but really exciting stuff. Would it best getting someone else to fix the engine? Then focus more on putting it all back together🤔
Good Luck! BR Fabian
WOW I hope that in some point in life I too could afford a Murcielago
the positive vibes and determination deserve the subscribe/view. Wish you best of luck with the rebuild and you've got yourself a new viewer.
Seems like you got given the dodgy dash
This is going to be an epic series cant wait for more episodes on this
This is awsome
I remeber when this came out in 2002 Directly one of my dreamcars.
Wow.
Nice to see this enthusiasm ❤
Just found your channel, and it seems very interesting. I liked, and subscribed, and wish you good luck! VERY cool car!
And to top it all you have a Boston
Was Ratarossa messing when he posted this will have a Tesla motor in it?
This feels like a discovery channel show :D
Matt - Talk to the guys at DDE! Deamon rebuilt a gated Murci - several times. The guys a legend and knows all there is to know about gated Murci's
How much did he pay for it?
Man go see an optician. Hope you have very,very deep pockets 😂
Love this video!
Ok, sorted. But how to fix the bigger failure that car has, a steering wheel in front of the passenger seat?  FFu-a factory fuc..ed up.
That's a huge job..hopefully replacing the blown resisters in the dash will fix the problem..deffently subscribed and looking forward to seeing your progress on this...👍
Going to be the best build yet. Shame it’ll take a while.  Did I miss how much the car cost in the end ?
Scrap the stock ecu, link up with Drift works get a aftermarket ecu (preferably motel or Cosworth if they have a option, ITB's and headers then let it rip
Love your vids mate
8:44 I respect your honest for giving it the Money Pit key fob. At least you're going into this with your eyes open.
....am I the only one who thought " he's going to need a bigger unit !? " and of course, he's al;reday got a bigger unit lined-up! This one will stretch us all, however the good things is its pretty basic technology , compared to some of the computer controlled nonsense around nowadays. Its going to be a journey ;-)
Good luck
man sounds like that racing company has some terrible techs
Ive been watching this channel since nobody knows anything about it and now 780k views... Good job MAT !
Put a audi 1,9tdi engine in it 😎
Looking forward to watching this all the way to the end 👍
This was just a good start as Tavarish his Lambo back in the days. Started to follow and looking forward to this series! 👍
Sounds like you should have brought both lambos for spare parts😂😂 let’s see how this goes
What I don’t get, that a business that’s running supercar experiences can look after a car like this and just treat it like dog s**t. Terrible.
Subbed !! What's your outtro music mate
Put an LS in it
Throw a LS + big blower, it should run :3
Bruh just 2JZ swap it 😂
Ok I subscribed to see this build and liked you video explaining how you get to this point with houses and YouTube 💪
Good luck 🤞🏽
I mean apart from absolutely everything being knackered on it it's a minter
you haven't lost the plot u bout it cos u make videos out of it and u make money out of it.
I enjoy watching videos like this im currently rebuilding a 1997 Subaru Impreza that a friend owns he’s got a parts vehicle but I’m in the same situation both vehicles are half stripped the engines are in the vehicles but both engines are half stripped of all the external parts so I’m having too find out how it all bolts together
Definitely would suit a TESLAGO CONVERSION
This car need engine form BMW! And all problems will by solved.
I'm guessing the amount of views paid for most of this car .
If the resistors burned, be sure to solder two of rhem with double value in parallel on each place, so you can half the current and hope in future the resitors not burned again. It is definetky a constrution failure of the pcb... and this mistakes often on this supercars. I mran all of them are trash for a lot of money.
It is so amazing that no one else in the world could fix this car in 7 years. Not even lambo themselves, truly amazing that you are better than the lambo engineers. Thanks for sharing.
Sorry !! the burned resistors are more than likely the symptom not the cause.
Certainly the project of your life Mat
Don’t normally comment but seriously can’t wait to see how this goes 👍🏻👍🏻
That's so brave to rescue it.
Omg u bought  the green pos would've went with the yellow one bro it's  closer to completion
I am so happy to see that some people love these cars so much that they are willing to rebuild one in such condition, but I hope that you will do this, just don't abandon it, Good Luck👍
The yellow one would have been boring content that’s for sure. This one is gonna be great 😍😍
I did one of those driving experience things in Vegas last weekend and I can only imagine the cost in maintenance costs… I was sideways in a 750+ hp mustang 550 Gt supercharged every lap I went.
Let’s get you views and subs to fund this rebuild!
Having visited many remote areas in Scotland. Glad you stress "leave no trace"  Though lighting fires is a trace 🤔
Compró un coche para piezas el bobo.
Never get rid of the murci 😭
You should nickname this build "no mercy"!!
Murshalago
Bit of an over simplification why it was left, it was left because the company paid no tax on the money spent on the cars finance and effectively got to earn the value of the car, insurance and any interest paying no tax.
If we all help to repair it ..do we get a go to drive  it when it's finished ?
Such a good channel
I need a Sunday session of catch up of this
When you have a fleet of super cars and beginner level mechanics ......... really sad to see this beauty in such condition. I hope you will be able to bring it back on the roads.
Started in a TT… got a “cheap” Lamborghini… Stradman story v2👀
Did anyone commenting on here drive this car at the experience events?
what a horrible workshop, looks more like a scrap yard :-)
Good luck to ya mate, love the videos, always interesting, admire your drive and enthusiasm to take on a challenge 👍
get some sponsors you might need them 😉
Get a infiniti/Nissan
I hate myself for suggesting this, but I had a premonition where you, Tavarish and Ratarossa put a Tesla motor in this very car.  I'm going back to my corner to rock gently and contemplate my life.
interesting , But I love Fast EV's .
Put a audi R8 engine in !
Just swap it with 2JZ or LS. And that's something nobody has done it yet.
If worst comes to worst, you can always go for an electric conversion. . . . . . . .
Sell the engine and turn it into an EV…..😉
I don't understand why some youtubers can't take few seconds of their time and learn how to pronounce their car names the proper way. It is a not a marchalado. It is a Murciélago. It takes 5 seconds to learn this word the right way.
Why bother, it's not a real Lambo.
I mean if it was abandoned there would be no one to sell it so I don't really get the title
You were smart to buy the green one, because green is my favourite colour!
Tesla conversation?
@travish might able to help u
Good luck
if its abandoned why did you have to pay for it ? not judging just curious.
For smell get few buckets of water chop up oinion into say dozen soak em in car overnight. Is paint smell trick in houses
Something doesn't sound right with this. A track day company, with onsite mechanics, can't fix one of their own cars?  A car which cost hundreds of thousands of pounds to purchase, and they leave it sat for 7 years, which amounts to 7 years of lost revenue?
EV conversion needed lol
Good luck! big project
Vinwiki be like hmm interesting..
You should ask Tavarish for some help if needed his Merci rebuild was sick
A customer of mine has just got himself a 2003 model with 25k on that hasn't run for 2 years, I'll tell him to check this out ✌️
Great video and good luck with project and I get why you want one
Buy Fueltech and solve all the electronic problem. It will be much more cheaper than fix the panel.
You should be in TV Matt, fingers crossed for this one
Matts counting on 500,000 people who don’t have a clue about merchelagos
could you possibly sell it as spares? you make make a profit & then purchase 1 thats not so knackered. As for the instrument panel, the resistors may be easy to source & replace but if 1 of the Chips has burned out you may not find another off the shelf as there possibly custom made . good luck with your project buddy.
Holding my fingers crossed for you, Matt!
Every project car takes 10 times more money, time, and effort to fix, than you anticipate
In a prestige car , there should surely be short protection build into the electrics ?
‘ more riskier’ is bad grammar. More risky, or just very risky.
Omg wish you good luck with that, 🤞👍
oh Boy...
Not far off a million views in 3 days, your killing it bro
You talk too much. More action!
Looking forward to the rebuild of this very much.
“Do you see a problem here ted?”
Where is the warehouse from which you bought the lambo? I wish you good luck 👍
Have I missed the price of the car.  Surely that’s the most important and interesting aspect.
Yes Mat, looking forward to this one, what a story already 👍🏻👍🏻
I had a quick look at that instrument board on freeze-frame, adjacent to the blown resistors is a bank of voltage regulators, they will need checking with a diode range meter. Also any diodes in circuit with them too. There looks to be many ic's on that board too. some of those might also be toast,  and, more worrying, the same issue may well apply to the main engine ECU,as that will also have been subject to the reverse polarity accident to. Try to post up a clearer photo of the instrument board, as that may help.
Somewhere accross the pond Ed Bolian woke up screeming...I missed a cheap merci....
Oh you have to restore its originally colour Matty!  That original Lambo pearl green is an amazing colour! 😎
Thats gonna take ages but when it's done it will probably run sweet for 2 weeks before something breaks 🤣. Still worth it. Merci life ❤
So why was it abandoned?
Cool... Lookin forward to this one 👌
Fair Play mate…..Love a challenge for sure …….Cant wait to see the work gone into this one
Great video I can’t wait to follow how this turns out! Ed bolian will be watching this I bet! 😅
<3 super project car Man!
Love the look of these. Prefer them to the newer lambos, especially in the lairy green!
Why pick one when you can have BOAF😂👀
I can't help but feel like you were peeling the paint off thinking it was a wrap X_X
When a shop gives up on a car, it’s usually a total lost. You got scam
🇨🇦😎I just hit the subscription button....   looks like fun.   Maybe DDE'S Damon Fryer would be intrested too...
You should electrify it!
Would be a good gt build
I bet this lambo will becoming bruce wayne lambo
Coolbeens
That Murcielago is going to put you in the poor house lol
Chain tensioner goes brrrrrr
Do a rb swap in it
Manual good investment I think
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Maybe my mate vince know how to fix the instruments
Seen sneak peak on @ratarossa. Awesome fella
If you can fix this consider me very impressed!
Matt, just subscribed to the channel. I gotta see this out. Saw the thumbnail today with Ratarossa and Freddie and clicked on your channel. Good luck to you on this car. It deserves a 2nd chance and I hope you can pull this off. I'll show this to my wife. The Murcielago is her dream car. Wanted one in the worst way, but the engine out servicing required for basically anything major, quashed it. So she got an LP Gallardo. But she'll always 💛💛 a Murcielago. Good luck buddy. 👍👍I'm pulling for ya. 👏👏🤟🤟
I drove this car !!  I have pictures of me stood with it on the day from about 8/9 years ago.  My missus bought me the experience and it had to be special booked as the murci didn't always attend the driving days.  Also, the clocks didn't work on the car when I drove it, I remember pointing it out in typical Italian fashion
4:39 hey, I have those same air vents in my 2004 Fiesta 😂
How long had it stood 🤣
DDE would buy it
Merci's are among the most boring Lamborghini's made - but it's still a Lambo.  and it still makes *that* noise.  Approved.  @matt
it's italian not good waste of money 👎
You deserve it hard work pays congratulations Thats my dream car too i gona watch all the procces it make the videos more interesanting the fact is disassembled
New subscriber here!!  Can't wait to see it get rebuilt so good luck Mat.
Typical experience day car. What a skip
Well done Mat, inspirational bud 👍
no the difference between normal ppl and u is, normal ppl dont make irrational decisions based on views and likes, and other difference is; this channel is sponsored so it costs nothing
Gonna have fun building that engine back up 🤣
good luck, Mat, cracking show, very genuine 👍
wonder how much the yellow one is?
✌🏼
Congrats! This rebuild will get you seriously famous
Cannot wait to see this…👍
That tensioner is the same as a mk6 golf R with a cdl engine
Yeah now this guy will go on top of YouTube
Genuinely balls of steel.
Seeing you explaining what's wrong and missing, but still smiling with so much enthusiasm and excitement is worthy of an top gear award!
Best car channel out there by far, the range is still my favourite build, absolute gaols right there range towing a lambo  Keep smashing it 👍🏻
Boite manuelle 🔥👍💪
Channel just gets better and better.
Don’t show this video to Ed Bolian.
I just spent £550 on tyres and MOT snags , I thought I had a money pit !! Fair do's that's a brave purchase. BUT , a big but , that clip at the start of your film of the black Mercialago blasting past , with the noise!! Once you are hearing and experiencing that it'll all be worth it. Good luck!
Why is he still surprised vinding VAG parts on a VAG car ?
kick its ass buddy. new sub and hyped to see you turn this beauty into a pearl.
Loving the content Matt.. I’m sure all 41k of us will be following the build! Keep up the good work! ❤
This looks like an interesting journey
He will wack out a pagani zonda in a few years time.
wWotever problems you come across dont worry because you always sort anyway...Also dont forget our lord jesus christ ....
Can you say what you paid for the car?
This going to be epic. Either an epic failure in which case you will learn at an exponential rate, or an epic success in which case you  will learn at an exponential rate. I don't see a down side........ Oh wait no you will be a lot poorer!🤣
Unreal decision, gonna be mint once your done with it
Car rental place have some shockingly shit techs 😅. What was the price on the yellow one pls?  Btw you are brave and smart and I’m sure you will succeed again on this. 🤜🏼
I've gone back time and started watching all vlogs from over 2yrs ago and working my way through to now. I'm now upto Feb 2021. Wanted to say to you who haven't gone back that far to watch (saving her life with an R8) Why? Because it show you what a good man Matt is.
Wish i lived in the UK i'm struggling just to find a E30/E36 coupe right now.
im genuinely excited when you post videos ! cant wait for all the videos to come !! great pick up
YES I WAS WAITING FOR THIS WOOOO
Looking forward to all your hard work Mat 👍.
The only advice i can give to you , is contact Tavarish who completed his project a few years back and will soon start on a second car.
🍺 Good luck🇬🇧🇬🇧👍👍👏
This is gonna be awesome
Clearly a money laundering business… no one leaves a lambo for 7 years.
can’t believe i found this bloke because i wanted to find out how to fit angel eyes on my bmw 118d and now he’s rebuilding a murcielago😭
can’t believe i found this bloke because i wanted to find out how to fit angel eyes on my bmw 118d and now he’s rebuilding a murcielago😭
Get a new virtual cockpit instrument cluster made.. there’s a company that makes them to your spec probably cheaper than oem standard and will look 10 times better  Can’t remember the name of the firm but they were on car sos with fuzz 👍
Here we go, along for the journey! Glad I found your channel!
This looks slightly challenging Matt....best of luck!
Every time you have any engine problems you have to pull the motor out every time
Subscribed to your channel a few days ago and have now done all the R8 and Bently collection along with a few others. Brilliant content, great editing, and love the straight forward talking. The Greek Villa vid was top class!! Fair play to you for being you. keep it going and best of luck with the Lambo!!!
Money pit 😂😂😂😂😂
MAN GIVEWAY MONEY TO KIDS, u wast ur dadys money
Bro, I really wish you a good luck with it and please - document it all in details - here on youtube ;)
FYI, the buttons in the centre console are for the adjustable shock absorbers. It's a KONI system. But maybe you already knew that.
It looks as if every single part needs replacing or polishing... Scary project, good luck
Yea can’t beat the Ford side repeaters on a 200k lambo  And I’d say alot if the switch gear is Ford Matt
Give bba reman a call they are specialists at repairing car electronics and instrument clusters
I would check the cylinders from inside. If they have cracks or scratches, you will never get a healthy working engine.
Awesome videos makes me want to fix up my fiesta
So how much was is for god`s name?
Yet again, Mat brings his A-game. He must story-board each episode to make them so interesting and professional-looking. I love the fact that he's always thinking outside of the box - e.g. his wide choice of backing music to help set the scene. Everyone else just goes with mind-numbing drum & bass that has no emotion other than mental robotic enslavement. Not Mat, he cleverly mixes up classical with a wide array of sounds.. That takes confidence and creativity. Mat never blindly follows the crowd, he sets the pace for others to try and keep up.. in every aspect of his channel.. Well done dude.... Live long and prosper
good luck it's going to be a big job but worth it in the end
New sub here. Nice to have a decent channel owned by a Brit. Will have to have a trawl through the back catalogue when I get a chance.
My mates say I’ve lost the plot but they still love me😎
Good luck Mat, knowing the level of work you do it will be a great car when finished.
He left because he knew what a shit show of a place he was working at 🤣😂
Yeah bro you should of swerved this lol
Needs a v8
Awesome!
Can't wait to see the progress on this build!! Also, did you figure out what's causing the paint mismatch under the wrap?
i can not wait till the day i own my dream car and it will be next year i really can not wait and good luck with your build mate youve come a long way
I am a French ferrari and lamborghini specialist, and did rebuild an entire 100k km Murcielago engine... Don't hesitate if you need info, I might be able to help ! Oil pump definitely weak... Cheers and keep it up
Hope u paid 5k for this thing, it's so bad
People who worked on this car before seems as absolute dilettantes... Also the worst possible promo for the company. I feel like i gonna cry when you take your Murcielago on a roadtrip to Italy. Wish you all the possible luck to make it happen!
i only just about know how to fill up the windscreen wash and oil in a car 😂 but this channel has me hooked! - love seeing someone take on a huge challenge and overcome obstacles, learning all the way and coming out the other side both with a success and so much great experience for the next project! - love it
Things Mat Armstrong could rebuild : The Roman Empire
So why didn't they just change the chain tensioner
NorthridgeFix is your electronic guy ....
Pre-LP car is absolutely fine as long as you have the manual!!!
Be at 1 million subs in no time with this beast on the channel!!! When you done this one go get the yellow one!!! He’s and hers 😍😄
i would be checking the surrounding mosfets as resistors dont really just go pop but if a mosfet has failed it could be the cause of the burnt resistors good luck on the journey!
Wheres the BMW⚠️⚠️
Better off putting a LS engine in it
You can get instruments panel circuit board rebuilt, gear box re build too. Good luck and look forward to shows
Well done mate 😊 You the right man  for this car
just in case you want to pronounce it correctly, the emphasis is on the e not in the a. Cheers!!
Stoked for you man ✊🏼 when you get a new project I always think about the exact same thing that you said at the end of the video. It wasn’t long ago that I was watching you work on the Audi TT and Q, your homies Tiguan (who is also killing it and doing the same thing), the bmw hatch, etc etc haha it’s been so awesome to watch in real time, and it gives guys like me the motivation to put in all that work because we see it’s actually possible to get to that level you’re at.  Can’t wait to see what you do with this thing, and knowing that you have the same taste in builds that I do, it’s going to be ridiculous when it’s done 😍 possible LBW? Or other widebody? 👀
Im super happy for you mate, my best regards from Chile.. Looking foward for the new content on the channel 💗
First video since I saw you on the smallest cog 🧨🧨 Drivetribe the new plug
Oowee
Maybe you should ask for help from the Swede Peter Bjorck
What about keeping it to the caymen.  ffs this is pure BS of a show.
Im going to say chasing the problem with the dash unless your good with electronics will be a pain.
but what did it smell off ?
😂 I really wonder how badly it must smell they way he keeps saying it’s stinks in there
It has potential, ;-).
All i see is mr beans mini lol same colour and a little bit faster evan without a engine lol
You just know Matt and the gang will work their magic and turn this unloved Lambo into an absolute monster. It’s gonna be a great watch.
One of the most difficult projects for sure, Mat and I am very curious to see how you will pull this one off 👍👏🏻😀
Another one to look forward to watching Mat. Good luck trying to find out were all of those parts go. Awesome stuff.
Big ups.
great video
Yes mat gona be a belter this. You da man!!!!
Bring it to Serbia my guy and me gonna make you a car bro
Hi mat great videos really li9king forward to watching the lambo stuff just a quick question... what editing software do you use I've built a supercar garage and filmed it all the way through and I want to put it on YouTube
What a channel this has become 👏
Hi Matt I’m not a great fan of Ferraris and the rest of the super car type motors but watching you go about tackling your Porsche 718 as well as this Lamborghini is the type of content where you wish the whole rebuild was completed in one episode you can’t but long for the next instalment best of British with this one!
How much did you pay?
Would love to see a jdm project, like a 300zx or a supra
Wow matt. Good luck with this.  Stradman levels coming 2023!
Mega video!!!!! love the speed of this video!!! The content is killer!!   Keep smashing it mate!!
Murci's engine and shape 10/10 everything under the skin. JANKY, welds electrics.  Is a better kit car than before VAG got a hold of them . Countach was the worst under the skin.  This will come out great once Matt makes it better.
Honestly amazing to see how far you’ve come i remember finding your channel just when you were under a 100k subscribers,here all the way with you, its awesome what you’re doing! Goodluck❤
Really enjoy your vids mate . Great lad !
wow🤞a bigger and more cool project 🙋‍♂wanna help definly with this one🙃...go matt
👍🇦🇹
You should send the cluster to the YouTuber iFixit….Ok, he’s in the US but I bet you he could replace all the burnt out resistors, all for the cost of postage and some UK Chocolate 😃😃😃
Fairplay Mat, if anyone can give this Lambo a second life, it is you mate 👍
Great video Mat, as always, looking forward to seeing this one progress. With regards to the dash, I used to repair dashes that have been reverse polaritied or spiked on a daily basis: The resistors are just part of it, if you can get a multimeter set to diode test and check all the diodes and capacitors around the connector, you're looking for a "000" short circuit reading. They're there to protect the dash, and if you find a short circuit, whip the component out, the dash should work until you can get a replacement soldered in. Fingers crossed you'll get it sorted 👍
You got this brother just take you're time it will be  Worth it Once you get it fixed I got faith in you
So glad to see that you picked one of them up to fix best of luck fixing it brother
this is going to be exciting
You mad man
This is going to be a good one, but please say your getting rid of all that green!
I could be wrong but ugh I believe it's a 0mile Lamborghini as their is no motor in it lol
Gee I also liked it instantly but your job is not easy sir..
You're able to rebuild this car and you know it. Can't wait to hear the V12 on the road again. Come on man! We support you 💪💪💪
im happy to see this project of yours, running wild. cant wait! ill always check next episode of this one.
I've never watched a rebuild of yours from from start to finish, just dipped in here and there. Totally hooked on this one though, looking forward to seeing it as it should be and all the drama on the way there! Good luck 👍🏻
Well done m8 taking on the lambo balls of steel 👏 👍
How is it possible to a car without any damage end up like this? 🙃
Best man ever !! You help me keep my dreams alive with this smile dude !
Mat you literally are an inspiration, love watching your videos everyweek. Remember back in the day when you used to do vidoes on your white e350. Keep it up pal
I've got to say this Lambo looks bloody rough. Can't wait to see how it turns out 👍
Yes Mat this is going to be epic. Hell yes you’ve lost the plot.... that’s why we watch n subscribe........ wonder what madness is on the way??👍
16:08 some video with that Škoda fabia I RS behind you ?
Mat we all know that if u didn't lose the plot a long time ago we wouldn't see these cool videos now 😂😂😂
How much ffs. And what was the difference between the yellow and the green. As t least tell us that.
Really nice????? The colour I don't think so
Worse colour in the world. And the seats
This time next year Mat buys an aircraft carrier that needs 'a bit of work'. Will it fit in the workshop?
I need all of you to help me rebuilding it, yeah f you mate work for your money and do it yourself, or do we get after it all a piece of the car? Dont think so…
Hi Matt, just want to say that you have given me great inspiration to work on a car myself. I recently bought a CAT N Bmw M135i 2016 and will be working on fixing and going stage 2!  Thank you
The cluster should be Okay the resistors on most circuits are to protect against the rest of the circuit chips and what not from getting burned out  although so are the Fuses but they have probably been replaced already
Dull question...how do you go about insuring the cars you're working on? Do you just insure them for full value?
This dude usually figures out how to fix these recks. Most time he has successful repairs in the end of build im here for it let's go
Might have driven that lambo 😯 😯 I'll check the pics. Did notice all the cars were quite poorly maintained.
Oh Matt it’s very brave thing to do good luck 👍
I really want to see this one complete. Subscribed.
You're gonna do it! The Armstrongers have every faith! You've never let us down previously!
How much did you pay for the car ?
as long as you finish it unlike Samcrac whos just collecting junk
Ere we go another supercar 👎🏻
are you going to rebuild it to OEM spec or are you going to modify it ? I assume the best choice would be OEM in terms of the cars re sell value.
Mat! You're mad 😅. But heyho there's only one way to see if your are truly mad.
Imagine just having the money to leave a Murcielago abandoned!
Love your videos on restoring modern classic cars. Porsche 964 next? 😊
Let’s be honest, if anyone can sort this Lambo out… it’s gonna be Mat 😂
I think this was a great choice! Whether emotional or financial, at the end of the day its about the journey with a car you love. Albeit there is a substantial amount of work, but there is no reward without risk and no challenge without an obstacle. In the long run when this is finished, it will pay it self off whether you decide to sell it or keep it. The RS6 is like a Big Mac at McDonalds, theyre everywhere.
Mat you should open a business where you let customers buy a car and pay you to renovate it. you create YT vids and they pay for the car, your work and all the parts. Just an idea. Then you can choose what car you wanna do etc
Go to ferraghini engine and car restorers at biggin hill airport
It is wonderful to see your Dad working alongside you. I was not so fortunate as mine died 66 years ago when I was 4. You really do enjoy trying to take on the impossible, and somehow you always manage to achieve it. The very best of luck with this one !!!
Is it verde ithica or just a wrap
Really looking forward to following this car to the road
A car of legend, all those bits mean you have the worlds biggest and most expensive Lego Technics set 😀
Liberty walk kit incoming?
Here we go! It’s gonna be some build this💨😍
Can’t wait to see this finished
Amazing! Keep going Mat !
Twin turbo Murcielago 🔥🔥
YESSSSSSSS
Bro that’s amazing you earned my respect and sub !
Love the channel but I'm not going to watch stuff via 2 channels. Greedy springs to mind just keep everything on one channel
This is an ex track day car .... why would you buy it. 😕
I CAN'T wait to see the transformation Matt 👊
I can't wait to see how this one goes. Love the content. Good luck Mat.
Looking forward to this one. I say this every time!!! 😅
Jeezzz man make those videos a little longer, seriously thou’ I could watch all day! A daily dose of MA is entertaining although I know it’s not practical with all that goes into these Vlogs… Top man Matt ✊
First thought: “WTF Mat” Second thought: “He’s gonna need to ask for his job back at the curry house for extra cash to pay for this build” Third thought: “fuck it this will be epic”
British TJ hunt taking on a killer project, eh? I'm in on this.
Too bad you're not in Utah.  I bet Paul at Fab Rats could fit a 389 in there.
Glad I found this show! Cheers from the States 😊
Good luck mate
First time viewer and loving the content already 👌👌
I love murcielagos ❤ good choice I’m new but this made me subscribe so I can’t wait till it’s done!!
This is going to be loads of fun, can't wait for the vids!
So happy you brought the green one can't wait to see this build come together
What if you discover there is outstanding finance after you bought the car?
Why does this guy remind me of tj hunt
Well sir you have a new subscriber from the States!!!
He say its great, sounds like it still got hope
Love the video, this is the first one I have seen and I definitely have hardly any advice to give 😅😅😅  The only thing I will say is, be careful touching that circuit board with your bare hands. I used to work on building circuit boards for airplanes and such, and one thing you have to look out for is cascading failures in components due to very small(25 volt or more) static shocks delivered by touching these boards when you are positively(I think) charged. The people at the shop grounded themselves to prevent this, which is actually really easy! That's the only advice I got to hopefully help you dodge possible extra costs in the future. I'll definitely be keeping my eyes on this project. Keep it going man! 👍
Omg another project! This channel is elite!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I can say with quite a bit of confidence come 1 year on you will be doing a bugatti veyron build 😉
Hi Mat. I can't wait to see that beast running.
Car wasn't abandoned it was being stored tho?
Let's get Daily Driven Exotics to buy the other one!! Or TJ hunt
Voltage  stabiliser circuit...and main ignition relay location first place auxiliary relay and main voltage fuse ...
Hi Mat. Loving the content. Funny you bought a lambo from everyman that had been laid up for 7 years as yesterday we bought an American RV from there that had been in storage for 7 years. 7.1 V10 engine. It's our winter project. Good luck with yours
Mr.Armstrong I was first introduced to you by Richard Hammond's interview of you at the Smallest Cog. Then this gem pops up in my recommended feed and low-n-behold here I am subscribing. CANNOT WAIT to see which way you take this iconic automobile!! May wanna give Freddy "Tavarish" a shout mate.... I know he's got a fairly complete Merci drive line sitting in his place, and has thoroughly been through the Merci platform. May be able to provide some insight. Cheers from the States, and Godspeed with this one. I'll definitely be waiting in anticipation
Looks like some job or a collab project with @vagtechnik
whens the next e24 video?
Mat Armstrong going places
Been a sub since the start will you start a donation page where we can donate monthly to help ?
Get a link ECU
I’ve said it before, I’ll say it again how does he not have over 1 million people watching him 🤯
Gonna be a long expensive journey but you couldn't have chosen a better car to take the channel forward. Can't wait for this build series.  🙌
Hi matt I work at a garage and when we have intrument clusters that have gone we send them to actronics may be worth giving them a shout
Dream car!
Everyone just donate couple quid. It’ll defo add up 🎉
For what it’s worth those resistors could be diodes.
Rrrrrrrr 😂😂😂😂
We need us some @Vinwiki magic in here lol
hrdrdrdrdrd 😂😂 great content!
Love these videos Mat, I follow loads of car youtubers but what you do is so unique and refreshing and almost accessible to us normal folk, bravo and keep the content coming !!!!
Such an exciting build buddy, go you!! So cool
Lets do thisssss let’s go … let’s rebuild this shityyyy car
Can't wait for this one, the transformation is going to be crazy
A Lambo is the engine.
Oh you are so lucky,, as we all are, as we get to follow this re build Love lambos, and this deserves to terrorise tarmac again
can't wait for the full transformation of this car
Start calling you Mad Matt 😊 Good luck with the rebuild. I’ll keep watching 👍
Start calling you Mad Matt 😊 Good luck with the rebuild. I’ll keep watching 👍
i think your content is by far the most enjoyable to watch, i think we can verey easily connect with you Matt, big fan mate and coming from me you are are blessed mate 🙏🙏
Mighty car mods would be a good channel to tap into
Exciting stuff Mat, (you’ve got guts, I’ll give you that….) following this one closely! 😊
Wide body GT86  *blink*  Murci 👀
This will even top welding the roof onto the Cayman! Let's hope the Everyman mechanic knew what he was doing when replacing that timing chain and hasnt done anything nasty to that v12. Mat - you are a very brave man! I'm sure this work out in the end after a few ups and downs though!
Clearly the mechanic cannot simply get the job done lol hope Matt can put it back into its former glory.
Used to work for Everyman, very racist company
Even though it was cheaper, does seem you’ve got quite a big project ahead of you. Can’t wait to see the process on this car.
If anyone wants to abandon their Lamborghini on my front drive please do! 🤣😂🤣😂
This dude is insane. Going to be fun to follow along.
This is going to make you big man😍 mate this is going to be sick!!!!! I’m down the road if you need me boy 😉😂
Good luck 👀
Does anyone else Like all of Mat’s videos within 2 seconds of watching.. or just me?
You can get an SMD rework station quite cheap to change those resistors out, I'd be surprised if there wasn't a surface mount fuse or 2 on there somewhere as well that will need changing. A decent multimeter is your friend here.  Glad you got the green one, the engine is already out which is a good start.
Just binged watched a year's worth of uploads what is the tune at end as stuck in my head. Keep up the great content Mat.
get ready to spend about a 150-200k
That is freaking awesome dude! Can’t wait to see every single video you make of that lambo
Mat mate you keep buying more expensive jigsaws 🤣 love this channel, keep it up man
This channel just gets better everytime 👏 well done mat
i think i’ve drove that car😂
The biggest build yet, bigger than the BMW CSL??? That thing will really test your patience.
This is gonna be quite a project
First job. Ditch the colour. I hate that green
goodluck on the build!
Too much green makes it look like replica I would change out side colour
Love watching all your content, amazing to see your dreams come true 👍  hard work really pays off. Epic car can't wait to seen it finished, keep up the amazing work 👏
Can't wait to see this build..and we all want to know how much did u pay for the car ! 😀
This time next year “this is why I bought a damaged Bugatti” keep it up 👍🏻
A dream project and working with your Dad. Something to be cherished. I never had the chance.......well done mate.
This is going to be incredible. Can't wait for it. We'll done Mat
What a beauty   Can’t wait for this Build 👀
This will be sweet ! Maybe the engine gets stuck while turning because he messed up the timing and the valves are interfering with the pistons 🤷‍♂️ I dunno lol but this will be fun to watch 👌
Tavarish will lose his head :))
Been watching Matt for quite a while now, I love the way he chooses cars that require more expensive spares that are harder to find every time…. Few projects down the track he’ll be looking for a crash damaged space shuttle 😂 nutter!
Epic mate…❤❤❤
Literally taking my friends phone and Subcribing your channel for more support 😘
I can have a look, at your cluster, may be able to fix.
Nice car bro
trending at no 18 uk & a new M3 video on MK2 channel cool
Murciélago (Spanish for "Bat") was a Navarra fighting bull, who gained fame after Lamborghini chose to name a supercar after him, to continue the passion .
Big job. Good luck. Deep pockets pal.
Dude what an iconic project, hope it all goes well 👊🏻👊🏻👊🏻
God I wish you had a binge watch for this ! Can’t wait is an understatement.
not a fan of car videos however im gonna stick around to see how fix this thing up :) heheheha
Am actually looking forward to this build. You’re taking your skills to a whole new level… 👊
Man that car was in gumball 3000
I'm nearly certain I drove this car in 2011. Think I've still got the photos somewhere too! Disappointingly the clocks didn't work then so had no idea how fast I was going ha. Good luck with this build!
When is the video going up on  the second channel
1:26 Do i heard him right?
I had a Golf mk5 with a rattle with the chain and it rattled for 5 years when I started the car. Never had a problem with it
Your only going up mat well done 👌
What did you pay for the car ?
You`ll be done by christmas. Christmas 2029.....
bruh. this car is straight up trash. Your gonna sell both kidneys and a leg to pay for this.
Well done Mat, another great project. I'm really interested to see if black paint is under all that green wrap. I'm sure as you chip away at this beauty, it will start to come to life. Great little find on the instrument board with the resisters. Keep up the great work, peace out😉😘🥂🥂🥂👏👏👏👏👏
I am so excited bro!! Can’t wait for the rest of the progress….
You are the ultimate gangsta. Looking forward to this build 🔥🔥
Really looking forward to this! Epic choice of car and also one of my favourites from the past.
Ayy up Mat and Hannah,If it has Audi parts used on it,the parts bill might be cheaper will look good when it’s finished,check all the fuses as well
Brilliant Matt! You’ve got this!! ( sorry but emotional support is all I can offer 😂)
More power to you Matt, the madness is inspiring, you are showing us all hard work pays off.
👍🏼🚙🛠
I love to hear about the previous history of the car and how it was used and abused on track!
3:04 clocked it - LAMBORGHINI MERCY!!!! Looking forward to seeing this come together.
10:09make my day 😂😂
Cool to see your dad working with you and Hannah
Looks like a good starting point/project. Wouldn't be surprised if the instrument cluster from the yellow lambo has the same blown resistors or maybe the wrong fuse fitted. Look forward to more vids 👍
What noise was the chain making?
Nice
Fearless mate👌😎
Yes you made the smart choice and gone for the manuel!!! This is going to be one epic journey
Legend. Loving your work
Just sat down to watch video. What a project Matt well done. This is going to be a very expensive project but will be amazing when done. Can’t wait to see more
As always you're a madman not scared of anything. The OCD in me is freaking out seeing all those parts all over the place i chaos, I would have just put a torch to it so that I could sleep at night. If I was closer to you in the UK I would volunteer my time just to organize all that and catalogue it for you. Good luck and keeping a close eye on you with the bmw, Porsche and now this build. I'm watching you! Good luck pal, you will kill it!
For a Lambo the steering wheel is a bit of a let down
This channel just keeps getting better and better. Dont stop going forward Matt 💪🏻
You should put an sv kit on that thing....
Great Content! can't wait for the project
Looks like those resistors might be just fuse resistors, could be blown off due to wrong polarity as you said.
Fantastic vid Mat, can't wait for part two!!
I'm so glad that your dad looked at the pcb all throught the video i was screaming its a resistor that has blown few pence and it might just fire back to life! If you have the data sheet and i'm thinking your dad probably knows there is a guide to what values the resistors will be meaning you can narrow down what it is. Hopefully it hasn't taken any of the eeprom chips with it.
LS swap? 😂😂😂
Got a new subscriber here, can't wait to see how this goes! Mega!
Amazing project Mat! spot on!
Rebuilding an Audi TT in a restraunt carpark🫡🤔. Sounds like mat is gonna be the new stradman
What’s happening with the BMW 6 Series..?
Right move buying the one needing most work, it's going to be YouTube gold.
What a car. The colour is rank but nice to see the new unit back 👍🏻. Can't wait to see the rebuild journey on this one Mat
I’ve got 100% faith in your ability to fix this car. You are a good problem solver and good at thinking outside the box which is what’s required when working on these types of cars. Go for it- YOU CAN DO IT 👍

Amazing. I have been watching for a bit now and I have finally subscribed. Your content is epic. So much work goes into your videos its mind blowing
Anyone knows the outro song?
Well done mate 🎉
Very cool..  😎🔥
ills sub.. wanna see it roar! good luck mate
What I gleaned from this is the mechanics tried stuff and couldn't fix it so left it not a great look for everyman anyway glad it's now in safe hands
Nooo don't do it! Merci is a dream/ poster car for many people including myself. I live in America/South Florida Miami. Work on supercars every day for my job. Merci motors are the worst most costly to rebuild. Fix one issue, next issue shows up. Motor in/out many times. Hate to say it could easily be upwards $400k plus
Given what the gated manual (yes the e-gear is still technically a computer-controlled hydraulic manual) Mercielago goes for these days, you've got a lot of budget to still come out on top. And no, there's a LOT of Audi in these, but just enough of Italian Lambourghini left to make it a quirky supercar. All lambos after this feel exactly like you're driving an Audi.
This is awesome Matt!! Seriously this content is on another level to the rest out there. Got some massive balls to be pulling this off. Looking forward to the next video and also finding out how the C63 is getting on.
You’re actually insane - can’t wait to see this progress!
that one i could do myself!! pfff it's all minor
Buying and rebuilding your dream cars, can’t beat that really. Nice one mat going to enjoy another one of your builds.🔥🤛✌️
Hi Matt the reason is your content has to be out there amazing and boyoboy you can do this if anyone cane On mk2 why don’t you so building out your workshop I bet there was interesting content and laughs  This going to be absolutely amazing  Well done mat
COOL!
Great video! looking forward to seeing more! You seam so pumped to work on it, as you should, it’s a beautiful car 👊👊
Sooo…. It cost how much????
If anyone can do it, Mat can do it :) keep it up!!! ❤❤❤
so are you gonna tell us how much you paid for it? how much was the yellow one?
Go for it worrying times ahead but most of it is Audi
For your electronic 's problem you can send it to "deus ex sicilium" i think he will happy to help you.
Hey Matt, your hard work beats talent tagline is missing "passion". I love your enthusiasm for your projects and your doing a great job. I really hope you can pull this project together and cant wait to see the next videos. Also those tubs of nuts and bolts look so daunting! Im sure you must think so to. maybe you should find a murcialago engine specialist in the UK if ever there was one to help. Have you watched any VAG Technic videos on YT. They do a lot of work on bigger more complicated engines (mostly audi). Maybe they could help???
Love what you do Mat. Will you be finished this by next week??? 😆 🤣 😂
I wanted you to buy the green one , well done bro , can’t wait for this epic project
All fixed that should be worth a lot more that he yellow one though, as it’s a gated manual.
i would love to help on this type of projects, it's incredible how happy you look getting this cars to live again
I think you might wanna go make friends with Iain Tyrrell eh ? Harry Metcalf takes his cars there ? Although I think it might be bit expensive ??
Can't wait for your next video Matt1 Just love your infectious enthusiasm
One word... legend
Congrats bro
This video is worthy of my morning poo viewing
Congratulations with the car!! It is a beast! If it was mine I would buy a LP front bumper it makes the car a killer 😊
Mat where’s your go fund me Lamborghini Murciélago link? You’ll need it looking at what you’ve taken on. Your one crazy man!! 😂
This is the perfect car to build!  Its still a car that you can repair most things yourself just like how you figured out the cluster issue.  I think that it will be a super rewarding experience as long as you keep your cool and dont lose it every time you are stumped.  I have done several rebuilds just like this and if I get stumped and cant figure something out I will just go to sleep and its like magic, most of the time I will find the solution while asleep.  I think that the hardest part for you will be the engine.  Those Murci engines are wicked engines but they are finnicky like no other!  Just take everything in slow calculated steps.  Good luck I cant wait to see how it turns out!
This is a great project!
What is the song that plays at the end of your videos?
Buy an aftermarket digital instrument cluster online. Satnav and everything build in similar to r8
Afternoon Mat, I do a bit of electronics repair and would be happy to replace those resistors if you don't know anyone that'll do it 👍
This is going to be an epic rebuild!!
Buzzing mate 👏👏, this is gona be a big one but looking forward to watching it come alive 💚💚…
Nice one Mat this is an awesome project so happy that you got the Gated version than the E Gear. How much was the Yellow Murci?
I'd love to know how much you paid
so excited to see more my dream car ur doin right heree❤
You're Mental but I love this channel and what you do on it. Total Respect. So you've got quite a fleet now Mat...Are you going to get rid of any of the others? Hats off to you mate I really want to see this one on the road but I reckon this is a proper Money Pit!
I love you optimism mate! exactly at 08:50
Freshly subscribed to Mats channel so a few words from me. The guy has an incredible aura and good manners which is very refrshing. Also his enthusiasm like a little kids is sooo freakin incredible hehe. This build is gonna be so epic and i m happy to help you on your journey mate. Cant wait for the next episode. Cheers
i was hoping u would wash the car just when u got it home
what happened to the twin turbo lambo, did i miss something?
You bought it with your head mate like your every other project. Everyone knows how much youtube pays for increasing number of subs and creative regular content  😉 keep it up 👍
Great project Matt!! I have faith you will finish properly this Lamborghini. All the best!👏💪
Super excited for this build 🙌 😍
If anyone on YouTube can bring this back to life. It's gonna be you Mat, I can't wait to see this project
Going to be a great journey... 👍 👌🏽
Usually the Jumper points are in the frunk or bonnet area as us English would call it.
Hopefully you can find this mechanic and he could help you to rebuild it
Nah I said in the last video I would have bought the green one (I think...I may have said buy both) but I would have choose the green I love project cars. I hate the stress of figuring out what the problem is but the satisfaction you get when you have sussed and completed it.
How many abandoned Lamborghinis do you see not one
Imagine the 0 to 60 in that puppy if you put two electric motors in it 😉
Mat enthusiastic love for cars is amazing great content  big fan from deep state Kenya 🇰🇪 when I grow up I'd love to be like mat 😅
This is going to be your biggest challenge yet! Hopefully you'll get back on the road!
Wow wow F****ng wow Matt. Just watched your video on the lambo, I think you have done the right thing, this could be you most watched and best project to date you have done, it's a pleasure to watch a total armature come good, what will you do next, the mind boggles, 😀
next year: ‘I BOUGHT THE CHEAPEST BUGATTI VEYRON IN THE UK’ …… keep smashing it mate.
What a stupid place to put a battery 🤡
Be ready for 1 million subscribers. Lamborghini's bring all the views
Congratulations Mat!!! You will reborn the Hulk :))
Well done Mat!!!
You have brought a ultra rare car good job
This is going to be a legendary build.
tavarish would be proud
At the risk of incurring the wrath of many onyour channel, I'm not a fan of Murcielago's. That said, I will enjoy watching you shed blood, sweat and tears getting this green (for now) monster back on the road. Good luck and thanks for sharing.
That car is epic even when broken.
Good luck mate. BTW that green is awfull!
When the next video is coming?
This time next year Mat will show us a door and proudly proclaim he’s going to rebuild the Ferrari 458 it came from. Living the dream mate!
How are we sure the engine isn’t completely damaged
Love the Lambo... but how's the Porsche coming along?!
Wouah!!! You did buy the Murci!! You are a king! Cant wait to see the rebuild! Congrats
I just realised that I am lazy. There is no way I would have bought that lambo. Good luck Sir Matt!
Will you have to sell the Gallardo or vantage to fund this?
I think, Dear Matt, you have, indeed lost your mind this time. Well hopefully, you got this green junk, for the scrap metal price. I would certainly consider scrapping it, for example - who wants a v12 six speed, when there is an energy crisis? You gotta keeps the lights on BTW. Recently I saw a series by an expert mechanic restore one of these things 30,000 pounds just for the engine and gearbox, and the car had a mint body. The green machine stinks on the inside as you show us. And then you have the silliness to ask watches to contribute to fixing a planet killing car. Stick an electric motor in it, or dump this for scrap. I do enjoy your tenacity, but put it to good use. Not many people will care if you get to drive your boyhood fantasy. Take a trip to a retreat in say, Norway, and have a long hard look at what you are doing. BTW do you have a tattoo of this car on any part of your body, or just on a very small part, of your mind?  Most people who deal in the sharp end of these things, have equipment when taking apart a v12, or any engine for that matter, seems like you adopted for a chemical fueled apprenticeship, fixing up old broken shit, no one actually needs. You can do better than this, please put your efforts into the community, who have to breathe the foul air you wanna bletch out of a messed up v12.  Going to dislike the content of the video, and Unsubscribe.  Looking forward to more reflective video content. PEACE
this has to be a mistake but i hope u can do it
Well Mat, if you can rebuild that you can pretty well rebuild anything. I thought the Aston was a big job, but you’ve surpassed yourself with this nightmare.
How the captions system says "Murcielago" - Mercy Lago - Merchelago - Match Chicago - Murder - Merchelaga - Man should I go - Mercer logo
working on cars with your old man is so good. me and my dad solve so many problems together. cant wait to see how this one turns out. your're a brave man Mat. could turn out to be legendary.
U can easy afford it mat u tube gives u tube gives u $8000 dollars a week 🙄
What’s the bands name ?, I love that track
I’m so happy that you have bought this Lamborghini murcei , I really love your contant and I can not wait  to see what you going to do with this masterpiece 😊
The manual gearbox will save the car. That's the one everyone will want and pay for.
Man’s got more projects than Elon musk
Love builds like this. New subscriber right here
Good luck Matt 👍👍
Holy big balls!  Fair play - looking forward to watching this one come to life.  You got this.
Matt new motto like the sas who dares wins.
Not only is Everyman Racing a ‘shithole’, their engineering incompetence knows no bounds. Connected battery wrong way round ??? WTF !
Setup a go fund me page Matt, everybody donates £1 job done lol .....
Congrats! It will be awesome to see this car fixed.
Buckle up...this will be one hell of an adventure!. Pssstt c63.....
Well done matt your videos just keep getting better  all best with the car I'm sure the man to put this back on the road

Matt - Well done my son - Top Man
You are brave mate ! and only the brave wins !
Love it love it, rooting for you!👍👍❤❤
Keep ripping Matt!!
hi guy's. I am the mechanic that worked at every man racing that repaired the engine on this car.
Best car rebuild content on YT at the moment. Loving it! This car will take the channel to a whole other level and it is going to be epic to watch and come along on the journey. Keep it up buddy.
that place did seem so dodge having that many supercars/assets just gathering dust. not bothering to turn them in to cash or fix to make the most of seems highly suspect
Good luck mate you got a lot work to do mate
Please black it out, interior and exterior! 🔥
😎👌 give up the price man
Mat, your an inspiration. Your videos are entertaining, exciting and most of all i have learnt a lot from just watching you rebuild these cars. Your a legend!
U are definitely crazy! I am gonna like seeing this project
How’s your dads vw camper coming along
Mat you never do anything easy lol but glad you have the balls to try  can't wait for you to get into it properly bring on the rebuild.
Video and audio GREAT quality work!!!
Just ask for specialists to help you for free just because they want to help out & be on the channel ….
Hey Matt, check out PO Electronics Repair on youtube, he will likely be able to pix the cluster.... GL
All of the best with the project bro
Mat find Iain Tyrrell to help you.
Epic, absoutley epic
So excited for this!
Building that with the help of your dad is gonna make lots of irreplaceable memories to remember for the rest of your life cherish it.
Start of another great journey Mat ,tough job but i know you will smash it .Next 1M SUBSCRIBERS you deserve it all Mat.
300k views in 14hours🎉🎉🎉 fantastic choice Matt looking forward to this build
Big balls fella!!
Damnnn!!! A Merci 😍😍 This is gonna be epic mate
I used to own a manual 04 Murcielago and now have the Aventador. Brace yourself for parts prices as they are off (and I mean off) the scale!!!!! Good luck with your project, I'll be watching to see how you go.
That's definitely a dream car right there..
Should definitely do a LBW kit
Wow great find! also the fact that its a gated manual means it could be worth some huge ££££ once completed - cant have been too many manuals made in RHD
really looking forward to the end of this build !! what an effort :D kudos
This is my dream car 😍 (as I think for a lot of people) I can understand the risk involved with this but so glad you have taken that step to save a true icon of the car world. This is going to be a mega series! You mentioned about the price I think a lot of us would be interested in the purchase price of the car and the cost of the rebuild. Good luck with the rebuild can't wait to see what you do with this 👌🔥
What a project this will be I feel so sorry for your wallet cus man it’s going to take a bit of a beating 👀👀
man oh man matt has a huge pair of balls !!!! keep it green please !!!
형님 나는 한국 유튜버이긴한데 형님 너무 멋있어.. 난 다른직업이지만 형님 직업 존중해.. 나도 기술 배울껄.. 여튼 너무 잘보고있어요
Convert it to electric, problem solved
You're a brave man Mat! You'll sort it....Nice one.
Great showmanship ….
Oh this is gonna be an interesting one
Mat put a sv kit on it it will look nice.
This is so interesting can’t wait
"Next on the channel I bought this Death Star, just a bit of fire damage and some assembly required!"
i can tell this one is going to be a very intresting re build Mat, cant wait for the next video #big fan from ZIMBABWE !!!!!!!
This is the best car channel on YouTube I can stop watching 👌🏼. Congrats on the murci, and keep up the banging work mat 👌🏼
Ohh, I’m going to enjoy this
I would like this video many times if i could.
congrats and good luck with this car! Greetings from Romania!
Good work so far !!! Keep it up soon its on the road🏁👊
A car having had a sleep for 7 years. My goodness 😊
Nice one Mat, look forwards to following the journey with the car.  Am not a Lambo fan but love the colour of it
This is gonna be fun!!!!
Call Autotronics a call to fix the cluster
Instrument cluster looks like Master Chief
Mat so you did it again!!!!!!  I was expecting you to do the Rrrrrrrattle sound in the end :)
You are a mad man! 😂 ... You can do it though, good luck
Mat. Your a legend.
Absolute balls of steel Matt to take this on, can’t wait to see you turn it around as always and best of luck with it ✌️
Anyone know what the outro music is?
Mat, just when I think you can't push yourself or this channel further you go and do it! You should be happy knowing your living your best life and thanks for taking us along. Dream job!
Desperately trying to find some footage of this car from a previous Gumball 3000 rally based on the sticker in the driver side door
great work Mat
Best of luck m8
Im so addicted to his videos im always glued to my phone
Brilliant, my ultimate car, cant wait to see what you do to it
You are a brave man and its bloody excellent to watch. Cant wait to see how you get on with this. Good luck bro
In my dreams just like you a a young lad I wanted a lambo. Pretty sure ya gunna smash, and the vids will be epic and I’m sure there will be some carnage. My boys love it as much as I do. 🤙🐐🇮🇹
Best channel by far love the content
Time to call Tavarish
That Range Rover towing that Lambo! Perfect. Well done mate. 💪
Hi Mat, you have done it again!! this latest project will create the most viewers on any salvage repair channel. look forward to seeing the repair completed, which you will Mat.
Good luck on this matt, if you can keep this build under 150k then you've got yourself a real winner!
Just read some of the comments and it appears we all agree you are doing a fantastic job with your channel and you deserve every bit of your success 👏👏👏👏👏
Bro sell all the other cars to fix this mercy 🤣
We Love You Mat 🔥👏❤️ this is my dream car & I've never even seen it in real life 😥
Mat, that’s hardly even a car…. I have checked the dictionary and I don’t believe it actually qualifies… best of luck… you’re gonna need it…
Matt this is going to be such an exciting project, I can't wait for the next one already!
This is guna be another good one we'll in matt and your so lucky that hannah doesn't kill ya by now 🤣 but I think she just sits back and says OK!
Love your videos mate
So inspiring Mat keep it up!
Hey mat. Love the channel,  you mentioned about other footage of the new garage is on the other channel but I can't find one! Can you send me the details please. Garry
Is that the same as rob at salvage rebuilds has if is and you guys know each other at least if you are stuck on where something goes at least you can ask rob
This is like hitting an iceberg in the Titanic, but I hope this one ends better. Then maybe you can re-write the story? This is going to sound very angry, the loudest yet!
Looking forward to this one Matt
Amazing!!!!
I need that key chain 🤣
You will make this beauty shine again. ❤❤❤
Hi Mat! Im yours NEW subscriber :) SO EXCIDED to see this project!  I hope to contribute at least a little to the channel by following it!!! 💪 BEST REGARDS FROM SERBIA!
Wow its got a front numberplate.
Matt, check out a company called euro spares, based in Halstead in essex, they are a parts company for all super cars, speak to the owner, James Pumo. Good luck Steve.
Wow Mat you are a brave man, get ready to empty your piggy bank. 🙂
Thank you Mat...I'm not a big commenter but this is simply spectacular and sensational. What an accomplishment! I remember you working on the Audi S5 as well as the Bentley Continental GT on your drive at home. There's no one better suited to sorting out this unpolished gem of a Lamborghini Murcielago. So excited for you and Hannah and Liam and Chris and I just can't wait to see the progress you'll undoubtedly share with us. Best of luck team!!!
Can’t wait to see this series man !
Mat, Murcielago engines £28k on ebay, save your self the grief?
Matt, take the cluster to BBA reman...They are wizards at electronic dashboards.They sorted my Merc cluster  for a few hundred with lifetime guarantee.It worked perfectly for years.
At 0:21 a special red car is there. What the heck, they've got even an F1 car as well?!  Holy hell this car's gonna be an epic rebuild!
Matt just stepped it up!!!  Murci is the ultimate car ….  Amazing to see such a nice guy do so well.  Just love the videos, keep em coming mate.
Awesome dude buzzing for the next part 👍🏽
Keep it upp🚀🚀🚀
Sadly soon all combustion cars and trucks including classics will be banned from public streets in entire EU and Scandinavia  :-(  In Germany the Green Peoples Party gave order to shorten fuel supply from 2025  on by reducing all conventional fuel stations to only one state operated central gas station per city or county. Car washs will be forbidden too because they are climate killers, now they want to slow down all the gas station pumps from 20 litre per minute to 2 litre per minute...From 2027 on in the EU certain car spare parts will be banned too....as exhaust systems, turbo chargers and even some engine and gearbox oils...California and New York will do the same from 2027 on.... So no investments should be done in oil burning cars any longer....They even created a new kind of crime here, called emissions and smoke crime. (BABVVEN & TEBBVEN & BEFVO laws)!!!
Looking forward to it 😀
Love your honesty 👍
looks like the old mechanic sabotaged this one. You will do it Mat, good luck
Your pace is astonishing, I admire how you can see that these cars are repairable, great content.
One of my alltime favourite. Saw one at the Goodwood Festival when they first came out. Would not move till the owner  ame out and sarted it up. WoW. Unfortunately I read in a magazine later it crashed going up the hill!
You're just mad
Would love to know the history before Everyman racing, clearly been on the gumball rally, famous previous owner?
This channel is so underrated we love your content Matt
It's crazy that lambo is the best find out of all the cars u found and fixed up the history behind this car is unreal always loved the lambo murcielago
You need to do a gtr build or a supra ❤
Sheesh
I can’t wait to see this project finished. I would love to rebuild exotics, but my budget only allows me some lego technic rebuilds.
I initially thought ‘great another Lamborghini’ then you have got me invested just after this video! Great work mate keep up the pace!
Rrrrrrrr noise😂😂😂😂😂
Matt, take the engine to Ian Tyrrell. He does Harry’s garage lambo restorations
We have to thank the Audi TT for starting up amazing YouTubers such as Mat and Strad
I hope this gets wide bodied
How did u become a repair expert starting life from McDonald’s? Mcdonalds UK taught u how to fix cars?

Fair play Matt, look forward to seeing you and community putting the Lambo back together. 👍👍
Congrats mat for this big things, i enjoy your video 👍🏼
You just bought half Lamborghini! Eheh I wish you all the best with this one.
This is gonna need a widebody and a nice orange Wrap
Boring how about buying a crash damaged bugatti veyron super sport make it 3000bhp and go over 330mph like the hennesy venom f5
Brave man 😮good luck 😊😊😊
Is it twin turbo time?
I am SO excited about this one! Bring it on!
I would probably never buy a non runner, yet alone a car with no engine. On top comes unknown history, previous repairs etc .. But I do wish you well and can't wait for the results Mat 👍🍻🍻
If the car doctor can't do it no one can 😀
Buying that lambo wasnt just a bad financial decision but also a time waste, you will be pouring so much time into it.
Can’t wait for this one
This lambo series will be a good one
I didn’t know there was a 2nd channel…life just got that little bit better 😆👍
will never drive again
Always good when the bro uploads 🤘.... Its so awesome you got the murcielago it's my favorite lambo Well done bro... Always killing it
waste of money
Oh look. Another youtuber doing an audi murcielago. Meh.  Still, goodluck fixing that ugly grey/green piece of crap.
Congrats Mat! You are saving a Murci! Love all your videos!
Will follow the build!!
Well played Sir, well played! This is the next level yet again, looking forward to the Black board of cost to get this beauty back on the road 😆 if a replacement dash is 2.5k wow
Brilliant Matt, I defo had my doubts about the Murchi, but as u said that’s what u r all about, thinking outside the box. Looking forward to following this journey bro. Peace out dude.
This will be biblical if you pull this off 👌
Good luck. Cannot wait to see the end results. She’s going to be a keeper!!
Can’t wait to see this car reborn, it’s going to get crazy! This is going to be one hell of a ride! ✌️
well mate ... you have massive balls
This is gonna be mental Mat all the best buddy
I wish you the best of luck, I hope it all turn's out well.
Nice Choice, waiting for this Murcielago to be a MA Build. Grey Lambo ?
This is turning out to be a great channel for exotic rebuilds 🙏 hopefully Matt goes a long way
Woah le travail de fou 😮 Bon courage 💪
Love your have a go attitude Matt. Really looking forward to seeing the build of this classic Lamborghini.
Quality Mat - keep up the good work.
It seems to me that the mechanics at everyday racing are shit.!!!!……what’s happening with the C63.??🤷🤷🤷
Love it 👌🥰🚜
So excited to follow your progress on this one! Love your positive Go getter attitude. Top man 🙌🏻
Looking forward to this and seeing how you sort it out. Your optimistic approach is gr8
Dont care about the mechanical rebuild TBH …. Just tell us what colour you are going to wrap it !!  😂
Congrats Mat on living the dream! Who cares if this turns out to be a money pit, that's the beauty of it... just go with your gut and heart! Having this channel allows you to do just that, as you don't really need to be profitable from flipping cars.
Yes mate!!!! Love the Lambo
🔥🔥🔥
First off ….its LIME GREEN…….and……well…….uh……um……its lime green! What else could you possibly need….
Mat,  do you really love stress or do you just have a severe gambling addiction, lol.
Matt, love the choice! Gresley electronics in coalville are awswome with fixing electronics, really clever bunch their!
Hi Mat, What a car, best of luck with it. Will take some putting right, can’t wait for next blog and she will look stunning when repaired I am sure. Loving the channel.
Does anyone think Matt is hinting for you to buy him a coffee wearing his Cappachino Hoody?  He might need a bit of support for this build.
All this effort you deserve to be out there with 2 million plus subscribers   Great entertainment hard work put into all the cars keep grinding it’s coming soon the 1mill subs 🎉❤
The car is not secure and strapped correctly
You have determination
You can do it Matt.   We all have faith in you lad
Where is the bmw build
Matt you are brave man👍👍
Looking forward for this build :) Finally one car I will agree having it straight piped, that VEEEE TWELVE!!!!!
Push from the engine Bay 🤣🤣🤣
My dream 🤣🤣🤣❤️
There is a YouTuber called "thecoder" mainly repairs game consoles,  but I bet if you reached out he could repair the PCB of the clocks! Resistors blown still doesn't stop a surge to the rest of the board  Mosfats are probably cooked along with any capacitors.
Mad as a hatter when is comes to decision-making! Makes great viewing though! More power to your elbow Mat!
Doesn't matter if it's gonna be hard, atleast you have the car now ❤️
I'm literally crying of joy for you ❤️
Lol had to bring friends to hold you back 🤣🤣🤣
Omg omg omg 🤣 bro I'm going to create another 10 accounts just to like this video ❤️
Matt you did it 😐😍❤️
Omg omg omg omg 🤣🤣
Your Aston Martin video was the first I seen you and your wife or girlfriend and it sounded great and it looks badass hey man I think it's really cool how you're going to bring this back to life maybe you can get the yellow one next at a great deal. And keep on keepin on man 💪🏼💪🏼❤️🤟🏽🤟🏽
This guy is nuts....saying"Other than that, the car is in pretty good shape"
I love these projects Mat. Bentlley, Aston Martin Maz, Walk in the park👌
You should do a paid subscription part to your channel to help fund this. As a Brit it great to see a UK car rebuild channel doing it better than the Yanks.
Time just flies when I watch these vids, Mat. As always, love the content. Looking forward to the next one!!
Been watching for a while finally subscribed can't wait to see it running
Tacky lime green central!!! Why???
I have been watching mat for a while not like from day one but randomly scrolling through yt and more of from your Maserati build ... But I have to say mat is the only content creator in the car industry to do something experimental but make it work in a crazy way .... I hope this channel gets more recognition ❤ from India mat ❤
If your struggling, I sent my broken bmw electronic module to a place called BBA REMAN. They did a good job so I can recommend them.
You need to get friendly with Ian Tyrrell
Try YouTube channel My mate vince he likes a challenge when it comes to electronics
Like brother!!!
When Mat said: “We’ve got 500,000 of us…”, damn last I remember was Mat wanting to hit just 100k subs and now he’s making his way steadily to a mil. What a legend
Mat you can rebuild this car easily it's nothing just find the proper parts. and take help from a person who has been worked as a lambo engine installer in factory.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🗑️
lets go! u got my support
Absolutely crazy purchase, but you've impressed me already with that instrument cluster. I just hope you haven't been ripped off.
Where is the c63 bro
Soon 1.000.000 subscribers for sure!
Mad
i watched every videos from the S3 rebuilt, love from malaysia.
How can I contribute financially to help you Mat? Keep up the good work very entertaining 👍
Fucking Goooo onnnnnn lad. Honestly, you’ve worked for this. This is the next step now. Good luck.
Mat, you’re an absolute legend and inspiration. I wish I had the same positive energy as you. I’m in a dark place atm but I get just enough energy to watch your videos. Keep up the great work my man 💪🏼
I have to respect you for saving v12
Look for factory engine blue prints.
Man I drove by the unit the other day and thought surely he’s not bought the green one?! Should have known really 🤣 absolute madman!!
So Mat, you finally bought Shreks car? Wow
You are a brave man and I'm here to support you!
Rrrrrrrrrrrrrr 😂. Sick car man!
Good luck Matt 👍🏼
Glad you went with the green one. I think there will be times of frustration but in the end once you’ve got the engine back together and in the car and you’ve fixed up the interior and added the Mat Armstrong golden touch, it will make it so worth it. No matter how tough things get with this build just be thankful it’s not a Countach or a Diablo. 😁
kermit the frog disco elysium
Maybe swap the engine? You sell that engine you could definitely get a shitload towards a crazy build. I totally get wanting to keep it original but a swap would be really cool, maybe get more views. You could maybe hit up b is for build on how he did his 2 lambos on the LS side, but personally I'd love to see a 1uz as I think that would be the easiest way to get a high rpm, high pitched supercar sound out of a cheaper engine with the hp to show for it. Not to mention being a few 100 lbs lighter and definitely cheaper than an LS. Only thing is those adapter plates and ecu's can get expensive.
love your work Mat if i was in England i would help Australia is a big trip
I love your video u can do it matt
Fair play for going with the "interesting" option. This is generally what I end up doing myself when buying a new car, I'll look for something that has a few interesting problems, like timing belt that 'd due to be changed or a few warning lights on the dash. That way you get it for a lower price, you have something to mess around with, and you end up learning new things. But damn, this looks like it's going to be a challenge!  Good luck..
Something downstream of the 'resistors' has smoked them! Great project ! Wish you luck!
Jus put a 1000 hp LS motor in it with a Holly stand alone ,problem solved 👍😎😁
fingers crossed he fixes it
Amigo!! U GOT Big HUEVOS, Maannng, what a Project N just keep telling URself...Dreams DO come TRUE!!! We ALL here on this journey with U!!! cant wait WOOHOOO!!
Good luck lad
Mat know how to put it up every time 👌 But if he keeps saying MÜR-CHIE-Lago I SWARE TO GOD....
Please please please install an LP670 kit on this!!
Check out Daily Driven Exotics - the have a Murci that the body is wrecked .. but the driveline in mint ??
A wrecked Lamborghini would have been better to buy.
HUGE W for the channel
Great vid Mat. Obviously the car, but more importantly Kevin, Hannah and... your dad!?!?!?
3:01 This was going through my mind every time you've said murcielago since the last video lol
Lamborghini Mercy!
I've been following you for a while and seriously you are always doing videos so nicely, like the edits, the quality, the builds, yourself, all is just so perfect! Keep rocking Mat!
How do you stay so positive ? I hope it goes well buddy 🤞👏👏👏👏👏
CONGRATULATIONS MAT
This one is gonna turn out to be the hardest to date
This going to be an awsome rebuild
£0.50 per subscriber ........ This lambo would be purring, in no time .......😜🤣😂
Come on mate you can do it, this is going to be easy!!!! ✌😎 Cheering you from Mexico 👏👏👏👏👏
LS swap and twin turbo. Good luck with this one man.
Green looks way better than Yellow 🥰
You're a brave man! found your channel recently... love your energy! *subscribed! :D
Mat has the best content in his category, buying cars, turned it into a business, profitable and able to enjoy what he does. Classical bro I hope this is around for a while
This is definitely the most anticipated series!
Matt I hope you get your own TV series
This rebuild every dream car I wanted 😊
Where’s the aventador video
tavarish did a rebuild  on his fast and furious merci u can do it too
this poor lambo looks like jeffrey epsteins victims
#Matt buying the green Merci is a great investment, when all the hard work is done (there'll be lots of that) it will be worth it, fantastic score, may the build begin. 🎉  🤙
I hope you finish this car, make some serious profit elsewhere and go back and get the yellow one 😉🏆👍🏽
Less go another series! Me excited
Am I only just realising the murcielago has focus mk1 side repeaters? 😂
Good luck with the build. I have a 04 murci in verde Ithaca. They are great cars and green is the best color on it (might be biased😊)
You’re mad bro!! Actually it looks awesome and can’t wait to see where this ends up!! Def ditch the green interior tho - go back to black or gray.
I think if you say gated manual in relation to a Murci any more times, it'll summon Ed Bolian
Freddy Tavarish May be able to help you because if he was in over his head with his Mercy Build you may have just Buried yourself but I love it and I believe in the process u can get it Done
The step motors fail often on these too but those resistors / diodes definitely look to be the culprit.  If you need a hand with the repair I’m an electronics engineer in Leicester
Is the Yellow one still for sale…??
Hi how much was it Matt.😁
No way are you fixing that proper. If it was an easy enough fix that would be in a proper lambo restorers garage. That will bankrupt you that.
Any bidy here from algeria or just me 😅
You are rock
3:05 mercy! Nice!
Congratulations and thanks for deciding to buy because I actually basically begged you to do the build 👌🏼😁I'll be watching every episode as usual
Mat, you nutter!!!
Mat. This content is next level. You know you can do this!
Mat in 3 years time - I just bought the UKs cheapest airbus A380. Can I repair it?
Not gonna share with your viewers what you paid for it then????😜
where is the c63
I have a picture of me driving this car when I went to everyman racing about 8-9 years ago...
Mat if you had bought a old Ford Focus i might have been able to help you but your on your own fella🤔
Already stressing about the build 😂😂😂
Hoovie Garage
You can do it
Please keep it stock
honestly inspires me to just grind out my passion for a year, which this upcoming month will begin. Starts are always the struggle, but I know theres greatness ahead.
The cars keep getting better and better. Just putting it out there it’s always been my dream to go in one of these 😅
Epic as per usual Mat. The cluster should be fixable.
This will be finished before Stradmans Gallardo 😂
Hi Mat, put a fueltech in this car.
Best of luck Matt, you're a great guy and I'm really enjoying watching your channel grow!
Amazing
Crazy how a car like this can end up in such condition but if anyone can rescue it, Mat can
Great content! Love all videos 👏🏼
Excellent channel, love what you do 👌
Congratulations Matt! Looking forward to this build
Ill watch every second of that rebuild ! Good luck Mat
As part of this collective do I get to take me bird out in it on Sunday?🤔
Is he buying an Audi
Was I the only one hoping that Mat would buy the green one ! 😊 keep up the great work guys 👍
Big ⚽️ ⚽️ taking that on
Hi mat was a lad in YouTube who repaired clusters did my ford oddball one when I was unable to get a replacement . Think I  search ford focus cluster repair . Had similar issues .
God luck Mat👍. I love your attitude, a real car gay😃😃
Fuckin nuts!
Actually I like the green,,,be a byatch to keep clean!
Rocking it for Notts.  Well done Matt
Dad to the rescue again ❤. Looking forward to the first drive.
That interior 🤮
The is a awesome project.  The best projects are the ones nobody wants.
Lad, how do you stay so positive. Bold choice, but you know what? You will do it. Great attitude and honesty. Best of luck, I think you might need it on this one.
Mat, is not "Mercylogo", its MURCIELAGO 🤣
It looks class. I'd love the wrap to be peeled off at the end & it rewrapped green or resprayed green would be even better but costly of course.
Another risky and great build and after the Aston Martin, no one can ever doubt your abilities and we know this one will be moving soon😂❤🔥🔥
You should hook up with "My Mate Vince" and ask him to take a look at the instrument board.
Can’t wait to hear it start 🔥🔥
This video is awesome
Im dying to know what you paid for it.
What a legend… this is going to be an epic build
These ain't aging well looking very dated
The car is totally fine if you got it for less than 100k. You have to get the engine out anyway if you are serious about fixing these cars. The chassis would be probably rusted and it needs to be fixed. Back of this car is just a few pipes so it needs to be checked and fixed. If you have engine already out there is no reason to pass it.
I remember finding Matts channel in High School and watching him build an S5. I just graduated College a couple months ago and oh how far he’s come.
Fair play mat. You might be lucky but you work hard and you deserve it. I'm sure you will enjoy it even more working on it. Congrats 🍾
where is the c63 ?
Nice Lambogreeni mate!
Yay! A Kevin sighting!
Can't wait to see it in the road soon🔥
ah quality stuff your old dad you cant buy experience they called my own father China in Arnold Clark I asked why his names Kevin they said he can fix anything like Edd China lol i have used BBA reman for instrument cluster repair on land rovers  also used them for a Chrysler and was superb hope you get that thing sorted I can't believe they left that like that  for the love of cars if i was a technician there I think I would have had to somehow buy that and fix it some animals been at it doesn't matter if it's a Lambo or a reliant there built with nuts and bolts and lots of plastic lol  you will get it sorted just like the rest no sweat
Wow I am so exited to watch every video with this build the Murcialago is my #1 dream car all time !! Can’t wait!!!🔥🔥🔥🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
LET'S GOOOO HE BOUGHT IT!!!
This is gonna be good for me stick another better engine in it
This could be your best build ever Matt.
Living the dream 🟢 definitely the best rebuild on YouTube fact!!
Hi Mat, As it's an 02 reg. How do fancy...WH0 2 REV... as a reg number for it?
Mat i think you need another blackboard to write down your list of cars and ongoing products because even I've lost count and I've watched all your videos 😆
Get a go fund me page asking for a £2 donation Mat....you'll pull in the pennies to get this back mint in no time.
you are the man
never mind mat Armstrong it should be mad Armstrong but we'll be behind you mat
Should’ve bought the yellow one mat!!! Congratulations two lambo garage 🐎
Hell yeah you did buy one . Your balls are massive an your bank is even bigger . I am positive you are gonna build a killer car an learn so much that you might from now on just build Merci's . How many others are even trying to do this ... The channel is gonna explode I can feel it.
Bring your dad on more videos
Matt you havent lost the plot. Trust me you got this bro!! I cant wait for this series.
At the beginning I thought you were just another idiot trying to be a YouTuber. How wrong was I!!!!!! Absolutely love what you do. Top class content. I'm here till the bitter end as far as your channel goes. Wish ye all the luck in the world.
Best of luck Mat.
Tavarish can help you get that thing back together haha
Should of went with yellow 🟡🟡🟡 just put a 2j in it.
resto mod the car. Motec dash motec ecu etc...
Getting stuck in mat thats what we like to see 👀 🙌 👌
You should collab with Officially Gassed 😎
Man the steering wheel looks like a Evo 8 steering wheel
Respect this will be good
We all just know this build is going to be epic.
just tell us how much it was you narnce
Hello Matt, you might be able to send the dash Circuit board to a specialist repair who repairs and tests automotive electronics for a fraction of the cost you should get warranty on the repair too, Hope this helps and keep up the good work.
Good one Mat!! We’re all around to help :)
🔥🔥🔥👏👏👏
Drop an LS crate motor in. Then you can have more power and modern electronics.
BBA Rahman, could probably fix them clocks Matt boy. I used them a few years ago
One step at a time, and you will get there, it’s impossible not to, especially with your enthusiasm, your dream car in front of you, and your supporters behind you.  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
You know it’s getting serious when dads get roped in.
This is so awesome!!!!!
Wen Lambo?
I start watching this chanel as the cars was affordable but at this stage all the cars can’t relate to uk car owners
murci not murshi...
Cracking project great buy
This rebuild will be MONUMENTAL!!!! My fingers are definitely crossed for you on this one. Just watch those subscriber numbers fly up after each Murcielago episode 🙌
Send the engine to Iain Tyrrell for a full rebuild £££ but it will be bullet proof then.
Mat is a glutton for punishment - this one looks by far the most difficult. Good luck fella!!
Mat, one question. Have you ever had a project car that failed that we don't know about?
You will have to send that engine out to get rebuilt or do what they do in American and put an LS motor in it.
Like I said on the previous video, you have made the best choice this is the ideal option for the Chanel also to challenge your skills and make it more fun while you are building it, well done 👏
As if I go to that van auction nearly everyday that is on the same sight as that and I didn’t even know 😮😢
This is why your channel is absolutely amazing, grinding away 24/7 and making banger videos always
This is going to be a marvellous build
Your sir are a bloody legend always a pleasure to watch cant wait to see this beast fire up so dam cool . 😎👌
Absolutely love this channel. Keep up the brilliant builds and contents.
To say you own one is massive , It's gonna be one hell of a project but you will do it . Just think of the grin when you get to drive it.
Wow this channel makes such good build content. Love the editing, b roll, commentary, etc.   Very knowledgeable guy!
Love it man, dreams coming true and we get to enjoy it with you. You made it so far cause of your personality, you and hannah are a great bunch. So much positivity
The sheer excitement and determination you are with every video doing something you love for a living has us all back every time, amazing work from you all
Another great build coming :D Can't wait, good luck m8 🔥👍
Here we go again😂
Just wanted to say congratulations on another fantastic video.  I am delighted to see you have your Dad helping you. Hope you Dad appears on the channel in the future. I lost my Dad exactly a year ago. I have lots of memories of him and I working on cars.   Keep doing what you're doing Mat. 😎.
A rip off gypp
Lets Goooooooo Mat! Subscribed you got this!
You have balls the size of space hoppers.  Love your content.    You are a brave man.
Its like you're building cars from old NFS games 😂 someone say SLR after this? 👀
I like Hanna
Your the best car channel on YouTube
there's me thinking the porshe project was full on,this is next level. looking forward to this going to be great content 👌
Am I the only one to see the gumball 3000 sticker on the door seal?
Are you going to make this electric? :-)
im gettin so much inspiration watching these videos while im on my own project. obviously i have no money so its taking forever but its surely got me pumped up and on the case to get the job done seeing how happy your projects make you once done. Peace!
Can’t wait to watch this build! Loving your work!
Why green over the yellow?
It’s crazy how you went from modifying Hannah’s black 1 series on your driveway to now!! Can’t even remember how many cars you own now 🤣🤣 such an inspiration tho! 💪
I’m gonna upset some ppl but I gotta say it I’m an English lad who moved over to the states I was a die hard tj hunt fan mate you are slowly taking that spot on my favourite automotive content providers you are crushing it mate please keep taking risks! We love it. Right imma get off ya Willy now 😂
Lookin 4ward to the next instalments of this car
This is gonna be one hell of a build...definitely biggest yet. Can't wait to see this 🙌
Well done Mat!!!  I love watching your videos and  really looking forward to watching this project develop. You deserve all the praise you get for making them and the success you've had due to being so entertaining and humble!
Put a turbo Honda motor in it
Mega! Just mega
Buys murcie when there’s an aventador in the back ground?
Car Wizard. *laughing * Good luck mate..
You have some insane projects going on right now, i especially love the series for the new Lambo, the Porsche and the 6-series! You are amazing matt
Good luck 🤞
Matt you have a serious problem. WreckedCarItis. Thankfully for us!  As it makes great watching.   Keep it coming.
Absolute legend have been watching mat since he bought the Audi TT. Top fav YouTuber 🥳❤️

When she says “is that it” 😂
So glad you got one Mat, you would have spent the rest of forever kicking yourself had you missed the opportunity, this is gonna be an epic rebuild
You really need to get someone involved who really knows how to rebuild performance engines because if you make mistakes on that engine it could easily destroy itself and cost a fortune to sort out. That said this is going to be a seriously good project, from a content point of view you picked the right car, this is going to be an epic rebuild.
Good luck with that one fella
What a legend u are mate, glad you went for the green Lambo will be a cracking project 😁
Sick man! Excited for this build
Mat, do you have a support PayPal account ?  If some of the supporters chip in a bit you will be able to get this one back on the road. That engine rebuild is going to be expensive…
Money pit. I can't wait 👍👍👍
Of all the cars that Matt has restored, this is the one that is worth it to go all in!
2jz swap
Matt mate, amazing car. You're looking a bit tired. Make sure to take care of yourself and get enough rest.
There’s a good few company’s in the area that can repair boards. With the small components like that it’s best to let someone with a bench and correct rated tools (heat wise) attempt it. Don’t use a company in Tamworth.
Now I understand why you were hanging out with Tavarish.
Change the interior. First job
Is that a Gumball3000 sticker? Was it in the cannonball event?
Legend 🤜🏻🤛🏻
So look forward to this one. 👍👍👍👍👍
I've never liked a video so fast
THE LAST GREAT SUPER  CAR❤❤❤❤  I bet your buzzing mate? Big up 👍🏼
Excited for the build
Buckle up people (if there’s even seatbelts) we are in for a hell of a ride with this one!! Can’t wait
The side indicators look the same as focus mk1s…
Keep going Mat 💪 your on a winner ... 🏆
I know a couple of tech guys that repair circuit boards act for cars ,
Sell your other lambo and use the money to rebuild this lambo
Next year: I have bought a abandoned Bugatti Veyron cheap!
looking forward to this build Mat
Everyman have had you over
Brave
Matt have complete faith in you,just take your time like always and this will turn out as good as all the others. Good Luck Brother!!!
I'm so ready for this series 👌🏻👌🏻
Please just don’t keep in green!!
I love how this is one of the only channels that actively includes music on the videos... What a difference it makes!
Matt is a whizzkid
I've only been watching for a couple of weeks and I have really enjoyed it I'm now a subscriber. Quality show 👍
Stoked for this build!
Well done Matt, you didn't disappoint  love the way you let us  see you going broke slowly, real top notch Matt . Take picture of yourself and compare it in a few months with no sleep and a your new tent
Awesome, you bought the green one, looking forward to this one... Best of luck.
everyman racing mechanics aint got a scooby
i hope you can do this  if you can its a nice save !
This is a crazy chanel and your crazy bro ❤❤🎉
Congratulations Mat, what an awesome piece of automotive history
Going to be great content but I think this one will be an absolute money pit !
Fearless and optimistic!
Massive balls
Mat this is insanely exciting! You're killing it mate, you're changing the game, keeping it fresh, this is so deserved 👏🏻  can't wait to see it finished
Is the yellow MERCI still for sale??! I know a guy named Damon looking for one! 😂
So I'm in Birmingham (Solihull) on business, watched this having dinner  in hotel. Then realised i had no toothpaste, walked to local Morrisons and look up to notice Wheel Mania right there, as made famous through following yourself haha. Small world
So excited for this!!!
I played a drinking game with how many times you said MerSHialago 🤣🤣
We’ll be waiting for that RS6 C7 build 🤤🤌🏽
We need an update on the BMW!!!
Cant wait for this build to start 🏁🚗
Two add breaks in the first 11 minutes, it’s worse that watching TV 😠
Game changing move for the channel Mat. Keep being curious, keep pushing yourself, keep exploring and the content will just follow.
I just found your page from the Lamborghini video I’ll be here till she’s done it’ll be worth the wait!
Wow, like the Porsche really can’t see this one comeing together but I have faith you’ll get their in the end
Bravo sir, will follow with interest!
Just stopped the vid after watching the Merch on  the trailer…. GOOD MAN !!!!!    Peace Out !!!
stressing me out thinkin were do you start
Looking forward to this build.. how about Walter Wolff colours ?
On the plus side, think of all the room for activities where that engine would normally go! 👍🏻👍🏻  Cracking stuff as always Mat, legendary! 👌🏻
Looking forward to this one 👌
We are gonna be here watching 100%
The man has big kahoonas
Lambo Murcialago, MA is now truly ballin’ This is a huge project and I’m gonna love watching every minute of it.
Yes Matt can't wait to follow along. This is the first time I've seen your dad involved, does he help with many of the builds?
Mat has finally gone green. Why did the previous owners strip a green car and then wrap it green. Madness, glad you picked green Mat. It was the right choice.
Superb video. But any update on the Porsche?
well i'm pretty sure you can handle it just nice
How much was the yellow one?
Next year this time around Mat will be rebuilding a Bugatti 🇳🇦
Big job on your hands there mate but I’m sure you’ll smash it!!
Since I started watching you I've gone from not believing you to been more excited than you. Fuck yes.
Who's is the fabia vrs?
I cannot wait for this one!!!!!
This is, by far, my favourite YouTube channel. I get disappointed when I log on and there isn’t another video. 🤣
Ls swap it. Jk
This is insane. Shoot for the stars mate! You are killing it
Any progress with the bmw 7 series? No updates for a while
This is going to be awesome Matt & Hannah 🚒👍👍
Gutted. I was hoping this vid was from a year ago so I could binge watch the whole process.
Matt - congrats - I would love to see you DRY ICE this beast when you put it back together - get it back to mint factory condition - no wrap 😉
Wish i could jump into the future and binge watch this build series!
Good luck Matt
She seem to be a good car 🤣Men you buy a parts car ?
Should hit up Tavarish or Ed Bolian for help they may even have parts
Only been watching your channel a month but love the work you do. So glad I can see you fix one of my favourite cars. Good luck!
Looking forward to this rebuild. Keep the content up. Mega Money Pit. 💰
And thankfully the world invented interior retrimming companies :)
good luck mate will watch with interest
How much was it though?!
Top man, have you told them you will be back for the yellow one in a couple weeks. Great to see you and Hannah working with your Dad. You guys will smash this, can’t wait for the next video. 👍
Mat, how do we buy from them😂 i want one
Mat go buy a Lamborghini computer ASAP, that's the only computer that can talk to that car and help you calibrate and make sure everything is working on that car
You've pooled a Tavarich 😀
Brilliant car man good luck
Get onto Phil Morrison at Driftworks his Murci resto GT1 conversion is 🤩. Ricky at RE performance who snailed your Gallardo an absolute guru on Lambo’s or Ratarossa must have decent  connections…even a collab…..
How much was it ??
Need to have a chat with Phil from Driftworks about his murcielago, maybe get some help or pointers
love your videos matt
Great call.  Excited to see the next videos and final product, nothing too challenging for you my man, you got it! Good luck
There is no denying that there is a massive wealth of knowledge in the comments but can I just say you know its a good video when Mat's Dad and Kevin are in it!?!
Nice Project. I wish you all the best for that 😍🔥👏
Awesome stuff..followed this channel from the audi tt and now this..Great job
Man how cool is this good job mat . You have big b*lls my friend man i have so much respect for you can't wait to see the upcoming series of this car ( and i hope longer videos of it 😁) and good choice on the green 👌😁
Matt not gonna lie found your channel about 6 months ago and an watched every build litrally binge watched it for days on end and can honestly say mate your smashing it I love your channel mate and your energy so good to see someone doing what they love!🙌 keep it up mate!🖤
Lets goooooooooooooooooo
Really curious now as to how much it actually cost?
It looks absolutely shite, but I'm sure ur over the moon with that purchase and I would be too if I bought one even in that state. Enjoy every second of it!
If anyone can, mat can
Am i imagining it or did someone really put Ford Focus side indicators on the front wings 🤔
Legend defo inspired gonna put a m5 exuast on my 530i cant wait till it comes 🔥💪🏽
Real excited to see the progress of this one! The end result wilf def be worth all the time taken making this beauty run again👍🔥🔥
The best explainer and the best vlogging content about fixing cars Is Mat Big W to mat and his team
So glad i found this yt channel. Cant wait to see the progress
Time to start up an onlyfans mate
Dream Car dream build, make the videos longer Broseph!!
Pretty Merci, Cleetus McFarland got his hands on one that was swapped with an American LS engine, mostly bc the original V12 went boom, and the previous owner decided not to spend 3/4 the price of the entire car on it's powerplant.
Great build! Dry ice blasting will knock the years of grime off.
Chain sounds part was the best😂
🎉 so glad you pulled the trigger! This is truly amazing content. My favourite build so far is still the Bentley but this is next level 😎
Let’s gooo
Before you ask, satin black. Murdered out !!!
Mat fantastic build good luck 👍you got this,
Wow u want  charity for your silly desires and passion
So happy for you. Please use leather fat on the interior to make sure the leather relaxes.
The best bar none, car channel on the planet. Well done 📈
Let’s do it Mat!! Cannot wait! Loving the appearance of senior Armstrong!! #fakegreenmachine
Good luck mate - wish you all the best with this Italian beauty 😊
Awesome this is game changing Mat
Everman Racing looks to have no oversight as to what their employees do. Imagine being paid to work on cars and your cross jump a lamborghini
Congrats on the new build I’m excited for this one
Nice over Hoovie, Mat is the new geezer on the block! Nice mate, I’m looking forward to your next Porsche vid! 👏🏼👏🏼👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
I love supercars mate! You keep up the good work man. I love your vids.
What exactly is that place ???
LOVE THE VIDEO TEAM 👍👍NO IDEA ABOUT THE MECHANICS BUD ❤❤BUT CAN GIVE THE CAR A GOOD CLEAN 🧽 👍🧽
Mat you're mad, let's ride though
Looking forward to the content on this one, as a qualified mechanic I wouldn't of got involved lol  You're clearly built different  Hope works out for you and creates life changing content
insaneeeeee go on mate
I was rooting for the yellow one but this will be such a sick restoration, I can't wait good shit brother keep killing it
Love how much of a risk this is.. when will you tell us what you paid ?? Imagine being your age and owning 2 lambos a Porsche a c63 a Range Rover a gt86 and a masarati
🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰 @Matt trust I rate you bruv you need a big heart to do this not everyone can pull this off. Call it the Hulk. V12 content not for the faint hearted weak youtubers. Respect
Fair play Mat.  Another great challenge of a project.
If you get stuck with the Murci you could ask Tavarish for a few pointers as he has just unveiled his new second project Murci from Fast and Furious with a jag engine currently so you are both in the same boat but opposite sides of the  pond. Great project for you though Mat I can’t wait to see you get stuck into it
If it was anyone else but Mat Armstrong, buying that car would have been the wrong decision. Instead, this rebuild is gong to be a magnificent project to watch. If it ends up anything like the Aston Martin, you will have an absolute winner in your hands.
Here we go again 😁😁😁😁😁😁 this crazy man will take us to another journey... love it
We will be calling you Mr Green😂❤
I'm seeing the six series in the background. I so want to see more of this car
Levels Mat
At least you dont have to change the dashboard 🤷‍♂️😂😂
16:00 - You're Welcome
Hope it works out Matt :)
I want to hear this thing start up!!
Good luck with the resto Mat! Is a twin turbo conversion in the budget seeing as you have the engine out already? 😆
Nice one mat this is awesome! Stoked to come along for the ride!
you 100% got this
Legend! Keep up the great videos 👍🏻
You mad man, 😂🤣, I'm gripped by this crazy stuff. Best of luck 👍🏻  Love your channels
Omfgggggggomfggggg you did it
I think you should known as big balls Matt good luck with this one can’t wait to see the end result
I can't wait to see the build such an iconic car. Let's see matt work his magic
What a car! This content is gonna be epic! Go on Matt
New subscriber here. Love the content. Sent here from Life Of Palos.
I know you lost your mind , but knowing Mat , will find it
Can't wait to see this rebuild 👍
Can’t wait to follow progress Mat !!! Top  Man for taking a punt on that Lambo 🙏
Go on mate! Your gonna learn so much on this one. We all will! When do normal guys like us get to see the soul of cars like that and get to work on them. Your doing it for all of us pal 👍
Resistors we can replace
If you need a help with the motor them please let us know!
Have a word with Simon George (he's on Pistonheads) who ran SG54 LAM which is currently on 250k+. Has a lot of knowledge and contacts in the Murci world.
My god Matt you’ve got a set of granite bollocks on you, fair play can’t wait to see how this build goes!!!! 👍👍👍
Amazing
Worst thing about being this early is having to wait for the next upload!
Very brave taking this on. I really hope you get out of this one, your skills are incredible
Just watching the video makes me panic and anxious. I would never take that job, you're crazy 🤣🤣
gulp
Yesss! Get in! 💪
I’m absolutely stoked you’re going for this it’s going to be mental. You need to do continuity checks across that clocks board, anything that is open circuit will be a burnt out component, and easy to fix
I wish it was possible for u to release all parts at once like a netflix series 😂
Another brilliant project whatever you do make sure you change the colour 🤪😂
Cannot wait for the next video on this one!!
im buzzing for this project
Oil starvation from a failed oil pump leading to no pressure on the chain guides ans who knows what other damage.  No such thing as a cheap Lamborghini.
Yes Matt! This is going to be epic built and cannot wait to see it come together. It is also nice to see the Dad in the videos! From TT to Murcielaro...
Pushing the envelope with this one Matt !!!
F##k top gear, this is where its at....you keep it real
No reward without risk 👏 cracking content
Time to fly Tavarash over!
this will be insane !!
Hey Matt,  Victor here, from Southern Californian. Came across your channel and love watching you rebuild all these cars. Can’t wait ti see you transform this Merci into a beast. Cheers
As always the Genius on a mission.  Love you Mat
BMW...other channel Mat?
Loving your content and have shared with friends with common interest in cars. Good luck with the build looking forward to the next video
You got this matt 💪 can't wait for more videos on progress
Can’t wait for this one 🎉
Check Daniel Rakowiecki channel. He fixing electronics for living from laptops to factory control modules.  For sure he will be able to help
Mat in 2023 - "I just bought a wrecked Bugatti Veyron"
When Son bites of more than he can chew - call in Dad :) - Gonna be an epic journey getting this back on the road, but I'm sure you can do it!
Nahhh you made the right choice out of the 2. Will blow the channel to the stratosphere this one. Been here since the good old TT days and seen the full journey. This needs to go that lambo yellow like the other one though when it’s done!!!!!!
Love the content Mat good luck with this one. Loved Range and Vantage projects
The tenses you speak in are insane!  “The Murcielago is came from….”  Absolutely baffling 😂😂
You Sir,  are absolutely chuffin mental!
Can we fast forward 3 months please Mat?
Loving it. Awesome content Matt! 👏
Good luck mat, looking forward to this build, I have fauth 😄
Can't you create a way to just donate a little money for the ones that want do something like that to support you in doing this.
Ooooh Matt actually bought it 😁😁😁
Before the vids gets going all I can say is good man, you made the right choice.
Make it into a living room entertainment center.
Love your content. Absolutely love the cars you rebuild. ALL of them. Your finishing touches really add to the cars. Only "gripe", please clean the cars inside and out before you work on them. They will look so much better especially the engine bay of this one.
Bugatti will be next Matt, keep up the great content
man i'm so hyped for this project
Great car however i was sad not to see the 6 series in there.  ☹️
Some how keep going bigger and better you really do keep us all hooked, got my fingers crossed it’s a good build for you and you get it back on the road and back to its former glory which we would all love to see
Matt if u want to get rid of the stink check ammo NYC he has thing where  you get rid of the stink
Well you've  gone and done it again  matt !!!! ,  Looks like  you have bitter off more than you can chew !!!! But we said that with the Aston!! . So jolly good luck , will look forward to seeing this  one ...  !
Good luck bud
Fantastic!  Start a crowd fundraiser page 😂
Great to see you working with your old man , another great video btw
been watching you from the audi TT , loved all the vids mate
Looks a ropey this one Matt old boy but i know you’ll smash it lad. Best of luck!
This is going to be epic! Good choice! 👌
"Not been in an accident".  Well, never been subjected to an insurance claim. I'm sure it's been in a few "scrapes" in it's career due to the nature of the business you bought it from. BUT, I have every confidence in your ability to get this car back to showroom condition Matt and I look for ward to seeing it being transformed.
Luv ya stuff mate, cant wait to see your journey with now another project. Wanna see more on the 635i if poss 💪🏼👊🏼
oh love this , you are smashing it every time now , fantastic, cant wait for the next video
You are different.
Unfortunately, I can only like - I am already subscribed 🙂 Keep on going! Like!
love watching but you have probably a very good income to fund this and some people watching think they are gonna stumble upon a bargain that will just miraculosly be easy to fix! nothing but headaches stress and hassle 🙈🙈 if its in pieces or written off its because financially this made sense 🤷‍♂️
Tell you what mat you’ve got some balls
Good luck with this one Mat - I think us viewers will get many hours of viewing pleasure from this purchase of yours!
You crazy crazy person! :)
I'll probably get shot down in flames for this, but that engine looks like it's been an engine for too long.    The solution would make interesting  content, and be a new departure for Matt.  Fit Tesla motor and batteries!  Gearbox and engine is probably FUBAR,  the instrument cluster needs to be modified anyway.  Matt can still work his magic on wheels  styling etc.  It would be on the road before Elon Musks roadster!  Obvious to me!
Soon as you showed us the green car I had a feeling it would be your choice. It will make for some next level viewing.  Good luck with the project! P.S. where did you get the floor tiles you used in the old unit, they looked like they were really robust?
Iain Tyrell for advice on getting her going.
Professional seat sniffer.
YES MAT!!
When’s the next video 😆😂
Good luck with the car Mat. No doubt you'll get it running again.
Looking forward to this one I'm a trained mechanic never done anything with lambo befor but have done a few ferrari's   cannot wait to see that engine sorted and singing again if I can help in any way drop me a message
killin it Mat!!!
U crazy
Rrrrrrrrrr noice 😂
One of the last honest you tubers I wait to watch, keep it up
Contents unreal as per usual👌you gonna sell or giveaway some cars before you run outta space😅?
Check out Tavarish’s lambo
Hi Mat can u put a link to ur other channel please
Great Jigsaw puzzle.
Good luck Mat !!! I hope you will get it back on the road buddy
You make it look easy, Matt. Hopefully will be a success like the Aston. Good luck
This guy is a credit to the car scene 🎉
Brave
What's going on with the C63 Mat
Start a go fund me and I will put a few quid in, your content is top shelf!
Hope u get it going
Yes!!! I have been waiting for this!  Thank you Matt.. it's going to be expensive but this build is going to be your best yet 👌
Im sure you can do it mat
Cool content. Glad you chose this one
Not looking good, Matt, I hope those clocks are from the other car that was jumped backwards, as if it was that one you may find that every module and ECUs are fried, fingers crossed its not the case, if it is throw it back at them, as they said o ly an engine issue, d
Oh dear. He is doing a tavarish
What a legend!
Engine chain gets tensioned by pressure of oli pump, which is connected to the chain tensioner. While oil pump is pumping oil thrue the engine, it creates pressure.  I hope i helped and good luck with build!
You are too good man
Boss. If you can pull this off, this puts you on a different level
Go on mat, congrats
Really jealous of your repairing skills and all the cars you rebuild, they are epic, keep up these builds can’t wait to see the next video! 🎉
Mat I love the content keep doing the good work buddy 🤙🏼.When's the next vid on the old BMW coming out?
Think you may be the only youtuber that could revive this car. i am excited to see how this goes.
I know electronics in general but don't work on cars. But still if there are some damaged & expensive electrical parts like this clock module and there are some burnt up electronic components on some circuit board let me know I might be able to fix it. I'm extremely good at soldering, down to components size of a grain of fine salt, those resistors in mini-melf package should be piece of a cake, though I may need picture of those resistors on undamaged one because those are burnt up enough for me not to be able to read those coloured strips which tell the resistance value (unless there are some schematics which say what value are those).
Wow 😳 good luck with that one.
Love watching your videos can't wait to see you get started on this car mate u deserve your dream car mate hard work does pay off
yay, the green one 😁😁😁😁😁😁
Watching this all i had is my two year old son screaming green! If Arthur loves it it’s going to be an awesome adventure!!!!
Defo put some type r seats in there
Hi Mat, big Congrats! My youth poster car was lamborghini countach and Vector W12. Sow i can easily relate to your Murcielago "crusch"  ;-) Was thinking, now that you are restoring cars, like M539, wouldn't a vaporblaster be a super solution to restore most metal parts?   Keep on the good job.. Beside the Murcie, the Bmw CSI is great content..
Top man
Please change the interior colour
This is going to be awesome. So glad I come across your channel. Love watching your videos there grate.👍🏻
We knew it would be the green one!
I might have chosen the yellow one which had fewer problems...lol. depends on the price..
Teaching while learning is a proper skill
F yes mat, my stomach sank when I read  that 😂😂 Have hoped you would choose the Lamborghini 🤙🏼
Oh my god! I am buzzing every build just gets better, Mat amazing as per usual 👍
Cant wait to see the end result of this build
Hi Matt when you get it all built you should get a  Exhaust and a flame tune from alex gintani 👍👍
The Hulk would love that car. Lol
Yee mad man
prob a voltage regulator blown next to those resistors bud also maybe a buggered diode or 2 there too might be worth seeing if  the guys u got the car from have another dash thaT WORKS SO U CAN GET PICS OF THE COMPONENTS ETC FOR THE VALUES AND STUFF TOO REPLACE
Call him nuts but he's doing big things. Ride on pal.
So 😎
Unreal 👌🏽
...it is meant to be the LEPRECHAUN!
This is gonna take some TIME. Can't wait to see this series! Epic project!
You’re a brave man Matt! But without your mad purchases we wouldn’t have anything decent to watch. Looking forward to seeing what you do with this one.
Thanx for the AWESOME content!!! Watching & supporting from SOUTH-AFRICA 🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦
Keep it up pal. Looking forward to this build.
💚💚👍👍
Love seeing KEVIN!!!!
I believe you are wrong when you say this is the biggest project yet. The 635 BMW is going to be far harder and more involved than this. This is mechanical. The bmw will be every aspect. Sure, this won't be 'simples' but a breeze compared to a full resto of a rusto..
Hi great video... Can I ask what price they asked for each of the cars  Cheers
I love this guy 😭❤️❤️❤️🔥
Congratulations from the bottom of my heart Matt.. I totally understand, this lambo is my only favorite lambo of all since i was a nind.  Best regards from dear switzerland 🇨🇭
oh my! epic times ahead
Tavarish better check his DM's
Are you ginger?
Good luck with the green machine Mat, rooting for you mate
I love the new project …….however…………..get a spanish lesson ………and learn how to pronounce MURCIELAGO …….IT WIILL INCREASE YOUR STREET CRED ! 😂
Guys I have an idea. I guess you should make this car electric. I know   battery packages can be quite expensive but it is going to be a fun project and you guys can sell it for a good price with a little of detailing. I think  no one can imagine quiet Lamborghini.  Gas price is rocketing but electricity is cheaper and you can charge your car with solar panel if have.
I love his work ethic and his drive to wanna work on vehicles he knows nothing about
I want to See the old BMW rebuild
These vids are just getting better and better. Smashing it Mat!!!
good look Matt,you will do it as always.brilliant channel
You have one of the best and most enjoyable channels around. Congrats on the new project and stay humble 👍👏
So sick Matt... We've all got your back on this one!!!
Holy sh1t Mat! What the f.... well this is going to fun!
Only you can make THIS RUN again. LoL
Yes you done it 😆 my dream car to don’t rush this one may take your some time to get her on the road  will be watching 👍
Thumbs up for Mats dad👍👍👍
Yes
congrats 🍾 I thought you wouldn't do it but a deal is a deal. Subscribed
I'd rather a Bar room beating then attempt this car's comeback! I just subscribe to follow your progress...good luck 🤞 ole boy !
Crazy man, this is going to be some project!
I so can’t wait for this !!!
Good luck bro,as always we know you’re gonna kill this project as well 🔥
‘Has came from this car’?!   Is this guy for real. He cannot even speak his own language!!!
Good luck with your new project 😎👌🚀
Simply insane!
Balls the size of melons taking on this project. My 8 yr old and myself look forward to a Monday evening and the latest video…❤
I think this is where your luck runs out! Money pit walk away now 🤣
For me the rear is my favourite view love those light clusters
V10 not V12
I hope I can lose the plot like you one day lmao
I’m stoked you picked the green Lambo I know you got what it takes to make it roar again!
Time you asked for volunteer support subs for this mate ,a quid each will soon mount up , so long as it's voluntary there will be no come backs
Matt if you can't get the engine running properly you could always  convert it to tesla electric motor and batteries rear front and behind the front seats bud ¯\_(ツ)_/¯♥
You absolute legend Mat 👍🤘
Taking the channel to new levels 1 car at a time 🔥🔥🔥 makes me happy to see you so giddy over this car. You and Hannah Keep up the great work 💪🏻
it's a like from me. this is going to be an awesome project can't wait to see how this ends.
Come on! Get the next video up!!
I only found your channel because I was looking for a TT when you were fixing yours. Normally I would have moved on but your genuine nature and attitude made me keep watching all the other projects you've done and I'm glad I've been able to watch both you and your channel grow. Keep up the amazing work. We all know you will nail this.
wow massive  gamble definitely know your the man for this is be amazing once back on the road . but matt how much did you pay for the beast. Good luck can't wait to see the next video.
Great automotive adventure, and with some YouTube cash helping, you can take insane jumps into the unknown like this. Lamborghini parts proces are pretty insane, and the v12s are way worse tha  the v10s, so I am sure there will be plenty  of wincing from all from time to time. But also some great saves...like a row of resistors for a couple of quid that could well repair a 3.5k dash... Brilliant content,  enjoying this so much, fascinating seeing cars like this worked on, and how ingenuity,  expertise, knowledge and hacks can bring a supercar back to life, when taking it to the main dealer would cost  you hundreds of thousands in parts alone
8:50 min - somebody may have gumballed it. 🤔👌
Really looking forward to this , you’ve got balls of steel mat, good luck matey , 👍👍
Bloody love this channel mate
I think you’re mad, or brave. Certainly will be a wicked build to follow. I wonder if the parts will be cheaper than the Aston… Here’s to the next vid. Good luck.
Good luck with the build,Mat. Brave man! A dream car of mine too, especially in that colour. 👌
2jz
Getting more extreme after the Porsche! At least it's already in a great colour
That lambo looks sick just sitting there it will very satisfying after you complete that built
Mat, a bit of advice on the clock repair. Take it to a micro electronics repair shop and not a normal auto electrician. Soldering onto these boards is a little bit different to the normal process due to the temperatures and proximity to other components.
I love your humor and when your being funny it makes the videos 1000X better. Much love 👌🏼❤️
Awesome! Great chanel! Really looking forward to this build 🤜🏻🤛🏻
You have a big set of balls Mat! Hope it goes well for you!
So fucking excited for this one 🔥
well done,fantastic project,you will definately come out on top.great project
I have heard about somebody in London that can repair your speedometer bored
Props to your girlfriend, the best supporter you will ever have, and a good dman camera girl
Where the BMW build??
Good luck with this one Mat - no pain, no gain 🙂
This will be the best project ever built on youtube! Good and strategic purchase🔥
This is a lot more of a worthy cause than that twat Ratarossa literally asking for donations to help him buy a million quid F40
whats happened with the 6 series, you Cleary had no idea what your doing with it
Just when I think you can’t get anything worse……🫣😂 I’m sure you’ll crack it! Not enough Kevin in this video😕
You bought it! YEESSS!! 😁😁😁👌
I figured you were going to get the one in the worse condition, I think it will make for a better video series… can’t wait for the journey, and to see the finished Lamborghini !!!
Mad as a box of frogs.  It’s been thrashed up and down their track, when I went the Lambo’s were burning oil!
You are properly mental Mat 😵‍💫🥴 Can’t wait to see where this journey goes! 🤘🏻🇦🇺
You could try the trading buisness model, where you rebuild cars and trad it for more expensive ones...
love wat matt dose got your bk 100%
Ladies and Gentlemen Matt Armstrong does it again !!!! I believe he can pull this ....one lots of love mate  all the way from Zim🇿🇼🇿🇼🇿🇼🇿🇼
Mat so pleased you brought it, Lambos are my dream car too, but as it looks now you've just got to remember it's an empty canvas for your art to rebuild and make it better but keep it stock as to hold its value for you and Hanna. now get to work on it and get some vids out.
you can fix it good luck 💪
I done few of those engines back at the time, they are quite easy tho, just strip it down completely and start from zero hoping the liners are ok
Back following Matt and literally can't wait for this.
So u selling Aston to fund this ?
Congratulations Matt. I can already visual the finish project, as you have the ability to do it. Keep the hard work cheers
There are some content creators you stop watching after a time, but with Mat that time will never come I reckon. I've watched you since the crashed TT.
great job been watching for awhile and think your really brave taking these on . REALLY BRAVE. just thought i might put a wee mention in to maybe restoring a toyota corolla ae86 sometime if you can find one abandoned 😅😅
I love the green color 🟢 😊
LOL ! I thought you was going to ask us to donate to a go fund me for a second 🤣😂 Youve got this Mat looking forward to the journey. All the best
You had the right car dude 🤘🏼  good luck  What a vehicle I can hear de-cat  vid coming !! It will never go down in value when it runs 👍
I'm strapped in and so ready for this journey.... handbrake off Mat and let's all go!!
Such a refreshing change to the usual boring boring stuff dealt out by the usual crowd , excellent content and channel 👍
I surprised you can walk carrying around those huge pair of testies  taking on such a car that the slightest fault or problem can lead to huge costs. I’m hoping and praying this beast gives you an easy ISH ride
Mat, you really do make hard work for yourself, this to me is a scrapper... To you though it's a challenge for us watching it's an event and great viewing. Keep it up
I have never experienced split personality quite like I have watching this video.  One side of me: Its a neon green lambo, with a non-German derived V12 that is next to it rather than in it. Madman!  Other side: You legend you have your dream car and it’s a proper manual with a proper Lambo (heritage) V12!  Will watch with interest.
So glad Ive found this channel and watch the start of this epic build.
when that is built drive it to monaco again
Looking forward to this one!
This is a mega project but the content on this will 🚀 serious bit of car to restore but, in mat we trust to get it done 😜👊🏽👊🏽
MURCIÉ LEGO
It's better you do this rebuild rather then some other youtuber
Absolute balls of steel!!
lambo money pit fair play to ya got some onions
if it was to easy it would be no fun to watch. looking forward to seeing this come together. 😀
Excellent! This is gonna be good!
Crash damaged supra ??
Wow 😱 what a project. Only you can pull this one off Matt.
Matt i know you love building cars however i enjoyed the time when you did not take on to many projects at one. Iol i love to see you finish the projects you already have going on.
Who’s guessing Mat has put down a “holding deposit” on the 2nd Lambo........ 😉😬👍
Mat be like : Decepticons Assemble....
Good luck keep grinding my friend it will be worth it in the end ....
I love you so much
Gutted I couldn't find you at Petrolheadonism, but this is going to be epic!
They say there is a fine line between genius and madness. At this moment in time I think your mad 🤣🤣🤣
With such big balls I’m not sure how you even fit in that car 😂
Matt you need to be committed to a nut house.Your perseverance is outstanding, & good luck on completion of this beautiful car,minus the colour of it😉🤣A wrap is truly needed on this one,& i would go for the green wrap you did on your  vw golf.Its a better class of green.
Mat you got BIG ⚽️ ⚽️
We are gonna need a picture for that Jigsaw. Looking forward tot his build. All the best with it Mat.
Matt not many people are lucky enough to be able to buy their dream car. It's and inspiration to others how You have come from zero and built your way up and worked your backside off. You absolutely deserve it and more. So enjoy every bit of it.. Can't wait to see it finished!
Thank you for buying the lambo
looking forward to all the episodes for this one!  episode 443 not the usual 8 part :)
inspiration 🔥🔥 if only you could find a B7 RS4 for rebuild 😎
You're an absolute nutter!!! Congratulation this is gonna be a good project 😃
This is great.  Believe in you!!
Huge fan can wait to see what the lambo project it going to be😁
I think the biggest problem was the interior,  If someone pukes in there, you wont be able to see it. Hideous . 🤮 Massive challenge, but not the slightest doubt it will turn out just fine. 👍
For the first time ever, you actually made me happy and proud. This was the best financial and career biased decision you could have possibly taken. Congratulations Mat
We rebould a **Burned lamborghini gallardo** on our channel. So i wish you all the luck for sourcing the missing parts,.   So i will follow this build closely🤞🚀
Needed the money pit key ring. Add to basket 😂
You are insane ! …
Happy you bought it. Hopefully it's not going to kill ya rebuilding it. Looking forward to watching the transformation.
Awesome, I’m sure there was one just like this at kennelworth race track In Warwickshire, I drove a red Ferrari and it passed us like we weren’t moving… if it’s the same one, it’s a monster lol
I feel like you are realy trying to find you limits. Wish you best of luck, will def watch the proces
I think you should let go the porche and focus on the lambo because its soooooo expsensive to repair god damn
Hello Matt & Dad 👋..Firstly Congratulationson your New Purchase or should I say ,New Exciting Adventure ! I'm really looking forward to your future videos on this Epic Sports Car ! But I know and you know ! You will transport this vehicle into the Stratosphere!!! So let's all encourage and inspire you to Forge Ahead !!!!!!😉😉😉😉😉
This channel is amazing... It sucks that the work takes a while to complete. I wanna binge these lol
Sick ✌🦊
Send that cluster to MyMateVince! What a colab that would be
Good luck Mat, Looking forward to the next video. How is the Merc coming along?
Come to Šabac (Serbia)!  If we don't have a Lamborghini, we will get it in 24 hours, assembled in parts, in  Sir Oliver price (Alan Ford , for younger )🙃
Sick vid bro
Let's just all agree when mat posts a new video it just makes our day go better.
Told you in the last video, stay away from Everyman Racing, worst experience company out there. They wont have told you half the truth. But you're invested now so good luck with it and I honestly hope it works out for you.
Matts next project “I’ve just bought a crash damaged challenger 2 tank off the British army” 😂
Should of gone to spec savers😂😂😂
Looking good Mat. Need to change that colour and interior tho..
Yes he only gone a bought it didn't he yea yea
Where is that bmw????
Love itttt 🤩🤩
I think now you can call definitely call cars your addiction ;]
Cannot wait to see it on the road!
Great purchase Mat, look forward to seeing this in person 👍
Great car but a lot of work! No doubt that you’ll get it up and running though Mat. Looking forward to the future content. Terrific to see your channel’s success
💗💗💗🤘
after a shit day a new Mat Armstrong video is bloody fantastic!!
This car is just a beast, amazing. Wishing you all the best going forward with it.
Can no wait for this one it going to be so sick when it all done by far the best car YouTube out there and how far you have come is amazing keep up the good work mate
Keep up the good work
A Lambo Murcielago Nice one Matt!! Your all ways challenging yourself and that’s what makes great content!! Can’t wait to see it back on the road Matt Armstrong style🕺🕺👊🏻👍🏻👌🏻
You had to get the yellow one
I recon he payed around 50k for it, Mat you should get a smashed defender or old discovery to fix up, countless upgrades and modifications available, you can also off-road it 👀😁
Good luck Mat, Seriously interested to see how the this build unfolds !!
Awesome project, looking forward to the videos! Can you describe what the smell inside it is like? 🤣
Well done Matt ! No doubt it will be awesome once you have completed the rebuild. .Get in contact with Phil he has a wide body V12 and might be able to help you with electronic faults and stuff . He has a YouTube channel.  Best of luck 👍🤘
Brilliant!!! I cant believe how much enthusiasm you have. Ive watched all of your playlists and absolutely love them. Can’t wait to see this one. Thanks for your channel 👍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
JHEEEEE ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ask  ' StezStix fix ' the famous youtuber to fix the circuit board
Cartroniks in Waterlooville near Portsmouth will 100% be able to fix that instrument cluster as that’s all they deal with everyday.
Like most MA supporters, I've watched since the TT video right through, up to the very recent (for us) Aston  which has been my personal favourite. This one though.... this feels majorly different even though the car is older than the Aston. This is a step up AGAIN in terms of level of courage required. This one feels like a genuinely risky decision that could prove to be a winner or a loser. You Sir, repeatably and reliably, set new standards of content and I think its astonishingly good.
Now once finished with it, that will be a proper flex. That's going to open doors to a lot of opportunities.
More please 👍👍
Do you think, there may be a chance that the mechanic who worked on  the Murcielago, may have intentionally sabotaged it. As its seems strange that he quit soon afterwards!.
25  pence off everyone of your subs would give you £125,000,of course you could sell a couple of your cars so you could get that engine rebuilt,you will not be able to do it,you need special tools,you should get the gearbox done as well.
Great job!
Nottingham massive here mate...yeah boi
Nice purchase, you'll have lots of fun with it but first the hard part, rebuilding it. Could you ask some advice to Tavarish he rebuilded I think the most famous of murcies the FF8 one. Eager to see this rebuild. Oh and please wash it first ^^
Have you thought about a go fund me? To help with the build?😀
Mad disrespect for the company treating a car like that, never mind a Lamborghini! Do what you do best Mat! ❤
Mat….you are the king….I know you do this……good luck….I am watching from Amsterdam
Well done mate! it’s an achievement just buying one, Be interesting to see why that engine is tight, your a born struggler 😂
What is your outro tune? I love it 😀
Can't wait for you to rebuild an aeroplane on the channel.
where is the c63
Pure motivation brother,love your work
Good luck Mat , we have faith haha
Loving the dog! 😆🤘🏼
Green grows on you
what about the e24
Love from Ireland 🇮🇪 ❤ ♥ 💖 💕 💗 🇮🇪💚
Can't wait for the Journey ahead mat 👌😀🙌 and love you'r content 😃
carvertical report: no mileage fraud, not stolen, no damage, NO ENGINE :D
Oooo this will be a big one.... forget the aston dash , that motor will keep you busy and give us lots to see 🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🍺👍
Nah Man U get the thing u want the most the right way it give u sense of validation that u achieve your dreams and now the sky is the limit u just got to dream bigger and better
Best car rebuilding channel on youtube hands down !! Well done Matt
Congratulations matt been watching you now for a long long time you can sort out get In there lad👍
U2 have the biggest balls on the internet boyo glad u and Hannah got the green ish one
Just when you think your channel couldn't get any better.....You buy this bad boy 👏👏 Have to admit though Matt, my first thoughts were.....He's mad 🤣🤣
Another video on this lamborghini as soon as possible please matt
Living my dream pal ever want to employ someone 😉🤣
Great to see your Dad..
Love it class guy
sounds like they sold some parts
Is the Lambo version of ratarossa? I'm sure there a few things that might be cheaper then expected thanks to VAG.
you need some PCB's checked or some micro soldering done hit us up!
565k subscribers I reckon you’ll hit a mill before the end of the year
Would have been nice to see the yellow one instead but that's just my opinion.
Wow Mat this is going to be interesting to say the least.That would scare most people to death so fair play.Bring it on!!
Engine swap time..lol
See you in florence when the car is finisced😜
keep up the good work❤️
Wow wow and wow! 💥
Be positive Mat everything would be done step by step. I can't wait for the v12 sound.
Whiffy stench is probably due to mildewy leather interior. Whip it all out and let it air. Then get it all treated.
👍👍👍
1 million subs inbound
Fu*king brilliant channel well better than half the crap on telly
Would really love to see a small 500 for once but this project is super cool🎉🎉
Why did he go with the green one????
Wow love your enthusiasm, whatever you do don't try to turn the engine over, you need to strip it and at least get the heads off before any rotation, I'm sure you know that, good luck with it, she's a pretty big job!
Keep winning Mat! I bloody love this channel and all the rebuilds are so inspiring.
This is going to be some journey best of luck Matt 🤞
Wonder how much more the yellow one was ? Was hoping Matt had got the yellow one. But now this should be more exciting to watch as it’s a going to be harder and more challenging.
Can you hook me up with whom at Everyman racing is selling the yellow murci. i'd like to save it and get it back on the road.
ledge!
Looking forward to this build, would love you to strap a turbo or 2 to that V12 & go mad, I'd paint it black aswell with carbon bits everywhere, wheels redone in Shadow chrome 😉 cheers Matt ✌🏼❤️
It’s hard to explain but when you see a super car that needs work but is attainable you just have to buy it. I missed out on a Maserati Merak a few years ago and I didn’t buy it and I still regret it, the car was rust free but had engine issues so I get why you bought it and I am looking forward to the rebuild. Thanks Tom
Simply awesome 👏🏻🖤
This is going to be insane
👀 K20 it 😂😂
Cant get enough of this channel. Keep it up mate cant wait for the next episode
I can't wait for this one. I think they would have told you anything to get you to buy it. No one leaves a car like that just sitting around. They knew what they was doing. Do the car justice man.
First build the porch and after than build the Lamborghini's
You need your bumps feeling, but it will turn out good as usual.
There's surely a company to replace those resistors. Like there is channels detected to repairing playstation, Xbox, PCs etc, maybe they can assist. It's just a circuit board at the end of the day.
Omfg yes
Yes Mat! Can’t wait to see this one progress. Infact I can already see you & Hannah on the road to Monte Carlo to finally take that casino down 😉🙌
Love the content 👌
Matt what’s that chain noise !!!! Trrrrr
Dude!  What have you done?!  Haha  But seriously, I bet you'll figure it out.  Good luck!
The interior is awful.  Pleaseeeee dye it.  Looks like they’ve done a MA and wrapped over a repair instead of re-spray.  😀
Fair play to you for having the balls to buy that car. Ive rebuilt all sorts of damaged/ mechanical/ story vehicles all of my life. Im 60 now so no spring chicken. Take my hat off to you on this one, i wouldn`t of had the courage to buy it. Fortune favours the brave as the saying goes.
You are a silly plonker & a nutter.  I think Tavarish had a worse lambo but it's a toss up due to other factors.  Good luck on the build.
Mat, nice project this Lambo!! What's happens on with de C63?
Oh yes, ball deep in the lambo. Great choice of car. Even if you don’t use the original wheels, definitely get them properly refurbished, originality with these cars keeps the value up.
Glad you chose the green one pal ,, loads more content vids to come from it 👍👍.
So happy for you Matt. Absolutely love the content
Everyman Racing? Prestwolds? I think so.....
Keep at it Matt!!!! You WILL do it.
You should watch Tavarish’s video series on when he rebuilt his marcielago
Got some balls you lad lol Take my hat off to you 👍
Good luck 🚗🚙🚘👍👍👍👍👍⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Thanks Matt :)
I hope this works out for you. You deserve this .
Firstly l have to admire your enthusiasm Matt and the things you’ve done thus far is staggering your attention to detail is astonishing, however l am now wondering whether you’ve made the right choice of Lambo, granted the green one was cheaper to buy but l can’t help thinking looking at the boxes of parts and the problems that you know of as yet this could work out a lot more expensive than the price of yellow one. I hope l’m wrong but either way l’ll be watching every step of your journey with this car, the only thing left to say is good luck Matt your going to need it.
You’re a brave man !
Finally you bought the Lamborghini of no fix 4 7 years
This is going to be mental... With you all the way Matt, Hannah and Kevin 🤪🤪🤪🚗🐶 will watch all the way.  I think after this lambo the only thing to top it would be a complete overhaul of an American Aircraft Carrier.......
'Good Luck' on this one Mat!!! Keep her lit
Love watching your video makes me wanner pick up a spanner and I work on cars everyday
Mat, you made one of the best decisions in your life, it’s a keeper!
Nothing better than Mat buying a car that we all agreee on 💪💪💪💪
Best purchase you've done so far, car wise at least. a manual Murci, can't beat that, hoping it'll be restored "professionally".
Gated manual, 'nuff said.
Unbelievable task ahead….. Good luck👍
Big balls. Good luck to you....
Good luck bro
You might as well buy the yellow one, then you'll be able to see where everything goes on the green one 😉
Mat LAMBO Strong
Fair play Mat! From a content point of view, its going to be brilliant. However... You're still nuts! 🤣
It's just a VAG but you picked a gated model. Wish are rarer and hope  you can't get a list of lost parts from everyman racing. To make a full car, as it looks like they should have lots of spare parts. Stored some where. Hope that circuit board can be fixed, then buying all new parts.
🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿
Wonder what he paid for it?
One of my all time favourite cars,congrats on your new adventure,I'm pretty sure you that not only have you got my support but you will have many many others supporting you,you really do deserve more subs,people don't know what they're missing. Anyways I'll keep watching as always and you will be driving that Lambo down Stelvio Pass like you did with the Aston which by the way I'm very jealous,gorgeous car. Keep going and don't give up we've all got your back 🤙
WHAT DID YOU PAY?
Hooolyyy! I didn’t think you’d actually take the risk to buy this one! That truly has to be the craziest choice on this channel so far. 🤯 As always - I’m keeping my fingers crossed and can’t wait until this gated crazy italian v12 will come back alive. Good luck on that!
Man!!!!! Hats off to you bro, like living the dream, taking risks and making them Work, credit it you!!!
I love your channel  bro watching from south Africa
👍🏻yes  looking forward to many videos on this 👏🏻😊
You crazy man
Mat I have no doubt in the world that you will have this looking and sounding amazing.  Before long the biggest decision will be what colour to wrap this bad boy in.   All the best with this man. And love the look of the new unit looks amazing 😊
We believe in you
I think the People at everyman saw u coming a mile away mate and wanted to book a holiday hahah
and there's me thinking the content couldnt get any better, thiss i going to brillant👍😀
Hello
You remind me of my teenage self buying cars people say I shouldn't but some how making them decent and profitable something I'd love to do again
Best off the best 😃🔥💪 TOP PROJECT BRO  FROM 🇵🇹
Well one thing for sure, your definitely not shy of a challenge. You'll be booting Phill out before long and taking over all the units.
You absolute madlad. This will be an epic rebuild, and loads of cool content comming our way. Best of luck!
Oh it really looks like it's just the resistors that have been blown. I mean if you cut the wire to your phone it wont charge so you buy a new and it charges again. There is a real reason for it to not work because of only the resistors.
Excellent, thanks
How much did it cost how much did they want for yellow 1 damm u got a fucking beast of a lambo bro can't wait to see you work on this bad boy love LE3
Gonna be epic expensive build but ur well up for it. Brill episodes
Hannah, Any chance you can keep him under control? The guy is absolutely crazy!
Another brilliant video fella can’t wait for the next instalment of this one… hopefully we will see it in Monaco 👍🏻
You should drop a 2jz on it
You’re definitely courageous. Looking forward the resurrection of this beauty.
RRRRRRRRRRRRR !!!!! :) LOVE IT
I FOOKING LOVE THIS ❤  GET IT BROTHER GET IT!! 👑
Everyman racing dont treat cars very well. Car looks a wreck but if anyone can sort it Mat can.
13:30 why u didnt try starting it up? Fuel pump was priming.... ;)
V12 twin turbo is what I see in the future. The Green god will be rolling before you know it 👍 can’t wait 🤛
Literally can’t wait to see future episodes on this build!
You inspire me Mat. Work ethic is mental.
What was the price of the car?
Each build just gets more unbelievable! If anyone can Matt can 🚗☁️💥
I’d say you got a good car there mate, gonna be mad profit if decided to sell in the end.
Bro where is bmw video
This will be a cool build can’t wait … crack on Matt
I cannot wait to see this build. You’ve got big balls Matt. Best of luck! If you need it crowdfunding I’ll be happy to chip in a few quid
Could u do a bodykit on it such as a SV?
This content gets better and better
U absolut Monster!
Just like you I would have gone with the green one. Well done. I have a mate George who owns The master locksmith in Palmer's green north London and he is a genius when it comes to pcd repairs
Resident cynic here - Ive gottta question your logic - 500k subscribers isnt gonna pay for this, am I feeling a patreon buildup :) Anyhoo, you said yourself you took someone to keep you level, yet you still bought it knowing that some muppet cant tell the difference between + and - on a battery. You also said that you paid on the condition everything was complete - which it isnt! So basically Everyman Racing have pulled your pants down. Still its a lovely car and I hope that it doesnt bankrupt you like so many other car repair channels :)
Awesome car can't wait for the next video keep up the good work 👍
Mat, love your content. I aspire to have the drive and energy you do to bring these beauties back to life!
Love the Green 🔥
Wicked mate. Got to ditch the green though! Has to be yellow or black imo.
Mat is the goat of rebuilds , from start to finish his channel gets better and better , should have his own show one day !
This will be an amazing build!  Daily vlog? Do it do it do it do it
I remember when you had 20k subs and a driveway for work ,done very well and may it continue ,well done young man
Dreams can come true mat.But this could be a long sleep to fit all this in to one hell of a dream.Go for it
Matt,you have not lost the plot with this one…..it’s a LAMBORGHINI……🇬🇧
Its a clapped out old track car the track made enough money off of and parked it, had a gated Murcie..was ok not a dream car for sure and mine wasnt clapped out
Should we start a MA go fund me page for this lambo.. 🫣
So glad you bought the green one. I know you'll have it running tip top and looking super fly. Can't wait to see the next video.
Already waiting for the next episode
Fantastic car. Really looking forward to watching this one 👍
Keep going Matt you will get there in the end
Any update on the C63?
Can't wait to see how this goes Matt.
Mat wondering if you could try help me as im looking for some power steering pipes for a 58 plate astra project and cant seem to find the correct ones they have screw in ends just looking for some advice were to try as none on ebay looked for hours , cheers keep up the great videos and you have inspired me to take on this project thank you bud 👍
Would love to come help out on this project great content keep it up man
Fantastic putting it back to the original perlescent Green would be sick. Yep you can defo get the clock fixed for a lot cheaper than £2.5k and keep its originality 😁👌 can't wait to see this epic rebuild starting to take shape. What I like most about your channel Matt is you don't just start something get half way through and give up you put your all into getting it finished and done 💪
Good luck with this one where can I donate ?
Mat you know what I really love about your builds? That you go all out and you aren't afraid of putting new steering wheels on your cars and that you actually upgrade the interior when you work on them. I feel a lot of other builders ignore that part of the car.
I have to drop whatever I’m doing and watch as soon as Mat uploads another video! Wish they were twice the length to be honest and I don’t say that about ANY video on YouTube!
Brave Personally, I am not a fan of lambos but looking forward to the journey that looks like a nightmare
entertaining and bloody brave you folks  🤘😎🤘🇬🇧
Nice to see Kevin
You are amazing Matt best channel on you tube been with you from day one thank you
Mentalist 😂
Have been following you from the start Matt.. I’m proud as hell for you foreal your gonna be a billionaire one day.
Don't know if it's just me but would love longer video mate but I know treat them mean keeping them keen ha ha
Anyone else notice the Gumball 3000 sticker?
Nice car mate , love how your not afraid to get stuck into anything
Definitely reach out t tavarish or VinWiki for help or questions!
That should keep you out of mischief 😁👍
This is going to be exiting 😬😁👍
Well done! You’ll smash it !
TGE had his car repainted for £50,000. 🤦‍♂️. Good luck.
Mercy-o-lago!😂
Congratulations! Can't wait to see you rebuild it! You'll have a very rare and desirable vehicle when you're done with it though.
2mins in the video, and I'm like 🤯
Great. Wish I could help financially,but I can't, sadly. Hopefully others can. The only thing I could do is subscribe to your channel.
Well worth it when it's done engine might just been rebuilt just make sure change belt or timing chain service it put engine back in
Hi Mat. Looking forward to seeing you complete this build.  Hope we can meet up for a Pint in the New Year when you complete the Build. Keep the Faith Brother.  Greetings from Trinidad 🇹🇹
Fun fact(s) that maybe you already knew:  *"Murciélago"* was a Toro Bravo (Bos Taurus Primigenius) that was pardoned for its bravery in 1879.   All names of the Lamborghinis are names of Bulls (Toros de Lidia)that The company used in honour of Ferruccio Lamborghini for the love of Bull Fights (corridas de toros) that he had.  I guess I'll suffer greatly for the anticipation of each episode of this build Matt. 😅
Can't wait to see how this build goes! You've got this!
Best of luck Matt really looking forward to this build going to be epic like all your builds are
Such a G
Should have got the RS6, it’s too much for you to even handle
Wow this is some project 🔥🔥 we have all got your back mate. I don't know fuck all about lambos but I'm here if you need me 😂😂😂
Everyman racing are well known for racing there cars with the  check engine lights on  good luck
The yellow one was way more better….🤔
I can’t wait for this one, need to get on this full time from now 🔥🔥🔥
An Audi RS engine would fit in there too, could make an interesting hybrid! But I’d want to keep it original
No job is too big for mr Armstrong, if one Armstrong can make it to the moon then you sir can rebuild this weapon of a car🔥🔥
I can't wait to get started with the Lambo
Your name should be nurve strong instead of Armstrong
be quicker Mat - need to watch the next episode haha - fantastic - gonna be the best one yet!!!!
This one is going to be epic 👍
armsrong mk2
Good luck Matt with the raging bull. It is going to be awesome when finished!!!!!!
put the porsche engine in it
Great project. Definately on my bucket-list :-)
Hay Mat  Jumped in the deep end with this one, the car i lust over.......did i just say that, any way happy building, the journey just begun, Take care.
Can’t wait to see the build for this 😊
Great purchase Matt, excited to sink into this series
In matty we trust 🇬🇧👍
I just have no idea how you do it Mat! I really struggle to get a video out every couple of weeks on my channel. So impressive how hard you graft and the time you put in to create content.  I was a touch disappointed when I saw it was the green one as I loved the yellow, but after listening to the whole narrative you've made exactly the right decision!  As always best of luck on this build. Not that you will need it of course lol.
Fair play Mat.... good job you’ve got a brilliant girl friend!!!
Wow !!
Love your content Mat eachtime I wish the videos were longer, I can watch them all day
Man get a small crew to hand you out for help and editing and filming guy like two of them keep showering these contents cause we are crying with these delays😭 start them with avg wages and gradually increase their salary your channel has popped so muchhh like i can’t explain matt been watching you for months now and not having it with the patience❤ much support from india
Class mate
At this rate, this guy will surprise us with a Bugatti
Mat stressing over the car,  Whether it'll even start or not. Here I am thinking what color combination mat should select 🤣.  We trust in Mat.
Watching the complete back catalogue while keeping up with new content. Excellent channel. Hannah deserves a G Wagon 😂
Mat i dont want your vids to end. Theyre ace and also proper emotional with the classical bits and the cars looking sorry for themselves. Keep it up. Love the descriptions and talking us through the bad and good bits before you work on it. The insights. The camera footage is ace too!!❤
Epic car Matt! This really will be a mammoth of a challenge!! However i do believe step by step you will get there with it!  Can’t wait for future content!! Your garage is gonna be unbelievable!!!!
Come to the auction next to Everyman racing one day,we can show you some more cars for you to buy 👍😂
This is literally the best channel on YT atm! Keep it up 👍
How much u pay
Me who just noticed that the number plate says 2002 (MM02) and it's a 2002 model, brilliant!
I reckon I’ve seen this car in wymswold good luck with this one Mat dream car
🤣🤣 the random Kevin shot had me in stitches
Looking forward to seeing you work your magic on the Lambo. I reckon you'll crack on pretty quick with this build. Once audi took over the engineering improved 100 times over. That V12 is an all time classic engine. Good luck Matt
How many cars can you build at once Matt some boy 🙌🏻
Good luck! Might be worth speaking to Phil @Driftworks. Best of luck, looking forward to seeing this progress. 🎉
You are one hell of a ballsy geezer!!! Smashed it 👏 🙌
Thats never going to run again
We belive in you, you'll manage to do that enormous amount of work 😂😂👏👏
StezStix Fix? Is a UK YouTuber who fixes electronics. He may be able to help with the fried cluster.
Lambo ❤
Can’t wait to buy a ticket for this motor
Did DDE channel not have same issue with engine
Fingers crossed about the engine and gearbox. Mate you have a big pair to take this one on.....all the best🇬🇧👊
we need an sv kit on this
Bro we are waiting the next episode dont be late 😂 love you ❤️
Jo Lamborghini is actually owned by the volkswagen company so you will find many parts out of German cars!
This has Tavarish collaboration all over it
Really hope u keep it that colour
looking forward to the updates
Ahhh you got this! What a journey this is gonna be! Can’t wait to watch the progress. Engine rebuild, trans, electrics!!! Can’t wait to see those wheels refurbed and a new paint job possibly! Woooh. Gonna be 🔥🔥🔥   Thinking ahead how about that Huracan style kit like DDE had on their Murci???  Let’s go!!!! MURCI, MURCI, MURCI!!!!
Crazy man 😂 Can’t wait for the next video 👊
Are those other chips just to the left supposed to look like that?
You may run into hurdles with this car , but I believe you will definitely smash this project out the park ⚡️🤟  Project Super Snake 🐍 underway ⚠️
I give up how many cars u got now 😂😂 how far u come since the s5
Never gets old seeing you go from 60k subs to over 500k. Cheers to many more Mat
How much did you spend on the Lambo though
Absolutely buzzing you got this Merci! It’ll be a feast for the eyes this series 😍
This has to be the biggest challenge taken yet..but like you said the parts look like they are from Audi, so hopefully your pocket doesn't take a dent (too much!!)
Yes mate been waiting for this! 😭
Why buy a car from a gumball rally? It has a sticker 😁 Like buying a car from teenager
You’re not nobody 😁
Yep!, "YouTube God" 😎
You're going to need a go fund me page 😬 respect for taking it on!
They rolled you, and laught at you due this video, but you will prove these sellers wrong <3
I am enjoying already, great job!
Ed Bolian might be worth trying to talk to at some point
I'm sure you will turn this around but it's definitely the biggest project so far that is an absolute mission. That'll be some content. 👌
Looking forward to seeing this put together
Can't wait to see the finished build😁
Matt your channel and content keeps getting better and better! Smashing it mate!
Can’t wait to see this rebuild!!
Mat the last Time i Checked Tavarish (youtuber) Was SELLING a Lamborghini Murcielago Engine he might help you as a Fellow Youtuber....
This is gonna be a super fun project to follow
Cant wait to watch this journey Matt
Can’t keep up with your projects 😂 great to watch as always!
Your a brave man Matt, I’m sure you’ll smash it though 🔥 🤟🏻
keep inspiring Matt love the content and Journey !  ps Matt there is a lad on youtube who has a board repair business UK based and i would say as good as luis rossman if you know who he is  TheCod3r hes from west mids too and guessing Thats light work for him and would cost pennys in comparison to a new cluster just an idea if your stuck with that kind of electrical work good luck
Best channel on YouTube, hands down
It’s going to be hard! But I don’t doubt you will make it work and go on a trip to Monte Carlo Casino with it :)
How much did you pay!!??
Man this is crazy, I subbed when the M4 came here, now look at ya, like a proud dad
how much was i t
this car is really nice
Rrrrrr..😂😂
you should of buy that yellow one
Love your videos bro
Good luck matt, sure we are all behind you, my first thought was shrek car,
If anyone can sort it it’s you Matt..
I’m so excited for this build mat it’s going to be one hell of a ride
good luck
You are absolutely bonkers 😂😂😂
The kids would consider this a " barn find" in their Forza :) Good luck with this one...
We all know Matt that you'll get this car looking amazing. Can't wait! Good luck.
Good luck mate, balls of steel. I can only imagine a merci will blow your channel up though. Always enjoy the content.
Matty boy, good luck mate,
WHERE LAMBO!!!
Don’t tease, how much did you pay for it ????
l've been here since the S5, what a journey mate ! I pretty much grimace at every purchase but applaud your bravery, this channel will grow and grow due to your ' Hard Work Beats Talent ' attitude.
Another car another awesome (hopefully) story to follow
This is my dream car literally growing up and seeing this its amazing best lambo ever
Good luck with the build. Looking forward to watching the project updates.
I understand the passion for lamborghini, but I think this will be your biggest challenge regarding money . That engine will need a rebuild as will gearbox,
This deserves a full factory restoration to make it the best example out there! What a project Mat, properly looking forward to seeing this one come together! 🎉
Can’t wait to see it unwrapped . I don’t like the green one bit.  But gonna be an amazing build
A murci that done 32 thousand miles in one year 🤬 You are very very brave but you will do it 👍👍
Looking forward to following the journey of this rebuild
Hell yes. I was hoping you’d do this one 🏁🔥
I'm still trying to figure out if you're brave or just plain crazy Mat 🤣. Really hoping this project works out for you - but I just know it will even if it gets tough in places. As people have already said - You really are the man for the job.
I spy with my little eye, someone whi is completely Mad!
Awesome Matt 👌 going to be a mega project
Man I wish the video could be longer 😬😬 great content Matt as always, love your work
This is going to be fcking insane!!
Top man 👍
Can tell Matt is gaining recognition world wide when his channel is being reviewed by Life Of Paulos, that usually review DDE , stradman and all the big car YouTube channels, on the up and definitely hitting 1 million by the end of the year 👌🏻🙏🏻🇬🇧🇬🇧
Will be a great car when done .
Talked to Freddy tavarish he's your guy 👍👍
Wasn't the Murci pre VAG ownership? So therefore a proper Lambo rather something VW cobbled together from parts from a Passat, Audi A4 and other bland VAGness..😂
Best utuber I think ......... I've watched from first video to latest and only keeps getting better. Keep up the good work mat 👏 👍 👌 💪
Can we have a look at the fabia vrs in the back?
Murci love ❤️
Looks like it has been cannabilised as a parts car ,,so you may have a lot of faulty parts
What a journey is waiting for us! And you too, bud! :D Soooo excited
yes we know your off your trolley Mat, 😂but this is going to be great content,, keep safe,,,👌👌
You've come such a long way mate all the best keep up the great work and content 👍
New sub from me, can’t wait to see your journey with the lambo ❤💪🏾
Wish you could  buy James May's crashed evo that would be another amazing project to add to this epic channel
This s hit is the next level...🥰😍💛💙💛😂🏳️‍🌈
Love it!! Can't wait to see it complete 🙌🏻
Everyman seem to be a useless company that break cars for fun
soooo glad you got the green Lambourn Matt, great for the channel, buzzin to see how you fix it, well done mate👌👌🤟🤟
Or kermit 😂
dont make a sv rep and ruin it there just going up in price keep it stock nothing sily with it
Id like to see you do a truck lol next level
Now we talking 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻🕺 this will be a great build 👌🏻✅ you can name it ” Hulk”
Seen you towing this back couple days ago on my electric bike that died as I went past 😂. Good luck with this one 👌👌👌
Your upload are like marvel credit scenes we Wana see what will happen and you keep delivering  posting from south africa 🇿🇦
Gonna be a cracker🫶🏽👍🏽👏🏽
Great project! You have to go back to the OEM green colour!
Once that interior is all cleaned up. It’s going to be gorgeous! Verde faunus I believe
I’m 47 and I have a TT, I’m happy, but hats off for having the balls to do what you do Mat, well done….. Sod the rat race and do what you enjoy…. We are behind your journey. Remember find a job you love and you will never work a day in your life again. I know how hard it can be when cars get you down. I 100% admire what you are doing.
🌰s!
Cool! Dashboard-pcb components look like blown diodes, which sometimes are crowbar diodes for reverse polarity protection(shorting out by design to protect the rest). Smd soldering is pretty easy once u get the hang of it. I used to work at a repair shop for car radios where we repaired similar stuff. Perhaps check at one near u for help.  Assuming it's CANbus you might even be able to rebuild the pcb. If u post some hi res photos of both sides, might be able to help
If you still have issues, just take it to Ian Tyrrell - he'll sort it once and for all!!
I just randomly found your page and I’m already a huge fan!!! You’re a down to earth guy whose just trying to live life to the fullest and have some toys to go with it!!! I say you go all in on that beast because it’s a once in a. Lifetime dream come true!!
I’ll chuck in some quids !
Enjoy that video
What a gamble!! Good for you mat!!  Can’t wait to see this done, I did a track day last week with Everyman racing, I don’t get the impression they look after there cars!! 😂😂😂
Loving the content ur choice of cars u are doing are spot on can't wait til the video keep up the great work :)
Good luck in the project give it the love it deserves
Congrats to you Matt and all the best in taking on this project, you definetly got thumbs up from me ,,, am just glad you not into deep sea diving cos if you went down see titanic you would buy it fix it and sail it round the world
U could hv just done a conversion to manual
So how much was it?
So sick! Taking it to the next level...again
Brave man! Good luck
I share your love for lambo’s all the way back for the countach, Diablo, and your new baby. Looking forward to seeing this one coming to life..
Great content as ever m8
Wow can't wait to see how this one turns out.
Fuck it, love it, risk is the only way to go forward
Did mat say second channel?
Honestly,  I didn't damage that car when I drove it...
Top man......good luck with that ,looking forward to seeing the progress👊👊👊👊
second channel?
Mount Everest To Climb?   Matt Armstrong: Climbed it when when I was 7 🤣🤣🤣
You must be mad Matt, but best of luck hope you pull this one off, will be the pride of your fleet if you do
These videos always brighten up my day and encourage me to do more with my car 😆🚗
When is James may going to appear on the channel for you to repair his evo?
Most of us would just pass by the Murcielago but NOT Mat. You definitely earned your Blue Peter Badge fixing the Aston 😂🙏🏽🇬🇧👍🏽 can’t wait for the Murcielago updates, take care
This will be brilliant to watch....  Good luck mate...
The question everyone is wondering..how much did he pay for it!?
Try getting some vids ov it from the gumball rally theres a sticker on the a pillar ov driver side that tells me its been raged about for 3000 miles
Bro you don't even know how perfect these videos are
Well done buddy. Just subscribed to your second channel
Good luck Mat.👍
F*Kin proud of this guy watched from the blue wrapped s5
Good luck dude
To be honest this one is more of a project than the yellow one and will provide way more content, and that why we're all here. Can't wait for this one lol
You are one brave fella! That's gonna be the king of all money pits 💵💸can't wait to see the roller-coaster ride to getting it looking sweet!
I’m excited for you , looking forward to watching this one get sorted 🤩
This is a epic project, I really wanna know how much you paid for it.  Can't wait to see all the bother you get into with this one and the final product
Mate you’ve definitely lost the plot but that’s what makes it great 😎😂😂
So his job is you tuber? Must pay well! What did he do before being a Tweety bird? No wonder he smiles alot. Life's good 👍
🤣🤣🤣
let the fun start..... nice.... take that board to any good electrical repair shop, have it done in minutes..... 🙂
Fair play to you Mat! The content and the cars are mental and only getting better! Been watching since the TT and you’ll be at 1 Million in no time 💪🏽🔥
Brilliant video!!
Big job mate. You’ll do it though!
Eye lyke Ittalian birdz and karz 👍
You are bonkers Matt, but in a great way! love watching your videos, I look forward to seeing how this one goes!
You are a nutter Matt... I can't wait to see this build unfold! It's going to be an expensive one I fear.. good luck though it's good entertainment.
Good lad:  feeling like I’m at the top of a rollercoaster….!😮
Cannot wait for this. The depth of work required here is huge, but so many new skills to learn and jobs to tackle.
good pick, looking forward to these series
Sell the gallardo quick and buy the yellow one as well 🤙 will make your life so much easier for fault finding, but I think it's maybe a bad time as we're going to go into a recession. Good luck either way, going to be an epic project 👍
Get in! My ultimate dream car, would love a 911 cab but Murci Murci Me!
Lord above - good luck with this one!
Why not the yellow one?? Looked way better
Two Lambos?? That's just gready 😀 You content is great again Matt.  You must carry your ba**s round in a wheelbarrow mate
How much did you pay? you always made a list on the blackboard with prices…please keep doing that!
Big big like. Can’t wait to hear this one straight piped!!!
Absolutely epic !!! What a project. Very excited. 😊

EV conversation .. sell the block.
❤ the channel keep on making these entertaining videos!
The progress of your hard work and channel is mental . Congratulations once more boss
I think you do a good job but.. I wouldn't drive a fixed car that can go +300km? Right?
Another great challenge, everything will be fine. Big hug from Portugal.
I thought you were going to go for the yellow one.
I am gonna watch every episode on this bad financial decision so hyped
Yeaassssss!!!!!!!😊
How long do you think the murci build would take?

Cant wait for the build did u miss the gumball 3000 sticker in the drivers side door jam?
Stradman started with an Audi TT so did Mat. I think I know why my YouTube channel is not growing 😂😂😂
Money pit 10000x
Congratulations matty
Can’t wait for this journey
Shouldn't you hold it up through the wheel and not around the tyre? I thought it was safer that way..
Your videos is epic Boi
Im sooooo happy that you bought the Murcielago 🎉🎉
LONG LIVE V 12, Long live !! 💚
I love your content and I know you will successfully fix this Lambo back to it's original state with a few mods.
“Everything happens for a reason - sometimes that reason is that you are stupid and make dumb decisions!”  Best of luck mate, if anyone can do it, I’m sure you can!
So we not going to talk about how Mat strapped the car down👀
Company you got it from sound dodge.
South Africa 🇿🇦
Well done my son 😂😋
told you to pick the yellow one
Remember you having 30k followers, it’s actually mad to see how far you’ve come bud insanely motivational
Lamborghini is part of VAG so no wonder you found some VW/Audi logos on it
Congratulations on how far you've come, I can't wait to see the project unfold!!
Gotta respect he didnt go for the easy option If matt pulls this off which he will he has defo completed the car game
Oh my life🤨
AHAHA man you always surprise me!

YEESSS!! It's the green lambo!! I'm so happy. I can't wait for this series. Just made my Tuesday. Thanks Mat
Awesome! Looking forward to seeing this get put back together! Congrats!
Another Lambo 😴😴 would have rather seen more work being done on the beautiful old BMW!
Yessssss brilliant idea

nice project this is gunna be but the GTR was definitely my favourite lol
love your cars mat.
Content is reaching Mount Everest levels 🔥🐐
Mat is literally showing the world how it's done. Can't imagine where this channel will be this time next year
Good luck matt your the man for the job!! I’m excited to see how crazy this turns out 👍👍👍
