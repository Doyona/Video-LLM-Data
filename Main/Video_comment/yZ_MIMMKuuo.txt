I love that your accent actually sounds austrian not generic german ❤
Poor Marie Antoinette, she was so misunderstood 😢 I have an obsession with King Louis XVI so I know a ridiculous amount about her life 😂
SHE KNOWS OF THE AFFAIRE DU COLLIER DE LA REINE WOW im impressed.. ppl flund that as a way to make her reputation go entirely to hell
it would be horrifying to go to the future, realize your famous, and subsequently realize that most people are obsessed with your head and what happened to it. knowing that in the future, you’ve been objectified and reduced down to almost nothing but your (presumably severed) head
0:20 aw I wanted to know what the last one said 😂
Do you know any channels were men also talk about history with some humour? I find  this channel very interesting.
Actually King louis tried his hardest to tax the nobility it was the nobilty who caused the revolution they were set up for failer by the nobility and were the scape goats especially her
☺️👏👍🏻
She says it would be difficult to be Queen consort of France without speaking French but George I was king of England for over 10 years while barely being able to speak any English.
Please Karolina make more of this! I'm so obsessed 😅
*laughs in French revolution
HELPPP THE FIRST QUESTION I GAGGED 😭😭😭😭😭
“Mops”? That’s the Danish name for “pug”! There was a commercial years ago with an entertainer and his pug Mopsy/Mopsie and it would always fall asleep 😆
This is better than most SNL skits, the outfit, the accent, the looking away to someone explaining things off-screen (who is also you), the running gag, the dark humor. This video has everything
ok but now i want to google what happened to her head
Okay but now I want to see a version with Jeanne d'arc where all the question are like "Was it true that Jeanne of arc was virgin ?" and her answering like : "Yes, because I have better things to do than ****, like save the France " or question like :"Jeanne of arc was she crazy ?" And at the end she get furious and burn the set (what irony !)
This is a gem.   We need more channels like these.
Marie Antoinette liking serial killer documentaries is something else. This woman has a dark mind, she just looks all cute to the public.
You are so talented!  Love this!
I LOVE this look!!! You look GORGEOUS ❤
So no head?
"in the he was kind of nice" - Marie Antoinette
I watch this and the Madame Curie every time they're suggested. More please 😂
The head part really triggered her, so sorry to bring up such a traumatic memory
I love this
Did Marie Antoinette like to eat cake?
I actually learned a thing. I had no idea she didn't make the cake quote.
I think I would also be disappointed if almost every google search question was about my head.
Karolina should do Harpers Bazaar ,,What I eat in a day" with Marie Antoinette,since French court was known to have lavish and extravagant food
this is so funny
loved it!!!! 🔝💯👏👏👏
I thought she was going to say hola
I learned more about Marie Antoinette in this video then in school. Now I like her.(kinda)
Queen the music group had a song in 1986 called "don't lose your head"
"Let them eat cakes"
And a question I can only assume the majority of Gen Z and after will wonder...  Who is Marie Antoinette?
Necromancing technology brought us this far. bless.
For a moment I was like , damn is she still alive ?
You should add Napoleon's photograph and him saying "i'm average height for the time you JERK!!!"
I can’t believe they resurrected her for this.
Came back from the dead to tell us about her favorite Netflix genre
Her reactions to the first card was hilarious. I love her outfit! It’s a cute parody, but also really historical! SO many people think she said “let them eat cake” but she really didn’t! I like in Dunst’s movie she pointed out she didn’t say it.
Fun Fact: Marie Antoinette was actually Austrian, so in real life she had an Austrian accent.
Didn't she die in the french revolution in the 1600s.
I love this.
Hon hon hon je suis un schnitzel  Double racism!
This was a great episode!
Of course Marie Antoinette likes murder documentary’s
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
This video is amazing! Do more like this!!
I loved this video!. Could you do more like these?.
she was slandered by her enemies.
No head
Queen - Don't Lose Your Head 1986
Katarzyna Skarbek była ciekawą postacią
I can’t 😂😂😂😂
Her Netflix is the queendom of the Law!
Hello! I've just watched the 2006 Sofia Coppola movie about her and I was wondering if any of you could give me an idea of how accurate or inaccurate the whole movie is. Thanks. 🥰
isn’t she supposed to be beheaded right now
Yeah, what happened to your head Queen Marie? 😅
"We did nothing! _Maybe that's why..._ " That line got me 🤣🤣
We need more
I wonder if she could tell us what a woman is?
She doesn't like confused questions. I like how marie antoinette is different with other queens. She answered it simple.
In could be in a movie with that accent! Love it!!
I love watching a video of a Polish woman playing a French queen doing Google search interview in English.
Madame, can you tell me how much is your jewely ?
Bro came back from the Grave to answer questions 💀💀💀
For those who don't want to Google it, her last words were to the executioner after stepping on his foot. "Pardon me, monsieur, I did not mean to do it."
This was amazing and hilarious! What a great idea!
Best video I've seen
She didn’t have a pug. Mops we’re a breed of dog. She also had an early version of the papillon called Thisbe who stayed with her up until she was taken to the guillotine.
Damn Marie Antoinette wasnt this disgusting and ugly
"we did nothing.... maybe that's why"
Marie was ahead of the game
I love this! Ty I honestly think you could play her professionall. She really does not deserve the hate she receives and did not deserve that sad ending to her story. Very funny btw
"Mops" is pug in russian and slavic languages are very similar... she didn't call her pug "Pug", did she...???
💀
Imagine the dread she had that her hair turned white overnight before her execution.
Ok this is epic 😂
💜
Omg you look so good 💓 18th century is my favorite.
Can’t believe we got Marie Antoinette to time travel to the 21st century for this! Tysm for that endeavor
It is hilarious. Can you make Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth I answers to web most asked questions.
woah why are you getting so angry, don’t lose your head
♥️✨🍁☕️🏳️‍🌈📚🍂💫♥️
I LOVE LOVE LOVE how your accent is a mix of German and French. Excellent, top shelf character work. No notes!
responding to angry/hate comments as if i actually believe this is marie is officially my job
In the end Napoleon will still be the winner here. I mean I kinda like Louis 16th and Marie Antoinette but yeah Napoleon was much more powerful I mean he showed that France could be a super power and not being a weak country
You should do Catherine the Great next... would love to see her reaction to the horse thing...
Wow jokes aside this is a   dark historical moment. Your character was on point and I love it
Did Marie Antoinette really had a female personal guardian, Oscar François de Jarjeyes?
''Is marie antoinette on Netflix?'' ''Yes I do have an account''   THIS BIT SENT ME 💀
sgaz
Beautiful dress and hair
stOpp I lOvE this😂😂
I love this, but it feels more like her ghost or spectre. Which makes it funnier.
I think that the real Marie Antoinette would be so glad if she knew that she is a very influential pop icon today and society has become more sympathetic to her memory over the years. She died as a villain and in terrible disgrace.
Your mix of a french and austrian accent is perfectly on point !
What so great about Queen Victoria? I don’t know either.
Hilarious video but also this era looks HOT on you 😍
I guess Marie Antoinette in this one was *Ahead* of her time
WTF??? Is this the real Marie Antoinette???
I just love these!  You're the best! I wish I could watch this segment for every person that are presented in "Secrets d'histoire".
That alabaster skin!
Wtf is this
2:38
bro put her head back on 💀💀💀
Geez, jakie to jest śmieszne
Polish woman acting as Austrian with French accent.
Bonsoir votre Majesté
Well, when you tell someone to keep out of it, and they do, you have only yourself to blame when they take no action! 😂
Victoria wasn't great. She caused Irish Genocide.
Her hair is badly done
The real question that needs answering is what kind of cake was she referring y to o? 🤣
So Marie Antoinette was far from being down to Earth but when France was facing a famine she sold off a lot of her clothes to raise funds for the famine effort and the whole “let them eat cake” line really meant “let them eat bread” she switched from the white bread that the courts would eat to brown bread as a sign of solidarity. She wasn’t a bad person but more of a product of her upbringing and the time’s expectation of the upper classes.
Fun fact: anime “The Rose of Versailles” (1970s) popularised Marie Antoinette and French Revolution in Japan. In that anime there was also mentioned the necklace affair, among other things.
i love your mind
Absolutely brilliant, thanks!
mmOkay.. but why is the Good Queen pretends she's Marie Antoinette? 🤔😀
You did nail the accent though. And it's quite hard to get this mixture of German and French accents in English.
She has a beautiful neck would be a shame to see it cut off
Her mother is actually a ruling Queen
Reminds me of the opera "Ghosts of Versailles"
This was the best!  You need to do more historical people. Queen Victoria next? 😊
The last time Marie Antoinette was alive she was at the guillotine when the people of France chopped off her head.  230 years ago
https://youtu.be/I8hqHDyeyec no this isn't a Rick roll
"It would be difficult to be a french queen if I didn't speak french"  Hey, that never stop the Ptolemaic pharaohs! (except for Cleopatra, obviously).
I actually thought this was from WIRED
“Why is everyone so upset with my head…”
In order to be the queen she likely needed to spend from the royal treasury all the extravagance simply to maintain power at Versailles. French Aristocracy was peak oneupmanship, the queen needed to have all this excess otherwise the Marquis du pate or whatever might embarrass the Royal family by hosting a better pheasant vejazzle or whatever they did.
This is such a good idea! Having guests on as other historical figures would be amazing!
my name is Antho-Annette but it's pronounced as Antoinette or some people pronounce it as how they see it
Let them eat cake 🤣🤣🤣
Why does this video not include the boat-hair?
Could you please do Marie Louise? I beg you :) This video was dope!
When I started watching your videos, I realized that you looked like my old German teacher (German is my native language) in your profile picture and I don't know why, but this just feels right!
And chae from kep1er
Mops literally means pug xd
I read some years ago that Marie Antoinette urged to give the people special bread, which was usually used in the Versailles as a substitute for plates and had absorbed fat and sauces. They were made from luxury dough enriched with eggs and butter. Cake is a translation error that arose when the quote was translated from French to English but it was not understood what "brioche" meant. However, Antoinette's words did not lead to a revolution and Antoinette's execution, contrary to what some English historians later speculated with political motives.
arent you dead?
That wig is awesome. Where did you get it?
Dont't get me wrong but is there a small little german accent in your voice? Or is polish very similar in pronouncing words?
Havent seen you in a long time
I knew the last word before the reveal and still it was funny :)
Given that she knew French Revolution, answered the rumours about her, was still quite friendly and really disappointed about execution and her head, this was taken around 1790-1791
I don't really know why YouTube recommended this to me, but the lady in this video completely threw me off...
I love this
The video of the year
Crazy how well she hides her french accent
Bravo! 😂
*why is everyone so obsessed with my head*  - Marie Antoinette 2023
FAKEEEEEE BRO SHE DIED LIKE 100 years ago broo
I beg of you do part 2 but with Anne Boleyn
A Polish woman playing a Frenchwoman while also trying to do a German-ish accent  Weimar Triangle moment
Did Marie Antoinette Ate Cake?
MAIRE ANTONETTE IS DEAD, DON'T LIE TO PEOPLE
omg i love this video
THEY LIKED HER?????? LOL
I love this video! Bravo!
Your french accent is exquis ma chère
I wish this video had been available in the Earl 1980’s when I was in high school studying the French Revolution. Well done, Karolina!!!
LOVE
The pseudo vomiting scene is Oscar worthy! 🏆  (expect calls from Hollywood agents, Karolina!) ⭐️🤩 🎬
🤣😂🤣 loved it!!
I once got drunk at a party and cried about Marie Antoinette for 30 minutes while repeatedly shouting "They took her F***ing dog away!"
What the hell is this?
It would’ve been interesting to see her reaction over the Google searches of Fersen being her “lover”
I will give Marie this - in the the Affair of the Diamond Necklace, if anything she was the victim of the scam!  [btw, if you haven't seen it,  "The Affair of the Necklace" (2001) with Hilary Swank, Jonathan Pryce and Adrien Brody gives an excellent account of this story]
The acting!
1:44 non I just like cakes! 🍰
<3
Don't remember seeing this on Wired.
Roflmao! That was very funny. Thank you!
Anyone in such a position of power their entire life has to be out of touch in SOME way. But the more I learn about her the more I think she really just didn’t get what was going on. Is that an excuse? No. But it’s an explanation, and tbh if most of us were having to deal with the French court BS she was dealing with on a daily basis, I wouldn’t be surprised if most of us also wouldn’t be paying attention to things outside of that. Unfortunately, all we can do now is speculate,
So funny!!
You are so amazingly funny, and timing is perfect
Why is everyone so obsessed with my head?
People need to stop seeing her as a villain as much as they need to stop seeing her as the poor, innocent victim. She was hit hard by circumstances outside of her control and simultaneously immensely privileged and unwilling to change her ways.
_Pardonnez-moi, monsieur. Je ne l'ai pas fait expres_ (Forgive me, sir. I didn't do it intentionally). I've read somewhere that these are Marie Antoinette's last words. Is it true?  Also, how long does the head stay alive after decapitation?
That was brilliant 😅👏
you forgot the TIRED lol
this is amazing, after the marie curie one, please make more content like this, you are brilliant
Please do one for anne boleyn, catherine howard, mary 1 of england, catherine of aragon & anne of cleves!
"WHY IS EVERYONE OBSESSED WITH MY HEAD?!?"
Oui
Lol
I remember i named my beheaded barbie dolls by Marrie Antoinette and Anne Boleyn
PLEASE DO MORE OF THESE PLEASE
I love this
My French urge to use a guillotine watching this
Plz do one on Cleopatra 🥺
"we did nothing! .....maybe that's why"...
I love this lol
The Victorian Era is only applicable on english speaking nations except the US. for instance during the reign of Queen Victoria, in the German Empire they called it Wilhelminismus - A time period between 1880 til 1918, until Empreror Wilhelm II. abdicated and fled to Exile to the Netherlands.
1:39 lol
"I'm not saying I'm against the revolution, maybe if I was born a peasant it would make sense" - THIS.
I just had to google "eau de pigeon marie antoinette" and... humanity...  I'm freaking disappointed.
LOL I thought she was DED
I absolutely LOVE these videos! They never fail to cheer me up and make me laugh! Thank you so much for bringing attention to all the myths and miseducation around these people 💗💗💗
Very difficoult to do a native german speaker who took a french accent after many years in France and who answers in english
The Waffle House has found it's New Host
the questions about her head were all written by robespierre ;)
Damn Marie lookin bussin
I’m surprised there wasn’t a question about her relationship with Axel von Fersen! 😅
Magnifique
Love this, I would be so much happy if you make this a series, with historical women. Would love to see the Six Wives of Henry Viii Next
Love it! I just saw the movie on netflix the other day 😂😂😂
to all the people who thought this was real: 🫡
Se need a comedy show staring Karolina as Marie Antoinette in the style of The Great.
"Why is everyone so obsessed with my head" LMAOO
So funny, I loved this
Love the switching between the German and French accent 😂😂😂
"Why is everyone so obsessed with my head" 💀💀💀
I'm scared that these are real questions that people ask about history :=)
**laughing in nerdish**
is the dog named after a historic thing of the dog breed or is it royalty having the dog and calling it mops the reason the breed is also called mops dog in the netherlands? anyone know stuff about this?
This is great 😂
I'm in love with these series of videos, I thunk I'm learning more from this channel than any history lesson 😆💖
I love this
Good video, it's very entertaining and I like the characterization of Marie Antoinette in how she looked with her clothes.
I think it's terrible that The Roman Catholic Church didn't make Marie Antoinette a Saint. If Marie Antoinette had been Eastern Orthodox she definitely would have been declared a Saint and a martyr.  The Bureaucracy and Politics of the Western Christian Churches saddens me. Especially nowadays it must be very disheartening to be a Catholic, Lutheran or Anglican
This is an awesome skit :D
I mean I’d love head from Marie Antoinette
Lol this came out on time. A few days ago, I had a discussion with my cousin and he said "You know you remind me of Marie Antoinette. I imagine you saying "Let them eat cake"" and I didn't know how to take it
"Mops" is the German word for "pug", actually. I am wondering if Marie Antoinette's "Mops" was the one naming the race in the German Language.
Thank you, Karolina, for dressing Marie Antoinette more according to the period she lived in than every austrian documentory ever acieved and portraying her character more accurately than any movie/series ever (will). (except Rose of Versailles, of course- which is always excused as it triggered my passion for history) Please bring Elisabeth of Austria ("Sisi") in front of the camera, she suffered a lot on recent TV shows.
Who are you fooling? This is not the real Marie Antoinette. She's dead. I read it in a book.
I love it.
You look SO GOOD
She just called her pug the German word for pug😭
She knew Netflix but not Victorian Era? Did France banned Bridgerton??
*”Why is everyone so obsessed with my head-“* “It’s just what people search you know-“
Oh please continue this historical figure does autocomplete interview. I loved the Marie Curie and now the Marie Antoinette.
tis peak comedic and educational historical content milady thank you
Her not understanding the power of a regnant queen at 1:10 doesn’t really work considering who her mother was…
This is so fake she has been dead for years.
i love this
I REALLY enjoyed this 😂 You are adorable!!!
Low key sad, high key funny. Poor Marie Antoinette
I love this
marie antoinette history is so sad, a child bride and in her last moments she even apologized for stepping on the executioner foot... it's pretty sad how people pin her as the culprit for the french revolution
Part 2 pleasee
The Eau de Pigeon thing is all over online when you search it up, where did you find out it was a myth?
I feel like Marie Antoinette would like Bridgerton, or maybe hate it because she feels it is not 'accurate.'
For a non-native speaker of all three languages it's quite impressive how accurately you spoke English with a French accent that had a German accent of its own.
is MA on netflix? yes i do have an account - you made me laugh hard!
So no head??
Vive le France, mah homies. Kira kira~~
I want one of these for like every misrepresented woman in history Cleopatra totally deserves one
OMG I REALLY HOPE YOU'D MAKE THIS A SERIES AND TRY OTHER FIGURES TOO 😭
"We did nothing! . . . . . . . maybe that's why . . . " brilliant.
She literally got cancelled to death.
💜
You are a genius<3
This was epic! Please make another one! :)
To the nation of France: have you yet apologized to Sofia Coppola? Because she got it right.
Heads up for english speaking people, not everyone thinks Victoria was the greatest monarch. In France we barely know her and our history classes in school don't talk much about her. She didn't really matter in our history as a matter of fact. In reality she was important for anglo saxons, but not for other countries. Plus history is always nuanced, Victoria wasn't always and mostly liked by everyone. You could use objectivity
These are perfect 3:39. Not an ounce of fat.
Give us more interviews - thry are iconic 😄Chcemy więcej tych wywiadów.
Very well done; really REALLY looks like the real Queen! I think the reaction at 2:53 is spot on to what The Queen would've said & HOW she would've said it!
Super ;) Szkoda, że nie "frenczowałaś" bardziej r, bo te momenty, kiedy to robiłaś, bardzo mi się podobały ^^
This was educational and humorous, I love your channel!!!
The long awaited sequel!!!
Guys her pug is just called "pug" but in German🤣
From my understanding, the pigeon thing came from this: The German word for pigeons is "Taube" and the German word for grapes is "Traube", and because the steps for her face wash were all hand written, historians struggles to tell if the hand writing said "pigeons" or "grapes"
I think i need a queen victoria version of this now 🤣
this is amazing! hahaha
I never asked myself before what happened to Marie Antoinette's head, but now I wonder that 🤔
Reading these comments I can't beleive ho much of a bullshit is taught in schools under the gise of history. Back then I had my part of angryness about my teacher because he was very evidence based and we had to be very exact all the time but looking back-I'm not stupid and in delusion like many kids :DDD Jesus Christ what are these teachers doing?????
Not everyone liked Victoria. Idk how the British who are submissive to monarchs thought about her, but as a Kenyan, we don't view her colonial era positively.
... Okay but now I'm lowkey wondering what happened to her head, a question I would've never thought of without this vid but that won't leave my mind now, does anyone knows ?
i love you marie antoinette 🥀
"Why is everyone so obsessed with my head?" iconic line
This was perfect. XD
Ive always been fascinated in french perceptions of Austria and Marie Antoinette during the revolution. A LOT of the hate she got was because she was Austrian, which were France's traditional rivals for power in Europe- factor in the corruption of the french court, and you've got a prefect scape goat! I lowkey wanted to write my senior thesis on this, but unfortunately my school would only allow "social" thesises on during my year, and my proposal was deemed more "political"
Well she was a queen so no empathy from me here
She's not wrong.
So fake and scripted! The real marie and twanette would have lavish earrings and 6 little bitch boy handmaids!!!!!! 😡
Yes the video is 10/10 but the commitment with the pomade- perfection
Fake. There is no Tired watermark on the thumbnail
THANK YOU for raising from your peaceful sleep just to clarify things for us, Your Majesty. Somebody had to say the truth for those who learned history wrong
<3<3<3
VERY VERY funny
You are brilliant.
he pug was named Mops????? maybe that's why in dutch pugs are named mops-dogs.... I'll research but rn it's not telling me much about the name
Almost scrolled by thinking it was the Marie Curie video again, then did a double-take & got so excited! Your sense of humor is like no other 😁
She was born in Austria, but she spoke French ... as her first language ... just like every other European aristocrat at the time.
That was good 🤣
The source of the "eau de pigeon" face wash thing is a book called 'The Toilette of Health, Beauty, and Fashion' that was published in 1833. The funny thing is this book DOES NOT say that Marie Antoinette used eau de pigeon face wash. What it actually has is a recipe called 'Wash a la Marie Antoinette' on the same page as the fermented pigeon thing. A modern blog writer either misread 'The Toilette of Health, Beauty, and Fashion' or chose to lie about the content for better clickbait, because the actual 'Wash a la Marie Antoinette' is a much tamer-sounding recipe made of milk, lemons, sugar, and alum.  The book is available to read for free on Google books. Pigeon water starts on page 73.
Karolina's facial expressions 🤌
Marie Antoinettes English is impeccable, so much so you'd think it was her native language lol.
Hm, she look a lot like that Marie Curie girl. Maybe they are related.
You guys should check out BBC's Marie Antoinette! I'm enjoying it so far!
Now I'm reading all comment section with french accent. Didn't ask for this either x)
I love you Marie Antoinette!! I named my sourdough after you!! <3
She's good 😂.
I happened to have read the Marie Antoinette Biographie by Stefan Zweig. I can definitely recommend it. And Karolína definitely does a good job reassembling her like I imagined her after reading the book 👍🏼
Brilliant 🤩
I love how you got the accent between Austrian and  French. Not easy
Is it the real Marie Antoinette? I thought she is dead at least 40 years? 😕 Why is her hair so big though? Is she from Texas?         Only joking! I remember how several silly commenters replied to your wonderful Marie Curie video 😄 Also, your makeup here is just perfect👌🏻
Hi.
This is hilarious, I’m so glad these intervews are back   Love you, Karolina!
For everyone who may not know. "Mops" is literally "pug" in German. So she just called her pug "pug".
„Mops“ is just pug in German. 😂🙈
Idk why but this gives me horrible history vibes and I ADORE it!
Secretly hoping people think this is real lol
Lollllll. Doesn't know what Victorian era is. But has a Netflix account. 🤣
Brilliant, your creativity and knowledge is amazing
"Let them eat Cake" predated Marie Antoinette.
"Marie Antoinette is dead. You not Marie Antoinette. Dumb lady" - Karolina's haters from the Madame Curie vid back for more 😂
i love these kinds of video, the clothes and make up looked really good, and i love how you portrayed Marie Antoinette. i am aware that she really had no influence on the politics in her time and her cluelessness when in came to those questions and how she reacted everytime she got references to her death made me feel bad for her
Hilarious! Wish it could have been longer! You're so believable and beautiful
Lol
You’re so good.
😂🤣
this is well acted I love it
lmaoooooo
Thank you for the cackles! 🤣🤣💜💜  I always look forward to your vids.
Peak comedy
I'm so glad we finally have a sequel
More of these. Please make these a thing 😹
Brilliant 😅
This is brilliantly done. Absolutely hilarious.
he was called Mops 😂
What do you mean you don't understand your mom was a monarch
OMG A NEW VIDEO <33
I neeeed more of these 😂
1:36 Why not, though. There were English rulers who didn’t speak English.
I love Producer Karolina desperately keeping Marie calm
"I didn't do anything, my husband didn't do anything, my children didn't do anything, we did nothing.  "Maybe that's why."  😂😂😂
I love these videos
I can't believe you do this 18th century hairstyle all with your own hair!
I would love to see you in a tv or web series. Maybe something about working in some kind of museum and dealing with miseducated people and annoying administrators.
thst was great, thank you :D
Absolutely nailed the french accent. The « r » are perfect 😂
well now I want to know what (if anything) happened to her head
oh man I loved the Marie Curie video and i love this one too, i hope you keep making them!
She’s so iconic. I remember that when I was a child I watched the Addams Family show a lot, so I beheaded all my dolls because Wednesday Addams had a Marie Antoinette doll and I used to think it was cute.
i love you so much QUEEN  !!!!!!!!!!
Brilliant! 😍😍 . Ist so creapy that people are just obsessed with the dead.
Dzięki Karolino, jak zawsze.
Love when she does these 😁
Just thank you 💖
Next on Karolina as famous historical Maries the world sees as French but who were actually not French-born:
Until I looked at the channel, I thought this was a joke video, made by wired
This is a perfect video. Please make a series. Marie Curie and Marie Antoinette are not enough 😘
She just seems so personable. I wonder if she has an Instagram
I love you
Hahaha
Je t'adore that for you babe
Eu amooooooo
ahaha the end
🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
Soooo no head???
Like this post mortem service clears the memory of their death or does she know how she died? might help her understand why everyone is obsessed with her head!
omg I show people the Marie Curie one all the time I'm so excited!!!
This was the most random thing to pop up in my feed but I'm soooooo glad it did 😂
Best 2023 video so far 😂
Very nice video, good job :)
This is so funny that I watched it three times in a row!
I love the "WEIRD" format sooo much and this is a great follow up to the original Maria Skłodowska video! I watched that one soo many times and laughed so hard at it and this one brought me the same amount of joy! Great job on the questions and sarcasm, Karolina!
Looooooooove it 😆😆😆😆🧡
Shoulda had a special effects artist put some stitches and whatnot around her neck.
so hilarious!!
Made me think back to my high school history teacher who insisted we get a thorough look into the geopolitical climates that lead to the crises in the present day and started with a very, very in-depth look into the French Revolution and all of its causes, and his proposing that Marie Antoinette was more just a convenient scapegoat.
Only thing missing is throwing the boards
To amusing!  I like how she is irritated about her death.  I would be too if I had had to put up with the horrible things that were said and done to her.  Karolina did a masterful job.  I wish there were more questions about her childhood in Austria, how she saw things in France from an Austrian perspective and her relationships with her parents and siblings.
You have a marvellous sense of humour! 😂
This was so hilarious! Finally Marie Antoinette was given a chance to defend herself! 💪🏻✨ We stan a queen
I just realised I am eating cake while watching this.
I loooove this type of videos so much! Just like you did Marie Currie. Please, can this become a regular thing?
How many "wait youre not her shes dead/i thought she was dead" are we getting this time?
I love your sketches, and the way Marie Antoinette answered these questions (she is clearly surprised by the fact that her head has such popularity)
I love the head jokes hahahaha
"Why is everyone so obsessed with my head"🤣
I demand whole series with historical characters ❤
which famous Marie will get interviewed next?
Brilliant 🤌🏻
I knew she wasn't french but I'd never concidered her probably not having a french accent for some reason
Loved it!!! 🥰🥰🥰
There is this classic biography by Austrian writer Stefan Zweig about Marie Antoinette. It's well worth reading, very well written and nuanced too. He also wrote in a similar vein other biographies, including one about Mary, Queen of Scots.
Karolinaaa, I've just rewatched Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette last night, stop spying on me, I beg you
Was Marie Antoinette the same person as Marie Curie?
Cały czas leciało mi w głowie to oczywiście https://youtu.be/l1yDC0AKvMA :D Świetny film!
Let's be honest she was kind of a scape goat and happened to rule when the peasants have had enough, who thought it would be a good idea for teens to rule a country, today you have to be like 18+ to even buy a pair of scissors.
Absolutely love this! Didn't know I needed  this. Please more
1:10 I actually howled
"Let them eat Taco Bell"
When I saw "marie antoinette head", my first thought was "the internet is a horrible place". Then I remembered Marie Antoinette was decapitated. Not sure what that says about me 😐
Marie indeed never said that about brioches. Rousseau wrote that years after her death to be a petty asshole 😅
Love the layers of truth and myth you managed to achieve in three minutes! Brava.
Queen Victoria, we don't know her 🤣
obsessed with the idea of marie antoinette being into true crime. yes my queen id love to see your zodiac killer scrapbook and your ted bundy moodboards
😅
I love this.. and I so wish this could really happen. Think of all of the answer we could have .. or well maybe not :)
People see Victoria as a good monarch? Why? I know the era is well-known but it has to do with the fact that her reign was so long so a lot happened.
Très reussi
French 1700s style really suits you! I think you said in one video that you prefer the English aesthetic to the French, but French really works for you!
DID SHE KNOW SHE WAS EXECUTED?
This is so well done and funny ! Bravo !
if only the 12 year old me knew that the best way to learn about history is through memes
God, I love that she called her pug "Mops"; it`s German for pug 😂
What a great way to learn about historic figures. I think to make a video like this would be great as a history assignment in schools!
These Interviews make me laugh every time. I want more!
What the hell? Isn’t Marie Antoinette already dead? I literally thought she died.
We definetely need more videos like this 💀 I think Anna Boleyn one would also be cool
Mops is the German word for pug. 🙂
I love everything on this channel, but the "X answers the web's most researched questions" really steal the show for me! It's a great combination of comedy and lowkey history lesson. Seeing the character react to some questions is just peak comedy and the parody of the concept is extremely well made.  In short: me likey
I was waiting for you to make another one of these 😍
This L'Autrichienne is not amused ---- joking --- had a lot of fun. Continuing to munch my "gugelhupf"
I love this! It's just a wonderful burst of fun. You look incredible.
Did Marie Antoinette have a pug? I did, it was called Mops 🤣
I love this, and we definitely need more of those <3
Absolutely historically inaccurate!!!! She spoke FRENCH!!  Yes, yes this is a joke. For the algorythm.
Lol! Fantastic Karolina!
maria antonia was a scapegoat because she was foreign... the let them eat cake was a french minister, for example... i read victoria holt's The Queen's Confession as a kid and I really reommend it... also for hustaccuracy Dancing on the Precipice (Caroline Moore)....  not karolina, i mean fellow comnenters!  also, maria, you look beautiful!
This was so fabulous.  The podcast You're Wrong About by Sarah Marshall and at the time, Michael Hobbs did a wonderful show on Marie Antoinette and how wrong much of what we think we know about her is.  It was a very interesting show.  "Why are they so obsessed with my head" was the perfect exit line for the video.
This was hilarious. The intro and all of the head questions had me dead. When you can, you should totally review the new movie Babylon's costumes. I REALLY want to hear your thoughts on their 20s and early 30s clothes.
“We did nothing… maybe that’s why…” I f*cking love it!
Very funny. Nice hairstyle by the way. 🙂
Bloody Mary Antoinette
Honestly I never thought of things from her perspective. I didn't really think of her as the villain but a very prominent person people were angry on. It really makes you think over it. It's scary how many historical things have been altered so much via perspective..
This is fantastic!
Omg, your accent is excellent :D
"WhY is EVERYONE so ObSessEd with my HeAd!?!" 🤣😂🤣😳
HILARIOUS!!!!!!!!!  Do more of these, plz🙃😂 I  mean you are so good at it. And I love what u have done to your flat, very detailed in all the right ways.
Oh, and no one suspected I was black. Showed them right up to the day of my execution😔
This was so funny i want more of these
So good. Love it.
Marie Antoinette head.  Why do they want to always talk about my head! Think I'll have my face wash with bat water, yes this will make me beautiful! At least once a day!   Then to apply the white beautiful heavy face cream. PERFECTION!
I like the accent . A bit of French and Austrian/German :D
Well done---poor Marie!
I LOVE THESE VIDEOS, although Should I say that Eau cosmetique de pigeon was a very popular tonic water used in the first half 18th century, we can't be sure Marie Antoinette used it (in a way she was too fond of flowers to ever sip them) but it's certain some of the dames at the court used it. There, thank you very much.
Impeccable editing, to go with the impeccable costume.
Head
Absolutely loved this!
*Marie Antoinette head* "You don't have to answer this one." Not even a minute in and I'm already dead.
Iconic
Her saying "let them eat cake"... when what she said was "well, give them bread".
Brilliant! Just makes me want to invite her over for tea and cake. 🥰
Made me smile. Thanks.
I love these videos! Every one of them is hilarious. 🥰😂 Also, you could seriously be a hand model! Your hands are so beautiful!
Wow!!! The whole attire is fabulous.
Immediately obsessed!!!! Loved this type of video from you.
Ha!!! 🤣🤣🤣 it's so good to watch ur videos again Karolina
THANK YOU for this
So cool. Best Marie Antoinette i seen
You know, Karolina's humor can be used to teach. I'm laughing but nodding at the same time so weird.  LoL
This shit's got good timing
Super clever, as usual!
That was fantastic!
this is hilarious
But what did happen to her head
This was genius. Love it.
I'm here for the "You're not Marie Antoinette!" and "I thought Marie Antoinette was dead, you go kween!" comments.
The more I learn about her the sadder she gets.
https://youtu.be/Tw98kP3xrfk For further humanization of Marie
I haven't even watched this yet & I already know it's fabulous!!!
I cannot sufficiently express to you my DEEP affection for this video.
Marie:  “I quite like serial killer documentaries” Maximilien Robespierre:  *heavy breathing*
😂
I'm so glad you've done another of these
this is so funny!!
Aaaaaw. I feel so bad for her. ❤️ Everytime the head question comes up she is so upset. xD Poor thing.
this is so funny
👏👏👏 I love these shorts. So well done.
I feel kinda bad for her, especially how sad you acted as her
Another great one. I LOVE these. Poor Maria Antonietta.
You should do Anne Boleyn and Alexandra Feodorovna
This is peak historical comedy, and I am here for it.
I hope that Voltaire is forced to watch this in whatever pit of Hell he is roasting and decaying in.
What! What was the last question that made her walk away😂. Thanks for the video ❤
If anyone is wondering what happened to her head, it got buried with the rest of her body in a mass grave. 20 years later her remains were exhumated and her head was mummified which allowed her recognition. She was later reburied in royal crypt. They found Louis XVI as well.
A lot of metaphysical questions arise.
MORE!
Back then, they needed a scapegoat and blamed everything on Marie.  Poor Marie.
I was hoping for an answer to the champagne glass question
I wish she'd had to answer a question about the Lafayettes, but I assume that most people don't Google search them together.
waiting for all the comments from sweet summer children asking if this is the real Marie Antoinette like they did with the Marie Curie vid
You are such a good actress. Very well done.
SO good!
This is brilliant!  Awesome work! 🎉❤
Love!  And I do think she very well knew about powerful female leaders, since her mother was empress Maria Theresia.
I also enjoy the Netflix serial killer documentaries.  Maybe they will make one about Robespierre.
I would LOVE to see you do more of these! The Marie Curie one was great, and the slow realisation M.A. has about her priviledged inaction was so good
We just wanted to know about the head, why so sensitive about the topic
Love it.
You are a hoot!
"they liked her? why?" just killed me. Very nuanced humor, and well researched too. Loved it,
Poor Marieee🤍 she seems such a lovely woman 🤣🔪
This was brilliant and funny, so well done!
Love your skits! This one was gold!
I'm laughing so hard!!! 🤣
Yes, love that M.A's history is getting revised. Such a tragic figure who should have never been Queen.
25 secs in and I’m already dead 😂 … and so is Marie Antoinette apparently 👀
The writing, costume, makeup, acting, everything about this is top-notch. Love it!
i love these!!!
Please make a second one with Queen Elizabeth I or Mary Queen of Scots!
Why are people so obsessed with my head 😂
I enjoyed this very much, thank you
Can’t wait for the rest of the Marie’s to be interviewed! Since Marie-José is in exile I’m sure she has plenty of time for an interview. And Marie-Catherine, Baroness d'Aulnoy—the stories she could tell!
Brilliant! Fckin amazing
Love the accuracy on the accent.  It would be iconic if you said “I don’t know her” à lá Mariah when speaking of Victoria 😂
In fact Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI had very good relationship. Louis loved his wife, he was the first king of France since Louis XIII, who had no mistresses (though Louis XIII was probably homosexual, so he cheated in other ways, as his relations with Anne of Austria were bad; in that case Louis XVI was first faithful husband on French throne since Francis II, who died as a teenager). There were rumours that the queen had an affair with the count of Artois, future Charles X, but Artois was well-known womaniser, gossips linked him with almost every woman in France, so it is probably an utter nonsense and Marie Antoinette was a faithful wife too.
poor Marie! Life's not fair... so is history.
That was amazing 😂 your videos always make my day, Karolina!!
I love these skits so much ❤ I’m glad you did Marie Antoinette and I like the portrayal of her
This was absolute gold!
This is funny and sad in same time🙂
This is really well done.   "why is everyone so obsessed with my head" bless her heart 😭
Me: *going to Google what happened to Marie Antoinette's head*
I feel like you got into her shoes and delivered her personality so well, Karolina! We need more.
You NEED to do more of these lol
LOL! Very well done! 👏
Hilarious. Absolutely hilarious! You are so clever with your editing
OMG what ???? I thought Marie Antoinette was dead ???? I just did a school presentation about her and I read they cut her head !!! What are you doing, Karelia ?? Irresponsable person you are liaaar   (it's ironical; I hope you get the references)
I haven't even watched this yet but just the premise is so fantastic 😍😍 love it!!
A little bit sad about the Victorian Era thing, Marie you were great too 😭❤
Thank you thank you thank you this is all I have ever wanted and didn't know
Very smart..really funny!
Wow I can't believe Marie Antoinette is alive! I really thought she was dead but HERE SHE IS BEING ALIVE AND ON THE INTERNET. Really can learn some amazing things on YouTube.
This is sad. Good job, Karolina.
I love how Karolina doing such a detailed go at this accent(s) on top of her own, in an entire other language, ends up sounding a bit Welsh 😂 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
I played Marie Antoinette in a long-running play in New York. Your portrayal is lovely! Great work!
Utter Perfection!!! 😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
thank you for this pure gold ✨💅
Wasn't this posted before?
dat accent doe X3
🤣
So good !
Love it!
Hilarious!  😂  And the pearls in the hair?  SO pretty!
That was hilarious and awesome. Thank you!
“It would be difficult to be a French Queen if I didn’t speak French.”  I don’t know.  Not speaking English worked for  several generations of kings of England who came Normandy and  later from Germany.  Lol😂.
THIS IS EVERYTHING.  xxx
Poor woman.
the accent is on point
That was really funny, Karolina! You could perform this on a comedy show. Actually, it's much funnier and more clever than what I see on a lot of comedy shows. Well done!
just comic gold!
"I really like serial killer documentaries." I actually cackled like a donkey and I'm okay with that lol <3
Broooo???  Isn't she like supposed to be dead?? I didn't know wtf?
the accent is brilliantly subtle, like you could've gone over the top but instead you went for subtlety and that adds to the camp
Here's the thing, and I don't know if you did it on purpose or just got lucky, but your accent for MA is perfect, in that you are speaking English with a French accent modified by an eastern European accent.  In MA's case, that would be Austria.  Most people think of MA as French, which is sort of half right.  Anyway, fabulous job !
I really hope you will make more of these.
So did she name her dog "Pug" or was the breed later renamed after her dog? (Mops is just German for pug)
I worked on the Marie-Antoinette TV Show in costume making, and started to learn more about her, and it completely changed my perspective. All the misogyny and xenophobia* she went through...
Hi i am also Marie Antoinette, Maria Antonina to be exact lol, greetings from western Poland sis
Solid. GOLD.
To her credit, she didn't actually have to speak French, like she wouldn't have been the first monarch to not speak the language of the land they rule. Like I get were she is coming from, but that is a very significant thing that happened (I am looking at Charles I of Spain who mainly spoke German and George I of England who also mainly spoke German in particular)
I can't wait for this video to go viral and for everyone in the comments to think that this is the real Marie Antoinette, then get upset at Karolina when they realize the real Marie was executed in 1793.
iconic
love the colour scheme. And I have to say that this isn't the 1st time I've observed that the white powdered hair seems to bring out people's eye colour so nicely, Karolina's is such a lovely warm shade! :-) Great video!
Ok it’s been literally 2 seconds let me pause: this [r]. In “Marie Antoinette”.  Absolutely PERFECT, I think it’s the first time I ever hear a non-native YouTuber nail the French [r] this greatly. 🤩🥹
Waiting for the "ThIs IsN't MaRiE aNtOiNeTte" comments like what happened with the Marie Curie video.
Your austrian-french accent is on point
This is such a funny idea,,, the slow realization of we didn't do anything.... oh maybe that was...  why
The french revolution was a mistake.
The exit had me giggle
I haven't seen any of those comments yet so here I go: Marie Antoinette? I thought she had died????
You even powdered your wig! Love it!
Her last words, for the record, were 'pardon me sir, i did not mean to do it' to the executioner, whose foot she stepped on.
I love these videos 🤣
😀😃😄😁😆😅🤣😂🤭🤗!
Iconic!
REMEMBER PEOPLE! SHE IS NOT THE REAL MARIE! DON'T SEND ANY HATE FOR A LITERAL COSPLAY!!
The accent was a very nice touch
I like serial killer documents too😂🤣😂 ...Great video!
Very cute.
I’m so pleased you brought the famous Madame Antoinette alive again. It’s a shame she never really had a bright future “ahead”
Cute outfit. Did you make this Karolina? And bravo on the hair.  That's a lot of work for for under 4 minutes.  By the way, that is you asking the questions of Marie Antoinette, is it not?
Now I want to know what indeed happened to her head. 😂😂😂This video is great. Love it. 😂❤️👍
I love the autocomplete interviews with historical women, and this one was fantastic...no idea her head was such an important point of inquiry....
I sincerely hope that someone makes a period series about Marie Antoinette and casts Karolina in the lead role!  Excellent acting!
"We did nothing" .... 👀👀🤯
Let them eat cake was attributed to many people even before the reign of Marie Antoinette. It was even published before then. So was “let them eat brioche”. It’s silly. The tabloids played a huge part in her story, and paparazzi were just as responsible for her death as they were for Princess Diana’s. Who, btw was also harshly criticized and blamed the same way UNTIL she died. What we are seeing them do to Meghan Markle, you might not be old enough to recall but, it was done to Diana. Then, suddenly she was a martyr and remembered only as the “People’s Princess”. Choose your alliances and what you believe carefully. Don’t let anyone think for you.
This is PERFECT ❤
Poor Marie Antoinette, all she wanted to do was DO NOTHING 😭
I love your sense of humor.
I love the whig!
omg I love when you do these. kinda wanna see a historical author next. like one of the bronte sisters or jane austen or mary shelley.
I love how she knows Netflix but not the Victorian era. 😂
I was going to get all know it all about The French queen not being from mid Europe but then I  remembered ..
"I don't understand! What about my dear Mother?! She was also Queen, a great Monarch!!!" Perfect acting! Loved the "eat cake" part, it's such a misconcept in history...
No mentioning that Queen Victoria was considered 'a great monarch' only because under her rule Britain was killing and pillaging millions of people all over the world, thus making many of its citizens wealthy and content with Victoria's leadership.
Brilliant
the accent really pulls it all together for me ~
This was so entertaining! 😂 Would love to see more of these cuz you did a great job!
Spot on and just flawless! 😂
The video is great, Karolina you are so beautiful
So is this Marie Antoinette sort of like a ghost and aware how she died or is she a time traveler from the before times? I'm very intrigued.
this made me think some really nasty things happened to her head
Well, her father was François Étienne de Lorraine (Lothringen), so yes, she was partly from french origin. She spent less much money than any french président...  By the way, you had lots of english Kingston as Richard Lionheart who did not speak a word of english...
The sequel we all very much needed
As a person who loves Marie Antoinette, this is brilliant.
In fairness...I barely looked at her head the whole video.  >_>;
RIP Marie, I'm sorry that people in the internet don't know that rococo isn't 19th century
Imagine people would believe that Marie Antoinette is still alive because of you lmao
Karolina/ Marie,  well done!  " Why is everyone so obsessed with my head"? Lololololol
I love the delicate French accent~
so, the interesting thing about the 'cake' quote is that cake, speaking as we know it today, wouldn't really become a thing until after marie antoinette's execution. during her time, 'cake' was essentially a sweetened bread.  besides, i honestly can't imagine how her offering to give her starving subjects cake, even as we know it today, would be a bad thing? like, sure, cake isn't something you should eat for every meal but goddamn if i was starving and someone said 'here, have some cake' i wouldn't go having their head cut off?
Dear Karolina.  Dziekuje bardzo for making me look up  "Eau de  Pigeon" 🤣 (probably not the weirdest  beauty recipe, real or fake,  that people from the past have come up with though) Very nice performance, and as someone else said, mixing up the accents worked really well and helped bringing the character to life.
Madame Veto avait promis, de faire égorger tout Paris! Mais son coup a manqué, grâce à nos canonniers!
Great acting!  This was great.
Yes
nic lepszego już dzisiaj nie zobaczę
Do hitler or kim next.
lol
Look at that late 1700's french glamour ✨ meme mom slaying as always ✨🌺
No, Marie Antoinette did NOT live in the Victorian Era.
I also have a question. How is you mother doing? Is she still very politically busy?
i’ve never been this early in a video
YAAAAAAASSSSSS!!!! This needs to be a series!!!
OK but where IS Marie Antoinette's head now I really wanna know
Marie: *dodging questions about her head* People asking those questions: „...so no head?”
I LOVE THESE SO MUCH
Perfection
chop chop
What is this accent????? :'D <3 <3 <3
I was JUST thinking abt ur Marie Curie video! What excellent timing!
Marie Antoinette is one of my favorite historical figures because I think she is a great example of the nuance present in history that is often ignored. Yes her inaction and excess was a continuing factor to the French Revolution, but she herself had almost nothing to do with the policy and economic situation that caused the revolution in the first place. She is so unfairly portrayed as this historical villainess, when in reality she was more of a victim of circumstance. Also her aesthetic is just iconic.
karolina zauwaz mnie kocham cię
I like how you were playing Marie and the interviewer on the side, as if you were really there on the side. It was perfect. 😄👍
i love this videos so much, thank you <3
I like the outfit. could we get a video of hair makeup and dress.
”I didn't do anything!” ......... Cogs turning in her head ... 👁️👄👁️
What a fabulous outfit!
Have you read the Stephan Zweig biography of her? A wonderful book, fully recommend. Also the Norma Shearer film is amazing.
Wait, Marie Antoinette really had a pug called "Pug"?
lol!!!!!
Comedy gold
comedy genius. I'll never rely on Wikipedia again.
I never thought about this before, but the idea that an entire revolution was caused by ONE person is actually quite silly? Like there are numerous factors for these types of things, and Marie would NEVER have been the only aristocrat overspending and ignoring the pleas of the poor.  It starts to feel like another "Eve" situation. Blame the stupid woman.
this was😂 cute :)
I bet Marie Antoinette will be a famous tiktoker if she lives today
"it would be very difficult to be a french queen if I didn't speak french"  A significant group of kings and queens of England look on with (non-English-speaking) bafflement.
His name was Mops :)  ...Anyway back to the beheading questions!
yes i have a pug his name is pug in another language
Pug called Mops xDDDD
this was brilliant! and is this real powder on your hair?
Yeah, true crime club with Marie Antoinette, yes queen! XD Don't forget to watch also Bailey Sarian and te Casual Criminalist on Youtube though ;)
Robespierre is busy making accounts to dislike this.
The pug was colled Mops?? Lmaoo well she stayed true to her Austrian roots
I'd love a whole series of these on famous historical women just like this. The length of the video, the sass, the costume, everything is perfect 🤩 I could watch a hundred
Bardzo lubię tę serię z przebieraniem się za jakąś postać historyczną i czytanie proponowanych wyszukiwań w google
i wish schools would show these kinds of things, like do an introduction for your class about french revolution let's say! kids actually learn some stuff, get entertained (which makes info easier to remember) and kids can relate to the content they get
They really wanna know about her head, uh
I love it ❤ I'm a Marie-Antoinette fan and you did her look really well and the robe a la polonaise looks so cute 🥰 I think you even look kind of similiar to the french queen 😊
Love this.
💀
This is so well done I love it ❤
i could not stop laughing!!!
It was awesome!
Ok but in all seriousness, those colors look fantastic on you.
I like how she knows what netflix is, but not the victorian era.
❤❤❤
This is soooo goooood
Delightful! Love the costuming and the acting/responses were perfect. Love the slow realisation about inaction being the cause.
Waiting for the people who really think that she is Marie Antoinette
Jest pani bardzo zdolna. Dziekuje.
You look just like her portrait! (minus the round facial features, 'cause of XVIIIe century idea of attractiveness) but the powdered hair and eyebrow,  the pearls are👌🏻
yessss!! make this a series, we need Victoria next :)  excellent accent work btw
This is GOLD! 😂
Okay, this was excellent. Your acting was top notch. Loved the script.
AmazingxDd i debate If i should Show this my History teacher
Loved this. Gave me Taika Waititi vibes!
Honestly, after this, #JusticeforMarieAntoninette ✊
I have to agree with Marie's response in how she didn't cause the revolution. I feel like her husband's grandpa and great-great-grandpa caused people to starve and her husband was meek enough to not outright murder all the revolutionaries in one go.
“I quite like serial killer documentaries” - Marie Antoinette, 2023
"It would be difficult to be a French queen if I didn't speak French." It didn't look like you had an easy time either way, what with the courtiers saying you couldn't have babies and the common folks wanting your head. All that jazz.
I don't know why, but I imagined the real one answering all these questions if Internet would have existed in that era.  I loved the video! And really felt bad for Marie, since she didn't have experience in politics as well as her husband. Both were victims of their own time and the ambition of their own court.
My great(x6) grandma was Marie-Antoinette's last handmaid (Adélaïde Henriette Genêt), whom the queen used to call her "Lionne" (lioness). She jumped to her death rather than let herself be captured by the revolutionaries :(
This is the best thing I've seen all day! i Luv Marie Antoinette. She was a fashion icon!
Acting is so good it sold the whole joke
Maybe people liked Queen Victoria because she popped out babies so much more quickly than Marie. lol
Am I the only one who expected a mention about the Addams Family?
She's one of the most underrated nobles in history in my opinion
I assumed people were asking if the Sofia Coppola film was on Netflix. But who knows with time travelers? 😂
this is fun but also sad. it's mostly sad :(
Last Words: The answer is, "Pardon me. Sorry for stepping on your foot, Mr. Executioner." 😂
"what's Victorian era?" Made me laugh so hard ajahahahhahahaha
Magnificent
Wow, I have once read about you! I had no idea you are still alive!!!
Head of Marie Antoinette: why are you obesessed With me?
I respect the person behind the camera telling her to skip any questions she's not comfortable answering
We most definitely need it with Joan of Arc and at least one of Henry the viiith wifes
It is. PERFECT
Woweee this was posted on my bday!! This is the best present lol
"Why is everyone so obsessed with my head?!" 😭😭
Karolina's videos make my day so much better.  Bless.
you are so good!!!!!!
"I like serial killer documentaries" sent me 🤣
This was so funny!  Totally worth powdering your hair and dressing up.
love heeer
I loved the confused "I don't understand" and ending the whole question with that statement lol Also you look great in this episode, wthe whole stylization looks incredible
Wait isn't Marie Antionette dead????  Guys I think this might be a comedy YouTube video, she isn't even the real Marie Antionette!
I’m going to leave a lighthearted comment and just compliment on the absolutely beautiful look.   You’re looking gorgeous Marie Antoinette 😘
The part of the off-camera person trying to explain that the people loved an English queen. 😂  “I don’t understand…”
Robespierre did nothing wrong
What an ICONIC COMEBACK of the series!
Great, now I wonder what happened to Marie Antoinettes head
I love how she knows what Netflix is but not the Victorian Era 😂
Fantastic XD Empress Sissi of Austria next, please ;)
this is brilliant, nothing beats Marie Antoinette realising that hse was in the wrong lmao
le "marie antoinette" accent is spot on really good thx for frenchies like me who lokk your sketches and you speak correctly the words 🙂
"what happened to her head?" hahaha people search for the dumbest stuff.
Thanks for aknowledging that the "let them eat cake" quote is a myth
I love these though nothing beats the Marie Curie one, the lack of recognition there is just too heartbreaking.  Regarding "let them eat cake" in French it's Brioche, which is not cake but simply a more luxurious sweet white bread with butter and eggs but certainly no cake. It ever made more sense to me after I knew that.
after discovering your channel through the maria sklodowska vid this is such a great sequel after all the years
❤
After playing a Polish woman who became French, Karolina now rises to playing an Austrian woman who became French.
*"Every palace must have a Hall of Mirrors : gotta check yo'self before ya wreck yo'self!"* - Marie-Antoinette Josèphe Jeanne de Habsbourg-Lorraine, called "Marie-Antoinette d'Autriche" (1755-1793), Queen Consort of France.
LOVE THAT FOR YOU GURL
I can’t believe! That’s amazing 😍😍😍
Surprised Karolina restrained herself from talking about the boob glass
Just finished the BBC show today, so this was good timing. 😂
Honestly at least more people knew about her than Marie Curie
These videos really show off your comedic timing :D and I always (embarrassingly) learn something new
A very good video and verry well played, too.
We love to hate her, no lie. 😂
LOL u did it great!! You certainly look kinda like her, if u had blue contacts... Wow By the way Antoinette forgot to mention that her husband was related to her, both of em were descendants of Louis XIII and Anne of Austria (Spain, Habsburg) and one of Louis grandmother's was an Habsburg too! Marie Antoinette didn't expended that much compared to her brother in law, who then became king as Charles X of France and tried to restart his reign as it was in the old days, Marie Antoinette was the last queen of France of the Ancient Regiment because there were some other queens of France but it was after the french revolution and one empress (Eugenia de Portocarrero y Palafox, she was a Spanish noble woman, this is a gossip but her sister married the duke of Alba, one of Spain most nobles families and her descendants are cute), the later empress was obsessed with Marie Antoinette
A Polish woman playing an Austrian woman speaking English with a fake French accent. Quite well too.
Next time bring someone who can actually talk about their death and what happened to their head, please.
This was wonderful! Thank you.
Her learning about all the bs modern society thinks of her was hilarious :D
Queen of comedy is back at it again (no I don't mean Marie Antoinette lol). Please make more of these historical figures answering Google questions!!
More of this  I need more of this
3:08 she sure looks like she’ll beheading to the bathroom soon🤨
For clarifying purposes, Marie Antoinette is LONG DEAD.
“Serial killer documentaries”
Love the humor, the content! And love the costume 😍
I'm coming for you🥖.
I was thinking about the Marie Curie video a few days ago and I can't describe how happy I was to see this today!! I love Karolina's skits, they are always a treat to see.
I missed your roleplays! You look amazing by the way!
How have people already commented on this hours ago when it s only been 45 minutes??
'my husband didn't do anything' Even the biggest royalist on the planet would have to admit, trying to sell out your people so you can be king again is at the very least pretty sinful. Like, even if you believe in divine right and you think it isn't treason, there's _no_ way that isn't at least on par with Saul trying to go behind God's back to scheme with the Witch of Endor.   Antoinette and the kids didn't deserve to die, though, I do agree there.
I got all my fanfic thirst of the french revolution quenched by the anime "The Rose of Versailles". Watch it. 🌹 ❤️
BEAUTIFUL!!!!!! The auto complete interviews are my absolute favorite I freaking love it when you do these!!!!
Incoming DMs to Karolina asking if she (Marie Antoinette) is still alive like they did with Marie Curie.😂
Let them eat brioche!
This's kinda sad =(
Brilliant! Can you do Elizabeth I next???
I learned more about her in this video than I did in school. Honestly though I love how you humanize historical figures in these skits!
loved this, rip marie - one of the most misunderstood figures in history!🤍
I see a powdered wig, I see Karolina’s face, I click.
Wonderful work as always!
I really like how it's unclear if she's somehow aware of her own death and is irritated by the reminders or just feels like those questions are lowkey threats.
So why were certain questions not answered?
Wait... did she really call her pug "pug"?  Also love how Karolina tries to do a French and German accent at the same time :3
I've never felt more vulnerability radiating from Marie Antoinette. That was very well acted.
She truly was born in the wrong era, if Antoinette was a queen of France in any other era she could've been adored but she became queen when France was already on the way to revolution and wasn't very friendly with Austria , what happened to her kids and friends is truly disgusting , when i read about princess Lamballe's death i lost a part of my faith in humanity and gained a part at the same time because of her loyalty to her friend
As a french, I learned much of this bullshit in school in the 90s, that she caused the Revolution and that she ruined the entire economy of the country. As I learned more about her as an adult, I started to feel really bad for what happened to her (and even more to her children). So this was a very bittersweet skit, and very well well done! Also, I love that french/german accent you used, and that you emphasized the "R" in "french" when she explained she is Austrian so she speaks both german and french, this is such a cute touch because it did sound rather native xD
So good 😩😂
I loved her reaction when hearing about Queen Victoria. That little eye twitch was perfection.
As a proud french, I loooved this impression of Marie-Antoinette, it was both sad and funny. Karolina you're the best 🥰
YOU FORGOT THE "TIRED" LOGO ON THE THUMBNAIL QUICK CHANGE IT TO LET PEOPLE KNOW HOW DONE WITH EVERYONE'S BS MARI ANTOINETTE IS
3:04I never heard that one. Wow. People really like to beat the "Before modern plumbing people were disGUSTANG" dead horse, huh?
Karolina, you are the best 😂😂😂
Tbh the 18th century is a good look on you meme mom
Louie the 16th was such a precious lad. He just wanted to read! Darling nerd. I feel so bad for him! 💔
Being a student of history I've really come to appreciate points where France has "officially had enough of this shit"
Omg your accent is so spot on ! What a great video ♡
MOPS.
Her pug being called Mops is hilarious because that is the name of the breed in Denmark

best one yet
He was also 15 when they were married.
I am absolutely in love with Marie Antoinette! Thank you, great job!
Can we have a review/reaction to the historial accuracy in Rose of Versailles (70ies animated series from Japan) now....maybe ..please?🤣
You look gorgeous ✨
I was just watching the Marie Antoinette movie and I get the notification for this video lol
Next, Marie Leszczyńska? (for uneducated commoners: she was also queen of France, and wife of King Louis XV, and married him in Strasbourg, though he was not there, oh and she was Polish of course )
Everytime I think of her white dress, I just cannot help to think that it was a political message, it is just that I cannot decode it.
-We did nothing! ...maybe that's why...
Mon dieu, you are talented!
I remember reading in a history book that she was not the aristocrat who said "Let them eat cake" but it was misattributed to her. This was hilarious! Job well done Karolina! I love your historical comedy! :)
Βetter Marie Antoinette interpretation than that new Canal + plus series!
I would like to point out that "pug" translates to "mops" in german, and considering how close germany and france are, the woman had no creativity or was a lil sneaky
👏👏👏👏
So she has a Netflix account but doesn't know what the victorian era is??????????????
There's a certain pathos to Marie Antoinette's execution. The historical record indicates that she was beginning to take her duties much more seriously and was actually trying to become a more competent monarch.  The American Revolution undoubtedly influenced her as the French public had become VERY interested in "the American Experiment" (a Democratic Republic that invested governing power to the people).  Too interested for the comfort of ANY ruler.  She never said, "Let them eat cake," but it was such a compelling apocryphal quotation: The disregard she had hitherto exhibited toward her people was such that they could easily BELIEVE she said it.
Meme Mom's back at it again with the TIRED autocomplete interviews, folks!
10/10, no notes (also no head, but mainly no notes)
i don't know if it was on purpose but Marie Antoinette was very famous for being really uninterested in languages and having a really thick accent in French (now, the 18th century was the golden age of satyre, and she's a very controversial figure whose image was manipulated by by over 2 centuries of french media) but, as a french speaker, to me, you do sound an awful lot like a german speaker who's used to speaking french and who is sliding her french accent into english
Karolina is a gem. Great content
"Is Marie Antoinette on Netflix?" "Yes, I do have an account. I quite like serial killer documentaries"
Repaul: “Marie Antoinette, how’s your head?” She: *Stares daggers at the camera*
Could you imagine being sent to the future to do an interview but then have to go back to your time with knowledge of how you die? I couldn't.
HAHAHAHA ZAJEBISTE
this is now the best monday ever
SHE ACTUALLY GOT TO ANSWER A COUPLE GOOD QUESTIONS!! it's a revolution people
this video made my whole day.
loved the video<3  this is so cool!
"we did nothing...." heh
This is great!! Currently watching Marie Antoinette on BBC Iplayer too :)
I need more of these series omg
😂😂 Marie Antoinette is one of my favorite Queens
very cute and you look simply gorgeous!
I often make assumptions on people based on their opinions of Marie Antoinette. If they see her as a villain who caused the entire revolution single-handedly, for example, I assume that I will be promptly leaving the conversation and finding someone new to talk to.
lmao
I LOVE THESEE
I love this. we need more of these lol
This was so fun!!
MOTHER KAROLINA FLEXING HER FRENCH PROUNOUNCIATION AGAIN 🤭🤭
I don’t know how it was back then, but today it’s rather bad form to continually make reference to someone’s execution.
not her STORMING OUT she said enough is enough!!
Awe yes another episode of my most favorite series on the web <3
your french accent is sooooo pretty 😍🥺
The sequel we were all waiting for 🤩
I like how this video implies that she and her family are somehow alive and have a netflix account, like some kind of ghost in touch with today's culture. Great video as always!
I love this historical figures autocomplete interview format😂😂😂
Oh, you even did a dschörman accent, absolutely great!
You really look like the OG
The reaction to Queen Victoria…seeing a brain explode in real time was perfection. As with the growing frustration with questions about her head - absolutely glorious.
I'm obcessed with Marie Antoinette since iI had 4 years old. Thanks karolina for the birthday present!
Last one was Marie Curie, now Marie Antoinette. Why not queen Victoria?
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
So about the pigeon thing! The German word for pigeons is TAUBEN. The German word for grapes is TRAUBEN. Whoever was looking at her handwriting either misread or mistranslated it. A skincare with grape juice is obviously much more likely than pigeons. Come on.
I´m studying history and when i was learning about french revolution, I always felt that Marie Antoniette was really missunderstood and badly treated queen. From what I read it really seemed like they (Marie and Louis) were trying their best but it just wasn´t enough. If they were ruling in any other period, they would be fine... Unfortunately, they inhereted broken and unfunctional economy that drove people to revolution. I feel like there wasn´t much they could do... Poor Marie Antoinette did nothing wrong!
Now here came people who did not know that she is died)) Like the last time with Marie Curie)))
Ok but what DID happen to her head?
Cutely funny :D
This is my favorite type of video Karolina does! But it's good that they're spread out so we cherish them when they DO get uploaded. Seriously hilarious!
Thats not the reAl Marie. I tjhought she was ded. dis is soooo fake!
I love everything about this!!
Love this! Quick thing though, the pug wasn't actually called "Mops" mops is just the name for a pug in several languages and Marie Antoinette owned more than one during her lifetime. Sadly she was never reunited with the first one :(
This is genius 🥰
I want to hug her :<
let's hope we don't have a repeat of the comments on the marie skłodowska curie autocomplete interview, no, karolina is not marie antoinette, or trying to commit identity fraud. this is comedy.  anyways, this is brilliant as always :))
🌟🌟🌟🌞💋🥂
Great video that was funny, to boot, but also thanks for educating people. Loved this.
Why are you so funny and talented
I love how her pugs name is "mops" that's just the German Word for pug xD
Someone probably already said this in the comments somewhere, but I wonder how long it'll take before someone points out that Marie Antionette is currently deceased and this isn't really her. 🤣🤦🏼‍♀️👍
Yes!
As a French it's always fun to see people trying the French accent!
I love how this video is both entertaining and educational at the same time
It’s nice to see that Marie Antoinette has been resurrected in time to celebrate her 230th anniversary of deat… Um, I mean… She was a stylish, beautiful queen 👸.
Bonjour! Here to tell you to leave Versailles ASAP
The Queen is back, literally
Low key a really sad historical figure.  Married off as a child, hated because she wasn't French, horribly out of touch to a point where any lie about her was believed, lost it all due to events out of her control and eventually beheaded while her children were still alive.  Damn.
This series is hilarious. More please!
Ditzy!
"Mops" is literally just "pug" in german lol
love these "correcting historical myths about women" types of videos 💕
I did a project about you in grade 5 I don't know why I thought you were dead
"Why is everyone obsessed with my head"😂
Ah yes, Karolina doing another iconic video, couldn't ask for better for the day! Thank you for your hard work💞
❤♥️❤♥️❤♥️❤♥️❤♥️❤♥️❤♥️❤♥️❤
The Victorian era XD nice one !!
I love this so much
So glad to see another! Glad I'm WFH today otherwise I'd be laughing quietly in the corner at work. I clicked so fast.
*Is Marie Antoinette* the proud owner of a really expensive diamond necklace...?
cool
Waiting for someone to think you're actually Marie Antionette.
1:13 Austro-Frankish rage intensifies
Wait. Is that why pug is a мопс? О.о
All everyone thinks about Marie Antoinette is her death. It’s quite sad.
“Yeah, but I didn’t say that” 😂
LOVE, your hairdooooo <3
Informative AND entertaining. CANNOT WAIT to correct the next fool that tries to use the cake quote haha.
omg I am so happy you did another one! Thank you Karolina
This is so bloody funny... I somehow feel less bad for her than I did for Marie Curie, though - at least everyone knows who she is haha.
😂 yay! This made my day love this haha!
Here early. Can't wait for the 1,000's of "I thought she was dead," "what is this," and "stop pretending to be someone you're not," comments to come when this goes viral. Lol.
I REALLY hope there will be enough ridiculous material in the comment section for you to make another reaction video coz the one that included comments about you as Marie Curie was just ✨splendid✨
omg the acting, the accent, she's really got it all folks. amazing queen
Waiting for the "how dare you portrait Maire Curie" crowd to find this XD
I love your videos 😻
This video series is amazing.
Thank you TIRED for another excellent episode!
The genuine confusion and disappointment with the fascination about her head's whereabouts is so palpable 😅
These are the best, Karolina! Thank you for making them and bringing attention to all the nonsense written about historical women. All of the lies and falsehoods are really just meant to make women seem weak and I love that you're correcting so many things they teach in school.
You can tell she *lost her head* over this stupid questions
obsessed with the powdered wig 👏
You are so fucking hilarious
In solidarity with the very strange people who commented on your last historical personality video....... I must say...... Wow I didn't know Marie Antoinette was still alive!  You're so fake you're not really Marie Antoinette.
today i rewatched Marie Antoinette by Coppola and this video is just the best closure for this day
Loved the dark humour, but I also loved how you tried to debunk the myths.
"Why is everyone so obsessed with my head?" Honestly, same
Love it ❤❤❤
i love marie antoinette sm and now my meme mum makes THIS. i am crying sobbing melting throwing up 😭
this is phenomenal 🤌🏻🤌🏻🤌🏻
We don't deserve you LMFAO!
Marie Antoinette slowly coming to the realization that her inaction was exactly the problem is the funniest thing I've seen all week.
Watching this made me genuinely feel so bad for Marie Antoinette, didn’t know _too_ too much about her before but now I feel sympathy for her lol
This is comedy gold 😂😂
The reaction to the death questions get me every time
OMG i thought there will be no second marie curie tired, answers web searched type of video 👏👏👏
QUEEN (literally)
love it
Her face whenever they talk about her death 😭
Aawww yisss! Hope this becomes a series
"Let 'em eat cake!"-Marie Antoinette fans, who liked her *cakes*, but got lost in historical translation
wow awesome!
*Sees Karolina as French Aristocrat* Now that's some cake
Marie Antoinette is my favorite problematic fave
The queen (karolina) back thank you so much  love your videos
Will we admire french version of this sketch with a Babel help for Karolina? Me: Light colour / blonde hair does not match with Karolina. Karolina: Hold my vine :)
It must have been quite frustrating to know all your predecessors could live in the excess without *that* happening to them, tho 😂
Marie Antoinette: "I don't understand." Perfect
Now I want to know what happened to your head!!  Also people still say your hair turned gray overnight, the night before you were... you know....and my thought is that they didn't let you tidy up much before the... you know. I think we have a LOT more questions for you.
Ok, so now I have to know what happened to Marie Antoinette's head.
i absolutely love this.  please do more of these kind of videos.
