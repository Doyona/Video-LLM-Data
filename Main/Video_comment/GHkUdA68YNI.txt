I just want Ryan to win once.   Once.
I AM POSSESSED BY DIABETES!
This episode and the one about the Dancing Plague helped me write a killer research paper on the Salem Witch Trials. My thesis was that the trials were an example of mass hysteria stemming from psychosomatic symptoms brought on by stress and trauma, and I cited Loudun and Strasbourg as other examples. Obviously I had to look up actual, peer-reviewed sources to make the connection because I couldn't just cite "McNasty, et al., 2021" but still, Puppet History gave me the idea and my professor loved it.
“sara rubin, my moon and stars” thats so sweet dude
Spike up the butt was a torture device, I believe? though with a different name 😂.
Man idk about whataburger but I remember trying in and out for the first time after hearing all they hype for years. Driest and most bland food I've ever tasted. If they could have made the drink dry, im sure they would have😂 im a big guy, I eat, but even I struggled to try find the drive to eat much of the food we got 😅
bro this is so cool. just watched it 2025 and I can't believe i'm missing everything 3 years ago by not watching this channel
I never know if Sara is just exactly the kind of woman I aspire to be or if I'm just a little bit in love with her
Everytime I see Sara I fall in love with her a little more her energy is everything ❤️
The demon Asmodius rips into an unpublished ELO B-side.
THE PROFESSOR!  NO!
Lice check? 🥢
Love all of puppet history
Bro it was probably ergot poisoning
God Damm I think I’d answer c every time
....I'm only watching this video to line more history.
i believe in 👻🏠 but not in 👻
Im rewatching all of puppet history because the latest ep had some truly indecipherable lore and rewatching this is truly just as good as the first watch
I've never felt more connected to a supernatural entity than I do to the demon known as "Dog's Dick"
never heard my name so much in one video before
why is this one so effing long?
Puppet History was my introduction to Watcher. Shane was the Professor and Ryan was the sitcom frienemy. I knew very little about Watcher outside of that. This episode was my first exposure to Shane, the 'Fight me, you stupid non-existent demon!' Madej. But I know more now. Hearing Sarah say "Demons don't exist," I thought 'yup, that sounds like a woman non-puppet Shane would vibe with.'
there's a VERY controversial horror movie about this whole thing!! The Devils and it had a scene so insane that it was cut from most available versions online (the scene is called the r*pe of Jesus). the movie itself is pretty good tho!! very strange and surreal and unsettling.
28:02
They should know about the plague LOL wasn't the first class on that?
With regards to the tongue thing, I am now picturing Lily Rose Depp's crash out in Nosferatu
34:06 i was expecting dogs diek
Man, the things you had to wait for to have some sort of entertainment back in the Early Modern period. Now I can open an app and see all sorts of people in various states of possession.
saras bit where she says each new entity that came in at the end was so funny
Ryan shitting on whataburger activated my fight or flight
Toxoplasmosis doesnt make you love your cat 😂😂 its a disease caught from parasites in cat feces that can make you super unwell Sarah 😂😂😂  I did fact check and apparently it can alter rodent behaviour, but it doesnt make make humans love cats
5:34 im just envisioning that one scene from the Janice Dickinson 12 days of christmas parody 😂😂 iykyk
They do the c dog bit on this episode btw <3
sara saying she would chill with the demons… shane you’re not beating the allegations…
Dammit, I knew there was a reason he was being so nice
Great Acting Loce it !!!!!:)
Spotify the ASMODEUS song please :)
34:20 ghost bc
4:36   SEPTEMBER 22ND? DAS MA BIFDA!
"This isn't one of those lazy shows that leaves things unsolved at the end"
I miss puppet history :(
Well that's Catholics for ya....
10:40 people sounded like Macho man Randy Savage back then?
Sara is an absolute delight.
Shane and Sara just got married last weekend, October 11, 2024 ❤❤
Ooh the ending line being an avengers ref
Imagine you're like one of the cooler Demons and you have to carpool with ole DD...
It's wild coming back to this 2 years later and seeing all of the foreshadowing. Like, it's not even subtle. And I LOVE it. Shane was waving this twist in our faces and we had NO IDEA
i fully thought that the professor said "cannabis" at 0:52
shane has such an entertaining narrating voice, he's a natural
I just watch the movie ‘The Devils’ (1971) last night and was like, wait a minute, Professor did an episode on this!   Btw, it’s a great movie.
cant believe they'd trash talk whataburger like that
Shane letting out a little "aww" at 13:45 with Sarah's response was very cute. That man is in love
18:28 I love the professors little “oop” right as the question appears 😂
Ryan’s demons were funnier
Ken Russell's "The Devils" is a movie about this incident starring Vanessa Redgrave and Oliver Reed.  It's rated X and considered one of the most controversial films ever made, though it's critically acclaimed. It's also impossible to find a copy of the full, uncensored director's cut, but you can find slightly edited versions out there.  I highly recommend watching! It's crazy!
Love that, knowing what was about to  ensue, Shane asks "ok, ready everybody?" at the beginning. When this first aired and I watched it I literally screamed lol
This is supposed to be scary, but I'm laughing..
22:42
I love that one of the demons was just named Alex, but Dog's Dick is a close second.
I’m thankful Sarah was there to commentate on everything otherwise I wouldn’t have know what was going on
I’m taking a class on Witchcraft and Heresy in medieval Europe and one of my sources in my book is the nun possessions of Loudun, so in order to familiarize myself I rewatched this <3 truly helping me get this degree, thanks guys
12:00  Asmodeus is the demon representative of one of the deadly sins: Lust.  Leviathan is the demon representative of another deadly sin: Envy
Wait so do Christian’s believe that witchcraft is real? Because possessions, exorcisms, miracles, resurrections, praying and blessings are literally magical witchcraft.
That songs kinda nice
That Asmodeus Tune Really slaps, it's been living rent free in my head for ages.
Shanes gf is sara? Hes got a baddie
Watching this after I watched all of helluva boss like... Asmodious. I know that name...
Sara: This was their rumschpringe!  Annotation: nun-sprige??  Lmaoooooo good joke
So does this mean that Ryan sold his soul?
aw yeah the sound of a dodgeball hitting someone is "PUNK!"
The music in the background of the trial made it seem like scene from the Phoenix wright👨‍⚖️🗯️📜
That Dracula impression - * ITALLIAN CHEFS'S KISS
Sara has a demon living in her shaggy Fro downstairs! That Beast needs to eat!! 😳😬😘😂
ya....she def has cats
That song is fucking amazing
why is no one talking about the professors photo being from wiki feet
The crazy thing about religious people, is that they are no less delusional, irrational, or illogical now than they were back then......
Why was my first reaction to “she claimed to be possessed by seven demons” saying “hot” 🤦
33:34 holy shit I am crying laughing 😂 “fuck” …. “Oh”….
I refuse to believe unintentional or not that Ryan made a doctor sleep reference
The only problem I have with this is at 10:00 when sane says Scotland & England & proceed to put a Scotland & british flag, Scotland literally represent the blue in the union jack!
You mean a pandemic causes societal trauma? Sounds fake.
Did anyone else have their headphones tune into a weird alien transmission?
Guess where William Peter Blatty got the idea for Father Karras asking Pazuzu to come into him?
Wait. Will there be no more Puppet History?…..like ever?!!!….Puppet History, Ghost Files, and games with the Ghoul Boys are what help me through my days……😢
Poor Grandier, he didn't deserve to die like that!
❤
He became what he loved... history.
Ryan should've written Ricky Goldsworth
Sara's reactions in this one get me every time. I also love that the genie straight up just looks like Shayne but greasy
Bruh I would be ARF ARF ARF, BARKING when it came to a sea-dogs bit
the professor, a time traveling puppet whose got beef with a genie, had met god, death, and the devil, draws the line at ghosts LMAO
I thought this was gonna be about Loudoun County. Sad.  The demons possessing me are Cherenix the Mistress of Anxiety and Indecisiveness, Ravanal the Lord of Compulsion, Vennrir the Prince of Isolation, and Beelzebub the Avatar of Gluttony.
if i had a nickel for every interpretation of osmodius doing a musical on youtube i’ve seen i’d have two nickels
been binging these nonstop for the past 2ish days and I had to actually remind myself that The Professor is a puppet on the hand of Shane Madej.
That music that plays while the professor is getting eaten sure is familiar to me now.
truly an amazing multi talented man, so continually impressed by this old gentleman soul❤ kudos to you good sir
Re watching and hearing Ryan ask, "Who was that first demon again? Professor: "Asmodeus."     Love these little devious lore cookies left for us rewatching Puppet History. Good job boys. 11:40
yo why is there an apostrophe in Dog's Dick , cos unless u dont like dogs and 'Dog is Dick' then i dont understand 😂
Ok but that Asmodeus puppet is impressive
19:55 Everyone knows that contracts issued for selling souls to demons are signed on NCR paper—or maybe it’s ICR paper (infernal cash register instead of national cash register).  The original goes to Satan’s filing cabinet, the the first copy is kept by the demon who made the sale, and the second copy is kept by the human who sold their soul.
This was actually my second ever Puppet History episode watched, right after the Olga of Kiev ep. Let me tell you, when I watched this the first time and saw the Professor get zapped into oblivion with no context, I was a bit confused 😅😅
A demon named Lebron James. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 God, I love Ryan.
I was doing research for an unrelated Thing when I was reminded that an alternate name for Asmodeus is Asmoday.  As... Moday...  S... Madej...  This demon seriously wrote himself a whole ass bop of a theme song.
So this is where Ryan and Shane ended up, huh?
Ok but the Asmodeus song...Incredible. So creative. I cant believe the production quality.
HOW WAS THIS TWO YEARS AGO.
Only today do I hear the backing count in the song, "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6"
Waaiiiiittt he is ACTUALLY DEAD???
how dare you say whataburger is bad
My favorite song from any episode of Puppet History to date.
8:45 ooh, nice to know this was on my birthday!
6:40 EEY IM DRINKIN BLOOD OVA HERE!!
5:22 * THE SKELETON APPEARS *
5:45 the idea of one of the lords of hell being bored as fuck and just wanting to prank this one nunnery in france with making them see spirits and getting hit by ghostly black dodge balls is hillarious, you know, i imagine that they even made the like, rubber kick ball noise just a repeated echoey sound of * thunk...thunk thunk THUNK THUNK * is amazing!
This was weird as the first episode I ever watched
is it just me or is genie!Shane kinda...
This sounds like a very bad trip
shane is so demon coded
I also find it Hilarious that a watermarked photo of the Prof from wiki feet was used instead of, you know, their own photos…
*very calmly* what the fuck
i would have got all these right because i seen the 1971 film The Devils which was based on these events
Lots of reports of orbs before the plague, all I'm saying
im sorry but i have to unsubscribe due to the Whataburger slander
There’s nothing I love more than seeing a man pursue his history based, vaguely traumatizing puppet show dreams while supported by his reluctant best friend and smarty pants girlfriend
What a season finale......!!!!!!
It’s been almost two years and *”POSSESS ME DADDY”* still lives rent free in my mind 😂
Did anyone else realise that the demon name concupiscence is the alias the "professor" used to buy a certain thing from ebay in the Robert Lisbon episode?
Dream blunt rotation includes Sara Rubin
34:16- i sure do love electric light orchestra
No wonder Dante's Inferno have so many clergy men and women in hell. Serves the bad people right for falsely accusing and torturing the guy.
atheists say god alot 😂
I think because generally, life was bleak, it was difficult to find enjoyment from very little things. So in a way this served as a sort of theater for them to watch events ensue. This could have provided them entertainment and being in-the-know was sort of a fad.
Shane is the wittiest person I’ve ever seen haha
The professor calling Sarah “my moon and stars” my heart! ❤
the one time i can show my little knowledge. Ursuline is pronounces as “urs-i-lin”. my highschool is Ursuline based and is the only way i know how to pronounce it
shanes gonna be pissed when he finds out a puppet is trying to steal his woman
i need sara and shane to make a cat parent chanel for my mental health
Wow Shane is just so comfortable with their relationship because the professor has been just putting on straight MOVES on Sara!
Love the song and dance so cool
This is so funny I love it
My demons are Crystal Farcast the imp and Artemis of the Ars Goetia -Helluva Boss lover
Im pretty sure "all the women just wanna kiss that hot guy, lets kill him" was the number 1 cause for murder back in those days
Ryan and Shane u guys need 2 pass that shit ur smoking 🚬 lmmfao
Ryan! How could you?!
🇵🇬🇵🇬
I love the idea that she stick and poked the names on her hand I don't know why but it's so funny to me
all the main people who got Grandier killed die shortly after... maybe bro was up to some sorcery after all
Okay I watched season 5 before I watched season 4 it’s was almost like watching endgame before infinity war 😮
I feel about White Castle how Ryan feels about Whataburger 😂😂
i loved buzz feed unsolved and the watcher ghost files but this puppet thing is just silly really - dont like it
Oh my God, this was ACTUALLY his Joker arc--
Asmodeus, and Leviathan(the actual spelling) are two of the prince's of hell. And each prince of hell controls a ring of hell. Each prince represents one of the seven sins. Seven princes, seven rings of hell, seven deadly sins.
You know you can mock this all you want but you may be actually making fun of mentally ill people
Demons are real and are the untapped portions of the human mind🧐
Fucking "ALEX" I'm dead. That got me more than 'dog's dick' did
imagine how many kids cried over this
Ryan: Worth it
The C Dogs bit is the actual best part of the show. Every time they have that bit, I lose my shit. 10/10. Always puts a smile on my face.
It’s like most witch trials where they just use it as an excuse to settle old scores.
Bro wtf this is so meta
the first time i watched this (then the next 10 trillion times), i didnt even notice the hand from not-Shane as he threw the trophy at Ryan... well performed!
28:01  "Possess me, Daddy!" 🤣
13:17 if he had said Ricky Goldsworth I would have given him bonus points.
Well ain't they just a couple of wet blanket atheists. LOL. With all the strange things Shane's seen ud think their might be a chance that he does believe that they might be real.
Did she just say rummspringa? hahahaha. Like they're Amish? Wow she's American af. Lol whenever i hear someone remember what rummspringa is (cus I never remember it exists till.someone else says it) I worry they had to had to escape the communities. Lol. Fkn weirdos lol.   Lol hot priest.
Short people are so.close to.their toes how can they not reach them. Lol
I believe Uriel is the name of one of the angels.
As a vet tech I can say that toxoplasmosis has shown no evidence of having a cat loving affect on humans. And Sara downplayed it majorly.
“and because this isn’t one of those lazy shows that leaves things unsolved at the end" 💀💀💀💀💀
October 5th is my birthday
28:02 made me spit out my juice
I love Sara’s facial expression at 24:16
7:30 oh shes vogueing the nunnery downnnnnn
♥️♥️♥️
28:02 I never thought I'd need a 𝕻𝖔𝖘𝖘𝖊𝖘𝖘 𝖒𝖊, 𝕯𝖆𝖉𝖉𝖞 in my life but here I am.
Asmodus....hmm WAIT
This incident is the basis for The Devils, a film so controversial, it still doesn't have a full uncut release after 50 years.
This is fun... and Sarah is easy on the eyes.
"Possess me daddy "😂😂😂😂
Needles are demons🤣 Edit: I win money on Ryan never winning
Sara should have said toxoplasmodeus
ThTs Shane’s girlfriend? ….. dang I was wishing he would stay single until I had a chance to meet and properly woo him but uh- yeah good on ya Sarah… Cool 😞
The fuck did I just watch?!?!??!  Professor Noooooooooo
NOOOOOO PROFESSOR
Part of me was truly hoping that when Ryan finally got the jelly beans, they were the kind from the mystery game where you can get flavors like dirty socks. I've played and you can't fake the reaction. 🤤😒🤢😄
Is there a playlist of just the songs XD
I WILL NOT TOLERATE THIS WHATABURGER SLANDER
"sure" "Is that what this is about?" "No"
"Nothing more holy than fisticuffs baby." The doom slayer thinks Ryan deserves 300 beans for that shit.
Best puppet history song
12:35 I'll tell ya what demon I'm possessed by: Hommes blancs dégoûtants
I love how there's a puppet history effectively about a nun orgy cus they had the hots for the local priest
I wonder how many demon possessions and stories like this from the past were because someone ate a weird plant
To think that shane is to blame for the demons in Ryan because he always invite them to take over Ryan every time they go to a haunted house
Aldous  Huxley brought here
can we talk about how the production value practically doubled between seasons 4 and 5?!??
The first college that I went to was founded by Ursuline nuns. Funny, they never mentioned this story 🤔
Will we get a episode about Spinalonga?
im not afraid to say it:  puppet history did it better than marvel
7:01 bisexual lighting ayyy
I really wanna know what Ryan and the special guest see. Ever since Ryan pointed out in the dancing plague episode that all the effects are added in later, I’ve been wondering about what actually is going on. Do they hear the background music for the songs? What do they see when the Jelly Telly shows up? I don’t need sleep I need answers
Wherever Shane is he needs to be careful or the professor is gonna steel his girl
I just now found out that Sara is Shane’s gf and I already didn’t like her 😅
i can't help but wonder how Asmodeus from Obey Me would react to that song (edit: ... all of it) ... whether he would hate it or love it, i am unsure aksjdhgkjsag
THATS HOW THE PROFESSOR DIED????????? 😭😭😭😭
frankly its a shame that the ending overshadows what a goddamn good song asmodeus sings. absolute banger, one of the best of the show.
Shane
I love Ryan Burger
i had to come and finish this season before i watched the latest eps so i could avoid spoilers on the professor's lore lmao at first it was just a fun bit but now it really makes this show feel a lot like a fun educational adventure program in its own unique and goofy way, i unironically love it and cant wait to binge the new season now!
We always joke about Shane being a demon, but I’m starting to think Ryan’s been one all along.
Why no b boys this episode???? They both chose B a few times!
Heck your Whataburger comment Ryan. Love you.
"POSSESS ME, DADDY!!" omgggg I'm crying!
Why do I keep watching this channel and how did it show up in my algorithm?
BRING BACK HOT DOGGA 🪧
That’s not Endland’s flag lol 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
7:34 nun-drecas
The spectacle of the Professor saying "Possess me, Daddy!" in a deep and malevolent voice will make me laugh for the rest of my life.
That poor fucking guy. Maybe he was an asshole, but he didn't deserve that.
Fuck the amount of forethought going into this show. Ryan reacting to the name Asmodeus when the professor lists off the demon names, the laugh when asked if he has him in his contacts, the look on his face during the song. It is impossible to tell which bits are rehearsed and planned and which aren't until the plot lets you know
"Sara Rubin, my moon and stars" 🥺❤  Also I love Sara trying to cover up for Shane being a demon but still saying that she'd hang out with him :P
33:59  “YOU SINGING LOVE SONG SONGS IN LUSTFUL LOUNGE?? OZZIE’S AINT THE PLACE FOR SENTIMENTAL SOUNDS!!”
c h o m p
Headbanging nuns
I hate it when people are like “I don’t believe in ghost because I’ve never seen them myself” Df. Stfu you stupid
Seems like the real back story to The Nun from The Conjuring universe
It's sad to see how much fun Ryan and the professor were having at the start of this episode, having come back from the latest season where Ryan seems so miserable
Nice, I guessed the demon right
HOLY SHIT HE'S *DEAD*
his first ever win
31:56 did professor just dissed buzzfeed unsolved?
Deceased Priest sounds like a metal band 😂🤣😂
"Ryan looks like he's communing with demons as he writes this." "That's true, I am." Watching this episode multiple times and taking note of all the clues is fun
anyone know the chords to asmodeus ? love the song so much
I know this was a year ago, but it is so hilarious how this actually turned into The Hot Daga vibes forreal this time
tf?
The fact that Professor "time traveling anthropomorphic puppet who gained power from a genie to accidentally create puppets out of inanimate objects and also is pals with literal god" McNasty doesn't believe in ghosts. Is. There's something there
Sara is so cuteee
How has no one commented saying how Sarah is sitting there looking all accomplicey to Ryan. Like she said she'd hang with demons and when she saw one, and when the devil showed up, she knew right away.... Somethings afoot
back again after today's new episode bc this song is just such a banger
So beyond the obvious, can we talk about how the genie apparently zapped all the puppets at the party into IRL versions of themselves? That's a real propeller, snowman and wolf behind him!  Also the fact that Olga's funeral party ambush and today's episode's possessions were choice thematic foreshadowing. This show is so fun and clever, please get better Professor ❤️
So, the professor doesn't believe in ghosts, but also found and made a deal with a genie? Weird mythology.
Shane’s genie makeup is absolutely perfect 😂
Come on make room for a little bit of hell in your heart <3
Imagine living in a time where someone can accuse you of sorcery and mother fuckers actually BELIEVE them.
there is no couple better matched than Shane and Sara oil
Holy sh)t that was great!
Coming back to watch this after the start of new season is. Interesting
It's become like 90% Just Ryan and Sarah as guests but that's alright because YOU ALL ROCK
one side effect of marathoning puppet history is that hot daga songs get stuck in my head for… some… reason
Just a side note, the fact that the Professor KNOWS genies are real, but doesn't believe in ghosts is hilarious.
what the fuck
This was the very first episode of puppet history I ever watched… I’m sure you can imagine how confused I was 😂
We need to appreciate more the top tier music being produced in this series 🎉🎉
If I had a nickel for every time a popular YouTube show made a song about the demon Asmodeus I would have...two nickels.
This was the first episode I've seen and, well...  I'm hooked now lol
When I heard people saying that the professor died in this episode, I was really expecting Ryan to strangle him or sometjing
If I had a nickel for every time I’ve watched a Demon named Asmodeus sing a song in a YouTube video I’d have two nickels. Which isn’t a lot but it’s weird that it happened twice.
My priest is an exorcist and he expelled leviathan from this one lady...
I too, like Sara, am possessed by love for Michael Stuhlbarg
the asmodeus song sounds like a panic! at the disco song or idk
I really really want the dinosaur that ate him to become immortal and absorb his essence so in the next season it's a dinosaur puppet in the professors clothing
YOU SLANDER THE WHATABURGER NAME RYAN.
you can’t tell me they weren’t all getting “action” from this. and money from the shows. no WAY!
The asmodeus song really is s bop tho
My balls hurt
Welp, time to start practicing necromancy!
is no one gonna talk about 31:55 when shane says “and because this isn’t one of those lazy shows that leaves things unsolved at the end..” 💀 loving the buzz feed unsolved shade
It's not 'welcome to France!', but 'welcome to Catholic Church!'
Not my moon and stars :,) I’m crying
Goddamn it Ryan! I finally accepted that y'all were moving on to other ventures and came over to this channel, found a show I absolutely adore w the cutest puppet since Elmo and you set him up! I love the Professor and I'm so sad now 😭😭😭 now I'm going to the ghost hunts just to watch Shane laugh at your paranoid ass 😂😂😂😂😂  All seriousness, congrats to you guys for the success of Watcher (Btw the name comes from the BU Episode about The Watcher, doesn't it? 👀) Y'all are literally my favorite content creators and I love the growth and expansion. Keep up the bangers! 😎🙌🔥💯
Not sure if she was just joking or if she actually thinks that toxoplasmosis is a condition where you really love your cat😂
Ryans acting this season was top notch
I may have to remake that Asmodeus song. Amazing! Bravo! Bravo!
Oo Sarah's tasty huh😂
RIP professor 🪦
YO WAIT ryan didn't mean to kill the professor?! i already knew he was gonna die ( :( ) but everyone made it sound like it was what ryan intended!! he had regret! he wanted to know if he was gonna be okay!!
NOOOOO! How could you Ryan? (sobs)
Mass psychosis
To the 666 ppl that dislike this: Nice.
I thought he said 7 demons not 24
the devils!!!
Wow, getting tied to a chair, freaking out, eventually calming down, and saying what the people having you tied to the chair want you to say doesn't sound so much like possession as..... a natural fear response of fighting followed by a natural fear response of submitting. Like that wasn't possession by demons that was abuse by the church.
This is amazing lol
She's a vibe
Ok I didn’t know there was a song this shit go hard
The clown makeup on Ryan at the end was perfection. Amazing.
BRING HIM BACK
please bring this show back, ive been rewatching the same ones over and over 😥i miss you PROFESSOR!!!
I'll be the one to say it: the genie was right. Professor was fucking with time.
tell me why THIS comment section is the way i finally got to know that this sara is SHANE'S sara 😭😭 nobody told me, y'all!!
Ryan forgot Ricky Goldsworth on his demons list!
I think Sarah is having an affair with the Professor. Someone should tell Shane...
“as far as england and scotland” *shows a scottish flag and a union flag, which also has the scottish flag in it*
Why is no one mentioning how good the song was super catchy
I hope Ryan puts Shane’s name down as a demon
Happy 1 year anniversary, Professor!!
On a serious note: Does someone know if Shane is planning on continuing Puppet History? I just discovered the show and absolutely fell in love. EDIT: Just found the announcement for the next season :)
Wow, can't believe it's been almost a whole year since the Professor was so cruelly taken from us. 💔
Sarah’s got some issues I think….
OMG BUT THE SONG AT THE END THO
"This isnt one of those lazy shows that leaves things unsolved at the end"  Oh shit
Shane is now in his real form
For just a second I though it would be Ozzie's song from helluva boss
You know what. Screw Ryan. I said it. Such a butthole for doing that to the professor
It would be funny if during the demon names bit, Ryan rolled his eyes back like he's "possessed" speak some made up gutteral gobbledegook and then just wrote a bunch of squiggles, and triumphantly claiming that it is the True Name of the demon. But played like, super serious.
Did not expect to see that hand from the thumbnail so soon. Just did an art project with that as one of my references
It would be amazing if Puppet History did a “chapter” from South Asian history (Nepal, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, or Sri Lanka). The Partition would be a pretty interesting one!
This might be fake, but I heard the Nun Jean had a disfigured back and was addicted to attention.
Wait...?.....ALEX??!!! I don't remember possessing anyone in that time!
Lol Ryan what about Ricky Goldsworth
I think Steven lim would have been a better guest for this episode, that way it would feel like we came full circle
I just realized, the Watermarks on the "RIP The Professor" Picture is the watermarks of WikiFeet and that's fucking hilarious
Wait I just watched this and he hates whataburger! I can’t believe it!
Can't believe it's almost a year since we've lost the professor.... Shane does look incredible in eyeshadow tho
love how Ryan says two accounts are substantial in ghost hunting specifically when it turns out the nuns were lying  and it wouldn't be substantial in literally any other science 😂
That song was amazing!!!!!!
"Where did the plague go?" "It came in waves...."  ....sounds familiar.
NOOOOO PROFESSORRRRRRR
Jkjkjkjkjkjkjkloved it
Now that sara has mocked my belief I'll most likely be ending my life cause my life long values are devalued and ridiculed and now I have nothing to hold close to my soul any longer thank u Sara
Asmodeus prince of hell
Is it just me ? Or does anyone else keep getting Ricky Goldsworth vibes from Ryan recently on this show?
This Catholic believes it was a crazy case( and please forgive me) of...mass hysteria!!!🙏🤔 Btw am I the only one who has noticed how much weird paranormal stuff happened in old timey France!!!😵‍💫
so I know the professor is technically canonically dead but the lore of this show is created by the same man that created the hot daga (and we know how wild that was) so in one way or another the professor will definitely be back
It would have been funny if Ryan said he was possessed by Rïçky Gøldswörth
Conan should be a guest.
Ok but can we all agree that Asmodeus has a banger of a song?
Honestly doesn’t make sense that the professor dies there as the T. rex would have had to chew him up which the T. rex didn’t meaning the professor is prob going to come back… maybe
Missed opportunity to say Ricky Goldsworth as an answer 💀
When Shane said Asmodeus was going to sing a song I fully thought he was going to burst into the 'House of Asmodeus' song from Helluva Boss
Hey... wonder what that weird box was from the pirate queen episode? it was dated to be secured until like 2052 or something... maybe theres a lead for us, maybe the professor didn't die?
Ryan missed an opportunity to say Ricky goldsworth when he was asked what demons possessed him
France has been a hot mess for centuries! all of the beasts in the different provinces; the shoddy ruling class; these possessions; the dancing plague..  yikes
I just realized they used a watermark photo for the prof, which honestly makes it even funnier
Is no one going to talk about how much of a bop Asmodus' song was?
Please I need a musical about asmodeus
Welp cant wait for the professor to get canonically revived!
This is Gold, waiting for the next season
got some good bread- sarah-2022
I love the little "Posphorus f*cked here" on the chalk board at 12:00!! :D Nice nod to the graffitis of Pompeii, which were featured on the "Terrifying Eruption of Mt. Vesuvius" Episode! Also, as a European, I completely love this show for getting european history quite right. That's seldom for Americans. No mean to offend, lol
That's a Genie! 38:16
My god. A story within a Story. What will happen Next?
Everyone’s talking about the LORE but no one’s talking about how funny Sara’s little munches are whenever she gets a jellybean? She’s awesome omg 😂😂💗
finished my bingewatch of Puppet History before S5, cant wait!
Who requested no lore? Cause this is what happens when you request no lore!! 😭😭😭😭
Y'all should do the New York to Paris car race in 1907 next season (I think it happened in 1907, been a minute since I found out about it). The whole thing was so damn hilarious, plus it had long lasting ramifications. Won't get into it due to spoilers, but I think y'all would have a blast with it.
OMG Ryan is like Judas! He betrayed the Professor for a mini trophy!
Come back :'(
"Since this isn't one of those lazy shows that leaves things Unsolved at the end..."
Lmao I'm so glad Shane didn't listen to the people who hated the lore.
21:35 36:40
17:29 me as a demon
The Asmodeus song is catchy asf
Is puppet history over? Or we gonna get more seasons?
It only took me 3 minutes to realize Sara is funny and I like her attitude lol
Fun fact: There's a movie made based off of this event called "The Devils", made in 1971 by Ken Russel. It was super controversial because "oh no church slander" and "its the seventies no movie thats freaky". There was this whole crusade to remove it. It didn’t work but parts of the movie were in fact destroyed.
Nooooooo sadness I miss puppet history
After years of searching, I find the fabled cave. "Finally..." I whisper to no one as I lift the lamp from its golden pedestal. Solemnly, I trace the intricate patterns with the pad of my thumb, and the wretched creature appears in a cloud of hazy purple smoke. I inhale deep. It's Crazy Grape Vape juice. It speaks hoarsely, "You've Found Me. Congratulations. Now Make Your Wish." I contemplate. And eventually I speak, "I wish that when Asmodius possessed the professor he (the demon) had wished for you (the genie) to forget about the deal you made with the professor in the first place!" The world itself seems to shake with the impact of this paradox, but the genie's magic is unparalleled. It mumbles what I can only assume are curses from the deepest depths of hell as it scowls. "... Your Wish Is My Command..."  The deafening snap of his fingers, and through a massive cloud of Grape Vape, the professor poofs back into existence! Having never been sent back to dinosaur times. His satchel still filled with fresh jelly beans and a time portal. And the genie quietly returns to his oblivious slumber, having no memory of the little fury fiend at all.
when is the puppet history album dropping...?
I swear if they do the whole thing where they bring in the professor’s “twin brother” I’m gonna snap!
Will there be another season?
Whataburger is trash! In-N-Out forever!
It's so nice of Shane to let Sara third wheel on these dates with Ryan
As an Obey Me! player I feel like Asmo would actually like that song
2:00 HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM_MMMMMMMMMMMMMMM*MMMMMMMMMMMMM.*_ Maybe certain fucknuggets should try wearing damn masks for like two weeks longer than they initially when they're in public and we would have been done with this shit a few months ago. Anyway, that out of the way, I fucking loved this one. And even though Ryan may be a bit less empirical than me, I can still appreciate his Dib-like attitude toward possibilities of the... less confirmed sort, shall we say.
I’m still not convinced that brave, boneless blue champion of historical recaps if really gone. His lack of bones and lack of muscles and lack of sentience have all been overcome by the professor’s iron clad will to give a play by play of this heavy heavy book called history
I like all the parts in the Asmodeus song where we cut to Ryan looking slightly disturbed because he knows that guy is going inside the professor
That's pretty was damn amazing !!! 💯
I cannot stress this enough: the songs are so excellent!!!!!!!!!
I’d buy a nun pet dispenser
rewatching this episode (and season tbh) it is absolutely DRIPPING in foreshadowing to Ryan's betrayal
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
It’s aa mee, Draculaa
28:02
That genie best use his powers to zap the professor back to life or I'm going to be mildly peeved.
They really put joker makeup on Ryan during that fadeout huh
9:52 Reminds me of the situation where the people danced till they died: public stages, community involvement, etc.
Um. What the fuck 🤣
For the love of god does anyone know the name of those New Balance?
Top 10 betrayals of all time
i think there should be an episode where The Professor wins
What the hell does Canonicaly means!!??? Im sobbing i cant think!!!!!
nah; that trex didnt chew!  he's reinacting pinocchio in that dino's stomach
Nooooooooo!!! Please bring him back!!!!
It is the season 4 finale, and after counting the real points in the other videos, it's finally time to finish it. As usual, this will be focused on the points won during the questions only, not the extra points the professor gives out willy-nilly.  Actual Score: Ryan had 3 points and Sara had 4. You may have gotten that trophy, Ryan, but the Beef Boy still lost in the end. But the real lose is to all of us for losing our beloved professor. RIP buddy ❤
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 academy award 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🏆
This being the first episode of puppet history that I watched, I’m not sure how to feel
:// so no lazy river?
The hood lost a real one today 💔
So sad to see this go, it's one of my favorite youtube series, and it feels like it could go on so much longer!
there's a demon named dogsdick? that's based.
Now the horsey in hell saying don’t trust Ryan bergara makes total sense
oh shit death by T-rex? :'( RIP Professor... please revive soon
He is fine. That happened to my buddy Eric once and he just walked it off. We need Season 6, Puppet PRE-HISTORY
All of these people are clearly lying for attention. Oh wait, this is the same story The Devils (1971) is based off of. I need to find that movie. It looks hilarious!
As a Austinite, I will address the Whataburger possession. Now, I'm going to disagree and say that anyone would be lucky to have the experience of Whataburger possession. Whataburger is the leader of all other possessions. Yeah, that's all I got.
The Professor better come back! 😢😭
15:43 -15:55 wholesome
7:05 - 7:39 LMFAOOOOO
just noticed that while the professor was eaten (rip) his satchel was not... begging for it to still have time travel abilities and for there to be some time travel shenanagins that brings the professor back <3 pls i miss him
See, this is weird, because in the Malleus Maleficarum (witch-hunting handbook from the 17th century) it says that witches' marks (weird birthmarks or moles or whatever) were actually NUMB and you could poke them with a needle and NOT make a person scream?
When will Season 5 be coming out?
Just bring this series back I love learning this way... I keep binging the episodes and after a while you memories stuff haha a new season would be awesome
NOO DON'T END LIKE THIS!! 😭😭😭
7:10
What!? Whataburger is the best! Although, I do tend to get the chicken, there aren't a lot of places you can get that much food for a better price. So there!
Sarah is more annoying than funny.
I think y’all should do a puppet history with safiya!!! Y’all seem to have an ex BuzzFeed theme to some of these videos and so she seems the perfect candidate(she kinda started the leaving BuzzFeed movement lol?
Considering they used to make cake with pee and feed it to a dog and if you felt pain while the dog ate it meant you were a witch, bot surprised they’d think sticking needles in balls and feeling pain meant you made a deal with the devil.
Damn ppl were dumb back then
Professor giving Ryan his last jelly bean for asking nicely and sticking though the algorithm no matter how aggrivating it got for him. wish it had ended there honestly, or that there was any real remorse from ryan about it, like real grief for his friend.
I love professor
Ok but Shane’s song actually had me vibing so hard
Am I the only one who was straight up just vibing to the song? Professor; may I please get a full version? I LIVE for the musical numbers at the end of these; but I think this is the best one yet. Bravo.
you might call this episode, uh.... ruining puppet history
professor, your shane madej is showing.
We are forever in debt less we forget now lie in Flanders Fields Professor.
Can’t believe I can watch this for free!!!
Foreshadowing throughout the whole episode.  "Possess me, Daddy!" needs to be a ringtone. 28:02
So shane didnt get possessed by demons because he was a genie?
Jesus...
I think they made a movie about this called The Devils.
is season 5 just going to be ryan and guests answering questions through time to rescue the professor :0
Sarah: what did it cost? Ryan: everything  Ryan having flashbacks of when he made the deal with the demon: 🎶 I feel it coming out my throat guess I better wash my mouth with soap 🎶
This wasn't a possession, this was source engine bugging out
That’s a genie. That’s a demon. Now That’s the devil.
YO DID THE PROFESSOR YELL “BEEF BOY” AS HE WAS FALLING THRU THE PORTAL OR WAS THAT JUST ME
Damn I’m glad I didn’t open the comments before I finished the video
*whispers* the lore. Guys...the lore.  *Shouts* the looooooooooooooooooore!
7:50 okay but how the shit did they know it was hard? Did some motherfucker just take the shot and french kiss a demon lady???
I love you guys but you are not showing enough, or ANY, respect for these beings. You need to be careful.
Not Ryan doing a Thanos ending lmaooo. Rip the Professor
@ 14.16 "wow, you guys really got the hang of this. see, it's so easy to be possessed."   i think we underplayed or don't give enough acknowledgement to shane and how he single handedly destroyed the entire concept that demons/ghosts exist,  possessions and whatever with just that one simple "exorcise" / test. he didn't have to "prove" that demons didn't exist - he merely had everyone list out a series of fictitious mumblings that they thought were real and voila. you are "possessed".   pure brilliance.
I'm surprised that Ryan didn't write down Sally as one of his demons.
Rest in Peace🌋🌋🌋
No!!!
*crying my fucking eyes out right now*
There was no need for the Asmodeus song to be so good but I'm so glad it was
The professor: name some demons  Me : this is a demon from Japanese folklore Shuten Doji
Bro Ryan dident talk about his buzzfeed supernatrual show that sadly ended :(
You guys don't think he's gone right?!
WHEN I TELL YOU SHANE IS THE SECOND COMING OF ONE JIM HENSON AND WE ARE NOT WORTHY 😩
was expecting Ryan to say "Ricky Goldsworth" when asked what demons were possessing him 😔
never seen this channel but i know Shane and Ryan from BuzzFeed unsolved and the puppet is obviously Shane and that is hysterical
Ryan didn't listet Ricky Goldsworth As his demon!!
Best season finale of all time
God, these are making me want jelly beans so bad hahaha
I'm in denial.
Ryan saves the professor from the genie that is after him
i didnt know that sara was shanes wifeee thats so cuteee
bro shane is producing bangers that go SO hard
Me, holding onto the fact that they kept saying SEASON finale and not SERIES finale 🥲
If this is the end of puppet history then I’m sad 😭. I really enjoyed puppet history.
ryan wasnt even possesed or anything 💀💀 he just wanted the trophy like what 💀💀
Damn nobody talking about Shane saying “okay, ready everybody?” At the beginning because they forgot to cut that part of the audio file.
Perhaps Shane got bored with this series? Which is understandable. It’s fine. Better things are to come:)
No...No...NO! Whoever replaces the professor must be pretty freaking great! He left a high standard.
bye bye professor
Wait?! Wait?! So does the devil puppet is now the host of the show?! Will the professor come back?! Will we see the professor again?! Will the next episode be the devil vs the professor??!! I need answers!!!
Ryan forgot about Ricky Goldsworth, when they were naming off the demons inside of him. Unless he doesn't know Ricky's inside of him
did anyone else notice the clown makeup appearing on ryans face while it flashed to the devil?
I think you should talk about the conjuring houses history or history of Ed and louran
I honestly love the Devil puppet lol.
Pez dispensers 😂🤣🤣🤣
Why do I feel something going on between sara and Ryan pretty wild episode i hope not because Ryan’s ass and Shane’s way better for her
As a fan of LPOTL I was so happy that puppet history also did an episode on it.
I never noticed when i first watched this but a lot of those "demon" names are just generic bible names, like leviathan, nephilin and behemoth are just names of creatures in the bible
Asmodeus needs to be on Spotify
PROFESSOR 😭nooooooooo
I-... I just can't-... I need to know that it was all a lie and the professor is still alive...
13:18 that is not a demon it is an event in mythology Ryan
This is a masterpiece.
For a bit I thought they weren’t going to mention all the weird sexy vibes between Grandier and the nuns, glad we’ve found our way back.
This fandom and channel are so fucking chaotic and I love it
40:43
We better get another season
Man, I can’t believe this is the second time I’ve seen a asmodeus musical number this year. (helluva boss in case anyone was curious)
Ryan, I always love you... but you dissed Whataburger and I'm not sure if I can get over that man. I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt that a demon made you say that 😈
WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED IN THIS EPISODE
I was cackling at the end, I thrive off of chaos.
The Professor is gonna come back, right? Haha…
I knew it was coming should have given him a win professor 😆
Wow what a twist 😳
*sees Asmodeus* Hmm, he sang better in Helluva Boss
That really was incredible!
Can't wait to watch Ryan fist fight a Velociraptor over the Professor next season. Oh. He just died. Well fuck.
Not the wikifeet watermark 😭 rest in peace professor
But for real, puppet history is coming back right??
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
The best thing I've ever watched
“This isn’t some lazy show that leaves things unsolved at the end.”  Shots fired, McNasty-Style 🤣🤣
Me who watches this video : **exists** Me in my Talim costume and laying in bed and being scared af : 💧👁👄👁💧
I hope the Professor gets rescued and everyone is all right
NOOOOOOOOO
I will never forget the way my friend texted me in a panic the day this episode came out about how the professor was dead
"Twister is hard." "My foot fell asleep." Hard hitting commentary from Ryan, as always.
So, canonically dead means The Professor’s journey isn’t over yet?!?
Lol imagine what this video must have been like for someone who hasn't watched the series, just dipped in randomly or only seen a couple eps with no lore. What a fucking end to a youtube history video
Shane:  Hey demon, its ya boi.
AAAAAAAAAAAA you can bring him back right!? Watcher we know it is hard work but we need you to, think about the publicity of the professor coming back!
THE ONLY TEACHER I ACTUALLY LISTEN TO AND LIKE!!!!! Rip to the best
I love how it is never OVERTLY stated what happened with The Professor and The Genie, but you can piece it together based on the hints dropped throughout the series.
i named my snake Asmodeus and i am absolutely co-opting that song as his theme song.
Like seriously… dog dick. DOG DICK someone died over a demon named DOG DICK
Watcher. We still have so much more to learn from the professor. Please please PLEASE bring him back. We need puppet history
ricky did say he was going to replace ryan....its starting
Ryan finally won, but at what cost
Poor professor, he didn’t even get to die in a lazy river like he wanted :(
Why is the song such a god damn banger???
No this can’t be the end
The Professor: *mentions the Ursuline convent at **2:20* Me: *Has flashbacks from going to an Ursuline high school* (Nothing bad, I just enjoyed making that connection. I heard NONE of this info, for obvious reasons) NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! RIP Professor!
Please tell me this is setting up an animated series where Ryan goes to save the professor
Sara's reactions in the last sequence are the best. You can really sense the connection her and Shane have. She sets it up at every step.  *gasp*. That's a genie!" *zoom* "That's a demon! "Exquueze?!" "Now THAT'S the Devil."
Hmmm so the nuns were in on it for  a plot to detract the enemy of the monarchy.
my theory for the professor's future; maybe in this universe, dinosaurs poop puppets? sho The professor will be like a jelly bean, just quickly go through  and still live
NOT ON MY BIRTHDAY :(
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Im really crying over a puppet getting eaten by a t-rex on a Saturday night
W-what?
I mean it's nice to see Shane is having fun
RIP too a real one fam
If Shane's work is anything to go by I have to assume this cliffhanger death of the series most beloved character will never be resolved, either that or S5 will just be dogs watching TV, make what you know
Oooh!! First I didn't knew what would be the story here, but now that I've watched it longer: There exist a movie with that story! It's calles "The Devils" and it's really good and creepy. Watched it a few years ago with my dad. Damn, I didn't even REALIZE it was real somehow!!!
As Brian Conley said about Larry the Loafer "IT'S ONLY A PUPPET!". https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f64H3hDa93Y  But saying that it is sad to see The Professor's demise :(
Sara's energy matches the professor sooo much🤣🤣🤣 they should go on a date
Ryan is such a great man.... Id never do half of that scary nonsense
sara is too underrated. it's actually criminal.
I do believe in ghosts but I think this case was histaria
no puppets were harmed in the making of this video
"posphorus fucked here!" 💀💀
THE LORE!
Avoid shiny red shoes? Someone better tell Dorothy, & the good witch!
What in fuck's name am I watching? XD This is glorious.
WAIT THE PROFESSOR FUCKING DIES????????????? WHAT THE SHIT
Who's gonna take one for the team and wish the professor back to life
RIP to my friends who have a Professor alter… how y’all doin’?
possess me doddeh
“Come on get it” cracks me up and so does “that’s a demon” lmao
The Whataburger slander 😭
How dare you insult our states treasure
Huh, if I had a nickel for every time I've seen an Asmodeus musical number, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice.
i wish these songs were on spotify... asmodeus's song fucks
I can’t believe it’s been 3 months already…..
34:15	A-S-M-O-D-E-U-S
This story really showed me that the wilder possibilities aren't as typical as just... ya know, abuse of political power and poor mental state
did anybody notice the amodius glitch at the beginning of the video during the watcher logo
Wow, 2021 gave us two great songs by Asmodeus
oh my God what a wild ride
As a texan, very sad about Ryan shitting on Whataburger 😔
FIRST OF FUCKING ALL WHY DID I TAKE SO LONG TO WATCH THE FINALE AND SECONDLY WHAT TBE FUCK
Shane: what is going on with these nuns?!?! Me, remembering the Salem witch trials: idk man bitches be cray sometimes.
Dude really had a demon in his butt and testicles. Demons out here giving people prostate cancer.
Lmmfao! Who doesn't have Asmodeus on speed dial!?? Very obviously assigned to the digit "7" !!! Lol! If you ever get an entity that comes through a spirit box or EVP that's  claiming the name "Seven(7)" - then you are likely interacting with the entity that many believe to actually be the demon "Asmodeus". Just an FYI! 😁
So no one’s gonna mention that Ryan called Whataburger the worst thing to ever enter his body…. I’m hurt
Grandier looked like Oliver Reed and Sister Jeanne looked like Vanessa Redgrave!
Do *you* remember where you were when Ryan killed the Professor?
quick question, is Shane still writing/composing these songs? :)
Great video but giving a dislike for the sole reason of Ryan dissing Whataburger
“Ladies and gentlemen…France!” -The Professor 😂
i need all of the puppet history songs on spotify
"Asmodeus. Why? What, you got him in your phone or something?" *Obey Me players sweats nervously*
puppet history lore
yo his foot fell asleep at the same time as mine and it’s the right one hahaha
"Since this isn't one of those lazy shows that leave things unsolved" 😂
Idk getting eaten by a T-rex is a pretty cool way to go
So Ryan is basically Judas
I don't know if anyone noticed but at 41:01 Ryan becomes a clown
I know everybody's talking about the professor's death and that I'm a little late, BUUUT Here's my conspiracy theory about the professor's name It is  ( drum rolll....) Morris Ashley  Reason : if you search Shane Madej on YouTube you'll find his old channel. The first vid there is extreme science. And my God it is gold. And I mean pure gold. Its like 14yrs old ( I my self was like 7 months when it was released ) & in that vid Shane is a PROFESSOR named MORRIS ASHLEY. I think maybe they took inspiration from it and named this professor Morris?
That's a genie! and that's a demon! kills me every time.
I can't with the "TWISTED SISTERS" headline. All I can think about is Meredith and Cristina. LMAO.
do you think the nuns ever explored each others bodies
I love how the professor, despite falling to is death, had to squeeze in a brag about the season finale
being officially, legally charged with "sorcery" is... kinda baller tbh
im in pain but that song really slapped
Puppet History Asmodeus vs Hazbin Hotel Asmodeus
asmodeus is also the demon of lust so there's something poetic yet disturbing about a bunch of nuns (& the professor) being possessed by asmo
Why is ureil in the demon roll call isnt he an angel https://id.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uriel
“This isn’t one of those lazy shows that leaves things unsolved at the end”
Alright, the Wikifeet watermark got me.
Dogs Dick.
I’m truly impressed by the acting chops of all these guys
I will say ilove that Ryan plays along, I believe he did even at buzzfeed with the hotdoga but I he didn't I'm glad he does it now.😁
Imagine a dumbass like me who stopped watching before the song started and had no clue what valence till I heard from other videos what happened
The Ryan Bergara shirt was great,
I bet asmodeous jams this song
shane is like jim hensons weird little nephew who is equally talented
You should do a puppet history about Julie D'Aubigny. She was a very interesting French woman.
Duuuuudes noooooooo
GUYS. THE DINO DIDN'T EAT THE SATCHEL. HIS LIFE SOURCE DIDN'T DIE. LIKE YEAH HE'S CANONICALLY DEAD, BUT HE CAN BE CANONICALLY REVIVED BY PUTTING JELLIES INTO THE SATCHEL, IN THEORY. SORRY IF I ACTUALLY PREDICTED SOMETHING, IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A VERY INTENTIONAL DETAIL.
I just cracked up at the "Ladies and Gentlemen: France."
I would be happy to donate any props needed for future puppets, free of charge! I can 3D print anything!
Season 5 is going to be about dinosaurs.
the c dog bit shouldnt make me laugh as hard as it does
Ok then idea wich is a mix of a couple. Rayn takes over  then the past championship rebel  and then Rayn is forced to get the professor back. And then at the end Rayn gets a, win agaist the Jennie  and the devil. Then  professor then returns
honestly if i was on the show at some point i'd just yonk the puppet off Shane's hand do a suplex for a bit, completely unscripted
petition to release all the songs from s1-4 on spotify
ryan is a clown, not only did he get tricked into killing the professor, but if you look closely after he says it costed him everything he has clown make up
That look on Ryan's face during that song and quietly realizing he actually likes it
day 2 of requesting a Battle of Blair Mountain puppet history episode
I'm actually speechless omfg
Ryan, hon, Please take a break from this stuff. You are not processed, you do not have demons within you. You are surrounded by a thick (a Thicc) shield of Light and Love and the energy of all the love and light on your side always. I could tell you genuinely dissociated, and I'm sorry you went through that. I think the close mindedness of what's her face made your brain keep saying demons are real in retaliation (understandably, as a believer myself, I get upset when people say magik isn't real, though I don't impose my beliefs, I just remind myself I can only control my own mind and thoughts and not others) but that made you more susceptible to manipulation by dark thoughts or darkness in any form. But Ryan, Remember. You control your temple. You have the power and the rare kind ofstrong spirit, and all you need do is declare with conviction, confidence, and as many times as it takes for any darkness inside you to understand (do not use their names, do not give them power, for they have none to start.) That NOTHING that is not of light and love is welcome in your home or your body temple. You can burn sage, sweet grass, Cedar and tobacco (I'm Native Canadian and a strong study in Shamanism and those are known as the Four Sacred Gifts, each cleansing one of the four directions and all in between. Sage is peoples go to, but you can use all four as I'd strongly recommend to burn and cleanse your home with, (Abalone shells are traditional to use, and safe, as well as a feather to waft. But Sticks you can burn the end of while holding are also available and just as affective to carry through your home and every room)) and Set the Intentions of your space and again with conviction, Announce beyond a doubt that They are unwanted visitors, and are unwelcome by the name of all that is light and love, in whatever words and how ever many words you need. Ryan, you're okay. Please step back from dark subjects and dark places, just until you regain the feeling of control and that you are the only processor of your mind, body, spirit and emotions, and only light and love are welcome to enter and you are the only one who can allow them in. If already in, its not too late to regain yourself. You're only being suaded right now, do not fall for the dark thoughts. They only want to bring you down and make you an easier target (it's a downward spiral. But a slow one, and a weak one. Though it feels big, You, Ryan, Are Bigger. And more real in our realm than they can ever dream to. They're bound to other realms. Don't let them poke your screen door and make you feel them inside, because your door is closed and guarded by light. Darkness only exists of the Shadow Light forms. And will never be more than shadows in even their own realm. You are Made of light, not shadows, Ryan. Light will prevail. And your light will prevail to. You only have to believe it will.) And know that you are more powerful than anything of darkness. I risked a possession/haunting by *o*o (I won't say his name.) While writing a play about demonic possession using his name a lot, and giving him a lot of power in the scenarios in my play that he saw a window and started stepping in. I told my class what was happening and they all agreed I Had to stop writing it, so I did. One day I'll pick the idea back up, but smarter and safer. But what I mean is I know what I'm talking about And I prey to God, Light, Wakhan Tanka, Buddha, fucking insert God name here, you see this, Ryan, because you Need to step back fora break and realise your power and gain confidence in your Spirit before re-entering.  Love and all good wishes Ryan. You got this. I know you got this.
if it's not puppet history or drunk history I would rather be ignorant XD
oh shit there's plot
You guys should do a video about the time when England had colonized India, decided there were too many Cobras, then started paying people to bring in dead cobras- unintentionally starting a massive cobra breeding operation in India, resulting in MORE cobras
So.... the series is dead then? Because Ryan and Sarah cannot hold this show on their own... and if the professor is canonically dead... then yeah... well... Watcher as a channel was good while lasted. Now it's just shit ghost stories and making mid level celebrities expensive food.
Yo.. no.. he is not dead... I refuse to accept...
NOOOOOOOOOOO
Has the professor dropped an album yet?
I just realized that at the end the picture that use is an image of the professor with a "wikifeet" watermark. LMAO
If you want some sugestions fore next season, here is 2 mad jack churchill Jack Sheppard.
NOW SOMEONE NEEDS TO MAKE A DEAL TO BRING THE PROFESSOR BACK
Why am I just now realizing the genie is also Shane
Kate's schtick at the end with the genie, demon and devil is so fantastic.
Hoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
I get introduced into the series, and this ended up being the second episode I ever watched just beacues it was at the top of the play list. I was not expecting this and I feel so bad that it looks like we are not going to see anymore of this and it honestly feels like a really tragic end. But good things must come to an end some time I suppose.
27:56  just a reply button for me :")
Does Shane do his own puppet crafting? Because a two handed and three mouthed puppet is pretty damn impressive.
Is this the end of the series?
so are we getting a sub or?
I love buzzfeed but this channel with Shane and Ryan is so much better Shane is fantastic with the story telling and songs he reminds me of my son who also sings and does voice acting well done guys
I really hope this isn't the end, I've learned more about history from these videos then school ever did and they're a joy to watch
as a texan, i hate my state, but ryan hating on whataburger may be too much
Just had to pause the video, run and put pants on just to share with everyone in the house that Ryan thinks Whataburger is the worse thing that has ever entered his body. We live in South Texas, and cannot stop laughing.
“The pastor is out here boinkin” “also many have died from the plague” 🤣🤣
So wait. What if this is actually the series finale and that’s just how it ends? I don’t know if I’ll be okay.
the caNONICALLY DEAED KILLED ME
ryan disturbed and questioning everything after that song ... sarah "yay i loved it!"
Surprisingly this is the second time I’m seeing asmodeus perform a musical this year....
Ryan i love you but I will not allow such whataburger slander in this household
whats a reverse exersisum            its when the devil tells the preist to get out of the child xdd
THE SHADE THROWN AT 31:52
Who wants to tell the Professor about the “House of Asmodeus” from Helluva Boss
I was planning to do homework after this not being emocionally destroyed
Saint Nicholas saved the Pickle Boys, St. Nick will save The Professor. 😁
I just realized that the professor told on the first episode of the season that there would be no lore and everything would be precisely as it was so maybe this is like a rick and morty episode and nothing is real
I'd also put it as my ringtone.
I would totally buy this song!.
Please for the love of anything good in the world don't take away puppet history it's the only history I can learn.
Is this the story about the horny nuns that blamed it all on that French guy being a demon
omg I can't believe this whole season was a set-up! Well played, Ryan.
I hope this doesn’t go away. I enjoy these so much. Maybe Ryan takes over for the professor? Or Ryan tries to undo his evil deed because he didn’t actually want the professor to die?
What if on Ghost Flies The Professor haunts Ryan?
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE ASMODIUS SONG????
The look of pride and awe on Sara's face during the musical
Top 10 Anime Betrayals
i was praying ryan would say shane madej as one of the deomns possesssing him HAHHA
Please tell my the professor's songs are in spotify
admodeus song goes hard as hell
what just happened
um, actually, it doesn't count as you saying smth then you're possesed. sourse: then beetle juice said his name three times while possessing people in the musical, it doesn't work as if they said his name three times themselves
dudes, the fuck. history is grim enough, why you gotta kill my favourite proffessor?
Demon called Alex made me laught  This comment was brought to you by my ex Alex. My ex Alex - at least they haven't posessed me
such fun...Hxx
NOOOOOOOO THE PROFESSOR 😭😭😭 I loved the genie lore… I need more professor lore 😭 come back to us !!
The amount of effort and dedication that goes into these puppet history episodes is incredible lol I love this series!
Ryan should have won the demon names His were so much better lol
PLEASE DO NAHUA/MEXICA/AXTEC HISTORYYYYYYY!!! SHAAAAANNNNNEEEEE!!!
I just know Sarah has seen Fleabag
So the priest that got possessed pulled a Shane?
Well, that was an epic season finale.
when i heard the professor was gonna die i actually thought ryan was gonna choke him out or something
Noooo!
He ded...ded as hell
So when are we getting all the songs on an album cause I need it 😂😂😂
if you haven’t already, you guys should do an episode on Empress Wu Zetian. She’s the first and only female emperor of china.
R.I.P... to a real one
So Midnight Mass is based on a true story
Starting to sound like a PR stunt by the “no match for Jesus”
I love the demon azmodius (idk if that's how its spelled) because my friend called me Ozmodius as a play on how my name starts with "Oz", the fact that I have a joke with my friends that I'm a demon that they summoned, and the fact that I'm asexual, and I'm like the opposite of the personification of lust lmao
"What's that singers name? Urbain Grandier?" "No grandma, it's Ariana Grande"
tbh i love the end song but ill always associate the name "asmodeus" with a character from a tumblr askblog
The history of Alcibiades is pretty cool too! Wacky Spartans! #puppethistoryis the best
I would love to see a show about the history of the Smithsonian. Supposedly, one of the directors had 2 families, each unaware of the other & he compulsively dug tunnels, (though not to go back & forth between them as was rumored!) #puppethistoryrules
I want to suggest they look into the history between Edison & Tesla & that poor elephant that got killed. #lovepuppethistory
I get why the professor has never had Shane on the show, he’s constantly hitting on his girlfriend
look I know that ending is really emotional but the joker makeup slowly fading onto Ryan's face made me absolutely LOSE it
Whataburger is fucking amazing!
The Professor (Shane) : What demons are possessing you? Me : Anxiousus, Afraidofmyparentseth, and I can never forget Awkwardoth
Canonically dead???? NOOOOOOOOO
13:13 okay but where is ricky goldsworth...
I'm actually kinda sad The Professor didn't die on a lazy river face-down in Boca Raton like he wanted to.
You should invite Logan from OBSERVE for next season!!
This better not be the end of puppet history...I'm in literal tears from laughing and sadness
Theory: In the Jose Rizal episode the book sung about how the crusty dinosaur ate a professor whole in effort to warn possibly the professor about his fate and was really a book written by Jose Rizal who wrote down the adventures of past and future from the professor. Maybe Jose could as well used this to help Change the fate but it didn’t work. Another thing was that the other puppets could have known this but was merely brushed off or threatened by Ryan.
Is no one gonna talk about the wiki feet watermark over the memorial photo?
Canonically dead yes, but, series finale no…
Well, uhhhhh, I’ve been yelling no at my phone for like, 10 minutes now…..I need help
😭😭😭 why is the white girl so mad at religious ppl
I nearly pissed myself at the french names pronunciation... "jeene" when it's "Jhane", "richeloo" when it's "richeleeheuh"... I'm crying 😂
Ummmm so this has made me emotionally unstable, why would you do this Shane?
Jesus loves you
Ryan- do you believe in ghosts? The Professor, cursed by a djinni, time-traveller, anthropomorphic puppet who poops jellybeans- No
I want a whole album of all the songs in this series. I just want to listen to them over and over again. They're so good!
Cousin of Professor must bring this history back ..please
Whataburger is pretty solid. There's an unrelated restaurant with the same name that I've only ever seen in Georgia and the Carolinas. The legitimate Whataburger has an orange logo, where the central Piedmont version has a blue logo. The one with the blue logo used to sell deep fried oysters.
Poodles don't believe in ghosts either.
Lucifer's greatest trick was convincing the world that he doesn't exist. That's why there's all kinds of spooky shit that your friends and family laugh at you for worrying about.
If this is still gonna be a thing, then here is an idea: Frederick of Prussia and his fucking potatoes
"Idk, maybe don't trust the *F U C K I N G DEVIL*". Goated show. Underrated, everyone needs to watch this.
Um professor, Sara has a boyfriend named Shane. Let's be respectful 🤣🤣🖤🖤
Clearly St. Nicholas rescues the professor. I mean St. Nicholas saved the pickle boys. He literally brought them back from the dead (we’ll just believe that for all related purposes). So he can bring back the canonically dead as well.
I don’t know how I was expecting this season to end, but this was not it….
...why cant they just ask the genie to undo the season finale?...i mean...it aint bringing back the dead...XD but anyways...imma miss the blue furball and his jelly beans...and this series...(i hope it returns)
I still can't believe he's dead. I miss him every day....
So...Demons can make dance people, can make them change their voice, fly, they can control the victim's body beyond human capacities, change the colour of their skin...AND YOU ARE TELLING ME THAT THEY ARE "not match" for Jesus??? When he just could, what? turn water into wine? walk over the water? All his substantial actions were a long time ago and were lame. Demons are much more powerful and cool
I love Shane's sense of humor!!!!
The only real possession in this video is that of the professor
Wtaf Ryan you MONSTER
Asmodeus would be fucking  proud with that song!!! so good!!
Think the TV series Da Vinci Demon's had this event similar
27:59 - 28:04😳
Honestly, that was pretty girl boss of Ryan 💅🏻
i mean, they didn't have to go so hard and kill the professor off to tell us there'd be no more puppet history.... i feel empty now
This is the BEST thing I've ever watched!!!
This is the first episode i watched of this series... I have so many questions... welp... I'm off to watch this from the beginning XD
//admittedly, Asmodeus was pretty impressively crafted and played
Hot take, I’m on Ryan’s side with this. Silly puppet shouldn’t have rigged the system so much
I think satan should do like quiz hell for Ryan or the Genie for him to get the professor back like Puppet History Hell: Review where Ryan has to with the previous other player redo the episode and then take a big puppet quiz for like soul jelly beans of the professor.🗿
I wonder when Shane is gonna join Ryan on this fun history ride
Well damn....no season 5 then?
It's a special kind of cruelty to make an earworm song that's got lyrics that invite a named demon into your soul, knowing that there might be involuntarily superstitious people who don't believe in demons but we're raised by a half-lapsed Catholic woman who told them off when they blasphemed by accident. Okay, I mean me, it's me. I can't be walking around singing that shit, thanks guys, I can feel my Mum smacking me up the back of the head from 15 km away.
Marques Duncan really was the keeper of the brain cells, and critical thinking skills in that town, wasn't he.
Posphorus fucked here.
SEASON 5 NOW
who wrote that song? was that shane? that was legitimately impressive
12:38  Joe, Sturgis, Nanya
Apple Tater and Spaghetti Are my favorite
I think that end song was the best that I've ever heard.
Why the professor die though
When she says f@ck it just doesn't fit her.
Wait so like is this their way of ending the show idk what? I think I'm in the denial part of dealing with this. I guess!
I kept wondering why the Nuns had fish in their mouths
He wrote a ghost song 😂
the wikifeet watermark lol
I would love for them to just pull out a puppet ryan moment for when he goes to save the professor
I don’t think they’d kill off the professor, there’s too much merch with him in it
Is there gonna be a season where Ryan saves the professor...pls
Can….can I download asmodeus on iTunes?
Is that the end to puppet history????
This show is amazing. The songs are amazing. The lyrics are great, and Shane’s vocal range is quite amazing.
Just a reminder that the time traveling professor from who-knows-what period of origin once 'accidentally' called Ryan DAD.
:O :O :O Professor!!
41:00 whoever had the idea to edit the joker makeup is a GENIUS
31:51 🧐👁👄👁
*gasp* "GAAAASP"
Dog’s dick
I just discovered that there was a 12 year old Pope in 1032 who served three terms and if it is NOT ON BRAND. FOR THIS CHANNEL. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS. Pope Benedict IX. Omfg. Please. I will do all of the research you need. SHANE PLEASE.
I was watching paranormal activity 2021 and the devil is Asmodeus, I couldn't help myself to come here and listen to this song.
Ok, so in rewatching this season I just realized The Professor alludes to being reborn like Gandalf in the Richest Man in History episode. That he’ll come back in a new form.
Hey if you make another season of Puppet History could you please do Kathrine the Great please
I love puppet history!
Only 10 minutes in but this already sounds like if Monty Python made The Exorcist and I wanna watch that movie
So like….he’ll come back right….because if it’s a pattern from this point he could pass in weird ways….then it’s like a Kenny thing he d!es all the time but comes back. Please just say yes theses got me back into liking history.
Have to admit that Ruining History was kinda good but Puppet History is head and shoulders better.  Rainy day marathon UTubes worthy.   Another season?
Damn the Professor really threw shade at Buzzfeed: Unsolved
Is it just me or does Sara look darker skinned in this video? But maybe I'm crazy.
I really can’t tell at this point please tell me there’s gonna be another season
Sara doesn’t believe in demons Shane and Ryan should take her to the Sallie house
personally I believe Ricky Goldsworth wants Ryan to be happy, but has very unethical methods of getting that happiness (including killing adorable little blue puppets) and I think he took over for a lot of this episode, especially the ending. and then after Ryan got the trophy it looked like he kinda snapped back to myself again, almost like Ricky got tired of the professor being so mean to Ryan and took matters into his own hands and Ryan couldn't stop him.  that's just my theory :)
What have we learned today? Back in the day, boredom made people do a lot of crazy sh**!
I'd imagine the orb being a bowling ball and the nuns as pins. 😂
FUCK, at 39:26, just as the genie disappears, you can see in the background all the anthropomorphic objects returned to their non-sentient original forms Jesus Christ
Wait, the series isn't over, is it?  This is the first episode of Puppet History I've seen!  What happened here??????????
Season finale… but not the *series* finale Hmmmmm
I have this show on my to watch list forever. My god what I have been missing!
I'm watching these out of order and what noooo I don't want the professor to dieee
Its official, Ryan's the Joker.
Been a fan since the beginning... seen every episode. SOOOOOOO  When can we expect news. Ya. Know about season 5@!! The professor has .cullt following that spans the. Ages. We know where you liive....
It’s funny how many songs Asmodeus is getting lately. First this then Helluva Boss
Aye! Just realized this history lesson is mentioned in the priest's research in The Exorcist book; knew it sounded familiar lol
I always stick to the end because i always love the songs.
no joke, I rewatch these videos all the time, and every time that genie shows up (forgot which episode it is), I actually scroll or close my eyes cuz it freaks me out haha
The next season should ryan and co. Going throug all of the past lessons to find the professor
I DIDN'T THINK THIS WOULD END WITH ME IN TEARS WTF WATCHER
Can you guys do an episode about the Franklin Expedition??!
Ryan’s maniacal grin slowly getting crueler is giving me life
Me: *hears Asmodeus* Wait! Like the House of Asmodeus! 🎶From the groin to the bust~🎶In desire we trust~🎶In the House of Asmodeus~🎶
The Jellybean Satchel wasn't swallowed............ My resurrection senses are TINGLING!
No!!! Professor 😭
Dang. The Thanos reference
If this IS the end of Puppet History, then all I can say is BOOOO! That's an awful way to go out.
I hope he pulls through. I only enjoy history when Professor McNasty teaches it.   I have a theory of the lore. What if Ryan is in purgatory or his own personal hell where he's cursed to relive his own failures repetitively? This would be confirmed if the Professor were to come back like nothing happened. The genie thing and the death of the Professor was just a deception to make Ryan feel like his suffering was finally over. He didn't WIN the trophy after all. Food for thought.
that song was incredible
Weird how there are two banging songs song by Asmodeus on the internet net now.
NOT THE WIKIFEET WATERMARK GOODBYE
EVERYBODY SHUT UP AND APPRECIATE HOW FUCKING AMAZING SHANE AND RYAN ARE AT ACTING ???????
puppet history lessons vs puppet history lore
I have to say, props to that priest who likely believed he damned himself to Hell by taking on those demons for those nuns. Props to that guy, what a real one
Fatality: Flawless Victory
Please sir, may I have some more Professor?
Noooooooo the professor rip bro
What the heck is with France?! This is like the 5th video of stuff going down in France.
The subtle jokerfied makeup edit as Ryan says "everything" at the end is *chef's kiss*
yo jezus hmu
Lmao Marvel call back I see, but how could you do that to the Professor!!!? 😭 you monster!
The ending was like a scene from “Hell Girl”
i can’t believe ryan slandered whataburger like that.
34:16 This is my favorite puppet history song from now on, Its just so damn well mixed with its catchy and sinister undertone xD
god i hope thay do an episode on the east India trading company it would be really interesting to see what they dig up on the og evil mega corporation
WHATTHEFUVKFIEOEP
B.
I love how people in the comments here are so invested in the lore
Two completely different Asmodeus songs within the month. An animated masterpiece, and a puppet mastery
here i am, late and confused as usual. and okay yes the professor is dead, but can we talk about what a program this?? the writing? the production? the music? INCREDIBLE. also ryan in clown makeup took me OUT. i’ll see y’all next season in the cretaceous period, gotta go hang out with my boi ✌🏽
Not me crying over a puppet.
I dont know how many times I've watched this but just realized at 40:56  they turn Ryan into a clown lol
Ryan to think I liked you!  Let’s save the professor!
My theory is that it's actually Ricky Goldberg and at the end is Ryan coming back and realizing what just happened. Did Ryan make a deal with the genie through Ricky?!
It wasn't a ghost slapping nuns around, it was the Three Stooges!!!😉
RIP Professor…. But can we just take a few seconds to appreciate the Asmodeus song? 1 2 3 4 5 666!!!!!
you know who loves history and SHOULD definitely guest on this show?? bill fucking wurtz. istg they should invite bill wurtz to the show, that episode would be fucking gold, maybe the professor and bill should collab as well 🤧
ricky goldsworth takes his first life !!!!!!!!
I know I'm a lil late to commenting, but may I put in a formal request for a plushie of the professor, he's just adorable
I love this
hey this is nice. maybe we'll see a new set up next season 🤔
I have no idea why but my brain was really expecting “What did it cost?” “… a friend.”
Please let there be more seasons 🥺 I miss The Professor already
Ryan’s face during asmodeus number
NOOOO THE PROFESSOR
“Now since this isn’t one of those lazy shows that leaves things unsolved at the end”  -The Professor 31:52
You should have Bailey sarian on puppet history 👀
I've experienced too many comic books to seriously believe this is a forever dead. Like, okay, canonically dead right now. But is he really gonna be like that forever?
Can we get “Possess me, daddy.” On a shirt plz… 🤣😂
So....is that the end of Puppet History? I'm legitimately asking.
why was that such a bop tho
But croissants are Austrian 🇦🇹🥐
Not me watching that Helluva Boss episode last night then watching this today.. 2nd time this week I get to watch Asmodeus sing
Nooo. It is Ricky Goldsworth did it??? Noooo that ending...... Whyyyyyyy
"What Demon is possessing you?" Totally missed opportunity on Ryan's part to write 'Shane Madej'
For the past 2 years ive being struggling with a lot  and your channel always makes me feel better. THANK YOU SOO MUCH !!!!!
Where's that jolly old necromancer St. Nicholas when you need him?
This is my first Request. Could you make a Puppet History about Classical Music? And maybe have Brett and Eddy of TwoSetViolin as your Guests? I bet it would be fun for all of us, especially those who are Fans of both History and Classical Music. 😁
1:27 the return of Ricky Goldsworth
Lmao I just noticed the fade into clown makeup on ryan’s face at the end there
Sara = m’y favorite guest
I KNEW IT!!! THE DAY RYAN GOT A TROPHY IS THE DAY THE PROFESSOR FUCKING DIED!!! I KNEW SINCE SEASON 1. But seriously give us are precious blue boi back
Ryan should’ve wrote Shane Medej
don't worry guys, this was all just a build up for an unsolved and puppet history collab.
Hily shit that ending tho
I've never fully grasped Shane's humor during Unsolved, and it makes me so happy watching this series that his humor TOTALLY RESONATES WITH MINE. Hahaha looking forward to more of your videos!
Ricky Goldsworth called. He wants his Ryan back.
Okay but when Ryan did his list, he forgot the true demon tormenting him: the foul beast Ricky Goldsworth
GUYS LISTEN! The book sang "about how long it'd take a crusty old Tyrannosaur to digest your learned body whole" What if this means there's still time?
Im going to miss that little pom pom so much
Possess me daddy😹
Interesting that Asmodeus would show up when that demon name was just used for the new Paranormal activity movie!! Lol
For someone who watched puppet history for the first time this was a whole ass ride for sure
It's great that Sara says she'd hang out with demons, since she's got Shane!
It'd be amazing if the ghost of the Professor now possesses Shane to continue the series..... like the gag is Shane just randomly wakes up from blackouts Yugioh style like "Hey. What am I doing with jellybeans in my mouth and pockets in a strange location? And I've got 53 tabs about ancient history murders on every wifi-connected device I own... Weird. Must've been a strong wind, huh? Anyway." #Who'sthePuppetNow #PuppetMaster
How much did this amazing CGI cost?
They can’t just kill off that beloved character like that
Cant wait for the next season
Theory I had after rewatching other episodes: In the Christmas episode, the Professor accidentally called Ryan “dad.” In the French poisoning episode, it was hinted that the Professor is a human but he keeps eating jelly beans, and he got them from his father.  From the very beginning, it was shown that Ryan loves jelly beans more than anyone else.  What if Ryan is the Professor’s father? And his name is Professor BERGARA?!
Ryan, I believe.
First time watcher…fantastic job guys!
THIS WAS INCREDIBLE
Don't put on the shiny shoes of the devil because you'll dance til you die!!!
A demon named Shane Madej resides in The Professor. And Annabelle resides in Shane Madej. It's a chaotic demonic matryoshka.
I imagine the Genie sending the Professor to someplace worse than dinosaur land. France
i;ve been thinking.  ryan will find the professor encased in amber. thinking quickly, he will clone the professor and restore him to his classroom.   actually, I think he has written himself into a corner and he's hoping someone has an idea to help.
34:00
It’s the dig at unsolved for me😂
So the series is over
I think you guys should do The Pilipino General Heneral Luna set in the Philippine-American War
GODDAMN I KNEW THE ENDING CUS IT WAS SPOILED FOR ME BUT OMG THAT WAS SO GOOD
I can just Imagine the devil going Jesus christ wtf wrong with u people I am  Supposed to be the evil one😈
next season: opens to ryan sitting in his chair holding the trophy *(flashback to all the times he was mad at the professor or mean to him throughout the show ending with when the professor gets sucked back into dino land)* ; ryan drops a single tear on the trophy, looks up with determination fueled by self hatred and loss (anakin much). *here’s where it gets crazy* he decides he needs help to find the genie. he. gets. the. ghoul. boys. back. together!!! they conjure asmodeus and get him to tell them where the genie is. then? they buzzfeed unsolved true crime 2018 season finale this shit! they find the genie. [ryan stops shane] “thank you. for everything. but… this is my journey. i cant ask you for more than you’ve already given.” ryan tricks the genie into giving him the ability to time travel, he travels back in time and tries to time it so he can save the professor. [he’s been trying for five years] but he can’t. meanwhile shane is distraught without ryan so he has made an agreement with the genie to take the place of the professor as history master so long as ryan and the professor come back, in tact and without a clue of what happened, the professor morphs into shane as shane becomes the professor. shane remembers everything and season one of puppet history begins, where ryan can never win because it’s the only way shane can see him anymore. no matter how bitter sweet their relationship is shane treasures every minute of it. but he knows how it ends.
Pouring one out for the blue boy
#SaveTheProfessor
Love that the nun had Have A Great Summer on her hand
Remember the Gandalf the White reference in episode 1?
Asmodius is an ELO fan. I'm into it!
fdfjkdjfkd losing my shit here. the slow buildup to this finale, the way the topic matched what was going to happen at the end, the perfection of that whole series of reveals, the wikifeet stamp over the rip portrait. holy fucking shit, it's art
Will there be a season 5????
I’m surprised the series ended before they even did a vid on WWII
I REALLY HOPE THERES ANOTHER SEASON WE NEED THE PROFESSOR
🤡 exquese me?
Wait...isthis over?
The evil is defeated….
Lesson of the story: You can only push a man so far. #TeamRyan
How dare Sara cheat on Shane like that, and with the professor no less
I stayed to watch this before work and now I’m gonna go in crying.
Important news about the whereabouts of the professor:   I had a dream where professor popped into existence with a puff of smoke. He yelled “YES! I AM ONE FUNKY DEAD GUY!” and then disappeared again. I am 100% sure he is on his way back by jumping to one reality at a time until he founds ours. Glad he popped into my dream realm on his way 😎   So hope someone will tell Ryan the news, he’s coming..
I'm actually legit unhappy that the Professor died (and that the series is done??).
I really want a best of CD with all the songs from the various characters bc they're all bangers
"possesse me daddy" yep ima need a minute to get over that lmao
23:43 the nun to the left is me when its freezing and im in my bed and my mom tells me to go get my own food
The part when Ryans foot got possessed lmao, What a mood.
Dont worry Ricky- I mean, Ryan, I cant touch my toes either.
I knew ricky goldworth would kill professor. Its like putting at cat in front of a fish bowl, it was bound to happen.
Did the professor just die. What did I just watch
Somebody get this man an Emmy
WAIT NO PLS THE PROFESSOR CANT DIE
Anyone else notice what The Professor yelled out as he was getting sucked into the void? “Beef boyyyyyy!”
This cannot be the end of puppet history
Wait, if he's canonically dead, no more puppet history? :(
its sad ryan didnt include ricky goldsworth
Will there be a season 5?
That was some good beans. Well it was technically a bad bean but i guess that was some /good beans/
If there is a hell Richelieu will be second to Hitler in the fiery chasm.
The croissant got me rolling 🤣
I pick Asmodeus 👹
Pez dispenser huh that bad?One word hysteria.
Hits us with a banger then shreds our hearts to pieces 😔
Shane I love your genius
Wait I just realized… Is there another holiday special on the way? Is this going to be addressed in a holiday special?!
I just discovered this series and watched all of it in three days. Fave series
Shane you gotta get some arm poles on the Professor!! Would love to see how you might be able to manage his arm movements, although I know you are managing a lot already haha
Posphorus fucked in the corner of the demon board
I... don't know who to address this to now that the professor is resting in power,  but I'm assuming there will be more? Just thought the Chamapwat tiger would be a fun story.
I rewatched this abd I think Ryan is in on the professor’s disappearance. He mentions the demons name and Is very sus
RYAN BETTER FIX  HIS MISTAKE ASAP please?
every episode with sara in it is my favorite episode
so no more puppet history!?
Someone call MAtPat, I need a lore breakdown on the Professor, theorist style.
Don’t tell me this is the end of Puppet History 🥺 I was really enjoying this series!! I was binging this series after binging True Crime and Supernatural. Ryan you are now required to find a way to bring the Professor back. Or else....   I don’t know what the or else is 😂 I just want the Professor back because I’m sad
Nice song!
*"Satan's got a life-long friend in moi"*   ight my next tattto here i go
34:15 excuse me folks i need this on Spotify asap
Idk who Sara is but she's so sweet and funny, I enjoyed her participation in the episode so much!!!
Hey professor can you please do an episode on Jim Thorpe, a Native American man famed for being an Olympic gold medalist, a professional American football player, a professional baseball player, and a professional basketball player. Amazing athlete and an awesome story.
I had to rewatch some parts cuz the background music as too good
The Professor: *canonically dies* Everyone: Lies! Deception!
I love how we have gone from "guest on buzzfeed unsolved" to "singing dancing history writing talent man"
*laughs in disbelieve* no
All I could think of during the intro was the Crime Countdown Podcast with the Morbid girls, y'all should collab
can shane make music plz??? all these songs are absolute bangers
I had a theory at the beginning that they had something similar to Parkinson’s which starts with major tremors but by the end it was just attention lovers and crazed nuns
Canonically Dead *for now
13:58 No Shane demon ?
The Unsolved: Supernaturak and Puppet History nobody saw coming
31:51 bruh
RIP the professor. You will be miss
not a fan, bring him back. now.
My dad's literally just died.. I didn't need to lose him AND the professor at once.. :(
Lol this shouldn’t have been the first episode I watch
@Sara Rubin. I must admit to developing a slow burning crush on Sara Rubin. I will not stalk you, don’t worry, but lets say I wouldn’t mind If you stalked me just just a little bit. Semi-stalking? Yeah, as If that would ever happen. 😉
Ryan's possession of Ricky Goldsworth?
Anyone else reminded of another song, with this one? there's something about "The endless screaming void and lil old me" that sends me to another place but I can't remember the song it sends me to 😭
I Just watched the final season of buzzfeed unsolved and i found out this channel just now. Good think that i am reading comments from another fan.Thanks!
😭😭😔Professor!!!! No!!!!!This is so sad!🤍🤍🤍
Lol that unsolved dig
Why is no one talking about how the asmodious song hits
aw this season felt so fast but time goes fast when your having fun. they deserve a break for how much goes into this show. so cheers for another season!
Canonically dead. Shane. Why. Sir. pls. this was my only crumb of serotonin.
Really hoping that next season we get to see sweet Gene and the risky fixins preform...
Woah woah woah. Don't you talk shit about Whataburger. It's waaaay better than that in-n-out bullshit
the wikifeet watermark is everything
Calling whataburger awful is basically sacrilege in its own right and I can only assume it was bad because you were in Austin
34:19
the demon song slapped harddd that puppet was so good three heads is cool
i knew something was up with ryan the second he said that c dogs was the best bit on the show
I think you guys should put puppet history on nebula
WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED HERE
12:18 I love how at least 3 of them were just the nuns going "aw, shoot, I need to come up with a demon name but all I have to work with in memory is bible verses. Uhh, isaac....aaron!"
"My foot just got possessed" 😂😂😂😂
Epic and bravo
In-N-Out hate is always approved… Whataburger slander is a jail sentence in Texas
Me at the begining: Oh wow like The Devils! Me halfway through: Oh literally The Devils!
Ok but why is no one talking about the WIKIFEET watermark over the professors memorial??
damn, that end bit was so good
i thought i pressed on an episode about the dancing french people, rest assured it only took me a nun all red with the devil horns to conclude i was wrong
Tell me this isn’t the last season, please.
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
That puppet is a genie (aka demon)..  Those nuns did something, they knew it.
Honestly the most surprising thing is Ryan participating in the plot. Like the hot dogga had to cut his voice together to make a mad egg. That’s actual character growth.
NOOOOOOO PROFESOOR
I did not see that coming
You can watch a great but disturbing movie about these events named The Devils from 1971
is this... really the end..
holy crap! I gotta learn Yoga from one of these nuns! there like those super bendy people in the circuses!
Ha ha ha what the professor really been sucked into the black hole yeah this is crazy I mean wow Ryan you did get your trophy but was it worth it I don’t know I don’t know man I mean this season was exquisite thanks guys see you next round
Ryan: I can't touch my toes. Me: Me too Ryan. Me too.
I swear that this was made into a movie ages ago....but I can't seem to find this movie anywhere  Edit: NEVER MIND! this movie is called The Devils, and was released in 1971. Unfortunately, it was banned, but I'm not too sure why
Please save the Professor Ryan!  Rally up the troops (aka other contestants and sock puppets)!  Bring jellybean sling shots and holy water guns to the battle; make Satan and History your B!@tch
When he kept listing all these demonic names then randomly said "Alex" I laughed till my chest hurt
5:30 that's Syndra
ryan why
See, I'm a little worried here, because the Hot Daga also had a "season" finale, and then we never heard of it again... so... I... I'm a little worried the professor is actually dead... :'(
I'm genuinely upset that a puppet is dead, WTF?
Ryan should have voiced Mario with that Dracula impression.
The little Infinity War reference at the end made me cry
Jaw dropping ending 😢
The Professor can not be dead! My two year old loves this show. He’s been watching this and obsessed with this show since he was barely one year old.   How will I explain this to my kid 😳
Wow Asmodeus is a real bop
I’m actually like really sad 😭
I just imagine the nuns voguing while nodding menacingly
WE'VE ENTERED THE NO LORE ZONE
Im like 2 weeks late but  god damm this was a good one
that's crazy dude! I'm so happy with these episodes
Ladies and Gentlemen.. France!
I KNEW IT!!! I KNEW IT!!! I KNEW IT!!! THE SEASON WAS SUS AND COVERED IN LUR!!!
why am i crying
Perfect twist. I love you guys. Nobody on YouTube is putting out content like you folks. Keep it up forever and ever!!!
I was NOT prepared for that ending.
Ryan: I've won....but at what cost...
I have that exact same Devil puppet
Is this the end?
"Ladies and Gentlemen, France.". SAVAGE.
Draculini
Ryan what have you *DONE*
I'm away for a season or 2 and ryan goes and kills the professor. I'll tell you what,  it wouldn't have happened under my watch.
*everyone:* talking about ryan doing his part to get rid of the professor *me:* still focused on *"possess me daddy"*
Next season is Ryan trying to teach history to guests (Sarah now replaces him as permanent guest) and the songs are them trying to decipher clues left in carvings from the professor
There's a subtle mention of the word 'unsolved' that got me laughing.
the ending was more heartbreaking than the notebook what the fuck
"Since this isn't one of those lazy shows where they leave things unsolved," omg the shade
I really loved buzzfeed unsolved with all my heart but the boys needed to leave so they can make what they actually want to make. I fully understood and accepted this thanks to this episode.
I love The professor's "Beeeeeeef Boooooooyyyy!!!" At the end there.
Woah that ending was so unexpected it’s better than any plot twist ending show I’ve ever seen
holy shit that ending was more dramatic than a netflix show (and with better GCI too) ryan betray plotwist wow, this was so good tho like?
Is the professor mortal??? If not he might just be living through history instead of taking visits, and I have a feeling he's going to be coming to whoop Ryan any day now lol.
this is the first episode of puppet history I've ever watched,,, THERE'S LORE???
I just binged watched the series and wow. Poor Ska Horse, he tried so hard.
Next season Randy will take over
ayo guys i think the professor is just shane
WHAT. YOU CAN'T LEAVE US LIKE THAT!!!!
they need to hire some of y’all as writers.
Ryan when deciding  how to win the history master: what do you say, wackus  bonkus?  The genie: kill him!! Ryan: hoo! You naughty wackus  bonkus!
The professor in heaven: GOSH DAMNIT RYAN
Y’all owe me for my therapy bill after killing the professor
I thought this was just a silly little show about history. WHERE DID ALL THIS LORE COME FROM??
28:01 merch plz lol. Vinyl sticker. You know someone gonna do it
Time to go on an adventure to rescue the professor!!!     Edit: wait canonicallly....dead? No....no...I loved puppet history....no....NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Okay... you better bring the professor back! He's the best (and probably only) Puppet-teacher in the world! I need more Puppet History!!!
So I started watching this the day it can out, and just now finished it 10 days later cause I didn't want it to be over, and I do have to say I'm relieved that even though Ryan plotted against the professor, he wasn't planning to kill him
I NEED MORE WHAT THE FUCK
i feel like ryan and sara toked before this episode😭
the biggest demon in my (and all of our) bodies is capitalism unfortunately </3
RIP professor
"Posess me, Daddy!" With the professors face needs to be a shirt or poster or some shit
CANONICALLY dead??? does this he can come back as a ghost tho
I will never recover from this emotional devastation.
I love this show so damn much. Thank you for existing.
I hope Shane does a behind the scenes on how he moved the third mouth of Asmodeus, because all I can picture right now is someone sitting on his lap moving the middle head while he moved the other two
HWTA THWYS
NOT THE WIKIFEET WATERMARK ON THE MEMORIAL
No one is going to mention how Sara, Shane’s girlfriend/wife said she’d hang out with demons.   I’m not saying Shane’s a demon but I mean not, not saying it either
We’re never gonna let Ryan live down that small bottle of holy water are we
no ones talking about how the professor is canonically dead now?    altho I guess dead doesn't mean never seeing him again.... right?
My fear of photosensitive seizures had me watching this with my eyes closed at the end but great episode 👏
This new Ghost BC track ft. Asmodeus is really hitting
how does that $1 plastic taste, Ryan? HUH?! probably like jellybeans and puppet blood
Would be interesting if you did an episode on Diogo Alves. Serial killer from Portugal who was decapitated and his head kept in a jar by the government. Just saw a documentary on this from another channel and would love to see a Puppet History lesson
So basically the puppet from PUPPET HISTORY has become a _history_
RYAN DID NOT JUST DISS WHATABURGER!!!!!!!!!!!
😭😭😭😭😭😭
Great. Fuckin. Finale.
I mean Hell probably does have fabulous record keeping. After all, that's where the lawyers are. 😂
How was Ricky Goldsworth not a demon name Ryan!!  Also this can't be the end of the Professor, he's my favourite educator.
The Professor will be fine guys. I bet he's just doing the Gandalf/Balrog thang; next season he'll come back bigger, better, bolder, brighter, bluer, and maybe even with a working arm!💪
Before I watch this I just gonna theorize that Ryan made a deal with the devil
31:52 The professor taking shots at Ryan's unsolved episodes 😂😭
Why am I sad over a puppet? What the fuck is happening?  RIP The Professor He didn't even get to die on a lazy river :(
I never thought  the story of a blue furrball  could make me cry
god damn it ryan
Sara eating the imaginary jelly beans is the cutest thing I’ve seen all year
"Whataburger is one of the worst things that entered my body" How dare you
why the fuck is this song such a banger tho
Any Shanics feel betrayed?
Poor Ryan lol.... surrounded by skeptics
“I scare the shit outta nuns, cause it’s fun!” Lmaooooo 🤣
I really hope the professor will be alright...
Ryan, you had the audacity to do a Thanos at the end of Infinity War.  (I can’t wait to see what the future of the show looks like.)
Professor: POSSESS ME DADDY! That's getting taken out of context
One day I will understand how these two bad boys can be so dramatic
"Asmodeus his Unholiness" has a real Electric Light Orchestra feel to it.
That ending was....something else *a standing ovation, tears streaming down cheeks, cheers, whistles, the whole shebang*!!!!!!!!!!!!
17:45  I love how Ryan sounds so fond of the Professor here 🥰
Shane: Professor, I need to tapk about the Fifth Season of Puppet History. Professor? Where are you Professor?
Reference to Infinity war at the end.
WHAT
Beloved puppet professor dies: *All hail the watcher*
what the fuck?!
Possess me, daddy.
0:37 SHANE THE PROFESSOR IS TRYING TO STEAL YOUR GIRL
I didn't think I'd become so attached to a fuzzy little blue puppet but here I am
please make a spodify i'm begging u
35:55 the reference haha
Omg noooooooo!
so like i refuse to believe puppet history is coming to an end, so therefor this is just a joke
This needs an Academy Award
At the time I’m looking at this their are 666k views.
@34:31 Ryans face 🤣
Did anyone else notice how all the anthropomorphic objects at the party went back to their old forms after the genie came?
Wow look at how many views this video has...666
21:36 - (wheeze)
Fucking GENIE LET'S GOOOOO!!!
like what the fuck is this.
i am ashamed the ruan didnt say ricky as a demon that possessed him
They gotta bring him back right?!?!
Rest in Professor, Peace.
if they tought like this in school maybe we would actually pay attention to history and everything alot more. And we'd understand the lesson.
aww shane calling sara his moon and stars just made my day
i refuse to accept that cannon death

(Clears throat-) NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
YALL THIS BETTER NOT BE THE END OF PUPPET HISTORY
Ryan's face slowly being covered in clown makeup as it fades out behind the devil laughing is absolutely the right touch for the tone of that moment
Signed a deal with the devil but literally
I need the Asmodeus song as my ringtone STAT!
Is puppet history over forever now ?
Looks like it's time to put Regulators on my iPod and mount up! I'm goin' Genie huntin' to make him bring The Professor back and let him resume his time travels!
I didn't know puppet death could make me so sad
I am crushed
Okay...Uhuh...This is fine. Everything is fine.
"Since this isn't one of those lazy shows that leaves things unsolved at the end.." Ouch! The professor taking a jab.
This may actually be a more tragic ending than Quantum Leap. 🧑‍🍳🤌💋
No no no no no, this isn’t right THE PROFESSOR NO BRING HIM BACK NO NO NONO NONO
I also think the jelly beans are his source of power
I really wish when she asked what it cost he said well 1/2 pack of menthol cigarettes, $3.10, and lamp polish.
What demon is 'ALEX' ?????
PROFESSOR NO😭😭😭😭
This was literally my first episode of Puppet History, i got so attached to the Professor so quickly only for him to be gone so fucking soon 😭😭😭 time to binge the rest of the series ig 😔
After having watched Supernatural, I can say with some certainty that death is not permanent
I just got back from Texas and loved Whataburger
Some of us move on… but not Ryan.
Hi all! I would really like to watch this episode, but any sort of flashing lights can trigger migraines for me. Would someone be willing to let me know at what time that happens in the video so I can flip my phone so the screen is face down for that part? With as few spoilers as possible please. It would be greatly appreciated.
You know, I always see Shane‘s name in the credits, but he’s never been on the show. I guess he just isn’t interested :(
Ryans mind palace is definitely a scooby-doo style haunted house.
NOOOOOOOOO!!!!  Bring him Back!!!!!!
WIKIFEET?
"Phosphorus f*cked here" 😂
you guys owe me big time for this I did not just witness my favorite little guy get eaten. We deserve plushies of him for our collective trauma.
Now would be the time for the God phone, no?
Love seeing Sara! Super upset about the professor.
Woah her answer about what she thought of demons was very concerning, so much void in that statement. Humans can be so naive it startles me sometimes. #Boogara Edit: That was a masterpiece I'm speechless...
Et Tu Ryan?
Everyone in these comments has great storytelling ability, it's very impressive. Anyway, I'm gonna go contemplate my life without the continuation of puppet history now.
Bye bye Professor 👋
WAIT WHAT DOES THIS MEAN NOOOOOOO PROFESSOR EWHFAKLFJVBQEFHVBQE RYAN HOW COULD YOU DO THISSSSDSSSSS
How did Ryan NOT list Ricky Goldsworth as a demon???
Puppet history isn't over though, right? He'll, he'll come back right?
Why am I feeling so sad about a puppet dying?!?!?!? Does this mean puppet history is no more?
31:56 "Self-burn, those are rare"
Everybody’s talking about the ending, but no one is mentioning how Ryan totally disrespected Whataburger like that.
WHAT NO FUCK NO FUCK THIS SHIT THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE BRING HIM BACK YOU DIDNT ANNOUNCE THE SHOW WAS COMPLETELY ENDING RESURRECT HIM RIGHT NOW I WANNA KEEP LEARNING HISTORY
SHANE HOW DARE YOU KILL OFF OUR BOY WTF
can we just appreciate the amount of build up that went into this episode oh my god????
Okayy... Is that What if? 🥲
Happy to finally see Ryan Win. He deserves it. Well done, man.
Here's hoping next season is Ryan having to fight through hell and defeat demons through historical trivia competitions to get the Professor back. If not, looks like I gotta figure out how to make a video game
'It took about half a dozen watches to catch the "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 666" count in the Asmodeus song. Damn, Madej, the detail
What have you done Ryan? I am so damn furious! How could you betray the Professor? All he wanted to do was teach you history and this is how you repay him!   You need to fix this Ryan and rescue the Professor!!!!!
that Asmodius song slaps!
CANONICALLY DEAD!?!
Warhammer pop quiz: Which Chaos God would the professor and Ryan worship / fall to if they existed in the 40k universe?
OMGGGG SUCH A GOOD EPISODE ! Please Satan, gives us back our professor !
oh no professor >:)
Can we get some more too many spirits pls
Ummmmmmmmm Mmmmmmmmm Mmmmm the fuck
I'm really here for the Avengers parody arc where Ryan goes back to the Cretaceous Period & marries a dinosaur
professor pls come back i love you
9:51 Twisted Sisters 🤣
oh damn he got joker-fied
Man! This series really deserves way more viewership!
Whoa whoa whoa...😮 Whataburger is a Texas treasure Ryan, so how dare you speak ill of it!  But i cant blame you, you're stomach is probably use to rubbish In and Out Burger so it didn't know how to handle the gastro-blessing that is Whataburger 😋
What has this series become, man?🤣
But what about the horse that kept popping up?
I’ll bet the t-Rex from the end will end up as a fossil and be discovered in the present day and the professor will burst out from it.
wtf the professors dead???????
HELP THE WIKIFEET
idk sounds like the nuns where just actually having seizures???    (edit: I’m not a nurse or doctor so I could be wrong??)
Finally Ryan won🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
They should come to Japan.  This place will change your mind about spirits.
Whoever did the effects for this episode deserves at least $20 extra of what you paid them
NOOO RYAN HOW COULD YOU????!
Wow, that was uh, one "hell" an episode!  Sorry,could not resist. I'm sure our fearless puppet professor will be fine, Ryan just has to find that genie...
bro
I'm heartbroken, The Professor didn't even get to die in a lazy river RIP to a real one
Also Shane Madej has a really beautiful woman. Such an adorable couple 😍
Best finale ever. Never expected that to happen. Ryan has totally gone to the dark side. Started as Skywalker & now he’s Darth Vader
One word: TARDIS
I am here for this....you guys are soo creative
Alright my two cents on this is that, yes, THIS proffesor is dead, but do to a time loop or paradox or whatever, a new professor comes is, same one we had, but a different turn of events happened so he didn't die ... Or the professor just gets pooped out by the dino and just goes through time until he catches up with us
Theory: If there is a next season, it will be where Ryan has to beat the genie to get the professor back, either the genie is the teacher or the 'guest' in every round.
The way Sara says "that's a genie, that's a demon, exueeze?" Killed me.
God I hope this show pulls a Supernatural and makes the prof come back or else Im rioting-
RIP professor
Why are there no top comments about the song? That was spectacular
WHAT
So uh does that mean this was the last season?
Well, looks like the professor is... Puppet 𝘏𝘪𝘴𝘵𝘰𝘳𝘺
Did... did... the Professor Just... die? Tf!!!!!
WHAT???
Omg. I never thought that I would have a soft spot for the professor. 🥺
Wait, what... What?  WHAT!?!?  😢
So what I'm taking from this is we need to make a deal with the Devil to save and bring back the Professor? I'm in. Who's with me?
0:37 if the professor doesn't stop flirting with Shane's girlfriend there's gonna be trouble i bet
HES REALLY GONE 😢
Turns out the mantle of The Professor is cursed just like the Defense of the Dark Arts professors in the Harry Potter universe. This cycle repeats in every alternate universe with a student overthrowing the teacher putting all the different professors in the same realm; the Cretaceous period of our earth. Somehow Ryan is the only is the only student who defied his version of the Professor left because all the other have been screwed over by the devil. That was the glitch of this universe. Now there are 12 Professors from 12 different universes all on earth and seeking vengeance on Ryan after spending thousands of years waiting for his birth and watching him fulfill his prophecy sending the final, 13th, Professor to the waiting 12.
Beautiful. Couldn't have asked for a better season.
No one: Sara: “Ex- squeeze?”
"This isn't one of those shows that leaves things unsolved at the end"
“Possess me daddy!” “Ok” “Wait-“
The best video ever!!!!!!!!
So does this mean no more puppet history???
I’m so upset, and for what
What the hell is even that?!!?!!!??
Joker at the end omg
Next season: dinosaur history with the professor!
This is the greatest season finale I’ve seen in recent television history. No it’s true.  Hats off to the whole team holy moly the thought and time behind all this is incredible
Was not expecting that
Nooooooo. What?! Nooooooooo. Genuinely sad, I liked that fuzzy little guy! RYAN WHAT HAVE YOU DONE 😭
As an Austinite I could pass on Whataburger, however, it blows my mind that you hate it. Maybe it's not as good once it got bought by someone from out of state ;)
I can't believe Ryan and Shane rip into the depiction of dead Vision so much all the time but they ended this with a Thanos + Gamora reference.
What had happened!!!
24:13 Sara's reaction to the spiking is the same energy as considering bad traffic on the way to brunch
The true ruthless move was making a tee shirt out of the professor's obituary
I love how one guy once said that the c-dogs thing wasnt funny and they now label it the best bit of the show
NOOOOOOOOOOOO RYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNN!!!!!!!! WHAT DID YOU DOOOOOOOOO!?!?!?!?!?!?! it cost us everythiinnng
Just me of the professor seem a bit pale today?
what in the world did just happen
"you wanna dance with the devil you gotta live with it when he sets you on fire"
thats no demon, its just normal shane XD gotta love the energy
deym dat song is sooo good~
No, the oars! My boys! They were so happy and in love! Christmas was every day because they were travelling the world, they were oars and they were gay! D:
25:40 goddammit! I literally walked by my mom when he did that and she looked at me strange lol thanks 😂😂
Paleontologist: Why did I found a rotten Jelly Bean in this fossil around the stomach
Never thought I'd hear a puppet say "possess me daddy" but here we are
I like how Ryan turned into a clown at the end
Asmodeus was an absolute banger! Totally killer performance. Two enthusiastic thumbs up for that one!
Theory: Ryan turns himself into a puppet to enter a deal with the genie to go back and time travel to catch the Professor as he’s falling right before he gets eaten
What. Just. Happened.
He best not be dead I swear to god, I wish to have that funny little blue man in my life on Fridays
Time for Film Theory to step in and make a collab 😎
@Matpatgt we need you to look at this lore
I was with this until I heard Whataburger get insulted, I’m out. (I’m not even from the south I just worked down there for 9 months and it was the best burger place I’ve ever been to. I miss it so much ;3;)
I liked the video for the asmodeus song.
I guess ryan went full Ricky Goldsworth huh
Thanks, Ryan. Thanks for killing the Professor.
I've been so wrapped up in my own grief that I completely forgot the reaction of Seasoned Champion Kate Peterman when she inevitably returns for the s5 premiere and rIPS RYAN'S HEAD CLEAR OFF HIS SHOULDERS FOR BETRAYING THE PROFESSOR. I hope she uses the power of her combined trophies to take over as TA and stage a rescue
pardon me... huh?
OMG!
WHAT THE FUCK???? NO!!!!!!!!!!! I REFUSE
Sara is the fucking cutest.
Ryan being nice to The Professor should have been our first sign that something was wrong with the timeline
We shouldn't have expected anything normal from the creator of the hot daga
Meanwhile me:  "Right. A demon. Why didn't I think of that straight away? It was SO obvious!"  Uuuugh, Lucifer Magnielle is rolling in his fuckin' throne laughing.
Saras face at 39:50 is my favorite thin literally ever
Can we get a vinyl of all the bangers Shane has written for this series?
I love puppet history so much I'm going to miss it 😭😭😭 but I'm excited for the new season of are you scared its just in time for halloween!!
lol he couldn't handle whataburger lame
Blueberry Bergara🫐
Shane and Sarah are so cute together.
Why does the name asmodue sounds familiar
wow. This whole episode was crazy impressive. Amazing
Ryan fading out with joker paint edited over his face is what I live for 40:59
I'm so sad!!
Ryan offending Texans at 13:30
We need one final season
After this season finale we need the music RIGHT NOW
WHAT. THE. FUCK.
I am possed by...yewtoob
PLEASE don't wait too long before bringing in the next season! This is my favorite show!! 😭😢
They say that the Professor is “canonically dead”... but since when have we ever respected canon?
oh my GOOOOOD! Professor, no!!!
Is no one else going to question why Ryan didn’t say Ricky goldsworth was one of his demons?
Nice, youtube did not recommend this to me. Now I have to ask Ryan's or Sarah's for the notes.
Petition to bring the professor back
"And what did it cost?" "Everything." it had to be an infinity war reference. there was no other way.
Now we need movie posters of all the puppets with the caption of "Avenge the Fallen"
NOOOOOOOOOO ! PROFESSOR !!!!!!!
sara was the love of my life before the ghoul boys where a thing and seeing all at once makes my heart happy
I knew Ryan was being suspicious all season! HOW COULD YOU?!
Is that Shane's girlfriend?
THE MISSED OPPORTUNITY OF NOT PUTTING DOWN RICKY GOLDSWORTH AS YOUR DEMON, RYAN
Why is the RIP picture...FROM WIKIFEET?!?! HAHAHA  er...I mean... uh....nooooo he's gone!
Jaw? Dropped.  Interest? Piqued. Hotel? Trivago.
If this really was the end of the Professor and Puppet History, that’s going to make me really goddamn sad.
Next season?  This is gonna be great
NOOOOO
Bro what is this
They just killed the MC.
So I think the professor gets thrown up by the T-Rex who swallowed him because the T-Rex is puppet intolerant! The professor makes a makeshift God-phone to communicate to discover there is a loop hole to the Devil & Genie’s plot: The wish has to be made from a willing soul. Since the Professor didn’t willfully make the last wish cause he was possessed the wish is nullified, he is sent back to PU theater, & Ryan is extremely riddled with guilt & confessed to the Professor. The Professor forgives Ryan but reminds him that he hasn’t forgotten. Leaving the door open to get Ryan back
this is controversial all im sayin   putting a needle through the... makes me shiver. is that any form of torture?
The whole striking their chest with their heads could just be a tick, kinda like stimming. I did it so release stress when I was little it freaked out my teachers but being double jointed helped in doing it
Is the ASMODEUS song available on spotify tho? It's such a bop.
what did I just watch
Ryan & Shane dynamic duo! Love u guys and the new channel. Your creativity isn’t restrained here.👍👌😊😀✌️🤩
Ryan is definitely using that telephone to God next season to 'phone a friend' out of this mess he made
This is the basis for the movie The Devils with Oliver Reed and Vanessa Redgrave. It's a really cool-looking movie, check it out!
BETRAYAL
Please don't let this be the end of Puppet History. Like, I expect it to be, but Puppet History has literally been one of my favorite series, as was Ruining History back in the day. Even if Professor McNasty is dead, I'd even take lessons from the Devil if they are as interesting as McNasty's were.
I’d like to see a puppet history episode on Lady Flora Hastings from Queen Victoria’s court. I think the professor would do a great job with her story
12:26 cute unique baby names!!
It’s be really funny if in order to get the Professor back, Ryan had to create the PH algorithm that prevented him from the HM award in the first place
RIP The Professor
more like false preisttenses
Ok but why is nobody taking about that unsolved diss
The plot twist though. You didn’t have to go so hard I was already invested in the show !
Honestly, it sounds so horrifying but with Shane and Ryan running the show everything is funny.
41:00 - WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY.
The comments are- they're all fanfictions.
*eyes welling with tears of heartbreak*
LMAOOOO bet shane ass just feel lazy to continue the lore so on next season they can just do the show without keeping doing it. Watch the professor come back again just chilling.
NOOOOOOOO :(
Welp. Bye Professor.  I guess that was dramatic.
I need to know the process of making the songs and stuff cuz this is great
Guyyyyyssss!!!! What if all three answers the professor presents are all alternate timelines that actually happened!!!! He’s been said to meddle with the timeline before so it’s not too unreasonable 👀
Hey, if puppets can shit out jelly beans, stomach acid can spare puppets. I’m sure the professor will make it out of this. It’ll be like DBZ and Ryan will use the third genie wish to get the professor back.  Anyway, I hope ghost stories makes a return between the puppet history seasons.
I’m an occultist and have invoked Asmodeus before. He told me he did it cause he said it’s his way of fun 😂
I never thought Ryan would do it! I hope the hotdaga crew step up and save the professor
I'm not ready for this show to end.
i was just expecting another fun episode. i wasn't expecting to begin grieving for the professor....
I know people are mostly talking about the ending and I don't blame them because, "WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?" but can we talk about the song for a second? How did that slap this hard? I love how Shane experiments with different genres while making these numbers.
He was supposed to go face down in a lazy river in Boca Raton... RIP; unless he Gandalf the White's into a new Professor.
JUST CHANGE YOUR LOGO INTRO
ok but real talk, animators workin overtime, that was impeccable
When you play Obey Me and see Asmodeous singing the song at the end
this episode is so fucking unhinged i love it
WAIT WAIT WAIT HOLD ON I NEED A SECOND OH MY GOD
For all of those who requested no lore… They had to pack a seasons worth of lore into one episode and it killed the Professor.  Are you happy? Is this what you wanted??
Idk what i was expecting but it definitely wasnt the professor dying :c
I cried qnq
can we get the ghoul boys to go on a haunting session at shane dawson's new home?
Canonicly dead until we TIME TRAVEL AND MAKE THIS NEVER HAPPEN BY VIRTUE OF THE ACT OF TIME TRAVELING IN THE FIRST PLACE CHANGING THE TIMELINE PERMANANTLY LETS GOOO
This is so, SO much more than I ever thought it was going to be. I was so confused by the comments (I thought there was going to be an announcement about something at the end?), but now that I watched it, I'm so fucking enthralled.  (spoiler for end)   Also, the little bit with Ryan and Sarah at the end, on top of the implication Ryan was part of the whole getting rid of the Professor for a trophy... So exciting!  Cannot wait to see what Shane has in store!
WHATABURGER IS A GODSEND, HOW DARE YOU?
NOOOOOO WHAT??? AHHH
I refuse to believe he’s dead because that would make me sad. 😤
To quote Sarah here....”EXQUEEZE?!”
Listen DO NOT DO THIS TO ME! PLEASE TELL ME THE PROFESSOR IS DOING OK IN THAT TREX'S TUMMY!
"A skeleton was reported to have wandered the halls" I mean, technically every time someone wanders through a set of halls, there's a skeleton wandering. you just can't see it. maybe someone was just getting a little silly with their journaling
FIRST GENE WHO IS FRENCH FRIES AND NOW THE PROFESSOR 😩
Ok but that song slaps. Lol. This was so great.
Theory: After this episode, Ryan turns to his friend, Shane, for advice. Shane is friends with the Genie - they met in hell, where Shane was king and the Genie was his most trusted adviser - and so Shane introduces the Genie to Ryan. Ryan asks the Genie to turn back time so that Ryan can prevent himself from making a grave (pun intended) mistake - this is the nexus event that causes the Professor and the Genie to meet for the first time in the meta-timeline. This starts the Genie-Professor game of chase through time, and causes the Professor to experience different histories as they happen. The Professor, therefore, always starts Puppet History, and the different branches of time always end up here - in this episode. There’s now a time loop, where the Professor always meets his end, Ryan always regrets his decision, the Genie must continue his Sisyphean task of chasing the little blue puppet through time, and Shane watches on from where he’s sat atop his satanic throne. This should keep him entertained for a good century or so.
If he’s been time traveling then that means theoretically there are multiple Professors at different points in time all existing simultaneously. So what if one version of the professor finds out what happens from Sarah and then uses his still existing time travel powers to trick the genie and the devil as revenge and gets his show back? And better yet the “new” genie can be slightly different that our recently deceased blue dude, and thus same character different actor if Shane is wanting to move on artistically
listening to Ashely flowers so i already know all the answers professor 😎       edit: RYAN???????????????????????????????????????????
ARE YOU HAPPY RYAN ARE YOU HAPPY YOU KILLED THE PROFESSOR NOW WHO WILL TEACH ABOUT NOW WHO ,WHO IM VERY MAD AT YOU!!FOR SHAME
just what the fuck, i loved it, but what
How come no one is wondering y Ryan did mention Ricky Gold as one of his demons? (Or was it Goldsworth?)
What would be funny is if the Watcher channel just moved along and did another holiday special like nothing happened. ;)
YOU HAVE TO STOP CREATING SHOWS THAT I LOVE DEARLY AND THEN SNATCHING THEM AWAY FROM ME. It’s cruel.
WHY DID I JUST FIND THIS CHANNEL IM IN LOVE
I wasnt ready for the absolute power ballad
I am so, so glad you guys have your own company. Shane got to put history and lore AND A PLOT in his puppet history show. I love it.   Also I wish Horrible Histories was still a thing so The Professor could guest star in it or something.
Its over? That was to fast!! Season 5!!
Professor!!!!! Noooooo D;
Ooooh I love "The Devils" (1971)
I saw “character puppet” for sale on Amazon and it looked an awful lot like the professor… he might wanna check in on that
are we just gonna ignore the fact that they used wikifeet for the professer's photo???
Is Ryan on new meds or just great weed, because this new season Ryan is so off for me. Him being so passive and nice like this makes me feel uncomfortable. I feel like some people were nagging that he always seemed mean, so they made him nicer, but it was their shtick. This season is just not hitting the same way as the ones in the past did, which is extra sad since they are back to in person shows now, something we've all been missing.
If time travel exists then no one can truly be canonically dead. Because I do not accept it.
In shock and in awe of this finale, for sure. maybe it's a setup for puppet history but during the stone age, who knows? the possibilities are endless—the professor is probably gonna jonah his way out of that dinosaur, one way or another ----------- but the animation of those nuns and their arms going buck wild look like they're...voguing. and honestly, i'm living for it. yasssss
I wonder what extent of this historic batshitiness is just schizophrenia and other mental illnesses? ....NVM it's all just slander against other people.
...okay.
I mean, we all knew it was going to happen, but damn.
A Hallowe'en "'Too Many Spirits" would be awesome
“Phosphorus fucked here” 11:48 I love this bit
What a great ending
at the time 8:21 in the Mansa Musa puppet history video the professor says “maybe at some point i’ll transform into an exciting new version of myself” INDICATING THAT THE PROFESSOR ISNT ACTUALLY DEAD HES JUST GONNA TRANSFORM
Ryan. What happened to not messing with demons? I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed.
Rip the professor
WHAT DOES IT MEAN
No, wait I just realized.   Spoilers  The whole reason the Professor died was because of the Devil.  The only way he can be saved is if Ryan finds a way to beat the Devil and the genie.   The best way to beat the Devil is to either exorcise or weaken their power by using faith against them or  LOSING YOUR FAITH IN THEM.   This whole fucking show was just a long con for Shane to get Ryan to admit demons aren't real
“What was the first one again?”
Blasphemy about Whataburger!!!!!
Since we’re talking theories, here’s mine: The Professor said that he’d love to have a Gandalf the Grey to Gandalf the White arc. I think his return will be something similar, where he’s back but technically different
Uh, I'm sorry, say what now? "Canonically dead"???
YALL GOTTA TALK ABT ZODIAC NOW
NO THE PROFESSOR!
I need to hear ALL THE COVERS of this one. Especially punk and ska.
Just opening with EMDR for Ryan and his demon trauma I see
i like her shoes
The Asmodeuos song has no business being that catchy XD
Please bring another season!
okay shane calling his wife “my moon and stars” through the tiny puppet is making me emotional
Well that was close
People today: scared of possessions People back then: "yeehaw finally some fucking entertainment around here! good shit. hey lady, whirl your head!"
My username for legit everything is Loundu tho-   Am- Am I...?
WTFFFFFF
Y'all, I highly recommend going back and watching the whole season after watching this episode because the amount of DETAIL and FORESHADOWING is AMAZING! Like there are so many tiny things, even in the puppet songs that you just kinda gloss over and then after watching the finale it ALL MAKES SENSE.  Art. True art. Silly art, but art none the less. Well done, boys.
Oooo now this is a season finale I'm excited for the season premiere!!
The foreshadowing by ryan is all through this episdoe
What the flip did you do ryan!?
I love how everybody suddenly scrambles for the whiteboard as they realize they have to write something down. That was so funny.
ok so that bit about there not being any lore this season is a lie
Not our beloved Whataburger!
Wait, when did Elmo get his speech impediment worked out!?!
Me: What a neat song! My sleep paralysis: You rang?
Sometimes I think the professor is more Shane than Shane himself
Are you telling me that there's not gonna be another season of puppet history??? Come on bro!! Bring the professor back. I'm learning here. Lol
I'm really glad I didn't read any comments until after the video.
I’m sad you didn’t talk about the eight wonder of the world jeff the mongoose
Ugh… noo!
BANGER AT THE END??
Ryan’s the joker confirmed??
I'm stunned.
I like Shane and Sara they both seems to be a skeptic. but Sara seems to be extra skeptic. like, vegan level skeptic.
I love how everyone is freaking out and sad that the Professor is “dead.” When In the first episode of this season he said “But the big take away here, at the end of this season, everything will be precisely as it was in this very moment.” I’m betting it’s all a nightmare the prof had or  the best dream Ryan had. 😂🤣😢
ok but when is watcher gonna drop an album of these songs 🔥🔥
Love this as I always love Puppet History, and thanks so much for the warning about lights, very much appreciated. Also, please tell me this isn't the end of my favourite fuzzy blue guy
Man I was depressed AF when Shane and Ryan announced the end of their BuzzFeed journey, and I thought they were leaving YouTube altogether. So glad I'm wrong.
Ryan's impersonation of Dracula was spot on 🧛🏾‍♂️
im with sara here lmaoo i would honestly chill with them, instead of making them angry
NGL, the professor listing demon names made me very uncomfy. Rule of thumb: never ever say the names of demons out loud. It draws them. D:
Please don't end puppet history. Please 🥺🥺🥺
There's no fucking way my mans is dead, I will fucking sob if he doesn't come back next season, he better have tore his fucking way out of the T-rex & is working on a time machine cuz if he's for sure dead I can't handle
So nice to unwind and watch your videos after so many exams 🥰❤️
When will you go on a field trip?!!
PROFESSOR oh nooooo! 😭😭😭
Bring back the Professor. >:[[[
So we’re all on the same page that Shane Madej is the worlds most underrated genius right?
I always knew this was going to be Ryan’s villain origin story
“Ladies and gentlemen…France.” 💀
The professor is going to come back right, he’s the only little guy I love and care about
The rewatch value on this video is INSANE
“the needles go in the sack we pull on back” -one of the nuns probably
what shoes is ryan wearing?
You didn't have to use the WIKIFEET watermark, but you did.
POV: your name is Alex 👁👄👁
WIKIFEET??????
12:24 Ryan's reaction is great
if Ryan doesn't collect all 7 dragon balls and Wish the Professor back to Life, i'm going to be upset
I like how the picture of the professor at the end had a wiki feet watermark.
wtf just happened
no
RIP professor. You will be missed
That song was so great!! We need a five track demo now!
Excuse me what
the way i’m genuinely distressed by the death of a puppet
gotta love that they had to raid the professor's wikifeet page to get a picture
top ten anime betrayals of all time
( 22:21 - 22:25 ) My favorite quote by professor EVER  Edit: ⚠️ SPOILER WARNING ⚠️  The professor better *canonically* revive himself!
PROFESSOR !!!!
As this is the final season of Buzzfeed Unsolved: Supernaturals, I am here to check out their new channel since I am going follow Ryan and Shane.
I just realized that we're all so preoccupied with the Professor being canonically dead, that we've overlooked his implication of having been possessed by demons at some point.
next season, Ryan finds another genie to turn him into a puppet so he can travel through history to find one of the versions of the professor to bring him back, and in the end he returns the cup to the professor and apologizes, but the professor says, "No Ryan, this time, you earned it"
So many parallels to the Salem Witch Trials. Teen girls really needed an outlet.
WHY WAS THE PROFESSORS PIC AT THE END FROM WIKI FEET 😭😭😭
yo shane. ryan. what the fuck my dudes
Oh no, the Professor is dead?!
No! No no no no no no! Not like this...
IM SORRY WHEN THE PROFESSOR SAID “SARAH MY MOON AND STARS” I CANT BREATHE IM SHAKING AND CRYING
THIS SEASON FINALE REALLY MAKING ME CRY HUH BRO IM BAWLING
no because i go to one of the catholic schools that the ursuline nuns founded, i will be bringing this up in my religion class
This is like losing Gene all over again.
Next season is just gonna be a zoom call of the professor in the crustacean period
The real demon 😈 which possesses Ryan is named...  👉 RICKY GOLDSWORTH 👈
CANONICALLY DEAD!? NO
Wait, I'm dumb y'all. Does this mean Watcher is ending Puppet History?? Have Ryan and Shane said anything on social media about it? They did call it the season finale but not the series finale? Am I the only one who's confused?
wish i had musical talent, so I could form a shoegaze band called 'a recently diseased french saint'
Yooooo, this story inspired the 1970's horror movie The Witches starring Vanessa Redgrave as a very sexually charged, repressed and devillishly "possessed" nun (caution: the movie's kinda disturbing but the set design and costumes are amazing.)
A series of substitute teachers show up in the next season and ryan must prove that he can become a history master the proper way, and he can harness the power of beans through the trophy to open a portal to bring fuzzy britches back
Random guy: the possessions were fake guys  Some priest: ratio
This is amazing 👍
Yo I can't be the only one watching Buzzfeed absolutely SCRAMBLE to maintain the popularity of unsolved . . . What do you guys think about the newer unsolved vids?
Are we not going to discuss this insanity
Not the Professor! Can we send the rest of the puppets after Ryan?
Possess me daddy! 😂
you know, i really wanted Ryan to win... but at what cost...
The devils 1971
I need this songs on spotify, tbh
This is,,, just a SEASON finally right??
No.. I'm sad, how are we already on the season finale.  I wonder if the Nuns made this all up, because they heard about what he was doing and was like, this guy Grandier is doing bad deeds we need to do something about this. Then one of the Nuns was like I have an idea and just started acting all demon possessed and got all the other nuns to go along with it, as if they really wanted him to get the town to get rid of him.
RIP Professor 🙏
some of those nuns had to be lesbians i think like come on ladies, what a perfect place to be 😇
F*** Ryan's opinion of What-a-burger
HHahaha I KNEW IT!! Beef boy was way too nice ahahahaha bruh they’re the best
This is like killing off Elmo and I emotionally cannot handle it
I KNEW IT I KNEW IT RYAN WAS IN IT!!!!
Please bring back too many spirits!!
The production value God damn 🙌
Father jean-joseph surin laid down of the pentagram of the nunnery and shouted “let’s rock n roll buckaroo”
So is Ryan going to have to go on a whole timetraveling adventure to save The Professor, with guest star historical figures to guide him?
Noooooooooooooo
Ryan and the Professor! A worse betrayal the Nate and Ted
Ryan went from being terrified of that wimpy ass sallie house demon to working alongside the devil and a demon prince. Growth 🌱❤
Your*
Does that mean there won't be any new seasons of Puppet History? 😞
Dang so that's the end of puppet history
If the professor isn't back next season I will burn the world to the ground
NOOOOO I really hope there are more seasons of puppet history :((( its so good!!
We need Mat pat to do a video on this
What demons are haunting you……ur mom
THIS IS WHY WE DONT DANCE WITH THE DEVIL IN THE PALE MOONLIGHT RYAN
Um. Okay. No. The Professor cannot be dead. Right? RIGHT?! HELP
Wait this isn’t the goddamn Finale finale, is it? The professor didn’t just get EATEN BY A TYRANNOSAUR, FUCKING DID HE????  THIS ISNT THE FUCKING END OF PUPPET HISTORY, IS IT?!!!!!!
No!! The professor isnt really dead is he? This has GOT to be a joke. He wont come out in the dinosaurs poop, he cant be digested! So he's alive. Right? Tell me he's alive.
The Wikifeet watermark over the professor's picture lmao
Bwhahahah aha I wasn't expecting that
WAIT A SECOND, does this mean no more Puppet History?! Oh Ryan!
WHAT
I was so ready to hear Ryan say he was possessed by Ricky Goldsworth
What was the COST… DID YOU THINK OF THE COST
I just started bingeing this show and now The Professor is canonically dead? NOOOOOoooooooo!
Someone please tell me the professor planned for this and has like secret clones of himself who will set out to avenge their creator
Theory: the molasses horse is going to help the professor excape hell
Giving it a dislike just because I hate the ending
Nosfuratu was turning the lights on and off
I love Sara on this show
I love Sara so much 😂😂 I’m crying laughing
Wtf
There’s a banned film about this!
RIP to a real one 😔❤
Sorta spoiler for end of the episode ………….      “Episode pitch puppet genie has trapped professor in another dimension, we get the purple genie puppet for an episode quizzing ryan and whoever on acts he’s done to the professor throughout time”.   I wrote that on the Richest Man Episode, i’m counting it as a win
Did you guys really just use a scientifically accurate T. Rex? I’m impressed
Um, nope I am not okay with this. There better be a season 5 because I love this show too much 😭😭😭
what a finale! i really hope the jellybeans play a significant role next season. perhaps with satan being the adversarial host, ryan has to compete to win as many jellybeans as possible to garner enough time travel residue (since the jellybeans are from the professor who was magically endowed with time travel abilities) to travel back in time and save the professor. and if there aren't any jellybeans left (as alluded to this ep) maybe next season will have all returning players since they were awarded jellybeans and ryan will have to compete with them to win. it would make ryan needing to win each episode crucial and really raise the stakes. it would be a good upping the ante from "ryan finally wins an episode" to "yeah he finally won an episode but now he literally has to win all of them so this singular win means nothing anymore". can't wait for next season! the lore sprinkled throughout this show is so fun!
AHHHH WHEN IS THE NEXT SEASON?!
THIS WAS CRAZYYY
Bravo! Stands in living room clapping at TV.
DEEP. LORE
Wtf happened to “B Boiis” this ep?!?! Sarah can hang!?
Y’all outdid yourself. Streamies for everyone.
Amazing finale guys
How's he supposed to cover the Pig War of 1858 now?!
ryan hoow could youuu #savetheprofessor
Wait… didn’t the molasses horse warn us about Asmodeus 😀
Really love this series, maybe I’m taking this twist too seriously.  Looking forward to the next season!
This is the best season finale hahaha such a nice cliffhanger!
Oh my. Oh My.
So...is this a Season Finale or a Series Finale?
Headbanging nuns sound metal AF
Bring back Ruining History..
WHAT
Yes YES Shane's masterpiece HotDaga level writing is showing. I thought I would never see this day.
Can anyone tell me at which times the flashing lights are? I really appreciate the warning at the start, and I would like to watch the video anyway
why is no one talking about the wikifeet watermark over the professors remembrance picture 😭
PROFESSOR LOOK OUT FOR THE  DINOSAUR NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
PROFESSOR LOOK OUT FOR THE DINOSAUR NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
They brought cloistered nuns in public to exorcise them? That’s so messed up.
Excuse me. How could you?! IS2G if you don’t bring him back right now I will unsubscribe!
1.25x the song so good
Aw the genie crashed the propeller's party and turned all the puppets into just a normal snowman, oar, wolf, etc. 39:27
What
If I don't see a zombie Professor next season I'm rioting.
Plot twist: Ryan does a puppet show but make it unsolved
Ricky Goldsworth looking at Ryan's list: impossible, perhaps the archives are incomplete
Best episode till date full stop end of discussion😂
"R.I.P. He's history"
Rest in piss
Hey, I only showed up because Leviathan said there would be Pizza at the convent!
Man, I want to be a guest contestant. Yes please to subscriber specials.
But- is the professor ok, I refuse to believe he’s dead😭
Noooo the professor... I'm seriously misty eyed over a blue furry half foot tall  puppet... wtf
holy shit
the pic of the professor at the end with the wikifeet watermark is so fucking funny i'm upset
You know, supernatural also had characters that were dead in canon, but came back.... ( maybe I just have trust issues)
A million years ago I failed history at school and I really was not a fan of it, but I'm having so much fun with this series and genuinely enjoy learning about history thanks to it. However I did not expect this to culminate in me nearly crying over a puppet
OH NO WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN NOW 😨
At least if the professor gets outta this one he'll have to undergo some character development
Canonically dead?!😭
NOOOOOOOOOOO PROFFESOOOOOORRR NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Shane I really appreciate the effort you put into this!
Um no I’m sorry what
wai- uh excu- HANG ON A MOMENT!!!
asmodeus is ironically on the same musical tier as god
The editing!!😂  And the whole overarching plot line is so good!  I hope we see the professor make a comeback next season. :)
I loved Ken russels the devils such a good movoe
I was not expecting an abundance of lore as a season finale.
I. Am. Defeated. History dealt me a blow I cannot nor will not recover. Why you gotta do me dirty, Puppet History—I tell everybody to watch and now… I shall weep myself to sleep tonight.
"they're making a mockery of the science"  Beef-boy "Ryan" talking about people seeing skeletons walking around a church.
We need a Puppet History: The Movie in which Ryan saves the Professor by traveling back in time and in the end Professor makes him Grand History Master.
You do this now, how dare you?!
Wait.... there's going to be another season right??? This is my favorite show on the internet
I saw that Gnommish letter within the demonic runes 👀
“possess me daddy”
"Ladies and gentlemen... FRANCE."
I need another season after what just happened
Please tell me theres a season 5
Me defeating the gay accusations
professor i miss you already. can't wait for the season 5 trailer!
I feel like this was just Münchausen syndrome. They were so obsessed with constantly getting attention that they hurt themselves and lied about being possessed to get it. That or they were extremely committed to the bit
Ryan is actually the professor's origin; he will shortly track down the genie, wish for the power of time travel in hopes of finding the professor and bringing him back to a safer time period, but the genie will at the same time turn him into a puppet. While searching through history for the professor, Ryan will gradually lose the memory of his human life, forget what started him on this journey, and complete the time loop by becoming his own teacher, and picking on a student who for some reason triggers a self-loathing instinct deep within his new little blue heart.
WIKI FEET
7:07 it’s like that purple pigeon gif, I love it XD
Great now I'm crying over a puppet
Are top 5 beatdown or are you scared coming back?
Why the hell am I crying?
Wait.....wait.....what just happened??? Why did it say RIP at the end??  That's not for real...........IS IT?!?!
Do the history of Dionysus and the resultant cults of dionysus up until they became the christian church.
Lol the Unsolved shade 🤣
So is this the end of Puppet History or is the next season going to be headlined by Ryan's new boss?
I was only going to leave a comment saying how beautiful the final scene's graphics where, then realized the RIP Professor pic has a the watermark of wikifeet and now I can think of nothing else
What happens if he poops a jelly bean into the T-rex's tummy?  I mean, we've all seen what they do to humans.
I just realized Ryan’s smile looks like Miguel Almaguer from NBC News
i haven’t finished the ep yet but i’m already upset over the whataburger slander edit: okay now i’ve finished the ep and i’m crying
*is gravely concerned*
I would genuinely listen to this song on repeat
NOOO THE PROFFESER
Jeff Lynne is very proud of you, Shane!
The Professor: canonically dead  Fanfic writers: nah we don’t do canon
If this get hot daga’d I’ll be crushed— THE LORE MUST CONTINUE PLEASE
no more puppet history?
So this what shane been doing
GG to the best show on the channel. R.I.P. Too Many Spirits Is fun at lest.
ryan better personally invent a time machine and get the professor or I'm literally going to go feral
i am now convinced that ryan is haunted by ragnarok from soul eater now
I thought Asmodeus was the lust demon?
"If something's canonical, it follows a principle or rule, usually in a religious or church-related situation. It is also used in mathematics, music and can refer to something reduced to its most basic form."  -The Internet
XD That was hilarious! This season was such a great time & and this song is straight up fire :D Not to mention all of the extra animation, Thank you everyone at watcher for such a great time <3
. Am I crying over a puppet? Yes. Does the professor need to be restitched and made alive again like in Big hero 6. Also yes.
I'm sad and surprised Ryan didn't write Shane as one of his demons 😂
I loved everything about this episode! From the actual topic of the episode to the Professor/Genie lore, all the way to the deep cut Avengers Infinity War Thanos Easter Egg! Well done! 👏🏾
So we're gonna have a dinosaur themed season 5 huh?
he's not dead 😠
Ryan … you sold out The Professor ?? What… what ???? A dinosaur 🦕??? … he deserved more than that … smh !!!
I want to watch Kate watch this !!! She would go ape shit !!! ❤️ Kate !!! ✌🏻❤️
R.I.P my favorite Watcher series.
Watching the episode again, I feel like there was just subtle foreshadow to what Ryan was scheming for the end 😂
Oh my freaking heart </3
Damn! They got a hit with that song
Is anyone else upset Ryan didn’t mention Goldsworth possessing him?
Not the thanos line omg
Jeez Ryan I know that the Professor was kind of a bias asshole but that's going too far.
I have a TARDIS you could borrow.
Noooooo professors
Also Ryan you better Get the Prof back. you better.
........................................ HOLY S@$%!!!!!
Was this the series finally?
Honestly I genuinely forget that Shane is behind these videos. The Professor is a real person to me. I don’t think I’ll ever recover from this.
I've watched this like 4 or 5 times in the past 2 days. It's still too intense for a youtube channel. I'm way too invested in the professor's welfare. This had better not be the last but rather the climactic prequel to more epic seasons ahead. Not ready to let go of this perfect series.  (Side note: I can only imagine the amount of planning, creativity, research, and hard work these episodes take out of the team. Major props to everyone working on Puppet History. It's a true gem of the internet.)
I'm just unreasonably excited to see Sara's Dr Dog shirt <3
Nunspringa!! Love it
I think this is the most impressive puppet yet!
If there's a next season, you should definitely cover the Canudos War in Brazil.
also can we talk about the sfx
I...I can't believe how crushed I feel knowing that the professor is canonically dead. Why have you done this to us.
👏🏻👏🏻 We can only hope that some of us make such a bizarre impact that hundreds/thousands of years from now, maybe we don't end up in history books, but some nerd growing up on the ISS 3000 will make a fun, educational trivia show about us too And Shane will be there, possessing the nerd
So when does supernatural season 7 come out??
the puppets just keep getting better every season
The Whataburger hate from Ryan was scariest part of this story
Now wait, just a minute!!
Omg!! I.....i....  LOVED IT!
Should NOT have watched that one with my conservative Christian parents…
Ryans gf is so funny
Love the Thanos/Gamora reference
NOOOOOOOOOO I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS HOW IT ENDS. I'm gonna miss this show so much 😭
OMG…..what did I just watch?!?
Professor gonna have some cool stories to tell
NOT THE CLOWN MAKEUP
SARA RUBIN, MY MOON AND STARS
I never realized that was Shane's girlfriend.
ryan's mind: you got the trophy but at what price? ryan: idk
Ok, so, I get it, there are bigger things happening here, but are we not going to discuss how the professor's photo at the end was watermarked by wikifeet???  Where's the friggin lore on THAT???
puppet history is slowly but surely becoming an ARG which is probably the last thing I expected but like, totally here for it
how they gonna bring back the professor after that one?
wtf
I loved how the song repeated 6 three times...hilarious and subtle XD
:( this was heartbreaking lol  but that song was banging!
I’m going to need you to warn me about an upcoming warning ⚠️
"POSSESS ME DADDY"  Wow.
THE PROFESSOR IS DEAD AND IM CRYING
If you could expand this to, oh, I don't know, 90 minutes or so, you could have a blockbuster. Think about it.
Give these guys Oscar. DiCaprio take notes from Ryan Bergara. Drama at its finest..
"a black dodgeball just fuckin up nuns"
Is the series over? I love the professor and all the puppets with their songs.
YOU TAKE IT BACK YOU FUCKERS!! HE CAN’T BE DEAD!!!!
was not expecting to hear david s pumpkins 😳
So what does this mean for the show?  Did they run out of history to tell?
It’s literally a puppet and I’m still upset
Wait...does this mean the professor, if alive, could change history?
A-S-M-O-D-E-U-S just HAS to be the strongest performance since the Gem Rap nobody could change my mind
ok but like ryan forgot about ricky goldsworth!
Wait, is there gonna be more. ):
If that fluffy-wuffy Lil puppet isn't brought back next season un-harmed I'm going to send Ryan a VERY stern email!
Time travel....you know who else could time travel? That's right, beloved character Gene.
No! Not our beloved host, The Professor!
Hey, is it me, or was the Horse trying to warn the Professor, and us, about what was going to happen to our favourite History Professor?
idk if anyones mentioned this, but there's a movie made in 1971 based off this called The Devils, and it was banned at the time for its sensitive content lol
It's about time Sara was featured on this show 😂
This better be leading up to an epic crossover in the series finale for Buzzfeed Unsolved or I am going to LOSE IT
So........I'm really hoping that the professor gets pooped out of the T-rex intact and somehow comes back to life. 😳
i hope the next season the Professor comes riding in on the T-Rex he tamed
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA Thanos and Gamora exchange and Mephisto! 😂😂😂
I knew Ryan was gonna do something haha
You’re. Fucking. Joking.
also rip
bro wtf
Damn, rip to a real one
Can someone make Sara face a GIF already
nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnoOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
woah woah woah woah… where do we go from here…
😥😥😥😥😥😥
Yo wait wtf did the perdedor just die for good wtf?
Now let's get into the theories behind this week's Buzzfeed case: The dissaperance of The Professor. Theory number one: students have reported seeing the presence of a demon and a genie right before he went missing. Was foul play involved? Did this have anything to do with The Professor?
Anyone else truly traumatized by the ending?!
Whataburger doesn't like you inside of it either, Ryan. The secret is to drown everything in spicy ketchup.
is this... the end?
That Was EPIC!!!
These were my comfort videos
Soooooo we’re not getting season 5? Or is Elmo gonna teach-I need to class for a credit so
The Wikifeet watermarked photo was a true tribute
Was it worth it Ryan? You murdered the patron saint of puppets, jellybeans, and dunking on your friends.
This was incredible
41:32 Wait the Professor is dead? How are they going to make a Season 3 then?
THATS WHY YOU DONT DANCE WITH THE DEVIL GOD DAMMIT RYAN
WATCHIN THIS STONED WAS THE BEST IDEA.
Man, Asmo really went through a glow up since Obey Me
the professor explaining the mysteries of historical people so very succinctly: TRAUMA SUCKS.
WAIT WHAT? NOOOOOOOOO! PLEASE TELL ME THIS ISN'T THE END OF PUPPET HISTORY
you know what's a sin? these songs not being on streaming platforms
POSSESS ME DADDY
OK, I'm genuinely upset. Come back, Professor....
I'm so glad Ryan finally won <3
Sarah was right they were definitely jealous. after going through all of that getting fake witnesses and fake evidence, they just say that a demon is in something conveniently used to sleep with other people.... okay sure 🤣
"canonically dead" okay yeah SURE
Noooooooo! Not the Perfessor! Boogara, I feel your need for the trophy, but you gotta find a way to wish the Prof back. I still haven't met him in person! How can I hug him if he's in a dinosaur? I don't want to hug fossilized coprolite! 👻
24:55 “Ladies and gentlemen, F R A N C E”
RIP Professor
HHUH
YOU DID NOT
Little bit of gossip for the Professor:            You didn’t hear this from me, a little birdie told me that Ryan might actually be a genie. 🤫
Poor Professor T-T
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO MY FAVORITE BLUE MAN RYAN??????????????/
The editors had a feild day with the ending song in this one
Professor better Jonah and the whale that shit, because if he ain’t alive inside that T-Rex I’m going to ugly cry
It really just sounds like a group of free-thinking ladies who didn't conform to the church and were attempted to be brought back in line. The first curing was probably her just playing along to get them to leave, then after was just done with the church's shit. hell from early on they could have just used the cover of a nunery and the church to have a refuge for women from persecution
Lots of 4th wall brakes ryan taking about demons  the Professor Said This is not one of those lame shows  that leaves stuff unsolved
Professor cant be dead. I need more content!!! lol
"Sarah Ruben, my moon and stars!" i LOVE it
R.i.p Professor
Man this is an awesome season finale.
AHHH I CANT BELIEVE THEY EDITED CLOWN MAKEUP ONTO RYAN IM SCREAMING
There are several things that could have been bothering these nuns, and if we asume the first woman wasn’t faking then even if we asume only one other one was sick we come to several water and food illnesses and pathogens that cause these symptoms, so considering the religious services at the time washing of water of the poor peoples feet was a thing and the nuns washed their own often beginning with the oldest nun ending with the youngest converts. This is just ONE way that this could have happened.  Food borne illnesses also come into play… making this complex because nuns grew lots of their own food but also received donations of meat and fish and usually bread and waifers…   Sooooo then we get into parasites   I could go on but no one wants to hear this honestly. I’m pretty sure these women and many people in history with behavior like this were truly ill and needed medical treatment that would not be available for hundreds of years
My will to live died just as canonically as the professor 😩
“Watch what you say, Marques” the genie is coming for MKBHD
Wait so this is the series finale? It was a good run guys!!
SCREAM the clown makeup on ryan sldkfsldkjfa;'gdhfjs
Shane was never a demon, guys! He was a Jinn all along!
F
the wikifeet watermark has me crying RIP The Professor
excuse me WHAT HW WHYYY WHAT THE FUCK
The Asmodeus song sounds like a hidden Queen song
You know what I'm sure he'll be fine. Yeah he's dead but I'm sure he'll get better, he's a puppet.
How can I summon Mr. Genie and wish the Professor back to life and back to this timeline? I'm gonna miss the sarcastic blue fuzzball ;-;
me before the episode: i hope they do an episode on hannukah this year like they did last year for christmas! me now: *D:*
You watch your mouth about Whataburger Mr Ryan
Can't say that I wasn't expecting Ryan to be up to some shenanigans. Although, I also can't say that I expected the Prof to become a dinosaur's snack.
Even father calm got demoned?? Dang.
damn. at least that song fucked
Can we cancel the ghost shows and just do more puppet shows ? Please
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Can we get a multiuniverse puppet history where the professor is still alive
I'm not able to rewatch anything now...now that I know the Professor is, is, is⚰️
i’m sorry. WHAT
I am Actually devastated
I’m so disappointed that neither Ryan nor Sara put Shane’s name on their demon board
RIP Professor McNasty You were the real one
He may be dead in canon, but in this world fanon rules supreme
The professor!!
Nooo Professor! :( Is this the finale of Puppet History as a whole? :(
31:52  The shade 😳
Every one on the show thinks that the nuns enjoyed the attention, but I don’t think that was true back then it would have been humiliating for them to be shown as a Spectacle. The city probably forced them to do the exorcisms publicly so they could get tourist attraction money. And they probably forced those sisters to say that it was the young hot priest because they wanted to get rid of him. So the sisters felt bad when they realized that he was probably going to die because they named him. And when the one sister went on a tour of France to just show everyone that they didn’t need to worry about the sisters anymore. And showed them her hand being like Jesus, Mary, Joseph and recent saint saved them. Or something like that.
This is probably the fanciest season finale we have had, the production value must've been off the roof when you got the t-rex hired from Jurassic Park. Also that image overlay of Ryan as the joker lol
FIRST BORUTO AND NOW THIS!!!!  Why is everyone disneying us!!!!!
i will miss you professor macnasty. Ryan... pls make a wish for the professor to come back.
R.i.p professor, we Will hold a ceremony here in Sweden! ❤
NOOOOOOOOOOO! PROFESSOR!!!!!!!!
I don’t blame Ryan. Professor brought this on himself. But Ryan now has a responsibility to fix it.
how many hotdogs did it take goldsworth  how many
ok I need help. The part of the song that goes ASMODEUS HIS UNHOLINESS, reminds me of a Bob Dylan song and I cannot figure out which song and it is driving me crazy. Please help.
For realsies though-  is there going to be another season of Puppet History? I love this show
This is a lot like the Salem witch trials. People faking affliction and blaming people they didn’t like or approve of with witchcraft. One of my ancestors noted it was ridiculously obvious it was a political plot, and the people of Salem were so upset they had him stand on a chair while they questioned him. Anyway bro escaped Salem and stayed away till it died down.
What happens when a professor pulls a Gandalf the White? Tenure?
Next season on Puppet History: Ryan is slumped on his chair, distraught, incapable of forming any cohesive sentences. The scene is derelict, the stage is slowly crumbling, and Ryan is unwashed and tattered... Each week, Ryan is visited by a new special guest History Master who acts as a proxy therapist, trying to coax Ryan out of his depression. Ultimately, despite multiple cartoon retellings, creatively orchestrated musical numbers, and a metric tonne of jellybeans, Ryan is doomed to spend an eternity in a regretful state, clutching tightly the coveted cup as tears trickle down his meek face.
looooool
RIP professor. we'll miss ur feet
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT ENDING?! WHAT?!
Upon rewatch, the signs were all there…
I miss Shane's weird or messed up history episodes
Man what if the host for season 5 is just the devil
I love Shane speaking German xD
**cut to Ryan waking up**
We better get another series
Noooooooooooo my sweet puppet professor baby 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😭😭😭😭😭
i really hope this series continues somehow. a different subject perhaps, i know history is only so long.
As a photosensitive viewer I greatly appreciate that u guys marked the video with warnings. However could you maybe put timestamps in the description of when these moments occur? So that photosensitive people like me can simply skip them ❤️
R.I.P to the best professor ever. Do we get revenge now or until Ryan learns a real lesson?
Why can you only like a video once?
As far as season finales go, I'd say this was:   THE BEST ONE EVER IN THE HISTORY OF SEASON FINALES!!!!
A S M O D E U S
Oh he turned all the puppets back into just stuff
Maybe the next series of buzzfeed unsolved supernatural they will make contact with the professor?
#hotnunsummer
Oh no. That escalated quickly.
but at what cost
THEY CANT END LIKE THIS!!! THEY HAVE TO SAVE THE PROFESSOR!!
“Ex-sqeeeze?!” I about died 😂
Good for you Ryan. Been rooting for you for the last two seasons
Well that happened
Puppet history is my comfort show for depressive episodes, so I am not afraid to admit I fucking cried like a baby when the professor died
I had already suspected lore ever since the first time Professor has brought up the genie choices. But DAMNNNN I didn't expect this.  Now get me the genie I'M GONNA WISH THE PROFESSOR BACK TO LIFE 😤😤😤
We’ve lost so many loved ones the past two years, Watcher, so WHY TAKE THE PUPPET FROM ME TOO??
oh my god NO he cant be dead! T.T
Professor: Ryan are you with us? Ryan: *POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER INTENSIFIES*
Guys first Unsolved and now the Professor??? How will I get my fixxxx
i’m crying over a god damn puppet
omg
Dear God ryan what have you done
Sara 🖤
sarah providing the exposition for us i love her
fuck you Ryan i loved till you turned your back on Shane i mean the professor.
Fun little fact, Asmodeus is the demon of lust
the watermark at the end killed me xDDD
priest: "the power of christ compels you!" the nun: "does it? does it really? guess what...its not that compelling."
The acting is great. I hope we get a season 5
Ryan is going to have to answer to his Watcher crew and business partners Shane and Steven for dispensing with the host of one of Watcher's most if not thee most popular show.
I'm crying right now. RYAN, HOW CAN YOU DO THIS? 🤦🏻‍♀️😭💀
“Ryan, ready your sample-sized bottle of Holy Water” 💀
just when i think i can rest, i see SARAH 🤢
Wait....what???? Please tell me the professor is coming back..puppet history with Ryan & Shane is the best...come back professor..Ryan ,we know you've been robbed of the trophy but its not worth it.  .waaaahhhhhh😭😭😭😭
If watching TV teen dramas has taught me anything, its that death means nothing if you dont watch the life fade from their eyes and seesee a body, their death can always be undone, even theyre canonically dead. Dead one episode, alive and blackmailing you the next.
yall better bring the professor back to life or im gonna be very upset next season lol
Why do I feel like crying....
Didn't see that coming 😦
That was amazing
If you all permanently hurt one little blue hair on that deranged little head, I will summon satan myself
i love the affectionate way ryan says "he likes to play little tricks" 💕 also, as someone currently in a walking cast/boot w a leg injury i did not love the Fiery Leg Crusher- could feel that shit in my bones
Bravo Shane! 🤓🤗
Where's Joyce Louis-Jean???? She's so funny.
Ryan  go get the professor by next week. Plz
RYAN WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!!! WE HAVE TO SAVE THE PROFESSOR
Double Beans for Double B's.
Professor no!!
The fact that Ricky Goldsworth's name wasn't on Ryan's list of demons is an outrage
I'm still in shock, y'all can't just do that to us?!?! I LOVE THIS SHOW & THE PROFESSOR!!!
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
So uh. Is this the finale? Or the FINALE finale?? They can duct tape that right?
I’m here just to say HOW DARE U SAY THAT ABOUT WHATABURGER?!?
I did not realize I was that attached to the professor, rest in peace king
The Professor better be in the next Jurassic World movie as a newly revived dinosaur.
Ok but- it was about time Ryan got his trophy.
I hope this doesn't mean this was a SERIES finale . . . I love this show, I don't want it to end :(
Blame the devil for this!!! Not the lord!!!
RYAN! WHAT! HAVE! YOU! DONE!!
I cant believe Ryan did this after the professor gave him the last jelly bean :(
Why is this the first time this has been recommended to me
Sooo...... No more puppet history???
Them: We aren't doing lore you got it? No lore! Us: Right.... Them: the Professor is dead  Us. Right....
So next season is absolutely Ryan taking on the Professor's role in an attempt to summon him back, right? Like, maybe he goes to the Genie himself to get time travel powers, or maybe he ends up dabbling in supernatural stuff again, or he follows the Professor's clues left throughout time- OH maybe it's actually guest historians next season and Ryan gets clues via wrong answers in questions because he remembers stuff from past seasons!
Wikifeet picture does not actually contain any feet. Puppet, demon or human kind alike!   P.s: I love this channel 😍❤
If I’ve learned one thing from Supernatural, DEAD DOESNT MEAN DEAD DEAD……….right?
Bruh they better recon that shit
WHAT JUST HAPPENED
"Do you believe in ghosts?" "No." "Do you believe in ghosts?" "Absolutely not." "Mmm....okay. Okay." I'm sure that's nothing to be concerned about.
Did I hear that right, "Mind palace"?
Ryan sold out the professor for a trophy >:0
Are there two puppeteers working Asmodeus? I can't tell.
When I tell u my jaw dropped 🤣
18:30
Professor McNasty: Sarah, my moon and stars! Sarah: I've only met you once?
Okay, Puppet History just officially moved into the weird ...🤯  EXCELLENT 👍👌.  Next season opening is DEFINITELY going to be interesting.   Well done, Watcher! I did not see this coming!
Did anyone else get emotional when the T-Rex ate the professor?
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! fuck
I love that everyone is geniunely concerned for the Professor like it's literally not a piece of fabric on Shane's hand
"my foot is possessed!" +dramatic gasps  "... So anyway..." 🤣😂
When the first question wasn’t “What gone on in Loudon”, that made me irrationally angry
if there isn’t anymore puppet history after this i might have to pull a professor  *sobs*
Noooooooo!!  RIP Professor!   Today Watcher chose violence and I am NOT ok. 😭😭😭😭
Best ending ever !
RYAN!!! HOW COULD YOU?!?!?
So is puppet history cancelled... or????
The Wikifeet watermark on the Professor's picture at the end raises more questions.
the-buzzfeed-unsolved-supernatural-ification of puppet history
What if next season its hosted by Ryan or the professors son and he has no idea what happened to his father
wouldn't this just be epilepsy exaggerated? idk
Rewatched omg the watermark on the professor's portrait🤣🤣🤣
holy shit.
whaaaatttt
Ryan making us fall for him and hi little smile "I think it's a lot more fun to be kind" <3  Also one of the most catchy songs imo, loved those harmonies And the WIKIFEET WATERMARK OML
My theory: Remember in the previous Puppet History, how Ryan and the Professor didn't see eye to eye at certain moments. But when Season 3 came around Ryan's personality change. Did you guys notice that in the first episode of the new season, how Ryan was being nice to the professor? Even the special guest found it strange. I believe that he was being nice so nobody would suspect him.
underrated joke is the wikifeet watermark
WAIT HE GOT EATEF
Watcher: The Professor is canonically dead.  Wholock, Supernatural, and Marvel fans: Riiiiiiiiiiigghhht.
Well, I guess I need to solute my Professor Crossing the Delaware mug... I hope he's telling stories in puppet heaven.
That death hit harder than squid game
The late Professor has been saying since the beginning that these competitors are "ruthlessly competing for the coveted cup, and title of History Master." And Ryan, that certainly was ruthless
why am i crying
I just came for some fun history and now he's DEAD??!!!!?!!?!
There’s an old movie based on these events called The Devils. Look up the plot, it’s wild 😂
1:04 The most important thing in this episode is the usage of the term "mind palace" confirming that Ryan has probably watched BBC Sherlock
... I'm sure he's fine.
HOLD ON
EXCUSE ME
I am deeply hurt.
i can't believe the professor is fucking dead.
"wow... WOOOW... ...WoW, all i can say is wow"  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5F8mLWjZeA
This can’t be the last season:(
...I'm okay with this. Good for you Ryan.
28:02 I almost spit out my water-
THE WIKIFEET WATERMARK ON THE PROFESSORS PHOTO???? LMFAOOOOOO
YOU DID IT RYAN. YOU WON. CONGRATULATIONS. 8D   I'M GENUINELY HAPPY FOR YOU.
Deal with the devil tsk tsk tsk
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
We'll miss you, Professor.  Can't wait to see you somehow get revived or return in some way. I like the idea of putting the infinity beans into the cup to bring him back
I don't know if I'm ok with this....
ICONIC
The wikifeet watermark in the end LMFAOO
The effort put into this show is INSANE. Loving the special effects and storytelling!
Next season should be an adventure with Ryan going through different time periods to try and collect all the Infinity Beans to bring back the professor
The unsolved shade
"POSSESS ME DADDY"
Wait a minute, you mean those medieval donut dancers from the illuminaries were based in reality?!
Did the ending of the episode make you: A) Laugh B) Not care C) Irrationally upset  Well, (*tears forming*) looks like we got a few sea dogs over here
professor teaches dino bones ryan and guest star trilobite about the meteor that's gonna kill them all
I honestly believe ghosts just straight up TORMENTED people in the early years of civilization because it was way harder to record proof lol
Nunspringa 🤣🤣🤣
Glad to see when watcher honors the professor, they get his picture from wikifeet lmaooo
Having a guest who doesn't believe in ghosts in a puppet history episode talking about demons while her boyfriend who is a skeptic too be the host is the greatest delight
Oh my god i was right. Ryan killed the professor
The close-up shot where Sara goes "that's a genie" is one of the funniest thing tbh 😂
HOLY SHIT
It makes sense that Ryan would work with the devil because he disrespected Whataburger (which btw is pronounced Waterburger)
Ryan bopping but still deeply disturbed is giving me life
The Legend of Karen
Ryan you devious monster!
The professor is clearly simping on Sara Rubin. Shane be aware🤨  HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
This episode killed me. Ive been screaming in laughter for like the past 30 minutes
So many conflicting emotions!!!!!!
"What kind of lore can a puppet show about history have?" Apparently a lot. Apparently enough to make a deal with a devil, and leave an unresolved plot that has to continue in another season.
YAY!!!!!! Jelly Bellies for RYRY!!
captions for the deaf? Can't really read the professors lips sadly
Aye it's only #24 but this biz TRENDINGGGG can't wait to see what yall do next
Idk how to feel about the ending 💀
I was gonna go back and rewatch the song... but that ending has me feeling too down... lol
this is not at all what i thought i was going to see when i clicked this. hardcore thought it was about a possessed puppet
PARKING LOT RYAN!!!!!!!! MEET ME OUTSIDE!!!!! I JUST WANNA TALK!!!!!!!
I hope this isn't the end of Puppet History, but that was a great episode, no matter what.
Wasn't the film The Devils based on this event?
NO! THE PROFESSOR!!
As much as I miss the Professor that final musical number slapped
Okay I love the lore! This is starting to turn into a great TV series!
😱
Nooooooooo!!!!! Quick call The Doctor we might be able rescue the Professor.
No, no, no, NO! You don't get to take the professor away from us!! I curse you Ryan Bergara!
Cardinal "Rish-a-loo" snbddbsjsnjdjdbdnsjsdb there was an attempt at least
always worth the seizure risk
This isn’t Ryan this is Ricky Goldsworth
Well now I'm really curious how the potential season 5 is gonna go...
That was amazing.... But Ryan I want the Professor back
If there's a stand in puppet with a different voice actor next season until the professor comes back maybe Shane will be able to be a guest on the show
No this show is all I had left 🙃 not the professor lol
Hey uhhh what the f---
NO. I will not accept this ending. And Sara just sitting there, explaining the characters....was she complicit?!?! Ryan, I will never forgive you!!!  PS - Luv ya, luv the series, big fan.
ok, but can we talk about the end animation! R.I.P Professor McNasty
Ryan Boogara makes a come back. Poor RyRy. #StandWithRyRy
Jeff Lynn would have been proud of that mess of a song
this is my favorite episode 🤣
Please tell us this is the infinity war to a future endgame
When I heard season finale, I just thought “It better be Sara”
does shane like that there was a nun from the devils in space jam 2
NOOOO THE PROFESSOR!!! My heart hurts :,( Fix it beef boy
Fuuuuuck duuude best seasoned finale ever my loooort
not the professor's in Memoria picture being from wikifeet lol
So Ryan was just a good student cuz he made a deal with the devil? He best get his shit together n wish the Professor back
I absolutely LOVE this!!! Can't wait for more! By the way the song was fantastic 👏🏾
Italian Dracula can't hurt you Italian Dracula:
Son of a bitch !! I knew it!! Ryan and the Genie were in on this....but seriously, tho... will there be a Puppet History in the future 😵☹
Got that pic from wikifeet, eh?
That was incredible. Y’all have out-done yourselves😂😂😂
Noooooooooo! Please more of this show, save the professor!
smh season was to fast
41:00 Ryan turns joker
Wonder if Ryan’s going to make a deal with the genie to get the professor back?
…the lore is so intense i’m at a loss for words
Oh shit! Mephisto was behind it all along!
Ryan in 2018: ooh demons are so scary im just a poor little meow meow Ryan in 2021: *makes a deal with the actual devil*
Imagine if THIS was the first Puppet History you decided to watch… what a trip
Any Obey Me fans up in here?
Omg guys… I just remembered, we still got the god phone. What if God brought Professor back?!
the action packed finale... I'm in shock.
These things are only 6 episodes long per season haha? Had no clue.
cool story but where's the hot doga
:( bro...
Yeah nice try I’ve seen Loki, I know how this goes
The wikifeet thingy is sending me 😂😂😂
I'm a passing fan of comics. So when I see that a character is canonically dead, I know that won't last very long. Time to wait for the inevitable recon where the professor turns out to have survived, spends millenia getting his powers back, and plot his revenge against Ryan and the genie.
WHAT THE FUCK YOU KILLED HIM
Hi Ollie! Love you!
Please don’t let the professor die. This is my favorite series ever 😭😭😭😭
Thank you for this entertaining/ emotionally devastating finale! You all did a fantastic job and I can't wait for what's next! <3
Try showing someone 7:16 out of context.
I’m I the only one who think this is where the nun from the conjuring came from 🤔
Can't wait till season 5😎😎😎😎😎🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Great season finale. Great song. Great history. I've been more committed to this show and what would happen next than any show in a long time.
Nooooooo! Bring back the professor! And all the puppets! Him and Ryan need to defeat that blasted genie! Ryan what have you done? The pain on my heart is so great..... RIP The Professor.....
The Professor better be in the next Jurassic World movie as a newly revived dinosaur.
so when can we buy the album of all the puppet history songs????
there better be another season!!!!
The Ghoulboys made a cameo in Jacksepticeye's I am Fish video
NO
Why... why would they kill the professor off? Does this mean no more puppet history?
I can’t believe they just Infinity War-ed us
PROFESSOR NO!!!!
I’m gonna go ahead and suspect it was all a healthy dose of ergot poisoning mixed with the power of suggestion.
*Carry on my wayward son begins to play and a black impala rolls up*
NOOOOO PROFESSOR!!!
F
Aw I need CC Caption i don’t understand what are they saying cause I’m deaf :( I wanted to know what they’re talking about it
The way I was so hype during the last ten minutes of this episode
This is incredible oh my god
Now a days we bitch when our internet goes out. Imagine in the 1600s when the only excitement you had was watching nuns get exorcised
why am i crying over a puppet
Best episode ever!!! Finally justice for Ryan !!!! Maybe the dinosaur will spit out the professor .
Dude, it's not God's fault this happened... It's people.. (People always wanna blame God, even when they don't believe in him..)
I’m offended at least the whataburger statement 😂
please tell me we get a prehistory season next!!
Loving the secondary plot developing with all the puppet objects
Is this the final chapter in the heavy heavy book we call history?!?
So when does the next season start? 😂
The last picture of the professor with the Wikifeet waterstamp dear lord
Man the devil is always SUCH a pleasure to work with.  LOVE that guy. WELCOME TO HELL PROFESSOR. LONG TIME NO SEE BUDDY. HAHAHAHA. We're gonna have some fun.
why am i kinda offended ryan didn’t like whataburger 🤨
and now it’s time to rewatch the entire season and pay reeeeeally close attention to ryan
The last song reminds me of something ELO would do 😀
So if Ryan eats that last jelly bean will become a puppet? Is Ryan going to replace The Professor?
BIGGEST TWIST IN HISTORY
I'm so so sad the season is over!! I can't wait for the next one.
You folks really pulled out the stops on this one. Great song, amazing triple puppet. Super glad to see rubin in this one as well. Great work to the team.
it's fun to be kind lol - love ya'l l: )
The Professor: Possess me Daddy. Me: Possess me Professor McNasty.
40:30 I LOVE THIS FUCKING SHOWWWWWWWWWWWW
This is becoming some CW tv show
Asmodeus is probably the catchiest song yet
Unsolved: Ryan is deathly afraid of ghouls and ghosts Puppet History: easily makes deals with demons and the Devil all for a stupid trophy  what a character development lol
AYO?????
Welp. Im sure everything is fineeeeeee
Thank you, based comment section bc I deadass thought we just witnessed the secret series finale of Puppet History and have been sitting in silence for like, 5 minutes   Ryan and Shane, you brilliant, creative geniuses, what the actual fuck is wrong with you oh my god
It's a conspiracy. Ricky goldworth died and came back and Ryan Begarea and he is being and has minimum recollections of his past live and is being tortured by the professor, destined to lose at a trivia game show for all eternity(this should really be a book)
I am starting a campaign to sue the professor for rigging the game. #proRyan
I can't believe this actually happened, lmaooo Ryan you freaking mad lad
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
NO HE GOT EATED WTF???????????
IM CRYING WHERES PROFESSER NOOO
NO PROFESSUR!!!!!!!!!!!! NOOOOOO
“So what demons are are currently possessing you?” I was hoping so hard that he would say Ricky Goldsworth
Truly entertaining. Rip professor.
GIVE US MORE PROFFESER BACKSTORY PLZZZZZZZZ
That clown face paint at the end tho lmao
nooooooooo, he cant be dead like he is a puppet, he wont be desolved in a dinosaur´s belly
Talk about a roller coaster of a ride. Wow.
I'll take your vessel for a spin ASMODEUS and look so lovely in your skin. This is seriously talent.
"canonically dead fyi" 😳
Ever since my friend introduced me to this series, Ive been addicted. And now the season is ending?! A tragedy
Monsters wolf, dancing plagues, mass possession I got the feeling that the professor is trying to make France into the new Transylvania.  Edit : also don’t forget about the serial poisoning and black masses)
"now since this isn't one of those lazy shows that leaves things unsolved..."  😂
Wait you killed him nooooo
Since everyone is putting some theories, I'd like to put in my own. I think that next season they will have a "substitute teacher" that no one really likes maybe, and Ryan will be working in the background to try and bring the Professor back. Maybe with the God phone or something lol.
What???
I hope Puppet history never ends. I love every episode that comes out and thank you for another great season.
WHAT HOLY FUCK WAIT WHAT
Oh no! please tell me this is like the time when Mr. Peanut died…😭😱
whats your PO box adress. My therpaist needs to know where to send the bill.
it’s on sight beef boy
NOOOOOOOO! NOT THE PROFESSOR! I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT HIM! 😟💜😟
why is the puppets voice so distinct from shane's to me. why is his personality so different and yet so consistent. what the fuck is going on over there
Never in my life did I expect to boo a Puppet History episode. DAMN YOU GENIE AND DEVIL
Noooooo
0:37 brb im crying from the cuteness
ryan: let this be a lesson to you sara: *no hesitation* FUCK
"Posses me daddy" 👉🏻🥺👈🏻
Be honest, how many of us ARF along with the C dogs
what did I just witness?
Remember when this used to be a cute little show that taught people about some of the more obscure history things? Me too. Me too
rest in peace professor 😔😔😔
HOLY SHIT WHAT AN ENDING 🤯
I AM NOT OK
Maybe there was a gas leak in the convent, lol
I have a theory that this whole season was just Ryan dreaming and there gonna come back in the next season and everything’s gonna be fine 😃
I FUCKING CALLED IT
NOOOOO PROFESSOR 😭😭😭
ricky goldsworth really did it huh
SAVE THE PROFESSOR 😭😭😭
He could be freed from coprolite next season 😂
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates.🎈
I'm sad the professor died.  RIP prof.... hopefully he had a son or a professor's assistant or something... hmm.
35:12 I HAVENT LAUGHED THIS GENUINELY IN SO LONG AHAHAHA
Ryan thinking: [hmm the professor's growing on me, maybe I'll rescind my deal with the devil...] Professor: Now since this is not one of those lazy shows that leaves things unsolved... Ryan: [nope nvm full steam ahead]
NO. FUCKING. WAY.
As it turns out…. Ryan was the one who was the demons Boi
I hope we get a Thanksgiving special  or something because I cannot wait long for more puppet history
Texans are furiously typing
Absolutely breathtaking
Ladies and gentlemen. France.
Pretty sure it's nonsense like this that convinced my family to move from France to (what would be) Canada in 1634.
WAIT WTF???? DID THEY JUST PULL A SUPERNATURAL ON ME???
Omg please save the professor for season 5!
T-Rex eats The Professor.  I audibly shout NO!! 📢 If there isn't a season 5 of PH, I will unsubscribe........  And then keep checking back for new episodes. 🕵
i’m never going to forgive ryan for this i am so sick and tired.
That beautiful moment between Ryan and The Professor made me cry 😭
That emotional send off was not the time for clown makeup and wikifeet jpgs.
He kind of had it coming. I love the professor but i mean you can’t be a jerk to another person over the course of three seasons and then be surprised when they finally turn on you.
If there's a next season it's basically going to be the professor being passive-aggressive as hell towards Ryan.
NOOOOOOOOOOO i love the professor!!
Is Satan the new host?
What a twist. I would've expected Ricky to come out of ryan and kill the professor himef
Ryan talking shit on Whatabuger is NOT OK
Commenting for the kids to see you
is puppet history.....done?
Lmao I thought "They are some damn clowns" & then immediately after 40:59  Just wow. What a sych.
😳😮😬👀
WDYM
Professor I really can't handle this right now I've got like four tests, please come back to life and help me :(
WAIT WHAT?! That’s it?!
“What did it cost?” Was low-key expecting Ryan to just be like, “Not that much, tbh.”
Shane, I really enjoy how weird you are
I’m sorry, what?!
Yup the 1600's were wild. You could pretty much blame anyone of anything and use anything as proof. Pact between the devil and this hot priest in your own handwriting? Admissable. Stabbing a guy in the nuts with an unsanitized needle and saying that he was a witch because he screamed? Also admissable.
so the professor's gonna have his Jesus arc very soon huh?
28:02 omfg I’m dying 😂
Put the songs on spotify we beg!!!!
Bruh what the fuck Ryan
HA!  I love the *gasp* in the french accent!  That was great!
😮🥺☹️ what.
“let this be a lesson to all of you out there-“ “FUCK” “-that’s what you get for dancing with the devil”
LOVE THIS FINALE!! ✨
This ruined my whole my month :((
Welp I wasn't expecting that. I love the professor. And here I thought Ryan and the professor were finally getting along.
Quantum realm here we come to retrieve the professor.
We'll get another season, right?
We didn't deserve to lose the professor like that :'(
Props on the Eons reference and Wikifeet profile pic
Y’all think the nuns liked- burned the edges of the contract with fire to give it that “Just out of Hell” singed look. Maybe sprayed it with Brimstone perfume lol
What an awesome season finale! It sucks we have to wait a while for the next one. Honestly I love how straightforward and funny the lore is on this show. Other YouTube shows get carried away trying to make their lore deep and complex.
Not to be dramatic, but this is the worst day of my life
7:14 That’s too cute for my heart😭😂
Ryan.....what did you do???
That shot at lazy shows that end UNSOLVED  had me dead!
Ryan is going through something 😬
Nuh uh i did not agree to this
NOOOOO, The Professor 😭
I dont think people appreciate how good Shane is with the mouth movement of the Professor. The mouth moves with every syllable right with the words and thats pretty tiring on the hand and forearm, good job Shane
Someone better explain this and fucking fast, Shane
GKnee? Still less eyeliner than Brett Michaels.  If the professor doesn't come back? I'm gonna send the Tangerine Palpatine's PAC a donation from The Watcher.  After he sees your follower count? He will INFEST this godforsaken space and it will be ALL YOUR FAULT GKNEE!!! (no I won't. Just tell the GKnee that)
Gee, Shane, you could have just said you didn't want to do the show anymore
Why's the professor lighter??
Spoilers all over these comments. Jfc people
Why did you do this to me! This is worse than Game of Thrones! Why does every fictional character I become emotionally attached to die...? 😞
ok but this song was realllly good
Omg the end! So good! Also bring him back!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! Professor! 😥😞
I- I’m- i-…. *sobbing* PROFESSORRRRR
The ending was gold
WHAT LMAO
Brava *claps with limo hands* also where’s the HR person for this? They could’ve def stopped Ryan from doing a deal with the devil
man, did you have to use the wikifeet pic
The joker face😂😂😂
That ending is weird. AND I LOVE IT!!!
Wait so whats gonna happen now. I mean the professor is canonically dead so is this the last season or is the professor gonna come back as a ghost or a demon. Or is he gonna travel through time the long way around basically just survive through millions of years since he is probably doesnt age. Never thought a show about puppets would have such lore and did anyone notice when the genie vanish in the background or telly jelly all the anthropomorphic puppets became real and a creepy pair of eyes that continue to watch you.
THAT WAS A RIDE
Sarah is just everyone's reaction at the end of the episode
Oooo, that song has just got in my top 5 Puppet History songs!  And now I wonder what the death means for the show; hopefully there will still be more seasons cause I adore this.
I need POSESS ME DADDY t-shirts, thank you.
PROFESSOR MCNAAAAAAAASTYYYYYY 😭😭😭😭
I love these guys.
Imagine the professor knew what was going to happen and he was nervous about what was going to happen and that’s why there was suck a long break in between the song and the announcing of the winner. He needed a breather
when next season is hosted by the dinosaur>>>>>
So we got the lore we asked for but at what cost
dont talk to me im now in mourning
Irrationally sad.
https://youtu.be/l9jacVw1HFo
If Shane was my history professor, I would never miss any of his classes
Lol I love y’all
yo what the fuck
Nooo! Professor! 😟
I love how uncomfortable Ryan looks
y’all......y’all did not just do that to us......y’all DID NOT
There's no fuckin way they jus merked ole Mr P... Ain't no way...
“Alex the Demon!”
Also shout out to all the special effects required to pull this off, that was awesome
NO I DONT BELIEVE IT THIS DID NOT JUST HAPPEN
THST WAS EPIC WHAT
So is season 5 going to be about Ryan's quest to save the professor, and in order to do so he has to be the one discovering and telling the stories of history and gain the help of previous guests and also a new guest by the name of Shayne Madej who stops by at one point, as he tries to bring the professor back?
Lmfao Ryan’s joker arc
"the lazy shows that leave it unsolved" Sounds like someone just took a dig at Buzzfeed Unsolved lmao
yall this is just like when marina formerly of the diamonds killed off electra heart at the end of the album
I'm sorry..what just happened?
not me sobbing over a puppet ;-; someone save our tiny 'dead' prof!
not the whataburger slander 😩🤚
oh no it's a crossover episode
The wiki feet image overlay really was a top notch addition
I'm more curious about what Ryan and Sarah saw WITHOUT the special effects lol
28:02
Thank you so so much for the epilepsy warning at the beginning. That goes a long way and is so appreciated.
please post a 40 minute long behind the scenes of this series
Ive attempted an exorcism or two
I think I'm in shock!!!!
NOOO PROFESSOR! RYAN I LOVE YOU BUT WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!?
This is literally my favorite series on YouTube. I look forward to this every single week. I can't wait for it to come back!
So anyone thinking of the book song? The knowledge of how a T-Rex disgusts a full human? Interesting huh
Watching the beast of gevudan episode where it starts with the professor saying he's gonna live forever hits different now-
This educational puppet show has no right to make me cry and become so invested in the characters, but here we are. RIP Professor, you will be missed. 😢
y’all better be ending this season so soon bc ur working on are you scared 😐
oh... my god
Why am I crying...
i do not accept this wholeheartedly.
thanks to everyone running the episode already know what happens
Why did I read Loudun as London 😂
Damn that was quite the finale.
Well that was unexpected
I know I can wish the professor back where's the genie #wish he was alive again
The professor was my one and only love why cruel world
Does anyone else think one of the reasons Supernatural is winding up is because after so many seasons Ryan actually doesn’t really believe anymore, and they don’t see the point in going on either with Ryan pretending he still believes but his heart really not in it anymore, or with both of them being open about being sceptics and doing something basically pointless?
There's been a movie made about this all in 1971 called 'The Devils'. It's rated X because of graphic content but it's a pretty interresting movie if you can deal with violence and sexual motives.
I was basically saying 'The f word?!' throughout the end of this episode... I can't believe that the Professor is gone... Ryan, how could you?!  And this is the reason why he kept on asking for jellybeans! He was making sure that the Professor had none of them left when the Season Finale came around!  Wait... The Professor said 'Season Finale' right? Does this mean that we'll get another season of Puppet History? I wanna see a redemption arc for Ryan!
W H A T
crossaints aren't even from France lmao
NOOOOO
Ryan is lying!! Ricky Goldsworth is the demon that posessing him
PROFESSOOOOOOOOR 😭😭😭
You gotta admire the professor’s commitment to not believing in demons despite meeting satan himself in a previous puppet pop-in and literally booking a demon as the musical guest for this episode   Also I’m guessing that the professor will be brought back to life by Ryan finally learning his True Name, in the meantime, R.I.P. to the Professor 😭
NOT THE PROFESSOR
Puppet therapy where ryan has to remember all the fights they had on past episodes and it teaches about mental health and overall psychology??
Canonically dead! No!!!!!! Professor!! Who wants to will the Professor back to life together??
This isn’t the last episode of puppet history is it….???
Just 'cause he's canonically dead, that doesn't mean he can't canonically come back to life.
So next season will be hosted by the Ghost of the Professor, who has been waiting literal eons for his chance to live again. The only way to save the Professor is for Ryan to collect the Infinity Jelly Beans which are hidden in the trophies of all the previous guests. Ryan has to defeat of the guests to get their cup. Slowly, Ryan comes to realize that the winner algorithm is in fact based not on points, but how much you care about the Professor.
Professor: Have you ever had any experiences with demons?   Ryan: Yeah we stole his bridge
I knew Ryan was playing the long game of revenge. I will say this though, the professor has been gaslighting Ryan for 4 seasons. He kinda deserved some type of comeuppances.
Guys don't worry about the Professor, he'll be fine. All he has to do is create a portal and warp the t-rex to the middle of modern day london and the inertia of the time travel will make the t-rex barf him up.
this is what Supernatural's final season should have been!!!
...what did it cost? ....everything....and another season of..ARE YOU SCARED? MUAHAHAHAA
tho i loved it, Midnight Mass would never!!!
I just hope for the epic return of the Professor in season 5. 🥺🤞
RYAN YOU BEST FIGURE OUT A WAY TO FIX THIS MESS YOUVE MADE. IM TRYING TO GET AN EDUCATION HERE
the wikifeet watermark on the professors picture straight up murdered me
Canonically?! NOOOOOOO!
I think we should be talking more about Sara saying she'd be cool with chilling with a demon. Love that for her and Shane
Sarah is just so damn delightful 💛
The Professor IS history!
Let's thank biggest unsung hero this season:      Ryan's therapist Edit: I was wrong
nuuuuuuuuuu :( this actually made me sad :,(
No, professor! There's so  much more history left to share!
Honestly, you guys never fail to deliver. Can't wait for next season.
Why the fuck am I genuinely upset about the canonical death of a fucking puppet? What have you people done to me?
Well we see where all of Shane's Hot Doga energy went.
DUDE!
I enjoyed the way Ryan (aka Beef Boy, also not the Genie) and “the professor” got along on this episode. Kind of like old times. Sounded like Sean Connery sang lead on the end song. It took the devil to finally give Ryan his due trophy…what is going on?! Is the professor dead?
My ancestors lived in this town while this happened and it makes me so happy #boogarasforlife
Me: calmly going to read comments Comments: Oh my gawd, he fuckin ded. Me: ExcuSE ME?!
I- wtf just happened
This is amazing.
RIP Mcnasty
Oh yaye I love Sarah!!
https://youtu.be/cxKKn4kNIP0🔥
This shit can't be done
I'm asstaroth, 1 of 7 demons living in this 2 bedroom apartment 😂
not me crying over a fucking puppet
Okay I have a theory. The next season of puppet history will be Ryan (who is now the new professor) creating some sort of time machine or making another devil deal so he can go back in time. Ryan goes to different time periods and uses his knowledge from previous PH episodes to traverse through time (with the help of previous PH guests and puppets who have all come back to help) until eventually reaching the Cretaceous period, where the Professor has been living in the wild after cutting himself out of the t-rexes stomach, and they all face the genie together.
Noooooooooooooooooooo......................
I’m gonna need some possess me daddy merch after this lol
Well I’m more emotional than anticipated
I think the ending made me love the show even more. Ryan in  clown face and using the professor’s wiki feet picture… the little things entertain me 😂😂
Is there gonna be a too many spirits this October?
my man beef boy did the thanos
"and England" **shows union jack**
I hope this isn't the end,  but if it is, that was epic!
...no more puppet history?
Is this the series finale or will Ryan take up the mantle.
Love the show so much!!! Could you look into Stories from Indian history? Trust me there is plenty. Maybe make the seasons longer?
RIP The Professor. A Real one, a Historical OG, Puppet who captured the heart of millions.
i laughed so hard when he was listing all these grand demon names and then there's  "Alex".
oh.my.god
Um
I freaking love you guys for giving a flash warning!
Ryan needs to find the Genie and wish the professor back to life for season 5!
RIP Professor 😭😭😭😭
Te fact that all of season 4 foreshadows this is funny to me which means it was planned and not last minute. Now he said season finally so maybe there might be a season 5?? But with a new professor
EXCUSE ME?! WHA- I- GUH- WHAT THE FUCK?!?  ????????
im only here for the lore
I will not tolerate this whataburger slander
Wonder if genie's gonna host next season until Ryan wins the professor's life back. But ryan is fighting ricky too.
free him Ryan
:(
Are you guys going to do more “Are You Scared”??? For Halloween maybe?? That’s my FAVORITE series 😍
Rip Professor
thanks for the epilepsy warning at the beginning finally also shame kate wasnt the finale guest
I want to know why Google Drive is a devilish program. I NEED TO KNOW.
CAN WE TALK ABOUT RYAN’S SHOES
I hope ryan is posed so he loves Whataburger and hate in and out
you happy now goldsworth? you got your little cup, but what is it worth without a single jelly bean to hold in it? i hope you're proud.
the ending of this season finale was CRACK af! also, no way the professor died being eaten by a dino is canon
OMFG I CAN'T RYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
NOOOOOOO THE PROFESSOOOOOOR
Needle in sack, bitch gon' crack
This feels like an extra short season. Also, this is basically the ot of "The Devils."
Well presented
His eyes are all wonky I like to imagine they slowly get worse as episodes go on
And that my friends, is a season finale!
Ryan , my sweet child  ... I'm old enough to be your mom and I have Multiple Sclerosis and I'm more flexible than you are  ... you may be a prime candidate for daily yoga and that you don't feel like a giant stiff turd in 20 years  ...
The whole budget really went into this one and I’m not mad about it
Woah!! Nothing weird happened in this epic season finale!! Loved it!!!!!
Okay, but for real, The Professor is coming back for the next seasons, right? My wife loves the Professor and would be sad if he's gone forever. Please don't make my wife sad, Shane.
"Sarah Rubin, my moon and stars" 😭😭😭 They're so cute.
WTF The Professor needs to be resurrected!
Why does....Why does the Professor's memorial image have Wikifeet stamped all over it?
Rest In Peace Prof!
The nuns were just voguing the house down boots @7:30
WTF did I just watch? Is he really gone?  ( lol, also why am I feeling sad about a puppet? )
okay the lack of dedication of this nun is appalling! you couldn’t even carve it in your hand?
Me 10 min into the video: That sounds like The Devils (1971) Me after they say Urbain Grandier: oh it IS The Devils (1971)
This can’t be the end of puppet theater!!! Please?!? Please!?!?
Oh boi he ded o.o
My mouth is literally on the floor! Not the professor 😭😭😭
i love you guys, also shout out to steven lim !!!
This is such a good production.
rewatching this video and realising how much the professor and ryan foreshadowed the ending
not the wikifeet watermark over the professors picture 😭
The Prof is canon dead? what will happen now?
Tell me this isn't really the end!
The editor of this show doesn't know what the english flag looks like. They showed the British one
bit of clown makeup on Ryan at the end there
Somebody must've taken a Spotify subscription and played Daechwita
that's a demon XD
I wonder what's in store for season 5! Will there be a university for us puppet history students?!
Wait, if the professor is dead, is this then the end of the series? Say it ain't so!
Noooooo! Professor! 💔😭
Proffesor i will miss youuuu
I feel bad for anyone who has never watched puppet history before and thought this was as good an episode as any to jump in at  I speak from experience of discovering post mortem at the climax of the hot daga and genuinely thinking I was hallucinating
NOOOOOOO !!!!!!The Professor!!!!!!
NO, NOT THE PROFESSOR! NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
fly high sweet prince 🕊💔
I can’t believe the professor’s fucking dead
Tell me why am I crying over Puppet History lore
I love this show so much. Thank you guys for making such great content to keep us a bit sane during such harsh times.
Nunsense
So no more Puppet History? 🥺🥺🥺
ryan you...
DID YOU EDIT RYAN WITH CLOWN MAKEUP THAT ONE SECOND
Sarah saying she'd chill with demons says a lot about her relationship with known demon Shane.
ok now canonically revive him please
i think they are gonna jump into prehistoric times for history lessons :D
HEY BEEF BOY TURN ON YOUR LOCATION I JUST WANT TO TALK
Wait isnt there a Banned movie based on this one?
Fucken ricky got a bean lets go
The professor will come back I hope. He just needs a Delorean with a tone machine with doc. Love you guys
Wasn’t The devils the movie based on this
I will fight Ryan over that Whataburger quip
Legit there better be another season or I-
What?! 4 season finale already?!
"Do you believe in ghosts?" Weird... feel like I've been here before... nother time, another place Stay outta that house Ryan!
Nooo Ryan you have to resurrect the professor for next season 😭😭
My excitement whenever they both say C is frankly embarrassing.
It can't be so I love you professor!
My laughing (because of the end meme reinactement) mixing up with Satan's was somewhat pleasant !
We better get a mini series about getting the professor back
Sarah reminds me a lot of a young Winona Ryder! Nice finale guys👏👻
Of course, Wikifeet has the picture
Listening to this on the drive to class was insane.
They killed my source of serotonin
So glad we got to see Shane's true form
I love that they brought Sarah back for the lore ep. like they really had to pick someone that'd roll with that whole ending without bursting out laughing and ruining the ~drama~ - and she did a lovely job♡
Anyone else rewatching this season to figure out when exactly Ryan decided to betray the professor???
This series has really fallen off this season.
bro this is cinematic gold
Father Thomas is not gonna be happy, Ryan.
whats gonna happen will Ryan go back in time to safe the professor because his feels guilt about it
NOOOOO PROFESSOR!!!!! I’m genuinely upset. Is this the end of puppet history??
HOLY SHIT
Not Ryan just disrespecting Whataburger
Okay so I've apparently become attached to a puppet.  Dont do this to us. Give me the professor back ;-;
This is one of the most frustrating stories I've ever heard  Religious morons everywhere and logic doesn't exist
listen. if you haven't watched this yet, step away from the comment section.
do you ever look at the professor and think that you're seeing shane? because they are starting to look identical
It is hard as an Indian to watch this video seriously, considering the title 😬
My partner and I just stared at the screen for like a minute. What the hell?!
“I’ve had zero experience with demons because their not real and they don’t exist”.   Well until  provenotherwise these ideas were thought to be crackpot nonsense as well: The continental drift Evolution Heliocentricity  Antiseptic Space travel Humans also used to think using an ice pick on a brain was good for mental illness. My point I guess is if you close your mind to things just because you’ve never experienced them you limit the possibility of it. Who knows maybe 50 yrs from now they will say that some mental issues are caused by demons or that demons are bad energies. We don’t know.   I don’t think people like Dhamer, Bundt, Gacey existed without some outside evil influence. But that’s me. If you find it more comforting to “know”  that demons don’t exist good on ya.
i love these
when the professor asked them if they had any experience w demons, i really wish sarah would have said "i'm in a relationship w one" that would have been so funny LMAOO 😭😭
Ryan having a little Dr. Sleep moment
Holy SHit balls! WHat a finale! When will the new season be on? I need to KNOW!!!!!!!!!!!!
NOOOOOOOO IS THIS THE END FOREVER!?!?!?!??!?! IT CANT BE, THE PROFESSOR WILL SLICE HIS WAY OUT OF THAT TREX'S BELLY AND ONCE AGAIN BEND THE FABRIC OF TIME AND SPACE AND BRING US ANOTHER SEASON!!! PLEASE SAY IT IS TRUE
Why is no one talking about *👹"PoSsEsS mE dADdY"👹*  😭😂
Can we bring Steven Lim as a guest please...Miss him...is he ok
WAIT whaaaaaaaat?
The lore is so deep
_What?_  The Professor is dead?!  Well of course he'll come back to life, right? Right??
This was ELITE
Ryan, how could you! (Also Sara being like "that's a genie" "that's a demon" "that's the devil" is so funny, heck. XD)
London but with a British accent
😱😱😱😭😭😭
Okay seriously, why is the professors little theater brighter than my future?????? It hurts my eyes!
Jeez, all these "religious" assholes up in power abusing their authority. Can you imagine? Some high up priest you slighted in the past can just make a show of "possession" and make an accomplice accuse you of being a demon worshiper, then everybody and their mothers are suspicious of you now and suddenly you find yourself in trial for your head? LOL Makes you wonder what they're really up to nowadays.
This was worth the little wait! R.I.P. the Professor. I'm off to have a dance-off with the devil now.
Demon Roll Call: "And, of course, Alex showed up."  *Hell yeah I did*
Top 10 anime betrayals
RYAN
Ryan: Do you believe in ghosts?  The Professor: uhh, no.  *But he believes in genies, huh?*
I DIDN'T WANT RYAN TO WIN LIKE THIS! D: NEVER LIKE THIS! FIX THIS NAO, BEEF BOY.
The guitar between 17.55 and 18.25, I just wish I could listen to that all the time. 😭
@film theory plz explain loreeeeeeeee
💙💙💙 RIP little blue man.
"But do either of you have any experience with demons?"  Ryan: *buzzfeed unsolved flashbacks*
R.I.P professor 😔
Bro, Ryan really sold his soul to yhe devil for that trophy huh? Idk about you, but I'm kinda happy he got touch the trophy at least. Though it cost him the professor..
Prediction: This is the best thing to happen to the Professor, as he now ends up, as a living puppet, having to live through ALL OF HISTORY. This is also the worst thing to happen as millions of years without talking to anybody makes him more than a little crazy.
the picture with the wikifeet watermark at the end killed me on the spot XD
Fan theory: The Professor will be reincarnated in a slightly different form, so that Watcher can make actual Professor McNasty merch 😄
WHAT!!!!!
Just thinking of all the previous guests who'll be mourning this great loss. Kate is going to be crushed. Jermaine and Garrick too. Joyce! They need to team up and sort Ryan out for this betrayal. You've gone too far this time, Bergara!
This song kicks:)
R.I.P Professor!
Ryan, you bring back my sweet fuzzy blue boy or we are going to be having some words
Is this Watchers polite way of saying this show's never coming back? Because the Professor is dead??! I don't know what to think, all these seasons, building up to this... I hope Ryan is happy with himself.  Also the Professors picture at the end from wikifeet. Nice touch 👌
The entire season I felt like Ricky Goldsworth is going to be unleashed upon us. And it did happen :(
28:02     You’re welcome…
Haha “unsolved” burned
>wikifeet Goddamnit
Ok first rip professor mcnasty but also the water mark on his photo at the end.... Why does its say WIKI FEET 💀💀💀💀💀
I legit felt a light bulb go off at the name Grandier. ‘Oh yeah! That film where the nuns start shagging inappropriate items. I see you Professor, you wee fuzzy pervert.’
I came for the history I stayed because of the professor
PROFESSOR????????????
38:38 =so the Geenie... The geenie got granted?
38:16 =Holy Shite, Shane looked freaky there...
alright gang grab your tools, we’re gonna resurrect the professor!
Asmodeus... Ain't he the lead for the lusty ones out there?
THE PROFESSOR'S HEADSHOT AT THE END WAS FROM WIKIFEET???????
disney if it wasnt a family friendly animation company
I am now convinced that they were not possessed because from the demon names I've heard. Two of them were Leviathan and Behemoth, if you read the book of Job in the bible, they are not demons but living creatures created by God. They were said to live on Earth itself and even God praises these creatures as being part of his majestic creation. So how did these creatures manage to possess that nun if they were never demons in the first place?
Rip
Well, that has left today on a bit of a downer :(
thank you for making another one pretty soon. This is very entertaining and educating
I'm crying over a blue puppet from the internet used to give cool history lesson WTF help!!
WTF is watcher?
the wikifeet watermark is really adding to the lore
The next season is going to be absolutely amazing
Season finale? It feels like it only literally just came back.....
now the professor just gets to live through history tho. like he shows up next season and knows everything not bc of time travel but bc of immortality and just remembering it all (snorting magic asteroid dust or something idk)
I can’t cope with this amount of loss rn
Ryan finally won 🥲
YALL ACTUALLY JOKER-FIED RYAN??
The ending didn't do much to me. :/
WHAT
IM SO HYPED FOR THE NEXT SEASON!!!
ryan forgot to put ricky goldsworth in the list of demons possessing him
Ryan didn't even include ricky goldsworth as one of his demons ☹
"Canonically dead fyi" Pfft yeah right
Definitely top 10 anime betrayals of all time.
I’m simultaneously excited and sad that this is the finale.
Ryan's banter here makes me miss unsolved so much oh god
all jokes aside that song fucking slaps so hard, shane really outdid himself on this one
My 🌝 and 🌟 love love 💕, Professor I am betting on you to steal Shane’s gf
I love Sarah and Ryan playing along at the end
ryan has to save the pr. THEY CAN'T JUST LEAVE US HANGING LIKE THAT
You killed the professor????
the italian dracula was hilarious
Ryan's character development here! He's been unjustly denied the history master cup for far too long and I think he deserves to win, but not like this. On the other hand he's been threatening the professor most of the series and now he's finally successfully followed through the victory rings hollow. 2 equal sides of the same character moment.
Yummy
can appreciate the amount of effort and care these guys put into in designing/crafting the performance puppets? Like seriously, I keep getting impressed by each episode, that's true dedication right there.
When will you put these songs on streaming? I want to hear them all!
I yelled so loud at 3 am that my husband had to come check on me lmfao
imagine watching this series for the first time and they chose THIS as the first one to watch,,,
WHAT NOOOOOOOOOO
RIP The Professor.
Ryan... even for a man like me, that was just... low
Oh and Ive seen some great theories for puppet history next season but I gotta say, what kinda plot do we need where we get all the past winners back in Puppet Form to save the day/find out what happened to the rest of the puppets? And that at the end it turns out, as a technical winner, Ryan must also take on puppet form?
The professor better come back next season or i will slap every mother on the planet starting with your's @ryanbergara
The _Jokerification edit_ and the _WIKIFEET WATERMARK_ was so completely my brand of humor that I am gonna CRY.
Excuse me WHAT
I would pay to watch a horror/comedy about this story
so is no one gonna talk about how the professor's picture had wikifeet watermarks on it?
Nooooooo! I love the professor
If we don't see Ryan collecting the infinity beans to save the professor ima be upset  Edit: THANK YOU ALL FOR THE LIKES
Honestly didn’t know you guys had this channel. I saw another video somewhere that said you guys left buzzfeed. Not sure if it was IG. Definitely subscribed right away. Can’t wait for the new content
I am so confused. But....in a good way?
Y’all… I’m really going through all of the stages of grief for the Professor rn
Wait... Wait he's wrapping up the episode but there's like 8 minutes left.... Edit: oh dear God  Ps. Wikifeet??!
PROFESSOR NOOOOOO😭
"Canon" means nothing. Like rules, canon is meant to be broken.
Is no one gonna acknowledge that The Professor's photo is from wikifeet?
Ryan's gonna trick the genie to grant a wish to time travel & stop from ever collaborating w the Devil
Is that the end? Please no!
PROFESSOR NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
wikifeet
"Tourists came from as far away as England" *shows UK flag*
Nnnooooooo Professor :( WHYYYYYYYYY!!!!!
This show proves how under appreciated the art of puppetry is. We need more hands stuffed furred cilinders damnit!
Alternate ending: "What did it cost, Ryan?" Ryan turns the trophy over.  "$2.98"
RIP to the Professor. Thanks for the history lessons 😢 (I hope Ryan redeems himself somehow)
What if Ryan turns into a puppet and is trying to get revenge for the professor and Shane is a student?
HUH?
"now that's a genie" "that's a demon" "now that's the devil" i love sarah lmfao
Soooo uhhh is no one gonna mention the fact the the professors picture at the end was pulled from wikifeet? Lmaooo
O…okay…
At this point they should put puppet history songs over on spotify
Next season: Ricky and Ryan save the professor
I mean with the last jellybean, weren't they tied? Ryan still has never won! My guess is that they need to use a wish to get the professor back. I wonder if the mystery of the professor's name has anything to do with this....🤔 And why hasn't the professor been "making" jellybeans? How did they run out if he needs to eat daily???
NOOOOO PROFESSOR!!!!  😭😭😭 Helluva season end though 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 Bravo
Ryan's Joker Origin Story
Next season is going to be CRAZYYYY
Demons coming out of a guy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZB2sWFPpMo
I HAVE SOME LEGAL ARGUMENTS REGARDING THE VALIDITY OF A WISH MADE VIA POSSESSION WE NEED A HEARING TO BRING BACK THE PROFESSOR
Just cause he's dead doesn't mean he can't come back 👀👀👀👀
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
"welcome on and all..." me: :D "to the season finale!" me: :(((
WHAT!? NOOOOOO this can't end like this!!! Omg I really didn't expect this🤦🏻‍♀️😳😳😳
extra props to the graphics team and editors for this episode… that ending was a fuckin magical trip!!!
spoiler alert     i actually threw my phone when the genie showed up on the jelly telly LMAO
Noo poor professor
...I don't know what to feel.  Ryan what have you done?!
You know I always thought Ryan was going to get the trophy in the series finale when the professor hangs up his adorable little pith helmet.  But not like this. Never like this...
I look forward to next season, "What Puppets May Come". Ryan traveling through hell to bargain with the devil to get Prof. back.
not me actually being pissed at ryan for the "death" of a puppet.
nah cuz im about to full on cry wtf
POSSESS ME DADDY!!!!
Is this going to be like Doctor Who? where a new professor takes over every few seasons?
Noooooooooooooooo!Professoooooor!!!!!!!!
Oh heck!
if the professor doesn’t come back i’ll genuinely be really sad, rest in peace my good man
If I‘m being tortured about „name your accomplices!“ and I‘m gonna be tortured and killed anyway I mean, may as well take out any random enemies on the way down. May as well just go „yeah Jeff Bezos helped me contact the devil“ bc I mean that‘s the same amount of evidence as what got ME tortured and killed. If I have to die I‘m taking some arseholes down with me, you know?
ryan: don't dance with the devil also ryan:
My heart is shattered. What an amazing season finale!
Disliked for whataburger slander
man i sure am glad there was no lore in this episode
I CANNOT STOP GRINNING LIKE A FOOL WATCHING THE END OF THIS FINALE, THIS WAS PURE ART
the professor is canonically WHAT
EXCUSE ME BUT HOW LONG HAS THE "RIP: HE'S HISTORY" MERCH BEEN IN THE SHOP???? TT_TT
tf
Honestly, I'm proud of Ryan. He deserves that trophy
that means no more seasons of puppet history??????????????????????????????? noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
what a wild ass finale jesus im gonna need 3-5 business days to process that.
Uh oh, time to pull an Orpheus - just don't look back, Ryan!
Honestly got really sad wtf
Aigh’t Asmodeus can stay until spooktober is over. Please have Professor come back soon I miss him already.
Professor: *lists the names of the demons who arrived* Me: *absently listening as I do an assignment* Professor: *lists my name* Me: wait WHAT
is it weird that i’m happy for Ryan
Y’all— I can’t… why am I so emotionally attached to the Professor?   Win him back, Ryan!! Bring him home!! 😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️
I'm a few minutes into the episode but I have to say, I swear I saw a movie loosely based on this on Shudder called The Devils. The story just seems so similar and yet very different.
IF THIS MEANT THE FINAL FINALE OF PUPPET HISTORY, I'M GOING TO HURT SOMEONE.
What just happened?! No. Down with the genie! Save the professor.
When your history professor becomes your Music idol
Ok but him calling Sara his moon and stars had me😭😭
There’s an exploitative horror film based on this story staring Vanessa Redgrave called The Devils (1971)!
THERE'S LORE?!
I love this show - 90% of the topics are things I’d never heard of but are so wild that I’m shocked they aren’t more commonly known
i knew ryan was being hella suspicious all season
Man when the shows are awesome they fly by.
I fell asleep during End Game. I was on my feet ready to throw hands by the end of this dude! 👏🏾👏🏾
RIP PROFESSOR 😱🥺😭💔  but in a serious note… we still getting another season or…? 👀
Looks around: WE HAVE TO SAVE THE PROFESSOR GUYS!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
OH NO PROFESSOR OH GODS RYAN WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
Hey, you guys are starting to get good at this.  The musical bit needed more metal though
my moon and stars? 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
(Canonically dead FYI) My bf: “😱what are they gonna do now!?😨”
Does this mean no more puppet history? 🥲
That jellybean has done something to Ryan I swear.... if that jellybean is somehow part of the professor... is there gonna be some professor possession in the next season to get himself back.... hmmm
PROFESSOR NOOOOO, WHO WILL TELL THE LITTLE FUZZY FACTS OF HISTORY NOW
this is the second worst thing y’all have ever done, the first was telling us that story about the dude covered in tiny ears or whatever
Do not and I mean DO NOT make me hunt down a fucking genie to wish the professor back to life.. plot twist next season is the devil teaching Ryan and the professor trynna reach Ryan as a ghost only he can see because he spent so much time on buzzfeed unsolved and bring him back because he actually misses him
nooooooo
ryan killed the professor, crush his feet with boots of fire !!
R-I-P to a real one.
Dude, wtf was this ending hsuahsua! I'm interested to see how they're gonna start up next season XD
Oh my god... Ryan killed the professor... YOU BASTARD!!!!!!
Whataburger demon sucks
I recommend the film The Devils from 1971 based on this event filmed in glorious gratuitous 70 madness for those who where interested in this story.
NOOooOOoOOooOoooOOOOOOoooo
wow did not expect the drama
I was having a great morning until I didn't. "Canoninly-" THANKS FOR CRUSHING MY WILL TO LEARN
does this mean we’re getting a substitute teacher for next season?
god i love this stupid fucking puppet show lmao save the professor ryan. save him and maybe you can save your poor damned soul.
No.
Breaking News: Fossils discovered that seem to be of a small fluffy animal with human-ish limbs and a satchel?
The wikifeet Watermark!
Utterly fantastic! The Professor may be dead but I have a feeling of Long live The Professor!! Hang on.. does this mean that Ryan will be the focus of True crime or supernatural for what he's done?
The whole fuckin cast of obey me was possessing those nuns
Someone Call Robert Eggers to make this a movie!
Oh my god! Whaaaat! Is this really how it all ends?!?! Noooo!
canonically dead?! well shit
Holy fuck
The professor will be back right?
Son of a b
Ryan didn't write Ricky Goldsworth because Ricky is already at the helm.
I am a grown ass adult who has to be at work in the morning and I’m sitting in my room fully weaping over a puppet on YouTube I don’t know what are in those jellybeans but there magic is far reaching
I-... I gotta leave for work in ten minutes guys... You can't make me cry over a puppet after such a banger song... Nooo...
I knew Ryan was bad news when he dissed Whataburger.
There will be another season right?
Has anyone seen Ken Russell's The Devils?
Is no one gonna bring up that asmodeus is the demon of lust or—
No. Not buying it. The professor will either be regurgitated by the dinosaur and make friends or pooped out. Either way, he'll make a jelly bean, eat it and be transmitted back to 2021. This is NOT the last of the professor!!!
WHAT THE HELL MAN. I JUST WANTED TO LEARN. None of of this ANIMOSITY BULLSHIT. now the professor is DEAD . WHAT THE FUCK. And im sure Ryan didnt MEAN TO KILL HIM, so i hope the professor can forgive him IN THE AFTERLIFE???????????????
What demons are haunting you?  Me: ....wedding.....planning!  ( #tunnofstress2022 )
Omg I was wearing Bluetooth headphones and they died just after Ryan said "I've done it" . Talk about timing.
41:01 RYAN GETTING JOKERFIED I'm fucking dead
Loving this!!!!!
Lighting one up for the Homie ❤️ R I P
RYAN HOW COULD YOU?? HE TRUSTED YOU
That...wasnt what I signed up for.
"canonically dead fyi"
also did the professor yell out BEEF BOYYY at 39:40???
Thank you for the warning regarding photosensitivity. :)  I came prepared
Cool video but why does Ryan look scared the whole time
they did not kill the professor just in time for new merch of him to come out
22:10 this is priceless
Uhm.... NANIIIIIIIIII!?!?!?!?!?
Noooooo....!!!! Not the Professor!!! 😭😭😭😭
Ryan saying whataburger was one of his demons is a mood
hey what the fuck...?
Prfoessor: pro-tip Me: *vivid flashbacks* "DON'T CRY, CRAFT!" Oh gosh sorry that just slipped out-
I love that his memorial photo is from wikifeet lol
well, that took a turn
I HOPE IT WAS WORTH IT RYAN 😭😭😭
POSSESS ME DADDY
i just cried...now you want me to cry again?? WATCHER WTFFFF AA
Should do an episode on Crazy Horse
NOOOOOOOOOO
bro who got you crying like that?  This...
But....the Professor can't die....right? O.O Maybe Ricky Goldsworth will get vengeance?
Two things.  1. What the fuck??? I spent the last 10 minutes frozen with a horrified expression on my face and I only realised after the video had played out 2. I think Puppet History will be back for another season??? If so, can I request Agent Garbo/Juan Pujol Garcia, Aimo Koivunen, or 'Mad Jack' Churchill? They all have Puppet History energy
IM SORRY WHAT. I. WHAT
can't get over how funny it would have been if Asmodeus came out to sing, and just looked like the Professor wearing a demon horns headband.
How dare you kill professor! I hope for a new season anyway but who is gonna run it ...
Peep the joker edit at the end
Did ya'll just kill off The Professor??? Was it worth it, Ryan?? What will happen now?? I'm traumatized for life!!
The next season is gonna be a ride and a half!
I am so upset!!
Thanks Watcher. Got a grown adult crying over a puppet. Thanks for this.  Also is Ryan going to teach the class now in his quest to find the genie to fix his mistake cause RYAN THAT WAS DEFINITELY A MISTAKE
Well, Puppet History fans, we got our lore... but it cost us The Professor...
Nooooooooo, professor!!!
Love love love how the memorial picture of the prof had a wikifeet watermark, that really killed it for me lmao
Oh my God I’m gonna miss the professor and it’s all Ryan’s fault
THIS CANT BE THE END #BRINGBACKPROFESSOR
this is fucking incredible
man i love these episodes, whens the next season come out i cant wait. also as if u guys really killed the professor
4:24 i thought there was gonna be something written
DevilPuppet for new host +1
WIKIFEET???? WHAT
I'm getting Unus Annus vibes...
Why is no one talking about how ryan just slandered Whataburger
always love the lore and story that comes with shane madej
I'm starting to think the professor is racist against whatever Ryan is! Thats not okay, professor. Everyone deserves a  fair chance.
EXCUSE ME
a hell nah, i know Ryan ain't talking bad about whataburger
The Professor's subtle shade to unsolved had me choking!
Spoilers Sweetie:      Professor canonically dead?    Well, I reject your reality and substitute my own!
Can’t wait for the season premiere where father Tom shows up and has an epic battle to the death with the devil to save the professor
Shane needs an album
Missed opportunity of Ryan not to put down Ricky Goldsworth being one of his demons.
The Joker paint on Ryan was *chef's kiss*.
✨ manifesting ryan’s hero arc in saving the professor and becoming genuine friends with him ✨
Spoiler warning:      I can’t believe the Professor is fucking dead
I.....I need a moment.... What have you done Ryan.....what have you done....
IM SCREAMINGGGHSHJHSFHKJSHHJDFSHJSKJ im devastated but im also laughing my ass off at the clown makeup overlay on ryan's face 😭😂😂
I love how far they've come with this series.
at least now Shane & Ryan is on the same page.
Please tell me that we will be getting another season.
Canonically Dead Definition:  In many games, when the player character dies, he or she simply respawns, or the game resets and the character is alive again.
Eeeeeeee!  The trio of singing demons has to be my favorite puppet guests yet!  That’s awesome!
is this the last episode of the puppet history ? can we never get some sweet sweet knowledge ever again?
no body:  Absolutely nobody:  sister jean: Alright girls, here's the latest gossip in town-
ohhhhhh shiitttttttttt
The best season finale EVER
Ryan, you son of a bitch. Are you proud of what you’ve done?   A goddamn masterpiece of a finale. Well done everyone!
"I do not have experience with demons bc they're not real" she really IS shane's soulmate
Professor I'll possess you anytime - just summon me.
wait, so is this like a series finale?????
ok but can we talk about how the professor called sarah his “moon and stars” 🥺🥺
the fuck is there a wikifeet watermark on the proffesors image?
They freaking killed the professor!!!! PH was the only reason I'm living!!!!
Ryan after getting the trophy  :I’ve one but at what cost
I say this in the nicest way possible, but what the fuck? Ryan you treacherous dog, I knew he was planning something but I wasn't expecting that.
I'm gonna start saying "Possess me daddy" to my boyfriends from now on.
I know this isn't about the video, but I hope since it's October they'll bring out more Are You Scared? videos! It would be so fitting for the spookiest of months!
“Absolutely not. AHHHHHbsolutely NOT!” Got me like I be saying that every day when I step into work. 😂😂😂 Sounds like folie a deux strikes yet again. I love how this is a frequent topic on puppet history, somehow.
Okay so if this is the end of puppet history i'm suing
Ryan was vividly remembering the time Shane stole a whole bridge from a goat demon
I though the professor would start the next season off with prehistoric history lessons some how… but he really did get eated by dat T- Rex huh?
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Excellent work, all around, what a finale! I have feelings, thoughts, and SO MANY QUESTIONS. Well done.
Just watched the Ken Russel movie.
Cannonicaly dead 😭
The film nerd inside me spent the whole episode saying "Shane's been watching Ken Russell's The Devils, hasn't he?"
Season finale already? Feels like there's only been like 3 episodes lol
This better not be the end because I really like this show
I’ve been binge watching puppet history and didn’t even notice this was recently uploaded, I hope the professor is okay
canonically dead? well, i reject your canon
PROFESSOR??????
Ryan noooo
I love everything about the C-Dawgs bit - the original joke, the meta bit, the animations...
Professor....😭😭😭😭
Pull a Dr Bright scenario and transfer his consciousness through the satchel??
Hey, wait.... Please tell me this isn't the end of Puppet History and the Professor.... :'(
NO PROFESSOR😭
I'm sorry but tHE WIKI FEET WATERMARK?
Nooooooooo
Last season?
one of us has been pronouncing asmodeus wrong
"Uriel--" me: "wait, Uriel?" *does a quick search to make sure I'm right*  "Yes, Uriel, the *archangel of God* I wasn't wrong these nuns are nuts! " Ryan: "what"
The girl is so closed minded, it's sad, lol
RYAN YOU MONSTER! harsh mang- Please, there must be a stupid LAPD loophole here right?!?
Kinda expected Ryan to write Shane as the demon tormenting him
Is this the end of puppet history 😢😭
My heart is broken😭😭😭😂😭😭😭😭😭
Love Sera, am a little concerned for the professor..
i have no words.
The clown makeup on Ryan as it faded out made me cackle
i am heartbroken
i am heartbroken
I can’t even describe my frustration
:(
Shit was that the series end?
Not me deciding to watch this exactly 40 minutes before my actual uni class
THE PROFESSOR IS DEAD??? NOOO
NOOOOOOOOO PROFESSOR 😭😭😭😭😭😭
My sanity. Give it back
Better post credits scene than Marvel
Noooooo.... Ryan, what have you done? 😰😨
they legit killed him off oh my god
hello?????
Great story arc. Ryan gotta work on his Kayfabe tho.
bro I just wanted a fun lil story about possession
jesus
*(Canonically Dead FYI)*  EXCUSE ME WHAT
::SCREAMS::   literally the most devastating thing I have ever seen and I survived a few seasons of Game of Thrones.
11:36 "Celine Dion" as said by Sean Connery
YOU BRING BACK MY GOD DAMN PROFESSOR SHANE MADEJ.  YOU BRING HIM BACK TO TEACH US MORE
Man, next season's gonna be /wild/. I'm putting my money on "rescuing the professor from hell".
Did they just reveal that one of the professor’s wishes was to meet Whoopi Goldberg?
Dear god what did I witness
Asmodeus you say? *Obey Me stans have entered the chat*
nope nuh uh I don’t believe it NOT UNTIL I SEE NEXT SEASON WILL I BELIEVE THAT HE IS DEAD I CHOOSE TO BELIEVE THEY’RE PULLING A THANOS SNAP AND HE’LL BE BACK😠
I’m sorry Ryan but Whataburger is a blessing not a curse.
.... is this the end? Is there no more puppet history now?????
*Buzzfeed Unsolved Supernatural Final Season* - "We know it's your fault!  But the ghoul boys will hunt the demon and bring back the professor!"
I nominate the Gay Oars as the new hosts of Puppet History
what the fuck is wrong with you people im crying over a puppet
hey uh. can we talk about the uh wikifeet watermark on that picture of the professor I feel like we looked over that one a bit
R.I.P Professor McNasty. I hope Ricky Goldsworth is happy 😢
I honestly think this is the greatest episode of puppet history ever it was a roller coaster of emotions
What if next season Ryan is in an alternate universe type deal. Then he wins an episode but, by doing so, realizes something isn't right and spends the rest of season trying to get to the bottom of things?
That wasn't Ryan at the end. That was Ricky Goldsworth.
the show HAS to come back. right. they said season finale, not the show finale. right.
This finale is such a roller coaster of emotions. I kennat asdfghjkl
Shane in demon voice"possess me daddy'
YES! YES!!! THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PIECES OF HISTORY
Bro Ryan better either make a deal with the devil or a deal with the genie to get the professor back or imma riot
The last episode of the Hot Doga ended with Maizey and crew going back in time.  What if this is all a long and alaborate way for Shane to bring back the Hot Doga...
Well... ... ... That escalated quickly... ... ... I mean, that got out of hand fast! 🤯😳
I loooooove this show! It's so creative! I really appreciate all the effort and talent put into creating each episode. Thank you so much!😊
I'm the 200th thousand viewer.
Ryan really worries me sometimes…
They better announce there will be another season quick or i fear there’s going to be a riot!
lol what if that last jelly bean turned ryan into a puppet and thats how he hosts next season
RIP to a real one. 💙
Profesor.... NOOOOOO    Why am I crying over a puppet....
I feel like these stories where the drama of the day. They didnt confirm it or believe it most likely but there was nothing going on and it was good for the town, which meant more money and a bigger reputation.  Ps. I came here for puppet history but that ending was legit outta nowhere xD Did not see that coming xD
Well, shit.
"ALL HAIL THE WATCHER!"
Guys, they were clearly alluding to the end of Infinity War with some of Ryan's last words ("What did it cost?" "Everything"). That's probably foreshadowing for season 5. Also, remember that God is reachable by rotary phone
OH MY GOD  HE FUCKING DIED
Nooooooo! Professor, come back!
That ending line was… haunting,
Ryan is possessed by In-N-Out which is why Whataburger made him sick
Ok finished the video and WHAT THE FUCK
Am I gonna go to hell if I admit that SatanPuppet is adorable?
How come no one is talking about the wikifeet watermark over the professor's picture
If only the professor was nicer to Ryan
How dare you make me feel things, Puppet History. How dare you 😭
They did not just make an ELO inspired bop for the finale!!!
bring back Garrett Watts on the show! :D
When Ryan says “I’ve done it”  Chills
What if the Jellybeans are what keeps the professor from being taken over and letting other things take over.
DUDE(S)!!…… wth man …
Nooooo! this better not be the end of Puppet History! Ryan you ruin everything!
Wait....did they say this was the last season of puppet history??
NO PROFESSOR!!!!! please tell me he'll be back im traumatized
An intriguing mystery, no doubt. It was a real... Loudun-it
So you killed of the most successful character on your channel.  …..k.   Makes sense I guess.
WHAT
What… 👁👄👁
Oh that poor man😢
*Ricky Goldsworth is lurking in the background because Ryan is ignoring him*
omg I was so sad on season opening when they said there was no lore, this made me laugh a lot. Althought.... he's not _dead_ dead right?? right????
o7
This whole episode hit all at once and now I need a solid nap 💀💀☠️
I’m just gonna be over here super sad singing my heart will go on. 😪
What gets me is that they know we are emotionally invested in this little puppet man.
com on get it lol
The fuck you mean 'canonically dead FYI?' Better make him canonically undead! I am invested in this show! Damn it!
What WHAT Pro...professor?? Ok they haven't canceled this show have they? It's the best thing on YouTube.
I had to pause and be offend because we don’t have a lot going in Texas but Whataburger is a legend for us! I cannot……. Seriously sad to hear this and needing a moment
F
...no ...no, that's too sad, Professor getting eaten by a T-rex, nooo... sad day, indeed miss you Professor :(
So quick note abt the plague. It wasn’t a virus it was a bacteria. You dont build immunity to bacteria you can get the Black Death again and again. The reason it came in waves was bc it would burn through entire populations and then come back bc survivors were just as filthy as the dead
"Now since this is not one of those lazy shows that leaves things unsolved..." PROFESSOR THE DISRESPECT
As a Texan, hearing Ryan say "what a burger" and not "waterr burger" evokes me deeply.
i CAN'T believe they actually edited in the goddamn jokerfication for ryan
ok….. his memorial photo is from wikifeet 😭😭😭 it has watermarks on it omg
LOL Ryan and ~the Professor~ are so much nicer to each other when Sarah is the guest  idk what it is but this episode gave me v strong hotdaga vibes
*After seeing the ending*: . . .          . . .                . . . So that's it then.  The series is done.  This is how it ends.  Because I'm really not sure how you're gonna come back from that.  Rest in peace little buddy. You were an absolute asshat to Ryan. Let's get that straight; you were no saint. But you didn't deserve that kind of end. I did learn a lot from you, and I did love this series, and for that, you will be missed.
Is it also a sneaky little promotion to the next buzzfeed supernatural. Mr professor?
What. Omg, the last 10 minutes. My heart is broken.
RYAN. WHY.
NO
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Ryan saying not to dance with the devil but he did! Oh my god! And professor being gone? In front of sarah?! What the heck is happening! I'm crying! Professor please come back.    P.S. I hope there's another season and I'm so excited
sarah: what did it cost? me: everything. ryan: everything. me again: SHUT THE FUCK UP—
i cried
PHOSPHORUS FUCKED HERE
What the heck was this episode and why did I love it so much?
I refuse to believe he is dead. No way. It was an imposter. The professor was acting odd the entire episode.
This is my favorite show on YouTube. The finale was SUPERB and delivered on the storyline that was built throughout the season. I cannot wait for next season already!! The sheer time that must be spent on research, writing, props, editing, etc. …is probably insane.
Never thought that the season finale will be in Top 10 Sad Anime Betrayal.
Whew. Shane is going to be so happy to hear the guy that's been hitting on his girl got eaten by a T-Rex.
don't worry y'all that's only one canon death he's got two left
professor?!?
JUSTICE FOR THE PROFESSOR
Hm. I have decided that canon is a lie.
The LOOOOORE!
Aww :( I'm assuming this is obviously the last puppet theatre episode. I really liked the series, and I'm sad to see it end.
Way to get rid of the best member of the Watcher team. T_T
7:28 to 7:40 is funny af
I loved so much this season, but maybe...don't use so many flashes for the season finale? 😭😭 I'm fine loosing bits of shows here and there, but even if my headache was worth it, try to use less flashes for important parts? ☹ Aside from that... I am amazed at the quality of this show 👌🏽
He’s not dead tho right? Right?!?!?!
If I don't see the professor in season 5 I'm unsubbing. 😟😠
NOOOOOOOOOOOO
What have you done Ryan! 😭😭
this is like gene from the hot daga all over again I'm heartbroken
How the heck do you not like Whataburger?
*cough  coough* hotdaga continuation plz *cough cooough*
But what about next season?
NOOOOO
HOLYYYY THE GRAPHICS ON THIS YOU GUYS ALSO IM SOBBING
Can't believe The Professor stole Shane's girl tho...
Joker Ryan?
There is a film about this called, The Devils.
Did anyone else see the joker face paint on Ryan?
A-S-M-O-D-E-U-S. Brilliant, my favorite so far
I predict Ryan is gonna call God from that phone that directly connects to him and they're gonna team up to get the professor back. Maybe he'll trade in his trophy as a sacrifice for some drama
I can't believe they just killed his ass
So Surin took the Shane Madej approach and got immediate results?   S U S
We need to find the preserved remains of the professor and resurrect him
oh fizzle stickssssss! (but, he'll be back, right? the little blue fuzzy being will be back?)
So is this the series finale as well😢😢😢
RIP     (he'd better not actually be dead i love that little fuzzy blue dude)
professor: "well well well, if it isn't the consequences of my actions."
🖕🏼you Shane. Whataburger is gods gift to the world it probably tasted bad cause you were in Austin but per texas law I'm not allowed to let you bad mouth whataburger without saying something about it even if it was in austin.
no no no no no no no The Professor isn't dead the Professor isn't dead, he's just stuck in dino times. Just in time for a Jurassic World Sponsorship.
WHY DO MY FAVORITE CHARACTERS ALWAYS DIE
Another G off to that Thug Mansion in the Sky with Pac, Biggie and Norm Macdonald  RIP Professor 🙏🏼
Rewatching this episode hits different
so... we gonna save the professor right? we need that little blue puppet to teach us about history and line up some killer musical guests.
what the actual fuck just happened
i'm soooo excited to see what the next season is gonna be like!! this is so intriguing!!
I want to like this video....but I can't. How could you kill the Professor????
PROFESSOOOOOOOOOOOR 😭😭😭😭😭
I actually liked the genie lore and wanted more of it
Ive grown so accustomed to The Professor as a living person that I forget it's just Shane with a blue puppet
In the words of Kelly Kapoor, “I have a lot of questions, number one how dare you?”
I now need a series about Ryan realizing that his friendship with the Professor is more important than the trophy he had wanted so bad since season 1 and thus trying to revive the Professor in some way _or else_
Noooooooo professor nooo
At the beginning of the video, was that Ricky Goldsworth?
Funny shit ever !!! Love ya guys!! 🙏💯😁😉Looking forward to more Funnys!! Next season !!!! And more!!! My stomach is so hurting. So much of Laughter!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂💯From Mari🦋😁😂😂😂😂✌❤ You need to make your own reality show!!!🙏💯❤
Can you please drop a Puppet History album on Spotify I need to always listen to these songs😂😂
i like how his obituary photo is from wikifeet
ah another episode confirming that i love sara rubin
top 1 puppet history betrayal. omg. the plot twist. omg the cliff hanger. what a fantastic ending to this season. looking forward to what comes next.
Yes!! Also no!!! I hope it was worth it Ryan! The genie has had his day and now the Professor is dead, now who shall bring us our history? Satan?! I kinda hope so, maybe some time travel could rewrite canon >.> but that probably wishful thinking. R.I.P in Pepperonis Professor.
You bring the professor back!!
The ending is just me going oh no oh no OH NO!
OMG I love you guys.
Bring him back dammit
The newspaper boy puppet is really a regular in this series
can we cancel ryan again
I'm so traumatized by this ending...  Professor... <wails> <sobs>
Not me sitting here as a pastor laughing my tush off at them making fun of the church.... cause most of it is pretty accurate (mostly to the medieval church, but not excluding the modern church either)
😱 but also 🤣
This is better than MCU
,,,,,,HELLO???
It is cute that Shane ended the season with both his partner in life and business. The season ends with friendship!
Why does Ryan always look damp?
I still love Ryan but never have I had my heart broken so much omg😭😭
whst if the nuns were just girlbossing
Yo what the hell? Watcher, Ryan, what have you done!? How could you do this? We're gonna fix this, right? Like we'll find a way to bring him back, right!?
Idk if I'm ok with the professor bring canonical dead...
Bruh, puppet history was my favorite thing on this channel though.  Rip blue Elmo
what the hell did i just witness
Noooo!!!! Why???? 😭😭😭😭
*canonically dead fyi*
oooooh that's why the camel said "Don't trust Ryan Bergara"
Wtf are we gonna do now..
@filmtheory please do an episode on this
I like the song! It has such a fun beat
Lmfao i hate y’all, he better come back as a ghost
bet ryan becomes the professor next season, and he does the entire thing in his unsolved voice
What if prof gets pooped out like a little jellybean, and as an immortal he lives thru time till he gets back to this moment and that’s how he got his knowledge?
ryan: roasting whataburger my pea brain: huh kinda wanna go grab whataburger now
Shouldn’t they be called semesters instead of seasons???
Um excuse me this was supposed to the SEASON finale not the series finale y’all better resurrect the Professor
Really don't like this guest speaker sorry
Ladies and gentlemen!! FRANCE.
can't believe ryan didn't mention ricky goldsworth
I CAN’T BELIEVE THEY KILLED OFF THE PROFESSOR! WTF! I love these videos so much 😭
does this mean no more puppet history??!? DD:
🗣I am HERE for the puppet lore! I’m tryna find our how my poor mans gets back to this...Err century?
holy shit
Leviathan? Naphthalim? Ok now I know those nuns were just making this stuff up. I double checked these names just in case, and I was mostly right-- Leviatan is a variation of Leviathan, which is a sea creature mentioned a couple times in the Bible. Naphthalim is the name of one of the twelve original founding fathers of the twelve tribes of Israel. Nothing demon-like about either the sea creature or the person.
So if the professor is canonically dead...does that mean...he is in Hell?...I mean I don't want to assume but you know we've all done some shady stuff. And if the devil is STILL there maybe Ryan can travel to Hell to like resurect him???
I went to an Ursuline highschool here. So... Yeah.
MICHAEL STUHLBARG FANS RISE UP
So... Is it over? My life just lost its meaning! What tf am i supposed to do now?!
my boi :(((((
Gasp* you can’t kill the professor! Aw :( Tell me the Dino poops him out for the next season! 💩
Thank you so much for the photo sensitivity warning at the beginning. As some one who has photo sensitive/ reactive epilepsy you have no idea how many times I watch videos on YouTube that have flashing lights and start feeling bad or get worried that something will happen. This simple warning helps so many people so thank you so so much!
this is the only episode i ever recall any f words gettin' cut out. is that a thing on youtube now? mebbe the captions have always been censored. hmm.
“So what demons are are currently possessing you?”  Ryan: Shane Madej
12:09 that’s a gd genie in the background!
Oh no, Professor! 🥺  Ryan, next time I’m in LA… it’s ON SIGHT 👊🏻
So uh...are we getting a substitute professor? I really need this class credit
Dafuq?!?!?
I will never emotionally recover from this finale
Ryan...you hurt my feelings....I'm mad at you...we have to save the professor now.
HUH??????????????????????????????????????????????????
Okay Ryan I’ll give you one chance to fix that Whataburger comment it’s the best thing known to man!!! Sincerely an offended Texan
i was absolutely expecting The Professor to have the last jellybean be one of the crazy gross ones so Ryan has this. really nice moment with The Prof and then chomps into a vomit bean
Genie genie jelly beanie
Was the professor's last words "Beef Boi"
Also rip to the realest and the baddest ☹️☹️
How many puppets were harmed in the making of this video
KATE NEVER GOT TO SAY GOODBYE
YES MORE PUPPET HISTORY!!!!
I was about to go back and watch some more episodes, but now I don't want to because they killed off the professor for no reason
I'm having a hard week, got a lot going on. I'm thinking, "Ooh, Puppet History will make it better." Then you kill the Professor. I think I'm owed some jelly beans and a freaking apology.
WTF!?! Why‽‽‽ 😭😭😭😭😭
Now that's a season finale! -Sara, probably
Guys he is dead. Look on their store 😭😭
… i was expecting more ska horse…
BROOOOOO THIS HAS TO BE A LIE NOOOOOOO PROFESSOR! WHYYYYYYY😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD TEACH ME HISTORY BETTER THEN ANY HISTORY TEACHER I EVER HAD. THIS IS SOME BS 😭😭😭
That ending left me speechless Just... Canonically? Huh? I want to forget the meaning of the word just for a moment of hope for the Professor...
The professor: ya know nuns! Totally rational, why would they believe in ghosts???
WAIT WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCKING FUCK?!?!?!?!?!?!??????!!???!?)$88)?!)5;?!&@@$?,;)?
This is giving very much Salam Witch Trails and that's sus
if the professor is actually dead im suing shane madej for my mental damages
...... pLEASE SAY SIKE   ;___;
Make my boy the professor a spotify or else watcher
Ghoul Boy Beef Boy, that's why we don't make deals with the devil... be careful of what you wish for
rip to a real one
What did you monsters do to my favorite fuzzy educator
SAAAAAARAAAAAA
DON'T READ THE COMMENTS BEFORE WATCHING THE SHOW.
The "okay. ready everybody?" was such a good touch!!
WTF. WHY. IM CRYING. I DO NOT ENJOY THIS.
So.....is Shane Asmodeus? Because that song was so on point.
No I love this show, don't tell me it's over
PROFESSOR! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
Truly a great experience.
DAMN YOU GENIE AND YOUR CANON
Nooooooooo! Professor!!!!!!!!!
Me: “Man I wonder if the tally system is going to work for Ryan this time.” *Checks time stamp and sees that there are still 8 minutes left in the video* “I have a bad feeling about this.”
I’m devastated.
But he can time travel 😭 He can save himself!!! 😭😭😭😭
NOOOO
i will riot until the professor comes back
“THE POWER OF CHRIST COMPELS YOU FRENCH GIRL!” shouldn’t have made me laugh as hard as it should have but it did
Oh my gosh! Thank you so much for the photo sensitivity warning!
Honestly, thank goodness for Shane and his need to inject his own little bit of fun into shows that are already baller. I need to know what happens next.
Does that mean Satan is our new Puppet History host? 🤔
NOOOO THE PROFESSOOOR
If this is the end of Puppet History or if Ryan doesn't go save the professor I will personally time travel, revive, and rip the Professor back into the present
France was pretty hopping back then they had possessions, the Beast, stolen necklace, and dancing plague.
Okay so clearly the last bit was a Gamora/Thanos Infinity War homage.  The words "canonically dead" are telling. Everyone who was dusted was canonically dead until End Game. The fact that I am analyzing clues in a YouTube show about the fate of a professor puppet is something I am going to have to talk about in therapy.
No!  The Professor!
I thought it was the possession of Lou Dobbs. A little disappointed.
NO PLS I DON'T WANT THE PROFESSOR TO DIEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Yes, yes I did burst into tears when Shane introduced Sarah as his moon and stars
What does this mean for puppet history?
series 5: Ryan embarks on an adventure to get the professor back
So... Is this their way to telling us that Puppet History is over?
oops time to fight shane
SPOILER:      Took me a couple of watches, but there is an overlay of the Joker's face overtop of Ryan's during that crossfade at the end there. Nice touch. :P
Is this what it feels to be high?? Btw nice season of puppet history😍
Is the Professor actually dead?
I set my alarm to watch this at 1am TWICE to watch it end like this??!!!! 💔
Absolutely jaw dropping season finale. Can’t get shit this good on Netflix.
So next season will be hosted by the Ghost of the Professor, who has been waiting literal eons for his chance to live again. The only way to save the Professor is for Ryan to collect the Infinity Jelly Beans which are hidden in the trophies of all the previous guests. Ryan has to defeat of the guests to get their cup. Slowly, Ryan comes to realize that the winner algorithm is in fact based not on points, but how much you care about the Professor.
This was the best episode so far. Editing, acting, all of it. A++++ WELL DONE
Please tell me we will get another season. This is straight up my fav show on the internet
NOOOOOO THIS CANT BEEEEEEE
Oh ye of little faith. Do yall really believe The Professor would fall to something like a T-Rex? Pfff. Nah, I don't think he'd go out like that. He'll be back.
28:01 I need this to be my notification sound so badly
PUPPET HISTORY BETTER NOT BE OVER I SWEAR TO GOD
Goodness the lore
Loved the infinity war reference
HOW DARE THAT STUPID GENIE DO THIS WTF
4:08 I had times like that in class and for my online classes. Just forget Im supposed to be taking some notes and I get kinda lost in the lecture. I'm going to be a counselor and I think I should work on that bc notes are important lmfaoo
28:27
beef boy becomes little boy blue
You know, I was thinking, “I like the Professor, but I miss seeing Shane’s face”… I don’t miss it so much any more…
Ryan what have you done!?
So when is Ghost going to cover the Asmodeus song?
How DARE you Ryan! Whataburger is  life.
no. NO. I REFUSE. BRING HIM BACK NOW. THIS IS NOT WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN. I WANT MY PROFESSOR BACK
BRO WHAT!!! What just happened!?!
Great show, love the effort and time put into this. Best show on YouTube, and this channel has so much Quality I'm surprised we are getting it for free!!
Imma need like 10 more seasons, STAT.
Soooo is this the end of puppet history forever??
Reading this notification made me think Unsolved Supernatural was back already god dammit
Love the stone cold plug for merch right after that ending XD
Ryan got Jokerfied !
Welp now I'm off to go cry for the loss of the only teacher I've ever enjoyed 🥲
that genie really does look so much like shane it's so weird
what. the fuck. just happened.
Sad its the season finale already. Hope next season has Timothy Dexter as an episode. Dude failed upwards like you wouldn't believe
Ryan's gotta Ryan.. sucks to lose the professor (temporarily, I hope).. but I am glad we finally got to see Ryan this season. :-)
This isn’t funny
I sure do hope this isn’t the end of the series
THE LORE!!
Shane has outdone the Hot Doga… even though he had to sacrifice The Professor to do it.
I was waiting for Ryan's victory but not like this!!!! XD oh no- Prof. became a snack!
This shit feel like a marvel movie, the cgi, the cinematography and THE PLOT 10/10 all around
Oh no Professor!!!!!!
THEY KILLED OFF THE PROFESSOR!!!!
This can’t be the end >:( I needed an episode w Shane as a guest but it’s not actually him it’s just another lanky white man saying he’s Shane >:(
i’m suing if this is the end of puppet history
crying screaming throwing up doing backflips like those wack nuns someone SAVE the LITTLE BLUE GUY or i'm gonna commit WAR CRIMES
Hmmm…. Maybe our next episode is on… Dinosaurs~? Mayhaps a certain Tyrannical sort?
On Supernatural the boys died frequently. It's a thing. When Hell is involved, lots of things can happen. Also, Marvel had a whole time travel situation to fix things. 100% Ryan will figure out how to fix it. How to get his everything back. ❤
NOOOOOO PROFESSOR!!!
Me: either the genie will come back, Ryan will win OR the professor will get possessed  Watcher: all of the above
the hot daga walked so professor genie lore could run
This is amusing, because I just had a conversation with my mom today about demon contracts and some of their holes that allow you to save people supposedly taken. Great timing!
LOOK. LOOK AT HOW THEY MASSACRED MY BOY.
Is this the end??? Stay tuned (Hopfully)
Noooooooooooooooooooo
NO!!! NOT THE PROFESSOR! 😭😭😭
So? No more puppet history? :(
"Asmodeus" has reached the top 3 list of my fave Puppet History songs.  And again, I can't get over how fitting Shane looks as an evil genie.
Noooooooooooooo!!!!! Professor!!!!
Noooooooooooooooo!
Fantastic finale, can't wait to see what happens next!
Is 31:18 a refrence to a song or did he just put a tune to his words for no reason? It actually sounded really good. Also that floating ball could have been like ball lightning or something, but then again it could have just been made up.
Love. Me. Some. Lore!
I have no words. This is worse than losing Santa as a child.
ok but horrific lore aside, the song slaps-
LOOK HOW THEY MASSACRED MY BOY!
Look what you did now, are you god damn happy Ryan?!!
Nooooooooooooooooo
next season is a dora the explorer type of thing with ryan and sara fining the genie and forcing him to give ryan the last wish, and ryan want the prof back. or something
Noooooooooooo
Just finished the episode and... exsqueeze? If *SPOILERS* that death was real I'm finna be really upset
Ryan what have you done?! I should not be this upset over a puppet! Watcher why?!
"My moon and stars!"  *SHANE.*
So... does this mean there isn't gonna be another season??? That makes me very sad if that is true.
WhaaaaaAAAAAAAT DO YOU MEAN CANONICALLY DEAD?!?!?! Is that allowed?????
Sarah: Ive never had an experience with demons because they dont exist Me: So you've never met Shane DemDemons Madej
Hell has an amazing online filing system but it’s all run by old people who have no idea how the internet works
EXCUSE ME ??????????????????????
WAIT. WAIT WAIT WAIT NO WAIT. WAIT SHIT OH MY GOD. NO WAIT
I don't get why Youtube decided to unsubscribe me from Watcher (but they still show up in Home when they are newly updated wtf)
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭   Edit: I'm haunting Ryan to avenge the professor
Funny to note, genies were derived from an old biblical tale of a demon trapped by King Solomon and granted wishes with the use of a ring. So maybe the genie here's an old pal of Scratch himself.
So Ricky isn’t a demon
How Sara started the C dogs bit before the professor said anything is perfection. 🤣
This sets the stage for ghost professor.
My prediction is we will have a replacement next season which build up to the return of the Professor in the finale
Does anyone else feel betrayed?
bruh what the fuck
I have SOOOOOOO MANY questions!
F for the professor we will miss him 🥺
10/10 ending. But if the professor doesn't come back I will riot
Professor Nooooooooo !!! 😫😭
“Your honor, this guy screamed when I stabbed him repeatedly in the balls with a needle”  “He got ghosts in his blood we should kill him about it”
Ryan, you get the professor back right now or so help me God
I kinda knew something was gonna befall the Professor. Either the Genie was gonna kill him (the bad ending) or he might die after giving away the final Jellybeans (this would have been the happy ending as he would have finally been with his wife and children in Puppet Heaven).   I felt something was off because he looked a little pale throughout the episode.
Shane Madej might be the greatest mind of our time.
wait what
Is...is nobody going to talk about how they gave Ryan joker makeup at 41:00???
I- the devil- I-  Professor🥺💙
I love this series so much
Man, the last few moments before the end was horrifying, ngl.
Ryan betrays the professor: Me: I saw this coming  Professor gets swallowed by dinosaur: Me: 😱 I didn’t see that coming!!!!
hey, uh. quick question. wtf?
I thought I was just a casual viewer until I found myself weeping for a puppet
Season finale. More like series finale am I right?
WHY?!??? 😭😭😭
My mouth is stuck wide open at that ending holy shit-
Nooooooooo ToT Professor!!!!!! P.S.- will this effect my GPA?
The professor referring to Sara as his ‘moon and stars’ makes me so happy 🥰
wait NO! Not the season finale already! And the Professor is now missing in time!? Or Maybe dead!? It can't be! It just cannot be!
Missing the ghoul boys😭 hopefully next year the team will start ghost/demon hunting again.
Did…did puppet history just end?
That episode tho... Chef’s kiss! 💋
I miss when Ryan was just a baby faced wide eyed believer :(
He better not be “canonically dead”!!
PROFESSOR NOOOOOO
I’m legit crying rn, this show has been my relief from everything going on and now 🥲 I’m going to go cry for awhile
RYAN BETTER GO ON A QUEST TO RESCUE/UNMURDER THE PROFESSOR
....I beg your damn pardon, did you just end Puppet History. I refuse. GIVE HIM BACK.
First Gene and now this....
😳you broke my heart 💔. We watch with anticipation as a family. Ryan cheaters never prosper
Professor nooooooo 😭😔
Can I get an F in chat for the professor?
If Ryan isnt the next "professor" and sneak in answers like "or C. Come out Genie I have a deal to make with u"
My personal demons: existential dread and executive dysfuntion
If anyone here plays "Obye Me" yall already know~ lmao
NO NO NO ...JUST NOOOOOOOOOOOO >>Cme back Professor..!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Pls don't end puppet history  plsssssssssss!!!
you better bring the professor back or i will RIOT AND DRAG RYAN TO HELL MYSELF
POSSESS ME DADDY merch when?
Hopefully this means the new season of Unsolved: Supernatural is on it's way.
OH MY GOD I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING!!
Wait so this isn't-  It's not over is it?  Oh god- RYAN WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
professor: you have any experience with demons Ryan, who has made a deal with actual Satan to screw over the professor: yeah edit: goddamn it the fucking wikifeet watermark got me
why not only did Ryan finally got a trophy, but he also got a whole lot of prove of the supernatural being real, and what did it cost? the3 professor! nice Ryan.
Ryan enlists his friend Shane to help him get the professor back, and then Shane gets killed/sacrificed right before the Professor appears.
i know i commented, "return ryans bloodlust" but like i didnt mean in this way, i meant in the haha funny way and now lil blue mans....dead? talk about hubris
That went from 0 to 100 real quick
anyone noticed how all the puppets turned into ordinary items? im dead
wow I'm actually super depressed now...
No one's gonna talk Abt how Shane called Sara his moon and star?
This was not how I imagined my Sunday night was gonna go! Professor please come back!
dope
well.
Dont worry to all those who sob for our little blue puppet friend. Remember he is immortal SO consider this the long way around.
WHY DID YOU GIVE HIM JOKER MAKEUP
MY JAW IS ON THE FLOOR NOOOOOO
My demons: Depression Loneliness  Anger Christopher
better than the Twilight Saga movies combined
LEVIATHAN AND ASMODEUS??? Damn that nun is lucky- (yes I’m talking abt their Obey Me counterparts)
The brief glimpse of clown makeup on Ryan's face and the Wikifeet watermark both *killed* me!
No no no… it can’t be…. He’s not de.. he’ll come back right? Come back… come back…💔
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO it can't be the season finale already!!!
Ryan!?! What have you done!?!?! You better go back to dinosaur times & get that fuzzy blue guy!!!
R.I.P. to the world's greatest history professor.😖😣😓😩😫😭😢😥😭😭😰😭😭
Wait so...no more Puppet History? NO MORE PUPPET HISTORY? HE'S ACTUALLY DEAD? F*ck you, I never thought I'd care so much about a puppet
Filing cabinet here before watching this ep. my mental stability is doing wonderful right now. My drawers have been recently polished and are very shiny. Will report my emotions after watching
I can’t believe we made it the whole season without ANY lore
Absolutely depressed I missed out on the Professor vinyl figure ):
Oh no professor!
This is high art.💕
The Professor's last words being "Beef Boi" really tugged at my heartstrings
😶🤯😵
WHAT
..... this isnt the end of it is it? if it is im gonna be SO fuckin pissed lol
F to the profffffffffffffffffffessor
was that a Thanos reference??
🖤🤎💜💙💚💛🧡❤
🤩😍🥰
Watcher i dont think you know how many hearts you just broke. I’ve now cried over a puppet. Is this what you wanted?  Ryan danced with the devil and look where it got us.
Ryans joker arc has begun
Theory: Next season is going to be puppet mystery with the devil taking to all the people in hell while Ryan works to get the professor back.  A girl can dream
OKAY WHERE’S THE /J THO HAHAAA……….
You literally cannot get rid of the professor... You can't do this to us!
WAS THE PROFESSOR PROTECTING RYAN BUT NOW RYAN IS TRAPPED AS HOST
WHAT DO YOU MEAN CANONICALLY DEAD WHAT HAVE YOU DONE RYAN NOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I can't believe ryan was in on it the whole time... but looking back on it now it definitely makes sense. I just hope, if ryan Does wind up helping get the professor back in some way, he turns into a puppet at some point before turning back. puppet ryan would be incredible to see
If the professor had a skill share class I would take it.
AWE HELL NAW! literally. ;'( RIP professor you will be greatly missed!
*RYAN*
love how the one demon they decided to be the puppet is the demon of lust
I knew those demons would be important!
Sooooo this is just a SEASON finale right? Right??
Maybe the true jelly bean trophy, was The Professor's friendship all along?  RIP in pieces Professor.
WHY AM I CRYING
WHAT IN THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED
IM SO SAD
Between the clown makeup over lay and the wikifeet watermark I am d y i n g
you people are insane. i hope you're happy now that you destroyed my spirit, tell me was it worth it????
:"(   Noooooooooooooo
this is my villain origin story
What?! This can’t be the end! What happens now! This is one of the best shows I seen! Professor don’t leave us!
Best. Episode. Ever.  Thank you
"This isn't one of those lazy shows that leaves things unsolved..." #Burn
so... is the professor a ghost now?
actually that was not okay 😩😔  bring back that fuzzy little blue man or else !!!
as a fellow angelino, i appreciate ryan talking shit about whattaburger
THIS WAS A LOT TO PROCESS BUT I LOVE IT
Hahaha that was fun! Now they have to rescue him!
Maybe... maybe the Professor's ability to poop out jellybeans will cause the dinosaur to get sick and poop out the Professor and... and everything can go back to the way it was.  Right?  RIGHT???
Canonically dead?!?! No!!!!!!!!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
he-he'll be okay right...?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN CANONICALLY DEAD FYI
Sorry for possessing the 16th-century nuns.... gotta get your kicks in somehow though...
ryan really had to make a deal with the devil to win 😭
39:27 😭😭😭😭😭😭
NOOOOOO PROFESSOR HOW COULD U RYAN
Noooooo......NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.... 🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️🅾️
Oh man,, this ending
Devil episodes next season?
We love some spooky tales with boys 👻❤️🎃
Nooooooooo!!!!!!! Not the Professor.
WHAT ARE YOU FOR REAL!? I HATE EVERYTHING NOW THAT'S IT I'M EATING THE RICH AND THE POOR AND ALL OF YOU FOR DOING THIS TO MY BOY
theory for next season: ryan has to host the show, which now has two rotating guests (shane is on an episode), using the Professor's unused lesson plans. each episode will have an appearance of the Professor via jelly telly in which he gives a question while trying to outrun dinosaurs and is passive aggressive to ryan
That was a really legit Don Pardo impression.
STOOOOPPP this killed me...just like the professor
What :(
ugh i love this show so much,, thankyou for always making me smile, everyone on the team is fantastic :)) love u all!
Did Ryan's face get joker-fied at the very end or am I seeing things?
If I'm not mistaken, the writing on the devil contract was matched to Jeanne des Anges in the end.
Did y’all see the clown makeup on Ryan?
NOOOOOOOOOO
Rynosaurs: A small price to pay for salvation.
Demonic possessions??!! You better have the proper scientific explanation!
I SWEAR I HEARD THE NAME RICKY GOLDSWORTH WHEN THE PROFESSOR WAS REMOVING HIS POWERS AM I GOING CRAZY?? I CANT BE THE ONLY PERSON WHO HEARD IT
wait why am I actually heartbroken speechless devastated
PROFESSOR NOOOO!!!!!!
Umm Guys what does “canonically” mean…. He’s not really gone right ?? RIGHT??
we need C-Dogs merch lol
Noooooooooo!!!!!! Professooooooor!!!
so basically we are gonna have puppet satan teaching next season till ryan undoes all this is what you are saying shane “maybe a demon” madej
WIKIFEET?????
te fuckinghjdkhjdgskgdsjkh clown makeup
i have a lot of questions first of all how dare you
"canonically dead FYI" hurt so so bad to read
Idk I feel like Ryan could've just grabbed the trophy from the professor, considering he doesn't have any bones. It's seeming like he didn't think this through smh /j
1:33 just reminds me of Ryan's infamous quote, "where's my holy water?"
Maybe don't trust the devil. That's some pretty accurate life lessons
Has Ricky Goldsworth taken over because "Ryan" didn't mention him as a deamon, meaning only one thing..
Professor! Nooooooooooo! (crying for a puppet. what is my life?!?)
Ive been here since s1 ep1 and this rlly hurt
No!!! Whataburger is great!
this song SLAPS. shane write songs for broadway please
Holy... I'm crying in a bathroom. There are no words to describe whatever is going on in my head right now
WHAT
o7 Professor.
ryan should have written down ricky goldsworth as a demon inside him
I believe Ken Russell directed a film based off these events called the devils, it’s was considered a controversial film for it’s time due to the negative portrayal of the church
The professor is dead? What? My eyes are leaking water🥺
So theres obviosly a whole lot going on but "this isnt some stupid show where things remain unsolved" deserves a whole lot more recognition
they specifically didnt animate the professors bag falling into the dinosaurs mouth when they could have so maybe the bag is important in the next episode  (edit: they also added the sound affect of it falling so it probably takes a part in the lore beside storing his little blue loafs of poo)
Wait what did I just watch!!! The fact you added the canonically dead part makes me even more nervous!
くそ！
BRING BACK THE PROFESSOR PLEASE
I am very photo sensitive. Every time I see a photo, I see it.  With my sensitive eyes.
I’m just speechless like what did I just watch?
So worth the wait!!! I predict the next season will be hosted by another puppet and Ryan will win every episode but it won’t feel right.
its over???
not me, a whole adult, crying over the “death” of a lil blue puppet
DD: no way you end series like this, there's gonna be more right? Professor's just having a monstro-style home... 3:
Canonically...dead? );
Man! What a season 3 LOST, Season 4 CASTLE, downer of a finale this year!  Not only THAT,  but he never posted the midterm results for history class, so my millionaire father canceled my tuition and I had to make money throwing parties with some kid that looked like he got lost on the way to get fast food. This  is terrible, but the video wasn't! I really think Dean Vernon is going to win this time Flounder... ROAD TRIP!
Ryan forgot Ricky goldsworth whenhe was listing his demons
btw spoilers ahead for the video.  Just letting you guys know that the demon Asmodeus was actually in love with with a woman called Sarah, Asmodeus also killed seven of Sarah's husbands all on their wedding night, and the special guest is called Sara Rubin, not spelt the same but still. Our musical puppet Asmodeus and who won? Ryan did after seven videos about season 4 of puppet history just like, Sarah's husband who overcame Asmodeus, Tobit. Sounds very far fetched ik but it's a very cool coincidence.
Yay! Love when I can watch the professor
Wait. Wait. He .he is ok tho. Right. Right?
there's gotta be a way the professor comes back. idk, it just doesn't feel like that's where they leave it.
A puppet show on YouTube has no business having all this production quality,  story telling, and lore. You guys are killing it ❤. RIP Professor
Ryan should turn into a puppet with Shane and rescue the professor in the cretacius (I can't spell).
RYAN what have you done
I hope this isn’t the series finale because I love the professor
Professor nooooooooooooooooooooo
OH NO PROFESSOR!!!!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
nooooo i hate it!! PROFESSOOOOOORRRRRR!!!
steven lim you better get ryan to fix this right now(please)
Man I'm a 30 year old woman crying over a fuckin puppet HOW DARE YOU
Three months pregnant and crying over a puppet.  I will never recover now. What am I supposed to to tell my child?   "Mummy, why is my name Professor?"   "It's too soon to tell you kiddo, but one day... One day I shall share with you the joys of the professor..."
I cannot physically handle this I will be running away to live in the woods now
This series never fails the make my day!!!!
...WTF....
OH MY WHAT?!?!?!
Wow i never thought I'd say this but i now hate Ryan 😭
This was great!!! You guys keep stepping it up each season!
I was enjoying the genie stuff, thought it was funny and cute bit of background lore. NOW LOOK AT IT. How dare you!!
I'm like-- I've been laugh crying for like 2 straight minutes over that ending x'DDDD To think Ryan's behavior had been foreshadowing this the entire time.
I have a feeling the guilt is gonna eat Ryan alive and he's gonna find that dreaded Genie, trade his trophy for the Professor's return. Xmas wish, bring the professor back!
WAIT a minute I think this episode had LORE in it! daw come on man I thought you were SERIOUS about completely changing the nature of the show and uprooting an entire plotline for the small percentage of people who didn't want it 😩     that being said RYAN WHAT THE FUCK DID YOJ DO TO THE PROFESSOR?"!?';#?$;"?"!:?!'
I´m going to miss the professor, one of the few teachers that didn´t put me to sleep.
Nooooooo!
Whose idea was the fucking joker makeup on Ryan at the end lmao
RYAN WON THE TROPHY BUT AT WHAT COST???????
i did "lets just be wizards" for 3 years and missed this topic.
Today I was watching a documentary on the movie The Devils, based on this events in this events. The movie was banned and is very hard to find by legal manners.
CANONICALLY DEAD???
next season could y'all pls cover the public universal friend (aka the p.u.f) and their shenanigans? more ppl need to know abt them
I'm thoroughly convinced Ryan was influenced by Ricky Goldsworth to get that trophy. He didn't include Ricky on the list of demons possessing him to cover his tracks.
When Ryan is talking about his demons I imagine a clown car with a bunch of demons coming out of it XD
I only just started watching these Puppet History videos and this happens??!! No no no no! It’s only a joke of some sort!
No regrets Ryan!!! He had it coming!!!
This story must have a movie
never thought i’d see the day where i cry over a puppet “dying” (bc i hate puppets but not the ones shane makes!)
pROFESSOR NOOOO
w h a t
after so much grieving i have to grieve over a puppet!?
Season over already !!?? Oohhhh nooooo
*wails “NOOOOOOOO”*
I cannot believe my eyes 😶
Sara doesn't believe in demons. No wonder Shane loves her.
I CALLED IT!
Dang, Asmodeus should have asked for some help from AMDUSIAS if you're one of the five people who know what I mean!
Recently Deceased French Saint is a great band name
Excuse me what?!?! Will season 5 happen from hell???
Season finale already?! Awh man!
If you are from Texas you love whataburger. It’s amazing
Noooo this was one of my favorite things to watchhhh
What just happened
Why is genie Shane giving me klaus from umbrella academy vibes??? 😂
Not the David S. Pumpkin reference 💀💀
PROFESSOR NOOOOO
“since this isn’t one of those lazy shows that leave things unsolved at the end…” - the professor 31:52
*P O S S E S S  M E, D A D D Y*
pour one out for the professor 🍾😔
It is season finally! Oh noooooooooo!
Someone call Kate
this is exactly the ending i would expect shane to make lol
NOOOOOO not the Professor!!!!
PROFESSOR NOOOOOOO
NOOOO, RYAAAN WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?! You better ask the genie to bring the Professor back!!  (Great season finale, loved it!)
I can't wait for the movie, where Ryan hunts down the genie to save the professor, and probably there's some good songs in there too.
so glad we got to see shane's true form as the last musical performance of the season
Someone could make an entire movie out of this plot and I'd watch the shit out of it. Super hot buff charming Chad priest shows up in town, swoons all the ladies, embarrasses the dork priests in public displays, beats people up in fist fights, and eventually knocks up the local pretty rich girl from a rich family. And in revenge the rich guy and the church work together to get some nuns to fake possession and blackmail him, which gets out of control and people from all over the land come to see them so they just keep it going for a while. Until eventually they name Chad priest as responsible so they can arrest him and have the rich guys relative surgeon stab him in the dick and balls over and over and finally used his screams as proof of posession. Which made all the girls who participated in blackmailing him feel horrible and confess. But no one believed them. So he was tortured and then publicly burned at the stake. THEN after that a bunch of people connected to blackmailing and torturing him start dropping dead under mysterious circumstances. What the fuck. What a movie.
You know what, good for Ryan! He shouldn't let little people pick on him and deny him little trophies...and sing cute little songs and share jelly beans from his cute little pouch......   Dang it, Ryan! Why?
Steven should have dressed as a nun and jump scares Ryan
GIVE ME MORE LORE
Hey what the fuck
I was expecting Ryan to be Possessed this whole season, but gotta say, full on pact with the Devil and the Professor straight up dying was unexpected!! Cant wait to see next season and how this all gets fixed!!!
this can't be the end, can it? but as much as i love the show i don't want them to come back with a substitute teacher, i just want our professor back.  (also is the molasses horse okay?)
What do you mean dead!!!
D :
that was cheating that wasn't the professor's words i will fight the genie!!
What the actual fuck did i just watch oh my god.... Well i cant wait until next season lol
you could say ryan's a lot like joker, from the movie joker
THIS IS HOW I FELT AFTER WATCHING INFINITY WAR.
I’m crying very hard at the moment
Wait so was Ryan working with the devil this whole time??? Or just this episode? And also, this better not be the last we hear from the professor!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I don’t know what to expect for next season since this is a “season finale” and not a “series finale”
if the professor is actually dead I don't know what I'm gonna do
Oh nnnooooo! Ryan you need to challenge the Devil now, you gotta win the Professor back!!
wow.
"Possess me, Daddy!" - Professor
Ladies and gentlemen everybody!  F    R    A    N    C     E
By far the best season finally ever
...
This is the same thing he did to Gene
NOT THE INFINITY WAR REFERENCE
Ryan and Sara need to fight through time and bring the Professor back.
That poor man....yikes....
33:34 Sara really likes the last line from Eyes Wide Shut
Hope you're happy with yourself, Ryan!!! (Personally, I think that the Professor kinda had it coming).
Holy shit 🤣
F
Man! You better bring back that adorable furry blue puppet back, or I'll have no reason to live anymore. Go full supernatural, travel back in time, create another timeline, I dont care! BRING THE PROFESSOR BACK!!!
*falls to knees* Nnnnnnooooooooooooooo!
I'd thought that Ryan would name Shane as one of the demons possessing him XD
“The past, was the worst” S.W.
Sara: what did it cost Ryan? Ryan: everything  does this mean Professor is Ryan's everything? /Ugly sobbing/
So, with the professor being 'canonically dead' does thst mean this is actually the SERIES finale or no?
Some of the obey me brothers were having some fun.
Ryanos (Ryan Thanos)
The Professor is gonna be back, right? He's still fought his way out and gonna get revenge on Ryan........
DID HE JUST GET EATEN??? WATCVWR WHAT THE HELL
good for ryan!!!!
I agree google drive is of the devil
Points:9  Damn the quarantine life got to those ladies  #RyanRedemption2022 PUPPET PLUSHIE!
This is truly my favorite show that you guys do
Damn that Thanos quote from Ryan hits so hard at the end like Jesus
Top 10 anime betrayals.
PROFESSOR! NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
How is Ryan gonna hate on whataburger??? Damn you Austin Texas get it together!!
Im still thinking about the molasses horse in hell subplot. I never thought the genie plot was gonna play out. How fun.
Ryan's face at the end of the song is literally the best reaction to these songs 🤣 i love you guys keep it going! Lmaoo
Man, that was definitely disturbing.😱😁
:(
ryan i will fight you about whataburger. and i will win.
6:02 "making of mockery of the science" sure ryan. "Science."
I love the episode, but Ryan missed the opportunity to say "Shane" when the question was "What Demons are possessing you"
The only thing keeping me from crying is that they said this was just a *season* finally, not a *series* finally.  I'm holding on to that last shred of hope till the professor himself comes and rips it away.
Did Ryan inadvertently kill the professor . How cruel
I'm currently watching this episode sick in bed right now and I think I just tripped balls. Is this the wrap on Puppet History???? Ryan what have you done?!
I am very convinced The Professor's canonically dead forever. What a tragic turn of events.  .....ANY WAYS THE RESCUING THE PROFESSOR ARC GONNA BE LIIIIT
Is this loss
... anyone know a good necromancer? I am DEAD.
Canon you say? Well i refuse
Omg! Shane is a genius, really! Nice one Ryan 😉
Holy hell that ending was bonkers!
Ryan will bring the Professor back through the power of Drunk History
YES!!!! KILL!!!!!
This show slaps so fucking hard
Vet Tech here is approves of the Toxoplasmosis demon lmao
was honestly expecting ryan to just reach onto the stage to start choking the professor himself, so the demon possession was a great twist
Is this what you wanted? Me crying on my kitchen floor like Trisha? Is it?
I am sitting here, mouth wide open. I have been for 5 mins after finishing the video. :O
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
What I think could have been mentioned is that, many times, nuns would restrain themselves when it came to eating 'too much,' sleeping 'too much,' etc. They didn't want God to think they were slothful, gluttinous, etc. So, all of these super natural elements could have easily been heightened through exhaustion, malnutrition, poor mental health, unpleasant stuff like that.
Congrats on the trophy Ryan! Well deserved man! No one was harmed in the winnings and everything is all good in the world! The Professor must be so proud!
holy shit
I wonder if my roommates could hear me screeching in anguish over the fate of a puppet...
I… I am so upset. I need more history and C Dogs and jellybean poops
My mind is blown....I  have no words
my guy!!!!! not the wikifeet watermarks over the professor's pic after he canonically died!!!!!
Shouldn't Asmodeus have a white Colonel Sanders suit and southern accent?
Nooooo, the professor can't really be dead!
A great movie - if you can find it - about this incident is 1971's "The Devils", if anyone wants more possessed nun content.
hey guys, what the hell
RYAN! What have you DONE, man? How.....how COULD you?!
I can excuse selling the Professor out for a trophy but I draw the line at quoting Avengers
I can't believe Ryan said that about Whataburger.
RYAN’S BEEN WORKING FOR THE GENIE THIS WHOLE TIME? PLOT TWIST
"This isn't one of those lazy shows that leaves things Unsolved at the end..."  Dayum! Professor throwing some lighthearted shade 🤣🤣🤣
I feel like the professor is the Dr strange of the situation. Offering up his last jelly bean and accepting his fate like the time Stone and this is Ryan's thanos arc. He got what he wanted but at a great cost. Now we just need the team of performance puppets to go save the professor!
Y’all should get into last podcast on the left! They cover this topic at length and a lot of other things the boys have given us on PH/BFU, with the same stupid humour
Ryan's gonna have all the Texans come after him since he trashed Whataburger
I can't believe the semester's over already! 😭😭😭 Eagerly awaiting my final grade and for enrollment to start again so I can take The Professor's next course.  EDIT: The student hub says The Professor isn't teaching next semester? Did something happen? It just says "Instructor: TBD" now. I hope it's not some rando they force to pick up the class...
PROFESSORRRRRRRRR NOOOOOOOOOOO
wait does this mean puppet history is over? I am confused... If so I will literally cry.
Absolutely losing my shit at “canonically dead fyi” 😭😂
So that was the last one?
Oh heeeeelll no!!! bring him back! Bring him back i tell you! U heartless monsters! I will never forgive you! NEVEEEEEEERRRR!!!! USURP THE WATCHER!!! BRING BACK THE PROFESSOOOR!!!  Fan temper tantrum aside: this series is amazing, one of a kind and incredibly entertaining. I plead with u, oh mighty watcher to keep the series going! U know if u get to it.. And if u like to... But anyways please  get the professor back. ASAP
Receipts?? The convent was full of Karens?
Had to just have a bad Whataburger probably at 1am or some shit. Whataburger is fire… You’re tripping.
First Buzzfeed Unsolved and now this. Plot is thicker than the Avengers
What a finale
F I N A L L Y
i HAVE BEEN STARING AT THIS SCREEN FOR FIVE MINUTES COMPLETELY IN AWE AND DEVASTATION, HOW COULD YOU DO ME LIKE THIS?
I knew better than to trust a nice Ryan to the professor 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I have. So many questions.
When there's holes in the sack, you know you gotta go back
Baguettes better than croissants
"now that's a genie" "that's a demon" "now that's the devil" i love sarah lmfao
Cant wait to find out wat happens net on PHCU, the Puppet History Cinematic Universe... cause Imma need our boy back.
I hope this isn't the last season!
"I've had no experiences with demons because they don't exist"  Shanara are meant for each other.
6:32 I had to pause I was ugly laugh/crying so loudly at this whole bit I couldn't hear anything else--I want a "Itsa Me! Dracula 🇮🇹" T-shirt so badly
Rest in peace, Professor, you'll be remembered always 😢
PROFESSOR NOOOOOOO
Wait what ?
Lol well maybe we should try Satan.
Sara vs. Ryan? Hmmm, I wonder who will win this one.....
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Next season: PUPPET PREHISTORY
So, Ryan’s gonna hunt down the genie to wish the professor back, right? He’s not really gone, right? Right?
Nope. Not cool. Ryan you better find a way to bring the Professor back! HE IS BELOVED!!!
Wow. That was the probably one of the greatest season finales I've ever seen! I'm so worried about the professor. I hope this shows even more potential for the show and not the worst possibility.... Never seeing it again 🙀
My heart will never heal, R.I.P. The Professor 😭😭😭
WHAT
I enjoy everyone’s theories, but how funny would it be if next season started and everything was just exactly the same and it was acknowledged but ignored
Me, wondering if any obey me fans are in the comments thinking what i was thinking during the song: 👁👄👁
Can you do something from Mexico cause I want to see professor try to speak Spanish
the cross fade of ryan and the devil... beautiful. ryan really is a clown for trusting the devil, but that's been beefboy for ya
Nooooo wtf you bastards you killed the professor!!
I'm sorry, the professor is a time traveling puppet that has beef with a genie but he doesn't believe in ghosts? 🤨
I’m sad now
Experienced this while in the gym, expressed shock outloud several times.
Here I was expecting a Beef Boy Rampage, and instead we got cold and quiet vengeance, shocking consequences, and deep regret. WTF guys?!?!? Y’all better dabbling in that deep, dark magic, Ryan, cuz we needs us some more Professor!!
I have so many more emotions than I expected Puppet History to induce. Wonderful.
what can one do in the face of such monumental loss but breathe a weary sigh, for the world is a little quieter now.  rip el profe ✌️ 😔.
this whole thing was sounding really familiar, and then i remembered that they made a movie about it with oliver reed. it was uh, an experience- brows held high has a video about it
the wikifeet watermark lmaooooooooooooooooooo
D:
No no no no no. You cant do this. The professor is amazing. Fix this Begara
It's not a question of if, it's a question of when (or perhaps more importantly, *how* ...)
I got an ad about sea shanty’s for this I am so confused about what YouTube is doing at the moment
BEST LEAD UP I'VE EVER SEEN!
aAAAAAAAAA NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO AAAAAAAAAAAA OH MY GOODNESS NOOOOOOOO
Oh my god the clown facepaint on Ryan
Bummer.
Somebody throw the professor into a Lazarus pit
What a wild ride
None of those demons were big threats until Alex.
please the clown makeup on ryan during the fadeout
Make more Are You Scared
I hope he gets pooped out and comes back. This show is one of my favorites and always look forward for the next one 🙏 please come back.
WHATTTTT PROFESSOR????
BRO WHAT
I have a slight feeling this game was a little rigged
Oh fuck Ryan become Joker
I'm giggling
Wait, in the Olga episode, the molasses horse kept popping in on the Jelly Telly. What if he was trying to warn the Professer about the Devil's plan?!?!?!
Please tell me there will be a season 5. DONT let the professor be dead for real
what the fuck
NOOOOOO
So uhh… are we going to see the professor next semester?
THE WIKI FEET WATERMARK AT THE END 💀💀
Don´t you just love a sweet great show with no lore?
Well..... It's not like no one knew what was coming, but Holy shit....
I- W h a t t h e e v e r l o v i n g f u c k
Um...EXCUSE ME?!?!?!?
I thought Ryan was trying to summon Ricky
34:20 wow that’s quite a masterpiece ASMODEUS 🎶
Y I K E S ! ! ! ! !
damn Rest In Peace to the Professor, forever will be missed 💔
The whataburger SLANDER!
I don't even know how to feel after this finale.
HEY SHANE, RYAN, WTF
If anyone looks closely at 41:01, you'll see that Ryan now had clown makeup on. Very good detail but I'm gonna go cry now
Damn, old France fucking sucked
MERCH JUST WENT WAAAAAY UP IN VALUE
11:48 Love the Pompeii callback
NOOOOO Professor!!! 💔 Ryan you better figure out one way or another to bring that beautiful little fluffy blue professor back to life and back from Jurassic park before next season! Lol I feel like I just lost a dear friend 😭😂 Seriously great job though guys, what a great episode. I'm sad its the finale but also excited for Are you scared? I hope thats coming soon 😊❤
Just realized I think this priest might be the inspiration for Father Louis for James Reeses witch series.  Good to know. Edit:ahhhbbhbb The Professor
WHAT THE ACTUAL  FUCK
What do you mean CANONICALLY DEAD?! O_O
THE WAY I JUST SCREAMED AT WORK!!!! 😱
the genie storyline of puppet history is the hot daga on steroids
*Loudon.... The cardinal....walled city....*  Why does this sound familiar?  *Remembers Brows Held High*  .....HOLY SHIT I KNOW THIS STORY!!!!
YOOOOO!!!! WTH... he can't be gone. He's coming back... I know he is.. 🥺
Just finished this and HO-LY SHIT. We got a fucking good history tale We got a spicy end (to what I'm gonna call the time wish arc) and a chance for a new beginning of something awesome (maybe more biological history drama? Like the bone wars?) A fucking banger of a song (shane and co. how do you do it?)  Just, all around? Phenomenal production quality, with the puppets and the effects and the set The game is fun and never boring The selected history hijinks aren't always the common ones (and when they are it's still fuckin awesome) I loved this season and I love Puppet History!!! Thank you everyone at Watcher for this. Godspeed on what you're working on next, beit another season or something completely different. -miki
PROFESSOR NOOOOOOOOO
Don't mind me just gonna head out with the bois to go genie hunting, I'll catch you guys later.
Ive screamed..... ive cried... ive giggled.... WTF PUPPET HISTORY. RYAN YOU BETTER FIX THIS.
Wow, there was no need to hit me in the feels like that, guys. I'm disappointed in Ryan, sad about the Professor and... turned on by the Genie? It's a goshdarned rollercoaster of emotions.
This series better become available to DVD..... This is the most learning of history that stuck too me ever XC my heart bleeds
I love Ryan’s t shirt so much!
Nooo! It’s already the season finale! 😭😭😭
shane is the devil confirmed. bring back the professor right now
Whataburger is pretty awful Ryan
Noooo. Ryan, what did you do?
✨Hell yeah ✨
i got a nose bleed while watching this. it's the demons
Kevin or something idk 🤷
so the professor really IS history
WHAT THE FUUUUUCK
Please say sike
It’s weird that asmodeus was a demon in real life, then he was a demon in DnD and if I’m not mistaken he’s dead in canonical dnd
Loudun is in France... I just thought they had fucked up at spelling London
i want the B Boys back
setting aside the absolutely heart wrenching ending, that song was a banger and is probably my favorite out of all the puppet history songs
if there’s not a next season i will riot.
THE CLOWN MAKEUP THAT FADED INTO VIEW OVER RYANS FACE AT THE END GOT ME
RYAN YOU SOLD OUT THE PROFESSOR FOR A TROPHY?!
WIKIFEET????
I saw a movie about this called The Devils ( 1971) it was a controversial film bc obviously it was overly sexualizing nuns.
Excuse me CANONNICALY WHAT NOW?
RIP Puppet History it was fun while it lasted 😂
It was Ryan all along🎶
RYAN WHAT HAVE YOU DONEEEE
Wow way to kill all of our souls, as if the last 1.5 years hasn't been hard enough. 😭😭😭
So is this the end? The end of history the THE Professor? How can I keep going doing history without him? That's pretty bad. I'm sad now.
I'm sorry his RIP picture is from wikifeet HELP
Well... That took a dark turn there at the end
what a season!!
Y'all I need some classic 50k angst, hurt/comfort, reunion fanfics where Ryan, fueled by guilt, travels throughout time looking for his rival and eventually saves him with the help of all the characters we've met along the way 😭 Edit: just realized all the characters are also dead since the spell was undone 🥲 perhaps all the previous winners then
Please keep the series alive
Thank you very very much for the potential epilepsy/seizure warning 👌🏻 Way to few content creators take epileptic and photosensitive people into account with all their wacky animations and flashes of light 💕
Well it did cost everything, but more important question is, was it worth it? The answer is surely: yes!
Hello demons…It’s me…ya boy.
This was dark.
Devil: LUL Ryan: 🤡
Hmmm maybe we'll have a sub in the meantime?
Sarah and Shane are still together- Good to know.
We knew ryan was up to no good!!! We Warned you!!! Professor nooooo
OH MY GOD?????? THAT'S HOW IT ENDS??
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WHAT
WHAT
Soooo……… this was a SEASON finale right??? Not a SERIES finale???
I think it would be great if you guys made more of these. There are only like 5 episodes a season but these videos are by far the most popular
I love this. This is a buzzfeed unsolved episode in a different font
I had no idea there was lore behind the lore. Wow. I'm so invested now.
NO SHANE HOW COULD YOU
there better be another season of this i stg
I love Shane. If I ever have a son or daughter, Shane will be their name.
"This isn't one of those shows that leaves things unsolved at the end."  😏
I mean the puppet would still be able to mess with demon kind, like say asmodeus, since ya know, void was before Dinosaurs
Hopefully, this inst entirely ending the show but rather opening it up to a more scientific plot, like the dinosaurs... I'm just grabbing at ideas to fuel my delusion that the professor is still alive :(((
Unpopular opinion here...but I'm kinda glad Ryan finally won one lol
urbain grandier: exists nuns: Imma ruin this man's whole life
I love that the professors’ final photo is a shot from wikifeet
Jeff Goldblum returns to Jurassic Park. Stumbling upon a mound of jelly beans, he proclaims, "That is a big pile of T-Rex shit!"
Was that a thanos reference at the end lol. ALSO IM FUCKING CRYING THERE BETTER BE ANOTHER SEASON OR ELSE QJDJALSKA (also this takes me back to jean and The Hot daga saga. Rip Jean rip professor)
No! No! No!
WHAT THE FUCK
I love yall .pause. Keep up the great a work
😳 🪦 RIP canonically professor
“So what does having that trophy feel like, Ryan?”  Ryan Probably: “Regret.”
wikifeet professor :/
Quick dislike the videos as a riot
Loved the croissants, not a big fan of the leg-crushing… 3 1/2 stars
Laughed so hard I almost passed out— might sue tbh
Oh, Ryan looking salty
My boy is dead and you drop his wikifeet in the eulogy? For shame
Shane: Cardinal Richloo Me, a French Canadian: *enters a trance*
YES, JUST YES, THE GENIE LORE IS BACK , I LOVE IT
Oh no!!!!!  Wonderful job, Watcher!  This was beautifully done!
WHATTATA NOOOO
I need a gif set of Sarah tapping her hip saying “I’m tasty!”
Will the devil host the next season and Ryan and the guests have to answer enough questions correctly in order to win back the professors soul?! Will there be another season?! I am not strong enough for this to be the final season!!!
RIP, rest in puppet...
This is gonna be interesting, especially with Ryan's hatred of demons. I wonder if the professor will conjure a demon just to mess with him lol.
Banger of a song but screw Asmodius fr Either way, incredible ending guys. Great way to wrap things up! Gonna miss that fuzzy blue guy though
Next season,  Ryan travels to save the Prof and teaches us about dinosaurs 🦕
Why these seasons got to be so short?
Sarah has Winona Ryder vibes. More Sarah please ✌🏻
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
was that shade to buzzfeed not to shabbby
BEST👏🏼 CLIFFHANGER👏🏼 EVER👏🏼
Noooooooo!!!!!!!!!
Noooo professor
Canonically huh 🥲
it woulda been funny if professor like, didn't die and instead somehow everyone ended up being fuzzy puppets
WHAT. THE. FUCK.
Professor was strangely kind this video ….suspicious. Is he possessed?🤨
TTHE SUPERIMPOSED JOKERFACE ON RYANHVJ
Does is mean no more puppet history??
Tell me do you know about the plot to kill me? If so do you know who? Please reply... ThankYou
I- did that- Actually you know what? No, I’m not questioning anything ever again <3
This can’t be over, I just found it this season!
Heeeeee's fine!
I refuse to acknowledge this death and would now like to see Puppet Prehistory. Teach me something about dinosaurs and Neandertaler!
CANONICALLY DEAD?????`Θ`
Holy... Ryan, how could you? You better fix this man.
PROFESSOR?????
Well... That was unexpec... No it was expected XD
I’m not here for the whataburger slander
Wait but….. puppet history will continue….. right?????
😲😳😱      ...... Professor will poop a jelly and Ryan better watch out when he gets back!!!
That damnedable genie!
How come no B Boys this episode
Nooooooo!
I wanted Ryan to win but... not like this... not like this, man......
You mean to tell me there was a person called "Large City"? That's way more interesting than the 5th season of Demons are Us!
WHAT NO IT CAN'T BE RIGHT1!!!!! PROFESSOR !!!!!😢
The professor canonically dying by dinosaur is my villain origin story
Rip
NO FREE THE PROFESSOR
There's an absolutely brilliant movie based on this incident, it's called The Devils (1971) and it's still one of the most controversial movies ever made.
NOOOOOOO! NOT THE PROFESSOR! 😭
So Ryan finally got his trophy.....but at what cost?
I think on Halloween, Puppet History is gong to go over the story of Vlad the impaler since it would suit the theme of Halloween really well.
Please, Watcher Team. PLEASE have Shane, Ryan and Steven play Phasmaphobia for Halloween!!! 😭
WHAT
Well that was equal parts awesome and upsetting, Happy Halloween everyone and know to live in depression until we get confirmation of season 5.
“Hmm… hmmm… Okay. 🤔”
Ryan why? What have you done??
So I'm noticing a pattern here: every time Sarah is a guest, the topic is "France getting terrorized by the supernatural"
Well deserved, Ryan!
I feel like these nuns were just Karens of the 1600's encountering the black plague and over dramatisizing it
F's in the chat boys the professor is dead *crying*
The molasses horse tried to warn him…
1632 is also my favorite Ring of Fire book. It’s about a 2000’s American town getting sent back in time to the titular year. They also have several short stories set throughout the world and I really hope one of them is set during this incident.
hands down, this ending is the best thing put on youtube in the last decade. i am CRYING with laughter XD
Yo the final song absolutely fucks and I am ignoring the last three minutes of the episode
Well this was incredibly insensitive, offensive, and disrespectful.
Rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble! What the fork did you did you do to the professor?!
the creativity in this blows my mind I love it so much. Made my day 🥺 thank you Ryan and Shane
Just learned about the Cathars of France and their persecution could be an interesting episode!
PROFESSOR NO
RYAN WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
YEEEESSS LOOOORE!!!
That’s a September to remember
Amazing as always. Ended on such a sad note. Wonder how Ryan will coop with his guilt...
i fuckin lost it at "dougie to death" XD
Got the whattaburger by the airport in Austin. Worst experience of life hands down
f in the chat for the professor gone but not forgotten 😞 rip
What - and I cannot stress this enough - the fuck, Watcher?? How could you do this 😭
nobody:  the professor: POSSESS ME DADDY
SPOILERS:          Yeah right, Watcher, no way the Professor is actually dead! I refuse to believe that! Ryan looked so guilty at the end. There's no way Ryan will let him stay gone, canonically dead my ass! If Ryan doesn't save the Professor, I'll throw hands.  Also, where's the Puppet History album??? I need these songs on my Spotify!
Memorial service for the professor at my house. Bring tissues.
*Michael from the office* DEar God no NO nOOOOOooOOooo nooooo
Hoping for a professor next season that has lived thousands of years and survived every time period plotting his revenge. Maybe with an eye patch and a hook hand. Puppets are immortal right??
PLEASE TELL ME SEASON FIVE IS RYAN AND GUEST DRESSED IN DIFFERENT PERIOD FASHION AND LARPING AT PEASANTS LEARNING ABOUT THE PAST/FUTURE
Wait, so is this the series finale? Cause I will cry if it is
those nuns weren't possessed. they just invented the first tik tok dance
I love the professor and I do hope he comes back (can a puppet even die?) but  I personally hope the next season  is hosted by like his daughter or sister or something tearfully caring on The Professor's life work
That's not the English flag.
Never. Dare. Get rid of the C dog bit. Never. Ever. Yes it really is the best bit.
My moon and stars.....awww I love it 💗 a lot
OH MY GOD OH MY GOD WHAT
I’m shook.
bruh they straight up killed the puppet
WOW......... GREATEST...... SEASON..... FINALE..... EVER!! But I am VERY SAD about the professor being dead! 😭
Ahhhhhhhhh I can't believe this
Professor:,(
So...can I get the RIP  the Professor shirt in the merch store? Or one of Ryan with horns and glowing demonic eyes?
you think I'll let this stand??? you think I'll let the professor go????? that genie is on thin fucking ice and when I get my nasty little fingers on him there WILL be carnage
I am at a loss for words, Shane Madej. Oh my god
I'm about to cry is the professor really dead omg
"R.I.P. to a real one"
WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY LITTLE MAN :(
RYAN WTF
Well at least Ryan won once I guess....
Was it worth it Ryan….?  WAS IT WORTH YOU YOU SON OF A-
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!! PROFESSOR!!!!😱
aw damn it this made me emotional. damn it
Absolutely unhinged I love it
officially requesting another full episode of deleted scenes from the season !!! need that content after today's loss </3
OMg NOOOO tHE PROFESSOR,,,,,, RYAN WHAT THE (ELL HAVE YOU DONE!!!!
not the Twisted Sisters headline at 9:42 LMAAAO
BUT IS THE PROPELLER OKAY??
PLEASE, don't say this means that we won't have Puppet History anymore! I can't live like this
Wow, this was. Realy. Good.  Amazing work guys!
*me after seeing this ep is over 40 minutes long*  "Lemme get my hot pocket, imma be here awhile"
PROFESSOR NOOOOOOOO!!!
Resurrect for a season five or all YouTube hope is lost to me.
the professor fucking died
I’m just imagining a bunch of nuns being fed ergot for the people’s entertainment to distract from the plague.
where is my "possess me daddy" merch
38:00 to 40:00 contains the flashing fyi! either slow it down or skip it,its some very intense strobing!
What the fuck😭😭
NOT THE PROFESSOR!!!!!!!!!!! IM CRYING OVER A PUPPET AND I BLAME YOU RYAN!
Ok no y'all don't understand that puppet was the only thing keeping me together please give him back
Not the shadows looking like they are Voguing for their lives!!!!!
The wikifeet watermark really sells it.
Ryan is wearing dad shoes
yes France does have good bread, also translated as good p a i n
OH MY GOD I'VE BEEN WORRIED SICK WHERE HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN IT'S SUNDAY FOR GOSH SAKES!!!!!! Seriously, though, missed you guys on Friday! Ryan didn't mention Ricky Goldsworth as one of the demons possessing his body because that one's real (also not a demon, just a really dark personality - but close) :P ...Of course Ryan Bergara would slip in an MCU reference ("What did it cost?" "Everything...")
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱   REALLY?????💔💔💔💔💔🥺🥺🥺🥺😭😭😭😭😭😭
D8 Professor!?
Ryan saying he hates Whataburger was really the saddest part of the finale.
Why am I crying over a blue puppet?
Ryan getting his last jelly bean AND getting to slowly kill the professor is peak multitasking
The molasses horse tried to warn us... ...but we didn't listen  R.I.P to a real one :'(
Alright, time travel arc next season to save the professor?
I noticed that Stolas didn't show up- guess he was too busy thirsting after Blitzo yet again...
Reading the comments before watching the video was a mistake
Really thought Ryan would have written down Ricky Goldsworth next to all the demons inside of him
wikifeet? Wikifeet?? WIKIFEET?!?
Please don't tell me this is the end. If it is, okay, but I just want to see the devil in a professor outfit at least once.
We love the jab to buzzfeed unsolved at 31:54
1:11 oh Shane is laughing knowing that she already meet a demon lord aka Shane himself
huh
Maybe he’ll run into a couple of hotdogs and a blue painted peach to help him set this whole thing right
To this episode I can only say.... WHAT?!
The one and only demon posessing Ryan is Ricky Goldsworth.
This being my first episode makes it really really confusing
Me: “wait…this sounds familiar.”  -checks watch history-  Me: “YUP I KNEW IT!”  There’s actually a movie called “The Devils” based off of this historical event! IT IS VERY GOOD I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
NOOOO!- I refuse to accept that the professor is dead! I will personally hunt down that Genie if I have to, and make him bring back our fuzzy, blue, what-ever-species-he-is! WHOS WITH ME?!
The only thing in my head rn is “Bro what the fuck?”
I’m gonna be pissed if that’s a wrap on this series
jokes on you. i have watched enough supernatural to know that dead-by-devil-deal things don't stay dead long. i realize this is more of a self-own than anything
About to get so downvoted, but he had it coming.
NOOOOOOOOO
NOOOOO
Is this the end of puppet history
He’s history. Me, August: Yeah he is 😎  He’s history. Me, October: Yeah he is 😭
PROFESSOR NOOOOO
The people who were commenting before about the genie stuff being annoying... HAPPY NOW?!
DUUUUUUUUUUUUDE JESUS CHRIST that was absolutely amazing and I am absolutely dying, I knew there had to be ultier motive for Ryan (I'm pretty sure everyone did) but like this was SOOOOO GOOD. I'm reaaallly hoping this doesn't spell the end for the professor, like if need be, I'll sell my soul to get him back if the devil's willing to take it.
With the demon names, I think it was mass hysteria. They *DEFINITELY* did this for attention.
You guys are awesome 😂❣️😂❣️😂
one of the biggest lessons i've learned watching puppet history is that France has always been a terrible place to live
WHAT THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED
WAIT A HOT BLUE JELLYBEAN SHITTIN MINUTE.  Is this it? Is this a series finally? Are we just gunna be left like this?
watching this high was quite entertaining
NO OH MY GOD
How DARE Ryan insult Whata. That is our state gathering place. The first thing we eat after coming home from our property in West Texas. A wedding venue or caterer for some.
…I’m sure he’s fine.
Good for the beef boy!! ..good for him
Well... What can I say. We knew this was coming one way or the other. Ryan was being too friendly, so he was obviously being evil... All of that said...  Why am I crying over a puppet?
Da Fuq? Wait... that's it? The genie wins? The professor gets chomped?  Fix it. Ryan, fix it.  F I X   I T ,   R Y A N.  All in all, great season 4.
This was definitely a journey…
I thought the musical guest would be the dead horse from the season 3 finale. What’s going to happen to him now?
yall cant just end everything i look forward to at the same time like this
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Even with all of the foreshadowing they still managed to make it a thrilling story! I'm loving Ryan's character arc this season!
wait WHAT?? D:
also, have you been planning this arc alllll the way back to "we'll get you to Horse Heaven, or I guess Horse Hell if you were, like, a horse bigot" at the end of season 3?? bc that's some BAD-ASS preplanning if so!
WIKIFEET
Interestingly the professor has been saying that he's not going to attend to the party and conversing with the devil saying that he's from a later episode so he knew Ryan would turn on him
prediction: it looks like the other puppets from the jelly telly party got sucked into hell (where we know the Molasses Horse already was per a previous ep), so I'm thinking they meet up with the Professor there and do a full Endgame "saved from an afterlife dimension" move, maybe with the help of a repentant Ryan. The boys love a Marvel reference.
Not the professor!!!
#ryanbergaraisoverparty
0:38 Professor x Sarah Rubin ❤️❤️❤️❤️🤣
My... my mouth hasn't closed since I was fucking AMBUSHED by that PLOT TWIST.... AHHHHHHHHHH
this finale was so amazing💀💀💀i’m actually dying over this
...professor...?
Made the mistake of watching this at work. 🥺
is this, it the end
Demon in me: "My name's jeff"
I would love to see a behind the scenes of the professor picking the topics he wants to,teach each season.
SARA RUBIN!!! MISS SEEING YOU ON YOUTUBE!
Holy carp. I posted a half-joking comment to their Facebook account about how they should do a session on the Possessions of Loudon a few weeks ago after I found out one of my lady ancestors emigrated to Canada from Loudon around the time this was happening. I did *not* expect that to actually happen. I know the filming schedule means they probably had this in the works before I sent that message, but dang. o_O
Ryan, dude, Whataburger is the best.
TEARS, WATCHER, TEARS
This is what happens when you refuse the lore, Professor.
“I find it’s a lot more fun to be kind” “I don’t think that’s true” 😂😂😂
Shaktaar of the 4th inner circle
PROFESSOR NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO😭😭😭😭
The Professor is dead. Long live The Professor.
WOW  and WTF, Lol. Loved it , Professor when will you be rescued and back on for a new season. There will be another season , I Hope
Id never thought this day would happen, good job ryan, yall got me sitting on tbe edge of my seat in pure shock
I mean Ryan finally got the trophy so who cares 😀
What is the budget of this show?
Ain't no way
This is a series about singing puppets and history, why am I emotional??
Wow. I was here for Ryan's redemption all season, only for him to SLANDER Whataburger like this. That MONSTER.
im crying over a puppet
31:51 "Now since this isn't one of those lazy shows that leaves things unsolved at the end..."  I can't possibly imagine what the Professor could be referring to.
41 minutes of puppet filled fun!!!!
so uh, don’t fuck with the devil ig
I thought the title was making fun of British accents... turns out that France exists
You even have merch of it?
Oh god......it happend 😢😢😢 he will be missed
yes…YES
Spoiler     Professor: Where am I?! Me: More like when are you my guy.
I reject your reality and substitute my own
:(
I'll fight that damn dinosaur for the Professor, give him back you monsters!! Ryan I'll never forgive you. D:  (In all seriousness is that the end of the show? :(  I'm uh kind of legitimately crushed if that's the case.)
YEAHHH BAYBEEE THAT'S WHAT I'M BEEN WAITING FOR, THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT WOOOOOOOHHH
Nope. Nope. NOPE. not happening. Unacceptable. NOPE.
NOOOOO!!
OK, Imma guess that The Professor is made from a preexisting (therefore copywrited) puppet, and he is gonna be replaced with a Nephew or something so that we can finally get soft toys. Right? RIGHT? COS THAT IS THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE REASON! x
GIVE ME MY BLUE CREATURE BACK 😭😭😭😭
Did The Professor just...die?       You know it's really unclear
"now since this isn't one of those lazy shows that leaves things unsolved at the end"   👁️👄👁️
I am shook
The demon possessing me is a little something called “Student Loans”
FINALE?
Ryan not writing Ricky Goldsworth in the demon question is the greatest disappointment I’ve ever known
At 1:15 Ryan was reliving his flashbacks
I am happy for Ryan. He deserved a trophy
Time to break out the pickling brine.
31:52 OK PROFESSOR CALM DOWN
Excuse me but fluff this ending 😨 x
Why would you do that Ryan?
WTF RYAN
ryan you done fuckee up
As an epileptic, wanted to say thanks Watcher team for adding the little disclaimer at the beginning! People rarely do stuff like that.
So does that mean we are not having any more puppet history since now the Professor is canonically dead?
PROFESSORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
HOLY FUCK?
That ending!! 😱😭
This was amazing.
When is watcher gonna release an album of all of the songs!
Ryan "we live in a society" Bergara
the fucking wikifeet watermark made me lose it
does this mean there’s no next season 😭
ASMODEUS: Omae wa mou shindeiru! THE PROFESSOR: Nani?!
Absolutely speechless. You guys are the best. I hope the professors going to get pooped out by the dinosaur.
ayo shoutout ursulines i go to y’all’s school
Nooooo! You can’t do that you’re not allowed! 😭
Best bit on the show
No wonder the upload got delayed! Ryan didn’t want us to know what he did!
F
aw man i was hoping to see an episode about emperor norton
That priest Surin really went and said, "hey demons! It's me! Ya boi!"
Don’t worry the professor will use their intellect to come back and kickass, undead or by other means
Don’t think it’s good for a lifespan of a company to kill off their most successful IP but hey, you do you
Does anyone else make the sea dog noise when they do? 😂😂
finally... ryan's joker-fication arc is complete
Did they forgo an educational sponsor for this episode so we could end the season with genie lore?! 😲
The song sounded like something Ghost would write
Surprised Ricky goldsworth didn’t make the list
Okay I’ve had a bad 24hrs and I really didn’t need this too. Just fully break my heart with is. Thanks Ryan
I loved Sarah's little asides and her judgement of Ryan those were great
I knew it it's a trap is Ryan gonna be the next professor
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT I NEED SEASON 5 NOW 😭
;___________;
Fun fact: Behemoth is actually pronounced in Hebrew as Behema, and just means Cow.  Leviathan is pronounced Live-Ya-Tan. It means whale.  So one of the nuns just admitted she was possessed by a cow and a whale
YOU CANNOT LEAVE ME HANGING LIKE THAT
Man, all I ever wanted was a happy little win for Ryan. Not this.
I have a theory that Ryan is gonna become the new professor because he ate all those jelly beans and to atone for what he did.
Ok i just finished and uh... WHAT DID I JUST WATCH??????
NOT THE WIKI FEET WATER MARKS OVER HIS MEMORIAL PICTURE
The wikifeet watermark oooh my godddd
41:00  Ha Joker Ryan
Oh noooo professor!!!!!!!!
Yeees I was hoping for the loreeeeee
...whoa dude...
i can’t believe, as a texan, that ryan disrespected whataburger like that. that man probably enjoys the cold fries from in and out
D:
SPOLIER:   I DEMAND A MOVIE LENGTH VIDEO WHERE RYAN HAS TO GO BACK IN TIME TO PUNCH A DINO AND SAVE THE PROFESSOR
Well that happened ……..  So is Rayan going to save the professors or like what ?
HOW DARE YOU
HOLY SHIT IM--------------------      THIS CANDSOFJDSKFJS DTHE PLOTTWISTS???? OMG THE ENDING NO (the joker ref ;) ) BUT LIKE AJKLFJDLKJFD EHEHLP NO JDKAFSJKFLJ D AMZAING WRITING AND BRINGING EVERYTHING TOGETHER FROM THE GENIE LORE AND THE DEVIL??? THE HECKING RYING ACTING IT ALL OUT ACTUALLY EXCUSE ME CANONICALLY DEAD??????????
OH HELL NAW!
Genie i wish the professor never went through a time portal and will be back for another season. i wished it, so it has to come true!
I will patiently be waiting for Ryan’s redemption arc.
i love prestige cinema.
If the professor dies in the cretaceous period, does that mean he’s been dead since he was born? Food for thought.
If the next season isn’t Ryan trying to figure out how to get the professor back by going through different time periods or using some of the funny “teachings” to find him and bring him back… I’m going to be so sad😂😂
My two sisters and I: NO! THE PROFESSOR!! Our mom: Y'all are 3 grown women and that's a puppet...... I'm happy for Ryan. My nephew: SILENCE DEMON! Mom: I raised ya'll right.
Omg what a superb season finale!!!
Rip the professor
Oh no !!!!
Can you guys please put a spoiler warning in your comment 🙃 Before, you know, spoiling the episode
So, the Raven was warning all this time, that Ryan was taking the Professor's jellybeans, sapping his strength enough for Asmodeus to possess him and remove the Genie's wishes. What a finale.
D8
Did Ryan just shit on whataburger?
Can we all petition for albums of Puppet history songs to be on Spotify somewhere?  These songs have been SICK
Me at the beginning: yay professor :) Me now: the fuck
That’s enough to make Shane Medaj to believe in demons
I have no words for how distressing this ending was
Wait, WHAT?
listen i wasn’t emotionally prepared for this today, y’all.
So I made a comment before watching… and damit I need more!!!   I love this show and I love where it’s going and the betrayal and the genie 🧞‍♂️   It’s hilarious and goofy and I love puppets!!
NO PROFESSOR
In a episode with demons, possesion, genital torture and the devil himself, Ryans smile of sadistic joy is still the most disturbing thing in this video
... but Professor... the fuzzy details... so beloved...
The fyi is making me laugh through the horror and confusion. But serious note. No other host is gonna be able to handle Ryan. Someone will resurrect the prof. Just so they can quit
This season finale.. Damn
Rip.
I WAS NOT EXPECTING THATS ENDING MY JAW WAS WIDE OPEN  it was so fun watching this episode
WHAT THE HECK IS HAPPENING?????????
if anyone needs me, I'll be crying in the corner dressed in victorian mourning garb.
Wait is this the end of Puppet History??? Just because the professor's canonically dead doesn't mean he can't be canonically revived, right?
this is the beginning of my villain arc you killed the fucking professor
will professor return ?
If there is one thing I've learned from "Star Wars" is that nobody is really gone.
Wait.... what just happened?
So is that the end of puppet history for good? RYAN WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!?!?!?
Спасибо!
Yes he's dead
that song was killer!!
PROFESSOR NOOOOOOO
13:00-13:55, how does no one mention Shane, here?
I was thinking while listening to the intro, wow why does this sound familiar? The music is also used for the Crime Countdown podcast lol
DANG!!!
THE LORE THE LOREEE
i looked at the comments before reaching the end and now i hate myself (:
0.0  i'm speechless... still haven't fully returned yet to reality...
I need some time to process this. What did you do Ryan? What did you do?
Sometimes when im upset i listen to you guys and it brings me joy
*SPOILER*  Of all the ways I expected this season to end, none of them included “the Professor fucking dies by getting eaten by a T Rex”
History will repeat itself eventually.
Professor, wait! There are more pirate queens who need to be featured on this show! You can't go yet!
Professor!!!!!!!!! 😭 🦖
this isn’t the final episode is it?😱
40 minutes, what’s next, an hour?
No song from the devil :(   That being said the one we got was really good I will be listening to it on repeat the on SoundCloud for the next week
But…but…professor? Where you at my dude?
YEAH, SURE, THIS IS FINE. I'M FINE.
How dare u whataburger is delicious
The next season could very well have a plot now, huh.
thanks for giving me something to look forward to these past weeks!!
does this mean puppet history is like over,,? orrr do we get a new prof bc either way im sad
Ah and NOTHING of  value was lost...
WHAt
I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE puppet history!!!! One of the best shows on YouTube and I was a little bummed when there was no post on Friday, but happy they finally released the episode!  I am hoping that somehow the professor can be saved because he's an exceptional host and the show wouldn't be right without him. And I don't know how long we'll have to wait for the next season of puppet history (which I'm hoping they're making a season 5 I guess) because all of these stories are pieces of history that I can swear none of us had ever heard about before!  So make sure Watcher to bring back puppet history because it's an amazing show!! I love it to pieces!!
Et tu, Ryan?
This was all fun and games until ryan asked for a jelly bean
No look look professional !!!!!
WHERES MY SWEET BOY
Sara saying she has no encounters with demons while completely forgetting she's dating Shane, a demon himself
THE FUCKIN JOKER PAINT ON RYAN LMAO-
ryan season five redemption arc where he saves the professor when
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!! Professor!!!!!!
RIP PROFESSOR
Can’t wait for season 5 y’all 🥲
Ok but like.... I want that merch tho
Oh my gosh the head flapping noise got me lol
rip to a real one 😔✊🏽
IS NO ONE GONNA MENTION HOW THE PICTURE WAS FROM WIKIFEET
RYAN HOW COULD YOU
PROFESSOR NO
DreamSMP wishes they had a lore as deep as this
"Just use hammers!!" - Sara Rubin, 2021
Nooo, Professor!! How could you guys do this to us?!
Possess me Daddy
bro what
Wait… wait… what!?
Nooo not the professor, how could ryan do that!!
ok thats it, best musical guest yet
RYAN HOW COULD YOU
a masterpiece of storytelling
Does this mean no more puppet history???
Congratulations to the watcher team on another amazing season and season finale.
Nooooooo! I mean, hilarious. One of the best episodes yet. But.... Nooooo!
This better not be a SERIES finale. I'll have nothing left to live for if Puppet History doesn't come back
Oh my god. This was fantastic! I also love that you exploited it to sell merch. Good way to honor the professor?
I also think the reason why they sort of ended it here is because they have to do the final season of buzzfeed unsolved supernatural with Shane and Ryan I hope once they are done with that they will continue this series
No cause what the actual hell just happened…. I was rooting for you Ryan we all were😢 I will never forgive this 💀
shanes girlfriend canonically saying she'd chill w demons......im just saying.
so this is wear my patreon money is going
Sarah saying she'd chill with demons is just confirmation that Shane is in fact a demon
I need an episode of the Professor in the dinosaur times this would be badass
YOU CANT DO THIS TO ME, I'VE LEARNED MORE THANKS TO THE PROFESSOR THAN IN COLLEGE YOU ARE MAKING ME NOT ABLE TO STUDY, IS THAT WHAT YOU WANTED?   brb I'm gonna go cry in the bathroom for a bit
Biggest twist of my life
That was far from the ending I was expecting….  RIP Professor, you will be missed dearly
The Professor's a cloth puppet, right? I bet he'll give the T-Rex a bad tummy ache & it'll spit him out so violently that he'll reappear back in present time. Or not.
IM SO SAD
first today's boruto episode, now this? what more can i lose 😭
OH FUCK DON’T READ THE COMMENTS BEFORE THE EPISODE IS OVER!!
THE ENDING TWIST OMG
ummmmmm ... he'll be back ....  right ?! RIGHT?!
PROFESSOR NOOOOO D:
Not the main point but why is the professor's RIP photo from wikifeet
Sooooooo does this mean we’re gonna get a new season about how the professor gets out of the Dinosaurs and battles through time and space to battle against the genie while at the same time the guests ruthlessly compete for the title of history master with the other puppets standing in for the professor until he gets home with the power of history points
What I’ve learned from puppet history is that France is a crazy place!! Seriously, how many of these stories have taken place in France??
I'm in SHOCK
if this isnt like a loki type of thing im gonna throw hands
My theory is the beginning of season 5 Ryan missing the Professor and regretting what he has done sits alone and rubs his I'll gotten trophy. Unbeknownst to him that trophy the devil tossed him was really the Genie's vessel. Now with the genie obligated to grant him 3 wishes 1. First wish for you the viewer to like and subscribe the video and the Watcher channel. 2. Second wish for you the viewer to purchase some merch from the watcher store and/or join the watcher patreon. 3. Third wish is for the Genie to resurrect the Professor and bring him back to his rightful time.
this was soo good!
Ohhhhhh noooooooooo! RYAN THANKS FOR CRYIN! :(((((((((( Rofl. <3
Say sike rn
for those who havent watched the video like me dont read the comments just yet! :")
Ryan ... I believe in ghost
Imagine if you had just stumbled upon this channel and had to listen to Ryan casually talk about how he has repressed experiences with demons
i like to think that they were faking it before grandier got executed, and then grandier was like "aight, SCREW yall" and decided to curse them for real from the grave
Yo what the Asmodeus just happened?! One minute I'm jamming along to a demon concert, next everything's gone off the rails 😂
AT WHAT COST RYAN?! AT. WHAT. COST
RIP Professor 💔 😭
😯😦☹
ok. well. season 5 has to be ryan making a deal with the genie and going to the cretaceous to save the professor. sara will be the scientist with the best outfits. right? right, guys?
WHAT NO
PROFESSOR NO
😵
:(
PROFESSOR, NOOOOOOOOOO!!
was fun while it lasted.  bummer it is over now.  unsubscribing, see ya later
no it can't be the end of the professor  😭😭
I suppose we should count our lucky stars they didn't decide to have the demon "Dog Dick" sing the song at the end.
Man genie looking like Shane is gonna be the biggest plot twist of this show
google drive is an anagram for eviler doggo
Ryan:my demon is whataburger Everyone from Texas:better get used to those demons
Yall know Asmodeus is the demon of lust, right? To me it feels like the nuns were sneakily saying "god im so fuckin sexually frustrated" XD
Boycotting history forever if this is actually the end
ok so i was watching this and screamed "WHAT THE F-" at the end and my mom thought i was dying, but seriously say some rn because IF THE SHOW IS OVER IM GONNA RIOT
Soooo.. anyone got the number of a decent Puppetmancer?
😱
I came here to laugh at history and now my fiancé is wondering why I am crying over a blue puppet
I think the Asmodeus song was one of my favorites in this series
you're trying to distract us from the professor's death with cute little toys but i see through you, shane alexander madej.
Great season finale you guys!! Can't wait to see the NEXT ONE.. 'cause.. There's going to be... a next one.. Right?
😨OMG!!!! The poor Professor! Come back Professor! What do you mean 'RIP'?! No way the t-rex is gonna poop the Professor out and he's gonna make his way back somehow after surviving by turning dinosaurs from eating meat to jellybeans. Love the reference to the Mt Vesuvius episode at 11:50 lol. Amazing episodes even though it makes me a little sad at the end. Well I'm off to Saudi Arabia to hunt for genie lamps to wish for the Professor's safe return. See you soon and wish me luck. Don't tell Ryan. My answers: 1.a foreclosed?    2.Procrastios & Elefawail are my demons    3.c priest knocked up girl?    4.b contract?    5.c got worse?    6.mistress?
The production value is just ✨exquisite✨
31:52 the shade!
The pin test was so inconsistent. Some say scream=witch, some say lack of scream (like when they were tortured for so long the body just stops)= also witch
This better not be the end of puppet history and the professor, if he doesn't cut his way out of that T Rex and come back for revenge I'm unsubbing
I'M SORRY WHAT!!!!!! PROFESSOR'S DEAD     So that's why Ryan's been so nice        We need matpat to make a theory on puppet history
The Blue Man Group is the official group of this show.
Please make an..."oh shit" tshirt....definitely a common phase in all of ryan and Shane's shows
Two theories for next season (pls): 1) Ryan saves the professor in the greatest redemption arc in anime history and 2) God himself saves him. Either way he can't be gone forever, right?  About the story, while there was definitely a massive conspiracy against this priest, this was clearly an episode of mass madness/hysteria. Just too many unstable people hurting themselves for way too long.
Sara: demons aren't real girl???? your bf is one
RYAN?! What have you done?!?!?!
Ryan, Ryan… tut tut. You should know you can dance with the devil all you want, but you’ll only join him when your hand locks with his. And you got swept up in the moment, taking his hand and now the Professor suffers from the consequences; which is that of a tyrannosaurus-rex’s digestive system.
Spoiler . . . . Canonically dead? Not if my fanfiction has anything to say about it
RYAN HOW COULD YOU SAID DONT DANCE WITH THE DEVIL AND THEN DID IT
oh my god RIP the professor T^T i miss him so much i hope his funeral is bangin
does he look like a lighter shade of blue?
I wish one day for another episode with Kate
IM FUCKING CRYING THE JOKER MASK THEY GAVE RYAN FOR LIKE 2 SECONDS AT THE END SJFHBSDKF
I can’t believe Ryan didn’t include Ricky Goldsworth.
"Canonically dead"? Damn...that's bold. I respect that... 🤠👌😶😢
PROFESSOR, NOOOOOOOO!!!!!
the lesson I got from this is you gotta eat 🤷🏼‍♀️
🤯😱 HOLY JELLYBEANS!!!...WAIT THERE'S STILL GOING TO BE A SEASON 5 RIGHT?!?!
Not the Professor 😩😩
AHHHHHHHHHHH
SAY PSYCH RIGHT NOW
why was Ryans laugh at 4:10 sound so forced and manic... I'm concerned
plot twist: it was Ricky Goldsworth all along
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TAKE IT BACK
As a Obey Me player, I’m surprised Mammon wasn’t part of it! Guess that was Asmo’s idea, Levi and Satan just had to go with it.  And Luci definitely has a well organized list of possessions occurrences.
The missed opportunity for Ryan to write down "Ricky Goldsworth" as one of his demons is infuriating
WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED
Professor. 😢😭😥
IM SORRY WHAT AAAAAAAA that was SO worth the wait BUT ALSO WHAT
holy shit?????????????? professor ;-;
Season...5...?
just waiting for the right clicked wikifeet picture to become an nft at this point
👁👄👁....
I actually knew the trick question! This is a super popular story in paranormal circles uwu
........ ok that was fun :D
Holy cow! What a finale! The song was incredible, the history was fascinating, and the Professor and his guests were delightful! Excellent work; it was well worth the wait!
*sniffle*
Boogarah
...I am not okay....wtf...so much to unpack...
I love them
The professor better be resurrected or I will scream. Simple as that .
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
NO, PROFESSOR!!!
Who is editing all this?! INCREDIBLE 😭😭😭 Y’all could’ve made this a Halloween special on Patreon or something & I would’ve gladly paid 🥺💕  We appreciate all your hard work  👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
They killed the professor, wtf
OMG, I've just realised that this is what that old Oliver Reed film _The Demons_ was based on!
well damn if u guys wanted to end puppet history u could’ve just said so 😭😭
@15:32 Nice try Professor! I’ve seen The Devils, it’s all the above!  EDIT: My niche knowledge of Euroschlock has prevailed!
Fantastic Finale!
40mins long, they're spoiling us
this is the bad place
what even....
Noooo, the last episode 😭
I have All notifications turned on and still didn't get notified for this one 😬😔
NO NO NO NO NO
I thought ryan was gonna like attack or strangle the professor while going for that last jellybean poop. I can say i didnt see that coming but was still a funny ending lol maybe he will be rencarnated by fossilized dino poop. Since poop seems to be prefessors secret power hahahaha  I still blame the genie haters for this one!!!!!!!
I'm in total and utter shock
Guys, the party was a trap for the genie to change the puppets back to normal. You can see it behind the genie at the ending.
I mean, Ryan, you must absolutely do everything to undo this unholy mess you have created... You could theoretically ask the Genie (whom you know quite well now, for better or for worse....) for one wish to make the professor come back and undo his canonical death.
Favorite understated moments:  The dig at Unsolved Sarah pointing things out The trophy is empty The implication that The Professor at full strength is more powerful than a demon The abundance of veggie trays
Wha- Prof!? Canonically?! Noooooooooo Okay guess that’s it for puppet history :/
Nooooooooo!!! We will never see the professor or puppet history again!!😭😭😭😭😭
Right when the devil laughed in the end my sreen froze and the lights went out in my flat. It was just a power outage and everything went back to normal in a few minutes, but I got really scared😂😅
Was it 'worth it' Ryan...?
RYAAAAAAAAAN!!!!!!!
I STG IF THIS IS A SERIES FINALE IN DISGUISE IM GOING TO FUCKING CRY
damn we already got r.i.p. merch lmao
No wait!!! Does this mean no more Puppet History??? 😭😭😭
Sooooo.... no season 5??? 😱😱😭😭😭
Oh god im an hour late and im nervous....
R.I.P The Professor and Puppet History :(
Holy. Cow. I knew Ryan would betray the Professor! Please tell me there is a season 5! SOMEONE TELL ME THAT HE IS COMINH BACK!
I REFUSE TO BELIEVE PROFESSOR IS DEAD!!??? I am gonna cry my own river of tears now wtf
I don’t even know how to feel
Absolute brilliance 😁
Hay you better bring him back
🪦
Youre a demon........non-beliver??? HOW DO I SPELL?
This is what happens when a bunch of rich pampered ladies decide to have their own convent. God likes testing their sanity. 😁
I was honestly expecting Ryan to get a bean boozled jelly bean at the end but i am still pleased with the outcome
RIP Professor. I hope you are made into some dinosaur poop that gets fossilised and then thousands of years later we can extract your DNA and bring you back to life.
Wait…
i mean, if god and the devil canonically exist, i see no reason the professor can't keep professoring on from the afterlife. season five real!
PROFESSOR!? Uh what just happened?! What. What what. Awesome episode. I have so many thoughts running through my head right now oh my god oh my god
But...... What am I supposed to watch now on Fridays? 😭
As man, it's all like really over and stuff... awwwwww man.
This episode both broke my heart and was the greatest thing ever ❤️‍🩹
Oh, possess me, daddy Mo!!!
Ofc Sara's a shaniac💀
Uhhhhh I'm sorry Ryan you had a bad experience with the whataburger. Don't knock it though.
is it weird that I'm actually sad over the professor's death?
This event was the basis of my favorite film of all time The Devils (1971).
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO PROFESSORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
Plot twist!!? So excited for the next season. Ryan is going to become the professor and has to use his history knowledge to claw back to the professor. My prediction anyway. Great job Watcher team!!
did they straight up mention angels as demons that possessed them? smh their demonology fucked
Jim Henson would be proud (and a little confused)
great job also just wondered is this the last episode of the show of the show?
I can hardly wait for Shane to announce his new show all about fossils.
You need to tighten up your spam filter. The comments section is riddled with pr0n spammers. To hide, they spam replies to real comments. Also, RIP Professor. ;( I'll miss you.
2 minutes in the passive aggression coming from all three of them is abundant
Professor nnnoooo!!!😅
Ryan.....boyyyyyyy.........start running
The Professor can't be dead! I reject this ending! **sobs uncontrollably**
Clearly there is no way for the Professor to come back from this and we will never see him again. What a perfectly satisfactory finale with absolutely no loose ends.
ryan, are you happy with yourself?? was your trophy worth it??? was it worth the life of another????
Nooooo.... I need more :'(((( How could you Ryan?! :(
WHAT!? Nope. I reject your reality and substitute my own! Ryan will save him somehow, because he'll be too guiltridden not to.
BRING HIM BACK
We will be holding vigil for The Professor tonight at 11:00pm. Please bring all history books and jellybeans you can folks. Time for the mourning period. Ryan, I expect you to be dressed as the Widow that totally didn't kill her husband.
What?!?
Ryan!!!! We will not take this whataburger slander.
this can’t be the end right 😢😢😢😢
I WAS SCOURING THE INTERNET FRIDAY AND SATURDAY TRYING TO FIND THIS EPISODE
WELL OK THEN
Season finale already??
ITS ALREADY OVER? NO
STOP HE CAN’T BE GONE
wtf Professor nooooooooo!
What a perfect song for the season finale well done professor well done!
EEEEEEEEE So good!!!!!!!!
How dare you
is this the end?? this cant be the end. just a fever dream at the end.
I feel like Shane(and by proxy, The Professor) is the type of person who is fine with bullying Ryan, but the second someone else does it he is ready to throw hands; basically the "Only I am able to bully this person" trope.
The Professor describes all the horrible ways the nuns changed physically “The doctors didn’t find anything wrong with them” Me: 😐
I need allllll of the songs on a Spotify playlist like today 😂😂😂
omg ryan’s clown makeup 😭😭
Yeah there's a movie about this. The Devils.
Haven’t seen the full vid yet, but I feel like this topic is foreshadowing somethin’ w/ Ryan...    Damn it I knew it.
"Sara Rubin my moon and stars" MY HEARTT!!
Is anyone else crying 🥲 no? Just me? 😭😭😭😭
OH NO! Professor! The plot just gets thicker and thicker 😱 Now I’ll definitely have to come back and see what happens next 😉 thanks for the great season.
um...... how does one say "no, not the professor!" in the cretaceous period, please?
The Professor's impression of Don Pardo could double as an impression of Mr. Ed
I--? #!?/&!%??#?>#% HELLO?????
It's been an hour since I finished watching the finale and I'm not doing well. I'm mentally crushed.
WAIT NO..FUCK. I KNEW IT. RYAN WAS PLANNING SOMETHING. FUCK. MCNASTY CAN NOT BE GONE. FUCK.
RYAN DON'T YOU DARE INSULT WHATABURGER IT'S GOOD AHHH
"Come Moon and Star,  Gaze upon the Puppet of History"
I love how onboard Sara is with this whole thing, she's so supportive  EDIT: RYANS THE JOKER!?
Noooo
OmG!.. I never thought I would hear these words, but there needs to be more puppet episodes!
Why does all the fucked up shit happen in France? Dancing plagues, giant wolves, poison, now demonic possession. What is going on in that country?!
This sounds like the movie The Devils
CANONICALLY????
LOL “it’s a me! Dracula!”
Ryan deserves a perfect attendance award.
Matpat where are ya
Demons : BE FRIGHTENED MORTALS  Humans : Oooooooooo Haaaaaaaa
shane what the fuck
nOoOooOOoOo not the finale 😭😭😭
The genieonic possession of ryan bergara
For some this is just a stupid show where we come and hear songs ans learn history. But I truly believ this is one of the best story telling and character development there is on youtube. love the show!!!!!!!!!!!!! Love from Malta, Europe!
RYAN WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
This season was SO GOOD !! Every song was a banger and the lore was the cherry on top <3 can't wait for more !! RIP Professor
hey what the fuck
You cheeky bastards
what
Shane will be devastated when he hears of this. The new Professor merch at the end made me laugh through my tears.
I FUCKING CALLED IT!!! THE GENIE AND THE DEVIL TEAMED UP AGAINST THE PROFESSOR
Hell Yeah Mcnasty time!!!
Asmodeus might be my favorite musical number yet… idk what that says about me
thanks a lot ryan, you suck
😧
CLASS DISMISSED??!!  IM SORRY NO WHAT WRONG STOP NO WHY-
WHAT DID I JUST SEE HAPPEN?!
WHAT WHAT SOMEONE HELP YHE PROFESSOR!!
Professor noOOOO!!!
WHAT THE FUCK
I can't wait for Ryan's redemption arc next season
Does this mean the end of Puppet History?
Wait if the professor is canonically dead, then will this mean a return to the hotdaga series?
this episode dropping on a sunday is really the icing on the cake
Season 5, the professor died goes to heaven and god brings him back to punish ryan for his deed.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE PROFESSOR IS CANONICALLY DEAD WTF NO ABSOLUTELY NOT YOU BRING THAT BLUE LOVABLE FUZZ BACK IMMEDIATELY
THIS IS SO FUCKING RAD!!!!
Wait NOOOOO, BRING BACK THE PROFESSOR! I've learned more from him than school ever. I need the professor
HOOO BOI THAT ENDING DAAAAAAANG
rip the professor, my favorite among puppet kind
Okay THAT was a finale. When's the album dropping?
Is this- is this the end of puppet history?
👁️👄👁️
I'm severely disappointed that ricky goldsworth didn't show up even if hes only buzzfeed but good season finale overall
Just finished and....  S P O I L E R  Nooo the proffessor!! Noooo!!!!
Wow I cant wait for next season where Ryan realises what hes done and goes to the genie for the professor's old powers so he can save him.... That's what they're doing right?  Right?!
THE LORE HAS BEEN COMPLETED !
Im going to come for you all if the professor is really dead
The photo of the professor has a wikifeet water mark, truly he will be remembered in all our hearts
The A-S-M-O-D-E-U-S part scratches my brain SO HARD 🤤🤤
I'm here for any and ALL Buzzfeed slander 😂😂😂
I hate to say it…. But the Genie’s kind of… dare I say… attractive. In a “pulled this eldritch being out of a dumpster in New Jersey” kind of way.
well that was an unexpected ending. i think ill light some incense and ring a bell and pray for the puppet.
WELL HOW IS THE NEXT SEASON GOING TO RESOLVE ALL OF THIS??????
I will not stand for whataburger slander!!
1:26 holy shit was that goldsworth lore
The minute I heard the name Grandier I just had a VIVID flashback to Brows Held High's old episode on the movie The Devils which is uh, loosely (to put it mildly) based on this event
If there is a Season 5, here's some suggestions for topics.   1. The Life and Adventures of Grigori Rasputin.  2. Ned Kelly: The Australian Iron Man. 3. The Credit Mobilier Scandal: A Boy Named Train.  4. Han van Meegeren: The Forger Who Fooled the Nazis.  5. Ashikaga Takauji: Like Benedict Arnold, but More Successful.  6. Project MK-Ultra: Fighting Communism with Mind Control.   Just, you know, throwing that out there.
Lets be real, when Ryan went silent for a minute digging into his Mind Palace, he was having Sallie House Flashbacks and Steve Goatman's Revenge
HOLY FUCKING SHIT DUDE!!!
I refuse to believe and accept that the Professor (and, by extension, Puppet History) is no more. This will not stand!
I FUCKING LOVE SHANE AND RYAN !!! BEST EPISODE EVER THE PROFESSOR WILL BE OK ❤️
I feel like the comments are not adequately reacting to what the fuck just happened
He hates Whataburger????? The best goddamn hamburger in the country??? FUCK YOU, RYAN BERGARA!!!!!!!
Nooooooooooooooooooooooo
Oh shit, I knew Ryan was up to something with his whole nice schtick
no no no just because the professor is cannonically dead doesnt mean he cant be cannonically revived please god no dont let puppet history end
ok can we talk about the wikifeet reference at the end?
Is it bad I'm crying over what happened at the end?
Fs in chat
Boy, this is the one show that keeps me going every week, sure would be a shame if anything bad happened to the host to put it in danger
wellthat...took a turn...
What.  The hell.
Is the series over? That cant be, please don’t tell me that’s the case This show is all I’ve had to look forward to during these awful times
AMAZING 10/10 BUT BRING THE PROFESSOR BACK
I think its wrong how the professor treats ryan but I dont think he deserved that. Poor professor
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Oh no. I'm crying. I'm emotionally distressed. Is there no more future Puppet History? Did the Professor have an assistant? Why would you end it this way?  (I'm trying to be spoiler free)
Sara: demons don’t exist  Me: you’re literally dating one
"Weird Stuff in Old-Timey France" is its own genre of Puppet History episodes at this point - I hope they cover Tarrare
That song is banging 🎶 🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹
Watch out Ryan, I’m coming to avenge the professor and the rest of the puppet cast so you better treasure that trophy while you can >:|
EXCUSE ME, WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?  For real tho. Such a good series! The numbers are amazing, the set, guests, editing, etc. are divine. The narration of the topics are well-thought out. The lore is such a good "side plot" and the way they revealed it by bits (except this damn episode) really played in the suspense. GOOD JOB, WATCHER TEAM!!!
😮😮😮😮 Pr- professor??? PROFESSOR!!!!!
I think we all knew Ryan was up to something but this... Ryan, how could you?
already season finale :( sadness...I love this!
Whataburger will make you shit through a keyhole and perhaps projectile vomit, I'm gonna agree with Ryan, even though I am a shaniac
Ready set scream 😱
Nooooo…Professor, come back!!!
OH MY GODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Holy shit what a season finale wow
7:05 sounds like a rave
Wtf ryan doesn't like whataburger u stay away from us ryan that shit is delcisous
i'm devastated
"Canonically dead FYI"   Doubt.
Group of elite, politically powerful individuals conspire to murder a man because he offends them, lying their heads off to the public and buying off local law enforcement.  Puppet History: "Can't think of a moral lesson *anywhere* here..."
Professor we will never forget you, you were the best teacher there ever was, and ever will be. I was waiting for that dinosuar mouth to explode and you coming out of it like a chad but you never did. R.I.P
CANONICALLY DEAD?!?!
The Devils by Ken Russell is my favourite movie, so, I knew most of the story and was actually surprised how much the movie got right Also, holy shit, Shane, how dare you making such an ending
Spoilers    Cannot wait for next season when Ryan, driven by guilt, tries to take over the professor's class and fails so hard at it that the genie brings the Professor back out of sheer pity/disgust
Wait it’s already the finale?! It went by so fast!
My only hope is that he's gonna meet up with the Boston molasses horse and escape 😔
Next time you consider that America might be a bad place remember Grandier
well im sad now
he can say "canonically" all he wants it wont stop us from trying to theorize the exact opposite
WHAT’S GONNA HAPPEN TO THE SHOW?!
The Nuns were smokin that good ishhhhhhh 👍🏻😑👍🏻
Oh my god ??????
My professor shaped heart is broken
What
Anybody else notice that behind the genie, all the puppets turned back into objects?
I love Ryan’s shirt so much
They should have had the goatman be the one to possess him lol Also so there's no more puppet history ever again? Boo
I ... I love this one
Ergot poisoning
Oh my god, the Electric Light Orchestra vibes with this song
Why does it have to be the finale?! 😵😵😵🥲🥲🥲
Omg 😱  Are we gonna get a Halloween special
I'm crying, Watcher. Is this what you wanted? To make a grown person cry over a puppet? Congrats. You got your wish. Just like Ryan did.
MISSED OPPORTUNITY FOR ASMODIOUS TO SAY “AIGHT IMMA HEAD OUT”
Spoiler for the episode:     Excuse me but if you’re ending Puppet History for good I’ll be UPSET!!! I luv that series!!! The professor can’t be lost forever!!! Also I loved the whole “what did it cost?” “Everything.” Like wtf a marvel reference!!
Is there going to be a season 5? Please say YES!
*SPOILERS*      Congrats, Ryan :)
God DAMN
Sara is always my favorite guest! What a precious ray of giggles and sunshine. MORE SARA CONTENT.
Ryan is way too scared to mess around with demons let alone the devil himself!
Why would you kill the professor 🥲
I mean the dinosaurs went extinct in the Cretaceous sooooooooooo... petrified pupper professor reappearance perhaps? He has been through a lot.
HOLY SHIT
:0
Ryan looks high as fuck in this one. Not judging. Lovin' it
love Ryan’s “first day of third grade” outfit
stop, this song slaps really hard
literally insane, best episode of the series. Also I'm getting hot daga vibes with that ending? The professor's side adventure is the hot daga of watcher
Killing the professor was already brutal but killing the propeller and all the other puppets?? Damn the genie really has some issues.
Holy mac and cheese. What an episode. The climax?????😳😳😳😳😳😭
What a twist
hey what the fuck
So the fact the professiors bag aka his life source(?) is okay means he will be too right? Right?!
Quick, someone play carry on my wayward son, that always works to reverse canon, right?
I literally set an alarm for when this went live and now I don’t know what to do with myself
guys what the heck
Is this what people call 'Fashionably late'?
Soooo when does the rescue mission begin?
For next season, you HAVE to do Gregor McGregor and the kingdom of Poyais
No spoilers but WHAT THE FUCK 😱
NOOO!!!!
i'm gonna need 3-5 business days to recover from this, don't reach out to me, i'm in mourning
The lore. The lore tho.
OMG DID ANYONE SEE THE CLOWN MAKEUP ON RYAN TOWARDS THE END? 41:01
the first puppet pop-in took a cue from Taylor Swift's tiktok
I found this in my recommendations one day. I am excited when ever I seen a new episode in my notifications.
pouring one out for the professor </3
Professor is hitting on Sara hardcore "my moon and stars" that's some Khaleesi and Drogo shit right there
amazing ep but i just have a teensy little question about the end?
I am choosing to ignore the end and say this isnt the series finale :)
That ending has me on the edge of my seat omg I must know what happens next-
I want to see that scene before the editing oml
can we appreciate ryan's shirt
What the hell just happened
BEST. EPISODE. EVER!!!!!!!!!!
The amount I’m crying tho-
Loved the ending, specially on how it has absolutely zero lore and how zero regrettable decisions were made on Ryan's behalf
Lol... how sad am I that I teared up when Ryan got the extra jelly bean?
Nooooo!
MY HEART !!
WOW I LOVE LORE
I'm SO GLAD that the professor stayed true to his word and made sure this season had absolutely no lore. This was the least interesting, most lore deficient season yet and I can only hope we continue to get no backstory to this show whatsoever is the subsequent seasons
Does that mean we're going to get a new professor next season or is Ryan going to go looking for the professor?
Canonically dead Professor couldn't get better than a wikifeet stock image 😭
Bringing those all Angel Sanctuary memories with all the demon names
Oh fk, Profesor, nooo! Good work from Sara and Ryan!
THE PUPPET!!!! RYAN NO :O
Now I'm just sad :( Does this mean that this was the final season of Puppet History? :'(
Wait is the song on Spotify???
OK, I have questions. Number 1, how dare you?
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
So help me if this is the end of Puppet History... Bros, with Unsolved ending,, my heart can only take so much
WAITFUCK THST CANT BE THE END
Hey in the future if you guys could add a timestamp for the flashing sequences instead of just a warning that would be awesome!!!
Rip that puppet ayeeeee
*me starting this thinking the big surprise is Shane proposing*: Yes let’s go I’m so happy for them!  *me finishing this episode and seeing the actual surprise*: Well f***k…
The sounds made at 16:23 caught me so off guard
How is it already the season finale?!?!
why doesnt youtube notify me anymore about new videos? even when the bell and being subbed and refreshing 200x
“The nuns claimed they saw a skeleton roaming the halls.”  Me: “Ladies, can we stop bullying Sister Mary Johnson? She’s still getting over her eating disorder and you’re not helping.”
Ricky Goldsworth what have you done?? 😭
I don't know, they may be skeptics of demon possessions (because obviously these nuns were just being ridiculous), but those death curses are nothing to scoff at 😬 ! (First there's Jacques de Molay getting a king and pope, and then there's these frauds getting  offed after their needle spree). As they say: a lie may take care of the present, but it has no future... In this case quite literally...
RYAN, HOW COULD YOU. HE TRUSTED YOU.
Season finale???? Y'all just got started :(
Oh no, does that mean Puppet History is over? I learned a lot stuff from the little Blue guy😭
NOT THE LORE???
NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
i- is this the end?  but really that was an awesome video
Can anyone give time stamps on the "certain sequences may affect photosensitive viewers" parts? I hate to have to skip the entire 40+ minute video if there's just a couple of minutes...
professor gave ryan his last jelly bean I'm crying pls that's so adorable 😭
Someone should probably let Shane know that the Professor is flirting with his girlfriend.
“I’ve done it” RYAN NO
The FANTASTIC FINALE aside, you can't just k1ll3d off the Professor like that??!!!¡¡ NooooOoOooOOO Professor come backkk Ryan do something!! :(
So Ryan really did make a deal with the devil..
if yall see a bot replying to a comment report them for spam
Interesting that Ryan didn't write down Ricky Goldsworth ...
I would love to see the bloopers of this show
Now we need the Hot Dog to make a surprise appearance and to blow up some dinosaurs and rescue the Professor, I wanna see a Hot Dog puppet
That ending, WOW.
i will never not be in love with puppet history
NOOO
Why am I actually going to cry over a little puppet man ?!
NOT THE PROFESSOR
Just real quick- wtf?
I don't wanna spoil it. But NOOOOOOOOOOO WHYYYYYYYYYYYY also wtf was I watching a movie?? THAT WAS EPIC! but why.
WHAT HAPPENED AT THE PARTY
I'm traumatized. RIP little fella. Ryan, how could you?
HOLY FUCK RYAN HOW COULD YOU
oh dear
Guess there won't be a coffee shop AU where The Professor returns from being a T-Rex snack to forgive Ryan and offer tutoring at the local Starbucks in an effort to help him win on his own.
It can't be the end. :(
Dude what a finale!!!!! Can’t wait to see what comes next.
It’s so weird to see Shane’s face
WAIT A MINUTE, THAT SHIRT THEY HAVE ON SALE  I can't believe Watcher is profiting on the death of an icon. smh
I can't believe they really liked of the professor! R.I.P. History King
OH MY GOD PROFESSOR NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Amazing finale though!!!!!!!!!
41:40 omg why wiki feet?😭
We got to go save the professor!
Holy shit! The Asmodeus demon design is based on the claymation Life And Adventures of Santa Clause from the 80's! Those bastards scared the hell out of me as a kid. Nice job, Shane!!!
hey quick question: what the fuck
Don’t appreciate the Whataburger slander from Ryan lol
5:52  It’s nice to see that my boy made it big
So is the devil going to be the new host of puppet history? 😂
so like the sfx team is getting a raise right
I thought Ryan was gonna be the genie, really. Absolutely love this series. This was fun.
next season is Ryan v Genie hand to hand cage match
Does this mean There’s not gonna be a season five
And here I thought I knew where this was going when I read the title...RIP Professor *sniff*
Are we gonna gloss over the fact that Ryan got both jellybean and trophy? What has this become
:(
NO! Professor! You cannot do this to us!!!  Noooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!
Poor Professor I'm actually sad☹️🥺😢
Well there goes my favorite blue puppet
this was my first time watching puppet history after being subbed for so long too! lol great episode
W H AT
Concerned parent: "Hello, I need your help. Its my daughter, she's acting so strangley and none of the doctors can figure it out. I think she might be possessed."  Priest: WE GOT A LIVE ONE BOYS! GET THE SAMPLE SIZED HOLLY WATER WERE HITTIN THE ROAD!
W T A F??????? 😱😱😱 PROFESSOR! NOOOOOOOOO!!
my heart is broken. it was good while it lasted tho.
Hey guys, love your content but as a person who is photosensitive person a trigger warning is good but it would be far more useful to have the time signature or I have to risk triggering a seizure trying to find where the moments of flash are if I can't find anyone to watch and tell me where the flash sequences are. ❤
Wait...no more history theater?? 😭
40:50 so this has just fully turned into infinity war? 😂
This season was so short!! Noooooooooooooooo! We got to save the professor!!!
What the freaking hell Ryan?!?!?
both my granddaughter and i agree that we really needed the loud out loud laughter that came behind ryans demon memories. thank you.
Ricky Goldsworth would be proud.
people ask you how you are and you have to say that youre fine,but youre not really fine bc the prof was eaten by a t-rex but you can never really get  into it bc they would never understand
They were having seizures. Food borne illness
NO! RYAN, WHAT DID YOU DO? I NEED ANSWERS NOW!
YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO DO THAT TO THE PROFESSOR!!!
Well I think I speak for everyone that happen
Yoosh
Asshddjfkglflskdjej
lol some of the names wern't even demons
ryan what have you done??? i hope your trophy was worth it :(  in other news, sick episode dudes
Guys I think Marvel took it too far with this new phase
This really just does seem like a publicity stunt done by the church to get people to believe in exorcisms and the church and power of God, and thats coming from someone who believes in spirits and demons in some sense
Hey man what the fuck?
MY JAW WAS OPENED FOR LIKE LAST 7 MINS WTF
This was outstanding. RIP Professor. But he didn't say Series Finale!
PROFESSOR NO!
HOW COULD YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!
*We all know that Ricky Goldsworth is the demon possessing Ryan* 😂
" *SINCE THIS ISN'T OF THOSE LAZY SHOWS THAT LEAVES THINGS UNSOLVED* " BRAH
"Bro, why are you manifesting yourself as a skeleton? Your making us look stupid bro."  "Dude, I'm scaring the shit out of these nuns and no one is going to believe them! It's hilarious bro!"
Another week in the heavy heavy book of asking fir SEA DOGS MERCH!!
When the girls' sleepover gets out of control
THE WIKIFEET PFP IM LOSING IT 🤣
I don't think he's gonna stay dead.
THE EVER SO SLIGHT TIKTOK CLOWN EFFECT AT 41:01
Bring back the puppet lore with the professor next year
Please i crave more blue puppet mann
HOLY SHIT THIS SEASON FINALE WAS WILD!!
Was it worth it, Ryan? WAS IT WORTH IT RYAN?!?!?
I love how the comments are all normal because no one has finished the episode to comment on the endinng
Qait omg they put clown makeup on Ryan 😂
Oh so 30yrs before the Salem witch trials. It was like that guy who was ratio-ed lol back then almost was talking about the nuns experiencing folie a deux the shared hallucination or psychosis of people or families in close quarters.
Only this channel could turn a puppet history show into something this unhinged
The real question is, WHEN ARE THEY GONNA PUT THESE SONGS ON SPOTIFY??
So glad the “possessions” got worse after Grandier died idk
oh my... god?
here lies the professor who taught me more about history then my history GCSE. when the dino finally shits u out pls tell me what the inside of him was like
NO!!! D:
So Puppet History is history huh
The professor can't be canonically dead! That's the worst kind of dead!  I really hope there's another season. This series has been incredible, and I'd hate to see it go out on a bummer note like this.
Why the fuck did this episode take so looooong I waited more than a week you bitchessss
I'm not crying , you are 😢😢
Is this the end???? wHAT???
ryan bergara what the fuck have you done
asmodeus song was like reverse veggie tales lol
Im distraught
.....anyway, when can we expect to see every song on spotify
when you said "he's history" i didnt think you'd mean you would make the professor actual history. *shakes fists WAAAATCHHHHEEEEERRRRRRRRRR
NOOOOOO PROFESSOR!!!!!!!!
Excuse me what the fuck ryan
So, no more Puppet History😳🤨😳????
OI WTF
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO99OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Shoutout to Sara for bringing all the comedy there at the end I was scared and needed some laughs
First of all, how dare you.   How am I supposed to go back to work when I’m crying over a little blue puppet man?
sees video length: im in danger
Sarah: I have 0% experience with demons because they are not real.  19th century me:  She’s possessed!!!!!!
this is incredible
Oh nooooooooooo. Professor nooooooooo. (Im not actually gonna say what happens cause spoilers but now I’m sad)
41 minutes Jesus Christ!!!
-please let Ricky out of the cardboard box-
oh...
Whaaaat it's already the finale? No way Professor :((
I’ve been waiting for so long! I love this show!!!
What the fuck?
I can't believe dracula is being voiced by Chris Pratt too
Another interesting episode of learning about some funny history! The ending was certainly totally normal and I'm excited for the next season just like usual 😀👍🏻
shane how dare you do this to us. how dare you.
I should my mom puppet history she wants to show her students now she teaches 11th grade us history
WHAT THE FUCK
Professor Noooooo!!!!
omg ... i'm speechless after that ending, what just happened? i'm gonna need a moment
Heh, "mind palace," nice Sherlock reference there
oh my god that endingggg TEHSJSKS
Just 'cause he's canonically dead, that doesn't mean he can't canonically come back to life.
Spoiler:  wait… no more puppet history? Seriously it was the one thing bringing me to the channel?!
I thought ricky goldsworth would have made an appearance
Much awaited!!!
That ending was amazing. I just love the creativity and the learning of this show. Heck, I love all of Watcher's content. It's just that amazing. Awesome work guys!!
Omg the professor...no
They should put this entire episode into the Louvre because it is ART
I am just so amazed by how creative these guys are, they are amazing! And I 'm not just referring to ryan, shane, and steven, its everyone in the Watcher team. Can't wait for season 5 of PH, and excited for their other shows as well! <3
Un oh
Not sure whether to say something was off from the season premier or to just be surprised that this is how things ended....
Is the professor really gone? 😭😭😭 missed the lore ❤
this is the best episode yet I'm in shock
why am I actually crying right now
NAUURRRRRRRRRRR RYAN WHAT DID YOU DO
that was…grim 💔💔💔💔
I wasn’t ready
Ngl, this was probably one of the best puppet history songs I've heard. Visuals + special effects + choreography, just *chef's kiss*
OH (not) LORE??
okay wait what 😐
Oh my god I think the ending might be the best so far I couldn't ask for more
Why am I so throughly invested in the lore and story of a history show hosted by a puppet
Where my holy water at ? 💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦
Nuns: tongues turn black hard and pimply Doctors: “physically fit as a fiddle, nope nothing wrong”
I call bs there’s no way that’s the ending
WHAT
I am SHOOKETH
I'm so sad! Professor, nooooo!
Is... Is Puppet History over now?
NOOOO
Omg that ending
OMG THE TAGLINE FOR THIS SEASON WAS "HE'S HISTORY" AGHHHH IT ALL MAKES SENSE
Oh....oh my
10:07, wrong flag
So. Good.
This one ….. this one stings
Ryan is a king
KSKDKKSKSKSKS HOLD ON DID THE EDITORS PUT ACTUAL CLOWN MAKEUP ON RYAN AT THE END???
29:05 was that-was that the genie? 😳
So remember that “ no lore” shit? Yeah…. Forget about it.
The second I saw the topic I knew this was gonna be good
WHAT DO YOU MEAN CANONICALLY DEAD YOU COME BACK RIGHT NOW IDC YOU BRING HIM BACK RIGHT NOW YOU CAN NEVER STOP DOING PUPPET HISTORY YOU ARE STUCK WITH THIS YOU CANT DO THIS TO ME
oh hey isn't this what The Devils (1971) is about?
NOO WHAT THE SHIT
Just finished the episode  and I have some thoughts, mainly: EXCUSE ME, WHAT JUST HAPPENED???? RYAN BETRAYED THE PROFESSOR AND NOW HE'S DEAD????? WHAT????
wat-a-burger is in pretty horrible. I'm from Delhi, India, and we had one branch near my house. it shut down in 3 months. I tried their burger too, it was, as I said, horrible
A 42 min episide?! Uhh... HELL yeah! 👏🏼
D: The Professor!
just finished and WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED??????
if the professor is gone for good i am beating you to a bloody pulp
can you bring the professor to the next season of supernatural unsolved I think he'd love it
Can't believe the Professor fucking died.
ok thanos
oh boy, HERE WE GO
Is this the end of puppet history?! Please no!
The wikifeet image at the end was the thing that made me absolutely lose it. But also what the fuck❤️
Does this mean there will be no more Puppet History? Unsolved: True Crime has ended and now this? Why do all great shows end? Damn it, not good; definitely not good.
INCREDIBLE SHOWSTOPPING PHENOMONAL AMAZING SEASON FINALE SCREAMING AND CRYING AND THROWING UP RN!!!!!!!!!!
W I K I F E E T
WHAT DID I JUST WATCH??? RYAN... HOW COULD YOU DO THIS!!!!
omg………..
Hell, if I were the accused priest I would have taken some people down with me. Like the judge or the torturers. Like, "yeah, you guys made me do it. These a** holes are the real master minds"  That way they get back what they dished out. If I have to suffer, so help me god I'm taking everyone down with me
On the one hand- that ending, man. :( On the other hand- Don Pardo impressions. :)
Ryan: "I find it's alot more fun to be kind." 🥺 Professor and Sarah: *disbelieving noises*  This is a golden trio of people I swear 🤣
Oh noooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo not the Professor!!!!
Those demon names sound like a list of potential baby names  made by millenials😂
The professor dies the same day as my cat 🐈 this mercury retrograde is some shit 😭
i got bingo on my finale card and i have mixed feelings ab it
I’m ready to throw hands. How could you?!
im sorry WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
What a twist at the end 😱
//spoilers//  MY MAJN MAN THE PROFESSOR IS GONE. HES GONE.   on a more serious note, this episode was incredible! with all the plot twists and everything— it left my jaw open. i’m starting-stuck at your abilities to make this series both entertaining and educational. Thank you Watcher, for everything. <3
I'm shaking, I am literally shaking right now
So beyond ready. Love when Sara makes a guest appearance!
That ending left me speechless
Best time of my life

Shaking and crying rn 😭

What?! Finale?!
PROFESSOR NOOOO
I'm sorry WHAT THE FUCK!?!!!!!
NOOOOOOOOOO PROFESSOR MCNASTY  YOU WILL BE AVEEENGEEEDDDDDDDDDD
NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
This... is.... A puppet history masterclass
I'm surprised these nuns weren't burned at the stake for being witches.
That must have been one hell of a trip seeing Asmodeus on stage irl
:(
Awe My Heart!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The poor Professor :(
I thought i was ready for lore. I was wrong. My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined at the loss of my favorite blue gremlin man.
AYO BRO WHAT JUST HAPPENED?? I CAN'T PROCESS????
AYO WHAT JUST HAPPENED
That finale—  Ryan, how could you?
RIP Professor.  And on that note... Season 5 when?
“Canonically dead” WHAT
what an ending I can't stop laughing the clown face on Ryan at the end oh my god XD
Did they made a profit when they showed off those possessed nuns in public?
Honestly we never should have trusted Shane after Gene who is french fries
WHAAAAAAAAT
Ngl I laughed when they used the union jack for England and the Scottish flag for Scotland when the union jack is also a Scottish flag xD. Idk why I laughed.
[spoilers below] . . . . . . . . . . THE PROFESSOR FUCKING DIED
Has more lore than the mcu
WHAT THE FUCKK
12:54 “what demons are possessing you?” *ricky goldsworth has entered the chat*
Forget Ryan’s joker arc, the ending segment was MY joker arc. Ryan I’m coming for you
>:OOOOOO
God i love puppet history but not woke white girls who can't work out if they're a lesbian or not
RIP to the little guy 😔
I was PUMPED to know this story and it's everything I could have hoped. Ryan. You're a monster.
pardon me while I pick my jaw up off the freaking floor
I think Asmodeus is the most showman singer they've had so far Edit: OH SHIT!!! IT JUST GIT REAL
What?!?!?! No more Puppet History :(   Utter Plot twist with the devil - you did a fabulous job building to this!   Wonderful Episode and another awesome song!   Thank you for another amazing season <3
The professor and Sarah have great chemistry. Shane is about to boil down.
Another bop for the list💅🏽 EDIT: Wait a damn minute😟 what's happening to the professor? Bruh
“Thank God the Devil keeps good copies” what 😂😂
LOOOOOOOOOOOOREEEEEEEE BABY LETS GOOOOOOOOOO
AAAAAAA
What the fuck. What the fuck. What the actual fuck. How am supposed to even begin processing what just happened?
Oh No!!! Is he gone.. for real? O_O
Sarah’s drawing style makes me happy 🥰🥰🥰
RIP Professor
"These people are making a mockery of the science here"  Sounds like a parody of something Ryan would say instead of something he actually said
I AM SO FREAKIN READY FOR THIS  Update: I was NOT ready for that. Holy shit.
OMG, please don't let this be the series finale!
No gonna lie. I did  not see that coming.
Umm, wtf?
Present
The wikifeet watermark lmao
F
😦
That Wikifeet watermark though 😂
I’m so surprised he didn’t bring Shane for this one. I hear that guy is a bit of a demon expert.
“Did you do it?” “Yes.” “What did it cost?” “… everything.”
Professor: Have you ever had experience with demons?    Me: Ryan had, many times, He took over the goatman's Bridge.
I. AM. SHOOK.
WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL JUST HAPPENED
My Jaw was on the floor the entire ending segment
wait, he’s dead ☹️
YUHHHH
RYAN HOW COULD YOU
Wait? What just happened?
WHAT THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED!
i waited 3 days for Ryan to exposed for working with the devil and it was so worth it
Well damn
IM SHAKING OMG THIS WAS SO GOOD! THE LORE IM LOSING OT THIS WAS ICONIC
Holy shit the ending is wild
Ryan nO!
The Professor:  Is a sentient puppet. Personally knows a genie. Doesn't believe in ghosts.
oh God....
WHAT JUST HAPPENED  🧍🏽‍♀️
So Ryan got his wish from "Here is what you do" and came just a little bit closer to Thanos with this lil quote?
Crying and screaming and throwing up rn
holy shit
NO THE PROFESSOR!!
OH MY GOD!!! NO!!!
I CANT TAKE THIS AFTER GENE
HOLY SHIT THE END OMG 😭
SARA IS SO FUCKING FUNNNYYYY
Syphilis is hell of a STD.
shane outdid himself with this asmodeus song god DAMN
EXCUSE ME?!
So glad I have a literal sample size bottle of holy water next to my bed :)
Croissants are actually from Austria 🥲
Wtf i was just thinking dam i shudnt have binged all the puppet history shows. Now i have nothing to watch while i eat a late dinner. Then they go drop this banger. Omg
WTF???
low-key though that Ryan might kill the professor at the end, it was too calm EDIT: OMG WTF
Tim Curry was the best Cardinal Richelieu.
ye olde "Posphorus fucked here!" lol
Maybe albert fish was trying to get rid of demons
I can't believe how much work went into this post production
why does this weird shit always happen in France 😭
14:30 why does this just sound like running through my mania with my psych  lol
Despite being a demon, Asmodeus knows how to put on a show. I absolutely loved.
Evil prostate
THE PROFESSOR DIES??!!??!!
I wonder why the professor never brings Shane as a guest on the show
Why is it always France?
Future ideas: Race to the South. HMS Terror and Erebus. The Ripper Murders during the Blitz. The Burari Family. Nancy Wake. Bonnie and Clyde.
Canonically dead???? NO! No! No! It can't be. I need more history lessons!!
Seriously, demons and religious paranoia is bullshit and a scapegoat for humans refusing to admit that deep down everyone has the ability to be shitty. No one wants to take responsibility for their wrongdoings and want to blame supernatural creatures.
No but imagine how many times Shane actually tried to get Sarah as a guest on the show but held back every time because he knows how much of a deadly combo her and Seasons 1-3 Ryan are.
Really appreciate the photo sensitivity warning! Ready to learn about some spooky history!
"My moon 🌙 and stars 🌟 "  That is so sweet!
me, who went to an ursuline school: sure do wish i was taught about the haunted nuns
I love that the last image is a wikifeet image
“now since this isn’t one of those lazy shows that leaves things unsolved at the end”  damn he didn’t have to do bfu like that
WHAT DO YOU MEAN CANONICALLY DEAD
Idk but something about the idea of the Devil having a very organized filling cabinet made me crack up lol
accidentally skipped to the end and WHAT
Every time he says "season finale," it throws me so much and breaks part of my soul
Joker: Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?  Ryan and the Professor apparently: Yes, don't recommend it though
I'm David S. Pumpkins man! Any questions?
Naughty cardinals
Watching an atheist talk about a supernatural event is about as fun as listening to an evangelical talk about Darwinism.
IM READYYYYYY!
i’d better get some ryan lore here
THE LORE— THE LOREEEEE
“I’ve done it” IM GOING TO SCREAM
the professor's lil "oh!" at 18:28 was so cute hehe
Always love Ryan "two accounts is definitely enough for  a scientific sample size" Bergara.  Edit: ***OH.***
"Since this isn't one of those lazy shows that leaves things unsolved at the end"  not the Professor engaging in BFU slander
Dude it sounds like the head nun may have just wanted to get father flouncy in trouble for knocking up her friend (given that the nuns were all from wealthy local families)
RYAN IS SO SMUG WITH THAT JELLYBEAN
OMG RYAN GOT A JELLYBEAN
haven't watched the video yet but AHHHHHHHHHH OMFG ITS SARA
RIP propeller, you were loved
Come in guys! Get your flags correct! Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿. The Union Jack is NOT the English flag. The Union flag is 🇬🇧. For now…bring on Scottish Independence!!!
THE OTHER PUPPETS OH MY GOD
wait a minute,  this isn't the true story of the NUN, is it? if you didn't watch the movie?
If those nuns were anything like the nuns at my catholic school, they probably deserved it. Physically hitting your students used to be legal but was finally outlawed unless parents signed a “please let us beat your children” permission slip, which most thankfully refused to do. The few who did, the nuns were finding reasons left and right to paddle them even tho they were doing nothing wrong.   If you want psychos, that’s how you create psychos. I left for public school soon after. Horrible place, “Catholic” school.
That priest that asked the demons to possess him just sounds like something Shane Madej would do lol
Convenient that we’re talking about possession today * cough cough * Ryan
OMG I just googled Asmodeus for the hell of it and it says -  Asmodeus, Hebrew Ashmedai, in Jewish legend, the king of demons. According to the apocryphal book of Tobit, Asmodeus, smitten with love for Sarah, the daughter of Raguel, killed her seven successive husbands on their wedding nights  His love for Sarah! Sara Rubin is Shane's girlfriend...
I DON'T PUPPET HISTORY TO BE OVER 😭😭
Obv this is awesome, but what really got me is almost all the French pronunciations being sooo bad. Had to pause a few times because I couldn't stop laughing. (It's okay, sometimes even we can't pronounce this shit right)
finale again? aww that's sad
Oooooh a creepy story super close to where I live, I'm here for it!!!
So sad to see this be the finale, but so happy to be here so early and I'm ready!
"Possess me daddy" is just Shane breaking character
Is this what the nun is based off of?
Can't believe I had to listen to Ryan slander Whataburger like this 😔
Ryan staring into the empty void is a *MOOD*
Ryan insulting whataburger has caused my respect for him to plummet. Now the professor is my best friend
NOW THIS, is definitely NOT the most biased episode yet
finalllllyyyyyy 🎊 ive been refreshing my feed all day long! lets gooo😍
Kudos for the disclaimer about the photosensitivity at the beginning, that was really thoughtful of you all.
spoiler alert: ryan can't touch his toes
"Their faces became so frightful, one could not bear to look at them." Same sis
I don't know much about religions, but I thought that Uriel is an angel?
The fact that Ryan didn't write "Ricky Goldsworth" as his possession name and act like he didn't know what it meant really has me disappointed.   Also, we need The Professor to start his own social media so we can keep up with him in between seasons.   Thank you. 💀
Final Score Ryan 8 Jellybeans Sara 9 Jellybeans  Sara wins, but of course, should a contestant make a deal with the devil to remove the Professor, they immediately win. So Ryan finally wins one... I guess.
PLEASE COVER THAT DEMONIC GROVE ya the one where all those old presidents like to kick it. & cross dress...
guys if you wanted to announce that you're ending puppet history, you could've just said so?
It crushes me that this is the finale already. Some of the best content on the platform 100 percent. I look forward to more Puppet History every week, so I certainly hope for more!
That was quite the ending…not sure what to say… I’m just in shock.
The best finale that there ever was
When weird stuff happened on the same dates (not year) that are important to you… you think you are cursed by kind demons.
My final week of petitioning the ghoul boys to get Bailey Sarian on as a guest for puppet history.
Learning from a human being: this is brilliant. Learning from a blue, time traveling puppet: but I like this.
this cannot be the end
1:10 you can see ricky goldsworth come out for a brief second
As a Texan, Ryan's whataburger comment kinda hurt
not my door slamming WIDE OPEN right next to me several times while watching this 😭 it was the wind but still wtf
Yay its here!
I'm just in time
13:20 was expecting Ricky goldsberg to show up here
Sneaky, the Professor, to make a trick question.
I feel like Shane is the history teacher that we all want.
"And Alex." Dang. I didn't know I was am actually demon. I mean I know I was told I was one but dang
The fact that I read possessions as potassium shows you how much I still have to learn 🤚😔
gaggle is one of my favorite words!
Lol the death puppet from the plague ep
It was a long time coming, but... Congratulations to Ryan! You finally got your win, fair and square! What a satisfying, clean victory. I'm sure he can hang that trophy with pride and absolutely no reservations.
Ryan is possessed
Who would have known puppets could be so….dark?
I love Sara's jeans
Ryan thinking about the bridge he stole from a demon
episode where the special guest is Ricky Goldsworth so Ryan has to compete against Ricky.
This is the best way to spend a Sunday! Thank you for all the great content!
"What demons are possessing you?"  Well apparently there's a demon named Alex so I guess I'm just vibing lol
absolutely losing my shit over this ohmygod what acid trip did i just go through
You know.. if you watch this series in backwards order, it looks like a show where Shane and Ryan care less and less and get sloppy with the execution 😂
"You guys can never disappoint me" awww
The professor is trying to steal Shane's girlfriend. Professor McNasty you're a puppet, not a dog!
13:00 ah, ricky goldsworth
the way i would've actually enjoyed history class if it was taught like this
Ryan's mind must be a terrifying place..
41 minutes?? damn!
Man I've just now stumbled upon this series (shame on me, I know) and have been binging to catch up all day, just in time for the season 4 finale! I couldn't be more pleased.   Sad to see it go on hiatus again but I'm hopefully looking forward to the return of a show that includes an above average number of spirits. 👻🎃  Love ya boys (n gals).
Solid Sara assists there at the end. I cracked up each time.
THE CONJURING???? THE NUN????
AHHAHSHSHSHSH LETSGO puppet history finale!!!
I miss Buzzfeed Unsolved Supernatural
IM ALWAYS READY   Edit almost 8 hours later: I was not ready
France, AGAIN? I’ve lost count how many episodes have been about France now
0h God it was like ryan was back in the sallie house all over again from that reaction 😂
ITS HAPPENING HOLY FUCK
For those of you who are into cinema, this is the story that eventually got adapted into Ken Russell’s “The Devils” (yup, the nun orgy movie)
You should do the crazy court case of Martin Guerre
Why is it the finale already!!! 🥺
Pupper History with demons?????
Professor: Have you ever had any experiences with demons?   Ryan: Yeah we stole his bridge
"there's no lore!" bullshit, Shane ❤❤
my moon and stars 😭😭😭😭
A man from Loundun Took a trip to London He may have took a folly Cus he was haunted by a ghost o gee golly  Like my rhyme?
YES IM READY PROFESSOR
🤌 It's-a me, a-Dracula! 🤌
It's my birthday today : ))) I'm so happy this video was uploaded a few minutes after 00:00 am , so now I will sit and watch it before I sleep
I'm rootin' for ya Ryan cause I believe in ghosts.
They are late!!!!!
i am seeing i am looking
the black orb pushing down nuns: "move, I'm gay!"
i
"Because they're not real and don't exist" Shane: 👀
Freaking profesor, he’s now stealing Ryan’s show!!
The finale of puppet history is going to lead into the final season of buzzfeed supernatural where the one demonic episode is gonna feature possessed Ryan.
Omg I feel like every other upload is a season finale
Sara is Shane  I see no difference, hear no different hmm
I'm actually on time for class!
This Genie guy should really try to meet Shane, I bet they'll be an awesome duo.      Edit: F for Professor Mcnasty
I love the shade that Sara threw about there being no such things as demons and the faces she made while saying that to Ryans face
Woooooooo!  I was starting to worry that we weren't getting a new episode this week! Saweet!
Sad that the professor didn’t call the B boys  😔
I AM SO EXCITED
I've never been this early for a Watcher video before. Also SARA! YAY!
ryan and sara sharing a braincell, both forgetting they have to write and then picking the same answer was wholesome af
hope you guys have a good day :)
"It would die out and then it would probably evolve a bit or mutate and then come back and kill a bunch more people." Yikes, don't like the sound of that.....
Ryan is either going to win or snap and I'm honestly pumped for both options 🤙
It was nice to see Ricky again
PROFESSOR I'M GONNA MISS YOOUUU
What's inside the chest?
i’m so excited for no lore!!
Finale already?! I'm no longer ready
I know my cousin is watching, so.. Hey, Kayla.

You made my day guys, thank you so much. Keep it up👍✌
Watcher: uploads video about demons on a *sunday* Me: I see what you did there

AHHH YAY
Finally! Please do more Are You Scared. Love you Shane and Ryan! ♡♡♡
Shane must have some serious pull with the professor to get his girl into every seasonal finale!
