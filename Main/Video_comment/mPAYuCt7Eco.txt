Perfect series
And here we are nearly 2 years after the trailer came out. What a shitshow.
Date the premiere to the 2. serie?
Worst young actors ever idk how did they choose baireen and igwien
I always thought that it was crazy that Jordan's whole metaphor for his world is wrong.  You cannot weave on a wheel--you spin on a wheel.  Why did none of his editors correct him?  It is like saying the knife glues as the knife wills.  It is a completely wrong function of the tool.
That looks good.
Yeah... About the quality I was expecting. "360 experience" which is basically a flat screen at the front. But you can move it around and see dodgy foggy patterns all around everywhere else if you want. Why do you insist on calling things they're not?
Someone explain what the 360° crap added to this trailer.
Horrible!!!
Well that was a failure..now i know how lotr will look and where is heading.
What a great show. And what a true disrespect for the books. So many things needlessly changed. If you don't think the source material is good enough to make a show from, then leave it for someone who does.
the witcher 😎😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
That's a lot of Negative statements followed up by being a servant... seems like a fun and light watch through 🤣
Nonsense audio
This reminds me of lord of the rings. It's like a copy cat of lord of the rings
I managed 15 minutes in the first episode. Horrible casting. Might as well hire over cooked noodles to act! I feel sorry for Rosamund, she was wronged!
This "Amazon" Wheel of Time adaptation is horrible!    What a shame ...
Disgusting what you've done with a near perfect story. Not watching another minute. Hope this show crashes and burns
Excellent, I haven't finished reading the first book yet, however I consider it to be one of the best epic fantasy series in recent years. The character of Moiraine has served as an anchor to show this new world, the political intrigues that are just beginning, the magic inherent in the One Power, a very complete mysterious character and at the same time human, sensitive, strong and warrior. I hope to see a lot more of this wonderful world in season two. The evolution of each of these characters that are already taking shape and fulfilling expectations regarding what the Turns of the Wheel of Time holds for them. Thank you for creating such a wonderful audio visual work. May the Light be with you!
Excelente, aun no he terminado de  leer el primer libro, sin embargo, considero que es una de las mejores series de fantasía épica de los últimos años. El personaje de Moraine a servido como ancla para mostrar este nuevo mundo, las intrigas políticas que apenas comienzan, la magia inherente al Poder Único, un personaje muy completo misterioso y al mismo tiempo humano, sensible, fuerte y guerrero. Espero ver mucho más de este maravilloso mundo en la segunda temporada. La evolución de cada uno de estos personajes que ya van tomando forma y llenando las expectativas en cuanto a que le depara los Giros de La Rueda del Tiempo. Gracias por crear tan maravillosa obra audio visual. ¡Que la Luz los acompañe!
I hope with all my heart that there will be no second season in order to preserve the novel itself, this series is simply a disaster and an insult to the masterpiece of Robert Jordan and his memory.
"Evil cannot create anything new, they can only corrupt and ruin what good forces have invented or made." J. R. R. Tolkien   Should have know that they would corrupt other fantasy world.  Some people that want to see world burn.  This show leave bad taste.  Just stay on the books, don't watch this.
Hated the show. They took the names and a general concept then did their own thing trying to replicate the GOT series. They have already deviated so far from the story line of the books that its almost guaranteed to end like GOT.
I thought Mat was the main character?
You just had to go and destroy these books too.  Well,congratulations. Aim acomplished.
This is the most lame, filthy, disgusting, disgusting series in the last few years for me and many viewers. You just have no idea how to make movies based on books. Jordan's fans have been waiting for the series so much, and you completely ruined the books by misrepresenting them! They write negative reviews everywhere. I think it is necessary that the authors of the series see all the reviews of fans of books. Or it was not worth mentioning the name of the books at all.
Ah yes Medieval Europe where black people and yellow people were the majority.
Dislike
Was supposed to go to bed cause I had a crazy work day the next day and I mistakenly watched the first episode at midnight. 🤦🏽‍♀️ Sigh. Let’s just say I slept only 45 mins in the morning before work. I regret nothing!
Dizi hakkındaki fikirlerimi beyan etmeden önce Amazon Prime için birkaç şey söylemek istiyorum. Türkiye pazarına giriş yaptığı neredeyse iki yıl olmasına rağmen yetersiz içerikler ve büyük bir sorun olan Türkçe Altyazı konusuna bir türlü çözüm bulamıyorlar. Özellikle Bollywood film ve dizilerindeki sıkıntı defalarca geri bildirim yapmış olmama rağmen sonuca kavuşturulamıyor. Her defasında Lisans konusunda anlaşma yapılmaya çalışıldığı söyleniyor fakat maalesef ortada ne bir ilerleme ne de bir gelişme var. Hiçbir orijinal içeriğine Türkçe dublaj yapmıyor olmaları da cabası. Netflix gibi güçlü bir rakibin karşısında daha sağlam adımlar atmaları gerekirken hayli pasif bir politika izliyorlar.  İçerikleri orijinal dilinde izlemek benim için her daim daha keyifli olmuştur lakin birçok izleyici için büyük sorun teşkil edebiliyor bu durum. Bahsi geçen 'The Wheel Of Time' dizisinin Türkiye televizyonlarındaki tanıtım reklamını Türkçe Dublaj olarak yayınlayıp platformda altyazılı vermeleri hiç etik bir tutum değil. Abone çekebilmek adına kurnazca düşünülmüş bir girişim fakat bana kalırsa çok çirkin bir yaklaşım. Bu bağlamda ziyadesiyle rahatsız olduğumu da belirtmek istedim.  Diziye gelecek olursak... Açıkçası merakla beklediğim projelerden biriydi ve nihayetinde yayınlanan ilk üç bölümü bugün izleme fırsatım oldu. Oldukça da beğendiğimi söyleyebilirim. Görsel efektler ve seçilen mekanlar gayet başarılı. Kitaplarını okuma imkanım olmadı, doğal olarak bir mukayese yapmam mümkün görünmüyor ancak bana kalırsa uzun zamandır bu türde yapılan en başarılı yapımlardan birisi. Keşke tüm bölümler topluca yayınlansaydı ama her hafta Cuma günlerini beklememiz gerekecek. Fantastik hikayelerden hoşlananlar için izlenmesi gereken bir dizi.
First episode and it took less than 10 seconds to blame all their worlds ills and ' smashed pieces ' On the shoulders of men!!
This show is trash compared to the novels, no fidelity, all "current year".
How many episodes.. Plz release all episodes
well its cultural appropriation of me to watch any shows with non whites in it,, dont want to be labeled a racists so i can not watch it
😍😍😍
😍😍😍
😍😍😍
Wow, the sword of truth looks good!
not going to say who but they kill of one of my favorite the first episode.... grrrr
If you like mythical / fantasy series, I recommend The Outpost by CW television. It has Four seasons roughly 13 episodes each.
Lan where is your stealth cloak? And Thom Merrilin where is your multicolore cloak? And harp and flute? Where you lose them? Perrin where is your Axe? WTF is going on? Rand and Egwene slept in 1 episode WTF?  LOL Perrin have a girlfriend (and he killed her omg) an she is actually a blacksmith )))) Ok Woman Blacksmith in middle ages  what the @F@ with that triple in 4 episode Aes Sedai and two Warders really ? Robert Jordan flips in a coffin!
Wheel of tolerence . Degenerate political ideal program, which is used as a tool for mass destructive education of people.

Robert Jordan flips in a coffin! You twist everything you touch! Witcher! Expanse! Foundation! Now Wheel of Time! Next is Multirace Hobbits and than what BLACK JESUS ?)))) OK ok i'm not such a rasist But I don't see any Black characters That where played by white actors so that is 99 level hypocrisy ))))
Wheel of tolerence . Degenerate political ideal program, which is used as a tool for mass destructive education of people.
See Actrees Julia Roberts of Homecoming lonely at home secutury watch with neighbors .
We want Stargate Jeff Bezos pretty please……
Turned out better than I could have expected I’m now hooked. Best tv series I have watched in a long time something with actual plot!
the acting haha this is starting to turn into a CW series
Wheel of time...Perhaps this should have named Waste of time..perfect..
Looks more like a standard Quest, rise against the Bad Guy, develop your power potential, Fantasy story. Was more impressed by Witcher. Definitely not in the same league as Game of Thrones season 1 to 8.3.
Wow its 360
DISLIKE
You strayed so much from the wheel of time on the first episode (perins has a wife ??? , nynaeve's kindnapping by a trolloc ???, egwen sleeping with rand???) + the casting is so wrong, they look nothing like the way they are described in the books (Except maybe matt and rand) you might as well call this show "The show the resembles the wheel of time series" This show has the potential to be bigger than "game of thrones" ever was , please don't kill it before it even started there is a reason why people love the books , trying to change them completely won't help your cause
is it enjoyable for someone like me Who haven't read The books ?I heard that some the books fans were disappointed by it
Who can let me use his her or Amazon prime so that I can watch the movie pls
What was the point of making this a 360 video?
Has a LOTR feel!
Love this show
our episode kab tak ah ge
que perrón se ve mis respetos para el equipo de fotografía
👏👏👏
Nice
Yeah but let's face it, any good series that comes along will get cancelled prematurely. Examples are The Expanse, Altered Carbon, Dark Matter, the likes of Amazon prime/Netflix etc. They get amazing shows then dump them.
Is there a reason that it's being released late in Australia or is it just to sink up everyone else with the 19th in America and if that's the case why not be straightforward?
Is anyone else’s screen moving around 😂
looks rubbish
I saw Voldemort :D
They bloody made it! Can't wait for mist born to get a Netflix adaptation!
Finding Dovakin.
Humans today and for all time desire power because they know they are spiritual, but they desire the power of Satan, witchcraft, instead of desiring all the real power of God through Jesus Christ, the one who died on the Cross to pay your sin debt from the Fall of Man.  When you see Christ brutalized on the Cross, you are to know that is the punishment you as a sinner deserve before God, but that he took your punishment on himself so that you could live and be born again, washed of your sins, separated from Satan by baptism, and empowered with God’s power by the infilling of the Holy Spirit for the purpose of making you a battleaxe against powers of darkness.  Seek Christ, turn away from Satan, come to the River and into the Light by the accepting Jesus as your blood sacrifice which is the only acceptable sacrifice before God.  Jesus is the door to eternal life.  By Faith in him alone and repentance of your sins and renouncing the occult.
I did not read the books but as as long as those idiots of David Benioff and D.B. Weiss  involved in the making of GOT were not involved in this project, I will gladly watch this series. Really looking forward to it.
Oh great, another Mary Sue story. ONE OF THESE 16-YEAR OLDS SHALL SAVE THY KINGDOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
В упор не вижу формата 360, куда мне нажать чтобы его увидеть?))
Amazon, what time of day will you release this?
Watched this in Youtube VR, this was epic!!
I read the first novel and, balls, it was boring.  The title of the series itself is an admission that the story is painfully derivative, but it could make for a decent TV show.  Maybe.  Wow, those pig head guys look like a bad high school theater class project.
Is she loki’s Mother?
They better not leave out Flaming Son of a Goat Herder Uno.
The Wheel of Woke!
This is gonna be CRAP!!! Bad casting, and they've already f'd up the story
Blood and Ash I can't wait for this
I assume the beginning where Moiraine gave her oath was cut short - she didn't complete the 3rd part!
"it's one of the five of you." NOPE...one of three at that point in the stories. That is one of the fundamental ideas in Eye of the World and they are messing with it already.
i haven't seen a Warder's color shifting cloak...
If this is not 13 seasons with 70 episodes per season i will be disapointed :)
Why must you idiots ruin everything you touch?
Oh my god! One morу category B series with 4.0-5.0 maximum rating. Idiots...
Thank you Jeff Bezos...? I feel so happy right now, I'm celebrating this trailer like my kid just scored a goal! Loving the multi-ethnic cast as well. Like Nu Shooz, I Can't Wait...
Please god make the show decent. The books and Robert Jordan deserve a good adaptation.
great video loved it , even that saidin and saidar between the pictures ! only thing i did not liked was the one of 5 for the dragon's reborn.can't wait for the 19 of november !
now this is a creative way to promote a tv show
Was there any point in making this trailer 360?
One of the five of you?  Uhh... It can't be one of the girls, they can't be the dragon reborn and can't channel saidin.    More and more issues with this adaptation...
Wow, looks like Mat was cast perfectly.
I'm excited to watch this! Why in the world was this trailer in vr tho...
THIS is why I'm getting Amazon video!
Amazon's next series: The Life and Times of John F. Kennedy. Starring Samuel L. Jackson.
The logo should be the snake eating its tail and forming a wheel.  Why is it a coiled snake instead??
Magnificent!
'1 of the 5 of you' I remember the book saying '1 of the 3 of you'
New Rockstars sent me here! I can’t fir this series!
I fully expect this to be ruined by the "Hollywood Agenda"
COOL
Already have Prime video.
What is this garbage. Wheel of Cringe Wokeness.
Let the Dragon Ride Again on the Winds of Time :D
From James bond
Why does this have auto-generated captions instead of creator captions? You'd think a company this large would have taken care of that. Words like "Sedai" get lost in auto-captioning.  [Siuan?] Swear your oath, Moiraine Sedai.  [Moiraine] I swear to speak no word that is not true, to make no weapon with which one person  may kill another, and never to use the One Power as a weapon. [Stepin] Do you know what Aes Sedai means in the Old Tongue? Servants of All. It is they who serve the world. [Moiraine] I didn't choose this path, but I will follow it. [Lan] Where next? [Moiraine] The Two Rivers. The Old Blood runs deep in those mountains. Let's hope it's prepared them for what's coming. [Moiraine] The Dark One is waking. But there will be one who can stand against him, and it's one of the five of you. [Mat] You’ve fully lost your mind. [Moiraine] Your life isn't going to be what you thought. [Lan] Moiraine… [Egwene] What are those? [Moiraine] His army is coming. [Perrin] What can we do? [Egwene] We protect the people we love, no matter the cost. [Moiraine] Our enemies are everywhere. They will leave no one standing. [Rand] We've lost too many people already. I can’t lose you.  [Egwene] You won't. [Moiraine] If we do not stop the Dark One now, the whole world will burn. I can't allow it. [Moiraine] The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills. [Perrin] Do you think we'll ever go back home? [Egwene] No.
.. VFX or makeup departments must not have gotten funding for Aes Sedai agelessness.
Seriously, while i am both excited and scared to see what you have done with one of the best series Ive ever read, i hope there is a non-360 version of this trailer. I dont have time or patience to rewatch it multiple times to catch all the nuances (although someone did note most of them if not all), and trying to "move the camera" with a migraine and understand things just isnt happening 😢🤢🤕
I can't wait to see the Aiel!
Don't screw up this series like HBO did!
Is it available on Amazon Prime India?
Looks awful. Ill hold out hope, but this looks like a failure in vision.
What is the point of 3D if its just a flat screen...
Whom Can We Trust If No One Is Trustworthy? One of my favorite quips from Mark Twain’s The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is when Tom is defined as “a glittering hero…the pet of the old, the envy of the young,” and there were “some that believed that he would be President, yet, if he escaped hanging.” With these few words, Twain captured the essence of leadership in our world. Those who get to the top are the fiercest, most determined, and most ruthless. Today, the latter quality has become so intense that we can no longer believe our leaders, and certainly not trust them to have our best interest in mind. I am not accusing any leader in particular, or even leaders as a whole. It is simply that in an egoistic world, where people vie to topple one another on their way to the top, the one at the top is clearly the one who trampled over and knocked down more people than anyone else. Concisely, to get to the top in an egoistic world you have to be the biggest egoist. So how do we know whom to trust? We don’t know and we cannot know. All we know is that we are in the dark. In a culture of unhinged selfishness, any conspiracy theory seems reasonable, while truth is nowhere to be found. When every person who says or writes something is trying to promote some hidden agenda, you have no way of knowing who is right, what really happened, or if anything happened at all. The only way to get some clarity in the news and goodwill from our leaders is to say “Enough!” to our current system and build something entirely independent. The guiding principle of such a system should be “information only,” no commentary. Commentary means that information has already been skewed. Information means saying only what happened, as much as possible, not why, and not who is to blame and who we should praise. Concurrently, we must begin a comprehensive process of self-teaching. We have to know not only what is happening, but why we skew and distort everything. In other words, we have to know about human nature and how it inherently presents matters according to its own subjective view, which caters to one’s own interest. To “clear” ourselves from that deformity, we must learn how to rise above our personal interest and develop an equally favorable attitude toward others. This is our only guarantee that our interpretation of things will be even and correct. Once we achieve such an attitude, we will discover that the bad things we see in our world reflect our own, internal wickedness. Our ill-will toward others creates a world where ill-will governs, and so the world is filled with wickedness and cruelty. Therefore, all we need in order to create positive leadership—and to generally eliminate ill-will from the world—is to generate goodwill within us. When we nurture goodwill toward others, we will fill the world with goodwill. As a result, the world will fill with kindness and compassion. By changing ourselves, we will create a world that is opposite from the world we have created through our desires to govern, patronize, and often destroy other people.
"The Grave is No Bar to My Call" - I know it won't be in this season but by the light how I look forward to that scene.
Immediately bored.
I’m not sure why she says “One of the five of You” is going to stand against the Dark One like it could be any of them. It’s Rand. Rand is literally the Dragon Reborn. It really ticked me off, Nynaeve and Egwene are not Ta’veren. Wheel of Time was already a feminist series, why force it down our throats. Also the romance between Rand and Egwene is so painfully overdone. They did love each other but mostly as friends later and they never ever slept together. Stop making Wheel of Time woke.
"The Shadow shall rise across the world, and darken every land, even to the smallest corner, and there shall be neither Light nor safety. And he who shall be born of the Dawn, born of the Maiden, according to Prophecy, he shall stretch forth his hands to catch the Shadow, and the world shall scream in the pain of salvation. All Glory be to the Creator, and to the Light, and to he who shall be born again. May the Light save us from him."
1:26 wait was that Lan... CRYING?
We'll drink the wine till the cup is dry, And kiss the girls so they'll not cry, And toss the dice until we fly, To dance with Jak o' the Shadows.
Anyway to turn the annoying 360° thing off? 🙄
Maybe turn the wheel of time back to 1990 and this would qualify as HD
garbage cast, garbage series
I will not support you or your company until you change your studios’ hire policy to be based on merit and not on skin tone or gender.
So excited to see this brought to life on the screen! Thank you Amazon Prime! <3
this is not a 360 trailer experience, this is a theater experience watching a trailer
this is not a 360 trailer experience, this is a theater experience watching a trailer
When does this start
In the Metaverse. All trailers will be like this 🤤 can’t wait!
This giving me Harry Potter vibes
the wheel of fleshlights, *nice.*
i dont get it what is the point of 360 xp here
game of thrones if you got it from wish
Music was so loud you can barley hear what's being said
Things are tough but you know what? We live to see another day.
Narnia for adults??
Would be nice if this wasn’t in that 3D mode. 🤦🏻‍♀️
One is caught up playing the impassioned protagonist in one's Subjective Narrative of Self🎈
Where is Thom Merrilin though :/
The trailer was certainly a lot better than the teaser.
the books were OK it wasn't the best story I read mainly because it copied too much from lord of the rings
Morraine is not beautiful enough I hope this Dune rip off turns out ok
Love when you upload!! Be safe everyone ❤️💛❤️
I have never heard of these books. The monsters look rather cheap.
God I am setting myself up for disappointment SO HARD because I am stupid excited for this.
i had no idea this was in the making and just happen to come by the trailer. if you liked game of thrones then you will love this. this series was the blueprint for others of its nature
What's the point of this?
The Wheel finally weaved us a series!!!!!!! Whooooooooooo!!!!!!
Nope.
I was waiting for this show since a long time.. I'm glad to see this 🙏🙏🙏
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
Coool another beloved series ruined by wokeness! Great job guys!
This is amazing!!!
I really hope they just cut off the rest of the oath at the beginning, because that completely changes the oath of the Aes Sedai, if they just can't user the power as a weapon.
Why do combat scenes with monsters always have to happen in barely visible environments with too rapid shadow changes.  It's super annoying.
This 360 sucks!
The wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel wails as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as the wheel weaves as the wheel wills.
I know I might be alone in not liking the look of the actress playing Moiraine, but I can get past it just for the fact that she sounds so much like how I imagined she sound. I really can just close my eyes and hear Moiraine.
I would like to get a notification when it drops
This wants to be Game of Thrones. The only interesting thing about the trailer was Rosamund Pike.
0:30  Is that....is that Daniel Henney!?!?!!
Can they just not.
"I'm Batman" -Batman
I'm a poor man I made this channel to help my family
Outstanding
Give me your trust, said the Aes Sedai, for on my shoulders I support the sky.
Have no idea what this movie is, just came to say Rosamund Pike is a goddess and everything she does is awesome!
Looks like, made for television crap. I fully expect to hear from all the Liberal fragile's so bring it.
looks cheap and dull
XD why is this 360!?!  I was all excited for a new type of experience where the movie is shot in 360 and you have to pan around to see whats happening. Instead its a 2d screen....BORING!!!
Ok, YES!
Moiraine knew the Dragon Reborn could only be one of the 3 boys.  Why did she say it would be one of the 5 of you, including the girls?  I’m really worried they won’t stay true to the books to try and fit in some PC narrative.  Rand Al’Thor is the hero of this epic saga, but he’s hardly featured at all in this trailer.  It seems to focus mainly on what I assume is Egwene, which makes zero sense.
Absolutely fantastic. 🔥🔥🔥
Professor was already planned for Wheel of time..
Don't... Don't ever do the 360° video for a trailer ever again. That was a horrid experience.
it is a flat screen not 360
Why does it look pixelated no matter the resolution?
I thought this was a fantasy-based comedy at first - is there no trope left unused? every line sounds like piss-take
🥺😭😊
Please do not feck this up.
Let the Lord of Chaos rule.
Loved the trailer, hated the experience.
Tai'shar Manetheren !!!
the wheel is turning!!! lets go!! =)))
Lame???
Diversity and woke crap.  Shame it was not made 20 yrs ago.   I will stick with the books.
She is looking for the Dragon Reborn. What the hell was this it is one of the five of you line? Between the forced diversity in an already diverse book, I really hope this won't be a woke suckfest.
Let's make a 360 degree video and just put the video in the middle and nothing around.  😒
Honestly, I don't get the "360 Experience". It just makes the real trailer (even in 4k) look worse and doesn't offer any added value. Just stick to the traditional way of presenting a trailer without any gimmicks. Because the trailer itself is great. :)
пасхалки при повороте камеры радуют глаз) молодцы!)) ждем
New Rockstars brought me here
You had me at Rosamund Pike.
"One of the five of you" ?   What ?   Been a while since I read the books, but I don't remember anyone thinking Egwene and Nynaeve might be Lews Theran Telamon reborn.
So excited
Why would I want to watch a trailer like this
"Life is Short Thing" "Girlfriend is Nothing" "Father Mother And God Is Everything" "So support to EVERYTHING" ❤️❤️❤️
""Let's pray for those people who doesn't have food to eat on lock down and for Corona patient "" ❤💜💚💙
"""LET'S PRAYS FOR THOSE CHILDREN WHO DOESN'T HAVE THEIR PARENTS THEY ARE REAL LEGEND"""❤️💙💛❤️💙💚
Tolkien inspired Lord of the rings knock off, WoT age is set in a base pattern of beginning and ending that is corresponding to that of middle earth but they did a tacky job executing middle earth attire, tavaren cavalry but mainly the costuming. This whole calamity is generic "the dark one" whom the protectors of the realm would inevitably subjugate. Maybe the novels are refreshing but they did a dull dowdy job on the cinematic adaptation.
""" Congratulations to everyone who comes in every single second """ ♥️♥️🧡🧡🧡
""" Congratulations to everyone who comes in every single second """ ♥️♥️🧡🧡🧡
This is not a 360° video.
Amazon is a horrible company
The woke wheel of time turns as the leftists will.  Does Rosaman Pike still make people Photoshop out her chin because she thinks it's too big?   Since when was Lan asian?  What happened to his blue eyes?   When was the last time you read about an African American Aes Sedai being in any of the books?    The woke wheel of time turns as the leftists will.
OMG OMG OMG!
Please Team, we do need some solid official translation of the lyrics of Al'Naito, fans are just getting wild and their translations don't make any sense. Please 🍃 (Don't listen to Mat from DW, not everyone is nerdy at such a level, you gave them enough time to try and figure it out already, by now. They didn't)
i don't know how they will be able to explain the lore and everything what has happened in books.. It is too grandiosely
എവിടെ എന്റെ മലയാളികൾ???
One of these Five is a Dragon Reborn you say? Have you intentionally put Egwaine in this list to appease the fems?
dajjal
Hmm...I could care less about the pointless 360 gimmick.  For some reason, the trailer itself (which is what I wanted to see) looks low-res and pixely no matter what resolution I set it at.  Maybe a 2D version will be made which plays better? EDIT: nm, found the 2D one.  It plays in HD, so that's the one I'll watch.
Looks pretty bad compared to the books. Sadge
Jr GOT??
I hope it turns out as good as the trailer looks
The wheel of time stops for no one.
Jaby Koay sent me here.. Trailer is fantastic..
Amazing.
with as long as that book series is they better have 100 episodes at least ! :D
There's almost no coordination between the 360 Experience and the trailer.
so beyond excited for things to come out. love the trailer ❤️
Hyped! Just some disappointment that Rand’s screen time seem to be getting less & less every trailer lol.
the trailer looks cool but the yt vid is broken
why its giving vibe of every series = NARNIA + G.O.T + ......
What a stupid way to watch a trailer...
Hated it.
#8 on tending and with1.2 million views but only got 7000 likes? Can't be.
I hate it. I'm not able to hold my mobile steadily.
One of you five. I think am lost here, are we going to have 5 taverens?
Es el momento!!! La Rueda gira según sus designios.... Espero que no nos defrauden.
I came here from New RockStars link. I didn't know this was a thing, but it looks amazing!
Looks great! :)
I thought this was going to be something unique, but it's just another generic story.
Holy crap they're compressing the timeline. And the color grading makes it look like a CW show.
I’m gagggggginggggg🤯🤯🤯🤯.
click bait
*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Narg Smart
The wheel turns just like when your phone turns you.see.less of the trailer. Cool gimmick but please don't do it again
Finish the oath... finish the oath!
rosamund pike was born for the role of morraine.  i hope this series carries through all the books ;)
I've been waiting so long for this...
The ouroboros differing from the book logo is bothering me more than it should. Still totally hyped for this series though
Poorly utilized gimmick. I would have LESS motivation to watch the show because of the lame usage of the 360 experience. And the image quality sucks too.  Looks like 2000's era video couple with a mid 2010 era gimmick.
As long as you stick to the source material this might be good....
Gotta feel bad for Perrin / Nynaeve fans.  Just google those names and see how the book art / fan art have depicted them for literally decades.  Unfortunately for them, this show was produced during that one brief moment in Hollywood where execs were married to their politics and forced quotas on the casting.  Imagine being cast not for your talent but chiefly because you could fill a quota.  What a disgrace.
Wow so so cool
meh
I've read these books at least a dozen times.  The best series ever which is why I can't watch this.  The story is way too complex for the screen.  It would just be frustrating.  Look how they screwed up Ender's Game.  All the subtlety is missing.
Wheel of thrones, i mean wheel of time is looking good
WHITECLOAKS!!!
Amazon was smart and waited for all the books to be out before making a show. HBO take notes.
I see all the "SQEEE it's finally happening", and wonder if anyone is actually paying attention to this trailer.  "It's one of the 5 of you...", umm...what?  There was a waygate in the trailer, which comes after they leave Caemlyn...but Elayne isn't going to be in this until season 2. Rand and Perrin chatting in the Winespring when Moiraine and Lan arrive? Small changes are one thing, but this is already shaping up to be butchered.
Something hidden this way comes.
OMG, it looks right!
Everyone in this show is so out of it and angry looking. And even better, you get to see it in 360 view! You must be constantly spinning as fast as possible to see every detail possible.
It feels so weird to be alone out here on this rock having not liked the books as a sci-fi/fantasy nerd. I devour everything science fiction and fantasy but those books just annoyed me. Gave up partway through the 4th.
the golden crane flies for tarmon gai'don!
I very much hated the Aes Sedai in the books. Misguided, meddling and for all their vaunted wisdom....individually barely 90 IQ. They very nearly not only allowed, but actively worked towards the destruction of everything. The best part of the books is when the Seanchan wreck it and then again when the sisters themselves start to get bonded. Karma.
I'm getting worried after watching all the trailers and focus on the female characters...Is this still going to be the story following the hero Rand al'Thor and his quest to defeat the Dark One?
By this definition of 360 video every video on my phone is a 360 video
Hopefully they won't focus on the Nynaeve/Egwene/Elaine chapters, they were a borefest.
Dame of thrones
OK, watching the 360° view and the taint around 1:50... gave me chills. Cannot wait for this!
Whenever I see the Trollocs I think Krampus and I like Krampus
load of old trollocks !
finally a 360 video where i can look at a screen
Get rid of this 360 bs
Trying to watch this is like how I'd imagine standing in between the travel pane on Shayol Ghul.
WHERE IS THE EXPANSE??!?!?   WANT MORE!!
I can't fucking with the trailer with this 360 bullshit
I got chills from "The Wheel weaves as The Wheel wills"
Yo I thought Voldemort died dawg
What’s up with this weird view that is turning a I move my phone?? I hate it, I just want to watch the video
Diversity quotas on point son.
Overrated, Tropish, repetitive books (pre-Sanderson) revamped for quotas.
Please, don't suck.
Look to the right at 1:50 🔥 👄 🔥
Is this The Eternals
DOVIE ANDI SE TOVYA SAGAIN!!!!  I'm just glad that the WOT is gonna be a show.  I'm so grateful that these works are being put to film.  Even if its terrible, forced, YA drama.  There's 0 chance it doesn't get more people interested in the books, drawing fanart, making theories, evolving the pattern.  I hope for its success with all of my heart, and I will be there on Nov 19th to see.  Lets roll the dice on the biggest moment of fantasy since lord of the rings hit theaters.
That was the most frustrating experience ever. I don't want to keep turning my phone just to watch a movie trailer. I can be interested without spinning
Best trailer yet can’t wait for this to be streaming
Meh☹
Amazing 🤩 360 EVERYTHING
So hyped for this and the Witcher
Love this. Read the series a long time ago to my son
Look at all those smooth skirts smoothing their skirts.
This looks so bad.
Why does this look like a CW series?
The trailer started in front of me and halfway through it I looked around. The video moved and I had to sit facing my left to finish watching it. Not the best way to present a video clip. IMHO
At 1:45 you can see Ba'alzamon to the right in the 360 view.
Roda masa
Not a bad Moiraine... not at all how I pictured Lan... but I'm in.
30 minute daniel green video incoming
Dovie'andi se tovya sagain!
Omg this looks like they might just pull it off. cant wait.
So... how many things can they get wrong in one video...  the last of the three oaths was missing a lot of context.  I hope they just clipped it for the trailer. it is Never use the one power as a weapon unless in the defense of self or against shadow spawn.  In the books Moraine and EVERYONE ELSE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD is aware that the Dragon Reborn is a Male, she knows very well that Egwene and Nynaeve are not going to be the dragon.  I just don't get the point of changing the story, It really detracts and will ruin the whole flow of the story.
5 dragons instead of 3 ??? Are the girls also Dragons? Nynaeve is older than the rest, why is she?
I was apprehensive after the first trailer, but this looks like they did an amazing adaptation of the books
Jesus is your free gift to heaven when you believe in his death, burial and resurrection you are immediately saved
Jesus is your free gift to heaven when you believe in his death, burial and resurrection you are immediately saved
Great trailer, annoying and stupid way to present it.
blood and bloody ashes!
This looks much more authentic than some of the other trailers but the wheel weaves as the wheel wills.
It’s hard to watch it like this lmao
one of you 5? pretty sure she was trying to pick from 3, eguane came to learn and nyneve to bring them all back, ig they're playing it like it could be any of them though, kinda dumb imo tbh
And here I am, if my mother come in to my room would think i just turn insane by turning like crazy my phone
I'm so happy and so scared. Please, please don't ruin this. It looks great visually so far. Looks like you nailed the one power look spot on. Characters look good so far. I know some cuts will be inevitable due to the scale of the series, understandable. I just really hope the spirit of this series is solidly portrayed and the cuts are intelligently made by people who have read this series and taken it to heart. Please make this as amazing as it looks in the trailers.
Anyone else notice how she said one of the five of them will stand against the dark one? In the last trailer as well she asked who is the dragon reborn and it flashed through Egwene, Rand, Matt, and then Perrin. I may be looking into this too much but that's just weird to me. Like why even do any of that when even in the books Moiraine thinks it one of three boys who is the dragon, not Egwene and not Nynaeve. I don't see any reason to leave it so vague unless they are gonna throw some curve balls in there. Which I hope to god they don't for the sake of being woke. I like the diverse cast, because it is a diverse world but if they change the plot I'm gonna be disappointed.
Why does the Dark army always have the coolest looking soldiers?
So awesome...
This is so trippy
Pretty, pretty, pretty good.
I would question some of the casting but we'll see.
jesus christ... lol no, I don't want your budget witcher experience.
THAT AIEL LOOKS AMAZING
In one Age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose in the Mountains of Mist. The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was a beginning.
I can't wait, but I hate the way this trailer was done.
Tai'shar Manetheren
Let's go Brandon
MOTHER'S MILK IN A CUP!
So hype
They really have one of everything lmao
pleasebegoodpleasebegoodpleasebegoodpleasebegoodpleasebegoodpleasebegood
How do I turn this 360 crap off?
Looks pretty good. That being said, the 3d gimmick did nothing for this video and was really just an annoyance that made me gradually turn my phone during the course of the video.
Dialogue is abysmal. None of the characters talk like this.
What is the point of a "360 experience"if it's just a rectangle of video surrounded by blurry nothingness?
I need to know what music this is
Stewie Griffin is in my head saying, "The wHeel weaves as the wHeel wills."
Fear of death holds not my heart!
I DGAF how much of Bezos's money they have to spend..
Man I love the Wheel of time but this 360 thing is some gimmicky BS.
0:10 - Moiraine swears an oath 1:43 - Moiraine breaks said oath  In the books, the oath is more precise, for this exact reason.
Looks like but whole
The wheel is here. Can't wait!
I’m freaking out right now dude 😮
Start Plan Beijing
Can I just watch the trailer without it being a rollercoaster simulator?
Wow the 360 really adds to the experience LOL
The trailer itself looks good. The 360 is super pointless.
Oh my god this looks just like I imagined! 😀
What was the point in making this 360°?
Not sure why this is in 360.   It’s a 2D 1920x1080 video in a 2D 360° environment that isn’t worth ignoring the trailer to look at.  At least if it was a 3D version of the trailer it would have been worth cleaning off the lenses on my Google Cardboard to check it out.
Lame 360
Young adults/teens in a fantasy or a scifi setting is always a red flag but people who read the books look pretty hyped... might watch the pilot and see if it's really as good as they say.
Been trying to stay away from this so I can watch it without much prior info (other than being on my 5th read through). Gotta say, this is getting me pumped. Other than that tiny thing Rand is holding which is extremely disappointing if it is supposed to be a Two Rivers long bow this looks pretty amazing. Can't wait.
SQUEEEEEEEE its happening its really happening. now one thing that made me twitch it was THREE not five... 2 of them were just tag-a-longs
Holy shit...I just gave a verbal hell yeah in JFK.  Hope TSA is a WOT fan otherwise this could be awkward.
Basically they said "light skin niggas only in this show" do better Hollywood do better than !!!!!
I'm a sucker for this type of fantasy
freekin awesome!
This looks amazing, this 360 is weird but okay I guess
I hope it turns out as good as the trailer looks! "The wheel weaves as the wheel wills"
Doesn't it look really bright and lowkey kinda terrible?
Old Cenn Buie's down the 'Winespring inn' again, and those crafty Coplins and Congars are acting like Taren Ferry folk! That's it! I'm getting the 'Womens circle' involved.
There are neither beginnings nor endings to the Wheel of Time. But it is a beginning.
Wow. Solid "no thanks".
It is time to toss the dice...
So what's the regular link to the trailer?  I tried watching it on The Dusty Wheel and they ruined my experience by not muting all of their random friends during the first showing.
The golden crane flies for tarmon gai'don
What the hell man, couldn’t figure out how to close this video.
Whats the point of this 360 video when you don't really see anything else when you look around!
😍😍
Ok first off, Fal Dara looks incredible.  Second of all it looks like the show is adding in parts of New Spring, with Moiraine using the oath rod and meeting Lan which is amazing. Third, MY BOY NARG GETTING HIS SCREEN TIME LETS GO.  Narg for Nae'blis.
Oh thank god they didn't gender swap anyone....
Old blood runs deep *chills*
Show looks great, this 360 video crap sucks
Let’s go!!!!!!!!!! 😎😁
Weaving does not look how I imagined it would. What happened to the complex patterns to create things. Not just what looks like manipulating wispy strands
Does anyone know if this show is for a teenage audience or an adult audience?
No, no, no, Moiraine! It's not one of "five" of you. It's one of THREE of you BOYS (Rand, Mat or Perrin). The two girls are out. You're an Aes Sedai and you can't lie.
That was one of the most amazing things I've ever seen in my life I am so excited for this I think Robert Jordan would be proud
_Dovie'andi se tovya sagain!_ It's time to roll the dice!
For those that read the books, is this accurate? As someone who hasn't it looks generic, so it may just be because I have no attachment to the material.
Til shade is gone Til water is gone Into the shadow with teeth bared Screaming defiance with the last breath To spit in sightblinder’s eye on the last day…
For me with Vivaldi in Linux in 1080p this Video is very choppy :(. With normal Videos, even in 4K-UHD, I have no problems.
its like they never read the books  One of the five of them ..dear god ..so much good stuff in the books they are going to screw it up .its  what hollywood does
Looks incredible.  The 3D trailer is amazing
Wow, that's some heavy compression on 1080p. I thought setting the video to my monitor's resolution would have been wise. The 4K looks a lot better even though I don't have a 4K monitor. It's not the pixels that's better, just overall better compression. Quality tip, don't watch this video with a setting below 4K!!
раз 30й пересматриваю))
Super hyped. Where is Nyneave? The genius wielder of the power.
Somehow, this looks like even scifi might of done a better job.
Mothers milk in a cup!
Looks way better than the teaser and clip they release earlier
Looks like a feminist LOTR rip-off
As one who has read the books, I am REALLY looking forward to this.  On a side note, I always pictured Karen Allen as Siuan Sanche. Let's hope they don't mess this up.
Come on Amazon, give us what we all want.  Lan saying "Sheepherder".
Ba'alzamon is to the right at 1:45!
Moiraine Sedai: "I swear not to use the one power as a weapon".  Also Moiraine Sedai: "Out of the way, Sheep herder, shit's about to get real....".
New Rockstars sent me!
Excited as hell for this show and love all the books.   Had to still give it a thumbs down because of this crap 360 VR stuff
good lord making this trailer a "360 experience"" was terrible idea lmao what are you thinking
Narnia meets Dungeons and Dragons.
AAAAAAAH I GOT GOOSE BUMPS! It’s gonna be a bumpy ride…..WOW!
looks amazing, so hyped for it!
One of the five of you…?
What's the point of doing a 360 if it's just going to be a "3D" screen projected in air. 🤷. Use the entire 360° to put is right in the middle of the trailer. 😂
I never heard of the books but they have to be better than this trailer would represent. Two minutes of innocuous special effects and breathy dialog.
I am being paranoid maybe, but please tell me they didn't go woke and change who the Dragon is. I would be devastated if they do that - and I don't think I would be the only one. My paranoia is because of one line in this trailer - those who know will get what I mean.
Did I just saw Moiraine crying and Lan scared? I have a bad feeling about this...
Shame to Amazon!
OMG
Burn me, but this gives me goosebumps.
Why does Moraine say one of the 5 of them will stop the Dark One when she knows it's one of the three boys? She wasn't even interested in Egwene or Nynaeve & didn't even want them to join the quest?  She went to Two Rivers to find a the boy who would be the Dragon Reborn.
I've seen this movie, they throw the ring in the lava at the end.
More like 180 degrees
Here because Chris Stuckmann sent me!  Sponsor him again Prime, would never have known about this if not for him!
this looks a li'l cheesy but really faithful to the novel and i love it. i think people might tear it to shreds because it really does look a little melodramatic, but the original novel is as well, but it's still got a lot of depth. so i have that hope for this
Great, epic books. Series looks kinda meh, mediocre. But hard to tell from a trailer.
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Hype hype hype
They made a movie or show about spice?
Good to see this has such passion in it! Was afraid it'll be a cashgrab.
Tai'Shar Manetheren, Tai'Shar Malkier, Tai'Shar RIgney.
Still not getting it. What's the big deal?
Так плохо, что даже не смешно. Подбор актёров просто провал. В целом выглядит как фентези сериалы из 90х.
Wow!!
Cool i can't wait
*OHMYFUCKINGGODIWANTTOWATCHTHISSOBADJESUSFUCKINGCHRISTPLEASELETMEHAVETHIS*....*clears throat*.....So, I have to say I'm looking forward for this TV series.
Moraine: I swear...to never to use the one power as a weapon. Very next scene: Moiraine uses the one power as a weapon.
This looks terrible
New Rockstars sent me! Movie looks good.
YAWN
WOW :DD
Woohoo!
You better watch out the Woke TV show has begun.🤣
Let the Lord of Chaos Rule 😈😈😈😈
Is this the sequel to the live-action Beauty and the Beast?
Listen!!!! This is gonna be amazing! 3 more weeks!
Upload a normal video. Youtube is having a seisure
Hype
"Dem Rimz of Time"
We better see some braid tugging!
Use the 360 feature to see the words "modero daghain pas duente cuebiyar" appear at the end
Can't wait!!!
1 of 5?
Exciting Times!
Dragon is reborn My heart holds no fear for death
I’m hopeful but still scared they are gonna mess it up
I'm not keen on the Dragon Reborn mystery being expanded. One of those characters is several years older than the rest (and often thinks about how they looked after the others as children) and that plays a large part of their development (coming to terms with being the equal of the others, not an older sibling/authority figure, and this is a big reason why they butt heads with at least one other in the group). For them to be a DR candidate means they have to be the same age, and that takes that away completely...
Looking at the cast list for Season 1, I see none of the Forsaken....so they take their time telling the story. Unfortunately, apart from Moraine I don't really like the actors they cast for the core characters. Rand is described as very tall - 6'6" or 198 cm in height. He has blue-gray eyes and dark hair with a "reddish tinge". Josha Stradowski doesn't look a lot like that. Perrin....well, that's a "diversity cast" anyhow. Barney Harris doesn't really have the roguish charisma needed for the Matrim role. Madeleine Madden simply lacks the looks for Egwene. Zoë Robins looks nothing like the Nynaeve in the books and lacks her "gravitas".
What's the point of the 360?
I honestly was just meh about the 1st trailer but this one is great. Can't wait to see this
1:45 - is that The Professor???
OH BOY!!!  LOOKS GOOD!!
I love you Amazon Prime Video for bringing this to us. May you always find water and shade.
Wow so... skipping right to the last book there, eh?
Efsane
Lots of race swapping going on in this series.  I hope we see some protests at Amazon and walk outs
Fear of death holds not my heart!
I can definitely see how people will mistake Moiraine as the main character.
Is it correct to say "Swear your Oath, Moiraine Sedai"? Technically, she is not an Aes Sedai before she is bonded by the Oaths...
OMG that sorround spatial audio 360° 4k 100fps my goodness I like it a lot nice work youtube
I've been waiting for this for AGES. I had lost hope when I saw the terrible Pilot from the old copyright owner for a serie. But this one is FIRE!!! I AM SO HYPED
Beautiful cast! Also hoped it will be more scenic..  unfortunately 90% shots are face or torso close up.  Maybe all scenery Amazon has saved for LOTR series)
OMG..... I am starting to believe this will going to be a dream come true. I  starting to believe this will be a awesome adaptation and journey for all of us..... Thank you
Wow! Just wow! The first high fantasy that isn’t just teenage drama rebadged…that I know of :-) And those Aiel…!
IGN have a normal better quality version of this trailer up for anyone wondering.
I mean it is kinda impressive when you think about it.  Its not easy making an adaptation like this.  And consistently get almost every single detail wrong.
OH MY GOD.  MY SKIN IS COVERED IN GOOSEBUMPS!
Hype!
Wow, just wow, can’t wait
Oh no! The wheel of time might crush me. My thoughts are very profound. I have to save that lasy.
Commenting a complete list of hidden background secrets: On the floor is the old Aes Sedai symbol  Saidar is white and flowing on the left.

at 49s the text "Shaider Aan" pops up if your rotate the video into the blackness
"It's one of the five of you..." Well, there goes a large part of the story.
"Mordero daghain pas duente cuebiyar" "Fear of death holds not my heart" Tai'shar Manetheren!!
I think this trailer is a lot better overall then the first one. Music sounds more unique and visuals are looking better. The only thing that upsets me slightly is Moiraine thinking that the dragon reborn is one of the 5 Emond fielders when it should only be one of the 3 boys as the dragon reborn is male.
360 которые мы заслужили
1:03 WHAT ARE THOSE!!
Lewis Therin Telamon returns.
This is THE fantasy serie!!
1:46 on Saidin. The dark one stirs
So sick. This is what we’ve been waiting for
😍😍
😍😍🔥
🥰🥰😍
😍🔥
This would only be cool if you were inside the trailer and able to look around while it was going on.  Otherwise  seeing a theater like sides Just makes this hard to watch and not really worth it.  I want to be able to watch without having to tilt my phone in just the right angle to see the entire pic.
😍😍🔥
🥰😍

Blood and ashes, this looks good

Myrdrall at 0:45
On the ground is the old aes sedai symbol. To the right is black saidin flowing and to the left saidar is flowing white.  Behind you they mix together forming the aes sedai old symbol.
Excited....but "1 of you 5"? The Dragon is male, it would destroy the story if the Dragon was female because the taint on Saidin wouldn't matter. Please don't pull some woke bullshit on this, it will tank the show.
..pas duente cuebiyar, Mordero daghain. Look to the left and right at 2:50
1:48 . Look to the right and you can see Baalzamon with the fire in his eyes.
At 1:38 look to the right to see a myrdrall face and then a trollocs screaming face from the shadows.
I think you can see Loial at 1:35 , he looks kind of short.
I'm excited for this even though I stopped reading the books since "The Crown of Swords".   During the time, it was just too many characters and events to keep track of, and I was waiting for years for each book to get published 😓
OMG this look really bad... definitely a flop
I am excited about this new show. The books are excellent hope it becomes my new GOT replacement
Why is it in 360° though. Why not just upload a normal trailer first.
I cannot wait for thissssss !!!!
Poor Thom.
For anyone trying to figure out what the words mean in the 360 version, it’s a battle cry in the Old Tongue, in Manetheren. “Carai an Ellisande! Al Ellisande! Mordero daghain pas duente cuebiyar! Al Ellisande!”   Which translates: “For the Honor of the Rose of the Sun! The Rose of the Sun! Fear of death holds not my heart! The Rose of the Sun!”
THE WHEEL FINNA WEAVE!!!!
The CGI looks incomplete.
So initial observations.   Gut reaction, this looks very well done. The costumes, the sets, the cast - looking forward to it.   Concerns - we BARELY see Rand and he is the main character from the books. Why so little focus on him? Moraine says one of the "five of you" will save the world. What? No. She was hunting for the Dragon Reborn who would save the world and it was not one of the women.   Why is Tom Merilynn a super young guy?   Where is Loial?  Anyway, I just finished listening the first book on Audible and am into the second one. Not a die hard fan so I'm sure much more seasoned readers will have different thoughts. Honestly felt like the first book was a mishmash of a bunch of different stories (so much copycat of the Lord of the Rings), but it was still fun.
Really hope Amason doesnt mess this up. The story deserves the best.
Blood and bloody ashes!
There is a lot of jumping around in time to give context to various plot points - I don't recall all of the linear order so will just include the info as part of the synopsis Opening title card explaining the Deviants and Eternals - the Deviants were created by the Celestials to hunt predators that prey on intelligent life on newly evolving worlds, but then they started to hunt the life as well, so Ceestials created the Eternals to kill the Deviants. Opens 5000 years ago in Mesopotamia a man is fishing on some rocks with his son (?) and is attacked by a Deviant from the ocean. The Eternals show up and a short battle commences, after which they line up in a triangular "hero" pose and this rolls into the Marvel logo opening. Jumps to present day - Sersi and Dane Whitman are teachers in the UK and dating. During a class lesson, a large earthquake strikes, and Sersi saves a child from a falling object by turning it to sand. Later while out on a date, a Deviant attacks Sersi, Sprite, and Dane; during the battle Ikaris shows up and they fight it off after noting that they thought all the Deviants were destroyed and unlike others, the Deviant was able to heal its wounds. The group decide to visit Ajak as she was the leader of the group. After arriving at the midwest ranch where she is now living, they discover her dead body, A small golden device leaves Ajak's body and enters Sersi ( this is how she communicated with the Celestials) - they then decide to round up the rest of the Eternals to deal with the Deviants. Thena and Gilgamesh are in Australia (I think) due to an issue with her memory causing her to randomly attack the other Eternals. Gilgamesh is obviously in love with Thena but it is not played as a romantic relationship. Phastos and his husband live with their child and he decides to help due to the fact that he has fully embraced the human race and wants to protect his family. Makkari has been living in the Eternals ship all this time (I guess, since there is a bunch of food containers and mess strewn about. Kingo is a Bollywood actor ( there is a short dance routine that introduces this) and comes with the group along with his valet (don't recall the name) who tries to document everything on video. Druig is living in some rainforest controlling a small village of people after losing faith in humanity and wanting to control them to stop war, famine, etc. Gilgamesh is killed fighting the Deviants in the forest. Sersi learns that the Celestials created both races and that the Eternals are basically just very advanced robots. They seed young planets with a Celestial "egg" that takes eons to mature. The evolving intelligent life on these planets feeds the Celestial's growth, so the Eternals are sent to protect the evolving life forms and kill the Deviants. After the emergence, the Eternals are " rebooted" and sent to another world (this is the cause of Thena's memory issue, as she knows that the planet is doomed) - this cycle has gone on for millions of years. Earth was seeded and Tiamut is about to emerge (this was the cause of the earthquake earlier). Once awakened, the entire planet and all life will be destroyed. They debate on what to do and some decide to try and find a way to stop the emergence. Ikaris disagrees, Sprite and Kingo are on his side but Kingo agrees to help. Phastos designs a device (Uni-Mind) that will allow Druig to channel all the Eternals energies in the hope of controlling Tiamut and putting him back to sleep. Sersi learns that Ikaris knew about the Celestials actual plans and this is why he left the group hundreds of years ago. He killed Ajak because she had decided to help stop the emergence and save Earth. The group go to where Tiamut is and attempt to use the device - Ikaris and Sprite attempt to stop them. Sersi then uses the device to amplify her power and turn Tiamut to marble just as his hand and part of his head is emerging from the Indian Ocean. Ikaris flies off into space (towards the sun - unclear if he just left or flew into the sun and killed himself), then Sersi makes Sprite a real human with what remains of her power. A few days (?) later Thena, Makkari, and Druig leave in the ship to seek out other Eternals and try and stop the cycle of destruction. Sersi, Kingo, and Phastos stay on Earth but are then pulled into space by Arishem and vanish. The two end credit stingers: 1) Dane is looking at an old box and pulls out a sword that is wrapped up. Just as he is about to touch it, an off screen voice stops him. 2) On the Eternals' ship, Pip the Troll appears and introduces Starfox
OMG! It looks so cool.   The Taint, Draghkar coming, Members Nynaeve's braids etc.   BTW, why was Egwene burning at the stake? I don't remember that part in EoTW..
SO excited!!! looks like it'll be good too!!
So excited for this think I just peed a little bit
Finally it's been confirmed what I've been saying for so long. That there considering All five of them to be possible Dragon Reborn which is weird because Nynaeve is older than them. But I'm still curious about it..
Rosamund Pikeeeee frrrrrr she is amazing i cant wait to see her in a fantasy show
This looks great so far. I cannot wait for the 19th.
Never to use the One Power as a weapon except against shadowspawn
Give me your trust, said the Aes Sedai, for on my shoulders I support the sky.
I can't wait to see al'Lan Mandragoran in action!! ❣️
This is a hot mess. The trailer would have been utterly epic if they'd just made a trailer and put that 360 budget somewhere else.
This is blowing my mind. So many years of imagining this world out of the pages in a book to see it recreated so masterfully. Watching this trailer was a special moment for me.
Uh, do you have a not 360⁰ option? I'm feeling queasy.
Where's the regular trailer, what on earth is this silly "360" mess
I sure hope this is better than Game of Thrones, which was a ton of fun build up with a meagre delivery in the end.
Mano do céu! I can't wait
That whitecloak with the rings... Wow
"modero daghain pas fuente cuebiyar" - "Fear of death holds not my heart"
Amazon, you really need to, if you can, turn the 360 thing off this video (and remove it from the title) and fix the quality up to 1080p, else the views on this trailer will seriously suffer.
this is fantastic, such hidden gems in the 360 view
My body is ready!! Come on November!!
This looks so very, very bad.  Well to those who want this I hope you enjoy it but me I'm just going to re-read the books again and this time it's finished so no waiting of the the finale book while you will get 3 seasons at best then have it cancelled on a cliff hanger lol.
Please release normal trailer 360 don't look good
I need to go and finish the first book now, the trailer looks amazing.
1:46 Wait what professor?😂🔥
It's the 3 of them, not 5.  wtf?  pandering at it's finest.
Why make this 360° if there's nothing interesting to look around at?
This looks incredible! I'm so hyped!!
Suprise not many views. Wheel of time books are popular
What kind of a limp Lan is that
Nice bait
Whoah
Sobbing in joy.  Seeing these characters FINALLY on-screen after decades, is emotionally overwhelming.
What exactly was the point of making this a 360 video. Couldn't see the whole main trailer, and it was low res. All the extras around didn't really add anything
Meh looks like another cringy teen show. RIP
tam looking like an absolute badass unsheathing his sword.
Wooowww
Idk, it just seems really weird to me that Rand acts like the side character in all these trailers. Morraine is great, but it’s really bizarre
When the Dragon is Reborn he will break all oaths, shatter all ties.
It seems to be crazy woke and the directing look like everything we already saw.
Aaaaaahhhhhhhh!!!
If you’re going to make it a 360 experience at least do more with the 360 experience. Most of the time nothing was happening and the few moments something did happen felt like a 1996 CPU game
What’s the point of a 360° video when it’s not really 360°???
A shame they used the Who Wants To be a Millionaire theme tune....🤷‍♂️
Where is her staff? and where is her Jewel on the forehead?
Waiting patiently!
Anyone disliking this is a Darkfriend.
I know the book readers are pumped for this, but how have your non- WOT friends responded ? Most of mine have no clue..
So diverse it looks like α Βenetton commercial
Can't i just see with normal screen view
It's getting closer \o/
Aes sedai, None hold heart, death fear
Where is the non-3d trailer!  The gimmick doesn't add anything and just makes this impossible to view properly
'Lorne Balfe" the composer makes different feel on "Wheel of Time"" outstanding bgm score🔥🔥
Aiel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Lets GO!!!!!
Can we have the normal version? What the hell is this
How can I turn the 3d thing off?
Can definitely do without the 360 BS
Why is this a 360 trailer if there's literally nothing on the sides it's just annoying trying to watch. Or am I just too old?
70 darkfriends disliked the video
The hype is now real!
Hearing Moiraine say “The Wheel weaves as the wheel wills” out loud 😍😍 all the chills. Cannot wait.
its so beautiful i cried lololol lets goooo
Interesting, looks like they're starting with New Spring content.
Tam v Trolloc looks amazing from the 1 second shown.
Turn the picture with your mouse whenever it says 'The Dark One.'
I'm so happy.
I really hope the actors do a good job because lookwise I am disappointed
The Old Blood Runs Deep in the Two Rivers Indeed...   My favorite books brought to life, it's like seeing  the Marvel and DC universe come to life but with magic and fantasy at it's heart. Thank you Prime for making Dreams come to life. Can't wait !! Gimme Preview showing! I know you can Beeewzooooz!!
Sobbing again. I'm blown away. Thank you all for bringing my favourite series to life so beautifully. 20 years I've been waiting for this!!!
Wheel of Time trailer good... AR function bad.
Man, i got dizzy
an aiel at 1:49
Love it
Watch this trailer on IGN (non 360 one)
WHAT IS HAPPENING?! That 360 view is terrifying and awesome :O :O :O
I think the fandom should be very grateful.  This trailer delivers greater promise than most other fantasy series have ever even been considered for.  Very much looking forward to Rafe's vision of this journey
I will watch.
LET"S GO!!!!!!!!!!
Bloody amazing... can't wait
this looks like utter shite
I don't remember any of the characters coming across a 200" flatscreen TV while travelling the Ways in the books
why the hell isnt this trailer on the indian Prime video????????
Amazing!
I couldn't finish the books... Made it through book nine... and haven't returned since..
Could have been in 2d and been the exact same thing
Oh so by 360° you mean me sitting in a cave watching the actual trailer on a screen.
Reminds me of Game of Thrones, so I’m gonna check this out since I have Amazon Prime. Looks good! 👍🏼
What an stupid experience!!!
so WHO else was @ 1:46 and said (while probably pointing at te screen) "The Professor!!!"
Gives me chills! WOW!
Puhh i miss some charakters, i hope they don´t cut Min and Loial out from the story :/
Why? Amazon why!!! What a ridiculous way to release a trailer!
OK, I'm cool with a 360 video... if the footage is 360. Why have a 2D video suspended in 3D?
YES! MOAR!
This 360 view is uncomfortable. Innovative, but uncomfortable. 😂
The casting choices will probably be the death of this show, but we will see...
I'm still reading The Eye of The World for the first time, and I am loving it so far! I can't wait for this!
Warhammer - Beastmen
One of the 5 of you???
ok but like....  why?
I read all of the books but tbh I did not thing that there will be a movie based on them. Good thing there will be.
Can I just get the actual trailer without this 360 bullshit?
Dislike because this 3d trailer thing is fucking stupid
This trailer looks amazing
This looks so amazing!!!!
1:23 Who's that?
another bad fantasy
The 360° wasn't it...
The wheel weaves as the wheel wills…mmmm I got a feeling I’m going to love this show!
HELL YEA
It's pretty cool with all the words popping up in the back ground areas of the 3d space.
1:49 Look to the right of the screen for an Easter egg.
Maximum Hype
Please be good please be good please be good please be good
Everyone getting all upset at the 360° trailer should just go to the WoT Twitter.
omg omg omg omg. I keep pinching myself....this is actually happening?!  "The wheel weaves what the wheel wills."  CHILLS
Is it me- or are those NOT the three oaths?
This plot is in Baltimore, right?
David Benioff and D.B. Weiss are about to be put in their place. :O
Letsss gooooo
Why does this looks so bad? So cheap? Jesus....
Can't wait!!!
On one hand I am glad to see some diversity. On the other hand I was under the impression Egwene and Nynaeve had dark hair and eyes, but not naturally dark skin. There's even a scene in the books where Egwene had become so sun darkened (tanned) she looked like a dark hair Aiel (which would match Rand's skin tone)
the golden crane rides for tarmon gai'don
Is this meant to be at 12 FPS?
Looks terrific to me. Can't wait!
Amazing trailer, hate the set up. Please don't ever do it again.
1:46  The Professor ??  :D
It's impossible to enjoy this trailer. My options are a blurry picture or constant frame skipping. The picture is not even 360. This vision has nothing positive to offer. Please fire the person responsible for this idea and upload a decent copy.
Well it is 360° no doubt
this sounds like all the other series and movies about “the dark one” is coming. whats special about it that makes it standout from the rest?
I've waited for this show for over a decade.  Beyond hyped.  Also on the bonds, a key phrase that was left off is "I will not user the one power as a weapon, except in self defense or in defense of my warder"  Basically prevents aggression with the One Power.
The Wheel of Time  turns, and Ages come  and pass,  leaving memories that become  legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one Age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an  Age long past, a wind rose in the Mountains of Mist. The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was a beginning.
Nice trailer, really hate the 3d thing though, its implementation just means that the rest of the video is choppy on any of the HD settings
Adding in all the stuff away from the screen was just awesome.  I especially liked Ba'alzamon showing up.
3rd age is coming.
Wow 😳
This is the first "proper" trailer in my opinion, where we get to see some action and hear some dialogue. Just a pity it's in 360° where you have to slap it on 8k to see good quality.. takes forever to load on a crappy internet connection!
"Mordero daghain pas duente cuebiyar!"
Incredible! Trollocs look absolutely insane!
Can. Not. Wait!
!!!!!
360 Experience didn't work here. Although the trailer was good.
LETS GOOOO THIS LOOKS INCREDIBLE
1:48 Right side in the black! These Eyes!!!
I have won again Lews Therin
"and never use the One Power as a weapon"??
Lets go
Que venha logo doce e tenebroso novembro
LET THE DRAGON ONCE AGAIN RIDE ON THE WINDS OF TIME! 🌩
Omg did the Whitecloaks burn an Aes Sedai?? And the Aiel!! So hyped for this!
Goodness me... I think I'm ready for it.
I'm actually sobbing rn I'm so happy
It's wonderful
Everyone's saying they see loial in one little scene but i've been playing this over and over again and can't find him
And in this new age, a wind blew across the YouTube Like button...
Are you guys just lost your mind??? The ancient Aes Sedai symbol behind me??? I’m freaking out!!!! So genius!
Bold of you to call it an experience since it has ruined the trailer for me
Tai'shar!
Looks great. But the video quality is poor; I think probably because of the 360 degree thing (and even when selecting 1080p). I think Amazon should release another non-360 version of the trailer to ensure there's a high quality version.
Soooooo fucking goood
You have earned much jie.
Light... bloody Light...
The Aes Sedai being burnt is really dark though. I was disturbed by it.(But it's good for the show I guess)
The Wheel weaves as The Wheel wills.
That Saidin effect looks epic, already can't wait for Dumai Wells
Ok if this doesnt turn out as awesome as the trailers promise im coming to amazon with pitchforks and torches who with me 🤣
Mordero daghain
Brother we want stable version
hype
This was exactly what I was hoping for. A gimmicky little low resolution version of trailer inside a little cave. You should all be very proud.
It somehow reminds me of Lord of the Rings
The wheel weaves as the wheel wills
Ve üzerinde hiçbir şeyin yetişmediği topraklara kan yağdığı zaman Ejderin Çocukları filizlendi, ölümle dans etmek üzere silahlanmış Ejderin Halkı. Ve  onları kıraç topraklardan çağırdı ve onlar savaşla dünyayı sarstılar.
This has me super excited!!!
I’ve fed all my doubts into the Flame and the Void. All that remains is unadulterated excitement! 😭
What is 360• ? Do one need a ter’angreal to see this properly ?
Mordero daghain pas duente cuebiyar! (Fear of death holds not my heart!)   VS.      Shaidar Haran
This makes me so much happier day by day that it's coming and that I get to brag about getting my name used in the books by Sanderson!   Let the Lord of Chaos rule!
Use the camera controls to pan around this 360 video and you can see glowing red eyes, trolloc faces, words in the Old Tongue, and weaves from both saidin and saidar. Amazing!
This is not a good encode for regular viewing. Very blurry and blocky after the unwrapping. Hope there's a separate standard format trailer coming.
Where is the non 360 version. Makes it hard to watch on a device.
How do I disable the useless 360 feature, it's making the trailer unwatchable?
We have been waiting for the Wheel to weave as the wheel wills for quite a long time now and we cannot wait its almost here!!!!!! The hype is real <3
Moiraine's voice is epic!!!
So, it looks like its both Eye of the world AND great Hunt, this could be interesting.
at 1:46 you can see Ba'alzamon if you turn the video to the right.
It's surreal to see these books that were so important throughout my adolescence brought to life...hard to describe the feelings.  So thankful for this show :)
Well now I'm going to have nightmares about Machin Shin. The 360 was a cool detail.
Mat: You've fully lost your mind.  Me: Yes, I have. SOOOOO excited.  Also, the 360 experience is INSANE. (Drag the video around if you don't know what that means :)
The face with the eyes of fire in the darkness towards the end of the trailer 😱
Please provide a 2d
What is this 3D crap. Give me the proper trailer please
Give us the regular trailer please.
Death is lighter than a feather. Duty is heavier than a mountain.
Love the trailer, hate watching this on my phone with the 3D nonsense, and it makes me not want to share it. Can we get a normal version?
The producers certainly gives the fans treats almost everyday now!  I love this and I'm so gonna disecct every frame of it! 😄
Is there a non 360 version available?
sign me up
Time to roll the dice!
0:14 Turn to Saidar it says Aes Sedai.
This experience is🔥🔥
Wow that looks very interesting.. can't wait 😲
How can I watch it normally and not VR?!?
holy crap.....  this looks like they may have actually done it properly. let's gooooooo.... so pumped for this.
wow, love this
Tai'shar Manetheren!
This makes me so happy and excited i just can't even express it! Amazing work!
Tai'shar Manetheren! Tai'shar Malkier! Let the Dragon ride again, on the winds of time~   24 more days!
The main cast look so goooooood
Oh ya!!
Tai'shar manetheren
Where is Loyal!!!!
Going to be epic!!!! Love RJ and the world he made.
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS <3
sheep swallop and bloody buttered onions!
How do you turn the 360 off ?
i'm so ridiculously excited!!
Dragonsworn assemble!!!!
THIS LOOKS AMAZING!!!!!
Why is this so blurry on all my devices?
Aww man..why is it 360?..I just want to watch the trailer,can it be switched off?
Tai'shar Manetheren!
Absolutely flaming brilliant
“The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again.”
Regular trailer please
Awesome!  😨😎👍
Where is the normal trailer for the love of the creator. What is this nonsense.
Meh.
Seriously can I just watch the trailer without this 360 bullshit?
YES
Tai'shar Manetheren!
I dont like the 360
Yes! Awesome work!
Blood and bloody ashes! YESSSSS!
Yessssss
hyyyyyppppe
91 million budget🔥🤐
Is there a way to turn off 360?
Is there a normal version of this trailer instead of this stupid 360 video?
I kinda liked the teaser trailer more 😭
Tamil trailer when?
Let the Dragon ride again on the winds of time.
Let the Dragon ride again on the winds of time!
Insane!
Sooo excited!!!!!
Thank you PrimeVideo!
1:20 Fire Lord Ozai?
"It's one of the five of you" okay, okay, interesting.. I'm here for it
Yesterday is history """ """ tomorrow is mystery """ """ today is gift """ """ that's why it's called present ""🌹🌹
360 view is stupid!
"Congratulations To Everyone who comes in every single second"🌺💕❤
Can we get regular trailer please 🙏
The old blood sings
Where my fellow wolfbrothers at? 🐺
It's like we are watching in a movie theater 😮👌
Let the dragon ride again on the winds of time!
I can only like it once! :(
I'm all for diversity but in projects like this, it just comes across and inauthentic.. instead of following the story i'm just thinking about the diversity.
Give us a normal video, not this botched 360 travesty
I get the vibes of Legend of the seeker. Pretty sure its gonna be awesome.
The black guy that was drinking wine was such a vibe
Madonna ho avuto una specie di erezione a vedere il trailer. Aspetta che mi fermo un attimo. Ma che oooh
Their are no beginings and endings to the wheel of time, But this is A beginning
I just finished the first book and it seems season 1 isn’t just doing the first book 👀
I can't wait.
That’s koo
Yes, yes, yes!
Wow ! This feels special !
It's gonna higher then Game of Thrones
Well I'm somehow more excited than i was.
wow 360
the wheel is turning!!! lets go!! =)))
Can we get a regular video???
Yeahhhhhh let's goooooo
