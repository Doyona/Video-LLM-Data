Spider man brand new day
Sorry but tobey maguire is the best Spiderman ever , also andrew garfield is great actor but the real spider will be tobi after him andrew but tom i don't think its fit him
I love seeing this again 3 years later on the coast of Spiderman4 and knowing ghat Andrew and Tobey were on it makes this really funny. And just knowing all that has happened, like A LOT Toms new movie- broadway career, Engagement! ❤❤
Benedict is on a roll with his jokes

6:33
2024 gang?👇
Doctor Strange is SUCH a grump
Bruh why is Tom spoilering the hole time
“I wanna know for them” “it’s not all about me, ya know” well said Kimmel, trying to speak for us true fans 💛
Lizard getting punched by invisible Andrew is STILL so funny.
watching this interview after already watching the movie is so funny cuz you just watch them all lie about andrew and toby being in the movie
Andrew Garfield Spider-Man and Tobey Maguire Spiderman and Tom Holland spider man
7:12 He did spoiled. He said "yeah"
The Doctor Strange disappear now
his friends of Tom Holland are his high school friends in spider man
Tom Holland is the newest Spider-Man
Who’s Here After The Rerelease Of All The Spidey Films
7:05 ahaha that was hilarious
O unico penta é o brasilsão.
1:23 benedict sounded like HE might be one of the villains. classic villain laugh bwahahahaha
Wow, "they guy in the chair" character looks so weird with no hair at all.
you can tell how stressed out they all were not to give anything away. It must be so hard to not give away tobey and andrew (even though it was pretty obvious they'd be in the film)
How did he know kraven the hunter was in works in marvel
BRAZIL MENTIONED!!!! LESGOOOOO
😂😂all of them are terrible liars 🤣🤣 Sometimes i feel like even jimmy kimmel knew the truth way long (you know..like they told him the truth behind the scenes or something) ..but after it wasn"t a secret..imean rumours about all of   spider men's reuninon was too much to be ignored
Tom’s suit is really pretty!
The scooby doo was my favorite line😂😂😂
1:24 - I love Ben’s laugh 😂
Feeling the same called for change the topic sorry if I've become worst I'm a normal person who have riding a ghost inside of my own body 8:43
All sports news channel seems for fight TV
The unnecessary censored of Doctor Strange’s Scooby-Doo reference made it even more hilarious.
6:36 Jimmy does know how to change the topic 😂😂
4:10 Jimmy is being honest 😂😂😂
1:49 Zendaya missed the easter egg 🥚
Take me back pleaseee. I wish I got to see this opening night in cinemas. I should have, but I got covid and missed it
Little Tobey should play a character called Mighty Mite.
" you know there's going to be a capital style insurrection if they're not in this movie, right." 😂😂😂😂😂
It's so hilarious to watch this today
211,588
With being in a superhero movie, comes great contractual liability. 😅
well.... what shall I say...
This is one of those movies I wish I could watch again for the first time
we misses Ironman 😢
With super hero movies come Contractual liability 😂🙌🏻
It's like the big brother who is always babysitting his younger siblings!! In all seriousness though, this movie was by far the best part of Phase 4!
I love how Jimmy just like uses tom to spoil 😄
i didnt notice Tom holland has full high heels
Jacobs laugh is so funny and cute 🤣 6:39
4:36
The comedic timing in this interview is so funny 😂
There was no insurrection and the fbi has said so. They were simply upset over four years of lies and false charges on DT like collusion, quid pro, fake rapes on Kavanaugh, the blocking of the hunter situation on social media during a crucial time, and the demonizing and doxxing of minors like Sandmann and Rittenhouse and much much more. The left elite are not your friends. They play these sick, twisted games for power. Very few things in life are more evil than a fake good. For your own sake don't let them dupe you or use you. Finally, be wise and observant on your own. Take care.
well its almost a year ago now, tobey and andrew were in the movie... what a time
Gollans ar Goll.
Villans ar Vans.
Just imagine Jimmy Kimmel as Kraven, what a universe this would be
i love Zendaya's toilet paper fancy suit
Scaffold the incredible Pole.
Aêêê Brazil ! Brasil é top memes for world !!!
I've rewatched the movie in theatre yesterday, the more fun stuff version, and I loved it! Seeing more of the three Peters felt like a blessing, I could watch a TV show only about them hanging out together and I'd never get tired of it! So now I'm rewatching some interviews with the cast (especially with Tom, Andrew and Tobey cause I already miss them) and this one was on my list because it's so hilarious! Benedict is having the time of his life, his laughs confirm that he knows more than he can tell and enjoys seeing Tom managing not to spoil everything despite Jimmy's provocations... Golden interview
I saw this movie this morning at Kcc cinema here at gensan.... it was nice and spectacular.... Tom....toby ..Andrew..
so, Tobey and Andrew appears in the movie?
Cumberbatch is like do not mess this up Tom
The main cast trying so hard to hide Toby and Andrew from the movie.
I love watching Benedict watching Tom talk…waiting to tackle him if he starts to give away too much, as he’s prone to do 😂
Did I miss something or did Michael Keaton as The Vulture never get mentioned?
This film is peak MCU. Feeling a little fatigue, but it's great to have some lasting power with all three Spider-Men we love.  The ending of the best part of our childhood. To me as far as I'm concerned, this is the definitive end of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the "Spider-Man" installments, let alone the "Spider-Verse" animated films.
I normally strongly dislike Jimmy Kimmel, but he actually did good this time.
My first time hearing Tom Holland's thick accent. 😏
6:44 is just Tom nervously looking at Benedict for support and approval on the topic of the SpiderMen and everyone else just laughing nervously and praying Tom doesn't spoil anything. Prove me wrong.
Jacob should have his own movie
6:43 I like that Tom has o look to Benedict just as if h is saying I don’t a to spoil it, they have tapped us, and Benedict just looks scared back down a him while everyone states a Tom
Jimmy: Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, go ahead. no one: Tom: Who were they?
4G
promoting no way home is a difficult task for the whole team specially for tom🤣
6:35
This interview was so funny when it came out I watch it daily
Jesus saves✝️❤️
benedict is so red, red like a tomato, a sitting tomato.
I love how clueless their acting
I love how throughout the whole interview Jimmy is trying to get spoilers out of Tom 😭
tom holland when he is in another fight- I thought I was brave mummm but im scared XDXDXD
benedict's just sitting there, letting the kids talk, and looking so good like a dilf he is
When Tom speaks  Everyone's life flashes before their eyes
If you watch the actual movie you will see Andrew kicked the lizard
We all know why we're back here
The actor who plays ned when his head is bald his head looks like an egg
The memories were hitting when tobey said: “try to do better”
Whenever you say the words "With great power ..." you die. Never say that to Peter.
Its funny that they had Willem Dafoe in "no way home" but not James Franco
Good job Tom on keeping the secret about the Spider-Mans. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
You can see Benedict stressing soo much hoping Tom won’t say anything 😂
That ned reaction will apply those friend laughing at serious situation memes !
I used to be Kraven the Hunter, but then I became a landlord.
Jimmy is good being Kraven the hunter
0:05 Maybe it was setup for Ned to do magics and is connected in the future of MCU. Here in the Philippines, it is believed that magic stuffs are being inherited and passed from generation to generation.
Damn it Jimmy! Matt Damon should've arrived tie him to chair and tape his mouth shut again.
people saw the big secrets a mile away
I wish Stan lee seeing this masterpiece
Gonna Cry
Alan Turing just came up from death in second or two😂😂
Honestly jimmy would be a good kraven
It's a bit weird hearing Tom speak in a British accent.
حشرههه😭😭😭😭
Tobby when are u gonna make Spider man 4 Movie?? i miss you so much
Tom almost cried because of jimmy 🤣
HUGE SPOILEEERRRSS  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  _  _ _ _ Oh hi!! May dies :)
They need to cast Matt Damon as Kraven just to piss Jimmy of :)
"With being in a superhero film comes with great contractual liability." XD
I love them 3000😭❤
Tom was too much under pressure not spoiling anything.  Tensed and stressed face first time seen like this.
That silent reaction though 😂😜
Omg I sometimes I forget that Tom Holland is British 😂😂😂

Thats the funniest video.. tryin to hide the other spiderman yet someone really noticed the lizard 😆😆
Benedict cumberbatch is saving this interview so hard, by not takin the rumours seriously 🤣🤣
Jacob is funny omg......🤣🤣🤣
6:40 doctor strange was about to send jimmy to grand canyon
Just watched today. It's nostalgia. This made me realize how old am I. Honestly, I've never thought that those three Spider-Mans would be together in one movie. Thanks MCU!
Benedict is gold. Not just as Strange, but we all know he's there to keep Tom from giving it all away. You can see he has way to much fun with it 😂
Grandma are cookies ready? Grandma : 07:35
I'm barely realizing that Tom Holland accidentally said yes when Jimmy Kimmel said Tobey Maguire 6:35
why is nobody talking about yhe daredevil cameo though 👀
i love how Jacob laughs all the time it's  so funny haha
Can you imagine doc oc saying “I’ll see you in a bit darling”
6:35
Benedict was paying close attention to each word coming out of Tom's mouth he was ready to jump at any moment.
4:30 hahahaha did i see worry in Sir Benedict's face 😂😂
Coming back to this remembering how everyone was bad liars for the movie
6:37 you’re welcome.
This was rated the worst ever movie on rotten eggs!
The lizard gets punched by?  Tom: 👁 👄 👁
2:47
2:46
2:20
2:19 Really??
I love Tom doing Alfred's accent relating their conversations, just the subtle shift from Surrey to slightly rougher London (and the fact he apparently called him darling)
hello
6:35
This movie has turned the table over the biggest movies of the century
00:27 Look I'm not one for ironing in my daily life, but wtf? And the lighting that just catches it 😩
I watched this movie 2 days ago, and I have got to say it was an absolutely amazing experience! If you haven't seen this movie yet, see it in the theaters while you still can!
I enjoyed the movie and was so glad to see Tobey! But Tom Holland is also a great Spiderman! I never watched the Andrew Garfield movies.
7:12 "You know there's going to be a (U.S.) Capital-style insurrection if they're not in this movie, right?"
Now, TOBEY MAGUIRE's Spider-Man (2002) is the very first MCU movie now.
the way people trying to pry spoilers out of tom is yas
There was no way Sue Storm, or INVISIBLE GIRL of the Fantastic Four would have a relevant role for NWH
jacob batalon struggling hard to become the main character here
WAIT !! Is anyone sad this is tom' last spiderman movie
Jacobs laugh is too contagious
Was that Jimmy kimmel as kraven the hunter?
“With being in a superhero film comes great contractual liability”
I just saw the movie and I admit, it's the best Marvel movie so far We all missed Andrew and Toby Bringing them like that, and the rest of the cast was just amazing It brought back the good all memories Thank you Marvel ,you never cease to impress ❤️😍
Tom's nervous face when Kimmel mentions Tobey n Andrew😳🥰
7:49 when the line quoted by Jimmy Kimmel. and Zendaya was like "did he know already???" 😧😨☺️😁.
aww i love jacobs laugh sm
I enjoyed a lot 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It's extremely hilarious
Now i'm Just pictureing alfred flying  around the set and its so funny😭😭
Who’s the bald Hawaiian dude at the back?
You know I wish Andrew And Tobey were here
BEST movie. These interviews were awesome
Introducing Andrew and Tobey during the final battle would have had a bigger roar from the audience. Like maybe when Tom is beaten down, Tobey and Andrew suddenly swing in through the portal. I genuinely believed that's how their entrance would be. Or maybe in the case of Andrew, he would suddenly enter to save MJ as they teased in the trailer.
Zendaya looking at Tom making sure he wont spoil anything hh ahahaha
6:36 for anyone that has officially is able to watch no way home.
Finally I can watch these interviews 😅 Finally I got to see the movie ☺
*He knows.*
Just look at Ned's head 🥚🥚
Why do they all look like they just stepped through a portal from the 80s?
I bet there is a hidden sniper to make sure they wont spoil the movie
6:36 Jacob’s laugh could tell Tobey and Andrew were gonna be in NWH!
6:36  Jimmy: Tobey Mag- Tom: Yes!  *Facepalm* This dude! 😂🤣
Tom's American accent in the movie is just so original.. 😱
Tom is so adorable when he’s not realizing he’s giving out some clues.
If you have seen this movie  👇
OMG she is so fine
Hope Tobey And Andrew get an interview when they release the Blu-Ray/DVD👌🔥🔥
7:03 Tom spoils again
Tom Holland and Tom Cruise shop shoes in the same store called ... Lifts..
He is really hold not to give a spoil...
The whole video u can see the worry on Benedict's face looking at tom
oh kimmel
6:39 石直球すき
Tom was trying so hard not to spoil anything lol 😂
Yes, I will help my baby!!
I bet sony and marvel is gonna hate jimmy for this
These TV talk shows feel like they are made to make the public watching docile. All these aww moments and funny La la land like conversations which keeps public from real issues and shitty thing that corporations, government, organizations are doing.
The movie was so awesome but my dad dod notnlike it at all😶
So good to see Jacob part of this interview!! So many good actors and actresses in the movie that aren't necessarily main characters
Capital style “insurrection”, classy. They probably get paid for every agenda based suggestions they make. It’s blatant.
8:04 "I keep bumping into them!.🤭🤨" hmmmm thats sus tom. Now that I've seen the movie thats so funny 🤣
Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield. Go Ahead.    I'm done bro. 😂😂😂
Benedict is the best
5:10 Look at Benedict's face he so worried when Tom is talking
I get anxiety whenever Tom talks. ahaaha I feel like he's gonna slip up hahaha
I like that Tom really scared to spoil it so he literally say to avoid him and ask him about it 😂
6:34 Only god can help us
Tom talks… everyone holds their breath because he is a walking spoiler..
at the beginning I don’t understand what kind of bald man is sitting there
7:55 Didn't expect to hear that from Benedict
6:36. Highlight of the interview and what Jimmy and us wants to know the most about!!
Everyone is being nervous when tom is talking 😅
6:35 nailed it
Petition to put Jimmy Kimmel in the MCU. 👍🏻
Kimmel can reprise his role as Karl Malone in the next Spider Man movie.
everytime tom speaks, i love how all three of them looks at him intently ready to jump at him at first sign of spoiler. 😁
I think a Marvel Movie would he totally awesome and funny if Jimmy will be actually in the movie. Then he's going to meet Dead Pool. Lol.
5:54  Tom looking towards Benedict and thinking Am I doin it right or spoilin the movie??
i like tom holland's british accent
Look how red Benedict Cumberbatch is the whole time! Haha
06:36 Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield Even everyone's laugh was a spoiler 😂
Jacobs laugh from 2:43 is just perfection 👌
Well jimmy wanted to be in the movie and the least he could get was the birthday party joke😂😂
we need interviews with andrew and tobey immediately haha
2:43 6:40 7:08 7:24 Foreshadowing of the Hob Goblin
It's nice to acknowledge the. Storyline but still think casting was as wrong hiring Andrew Garfield to play spiderman or Jammie Foxx to play electro. Like the spiderman franchise deserves better than the runoff of twilight and we'll the one guy who can't act nor sing or do comedy yet he's a signer actor and comdidean. How idk man he's just a pretty boy . Electro deserved better.
I love how red Benedict is during this entire interview lmao
I love how in the movie Kraven the hunter is actually part of the dimension rift so maybe Kimmel got his wish
Overall movie was not good but seeing 3 spider-men it was cool so I give 5/10. But after comparing all of the Spider-men best of all Amazing Spider-Man by Adrew Garfield.
I loved Toby in the movie! It was so great and he looked fabulous ❤
This movie emotionally wrecked me in the best way
Freaking lobster strange over here
After watching the movie i know who kicked lizard
SALVE KARALHOOOOOOOO 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
really hoping three spidey of them and the villain gang invited to the interview, please kimmel 😁
Tobey Maguire is a Legend. This kid should have give him respect.
7:35, lol it looks like Tom holland genuinely gets upset with Jimmy
THE WAY CUMBERBATCH IS TURNING PURPLE FROM ANXIETY OR LAUGHTER OR BOTH
I watched this a month ago without thinking much about it. I mean it would have been great and everything to see Andrew in the suit again. Then seeing the movie  two days ago and found out it was actually true was just really amazing!
2:05 neither does Zendeya lmaooo cause she never saw it at 1:47
Imagine the guys who created a fake tv interview/visit for Tobey and Andrew and now we're just waiting coz surely they will be INVITED to REALLY be INTERVIEWED of how Legendary this Movie is!
7:51 zendaya being nervous zendaya: is this the same dialogue aunt may says when he died
every tom holland movie needs to have adult supervision, just incase of spoiling the entire movie.
lmao first time laughed on a jimmy kimmel video
Ned: "I can't believe I'm in the Sanctum Sanctorum"  Steven: "Neither can I" Lol
To the producers of this show, please invite all the three spiderman and your views will definitely break the internet
When will we get the three of them together on an interview
Tom is doing better i see with spoilers
I got it was miles cuase is spider verse  we see him change  invisible in that movie
OMG I LOVE SENYA AND TON HALPONAF OMMGGGG WOAHAHHAHAHAY
At 6:37 Tom said yes after Jimmy said Tobey Maguire.
Zendaya looking awesome in that outfit. 👍💯
Actually KRAVEN was in the NWH 😳
Imagine how funny it would’ve been it they tried to confirm Ant-Man, it woulda got people thinkin lmao
Spoilers   Now we need a episode with the 3 of them
Forgot Tom is British 😭
Please scoobydoo this **censored*
Just watched it this morning and I cried so much 😭😭😭
They missed the chance to say that it was Drax who punched the Lizard lol
2:43 Jacob's laugh is hilarious
Tom was SWEATING lmao
Just look at Tom how he’s sitting right there!  He became a boy to a man  Woah!
Who's here after watching the movie
Jimmy said “Capitol style insurrection”😭
i was reading this and accidentally read “andey magrfield”
Benedict panicking when Tom speaks 4:37 😂
With great power comes great electricity bill.
This movie was so awesome.  I watched it twice already.
nobody:  zendaya: causally wearing red bottoms
Can't wait for the interview with all the important cast. It will be amazing!
Spiderman betrays doctor strange and the Marvel Cinematic Universe will forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man
I didn't know Tom is English..same as Benedict..
I love how Benedict watches so intently as Tom speaks like "watch yourself boy"
Who's here after NWH 👇👇👇
o trailer do brasil gente KAKAKAKAKAKAKAKAKAKAKAKAKAKAKA
Ned Peter and MJ are all hotter in real life compared to in the film. Just like the main cast of big bang (except penny).  Why is that?  Is it make up on the actors? (Make actors more attractive than on the show/movie)  Or make down on the characters? (Make characters less attractive but the actors are already very attractive)
Worst MJ ever. I don't know why I don't like her. So irritating 🙂
this movie is my favorite marvel movie. would rewatch if i wasn't traumatized.
This had to be the best Jimmy Kimmel episode😂😂😂, pressing all of them asking if Toby and Andrew are in the movie
7:14 WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THIS!
i would've paid good money to be in the room when jimmy mentioned tobey and andrew
6:36 "Tobey Maguire. Andrew Garfield. Go ahead."
Jesus Loves You
God Is Good
Jesus Is King
The colors of Tom's suit is lovely!
Where are the interview with  the true stars, tobey, andrew, willian, molina, electro, such tom don't it is
who wouid love to see RDJ as the new Stan-Lee after 20 years?
Benedict: With being in a superhero movie comes with a great contractional liability LOL🤣
I hardly ever agree with the critics, because they tend to be killjoys. But they say Tom Holland put in an outstanding performance and I agree with them, Tom was phenomenal. It was great seeing Andrew and Tobey back for the fan service and nostalgia, but Tom owned this movie. Don’t get me wrong all the supporting actors were great, but Tom excelled. This movie is insane, I will go and watch it again.  My favourite Superhero is now Spider-Man.
after watching, i felt like the movie is more of andrew's spiderman redemption.
Spider man: Homecoming  Spider man: Far From Home  Spider man: No Way Home  Next Spider man: What’s A Home  Spider man: Homeless
7:47, great choice of words
Jacob's laugh is the best
Benedict Cumberbatch looks quite brown here (dark pink actually). Either it's studio makeup or he just spent a couple weeks somewhere warm with a beach and a pool.
watch it guys, it's awesome even though YT spoils so many already
Andrew was a good Spider-Man but crappy Peter Parker. Tom hasn’t fully became Spider-Man until the last segment of this movie. Tobey is Spider-Man.
If there's ever gonna be a Tintin movie, i need Tommy to play in it.
it was John Cena
Jimmy Kimmel is being such a scumbag trying to get them into trouble.
Jimmy kimmel as kraven the hunter
Millionaires chatting: Jimmy Kimmel's net worth: 50 million, Benedict Cumberbatch: 40 million, Tom Holland: 21 million, Zendaya: 15 million, Jacob Batalon: 4 million...
That movie was totally awesome...funny, excited,sad and full of action...all the cameos and a hint of all the other marvel Heroes and villains entering the MCU because of the rift created in the movie.. I loved it...
Damn I hate his accent
Tobey and Andrew were in the movie
This was such a fire interview! All the actors were hilarious, Jimmy's questions were on point, and the deflections were also very smooth. Words can't express how much this movie meant to me!
i might be missing something, but anyone else think it was really rude of jimmy kimmel to try and bait one of them into spilling something? like he KNOWS they're under contractual obligation not to say anything and he still asked and put them in an incredibly awkward position, especially because they were just as aware of the evidence and leaked pictures as anyone else.
Probably the best movie I've seen I love how they added in the old spidermen and the way they all worked together is just Beautiful love all the actors and the movie!
TOBEY FTW 😍 the only Spiderman that matter 🙌
Tom sweats when he has to lie lol
It was so funny that Jimmy tried to get the spoiler out of them lol
I thought no spoilers !!!!
I loved No Way Home, but in my opinion, there was a negative thing. Trailers has spoiled too much, indeed, when i went to the cinema, i almost knew all the scenes and what made me and the audience jump from the seats, was the introduction on the other 2 spidermans. Anyway, it was amazing and this proved that Marvel cares about Sam Raimi, their old fans and Raimi's prototype of spiderman which i love. Thanks to Marvel, Amazing Spiderman 1 and 2 and the first 3 films of Spiderman with Tobey Maguire; they are finally canonic, changing, from now on, the entire story of spiderman and of course of the other superheros. After a few days, what shoked a part of spidey's fans was a post of Lil Nas X which said that he would have been in the film of Miles Morales. It's not a bad idea, even if i don't like him lately due to his strange behaviour. Honestly, i would like to be Miles as i did a photoshop using Morales' suit from ps5 game and i fit very well in there. If you wanna check it, find fantasy on insta.
why does aunt may die.
I love the new Spider-Man
Tom holland tertekan 😆😆😆
Jimmy did a good job
6:40 OMG look at benedicts face after jimmy says "tobey maguire, Andrew garfield" he's like jimmy shut up
Thank you and God bless
7:47 look at Zendaya's reaction when Jimmy said "with great power comes responsibility"😂 like 'wait... how he knew!?'
Jimmy w 720p🤣
We want Tobey and Andrew Interview 😭
6:43   Possibly an even worse-kept secret than Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan N S (for the record, that was JJ Abrams prevaricating to the world back then) ~
Still like toby maguire.
lol in england this movie was already out
4:52 thought he was gonna say 3 generations of spiderman movies.
6:35
Tom looks so handsome with that suit
I wish Tom Holland would have said that it was Miles Morales because he can become invisible.
Interview Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield!
I just love how Jacob just laughs every time Jimmy shows the trailer and especially the second one 😆 and you can tell Benedict is trying so hard not to laugh and Tom is still new to having this much attention so he's just saying like "Wow what is that" and you can tell Zendaya is helping him with the talk to not give out spoiling or giving clues haha
tom was fighting for his life LMAOOO
I’ve watched all the Tom Holland Spider-Man movies and I’ve been meaning to watch the others. I went and saw this one and omg was it amazing....I now definitely need to watch the others but not sure if it’ll be the same 😂
4:51 is definitely a spoil
We need an interview with Tobey Andrew and Tom
Ned  ...ugh Ned!  ... I hope he doesn't realize this character is all he has. It'll be better when he finds out from every failed casting call to come smdh
This is hilarious
The movie is sooo good I wanna cryyyy so baddd
Jacob has the BEST laugh
7:55 with being in a superhero film comes great contractual liability
Each and every time Benedict looks at tom🤣🤣  don't spoil please 😁😁
Is a great movie  I'll probably go to the theater and see it again
Tobey - How did that get in ? Tom - How did that get out ?
Congratulations to me. I have saved your all 6:36 minutes of time.
Tobey Maguire is the best spiderman of all time.
you could tell chemistry was real.
the way benedict watches tom as he speaks so closely to make sure he doesn't spoil anything is so funny
Why is tom wearing shoes with a 5" sole? Have he not made peace with his height?
I really want to meet Zandaya and Tom Holland
I just can't stant this zendaya... By far the worst actress i've seen in a long time. Cringy to watch..
And oh i didnt know Ned is filipino until grandma speaks! 😂😄 I enjoyed everything in this movie.
I love how emotional i was in this movie. I had teary eyes while watching the later part. Just so good.
We want all three Spiderman interview
6:49 tom saying “who are they?” reminds me of that one interview with jeremy where he got asked about yelena.
Lizard wasnt punched actully
Spoiler alert !! That was not punch that was kick of ...,.....,............😂😂😂😂
Why involving of Tobey and Andrew in No Way Home is being keep as a secret?
It was such a good movie😩
Tom just hinted the end of the movie by saying "who are they" XD
Jimmy cameo as a jameson variant
zendaya so confident and look beauty
I feel like Benedict was intentionally sent with them to not let these three spill all the spoilers 😂
Jimmy Kimmel villain scared me, ngl
Tom and Zendaya has no on screen rapport
I want to see Tobey and Andrew in an interview please
Happy
its amazing how Jacob batalon Can retract and Grow his hair So fast Cus in interviews and stuff hes bald then He instantly grows hair again for stuff like no way home
6:35 toms face bruh
Tom deserves a Oscar for not spoiling this masterpiece ❤️
Good old days...when they all denied😂😂
Tobey will ALWAYS be my favorite spiderman
Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield......... GO AHEAD!
Izroil raver cni ok ahmer i am venic ta jug sawo amajadimeana hailey kelyeie jener ema whatson dukatati mana venic venic venic venic
Spiderman jumped the shark with this movie.
Benedict Cumberbatch taught Tom good, hahaha. NO SPOILERS!
I loved it when Jimmy asked them about Tobey and Andrew that Benedict didn't give any reaction. Jacob laughed and Tom just looked at Benedict like he was asking " What the hell is that? "
A loveletter for spiderman fans! All 3 are and where great!
Must have been difficult that bullet for Tobey and Garfield from Jimmy. LOL
bro jacobs laugh when they showed the lizard was funny 💀💀
Benedict in the back seat...can't accept it..he should've not come
6:35 was lit 😂😂
"With being in a superhero film comes great contractual liability." - Benedict Cumberbatch LOOOLLLLLL
2:37 Damn! He was right about that lizard getting punched!
I love watching Zendaya melt into the chair
THEY GO SOO RED LMAOOOOO
the funny thing is, kraven the hunter literally IS an easter egg
Just finished watching it. It was EVERYTHING you could ask for! Tobey had me laughing and then crying! Only thing that could’ve been better was if they had found some way to bring the different MJs into it.
The Gurlfild's Spider-Man punched the Lizard. It's obvious guys, come on)))
Seeing this after No Way Home is so funny and even better than before the film LOL
Is Jimmy drunk or high?  Sounds like he is slurring his words
"it's a bird!"
06:39 Look At Benedict's face, he is definitely the most mature among this lot when it comes to not giving spoilers He had almost a straight face while Tom zendeya and  Jacob bursted out laughing
6:35 i'm still laughing af featuring Jacob Batalon
4:47 Benedict is giving Tom death eyes just *waiting* for him to slip up to jump in lol
Benedict is HILARIOUS
Zendaya is beautiful
Can’t believe I haven’t seen it!
Benedict in his mind... Don't you give up the secret... Tom
Tom is trying to act like hes the best spiderman lmao
Ok but Jimmy knew what he was doing when he said “with great power comes great responsibility”
YouTube should remove the preview comment....sneaky suckers
It's a bird😂😂😂  Yes tom it's a bird called tobey Maguire 😂😂
Cumberbatch's wit is the best out of all the people there
Others: We want Tobey and Andrew in this film  Me: I want to see Stan Lee cameo in this scene (Rest in Peace 🕊️)
The internet definitely ruined this moment for us.
I'm watching this. Again😁
All credits go to Tobey Maguire, without him our childhood lives would have been a mess
You know, the thing that really makes me think is--yeah, DaFoe and Molina _did_ have to use more practical effects for their respective characters. I wonder what the train of thought is for actors like them--to play a supervillain and have to use puppets and other such props (maybe the glider was harnessed up back then too? I don't know) and then 20 years later half the work that you did with the bombs and the robot arms and the planned explosions is covered by post-production and all you have to do is react/mime it. Does that make it more or less technical? Harder or easier? I wonder if the people on this panel had to show them the ropes? I'd love to hear how that whole thing worked on set.  This is coming from someone who's seen the movie, btw. There were scenes with both of them where I just wondered "wait, how the hell did that work on set? Is that harnesses or CGI? Whatever it is, it's amazing."  Also: "Tobey Maguire. Andrew Garfield. Go ahead." XD XD
It's hilarious when you know the true intention of how Benedict Cumberbatch adorely watches Tom Holland when in reality he's just making sure no spoiler the kid spits out 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Tudo culpa do trailer brasileiro haha
Best spiderman is my life tobey Maguire
3 generations?!
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
love how jacob is always laughing 😭
just re-watched the Tobey maguire Spiderman 1,2,and 3.   Hes not replaceable... the movies are even better now. Seriously like fine wine.... the emotions in them are beautiful and so convincing he is the BEST Spiderman and only one for me.
The movie is sooo good the best Marvel film in my opinion by far, still not over the ending if I’m being honest 😂 I’m going to see it again tomorrow, it’s got so many emotions in it, nothing is even close to it’s greatness 😂
three generations of ….. cinema I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA SPOIL IT LMFAOOOO.
Tom must have gotten coached by Toby and Andrew 🤣
After watching no way home, I just laugh when ever they cover something up
The movie was amazing. What I like most about it was that it honestly feels like an origin story. With a boy truly becoming a man. Obviously there is a life changing death, and Peter is forced to grow up. I loved it
I watched the movie in 3D today ❤️
5:11 TOM WENT AND SPOILED TOBEY'S BACKACHE SCENE!!
We just want all 3 Spider-Man’s in an interview please
Can't stand Tom Holland. Way to talk like a one-note American teenager the whole life long. Eternally stuck in one line of 2016 or whatever.
7:08 Benedict: say a word and I'll snap your neck harder than Gwen's
Just Bring Tom, Tobey and Andrew For A Interview Together Now. I mean Jimmy just think about the Tv Ratings and Youtube Views Man 😈
6:26  Jimmy: "We'll follow you home too, and...." Jacob:  "There is No Way Home"  Missed opportunity.
All time Amazing Spider-Man movie.
someone gonna get fired for that editing error tho
something is missing it's not the same without iron-man
Tom Holland has two types of security guards on his side. For one the normal security who get paid for their jobs to keep Tom safe and for two Benedict for keeping the audience safe for Tom Spoilland himself! ;-)
Come on. The bald guy laugh had confirm Tobey Maguire n Andy Garfield are in the movie. No need for Tom to spill the beans, it's always the "best friend" spill it
3 spidermen in 1 movie, THE BEST 😭
It be a great twist if Ned Leeds learns magic and then turns against his friend becoming Hobgoblin.
A BIRD??????????
Spiderman 2002 Toby Maguire the best of all times , shut up kids
6:44 That eye contact right there
6:41 "just clap too everything will be fine"
6:36
Best tribute to Spider-Man fans …..all three together
Without Tobey and his spidey, super hero genre would’ve never been this big
I love how they all look at Tom when he talks making sure he doesn’t spoil the entire movie
Now we need Andrew, Tobey, and Tom interview together!!
I pray that Kimmel is never in a single scene in any MCU movie, that would be the end.  He is disliked by so many, and is only scene in spots like this because of the guests
zendaya accidentally gave it away at 6:37. when jimmy says “tobey mcguire” she instinctively nodes and says yes lol. good thing no one really noticed. Whew
*JACOB: CAN'T STOP LAUGHING 😂*
I don't care what anyone says ned dies in the movie.  Congrats you got spoiled
Tobey and Andrew were in the interview but they used invisible suits made by Stark.
Benedict is so witty and funny
"on the set?" I LOST IT
Ned is ancient one...
Its funny when they were asked a question about tobey and andrw and they just laugh
Me and my dad went to watch spiderman no way home yesterday and he said that Tobey Maguire looks like “Rahul Gandhi” and now I can't unhear it....
Nah man, this Peter Parker has had it the hardest of all the Peters gotta say
Jimmy should have been in the FBI
Tom & Zendaya think there funny
6:04 in here Toms humour looks like RDJ 😍
Aunt May dies
2:38
No worries for me I ""NOT RECOMMENDED"" everything in which there were TOM AND ANDREW of course until I Watched the movie  And  CAUGHT THE WEREWOLF
i like how Benedict was so tense listening to Tom's monologuing 😂😭
Tom kata gua mending lu diem ajaaaa
Tom kata gua lu diem aja
Even on a super hero movie interview, this twip still manages to get political. January 6th was as much an insurrection as Biden is a good president, Ole Jimbo
Tinha que ser no Brasil  😂😂😂
Jacob's laugh is so contagious holy lmao. When he was laughing at the mess up that Brazil did with the trailer had me dead.
I hope Stan Lee can see this movie. RIP. Great cameo.
"Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, go ahead"  Never had a laugh so hard and loud in a long time😂
"With being in a superhero film comes great contractual liability." - Benedict Cumberbatch
The way Benedict is nervously watching Tom as he talks is hilarious.
7:47 Jimmy: With great power comes great responsibility  Benedict: With being in a superhero film comes great contractual liability This killed me, Benedict is so quick and witty
It’s always lovely to see Benedict reprise his role as anti-spoiler babysitter.
This movie, more than anything, felt like a love letter to all Spiderman fans. Definitely my favourite Marvel movie now
2:38 I am really curious what happened to the guy who edited the trailer in brazil :d
Marvel is all fun and game. DC perhaps can take some notes now.   well, they are all good.   just watched movie. its truly a celebration.
Don't even know how they can say it's the sinister six when there's only five villains lmao
I like Zendaya , But I don’t like her Acting
this movie is insane
Jacob laughing like he didn’t summon the spider-men
Home-Coming 2017 Far from  home 2019 No way home 2021 Can't get home 2023 Can't find a home 2025 Home-sick 2027 Stuck at home 2029 No more home 2031 Bought new home 2033 I hate homes 2035 Spider home 2037
Really tom has grown up alot 😂he don't spoil anything more. Jimmy was on full rage mode asking questions 😁
Wait... This man is suitable to be Kraven the hunter 🧐
My favorite spiderman tubey Maguire
You’re no artist. An artist respects the silence, it serves the foundation of creativity
Stan Lee would have loved this movie
Jimmy gotta hit the gym for kraven the hunter lol
The movie came out already. If u haven’t seen it u a chump lol
We want tobey and andrew
Guess I’m happy with my choice of not watching any interviews with the cast before watching the actual movie because for me, the reunion was a very nice surprise ! I  went down memory lane and I might’ve teared up a bit…
please we all know its the ghost of uncle ben who punched the lizard
💚💜💚💜💚💜 *Tom's outfit colors sends out major Zendaya vibes from the Graham Norton Show's interview!*
I watched the movie twice but i want to watch the same movie with new eyes
Notice how Andrew literally timed all his press interviews to end right when No Way Home premiered! He is in hiding right now, hahaha!
Now I’m waiting for Tobey, Andrew, and Tom to be pulled in for an interview. They deserve it. Such a massive movie.
Can we just have Tom, Andrew and Tobey together in an interview now that we know?  Also, please confront Andrew 😅 would love to see that!
Tom Holland is NOT that funny zendaya cmon girl
FYI no one was charged with insurrection on Jan 6th. They were all charged  for individual crimes they committed like theft, fighting a cop ect.
Watched the movie last week. Dammnn the audience in the movie theater was so in awe when there's 3 peter🤣
7:04 “I’ve actually recently been bumping into them like all the time”—Tom “On set?”—Jimmy GREAT twist, Jimmy, well done
Love this
“Put me in this movie for gods sake”  The editors in post prod:😅
The only thing missing on this film is a Stan Lee cameo...he would've been so proud
Now i am waiting for the Three to interview together
they could have said lizard was punched by antman
Tom is so relatable imperfect not polished. One of the most honest actors, very innocent
@6:35 "Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield...go 'head!" I think hearing the thoughts of Benedict Cumberbatch would be PURE comedy 😆!
Noone would've believed them, but Antman would've been a good explanation.
God post NWH this is hilarious
Benedict's nervous laugh tho lol
“You know theres gonna be like a capital style insurrection if theyre not in this movie right?” That was so true it physically pains me
Jacob cracking up at the Lizard clip had me dying lmaoooo
I looooooove Tooooom and Zendaaaya ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 and I am done with everything cleaning in the hous and my mum is in the Turkey 😂😂😂❣️❤️❣️🫶🏼👏🏻🧽🧼🍽🧹🪣🧺✅😙😎🥰🎉🤍🇹🇷
7:13 Spider-Man fans are crazy but we’re not that crazy 😂🤷🏾‍♂️
When Jimmy said "Tobey Maguiere, Andrew Garfield, go ahead!" Tom's face was like someone splashed the water at him lol 6:39
Best acting by Spiderman cast
jimmy defines us as fans 😂❤
The look Ben gave Jimmy... Lmfao
"Sadie sink" 👩🏼‍🦰would be the perfect Mary Janes for the Amazing Spiderman since Guin was gone😢
Toby and Andrew were better as Spider-Man. There, I've said it.
For anyone interested I made a video (with help) recreating a scene from Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man on this channel.
When Tobey and Andrew entry in Spiderman recent movie everyone whistles in theatres .
6:34
tom is worried 😅
I don't really care for Funko Pops, but if they made one of the Lizard getting ghost punched I would buy it.
i’m honestly so proud of tom from not spoiling this movie
Previously Peter have Tony as a mentor. Now he has uncle strange as his mentor.
SPOILER WARNING     0:08 Am I the only one who wants to see ned become the next Wong. Like ned easily opened the portal to get Andrew and Tobey while it took students multiple lessons. Ned did it perfectly, and by accident
tom holland become so success
the "it's a bird" is an easter egg
best movie for me this year ,i mean spider man
I like how the new movie is overshadowed by this "Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire" rumor...😂🤣
Toby McGuire, Andrew Garfield go ahead hahahaha
Jimmy talking about Easter eggs  Me -" who do u think is directing the film Taylor Swift 😶"
Why the HELL did you the best friend shaved his head?? Now he is unrecognizable and his few fans won't know it's him, there goes his Only chance to get laid !! :(
6:35
I love Benedict Cumberbatch.
Who has not seen it yet: go watch it! It's a masterpiece
Jimmy: Let’s not get into any spoilers Also Jimmy: Now give me a breakdown of the entire plot of the movie
Tom said yes after he said tobys name
Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield... Go ahead 😂😂😂
Nope. They aren't there I just watched
Aunt may got her  back blown out by green goblin
Pretty horrible Jimmy spoils that the other Spider men are in the movie.  I knew nothing.  Their appearance was amazing.  Yet Jimmy couldn't leave that alone.  Really sucks.
I feel like marvel should add a conditional 5% extra to these actors' payslips for all this MAJOR dogging of questions they are doing. This is actual work. 5% extra if you can manage to keep the secret, no bonus if you spill :P
Why did everyone look at Tom when he said really 2:21
Ned's reaction when Lizard gets hit lmao
tom rlly said “just don’t talk to me”😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Deoderant? 😂😅🤣
Zendaya is just flawless ❤️😍👌🏽
Asking for 'please' is getting way too old. In fact, it is obnoxious and annoying. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I seen that debre theory when the first came out makes sense but nope ;)
So many lies....
Love these guys
Benedict is red as a tomato trying not to slip up lol.
Omggg
I love that Kraven was actually outlined in the multiverse crack
Just imagine how great the reveal in the movie would have been if people had actually kept the secret instead of making it unconfirmed. People wouldn't be demanding to know so that their hopes wouldn't be dashed. This is why these sorts of leaks shouldn't happen, so people can stand up and say "oh my god!" in the theater instead of remain seated and say "oh thank god". People in news outlets are just so damn greedy about being the ones to break a story.
I’m so obsessed with Tom Holland, he’s such a likeable guy.
I’m so obsessed with Tobey Maguire, he’s such a likeable guy.
Secrets of Thor ragnarok are now here.. @
Benedict is a fkn legend
No spoiler review :-    Aunt may dies ......tobey and andrew  returns.....a  piece of venom is left in mcu and everyone forgets tom holand spiderman
6:31
This is not an interview, this is an interrogation. Poor Benavoid Spoilerbatch is sweating the whole time.
LMAO
I never would've thought I would have and End Game experience again. No Way Home made me feel that feeling again and so much more!
JIMMY PLEASE YOU HAVE TO FINALLY INVITE ALL THREE OF THEM AFTER THE HOLLIDAYS!
Tom Holland back at it in spoiling Tobey and Andrew's appearance in the movie LOL 06:50 and 07:18
You could see the pissed off benedict when jimmy mentioned tobey and andrew’s name
Jacob’s laugh is everything
Jesus Loves Yall And Is The Way To Everlasting Life ✝️
6:06
What the hell is Zendaya wearing? Looks like toilet paper
love the way u lie❤
Incredible opportunity of a lifetime to see this movie
Hope to see a 3-spidermen interview <3 <3
Ive grown out of marvel movies but this cast is always delightful
why is Ned bald?
I need to see interview with tom holland, the werewolf and youth pastor in one screen
The way Tom has grown up, is like he’s mirroring RDJ with his attitude and answers
I only trust Tom when he’s with Ben 😂😂
Aunt May died, Aunt May died,Aunt May died,  Aunt May died, Aunt May died, Aunt May died, Aunt May died, Aunt May died, Aunt May died, Aunt May died, Aunt May died, Aunt May died, Aunt May died,
Benedict is soo concerned when Tom talks.
Jacob Batalon's laugh is soo contagious gad damn it HAHHAHAHAHHA
jimmy : *shows the clip from brazilian trailer* literally everyone : ok stay calm, this is what the last three years is about
I wanted to see the trailer with the kids asking questions. Why do you always end the video after you announce cool stuff we can't watch? Merry Christmas. Much love from Portugal.
He is missed Lizard
I think Andrew Garfield is best for spidy
Me: I have watched Spiderman no way home , now there's no meaning in life   Tobey: I missed the part where that's my problem
Tom Wearing lifters to match zendaya 🤣🤣🤣
this aged … very well😂
Let's be honest, It's like seeing RDJ 'Junior' take charged the situation 💖 I bet we can't get enough with all marvel cast.. Please bring them all back in one enormous movie again!
I have to say thank you Ned
This is so hilarious to watch especially after watching the film 😂
Its obviously Miles Morales.
SPOILER  ALERT   SPOILER ALERT   SPOILER ALERT   SPOILER ALERT   SPOILER ALERT   May dies😁
Its almost unbearable cuz all of them know that fans knows both Andrew and toby will be in the movie but they cant just blurt it out for confirmation
Well Jimmy was not wrong, we did see a sneak peek of Kraven the hunter in the movie
Now we want Tobey and Andrew's interview
zendaya is wearing toilet paper wtf
Who else wants to see the three spidermen is an interview?
is jimmy kraven lol
😂😂😂
tobey n andrew is a couple.
Is that kid diagnosed with cancer
Jacob cracking up makes it even funnier.
Jimmy's actually not insufferable here. Way to go!
Jimmy was ON IT during this interview. Holy cow. Well played Jimmy.
You can barely hear Tom saying “yes they….” But paused so quick I believe the clapping hid it really well too almost slipped up Tom 6:35
Tobey is the best...nobody can replace him
Looking back , it was so obvious but like MJ said , expecting the worse is better because you won’t be disappointed
Brazilian here happy that he mentioned the trailer 🤩
THIS MOVIE IS A MUST SEE!! SO AMAZING!!!!! ❤️💙
Eu escutei o nome do BRASIL gigantão? é isso mesmo?
Jimmy "PLEASE PUT ME IN THIS MO OVIE FOR GOD'S SAKE" KIMMEL 🤣🤣
Peter is punching the lizard with sage mode!!
Scooby do this crap  Was very cringe
poor tom, at one point you can see benedict and zendaya burning holes through him with their eyes. XD
Benedict looks hammered
Benedict losing it, with the Kraven photo is so funny, he keeps remembering and laughing lol
I hope they got Jimmy’s reaction to watching the movie! I would have loved to see it, you can totally tell he’s a really big fan!!
When the Easter egg happened Zendaya turned around too late :(
2:37 😂
they were so bad and denying Andrew and Toby in this interview yet we still had no idea
The way Jimmy pressured Tom ain't looking nice for me by asking spoilers (not surprised tho) Anyway this movie is the best among the MCU's,so much satisfactory and has given us more than we expected ❤️ I thought without OG 6 MCU won't be same anymore but wow! I really like this beginning of phase 4 ,I can't wait what MCU gonna bring in the future
6:23 me when I’m realize I’m famous 🤣🤣
Every time Tom talks, Benedict is like... Waiting to pounce.
Everyone's looking at Tom like Nooo, tom Nou, dont! PETER NO 😂
The synchronized effort to establish that lie was insanely entertaining Everything about this movie is so incredibly 1000/10, it's indescribable Just pure feelings i can't put into words
As big as it was for Toby to make a reappearance, William and Alfred absolutely killed it 100000000000 percent, had me in tears seeing them seeing these three specifically after all these years, this movie will never ever be anything less than a 15/10 for me
Benedict😂😂😂
i love Jacob's super nervous laughter
Os fãs brasileiros são Foda mesmo. Os próprios CSI hahahha
2:40  In fact, it was Draxx !
Benedict being the most disciplined one trying to control everything especially Tom. Hahahahaha. The calm and demeanour! I cannot!!!
Tom was so nervous 😂
thank god I didnt watch this before watching the movie because its pretty damn obvious if "you know whos" are in the movie or not
I like how Tom is sticking to the same story on every interview about how amazed they are making the spider man movies now 😂
1:24 Mark Hamill Joker laugh
anyone find the easter egg? what is it?
Tom Holland and Erling Haaland look like twins
Kemmel was RELENTLESS in trying to break Tom. Hilarious, loved it.
6:35 Here's the thing you came here for.
I miss Conan
When will tobey andrew and tom pop up for an interview together??😭😭😭
2:45 “It’s a bird.” -Tom Holland 2021
Im excited for tobey and andrew to be interviewed about NWH
👀
This movie is like once in a generation!!
The one and only movie when you know had spoiler but still interest to watch it 😆
2:35 Jimmy is genius
Tom trying not to get fired of the job and jimmy just spoiling the movie
Zendaya sounds like JLO
7:06 Benedict literally turning into red tomato 🍅 he’s so anxious poor dear 😭😭😭
6:37 benedict’s enjoyin it!!!
the fact that after watching the movie that one of the 3 spider-man’s were actually punching the lizard is so hilarious. jimmy’s actually right and i fist pumped the air when i remembered watching this interview when i saw the movie today.
“This is kinda your mess.” Okay Peter, you’re not gonna mention that it was you who interfered with the spell?
spider man: calls the dudes again  mit: agrees End of movie.
Movie gave me goosebumps so good
The cast was trying really really to not to spoil anything 😂😂
WE 👏 WANT👏 TOBEY👏 ANDREW👏 TOM👏 INTERVIEW👏TOGETHER👏PLS👏
No but like imagine andrew’s and tobey’s and tom’s interview together😀
For ever quoting from Shakespeare.  Twelfth Night.
benedict is watching tom like a hawk lol
bro you could tell Benedict was worried about Tom spoiling Tobey and Andrew 😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Tom did good not spoiling 😂
Cumberbatch is staring at Holland watching for spoiler.
Hey next time you want to give seat front for strange
Jimmy kimmel🤡🤡🤡🤡
Tom look like shawn mendes
“Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield. Go ahead”  Benedict: laughing nervously LOL
if you want to know if you have to watch a movie first, then you will know what is not in the trailer.
it's just so funny to see them all stressed trying to not spoil anything lmfao
Jimmy Kimmel is a clown
this is one of the best movies i've ever seen, not just in terms of Marvel
7:12 I agree with him on this. I would have burned the marvel if they were not.
“Capital style insurrection” is an unnecessary comment. Especially given he doesn’t want to accept the truth as to what happened at the protest.
"Debris" punching the Lizard, yeah.... right....
there is nothing I love more than Jacob's laugh
Hahaha this is the most funny interview for spiderman no way hom great job jimmy
Tom Holland carry’s everybody on this cast none of them have charisma or much likability whatsoever 🤦‍♂️
Man I can't believe fans are catching all this from the trailers that's mad!
This movie might be the most rewatchble MCU movie for mw
I love how Jimmy said no I wanna know how you’re getting along with them and the people wanna know to like come on Tom Holland the truth hurts but Tobey Maguire is better than you don’t act cocky…and think your all that Fr… Tom Holland looked very pissed off 😂 7:32
Jimmy: waaaaaaay before u we’re born my Child 😂   I love it how Tom Holland was like quiet and then he said who are they like don’t be mad just because Tobey Maguire is hands-down the best Spider-Man actor there’s no arguing about that and no debating 😂 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯👌🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Now the whole world knew who punched lizard.....
This movies a masterpiece
I am going to be pissed if they do not put Jimmy Kimmel as the new reporter now😭
I love the laughter of Jacob and Benedict 😅
If Tom doesn't spoil anything, Jacob's reactions surely will.
I love how most of the interview is Jimmy trying to break them and make them spoil them movie 😂😂
Absolute masterpiece! ❤️ I watched it in 3D. Gonna watch again!!
Can we stop and appreciate the genius of “With being in a superhero film, comes great contractual liability” lol
Jacob’s laugh is too obvious and annoying.
I wish, some day, Tom, Andrew and Tobey actually do a Spider-Man film together. It would be phenomenally amazing and the crowd will go wild. Till then we have to make ado with No Way Home :(
Spiderman is just Spiderman Best marvel character everrrr
Sometimes I wonder why Marvel even bothers having the actors go on promotional tours like this before a movie considering they pretty much can't talk about the movie.
Sometimes I wonder why Marvel even bothers having the actors go on promotional tours like this before a movie considering they pretty much can't talk about the movie.
i love jacob batalon, he is so funny and i love his laugh!
6:36 The way Jimmy asked them was lit 🤣 6:40 And Benedict was damn Serious about this. 😂
Tom! Spoils Again!

damn jimmy was rly itching for some spoilers. and he only had a few hours to wait?! hahah
Most beautiful movie
For such great actors, they're really bad liars hahaha
Jacob's laugh at 2:42 tho🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
My best friend godson dated Zandaya , very nice person!
LMFAO HE CAME AT THEN WITH TOBEY AND ANDREW OUTTA NOWHERE
With superhero movies comes great contractual liability 🥰🥰🥰
Now make a interview with tobey and andrew
Everyone saying "there's a lot we can't talk about" is basically saying what we already know lol
JIMMY TRYING SO HARD TO GET SPOILERS
They covered up Brazilian trailer so nicely that i m laughing rn after watching whole movie today in theter
The rumors are true 😍 now you have to make a Interview with Andrew and Tobey
Finally went back to the movie theater after a couple of years and saw I this movie, it was great👍👍
i LOVED IT!!!! SO GOOD!!! ( spoiler alert) the whole audience clapped when the other peter parkers (ICONS) came back!!!! LOVE LOVE LOVEEEE
Tobey maguire, Andrew Garfield.. Go ahead  hjahahahaha
I’ll never forget ever
So proud to see Zendaya growing in her career all the way from Shake It Up to K.C. Undercover and and now landing the Spider-Man series and she's just going to continue to grow from here!..
This was really amazing
Zandaya gave it away at 4:10 when she said someone get Sony and marvel in here 🤣 spidermans confirmed
Tom:- Starts speaking  Benedict:- *PTSD* flashbacks
hi

It's fantastic that there decently ended Tobey and Andrews spidermans.
Well so that trailer was true... I'm back here after watching No Way Home... Trust me... Someone is really punching it.. LoL
"Scaffold the incredible pole" 😂
we all know who it was, it was ant man
2:26 🇧🇷👀
falou do brasil
“Tobey maguire, Andrew Garfield. Go ahead” HaHAHAa 😂
I watch at cinema yesterday 3 Spiderman in the movie, that was awesome. Love from Malaysia 🇲🇾
Holland's British accent 💯
The movie was amazing
Dream of all spider man fans came true.
At 7:11 i heard the N word
Jacob Batalon’s laugh is always so wholesome 😂🤣
I will say the following: This movie was totally worth it, we screamed like little kids in the theatre. Love this movie 3000 <3
How can this dummy still have a show ?
Now I known why that lizard got pucnhed by the spider man
Tom Holland got a little bit look like Phil Foden
"Tobey or not Tobey?"
"Evil Doctor Strange" look of Benedict..from Multiverse of Madness 😉
Tinha que ser brasileiro... kkk 🇧🇷
They put Benedict there just to make sure Tom won't spoil anything... This is gold 😂😂
Can’t wait to see all three in interviews 😭
I truly loved this movie. Beat 2 and a half hrs of my life
This movie was amazing
IT WAS SO GOOD HDISKWJED
I love that dress ❤️
2:50 LMAOO😭
It treeo ges who
I will give you a hint
I wan to spoil the scene  but I will not
2:15 interesting
"I'll see you in a bit darling". I don't know why, but knowing Alfred Molina calls people darling has made my day. 😊
Too bad toby and andrew werent in it :/
Would love to see Jimmy in a Marvel film
It feels like Benedict was holding his breath whenever Tom speaks. I can't. 😂 Tom did learn his lesson tho.
😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 4:44
Everyone nice acting 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣 Everyone I am not in movie it's bug😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Watched it and it is officially my favorite movie of all time, so damn good
🔥RAD🔥
Did he just say statue
Tobey and andrew come back in the movie!
He should do impersonate Tobey on saying "my back" :D
Ok butttt how did the rumour about them being in the movie even start anywayyyyyy…. I honestly have no idea
Nwh was better than end game. End of story
When are we getting an interview with all 3 of them
А я толком не понял, о чём рассказывает фильм "Нет пути домой". Общей истории нет, нет общей мотивации, при этом есть суперский актёрский состав и ничего более... жаль, я лично разочарован в фильме.
Im waiting batman multiverse, plz make it happens DC
naboyagan rako hahaha
2:56 i like that they are making up story to coverup tobey maguire and andrew garfield but im tellih you the guy that punched lizard was andrew garfield (by the way spoilers dont read)
tom was 100% shitting himself when they mentions toby and andrew
My favourite part in the movie was when Peter used the infinity stones to bring back Tony
i have to say im disapointed, i definitely expected tobey and andrew in this movie 😥
guys sorry but its photoshop
Amazing movie
new favorite movie it was so good🙏🏼
Where is Tobey Maguire?
Get ready for Magic Hobgoblin
GET THIS COMMENT ON THE TOP SO WE CAN GET A ANDREW, TOBEY AND TOM INTERVIEW
Andrew Garfield was is the amazing spiderman ever ❤
Watching all of these interview things after watched the movie is satisfying 🤣🤣
I’m so glad i didn’t watch this before the movie
THEY ARE IN THE MOVIE BEST MOVIE EVER  SEEING TOBBEY WAS THE BEST THING EVER!
I loved the film!!!! It was amazing that because basically the three spiderman were in the film !!
Whole movie was photoshopped
Jimmy I’m not goanna lie this is messed up how u did This days before the movie coming out tryna spoil it for people I thank god I did not come across this u till after watching the movie
benedict is keeping a close eye on tom  LOL!
"With great power comes great responsibility" That hits different after watching the movie
They really didn't lie when they said this is the best MARVEL movie of all time👏
Wonder what Benedict’s babysitting fee is…. 🙈😂😅
This aged well!
Best of Best Spidy Movie 🎥  enjoy the spidy festival
Jimmy: umm Toby McGuire  Tom: Yes 6:36  Anyone else catch that? 😂
Just watched it today in a IMAX screen with packed audience. The cheers and screams to some of characters entrance is so wholesome. The best IMAX and movie experience after 1917 in my opinion. There are so many spine chilling moment. To all the fans of Marvel and especially spiderman ,please watch this masterpiece.
Alternate title: "8 minutes of Tom Holland trying to act his way out of a panic attack." Can't blame the guy either
Had tears in my eyes seeing Tobey in No Way Home, so many memories with Tobey's Spidey.
Why they using this spoiler title? With 3 spidermans in the movie?
Jimmy: "Tobey & Andrew... You know those guys?"  Tom: "Yeah, I've been bumping into them alot recently..."   Jimmy immediately following with the: "On the set!?!?!"   🤣🤣🤣🤣
Someone give Benedict some air.
Petition for Jimmy to officially be  kraven the Hunter
I love Jacob, he's so chill and having so much fun
It was a great movie, watched it the day after it came out solid 42/10
7:10 Jacob Batalon: JIMMY! God... Zendaya: Dang!  That was a transfer of conciousness, I swear!!!
Hahaha kimmel was on fire 🤣🤣
I love at 2:44 you can see the absolute panic in Benedict's and Tom's faces as they rack their brains for a joke/explanation
AHAAHAHAHAHAAHAAAHA They went joke, joke and then he made the funnniest joke AHAAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA such a good observation, Tom ahahahaha
I’ve seen the movie already before I watched this and I’m sorry but I have lost respect for Jimmy. Honestly kinda being rude
They love me
I hope they do a talk show with Andrew Tobey and Tom soon!!!
Seeing them deny Tobey and Andrew in the movie AFTER seeing the actual movie is the funniest thing ever
benedict face and all their reaction towards tom at 7:18 😭😭 tom cant help ksksks
Hilarious interview TOM IS SO SCARED THAT HE MIGHT SPOIL😭😭😂😂😂
If you haven’t seen the movie yet, please don’t read the comments.
Thank god aunt may dies and all the spidermans show up.
I kind of knew that Tobey and Andrew were going to appear because of spoilers, but was excited anyway, but when I saw Charlie  Cox I started crying. Thanks for including the best Daredevil that we had. 🙏🏼
I’m so glad it wasn’t spoiled until I went and watched it with the misses tonight best film marvel have made and they have made all great movies
I watched this movie yesterday, younger me appreciates it so much.
I just saw the movie yesterday and I'm blown away. The parallels, the story-telling, the Animation and special effects, the actors' work.... It's so amazing I just wanna go and watch it all over again. Honestly if I hadn't fallen head over heals for Marvel before, I did now.
I’ve never seen Benedict is so nervous before until now 😂
I wished I didn’t new or saw some spoilers man 😞 what I saw wasn’t anything too bad but I wish I didn’t saw the cast thing because it would’ve been even better seeing my favorites in there 😭
BUNCHA LIARS
now that it's out, u should invite Toby, Andrew, and Tom and just them 3. I really want to see how the 3 of them interact with one another.
Sorry to break your hearts but Tobey is not in the movie. :'(
Here after the movie..
Zendaya looks beautiful!
Don't worry guy I watched it, there is no Andrew or Tobby.
Editing on editing. Marvelous sony
HAHAHAHAHAHh the deodorant joke...
They better do an interview with our three bois now, they deserve it
I'm glad that the movie is out: Kevin Feige's arms needed a break from that sniper rifle.
0:05 I got this feeling that Ned and Wong are family like Uncle and Nephew,  because that magic is in the family.
Bro can’t laugh any louder ? 😭
Watched the movie. Rumors are not true. Tobey and Andrew are not in the movie :(
too much spoiler 😂😂😂😂
Why was benedict looking like he was on a microwave.. is it that hot on the set?
Imagine growing up and not only getting to be Spider-Man, but getting to meet the original and sequel Spider-Man, and the villains.
this movie was amazing ❤️🤩🔥🔥🔥
So funny how at 5:00 Tom starts talking and EVERYONE else freezes like "oh no, he'll say something he can't say"
I shut down everything and avoided all talk, speculation, trailers and shows like this about the movie. Shut down social media etc. I can't believe I pulled it off.    I wanted to be genuinely surprised and it worked.  It made the movie better.  I think sometimes we really need to be patient and let the anticipation and mystery build.
They were in the movie. I actually watched it.
Even the after credits was so good
this movie is just owsome. one of the best marvel ever. we loved
Waiting so badly for the Featurettes and BTS clips to come out!
Wow with a title like that.....jimmy just spoiled the movie.
3:50 Jimmy laughing like Green Goblin🤣
To anyone watching this clip: It contains slight hints of spoilers.
this was the one jimmy kimmel interview i genuinely laughed at.
Benedict did so so well
In love with those ppl
Jimmy Kimmel is a clown for even asking these questions 😂
I just love British accent!
I’m so glad I got to see all 3 Spider-Man’s in one movie 😀
I almost cried at the part when Tobey and Andrew went to their own universe. It was the last time we were gonna see them as Spiderman and I am never gonna forget the moment with crowd cheering for Tobey and Andrew        Wait did I spoiled it 😂 . If u got spoiled then I am sorry.  I couldn't hold it anymore
Lame and fake.
Jimmy didn’t know it then but he kind of stunned the cast when he said with great power comes great responsibility. That was like  a meme quote at one point but it was so important in the new movie
Tobey Maguire is still the Best...❤️❤️👍👍👍
Go. Watch. This. Movie.
It's a master piece worth watching it
WHY ARE YOUR VIDEOS IN 720 EVEN IN 2022 ??????
6:35
Andrew wasn't in the movie
Spoiler: the rumors is true , there is 3....
Me watching the movie:          All the men I’ve ever loved on one screen.
it was so good!
Tom Holland: Finally! My mouth is my villain both in reel and real...and for once...I have controlled it perfectly
This is much more enjoyable to watch if you've seen the movie!!
LIARS
6:40 Benedict's face was like " *Here we go again...* "
I just came back from the cinema, and now I’m hearing Tom Holland speaks British, again,,  Okay my head hurts, I’m so confused LOL 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The movie made me CRINGE.
Why is cumberbach soo red
aunt  may dies just saying
Feeling bad for Tobey and Andrew. They weren’t allowed to go to an interview.😂
The sad thing is if Tobey and Andrew really was in the film, they would never get to be with the main cast on talkshows
i don't think i have every cried this much watching a movie before .. the whole crew did an amazing job
They’re not even hiding it anymore
Ned is related to wong   Here me out   Wong is a secret sourcerer in who’s related to Ned (his uncle possibly) but they all assume he’s just uncle Wong   He’s not  Ned’s family has magic running in it  Piece it together
BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRO HIT LIKE FOR VANISHING THE SPIOLER THAT YOU WATCHED BEFORE THE MOVIE
They are not in the movie guys
omg ANDREW AND TOBEY
IDFC! Tobey and Andrew are in the movie. Sorry guys….
Why is she wearing a toilet paper dress though?
Jacob laugh is pmo
6:40 TOM HOLLAND BE LIKE: OH SH^T HAHAHA XD
Jimmy's guess is so right
I watched it yesterday and it was so GOOD!!!! NOW IT'S MY NUMBER 1 FAVOURITE MARVEL MOVIE 🎬  I want to write so many things but I don't want to spoil anything so go watch it guys!!!!!!!
I just Love Jacobs laught
Google:"In the 🇵🇭 Spider-Man:No way home will release at 01/08/22."  Me:"Great, all I need is *Patience* ." 🙂
They got us in the first half
Best Marvel movie ever, it literally has everything I wanted. beyond my imagination. Thank you marvel and sony for making this. It made my 2021 better.
4:55 big spoiler hahahahaha
MOVIE IS TOTALLY OUTSTANDING .
Dá mais vontade de assistir!!
Ah!! Gostava quando dava dicas sobre os filmes!!
Kraven the Hunter did sort of pop up in the movie
I’m so glad I didn’t watch this interview before watching the movie I was the one with zero spoilers…I got shocked and excited with every scenes
PMSL
Alien in black guu. Russian rhinoceros guy.
Just saw the Spiderman No Way Home film......                       Spoiler: Tobey and Andrew are both back baby!! 🤩
Venom. Officially in mcu's universe now,just venom not Eddie
Saw it yesterday and was so happy that I had managed to avoid almost all spoilers! I only knew about one of the villains, and then I'd forgotten about the Spider-Man meme going on :P
Benedict sweating his pants as Kimmel showed that lizard clip...
Benedict got extra red hearing Toby and Andrew's name 🤣🤣
If they where real hero’s they would be wearing face 😷 masks STOP THE SPREAD!!!
Theres no way i'm getting this spoiled, so I ordered tickets weeks in advanced and went with my gf to the movies at 2:30 am and loved every minute and cried and I know that this movie touched everyones heart man.
It’s Andrew Garfield 🤐
Nothing will beat watching this movie in theaters opening night
Tobey and Andrew were awesome in that movie broo
I am only watching "no way home" because of Andrew Garfield because he is the best spiderman.
You could’ve said ant man
*SPOILER WARNING*                                           7:52  ZENDAYA'S FACE IS MINE RIP AUNT MAY  WE WILL MISS YOU
I love how they avoided talking about spoilers by telling jokes
"Being in a superhero movie comes with great contractual liability."   Best possible comeback to Kimmel😂
You missing doc ock and the lizard
Jimmy: * asking about the film * Tom: * trying not to spoil anything * *Just don't talk to me. Speak to these guys* 😅
Watched it yesterday and OH MY GOD😭
Honestly, they shouldnt have allowed Tom in an interview before the release
i wonder if the cast needs to take a training course on how to not spoil the movie and how to keep tom from spoiling the movie
SPOILER ALERT:  Seeing the three Spider-men in action together was A DREAM. But Aunt May´s death just broke me, not just because the character died (obviously that too) but because it happened in a very tragic way and making us believe she was fine and just needed to catch her breath. Marisa Tomei did a fantastic and heartbreaking job
Tom and Benedict wearing same colour outfit, the uncle and nephew vibe!
I was crying in the theater watching the movie. Doesn’t happen very often watching an MCU movie
I bet Tom is like “I’m never coming on his show again.”
Necesito edits y fotos en HD de Tom con éste traje🥺🥺
Jacobs laugh is hilarious
This movie surpassed my expectations
Cool
I hope they revamp XMen and F4 with this same energy… or more 🤷🏾‍♂️
NO WAY HOME IS ONE OF THE BEST MARVEL MOVIES EVER
I love Toms hair so much omg
Gosh Benedict is handsome, por dios
6:35 jimmy: Tobey Maguire Tom: yes  😂😂😂
Took me a minute to realise Who the bald dude was
Spidey is my all-time fav movie...
Now thats acting 💥💥
yes. it happened
I was see the movie, and I see this interview again I laughing see they so nervous when jimmy say toby meguire, andrew garfield, go ahead.. 😂😂
6:39- 6:40 : they all thought that Tobey and Andrew would have a surprise reveal lmao 😂😂  Benedict’s reaction is killing me 😂💀😂💀
I will say nothing about this movie  Because I don't need to, it was perfect
They did kind of spoil the money shot on the 3 villains jumping towards Spider-Man
6:36 the moment tom almost had a mini heart attack 😳 ❤
Haha wonderful
Tom Holland is just the character in the movie😏both impatient
so today in a Dolby theater. FREAKING AWESOME
OH MY GOD THIS MOVIE WAS INSANE! I won’t ruin the experience by spoiling anything but this movie was a roller coaster of emotions to say the least!
You people will be pleased.
Law Roach is worth every penny. Zendaya always looks like a million bucks.
NO ITS ant man
Having so many interviews without tobey And Andrew it's so disrespectful in my personal opinion at certain point
Tom: *spoils No Way Home* Bennedict: (sigh) Here we go again… *starts casting the forget everything spell*
It's shocking he actually kept I secret
This is such a funny interview 🤣🤣🤣 they way they just look at each other not trying to spoil it
I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. I'm a fan now.
without tobey = trash 0/10⭐
i saw it today and I LOVED IT.  SPOLIER!!! I CRIED WHEN MAY DIED THO
aunt may dies
After watching the movie. Man they tried their best to hide spoilers💀
After watching the movie I can believe they still didn't spoil it
Two things this video help me realize. That Tom talks a lot in the movies as well as in real life. And that it was hard to say goodbye to Tobey one more time as Spider-Man 😢😢😢 Tobey you’re the OG spider if you ever see this
Like from 10 hours from now, I should’ve been at the movies watching Spider-Man NWN, and now I have to wait longer to watch this movie.. it’s a shame
7:11 Jimmy has never said something that was so true💀
After watching i can confirm this is the greatest MCU movie and its not close
4:48 Just the look Benedict is giving Tom as he speaks is priceless
I just watched no way home last night, yes Tobey and Andrew return as Peter.
Kind of shitty that Zendaya was asked no questions by the host and was only included in the dialogue when the other cast members made an effort to include her. Wish Kimmy would have said something to her, like this it is cringe to watch especially since she is right there next to him.
I watched it last its is the best of the best move damn marvel you out do yourself
Not even one of the best marvel movies but one of the best movies all time
I’d be nervous about spoiling anything
For a moment when they showed 2 "interns" cleaning the mess at the wizard santorium, I thought the tall kid with the glasses was Harry Potter. ^^
I’m going at 4:30 I can’t wait
It looks like Zendaya is wearing toilet paper
Oh no they found out LOL
I am so happy to see all three spiderman work together
Aunt May dies
Kevin to Benedict go with little spoiler king tom
So can we see a interview with all 3 now?!?!
"Expect dissapointment and you won't get dissapointed"
Can't believe the green goblin killed off aunt may. But it was awesome having tobey and Andrew in it.
8:03 they just turn 😂
Jesus loves you so much !!!! I hope you have a blessed day!!!
shame on u MIT, it's all because of you !!
Why does Benedict Look Like Zlatan
This was the best kept/worst kept secret of all movie time but absolutely loved the movie
Very great boost this year
three Spider-Man’s in one movie 😁
I was laughing at this so hard.  OMG, I want to enter the showbiz.  I watched the movie, cried.
This movie was incredible! AGAIN DO NOT POST SPOILERS IN THE COMMENTS 🚨 🚨 🚨
I'm watching this without having watched the movie. I've scrolled a little through the comments and am happy that I haven't been spoiled 😂 even though I shouldn't be in the comments section : )
Well this makes it even funnier now
Tom's suit........is that????????
Lol Jimmy as Kraven the Hunter would be would be hilarious... Given how he reacts animals on his show
Way better than the Eternals!
Movie is fuckin amazing
I’ve seen it two times but I am not going give any spoilers…still …Toby and Andrew were awesome
I can’t believe Jimmy actually ask them about that extended trailer lol look how awkward they look 😅
I’m going to watch it today !!😆❤️
The movie was fantastic! Loved every minute of it for sure one of the greatest Spider-Man stories
Guys its actually ant man punching the lizard im sorry :(
It was very sad to see aunt may death  due to the green goblin .Toby and andrew both are in the movie.
Toby Maguire fit for spiderman ..... 👍👍👍👍 Always respect for 123 for 👌 that's movie amezing...
Tomby is the best
They really got the jokes of Jimmy about "on the set" and "wrap party" 😂😂
Honestly one of the greatest superhero movies I have ever watched
why zendaya is in the couch and benedict is in the back
Benedict from babysitting tom for not spoilling to actually film a movie together with tom automatically babysitting him again 😂
No one even believes Jimmy's laugh. And he wants to be in a marvel movie?
Tom: It's funny, I've been bumping into them a lot recently ... Jimmy: On THE SET? Tom: I'd bump into them at parties ... Jimmy: WRAP PARTY?  😂😂😂
You just missed venom and doc ock
Just finished watching the film.. Man that was the best spidey film
Aunty may is dead
Ned is so high
I find it much more funnier when you see this video after you watch the movie.
This interview is so cringe once you have seen the movie 😂😁
Jimmy's laugh is so annoying
After the disaster that was shang chi  marvel really made up for it with Spiderman no way home
Little did they know 😉
That was actually ant man who punched the lizard
Whos here after watching the movie
confirmed.
Tom would be a good joker.
Why is he bald tho ?
If Jimmy Kimmel is cast as kraven the Hunter I’ll never forgive marvel
Andrew : this is hard! Ive never worked as a team before! Tobey : me either! Tom : its ok! I know how to work in a team! Tobey : you do? Tom : yes! Im one of the avengers! Tobey/Andrew : really? (Smiling, happy) Tom : yes! Tobey : what is that? Is it a band? Tom : 😐   IM DYINGGG😭😭
After watching no way home  everyone know that  that wasn't punch that was kick 😆😆😆😆
I got anxious when tom was saying "Three generations of-" I was thinking he'd accidentally spoil something HAHAHA
7:14 jimmy has such severe Trump Derangement Syndrome that even during spider man he talks about politics and spews bullshit about an "insurrection" lol
I dont undedrstand there r stupid people writing spoilers in the comment. What do u gain from that?
not just Tobey and Andrew charlie cox too!
i watched no way home in cinema its awesome
2:54 all the babies lookig at daddy to come up with a reason💀😭
A bird😂
I feel like Ned is going to be the next villain. He has the power to do magic now and since he forgot who Peter Parker was, he may fight Spider-Man in the next movie.
Why do you think villians are allowed to travel multiverse but spidermans are not🤷‍♂
I watched the movie and  a seagull?
Ned: I sometimes get tingling in my hand  Also ned: opens portal
If I could only drop the picture of them here
i’ve allready seen the movie :)
This movie, more than anything, felt like a love letter to all Spiderman fans. Definitely my favourite Marvel movie now
It's totally unfair with Tobie and Andrew are not part of promotion... Marvel policy   are worst.... You can't demolish the rights of a person by money or threats or contract
Benedict is brown as a nut.
The super senior Benedict taking a back seat, is just a pure respectful gesture towards the fact that the movie is all about 🕸️Spider🕷️Man🕸️
Just finished watching the movie and it was great
I can't imagine what would Tom spoil if Benedict was not there 😂
I love the the way they are so careful with their words. Its very difficult for you guys. PS - Just watched the movie.
Jimmy marvel is known for digitally removing characters from trailers   Tom: really?   had me ded🤣🤣🤣
This movie is amazing, go watch it asap. This whole trilogy  has been the true origin story of spiderman
for people who've already watched it                  THE INTRO FOR TOBEY AND ANDREW WAS SICK
The way benedict holds Tom from giving spoilers
Zendaya looks pretty stunning in that white blazer. Almost as if she rejuvenates 80's new wave fashion. I can picture her portrays Retro Girl Melyona.....
Andrew,Toby are in the Movie and Aunt May dies.Also,Green Goblin is the real villain
Thank God Tom didn't spoiled 🥲🥲🥲🤌
it is true. andrew looks too cheeky and old for peter. too lanky even. in fact, he has that feral look, facial hairs not helping. andrew might be better playing a young wolverine or beast in the new -x-men- mutant reboot coming 2024.
end: everyone forget about who is spiderman (even MJ
why do i always forget jacob batalon is bald lol
THEY GAVE UP AT THIS POINT
1:47 thats kraven the hunter i think
You can see them all sweating for those of you who know you know
Just watched the movie. I know who punched him 😂
But doctor strange is a neurosurgeon he could have diagnosed him...
W in the chat guys
One of the best marvel movie 😵
Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield are in the movie. Now you know it :)
Well Craven did get I'm the movie so it could have been Jimmy, who knows
I love this
I watched it already, I highly recommend watching the amazing Spider-Man movies before
Gosh I just watched the movie and LOVED it!!!! Andrew Garfields appearance literally caught in COMPLETE surprise and everyone was clapping and i about pissed my pants I was SOOOOO excited!!!!!!! I LOVED it!!!!! 😆
Kimmel said was right  They met on the set and the wrap party
The best Spider-Man movie ever!!! Just got home from watching it
The movie would have been 1000% better if the audience had no idea they were in it
Tobey comes back and gets stabbed by goblin. Aunt may dies.
The movie was goated and the crowds hype made it so much betterrrrr
06:35 main topic
After watching the movie, we now know what kicked the lizard
Lighting guy: *it’s my time to shine*
The acting in the scene they showed felt VERY stiff. I hope they actors don't act that wooden the entire movie.
Tobey and Andrew
Amazing
spider man cast struggling to not spoil the film for 8 minutes straight
Love how all are watching Tom carefully, so he doesn't spoil lma 😂
Jacob act like he’s the main actor, he’s so annoying he make like he’s in the middle of all
I swear Jimmy's laugh is ehhh enghhh enghhh enghh..
THANK YOU JIMMY FOR SPOILING KRAVEN THE HUNTER .....zzZZZZ
Jimmy stick to these segments and stay away from the political shjt - I like you better this way, it's more authentic.
Yknow what would be great? When you interview the three Spider-Men together next time on your show, make sure to call Andrew "The Werewolf". So like, "Heyyy! It's the werewolf!"
Tom is legit sweating when Jimmy mentioned Tobey and Andrew lol
That was the best movie I’ve watched in a while
I started to think that 2 man who sit behind Tom and Zendaya are sorcerers
It has been a stressful promotion probably but dang, well-deserved not to give away lotsa good stuff. But for sure...deletion confirmed hahaha

Lies
Really? No spoilers by Tom? Something wrong.
I love Magic man Ned
Well….. ;)
6:35 Jimmy: "Tobey Maguire..." Tom: "Yes."
Best Spidey Movie Ever. 😍😍😍
Loved the film gang!
Tom really held it down this time  hat
LIAAARRRRRS BIG NASTY FKN LIARRSSSS
I advise everyone who hasn't seen it to stay away from the internet more so a Spiderman nwh content, more so the comment section. Don't be an idiot.
After jimmy said with ‘great power comes great responsibility’ zendaya gets shocked and then she quickly realises.
andrew,tobey and daredevi are in the new movie…
Explanation flying front flip kick
Both Andrew and Tobey are in the new movie
Zendaya at 3:50
This video title is a spoiler ffs
Looking forward to when Tobey, Andrew and Tom all appear in an interview together
Everyone forgets who spiderman is and who Peter Parker is
SPOLER AHEAD: this trailer with the weird Lizard head movement was heavily commented by fans here in Brazil, and when I watched the movie in the cinema everybody screamed soooo loud in this scene, because we finally could see it without the digital alterations and the theories were right. It was epic.
I hate Jimmy these days.
After watching movie I can say they are awesome actor. They act on movies as well as in promotion (those who see the flim will understand)
did tom hit puberty recently lol?
For anyone who’s feeling down: Romans 8:18 “The pain you’ve been feeling can’t compare to the joy that is coming!” John 3:16 “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.” Whatever is going on right now, have faith, your situation will get better. :) Jesus bless anyone reading this and have a great day!!🥰✨💖
I literally cried at every moment in the movie and audience keep calpping and screaming I WANNA GO BACK IN TIME AND GO TO THE MOVIE AGAINNNNN
omg, pls GET RID of fakeMary Jaine already
Streisand effect. Why even bother
Big spoiler they both come and Matt Mardok also came
Spidey need to iron his shirt
6:42 benedict be like: dont you, Tom. Dont you dare...
Ong one of the greatest movies,but the ending kinda ruined it
Jimmy's questions to them were so sweet and his remarks were absolutely lovely! Loved how he talked about Tobey and Andrew! Can't wait to see his reaction after he seen Spider-Man: No Way Home!
Wait, he said "crap" in the trailer. Tut tut Benedict.
I feel special being a scaffolder 😂
IT HAPPENED! Sorry anyone for the spoiler but Im STOKEDD!!
I genuinely love how Tom has really settled into his position and fame, his relaxed demeanour just shows it
4:48 The way Benedict is looking at Tom like "DONT YOU DARE SON"
This would the most stressful part of being in marvel… I wouldn’t be able to take the pressure of always throwing people off my scent through the entire interview. 😅
2:39 I am brazilian and I loved that haha XD I love being brazilian, I love my country
Benedict is surrounded by kids 😂
See how Benedict was staring HARD at Tom when he was saying  "3 generations of film" and looked relieved after Tom stopped talking 5:13
someone needs to interview Andrew Garfield ASAP
This film must have been the hardest to do for Tom Holland with all the easy potential spoilers in it.
I will watch this Goddamn movie for the second times next week
Can you imagine being in the most anticipated film of the year, superhero film in 3 years, and you cant even go out and enjoy the press barrage because your inclusion in the film is the worst kept secret in Hollywood, second only to Tom and Zendaya being a couple? Sheesh, so unfair.
Fckk
All the spideys were amazing 👏
Spoiler : in replies
Lmao Tom’s “really?”  🤣
so andrew and tobey wont have any promotion or what haveya for this film?
When they brought up Susan I got excited
The amount of spoilers in the comments are too damn high xd
“When being in a superhero movie comes great contractual liability”
why do strange need to cast spell that would make zendaya forget tom
“PLEASE put me in this movie for God’s sake!!!” LMAOO
"Avengers? That's great. What is that?"  Lmao that was too funny
dream come true movie!!! seen it last night i just wish stan lee was alive to see it too
After watching the movie I find this interview  so funny and interesting 😂
So amazing
Lol  I saw the NWH film lol Tobey and Andrew are innit lmao if u want to know
What they didn’t show is Kevin Feige in the corner pointing a gun at Tom saying; “Go ahead Tom ruin my movie”
American hosts are a bunch of bullocks, graham Norton is the best interviewer
7:12 he wasnt even kidding, thats a fact
Watched it in IMAX last night early show in Toronto. Words cannot express the emotions, the nostalgia, the plot. I won't spoil anything but it delivers beyond anything imagined. They did the character justice!
They're in it. Went to a premiere last night. Great film.
it was the best movie ever
Jimmy is insufferable
Tobey was spider man. End of story. Moving on
Andrew Garfield is the Werewolf. He is the werewolf.
Tobey the real Spider-Man
I just have watched the movie and it was awesome. Also Tom actually spoiled a huge detail in this interview if you notice ;)
Spoilerman
The one who kick lizard was another Spiderman called Tobey or Andrew
This interview is so satisfying to watch now that No Way Home is released🤣
They were so good at dodging questions I'm impressed
I saw this movie on thursday
man I don't like it that I can't enjoy a interview with possible spoilers especially for this one. Interviewers try so hard these days to spoil the plot even though some stuff is already leaked just leave it. I'm so lucky I've seen the movie b4 I've seen the interviews.
anyone can appreciate Jacob's  natural laugh ?
Valeu Marvel Brasil, gerando pauta pros Gringos
benedict looks so done when jimmy said "go ahead" I CAN'T LMAOOOOO
loved benedict been always a anti- spoiler to tom.😆
Capitol style insurrection if they are not in this movie, you know that Right?
Toby and Andrew were in the movie. And venom just in the post credit and left a part of the symbiote behind in the mcu
“With great power comes great responsibility” 😭
Spiderman No way Home is gold, it is better than Endgame
Bhagwan se toh daro 🙂
just watched the movie, I can safely say that Tobey and Andrew DO NOT make an appearance... sorry guys.
We will look back and say this was the greatest  Spider-Man roll out of all time!
Benedict and Tom's matching outfits look so goood lol
Yeah they both are in the film
I Think every1 knows will be 3 spider man in the movie. Big thanks to my country to give spoiler to entire world btw.
Benedict looks like he is about to have a heart attack
Gonna watch for Tobey... Those movies take me back in my days.... ♥
benedict was so good in the power of the dog... my favourite movie in 2021
*Strange to me* "Do you know Peter Parker who's Spiderman?" Me "yes" *Points at Tom*  "Is that him?" Me "No" *Points at Andrew* "Is that him?" Me "No" *Points at Tobey* "Is that him?" Me "Yes"
I don't like the host
With great power comes great responsibility.....  And with great superhero movie comes great contaratual liability 🤣🤣🤣
SPOILERS!! GO DOWN IF YOU ALREADY SAW IT                                 you sure?                     OK LAST CHANCE                                       anyways tobey and andrew were in the movie and i wonder what andrew is gonna say now, now that he is in the movie
Damn Benedict laying it thick on this one
Tobey and andrew will die. Gwayne from another universe will be also there as a villain. In post credit scene we see iron Man with red scull
This aged well
Title should be Benedict babysitting Marvel babies.
I need to use some deodrant 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭 I cried .
I've watched the movie, anything that u want to know ask me .... :v
Funny that they didn't mention that it could have been Antman, which is why they can't see who hit the Lizard.
Ye marvel wale Kitna jhoot bholty hai Toby and Andrew k bare me
6:38 bandict looked so pissed
When Benedict said the lizard needed to use deodorant 😂😂
TM is not the original Spiderman, he is Ironman Junior. Tobey ad Andrew are the original Spiderman.
VAI BRASIL PORRA
So glad I watched the movie before watching any of these interviews or even trailers 🙏🏽
CRAVEN!!??
IMDB has now been changed to show Tobey and Andrew are in the film. It is not a secret anymore lol
Yes they are
Marvel to cast: if they ever bring up that trailer, just start speaking all at once.
@6:40 Benedict face to jimmy is priceless! its like he's thinking... dude... wtf man hahah
You censor the word "crap"? Wow...
Tobey Is Forever Spiderman For Me
The way Tom looked back at Benedict helplessly when Jimmy asked about Tobey & Andrew😂😂🤣🤣
How did you get this clip??
Maybe we should ask them, is Tom hardy gonna be in the movie
Benedict Cumberbatch was carrying this interview. Clearly these kids need a babysitter
Tovey and Andrew are in the film
BEST FILM EVER
look at these liars lmao
Look at Benedicts face when Jimmy asked about Tobey and Andrew “ oh you son of a . . “
You wanna know a secret????????? Hahahahahahahaha omg <3
go see the movie everyone, you won’t regret it ;)
Tom was right.just watch the movie guys no need to ask. Its worth ur time if ur a spiderman fan :p
Andrew,tobey, daredevil, venom all are in the movie
"I wanna know for them!" Well Jimmy....watch the movie!
Hehe I can confirm it's him
I need to give Tom Holland an award because this is the first time he doesn't give us spoilers hahahha
Watched the movie earlier today, a day before its official release at the Chinese Theater,  Hollywood. WOW.. incredible movie.
I watched it earlier and IT WAS SOOOOOOO GOOOOOOD!!!!! 100/10.
Just saw No Way Home and I find it hilarious that they go on Jimmy Kimmel to advertise it, cause there’s no chance in hell I would have ever watched this interview beforehand. It’s like stepping around glass while barefoot and not sure if you’re gonna get cut or not
just watched it and my god this was the greatest movie
Dude, even if they say 3 spiderman will come out, it will make me more and more excited...
The kick is Tobey kicking lizard in the face and yes I saw the movie already.
Spiderman no way home is one of the greatest movies that MCU has ever produced. I rated this movie 10 out of 10!
0:28 what did mj say? Can anyone help?
Nice acting HAHAHAHAA But anyway Thankyou for the great movies before end 2021.
2:39 andrew kicked him
The audacity to lie to the world without blinking. How dare they kept it a secret to enhance my viewing experience.  Also loved matt Murdoch appearance
Spoiler warning ⛔️         They are 100% in it for sure at the end I watch it it was amazing
i just got home from watching the movie and i’m so glad i didn’t see this before hand 🤣🤣 jimmy really showed them that clip 😭😭
After watching the movie this is funny that how they are hiding the secret 🤣
Man that would suck if the 2 spider man was only a side character
Bird that was actually a req good excuse to come up with on the spot...but good try, lizard is getting kicked in the face by Andrew
The ending was sad
deodorant ahahahahahaha
no doubt jimmy is a smart interviewer 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm so happy I didn't watch this part of the interview before I watched the movie.
I've seen the movie, it released in my country yesterday.......and oh boy isn't it freaking mind blowing. IT HAS EVERYTHING YOU CAN THINK OF. EVERYTHING. ALL MEMES AND CHARACTERS, EVERYTHING.
Garbage movie but those two are legends. Anyone who defends this movie has failed in real life.
I saw the movie guys they r gonna appear.
I saw the movie guys they r gonna appear.
Trailer segment aged really well lmao
2:46  It's a bird! It's a plane No it's John Cena!!!!!
Can’t friggin stop thinking about this movie…this Spider-Man movie is magical…🤯🤯🤯
6:34 it's hilarious....
5:12 it's hilarious how they look at tom.. Don't spoil anything please...
7:53 this guy already watched it.
This is so funny 😂
We all know that Tobey Maguire is the best spiderman actor.
i seen the movie today tobey maguire and andrew garfield where in the movie it was so amazing when they showed up
I knew they looked shook when he asked about the trio lol
JIMMY. BRING ALL THREE OF THEM TOGETHER. PLEASE.
This movie was so good, thank you all who made this happen. Was not disappointed. Ending made me cry though
They're in it guy I saw it yesterday
Well looks like we were right about someone punching the lizard
Benedict😭💕💕💕
“Yon know there’s gonna be like a capitol style insurrection if they’re not in this movie, right?” They know Jimmy, they know.
Jacob's laugh is hilarious 😂
Good job Jimmy! Asking the best questions haha
2:18 For such good actors they really can't act clueless, can they?
Now that I’ve seen it I can say it’s one of the greatest movies ever made. It made me cry several times real tears. It surpassed every expectation possible
It just occurred to me how weird its going to feel when every one involved with the movie openly talks about Tobey and Andrew's involvement a while after its released.
SCAFFOLD THE INCREDIBLE POLE. i would watch that show/movie lmao
shout out to the camera man and director!! good follow. I would have had a heart attack.
anyone just see the movie?😫
Wow came back to the interview and Andrew hits Lizard 😭👏
i saw the movie
Spoiler don’t click!!!!         ANDREW AND TOBY WERE AMAZING IN THIS MOVIE AND THE THREE WORKED TOGETHER SO WELL
Seen the movie tonight! IT WAS TOTALLY WORTH THE HYPE!
I know now! Who’s seen the movie 👋
movie was phenomenal
Movie was great
wow, did they really forget to edit out lizard being punched or was it intentional?
That was a strong a** bird 🐦 LOL This is hilarious 😂
Spiderman no way home was EPIC!!!!
🧐" tingling on my hand", "look at your physician", are you the doctor strange I know?
easy is to get Tom to talk.. kid can't hold anything... not just on this upcoming movie but on every other movie he is in lol
petition for jimmy to actually be casted as Kraven in the mcu
Love that if seen the movie
Who’s here after watching NWH? We all know they’ve done more than bump into each other😏. They’re brothers for life now!
Movie's amazing asf 🔥
Just seen NWH and it’s a classic. Top 5 mcu movie
“Great Spoiler comes with great lawsuit"
best spider-man movie of ALL time
tom’s accent has me running circles-
tom did a great job hiding everything proud of u bud
Andrew "I'm not in the movie" Garfield.
Just got done watching the movie it was great I can't believe aunt may die but overall it kinda was expected because peter needed to learn about responsibility in this trilogy so it had to happen
Good job Peter 1 👍
Tom is really trying to be good
Wait, what happen with Ned , he ... bald!
Tom a lil sus
Tom an opp just by the way he talks and acts during a jimmy show
2:35 that scene though🕷️🕷️🕷️
Anyone else scrolling through the comments to see if there is any time stamp about the title of the video 😂, well….you are not alone😅😁✌️
I wish they make one more
Dude Toby and Andrew were great in this movie
Ned was right when he says his grandma told him that magic/wizardry runs in his family
Poor Tom he got panicked when Jimmy asked bout who else is in the movie😆🤲
PETER PARKER AND PETER PARKER AND PETER PARKER GOOD 😌❤️
Tom is careful for answers now 😂😂😂
Directors: take Benedict with Tom Holland and others Tom Holland :why Benedict Directors: I don't believe you can't say anything something like spoiling to the movie so Benedict will be noticing all of them .
And thank goodness there will be no insurrection!!!
whose the bald asian nerd?
Having just seen the movie, it’s so disappointing that the three spidermen are not actually in the film.
cant wait to see it tomorrow
kinda feel bad cuz we all know tobey and andrew are in it, and they didnt get to go to the red carpet premiere and talk shows and interviews like this.
Finally Benedict Cumberbatch is here
Bhai sabh you got the clue I just watched the movie it's true
Hi how are you doing
6:38 LMAO IF U LOOK AT HIS FACE bro was scared for his life
Just saw the movie yesterday it was awesome
So Ned is preparing for a villain role as I heard some rumours.
Ned foreshadowing
Eddie left a tip of goo
*best. movie. ever.*
Liars
There not in it L
Spoiler!     Theater went nuts when Andrew and Tobey came through the portal
It’s a beauty of a movie. I finally saw the silver lining to having 3 people take the role of Spider-Man. Incredible, magical.
Good think Hulk wasnt in this...mark and tom in same room lol
5:20 it’s crazy hearing 2004 referred to as “back in the day”
Those of us who watched this in cinemas at the start of the week before it hit the US, we know whats up 👀 Best movie of the year
igbn
Best movie ever
Whos here after you saw the movie😂😂
So it turned true in the actual movie. Great 👍👍
Those 4 cast members look like they're trying REALLY hard not to let slip anything... If Tobey and Andrew ARE in the new movie and they had to keep a lid on it, I imagine this is exactly what they'd look like trying to be quite about that!
Spoiler alert. Ned shaved his head because in the Asian universe, he is the Asian Wilson Fisk!!
The movie was amazing
No way home cast on the rumor, alright time to see Any Slight difference in Tom's momentum or reaction
All 3 of spider mans are in the movie
don’t look at the cast of the movie
o trailer do brasil aparecendo kkkkk eh nois
they were true best spiderman film ever daredevil as well
pqp tinha que ser no Basil kkkkkkk
6:45 Look of: "Don´t say something stupid, kid." Gotta love Benedict. xD
Knowing now that they’re in it, this is so much better
Oh nice, Kraven is going to be in Spider-man No Way Home. Kraven is my favourite Spider-man villain. I can't believe people has forgotten my boy Kraven.
My favorite quote of 2021 " Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, Go Ahead" lmfao
Brasileiros são foda 🤘🏼
spoiler alert---------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                               go see the movie for yourself!
I'm watching this after I completed watching no way home and still when tom speaks my heart just skips a beat . Lmao
2:39 He didnt get punhed thats for sure
At this point, they will have to give Kimmel the goddamn Kraven role when they include him
Lol imagine living in America where the movie hasn't come out yet...
Great interview
How did you guys do it?
uhm i guess you guys forgot peter and andrew somewhere...uhm guys yep.
Every question Jimmy asked was true like tom was like Jimmy have u already watched movie before premier?? 🤣
All 3 Spiderman in the movie
I have seen the movie! It's a dream come true thing. Now I won't spoil it for people because with great power comes great responsibility  but I'd say this, you are gonna get all of the answers jimmy asked the cast and trust me, you are gonna be amazed and may even cry :)
Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield are definitely in it.
This is my favorite Tom Holland hair
Andrew Garfield :"I am not the WEREWOLF"  December 16th : "Hold My BEER"
The fact that guests dont need masks but the audience does tells you all u need to know.
Jimmy is a very good interviewer
“Three generations of cinema” Of Spiderman, Tom, not cinema. Thats a huge difference😅
When you realize the only reason they casted Benedict cucumber in this movie is only for him to be with tom in these interviews so he can stop tom from spoling😁
watching this a day after seeing nwh got me sitting here like 😏😏
I'm sooo happy that all they said about other Spider-men was a lie and Tobey and Andrew actually showed up
It’s fun to watch them try not to give any spolier by being idiots.
well-
I love Dc but damn Marvel is just to good.. and i am really happy because they deserve it !
i think when the lizard gets hit its actually miles morales because he can turn invisible??
Господи sony и так все слили, так что им не зачем секретничить. Фильм из-за этого не оставил никаких ожиданий все до фильма знали что там будет 3 паука и сорвиголова
I love how Benedict and Zendaya actually spoiled the return of Tobey and Andrew in this interview. Oh the irony😂😂
You haven’t seen it? 👀
Pls give them Oscar for doing acting in this interview
Amazing Super Wonderful
All spider man in one movie
Spider alert: continued multiverse ends with venom and continution of this ends with Wanda introduction
this has to be one of the worst interviews they have been to recently, just 70% of the time he is trying to get them to stumble up risking their careers really not a good move.
It's so sad to see aunt may die in this movie
I'm upnext
7:47 Jimmy: With great power comes great responsibility  Benedict: With being in a superhero film comes great contractual liability This killed me, Benedict is so quick and witty
benedict eyes just stuck on hollland
Bruhhhhh Benedict keep looking at Tom menacingly like "Don't you dare!"
Kraven?
Look at Tom, he just wanna spill out that both Tobey and Andrew are there but cant. The movie is a MASTERPIECE, prolly the best Marvel Movie I have ever watched. Tom is God's favourite.
Tobey and andrew are actually in the movie
Tom holland try not to spoilerrr...hahaha
just saw the movie and it was amazing!
I just watch the movie and they (Tobey and Andrew) are in the movie
2:42 I just love Jacob
This is one of the funniest jimmy kimmel videos I’ve seen
I'm surprised how they are this large secret it's real both spiderman are there in movie
They are in the movie guys(Andrew and Tobey)
Jimmy wants to be in the MCU so bad.
nwh>endgame
zendaya facial expression gave em out
Everyone knows it’s ant-man because he’s in every MCU movie
Jimmy cutting off Tom “wrap party”  😂😂😂😂😂 brilliant
Not me being HELLA nervous for Tom after watching the film 💀💀💀
Jimmy would not even be a bad cast for the role of the hunter... He'd just have to bulk a little
I saw they are
There is three Spiderman in this movie I just watched it in a
Lool. This video is wayyy better after watching the movie.😂
Oh Benedict and your marvelous reactions hahaa a TOP NOTCH indeed!!!🙌
Hahahahaha wait till you actually watch the movie and they’re all in it tom tobey andrew
They managed to not reveal anything, kept their mouths shut throughout the whole promotion and tours, props for the mental fortitude. Seems like Tom has learned from his past mistakes.
NOT TOM SAYING YES WHEN HE SAID TOBEY
Good jobs tom u didn't spoiled anything
We know that Benedict was praying for his life when Tom was talking to Jimmy
This makes me think will there ever be a black spiderman (portrayed as miles morales) in the MCU other than the spider verse?
Yes all spidermen are in the movie
i watched the movie today and it is one of the greatest movies ever. i think the audience was cheering and clapping which made the movie more exciting. would definitely watch again but I'm surprised how secretive they all were
This movie is the greatest
The 3 spidermen actors flips and tricks contest would be so good
The way he lied about Andrew and Tobey...
Why there's no Tobey and Andrew there during the interviews? hehehehehe
I am from India,   no way home released in India today 16 December,   it's releasing tomorrow on 17 December in USA   ,      And Surprise is  I saw the movie today  Any one want spoilers -------------😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂   Willem Dafoe - Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha ha ha ha ha ----_----------_------------Ha ha ha ha ha ha aha ha  ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha  Peterrrrrrrrrr  you can't stop me...... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha  ha ha ha ahhh haaaaah  haaa haaa huhhhhhh
Worst late night host.. EVER!!!!!!
Benedict looks fcked up
I love how everyone is seated facing the camera as they should be and Tom is directly facing Jimmy
they are confrimed in the movie btw
Don't worry what u expect is all there 🤣🤣
Green Goblin kills Aunt May with his glider and Andrew Garfield Spider-Man saves MJ from falling and dying, tobeys spiderman saved tom hollands spiderman from killing green goblin and he get stabbed by the goblin for it. Tom Hardys Venom will be next crossover as he’s seen after the credits.
I loved it when Benedict Cumberbatch says with being in a super hero movie comes great contractual liability..
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Waiting for the next line of guests panel 😍😍 for same movie
It's true. They are in Nannas house
IT HAPPENED
They are in the movie
Spoiler warning - there are three Spiderman and someone special of Spiderman is died
Great movie saw it yesterday
I was surprised why no one was posting about No way home....and then I realised, it hasn't released in the West yet! Well, I'm excited for you guys to watch it!! Marvel has truly done it again!!!!
THEY ARE THERE FOR SURE IN INDIA I JUST WATCHED THE MOVIE AND TOBEY AND ANDREW ARE THERE!!!!!! NO CAPP
The best movie
Was great seeing them in it
Andrew can finally take a breath 🤣
They were as convincing as Hilary when she accidentally deleted her emails
If I had watched this before the movie I’d have definitely knew they were coming 150% so glad I went dark on the internet before seeing it made the actual reveal amazing
Seriously oscer de isko koi
The leaks were real and nobody wanted to admit it. If you thought it was a secret you’re just stupid. I saw the leaks before seeing the movie. Everyone and their grandma saw Tony and Andrew coming. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
“You’re here, you’re vaccinated.”  I’m sure glad Spidey is keeping these streets safe from Doc Oc… cron
Thanks spoilers. Luckily I watched the film 1st b4 I watched this interview. 😐
Just watched the Movie, honestly the friendly neighborhood Spiderman took the darkest turn, utterly heartbreaking movie while being a masterpiece
Jimmy:"Tobey maguire, Andrew garfield go ahead" Benedict:"I missed the part where that's my problem"
Them: Oh thank lord no Daredevil questions 😌
I screamed throught the whole movie and I wanna scream more......!!!!!!🤩🤩🤩🤩🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
Awww the claws are CGI this time. I was hoping there would be some element of realism to the props
I’m on the edge of my seat just hoping Tom wouldn’t say anything too bad.
Im SO excited for this movie I’m going to see it tomorrow and I want to scream😍😍😍😍😍😍
5:10 Benedict: don't spoil, don't spoil, don't spoil
They actually are in the movie 🤣
I love tom reaction when Jimmy call name Tobey and Andrew
He said yes on tobey
Hey guys, all spidermen are in it and Aunt May dies after saying with great power comes great responsibility. Tobey gets stabbed in the back by the green goblin but lives.
2:29🇧🇷
Watching this after watching the movie 👀
just watched it earlier, up for spoilers anybody?
I'd rather them not be in the mcu. I never liked Spiderman until Tom Holland played him.
well I have watched nwh today, anyone up for spoilers 😁😂
ahahahh, i love jimmy
All the rumours are true I just saw the movie 😍
tom trying so hard to be independent by not spoiling 😂
I'd like to know how that staircase was fixed.  Did they use their magic stuff like powers or did they find some contractor on the internet.
Esta vez debo felicitar a Tom porque lo hizo bien guardando el secreto de que Tobey y Andrew estarán en la película hasta el final. :) Pero yo confiaba en que sí pasaría!
Spoiler, Tobey and Andrew are in this movie because I watched it today
One like and subscription for the perfect libe in perfect time "with great power, comes great responsibility" 🥰
After watching spider man im laughing so hard with there excuses on who hit the lizard
Btw miles has the ability to be invisible...
The movie’s decent fun. Nothing to rave about but tons of fan service.
With this we can clearly conclude that: . . Jimmy really wants to work in this movie
Zandaya looking like stephen tyler circa 1984
Thats fax
Dude, Benedict is all red😂😂
Sial la jimmy kimmel ni , nk jugak tahu pasal tobey n andrew hahahaa
call  toby macguire, andrew and tom together now
Ned spoiling he's family background.
its andrew punching the lizard
Tom's answers written beforehand.
May dies
They're in the movie btw
JIMMY WAS ACTUALLY FUNNY HERE
40-second one shot then shot-reverse-shot
LMAO THEM TRYING TO COVER IT UP
Who’s here after watching the movie
Anyone noticed Tom is basically wearing what Zendaya wore on Graham Norton??
This film.. this film..
Spoiler:    They’re both in it
Jimmy is on it today
I still find it weird that Ned is actually bald. He’s supposed to be a high school kid…
kinda sucks how they force them to talk about rumours/spoilers. ruins it for everyone
Deodorant 😂
Guys just watched nwh in theatres if you have the chance just watch it in theatres it's worth it won't be able to experience this again if you miss it
Peter 1(Tom) Peter 2(Tobey) Peter 3(Andrew)
The punch came from miles (black Spider-Man). Because In the game he can turn invisible
Benedict, Tom they all knew all along that specific question is coming up for sure, so they were prepared, isn't it obvious?
Kimmel's a total nut job.
Me coming after watched the  movie " i Knowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww"
its hillarious how nervous they were when jimmy mentioned tobey and andrew 😂😂😂
yea saw the first day first show saw three spidermans and now am a happy man
Tobey and Andrew are in the new movie
Jimmy: “did you meet any of those villains?” Tom: “uhhh yeah we made a movie with them”😂😂
I do hate the fact that so many people seem to really be waiting for the movie only for the 2 previous Spider-men. Me, I'd just love the current Spidey to get a proper third movie and not with the villains we've already seen. Andrew didn't even get a third movie, Tobey's one was a bit overcrowded, and now the same thing is happening to Tom's.  But at least he's not done with the role and will hopefully get more solid standalone movies with villains who weren't on screen before. At least by bringing all these bad guys together now they are kinda letting us know that they won't bring the new versions of these guys into MCU again. So that's what I'm hyped for.
They just cant cover it up anymore 😂😂😂
O Brasil sendo o Brasil kkkkkkkk
Once you see the movie, you'd realize how hard and complicated it is to not being able to say anything and hype about the movie and the filming experience. 🙄  Pretty sure everyone in cast can breathe easily now. Like a huge burden had been lifted off their backs. 😅  And yes, please, we shouldn't call them liars. You can't imagine the struggle they went through to deflect these barrage of repeated, and in a way, insensitive/inconsiderate questions from the press (including Kimmel 😏).
Tom could have said Tobey and Andrew were a great inspiration. that's it.
Spoiler man
Tom: Its a bird
“On set?” MANZ RLLY TRYING HIS BEST
I’m not spoiling anything here from India but this was the greatest film of my life. Don’t expect anything less from Marvel.
Who’s here after watching the movie 🙃
2:42 is john cena!!!!!
This is so gooood, u gotta watch the movie.
2:43 actually that was kick 🤣
HOW IS THIS HELPING??
they are in it. toby plays an older version
Just saw the movie. And it's Amazing!!!!!  1000% worth the hype. ❤️❤️❤️
Jimmy casting himself as Kraven the Hunter. HAHAHA
"With great power comes great responsibility"  *TRUE 👀👈TRUE 👉👀* 🤣💀🤣
spoiler alert Tobey and Andrew are in the movie
Tom gave it away when he said "3 generations of cinema. "
After watching the movie, this interview seems funny... You know what I mean..!!! 😉😉😉😉
Having seen the movie... I can understand how much Tom Holland is trying to curb himself from saying how much fun he had working with Tobey and Andrew Garfield!
Best spiderman movie
Where the rumors true hmmmmmm...
Just watched it last night and it’s already my top marvel movie
Who knew when we saw the movies in 2007&2015 are the last movies. Of Andrew and tobeys Spiderman and they would become an emotion
Jacob just couldn't hold it 😂 everytime when Jimmy hit the point, he just bursted out laughing because he just couldn't hold the secret any longer 😂 and yeah, everything you ever wanted, it's all there 🤫😏
This is probably one of the best interviews I’ve seen by Jimmy Kimmel ever, I laughed all the way through it
Brasil cagando com os rolês pra variar kkkk
All three r there
Jimmy: who hit the lizard? Tom: It must be a bird?
Tom wants to tell so bad😂😂😂
so on the set?
bruhh all rumours are true !! ❤️❤️
Liars 😂
Just watched the movie this morning and they are in! The movie was worth the hype
They both are in it😍i just watched it
They made fan theories come true. Worth a watch.
Nearly 20 years before, when I was born🥲
Meh. Batman is better
Who else has anyone been ruined😭
Guys I can confirm that TOBY AND ANDREW ARE IN THE MOVIE!!!!! Coz I just saw it
Benedict is actually so funny but I feel like it goes over the head of Americans
Can confirm everyone you wanna see in the movie is there
I have to give kümmel some respect for this interview he had me chuckling the whole time
I love the way they lie about the lizard getting hit. 🤣
i love when asked about the lizard how they were all talking at the same time nervously trying not to screw this up
My God tom just could never hold his face huh. The moment Jimmy said "Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, go ahead." and he just gasped as if he's actually holding back into saying something risky. His face just says it all LMAO
Benedict is so funny
The Lizard get punched by Sue Storm lol.
Lol it honestly seems like Marvel is threatening their lives to not reveal any info about the other spider mans
Just watched NO WAY HOME!! And…..😂
Anyone after watching the masterpiece??
The way they're hiding it But we know what'll happen in theaters right?          Right?
In my city it has premiered yesterday but i shall wait till 17th to watch it with the rest of marvel fans
Andrew: I'm not the werewolf guys In theatre: waves at us 😐
So when kimmel invite tobey andrew tom at the same time? BRING IT PLEASE!!
Jimmy annoying in this interview
Fake
Tom Holland looks at Benedict Cumberbatch when asked about Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, He was the one who was tasked to stop Tom from spoiling EndGame by Marvel.. IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN...
Maybe that's antman who punch the lizard 😁
Whose here After no way home??😂😂
i saw the film ,,, we got it all wrong,,, there is no hint of what what ever we thought of..... they aren't in this........ yet they managed to make a good movie... dont worry  you go watch it...
Saw the movie today, hats off Tom Holland this time 😂🙌💯
This is easily the best movie of spiderman and also 2021 best movie for me i love this movie so muchhhhhhh
Andrewww you lied
I've honestly gated Zendaya in these movies. And no it was Peter's mess for tampering with the spell.
they did it
Lizard indeed being kicked by spiderman
“Debris from the statue”… SPOILER!
Now every one knows🥳🥳 🌟MARVEL is marvelous 🔥🔥 doesn't disappoint any one
There was a premier in russia yesterday. Guys… i mean… be ready!
WENT TO SEE THIS YESTERDAY IT WAS SO AMAZING
Well, Tobey and Andrew are there.
For GOD so Loved the world that He Gave His One and Only Begotten Son JESUS CHRIST, so that anyone who Believes in Him will not perish but have Eternal Life (John 3:16)
Tobey's there Andrew's there and Aunt May dies also I'm sorry
Just watched the movie
The trailer was not an accident. Only one marvel team edits the trailers, and then sends them out to countries distributors.
“Neither can I”
Yoo they are in the movie just go watch it its super awesome i enjoyed it the crowd reaction was crazy
I am here after watching the movie and I am not going to spoil it
all the theories always turn up right..the latest one abt Ned turning into villain is so sad
Toby Maguire is back as is Andrew, fantastic movie 🎥
They're there
I like the way Jimmy tried to trick them into his theory and the way Benedict looked at Tom answering those tricky questions, just like he would jump in and cover Tom's mouth in time LoL
after watching no way home yesterday, this interview is really hillarious to watch hahahahahha
Gross. Sick of talk-show hosts trying to have a "gotcha" moment with their guests. Here's to having real discussions with actors in the future. Jimmy, get bent.
Just don't talk to me😂😂
TOBEY MAGUIRE ,ANDREW GARFELD ,GO AHEAD ". zendaya and benedict didnt get that or just too strict.
I love how Jimmy is only coaxing Tom because he knows that Tom spoils all the movies 😂 lmao
Today i'm going to watch Spiderman No-Way home
They tried it hide it so much which made people clear about their presence
THEY ARE IN THE FILM
i was crying when i saw andrew save mj when tom cannot save her,it's so sad😭
This is even funnier after you saw the movie 😅
You could just ask them real questions
letsgoooo
This movie is goddamn epic💥💥
Now I know how they feel defending 😂😂😂
jimmy: "tobey maguire...." tom: "YeS"
Tobey and Andrew confirmed ,I seen the movie . Andrew saves Tom's mj
Mannn toms accent is so different in the movie
this is the funniest one they made xD
A mf bird or debris OK and that’s the seal they’re in it cause they couldn’t think of anything else quick enough it’s way too much evidence they’re in it🤣🤣🤣🤣
The way Benedict is paying attention to Tom while he speaks , to make sure he doesn't give out spoilers  hahahaha
spoiler i guess. movie is a 10/10, it has good plot, sad moments, and a guessable mid plot twist, but if you have epilepsy you are gonna die from this film
Everyone missed a golden opportunity to say "That's a stretch, a Mr. Fantastic reference ;)" 3:27
damnnnnnnnnnn
Filipino dude is a 4th wheel
These shows became such a cliche trynna reveal smth from actors instead of asking some interesting facts about filming the movie or their feelings about or any genuine questions.
They in
omg benedict is so nervous when tom talked😂😂
welp
6:30 I'd watch this for atleast 1m times🤣
All this cap imma sue somebody
Great scenes with all the spidermens
It's releasing in India one day before US 😏 I won't spread any spoilers. Or would I ?
I can't wait to watch the movie
The movie is absolutely breathtaking, it's just wonderful to see it how...
Me who have seen the leak: yeah yeah i wonder who kicked him
Bennedict looks pale along the video 😆
When is the premiere of the movie please?
Who's here after what has transpired?
"I wanna know for them."  Jimmy knows how we feel 🙏🏻😢
Venom🤣
Actually I seen the movie and they are in 👑⭐
Poor jimmy, he’s so curious about the movie and these guys are just joking and laughing
What we really want to see is Tom Andrew and Toby on this show together.
YouTube you are my anxiety. I have things to do
**MOVIE WAS FKN TERRIBLE - 2021 KILLED SUPERHEROES** hollywood ruins everything.
Ohh I guess there is no Tobey and Andrew on spiderman..  Those who dont know : 😢 😡 😞  Those who know: 😏 😁 (leaks)
The one time Tom Holland keeps his mouth shut about something, somebody give me an Amen
AH NED IS BALD?
“just don’t talk to me”  THIS IS HIM BEING VERY CAREFUL 😭
Leaks confirm they are both in the movie. That’s all I’m saying. Enjoy, go see it.
A reminder the God loves you and Jesus died for your sins💓
This wasn't even the hole cast what the hell!😠
It's fun watching tom being unease on what words to say next
I feel like marvel tells interviewers to test them 😭😭😭😭
If Tom said something about the movie he shouldn't have don't matter everyone in Europe or spoilering the movie every time I get on yt it's something about spiderman 3
laughing in indonesian
You’re saying to much
SPOILER ALERT!!!!        I watched today and i can confirm that both, Tobey and Andrew are in the movie, it was beautiful...
Im so hyped
This isn't an interview. This is an interrogation. 😭😂
Kitna jhut bologe haramiyo 😂😂
Aye I can't wait til this come out I wanna know If venom and Shang chi go be in it
I hope Miles is in the movie
What is Jimmy is actually in it?! Lol
ned looks like da wok
Goblin just too overpowered 😈
I just saw the movie
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
This was the funniest interview I've ever seen   Kimmel interviews don't really hit too often but this one was a banger
Everyone: making excuses Jacob: AHAHAAH MARVEL MESSED UP SO BAD
1:36 Hahahaha this reminds me of the infinity war/endgame interviews with tom holland and benedict cumberbatch where benedict would talk about ways he makes tom holland shut up
On The Set
can't wait! 😁
Why they all British all of a sudden
Jimmy Kimmel really gotta bring politics into this bruh 🤦‍♂️
Jacob's having the time of his life and I am HERE for it
just admit tom holland that andrew punched lizard i watched the movie in cinemas
1:47 Kraven Kimmel
Watching these vids now are funny, just saw the midnight screening. Perfect 10
they have to keep tom holland as spiderman. He's the best since toby
This doesn't aged well
I'm not even gonna watch the trailers because ima go watch it.
Would love to see alfred molina interview on here
I'm genuinely laughing. Wow an actual good interview.
Tobey and Andrew are in the movie
I feel like Benedict has ptsd from doing interviews w Tom during the build up to infinity war haha
Guys, don’t worry. There’s already spoilers floating around YouTube. In facts, there’s a few right below this video.
Jimmy the hunter
I've just watched the movie and I got to say these interviews are even funnier now that I know what happens. But seriously, go see the movie! It's awesome!
How they kept IT a secret….. I don’t know. Tom had a sniper to his head
People who haven't seen the movie.... DO NOT READ THE COMMENTS
2 Big spoiler 1)Andrew Toby are in the movie 2)ante may dies
Jimmy Kimmel please stop using political slur like capitol insurrection  there is more city got burn
lmaoo
Jimmy- "You know there's going to be a Capital Style Insurrection if they're not in this movie".  Funny part is it's true
Why isn't Tom not telling any secrets
Now we know that the three spiders were at the scene
AUNT MAY DIES + ALL 3 SPIDERMAN ARE IN IT
Godamn it Tom we all know they're in it thanks to you 😡
Wikipedia already ruined this with spoilers
this video was so good
"It's all photoshopped"
Bravo to Sony for the marketing of this film. They planted the seed of the Tobey/Andrew rumours and milked it without ever actually revealing it.
Someone's been watching their trailer breakdowns 🤫
omg as soon as tom starts speaking everybody just stares at him like "you better not spoil anything!!" 😆😆😆
That scene would probably be like, "SPIDERMEN!!!!.....Assemble"
Jimmy is Kraven the house cat.🤣
This entire segment was just Jimmy trying to get Tom to spoil something...anything!
Good thing there in the movie
when toby see the brazil trailer  toby : that's great! what is that?
My friends said if there's no andrew and tobey he gonna burn the theater but turns out the theater never got burned
i hope cgi stan lee was in the cameo
I would 100 percent take jimmy kimmel as kraven vs quiksilver
guys I saw a leaked scene from the movie... I'm just gonna say that this has to be the best movie of the last 2 decades. It probably tops endgame and infinity war, the particular scene I'm talking about.
Watch it be antman thst punched the lizard
They all looked surprised and guilty when Jimmy Kimmel mentioned fantastic 4, especially Tom Holland  🤣🤣
Guys they're back!
these guys are the worst liars ever lol
i love how they arent even hiding it at this point lolll
We just saw it today
Guys from the middle east the trio will happeeennnnn
THE FILM WAS GREAT
Its not rumour yall
AUNT MAY DIES
Jacob's laugh is everything.
I have watched it today. It is everything. I cried. I was in awe. I laughed. Go watch it…….
Jimmy trying so hard to get it out of Tom it's so funny
i know we al waiting to see tobey & andrew , but im also excited on VENOM debuting !
I love Tom and Zendaya so much their my idols.
What’s up with the comments?
I just finished watching Spider-Man: No Way Home in the cinemas from my country. PEOPLE WILL NOT BE READY. THE BEST SPIDER-MAN MOVIE YET!!! Everybody was screaming in the theater, it was awesome!!!
Can’t wait for no way home
I actually want jimmy to play kraven 💀
Just watched it . If you wanna know then ask me
So is zendaya wearing a dress made out of toilet paper?
Can’t wait for Friday
Lol well spoilers are out as of now and I’m staying off Tik tok for sure. However I did find out that all 3 are in it. After finding that out I logged off all social media except YouTube. Don’t want the “how” to be spoiled
It’s always lovely to see Benedict reprise his role as anti-spoiler babysitter.
FOR THE AMERICANS 🇺🇸      Goblin kills Aunt May  Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield are in the movie  Goblin stabs Tobey in the back thankfully doesn’t die  Spidermen cure all the villains and send them back to there own universe  Venon gets sent back in the post credit scene but leaves behind a drop of the symbiont stayed in the MCU therefore teasing Spiderman vs Venom in the next movie😁😁😁  Fully deserved for spoiling Venom 2
He actually didn’t look terrible as kraven lol
The fact that he cussed instead of saying crap makes that line better already.
"Tom Holland Is A Walking Spoiler"
Now that I've seen it, it's amazing how they kept everything under wraps. Kudos to the cast!
I watched the movie last night... I can't believe this movie existed, whatever you guys are hyping up, please triple the hype
OMG I SAW THE MOVIE ALREADY AND RHIS IS SO WEIRD BC I KNOW WHATS HAPPENING
What is that transgender wearing ?
SPOILER:                        it was Andrew
6:36 I love jacobs laugh
this aged well
SPOILER ALERT:       Peter Parker is in the movie.
Look at the size of the soles on Tom's shoes.
I watched the movie now (I'm in Germany). This movie is so well written and nostalgic. You will love it
Man Tom stop talking
The look on Benedict and Jacob's face when Jimmy said, "Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield. Go ahead." LMAAAAAO BENEDICT CANT EVENT BREATHE
How’d so many people watch it today??! It comes out tomorrow!
it was unreal
They’re not even trying to hide it anymore lol
Jimmy is getting better at interrogation and Tom is getting better at limiting his vocab
How Zebdaya is watching tom to make sure he doesn't screw anything🤣🤣
They are inside, great movie
Watched it today. SOOOOOO GOOD. I cried 😝
No Way Home is epic guys..
Benedict sternly starring at Tom to know when he says something that could prompt him to roll out the time stone and reverse time.
The urge to spoil is so strong right now.
Check the leaks they are in the movie its crazy
As someone who has seen the film today,the way Kimmel puts them on the spot is actually kind of rude, he could have asked *so* many better question.
If they only make them as cgi characters i would be left disappointed
I’ve seen the film it’s out in Ireland and it’s brilliant
spoiler     tobey and andrew are in it.
Jimmy better play Kraven the Hunter when he’s introduced
No spoiling the movie for anyone, I’ve already seen the movie and won’t be talking about it for a least a week.
Now everybody knows that tobey and andrew are in the movie it's OFFICIAL yeeey.
confirmed.  can’t wait.
Still can’t believe Ed’s actor uses a wig
There's no denying it anymore after this interview 😂😂
Bro imagine if ned learns to do magic
i mean they all just confirmed Toby and Andrew will be in the movie by literally not saying anything or avoid the question LOL
Who is here after watching the film😆😆
SPOILER: tobey and andrew are in it
Now we know 😯
Italians that have already watched the movie 😌💅🏻
Well😉
Is obviously drax
Man this aged like fine wine
Jacob’s laugh makes me laugh
Jacob Batalon is by far the funniest
They are in it. They just have to be
0:39 I knew he'd say that
Wait for the Statue of Liberty scene :)
Lol Sony going to ban Jimmy Kimmel from ever interviewing there stars now
Just finished watching it in the UK. I can confirm they are both Andrew and tobey there. 👍👍
I still can't fathom the fact that this video is in 720p in late 2021
Dude. Benedict game Jimmy a DEATH. STARE. when he said Tobey and Andrew's names
Benedict is hot as hell 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
2:40 I thought I was the only one that notice that in the trailer😭
I have seen the movie im from europe. (Spoiler)...... Yes they re in it.
"Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield. Go Ahead." Jimmy is just hilarious! Straight to the point. Had the same reaction as Jacob.
I even love how Jimmy is trying to get Tom to slip up! 😂
He’s better at keeping secrets nowadays. I am from Finland so I have already seen the movie. Won’t spoil tho.
The fact that they are so happy and wont say anything that means Tobey & Andrew is in No Way Home !
Benedict!!!😂😂😂😂❤️😅😅😅
I really love how jimmy is just a big fan himself
3:10 i know the actual explanation, he just got some dirt in his eyes
I can't believe I'm saying this, but Jimmy Kimmel was actually funny here
Come on we all khow Tobey and Andrew are in it its so obvious
Yep they are decent movie
I just watched it, Andrew and Toby are in the movie, I wish they would bring the others MJ's too. Anyway, the movie was awesome!
Spoiler:we getting Spider-Man 4 Maximum Carnage Tobey Tom Woody 😱
its so iconic how zendaya is both the only black and female person there
SPOILER WARNING: I saw the movie today and tobey, andrew are in the movie. No joke
Tobey and Andrew are in the film
Spider man :)  it begin your time. Time has come tom you are now ready
The fact people have seen the movie and know all the theory's are pretty much true
Benedict Cumberbatch is only there to keep an eye on them and to make sure they don't spoil the movie.
Anytime Tom talks in these shows, am nervous he reveal a spoiler
who is Benedict talking about at 3:25?
This interview is 100× more amusing after watching the film
Now that I have watched the movie... The phrase "with great power comes great responsibility" hits different :')
Can we just talk about the fact that Sony/Marvel couldnt find it in themselves to release a trailer without stupid edits.
Just watched the movie!! I am speechless, this movie is gonna stay in my mind forever
I have seen leaks there are multiple Spyder man 😏
best no way home interview question "tobey maguire, andrew garfield, go ahead."  best answer "with being in a superhero film, comes great contractual obligation."
It would've been great if they just admitted and brought tobey and andrew in the trailers. We know everyone who watches the movie before us is going to spoil this news all over the internet which we deep down already know is happening.
They could have said “bad character model, it’s VFX, it happens”
Tobey Maguire Andrew  Garfield Go ahead   Tom Holland turns n sees his friend like Yoo  Shhh what are u doing  Tobey Maguire Confirmed
Really looking forward to this, but really wish Zendaya was not in this trilogy. Kind of ruins them for me. Not a fan. bad casting choice.
ive seen the spoilers omg
there are 3 spideys and rumors are true
Man, Tom is really getting more handsome as he grows older.
The way Doctor Strange dabs n cuts spidermans friend 💀🔥🔥
Just watched the movie! Best spiderman movie since SM2
Poor Tom 🤣 he's at the edge of his seat all the time. And Benedict keep his eye on him nervously.
Marvel is the new house of lies. You absolutely cannot say anything when you play in a Marvel movie, just the plot itself.  😬😬😁
The man with no fear is in the movie
This is the first time in a long time I’ve laughed at Jimmy Kimmel. Well done lad
Just few more days everyone, we're gonna be seeing Tobey and Andrew in interviews
Tom's face 6:35 when Jimmy said "Tobey maguire, Andrew garfield, go ahead" just gave everything away😂
welp... those denying's and all those "maybe's" have been proved :DDDD
the puppet arms lookled better than cgi imo
who cares what actors think... they are puppets doing what they're told.... musicians and directors are real artists
Now we know😁
drones
there is Andrew and Toby in the movie
While watching all the three clips of the interview I literally had butterflies in my stomach and a wide smile cze I'm so frickin excited!!!!!
this interview is gonna be iconic😭
Brasil soltando spoiler pro mundo kkkkkkk
can anybody tell me how long you have to wait when you pre order the spider man on youutbe?
Jimmy Kimmel as Kraven the Hunter? 🤔 I'll allow it. 😉
Tom said yes
I have tickets for the movie at 6pm on the 17th and i cannot be more excited!
and now the movie is out and all three spidermans are in it
I was more surprised to see someone else in the mid credit scene...
Haha Benedict is _cracking_  up laughing lol it's pretty great. 👍
O Brasil faz tudo 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Bruh the way they were looking at Tom when he talked was like they were about to beat him up if he said the wrong thing
I like how after each question tom looks at benedict for aproval t answer
I surely know why marvel put on Benedict and Tom in one set,,Cause Tom is our nation spoiler lol
Ok I've just seen the movie and it is truuuuuuly a gem, Marvel just doesn't disappoint
I get anxious for everyone else around Tom when he talks about the movie
I love watching this video after seeing the movie in France the 15 december, they’re good
I WANT OLD NED  !
2:42 So they hired john cena for punch lizard?
Spiderman Another Home 2023  10) Miles Morales 9) Mr.Ditkovitch 8) Scorpion 7) Kraven the Hunter 6) Uncle Ben MCU 5) Radio active spider origin 4) Daredevil Matt Murdock 3) Bruce Campbell  2) Harry Osborn 1) Venom
Plot twist Jimmy is actually in Spider-Man NWH😂
You can tell that they are trying to telly you that Tobey & Andrew are in there. NO Spoilers
Saw the movie today. Don’t spoil it people!! I laughed. Cried and cheered!! Wonderful movie
If u know, u know 😉
Ladies and Gentlemen they are back I SEENT IT!!!!
He just want kraven the hunter
There are 3 Spidermen in this movie, sorry for spoiling..
I can watch kimmel asking about the old spidermen all day
Just watched this movie on the 15th.This movie is CRAZY...
Liars
This hits differently after actually watching the movie 🤣
Best video of jimmy ever😂
All i know that andrew kicked lizard
You know what'd be funny: Ned calling Peter and all three of them answering Ned like "I was calling Peter Parker" and they're like "we're all Peter Parker" Like that'd be very funny
Brasil na gringa porra hahahaa
Tobey and Andrew returns to this movie. This is movie is going to be epic in MCU
My back is hurt   You guys will understand when you watch the movie
stop TOBEMY 🤨
Who's back here after seeing the movie 😂🙋‍♂️
*On the Set* ! *Wrap Party* !!! ???  This guy's savage 😂😂
And they in it... Peter peter
Benedict was SWEATING
I watched it they are in the film they appear in a portal to fight the others
1:47 , 2:39 , 3:56 , 6:36 ^ Kimmel actually did what we all wanted👏🏼    6:01 , 6:16 , 7:55 ^ Damn😅
The fact that Benedict keep looking at Tom like "Don't say anything, please!!"
There is certainly going to be Capitol style insurexxtion if they don't have Tobey and Andrew in it.
Tobey and andrew is actually here just photoshopped
They are so bad at trying to keep there secrets 😂
Peter and MJ's hug at 0:15 is the cutest thing ever!!!
THEY ARE IN THE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!  LMAO
It’s so funny how when Tom is in danger of spoiling something he goes super quiet but for the rest of the interview he’s the loudest
Ned the new sorcerer supreme LOL
everything u heard about spiderman so far are true 🙂
Just don't talk to me , speak to these guys
3:13 they turn their heads at the same time lol
5:10 damn Benedict was on him like an eagle😂😂😂
again the wock is here
Their acc in the film
Mmmmm mi gusta, u guys will be very suprised....
I love how they are making lame excuses when they are asked for who punched the lizard
the film is all leaked both of them are in thr movie
SPOILERx        ALL 3 SPIDERMANS ARE IN TGIS MOVIE
Priemer video is leaked, both Tobey and Andrew are present. I wish I would have not seen the spoiler but anyways they're present.
we did it mr stark
Sound is muted for a second there, wonder what one of them let slip out then
WHY ARE THEIR PREMIERES OMFG IT GOT SPOILED FOR ME, PLEASE TELL ME IM NOT THE ONLY ONE
I've never seen them all sweating and trying hard not to spoil the film
Tom was actually bumming into Tobey and Andrew on the Set and had a great time in the Wrap Party 😂
The film is wholesome
🕷🕷🕷
Already watching it and I just wanna say...  Yes.
Jimmy, get Tom, Tobey and Andrew on next week!
Tobey and Andrew is in this movie
Hm i wonder if thats foreshadowing for Ned🤔🤔
Just watched it here in New Zealand. I need you guys to see it so I can talk about this!
I could really feel their intense pressure to not spoil anything for this movie when being asked like that
the way benedict staring down on tom so hard when he speaks lmaoo. that man is stressed
This 'no spoiler' battle is heavier than battle of Stalingrad.
Hit like if you’ve already seen it
Benedict stare at tom 🤣 when he said 3 generations 😜
Guys , leaks from the movie are out it's confirmed tobey and Andrew are in it baby 😎😎😎🔥🔥
After finally seeing them together Tobey Andrew and Tom. Its funny seeing them denying it on interviews before the film and stuff and here haha.
Tobey Maguire wasn't in the movie, it was Chad Maguire and Andrew garfield
they are in the movie. Premiere confirmed it. oh man andrew's not gonna hear the end of this.
Jacob Batalon kept laughing because its all true.
I saw a spoiler and now I know whether there's all 3 spidermen in the movie.
No Jimmy i don’t wanna know! 😂
The way Tom look to the back when Jimmy mentioned tobey and andrew...😂😂😂
“My nana says we have it in our family” Ohoh Ned really might turn evil if marvel Really follows his character from the comics that’s not good
Tom was actually annoyed of the spoiler question of andrew and toby at the end since its been asked multiple times already
"With great power comes great responsibility" while irresponsibly releasing the movie exclusively in theaters. 🤦‍♀️ the irony.    "We can't tell stories about people and then not care about people." - Olivia Munn
Everyone are oscar acting at 2:50
Wierd but I can see Kimmel as kraven dude is tall and got the looks of it 🤔
This movie will make you hate Peter Parker and love them at the same time
It would have been hilarious if the host said"lets welcome toby and andrew" just to watch the surprise on these faces😂
who watched the movie just now? lol
"Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield. Go ahead." "On the set?" "Wrap party?"  Jimmy is not holding back!!!
Lies lies lies that's what you chose,peter.
Nobody gives a flying fk about Andrew, where tf is Tobey
We all know that it’s antman that punched lizard
Just went to see the movie, and can I just say... WOW! Any fan of the marvel stories, specifically Spiderman you will laugh, cry and feel so warm and enjoy an amazing experience! So brilliantly and well made!
I think they relieved now. 2 years keeping secret
This one was the best,,,I laughed so hard 😂🤣,,,after the interview Tom will say did I say anything that I shouldn’t 😳
I love how Benedict keeps an eye on Tom whenever he answers. He be like,“Please tom don't puke any spoiler”😆
cant wait to have tobey, andrew, and tom together
GET THE GUY WHO LEFT THE LIZARD GETTING PUNCHED FOR NO REASON FIRED LMAO THE BIGGEST CLUE EVER
The punching guy is Shah rukh khan.
johny storm: that's the invisible GIRL. sue storm: *"GIRL"?!*
It's a bird  No it's a airplane No It's seagull  No It's fantastic 4  After the film  It's spiderman
it's funny seeing this interview after watching the actual movie
1:49 Now hang on, that poster jimmy got someone to make is literally better than any of the posters for the movie lmao
I have watched the movie.
Tom: "I've actually been recently bumping into them lately-"😊  Jimmy:"on the set😐"   I died bruh lmao
"With being in a superhero film comes contractual liability"  Oh God Benedict is clearly one of the funniest actors
The 3 spidermans are gonna be in the movie guys
ANdrwew tobey
they are  in it     great  whats avengers
Please tell me who's the 6th member of the sinister six?
Jimmy Kimmel is the only genuinely funny late night host imo
Benedict acted like a nervous father as Tom speaks.....
When the Talk show Gets 25 On Trending
Tom and Benedict are always paired in such a way that whenever Tom spoils anything Benedict can stop him 😂.....wahh marvel 😂👏

Me waiting for tom to spoil something
"scaffold the invisible pole" LMAO
Just watched the movie here is spoiler . . . . . . Don't...... dont spoil the movie.
ok tom wore that suit which zendaya wore last week in another show resembling green goblin
Those bastards overseas have been leaking footage all morning and even though I promised I would keep myself out of the loop I watched that footage it is amazing I owe a lot of apologies do people on YouTube who I told were delusional to think that they were going to be in the movie so everybody that I said was delusional you were right I was wrong they are in it and they're not just in it for a few seconds they are in the movie they are main characters
Its real the 3 spidermen will appear i just finished seeing the movie in egypt the movie prmiered todays 15 dec......its reallll and daredevil too appeared
That's definitely Ant-Man
"With being in superhero movie comes great contractual liability" man Benedict Cumberbatch has such a great sense of humor
invisible man? 🤣
"Tobey macguire, Andrew garfield. Go ahead" I mean, I myself can feel the anxiety and the panic of the cast.
tobey and andrew is in the movie!!
jacobs laugh when he showed the lizard clip was so funny
American and other foreign fans: *not spoiled, full of excitement*  Filipino fans: *spoiled, full of frustration*
Peter 1 peter 2 peter 3 thank me later
I just saw the movie, its Good. Some of the rumors are true. The ending Opens up to phase 4 MCU thats about it 😂
7:32 fkin tobey and andrew confrimed!!!
Guys it’s true all 3 of the Spider-Mans come out in no way home, there’s leaks that prove (Watch at your own risk)
Yooo I just got massively spoiled on youTube. A leak of footage is being recommended
The way Jimmy was asking them bunch of questions about everything , legit helped us calm our queries lol.
🕷🕷🕷
They showed up
BROO 3 SPIDERMAN IS REALL!!!
Haha andrew garfield, tobey maguire, charlie cox and tom hardy will be in the movie! If you wanna check it out, go to the "wikipedia", it was just updated yesterday...lol all cast are now mentioned...just several days ago only the 3 villains were updated in the casts...

"With a Great Superhero movie comes Great Contractual Liability" - Benedict Cumberbatch 2021 😂🔥
Best movies spiderman in years
6:36 I just can't 😂😂
i love you Tom
Already watched it this noon premiere here in my country and we knew the obvious ..  But how the story unfold it is still a surprise
And They actually bumped into each other on the set 😂
Maybe miles punched lizzard. Oh. Who am I kidding, it was....
all spidermen are in the movie it already leaked.. its gonna be legendary
i love to see the benedict red face when jimmy asked the other spiderman to tom
well they are in the movie and it was sick
Le me : where is Ashish chanchalani?
2:53-2:56 Benedict low key throwing shade at Jake Gyllenhall
Jimmy showing how much of a loser he is, throwing in the Capital BS
And Yes there are 3 spiderman including Tobey and Andrew, and murdock too, so awesome... i have just watched them in cinema in our country
maybe it was bad editing with the lizard but a hint of truth
why do I feel tom was really uncomfortable here trying not to spoil his knowledge about the movie. thank God benedict's here... else his gonna pop, I mean explode.
Andrew carrying the hype of this movie by denied all the rumours🤣🤣
🕷
The new spiderman film is absolute rubbish. Another rubbish film spat out of Hollywood again. Urrgh.
“You know there’s gonna be like a capitol style insurrection if they’re not in this movie right” DEAD 😂😂😂
Who gives a fart? ~ Yah, Tobey and Andrew are in last half of film.  Meh.
Zendaya is the most Boring and overrated actress in Hollywood
They are in the movie just saw it.
I JUST SEEN THIS MOVIE AND THIS IS THE BEST
That full moon is the Easter egg
AND THEY ARE REALLY IN THE MOVIEEEE
Sheeesh
Benedict trying his best to cover up stuff to avoid Tom talking
No poker face
Tobey and Andrew in there
Its very funny Lizard Being punched by suzan storm 😂😂😂😂😂 Brazil here
Tobey and Andrew are confirmed to watch leaks guys
"Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield. Go ahead" dude no hesitation, just straight up
Every time Tom said something, Benedict looked kind of nervous 😂
Damn I love Benedict!!!
Everyone jokes about marvel having a lazer scope trained on them incase they spoil something, but tom has benedict right behind him ready to tranq dart him in the neck.
😏
They are in it
Aunt may dies
Sorry to spoil but Andrew and Toby are in the film it got spoiled for me if you don’t believe I’ll prove it Tom bet hit by goblin trying to save my and Andrew saves her for redemption and aunt may dies it’s so sad by green goblin and they all team up in the end and take sand electro and lizard out 1 by 1 yeh soz
In the trailer that was John Cena first marvel appearance 😆
This Movie Is All About Toby Maguire! 🔥🌹❤️🙏🏻 3 Celebration Of Cinema 🤔 Tobey!!😀
Well... I already saw leaks from the Movie just awhile ago here on YouTube. Tobey and Andrew is in the movie...
No it was lizard man turning to look at tom Holland spider man cause was so fast he jumped by him.......don't worry tom the don has your back 👍
Oh Kimmel.  You never fail to get your little political jabs in. You're a late night TV host so chill dude. You don't live in the average persons world
oh Andrew you f*cking werewolf you❤️
6:35 the way jacob reacted when jimmy said "tobey and andrew" omfg he's so adorable
After watching the movie, it’s funny to listen to tom’s answer about tobey and andrew 🤣 ..they did a good job to keep it a high level secret lol
Love Benedict's humour man
Zendaya has been wearing an awful lot of gold in these interviews. And she said in several interviews that she has been really strategically picking her outfits…like one of her red carpet dresses had a metal spine down the back that looked like Doc Oc, another outfit she wore in an interview was green and purple for Green Goblin. I know Electro is gold in this film but could this possibly be hinting at something we don’t know anything about yet?
"Invisible girl"... It's "Woman", Jim. Invisible Woman.
Jimmy🤣🤣🤣 i've been looping 6:35 - 8:21 for the passed hours😂 cant wait to finally watch the movie tonight!!
I really do love that Jimmy is channeling the fans
💯confirmed Andrew and Tobey are therein this movie
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂
The amount of times I've heard about this "toothpick rig"...
IF JIMMY DOESNT END UP IN AN MCU MOVIE EVEN ASA CAMEO AT SOME POINT IT WOULD BE A REAL LAZY MOVE and kind of a slap in the face. Jimmy constantly lifts the MCU up. He hypes up these movies, characters, comic books, actors, directors, streaming shows, etc. And never does what some interviewers and hosts do and act as if super hero movies are strictly for children and thee most offensively stereotypical super comic book nerds ONLY and poke fun at them. So the fact that Jimmy is a fan and gets people just as excited as he is.
Why Doc Strange about to turn into RED HULK?
They are there....
Well if Ned don’t die I can totally see Ned getting powers of some sort because that small line is totally something Marvel would try to slip past us a joke but end up being an Easter egg
Don't worry about which Spider-Man is the best they're all in this movie
It was Uncle Ben that punched the lizard.
Now this is what I call an entertaining interview all the best for Spiderman no way home i hope it to become the best movie ever made
I want to go into the movie theater not knowing about Tobey and Andrew ffs
This zendaya girl looks like an addict ..Thank gos she has make up to cover it up
We already saw Tobey and Andrew in leak clip LMAO ANDREW is gonna save MJ     Aunty May is gonna die  TRUST ME
OMFG Zendaya is an ACTUAL Goddess!
HAHAHAHA THEY ARE IN IT LMAO NICE TRY
Tobey and Andrew will appear as spiderman, this is my speculation, there will be three spidermen, to prevent breaking the fourth wall, they'll will be presented as spiderman from two different parallel universes.
John Cena punched the Lizard.
Jimmy Kimmel as Kraven LMAO 😂 would love to see that
They weren't at the premiere so I doubt they are in it
Benedict is RED 😂
So Doctor Strange and bald guy got weird chair and Tom and Zendaya a good one , Nice !
The fact that ever reviewer keeps saying there are things in the film they can't talk about tells us everything.
6:35 Jimmy is a savage and I love it !!
Everyone looked at Tom and Tom looked at his trainer Benedict
They ain’t even saying no lmao, they’re jus saying to wait and see lol
That's real i saw tobey maguire and andrew garfield at movie those scene makes me goosebumps 😭
YOU FOOLED US BUT I'M SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW EHEHEHEHEHEHEHEEHEHEHEHEHEHEH 😭
JIMMY DOES BETTER INVESTIGATION THAN FBI 😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Imagine if Jacob Batalon’s chair broke 😂😂😂😂
We all know Benedict was there to prevent them spoiling the movie
It’s been confirmed kids! Multiple video showing Toby and Andrew sparing and it’s Andrew who saves a falling mj. He needed this redemption
interesting!
Wow Tom was getting Seriously irritated with the constant inquiry  A lot depends in him he knows he’s weak and he doesnt want to let down the Studio 7:35
🆗️🔮
It’s confirmed. Tom Holland said yes right after hearing Toby Maguire @6:38
Why do i feel like i forgot something..... *TOILET ROLL* ... DAMN IT
I’m sorry but I’m having a hard time handling the fact that Jimmy Kimmel had zero respect and went straight ahead with obvious questions that they couldn’t answer and made it all low key annoying for them … we get your point Jimmy… don’t be a pain in the a** … I could tell Benedict (as the oldest actor) was pissed at Jimmy’s moves and choice of questions…
Is it the lighting or are they going more reddish as the interview continues?
Invisible Girl??????
Tobey is the Original Spider-man Andrew is the Amazing Spider-man Tom is the best Spoiler-man
"tobey maguire" Tom: "yes"   LMFAOOO
Jimmy a fool for this
Just came out if theatre , this made me cry so much even endgame didn't made me cry , my favourite is Tobey but this movie made me like Tom Spidey even more , he is awesome he should play spidey for longest time
just got home from the theater heheheh
Actually Tom knew a lot of things about the trailer
Seeing All The Villains Together is gonna be Epic Especially Alfred Molina and Willem Defoe
*cough cough *
Where is Flint marko aka sandman and Curt Conors aka lizard?
Yup it’s confirmed
Spoiler!!      I just watch the movie and yes, Tobey and Andrew is in the movie  One more spoiler maybe this heavy but, Andrew save MJ is real
Jacob's laugh was so Pinoy🤩
I was hearing with too much concentration,may be Tom give something interesting .
Thanks for mentioning the lizard part 😂😂😂
Jacob so much look like Forrest Whitaker.
The greatest Spiderman movie ever rotten tomatoes: 10/10 but     no Stan Lee :(
4:48  Saying "Celebrating three generations of cinema" but only including the villains seem suspicious. You can't celebrate a movie with just the antagonists, the protagonists are surely gonna be in this movie.
I love how Benedict keep laughing at tom trying not to spoil anything lol
All of them are obvious..theyre hiding the secrets.... Of Dumbledore.
That was not a bad looking Kraven
👌🏿🇭🇹⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
They don't have to advertise the movie.
That joke easter egg feels like an actual easter egg to Kraven.
Superhit❤🔥
Let's be honest all if tobey and Andrew are in this movie, than this movie is going to be on fire and it's confirmed that tobey and Andrew are In there so the hype is increasing! 🔥
Crap isnt a bad word
Neds laugh is EVERYTHING
We just ignoring the fact tom said yes right when jimmy said Tobey
3 generation of s-s-s-s cinema 😂😂😂
Miles Morales can go invisible, and it is literally a spiderman movie
Zendaya sucks and irritating to see
WHEN TOM SAID “YES” AFTER HE SAID TOBEY MIGUIRE
The lizard is just checking on Sandman on Electro
I wasn’t even there and I got nervous 😂
obviously the secret character that punched lizard across the air is susan storm (invisible girl) of fantastic four 😂
We knew everyrhing now!
This has me dying lol!!😂
Props to Tom for not just stroking out when Jimmy grilled him.
Somone say Tobey
ZMM on the ASX. 99% down. Sweet investment?
RAN on the ASX. 99% down. Sweet investment?
Tom who?
They forgot Lizard!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3:00 the cringeee when tom realized everyone had a different explanation regarding lizard's head movement
Tom and Zendaya are 1996 babies. They both scrape in as Gen Y (Millenials).
7:35 tom is scared af he might be thinking "stop talkingg omg"
Tobey Maguire Andrew Garfield confirmed in no way home guys❤️ Check Wikipedia! Can’t wait to see my childhood Tobey’s/Bully’s spidey back after 12 years 😱
7:52 benedict was doubting to say what he said for a sec
i love how everyone is just trying to get tom killed😭😭
6:40 that nervous laughter 💀
This is the best Jimmy Kimmel interview ever.
No thomas haden church reference 😤😤
ok this was funny and I don't usually like jimmy
Lmaooooo Benedict Cumberbatchs response was gold.
Jesus... Zendaya looks absolutely stunning 😍
i’m going to see it on opening night and i’m more excited for the fan reactions than the actual movie
BTW AUNT MAY DIES
LAUGH OUT LOUD
7:05 ( on the set ) that shows jimmy has middle eastern genes that's for sure
Not since Endgame have I booked a ticket for Opening night. TICKET BOOKED.
jimmy said there would be an insurrection if the spideys aren’t in it and tom just agreed. gotta mean something
Haha Benedict is a natural comedy genius. I will watch a comedy film where he is the main protagonist 🤣
i cant stand jimmy kimmel
Lmfao he showed the Lizard trailer. Savage
Tobey needs alot more recognition man way more rolls
Benedict is so funny. The invisible pole, the deodorant joke. He’s great. 😂
Wait For it 😆😂
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
They only wrote DrStrange into this movie so Benedict can watch Tom just like in the InfinityWar Promotion Circle 😂😂
Truth is, if Tobey & Andrew isn’t in the movie, it will without a doubt be considered a flop.
Flannel Niko.
2:37 Wow, Jimmy really put them on the spot there 😂😅
Benedict watching Tom like a hawk every time he says something :-D
Now I'm damn sure Andrew and Tobey are there in the movie!!
What does Benedict say at 3:30? Something the incredible???
2:43 Jacob laughed so hard, he probably was thinking how tf editors made such a mistake in official trailer
Look how focused Benedict is to Tom when hes saying something.
So guys i think we have a big hit on the confirmation of the three spidermen. Me, i saw a liberty ad on my tv and it was sponsored by spiderman no way hone, and when it gets to the spiderman part, i legit saw tobey maguires spiderman swinging like in the iconic sam raimi scene. I saw the ad again, but it kinda looks like tom hollands doing the exact same swinging pose like sam raimis
I love how interviewers aren’t even subtle anymore, “Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield. Go ahead.” 😂 at this point if they’re not in the movie it’ll be a huge let down
From everyone saying this is the best movie ever that just confirms Tobey and Andrew because that’s the main thing we all wanted 🙂💯 CANT WAIT
Bruh everyone’s so excited for green goblin doc ock and electro everyone’s forgetting about lizard and sandman
It's official there are 3 spidermen can't wait to see this.
Jimmy knows everything, he played the game well ahah
"Life is short thing"  "Girl and Boy friend is nothing"  "Mother and father God things"  "Support to everything"❤️❤️
MJ dies, No Tobey, No Andrew. Venom and Matthew murdock appear (not as daredevil). Doc Ock and Venom are the ones that help peter fight Goblin,Sandman and electricro at the end. Doc Ock dies again and Aunt may is the one that says "with great power comes great responsibility"
Who punch lizard hahaha it was a brid
Tbh, lizzard getting punched could be ant man or sum idk lol
"SCOOBY DO-o THIS SH*T"
Wait a sec is that kraven the hunter will he possibly be in no way home as a member of the sinister six 👀
06:37 legendry 🤣😁🔥🔥😎
Is Toby is there in this film
John Cena punched the lizard
"I see you in a bit darlin"
If they are not in this movie, I’m gonna boycott Disney and so will my kids.
2:37 to 2:48 LMAO😂💀💀
I feel like Benedict is going to these interviews just to keep track of Tom. You can see him at times staring HARD at Tom whenever he opens his mouth XD
love the massive one take
*When Jimmy said Tobey McGuire Tom said “yes”*
6:39 look at Benedict Cumberbatch showing zero emotions
The question I want to know is did they finally graduate high school
When jimmy mentions Tobey and Andrew Tom was so happy 6:42
BRAZIL?
they all looked nervous for tom whenever he talks.
You can check wikipedia and yes, they are in the movie
Let's come back to the comments when we all see it
I just realized the kid joke about him having tingling in his hands Is diabetes, and he’s says speak to your physician 😂
Hahaha
Im so pumped to see this on opening night im gonna be wearing my Homemade suit for this
Jacobs laugh is the most fake laugh I’ve ever heard. we all know Tobey and Andrew are in the movie so much eveidence
He didn’t say no
Lmao they straight up lied. Both tobey and andrew are in no way home 💀
At this point, if Tobey and Andrew aren't in this film in some shape or fashion, it'd be the biggest disappointment since Thor: The Dark World lol
When u know there in the movie and there just looking at tom , thinkung u better not aat anything 😂 u love spoiling stuff
Tom: I’ve actually recently been bumping in to them all the ti… Jimmy: ON THE SET!!
Props to Jimmy. He's working for us.
Too bad Variety already confirmed Tobey and Andrew today
Benedict is staring the whole time at tom hahah
ae braseeel
DAMN
Kimmell needs to be slapped...Some how he always tries to make it about himself
o mundo agradecendo aos brasileiros
Awesome!
Benedict got so red when Jimmy mentioned Tobey and Andrew
It's the way I'm feeling nervous just by seeing them getting nervous and trying to play it cool 😂😂😂😂. I couldn't work at Marvel because I'd get fired inmediately trying to keep things to myself
Jimmy wants in this movie.
7:19 CUMBERBATCH'S LAUGH LMFAO
This is like the new Scream movie who is the killer, is it Stu from the 1st film LOL
Anybody want any spoilers about Spider-Man no way home I'll tell you the spoilers Andrew Garfield Tobey Maguire are in the movie Aunt May dies Matt Murdock is Spider-Man's lawyer and that's all I'm going to say
Okay, but I know it's a joke... But come on put Jimmy in the movie.
I love that Benedict laughs the whole way through this <33
Tom Holland’s shoes be like 3 inches thicc in pads 🤡
The second time when jimmy asked if Tom knew them and he started talking, Benadryl was just staring at Tom and rubbing his hands together like he was gonna beat him up for spoiling anything🤣
It’s so weird that as a Taiwanese, we’re having the chance to watch this movie earliest in the world. When I was in the US when the Endgame came out, I have to wait for a few days after my homies back home already watched them.
That trailer:)
Love this interview and cast.♥️♥️ I also hope I get to see Jacob in other independent projects that really showcase him as an actor.<3
it went in the lizard's eye...I mean I've jumped when small debris has went in my eye.
fan theory wym?
SO MUCH LIES, GRRR
Why is Kimmel so bad at interviewing people? Does he not know the risk of hittting the wrong nail on the head?
Sounded like Rickles at 4:10 !
Jimmy was being kinda gross with the pushiness
Jacobs reaction to Jimmy putting Tom on the spot with these up front questions is hilarious 😆
They keep making me change my mind on what to believe 😭😂
This vid is trending atm…I wonder why🤭😂
Scene*
This is the best Kimmel interview I’ve ever seen
Just look at Benedict's face when Tom starts talking about the villains. His face just reads: "You better not say anything spoilery"
Jacob Batalon is such a d-bag.
Tom is so cute🥰
My god tom is looking so handsome with that long hair and that outfit.
lizard punch by bird - tom holland
Yup
This was one of the best Kimmel interviews I've ever seen. I like how he didn't hold back plus it was hilarious
Andrew Garfield Tobey Maguire are in Spider-Man no way home hope everyone has a merry Christmas and a happy New Year
W interview, 🐐 interview even.  Officially one of my favorite interviews of all time 😂😂
This is exciting! I cant wait to watch this!
Jimmy needs to go to the premiere dressed as Kraven.
Soooo...Andrew saves MJ???
The rock off of steroids looks waaayyyy different!!
:Tom: I ran into them-  :Benedict: "No, This is where you ZIP IT the Adult is talking-"
Tobey died
but Brasil does EVERYTHING
At this point everyone will be shocked if they aren’t in it🤣 it’s not really a surprise
we all know Peter Parker is just a Stand User.
*Jimmy:* "There's a lot of things that we obviously can't talk about" *Also Jimmy:* "Who punched Lizard?" "Andrew and Tobey" "ThE WrAp ParTy?"
Jimmy is Craven the hunter
Dayummm. Uncle Benedict with all the zingers!!! He got jokes!!!
I cringed
Tom is trying so hard🤣
Joe Manzagillo or whatever his name is should be Kraven!
go to 4:50
mad respect for jimmy actually bringing this stuff up. Even if it did make the cast a little nervous 👏 o7
I love how well they get along with each other. Jacob is looking really amazing himself. I can't wait to see the film.
I've never seen any of the Tom Spider-Man movies & honestly don't want to. I've see the trailers & 12 seconds into the trailer I could already tell how much there where going to suck! you can never beat the original movies.
There's a reason why Jimmy Kimmel gets MCU panels like this. Because ABC is owned by Disney, and Disney owns Marvel. Same reason explains how talk show hosts could ask them, and Andrew Garfield about other Spider-Men showing up. You really think muil national billion dollar companies would let Fallon or Kimmel asks these questions if they weren't in the movie? Anyways Wikipedia and IMDB confirmed it.
And that is why Jimmy is currently the best late-night host TV has to offer
Tom tries so hard to keep his mouth shut 😆
It’s ridiculously obvious they are in the movie. It’s either terrible secret keeping by Sony or a smokescreen to something else by marvel
Cumberbatch is a pro. Guy gives in 100% in every acting and has to make his co-star don't spoil in every junket.
so tobey and andrew don’t show
6:35 Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield 😂😂😂😇
How can anybody watch this crap??
LOVE Jacob Battalon just CACKLING at all of the spoiler attempts. 😆😅🤣
I know this might mean nothing but is nobody talking about what Ned says in the beginning of the video???
Tom Holland needs to stop trying to be RDJ and just be himself also
Loudest theater scene in all of movie history: Thor Arrives in Wakanda…  Tobey and Andrew in NWH: Hold our beers…
Can't stand this verison of peter and mary jane just sickening.
Ok here is my theory: what if they didn't tell tom about Toby and Andrew? Because they didn't trust him and they were always in customs in the scenes with tom:))) and marvel had to plan 2 separate parties for the movie and keep them apart so tom wouldn't find out:))) just something to think about :))
A villain that might show up in future films... Guy, I'm pretty sure they're talking about Mephisto!!😱😂
Tom is visibly stressed.
zendaya is eww
Jimmy was like you guys have contracts but I don't, now talk
So yeah I read a review and yes they’re in the movie. So you’re welcome LOSERS
tom holland is such a pure person
why is the asian kid bald?
Jimmy: Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, go ahead.  Everyone: *laughs  Benedict: So you have chosen death  ._.
John cena has a cameo in here
2:41 Jacob laughing at lizard is the best reaction to spotting mistakes in a trailer ive ever seen
Zendaya was laughing and she didn’t even see it😭
Well, they are in hahaha you liars!
Tobey and Andrew are CONFIRMED according to a critic's post on the internet.
Jesus loves ya and repent Hope you have an amazing Day 😊
2:44 They’re not even trying to hide the fact that we’re gonna see Tobey and Andrew, they make it so obvious
😂😂🤣🤣
😍😍😍awesome♥️♥️♥️
BRAZILL🇧🇷🇧🇷 WE DID IT
Where can I see the full episode
Wait he doesnt say crap 😨 it takes away his old guy cringe
in the trailer, benedict says “crap” instead of “s**t” so like… what else are they hiding???
Tom was sweating
RIP aunt May
Can't wait to see this movie!!    Brings back end game vibes
Tobey McGuire an Andrew will be there whith Tom ..not an spoiler but just sharing , probably a unique Trailer (1 in a millon) that I witness the day that was released....i saw Tobey's face clear and at tall Spider man talking to spidey Tom even  my kids think am crazy or just Marvel playing whith some people's minds .....when I went to review trailer I just saw they were not there any more hmmm great job ...it will sound like UFO story 😁😁😁
"You should talk to your physician" 💀💀💀
Can’t wait for the movie 🎥
Great 👍 cast
6:36 Tobey and Andrew
Right when Jimmy says “Toby..” Tom says “yes”
“Three generations of cinema”👀👀
The only reason they would add Andrew Garfield is so he doesn’t feel left out. His movie of spider man deserved tomato’s thrown
"Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield go ahead" 😂🤣
Daaaaaawg Benedict Cumberbatch is truly a comedian! 😭😭😭🤣🤣😂
2:53 I don't think it's deodorant, it's John Cena!
Love it
EAGERLY waiting to watch the movie...😖
We all know that their in this movie lol the lizard being hit was the biggest reveal
6:36 the "go ahead" is just so funny lol
"There's going to be a capitol style insurrection if those two aren't in the movie."  And Tom nods in agreement 😂😂... Like wtf, yes they are, and if they are not, there's going to be war in the States😂
Most cringe cast
Not even denying it anymore
Scaffold the incredible pole 😂
God bless Jimmy Kimmel should make a movie with Cuba gooding jr
You have the villains, why not have Tobey and Andrew As well?
Anyone notice that when Jimmy said toby maguire Tom Holland immidietly responded with yes
Buh
Jimmy on demon time😭😭😭
Jimmy  we love you  ❤love you ❤love you
Benedict being the only true smart/funny guy here
Doc Ock's arms were actually pupeteered by 4 different people PER ARM.  You do the math.
As a brazilian myself, I say:  You welcome, world.
its funny bc people hate spoilers and here jimmy trying to spoil the movie
In Wikipedia, the Spider-man No Way Home article appears that Tobey and Andrew are included in the cast.
LMAO is it just me or did Toms expression just confirm that Andrew and Tobey are in this movie xD
Jimmy: "Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield" Tom: "who are they?" Jimmy: "when you just a baby they rolled spider-man" lol
Jimmy was guns blazing.
I love her ill drink zendaya bath water and toilet  water after she use da bathroom number 1
i literally can’t wait
“Tobey maguire Andrew Garfield go ahead” 🤣
Being Tom Holland these days and avoiding giving away spoilers must be so stressful lol
i heard that mr ditkovich was going to be kraven the hunter in spiderman 4
I wonder what Tobey Maguire's spiderman is gonna think of PC, brown Mary Jane.
"Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield go ahead" damn Jimmy the whole internet was a little bit more subtle then this
It's brad pitt... He's alive.. from dead pool
Tom was like "who are they?"😂
Umm ... why is Tom the same height as Zendaya?? 0:14
Even if they didn't planned to put TM and AG on the movie, the way fans have been talking about it Marvel would immediately reshoot the movie with the 3 Spidey.
“You know there’s gonna be like a capitol style insurrection when they’re (tobey & andrew) not in this movie” no worries it’s not gonna happen because they’re in the movie 😌
At 6:36 jimmy asks about Toby and Tom says yes quietly🧐
Tom saying have some patience is all you need to know
All I want to see is Tobey Maguire
Tom's British accent tho😂
Please can you just use your imagination for Disney and movies and TV shows that’s the world we live in now
Benedict's laugh at 7:19 is wholesome
You know someone's a theater major when they geek out about the flippin' stage lights, lol.
Tom: I actually been bumping in to them recently   Jimmy : on set ?
They will show up - they didn't deny it!
"You know there's gonna be a capital-styled insurrection if they're not in this movie, right?"  i've never heard a truer true.
Fr fr though the lizard is sneezing because sand got in is nose
Thats why I love Kimmel 1000 times more Than Fallon He actually cares about fans rather than Bootlicking of the guests
AHHHHHHH BENEDICTTTTTT
So, I attended the premiere and guess who else is in the movie!!
Yes aunt may died, and doc oc is still good, yes Toby, and Andrew do appear. Ned uses magic, and in the end everyone forgets who Spider-Man is, all the rumors are true! There it’s done!
no no no no, John Cena punched lizard In the face
i was there for the taping and tom and zendaya talked the entire time during commercial break ! they were so cute
Jimmy: “Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield” Tom: “Yes”
Like how benedict is looking at peter every now and then whenever there's a chance of him spoiling something like "hey be careful here"
Scooby doo this SH*T
They could have shown the john cena one wearing the spiderman suit that made it around the internet a while back
Wow the deoderant one got me XD XD, like the lizard just jumped at someone and then "wait i need to put my smelly armpits off, can someone from the staff give me some deoderant ?!"
Tom: it's a bird Me: Where's the bird?
How is it a bird🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Tobey Maguire: "They love me!"
Looks like doctor strange is actually serious when he says the scooby doo this crap part where as the trailer we saw he smiles while saying it
brasileiros sempre no meio da farofa gerando polêmica com o trailer kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
Jimmy Cuckel DISLIKE 👎👎
He got punched by the invisible spider-man Mile Morales
I can't believe they showed that trailer mishap hahahahahahahaha
I Just Realized it’s Probably Doctor Oto Ovtavius.
Omgg
The one thing I am wondering about is how Spiderman 3 failed because too many villains, and we expect this one to be successful
Did they juts spoil the credits???
you gotta give tom some credit. he’s come a long way when it comes to not spoiling the movies. he’s keeping it together really well w this movie’s promos
Tom: " you're going to the premier aren't you? Have some patience!"  They way I died
Dude for almost 2 years!.... jimmy kimmel has been leading me by the nose making me think he's legit gonna play Kraven. Good job sir.
This feels like watching an interrogation lol
He’s still on his “I’m Kraven” shiii huh!!!
JIMMY IS ON DEMON TIMING 😈
The interviews after the movie gets released all the world , are gonna break the internet. Mark my words.
I still think they just added Benedict for No Way Home to babysit Tom
I really hope they somehow get Jimmy into a future movie as Kraven, even just a quick cameo as a variant or something.
he doesnt call him Peter! he says he isnt peter, so he calls would be same with Andrew, he calls Tobey peter!
I wonder how the spoiler machine Tom Holland managed to avoid leaking spoiler
Benedict Cumberbatch’s laugh after Jimmy’s joke at 7:13 is the best. Plus you can see At 3:47 Tom gets nervous and probably thought Jimmy was going to show the Fan Edit trailer with the other Spider-Men added in.
sony have made it so hard on them keeping it a secret
Jimmy Kimmel is the absolute worst.
Jimmy: "Toby mag..." Tom: "yes."
Yeah they are definitely in this movie
What if he's actually in the movie
Yes they are in the movie.....there I spoiled it..wont say more!
6:35 Jimmy: "Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, go ahead" Benedict: "So you have chosen... death"
The other day, in an interview, Benedict said that his job is to police Tom to prevent spoilers And... He's still doing it, lol 😂🔥🔥😆  04:48 - Pure policing by Benedict 06:37 - everyone's laughing - SEE BENEDICT 06:43 - BENDICT & TOM use telepathy 08:18 - telepathy again  😂
I love how tom says *”i’ve actually recently been bumping into them”* and then jimmy goes *”on the set?”* 😭😭
Jimmy Kimmel to play uncle Ben
I Always Forget That Peter Parker Best Buddy Is Bald In Real Life 🤣🤣🤣
Benedict stressed face when Tom open his mouth and answer are just straight up hilarious
The way Jimmy said "Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield GO AHEAD" 😂😂😂
What if it’s actually vulture Tom refers to when he says it’s a bird 🤔
Nice to see Benedict on Tom Holland Spoiler Prevention duties again
AMC after Toby and Andrew appear 📈
I honestly dont want to see ANY spoilers until I see the film. I want to have a genuine reaction to everything that happens
A little bit too pushy Jimmy
Aw, that's cool. Tobey and Andrew are in it.  I honestly didn't think they would be.  Now, will it actually be good? Let's find out...
Jimmy: I’m dying to know if they’re gonna be all in one movie   Tom: Have some patience 😊
This has got to be the funniest kimmel interview I've seen in a while, and I'm not even that big of a fan of his. He is RELENTLESS in this interview.
“Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield. Go Ahead.” Genuinely laughed
What stupid dialogue. In addition the gal took her vertical blinds and use them as a coat
there should be a jacob batalon laugh compilation!! his laugh just makes my day 🤣❤️
Cant wait when jimmy introducing tobey and andrew, andrew got bullied because he is the wolf🤣
Electro fries Andrew and Holland's web spinners. Toby saves the day. I bet that's what's coming.
fans: if it was not spiderman who punched lizard, then who was it?  Drax: "Well it was me but you didn't noticed because I mastered to stand still and remain invisible!! "
Sorry Jimmy, Aaron Taylor Johnson beat you to Kraven 😂
I have absolutely no doubt for Tobey and Andrew, I just hope we get Emma Stone's Spider-Gwen in the movie and she meets Andrew's Spider-man and they both tell each other it's okay that either of them wasn't able to save their respective partner.
@2:43 - that laugh though..it's like telling us "Oh, someone f^cked up with the editing"
jimmy: Tobey maguire Tom: yes
At 6:38 Benedict looked legit upset that it was even asked... which.... leads me to believe its legit? Good Job on Tom for not breaking haha. Then joking about him seeing them at  a party and he "wishes" they filmed it so they could be cut in zzz....
Damn Jimmy leave Tom alone bruh 😂😂😂😂😂😂
😹😂😂😂
Every time Tom opens his mouth The whole cast staring at him intensely...Love it!
Luv how jacob smiles
Idk why people want to know so bad if they’re in the movie they’re in the movie if not then they’re not
I don't even think Cumberbatch is there for the interview. I think he's there as Holland's wrangler.
the lizard getting hit is a punch through a portal
"It's a bird." No. I think it's John Cena
I’m surprised that they don’t know about Nicholas Hammond….
Where's aunt May, oh well, I guess she was killed.
Wow! Benedict Cumberbatch became RED!
Got to respect jimmy’s level or trolling
If they don’t cast Cody Walker as Human Torch we riot.
Jimmy was determined to get them to slip
I wonder if Jimmy was originally reached out for Kraven….
Jimmy deserves more credit for actually being invested in these interviews and asking interesting questions.
They know the fact they don’t say anything and avoid the question confirms it, right
Jimmy: "Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield? Go ahead!" Tom H: "yes... *takes a deep breath*"  Hmmm okay tom... jimmy almost caught u there 🤔😂🤣😉
6:39 Jimmy Kimmel being straight about it hahahahahaha
I like how they are making up different excuses for the edit because they aren't allowed to say what it is but they know, we know what it is.
Why can't Spiderman be played by an Amer?
The fact that all this started with Jamie Foxx's deleted instagram post. Clever marketing stunt!
"You should talk to your physician" - I love that coming from a physician
Now I actually believe that Andrew and Tobey aren’t in the movie because if they were I’m sure they’d be on the poster and doing interviews with them.
I want to know for them.... my brother, thank you Jimmy!
6:36
I just hope no failed abortions go around thinking their funny spoiling the movie like how they did endgame…
Dammmn gotta love Jimmy. There's like 3 people in the world who could pull off this extremely cynical interview without Sony and Marvel banning them for life and he took real advantage of it.
Jimmy: "tobey maguire ,andrew garfield " go on Tom : "who are they "
Jimmy: Lizard punched by Tom: it's a bird
4:51 three generation of "spi" cinemas😂😭 tom well done.
lmaoo Jimmy not playing games today, I get how he feels though 😂
I am interesting what's gonna be happening in the film Spider Man no way home.
2:42 Jacob sounds like that one cousin who always laughs louder than all your other cousins, or that one Twitch gamer who laughs every time they see a glitch in the game 😂😂😂
The one who punches lizard is superman😂
i like it how tom's trying not to spoil anything by saying: 'i like how we all went joke, joke and then you told the funniest joke.' at 2:59
The scooby doo line feels so much less cringier in the clip
U know, that trailer, I actually said the debris or even sandman looks as tho it hit the lizard. I actually agreed with Jacob a lil. Jimmy is not wasting time with these questions. The fact that Tom said have some patience, I can't wait.
I don't get it? Why everything in his house is frozen?
3:21 i don't agree with jimmy here the guy who punched the lizard is drax
If toney doesn't show up 🤣 this would be wandavision again 🤣
Tom be praying in his head: God please end this suffering
DAMN SPOILERSSSSS
I hate to burst everyone's hopes and expectations but I can confirm Tobey and Andrew ARE NOT in the new Spider man movie.  God bless.
I love how Benedict looks at Tom any time he answers a question lol
What if Jimmy actually comes as kraven
Tom is too innocent 😂
Benedict laugh is so contagious🥰🤩😅🤣 love him😍
Tbh I think Andrew and Tobey won't be in the movie, but probably be in a future Spaiderman film.
I like it how Jimmy is able to joke about the insurrection so casually
Some major foreshadowing with that magic finger comment from Ned
The bald guy is going to have some magical powers watch
You can tell Tom is sweating through this interview not to spoil anything 😂😂😂
7:30  after this you will no doubt hit that like button
The 🦎 was punched by Drax, he mastered the ability to become completely invisible.
3:50 tom and zendaya were like oh  god  please no more leaked scenes.....
The excessive laugh makes this video intolerable.
Bruh I swear if Sony allowed the fandom to think the OG spideys were going to be in this and they’re not, I’m gonna cry lol
Hey Jimmy, Kamala support from her own party was 0% during primaries, is that white nationalists and sexists there too?
Believe it or not but Kevin feige was in the crowd with a sniper pointed at Tom Holland
Whoever caught that in the trailer, good job. I never notice anything. And Jimmy as Kraven is hilarious.
I am tired of seeing Tom Holland's and Zendaya's face...
You’ll get your Tobey and Andrew when you FIX THIS DAMN DOOR
It could just be antman
Tom was periodically looking at bennidict for conformation of going on 🤣
Tobey and Andrew: Spiderman TOM Holland: Spoiler Man
I'm praying to God, no one slips spoilers in this interview
Jimmy: "Tobey Ma..." Tom: "Yes"
You know what’s funny? Jimmy is gonna be in one of these MARVEL movies. He’s doing the whole “Sorry Matt Damon but we’re outta time” move. Hahahahahahaaaa…..
You know Jimmy Works for Disney, too. He’d get in just as much trouble as the rest of them for revealing spoilers.
2:30  Aqui é o Brasil sil sil sil sil
2:44 it’s miles Morales
it's the invisible miles morales
Jimmy:"Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield" me waiting to see them appier from nowhere
Jimmy said it best at this point if they aren't in this movie this movie is gettin boycotted hard lmao
jimmy was the only interviewer who grilled them enough to get the answers thank you jimmy now we know
Tom asked Jimmy if he’s going to the premiere and Then told Jimmy to be patient after Jimmy asked him whether tobey and Andrew are in the movie. They couldn’t be making it anymore obvious
Tom saying have some patience for the premiere basically confirms it.
"Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield... go ahead". Genius
Tobey and Andrew:why are we still here.just to suffer.
Not that these movies are supposed to make sense, but if this Multiverse only brings bad guys in that is stupid. Why not a Multiverse Gandhi Jesus? Why is it always got to be super villains?
Tom pulling a Jeremy runner "who are they" 😂
Tom Holland confirmed
When tom speaks we can see the heart pounting of the other 3 actors
Lets be real Andrew n Tobey are not gonna show up ;-;
SPOILERRR   well they are in it
"Please ... Scooby Doo this sh*t."  Line of the day.
But seriously how in the world is one Spider-Man gonna defeat all those villains... Clearly they have to be in the movie
everyone wants to know but it would be such a shame if it was actually released if the other spidermen were in it
Benedict's literally turning the colour of his jacket
Tom so quite  He is too scare to leaks things like before Spiderman in space
Imagine if andrew and tobey don’t show up. Interviewers are gonna seem like clowns for bring up rumors based in fan service
Jimmy REALLY wants to be a MARVEL villain😂😂😂😂
Go Ahead 😂🤣🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥 👏🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
I will riot if Tobey and Andrew aren’t in the movie!!
i lost count but i am pretty sure jimmy started at least 14 000 605 tries to get Tom to confirm Tobey and Andrew
As a fan I got the gift to have the curiosity to know whether tobey and andrew are in the movie or not That experience will only have once in our life, and that will vanish after the movie releases But that experience is priceless That experience wont have for these people who worked in "no way home" film  So BANG we fans are the luckiest one, not the makers 🤣🤣🤣🤣😎
Tom said "PATIENCE" and Jimmy is in the PREMIER so THEY'RE IN IT?????? He's basically confirming it! 07:32
Tell me the other 2 are in the movie without me they're in the movie
I can't believe Tom didn't give any spoilers 😂😂😭😭.
benedict: hardest interview in lifetime
The reason lizard gets his head knocked is because hawkeye threw a coin at him
you can tell when tom is still sending "help" signals to benedict like all those years prior
I love Cumberbatch
This latest reincarnation of Spider-Man truly sucks.  They should have stopped at Garfield.
By saying wait and found out pretty much confirms it no?
I feel grateful for the fact that I managed to secure a ticket for the movie. This is truly overwhelming.
Jimmy really put all of them in a spot, I loved it 😂😂😂
this couple LITERALLY in the every show
andrew will be in this movie? its a dream come true
A Sony devia contratar os Brasileiros pra serem a critica, ia achar furos rapidinho
The Spider-Man no way home cast is so bad at liying
Does dude have cancer? What's up with the shaved head? Hope he's OK.
How big are Tom's shoes!
Tom sounds extra British in this
That sneak peek makes me even more excited!! Strange is so annoyed lol
Thank you, Marvel Brazil for the lizard video hahaha
I love how you can’t fool jimmy. He is a straight up marvel nerd 😂❤️
Well i haven't seen any spoilers from the red carpet premiere but the fact that when jimmy took the names tobey and andrew, the entire cast looked at "TOM" confirm their presence in the movie😂😂😂😂
WOW TOM TRY HARD TO NOT SPOIL SAYS ITS A FREAKING BIRD LMAO XDXDXD
ஸ்பைடர்-மேன்:நோ வே ஹோம்  தமிழ்
Guess how excited I am to see this movie?         aunt may dies and tells tom holland with great power comes great responsibility while surrounded by a cured Willam Dafoe and Tobey and Andrew
They teased it. They laughed
Why all of you are so excited for this chiledren movie,i don't get it
‘I wanna know for them”- the great words of jimmy Kimmel (for the nerds) WE LOVE YOU JIMMY
The more they talked about the movie, the redder Benedicts face became hahahaha
Hi Spoiler Boy
They’ll be in the movie but not until the 3rd act which is pretty lame
It’s amazing how he does his research and calls them out on this. Other talk show hosts wouldn’t even have known this version of the trailer existed!
I absolutely love how Benedict is just constantly staring at Tom like dont F up
6:36 Kevin Feige cocking his sniper rifle 😂
Sorry Jimmy! Interrogation is no Joke, IT IS a Liability, YOU know this...The HEAT! of SUN-y! need FANS!
Damn why does Zendaya's outfit look so uncomfortable? The string top keeps slipping down, it's making me uncomfortable just watching it!
If I see Tobey and Andrew in this movie, I am going to SCREAM!
Ben C proving he's superior with those comebacks
man i miss this show
Imagine watching the entire movie and realizing that Andrew and Tobey aren't in it. Imagine finding out that all the clues for their existence actually had other explanations.
4:52 he thought he was gonna say something else lolllll spiderman just look at his face
Benedict and Jimmy going head to head for fastest wits in this one
The way Tom gives looks to Benedict after completing every sentence 😂😂 omgggg it’s so funny
ΕΙ ΜΠΙΤΕΡ
I'm Brazilian and I didn't realize this detail on the trailer until now. Lol.
tom should of said ant man
At this point we know that tobey and Andrew are in no way home. I mean Its pretty obvious that you saw villains from different universe why wouldn't you see spidermen from different universe.
Please someone tell me tobey and Andrew are in the movie or not
How are they "rumors"? Everyone knows that Tobey and Andrew are in the film. I didn't see them, but I heard that scenes featuring the two leaked online.
I don't know why but I feel like Tobey Maguire Spiderman's dies in this movie I hope I'm very wrong
brazil once again did it. i love my country
I’m still trying to figure out what she’s wearing. A kite?
poor Tom
I think ots yhe antman
ant-man
JIMMY IS SO FUNNY
Oh no! Benedict is assigned to babysit Tom
To be honest I still don't know if they gonna appear or not
BRAZILLL 🇧🇷
Look at Benedict when Tom is talking. Just waiting to cover Toms mouth.
I always wonder if Kevin Feige is somehow the master genius behind on what they can talk about, I can also imagine if Jimmy Kimmel just starts telling Kevin if he can start sweating the cast about what they're trying to hide🤣🤣🤣
Why don’t you just wait and watch the film?
Tom: “I actually kept bumping into them.” Jimmy: on set? Tom: we bumped into a party.. Jimmy: Wrap party?  I bet if Jimmy kept pestering Tom would eventually spill it.   🤣🤣🤣
0:45 was best part lol
Is jimmy gonna be craven the hunter
The way Andrew spider man caught Mj during the final battle! 🤯, just AMAZING! 😱Best movie of the year!💯🔥
Good thing Tom has that accent, half the world can't understand a thing of what he says.
I've recently seen them a lot. What on set.
Joke's on us
No upper lip was harmed in making this video.
yes!!!!!!! They are in no way home!!!!!!!!!
Love that shade
Kraven the hunter confirmed for spiderman 4
Kimmel is beating him sooooooo hard 😂
Yass jimmy keep going!!!
I actually feel bad for Tom here 7:30 he just gives up denying and asking Jimmy to have some patience!
2:25 Tom pretending like he’s shocked 😂
*Booked my tickets for 17 in 4DX 🤩🕸🕷🔥*
Well Jimmy aint wrong about capital style insurrection
Benedict’s glaring holes in the back of Tom’s head, so he doesn’t say something wrong😂
Tom was gonna have a panic attack😂 it’s too funny to see them trying to BS their way out of that trailer.
I don't think andrew and tobey in the movie
Jimmy: Tobey Magure Andrew Garfield go. Tom: * in distress * I have actually bumped in to them- Jimmy: On set? Benedict: * staring at toms soul* Just so you know, I dont need cgi for my movies
Is kraven a villan that Spider-Man will fight
6:35
Tom keeps looking at Ben, as if he’s checking whether he can say something or not.
Spoilers alert every fan wish gonna come true❤️❤️❤️
jacobs laugh is the greatest thing ever
"With being in a superhero film comes great contractual liability" 💀
It appears Tom hid a spoiler in plain sight. One point and another...
"Tobey macguire, Andrew garfield. Go ahead" - Jimmy's a Savage.
I bet you that there will be a loud roar as soon as Andrew and Tobey come on the scene
6:36 | I love how he said that! 😂😂😂
Awesome interview!!! One of Jimmy's best.
എൻ്റെ പൊന്നോ... എന്തൊരു അഭിനയം..🤣😂
Benedict staring at Tom every time he speaks 😅
I love how Benedict is ready to jump in the conversation in case Tom says anything he's not supposed to 😂
They are really bad liars. I can see that by how they are sweating and making moves to feel comfortable.
ned: I can't believe that I'm in sanctum sanctorum  stephen: neither can I
6:43 the way Tom looking at Ben asking for help how to get out of the situation lmao, i am dieing😂😂
All are stressed out man they saying what the heck spolers
Benedict Cumberbatch excuse for Lizard turning is so funny.
How they each deal with the questions nervously:  Tom: Taps the leg, looks everywhere except Jimmy's face Zendaya: Tries not to talk too much, looks at Tom Benedict: Tries to answer in a funny or smart way, looks at Tom Jacob: Laughs loudly  And all of them try to create some sort of chaos by cross talking alot 🤣
I laugh so hard on Jimmy he’s unstoppable here haha love it 😂
Yo kimmell got balls dude Kevin Feige has got the scope on all 4 of them
Another 8 hours for me to watch this movie damnnnn hype
That was so nice of jimmy to say that he wants to know for us the fans. Feeling special right now ☺️
Benedict staring at Tom every time he talks😂he's Spoiler-Man's uncle and babysitter
It s official no Toby or Andrew per se.....
So nobody seen the leaked trailer with Andrew and Toby I presume.
Tom is evolved he doesn't vomit the spoilers anymore
06:34 the most important part in this video.
Jimmy is hilarious trying to get them to spill the truth 😂
What happened to the NED being HobGoblin rumors
Yeah . . . A bird
Now I wanna know what’s up with neds family hmmm 🤔
my man so tanned what is going on
The reason why they can't deny it is because people won't be as excited as they were when they heard about the rumors. Also, might be true that they will have a short scene with both Tobey and Andrew and don't want to spoil it. Probably the reason why they can't give us straight answer.
Brasil mostrando a verdade pro mundo 🇧🇷
From that clip, I’m really thinking Doctor Strange is being controlled by Wanda
Trolling at its best
Benedict is on fire the whole interview with his jokes haha
I'm in love with Jacob's overshirt!
The fact that jimmy talking about the villains and then we see Tom and he’s like don’t even talk to me 😂
Can’t wait! Please people on tik tok no spoilers!
They’re definitely in the movie
“On the set?” 😂😂😂
I AM SO EXCITED FOR THIS MOVIE OMG I LOVE THEM SO MUCH!! <3
youll see in the movie that the other spider man are not there
Ahhhhh I’m so excited
ugh these interviews are always the best
Benedict is still in his Phil Burbank character with that deodorant joke 😂
Wasn't expecting them to show the Brazilian trailer lmao
“It’s a bird” 😭😭😂
*Contract Liabilities.* Benny with the comeback!
Benedict so nervous, his head becomes a tomato
4:42 did benedict said: "careful''
noooo, this scene just confirmed ned's part in the movie
You guys I'm telling ya'll that's Drax. The lizard got puched in the face by darx
Thank goodness it’s not scooby doo this crap
😂😂😂
Benedict has become straight up Tony Stark 😂
Lizard gets hit by a bird  Best answer Tom 😂😂😂
Do u see how Tom is not denying or confirming that their in the movie? Tobey and Andrew are back!
Spiderman NWH GBC
I missed the part where that’s my problem
Guess what? 3 spiderman
For the first time Crap sounded Better than Sh*t 😂
Jimmy: "Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, go ahead."
jimmy "tobey maguire and andrew garfield." tom: "who are they?" ig he really took some notes from jeremys interview ksjshwojsjzbejzhsksn
Damn sure Andrew and tobey are there
6:42 the way doctor strange looks talking about tobey confirms it
John cena hit the lizard
They are so bad at keeping a low profile 😂😂😂
Jimmy was trying his best to get some spoilers from Tom, but Tom gave him nothing. Poor Tom keep getting the question attack. 😂
Lizard was hit by spider brick
Why didn’t anyone iron peters shirt
You know, they want to say it but they just can't say it yet. XD
I love how marvel is owning up the little screw up they made xD
Tobey ❤️👍
Kimmel: What hit Lizard? Tom: It’s a B I R D
Bro the last half of this interview was an interrogation 💀😂😂😂
John Cena is in the film😂
*'keep goin"*  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The thumbnail attracted me 😂 2 days only for nwh 🔥
Tom Holland hasn't leaked anything about No Way Home. Somebody learn finally how to handle himself. @sabio28
i still see her as lil kid  so cute lol
Why are they blocking out crap
Benedict looks so handsome😍😍
Fans: “We Want Tobey & Andrew!” indeed!
Whenever Life gives you a hundred reasons to break down and cry, show life that you have a million reasons to smile and laugh. STAY STRONG, take time to sleep, and relax your mind, you will surely get there Love and peace to you
Bro I'm watching it tmr and I cannot contain my excitement
Tom try so hard not giving us a spoiler 😁 The other cast also worried about that
I can't even begin to imagine the pandemonium that'll breakout if those two aren't in the movie 😂
Uncle Ben(edict) was babysitting Tom Holland again and make sure he didn't spill the tea 😁
After that "yeah" from Tom, BC's face at 6:41 is priceless,lol
I love how Jacob is laughing at 2:42 just knowing brazil totally messed it up
I love how Jimmy just said "Go ahead" after mentioning Tobey and Andrew. Omg I can't stop laughing 😂
*Someone asking Tobey if he’s in the movie* Tobey: “You’ll find out when you watch this damn movie!”
I am happy they changed Stranges scooby do joke. Very nice
cannot wait to watch this in 40 hours. hells yes!
Why was it released only in Brazil ?
they look so good.
Don't worry guys, Marvel Instagram will spoil New or Returning characters within a few days of the release. Like they did with Trevor & Morris in Shang Chi and Karun &  Starfox in Eternals, they weren't even out in Australia cinema yet at the time.
"Have some patience" That's all I needed to hear
Can you count how many assassins Kevin Feige hired around this area?
This interview just embodys the notion it's just a group fo friends starring in a movie together.
THEY ARE IN, IF U LOOK AT THE REVIEWS WITH SPOILERS IT SHOWS THAT TOBEY MAGUIRE AND ANDREW GARFIELD IS IN FACT SANDMAN AND THE LIZARD
6:34 Its the future!! Squidward reference there haha
It funny he said Easter egg he's talking about neds head ..he's the future villian
My favorite part 6:20
6:37 TOM SAID YES!! TOBY IN THE FILM!! OMG!!
Spiderman(Tom Holland) vs Green Goblin(Timothee Chalamet) future and past
This interview was so funny
It has to be the hulk.
If TOBEY AND ANDREW is not here we RIOT
rn just waitin for the premiere
If the other Spider-Man aren’t in this movie the movie is whack lol
Jimmy wants to be Kraven the Hunter soooo bad lol
With great powers comes great responsibility
Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker / Spider-Man: An alternate version of Peter Parker. Maguire reprises his role from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy.  Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker / Spider-Man: An alternate version of Peter Parker. Garfield reprises his role from Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man films.  - Wikipedia
Man Tom holland got some nice hair and he got Zendaya good for you homie
Só assim pro brasil ser reconhecido  Obrigado Sonny
So glad strange doesn't actually say CRAP
Wiki just confirmed that all three spiderman r there
I really as nervou as avengers.
Ok
its a bird LOL
LMFAO THE WAY THEY ALL WATCH TOM WHEN HE SPEAKS
Ok now its obvious that craven is gonna be in the movie
Best interview so far
The way the cast is denying it just shows that they are in film and marvel will regret it if they do not put them in
BENEDICT STRAAAANGEEEEE finally!!! I really would like to see him taking on peter's father/mentor/older brother mental in the movie now that tony is gone - it would especially make sense as they 3 were so together mostly in his last times.... and also may be be jealous of (lets say) Doc ock (or anyone else who makes more sense) for getting close to peter.
wow nice
BRAZILLLLLLLL 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
benedict to tom be like: 👁👄👁
Zendaya is so precious...
Andrew's Confirmed First Spoiler in the form of a Video
JK: Please put me in this movie for god's sake!  If jimmy doesn't have a cameo we riot
All right guys! Let’s just appreciate Jimmy for trying his best to get details..he did a great job..we got some enough hunch about the movie😉
VAMO BRASIL
Tobey and Andrew confirmed in movie reviews on yt
lizard = *gets punched* fans = its tobey and andrew cast = *visible confusion*
Look at benedict's face every time tom speaks
Lizard got punched by Venom!
"I WANNA KNOW FOR THEM"
Is it ant man who punch the lizard? 🤣
6:42 there u go, the moment u wanted
Jacob Laugh made that video 100 times better
Tom holland wears heels when he stand near Zendaya ???
Spoiler , tobey and Andrew are both in it :)
Fan made poster on kraven was so hilarious 😂🤣
Wikipedia just Confirmed that Tobey and Andrew are in No Way Home ! 😁😁❤❤
"Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, go ahead"  Never had a laugh so hard and loud in a long time😂
our boy sweating so hard cant even hold him self, just let them let it out god damn it  😂😂😂😂😂😂
It’s nice Tom sat back to include everyone
The next spider man should be the spider man in the far future
It took all of Jimmy's strength to not make fun of that guys bald head
Benedict just there telling jokes and i love it
The group has great chemistry
How you cross ur legs like that lol everyone except bed hahahah yea bed
6:36 I HEAR A "YESS" RIGHT AFTER HEARING THE NAME!
Even the official wiki page of no way home now confirms Andrew and Tobey's Inclusion
Ned, grow ur fuckin hair dude
2:35 Drax punched the Lizard so still that he was invisible to the eye
Every time Tom is talking Benedict stares at him ready to slap him if he spoils
Their face when kimmy asked them about the other spiders : 👀👀
this is funny
The way tom looked at benedict says it all when asked about tobey and andrew
If the villains can make it to the multi universe then it's obvious that Tobey and Andrew will be on screen. *Mic drop
Man......i will deactivated my social media accounts until after I watch this movie
I LOVE Jacobs laugh
Moral of the story said by Tom - A bird hit the lizard
*the second Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield bump in the movie the theatre will explode*
Everyone-"Is Tobey and Andrew in the movie?" Jimmy-"Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garlfield go ahead"
At this point, it's very clear that both Spiderman are present in the movie. They know the expectations are quite high now or else they would have clearly denied it here.
I love the way you ask about tobey and andrew. 😅
Kudos to Jimmy for having shown the Brazilian trailer botch
big fan of spider-man, but can't watch the movie. There's a coup happening here.
Imagine the moment when you are sitting in the cinema and Kraven the Hunter just shows up in the movie😂😂😂
Jimmy Kimmel is the best talk show host and in top three of all time
Benedict is the oldest. Then also he is the funniest in all of them😳😳😳
Am I the only one who doesn't care if Tobey and Andrew will be in the movie? What's wrong with me :D
Got my fking ticket 🎟
Jimmy is gonna lead the rebellion if Tobey and Andrew aren't in the movie😂😂😂
Do we hear the censored swears at the movie theater?
Wrap party or rap party?
The real thing start at 6:35
TOMORROOOOOOOOOOW
Spotlights in the bedroom? Jimmy's family knows all about that!
was that jimmy kimmel as kraven the hunter...
Toothpick rig sounds like a catapult! Put that in the movie!
6:49 PLZZZZ TELL ME I’M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO THOUGHT THAT TOM GOT THAT FROM JEREMY RENNER WHEN HE DID THE INTERVIEW FROM HAWKEYE (how he kept saying who?? Who??)
This basically confirmed it
oh god just look at benedict's face when tom is speaking
Yep,  We're getting three of them.
When Tom starts speaking for too long ,you can see Benedict  getting stressed even more 😂
Zendaya's outfit is a clue, which villain has those colors? 🤔
On the set?! LOL 🤣🤣🤣
you put your little eyes on it and shake it round then there was another version of this trailer wow this is there's so many oh I don't know what country but let's look at this and see the differences here.
"Love the way you lie bruh!"
If this movie doesn’t have tobey and andrew it will be the biggest dispointment of movie history.
Could it be John Cena?
The scene is cut
kind of cringey scene
I imagine Bucky is on a steamboat down south as to why he is missing everything in his hometown
Tom : "I went to another party down the street and i bumped into Tobey, it was crazy we should have filmed it"  Tobey : *slaps Tom Holland's camera* "MOVE OUT THE WAY!"
1:21 Jacob almost spilled the beans too. XD
“tobey maguire”  tom: yes
Tom:It's a bird  Fans: is it
I love how Ned is just laughing in this entire video
Benedict response is so smooth
After 1 year I will back to this video and find my comment. Andrew and Tobey are in No Way Home.
Nice
Confirmed
It's John Cena😂
Benedict laughing so hard about the questions of Tobey and Andrew makes it damn feel that they're really their
Fun fact: Benedict was casted in this movie just to prevent Tom from spoiling stuff
Can't wait for the New Rockstars frame-by-frame breakdown of this interview 😂
7:12 that moment when jimmy jokes about jan 6 insurrection.. 😅
well here's my theory ,in trailer they mentioned those who killed by spidermans are came from different multiverse but both previous spidermans are not dead so i think they not gonna be in this
7:55 🤣
Why are they talking about this on Kimmel? Lmfao
Jimmy Kimmel is the best host.
Can someone help me settle the debate on ' who is the eldest guy here ? '  because al of them still act like children ( in a good way )
Tom has learnt...
6:35 How their  expressions changes all of a sudden hearing tobby’s name.. as if the are trained to do so if anyone ask about tobey and andrew.. especially the sudden expression change of nade was hilarious 😂
I love how we collectively pretend to not know that there will be three Spidermans in this movie.  Jimmy knows, the actors obviously know, the audience knows and this very comment section knows. Yet, everyone is like "I wonder if they are in this movie hmhhh..."  (Ofc we can't be 100% sure but come on, who are we kidding?)
LMAO, I laughed so much during this interview , probably the best one , Jimmy straight out asks them what's on our mind as fans
Jimmy Kimmel as Kraven killed me lmaooo
Told u they are not in the movie Tobey and Andrew
Damn that Tobey and Andrew question-but-not-a-question caught me off-guard. I would've blurted something out.
Jimmy nailed this one, bravo👍
At this point I think Marvel have released a red herring trailer and behind all the scheming, Tobey and Andrew will actually be in the movie as a surprise, imagine how epic that'll be.
Why do they always ask about spoilers, as if any of us want it to be spoiled before we go watch it. They obviously never answer anything so it's a waste of interview time.
Jimmy be like : trying his best to get Tom to spill out Tobey and Andrew 😂
Tom in an interview: Breathes Fans: that confirms everything
We know it's a bird named Andrew Garfield's spider man
Unpopular opinion: I think the Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire rumours massively promoted this upcoming movie, just from the rumours alone.
Imagine if after all this, Topher Grace was the only surprise character in the movie...
Tickets booked: 18th of December.
I love the fact that whenever Tom answers a question Benedict keeps on watching him, so he can stop any spoilers from spilling..😂
I am not gonna lie, tom spoiled it, but as a joke.  I ran into them a few times actually, they shoulda filmed it.  hahaha
Poor tom wkwkwkwkwk
I feel like a Miles will show up
Jimmy is literally thr audience 😂 no hesitation just straight up asking
Children making childish movies what a waste!
Kimmel the Hunter
I never realized until that "Easter Egg" poster how much Jimmy Kimmel looks like Alan Parsons.
As long as Alfred Sang "If I Were a Rich Man" again on set, then I'm happy.
Jimmy Kimmel: "Tobey Maguire & Andrew Garfield Go Ahead!"
Jimmy: “I want to know it for them…” Yea sure not just to make it boost ur ratings and gain more revenue from the interview
Someone spoil the movie for me please? I just want to know what happens,does Toby and Andrew show up at the end? What!!!!!
You mean matt murdock, tobey has family,andrew talks about gwen, otto helps  at the end, andrew saves mj, may dies, everyone forgets even strange, mid credit: tom hardy venom getting transported symbiote teases, post credit:strange trailer he 's in  outer space, wanda vs wong and new logo. Yeah people no spoiler please.
😂😂
If they are not n film, WE RIOT
Kraven the hunter🤣🤣
Jimmy was responsible increasing Tom's blood pressure that night. I wouldn't be surprised if Tom had actually passed out while talking there
Insurrection guaranteed 😂😂
They're trying so hard not to spoil this while the professional reviewers just straight up spoiling the movie lol
Its not a bird its JOHN CENA
Andrew and tobey confirmed 100%
If Tobey and Andrew are in the movie....then we will lose our sh*t. If they're not in the movie....then we will lose our sh*t.  AT SOME POINT IN THE CINEMAS SH*T WILL BE LOST!
why is tom holland wearing Zendaya's clothes XD
The toothpick rig i think i heard he say it on the hot ones channel
I loved that the whole time Benedict was keep minding Tom's words to make sure nothing get out from him.
🙌
7:10 Benedict staring at tom like "say anything and i will sucker punch u in the back of the head"
WAIT 3 GENERATIONS OF CINEMA?!!  CONFIRMED!!
Ned asking about magic literally gives away what Ned will do
I know interview questions are always screened even when they’re a “surprise” but damn Tom was sweatin’. 😂
Benedict's face in 6:40 🤣
Andrew and Tom deserve an Oscar just for denying the rumours.
Ok now it’s confirmed that Andrew and Toby aren’t in it
Spoiler alert: it's venom
Maybe lizard just got some dirt in his eye..
Tobey and Andrew are in the movie it's confirmed go check out Wikipedia page🔥
If you want to know when Benedict Cucumberpatch said "contractual liability" It was 7:56
Don't expect to much or u might be disappointed
IT is Antman!
Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield ❤❤❤❤ Go ahead 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
It could be miles morales invisible
In another universe Tom Spoiling 😂😂😂 Sony and Marvel be like ::: 😫😫😫🤘😱😅😆😲😦😧😭😭😭
I'm just thinking about a fight taking place on the statue of liberty when it's meant to have a cap shield being added
😂 i feel bad for Tom lol
I love candy
Andrew's clip just got leaked guys. It'd be stupid for them to deny at this point.
Jimmy's my hero and Benedict is just too quick witted 😂
2:39 hahahaha 😭👍
Jimmy has some great lines and comebacks that are very very smart and witty.
Tom: “I’ve actually been bumping into them” Jimmy: “on the set?”  LOLLL
Benedict just loosing his mind. Going full comedian.
I've been so addicted to No Way Home related videos. I even made a whole video essay talking about all the previous Spider-Men movies. Thursday can't come soon enough
I'm so excited I can't wait., I don't want any spoilers guys until I see it
Dislike
At first when Kimmel was fan-casting himself as Kraven, I  didn't think it would work. But seeing him in the costume and photoshop, I kinda want him to at least audition as Kraven
2:59 debris from the statue? Really? An iconic scene with an epic fight and the lizard got hit by some debris?
Marvel would be so scared 😅 to send Tom Holland ❤️🤣🤣
Some magic 🪄 is stopping Tom 😂🤣🤣
Crazy how Aunt May died.
I just love how they try their best not to spoil anything but they know, we know, everyone knows what's gonna happen in the film and you can just see that they accepted that there's no point keeping secrets anymore 😂
6:35 After Jimmy said: „Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, go ahead” look how Benedict stares at Tom. Benedict is ready to stop Tom whenever he will say too much. Its confirmed now they are in the movie.
Alright anybody noticed  Tom said ya! at 7:17 he just did again.   Look at strange when Tom unintentionally says "ya" 😂
oh i love jimmy so much
GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME 🔥
Other villains 😳
Jimmy is kinda right ... if Tobey and Andrew aint in this movie I wonder how the fans will react
Benedict is Marvel’s spoiler guard dog and poor Tom looks like he was panicking the entire time. Meanwhile Zendaya and Jacob are having the time of their life.
As much as I love the Spider-man, I can't not think about a title "It's coming home", you know, as the English soccer chant, just.. nevermind.. great to see them again on this show lol
we all know they are in the movie
The way Benedict is watching him while he talks about the cast is gold hahahahaha
TOM IS HOLDING HARD!!!!
SPOILER 🚧🛑 DOCK OCK WILL DIE😢
XXDXDXD tobey , Andrew ... go aheaddd XDXDXD
Tom said the film is celebration of 3 generations.... Soo Tobey and Andrew confirmed 😅😉😉
"You mean you saw him at the wrap party"!  HAHAHAHAHA!  Jimmy was on point!
Thats why Jimmy Kimmel is my Fav. HOST!!!
Jimmy: tobey maguire andrew garfield go ahead  Tom: who are they? Jimmy: years ago they played your role in spider costume. Tom: i've actually recently like bumping into them Jimmy: on the set?😅😂 Tom: and there was a party and i bumped into it? Jimmy: wrap party?😅😂
They do very obvious because they know we all know that the spider verse is real hhaahha
Jimmy kimmel as Kraven would be hilarious
TBH I would love to see Jimmy play Kraven. I think he can put on a mean face
The primary reason Benedict came along was not promoting the movie, but to ensure Tom keep his mouth shut 😅
The way Benedict is looking at tom so hard  to not spoil anything
“Capital style insurrection if they aren’t in this movie.” I felt that 100%
I’m callin it Robert Downey Jr Makes his final appearance
So amazing whenever Tom talks, everyone keeps quiet and just looks at him...hahaha
I know who hit lizard in that battle. That's definitely antman.. he's so small you cant see him
Andrew and Tobey are at NWH, and there will be an Emma/Kirsten cameo
I think by now everyone knows both spidey's are gonna be in this film why they're trying to hide it still is funny
I know people don't always love Kimmel's interview's but this is a good one!
It's nice that Tom Holland wore Benedict's suit for a shirt.
Why’s Tom out partying during a pandemic?
HAHAHAHHA
Ok i watched special premiere today and cries like a little baby when andrew and toby dies for saving tom's universe😭😭😭
Its antman who hit the lizard
If Kraven's actually the 6th villain to round out the Sinister 6 for No Way Home... good on you Jimmy lol.
Seems like tom has been given scripted lines to speak everywhere to not spoil anything, he said the same lines about alfred adjusting to new methods of cinematography and about his new CG arms and also the toothpick crane or something. He said all these in the exact same manner in the interview at hot ones first we feast xd
Jimmy is trying to spoil the movie from  tom
I recently bumped into them..  On the set??
Brasileiro é foda demais, os cara revela tudo e nada mais importa 🤣🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
I can't believe there are still people doubting if Toby and Andrew is in the movie. They are doing this multiverse thing only to bring them back and cash in on the nostalgia fans.
Freaking respect to jimmy kimmel literally not holding back ✊🏼✊🏼
3:42 OMG this voice 😍😍🥰🥰
Yes Toby and Andrew are in the movie :)
Guys, check Tobey and Andrew's wiki pages and look at the filmography. You will find what you are looking for.
Woah did the trailers completely mislead what the spell was?
Jimmy Kimmel is the interviewing GOAT for this film hands down
My Sherlock ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Kimmel as usual got annoying with his pressing on Tom about the spoilers. It’s such a played out boring talk show antic.  Also throughout the entire interview Thomas body language and demeanor really made it seem like he didn’t wanna be there. Looks tired. Poor bb haha
Jimmy was trying so hard to get Tom to slip up lol Disney has their eyes on him at all times
Is crap a bad word??
I thought Marvel had forgiven Tom when he was allowed to go on Colbert by himself. He must have said something he shouldn't if they're sending Benedict in with him again.
i bet benedict still has flashbacks from baby sitting tom in avengers interviews 🤣
2:55 he hilarious for that😂😂😂
1:46 , Aaron showed up not aaron stone
Jacob’s laugh is contagious lmfao
2:20 saw his life flash before his eyes
Bought the tickets.
You're here for 6:38 You're welcome
“You know there’s gonna be a Capitol style insurrection if they don’t appear in this film?”  -tom and everyone else “yeah😩😮‍💨” That proves that even they’re tired of keeping it a secret lol and everyone in the world is expecting it
“Toby Maguire. Andrew Garfield. GO AHEAD!!!” 😳😂🤣
I love the way how Benedict stares at Tom everytime he opens his mouth to speak 😂
Ned's laugh 🤣... When Jimmy said "Tobey and Andrew, go ahead"
They say this will be the best movie ever
OMG Benedict is sooo red-faced trying to dodge spoilers and looking at Tom to keep his mouth shut BAHAHAHA 😂
💀
In a Spiderman movie dealing with multiple Spidermen and this clown says Sue Storm instead Miles Morales.
This like i'm seeing endgame part 2 interview starring rdj,scarlett,paul rudd and c.hemsworth. who else here?😎
cant believe he actually did this
6:35- Jimmy Kimmel got they so good almost spoiler the movie. That a close one and well play Jimmy  to tricking the cast to fall for that. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
The stress on Tom’s face 😂
Zendaya is in love- the way she's glancing and looking at Tom💖💘
7:48- Jimmy Kimmel say “with Great Power Becomes a great responsibility”. He say it guys 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
2 hours
Bendicts face is absolutely red when he asks about Andrew and tobey 🤣
OMG these guys is hilarious
Maybe Tobey will appear in Spider Man No Way Home If he s here I ll be very glad.
I can’t believe jimmy showed them the lizard clip 😆
They all are just try to hide rumors about tobey and andrew's spider man 🤣🤣after watching brazilian trailer of no way home
The thing I love about these interviews with Jimmy is it seems like he actually likes these movies and is a genuine marvel fan so he can make it fun and educated
what if jimmy really are in the movie as kraven
I love this :D
The lizard scene is actually antman punching lizard
We all know why strange doesn't want to have kids
Lmao everyone looked at Tom when he mentioned Tobey and Andrew
Brasil sempre crescendo no cenário internacional. Sony brasileira é a maior vazadora mundial kkkkkkkkkkk Obrigado Brasil S3
Jimmy winning Oscar for playing the Spanish Inquisitor.
Why wouldn’t they bring the spidermen back but bring back villains
This just seems like the studio setting this up at this point. ABC is owned by Disney (I know it’s technically a Sony film).
Who is that in 1:47 poster
The fact that Tobey and Andrew is coming is the secret we all know but we ourselves want to keep it secret and want to get surprised in the cinema halls..
The fact that Tobey and Andrew is coming is the secret we all know but we ourselves want to keep it secret and want to get surprised in the cinema halls..
Its a bird guys
jacobs laugh is so infectious
At 7:12 The way Tom was so relaxed when Jimmy was saying their will be insurrection if Tobey and Andrew isn't in the movie makes it they are probably in it..
Jimmy was not holding back about Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield😂😂😂😂😂
When he said removing characters and Brazil I new EXACTLY what he was talking about
I'm somehow more excited for Andrew and Toby not being in NWH
Andrew e Tobey estão fantásticos no filme 🤯🤯
Tom just won’t say anything 🤣🤣
Damn, Benedict Cumberbatch being handsome and all
Benedict is such a class
Benedict Cumberbatch would be so proud seeing tom has grown up and is not spoiling movie 😂 . Oh wait what if it's not our tom 😐
I can tell Tom is extremely tensed.
Benedict is such as dad with his jokes 😂
Yo s/o to jimmy for beeing a straight shooter
They are expecting ant man cameo
Lol Benedict’s response to Lizard freaking killed me😂😂
6:36 Ned Knows Something 😂 😆 yes I don’t know his real name.
they all look so done with the rumours and questions about Tobey and Andrew
Lmao can't fool me
I bet Tom Was feeling a bit like Arthur From the Joker movie during this interview. Man must be absolutely screaming inside.
4:56 is kinda a spoiler if you think about it
I love how they think they're still keeping Tobey and Andrew a secret.
What if marvel actually casts Jimmy as Kraven ?
The Spider man theme playing one more time , the music of my childhood in modern cinemas . And then appears Tobey Maguire after almost 15 years The nostalgia is gonna get real 🥺   edit : " *Guys , clearly we're not very good at this* "
Did they put jimmy’s face on Kravens body ????
Jimmy Kimmel staring in Spider-Man 😆
Nah it’s uncle Ben who is punching lizard
i think i'm having more pressure than the casts while watching this interview :)
We Stan jimmy for trying to get Tom to slip 😂😂
🤣🤣❤
7:59 that laugh is more menacing than Dafoe🤣
Yes there’s 3 SPIDER-MEN in this movie right at the end, 3rd act, last fight…You’re Welcome
Just got a confirmation from a movie review and yes tobey and Andrew is in this movie😭🙌🏽🙌🏽
07:14 Toby and Andrew confirmed lol Benedict chuckling in the back says it all
They're in the movie we know c'mon already 😩😩
Why didn't Jimmy ask them about Venom  2 post credit scene??
"It's a bird!" VULTURE CONFIRMED
Appreciate it. But 3 days.... Just wait for 3 days... Don't ruin it for everyone
If tobey and andrew wont in this movie !, its gonna be war world three
Jacob said "You just have to wait". So its done. See you all at the theatre
"tobey maguire, andrew garfield. go ahead!"
Tom Holland needed to hold himself back to keep from spoiling Tom Hardy was in the movie
theory we see jimmy fallon as kraven in the end credit scene being killed by a kraven from another universe ????
Jimmy has death wish
6:36 "tobey maguire" "yes"
Every time Jimmy speaks Tom gets stressed that he's gonna spoil something.. And everytime Tom speaks Benedict gets stressed that Tom's gonna spoil something... Ahhh!!That's so hilarious..😅😅😅
Jimmy: "you can see lizard get punched by..." Tom: "it's a bird" 😂😂🤣
Poor Tom
Haha Toms wrinkly shirt
Lizard getting punched is a 100% proof that we will get want we want!!!
when jimmy brought up invisible woman, tom shouldve said "oh right yeah it was really fun working with emily blunt that day"
Omg I love how jimmy just keeps pushing lol
Jimmy is RUTHLESSS
Lizard gets punched *  Tom; its a bird..its a bird  😭
Jacob Batalon's laugh is really contagious
The look at 5:54 like “am I good? Going too far?”😂
Saw the movie tonight in LA. Sorry guys, Andrew and Tobey aren’t in the movie.
Must admit best I've seen Tom at not spoiling things
Oh god, please Tobey and Andrew be in the film!
"SPOILER" It's already released in  here  And Yeah U guy's r gonna get What u deserve all are gonna show up at the end of the movie
1:49. If you ignore the context: Jimmy Kimmel as John Snow!
The part you came here to see is at 6:36
The way Benedict is nervously watching Tom as he talks is hilarious.
2:46 Seriously Tom? A bird??
people in the philippines crying because of social media spoilers
This is probably the best interview for Jimmy yet, well expect for Matt Damon 😂. I mean he didn't hold anything back here.
😂😍😂😍😂😍😂😍😂😍😂
Sony Brasil representando🇧🇷🇧🇷
I’m surprised Tom Holland hasn’t leaked anything about No Way Home yet. Props to him 😂
jacob’s reaction
7:07 _You know there's gonna be a Capitol-style insurrection if they're not in this movie right?_  Haha lmao true. That's what I've been feeling from the fanbase. If they're not in it, this would be the biggest expectations disappointment from a mere film rumour misinformation
6:45 That Benedict's stare at Tom was intense lmao
OMG jimmy was on fire in the end lol
Capitol like insurrection if they don't show up 😂😂
Dude this interview was just no mercy lmao
Garfield is wearing his TASM2 suit. Tobey was not deaged and looks kinda like an uncle. NO Venom, Falcon, Scorpion, Vulture, or Hulk. No real surprise MCU cameos Aunt May gets killed by Green Goblin. Ned, Happy, and MJ are all there Doctor Strange appears throughout the film. His role is not big. Doctor Octopus ends up helping the good guys. Electro gets defeated by Octavius. Aunt May says "With great power comes great responsibility" In the end, the villains actually get sent back reformed and they don't die in battle.
ruh roh
Such a dead giveaway
HE ACTUALLY PLAYED THAT TRAILER😭😭
6:36 I love Jimmy 😂😂😂
the scooby doo line lands way better in this clip than the trailer
What says Doctor Strange in 0:26? Someone tell me please
You can just tell that they can’t wait for the movie to come out so people shut the hell up and stop asking them stuff they are contractually obligated not to say. 😂
SCOOBY DOO THIS CRAP
Yeah whatever, anyway. Can't wait to see Tobey Maguire back.
Benedict is sooo red trying to make sure tom doesn’t spill 😭
You can see Tom going over topics that he was prompted to talk about on Hot Ones, that's where all the best content comes from lmao
6:09 “see you in a bit darlin’”
Zendaya is gorgeous and would look stunning  if she wore a burlap sack. Tom is a lucky guy.
Malayalam
nah, john cena punched the lizard
Jacob sure is laughing a lot every time Tobey and Andrew are mentioned…
2:51 it got me 😹😹😹😹
YOU RELIZE with everything that he asked and how sus they where litterally just gave it away especially when they brought up the lizard they know that scene that’s why they didn’t say one word 😁 my spidey Sences got a little tingly about all of that that’s for sure
C'mon 100% Andrew and Toby are gonna be there it's the obvious
Jimmy Kimmel: "Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield. Go ahead!" Benedict Cumberbatch: (straight face) 😂
the way Benedict whisper "careful" to Tom while he talk LOL, 4:43
Zendaya is so annoying.
"Tobey and Andrew, go ahead." "On set?" "Wrap party?"  Jimmy is such a jerk
Tom got a bit annoyed
JIMMY SAID "GO AHEAD" LMAOOOOO
07:21 Wrap Party You got me
I think spiderman farted that's why lizard turned his face away. lizard be like WTF ???
4:49 "3 generations of cinema".... so 3 spidermen
Two things you must NOT do before watching the movie: 1. Let Tom Holland talk; 2. Let Mark Ruffalo have a cellphone at the premiere.😂
zendaya looks so stunning in this 🔥🔥
6:35 is what you’re here for
Maguire and Garfield had their F%$(&$ chance! Raimi´s Parker is an insult to the Peter Parker i grew up reading!
This video got less views cuz are avoiding this for possible ideas that they dont wanna have.
Ned has tinglings in his hands? He is a wizard, why didn't he get his Hogwarts letter?
i'll see the rest of yall on the silver screen
Also Jimmy Kimmel as Kraven? Ya I’m all for it? 😂😂😅😳 why do I want it haha he’s been joking about it so long but I hope they cast him 😂😂
We are all Jimmy right now ..we're dying to know about Tobey and Andrew.
This is going to be LEGENDAAAARY
3:58 How'd that get in there?
7:11 “You know there’s gonna be a Capitol style insurrection if they’re not in it.” LMAOOO I’m pretty sure Jimmy will be leading that insurrection ☠️ 😂
Jimmy as Kraven never fails to entertain
Obviously it was antman who punched the Lizard.
6:34 I laughed so hard 😂
Jimmy is just simply awesome when interrogate Tom about Tobey and Andrew!
Tom actually said “ your going to the Premier aren’t you have some patience”. Ugh hello he just said it!!
"Scaffold the Incredible Pole" LOL
Jimmy is representing all of us when he keeps trying to get answers 🤣
I love how much Kimmel genuinely loves Spidey. He always geeks out about it. No wonder little Billy loves Spidey so much. 🥺 🕷 ♥️
I’m 100% convinced Jimmy is in the film.
Jimmy Kimmel as Kraven the hunter?
Bro this anxiety is killing me. Are they there or not
The fact that this is being discussed on Jimmy Kimmel is surprising.
The other 2 are present there its just papa feige won't let us see them
I had not heard any rumors of Tobey or the other guy being in the movie - until this week.  And I already am sick of it.  I could not care less if either of them are in it.  But since Dafoe died in the universe we are familiar with, I would rather have seen Franco make a  return.
man just 5 mins more and Tom would've broken... damn it Jimmy!
Man Jacobs laugh lmao😂😂🤣🤣
Jacob dijo una groseria
wow you really tortured them
If you haven't realized Tobey and Andrew are definitely in this, you seriously need help and I'm worried about you...
Como me gustaría saber inglés para entender estas entrevistas
7:38 Jimmy you have my heart. The best talk show host ever!
They have no shame😁
Drax is the invisible puncher
Sony & Marvel : NO SPOILERS PLEASE !  Social Media : They Are Starting To Coming Through.... And I Can't Stop Them !! 😂😂😂
First world problem: are 2 former spidermen going to join the new spiderman in a comic book movie?   cue rumours & speculations & anticipation all year long. if this much energy is spent on other worthwhile meaningful things, imagine what people could get done.
I can see Jimmy Kimmel as Kraven the hunter
Just a day for Spidees Assemble 😀❤️👍
Benedict cumberbatch handles these spoiler questions so well, you could tell that the rest of the cast felt so much more at ease when he swoops in to answer a difficult question
Zendaya Looking Damn Cute
5:01 he did it
You could see how nervous Tom is
The admin messed up the upload order ;_;
It was John cena
I want jimmy Kimmel as kraven the hunter
Obviously Garfield and Maguire are in it
Ant Man
6:38 for everybody wondering
That scene has made me come to the conclusion that ned actually has some kinda magic powers
Lmao tom was already annoyed at 8:15
that fact that they cant deny it makes me believe theyre in it
What if it's Doc Oc who actually punches the lizard??
This was great!!! Benedicts responses are great! And the way he is watching tom holland answer questions so he dont blow it is hilarious
Its so funny that they know we know but they play it off so obnoxiously
It’s hilarious when everyone looked at Tom when they were talking bout tobey and Andrew 😂
When tom said it’s a bird, they missed the chance to refer superman. It’s a Bird, It’s a Plane, It’s Superman😂😂. It’s a DC/Marvel Crossover😂😂
Jimmy: Marvel is known for sometimes digitally removing charectars  Tom: *nervous sweating*
Kimmel was going a bit too far. You could tell the actors were getting annoyed. And Benedict didn't look pissed at Kimmel. Of course even Tom was getting mad
wait so that thing about Ned was true 😳
Another clip 😀❤️👍
LOL, smelly lizard arm pits
Benedict Cumberbatch is just red from laughing 😂
Oh Jimmy  Trying so hard to get something out of them before the release 😂😂
Tom almost shat himself towards the end. 😂😂 Ofcourse they both are in it. He is dying to get it off his chest.
Love Jimmy’s character🤣🤣🤣💀 I would watch it
Movie of the year is coming can't wait
Watching the movie cause of Tobey
"On the set?"😂😂
Tom looks confirms everything fine 😅
Tom Holland stressed face when Tobey and Andrew was mentioned 😂😂😂
They were trying so hard to blow off tobey and Andrew after jimmy showed them the clip
Jimmy is such a mega fan and I love it
Why is nobody talking about the possibility of miles morales being in the movie
Nice try Jimmy ❤️🌹🦋
What if in the end we see jimmy kimmel as kraven😂😂
2:42 Lizard got punched by Sue Storm. C’mom bro 🤷‍♂️
Seeing as Tobey is hated by alot of people in the business. I doubt he'll be in the movie. More like they're CGI him in.
If our boys are in this movie too Tobey and Andrew I feel bad they didnt get to interview for this movie :'(
jimmy going hard
Enough of your chicken sounds...  We want to see mafias and similar innocence...
lmao i love kimmel the hunter
It's confirmed. At 4:50 Tom says that this movie is a celebration of three generations of cinema and at last Benedict says that there comes contractual liability.😍😍🤩🤩
We want tobey and andrew spiderman
Benedict like; pls don't spoil anything 6:45 till end
Kravin the hunter
Hey or jimmy you didn’t say Spider-Man 2 Alfred Doc ock and Rhys lizard
a bird wow a bird pushed that big lizard
Kevin Feige starring at Tom  Holland
Is miles morales gonna be in the new spiderman?
Tom: I’ve actually recently like been bumping into them all the ti.. Jimmy: On the set!!!?  💀😂😭
Benedict is back there sitting like "if he spoils something, I'll have to use the spell to make everyone forget about it again"
Benedict looks so red LMAO..
I always like to think Tobey and Andrew are just in hiding in the back.
Neds laugh and Tom holla saying it’s bird! Lmao😂💀
Tom said yes after jimmy said tobey and Andrew …
Thank you Jimmy for doing this!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️ soon as I saw it upload on here my heart just exploded
Jimmy: "Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield" Tom: "Please don't"  But damn Jimmy is literally not holding back
Jimmy as leaven the hunter is just funny af
Scooby-Doo this SH**?!?!?!? How amazing!!
Woahhh hahaha
I died at it's a bird
jimmy out here confirming andrew and tobey or condemning these poor ppl to the most disappointing thing they will ever see
Kevin: Scaffold the Incredible Pole coming in theaters 2024
You can tell they are just done with all the spoiling, they want to get it out already!!  So so excited for this. Truly will be a highlighted movie of the year!
Okay, this is actually making me think Tobey and Andrew are not coming...
Jimmy was just so straight to the point! BWHAHAHA!!! 😆🤣🔥 TOBEY MAGUIRE AND ANDREW GARFIELD GO AHEAD!!!
someone lock this cast up because i’m sending them so much love it possibly might burst them
The way Benedict is looking at Tom to make sure he doesn't spoil anything
These talkshows are planned well ahead and are well scripted. If they're alluding to Tobey and Andrew, it's being done on purpose.
Lizard gets backflip kicked by the amazing spiderman
Tom’s ‘yeah’ at 7:18 basically confirms everything and Benedict can’t help but laugh to himself lmao. Tom is too honest!
So I guess it's probably the 69th time I've seen them address this question.
The character development for Mary Jane Watson in this trilogy is fantastic  At first they had her in the background teasing that she would be relevant later  Then she awkwardly started to show her feelings towards Peter at the same pace with him  It felt really realistic how they interacted  It's their first ever big falling in love moment so both weren't sure what to do   Now she's just chilling and perfectly comfortable hanging out with all of them   They took one of the most beloved character in Spiderman and gave it a totally different approach  And as a result they pulled off something much cooler imo with much more personality and charisma
LOL
That cast was SWEATING!! 😅😅😅
“Wrap party” LMAOOOOO
OMG it's Barnacle Clampersnatch    :/
“On the set” LMAOOOO AHAHAHAH
Jesus, this must be the best interview I've seen with the cast, Jimmy doesn't even care hahaha
Jimmy doin his best to break them 😆😆
“They’ll follow you home” LMAOOOO AHAHAHAAH
6:40 That's a pretty nervous look from Tom considering Tobey and Andrew "aren't" in the movie.
I didn't think about it but yes, there will be insurrection if Tony/Andrew aren't in this
Fans: Give us Tobey and Andrew Sony:You will get them if you fix this damn door
“Tobey Maguire. Andrew Garfield”  Tom: Who are they? 💀
They're so bad at keeping secrets 😂
삼스파 다 나옴 ㅅㄱ 3 spidies on moive
im glad they changed it to “scooby doo this sh*t” it sounds so much better. I’m guessing that’s what it always was but they didn’t want to use “bad words” in the trailer.
I love Jacob’s laugh its contagious 😂
“Wow I think I need some deodorant” 😂😂😂
6:42 Tom: 😁👏   Benedict: stop that right now 👁👄👁
6:34 is what you came for. Thank me later
My anxiety is so thin each time Tom starts speaking 😂 more than cumberbatch ever cud be 😂
Awesome.
3:30 *scaffold the incredible pole confirmed* damn they really upped the budget on this one
Benedict said yes When asked about Andrew and Tobey
"Rumors" seems like Kimmel is also under the custody of Feige.
Another reason to have Tom Holland and Benedict C. On the same interview
When Tom makes the same jokes on hot ones 😂
Jacobs adorable.
Personally, I don't don't think armed insurrection against the government is very funny.
Damn Jimmy pressed them hard. Tom almost looked kinda annoyed towards the end. I know they pre approve these questions but I think he pushed a little harder than he should have.
This movie does more to make me angry than happy. Just show Tobey and Andrew and stop playing with all  our emotions. Its pissing me off.
Jimmy's the best interviewer.  I'm so excited to see the movie!!
"With being in a superhero film comes great contractual liability." - Benedict Cumberbatch
Jacob/Ned is hilarious. There are a lot of Filipinos/Filipino Americans in the medical field.
*The second Tobey and Andrew come into frame theaters will literally implode.*
I wish i could sit with Benedict 🥺😍
Love a one shot
I wonder if they put Benedict Cumberbatch in this movie simply so he can keep an eye on Tom during interviews.
who watched the spider-man premiere live on tiktok
if MJ or Ned die, i’m dying with them
I’m so glad he didn’t actually say “crap” 😂
“Please put me in this movie for god sake” LMAOOOO AHAHAHAHA
The fact that Tom Holland hasn't spoiled Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield's appearances in No Way Home worries me. It probably means they're not in it
its so painful when your country cant open theater yet
Jimmy outdid himself tn 😂
omg they get so red 😂
7:32 Tom getting actually heated at Jimmy for testing him
*Jimmy* Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield. Go ahead *Jacob* 🤣🤣🤣 *Me* uhh… okay!
SPIDER HAM! SPIDER HAM! SPIDER HAM! SPIDER HAM! SPIDER HAM! SPIDER HAM!
keep that clown out of the mcu!
You can tell that Benedict really stressed out everytime Tom opens his mouth. 😂
I have never been this early and I’m proud
Oh my god, I knew it was scooby-doo this sh*t!
Jimmy asking real questions here bro!!!
I SO want a full Jimmy as Kraven movie.  Settle for nothing less ! Lol
Jk: " Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, go" That segment didn't even need much description XD
Jimmy Kimmel: Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield… Go ahead Tom Holland: Who are they? Kevin Feige: You’re Done… You’re Done
C'mon.. if the MCU people had half a brain, they'd work in a Jimmy as Kraven bit into the movie. It's 100% in line with their sense of humor, even... Dooo eeeet.
Ben's response to the great responsibility line is GOLD!
Imagine Jimmy Kimmel actually got fit enough to play Kraven 😂 that’s be so crazy
Wow Kimmel did not hold back on this one, kinda respect it
I feel like this basically just confirmed they’re jn there
Yes Tom. Go ahead!
Okay, the scooby do this crap sounds way more cooler in the actual movie, in the trailer, it seemed a bit too goofy, I like that they used this take lmao
0:45 Scooby-Doo This 2:52 I need to use Deodorant
“With being in a superhero film comes great contractual liability” 🤣
They're with Jimmy Kimmel and at the premiere at the same time. Multiverse confirmed!!!
I need to stop watching any Spiderman interview bc I don't wanna know anything beforehand.  I didn't even watch the trailer LOL but I couldn't resist watching these amazing casts talking.
Jimmy Kimmel: "With great power comes great responsibility" Benedict Cumberbatch: "Well, with being in a superhero film, comes great contractural liability," That is such a great response!
I will not be satisfied until we see Jimmy Kimbel in a Marvel movie!
“You want Tobey &Andrew” Get religion.!
they should cast matt damon as kraven to screw with jimmy
6:41 When Tom looked at Benedict, he is like " Daddy help me "
WOOOOH YEAH BABYYYY!
i am in tears lmao
I now know that this show is not live, as they are currently at the red carpet premiere.

Why is Jimmy trying so hard to spoil the movie? Does he not have any jokes except trying to spoil things, tf??
0:44  *SCOOBY DOO THIS (BEEP)*

They're not even trying to deny anymore 🤣
You know Kevin Feige is lurking in background waiting for Tom to spoil something.
Kimmel should show up in ATJs Kraven movie. He's really Hunting for info.

Great cover-up lizard thought mid fight ,"wait  i need some deodrant".
Tom is really nervous 😂😂😂 He doesn't want to give spoilers I guess 😂😂😂
Fans: “We Want Tobey & Andrew!” Sony: “You’ll see them when you buy your damn ticket!”
This isn’t funny
You can see Benedict staring hella HARD at Tom making sure he doesn't say a word out of line.
Lol the way jimmy said Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield Go Ahead

If Tobey Maguire doesn't do his signature bad boy dance in no way home, the movies a disappointment.

1:31 The way that Tom doesn't even trust himself LMFAO
The clips from the film are so funny omg I love ned so much 😂
