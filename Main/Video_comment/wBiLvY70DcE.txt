Nature doesn’t care.

Has the Governor come back from Italian holiday yet?
It is time for you to approach everything you do during the day consciously. You should constantly control your thoughts and feelings. Any negative thought in your consciousness must be nipped in the bud. Protect yourself from everything that contributes to the existence of negative thoughts and feelings in your consciousness.
So, partially reopened, like we can drive up to the part that fell off?
Wow!!   I have some good news to share with all you in the comments! Take care.   1 Corinthians 15:1-4 King James Version  15 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;  2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.  3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;  4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
Are they that greedy?
Im a man on a mission
I hear rumors that some of the extreme environmental groups are going to seek an injunction to stop any of the rebuilding of the roads or infrastructure lost in the floods... Their claim is that the roads have  changed the river from what would of been its natural coarse... and that a full blow EIS will be required for any work started to repair any of the damage...They will  Judge shop and do what ever they can to stop any further human damage to what they say and the park service says is the most natural park in the US... I guess be careful who was your friend in the last push to return the park to a natural state... This time they will use the tools they used last time to help you against you.....
Of all the national parks, Yellowstone is notorious for minimizing human footprint and preserving nature.  Yet it is most plagued by natural disasters.
I love the work, keep it up.
This will refill lake mead
Wow just wow
Geez that's horrible
I was wondering if there are people who actually watch these videos, these types of videos are trending in the most watched ones Nobody can interfere in anyone's life
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🟥
Co ty mi  zrobisz w domu w łóżku przez telefon ?
there is no economy, there is only the environment. capitalism is a disease of the environment which man is a part of. capitalism is the pathology. the rich are festering infections of society, to be lanced
Is this the start of something bigger.
"And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life.  And the dead were judged according to their works, by the things which were written in the books. The sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works.  Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire." (REVELATION 20:12-15 NKJV)   Today, while you are still alive and able, may you repent from your sins, believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that JESUS CHRIST is your Lord and Savior, so that through Him, your name will be written in the Book of Life.    "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.  For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved." (JOHN 3:16-17 NKJV)   ✝️ JESUS LOVES YOU. HE DIED FOR YOU.  Please do not ever forget that..
Brings a whole new meaning to “houseboat”
They're flooding, and we're in a multi year drought. Can you pump some of that water our way?
Time to take that tube for a spin!
I glad Nature is giving its animals a break from humans
The governor is an a hole.
WAY TO GO JOHN DUTTON REROUTED THE RIVER FROM THE DEVELOPMENT AGAIN
Does this mean they have laid off all the park employees in the north
Yellowstone 🟡 🪨
I hope the animals enjoyed their time off from being bothered by disrespectful assholes
the road became that one road from days gone
Man this guy now has a portable house by turning it into a boat! 😂💀
She failed to say just the South entrance...and about the license plate thing about odd and even days
Would be really sweet if Yellowstone erupted.
This will probably be a good thing for the parks animals and plant life in the long run.  Without tourists being able to access large swaths of the park, nature will be able to do its thing in peace.  It's kind of a catch 22.  We build these parks so we can preserve nature so that we will be able to enjoy it, but by enjoying nature, we harm it.
Did that guy got his Tesla out?
Be cool to see Yellowstone erupt
Repent and turn to the Lord. Only Jesus Christ can save you, heal you. Be everything you need. He's the great I Am.
