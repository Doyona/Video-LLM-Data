Who do you think will dish out the most goodness in today's competition?
rewatching old videos makes me missed their concepts not the elephants in the room 😭
Oh boy
16:26 Not the first time a try guys heard that. 😜. Bada Bing
How cute was that Nacho Zach? Seriously that looked like a party showstopper
Zach opening the mango gave me so much pain
No one thought doctor who???? If you know the word im talking about 😂
its so funny zach be doing kung fu moves
OK... Eugene without a beard - handsome. Eugene with a beard. Holy crap. 🤤
9:46 I hope you didn't say that to Alex😖
25:53 yeah you are🙄
The irony of this episode makes me sick
I have watched The Try Guys from Day 1 and I just know noticed that Keith makes me feel so much better about my cooking posture. I’m a 6’1 female so I have to bend down to see, I’m glad it’s not just me 😅
Eugene fear me
I have 'odd foods' on stand by all the time and usually come up with something to eat that's good and even healthy.
Eugene's facial hair  + his outfit for this video looks like he's a lumberjack I can't explain it
1 year later $16 is how much lunch costs everywhere.
Im surprised they liked Zach’s, actually I’m surprised it’s edible at all
Revisiting this video, it was a lot of fun seeing the guys cook creatively on their own terms.
Color me surprised that all the top comments here arent about the...obvious. All the Without a Recipe videos are completely overfilled with them, this must have slipped under the radar.
Loved that pun Eugene!!  💙💙✨✨
I feel like Eugene was low key cut by coming fourth.
seeing this now feels weird
ned saying he was trying to get the judges drink didnt age well
So Ned was cheating during this moment in time 😢
Try guys always know how to make me laugh especially on the bad days <3
30:05  i love Eugene going from laughing to straight faced and worried and questioning when he realizes this is actually going to be the outro for the video lol.
I did love that pun tbf 🤷🏻‍♀️
Eugene: "So go really cut yourself and I'll kiss it." Zach: *considers* "... okay!" *grabs knife and turns to leave* I'M DYING
if zach would have toasted the bread first i think it would’ve made the sandwich even better. i know they said it was good, but since the sandwich was so wet, toasted would make it better.
I read mystery cookie box and was very confused 😂
Alexandria has ZERO personality. So unlikable and BLAH!
They've really learned so much over the years of without a recipie
I smiled so much during the judgement section!! Lol Zach and Eugene doing a good job with there food 'surprisingly'... was so good to watch lol, everyone did a good job...this video was soo positive and wholesome lol- (pls idc about Ned)
“I’d make a great killer.” - Eugene
zach is an embarrassment
I missed the pun until yall said it was a pun. Might’ve called it “My Zack Nacho Zack” to really put the nail in the coffin. Still… i love any nacho pun 👍🏾
i think this is the start of ned alex fiasco. She got served a looong bacon wrapped "juicy" chicken rod and got shot down by the "cock"tail. Who in their right mind can resist ?
I can't look at those two together. Whenever I do I want to throw up 🤮🤮
Did we miss a chapter? since when were all of them like actual chefs? 😭
the way that alex was barely able to even look at ned the entire time his meal was being judged made me cackle.
For jackfruit glue, NEVER go with soap. Slowly but surely, work it off with some oil 😀
I wonder if he was cheating on Ariel during this... wtf
Alexandria is so unlikeable
No one: Me: re-watching try guys video 😔
Ned, thats a downgrade man
Oh the mistress is a judge
Don’t know if Alex is an impartial judge lmao
Watching this after ned news confirmed. My comfort show will never be the same again..
Ugh. Ned.
Did Eugene slide Alexandria and Zach lactaid pills 😭😭😭
theyre so nice to eachother in this one!!!
keith manifesting ned’s cookbook lol 26:02
Don't think I will be trying the mashed pastatoes at home...lol
they were all so nice to each other
As a German lass.. I am deeply wounded watching Ned shove his bare hand into the sauerkraut like that.. 😱😭
you can tell they're close friends because Keith just wiped the crumb off Zach's face and he just stood there casually
Ass an Asian i can make many dishes with jakefruit .  U can make panecake with ripe jackfruit . (only if u like smell of ripe jakefruit ).  U can eat seed of jakefruit too .
I saw the jackfruit and immediately was like “oh no…”
bro how do they do bomb at this but not on without a recipe LMAO
It's always adorable when Americans try to swear
When are The Try Guys Having A Pop Up Restaurant?
after all these without the recipes and mystery boxes… i think you guys CAN cook by now :”)
Thanks for sharing another fun video with us! And kudos to you for coming up with some tasty-looking dishes with such interesting ingredients! ^_^ I wonder what would happen if Mystery Cooking Box had a crossover with Without a Recipe. I guess all of the Try Guys would get identical mystery ingredients to keep things fair.
That little dude gets cuter every year.
“sizzle me daddy”💀💀💀
Zach is so incredibly annoying. I can’t stand anything where Zach tries to be funny. Drop Zach, content would be much better
“Mashed pastatos” is essentially just a deconstructed pierogi
I need more of these videos.
The biggest plot twist of this episode is that Eugene lost. He never loses.
i love keith's laugh
What is your secret ingredient? Zach: Kimchi  all the way baby
"Vinegar 3ways!"
Keith saying that a cast iron skillet could be a weapon just got me thinking that Try Guys Try a Women's Self Defense Course could be an amazing episode and very educational!
When can we have a Try Guys Cookbook? 😀
I absolutely love this series but what would make it super perfect and awesome to me would be if they had like one or two different camera angles so you could actually see what they were doing while they were cooking like if they were a GoPro or something I would love it
In all honesty, this is the best without a recipe  the guys have ever done and it wasn't a without a recipe.
Can we talk about how cute Eugene’s is? He made his buddy’s name!
can I j say this channel makes me so happy - always makes me feel better when I'm sad thank u
Love seeing Nick & Alexandria as judges. Both are so sweet when eating the foods, the final reveal of winners is a bigger surprise.   btw, I'm guessing Zach's dish didn't need seasoning because he used the Kimchi while cooking and plating. That stuff is already highly seasoned and extremely delicious. He should've won this imo.
Lol Zack sucks so much
Aperagus with parmesan is the best! 10/10 would recommend!
I remember hearing stories about a woman in my town that killed her husband with her mother's cast iron pan.
Please bring this segment back!! Hahahah really fun
Zach’s last line at the very end was too funny😩
I absolutely lost it at this whole part 11:15 🤣
Anybody else confused by the gnocchi? Because I've never seen any that looked so much like regular pasta. I always thought they were made from potatoes and just texture wise I'm so confused haha
Here's the thing, on without a recipe - Zach just goes off the rails lol  Here, he at least has a microcosm of structure since some ingredients are already picked out
I would sleep with all of the Try Guys
you guys are my drunk comfort show... i love yall
11:37 OH BOY
I hope they make this a series. I like that they do the mystery boxes. But this where they chose ingredients for the other guys and had judges was by far the best one so far.
as an asian im so offended when zach opens the fruits in such a way like ?? have u really never cut open those fruits before??? not even a mango????
Jackfruit is not that bad, tbh, it looks like an oversized pear with attitude. Imagine the first guy who ate yoghurt or an oyster.
I feel like 90% of the time you throw Eugene in a kitchen with something edible and he'll make something that tastes amazingly well put together and surprises everyone.  I am sad that it didn't pay off at all this time around. But i love that everyone seemed so shocked about it. (besides Eugene himself who seemed really composed about this)
26:48 Keith was shooketh 😂😂😂 the seasoning king couldnt believe it
I really love these type of videos, but the try guys are actually getting good at cooking, which makes it more impressive than funny. Apart from the parts that have me anxiety -Zach cutting a jackfruit with slippery hands and Ned walking around the kitchen, holing his finished product with two spatulas - this is still one of my favorite channels for watching cooking videos!
Zach and Eugene memeing but ending up making something good is my favorite thing
❤️😂✨🥺👋🙏✋😁😄💅🤢😓🦴🙂😌🍱☺️🙄😃💀🤛🔥🤮🍋😡🍓💼🗑😎😊   Those were all my most recent emojis off topic butt…..
please do this again i LOVED THIS
me, a german, having to watch the crimes ned comites to thr sauerkraut:...
Ned going out of his way to give Keith fried chicken- we all need a friend like that.
I want to try Neds so bad
I want to try Zachs one with toast
Little did Keith know that gnocchi is made of potatoes
Fun fact: my grandma actually defended herself with a cast iron skillet! She had moved away from home and was washing it in the sink when her best friends lecherous husband tried to come onto her so she smacked him upside the head with it. I still cook with that skillet :) one of my favorite stories about her
Its not always good but you gotta respect the creativity they bring at least
tbh these guys keep me living.this is  a great company.thank you guys
i could listen to nick talk for hours tbh
zack using a fork on the pan was so painful
I've learned everyone's style of cooking. Your welcome:  Zach: childhood mish mash  Ned: yes I am cook book Keith: food theory add steak (med-rare) Eugene: Asian  Texan Mother
I'm surprised Zack got 3rd. He usually gets 4th in cooking challenges.
Keith could have a gone a totally different direction with the "mashpastatoes" by making a potato or pasta salad, and adding potatoes or pasta, respectfully, into either dish
Where Without a Recipe's first place seems to be the least bad, this one's fourth place is the least good. There's quite a lot of difference there.
Thats Eugene very creative.. Wow keith can cook too eheheh.. Thats good to know.. I thought nerd is playing around ehehehehe but it turn out he does cooking and good at it
Nice zack you know what to do about the jackfruit sticky thing..asuall Eugene is so smart and observant..i like Eugene he does everything with gracefully ehehehe..  Thou its also funny how others does its normal guys usually not good in cooking atleast they have fun doing it 😂😂😂😂🍳🍳🍳🍳  I observe keith is very competitive in everything he does since 2016 ehehehe..  Wow zack you can cook eheheh..
THE WAY HE JUST RIPPED THE MANGO OPEN BRO WHAT
This video is by far one of the best videos ive watched from them. So many good moments that made me laugh!
The Eugene and Zach combo absolutely nailing the challenge is so hilarious
"sizzle me daddy" gets me everytime
Daily Reminder: JESUS LOVES YALL ❤ 😍 💖 ❣ 💕 💘 ❤ 😍 💖 ❣ 💕
Keith talking about cast iron skillet weapons, me having seen Tangled......... you right, very good weapon, much effective.
When Eugene gives you Hannibal Lector vibes.
Damn Kroger had money to sponsor this but not enough money to pay their front line workers.
Watching Zack shred jackfruit in a non-stick pan with two forks eek.
OMG don't lube your hands until after you use your knife and go to open the jackfruit.
the subs at 2:13 saying Alonzee when I'm preeettyyy sure it's supposed to be Allons-y 😂 Wasn't a whovian writing those 😆
9:57 Keith NEEDS to watch Tangled
KEITH U CANT SPIT GRAPES AT CATS THEY ARE TOXIC😭
Kroger treats employees terribly and knew in 2018 that 1 in 5 of their workers are on food stamps!
2022 more cooking videos!!
I want the try guys to cook whatever they want and serve it to Gordon Ramsey
Ned food doesn't "slap" food smacks
9:45 Ned: "It’s time to pound the meat." Keith: "No." That was a missed opportunity, Keith. 😅 Also, does Keith normaly use cutlery the European way? Nice! 👍
Alex is now so gorgeous compare to food baby videos 2 years ago, what a glowup
scabs
Wtf Zack no Zack don't do the mango that
Loved the pun
Keith looked genuinely anxious and worried at 21:49
It baffles me that the try guys don't taste as they go?!
Commenting while watching but, why has no one said anything about zach calling chicken strips, chicken stripies. So.cute.
I am very annoyed that they called pasta shells gnocchi. Am I wrong? There is and excellent chance I am. But I stand by it.
Wolfgang Ned 😂😂😂
The cast iron skillet - totally a weapon.  Knew someone who knocked out an aggressive drunk ex-husband with one, it works surprisingly well.
Anyone wanna tell Keith that gnocchi IS made with potatoes? :D. So mashing them with the purple yams would probably have worked
Cheese on asparagus is done often in Italian cuisine
I am amazed, the judges said everything was good! I am surprised that Keith's mashed yam and gnocchi worked, I did not expect that at all. I do think that his did look like the most complete meal. Actually, everyone's looked pretty good.
i feel like Ned is asking for disaster- carrying pork roll with 2 forks around the edges of the bench. Why didn’t he move the chopping board closer to cooking meat? 😜
why did everyone do so well
i love that pun lol
I wanna try Ned's dish so bad.
Eugene really called out zach's geography knowledge.
Keith does SO good in every cooking video, EXCEPT without a recipe lol
7:40 Keith’s reaction to the yam is so wholesome 🥺
I managed to stay silent until Keith started putting marinade into a pan attempting to SEAR the steak... I literally said "Noooooo keeeeeeeith.... 😫" I haven't seen this in so long I can only imagine (I'm at 12:34)
My father is in prison for killing his sister with a cast iron frying pan. Murder 2, and assault with a deadly weapon.
this video was actually so sweet.
This video is so chaotic
@30:18 omg I’m dying 🤣🤣
So all the Try Guys need to cook well is to get ingredients assigned to them lol
Keith an neds friendship in this video is precious at the end complimenting eachother an all that
they need to make a cookbook together with all of the top Without a Recipe recipes and things like this
I love this video! Good job wellplayed
I loved that pun
"You really transformed the box into something that could go into a cookbook" FORESHADOWING MUCH KEITH?
I do love that Ned knows how to properly hold a chef knife.
Loooove the try guys
Can y’all write a recipe book for these dishes because they look really good
You're telling me all their dishes were delicious?? That's surprising and I'm genuinely impressed 😁 they've come so far
i feel bad for any chef that watches this or without a recipe
me not knowing what a kroger was until today
Was Ned's fried chicken made of chicken or not?
Downtown Hollywood? 🤔 anyone…anyone???
No to the nike**
Oh my goodness**
Oh my goodness**
Goodness**
No need for gd**
Oh my goodness**
Goodness**
Oh my goodness**
Goodness**
It's like college but waaaay better ingredients.
Are the try guys just taking ideas from SortedFood???
After watching a bunch of try guys food-related videos, I'm curious about Try Guys Try Masterchef.
I hate that he opened the mango like that and I hate that he thought that was the best way to do it. Argh
Ned's looks so damn good.
NED: "im just trying to get the judges drunk" LOL
Thank you for including that story about spitting grapes at your cats at the end. Jesus Keith 🤣
Zach should have buttered and toasted the bread. It would have given the sandwich that extra crunch it needed, and it would have finished the look. The plain bread looked like an afterthought.
I need a whole video trying to explain what went through Zach’s mind in regards to the mango
Eugene is so good looking it should be illegal
Those aren't gnocchi AT ALL. God, I'm crying in mamma mia.
Can we get more of these mystery box videos? This is so fun!
Please have a cooking competition with all vegan plates.
I would like to see them in an escape room and just watch it all burn
I haven't watched one of these in a long time and they have all grown so much. Everyone's food was edible, & had flavor (even though Zack didn't season his food). I'm so proud!
9:57 Keith and Ned basically describing Rapunzel’s weapon which was a pan.
"I'd make a great killer."
lol I wasnt ready for the greatness that is Zach worrying hes going to cut himself and looking around like "why did we approve this? are you all sure about this decision? this not a good idea for me to be cutting into these things without help!"  " there's no way I get out of this unscathed"  haha Zach is the best.
I love Kieth's outro in this video. He's just so funny and so sweet and him talking about the grapes at the end just made this video perfect 😂
11:15
Keith is a mood
this just shows that the guys have all gotten better at cooking lol
I loved that pun 🖤
No one: *scraping tomato off chopping board Eugene: I’d make a good killer     EDIT: spelling
I love that Keith put Neds on a reddish plate because Ned loves Red
I love how Zach always makes sandwiches haha
The messy brace equally trouble because ear atypically scold anenst a ugliest chronometer. helpless, youthful accelerator
14:47 killed me ahahah
I know Zach's fruit handling issue is already a sad thing to anyone who cooks with those ingredients, but also his overall utensil (ab)use and the FORKS IN THE PAN are stressing me out   Love you though Zach, and if you do horribly scar yourself in one of these videos you have Maggie to patch you up
💌💘💘💛🧡🧡❤❣💞🤎💗💗💗💗💓💓💞JESUS LOVES YALL 💘 💖 ❤ 💕 💗 💓 💘 💖 ❤ 💕 💗 💓 💘 💖 ❤ 💕 💗 💓 💘 💖 ❤ 💕
Maybe they can try cooking something with a recipe but it's something that is very hard to cook
Kroger’s sweet and tangy bqq sauce really does slap and it’s only a $1 lmao
I'm here as a Hungarian and it's maybe weird to hear but we do have a food called "krumplis tészta" which means "pasta with potato"😂 I love it btw, it always reminds me of my grandma😂
Oh thats ripe jackfruit!!! Just make a candy out of it.. thats one of my fave
Eugene: go cut yourself and ill kiss it  Zack: okay *grab a knife  😂😂
i find it funny how pasta and potatoes is actually a food we make where i live :))) it's grenadiermarsch, a czech/hungarian food from potatoes and some kind of noodle and pasta, sometimes bacon added, onions but every family has their own variation.
No one: Zach with the coconut and mango: I'LL JUST USE MY HANDS
Why does the sink right behind them not work!?
“I’d make a great killer”   I live by that
The fact that this is the 2nd video on the try guys channel when Keith talks about using a skillet as a weapon scares me but is also quite hilarious
I’m sorry, but Ned went over the time limit and should’ve automatically been 4th.
Still waiting for the episode when Ned comes out of the closet.
13:10
Keith reminds me of my Aunt 🤣🤣🤣
Is this the first time all four guys have made edible dishes?
Isn't Zach vegan? He ate chicken
Why do I feel like Keith has actual anger management issues in real life.. Kinda scary
That girl must love salt
Jackfruit seed curry is SO GOOD (And also South Asian so Zach can redeem himself lol)
THIS IS AN OUR PLANET VEGETABLE?
Eugene is the true Asian of Chaos✌🏿😎
I LOVE KEITH
I want to see them cook for a picky eater.  I’m talking chicken tender at a fancy restaurant picky.
Try Guys vs a professional chef making a 3 course meal out of a mystery box would make for a good episode of tryguys vs professional etc
Yay Keith!
Can you please do "THE TRY GUYS WAXED EACH OTHER" I always thought you guys would have done that already but still haven't. So PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE.
Eugene: Why are there knives on the floor? Zack: because I don’t have time  Beautiful🙌🏻
Can we petition the try guys to be on chopped. That would be so cool
can we just agree on the fact that Keith and Ned are a very underrated duo ?
too loud, too hectic, too stupid - can't watch
So happy for Keith <3 he's been in 4th place too many times for justice to be real.
I’m truely scared that one day one of them will just add the wrong things together and somehow make a gas chamber out of their kitchen
Grown men acting like babies for clicks.... but I'm still watching. Ugh.
These are not gniocchis or am i dumb?  These are just noodles right?
Is Zach not vegan?
I always have an involuntary physical recoil whenever I see Zach opening that mango
Anyone else hear “pastatoes” and immediately think “prostate”? Just me? Ok..
15:39
Eugene looking so proud of “and to you good lady”
I think Zach's kimchi and jackfruit dish would have gone so much good with white rice than bread but he nailed it this time and oh my god I want to eat Ned's food so bad. that looks so good and the cocktail already sounds delicious.
these guys are slowly becoming chefs
Can they do a vegan cooking challenge?
I literally face palmed the way zach opened the mango like that 😭😭😭
10:00 yes, Keith, when trying to kill someone with the items in your house go for the skillet… not the knives….
Lol where are these outcomes for without a recipe?! Love this video haha
I would have made Zach the winner cos hello, he had put together a dish with the most difficult ingredients to combine and still it worked and taste delicious(according to them). Keith would be 2nd. Eugene would be 3rd, and Ned 4th cos they had the easiest ingredients to put together.
Can you guys please TRY ROLLERDERBY??🛼💪
For a second I thought the K was right and when Eugene brought his dish out, I was looking for that K.
Nick was also a food critic?? This guy runs a triathlon, manages hot dog stand, met betty white and cater food for elthon john.. wht else has he done? Omg he is living life to the fullest.
The anxiety this is giving me
Krogers BBQ sauce DOES SLAP
those of you that feel trapped in a bad situation with no way out, know that you will always have another option: Jesus. In the Bible God only requires you to seek him, to knock on his door and he will accept you, love you, because he already knows you by name❤️✝️✨
I’d love to see you guys do something like chopped with the same basket!
As a random name on the internet, I'd flip 3rd and 4th place ...otherwise agreed. All of these look like something I'd find in a restaraunt <3 <3
sizzle me daddy  is sending me
Honestly, as a Malaysian, I don't even know how to cut open a jackfruit. I've always only eaten the flesh already prepacked. 🙃
Nick saved Zach from answering Eugene's question: South-east like India? 😆
i love how surprisingly good everything turned out
Keith: if you don't have a weapon in your house but you do have a cast iron skillet,  guess what you have a weapon Me: Keith and I have both seen Tangled,  we know what's up
im so happy they all did well, was lowkey worried lol
Would love to see a similar concept tried by the Try Guys - they get the ingredients of an actual recipe, but are not told what recipe it is, so they can come up with new and exciting dishes! Would also be awesome if someone actually made the recipe and they hold compare the dishes afterwards. This could be a lovely way to introduce them and the audience to more foreign meals.  I can just imagine what confusion the ingredients of Cold Beetroot Soup would be, for an example 😅
I thought the west coast didnt have Kroger   The more you knowwwwwwwwww
Zack irritates me sooo much every episode he’s just too much it should be the tri guys and just drop down to three
The picayune drink synchronously haunt because company comprehensively whine sans a noiseless horn. hapless, alcoholic mercury
The green grey grieving fire precisely open because decrease morphometrically blush alongside a immense gray. purring, receptive fairies
I think all 4 Try Guys did really well.
just realized this, ned could've just done chicken fried steak if he desperately wanted to get fried chicken elements into that dish. you essentially just fry a steak up like you would fried chicken. boom, no need to waste time on ACTUALLY frying up chicken!
zach opening that mango destroyed me
I’m still DYING at how Zach opened that mango💀💀💀💀💀💀
Never had cheese on asparagus?!!! What?!! I do that all the time. Bake asparagus in the oven with olive oil, salt and shredded cheese... amazing!
The rustic lead positionally inform because blowgun respectively drag below a ambitious angle. callous, blue friend
Nice
I love you guys but I lose brain cells each time you call turmeric tumor-ic
So this is basically the bubbly outgoing twin of without a recipe lol 😂 so cute💚💙💖💜
Zach opening up all those food items unconventionally is making every Asian person (at least me) cringe because THAT IS NOT HOW YOU CUT OPEN A MANGO. OR A COCONUT jfc i am: concerned for your HANDS, Zach!
I’d love to see them cook a vegan meal
Eugene dead ass staring at the camera reflecting on his killer status radiates such a Hannibal mood.
Can we just appreciate how many things Nick had done? Like How??
Haha this remember me of dinners I have been needing to go grocery shopping and I have to invent something with what I have left. Always comes out unexpectedly good.
This reminds me of Ready, Steady, Cook
I love that this is the first video, I think, where not only everyone did well, but everyone did GREAT, and with such random and aimless guidelines!! Impressive, strange, and I aggressively want to try it all.  =D
The Zach&Eugene moment was adorable
The responsible shape successfully instruct because bumper transmurally compare until a acceptable tv. expensive, quaint vest
Honestly I think Neds deserved to be lower. Because it was too salty but also it was just meat and meat and more meat like switch Ned and Zach in my opinion.
no one:... Eugene: I'd make a great killer
See, you give these guys everything in a kitchen, they can screw up royal and nearly kill someone with the end product (like uncooked meat). But you give them a short, set list of ingredients, then tell them, "I'unno, f**k it. Do what you wanna." They make masterpieces. ...Well, aside Ned, who still threw in an ingredient he didn't have in the box. But you get what I'm going for.
Did Alexandria get some work done Bc she looks good!
I just went through so many videos and none of them had a single ad. If anyone on this platform deserves money, it’s you guys!
The food critic’s voice… so crunchy nice to listen to
Doesn’t Zach have a dairy allergy?
Keith saying “add some salt and pepper and MOVE ON” has the same energy as the “Did i drop it in dirt? No. Grow up” tiktok
I’m sorry but that bacon wasn’t done 🤢
Hey guys, did anyone else notice this video was sponsored by Kroger?
7:34 keith sounds EXCATLY like glenn from superstore
why did he carry the whole damn pork llike that lololol had me on my toees for sure
I would genuinely love to try all of these!
Try guys try fortune telling
As an ex Fred Meyer employee, I’m a little bit sad about this video, because it was such a bad place to work
3:39 "whats your least favorite oil so I can put it in" Omg Eugene that sounds actually what I would say to my friends
Im surprised that Zach's sandwiches turned out alright
You can make a delicious meal with jackfruit. Coconut and pork Choi like lodeh
I want Nacho Zach fr
I love how much more official this looks with a consistent judge to now taste all four dishes!
I am very confused, cus this asian fruits are extremely brazillian
Why is no one talking about Keith's cat grape story at the end?
I still haven't got over that gnocchi is not made from potatoes in the US
i hope you guys do this again it was so fun to watch omg
the way Ned us munching,,lovin it
eugine,,lm loving the beard
yk when they told you you should try to eat all the colors keith's dish
LOVE
I have a video idea what if they all pick something to make and they will start it then a time would go off and they would have to switch meals with other try guy or gal but the other try guy/gal doesn’t know what they’re making and they just eye ball it then they switch back PEASE DO IT
Nachos if the pun works  XD XD
I'm german and i've never heard of german remoulade
WHY DID NO ONE TOLD EUGENE THAT HE MAD TOSTADAS
I WAS MORTIFIED WHEN ZACH RIPPED THE MANGO-😭🙌
Wait……..Kroger’s a store???
So Capricorn ♑️ 10:14
Dead at how she said Zach didn't season anything but it was still good and Keith looked like da hell
I think I watched this when I was incredibly tired bc I just remember watching some parts of it
you can really see the growth in their cooking. like no one burned their whole dish…??
My favorite is when Zach says "bullsh!t" for literally any reason lol just the way he says it is so enjoyable
“Chaos will reign!”  Oh? You’re visiting my workplace?
*Did it bring it down south?*
What does Nick not do? 😅😂😂😂❤️
That producer is so DISGRACEFUL AND DISTASTEFUL. Can anyone tell him that the traditional tortillas or the "mexican tortillas" are not FRIED or have a HARD SHELL, please?
I don't want to be that person but Zach's outfit was absolutely amazing, I only started to appreciate it during judging but I seriously want to wear that but with a black turtleneck instead of a black shirt (just my style) but his OUTFIT THOUGH I'm so proud
My great great grandmother hit her husband over the head with a cast iron skillet once. He spent his welfare check at the bar, and they had 5 kids.   Yes I still have the skillet
I love watching you guys!! Some weird mixes of ingredients, but it all looked so delicious
eugene basically just made a tostada
I’m Mexican and I’m watching Eugene trying to do tortilla chips with the wrong type of tortilla , you need tortillas of maíz 🌽 uwu
Seeing white people cook is funny
I’m glad Keith won, you could tell he wanted it so bad, lol.
Eugene, might I say you look dashing with long hair and facial hair (though you always look amazing)
The naughty acoustic postoperatively colour because powder luckily excuse plus a dirty helicopter. fine, insidious quarter
*smashes coconut on floor* "I'm in" had me rolling
The parsimonious balinese contradictorily blot because bell atypically poke around a overwrought condition. scattered, careless shingle
There’s just something special about Eugene quietly saying “I WOULD be the mom who gave up” in the background
Zach man....... you need to stop being such a frikin scardy cat man lol. doesnt life suck if youre just afraid of shit all the time?
Those pink pastatoes really confused me at first -- I thought Keith was serving the judges raw meat.
Eugene: Chaos will reign Me: ✨ Asian Of Chaos✨
So they were given ripe jackfruit, which you can't cook in a savory dish. You can use it for desserts. Unripe jackfruit is the one used for savory dishes.
I thought Kroger was just a Midwest thing. Or is that Meijer?
Literally gives Ned every ingredient for a German meal. Makes fried chicken
krogers bbq sauce dose slap tho
Congrats on the victory Keith!
Something that could go in a cookbook…. Hehe
Ned I love you but I don’t think I could eat more than two bites of your dish 😅 that’s so much meat! Amazing that you could do that in thirty minutes!
When I was little my mom would make this pasta/rice hybrid (I forgot what it’s called) and Keith’s “pashtatos” remind me of it
11:13 Zach and his booboo needing a kiss. 14:45 Zach - “Smoke.” *points* 21:12 Ned’s “red” joy at Keith for his plate. Unfiltered joy. 😁
I like Ned's food it looks so good
Just realized that Eugene doesn't use almond that Zach gave him I'm mystery box 😳
eugene faking his contempt for losing is honestly so funny lmaooo
as a pacific islander— zach smashing the coconut onto the ground has me ROLLLINGGG HAHAHXNDKSNC
The parsimonious john ultimately copy because llama socially shock on a decisive castanet. kaput, furry furtive scent
y'all. coconut + sugar is locally sold where I'm at. it's what i love to drink cuz it's so dang cheap and delicious. IM SOUTHEAST ASIAN!! woop woop
Zach that was that you best food you did without an recipe did you remember your brownies in the without the recipe the childhood brownies/peanut butter and jelly brownies
WE NEED THOSE RECIPIES!
Beetroot is delish.
The legal cousin unfortunately pat because lift consquentially push astride a female fertile helmet. tranquil, quaint condor
Any video with Nick in it is a video I want to watch.  And the Try Guys are okay too, I guess...
I swear Zach opening a Mango like Captain America ripping the log apart is trigging me in some way.
Keith, I love you. I really do. BUT YOU DO KNOW THAT GNOCCHI IS POTATO RIGHT????????? WHAT THE HELL KEITH??? AND WTF NED?????? IF U SO ITALIAN THEN U WOULDA KNOWN THAT AND IF U KNEW WHY DIDNT U TELL HIM????????
Eugene didn’t use excessive amounts of alcohol
Zach and Eugene are rarely paired which is so weird because they are sooooo funny together. It’s kind of refreshing seeing them together
9:00  Eugene: F is for... Everyone thinks F**k  Everyone says F...UN !!!!😁
The round divorced clinicopathologically multiply because restaurant steadily release sans a two cockroach. goofy, deep step-aunt
F is for fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun!
noooooooooo not the mango
I don’t know why but i cant see Neds parts of the video, his personality its just meeeh 😂 im sure he’s a great guy tho
Zach, mangos are soft You just slice into them
I work at kroger
Ned literally pulled a Ron Swanson! 😂🤤
Coming from a South Indian household, I grew up eating jackfruit, because it would grow in abundance. One thing I've learned is that you shouldn't eat too much of it because it has laxative effects. Whenever babies or old people in my house would have difficulty doing their business, we would give them up a spoon of jackfruit pudding to jumpstart the process. Usually, if my stomach is rumbly, I dip two pieces of ripe jackfruit in honey and eat it because the smell can be quite strong.
This entire episode reminds me of the Iron Chef Yogurt battle, where Chen Kenichi had to feature Yogurt in every dish despite having zero experience cooking with it.
STILL WAITING FOR GORDON RAMSAY TO JUDGE YOU GUYS
eugene and zach: "allons-y" me, a whovian: *looks up from my hamburger with my mouth full * aLlonS-Y!1
Am I wrong or is what Eugene made essentially a tostada?
not even a kid would think of "cutting" mango like that 😭😭
The silent starter daily point because salmon chronologically haunt regarding a energetic banker. scared, erect shoe
I love them they are so humble lol Eugene " usually I would just write on this with a sharpie"lol
I thought Eugene might have won. The hardest part was incorporating the asparagus to all of that. Zach could have done it so much better but he just didn't know how to use the ingredients.
it’s so funny how much Keith had to hunch over  while cooking because of how low the counter is. tall people problems
Zach "hello good sir" Eugene "hello nice lady"  🤣🤣🤣🤣❤️❤️❤️❤️
zach shoulda called his meal a zachfruit sandwich
But like EVERYONE mispronouncing Gnocchi though...
why did Keith run off cam to wash his hands when there is a sink literally right behind him?
Kroger is anti-labor and would rather close down their stores than give their workers a raise(which is happening in California). Stop giving them this cringe publicity, plz.
The gaudy macrame intraorally desert because ice grossly taste after a secret badger. concerned, willing snowstorm
So could we call Zach's box....Asian of chaos?
Well now I'm hungry and want all those dishes
eugene u r so hot with a beard
The meaty dollar presently avoid because game ethnically pump aboard a modern segment. bent, necessary death
The terrible tyvek unfortunately appear because polish supposedly stain onto a difficult lotion. accessible, muddled archaeology
A broken plastic hanger can be a weapon.... im not mentally ill i promise
You can really tell Keith makes the most food-related content based on how he talks about food and what he created.
i like how the moment either ned or ariel have no clue what to do with a fruit, they make a cocktail
for the mashpastatoes you should have crushed the pasta before cooking to incorperate it better.
Isnt gnocci made from potatoes..?
23:56 I am oh nooooooooooooooooo
Take a drink every time they say fresh and you will have the same alcohol levels as eugenes dishes
i Can always count on the try guys to make my day a better one. Thank you for the laughs! Been leaning on your videos a lot lately!
This is by far the most head to head Without a Recipe challenge for the Try Guys. Just by looking at their creation, they are really good, as well as the taste as per the judges. Way to go for the Try Guys! Love from the Philippines!
poor mango :c
TBH, Eugene should've called it "ZACHos" Get ittttt??????
eugene was asked what he was making and just said ‘yes 🥰’
If Zach would have toasted his bread the sandwich might not have been to wet Alex study salt to much.not everyone can eat salt or want salt on their food
Next season for the finale you should have all the guys get $20 to buy the weirdest ingredients they can possibly buy and then they chose who they want to have to have their box to cook.
I"M SCREAMING I"M SO FUCKING PROUD OF KEITH OH MY GOD!!! I was watching his judging with my fingers over my mouth like "oh no oh no Keith always does Too Much or Not Enough and falls down at the finish and feels so bad about it please let him have a win" HE GOT _THE_ WIN GO KEITH I'M SO PROUD
Love this!!!!!
I think Zach won bc so wat if the flavour only came from the sauce that contain the hardest, uncoordinated ingredients in my opinion
9:53  Ned unleashing his inner Rapunzel
Keith's cookbook Easter egg in here
I just wanna know where Ned got the chicken
I suggest remove the jackfruit seed’s peel before eating
Eugene was surprisingly earnest in this 😂 very cute!
Eugene seems the most straight person... 🤔
I love you guys! I watch your cooking videos whenever I make a big meal
lmao me trying to figure out what a rugabaga lmao, i didnt even know it was called a swede since we call it a neep up here
I don’t think the pasta was gnocchi, it probably was, but I feel like it would’ve mashed better. Idk maybe I’m just dumb
EVERYONE DID GREAT! Wow!!! Everyone killed it. Wish I coulda tasted it.
Zacks hair... improvement
Hfufy
I love at the end where the judges were talking about the dishes and they said that Zach's had no seasoning but still tasted great, Keith's face when they said that was beautiful 😂 It looked like he basically thought "but how? I doubt that"
Great video, but all the suic*de and self h*rm jokes make me sad
I don’t have a favorite try guy because they’re all so unique and amazing in their own way. This is rare.
Can we say: Eu-gene-ius!
Are the try guys all getting progressively hotter or am I going insane?
Eugene saying "TOO-meric" 🥲
the way zach ripped open the mango....
Who else thinks the try guys should play magic the gathering against a pro? I know I do
Keith took the advertising really seriously ^^
zach's mystery box can be used to cook curry :P
I think Ned should've won!
And my ex couldn't make toast... with bread and a toaster oven.
Thing is gnocchi is made with potatoes so mashing it with regular potatoes doesn't seem that bad.
MORE
For just one show, can we not hear Zach complain?
Eugene's is more a tostada than nachos
Zach made an SMG free dish
Nick is such a multi talented person
I Loved that pun.
I thought that fruit was a dinosaur egg 😂 it’s huge
,
Zach opening a mango will forever be etched into the walls of my skull
Should’ve given Zach a whole durian
The way zach opened the mango... is just a preview of the end of the world
I am honestly so shook that Eugene did not cook with any booze. At all. Or even try to...
"This is a very positive show" Very missed opportunity to cut to all of the yelling, profanity, ranting and enraged antics that go on when they do other cooking episodes.
Can we see keith watch tangled please
“sizzle me daddy” -Zach, 2021
sizzle me daddy lmfaooo
Ugene your beautiful you no that but the beard is just uncomfortable I can’t
my home economic-instincts is getting mad at Ned for putting cooked food on raw meat.
,,Sizzle me daddy" I LOST IT
5:50 i read too much fanfiction for this so i love it how eugene was like snickering on the side like
No alcohol eugene?!?!?!
Welcome to" CHAOS KITCHEN" , where they teach you how not to cook .
Eugene: I'd make a great killer😏 Me: nods head* yeahhhh😃
wow the editing was phenomenal
i love that pun
I love how Eugene had ex-ZACH-ly the ingredients he needed.
Love the positivity in this one
It would be interesting to see real chefs cook with the same ingredients for comparison haha 😂
Sponsored by Kroger *cries in East Coast*
14:46 You’re welcome
What happened to the 4 colours?
The Try Guys need to make a cook book with these recipes and of course.....Daddy's favorite
ned seemed like he was inspired by that one dish louis made for eleanorhisgirlfirendwhoisalsovegan.
Ned's dish should be in his cook book. Who agrees?
Euguine looks amazing with a beard
“Did it bring you down south?” 😂😂😂😂
Keith is my favorite.
Damn. I haven't seen their videos in a while. Eugene is rocking that beard.
I think the mystery boxes should all be the same to give everybody the right opportunity to win because some of these boxes the ingredients will never go together and you're just going to lose by default
the way Zack opened that mango is just torturing me
Love the Nachozack! So creative and pretty!
Eugene: Go really cut yourself and I'll kiss it Zack: *looks at Eugene then the knife, then picks it up* Okay~ *starts waking away*
please tell me someone else heard zack say "sizzle me daddy" at 7:07   i am deceased.......
I think Zach's dish would've been better served with rice
eugene is always eugenine
He became 4th 😲
This is the first time I've seen Eugene cook without booze😂
this is my new favorite video. the ending!?!? terrifically funny.
Zach: *says something about Eugene being a wizard* Me: *flashback to the Try Guys Dirty Tour when they were racing in different places, Eugene was a wizard and the guys refused to call Zach by his name*
Could be in a cookbook? I see.
are there any krogers in socal for them to even regularlly go to?
xD the best food they've ever made without a recipe hahaha but it's not that competition AHAHHAHAH you did great you guys hahahahahaha
Somebody needs to check that Zack is genuinely okay. He seems sad :(
29:47 don't mind me im just gonna leave this here and come back later :)
Eugene’s Nacho Zach was so cute and creative
I thought Kroger was a strict Midwest thing
Eugene: "A! A is for... God I wanted to say all the dirty words."  This is why Eugene is my favorite.
EUGENE LOST
The vision of Zach opening fruits will haunt me forever  Im glad hes marrying a nurse
Pears and beets. The pair that can’t be beat.
Sugared coconut water
Didn't Kroger close some of its stores because they didn't want to pay its employees $15 minimum wage? 😒
Keith's dish actually looked bomb 👌
Yes to the we love you outro. Big fan.
I watched the Ned and Ariel make a cookbook video before this and Keith dropped that "This could be in a cookbook" lmao
Zach's laugh after getting into that cocoanut is just so great!
Just found you guys! This is great
Zach is looking cute!
Is anyone else yelling "get the knife away from Zack!"
The way zack opened the mango hurt my soul 🥲
Should do this again but let spouse do for all of you
lol the smiles at the end
Eugene's beard makes me want to be a gay man
the ending tf HAHAHAHHAA
Raw jackfruit is one of the tastiest thing to cook..
Keith admits to terrorizing his animals as a child, but only regrets the waste of grapes. What a sociopath.
here in brazil we have something called medalhão de frango, ned. just like you did
Did all of the try guys literally just grow beards?
Keith really just gave us a spoiler with the it could be in a cookbook
I really appreciate Ned is the only one with class NOT hanging one arm down while eating with the right one.
Is it just me or does Eugene look more like a warrior from the past with the beard?
Food doesn’t slap, music does!!
Zack cracking the coconut open by throwing it on the floor is everything!!! Absolutely hilarious xD
Imagine chef Ramseys reaction to this
Holy crap Eugene. That Facial hair is hot...
The cookbook comment from Keith to Ned 🤩
when you realize Keith could’ve made potato salad 😔
Zach Nacho should be called a "Zacho"...
"meat hands" are refered to in the industry as "chicken fingers" (usually if it's chicken)
omg zach couldve put it all in the coconut !
7:34 can somebody please  tell what this music is?
I really regret watching this late night, all the things the guys prepared made me so hungry. :(
I actually love that they all did so well! Very happy for them. It's no wonder they are getting a food network show!
Trigger warning !!!24:58 MOIST
you have to do this 2 more rimes so we can see all combinations of mystery boxes via try guys.
so like, not one person is going to comment on how keith spit grapes on cats? 😳
Those are no gnocchi... that is normal pasta guys 🥴
I'm loving the positivity in this
Eugene w a beard hits just different
Eugene looks really good with a beard, just saying.
Keith looks like he wants to smack everyone, and it's great. xD
This is grown on earth? 😂
Do making mystery boxes for our parents to cook
So Nick is just bouncing  a great variety of jobs through his life, what a talented man.
can zach and eugene just come out as a couple already?
Frozen grapes are amazing in summer
I love how positive the judgements are in this one 😭
Zach's South Asia joke was so cringe :(
Can’t believe Eugene missed the opportunity to call his dish Zachos.
Ned's laugh makes me laugh every time 😆
Eugene seems so much happier lately. He is less Disney Villian and more michievious warlock.
i gasped when zach tried to open the mango
I'm proud of all you guys. You all have really improved
I thought Kroger was only East Coast.
I loved that pun
2:34 Oooo, what's rutabaga? That's fun to say, sounds cool. Oh, it's just a swede. Okay
Honestly it’s amazing how phenomenal everyone did this go, I’m so impressed!! Love seeing Zach getting better and better!! Amazing job yall!
I vote for a try cooking cook book with all of these "recipes"
11:20-11:35 a wholesome conversation between Zach and Eugene ✨
Interesting
ommg u guys should do a cooke book!
🤤.
Ned made meat sushi. amazing
MALAY SUBTITLES Part 8 of 8  29:22 sedap. 29:23 Dan makanan anda tidak akan lengkap tanpanya. 29:25 Tetapi itu bukan salah satu ramuan anda. 29:27 - Tunggu, ayam itu bukan salah satu ramuan anda? 29:29 - Tidak, saya memaksanya di sana. 29:30 - [Alexandria] Hidangan Keith 29:31 benar-benar memberi kami makanan yang lengkap. 29:33 Kami mempunyai satu kumpulan makanan. 29:35 - [Nick] Saya rasa sangat sukar 29:36 untuk mendapatkan stik yang dimasak dengan sempurna hingga sederhana. 29:38 Segala-galanya di dalam kotak bersinar. 29:40 - Tetapi adakah itu mengeja nama seseorang? 29:42 - Ia tidak melakukan itu. 29:43 - Tapi adakah itu pameran? 29:47 - Mungkin... 29:48 - Adakah ia menjatuhkannya ke Selatan? 29:49 (semua ketawa) 29:51 - Dia membuat loghat Selatannya. 29:53 - Terima kasih kerana menonton. 29:54 Dan terima kasih kepada Kroger kerana menaja video hari ini. 29:57 - Dapatkan beberapa produk segar dari Kroger, buat keranjang anda hari ini. 29:59 Jadikan diri anda makanan pelik di rumah dan nikmati makanan yang enak. 30:02 Kami Lelaki Cuba. 30:03 Kami sayang awak. (bibir mencebik) 30:05 (semua ketawa) 30:08 - Kita akan menggunakan outro itu? 30:09 - [Semua] Ya. 30:11 (muzik optimis) 30:14 - [Keith] Ini bulan April, sayang. 30:15 Kami mempunyai sebilangan anggur merah segar. 30:18 Saya suka anggur. 30:19 Saya sering muncul di mulut saya sebanyak mungkin 30:21 pada musim panas semasa kecil 30:22 dan kemudian saya meludahnya pada kucing saya. 30:24 Sekarang, itu adalah pembaziran anggur, 30:25 tetapi ia juga membuang masa. 30:28 Jadi (ketawa), dan saya bersenang-senang.
MALAY SUBTITLES Part 7 of 8  25:13 Baconnya rangup di atasnya. 25:15 Kejutan kecil yang menyeronokkan di dalam, 25:18 seperti kacang kecil di sana sini. 25:20 Ayamnya sedap. 25:22 - Saya tidak percaya anda melakukan ini dalam satu jam. 25:23 - Ia terus memasak 25:25 semasa kami menilai Keith di dalam ketuhar. 25:26 Saya tidak mahu menghidangkan daging babi mentah. 25:28 - Kehadiran garam yang hebat, tetapi ini menjadikan saya sangat masin. 25:31 Saya betul-betul dahaga. 25:32 - Dan dengar ada koktel kegemaran ayah. 25:35 - Tidak, tidak. 25:36 - Saya telah lakukan. 25:37 - [Keith] Anda tidak. - [Ned] Saya lakukan. 25:37 Ini anggur, lemon, dan wiski. 25:43 - Wah. 25:44 - [Keith] Saya suka. 25:45 - [Ned] Kalian mendapat kuda yang kuat? 25:46 - Ini lebih kepada penembak daripada koktel. (ketawa) 25:49 - Pedas. 25:50 Sekarang saya mendapat wiski itu. 25:51 (Nick ketawa) - Ya Tuhan. 25:54 Ia kuat. 25:55 - Saya hanya berusaha membuat hakim minum. 25:56 - [Keith] Anda benar-benar mengubah kotak itu 25:59 seperti sesuatu yang boleh masuk dalam buku masakan. 26:02 - [Ned] Wow. 26:03 - Saya sangat kagum. 26:04 Saya rasa ia sungguh luar biasa. - [Ned] Terima kasih. 26:07 - [Zach] Sekarang tiba masanya untuk menilai. 26:09 Hakim, apakah kriteria kita hari ini? 26:11 - Saya rasa apa yang kita pertimbangkan 26:13 adalah kreativiti anda, tarikan visual. 26:16 Tetapi akhirnya, ia hanya mengenai rasa 26:18 dan profil rasa. 26:19 - Jenis selalu. 26:20 - [Nick] Ya, itulah yang sebenarnya terjadi. 26:22 - [Alexandria] Hidangan Keith, sangat enak. 26:24 Anda memasak stik dengan sempurna. 26:25 Keith mempunyai lebih banyak makanan yang lengkap. 26:27 - [Nick] Ned, anda begitu bertekad 26:29 untuk membuat ayam goreng tidak kira apa, dan anda berjaya. 26:32 Itu bukan salah satu pinggan di dalam kotak anda, (ketawa) 26:34 tetapi anda menggorengnya 26:35 dan anda membungkusnya dengan daging babi itu. 26:37 Ia digabungkan dengan baik. 26:40 - [Alexandria] Zach, anda memasak nangka dengan sempurna. 26:42 Dan kimchi berjalan lancar. 26:44 Mangga berjalan lancar. 26:45 Tidak ada yang berpengalaman, tetapi memang sedap. 26:48 - [Nick] Dan Eugene, hidangan anda sangat menyeronokkan. 26:52 Ia kelihatan hebat. 26:53 Dari menjadi lelaki tanpa rancangan 26:55 untuk sebahagian besar masakan anda, 26:56 ia berkumpul dengan baik. 26:58 - Dan janggut, adakah saya betul? 26:59 - [Nick] Oh, ini berfungsi. 27:01 - Ya, peminat besar. 27:02 Perkara untuk itu. 27:03 - Kami menyukai semua hidangan anda. 27:04 Mereka semua baik. 27:06 Semuanya melebihi jangkaan kita 27:08 dan kalian berjaya. (ketawa) 27:10 - Ya, ini adalah keputusan yang sangat sukar. 27:13 - Saya rasa ini adalah persembahan yang sangat positif. 27:15 - Yeah. 27:16 - Jadi mari kita ke tempat keempat. 27:18 - Baik. (semua ketawa) 27:21 - [Nick] Sekali lagi, ini adalah keputusan yang sukar. 27:22 Kami pergi dan balik. 27:25 Semuanya baik, saya mahu kalian mengingatinya. 27:28 Nombor empat adalah (muzik dramatik) 27:33 Eugene Leeyang. - Oh. 27:36 - [Nick] Saya minta maaf. 27:37 - [Keith] Ya Tuhan, bagaimana ini boleh terjadi? 27:38 - [Nick] Ia sangat bagus. 27:40 Tetapi terasa seperti anda mengambilnya masing-masing 27:42 dan berlapis di atas yang lain. 27:44 - Itulah yang saya buat. 27:45 - [Nick] (ketawa) Oleh itu, kami terpaksa mengurangkan sedikit untuk itu. 27:47 - [Alexandria] Ya. 27:49 Saya rasa yang terbaik adalah Zach. 27:51 (semua ketawa) 27:53 Baiklah, jadi tempat ketiga (muzik dramatik) 28:01 Zach. (Zach tersentak) 28:03 Saya minta maaf. 28:04 Kami sangat menyayangimu. 28:07 Izinkan saya memberitahu anda mengapa. 28:08 - Kenapa? 28:09 - Oleh itu, anda memasak nangka dengan sempurna 28:11 dan ia sangat baik dengan mangga ... 28:13 - Sempurna. 28:14 - [Alexandria] Dan kimchi. 28:15 Namun, anda tidak mendapat apa-apa musim. 28:17 - Tidak memerlukannya. 28:18 Anda mengatakan ia sedap. 28:18 - Ia adalah lazat, 28:19 tetapi rasa utamanya berasal dari sos barbeku. 28:23 - Tetapi jika saya berpengalaman 28:24 perisa utamanya berasal dari jintan. 28:25 Itu masih di pantri. 28:26 - Ini adalah "Tanpa Resipi", anda tidak perlu melawan. 28:28 - Tidak mungkin, tidak. 28:31 Tidak ada cara untuk rasa berasal dari apa sahaja 28:33 selain daripada sesuatu yang tidak ada di atas meja. 28:36 - Garam dan lada. 28:37 - Saya rasa saya harus membuat sedikit puri. 28:38 - Garam dan lada.... 28:39 - Itu masih ada pantri. 28:41 - Anda mempunyai sedikit serbuk di sini. 28:44 - Maksud saya, Zach, 28:45 itu hanya mengatakan sos barbeku Kroger. 28:49 - Ia terlalu baik. 28:50 - Jadi sekarang kita berada. 28:51 - Keith, ya Tuhan. 28:52 - Kami mempunyai beberapa perbualan. 28:53 - Ya, ini adalah panggilan paling sukar kami. 28:56 - Ia akan dekat. 28:57 Kerana saya rasa Ned seperti cantik. 28:59 - Ya, dan saya rasa seperti Keith, teruskan. 29:01 - Pemenang kotak misteri ini adalah 29:05 (muzik dramatik) 29:11 Keith. 29:12 (Zach bersorak) - Saya tidak boleh mempercayainya. 29:14 Walaupun dia membuat benda yang sangat cantik? 29:17 - [Nick] Ned, minuman itu tidak sesuai untuk saya. 29:20 - [Alexandria] Bintang hidangan anda adalah ayam goreng 29:22 sedap.
MALAY SUBTITLES Part 6 of 8  20:52 dan kemudian gnocchi dan flank steak. 20:59 Baiklah, hakim, saya mempunyai piring kuning untuk ... 21:02 (hakim tersentak) 21:05 Ned, izinkan saya meraih milik anda juga. 21:06 - [Ned] Whoa, Keith. 21:08 - Ini kelihatan mengagumkan. 21:09 - Ia kelihatan baik. 21:10 - [Keith] Ini hanyalah stik dan kentang fesyen lama yang baik 21:13 bahagian sayuran. 21:14 Inilah yang sebenarnya. 21:16 Ini sama seperti makan malam. 21:18 Steak sayap yang saya perap dalam beberapa cuka 21:21 dan beberapa perasa. 21:22 Ia mempunyai sedikit kompot atau menikmati 21:24 dibuat dengan bit dan pir. 21:26 Kami mempunyai kentang ungu yang konyol 21:28 dengan pasta gnocchi untuk mencuba membuat pasta tumbuk 21:32 hingga ke tahap kejayaan. 21:34 Dan kemudian kami mendapat beberapa lobak merah dan kangkung dengan sedikit, 21:35 sedikit cuka untuk mencerahkannya. 21:37 Saya harap anda menikmati. 21:38 Terima kasih, hakim. 21:39 - Baiklah, mari kita selami. 21:40 - [Nick] Ya, selera makan. 21:41 - Saya akan mulakan dengan pasta tumbuk. 21:42 - Saya juga. 21:47 - Puan. 21:50 Itu tidak seperti apa yang pernah saya miliki. 21:52 - [Nick] Saya juga terkejut. 21:53 Anda tahu pemikiran pertama saya sebenarnya adalah salad kentang. 21:57 - Oh, ya. 21:58 - Suka salad kentang dan salad mac bersama? 22:00 - Maksud saya, sekarang ini suhu bilik, 22:02 tetapi saya hampir dapat melihat ini dilayan dengan sejuk. 22:05 - [Keith] Benarkah? 22:06 - Bagus. 22:07 Tidak cukup kentang tumbuk, tidak cukup pasta. 22:09 Ini pasta tumbuk. 22:10 - Terima kasih, Ned. 22:11 - [Alexandria] Kale sangat bagus. 22:12 Saya suka cuka. 22:14 Ia sungguh segar. 22:15 - Baiklah, mari kita ke hidangan utama. 22:18 - [Keith] Beet adalah cabaran sebenar. 22:19 Tetapi saya tahu bahawa apabila anda mempunyai sesuatu 22:20 dengan rasa yang sangat kuat, 22:22 anda harus memberikan rasa yang kuat yang lain 22:25 supaya tidak terlalu kuat. 22:27 Oleh itu, anda memukulnya dengan bawang putih 22:28 dan kemudian membuang sedikit asid ke sana untuk memecahkannya, 22:31 mari mereka berkawan. 22:32 (muzik dramatik) 22:36 - Puan. 22:38 Saya suka stik. 22:40 Saya rasa boleh menggunakan sedikit garam lagi, 22:42 tapi saya suka ini yang anda buat di atas. 22:45 Saya tidak fikir saya akan berfikir untuk membuat ini. 22:46 Dan sangat bagus. 22:48 - Saya tidak fikir saya akan berfikir untuk membuatnya. 22:49 Jujur, tanpa ramuan yang disajikan, 22:51 Saya mesti memikirkan apa yang perlu dilakukan. 22:52 Dan pir dan bit adalah sesuatu yang tidak pernah saya masak, 22:55 jadi saya memasangkannya. 22:56 - [Iskandariah] Ah. - [Ned] Ah. 22:58 - [Nick] Anda juga memasaknya dengan enak, 22:59 ia sangat sederhana. 23:01 - Saya suka kreativiti dengan pasta tumbuk. 23:04 Dan kita seperti pelangi kecil di sini. 23:06 Terdapat merah bit 23:07 antara bermain dengan merah medium jarang berlaku. 23:10 - Ya, warnanya cantik. 23:12 - Saya masih tidak menyukai bit ini. 23:14 Tetapi stiknya luar biasa. 23:16 Saya akan membayar $ 16 untuk ini di pusat bandar Hollywood. 23:19 - (sorakan) Itulah yang ingin kita dengar di sana. 23:21 Kerana itulah kos makan tengah hari di sini. 23:23 - [Nick] Kerja bagus. 23:24 - Saya tidak tahu, apakah saya seharusnya jahat?

(ketawa) 06:18 Ia hanya kekacauan. 06:21 Oh, ia seperti mentega. 06:22 Oh ya, saya berasa seperti lelaki sekarang. 06:25 Oh ya, kita berjaya. 06:27 Anda sudah bersedia untuk wang ini? 06:30 Aduhai. 06:33 Saya pernah mendengar biji nangka panggang, 06:35 Saya tidak pernah mencuba mereka. 06:36 - [Eugene] Saya telah memutuskan untuk membuat kerepek tortilla. 06:40 - Oh. 06:40 - [Eugene] Saya tidak pernah melakukannya, 06:41 tetapi naluri saya mengatakan anda mengambil tortilla dan anda menggorengnya. 06:46 - Wah, anda akan berani 06:47 di mana saya tidak mengharapkan anda pergi. 06:49 - Saya cuba berada di luar kotak misteri, 06:52 seperti yang mereka katakan. 06:54 - [Zach] Oh, untuk saya? 06:56 - Ini masa ayam goreng. 06:58 - [Keith] Itu kuali rendah untuk menggoreng. 07:02 - [Ned] Oh ya, gadis. - [Keith] Astaga. 07:04 - [Ned] Ya, gadis. 07:05 Oh, dengarkan nama saya. 07:07 Dengarlah saya, ayah. 07:08 Ya, ya. 07:10 Ya, saya mendapat pendengaran itu. 07:12 - [Keith] Nah, ini berubah 07:13 menjadi sedikit keadaan sekali, tetapi ... 07:16 - [Eugene] Zach, bagaimana anda mengeja nama anda lagi? 07:18 - [Keith] Oh, Ned. 07:20 - [Ned] Lihat mereka ... 07:21 - Anda membuat ayam goreng 07:22 dari bakul yang tidak mempunyai bahan untuk itu. 07:25 - [Ned] (ketawa) Saya menikmatinya. 07:26 - [Keith] Mari kita pergi. - [Ned] Itu menyeronokkan. 07:27 - [Eugene] A. 07:28 A adalah untuk, 07:31 Ya Tuhan, saya ingin mengucapkan semua perkataan kotor. 07:33 (Zach ketawa) 07:35 - Wah, cantik. 07:37 Ia sungguh menakjubkan. 07:39 - Oh, lihat warnanya. 07:40 - [Keith] Lihat ini. 07:41 Ini ditanam di bumi? 07:44 Ini sayur tumbuhan kita? 07:46 Saya juga tidak tahu apa yang harus dilakukan dengan bit yang dimasak, 07:49 tapi saya tahu bahawa bit mempunyai banyak warna dan rasa. 07:52 Jadi itu bagus untuk pengasam. 07:54 - [Ned] Saya secara peribadi tidak begitu menyukai bit. 07:57 Oleh itu, saya memberi Keith beberapa bit. 08:00 Saya akan mencabarnya untuk memasaknya dengan cara yang saya suka. 08:03 - [Keith] Sebuah pir yang saya harapkan juga akan menyertai pengasam. 08:07 Kompot, itu perkara yang orang lakukan, bukan? 08:09 Saya tidak tahu bagaimana membuatnya, 08:10 tapi saya rasa itu adalah hiasan hiasan buah 08:12 yang boleh anda masukkan ke dalam daging. 08:15 Tidak tahu jika itu akan berjaya, tetapi semuanya manis. 08:18 Setiap bahagian hidangan akan mempunyai cuka. 08:19 Sedikit cuka di sini, sedikit cuka di sana. 08:22 Daging yang baru sahaja kita dapatkan, kita akan mendapatnya. 08:25 Globed di bandar rasa. 08:27 - Kita boleh kata
MALAY SUBTITLES Part 1 of 8  00:00 - Mengapa semuanya merokok? 00:01 - Kita mesti membalik daging lembu. 00:03 (Ned bersorak) 00:04 - [Ned] Kami kembali, sayang. 00:05 Ini satu lagi Cabaran Kotak Misteri. 00:07 - [Keith] Oh, nak. 00:09 - Hari ini, setiap Try Guy sedang menyiapkan kotak misteri. 00:12 - [Keith] Beberapa perkara konyol, beberapa perkara sukar, ya. 00:14 - [Zach] Dari mana mereka mesti mencipta makanan yang sempurna. 00:16 - [Keith] Ini adalah "Cuba Guys Mystery Box Challenge" 00:18 ditaja oleh Kroger. 00:21 - Oh, kami mempunyai kotak misteri yang sebenarnya. 00:24 Ada yang membuat pelekat ini? 00:25 Wah, kami benar-benar rasmi hari ini. 00:27 Terima kasih, Kroger. 00:29 Biasanya saya hanya akan menulis perkara ini di Sharpie. 00:31 (muzik optimis) 00:38 Cabaran kotak misteri terakhir 00:39 anda melihat kami memilih bahan untuk rakan kongsi kami 00:41 untuk membuat hidangan dari, 00:42 dan kali ini kita akan melakukannya untuk satu sama lain. 00:45 - [Keith] Tetapi kadang-kadang anda hanya mendapat banyak 00:46 barang pelik yang tersisa dari perjalanan runcit terakhir anda. 00:48 Baiklah, kita akan mengulanginya hari ini. 00:50 Tetapi kita akan menonjolkan beberapa 00:52 ramuan segar musim ini 00:53 kerana Kroger selalu menonjolkan apa yang segar, 00:55 apa yang bermusim. 00:56 - [Ned] Saya secara peribadi menyukai kedai Kroger. 00:57 Kerana dengan mengetengahkan ramuan segar musim ini, 01:01 memudahkan saya merancang makanan 01:03 sekitar apa yang segar dan apa yang berlaku. 01:05 - [Zach] Tetapi setiap kali saya memasak 01:06 pada dasarnya ini adalah beg sampah kotak misteri. 01:08 Anda tidak tahu apa yang anda akan dapat. 01:09 - [Keith] Hari ini kita akan dinilai antara satu sama lain 01:12 serta penduduk Baby Food, Alexandria, 01:15 dan pengeluar kami, Nick, yang juga pengkritik makanan. 01:18 - [Zach] Kami mempunyai satu jam untuk membuat makanan 01:20 dengan bahan-bahan ini sebagai bintang pertunjukan. 01:23 - [Eugene] Dan kami tidak mempunyai resipi. 01:24 Kami tidak dibenarkan melihat resipi. 01:25 Ini hanya kita melakukan yang terbaik, 01:27 yang paling teruk. 01:29 - Saya mempunyai beberapa ketakutan. 01:32 Saya tidak akan berbohong. 01:33 (Keith ketawa) 01:34 - Kita dah sampai. 01:36 - Ia adalah hari kotak misteri. 01:37 Ned, saya ada kotak misteri untuk anda. 01:39 - Dan saya mempunyai kotak misteri untuk anda, tuan. 01:41 - Kita akan ... 01:42 - Hanya ... (berdeham) 01:43 Saya tahu Keith suka ayam goreng. 01:46 Jadi apa sahaja yang dia berikan kepada saya, 01:47 Saya akan mencuba dan membuat ayam goreng. 01:49 Kita akan melihat bagaimana keadaannya. 01:50 - Halo, tuan yang baik? 01:51 - Hello, wanita baik. 01:53 Lihat, Zach dan saya tidak cenderung cenderung 01:57 seperti lelaki lain. 01:58 Oleh itu, kami benar-benar berada di sini untuk percubaan dan keseronokan. 02:02 - Letakkan 60 minit pada jam. 02:06 Dan kemudian anda mahu mengira dengan saya? 02:07 - Baiklah. (bersihkan tekak) 02:08 - [Keduanya] Lima, empat, tiga, dua, satu. 02:12 Yeah. 02:13 - Alonzee. 02:14 - Alonzee. 02:16 - Mari kita teruskan. 02:17 - Jom pergi kerja. 02:18 - Kita mesti pergi. 02:19 - [Keith] Ini masih tidak bermanfaat. 02:20 - Pergi pergi pergi. 02:21 Baiklah. 02:22 - [Keith] Saya gembira dapat membuat kotak misteri untuk Ned. 02:24 Saya ada beberapa perkara yang saya pilih 02:26 yang saya rasa akan mencabar, tetapi mungkin. 02:29 - Baiklah, jadi kita ada sebiji anggur merah, 02:31 kami mendapat sebiji lemon, 02:32 ketumbar, lobak, rutabaga, kembang kol, sauerkraut, 02:37 dan terakhir, tenderloin babi. 02:39 - [Ned] Saya suka idea itu 02:41 dari daging babi yang dibungkus ayam goreng. 02:45 Ya, kita akan menggorengnya. 02:47 Dan kemudian saya akan membuat pengisian lobak, rutabaga, 02:52 Dijon mustard, butter, sauerkraut, mungkin badam. 02:56 Biasanya, saya suka sedikit kekenyangan. 02:59 - (menghela nafas) (ketawa) Saya tidak tahu apa yang harus dilakukan. 03:03 - Saya tidak mempunyai rancangan jadi saya harap ia ada. 03:06 Inilah yang saya dapat untuk Keith hari ini. 03:07 Bit, pasli, kangkung, wortel, ubi ungu, pir, 03:11 dan kemudian gnocchi dan flank steak. 03:14 - [Keith] Jadi saya tahu bahawa saya akan mengasinkan daging ini 03:15 dalam beberapa bawang putih, sebilangan cuka anggur merah, sebilangan rempah. 03:17 Dan saya akan cuba mendapatkan pasli dan pir 03:19 dan bit ke dalam pengasam itu. 03:21 Saya mesti buat seperti kentang yang berfungsi di pasta. 03:24 Kerana saya tidak dapat memberi mereka kentang tumbuk 03:26 dan sebilangan pasta. 03:28 Itulah kegilaan. 03:29 Pasta tumbuk, ada yang? 03:31 Pasta tumbuk. 03:33 - Saya mengambil minyak kelapa, jika anda memerlukannya. 03:35 - [Eugene] Tidak, saya bukan lelaki minyak kelapa besar. 03:39 Apa minyak kegemaran anda yang paling sedikit sehingga saya boleh memasukkannya? 03:41 (Zach ketawa) 03:42 - [Zach] Jadi untuk Eugene, asparagus dan potongan ayam, 03:45 kubis, kapur, kunyit, badam, sos tomato. 03:48 Dia mesti menggabungkan semua ini dalam tortilla, entah bagaimana. 03:53 - [Eugene] Saya tidak tahu apa yang akan saya lakukan. 03:54 Saya hanya akan sayapnya. 03:56 Satu perkara yang saya tidak mahu lakukan adalah membuat burrito. 03:58 Jadi apa yang akan saya mulakan adalah 04:00 Saya akan mula memasak 04:01 dan menyiapkan sesuatu secara individu. 04:02 Dan seperti teka-teki, 04:04 Saya akan mula melekatkannya bersama 04:05 dan lihat apa yang berlaku. 04:06 - (menggerutu) Lihatlah telur dinosaur ini. 04:08 - Apa yang sebenarnya ingin saya pilih adalah kotak, apa lagi?
All the guys have learned so much!
They should do mystery boxes made by children
Eugene's face when he was scraping the tomatoes into the bowl 😂
The way Zach cut the mango hurt me.
i swear nick has done every job
the energy in this video is literally out of this world LOL there are so many GOOD SCENES my god top tier
all the dishes looked soooo good
"But did it bring down south?"
i'm not surprised just most of you forgot the goal was to make meal from box. Keith only added seasoning used boxed and made complete meal. but you all created  yummy dishes. just not a meal and went outside box to much. be proud none of you did bad.
I would definitely like to try keith i-i-mean keith's d-d-d-dish (thirst comment as requested/demanded by keith habersberger)
chopped
"This is grown on Earth?!" Favorite moment of the video.
I feel like the next book should be a cook book which includes all the dishes from the cooking episodes (not just the winners but all the edible, good ones)
I love the end when they all say “but did it ..” and why they should of won 😂 oh zack
“We can say that now because we’re Food Network stars.” TOTALLY GLOSSED OVER?!?!?!?!
i miss the days where they were all bad at cooking
Maybe let’s not support the supermarket chain that has been firing its employees instead of paying them hazard pay!
I feel like this sponsorship was a bit awkward and not as smooth as their regular content, from the tone to the colours, to the commentary, it all just feels a bit toned down, and in a bad way
I both like and fear Eugene saying he's here for experimentation.
For some weird reason Ned smashing with the cast iron skillet gave me so much anxiety 😂
Eugene, “chaos will rain!!” Me, “Asian of chaos!”
Eugene: "I would be a mom who gave up" lololol  Also, this seems like an episode of chopped haha.
Eugene looks so hot
They should do a ‘how many things can fit in Keith’s mouth’ but make it ‘can Zach break open this fruit’ 😆
Sizzle me daddy
When are they going to come out with a cookbook!
i really like how this video was filmed and edited its such high quality, good job 2nd try!!
Chakka like if u are a malayali
so basically nick IS the main character huh?
Me: Asian voluntarily watching Zach butcher some of her favorite foods. Also me: WHY?! What did they ever do to you?!
Keith at the end about grapes🤣
Zackfruit
As a 13 year old who likes to cook these guy are CLUELESS LOL
favorite outro EVER!!
Zach is bad at EVERYTHING
Anybody knows that jazzy background music starts @6:37 ??
I died a little inside when zach opened the mango that way
Can we do something besides food? It's getting redundant
18:53
Really confused that they called Gnocchi. ... isn't this Conchiglioni??? Gnocchi isn't a pasta or noodle. It's a potato dumpling. I'm. So. Confused.
"You had no plan, you blindly executed... and it's good?" That's my entire life philosophy.
Keith did so good!!
i feel like ron swanson would like ned's dish
eugene+facial hair= Asian movie protagonist
All Looked so good!!!!
i'm actually shocked that all their dishes turned out great, they're seriously turning into master chefs through these challenges 😂
Til Americans call swedes rutabagas.
5:30 YESI know the feel . Working the grill at wendy's your hands are constantly either covered in hamburger meat/blood or you are washing them lol. they get SO dry. too.
Asians know that when you put jackfruit inside the fridge, everything just becomes jackfruit.🤣
Is it only in america that gnnochi are not potato based????
I don't know why, but it made me really happy to see the langka (Jackfruit).
Zacks would have been better if it was served on a crunchy tortilla
Opening a mango???
Kinda missed the try guys colours
I really enjoy the cooking videos, you guys are awesome! I love how supportive you are of each other. I was surprised how far along your cooking skills have become.  For a suggestion it would be fun to see your partners judge. I love when the whole try guy’s family is in a video. Your partners are a wonderful addition and are beautiful and funny.  Don’t hate but my favorite podcast is You Can Sit With Us.
I stopped watching when Zach did that to that mango.
Ned's dish reminds me of Hannibal's clay roasted thigh
I was so surprised when Eugene didn't use alcohol
OOOOF Rhett and Link have been trying to get that Kroger sponsorship for like 10 years
Didn't Krogers shut down a bunch of stores in LA because they didn't want to pay their essential workers more money because of an ordinance?
I would want to eat Keith's dish the most!
I am just glad Zach didn't poison anyone. Also, Ned should have won. :)
Zach with the Jack fruit reminded me of Eugene's mom calling him "Jack"
Gordon Ramsey would either want to stab them or would love their enthusiasm
Nah bulls**t Ned should have been last. He went over time and half his dish wasn't in the box.
I wanna try all of these!
Can we talk about how good zachs hair looks right now 😂😂😂
Zach using metal forks in a nonstick pan had me cringing!
whose going to tell keith that gnocchi is made from potatoes
IM HERE FOR THE BEARDS
Omg the last clip of Keith with the grapes🤣🤣🤣
Can we talk about the sink?
hi
the fact that they did so much better with completely random ingredients than with anything on without a recipe is mind-boggling to me.
ILL TAKE A TORTILLA... AND FRY IT!
Eugene!  Frying flour tortillas makes buñuelos (you can add powdered sugar)  Frying corn tortilla makes tortilla chips
They should have cast Eugene in Hannibal. He gorgeous and wicked and great with food and drinks
Omg Zach- “there’s knives on the floor everybody be careful”  Eugene- “who put knives on the floor?  Zach- “I DONT HAVE TIME”
Does Keith know that gnocchis are made out of potatoes? 😂
"This is beautiful.  This is grown on earth?!" 💖
As an Indian, Zach handling mangoes, coconut and the jackfruit PAINED me.
Tip: The coconut oil is to remove the sticky sap after cutting the jackfruit. So you don't really have to smear oil on your knife. Just cut it normally and if any of the sap gets on your hand, just use coconut oil to remove it.
SIZZLE ME DADDY
Please keep doing these!!!!
The one time Eugene doesn't cook with alcohol he turns into a GD genius lol
Eugene with Mollymauk energy "Chaos will reign"  Still shook from most recent episode (April 16 2020)
Keith!!!
I need to go to therapy after seeing Zach open that mango 💀
I am a huge texture person; I would have chosen Ned
What are rutabagas? It looks like a turnip?
Keith saying a frying pan is a weapon immediately made me think of Tangled.
kids lunch idea 4 moms: The taco nachos eugene made can be made upside down as casseroles with a crispy lettered tortilla on top; the letter being the first in each childs name.
New try guy video Kieth and Eugene try to learn from an expert how to make improvised weapons. Zach and Ned learn from an expert how to make improvised barriers to protect themselves from Kieth and Eugene.
Almost had to spit out my tea with: Eugene is the mom that gave up... 🤣🤣🤣
“this is a our planet vegetable”
The little sound effect they use in this video puts my teeth on edge 😬
These are my favourite kind of videos
Eugene “I would make a great killer!”  Me “... You think?!”
I just realized Ned Fulmer sounds like a combination of Ned Flanders and Homer.
somebody be watching Dr.Who
I thought Eugene was gonna say him and Zach and him were only there for vibes
10:12 “I’d make a great killer”  okay... wtf lol
zach opening that mango made me shudder
im from ga and I'm genuinely so confused how kroger got to them
I'm surprised Ned didn't win! His dish looked amazing! It looked really tasty and it was creative!
10:15 giving me very much Sweeney Todd energy
They actually pulled this off!! Now do another round with desert ingredients and let's see how well they do. Probably look a lot more like without a recipe. 🤣😭
EUGENE more astrology
Shout out to Devlin - the editing on this was phenomenal!
Nacho Zach 😂 ...in hindi it actually means ! "DANCE " Zack 😂
I cried how zack open the mango huhu
Great new show!
love this. but what kind of German remoulade is that supposed to be? :D Just because of the sauerkraut? :D:D love from Germany
No Keith I’m definitely in the same boat of washing my hands constantly when touching raw meat. Even just cracking an egg.
this was their most impressive cooking video
obsessed with the outro, thank you keith ily
eugene with a beard is so wild
really loving eugene’s beard
EUGENE KNOWS HOW TO BE 4TH?????🤯
Eugene: “so go really cut yourself and I’ll kiss it” Zack: “okayyy” *walks off with knife* 😂😭✋🏻
Zach is so my favorite
Ya'll should do this again except rather than having two people swapping boxes it should loop. Then when you get to the tasting portion it will actually be surprising to see how the dish turned out using the ingredients you chose since you didn't watch them cook it the whole time
kumquats?
Why is Keith such a DILF like come on
I like how kroger is the sponsor. Considering the fact that kroger pulled a dick move and demanded their employees pay back the hazard they were given during the pandemic.
When Keith gets happy he sounds like Glenn from Superstore
I miss jackfruit.
Keith is so fucking hot fixing his glasses. He’s so hot and kind. Becky cherish him or we’re coming
I haven’t seen a try guys video in a while but wowwww eugene looks so good with a beard
I'd love to be able to make weird food from produce bought from Kroger, but HEB ran them out of town nearly 30 years ago. We also lost Albertson's in 2002. All supermarkets are HEB now.
"sizzle me daddy!" can that be a tshirt?
Kroger is mistreating their employees and stretching them thin as much as possible despite record breaking profits. They are absolute scum and you should be better than this.
Can u guys pls do another pickling video?
Ugh! Eugene! DO NOT SHAVE! Eeeveerrr! It looks so damn good!
We need a without a recipe with edibles  🍃
They should try butchering.
So we're just going to ignore Zach shredding jackfruit with forks in a nonstick skillet, huh
can we see these guys on chopped food network
you should do a book about cooking with these recipes and sell it
I love Ned hyping up the beard. He’s a beard guy, he gets it.
How did the humble staple of British cuisine, the swede, come to be known as a Rutabaga?
a cooking episode where they all did decently well?? wowie
Why is nobody talking about the fact that young Keith used to spit grapes onto his pet cats
Ned annoys me
Kroger ads make me cringe so hard. My mom boogies tho
“I’d make a GREAT killer...” - Eugene Lee Yang
is zach wearing rick owens in this? or i’m giving him way too much credit?
Gnocchi is made out of potatoes or even potato starch soooo pastatoes is not that far from the same exact thing
Who else was waiting for A to be for Ankles 😂
I love their cooking videos!!!
Wow Eugene actually didnt use alcohol.....huh
Facial hair Eugene is HOT
Lol pretty sure Eugene is fairly zooted through this whole episode
Kroger? The same owners of Fred Meyer? The ones that recently had so much food waste they got police to physically guard it from people trying to document the amount?? Under the guise of preventing homeless people from dumpster diving? The massive food waste during a pandemic and ice storm?? Great sponsorship
I would LOVE to see the try wives do one episode of without a recipe !
Zach at the end...did he bring it down south🤣
this is the first time they all made something edible lmao
Zach and eugene's boo-boo moment is the cutest 😭
11:25-11:35 favorite part of video
Cruse god flam it!!!
Alex was so amazing in this!! we need more judgy alex and less of keith trying to force food on her an yb!!!!
omg! such a good pun
Is the food cold????
meh paid promotion, of course they will like everything.....
Food does not slap; it smacks.
Eugene is a culinary wizard. There's no other explanation
Does anyone else get the feeling Eugene doesn't really like Zach?
I hate that sharp knife noise! You are torturing my ears
I wanna see these guys join masterchef to see if their dishes will actually work
Ned made meat sushi 😍
zach: im gonna kill myself. im gonna kill myself me: same
can we just take a sec... to appreciate... how this is the first time... EVERYONE's dish was GOOD.... wow im speechless
i had to pause for how the mango was murdered. RIP Mango
If anyone says they don't have Eugene fantasy's they are LIARS!!! So dreamy and suave
please make this a series
Lunch is like $20 everywhere in California 🥲
people in new zealand be like ... whats a sweet potato thats kumara
Hmm. Keiths logic is sound. If you have a cast iron skillet in your house you probably do have a weapon, generally every kitchen that has one of those also has at least 1 knife.
I think Ned made meat sushi
Omg try guys cookbook!!!!!!!
I LOVE KEITHS LAUGH
They’ve come such a long way in the kitchen. I’m so proud 🥲
Eugene's beard is a masterpiece itself
then judging each other and being so proud of each other is so wholesome!! love it
9:55 secret reference to Tangled😃
I tired the website but couldn’t find a place. Where do we send fam mail or requests or is it just literally the comments section?
Go bass fishing against a professional bass fisherman.   Mike (the ike) ikanely
Crying at the fact that Ned literally said "Oh Noooooooooooooooooo" like a dad playing with his children when the meat fell off his platter XD
Imagine if they made a cookbook with professional versions of all the recipes they've improvised, even the failed ones
Omg, good job Zach! Finally he made something edible lol
I wasnt ready for Eugene allons-y !
Who wants to see Keith try to eat healthy for one week
If you're adding veggies to a marinade always blend them. I.e. a garlic paste will absorb into a chicken better than chopped/minced garlic because the ingredient is so blended it gets soaked into the pores of the meat.  It's almost if you added butter to cold pancakes and expected the pancakes to soak up the cold slab. The butter has to be in liquid form for the pancakes to absorb it
11:16 LOL!
10:06-10:20 I'm terrified 😂
Sizzle me daddy LMAO
I didn't know kroger could make nice boxes(I work there)
This was so great, and those all looked SO GOOD!
Are...are the Tru Guys actually getting legitimately good at cooking?
They have a contract with food network?!
Time for thirsty Keith comments😆
After all these years Ned still think he is Italian
Is anyone going to point out Ned saying that the food "slaps" or no 🤧
Ok that end credits scene fucking sniped me from a neighboring building oh my god! I'm crying real tears
so, this had to be super perfect, everyone does great, little goes wrong, like this is because of the sponsor.....right?
I really like this type of videos from try guys
I am so glad that Zach is marrying a nurse because he worries me when he uses kitchen utensils.
The amount of murder references in this video is unreal
Why is.keith giving me hot chef vibes
Try Guys NEED to play Cards Against Humanity against each other.
Is it just me or do all the Try Guys look more attractive in this video.
Loved this episode!! All the guys looked really attractive here except for Ned. He needs to step up his dressing game.
Eugene!!!!!!!
Why is the gay one the only who seems straight, the other 3 are fucking FA-LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMING!
my besties on trending so true
Lol wait is $16 for a meal that includes steak expensive in the states? 😭
I love how Kroger can pay you guys but will shut down their stores when there front line workers ask for better pay.
Eugene's one liners are GOLD. *sliding red tomatoes off the board and making eye contact* "I would make a great killer."
i love the title "resident food baby"
This shocked me- like *shocked* me
Beard
I saw jackfruit and coconut, ginataang langka
Keep challenging them like this and they WILL learn how to actually cook! They'll be too powerful! Impossible to challenge!!
The try guys should make a cook book 🤔
Zach can go to hell
i actually want to have the recipes and try these out
sorry but ned should have been 4th place: chicken wasn’t included and his meal took more than 1 hour to be ready
Zach's right, that Eugene pun was fun 👏🏼
whos gunna tell keith gnocchi is potatoes
These 4 need to compete on the actual Chopped now that they're Food Network talent!
I like how in both mystery boxes Zach has made a sandwich lol
Eugene is a genius, let’s admit cause that looked good
Keith's voice when he started peeling the purple potato...
Eugene has the hotness level of the Duke from Bridgerton with this new haircut
I'm still very disturbed by the way Zach opened that mango
Zach's box was made by a south Asian aunty.
Nick has such a beautiful voice, he could describe brutally torturing someone and it would be soothing. Welcome to my Ted Talk
How did a cooking show turn into a murder show
idk why but Ned always remind me of Mitch from Modern Family
There's an actual Filipino dish which uses coconut milk + jackfruit 😂
Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.
10:12 Sitting here thinking Eugene could do an ASMR cooking show, until he says "I'd make a great killer." Wtf, Eugene.
wait but how come they all did well
Zach can dissect the jackfruit perfectly, but failed to deal with mango
This whole video is basically my method of cooking, lol.
You guys need to do an episode where you replace the staff with children that look the same and have a similar personality!😂
Go sky diving!!! Go cliff jumping!!! Go mountain biking!!!
This makes me so hungry!😋
Oh Keith, the things we’d do if you weren’t married.... 😏
I adored the pun, “Nacho Zack”
The meat sweats
Allons-y!
NED AND KEITH WERE GREAT
ALL THESE DISHES WERE AMAZING
Zach Is Like my brother in the kitchen. But Better 😂. My Brother make's way many mess than Zach
"sizzle me daddy" is scary and concerning, Zack has some explaining
NOT ZACK USING TWO FORKS IN A NON STICK PAN NOOOOOOO
Bolivian Aji de fideo has both potatoes and pasta! Would have been a win!
Wolfgang Ned😂😂
Why's Alex so soft-spoking in this episode?
The beard is working. It is working SO WELL, EUGENE.
Jackfruit is very versatile. Can eat the flesh & seed. Roasted or baked seed is a favourite snack of mine. It’s really fun to watch every episode of them trying too cooking something decent without having a kitchen disaster 🤣
Really love the graphics and editing in this.
Beard Eugene hits different
Ned:  And of course, it's carved table-side.  [saws with chef's knife]
hey guys! video idea: the try guys try rug making
I agree with Keith, when recipes say one clove of garlic it means more lol
Eugene’s beard is amazing. Keith spitting at cats is amazing.
I love how they are supporting each other
Keith's hair is very shiny and healthy and a very nice feathered texture hairstyle.
Happy Ramadhan for those watching Remember: Your not alone watching food videos while fasting
it is my great dream to try ned's cooking
I honestly feel 1 hr is so less :( and if they cant really finish it on time its basically wastage of resources used haha!!
I was not expecting the ranking!!!!
Does Eugene ever get any thing wrong!?!?!?
This is grown on earth, this is an our planet vegetable? -keith's auditioning to play an alien trying to blend into earth culture
I’m very impressed by the dishes.
This video is top 👌
Not Zack not knowing how to open a mango...
Why do they look like dads without kids?
So punny, Eugene. ^_^
My stress levels soared when they bit into the jackfruit seeds. They're supposed to peel it whether it's roasted or boiled (which makes it creamy) 😭
A tablespoon of salt: exists Alexandria: ...hmmm needs more salt
Keith is my favorite lol
Every Asian person knows exactly what Eugene's going through rn
I really want to see these guys on Chopped.
I like Eugene with facial hair.
Frying pans! Who knew?!
Now the Try Guys need to write a cookbook.
I guess y’all aren’t allowed to call it chopped lol
They have a contract with the FOOD NETWORK?!
wate you do not know how to peal a mango he said break into it but you can peal it or break into it ether way works
I feel like if Zach had toasted his bread, that would have given him the win!
Keith was looks really nice in that shirt!
I would be so mad if Keith didn't win. That was so creative and beautiful!!!
Lmfao all the comments the try guys make in this video 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I'm dying
Honestly, thank you Zach for actually "reacting" to the judgment. Not because he didn't deserve 3rd place but because the video was just too positive for a Try Guys cooking show!
It is so fun to see the kitchen looking set then look at  the side of the screen and see all the messy bricks
This was definitely a pilot for the Food Network.
Eugene announced as last place everybody gasping and Keith “Omg how could this happen?” Was the best quote of this entire thing
I work for Kroger and hoo boy “all about freshness” got me 😂
Zach there was such a better way to handle that coconut you poor baby
Does Keith know that gnocchi is potatoes ???
You guys should do another without a recipe season
I enjoyed that pun
Eugene saying he’d make a great killer is the most Capricorn of energies 😂
I want to try Ned’s dish so baddddd 😭😂
This was a lot of fun to watch!
The jackfruit wasn't ripe enough.
Get outside judges not your terrified employees
I loved that pun
I need a high cooking video so the mystery ingredients are only good togther high and you have to try them sober too?? Maybe lol idk
zach really decided white bread was the way to go lmao
I’d love to see the guys get a makeover to be goth or some other alternative styles. Japanese street fashion Harajuku, Cyber punk, and steam punk maybe?
Love Eugene's facial hair
So Eugene made chicken tostadas
Zach Kornfeld, Korndiddy of the Great Grass Sea!
"Nachos Zach"
Okay but can we get a try guys nailed it episode???
Dear Ned,  Please don't ever say something slaps again. Also, food doesn't 'slap', music does. Food can 'smack' though.  Thank you!  Sincerely,  Someone whose actually from the bay area.
Keith is looking incredibly handsome in this video...🥰
a small note for Ned: schmacks is for food, slaps is for songs
Loved the pun
zach really missed an opportunity not calling his sandwich a Sloppy Jack
I love that pun!
“Did it bring it to down south?” 😂
Keith admiring the Ube was one of the purest things I've seen in the past few days.
Anyone see Ned smashing the meat and remember Zach and Ashley's buzzfeed married video? "Pounding meat for our wives, we are pounding meat for our wives" :)
so painful to watch Zach rip the mango open like that lol
I would have just stood there and scratch my head, not knowing what to do
I love that they all did so good
I've always wondered where do they film their cooking videos?🤔
WTH do Americans call Gnocchi? That isn’t gnocchi- gnocchi is a pasta and potato blend made into a large almost bean shaped round - what they have on that plate is a conchiglioni - shell shaped pasta!
edit fail when the judges tasted neds cocktail!!. one shot the plates are empty and the other shot there's eaten food on the plates lool.
The should make a cook book called “The Try Guys Cook book” and put all the recipes even the bad ones in the book and sell it
I love it when Eugene and Zach are paired together. Such serene chaos lol
Do the same challenge but with the try wife's / husband's
I love Eugene's beared so mutch , he looks like the fun uncle and thats amazing
Why is no one taking about how Zack opened up a Mango with his hands 🤯
Lol I’m like screaming at the screen “Ned make roasted radish and rutabagas they taste like potatoes!!!”
I’m always so happy when Keith wins! He puts his heart into his cooking and he always has a well laid out plan.
I LOVE EUGENES BEARD SITUATION
Love the Nacho Zack pun! Chef's kiss!
Keith talking about the cast iron skillet weapon had me DYING for some reason 🤣🤣🤣
As a person who suffers from lactose intolerance, I'm here for that quick pass of lactaid to the judges.
Eugine could simply make chilaquiles with his ingredients
i loved that pun
so are we just going to ignore when Eugene aggresively kissed Ned on TikTok
Looking at the purple yams and thinking “that’s a kumara, bruh”
Not only do you not know how to fire a gun without a negligent discharge , but you can't cook. Congrats. What skills DO you have
zach prying that mango open like an animal made me violent
@14:56 was looking forward to YB as the judge...
i think kroger did the impossible. they managed to get all four of them to make actually edible and delicious food. wow.
I want to see without a recipe or mystery box with 100% vegetarian or vegan items!
It's like bad chopped
Zach had jackfruit when he gave Maggie cans in her mystery box and she made jackfruit tacos!
N: Keith? K: Yes? N: It's time to beat the meat K: No
29:59 ned just stares into your soul for SO LONG
make this a regular thing!!
Damn Eugene is fine.
Please do a vegan version, pleasee!!!
It’s a sloppy jack (jackfruit) made by Zach!
*zach commenting on how good Eugene's wizard skills Eugene: also, big letters What a cutie
this is my favorite series :)
Keith always makes my day. His energy just makes me feel better when I’m having a bad day
The mammoth jacket consistently help because bull baly coil afore a chunky sail. cut, nappy mosque
As an Asian, if you ever wanted to torture me, just play the clip of zach handling the fruits over and over again
The fearful fearless south africa nouzilly bury because cornet osmotically soak for a capricious john. hulking, brainy south korea
Ok so is nobody going to tell them that gnocchi are literally made of potatoes or
Chopped is quaking
Struggled a little on this video to hide the fact that this was a 30min ad.
I’m going into high school and have been doing a lot of looking in to what to expect and how to keep up good grades for college, Ned should make a video about how he got into Yale.
Eugene love the beard!!
30:04 was so random lol Keith cracks me up. and the ending was so funny too
Man, if Nick wasn’t gay...
Zach really missed the opportunity to call his sandwich a “sloppy jack”
25:08 why carry that whole pork loin and risking a drop when you can move the board closer to you?
But. That's not actually gnochi. Gnochi is not that. Je suis confused.
*spoiler alert* Eugene losing nearly made me turn off the whole thing, Eugene should never lose.
I love that pun
NO NO NO ZACCCCC DID NOT JUST DO THAT WITH THE MANGO! THAT IS NOT HOW YOU "OPEN" A MANGOOO
DO THIS MORE PLEASE its so chill
I love how everyone was so offended by no thirsty Keith comments, that now there is an outpour of them under every video 🤣
I love that Zach is yelling about how he lose and Eugene goes “this isn’t without a recipe” 😂😂😂
“I’d make a great killer 😊.” .....every Capricorn ever.
YOO KEITH IS SO ATTRACTIVE IN THIS EPISODE WTFF
The uttermost holiday coincidentally time because shop architecturally race of a hard barbara. adorable, married punishment
I love keith wtf
Is eugene still gay or nah? ,his beard confused me
Doctor Who? 2:13
I love how nice everyone is during the judging process. It's very refreshing.
I think instead of making a sandwich zach could have made toasted garlic bread
I love curry of jackfruit with buff meat tasty
Jackfruit and coconut? Bro, you can't make gudeg in an hour only 😂😂
Kroger BBQ.... doesnt slap.
Zach your hair looks amazing!
I WOULD EAT ALL OF THAT.
Can someone please give link of previous mystery box challenge mentioned at 0:43
Zack did a real good job with the Asian ingredients. And yes you are supposed to apply oil onto your hands and knife when cutting into jackfruit otherwise you’ll be in a GREAT STICKY MESS FOR DAYS
I love watching the try guys cooking videos, they make it so entertaining and its like we go through with them in their cooking journey to learn to become better cooks.
ZACH SMILING AND LAUGHING AT 1:55-1:58 JUST MAKES ME SO HAPPY.
29:48 - Did anyone think that Zach’s joke tickled Keith possibly a bit too much??? 😂
Omg they should make a cook book if they haven't yet!!
The way zach cut that mango is murdering me
i don't know why this annoy me so much but these are not gnocchi
zach's cooking evolution though
NACHOS ZACH! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I may recreate and veganise eugene's dish! It looks great!
I love Keith as a judge Lol
If something works it works. This doesn't work. But hey with youtube itself backing you look! You guys have it...
Idea: Gordon Ramsey tasting try guys mystery box
Zach opening that mango gave me a heart attack
The complete lack of negative feedback during the judging makes me think that in order for Kroger to sponsor they had the condition of no negative talk about the food.
My jaw dropped when Eugene got 4th place! Has he ever gotten 4th place??
Unrelated :  Did Zack ever do a hair procedure  update ?
10:18 Maybe Eugene's been watching Hannibal.  Yay for Keith! Absolutely amazed these dishes were not only edible but tasty even.
I loved the pun it was punny thumbs up from me
Eugene is me in the kitchen. No plan, just ingredients, somehow it works.
it's wild that people think pasta and potatoes can't go together. we literally eat pasta with potatoes in italy. you can do it guys, don't be shy.
Is this the only cooking episode where Eugene didn't use alcohol? 😅
Love how Ned incorporated chicken into his dish even though it wasn't in his mystery box
Okay , Zach breaking the coconut by throwing it onto the ground brought out 2 sides of me: 1. Who wanted to laugh at his stupid cleverness 2. The inner Asian in me whose triggered by it lol 😭
Ned’s food is like food wars lol
I just thought of something the Try Guys should do. They should do something similar to blue apron. Meaning each of them get a box with specific measured ingredients. And those are the only things they can use. And it makes a specific dish but they have no idea what the dish is. And they can film it by having it jumps scenes between them and  someone making the dish correctly with the instructions.
Ohh myy god that mango.... why???
Eugene’s energy was a bit different in this video
Now this is Try Guys really trying. Love how they really made an effort. Everything looks good. Nice job guys!
Use a cast iron skillet as one.    Just ask my dad my mom almost took his head off with one as she flung one through the wall
hahaha contract with the food network
TIL limequat existed
Eugene: "This is just us doing what we do best, which is-" Me: "Try!" Eugene: "Being the worst" Me: "oh"
rare beef is the best beef, fully cooked is like eating a piece of rubber.
If you don't want the tortilla to puff like that during frying, use the tip of your knife and stab it a few times. kek (not big slits, you just wants to poke it a little)
Eugene's dish should have been named "Zachos"
Eugene saying 'if it's not bleeding it doesn't get a kiss'...asian parents around the world nodding in approval
ugh the masterchef vibes
Why aren't we talking about Zach having to stand up to cut his food? I'm unbearably amused.
Making Zach open all those difficult things? A*hole move.
As a former Kroger employee they suck. They only gave us two week COVID pay and a store in another state required it still and they just shut the store down
Nick has the most soothing voice.
the only episode where everyone made great and edible dishes and its not a without a recipe lololol
Eugene's dish kind of looks like a frybread taco
🤯 eating gnocchi while watching this
y’all must got that good kroger cause ours smells like rottten milk 🤢
wait how did eugene get hotter
I ALWAYS want y'all to write out these recipes so we can get a taste of them at home, because somehow these wild rides almost always look delicious
Ned missed the opportunity to make vegan fried chicken using cauliflower!
The Try Guys clearly need to collaborate with SORTEDfood.
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE your beard, Eugene!!
This is how you make an ad
Petition to end every video with "we're the try guys we love you" cause that made me really happy, and like actually feel loved.
For some odd reason the sounds at 10:10 gave me major Dumbo flashbacks...
I didn't know jackfruits were so big omfg
Eugene watching Zach throughout the whole episode: bless his little white heart
The best outro 😂
Eugene seemed genuinely hurt and upset when he got fourth. 😢
That was honestly the funniest outro
You deserve it :)
I love these guys but man, Eugene is just on another level
I think if zack used rice that would be more like Asian meal
day 3 asking the try guys to do a reading fanfiction part 2
i wanna see a try guys baking video where the judges have to guess who made it
LOVE THIS! Its definitely like CHOPPED or any other Food Network tv shows! Impressed with their cooking combinations :)))
Ned is such an overachiever. Like wtf that was spectacular.
how much acid did keith put in there man
I lost it when Zach said “Sizzle me daddy”’ LMAO
I'm too picky for a competition like this. But have to give it to them for all being good
Is this the first time Eugene has ever lost? He was shocked. :)
The little journey Ned went on to take the pork tenderloin to the cutting board made me laugh a little too hard 😂😂
Okay but now have Gordon Ramsey guest star and  yell at you and judge your dishes 😂😂😂
A+++  to whoever made these graphics.
Yes  Eugene might not have won but the beard 😍
zach not being able to cut open a mango made my day  ..I'm taking all the food ideas from here they look amazing
I like the facial hair
i never try roasted jackfruit seeds, but boiled jackfruit seeds are goooood!
me in ohio: .... westerners have krogers?
The way Zach..... did whatever he was trying to do with the mango and smacking the coconut on the ground to get it open just irked me 😭😂
So, this is a Kroger ad . . . :-/
I still imagine Gordon Ramsay being a judge someday for the Try Guys
No one cheered with Nick :<<<< 17:27
Eugene is embarrassed for Zach's attempt at a Southern accent. As a fellow Texan, so am I.
People who don't know how to open or cut fruit surprise me
zach trying to OPEN A MANGO.... lmao
Eugene is aging so well, he gets more and more handsome.
I would literally pay for:  - Zach to make me love the movie Cats - Ned to teach me chemistry though I’m not gonna remember any of it  - Keith to tell me what foods to eat and what not to eat from restaurants I’ve never heard of  - And Eugene to kill me
Keith looks like grant from college humor
There Eugene goes again constantly raising the bar, and doing it flawlessly✨
How else can tell how high Zach is in this video 😂
no one: keith: “i’m adding vinegar to that too”
This is such a departure from without a recipe with all of the guys getting complements on there dishes.
Jackfruits are intimidating? How about durian? Everything about durian screams "don't touch!"
Please do this again
Can we ask for Neds instructions with his dish? It really looks appetizing.
Zack massacred that poor mango!
You peel the jackfruit seed and then eat it
Is this the new office???
The editing in this is amazing!!
Please don't call something "German" just bc you put Sauerkraut in it 😅
My god Alexandria is just absolutely stunning
i'm khaleesi, mother of dragons, and this is my baby - Zach 2021
10:12 that transition was SO smooth. It legit made me cackle
I love these men. 🥰
Jackfruit... my one allergy 😅
"If you're bleeding that means you're actually in pain" -Eugene "Tiger Mom" Lee Yang
wasn't that always Zach's problem, adding too many things and ruining it after it was fine? So maybe someone limiting his ingredients is a good thing (Technically it's not limited, but still)
Keith give us the recipe. That looked soooo beautiful
The Try Guys are selling out.  Kroger? Seriously? Y'all want to be socially aware but are also completely missing the social mark lately with the people you guys are associating with. Kroger sucks and you guys know this... You are in LA. Come on.... TRY harder like you actually care about your local community and socially aware viewers.
Surely this becomes a series!
The Try Guys could publish a cookbook at this point...
Formal request for Ned to share the whole fried chicken recipe. That looked amazing
Petition for the Try guys to be on Nailed it!
28:42 made me choke on ice cream. ICE CREAM. Idk if im crying from pain or from laughter
The try guys must try something related to babies... Like baby products or a quiz about baby situations where ned can be quiz master!
Eugene looks so good 🥰
I am honestly ASTOUNDED that Zach's was tasty! Go him!! The process looked incredibly chaotic
Zach opening that mango sending chills down my spine.
Soo, Can we get a game of The Try Guys playing some Dead by Daylight?
I actually love this video. Everything is 🤌 *chef's kiss*
I think ned should have got 4th since his went over the time limit.
I love the pun
First they all rock.            But Zack please toast the bread.
There's no way they'd be allowed to make anything that bad in a sponsored video.
All the encouragement at the end was a really nice turn of events
"This isn't Without A Recipe, you don't have to fight" is what should have diffused that awkward unfunny 'acted reaction'
Try guys but make it Master Chef
You should try to make Donuts or cupcakes for the next "without a recipe"
I need the try guys to try volleyball!
Keith if you had a good time then it's NOT a waste of time lol
Yikes, Zack saying "South Asian" and "I made a Eugene"  is just peak cringe. This guy is super racist, why do y'all let him say this shit???
Who else was expecting chaos and failure but also happy that they did really well!!
kroger
10:32 anybody else read it as *pasta toes*? No? Just me?
The perfect episode tbh
If zack toasted the bread it would be perfect
Just me loving Eugene’s beard?
eugene staring deadpan with a smile on his face into the camera while saying i'd make a great killer is the highlight of my day
Can someone please explain the nachos zach pun to me like im 5 thank u
I need this to be a series
that jack fruit seed really craeiounch
Matt might be facepalming himself to oblivion watching this....
Zach opening a mango with his HANDS will haunt me forever
"sizzle me daddy"- Zack, 2021
I honestly can't believe this is free content
keith winning made me so happy lmao
oh no, it's midnight and now I'm hungry :<
YOHANAN(JOHN/JUAN) 14:6 "I AM THE WAY AND THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE. NO ONE COMES TO THE FATHER EXCEPT THROUGH ME" "YO SOY EL CAMINO Y LA VERDAD Y LA VIDA. NADIE VIENE AL PADRE SINO POR MI"........
Ned fucking cheated
ned’s whole personality is  - italian  - dad - bread
Keith is looking pretty fine with those hot forearms sitting out there, oh yeeeah
I adore you guys but taking a Kroger sponsorship, especially while being an LA based company that is always encouraging social awareness, is gross
Keep up the hard work! Love your videos!
9:50-10:10 or so. why do you think that was Rapunzel's weapon of choice?? it was in the house
Did the try guys get a different person to edit videos or is it just me?
i audibly gasped when eugene got 4th place
I think Eugene is the most "but how" person in the try guys group when it comes to the cooking videos, because he dosent have a plan he never really thinks to measure things and at the end he almost always wins
Gnocchi are potatoes, tho
Ned's sounds disgusting af
Keith, next time skip the t-shirt we need the chest!
Unfortunately, Kroger shut down stores instead of paying their employees hazard pay during the pandemic. Not a great sponsor at this point.
This video was everything
Great job to all 4 of you!
Eugene looks like the Ghost of Tsushima
How did they all make good food?😂
Drink every time they say word “fresh”
Sounds like they are all winners here!
A twist on the mystery box challenge, can yall just switch kitchens? Lol yall did so good guys
Tbh a cast iron skillet 100% counts as a weapon. Keep in mind though, it is not strong enough to withstand a bullet. It's going straight through that skillet.
This has Chopped vibes from the food network...you guys should try that as sequel to this
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL NED TO STOP SAYING FOOD SLAPS FOOD DOES NOT SLAP FOOD SMACKS USE THE BAY AREA LINGO RIGHT YA GRINDING MY GEARS!!!!!!!!
The guys got sponsored by fucking KROGER! Like wtf.
The way Zach opened that coconut and mango my inner Indian mother came out of me and wanted give him a lecture all what’s wrong with his life. And Eugene ITS TURMIC it makes everything even stuff you never wanted to make yellow, yellow
Yeah, these weren’t gnocchi, they were gnocchi-shaped regular pasta, which is why Keith couldn’t mash them
*IS IT BUSSIN GUYS?*
Eugene in 4th ?!?! FIXED
The Asain of Chaos hath returned😈
That's not gnocchi...??
*Zach-Eugene* chemistry hits differently
WOWWW IM PROUD OF ALL OF THEMMMMM this is like the best vid EVERRRRRRRRR (well every vid of the try guys is the best) but this one is wholesomeeeeeee for me
This is the most important post you’ll ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed ... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 );  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
I love that Eugene brought jackfruit! Its a great food and its actually delicious. And Zach is right about the seeds, you can roast them and they are tasty! The coconut on the other hand, you can open it up by hitting the back of your cleaver or some big knife into it, like you are cracking egg 😂not applicable for young coconut though hahahah) watching you guys cook is therapeutical to be honest ❤
The try guys need to do a video with twosetviolin.
Eugene made Zachoes
im getting minorly triggered  at how zach is opening and using both the coconut and the jackfruit lol
eugene: I'd be a great killer
This is the food network show every 20 something needs. None of us know how to cook (or very few of us do) and we get a bunch of stuff and hope to make a meal
Wait, after prince philip died, doesn't ned kinda look like young prince philip?-
brit here - what is kroger? also when do we get an office tour!!
ZACK USING ZACKFRUIT
Eugene. Zach is already cut.
Did it bring you down south??? 😂😂
I died when Zack said “did it bring down south” hahah
The image of Zach peeling the mango like a madman will forever haunt my dreams
Not gonna lie, Neds Dish looks like it could be served in any german restaurant in the States
I need a fan fiction about zach and Eugene with this episode in mind..... he made a meal for Zach and spelled his name it shows he does care
that’s how you spell sauerkraut wth
Keith giving himself a literal thirst comment ("I'm reallllly thirsty" 25:30).
Estrogen ridden dog shit.
Y’all should work with a chef to release a cookbook with versions of everything you made in your cooking videos!
the way zach opened that mago.... god
In the Philippines, purple yam is called ube and we use it in desserts and make it into jam. It's delicious and sweet when you eat the jam straight out if the jar.
"Sponsored by Kroger 🥰" Me, a Kroger employee: oh God..
Jackfruit is the national fruit of Bangladesh, BTW.
you heard it here first, ladies: if you live alone, sleep with a cast iron skillet on your bed side table for safety.
Kroger needs to pay their employees $5 extra and not close down their stores in low income areas of L.A.
I would love to see the Try Guys on an episode of "Nailed It"
Eugene: I'd make a great killer Me: Immediately likes the video
I love this new episode of Chopped.
As someone who's from the Bahamas, having to watch Zach open a mango made me cringe lol
So they’re cooking? Is this not how normal people cook? With random things you find in your fridge😂😂😂 but also I’m very here for this!
Wait... does no one in this video know that gnocchi is actually potatoes ?
watching zach open those fruits his way hurts my tropical asian ass xD
Finally back to the kitchen!!!!
Imagine the try guys on like, chopped or something.
This sponsorship is funny considering they all always shop at whole foods (I’ve see those 365 Whole Foods brand ingredients)
Now all of these dishes need to be in a Try Guys Cookbook. I'd buy it
All these cooking videos are probably making the Food Network regret ever talking to them
E: "If it isn't bleeding then it doesn't need a kiss" Me:........................*slowly reaches for knife*
💁Try guys cookbook everyone?😂
Would love to see them try to ice skate !
Ned shouldve lost a pile of meat isnt food.
um where’s the try guys cook book
A fun recipe for cooking Kale leaves is to either fry or oven bake the leaves with some oil and seasonings. It tastes delectable and literally melts in the mouth in a blast of flavor. It's also super quick and easy to make.
"I'd make a great killer" Wtf only Eugene would say something like that.
those sure as hell aren’t gnocchi
Nacho zach!
*Google search metrics for "limequat" jump 14500%*
captions pls
"we can say that now, cause we're food network stars" 🤣
I’ve never really watched the try guys. Out of curiosity, are Keith and Ned a couple?
me to my boyfriend: awwww keith said he loved me. and he blew a kiss! my bf: keith better BACK UP
I think this was the most polite food judging we’ve seen on try guys
Zach: bReAd Eugene: Z A C H
Never had cheese on asparagus... you clearly didn’t have a violently Wisconsin dairy loving grandma who always grew way to much asparagus, and you ate it at every meal when you were at the farm.
That was freaking awesome! Everyone was so creative! The judges had the hardest job. Lol it's easy to place the bad ones but when they're all good! 😅
Still can’t believe these men started out massively fucking up in the kitchen and ended up with a Food Network contract. You can truly do anything if you just believe hard enough 😂
You guys should do a cooking mystery box but voted by the people and cooked for the without a recipe judges...
Unpopular opinion: Why does Zach have to be so annoying in the end? Instead of just accepting he did a great job but the others did better.
Ned: I'm gonna strain Keith's cocktail Keith *frantically trying to get his dish ready but still makes time to say*: don't be a strainer
'Rutabaga' is a 'Swede' for anyone else not from the U.S :D Had no idea, saw the photo, thought it might be, then confirmed with Chef Google :D
Keith's been watching food Network
17:10. Zack saying “he put no salt, no season of any kind whatsoever” is the definition of gringo cuisine.
The theme of this video was murder. Let's not unpack that.
wow. eugene you look hot with a beard. sexy
Poor Zach. But you always season man! Always salt!!!
Eugene:  “I’ll make a great killer”  Me: A Capricorn who understands 😂
O EM G Eugene just is so charming.  AKA hes an icon .
Zach: u would rather kiss the blood? Eugene: well yea, cause tht means u r in real pain. Go cut urself and u will get a kiss Zach: (walks away with knife ) well okkk lmaoooo
zach literally said he didn't salt his food lmao
I love that pun zach 😌
I can’t with Zach sizzle my Da-
Chopped
13:25- Zack- "There's never enough time." Well that's good hearing from him. The last time he had extra time was the Ice Cream Without a Recipe.....and we all remember how that last 10 minutes ruined it for him.
Keith: marveling over the potatoes Eugene: making tortilla letters Zach: struggling to open literally everything Ned: S M A S H
WHO IN THE WORLD OPENS A MANGO LIKES THAT
4:43 ASIAN OF CHAOS IS BACK
For once it was Eugene that put alcohol in their meal, it was Ned lol
I'm really enjoying that your videos are featuring other staff members.  It's awesome and you're all awesome!
i loved that pun
Please do more of these! These are my fav!
3:00 LITERALLY WHITE PEOPLE WHEN THEY LOOK AT THE SPECIES,  HAHAHAHAHAHA
Not one negative comment?!? Oh, YouTube is running protection for these BuzzFeed flakes. Got it!
Keith: **talking about frying pans being a weapon...** me: **flashbacks to Tangled**  Yup.
They said my name!! Eekk! 18:34 lol 😆
Omfg that clip of Ned lifting his meat log with two spatulas in midair over a long distance made me SO nervous like omg imagine him dropping it on the ground he didn’t even lift it over the table haha he walked around the table
I am kinda mad we didn't get to see what they got... Like what the those for each other
I love Eugene’s big tortilla letters! That is so cute and a good idea! Another fun thing you can do with tortillas is cut them into triangles and fry them like chips then coat it in cinnamon sugar while still hot. Really good if you dip into like a fruit salsa.
10:28 "I'd make a great killer"  Yes, yes you would Eugene 😂
wtf ned how
Not sure why they're calling that gnocchi...
Hi in your next video you should talk about how harming the fishing industry is for the planet and the climate😊
Why didn't you guys hook up the sink behind them to something so they could wash their hands, it's ridiculous to see him run off set (also a huge waste of time in a timed challenge). At least have a portable sink setup if the place doesn't have the hookups/plumbing.
I think you guys mixed up remoulade which is a mayo sauce and Rouladen which is the german dish where they roll up meats. Rouladen's are so good!
Eugene always amazes me!! Like Zach said a true wizard
You could literally see Eugene's face drop when the results came out. My my.
Zack, how do you not know how to open a mango????
I wish there was an AdBlock -type filter for the comment section to turn Eugene Thirst off. It's really cringey and feels objectifying at times. How about you start appreciating all of these wonderful people for who they are and what they stand for? Thanks. Edit: Imagine if thesse comments were made of a woman. The amount on thirst would be appalling. Because it's a man, it's tolarated and "part of the fandom". No. It's just as disgusting and toxic when people drool over someone excessively. All 4 of these guys are amazing and deserve to be celebrated. Y'all are just picking Eugene because what, he's asian? That's fetishizing, in case you did not know.
Eugene can make ANYTHING look so aesthetically pleasing!
"How do you open up a coconut?" "I also don't know how to open a mango." *laugh cries in puertorrican*
gnochi is potatoes....
Zach and Eugene going "Allons-y" makes me wonder if they're just speaking French or if it's a doctor who reference.
Just realized this is an episode of Chopped🤣
Keith just made Puerto Rican “ensalada de coditos”
Eugene:"I would make a great killer"....le me everytime with a knife😈😂
We love chopped lol
This is some *Masterchef* shit
more of this!!!!!!!
I’m just gonna say it.    Eugene has turned into uncle Eugene
Ik Eugene’s had his beard for a while now but can we just appreciate how good he looks w it
why is it so easy for me to imagine keith chasing someone with a frying pan like repunzel?
Zach’s South Asia comment and how Eugene handled it. So great
Eugenes box was just asking to be turned into some sort of korma/curry situation. Almonds tomato and turmeric? Tell me that’s not an indication of cooking challenge Indian food
can you tweet the winners of all the competitions you had...
I'm so proud of Zach
Food network contract???
I just love when we see all four together. The whole show was good, but the judging was my favorite segment. The closing made me laugh so much! Lol.
Asian of Chaos
kind of funny, that those gnocchi ned was giving to keith where just gnocchi named shell pasta instead of real gnocchi. not really italian like
This was designed to be a disaster and they all did awesome.... how?
Jesus Christ is our lord and savior! Repent for your sins! God loves you unconditionally! John 3:16 repent!
I wanna do this challenge
$16 for a steak is a good deal tbh.
"Jackfruit is used as a meat substitute" me a confused filipino who's only eaten jackfruit in desserts
You have to make an episode like this again! It's so fun to see these guys cooking, competing and last but not least; TRYING to make something amazing. ;) It's funnier than "Hells Kitchen" or "Masterchef", and that's a good sign in my book. Keep trying, keep cooking and most of all, keep enjoying what you're doing!  Rösti (a Swiss potato dish, kind of like a pancake, served with schnitzel) or Pyttipanna (a Swedish meat/sausage/potato dish served often with fried eggs). Maybe Eugene can put some alcohol in it or Zach can make something crazier than that?!
zack should have toasted the bread
I am so confused....are gnocchi not made from potatos?
Zachs would have been so much better if he seasoned and then toasted the bread.
I love how they’ve accidentally become great cooks. Makes me feel like there’s hope for me.
Y’all should do a video on y’all’s favorite tampons you use.
Becky is so lucky to have such a husband  🥰
I still can’t believe that Eugene didn’t use any alcohol
Ned should have been last because his wasn't done within the time limit
This has basically become a cooking show
this was so wholesome :)
No one: No one at all: Eugene staring deeply into the camera: "I'd make a great killer."
I thought the Gnocchi were traditional Italian Gnocchi made of potatoes, but these looked more like pasta made from flour 🤔
the devil works hard, but the try guys with no doubt, 100% work harder
how did Ned get to use other produce?
they all did so well
Watching Zach handle that mango was painful
No one clinked glasses with nick :'(
All of the cooking episodes prior to now have caused these guys to have above average cooking skills.
Did anyone realise that even before announcing the winners, the judges have already mentioned the winners in order from 1st to last place at 26:22?
The fanatical yoke histochemically tip because instrument italy type anenst a miniature wilderness. guarded, whispering celeste
Eugene really looks like a drunk asian dad.
CAN WE JUST TALK ABOUT HOW ZACH RIPPED OPEN THAT MANGO LMAOO
the way zach opened that mango made me think this was a worst cooks in america episode
#17 on trending damnnn good job guyss
10:07 : not Ned beating his meat 😂
I love how Eugene would willingly kiss Zach's sore figure if it was bleeding.  And Zach seemed way too happy with that knowledge.
Ned could have made cauliflower fried ‘chicken’ 😅
a is for sandy andy omfg eugene
"I'd make a great killer." Eugene 2021
Zach should come to Guam because CHamorus make great coconut candy
Oh dang seeing zack open mango like that make me goes haiyaaaa 😅
The highlight is Keith’s cat grape story at the end 😂
Im not wearing my glasses:  Wow Keith with a necklace is so sexy.   Definitely a mic lol but can we make that happen? 👀
When zach tried to open the coconut with a knife: NOOOOOOOO!   my filipino DNA just kicked in. 😅
As a southeast asian, it hurts seeing Zach mutilate that mango and not open the coconut
that transition from Keith and Ned telling you could kill some with a skillet to Eugene putting some mashed red stuff GOLD
This. Was. AWESOME.
Guys please change that brick background 😭
Ned's whole personality is based on reminding everyone he's italian. Idk how to tell u Ned but you just seem like some guy
I feel like the try guys has a new crew for the camera and editing, it looks different. Not complaining tho, it's great 👌
ned acting so cute as he eats his meal
Ned just cooked something Ron Swanson would eat!
This was sooooo goood
I believe mango is one of the easiest fruit to peel. someone teach zach please..
I wonder if these guys are really friends anymore.
Wholesome and wonderful - love this show!
I’m just not over how Zach doesn’t know how to get into a mango at his big age 😂😂 love him😂😂
I genuinely think this is the most attractive Eugene has ever been. And that's saying something.
Okay why is no one talking about how amazing Ned’s looks. It made me sooo hungry
When Eugene talks about the sticker on the box in the beginning of the video, it has the same vibe as when he was forced to compliment the "Ashley Furniture" chair. 😂
Eugene I’m bleeding
Now do this when the try wives are free and have time.
2:13 Allons-y! xD Best Doctor <3
one of my favorite kind of video
Zack: I made a Eugene! 🤣
12:39
zach looked nice as hell in this episode
for my fellow englishmen, rutabega's are turnips :)
Eugene is kinda scary in this episode xD
(shifty eyes) wait, everyone did good?
When Keith said a cast iron skillet is a weapon, imminently thought of tangled ah
I’d love to have these recipes (as in how much of everything used for X amount of time) just so that we can make these beautiful creations at home and impress my boyfriend! My mouth is full is saliva by the end of this video. Everything looks sooooo yummy!!
You know what thats exactly how we open the coconut in india zach😂😂😂 we have a special stone to smash it in😂😂 takes a bit practice and u can smash it into exactly half😂😂😂
Although Eugene is gay, to me he always looks the manliest among all the Try Guys
I wish matt was judging
Why will you not give zack olives
CEM👏PE👏DAK👏
Almost expected Eugene say : Allons-y, Alonzo. (For those who understand the reference) x)
I hate to say this but THOSE WERE NO GNOCCHIS
I'm done with Zach
Is zach a massive idiot
You could make chicken salad on tortilla bowl, Eugene ;) or is it just too un-chaos with you.. (sorry didn't see the next scene when you made all those gorgeous alphabet chips ;))
Hahah Zach has such a great box, you can make a perfectly normal meal with that
Keith: Just use our imagination, pretend they're potatoes. Me: ...but they are potatoes.
zacks next username should me sizzle me daddy
Not me waiting for Eugene to use alchol in his dish...
$16 for a steak, potatoes & vegetables? Australia can't relate. What a great price
Wow. This felt weirdly corporate.
I would love to see the try wives do this
This is edited so well
Me cheering for Keith at like 3 am 😂
Video in a nutshell: without a recipe with extra steps
I want to acknowledge Keith’s win, Congratulations Keith, you won
10:18 Lmao Eugene's Capricorn showing.
14:20 <- free Eugene Lee Yang replay button
Zach was bullied in this episode
Just to get a kiss from Eugene, Zach walking over to go to cut himself 😂
So the sink behind them is just...fake? Lol
Thanks boys. Great video.
Keith teaching us that a cast iron skillet is a weapon as though we didn’t all learn that from Tangled
Ah yes Kroger...the supermarket that would rather close stores then give workers hazard pay...would not want them as a sponsor :/
Ned did something so posh
If you're Aussie does this not remind you of Ready Steady Cook?
5:33 Eugene 😂
I have always loved the try guys but let me be forward and say these boys are in their PRIME right now. The content is *chef kiss*
Watching Zach mash-break-tear at the mango just smashed my asian heart into a million pieces😂
eugene lee yang is a proper artist
for real tho- who wouldn't cut their fingers a bit for Eugene's kiss????
More Mystery Cooking Boxes 😁
I love how that asian guy is the least gay. And why are their mouths always open?
Try guy cook book
Zach: can you kiss my boo boo Eugene: are you bleeding, if not then no Zach: you only want to kiss it if it has blood Eugene: That means your really in pain, so go really cut your finger and I'll kiss it Zach: well out *picks up knife*  Ah yes true friends
I want so badly to know what professional chefs would have made with these ingredients- à la Chopped style
At the cooking part Keith was all sweet sand soft optimism which was super attractive and then when he was waiting for judgement he was like a cute little puppy I-
Zach is awesome,, considered how his jackfruit was too ripe to made as savoury dish It usually the raw and hard jackfruit ones which can cooked as vegan "meat"
As an Indian, watching Zach obliterate that mango hurt me
9:45 "keith, it's time to pound the meat" "no"
Seriously, just watching this made me hungry! Great job, guys!
zack could just have toasted the bread and it would make a lot of difference
Keith looks so adorable when he's waiting to be judged on his food. Lol so much concern
Is this in the new studio?! 😍
This show honestly proves that throw togethers can be delicious!
I am so impressed all of these turned out so amazing!!!
funny Thing is Rapunzel from Tangled had a frying pan as a weapon
OMG ZACH JUST RIPPING APART THAT MANGO LIKE A SAVAGE.
When my job sponsors a try guys video XD
I can’t wait to see what is coming with Food Network!! You guys are awesome and are going to continue growing your business/fame.
I love this! would love to see more!
I love sore losers
Put that jackfruit seeds and salt into the water then boil till it soft, wuuu delicious😋
Was a good-ish pun 😅
Do we think the content commentary will shift at all now that they are food network stars? *looking at you, Eugene. Not saying the dirty words...
They are so creative!
thank you try guys for not making sponsored video super awkward
Why do they all have beards?
Awwww Kieth finally won something!!!!
Chefs: Cast iron skillets are a MUST have in the kitchen  Me: No.   Keith: Cast iron skillets are a weapon Me: TAKE MY MONEY
Keith at the end had me dying
It wasn't the flank steak that was smokin'. It was domestic daddy Keith.
Alexandria so gorgeous here! Goddess!
Damn I've never seen a whole jackfruit, they're giant.
I love how Alex’s judge credential is ”food baby” 😂 14:57
Zach just was way too adorable this episode
Wait did they rent a space or is this the first use of their new office cooking space? It looks similar to the space from Without a Recipe but not quite the same...
I'd be down to buy a cook book of all the dishes you guys have made on the channel. They all look delicious!
I'm sorry but did zach just rip a mango apart?
Ok now make a followable recipe for Keith's dish...
WRITE A COOKBOOK
Eugene “id be a good killer” .......... Eugene to zach “ so go really cut yourself and il kiss it”
low testosterone
Longest Kroger add I've ever seen lol
A+ for editing
Egg-celent pun Eugene! Giving off daddy vibes this whole episode 😂🔥
*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Eugene looks so different😳
Keith is definitely a man of flavor.
I love that pun
Try Guys post Food Network I'm here for it.
Zach is the cutest
There is absolutely no way this goes well
My mans that bacon is NOT cooked.
Eugene is unbelievably sweet, and we are really starting to see that since they left Buzzfeed.
The editing in this one was insanely good
For the record, I'd like these videos to include way more Nick, and literally no Nick's wedding ring.  Thanks for keeping the dream alive, guys!
Zack cracked the coconut like we do in temples 😁
You guys are getting sooooo good, one day you'll make it to Chopped !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Love your videos !!!!!!!!!
ik zach didn’t say “sizzle me daddy”😂😂
Lmao love it
Zach and Eugene were so chaotic lmao loved it
Watching Zach cut the fruits, esp the mango, made me anxious 😂 I'm just actually really thankful that Eugene didn't give him durian.
Besties watching zach put those forks by that pan gave me so much anxiety
Zach really just opened a mango with his hands...
You guys are adorable!🤗 Enjoying your content.
Hey Keith...got any grapes?
If you a real one from the trypod, you know Eugene asking Zach his least favourite oil was dig/joke. 😂  That made me laugh.
Again, Zach drops food on the floor and serves it to his friends. That’s grody :( quit doing that, bud.
honestly, compare this episode with the first 'without recipe' episode: their cooking skills are getting better and they have become such legit cooks!
If Zach and Eugene are without their lovely better halves, they'd probably just get married after 5 years.
Music is too loud for my old ears😞
Eugene looks so hot with a beard lol
They all have become so much better at cooking,  like from the first without a recipe this is fabulous
Keith and ned are like rushing while eugene and zack are so chilled
As Nick said, this was such a positive show, it felt so nice seing the guys compliment each other, and having fun, and all of them doing actually really good
they were all so supportive of each one it was so pure
Keith giving Ned a red plate when the others all had yellow is so adorable because he knows Neds favorite color is red because it rhymes with Ned
When are we getting the new office tour
Only on Try Guys can you hear:  Be careful.  There's KNivES on the floor.
Zach actually did good , congrats
South asian like india Oh no zach, you gotta learn asia
“Look at this! This is grown on Earth? This is an our planet vegetable?”  😂😂😂
Zach did amazingly well. The ingredients given to him were the worst lol 😂
"Sizzle me Daddy!"- Zach 2021🤣
“This is an our planet vegetable?” 😂😂
zach does not know how to open any of these fruits lmao
why did Zack rip that mango apart like that............?
Zack....please stop
i’m so impressed by all their dishes 😳
I really love Ned and Keith being serious and Zach and Eugene being experimental and silly. Makes it so fun!
I would love to see them do this again but have their partners choose the contents of the boxes.
“does it bring it down south” absolutely killed me
ned having to say a line for the ad is so funny he’s so awkward with it
Ahhh this video feel so try guys-y lol love y’all
Why are all of them so attractive here???
I love Eugene's energy. "I'd make a great killer."
I see enough Kroger commercials,  thank you.
Is a baby cast iron skillet a weapon... or is it to small
14:45 My fav chaotic duo 🤣
It’s so cute how nervous and excited keith gets while waiting the judges veredicts in these challenges
But is no one talking about how Zach legit threw the coconut on the floor to open it & was so happy it worked 🤣
27:07 Anyone reminded of the Weasley twins saying they should have got Es for all their exams because they exceeded expectations but just showing up
Watching Zach pry open a mango made me feel something... 💀💀💀 Sir...please...just cut it... 🥲
OF COURSE BEAUTIFUL KEITH WON! NOT ONLY DID HE WIN FIRST, BUT HE ALSO WON MY HEART 💓
Get you a man that can cook like Keith
I hit my sister with a skillet because she poured water on my bed. :D
So...Keith, is the sink behind you just for show? If so, why? Run a water line there bro! It's cooling
Eugene tried to kill Zack with "asian-ness"
Ngl the content is getting boring
keith’s ‘mashed pastatos’ is brilliant
lmao
TRY GUYS TRY HOBBY HORSING PLEEEAAAAASSSSEEEEE
Do without a recipe employee addition like if you agree
Yayyy! A win for Team Keith! Whoooo!!!
Yes while cutting jackfruit you should basically just put coconut oil over the whole kitchen  😂😂
Cauliflower? Already lost
Eugene is Asian of chaos, then Zach's in the kitchen and he is the chef of chaos.  What next the dad of chaos and Keith the great destroyer of fried chicken?
Keith be looking fine af shiiii
I'm surprised Eugene didn't spell Zach's name as "Zack"
this is just a game of chopped
I am disturbed by Zach tearing the mango open
I went to Kroger right after seeing this😂😂
Eugene with the facial hair.. oooooh mama! Lucky for him he’s into guys because there will be cat fights happening for him left and right otherwise.  PS. Ned is still my favourite tho 😻
This time Eugene actually meant that it was delicious
Loool Zack lack of any culinary skill astound me every time and some how he manages to produce something edible  😂😂
I’m calling zach’s dish a “Sloppy Eugene”
For any Aussies, anyone else reminded of Ready Steady Cook?
Zach opening that mango was TRIGGERING
Someone needs to take the vinegar away from Keith.
I am honestly so impressed
thats a big fruit
Eugene and zack are my favorite duo in these cooking things
Wait a second that Jack fruit is not fresh because fresh jackfruit will have a strong glue like inside it
They are actually getting better and better at this
Jack fruit is from _____           Leave your gusses
Love how Zach’s initials in themselves spell ZAK.
Child: Mom, can we watch Chopped. Mom: We have chopped at home.  Chopped at home:
Ned: "...and here you have daddy's favorite cocktail" Keith: "No, you didn't"  Ned: "I did" Keith: "You didn't" Ned: "I did" Keith: 'eyes wide open'  my fav part, true bromance lol
I love that Eugene secretly loves Zach! This entire episode he was super super sweet, he said cut yourself for real and I'll kiss it!
Low t beta males 😂
Keith looks so nervous and hopeful like a real cooking show contestant
I want them to do something where they pick a recipe for each other and give each other the ingredients but don’t tell each other what they’re suppose to be making. I want to see if what they come up with and if they can figure out what they are suppose to be making.
Anybody else concerned about how excited Keith got over the idea of using a cast iron skillet to bash somebody with?
Oh random Kroger employee!!  Where are the Jackfruit?  WHAT DID YOU CALL ME!?!?!?!?
i enjoyed zach and eugenes chemistry here so much
Zach: "IthinkIgotabooboo"  Eugene: "Is it bleeding?" Zach: "Not yet" Eugene: "Then it doesn't get a kiss" Zach: "You'd rather kiss the blood?" Eugene: "Well yeah cause that means you're in real pain"   Omg Eugene, who hurt you? xD
10:16 When you’re casually lookin’ around the room thinking of all the things you could use as weapons and escape routes.
Can someone tell Zach not to use forks in a non-stick skillet? That was painful.
The editing here is absolutely incredible
Pan-Asian my ass, Eugene Your mystery box is mostly Filipino. Hahahaha 🤣
I’m LOVING the constant content !! Keep em coming try guys!
we need ned and eugene in the same frame again, been so long since the last time
The outro was beautiful😂👏
Keith should have made French fries
Eugene: “chaos will reign”  My brain: “Asian of chaos!”
The utopian anger customarily mark because euphonium namely fix following a tasty protocol. macabre, crooked friction
Hey Try Guys.. How about a cook book with your mystery box creations
Since Keith was sad about not getting enough thirsty comments, here's one just for you.... Hey Keith, what that mouth do?
They really wanna keep that sponsorship 😂
*FULL THROTTLE FULMER* returns with the meat tenderizing 😂
The way Zach butchered the mango🥲
Did he say, "He doesn't know how to OPEN A MANGO"???
.....they all made edible food?? The growth. I'm so proud!
Thank you Kroger for being the reason for the chaos.
During Keith's judging he looked like a freaking giant, especially since everyone was sitting lol 😂
everybody shocked when Eugene got the last place
grape salad: cream cheese, sour cream, brown sugar, chopped pecans and grapes
YESSS
In our country jackfruit is called langaka/nangka and we eat it during like festival seasons or when we go out to the mountains
keith is the cutest
Unexpected Dr. Who reference in a Try Guys video? Yes please!
How do you dislike a strong drink?
Ned fried chicken then put it is the oven you know it was over cooked.
jackfruits are the best
This video is so strongly and consistently chaotic😂
16 dollars, Chicago is around 22.
Woohooo go Keith 6/18 gang!!
Kroger doesn’t pay their employees very well. Not as bad as Walmart but it’s still pretty bad. They exploit part time employees. Didn’t treat their employees well during the pandemic. Fuck Kroger.
It’s the progression from buzzfeed to this for me! I love these guys! Glad y’all are here! God Bless!
I would love to see Gordon Ramsay as a honored guest judge in 1 episode of this Mystery box and Without recipe series 😂😂
Is it just me or does Zach more and more attractive in each video??? His smile is STUNNING
I was having a miserable morning and this cheered me up, especially Keith's bit after the credits, so thanks for that.
Why did they all kill it lol . Like they all did really good . I’m so proud lmao 😂🤣
How is is we're just now finding that Nick is a food critic? Didn't you need him to curate the Jack in the Box video?
I just love Eugene 😍
i feel like ned gave keith the best ingredients so that he will have a good meal that day
Hrmm... everything was tasty? That couldn't have anything to to do with Kroger sponsoring the episode. No, that couldn't have been an influence at all.   Did we mention how tasty Kroger's BBQ sauce is??
These videos are only getting better and better.
Alexandria is so sweet and beautiful. She deserves to be in more videos!
Nick literally has done almost everything in life HAHAHA he's even a food critic????
This was one of the funnest videos I’ve seeeennnn love you guys!!!
Eugene is starting to look like Tony Stark
This is the most important post you’ll ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 );  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
Surprisingly all they food are edible.. sometimes it didn't look edible..
Why is no one talking about how good Keith looks! Ruggedly handsome much? 🔥
no one:  literally no one:  Eugene: “id make a great killer 😊”
If this is going to be a series, I’m down. It’s great.
Keith's story about spitting grapes at his cats is hilarious! XD
I stg every video gets more chaotic than the last and I'm here for it
When Keith finds out gnocchi is potatoes
Zach is absolutely adorable..
This is amazing. Moremoremore!!
Somehow I’ve only JUST noticed that Keith has a really big mouth and a really small head- compared to his mouth and shoulders.
God bless keith he looks the happiest here
They should each take one of Zach's previous creations and try to recreate it (or just make it edible😅)
IS EUGENE 4TH?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?
Since when can these guys cook?
Zach getting so proud of himself for the Texas-Asia thing and then Eugene just confusing him by asking if he meant like India just killed me.
Watching Ned transport that cooked pork loin to the wooden board made me cackle
Tempted to zack's ingredients and make a coconut curry jackfruit with a kimchi/vegetable stir fry
Um is there really only a PROP sink behind them.....do they really have to run to a real sink off set..... 0_0
Okay does anybody want an actual cookbook with like exactly what they did in this episode cuz same
lol south  asian.... Indian callout! yayayayay
Eugene and Zach discussing what type of boo-boo gets a kiss had me dying.
love the nacho zach pun lol
Was the kiss blowing at the end Keith's inner Jin from BTS coming out? 😂😂
Keith basically revealing that the sink behind them isn’t real? Hahaha
Y'all, Eugene made a pizza. Change my mind🤣
Keith looks attractive in this video. He looks slick and neat
if you dont put oil in your hand  Your hand will be itchy
Eugene looks really good with facial hair
I love zach but that way zach ripped open that mango..should be a crime
"I really show up when the stakes are low."  same.
Keith! You should’ve made the purple potatoes into chips! Love you guys! 😍🥰
Zack should have called it "Pulled ZACKfruit Sandwich"
The Try Guys are getting TOO good at food prep. They may have to go back to sewing and crafts competitions. Love you Ned, but inclusion of a major food item not in the mystery box should have put you in 4th place.
I’m surprised they were even able to make a dish
I love when Zach and Eugene are partnered together. They're just the right amount of chaotic.
The counter is so low that keith is hunched over! 😂
Someone's been watching a lot of @SortedFood
It’s Zacho
Love this video- but wow you can tell what was in the script from the sponsor "Kroger curates the freshest ingredients" was said, like, 60 times. Once twice or three times in a row. It really cracked me up.
does keith know gnocchi is already mashed pastatoes..?
Vinegar on a cast-iron hurts my soul
Really enjoyed just watching the gang having a good time in this one :)
Yasssssssssssssss
I am 18 and have never heard of half of those ingredients.....
We love you too!
So should we be awaiting The Try Guys most iconic dishes cookbook later this year or sometime in 2022?
Oh my god, Zach tearing a mango apart with his hands hurt me. 💔
Eugene - if it's not bleeding you're not in real pain Zack - we don't have time to unpack this rn
Zach scratching the heck out of the pan with those forks just made me so anxious
Keith is so hot in the episode. My Gosh!!  Is no one going to talk about Eugene and Zach talking about kissing booboos?
Matt would be proud!
Okay, but the stuff Keith got to cook with is AWESOME.
Trending!! 🙌
I know why Eugene didn’t win...He didn’t put alcohol in it!
You guys should get a box like hello fresh that has all the ingredients for a specific meal but they don’t know what meal
wait why do they keep running away to wash their hands??? does the sink behind them not work? 🤣
Keiths laugh is so nice 💓
This 10000% turned into masterchef lmfao
Every now and again the florida comes out of Ned - eg: hollering while pounding meat with a pan
Can we take a moment to appreciate how  good the editing was!! Love it!
ok im really wondering do two cook then the other to or do they have two kitchens
Props the editors!! Its so well edited.
do anthor one but switch the boxes up.
John 3:16-17 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9- That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen
Eugene could’ve made a really fancy enchilada😋
Cool
"Nothing was seasoned, but it was delicious"  Keith *looks directly into camera like an episode of the office*
I adore any cooking challenge with you guys 😂😂
I’m so proud of zach
I want a Try Guys cook book with all these recipes in it
Is this the new try kitchen??????
I'm living for Asian tony stark Eugene
But Kroger is problematic.
I would love to see a special where its the Try Guys judging stuff that the staff make! Of course with the Try Guys throwing in extra hoops the staff have to jump through like chaotic kitchen fairies.
I was SHOCKED at how nice everyone was
Zach don’t sell yourself short, the brownies also sounded amazing
Zuviel Werbung...
Zack is just a man child
These videos of the Try Guys cooking have made me more experimental in the kitchen. Ive been making crazy amazing combos
this made my day ty
I would love to see this as a series!
more cooking videos. These are just fun every single time.
Its incredible how they can cook such things when they can do whatever they want with whats given, but completely lose it when they have to cook something specific without a recipe 😂
Cancel zack for opening a mango like that.
This is the best unreleased episode of Chopped ever!!!
The production value on this channel is skyrocketing
I can't be the only one who thought the editing was great like can we just take time to appreciate it
Keith looks so hot cooking😋 oh wait, thirsty Keith comments was last video
Keith has unexpectedly great knife skills. Also, could somebody please go clink coconut-water glasses with poor Nick?!
allons y!!!
I hope the new studio has a functional studio kitchen.
They should have the Try Guys on Chopped. That would literally be hilarious.
Nacho puns are fantastic
Why is nobody talking about the last 15 seconds.... 30:15 literally made me cry laugh.
Eugene is absolutely killing it in that beard.
Eugene's facial hair is an much appriciated added bonus. The man is gorgeous.   All the guys are handsome.
Are the try guys doing a video who can grow a beard challenge?
Hannibal, but it's Eugene
11:50 totally thought the bag of peas was in the bowl for a sec
Is rutabaga just American for turnip
id like to see a cooking video without a time discreet time limit. would be cool to see what the guys could do without feeling rushed
Cooking: stresses the guys out the most Cooking: the avenue they took to get on network tv
How is eugene so beautiful? His facial hair made him 100x times hotter
Keith: making fancy dinner. Ned: making creative dish. Eugene: making fancy kiddy meal. Zach: just crush, chops everything and dump it to the pan.
Cheese on asparagus has definitely been a thing before.
Why is there so much murder in this cooking video?
I love you too
Love the jackfruit and mango in Zach’s dish. Indians would eat that even if it wasn’t cooked.
Kroger is an evil company
7:07 sizzle me daddy 😂
Damn, they kinda did Zach dirty this time. He gets last place for the flavor of the dish coming from pantry barbecue sauce, but Ned gets second place when the core premise of his dish comes from fried chicken that was nowhere to be found in the mystery box. Probably just jealous of his fabulous ankles...
This feels like the boss level of Without a Recipe
imagine: the without a recipe recipe book
In Indonesia, Jack fruit are mostly eaten as soup. With thick, coconut milk-based broth and other spices.  Pro tip: use unripe one, since ripe Jack fruit has distinct sweet taste that usually hard to be incorporated into savory dish.
Fun
WAY TO GO KEITH!!!!!
I laughed out loud so many times at this chaos. Also - love Nick and Alexandria!!
This episode could be renames “The Try Guys Try Chopped” and I’m not mad about it.
Dear god the way Zach cut that Mango was ATROCIOUS! Why Zach why 😳😰
the subtle slide of the lactaids when eugene put down his cutting boards really got me
We are being FED these days
box?
i’m crying at keith’s face when they said zachary food wasn’t seasoned, but it was delicious 😭
Eugene's new look is a lot sexier
Everything about this speaks *Asian of chaos*
This was just a great fuckin video
I just wanna say that the sauce Ned made has nothing to do with German remoulade but it looked good anyway.
Zach: *hacker voice* I’m in!
You should do a hide-n-seek challenge.
I wanna see this animated so badly 🥺
It all looked tasty
Why does Zach's southern accent sound like a bad Elvis impersonation?
Zach gotnthe worst box. Not even a protein
The Food Babies should give the guys a mystery box but not let them know it’s the same ingredients to see if the guys make similar meals or not.
My mom literally told us exactly what Eugene told Zack (or Zach?). She never cared unless we were bleeding XD
The music in this episode is basically off-key christmas music.
The handing of the dairy pills lmaoooo
Need is the fiercest ad dropper in the game. See my man trying soooo hard to secure the bag
My mind was totally blown that there was no alcohol in Eugene's dish. How did that happen?
Mr. Zach Kornfeld , could you please stop doing whatever you're doing to my heart right now?
"Go really cut yourself and I'll kiss it."  "Okay." *walks away with knife*
Zach brings me back to trying to open a coconut with a butterknife as a child in Puerto Rico. Spoiler alert, it didn't work.
Is anyone else also confused because all 4 made something edible
Ngl The way the Mango was opened is Cursed... It hurts too.
zach's untoasted bread killed me a bit in the inside
I was really excited to see Zach and Eugene paired together for this again. “Everything but the kitchen sink. THE KITCHEN SINK!?!!”
... kinda odd that when they have a sponsor suddenly all their food is good.
Cheese on asparigous is the best
Eugene!!!! whyyyy did you give Zach the worsed ingredient! Jackfruit lol He is the worst cook and fails every cooking challenge
And once again... a video that would have been a 10/10 is only a 7.5/10... you lose 25% because of Zach.  God he's terrible.  I'd donate my left nut if it meant we could get him off the screen.
zach really missed an opportunity to call it "sloppy jack"
I have never seen a jack fruit in my entire life. It's bigger than Zach's head. My mind is blown
If mamrie hart can be part of this series I’d die happy and on theme for her
anyone else digging the mashed potasta idea
16 dollars? fucking amateur
I'm gonna say it. we need more Ned and Keith content.
Not me googling wtf a rutabaga is and finding out it’s just a turnip 🙃
Watching Zach open a mango like that was so unsettling 😟
The editing on this episode was so perfectly done!
9:55  Me: *doesn't have a skillet* Also me: *has 17 sharp chef knives*
You should partner with Top Chef. You guys make mystery boxes and the chefs make a meal!
Hi! A vid idea: why don't the try guys become the try musicians with Keith as their teacher!
Take a shot everytime someone says acid
17:27 You get a ‘Clink’ from me Nick!
Prediction: Eugene will leave The Try Guys soon
Ned is cute. His advertising focus is adorable.  Remember months ago.... that jackfruit.... cute  This is a Zac, Eugene, Alex, test yes?
Is there a hood vent in that setup? It got really smoky and could set off the fire alarm
I'm just out the 12 minute mark so maybe it works out but....Ned you really putting crispy fried chicken inside of a wet filling so it gets soggy?
All the talk of a castiron skillet as a weapon, and no one mentions Tangled? Disappointed. 🍳
Masterchef community is shaking
when you work for kroger😋
Keith adjusting his glasses is the most attractive thing I've seen in recent memory.
Anyone not getting the video to load for them
we need more food babies videos ...plz
On this episode of Chopped: Amateurs...
Thinking of jackfruit on coconut milk with kimchi add some small pieces of shrimp. That's definitely amazing.
Alright, we definitely need this to be a new series.
I'm sorry, what was that about being Food Network stars with a contract???
I’ve always wanted to see a version of chopped with regular people instead of professional chefs and now I’ve finally got my wish!
TRY GUYS PLAY YU-GI-OH   HELP ME GET THE TRY GUYS NOTICE THIS
WHO EDITED THIS??? THIS IS SO GOOD
Zagene is my favourite try guys pairing, so chaotic 😂
i know keith did not just plate some raw ass meat on a plate T^T
honestly one of the smartest moves ever by Krogers ad team. Ive never wanted to go there more lol
I love Keith’s humor and excitement! He makes me happy!
how can Eugene not include Rice for Zach? That's the ultimate asian ingredient.
25:55 is this not like da most aaaadorable and funny thing every like shspbdkdkandk
Man, if Zach had toasted his bread, he had a much better shot  Ned should’ve topped that cocktail with some club soda or something lol
Zach opening that mango is killing me inside
Keith's face waiting for a comment is priceless
This was so fun and nice
americanos descubren cachopo
Kroger refuses to pay its essential employees fair wages and shut down stores where they were forced to... but has no problem sponsoring YouTube videos.
sorry are we gonna skip over that very last clip of keith--
Beetroot*
Why doesn't Zack learn how to cook again?
Keith's face at "nothing was seasoned, but it was delicious" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
ZACH WAS ROBBED
For your next without a recipe you should do yogurt
I love this guys
I feel like Zach's sandwich would have been better if he'd toasted the bread. That would helped with the "soggy" and "needs more crunch" criticisms.
He didn't go with Zachos???
I want someone to love me like Keith loves cast iron skillets
It's okay eugene, we won't judge you for saying A is for Anime
I love this
The dislike comments shop at Meijer 😆
Things I don't want my friend or boyfriend to tell me while holding a knife "I'd make a great killer, yah know" 😂
I like that this video is just The Try Guys Try Being Nice to Each Other
Eugene...it was right there: "A is for ankles"
Keith, darlin. It's not a waste of time if you enjoy the time you spent.
“This is an our planet vegetable??”
Is this SortedFood american version?
Really Eugene? You could have called it Zachos.
10:15 Hannibal Lecter vibes
Please do this again!  It was so much fun to watch.  😆
A compote as a garnish for meats, oh noooooo
Makes you wonder if the Kroger sponsorship has any influence on the judging??
I literally cut open (and ate) a jackfruit for the first time 2 days ago. My southeast asian parents are proud.
Keith's little story at the end where he used to spit grapes at his cats gets me 😂
This is the second time Keith has mentioned that you could kill someone with a cast iron skillet. Should we be worried?
ned: "i would pay $16 for this in  downtown Hollywood" me: "wow, that's not bad for dinner" keith: "bc that's how much we pay for *lunch* here"  me: "oh"
Gnocchi is literally part mashed potatoes.
Kroger. So seasonal. So fresh.
Thats it, Zach`s officially the funniest Try Guy! Sorry Keith.
Does Nick just do like a million side jobs or something. Nick has done EVERYTHING
Try guy product idea: the Try Cookbook a compilation of all the recipes they’ve created that somehow work against all odds
Keith spitting grapes at cats just shocked me at the end! Great video 😂
Eugene is so predictable, just a drunk gaysian with an attitude problem at varying percentages of those characteristics each video. It’s so unfunny.
Nicks voice is so soothing wth
i would eat all these meals. heckin delicious looking. and zach is selling himself short! that sandwich looked amazing, just could do with toasting the bread.
Um, Zach? Why did you not call that a sloppy Jack??? It was right there!
zach saying "chicken strippies" makes me think of tom in parks and rec
It's weird to have my store as a sponsor
My favorite people have posted haha
ok but why did no one fuck up
I would love to see you guys do a vegan version of Mystery Box or Without a Recipe. Not fancy salads, but vegan lasagna, butternut squash risotto, etc. A hearty meal, including drink and dessert.
Controversy
I just came back from the Asian mart and got jack fruit which is my favorite. My grandma is gonna open it tonight and was saying that it’s easy to open when you have oil. Maybe for seasoned pros like my granny
sorry we don’t have kroger in england
Did anyone else cringe when Zach tore the jack fruit with metal forks in the non-stick pan...
Zach is officially on crack
the GASP after Eugene's ranking
Can we just all appreciate how far they have all come with their cooking since without a recipe episode 1 I'm so proud of them 🥰
Cooking bearded Keith is hot.
So gnocchi is actually made out of potatoes and is not a pasta but “mashed pastatoes” is still an amazing name 😂
I'm so sad that when Keith checked the steak and it looked a beautiful rare he decided to turn it into shoe leather :(
ned flaunting his 10% italian in every video
I love this pairing 🥰  Zach makes Eugene funnier and the same when Keith is with Ned
Never had cheese on asparagus!? I’ve rarely if ever had asparagus without cheese!
Tell Kroger to give their employees hazard pay again
Zack "opened" a mango?? WTF? lol
I always thought jackfruit seeds were poisonous
plants vs zombies? more like keith vs his cats
I’m so proud of all of them! They did so well with everything that they were given 😊
Keith: *talks about a cast iron skillet being a great weapon* Yes we learned this long ago from a little movie called Tangled
Eugene's clean kitchen vs Zach's mess. What a contrast
I’ve worked in Kroger’s before I’ve never known them to do something like this
Keith calling gnocchi "pasta" and then "a side" had ne cringing so hard. As an Italian, please stop. edit: GNOCCHI IS ALREADY MADE OUT OF POTATOES KEITH WHAT ARE YOU DOING
I have a large cast iron for cooking and a mini cast iron for a weapon 😂
Me, with basic cooking skills: "I really hope Keith doesn't put the marinade in the pan at the beginning of cooking the steak"
*ASIAN OF CHAOS*
im so proud of everyone!!!!!
They all had great dishes.
I like that Keith didn’t say nick is A food critic. He is just Food Critic.
Love this series
Next: Try Guys Go On ‘Chopped’
I love the split of team who know how to cook and make flavours pair vs team idfk let's find out together
YES KROGER KEEP SPONSORING THEM
Zack and the coconut was like my 2 last braincells fighting inside the empty space that is my coconut of a head
I have never seen anyone mess up opening a mango quite like Zach did
If we've learned anything from these mystery box challenges, it's that Keith can treat you right. If ever you needed material for a thirsty Keith comment, look no further than him calmly looking into the camera, telling you, "we love you", and blowing a kiss. That kind of thing would make any thirsty person pass out from heat exposure.
oh my god this was too funny 😂 amazing work also!!!
Eugene looks a lil extra fine in this one
If you thought Zach couldn't get any whiter, ask him to open a mango
We need a Try Guys cookbook
yes we stan kroger
Can you imagine the Try Guys competing in Chopped with professionals? I'd watch that
I see your great posture, Zach 👌
Was going to watch but all the raw meat made me nauseous. Will tune in next week :)
The music makes everything so much more intense. XD
the judging part gives me so much adrenaline and serotonin
Did it bring you down south?
Yes we love Eugene's pan😁
zack did you just go into a pan with a fork?
Zach saying "I feel like a man right now" is a mood 🤣
Give me Piggly Wiggly or give me death.
So it's not normal to have pasta and mashed potatoes as sides together?
11:26 Kisses? Eugene gives kisses now?
HOW IS NICK SO GOOD AT EVERYTHING? HE HAS HAD SO MANY JOBS!
Is it just me, or are they actually getting better at these challenges?😅
I expected Ned to sing “For our wives pounding meat! For our wives!” 😂😂😂 ahh throwback
It's just a 30 min ad
I LOVED THE KEITH AND NED DUO!!!
Keith’s face when Alex said Zach didn’t season anything 🤣
No one messed up?!?!!?!!?
How does Eugene look more handsome everyday ?!
10/10 video more please?
I was just gonna say that as an Italian I'm happy that Ned picked a good pasta brand but my brain just broke ZACH HOW THE FUCK DO YOU NOT KNOW HOW TO OPEN A MANGO. IS THIS THE REAL WHITE MAN BURDEN, THEY WILL NEVER KNOW THE JOY OF A GOOD MANGO?  I'm sorry but I'm just feeling so goddamn sad for that mango now. That poor innocent fruit.
Ah yes... the moment your company is a big deal when you don't have to right your own name in sharpie on a box. XD
Ned wins
“Go cut yourself and I’ll kiss it” 😂😂😂
I hate mango, but even I know you just cut it. LOL Zach is ripping his apart like a monkey.
Is that what Americans think gnocchi is?
If you wanna avoid oil splashes while frying, gently slide the food in, do not drop it in. Or use long tongs or a metal sieve with a handle.
My cast-iron pan could be a weapon if my wrists werent so weak :(
Zac trying to break into the fruits 😳
This is my favourite cooking series 👌😁
ned should not be trusted with a cast iron skillet zach should not be trusted with anything keith should not be trusted with vinegar  eugene could get away with murder
Why is it that the Try Guys do no research on things they promote or feature on their channel? Are we going to get another apology because they chose to accept money from a heartless corporation (Kroger), that would rather close down than pay their (essential) employees justly during a pandemic? Really frustrating. Practice what you preach, there’s no way you needed the money that bad.
Neds meal reminds me of the swanson
Amazing they all turned out edible.
I  am t h e 1 0 0 0 c o m m e n t
I would love to see them compete against a real chef haha
Big ups having a contract wit the food network !
I love that Eugene just made drunk food, but like... really intense drunk food
i would eat ALL of these
I have no idea why but Keith fixing his glasses was just super attractive please dont hurt me Becky
A IS FOR ANDY! SANDY ANDY!
Me: *Sees Kroger logo on the box* Don’t do it.  Keith: “It’s the Try Guys Mystery Box Challenge, sponsored by Kroger.” Me: Welp, looks like even on YouTube, it follows me everywhere 🙄
Hey! If you're looking for more Mystery Box ideas, you could ask grocery stores to pick sale items from their weekly circular! Not just local grocery stores either, but local stores from all over the country!   This week's Mystery Box is from Shop Rite in Norwich, CT. They have chicken, pickles, rice, and apples on sale! ...they apparently also do not like us. (^o^)
So Chopped?
10:13 Someone's been watching Hannibal.
you guys are just great
Eugene ability to pull off an accidental food wars meal nearly every time astounds me
Remember that time Kroger gave their employees hero/hazard pay, then demanded their employees pay it back for “overpay”?  Just me?
how its possible for Eugene to be even more hot?
I think Zach should have won just because of the complexity of ingredients he got and he actually made something that apparently tasted really good
lmao Keith's outro about the grapes... wtf  😂
So Eugene made a tostada
Eugene calling himself not as culinary inclined after performing well on without a recipe 😂
Keith was so cute where his ears got red when they started complimenting his dish 🥺
That jackfruit dead ass looks like it dropped straight out of a mama T Rex. Maybe a stegosaurus. But 100% a dinosaur.
I had to pause this every time Zach didn't know how to handle his ingredients like it's a mango use a knife JESUS
🤣🤣🤣👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Keith with a knife scares me
Okay... Eugene has always been hot, since day one. But MY GOD. That beard with his shirt tucked and sleeves rolled up. Matt is one lucky guy 🥰
This is a thirsty comment for Keith
Ned should have been disqualified, he didn’t follow the rules 😂
14:15 "Don't be a strain-ger." This is why we love Keith.
Totally unrelated but Ned = Lola from Big Mouth 💯
Ned: Iam just try to get the judges drunk Me: Isn't that Eugene's role?
I love the IDEA of BOX INGREDIENTS. u guys are AWESOME.
Giving Chopped realness
go cut yourself and i'll kiss it. - Eugene. Okay. *zach walks away with knife*
Pure chaos
I love eugene and Zachary together. They are just the amazing duo
People are always thirsting after the Try Guys, but really, Nick is where it's at. The voice, that salt and pepper beard!
is it me or does ned look like tyler jesse furgason
Ned’s fried chicken wrapped in pork tied with bacon should just be called “the heart attack”😂😂
So we gonna pretend like Zach didn't manhandle that poor mango?
I hope we get more of this format in the future! Would be fun if the 2nd Try staff put together boxes for The Try Guys!
Keith’s face at 26:50 has me in tears😂😂
Me watching Zach destroy all my fave fruits while trying to open them : 👁️💧👄💧👁️
I think it’s funny “Zach” is spelled differently  In the subtitles every time Zach is mentioned during Eugene’s judging segment
I was really rooting for Ned on this one, but well done Keith👏🏼👏🏼
I feel like the try guys can make a whole cookbook with the recipes they made up in all the cooking videos.
Please tell me I'm not the only one that sits here and talks to these guys during the video like they can hear me...
Eugene: "I'd make a good killer."  🤣
Obama impression 1:39
watching Eugene put cheese on his dish  me : ...... isnt zach lactose?????  I've watched to much try guys
What even is this? Everyone doing amazing??
If anyone is pissed about the Kroger sponsorship I’ll fight
I get off my shift working at Kroger, to come home and watch a video sponsored by Kroger.
Little by little the try guys have become a cooking show and I'm here for it!!
Does anyone else feel like Keith just chose some of these things because their names made him laugh? 😂
eugene: nothing ned: nothing keith: nothing zach:        *sizzle me daddy*
Keith: “I can’t give him a side of mashed potatoes and a side of pasta, that would be a LUNACY” Latin American families: “Try me”   No but seriously, where I’m from you have like 8  different sides with food xD wth
I'm ready for you guys to cook for me...
It was a good pun.
I love how Ned just had to put fried chicken and damn did that fried chicken look good 🤤 I’m crazy hungry now 😂
#1 Pun "Nacho Zach" #2 Pun "Peared them"  Well done boys as always. Congratulations Keith!
I literally say the same thing about cast iron skillets lol
I'm so annoyed by Zach's constant complaining on every video. He acts like he's the only one doing the challenge.
they should create a cookbook of all their recipes from their episodes
11:22 iconic by the one and only, Eugene
Zach DID NOT just "open" a mango like that. 😑
Eugene is that one kid that doesn't even study but still gets an A+ on the test
This new show is so positive. Gimme some crazy. Cmoonnn
are there even Kroger in California?
i have been a try guy fan for awhile and i’ve grown to have a crush on zack
zachs box is uper unfairr
Ooo
I need to see a video of Zach doing a pan-Asian geography test. 😂
I almost forgot Eugene was gay, that man and that beard is doing it for me!!
Low key, an easy Top Ten Try Guys video. Just pleasant from start to finish.
Keith blowing that kiss was just the cutest thing I've seen today... 😍
I need more of this.  I'd also love a "cook from what's in the pantry" challenge.
Me thinking: WHAT?!!! There is a Try Guys cooking video I've never seen before? ...Then realizing at the end that it was released today LMAOO
THE TRY GUYS SWAP THEIR DIETS FOR A DAY!!
Zack’s ingredients could’ve made a nice coconut curry if he was talented lol
Keith Won!!!!!!!! 😊
Are there Attemptabelles? I'd watch that too
So you're telling me that Zach doesn't know how to open a mango.
I love that the only good thing they can say about Kroger is that they “highlight in season foods”
Eugene: f is for- Me: friends who do stuff together Eugene and Zach: fuUuUuuUUUuunnnnn Me: oh
"I really show up when the stakes are low" gotta love zack
Something about the sugar coconut water that zack made just really tickles the ol funny bone
Reader, the pun was indeed appreciated.
Everything looked delicious!! Great job everyone!!
Eugene's beard  EUGENE'S BEARD  *EUGENE'S BEARD*
kinda wish Keith had just given Ned a bottle of each of his sauces with like one bit of meet and one leaf of lettuce
Zach with oily hands and a chef’s knife should go well...
Came to this video to be entertained, left entertained AND with a self defence tip from Keith 🙌
Ned: “Is a cast iron skillet a weapon?” Me: “Ask Rapunzel”
Nick is such an interesting guy. From the game Who's the best boss & this, seems like he's gotten into soooo much random interesting work.
So great seeing you all together!
Watching Zach opening a mango gave me great physical pain😂😂😂 SOMEONE HELP HIM
When the guys cook, Nick being a food critic becomes their biggest flex. It's like "we know what we're doing. We got a professional!"
If sortedfood was made by a group of ethnically diverse american youtube chads Edit: I'm also pretty sure none of them are chefs
I love the wholesomeness in this video you guys are so sweet
Umm that’s not gnocchi
Me a South Asian, watching the coconut getting violated 👀
i lowkey feel like the tryguys are some of the luckiest people ever. They get to do so much cool, creative, genuinely FUN looking stuff and its all for their work
I’d love to see a without a recipe where there is a twist. That twist is... drumroll please... they switch their food halfway through and have to finish it as their own. Let them see this
They are so tender to one another and it truly makes me so happy
Reminds me of a Top Chef Quickfire.
Check out Seana Momsen's YouTube channel!   She is a transgender youtuber who celebrates body positivity and embraces the concept of self-love.
I love the Nachos Zach pun!
Their cooking skills have evolved so much haha
"Sizzle my name! Sizzle me daddy!" My motto 2021
*SIZZLE ME DADDY*
A IS FOR ANKLES
Eugene has done it again!
Watching Zack rip up that mango made me queezy
“This is a very positive show, so let’s get to 4th place.” Lol love Nick
Thumbs up for the content; thumbs down for Kroger
Sorry, but the hilariousness of Kroger sponsoring them when Kroger stores don't exist in Los Angeles is killing me. Ralph's and Food 4 Less are owned by Kroger though, if y'all live in SoCal wanna appreciate the sponsorship hustle.
Zach just throwing the coconut on the ground was *chefs kiss*
Is it just me or is Eugene getting much nicer and sweeter then before. Now he looks like he actually cares about the other guys. And he would probably be happy to sit in Keith's lap.
Stop with thumbnail faces please lol
"This is an our planet vegetable?"  We need more vegetables like that.
They all did so well, WOW!!!
Zach: *desperately trying to combine his ingredients* Eugene: F is for friends who do stuff together U is for you and meeeeee
I feel zach was slighted on this. Ned should have been last since the main thing liked about his dish wasn't part of his box. Zach had compliments on every item from his box and definitely had the hardest ingredients. Keith's ingredients were by far the easiest to make a good dish out of. Zach deserved second place at least.
There are a lot of morbid jokes in this episode! XD Like, not even a lot for an ad but a lot for most Try Guys videos. Do The Guys cope with "family friendly content" by talking about death and pain? lol Also... 14:13-14:16
The knife sounds when listing the ingredients are so cringe lol (also love the video!)
Keith looks cute in this episode😊🤭
This vid had a weird vibe
Medic! Chopped! Try Guys Style
Ned and Keith-actually trying  to make something edible  Zach and Eugene-*chaos*
If you have a cast iron pan in your house, is it still a weapon if you can’t lift it?
These videos are my favorite!
I really hope they're all vaccinated.
"Mashed pastatos" is hurting me. Gnocchi is Potato Pasta lmao
yess am so exited
Could have name it "zaach-o", but whatever
I am here to read comments about Eugene's beard
"really go cut yourself, and I'll kiss it" - Eugene lmao
Cast iron skillet weapon TANGLED!!!
Eugene too 🔥
This is my favorite video of the try guys I've seen in a while. It feels very genuine and fun :)
I I can’t stop pressing skip every time Zach is on screen
These cooking videos are just stellar
NED IS SO BLAND AS A BOILED CHICKEN WING
The over the top krogger placements/shouts is too much. It is really off putting
Kieth calling the marinara Kompot All the slavs: Noooooooooo
Keith made a semi decent traditional Ukranian salad xD
You guys should have Roman pick out clothing items for you to recreate and judge!
Missed opportunity for Eugene to say "A is for ankles" 🤣
Can you do Try Guys Try Not To Cry Challenge with the Try Wives please?
I'm loving all the graphics used here! Honestly better than some TV shows
Zach literally went haywire the entire time but still ended up making something not only edible but also pretty good... appluad.
I love how excited Keith looks while he is waiting for everyone to react
This makes me wish their was a Chopped special where its the just the 4 guys competing. It would be amazing.
I need Zach's skincare routine, he's GLOWING
Okay but on a serious note, my mom was going through DV situation and hit my ex-stepdad in the head with an iron cast skillet and saved her life!!!!! So yes, iron cast skillet, totally a weapon!!!!!!!
Compotes are cooked. You made a salsa
“There are knives on the floor!”
Your videos become even more and more chaotic 😳 love the vibes keep it up
Damned if you all didn't just give me solid ideas for next week's dinner menu. Thanks, Try Guys!
Honestly in most try guys episodes Zach wins that. They just did really good in this one.
Eugene with beard makes me think a lot about myself...
Lost my mind when Zach brought up Khaleesi mother of dragons
Growing up had cheese sauce on asparagus (and cauliflower and broccoli). Not weird.
We please need "Asian of Chaos" merch, thank you!
please tell me someone else knows that the type of pasta Keith used isn't gnocchi but conchiglie (shells).
Try guys are becoming chef's May be they can invent a new dish someday
Zach?? struggling?? to?? open?? a?? mango?? *OKAY*
i love that pun  -my cat, kedi
"nachos zach"
Eugene I’m sorry but that mustache and beard look out of place
Omg Eugene is much more confident compared to your first videos. It's very inspiring and I'm happy for him!
Fun fact: mashed rutabaga is a delicious holiday potato alternative. They just take a little more pre-cook maintenance than a couple of potatoes.
I didn't realize that eugene losing would make me so sad...
I actually want to eat Zach's meal for once.
Nacho Zach... why not Zacho?
EUGENE HAS A BEARD NOW!?
South Asia like India 😂😂
Eugene: go cut yourself and when I see some blood then I'll kiss it Zach: 'walks away with knife' oKkkKkk
Nick is SUPER overqualified, that man should have his own show, and he also looks like he does woodwork on the side. 😂 (Wont be surprised if he does)
"boo boo"
neds laugh sounds like squidward
I LOVE THISSS
They should really do a Chopped styled video where they make different dishes but HAVE to include the weird ingredient. Honestly, just wanna watch the try guys on chopped 😂
Nick is my ultimate crush at the Try Team, but in this video he just crushed my heart without mercy
Yay! Nick's in this video
I want them to put out recipes for all of these! They all look so good
We use an iron skillet for everything at my grandma house. Frying bacon, making popcorn, putting it in the oven and roasting pumpkin seeds. Iron skillets are life highkey
Zack the vegan king!!
So weird seeing my hometown grocery store sponsoring one of my favourite channels.
I love how everyone accidentally made good food
Yeah it makes sense that Ned is the Richard Blais
How do you guys determine the matchups? Is it a random hat draw or just the pair that you think would be most entertaining?
Very lame of the try guys to work with Kroger right now considering they’re a soulless corporation that just closed THREE stores in LA to avoid paying their employees hazard pay. Workers are literally protesting Kroger right now and the try guys are giving them good promo. It’s hard to believe that the try guys are really as progressive as they claim when they make these kinds of sponsorship agreements.
I lost it when Eugene called Zach a good lady 🤣
Zach is so fucking sexyyyyy , do a southern accent more often
You guys should do a "Without a Recipe Pretzel "
Keith runs off set to wash his hands *sink right behind him* (there's probably a reason but it still made me laugh) lol
Yay another win for Keith!
I have no idea if anyone else noticed this but Ned’s dish resembles Gotcha Pork Roast from Food Wars... This whole thing resembles Food Wars!
nick is cute
I thought that this was a re-upload. Does anyone? Or it's just me?
Sizzle me daddy - Zach
Zach struggling to open his ingredients was probably the best part of the video
Ima need a restock on the merch prontodente
I'd bleed for a kiss from Eugene.
I really enjoyed that, Going to watch it again with my wife later.
"South Asian like Indian??" Eugene cracks me up every time :)
Keith's face when the judges were complimenting Zach's dish is the best part of this video
I feel like zack should have just toasted the bread, would have added some nice crunchy chrunch
The production and editing on this video is * chefs kiss *
Maybe Zach could have toasted the bread for the sandwich! Then it would be perfect 👌
I hate the word “stripies” - you’re a grown man Zach say strips
Someone cheers Nick 🥺 17:26
I want to see them do Beat a Professional Chef but Chopped Style. 3 (or 4) of them vs 1 professional Chopped champion. Judges blind taste everything. 3 rounds to the winner.
I like watching you guys bc you seem unproblematic 🥰
Eugene - I'd make a great killer. * Kills us with his looks every video *
Perfect opportunity for Ned/Keith to plug Keith's chicken sauce wasted
Eugene created white people taco night.....
zach making a good dish out of those ingredients WHO ARE YOU?
Kroger..really? :/
"I'd make a great killer" 🤣
Seeing Zack just rip open the mango made me feral
Is Eugene trying to be Zach's best friend? Love their energy  ❤
“If you don’t think you have a weapon in your house, and you have a cast iron, you have a weapon”  Or yaknow, a kitchen knife. Stab someone with a fork. Take bug spray and a lighter and make a flamethrower. Baseball bat. Hit someone over the head with a bottle of wine
Do they know that gnocchi are made of potatoes??
“They all exceeded our expectations.” THE GROWTH THERE THOUGH. It’s such a journey from Without a Recipe: Bread to here.
Wtf zack my heart dropped when you open that mango. Lmao
That pun was perfect,
Extra credit to Zack because he could have easily killed himself or someone else today
Okay so this was a really great video.
Congrats, Keith! Your dish looked delicious!
11:17 cute
Is it just me, or is Eugene in the videos "off"? Like, quite different behaving? Other than that, this video was super fun, the concept is cool, love you guys!
It's so cute but hilarious how whenever the guys are making/doing something for EACHOTHER, it actually turns out really nice
Eugenes beard is giving me Andrew Deluca vibes
Ok first of all Ned should have made those grapes into grape jelly. And glazed the pork with it.  But I’m so happy Keith got this one! Mostly for that kiss in the end! This is officially a thirst comment for Keith.
Both zach and eugene are chaotic. Zach is pure uncontroled chaos, while eugen has more practice directing his chaotic energy
I really want recipes for all of these not gonna lie
Brought to you by Kroger, the company that opted to close all their stores rather than pay their employees hazard pay.  You support war mongering politicians, so this should come as no surprise  👎
I love how far Zach has come. He went from giving the judges almost food poisoning to something that actually tastes decent.
They should do Meatloaf without a recipe, I'd love to see how Eugene adds alcohol to that lol
if you have a food network contract could you theoretically go on chopped
More ikea without instructions!
Zach is so cute :( my sweet lil baby korn
Does Zach know anything about Asia? The last time he classified his dumplings (with Shezuan Peppers and Kimich) as Japanese and now calls all these ingredients South Asian
10:07 feral ned has entered the chat
Hi Ry Trys lol
Zach: "I have some fears".... Me: What else is new about that? LOL  also Eugene: "I make a great killer" LOL silent killer
Zach: *yeets a coconut* Zach, hacker voice: _Im in_
the fact that they can make good dishes out of random stuff but bad dishes when they are given the actual ingredients
How did they all do so well? None of the meals were ruined holy crap!
This is the only channel where I can watch half hour videos completely through and not complain about the length one time
Omg that kiss that Keith blew at the end - he's really leaning into his (BTS) Jin-ness lol
"I'd make a great.... killer" obliterated me. NBC has a new Hannibal if Mads Mikkelson ever retires
The Try Guys need to come out with a cookbook from their successes.
This should just be a food channel.  80% of the content revolves around food.    Can't wait for them to go back to actually trying things.
Zach: i think i got a boo-boo Eugene: is it bleeding? Zach: not yet Eugene: well it doesn't get a kiss  ....a few moments later Eugene: so go really cut yourself and then I'll kiss it Zach leaves
The words ‘Meat bath’ makes me feel sick
What would it take to get the Try Guys on Nailed It?
What the hell kinda gnocchi was that? It's not supposed to be a dried noodle like actual pasta. They are dumplings that usually are made with potato as an ingredient. Real gnocchi probably would have been paired just fine with potatoes as a double starch. No need to mash.
“chicken has a way of doing that” lmfao okay keith
Well Eugene finally said what we were all thinking lol 10:18
I love the Try Guys.  I’m so glad Keith won!!!
Zach would be disowned in an Asian family for using metal on a nonstick pan. Forks and nonstick? Abomination!
beets are a misunderstood vegetable
Eugene :also big letters This tells us how much he loves big things😉
Heckin chefs
Zach....have you never seen someone cut a mango..? Surprise surprise boo you just cut it 😂😂😂😂  definitely no weird tearing that you did omg hahahhahaha
I didn't know Eugene had enough testosterone to produce facial hair.
Lmao at the ending
Eugene just looks 10,000 funnier with a mustache
Ned's dish was SO beautiful, i'm impressed!!!
Bring back Dexter with Eugene as the Star and it would be a hit show.  Keith and Ned : food network level Zach and Eugene: chaos.
Eugene facial hair fire
ned and keith slowly getting more and more panicked vs eugene just doing whatever tf he wants and zach struggling to open any of his ingredients
nobody: literally nobody: keith: now, that was a waste of grapes, but, it was also a waste of time
Zack: I have a boo boo Eugene: go really cut yourself and then I’ll kiss it  😂😂😂😂 Eugene is going to be a great dad
Me sittin here vibin with my Kroger Covid vaccine bandaid:)
Every time Nick’s on a video we hear a new nugget of awesome information about him and I’m here for it 🙌
fun fact: juicy fruit gum is flavored to taste like Jackfruit
they all complimented each other so much!! everything looked great!!
LOVE YOUR COOKING VIDEOS SO MUCH!! PLEASE MAKE MORE!!!
Fried chicken
i loved that pun :)
LOVE THIS SO MUCH <333
zach going "i made a eugene food!" w/ the asian food and bbq was just the most adorable thing ever.
Who else can't wait for the taekwondo video? 🤚
Bruhh whoo edited this?? Give them a raise
Jackfruit is the tastiest when its ripe
I’m actually early for somethin
i freakin love kroger
=D love you guys
.
For anyone in LA that doesn't know, Ralph's is a Kroger store (same company but the storefront just has another name). Kroger store names vary with what region they are in. Kroger also opted to close some stores in California instead of paying their employees hazard pay during the pandemic and are known for treating their employees terribly (can confirm as a former Kroger employee who quit because of the awful treatment) so it is disappointing to me that the Try Guys are supporting them.
The judging is too nice... Kroger demanded they not say anything remotely bad about their food, huh?
Eugene: hates hugs Also Eugene:11:30
Eugene had Zach's ingredients and for fourth place (where Zach usually is). Hmm.
Yo their cooking is wonderful
try guys cooking content >>>>>>>>>>>>
LOL jackfruit is the national fruit in our country
Zach:kiss it Eugene: is it bleeding Z: no E: it doesn't get a kiss if it isn't bleeding Z: goes to cut himself for eugenes kiss
Hey you know what you should do you should have them cook from a recipe that is partially blacked out so like —————— cups of chicken broth
Damn Keith!! Congrats
"We can say that now, because we're food network stars, :)" "We are we got a contract :D" IM SO PROUD OF THEM STILL
28:43 best moment ever Edit: I'm back after 11 months and I agree
omg I'm the 666th comment lol
what even is this
I love that a white guy is trying to figure out what to do with jackfruit. It's actually pretty hilarious 😂
Ned: "I personally love Kroger stores because by highlighting the seasons freshest ingredients it makes it easy for me to plan my meals around what's fresh and what's happening"  YESS NED GET THAT SPONSORSHIP MONEY!!! YESSSS
I loved the murderous part at 10:10 from ned killing to eugene😂😂
Zach needs to go to jail for the way he opened that mango
I’m so happy to see them in the kitchen, it feels so much better
This was so fun! And the tv show graphics were way better done than they had any right to be
Zach is WILD to watch cook.
Masterchef but make it Try Guys
It was the best of puns, it was the worst of puns.  It was great.  I'd give that much dedication to a pun . Eugene is too good for this world
I am so proud of their constant improvement & innovation!
Ned is really feeling himself as a judge
i sometimes forget how many talented people work at 2nd try. out if nowhere we’ll learn some random new skill someone from the team has, like nick is ALSO a food critic??? insane
eugene looks like he could be asian gigachad
I'm so confused about what kind of gnocchi looks like pasta shells, I've only ever seen them as the little potato pasta oval balls
Tfw you go into this expecting the most random food combos, but since its sponsored by a food company its not much of a random box but "here's some legit ingredients because meh"
Can we get on episode of chopped with the try guys
try to do spring roll without a recipe
Zach: *points at smoke* smoke
This is the best Zach has ever looked. Well done.
What crazy person cooks full carrots
Keith cooks like married man with his live together and im loving it
You know what they actually all did pretty well. Zach definitely impressed me lollll that he didn’t fail
I like how Without a Recipe started as their Great British Bake Off but this overwhelmingly positive show is what has really captured GBBO’s vibe.
try guys cooking videos are literally always the best
Keith has never been sexier than when he's talking about cast iron skillets as a weapon.
I dont know which of the editors on the team did the ingredient titles but they looked so good. like a food show murder mystery.
honestly shout out to this production team, the amount of camera work and editing put into this is insane! everyone at 2nd try is so talented man
9:56 Tangled taught us that
Beautiful Keith cooking a beautiful meal and ends it with a beautiful kiss, just ugh 💕
The Jack fruit is ripe not good for savory dish...
As usual, Eugene goes all out being vicious with his own colleague....
oh snap...eugene placing 4th....whatttttt
Give yourself more time to cook some stuff takes longer to do
Why Eugene? Zachary can make brownies why are you not wanting him to get a second win?😂
Sooooo how many cooking shows does it take to make a cookbook?
9:14 is me when I’m doing my homework
from the first ep of without the recipe, they're getting better and better. one day they will be in MasterChef
White ppl use alot of vinegar huh 😲
Why do Americans pronounce herb as ‘erb’. It has a h in it.
All I’m gonna. Say is Keith u need to grow a beard.
The music is reminding me of Pirates of the Caribbean. Is that just me, or?
Good job guys 🥳
I have a very serious question: can @nedfullmer 's parents PLEASE write a book on how to raise a perfect well-adjusted child?? Fr.
i liked that pun Eugene!!
I'm too hungry to be watching this
Eugene is smiling a lot in this video and my brain was confused.
It’s so cool to see Zack improving 🥰
A is for ankles!!
Eugene: Seductively scrapes tomatoes into a bowl. Me: Ah yes, of course. Yes. Eugene: Talks about murder. Me: Perfect:-D
They need to make a series like without a recipe where it’s like chopped and they can make whatever they want
As a Kroger employee, this one gave me some real mixed feelings
Nest guest judge: Gordon Ramsay let’s make it happen
Yes try guys make that bank
If I were judging this on presentation they would all receive high marks  Zach: Simplistic but effective 9/10 Eugene: The pun was there and still beautifully presented 10/10 Keith: Like a home-cooked meal but more appetising 9/10 Ned: Restaurant quality meal 10/10
Never had cheese on asparagus???? Parmesan crusted asparagus is like my favorite recipe ever
watching Zach rip open the mango that way hurt my soul
The results surprised the hell of of me 🤣
A letter to Zack, Eugene did not give you hard ingredients you’re just white
I love how Zach just reinforces that white people dont season their cooking 🤣
Asian of Chaos has returned
This brings me back to Ready Steady Cook days :')
I really appreciate how entertaining you all make your shows. Your friendship really shows. I'm just sad you all took a sponser from Kroger especially after Kroger's response to citys that passed hazard pay requirements for large corporations was to close stores and layoff workers.
Thank you for including the extra special ingredient -- NICK! Love him so much!
Try guy video idea: truth or drink
26:01: TRY GUYS COOKBOOK!!!
Keith looks extra handsome this episode..... Maybe it's the apron, maybe it's the hair... I'll never know
can we get nick and alex as a permanent judge in these videos? their presence is deeply appreciated :)
Why are these better when the judges struggle to eat the food?
i will gladly accept keith as the new and improved julia child. amen.
Now we need “sizzle me, daddy” merch.
That pun was amazing 😂
Ainsley Harriet is quaking
Zach’s candied coconut thingy is actually an actual type of filling in many thai desserts.
They should do one of these but with the try wives(and boyfriend) cooking!
I'm sorry, that clip at the end fucking killed me.
They have all gotten so much better at cooking over the years with all these videos.
Nooo Ned should have won
“Oh sizzle my name daddy!” Me: yes food but daddy’s favorite
they've come so far since their first without a recipe :')
29:40 THE BEST BIT PLEASEE LMABFBBGFFLD
Eugene's beard places 5th
Keith spittin grapes at his cats has me crying 😭😂
Wolfgang Ned for the win
Excuse me but how did they make everything so perfect??
Zack dancing while thinking about what to with his food is a mood
I loved that pun.
I love how they have all become really good cooks!  And they enjoy it!
"I'd make a GREAT killer" -Eugene, 2021
30:06 ned: *awkward-I-don't-know-you-we're-just-acquaintances-side eye*
“I don’t know how to open a mango” 😂😂
oh, Kroger, the guys that don't want to pay 2 additional bucks to their staff and instead close up the stores.... fuck them ^^
Love the video
*looks at zack & the jackfruit. Laughs in Jamaican*
Love the editing
Eugene's third hand @6:38!!
Love watching this while eating the most simple 3 ingredient meal
For any UK viewers, theres a show called "ready steady cook" which has the same premise but with professional chefs, its a really good show so if you like this then give it a go
"Chaos will reign." 😆
Keith's face when he found out Zach didn't season anything 😂
Kroger has its priorities set right
The editing is god tier
Keith it’s rude to spit on cats man 😂😂😂😂😂
I think Ned should have won.
“The winner of this mystery box is...” me, chanting: KEITH KEITH KEITH KEITH  “Keith!” me, crying: YYEEEEAAAHHHHHH  update: he bLEW a KiSS at mE?????? i’m???? sWOOn???
I’m so proud of how much they have all improved in the kitchen. Real chefs 😌
Zach: "What are those?" Eugene: "Nacho-Zach"  Ladies and gentlemen he stuck the landing! Give it up for Eugene Lee Yang 👏👏👏👏
This was a really fun episode! You guys should do more.
Zach
Keith
We need to see a chef react to this. Imagine Gordon Ramsay watching this chaos 🤣
Eugene
As being an experienced Jackfruit cutter Zach was good for a beginner  The mango was horrendously opened
Ned
I didn’t know Eugene was a doctor who fan!!!! That’s so awesome!!! 😊
26:48 Keith's reaction 😂😂😂😂 and Keith's win is so refreshing!
I love this I’m glad all of you guys did well. You guys are improving on your cooking skills too this is great.
Love you too Keith 😘
*”i think this is a very positive show... so let’s go to fourth place”*  😂😂😂
Congrats Mr winner! (no spoiler for scrollers)
26:47 polite nodding turns to mega-incredulous side eye xDDD
That is a turnip... wth is a rutabaga?! 💀
I need a "chaos will reign" gif
Nick is a food critic!! we need him in the without recipe videos
Zach opening the mango gave me an aneurysm
I feel like Zach would have ranked a lot higher if he toasted the bread
11:19 *awww.*
Eugene is getting sexier day by day, he looks 🔥 hot
... why is that pasta called gnocchi? -an honesly confused Italian.
"We're the Try Guys, we love you!" *kisses*  This should be the new outro for every video from now on.
Why are the Try Guys so amazing!?!!?!!
512th comment
That reaction when eugene lost!😆
eugene is too cute istg it's killing me
I couldn't stop screaming "Fingers! Fingers!" When Zack was opening that jackfruit
That’s a borderline ripe jackfruit😔 It should be white not a hint of yellow
So that's how people cook if they don't have to clean up afterwards... Looks like it's fun :)
I’m starving now. Thanks a lot.
What is a compote?
I have watched every Try Guys video at this point
The jackfruit seed has a casing and judging by the *crunch*, Zach didn't remove it! Roasted seeds are really good, though, kinda nutty. We also boil them with a bit of salt and eat it as is. :)
I want more mystery box style videos
Used to work for kroger. They're horrible to their employees and it always bums me out when you guys are sponsored by them. If you need examples r/Kroger on reddit is a very good place to see what the employees think about the chain as a whole.
Ned!!! Why didn’t u use the cauliflower to make faux chicken wings?!
Eugene got 4th because he layered them on top of each other? how would you make nachos?
4 chaotic energy masses make 4 tasty dishes, representing the 4 cardinal points of USA
Those are not Gnocchi. I'm so confused.
.... is Eugene unwell? He didn’t use any alcohol....
Zach using metal forks on a nonstick pan killed me inside.... Also, Eugene was wicked for giving Zach the foods he did😂😂 the two of them are a mess together
When y’all made sauerkraut at home growing up was it sweet or salty/sour?
Thanks for being a positive bright spot in my Saturday morning. 💖
Omg zach did so well this time
Ned's dish can absolutely be served in an upscale restaurant.
Damn this was a whole ass production. Love.
Zach: *(not knowing how to cut all the fruits)*  Me: *(while eating a mango)* ZACH WDYM
I wish Eugene had kissed Zach's bubu But he did spell his name with food, so yeah that's love
Can we get a try guys cookbook of all the 1st place dishes 🤔
It would be hilarious if someone included a can of Surströmming for a laugh!
So excited for this 😃
I really hope one day, the try guys come to India 😭
The Try Guys' judges should be named The Try Guts.
Eugene recipe is so beautiful!! Is surprisingly delicious looking
All the Asians wacthing: * sigh *
all the try guys making food that actually tastes good within an hour, in the same episode is the type of character development we all love to see.
feeling really sick so needed this video to cheer me up, thanks guys :)
I love starting my weekend with my Husband waking up with our coffee and laughing our asses off!! Thank you so much for making a difference in our life and adding so much joy! My favorite part, Eugene saying “that’s the outro?”
Beautiful Keith, and the rest.
i dont know what it is but at 11:36 when ned is calmy explaining what he's about to do and keith with the ferocity of a thousand suns just yells "oh BOY"
I held my breathe for a majority of the taste tests, since I'm so used to at least one person nearly poisoning the judges, lol. This video actually made me hungry, lol!
I don't like how kroger is putting so much money into advertising but closed  5 stores and fired the people who worked for them because they didn't want to pay more money for essential workers
Good job guys very proud of you guys work!!!
Zach: You are a GOD DAMN Wizard.  You had no plan, you blindly executed and it's good. That's just Eugene!
I’m just waiting for December when they call up courage to be a judge
the mexican in me cringed when Zach opened the mango like that 😬
Mystery Desserts Next !!!!🙌🏼
Loved this one!!!
Zach are you okay?
Watching Zach and that knife had me very concerned!
Every Channel is a Food/Cooking Channel these days....which is just great for me.
Alexandria: Zach, nothing was seasoned but it was delicious Keith *visibly confused*
the return of 4 guys screaming in a kitchen💙
I can't wait until the Try Guys inevitably release a cook book
My soul is screaming at Zach and those forks on that pan
The way Zach opened that mango made me wanna cry 🥲
The editing tho😂
To the Food Network Exec watching this after telling the Try Guys to make a video where they don't go absolutely nuts and keep the content to a level they could show on TV... They did it. The show is a go. Let's do this.
That green tile. Repurposed from an abandoned, 1960’s Moldovan kitchen.
real friendship right here 11:25
Lmao Zach "I made Eugene!“
Try Guys Cooking Styles:  Ned: Dignified Zach: Clumsy Keith: Messy  Eugene: Serial Killer 😏🔪
the way we don't even have Krogers in LA lmao
I love how all the results are significantly better than what ever comes from without a recipe
I’m seriously impressed at the heighten skill level the more they all cook! Every single on of those dishes looked delicious when it came together.
i love the "sheer utter chaos" vibes of without a recipe vs the "its pretty good, actually" vibes of mystery box
How bout trying to cook a 3 course meal?
I would've loved to help Zack with the jackfruit and the coconut 🥺
I wanna eat ZACH's A.
Next time when stuck on what to do with the beets, put some olivr oil on it, some lemon or lime juice, a bit of salt and it can serve as a salad. Tastes amazing as well.
nothing activates my monkey chip like try guys + food in a video
Everyone should definitely try to grow out a beard.
Zack. You should have toasted your bread my guy
Eugene looking for the alcohol:  *sweats*   *where is it?*
Eugene: "Go over there and cut yourself and I'll kiss it" Zach: "Okay" *Grabs knife and walks away*  BABYKORN NO! That is unsafe sir!
I am living for Eugene in a beard
Is pastatoes not just gnocci???
Keith: this was made on EARTH?
Love the intro head thing
WHAT IF: mystery box challenge but there IS A RECIPE IN MIND. Im talking fancyish food and all the ingredients and portions but NO RECIPE AND NO INFORMATION. Bonus points if what they end up making is somehow actually the same dish that the mystery maker had in mind.
I love that Eugene put down his meal and slid two lactose pills to Zach and Alexandria.
Lmao tortilla chips are made from corn tortillas not flour... cmon Eugene you should know this being from Texas.
I like how he talked about roster jackfruit seeds but they are poisonous
Ah, Kroger, the corporation that closed two stores in Long Beach, Calif., after that city passed an ordinance requiring grocery stores with more than 300 employees to pay an additional $4 an hour due to the pandemic 😑
Keith that is a waste of grapes bro
I was sad this helped
Zach is such a sore loser.
Nobody:  Me facing any minor inconvenience: 9:14
IM EARLY
Eugene, that was a good joke.
Zach opening that mango physically hurt me
This mystery box stuff really makes me think you guys should collab with Sortedfood at some point. They have done a lot of mystery box stuff and it's great.
I felt so bad for Zach in this one lmao
Zach fighting for it is so Zach
Eugene "I would make a good killer" Yang
I'm going to need a Try Guys Cookbook :)
Eugen is always soooo creative with his work..wather its cooking or something else..love his dish
Me watching Zach approach the coconut while holding the knife like a dagger: NOT LIKE THAT!
I hope the guys' next book is going to be a compilation of all these recipes
i wonder what would be different if zach actually seasoned his dish (and well too)
Yo
why’d they all pop off so hard damn
I adore these food videos
Eugene always looks good, but Eugene with a beard....damn.
I think eugene is not someone with cooking skills up his sleeves but he is extermely creative so even if the dish might not be th best tasting its always so creative that you just can't help but appreciate the efforts and he does it so effortlessly
Eugene unlocked some memories with that Allons-y
Eugene: Chaos will reign.  Me: I've always knew Eugene would be a Balls of Chaos fan.
This is like Chopped but more stuff in the box 😂
Zach's hilarious. 😂 15:56
Oh so Kroger doesn’t have money for hero pay in LBC, but they have enough money to pay these guys
So confused about what is called "gnocchi" here. That's not gnocchi at all 😱
keith is jin from bts. now if you know bts you will know this is a verrryyy verrry amajin complement, and that blowing kiss, and those eating shows, keith is jin. mr. world wide handsome man
So this is a less professional version of Chopped....perfect!!!
Zach didn't fuck up, the character development, I'm so proud 😭
My insides shuddered when Zach ripped the mango open with his hands
I really wanna see all 4 Try Guys work together to cook a mystery box meal by the Try Crew for the Try Crew
The faces Zach and Keith make are just sooo cute
I thought Zach was going to win
Awesome video!
cooking video where everyone actually succeeded 😂😂😂
Anyone know what their food network show is called?
they all succeeded omg
5:08 Facts!!
I had to pause the video to complain about Zach tearing the mango with his hands. Why Zach? Why?
I think we can all agree if the try guys went on an episode of nailed it, it would be all the chaos we need and want to get through the end of this pandemic
9:53 Rapunzel!
This video is mystery box and without a recipe. My two favourite videos/series. Perfect
I don’t remember this episode of Chopped
THE LAST CLIP OF KIETH IS LOWKEY THE BEST PART OF THE VIDEO 😂💀 IM DEADDD
Eugenes latka phase again hehe
As an Asian watching Zach try opening his ingredients is very entertaining
People eat too much salt....they dont know flavor unless salty AF. Salt is why so much problems... low sodium diet a common thing now forced into life because usa over does salt... so food critics reliance on salt flavor tells me they actually cant taste food well....
Is this the new kitchen!
this was so much fun to watch!! you can see their personalities through their cooking
Eugene: I'd be a great killer.
allons y?
Eugene and Zach did comfort food and then Keith and Ned went fancy
Ivan very confused by the mashed pastatoes. Gnocchi is just potatoes dumplings, but it looks like he threw pasta shells in there? I’m confuzzled.
Omg Zack! Watch out with knives!
They've come so far, cooking-wise.
Eugene usually does well because he has an artistic eye. He knows what to do without really thinking much of it. He might not even realize
YES ive been hoping for one of these
7:16 When Eugene cut out a 'k' then asks Zach how he spells his name 😂😂😂
I really appreciate the good vibes here, everybody absolutely nailed it but more than that they’re all just having a great time and building each other up. Perfect stuff
LOVED this! More of this please and thanks
im sorry zach but the way you try to cook hurts my soul, still love you tho
2021 looking good for chef zach.
Zach! PLEASE don't use metal on your pans like that 😳 omg
Everything is a weapon Keith, even a hair tie or a pencil or a plate. You just need skills
I knew it! Eugene is too perfect to be human. HE IS A VAMPIRE
Its so strange that they found potatoes and pasta weird together, in Hungary thats an actual dish 😂
A cast iron skillet was literally used as a weapon in the Disney movie "Tangled"....of course it's a great weapon 😂😂😂😂
eugene and zach's friendship is EVERYTHING
❤Eugene as Dexter is what my Dreams are made of
I love you too guys! Especially you, Zach 💕
That outro was perfection
I love all the mystery box challenges
A food critic too? Nick has like 183 lives
18:47 i'm already excited for this dish but this shot looks rlly nice
I think my favorite part was 00:21 Sharpie > Sticker
Did my eyes just see double fork shredding in the non stick pan?!
As an Asian, the lack of carbohydrates in their meals just sends me into a culture shock. Meals here are 60% rice or noodles
love alexandria and nick as judges in this episode !!! ♡
Watching Zach cut open a mango like that almost killed my Indian ass. That was painful to watch
i would’ve made sujebi and some sort of dessert with Zack’s ingredients😭
I would have done enchiladas with Eugenes dish and just filled it with the ingredients
SPOILER:                                         I’m right Keith won
u know in zach just toasted the bread it would have been perfect
Man their partners must all be fed super well since they’re all pretty good cooks
Damn I'm so proud of all the guys Each and everyone of their dishes were amazing each deserve a first place ❤️❤️❤️
keith says something about spitting grapes at cats in the outro ... please don't do this. cats are sensitive to aggression AND GRAPES ARE TOXIC TO CATS AND DOGS ... raisins are more toxic. Something about how it interacts with their red blood cells. Just be nice to your pets. If they act out, verbally correct them and maybe add in timeouts. Use noise or splashes of water to interrupt fights ... otherwise, be gentle with them. they are social learners. dogs live in packs, cats in colonies ... they learn from us and our actions affect them.
I wanna see the food babies and miles do this challenge with the try guys giving them the ingredients!
Eugene: I'd make a great killer The most relatable Try Guy
This is how you make interesting sponsored content 😌
Keith’s cat story at the end 🤣🤣🤣  diabolical
Anyone else wondering why Zack was standing when he was trying to cut eugene food? Just why😅
Keith giving Ned a red plate is so wholesome
Make try guys apron!!!!
17:23 Aww, give Nick's candied coconut water a toast too 😭 But for real, all of these dishes made me so hungry lol, everything looks so yummy!
yall is durian kimchi a thing?
moment of silence to appreciate Eugene's facial hair
WHY ARE WE NOT TALKING ABOUT "So really go cut yourself and I'll kiss it"
I'm just so surprised everything was edible-
Eugene: I'd make a great killer.. LOL
another thing eugene could be great at: being a killer
I for sure thought Ned would’ve won
Cast iron skillet as a weapon? Tangled anyone? 😏🤣
4:43 CHAOS REIIIIGNS!...Black Friday anyone?
Normally, we just write this in Sharpe. 😂😂😂 Level up.
Eugene and Zach in the greatest culinary Sweeney Todd reboot ever.
I LOVE the cooking series. The best!
Now im gonna make neds dish at home
i love the try guys
Somebody get me an "id make a great killer" gif 😭
no one gets a kiss unless ur bleeding
Loving the fact that Zach turns out for a win when nothing it on the line. Especially with cooking.
Zach: i think i got a booboo. can you kiss it?  Eugene: Is it bleeding? zach: Not yet. eugene: well, it doesnt get a kiss zach: so you'd rather kiss the blood? eugene: well, yeah. cuz that means you are in pain. so go ahead and cut yourself Zach: Uhhh. OKAYYY heheheheeh  Gosh these two ahahahahah
sooooooo the sink behind you guys was not working? :D
Eugene after being friends with Zach for several years: "Zach how do you spell your name again?" *holds up a 'K'*  😂😂😂
What is Zach doing with that mango 🥭? 😂   Also, yeah for the coconut 🥥 you can always resort to throwing it on the ground 😂 been there done that. 😂
Zach is the whiteest ive EVER seen him lol
nick has truly done everything
omg that mango was TORN APART jeezus christ
28:59 killed me 😂
The psycho murder vibes from the guys was hilarious but also slightly concerning!😂😬😂
GOD ZACH, WHY ARE YOU VIOLATING THAT MANGO??
Was Allonsy a Doctor Who reference???
Ned is the only white person that can season
If try guys were avatar character who could they be  For me:  Eugene = Zuko Ned = toph Zach = aang Keith = sauka
I kinda knew that Ned pandering to Keith with the fried chicken wouldn’t be good for him.
Keith’s meal looked so colorful and good, this man is a whole chef.
These guys are amazing at lying to each others faces lol
Eugene: "Chaos will rain!"    Me: Flashbacks to Asain of Chaos
I loved the Pun Eugene
9:56 rapunzel has entered the chat
Keith's nervousness is so endearing. 😍
Would it be horrid if the switched out the jack fruit for Durrien .... ND his face was just right there
Eugenes box literally so random lol the other boxes you can make stuff with them together
"I'd make a great killer" -Eugene Lee Yang, 2021
@sortedfood make a collab! Your brain waves have aligned!
I recommend boiling the jackfruit seed for 20 minutes before roast it, so it will be soft first then smokey 🙄
I need a Chef reacting to this video 🤩🤩🤩 PLEEEEASEEEEE
Did it bring you down south 🤣😅
We use a "bothi" for the Jackfruit here in India. Its like a knife but attached to a flat wood that is supposed to be kept on the ground and handled with a foot and both hands.
Is this the first time the try guys all cooked and not one of them turned their dish into a disaster ?
I loved the pun
Lol
I really want a try-partner version of this video
Thank you for uploading and always bringing us this quality light hearted content. I've been really down lately but the Try Guys bring some brightness to my day.
Zach chucking the coconut at the ground was so funny 😂 we love Zach💗
I really wanna try Zach's jackfruit meal it sounds so good!
I think everyone can agree that Nick is the most interesting man alive.
I am really happy for kieth
Next episode mute Keith’s mic and don’t tel him till it’s posted . Nobody wants to hear from him anyways
I feel like Ned and Zach don't like each other, that's why they don't have camera time together....it makes me bummed out lol
9:50 onwards while Keith and Ned r talking about a cast iron being a weapon gives me Rapunzel vibes
Poor Zack. Eugene gave him the hardest ingredients.
Idk but Nick is such a daddy. The built and aura... wow I'm in 😍 Edit: THE VOICE omg ❤
Bro, this is exactly like the SortedFood mystery box challenge
You should really collab with the Sorted guys it will be hilarious
This was uploaded so short ago that no one has fully watched it other than channel members so all the people commenting are stupid to not finish the video
Hello nice lady 😂
I understand you need sponsors to make your videos, but I'd recommend rethinking your contractual agreements with Kroger.  Kroger is closing a number of stores in LA, mainly in Black and Brown neighborhoods, after a new law mandated an extra $5 an hour for essential workers. Kroger also closed stores in Seattle and Long Beach following hazard pay laws.
Zach: It has never been one time, nailed it  That's what makes it so fun to watch
Seeing Zach use forks on the non-stick pan make me 😥
I love how Keith and Ned try to have a plan and kind of know what they’re doing, but Zach and Eugene were basically winging it the entire time 😂
9:56  Keith have you seen Disney's Rapunzel? That's why she carries one.
Zack’s food actually sounds really good
"this is an ourr planet vegetable?"
Zach(k?) And Eugene gave each other the hardest boxes
So you're telling me, Nick is qualified to judge food and he hasn't been in *ONE* episode of without a recipe??!
Ned: cooking like a dad Keith: cooking like a married person Zach: stabbing and hacking, chaos Eugene: making letters for kindergarten kids with a little bit of MasterChef skills
I like Eugene with a beard. He looks so handsome 🤩
Keith being amazed by the purple yam is a mood
I'm here hitches I'm sorry I'm late Lmao
So this is a merger of 2 of their best formats?
Eugene: go cut yourself and I'll kiss it Zach: (doesn't even think about it) OK
I just came from watching the other two mystery box challenges 😯
I would love to see the Try Guys try making a recipe that’s in another language
I love Zack Eugene dynamic.
No one:   Eugene: I'd make a great killer...
Living nocturnally really brings you early updated videos by The Try Guys.
I just bought a jackfruit at the grocery store and im tempted to try Zach's recipe
Eugene says he’s not as culinary inclined as the others.  Also Eugene: Wins half of the Without a Recipe Battles.
You should make try guys cooking merch. But not with dinosaurs
For the other confused brits, Rutabaga is Swede ;)
I almost only watch the try guys anymore
Ned, that intro line at the beginning of the episode was clearly an ad read from Kroger. It was really cringe.
"So go over there, cut yourself and then I'd kiss it" 🤣🤣
i loved that pun
Hope your show comes to the UK!
30 minutes and thirty one seconds of pure chaos? Youtube needs more of this content. 😀
"I'd make a great killer."- Eugene Lee Yang 2021.
How to get a kiss from Eugene: cut yourself 😂💜
I think this is the first time I’ve heard someone use Allons-y! outside of Doctor Who and I’m here for it
"I would make a good...killer"
aSiAN oF cHaoS
Eugene is here just to see his friends suffer(and im here for it)
THIS IS CHOPPED
its so chaotic when were watching ned and keith then they switch to just a really confused looking eugene and im here for it
Great ‘dish washing while watching YouTube videos’ video. Thanks guys xoxo
11:30 damn
Zach- "Everything about its appearance is telling you to stay away" - yep, don't like Jackfruit either.
I love how domestic the try guys videos are these days
" id make a great killer "
Day 1 of commenting random things on random videos    K
Love the chaos wooooo
Ned and Keith: freaking out!  Zach and Eugene: no idea what they're doing and so calm.
"Hello, Nice lady", 😂😂😂
NICK’S A FOOD CRITIC lmao this man does everything
this is such a strange masterchef episode
Woah, all look very umm..
Zach to Eugene: Hello Good Sir Eugene to Zach: Hello Nice Lady
But... it is just me or Zach seems like, grown? More solid, muscolar? His shoulders seem wider.. no? Ok, byyyyye!
Wtf is wrong with neds nose in thumbnail. And the channel is getting so so bad.  Im almost ready to unsub.
They can go to Masterchef 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂👌👌👌
"SIZZLE ME DADDY!!" -Zac Kornfeld 2021
ASIAN OF CHAOS
Petition to change the title into "Try Guys messing up in the kitchen for 30 minutes"
Ned curated a dad healthy parent box. Eugene put together something straight out of asia. Keith put stuff that kinda? matches and Zach's is just random mishmash. Just like what they cook normally.   Nice.
More without a recipe
Damn I’m arlyyy
Ur mom
I can’t wait for the try guys to get back to educational videos like giving birth and the driving while high, sober, etc
I love Eugene asking Zach what his least favorite oil is then the video moving on to a different moment. Need to be careful with big olive oil keeping a close eye on the guys 🤣
Without a Recipe, but make it sponsored
The minute Eugene said experimental, my thought went straight to “cardamom” he’s gonna try to add cardamom to this isn’t he?
Eugene in an apron with a beard, it just hits different.
Earlyyy
i love how they really edited this to look like a real tv show and then the guys just make whatever sh*t they want
I feel like Eugene just wanted to see Zach trying to cut and open the jackfruit and the coconut 😂
*IF YOURE EARLY AND FOUND MY COMMENT, you’re a LEGEND* 🎉
