Manunited iende nyumbani
The fact that mark didn’t think it’s a red for Anthony is a disgrace
2:51:37 2:51:38 2:51:54 2:51:55
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
And Harry Mags wasnt even on!
2:56:37😂😂😂
0:03 LOL🤣🤣🤣🤣
We will, we will rock!  Yeah right.
😮😮
Like Shaw been the best player on the pitch? This is United biased at its finest 😂 Mac Allister was the best player on that pitch. His overall play that night was top notch and never gave the ball away.
Feel bad for Shaw, but you are right the Ref was poor, should have booked Rashford for diving and Anthony should have been sent off.
favorite icecream is magnum:)
Ten Hag is just average... get him out!
Brighton last x3 Prem against Utd 4-0,1-2,1-0 🕺🏽🥂
He said he doesn't like Brighton anymore 😭
I hate Brighton now! Who gives a flying fxxk Mark, lol. BHAFC.
Gotta love that Fergie time.
BRIGHTON KING
Mr. Goldbridge, those glasses you wear don't seem to be rose tinted, are you ever going to take them off?
Moaning about the ref when he left Antony on wow. Show some gratitude
Ten Hag with that Spursy energy
Liverpool
2:59:05 I prefer rivers to the sea 😂😂😂
This is class 😂😂😂😂😂
Aye keep luke shaw 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Shaw motm😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😊
stonewall penalty
2:54:44 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Please: -support Italian FOOTie teams and/or; Celtic, F.C. -(M.K.S. Italian FOOTie, can!! -M.K.S.).
"I like rivers." classic. I really enjoy watching your anguish and agony in the last few minutes. sadistic I know, but for me it is fantastic entertainment.
You better not mess up 4th place or the Scousers will have a good summer transfer window being able to offer CL.
Ref was useless.
Shaw should have got a second yellow card, refs have different rules for United 😡
Next up the chosen one
I bet he ate his words saying Shaw has been class after that handball costing us the match.
Get what you deserved
antony is 100 million flop😂
No energy in this team... So boring to watch, since opponent has more possession, the possession United has, is when they waste time in throw ins etc etc..
Has any other team done the double over Utd this season?
@2:50:45 Luke Shaw praise 😄
Hahaha 😂😂😂😂
You have to talk about Utd like you talk about villa past glory don’t count you’re doing so good this year to fight for top four it’s a super successful season!!!!😢
They rock you you instead 😂😂😂
Top 4 secured huh? Lol
😂😂😂😂😂😂  UTA
if glazers stay in any way not penney more
Our attack is tooooooo pathetic n no coordination, martial is too lazy n rashford is completely lost
2:55:40 penalty
De Zerbi deserves this United fall at the last minute.
Defo deserved to lose tbf
LOL he said give us the one point... few seconds later . penalty hahaha
Haaa revenge. Nice one Brighton 😝
No Ronaldo No Party
“Marriners fault” 💀💀💀💀💀
😅😅😅
He always says something then a minute later it blows up in his face. Priceless
Justice for Brighton after losing in semi final.
Well you can keep your second place in the FA cup and thank you for the six points this season you mugs!
Casemiro  should  have been  sent  off he is short to everything
This is football heritage
Honestly glad Ten Hag goes with lindelof and shaw as CBS anymore
Started as Goldbridge, ended as Greybridge..
united should have had a red and brighton deserved the win considering how bad utd played all 2nd half. You can say that Luke Shaw didn't deserve that yellow for that free kick, but it stopped his momentum in the final mins. Not a yellow i agree. It should have a been a yellow for the pen!
United's loss pissed me off even more than Klopp didn't change his tactics earlier. Top 4 should have been a breeze. No chance now.
It was annoying watching Martial today, looked lazy and seem to be in his own bubble. We need a first team striker and a rotating striker, Martial is just not that guy anymore.
Our midfield is still getting dominated by teams...but it's not mcfred so no one is complaining
Brighton were brilliant
Yanited get battered everywhere they goooo 😂😘
Funny old game
Overrated players
Last minute bridge   Proper Dreamer!
GIVE ME THEM MAN UNITED TEARS
😂😂😂
We are crap compared to Brighton to be honest.🤮🤮🤚👺🇶🇦
Brighton deserved that all night long. United were cheating, diving, moaning and being thugs.
Trollers gather...
The quad squad🤭🤭🤭🤭
At least they didn't get the penalty after the final whistle ...
Haha brilliant 😂
Yes, Mark likes only the teams that lose against United.🥴 He doesn't like Brighton anymore.🤗
Utd were once again terrible absolutely outclassed by a team with a quarter of utd's budget bad bad defeat 🤦‍♂️
Hope the scouse beat Utd to top 4 😂
laughing
Wow, a footballing lesson by Brighton to Utd....
"we deserve a point".. No you didn't. Look at the stats...
“I hate de zerbi because of his smug face” * stans Bruno fernandes *
People who are saying Man United won't make the top 4 clearly don't understand football... their last 4 games are West Ham, Wolves, Bournemouth and Chelsea ffs😂
hahahhhahahah, i can see a H-T fire drill in the united end in the final against City ,everyone out at 4-0 down,,,HAAAAALAND
I think tten hag lack a bit of tacktics changes ..
basically he only likes teams he beats
Unlucky mark
I really feel for Mark but just because he is honest IMO I’m Arsenal but you’d never have guessed…
2:54:54 Penalty Check 2:57:35 Mac Allister 1-0 (p)
😂😂😂😂 love it watching u loss it 😂😂😂
Rashford world class 😂😂😂
I really enjoyed that !!!
Jinxbridge "it's been a complete performance by Luke Shaw tonight"..😂
Luke shaw🎉
@2:37:48 ... For me Luke Shaw is the man of the match. Wow Great Prediction 👍👍😄
Good u lost
I recommend watching the matches at the psychologist
😂😂 the crooked referee couldn't keep saving Man United any longer.
WE LOVE YOU BRIGHTON WE DO
Should have been a well earned draw. Real frustrating defeat and just typical that Brighton would win with a penalty in the 99th minute when beaten on penalties in Wembley. Not sure what Shaw was at but he was arguably man of the match before giving away that penalty.    I'd fear those wasted opportunities by Martial, Rashford would come back to haunt and that's how it turned out.    9 points still required to finish top 4, need to bounce back against West Ham on Sunday with a win.
Brighton were better, the ref was on your side and they still beat you 😂😂😂 It was a foul by Luke Shaw btw 😂😂😂
91 minutes. "lets talk about how good Luke Shaw has been..." 93 minutes. Luke Shaw gets booked. 94 minutes. Luke Shaw handles and gives away a penalty, which is converted and you lose the game. Quality entertainment!
We are not improving as a team. Why won’t the training involve passing and keeping the ball rather than just passing like kids in the park. Surely, it has to be on the coach. Our play is really boring and getting outplayed away.
SELL Sancho,Mc tominay,Fred,weghorst,maguire,martial, elanga,Jones BUY De jong,osimhen,toney,timber,mc alister,neymar, asensio
Cool hand Luke.
All what work Brighton played you off the park accept it😊
If Liverpool get in top4 that would be really embarrassing
That ps5 joke😂
Tottenham: " We're always bottling it" United: "Hold my beer" 😂😂😂😂
Why you complaining? you’re the only team in PL history to get a penalty after the final whistle!
Never a foul by shaw are you mad? Referees fault? Your lucky Casemiro and Anthony weren’t given a red card
Lol never deserved a point
Coming here and skipping to 95th min 😅
They are rubbish
All Top 4 sides are playing better football. It's absolutely shocking from this team.
Man United going to bottle top 4
Mac Allister already a Liverpool legend!
Mediocre side and for some time now, got no clue going forward. Average
Mark: "For me Luke Shaw should be the man of the match " (This is what writers call foreshadowing, or in other words jinxing)😂😂😂
Brilliant
2:58:51 aww he doesn’t like brighton anymore 😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣
United got lucky it was only 1-0 and how tf was Antony not sent off 😂😂😂
I can’t believe we are blaming refs for our terrible mistakes. We’ve become Arsenal from those years ago
United should have had at least one red card so well done Brighton !
Thanks for allowing us back into the top 4 battle. Ps Liverpool
luke shaw man of the match , few minutes later luke shaw whats he doing!
Terrible the whole game, wym only second half
Dogs*** again. Sick of this team need a huge bloody clear out.
and this is Why Martial should be sold. We desperately need a CF
Rival fans! We gather here yet again, this sport that brings us all together, to laught at MANCHESTER UNITED 🤣
Troll
Brighton got their revenge
Hahaha well dezerbed hahahah
Utd absolutely awful away from home. Ten Hag doesn’t know how to win away.
Love when the ref turns a tie into a loss over a completely blatant flop. Any commons sense and it’s never a foul and never a corner and never a pk and they don’t win…
If united concede 4th to Liverpool mark will probably delete his channel 😂
Man Utd is the weakest team among the top 6 😢😢
Famous last words during stoppage time -  “Give me the point.  Give me the point.”    What point ??? 😂😂😂
Excuse FC
It's about time people accept, this bunch of players are average, ten hag is average, he has to take responsibility...rubbish. struggling to get over the line...joke
how casimero didn't get a red is quite concerning, and very suspicious. united paying refs as usual.
Why do we keep conceding corners in the last minute in every game
Brighton have done the double over Manchester United. But apparently ten Haag is a generational manager 😂😂😂
Now we're even fellas.
That attack needs to be got rid of including rashford
They calling it Shawhand redemption 😅
we  need to be outside champions league so the glaziers will sell  and we need Qatar in . Shaw , Sancho , Rushford , Fred , McT , AWB , martial ,  are not good enough and need replacing
What you gonna do … what you gonna do …when they come for you … Liverpool Liverpool
Utd very poor up front. 😤😤😤top 4 in danger.
Who came & skipped right to the 95th min🤣
What work Mark. You are lucky you lost only 1-0
All this shiz abt Luke shaw when you couldn’t do much better🥱
2:54:41 "give me the point"... just before penalty 😄
All of this Ten Hag fandom is way overblown man. Average performances from United almost all season. When Liverpool and Chelsea are back at it next season, United are gonna struggle badly to compete for Europe.
Motm... Ref
Cracking second half. Brighton deserve the points.
Mac Allister is one hell of a footballer! Brighton are just a joy. Well deserved win. What was Antony thinking??
Give me the points....give me the point......pen Brighton 😂❤
What you expect when Fred is starting
Thats united
😂😂😂😂 Penalty in Fergy time.
Sick of saying that ETH is finding out that these guys are not good enough, massive rebuild, let's be honest Brighton aren't that great but dominated. Yet again players gone missing
No more top 4 for us. We are done for the season.
So poor in the second half;-(. But still could have held out for a draw.
Mark already didn't trust this ref...it's a shame penalty😢😮😮😮😢
Luke shaw flawless performance
Brighton were better than us can't complain really. Just so fucking wasteful our forwards.
If even tries to blame the ref
goldbridge with another costly jinx with that luke shaw tweet
Shite club , shite fans , shite club
This is what happens when you don’t control games Utd should never play for draws
Give him a point.... 😀😀😀
The only reason we are where we are because all the other teams have been so bad. No better than a top 8 team in my opinion
Love it! In your face, Manx
Rashford Is Dreadful
Brighton dominated that second half. Just have to admit: They deserved that one. And what a cold mf Mac Allister is haha
Rashford 🤣🤣🤣
😂 We’re coming for you
Great refereeing 👌
All day a pen
Hope Brighton enjoy not being in the FA cup final
2:54:45 "Gimme the point"
We will we will rock you
"Give me the point"
I am tired of people constantly criticizing Weghorst. He is not the reason for our poor performance in the forward line. The real issue is our inability to create chances. It's interesting how no one mentions Bruno when discussing this.  Furthermore, how is it possible that we are playing with only ten men when Rashford and Bruno have contributed very little in the second half? It's time to stop blaming Weghorst for everything.
I still think united haven't changed they still depend on individual brilliance. Last season Ronaldo was scoring the goals , this season it's Rashford and when he(Rashford ) doesn't perform there's a drop off
2:54:55 is what you are here for
shaw about to get battered
They might have won a mickey mouse cup but the United team doesn't move me. Not much different from Ole's united. Mid.
😂😂
Come on Brighton !!!!! Europe awaits !!!!
The way we’re playing at the moment wouldn’t be surprised if we bottle top 4. Shambles
Well deserved
The subs are costing United big time
No top four 🤣
Hahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaahahahgahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahaagahahahahahahahahahhahhahaahahhaahahahahahahahaha
Ohh the Irony🤣🤣 Won by a penalty 🤣
The reality is English players like Shaw , Rashford and Sancho  cost  us that game . Lack of intelligence , lack of effort , lack of bottle . Get them out of the club
Yanited bottling the top 4. We will be there no matter what
Need to invest in the team no press and nothing draw would have been a lucky result
2:57:39
2:55:10 is why you are here
Flops
POV: You’ve come here straight after the game
All these players need to get a tattoo of a bottle on their forehead. Absolute shiet. Seriously we need to sell Rashford, Sancho Maguire and get 12 new players. Can't believe how shiet this team is. Crap!
Glorious 😂
Soon to be Liverpool player sinks the most overrated United team in years.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂i love lost
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Honestly the ref didn't control the game at all. Fair pena...but it should never have come to that!
HAVE THATTTT
Thursday nights here comes united lol
So glad I turned it on just at the end 😂😂😂
Liverpool bee looking at that top 4 spot 👀
Brighton just better. We played OK, but couldn't match Brighton. Good night.
as much as how i hate argentina i love this guy he doesn’t feel pressure come to city🇧🇼!
wtf is shaw thinking
Lets go Brighton
Luke Shaw, what a fella 😂
That ref is a joke  Making stupid decisions in the game not giving clear fouls
2nd half syndrome once again !!! How many fucking times.
Bottlers🤣🤣🤣🤣
Total f**kng disaster... ETH is just clueless
No way mark, said "gimme the point(for United)" and they was a penalty awarded 5 seconds after, you can't write this😂😂😂
The manager is an absolute fraud, how can you spend soo much and play the football they do? No clue tactically and look absolutely piss poor coaching wise. United have either bottled or got hammered in soo many games this season it's madness. Hey, Ten Haag is the saviour apparently, standards in the bloody bin lmao.
Luke Shaw is a c...t ! He sold out.
C'mon Brighton
After the rashford ballondor shouts hes disappeared
this is football heritage! redemption for brighton, karma for shaw😂 fully deserved the better team won.
And Brighton were the better team
Remember Maupay in 2020?
Ten Hag is not serious
Damn
Disgraceful performance from the attack. Utd don't deserve top 4
Fuking piece of turd penalty?!
Man utd the gift that keeps giving
Match of the season. We went downhill soon after the subs
hahahhahaha
Wtf is Shaw doing. Jumping with his hands in the air.
United keep playing like this top 4 is gone
There is no service - Rashford is a striker - Antony can’t cross
wtf.
brighton do the double on united 😂
sad that that’s a penalty because it’s a natural position for a footballer, but can’t complain Brighton played class second half
Bottlers 😂
Bottlebridge😂
Deserved win for Brighton. They were the brighter team😁. Gotta love that as a neutral (really nice fun flow to the way Brighton play) - it was a bit of fossil football from United, granted they're missing their first CBs so I get the pragmatism. United came out playing for a draw second half.. Goldie always whining about reffing, epl reffing is atrocious tho.
United in the mud
Ahahahah
Well?
unpopular opinion, brighton is a dirty team
Lol
we didnt deserve a result AT ALL
Be very careful with that Top 4 spot. Liverpool are coming 👀
Brighton deserved the win let's be honest
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Lol
Horrible 2nd half
😂
Fuming
