Vivica damn what a hottie  Her and Tony Braxton are fire
They dated for three months. Calling someone “the love of your life,” when it’s only three months, is crazy.
So basically money impresses you.
He love bombed her - she fell for a narc
He made Chelsea Handler go crazy too. Lol.
Shes beautiful inside and out. ❤
Love you Viv, always have always will, thank you for sharing your talents with the greatest generation ever.
Let it go!!!
She thought she was too good for him in her prime not be realizing his was yet to come🤦🏾‍♀️Delulu
He love bombed her
So its ok for everybody to "live their truth" and "love who you want" until its this someone. Ok. Got it.
Dang she really loved him. ❤
I just love her. She’s just fantastic. So open, so kind and likable. I think she would have been an AWESOME mom. She says it’s one of her biggest regrets. Her heart is genuinely warm and u can tell when she loves, she loves hard
VLAD❤ VIV SAID THEY WENT WAY TOO PUBLIC TOO FAST. HE SET IT OFF PUBLICLY WHEN HE SHOUTED OUT THE DRESS AT THE SHOW ❤❤❤❤❤  NOW 20 YEARS LATER ❤😢😢😢😢
STAY IN YOUR AGE LANE AND STOP GETTING YOUR HEART BROKEN BY THESE YOUNGER PLAYERS!!  YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER!!
I like how 50 cent was in the shower with the switchblade no offense to the good looking men who were naked just imagine the good looking men in the lgbt community secretly fisting or having sex with weirdos in porn thats a good wake up call no offense to the straight community 💯
So why now she talking 😮about don’t dare no rappers 😢
See I love this❤ She has a totally different description of him. Different man with different women. The accusation of him not giving his ex $10K or ANY money throughout the relationship could've been he didn't feel loved by her. He may have felt like she was trying to use him...it happens! I know whenever I'd see them it was like she was repulsed.  He'd daut on her but I never saw it reciprocated.
Yeah any dude would be nuts to date her now
Lies! She said he gay years ago
It took for him to leave her for her to gain this wisdom... She would nvr have gained this relationship knowledge had he stayed with her. Sometimes leaving someone makes them better for the next person. She sounds like her emotions are better logically.
Girl it was bet awards
she would have aged better without the face work
this is sad, she traded money for having a family and a loving husband
she is AWESOMMMMMME!!!
He didn't love you
She is pathetic grow up he's moved on granny
She is pathetic grow up he's moved on granny
Embarrassing herself
There's 50cent   And there's Curtis , my grandma's baby
1:20 he's so generous pentru că a dat 5-10.000 e pe niște flori? Dar să-i fi dat la niște copii care aveau nevoie nu-i a dat.
She is so sweet. Honestly. She doesn’t deserve tge way he has been treating her.
He wasn’t gonna just settle for her truth be told ! He was young and too many temptations.
What did she do to her face 😢?
WTF! She was one of the most beautiful women in the world to me, surgery gone wrong. Devastated teen crush gone 💔
Why would she say that guy is the love of her life. I mean the man is deplorable. Black women should really aim higher 😮
Meanwhile her current boyfriend watching this
It was the B.E.T Awards not SoulTrain
Jeez the surgeries fucked her beauty up
Plastic surgery really fucked her up
Talk about someone that lost her looks. She looks swollen.
You make it work regardless- I am not buying it
Surgery made her awful
Why guys flowers jewelry or makeup or rv is mkre useful
I just watched that I want to thank vivica Fox for wearing that dress I knew it the look on her face that they were going to hook up at some point
It’s was definitely the BET awards not the soul train award😂
Back in her old films like Set it off and Two can play that game  she was naturally beautiful, now you can tell she had surgery on her face she doesn’t look the same, I mean yeah she’s still beautiful now  but she messed up her face 🤦🏽‍♀️
I STILL WANNA DEAL WITH MS. VIVICA SO BAD.....
I love Vivica Fox but I think when a woman knows a man doesn’t want her or like her she should accept truth and forget that person and focus on loving yourself, life is too short to be miserable.
She dodged a bullet. Fiddy is a lunatic with all his incoherent rambling coupled with emotional immaturity. Good for you Vivica😊
Yeah another victims of identity issues she was very beautiful and destroys her Natural Beauty  But this depends often on the Fake people you Surround yourself with
Wtf this is Not her. Damn shame
She didn’t have to do nothing to her face these women be messing up they face and body thinking they need enhancement
Am I the only one that knows that it was the BET awards like seriously
Regardless of the break-up, Queen Vivi a admits that Curtis was the love of her life and will always have a place in her heart....that's real rap ❤
Give her another chance 50
She fucked up her face, what the hell! Why!!
Love of my life..... Nuts
Here after 50 Ig comment😂
Think she is lovely and honest
Botox a HELL OF A DRUUUHHHG
okay, its sad that she blew up into a water ballon after this video. but honestly this is where she started to get piggy.
I love that she doesn’t speak badly of him and she just is happy for the experience of being with him
I’ll never understand the whole Hollywood scene so I guess I need to plastic surgery my whole body .
FIDDY A SIMP
it'd be very challenging to have a "private" relationship with .50 anyway....
She use to have sex appeal out the roof
2:49 yup, this killed my relationship too, we had too many people in our business
50 cent dodged a bullet.
She won't let him go
She looks like a surgery experiment
She didn’t explain why they broke up…..hella red flag 🚩🚩🚩
“I was already Vivica Fox”…. Narcissism at its ugliest…she had two “mainstream” movies at best….and a sitcom watched primarily by black folks. But that’s not the point; like most modern black women, she desired and prioritized a career, independence. And that’s what she got. The idea of relationship/marriage wasn’t a priority because she “thought” she had forever, didn’t need a man, was happy being single, blah blah blah… fast forward life…100lbs later, 5 surgeries into senior citizenship…she “now” appreciated 50, and while he would NEVER want that back,.. he grew larger in stature, still fit, more money… she is now in the habit of reflection… that is to say REGRET! The problem is 50 or no other guy is knocking on her door. Every year she gains 20 more pounds, and has evolved from Vivica Fox to Vivica Cow… She can’t blame this on “youth”… she blew her most productive years and potential for marriage because she was “Vivica Fox”…. And who is that exactly? Just another single, black, independent woman with a 8000sq ft house, money perhaps, and lots of girl trips then home to her cat….no one cares at this point.
I like this
Y she do that to her face
It's just ridiculous after  to talk in these terms about a relationship that last less than 90 days!  20 years later. C'mon man...
when 50 said that line about her + her dress at the VMAs, bet he never imagined he’d actually end up in a serious relationship with her. Haha.
Vivaca and Lil Kim. Why did they do that to themselves?
WHAT BUMBLEBEE STUNG HER IN HER LIPS? Ship’s ahoy!
she seems nice lady
Eine ungeschriebene Liebe....
Why she wearing a wig????
You would think these women would STOP with the fking surgery. Vivica is the kind of beauty that never needs any freakin surgical altering. Nothing is ever FIXED with plastic surgery and she didn’t need it.
He still loves her most of all.
Another 304 that gave up the glu (usher). All these stars sleeping around and been with anybody and everybody. They have not learned that love don’t love nobody except mother and child bond. Then she wears too much make up. She should have known all he wanted was a happy meal.
Yup you loved him very much. Even to this day. What you don't seem to understand vivica, is that your love for him was nowhere as strong as his love for you. That is if even loved you at all. I have never seen a video with him saying that was in love with you....
She used to be beautiful before she obviously got all that plastic surgery. I don’t know of anyone who looked better after plastic surgery other than burn victims
It’s never “YOU” it’s WYD(DO) for ppl. 😂😂😂marriage is a joke
Taking turns with the “love of your life” 😂😂😂😂😂50 drive won’t keepin her
Obviously she's still in love with him.
50 cent needs a woman he knows it know but VIV got the plastic surgery she was beautiful naturally!
Laaawwdd, she look like a ghoul...
She sound like she regret it
Why she need to fuck with her face? She was perfect
Liar 🤦‍♀️
She’s older than Mike Tyson
Who’s here in 2024
Everybody in the comments pretending she’s a good person for this interview. But ignore the fact that she called him gay and dragged him for years because he left her.
She was dickmatized
bruv publicity CANT to love ... sorry I aint buying that
It was a let down for me to see Vivica with all the surgeries to her once beautiful face!  She's still a beautiful woman but I think she would be prettier with her original untouched self.  Sadly in Hollywood and else where women think they need to do this!  But damn...50 got to smash this beauty?  Hope he treated her well.  Fox/Keys 2 all time beauties of the time!
This was the beginning of the fillers and Botox…..it all settled so wrong after decades of use
My respect for both 50 and Vivica is 10/10. Absolute role models. Respectful and kind people. The fact they are split up and are in the show biz / rap industry makes this even more impressive.
Keep your friends out your relationship business. Private is better. A and B is all that is needed!
50 a simp
Wtf happened to get face?  Holy shit
Ugh, actors just destroy their natural good looks all the time. Vivica needed NO surgery. She looks terrible now
if you’ve never even received one single plastic Dollar Tree rose from a man that you’re dating for years  and then a man comes along  ( that you’ve been dating for a few months) and fills your entire house with you’re favorite flower… yea… that’s not something you forget or get over. Nelly and Ashanti found their way back to each other. I hope 50 & Viv do the same.
I remember watching kill bill and my friend said she’s got such a manly nose. Now I can’t unsee it. 😂
‘When I met Vivica, I thought I was on to something…by next week, mannnn it was nothin’
Very beautiful ❤
She seems crazy
😂😂😂 Fellas take notes.  The reason 50 is the "love" of her life is because he was by far the most rich/famous man that got with her. They dated for 3 months ffs.
“I was Vivica Fox ya know, I was used to fame” 🙄🫣
This is how women sound when they've talked their way out of a relationship and later reFLected!
she sounds SO similar to Jennifer Aniston.
I always love them as a couple when they were together.  I really wished they could've worked it out. *deep sigh* They were a force to be reckoned with.  😥
Well now hes with white heaux, so you dodged a bullet
Wow.respect
50 hit it so good she will never hate him
always knew curtis was a great guy and 50 was just the altered ego
I did not recognise Vivica. Damn.
Because the relationship went public too fast….. ok we’ll go with that
Sound like 50 dumped her when he was done with her.
Every woman 50 was with says the same thing about him being the love of their lives lol bruh doesn't go half way with women 😅
She said soul train awards  Vlad said the VMAs  when it was actually  the BET awards
Man if they would’ve stayed together
Abdul Qadar MuhammadTyrone Michael Green CARDIAIR21557THSTPHPAWPNENJNE  , I We Appreciate you All and Ms Vivica Fox , Sista 🫡👑🗽✡️☮️☯️💯🇺🇸🙏🏾 9
She'sstill inlove with Fif. Just look at the glow  when she talks about him. Wish they are still together.
Who cares what people think! Love and date who you want.
That was the BET Awards..😂😂 50 Cent didn't go diamond..😂😂
Yes why would a beautiful black woman want plastic herself. What does she see when she looks in the mirror
I respect this...
Love this ❤
You found out he was messing with SB tell the truth......
I think even if they kept their relationship private it would not have worked since she was older than him and would still have left her for a younger woman.
Til my last breath I will NOT understand how such a classy lady like her could fall for such a canal rat like him!
I love my mamas
She's too old for him
She was so pretty in Independence Day.  She’s done some kind of surgery and doesn’t look the same anymore.
50 was and is never gonna be faithful so it was never gonna work. No rapper is gonna be a good spouse unless you're willing to put up with them cheating and treating you like crap like snoop's wife to maintain the lifestyle
50 cents sound like a gentleman........ like he knows how to treat a lady....
She is fake af. I know someone who worked with her for years & said she she talked down to people & ordered them around.  VERY nasty & pretentious  & cheap.  I was so disappointed
Its crazy how much better looking she was. What kinda magic trick did they perform??  lmao i just went back to google her dress from the night 50 complimented her... DAMNNN... the difference is day and night
respect for her honesty but man did she lose them looks, to much work done on that face
Beautiful 🤩 personally and yes she still is beautiful
50 cent love-bombed Vivica.
She loved curtis , you can feel the emotion
Welp. Princely & 50 unfollowed each other
Love Vivica. She is super funny!
Vivica should’ve just allowed herself to age gracefully like Halle currently is
I liked fox a lot but was unsure why she got the work done. Bless her
I know right 😮
I don't believe her I feel she was controlling in he is not the type of kat you can hold down
Respect to this woman
Idk why she loves his toxic ass..:
She never heard of the company you keep she's a lowlifewhen you'd ate lowlifes
Keep “the love of your life” sh** to yourself. Your killing your chances of finding another one. We as men don’t want to hear the special place in my heart love of my life talk. It means the new flame will never have your undivided attention.👎🏽 BUT, at least she’s being honest and not putting him down because it’s over.
I just Love Vivica Fox, always been beautiful and real. Very talented too
And just like that, she went from being from one of America's beloved sweetheart actresses and doing blockbusters like "Independence Day" to doing commercials for car warranty companies! Her career never recovered after that hook up! 😂
Vivica fox always been real
Damn what happened to her face
She will forever be a Icon for set it off SHE WAS STUNNING ALL OF THEM MY GOD❤❤❤
❤❤❤
wow Im amazed
She is the most beautiful woman I have seen on screen. I am so proud of her. She is an  icon for many young female actors that are coming up.  She  has a spicy look and the way she portrays  her act is so excellent.  God bless her. Keep up the good work Viv. God bless.
I barely recognize her
I can’t imagine dating someone that famous.  There is always going to be another pretty face and younger woman around the corner.
She’s finished
Original pimp!!!!! I'm not mad at all kns break!!!  11  biological children from 11 different women.  Kns break!!!
Curtis.. lmao 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣...50!!!!!!.....
Ummm ummm 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔... long time ago!!!!!!...if it true!!!! She committed the robbery!!!!...her crib!!!!!...took advantage of me!!!!!...,ummm I remember..miss m.....Sofia ?????,no last name!!!! They know I'm positive.
I'm positive I know you Vivaca .....ummm ????...,if it is you...me and you.had a situation?????ummm give the location??? Bronx NY little Italy.. I remember you if Im positive??? U fucking committed the robbery!!!!!!.. went to your crib.  Long time ago!!!!! If I'm positive...ummmm miss vivica took advantage of me????...I'm trying to remember...if true.. Curtis 50 was mine way before you....Curtis what goody...yo man???
I'm sure 50 would've probably taken her back if she said this many years ago and behaved but aye, it is what it is. It's nice to hear how she feels, thanks for sharing ma'am.
She's absolutely beautiful after 20 years in that dress
I AGREE SHES EXTREMELY BEAUTIFUL SHES MY FAVORITE ACTRESS
"he was the love of my live"..woww
I like her honesty, but what does she really want from 50?
Too any future man even thinking about dating this woman, just don’t lol. 50 has marked her for life, he could have her back at the drop of a hat
all Hollywood people destroy themselves with these injections because they are told they wont work if they dont do it. they also point out everyone is doing them.  nothing sexier than just living in the now and ignoring bulshit age
Bet awards
Fifty the gentleman
I guess Kevin Samuels was right ..Vivica is so independent and rich but can't get a man to marry her..she will die alone
Because he likes them young.
Respect 🙌
She really loved him
They dated for 4 months 😂
So sad these women had the pick of the litter but thought it would last forever smh.   They should help young black women know the truth
Wow man❤️. I respect Viv for being honest and also showing respect for her ex. Sometimes things just don't workout man, but I can feel the love in her voice.
Girl that was at the BET awards 😂 but yea.
Viv and lil Kim 2 beautiful woman who didn't need the surgeries
Wooot why Da hell she got a face surgery fckk she messed up :((
This is a couple that I wish would've last, also I don't think she would've had surgery as much as she has. Curtis Jackson seems to be a real gentleman. I hope they both find their soulmates the true love of their life.
Dam she used to be so fine...   Before the surgeries
“Commitment for me ahh, nah. not likely.  Went out with Vivica I thought, I was onto somethin. But then the next week NAH. Man It was nothin” 😂😂
Chile that’s a Leo ♌️ woman for ya….once they get their claws in a man they NEVER let go!! N it doesn’t matter how much you try and warn them, they never listen unless you’re telling them what THEY wanna hear 🥴
He had her as his crazy ex stalker in “Do You Think About Me.” 😂 It was cute.
She slowly looking like lil Kim 😂
Nah. V. You got old!! Look at the chick he is with now...
imagine trying to get married to a dude while you talk about another man is the love of your life
Wow. Her face!!! Its ok to age Vivica. Peace to the Queen nevertheless.
Messed up her face
Look like Micheal Jackson before the surgery it's an emergency
Vlad you perv
She used to look so fkn good, when are women like this going to realise that surgery doesnt make then look better.
It was the Bet awards not the soul train vivica!!
Vivica fucked herself up
She better stop getting surgeries. Sound likes she's talking through a hole in her face. She missed the boat and she's sick now that he's the man and her fame is little. 50 saw her phoney spotlight attention grabbing attitude. Girl bye.
Why she get all that surgery done
Pls leave 50 alone..he has moved on!
Woman really need to stop putting shit in their lips...its ridiculous
fuck surgeries!  she is beautiful without those!
Being on Vlad TV means you are washed up
Old hoe stories.
That’s was my crush forever
Sounds like Vivica got “alpha-widowed.” Which explains why she’s still single…no man since can compare to fofty
Viv you don't need the lip fillers.. beautiful without
She's confused like most women. He liked her before she opened her mouth and started talking....She thought she was the prize...She thought the man was supposed to "sumbit" then 50 split...and her old ass still doesnt understand what happened....
She got Alpha Widowed.
Fif is a G lol
That's my girl she is still beautiful. I'm glad they broke up cause she can do better
Dats what da magic stick does to women 🤷
I know v who the hell is this lizard?
50 sound like he know how to pay for sex with style lmao
The skit they did on BET was hilarious lol
Vivica and lil Kim went to the same doctor smh
Does Vlad think drums in the back looks nice lol change the set up man!😂
Love of your life ? You were only with him for a couple of months 😂😂
She lying thats not the love of her life lol i respect it though oh that dress was daammnnn
Facts
Everybody loves 50 cent as far as his relationship, I could only imagine ❤😊
So 50 was tearing that azz apart back in the day😂
man she age like a white person lol
Don’t make no sense when you consider her public personality for her to say 50 was the love of her life. I mean, polar opposite. I keep yelling at Bros that they got to be themselves and f all these women. Whoever is going to die to be with you is going to be with you. Women are so self centered, so bros got to be the same.
Damn it's a shame she was so beautiful she f*cked her face up with surgery
50 gave her the magic stick and she got the ugly stick from her dr. She Used to be a smoke show
Damn!I don’t understand why she did all that to her face, she was a natural beauty and now she just looks ridiculous
She scared to get old
She was getting banged down 😂😂😂
Vivica was fine before the surgery. I guess she following the celebrity train of getting plastic surgery. What happened to age gracefully, naturally? Still fine though. Lol.
Thought he didn't spend money on women 🤔
Most African Americans are crazy....lol Very hard to keep relationships, always baby mamas, baby daddys, why do dey keep getting pregnant unneccessarily....lol
He just wanted to smash and used the timing for his status 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 imagine a self proclaimed  strong, independent, smart woman like Vivica fox falling for simple game😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💀☠️💀☠️💀
He’s the love of your life but he’s gay according to you? I guess two things can be true no matter how weird it feels.
I can tell she really loves him. To be honest, I think 50 cent was intimidated by her . He knows she the type can throw them hands with u.  Ride or die chick.  😂
They broke up when she started getting surgery he wasn’t okay with that
1. 50 cent was your F**k Boy  2. Too much plastic surgery  3. 50 still relevant your not 4. 50 engaged. Vivica hit the wall lol
Damn ! Sista messing herself up. Looking like a Barbie doll 😢
50 put that d on her ass
Sad because the women 50 dealing with now are younger and even though Fox is beautiful..she can't compete with these younger baddies
Fif is that nigga!! I really enjoyed watching his growth and his whole turn around in life.
Alpha Widow, textbook  It’s like Twilight and wolves, once they imprint on you, it’s over 😂  Look at Tupac and Jada  Future and Rihanna  🤷🏻‍♂️
His face 😮
Boy oh boy she can get it
Time is unfair.
But blaming everyone but yourself is not what broke the relationship.
Why do naturally beautiful women have surgery that they don’t need? Lil Kim , oooh my has destroyed her appearance. V. Fox was already beautiful 🤦🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️
I hope one day Vivica and Curtis mend things and get back together.  Anything is possible in this game called love. And they are both are single so why not.
Respect
I see everyone is giving her accolades on her beauty and somewhat transparent honesty, but 50 ( Curtis Jackson) saw what Kevin Samuels saw and brought out of her- Real men see the warning ⚠️ signs early, and sometimes we stay, but if your smart ( Men) bounce !! Its okay to look back reminisce - but in a lot of cases, we look back and we realize we dodged a bullet, but it doesn’t mean we didn’t care or even loved 🥰 the person, its just what they were dealing with, is much bigger than the both of us and in the end, it leads to a toxic breakdown and break-up  ... does that make them a bad person ( not at all) but the energy spent, is gonna be too much, especially when your trying to achieve greatness- its better to be patient,  wait and heal, so you can stay focus and direct your energy and that’s exactly the choice 50 made, and it was the best choice for him 😅
Vivica is the most real of the real! I love her. Classy, honest, attractive, professional, beautiful and just THE BOSS!!! 🥰
Got a date with destiny, she's more than a girl
She loved him and 50 was just try to fuck as many dumb bitches as possible. Notice how he’s never been married stupid?
That's one of the prices of fame ruining in your privacy.
😂😂😂😂😂 now died alone
She clearly said he WAS not IS...people only hear what they wanna
That is one reason why I understand some men and women do not post their mates all social media because you can let that tear you down in a matter of months just because what somebody is saying or what somebody is doing
She looks plastic
50 f*cked that goofy b*tch head up so much, she started playing with her face😂😂😂😂
This is really cringe
Black women will have a better chance if they married white rich men.
Every women that’s been with 50 is mesmerized by him.
People break up all the time. Stay out of their business
He said In his song that he thought she was on something and found she wasn't on shit , and that she licked his ass , this is who she described as a gentleman ???? No wonder she had a problem with Kevin Samuels exposing women in our community thats bitter and toxic and unable to maintain a relationship ,  she said she couldn't keep 50 because ppl got in there business when everyone else can plainly see she was just a booty call to a young dude that just got on top , I'll never see her the same after the way she took a victory lap after Kevin Samuels death , he her and Lisa raye revealed a lot of ignorance and evil .
VIVICA IS EVIL
VIVICA IS BITTER AND EVIL😈👿👿👿😈👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿
VIVICA IS BITTER AND EVIL😈👿😈👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿
Trying to open her eyes to much surgery darling your beautiful natural
I wish more Women would be this honest.
I guess Black Lives Matter
Car insurance commercial .my favorite commercial u the host🌹
MEGAN GOOD SAID THE SAME THING ABOUT FIF LOL!
I thought 50 said she tried to claim him and thought she was taking over and he had to put her out his house lmao.... SOMEBODY LYING
She tryna get on power loool
She was a natural beauty.. sad
Didn’t Maegan Good also say Fif was the love of her life?
Yeah sure you loved him. If uncle Billy had that much money, you would love him too! To this day....
I love Vivica!❤️❤️
Is that the same lady? Wow. She was hot, I dunno if it’s age or surgery. Crazy. She still hot but lost that natural look
Whatever she's doing to her face and voice...she needs to stop.  She was already a beautiful woman. SMH
This is a beautiful woman.
didn't work for megan good keeping it a secret so don't feel too bad
Loved them together so much!
If an Average Joe sent a ton of flowers to some woman he's just getting involved with, he would've been dropped like a hot rock, and she would've high-tailed it outta there!
Nobody… vivica a fox… yeus yeus yeus yeus
It wasn’t the soul train awards it was just the bet awards.
Black women are so funny. “He’s so generous and kind” totally not caring about how many black men he killed to get the money for her gifts.
You can tell she still loves that man
Outside of the time that they were together at the MTV Awards how come there are no more pictures of them when they were together back in the day? 50 was a mega star when they were dating if they were so serious it should have been more photos of them together.
How to destroy your face......
Haha she looks like alien now haha 🤣
Who’s this woman? This is not my Vivica from the 2000s.
Eyebrows
She lookin like Wendy these days yeesh 😅
Alpha Widow
Zzzzzzzz , who cares
That's why you have to be careful with who you choose. It can effect your career. Vivica dating Fifty messed up her career. He made her look cheap and easy. She never recovered from that relationship, kept going down. Meanwhile, Fifty has successful tv shows and Vivica can barely get an acting gig.   I think he knew his future plans for TV and film...probably used her for knowledge and cat. Those flowers he showered her with was a small investment. New York hustle.
The real story is that Vivica is the one that played 50 ! In the beginning when they start dating Vivica she didn't like 50 like that but her manager told Vivica to play with it for a publicity buzz 50 was the biggest thing coming out in 2003 thats why their relationship was publicly that quick she knew this would be a  benefit for her carreer someone told 50 this and when they was together in a private jet 50 asked her if that rumor was true and she said yes but she told him now that i know you better and i'm spending time with you i really like you 50 couldn't trust her anymore because he knew she was using him in the beginning and he broke up with her 50 was going to propose to her but he changed the diamond ring in to earrings and gave it to her a year later they was back together but 50's baby mother Shaniqua told 50 to break up with her and he did it but i don't know if that part is true she confirmed it in a interview a year ago
She is delusional. She was a pump and dump. A fantasy that 50 fulfilled. Nothing more. She just protecting her ego and public image.
Young Casanova
What a waste of money...a truck load of expensive flowers to impress this woman who revelled in Kevin Samurl's death.
She didn't need fscelifts...only a new personality...saying it was Karma that came for Kevin Samuels (becsuse she didn't LIKE what he SAID). Nasty woman...and the only reason she is not bashing her ex is BECAUSE SHE IS HOPING TO GET BACK WITH HIM.
What killed it was 50 wanting to F any and everything he could and not be tied down to one woman
Damn she gone be sprung forever.
Ughhhhh why she touch her face!!!!
Bitter

She not gon stop either man, she was so gorgeous 🫠😑😔
They said it was evey award show except for the actual award show lol
I just love how Kevin Samuels roasted her ass
All the girls said tht about 50cent 😭😭😭. Literally. I watched the interviews they all love him
She still wanted to do her is what sounds like; you let love of life go because it went to public? Nah CURTIS was not having that ish 😂
I respect her for that sentence alone. I felt it.  But then I listen to her feminist takes and I'm like...Well, nevermind
megan good said this as well
I thought they was only together for 4 months
You have to keep people out of your business. 😄
Very classy beautiful woman 🥰 she keeps it real...
I love her smile
"Let's play a game" face -Jigsaw puppet. Corey Holcomb is the best!!!😆
Those surgeries took the personality right out her face. Now she looks like Carol Channing
False hair, false eyelashes, chopped up face painted with make up!
Every woman who has been in a relationship with 50 cent always proclaimed that he was kind... I wonder why? You can tell a lot about a man the way he treats women and the way women speaks about him!!
He must have that magic stick if she's still talking about him. Kevin was right she looks horribly stitched
She just regret cuz he is still famous and she not that much.
I feel like he just alot younger then her and that's it.
She was his childhood crush lmao he smashed an kept moving lol that's it she needs to get over it. She probably has that shit framed 🤣🤣🤣
Respect 🙏
WOW Hollywood really changes ur face
Vivica why did u touch those pretty face we loved ......oh baby girl.....I loved ur face.
She never got over fif😑
Awwe Viv I'm sure you'll always have a place in his heart!!!
50 went Diamond?
Message to all black women,  please do not follow Veronica Fox standard of beauty with the fake hair and the cumbrella eyelashes in which when study and do your research, you will learn for what they were originally designed and use for, very disgusting purpose.
We had to many people in our business. Translation, I had many people in my ear telling me Curtis is living his best life when your not around/
You loved him but made public accusations about his sexuality. How did the outside influence that. He does not want you, so run along.
I feel that money for all that surgery was wasted money if she can't keep a man lmaooooo
Who cares  😴
Who cares  😴
Who cares  😴
Her face lol
She look so tired ☹️
WTF happended to her face
All those surgeries smh
God bless 🤴🏾Kevin’s Samuels
Fake hair,fake asses, fake eyelashes all this fake crap black women wear, but they  want a real man!🤣🤣🤣
vivica looks like JIGSAW overweight
She look 60 years old still talking about 50 cent 😂
Why she did that to her face 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
Why she sound like a British vampire
She should have left the face shots alone... Was fine as hell back then but now she looks... Bloated.
Wasn't Vivica screwing 50 cent, the same rapper calling women both 304s and b!tches?  How come she didn't hold her boyfriend accountable and cancel him vs Kevin Samuels? What a hypocrite..at least Kevin Samuels held up a mirror to them.  You can't make this ish up!
Wats with the strechy  face 🤮
vivica fox is all that and bag of chips...
Oh wow what she said was so real ❤️ she kept it raw and honest much respect for that
The game " anything is possible if 50 f*** vivica"
What happened to her face???
Black women are some of the strongest and that’s sexy asf
just hate the CERAMIC FACE
BET awards not Soul Train awards what does she think all these awards look the same or something?
This surgery shit ruining natural beautiful women 😑
It's the way she speaks its more of a grandma... your going to eat ALL your vegetables...come on one more bite .
You guys treat her comments like Holy scriptures. Really, it  is nothing more than a press conference.
50 was her chad. he had better options. he ghosted her cause her stank attitude.
Shoulda done it
Everybody loves him
She was performing in a play in my hometown and took a photo with a co-worker of mine. When I saw the photo I realized how beautiful she was off screen. This was back around 2005.
The compliment was at the BET Awards
You can tell fiddy laid some serious pipe down on her
What a lady
Vivica she was a normal looking lady ..but y must she did all thoses surgeries that makes ..her terrible weird looks..y such ..of she cant ages will goes by...it wont make u stop being old remember that natural always the best
Dang she looks horrible, too much work 😳 she look like when she played in “why do fools fall in love” as she got older
wow this is a great person speaking about a great person total Respect.
Vivica if you read this, please let him go and stop talking about this man. You made a mistake by dating him and it's okay. Forgive yourself and move on.
What's so sad is that she is almost 60 years old and have not forgiven herself for dating this man. I believe he humiliated her public and it hard to get over.
She was beautiful, what did she do to herself?   Now guys this is what an “Alpha Widow” is, textbook.
Wow, honestly, I expected that this was going to be a shit talking video, I did not expect for her to refer to "Curtis" as the "love of her life". That was a very respectful thing to do on her part, even if they had issues in their relationship, she held it down in this interview video, much respect for Vivica.
She's an alpha widow, 50 cent still lives in her😂💯
I wish they worked out. Anything is possible. If Ben and Jen could find their way back? It is still possible. Just pray about it. Alot of pple have messed up their rship and didnt know that they lost the right person until its too late. But with God......
I love you Vivica…ok, I really wish she hadn’t altered her lips. They were fine the way they originally were. All she had to do was use those lipsticks that would’ve achieved the same effect. Still gorgeous, strong and sexy though. 😍🥃
Baby she held on to that moment fr🤞🏽🤣
Wow she's definitely not the same woman than before, years of Botox destroyed her face, watching back this tape she was really beautiful.
BEAUTIFUL
50 Cent said somebody told him that it was Vivica's manager idea to start an open relation with 50 for publicity ! Vivica Fox at the time wasn't that relevant anymore and after all that succes 50 made with his first album he was everywhere so 50 asked her about this and she said that it was true that she wasn't really interesting in the begining but after knowing him and spending time with him she fell in love with him 50 couldn't trust her anymore and took the ring he was going to give her took the diamonds out and instead of the ring he made her a pair of earrings
Holy shit. Doesnt even look like the same person. No wonder you and 50 broke up. Humble yourself. Love yourself as is. You changed who you was bc you couldn't accept yourself when he had. That's the problem
Leo shit
Vivica is my crush. I've had it for her for 20 yrs.
I love vivica fox 🦊
It’s all about bold gestures fellas. Well, until y’all get on each other’s nerves. Lol.
Curtis courteous!
Her articulation, honesty and maturity in the way she can talk about this is wow.
Fiddy put da pound game down.
She needs to move on
Unbelievable she still thinking about 50 2021 smh
She was too old for him at the time is the truth.
That surgery it ain't right
I don't approve of her getting all that plastic surgery when she got with 50. I like the original Viv
"With Vivica, I thought I was on to something.... But then the next week, Nah, Man it was nothing..."
At least mature enough to speak highly of a man she still loves yet not in a relationship anymore that s mature love
She in denial......   the relationship stop because you were old as hell.    You wanted a young thing and he wanted you from the movies he saw growing up.  But in reality you don't look like that without make up and you were to old for him.
Her neck still look good Vivica  didn't need that surgery
Dj vlad with his fuckin casting couch voice 😂
50 hit you hard, Viv! Fifty is a nice guy!
She looks completely different... what a shame she had to do all this unwanted botox/surgery stuff to herself. As a woman of colour, you age gracefully and would be rare to have a sagging face, especially if you eat and exercise well. Too bad you can't reverse these procedures and go back to the way you were.
That thug meat turns you crazy
What the F happend to her
How can someone go from so fine to this....she reminds me of a drag queen...ugg
More like plastic surgery...Stop...uh
It is what it is. I always thought it was great sex, not love. He didn't seem like the type to be looking for love at such a huge turning point in his career.
Cue "Magic Stick"
Why do people who have cosmetic surgery have that weird lisp sounding thing to their voice... Creepy AF with that permanent surprise face too
A woman like this has no grasp on how to engage with a person who has come from the bottom.
I love how she's bringing all those things up as a way of arguing how "generous" and "kind" 50 was when all it really showed was how hard 50 was trying to get to smash. Generosity is doing something that leaves you worse off while also not wanting and not expecting any pay off in the future for those actions. That's "generous". But he did those things to get into her pants and be on her good side. Not out of selflessness.
What has she done t her face 🤦🏽‍♂️
When I was with Vivica i thought it was something then the next week...aah man there was nothing
She Looks terrible after all those surgerys
Pathetic
her face giving me the cringed, she didnt need any surgery was already beautiful
Shanaynay telling fibs *
Staying private secures the victory
WOW. she looks horrible. smh.
50 cent is a cancer ♋😌 love charmers
When botox goes wrong ............. reallllll wronggggggggg
The wall is undefeated Father Time ain’t no joke
She used to be so pretty before she got all this stuff done to her face... I don't know why these women do it. 90 % of them don't end up looking better.
Gay
That More, More, More thing came out super strange
she doesnt look like herself i remember her thats not her .. her whole face is different..
she can just about blink bless her
She is sweet very sweet ♥️
damn i think she needs more surgery . too bad she was pretty too
She destroyed her face.
Living proof that pretty doesn’t equal the outcome you want… she needs to sit down with Kevin Samuels. Girl literally ruined her face to look better too
She's really aging. Got damn! What's going on with her face!
Her doctor used the same mold he used for Lil kim.
It really is a thing when a woman hits the wall. Ladies listen to your grandma if you still have here, that’s the last generation...
I told myself, to NOT come back and support this platform, any longer...BUT...I was coming from the damn movies seeing the PIPING-HOT, new "Snake Eyes"-backstory chumpy; and, I was talking with my brother about how Vivica's character got MURKED, in "Kill Bill".  That led me down a rabbit hole, as to what HAPPENED with her, after she and 50 Cent broke up: it went downhill, and QUICKLY...!!  Open my YouTube page, this very morning:  ...I blame, the nanobots :0)..................NO "lol"-ing...
She just played the shit outta the BET awards
Did she get work done on her lips?
She and Lil Kim must have the same low budget plastic surgeon.. he uses recycled water bottles for surgeries.. as in plural. Lol
Owk wat happened to her face ?🙆🏿‍♂️
She likes attention.
She’s definitely wifey. Unfortunately the next husband ain’t her #1 draft pick. I see you tho sis!! Out here making that LMN money!!
She's not even the same Person
Been watching her old movies and she's  a proper actress  My goodness her scenes are just proper.  just awsome
Who cares go back to the toaster put it on high.
sex got dull and they had little in common. duh
Why does her face look so stiff and puffy??
Why does her face look so stiff and puffy??
Vivica really was the epitome of beauty. Somebody must have lied to her or not complemented her enough.  She looked better without plastic surgery
That was the first DM in history
The face is so pulled up!!!😖
Megan good said fif is the love of her life too damn what fif be doing to these females
This lady messed her face up smfh
Didn't 50 dump her on the radio, and her friend told her about it? And that's the love of her life? When she got her face chopped, the doc must've carved too deep and hit brain.
Dam.. she looking ruff..surgery no good..
Very beautiful women. No reason to do that to her face
She looks scary asf😭
Wow, that has got to be the saddest thing I have read about a woman pinning over someone in a very long time. I’m glad my father raised me well and schooled me on men. Curtis aka 50 cent love bombed her and she was vulnerable and feel for it hook line and sinker. The fact that she says this man is the love of her life says a lot about her own self esteem and values. This is a man that never married her, a man that loved bombed her and dump her and has trashed her for over a decade. Here’s what I think: Vivica has created a fantasy version of Curtis that she can always come back to in her mind. She has placed him on a pedestal he never belonged and she can always escape to her fantasy to ESCAPE HER REAL LIFE. This has NOTHING to do with reality, this is a romance novel escapist fantasy so she can cope with whatever is missing in her life. I say this as someone who was once doing this with a man that didn’t deserve it, but he was someone I could pull up in my mental Rolodex to escape from what was missing in my life. It was only after I found my soul mate, found the true love of my life, married him and heard him commit to me for life in front of family and friends that I got it. And all those dusters vanished into thin air and I lived my life.  Vivica will continue to replay this small chapter in her life and create the fake fantasy with Curtis until she really faces her emotional issues and vulnerabilities and finds someone who truly loves her and appreciates her. This is an example to all black women of what not to do. This relationship was a speed bump to this man and he has moved on, but she is still retelling it because it is a fantasy she can cling to and it is not healthy. It is like a woman who reads romance novels every day instead of having a healthy balanced relationship in the real world. Shame on the media world for exploiting this for clicks. The entire topic is pointless and it is at the expense of mocking Vivica’s emotional issues. She deserves compassion and understanding. It is hard to be a black woman in today’s society with the microscope always in your face judging you. I wish her well…
“ She don’t look anything like “ I WANNA THANK VIVICA FOX FOR WEARING THAT DRESS TOO “
Vivica looking like someone who recovered from facial injuries/scars after all those surgeries
50 just wanted to hit a famous chick. He didn't want no relationship. Ray Charles could see that
Now years later Vivica is still thinking about him. What happened should've been kept under wraps PERIOD!! Now he's moved on and she's still lookin' (somewhat). Be patient Vivica be patient.
Duuuuude... the surgeries are messing with my health looking at her...  She was top 5 hottest on the planet at some point
TALK ABOUT DELUSIONAL
She use to be hating on him hella much back in the day...i guess she finally got over it lol
That shot he fired at the Award show didn't just hit the target it destroyed the whole platform, recoded her DNA and stopped her growth emotionally. 50 showed us how to get the love of your life. Blow her away. Too bad they didn't work. That should be a story you tell your kids and grandkids.
She made me wanna rob banks pretty women😍
She is washed up and he moved to a younger women.
Funny how women think you’re “such a gentleman” when you’re generous & spend you hard-earned money on them, but when she was spending money on her own husband, she felt he was a scrub, & ungentlemanly because he was allowing her to pay for things? Can’t she be a respectable lady as well if she spends on men? Or that should be discussed because she’s a woman?  So a guy of means who takes his personal finances & budget very seriously isn’t a “gentleman”, because he doesn’t want tosplurge and indulge you in all the nonsense ideals that popular media has taught women to believe is the true definition of what a gentleman is?
Respect earned.... Some may think  this does emanate from the woman's honesty... Naaan, aint... this is called the manhood trace and effect... Way to go my boy Curtis!
I know her from 1-800 missing sadlyI didn't like her character
People are waking up!   We see you!
Dude look like a lady.  Boy Boy Boy. LOL. Hollyweird.  Its all lies!
Damn yo it was the B.E.T AWARDS. the black man dont get no love. 😂😂😂😂
Sad to see her with that plastic surgery 🤦🏾‍♂️she used to be beautiful SMDH..
Coz he likes it in the bak door
Man, she was such a beauty, why did she event considered plastic surgery ;(
The I hate that our women feel they need to be fake to succeed-
I thought it was the BET Awards
50 said they only dated for three months.
Typical celebrity couple 🙄
It was actually the BET Awards were 50 said the comment about her dress
"He's the love of my life."  Bitch , you look like a statue after all that work on your face.
She’s beautiful
Yeah she was crazy about 50 cents. I remember when 50 cent put that restraining order on her when I was living in Connecticut that was announced on the radio at that time 50 cent was residing in Connecticut.  I would not bother having this conversation about 50 cent.
Damn she still glows when his name is spoke❤️
I could see her saying this if 50 was single but he’s in a whole relationship and she’s saying this?
If she let's some of the botox wear off and the eyebrows lower she'd look more natural. She still beautiful.
Vivica is a good actor 👏.  She played this interview
She messed herself up 🤦🏿‍♂️
I don't remember her voice being this deep.
Noooi... she does not look better than before the surgery
Wow
She's too much. Fake as a 7 dollar bill and more plastic than DuPont
Appreciate her honesty about their relationship… They would’ve matched Will & Jada as a Black Power Couple that everyone loves
Maaan Viv did not have to mess with her face . She was stunning . Her or Jada, just age gracefully! I love my Boo Viv tho ! 😊😊
Celebrities start a trend between themselves with plastic surgeries that just becomes stupidly obsessive and ruins their physical appearance.
I appreciate her vulnerability. She was so crazy for him. Saying he was the love of her life is wild because I remember she was married before. Her wedding was even shown on Oprah... wonder what happened to that guy
Don’t even look like her anymore
BEAUTIFUL BLACK WOMEN, STOP F'N UP YOUR FACES AND BODIES. YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE...
I didn’t know she had surgery. I just thought she was getting older
That's SO RARE,ACTUALLY UNHEARD-OF, for a woman to say that and not be genuine after a relationship goes bad,GOOD FOR YOU VIVICA
She lookin bad now. 50 don't want you stop embarrassing yourself.
She got all that surgical crap done she’s a very beautiful woman I don’t like that she did that to her FACE
why the fillers man i mean Vivica was always beautiful she is pretty now but without the fillers she would've looked so much better,  and also wasn't it BET awards not Soultrain ?
"He's very generous" Basically she meant he's rich and he spent a lot of money on me I felt validated
City boyz up 1 million
Damm 50 cents in Australian is different to 50 in USA 🇺🇸 Damm girl Damm he’s probably buddies name 32 cents or ten bucks 💴 Damm and in this video you smile girl 👧 🔥👁🔥
Vivica is beautiful and smart. The thing is after this interview she needs to stop talking about 50 in reference to love. No guy is going to want to date you if they feel like you are still in love with your ex. They don’t want to compete with your ex. There are men out there who want to be with you and reciprocate the love. Start saying you are open to love again and willing to receive your Boaz instead. This confession will bring him to you. He does exist. We all want you to be happy. Story: There was a relative of Naomi’s husband, a man of great wealth, of the family of Elimelech. His name was Boaz. So Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, “Please let me go to the field, and glean heads of grain after him in whose sight I may find favor.” And she said to her, “Go, my daughter.” Then she left, and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers. And she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech. Now behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, “The Lord be with you!” And they answered him, “The Lord bless you!” Then Boaz said to his servant who was in charge of the reapers, “Whose young woman is this?” Ruth 2:1-5
She kept it real sorry this happened and leave your face alone
Ladies you’re beautiful leave the surgery alone! Embrace the age and beauty
Boy why the hell did she get any surgery!? Like she looks bad and old and black ain’t supposed to crack! 😩😩😩
I see a ton of surgery wtf did she do that for? Lol but she is a very respectable woman, 50 probably just wasn't ready for her maturity
They were only together for 3 weeks it seems. It wasn't a long relationship at all. How does she considers him the love of her life? Vivica is funny😂😂😂
Fillerca A Botox
ewww
I pushed like for charity
I want to see her WITHOUT ALL THE MAKE-UP, WEAVE and other ADD-ON'S! NATURAL BEAUTY is the BEST...
Old ass news who cares let it go look forward
So sad 😭 wow
she was so pretty....at her peak.
I love her
I wish she would of never messed her face up. She still looks good sometimes. Today is not one of those day though. Her cheeks are stuck. Please no more. You are already gorgeous Queen. Love you on lifetime these days
Vlad please let the interviewee speak.. smh
why did she get surgery?? she looked better without it wtf.
Why did she go to plastic gezzz. She was so beautiful
“I know him as Curtis, Always will!” I hear you Sis lol.
Damn Vivica fell off is she on here 😂
In OTHER words, “I let outsiders effect my mindset on OUR relationship and I ENDED up paying the price by getting dumped publicly!”
If y’all don’t stop talking about Vivica getting surgery. She did it and it’s done. Get over it! Most celebrities get work done they don’t need but she wanted to and her spirit and Ora is what makes her pretty. And she was ASKED about Fifty, she didn’t bring it, he did. She just answered the question. ‼️
She was/is trying to make herself relevant again.  When they 1st broke up she was dissing him.
It was at the BET AWARDS NOT THE SOUL TRAIN AWARDS , SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER, HE WAS TEARING THAT SHIT UP WHEN VIVICA STILL HAD IT. SHE STILL CAN GET IT,  BUT SHE HAD MAD SURGERY DONE. U CAN SEE SHE HAD A FACE LIFT OR A WHOLE LOTA BOTOX, LIPO AND OTHER SHIT  WHAT FEMALES ARENT GETTING SURGERY NOWADAYS FAKE ASSES, LIPS, TITTS, EVERYONE WANTS THAT FAME. VIVICA'S SURGERY U CAN TELL OFF THIS INTERVIEW.
She said nothing wrong, 50 also agreed with her. You all are just full of drama
Get over him already.
“I hit vivica first, can you believe it?! Huhuhaha 😁”  - Gianni Russo
I can truly respect the fact that she came out and said she loves that man till this day! Must respect Vivica 🙌 💙
Why are you still talking about him?
Dam sis your face don’t move at all girl Nothing from her face moved in looks like she’s struggling to move her mouth you could tell your age buy your neck your hands your knees your feet and according to Google
I was the BET awards
She was full of herself and delusional. The reason her relationship, if she wants to see it as that, didn't work out with 50 Cent is because he was becoming a super male celebrity. Too much temptation at that point to be seriously involved with anyone at that time. Too many women coming from too many angles. Sorry.
She miss what 50 used to do for her....In all her other Relationships she's was the Suga Mama who pay for Everything...She never had a Man Spend his Own Money on her 😁...She used to dating men like Nicki Minaj Husband,buy her stuff with her Money and say he Bought it 😎
What is that vivaca fox i know that clip when 50 said that on mtv but she dont look like that girl
A little obsessive
Vivica Fox why the hell u mess your face up so bad!! You were always fine as hell! Damn, what a waste!!
The relationship could never have lasted with you looking like that
SHE LOOKS AWFUL....why? why? why? did you get plastic surgery VIVICA???? GEEEEEEEEEZE!!!  You looked so amazing and now your face looks sooo stuck! Dang.😬
That's the downfall of cancer men too caring, generous..always get taken advantage by women.
Child, if that was the love of her life, I def. wouldn’t want to cross across any of the other men she was involved with. The way 50 dogged her ..........
Does anyone care about these two?
Shout out to 50 in vivica Fox
Her surgery 😷 🤮
POLICE VLAD. STILL AT IT WITH THE INTEROGATIONS NOT INTERVIEWS LOL. Vivica need to go COPPER HEAD ON VLAD KILL FUCKIN BILL STYLE.😏
Who’s this? Where’s vivica?
She now looks like a puppet and she really didn’t need to do this! I still think she’s a legend but I’m sorry she felt this was necessary!
50 didn’t need her
Vivica, you are  a beautiful woman. You always have been. Thankyou for speaking your truth. Thankyou for your body of work. You have blessed this world with your talent. We love your grace and wisdom.. May we be honored as I graciously show you the resoect for what you have given us. And I know 50 is happy to hear your words . What a blessinig  to be a beacon of unconditional ...love and humility. God bless you queen.
Everyone loves 50
“The love that I had for him, and still to this day, will always—he was the love of my life. I will admit that without any reservations. He will always have a special place in my heart.”  😂😂😂😂😂 She s still trying to get that bag.
She was such a beautiful woman, whoever did that hatchet job to her face should be in prison
Damn glad! You got a breeze right over what Chris rock said at those music awards, “50 Cent is up in here with Vivica Fox?? don’t you know that’s like hearing about the dealership giving away free Bentleys the day after! “😂
50 cent recently said he wanted to be with her, but she had industry people in her ear saying he was a bad look for her! Yet she doesn't mention that in why he didn't go through with the proposal, because she still wanted to "follow her dreams" and didn't want a "industry thug" to ruin her career. Now she wants to say 17 years later, that he was her soulmate and they belonged together. Why wasn't he that years ago?
Time to age gracefully and stop chasing that man. She looks pathetic. He doesn’t mention her name. He probably feels sorry for her. I know l do (on occasion) 😊
No vivica, why,why?
He dog walk her ..lol then he said her pussy wack and he only dated her 3 months how dumb
Vivica mustve been listening to Kevin Samuels, sounds like she's trying to get back! Lol
Timeless beauty classy lady
50 took over the rap game in 2003
dude got bored and dumped her unceremoniously, who said these bitchez ain't loyal.....
She still sprung!!!!
She looks jittery as fuck, plus the surgeries. ill
This how you ruin your face 💉 even the mf voice changed 🥴
She used to be beautiful, without surgery
Vivica ready to set it off
Another strong independent lonely miserable woman
The cap is strong in this one...lol
Botched
_"He was the love of my life"_   Yet she proceeds to insinuate his suspected homosexuality on another platform.
Too much cosmetic surgery. U so beautiful naturally . U dont need all that.
Dont get me wrong everyone in the set it off was beautiful but she was the baddest and most fine one there😭😍
Why doesnt she stop talking about this man, he is way over relationship.
I love vivica, she seems very nice
She sounding desperate for a man yesh smh
50 cent made that comment at the BET awards wasn’t it? She said the Soul Train Awards
Her husband must feel like he the 17th draft pick!
Girl bye 20 years later !!!!!!!
😂😂😂
Chile Ciara use too say the same thing about 50 even Megan good dated him and said Curtis was the sweetest in their relationship. But why doesn’t it ever last tho
Vivica please stop with the injections ...you was always pretty now you look like Dolly P......smh....CAN EVERYBODY JUST GROW OLD GRACEFULLY 🤷🏽‍♀️
She is wayyyyy past her prime. She would have got 50 when she was in her 20’s  . Ladies you wasted your prime and then want men when you’re in you’re late 30’s, and 40’s .  Fifty is looking for a a young woman now not Viva Fox .
Surgery ruined her face 😐
Vlad is getting better and better at getting people to talk😂😂
50 & Vivica are gonna get back with each other when they're in their 70s lol.
I applaud her honesty and we can’t help who we love (I suppose) but this relationship would have never worked, public or not. Fifty isn’t mature in his mid 40’s, I can’t imagine the man child he was 20 years ago.
Bet awards @vladtv
She messed her face up 🤦🏾‍♂️
Ppl quit hating shes extraordinarily beauty always!
Damn she would have looked fine withour the surgery. She looks like a characature of herself.
Click bait
It's because 50 is a high value man and she still hasn't met a man that can compete with his resume. Respect to Mr. Jackson for such a skillset of mind control.
Remember how bad she was before the surgery?!?!!?
When she said "love of my life".... n he played it down by saying they were only together for 3 or 4 months that made me feel for her. She might've never experienced a certain kind of dude b4.
She looks like a man and sounds like one
Vivica move on for gods sake...gee
Melissa Ford also said that 50 cent is "a gentleman, & all in all a really great guy.
50 said the comment about Vivica’s dress at the 2003 BET Awards
I know she did the grown up thing by showing him love even now....but I'll be DAMNED! before I show love to a brute who dragged my ass like a corpse....no sir!  if we cool....there will be a peace treaty package This includes...hey...what's up...while I  walk d hell on How u doin...and I walk the hell on...  I will not cuss your ass out every time I see u ( this is largely dependent on me walking the hell off when I see u)  2 general compliments if need be N finally .... should u burst into flames I shall spit on u exactly once before calling 911  If this treaty is violated we will be moving to the Scorpio package...where u cease to exist for all eternity...  Its good to forgive...but when you do it first sometimes the other person takes the opportunity to be mean ... After all this he said...I don't pay attention when she says things...hmmm....wish her well at least don't twist d knife
Surgery done fucked you up dam why why why
50 is a real man, you can be a man and a simp
Man! Vivica didn't need any surgery. She should have just hooked up with a nutritionist and combine it with exercise. She's naturally pretty.   I hate when Hollywood gets in their head but I get it. Damn! I don't think some of these icons appreciate how much genuine love fans have for them. She earned the right to age gracefully.
Just goes to show that women don't know what's good for them. Vivica Fox is naturally beautiful.  Why did she see the need to fill her lips and blow up her face, making her look like a poor copy of Vivica?   She needs to take a cue from Gabrielle Union.
WTF happened to her face???
It ended cuz u told ppl u ate his ass n was bein a clown Vivica stop lien ho
Stop commenting on women’s alterations on there bodies then saying why? Because u bastards. Are in constant judgement of them … she’d be old, aging like wine, cheese, milk, etc if she didn’t or at least that’s how she feels. I imagine
Why are we still talking about this relationship?
Did she think Jim Carrey’s mask really gave you powers?
Her face is a mess
What has she done to her face?...
The pressure that Hollywood puts on women doesn't allow for them to fully see their beauty. Its so sad. I wish someone would ban elective plastic surgery.
I want them back together highkey 🎉💥💫🎈🖤
The love of her life? Back in my day, they called that being “turned out”
Bet awards! she said soul trian or maybe I am wrong.
She's still speaking about 50 🤦🏿‍♀️
"All that and a bag of chips..." please move on Vivica ... from a lot.
Respects to this beautiful black woman. She kept it all the way honest, nothing but respect.
Sprung
Ts madison hey girllllll
she used to be so hot.. Watch '2 can play that game'
The plastic surgery....is all i see vivica ..
Part 15 😭😭😭😭
I didn’t know her face before - she’s pretty and well spoken.
Lol....even if they stayed together. he would have dumped her anyway.  The wall is undefeated😆 😅 😂
I hate that she did the surgeries she was naturally beautiful 😢😢😢
Why does she keep shaking her head like she has Tourette’s
Way to public way to fast 💯💯 facts
I can probably guess he still fuckin’ her tho. Why would she say this 18 years later. 🤔
A beautiful soul and a wonderful actress.🌹
Damn out of all these years he’s still the love of her life 🤦🏾‍♂️ she clearly fail for 50 game
🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
She loved him, 50 should reconcile and have her in his life.
(VIVICA PLEASE STOP DOING THING TO YOUR FACE.)!!!!! You already (BEAUTIFUL)!!!!!  So (STOP) with all the other (BULLSHIT)!!!!! You going to (FAR)!!!!!!
That had to be 20 years ago geez
Wait this is recent and she still on 50 jock? That borders on cray cray
She'll never be shit to another guy...... get them young so you'll be that guy
As Kevin Samuels says “You can’t make this shet up!😆
At least she keeping it 💯
Damn Indy has some Baaaad Sisters 💯
When is vivca not crying now. She has falls in love a lot
I respect her honesty  and the humbleness she speaks on the relationship they had.
Shoutout to Jamira (cuban link) and thanks for whatever you got on today ;) haha
Wow she looks horrible.
they dated like 2005 who cares??? 😒
Kind of favor windy Williams now. 🤣
Vivica is damn near 60 yrs old and is pining for a man who mistreats and disrespect women who look like her.  Make it make sense.  If Vivica was white then maybe she got a fighting chance...but 50 has nothing but contempt for black women.
Who is this man
Her interview was very sweet. I like that she didn’t bash him at all
I think they might get back together now  That would be nice
Omg why is she still talking about him smh 🤦‍♀️
Lord, did she get plastic surgery?
Damn Vivica was gorgeous naturally, she ruined it. Why do you females keep doing this shit to yourselves?
Why don’t we have a FULL INTERVIEW yet ?? Wtf
The wall is serious
She was the sexiest black woman before she ruined herself 😬
in the words of frozen “LET IT GOOOOO!!!”❄️
She miss that money
In my language we have a saying that says "Don't make a murder pit of your heart". Well done Vivica for being this strong woman that speaks her truth.
Look at every other testimonial of the women he's been with. Ciara said the same thing. Meagan Good, Karlie Redd, Chelsea Handler...  Five is really good with the ladies. He even gets along with babymama, Daphne Joy. That's admirable.
Surgery messed up a pretty face
Stop saying he's the love of your life.  You were out of his league then and you are out of his league now.
Vivica: 50 cent is the luv of my life.  YouTubers: We don’t care
Sure looks like Charlamagne sister.  CTGoddess?
She clearly had work
She just wanted a celebrity ro go out with and it didnt pan out. Noe she is alpha widowed and no man wants to deal with this mess
She needs to go on Iyanla Fix My Life !
Vivica or not... She has lost her Mables This was 18 years ago...y is she still talking about him n he is being so mean to her every chance he gets...he does not deserve for her to speak his name...well that was my little 2 cents no one asked me for
She still talking about this? My Lord let it go...seriously...it's sad.
Insecurities stole her beauty.
Women. If you're already beautiful. Don't get shit done. Because without the make-up you end up looking like you went 8 rounds with Mike Tyson.
"Yesb, yesb."
Vlad has good interview content...but why does he always brings up old negative sh"t? its like reviving old 🐄...
That's not her is. Whoever this person is it cant be Vivica. Something's wrong with her face.
Love of her life what!!!?
This is obsession is unhealthy 🤦🏽‍♂️
50 was rich n pounded her out real good,,then dropped her seems like for really no reason..and she needs closure and answers thats why she thinks shes still in love n always brings him up every so often....
I wish she should stop talking about a man who had no regard for her!
When u rich wemen are like hmmm come over here haha she still love 50 cent
Why in the hell she is still talking about this man? Its been over like a 100 years already leave him out of your life chicka🤦
She is in her mid 50's and still talking about 50 cent.  Move on with your life. No guy would want to deal with a girl like that.
Speaking her Truth , She did Truly love that Man... wish u all the best in your FUTURE Relationship
Vivca has  a love jones for 50,girl that was  eons ago,If 50 felt the same he would be with you,It's  🕛 to move on. ....
Unfortunately, Vivica should have let her relationship with him slow burn instead of full speed ahead. He was young and still in a mind set of seeing what's out there and running through whatever he found and fame. She is far more respectful toward him than he is regarding her.
That’s not what killed the relationship lmao. Delusional. He’s a man child and has spoken so much shit about her publicly.
True Talk!! God bless you for being open and straightforward  - people come and go in our lives but some people leave their "footprint" all over our hearts eternally!  It's real Guys !
Vivica’a face is ugly as hell. What happened?
I don’t recognize her anymore. She looks like someone else.
Prime reason why I'am a savage.  So many dudes will suffer because of 50 Cent and his imprint trying to mess with her.  Women like her always obsess over the dudes dropped them like a bad habit, while fucking over the dudes who pick up then pieces.
This broad needs to get over it & should have moved on years ago.
🥴
We all got that girl even after years you still can hit that shit🔥
50 u lucky bastard
We need another word for "embarrassing" at this point... Vivica it was 18 YEARS ago! and u only dated him for a few months. And he trashed you several times on social media... U sound ridiculous and desperate! As Wendy Williams said by saying all of this you're also potentially blocking other men from coming your way... Honesty is not always good and now you're just showing everyone that u're kinda crazy. What grown self-respecting woman would stay stuck on someone she dated almost 20 years ago only for a few months?
Her face looks tight.
She truly Loves him and I hope she can move on
There is a thing like a first love even if you move on you will hold a piece of who you think was your first love even if he didn’t feel the same
All pussy feels the same and gives u the same headache!!that’s why fif said next week it was nothing .... remeber that fellas
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Move on sweetie!!!
Them eye brows🤣😅😂🤣🤣🤣
Look like she cant blink or something
She jacked her face up😕
Why does she sound like she's speaking as if she is a royal queen sitting on a plastic chair lol.... "YES, I DO RATHER OFTEN" LMAO I LOVE YOU THO VIVICA
..she’s tha elephant lady now...
Dam, she FUCKED up her face. As old as she is no wrinkles on her forehead, no Grey hair?? Come on.
😭😭🤣😂
Wasn't it the bet awards
Who would mess with the most beautiful face in Hollywood?  I hate she let a man turn her into a groveling fool. This was Vivica A. Freaking Fox. She was the bomb. Damn.
I THINK SHE LOVE THE MONEY.  BUT 50 WASN'T NO FOOL FOR HER
It’s sad she destroyed her face like this 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
50 put her through that surgery she probably thought she wasn’t pretty
Heres the truth, Fitty got with her in good intentions... Then 🤔💭 "Hell Im finally bout to be a Mega super star".... "Do I really want to be lockdown"...  "Matter of fact let me make some bank on way the out"..🤷🏽‍♂️
And I'm going to be honest with you guys... When 50 said that I said oh lord watch we hear they dating. Well I was almost right. lol He got it and didn't want IT no more. lol
She still in Love with him and that will never change too bad things didn't work out between them.
I really don't see how that relationship would have worked anyway.  50 was just starting to pop off and all those groupies would have been a major problem for Vivica.  Its definitely one of those relationships Vivica can say she had the ride of her life.
50 the goat Vlad accept it
No the reason..  why you broke up is because he was not feeling you like that that’s why...
It's best to keep people out your relationship especially when it can be heaven on Earth with your man or woman 💘💖💞💘
When I seen her face I had to go back when 50 cent took his shot and how nice fox looked then she gone old boy
J
Maybe the relationship ended  because Vivica  linked his ass then tried to kiss him afterwards....
Vlad has made a career on the name of 50 cent. I think 50 either done something really bad to this guy he is overly obsessed with 50 cent wtf
I would love to see her and 50 try it again, but if that doesn't happen, Ms. Vivica it is time to hang it up. Give another great man a try. Sometimes men need to see you happy with someone else.
The more public your relationship is going the faster it’ll tend to end. Keep your shot private, be consistent and be humble.
I have a feeling she has a masculine energy hidden in her and that’s why she can’t keep a man. Like most modern women have.
When you realize at the time Fox neared 40 years of age, and Curtis Jackson was in his mid-20s.... 🤔🤔🤔..... I'm thinking 50 hit her with that  "just a lil bit" and she got hooked. SMH
VLAD why she on her tho???
Vhlad still doing videos??? I thought by trying to diss em he was done!! Keep lord Kumar out bro, nobody like that punk hater.
She was beautiful before the crap she did with her face
She's got a a voice of a 70 year old woman
She hit her prime in the late 1990s, he hit his prime about 10 years later.
Wait...she was impressed by him on a comment about her 👗..? Oh Lord 🙄
I've said it before and I'm gonna keep saying it; it's giving obsessed. Her honesty isn't shit she should be proud of. They dated over a decade ago and she needs to move tf on already and leave the past where it is. In addition to it being unhealthy, it's disrespectful to his current girlfriend.
I love her but I wish they would stop talking about this relationship. He did her dirty so many times not to mention they were only together for like 3 months. It looks desperate
I remember it being the B.E.T awards
Boy....why did she stretch her face?? 😳😳😳😳
I couldn’t date a woman that thinks of another man as the love her her life, let me know if you’re not over a ex so I know not to take you seriously lol
That's wsup vivica! She kept it gangsta! Much Respect ta vivica! 👓
I mean it was a good thing for a minute but let’s be honest. 50 was in his late 20’s.. still very young. Vivica was in her early 40’s at the time. That relationship never was gonna last long.
50 cent did not go 💎. stop telling lies. shaggy did ... nelly went really close but get rich and die trying sold 8 million records
🤣🤣🤣
That was BET awards 03 ‘ when he said that. That was the best award show that summer ! 💜
Ill 🤒 🤢🤮
He played the sh*t outta her though!! He must definitely got the magic stick lol 😂 all these years later and she’s still stuck!! Wow
Let it go girl let it go
Didn't 50 say she tried to get mfs to beat his ass n all this shit lmao
She reminds me of someone who I know who is cool but a psychopath. Wait, im a psycho too
3 Months????? And he is the "Love Of Your Life"? Adds a new meaning to "Hit It And Quit It".....
This is quite interesting the fact that she still loves him
She thought she had options back then, as a nationally known actress. She was already established, and she couldn’t handle the public perception, so like most women, she left. Now she’s older, not the hot thing on screen anymore, and regretting that move to end it with 50. 50 didn’t give two fucks about what people say, he had a women that most men valued at that time. He’s been holding shit down financially, and his wealth has surpassed hers, and NOW, he was the love of her life. FOH  Stay on your purpose Men.
“If (I) was to have a chance to do it over..” Sounds Iike Vivica just tossed up a March Madness buzzer beater
I don’t know if she got a man now but if she does, I won’t be surprised if he’s deuces ✌️ .... certain things you keep to yourself
WHEN I WAS WAS VIVICA THEN THE NEXT WEEK AHHH NAH, IT WAS NOTHIN 😂😂😂
I like her ❤
Omg I love her but the botox and surgeries done took over. She can’t react to anything correctly lol
Most of these famous woman have their self-esteem on the floor.. I've had the sexiest guys and once they did me dirty I became repulsed by them. You disrespect me and you're out the door. I never understand women who try to earn the love of a man who doesn't want it. 50 cent humiliated her when he dumped her and humiliated her in a song and I believe he's called her old or whatever. Yet he still has a "special" place in her heart?! I don't know if it's daddy issues or something else, but get it together Vivica. She could have done so much better beautiful as she was, now she's past her prime.
I'm so shock that 10 plus mins of her interview was about a disrespectful ex❓😕
Maybe they should try again
If you ever ever loved a man who treated you that horrible girl you need therapy for the rest of your life.  Geez THAT IS JUST DESPERATE!!
She really did damage to her God giving beauty with the Plastic Surgery. No Bueno
50 it's still yours if you'll have me back,i'll drop all this baggage for you daddy!
50 said he had to go cause she start looking like a actual fox too many surgeries she sophisticated though still got love for Vivica
Y’all are taking her words out of proportion. She’s not in love with 50 she’s saying she has love for him no matter what because they used to be in love. She’s over him. Y’all are childish.
She's ah real one. Notice she didn't speak bad on him. True Black 👑👸🏾
Why did she have to do plastic surgery mara????????
Extravagant displays of affection and flattery is a red flag for me; especially when the relationship is new. It’s nice , but I prefer subtle more meaningful approach like making time during a busy schedule or watching a movie they don’t like just because I like it.
she comes across so full of it
she should of stayed wit carlton
All that surgery got her talking weird lol smh
Interesting. I guess I would have to be in that situation to understand. However, if you claim someone is the love of your life and he felt the same, I would think you would find a way to work through it. I get that she states he holds a special place in her heart, but it's what she's not going to say that was the real issue. Sounds like sides were taken and they couldn't come to an understanding that would allow them to work past it. Simple as that. Had nothing to do with going public too fast.   That's like saying you moved too fast in a relationship, but the two of you want the same things, but really don't. That's what causes the break-up. Otherwise, you can come to an agreement and understanding to slow things down and work through whatever issues moving too fast has caused, if the BOTH honestly feel the other is the love of their life.
I want to thank her too for wearing that dress but wtf happen to her face
Why did Vivica messed up her face my girl was so beautiful 🙄🙄
50, Curtis whatever you wanna call him is far from attractive!  She downgraded with him
Fifty put the work in on her lay the pipe down dude is all in her head and it's been over 10 yrs
The wall is undefeated
Fifty must have knocked the lining out that kitty 🐈
All that surgery FKED UP her face WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!😮😳
Damn she use to be so beautiful smh wtf happen
50cent voice Gggggg mix
Yeah da buoy 50 ditched after he banged.🧐
She was imprinted by him. Hahaha
How about this ...I go get married to a women....and then...do an interview about how I love my ex and how she was the love of my life..... guaranteed the new women would want a divorce...and she is probably giving dating advice to other women who have bs relationships...smh. if she loved 50 so much then why did she disrespect him to the point where he clowned her for years....and she never said shyt about why he was clowing.... another damn fool.
Words are important. "HAVE" loved him she says smh
christ above, what the hell happened to her face? Why did she do plastic surgery crap? She WAS so beautiful
Yes (in my vivica fox voice)
She’s ugly now with that surgery
Girl....You loved a man that thought of you as a TRICK!
He could still hit that if he wanted to.
When they say "alpha widow" THIS is EXACTLY what they're talking about. This is the definition right here.
It's the Same o'l BS with these Modern day BW. Fox has hit the Wall And she's in regret because she blew it with 50..... And she knows she won't get another Man on his level. Us Men judge Woman on their Sexual Marketplace value! not Money ( Beauty, Feminity, Cooperation, Womb, Youth)
She's nutz 🤣
RIP to Vivica Prior to surgery! She was a beautiful women! May she Rest In Peace! 🪦
If only people would speak their truth from their heart. And the person whom holds that place in their heart feels the same way. It's possible everybody would be with their true soulmate.
It's only a matter of time before 50 get that "Hey big head" text from her
You still wilding B after all theses years dam, love can be MF!!!
Plot twist: she would look badder without the work done
That's Not "What Killed The Relationship"... What Killed The Relationship Was, You Wanted To Be A "I Don't Need No Man", "Strong And Independent" Black Woman.. So? He Gave You Your "Independence"... It's Over.. Let It Go.. You Screwed Over A LOT Of Brothers You Thought You Were To Good For.. I'll See You In The Next Movie.. 🤔🤔🤔😂😂😂😂😂😂 YEAH RIGHT!!! You Screwed Over The Studios Too.. I Forgot About That...   The Thing About Life Is? It's A ONEWAY STREET.. With Very Few U-Turns.. But? You Burned The Bridges You May Have Been Able To Go Back Over.. And? There Are No New Bridges For You To Cross.. So? I'd Suggest You Stay On The Road You're On And Don't Look Back.. Because There's Nothing Behind You.. Good Luck In Your Future Endeavors.. Jus Sayin.. Yep...
If she gets another face lift she won’t be able to blink. 😬😬
Imagine dating someone who eventually gets plastic surgery on they whole face , shit must be hella wierd even lookin at her nowadays for 50 frfr
Am I missing something, how do you break up with the love of your life 🤔
He played her.. got the puss and leave
Atleast shes not bitter thankgod for that god bless you Vivica keep doin your thing 50 respect
I’m glad she was honest and instead of not taking accountability. Some women always blame the man instead of saying they faults
It sounds crazy but a lot of people say you should go with the one who likes you rather than go for the one you want.
Bitch it’s been 20 years let that shit go 😂😭
Girl that was 18 years ago . Let it goooooo
She kept saying he very generous  Lol 😆 🤣 😂  if you street then you know what that means 😉 🤣
😂
Why does she remind me of Wendy Willilams
Her face don't look that bad to be seeing all these comments.  And I'm glad she finally admitted it. She won't let him go.
Very honest and beautiful❤️
Does anyone really believe he was the “love”           Of her life?  Come on
Omg she doesn’t look like herself 🥺
Vivica Fox looks like Charlamagne Da God. Is that Charlamagne Da God with a Wig??? 😂
She look horrible with all that Botox
Vivica is so gullible. If a man complimenting you makes you fall immediately in love with him that means you're not used to being hit on.
Her saying she would always love 50 cent and that he is the love of her life despite everything, 50 would have just married this woman..
It's been 15 plus years and he has muddied the water with her in it Girl I wouldn't let this come out my mouth. You should keep this to yourself.... Therapy works
50 imprinted her ass 😂 got dugged out
She a real one tho, didn't take the road to slander the Black man
Why is her voice so deep 😂
Frankie!
He seen her whole scalp in the bathroom and was like nah I gotta find the chick that was originally attached to 💀
CURTIS!!!! "Jim Jones Voice" 🤣🤣🤣
She never quite did it for me... I don’t know why.
Yes.
he got shot 9 times all in his mouth and shit for snitching big facts
notice he picks who he does that clown shit to and it's usually someone he's been in a compromising situation with let's name a few suspects buck,game,Ross ,Diddy etc..pretty much whom ever he trolls after some of your favorite rappers
Is 50 watching 😂😂😂😂
She was just talking shit about him not to Long ago ... when 50 said he like Exotic woman she went on her show talking bout he can’t handle black woman n blah blah now this tight face but job talking bout he’s so nice wtf make it make since girl he don’t want u
That surgery
I love when a lady is thirsty..  like yes love me bitch damn😤
What happened to her face!!!!
She talks like her face is numb
I'm not feeling her plastic surgery on her face at all
If that THING is the love of her life then she got serious issues.  Every chance he gets he talks about her like a DOG.  Dam shame.
Please Fox leave that damn surgery alone. Damn you fucking your face up...
What's going on with her face ? Smthn.......
Just shows u how much ppl dont know what love is, talking bout some "hes the love of my life" but u not wit him lmao
Can she feel her face?
The love of her life is someone who dog you and diss you publicly, Infront the entire world. But the guy u married isn’t the love of ur life wow. It goes to show that most woman want what they can’t have and love someone who doesn’t love them back.
Vf no more surgeries please you already beauriful. But leave that boy curtis alone he moved on.
”When I met Vivica...I thought I was on to something....but then then the next week...ah, man it was nothing”😂😂😂 I got no pick up lines, I stay on the grind, I tell the hoes all the time, bitch get in my car 😂😂😂
That's deep 🥂
😵😵😵her insecurities ruin her beautiful look her and lil Kim
She miss the candy shop
She didn't keep it classy bc she told the world that he liked 2 have his booty hole played with! He then went on the attack against her & she then learned to shut her fake mouth, bc he was dogging her out, & she wasn't ready 4 the kind of smoke that 50 brings!!
Vivica Fox is probably the sexiest black woman in hollywood, if looks were all in a woman she would be the one to marry.
Click bait she said he was not he is
Do you think about me 🎵😂😂
And still do love him did she wanna shed a tear!! nearly
Damn 50 . He did say he got the major stick. No homo plus a pause. I ain’t never have a women down bad like this.
It’s sad beautiful women are so insecure of themselves smh 🤦‍♂️
Vivica trying to get a role and one of them power spin-offs 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Notice how she said he was crossing over into the CLUB.... secret society
Her face is making me mad.
Ya should have seen her before the surgery.... 🙌🏽 that's the verison 50 was shooting his shot at
"Good girls never give it up, but anything is possible, if 50 fk vivica " ,I didn't say it ,if u know the lyrics kudos to u. 😉
Least she’s honest
She called this man the love of her life and was never even married to him. This chick sounds like a GROUPIE.
Never tell the public who you dating rich or poor they coming to destroy
Wow she use to be Beautiful 🙌🏾 damn shame : / age gracefully 🙌🏾
Wtf she was stunning,  and now she looks like a complete plastic dummy!
People making fun of this on Instagram because she seems hooked on him still (allegedly!) But this is her being vulnerable, a WOMAN and allowing herself to heal from someone pulling the rug from under her feet unexpectedly...See when someone does you wrong, cheat or leave you..REMEMBER! the other party is still in the same place mentally "in love" that's why communication is key TELL THE OTHER PERSON YOUR FEELINGS HAS CHANGED! he did it like a jack in a box  🎉surprise it's over🎉 he detached so easy, quickly, and abruptly because he didn't want to be held accountable or face her feelings (this is how people trap you and keep you from moving forward even if you are great yourself like VFox you can't let people come in without knowing their intentions and harvest your energy like that) ...granted sure it's his life and choice, but how you deal with someone ESPECIALLY their heart that loves you says alot about you as a person...
She just looks like she aged to me  but what do i know.
Those cheeks are packed so tight with fillers, that her cheeks won't even move! LMAO!! I still love ya, Viv! ❤️
Gotta respect her for keeping it classy and not trashy. She speaks with respect and dignity...
If he was Curtis the mailman,  we would've never heard about him being the love of her life , maybe that's unfair but just a hunch.
50 Must have really really had her sprung because she still talking about him 18 years later
Vivica fox used to be such a nice looking girl , until she fucked up her face with botax
Hollywood don’t want the real
Vivica didn’t need that surgery
Good for her i'm glad she squash the beef with 50.
Used to be in love with her in the late 90s early 2000s was so fire and natural!!! Now all the surgery + age catching up ughhhhhhh 🤦🏾‍♂
Hold up I thought it was the 03 BET Awards 🤔
Just remember. She's isn't hot to trot for any McDonald's worker. Funny that it happens to be a multi millionaire. Weird how that works.   Hypergamy at its finest.
Vivica what a classy lady. Much respect 🌹
I hate to say this but I can't get this out of my head. Dj Vlad should ask her why she did that to her face ??
She was so hot in that movie Booty Call.
Just flowers
Mane she look way better I hate when all these beautiful celebrities get plastic surgery like for what
Dam that's fuck'd up!
She called 50 a f-boy recently smh,she's still bitter,don't let this interview fool you.
Do you think about me...
I'm hoping she gets her Bennifer 2.0 moment with fiddy
This female is gonna masculine..
That excessive surgery tho 🤮
Hollywood Viv!! A serve honey!
Oh.. Casablanca's smell good!
this woman was so beautiful.....why did she do this to her self
One fine black woman minus the plastic surgery..
Her face NOW is what Fame does to a person
Long story short...  he got what he wanted out of you! Just say that sis!
I really would like to hear Kevin Samuels take on this
Have y'all in the comments thought maybe her husband has a love of his life also? And it's probably not Vivica lol this is life, everybody has a past and it just is what it is. Married couples don't normally marry for love anyway honestly
I strive for her skin tone when I tan
She looks so different..
Chile this clip has 50s gf bothered 😂
She might need to get therapy and some hobbies. I would never give a man the satisfaction of knowing that I was still thinking about him decades later.
Whoa! What happened to her?? Why
She gives her reasons why it ended. None of them would have mattered, he would have dumped her anyway. Too much Smashing ti do.
I just came here to say she gorgie :)
I remember when she was known for Kill Bill. Sad
Damn 50 still have mind control over her after this interview 50 ego just went up frfr
Boy yall on 1 in dese comments 🤣🤣🤣
Prime example ladies... Y'all are hot for a min.. But we as men are like wine.. 50 was up and coming, she prolly thought he would fizzle.. Now look who still loves who
Still talking bout that dude.  Let it go
She should had stayed the same she has always been fine especially when I seen the movie two can play that game she just always been fine period.
Omg wat happen to her face
SHE was too good and too much of a real woman for 50. Bless her! Loved 50’ debut album, though— props to Dre and Eminem!!
It was the 2003 BET AWARDS WHEN ALL.THIS HAPPENED
Whatever she doing to her face she need to stop ✋
She looks like a female version of Charlemagne tha God😂😂😂
You simps better watch and learn 🤣🤣🤣🤣
She wants him back!!
Wow! She will forever love Curtis 😂I wonder how her Man feels every time she talks about him
Ima keep it a 💯 i think she thought at the time her image was too good for a “rapper” now that 50 has found success as multimillion dollar business man AND has success as a film maker 👀👀 she wish it ended differently but i could be wrong 🤷🏾‍♂️
I like when black women speak like this they just have a voice tone that demands respect when they talk. Similar to Angela Basset
It seems like they were in 2 different relationships, he says she crazy and she say he was the love of her life 🤷🏾‍♀️
The true definition of an Alpha widow
Keep your business private..lesson learned
PERHAPS. Destiny will bring them back together.
I hope she got paid
I seriously hope 50 one day does something big for her and have Cuban looking dumb AF!!!
Yeah that plastic surgery and Botox looking like what little Kim look like back in the day before she turned in to a damn ghoul
She is not cute to me at all she looks wierd
Vivica’s only in love with the fact that 50 is a savvy business man and managed to stay successful and relevant to this current day. She’s just realizing at 56 that he will most likely be the richest man she had and will ever get and that alone is the source for her admiration for him, nothing more. She’s a Leo and he’s a Cancer, so I know that their personalities don’t mesh well from a social stand point, so there isn’t much here other than baller regret from a woman almost 30 years past her prime.
That’s crazy it’s trending #50  and it’s about 50 cent lmaoo
I have no clue who either of these people are and what the heck is a 50 cent???? Why are weirdos in my feed all of the time now???
She hit the wall bruh
She talking respectfully about fif stand up solid
She looking good for her age
People played Michael B. Jordan for being a simp but it sounds like he just working off 50 's playbook.
Its funny that rn this is #50 on trending on YouTube lol
@ 00:30 lol he got up in that dress that night that was the inside joke im sure watch her face after he said that
Hey brothers and sisters, I love y'all and it's just been in my heart today to share that Jesus love y'all so much and unconditionally. I don't know how much time we left on this earth before Jesus comes, but I want all of us to be ready when He does. Let's leave these things of this world behind for in scripture it says in Matthew 24:35 that heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear. " Also in 2 corinthians 4:18" So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal." Time is so short. And I always say this" I want all of us to be saved. " Jesus is coming back soon." with tears in my eyes I love you guys. Let's take Jesus and His words seriously in these time were in. I know the road isn't easy because there are so much distractions and temptations in this life. But through prayer and fasting we can overcome them. I don't want to force anything on anybody or even force them to do something they don't. But if you were to see your mother about to get hit by a big truck, you would do everything to try and save her. So I do the same thing for us about the wrath of God that is to come. I don't want anyone I love, know/don't know or even those who hate or dislike me to face such things. Because I know every soul is precious to God and are valuable to Him. Because before we were born He know us, He knitted us in our mother's womb, He called us to be His children . His love for us is so great and so strong, it's beyond human comprehension, that even the angels in heaven don't understand it. So I want to tell you it's time to get ready, time to prepare ourselves for the Second Coming of Christ, for the trails and tribulations and for the rapture. As you can see, so many people have turned away from God. The world has become so immoral, wicked, disgusting and violent. Killing people without any care or heart. And that shows that the love of God is growing cold in the hearts of people. Please be ready for when the Son of Man comes. Time is running out. Let's not leave this world with regrets. Because I tell you this, my biggest regret is not knowing Jesus Christ earlier. I love you Guys and Jesus loves you too, that's why He didn't think twice about dying on the Cross for us, knowing that we may not even love Him back. Please take what was said today in consideration because ready or not Jesus Christ is coming back believe it or not Jesus is coming back.   How to be saved? To be saved, a man must confess that Jesus is Lord while acknowledging in his heart that Christ must have full rule over his life and that he died on the cross for our sins and was resurrected on the third day🙏🏾. Also one must repent and turn away from thier sin. NOW, is the time to turn to JESUS, do it before its too LATE and the DOOR of Grace is Shut.  Prayer of Salvation in Jesus Christ🙏  Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, and I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe You died for my sins and rose from the dead. I turn from my sins and invite You to come into my heart and life. I want to trust and follow You as my Lord and Savior.  Spreading the Gospel on every content🙏❤️🤗
She WAS beautiful. 💉💉
We all know 50 ain't no gentlemen...She still want the D lol
vivica a cent
50 cent is writing a shady paragraph right now as we speak. 😭😭😭😭
Vlad you wrong for that lol, wording is everything, she said he WAS the love of her life. Ppl gonna click regardless of the clickbait.
If I Was Best Friend Would U Want Around All Time?
As far as celebs go, she seems super lovely except that she doesn’t wanna outgrow that dated ass “all that ‘n a bag of chips” line 😂
vivica really loves the saying "all that and a bag of chips"
Why would he even ask her about this 💀 😂😂
It was a 4 MONTH SITUATION-SHIP. Let it go!!!!
Sad. Fif really don't give a fuck
I thought it was the BET awards he said that at.
Wow her cheeks don’t move 🤣
I love her...but I'm mad at her for allowing the come up at the time to ruin her legacy as one of the best black actresses ever...she gave away her power to him...& after all these years she still hasn't taken her power back...still talking about this after the way he talked about her...sis...he done hypnotized you or sompn....go see a pastor to break free...
Vivica seems like a cool woman and real, Respect to her !
The best moment of her life was being 50 Cents fuck buddy.
If  she wants him I bet she could call him and he will do anything she wants
50 said she ate his ass. If a chick do that she definitely love you.
If a girl admitted that you were the love of Her life even when Dumped her on a radio show and still talk good about you... Brother you just walk away from your soulmate
Seen it click click click
What’s up with the weeve and plastic surgery?????????????????? Dang Vivica!!! Noooooooooooooo! And you mean to tell me that none of her friends are saying anything?????? Not even her image consultant????🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️ Call KEVIN SAMUELS ☎️
Vivica seems like a cool woman and real, Respect to her !
She sounds like Kaitlyn Jenner ! Black women I look up to stop botching urselfs
50 cent is the love of her life ? 😂😂 wtf
Charlemagne the Gud and V. FOX LOOK LIKE TWINS. HOPE NO ONES BONES GET BROKE...HMM!!!
Damn she botched asl
Came here to laugh... my tongue is 2x as long as that punk 50 cent...lol.. Vivica don't even have a clue how good my tongue is all night.... outta here coz dunno listen to this bs... she's stupid and apparently easy to satisfy... he ain't huge...ain't bout shidd..lol
I respect her honesty. Everyone tries to be so unbothered these days and it takes a lot of courage to be real and vulnerable and stand in your truth.
The wall is UNDEFEATED.
At least she is consistent. She was crying over him when she was on Mo'nique's talk show many years ago.
🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️ All of this for a man is NOT thinking about you.
lmao this is at number 46 on trending
She looks like she can’t sleep
Think 50 feels the same . He’s just tough  about it . Bet he’ll confirm this when he’s older . 50 still young minded and loves to play with the youngsters via comedy & trolling .He will tell us, later down the line
The comments keep mentioning her look. I personally love the enhanced look on her,  it’s fresh and up to date . She looks stunning . She looks younger and vibrant . You can tell she’s confident in her legacy and that’s why she’s sexy classic royalty.
Her face looks like she took more shots than fifty damn how many shots can a woman take
Tbh w you I hate she doesn’t see her worth enough to let it go. Girl 50 didn’t deserve you. Your VIVICA FOX !!!!
That thung sex hit different 😂😂 50 put that  anacondo on her she ain't been the same since him 😩
Umm 50 hit her up
50 cent even said in a interview that he doesn’t like how she keeps bringing him up and that if it was the other way around ppl would be coming for him saying he’s crazy .  Something alone them lines
Just haven’t met a real man like me
She played herself getting involved with 50 Cent , he was trolling her.
At the end of the day muscles and cash are all women want.
*Hey, to you reading* .. you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
She broke up with 50 cent to be with her one, true love....   Cool Cat
I woulda been like ( who cleaning this $hit )😂all them flowers
So in other words 50 can still smash..my guy👊💪💯💯
😂😂😂
She now looking like WENDY 😒🤢
She want 50 back she ate his butt
Vivica: The reason why we broke up is because we went public too fast and everyone was in our business.(But it's actually because I cheated on him.)
You didn’t need all that plastic love.
As a woman,  I am embarrassed for her!!! Stop this ish ViV!!!!! ☹️
"When I was was with Vivica, I thought I was on to something, then the next week.... Nahhh man it was nothing... hahaaaa" - 50 Cent
That plastic surgery ain't no joke, geesh...How is 50 the love of her life, & she was once married?!? These women be all screwed up in the head...haha
Damn she is full of plastic 😂
50 missing out.  That’s a woman that would die for him.
Those are her feelings and she owns them! 🕊
When Ms Fox talk about 50 I think of the song 50 cent magic stick
Vivica Fox's husband is watching this while pouring liquor
I wish they would stop asking her about him. He is disrespectful whenever he talks about her. She is too dignified to revisit that bag of trash. She loved him and he didn’t even trip leaving.
She did look good in that dress
Didn't they meet on the set of Independence Day? She played his mom, right?
Why is this still a topic? Seriously ...
Ppl sayin 50 living rent free in Vivicas head but Glad the one askin dees questions she just answering
Kinda pathetic
DAMN BABY, whatchoo do to yo face?!?! I guess its true, money DOES make people turn ugly!!
Vivica is such a pretty bird. She fell in love over a compliment. 🤔
He used her for being more famous..vivica hasn't let go of him still to this day
Why is she still talm bout dude?!?!!!! 🤦🏽‍♀
When she tried to make her shocked face her facial expression didn't change one bit. Look ladies love yourself leave the needle alone. Still got love for ya Viv but 🤦🏿
She's beautiful! I hate that she got all that surgery on her face 
i know Dj Glad be laughin his ass off when he reads the comments... yall are HILARIOUS
I just came here to say it was the Bet awards not the soul train awards lol, when 50 talked about Viv's dress
D must of been good cuz 17 year later she still bonkers 😂
When the bad boy uses them up, the good guy gets the leftovers.
Love you Vivica.🤤😍🤤
50 definitely gonna hit that again
Imagine being the husband and hearing those words. ⏰⏰⏰
Why did they put all of that makeup on her, it looks like they use the makeup that they use on deceased bodies, because I never ever knew it was a different makeup, until I took my family members make up saying this is what she wears, and all of that, they was like there's a different makeup for the deceased, and I'm like oh s***, I don't even know if it's Revlon or what, but they definitely use the wrong kind of makeup, I don't think it's so much as classy surgery, they use way too dark of a makeup on that girl especially to be there wearing white, it's a good thing she got that wig super super long, cuz if she even turn her head the wrong way that outfit is done
Idk why CL is being shady Vivica has a right to express the love that stays on her mind for her ex. I'd love for Viv to get a second chance with fif because she's been adamant about her love for him for many years.
she still fie , but bruh 😢
She still glows when talking about him.
Damn she real
To her it was a love story! To him it was a drive by! Its was cute for a min!
How can you be mad at her for saying positive things about her ex? Smh people are weird 😒 but if she was bashing him that would be ok? Smh Tell yo truth Vivica!!!
Who would have thought 50 cent has qualities to make  a woman fall in love with him. She is madly in love with him. Dont  see how. He is a drama queen.
A fake woman is anything real
John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9. That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen!
Yup they still smashing
Hmmmmm.....
Shes shooting her shot
Vivica WAS natural beauty. The surgery was unnecessary.
Her face no
was*
She sounds desperate for fame. That shit was mad long ago and she still stuck on it.
That's a man in a drag. Wake up yall.
I would t dare love as more than he love me. And that’s just that on that
Vivica starting to look like Wendy Williams smh
For 50 to do that to one of the top black beautiful female celebrities, dude is a real gangsta! 😂
I know 50 cent just watched this clip , started laughing 😂 and scrolled down to read the comments .……
She still want that P
Talk about kill bill
Omg what did that man do to her to make her still hve these feelings for him? Lol like I would hate to be obsessed with a man years later.
Why is Vivica still stuck on Curtis all of these years? She thinks it's because others got into their business... I think, Vivica got into the relationship too quick with a younger man who had a crush on her but she fell in love and he didn't
I bet Fif has a whole different reason on why they broke up
shes got so much bottox her face doesnt move
Too many fillers and too much Botox. So unnecessary.
Yea 50 tear P**sy up she the crazy type. Run 🏃🏿‍♂️
Damn Vivica fell for the okey doke. 50 gassed her up, he hit then they broke up in 4 months. It's like 20 years later and she's still stuck there.😔
She looked better before but its her body
Vald says explain and ohhh do they!
Aww she still loves him it’s so obvious.  You can tell the happiest moments of her life was when she was with him.
Her I mean his age and transvestite is showing
Jeez her lack of facial expressions is disturbing.
She need to be in more movies where tf she went?
Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16"  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17):
I wonder what his current lady thinks of this?👀
Damn 50 was nice
Next I want to find out how she met Cool Cat
Ya lil crazy
Viv sis its over ...stop making a fool of yourself. He clowned you all over the streets ,and yet here you are. Smh 🤡
That Botox😐😐😐
Vlad don't want none of mamas cookin especially being friend with charlemagne haha Interview kwame brown!!!
Lol wow can’t get over it.
If vivica fox  ...lil kim, and the list goes on and on ..etc etc ...would have just grown gracefully naturally into their age..  they would have maintained their value with time...she looks crazy and I know she thinks her doctor is the best....total recall, judge dred smh!!!!!!
Ok so how did you guy meet  Vlad on the gossip girl!!!!
Old bag of chips
Good thing he ain’t with her now he’ll be looking At plastic all day
Why her face different though lmao 😂😂😂😂
She said 50 Simpin and trickin....I don't believe it! 50 Cent gangster!
Wtf with all the plastic surgery? She was beautiful prior to the surgeries
Well, I was already Vivica Fox!  Ok you better say that Vivica! LOL LOL
Though they broke up because she was marketing herself with his name and brand and that annoyed him. At least that is what he said in an interview.
1 Corinthians 14:33 For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.
Damn wat the fuck did she do to her face, not to diss.. Women, God blessed u wit every capability you'll ever need to be the best of you that you can be.. Fuck the superficial shit.. Appreciate your inner beauty and compliment the natural aspects that God already blessed you wit.. And always remember, do it for yourself, no1 else.. Stay natural, stay beautiful, God bless 🙏🙏🙏
So Viv ate up multiple samples of 50's DNA  for flowers ? Guess A fair exchange Can be considered a robbery! ...
help me
Hahaaaaaa Curtissssssssss got a milf still in love with him . Lol
I never  heard  her say he was the love of life  b4 POWER blew up.. ijs.. I've  heard  her diss him plenty of times tho 😏
Imagine doin all that for a chick (the flowers) and then not messin wit her no more after like a year smh .. I’m not goin
She's obsessed with that man, she need to move on
Id still 👏 them cheeks . She didnt aint have to do that to her face tho
Ill check 50 ig in 30 min
Finally what we have been waiting for 😃
Those were the BET Awards
What girl wouldn't love to have her home filled with beautiful flowers.
He's a cancer and she's a leo. I totally understand the attraction. They are excellent lovers. Never disappoint.
Did Curtis leave vivica for Chelsea handler??!! 😲😲😲
Didn't he say in public that she ate his ass? 😆😆😆
At this point, I just don't understand why she keeps taking about dude. Just decline.
She want that bagg😭😭😭
Wow I didn't know she like that about him.
A lot of yall laying it on thick. Vivica was cute at best average.
I’m scared of her face 🤮
Much rezpeckt to Viv for her smile n comments Abt that dude after wat all he said
Take a shot for everytime she says everything and a bag of chips 😂
This my friends is DELUSION.
Good on her for admitting it. Love is a beautiful thing even if it didn't work out. Just be glad for the experience. Takes a big person to do what she did. Unfortunately 50 being immature even as he pushes 50, he will mock her instead of considering her feelings and being kind.
Viv look good
In my Gillie the kid smile😆
Vivica's seems so down to earth and her sense of humor is spot on, :)
She knows not to saying anything side ways about 50
Damn why she get all that surgery
Fuck all these surgeries.
All after divorcing her husband because she was richer than him.
She was already pretty why touch yo face man
Vlad nosey asf! 😂😂😂😂
This person got a mask on this is not Viv
She Still Look The Same From Booty Call To Me Shidd😂💯
God I hate click bait.. she said... HE WAS THE LOVE OF MY LIFE!!! Not is the love of my life!
Vivi has had a hell of a life from biggie mentioning her on his last album to dating 50 cent
She miss The D and the luxury Move on Miss fox
If 50 was a regular degular it would been a different reason
She still wants a rich nigga back
50 could hit it 1 more time if his relationship doesn't work out.
When I was with vivica thought I was on to something. Then the next week man it was nothing lol
She shouldn't have licked that boo boo...it might've scared 50 She Still loyal though..
"These hoes crazy mane" Pimpin Curly voice
Charlamangne tha god with a wig
She was such a dope looking woman but all of those fillers, botox and lip pumps make her look bad smh
50 man lool shes still hot
Down bad
Whats wrong with her face
Beautiful because of the makeup? Too much for me plus the same weave wearing. Would love females to be more natural but at least a combination. The women today look the same and are predictable.
At the end of the day, Vivica had her own money so it wasn’t about the money. It was about being a gentlemen.. That alpha really.
Her face don't look natural.  She low key not ass fine anymore
“He bought me a lot of shit” so he’s a gentlemen.
She getting old 😱
Smh wow 😳 this is too much surgery ma'am. She was already Fine smh
Love of your life? Sounds like you're stuck. Move on.
hey voice kills me
She's a real one for that real black woman for you.
She sounds like a hollywierd robot I see why he ran from her goofy ass😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
50 fucked her head up
50 cents put that thang thang on Vivica,  and see ain't been right since.  Lol
It was the BET awards.
SMH lol 😂 she won’t let 50 go 😅
Coolest sister
Don't believe her Fofty she just wants a job on one of your shows
Aye!!!
He’s a cancer that’s how we treat women we really like and have a respect for and we like our relationship private...I know all the women I had a moment with still think on the kid 🥰
She out here looking like lil kim😩
Nobody at all:      Vlad: let’s interview Vivica fox Nd talk about 50 cent .,,
20 years later she still talking bout fif 🤦🏽‍♂️😂
Watch the next video Vlad be like “50 made some bold claims that you ...that you umm ...that you had licked his under carriage “😭😭😭
Didn't she call 50 a eff boy....recently
I remember that king magazine she was in whoa 🔥🔥🔥
Nobody is going to mention the "Do You Think About Me?"music video?
Am I the only one thinking about Independence day.,...lol u know the scene..lol
50 touched them insides like no other that's why she still love him 🤣🤣
Aunt Viv trying to get a role on Power RESPECTFULLY 😂😂
Ruined her face
Idk i`m not such a fool but i believe her what she saying. sounds kinda cool too
Like most of them. Stuck on the guy who MOVED ON. The Guy they didn’t cherish until he left, now your stuck alone and belong to the streets. So cliche
ITS OVAAA VIVICA STOP ALREADY!!!! & you jus Embarrassed the shit out of ya Husband...DAFAQ YOU DOIN???
She sounds like Alexis fawx
This bih a clone! This aint the Vivica that I fell in love with from Juwanna Man!
"anything is possible if 50 f***ed vivica"
bruh 50 must have knocked her walls loose, she cant get over dude lol.
She's 11 years older than 50 cent lol.
Why she always shaking her head like something wrong with her!! Face don’t match the voice..
Her attitude, mindset, tastes and preferences is the Personification of the Black Woman for the last fifty years. I find it disgusting. If women are attracted to no good men then all of their complaints should fall on deaf ears.
What did she do to her face?
That was the "2003 BET Awards!"
She letting 50 know she want another shot but keep it on the low.. Oan, she jacked her face up all that surgery!!
I waited for 50 part. Not gonna lie
Her face look weird 🤔
Never clicked a interview so fast
Hit the wall, old and done..lol the commenter below me talking about surgery 😂😂😂 naw she damn near 60..and look at the pandering likes..can't make this shit up
Wrong nigga to go to for this interview big sis 💯
You can hear it in her voice she really did love 50, I'm sorry Curtis and that is special.... ♥️
damn she got her cheeks and lips done, her face look fake
All that and a bag of chips, she says that more than crunchy said Glad.
Take notes young Kings. Tell that bitch to get in the car and she will love you forever.
She looks happy asf and at peace
What has she done to her face? What a shame!
"Love of my life" was she being serious?  It was obvious that they were both in it for the clout and exposure so what tf is she talking about....
Her natural beauty was insane.Hope she finds a guy who will marry her and love her forever.
This is the video form of d**k-ma-tized! She calling him the love of her life. Meanwhile 50 was calling her crazy and saying how she was stalking him at the gate of his estate🤣🤣🤣🤣
Vivica A Who?
WHY TOUCH THAT BEAUTIFUL FACE 😢🕵🏿
There’s really a magic stick  🪄
It was the BET AWARDS...not SOUL TRAIN!!! She had me 2nd guessing myself.
SHE DID IT FOR YALLL!
He shot his SHOT on national tv! Nothing was gon EVER be private after that 😂
That one eyebrow bothering me. 😫😫😬
I thought SoljaBoy hooked them up?
Man she looks like Wendy Williams now🤢
Just why😭😭😭 she can’t even talk right she doesn’t look or even sound the same 😔
Played herself.
We r still talking about this?!?!
She will never be happy.
Crazy thing is..Meagan Good said the same shit..he was the love of her life🔥🔥🔥 50 was living
Do you think about me....
Just have alot of money and the best women will love you and see you as kind, generous and a gentleman. Lol
50 D’d her down good lol.
He was the love of my life, but you werent the love of his life.....big difference!
She literally can’t smile with the back of her neck flipping up...🤣
All these rappers be lying in music and these boys think they are real lol.
It was the BET Awards actually.
She’s so sweet for saying those things about 5th I always said to my self self I hope 50 finds a good woman who loves him more then his mom did  , yo
She looking Wendy Williams now. Seriously
Vivica ate fif's groceries 😂🤣😂 Tied dat boy down and clapped his cheeks 😂🤣😂
Y did she do that to her face
So you telling me 50 is to Vivica what Lil Wayne is to Karrine Stefans? 🤔😱
LOL 'he was the love of my life'     her man better have a serious talk when she fly back in....
She smiled big after his name was said. Magic stick.
A mature woman can express her feelings truthfully. And, its o.k to say if you know.  Who was the Love of your Life. A lot of you young people. Really don't understand true Love.
bag must runnin low
She keeps it real about what she felt and how she feels now...I love that. Ahwwwww so sweet.
She still loves him.
Vivica....So what do I call u?.....50....Curtis💯👌🏿Real Guy man💯He could have said call me 50 💯 He said call me Curtis 🤣🤣💯💯💯
Salute V on this on💯 I believe that all day💯I know they still alright with each other💯Out of all the Shhhh we heard 5 say about any and everyone and everything we never ever Andre 3000 never ever never ever heard 5  say nothing bad bout Vivica💯
I think, Vivica Fox really loved 50 Cent..However, I don't think 50 Cents really loved Vivica Fox. He seems like he is very childish and immature. He still has a lot of growing up to do..He wasn't the one..
50 done knock dat back lose🍆💪😎💀
That surgery really f'd her face up. Don't know why some women feel they need plastic surgery.  Just love yourself
She's still fine as f***
What video was she in
Had her wide open eating groceries lol and still open the reason why the relationship ended is because 50 was done with you
Damn he put the smack down on her.
50 can still get it !
50 need to send her some better extentions
"I was already Vivica Fox"!!!!! I love VV she is the G.O.A.T
50 Cent puttin it down!!!!
Still looking good to me!  GOD!
Translation: she still wants the D!
I might have to disagree with vivica at that time 50 was a Playboy I don't know why women think they can take these dudes from off the streets to make them into husbands and boyfriends
50 was the love of Vivica's life ..WOW.
Vladimir stop mic n ppl incorrectly U can hear their heartbeat
I don't know why women think when a guy spends money and buys them roses and all this dumb stuff that it means something only an idiot does that using money to manipulate and women fall for it all the time. I'm not female but the way I was raised when somebody offers you something it's best to say no when you accept any gift or present you're indebted to that person I'm not saying all the time but just be mindful when I'm offered something I say no thanks
This is just proof that the guy she “settles for” is never the guy she really wants.
Damn her face is just plastic now.
It was the BET Awards (2003)
Det Boi Fofty Still Can Hit🥴
Celebrities are overgrown children outta touch with reality. I'd love to see how they'd all act dirt poor or living on a normal person's budget in America let alone another country.
SHE USED TO BE SO FUCKIN BADD.... SMH
I can look at her and tell she nuts.
Girl you need to get over 50 cent clown ass, yea he showered you with gifts, but time to move on.. he has
Her "reason" she gave for the breakup was hilarious 😂.......😒.
Vivica was always bad especially in bootycall
Is she saying he went hollywood lmaooo
Nothing what she said their made sense it was her modern woman attitude that killed the relationship, that's why she still hoping for him to walk back through that door because she knows very well it was her fault. That why in his song he said " when I was with Vivica I thought I was on to something, then I realized nah it was nothing", smoke &  mirrors she was......
Hell nawww..this a V. 🦊 Stunt double....y'all ain't fooling me.
She sound like she related to professor Sherman Klump 😂
That's good to hear!  But like they say it  End how it starts
The topic we were waiting for you to get to Glad. 😂😂👌👌
“He WAS the love of my life” you gotta chill with these titles bro.. get the shit right.. IS & WAS are two COMPLETELY different things 😂😂
Don't look the same to me
She still on this????
This interview was brought to you by the face formerly known as Vivica Fox. Wtf??? 👺
If he's still the love of her life why did she insinuate that he might be gay?
I remember that night it was at the BET awards 2003 I was hyped for that brother for getting with her !
That was the BET Awards right?
after all the accomplishments she still wanna be side chick...have self respect damn.
Her face expression in the intro 🤣
Plastic surgery wasn't necessary, she had the natural beauty
I agree I would've just left that private they is a chance they can get back together
When I was with vivica I thought I was on to something but by the next week its nothing  -50cent   50 is cold hearted
Vivica look AND sound CRAZZZYYYY wtf! Black women STOP gettin botox
50 cent beta asf
Went out Vivica, I thought I was onto something   But then the next week, nah, man, it was nothing
I came here thinkin she was about to drag 50 turns out she’s the only one that has somethin nice to say about him
I love vivca always will but I think she needs to not even talk about curtis cause he doesn't mention her at all it look like he may have turned her out
Just imagine if she would’ve aged naturally 🤪❤️❤️
He didn't ask if she was a gang member
50 said she liked eating the tootsie choco shoot lol
does she really have a phatty? can anyone confirm ?
What is wrong with her face 🤷🏿‍♂️
🤯
Yo salute to her for not playing the victim and for admitting what he meant to her. Women take notes!
How did the press killed their relationship. They  got into the relationship for publicity & clout
Love of her life? Her ex husband must be like….
She's the only one that has anything positive to say about fitty. Everyone else hates his ass.
that was deep I felt that
good video
She wanted that big
She loox nuts
Do her eyebrows move???
I think when I saw her in the mid-late 90s/2000s, she was at her prettiest. This breaks my heart , she looks artificial. Natural beauty  gets worn down by societal standards apparently . I've always loved Vivica's look and presence.
I can relate
She looks different 🤔
He can get them guts now.
“ you ain’t gotta lie Craig”😂😂😂
Its her thinking the downfall was publicity for me. It wasn’t though!
I loss  respect once she started hating on ice cube recently for simply wanting to negotiate with both Biden and Trump on behalf of black interest. Now look Biden hasnt done a thang for blacks smh
Me a Vivica. The same birthday 7-30 ♌🦁🤞🏾💪🏾💯✨👌🏾😁
She look fake asl
You know 50 gonna respond to this lol
People saying she dont look the same she looks good for almost 60 years old.
I love her. She’s so classy.
Finaly
Sounds like she still wants him respect
I get it...thats real😘
This is only 3mins?
🍿 is ready and so am I! 😂🤡
Bet awards?
Her face ain't even moving ? Am I trippin ? She didnt need all that plastic surgery on her face
Curt Migurt
People are exaggerating, she doesn't look that bad... I've seen much much worse.
"I was already Vivica Fox" That's when you lost me. Ego...
50 cents has alot of money. She loves the dough lol
Shawty look like jigsaw
I remember 50 had put her on blast , saying she ate his ass 🤣🤣🤣👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾.
It sound like she’s shooting her shot again 🤔
What have you done to your face vivica
He spent bout 20 racks on them 💐 🌹 🌸. Boiiiiiiii that must've been some 🔥 cat 🐈 🤣and 50 was LOVE OF YOUR LIFE?
Going public to soon will always ruin a relationship
"We went public way too fast."  Correct me if I'm wrong, but 50 claimed she was using their relationship to get exposure.
Love u Fox 🦊💕
Thanks for the video, VLADTV
It was the BET AWARDS WHEN SHE WORE THAT DRESS
He said that shit & she mentally threw her panties at him. 🤣
Why Vivica, Why Vivica...🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️. damn, damn, Damn, DAMN....
50 did some things to the sac she still in love
Botox
Sometimes I feel like some womans gonna start to fly with those lips.
Yikes! Did a bee sting her face???
In my 50 voice.. If I can hit once I can hit twice
How you laugh and don’t shit move except you lips😂😂😂
“Nah, man it was nuffin” -50 Cent
50 need to knock it down for old time sake 😭
when i was with vivica i thought i was on to something but the next week nah man it was nothing
I Hate How she talk its annoying 😂😂😂🤣🤦🏾‍♂️😭😭🤷🏾‍♂️
Beautiful interview and it's always good to hear from.. vivica.
Wow, I mind my business so much, I didn’t even know they went out
Not sure she means it hope she does. Either way she is smart to say it, compelling story. Highly doubt he will ever go back there. He knows the formula and what he is. Stay with that barely known young dime.
She looks great lost weight
Still like her. thats a black queen .still have it ..50 ah  fish .fully GAZA free worldboss alien 👽 brain 🧠 God of music 🎶
All that shit pumped in her face 🤦🏾🤦🏾🤦🏾🤦🏾
Okay
Ya cant stop whats natural sweety y u do that to your face
So she likes scumbags, go figure
Tha fuck did she to to her face??
what did she do to her face.. im really angry right now.. she still bad though..
Sounds like she got older, was stubborn in her ways, ran him off and now realizes that he was the best and last good producing man she ever had...🤷🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
I was waiting for this!
Vivica Fox is “all that and a bag of chips!” 😅😂 like if you agree
The surgery was so unnecessary.
She looks crazy af
I love her honesty!! Too many people in our business and went public way too fast.... Respect
Only dated 6 mos..50 said she took advantage of his fame for her gain..Vivica did nothing wrong..yea right
50 cent ran from that freak
I love Vivica. I think she is one of the most realest and transparent people in the industry. But friend, its the tossing of the fake hair for me. Stop it. She keep shaking her head like she's tossing her hair back. Stoppppp it! With love🥰
Curtis: i cant wait to get intimate with you   50 cent: i got the magic stick i know if I can hit once I can hit twice....
🤳🏾50 Gone Kill Ha On The Gram*Smh🤳🏾
50 said it best, "she like my smile, she like my style, she love the way I talk......she from the country, think she like me cause I'm from New York.
5️⃣0️⃣ like whom shall I prefer 🤔 Vivica or Olivia ... Hummmm? 🤔🤔🤭🤣 Lol
She looks like lil Kim,  beautiful...
Sound like 50 put that ghost on ol Viv..
Wtf she looked fucced up compared too what she use too look like sad 😢
Take notes women she can teach u alot ...
I am impressed with Vivica.She is smart, honest,talented, and BEAUTIFUL !! And what really sets her apart from the rest of Hollywood is she is down to earth.I feel like I am talking to an old friend
Yes,yes,right,yes,yes
Vivica= 50 is the love of my Life, 50 = I fell in find out she look like Wendy William, my Lord I ran away fast furious as I could before the plastic wheels fell off hahaha. Finally look at it now, I was surely right hihihih plastic surgery hell of a demonic drugs lol
God made you the way he wanted you, when "TRY" you re-create you then I'm like Keith Sweat..."SOMETHING JUST AIN'T RIGHT"!!💯
Damn y can I c Wendy Williams when I look at her
Leos be the main one wreaking havoc in a relationship, then want to come back and talk about "ALL THE GOOD TIMES WE HAD" Vivica is speaking straight from the Leo Handbook. - signed an Aries scorned 🙃
She is an alpha widow. Shout out to Rollo Tomassi. I feel sorry for the man who dates her in the future. 50 cent will always be in her head (rent free) even when the new guy is blowing her back out.
Time just goes too fast
She look like the puppet from saw.. damn man, why these beautiful women keep doing this shit.. she got that always surprised look.. 🤦‍♂️
Nah fiddy look at her age a was like she's just to old for the long run
Thats not why....you started getting those lip injections....Nigga bounced....
Eeeek
Wtf a summer relationship that didn't even last a year = love of your life. Someone make it make sense 😂
Pathetic
So, Vivica is basically saying “Let’s do it again but don’t let nobody know cause I know you got a girl but I still love you!” 🤷🏾‍♂️
He must of really put it on her. You can hear it in her voice
I am so sick of every video being talked about her plastic surgery. Like damn we get it but it’s not like everyone in Hollywood isn’t doing it. She wouldn’t look like she did in Independence Day of her older movies anyway because she is aging. Your body changes and that is okay, get TF over it!!!
Botox Botox Botox....yuck! 🤢🤮
"When I was with Vivica I thought i was on to something.... Then the next week... Nah man it was nothing"   50 Cent been toxic
Be honest. This is what we were waiting for lol
She talked shit about 50 Cent for a longtime, now she copping pleas and calling him a Gentleman and Love-of-her-life. lolol Wow
I love her transparency and honesty. She is very mature woman. And I’m not just talking about her age.
Damn I guess 50 ain't all that bad as ppl protray him to be. But he is still petty asf that's just facts
Get Rich Or Die Tryin
50 Cent more like $.15
She was beautiful, but with all that stupid surgery has killed her looks.  Ladies please stop that crap
What she do to her face 🤦🏿‍♂️
Daamn!! 50 can have that anytime he wants, got her on the backburner
“Went out Vivica, I thought I was onto somethin' But then the next week, nah, man it was nothin'”
Fuck outta here "He was the love of my life"Vicky was just some Ass to fitty
Have u ever thought of something and the same day or the next it pops up in it feed
Sounds like he ran some Class A game on you lol.
Sounds like 50 can still beat it up
Man she should’ve never got surgery still beautiful doe
Damn what did she do to her face
Ew
It was the bet awards not the soul train awards .. that was the year he won 2 awards he opened the show and he had beef with lil Kim decided not to perform magic stick with her
50 a lover boy 😂
You can see all that surgery
His money is the love of my life Lol
She is married but 50 is the love of her life.. dammn😂😭
They need to get back together, they’re both older and more mature
Exactly why relationships never work cause people wanna get involved that has no business being apart of
“And anything is possible...If 50 fucked Vivica”
Oh noooooooooooo Ms. Vivica 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️
Too many people in your business will do it every time.
And the question we’ve all been waiting for 🤣
Omg I could tell she loved him, because when Vlad mentioned his name her face lit up. And to hear her say he was the love of her life. 😢💔 wish they would’ve made it. But unfortunately they were literally from 2 different worlds.
She playing it safe! She knows 50 is RELENTLESS when it comes to his troll game and she wants no part of that!! 😂
THAT WAS THE B.E.T. Awards
she still want 50 bc she ain't got no money !!!!! lol
😭😭😭😭😭
What did he do to make this woman fall so deeply in love? I need some game 50
How many parts are to this Vlad 40??? And when is he gonna drop the whole video next year? LMFAO
Damn fif what u to this lady ? 😂😂
He needs to ask her about her and 50 beefing and him saying she tied him up and ate his ass 😆🤣
....didn’t she say he was gay??
For the people who don’t know by now yes we get it she’s had surgery so I’ve been what seems like one of these videos everybody’s got to make a comment about her in surgery who the hell cares at this point.
Bet awards you mean!!!!
This my guys is a women who has be wipped she loves that man
50 Cent a funboy let Vivica eat his ahh 😂
You  got to love  her in  this  interview, So   Real. FOX IS STILL   FOXXY
Surgery did her so dirty, I bet her feelings must be muddy! 😂🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
😂😂😂
Vlad always clickbaiting. She said he was not is the love of her life.
She's always looked crazy to me. Still does!!!
Lmfao, nah 50 had a million bitches. He didn’t wanna be tied down. That’s what broke the shit lmao. He brainwashed that bitch lol
It was the BET Awards.
When I with Vivica , I thought I was on something..but the next week man..it was nothing hahahaha🤣🤣🤣 BITCH GET IN MY 🚘!!
ewww im sorry but she didnt need plastic surgary she look bad like not in a good way...... she must got 2 many white friends
Wait a minute she spoke so highly of him so why is he always saying she talks about him in a bad light?
So he got her by hitting her infront of people and then spends money on her that early, its all famous amd money, he dont have no game like that, i make females be with this papi by giving them kisses and ice cream
I still can't believe that she eats azz bro! That's a young persons game, she's 57!
I always wondered if she was who nas and az was talking about on the essence.
50 was busting that out like pimples on a college freshman's forehead with no Clearasil
Dope....1~Luv
Why she f"*** up her face like that 🤣😆🤦🏾‍♂️
Damn what did he do to her ? Why is he still even a factor for her...🤦🏽‍♀️😩 He don't even talk about her do he? 👀😜
50 simp not cent
50 watching this w a smirk doing his signature laugh
She look weird
This was deep...
Vivica was so much prettier without the surgery. I still can’t see her without thinking about her eating the groceries 🤦🏾‍♂️
Damn 50 turned her out.
Because he’s one of us! He’s one of the girls, chyyyy💅🏽
Sounds like she still wont 50😍😍😍
I feel Vivica there are some people in our lives that we are just forever in love with 😍🤩
Dammm vivica i rap too!
I will still hit
50 a clown Curtis a busta
Was da bet awards
All that surgery , you ugly now 🤣🤣🤣
She looking like her old self again
You say that now bout 50 but you didn’t say that a few years back which led 50 to expose your ass.
......and she STILL loves this rotten dude???? WOW.
He was the love of your life. Wow wow
I gotta ask 50 how vivica shake that ass 😂😂 webbie a fool for that line
She needs to stop before she starts looking like Latoya and Michael Jackson.
She look better
Just sad.🤷🏾‍♂️
I’ve been ‘patiently waiting’ for this
‘And then my face went ...(tries to drop jaw)...’... Nothing. Not a fuckin’ move..... Jesus.
It was the bet awards
Ayo 50 , she still loves you dog!!!
That’s seasoned kitty got moist when 50 said that then all down hill from there lol
Wow! She spoke from the heart! No slick subliminals!
Cuban Link watching this like 👀😶🔪😂😂
Vivica was already pretty,  she didn't need those surgeries.
Went out wit Vivica I thought I was onto somethin, but then the next week nah, man it was nothin!
She handled that explanation very classy and positively honest. I so respect her for that response.
Her face looks real Muppety 😬 Howdy Doody like even...
Salute to vivica not being a thirsty clout chaser who bashes ex men. Not many women are like her.
Fif was jus tryna get some 🐈 and she talkin he was the love of my life🤦🏿‍♂️
THIS sista is DELUSION!!! She was a clout chasing cougar! GET OVER YOURSELF.....NEXT!!!!
A chick that isn't hating on a guy she's isn't with anymore.. wow.. they do exist.  Respect to her
I Was Hoping That Video Woulda Been In The Recommended But Naw. Wasn’t There. See It Next Year After A Lion Giving A Dog A High Five
Yea she loved tf outta him. She used to do his GROCERIES!
Man she has had alot of surgery done to her lips and face ....she use to be absolutely beautiful she still is ...but I wish she just let herself age naturally
50 CENT - " I don't know what you heard about me but a bitch CAN'T get a dollar out of me, NO Cadillac, NO perms, you can't see? that Ima MF, P.I.M.P ⚔️🖤🔫....  "    VIVICA FOX - " I know him as CURTIS and he is such a gentleman and filled my WHOLE HOUSE up with MY favorite FLOWERS🌷🌹🌷🌹...."  ME - NEVER meet your heroes, they aren't who you THINK they are... But I did hear that 50 cent really is a G in the streets though...so heyyyyy IDK.... LOL
I don’t think the face filler looks that bad to me
@vladtv vlad it was the 03 bet awards
Why she look like a surprised cat nowadays,  fucking with her face, bad move.
It’s always that one ☝️ that we hold a special place for in our hearts ♥️! Vivica is classic!
She looks ridiculous 🙄
It was the Bet Awards
50 cent must got that anaconda damn vivica 😋
And she also tells how she ate his booty and he told the world. To be honest it takes a real woman to go that far for a man. Salute to Vivica Fox.
is she the love of 50 life?
They made history
In other words, the game went to his head but She ain’t been the same ever since 50!
IF IM UR HUSBAND AND U SAY ANOTHER DUDE IS THE LOVE OF UR LIFE IM CHEATING AND SMACKING DA ISH OUTTA U
Least shes being real
This all we was waiting 4 basically
Look at the state of her face,WTF!
She brought 50 some rims... p.i.m.p
All that and a bag of Botox
She love him bc he has money
Naw she became a stalker I don’t understand why women can’t keep it real. He even said he had to get a restraining order on her
didnt she cus 50 out and make up some outlandish shit and now shes like hes such a gentleman .. then she says hes the love of her life they only knew each other for a couple months lmao .. 50 did the right thing
He wanted that P bad.. all it cost was some flowers? Lol jk
She's starting to look like Wendy Williams....NNOOOOOOOOO
Trying to hold onto to youth for dear life
That’s that cancer ♋️ Love. You can’t get any better than that
This woman a lil crazy
why she didn't say she  is way too old for him
Wtf happened to her face? She was so beautiful
He’s the love of your life and every time he talks about you he acts like you were a obsessed jump off.  her ex boyfriend is the love of her life. It says a couple of things. 1 , why would you say sumthn like that publicly when you are a celebrity.the back lash alone is going to be ridiculous. So many people are going to comment on it.she is going to be a meme soon . And she is basically confirming if 50 wanted to hit again he could.why give a person that much power
Now i really want a bag of chips for some reason...
Messed herself up with surgery. She never needed it at all
Awww ❤❤
SHE CANT EVEN CLOSE HER EYES THE SURGERY IS SO HEAVY😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
50 said she is not classy enough!
Its a shame she got all that work done.
She kept it real 💯💯
Damn glad I would of never thought she would of been up here
Her new facial structure is bothering THEEE FUUUUCK out of me.Ladies love yourselves!Surgery is not needed!
Surgery oh my ooh my
Tairq Nasheed said she couldn't control a boss. Everytime she says his name she breaks down in tears lmaooooo!!
VLAD SPITTING THAT FIRE🔥🔥🔥 TODAY!!! PREACH YOU BIG GLOWING RUSSIAN ELVIS👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
SHE STILL FEELING THAT MEATSTICK 🤣🤣🤣
Looks hidious
Tee Tee Viv, I love you and have been a fan of yours for over 20 decades but please stop talking about this man. And put it in your contact that interviewers are prohibited from asking you about him going forward. I'm begging. Please!
I fuckz with her but she straight lying...now why she sitting here making a one night stand a relationship 🤦‍♂️
Filled her house with flowers then he filled  her up that's the American way 😂😂
Dam she f up her beautiful features come on what is going on with women these days why they can't be happy with what god gave them and be bless.
I thought that was the BET awards 🤦🏾‍♂️
she is so cooked up... yes
I call BS he cheated on her just kidding

Oh I see what she doing she trying to break up a happy home go on Vivica get yo man back🤣🤣🤣🤣
50 beating his meat off this clout

Imagine what it was like when it was time for her to get all those dead flowers out of her house.
Slow down Vlad get rich or die trying ain't fucking with kush groove or Purple Rain!
It was actually the 03 bet awards
I can't even watch this. 🤭
Wish she wouldn't have done that plastic surgery to her face she was the dopest Damn it ☹️
It was actually on the 2003 BET Awards. Cause I got it on tape.
Hollywood relationships are a circus. I guess she felt like she was getting flushed and decided to do it for more momentum.
This gentlemen is what the wall does to women. When the looks and glamour is gone, all they have left is what if’s and the love of my life. If only they realized sooner.
So 50 who never married you nor proposed to you or gave you a kid is the love of your life but yet the man you married you clown him like a dusty ninja cuz you didn’t want to pay the bills all by yourself...... boy women are a trip......🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
50 gone have a ball with this one he probably say something like I knew she still want me 🤦🏽‍♂️😂
He must have  knocked the bottom out that joint 🤣💯
I can just imagine fif watching this rn with that huge grin 😂😂😂
Seems like she’s picky. She broke up wit her other man because she was paying all the bills and now she’s saying they broke up because they went public way too fast. Wtf 😂
Didn't she stalk 50?
In short 50 can still hit
Who gives a shit
Yes his generous he keep fooling with a idot like young buck who keep dissing him
It’s official when your people gets in touch with her people to get in touch with you
Kevin Samuels watching this interview somewhere smirking
Who has to get rid of all those flowers!? Jeez... what a hassle
Her face has it's own will, please ladies, leave it natural
Gotta respect her honesty
Lol nah you ran da nigga off by being a psycho it's ok jus keep it 100
50 put that thang on her sheesh lol
He’s a love ma not the love, love of self should be first and far most
Vlad who da hell is this heffer..,,. This is not Vivica wtf she done to her beautiful face 😱😱🤣🤣
Perhaps... "Dickmatized" the movie???
They broke up cuz he realized she was pushing 40 at the time and he could get a bitch just like her but half her age
She looks horrible
Hey viv  here's a  breath mint
Me too,she didn't need it,n its showing, you can see it
What is that thing she keeps doing with her head?
50cent gave her the good magic stick till this day she love him😂
She went crazyyyy on the surgery
Love of my life. Wow
50 must was blowing her back out 😂
Lets go 50!!!
she must have same surgeon as Wendy Williams she starting to morf into her ruined her self SMDH
FINALLY lol
Yeah Vivica you disrespected his son mother & you stuck on yourself
I promise you Father Time is undefeated. Life is so short fam, Yal be safe and enjoy your time.
She's a fav but I always  feel like she's doing her best Tina Turner 😂 "My name! All I want is my name!" she is a bit exaggerated.
Her face doesn't  move smh...still cute tho lol
she can't leave 50 alone....lol
Who else waiting for 50 to go live and respond?!🍵🐸
Ladies y'all are beautiful and natural stay away from them surgeries 😩
She means his bread was the love of her life
👺Why she got da tight face 🙈
I new this part was coming 🤦🏽‍♂️Probably the reason for the interview 💡
That was Bet music awards
he smashed it
Oh my God...she is STILL talking about this man a entire decade later?? Where is Iyanla!?
"When I was with Vivica, I thought I was onto something. But then the next week? Nah, man it was nothin"
Kinda sad they didnt work out..It started publicly with his nice complement on her dress at that award show..
You can’t see that ima mfkn p.i.m.p
awe- I love that Vivica is so honest...She is a legend.
She ugly now
This lady gone forever say "all that and a bag of chips"😭😭
So Shallow 🥘
50 the goat
He was a Kid honey.... That's why it ended
Bruh why she did that to herself she was perfect already 😠
She's killing this interview. Very good job.
She doesn't really believe in her beauty like we do, I hate that she fell for the trap of money and fame
Don't let professor Dr. Kevin Samuel's see this🤣🤣
stop doing face fillers girl. Your skin isn't supposed to shine on your forhead
She married the wrong 69
I hate plastic surgery 🤦🏾‍♂️
I saw a video where 50 said “ aw man I let her lick my ass now she thinks that I’m gay” 😂🤣💀🤦🏽‍♂️
He said some crazy things about her. I wouldn't be all mushy speaking on him.
Gotta dominate the pumz fellaz
She fucked her self up frfr she was one of the baddest In The industry
Verk kind and generous but when you are upset he gay...
The guy that has, on his own account, regularly slept with 9 women at a time is the love of her life. The real love of her life is probably 6 right now in 2021.
She looks like something created by the puppet master!
Why she talking like a snobby white woman
I knew it... I knew she still loved him 💗
She's delusional.....
50 put that thang on her
Shes so beautiful
She played herself with this man. I wish she would stop talking about him. He hit and quit and she fell in love.
Curtis be tricking on these women and stay getting used. When Curtis met Vivica half the industry dusted her ass off. Trick ass Curtis Jackson
But anything is possible , if 50 F@$& Vivica-The Game
You can say whatever but she solid for keeping it a buck
Vivica hasn’t been the same since 😅
She was so easy 😂😂😂😂
Vivica Fox: So what do I call you?  50 Cent: Curtis  Cam’ron: CURTISSS!!!
I don't believe her. She had said some foul shit about 50 calling him gay. She just trying to holla at 50 because if his influence in the industry and the dude is mega rich. Yeah right Vivica. She clearly has hit the wall and she wants him back.
Nah, that boy pound that brown round
50 cent still blowin that back out on god
That plastic surgery looks horrible on her. Yuck👎🏾👎🏾
50 gave her the magic stick
50 cent :   Crack bought the benz /  rap bought  the rimz/ Vivica  bought the Gemz/ I told  yall   I am Fucking Pimp /       Rap City the basement  Freestyle
50 get this taking down soon
“ when I was w Vivica? I thought I was up to something.  But then next week? Nah.. it was nothing.” 50
Damn what happened to my Vivica Fox
Soundin like another worn out industry chick. Sounds like superhead. " I knew him as Curtis". He knew you as side chick number 5.
She’s not all that anymore with the plastic surgery but she does have some csl lol 😂
50 is a Playa Playa 😎
She 1 of the goats fr but martian family  on yt
50 probably don't even remember hitting her
Viv sound like that aunt who would beat you if your mom ain't around
Okay......I see you! Man that had to be 💕!
Treat them mean keeps them keen.
The video we've all been waiting for . "When I was with Vivica, man I thought i was onto something. But then the next week, nah, man it was nothing hahahaha" - 50 Cent
Translation- 50 had money my ex didnt...thats why" I luh he"
It takes a very very strong, confident woman to admit when a man still has her heart. Even after they've broken up. I salute Vivica for being honest and not spitting BS about Fif. That "magic stick" is one powerful tool. If only mine was  that strong😭🤣😂
She still admits her love for 50, wow!
I must admit she's a good actor
Nothing like having a gorgeous thug, intelligent, nice body to go home to.   End of the day a wake up call, answer the phone.   And you did answer the phone at the right time.   Dam you guys looked good together, look good is not always good.  YOU are all of that and a bag of chips.   WERK.
Dam these still coming out
She fucked up her face real bad. She looked so good back in the 90s and 2000s.
WoW, VLADTv 😳!! LoVe Queen FoX but GET IN2 "dA' SCANDAL 😂!!" Get in2 dA' figHT betwEEN her & 50 🤭!!?!!"
50 cent know what he doing he keep him a bad one look at the one he got know
I absolutely LOVE Vivica Fox.💓💓💓💕💕💕💞💞💙💙💜💜💜💛💛🧡
OMG EWW! That's not love, that's a karmic entanglement.
Part 15 just to watch this interview
Fake hair, plastic surgeries, obviously insecure and clingy.... who knows why their relationship ended???
This is the same woman who went public with that she ate his ass and then try to say the his manhood should be questioned. The cap is real.
Wow this is a beautiful resentment, Vivica talk with class and love when it comes to 50 cent
50 get back with her lol
She said “ HE WAS” vlad change dat damn caption wit yo cap ass
Im NEVER calling somebody the love of my life that broke up with me.
She didn't age well
Curtis: “And I wanna thank Vivica fox for wearing that dress”  50 Cent : “Bitch get in my car”
Truth be Told 50 made u look Dumb! After this interview Vivica u just made urself LOOK DUMB! sorry 2 say u should of stood Quite about the situation just saying.
She took that makeup off  and that wig 50 cent  woke up that day 🤦🏿‍♂️
His generosity was just game and him flaunting his money, and of course she fell for it 🤦🏾‍♂️. And it's funny how whenever a girl calls a guy a gentleman, it's requires the lavish spendings out of his pockets
Hey .50! 😂     I know you in here. 😏
He smashed and moved on I get it
The Oscar goes too 😉
So, let me get something straight. 50 Cent was the love of your life. Not your husband.. Yeah, that makes sense.🤔
Welp no need for a part 16...this is all I wanted to know about 😂
No you went public too fast!!
The wall is undefeated lol
She really loved dis nigga 50 sheesh you can tell she hurt. He the one that got away 😂😂🤟🏾🔋🚀
I always liked 50 with Vivica. They just always seemed good together. Could’ve been like will and jada but without all the weirdo shit.
Shoulda know that p.i.m.p song issa out
She didn't need no damn plastic on face!!! she was PERFECT!!!
Fif was killing her shit.. QUEENS STAND UP!
50 gonna have a field day wit this lol
Aww shit let me get my snacks for this portion.
50 a Real One for treating a Real Woman how she is supposed to be treated 💯
She didn't have to get work done. She was fine the way she was
Why does she keep say "all that and a bag of chips" when that went out in the 90s? She may as well say "Right on, jive turkey!" or "Dy-no-mite!"
Finally lol I admit I was waiting on this a few weeks now hehe respects.....MAKAVELLI THA DON!!!!....50..YER GOOD...BUT YOUR NOT 2PAC....Did Viv ever meet Pac?? Dont know if she been asked
That song wit snoop dog is out the window curtis 😭😭😭
Jesus she blinks a lot
Vivica “Yesssh” Fox
50 was in love!😂😂😂. He be playing the rough neck game in public but in private boy be crying about how much he love Ms Fox.
Love of her life? Love of her life? Wow
anything is possible if 50 vivica
Now the man that's dating vivica right after 50 or now,how d0 you feel hearing she's saying this about 50??...These are the type of women you stay away from that still has love for their ex and talking about love of their life..
She didn't need all them fillers man. She was always fine as hell
He's the only dude who did all that 4 her that's sad .......
She only loved him because 50 is a boss and has money!
All I can think about is that 50cent song “Get in my car” when I was with vivica I thought I was onto something but....🤦‍♂️
I mean 50 is a 1 album wonder bum...
She seems so chill,all the best to Vivica. 💪🏾
*Married another dude, but 50’s the love of her life. A lesson to you simps out there. Being a sucker doesn’t win in the end.* 🤣🤣
It's all about the money
She still obsessed with 50 cent I see lmAo
I knew it was coming 😭. I like viv but that relationship was almost 20 years ago. He’s always mean when it comes to her if I was her I wouldn’t even acknowledge him.
People in your relationship business don't stop a real thing 50 had too many women she said it on 106&park plus diss his sex game being salty.
She loves HER BAG OF CHIPS PHRASE 😂
What about Rick Fox didn’t you keep the Knigge’s name
I'll say this.. I have a completely different view of Vivica.. I like how she conducting herself.  She seem cool as hell..
Remember vivica i thought i was up to something and than the next week it was nothing
I'm genuinely surprised 50 wasn't seeking a a reimbursement on all them casablancas and gardenias.
She said “HE WAS THE LOVE OF MY LIFE” he goes vlad with the click bait. The title made it seem like she’s still in love with him.
Yet 50 cent was a ting like she was craY obsessed with him .yet he never mentuon the part of him buying her attention/love smh . Most guys don't be spending shit ton of money on anything  lol what ever just to get a girl interested. Shows he got no personality and game to get her him self with out money .smh he couldn't even go to her and get the number .he got someone else to get it .lame . He ant no Playa.
She knows she was a bust down, She on Hollywood shit
Vivica A Fox: Curtis is the love of my life *Cuban Link has entered the Chat*
Not Vlad bringing up the dress after she already mentioned it 😂🤦🏾‍♂️
I'm just always amazed how women date known lotharios and think this is the guy that I will build a life with and put all my love into.🤔
They should do a movie together might spark a new FLAME!!!
We have Arrived
She should've never married 69 if her heart was with 50!! Broke 69's heart!!
Everybody gets a turn  ...
She ain't been right since..
Hi edagdwg thanks You tube for sharing this story of what happens when you love this man and enjoy each other's company pay attention to what you want for your life Linda j. God bless you and fifty God bless you both linda j.☮️☮️☮️☮️☮️🙏🙏🙏🙏🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
That's cool but she still didn't have to imply the brotha was gay after that magazine cover he did with Soulja Boy
I love when black women aren't scorned... It shows respect and maturity. Definitely a grown woman ❤
Vivica Fox, Cuban Link...my boy 50 really has a magic stick 😀
I think she would take him back if was down. I bet she was crazy back then too.
Ayo 50 i know you scrolling down the comments..What up foo
Anybody reminiscing about the past
WoW! 🙌🏽 she wasn't talking like that about him on 106 & park she was dissing his sex game & all foh she got older hitting the wall tryna be humble now heard about the face surgery her face wasn't like that on Empire.
Cuban will be on the comments 😂
Drag her she went against ice cube and the premium plan. For some reason bw don’t wanna relinquish the power they have in our community. Bm  we have to take back our communities back from bw. It’s a mess.
50 be sending all these chicks he like flowers it’s a tax write off, business man hustle
Vivica sounds like she’s auditioning for another chance with Curtis. Damn guh, it’s over
😯 she really was in love with 50. That’s a trip.
Shout out kill bill  I referenced vivica in my song  “Don’t envy me”
He's the love of her life.. but he doesn't feel the same about her🤷‍♂️
This made me think about and go back watch 50s  video "think about me" in which Vivica was in.
“Anything is possible if 50 fuck Vivica”. That will never get old
She still loves him to this day . Everyone has that person. If u don't understand u don't kno anything about relationships. U can fukk a million girls ...but that one is that one
Maybe I just understand (shrug shoulders) How can the love of your life be someone who's a mean , vile and disrespectful bully to others. Its sound like to me Vivica has unresolved relationship and/or childhood trauma she hasn't healed from.
Wait 50 is a gentleman?👀‼️💯🤔
So much respect for a woman that can admitt how she truly felt about an X that maturity is hard to come by.
We all know you just wanted some vitamin D, stop playing young lady lol
He put it on here
Vivica dont want no smoke
She messed her face up with plastic surgery. Should have aged gracefully!
50 be dog'n vivica till this day and she still be professing her love for ole boy. Shit crazy how the mind work lmao
I’ll never forget 50 said she was eating his ass 😂😂😂Thas love 😭
She really wanted vlad to pull the video up when she 1st got noticed by 50 😆
She licked 50’s behind literally. Sad
her face is so tight from botox i am surprised she can blink her eyes. HOWEVER, that said, she is still a DIME. FACTS
"Financial" love of her life.
do do do do do u think about me
But she tossed his 😬
I’m bad bitch independent woman that I don’t need no man.  NOW OVER 50yrs OLD AND DYING ALONG
What TF happened to her face 👀 smh niggas gotta stop tryna emulate the WHITE MAN & WOMAN
Vlad getting desperate for content.........F dis no integrity having leech
50 Cent is a simp.
She looks very funny but I still love
My girl's a gangsta, I'm gonna flood her house with all the dead weeds from my back garden.😁
What killed it was when the novelty of banging a “movie star” wore off, he realized she was old.
50 did her wrong with the ass licking comments.
Her natural beauty is no longer.😞😞😞 She is not as pretty.
Sounds like vivica still got feelings fo mr curtis
She was dating Curtis, not 50 Cent.. but 50 ego was growing big af during that time
Show of hands if you know for a fact that 50 is gonna troll da fuck outta Vivica for this 😂😂😂😂
What was the last thing she did ........50 on a roll every since what lol she wants to be by his side again
4 months in almost 20 years ago and he’s the love of her life and he’s says she was obsessed and a psycho she sprung fs😂😂😂😂
Is that charlamane the god under that wig ?
50 simp
Chelsea Handler said the same thing. Curtis is a Demon
Haha she's nuts.
Her face look hella stiff 🤣🤣🤣 🤡💉💉💊
Damn woman he dumped your ass like 20 years ago get over it already.
She miss that $$$$$$
I hate plastic surgery, so unnatural!!!
Vivica is a good woman.
50Cent: "When I was with Vivica I thought I was on to something, But then in the next week naaaah...man it was nothing"
Ahhhaaaw...that was super sweet and honest
People in ur business killed the relationship or did u kill it? Sounds like she was sayin alot of nothin
Anyone wealthy ritch  Amazone and around it   I love em 2  Love of my lives lifes
Vlad she clearly said “he WAS the love of my life” stop the click bait
What i really respect & admire about Ms. Fox in regards to this topic when asked,is that she always maintains that he's the love of her life. I don't think people understand how big of a deal that is for a person of her stature to even share something like that publicly.
that plastic surgery tho
So she likes him cause hes generous lol typical
Besides the Whitney Houston discussion, this is the most intriguing clip of Vivica's interview.
I love this woman, but she get a white mama 😂😂😂😂
50 saw how crazy this lady was....then he 🏃🏃🏃
Not for nothing she's like another Lisa ray been washed up and done with.
It was the BET AWARDS😊😊😊
A love Vivica, she was one of my childhood crushes! I just wish that is beautiful woman would've aged naturally rather than getting the work done.
Maaan she look fresh out the casket😳
He forgot about her ass quick fast
Is IT Me or Did she just confirm That 50 is A Real P.i.m.P🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
She shouldn’t have spoke to something like 50cent she should have picked a man a better man.
“When i was wit vivica i was like on to something” Who knows the next line 🤣🤣
I remember her talking bad about 50..Now he's the love her life. Delusional breezy...
The guy she married and had to pay all the bills she could care less but 50 is a boss that a different type of luv Pay Attention!
She so Hollywood it's not funny
watching her speak I can't help but think it's something off with this lady that I can't quite put my finger on 🤨 can anybody help me out? lol
Alpha widowed
Dam Vivica looks terrible. Plastic surgery gone wrong 2.0🤢🤢🤢
Yooo Fif a simp 😂
Wow she still have soo much love for him even after....that’s deep but she’s always been a very beautiful woman and during that time she was real big in her acting career💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
So Vivica basically wants 50 Cent back.
I KNEW THIS WAS COMING😂😂

She was so beautiful why change your face?
This is the part a lot of y’all was “patiently waiting” for 🤣🤣
She didnt want to play her posistion.

50 gave Vivica the Magic stick 😂
Shit if I was Fif I’d be hittin that TO THIS DAY!!!2X
50 Cent needs to do a How To Rob Remix and mention Vivica
"Anything is possible if 50 f*cked Vivica"  The Game
The GIF w/ 50 laughing and smashing off replays in my head.🤣🤣🤣
Lol he whipped her good
What wrong with her face, grow old gracefully she looks like a, don't say it, she can't breathe.
Now why would she get plastic surgery? I couldn’t even notice her!
Surgery or not I'm still crackin her
The 50 portion...here we go. This is what we've waited for!
“ I was shocked, I mean I dunno if you could go back and see my reaction but I was like WOW!” Woman your plastic face is stuck in a permanent shocked face🤣🤣🤣
That's her version...50 said he felt like she was using him for publicity
Like Tariq nasheed said, she miss that Boss but can care less about her broke ex husband
What she do to her face jesusssss
If 50 was the love of your life, then that's a poor life XD
50's trash
But Did He Love Her Like A Fat Kid Love Cake Though?? 🤔 LOL
I know 50 cent just watched this clip , started laughing 😂 and scrolled down to read the comments .
vivica really loves the saying "all that and a bag of chips"
50 must have beat them cheeks like he beat up Ja Rule.
How many flowers does it take to get that sweet cookie? 50 cracked the code.
50 somewhere like bruh again 😂
Auntie Vivica the love of my life chileee 🤦🏾‍♀️🤣 she definitely was never the same afterwards from her beauty to her career
The title is going to go viral LOL 😂
50 looking like: Love? Bish we was just fvcking. What’s all this we ish?
Finally 50 questions
That’s sad he’s the love of her life.  I will never respect that mean dog.  He treats his son like shit.
"When I was with Vivica I thought I was into something, Then the next week...nah, man it was nothin' Haha, ha!"
50cent Classic album. Taking over the rap game with that album get rich or die tryin
Why is she talking like she's in a movie playing out a role
Man, what happened to her face?!
Of course 50 the love of your life. He’s worth 30Ms compared to your 4...
50 still got a shot to ask 21 more questions
only reason i’m here
Vlad released this one last
Ima need them to get back together but I love what she said about him being a gentleman a cancer ♋️ will always make you feel loved 🥰
This is what everyone been waiting to see and Vlad knows it 😂
Went out wit Vivica I thought I was on to something, but then the next week, Nah. Man it was nothing…..
50 cent and Vivica were cute together but I'm glad she doesn't owe him money
She still drags 50 name through the mud after 15 plus years so who really moved on.🤔
Finally who else’s was waiting on this to touchdown
She was married to a man who was broke and didn’t love him. She met 50 who wasn’t with her long as is the love of her life
What everyone was waiting for
What we all been waiting for
I see Vlad finally got to the juicy shit
Yes the only thing I was thinking of when I seen she was being interviewed
Waiiiit 50 and vivica had a thing going on???? 😭
Set it off “Classic”
I told vivica that you're worth more than his name...so don't settle down for less 💪😎💯
50 cent has moved on.
She's beautiful! I hate that she got all that surgery on her face 😩💔
