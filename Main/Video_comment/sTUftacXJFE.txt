OMG my Lil Peep Hoody!
We have all sinned. Nobody is perfect or worthy in God’s sight. In fact, the only way our sins could be forgiven, was if we offered sacrifices practically every day. We all sin every day. We look with lust, we lie, we blaspheme, we swear and we steal without giving it a second thought. Imagine all those sin and guilt offerings we would have to offer… but we don’t have to. Because God sent His one and only Son to die for us on the cross as THE sin offering so that whoever BELIEVES in Him will be forgiven and have eternal life. He took all the sins that will ever be on Himself. He paid the price; i.e. He’s the Person who paid the fine for the stack of offences on the Judges(God’s) desk, so He could let you go. That is how great His Love and Mercy for you is. He has no reason to spare you, apart from His abounding Love and Mercy. You just have to accept His forgiveness, repent and turn to Him.  “Ray Comfort youtube”-”The watchman youtube”-”The Lion of Judah youtube”-”Jonathan  Cahn youtube”
man gets waterboarded with a tortilla and ranch dressing
Idk why but it looked like dream face on the thumbnail

You forgot the shotgun
Ranch is the best for sandwiches
That boi doesn’t like ranch
Oh what a supportive son.
My friends, just so you know, the garments which they utilize represent the Knights Templar Order. The red cross is the Order of Malta Cross. Now, do you know why they wear these garments? Because they are Knights Templar. This is an order of the Catholic Church, the church which dominates the world from the shadows, as it always did. Do you think any Youtube channel can have this amount of viewers and subscribers? Youtube is a Masonic website, which is an Ecclesiastic organization. Most governments in the world and successful artists, empresarios, sports figures, politicians and religious leaders belong to Masonry. It is these secret societies, which all revere the Pope. In fact, it is almost unclear where these societies start and where the Catholic Church starts. They blend and complement each other. So, why are you being told this in a Youtube comment? The reason we have (or, as you can see, used to have) the freedoms that we enjoy is due to the valuable Individual Rights which are protected in the National Constitution and which were obtained in History at the price of the Blood of millions of people, including millions of Christians (Protestants). These millions of individuals who just wanted to read the Bible were murdered by the Catholic Church. The Knights Templar were and ARE an important military order of this murderous institution, which still governs from its cursed City in Rome and which HAS NOT CHANGED ONE BIT. It just changed the way of its actions after the French Revolution, now astutely governing side by side with a supposedly secular system. This secular system, however, is conformed by masons which obey the Pope's orders.  These series of videos are indoctrinating its viewers into a diminishment of importance, a fun relaxation of something which will soon not be funny at all. Let us explain this: the free western world which we used to enjoy is collapsing by the actions of a Pope which wants to construct an "ideal" universal village. The manner in which this  is being done at a rapid pace is through the actions of a false pandemic. The falsehood of this pandemic is not the main topic of this comment but let us summarize briefly:   -disease with an average of 99% survival rate -disease which needs to be tested as it presents asymptomatic people. AKA healthy people. -test utilized for diagnosis (PCR) is actually, in the words of its inventor, Kary Mullis, not useful for finding sickness.   The Constitutional rights which protect the individual's freedom of cult, freedom of speech, liberty of conscience are being violated with a scientific (actually pseudo-scientific) excuse. Is the same excuse that was utilized in Hitler's Germany. Of course, Hitler was a puppet of the Catholic Church, obeying and revering the German Cardinals of the time.   The Catholic Church is starting to debilitate the Western Constitutional system with a Pandemic. The Vaccine which is being promoted with the excuse of "herd immunity" (another pseudo scientific theory) is actually, in their own explanation, is an experimental inocculation in humanity. The most important aspect which you are about to learn is the following: THE VACCINE IS A VIOLATION OF GOD'S LAW PRESENT IN THE BOOK OF LEVITICUS. Its process of manufacture is done through aborted fetus. It has unclean animals and blood. In addition, it is an idol imposed at an universal scale for a disease with extremely high survival rates and ethical inconsistencies. Basically declares Jesus Blood as non-healing. It is strange that churches which used to yell: "the blood of the lamb cleanses us" and healed serious diseases, now have fallen in silence to this aberration. It is because the churches are also fallen and infiltrated by Jesuits, Knights Templar, Masons... they have a goal.  So, after violating basic rights of our body (God's TEMPLE) with lockdowns, facemasks, invasive PCR test and now an unclean vaccine, they are setting an inhuman precedent which can mutate into the revival of a horrible monster: a false christian THEOCRACY. The excuse which they will utilize are the same excuse that brough Nazi Germany THEOCRACY: the moral decline, financial crisis, pandemic, "climate change". Ironically many of these problems were also caused by Masons and Catholics. For example: many artists, TV series and movies which promote immorality are MASONIC.  n other words, my friends, these Knights Templar which look so fun Today, want to force the world to follow Catholic religious rites. They want people to eventually (forcefully) go on Sunday and worship the Trinity. By the way, both concepts WHICH ARE NOT BIBLICAL. The 7th Day is Biblical (Saturday) and the Trinity does not exist. What exists is: Jehova, the Father and Jesus, the Son. They are both One in Doctrine BUT THEY ARE SEPARATE "He sits to the right of His Father". The Holy Spirit is God's Spirit and it is Jesus.  So, please wake up, because these guys that dress like this are representing MURDERERS which killed the true Christians and which would want to impose their Theocracy again, at a worldwide scale.  If you take the vaccine, you have the 666, which is spiritual. If you already had it and you DID NOT KNOW about this... well, you may want to humble yourself and pray for forgiveness to the Lord, stating the mistake you made. It is a "sanitary" preparation to violate the moral... or rather HOLY Laws of God. Later on, when religious rites start to being imposed by the Church in a filthy union with the state (the most Christian thing is actually that they would go separate), then those who follow these rites, betraying the Biblical Truth and the Holy Spirit, will also receive the mark of the beast, which is also spiritual. Of course, many people, most people... supposed "Christians", in reality what they want is to go back to a society in which they can continue their sins and their life normally, even secretly. They would be willing to rely on a false theocratic government (even atheists, which by the way atheism was fabricated by the Catholic Church) just to continue their life. However what awaits for those is the 7 plagues and a Lake of Fire.    The solution is to rely only on Jesus Christ, the Son of God. How? Loving Him. How? OBEYING HIS COMMANDMENTS and OBEYING THE FATHER'S COMMANDMENTS, ALL OF THEM. INCLUDING THE 4TH WHICH STATES TO REST AND SANCTIFY THE HOLY DAY, SATURDAY. Please share. Thank you for reading. Blessings.

True men of God don't indulge in anime.
Holy Jesus

this is abnormally growing towards Filthy Frank
I'm gonna slap tha goofy out of you "taco bell sound". Make me laugh everytime
throwing stuff to prepared food is a regular and ordinary swedish way to prepare meal (hint: it's a reference)
It should be “imma slap the taco bell out of you.”
Father didn't account for the fact that his son simply WAS the goofy, and in turn when the father went to rid his son of the goofy, the son was simply erased from our plane of existence. Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.
Waste of food but it was funny at least
The ending implies that all of the son is goofy, which is why the son disappeared.
Taco Bell at the end 😂😂😂
gOOfy
Nobody likes ranch 😳
That was a punch and it sounded like taco Bell imagine a rock it might sound like the church bells
I don't understand what they're talking about without headphones
His father used his fist to wipe out his son from existence not snap his fingers and did it without the stones
Howtobasic v2
I swear to fucking God if Netflix doesn't put these as a show in going to rip out their throats
I bet living with guys is hell
Dong
I agree with The Father that ranch is disgusting and heresy
Gordan Ramsey would never call this an idiot sandwich
Bread boys

This channel has more character development than most Netflix originals

Alguém Br?
Whos the fucking watching it...
Son got sent to the nth dimension, smh my head

Im curious as to what the neighbours think when they hear “FATHER IM SORRY” in a childs voice followed by “IM GONNA SLAP THE GOOFY OUT OF YOU” in a fathers voice
Your vids are so good, that in less than an hour I already subbed.
Taco Bell wants to know your location
Is it just me or is Father's helmet getting rusty?
*"T a k e  t h e  w h o l e  t h i n g"*
Are we not gonna talk about the bell noise though?
What’s with the knights of Templar outfit?
Hey who wants to turn to Christ and live and obey him this life is temporary compared to all eternity Jesus loved you to die for you and this isn’t a religion it’s a relationship. You should read the Bible it’s very important it has all the answers you need. Now you may say but I’m a good person or God loves me and if you believe in God then your good but I bet you didn’t that not forgiven others is enough to send you to hell
It's funny how son said and fuck lettuce 😂😂😂
better character development
uh oh this video has 666k views

I have been missing for a couple of months and now Father only screams 😳
The fact that son forgot to include the blood of heretics makes me question if he is a crusader
Father : NO ANIME  Him having anime on : Father : Vanos snaps*
Oh
The taco bell sound at the end of the video 🤣
Plot twist the sons Impersonator is still there
where did you buy these clothes?
🍞
I honestly thought that son was about to throw the ranch at him.
The best fight of movies
Bruh ive been watching this channel since a long time and it appeared that i was unsubscribed and i actually were very upset XD
I want elders to react to this.
I love how that wasn't even lettuce what he threw
I'm gonna add weed to that
0:43
hey i'm from brazil how did you get this templar helmet
He said ima slap the goofy out of you and then his body disappears
Can you make a new video
I saw your father likes to fight in airsoft to reclaim Jerusalem
Is this a cobblestone farm toturial?
4th ingredient world hunger
The only thing that would have made this video better was Goofys "ya-hoy"
I like ya cut, G
father is it me or have you gained some weight
ask swagger souls to join the crusade
How do you clean the helmets
ingredients: cheese, tortillas, ranch, and ****ing lettuce.
Don't mind me just making a timestamp  0:42

Son, you should've thought outside the bun. 0:43
I was the one who said the n word on the stream muahahhaha
VIDEO IDEA: FATHERS FATHERS GETS CAUGHT WATCHING ANIME
I can imagine you guys getting a lot of noise complains
From the very first video that I saw, I was hooked and by the way keep making videos. Preferably ones that are stupid awesome
Hey! Don't wast food!
Why is he sleeping on the floor anyway? You're just asking to be tortilla'd with religious intent
RIP Goofy
Hello boys, I have a good helmet too.
son is a master chef
howtobasic 2
How to basics be like
Nice
Dad: *SCREAMING INTENSELY* Roku TV in the background: here’s a nice cinema screensaver
Everytime i see sons helmet i think of this line "Tis but a scratch"
Bread Boys. I have been with you since you only had very few videos. Remember me
Deus vult
just an idea, but what if like fathers armor (helmet) was haunted by some annoying ghost that steals only one type of food, and makes friends with son? then father could never enjoy whatever food is taken and he has to deal with the betrayal that his son is no longer holy, instead has a ghostly sidekick? little does father know it's attached to his helmet. f it the ghost could be the one guy with the katana that they thought they killed before lmao
Fathers voice is so calm when he's not screaming
does father actully know how to use a sword
fun fact, everytime he gets shot by his dad he gets respawned
the over night salmd
if teleportatin was invented, would you teleport bread?
That ending tho Lmao
As a Spanish talker it’s funny to hear an American say Tortilla
I think i already know the reference i'm gonna do.
0:08 Instructions unclear: Grocers near me do not carry f**k lettuce
That's a lot of goofy...
0:26 самый страшный хоррор 2021
I like this
These guys helped me get through a stomach ache
The dad's kd ratio must be insane
The son made a sandwich for his father but the father never liked ranch so he decided that enough is enough and punched his son out of reality
This was frighteningly close to becoming a HowToBasic crossover episode
Cooking with bread boys. Best bread boys video ever
suggestion: Bread Boys but its Minecraft Manhunt
thought you should know father son has a shrine to anime and heresy
Man
Two things I found in the Bread Boys But Nothing Goes Wrong 1 Son is left handed and 2 sons gf is Lana rohdes

I am the great grandfather, I must know fathers and sons faces, I'm gonna use my ungodly power and create a video, first bring me my claymore, akm, 12 gauge shotgun, and my beretta
Why does this video give me angry grandpa vibes?
https://youtu.be/Q9R.-yXXXwC8 Wisdom Follow Jesus Christ, he rose from the dead! Obey him before its too late. He is the only way to get to the Father John 14:6 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him; Hebrews 5:9 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Acts 2:38 Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord: Hebrews 12:14 He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy. Proverbs 28:13.
Somehow it's just not funny to me to be throwing food away when there are people starving all over the world and wished they had good food to eat.
Omg another upload? YASSSSSSS
Wow this video is so stupid
Father: I'm gonna slap the goofy out of you Son:           B                                      O                                        N                                  G

For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,  that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, 1 Corinthians 15:3-4   For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 2 Peter 1:16   And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. 1 John 5:20   Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Hebrews 12:2   If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. 1 John 4:15   In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus. Philippians 2:5   I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one. John 10:28-30   Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved. Acts 4:12   But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. Isaiah 53:5   This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 1 John 4:9   My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. John 15:12   If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10:9   But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect. 1 Peter 3:15   Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. Colossians 3:15
Mustard man remake lmao
Father is preparing to fight his father
“It’s his very special favorite snack” bruh XD

Father wants the SPECIAL ranch dressing.
don't dislike there is 666 dislikes
John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Amen!! Repent and turn from sin!! Follow God's sacred 10 Commandments!! Time is running out..

Both of your new uploads got trending
Fun fact:the cross on father's shirt is the haythem's symbol from assasins creed 3
Random story involving ranch one time at our local 99 cent store they were selling ranch but a brand we didn't recognize but tried it anyway and  legit tasted like the that savory ranch you get with pizza but when when we bought it a few months later idk why but the recipe changed and it tasted like any shitty ranch  you find. That was the story of me finding that good affordable dressing we like but can't get it anymore.

This is Total Evil” Sara, a general practitioner, said after watching an interview about forced organ harvesting, “This is really terrible. I knew a little about this before. Such a serious matter does not seem to be widely known in society today, which is worrying.”  Medical researcher Per went to the booth after hearing about it from his colleague. When he learned of the number of transplant hospitals in China, the short wait time for organ transplants, and how Falun Gong practitioners are being used as living organ donors because of their good health, he said, “It’s too terrifying! [The CCP’] actions are disgusting, and this is a systematic operation. This is totally evil.”  State Crime Johnny has long been concerned about China-related topics and the CCP's persecution of different groups. He said, “I have a certain understanding of the CCP and know that there's nothing they won't dare to do. The killing on demand for organ transplant without any concern once again redefines my understanding of the CCP.”  Morten said, “As a doctor, one promises to follow the Declaration of Geneva: respect for life, provide medical care with conscience, and not use medical knowledge to harm life even under threats. This group is used by the CCP to kill people. This is a totally unacceptable crime.”  Katerina is from the Danish branch of an international health care facility. When she talked with DAFOH staff and saw the prices of organs and the short wait time in China's transplant hospitals, she said, “This is totally a state crime.”  Forced Organ Harvesting Ongoing Some of the participating doctors signed a DAFOH-sponsored petition to the UN Human Rights Commission in 2013 and brought their colleagues to learn the progress on the issue.  Anders came to the DAFOH booth and said that it was unbelievable that the forced organ harvesting had not stopped and that the Chinese regime was still talking about increasing the number of transplant hospitals in China. Another doctor, Susan, explained the issue to her colleagues and asked them to sign the petition as well.  Call to Action Charlotte is a medical student and also studies international politics. After learning about the CCP's live organ harvesting, she signed the petition and talked with DAFOH staff to learn more about the situation. She said that this was a very important issue and must be made known.  Peter is a doctor who was invited to visit a Chinese hospital. He expressed deep concern about some of the little-known realities of the Chinese medical industry, especially illegal organ trafficking. After learning about the CCP's state-sanctioned, on-demand killings and that the main victims are Falun Gong practitioners who follow the principles of Truthfulness, Compassion, and Forbearance, Peter carefully read about the investigation and asked for details about some of the cases.  He said, “This is especially important because of the close collaboration with China.” After reading the petition, Peter said, “This is very important. We must take action.”

Wait if your making a sandwich why didn't you guys use bread..? Your the bread boys
For anyone scrolling through the comments going through a really hard time I truly hope things get better for you no matter who you are. Please don't give up trying. There is a reason you are here reading this message, to remind you that YOU are so important to God and His Son Jesus Christ. I can only imagine what you are going through but God knows.  I also know how difficult life can be and I may not understand your exact experience but I am truly sorry that things have been so tough for you. I care and want you to know that you are not alone, you have a purpose, you are worthy of so much. Please take it one day at a time, one step at a time.  I am praying that God will send His angels to each and everyone of you to comfort you, surround you with His love, give you peace beyond measure, and to change things for the better.  Please know that you are here for a reason and that sometimes we don't always know why we go through things, maybe to help someone else going through the same thing because you understand such pain that someone else may not.   Please also know you also have a Savior Jesus Christ who died for you, He loves you more than you could ever know. Please ask Him for forgiveness of wrongs and ask Him into your heart believing with sincerity. ( Please see the book the Holy Bible for more information) He can guide you in all things. I speak from experience it doesn't matter what we have done or that we think we don't measure up He will meet us where we are, even in our lowest low. He can give you peace beyond measure, I speak from experience. I can only imagine how hard it has been for you but I truly hope the best is yet to come for all of you. Please never give up, because He won't give up on us. Please remember this when things are hard and you feel at the end of your rope.  To give your life to Jesus Christ here is a sample prayer: Dear Lord Father in Heaven I admit I am a sinner. I have done many things that don't please you. I have lived my life for myself only. I am sorry and I repent. I ask you to forgive me.  I believe that you died for me to save me. You did what I could not do for myself. I come to you now and ask you to take control of my life; I give it to you. From this day forward, help me to live every day for you in a way that pleases you. I love you Lord, and I thank you that I will spend eternity with you, In Jesus name I pray, amen

this made trending, thats cool
Two vids on trending!!!!!!
I've been doing it wrong my whole life
Its hard to not smile when you know you're watching a skit by the bread boys.
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.
Definitely one of my favorites
The stupidest thing I ever came across, dont know how and or why it's on my feed, Trash!!

This video is better than whole Cyberpunk2077
Best video I have ever seen
Eww gross, now you gotta clean ranch off the helmet.
Can we get Bread Boys to recreate the Lamar roasting Franklin scene.
I wish you would support subtitles on your videos because as much as Google trys it can't understand what your saying under the helmet any better than I can

Nobody:throws shit lettuce at floor
Thank you so much for making me happy. Your guys' shit doesn't make sense, it's dumb by most definitions. Yet I find myself rewatching an hour's worth of your videos every time a new one comes out.
The amount of food intentionally wasted should become a punishable offence.
He forgot the most important ingredient, the souls of heretics.
Why dose this make me feel like there talking to me in real life
C'mon son... Ranch!? Seriously!??
Bread boys but in *how to basic style*

Father: is dead on the floor.  Son: Sanch time!!

👍
Where is that Rause crossover
I wanna see father and/or son plays helltaker
Next time the mother appear ?
I'm so happy... Son's finally standing up for himself and yelling back, ah the character development!
I thought it was going to show a goofy plush flying through the screen after getting the punch in
Yall need a collab with swagger souls no cap
The Heretic Son or The Holy Father.
Father...why is there coom all over ur helmet?
How to Basic: how to make Bread Boys
BreadBoy's + HowToBasic =

Alternate title : "bread boys but it's actually how to basic"
ㅋㅋㅋ
NIce how to basic
Meet the Sandvich
Wow well thats aggressive
Demon slayer fan boy :D
The crusades definitely had an effect on him
feels like its 2008 again
gone, reduced to atoms
No pump action action. That's a no thumbs up from me.
HOLY crap, father doesn't need a gun nor a shotgun, he has he's fists
When did son become HowToBasic?
Nice fetty hoodie
I remember when this channel had 100K. You guys have come so far.
You better do “Son gets roasted by Father”, ya know GTA V meme...
This is the best sandwich the world has ever seen

Slap the goofy out of him. Guh huhck!
He slapped the Taco bell out of him

Ranch is lowkey nasty af

I wonder if their neighbours ever called the cops for  suspicions of domestic abuse?
Guys are you okay?

Bro, my friend made a sandwich so big and unholy, We just named it "the Sanch"
He got goofed.
Slap your father
And that's how I met your mother      don't think about that to much
"And third..." _adds a fourth ingredient_
Father's ability:  Holy Punch "Could punch any heretics into oblivion"
Puts a bunch of shit ontop of father  Puts ranch on father  Father:*IMA SLAP THA GOOFY OUTA YOU*
Imagine robbing the bread boys house and then father comes out with a shotgun
*Looks like fathers real favorite sandwich is a knuckle sandwich*
I wonder if they'll roast Franklin before 2031
so wholesome.
THE TACO BELL IM

What kind of sick bastard puts cheese on a tortilla
Neat.

R.I.P
Damm bro u still make me laguh
Waste of money
I love these guys their like callmekevin but little bit more chaotic
How much goofy did you slap outta him?
I wish there were captions. I cant always hear father too well.
The lore is getting deeper each episode
Unholy sandwich
When the bois upload anything *HOLY MUSIC BEGINS*
he got taco belled
The fact that you did that to a nice medieval helmet murders me internally
Alternate title: Holy sandwich ritual gone wrong!
I was expecting a goofy scream not a taco bell sound but holy sh%t that was funny. XD
Fun fact: if you total up the run time for all bread boys episodes (excluding special thanks videos, Livestreams and lunch meat videos) you get about 1 whole hour of bread boys content.
0:43
I have a feeling son's mother was a weeb, that would explain alot...
Father looked like he was coomed on
Unholy son: Now the Ranch dressing  Father: Now Ram Ranch will give their dressing
i tried this out but i didn't get slapped by my father did i do something wrong?
the holy punch?
One of these days son isn’t going to respawn and I’m always anxiously waiting for it
How to basic in a nutshell
I like the panicked energy
Should've ordered a Chicken Sandwich from GrubHub. 🤦🤣
Gordon Ramsey would approve
*One Hit K.O.*
I’d love to learn what happened to mother
Is father fatter?
Next vid is gonna be in a year
father really needs to get that helmet polished, looking a bit tarnished
Wow the son is gonna become more like father one day if the unholy didnt attack
Bruh just tried to make a sandwich, got sent to God for it
Everybody's gangsta until Jerusalem bells are ringing
And then started Mortal Kombat
My sister was playing the Wii Shop Channel song in the background while he was putting those condiments.
did he change his helmet?
yo father you gotta clean that helmet
Manz got hit to another part of da house😂😂🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀
I'm disappointed son didnt just yeet the bottle into father's face. That would have *made* this video
I wonder what the people in the apartment next to them must be thinking                        I'm sure it's a two-sided thing
Father has unlocked Prank protection mode
120,270th view
We need a LAMAR ROASTS FRANKLIN but instead is FATHER ROASTS SON
son is dummy thick from all that ranch dressing (I'll tap tho)
I like how they added the taco bell sound when son got smacked
My boy is growing up
Imagine being friends with these guys and knowing full well that they’re probably wearing Knight helmets and making videos at any moment 😂
Son uses ranch Father: RAAAAANCH?!?
Why the son is more stronger than the father...... .... .... ... ... ... because the father is old🤣🤣🤣😂😂
Guys Son has abillities from God and watches anime. He has the power of God and anime on his side.     I am sorry for what I have brought upon this cursed land.
0:05 shark puppet : did somebody say cheese ? I LOVE CHEESE !
The most scariest thing son has Ever encountered was a calm talking father
I feel like father is the type of person to go on a crusade in an AMC Pacer.
If the bread boys ever had family harmony it is falling down the stairs
It would be very funny whenever the father beats his son but only for the father’s father to beat him after to show his dominance
Twsted Tea  part 2
0:43 ONE PUNCH!!!!!!!!!!!
Father needs to.upgrade to the super shotgun from doom eternal, the most holy weapon
tortias
I couldn’t do when I heard Taco Bell.

Son got sent to the Shadow Realm

How to acidic...
How to basic will be proud of you
Two videos in one day, now thats something we must celebrate on
This is exactly how they made sandwiches in Jerusalem. Educational!
So this is where how to basic inspiration cane from
Get mayonnaise
I have a question what do you think about Furrys we know how your father thinks about anime but what does he think about Furrys?
Oh shit 2 videos in an hour they on x games mode
Quick post
What happened to the shotgun
Father getting his revenge from being knocked out of existence for making a joke.
Two videos in one day! Also, did they just censor a curse word?! I am deeply offended! I think Susan's catching on to them!
I think son is taller than father
This is the only Holy Christian Channel that I deem educational
how to basic vibes
This is truly good parenting.
What ever the son does for father, father will still take out a shogun and aim it on his face
how often do you clean those helmets?
The son is dead twice......
Noice
You should do SON! what a scp?
Wait, it's only been an hour ! So son has already respawned from getting grenaded ?
B O N G
Ow
I miss the shotgun
So Father just paid pack Son for the ‘Father, your jokes aren’t funny’ video, where son did the exact same thing to father, except it was outside. And it was without warning.
One video a day keeps the depression away
0:42 Obi Wan’s death be like:

Wheres the gun. what happened to the scream?

TheGameingLemur’s like ratio is the most unholy thing in this comment section
Wow 2 in one hour bet u can't do 3 in an hour
that ending is powerful
For some reason I find father's voice very comforting-- I think I have a problem.
The bread boys eat bread for a week challenge
goarsh
I like how son's character progressed and is now almost as aggressive as father.
I think I still have the goofy...     Hyuck...               Not funny, I'll go f*** off then
Better than Gordon Ramsay
For once there's a severe lack of shotguns and heresy... Well, at least the slap made up for it
Ah yes thr taco Bell dong
You know father's serious when he's not yelling
THE GODS! THEY HAVE COME FOR US!
The heroes we don't deserve
My father, I made it here in under a hour, this is truly holy
5 seconds after the ending a taco bell ad played and ended with the SAME BELL!

Son defeats father
*he slapped the goofy out of him*

Father's father father has a father who has a father father who has a father who has a father father father who has a mother who, also has, a father.
Haveing a busy day you two, aren't ya?
Watching that food biting the ground pains me for some reason
what if the lord was mexican?
I don’t know why this is funny to me, but the thought of them cleaning off that helmet while still in character is hilarious in my opinion
It’s Mario Judah
The heresy Ranch
I want father to voice Scorpion from Mortal Kombat
clickbait, goofy wasnt there
"I belongs to poor family" "And I have not job and money" "YouTube not giving me views "I want to handle my family "Ya I am worse than others😔

This gives off the same energy as the Pete’s pizza story from when I was a kid. A dad makes his kid into a “pizza”.
Your acts are great. I appreciate the comedy you guys put out, keep up the good work
Father just slapped the heresy out of son and you’re laughing. You’re just laughing.
I just notice that the son was wearing a demon slayer hoodie
Son is starting to sound more like father
Father kinda sus with that ranch 😳
He got taco bounked
He darn knocked the baby bell cheese out of him
That Taco Bell noise always get me
The neighbor: ah shit here we go again

Damn! Father got so pissed, the framerate shit itself!
DONG
Two in one day?! It must be a gift from God
Bread: what about me...sniff...
Son: *uses Ranch dressing*  Father: Once upon a time, before you were born, I once knew a man during the Crusades. A lovely ole chap, Sir James of the High Rose Garden clan. One night we were eating our rations which consisted of bread, rabbit stew, potatoes, and lettuce. My friend James loved playing little tricks and dousing my salad with ranch dressing. I *ONCE KNEW A MAN!!!!!*  Son: Father, nooooooo.....
the funny thing is this is how i make my burritos - tortilla, cheese, lettuce and ranch

Wait... *I though son died*
Goofy
I want Mickey as a recovering drug addict in the upcoming sequel
gameing.
Wtf is this double upload bullshit? XD
I was hoping son would be doing a Goofy voice or something.
Everyone's talking about the double uploads when we should be talking about the son not putting any meat or chicken whatsoever when he was making the "sandwich"
A rare occasion
Humor

Sandwiches are cool

I feel like this video was  filmed right after son respawned.
Having ranch in a sandwich is quite unholy: it states this in the bible
Impressive, Most Impressive
Two in one day, I like

The best sandwich ever to be made by son
Me:*Watches Their First Upload* Me: Ok Cool Bread Boys:*Uploads Another One* Me: _SON GET THE BIBLE!!_

Two in the same day
The best cooking channel I have seen in my life
I freaking love how son is becoming more aggressive
Awesome content bread boys
Two uploads in a day makes me believe there actually is a God up there.   With a shotgun.
I want them to take a picture of themselves pointing at each other like in the two Spiderman meme picture
The Bread Boys are uploading spontaneously and it hurts my head
ding
Two in an hour   I like
That's my very special favorite snack too.
DONT SAY THAT!
damn, thought i'd be first :(
Vi una tortilla y vine corriendo xd
That was quick
I went frame by frame and discovered the atrocity that is Father punching Son instead of slapping her (Yes that was a really bad joke by referring to Son as a her)
Doesn't knight's armour make them slow?
the father-son dynamic here seems very healthy
I am early
DOUBLE UPLOAD HYPE
Double upload POG
Son is becoming more like Father. Each video he is screaming a little bit louder.
I was suprised to see two uploads today

Really, you did the taco bell but no "I like ya cut g"
i respect the roku tv
4mintune and 1k comment
and we're back again
Is this a Home Alone refrence??
yes
Unholy Son: It was just a sandwich Very holy father: you'll never learn  Satisfactory taco bell punch intensifies
The best waifu is speedwagon
The phrase “it's just a sandwich” is such a weak mindset. You are ok with what happened, putting the wrong ingredient, imperfection of a craft. When you stop getting angry after putting the wrong ingredient, you've lost twice. There's always something to learn, and always room for improvement, never settle.
What are we going to do? Now there are two of them!
Pray your soul to lord dio
Son deserves more praise though. He's been standing up for himself and recognizes his mistakes. It's a shame he got slapped the goofy out of him.
Cam we get a bread boys crossover with another channel please
hy
Gordon ramsay: finally some good fucking food
Covid is getting to their head isnt it.

I feel so honored to be the first comment. All of my hardwork and dedication has paid off. Getting the top comment has been a dream of mine for many years, and i would like to thank those who have helped me along the way. First and foremost i would like to thank god for giving me this opportunity. Next i would like to thank my parents. I want to thank my friends for being beside me as always. I would also like to thank my pet fish for surviving against all odds for over a week. Next i would like to thank the squirrel that lives in my backyard for climbing trees because that gives me inspiration that i need to get through the day. This is a special moment in my life and i would like to thank any of my unmentioned friends and family that have helped me along the way. This moment will be a moment that i will never forget. I just remembered a few other people i would like to thank; Facebook, the bird i caught in standard 3, the light in my room because i wouldn’t be able to see the keyboard without it, the internet for letting me go on facebook, my house because without it i would be homeless.I cannot stress how much of a big deal to me this is. I have been trying to be the first comment on a post for years, but that has not been possible until this amazing day. Hopefully my good luck will continue, but this is undoubtedly a rare occasion. If you asked me how i did this, i would say, you can achieve anything you set your mind on. To all the kids out there reading this, i would like to tell them to follow their dreams. Being the top comment is amazing, thank you everyone.
