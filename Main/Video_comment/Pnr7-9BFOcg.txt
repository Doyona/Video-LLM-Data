1For YHWH so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16 	Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. 	For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. 	Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. Matthew Chap 5  no matter what you've already done the messiah's sacrifice makes you totally clean when you accept the messiah as your lord you gain total access to heaven there is a specific plan for you prepared by God if you have any questions about it do a simple test ask God to show you that He exists and loves you

The reality we can't ignore;  1. When you die the real you( the spirit inside your body) either goes to Heaven or hell. 2. Who goes to hell? those who don't believe at Christ as the savior. e. Who goes to Heaven? Those who believe at Christ as the savior.   Realise that you deserve hell for your sins;  Romans 6:23 plainly states that the wages of sin is DEATH. In Genesis 2:17 God warned Adam and Eve that they would die THE DAY they ate of the forbidden fruit. They disobeyed God, but didn't DIE physically until hundreds of years later. Why? It's because they DIED SPIRITUALLY that awful day, and all mankind has been born spiritually dead since (Romans 5:12). Please understand that spiritual death and the second death are not the same. Every person who is not born again is ALREADY spiritually dead. The second death is Gehenna, i.e., the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:11-15). All those who die in their sins, without being born again( that is believing that Jesus Christ got crucified and shed his blood for their sins, buried and rose again in the third day and alive now in heaven), will be arraigned, prosecuted, and sentenced at The Great White Throne of Judgment and then cast into the Lake of Fire forever.   Believing at Christ does not involve worship of other gods(church leader&ancestors), object(hand bands,car stickers,trees e.t.c) Muhammad,buddha e.t.c. It's only believing at Christ as the perfect sacrifice for your sins. It's your choice but know that rejecting Christ will send you the wrong direction.  Hebrews 10:4, 10 For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins. By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.   Any other form of sacrifice be it animal sacrifices it can't save you but we are only saved through the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ.  No works can save you, there is no physical thing you can do to get saved but you are only saved through faith at what Jesus Christ did for you as simple as that.   Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.  In other words if you want to go to heaven after your death you must confess with your mouth and believe that Jesus Christ was crucified and he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and was buried but risen again on the third day and alive in heaven now.  After believing at Christ as the savior you must change your ways and try to stay away from bad works or sins as hard as possible, you must show that you are a new individual in Christ. e.g stopping fornication, getting drunk, homosexual acts, masturbation, pornography e.t.c.  Romans 6:6 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.  As a human you will still fall at some sins of course as no human is perfect, but you must not swim in sin you must try your best to fight against sins and live a righteous life.  Also grow in the word; I suggest the following YouTube channels; Real bible believers, Robert Breaker and Pastor J.D Farag.
Gutsy win by the lads!  🦾😎  Well done !!! 👍🤗
Although a Chelsea fan, I congratulate the Tottenham fans on their victory. I hope you will take one trophy. With Mourinho should take

I am an Arsenal fan and I hate both Tottenham and Chelsea. But in this match I wanted Tottenham to win (and thankfully they did), because Chelsea and Frank Lampard were getting too cocky after that spending spree. Man bought a whole team this season. Good jobs Spurs on showing those pricks where they belong. I really want Lampard to get sacked. Most arrogant and overrated PL manager. No tactics, no plans just splashing cash.

Did Darude - Sandstorm just play after Spurs scored the goal? 😂
https://youtu.be/GQY8nTz_xdY Ini yang viral
Werner was literally Chelsea's best player on the pitch! The rest were just awful, especially Mount with that failed penalty
who was that spurs player that ran up to Mount to console him rather than celebrating? what a legend..
fuck that lamela goal was so hype with sandstorm
that smile of Mount before Werner scores tho

nternational Community Expresses Concern about the Source of Organs “The European Parliament passed a resolution in 2013 stating that allegations of systematic removal of organs from Falun Gong practitioners and other prisoners of conscience are credible. The Parliament said that the EU would condemn the CCP's actions and warned its citizens not to go to China for organ transplants, because organs may come from prisoners of conscience.  “Doctor Marja Heinonen-Guzejev, who is with an organization of doctor social responsibility, said that Spain, Israel, Italy, Norway, and Taiwan have banned their citizens from organ transplant travel to China.  “Heinonen-Guzejev said that the international research community has begun to pay attention to the ethical aspects of Chinese scientific papers on human organ transplantation. She said that in August this year, the scientific journals Plos One and Transplantation had retracted 15 Chinese scientific papers on the grounds that researchers could not explain the source of organs used in medical research.”

Timo Werner first goal for Chelsea? 5 games 1 goal? As a Liverpool fan I’m happy that we let that 50 mil mistake slide. Jota has played not even a full half for Liverpool and has scored the same amount of goals.

AZ Business Magazine, which is owned by the Arizona-based group AZ Big Media, published an article on April 10, 2019 titled “How forced organ harvesting in China affects the U.S.” The article introduced an upcoming panel discussion on organ harvesting in China that will be held at the University of Arizona College of Medicine – Phoenix.  The expert panelists will include international human rights lawyer David Matas, who has co-authored several investigative reports into organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners in China; Winston Hewitt Jr., MD, co-chair of the Standards in Organ Transplantation Committee of the American Society of Transplant Surgeons; G. Weldon Gilcrease, MD, assistant professor of oncology at the University of Utah School of Medicine and deputy director of Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting; and Torsten Trey, MD, PhD, executive director of Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting.  The panel will be held on Friday, April 19 at 1 pm and will be moderated by David Beyda, MD, chair of the college’s Department of Bioethics and Medical Humanism. Students at the College of Medicine are being encouraged to attend.   Falun Gong practitioners re-enact the Chinese communist regime's harvesting of organs from prisoners of conscience to raise awareness of the killings in China.  Dr. Beyda told AZ Business Magazine that the event is being held to raise awareness of the unethical practices of China's organ transplantation industry and to provide a forum for a discussion on medical ethics. He hopes that the public, local physicians, and medical students will learn about the issue and the ethical concerns of traveling to China for transplant tourism.  Dr. Gilcrease suggested that due to ignorance, the American public and the American medical profession were at risk of being complicit in these crimes. He told AZ Business Magazine that medical schools in the U.S. had been training Chinese surgeons in transplant medicine and that these surgeons had then returned home to participate in these unethical practices.  The author of the AZ Business Magazine article wrote that Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting has appealed to both the United Nations and the U.S. Congress for action to end forced organ harvesting in China.  The author wrote that Congress had passed House Resolution 343 in June 2016, which called for an end to forced organ harvesting in China and recognized “persistent and credible reports of systematic, state-sanctioned organ harvesting from non-consenting prisoners of conscience in the People’s Republic of China, including from large numbers of Falun Gong practitioners and members of other religious and ethnic minority groups.”

Dear precious one, the best way to effectively connect with Jesus Christ is through prayer.  Please join me in praying the following prayer....Beautiful Savior, I am your servant. Please help me to live in Your love and be a blessing to someone today. I love you, Jesus!  Please, guide me to all who need help, so I may share with them Your Holy Word and the light of Your Love.        To show, Kindness, to those who don't know warmth.       Love, to those who are stoned of heart.       Peace, to those in strife and conflict.        To be a light to Your Love, for those who are lost.        To help restore Faith, to those who are held by strongholds.        To call upon Your mighty mighty name my Lord.  So You and only You can deliver them, from their self built prison walls, of their heart, mind, body and soul.         Only You and You alone, Lord, can set us free. We trust You, we love You, we honor You, and we worship You. In Your Holy name Yeshua (Jesus the Christ) we pray!  Thank you Lord. Amen! ❤️❤️❤️

What Is the Romans Road to Salvation? “The Romans Road is a sort of roadmap through various gospel truths that someone, years ago, put together by selecting key verses out of Romans.” God’s plan for human salvation is communicated throughout the entirety of Scripture. For the most part, the Romans Road consists of essentially four parts. The Romans Road Bible Verses 1. The Human Problem (Romans 3:10, Romans 3:23, and Romans 6:23). The first part of the Romans Road confirms the state of every human as sinful and the state of God as holy. “As it is written: “There is no one righteous, not even one;” (Romans 3:10) “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,” (Romans 3:23) After establishing that “all have sinned,” the first half of Romans 6:23 explains the depth of this problem and its consequences. “For the wages of sin is death…” (Romans 6:23a) However, the second half of the verse hints at the hope sinners have for salvation through Jesus. “…but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Romans 6:23b) 2. Humanity’s Hope in Christ (Romans 5:8). The second part of the Romans Road further explains the hope we have in the love of God expressed through Christ.  “But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” (Romans 5:8) 3. The Sinner’s Response (Romans 10:9-10 and Romans 10:13). Once we understand our need for a savior and recognize that Jesus Christ is that savior, we can respond by moving along to the third part of the Romans Road, calling out to Jesus. “If you declare with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.” (Romans 10:9-10) This response is possible for everyone. Romans 10:13 expresses God’s ability to save everyone. (His intention to save everyone is further expressed in John 3:16-17) “For, ‘Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.’” (Romans 10:13) 4. The Result of Salvation (Romans 5:1-2; Romans 8:1). The fourth part of the Romans Road mentions two results (peace and justification) after a sinner decides to declare and believe in their heart that Jesus Christ is Lord. Romans 5:1-2 explains that through faith in Jesus Christ, sinners can enjoy peace with God, no longer separated from holy God by sin. “Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand.” (Romans 5:1-2)  Romans 8:1 rejoices in the result of salvation. Before faith in Christ, all who have sinned were condemned by their sin and destined for death. But now with faith in Christ, “there is no condemnation” (Romans 8:1) and believers are gifted eternal life with God (Romans 6:23). “Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus,” (Romans 8:1)
i didnt think we won at first, was so shocked we didnt mess up penalties 😅
You are all close to face the true but most of you sleepy or drank ...just wake up and looking for reason why you are in the earth ( thank you god for guide me to be pray you always )
This is the Most Important post you will ever read;  Every one of us has broken God’s moral law, the Ten Commandments. We’ve all lied and we’ve all stolen, which makes us liars & thieves; And James 2 : 10 states that even breaking just one of these commandment makes us guilty of breaking them all.   The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because The Creator is perfect in holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in justice, meaning not a single sin will go unpunished; and our penalty for sin is death & hell, which the Bible describes as Eternal fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in love, so 2000 years ago Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. Here, he lived a perfect & sinless life, only to take the punishment that we deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, & endured a painful death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. On the third day, he conquered death & rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of Gods judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace; except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..  So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, & through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old ways. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, & the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9), and you will be saved.   The moment you do this, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds pleasure in sin, & also, he will grant you eternal life in his presence; Nothing on this earth even close to compares to what awaits believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY.. meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make. And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true .  Jesus Christ is awaiting YOU right this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you have surrendered to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. and as it is written(Hebrews 9 : 27);   ‘it is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’    All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ

I really like the kicking order. Usually they’d stick kane up first to get off to a good start but it was clever to pick Dier first then let Harry take one in business end.

I have lost interest in watching football these days since COVID-19 restrict fans from coming to the stadium to make these great sports fun and lively... everything seems so boring, the yelling during most games these days because there were no noise of the fans to drown out those yellings, I mean when was the last time you hear the horrible sound of the goal post net when a penalty is scored? Everything seems so weird to be honest. F-**k COVID-19

Every time I see a person wearing a mask, I realize how incapable people of this generation has become to recognize a rogue country.  A rogue country which:  - Creates a deadly virus and spreads it across the world through human carriers  - Hides death toll numbers from WHO to let it spread  - Sells (not donates) faulty medical equipment to countries, putting the lives of its frontline doctors in danger   When the whole world is fighting coronavirus, it is:  - Committing human right violations against its own citizens  - Not letting Muslims to practice their religion  - Bullying small countries  - Encroaching on land and seas of neighboring countries  - Stealing intellectual property  - Arresting reporters and banning media  - Trapping weak countries through high interest debt  Are we all going to just witness this bully to dominate the whole world and do nothing.   FOR HOW LONG????

As a diehard Arsenal fan, a tip of the hat to the Spurs. I have grown to hate Chelsea more than the Spurs and I truly enjoyed this.
Not fair. Should've included the most interesting thing that happened in the game : Dier's loo drama.

Titus‬ ‭2:13-14‬ ‭KJV‬‬ “Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;  Who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto Himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.” ‭‭  John‬ ‭3:3, 5-7‬ ‭NKJV “Jesus answered and said to him, “Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”  Jesus answered, “Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.   That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.   Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’” ‭‭‬‬  John‬ ‭14:6-7‬ ‭NKJV‬‬ “Jesus said to him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.   “If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and from now on you know Him and have seen Him.”” ‭‭  ‭‭1 John‬ ‭2:22-23‬ ‭CEB‬‬ “Who is the liar? Isn’t it the person who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This person is the antichrist: the one who denies the Father and the Son.   Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father, but the one who confesses the Son has the Father also.”   John‬ ‭3:14-18‬ ‭NKJV‬‬ “And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,   that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.   For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.   For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved..”   Here is proof that God is real and a testimony from an ex-satanist.

Shame on lampard.. In his playing time was he playing his balls backwards? Chelsea was good at playing the balls backwards with defenders, scared to launch attack... What a very outing for Chelsea, no confidence, no accuracy.. Shame on them
Great performance Check out Kenyan migos 💥 https://youtu.be/3GKvOlf1dyM
Chelsea should have decided the game before Lamela's tap in
3:02 Lamela Goal Aurier:"PUTAAA"
Hmm... if Lamela plays this well game in, game out, then Bale can go play ...... golf!
When the next step please ??
Damn it this is trending in India , never expected it
The argentinien guy is so talented 👏❤️
Recoment  https://youtu.be/ahHPJmZEHWo
New player regullion seems to be wonderful signing, he was the reason for the  first goal and surely is the reason for the second goal, there is a big difference in him and Davies, Davies has to fight for his place now. Future of Spurs is looking rosy.

Never let rival fans tell you these kind of games dont matter. Look at the reactions from both sets of players. Spurs players delighted. Mason Mount looked totally distraught. It was "just" a league cup 4th round game.

My best player in totenham is Lamela.
Let's go spurs
Did Lloris get a hand on that last penalty?
1:40 If I had a selfish player like that on my team I would substitute him off after that., but selfish and chelsea have always gone good together.

Friday, June 1st, 2012    08:15 pm   적그리스도는 이미 중동에서 확산되는 전쟁과  희망이 없어보이는 끔찍한 고통의 때에 자신이 소개할 평화의 계획을 준비하고 있다.  적그리스도는 갑자기 출현할 것이고  암흑의 중심부에서 반짝이는 밝은 보석인 평화의 인간인 듯  세계에 자신을 소개할 것이다.  그자는 모든 시간 중에 가장 카리스마있는 정치 지도자처럼 보여질 것이다.  그는 핸섬하고 매력있고 배려하는 성격으로 대부분의 사람을 속일 것이다.  그는 사랑과 연민이 스며 나올 것이며 그리스도인으로 보여지게 될 것이다.  때가 되면 메시아인 나처럼  그들의 수로 성장하는  많은 추종자들을 끌어 당길 것이다.  그가 모든 민족 사이에 화합을 촉진시키는 것으로 보여질 것이고, 전 세계 거의 모든 국가에서  사랑받을 것이다.  그런 다음 그는 초자연적인 능력을 보여줄 것이고, 많은 사람들이 그가 하느님께서 보내신 인류의 구세주인 나,  예수 그리스도라고 믿을 것이다.  사람들은 그에게 기도할 것이고  그를 사랑하고  그를 위해 자신들의 삶을 포기할 것이다.   그러나 그는 사람들이 자신을 보지 않는 데서는 그들을 향해  웃고 조롱할 것이다.  이것은 인류 역사의 시간 중에 가장 큰 속임수이며  그 계획은 나로부터 너희를 떼어내기 위해  너희 영혼을 훔치기 위한 것이다.  그 적그리스도와 거짓 선지자는 베드로 자리에 왕처럼 앉아  비밀리에 하나의 세계 종교로  음모를 꾸밀 것이다.  이것은 사랑을 촉진시키는 그리스도교 형태의 종교인 것처럼 보여질 것이지만  그러나 그것은 서로를 사랑하라고 하신 하느님으로부터 오는 것이 아니며 대신 적그리스도에게 충성과 사랑을 촉진시킬 것이며  자신 스스로를 사랑할 것을 촉진할 것이다.  그들이 하느님의 자녀들을 꾀어냈을 때 공격이 시작될 것이기에 ​그 혐오스러운 것은 멈추지 않을 것이다.   갑자기 충성의 단일 세계 마크에 동의 하도록  요구될 것이다.  모든 사람이 하나로 연합된 단일 세계에  참여해야만 할 것이다.  그것은 너희의 돈과 음식과 삶을  통제할 것이다.  그 규칙들 중 많은 것들이 너희가 포로가 될 것을 의미할 것이다.   너희를 그들의 지배 아래 있게 하는 너희에 대한 감옥방의 열쇠는 짐승의 표가 될 것이다.  666 그 수는 숨겨져 너희가 어떠한 예방 접종인 것처럼 받아들이도록 강제되어질 칩 속에 박혀질 것이다.  일단 그것이 박혀지면 너희의 마음과 영혼 뿐만이 아닌 육체 또한 독살할 것이다.  왜냐하면 그것은 전 세계의 많은 인구를 없애버리기 위해 고안된  전염병을 일으킬 것이기 때문이다.  너희는 그 표를 받아들여서는  안된다.   대신 나는 너희가 무엇을 해야할 지  알려줄 것이다.  많은 사람들이 속수무책으로 그 표를  받아들일 것이다.  살아계신 하느님의 인호인 내 십자군 기도(33)는 너희의 생명줄이다.  내 영원하신 아버지에 의해 주어지는 보호막인 내 인호를 받을 때, 너희는 그 표를 받아들이지 않아야만 할 것이다.  너희를 건드리지 못할 것이다.  사탄의 군대에 의해 보여지지 않게 될 것이기 때문에  너희의 집은 보이지 않을 것이고 찾지 못할 것이고  타겟이 되지 못할 것이다.  너희는 몇 년동안 지속될 식량을  숨겨둬야만 할 필요가 있을 것이다.  너희는 작물을 기르고 물을 저장하고  거룩한 성물을 지녀야만 한다.  내 남아있는 교회는 성장하고 확산될 것이며  필요한 경우 피난처를 받을 것이다.  ​많은 계획이 지금 필요하다.  너희가 행하는 것을 비웃는 저들은 그것이 아니면 설마 너희에게 이를 행하라고 예수님이 요청하지 않았을 것이라 말하는 것이냐?  그들이 필요로 하는 시간에 예수님이 그를 따르는 자들 모두에게 공급해주지 않는다는 것이냐?  내가 너희를 보호하고 안전하게 지켜줄 것이기에  약간의 음식만 있다면  그것은 문제될 것이 없을 것이다.  빵 한 덩어리와 물고기 하나만 있어도  내가 그 음식을 불려줄 것이다.  그 표를 피할 수 없는 사람들을 위해  열심히 기도하여라.  칩을 받아들이도록 강제되는 시점에  은총 지위에 있는 순진 무구한 영혼들은 구해질 것이다.  나머지 사람들은 너희의 가족을 그리고 거룩한 성체 성사와 미사에 대한 너희의 충성을 보호하기 위해  계획해야만 한다.  적그리스도가 모든 종교를 집어삼키려 할 때 적그리스도를 무력하게 만드는 유일한 무기는  거룩한 미사와 그리고 빵과 포도주가 거룩한 성체 성사에서 내 몸과 피로 변화되는  성 변화이다.  나의 미사 성제는 계속 되어야만 한다.  이것을 아는 사람들은 사람들을 모아  준비를 시작해야 한다.  너희는 너희에게 속하는 사람들을 더 증가시키기 위해 너희에게 주는 은총을  더 다급히 모아야한다.  적그리스도 세력들은 새로운 건물로 이루어진 혐오스러운 것을 내 새로운 성전이라고 말할 것이다.   그러나 이것은 사실이 아니다.  그러나 박해가 끝날 때 내 남은 교회와 내 선택된 사람들은  재건된 성전을 가지게 될 것이고  새 예루살렘은 하늘로부터 내려올 것이고  영광에 둘러싸여 올 것이다.  그리고 천국과 지상에서 동시에 나팔 소리를  들을 것이다.  그런 다음 내가 올 것이다.   내 자녀들은 나의 재림을 알릴 것이고 땅에 주저앉아 구원의 황홀감으로 사랑과 기쁨에 찬 눈물을 흘릴 것이다.  나 예수 그리스도는 심판관이 되어 올 것이다.  그리고 하늘과 땅은 하나가 될 것이다.  새로워진 지구에 영광스럽고 장관을 이루며 나타날 것이고 새 천국은 생명의 책에 이름이 기록된 사람들을  품을 것이다.  반면 죄악으로 더럽혀지고 죽어야 할 옛 지상은 끝이 나고 새 시대가 시작될 것이다.  오직 모든 영혼들의 구원에 초점을 맞추어라.  그것이 너희들에게 가해지는 장애물을 무시해야하는 이유이다.  박해,고통  악마가 다른 사람을 이용하여 너희에게 주는 공포 그 모든 문제는 영혼 구원이다.                             -너희의 구세주-                             예수 그리스도              살아계신 하느님의 인호인 내 십자군 기도(33)는 너희의 생명줄이다.                    ( 기도 번호 33번)  나의 하느님, 사랑하올 아버지시여, 나는 하느님의 신성한 보호의 인호를 사랑과 감사의 마음으로 받사옵나이다.  하느님의 신성이 나의 몸과 영혼을 영원히 에워싸나이다. 나는 사랑하올 아버지이신 당신께 겸손되이 감사드리고 엎드려 경배드리오며 나의 깊은 사랑과 충성을 바치나이다.  이 특별한 인호로써 나와 내가 사랑하는 사람들을 보호하여 주시기를 간청하나이다.  나는 아버지께 드리는 공적인 흠숭에 영원히 내 생명을 서약하나이다.  나는 하느님 아버지를 사랑합니다. 나는 이 시대에 사랑하는 아버지 하느님께 위로를 드리나이다.  세상의 죄에 대한 보속과 하느님의 모든 자녀들의 구원을 위해, 나는 아버지께서 지극히 사랑하시는 당신 아들 우리 주 예수 그리스도의 몸과 피, 영혼과 신성을 바치나이다.  아멘."

Intense Penalty shootout! Puff!
What the hell is chelsea playing at? First they let Young Tariq Lamptey go to brighton, what a prospect..Then Willian is allowed to go, one quality technical player, he was never appreciated at Chelsea. He'll do well at Arsenal..Breaking news Ross Berekley loaned out to Villa..Hes a class player needs to be on the pitch, Not a bench warmer.At EVERTON  he was an England player, looked set for years.Look at Danny Drinkwater got his england callup during leicesters championship win..Chelsea paid 40 million, ok he had a few injuries, guess what another bench warmer.Chelsea ruined his england career, and his football career..Far to many overseas players coming in, sqeezing out the young academy players..Tammy comes on, goes a few games without scoring, hes back on the bench.Not good for a players confidence..They dont know the system' or formula they want to play..Ive got no patience with them..You just watch Ross Berkley shine at Villa Park.Mark my words' if Ross is on fire at Villa Park, Chelsea will not let him go , without a very high fee..
0:34wow 🔥💪👍😎😁

What a performance with a much changed spurs team against a full Chelsea team ! Well deserved get in there boys 💙
Jose you know your work as a coach nice one. You have to do the same thing on Thursday so that we have good players on Sunday so we win against Man United
3:52 this is what we like to see 🤧🥳
Nice game from Chelsea great job Chelsea I think chealsea should have won it
Tottenham berselebrasi layaknya juara champions league
Finally seeing
finally chelsea can say they did not have a embarrassing keeping error in the game like they did against my fav club (liverpool)😂😂
Mendy did amazing on his debut better than kepa*
Frank's not learning Huson Adoi as tricky as he is, is not going to win you games! He has no finish , another Wright Phillips. Tammy isn't a top 6 striker period. Results based game, lampard will come undone with his narrow-mindedness.  Over 50 years of football watching here.
Is this chelsea five star line up or
Eric Lamela is our man
Nice erik lamela
They will probably make a dvd about this win lol
I believe in Mourinho.....Spurs will definitely finish with a silverware in their hands this season....
This why chelsea are the smallest club in london
Everyone is shooting at the same place and gk are dump not dump they should have known

After Penalty shoot out, Eric Dier approached to Mason Mount, What a great Sportsmanship. !   RESPECT !

Kepa kemana woy . Kiper goblok kagak bisa penalti
0:38 Mount was smiling way too much when reguilon slid. Lmao, whos smiling now. xD
Kinda fair result thou. Both team lost their best players.
Yappy Frank at it again eh?  His churlish behavior is becoming commonplace nowadays. Perhaps it's the pressure of having spent a fortune, to no visible effect? Well done Spurs.
Congrats  Spurs! Chelsea Will only get stronger, keep your head up
Both teams were equally strong
Tottenham should have more respect
Amazing

CHELSEA'S ITINERARY THIS SEASON: Carabao Cup : Out FA Cup : Lady luck required Premier League : Tough Champions League : No chance/Dream on Conclusion : No silverware this season Recommendation : Hire a more quality,calibre and experienced manager Solution : Sack the current manager  cc: Roman Abramovich, Board of Director
The decision making at 1:43 is the reason English players don't win for club and country
JOSSSSSS
I still can't get over game againt Newcastle originally we won 3 min before dier handball there was handball first from Newcastle player

I don't know why I'm so excited about this win..   😍 😍 😍
After the penalty shootout was Dat glory glory spurs? 😂😂😂 Did they jus rob man utds anthem? 😂
Why don't you substitute bale to pitch???
Wish they didn’t tell you the scores on the video title
Still struggling to understand why we were defending for large swathes of the game against a Chelsea side managed by a Frank Lampard who was turned into a World Class footballer by this same Mourinho who's also got more experience managing at elite level than Lampard. Don't know what's wrong here - players not good enough or a gaffer who's playing philosophy clearly doesn't fit into the 21st Century?

If Timo scores that team never wins..😆😆😆 hit like if you agree
Honestly all you mad people who moan about lamela but every time he plays he scores or creates big chances. Always been a fan of him cant understand why so many people dont like him 🤦
Did Frank become petulant again when he lost?
Just Win With 2nd Team...Clearly Tactical Masterclass
You will get beat on the weekend. Glory man utd.
where joe hart?
Feeling pity for chelshit fans, they  spend more than 200 plus millions in this transfer window and still trophy less again this season. What a shame 🤣
Anyway why Don't Mourinho change his 3-5-2 instead of 4-2-3-1????? Our full backs are better than Midfielders 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Some PATIENTS bring CORONAVIRUS to KENYA
Where's Bryan El ??? 😅😅😅😅😅 He changed Spurs to Chelsea fan...... And roasting our Spurs fans ......   AND NOW...... IS HE GOT ROASTED BY THIS MATCH????😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I missed this game as I took a stand. Virtual signalling has no place in sport. As soon as I seen it, I turned the program off..... the point was made months ago, no need to rub it in our faces!!
All are hitting left side
why was almost everyone aiming for the bottom right corner? 😂😂

(United) Good job Spurs, you guys deserved that win.
https://youtu.be/1vNH9fW5_Gs
Wtf darude sandstorm
F*ck Chelsea..
If Spurs can avoid the same injury issues as last season, this could be very good. They have done well in the window, and Højbjerg has really given the team some stability, and Ndombele is waking up. Kane, Son, Bale, Højbjerg, Lo Celso, Ndombele, Doherty, Reguilon, Alderweireld, Lloris and so on. Great team!
Just Jorginho and Kane penalty was diferent
2:07 Song??
Celebrations at the end, Regullion must be wondering what happens if finals are won in this country and how we celebrate. Lets hope we find out by the end of the season 💙🤍💙🤍
Mason Mount is a very young player, the miss would have badly hurt his confidence. Eric Dier went to comfort him instead of celebrating, legend.
Pure class from Dier at the end, going over to console Mason Mount.
I thought Lampard was a better coach than Ole, and really thought they would finish 3rd hands downs. Wow, he turned out to be a fraud!
1:57 Darude - sandstorm  LoL 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Arsenal ❤forever
They are all coming together, that celebration shows it all. how much it meant for them. I mean after a long long time spurs are never giving up, coming back strong, and showing a good mentality. The manger is working for the team and the team is working for the manager. with the good support from the boss levy. Exciting time.#coys
Lamedla: I need a goal Dier: I need a shit Both just as important
I m a real Madrid fan but I feel happy for SPURS..To dare is to do.
I just came here to see dier running off to toilet in middle of the game 😂
ayyyy I rlly thought Spurs would lose but not today see yall in da semi!!!!!!!
All PENALTIES at the left corner
Cmon Spurs 🥳🥳
I am happy for ur sweet sweet revenge. Mourinnho!!! Next, u have to beat man. united then I become happy.
bastard spurs
Hugo should have saved Chelsea’s first goal. Wasn’t that far from him. No good standing on your knees
Reguilon, Lamela and Gedson were brilliant They are showing big signs of a possible amazing season coming for them
How did we win that? Idk but we did 😂
Mendy capte them in the game
We r lucky guys, come on.  Odoi was selfish didnt pass to Tammy.  Odoi shooting was also garvage.  Luckily Emerson didn't know how to defend givi g away goal to us. Thanks.
why jose didnt play joe hart in carabao cup?
Lol, did they really played the sandstorm?
Why is Lloris getting the pats on the back?. He didn't get close to one penalty.
COYS 💙💙💙
Why bale isn't playing 😕
My goodness, Reguilon has a motor on him.
*lamela scores* damn.. nice.. *DARUDE SANDSTORM STARTS PLAYIN* SHIT JUST TURN FROM MEH TO AMEHZING
Why son didnt play ? I hate when mourinho destroying player career when he managing a club
lampard should go....
Spurs could have won in 90 min if they don't miss chances  Not needed to go to penalties
Prank lampart 😂
darude - sandstorm
EPIC TOTTENHAM , they could crush Liverpool if they played like this.
Spurs a defender down.. 1:40 first spurs player i heard or may in spurs history went out during a match.. lol

Fuck Chelsea
Get reguilon and aurier/Doherty to keep playing that high with a three at the back and encourage Toby and dier to play the big balls across, have had so much success with it under poch why completely stop now?
Haahaaaaa  coys
What??! Where is the biggest highlight of the match? Dier doing "not just a pee"!!

where's Bale 🤔
Undeserved win

Who tf thought playing sandstorm darude was a good choice when Spurs equalised
hudson odoi is a selfish player. chelsea could have finished the game 2-0
I'm happy
Mendy is clearly not 6ft6 ,more like 6ft2. Chelsea should request a refund for misleading product information.
How omg

Just can't believe we won without Son&Kane. We've been showing excellent performance during the last few games, hope we win a title soon
Why do Spurs fans always have to endure that droning twat Alan Smith, he is a gooner and we have no interest in his boring biased drivel

Well, congratulations for Tottenham, but I didn't like the performance that Tottenham showed up. Shelsea deserve win in my opinion. Morinho can't walk so far with this kind of performance, this is not performance for high competition.
Good those cunts didn't win
Chelsea Goalkeeper  superb maybe must improve  in penalty situation
Jangan lupa ngising
woa 😮😮
Lamela finally getting chances ..
Congratulations, team, even though i missed Sony and Harry Winks.
What happened to Eric ? sorry I didn’t watch the game .
I loved how spurs player seems so happy. And in the other hand, chelsea got so much pressure for not winning several games while spending over 200m
WHY DONT YOU HAVE DIER SHITTING COYS

Not gonna lie I am happy for Jose as a Chelsea fan. Hope he can win this Cup for Spurs, you lot have improved a bunch imo. Great recruitment, could even be better if Levy wasn't such a penny pincher though

Reguilon is wonderful
Chelsea still can't win with Werner, Mendy and Chilwell Jose is still class after all compared to FJ
Imagine losing to our b-team after spending 200 million
Can't beleive they have stolen the "Glory Glory" song from Man United 😂
Awesome match, reguilon was the key player for tottenham. GO GO SPURS
Mendy duk bersila apa
I knew mount was gonna fucking miss
Chelsea are so average it's not even funny...a poor man's mancity ..all money and hype and zero final result ...Lampard could get sacked before Christmas with such averageness when u have spent millions on overrated mercenaries ...a spurs depleted team beats them ,imagine their drubbing in front of superior teams !
이게 토트넘이지
Fuck Chelsea
Where Garet Bale?
Ndombelle was perfect. He must be a key player for spurs.
They all went the same bloody way except for Kane's i guess
lampard out😂😂😂😂
Chelsea was nothing before Mourinho, and now Spurs is becoming a world elite team. Biggest mistake Man U did was sack this guy...

Why is nobody talking about the fact that all the pens went into the same area
Lampard out...
Lamela better then Son
Both teams no 11 scored in the match
The truth be told don't barry your head in the sand assume all was well, the assist from Reguilon and the score from lamela washed there names because they were shit on this game. Reguilon blunder caused Tottenham go down in first half gave away alot of miss passes. Lamela was selfish and not clinical enough, kept falling down each and every time. Fernandez and tanganga were also other culprits of stupid school boy errors. Others fairly played well and if we're not those substitution, Tottenham were in deep trouble.
1:59 When serge yells “Puta” to Erik in Spanish lmao

Smh what about Dier's poo break
03:46 I heard "Glory glory man united"
Where oppa Son
Tottenham has strong formation 4-3-3 Loris,toby,eric dier, aurier, regulion, Tanganga, lamela, ali, son/lucas, kane, bale
오늘의 승자는 다이어입니다.

I still don't understand how Jose wins games with that kind of starting Lineup
1: reguilon first assist,first game 2: if we can see bale's full potential again 3-defence is gonna cry,building a fortress like in fortnite.
Cheers to 200 Million
Omg Tottenham defense is trash, but Reguilon is a beast!!!!!

Yeah, Tottenham won. Tottenham has a chance to win the EFL Cup. One day, i saw in news that Kane want some silverware. If he does not so he will leave. Tot has a chance For UEL and EFL cup!!
Syukur lah..
Even if I look at it impartially, Spurs were the better team and deserved the win. That said it was a close one, congrats to the lads!
COYS
needed o2.5 goals :(
Terrible game.We got that goal by chance.  Lamela is selfish and he sucks  Ndombele is reckless with the ball. Seems like everyone has forgotten how to pass. In the 1st half we didn't put pressure at all. Bad game
Coys
Spurs fans if u read this:We hve the best LB in the PL mark my words😀💪💪💪

I thought that we would give a chance to academy promoted players because of tough scedule we have,but glad that half-benched people managed to win against chelsea first squad.Although we have to be more concentrated against maccabi and then,we'll see.This year ,at least UEL is ours👊👊
Great Tott! You made it without Son.
Lamela played really well!
Everton is the real blue👍
Brilliant.    Shaky start from reguilon but man he improved great cross by him for lamela score. Brilliant
Deservedly won. Chelsea been fouling the whole game

Darude Sandstrorm ? Genuis! XD
I cannot see properly from the highlights. Did Hugo get a fingertip to Mount's pen? Or it was jus wide?
Thank you Mendy, for going left to let us put 4 to his right and for going right to let us put the 5th to his left.  Impressive display otherwise.
Mendys reading is dodge 4 out of 5 pens went bottom left
I think Lorris saved the penalty kick from Mount😪
한국인 좋아요누러라

3:41 nice music lol
Aurier diciendo: "Vamoooos, putaa" me ha alegrado el día jajajajauauaja
X lame la lampard kalau berterusan macam ni😂
Reguillon is going to be a great addition when he plays alongside Bale/Son in the 11. With them running at defenders, reguillon will have plenty of opportunities to barge forward with overlap runs. And from this performance, he sure seems to love that kind of a role. Will be interesting to see how Jose balances his involvement offensively/defensively.
We are going to win a cup this year, I know it
Cant wait to see son+kane in next match
joe hart MOURINHO PLEASE
0:14 what a turn🔥
Why's Man United Theme song played on the background after the penalties in the Spurs Stadium?? 😂

Mendingan lah kiper chelsea yg baru bisa sampai adu penalty kalau keppa udah lebih dari 1goal gk sampai adu penalty
Darude Sandstorm everytime they score😂
I’m so happy for Reguilon, one of Real Madrid expendables; as a merengues’ supporter, it isn’t nice to contemplate how impressively talented players are treated unfairly by the club. Greetings from Bogotá.
Where is son ? What happen to him ?
Hugo was gonna catch that last penalty he already knew where Mason was going.

COYS!!! Cheers from Portugal! 🇵🇹🇬🇧
nice job guys!!!!!!!!!
Lamela need to play more. I like this player
Why no one club to pick kane for their club, kane was beller and hes should get the title
https://youtu.be/8zPHR8Z_oXI
The pressure on Mount must've mounted too much ...Dem penalties..
We desperately need Sonny!!
Enak amat baru main sekaliii,gak adil ah fa
Nobody: ...  Both keepers: Let's dive to the left all the time and change to the right on the final kick.
Penaltine wagu 😅
U gotta feel bad for Chelsea GK. 4 Tottenham players when taking penalties shot to the left of Mendy and Mendy went to the right, Kane shot to the right and Mendy went to the left. Chelsea GK was bullied in penalties.
Who the fuck decided to play sandstorm when Lamela scored? XD
I dead later game
Where is bale wanna see his debut !!!!
Reguilon? More like Reguigone LOOOOOOOOL
when will bale be played
Hell yeah! Lets go
Can Werner score like this in the prem so I can get som fpl points please
Reguilon haciendo de las suyas :)
One good thing  about spurs  Hugo lorris
Dier is having diarrhea
When does Gareth bale play
Regi is refreshing to watch!
Wow, so many Chelsea fans. Get a life!
Spurs acting like they won something
베르너는 역시나 클라스가 있네
where did tanguy go during the celebration cuz i didn’t see him run up
이걸이기네ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
손흥민 부상으로 없다..😭
fantastic mendy from Chelsea
The sound of net when the ball goes in is one of  the satisfying thing to hear
Tottenham's defence is a mess
Without fans, is it any easier to take penalties?
What a save
모빡이 볼때마다 왜이리귀엽냐..
스포티비 개씨발
Well done, Tottenham!!!
Reguilon is a beastttt.
Dier 💩💩💩
3:37 the moment that make My day it was the Best of the Day #COYS #CarabaoCup #Spurs
IT is a very good win
Good
1,000 comment
As a Chelsea fan I must say, if Tottenham keeps playing like they have been for past 3 games, they will win europa league.
Still makes me laugh that they blast "SANDSTORM" in an empty stadium after each Spurs goal!
buying the players is not too much
Class act by Dier consoling Mount before celebrating with his teammates
That background song.. " Tottenham are the greatest team the world has ever seen"... 😍.. Im a new tottenham fan😇
0:33 German Precision, right there.
They should run and celebrate it with mount not Hugo Lloris...😅
3:51 Eric Dier walking towards Mason Mount (penalty missed..) aww that guy
eric "panggilan alam".. kikikiki
대다나다
Kurang banyak beli pemainnya cel😂😂
Mount should never take a penalty for chelsea nor for England.  He has the English curse when it comes to penalty
Spurs No.3 is on fire.
0:18 RIP defender.
Mampus donatur pembantu.y Israel kalah ,, biar dya rasaaa
Reguilon very nice COYS!!
Excuse me what was playing when Spurs scored?
ELOHIMEMBASSY E.T.👽 DAY FOR THE UMANITY 🌍⏳☝🏼☝🏼☝🏼☝🏼☝🏼☝🏼☝🏼↔️ THE SECOND COMING OF JESUS CHRIST SUPER STAR 👑🕳️👽
Why bale isn't playing
I think if the gk kepa spurs will wim 6 1
first of allm Reguilon gave up the first goal, he almost gave up another goal when Kante retained the ball, his corner was lucky bc it was weak asf sono, he did not play badass
Spurs need to replace dj that play celebration goal song. Oh Thiagoo silvaa...ohh thiagoo silvaaaa
Like
The new kid Regulion looks like he has been playing with these guys for years...he just gelled in hasnt he?
Chelsea's 200M € spending is still a worth?
개포티비 ㅅㅂ진짜
Jose's tactic in first half was spot on. He wanted to his team sit back and defend in order to conserve energy. Then go all out in the second half. With a rotational squad with no striker he managed to win Chelsea's almost first team squad. The Special One is shining ♥️♥️♥️
I have a feeling Tottenham will unleash the Welsh Dragon against United.  XD  But this team is  looking really cool now . I hope they win big trophies this season .
03:44 컴온!!!
한국어 댓글 달아도 되나 ㅎ
Reguilon has SO much energy.. WOW. And they say foreign players can't keep up with the pace of the English game?? LOL..
Son Heung Min ???🤔🤔🤔
Thanks for Reguilon and                     Mount
Regullion is a copy cat of Marcelo beast in offense but slow on tracking, marking.Hope he learn from Mourinho and come back to Madrid
With mourinho it's possible
SPURS 🔥🔥
It was a wonderful match between Spurs and Chelsea.
Darude sandstorm😂😂😂
The stones on Hojberg is absolutely insane. Coolest finish you'll see all day.
레길론 데뷔전 어시스트 출발 깔끔하네
Contratulation for you Jose
I recommend rick_tech98 on Instagram he helped me recover my Twitter account, And he also hacks all kind of social media accounts.

Yeah spurs!!!! coys!!! Lamela 💙💙💙
Yaah guys I am a spurs fan
Very persistent!!! I think it makes spurs different  in this season!
레귤론 잘샀네
why son no play
What's with that smile at 0:42 ,mount 😂
Ani Chelsea fans were happy to have mason mount 😂😂😂😂😂
where is son.....
Lloris! Lloris! What was he doing when the team lost the goal by Timo Werner?  Where the hell has his shouting spirit gone away when he shouted against Son for not run & run & run for the team?  He should have just tried diving for saving the goal. What a hypocrite.
wtf only harry kane and jorginho shot on right side
Azpilicueta send Reguillon to mars 🤣🤣🤣
Loris jago penalti
Glory Glory Tottenham Hotspur  Well done boys, time to reset, and focus on the next game
Spurs are really good but I doubt if they can challenge United if they don’t improve their mentality. Good job Mr Jose.👍👍👍
They celebrate like they already win that trophy 😂
"still alive here" LOL Manchester city are still alive here. BALOTELLI....
흥민이형 보고싶당 ㅠ 빨리나으세여ㅠ핼님
They play glory glory Tottenham Hotspur?? What glory hahaha
Good team
Wow mendy making a big difference for Chelsea.
wheres bale?
Heads up Mount
토트넘 화이팅❤️
Can this season be of spurs Let's hope so
You can tell how much it means to the boys. COYS!!!!
Kepa would have dropped the shot from reguilon   Srry if u spelled his name wrong
,,,https://youtu.be/3JCy8Y3xFE0
Mount is noob
One question : Where is son?
#COYS , glory glory Tottenham hotspurs .
did i hear "glory glory manchester united" music on stadium when tottenham celebrating the win ?
I miss son.
Imma man u fan but i support spurs in london And im not disappointed
축하한다 바보들 ㅠㅠ 레길론이랑 멜라도 잘했다
Berasa nonton pertandingan usiran di Liga 1.
Anjing lorr
MOUNT😔😭💔
All of THFC player shoot to left and Hary on right🙏👍
When the chelsea's keeper finally went down to his right, Kane shoots to his left
sometimes i really wonder why Lampard can takeoff players playing better than Mount BARKLEY is always our game changer but he is not given chances to prove him self
Finally the other players realize that if we want to win trophies everyone must score goals every game not just Harry and Son
Dier 1 toilet 1 pk. Well done~!!
Tough break for mount
dude, whats the song?, LMAO
축하합니다! 🇰🇷 한국인의 댓글을 찾았습니다.
Idont really see chelsea winning or reaching any cup finals with such mentality and poor football
I was so nervous to watch the game last night I just fell a sleep, I tuned into Instagram and saw the celebrations and I was like WTF. #COYS #COYS #COYS 😛😛😛😛😛😛😛
0:16 속도를 줄이면 같이 줄여야지 술라이딩 하고 자빠졌네
Where garet bale?
Good gk for chelsea
They played like shyt first half. Had to go to class during second half so I dont know how they played second half. But they won bravo.
If Pulisic and Ziyevh were available this could have gone a different way, but I'm absolutely ecstatic that we won today
What is the name of this commentator? Peter Drury?
Im watching Totenham game because of Gareth Bale team will be better with Bale Plz make his debut we have not seen him since long plzzz
1:46 that pass by toby
am starting to think chelsea just wasted a lot of money
좆포티비 대신 이거봅니다 ㅎㅎ
COYS
Apoyo a los Spurs desde México 💙💪
Can someone tell me the song in the background when spurs scored?
Hahahahahhahaahahahahaha chelsea sux
Motm dier 💩
스포티비 안올려서 왔다 손!
Mourinho mind game agains lampard
YEAHAHAHAHHHAH LETS FUCKING GOOOOO YOU SPURSSSSSS
Funny how both GKs done shit all during penalties yet when the final miss happened they go and celebrate with GKs. GKs should go and celebrate with them FFS
Besides getting sent to the shops by aspi, Regulion played a outstanding game
We need sonny.
요리스 선방이냐 삑사리냐
Reguilon with a fantastic debut. Great team performance
Hahahaha raja seri ni team haha
ㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡ
스포티비보다 빠르다 야발
No Sonny No Partyy ....
Lamela is extremely underrated
I believe Tottenham can win this season. Fighting !!!
Sandstorm
Perfect match 👌
how come both keepers dive only to the left??? is there an object on the right???
One thing I've learned as an avid football watcher- never underestimate jose mourinho. Spurs 4-1utd in 36 mins. What'd i tell you !!!!
Each time spurs is getting better REGUILON IS a BEAST wait until bale gets on tho
Spurs are gay
Eric Dier is a real nice man 3:49 (In the background)
0:16 Jang Hyun Su
Come on!!!!!!!!!
time to bring on Ousmane Dembele. we need some speed upfront 💪
Chelsea is in big trouble
Áo chelsea rất là đẹp

Cant wait to see tot's full force beat the shit out of Liverpool
다이어 똥싸러가는거 어디임
경기중에  똥싸러 가지마라  죽고싶냐
glory goley man united
cool that  you won but it was cool that taht heung min son played
I wonder what this team will do when Bale will be back on field ! Wow !
I think I see Dier go over to Mason Mount to console him a bit right after. Class move.
good game..win or lose chelsea still my fav team..forever
Reguilon is fantastic
토트넘~♡~8강~축하축하~♡♡♡
М О Л О Д Ц І
HARRY is TOTTENHAM's ace
pls son back up
Do you hear the song ? Its united song,s😂
It's good to celebrate wining with joy.
South Korean fans will watch the highlights here lol 'cause SPOTV isn't working as usual nowadays.  Big win for the team, nice debut for Reguilon! I believe the lads can play better and better +hope Sonny can come back soon. Come on you Spurs
스포티비보다 더 빠르네
Warner scored chealse lost # Fact But respect him he is a great player.
Chelsea losing after spending 200million on players
Funny how everyone talking bad about Dier all of a sudden have changed their opinions. You guys were already leaving him off your dream line up for skrinniar.
，
손흥민없이 토트넘이 해냈다  다음경기엔 손흥민이 해내자  Go Spurs! Go Son!
이걸 이기네ㅋㅋㅋ
Spurrs had the lucky touch...
죽인다 토트넘 일단해보자
SON IS NEW KING OF ENGLAND!! 1st goal right foot 2nd goal left foot 3rd goal right foot 4th goal left foot This isn't even his final form. Wait till he becomes Heung Max Son!
👍👍
영상 고마워요 thank you♥
Just can't wait for Son- Kane - Bale trio...!
3:49 Dier goes immediately to console Mount after he misses. Class player :)
New Chealsea keeper.... solid.
페널티 성공률 왜케 높은데?
Glory Glory Tottenham Hotspur???
Edouard mendy did really good in my opinion, do you agree with me? even tho they did lost.
레길론 개 잘해
I died when they play darude sandstorm 🤣🤣
Wow even after spending all that you cant beat spurs 2nd team
Just lucky
WAY TO GO SPURS AND CHELSEA
레길론 미쳤누;;;
But I have missed our hero Son 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
여기서 보자 ㅋㅋ
Chelsea missed many chances.
Love to see Lamela gradually getting back to the player he once was.
Yesss, come onnnn !! Great result after losing 4 times previously in cup competitions to the chavs - We move on
We should remember sonny
When is bale playing
Was really gonna write reguilon as a flop but his second half was fantastic
1:04 kepa wouldnt have saved that
Lmao reguilon slided straight back to sevilla on that tackle 😆
Beautiful game should not have murderous penalties to decide a winner. Heartbreaking for losing side.
GOOD JOB TOTTENHAM! ❤
#Son out, Lamela in
Fantastic debut by Reguilon🔥
Mendy is already better than both goal keepers of Chelsea
Nice tottenham i like you
수비진 개에반데;;
Down down spurs🙅  #COYG
Can anyone tell me why ain't Bale playing?
Good teamwork, good manager, good team.... Lampard is failed
Why would Chelsea hire a former MLS player as their manager?
Bruh darude sandstorm hahaha
Super Spurs,Super Team..Super Cross from New Player Debut REGUILON and Finalize by LAMELA
Gedson tripped by the keeper but no penalty.  VAR only works against Tottenham 🤦‍♂️
Song?? Darude- sandstorm
i'm happy that our performances are getting way better
레길론 제드손 호이비에르 모우라 은돔벨레 베르베인 토트넘 확실히 스쿼드는 두꺼워졌네
Pisstake. Bet on spurs to win. They won and I lost the bet...
Why are they playing the Manchester United glory song at the end??
Congratetulation Spurs
If I was goalkeeper I would have just jump to my right,  like 7 out 9 shots went one side
Lamela festejando el gol es lo mejor que se puede ver jajajaj
I swear, the sandstorm never disappoints
COYS
Edouard Mendy did a good match imo
Well done boys!!! Get tomorrow out the way and smash the Mancs on Sunday and I’ll be a happy man. An exciting time to be a Spurs fan!
스포티비보단 낫네
Where sonnnn??
Gory gory manu ???
Reguilón ❤️❤️🔥 #COYS
Chelsea is just lucky. If they still had Kepa as goalie, we would have won easily and without extra time ofc.
Hudson Odoi’s selfishness saved us haha. He could easily passed the ball to unmarked Tammy Abraham but luckily no.   Well fought Spurs won in the end with B team for most of the time! COYS!
3:50 - Respect right there. I like the sportsmanship
Our defence was so good!!
Van der sar v Chelseas goal keeper aka peace of shit van de sar spurs goal keeper aka dog shit
What would the premier league be without Spaniards?
Nobody talking about mendy, he played well
Chelsea fans are fucking worst in the world, they are not even human. Supporter of other clubs can blame, tease or hate Mourinho anyway they want, but not Chelsea. Without Mourinho, Chelsea is nothing. He made Chelsea a fearsome team which the so many trophies. I can't recall any Chelsea manager who has won more trophies than Mourinho in the last 2 decades, or even longer. Humans who are not grateful to, show no respect, or even to insult ot humiliate someone who shape you and made you, are no human. I would not even say they are dogs because this will be an insult to dogs as even dogs know to be loyal.  Fuck Chelsea, fuck Chelsea fans.
As a Madrid fan I’m glad to see reguilon preforming well best of luck to spurs
We are best in London~~!!! COYS
Dier-hea
There is  no  lion.  Just  .....
The greatest derby lontong
Great debut for Reguilon. Everyone played pretty well today. Eric Dier played great as well. Lamela had a horrible start slowing the attack down and losing the ball ending their own attacks but later picked his game up.
Im really glad they didn't argue with the guy that missed they're good teammates
What a series of sweet penalties...
You can’t lie Chelsea’s new keeper better than kepa
Spurs B team? haaaaa
Couldn’t beat our b team 😂
Come on you, Spurs!!!!
pinalty kick left side 🤣
Decent start for Mendy
쏘니ㅡㅡ^^
SON?
So coys stands for come on you shit Coyg
They really play sandstorm as a goal song 😂
Kepa IN :D
Damn congrats spurs for winning from a United fan came here to see u beat Chelsea very happy hopefully u guys win a trophy soon with jose

Ok i miss the game last night. Can anybody tell me why did when they againts crystal palace n it was 1-1 but didnt get penalty?  But this time got penalty? Whyy i just wanna know btw... Anywayy congrats spurs COYS!!!
Thank you Mount hahaha
00:10He look like Tomori Looooool🤣🤣
Where is son?
THIS IS MY CLUB, THE ONE AND ONLY MY CLUB #COYS
Jose is the best
Mourinho is doing something special here. With Reguilon, Hojbjerg, and Bale, we could seriously return to the UCL, and challenge in the Europa
literally every pen was in went in the same corner
Congratulations 👏🤩 totam
For all the salty Chelsea fans: you cant even beat west Brom and no surprise you cant beat us...
Chelsea has spend a fortune to build a disaster. That defence is just horrible.
Weres bale😤
Lamela Is Hardworking Player..Becoz That JM Love Him
Why chelsea is always beaten by spurs? Aren't they very huge club? Or just poop
Mendy best than Courtois
Son<lamela
That was some crappy goal keeping from both goalies.
Vamos Spurs
SPURS!!
How long has it been since Lamela scored a goal?
It's not a highlight Eric moment is the Main HIGHLIGHT moment
COYS!!!!!!!!⚪️🔵
Emerson nub

Emang bener ya kalau klub kecil itu butuh banyak adsense.. termasuk todtenham spurrs
Why this game has penalties?
Mete gol Lamela* Lamela: GOOOOOOL Hijos de puta jajajaja
Keyunte johnson is telling all spurs videos cuz he be salty as fuck
Something is definitely happening
What do you think about mendy ?
Darude Sandstorm..lol
Lamela is much better than an Asian with a hamstring injury, make the run !
Lampard out
No one cares about the carabao cup lol
3:58 알더 : 맞다 맞다 맞다
Wow. They can win without Son. 😂
Coba kipernya kepa, celsi kalah wkwk
Yes Tottenham Hotspur win
무버지..  이제야 깨달아요..
Wtf is lampard doing
Where the mount fanboys at now
개포티비 피해서오신분들 손
Mason CHOKE ARTIST
오 근데 베르너가 골넣었네 결과는 지긴 했지만 저 골맛을 알았으니 잘해줬으면 좋겠다
Kane looked like he was running to hug Mount.
I didn't know Tyron Woodley played soccer XD 0:10
I love this club!!! COYS!!!!
Every spur players scored the pk at the left hand corner sending mendy the wrong way until Kane...
Kghnn
Um, did they play fucking DARUDE SANDSTORM when Lamela scored?!
Kingsss
Krall
Mendy food debute
Son@-@
스포티비가 안올려줬는데 썸넬 땜에 들람 손

NICE

Glory Glory Tottenham Hotspur! #COYS
COYS
Lmfaooo did aurier really call Lamela a “puta” 😂
COYS!!!!!
스포티비보다 백 배 낫네
Why always Mount play? Ok why he play 90 minutes
No one will ever overtake rose but trust me Sergio is looking strong in his debut 💯. COYS
chelsea gk dives always in the same place kinda stupid
COYS!!!!!
오오!
Look at the emotion. It looks like we are winning the final
토트넘 2진한테 지냨ㅋㅋ
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮
a good game
what is the name of the song at 1:58
Aurier is just like: PUTAAAA
Today the Spurs penalty box was a special box🤣
3:29 Typical Harry Kane; always does a retarded hunchback maneuver... and delivers penalties brilliantly lol
Is this final?!
Believe Spurs will win the first major trophy for the first time since 2008 league Cup final ..
Fun game from both teams well played.
Tottenham Hotspur Karabao Cup   Congratulations on the quarterfinals!
Chelsea might have City syndrome too. Good going forward but defensively suspected. Mendy does not has penalty saving instinct. Hope Ancelotti watched Zouma and have second thoughts of buying. He is not the solution to Everton defence.
Yes!! COYS!
LO CELSO + NDOMBELE + REGUILON + SONNY + KANE + BALE =???
Yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!
When does Bale play?
#COYS
Song 2:10?
1:23 look at the Ball Boy :D
Great win, will be awesome for morale. We need to rest Kane soon. Can't afford him picking up another injury soon. Sign a striker for the love of the club, Levy!!!
Imagine if kepa was playing
Lamela is MOM🤣🤣
The announcer is so much more lively in this match
Mason Mount sucks so bad
Both my favorite club :")
jリーグ日本代表隆昌! アジア隆昌！
Lamela should keep his form.
Frank should focus on wining instead of always fighting other manager at the side line lol
Bale is gonna get us top 4 #coys
MOM: Dier
"Dier"rhea
Well done well done!
어케했누.. 토트넘은 마음을 비워야 이긴다.. 앞으로도 교체선수로 게임하자
ร้อง
Wish spurs goodluck, I really hope Son and Kane to win a title in their career
심판애미
Reguilon💙
Rehillion is lightning
Poor chelsea
스포티비없어도 볼수잇넹ㅋ
Great goalscorer needs awesome assister! Not bad for € 30m Madrid boy.
나이스 토트넘
We no need bale anymore.. We just want CB and ST
reguilon did a good job
That idiotic jump that is in fashion with some footballers doesn't look good it looks like an over excited four year old child adding an unnecessary movement to normal running because they are over excited. I love the fact these footballers do this and don't realise how much they are giving away about how childish and idiotic they are
Honestly, i hope spurs win a trophy so that all together we can bully the red manchester 🤔
I'm so happy we won
쏜 없어서 걱정했는데 다행이야😊😉🙃🙂🤩
Haverthod noob Werner noob Thiago noob LOL
레길론 열심히 뛰는게 보기 좋다ㅎ 이대로 올시즌 잘 해주길
U already know there about to be some salty Chelsea fans im ready
COME ON YOU SPURS LONDON IS OURS
주전도아닌 토트넘한테 졌네 우승후보 첼시!
Spurs with a another win
Regulion is brilliant i think we just need to sign skriniar to win a 🏆
How Gedson Fernandes is not awarded a penalty there is mind blowing it is literally physically impossible for the defender to touch the ball without bringing down the man on the way.
I think the signing of Bale has awoken the beast inside of Lamela
CMON YOU SPURS !
What's that song that played when Lamela scored?
Where is gareth bale?
Thank you Jose Mou
Win it please spurs
why the fuck does spurs like darude sandstorm so much
SEE MANY MOMMENTS BAD DEFEND ERIC DIER
Dier flushed the shit away
Remember  3 0 to Maccabi Haifa!
all I'm saying is look how composed Hojbjergs pen was and what a pen it was I think he can bring a calmness to our team and is a leader like Kane
he caused the goal againt us and assisted our own goal other than that, reguilon showed a great performance. the playing of the team in second half made our win well deserved. COYS
Surprised no one is talking about dier here 3:50
I wanted Son to be in the game. Who agrees?
Good Job Spurs. Just have a rest for next MATCHING with MANCHESTER.
Is bale going to play this year or what
Regilon is good player
Good tottenham 👏👏
I love tottenham
와 손흥민 없이도 승부차기에서 승리한다고?ㅎㄷㄷ
COYS💙💙💙💙💙
No Lo Celso, Son, Bale, Dele, down to 10 men with Dier going off for a toilet break, Kane coming on late but still manage to get past the Chelscum. COYS
Reguilon!!!! What a signing
스포티비 배가 쳐불렀네  하이라이트 보러 여기온다
I mean he didn’t concede a goal and scored his penalty, so what if dier needed to do his business
스포타비 하이라이트 안나와서 여기서 하이라이트 보러온 한국인 손
2:00 Aurier "Puta!!"
I heard that one of our players runs off to the bathroom 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️  💩💩💩 🧻🧻🧻  😅😅😅🤭🤭🤭

Gedson and bergwijn play together is nightmare

Cant stop loving my club!!!!!
Nicely done! Come on you Spurs!
Amazing game I feel like this is the year we will win something
Jose will get it done for us!
Jose Mourinho....jose mourinho....jose mourinho....jose mourinho......
It's good to see that Spurs can win a game against a strong team without Son #COYS
This is spurs
Let's gooooo!!!!!
Reguilon was attacking those half spaces like a beast. But spurs players are not used to seeing that and thats why he had less opportunities.
2군멤버로이겼네
The spurs are winning this i belive it
ok, how did we win on pens lol
COYSSSSS. WHAT A GAME
GLORY GLORY TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR AND THE SPURS GO MARCHING ON🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
COYS 💪 💪 💪 ⚪⚪⚪
Erik lamela!!!!!! please pass please pass!!!!!!!!!p~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ASS!!!!!!!!!!
1:53
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Tanguy rightly baffled by the ref playing "advantage" for Spurs in the buildup to that goal.
Son 😣😣
Reguilón's card on fifa is gonna be insane....
So many missed chances from both the sides, good game though.
Jose is changing the mentality of our team before our very eyes. COYS
1:45 Dier kkkkk
So much better without Skysports fake fan noises.
This is going to boost our confidence
스포티비 대신 이게 뜨네
COYSSSSSSSSSSS
We won against a 220m updated Chelsea with our B-team.. without a recognized striker for 70 min.. a day less rest.. and one of our defenders out taking a shit during the game. And we STILL had more ball possession in the second half. If this wasn't a Mourinho masterclass I don't know what is.
COYS
COYS
Reguillon has potential but need to be calmer in defence. Nice to see Spurs grinding a win #COYS
Shaky first half but dang did we bounce back! COYS!!
I'm so proud
Motm diers toilet 🚽
