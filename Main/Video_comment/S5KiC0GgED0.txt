This movie was quite disturbing
I must go punch that baby.. i just love how primal the moments are.. we indeed all sometimes had/have these moments of secret desire to do it and while not acting on it we so much would love to.. sometimes..
Guess how I was able to tell that this movie was written by a dude
This movie was hilarious!  It's for us older, single, adult males, with no wives or children. Not for women or the wholesome family type crowd. Never knew it existed till yesterday when I just clicked on it to see what it was about. Same with Maxxxine. 😂.
Pass. I prefer to watch either Transformers One or Superman.
This movie was gross. It’s just the Lead getting banged the whole movie.
GARBAGE MOVIE
Bella's power over Duncan was so immense that it shattered his sanity, a fascinating downfall to witness. I love that. Magnificent movie!!  🎥
the Perfect word for this movie is: ✨FASCINATING✨. the cast. THE CAST. wow from the people whe know and love to actors that are not popular and we're amazing!!!. as a just a little 15 yo girl who loves the cinematic world EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT.  love that the scenes we're we see from the prospective of everyone was in black and white, and for Bella prospection in beautiful joyfull, childish colours. the soundtrack pure magic🔥🔥🔥 the camera shots in different weird way, the cinematic old look and more... was really really of a high level. (and I'm not ever this kind so I really appreciate it.)  the storyline really good!!! the first hour and half PURE EXCITEMENT. you cannot move your eyes from the screen cause was so engaging! later last part was more off that the start but always whit this feeling. the 2 part is where Bella discover what actually life is and first of all life being a woman, then feelings so so much to exprime. and that was Okey. that was REAL.  and of course the actors, THE ACTING. wow WOW WOW. everyone and I'm really saying EVERYONE was good and perfect for their character. now I'm gonna talk more about Bella cause of course she's te main actress... but really I loved so much everyone in this movie.  Bella, a pregnant married woman that kills her self for the way she was living whit her crazy husband and she just cannot live it anymore. then "God" (a different surgeon) found her, and so he put Bella's baby brain into BELLA'S BRAIN. Bella now is a grown woman whit a childish brain. she has to learn so much leaving whit the man that save her, God. but then she leaves, and discover world but first of all HER SELF. and all of this journey was so beautiful. she understands feminist and know that she absolutely is one. and at the end (of course so much more happened whit the guys, her ex husband and bla bla bla) at the and she's finally free. for now. she understood the awful world that is out there and she's living whit it while growing up her self whit her journey called life.  really love all of this actors but a special I LOVE YOU EMMA STONE.❤️❤️❤️ wow. favorites red head. (like me too😭🤩❤️)  I repeat I'm only 15 and I have too so much more to learn, just like Bella. this weird movie did really fascinated me. so happy my mum just said: wanna watch this movie? yes. I had seen how famous and OSCARS WINNER has, but never really watched cause the plot is just weird and so I never had that "I wanna try to watch it". but finally on a random Friday I can say that: yes. this movie is WEIRD.✨✨✨  ~final Sabry vote: 9.40 out of 10!⭐

Isnt it crazy that a movie set in the 19th century is talking about socialism. And some 50 years later the have Gulags and Concentration camps from socialists countries. These people who know too much will all end up in these kind of places. In their beloved socialism.

This movie has great set design, awesome cinematography, great acting, it's well directed etc. but it's also a weird and pretentious piece of garbage lol.
The worst movie ever
I think Billie eilish would have been a better pick for the role.
I don't think that you can successfully label a genre to this film. It's freaking diverse! A masterpiece indeed. All heavyweight actors doing their best work. Stunning! *30 June 2024*
awful movie 0/10
It’s AWESOME in SO MANY more ways than people will ever understand stand it… more ways so than the people who created it…
What a totally amazing film
Would have had a much better ending if she would have put God's brain into Alfie's head, instead of putting the goats brain into Alfie.  Why else save Alfies body? He would still seem "crazy" either way, so Bella could keep her mansion... Plus God's laboratory.  Would have been a much better ending.....
oke
This is the most predator movie thats ever come out of predatory hollyweird.
More like “Poor Taste.”
Meh! I’d watch it if it happened to be playing but I doubt I’ll be seeking it.
Amazing.
For me personally, I was bored from the first few seconds of watching the video. It doesn't matter that the director of the film comes from my country. It's this American mentality that offers shows that Americans know they like. In the film they play actors who, apart from the leading lady, for the Greek viewers, are completely indifferent and we simply do not pay attention to them. The setting and atmosphere of the film seems to borrow elements from other fairy tales and stories. The awards are intended only for the enjoyment of the American public and have no significance for viewers from other states. That's all. Thanks.
why i am watch this like black and white color?
This trailer creeps me out i don't like it
Fantastik ve sürükleyici insanın aklını başından alacak bi maceraya hazir olun
TERRIBLE AND DISGUSTING 🤢🤢🤢🤢 this sickness is pushed out and it is a disease
I was expecting a thriller about Frankenstein's girl, but here she was stuffing apples into her dumpling & beeng pounded from behind for 2 hours😂😂😂 A very funny film, but towards the end it started to get feminist out of nowhere, therefore minus 3 Stars 7/10.
Bella discover happy when I want!
So a bad movie , 🎬 Disgusting meanings betwwen lines . Support all weird stuff in this world
The text looks like it belongs on a Rae Dunn mug.
I liked it very much, 👍
This is a weird EXTREMELY explicit movie, that quite frankly left me feeling disgusted.
The Swifties are coming
This movie is a pedofil movie its horrible
Bioshock infinite
The only poor things are the ones that paid to watch this movie.
Just see super bad
best film ive seen in ages. loved it. i have heard lily gladstone’s performance was also great but havinf only seen this film of the two, i feel emma’s oscar win was fully deserved. one of the best acting performances i have ever, ever seen
Güzel etkileyici süperdi film izlemenizi tavsiye ederim
Some really garbage movies get nominated lol
Interesting
The truth about how womens psychology works
Epstien approved
P*dos love this movie. Epstien approved. No wonder Hollywood is obsessed
Beautiful coustumes… I confess I watched the movie for the outstanding outfits… beautiful picture and colors too… when it wasn’t black & white😅… but I have to say… that sometimes it was uncomfortable to watch. Too much about the animals in wrong heads… and too much $3X .
Trash as$ movie
Dear god, emma stone didn't aged so well... 😮‍💨
Emma's super, Willem's great as usual. I like this film.
Bu filmi izlerken heyecanlandım, çok ilginç görünüyor
Harika bir film adeta başyapıt
Lisa Frankenstein is > Poor Things
About a small child's brain transfered into the body of a older adult. People think it's okay for a small child to engage on such horrific things. Her mind isn't a adult mind and people are laughing and clapping.
Великолепная актриса и великолепная игра
This is art hope it was shown on Netflix.
Shutter Island 2
It can't be that Gwen cheated on Peter Parker with Hulk
This movie is a guide for 304's...😅
“I must go punch that baby”
To describe this film in shortcut: "The Rule63 of Frankenstein".
I don't know if I like this film or not. On one hand I enjoyed the eccentric world building, sets, and Emma, Willem Dafoe, and Mark's acting. On the other, I am disturbed and weirded out by her actions knowing that she has the brain of a child. It's really gross.
One word: repugnant
I heard he had an affair with her during this from a source on set
One of the worst films I have ever seen. Horrible !!
This was the most bizarre disturbing horrible film I stopped watching after 20 mins
I came to realize that any movie featured in the Oscars must stay away from it.
I love the movie!!!!
Cok guzel bir yapım, heyecanlı ve surukleyıcı
Am I the only one that doesn’t want to want this movie from seeing the trailer?? This makes the movie look like the most obnoxious, ridiculous, bizarre, trying to be “artistic” and “goofy”, thing I have ever seen…
The trailer sucks! Whoever put it together or agency needs to get fired.
Why does Hollywood continue to cast women often decades younger than their male romantic counterparts. Of course it happens organically in real life, but in Hollywood does it purposefully Which seems ironic given they ate the same ones people who want to endlessly lecture the rest of us about women/ageism.
would watch but i cant stand Mark Rufalo
Mükemmel her an şaşırtıyor oyunculuk mükemmel oyuncular efsane zaten
Sürükleyici ve eğlenceli, izlenmesi gerekiyor
Sürükleyici ve eğlenceli bir film, izlenmek gerek.
Felicity was my favourite.
The Best movie ever
Worst movie I’ve ever watched in my life.
THIS IS NOT A GOOD MOVIE…..if you must watch make sure there are no kids around or anyone who respects you
In 1986, there was Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Seth Brundle in David Cronenbergs The Fly.  In 2024, there is Willem Dafoe as the doctor in this!
I think this could be a start of a slow rise, for unknown good movies, to get discovered.  Not only artistic films, but simply good, unkown stars in the never-ending movie universe.
Izlemeye değer bir film bence
Spoiler: i wish the General´s brain was implanted in a goat and God´s brain in the General. would´ve been a better ending!
This look brazyyy😂😂😂
I'm sorry but who in the right mind is interested in watching a movie about a baby's mind going into a grown woman and then prostituting........?????.
The plot of this movie is gross idk why people would like it
This was a bad movie. I was thoroughly disappointed.
Just watched this movie, haha it's weird and surprisingly nice!
I watched this movie and found it very demented, distasteful, disturbing, and just cringe.
It's like watching Serbian movie
What’s the name of soundtrack 0:36 starting from here? Could not find it
it was amazing scenes for my pleasures
Emma Stone. One of the most overrated actresses of her time, it’s giving Jlaw and Harvey Weinstein
I honestly need therapy after watching this movie 😢 It was truly disturbing  😐
Eh movie. I dont see the big deal. Although I enjoyed Wilem Dafoes performance
Devil doesn't even hide anymore
wait what thats Willem Dafoe!! Holy cow, they did a heck of a makeup job.
This movie was NOT good and deeply disturbing. It hides under the guise of a being a Frankenstein-esque type of remake, but the woman, played by Emma Stone, behaves more like a child. Like an actual little girl and have her engaging in hard-core...... Scenes. Hollywood is so messed up.
Vaxtınızı belə mənasız filmlərə sərf etmiyin

This is garbage nonsense... but they won an Oscar...
Green goblin , hulk, and  spidergwen
Mark Ruffalo? No thank you.
Joke of the day = This movie is rated 8/10 on imdb
Overrated af imo
Wack
Frankenstein for feminist.
The movie "Poor Things" made me a poor thing for watching it. Hollywood out did their Pedoness with this movie.  :( :( :(
I watched this. Emma stone is hammy and I will never like her acting. Defoe is pretentious. Mark was okay. The movie was pretentious avant garde dribble.
This movie was horrible. Atrocious.
0:25 I believe that's the reason poor things got nominated in the first place
I don’t care for this movie. I’m surprised activists have not boycotted this movie. I find it offensive the scene in this movie portrays an older man taking advantage and sleeping with a female that mentally challenged.  I do not see how this movie won any Oscars.
I'm sorry it was a pain to watch this movie till the end. They tried hard to make it shocking for the sake of it, but it just turned out to be some kind of cacaphony claiming to be about feminism when it gave the most horrifying depiction you could give of a woman and her place in society.
i did't see it yet.  what's the controversy ?
Got to see it on Hulu. I'm glad I watched it. Won't see it a second time. What scenery!
when degenerate perverts try to make an intellectual movie, you get filth
MASTERPIECE!
Trippy movie. Very entertaining. Strange things lol.
Looks terrible
Movie is weird. Too many uncomfortable scenes.
It's a cross between first 2 Frankenstein films, with a touch of Tim Burton. The idea of daughters brain in mothers was ingenious. Go back to the original where Fritz stole a normal brain, dropped it because he got spooked by a skeleton then grabbed an ABNORMAL brain that went into Karloffs skull. Rest is history. Now the ghost of Frankenstein, we were going to see Dr Ketterings brain go into the monster but Igor talked Dr Bomar out of it. You knew what happened then. I can now see why Emma is now a 2 time Oscar winner. Well done!!!!!!!
0:40 I get Plastic Beach vibes from this. This reminds me a lot of Cover
Looks awful
Liberal Hollywood’s latest addition to their Grooming America series 😂😂😂
This film is truly brilliant. Emma’s talent is incredible.  10s 10s 10s  across the board.
Is the movie  going to be on theaters ?
Tf, bruv?
Good movie, love the book. But it should have been changed to poor eyes, for since it's Emma Stone smashing the whole film lol.
Hated it! One of the worst movies ever. I can't even finish it. I don't understand how it was even nominated for an Oscar.
Like the comment if you are watching this after OSCAR 😂😂
can't wait to see this!
Looks like a lot of the people in the comments haven't seen Dogtooth...
Very very bad. Sounds so predictable and boring. I stop going Hollywood movies very long time ago. They all make no sense for me anymore. I wouldn’t spend a dime for any Hollywood movie after all. So boring and predictable.
This movie will creep you out.On the upside,  you do get to see all of Emma Stone 😊
Lily Gladstone should have won.
Embarrassing
It’s an awful film
may have been the worst trailer i have watched
Masterpiece
i love this movie!!!!!
This movie was crazy
Looks awful
I love Emma stone and Willem Dafoe but this movie was awful
It was awful.
I liked this movie. Only weird thing about it is that she had such a young brain in her head and she was a total nymphomaniac 😅
The dance part is the funniest thing I've seen in awhile 👍👍
How can I watch this in England
No, im here for something else
Is this film intended to normalise pedophila?
I wish we lived in a world where movies with imaginative stories, range of acting, and brilliant set/costume designs won best movie instead of those that just spend the most money on an ensemble cast, and a script ripped from the history books.
This is literally if I had no filter
Bleh
Mark ruffelo, my hero.
it took me two drinks to get through this. 🍹
Here after the Oscars 😅
Bellas over here bagging 2 guys and getting marriage proposals while she had the mind of a 3 year old, and I cant even get a date lol
"I must go punch that baby" I can relate
This movie is full of itself and over rated.  Also forced diversity.
Just watched it, it is not good.
Nope
This is the Bride of Frankenstein, but written by Jeffrey Epstein
This trailer makes me feel ill. Def not a world I’d like to step into. Whoa
Who is here for the Oscars and stopped the trailer halfway through? 😂 like here 👇
I'm sorry but it looks like doodoo
You hollywood people are getting more useless by the minute.
I am here to see, why Emma has bhaand voice during Oscar 😅😂😂😂😂
Just finished the movie. Absolutely bloody brilliant cinematic masterpiece.
Can't believe Billie Eilish got snubbed of an Oscar, she was amazing in this
Super movie
This trailer LIES
Rubbish
Poor things is an incredible film. Emma Stone rightfully deserved her Oscar win for her amazing performance.
Ist Poor Things überhaupt schon released? Läuft in keinem Kino in meiner Nähe.
Yes
I watched this movie a few days before the Oscars... I LOVED IT!  Within the first couple of minutes I knew it was going to be a great movie.  It is nice to see a non typical big budget movie being nominated for lots of awards.  I have not seen all the movies that were nominated for best picture YET, but I suspect none will be quite the cinematic experience this movie was for me.
Looks like gaudy trash, sorry!
Worth an Oscar?  really???
Absolute garbage
💗
Why bloody youtube doesn't show these trailers in recommendation? I'm glad I came here through Oscar news
What's it about??
We are here to check this movie after Emma stone won the Oscars right?
👇 The team! Who searched this movie on YouTube?
This movie exclusivity thing is getting out of hand, and I won’t buy into it.
THIS tripe cost Lily Gladstone her Oscar?
What a gloriously brilliant disaster!
A completely off the wall but fantastic film, the acting is eccentricly fantastic and Emma Stone is just outstanding.
Such a huge amount spent on production with such a juvenile theme and overacting.
Who's here after the Oscar?
Emma stone is so beautiful
Mark Rufallo is so cute
After Oscar’s button
Now I understand why  she said "thanks to my husband" GUILT. In the movie she was degraded sexually! Husband tolerate that! Bur yeah! Is the new "empowerment" she got and Oscar!😅
I came from a comment saying it was one of the weirdest films they had seen
I'm here to understand why Emma has won a lot of awards for this movie.... genuinely (cause I haven't watched it yet) and so are you 🙂🙂🙂🙂.  I got my answer now... thank you
Who's here because of Oscar's? 🤚
so she won from a movie nobody ever heard of eh. Comes out 3 days before the Oscars? Don't they have an insane deadline?
👇 Here after the Oscar’s button
I was not sure what to expect until watching more of this movie yesterday. It’s hilariously brilliant, and glad I didn’t turn it off.
Congratulations, Emma.
I guess congrats to the delectable Ms. Stone for her Oscar win tonight are in order! As a parent, I found her reference of her 3 yrs old to be absolutely smashing! BRAVO!
Bella = life force, Anima Mundi, Isis, Qi, the Great Spirit, Holy Fire, Diana, Kundalini, Kali, Mary Magdalene, Sophia
Interesting trailer! 🎉
Amo a los actores, pero en serio esto ganó más que La Sociedad De La Nieve???
I need an opinion before I spend my hard earned money on this movie. I need to know if this movie is a woke disaster with clear rich Leftist eltist and Marxist propaganda being pushed as Hollywood has notoriously been subjecting us to.  Is this one of those movies, or is this a politically neutral movie without any political agagenda's being shoved down our throats?   Please let me know.   Thank you. .
Just won the Oscar for sets, a fake movie. Against some real ones! Lol
Movies and be good creepy or bad creepy. This is in the seriously bad creepy bracket. Don't waste your time or money..
Saw it yesterday and LOVED the realistic absurdity of it all.❤
Amazing actors, but i did not like the movie !!!
Better this than Snow white lol
I paid premium $ for my 16:9 UHD TV to be able to see movies as close as possible to native aspect, without wasting screen size for black bars. Now you decide to shoot in 1.66:1!?! Are we going back to 4:3??? This might be blumin' masterpiece, I refuse to watch it. Stick to friggin' standards, don't try to be that clever, it took as at least 20 years to get to 16:9
Boring movie
Paris made me laugh out loud,,a rare thing 🌹
Edward Scissorhands mixed with Frankensteins monster.
Another disgusting failed attempt to sell us woke ideology through the 7th art.
I fell asleep
...another one, ...it is pathetic, how the mainstream topics lead to on vogue movie critics. It is very, very good acting indeed, the the implementation of the rumored theme is superficial and predictable, the illustrations of the scenes are well-known...not more. ...but there is obviously still an audience for this kind of entertainment.
It's a whimsically modern day update of Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" combined with elements of Pygmalion. Kudos to all the cast and crew. Emma Stone should be lauded for taking risks in her career.
It just simply movie about Lorde
I watched it on Hulu it was soo good
Why do I think Aubrey Plaza was considered for Bella.
Amazing!!!
Has nothing new to say. Boring and pretentious despite all the effort.
Everything was 10/10
These paid fake comments are too much😅
Frankenhooker meets Edward Scissor Hands
Botville here alright. Another film designed to push society in the direction "they" want. This is twisted.
Great! I can watch it again❤
I'm glad I just finally watched it in theater.I had to slightly warm up to the horror part with the dead bodies, but the plot twist was indeed interesting and worth my returning to see a film .
Of course Banner is the Doctor that creates the monster.
Strange film, which i think what its supposed to be... Strange not in a good way.
Oscars Best Picture, Best Actress and Best Costume design. You heard it here first.
Starts off interesting..then gradually degrades into a purely disappointing piece of classless trash. Walked out and can't believe I actually stayed as long as I did. Wait for the streaming and not waste your time .
I want to watch it.
A masterpiece
I’m watching it now thank you Hulu 10 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
This movie was garbage
It looks awful 💀
What an insane experience it was in theaters. Crazy and twisted all the way through.
The trailers at least have the decency to know how to present this movie — *WEIRD*      And no, I haven’t seen it myself.  Yet.
Good to see nudity back in movies.
10/10 for me. The whole cast were amazing but Emma Stone was absolutely phenomenal. I had to look up how to spell that, thats how good she is
Just Brilliant. 🖤🔥🤘
The nudity in this film was…yeah…
Mark Ruffalo is so funny in this !!!
One of the worst movies ever. I don't understand the hype. It's debauchery over substance. There are no redeeming qualities whatsoever.
Are all this comments coming from an AI bot?? This movie is literally 🗑seeing Emma Stone getting rail more then that girl cop by some bunch of white old dudes will get you hollywood awards..
Weird for the sake of weird
"I must go punch this baby" 😅😅😅 So me 😂😂😂
This movie is masterpiece but wow is it a trip! 😭
A Masterpiece.
another movie of Ruffalo's terrible English accent.
Fake comments is crazy
Watching it now, so far it's all in black and White...😂😂 no thank you got bored of it....... and it'd not the good kind of B&W... it's slow and not engaging as some other B&W films
I was not prepared for all the 4cking in this movie. It's literally half of the movie.
Willem Dafoe is being robbed of the supporting awards.
IDK if I could get into this, Oscar’s and all🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
Thank you Hulu I’ll finally get to see this
I'm super pumped to watch this.  There wasn't a theater around me that showed it.
I LOVED this film.
Wow ❤awesome ♥️ 👌🏻
The miracle club is a scary movie from Hulu.
Saw it in cinema. So so good
Emma Stone goes all out in this movie if you know what I mean.  And honestly more power to her!
I can't wait until March 7th.❤
I don't want Emma to win at the Oscars
i love Emma Stone,she is adorable actress ever in world
It was great in cinema ✨
Again
Yes!!! I can finally watch it! Close to my birthday too.
BEST BIRTHDAY GIFT EVER! Thanks Hulu
