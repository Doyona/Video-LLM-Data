... not me customizing dragons longer than I actually spent sculpting the dragon on this build 🙃  check out the game here: https://play.ageofwonders.com/Nerdforge ✨
After watching this video again, I noticed how much I missed seeing the Cyborg glove again.
Saw this on MSN's start page of stolen content and figured I'd at least come to the original video and give you a good ol algorithm click and comment.
A piece of Art… A masterpiece 👏👏👏♥️
I want one
I🖤🖤🖤
Can you design something for a Lenovo SFF case.? M working on something similar to what you made here, but m bad at coming up with idea designs Ps: Your Talent is incredible.
Wow! What an AMAZING PC!! What do u think about a PC, that is build INSIDE a Table or something?
You inspire me, incredible mod <3333
:D
It’s sooo GOOOD!!
Your work is truly jaw dropping and just outright amazingly inspiring
Would surely love to see a ultra realistic rendition of castle grayskull 😂😂😂
i like how she was wearing her pinky early in the video heehe
You are one of the most talented people I have ever seen!
wow that came ut incredible I really love your work can't wait to see your next build
what foam do you use for this?
I've tried making dragons before. The key being "tried" lol. Much respect. Thanks for sharing
Jesus, you're so talented.
Freaking awesome
Holy moly well done!
4090 being used to display a screensaver. feels bad man.
my new favorite computer case. Very very cool.  Thank you for sharing. 🥃🥃
Shut up and take my money!
y did you make the lower mouth not match. I would have made it match but have blood running down the sides. other than that it ways perfect.
This......, This bring a smile to my face. I am totally in awe! The PC looks great too!
Wow another remarkable PC build. I love it!
this is exactly why i want my dream pc built by yall! omg yall are simply the best, most creative channel ive seen yet on youtube! been a big fan for quite some time. thank yall so much for all the amazing hard work yall put into the channel, your art work and the enthusiasm that goes into everything yall do! the vibe is most epic!
Nice job   But you can also add some smoke underneath the rock and by doing some holes in that background transparent sheet which will help the cpu fans to blow the smoke out. 🎉❤❤❤
a little fog machine to make it look like its mouth was smoking woulda been cool as hell too
The seductive music when taking the plastic off was HILARIOUS 😂
That was sooo dope i could watch this all day
You are amazing.
Birds are descended from the reptilian dinosaurs that inspired the dragon legends so it makes sense that your dragon looked like a bird at first!
The dragon, his claw and tail , lights all beautiful but, why the fans glowing behind the dragon. The initial idea as I seen it, the dragon comes of his den/ cave but, with the fans in back is like coming out of nuclear reactor. If you would cover the fans with an acrylic plate and painting it to lose the shape of the fans and let it be just a dim glow would be better IMHO. Or was a requirement from Corsair to show of the fans?
So good!
The way you start with easier stuff to stay motivated teaches me how to go about it
You are a wonder
Best PC build ever.
Do you find the pinky you made more of a hindrance than help. I notice you wearing it in the intro but it’s off for the rest of the vid. Do you find yourself just used to it not being there anymore ?
A.T.D. Amazing 🤘
Love it great work !
It's fun to see you using your "new finger" build to casually build other amazing projects :)
This is so insane! In such the right way!
Such as  like a real dragon  in pc wow ❤
i c thats how that fake window works... so it works only for the cam - or one person. which could also be achieved by a green screen. but if you get money for building stuff there might be other reasons to build in different ways :-)
There is an Islamic book behind her called the Qur’an. Did anyone notice?
I think you want to add some red light (dragon level). Because dragon not looking clearly for shadow. And i like your videos. Love from Bangladesh.
I think"leftover rocks from another project" is code for walking down the neighbor's driveway.
Your dragon is absolutely beautiful 🐉 🐲
Spectacular ... You are a beautiful and talented artist
Another amazing project. The dragon needs a small smoke machine, so it breathes smoke.
It were great to see all what you've done in all those years together, so mean your studio how it is related to the dragonwall and to you 3 in 1 room and so on....
I  luv ur ideas ur   amazing gal  really   the more I see the more im stunned haha  Getting ideas for my new pc  what would U do for SIMS   pc Case?  I accept suggestions ;) Thanks for sharing this masterpiece can you list the materials or something similar to get an Idea?
thats so insanely badass
nice idea
Not enough airintake😛 great details in the bir….errr dragon. Talanted people.
I have never in my life seen someone who is so amazingly artistic and makes some of the greatest things I have ever seen yet somehow is so unsure of her abilities... AMAZING WORK! You are a beast!
This would look really cool with blue instead of red for an ice dragon
Can i get files for this project i would love to replicate it for myself 😅❤
10:07 is the perfect pause lmao 😂
Bangladeshi keo acho
Just  incredible 🤯
10:01 it look like a crow
freaking awesome !
This is in incredible !!!!!!
Greetings Hey Martina ...   I got a cool idea you can do for your next video ! Please design the fully outfit for ciri from the witcher 3 wild hunt game ! you really got the same look ! with the hazel/green eye and white hair will look sick ! Hope you read my message. much love .
日本からです。。なぜドラゴンの目などが光るのですか？特殊な液体ですか？
That was amazing, incredible talent and final outcome. Kudos.
Great video all that work done by yourself , very motivated to see how much people can do if they just take the initiative , just discovered your channel and already in love with it.
Saw you from Linus Tech Tips but this is the first video of yours that I really wanted to see. It's amazing.  I wish i had that tallent
creative is next level sister incredible dargon
Why didn’t she just 3d print the dragon
Man, that dragon looks just about fit to launch itself at us. Excellent build.
That squeaky noise that a blade makes in my head against styrox foam, holy.....  And also, the dragon looks like a pike with attitude :D
BEAST PC
does she hold the E-tool in her hand as if it were a mic on purpose?
К чему столько болтовни, она считает нас тупыми? Обидно!
Martina wooooooow that dragon looks incredible, one day I hope to turn my PC case into something like this! Fun fact, I have the same case in my PC already lmao. One idea I had was to have the exhaust come out of the dragon's den to give it that extra layer of immersiveness.   🔥🐲
I think, it doesn't have enough air intake... Just kidding, looking pretty good!
im sorry for existing in the same universe as you
If you’re dragon was real, I’m sure  she would love this
i want one 😍😍
I NEVER watch sponsor ads...but i just loved this video so much that i have to watch everything....i'm AMAZED 😮❤
God sure blessed her with the ability to do anything and be great at it.
Wow so awesome 🔥. I think I need one at home 😌
She Is Awesome
seems age of wonders does what stardock tried with fallen enchantress 😄
that is, stunning
I just realized Martina's literally giving us the shovel talk when she holds the trowel like a mic.
Ok fine and all, let me see the cake management
that dragon is sick. I love it.
Seriously, you put every DIY channel in the world to shame! Datum 🔥💯 amazing work as always!
احب هدا
Wow that was Amazing! You're Beautiful & Very Talented!  Real Artist!!
🔥👍👍👍
Awesomeness 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤
WAIT won't the dragon and rocks BLOCK the air intake of the fans?
I LOVE DRAGONS I wish I could afford for her to make my huge case into a dragon
This is awesome! Beautiful sculpt 🎉
Du kan jo lage en til meg og😉
Beauty smart and creative
This was definitely next level. Your talent is incredible and your dragon is so badass! Amazing artwork my dear!👍🏼🤩🫡❤️
WOW!   That’s impressive! Looks great
at least for me it looked like a bird because the nose curving down not up but i the end it looked like a great dragon
She has a realy nice body ❤
very happy to see the lighting and cool design double as cooling! can never have enough cooling!
amazing lady
U should try resin printing
부드러울거 같아요

awesome i need one
nice pc
Sooooooooooo cool ! Suggestion : when the OS raises an error or a warning, smoke comes out of the nosetrills of the dragon and a flame goes out of the mouth, with a HUGE roar as notification sound 😄
Now I'm wondering if dragon saliva is fire-repellant, lol
Love How she used the finger she made
Holy shit…. I don’t know if I’ve ever subbed because of a set before but daaaaaaaamn! That place is gorgeous! Not that I don’t love yall……….. but daaaaaaaaaaaamn lol
Such an awsome talent! And just noticed with 9 fingers!
fand dich vor jahreen besser, jetzt biste mir zu viel am dummes zeug babbeln...
what is use of dragon head.
You are so freakin' talented!  It's a pleasure to watch your content.
I'm in awe of the talent you have.. I would've given the dragon a forked tongue tho.
Would have been cool if you included two small round LED screens for the eyes and motorized the mouth
When carving foam it's best if you keep your shop vac next to you
beautyfull girl with good skills
Your really good at this, no doubt ;)
So rad!
That case is hot i love it
OH Thanks  A LOT!!!  Now I think my PC looks like shit!  LOL  Seriously...WOW...just WOW.  You're an amazing artist and so fun to watch...keep up the amazing work.
You know the sculpture is good when seeing a drill go in the eye makes you forget it's just clay Queue the phonecall from MSI asking when you'll do one for the Dragon series laptops.
Since birds evolved FROM reptiles, the bird actually looks dragonlike. Means you're doing it right! :)
Every step blew my mind! When sculpting the dragon I thought as well it was looking a bit like a bird but maybe because of the missing theet. once seeing the final head result I was thinking "Hell yeah" its a dragon!
13:12 Love the puppy smiling like  "Yeeeees!"  Also fun irony of a dragon volcano aesthetic with 6 fans keeping it cool XD
Great job!! It looks amazing!!
You're my hero
This specific PC costs.. you can't afford it.
2:39 I feel like I’m intruding…😭
The pc is gonna be ice cold
Are you wearing a respirator with no filters or is it a central filter??
Collab with @NateGentile pls ! Master Custom PC Builder
@linustechtips should see this case, Well done , this is amazing !
Wow, love the case, cool.
You did an excellent job on the dragon head. The detail is awesome. I enjoy watching your creations.
Age of wonders is my favourite game since i had a computer! and this! omg! what a dream PC!
Incredible design, well done it looks amazing!
Wonderful design / idea and clean smooth execution, really wish all sponsors content be like this , our life would have so much creativity encouragement and solutions findings with beauty, I might be a annoying picker , but wished the bottom jaw was also black (to say more dragon than reptile )and nose tip was a bit wider ( so won’t look like a bird one), spray painted the ventilation wired cover black to not break the smoothness with the silver cover, heck you could even do it red and have colors beside it to glow more lava, and last (I’m soo sorry if this bothered you) either the head be bigger so no space sideways except the one have claw and head , or the other hand claw on the other side , and again I would never have imagined a beautiful design such as yours , and for sure wouldn’t have written all this knowing there 90% chance no one see it , if I didn’t really love what you’re doing and wish you the best and most successful career for you both , stay safe and always curious ;-)
I would love this women to be part of Collectors edition for some upcoming games to come. Elder Scrolls 6 would be freaking good!
That was amazing
The build is awesome, but i would add something more to it. Like a thin layer of cotton to the back glass, the rgb from fans would light it in red and it would look like the dragon is emerging from smoke(or mist). It would look stunning. Dont get me wrong, its beautiful. Its just one more detail.
Can I hire you to build me a case for my computer? the 2 cases ive seen are beyond amazing!
15:41 bro that monitor and that mouse space...there's even no mouse pad
Had an idea with the head mold , clear poxy paste or super glue then add RGB light that changes colors... clear crystals  and clear dragon head and clear lava... your finished case looks amazing
Amazing piece, Amazing Skill set.  This is just awesome to look at.
Just i say artist
You seriously have to be the most talented person on the planet. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Probably one of the best things I’ve seen in my life. Kudos! Next what would be awesome would be a stranger things themed one, with the head and hands in the same pose and with the tentacle/vine looking things, that would be incredible. Also, beast of a pc! Love it!
Those specs 🤤
Ngl I'm from Ltt channel and just like how the cyberpunk theme so ifking awesome came here to watch all the vids
you're so underrated for this!!
Hi Nerdforge, I have just got a Fractal Terra case, and hoping to turn it into a Pikachu (not a flat one, but a 3d one) However I am not sure how to start it? you able to make a video for that or help me with some tips?
youre so  FUKKN hot!!
6:51 this is the smoothest transition to and add I have ever seen
Wow, right there is an incredible tiny nerdy thing.
Every thing is perfect ❤❤
this is the coolest pc ive ever seen amazing job and im a big fan of dragons
Where can I get the LED filament? If I search for it I only find lighbulbs or chunky LED stripes
I am in complete awe at what you do I had to bring in family members to watch this video again. I have done a few minor things to cases but what you do is is beyond artistry.
As a Norwegian I love the Norwegian reference at the start
Awesome job!
My favorite is the dragon 🐉❤❤
I need this where can i buy one  😢
That transition to the ad was top notch. Kudos!! The dragon is freaking amazing.
👏👏👏
The dragon looking like a bird is a good thing, birds are in fact descendants from dinosaurs, more specific the raptors, T-Rex. And these cute critters stood model for dragons in the first place. When saw the case (love it), I thought 3D sculpt im Z-brush, then to a SOTA FDM or SLA printer. But mylady does it analog. Cool.
Such an epic PC! Honestly amazing work. But why oh why do you have that sub par monitor??? That 4090 needs to stretch it's legs!!
40$ is crazy 😮
Anyone else want to taste her nub?
It was incredible! 🔥🔥
AWESOME
I just wish it was on the same hand all the time
I love your show it fun to see what you do i see your glove is working for you still
love the glove 🙃 it looks so cyberpunky. saw the vid where you made it, its fun to see it back in action :P(havent seen vids ur 4 a while)
2:26, Lucky I was alone through this part by my mercy what a clip! lol
было бы круто если задний фон дракона сделать матовым и дымообразным) вата или еще что-то
Your work is outstanding ❤️❤️
but how do you guys manage to sort out heating issues ?
If perfection was a person.. you were it
bulma
the super sensual slow jam during the peel was not an accident lol
You are so amazingly talented!
Epic
First time seeing your video and now I'm an instant subscriber! Great editing from the video, music, and your funny too! PC is such a BEAST!
the LED filament you used was it a filament that you can run through a 3d printer or more like a rope?
Uma verdadeira obra de arte parabéns ❤
WOW! Amazing work. Very talented!
I had a idea of my pc can you please build it I paid you I want the pc to be star wars the Jedi and the enemy and all new graphics and new stuff so I can stream I want to now the price please let’s me now ….
Amazing work. Really enjoy your videos and art.
Can we buy custom cases made by you like this one ?
amazing!!
À bit curious why no clear varnish or laquer was used on the dragon to make it look more wet… and btw aren’t there any e-cigarettes with usb control to stick in the monsters mouth to make him vape on a macro key on the PC? Watch out for nicotine though - especially for dragons.
omg ıam in love (not with case)
GIVE ME DAT LASER PLS!  Greetings from Germany, love you bye.....
I fucking love that damn dragon!
All that talent with only nine fingers. With ten she would totally ASCEND DIVINITY
Why no wings tho
13:21 👀 I see you are a miniature painter as well
Nice 🤘
Girl you got it..your the best ever!! 👌
Cool
Easy mod, to make it into a Jurassic Velociraptor instead  😀
Such a pretty bird 😀
Do you take orders 😅
No me entere de nada :(
nice
Nice  I like it😊
So talented! The build looks incredible ❤
wish this could be more educational ... for example :how to make that lave....
Please i want to see a Cougar conquer2  case inspired By MORTAL KOMBAT
2:57 not saying "case closed" hurt my soul
your window is so fucking cool ngl
lol leftover rocks
That is a bad ass pc case, WOW
wow!
What case is that
You now you can make a 3d projection screen that is even more realistic and potentially cheaper. You can use multiple projectors video/static(for the cheap version) that shines on a Fresnel lens with a opaque screen. This way you can get a way more realistic image.
U are the most creative person I have ever seen. Creative in all the right ways. That dragon was a true piece of art. Sticking it out a bit more and covering the fans somehow would make it a lot more pleasing.  It's only my opinion tho. What a great job nonetheless
I think I might just make a channel. I just don't want to piss off the underground real pc users. We build our pc's different way way different. PC fans what are those? Oh you have rgbs in your pc and fans. Hey check this out for cooling. A 10$ box house fan at the side of the computer. No water cooler hell no fan on heat sink. What is hot? The 10$ box house fan was meant to cool a whole room. Video cards fans they don't even turn on half the time. Where's your pc? Under the desk as I enjoy the free cooling on my legs from the fan. Isn't it loud though? Sorry can't hear it. I spent the rest of the money on my build to literally piss off every house within 300ft of me on a real sound system. I never even turned it up pass 60% volume as it is just a bit too much. My grand kids wish I would die so one of them could take my setup from me. They lose their minds when I let them game on it. It's a fight when they get to my house to see who is going to play on it for a hour. Kids lose their mind especially in race sims as I have the whole setup. Pretty sure they all can drive any stick shifter car right now at age of 10 and younger.
go to second to last frame of 13:13 you'll thank me later. honestly best part of the whole video and it's like 2/3 frames long
I am a simple man....
an amazingly beautiful girl❤, and also a master in her field❤😅
Amazing! <3
There are no words in any language that can truly describe the awesomeness of that build! The details are breathtaking! The end result is something that belongs in history books for the future humans to see. Mona Lisa ain't got crap on this pc!
this is incredible
ingenting tingeling
hot nipple shirt
Very Impressive!
Now you can say "my PC is built different" literally!
If's about the art, not about computers!
I know you were probably fr harrassed about airflow on past builds lmao but honestly, no one can complain about this. I also think it's so funny when people gatekeep customizing pcs and judge modifications so much, but also vomit as much rgb as possible all over their pcs as if that doesn't heat it up too lol. Like just let people have fun things guys 😇 This is so killer on every level, it's genuinely functional, lots of airflow and I think separating the main design piece a bit from the rest of the pc with the extension was brilliant. No more rgb light and heat from that design than anything else you'd normally have in your pc. Seriously, I know you know you're a genius, but you're a GENIUS. This is beautiful, and I'd feel totally comfortable using it without fear of overheating (as long as I had a good spot to display it!)
If i could afford it I definitely want customization from you!! Love your art♥️🔥
That Build look f..... amazing!!!!! The only thing which would top all of this is, if steam would come out of the dragon noseholes lol :D
she took DIY to a whole another level!
It's just so me to end up watching you make random cool stuff at 5 in the morning. Looks like the computer ended up running a bit hot tho', there is literally lave poring out of it :P
Would be super cool (and challenging) to continue the theme into the case with its legs and tail!!! That thing looks incredible. The red RGB intake fans match it perfectly!
Seriously WHO ARE YOU?! You're so amazing at what you damnnnn! ❤
ironically with that 4090 in there this PC won't be..... dragon.
You are just an amazing lady. Your talent, vision, and creative skills are out of this world. I love all the ideas you bring to life.
Sick! Put an LCD screen behind the dragon's head and let a fiery animation play in there!
wooooooow!!!!!
You are the mother of dragons.
Ты супер спасибо за труды 😘😘👍👍
i was skeptical with the thorny branches as well.  i was like oh no... then you cut it all off.  im like OH YESSS 😩
This channel blows my mind. Although I think its easy to forget what a team, good budget, and sponsors for free stuff does to helping to make content. Much different to be a team of one or two vs this when you have a team to parse out every single aspect of a show. Great show and I am not trying to take away anything from the show as its hard to have a channel this awesom but just saying this is a bigger budget channel and I sometimes forget that Youtube isn't the same place as it once was.
You're looking very old lady.. almost 60+
You're looking very old lady.. almost 60+
i must say... i hate it lol. but if your happy and like it then nice :D i mean the job is well done and all :) plus i'm not the one using it. good vid.
cutie :)
You should check out Crafty Art, the sculpt of Jorungandr the World dragon was crazy.
Too wonderful!WOW!棒！
troy
TIL you can use a trowel as a microphone 9:52 Well birds ARE dinosaurs sooo...
Unique challenge: make a diorama combining the games Rome 2 and Rome 1 for a custom gaming pc  Also turn a pc into the following dioramas: Japanese, Frankish and Persian Castles from Age of Empires 2
This is actually so sick
You are  incredible and your build is just woooo.
friend from Greece!
My dream pc and pc case 😅hopefully one day 😊
حرفيا واو
This is so 🔥🔥🔥🔥
A thing of Beauty. Just love it
That is so cool!!! <33
What in the dumbledore room is that?
I have a video idea! This may be really difficult or expensive and I understand if that is the reason you don’t do this but here it is: make a tv completely out of clay; use normal clay for the outside and translucent clay for the glass and use the inside of an old tv to allow it to work! Please comment or something!
16:27  that RTX is fire!!!!
can you please do a one piece, ANIME  PC CASE,  @Nerdforge
Think this is my favourite build yet! So cool the final effect. Brilliant
I wish i could give you a million likes! that's amazing!!!!!!!
dont usually comment on vids much but this is actually sick and so well don
Dante setup 💀💀💀💀
Dragons are basically dinosaurs that breathe fire.  The last surviving direct descendants of dragons are ....... *birds*.  So, it's not shocking that a dragon without teeth looks like a bird.
How much would you sell something like this for? O.o
You have such a pretty voice 🥰
Phenomenal
she looks like my ex
i bought a normal gaming mouse with rpg lights and my family started laughing, i wonder what they will think when i bring such a thing lmao
9:39
Do you play warhammer?
well produced video, interesting content and hot chick with hair and outfit game on fire. that's a sub from me fam
image a frosty glass behind the dragon :3
you guys desperately need a new monitor to go with that GPU
bruh asus gave you a 4090 holy shit
AMAZING JOB!
Does anyone know the name of the song ? @Nerdforge
total missed opportunity to have the video end by zooming the camera inside the mouth of the dragon and adding a loud growl or some sort of dragon sound. would've been the most epic end to the video!!! Regardless though, this was absolutely amazing to watch you bring to life. your talent is endless!
if i had the money....i would buy that from you
Amazing ^⁠_⁠^😍🥰♥️
That was incredible😮. But i have  no idea how you place the deagon inside the cpu???
Marry me..
you are so sweet and you make amazing work continues ❤
I am someone who takes care a lot of my PC temps, keeping my 1080ti rog strix oc edition at max 56º C on intense usage while it goes on other peoples PCs to +- 80º C.  That being said, I wouldn't fucking care about it if I had this awesome dragon popping at it, would even put some roaring sounds on it
This is my first time on this channel - I just love your charisma and editing - all very cool!
I need this
im not looking ur pc i watching something else
amazing work
Awesome !!!
wow such a great work, 😍
hmm... So much air intake... but is it enoughhh? ....🤣😘😅
a hot looking pc is not so nice but a cold looking pc is very nice
That looks so bad mam
plss pause at 6:39 and try not to laugh
so sick, amazing job
uau que magnifico trabalho lindo pc magestoso quro um manda pra mim no brasil rs
msi would have probably been a more on theme brand
👍👍👌👌💕💕
Wow !  You are awesome !  So kool !

Wow i loved it !!❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
You are so amazing watching you from egypt ❤

God level🔥🔥🔥🔥
you shoulda made the actual pc really bad so it could really breathe fire whenever you use it
Ima be honest, not my type of PC. And I fucking love dragons.
so f*cking cool
hot air doesn't come out the front, from the dragon?
I dont know where must focus on your beauty or on the pc
❤
I need this pc 💗😢
💳
Really great work!
چقدر خوشگل شد
the dragon was pogging the whole time
КОГДА ВИДЕО НА РУССКОМ ❤❤❤
I will definitely do the same with my pc
wonder how your gonna clean the dust out from the inside
That is truly remarkable. The patience and dedication you have is awe inspiring. Soo inspirational in every video. What an awesome channel. Thanks for all that you share with us mere mortals 😂💓🥰
1:57 it looks like a microwave😅
awsome work
This is a Custom PC..... just bolting on parts, slapping some RBG on it that you buy from amazon is NOT custom.....
the music tho
OMG, aaamazing!!
hey I love you
This is absolutely incredible!. Love it. THank you for showing us .
😁😁😁 "The stars 🌌 have aligned." ❤ Yeah, PC Build! 😁
Awesome
thank you    you are amazing an fun
"I wish if someone make it to me so I put it in my room and play ▶️ skyrim with mods dragon 🐉 born". 😢❤
this thing  sell on markets people buy like crazy LOL
WOW, just WOW!!!!  Amazing work as always.
Your channel is quickly becoming one of my favorites!  I wish I could do the amazing things you can.  Much love from The States!
Awesome build, may i ask how thick the foam is that you use? And where do you get it, i can’t find anywhere that sells thick-ish foam :(
A repurposed vape would make it provide cool fog effects. 😂
U R Look Like Grandma
I like those eyes 🌚
Man, you should cosplay Jett from valorant, you are perfect for it!
o

cool build Thank you for sharing
OMG OMG OMG  😱😱😱
❤👌
Didnt notice till almost at the end she missing a pinky finger
I wish all the best for you ❤❤❤
(Like writing a letter) Dear…. The twilight sparkle transformation is mostly complete… ( jovial complement.)
The dragon head is awesome! The whole build is. Amazing.
Absolute masterpiece. Every video is pure talent and creativity.
Your sooo awesome!
Make a drags but the core of the computer have a little sword in it with a knight standing on front of it
Fantastic work!! By the way what is the music that plays during the "Landscape" part of this video? I'd love to find a recording of it.
My first thoughts:  "How powerful must that PC be if the heatsink requires it to literally breathe fire"
I am in awe.
this is a problem coz now i wanna get one of those !
Someone at 343i, Bethesda, Playstation, Xbox, etc. hire this woman.
Yeah! you got it :) Very nice
Where is your finger? Why do you have only nine of them? Like nine Nazgûl.
amazing job congrats
Wow this is stunning 🔥🔥🔥
2:26 techmoan: "yeah take it off" moment XD
Cool, It would have been an interesting idea to have the fans blow out to the front and have the air randomly move arround the light.
You are so freakin TALENTED!! I love how you never give up. You bring your visions to life - forging ahead even when your not 100%confident!
Another great build. Gotta question though. The teeth. Are they hardened first or left soft before you put them in?
Sister your not just building pc summoning demon too
such an amazing project :)
I love your vids I always love to watch them when I want to get something done
and here i was waiting for another thermal paste bukake and anti cancer bracelets
What is that Mirror looking thing, that's so awesome too
You: skjera bagera Me: Ingenting Tingeling.
Astonishing.
Is that polymer clay?
wow.
amazing !!!
I mostly like the cinematic view of your videos 💚
Nailed it!
it's super cool, but i do feel a  bit bad for the airflow of the pc
You ncan build my pc if you want...
This is probably the coolest PC I've ever seen. The dragon is just amazing, and your talent is awsome. Keep up the good work
Use 3D Prtiner
Wow!!!😮🎉❤
We have you on the big screen for this one. My grandson wants to say that our skinks have feathers on their feet to help them dig through the sand. My grand-daughter just told me that such a noble dragon would have whiskers to detect wind change. We live this video!!!
you're easily one of the greatest artists of this generation
Amazing. You are so talented.
Love from India 🥰💕💕💕
sanırım aşık oldum
Amaaaaazing!
You realize that PC cases are engineered for optimal performance right, and your just winging modifications with no benchmarking. Brilliant.
ur incredible keep doing what u do!!!!!
Wooooow 💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
A fun fact is she looks like Billie ellish
Looks Cool
One of the best builds along with the best sort of art I have seen. Super cool😍😍😍😍
Love it ❤
Sickest looking custom pc case i have ever seen, incredible job!
She really nailed it !
nice waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🥰🥰
this Channel is a solid reason to check out  youtube <3
God, it made me so happy when I saw you sculpt and put in the teeth. They look so perfect and random and mismatched and just amazing. I feel like it’s only too easy to make the teeth too repetitive and polished looking. Your design is just perfect!
13:12 that dog!
Bad fucking ass...talent for sure
OMG This is really amazing you are awesome artist. 😍
wat the dog doin
paisa ni h
Ehgads that lava is stunning - fabulous idea, I will unashamedly borrow it sometime just because it's so damn cool...
Amazing work
Billie Eilish builds PC in her spare time.

You are so incredibly talented!! This is awesome!!
it's beautiful I want it
I love your vid's :)
amazing! and you are very cool <3 ;)
Hmmm.... If 3D Printer 🤔
So sick! 👏🏼
Every time I see your results I wanna do the same. But I’m not as talented as you so I definitely should start with easier things xD
Let's just 3d print and laser cut everything that means art!!! It's good for YouTube dumb people!
Cheep XPS 🚽🧻😔
intake overkill! make top exhaust omg not even 2 min in the video and already im looking at a dead pc in a month.. the heat heeds to come out Sweetheart ugh
The lava is so damn cool
Apoxie sculpt is a beloved medium amongst the doll customisation community ^^

Tongue should be like snake tongue fix it
i love you. go risk!

That's one sexy pc!
o11 air mini?
Beautiful and creative. I am so impressed!

Without Linus and Alex it isn't fun 😢
Amezing ❤❤❤
This is just amazing! Super good job
Your videos Are so good ❤️ and so fun to Look at and you put so much  effort and love and money for this❤❤
That is the most EPIC build EVER!!! You are a genius!! Artistic Bravado!! LOVE IT!!
too cool!!!
awesome
Can you please make a colab with studson studios pls ❤
holy moly!
If I buy a fan of this CPU, my budget will reach -$50 . Why am I still watching this video?
One of the few game ads I actually like. I wanna play now
I've been watching your youtube videos lately. And what you done with your desktop is amazing I have a question for you though. What is the mask that you use when you put on the? Primal on the dragon. I really like the four facial mask. And I do a lot of priming with my 3D print items and other things. So having a mask like that would be really nice. And thanks again for all your hard work and bringing out amazing content. I enjoyed a lot. From Shawn
8:50 finnaly! Jon Börk music :D
She knows how to attract men 🗿    Yo guys i am talking about that cool PC 💀
Please help me
Please
Please help me i am your old subscriber please help me
One word....Genius !
talkative
I love ur designs keep it up never give up on your talent. Me my family watch u all the time ur an inspiration to all people.🎉
oh my God, do you sell this?
I miss the cats in the video...
Day 1 of asking to paint my profile pic😂
You should make a painting or case for the monitor to match the PC
Maaan, creative channels like this one makes me think, there is still hope in humanity. 🥰🥰🤩🤩🥰
Imagine nerdforge and north of the border doing a colab
i think something stuck in you vocal cords
Earned my like 🎉🎉🎉
Art at its best, love it.
When i grow up I wanna be as talented as you
Ficou legal, vc é muito criativa.
looks heavy like an msi pc löl
Hey!  What did you use for the details? the gray stuff?  What did you spray on top of the dragon head?  What did you use to make shapes in the silicone lava led?
That goddamned man, love that epic dragon cpu
You are incredibly talented 😳 Thank you for the inspiration. 🌹
You should make a custom desk that matches up with the lava flow from the pc case!
I just recently just got into pc building and built my pc and when im watching this im in awe at how talented and amazing u are good job!🎉
It's AMAZING and Greate work, too much efforts. I'm glad YouTube suggested your video  Well done👍👌
awesome, she is so talented
THIS PC CAN SUPPORT SUPER AI , I CAN FIT IN IT FOR SURE
you look like jett from valorant
Can you just give me the pc It is so good I can't believe in my eye 👀
The dragon is so great! Thanks for the video.
About the "something about it just screams bird", It's the jaw. With reptiles, the lower jaw is usually smaller than the top jaw. Birds tend to have similar jaw sizes. To make it more reptilian and more dragon like, make the bottom jaw fit inside the top jaw like how human teeth fit (slight overbite is perfect). That being said, I loved this build. I always love watching your channel and whenever work isn't too hectic, I like to watch your videos and live vicariously through you and your projects haha.
Dragon Dong?
How did you piano all of this? Alot of kinds of Arts
I want pc like this🥺
You look like Bean from Disenchantment in a positive sense
please make an setup that deserves this amazing pc!great work looks amazing
it probably looked like a bird because of the pointed mouth
The first person to have made me interested in a game they are being sponsored by. Great explanation + Awesome videos. It's such a shame that I found you this late. Subscribed :D
Owesome
you are so unbelievably talented omg
Why im getting billie eilish vibes.
Incredible, you are in another level, one of the coolest things i ever seen in YouTube
Nice
Well Done!
I NEEEEEEEEEEEEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

Bruh i want you as my elder sister. then i'll get to have worlds awesome PC's🔥
Targaeryon lol

She can fix me.
cute cat u got there ;)
You guys are so skilled it's not even funny. What a stunning project.
finally A2d needs to review😅😅 this....
From now, you are my favorite youtuber 🥹
Why do u look like a princess from the middle ages
i think this girl is crazy
Hello when ive saw this video's thumbnail I click this because that Dragon pc looks awesome im huge dragonfan I have golden small dragon statue on my pc. This video was so awesome you are beautiful and purple is my favourite color. 🐉💜
amazing. also if u were to play minecraft mods what mods would you play?
I wish I have that PC 😢
What foam do you use to sculpt? and where could i buy it?
Indians have smoke coming out of his mouth
Have you married your boyfriend yet my dear
this was absolutely amazing!!! You do the most amazing work I have ever seen on custom cases!!
Do ice and add glowing cristals with a ice dragon breathing out glowing water on a TV if you can 😈
Guapísimo el pc
Im done with rgb imma get one of these😂❤
Yes
The best case of the century 🔥🔥🔥OMG this is the best case in the entire world. You really worked hard and you deserve millions of Subscribers 🔥
This is one of the coolest pc I've seen. You could also take it a step further by creating a fog effect on the acrylic sheet behind the head to make the red seem foggy and the dragon is coming from a deep cave
It's soooo gooooood I love it 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
When she gets a baby 😂 its gonna be crazy because if he or she will do not any to the paints then you know what is going to happen
Один 200мм вентилятор на вдув тоже хорошо смотрелся бы, будто это пещера дракона
Friend: so where's your PC Me: we have to fight some dragons
The case is awesome no doubt about that, but somewhat impractical imho. Nice showcase for the game and her mad skills though.
Danmm that looks awesome❤❤
@a2d
Would love to see a solar punk pc and desk set-up
HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT FOR ONE??
You are a real artist
I don't watch her videos i watch her beautiful face! Wish i could marry her!
Love from Pakistan 💗
Amazing work  I can feel it took a long time  I wish u had more subs, which u deserve  Keep up the good work ❤❤❤
The finger is soo cool seeing you use it casually and how it works makes me want to lose my finger to do the same 😂😂
Another tiktok minded girl, who collect view by showing her cleavage 😂😂😂 Shame
the black computer,black background,low light in room. I see NOTHING.
you are also awesome and excellent and beautifu and gorgeous
add a smoke machine that puffs out smoke out of the dragon's nostrils. it'll be lit AF
That looks absolutely incredible!
my sis
thank u for your beauty to let as see it 🥲🤍
Definitely increased my interest in plying the game once I finish all the games I should probably finish
i am a huge fan of your work. and i wanted to ask have you, have you ever heard of the cartoon "pirates of dark waters" it's a 90`s cartoon that i loved when i was growing up. it would be amazing if you could consider making something using that as the theme.
not being rasist but you are soo white
Sam from sam and cat???????????
Nice thumbnail ever
no no no, this video is misguiding. you are not wearing thumbnail outfit. i am disappointed.
soooooooooooooo coooooooooooooooooooooooolll
made i want it looks epic
The perfect build for the inevitable movie about a demonic video game that actually turns gamers' comps into portals to Hell.  Might be a graphic novel in there somewhere, too.  I applaud your commitment to exceptional craftsmanship. Exemplary detail work here.   **Side Note:**  A 6' long full dragon build, that's animatronic/robotic, & that you could walk on a leash...  w/ this kind of detail...  you would OWN ComicCon.   C'mon now, you know you want to...   :)
I thought she would have added some light orange/red light substance coming out of the dragon's mouth, so that when the fan's come on, it looks like the dragon is breathing out fire.  But maybe that would have looked a bit too tacky?
I'm just wondering how u gonna clean dust after few months 😅
Master craftsmanship nailed it love it pure talented girl
@,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,This is Amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,@
So happy I found your channel!
top top top fire
its just wooooooooooooow gj really  <3
Beautiful girl  and energy together ❤️ New subscriber here !
That’s totally sick, I’m absolutely 💯 impressed. My students that are into making their own gaming PC’s would totally geek out.
JAY SHREE RAM   🚩🚩🚩🚩
really good
the "sexy" music as you were peeling off the plastic. 😂☠
I want this kinda woman in my life marry me🥺
Everything is perfect the pink tongue is not consistent at all
Nori was so gorgeous at the end there, give hime a cuddle and a treat from us!!.
Woow
so nice you did a relly good job
Why is she so cute 🥰
oh god you are amazing'❤❤❤❤❤
How does she get more talented with each new project?!?! I always have to pick my jaw up off the floor.
Can you upgrade my computer please ?
Why i’m feel horn when i see this 2:39
what does Skjera Bagera mean?
the cute dog smiling at 13:13 its amazing 😂
Next Level build
This is probably the coolest PC I've ever seen. The dragon is just amazing.
Am I the only one thinking that the final result music goes “Hansi Hansi Hansi?”
Slava Ukraini!!!
Слава Україні!!!
How about a challenge Martina? The same idea, although not subject. You've done a console and a computer how about a "Tamagochi" ? You will have to go small (and find a Tamagochi)..I'm serious
You talk too much
My 2 cent, the front acrylic would be better if it frosted..
When you bored of regular pc
an amazing job well done
VIDEO WILL BE EVERY DAY I HOPE EVERYONE KNOWS THE TRUTH
Oh, it's the snout,, it has to curve. 🤞
The dog popping in and smiling might be the cutest thing I’ve ever seen in my entire life
ASMR part starting at approx 2:25 🤣
You just keep getting better and better, talent off the chain!❤
Wow
wow ty
i would love to have a pc like this one  so awsome would be a dream come true you guys did and awsome job
ALL THE TEXTURE ON THE DRAGON HEAD WOW😭😭😭
You have a VOICE... but its different
Who came to see PC?
You Are Cute🥺 🖤✨

That is an absolut incredible sight. I reworked a lot of my case to fit my custom water cooling into it (or better into and on it? I needed to move some things outside and slightly make more space for some things like fans), but that! Breathtaking. I would love to do that on my own, but my skills far art are lets say it politely not really existing. As I still need to rebuild one part of the front of the PC that would be an amazing idea. But no I would never be able to do it. I would choose a golden dragon. 😉😂
I have a white case that I was thinking would be cool to have look like a storm trooper helmet. How much would you charge to get that done?
Wow... just wow. Amazing
I rewatched the 'so you can shut up about your air intake now' like 15 times and probably laughed way to hard as my first thought was air intake xD
Have no words to this Unique piece of art. Just amazing.
WOW 😍
I was definitely not concerned when it looked birdlike without the teeth! Birds and reptiles share a common ancestor so it's only natural that a half-scaled, toothless dragon might look like a bird. Glad you're loving the Apoxie Sculpt! I've tried a few brands that are similar but that one is by far my fave! It works great for tiny details too!
your so cool i love you
Oh my gosh, this is so EPIC! Gah, you're so talented. Thanks so much for sharing this with us. On a side note, I'd never noticed your pinky until your one episode where you told us about it and built your mechanical pinky thing. You're BRILLIANT! Gah, I so admire you. LOVE Nerdforge. Love you guys. Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!
7:12 your hand mike 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Amazing 😍
insane
I must say the thing you do its soo awsome keep up the good work !!
Can I get 700$ plz
😁
Please make a GTA inspired case, i think it's gonna become an icon and would probably make you a fortune if it goes on sale!!
Where did you get that purple onesie in the beginning? My girlfriend was asking😁
beautiful and skillful  what do you need more .......the dragon still look like bird
Wow!!!! really super ideas..
大姐太有才了🌑🕵️
So damn good! Age of Wonders 4 is an excellent game as well, this was an awesome video!
i know we can't really see that wall in the background but i really want you to customise the thingy that holds your tools and i would also love if you could customise the handle on your tools but i know it would limit the usability too much and i'm fine with the thingy that holds them (racks maybe? english is not my first language)
wow, absolutley love this build, combining 2 of my favorite  things.... Dragons & custom pc's. amazing work love the effect of the lava & dragon lighting..
Nice screwdriver ;-)
Omg the dragon looks incredible!
Have you designed a realistic mermaid tail Martina?
I wonder if you were offering it for sale, how much would it be ? ps: grate job. it looks perfect 🤩
Er du norsk
you're such a gem. watching you work always brightens up my day.
me thinking maybe i could do this and then you started with cutting the pc case 😭 looks good af tho
Im speechless you are soo talented en creative❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
saya suka detail yang anda buat….keren sekali kawan
why don't you use raspberry for background TV?
THAT just gave me some dope ideas for my future dreamy Slytherin Hogwarts inspired bedroom. Can't wait to saved finally up for that. :D
You never fail to amaze me with your creations
You know I wouldn’t be surprised if you started wearing elf ears, not to be rude if it sounds rude
90% are not. here for the PC
💜💜💜💜❤❤💋💋💝💘💗
Looks awesome. Great job
You never cease to amaze!
ngl most youtubers would have just 3d printed a dragon head, love the dedication and hard work that goes into these videos, keep up the good work, you make so many people happy with what you do <3
You guys have done it again! What a beautiful build! ❤️🧡❤️‍🔥😍🥹😭
Good afternoon, do you sell such PC cases?
Can you please tell me the bgm at the intro like for ex- 0:06
What is that music that starts at 1:05 ??
CONGRATULATIONS on your special announcement from San Francisco !!!  Happiness forever to you both !
You guy are amazing. Great job. 🔥♥️🔥♥️
I used to be satisfied with my stuff. Since watching this channel I am now disappointed that my stuff doesn’t look like much cooler stuff.
🐲Ohhhhhhh Hell Yeahhhhh 🔥
other level, this is the fucking other level
Honestly, that looks too good!
That window is an led screen.right?
You always amaze me but this is just truly incredible! Wow. The dragon sculpture and the level of detail on the scales and horns and everything is just next level. You are just so incredibly talented and I’m always just in awe. Thank you for always inspiring me with your phenomenal art and videos! 💜
okay but imagine if you will: something like this, but it's some kind of deep sea tentacle monster instead!
Your studio is so amazing <3
Nerdforge rocks it everytime with Builds!! Wicked!!
you're so insane, love your work and the way you  put  your videos together
I hate that everyone uses the concept of broken bricks on dragon scales. Dragon scales are still *scales.* Less like a broken tiles, more like a snake.
Well I have been playing this game since launch and to see a cooperation with my favourite channel (this) is wonderful. I love the dragon build but the black acrylic pieces are a bit bland, I would have added a spell tome, like the dragon was coming out from the book. Because tomes are very important on the game. Just my opinion.
Next pc,   Stranger things custom edition 😀
Respect for her hardworks ❤   Her energy level 📈 after every tasks
Nerds are so much hotter nowadays
I would pay you to make that for me
Nice work! This piece showcases your skills and creativity.
crazy
It really amazing and I think for your next project u should customize a chess set with your very own original characters. And make the chess set the centre of a like Kingdom where warriors Battle. The warriors will be the chess pieces and the battle ground will be the chess board
Good night, I loved the PC, how about making one in the Ice Dragon version.
You are a genius girl❤ wow now do a demon slayer pc
Can you make a Harry a Potter school
To be fair.. birds are dragons. They descended from dinosaurs and still believe they are the rulers of this earth. At least, the little 'tame' house raptors truly believe this. Your dragon looks soooo awesome! ALL you do looks sooo awesome (both of you) Every time you say that you are not sure you can do it, or you are overwhelmed... you make something 100x better than even we can hope for. And we KNOW it's going to be fudging amazing!
This is such a cool way to blend fantasy and technology together in one unique form.  Your creativity and talents never cease to amaze us!
Does anyone know who is the tattoo artist for her shoulder tattoo???🥰
Your hair looks really good in this video
The Dragon looks amazing, love the two tone head and jaw!👌🏻
I love your purple jumpsuit! Where did you get it?
You are cool. From Russia with love
you are crazy
I see how you threw in the ad all sneaky like 😂🥸😏
You know what I'm going to say right? You know its coming. I saw you using the Citadel paints and the dragon head...  When are you doing the heroic mini Smaug and Bilbo diorama? Seems only fitting after this amazing sculpt and build.
Just wow. When do you leave for Disney Studios?
paradox makes some of the best strategy games out there, you dont see much of their age of wonders online, mainly its all about stellaris.
Hi, I am wondering how you guys get your 3d prints to come out so smooth. Please let me know. My boyfriend and I love watching your videos you guys do amazing projects.
There's unfortunate news that this PC had flown away right after the video was taken. It was last seen in Guangxi province. If anyone knows the whereabouts of this PC contact Nerdforge
2:26 - 2:41 LOL! I see potential for NerdForgeASMR @NerdForge 😅😊😌
Hi I believe I have seen you at the airport
That is just beyond incredible!
just for the sake of curiosity, could you tell us how long it took to build it, approximately?
Beautiful
Hi Martina I’m Maayan, I love your videos ❤ can you please recover Percy Jackson books? Ps. you’re amazing I love you 😄
magnifique très beau j'adore ♥ ♥ merci pour nous partagé tes créations toujours aussi belle
The lights literally gave me an orgasm 👁️🤤👁️
that is just Awesome <3
I appreciate how proud she is of her own work when she's finished!  Working until you're satisfied with a project can be tough!
Beautiful PC!
hey little quesstien do you understand danish
Martina, why don’t you customize the clock, which shows us time you’ve spent on the projects?
looks like crystal isles on ark
You are crazy talented. That is beyond human. I was shocked ❤
You need connect heat sensors to dragon. When case very hot dragon will fire spray.
Awesome project.  Where do you get the led filament lights?  I don't see a like to supplies
Watching her do the detail, painting, and designing my mouth dropped this was awesome work well done if she did my PC tower I probably ask her to design mine as Optimus Prime trailer from 80s cartoons I think that be amazing
Lol was I was watching the outro and my father saw this and asked what's this, it took me a while to explain that it's a pc 😂
Die ultimative Höllenmaschine hab noch nie so einen so coolen PC gesehen. Tolles Madl , Liebe geht raus😅
Amazing work as always!!
The dragon was sucked into the mixer! 😱
One of the most talented artist I've ever seen
To summarize, you make the absolutely coolest projects, and you do it in the coolest set possible.
Beautiful job, Martina and Hanzi! This looks amazing! Always excited to see what you guys think up next.
You should make a cool fantasy clock
Would have been awesome to add a mini smoke emitter from the mouth
Your project of the drogan is awesome and AMAZING I love it  so much and the painting you did that is awesome I love your masterpiece and I also love the dragon too❤😊❤😊❤😊❤😊
Your work ethic and dedication make me worker harder and motivate me to do more. Thanks for being here for us!
I love you
This is unreal level of talent, wow!
Stunning piece of work, as always.  And could we please appreciate this beautiful purple worksuit that Martina wore at the beginning of the video? i looove it!
Daaaam !
Like pelo cachorro
🔥
Literally built different.
Tbh at one point the dragon looked like a character from Gargoyles
The dragon was just so stunning.
Your work is bad ass! I love watching your videos...
arrggg i love your videos and i would love if you dipped into more steampunk themed projects i think it would be so cool to see you tackle 🙏🏾🙏🏾
While you did the spikes at first, before it got painted, i had the feeling this could also be a really f*cking beautiful iced landscape. Just imagine this whole PC in white/blue and the lava and fire would be kinda purple (more magical). Just imagine! Really good job, it looks amazing!
That's absolutely amazing
Great job.  Only thing that would improve it is having the dragon able to move its jaw and head and roar
Do you consider trying to make a 6-fold Medieval book, so called Dos-a-dos😃?
I think you should make a new glove with the pinkie finger. You already have the cyberpunk themed one, maybe you could do a medieval fantasy one. Maybe the finger could be like wood being held together with elven magic or something.
Nice thumbnail Bobby the builder
huh a game no one has heard of, starting to sound like a sellout to me
I'm confused what's with the "Skjera Bagera?" at the start of the video?
Hear my favorite youtuber Best videos ever and I'm a witch Your own magic workshop
i feel so sad for your bank account
Since dragons are reptilian creatures, wouldn't they have a split tongue just like a snake or lizard?
Nope, it's still a bird. When creating a dragon, you always have to start from something in real-life. So you start with heads from reptiles, birds, horses, or humans. It all depends on how sentient your dragon will be. Now that you know my magic, i will have to turn you all into toads.
Kinda reminds me of stranger things portal, with the roots and and the red
So fantastic! I wish I have a talent like you! Sooo creative!!!🤩
Пожалуй подпишусь на этот магический канал. Прекрасная работа.
Just buy a sticker
Just amazing!!!!!!!
I wonder what a white dragon with black teeth would look like.  In other news, fantastic work as always.
Martina, you are an amazing artist and you really should have more faith in yourself because everything you do comes out amazing and just awesome! Keep up the good work Martina and Hansi!
I still think the clock needs an upgrade. Doesnt fit with the aesthetic anymore. But still absolutely love every single video
daaam this is nuts congratz on this amazing build
just curious what tablet she uses when she draws?? (in other nerdforge videos)...as its not in description
https://youtube.com/shorts/6mYkNfdx5gE?feature=share  😮
Painfully off topic but I wanna share what me and my father sometimes does in the morning on the weekends before my mother would wake up = we’ll catch up on your content and then we’ll just talk about how cool your stuff is. The conclusion of this comment is my father is very wholesome so goodbye ( idk what this comment is and idk if it even makes sense 😅)
Your SOOO DUMBBB the point of fans is to push air, that glass does no service!!!!
The best channel on YT
would be fun to see what a whale-gamer would be willing to pay for that if it was like auctioned for a month
Oque essa moça faz é um absurdo de bom, muito inteligente
Bruh 4090 for background...
when will the release of a new video, the creation of a new fantasy book?)))
You are my ultimate dream of what my girl should be! 😂😅
That´s so cute,sattesfying and nice
Hi i miss you i am just thinking about some thoughts and you come to my mind i think if you want to make Attack on Titan weapons that can work and not just cosplay🤭l know it's not your vibe but i am  just want to say it😅
WHOA!  Amazing work!
⭐E P I C 🔥 L I K E S ⭐
you are just perfect , 1st video i see , direct subscribed to your channel
How much?
That PC Monitor needs to go.
If you decide to do a 2.0 version animate the jaws on power up
Outstanding craftmanship
Martina starts working: This is where the magic begins!
First time watching your content and I'm enjoying it
A Masterpiece!!!
Love the dragon build!
Probably thought about going house scale, but if it is ever is true depends on passing this knowledge to any fast food. For diplomacy nobody is beginning with most powerful country and they will say they want to have jubilee again and Lan Party is more than bringing all the pc to one place. So I don't want to have anything hanging up high smaller.
Everything you create is so extremely amazing! Yet another superb result. The creativity you demonstrate is outstanding.
Amazing
Iam a big fan of your works and imagination. This also came really great. And I woud like to tell you that dont spoil your work in thumbnail.
That is epic
❤️❤️❤️❤️‍🔥
This video contains 120 percent of your daily requirement for epicness. The PC looks great, dragons just improve everything. They are, if I may say so, the MSG of fantasy. Fittingly, here is a big, strong and fluffy dragon hug for all of you.
Damn she is talented than ZBrush😮😮❤
Wow! This thing is simply so awesome! Your Dragon, looking like it would start to spit fire every sencond, is unnormally beautiful!!!
Hello! When I went to Melbourne - Australia recently I saw this *really* cool book/journal store with all these torn-up/old looking pages and *super* pretty and detailed designs that I think you would *love* ... well, I *did* forget the stores name (oops) I just thought I should let you know! PS: I love your channel and all your videos ❤🧡💛💚💙💜
Can you be in a youtube rewind for animation
You guys have one of the best editors on YouTube
This is really over the top!  Great job on the PC buildout!!  This is in my top 5 Nerdforge buildouts!!  Keep it up!
It had been bothering me for a while now trying to figure out why Jess Bush (Nurse Chapel) from Star Trek Strange New Worlds looked so familiar, realized it's because she looks like Martina. Is it just me or does anyone else see it?
I'm unsure whether she mentioned it. But if anyone is wondering, that's a Lian Li O11 Air Mini. It's an excellent case, especially for mATX builds with lots of 140 mm fans. I have a white O11 Air Mini, and I love it.
2 years later, she's gonna build a whole dragon (with PC inside).
Anyone know what that case model is?
I love your work and how you can make stuff out of super normal craft + diy supplies! You have so much talent :D  I wonder if you would ever do like online lessons we can purchase to guide us on creating our own things out of the same stuff? That would be so cool! We love you Martina and Hansi <3
So cool!! you are talented and loved watching this, ❤❤
That is sick.
Where are you from??
For dragon anatomy maybe try to look at the skulls of some reptiles, like crokodiles or snakes .  Your jaws are very rounded, which reminds  me alot of a ravens skull strukture, Reptiles often heave edges and a diamond shaped skull.  The end result is still absolutely stunning, so this is just some kind meant tip.
Wow that is absolutely amazing 👏👏👏👏
For the medieval clock project.
An amazing video again.  It is a great idea to add a clock in the view to show how much time has been passed.  Sadly, the modern clock sticks quite a bit out from the  beautiful medieval background. My suggestion is to make that your next project to make it fit in your decor.  I will pay 10 Euro to make it happen and hope others like this idea and add some money to this build as well.  Now i will wait and see what you make of it :D
You did an amazing job. Your creativity and passion always shines through. Absolutely adore it.
When I saw this project, I immediately thought about how this is gonna effect the air intake. I got around 2 minutes... well, that felt very personal. 😅
such inspiring work!
Omfg, I'm in awe! You have really outdone yourself this time, the dragon is stunning!😊
she painted that glue like bob ross
Hey yall should make like a hunger games diorama that would be such an epic video pls
I know its not the point of the video but I love the NerdeForge Overalls.
Awesome!
Am i stupid or is this the third Thumbnail in 5 days? Did you get the youtube middlefinger because "blablabla pg blablabla less booba pls bla"? Kind of looks like it
wow 😲😲😲, even cooler when it's dark 🥳🥳🥳
Just wow 😮. One Question please: where can i can this nice Mug ?
your electricity bill is going through the roof ToT
Sick!!!!!!
.
that's just.... next level cool!
no more tatoos pls,,
Nice drag- dog -on!
this is the COOLEST FUCKING THING i love your smaug tower <3
8:49 please PLEASE tell me this T shirt is or will be for sale. It’s awesome and I need it ❤❤❤
That is so cool I love your work keep it up
Nice screwdriver! I wonder where you got it 😅
why are you using a 4090 for a backgroud?? ITS THE THIRD BEST ON THE MARKET!
amazing
This is something that’s worth robbing and taking risk even better than robbing banks no cap
I'm still worried about the air supply, but damn this looks so sick!
Martina your talent has no boundaries!  Absolutely awesome what you have done with this PC case build. ❤❤...and Hansi too. 😊😊
Это очень круто!
I can watch you pull off plastic all day😅
I don't use PC much, but god if I did I'd want something awesome like this being a huge dragon fan as I am.
Awesome! but its missing 1 feature...a tail, which curls around the box but is actually full of usb hubs, plugs for mouse and keyboard etc
Truly amazing work. Awe Inspiring. 💙
WHY IS SHE SO AMAZING AT EVERYTHING!!! from drawing, to painting, to sculpting, to anything art... even electronic things.... so skillful!!!
I’ll watch her vid again when she decided to stop wearing stupid revealing clothes. I come for arts.
That was a cool project 👍  Bit late now, and you may already have thought of and dismissed it, but for years model trains and R/C modelers have been able to use simple smoke generators to give a 'realistic' exhaust smoke look. If you, or those reading this, do something else along these lines, you could plumb in a feed from one of the generators through to the nostrils - maybe with an on/off timer to give a 'breathing'affect?
Make a  feith (electric) dragon with his full body. The dragon  has to be from ELDEN RING !Do it please! Every one that has the same idea, like the coment
can any one give me tha music at 8:30
Fantastic work👍
Ok is it me or have there been 3 different thumbnails for the same vid? or am i getting (even more) crazy XD
With that 4090 in the dragon PC, let's hope it doesn't really breathe fire😂.  Bad graphics card joke aside.  Really awesome build.  Hoping you do another Collab with LTT.    Any chance of you doing something Witcher or FF XVI inspired?
id love to see you do Fenrir
In my opinion, I think the panel behind the dragon would have been a better if it was translucent isntead of clear so the the color and light shine through with it overtly looking like spinning fans behind the dragon.  Perhaps even a vignette along the edges to blend it.  But otherwise, it looks amazing.
Dios!! Quedó super genial, hacen cosas maravillosas los veo desde hace un año desde México son muy talentosos amo sus videos!!
Gosh dang how do I do this myself
Wow!
Freaking epic! Makes me wish I had the skill/patience to make something like that.
Amazing work!  WOOOW!!!!
So AWESOME
Bad ass
A fantastic modelled PC. I'm really into Dragons and am now looking at my PC and wondering what it would take (and how many attempts) to make mine a Dragon PC.
Wow! This is so freaking cool! I like to use different types of animals in combination when designing a dragon, scales, skeletal structure, musculature and wings (alligator, cat/lizard/horse, hose/cat and bat) and then a bit of wolf throne in to break the "bird look". I even add some praying mantis sometimes. It's all about creating a sense that sells the danger without it coming across as if the dragon were a vicious dumby.
Is bad that I don’t just watch her make things but listen to music
Amazing!👏
wow as always love you works keep them coming
awesome work young lady
OK so I need you and Rachel Maksy to make a collab somehow!! This would be EPIC!   And I ordered your print cannot wait to put it on my wall 😍😍
This is the casemod of the century! I had goosebumps the whole time amazing work!
That's straight up awesome! Such an epic project once again. Really enjoyed it. :)
The idea to make stones using aluminum and forbidden milk is genius!
I do miss having coffee with you before you create your Amazing Crafts. Such Incredible Mastery.
Girl this place where you worklooks godly
a very talented lady 🌹
Outstanding . . . simply outstanding!
wowww 🐉an amazing pc
Please please please make a underwater mermaid in resin 🙏🏾
Saying that you've the gift of art, it's not enough. Madam, you Rule! Your works are astonishing me for at least four years!
NICU
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
ummmmmmm I'm I suppose to feel this way about a plastic peel.
geile Idee...;-)....
Not art related, but I like the singularity instrumental in the background here in 2:28 hehehe but the case, i do like how it turned out😍😍😍
totally awesome
The dirty nails🤢 give a charm, a very special touch to the sexy moment at 02:34...
I saw your sculpture in the Outland in Oslo, I love it! Also I love the dragon here!
AMAZING I got imaginig smoke coming out from his nostrils, and something to difuse  the fan lights, as like he is coming out from the lava maybe Love you!!
You could of done a steampunk(like an old looking clock like pc)
+100 fps
That dragon is insanely awesome! Especially how the LEDs just make it pop like it's about to spray fire everywhere. You guys are inhumanly talented.
I love all of your stuff, but this one feels a bit incomplete when you look at it straight on, like the dragon head is hanging in front of the fans but there is no indicator of a body or possibly a whole dragon coming from the system... maybe a painting on the plexi that the head is attached to so that there is a bit of perspective? or possibly an infinity box type thing between the dragon and the fans? The case and the sculpts are 100% amazing, I also love the warm white and the way the lava came out! I'm a freak for RGB in builds (not PC as much though) and I think it came out great. Thank you for all the awesome builds and the art you put out for all of us youtubers to enjoy! You guys ROCK!!!
PC Dragon 🐲🐲🐲
Stop glueing stuff. That's going to be a pain for everyone
Insane <3
Impressive
"Baking clay is like a quicksave"  I love it!. Such an incredible dragon! It's been so great working with you.
I would turn of fan's LED Incredible build ❤❤
i wish i could meet a chick like this shes so cool
Wow, jost wow!
She speaks a lot 😂❤
Cool🥰
Scyrim.... FOOOOOOOOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Are you Norwegian? I noticed that a lot of your materials are sold from “Panduro”
I would love to see them create their version of excalibur ❤ with it stuck in the stone and all 😮
How ironic that she thinks we are awesome..... no girl, YOU are awesome.  🙂
does that apoxy putty air dry? all the ones Ive seen need to be oven cured.
are you from norway
That turned out amazing!
Seriously Amazing.
At 17:12, imagine the fans are "eyes" and the actual eyes are "nostrils"... gives a whole new monster, can not be unseen :D The dragon is very cool! Also i think the illumination of the fans in the background ruined it pretty much.
Nori is so cute here haha
imagine she added some sort of smoke machine type things in the dragons mouth... maybe some of it in the background as well. sees pure hellfire
Pride Dragon 😂😂😂
Awesome... One though... won't those fans make alot of sound noice for your studio recordings?
if you haven't done it already, I would be a very happy boy if you made some armor for your dog
🐉🐲🐉
Elder flame Vandal😄😄😄
I'm a pretty creative person. Compared to YOU I am in a perpetual coma! I would LOVE to know your childhood influences. For instance, maybe your Mom was an artist and your Dad a sculptor? You should have somebody interview you about YOU and post that! I can't wait to see what you do next. ❤
THAT IS SO COOL
With all those lights I always think „damn how are they paying their electricity bills?“ XD
This is awesome ❤
Omg that’s so amazing 😲👏👏
Yes.
How about making a fantasy inspired house, you make work of art in mini form, wearable shapes, even indoor decor, how about living space?  I'm thinking dragon castle/wizard tower? 😁
I know you said shut up about the air flow, but I really think intakes on the front, through that glass around the lava, and maybe even in the mouth and a couple places like that would of added with the vents on the side too and allowed for better air flow.   I think you did a lot better on your dragon design and liked the tongue and pieces through it. I have thought about playing around and altering one of my old cases to do some Klingon symbols and the like.
So, question. Do you only make fantasy, or are you open to trying other things? I have been wondering if you make an xenomorph nest.
YES!! I LOVE epoxy Sculpt too!! Good stuff!!  😄👍
That is so freaking awesome! Can we just appreciate how much time Marina and Hans take making these beautiful builds and also filming the procedures for us to watch?   It's so beautiful! You guys did an amazing job! Epic video as always!
Linus should be jealous
Dragons are my special interest, something I really really really love and seeing the final result literally made me emotional, it was so good that I cried a little! 😂
the purple fit, is crazy cool😍✅
Nori is so cute❤
I thought it was that dragon from The Hobbit, but that's ok :P
You have the most beautiful channel scenario EVER with this Hogwarts Library set 😍😍😍😍😍
Such a high level of skill in your work. GG
dragon deez nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuts
this was SOOO much fun to watch🤩🤩🤩
man i had to take a break and compose myself after that plastic peeling lmao
Wait WHAT??? I watched this for almost 18 minutes and Hansi..... DOES NOT GET TO SAY "ASTHETICS!!!"    with eyes rolling?   SHAME! *bell klinging*  SHAME! *bell klinging*
This is such an excellent build!! I never stop being amazed by the work that you and Hansi do. <3
So cool
Age Of Wonders II still my favourite, it felt like a true myth
Such an amazing piece, the details and texture on the dragon head ara absolutely amazing! I have to say that the fans behind the head kinda ruin it a bit, I feel a darker acrylic might've looked much better, only allowing a little bit of light to go through and maybe some more LEDs to hide the ugly circular fan shape.
That dragon sculpt is 🤤🤤🤤🤤
you sould totally decorate the clock at some point that would be so sick
10:10 Dont worry, dragons were created to explain ( in medieval times) the dinosaur bones. And birds come from dinosaur so I think is pretty normal. Check the cassowary, is a bird but it look like something from Jurassic Park
can I buy any of your projects from a online store
as my pc in my bed room it would be scary to wakeup at dark night with dragon in my room but realy great work as forever   love you from egypt
I love the live drawing/visualization of your plan while you were talking next to it in the video!
Work of art!
🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡
its just amazing . I fall in love with the dragons tongue. please make more challenging stuffs and be perfect like this for ever.😁😁
awesome mods!
I wish I had the time or money to use my talents like this, good on you for winning the game of life! You are fortunate!
Wow amazing thought u could not beat us last build but this just blows it away
13:12 oh my gosh so cuteeeee! 😂
I am relatively new to this channel, but I have seen a few videos and I have to say, I am blown away by the creativity here. I really love watching these videos, and I’ll add… when the wizards study room was completed, you had me hooked. Still, can’t wait to see what is to come from this channel. thank you for sharing your vision. :)
Your art is inspiring. I feel the urge to start something creative but then I realize that I suck at that and continue browsing other stuff on the web. Keep up the great work!
Masterpiece 👏
Love your enthusiasm, love of life, art and fantasy. You never cease to entertain and amaze, both of you❤
man , I wish I had only 2% of her creativity , love the custom case
This is the best computer I’ve ever seen
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Purple girl?
That is a good looking dragon.
not another female with blue patchy skin. keep blocking them but there's more and more...... go away please
I couldn't help seeing the 2 fans in the background as 2 big eyes with a screaming little dragon mouth 😂
I think my favourite part of this beside it is a Dragon and a PC! Is that bottom jaw who os a different color! We don't see enough of Dragons of 2 or more colors
on the nintendo you promest ist the last one and then you making a bigger one hahaha. but ist better i like this things...wat ever they colse
What an awesome build! I LOVE the sculpt and the LED lava, sooo good!  Apoxie Sculpt is amazing! I’ve used it a few times, and the only drawback so far is the smell while you mix it! I love the finish achieved with the dragon’s scales and the rocks, it’s so impressive.
That sensual plastic peel is the midweek boost we needed 🤣
you never fail to amaze me. Your pc/xboc/playstation builds are probably my favourites out of your videos. Having a custom pc like this would be the dream 😍
thats amazing!! great looking dragon too🥰
dammnnnn,  you've made the best ad transition ever to exist :D
DUDE this is INCREDIBLE
Amazing
With this sound maybe he is in the next marvel-movie....damn
BARDO TO JEST CIEKAWE
Props to Hansee for assembling the thing to a functioning state. I've seen many people mess a pc build. Amazing art I want a dragon on my pc too
❤💥
Omg it looks FANTASTIC (and I really love the horns details for some reason 😳) ❤ I also usually spend more time in the customizer than in game I see what you mean 😂  Important tip for when you use Apoxie Sculpt though : please wear a mask, people using it often without one ended up with pretty bad health issue on the long term - and we would all be super sad if it ever happened to you 🤕
What if you put cotton or a window screen to make if look like fog or mist behind the Dragon?"
i don't know if it was on purpose but giving it t-rex teeth really added to the look
I love the shirt!!! We need more NerdForge merch!!! :D
Pulls off the plastic wrap... Slower...do it...slower....oooh yeah
Ok an elder flame pc that's awsm
Love it!
Nori smiling was just utterly adorable!!! Perfect editing :)
Yooo that looks sooo epic
its so majestic!!!!!!!!!!! i love it
You're like that NPC which reforges weapons
OMG how did you do that!!! It looks AMAZING!!!
Am I the only one who saw the tub of Apoxiesculpt and immediately heard Crafsman in their head?…uh-POXy-sculp!
You, guys, are magicians
I love how nerd women have discovered they are flaming sexy badasses.
saw this suggested on another video but maybe a project customizing the timelapse clock to fit with the fantasy vibes? could make it like a steampunk dwarven looking clock with LEDs or something?
That is AMAZING! I love the detail on the dragon.
And again: An amazing work!<3
😍🥰
The romantic backsound and montage of the plastic peeling  😭
Cool ❤
Hey 😮 shit what is the price for the whole PC?? Built overall holy shit looking good match love from South Africa and a like and a SUB √ 100℅ big W
I gotta find a cheeky, talented lady like yourself. Well done
the 55hz monitor you're using with that pc hurts my brain so much
This is freaking incredible 🤯😍 You have outdone yourselves again.
See the little test peace alone could be its own little art peace, stuck it in a frame and that would look so cute🔥❤
Your level of experience imagination and creativity grows with every build
That dragon sculpt was the comeback of the century
It actually kinda looks like a skecksis from dark crystal lol. But seriously, your extremely talented.
Looks INCREDIBLE!  great job. I think the reason it looked birdish is it needed more lip material. Like longer area between the lip and the top. Like on a human where the mustache would be but all the way around the top side of the mouth. Right now it comes around from the top and cuts off. I would have liked to have seen it come down from the top of the front upper jaw and have some vertical length before the lip/end and teeth. That would make it less bird / beak like.
turned out to be a cat carrier, but for a dragon😂
Cool. ;)
Amazing build! Y'all never disappoint!
I love this pc❤
the outfit <3 <3 <3 <3
Whaaaaa..... That's a real Dragon !!! 😉 ( I hope, at least, that they give you a copy free of charge of the game, for all the marvelous work you made for them ). Excellent and brilliant work guys!
You guys are so inspiring! I love your channel and your content.
Absolutely epically awesome!
What if you guys made a cool fantasy clock for your videos instead of the normal clock.
That looks absolutely amazing! The level of detail on the end result genuinely made my jaw drop. Bravo! 😃👍
did she add something new to the perspective painting she made in a previous video?? the art hanging on the wall at 6:28 seems a little different 🧐🤔
so you are not building a new computer, you are putting decorations on an old computer... I've been building computers since 1984... I am soo disappoint
Fans are looking cool
Absolutely incredible. Never cease to amaze me with your builds. they are just incredible.
Sex?
It’s 1000 time better than those official figurine that company always sell 😍😍😍
Tu es incroyablement doué !!!! 😮
it is kindda strange that you do not use fimo for the details (while using it for the main shapes), whereas it is used for miniatures sculpting - and therefore usable for very very fine details (but it is the soft version of it, and the one you used is probably the harder one, or you are more used to the one you use in the video - given the result, you clearly master it !) Anyway, impressive work, it is beautiful ! And where do you get the led filament, it is such a good idea !?
This is just amazing as usual!!❤ Imagine a lord of the rings diorama with these lava lights, that would be epic!!!
Wow... just... AWESOME... the dragon is perfect... the scenary is absurd.... the lava with the led strips... so perfect... the integration with the case was genius... AND THE BEST PART IS... the case and the airflow are totally fine... we see so many ppl doing a good job about customizing a pc case, but end up with a furnace, eventually cooking all the components... this is form and function in a holly matrimony... again... wonderful job...
Damn just EPICCCcccccc
its my 1 st time wachting this chanel and it looks insane
Ахуенно🎉
😮 Wow. This is so cool.
This is so cool! I always love watching your amazing videos ❤️
It is absolutely amazing!
Too sexy, cut out at 3 minutes
Your monitor is dying ..
The Case looks Absolutely Fantastic, the making is really cool to watch but the background music is not that synched
Tell me that this is not "just" the window driving PC but also something Hansi uses to game and edit etx. It's got a 3 fan RTX card so surely ;)
2:56 Missed opportunity for "case closed"
That is the coolest case I've ever seen.
this looks crazy, and I LOVE IT!
i built a dragon pc and got my pinkie eaten
Cool
great result
Awesome build, gj team NF
Best thing ever!
.. just .. wow. You never fail to amaze!
Martina I have been watching you for years but this definitely has to be one of the COOLEST (small scale) projects you've ever done!
Can i just say that I adore your filming space! I love this project as I am a HUUUGE Sci-Fi/Fantasy nerd and love computers in all their magical shapes and sizes.
Now play the game with your speakers blaring Through The Fire And Flames by DragonForce😂
NOT THE SENSUAL MUSIC WHILE PEALING OFF THE PLASTIC WRAP SHSHSHSHSHSHSH 😂😂😂😭😭😭
@linustechtips
I finally googled "Skjera Bagera" and the very first search result was your patreon, which is cool but doesn't help me translate it.  But i gathered it's a greeting like "What's Up" in english, right?
this turned out awesome! but those eyes man, hideous.
You should customize your clock!
where is linustechtips comment?
Mind Blown . . . As always 😱😍✌️
... ingenting tingeling
this channel is the only reason im proud of being Norwegian
I like the previous thumbnail. 😊
Yes, but what about the air intake?
This is amazing! :O
this is so cool looking & good looking I would never have the patience to do something so nice
Damn she is so beautiful
Now this is what  I call a "Beast" pc. 👍🏻
This may seem odd but World of Warcraft actually taught me (many many years ago) a cheating way to draw/art/model Dragons. A little known fact known is that WoW actually uses a VERY scaled up version of their cats to use as the same models as their Dragons. Structure wise especially in a game its ALL the same design and animations. Once i realized this its been burned into my brain that if you want to make a dragon MAKE A CAT!! Once you get the basic design of the cat down just work shop a few things and Boom dragon.
@10:00 My thoughts exactly... what's supposed to look like mighty jaws looks a whole lot more like a beak, and beak means bird, not Dragon. Without having watched it further yet, my guess would be the proportions being one issue, the skull being too small compared to the "beak", and the "beak" being slightly too narrow and elongated.
There are so many things to say but one is in everybodys mind: I NEED THIS MASTERPIECE
full release.2:35
linus is in trouble.
thats amazing
That looks so 😎
Literally the COOLEST DIY pc case I've seen on YouTube!! holy word this is so good 🔥🔥
Crafts and gaming is just 🤌
I love that you're rocking the badass mechanical finger glove!  :D
MARTINA THIS IS SO COOL GHDGDHMFHGD
epic stuff!
Now that's a dragon of a computer!!!
god damnit that looks super cool
Apoxie sculpt is my FAVORITE!!!  So awesome to see you giving it some love!
I loved that she used the LTT Screw Driver! :D
Im surprised you haven’t customized that clock yet considering how much it’s in your videos😂   Amazing work on the PC!!!
you look soo good!!
I think one of the key things in making a dragon’s head not look like a bird’s is that dragons have mouths and birds have beaks. The biggest difference between a mouth and a beak is lips. As long as you make the dragon look like it has lips, it won’t look like a beaked bird
YOU SHOULD MAKE A DRAGON SPRIELING UP THE STAIRCACE
Totally surreal :o
Gee whiz idea:  cross creative ideas.  You go to another country to co-build something and vice versa
Vamos por los 300k papu del mal 😎🫡 siguele viejon, puro contenido de alto valor.  Un día rifate en entrevistar un mafioso 😮
This remind me Smaug crawling out from the Misty Mountain in The Hobbit movie, searching for his treasure 😂
Love it Very Cool !!!!
Love it love it love ,it keep it really good work❤❤❤😊
What the dog doin
That is a very cool dragon design PC!!!
Absolutely incredible build and attention to detail.
do collab with NorthOfTheBorder pls
What an amazing woman!
Another amazing build Martia, one small critique, given the fans aren't pulling air from the front but through the side vents now, why have them looking well.. as fans? Why not a diffuser to make their glow spread out behind/around the dragon head? The fans to me are some what jaring as they stand out behind the dragon.. were as if the light was on a diffused layer like the lava is it could have possibly blended it all together a lot more.  Either way though this is still an awesome build and it was amazing watching the dragon come to life through the sculpting process.
Most Excellent!!
OMG! i love your videos!!!
i saw you using UV light while holding it in hand and exposing it to your skin. please be careful while handling this
Is it a "Bad Dragon"? 🤔 ))
sick!
Can you explore Kerala India 🇮🇳please 🥺
Me alone 😞
So talented and soo Gorgeous jeez lol
I can't even leave a coment i'm speachless 👏🤯🤯👏❤️
Pretty sick
Wait a min Wait a min. Is that attack on Titan song modified version in the background
She is so fucking jacked bro, her muscles are huge breh, she pays for the meals bro 💀
Thermals be like 📈📈📈↗️👆🏻👆🏻👆🏻
WoW! Always inspiring, eminently amazing! You guys create and finish off every project from every video so professionally. You are just a little intimidating too! Thank you for sharing of all of your techniques and ideas!
I freaking LOVE DRAGONS and this PC looks so incredible! Great work!
elderflame pc
Really amazing work.....needs more air though😏
I would drop some serious cash for a case like that! Amazing job!!!
Absolutely Fabulous!!!
thiis is sick
The amount of times I have tried and failed at saying Skjera before getting it is embarrassing 😂
Beyond Omega Level PC Build! 🐲 🔥🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
0:49 Reported.
Your sculpting skills are the STUFF OF LEGEND!!!!!  Very well done!!!!  And your pup is a SWEETHEART!!!!
Wow, this is so fantastic, you’ve really excelled yourself especially your last pc build with all those buildings. Absolutely amazing stuff
Wow... may i buy a dragon PC? it so Cool!!!
You surprised me with this one, in that I was totally expecting this to be a 3D-printing job. (I mean, why not? That dragon model would be *so* easy to make into a model, then ==> .stl object file, then print. Maybe this could be a future project, just for Schmidts and Giggles.) I don't know how big your 3D-printer is, so IDK if you could create a full-sized set of side-panels, front-and-back panels, etc. It would be interesting to see how much of this could be designed and 3D-printed.  THANK YOU for removing all that plastic on-camera.  I found it incredibly satisfying. That part was definitely .... a-peeling.  The ONLY THING I would add to this project (no other change), is I would drill out the nostrils and tap a nail through to the back, so you can thread one of those filament LED tendrils into the nostrils.  Because dragons sometimes breathe fire through their nostrils, not just out their mouths... so the nostrils should have a glow of fire light matching the throat. That would be my only addition and I suspect it would be easy to make.  On the matter of PC cases, I'm hoping you can offer me some assistance. What I want to do is use a old PC tower case to build a (FOSS) NAS with lap-top SSDs in RAID array. What I don't know how to do is 3D-print a laptop drive insert for the drive bay.  I'm not using regular HDDs, and I don't want to waste a bunch of space. I want a rack that will hold stacks of laptop SSDs, stacked to allow vertical air-flow, that I can mount in the space where regular HDDs are mounted. (I'm hoping I explained this well enough.) If this already exists, please tell me, cuz I just don't know what to search for.  I don't ask that someone do it for me.  Please, don't.  I want to learn. Can you teach me how to do this? (Have you done this?) If *ANYONE* has done this, or something like it, please share your knowledge, wisdom, wit... whatever.  Now I have to get a 3D-printer.
😯👍
She technically wasted 6 fans cuz they facing the wrong way
I think you are so pretty 🥰😍🤤😘
Great job as always  You should make a entire dragon as pc case it will be cool  I don’t know how to do it but I’m sure you’ll figure it out
I watch every one of your videos and I’m still blown away by your talent every time
Well absolutely gorgeous, the dragon is neat too ☺️
I need....
awesome Dragon PC
The glow inside its mouth looks like its just about to roast you. Very well done!
I don’t think I would survive all the squeaking of the foam
Dragons need belly rubs. 🥴👍
worst Broll ever for something so beautiful.
你牛逼的有點過分了😁💓💞💕✌👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Whys it gotta be a pride dragon? Why not just a rainbow dragon? Smh
Just one word: WOW. 🤯
just peed a little bit not going to lie 😅❤ what it cost for one designed by u i ask 😅😅😅😅😅
If she headbutts you. You're done for 😂
Nerdforge never ceases to amaze me, damn.
I'd like to make something like this soon. Thanks for the awesome video for this build.
Your talent never stops amazing me. It is truly inspiring! What an amazing project. Absolutely S tier work.
Very cool 😀🐲
So awesome! Good job again on another bad@ss project!
Martina and Hansi, I love your videos. They're absolutely great.  So great, that I would watch shorter easier projects as well! Such as... Your clock Please make your clock nice and whimsical 🤓
This hilarious moment happened. Was watching this with my brother and he started complaining about air intake when you were putting the fans in and doing the shell... then that BEAUTIFUL MOMENT at 2:10 happened and I paused the video to LAUGH!!! He DID shut up about the air intake after that. XD XD XD
I only watched this video for three reasons. One of them was the thumbnail.
Yeah without teeth it was like Maggie from Steve and Maggie :)
OMG I want a laser cutter so bad. And the most awesome studio!!
I’ve gotta say, I think that hair style and color looks really good on you, it really suits you and your character 😃
The dragon looks like fatalis from monster hunter
amazing work, what a masterpiece. love it
Awesome as always!!
Ltt would be proud
yk I think she forgot to add the air intake
Now play cyberpunk with path tracing to make it a real one
im surprised you didnt use lave crystals
💯💯💯💯💯💥💥❤❤
Sick.
Simply amazing work!
That's a freaking amazing dragon... And equally amazing attention to detail, not just on the dragon's scales & wrinkles but even the detail of proper coloring for the lava!
Really awesome work, I always have a doubt, how did you change LEDs when their stop working?
Very fuckble
That is simply amazing!  I can't pick my jaw up off the floor!  Just wow!
Dragons are one of my favorite things in the world! The PC looks epic, and I'm definetly going to have to check out this game.
Do we honestly think that Martina could do a bad job? 🤔 Every intro, she doubts herself, by the end of the video she's blown away from her own skills... 🥳 At this point Martina, you might as well stop doubting the job you're going to do, because I for one don't think you'd disappoint a single person, or anyone who's a part of your Patreon... They know you're not going to do a poor job, because you never have... 🤷
I want to see Martina decorate a cake
you are soo freaking good 🤩🤩
Damn so Epic.😲😲😲😲
Great looking PC but I’m worried that the fans are being blocked too much so the airflow is restricted and the PC will heat up and break
Wow! Awesome! You´re really a pro!
Yo! You should make the front fans exhaust it’ll make the red light dragon feel like fire lol
love it 😍
16:17 Aaaaaa.... I am speechless... this is extraordinary😍😍😍😍
LTT screwdriver check :)
Oh man that looks awesome.
If Age Of Wonders 4 sponsors y'all again making one of the tombs irl would be amazing 😍
2:12 i took that personally.
can u please stop looking so good ?  oh yea martina ur kinda cute too ^^  and i really hope u do more with that computer than only ur baclground stuff ...
The dragon pc looks great! 👍
This looks so epic! You are amazing, the vision in mind to build such a masterpiece, all the wonderful crafting, the lighting... it is stunning. I'm in awe.
01:36, pure Viking strength right there, LOL.
How much?
best skjera bagera ever!
.....but waht about air intake? =D
As beautiful as the woman that made it. 🥰
Oh wow, that's one of the best builds yet. Amazing sculpting and lighting!
Hells, yeah, you two! Just Awesome!
I'm curious why you used clear acrylic for the back instead of frosted to give a diffused effect for the fan colours without seeing them, which I think isn't great for the aethestic.
Wow that pc looks awesome make me want to do one like this
I never saw this girl as beatutiful but the more videos i watch the more beautiful she gets
looks like a flea market tee shirt
looks amazing totally 100% gobsmacked!!
GREAT BUILD
Your methods are absolutely insane.  It's incredible how skilled your are at very different, niche and probably some entirely novel techniques. And you use such intense color and lighting and high-fantasy concepts, so it ends up looking like something from a Warcraft cinematic in real life.
Me asking myself , are dragons real , then i see this , now i  believe
There is customising and there is this...I will never look at custom builds the same way again! Amazing job!
Love it'
Lol. The striptease music as you peel away the plastic cling. 😂
"If I start with the dragon head, I get overwhelmed, so lets start with the ground!" This is how you motivate yourself 😅😅 If you have a big project and you are afraid to mess it up, just put your attention to something simple and then you will do the rest, because you know you already invested the time and the materials in it 😅😅 I do it the same way, otherwise I wouldn't start anything.
💭 the wey God did it formed Atom
It might be better if you replace those claws with wings or add one on the other side? Looks like a raptor but it is great work. Watched any seconds.
Use wled to control the led light.
So cool, well done both of you 😊👍❤
Beautiful!! Just I’d like to see dragon’s mouth and teeth having varnish? To look wet etc! Other than that the whole project and process was so cool!!❤❤❤
are you from Norway if not where are you from?
There's not enough like buttons for this video..fantastic work and the dragon is amazing
❤️
Please, please, pretty please with sugar, sprinkles and a chocolate flake if you like . . .   Do the greeting slowly enough for us mere English speaking mortals to understand - even if you do it as a 'short' :)
"This is also the reason our 3d background is running so smoothly" *Sees black screen*
I'm not super into the game, but the books look awesome. Another sponsorship?
I want one!
1:38 Onlyfans?
Love AoW4!!!
Black tattoo ink is made of soot, containing products of combustion  (hydrocarbons), animal-bone charcoal, gelatin and beetles.
Sick!!❤
That's pretty damn cool! Sort of "dragon punk".
My God, this looks soo cool. And I must say I am enjoying the Game.  I also must say for someone who said they have only made one dragon before, you nailed it.
rawr >:3
That looks so freaking cool!!!!! Great job!!
PC design ❤...never gonna play the dump game...THANK YOU😊
Actually it looks like the dragon is being sucked in by the fans and is holding on to the corner to escape
It's cool and all but I want those purple overalls :D
Sweet
I like pc building videos a lot and this.. omg this is a masterpiece!
Wow thats a Stunning Dragon built PC you have made 👍
I love it
Interesting music choice for the plastic removal!  😂  Brilliant final outcome -- what artists!
Every video I think wow they can't do anything better than this, and yet every single freaking time you guys do!!!
i love dragons....great job!!!
What is a dragon but a bird with teeth😂 looks amazing
I could’ve gone for a Linus tech tips colkab 2.0x that was awesome.
You are so incredibly talented this blew me away again!!
Er du norsk?
Pleeaaase...can you maken one for me?😅😜 I need another pc, so i also need another pc case ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Anyone else want to see a video of her recoloring her hair
Absolutely stunning!!!  Maybe finally a PC that can conditional format in Excel...
awsome built, and you both do a great work, might be a little lack of smoke but that is detailing, . i emvy you this . keep make more amazing womnders
mind blown
This is so cool! Well done!  I love water stuff so imagine a kraken (not Cthulhu) or titan crab version of this!
@Nerdforge ARE YOU MERMAID?🧜‍♀🥺
1:42 Just for this - 10 points. Nice work
Smoothest transition to the ad ever
The end result is spectacular. Well done! However, next time you peel off plastic like that, please choose different music. My mom thought that I was watching... euh... adult content... Thankfully, she saw what you were doing. Unfortunately, she openly admitted that it did look sensual... So yeah.... Pretty awkward... But, great video!
AMAZING
AWESOME!!!!   also where do you get your epic music from??
Tu dragón tiene muy pocos dientes y los que tiene unos son más largos que los otros. El pobre sufre muchísimo. No más al maltrato de dragones y llévalo ya al dentista.
I almost wish it had a leg coming out on the right side but man does it look so sick!!!!!!!!!!!
sometimes I'm hesitant to click on a creative video because of my internal artist block guilt, but watching your videos are truly so inspiring and I'm left wanting to create something after every video so thank you <3
This is absolutely amazing ❤❤❤
Hollllyy Fck. Your work is incredible! If I ever get rich, I want a work of art from you
Damn thats a superb build yet again, well done.
Great work! Also whats the music that you use for the videos, its so magical.
I love your channel and creativity. As a teenager, my first fantasy series I read was the Dragonlance books by Margaret Weiss and Tracy Hickman. So, for me, that was always how dragons were supposed to look like. You captured it perfectly and transported me 30 years into the past.❤❤
I'd pay good money to have a 10'th of that girls talent
did I just spot the LTT screwdriver there
Are you norwegian?
Im early in the video... but my first question is WHY waste an entire large computer on just running a screen like that? An RPI zero would do the same thing and take up literally zero space.
Amazing work!
Holy…!! You guys are fucking amazing this is the coolest thing I’ve ever seen
collab with bobbydukearts
You make peeling plastic film so sexy....btw you're hot, to bad i am in my early 60's
did the thumbnail change or am I going crazy?
Would have been cool to have the dragon side be the exhaust so he “breathes” out the hot air
hooooly fuck this is sooo awesome!
it is really nice that you guyz don't let the marketing to ruin your art and creativity. there's a video with 2 built in advertisement, you could easily 3d print the head to just create a content around it, but it wouldnt be you. I think art is going to die very soon, but im glad u just still holdin on!
omg i wanna this
Wow....such incredibile talent. With each new video she's becoming more and more good at everything. Absolutely amazing, especially considering that it's always something new and never before done by her. She makes it look so easy yet we all know it's incredibly hard to do.
This is probably the coolest PC I've ever seen. The dragon is just amazing.
Wow! Absolutely wonderous! Martina, I would love to see that huge "Book" on the floor get what it deserves - a Magical Podium Stand. With a Feather Pen Inkwell and dripping candles. Mystical like you do so well.
2:58 damn, the nice room is not actually a room, but rather just a wall. This is so heartbreaking :(  That dragon is awesome tho!
Bad video bitrate. Maybe you'd better shoot in 2k, but with a higher bitrate?
Love the outcome! The sculpt turned out great ❤
I love the dragon, very cool. Keep up the good work! You make amazing things! ❤❤
Ur next project should be an epic update to that damn ugly clock 🤣💖✨
Reminds me of the raptor scene in Jurassic Park, where its head tries to get at Elle.
the artistry involved in this build is amazing, but i'm not gonna lie-- my favorite part of this video was the pupper coming in to ask for attention and lick your hand.
You guys are incredible, truly inspiring! <3
شرا بيره
Wauw, I would give a lot for this pc. Amazing design and executed super well.
GORGEOUS project! I really need to DIY some fantasy elements for my apartment - by the way, where the hell do I get those LED filaments from? I am so lost :D
I mean... it s powered by rtx 4090.. the amount of heat it generates fits to the dragon and lava theme 😂
Damn!  That dragon head is AMAZING!
"Baking clay is like a quicksave"  😂 I love it!
Totally thought you would do the dragon head with your 3D printer.... I absolutely underestimated your skillz and awesomeness! Touché!
at least its nice to see creators who shill to actually make some amazing like this. instead of just reading a flimsy 30 second script
I don't care for desktop mods too much, but that purple overall is awesome and now I want a purple overall.
So good WOW!!!
really cool dragon
this really shows that art dosent take 1 hour it takes a long time if u want it to look good and this looks REALLY GOOD
Is there enough air intake?
Don't fret Martina. Birds and dinosaurs actually share an ancestor which is categorized as reptile. And since you can't cut the family tree birds are actually reptiles so of course they share resemblance with dragons.
lmao a pride dragon. thats awesome lol
Your work is amazing! I loved how your dragon looked even before you painted it!
awesome work on the dragon sculpting! plus the fans behind the head make it look like it has turbojets mounted to it for extra power
Holy crapcakes this kicks ass!!! That shot with the cordless drill into the eye though.. *wince* ;)
Фантастическая работа!! Фантастического мастера!!! Все супер!!🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
I'm watching Your back-catalogue from before covid times. Gotta say - editing skills improved enormously! It's all over the place, but how to appeal to gen-z audience who can't hold attention to read  2 paragraphs otherwise, eh?
Amazing!
After half an hour my computer turns into a dragon too :D
Nice special edition LTT screwdriver you got there.
From afar, I can only see the two top fans as big eyes, which gives the face a really goofy look 😂
Amazing project! (And thank you for reducing the "shaky cam", this was way more relaxing to watch, even with some quick cuts :) )
The dragon and lava, with the lights, came out looking sooo good, awsome job! That computer is a beast!
Oh man I thought this is a mobile game because of the graphics…
Hey Hanzi, you are a mad genius. How you make all the tech work inside the awesome sculptures and models is really impressive.
Nerd Forge, you are the best! I loved the dragon!!!!
You are so talented!  My 9-year-old daughter is very creative and LOVEs crafting.  Your videos are her favorite by far!  Any tips for her getting into this type of creative hobby?
*jawdrop
Amazing, to improve just a tiny bit maybe put a myst dipsenser coming from the rear of the head or from the bottom under the head I don't know which would  be easier technically...
redragon company will love this
Die Haarphysik ist Wild.
i think they should have use one big red fan , instead of multiples one , but the look of the dragon is amazing. Next time i wouldn't mind watching a racing PC haha
u r amazing..
or make another dragon project and use the smoke machine with LED light to sumilate fire
if you add a smoke machine to the dragon
Does it have... FIRE internals.
The perspective on that window seems wrong,...
Det her var helt sykt imponerede, WOW!
That lava turned out really well! Gonna have to keep that in brain catalogs
@Apple 🤝 @FutureFarming1 🌏🌮
Awesome
such incredible detail looking dragon!!🤩❤  PS: i'm sorry to be that kind of guy, but is that dragon head little bit too small in term of dimension? i think it still can be bigger looking from the space left on final result 🙏
I see Alex's teachings have not been wasted. The cooling is properly done on this one, well done!
Pink LTT Scewdriver!
Love her work, but genuinely love her more, unbelievably beautiful!
You are a genius!
😮😮😮 omg i love your video's ❤❤❤ you are so amazing 😍😍😍😍
Will Cool In Awesome Looking
I need someone to count how many PCs have been transformed into everything but a PC.
Outstanding
nerdforge -*makes an incredible background with a dynamic window* first video with the background : no the window will be turned off
Excellent!
Linus would like this
amazing, I love watching you create such magical and epic things.
Diablo IV PC is what this makes me think of but dragon instead of Diablo 😊
Amazing :)
Dragon scuplting: do this more often -> fun to watch
The dragon looks great, very realistic, apart from ours here in Wales are red.
13:28 ''Ahhh ahh ah aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ahhhhhhhhhhh ah ah ah aha ha ah ahhhhhhh ahhhha aaaaahhh'' - The music from Martina's PC video July 2023  13:48 ''He che voo he che voo he che oo  he che voo  he che voo he che voo he che voo'' - The music from Martina's PC video July 2023  14:45 '' FINALLY! We are done! ✨AHHHHH✨'' -  Martina July 2023
Boot up cyberpunk and it even spits fire.
Wow...that's just awesome👍🏻🤩
Awesome detailing overall, that dragon looks incredible. Gives me a Fatalis vibe from Monster Hunter
Here comes Balerion the Black Dread. Martina, you are unbelievably amazing! You outdo yourself every time! This is my favourite!
That's awesome 🤩
All the pc's youve built have all been dope af I wish I could buy them off you
I love how talented you are.. so creative and a beautiful person inside and out ❤👍🏻👍🏻
The last pc build is already freaking awesome. This one is a whole other beast! Amazing!
You are so talented and your work is always so wonderful to admire ❤
wooow this is incredible!!!
That transition from realistic dragon problem to sponsor was fire🔥
5 minute crafts got me like:
not even a minute into the video and gotta say i love your overalls and the drawing of the project while you are explaining is really great !
can u do a zoom or a godzilla themed pc zoom from cw the flash
Darn glad YouTube recommended me this! All this has actually done is make me desperately want to customize my PC somehow like this. Fantastic, superb, absurd job!
That's so cool! Amazing skill!
i like your work it's Incredible and entertainment a lot.
I think you need more air intake.
OMG Did I just saw you hand drawn all the freaking scales  ?! Damn...The amount of details is just astonishing but the scales thing just killed me.   Hats off to you... Everytime you post a video I'm just getting more and more impressed by your talent !
What's the epic music that was played during the build montage?
I love youuu :D :D: ( Amazing :)
Amazing customisation!
This game needs to sponsor another video so Martina can make another fantasy book, lol
This is so cool! I'm so impressed how Martina always find a way to go out of her comfort zone to learn new things and you totally nailed that dragon! As an animator I would love to see the dragon head be positioned a little more diagonally that would give it more intesity in its pose so it seems like it's rly screaming at us! Looks amazing!
Do you have one of these special ovens to bake the clay or could you just use a normal oven?
You are insane! You´ve got some seriuos skills :)
My biggest design improvements were stickers XDD Your work is absolutely stunning and I love it!
Love it! But have you thought about enough air intakes? ;)
The way i would watch 4 hours of martina building things
holly sh*t, this is a masterpiece
Looks very cool, restricts air flow, but looks super cool.
Love the build love the channel need more videos please ❤❤❤
That is so damn awesomely amazing! You are the pinnacle of creativity! I love this!
let's put a 4090 in our window background generating pc :D  awesome work! it looks amazing!
you're insanly talented, I'm impressed by your videos, amazing!
Freakin awesome AF!!
Elderflame pc gg guys
About your dragon at first looking like a bird, remember birds are dinosaurs & dinosaurs inspired dragons 🥰🤗
So like how much for one of these computers?
finally new video. I missed you
INGENTING TINGELING
Love it! Turned out amazingly well
Here, take my sub, I don't know your channel but I honestly was blown away by the attention of details, You're a true professional. Cheers!
SO... FREAKING... COOL!!!  Been back and forth checking in to see when a new vid would be uploaded, so worth the wait. You guys never disappoint
🖤💚🖤 I remember the first video I watched of you. customizing your laptop into a steam punk case. Your journey has been amazing. You’re growth and skill is just top-notch. Thank you for sharing all of the wonderful things you guys do.
thats pretty good for a girl
Ft. the LTT screwdriver, nice!
I am so jealous of your PC case. I thought my PC look good but now I will never look at mine the same. I thought your last PC case look awesome, but this one makes that one look just pretty good.
Full face respirator......no filters? Uhhhh....huh?
Color your hair blue and cosplay jinX FROM ARCANE i beg u
Please customise your clock!!!!!
why is the clock so plain i mean every thing else has such a fantasy vibe the clock really stands out like an eye sore i really hope she'll customze it too one day...
I don't why i get so excited to watch maybe it's the art form or the artist 🥶
is that an LTT screwdriver I see ?? o.O LOL
Strange looking kitchen.
I love that she still using the glove <3
Outstanding sculpt! Truly gorgeous
Long time subscriber first time commenter everything turned out phenomenal
This turned out AMAZING. And I have to say - the music kicking in while painting the dragon head gave me chills. Like I was facing a final battle at the end of a long arduous journey. Spectacular video
sick
As a PC gamer and Dragon lover and collector, this just hits EVERY passion point of mine, AMAZING !!!!!
Cracking up everytime super close to the camera haha
Incredible the dragon the lights just everthing looks so GOOOD and crazy. Wow hats off. Can you please do another cyberpunk themed project?
INCREDIBLE 👏
That's so f*cking incredibly sick... WOW! That's simply amazing, Martina.
Just wow ❤
Should have spray painted the mesh on intake holes black. Feels out of place being silver.
It looks amazing, but I think it would’ve looked cooler if you left a hole through the plexiglass and neck, so you could add a small smoke machine and the fan would’ve blown it out through the mouth. But it looks fabulous!!
😂"so you can shut up now about your air intake"! loved that!!😂😂
You are a real creator!
loved all your videos, but this one was different, the front of it i give a 10/10 but the rest is a 2/10. considering how much went in to your ps5 project it makes this look sad, the sides and the top were wasted, so much space and nothing done with it, just giving honest feedback, not digging or trolling XD
I love your purple vibe 💜
Came to watch an awesome build, and somehow ended up with tickets to the gun show... 1:36
I've been working on a dragon myself for a while now, I keep overthinking it........ It's basically a mask/helmet I've been working on
Great work as always, love the detail on the dragon head
I don't think there's enough holes for air intake lol.
An other great and wonderfull project! Some inspiration and good idea for our futur new studio  thanks!!! John from France
You are phenomenal
Wow! What a fantastic job!!
This is one of my favorite things Martina has ever made and that's saying something. I have a dragon PC but nothing compared to this, not even close . Geez Martina you're so talented. Keep it up.
O   M   G   🤯 SO FREAKING COOL!!!!!!
I had an idea just now, have the dragon have a second head, like the Queen Alien that would be difficult but could be cool. Just for any crafty people looking for a new idea.
WOW!  It turned out so well.  Love the lights, your dragon is fantastic.  PS, I love your dog.
Martina, I am thoroughly convinced that you can make anything look awesome, whether it's a computer or even a more mundane object. That dragon looks badass! I would play the hell out of any fantasy RPG on that computer. Great job!
que foda
Mastercraft Grandmaster level, UNLOCKED !!! Hello from Australia !👍😎👍
Why does she have that thing on her finger?
I've missed you guys! This made my night. Thank you!
I just need to see a minotaurs, fighting with a wolf sculpture from god of war created for u, so i can die in peace. Dont ask me why, i just need to
I am just unable to say how incredible this is and you are❤❤❤
🤩🤩🤩
I need this it matches my set up
thats absolutely the most badass pc case ever, imagine there being a fan in the dragons mouth
I NEED THIS PC 😭🔥🐉
Bargain Barons sent me here!   Keep up the good work!
Amazing job and also am I the only1 thinking thats a cool mug with a lid😁
Your vision, imagination and talent are incredible!! It is always a pleasure watching you create things that mesmerize and launch a thousand dreams! Thank you,
WOW! That's fantastic!
Aaaaaamazing!
Came here to see dragon case, ended up buying age of wonders 4. I guess that was a well placed ad.
This is so bad ass! You're next project should be making a big dragon to have lay on the top corner of your project shelf like it's protecting it's treasured builds!!
Skal vi finne på noe snart petter smart 😊It's very cool to see this kind of creativity! Thanks for sharing fellow nerd!
What song plays starting from 12:50 mark. Is it Two Steps From Hell?
Awesome
One thing that itches me about the window: The frame lacks depth. It looks like the walls around the window are paper thin (because the are). Maybe adding a short kind of stone tunnel around the window and moving it back a bit would make it look like a nice chunky stone wall?
This thing brings a whole new meaning to the term "monster PC". Amazing!
Best YouTube channel. 🫶🏽
What an awesome amazing dragon!
coconut oil revives the hair
Will you be getting more hoodies in on your merch store?! :)
Looks amaaaazing! :D
tech tip daddy linus's wet peel dream
Sweet dragon, I'm finding it's much easier for me to paint and make color-gami than to the forge for smithing these days, I definitely think my lionentech armor after all my research would be pretty good, armor can get pretty sophisticated these days, and a shame though.
Wow!
Memo Birds are decendants of dinos.
sick  awesome!!
Super sic, but this definitely kills the airflow, right?
Always loved her work. Everything she touches turns to gold. On another note. Gotta love those low cut tops. Much appreciated from the guys,Martina. No way im the only guy thinking it.
This turned out so amazing!
Slow clap...
just a casual question (because I'm curious) how much did that PC weigh after you finished?
Now I want you to make a full dragon sculpture 😩😩
Just the striptease music while removing the plastic 😂
great outfit
1:38 fan are randomly placed!!! AAAAAAAAA
The Undisputed Goddess of Crafting!
One word.... OMFGWTFBBQSAUCEAMAZING.
The final result gave me this vibe: “I am... Deathwing, the Destroyer, the end of all things! Inevitable. Indomitable. I. AM. THE CATACLYSM.”
The woman behind the slaughter?
Wow absolutely amazing work ❤
Amazing dragon!!
That's absolutely beautiful
تدمير عاشت ايدج فنانة
Seriously impressive! Your skill level must be above 9000 by now!
Your art skills are legendary my dear
1:39 "All the fans are in, its looking so...COOL" lol
The cut to doggo when painting the jaw...this attention to detail and understanding your audience is just, no words. So good. Inspired. Inspiring.
Absolutely wonderful! I love it!
Super cool, but Black Dragon's breath weapon is acid, is it not?
wow that 😘😝😍
Love the Nerdforge jumpsuit uniform!
OMG!!!! It´s beautifull like everything you guys make! thank for this kind of content!!! I hope that one day I could afford on of those. Greetings from Argentina <3<3
好强！
I was telling my stepmother this computer really need that much fan because there’s lots of heat coming off and you need to cool that down and she tell me it’s normal there’s a dragon inside 😂.  The dragon is OP Martina you rock 🥰
MSI style logo 😊
love your sculpting. You do such a wonderful job
Комментарий в поддержку канала и ролика, а также труда мастера.
Woah this is amazing!! 😦 I swear your projects always blow my mind and I am always like is this gonna work and then it blows my mind like trust the process is real! This is so cool!
I recognise that screwdriver!! 13:55
I love everything you do, but I will never understand how you can handle the sound of xps foam rubbing against itself... lol  Side boat: I noticed an English guy in a news real yesterday who has had his thumb blown off by a mortar or shell or something in the Ukraine war. Idk, if you can or are even interested, but it would be awesome if you were able to make him a glove like the one you have for your pink finger. At the moment he just has a somewhat stiff, but still floppy rubber thumb. I know it's kind of political and stuff, but I think your prosthetic pink is one of the coolest things out there and when I saw him, I immediately thought of you and then today your video popped up and I thought I would say something. Sorry if this goes against the core of your being, it was just a thought.
making had, but you did it.  it's osm...... love fom india.
Y'ALL. Please make a clock tower or something for your clock!
You can make anything amazing!!! ❤️❤️❤️👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Awesome!! ❤
Awesome ! changing the acrylic front to a black sturdy wire mesh would increase the airflow intake and tame down the RGB fans in front. Overall an outstanding creation!
When I saw the number of fans going in, I thought, "Well, looks like this will be the _coolest_ PC ever ;D"   I'll see myself out.
You are so talented!
that looks badass im in shock love it
Woah....!!!
I can't believe that was only 17 minutes. I feel like I went on an adventure!
now I want one XD amazing job done on the whole thing btw
A daily bugle pc with a tiny spiderman hanging around would be slick
So dope Love it
The dragon looks amazing! I'm starting to believe you can make ANYTHING!
Next time make a PC with Linus emerging from it.
The obsidian dragon the master of the forge fire able to destroy everything in its path burning it down to the ground
OMG!  That looks so fantastically EPIC! 😍  I'm just in awe. 😯  BTW, I laughed so hard at the the passive-aggressive airflow comment. 😂  It seems that's all anyone comments on whenever you mod any electronics, huh? 😅  As if you don't understand that they need to "breathe." 😝
Skjera Bagera ! 🍻👊👌🥰❤️😂 Martina ❤️❤️❤️❤️
about the only change i think would make that look better is a frostes acrylic pannel in the backl behind the dragon to difuse the light off the fans ... to me it looks alwsome but the fans look a bit out of place like that
that is an epic PC, i love dragons and have a few round my small pc room and that PC would be amazing. wish i had the skill and talent to build something like that. mine would probability end up looking like a demon chicken lol.
Does watching this video make anyone else want to play the game. I’m going give it a try tomorrow.
Such an awesome build.. I want a dragon case now :)
As a Dragon, I fully approve of this build. Well Done
i wish i can build a computer
Finally ,,, a content😅😅😅
Looks great but I personally think it needed 2 hand and maybe heated the plastic up and bent it as thought it’s hands where bending it  still epic though
This is so f******* awesome
bad ass, that is all.
Could probably use some heavily diffused acrylic for behind the dragon to not see the fans as much
That was an awesome dragon. At first I was hoping the exhaust from the fans would be dragon breath.
love it!! although it would have been even more bad ass if you put little lava details in the dragons head itself, but still amazing!!
Another beautiful build!! Kinda want my own pc dragon now!!
Amazing work, me and my 8 yr old love watching all the videos.  Was scared for a second Hansi would not make an appearance.  We love Hansi explinations!
😮Whoa! Absolutely amazing. You are so talented and a joy to watch. Your multi-gifted and blessed beyond anyone I have ever seen. I'm from Tucson, Arizona and want to add your artwork in my town.
Good God it turned out so well that I wish to do it my self wich I'm sure I won't do it as good as yours lol
IT WOULD BE FUN IF IT HAS A HOLE ON EVERY SPIKEY ROCK SO IT CAN BE LIKE SMOKEY ROCK CAVE DRAGON
What is a dragon, if not just a really cool bird.
I find that I click on new videos from Nerdforge faster than any other channel I follow.  Always great videos, they are a must watch as soon as they come out.  Great stuff as usual!
BADASS!
You need to name this Dragon.
peeling that film off is some of the most satisfying things ever I'm jeally lol. I love all your projects!
That dragon is the shit girl. Excellent.
It's amazing . And i love everything you do 👍 Wish you all the best.
Would be so cool if you made some of the tomes from the game, too!!! Imagine then in the background with everything else!!
I'm kind of surprised that you went with a black dragon and not a red. Black ones breath acid... Not fire, but other than that, the whole thing looks amazing and you did an unbelievably awesome job on the dragon sculpt! Also welcome to epoxy sculpt! That stuff is amazing and so great to work with 😎👍
idk i thought it would look way better at first, but it feels like you just made a attachment for the front
I couldn't even imagine winning something like this and it sitting in my house it's just a beautiful piece of art!
Awesome build!
Your awesomeness is so annoying. Your precision is exhausting. Your eye for detail is overwhelming.....I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!!!
And she kicks the art form of making tremendous computer shells up a notch or two yet AGAIN!!
This is legitimately one of the coolest things I've ever seen....
Ficou Super Mega Sensacional!!
incredible, as always
good job
It certainly looks "cool" with all the fans :D
Amazing!
Love, love, love the texture!! I mean the whole thing is amazing but the texture work is next level!!!
They way shes so agressive aboiht the air intake is funny to me 😂
I love the purple jumpsuit that you are wearing at the start of the video. Is it going to be merch? If so I want one. :D
Wow, this looks incredible (I like hansi’s hair btw)
Awesome and powerful
Damn, that thing looks great, and especially the dragon head is awesome.
I love this! And your finger looks so goddamn cool!
Martina: I probably spent more time in the costumizer than playing the game, but that's not true.  Me: ... if the game has a feline realm/people/ruler/familiar, then HELL YEAH, IMMA SPEND MORE TIME COSTUMIZING THAN PLAYING THE GAME!!
Martina was looking like the purple woman in the intro and sticking with her purple aesthetic
A dim red glow above the dragon's head would highlight the horns and scales nicely.  Throw that red filament across the top of the inside with a baffle to hide it from direct view.  Put a filter on it if you can't dim it enough (like the painted silicone).
I am in love with your purple coveralls!  Where did you find them?!
Where do you get your shirt? The pink eyes one. I seen the white and now your wearing the pink. I need it in my life!
Really like the voice overs during the time-lapses to explain what's going or the technique being used
This looks terrific and the details are fantastically sculpted
The acrylic undressing music was perfect! :D
Does the lava make it run hotter?
You're a very talented, skillful, creative, delightful and entertaining person. I enjoy watching your creative videos a lot. I thought someone should tell you that.
Wow she is awesome.
OMG! I need this PC in my life!!! It's amazing!!! G8 job!
That is Bad-Ass!! You are an amazing artist.
Love the electroswing background music!
Amazing as always guys
I have the big sister of that case, it's awesome, although mine is black, ledless and is hidden in a corner...
Can someone tell me why she can do literally everything
Okay but that nerdforge uniform looks so good wth
❤🤩great job Martina
I just love your work so much!!! I just wish I had the capability to be able to like order something custom lol
I also have golden hands, only, unfortunately, they are inserted with the wrong end.
Where do you find these lights (11:50)?! I need those led filaments but i cant find where to buy them.
Wow just wow I want a PC like that.
Martina strikes again! With a touch of Hansi on the side.
Nice!!!
What an awesome video - between the sculpting your awesome dragon and using it to decorate the pc?! Perfection.   Now onto more serious business - are you selling that tshirt? Did you sell it? Did I miss out? You and Hansi always have such awesome shirts. I’d love to wear them too! ❤
I just really hope that Martina one day will collab with Dimension 20.
Your works are amazing, as always !  It’s always a pure joy to watch your videos 🔥
Awesome Dragon
I ran across this channel by accident and I have to say I'm super impressed with your talent. Definitely earned a subscriber here! Some great ideas to incorporate in my channel as well. Keep up the awesome work! Nerds unite!
Love your work and enthusiasm.
afhkajsdfglkdgs THE DRAGON SCULPT LOOKS AMAZING!!!!!! and the lava is soooo good!!
SO AWESOMEEEE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
You are so talented. Awesome!
Love as always😍
another banger!!!
WoW
Stunning!
Love this custom case build! Would love to see more like this. Makes me want a similar design but with the scary black dog from Neverending Story.
scary bodega, amazing build!!!!
OHHH so this Game is like an MMO Version of Age of Empires and Civi... Im actually down, they should just market it toward people like "Hey, You enjoy AOE.. You LOVE CIVILIZATION SERIES?!!!?!? WELL GUESS WHAT NUTBUSTERS.
Was Hansi using a custom version of the Linus Tech Tips screwdriver? 13:54
Your art work is a master peace 🔥🔥
Such talent!
Wow. You did an amazing job😱😱😱💜💜💜💜
Have consider making laptop covers with fantasy figures like dragons, mages, warrior etc. I play World of Warcraft on a laptop and i would love to have a nive cover for the back of the laptop! Not with glue but maybe use that material we use in the transparent xmas decorations we pou on the house windows!
Easier way than saying "all the buttons" is "rear/Front i.O"
thats the type of thing i would have made when i was a kid. ill be glad to do something like that someday lol
Coolest project ever! Must have one! :o)
Epic! The dragon definitely needs a cool name =)
POV: her electric bill right now          💀   Really great work though!
OMG, when she drilled into the eye I freaked out a little... such a bold move, but the results with the LEDs and the resin afterwards looked great. Nice job all around.
What type of foam do you use?
The lava was epic! But how you can go from chicken wire to that dragon head is black magic!
I love watching your glove articulate; you did such a good job on that! I love that you embraced the injury that way. That's inspiring.
damn, i bought the add-on on release...
So cool!!
your dragon is very beautiful, and scary at the same time and that's probably the goal you were looking for. A forked tongue could have made the beast meaner, right? I'm not an artist like you, so it's just a guess :)  (translated from French by Google translate)
I just wanted to say you are so amazing, beautiful And so talented. Thank you for every project you made and all of those videos ❤️ we love you 🧚🏼‍♀️
I’ve come to the conclusion that I will fly anywhere in the world to find martina so she can make my pc look as awesome as that
Nice!  Only thing I would suggest is to build some fan shrouds that continue the background fire motif.
totally off topic but i really appreciate how martina still find time and effort to put on full makeup everytime before recording even when she has a big project that would probably take 90% of her day lmao
Once again, you guys did an amazing job 🔥
😂 hahaha the sexy striptease music when you’re peeling of the protective film of the perplex sheets is soooo good! 🍑
That purple jumpsuit with your logo on it looks so good 😮😊
😱😱😱😱 WTF 😱😱😱😱. Would you mod my PC?
Totally awesome‼️  Now I also want a PC like that‼️  Cheers from Sweden 🇸🇪
Sponsored by: Diablo
Gorgeous!
That is soooo fuckin sick. 👏 👏 👏 👏
Stunning work!
SJUKT!!!
I thought the computer looked really cool to begin with.  If anybody else in the entire world said they were going change it, I would have screamed “Noooo!”, but you said it and I thought, “Oh, ok, this’ll be good”.
Great video. You guys are so talented. Also the hair and jumpsuit are fire.
Lol, I would love if ya just made a toothpick one day and just gave it this cinematography and background music, as a joke of course.
If you play around with the iCue software a bit, you should be able to make those fans pulse and breathe!  Too fricking cool, I'm very impressed!
What I want to know, is why haven't you made armor for Hamsi yet?  You have some for yourself and your dog, you need some for him :)
hollyfuck i need this case :o
That's the ultimate gaming PC!
Woooooooooooow That is amasing you are so talented
damn so epic. 😍
Amazing work. ^_^
Soooooo cool ❤❤❤❤❤
This is brilliant great video, I collect shelf size Dragons so this is Awesome. Cheers.
Well now you need extra long monitor, keyboard and mouse cables so you can have it on set and in camera shots.
You never cease to amaze! 😍
1:36 GODDAMN LOOK AT THOSE GUNS
What kind of dog is Nori?
looks great guys!!
Martina…. The sexy asmr peeling 😭😂
Im a 60 year old nerd and I say amazing.  I want one.
Hey Nerdforge I’m getting my first ever pc, what pc should I get, like what are you’re recommended pc company’s?
💡💡💡🕒🕒🕕 You should make a magical clock!!! 🕒🕒🕕 The clock that you use for the time lapse in your videos, you should make it look magical too! 💡💡💡
do a laptop
✨ʏօʊ ռɛɛɖ ǟ ʍǟɢɨƈǟʟ ƈʟօƈӄ🪄  you should decorate the time lapse clock!
Now I would love to see you guys deck out a computer for Kiptoe. Or just a sculpture You sculpt and he paints it. Or like you paint the landscape and he paints the dragon.  (Also knights are something you both like so might as well add that in).  But even if that doesn't happen, I'm still happy to have seen this. One of the most beatiful things I've seen in my life. Great job!
But Martina... are you sure there is enough air intake 😂 jokes aside, it looks freaking amazing!! great job as always❤
Alwaysa pleasure to see a beautiful and funny young girl passionate about creation, who shares her knowledge, with that i work on my shitty english!! thx to you and your man!! magnifique videos, as usual
You know every video that you do that shows us the clock and how much time it takes you to do the project has made me realize you have not made the clock into an epic project. I think that would be cool to add to the aesthetic of your work place.😊
0:49 someones editing skills went up a notch I see. Nicely nice.
That sexy song while removing the plastic cover 😂
Glow-up and a half, and all for the benefit of your viewers! 💜  Sponsored for this one really came through too. That’s a lot of time spent and backache, but it turned out AMAZING 😁
time to redo the clock
Incredible!!
You know your about to have fun modding a case when you whip out a cutting wheel.
This just looks so good, I love it ❤ every time you share a video with thinks you do they turn out so awesome ❤ the content the editing of the video and the quality, outstanding. You evolved over the years and I'm always excited to see what ideas you come up with next.  Nerdforge you guys are awesome and I love everything you guys do... ❤ Can't wait to see what you come up with on the next video.  Stay save, stay as you are and let us all be a part of the next crazy idea. ❤
That is so awesome. I know for sure it's 1 billion times better then the laptop I have. When my mom past away 3 years ago I got her laptop. It has windows 7 on it. So can't do really anything and I'm working on a movie
pure talent at work.
That's a beautiful build!! The dragon is perfect!! But I do have one question...how do you go in and clean the dust off of the fans and the components?
Truely amazing work. Always amazed at how you turn basic materials into something so incredible... Mind Blown!!!
Next upgrade: sculpt a tail to serve as cable management for all the wires coming out the back.
Awesome as ever
Your work is so wonderful!
Que locura. la pc de ibai se queda corto xdd
::singers, 'Did you ever know that you're my hero And everything I would like to be? I can fly higher than an eagle For you are the wind beneath my wings"
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is an amazing sculpting work Martina.❤❤❤
Your level of talent is simply amazing to me. This looks Fantastic! GG!! (it's a day late and a dollar short, but if you used some frosted acrylic glass behind the dragon, that *might* have given the dragon a neat effect. ) That being said. This looks freaking AMAZING as is!
After 4 plus years, you have never ceased to amaze. I am in awe of the extreme artistry you possess.
Hope tgis one isnt given away to another IDIOT
The second she pointed at the sad computer, I said "NERDFORGE IT!" I absolutely love your work! Oh and my favorite color is purple so love the outfit too. The tons of fans however would have made me think "wind dragon" but absolutely love what you did with this!
13:12 is one of the best shots in the channel😭
This one has to be one of my favs. You combined many of your skills for this build and it looks awesome!
would have love this in the 2000s
Dragons! Also, I know both Martina and Nori have armor, but does Hansi have an armor set? He needs to join the club if not.
What was the color of the dragon? Be honest!
The dragon with a Gene Simmons tongue  lol
The smoke effect would be awesome if you could get it to come from the back of the Cave
Absolutely incredible!  Words are not enough to describe this.  You should license the model somehow - I would def pay a pretty penny for this type of case!
so cool!
SignalRGB has a fire effect that would be amazing in this build.  It's a free RGB app that will control all your RGB devices.  It has a high compatibility range for all PC rgb devices.
For a brief moment the fans looked like giant googly eyes and I have a new build idea now.
the nerd in me is always happy to put together a computer :) i just love doing it :D and this is beyond epic O.O
the tongue needs to be forked, perhaps??? the fans look like they are the eyes, lol but its fantastic above all
Looks stunning ❤
That's epic ❇ ❇
What kind of case was that?
Somebody show this to Jays2cent 😂😂
Superb ❤
This looks freaking amazing! Nice Job!   But! If the black dragon be accurate for DnD rules, horns shoud be pointing forward. But this is nerd dnd stuff :D Your Dragon si awesome looking! I love it
I need this but in Diablo IV Lilith style. 😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍
From an evolutionary stand point, they are basically all birds. Nothing to fear.
Perfect art for pride month haha pride dragon!!!
That Dragonhead is really really good. Congrats.
OMG! THE DRAGON!!!??? 💀🤯 My favourite project so far 🥵
Dragons just do scratch an itch like no other
u are so incredible talented. love your videos
wow and amazing.
So amazing❤ As always so inspiring and enjoyabe to watch.
These videos give me joy for once in my life, I mean your work is remarkable <3
I need a PC so bad to work on my music production 🥺 and that is the most beautiful computer I've ever seen 😭 somebody be my Angel and build me one 🫠✨
Awesome!
Daaaaaaaaamn that is so incredibly cool and badass!!🙌🙌
Love it! What a monster rig! I thought you were going to go with resin glowing crystals or spikes at one point. So, now what? Those glowing fans make me think of something steam punk...
you, ma'am, are a genius!
🥺 dragon pc for me 🥺  Having flashbacks to the PC modding scene in the 2000s
Increible.... hace poco descubrí este canal y me parece una pasada lo que hace esta chica
11:55 Very schmall indeed.
Nerdforge NEVER disappoints
Not that it really matters much, but if you're using iCue for the colors, you may be able / should be able to change the default so it's the orange as default.
you know ive been subscribed for awhile now and it amazes how talent you are, Keep up the great work.
The purple suit should be your uniform
How???
Oh my god, Nori is so cute! (13:12, 15:58) Good boy. Could you make more videos with him? 😄
I dont even know if this is possible but I would kill to see you make a ps monitor ❤
It’s a beast
I'm just waiting for the day that Sponsorship Martina takes an eye out waving around her trowel microphone😅
Jeeez this is so epic that I'm gonna buy age of wonders for support 🤩
I love the idea behind this but I feel bad for your 6 fans in the front that are being choked and restricted airflow. Let them breath! Nobody’s going to get past that dragon, I promise you that your 4090 will thank me later and be forever happy and loyal to you for several years to come!
Not only is she smoken hot, I love her accent (:  Oh yea she is also incredibly talented.
I'm sorry peeling that plastic off was so satisfying
My first thought was that you could use the computer as an open stand while you were making the case. And the window would work.
Imagine also customizing the power cable to look like a dragon tail! That would have been awesome! Great work
As always, absolutely incredible. The amount of talent you have!  Also that nerdforge blue and purple T-shirt in the video... I need it in my life!
That dragon sculpture is incredible... but I have to point out how incredible the makeout music was while you removed the scratchguard from the acrylic.  HAHA!
Made me double take when I saw him drop a Strix 4090 in there ... then use an LTT screwdriver to install it. ... hope you didnt have to pay for either, lol.
Can we talk about the open monster that is your PC at the start of the video??? Why are there just wires pouring forth from random openings along the entire case.  However it looks soo good, except the fact the dragons head just looks like it is weirdly floating with none of its parts actually connected at all. But what was done looks good on its own.
2:25 I didn't think I'd see a sexy video on this channel! 😆
AWESOME!!! You two, Kamu Cosplay, and The Smuggler's Guild are my favorite creative people in the world!!
I would get married with that PC in my hands were it mine, possibly actually to the PC.
you're so incredibly talented.  so impressed!
I love AoW 4 and I love your crafts. This is a perfect combination. Great video and amazing result. Thank you.
the filter used on the thumpnail makes your face look like the grinch...
I would love to see some sculptures inspired by Nordic folklore. This is amazing! 😊
This is effing spectacular! I love it!
Expoxy sculpt is the best! I use it a lot for costume stuff, but it gets heavy if you use a lot of it. I've been trying to figure out how to do lit up eyes on a costume head though and I think you just gave me a great idea for it. 💚
HBO should commission you for sculpted pieces. This is phenomenal. Well done.
Martina could make an OF, just reading transcripts of the watergate hearings in complete darkness and she'd still have a bigger audience and income than 80% of the population.
Turned out amazing!  Awesome Dragon.  And, I LOVE Nori!!!  Such a beautiful little dog!
🤪 I love this couple!❤ Have u seen the smile on Martinas face? When she start detail painting on the dragon.
Amazing work on the dragon head just stunning. Can you tell me what the filiment was as I've been trying to find it for ages but can't see them anywhere thank you. And love your videos
14:31 right in the feels
Can you go over your experience with apoxy? Like trials, errors, things to look out for?
nerdgasm :D
Hate to be that guy but as a proud Welshman I couldn't let it pass. From what I can see there are wyverns in that game, not dragons. Dragons have four legs and wings, wyverns have 2 legs and it's wings are prehensile and work as it's front legs. It only means something to me but that's just how I'm made. Much like Game of Thrones and Harry Potter and even The Hobbit all of which mention dragons but only feature wyverns, they look great don't get me wrong they just aren't dragons! So as usual you've done a fabulous build, and as you've only done the head I can let it slide, but it's a Wyvern PC case and the makers of that game need to do more research :-P
Just amazing artistry…..that dragon head Rocks….the teeth set it off…..add the red lights…forget about it….😎
Awesome job 😍 never fail to impress us
does anyone know where i could buy something like this, i would customize my own but i would give up after like 10 minutes ngl
15:09 the fans look like eyes😂😂😂
Who else thinks her purple jumpsuit makes her look like William Afton?
13:54 is that a custom ltt screwdriver? It looks fabulous Nice work with the pc
I *love* the new NerdForge clothes. Fits very well with your usual hair colours :)
That outfit gives me such a Bulma vibe. Awesome work Martina,  keep it coming
You are insanely tallented. Hope some day you will reprint you posters thou. I would buy them all.
Ah, I still have that exact PC case collecting dust, such potential...
It is the best game in years! Such an awesome new version of the genre and a great update to the AoW-games. For those of you who have not tried it, it is like a modern take on games such as HoMM3. AoW is similar in age but managed to stay true to the genre and still put out great additions of this genre.  And yeah, the computer looks epic!
ME, Worrying about Air intake with covering so much of the pc.  Martina an intellectual 1:58 - 2:13.  Jokes aside what a fantastic and beautiful build.
Wild!
This looks sick!
TOP 👍your talent is incredible
The dragon looks so alive! I've watched the whole video but I can't understand how on earth you did it. Amazing!! Always happy to see Nori <3
I did this, but the computer keeps over-heating and demanding gold
best in the game...hands down :D
EPIC! 🐲 Also... that NF-shirt 🤩 Didnt see it in your store, will it be in the near future? 😀
Amazing work, even though I wish the PC fans were less visible, my biggest learning today : a dragon head is a bird head with teeth 😊
This is aboslutely awesome!! 💕💕💕💕
That looks so amazing. I love dragons so much.
Of all the thing you have made, I want this the most
all the new videos of this channel look like every other video of this channel now... it has become so repetitive
Pure art.
Amazing!
DÆVEN STEIKE!!! helt rått👍🏻 🐉
Okay this is amazing I kinda want to start making dioramas.
This is seriously mint. Bravo.
GG
Love, love how your workroom turned out.  A joy to look at!!  You always come up with the best ideas (usually involving a great deal of work for you).  Your imagination is amazing!!!!!  ❤❤❤❤
Computer for me !
Is there anything Martina can’t do???? That dragon is sooooo cool!!! 😍😍😍
The dragon just looks so good! I hope you are happy with this one. The whole design was fantastic, just what we expect…
LOVE this!!! Amazing.  Saw something cool and not sure if you'd want to try it out, but have you seen plaster wall art?  I saw a guy do some incredible murals using plaster. One was like landscape and animals and I saw another video of this guy doing the Great Wall. I'm sure there is tons of videos, but I thought of you when I saw it. You use so many different medium to make your art and love them all.
No idea if you have ever done anything with it, but i think you would love clockwork builds. I can picture some bronze gears around the set turning and working away in their aimless tasks
Yeaahh i'm amazed you managed to get anything done if there's that much game customisation...I'd probably still be sweating about which eyebrows are best after narrowing it down to 5 🙈
Imagine if those fans on the front blew air outwards and there was a tiny steam generator inside so it looked like the dragon was coming out of smoke
add wet gloss on the dragon's tongue and teeth some. other than that its lovely even as is. great job!
All ya gotta do now is run a 8k minecraft mod and you will have the flames.
WoW, i wish to have this pc
I must admit, over the years the detail on your projects are incredible...keep up the great work👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🇬🇧
It looks amazing but I wonder how it looks with the fan lights off. They look kind of distracting
You would make good money selling customized dragon pc covers! I want one now!!
Quite the gpu just to play a back round LOL
you must use a 3d printer your work is amazing and with one printer will be gorgeus ... :)
Wait. Haven't even seen the whole thing but I want the purple NF jumpsuit 💜 lol
such an incredible job , your sculpting is awe-inspiring.
I have said it before in other videos of yours you are so damn talented WOW!
So freaky cool.....
No you are breathtaking!
okay, the dragon is incredible but. totally wasnt thinking that you´re cosplaying william afton at first
Amazing job
I love it, but I wonder what it would've looked like with the jaw not being so... fleshy colored? Maybe a fake flame coming directly out of the mouth too! That'd be badass! I love the texture of the scales, the flaming eyes. Def one of my fave things I've seen you do!
Wow amazing , i always been suprised by You
this is one of the best cases that you have made so far great job
You inspire me so much. I'm sitting at home a lot at the moment with pre-burnout, hoping it doesn't develop into full blown burnout, and your videos make me want to make things, which always makes me feel better. ♥
That's sick, amazing work!🤩
You are too much talented for youtube. Try for something bigger
Warm white LEDs not only looks better, they are also more realistic. They're made to approximate incandescent light bulbs, which are essentially black body radiators - same as lava. At similar temperatures as well!
Realistic to what exactly?
Imo, the warm white LEDs are the difference between 'lava' and 'THE POWER OF THE SITH' This build is awesome!!
Looks great ! As a finishing touch I would install a mini smoke generator in its mouth 😅
Gotta love the fact that the first video with the new setup, is the one with no fancy magic window XD Love the video btw!
Best sculpting youve done! Looks insane!!!
0:17 this is my favorite face you make.. LMAO!!
A serpentine tongue would have been cool.
It really looks increadible! Good job!
Am I the only one who thinks will be amazing to see her on Twitch doing these projects live?
Have you thought of livestreaming some the process you time lapsed? Upfront I don't participate in livestreams but it seems like a great video opportunity for those who do
awesome work 👌👌👌👌👌👌
gurl got the patience and the skills to make such peices and i am here for it!!!!❤❤❤
it looks very cool how the pc turned out, too creative this mod
yas queen
I love when makers do this instead of slipping the ad into an unrelated video they make something really cool as the ad and give the info on the game product ect super cool video and the dragon turned out awesome!❤
Omg your hands make magic!!
smooth lounge music for the peelies on the glass is top notch *chef's kiss*
Have you ever made a trophy mount? The ones that mount the heads of your slain beasts. I think I mythical trophy head would be a great addition to all your other wall projects. Love everything you do, many blessings and good fortune on you and yours.
wait, is that an LTT screwdriver @ 13:54?
NGL that sponsor transition was smooth af. Didn't even skip.
You always make the coolest stuff!! Love it ❤❤
OMG ! Is there anything Martina can not make? I don’t think so. Impressive 🤩🤩🤩🤩
WOW just amazing the work u have put into it well done hun.x
i have the same hand trowel for my garden 😂
The sculpting is gorgeous Martina! You really rose to the challenge! The one thing to be aware of, when baking polymer clay multiple times, is that the more you bake it the more brittle it gets. That shouldn’t be an issue with the dragon since it’s not likely to get bumped where it is though. ❤️❤️❤️
You should have used the tongue as a power button😂
Looks amazing!
This is a video about how to turn an NPC into a PC ...  I'll see myself out.
What an amazing and epic dragon!!! :)
Okay, the slowed down sexy music for the plastic removal on those panels was hilarious.
Can you make custom designs for people?
8:00 "Being the esthetic obsessed idiot that I am, I probably spent way more time in the customizer than actually playing the game."   [insert genre] Barbie is the true endgame.
I love the Process,you look fantastic!!!❤
Dat custom LTT screw driver... Nice. Beautiful dragon. Amazing work. Can you also add a diffuser layer between the fans and the dragon and draw a portal on it? the fans in the background clash with the aesthetic. It can be a good youtube-short.
nice fit
Amazing 🐲 🖤
Fantastic projekt
I am always amazed at all of your creations!
😍😍
It doesn't matter what you do, I am sure it will be awesome that's why I am leaving this comment before finishing the video!
This is why I love drawing things that don't exist. If someone tries to tell you you're doing it wrong you can just say, "you ever seen one? They could look like this".
“Shut up about your air” 🤣 amazing, at least we know you read the comments 👍
Very epic detail work! 👏
11:47 bro that's scary
I have been watching for a long time this is one of my favorites of all time. Very well done!
AMAZING AS ALWAYS
That dragon is PERFECT!!
But what about the air intake? :-P
Hopefully LTT will take note!
You’ve outdone yourself again ❤❤❤❤
Love all your videos. I could watch them all day. Beautifully done.
That looks sooooo good! 😮
I think the one thing that could make it better would be a large plume of flame coming out of the dragons mouth
Oh no, the speaking trowel looks like it got dirty
OMG...SHE MADE MY DREAM COME TRUE.......DRAGONSSSSSSSS!!😊😊😊
I love the Pride Background comment made me smile
wow muscles, nice to see you keep fit :), eeeh what am i writing ... really great work. You are really skilled and I am glad that you entertain us with your videos
@ 10 mins I thought it looked like an Axolotl.
I always look forward to a new video! A question. Now that you have been using the prosthetic pinky have you made any further modifications? Thank you for the incredible content!
Unreal man.   👏
So cool
Nord forge is the best. This is Life changing! I want that PC send to my home 😢😢😢
(Martina every time) well... I`ve never done it before, so I`m not sure if it`s gonna turn out cool...  And every time it turns out sooo freacking cool 😍 You`re a genius!
Wow. I love dragons and this is amazing.  Great work.
I know this is off topic, but i love that she is still using her metal finger glove prosthetic now and again.
Everything you make blows me away 🙌🏼🖤
Looks incredible 🤩 ..btw, before you added the teeth, the shape of the dragon's maw reminded me of the Velociraptors in Jurrasic Park.
WOW! 10-10 som vanligt.
Awesome😂
Wow !!! c'est tellement magnifique !!!!
Beautiful work! By the way...the power button must have the text Drag-on;)
well now seeing them tomes i know we will being a video on them as well soon? i was wondering why you didnt add like a opaque plate on the fans to spread the light it would look really cool
So amazing ohhh god I love your works so much everytime I see it I wanna make them myself ❤❤❤
but what did she name the dragon?! I like how the fans look like spell circles for dragon magic.
Another Masterpiece 👏👏👏
Looks amazing, only thing id personally change was to add a diffusion sheet or something between the dragon and the fans
Martina, I know you read/hear this a lot, but, you are amazing! Your work is fantastic, awesome, mesmerizing!!! I really wish I had the means to support you more. Keep up with the great, great work! And thanks for the fun videos!
AoW 4 is amazing game, but they need to work on multiplayer
That came out so awesome !  Great work!
Wow that is do cool with the dragon 🐲 coming out of the box.
Was watching some your older videos before watching this latest one. And can I Just point of how good your videography has gotten. Its amazing to see your progress.
Each time I thought your channel is getting boring, you do something to change my mind. You are incredibly talented,and skillful, keep up the good...no GREAT work you do! Cheers from Croatia!
As a PC building guy I must say this looks absolutely amazing! Very well done, the dragon looks out of this world and the lighting makes it even more intimidating! I love it!
That’s phenomenal, wow!
Incredible...well done!!!
Omg that's so amazing.  Well done .I love everything  you  do I just wish I was half as good as you
That screwdriver looks vaguely familiar, can't quite place the colour scheme though. (Hi Linus)
Wow <3 Just... WOW ! I loveeeee it !
Why World of Warcraft claimed the game in the video? Very nice case by the way!
I loved the first PC, which was epic btw, this one on another level!
Dragons are kinda like dinosaurs, and birds are dinosaurs so if its starting looking like a bird we are going to the right place, right?
That  your outfit is awesome
The day you don't inspire me will be the end of the world
ahhh it looks amazing!!! just wondering, how useful is the prosthetic finger and do you use it offscreen when not making videos?
The fans getting covered up 🙈
That PC looks great! The dragon head is so realistic looking. The PC has quite the bite to it now ! Great job Martina :) I must add, I miss your pink and purple hair! It's kind of your trade mark :)
epic
Wicked awesome and so realistic, the lights are wicked awesome too almost as if the dragon is gonna breath fire🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
0:03 ❤😂 Love hearing that Norwegian, and love your content, artistic talent, and creativity!
Wooooooooooooooooooooooooow! This case is awesome. Congartulation guys, beautiful work.
Any chance for a Zuul-version? :)
"but i need... MORE AIR INTAKE" you guys are so creative!! keep up the good work!
Why dont you make something for the clock. It looks kind of sad next to al the other beautiful things.  Love the video's by the way😊
Absolutely fantastic love it. ❤
There’s no denying it, your skills really are quite remarkable.
OMG she should make more dragon themed stuff shes gotten so good
All the sculptures are perfect. The only thing I’d change is possibly have a mesh cover over the fans so they don’t catch the eyes as fast.
that dragon sculpture looks sick
The peel porn kills me 😂😂😂😂
"Trogdor was a PC..."
Bahaha! The sexy time music when you peel the protective stuff off the plastic 🤣
the video was better before you put on the T shirt.........
My word. Your amazing loved your work from first vid. I have watch you grow as a channel and you really are fantastic. I have my own nail salon and would love to do your nails in designs you like. Honestly girl A**** all the way. Xx❤
Martina your skill and talent are above and beyond.  I have been subbed for some time and you never cease to amaze me.  There is a special place in my heart for dragons.  They are so misunderstood.  Basically dragons just want to be left alone.  Whenever there is a dragon on a rampage it's usually because their brood has been disturbed by humans.  I have been writing an ongoing story of a brood of dragons and how they try to live out their daily lives.
Дракон из пластилина?
Love this Projekt!... actually love every Projekt you start 😂❤
I feel like you should do some sculpting on your timelapse clock, it just look so plain compared to the rest of the awesomeness all around it.
that many fans. it'll scream like a dragon
wow you are a powerhouse!!
Woah!! One of the best “final results” I’ve seen 😮 👏🏻
Out Fukkin' Standing!
Oh my Sorcery of Dragonology it's perfect, now it's set into your wizardry world!
Absolutely amazing sculpting skills. Immediately after the clip that you said the dragon looks like a bird, it totally transformed into a dragon and I was like "she's got this." Beautiful work as always!  Edit: I hope you restock your Skjera Bagera Hoodie someday! I really want one and I love your style!
Don't we all wish our PC's would be powerful dragons.
If you play any triple A game, it actually gonna sound like a dragon.
I think your arms are now bigger than your boyfriends.
One quick tip: In Corsair Icue, Corsair's RGB Software, there is an Asus PlugIn, so that the colors of the Asus parts match the colors of the Corsair parts.
That add like 100 FPS
Everytime nerd forged releases one of these videos I have to resist the temptation to drop my other projects and customise my own PC. It's just instant seratonin. Just this week I tea-stained papers and made fantasy maps and rune charts. Thanks for always being inspiring! that ad break transition was more smooth than a quantum stabilized atom mirror.
This PC really should have its own OnlyFans account
une très belle réalisation comme a chaque fois que tu fait quelque chose
ur so lovely and you deserve it,, amazing job martina !!! we always wait for your videos anxiously keep up the amazing work !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
🥰😍💞💕
Wait! So the fans do nothing for the computer case? You've already lost me. But the dragon head looks amazing!
Damn, i want that pc so bad
Now, make a dragon themed keyboard and monitor.
I told my friends that after i have downloaded high specs games my PC would breathe fire but now it literally breathes fire not only that but it had evolved into a dragon
this is like hella dope
That jumpsuit is rad as hell
Insane as always! 😮 Did you get tech support from LTT? If not, send them a more detailed video of the finished build. They’ll poop their pants in awe. 😂
Endlessly creative - amazing.
in school for graphic design. when i finally build my first pc. it will be as epic as nerdforge makes theirs. (right now ill have to stick to stickers on my laptop with upgraded graphics card)
Dragon deez nuts across yo pc master face!... *Dad joke side steps out the window while doing a double hand thumbs up*
Do a witch PC next!
Funny thing about our depiction of dragons is that we always put their eyes on the sides of their heads... Where as in nature animals who are prey tend to have eyes on the sides of their heads, makes it easier to spot the incoming threat... And the predators tend to have front facing eyes to much easier track their targets... Just a funny thing I just noticed...
That Dragon is Awesome!
Why don’t you use your 3-D modeling printer for the dragon head?
Now I want to build and customize a cumputer.  ❤❤❤ seeing your work beautiful ❤❤❤
Which Pc case is that?
I love your stuff so hard ❤️‍🔥
Soooo Epic!!!!  I just love the dragon!
It just never ceases to amaze me at the range of artistic skill you guys have for making things...always impressed!
Great job looks real good just a note for people acrylic glue is what you want to use to stick panels like this together  also if clear use optic-clear glue
My spouse has been playing Age of Wonders for the last 3 years!!! He spends hours on it.  He now owns 2 castles and has built up a large army. I think he is currently trying to conquer his neigbours. (shrugs) but what do I know about MMORPG games. I much prefer to do graphic design. Your dragon looks wonderful, Martina!! Especially with the LED lights.
Nice!
Martinas purple jumpsuit makes her look like she's doing a Super Mario '93 sequel as Wario
Awesome job! Your an inspiration to and a positive influence! Keep being awesome
I'm like so practical that I'm sitting here thinking, "but wouldn't you at some point accidentally rub your eyes and get sparkles in your eyes and have that problem to deal with.  I wonder how she doesn't."
Wow, what a dragon! This needs to be in a museum.
I think one 200mm fan would look even better in the front , then it would look literlly like a portal. Anyway amazing video, I just love that she always keep a huge smile ay any given time in the video.
You guys are INSPIRING!
That game would be good if it had content in it. Right now is barebone.
Did I spy a special edition Martina pink LTT screwdriver?
Just.....WOW! Ive been subscribed since my partner showed me the post apocalyptic metro station. Ive watched all of your vids now (and shared some of them with my family)  Massive love from the U.K 🇬🇧 💜
omg thank you I need idea for my hyte y60 build not sure what I going for just yet but amazing work love it
That is freaking awesome
Best mod ever!!!  I would love to have something like this on my PC.
There are 2 main reason why I watch these videos: 1) The paintings. 2)........The sculpting!!!! While I do miss the things you used to do, like the fountain drink machine (the first video I've seen of yours, I love everything you've done so far.
This is simply stunning!!
You just love making the rest of us look stupid, right?
Wow this is insane it's so cool!
Idk why, but I love seeing her using the finger glove she made in like every video now, it just makes me super happy to see, like I'm just like "good for her!"  Idk, it's weird, but it makes me happy to see it Also, badass dragon PC 💙
wow that looks awesome keep up the gd work wish i had something like that on my pc lol.
If the fans dont sound like a roaring dragon when I turn it on I dont want it.
Alien would be next!
Quedo genial esa torre.
E mazing. I get so inspired to be more creative from watching your videos.
That is breathtaking, I love how you combine art and tech. Amazing work!
As always an amazing build. Love it.
Looks great. I think you missed a trick by not having hot air vent out of the dragons mouth though...
This is really epic 🔥🔥🔥 and you sculpted the dragon instead of 3d printing it. that's crazy 💯
First of all, the build is incredible, especially as I’ve been in a dragon mood lately.  Second, this hair color is amazing and I’m obsessed.
OMG this is awesome… then again I can barely play wow on my PC 😂
me trying to do something similar to my pc............ pc runs backwards and starts smoking.
Looks at his PC case... Not a dragon. It's like a hospital room. Boring, white, and serves a purpose. I love the dragon case you made! It's alive, a real dragon, and you have to watch out for it! That dragon might get ya! The case looks so darn good. You guys nailed it!
Good lord.  This is incredible.  The detail, the overall aesthetic.  Truly a master class on how to make bad assery a job.
Nori is so cute ❤
let's face it , she is a frickin artist
That detail sculpting is ridiculous 🙌👏 also adding the glove material over the led string was a brilliant move 🤓
Awesome!
I kinda want everything you guys have done, but this one I simply NEED! Omg! It's awesome! 😍
awww you are so sweet
Haaving drawn dragons for about 20 years by now (my drawings suck btw) it's really the lower Jaw that tells you how good it'll look in the end. for some reason. it is for me atleast.
You look like Bulma from Dragon Ball Z in that first outfit :D
I called my teenager and told her that you had dropped a new build and she squeed. Amazing work as always.
Yay thats awesome...next project make q old time clock for your stuff maybe a steampunk tube magical thingy lol😊
i think it would have looked better if you added something on the fans so only the light how be seen and not the fans itself
I absolutely LOVE your content, but I was just curious why you choose to wear your prosthetic glove sometimes but not other times. Everything you do is impressive and you are so inspiring not just because you’re crazy talented but also because you are so hardworking and determined to see these daunting projects through to the amazing finish!
Every new video is the new most impressive video. You are killing it!
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Nice sexy peel music
Holy Tinky Winky. Now that's a seriously purple outfit. 😊👍
Cloudy day, coffee, and a new NERDFORGE VIDEO I'M SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW🎉🎉🎉
I can't get enough of your creations,  I'm speechless
SOOOO DOPE!!
How's the air flow?
That looks F**kin great!!!! Awesome job!👍😆
Your skill and craftsmanship never cease to amaze. Well done! 🤯
We were here for the peel porn! 2:30
Did you water down the pva or paint it on straight?
Epic as always! I wish I had half your artistic ability.
you guys live the dream.
So, so amazing🤩
Missed opportunity to make the dragon the hot air exhaust 😂
Totally insane! That dragon is just fantastic and I loved the light effects!
You should make new tomes based on this game design 😍
Tar du bestillinger??
That's so frigging awesome!  Maybe try an Iron Dragons Daughter inspired dragon next?
I love this video for many reasons: Super cool PC Build - Check. Highly ambitious NerdForge project that Martina's doubtful about at first but turns out to be a Masterpiece - Check. 😌👌🏻 Starts with "Skjera Bagera" (what can I say.... 🤷🏻‍♂) - Check.  Oh and nice screwdriver 😎
amazing job!
I wish I could start and finish stuff and enjoy the results like you. ADHD is annoying 🙃
2:25 Plastic peeling porn
This is sick! ❤
This project is cool, dragons are cool, NerdForge is super cool, etc; but a game that lets me _customize my own dragon?_  WANT!
Looks really cool
I think you only have intake fans where is outake? Correct me if I am wrong
Cool
Wow, just wow, that looks so great!
Great^^
damn u're a true nerd forge lmao , that's beautiful i really like it , btw can u give me the names of the music u used in this video , i wanna listining to them while playing XD
Is it just me or it looks like a velociraptor🦖
I can't help but feel like that window would be disorientating when you're in the room, since it moves with the camera not yourself
I think if she would use rgb lights that would be so cool like she could create like every element dragon with that like blue for water dragon or nature dragon with green overall i really like the pice of ard that came out ❤❤
Love your channel... you make magic with those hands...
Pleaseee never get rid of that shovel, it's your Excalibur, it has to stay
Mythical creature!
2:14 😂Yeah, we deserve that. But to be frank, your last console and PC builds were looking like miniatures ovens so it's nice that for this one you made a practical and beautiful design 😍 In particular that dragon head. It's just perfect, can't believe that you made it look that good 🤯
Looks a bit like a fireplace
that thing is going to run as hot as can be.
OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It looks really great the fans behind the dragon look a bit odd though I wouldn’t have chosen the clear glass just my opinion all love❤
Du er bare fantastisk! Jeg bare elsker kreativiteten og dyktigheten din. Gratulerer med nok et vellykket prosjekt. 🙂
completely awesome.
Part two you add water cooling and paint it up like the lava and you can make it look like lava  flowing inside the cave
Love the dragon head. ❤❤❤❤❤
that came out perfect
With this awesome dragon pc you should have made a collab together with msi..   But damn this thing looks amazing. Nice Work! Love it.
So incredible!
Flux stay calm.
I never related to something more then the line she said about spending more time in the customizer then playing the game. Do you know how many games I have started then stopped only to create another character because of customization?  So many. Too many.
Hey, what case did you use for this? It looked a bit like either the Lian Li 011 Dynamic or something by Corsair.
Cool I wound if a smoke machine in the mouth would have been possible ?
I can honestly say I've never enjoyed watching an ad as much as I've enjoyed watching this. Your work is outstanding and your passion is inspiring. Thank you for sharing your creative process with us all. Love from Oz to you, your family and the creative family watching this too
Before it was painted, the dragon head reminded me of Crow from MST3K.
The PC dragon looks amazing!
Your are totally Crazy and I LOVE It. Good Job. Thumbs up. Love your creative Ideas.
This looks amazing
That dragon is FIRE 🔥🔥 !!! And pun totally intended!!!😃💯👍💢💥
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAh love it you rock!
My favourite part is how it looks like it's just about to breathe fire 😍
If the dragon is still feeling bird like, it might be because the mouth is too narrow, so it looks beak like. A little bit more squareness instead of pointy might help fix the bird like aura
❤
I have an idea; what if you customized the clock? Like really, it's doing a great job and I think, it'd be really nice to see it in a new shape
Hi ! I think it is one of my favourite projects of yours !  What is the music you are using ? It sounds super empowering !
If you guys made a business doing this stuff you would be billionaires in NO TIME! AMAZING JOB! ❤
overkill gaming setup for just a 3D screen ...
Very Epic Girl You did it again!
How much do you charge for a PC sponsorship? asking for a friend.
Fans look like eyes 😄
POG
Sick ❤
Does she have any other channels??
I hope you know there are neet D&D players that drooling at your case. Dreaming of there own.
Just when I think you can't make anything else to blow me away!  You totally blow my mind and UP the game every time!!!
So impressive! Everything you have done recently has been awesome! Your new studio background is so inspiring! I can’t wait until my studio is done so that I can create awesome things! ❤
Shout out to the pride dragon
This is one of the coolest things I've ever seen
Sorry Jay... you gotta step up #jayztwocents
PRIDE DRAGON¡🌈🌈
*QUESTION ?❓?*   Will you be Re-releasing the   *_SKJERA BAGERA HOODIE ⁉️_*
whenewer I see you uploaded a video I clean my room, choose fave scented candle and pick good snack cause thats how I watch your videos <3 <3 <3
Another fantastic project.
the sharpness of the nose screams bird.. many dragon has nose holes on the edge of top part..sssstilll this one is cool <3
Here ya 2youra
10:39 Martina: The kinda girl who thinks handling a Dragon's tongue is gross, but doesn't mind drilling holes in eyes and poking around in them 12:49 😱😛😊
PURE BADD ASS................!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I wish she would do an uncut video of one of her builds
I'll be honest, I can dream as much as I want, but I will never come close to these kinds of results... it just isn't in my wheelehouse. But what I can say that this is probably the first video, where I am actually interested in the game they made an ad for... I mean I know turn based strategy games played one or two in the past... but being able to create your own fraction instead of having to pick one? Sign me up!
DAMN. That's a beautiful computer.  Amazing work!! Also, it makes sense that the dragon looked bird-like pre-teeth. Lizard, dinosaur-y, bird relative and all. The bird feeling to it before just means you did a great job with the sculpt! :D
that is so badass :)
I was thinking.  Since your studio looks like a wizard's library, you should make a wizard's outfit that you wear while doing the videos. :P
Martina, you are the embodiment of a true creative genius - this video was an absolute pleasure to watch 😮❤
Crazy but wonderful you are?. I'm surprised you haven't been snapped up by a TV company, as I think adults and children would be fascinated at the art you create, it's just wonderful.
Every time I see one of these videos I wanna try something similar but simpler until I realise I do not have the skill to do anything XD
Love everything about this, with one personal change that might be worth exploring. Adding a semi-transparent diffusion layer on the backdrop acrylic (fan side to make it easy) to hide the fans, which would instead create a fog like effect behind the dragon. The fog would still be coloured based on the fans but there wouldn't be computer fans distracting from the amazing dragon.
That is awesome! Very nice case mod. Also slow peel is best peel.
That looks amazing, very realistic. I'd love a build like that! ❤
why not have done a 3d model of the dragon that you wanted and then print it? BUT!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love this
Better 1 big fan behind the head.
The loading times on this thing, man they really Drag-on.
Amazing!!!😍 Just amazing!!!🐲
Your creative ability and foresight  is amazing.....always!
I'm jaded, but that sexy jazz around 2:26. That's what really got me.
The dragon and the setting looks like the one you painted at the oil painting challenge vid, super cool vid😁👍🖌️
this is amazing!!
Love your videos❤🎉
Its disgusting how talented you are!
@Nerdforge Amazing work on the dragon theme PC!!  The next project should be that clock, it's been with you in every video and it needs some love. 😅
what is the best way to re-seal those silicon tubes for later ? or do you only use them when you expect to fully empty them ?
Amazing...😲
That freaking dragon head!  That is so amazingly well done!
The big problem with this video is that it is way too short.  It could easily have been twice as long.
I just looked up Skjera bagera in google translate and it said it was Maltese for “deploy an excavator” 😂
7:25 that was the smoothest sponsor transition ever, 👍.
When the music for peeling the protective foil kicked in, I was actually waiting for techmoan's voice to appear.
10.000/10 .. amazing work. Now i want a custom PC build this amazing.
Tip for Apoxie Sculpt (if you didn't already know it) from someone who watches a lot of doll customisation videos: smoothing with wet fingers while it's still very soft makes it very smooth and shiny, then letting it get semi-cured before carving and shaping makes detail especially sharp
good jop good jop
Excellent video!!! :D What if you had a faint smoke emitter inside the mouth?
11:49 @boylei has entered the chat
Funny how you Trick you fandom viewership into believing u dient loose you Finger Due srupidity. Quite Amazing the Distance you go to Cover it. Such aß mirror thumbnails. Well... Keeper the Cash flowing i guess. Still.. you know hos to do Things but wont join workmenship. Thanks for Wasting your Talent instead of Making yourself  available for the Marketing and Broad Société I guess dumb ho*s always gonne be the ssme
MARTINA that is absolutely insane. like what the heck the time spent on the head sculpting alone??? then u bake it and paint it AGAIN. it looks insanely real and very promising. However i do wish the lava was more flowy-like cos it doesnt really look that real. STILL AMAZING
this is AWESOME i love it :)
Have you tried custmizing a pinball machine? Would be cool 😀
I have to say I feel you spoke to me from the video. When you made the black acrylic. I was like but the airflow. And just as I thought about it you answered it. Then the second time I was like "it looks more like a bird then a dragon" and you immediately mentioned it as well. Very cool build. You might want to post it in Techpowerup's case mod gallery as well. https://www.techpowerup.com/gallery/
I adore every single thing you two put online but this has to be my favorite
I just stumbled across your page and I wanted to say how amazing your work is. The attention to detail is mindblowing
Martina, I swear, your talent knows no limits!
Best project you've made so far, I'm truly speechless and I can't begin to describe how much I'm in love with your projects
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO THIS IS SO COOL
Boa boa 😊 tudo bem 😊 graças que isso 😁
Stunning work as always, love u guys♥
The whole outfit they are wearing made me think of purple guy the whole time. The badge is even in the right place.
God, I can watch her channel forever, I think I can watch hourly episodes. I miss new videos so much, although it is clear that it takes a lot of time and resources to shoot such high-quality content✨
You can choose "hardware lighting" in the corsairs icue's specific device setting and have the light be appropriate even before loging in. It's basically what color/animation the lights will be when icue is not running. Although it doesn't support all animations (mostly the interactive ones)
Awesome!
Yay I'm in the first hour 😊😊😊😊😊   Also lovee your video keep up the good work and also I watched the first video and the painting video
It looks great 💀💀💀😀😀😀😯😉😈😈😈😈😎💀💙💖
Martina, you are totally AMAZING!!! And Hansi to. I follow you and watch all the projects that you tackle. Your creativity in the different aspects of art is so awesome.  I could only wish to be that creative. Way to go girl!!! I can not wait for the next project. Especially love the Castles & Dinoramas , but I have loved all your projects. AMAZING!!!
You had me at dragon
The dragon looks so badass and realistic that If I forgot about it and saw it glowing at night I would freak out for a second
Your inspiration for that piece was a fire breathing dragon near a larva pit , wasn't it .😀😀😀😀😯😉😈😈😈😎😷💑😸💀💀💀💀💖
That is unreal. I am happy for you and your success. Really deserving and well earned. Stay awesome.
we love a pride lava dragon
Amazing work, as always! Just one suggestion: Maybe add some environmental decorations above the head as well? It seems a bit empty with the corners of the Box exposed. Other than that though, it's truly an amazing piece of art. You are verry talented. <3
Where are your cats?
This is awesome! What a great way to do a huge custom case mod without messing with the case too much!
I know you’ve made rogue armor, mage armor, royal-looking armor, armor for your dog, but have you ever considered fairy armor? Crystals, stone, wood, leaves, natural materials for the aesthetic of fairies, but a full set of armor with a pair of wings? Would love to see your take on this sort of thing
Wow, love the amount of detail, incredible work!
All I can say is wow! Your work is absolutely amazing!
Resin glass inside a computer case?
youre so beautiful 😁
one of the cooler things youve done. and here i am looking at my boring old black box pc..ugh..stupid pc..lol
LTT has a pink screwdriver???
Really passionate, skilled craftshmanship, or should i say craftswomenship. Respect from RPG and DnD lover, also love your wizard study, i think that's my favorite and i will do the same in my room
Martina, your artistic skills never fail to impress.  Awesome!
It blows my mind each time I watch your videos. You have so much patience while working on such long projects. I love all of your works!! ❤
Love the dragon. That horn like detail on the lower lip is freaking badass
Shut the front door  !!!!
I really like seeing the idea becoming a thing, keep up the good work and specially the good airflow
That case is absolutely mental!
What an awesome project!!! The detials in that sculp are amazing. Strange question if i may though, what speed do you set your footage to for the time laps sequences with the clock? Mine always seem too slow, thanks 😀
The thumbnail promised me bobs. I haven't been this disappointed in the lack of bobs in dragon related content since Season 8 of Game of Thrones.
Wow! Very cool. Love the new studio design too. Also, I was thinking it would be very cool if you could make some dry ice smoke pour out of the computer case 😜
this is so cool! I'm always looking forward to your new videos and they never disappoint!
every video I'm even more amazed of how tallented you are, incredible stuff
Awesome!!!!!! ...I have no other words...
So talented beyond belief. I just hope you have the time to get all the ideas out of your head! :)
This looks dope AF..
Now I’m hovering dangerously over the button on NewEgg to buy a new gaming PC so I can ATTEMPT to do THAT customization 😂
You should customized your clock
this pc casemod is fantastic ! i love it 💘
This is absolutely amazing 👌
Now this was most definitely incredibly epic and awesome.
it's very cool!
So dragons are just birds with teeth? ✍️✍️
Congratulations on an awesome piece. I'm decades into my creative life - still joyful!
Environment is magical. The person should look magical while doing all this witchcraft too right? Make a witch costume and make the videos wearing that costume.
Awesome work as always, that pc looks so cool x x x
Martina is the living equivalent of quality over quantity
That sequence from 0:41 was great. Loved seeing the idea come to life in real time
Utrolig ! kreativiteten din har ingen grenser, enda et prosjekt og en annen galakse, elsker dere NerdForge🙂
Very Impressive. The more I looked at the main tree root coming out from the cave, the more it looked like part of the end of the dragon's tail.
Lmaoooo the shovel mic 😂
If the Targaryens had PCs.
This is incredible 😮 i've been watching your content for a while , i just love your way of making everything so Badass and whimsical at the same time
You are the opposite of a mad scientist! You are amazing, really! Cheers from Bulgaria 🍻
Your stuff is always is amazing especially your painting the way you layer the colors to make it look so realistic. Were you self-taught or did you study somewhere?
Wow, that turned out amazing! You did such a great job sculpting and painting that dragon head and the lighting is fantastic!
love the sketch development edited into the actual video. very neat!!!
This is amazing and such a fun idea! Thank you so much for making your videos. I enjoy them a lot! 💙
can't stop catching diablo 4 vibes 😅
;)) First Powersupply then Graphiccard !
The front fans should be exhaust, and all exhaust air should be forced through the mouth of the dragon. Also, the color of the fans should be linked to the fan speed, but the light should only be visible through the mouth, eyes and nostrils of the dragon.  Put some very hot components inside, like an RTX 4090 + an i9-13900KS, overclock both.  For show, add some smoke generator to the air intake, activated when the fans are at 100%.  Voila: Fire breathing dragon.
My goodness - you're a very talented artist. Everything you do seems to be a work of utter beauty and complex craftsmanship. This Dragon and it's incorporation into the PC Tower is just genius.
When you are adding more fans to the pc for lights and not for extra cooling.
AWESOME  JOB!!!
everyone's talking about the art (it's great) but no one's talking about JUMPSUIT!!!
the PC mod looks awesome but how often are the viewers of your videos actually going to see the PC itself
Så otroligt vackert 🥺
The studio glow up has been freaking amazing to watch
I would have printed the Dragon with the 3D print, just search for a cool one you like, even if you pay 3 or 5 dollars, it's not that bad... 🤔 IDK, Wouldn't that be easyer?
30 minutes and already over 14k views, wow!
A realy few content creators look like that they actualy like, and play the game that they are sponzored by.
It, looks, AWESOME!!!
Amazing Dragon Martina, "I WANT ONE", PC case that is not a real dragon 😂😂😂
next step is a 100% custom case!! But great job as always
thats the real shit
I needed a video of u guys so much today. It's just not my best day in this week and you always make me feel better. <3  PS: Can I get a 12hrs video of peeling off the foil from the glass? Asking for a friend. :D
That fireplace would look so cool on camera if it had some fire effect lighting it it.
a 4090 to run a 3d background? I'm so jealous! 😅 Looks incredible Martina, well done again!  Edit: Oops, left that before he made an appearance, you too Hansi! There's absolutely nothing wrong with a pride dragon either 😁
I looked quickly and saw William Afton lol
The funny thing is yesterday (July 1) my family was talking to my brother abt his PC (because he’s redoing it or smt) and he said he was gonna add 7 fans and we kept laughing and saying his PC is gonna fly away and he has to hid under his desk bec it’s gonna fly at him
Amazing dragon sculpture!   Also LTT Screwdriver lol…
MARTINA!?! THIS DRAGON???? It’s sooo GOOOD!! You need to make more sculpture projects like this!! Maybe other creatures
Damn with your dedication you could be very very wealthy selling stuff like that
holy shit 1 of the best dragons i have ever seen
Ladies and gentleman, SHE DOES IT ONCE AGAIN ❤
<3 <3 <3 <3 <3
Absolutely incredible 😊 everything about it is amazing!!!!
Your lighting test results are super obvious when you think about it, the hotter something gets the closer to white an incandesces and the darker red tones are just a lower energy level causing the material to glow more than shine so to speak. That means the white one is definitely the right choice and it looks perfect but I'm not gonna lie I would have probably just done red or orange and it wouldn't have looked as good. That's what's amazing about artists. They aren't blacksmiths or geologists but they know how hot metal/rock acts and should look. They aren't doctors but the know what all the bones and muscles are and how they connect. Artists get too little credit sometimes. As someone who's good at designing and building or modifying things I've always found artistic people so impressive. I can't draw stick figures lol
freaking INSANE, i wish i was brave enough to do sculpting but i just know i would suck lol
EPIC DRAGON!
Oooo! Looky! Adafruit N00Ds
I've never clicked a video so fast in my life! Hahahaha ❤ been waiting for a new video. Yay! 🎉😂😂
Amazing as always! Not sure if the case supports it, but swapping out the top 4 fans for a single larger 200mm rgb fan might give the appearance of the head coming out of a portal
Saw this an 25 mins :0
too much fun lol love this, well done
So Cool :D
Needs more intake!!!  🤣 Joking aside, that's an absolutely batshit crazy awesome build! Mad props!  Would've killed for a custom build but there's zero chance on being able to afford something even remotely close :3  Keep up the awesome work you do!
Apoxie Sculpt is the best sculpting material I've ever found.
THIS IS FREAKING AMAZING??? THE DRAGON SCULP IS DIVINE OH MY GOD
15:25 lol
THis is cool but I really liked her cyberpunk build she showed off on Linus's show.
I wish i could do half the things you can do :(
YAYYY ANOTHER VIDEO
So a dragon is "just" a bird with teeth ?
that ad break transition was more smooth than a quantum stabilized atom mirror
wholy crap!!! this girl can sculpt!!!! =D
LOOOOOOOOOVE THE VIIIIIIIIIIIID
I immediately came alive when nerdforge uploaded.
Whenever I think it can't get more epic than the last thing you did you just go and do something like this and completely blow me away! amazing work as always <3
The PC that she tells you not to worry about:
Erm.... those fans are the wrong way around..... heheheh just kidding. Yet another amazing project. If I ever find a Genie Lamp and get my 3 wishes.... this lady would be my wife. And I'd give her the other two wishes. No doubt she'd ask for "Octerine Paint" or something but... yeah. I watched most of these videos, but maybe I missed one - has she ever done a guitar? Or an amp? Tell you what - replacing all the keys on a piano with wood, and running ivy etc across the key-line? Literally a piano growing out of a tree... that would be very cool. Way beyond my skill set and I am definitely just brain-farting there... but... a cool idea. She could do it, no doubt. Hell, she can do pretty much anything. But yes, an all wooden piano covered in moss and ivy, appearing to grow out of a tree. Thats a project fit for even this artist!
looking at the dragon head it makes me think of Fatails from Monster Hunter World: Iceborn and I love it.
Great another computer I did not even know I needed
Wow that's so cool! I love it! ❤
Rawr
i really love this <3 <3 <3
Nori was sooo cute in all the moments he was on screen!          The dragon was okay. 😛
That is a hot PC case. Super hot. I love it.
That is by far the most awesome computer case I have ever seen!  Great job!
Again  another  beautiful build
Beautiful 😍
That is the coolest PC I ever saw in 2023 !!
So fucking cool! 🐲 ♥♥
Only 1 word...Awesome!!!!
Soooooo talented.
You're awesome❤
So cool
Not enough air intakes!
Pls make a diorama again.
She is so beautiful 😍 🤩
Dear sweet god I love that uniform!
Godamn !!!
👍🏼 ❤
This is one of the most insanely cool things I have ever seen!!! I so wish you and Hanzi lived next door to me.  I would live at your house (until you guys got a restraining order).  Then I would just peep over my privacy fence every day to see if I could figure out what you guys were building next! 😁👀
The very last video I watched on YouTube - about 4 hours ago - was Jazza making his laptop into a "beast" and citing Nerdforge as inspiration.  Truly a bizarre coincidence. Wonderful dragon! Holy heck!
Avoid corsair and asus products. So many issues with them.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
That is absolutely amazing!
I'm new here, what is Skjera Bagera 😅
Wow I just ordered a load of fimo 😂 my nf coffee cup arrived this week too it’s awesome x
I loveeeee your work
Yet another incredible build
I never truly know what kind of creative spiral into madness my ADHD will take me on after watching all these amazing crafts.  It's just instant seratonin. Just this week I tea-stained papers and made fantasy maps and rune charts. Thanks for always being inspiring! ☀
Woohoo, I’ve been waiting for this since your sneak peek!!!
I think it needs more air intakes... ... LoL
It looks so epic!! As a lazy person it countinues to amaze me that you just decided to put so much time into decorating a computer, also loved seeing the set in the background and everything looks so magical!! Still shocks me that you bought a whole TV just for asthetics.
This is incredible
U are such a susecefull girl
Amazing! Coolest PC ever!
Was a❤
omfg i am in loveee
Watching Nerdforge and painting. The best combo
*Skjera Bagera* 🇬🇷💙🇳🇴  I would love to see you making a weirwood tree from Game of Thrones. An actual model of it with clay or whatever and led lights for the eyes and mouth and the leaves… It would be amazing!!
Awesome, it's magical art ✨
Nice room!
Why is she dressed like the man behind the slaughter
Not the sensual music with the satisfying peel 🤣🤣
She actually looks like a witch in that thumbnail!
Du er fantastisk❤
This girl can make anything u can think of and I love it❤❤
Remove the fans to get a fire breathing dragon!

You kinda look like amity from the owl house with your hair tied back
Cool!
❤
I guess water cooling this one is out of the question haha, this looks amazing!!!
Please make a lifelike looking artifical pinky finger with glove

Everytime nerd forged releases one of these videos I have to resist the temptation to drop my other projects and customise my own PC
