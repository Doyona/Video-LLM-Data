Happened to me. It's not cool. I whacked a Mini same colour as yours lol.
Relax bruv, its a little dent on your car. Typical youtuber.
Watching this video after I messed up in a car park to feel better about crying about it
Should really be more careful lad
The good thing is that you are okay BABE❤️🙏
I’m so sorry, it’s so emotional to see u like this love u❤️
CARMIE IN THE TOWEL NO
Hope ur feeling better now
is no one going to mention the vodka to lucozade ratio, get it girl 😌id die but im proud of u xxxx
Aw I’m so sorry
you NEED to go brown!!! that would look so nice on you omg
Lol she crying what would she do if she had no food this week cause she had to pay her insurance I’m confused why she’s upset tbh
Youtuber: spends thousands on a spa trip while the rest of her country can't afford to pay rent One unfortunate event Youtuber: Worst week ever boo hoo
oh lawwd Kate
ChAoUs
Sorry but what mascara did you use because it really came through
Big hugs lovely ❤️
Most drivers have an accident at least once ! really knocked my confidence when I crashed in the first 3 months of driving. But u know what now I never make the same mistake now and ive been driving 5 years! You're both safe that's the main thing! x
sending you all my love - peace and healing. so sorry you had a rough few days. You are so loved xx
Kate those tests are for people with no symptoms it’s probably best to do a PCR test 💕
It's awful having a bump in the car! I've had 2, one my fault, one not my fault and honestly it's so scary even when it's a little one! Drive slow and carefully everyone 💖
Didn't knock any sense in to you did it? You sound like you were deprived of oxygen at birth.
Glad you're ok. A couple of months ago I was rear-ended by a semi. Caused me to hit another vehicle. Completely totaled mine. Luckily, walked away. It was awful. Even fender benders are stressful & feel like crap. You'll feel better when ur car is fixed.
I LOVE OZARK
These accounts man lol
Oh no... hold the phone people in Yemen
Lol
You did this video before you traveled the last time right? because as far as i know people can not travel anywhere if they are not inyected.
I couldn't pay my bills this month.  (Another month)
Hope next weeks better for you x
Glad you’re ok. Just been in a crash today on my motorbike but I’m lucky I’m all good x
Lol not me having those exact symptoms and it ending up being covid delta 🙃😅
Kate it happens to the best of us ♥️ hope insurance sorts it out and all is smooth!!
dont care lol
L
take ur time to chill out Kate!! hope ur ok x
Who is this nobody? And why does YouTube think that I'd give a fuck?
I just payed 2 grans out because someone went into our light and rexked the bull joint and something else hope u ok xxx
You kinda look like the YouTuber sienna santer but British
hun everyone gets into car accidents, even the best drivers have a lapse of judgement. you've done well to be driving this long and haven't had one until now. i know how much it sucks, i had my first (and only touch wood) accident last year and it was horrid i had no idea what to do, especially as a younger driver you feel like everyones looking and judging you for it. it'll all be sorted soon enough and you'll laugh about it one day! super glad no one was injured and don't let it knock your confidence! sending hugs babe x
The video would be better if carmie wasn’t in it
not kate hating on girls who like football and turned into that girl
just give your liver a rest girl :)
The rapid tests are really unreliable, I took 2 tests which both came back negative and when I took a PCR test it came back positive, you should take a PCR test if you still feel ill before your holiday xx
You're so cute🥰🥰 I'm sorry about the accident hope you feel good soon :(
you should read the Eddie Flynn series Kate it’s so good!
Amy’s Kitchen as a gluten free bitch absolutely SLAPS. that shit is bangin
If it makes you feel any better Kate I reversed my works car into someone at the traffic lights 🙃🙃🙃 sorry this happened to you I reacted in the same way, glad you’re okay! ❤️
Aw the beginning of them in the spa gives me happy vibes - we like that they are in love again :)
oh lawd kate
I'm so sorry that this happened to u, u don't deserve it, we're all here for u, I'm so glad that ur not hurt, i know its rough but it will get better i promise, ur such an amazing, gorgeous girl inside and out, sending u a big hug, stay positive queen, love u lots xxxx
when i got in my first accident i was  sobbing on the curb and the lady was in my face screaming at me that she was going to be late for work 🙂 glad the guy was sweet to you, the situation absolutely sucks but it helps a lot when the people involved are calm and understanding
Hey the rapid test is really unreliable for the new strain lots of my friend tested negative then tested positive on pcr test so if u still feel Ill get pcr xx
entertaining video
shut up
you have covid lol been there
As someone who’s been in a car accident, sending so much love and healing to you ❤️❤️❤️
I fkn HATE it anytime someone is driving right behind me with like no distance just because something like that can happen. Good thing no one got hurt and I hope you'll be more careful in the future
Oh Shit! So Terryfying! I'll hope you all get better spoon. You should know that you really make the life worth living! ❤🔥❤🔥❤🔥❤🔥🇧🇪
Jack grealish mood 😍 hope ur okay girl xxx
Kate where  was your Italian shirt surely Carmie would of told you Italy were never going to lose  LOL
just got off a stressful morning at work serving people their brekkie so when i say this is the best thing to come back to i mean it. love ur uploads frfr
How did you get your second vacc so early? where did you go?!
The vaccine bit did it for me😂
i got rear ended by a ute last year and i was the same as you. i was sobbing because i had never been hit before and it was just terrifying, and it’s completely okay to be shook up and stressed over these sorts of things. hope you’re okay xx
the jack grealish montage
I feel you:  If don’t make time for you wellness, your body will take your time for illness.   Hope you’re feeling better soon Kate X ❤️
I hope your ok Kate!! take time if you need. we luv u always!
kaaaaate, you are such an angel, i'm so sorry you had such a rough week! truly hope its only uphill from here, thanks for always being so honest and vulnerable with us, even when you're going through shit! sending you lots of love and positive vibes, always looking forward to your next upload (and here's hoping it will be of better times!!) glad you're safe from your crash and hope you're feeling better and more relaxed now, look after yourself girly!! xxxx
