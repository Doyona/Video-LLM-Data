Play me a melody that will last the rest of my time. Something like what you did in Drumhellar wish I knew you were here
How is it possible to write such amazing lyrics and melodies?  I love your mix of blues and hip-hop!  As you said yourself in the song ‘Hi Ren’: ‘I’m a genius.’ Yes — you are!  I’m at a loss for words to express the praise you deserve!
Best music in years brother 😀

when he takes that bag off his head he trades one noose of hessian rope for another of satin silk weave
Just how badly being a child prodigy can end…
It's like watching a Shakespeare play.
Anyone else think this guy would make an amazing Joker? Musical or otherwise.
Beautiful ❤

Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy One years old and his first words were mine, mine gimme Two years old, he was walking, three years old, walking quickly Four years old, he was running around the pavements of his city Five years old, and his daddy told him, listen here son, you've got to learn to be a man A man he works for what he wants Six years old, and he's reading, writing, top of the bunch And when he's seven, his progression made him student number one Eight years old and he's praised for unusual grades Nine, his parents pay for private school to nurture the flame 10, 11, 12, 13, he ascends and ascends, his daddy tells him, son, money is the means to all ends 14 solving complex mathematic equations, at 15, IQ 150, still elevating 16 he develops complex software code that detects weaknesses in cyber security protocol  17, and he sells his vision, keeping the share, not yet an adult But he's practically a millionaire 18, and his daddy tells him now you're a man the world don't give a damn about you So take all that you can 19, he turns a profit, stocks and shares, invest in product 20, double down deposits 21, his income rockets 22, he learns that truth is just an obstacle to wealth If you manipulate the data, then the lie will sell itself 23, a life of luxury Crystal and cocaine 24, he makes the Forbes list, they're applauding his name 25, and his daddy told him, listen here, son, while you're sitting in the palace That don't mean that you won 26, his business shifts, he switches business to arms He's 27, dealing nuclear shells in Iran 28, inside the Senate, money bought him a seat He's 29, role of counsel in the president suite And now he's 30, his daddy says, you're losing the race You're just a servant to the king, not even in second place 31, a big maneuver for his daddy's approval Moving imports over borders from the exports out of Cuba 32, moving grams, growing kilo to tons He's 33, filling warehouses with powder and guns 34, turf war with nobody to stop it, blind eye from the Po po inside of his pocket  35, he gets a call, I'm sorry, son, but it's your father, had a heart attack I'm sorry, he's gone, 36, getting pissed off abusing this product 37, eyes glazed, disposition demonic 38, with a prostitute, a moment of passion Heating up the silver spoon and then chasing the dragon 39, getting reckless and hungry for power Daddy's words still driving him to kill him and devour He makes a move against the cartel, but the strategy's flawed They retaliate and leave him in the hospital ward A bullet buried in his vertebra, and one in his leg The doctor sighs and says, I don't think you'll be walking again, fuck  Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy He was 40 and he cursed the words mine, mine gimme 41, he wasn't walking, 42, not walking quickly, 43 Never running round the pavements of his city 44 inside a palace with a mountain of gold But those riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves Weighing heavy on his conscience is the value of gold, Lamborghini for a life Trading money for souls, Jimmy followed the code inside the land of the free Put your hand inside the cookie jar, take more than you need And his example is exaggerated versions of me, and it's a version of him And it's a version of she, and it's a version of you There's no escaping the blame, the way we live, it's parasitic Fuck the money and fame, cut the music  This isn't entertainment, this is real life, the way we live is lunacy, community it declines Hyperpolarized, always fighting and we divide Truth is less important than the money that we designed? Money's an invention, politics from our invention, they all come from people's ideas Did I mention, border's an invention Law and order fuels the tension that leads to people killing each other My solution? Everything is subject to change We could build utopias if individuals were taught to use their brains But if we teach kids in schools to always be sheep and put themselves before the herd If there's more money for meat Then there's no future I see where the humans survive We're parasites inside the Petri dish, with cannibal minds Mold will grow upon the surface, then consumes 'til it dies And our fate could be the same without this story to the wise 45, Jimmy comes home out of the rain, soaking wet upon a wheelchair Drinking again, he has everything he wants, he has fortune and fame Such a fortunate fool with an unfortunate fate with a 45 caliber aimed at his brain 45, a fitting number cause his age is the same Here's the words of his father, it's such a damn shame Then he presses on the trigger of a money game
❤❤❤
I know he said that this is not  entertainment, is real life. But sorry I got amuse.

So F-ing good

Your music hits different when drunk.
I'm an old redneck from Texas.  I can say I'm a musician, for certain,  but wouldn't necessarily call myself an artist, but certainly can't define art itself so what do I know?   I'll paraphrase Al Pacino in The Devil's Advocate:  THIS young man right here is the hand up Mona Lisa's skirt.  If this, and everything he does isn't art, I wouldn't know what is.
just real . pure .cant say no more . bless
I wish people could see how self-destructive this entire society and culture we maintain is.  Yet they treat it as the only thing keeping them alive.  They won't confront that the thing they preserve is what's killing them, not preserving them.  If it has to burn, it's only because those who held on were too cold hearted to see the suffering in others.  The refusal to see the pain in those around you, the same reason you can't recognize it within yourself.

Been sharing this with all my friends
B-E-A, Utiful. Please tour the west of Ireland.
Uffff! Genius. Ren ❤❤❤
Greatest artist I've ever witnessed...❤
I lost someone to this. I hope people would listen and understand, but it only seems to get worse every day. You are a mad genius. Thank you for harnessing your energy and talent to speak these painful messages to the world. I’m sure it comes at a high personal cost.
Unreal
Its kind of crazy how Ren can tell a story better in 9 (only using like 7minutes to tell the story) than movie studios in 2 hours
You truly are the best! no crap... f youtube
WW
He would be a great actor for a young Tommy Shelby.
Absolute genius.  Never has an artist effected me the way Ren has. Nothing in his catalogue is worth skipping.  Long may you continue Ren
the lip sync is ever so slightly out
This song is truly a masterpiece of art. Not only the music itself sounds great, but also the cinema-worthy videoproduction is awesome, aswell as this powerful message. Every once in a while, I keep coming back to this video here on youtube, because I love to admire this genius piece of art. Usually I never comment on videos, but after I've seen this masterpiece so many times, I just feel like I have to put into words, how much I admire not only this song, but Ren as an artist. He's a real blessing for the world and everyone who found his music, can count himself lucky, to see and feel his powerful art.
Fun fact this song and Hi Ren have similar thumbnails and the same run time
This is a whole new level of genius 😭😇
oh. my. god
Great lyricist ren love ya ❤🎉
a
Came from insta
Yes. Ren
Rewatching for about the 100th time and absolutely love
🎉😂😅😮😢🎉😂❤ 3:09
Still inspires even after 1000 times ❤
all the money in the world and he can't walk? You can custom make bionic limbs, stop being mopey. Actually this shit is exactly what leads to technological revolutions in the first place. Capitalism not working is the plot hole here.
Pure Poetry!
#TooReal#Amazing
!
That’s just fing perfect. YouTube slaps a pop-up on this video asking me if I want to shop for products used in this clip. On THIS video.
Genius.
Money isn't everything, but it sure helps to have some.
Auteur conteur d histoires waouh

Mind blowing

Facts.
Love every second of this masterpiece.  Sadly also feel a bit like Jimmy (not good enough in eyes of the father). Much health to you my friend.
Wow....
Masterpiece 💥
Masterpiece 💥
Plz like my comment so i can come here back 😢
All
Holy shit. Ren, you are incredible.
This guy is a genius
Sheer talent! A emotional rollercoaster of the soul! Everyone got a story! He tells storeys so well!
everyone commenting on how great the song is and how great the filming is.. i agree but can we discuss his piano skills, my god dude, guitar, piano. how many instruments do you know. whens the song on the accordian coming xD
I understand your brain, born march 26th 1992.
Why is this man not a household name!🔥
Hauntingly beautiful
I N C R E D I B L E ❤
What’s go what's good for you’d for the goose is good fo is Goode the ga for the gandered
You can find my sculpture in Venice tge lady with the broken finger that’s the one I use to suck when I was a child.   I picture saved on one of my phone accounts which is archived I clouds akhas Cathie records the informs 2:20
the men who suffer all of that and survive are the ones who reign us right now. i feel weak...jaja I know :D at least thats what I think.  It is so hard to articulate your feelings. you cant even understand your traumas, why even bother with the world.  I am not that guy, you are not that guy, we are all not that guy. We are a team and learn. Please shut down your ego and fuck ppl, who want to fuck the world. thanks. #youknowwho
Thank you . So creative and true . Wish you all the best.
this is the best music around and Ren , your right in " HI REN " the people who find you music they respect it . If i ever got to meet you i think i would die inside a little ... This is a kid BTW youve got this
Commenting for the algorithm. What a beautiful piece. Please like so I can revisit ❤️
Ive never got so many goosebumps and tears this man is generational
0:41 a bit of Magritte in that pic?
Wow someone took some out my words.  I am 67 and I don't get pleasantries surprised by musicians. You are so talented yet tonight was the 1st I ever listened to you.. on a Facebook clip no less.  As a recovering addict and alcoholic Hi Ren was so similar to the battle of ego control Vs release. This battle never leaves us but gets better if...
I actually dig u ren just cant stand these generic fans bro, almost like bieber fucking fans so weird.
If only every person found their passion and their drive was fueled with real motivation as Ren due to his health... And like me ...
He's my favorite artist. He a true bard
Ren
Ren, your music is out of this world
Discovering Ren… and hooked, mesmerized, broken, mended… it’s healing and the rawness and beauty are too good to be true!
Great
It’s so f…..g awesome how you can put life experiences into the power of words in amazing sentences which I can completely relate to. And damn…I feel this one….very hard…
I like the piano really familiar to I. Allegro molto moderato
Man, whoa!
You are just a genius your words are masterclass ❤
I feel like I am at least 1 million views on this video alone
The setting is so creepy, where is it?   It looks like an abandoned old mental hospital etc.   The one from "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" is a IRL place kinda near my house, they turned it into a museum of like, horrible historical attempts at healing mental illness but in a way that shows self-awareness and improvement.   Cool place but not a nice place.
Keep the algorithm on this man at all costs!
It gives even more watching these video clips. Incredible!
I gotta know… was the gun really loaded?
wow 🫩🫩🫩
ion like this 🫩
goddamn. HOW THE FUCK this masterpiece only has 11 million views???
If Ren did a US tour, Grandson would be a great match up.
We need a behind the scenes bro
He got a resemblance to young cillian Murphy
I love your merch Ren but i dont want to be constantly part of this old money game 😭😭
Language woven like fine silk
44 year old American mom of 3…can’t even describe how I feel watching and hearing Ren perform. He is a beautiful soul.  💫
Classy!   xxx

Masterpiece
we need a new money game, more spesific
Again, this is simply the greatest thing I have ever seen and heard. Ren is a genius.
1:58 sounds like a James Bond melody I love it🤍
I listen to this song and everytime it gives me goosebumps. It's so good and so true.
😢
his voice!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Cut the music" got me.  I put my phone down.  When he sat down with the gun and it started to rain, all I could do was breathe deeply like everything is okay.
This song with the airpod 4's in hits different
I am very grateful for the person who introduced me to this video. ❤
I am so in love with Rens mind.
Drop it into vinyl.
omfg he looks just like the guy in cloud atlas when he shoots himself... genius... new favorite rapper.
This is what the world needs ❤❤❤
This masterpiece tells a story most are never told so every time someone likes this comment I will be reminded of this masterpiece
I'm breathtaken.
The lyrics always make me feel some way, but I never stopped to watch the videos and holy hell do THEY make me feel some way.
Hot dang was that one unbroken cut from 0:44-5:40? Amazing.
I wish I could see how that video was made… I hope there was a camera on the ceiling filming everything! And we’ll get to see it! I don’t even know how many times I’ve watched/listened to that video. Absolute perfection. The story, the music, the video…
Man 🔥
I absolutely am impressed with this genius
Can someone explain to me who Vincent is in relation to Jenny and screech

This is just art !!! Lyrical intelligence ❤
Algorithm boost by one comment
Exquisite
Opioids… a very serious epidemic!!   Lost my daughter due to opiates!!! Injury in cheerleading that lead to addiction😢. God  help us 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Love this Song, sadly you messed up with the weapon, NEVER EVER PUT THE TRIGGER FINGER TO THE TRIGGER! HOLD THE FINGER ALONG THE GUN NEXT TO THE TRIGGER, and just when you are shure to shoot, move the finger to the trigger... even in situations like suicide, cause you could hurt yourself so bad, you even couldnt end it.
This is very very close to the bone. Fitting age now...
Genius.
you are insane <3
This song evolved my parent's PERSPECTIVE!
I literally come and listen, watch this once in a while when i need when i dont want to care about all the stress in my life all the future problems i just come and listen and Ren, thank you for openning our eyes..
Very good. Was suggest by Warren Thomson
"then theres no future i see when the humans survive we're parasites in side a petre dish with canible minds mold will grow upon the surface and consumes till it dies and our fate could be the same wihtout this story to the wise" ive listened to this song alot but to be honest i skip over the long pauses, and somehow i missed this line
Love ren ren ren a genius ❤

This is fucking incredible no words can describe how stunning
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Love Ren — yeah, I’ll say it again, But he’s selling clicks just like all of them. Vying for attention, crafting up those little stories, Masks on faces, yeah, he makes it kinda gory.  Insightful pause — then he’s dreaming like a kid, Wants the world to hand him gifts for everything he did. Talks like he’s above it, like he’s living on a mission, But bro, don’t pretend — you still want that subscription.  Money in the motive, yeah, that’s not a sin, But don’t be so dismissive when the greed creeps in. You’re chasing views, too, it’s the same old game, Dressed up in some poetry but chasing the fame.  Acting like the prophet, spitting wisdom on the mic, But every bar’s designed to get that algorithm right. I see through the story — the depth and the plan, It’s art and it’s commerce all stitched in your hand.  We all want connection, a little truth in the noise, But behind the revolution’s just a brand and some toys. So take off the halo, put the mirror to your face, We’re all hustling for the same damn space.
Goosebumps mate 20 out of ten. My whole bacck twitched. You got  da skills fella
Wow…… that is all
This man is pure genius. Definitely not getting the credit he deserves
My God you are incredible!!! I want to watch a whole show of this ❤
MASTERPIECE 🎉❤
British ppl pls, you were one off  the first to be introduced to digital id, and you are the ones who will decide all our future. So please stand up and don't  obey !!!
Spirituality. Not a business.
4:30 - Blind eye from the Popo inside of his pocket…  There lies the problem with Todays most powerful people and Yet No one to Stop it (look at that I added to his rhyme)
Incredible ı dont get it why People dont listen the real rap
Who says music is dead?
Brilliantly conceived and executed. A genius of perception. But am I wrong to think of DJT?  “A cynic is a man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.” Oscar Wilde
Ren should do a Money Game part 4 about Digital IDs!!!
Incredible
Perfect masterpiece so we'll go down in history! Hopefully the right quadrant of history of the people except and educate the youth with
Fu*k the money and the fame
Just some story
The world needs to sit the heck down and listen to this man.  Real talk. He's got so much to say i wish ppl can get in that level and care
I'm so much content now I found his music. No joke
O wow! Spektakularne ❤️‍🔥
🖤
If you have recently discovered Ren... welcome to the revolution
❤wow wow wow 🎊
Best bit of art I've experienced
This masterpiece will never be topped fucking conductive emotion through art first ever genius and absolute genius
Este chico es el pu to amo

Leaving a comment for the algoritm
This song came out on my birthday. Wow :0
Wow. That's all I have to say. Just wow.
Absolutely fucking extraordinary
this world do not give a damn about you so you take all you can
Ren needs to keep doing what he does.   It's art,  it's beautiful, it's magical and it hits home
OBE
REN. YOU ARE BRILLIANT.
Art
Only recently discovered Ren. This guy is amazing- it's music, art, poetry, storytelling, social commentary- everything!  Music has got so boring and meaningless, I'm so happy to find someone who has such talent and produces music that speaks of real life , makes you think and evokes real emotion.  And I'm a middle aged woman so probably not the demographic , but I'm a new fan! 😀
Over 11 million views in a yr is CRAZY WORK... This guy is incredible. And looks impeccable in the beginning in that suite, when he removes the bag..  🔥🔥
Amaizing.
Thomas Shelby?
Dear diary. Today algorithm was pretty great.
nice!  theres also apart about us being a random species of the bunch who was elevated to being where they are now, and this process took tons of time.   and we wouldn't even know about it, cuz humans, searching for what this existence actually is (accuracy + science is something that evolved in the animal mind, imagining potential scenarios as solutions is also something that evolved in the animal mind)  so yeah, we sort of find ourselves here, right?  how can i even claim i know about this place?  i didn't even know i was one of the animals.  i didn't even know im composed of microbes.  i didn't even know about quantum mechanics, atoms, and the cosmos.  im discovering this place, and looking to see what we could do here.  i agree, the ideas you've described are unhelpful for quality society.  but the things listed during the solution phase, i dont agree with everything necessarily, this is a new time opening up with the internet allowing so much more into human eyes, so many differences emerging from tech success, etc.
That’s True Art
FedEx help!!!! 1 yr ago
Stunningly magnificent
Who all see him similar like Thomas Shelby from peaky Blinders
Goddamn dude who hurt you?  Also, impressive production
Ren Magritte 🤍🤍🤍✨🔥🔥🔥
THIS IS ART

https://youtu.be/Q6N8jL8TCiM?si=12CnBXZHalTcMyTf ORIGINAL SERBIAN SONG, this shit is just bad copy. Thank you 😉💪🏼 we are some bold people, and this is really hard song. In our rap-trap culture, and this song is out, after war.
Sensational

Ooooohhhh myyyy GOOOOOD! MASTERPIECE! I put my hat down! Applause! Leaving a comment for the algorithm. This is inscredible.
Ren just wrote a song about a full movie with this one and I love it
he is a gift for humanity.
Power to the End!!❤
To be alive in a generation where Ren exists 🤩❤ amazing!!
Please do a collab with Mezerg
Everything is subject to change. I will be behind you willing to die for the cause when the time comes and all the lights go out and all these people who look down on us now will be relying on us to survive. And we will help them. Even though they never helped us.
EVERYTHING IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE!!!!!
Brilliant!
I wish you could come to haven for hope ... It would help so many .. San Antonio Texas .. please Ren
...brilliant. Hun....tNtR.....
I don’t have a word to say. It’s the truth and masterpiece!
So much respect ❤ from Egypt
Everything you do is amazing, please keep playing. So talented.
Amazing talent so powerful. Always evokes deep emotions
Amazing!!! 🌋🌋🌋
So deep..Amazing Work
everything is corrupted,just lost my driving license and job cause i wouldn't grovel to them and bow down to their sick rules
Absolute chills, wow. Incredible
Can't believe I missed this a year ago
Absolutamente maravilloso
rate u bro has a deep rapper myself ❤
masterpiece
I found your music through a meme, and now I unironically listen to all 3 money game songs a lot. They’re so good. They sound good, have a good message and are like theatre perfomances
And this beautiful masterpiece is followed on my screan by a commercial spot, how to trade and make more money... Bizar coïncedence.... Think of Nina Simones...I got life!
Beautiful work
This lad is in a different galaxy. Pure amazingly talented. Best for decades. Power to you Ren. 😊
Ren, It's been so long since the world has seen such a raw, beautiful and deep representation of truth. Honestly, man, I'm getting goosebumps each time I listen to your art. Thank you. Just...thank you.
Honestly, we need more music like this Maybe then more people will change and retaliate against “them”
2025 just found! 😮
Simplistic dumb university politics. Love your work but grow up a bit
😯
THIS is Tàlent
since when does Thomas Shelby makes music
this song is beautifully crafted and has a powerful and transcendent message to everyone. A true masterpiece all on its own!   ... also gotta point out that (maybe just coincidental timing), but it feels to me kinda like another clever sneak diss at Drake aka. Jimmy in the wheelchair lol (excluding the whole brilliant mind and childhood part)
Im late but I'm here. Would also like to come back time and again so 👇 hit that. 🫡

Hi Ren!   I doubt you’ll ever read this comment in particular but I have to tell you that your music makes me “feel” more than anything else I have ever listened to.   Your stuff is impactful in a way that nothing else I have come across is. Keep it up man, you’re really making a small positive impact to millions of people.   That’s change the world stuff.
Crazy Ren Asylum Vibe getting old. Anything cool coming out soon that's musical in nature?
Masterpiece
Ren is incredible
Fuuuuuck. When I watch this after I have seen 2 or 3 hours of BTS that Wolf did.... Fucking top notch.  Everyone, from Ren all the way down to the little extrawith the train.  Amazeballs man, excellent.  I had no idea what went into all of this before, and now I can't stop wondering about all the other videos and what went on BTS. I'm a friggin Ren junkie, but I didn't want to be this way. This is not me, this is not my life. And yet someone sucked me into this shit. Thank you, Ren, from the depths of my heart. You're a bad mofo, even if you wanna stay modest. Much love.
Holy shit. Holy shit..... holy.... shit. ❤❤❤
Thank God...something original and cool
это. просто. ахуенно.  лучший клип который я видел
That moved me more than most movies will never comprehend 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Oh! It's Tony Stark
:o Oh wow...
He is just insane good
8:30  well, I may be wrong, but at this point I got reminded of the chorus of parts 1 and 2, so was that meant to be  rain rain rain rain a storm it comes our way, if it was then I don't know what to say, it's genius
What a masterpiece this song is ❤
Funny thing is that he tells his cameraman exactly how to move,where to move,when to move Real masterpiece ❤
Sooooo fucking good !!!❤
Good Ren breaks free finally. He's back. Or is he?

Love this guy.... Nothing like music that tells the story that's how it's supposed to be.   ...
I just love it

Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy One years old and his first words were mine, mine gimme Two years old, he was walking, three years old, walking quickly Four years old, he was running around the pavements of his city Five years old, and his daddy told him, listen here son, you've got to learn to be a man A man he works for what he wants Six years old, and he's reading, writing, top of the bunch And when he's seven, his progression made him student number one Eight years old and he's praised for unusual grades Nine, his parents pay for private school to nurture the flame 10, 11, 12, 13, he ascends and ascends, his daddy tells him, son, money is the means to all ends 14 solving complex mathematic equations, at 15, IQ 150, still elevating 16 he develops complex software code that detects weaknesses in cyber security protocol 17, and he sells his vision, keeping the share, not yet an adult But he's practically a millionaire 18, and his daddy tells him now you're a man the world don't give a damn about you So take all that you can 19, he turns a profit, stocks and shares, invest in product 20, double down deposits 21, his income rockets 22, he learns that truth is just an obstacle to wealth If you manipulate the data, then the lie will sell itself 23, a life of luxury Crystal and cocaine 24, he makes the Forbes list, they're applauding his name 25, and his daddy told him, listen here, son, while you're sitting in the palace That don't mean that you won 26, his business shifts, he switches business to arms He's 27, dealing nuclear shells in Iran 28, inside the Senate, money bought him a seat He's 29, role of counsel in the president suite And now he's 30, his daddy says, you're losing the race You're just a servant to the king, not even in second place 31, a big maneuver for his daddy's approval Moving imports over borders from the exports out of Cuba 32, moving grams, growing kilo to tons He's 33, filling warehouses with powder and guns 34, turf war with nobody to stop it, blind eye from the Po po inside of his pocket 35, he gets a call, I'm sorry, son, but it's your father, had a heart attack I'm sorry, he's gone, 36, getting pissed off abusing this product 37, eyes glazed, disposition demonic 38, with a prostitute, a moment of passion Heating up the silver spoon and then chasing the dragon 39, getting reckless and hungry for power Daddy's words still driving him to kill him and devour He makes a move against the cartel, but the strategy's flawed They retaliate and leave him in the hospital ward A bullet buried in his vertebra, and one in his leg The doctor sighs and says, I don't think you'll be walking again, fuck Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy He was 40 and he cursed the words mine, mine gimme 41, he wasn't walking, 42, not walking quickly, 43 Never running round the pavements of his city 44 inside a palace with a mountain of gold But those riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves Weighing heavy on his conscience is the value of gold, Lamborghini for a life Trading money for souls, Jimmy followed the code inside the land of the free Put your hand inside the cookie jar, take more than you need And his example is exaggerated versions of me, and it's a version of him And it's a version of she, and it's a version of you There's no escaping the blame, the way we live, it's parasitic Fuck the money and fame, cut the music This isn't entertainment, this is real life, the way we live is lunacy, community it declines We're hyperpolarized, we're always fighting and we divide Truth is less important than the money that we designed? Money's an invention, politics from our invention, they all come from people's ideas Did I mention, border's an invention Law and order fuels the tension that leads to people killing each other My solution? Everything is subject to change We could build utopias if individuals were taught to use their brains But if we teach kids in schools to always be sheep and put themselves before the herd If there's more money for meat Then there's no future I see where the humans survive We're parasites inside the Petri dish, with cannibal mines Mold will grow upon the surface, then consumes 'til it dies And our fate could be the same without this story to the wise 45, Jimmy comes home out of the rain, soaking wet upon a wheelchair Drinking again, he has everything he wants, he has fortune and fame Such a fortunate fool with an unfortunate fate with a 45 caliber aimed at his brain 45, a fitting number because his age is the same Here's the words of his father, it's such a damn shame Then he presses on the trigger of a money game
Woah
This song reminds me of the trickster from flash cw
Young Thomas Shelby lol. Real shit though, you're great at what you do, please keep doing it awesome brother!
i saw the thumbnail and immediately thought of the library babel very high quality video!!
Depuis 2 ans je t'écoute un peu par si et un peu part laba je trouve intéressant ta manière de t'exprimer ton timbre de vois me plaît une raclure d3s cordes et un sentiment de plenitude sourde continue à être autodidacte et ne suit rien, juste l'amour
love the "mine mine gimme" line, epitomises babies so succintly
Thats the sherriff sitting there but ren said this is not ren number 2 and the sherriff isn't as good looking as ren no one wants to look at the sherrif marshall and ren  shhh marahall might be haunting as jack white I reminded him mentally I think on paoer about jack white pharoah lyrics
Ren is so magical .
Shit ren missed ren the vertical brie is cheese hm profe fire lessons song hm ren rap god hm d12 my band hm Jimmy rottennir Jimmy urine or Jimmy pop or Jimmy there and there
The best boys have haircuts like ren kiddo! And its one of thise viking haircuts dont you also like thst avatar metal band you clown!
Rens got thst sharp haircut everyone wants a haircut like ren
I don't know if I interpreted correctly, but if I understood correctly, the moment that you took off this mask covering yourself, Ren, was the moment that you realized that you were part of the system. Then you start narrating the story about this person, doing it in the third person as if you were omnicient about the situation. You're the only one in the room who doesn't have the mask on, so in a sense, it means that you open your eyes to the difficulties of the world and embrace them, as some people would put the mask back on and forget what they saw.   Please correct me if I am wrong!!  PS: I love your music/storytelling, the way you express yourself. I hope your music will help many other people.
Gives me such Hamilton vibes but in a much rawer fashion.  Incredible stuff as per from the maverick himself, Ren!
Ts so bad
Extraordinary. Never have I come across and artist and binge his entire collection.
That .. was something...
Its kill me so hard maaann
This man has something to say that's worth listening to
Thought I was listening to Shane Koyczan for a minute till I realize its Ren... Such Is Life; what a wonderful story 😊
youtube should work overtime to push his songs...
Capitalism killed humanity.
Another masterpiece from Ren
I can't do it my CPTSD go off like crazy....due to someone who hung themselves that I knew.
O
45 a fitting number...thinking a lot about this song today
friends game
Luigi taught me democracy
Once upon a time, long ago, Lived a boy, his name was Samm, yo. Samm was cool, never all alone, But the problem was – he spammed on his own. Troubled, he thought – man, I’m hooked on spam, Next day he’s standing at the clinic’s damn. Blasted out, wired, high to the skies, Couldn’t care less for doctors, joint in his hands, red eyes.  But it didn’t last long, the hit was too fast, The gram hit the grass, his legs turned to glass. Hard like a rock, not made of sugar, No crooked lines could hold his figure. In the Dirty South, his soul caught a flame, Blown out Samm, lost inside the game.  That’s everyday life, from the moment he wakes, On the Dirty South side, reality breaks. Mood don’t matter, depressed or high, “Doctor, hey Doctor, am I losing my mind?” But Doc can’t help, nothing he can say, Little Samm’s soul is drifting away.  Fucked up again, speed hits his brain, Flying too high, lost in the lane. Day after day, the cycle repeats, Running full throttle, can’t feel his feet. This is the Dirty South, his only place, his only sky, That’s where Samm lives... and his endless high.
Holy F$c% this is so brilliant!
wow and goosebumps
This is TRUE art, thank you Ren. You're a genius.
This was absolutely true and a real piece of art!
This track hits way too hard 😮
I have no words to describe how perfect this video, connection,  lyrics are to me.. I literally can't not listen to it multiple times a day. ..thank God for my amazing husband of 14 years that introduced me to this ren and many artists.. love you babe!!❤
Just one thing, Who has been fed up with those we once thought tolerant to. More than Half the original population of most these countries who have accepted immigrants. Not all you call immigrants are immigrants.They are what made countries out of tribes, villages or something that didn’t survive to today. Fucking naive  bullshit to say United States was built on the people who were here first or those who intruded lately.
Keep coming back to this. Brilliant song and video. Would you consider a colab with RTJ? Think you could make a banger
Genius!
This is not just a song. It's a true work of art. From the very first note, it captures your attention and refuses to let go. The voice carries both fragility and strength, guiding us through a story that feels deeply intimate yet universally relatable. The single-take video? A cinematic masterpiece in itself, raw and unfiltered, where every movement of the camera feels intentional and alive. Listening to it feels like holding onto someone who exists halfway between reality and memory. Close, yet unreachable. Few songs manage to blend music and visual storytelling on this level. This is just haunting, beautiful and timeless. A masterpiece in every sense.
If EM is the Elvis of the game, then REN is our Prince. Something completely artistic.
Hopefully karma exists ❤
Have watched and listened to this video perhaps dozens of times. What I just noticed is that Ren is replaced by another piano player. When one leaves, another takes his place to continue the song or story. The “Money Game” is cyclical. As we are in human history, this endeavor will never stop.
Warum ist er nicht bekannter?  So wahr, so echt!
I just found you and your work Ren...you're incredible, so much pure talent on so many levels! Very impressive work telling the life stories as you do through music and visually. 💙
I'm amazed. Something that made me sit up asnd listen. Salem,my cat agrees
Leaving a comment, when someone like so i could also watch
I've also quit drinking.
Music changes people lives, we choose what we listen, for our falls or thrives. Some music makes us better, some worse. Make your choice a blessing, not a curse.
Brilliant!
It's not garbage. Ren is clearly a talent. Dark is your message, Ren. Dark angel material, certainly. I walk away. It obvious you haven't a clue that your production of it can destroy the peace many struggle to build inside themselves. I appreciate your gift Ren. Thank you for inspiring in ways uncommonly bleak and miserable. Proof your performance is powerful. But, not my cup of tea. Bloody dark. I dont need to feel it. I know, "it". Not to cast dispersions or ill will. If, and i sincerely couldn't know, but if all of your storied musical productions are based in fiction, I mean what a relief. If not, well um, sorry mate. Better life will come of it. Im sure. You're on your way.
Message received. Intense rhetorical reality. Rehashing manic uncontrolled behavior for shock value gets through to peoples heart strings. I haven't been this close to heart attack since watching the passion. BTW, I love your voice, Ren
This guy is dark. I get it. Super talented. Smart. My question? Ren. Are you a baller?

Masterpiece idd
All those fuckng manipulation truth combine just in one fricking room..  man..
00:01:00 That melody was soooo good, I almost wish it hadn't ended.  Or is there a full version somewhere?
😮
all that for him to shoot a blank
Tarrintino needs to put Ren in one of his films.
THIS IS TIMELESS & FUCKING BRILLIANT!
Elon is that you son?
I’ve been listening to this song at least once a day for a year now (sometimes more than I’d like to admit, lol). Still can’t get over how good it is. Ren, please never stop making music. I found your music and I RESPECT it!
This is a good song
Oh my Gosh!! Goosebumps
Wow🔥🔥🔥
the best music video so far
Hello you all i was stupid and I forgot Rens name so I just wrote to YouTube English prodigy musician and now I found him back ❤ wow I knew that I can still find him ❤❤ great musician indeed 🤘😇🤘
I think this is tha best description of our cooked world right now😢
As a Humanities and Social Science Student, this song hurts so much because of how truthful it is
Masterpiece!!! 👍🙌🎶💪
this is cinema
I have lived this life….now 65 years old and things change and none of us can control these changes and always in the end everybody dies and there are no pockets in a shroud…🤔❤👍
So talented what can't you sing
Wow just wow
Bro might be joker in real life
How this person isn’t more famous?
Okay, Tommy Shelby! OML!
Thats a full daym masterpiece
get nore comments because this needs global attention
I've lost count of how many times I've watched this. It's perfection
This is up there with Shakespeare, with the great poets, with the finest wordsmiths of all. It’s pure art.
Amazing 👏

Wow no words can describe my feelings now. Thank you
Soo good

❤
This is a great movie plot!
Ren, every video you create resonates deeply with me. At nearly 60 years old, I've spent a lifetime questioning and challenging the institutions of religion, finance, and politics. For most of that time, it felt as though I was shouting into a void—my convictions unheard and unshared. Then I discovered your work, and it was as if someone had finally given voice to everything I’ve believed for decades. Please keep doing what you do. Your courage and clarity are a gift to many of us. Bravo, dear boy.
damn, you're talented!
Love the music but I feel that the part with the violins when he is talking about him walking speed walking and running I think he should have did it in reverse order but like I said love the music
This has to be among the top of any music videos charts
The lyrics are good but the video is pure Tarantino art.
Amazing story
If I could describe Ren in one word: Apocalyptic. His level of talent, intelligence, sophistication, sincerity and passion is unprecedented. He's not an artist, he's a revolution. I'm a 50 year old indie whatever...thought I'd heard it all...I never imagined I'd discover anything close to what we're all so excited to behold and experience unfold in the present. Thank you SO much Ren. You make music ... Yes ... But... You also made history.
Love you
powder and guns, love it c..t🎉
LOVE THIS GUY
is it wrong that I've got this full volume? so loud my windows are shaking lmao
I like to think in money game 3 Ren isn't just talking about well the "money game" but I think it's also a cautionary tale about what a life with no love does to someone. We hear nothing about Jimmy's mother, so I'm gonna assume she wasn't in his life or Jimmy ignored her, also I wouldn't put his father past being abusive to her and trying to separate Jimmy and his mom. While Jimmy's father may have loved him it was definitely a "tough love" dynamic. So that's like no unconditional love from his parents. Jimmy's father lead him down a path devoid of love even in his school years, we here nothing about him dating other people, likely because either he was scared of what his father would think, he was too focused on his studies or his father forbid it. Even in later life Jimmy never found love, there's this whole part with the prostitute, so chances are he never even had a wife. Lastly we don't hear of any friends Jimmy had so there's not even that platonic love in his life. It's a well crafted tragedy and I love it!  Edit: one thing I thought about is maybe the success and pressure from his father made Jimmy see himself as above love. Yet also I think Jimmy hasn't lived a life without love more or so I think he lived a life with CONDITIONAL love from his father, which heavily messed him up, in his last moment he hears his own father say he's a shame which no man should ever say to a child. Yet Jimmy 100% loved his father I just think the conditional love messed him up. Or I'm distracting from the main reason, I dunno :)
I absolutely love the piano in the background especially during '21, his income rockets'
wow...
Ya singing about ya self Ren , I'm sure of it . Wish I could shake ya hand regardless , amazing music man . Hi from New Zealand . Love your acoustic guitar playing .
Artist of the Year!!!
Masterpiece
Wow I finally...I find a true ARTIST...and a true message...it exudes honesty
🙏
Ren and Eminem in the future would be amazing.
This is so brillant. I love your Storys and i love your Songs.  Ren is a musical genius. ❤❤
Your music has been there through some rough times, thank you for sharing all you do with us all.
Fucking brilliant! Bravo !!!! 👏👏

😮😮😮👏👏👏
I seen you viral on IG today. Thank you for this 1 ❤
Damn,  life operas. Love this poetry. ❤
NGL... this made me cry a LOT. not cause I have a bad relationship with my parents but because of the message as a whole and the storytelling. at some point, the music (which sounds awesome) became secondary to the actual lyrics and what was happening. Too much talent, keep smashing it man!
What a MasterPiece! I dont know why this hasn't a billion view.
I don’t have the words, thanks to my sister's to have sheared with me this masterpiece !!! 🙏🏼❤️🔥🔥
Is he dead?
❤ 0:19
Fugging unbelievable 🙌🏻 be you ren
Holy shit he looks like Tommy Shelby😭😭🔥🔥🔥
Omg 😮
You are not from this planet bro  One love ❤
I came after watching reels. It fucking amazing lyrics connecting to real life
Absolute masterpiece fucking geniuse
Thank you from Turkey. Thank you for saying the words we all want to say and need to hear.
Without any doubt, a masterpiece that will age like fine wine
This talent right here cant be bought, sold or stolen.. its a natural gift that very few have!   The lyrics, the piano, the video are the ingredients of a beautiful truthful masterpiece of how it is when ppl choose greed over truth! The biggest respect to you Ren 🫡❤
Ren music still the best
I’m truly delighted that I had the chance to see this masterpiece.
Sound horeg is good
it's a very important message. this is not musical is an art
This man is something else. Wow.
Every part of this was perfection. Story, videography, rhymes, set, all of it.
One of the most incredible music videos and song.
Holy fuck that shit was, unbelievable
this is a fuckin masterpiece
Powerful ❤❤💯🔥
This guy is a Briana musician and wordsmith and songwriter. At first I was put off by his intensity but his words made sense to me. More people should take the time to stop, breathe and think about Ren’s message.
This man is awesome
cringe
This is art depicting the cycle of the system of things Institutional Greed. The very imp that perverses mankind. As long as it's institutionalized, the man's doomed to bring out the worst in them. Life's absurd when we will it to be.
Simply a piece of art!
Ticking the oe ivorys
Damn! So good
Oneofthemostthoughtinducingartistsindecades
Wow.. that was amazing 😮😮😮😮😮❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
Heard "Jimmy" and thought this was about to be about Mr. Beast
Putain de super artiste !!!  Merci a poto de boulot de m'avoir fait tellement connaître 🤕💯🤒🤒🤕🤕😋😋😋🥰
Watch again! Lol
This is so true and everything like what if humans can use their brains and gifts correctly than destroying what if we can create things no one ever thought what if there a way etc
While I apparently love ALL of Ren's music.. the way the keyboard dances across my headphones in this makes my brain very happy.  Dunno why.  Also love the hell or of the story,  but I always do.
This missed the mark for me. Getting into politics was the last thing I expected from him. Lots of things are inventions, so? Family is too, parenthood, marriage, funerals, respect, honor, love. But borders thats a no no? Then open your door. You got the money now, so do it. Open your door to randos on the street.  The more I think about this, the more it gets to me. Of course, you're from the UK, and there is only one way you would have risen to the top. All I see now, a govt psyop
This beginning reminds me of fredd murcury  , I know where all dieing for a miracle,  not like nightmares with night mare on elm fkn street,  yes I'm I'm lit  , free  styln this fuck shit but I  to gkn go b4 the booze store fuckn cloze
C’est exactement ce que je pense de l’humanité! Je me sens moins seule grâce à cette œuvre magnifique. Des paroles tranchantes qui me trotte dans la tête depuis des années et qui pour moi,  d’une part… la triste réalité. Merci à toi Ren d’exister 💚☮️😌
🔥 bro
Imagine if the people who need to hear this did.
The first piano intro sounds a lot like Grieg: Piano concerto in A Minor. Reference or not it sounds so beautiful
Damn I somehow missed this one for awhile
Leaving a comment for the algorithm
I just found out about REN a few days ago. A day when I really needed to hear the words he was speaking. Thank you for sharing your story with us, I know for sure that you will help many struggling people get better. God bless you and all the best.
By far the best artist for time love this guy
Intelligent  and sincere.These are the traights of you that cause pain in your mental health  Ren ❤
This song has the same cadence as Cleaning Out My Closet…Please tell me y’all can hear it
This trilogy is the musical equivalent of the Lord of the rings
Thank you Ren for truly showing how the world..Trump is.
Using intuition to execute a vision, it’s almost hysterical. the same ideas the same realizations maybe one day some generation will save us but until that day comes, which likely never will, we’ll all be stuck in a perpetual loop of bad luck, I don’t know about you, but I don’t think waiting is gonna help anymore
This guy is brilliant! I'm an old woman with wayyy more salt than pepper in my hair. I am so glad something from Ren popped into my feed a couple of weeks ago. Been obsessed ever since.
Man the effort❤
New favourite artist discovered
omg as im listen it litterly sounds so like the snowfall plot and now i cant un hear it
I m here....and see cinema, musical, theater, psicology....life.....and ....the sensation....too complex....but I like
Consider this a comment.
Hand's up ❤to you
Whatch it guys it's great
ABSOLUTE CINEMA
kurwa mocne
Damn.
It would be really cool to see you make a James Bond theme song...your voice has the power and grief it needs.
I need a Peaky Blinders spinoff with Ren as Tommys son
If only people would take some of these lyrics seriously. He said it himself it is not lyrics to a song. It’s reality. Wealth and power have become the god we worship. Things will need to change before we lead the whole human race into ruin. We’ve dug ourselves pretty deep and we are going to need some serious tools to climb out.
ren: my solushion  camara: looks at gun me: oh.. oh no
Just came across this video and Artist, Wow.. Genius!! Masterpiece!! THANK YOU REN.
This is very representative of my feelings and mood right now. Just got into an argument with my dad because he wants me to "play the game" to get promotions and I'm unwilling to give up my principles and act like someone I'm not to do it. Cause it's all worthless to me if I hate myself for it
You lnow what...im going to stop having expectations for you cause each time I say my expectations are getting higher come to find out once again you greatily exceed my expectation.  If you didnt catch that...i am having unrealistic versions of expectations. Im not going to tell you anymore...but i have a strong feeling every video i watch of yours will make time stand still around me. Of all the artists, bands ive seen or heard. Brother ren has made a very emotionally, raw, dark, sad form of music with skits that blend ao beautifully togetherness...if was a recorded producer or owned record lable. THERES NO FUCKING WAY ID EVEN CONSIDER TAKING YOU IN...cause id NEVER WANT TO TAKE WHAT YOU HAVE MADE SO BEAUTIFULLY AND COLLAR YOU UP AND TELL YOU GO MAKE ME MONEY. NEVER TURN THIS PASSION OF YOURS TO AN EVERY GROWING MONEY FACTOR. cause a bird like ren should NEVER be caged for other greed. IM NO PSYCHIC BUT I SEE YOUR FUTURE, YOU WILL BE LOADED WITH, AN ICON WHO EVERYBODY SEEMS TO LOVE JUDGING BY THE COMENTS SECTION. I have been watching your vids monstop today and just today i discovered you. Please dont ever stop what you are going...and PLEASE DONT LET THE MONEY TURN YOUR PASION INTO A JOB. Cause then the passion will die. I am rooting for you in every fuckin way ren, and today my first day herong anytbing by ylu amd i am FUCKIN HOOKED
Another ren story with song. This one looks a little different thoug, as as before when i watched screech n jenny my standrds are for you are...NOW ASTRONOMICAL. I look foward to another raw peice by this british man ren.
I would kill to watch this for the first time again
😮Thank you JD! You are the one who reminded us that We can save ourselves today! Ren's Music inspired you. That Last Song is A Masterpiece! 💯🔥👏👏❤️
Comment
4:35 ayo dont pickup the phone this time. Dr 𝄢 -agent ukulele
This Ren guy is a genius and everything he has ever sang has been literally true!❤wow
I'm here because of Chris Webby. I just wanted to say I love your art. It is the most original. I don't think there's anybody that combines hip hop, poetry, the art of the bard, cinematography, hell, even philosophy in a way so perfect as you do. Your art pierces into my soul whether I want it to or not, regardless of my mood, and it's strange to me because no other art has ever done that to me. My life experience will be significantly better because of you as well as my personal growth and being able to connect my ideas, values, and emotions. Sorry if that's corny but I hope that you can see that you're doing some good for the world.
1:25 Really glad that bro realized that wearing a necktie and a noose is redundant.  Kinda like wearing a hat on a hat!  Great song, great story, and great video!
TEN your awesome ❤❤❤
Wow! This lad is a fuckin genius man! The music world needs to give Ren the respect & coverage he deserves. Rhymes about the world in all it's ugly glory with no sugarcoating. Spread his truth 🙏
Karma will always catch you
15 years ago I discovered Bob Dylan and today I discovered Ren
einer der besten künstler unsere zeit ;:)
This stuff is far outside the cultural industry garbage
"Then he presses on the trigger of money game" woaoh
Deaf fan here. Thanks for subtitling. The best story videoclip I watched so far. You're a genius, genius, genius!
Damn thats not the ending I was expecting
1:40 the way he is vocalizing sounds haunting setting the stage for the story.
❤🔥🔥🔥
Put me in the game coach 3///
Reminds me of flobots - handlebars
I’ve never seen anything like this
just... GOD DAMN!  Art is back y'all!
Just leaving this one for the algorithm 🎉
Dead as a button
F the money and fame
I’ve watched this a hundred times. It’s still extraordinary.
Such a great song like this so I can listen to it again
really powerful
CLIX!
The camera work is incredible, adds, frames and pushes the storyline on. So Richard doesn't have a great first day back at work. He's a magnet for tragedy and violence and Vincent is a lost soul looking for an end but death by cop wasn't his end that night as Screech's death made Richard a different man
For what shall it profit a man if he gains the world but loses his soul.
This is a masterpiece. This dude is about to blow up internationally.
Great job Ren , always a cinematic masterpiece
Holy shit
omg
So powerful!
Top artist of this decade love you ren
Holy daaamnnn!!!!!
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🤔
This is an absolute masterpiece
Why Ren doesn't have Grammy ? Why he is not at the top of charts? Because the truth hurts... And the real masters behind the scene does not want the herd to know the truth.... Ren, you are like some modern kind of prophet and bard of the reality... And that's why the big musical business will never accept you - you hurt theirs dream factory...
Oh my goodness you are incredible, when you have bpd and autism etc its horrible, i would love a message back aha eminem is awesome its all poetry
He is amazing this a masterpiece genius
what a MASTERPIECE ..wooowww
heyyyy
The truth will outlive any lie. Money has no value other than what we assign it.
I ate chip show show
❤.
If this doesn't make you open your eyes and feel something, then you're already dead. 🎯🔥💯 This is everything. There is so much that needs to be unlearned by so many. Thank you for this masterpiece. 👏👏
Great song brotha
Tommy Shelby if he was a musician.. Tell me I’m wrong..
My brother shared REN with me, Money Game Pt 1, Pt 2, then more... Now he's gone and I wish we could have shared this masterpiece.
MASTERPIECE
Serves no purpose without the truth in Christ.   And there it is 🙏
Absolutely Brilliant
Damn I’m moved. Story telling lyricist with some shit people can relate too. Don’t ever stop expressing. Thank you

The camera work is outstanding, one long shot playing a lot with the frame, no room for mistakes.
Perfect lyrics and cinematography 🤜🏻🤌🏻✌🏻❤️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Ren is a seriously amazing and talented artist! I love the direction of the film and how well done the instrumental part is. It's such a masterpiece
Beauty in melody, with flibbertigibbet combined creates a symphony of the greatest madness in life! Collaboration with @yungblud or @machinegunkelly!
We love you Ren
einfach brutal
Youtube won't allow me to make certain negative comments about the subject matter of this song. Deletes them.  Looks like tyranny to me.   Who's the dictator at YouTube? .

Парень талант,он за 5 минут объяснил весь принцип капитализма❤❤❤
Ren, you broke the fifth wall. And you ain’t done yet.
Did Beck have a child with Eminem that I dont know about?
Ren will sellout crowds if he went on tour big time 😊
Way way talented dude...Going Places!!!!!!!
I just found about Ren I have been non stop listening and watching his artwork. It reaches.
Unbelievable
So happy and grateful I went down this rabbit hole. So much talent!!! ❤❤❤❤
Money.. Money is just a token of debt. A number that shows how much ressources the printing country ows you, and how much of it's services and resources you can claim.  And since a country consist of people those people are in debt to those with money.  It's debt and interest that is the real problem.  That people basicly can be in debt to other people wether it is in money or services makes them slaves.  If humans gave gifts insted of a loans noone could hoard other peoples debt.
Wasn't the song faster? Is this a new version? What happened to the old one?
I know Ren or anybody probably won't read this, but I'm 17. Been listening to Ren's music for a while, and thought I had truly understood it till recently. After being pushed out from my home town with my mother and 2 brothers, due to gentrification in a mostly black and Hispanic neighborhood. After we all had been celebrating the new Starbucks, McDonald's, the new family dollar, the newly fixed streets. Our home town looked good again just for them to turn around and start raising rent knowing most of the people they rented to were working class and on welfare just to feed their family's. We moved to Florida still can't afford a home, make too much to considered poor enough to help, make too little for any landlord to feel like we have the stability for them to rent to us. Having to watch my mother cry and struggle for money, my grandfather dying due to an avoidable infection after watching his nurses mistreat him first hand after helping himself myself for years. Being diagnosed with autism and going to therapy while my family wants me to get a job, but all these jobs are crying for experience I don't have due to age and won't even give me a second glance whether it be because the autism, inexperience, or race. It makes me feel sick cause I know none of this is fucking needed, it feels like I'm watching from the outside as wolves tear at each other bit by bit and leave the bones for the rest. I know it's unnecessary to write this in a YouTube comment section but listening to this trilogy in my playlist after a year of not hearing it made me cry and made me stop to think.  Cause I know I'm no better cause sometimes I feel like money would solve all our problems, but I know it wouldn't.
Deep and real. Thumbs up for going real deep.
Ima fan but at 06:40 after "cut the music" they shoulda play 1-1,5 bar more to give a more realistic feeling instead of a script.
Ren is an artist's artist. A true inspiration.
Holy hells this is impactful! What a masterpiece of storytelling and cinematography!
TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS FOR MY NEXT WORK - VINCENT'S TALE -  HERE AND JOIN ME FOR THE PREMIER https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-myXdYvu3w
Hey ren, I don’t know if you read these comments or not, but I came across a guy, Mike tellinger, who has been working on a better system for years. It’s called the “one small town” project. Might be worth taking a peek if nothing else 🤷‍♂️ I came across him watching archaeology videos, but he might have the solution.
❤
The vibe is honest and true. Wish more people would open  their eyes. I have known this since i was a child.🎉❤
This is a musical masterpiece. The piano score is incredible.
The average age for someone convicted of a serious crime in UK is 34.I wonder if he chose that for that reason
Checkmate. Thank you.
Did you know that they did all of this in one continuous scene & they had to do it the first time because the suit was custom & the water ruined the suit
just found your videos and my chatgpt recommendation did not disappoint.
Love Tommy, Rennes likes Ren a lot !
Money is invention
Does this make anyone else think of tRump…red tie…truth is less important than…45 a fitting number…as tRump was 45th president at the time this came out…maybe it’s just me because I can’t stand tRump…
Well, too bad I cannot put a thumb up each time  I listen to this masterpiece.🙏❤️✨
Insane talent
damn. DAMN. FUCK.
Jimmy is no more

Perfect. No more, no less.
Sharingan killer they call me naruto
Just wanted you  to know that saved my live brother took me down off the noos a couple times ❤️
At the end there is no bullet, right? Que didn't kill himself!? Russian Roulette?
So fucking talented, your story telling, music and film (Awesome Sam👍) is just phenomenal.  Just pure art .... I can't imagine the amount of dedication it takes to get a one-take video! ... You Ren, and crew are amazing!!!  A two hour million dollar blockbuster could not compete with this and it's under ten minutes!!!
Absolutely brilliant 👌👌👌
What makes this a masterpiece, is that every word is the truth. Every word of this song is based on facts. I feel that we’re all doomed because we just consume with no end.
Ren👏🏼in👏🏼a👏🏼suit👏🏼😍😍😍😍
This trilogy is incredible... Ren you are the voice of truth of this society's mistakes.
Ren is a genius with the pen nd the pad truly story telling 😮🎉❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Incredible.
how did the other 2 become this lmao
This is called art. You have real talent ❤.
Fuck me, this was something special.

Sharingan killer they call me naruto
Hi Ren
Is it me or does he look like the actor that played Thomas Shelby from peaky blinders
Genius personified
Amazing!!!
0:46 do not focus too intently on this part if you're super stoned. You have been warned.
This is just WOW! What an incredible performance by both Ren & Sam, a masterpiece for the mind & soul.
Fantastic idealistic true performance adored by woman pushing 80, Ren is keeping it real.
So hot
MAD SKILLS!!!  I got you FAM!!
...С рождения Бобби пай мальчиком был, имел Бобби хобби - он деньги копил...
Holy hand granades….
HOLY S*** !!!!! Everything I'm feeling expressed in the MOST INCREDIBLE WAY! You're such a STORYTELLER. Exquisite.
Ren reminds me of NF, both their story telling, film making, message, etc
This is a beautiful followup to 2 already really good songs in their right. Legendary.
i won the game and i’m so proud of what i’ve been able to accomplish and i pray that i get the opportunity and recognition to make others feel better about themselves i also pray to be able to help them through any obstacles they may be facing so please god give me the chance to do what you no i  made to do i am that force i am that strong i am not weak and i am fucking someone that can do anything that’s pushed my way and into my life , i’ve not given up i won’t give up and i will succeed and i will make others lives so much better
I’m 10 years old I am lucky because I know the real world at such a young age and I don’t turn into a mindless zombie who only wants money and It’s not the best money it just stops us from caring and I don’t care about the dang money I agree with you
Every lyric from ren brings raw emotion
My problem is, I've waited way too long for the act to evolve. #whereisstimpy
Just try to feel
Keep going beyond the noise my friend minds must break the hearts will shake Ten steps in make it are  brake it take it back your time.... Take it back your will
Ok part 4 about vanguard, state street and black rock
Ren is the true GOAT!!!❤️❤️❤️
You have a unique and amazing talent, I love how and what your doing.
DAMN Ren in a suit!
I've been following you since your first music on small platforms. Me and @Mikael Divan Davidsson, both pronmusicisns from Halmstad would love to get you to Sweden. I know Jenny at Sony, and old friend of mine. We brouth Biffy Clyro here. ❤️❤️❤️
Comment to rewatch. Pls like.
Speechless, what a Masterpiece!
Wow. I was left speechless
Well done, well said.
👍
If I listen to it enough, will it make a difference?? if not, doesn’t matter I’m still gonna listen.
We all are living in someone else shadow
This world is fake USA is just a mixing bowl ment to be mixed and sold we are the product not what we buy and sell wake up look who really rules not the political clowns. Open your eye
Yes
So beautiful, I will never get tired of this, even if the only part that spoke to me was "what is wrong with everyone taking cookies they can't even eat? Cookies are finite. Top of the bunch my ass, student number one should understand basic economics."   Of course all of it is poignant and incredible so that helps too.
this song changed my perspective.. in a good way. ren you may never see this, but you changed my life and your fans have lifted my world. thank you. thank you for letting react to and feel your music
Brilliant!
You are absolutely my favourite singer
Holy fuck I really hope this is heard  ...  I've been wounded and left for dead.  I've got truth that is ignored and this song is all about why
❤❤
Nice very nice
Only bad thing I can say is it sucks I’m just now learning of him (within the last couple of months) and his music…I know many have said this but he is a very talented artist and learning of all he had to go through…just amazing!!! All the hard work he’s put into his art and his health…
Algorithms and data bases and the ones behind them are the true problem most of the time some of it
❤❤❤
Deadwood Jimmy Approved.
S"it hey!?!
Money come from negative to solve the problem like what? To act like a positive 🤡🤘
d:ryu
omg man you are so talented we need more of you ...... beautiful raw and intelligent
Comment so I freak out

... whoa
Really wtf what does your love look like i missed my birthday now you have to make it up to me
Amazing
A piece of art ❤
10/10
this is sad because it real
You are redefining what a song can be. Interesting. I don't know if the world is ready for you yet, but what do I know. I could be wrong. I enjoyed your song, anyway.
ren estoy obsesionado con tu musica te admiro espero que te valla bien donde quiera que estes
한국인입니다, 천재 듣고 귀 놀라서 찾아왔어요. 와............... Korean here, “genius” and my ears perked up — had to come check it out. Wow…………… 😮‍💨👏
You should play the next joker.
Ren is one of my favorite artist. Such an amazing talent man! Never stop making music!!! Much love!!!
As much as I relate to Hi Ren and Sick Boi, this one is still my favorite because it sends the message behind the track the best
This is one very talented man great music respect
Amazing ❤❤❤❤❤
Wow it's a Masterpiece, they letter uff , 👌🏻👌🏻
This man is a genius. Truly spectacular
Phenomenal.
Piano, guitar, what else young man.. your so impressive
We are all part of this game. The longer we stay in this, the stronger the game masters get. BTC is the way out, don’t buy BTC, study BTC first.
MASTERPIECE
Tyler North from America,if you see this, please find a way to contact me.
wow, just wow
Your music is brilliant, and your message is true. Stay true to yourself, and we'll stay true to you, too.❤
Ren, others around us knew around us who had a brain or not, those that keep happy stay happy
Ren's lyrics are preferred
Damn what a story❤
This is what music looks like when it is respected as an art form, not as a mass produced slop product
Ren. The modern day Mozart.
To all comrades who read this, we will win and end this bloody system ✊
Left me speechless 😶 ❤
真的好震撼，天才，绝对的天才。
Great Video Ren
Wow just wow. Speechless
I’ve recently just come across Ren, and listened to so many of his songs. As a 14 year old, I am in awe. His songs are unlike literally anything I’ve listened to, and all of them, especially the Money Game and Tale of Jenny and Screech trilogies, evoke such strong emotions within me. Every song, every music video, leaves me speechless. Even though we’re in a time period where the world is pretty messed up, I’m so grateful to have people like Ren who aren’t afraid to acknowledge it. I can’t wait to see what other brilliances he produces, and hope he gets even more recognized than he already is.
Ren needs to do a film or a feature length song as I'd watch this straight for 90 minutes the way his words draw u in captivate u!!
That's a Brecht-Short-Musical - Pure Art!
Fucking Masterpice ❤ So much talent
The prompt says, "Reminds me of" this does't remind me of anything. It's original and beautiful.
Are you on piano I played in the Great Hall where my grandmother took care of Southern man shoots f****** Mansion it was 10 million dollars so they guess houses 2 million I learned to play piano again piano and tell myself in Oregon then coming to a keyboard later and find myself very intense
wow
idk if anyone noticed but this is giving me Hamilton musical vibes...
Insane - your best days are yet to come!! You just keep getting better
If there’s three parts . Why don’t they put them in order ???
The 'cuts' in and out make it so intense (in a good way).
luigi
So damn good!!!
This guy is falco of GB/UK
MASTERPIECE ❤
Money Game part 4 when?
This is the most amazing thing ive witnessed
Oh Lucky...

This is art!
❤
Absolutely stunned. First Ren song I’ve listened to. I see I’ve got some catching up to do..
criminally underrated
Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy One years old and his first words were mine, mine gimme Two years old, he was walking, three years old, walking quickly Four years old, he was running around the pavements of his city Five years old, and his daddy told him, listen here son, you've got to learn to be a man A man he works for what he wants Six years old, and he's reading, writing, top of the bunch And when he's seven, his progression made him student number one Eight years old and he's praised for unusual grades Nine, his parents pay for private school to nurture the flame 10, 11, 12, 13, he ascends and ascends, his daddy tells him, son, money is the means to all ends 14 solving complex mathematic equations, at 15, IQ 150, still elevating 16 he develops complex software code that detects weaknesses in cyber security protocol  17, and he sells his vision, keeping the share, not yet an adult But he's practically a millionaire 18, and his daddy tells him now you're a man the world don't give a damn about you So take all that you can 19, he turns a profit, stocks and shares, invest in product 20, double down deposits 21, his income rockets 22, he learns that truth is just an obstacle to wealth If you manipulate the data, then the lie will sell itself 23, a life of luxury Crystal and cocaine 24, he makes the Forbes list, they're applauding his name 25, and his daddy told him, listen here, son, while you're sitting in the palace That don't mean that you won 26, his business shifts, he switches business to arms He's 27, dealing nuclear shells in Iran 28, inside the Senate, money bought him a seat He's 29, role of counsel in the president suite And now he's 30, his daddy says, you're losing the race You're just a servant to the king, not even in second place 31, a big maneuver for his daddy's approval Moving imports over borders from the exports out of Cuba 32, moving grams, growing kilo to tons He's 33, filling warehouses with powder and guns 34, turf war with nobody to stop it, blind eye from the Po po inside of his pocket  35, he gets a call, I'm sorry, son, but it's your father, had a heart attack I'm sorry, he's gone, 36, getting pissed off abusing this product 37, eyes glazed, disposition demonic 38, with a prostitute, a moment of passion Heating up the silver spoon and then chasing the dragon 39, getting reckless and hungry for power Daddy's words still driving him to kill him and devour He makes a move against the cartel, but the strategy's flawed They retaliate and leave him in the hospital ward A bullet buried in his vertebra, and one in his leg The doctor sighs and says, I don't think you'll be walking again, fuck  Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy He was 40 and he cursed the words mine, mine gimme 41, he wasn't walking, 42, not walking quickly, 43 Never running round the pavements of his city 44 inside a palace with a mountain of gold But those riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves Weighing heavy on his conscience is the value of gold, Lamborghini for a life Trading money for souls, Jimmy followed the code inside the land of the free Put your hand inside the cookie jar, take more than you need And his example is exaggerated versions of me, and it's a version of him And it's a version of she, and it's a version of you There's no escaping the blame, the way we live, it's parasitic Fuck the money and fame, cut the music  This isn't entertainment, this is real life, the way we live is lunacy, community it declines We're hyperpolarized, we're always fighting and we divide Truth is less important than the money that we designed? Money's an invention, politics from our invention, they all come from people's ideas Did I mention, border's an invention Law and order fuels the tension that leads to people killing each other My solution? Everything is subject to change We could build utopias if individuals were taught to use their brains But if we teach kids in schools to always be sheep and put themselves before the herd If there's more money for meat Then there's no future I see where the humans survive We're parasites inside the Petri dish, with cannibal mines Mold will grow upon the surface, then consumes 'til it dies And our fate could be the same without this story to the wise 45, Jimmy comes home out of the rain, soaking wet upon a wheelchair Drinking again, he has everything he wants, he has fortune and fame Such a fortunate fool with an unfortunate fate with a 45 caliber aimed at his brain 45, a fitting number because his age is the same Here's the words of his father, it's such a damn shame Then he presses on the trigger of a money game  Source: LyricFind
3 beautiful songs/videos very captivating.  Love your work, and I know the things we see is only the cusp of what goes on in your head.
Ren I NEED to know how did you do this without a click track. Do you ever use those?
Day 11 of listening to this song every day. Need Part 4 <3
Bruh should act at peaky blinders thou the coming movies 😭😭😭😪
Ren, I think you might be the reincarnated soul of Dylan Thomas.
Leaving this comment so I'll get more subscribers and at the same time keep coming back here to listen to this masterpiece of a banger! 1 2 3 💯
I discovered Ren a few weeks ago and fell in love with the messages, the talent and the music. I am french and have been trying to get people to listen to him../ so far I have converted 5 (That means I need to translate live during songs and make them listen with translation and without it for them to be hooked... but it's worth the time investment) as I can not understand why I had not heard about him before and I want people to understand what they are missing by not listening to him. Thank you Ren, for helping us feel less alon in those struggles.
REN is the new Renaissance 🧿
the complete thing is an opera... great artist
Que timbre se voz tan atrapante❤
Fire
AAAHHHH RAGHHHHH RRAAGEGHHEHHH RRGGGRRR RGGSGAGGAGHRVGHH (i dont have the words to decribe how much i love this, but ill try. Im going feral over here.)  You truly, truly are an artist, Ren, and god i wish i could yell through the screen because im hyperventilating at the way this combines art for what its made. Theatre, cinematography, literature, music, the visual art of filmmaking, I cant even begin to explain the physical, emotional, and mental sensations that your art sends through my body. This is what we are here for. If this isn't why nature allowed for humans to have such complex consciousness, then i don't know what other reasoning there could be.
tupac would have loved this
Ren is an lyrical Genius!!! This is why he is my favorite artist.  Love ya Ren your music has helped me so very much
Trump should watch this but he's probably too dumb to understand.
i cant really say anything except YES
Am I the only one here, that would like to hear an instrumental version of this?
My favorit  peackyblinder😢
He should be in movies!  These videos are the best!! 🎶🎶💖💖
Thank
Uncorftable to listen . Still į find it geneous
Wow
My mom sent me this video she recomended me a w artist
Of course!!! He's lyrics are something sooo legit n true to the bone!!!
idk
all of your songs are masterpiece in my mind
Tom McDonald meets Eminem,but this guy is....bloody amazing!
damn this was a lesson
Bruh😂...
❤❤❤
05:54 is where the magic happens.
Wow just wow !!!!
This is not only hitting my soul, but teaching me a lot about you. The wheelchair, the gown, repeated spit mask visuals…
Maybe the most impressive filmmaking for a music video I have seen - the fact that they live recorded all of the audio is a feat in and of itself.
Why the fuck is this guy not on top of all the charts?! Seriously!
This song is about Elon…😂
Is 45 a reference to trumps first term?
I love you and your message.
I love your art. Thank you. Welsh need a voice. You give it. Thank you
Honestly...i kinda wish my dad had told me some of those things. At least his dad was right there telling him things.
The man's a genius
Fuck what uag says people can react how they want shit thats our freedom to do so
Has Ren discovered Bitcoin yet I wonder ???
You are a true artist, sir. Bravo.
Ren an absolute artist and genius!!!!Thank you for using your talent for the greater good. Absolutely amazing
You knew what was coming Ren❤
If anyone can pull this off, it's you. Never in my life have I seen a human being that is such a force to be reckoned with. You are literally so ridiculously amazing at absolutely anything & everything you put your mind to. If there's something you're passionate about, that you truly put your heart into, there's nothing in the world you can't achieve. Not only will you achieve it, but you'll do it so well that people will lose their minds all over again. When ppl say your talent is limitless & knows no bounds, that's no exaggeration. God sure knew what he was doing when he blessed this world with your presence. Every once in a great while a person comes along & you just know they have the ability to take over the world if they chose to. You, Ren, are one of those ppl. You never cease to amaze me. The limitless talent that seems so effortless (even though I know you've spent your life perfecting your craft, it's your calling, so it comes so naturally to you), your tenacious drive, the most caring heart & purest, truest soul I've ever witnessed. I cannot wait to see what all life has in store for you. You've already achieved great things so the sky is the limit.
Loved it til he slammed the CZ-75....that was where a drew the line.  Gun Violence I do not condone.

What the hell did. I See. Needed To Get old To See art
You are an amazing dude. I keep coming back to this song and the others and I'm just left amazed, vibing and happy.
WOW
wow, you amaze me!
One heck of a can of worms now "Dealing nuclear and shells in Iran"  - 3:53
So much of Renee Magritte in this video. I love the stylistic lighting and the symbolism while it still stays clean and simple and doesn't distract from the very clear musical message.. So freaking good man.
Ren your voice calm me enoush to sleep soundly
Bloody Brilliant...
Absolutely amazing masterpiece…I am blown away…
from Russia with love
I felt this so deep, I can literally relate ❤
So......this is a communist anthem.  That sucks how he ended the song with that message. .
I love the song but it seems like the piano sound got stolen from  Edvard Grieg‘s piano concerto op. 16….
You are just UNBELIEVABLE 🙌🙌 How did I miss this one
Dude. What the fuck is this? 4th song I’ve found by this dude!
Beautifully talented! @ren you're a beautiful diamond 💎  So many different sides and cuts. Made from the pressure of pain. Some sides are so perfect and some so flawed from pain. Yet no matter you shine so bright, when in the right light.  I understand this pain. I feel it and see it in your music/poetry/storytelling/songs. Every word is true and yet we don't want to believe. You have such a gift and I'm grateful you share it, you beautiful diamond 💎 💖

You are such a talented individual, Ren. Excellent language skills and truly poetic. I love every song I've heard from you, to be honest. Hope to see a lot more of you.
Ontstopsble force
Ren,, i dunno if yoh watch this.. 1 if you are hiring 🫡 2 youre a legend 3 thanks
This is pure art. How are more people not talking about this? It's this generation version of mozart or michelangelo. Insane talent.  Kudos to the director too of course
True artistry. Love your songs and videos. Keep up the great work!
my anime fans my anime fans
No guns.and no war
🤣🥲
This is the type of teaching that is necessary for the present. Ren, you are sent from God, a modern day prophet. Jim was similar to Solomon except Solomon came to this conclusion: Fear God  and Love, this is the whole duty of man.
i love it
Everything's outstanding here, the music, the lyrics, the stage, the costums, the idea.  And I'd like to highlight that I love how every castmember is mentioned in the description, giving them credit aswell. Huge respect!
So fucken cringyyyyy
Bro voice doesn’t go with charachter
Watched for the first time. I had to sit for a minute to just digest it all, and I don't think I'm done. I'm still bawling my eyes out, you and your crew are masterful.
The way we live is parasitic
Everything is so dark with this guy. I get it; life’s trials define us, but that’s nothing but lie. You can be set free from the mental torment “if” you really wanted to accept truth…Jesus Christ.
This just gets better and better.
would be cool to see him team up with tim minchin :)
Not just rapping... Art 😮😮
Do your thing and dont ever sell yourself. You doing amazing. Fight for musical freedom. Cheers from Portugal.
reennnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
Ive been listening to ren when Hi ren dropped and was everywhere. Love his style of music.
You are a genius. That hit too deep and too hard.  Much love!!
A ren nd Kendrick collab will be tuff!!
ts is PEAK
3:31 🔥 This is spot on. And then continue to do that for 10+ years and we arrive where we are now, with the people who spent the most time on phones and social media being the most strongly brainwashed group. The less time we spend on media and phones the more grounded in reality our thoughts and perspectives are. This is such an amazing piece of art and one of the healthy ways to use social media. 👍👍
Crazy good
Masterpiece
BOOM......AGAIN A MARVELOUS SONG......YOU KEEP BLOWING MY MIND
Just when you thought you heard it all
You are SO TALENTED!!! I am obsessed with all 3 sangs!!!
excellent as always 👌 👏 👍
Amazing
Absulute masterpiece 😮‍💨
10/10
Love this. Thank You
6:50- 8:25 🫰🫰🫰
I would like to marry Ren, even though I never wanted to get married😂❤❤❤
This guy is something else. My braincells are about to explode. So rich, fresh, with a powerful narrative... and I can keep going and going. I lost someone that went down the drain thanks to the Money Game. Wow... this is definitely a Masterpiece for me!
Wish all money game parts could be more listen in this dark times in the us
Cant wait for the feature length musical in part 4
love the mix of "Hamilton" in this💕
Putting the Art in Artist ! Brilliant
Pt1; A look at the world in money game Pt2; A how to succeed in the money game Pt3; A look at how empty things are after succeeding in our game.
Uncle Nelson from Schedule 1 be like
❤ is lovely , I relax listening to your music, it seems wired but my brain gets better 😊
Who is here from tiktok?
Ngl until age 13 when i was overpressured and burnt out which made me disillusioned and realize im this golden child puer aeternus and my father is actually a dumbass i was like jimmy
So sorry my first listen to late
Definitivamente amo a este hombre, gritaloooooo mi amor ❤❤
I truly thought that "Hi Ren" could not be topped as a fucking masterpiece and it still hasn't been with this song, but it is so much a better production than so much of the cheap quick stuff Ren does. If Ren could take a cue from Denzel washington, stop flooding the market with your filler and fill it with your masterpieces, which you clearly hold inside you.
Absolutely BRILLIANT!!! ❤👏👏👏👏
...wtf
Just all be happy for knowing him so long I just found him tonight and he is a genius amazing smart and different love it
i love how it goes from "my solution?" to a suicide scene lmao  but seriously this is such gold. not a lot of 4th wall breaking media makes me shiver as much as this one's "this isnt entertainement". amazing reveal that even the audience is treating this like a commodity
Wow
This is not a masterpiece its a master whole damm thing.
🎉 this facts and i pray God heals you and keeps blessing you 🙏
What a great storyteller
💯❤
Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy One years old and his first words were mine, mine gimme Two years old, he was walking, three years old, walking quickly Four years old, he was running around the pavements of his city Five years old, and his daddy told him, listen here son, you've got to learn to be a man A man he works for what he wants Six years old, and he's reading, writing, top of the bunch And when he's seven, his progression made him student number one Eight years old and he's praised for unusual grades Nine, his parents pay for private school to nurture the flame 10, 11, 12, 13, he ascends and ascends, his daddy tells him, son, money is the means to all ends 14 solving complex mathematic equations, at 15, IQ 150, still elevating 16 he develops complex software code that detects weaknesses in cyber security protocol 17, and he sells his vision, keeping the share, not yet an adult But he's practically a millionaire 18, and his daddy tells him now you're a man the world don't give a damn about you So take all that you can 19, he turns a profit, stocks and shares, invest in product 20, double down deposits 21, his income rockets 22, he learns that truth is just an obstacle to wealth If you manipulate the data, then the lie will sell itself 23, a life of luxury Crystal and cocaine 24, he makes the Forbes list, they're applauding his name 25, and his daddy told him, listen here, son, while you're sitting in the palace That don't mean that you won 26, his business shifts, he switches business to arms He's 27, dealing nuclear shells in Iran 28, inside the Senate, money bought him a seat He's 29, role of counsel in the president suite And now he's 30, his daddy says, you're losing the race You're just a servant to the king, not even in second place 31, a big maneuver for his daddy's approval Moving imports over borders from the exports out of Cuba 32, moving grams, growing kilo to tons He's 33, filling warehouses with powder and guns 34, turf war with nobody to stop it, blind eye from the Po po inside of his pocket 35, he gets a call, I'm sorry, son, but it's your father, had a heart attack I'm sorry, he's gone, 36, getting pissed off abusing this product 37, eyes glazed, disposition demonic 38, with a prostitute, a moment of passion Heating up the silver spoon and then chasing the dragon 39, getting reckless and hungry for power Daddy's words still driving him to kill him and devour He makes a move against the cartel, but the strategy's flawed They retaliate and leave him in the hospital ward A bullet buried in his vertebra, and one in his leg The doctor sighs and says, I don't think you'll be walking again, fuck Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy He was 40 and he cursed the words mine, mine gimme 41, he wasn't walking, 42, not walking quickly, 43 Never running round the pavements of his city 44 inside a palace with a mountain of gold But those riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves Weighing heavy on his conscience is the value of gold, Lamborghini for a life Trading money for souls, Jimmy followed the code inside the land of the free Put your hand inside the cookie jar, take more than you need And his example is exaggerated versions of me, and it's a version of him And it's a version of she, and it's a version of you There's no escaping the blame, the way we live, it's parasitic Fuck the money and fame, cut the music This isn't entertainment, this is real life, the way we live is lunacy, community it declines We're hyperpolarized, we're always fighting and we divide Truth is less important than the money that we designed? Money's an invention, politics from our invention, they all come from people's ideas Did I mention, border's an invention Law and order fuels the tension that leads to people killing each other My solution? Everything is subject to change We could build utopias if individuals were taught to use their brains But if we teach kids in schools to always be sheep and put themselves before the herd If there's more money for meat Then there's no future I see where the humans survive We're parasites inside the Petri dish, with cannibal mines Mold will grow upon the surface, then consumes 'til it dies And our fate could be the same without this story to the wise 45, Jimmy comes home out of the rain, soaking wet upon a wheelchair Drinking again, he has everything he wants, he has fortune and fame Such a fortunate fool with an unfortunate fate with a 45 caliber aimed at his brain 45, a fitting number because his age is the same Here's the words of his father, it's such a damn shame Then he presses on the trigger of a money game.
❤❤❤
money game series... exists incase yall ever wondered which side of history REN is on...
Cillian Murphy just out here doing everything at this point
Spectacular! Unbelievable!
The whole bloody thing, genius
That piano! Wow!!
sadly, it's too late to save humanity from its own greed and sheepish way. love ur art though; as dark and true as it is, i hope it gets felt and understood by those who can change things (though i doubt they'd care tbh)
😇 ❤️ 🔥

incredible
just realised the things are forefathers had to go through for us, death, destruction, for the good of people yet we continue to destroy and disrespect them for no reason than to blame, money is a nightmare of which we cannot escape.
America, stands in this lyrical composure of our and others struggle, and by America, I mean The People, I don't know how much time we have left but.. thank you for sharing this man, The 99% is losing hope as we speak. It's only a matter of time.

WHY IS IT THE GRANNY BASEMENT!? thanks Ren. do you mine?
This is incredible. Ren cooks
I need a song REN with the music from 5:56 absolute Goosebumps
This song is my social anxiety speaking....
Mat pac if he was in a alternate universe
Yooo what ren was the slanderman this whole time
I "felt" this. Thank you.
Long time youtuber for music. Can't believe it took this long for the algorithm to send me your music because it is amazing!!!
If you don't like ren get the duck out
I wonder if like the Roman Republic we are doomed to crumble under corruption and war. History repeats.
Hi Ren so many things to say about this. Everything about it hit home, I wish we knew each other this is the closest thing I have ever heard to putting words to my personal struggles therapy has always left me lacking because I never knew how to describe my mind. Thank you for opening up and sharing. You are talented and inspiring. One 9 min video did more than years of therapy did to describe what inside of me.
Your musical talent is mind blowing. You are a lyrical genius and the visuals are equally impactful.

This amazingly beautiful made ❤
2:49 he reminds me of Thomas Shelby
Love it my fav set of songs is Money Game
The one time on YouTube i wish there was a love react❤❤❤❤
What a Masterpiece
My granddaughter is a great Fan and showed me a Video, now I'm a Fan too, great artist but in Austria only a few people know him ❤
At least people can dive deep inside each of this 3 masterpieces just to get hi on information
I have listened to this so many times. You are in my brain. The dance is tough,  I cry every time I listen to this.i used to dream of going to Italy,  my dream is down to go and watch you busk. If you are in Canada for treatment , pop in.
Amazing Sir! From The Cowboy Capital of the World Oakdale California. Hi Ren hit hard. lifelong fibro and neuropathy, i am 45.
HEY

😅 🎉 no1
I'm not gonna say anything, I'm still in awe
His vocal here related to the vocals in violets tale,,,, soooo soothing
Thomas Shelby look
One thing I’ve always wanted to ask..the beginning piano part just before the camera starts spinning his upward hand movement then coming down to play..the music doesn’t synch..the note plays before the hand comes down..is this just a post production error? It bothers me every watch 😂
Just wow
Being human means saying Free Palestine. I hate that politicians have so much power. But I dont care again and again Free Palestine
Read everything ❤
It is just awesome
Creative Genius. Absolutely incredible Ren. 🙌
I rarely comment.  Wow! Just “WOW”
This is an other level of art ❤
Today, i listened to the spotify version. The live action one with slight bits of improv is clearly better.
Damn Ren is a genius... seriously
Ts so fire 😪🔥
Masterpiece

MrBeast draw my life

5:52 went wild the beat hit hard ( I'm adding this to my spotify list)
hI ren well done mate. you are extremely gifted. your songs and videos are truly unique and artistic. i appreciate that you use it to be thought provoking, inspiring and encouraging. God bless brother. stay strong when the pendulum is muludnep. keep swinging
i leave my comment, that needs more than 3 words for algorithm, but just one word: great!
This song kind of fits lil mabu

Wow.

Im a really big fan ren if your seeing this your my fave singer i wanted to become a singer cuz of you and i use your songs on tiktok im a big big fan
My solution (not mine but) ⬇️
Money Game 4 .... how the  queens and kings colonised and looted countries like India.... UK per capita income reaches 58000 usd while ex colonies struggle at 3000 usd..... atleast return the kohinoor diamond..... what a shame
Golden
Everybody who made this happen needs and award
Love this Ren I wish I could see you in a concert 😢 😊
Excellant big sparkily tune. Need to chart EVERYWHERE!
BRAVO!
sharigan killer fr
mrbeast became bbq after listening after this💀
Leave your finger from the trigger, you can hurt yourself!
Iam a female Drummer and huge music lover n just found Ren him last night . So brilliant playing guitar and piano. His voice lyrics style of videos so brilliant ..  damn ty Ren I needed some new music to listen to. I like 90s music all kinds down to 80s even 50s newer stuff just can't get into but Ren freaking awesome brilliant fire
and brick layers thyer part ofm the lie
Algorithm
Im 46 year old, Been watching music videos all my life, This is Top 1!
This boy is golden. In the best way possible.
I love this mans mind!
This has me shaking, the entire trilogy is incredible.
Rhyming “leg” with “again” is crazy
Tommy Shelvy, is that you?
Ren needs to write a movie and star it himself.
Everything you create carries such a powerful message. You are a literary genius and someone who gets it!
Genius
Going 44 next month and i lost my dad almost a year ago. I found Ren almost a month ago and i am very sorry i didn't before. Cause my dad would love his talent. But i am also very happy that i had a dad like him, that taught me and my sister to be human beings, not like Jimmy. So i have a chance to see past 45. Thank you Ren, this is a masterpiece of art.
Excellent! Masterpiece of art.
OMG!!! Absolute genius mixing all types of art to deliver messages for humanity’s consciousness to open. Best of all I’ve seen, heard, watched and learned in my life… I am 42.
Too many people have said this, but it's truly like if you gave the internet to a bard
Musical genius
I love the fast paced rap time but I bet your singing voice is beautiful ❤
WOW WOW DO U UNDERSTAND WHAT GOD IS SAYING THEOUGH THIS MAN? DO U HAVE A CLUE ??????????
JUST CHILLING
Wooooow. The goosebumps....
THIS is art
A genius:amongst us ! Got be with the greatest writer's of all time:not just songs he devours the soul.
Found you last night and you keep taking my breath away. You are amazing!!
Tgis is just a pure work of genius 👏 Wrll rone renmakesmusic & everyone else invilved backstage it's a work of absolute henius mate i wish you all the best & all tye best health mste from your huge fan.... A fellow Welshman 🫡
Gnadenlos
Ren should play Tommy Shelby i the war.
Ren needs invited to every Party to tell a story. He is amazing!!
His music is important, it helps as I hv EUPBD,music magical
Absolutely one of the most talented lyrists and artists I've ever seen!! I grew up adoring Fiona apple in the early 2000s so to see someone with so much talent absolutely blows me away!
WAUW!!
This had me bawling - so true
Absolute art
Wow, I have goose bumps. this is a masterpiece.
MY FAVORITE MUSICAL VIDEO OF ALL TIME.  I LEARNED THIS PART ON MY PIANO. I LOVE REN AND HOW HARD HE WORKS. ♥️💜🩵💙💜♥️ CAROL FROM NYC
Listening to all 3 parts of this, very much reminds me of Muse - Animals, similar lyrics (obviously different) but similar meaning, it’s like it’s money game but in one 4min song, would recommend checking it out
Damn! Never stop writing, this is brilliant!
I fell in love again
What a message ! the quintessence of today's upbringing. Some people, and there are many of them, should be played this song endlessly. With little hope that the message will reach them.
Vhu yes good suace
I just wanted to let you know that your “reaction” videos are the best that I have seen.  I was introduced to REN a couple of years ago and I was floored. His music is multifaceted in ways that I have never heard before. His messages are both a warning and a reminder, in poetry, and your interpretations are spot on. I discovered your page through REN, and I can’t wait to hear your thoughts on other artists. I appreciate you. :)
I keep returning here
ren youll never know how much i respect you
First I thought it is a history of John Maccafe
Fucking BRILLIANT!!!! 👏👏👏
This is really good, vocals amazing, but this is also very depressing because this is real life and this can happen to someone which is really sad.  Thank you ren
Elon,that u?
3:55 to be in the US senate, you need to be at least 30 years old. For him to enter at 28, he would need to get a constitutional amendment to passed.
I... i feel weak hearing this again... Sometimes i... sometimes i forget our society abandoned the happines and colective emotion... Before we enslaved war prisoners, then we enslaved different cultures, and now we enslave what the system considers to be "the weak".  And to me, being "weak" has less to be with minorities and actual to be with how much youcare about others... Trying to help the world will just kill you in the long run, so why help?...  Im going to cry a second time just in this rewatch...
This makes me think Broadway 4:37
Genuinely the best production I’ve ever seen I could watch this for days
I think we all want to share one😂😂,👌😎✌️😌❤❤❤😂😂
Ren, you are a life saver. I was gonna pull the trigger of a money game today. Thank you. ✊
can we get a colab between Ren and Immortal Technique? that would be insane - different but similar styles
That piano is Masterclass
Mastery
The first time I heard Ren was on tic toc. I'm 70 with an eclectic love of music. This boy has soooo much talent. His diction is clear which is a plus for someone my age😂😂😂.  Keep going Ren. I see shorts of cover versions of songs. It would be great to hear the full versions. ❤❤❤❤
I'd say this song is about Elon except Elon's an idiot
Please help me. I don't want my babies like  that
😢
<3
Next lvl story telling
4:33 the way he turned his head has me dead laughing
Daddy’s horrible
Absolutely amazing
This is not music.This is art
Amazing comment for algorithm
Thankfully this is real talent, not AI
Dude, your music keeps hitting me hard.
Wow I'm speechless. Just wow.   Definitely hit the nail on the head with this one.  Thank you for your truths and speaking what the world so coldly refuses to accept on a daily basis. Thank you for putting into such reality that maybe more people will watch and actually think or wake up.   You're amazing
Love this
Uffff ren you are incredible really
Wow Elon Musk has his own theme song.
I listened to all the Money Game songs but for the first time I just watched them back to back and I gotta say: this is an INCREDIBLE work of art. The whole story telling and message is absolutely stunning. Amazing job with this   Ren! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Got to be amongst the greatest song writer's n lyracists forever man:he touches the soul.
2:02 he looks like Ronaldo
Is it just me or does he look like Thomas Shelby lmao.
Ren?
Ren is for you I'm a french listener and I want to you this slam offer :  You bled in bars, so we could breathe in truth. Each verse a scalpel, carving through the youth. No mask, no mercy — just mirror and flame. Ren, you don’t play music — you rename pain
Damn
Meghalaya India❤
He just tell the truth in another level ❤❤❤
Damn
Everything this man does with his music and storytelling captivates me.
When a 9 minute music video can tell a story better than Hollywood
You change people's lives.. not many people can say that x
I wonder how many watched this thinking "They are not the problem"
This is art
This is absolutely masterful 🤯
when i first listened to this on release i thought part2 was better but now i think this song is genius
❤
You've given me hope, that some others too ache for change... ache badly for it as I do
Genius.
Was this one shot? It felt like it but I'm unsure.
Das falsche Spiel!! Der Jackpot ist das Leben!❤
Brilliant. Honestly worried about humanity and here is the why.
Why isn't he signed but Dre?
Interesting. It's the contemporary version of the 1980s American Hardcore movement.
you are putting into words what our generation wants to tell, we all try but you did it perfectly
Grump should watch this, but something telks me it wouldn't make any difference, unfortunately.😢
Musical genius
🔥
Knock me out of the Matrix
Remembering the words would be a task to this song.very clever love it
Masterpiece. Masterclass.   Everything was incredible. Good job to this entire team.   And nice "quote" from Grieg Piano Concerto in A minor ;)
Popping in the comments for love. I hope the new(est) treatment blows expectations out of the water. I want you healthily around, semi-selfishly. You're a brighter light than average, the world can't afford if you went out. Hoping for at leat Money Game part 10 if you're up for it, too many more inspirations.
Every time I see your face, I think your the lead actor I'd 28 days later
Bruh 0.0 was that "Attack on Titan  theme song" that piano in the begin was hella dope ! :::)
I love the emotions you are able to bring out in your songs. It’s truly art!!
Edgy theater kid music is what I crave, is what I love. Bring more of this back.
Why do I feel the need to stand and clap after seeing a Ren video? Not only is he amazing but so are the ones who create his videos.
A modern musical maestro
Poetic. Love it

10M views on this is insane. This quality deservers 100x more
Amazing work 🔥
Suburb Ren you never disappoint 🤘🫶🫶❣️💪💪💪
Life
WE are not a costume.
What a team of total and utter geniuses, to a person. I can’t say how moving and powerful your performances are because you go so far beyond the limits of language. Mind blowingly brilliant, thought provoking, creative and even almost comical at points, you can feel good inside at all the beautiful vibes you are creating. Thank you soooo much ❤
Instructions unclear im now the leader of the cartel
this is one of my favourite songs
Absolutely amazing my guy🤝🏾so many feel this way and don’t know how to express it. VERY CREATIVE🙌🏾
3 bullets in the mag is really hitting hard now.
Beautiful
Masterpiece
14 + is something else well done ren
He says as he's making money off of not contributing to society
After all this year, the finger gun was foreshadowing after all
Masterpiece
now that's a stort
hmmm love this
..!!  just ..wow..this  is art  !I am  a  woman  and this  hit  me  hard !!!
😮 he is a genius 💯
Give this man whatever he needs because he is astonishing.
this is legendary
👍
Ren your an amazing artist❤❤❤
Say it, Tommy Shelby!
Sooooooooo is he dead?
I've watched it hundreds of times and I always feel like my sick brain is looking for some puzzle piece. Today it arrived. The part where Jimmy is in a wheelchair is like Scarface, but with Cillian Murphy! 😂😍  What I need for a beautiful day -  cup of coffee, a cigarette and some Ren's art. 🫶  Oh thank you, dear Ren, for being you and giving us all this! 💕
I like how Ren describes Jimmys patriarchal parenting with his fathers words of being a man, by having money, influence and power. So his father plays a central role in Jimmys life. It gets even clearer when Jimmy receives the call about his deceased father. The globe on the table stops turning, symbolizing the death of the father as Jimmys world stops turning.
I love your heart ❤️❤️❤️
We are not alone ❤
Dylan,Cohen & Kristoffersen all rolled into one.
I think I figured it out.  Don’t strategize against the cartel after your brain has already turned to pudding.    Or don’t be so greedy; definitely one of the two.
The universe.   Thank you REN
peaple simp over you
I love it but also it's crige
What a beautiful piece of art. You are someone that I will follow forever.
Dear Ren, One of the admirer of your works here. Love each and every songs of yours along with the message it spreads. I just wanna request you for a slightly longer clean version of the violin piece here. 6:00 This sounds so good that it brings tears to my eyes. ❤❤❤❤
Top lad
this is such a brilliant song truly.. , lyrically , musically PURE genius!
Mother Earth created us, and we destroy ourselves upon it, taking it with us.  Free thought is a crime, follow trends for your dime.  Player one, player two—player me, player you, but you're not playing through; because I've got a gun, so fuck you.  Trigger, trigger, suddenly, jammed: Made in China, our prehistoric motherland. But twisting of fate, fingers are crossed, Mother Earth frowns upon us and chokes us with smog.  Because if me winning is our cost, well, I'm Made in America, and you're a profit loss.   Goodbye humanity—you destroyed what you could, and shit on your own corpse; your only act of good.  A fitting end for the parasite that murdered Freedom of Thought and dressed it in our dead ancestors (that's polyester, for the corpses at the back).  Now we're dead.
Ren is crazy talented. I not only like his music and message, but he looks just like my son, who also suffers from chronic Lyme.
This is one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever seen
I just recently discovered ren and I wish I would have discovered you sooner because you’re music is like gold in my eyes
Always Ren
Uncle Ted was right...
Make a musical already, im all in for it
Ren the Wizard. The modern bard ❤
What an incredible piece of art.
The piano is incredible work, also love the message
"Let me tell you a story about a man named Jimmy"
This is what art is supposed to be. Truth ❤ a means for a message that needs to be heard
WOW
However, involve more strings! I'm smiling over here! Never stop! Humans!
Ce mec devrait faire un film franchement génial 👍👍👍
sick bro keep it up
Gotta love how even this series of critique gives in to the capitalist propaganda. Shows this way to success but says the greed is the bad thing. Compeletely forgetting how majority of people, even if greedier than Jimmy won't ever get rich. They will be under people like Jimmy, forever, never able to get out.
were so back
❤❤❤
Masterpiece!😳💚
THIS IS A MASTER MASTERPIECE Ren you are REN-SATIONAL REN-SPIRING  REN -VOLOUTIONARY  ❤❤❤
Wish he shared sooner..... so we could have shared his despair which helped him repair this is why he is there/ here... and this is the reason why we are here/ there wherever REN IS XXX❤❤❤❤
Director.... Direct..Directing Directional..Directed  Directly ..Direction  Directory ..Directive  Directions..Directness ........
Yes
♨
Almost every revolution is born from artists. People today don't realize what artists are capable of.
Mindblown. The music, the lyrics, the visual, the meaning, the nessage all come together so well, this is peak art. ❤
He's an fortunate fool with an unforunate faith😢

The lyrics Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy One years old and his first words were mine, mine gimme Two years old, he was walking, three years old, walking quickly Four years old, he was running around the pavements of his city Five years old, and his daddy told him, listen here son, you've got to learn to be a man A man he works for what he wants Six years old, and he's reading, writing, top of the bunch And when he's seven, his progression made him student number one Eight years old and he's praised for unusual grades Nine, his parents pay for private school to nurture the flame 10, 11, 12, 13, he ascends and ascends, his daddy tells him, son, money is the means to all ends 14 solving complex mathematic equations, at 15, IQ 150, still elevating 16 he develops complex software code that detects weaknesses in cyber security protocol 17, and he sells his vision, keeping the share, not yet an adult But he's practically a millionaire 18, and his daddy tells him now you're a man the world don't give a damn about you So take all that you can 19, he turns a profit, stocks and shares, invest in product 20, double down deposits 21, his income rockets 22, he learns that truth is just an obstacle to wealth If you manipulate the data, then the lie will sell itself 23, a life of luxury Crystal and cocaine 24, he makes the Forbes list, they're applauding his name 25, and his daddy told him, listen here, son, while you're sitting in the palace That don't mean that you won 26, his business shifts, he switches business to arms He's 27, dealing nuclear shells in Iran 28, inside the Senate, money bought him a seat He's 29, role of counsel in the president suite And now he's 30, his daddy says, you're losing the race You're just a servant to the king, not even in second place 31, a big maneuver for his daddy's approval Moving imports over borders from the exports out of Cuba 32, moving grams, growing kilo to tons He's 33, filling warehouses with powder and guns 34, turf war with nobody to stop it, blind eye from the Po po inside of his pocket 35, he gets a call, I'm sorry, son, but it's your father, had a heart attack I'm sorry, he's gone, 36, getting pissed off abusing this product 37, eyes glazed, disposition demonic 38, with a prostitute, a moment of passion Heating up the silver spoon and then chasing the dragon 39, getting reckless and hungry for power Daddy's words still driving him to kill him and devour He makes a move against the cartel, but the strategy's flawed They retaliate and leave him in the hospital ward A bullet buried in his vertebra, and one in his leg The doctor sighs and says, I don't think you'll be walking again, fuck Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy He was 40 and he cursed the words mine, mine gimme 41, he wasn't walking, 42, not walking quickly, 43 Never running round the pavements of his city 44 inside a palace with a mountain of gold But those riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves Weighing heavy on his conscience is the value of gold, Lamborghini for a life Trading money for souls, Jimmy followed the code inside the land of the free Put your hand inside the cookie jar, take more than you need And his example is exaggerated versions of me, and it's a version of him And it's a version of she, and it's a version of you There's no escaping the blame, the way we live, it's parasitic Fuck the money and fame, cut the music This isn't entertainment, this is real life, the way we live is lunacy, community it declines We're hyperpolarized, we're always fighting and we divide Truth is less important than the money that we designed? Money's an invention, politics from our invention, they all come from people's ideas Did I mention, border's an invention Law and order fuels the tension that leads to people killing each other My solution? Everything is subject to change We could build utopias if individuals were taught to use their brains But if we teach kids in schools to always be sheep and put themselves before the herd If there's more money for meat Then there's no future I see where the humans survive We're parasites inside the Petri dish, with cannibal mines Mold will grow upon the surface, then consumes 'til it dies And our fate could be the same without this story to the wise 45, Jimmy comes home out of the rain, soaking wet upon a wheelchair Drinking again, he has everything he wants, he has fortune and fame Such a fortunate fool with an unfortunate fate with a 45 caliber aimed at his brain 45, a fitting number because his age is the same Here's the words of his father, it's such a damn shame Then he presses on the trigger of a money game
wonderful, the Americans have a lot to learn about poetry
That last bridge part, with the small orchestra, was actually Intro from XX played right?

Just adding to the algo and loving the work
This is just fucking straight up ART
You're 🔥🔥🔥
Holy chit man, i just found you and am now a huge fan.  All of your songs hit hard in the feels.
In a society where profit is its highest value, there's no room for any other value. A doomed pyramid with cold material on top.  I am personally not against pursuing a wealthy life, as after the basic necessities for survival and a dignified life are accomodated, there should still be some material room left - for everyone - for investing in their own dreams, a certain freedom and room to make mistakes and try again before one becomes homeless and hopeless. I believe in a society with equal opportunities and where one has special talents and is sharing them with the world, should be able to create more quality and to help others (if that is within their own heart, too, but not all talented people have it, so I'm not here to blame anyone).  What's sad...is when material and spiritual are not in balance. When adults have managed reaching a certain age, solely focusing on their competitive goals, out of fear, never out of love.  But Love is more powerful than fear and it is more powerful than hate and it is more powerful than greed, it is more powerful than the illusory lack of it and Love will find its way to the coldest of hearts, one day and everything will be fixed as it will rightfully be Top Value on the top of a metaphorical pyramid. ✨🫶⚡
You are so good🎉
🎉🎉
glad I found you

But i say he has... A few times
This frickin guy         This frickin NF guy is a genius, a true GOAT already, best song/video combo ever except for REN moneygame 3
I've been listening non-stop this past week, and it's incredible. The message is so clear and very  well put. You put the economics and society in a perspective that everyone needs to see!
I really like this one, and I especially appreciate the quartet in the end. I really really hope he does something more music/ story telling including a quartet, those are my favorite instruments. They can easily make me cry on their own. But his story telling also do.
Perfect
Ren, you've been sent from God to teach us all lesons. I'm  60 years old and just discovered you two days ago, and I cried when seeing your video "Hi Ren " so relatable to my own challenges in the path we tread in this paradox .  Keep spreading your LOVE ❤️ and sharing God's gift to us all. Thank you
I’m doing a deep dive into this music right now, and I’m loving this. It’s deep but not preachy
am i crazy for thinking that music like this does more good in the world than anything any politician has done in the last...... i don't even know?
Oh i don't know someone makes a song about trumps life 😅
Trump should watch this!
nice edit.
1:40 ❤❤
Peak story telling 🔥
Probably one of the most important things I've seen in my life

Who else comes from, HI Ren in 2025.
Part 4, please—been sitting with Part 3 heavy. You speak like you’ve lived a thousand lives already. Your words don’t just hit, they settle in deep. I need more of that—your lens, your leap
Art at is pure state! So glad to found Ren's musica, cheers from Portugal.

Genuine genius
This is ART ❤️
1:21 pov me in a math test 😅
this guy is genius
Best ren's song
This has become my favourite song!!!!
this is very good
Short Movie 😍
È stupenda!!!!
Elon musk should listen to this
The way he had his finger on the trigger even when he wasn’t preparing to shoot gave me anxiety. That is literally the only thing wrong with this song other than it being based on real life
es como verlo cantar a thomas shelby
I'm confused is this by enimem or someone else entirely
Ok well I'm a mom here. Boring life. Currently folding laundry.  My husband and children downstairs. I'm just silently sobbing.   I'm 34. I feel a lot of regrets. This song is a true fear of mine since raising 2 boys. I'm terrified of what my discipline, choice of words, lessons and conditioning could lead to. I can read everything there is about raising children and how important self care is while raising children because of how fcking draining it is. You lose your identity. Balancing seems impossible. I finally gave in and started therapy several years ago (I always assumed talking to someone about my problems was a waste). I ran out of ideas so I began therapy.  I can say, it hasn't done anything for me. Sometimes a good cry is necessary.
Ten you’re absolute genius
I just found you/your music today. Im hooked and will be sharing you. So much hits home, so well done, all of it.
Powerful, Brilliant, Magnifico....I expect nothing less from you.
HOPE!
He really motivated me 😮
❤❤❤

What a masterpiece.
This is the most stupid idea I ever heard.
This is the most stupid idea Bever heard.
i like & i love ur music style
Just finding out about Ren, love it! Can't get enough, Genius! I love the storytelling, I've never heard anything like this, very unique
"you're such a damn shame", music stops, chills every time
Respect 🔥
Wow wow wow!
7th April 2025 this day i ve found REN. i wish i had known him sooner
Over 70 me. I'd written off 'new' recorded music as endlessly bland samey crap or nasty sexy/bragging samey crap. Then I find Ren. Ok, I'm a bit late to the party but now am very here.  Voice, lyrics, guitar, piano, visuals, rhythm, courage, soul and kindness. A gem.
Good work, keep it coming. World wake up, do whatever makes you happy, break the chains, do not let them take control of your soul
Fuuuuuck me! Like... Peaky Blinders in XXI century - crossover we didn't know we wanted, surely didn't deserve, but so much needed. Oi lad - you're something else 🖤 and definitely a real one!
This is absolutely amazing and moreover a lesson.

I'm glad awards are starting to appear, there's so many more you deserve, but even if you never get them, we the renegades know who's top.
Great work 👌
only just found out about this champ, going down the rabbit hole!
❤
"Selling nuclear shells in Iran" why ren did you make me an ex fan... You should have stuck to the truth not fabricating lies for your new masters.. it wouldn't have hurt you to speak a little about isreahell the monster of this world.
Wow this is deep
❤
God god my boy! You are the beast 💪
JEEZUS WEPT that was thought provoking....
Not me. I could have money and fame. I am a journalist, in my country. I was not interested to sell my conscience, not even once.
I am absolutely blown away by this Man. His mind is extraordinary. Every single person in this World should hear EVERY SINGLE WORD he has to say... 🖤🩶🤍
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Brilliant in every way
I discovered you today.  I'm glad I did.  Discovering an honest artist is special.  This is performance art at it's best.  Raw, real, meaningful, and moving.  I've never hit the subscribe button with such anticipation for what comes next.  Thank you.

@mrbeast needs to e-transfer me the million dollars I dreamt he sent me! 😮
Some of the best spoken word of modern times is at the end of this... truly a work of art from start to finish
Brilliant, absolutely brilliant
Ren is a great artist, dont get me wrong, but I can't help but feel that he looks like a 36 year old tiktok f*ckboy
My only problem with this song is I seriously doubt a man in Jimmy's position would really change much at all by being crippled. I mean, I know that's not the point, but still.
👏👏👏❤️✌️🫶🏻🙏🏻✨✨✨✨
✌️✌️✨🫶🏻❤️
i dont like the speaking past his age thing its hard enough being in the present or the past
Your 'fucking' lyrics  Masterpiece

Omg I listened to this song maybe like 3 times and I knew it all and my parent were like hella impressed because I’m Dutch!
Gary Stevenson fans out there?
BANGER

co-worker music
I love this. Thank You very much for your soul. It's inspiration for me and my world Ren.
Fefinitely❤
one of the realest songs i have ever heard . KUDOS to you brother❤
Goosebumps 🤩
Clever song
One day Money Game 4 will be released. Only chance to hear it will be live... As the world falls into unimaginable turmoil, Ren busking on an irradiated guitar will be a tale passed down, and written into a book. A good book may I say... THE good book. The Holy Scriptures of Ren, passed down and reinterpreted to hopefully lead to a brighter future for the next civilization. People will question whether he ever existed, people will question whether he's from this planet... All they'll have are sticks and stones... and BARS... The remnants of humanity will gather these BARS, compile them, and hence..... The next holy scripture shall lead the next iteration of humans towards the future. They will strive forth following the gospel of Saint Ren and the Holy BARble 🙏
@RenMakesMusic This is music, this is poetry, this is art! Need I say more? I found this after watching fire in the booth 🔥🫶
hi
I've been "Canceled" since before the PLANDEMIC, they [Globalists, Deep State, Bankster Jews] don't want the TRUTH out there, "X" will not even allow me... This Movie was a warning from 2008 and there are many more... https://youtu.be/nBuZOX5-j9U?si=NIk-xM7DHzO_BGia GOD Bless ALL the Patriots in the World and NOT any like this POS [Person of Satan] John Roads from the movie...  PS it cost me my company and online Church, just sayin... Oh, "Big Pharma" drug dealers kicked me out of all their clinics for NOT wearing a mask, at the time I was on 14 drugs, that they cut me off of, DT's sucked worse than coming off-street drugs, and alcohol... GOD Bless you, Brother....
énormément aimé 👍👍 La musique, les paroles, l'histoire, les changement d'ambiance et d'instrument, ... un des meilleurs sons que tu ais fait REN ! 💪💪 Et le clip : très très réussi ! 😎
This is what i call modern art❤‍🔥

That’s intense and real at the same time
Story of Elon Musks life
You smart, smart man!❤️
This guy is simply a genius mastermind! I was sitting in the car when I heard this and I had to stop applaude and  bow before this talent.
All the flaws of life follow us. Recommend we address and try to no avail..... move on and grow further. Hope we do not tarnish the future gens with our faults and mostly with our acknowledgements to supercede the pain... the pain we feel that consumes us. So the children upon can avoid these types of abuses. To live on. To live on in a passion that can later be fashioned into the norm of a reality.that can speak of flattery fortuitous in galore. Not demise and compromise the self that feels whored, broken down and hopeless rifts inevitably broken. The voices that rise us up from the broken self. That we been consumed upon bitter wealth.. upon our own health.
Call me crazy but these realities will be the longest acclaimed hits that we hold dearest
The proletarians of this world have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to gain. Proletarians of all countries, unite!
This NEEDS to blow up!
this song is 10/10
Okay, y'all were right... I wasn't ready! That was incredible. I see why this won awards!! Ren, you're amazing bro! Keep making masterpieces! Much love from USA!
Thank you.
Liebe
What is broken? And how can you find yourself if you've never lost your mind in the first place?
Such an epic masterpiece.
I found out about Ren from the explosion of Money Game part 2 as a meme. The "she sells sea shells on the sea shore" bit, for the ones who don't know. Once I actually understood the lyrics, there was no coming back: as I was a young teen, it helped me realise just to what extent our society has failed. How much humans have fucked up.  Money Game part 3 feels like some kind of epilogue for the development of this mindset. If part 2 was the lecture, part 3 is the final exam. All I've learnt, cemented forever inside my brain.  Ren is an artist, but art wasn't born as entertainment. It was born to teach a lesson, and he's an incredible example of that.
Nice video. Thank you.
Only words I think can describe this truth is masterpiece ✨❤️
Genius.
Holy shit! This is fucking POWERFUL! I just recently found out about you Ren.... and I am fucking HOOKED! I love the messages in your stories! <3
pls dont sell out
stop talking about the production ancd the talent  and listen to the message
high level art. This is an astonishing accomplishment for all involved.
He talking about Elon?
y es
Man we are cooked,im gotbtry make people notice what's happening
I think Ren could actually take on Trump
5:54 is so anjelical it almost made me shead a tear
How old was the Elon Musk 🤔🤔?
The best story teller in UK
Art
Its a Silent Hill OST in a background( Piano)? :)
To powinien usłyszeć każdy i młody i starszy człowiek
This is one of the most captivating music videos I’ve seen in years. The story line is so compelling it could easily inspire a full-length film. I was completely hypnotized while watching—eyes wide open, struggling not to blink for even a second. Ren is not only a musical genius but also a phenomenal actor, blending artistry and storytelling seamlessly
1:39 gives me major Tommy Shelby vibes
Oi ! my dad rest in peace , i dont know why this song 😞 My dad was my hero and he tell good ideas but i was mess  up... i never could say thank you dad . He help me and i was f***king asshole then he die 😥 i was 33years old then. Now i sit in graveyard and cry ... Thank you dad and im sorry Hey iḿ sorry and i loveyou❤ This is real life .. OMG @REN .. this song , this hit me so hard and i cry here but life goes on. -Rokki T- 🇫🇮 ps. Ok i was like junkie in my twenties but now im sober but my mental healt not. Long term depression , maybe i deserved this . okay but life goes on. Wau what a song , i will survive
Mindblowing. Can't remember the last song that I sit in my car to listen to the end. For this one I did it. Masterpiece. Period.
Rich gotta realize that money must flow. Not all want lives of wealth and luxury. Many folks just want a clean, warm, safe, dry home. Good healthcare, get looked after with the taxes you give. Not giving said tax dollars to rich people. Time for the rich to pay their share or they might have that choice taken from them.
🔥
magnificent
with Tears i listen to your music
You should do something with Gary Stevenson
Ren bro, u r some1 else, and when the world figures U out, it will b 2 late, but we r happy we had these moments in life with U bro ✌️🫶🙏
The cinematography alone is insane!
😮
is that fking slenderma
This is beyond high school
...whoa!
Ren If your reading this are u Izavishi  by chance it's tayma
The piano. The filmwork. The vocals. The lyrical masterpiece. I've been following Ren for 6+ years and I cannot get enough. Hands down my favorite artist ever.
Holy shit I was just thinking about the “America was colonized by Britain” part of the first Money Game and I search it up and find a PART 3? And it’s 9 minutes long? This day just got 10x better.
IT WAS MORE THAN ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!!!!🎉💥💚
This is perfect
REN is a musical genius the level of story telling is so well
Yea I can relate to all of this.. Except the part where I kept wealth.. How I give away most sincerity things with such care I don't stick around long enough to continue to get paid.. I just look back at the old foot steps I once made, that I later lost in a haters traite, in my home state where I contemplate a better way to create something great that cannot be stolen..On this big rock that we all keep rolling, with many oceans of people with different brains and brain waves.. Sheep shaves and makes money if your a herder of game. David protected the flock with a rock, as he would often trade when the wolves would prey. He just blessed his good aim, with a quick halo above his head.. Slung it out with purpose to biblical verses that churches later say.. Only because the king had the prophets write it down right before they were slain..This life is worthless if curses pulled by herses don't push through the rain, to the dirt of the sane of one in the same. I hope you've heard of my name.. Its all a love game.. In this algarythemic mindframe of computers with many names that computerize what we see inside our lives as we count down our days. I give thanks, gratitude, with the right mental latitude as one that doesnt like to complain.. While driving myself crazy insane, for what I choose to not gain.. God gives me the music that I hear inside my lions golden mane of giants that science chooses to explain.. Its all 1 and the same.. I hope you enjoy the joy that also destroys the girls and boys with just toys as Angels hide the demons away in this frey of killers that reveal a hidden wheel of a carosell with lotsa colors in hell, we are all brothers as well. Just paying bills by the mail, or a click on a phone.. Sometimes my best music is when I lose my snooze alarm belling my ears in my home. Telling my mirrors to appear if they hear clear I always stand alone. Unless they rome to my band nearing a feeling spirit that cheer them I will call this my own and make them my friend.. Thank you ren.. -Your best friend you haven't met, Who was heaven sent to defend humans again..
Yesss!!!Force them to look at themselves and us at ourselves really look deep. We are not meant for this consuming. Chasing money for nothing. Oh you spoke to my soul sir I've been saying for years we aren't meant to live this way. I just want to be freeeee
Ren has been  feeding the beast inside the cage seems he has  tamed it some what and they almost have mutual respect for each other this is amazing and inspiring also
My bro can actually sing sick melody's aswell that stick to humans soul 😂
Bruh is this the story of Elon Musk 😅
ohhhh wow, this video is incredible.....goosebumps. Powerful message delivered with accuracy and emotion from Ren yet again. We all have questions to ask ourselves......😮‍💨
That perfect dap at 3:50
Just found...been reached.   It's been a long time.   May The High hang steady with this young one.  We need him...and for his own valuable sake.  All love from the US.
Jesus Christ.
that piano sounds so nice i love it :)
Masterpiece ❤
Amazing piece of work . Am blown away yet again . Thankyou
You amaze me with everyone of your songs. If you ever do a tour in Europe please come to Germany. I would love so see you live. Your Fire man just awsome. Keep it up.
Love the song and the video is so wicked. Fits the song so well. Spitting the true while showing the gruesome part of life. Kicked it bro
Ren... he did it again....!
How ironic, getting a Finance/Payday Loans ad on this video...
Incredibly good.
Impressive
this is so beautiful.
Musk but no revelation
#HiRen you are so unique, such a special talent that the earth has never seen before.  you are an ALIEN ❤️❤️❤️ as you say what you think and what no one else dares to say, or even if they dare, not nearly as brilliantly and creatively.  I bet you are the most creative artist ever to live on earth!  I hope we will hear from you for a long time and you will spoil us with your creations for a long time.  Be healthy and happy dear Ren
Incredible ❤
Elon? 😂 Lucky?!😂 AGENT 🍊
You have the facial expressions of an actor, maybe you should work in that direction?
really, dont much, but music..хотел выразить, но там пц по исполнению..
Is the piece of music played by the quartet at the end original or from something? I feel like I need to hear more of that. It’s so captivating
how ritualistic... could you chant more?
Truth!! 63 year old woman here and I can tell you without a doubt you are the most talented person I have ever seen!
Wow! Xxxxx❤
What a beautiful work of art. Meaningful, impactful and raw. As art should be.  Just. Amazing.
This might be the BEST music video ever made, camera work is out of this world, lyricality is thoughtful and life changing. This is underrated as fuck.
Is the first 30 seconds a master piano player, or just someone acting well?
Old school used to say : “When the going gets weird, the weird get going.” Essential, crucial, beautiful.
Come on keep it up ren
Oof. Goosebumps when you said spoke after saying “cut the music”  I understood what you mean. I think just like you. And idk why others don’t think like us
Great song. Great acting. So good. Message delivered.
He truly is a mastermind.
Classic 2025
Unreal 😮
so fucking good
Cadet levels bro 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Years ago I used to think there wouldn't ever be a better rapper/story teller than Eminem. You've surpassed him Ren. Time and time again.  Myself and my twelve year old granddaughter are absolutely addicted to seeing what you're bringing out next...doses of realism.....
Just found about ren on tiktok . I like any music as long as it is cleverly done and this ren is, u tell the story it your own unique way. well done . Amazing
Real men fight with fist you can't do that you fr..k i like your music your other side can we talk
Vini Vidi Amavi! Great work Ren. Hope to see you on your in America soon!
Leave me a like so I can come back to this
Masterpiece
Simply f-ing awesome 😎
REN you could’ve kissed the brick before throwing it at my face
Genius. Effin genius!
"If you manipulate the data then the lie will sell itself"  is an underrated line
I applaud to both of you 🙌🏻 This, THIS is the definition of ART itself. This masterpiece speaks directly to the soul and the visuals are so harsh and raw, yet touching and beautiful. I’m simply in awe of both of yours brilliant minds ❤️
Love that every song of Ren's is like a mixed media carnival with a message that truly hits. All very cleverly elucidated with more references than I can count (literally have to watch Knox every time to catch every bar) and the sickest beats.
🔥 untouchable, unfuckwithable.
Hated that it ended!
Ren is the Man... thank the ol' fuckery upstairs for this legend! Much ❤ brother
Damn if it doesn't resonate, what with the billionairebabyboys running amok these days, with a greed and a need that just never stops.
Listened to this song so much I can memorize and sing it without looking at lyrics I love his music at just 12 I look up to you ren great song!❤
5:58 another neat thing, the position of the chairs is a pentagon, referring to the shady business of the us government🔥
Just money future nope
Incredibly talented & a wonderful storyteller. However, I'm going to point out that utopia shouldn't be a goal. It's not achievable, so one who seeks it will always be disappointed. As long as we live in an open society of free thinking people, one person's idea of utopia will  never align with someone else's. In fact, the only way to perceive utopia would be to be the sheep & let someone else convince you that you're in a utopia. I'd rather have free thought & live in a messy world than be a sheep in a utopia. Just something to ponder.
Can.we talk about the absolutely wonderful actor Ren is? Please, come on, you are a genius ❤
Holy crap
Incredible.
I'd love this version to be on Spotify, it is so much more intense, coming from the inside 🎶 True work of art
He could totally play a young thomas Shelby
I absolutely love this song... listen to it on repeat on deezer.  Thank you so much. This song hits different.
This kid is incredible
Absolutely epic, highlighting the fact we are the cancer of the planet. Consumerism, greed and overconsumption are all man made issues, killing ourselves and the planet.
Totally amazing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tvezm62cMA
this is Art !!!
Thank you dude for all you do
Man I love your music. it gives massive The Joker rapping vibes for me.
This video is a masterpiece. Not just for the statements it makes but also the cinematography and choreography.
Should have done his homework
[Verse 1] Let me tell you a story about a man named Jimmy Forty-six, he should be dead, but the bullet missed him Doctors say he’s lucky, but his brain ain't the same He can’t move his left arm, and he can’t spell his name Forty-seven, in a hospital bed, just staring Paralyzed in half his body, thoughts incoherent Every word’s a mountain, every step is a dream A prisoner inside his skull, but his mind still screams  Forty-eight, he's got a nurse who don’t smile Tells him, "Muscles remember, but it’s gonna take a while." Forty-nine, every day is just a cycle of pain But deep inside his soul, something flickers in his brain Fifty, first words in a year, voice broken and slow He whispers, "Mine, mine, gimme," but it don’t feel like before It ain’t greed, it ain’t hunger, it’s the will to remain For the first time in his life, Jimmy’s fighting for change  (Beat picks up, slow drum build-up, like steps forming a path.)  [Verse 2] Fifty-one, out the chair, taking steps like a baby Fifty-two, speaking clearer, but the world still hazy Fifty-three, reading books that he never read before Learning history, philosophy, the art of war Fifty-four, haunted by the ghosts of his past The money, the power, all the lives that he trashed Fifty-five, starts to study, searching for a cause Ain’t got nothing left, but he's still got a war  Fifty-six, on a mission, finds a new way to fight Learns about the terror cells hidden deep outta sight Fifty-seven, ex-cartel, ex-senator ties Knows the networks, knows the players, sees the world through new eyes Fifty-eight, he sits down with a man in a suit FBI, black suits, war rooms and recruits Fifty-nine, "You built an empire, now you watch it decay So tell us, Jimmy, how you plan to make it okay?"  (Beat intensifies, tension builds, like a choice is being made.)  [Verse 3] Sixty, Jimmy breathes, then he closes his eyes He says, "I know where the bodies are buried, where the secrets lie." Sixty-one, a deal’s made, but his life ain't his He’s a tool for the state now, cleaning up his own sins Sixty-two, working deep inside the belly of beasts Hunting names, tracking funds, pulling threads in the East Sixty-three, finds a lead, something bigger than drugs A power moving in the shadows, selling death by the tons  Sixty-four, one more chance, one more game to be played But this ain't about money, this about who gets saved Sixty-five, Jimmy looks in the mirror, don’t see the same face But he sees a man fighting for something, not just running a race For the first time in his life, he ain't chasing the gold He's chasing something greater—he's just trying to atone  (Music slows down, haunting melody, lingering echoes.)  [Verse 4] Sixty-seven, new suit, same ghosts, different war He’s still moving numbers, but they mean something more Sixty-eight, through the wires, through the coded disguise Follows paper trails hidden under gold-plated lies Sixty-nine, another name, another ledger to burn A kingpin in the making with a fortune to turn Seventy, a meeting in the docks, hands shaking in dark Money changing, power shifting, just a spark to a spark  Seventy-one, he ain't there, but his echoes remain In the feeds, in the signals, in the whispering chains Seventy-two, static hums in his earpiece slow "Move in now," and the wolves let go  (Beat builds, low rumble, like a storm rolling in.)  [Verse 5] Seventy-three, a convoy splits the midnight air Heavy doors kicked open, boots flood the lair Seventy-four, sirens wail, deals collapse into dust A network built on silence now shatters to rust Seventy-five, hands up, but it’s bigger than this A thousand schemes folded in a singular twist Seventy-six, offshore accounts locked, names exposed He ain't pressing the metal, but he’s the one who composed  Seventy-seven, power shifts, and the cycle distorts One kingdom dies, but another is born Seventy-eight, watching figures through the thermal display He knows the rules ain't changed—just a different way to play  (Beat intensifies, sharper, relentless.)  [Verse 6] Seventy-nine, the dust settles, a briefcase left shut Inside, decades of secrets that were never enough Eighty, his reflection in the monitor glow A king with no kingdom, a past he can’t own Eighty-one, fingers hover on the final command One press, one move, whole empires disband  Eighty-two, the reports hit the air, the world shifts again Old names erased, but new ones step in Eighty-three, no more masks, no more fortune or fame But he pulls on the trigger of a money game.  too optimistic?
wow
MrBeast should watch this 💀
Masterpiece
Kennedy said. We need the poets.   This is the poetry we need now.
From the Bronx/Yonkers New York: This is absolutely amazing!!! ❤
Gave me chills!
brill
<3
Wow Brother I cannot believe I had never heard of you! Your brilliant Brother, keep on telling them how it is. Never bend the knee, no amount of money is worth it. Love from California!
Unbelievable good! First video ive seen from that dude. Allready got me...looking for all his work in you tube and other media now. Great....i have to say that again. I am really impressed!!!
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
FUCKING BRAVO! POETRY!!!
Came here cause of a friend. Gotta say, this is a masterpiece. The hypnotizing piano in the beginning, the slow offtune descent into the song, the pause, and the story were all perfectly executed. Well done.
i had to watch all of their songs the world wasn't hopeless enough
Absolutely incredible 🔥
Wake up people and wake up the ones around you ..for a better future😊
how on earth is this guy so underrated. My god this gave me the chills. Ren man I love your songs. You are undoubtably one of the best out there. Man, you are a genius lots of love from India
You are brilliant
I wish more americans would listen to this trilogy and find some meaning into it after all what happened in the last few weeks. I weep for what was once just criticism to become reality. It's such.. a... shaeaeaeaaaame!
I hope my kids have learn to not boast. Learn to be free. Learn to forgive. Know that I'll always be there. I never walked away. They were taken from me.
😢
I  would really like to say something  my baby's where taken from me cuz of the money game
Who cares what he’s wearing, I’d be oh so happy to watch him naked, playing and singing, he is this best thing that’s touched my soul musically and mentally for decades, love your own songs and Chinchilla’s dramatic face and talons, she’s brilliant bud. And by the way if REN comes from Wales, lived in England and gathered more and more success before hitting the states be interested in your presidents, for fk sake, r u daft? Uv got a megalomaniac in charge so no respect warranted. Love from Scotland.
How can we fix this Ren, how can we put an end to this money game, every year it gets worse, i don't know how far i can go, i see everywhere people like me that want to fix this world but the system was made to be unfair, i can't accept to live my life while some idiots who run the world have no morales, i can't take it anymore, crying everyday listening to all 3 parts of money game realizing how right you are, realizing i'm not the only one suffering, but yet here we are in an unfair world run by parasites, i'm only 19 i shouldn't think about ending it, i should have fun and make good memories but i can't, and a psychologist can't help, he can't fix the system, because money is the root of our problems, tho we've gone so far that no one would think about removing it, but everyday i'm reminded that i need to work 6 days a week on a job i hate, like my parents, and that's IF i get a job... love is the only thing keeping me alive, love for my girlfriend, love for my family and my friends but love is not enough to pay the bills. I'm tired.
Yet, we’re the crazy ones!😂
8:48 "With a .45 Caliber aimed at his brain" The way your voice breaks during this,  it's fuelled by pure emotion and genuinely makes my eyes water every time I hear it.
Just found Ren, from Money Game 1 to 3, masterpiece! Love it! Great music and videos! Wish you guys the best and don't loose your ways!🤜🤛
WWG1WGA WW     Q.
Cillian Murphy is that your son??!!
This makes me want to open multiple accounts with Google just to subscribe to him.. it's Total TRUTH!!😮
🌻❤️
Can I get a cut of just that piano intro separate
What a great storyteller!!!!!
Si j'aurais eu la chance,yaurai eu beaucoup d'enfants autour de ma table
Ren is a genius. Kujo the highwayman has tried to gaslight him and his lawyers are just trying to illegally steal his money with falsification,lies and bully boy threats. It's disgusting and completely illegal ,Ren could take them all to court and have the lawyers etc up in front of the professional standards board. Kujo and girlfriend are just absolute liars who are simply trying to steal money and cover up the theft of a sample by Kujo used in the best Ten bought on a full license,any court would throw the whole thing out and find in Rens favour. They are just corrupt,lying conmen trying to gaslight a poorly lad who works so hard and is a genuinely nice guy and gas tried to be very very fair. Ren good man no doubt, the others scum.
His voice and set up is sooo goooooooddddddd🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is art
Mr. Shelby is a rapper in this time.
Bitter SymTrueeee
😢
❤
Is it about Musk or JD Vance or?...
The Acapella was beautiful
This the most creative man I’ve seen on the internet so far🙌🏽
Dam this is so amazing music i am listening in 2025/marh4
Ren always gives me chills. Absolutely phenomenal.
Wow , this man's a poet!
You have a beautiful voice
I love this so much thank you Ren ❤
Sounds like Hamilton musical😂
That sing was perfection 😊
DIFFERENT LEVEL RIGHT HERE.    ❤🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Life is full of twists and turns Some are pleasant some are not If I have to be someone  The best of me then I will be And if I have to change the world  First to change will be my self  Yeah Yeah me Doorskey  I Am Doors by name and Key by Reputation 😊😊❤ Kiss this comment with Love
This is real music. It has a reason to exist. It isn't about love it's about the problems of this world. These songs have become some of my favorite songs ever. Thank you for making what can only be described as a masterpiece in music.
REN the World EYE OPENER 💥💯💥
A brilliant star in the darkness that is 2025 ✨️
Fucking great!!
Wow most wow. I'm 57 and this artist has blown me away. I'm a simple past middle aged woman who totally relates to this piece of complete art. Thank you and don't ever stop.
This is art. ❤
Daym
We have something he is calling him trup
The bard.❤
That's how it's done Ren. Thank You
W
Deep 💥🔥💚
Someone escaped my home. He jumped out from under something and hit the nurse. Tell me, is the courtyard how I remember it? No pets
What can I say about this talented young man that hasn’t already been said? Ren is a storyteller and can bring it all to life in song. His talent has amazed me. xx
Stay up never down you!!!!!!!
Whatever lol
@ren
wow just brilliant, your poetry your music, everyone should here this as money does not bring you happiness, you  will be remembered long after your gone
U remind me of myself SO HARD
This has to be one of the greatest bits of theatre I've ever consumed.
This is what a masterpiece sounds and looks like
My loved one met mi with your music. This is a reason to share life with other people!
Not sure if I heard it right but when Jimmy was 1 it was “mine mine gimme,” but when he was 40 it was “mine mine give me.” Might seem small but attention to detail like that when painting the picture of a man’s life and what he’d actually say is brilliant.
You are such an intelligent, artistic and true young man! X
This gives immortal technique vibes lol
Wow
I believe in u red flag, I always here for u , just ask ❤️
Ren literally shows us The Input The Process & The Output of Having the wrong ideals growing up💯
Agree with 100% of this. Beyond thrilled to know that there are others that feel the exact same way <3
this guy is a genius!
goddammit ren, take easy, this is ducking incredible
This is art. Fuck the bs that goes around these days , when I think of art I now think of Ren.
This is 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Mind blowing! 😮😮 he lives every word!
Extra ordinary intelligent. Strong emotional fact words!❤❤❤
Proper Bard
Another spectacular example of talent. So much talent. So many styles. Proper.  Needs a gunshot at the end man. I’m sure Rens got a reason for it not being there.  Just saying 😂
Super natürlich..... ehrlich.... Wahrheit... Realität.... Humanitär.... Cool
🤌❤
My dad was head of the air force in Australia. Had trouble with ptsd. I was lift in the dirt to survive. But Life teaches you things people can't. We moved when I was eight. I'm still following being be free. They all dead now.
❤❤
Nice, nice nice...
It's crazy this sounds like Trump right now it's sad
NO WONDER I LOVE  🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 SO MUCH!!
I love you wren this is you, the 99, Kristen n. Logan Tulsa ok 2025 on someone else's phone
🔥
Hell yeah
❤
Still one of the best songs ever written!
45, huuh... I like it.
YOU ARE INCREDIBLE, so well done!
Amazing✨🔥
Wow!
What a talent this man has !
Man, you are a genius, please never listen to the bad words. There are fewer and fewer people like you. You will remain in History...
Good job mate. Beautiful...
Oooh rain rain rain rain...
Rich is a life of love, memories, empathy, give and take equally, nothing in excess, no desire for control. Poor- thinking material gains and paper with ink and power is going to make you happy but it just breeds more and more hate violence and a huge empty void where a soul and heart used to be.
Wow
I found your music or should i say you're art work today 2/20/2025.  Let me just say it's amazing i know you know that it touches my soul in my opinion you are the greatest ever you sing life
It'd a Sam Vaknin video on self-trashing less and more.
Notice the Red tie?. Is it a coincidence the age of Jimmy and the pistol used is the number 45? Who was the 45th president of the united States?
I feel this song and the whole money game series. Love from Canada
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Absolutely love all 3 parts
This boy is a performance artist no doubt.
The camera was insane!! The music and lyrics were fire but I can't help but be amazed by the camera choreography
I'm watching the clip and for some reason I'm getting a Thomas Shelby analogy.
love the song but.... if his dad died when he was 35 (gets a call, im sorry hes gone), and then jimmy dies when he was 45 - the same age as his dad when he passed away, does that mean his dad was 10 years older than him? or am i missing something
Listening to this, looking at Elon Musk like…kettles are black init
Musical genius.. please remember that 🎉
Life is back pack in a back pack. Or a chest pack. Just brave it on. .. love ya ren.
fucking wow.  I got turned on by Hi Ren a couple months ago.
This is Trump/Musk completely.  A couple man babies ripping apart the US so they can have power and all the money. We've got Nazi Germany 1933 here today on February 19, 2025 going on in the US. It's a complete shit show.
0:41 I suddenly feel like I'm about to have a bad time. Nice inclusion of the Megalovania meter there.
You wouldn't know what it's like to be a millionaire anyways.
Amazing
Tbh America NEEDS your process of thinking, we lack any motivation to think on our own. "don't let the trees distract you from the forest"  my people need guidance in such a politically divisive climate.. you cannot blame them, everything is fueled by fear mongering and blatant propaganda.   Ren, you aren't an American.. But, you can be an American Legend.  You want to be heard? You want to spread your vision?.. next 4 years america will be going threw a hell of a cultural shift.. Start learning american politics i.e. global economics..  TRUST this is normal operations, but this cultural shift will be once in our lifetime..   *Iron is hot, but who will strike first?*  brother THERE IS NOBODY WHO CAN DO REN LIKE REN BROTHER. OWN IT.   Politically i'm a socialist (left winger), BUT fundamentally i'm a traditional American.. SIMPLY MEANING I 10000000% neeed my right wing counter parts.. afterall if it was a pure left or pure right we'd be nothing.. 100%  Afterall have you seen left/right left alone w/o checks, balances, and a genuine counter.. brother BOTH are psychotic 100,000,000% (Yes, BOTH sides.)    point is when all this political tension falls we'll fall back into a more nuanced and insightive era...   anywho,  love your art brother.
You Are An Artist Ren.. holy shit. the fact i've been listening to your music for months yet I had absolutely no idea you made a part 3.  I literally can't think of a single artist who is as near as you to being *mainstream* that has a truly unwavering faith toward ART.. your vision, your sacrifices towards manifesting it. YOUR VISION. This is precisely art.  dont stop being you ren.. fr. your the last one standing brother.
ts FIREE
Just one word comes out from my mind, WOW. Big up from Italy
Renegade for Life! Support greatness! ❤
This video taught me to teach my kids something other than "mine, mine, gimme" as their first words.
Hey somebody send this to musk
Bro come back we need another song these are traumatising but addictive
This should be playing all over the place right now.
Chills
I love this ❤
Winning
Oh man... Grateful to have discovered you.
he is speaking truth i mean what would you do if you where in power i mean really in power not elected not selected really in power?
Money buys lies
This is masterpiece thank you Ren
We need more luigi
Thomoy sholboyy
Conor mc bio 😢
This kid... hes so.fucking good!
🔥
Let the people hear truth 🎯
Love
I'm searching every day, in fact at least once per hour about how I could get out of this money game. Cuz it's true y'all, by participating at this, we're prolonging the problem. Imagine ourselves later with that emptiness, or worse our childs. Every one of us should question ourselves. I question myself every day since I was 18, and I'm 26 now. My mind is and always has been a storm. Truth is, just stop it. Find a way. Learn survival skills. And if food is inaccessible, just go steal it from BIG businesses, not normal persons like you and me. If you get caught in a forest and they tell you that you can't be there (let's face it, EVERYTHING is splitted, owned by a person or a bank.), well by having no money they will take you to prison, with plenty of food and the necessities to live. There's not enough place for all of us to be incarcerated. That's my solution. ALWAYS help the person next to you. Let's make the world a better place. Keep that in mind and do it. I don't want chaos, but we NEED to change it. Try to see Capitalism and push it far... the further you can.. and you'll see there's an expiration date. Communism is not so much better. Share. When I talk to my grand parents, they always tell me how the world is becoming a effed up place, how much they're glad they won't be there to see what's coming. Don't be stupid like them. They did their choice, they built this world. Love you Ren, in fact I love you all ♥(Sorry for the possible mistakes, I speak French lol.).
Hi Ren, I see you. ❤
Wow
You're just fucking genius. What a concept ❤️ you are a true artist and for sure a good human being 🌹
Late to the party as always, but I am blown away by REN's music (the cinematography is awesome too) We need more art like this, that speaks truth to power and exposes the lunacy that is modern life, as opposed to the candy floss they'd have us consume. Thanks
Absolute masterpiece this is my favorite Ren song, this is absolutely beautiful
i cried all along ..part 1 ..part 2....and the third .makes me feel good in a way not being numb and still feel complexe emotions .. you are  brilliant ..genius ..deep . im.out of word
This hits different now
❤😮
Ren is my favourite rabbit hole! Just WOW ❤
This was wild. I started watching it, uneasy with a 9+ minute run time but trusting the process. When it slammed to black, I couldn't wrap my head around the fact 9 minutes had passed. The pacing and visual storytelling is unreal.
Ren, I'm 37 years a psychiatric nurse. I have no words.  I'm so happy that Brighton is your place  Go for it, you genius
I’m yet to hear a song I don’t love. I find myself humming one of them every day and I mean the entire day. You’re very talented mate 🎉
Hello sir Tommy Shelby ♠️🧳
Genius thru and thru
Heard a clip of Money Game 1 just the other day... now i am down the rabbit hole.  these songs are so relevant.  thank you.
This brought tears to my eyes
Absolute love to the crew!!!
🔥🔥🔥
BRAVO BRAVO❤
Garbage
Year late, but this is masterpiece
Hello Ren firstly let me apologise for. I think I have lived under the tree for many years for only in January 2025. Did I discover your music? I am 57 years old my wife is born and bred in Brighton but we now live in Portsmouth sadly we never got to see you perform either by yourself or with your wonderful band but you’re solo stuff now has touched me both mentally and spiritually I wish you nothing but good health firstly and as for success, I think you’re already the greatest artist out there You help so many people. In so many ways my wife is religious so we send all our prayers and I love to you your friends and your family stay strong and thank you.
Your music is just amazing... Your lyrics are the deepest and so bold! no other artist even slightly touches the uniqueness you have....Keep the art flowing!!
So tragic and so incredibly beautiful… thank you❤️
The guitarist from video switched to playing the piano ? But in a serious note this is absolutely BRILLIANT
Why did I discover you so late, how wonderful. I'm 50
What have I just watched.... Genius is an insult...
this hits diffrent after a year❤
is  jimmy called elon?
Shakespearean. Grimm.
This video makes it look like Tommy Shelby can rap
A really good, hard look in the mirror
❤
1st story sounds like he just wanted affermation from his father that he was enough because no one in this world tells men that they are enough.
So good ❤
The best song about life . This man is just … I can feel every sentence crazy
How the hell as this absolute masterpiece only got 240k comments??😮 Man's a genius ! I❤ Ren !!
Accurate Barron Trump History
Modern poet and wise man
Garbage😅
This guy is super talented any serve looks like the guy from peaky blinders haha
What I learned is that you need to earn MORE money so that you can repair your legs if a cartel shoots you.
Ohh my God what a movieee
I love these singing, storytelling bits he does... Just pure entertainment and pure genius! And this is no exception! This is damn beautiful!
I don’t know how many times I have to say this. Ren is a fucking genius, and this is truly stunning.
All three parts of this song sum up everything fundamentally wrong with capitalist societies so well.
pure MASTERPIECE !!!!! <3
Thank you Ren.
Just don’t know - is he a rapper, musician, pouet, filmmaker or just multitalant?…
I love it .. but ut does remind me of system of a down
Mad skills. 90's term but very apt. Keep on...
Hope the voices left ❤
So creative and thought provoking ❤💷💷💵💵💶💶
You know this song is amazing although I feel personally attacked  Growing up people always asked me how “I” got rich, I didn’t, I was just born
Nf and Eminem heard ren and knew they both had to retire
Hector Salamanka
Whew!!!! I just burned tons of calories.
God i have goosebumps
This should win an award for best music video
Just found this guy called ren. He is it. He just is. This is music. This is Art. This is criticism. And its beautiful.
2:12
bang
and thats west texas!
Maybe he is just a Ghost like me… Not a Monkey on this planet of the apes… Tortoise with a porpoise. Am I turtley enough for the turtle club? I have energico and high IQ. Bill Haley is my Cousin. GG grandpa Blind Ed Haley. Ambidextrous Gemini. Wanna be my friend?
From week your playlist works 16h a day 😂😂 great lyrics love it ❤❤
Its slenderman
My favorite production from you ❤
Maaaan!  This is a masterpiece👏 Wow🔥🔥
The truth is powerful despite illusions like money.  The truth is that some people are so poor that the only thing they really have is money.  Donate to research to detect and cure lymes disease early.  People who are sick need that money.
This is so fire
Just wow 🤩!!  Love schemes flows rhymes!!! Now YOU have some talented relatable and outstanding ideas in that head ;O
Could listen to t your songs all day on repeat !!!im still in awe … gotta be my fav artist right now zx

The beginning piano gives me chills

Sums up the life of every individual on earth. 10/10 song. Amazing! We usually dont comment on other peoples songs who have plenty of fame but this is a masterpiece that is stating the world we live in. Congrats Ren, you have opened the perspectivesd of a couple million people.
I suffer from cluster headaches 4 ,5 months a year I won't to end my life just to stop the pain screaming in pain for 4 hours a day and nothing available to help me
@elonmusk

To err is human
So talented
Ren. Jimmy. Jenny. You don't know what you've done to help the people who need you. Thank you. Don't stop. Please.
Don't let anyone stop your music
I could use more of that piano before the interruption.
Shortest 10 minutes of my life <3
Just remember to live for your life for yourself don't do things if it's to get the approval of someone else

Just tell me anybody is there a money game part 4 i want it so badly after i watched and listnened the first part i listnened to all other now i want to listen to part 4 please like my comment when part 4 comes
NPR's Tiny Desk. Period.
They are both geniuses. The stories Ren tells and the lyrics to tell them are so rare and vivid. It gives me chills. The video and camera work just brings it all together.
Yk Ren these songs really are your greatest works, I think you can always add to it and to give you some ideas please listen to the following songs; The Legend of John Henrys Hammer by Johnny Cash 16 Tons by Tennessee Ford (you could make a cool beat out of this one if you sampled it.) Take this Job and shove it by Johnny Paycheck Working Class Hero by John Lennon Give me some truth by John Lennon  I can see a Money Game Part 4 if you were to speak on overworking culture but how they want to replace us with machines needs to be discussed.   I love your work, I think you're great.
tommy shelby ?
Life's lessons portrayed perfectly ! I'm a 62 disabled war vet,outcast by wealthy family suffering PTSD from war, and your video's ring so many bells and help to process the darker shadows of my mind. Thank you.
As an American who did not vote for our current president. I really want to know if the age of Jimmy being 45 when he pulls the trigger if that’s a nod (or middle finger) at our 45th president? Makes sense to me, the 45th and he will destroy it all 🫣
I’m speechless 😶 💔
It's the eclipse we are amazing hey man Hi-5 if you ever see this
Bro taught my whole friend group of 17yr olds capitalism.
Lyricist of the absolute HIGHEST degree
A genius piece of art
There is no rapper that can fuck with this kat!!! Facts.
Rens illness has really held him back if sickboi was able to tour continuously without f×+king himself up he be selling out venues everywhere 🎉😊🇬🇧🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Ksos
You are a living piece of art
🫶
Making this with no cuts and one long take is crazy. I wish i could talk to this man, get inside his head a little bit
Still a W song
You have no idea how much I hate you right now ❤❤❤
No way that was ren playing the piano 😳 😐 🤣
You should collab w/ yungblud
A modern day bard. A lost art form meets a unique millennial
The artist that always delivers poetry in the purest, most sublime, and rawest form. This is something most of us can relate to. Keep on chasing your dreams. Ren, you are giving courage to the rest who follow the same path as you. Much love from Croatia.
Love the creative video, puts across some views people in this world need to see. Thankyou for sharing your video😊😁👍

Wow, this is really great!
Amazing and so sad
You look a lot like the main character in peaky blinders Tommy Shelby
@renmakesmusic bro please drop me a message 🎉 literally fecking trollingnyou these days tictok got shut down yesterday after 3 times a wrote your lyrics in my story ffs😅
Holy shit I'm in bits my mental health, my emotional state and my happy happy joy joy perogative

Wow 👏🏼
What a Masterpiece ! REN is a musical genius!!!
Hi
It’s like watching a movie. You’re a genius
Revenge is a dish best served within lyrics .
LOVE IT!
I Cryed When i Heared it
My GAWD! My gawd, my gawd, my gawd…  I could quote any and every comment written here and still not come close to expressing how I feel about this lot.  Ren, you and your team…just… BRILLIANT!!  Thank you!! THANK YOU!!! Wow… ❤
Make a full length film perhaps? Your story telling is another level.
🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🫶🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
This is true today and forever
As a psychologist, all I know is that Ren is against pharmaceutical companies because they do not allow us to distinguish between consciousness and unconsciousness. The rest is to project the trauma onto social decay in the conscious and unconscious. An incredible display style and our instinctive expressions
I can never watch the end cause after haering Ren's story I cant imagine a world without his music (: Love your Music!
this is actually Cinema 🚬🚬 bro came here to throw facts after facts
What a brilliant and beautiful human! Storytelling master. Bravo! We must protect Ren at all costs!!
I’ve lost count how many comments I’ve left, but every time this is still the greatest thing you can listen and watch right now. Without exception.
Like this comment if this was a hella masterpiece
I killed my dog. I got hungry 😭
Always poetic and we'll put together. Love it Ren!
Here in Canada, we're in crisis currently and your video helps me getting through that stress! Thank you!
You, Sir, are a one-of-a-kind talent of your generation.
This is a masterpiece.
Incredible Ren!
Genius ❤ Let’s hope this saves a few people x
Modern day Bard with talent dripping from every pore
Seeing everything for what it really is, is exhausting and it's all madness
The ad showing below the video as it plays is  "Temu: Shop like a billionaire". Oh, the irony.
Relevant now more than ever!
😎👍

Absolute cinema
I am happy to see this. This made me really happy. Thank you Ren.
💜 Ren - Reign = real royalty  The Career Guidance and Life mentor we need. Stay blessed King 🫂
Ren and Em can write together the GOAT song.
i get shivers by just hearing this.
The kind of artist we haven't had for decades. This is out of this world. The man is a superstar, and although I don't like blunt instruments like guns and rope, I've got to say the videos, although shocking, are great !!!  Big appreciation from me
DENY, DEFENSE, DEPOSE‼️‼️
I watch many Ren videos daily and let the ads run through and leave a comment for the algorithm. 😎👍 This is a free way to support our man Ren. 🤘😎🤘 Also press that like button. 💯
well, thanks for making me cry haha After losing my father to suicide and a few close friends and my cousin I can really relate to your music. As an actor I'd LOVE to work with you some day on something.
Holy moly bruh. Cant believe i just recently heard of Ren. Wow.
Is it just me or is the Audio of the Music Video a different one than in the Song on Spotify
Das ist soo unglaublich

Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy One years old and his first words were mine, mine gimme Two years old, he was walking, three years old, walking quickly Four years old, he was running around the pavements of his city Five years old, and his daddy told him, listen here son, you've got to learn to be a man A man he works for what he wants Six years old, and he's reading, writing, top of the bunch And when he's seven, his progression made him student number one Eight years old and he's praised for unusual grades Nine, his parents pay for private school to nurture the flame 10, 11, 12, 13, he ascends and ascends, his daddy tells him, son, money is the means to all ends 14 solving complex mathematic equations, at 15, IQ 150, still elevating 16 he develops complex software code that detects weaknesses in cyber security protocol  17, and he sells his vision, keeping the share, not yet an adult But he's practically a millionaire 18, and his daddy tells him now you're a man the world don't give a damn about you So take all that you can 19, he turns a profit, stocks and shares, invest in product 20, double down deposits 21, his income rockets 22, he learns that truth is just an obstacle to wealth If you manipulate the data, then the lie will sell itself 23, a life of luxury Crystal and cocaine 24, he makes the Forbes list, they're applauding his name 25, and his daddy told him, listen here, son, while you're sitting in the palace That don't mean that you won 26, his business shifts, he switches business to arms He's 27, dealing nuclear shells in Iran 28, inside the Senate, money bought him a seat He's 29, role of counsel in the president suite And now he's 30, his daddy says, you're losing the race You're just a servant to the king, not even in second place 31, a big maneuver for his daddy's approval Moving imports over borders from the exports out of Cuba 32, moving grams, growing kilo to tons He's 33, filling warehouses with powder and guns 34, turf war with nobody to stop it, blind eye from the Po po inside of his pocket  35, he gets a call, I'm sorry, son, but it's your father, had a heart attack I'm sorry, he's gone, 36, getting pissed off abusing this product 37, eyes glazed, disposition demonic 38, with a prostitute, a moment of passion Heating up the silver spoon and then chasing the dragon 39, getting reckless and hungry for power Daddy's words still driving him to kill him and devour He makes a move against the cartel, but the strategy's flawed They retaliate and leave him in the hospital ward A bullet buried in his vertebra, and one in his leg The doctor sighs and says, I don't think you'll be walking again, fuck  Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy He was 40 and he cursed the words mine, mine gimme 41, he wasn't walking, 42, not walking quickly, 43 Never running round the pavements of his city 44 inside a palace with a mountain of gold But those riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves Weighing heavy on his conscience is the value of gold, Lamborghini for a life Trading money for souls, Jimmy followed the code inside the land of the free Put your hand inside the cookie jar, take more than you need And his example is exaggerated versions of me, and it's a version of him And it's a version of she, and it's a version of you There's no escaping the blame, the way we live, it's parasitic Fuck the money and fame, cut the music  This isn't entertainment, this is real life, the way we live is lunacy, community it declines We're hyperpolarized, we're always fighting and we divide Truth is less important than the money that we designed? Money's an invention, politics from our invention, they all come from people's ideas Did I mention, border's an invention Law and order fuels the tension that leads to people killing each other My solution? Everything is subject to change We could build utopias if individuals were taught to use their brains But if we teach kids in schools to always be sheep and put themselves before the herd If there's more money for meat Then there's no future I see where the humans survive We're parasites inside the Petri dish, with cannibal mines Mold will grow upon the surface, then consumes 'til it dies And our fate could be the same without this story to the wise 45, Jimmy comes home out of the rain, soaking wet upon a wheelchair Drinking again, he has everything he wants, he has fortune and fame Such a fortunate fool with an unfortunate fate with a 45 caliber aimed at his brain 45, a fitting number because his age is the same Here's the words of his father, it's such a damn shame Then he presses on the trigger of a money game
I'll call them tomorrow.   I like the keyboard sound. I wish markets still used the keyboards it would help their hands. My hand hit a row of mailboxes, it was an accident.
My brother you are a genius!!!
This man is on another level musically, in so many ways. Genius. Gets your attention, his words have good deep meaning 👍
Bellissima produzione!

Leaving a comment for the algorithim
Ren nunca deixa de me impressionar.
What a story it was better than a movie
the fact that its not just a song . but its also teaching others by the way you taught me a great lesson
Dam...
I had been so lost in the song itself that I forgot it was apart of the Money Game trilogy, only to be brought right into it with the ending
❤❤❤❤1/19/25
This video is amazing.
Better than slim shady
Best song every day of the week in my opinion
Kids today don’t understand broadway plays like this they understand fake synthesizers and guys that can mumble about women cars 🚗 and lobster 🦞
What a story Jimmie his first words were mine mine gimmie.awesome story telling ren this is one of my favorites.

Would love to see this guy do a colab with nf
Leaving this comment so when someone likes I can watch this again.
Absolute poetry.
Ren!
Hi Ren. I hope you see this comment. Would you ever do a song with Shotty Horroh? I really think the two of you could make a real banger.
When will part 4 release ?
That was unexpected and fantastic.
Brilliant work
I get crazy chills at the end of all of Ren's story songs. EVERY SINGLE TIME. It doesn't matter how many times I listen to each song it creates a physical change in my body every time. The video and song together is just utterly, magnificently masterful.
Foda-se 💚
Masterpiece
Rens music speaks volumes
Ren is above music. This is ART. At its highest.
Love Ren. Genius! Those that are meant to will find him!
REN is a musical genius we can all agree on that. But let’s also appreciate the production behind all these videos, the camera work is out of this world !
Yes
I could imagine this song being played in between awards, but it would steal the show....
Love this one also!
There are levels. This is off scale. Intelligent. Confronting. Satirical. Honest. Raw. Unique. If music don’t work, acting will. An artist with no limits.
I am so fascinated with your music! My husband and I love your work! It’s amazing!
Fuck... This is the real art
Is like Lucifer is speaking through him.
Is he talking about Trump ?
<3
Militantly anti greed you once said , love it Ren 🤑🤑🤑
holy moly... i am amazed... i love your style. i dont know whats going on but every song i hear from you are total goosebumps. thank you for your art. i love it. greetings from germany
They say it's the devil that has the courage to tell the truth.
Amazing work and a true inspiration 🙌🏻 To people saying he needs to be protected, I understand your concern, he stepped into the game knowing about it. What we can do as audience is to protect & spread his idea and inspiration through us !! I hope you have a wonderful evening ahead 😇
Absolutely.... wow! No words to describe what i just witnessed. Truly a work of art.
Somehow this reminded of the Fall of House Usher tv series. Great show btw
i work as a nurse in a psychiatric residence and a collegue sent me the video Hi Ren and then in that exact moment i knew i had found a great artist  love all your song !!!
This is so well done. Masterful.
I just came back to this and now just realising that I listened to this when it released
i was poor to buy a ticket
This. THIS. THIIIIIIIIIIIIS
Feel like this should be the next bond theme
I love this so much
Part 4 When???
Try to collaborate with Iyah may "Karmageddon" ❤🎉
This is pure Genius
I do hope this song gets the recognition it deserves. Truly a masterpiece explaining the world today
Will wood type song
It’s 3am and I should sleep but oh god this is whole new obsession for me
Is it only me or do I see Cillian Murphy playing an older version of Ren in a video ? They look very alike!
Can you please write a rap musical, direct and star in it bc I'm pretty sure you will be the only one that can pull it off.
Class
MASTERPIECE
That was an experience. 👏
You must be famous because you got my music teacher playing this in lesson to us

Wow
Powerful.
Found out the first part through tiktok and watched each part, gotta say this is my favorite!
Peaky blinders vibes shit slap in California
Magnifique
That was truth just told
Ren has dozens of thought pieces. I'd like to call attention to this in the moment of "The Adjuster".   I dont have the balls to be Luigi, but I would never convict him.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😢❤
Did Ren really play those arpeggios at the very beginning? I think I need to know..
Wow 😳 🔥 🎻
I never comment, but Ren is the most undervalued artist I have ever seen. This is insane and I love it. So this ones for the algorithm
Wow ! That was Deep ✨

He is tuned in to something special 😮
This is great!

HE BLOWS MY MIND EVERY TIME
让我给你讲一个关于一个叫吉米的男孩的故事 1 岁，他的第一句话是我的，我的，给我 2 岁，他走路了，3 岁，走得很快 4 岁，他在城市的人行道上奔跑 5 岁，他爸爸告诉他，儿子，听着 你得学会做一个男人，一个为自己想要的东西而努力的男人 6 岁，他在阅读、写作方面名列前茅 7 岁的时候，他的进步使他成为学生第一名 8 岁，他因成绩优异而受到表扬 9 岁，他的父母为他支付私立学校的费用，以培养他的热情 10 11 12 13 他不断进步 他爸爸告诉他，儿子 金钱是实现一切目的的手段 14 解决复杂的数学方程式 15 智商 150 仍在提升 16 他开发了复杂的软件代码 可以检测网络安全协议中的弱点 17 他出售愿景并持有股份 虽然还不是成年人，但他几乎是一个百万富翁 18 他爸爸告诉他现在你是个男人了 这个世界根本不在乎你，所以拿走你能拿走的一切 19 他从股票和股份投资产品中获利 20 双倍存款 21 他的收入飙升 22 他了解到真相只是财富的障碍 如果你操纵数据，那么谎言就会不攻自破 23 奢侈的水晶和可卡因生活 24 他登上了福布斯榜单，人们都在为他的名字喝彩 25 他爸爸告诉他听我说，儿子 当你坐在你的宫殿里时，这并不意味着你赢了 26 业务转变，他转向军火业务 27 在伊朗交易核弹和炮弹 28 在塞内特的钱为他买了一个席位 29 总统顾问的角色，甜心 现在他 30 岁了，他爸爸说你输了比赛 你只是国王的仆人，甚至连第二名都排不上 31 为获得他爸爸的认可而采取的重大行动 搬家古巴出口的跨境进口 32 移动克，从公斤增加到吨 33 仓库里装满火药和枪支 34 无人阻止的地盘之争 口袋里的警察对他视而不见 35，他接到一个电话，对不起儿子 但是是你爸爸，心脏病发作，对不起他走了 36，生气并滥用他的产品 37，眼神呆滞，性情邪恶 38，与妓女激情一刻 加热银勺，然后追逐龙 39，变得鲁莽和渴望权力 爸爸的话仍然驱使他杀戮和吞噬 对卡特尔采取行动，但策略有缺陷 他们报复并把他留在病房里 一颗子弹埋在脊椎里，一颗在腿里 医生叹了口气说，我认为你不会再走路了  让我给你讲一个关于一个名叫吉米 他 40 岁，他咒骂着“我的，我的，给我”这些词 41 他没有走路 42，走得不快 43 从不绕着城市的人行道跑 44 在他的宫殿里，有一座金山 但当视角演变时，财富变成了废墟 沉重的负担是黄金的价值 一辆兰博基尼换一条命，用金钱换灵魂 但吉米在自由的国度里遵守着规则 把手伸进饼干罐里，拿走比你需要的多 他的例子是我的夸张版本 这是他的一个版本，也是她的一个版本 这是你的一个版本，无可逃避指责 我们的生活方式是寄生的，去他妈的金钱和名声 别听音乐了 这不是娱乐，这是现实生活 我们的生活方式是疯狂的，社区在衰落 极化——总是在战斗，然后我们分裂 真相不如我们拥有的金钱重要设计？  金钱是一种发明，政治来自我们的发明 它们都来自人们的想法 我有没有提到过 边界是我们的发明 法律和秩序加剧了紧张局势 导致人们互相残杀？我的解决方案  一切都会改变 如果每个人都学会使用自己的大脑，我们就能建立乌托邦 但如果我们在学校里教孩子们永远做绵羊 如果我有更多的钱，就把自己放在人民前面  那么我看不到未来，人类将无法生存 是培养皿里的寄生虫 有食人思想 霉菌在表面生长，直到它死去 我们的命运可能是一样的，所以这里有一个给聪明人的故事  45 吉米从雨中回家 湿透地坐在轮椅上，又开始喝酒 他想要的一切他都有财富和名望 他是一个幸运的傻瓜，但命运却不幸  45 口径的枪瞄准了他的大脑 45 是一个合适的数字，因为他的年龄相同 听到他父亲的话；“真可惜” 然后他扣动了金钱游戏的扳机

This level of storytelling.....🤌🙌
🔥🔥
This song perfectly represents my daydreams
Keep it up you are a genius,  sending love brother . To create is to touch divinity.
I know that this has probably been covered, or that I'll get a bunch of backlash for this opinion but please try and view this as a possibility and understand that I know the other more obvious views.   The dad isn't a bad or greedy person trying to instill in his son that he needs to make a lot of money. The entire time Jimmy misunderstands his father's words. Likely because men of older generations can be pretty bad about communicating what they actually mean. So let's break down possible boomer translation  Age 5 "listen here son, you've got to learn to be a man. A man he works for what he wants" This could be instilling a sense of responsibility and dedication to family. The traditional role of being a "man" is to be a strong provider and protector. He never says anything about money or material wants.  Age 9: parents pay for private school to give jimmy the best chance at having a good life that they can.  Age 18: "now you're a man, the world don't give a damn about you So take all that you can" Jimmy's dad could be trying to convey the harsh reality of life as an adult and trying to convey that you have to grasp onto the things that make you happy when you can because you may not get another opportunity. Again, nothing specifically mentioning money or material things.  Age 25: "listen here, son, while you're sitting in the palace That don't mean that you won"  I view this as Jimmy's dad seeing that greed has taken hold of him, and he's trying to convey that having all that money isn't going to make him happy in life.  Age 30: "you're losing the race You're just a servant to the king, not even in second place" I think this is again, Jimmy's dad trying to warn him that the path of greed is not going to make him happy in life. A servant to the king meaning, either a slave to money, or pointing out that he's just a cog in the political and economical corruption.  When looking at it this way, Jimmy's dad really wanted what was best for him and tried as well as he could to get him on the right path to a happy life. If Jimmy had just set aside his greed, then that's when his father would have been happy and approved of him. It's extremely sad that poor communication, especially from that generation, can cause such trauma to us.   Thanks for listening to my Ted talk.
Hey mate, I'm proper bipolar, need some help pleaae

I’m speechless as a musician myself. Gotta raise my bar. Tricky to tread that need to be popular and make art that defines an era
To any question...

The scarecrow is real and has a face! ;)

This is not a song. This is a lecture from a professor.
Money Kills!
when storytelling emphasizes truth , music hypnotizes soul
I just found you and I have to say, your story is so entrusting. Your music 🎶 is amazing. I had a stroke 3 years ago and lost some of my vision and I have 2 spost on my brain that are inoperable. I have severe headache and I have found music 🎶 helps me. Television is to much with all the lisghs and trying to read alot . To hard to keep up. Anyways, just wanted to thank you for your gift & sharing 💕 it. I really don't appreciate you. I'm a Holler Girl aka (Ryan Upchurch) but also I'm a Ren Girl to now. Thanks for the tunes Dude. Holler Gurl VA.  Boots On The Ground 👢 Angles On Your Pillow ✨️🌙🪶
When someone says that taylor swift is the best songwriter, show then this masterpiece.
An artistic soul wrenching truth for most of our internal feelings perfectly justified in a performance that is sour and sweet at the same time. Make the best and be the best u can❤
One of the best artist of ourtime
this is absolutely brilliant
5:52
When Joker mental meet a musician soul, sensational! 👏
Chefs kiss! Just simply amazing!!
Absolute masterpiece 👏❤
This chap is genius
A masterpiece... Wow
I rarely come/post here, but Ren's one of my exception because of all the work and meaning but in his lyrics and videos.  Congrats for taking music on another level and being among the few feeding this vibrating fire of Truth inside of us.
Could not look away from the screen. I was playing a game, and I left it to watch this. Damn this hits so deep that I can't explain.
Lowkey agree 100% this world is just built on lies greed and money and it’s sad
Low key that’s mad deep
Low key that’s mad deep
I want him to do more jazzy with his voice. I love the sound of it in the beginning before he switched to a more pop feel.
oh my god just discovered this creative genius from my neck of the woods too 🙂
Hi Ren, in my 52 years 3 artists have moved me to tears.   1. the The, Matt Johnsons lyrics have been some of the most moving to me in my journey from adolesence into adult life and I urge you to listen to him as you are in my opinion the modern day version of him.  2. Talk Talk, their music is immensly moving, well constructed and epic. Again this reminds me of your art.  3. You, your music, your art, your lyrics, they are superb. Your videos are just so good too and I cant believe your vocal talent let alone your ability to play multiple instruments. Keep being you, I love your art!!!!
Algorithm do your work
Wow, I see myself in this story, and I don't like it. Love the song, but reflection hurts when it's an unfiltered mirror, and the worst part is, I see no way to survive this world without that mindset.
My dad lives ren his fav song is hi ren ❤
I don't often find new Musicians that I respect and instantly love. Today i have found Ren. Humanity still has a lot of great things.<3
Real........   Talk.....
Masterpiece ❤

5:38 the only cut in the entire video?
[Verse 1] Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy 1 years old and his first words were "Mine, mine, gimme!" 2 years old he was walking, 3 years old walking quickly 4 years old he was running 'round the pavements of his city 5 years old and his daddy told him "Listen here, son You gotta learn to be a man, a man, he works for what he wants" 6 years old and he’s reading, writing, top of the bunch And when he's 7, his progression made him student number 1 8 years old and he’s praised for unusual grades 9, his parents pay for private school to nurturе the flame 10, 11, 12, 13, he ascеnds and ascends His daddy tells him "Son, money is the means to all ends" 14, solving complex mathematic equations At 15, IQ 150, still elevating 16, he develops complex software code That detects weaknesses in cyber security protocols 17, and he sells his vision keeping a share Not yet an adult, but he's practically a millionaire 18, and his daddy tells him "Now you're a man This world don't give a damn about you, so take all that you can" 19, he turns a profit stocks and shares invest in product 20, double-down deposits, 21, his income rockets 22, he learns that truth is just an obstacle to wealth If you manipulate the data, then a lie will sell itself 23, a life of luxury, crystal and cocaine 24, he makes the Forbes list, they're applauding his name 25, and his daddy tells him, "Listen here, son While you are sitting in that palace, that don't mean that you won" 26, a business shift, he switches business to arms He's 27, dealing nuclear and shells in Iran 28, inside the Senate money bought him a seat He's 29, a role of the council in the president's suite Now he’s 30, his daddy says "You're losing the race You're just a servant to the king, not even in second place" 31, a big maneuver for his daddy’s approval Moving imports over borders from the exports out of Cuba 32, moving grams, growing kilos to tonnes He's 33, filling warehouses with powder and guns 34, turf war with nobody to stop it Blind eye from the po-po inside of his pocket 35, he gets a call, "I'm sorry son It's your father, had a heart attack, I'm sorry, he’s gone" 36, getting pissed up, abusing his product 37, eyes glazed, disposition demonic 38, with a prostitute, a moment of passion Heating up a silver spoon and then chasing the dragon 39, getting reckless and hungry for power Daddy’s words still driving him to kill and devour He makes a move against the cartel, but the strategy's flawed They retaliate and leave him in a hospital ward A bullet buried in his vertebra and one in his leg The doctor sighs and says "I don’t think you’ll be walking again", fuck    KATSEYE 'My Way' Lyrics & Meaning | Genius Verified  [Verse 2] Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy He was 40, and he cursed the words "Mine, mine, gimme" 41, he wasn’t walking, 42, not walking quickly 43, never running 'round the pavements of his city 44 inside a palace with a mountain of gold But those riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves Weighing heavy on his conscience is the value of gold Lamborghini for a life, trading money for souls Jimmy followed the code inside the land of the free Put your hand inside the cookie jar, take more than you need And his example is exaggerated versions of me And it's a version of him, and it's a version of she And it's a version of you, there’s no escaping the blame The way we live is parasitic, fuck the money and fame! Cut the music!  [Verse 3] This isn’t entertainment, this is real-life The way we live is lunacy, community, it declines We're hyperpolarized, we're always fighting, and we divide Truth is less important than the money that we design? Money's an invention, politics from our invention They all come from peoples' ideas, did I mention? Borders? An invention, law, and order fuel the tension That leads to people killing each other.

Fire
Wow Thanks Ren
Does he makes a concert or a live shows ?
6:30 the melody 😭
masterpiece 🔥❤️
It's consummate, it's raw and it feels self-evident! 🙌✨️ Even when I don't know if it can get any better it just keeps evolving. I have never had an Idol in my life though I can esteem an artist for his or her work. Ren is the closest I've come to idolising someone since everything he does is golden ✨️ Love sent from Sweden 🇸🇪
This  video got me thinking more and that is why it's valuable for me Thanks
Fucking fantastic
Wow
LYRICS HERE: ⬇️⬇️  Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy One years old and his first words were mine, mine gimme Two years old, he was walking, three years old, walking quickly Four years old, he was running around the pavements of his city Five years old, and his daddy told him, listen here son, you've got to learn to be a man A man he works for what he wants Six years old, and he's reading, writing, top of the bunch And when he's seven, his progression made him student number one Eight years old and he's praised for unusual grades Nine, his parents pay for private school to nurture the flame 10, 11, 12, 13, he ascends and ascends, his daddy tells him, son, money is the means to all ends 14 solving complex mathematic equations, at 15, IQ 150, still elevating 16 he develops complex software code that detects weaknesses in cyber security protocol 17, and he sells his vision, keeping the share, not yet an adult But he's practically a millionaire 18, and his daddy tells him now you're a man the world don't give a damn about you So take all that you can 19, he turns a profit, stocks and shares, invest in product 20, double down deposits 21, his income rockets 22, he learns that truth is just an obstacle to wealth If you manipulate the data, then the lie will sell itself 23, a life of luxury Crystal and cocaine 24, he makes the Forbes list, they're applauding his name 25, and his daddy told him, listen here, son, while you're sitting in the palace That don't mean that you won 26, his business shifts, he switches business to arms He's 27, dealing nuclear shells in Iran 28, inside the Senate, money bought him a seat He's 29, role of counsel in the president suite And now he's 30, his daddy says, you're losing the race You're just a servant to the king, not even in second place 31, a big maneuver for his daddy's approval Moving imports over borders from the exports out of Cuba 32, moving grams, growing kilo to tons He's 33, filling warehouses with powder and guns 34, turf war with nobody to stop it, blind eye from the Po po inside of his pocket 35, he gets a call, I'm sorry, son, but it's your father, had a heart attack I'm sorry, he's gone, 36, getting pissed off abusing this product 37, eyes glazed, disposition demonic 38, with a prostitute, a moment of passion Heating up the silver spoon and then chasing the dragon 39, getting reckless and hungry for power Daddy's words still driving him to kill him and devour He makes a move against the cartel, but the strategy's flawed They retaliate and leave him in the hospital ward A bullet buried in his vertebra, and one in his leg The doctor sighs and says, I don't think you'll be walking again, fuck Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy He was 40 and he cursed the words mine, mine gimme 41, he wasn't walking, 42, not walking quickly, 43 Never running round the pavements of his city 44 inside a palace with a mountain of gold But those riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves Weighing heavy on his conscience is the value of gold, Lamborghini for a life Trading money for souls, Jimmy followed the code inside the land of the free Put your hand inside the cookie jar, take more than you need And his example is exaggerated versions of me, and it's a version of him And it's a version of she, and it's a version of you There's no escaping the blame, the way we live, it's parasitic Fuck the money and fame, cut the music This isn't entertainment, this is real life, the way we live is lunacy, community it declines We're hyperpolarized, we're always fighting and we divide Truth is less important than the money that we designed? Money's an invention, politics from our invention, they all come from people's ideas Did I mention, border's an invention Law and order fuels the tension that leads to people killing each other My solution? Everything is subject to change We could build utopias if individuals were taught to use their brains But if we teach kids in schools to always be sheep and put themselves before the herd If there's more money for meat Then there's no future I see where the humans survive We're parasites inside the Petri dish, with cannibal mines Mold will grow upon the surface, then consumes 'til it dies And our fate could be the same without this story to the wise 45, Jimmy comes home out of the rain, soaking wet upon a wheelchair Drinking again, he has everything he wants, he has fortune and fame Such a fortunate fool with an unfortunate fate with a 45 caliber aimed at his brain 45, a fitting number because his age is the same Here's the words of his father, it's such a damn shame Then he presses on the trigger of a money game
It took me waaaaaayyy too long to find Ren. His music is genius it connects intellectually emotionally and viscerally. Sir please continue creating the world may not deserve your talent but it deeply needs it and your message/perspective. Thank you for sharing yourself with the world
thats incredible huge respect, listening from Brazil
Back again to watch this masterpiece.  Glad to see that YT caught on to my love with your style
DAYUM !!!
Masterpiece of a record... What an artist
This is a 💎
Art ❤
Masterpiece thats a word that i can say after hearing this
✨ A true masterpiece ✨
Wow master piece 👏
🤯
He's just so amazing 😫
❤
My algorithm is goated
Damn
This song has a strong message
absolute masterpiece of storytelling
So when he takes of the mask from his face, is it supposed to be Jimmy's birth?
Honestly don't have any words toh appreciate you brother. This is a f*** masterpiece..
Fkk man🖤
This is fantastic
👏👏👏
Bro wtf is this , i got here from a reel with little expectations but o my fucking god , keep going brother
Modern day bard i guess.
Let him cook! I said let him cook !!!
No waaay! This guy is a genius!!!!
Jimmy's a shame
Definitely Ren should perform musical on stage!
Wow just wow. Money game huh
For Algorithm
Didn't expect to find this today. But I am f***ing glad I did
Perfection
One of the best pieces of storytelling ever produced
💕✨
Only change is dragons instead of dragon.  Materpiece.
For a moment I really thought it was a loaded gun... what a masterpiece
Man this just feeds my biggest fear. The fear of achieving everything I want and yet still end up unhappy.
This is so deep 😢 fucking broke me
takes him 5 years to start singing
Damn i didn’t feel it’s 9min
sigma boy
This guy reminds me about some guy named luigi magione
Thank you Ren ❤. As an American 45 is indeed a horrible number.
Marry me. Jason Thomas bray
Ren you do restore my faith in human nature, greed is evil, the world could be a better place without it. I'm 63 years old and happy with the little I have because my little compared to many is a lot. Bless you boi, keep it real 👍
You really should join with #Hi-rez from the USA❤❤❤
Ren this one of the greatest performances ive ever seen.  Thank you so much!!!  You and i are so similar in our circumstances. I have lyme, am ADHD and have MCAS. also this money game of this world has never made sense to me and have rejected it my whole life. Your work is brilliant and inspires me to speak out as well on all topics fore mentioned. Love and best wishes to you!
So impressed
just wow
3:52 i just realized that in money part 2, he talked about getting rich by selling shells and how you can expand to other products like oil, and here, you can see jimmy manipulates the truth to sell shells. (btw, shell is the name of an oil and gas company. coincidence?)
❤beautiful❤ keep it up ren real music lovers fuck with you heavy
(before i start this comment i wanna say i love this song sm and the way it was recorded and everything is rlly cool and i regret not finding you sooner LOL)  the ending reminds me so much of that one poem Richard Cory honestly, he had everything he could ever wanted and yet it all came down to that. its a really unique way of showing how things are today. i rlly love it. keep up the amazing work. >:P
Only 8.3 million views is evidence of the power of censor$hiP .. Likely because IF The Truth were allowed to reach the MA$$es about this Game of the Bank$ers IT would cease in a short time .. Much Respect my Friend.. men like You can change this $hit$how when They make up their Minds and embrace the Truth or that Money is the cause of all our collective woes because IT is Bigger than Man.
This is art
The stuff you make is profound, but heavy. Thank you, this is what art is for. Not mindless entertainment, but a mirror to reality.
I'm in America and just came across this guy after hearing Russel Crow say he has caught his attention and needs to get him out there
Sick!
A TRUE MASTERPIECE!!!!!!!!!
This is just insane! I cant understand how you come up with the whole idea and concept.   The composition, idea and switches in music are  crazy.  Thats my 3rd favourite after Hi Ren and the Violets trilogy
THIS IS ART
ur a genius (impregnate me)
So freakin talented!!❤
here cuz of luigi
bruh, that weapon prop supervisor was on point
Damn
1:14 That piano 🔥🔥
Ren gg, montage director the graetest
for lack of better words, this is the best musical video ever created
So siccccc...freaking dope shit!!
I don't think I've seen an artist in front of the camera and a craftsman behind it spread such deep admiration to such a varied diaspora of people at a time when people are seeing through bullshit like never before and in times when people are so fractured with the tensions in our countries and others it's great to read the comments of people of all ages tell their story, age and collective admiration for a semblance of artistic truth.  I'm just going to say a simple thank you to Ren and Sam, many of us use these platforms to escape or vent, with these pieces of audio and visuals people connect and concur with each other.  Cheers lads
😭😢😭😢😭
2:12
Duuuude! That explodes in my mind every time I am listetning to it.
Not all of us are awful Ren. Some of us still give when we have nothing.  Have faith.
THIS IS ‘ART’! Phenomenal! Thank you Ren!
Wow. This song hit home. My dad said some very similar things to me growing up. Messed me up pretty bad for a while to luckily I saw at a young age just how quickly life can end and how death didn't care how old you were or how good of a person you were or how many people loved you or counted on you that it took indiscriminately and viciously and no one knows if it's their time in the very next moments that for all I know I could draw my last breath and never finish this comment. Unfortunately learn to say how I felt about the people I cared about well I have a chance and to try to live my life to my own standards and help when I can for who I could not expecting anything in return. To love the girl I love look like it's always my last night on earth or hers so when I am gone no one will have to wonder how I felt if I love them because I showed them everyday. I'm not trying to sound pretentious or say that my life is better than anyone else's because I've made it fuck tons of mistakes but I did it that's myself the good the bad,  the laughter, the Heartbreak,  the pain and anger from loss, the love..the joy, fear, depression and emotion in between...The horrible grammar in this comment...the life I have lived.    The credit and the blame are mine alone. I don't guess I really have a Epic life changing point to all this. Just be who you are and make sure the people you love know you love them. Ren, you are an amazing artist. Keep speaking from within.   "Be safe, be kind, and know that you, are appreciated." WF
Was reasonably on-time to Money Game pt. 2, at least after the Luigi seashells meme started but I'm so mad I had NO clue this existed till a full year after release. Algorithm definitely failed me on that one, but now I'm here and I just gotta say, WOW.
Free Luigi
Du bist ein Vorbild für jeden der psychisch im arsch ist...
The lyrics finally start at about 2:12
You deserve all the love Ren. With your words, your art...you let look everyone in the mirror and let them think about this sick money world. And yes...I think you are a piece of creating a better world with less money and more love with your music. You are healing us and yourself with your art. thank you
just found this kid today and gotta say he deserves the world and more for his dreams to come true as hes truely gifted
Absolutely genius
Becon of hope
yall saw the beginning of the piano?? piano man really knows true peak OSTS (NMTB)🗣️🗣️
This song gives me chill bumps all over.
Damn, what can't Cillian Murphy do?
This si a Pop-Rap opera  Tommy was a pop rock opera chapeau
I will meet you one day.  Trust
REN JUICE WRLD WAS MY LEGEND AND NOW ITS BOTH OF YOU😢🎉
Epic fucking genius.
I put this on my pc n was looking at my phone with it playing in background n after a minute or two I focused in on it n listened but still distracted. After 5 or 6 minutes I REALLY LISTENED n thought FUXK n put it back to beginning n watched n listened intently. I was fuxkin blowin away n when it got to the end I started cryin. Every word n the way Ren presented it n the video n the profound truth of his words touched me in the pits of my soul. I am a new Ren follower n saved every production he has made (yes they are productions) to a playlist called REN A FUCKIN LEGEND!!!!! I watched this on repeat for 10 or so times. Ren n his writing skills a just astounding. I've been down the rabbit hole n heard them all. He is a FUCKIN GENIUS!!!!!
I read a comment somewhere that someone should work with Ren to produce a show. Christ if Hamilton can do well lol! His music is original and every song has a deep and meaningful message. He's an artistic angel and I really wish that there could be such a collaboration. I would shout it from the rooftops that everyone needs to go and see it!
I say this because I love the music and Ren is absolutely right.  But if you are listed by Forbes.  You are either to big to be stopped or just made a major mistake. It is amazing to me the world is not on fire.  UN2030 is the biggest existential threat to all but the very upper class in terms of wealth down. Surprises coming to many of those that think that they are. Yet, nothing. Incredible. The anti hero here, is self destructive. Don't do that. That is exactly what those in power want.  Fight back with all your might. You would be surprised what you can achieve. THIS is what corporate globalists fear. The same people backing the likes of, Keir Starmer, Justin Trudeau, Emmanuel Macron.  All of those that want to undermine nations and take total control of the lives of ordinary people to the point that you no longer even have bodily autonomy. The liars, cheats and crooks in power.
Good performance, exemplary.
This guy. Sometimes, in our livetimes, a person comes around who shows what real talent is. Not only does he have his finger firmly on the pulse of humanity, his gift also allows him to tell the story in a way that's never been done before. In this world of overproduced "artists", Ren is a flickering candle in the darkness. Thank you for sharing your gift with us.
Wauuuu 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Ren you are amazing, thank you❤
🍀BOSTON🍀
I'm me, I'm not someone
Just discovered your music today and I haven't stopped listening, keep up the good work man. It just clicks man, a morbidly beautiful image of our present you put into words.
It is not possible for me to like any song or artist more than this! I find most things are so predictable. i love how unpredictable this music is. Super novel and brilliant
Money Game anything REN sells or shows prices will soar!
¿Alguien más vino por que lo recomendó el rifle @franco_escamilla ?

So I'm getting from the lyrics he's a blueanon Simp OK
Wow. Just wow.
♥
It's about time for a revolution.... WIth intentions not weapons. Empathy not apathy. Truth as reality not individual insanity...
❤❤❤😢
I'm to old to have ever used the term I'm about to but here it goes.  Bro!
who makes 9 minute music videos, NO ONE but this dude said fuck it
just watched the other parts rught before. what a masterpiece of art.
Fuck.  Art, truly.
deny defend depose
Its like a rap opera ❤ so amazing.  I love your piano. I have so much to catch up on. I love everything you do
PHENOMENAL! Thank you Ren!
Just wonderful.
It fells like an movie😮
Як же круто знято одним кадром і до тексту пісні додати нема чого... Браво!
Maan ooo Man
This is incredible to those who found this at the right time. The dark isn’t so dark when someone else can breath light in to it.
Such genius.
A really good masterpiece!!!!
Realizing you’re playing on the piano in the beginning just finished me. Love you. My opening of 2024 and to the end. Please go on. Please never stop. Please always share with your creation online. Your fan from Ukrainian. And waiting for tickets in London. As soon as you’re in London having a concert I’m there. Love you!!!!
In my opinion this one is the best out of the money series
I'm a little late to the party, I found you through Prof, but I am so glad I did ❤
Wtf i’ve seen that’s Insane🔥
This guy is a breath of fresh air!! True genius!!
still cant get over this
amazing.
Absolutely breathtaking...every single song I heard of him. A master storyteller ❤
Damn Ren
Masterpiece!
Wow!
how many times I've watched this video? yes.
since discovering your music there hasn't been one thing you have done that isn't amazing and the fact you can do some many different types of music 😮😮😮 Please never stop
Ееебать, что я только что посмотрел!? Это великолепно!
Beyond the words - NEXT LEVEL ❤
Art
Ren is the Master!
How do you reconcile the side of the coin identified in Hi Ren with the solution described in money game 3?
Leaving a comment for the algorithm. This is a MASTERPIECE!!
Homie is so talented.
Wow
We need a rap song over the piano rhythm that you played  right before the song started taking off. So dope
❤
Its awesome you have come this far with this tune and not needed big backers like in the music industry.... the next James Bond theme tune buy this guy?
The piano and strings work is incredible. If he wrote the music himself he is the one of the top musicians right now.
Musical genius. Nothing more, nothing less.
Just found you. I've been watching all your videos since I got off work. Keep it up. You've made a fan out of me. I can relate to so much of what you speak of. Thank you.
I listening this part 3 first time now while im turning 45 today. Just that my feeling is that my life is just beginning.
Dammmmmmmnnnnn
Ren's understanding  of western capitalisation is amazing. Thank you for opening my eyes.
🎉❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉😢😢❤
So smooth
Didn't know Thomas Shelby could spit bars
Absolutely love this masterpiece
yikes
Mate!!!
Naw naw 😮 am no up wi the times lad the Jimmy hing!!!! thats a mod reference eh   So I should look it up   Outrageous behaviour lad  Am sure you stole a few heart beat fi me on thìiìiìiiiiiiiiiììís  Kickon  Peace luv n tranquillity   Sub🎉
Beautiful and raw.   A brilliant talent
Top-Notch!!!!
Amazingly each part gets better then the privious, it shows that you aren't just lucky, but that you can actually make great music consistently
I was todays years old when I was introduced to, Hi Ren. I went to his youtube channel and watched his 3 part "Money game" even though I was aiming to check out the rap that brought him fame. I am now sitting here with truth tears in my eyes, questions in my mind, clenched teeth and an urge to both persist and resign. this kid is beyond talented, and I am forever a fan and will revel in the subtext of his music as much as I can.
My only disagreement is that borders were not invented my humans. Even animals create territories. Evolution should have abolished that for us though. Maybe there is time still...
Ren u definitely see north america like I see it.. Rat Race at its best... Smh
If someone asked me to compare your style to other artists…. I wouldn’t have a good answer. You’re so unique. Unlike any other artist out there. You’re like a mix of NF/Eminem/Shakespeare all wrapped in one but with so many more talents. Literally nothing you can’t do. You’re a rapper, singer, not only songwrite but you tell emotional stories with your lyrics, you play every instrument there is it seems… like damn dude. You’re so talented. You had a higher purpose, no doubt. That’s why you’re still here with us ❤ you’re helping so many people. You have such a big heart and the fact that you don’t do what you do for the money but for the people your music helps is very evident.
This feels more like a short film then a music honest
Doesn't this feel like a missed proficy of the Biden family rise and fall. Almost every wage in Jimmy's life had unfolded with the open boarders, sending weapons to the Ukraine and abandoning all our army equipment in the middle east for them to have, the drug problem of hunters fuck up leaving Cobain in the white house or as ren said palace.... hunter tried to shake down china's president..... listen Gain with that in mind. Tell me that doesn't sound like a warning ti the land of the free.
I love this song keep it going
This is our story. Whomever Ren is...I truly hope you are enjoying making this music. Please give to educators
Absolutely in love with this ❤
Holllly shiiiiit😮
This trilogy is absolutely amazing and unfortunately true..  One error I see, though, is that you mention a .45 caliber but you're using 9mm.
Yeppp
Ren to play joker
this is beautiful.
Best young music since Eminem !
♾
Outstanding
When you really want to know the truth it will lead you to Jesus.
Masterpiece!
This man is an artist!
I love how he doesn't tell you the solution.  You either said "let em" or "help em" . I wonder what you came up with.
Masterpiece ❤️🙏✨
Thank you for everything again Ren. ♥
the best video i have ever seen on you tube. but it ascends almost all shows / movies on TV . definitely a contemporary. so good
He is a true artist! I am officially obsessed!
Found you in 2024...your music videos are masterpieces. Brilliantly done.
Unreal I feel like somebody’s finally answered my head as regretful as that may be can also be a thing of tragic beauty
Ren is… a level of in touch brilliance and graphically blunt truth most people I’ve seen seem unwilling to observe, let alone receive and certainly never self-examine.  I applaud your humanity, Ren.
Look at those beautiful hands , ahh .. love this man ! Love his creations xx🌹xx Dana
Wow !!!! How has it taken this long for me to see/hear this Masterpiece, another Ode to money, we've seen so ma y great talents version of "Money".........
с русскими субтитрами просмотров было бы в два раза больше
I just discovered your music and I'm blown away! Love at first listening ❤❤ I don't get impressed easily nowdays but I keep going through your videos and can't get enough. You have a great way of playing with words, lot of wisdom and strong messages in your lyrics 👏👏👏 Hope to see one of your live performances, would travel to UK for that
Geeezus….
Man you do great 😊
Masterpiece!!!!!!!!! Artistic music heartfelt!!
Fuck it hits home so much. Feeling like a disappointment for much of my life. Thanks for sharing.
As a Welsh boy I thank you for putting us on the map
Mistrz
Damn
Absolutely fucking incredibly brilliant. Wow,,,,    you say, you describe the separation between humans and gods..   On that note and only that note, you are wrong!  You are not human, nor demon, and not an angel........   You are a very precious gift,,,,,,    Thankyou!
Ren: "We should love the people who support the money game at our expense."
Get this guy to connect with @stromea! Guaranteed fireworks!
It's talent, skill and creativity. No words for it
wooooooooooooooooow
This isn’t better art , this is a whole new art form !
Thank you @RenMakesMusic for giving us the gift of your art to enjoy
That's so so sad
Arcydzieło nie tylko muzyka a i całe prowadzenie kamery nie mówiąc o grze aktorskiej.
Why am I suddenly naked!???
Loved the song. This resonates deep inside my mind, body, soul, spirit, and entity.  Money Game, Pt. 3 Lyrics  [Piano and yodelling intro]  [Verse 1] Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy 1 years old and his first words were "Mine, mine, gimme!" 2 years old he was walking, 3 years old walking quickly 4 years old he was running 'round the pavements of his city 5 years old and his daddy told him "Listen here, son You gotta learn to be a man, a man, he works for what he wants" 6 years old and he’s reading, writing, top of the bunch And when he's 7, his progression made him student number 1 8 years old and he’s praised for unusual grades 9, his parents pay for private school to nurturе the flame 10, 11, 12, 13, he ascеnds and ascends His daddy tells him "Son, money is the means to all ends" 14, solving complex mathematic equations At 15, IQ 150, still elevating 16, he develops complex software code That detects weaknesses in cyber security protocols 17, and he sells his vision keeping a share Not yet an adult, but he's practically a millionaire 18, and his daddy tells him "Now you're a man This world don't give a damn about you, so take all that you can" 19, he turns a profit stocks and shares invest in product 20, double-down deposits, 21, his income rockets 22, he learns that truth is just an obstacle to wealth If you manipulate the data, then a lie will sell itself 23, a life of luxury, crystal and cocaine 24, he makes the Forbes list, they're applauding his name 25, and his daddy tells him, "Listen here, son While you are sitting in that palace, that don't mean that you won" 26, a business shift, he switches business to arms He's 27, dealing nuclear and shells in Iran 28, inside the Senate money bought him a seat He's 29, a role of the council in the president's suite Now he’s 30, his daddy says "You're losing the race You're just a servant to the king, not even in second place" 31, a big maneuver for his daddy’s approval Moving imports over borders from the exports out of Cuba 32, moving grams, growing kilos to tonnes He's 33, filling warehouses with powder and guns 34, turf war with nobody to stop it Blind eye from the po-po inside of his pocket 35, he gets a call, "I'm sorry son It's your father, had a heart attack, I'm sorry, he’s gone" 36, getting pissed up, abusing his product 37, eyes glazed, disposition demonic 38, with a prostitute, a moment of passion Heating up a silver spoon and then chasing the dragon 39, getting reckless and hungry for power Daddy’s words still driving him to kill and devour He makes a move against the cartel, but the strategy's flawed They retaliate and leave him in a hospital ward A bullet buried in his vertebra and one in his leg The doctor sighs and says "I don’t think you’ll be walking again", fuck  [Verse 2] Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy He was 40, and he cursed the words "Mine, mine, gimme" 41, he wasn’t walking, 42, not walking quickly 43, never running 'round the pavements of his city 44 inside a palace with a mountain of gold But those riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves Weighing heavy on his conscience is the value of gold Lamborghini for a life, trading money for souls Jimmy followed the code inside the land of the free Put your hand inside the cookie jar, take more than you need And his example is exaggerated versions of me And it's a version of him, and it's a version of she And it's a version of you, there’s no escaping the blame The way we live is parasitic, fuck the money and fame! Cut the music!  [Verse 3] This isn’t entertainment, this is real-life The way we live is lunacy, community, it declines We're hyperpolarized, we're always fighting, and we divide Truth is less important than the money that we design? Money's an invention, politics from our invention They all come from peoples' ideas, did I mention? Borders? An invention, law, and order fuel the tension That leads to people killing each other. My solution? Everything is subject to change We could build utopias if individuals were taught to use their brains But if we teach kids in school to always be sheep And put themselves before the herd if there's more money for me Then there’s no future I see, where the humans survive We're parasites inside a Petri dish with cannibal minds Mold will grow upon a surface, then consumes till it dies And our fate could be the same without this story for the wise  [Outro] 45, Jimmy comes home out of the rain Soaking wet upon a wheelchair, drinking again He is everything he wants, he has fortune and fame He’s a fortunate fool with an unfortunate fate With a 45 caliber aimed at his brain 45 - a fitting number, 'cause his age is the same Hears the words of his father; "It's such a damn shame" Then he presses on the trigger of a money game
You could make a littoral musical out of just this song lol
Gives me Hamilton vibes. I am sure it's on purpose. Not a bad thing.
REN could you make a musical movie and or broadway show. With the music and videos you produce, the acting and art and emotion in your videos. It would be a sell out show. Get other musicians in it. NF would be a good fit for a character….. I just think it would be the best thing ever. Lin Manuel Miranda could help you execute it. Or even Tim Burton
Genius
Incredible job. Congratulations to everyone involved.
8 million views in a world of more than 8 billion people?  That's a problem!   This record should be shared with every single person you know and love! Regardless of their age, gender, sexual preference, political views etc!
REN you’re an Absolute monster on lyrics
dude....i had never heard of you before about a month ago. idk how you came up on my youtube but im certainly glad you did. your music is a breath of fresh air and i have thoroughly enjoyed listening to everything of yours on repeat. just freaking brilliant. my sister died this past month and i took in her 4 children along with my own 2 already....flew them in from newyork and with them came a bad bout of pneumonia for me. ive been struggling being out of work and having so many kids i wasnt ready for but your music has been getting me through man. cheers.
I don’t know how many times I have to say this, but this is a visual and lyrical masterpiece. Nothing comes close to Ren right now.
Leaving another comment to share this❤
i love your music so much
brilliant
This isn’t just music. THIS IS ART. A MASTERPIECE 🤯🔥
Water-bottle water-bottle water-bottle you mention… Im Hank Marvin gettin booted at the football convention. 39 im knicker knackered to the geezers suspicion, actin mint but really gutted by my mates proposition!!

usually i listen to music on spotify but this masterpiece is worth coming on youtube just to watch and listen to it here
i  love ya
Masterpiece
How old was the father? My math or comprehension skills are not adding up. Was the father ten when Jimmy was born?
Just now discovered this man. You have a new fan, Ren! You sing the truth with no filters, and this needs to be seen worldwide! Salutations From a French man in Quebec, Canada!❤
Ren ,Please.pay  my bills.i         need earn my life
With the fucking masterpiece like this, it feels like an insult to call Ren a rapper.
🤔 a reminder that boys have daddy issues too ×× 🎬 Lord of war springs to mind but no daddy issues there & i want you too keep fucking up the status quo THE HUMAN SPECIES NEED A NEW WORLD ORDER or a plauge I'd gladly be patient zero for a 90% cull
Wtf why am I just discovering this now!!! Better late than never though I guess 🔥
GRATEFUL 🙏 WONDER WHAT IQ IS ??
MAESTRO × A LYRICAL GENIUS YOU ARE × FANTASTIC VIDEO × SO GREATFUL
I was captivated from start to finish 👏🏼
OMG.WHO ARE YOU!! Im from the UK and just randomly Stumbled onto one of your tracks, watched a few more, and another few, and now all. Your like a mix of Eminem, The streets and plan b. Your rapping is insane and your topic is so on point it makes my hair stand on end. You sir are a true legend. I feel like you are the voice to our feelings. A messiah of modern rap music.(and you can sing❤) Every one of your tracks hits deep, from the heart, with an uncocky realism that we can can resonate with. You deserve everything that you are about to achieve, And you are a welcome dose of reality that we all need to hear in times like this. YOU'RE AN INSPIRATION TO ALL US ALL!! (And your video editor is amazing too)❤❤❤
Quelle claque je me prends ce soir, je vous découvre il y a qques minutes sur un titre de Bob Marley, je craque. Je gratte et tombe sur cette dinguerie !  Waouh terrible 🤟  Kisses from 🇧🇪
Netflix has nothing on Ren. He makes and tells stories better than most movies do
at 26 my step father shot me drunk fighting my mother and he ended up leaving me paralyzed from waist down it took few years to to where i wasnt chemically depended to pain meds or psyc by 32 i was completely off everything but medical marijuanna. 34 now with bong sitting right here chillin lol
Nepobaby anthem.
At last! The storm finally came!    What a masterpiece, this is just perfection, every single theme mentioned and every word told. Can't believe I somehow didn't now about this for a year despite the first 2 parst being some of my favourite songs but still, better later than never.
Your videos that are 9minutes long seem almost too short! Very captivating -musically/instruments& beats, lyrically/message & craft/ vocally/tone,cadence, Visually/background, live one shot takes, theme, and just emotionally packs a punch that my ear drum loves to reverberate to. Kudos Ren you are about to level up for sure!!!!!
🙂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤👍✅............... 😎
once in a generation talent. There's just no one like Ron
Beyond brilliant 🎉
True story! 😎 Brilliant story telling and a swipe at greed!
I'm impressed. Masterpiece and quality of music and video way better than most of massmedia production.
his art speaks truth!
Holy shit, the truth is rock hard.
love all your work bro, your head is in the right place keep doing what your doing and i send good vibes your way to help in the dark times. peace love and respect to all
Stay in the light.
Far Beyond Genius! 🙏
🔥 fire
This is legend. Instant fan when I heard Ren, lyrical and music genius. Im 46 and completly impressed! Raw beauty a very rare gem.
NAKED NAKERED SNAKED AND NEVER BE AFRAID AS THIS IS AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN A GIFT YOU HAD ES TES BAN OST EDSE REMEMBER SOME TINGS TINS MEN SAS QUQUQU EENSA
But with a glorious matter👌
He is just stating the obvious
2024 enyone
I respect u and  admire you..kept doing u, your doing great
3:32-3:45 The Truth is Just an Obstacle to wealth, if you manipulate the Data the lie will sell itself….  Oh that line, How Great that one is!!
Excellent , no more to say x
should have said "5 pounds of pressure ended his money game"
Somebody give the person that told Tom Shelby start music a prize cus this a BANGER
🖤
😮wow,,
Thank you for every bit of music you do you are a light in the darkness my friend absolutely amazing talent never give up you inspire a new generation
Yeah....  This must've been quite cathartic to work out.  Well played  It was a pleasure to share our hatred of the Money Game
A very talented man. such a contrast from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSeCuR51rek&t
awsome song such a banger'
It’s done very well let’s go
such a simple music video with such a strong message
Oh dear god. This is not just music, this is pure art.  I would love to see you collabing with Oliver Sykes. You will have so much  fun working together on something.
This man's art is amazing
Holy fuck!!! Amazing, your lyrics are great, so powerful, it speaks truth we all feel beaten by the system that is designed to keep us in our place will the 1% ers keep putting there hand in our money pot.
Shakespeare :) yes, this is how bullies are made. Profound bro.
What a fucking genie!!!! Unglaublich gut.
This guy is amazing with his lyrics there so deep, all I can say is thankyou bro n get well soon! The world needs more people like you ! When r u n chinchilla gna drop another banger .
i honestly dont have words except wow and brilliant and thank you
This song made me cry because too many people are committing suicide and I blame the medical community for giving us toxins to consume instead of real remedies. God help us all.
WOW!!! keep on pounding those ivories man you are freaking awesome!
This is an absolute masterpiece. Ren has given me hope that artists; real artists, and artistic integrity are not dead. In an age of repetitive, braindead and soulless songs (lookin at you, Gen Alpha...) this is a welcome breathe of fresh air. We need more artists like Ren and less artists like Sematary (worst "artist" i could think of off the dome).
Fukkin brilliant man. Seriously.
I love his stories, share his music here in Austria... We love this kind of music we can feel...   He es a releave for hiden soules
Atsakymas❤💥🙀🙏
I like your art!
Can we talk more about what a masterpiece the piano in this song is?! The piano could almost tell the story without the lyrics. It's so good.
Another   badass music  video
The fact that this video has so many views and so few likes shows how many people don't understand how important it is to like and comment to promote what you like and share really good musicians with more people. It's really sad, I always try to share what I really like.
Love the brilliance of this so much ❤
Is this about any one particular, or is it just a made up character?
Brilliant
Wow Ren ,  you are truly a master of your craft.  I imagine you get constantly bombarded with Capitalist trying to exploit your talent for their gain.   Your music is truly more than just melodies and rhythm.  You’re a genius, messenger, and beacon for people to wake the f&$@ up.  I have never heard better music.  We are rooting for you across the pond.  I hope you feel better soon.  Thanks for being real and sharing your talent.
Modern day Thomas Shelby
a pretentious video, full of cheap truisms, gratuitously complicated, self-referential and prosaic, devoid of any real meaning or purpose, specific to an idiocratic era, it doesn't say anything to me and seems like the most wasted minutes of my life... extraordinarily amused by the number of likes received
What channel is this?
Amazing.
I like to think I live a frugal lifestyle and I still have way more than I need. Gonna actively work towards being better about it. Help people in your local community.
This is going in my book . Thank you for sharing. i see you,  hear you,  and relate to these dimensions of reality... 😢❤
Pz no 4
I love ren❤ he is a heat and soul
3:42 The first time I see his face. CLEARLY
kinda crazy that I came across this track & ren’s music at age of 45…
Just discovered Ren and I am speechless..... Can't wait to see everything he made
Fuck bro.  Non stop good hits from you.  I recently discovered you about two weeks ago..... LOVE IT!  One of the good things you do is make good long songs, I'm so sick of these 1:30 to 2:30 song lengths.  Completely absurd.  Your style is awesome, seems like you are continually evolving making better and better songs for all your viewers.  The views really don't match your talent brother, you should have in the tens of millions!  You have a delightful passion making the songs you make and I can't wait to hear more!  Keep on keepin on brother!
such a powerfull message!  Are we going to talk about the fact that you look like Thommas shelby in general but even more like that lol. Anyways, such an amazing song, keep it up!
Its incredible how one artist, a few of his songs can turn despair into connection.
PHENOMENAL!
Here to say Prof and Ren are amazing. Kindred silly souls.
This is a true musician and storyteller
Masterpiece
Artist!
Ren.... Boss xxx
When it starts 2:13
👌
Masterpiece!!!
Poet laureate one day
This man is going to change the course of music. Im 71 live in New Zealand. Fro romford 50 urs ago. So relatable
This is just insanely well written... just waw
I just love Ren.
Jimmy? OMG MR.Breast
Wow 😮 xx
Not a rapper, a artist, wow!!
Intense, unique, original, remarkable with a deep reality check highlighted to everyone. My only words once I watched every second intensely..........WOW. I'm from Brighton and have seen Ren perform on the streets buskin. You've been around for a good while, you, your music and the meanings in between the lines are incredible and touch home deeply! You are most definitely going to take not only the UK but the world by storm, It's happening now. Big fan, much respect and keep up the incredible work!
Wooooow!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
You are a damn talent! Greetz from the Hard Side!
Greatest
He is right, but he he is also wrong. He is a child, and until you've lived a full life, you can't see the full picture. I am 51. I've been his age. I know what he is seeing, but there is so much more to see. Without borders, we have no country, no matter what country we are speaking of. We can't prosper in a New Wolrld Order. Just because some people take advantage of the system doesn't mean the system is wrong. One day, I assume, Ren will figure it out. He is deep and reflects. Very impressive for a young man. But it takes time and real world experience to see what is true and good. Life is a journey. Live it without judgment. Just observe.
❤😊❤
Simply amazing
Your an absolutely genus
We the people Ⲱ໑ჩLძ Ⲱໃძⲉ ⲛⲉⲉძ ⲁ ჩⲉV໑Lນⲧໃ໑໗!
Amazing Artist.  Top album.
fucking genius !!
Impressive, very well done!
This guy must be a damn genius! Keeps impressing me!
Wow il sait vraiment raconter une histoire avec son art
Wow. Absolutely amazing. Well done!
EPIC. . every single time
Wow I never comment on things but this man REN just spoke straight facts and the amount of chills it sends down your Spine is insane. The way we see the world is it spins around money and it’s just insane that we put such high value on a piece of paper the was invented. It’s truly saddening how we are breaking the world and we don’t even realize how bad it’s actually getting
Discovered you this year in Germany. Been running on a loop 24/7 when doing things 🔥  you have a rare talent and it shines bright 🙏
Speaking for the diversity of your audience, I’m a 54 year old woman in Ohio, you are doing beautiful and important work!❤️
❤❤❤❤ Ren I am sending healing energy from one sixk-o to another ❤❤❤ Please Re Re Re launch this banger 🔥
This Is the best one yet 👀
Boy, he just puts the  Elitist World Dead Spot Center of what they truly are. Nothing, Hallow, Misery with Money. Intake will eventually implode. Just 10 simple societal rules as the Ancients knew, apply them and you will grow. It could save a community along with you. If you want freedom you actually have to create it for everybody around you before you receive it yourself. Deny it and you will fail. With the height always comes to fall.
After I first heard this I didn’t think I'd listen to it again because I found Jimmy’s entire story so horrific. However several of my favourite vocal teachers/opera singers reacted to the video and I became enthralled with all the details of the production of the video and the music.  I now have all the Money Games in order on a couple of favourite playlists.  I even have Su!cide on a playlist and hear it regularly, after choking crying for 20 minutes after I first saw/heard it.
Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy One years old and his first words were, "Mine, mine, gimmie" Two years old he was walking, three years old walking quickly Four years old he was running round the pavements of his city Five years old and his daddy told him, "Listen here, son You gotta learn to be a man; a man he works for what he wants"  Six years old and he's reading, writing, top of the bunch And when he's seven, his progression made him student number one Eight years old and he's praised for unusual grades Nine, his parents pay for private school to nurture the flame Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, he ascends and ascends His daddy tells him, "Son, money is the means to all ends"  Fourteen, solving complex mathematic equations Fifteen, IQ a hundred and fifty, still elevating Sixteen, he develops complex software code That detects weaknesses in cyber security protocols Seventeen, and he sells his vision, keeping a share Not yet an adult, but he's practically a millionaire Eighteen, and his daddy tells him, "Now you're a man This world don't give a damn about you, so take all that you can"  Nineteen, he turns a profit, stocks and shares invest in product Twenty, double-down deposits, 21, his income rockets 22, he learns that truth is just an obstacle to wealth If you manipulate the data, then the lie will sell itself  23, a life of luxury, crystal and cocaine 24, he makes the Forbes list, they're applauding his name 25, and his daddy tells him, "Listen here, son While you're sitting in that palace, that don't mean that you won" 26, a business shift, he switches business to arms He's 27, dealing nuclear and shells in Iran 28, inside the senate, money bought him a seat He's 29, a role of council in the president's suite  And now he's 30, his daddy says "You're losing the race You're just a servant to the king, not even in second place" 31, a big maneuver for his daddy's approval Moving imports over borders from the exports out of Cuba 32, moving grams, growing kilos to tons He's 33, filling warehouses with powder and guns 34, turf war with nobody to stop it Blind eye from the po-po inside of his pocket 35, he gets a call: "I'm sorry, son It's your father, had a heart attack, I'm sorry, he's gone"  36, getting pissed up, abusing his product 37, eyes glazed, disposition demonic 38, with a prostitute, a moment of passion Heating up a silver spoon and then chasing the dragon 39, getting reckless and hungry for power Daddy's words still driving him to kill and devour He makes a move against the cartel, but the strategy's flawed They retaliate and leave him in a hospital ward A bullet buried in his vertebra and one in his leg The doctor sighs and says, "I don't think you'll be walking again" (Fuck)  Let me tell you a story about a boy named jimmy He was 40, and he cursed the words: "Mine, mine, give me" 41, he wasn't walking, 42 not walking quickly 43, never running round the pavement of his city 44, inside a palace with a mountain of gold But those riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves Weighing heavy on his conscience is the value of gold Lamborghini for a life, trading money for souls  Jimmy followed the code inside the land of the free Put your hand inside the cookie jar, take more than you need And his example is exaggerated versions of me And it's a version of him And it's a version of she And it's a version you There's no escaping the blame The way we live is parasitic, fuck the money and fame Cut the music  This isn't entertainment, this is real life The way we live is lunacy, community it declines We're hyper-polarized, we're always fighting, then we divide Truth is less important than the money that we designed?

You deserve the best man.  Greetz from Poland!  Stay safe and healthy!
you renare aremarkable man
Does anyone know what's playing at 0:14 - 0:24 I think I heard it in some classical song, but I can't remember which one.
This isn't entertainment... this is real life.  When I listened that first, (still, sorrying myself for interrupting) I thought wow what should I say? This isn't entertainment... this is real life. Tanks Ren for the words I was missin'
Another great tune n vid.....thank you Knox
Best.
soo coollll
he's not singing he's telling a tale with melody
old soul.  just look at his hands
Dear SIR Ren, thank you for deep emotions that you inflicted on me. Your lyrics and theyr's  visual representations goes trought my skin right to bones. It's painfull as it should be. But that pain wakes up many...
Here's a story... about 3 years ago, I lost my right leg... about a year after that, my boyfriend of 13 years died. 3 weeks later, I lost my other leg. Everything coming at me so fast, I left everything ive ever owned and went into a nursing home wearing my dead boyfriends favorite shirt and my purse.   I'm getting to the hopeful part. So, I was in there for 2½ years... TODAY... November 12, I got out and am in my new apartment. Im feeling hopeful and less suicidal.    I'm in constant physical pain, just had kidney stones and broke my hand.. but I'm still here  People tell me all the time how strong I am, they they couldn't go through what I did.... and I tell them BULLSHIT!, strength has nothing to do with it... you just have to adapt...  with me I had to find new ways to do things.. it's not strength, it's because you have no choice.  Okay, I'm getting there... you're going through a lot right now, and sometimes you get so overwhelmed you don't know where to start... One thing at a time. I know it sounds silly, but you will get through this and find your happiness and hope. I have new legs now, one is bionic.. very not religious.. but sometimes I feel things are getting better because I deserve it. So do you. You deserve to beat this. I understand the pain.. it can be all consuming,  or you can practice Mindfulness for chronic pain.  It sounds ridiculous,  but there are techniques where after a while, you're still in pain, but you feel it as a part of you, it becomes normal. I'm not describing it right.  Fuck, I'm wired. Sorry  Also geniuses and neurodivergents tend to find eachothet  I think it would be extremely cathartic for you to do a song about your pain... from your viewpoint and from others  You will see you are not alone. Meaning a high intellect needs simulati0n. Write a beautiful song about what it's like to be sick,
Superb
You're truly amazing. YouTube or TikTok videos, I stop and watch. Chill multiple times. Just turned 50 this month. The way you express yourself. The other person I think of who I felt so much passion and pull me into the song was Mac Miller. He was way younger as well, but the words he used throughout his songs I could feel his pain & happiness, as well as mine. Thank you!
absolutely amazing Ren and Sam.
Is there anything Ren can't do? He plays piano and guitar like a god, raps and sings unnaturally well, I believe he can do anything he outs his mind too. Ren is an amazing artist. I hope you keep producing music. Every song you write is absolutely amazing. Keep up the good work.
Wow!! Ren for prime minister! Some of the smartest shit I heard in a long time! Would of listened to another 90 minutes 💪🏻 Well done lad, let it out 👊🏻
Could you put this into an oculus virtual experience .
I see
I love the piano up to 18 years old. I keep repeating it. The whole song is amazing but the first section is exceptional musically
Bravo Monsieur.
.. i fell in love with you... talent from God ...
❤❤❤
This is Art!!!
Did your write this back beat yourself if so your should stick to dong this mate you kill it big time don’t let anyone else ruin your dreams my man your a fuckin diamond and got me through so many rough times in the last 5years I met you once but you wouldn’t remember me but I wanted to say thankyou coz life is difficult and you’ve made mine easier I can switch off to you and ground myself I know I’m not the only person going through shit when I listen to you thankyou for everything you do I’m a single man of 45 who’s daughters have both been raped by the same man and your words and music has seriously stopped me being a murderer thankyou REN much love
Wow! Mind blown! I only discovered this by chance, after reading a comment about the election. What a brilliant mind.
This literally made me cry. I'm 39...I feel this deeply. This guy is extremely wise and talented, especially for his age. Well done.
this is a masterpiece -- genius Ren
The way this song just gives me chills. I can not wait for the day Ren blows up and every person hears these songs of truth!
I am glad I have just witnessed the Mozart of this era . Sweet Jesus...deep❤ 😮
lets be honest ren sings so much better when hes not using the instruments himself. 10/10 song
Jesus fucking christ. Faith restored in musical artistry prevailing.
I have never been moved by someone's lyrics/life/music/ideology as much as I have from the money game series. I feel it. I live it. I want out. I want what life can be - not what it is. Not the systems that govern us created by those who it favoured. We're all humans and we should start acting like it. This life isn't a game, it's a gift
I've watched these videos nearly every night on the back of a good beer. You sir are amazing. Legend
Hhh
Incredible work Man!
Masterpiece song and masterpiece clip…Chapeau bas 👍
This guy is the real deal. I love a geniune artist that is authentic in what they are and what they want to share. It's talent comes from the soul.
The story of evil mr beast
I feel like when I watch this guy it's like watching horrible histories back a day
Love it ❤
Too true, too true
What is your solution? How can I help?
You're a very talented person. I hope you are heard. Big love
that’s pure art
The cinematography is amazing! 2 cuts for over 9 minutes is insane!
THIS is art! You are a visionary genius, my friend, I love everything you do! I just hope people truly listen to this..

Powerfull
❤🙌
I've never bothered to watch a music video, but this was something else.... this is nothing short of art, pure expression in a cleverly devised manner.... Just, phenomenal.
wow.
This is fucking brilliant
I just can't believe how incredible the ART of this is. Lyrics, flow, instruments, set, story. Everything is just perfect. Thanks again Ren for creating another masterpiece!
This guy and his videoogaphry is amazing. Not to mention his voice is immaculate! I wish I had musical talent.
I like money
Absolutely incredible 💨💨💨💨
My solution...."Everything is subjedt to change.  Love u Ren, ✝️💫🙏
Thus guy...is FUCKIN MADNESS BRUV 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Should be a movie even though life already is! In all truth lil sad how creativity is the only thing being murdered in this video a lonely child full of hope and future killed by adult ambition.
This is masterpiece listened to this numerous times over the last week it's incredible!! REN is a special talent !!
I feel sinful for not knowing this existed for a year, part 2 was my biggest loop during quarantine so not knowing of this for a year makes me feel like I should be executed for that.
I hope 9ne day I can shake your hand sir. You are absolutely amazing

Hi ren
Every time, that never loses its impact.
This is master piece
Seriously what some powerful words. Needs to be recognised more for his talent.
This is truly a piece of Art, which is such a rare thing these days to see, I lose hope in humanity sometimes, but then comes along artists such as Ren and  Tom MacDonald and it gets restored 😁😁👍
I finally figured it out: When you are done abusing the monetary system, you will become its victim. Just like you victimized others the system have no respect for you.
leaves me breathless everytime i watch it
This is what you get when you work hard whith blood sweat and tears this is a peice of art
Bad boy Jimmy give me give me He was drove insane 😂❤😊 what a shame ain’t a dam thing changed 😊
Your music saved my life one night, thank you for your music it’s so real
I love this so very much, 13-year-old ethical hacker here saying keep up the good work stay independent. Your music is what inspires me to keep making my own keep going.❤
IDK if he's talking about Elon musk or Donald Trump or just corrupt politician in general
An American story
For those that dont know, Ren shoots all his videos in 1 take. Another tidbit if you werent impressed already. Absolute genius.
Epic ❤🎉
Amazing Ren you put it out there. Most of us are too terrified to try. Thanks for truth.
WTF!!!!!!! This is a F#@KING MASTERPIECE OF A VIDEO!!!!! Everything is perfect... BRAVO 🎉🎉💪💪👊💪👊💪
8:36  45 <3 Danm...
I have a new favorite artist, his name is Ren. You are chaos and the calm, you are beautiful
This is deep!!!
Absolutely raw. The best thing I’ve seen and heard in a very long time. Truly awesome.
Jimmy beast
First time hearing this song. Randomly just played. So glad I didn't skip it. This jamz.
Bloody amazing...truth speak.!!!!
You impressed me again, just no words Ren thx for being more awareness in to the world, you play a big part in the new understanding, your art bring people back to there heart “feeling” instead of the head, every emotion is so well expressed and it touches your soul ❤🙏🏻
How am i yet to see the videos to go with mt 3 fave songs. I feel disappointed in myself 😂
Antie donna love you your lolo
Mom tell sis wheel chair paul walker
Together family kids
Park party
Love you mother tori cane
Sun flower nation shark tank
I relate to this song. And im 43! F**king truth, hearts!
This is a masterpiece
I just discovered this amazing artist because of my friend, Damn Ren is Lit with his words!
Mind blowing
...but no one can escape this money game.
It's the people who can't share utopias
Dude sweats hit park lmao
💖💖
A true MASTER of the spoken word ❤
Just stumbled upon this on snap. Thank you ❤
Thats love
Pick me up greattas
true masterpiece of the whole team
They should make a new genre of music called REN. Every song is a journey! Musically,  lyrically,  visually. Definitely a precher in your past life. Im living the journey you are taking my on though!
I am in awwwwe of you both! On a different level than most. Absolutely amazing!
Great artist fuck mainstream
Everything is subject to change, we could build utopias if individuals were taught to use their brains, and keep their fingers off the fucking triggers, treat all guns as if they are loaded, know their targets and what lays beyond them, and not point them at anything they aren't willing to destroy! Otherwise I love the video.
This is Snowden's dark timeline
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
They should hire Ren to play the Joker :D
Damn this is good.
Love you Ren &Co.
❤
this song hits diffrent. love it
Man, I don't know why I waited this long to see this, maybe the jokes all around the second one turned me off, maybe I just thought pt 2 would be your magnum opus, maybe I just lost interest.  Either way, this was awesome.  Maybe we don't agree much on economics from what I can tell in your music, but I will agree with you on this, it is important.
Wow merciii de réveiller les humains ❤
This is pure poetry
I kinda forgot those were blanks at the end I almost screamed noooo
I hope you don't buy out and be hypocritical x
so beautiful man. so beautiful
now THIS is art
and people say this guy isnt the best ?????? come on
Leave it on brav
❤brav
This song has so many layers and hits a place in the heart not many songs can match today.I only recently discovered ren,wish I’d have learned sooner
Thanks for sharing.
Leaving a comment for the algorithm this is a masterpiece ✨️ 👏
Thank You
Oh goodness gracious it's AWESOME!!❤❤❤
attention to detail is amazing, money game part one, one person in seat with bag over his head, part three ren starts with bag over head and everyone else has bag over head, he says we are all to blame, my interpretation is this is why all have bag over head, also dont know if ren done this on purpose, but when he cues the violins and chello at 40 years old he holds up 4 fingers one at a time, then does a fist, like 40 years old, knowing ren it was on purpose, or im just reading to much into it 🤣
Thank you, Ren! Your music sets my body on fire. and it’s  music for my Soul. Your words send chills down my spine that I hope many don’t know. You words cuts deep, yet is music to ears. I appreciate your talent and what is you have to share. Thank you again, REN for baring your would and showing us how to feel
I'm an old school rock/punkt/metal-fan and usually don't look "on the other side", but this is true art. Love every piece of it. Thank you, algorythm :)  and thank you, ren. Keep up with it! ❤
I am 71 years old and completely agree with you.  I grew with the Beatles and Motown, etc. and always felt blessed to be alive at such a time.. And now, as I enter my twilight years, we have Ren, who is an incredible talent. He may indeed be a modern Shakespeare.
When I listened to this I felt the same way when I read the Anthem from Ayn Rand, but different direction, showing the extreme end of an ideology which wakes you up and expands your view.  These situations are all possible outcomes and every outcome starts as a possibility.
IMPRESIONNANT
I'm not sure if you'll read this Ren, but I was driving home with listening to Spotify with my daughter in the car and this song came on and she was very invested in the lyrics of this, when it ended she said how deep the song was, so I'm listening to more of your songs with her and she loves your music. Thank you for such thought provoking lyrics!
The world dont give a damn about you so take all that you can 🔥 🔥🔥🖕
Looking Dapper!
UAU
I have not told this for very long time. This is real talent.  And artists as Ren is less popular than some kardashians, unreal.
Ahh so you’re British hopsin
just damn...
Just my opinion but I feel Ren and Marshal Mathers needs to do a album
Can i not exist?
Wow! 👏
Holly (all the mad words) but this is art my friend!
45 oooooh im eternal
I ❤ this. Why isn’t he main stream? This is so good and so real!!
truth is an invention
True.
Damn... I have no words... let's vote for Ren as the president
Powerful masterpiece
They should make movies off of your songs frfr also your acting is kinda fire in song like "Hi Ren" and "Kujo beatdown"
Would it be great to heal the world with only the song?!
❤👁️👄👁️nice
What a player!!
YOUR SO GOOD IN ACTING ALSO NICE MUSIC VIDEO❤❤❤❤❤
YOUR A GOOD STORY TELLER RAPPER GENUIS..❤❤❤❤❤
Just art 🖤🖤🖤
Omg this is a piece of art where has this been all my life?!
Wow.
Eh.
I cant help, but he looks like Tommy Shelby :,)
Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your oeuvres. We try to raise our kids properly, but this material world is mental, and it's hard not only for the kids but for us adults, too, to fight our demons and eagerness for extra comfort or even a lavish lifestyle. What makes it even harder to show the same success level as our community is that we live in a rather comfortable neighbourhood in a third-world country. I'm glad my kids at least love to read and learn piano and chess, but one day, I'll show them your videos to better understand how humankind becomes broke and how creative people can be.
This is so amazing. Hope to have the opportunity to meet you one day bro, real men aren’t afraid to show their emotion and you have helped me show mine. I owe you a pint and hug, one human to another.

I only discovered your music a few months ago, I must say I love everything about you. I’ve been following you on Facebook and YouTube, your music hits in a completely different way. Like no one has ever done before!! I love every song you’ve made, every lyric means something to you, speaks to the listener. Tells us your story but also tells us about the world we live in that we turn a blind eye to 😢
Epic and disturbing! ❤ Ren you are the 1st Artist for decades that resonates
Ren your music touch me like nothing else, I love the trilogy music you produce, The rest is amazing don't get me wrong, But I love your story telling. Your music is on another level than anything I've heard! Keep it going I am there 100% supporting from Canada!
Holy f@@k. Stunning! This is f——art!
hi i love your music genesis espesily sry for bad spelling
I can’t believe how talented this guy is ❤
Brilliant artist ❤❤❤
How can every single song you make possibly be so perfect? ❤❤
Du siehts da aus wie einer von den "Peaky Blinders"😂 Siehst gut aus

Mad love from an American in the UK
Hi ren! 😂 wanted to comment that for a while now 😅 just not on that song anyway big fan. Super proud of you

Sublime
He is art in his purist form <3
I can't believe what i just seen
I love the comedy of "my solution?" **Cocks gun**
Completely blown away by this artist! Why tbe heck am I JUST hearing Ren?!❤
Ren is original that tells the truth
I love his sound ❤
Love your stuff, but trigger warning should be included. Be careful if you care!
Modern bard.
He could've split this into three parts and made some more money from releasing more singles, making no more fans, he could've taken advantage of this popular trilogy and turned it into a long series of songs.
The fact that this all looks like it done with one take is fucking amazing.

Prophetic 🥰
Keep it up Ren! And best wishes to your health
FXCKKIN MASTERPIECE.
With the label "Art", YouTube will let you go pretty far.
A real life modern day Tommy Shelby ❤
This has automatically become one of my favourite songs... same with "Hi Ren"
😆👌
So whens the musical? Because this alone would be an amazing story for one
Hey you should make a video with all the parts together
Ren for world leader
Eurovision is rigged.
Absolute Masterpiece.
This is just incredible!!!!
I am alive after this..... and this only
**cough** j.t. **cough**
Fuck,- no narrative

8:42 somebody told me once before you commit suicide first kill everybody else make sure they're not the problem 8:44
Comment for the algorithm. Have a nice day.
Mr beast: the story
Egg
Brilliant doesn't even feel adequate. How does he have such a grasp on politics, socioeconomics, and ethics? so much so that he can package it up in such a powerful, palatable, package. He's like the Dr Seuss that we need right now.
Daddy gave him the rules to win. He only listened when it came with an ass beat. He should have listened more.
It's hard to blow the mind with greatness more than once. Ren guy,  please just play you.  I listen to truth i only hear catering to programming
Reminds me of a modern day John Keats
einfach geil
poignant.
ren <3
I want a song with u and dax in it
Wow
Wow. Just wow. Music throughout history had bewop, soul, funk, punk, rock, electronic and everything else, but this is simply outstanding musical commentary at its best. Nothing like it. Outstanding
You Fallen Angels done with being animals yet?
Why I'm I just seeing this a yr after it was released ? This young man is dripping talent.
His lyrics really draw you in and make you feel something ! I love his songs
At a loss of words at the moment Beautiful this was beautiful.
This guy is not just a story teller but a freaking teacher. Clearly wise beyond his years
Thank you! For surviving your Dark and keeping your bright gorgeous light!
❤ OMG MY DAUGHTER JUST HOOKED ME UP TO YOU AND I AM BLOWN AWAY.  IT'S LIKE YOU GET INSIDE MY MIND. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING YOU AND SHARING YOUR ❤️ AND THOUGHTS WITH US. 😊
Humans are committing suicide without even realizing it. But those who do realize protest but they end up getting killed either way. Society sucks man.
This video is from another planet!!😮 AMAZINGLY AMAZING!
Absolutely remarkable! You truly outdid yourself!
Am sorry my love am such a fk up  love how do you know it's love  because it hurts me to see you sad
I'd watch every film he'll be in! ❤ Ren, you are a masterpiece yourself! Xx
You r brilliant Mate
Wow just found that MASTERPIECE just know. You did amazing, greetz from an austrian living in the us at the moment. I have to go through your music man, you are amazing!
This bloke doesn't just chat he says real, last was Devlin, these guys have lived s**t and relate long live REN
Bro, just discovered you and as a fellow English political critic and mental health sufferer, you are a genius
Just found Ren this morning. I feel like Ren should create a musical. The story telling in the lyrics is so powerful but the melodies catchy.
Discovered Ren today, Today is a nice day
Too real
Truth seekers like he, I and you know what is true. We feel it as do you.   I see know that all that I perceived as “done to me” just HAD to be.  The truth has always been here in plain sight. One of the reasons I can walk , wearing sunglasses at night.   We sing songs, tell story, endure and fight.  Ahhh heck with it.  I will walk wearing sunglasses at night. Not even looking side to side. Often I just close my eyes.   We have said it in so many times in so many ways. Proved it everyday.  Still they say… when will we be saved.  We scream it from the rooftops, say it to the wall. Still they call.   What we say.  Sit down , shut up, put your hands in your lap , let go and breathe.  Go with in that is where you will find what you need.  Everything we need is in a seed. Over and over we ask  open your eyes see through the lies . For us the noise is deafening.  So we yell.  Then we sit down  shut up with our hands in our laps and try to breath.  I will hold mine beyond it becoming a need. Little tiny deaths every day until dawn. Then again we run, reach and wonder. We are not lost.  We are here.  They are looking but they do not see.  They ask but can’t hear and if by chance they do, they do not believe.  We are here. We never did hide.  That’s why I can cross the street wearing sun glasses at night . I don’t bother to look side to side.   Heck often I just close my eyes.    We never gave up on hope … for the human race.  We watch , we wait, we sing, we dance , we ride , and fly, we tell story.  I am he, as you are he as you are me.  And WE are all together.   No stopping IT now. IT is here IT has been all along.  Come together, sit down shut up put your hands your your lap , listen , listen to self, listen to story ,listen to song.  Hundreds of thousand of so called  “crazy” might not be wrong.   Let go of the duality. Don’t listen to echos.

Ren is simply an expression of the minds inner turmoil, lyrically expressing what most feel deep down inside. Every day I struggle with mental anguish, but keep my demons in check as to appease those who love and care for me. Thanks Ren for all you do for people like us, providing a voice, through art and expression.
why he giving me Peaky Blinders vibes
I am moved. wow
🎉 Happy birthday 🎉
Love this
Oh man, so smart and so stupid about how things work......lame
Wow, I just found this after finding clips in shorts and reels. I teach English in an American University in China.  I do a poetry class and I am going to show my students this as an example of what poetry is. They have been deadened to poetry by being force fed the Chinese classical poets (Su Shi,  Li Bai, et al) all through High School, I want to reawaken their love of poetry and this will be at the top of the class to highlight how powerful modern poetry can be. Also brilliant storytelling. (If anyone has a link to this with embedded subs please point me at it)
Love every bit of it! 🤩❤️‍🔥

Story of Mark zuckerberg ?? :P :P
Happy one year anniversary ❤❤ This was the 1st premiere of anything I ever watched on YouTube! You guys made it incredibly rememberable and I love this one so much! It's deserved all the awards It's received!😊
Insanity in you is the sanity in mine
This is a true masterpiece. It’s a true shame that the only thing people will listen to is repetitive music like fe!n truly ashamed
Ren, where have you been all my life?... You understand me and my inner thoughts like no one else.
Comment for the algorithm, this is incredible.
Amaing Ren. I love your art. There is only one Ren. God Bless you young man.
Ren, you are a beautiful human being and a gift to this world!
I don’t think you know how good you are But you really am greetings from the Netherlands ❤
What an amazing storyteller!  WOW.  This is something special.
"Cut the music! This isnt entertainment, this is real life. The way we live is lunacy, community it declines."  My favorite bars. Truth 💯
Beautiful
👏 👏👏 👏👏👏👏👏👏 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I genuinely think that Ren is the most important artist in the world today. I’ve never felt the obligation, desire and the *need* to share an artists work as broadly as I can, because the message resonates so much and demands to be heard.
Long live REN
The song and video are both incredible masterpieces ! Ren and Sam, THANK YOU.
That last lyric was crazy.
Hi Ren Let me introduce myself ,iam a 68 year young ladu from the Netherlands .And i looked at all youre songs and videos and i must say you are a true KINGSMAN at what you do !!!! Please stay save and well because i like to hear so much more ......untill then .....much love
W.o.w. 🔥🔥🔥
I just listened to this for the first time and the one where you’re arguing with yourself a few minutes ago. I don’t know if you’re a genius or not and not bothered either way but I thought this younger generation was fucked but  turns out there’s a little light in all the fuckery. Nice one mate. ✌️+❤️=😀
Another masterpiece!
Hamilton who?
I love the narritive to this piont and not just the parts that lead to this but to the story of Ren's creation and damnation to this point. I think people with hear and see but never get the story of a person damed to there person. The people stick are either sick or otherwise and they feel damnation wether sick or alive and what i love about your music is its spoken insane but its real about the people and how they feel is the same.
Amazing song but I want more seashells /hj
Yes ❤
"I ALMOST HAD FOOCKING EVERYTHING!!"
peaky blinders lookin different
I’m literally just finishing the song and I drive by a bus that’s wrapped with the Jimmy fund symbol and it says we’re all Jimmy 😂😂😂
Absolutely Amazing!  ❤❤❤
Why don't you try changing....
Ahhhhhhhhggg, woohoo fkn young legend
that 18 line is fire and so true one of the realest things I've heard. Love from America<3
Its SO Good your the Best REN!❤❤❤❤
MASTERPIECE.
Nigga looks like a 20 yr old Thomas Shelby
Masterpiece!! Unreal <3
The beat is not the same as the first 2. I mean it's still a good song that just buts me.
Damn. Just damn.
Man… Tommy Shelby REALLY wanted out of the lifestyle…
Wow
Amen my brother.
Yeah, at least the kid in your story did better than you. Without S.T.E.M and capitalism you wouldn't be where you are today. You, and all those who proclaim they want financial independence, be the next entrepreneur, you all depend on other roles and others who work jobs you hate, don't like, don't even have the skillset or talents to even do them. Shout out to the 100,000s of millions of billions of people that made this possible for you. Now get lost you anti-capitalist-nope-antithesis of impunity!😂😂
I wish at the end of the song  And Jimmy sold seashells by the seashore
The one who i placed trust in once apon a time, been a while though those where different times though
Wow just wow! You are honestly my favorite musician, your storytelling and rhythm are so good
I watched 1 - 3 just now. WOW! Ren your music is fuckin great. Thank you for everything you put into it. That series is a downer but then again...the truth hurts.
I should probably delete that last comment ... ??? Sounds a bit crazy and random. LOL!!!!!!!! :(....
This is thee sickest poem and theme music.. wait ... isn't that what a song is? I apologize we seem to having technical difficulties....  I love you - The Almighty  So that just came through for you  as for me I love your style and perception and self expression. The rest of us are in deer in headlights mode most if not all the time so thank you for being a spokesperson for our group (our meaning your fans - duh).
It’s beyond scary when you can see how the game we’re all playing, some more willingly than others, some with more luck than they realise, is leading us.
Storytellers are my favorite ❤
Insane!!!!
Wwaa, ....
u...are an absolute genius Ren.......never stop doing what u do....pure Talent
I felt it being in a wheelchair at 38 and now 42.  Truly amazing 👏
Wow😮❤
♥♥♥♥♥ That boy named Jimmy.
Dude, You need to come to Joao Pessoa! You need a HUG
This was absolutely riveting. Powerful. Beautifully presented. Wow.
Wow. I would love to see a movie with you. You would be an incredible character actor. The music videos with their stories already captivate me. How incredibly good would a movie have to be in which you could play a role for hours on end? I would love to see it.
Am I the only one who wants to see Ren play either the Joker or the villain of Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock? 😁
I believe this is one of the best songs, stories and music videos I may have ever seen... It would be amazing if you would tour with your music but also do like live plays with these amazing story lines   Cheers
Brilliant
This is tuff 🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
The youth of the nation ... Appears promising .
REN
I underestimated the song. I regret. I underestimated the message, I was wrong. Is it underestimated?! Ask yourself. Fking Fire. Fuck you.
fantastic and unique as always, dunno how you're gonna beat these tracks, but looking forward to your new releases
What are all these? AI posts 🤷🏻‍♂️, they don’t feel real. Let me write mine 🤓   It’s okay but some of it is bollocks, nothing i havent seen before and nothing i wont or you won’t see again, same old recycled lyrics, nothing even happens just the next generation thinks its new. 🙄
ABSOLUTE MASTER PIECE
Am I the only one who thought "my solution?" would be followed by "Revolution"?
Leaving Another  for the Algo 🎉❤!
This dude needs to be protected at all costs because he is creating a whole other level of art and we gotta see what it leads to.
Masterpiece
The way he looks at the gun and takes a deep breath, that looks like someone who's done that before. Makes me feel even more for Ren, knowing how hard his struggles have been and yet he continues to pull through and then use that experience to help those of us who need it.
Dude is a genius!🤯
everything about this is mind blowing. It's so good!
Mr. Shelby? That you?
Holy shit. Don't really have anything productive to say since I've just been floored by what I watched so I'm just leaving something to algo boost.
This is 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I watch the money game trilogy at least once a month. I know plenty of other young people are disgusted by late stage capitalism's demand for violence and oppression, but it's rare to have a productive and affirming chat about it. It's hauntingly lonely to think about so often when most people gave up caring before 20. Money Game parts 1 through 3 remind me that a cultural revolution is yet brewing, and I may live to see humans care for humans on a systemic level.
Duuuuddddeeee . I was starting to think I am wasting my time and fooling my self for writing stuff like this thinking it is actual art and genius.  People are never ever going to even pay enough attention to read between the lines and actually get how “deep” and “different “ I am. Thank you REN, I heard you so that I could SEE you.
Is this about McAfee? :D
I just found you and I am in LOVE ❤
Repeatedly blown the f away. MEGALITHIC TALENT! The full body enotional response I feel is what people live thier lives for. REN, THANK YOU! I am moved to my core!  Fan for life! Hope for humanity.  We  still have the ability to produce such profound craft.  So raw. So genuine. Today might be the first day of the rest of my life!
Fit as he looks like somebody out of peaky blinders can't get better
A female version by Chinchila would be good, females have a whole other level of what you are told, taught, and responsible for....not to include the 1/4 women who are graped by 16 and the warnings we get taught. If you get harassed scratch their skin so your fingernails will have the DNA etc. Scream Fire instead of HELP or GRAPE as you are more likely to get a response. The list goes on. What each sex is taught is different, a woman taught those skills through 0 - 18 would use it differently.
I think you could make a great theatre show from Rens music
Hell yeah
Shared with family and friends.  A great work.
Jamaican a listen
This man has tremendous skills! However.. Utopia is not possible on this planet. A borderless world would be a chaotic world, as there will always be plenty who will take all they can w/o respect for others, and then move to the next land until it is all devoted.  A global govmt will form, which will be to far from the people and having way to much power to be of the people, there will be no redress of grievances, nor justice for the victimized.  America was heading on the right track, until the leftist neo Marxist fascists began infiltrating education and then politics, opening the borders w/o care, taking the taxes from those who worked and gave to those who take (which is basically what Marxism is).  His art is amazing, but his philosophy is sadly still immature.
Im over 60 an this young man is exceptionally talented story telling acting musical talent rap singing ren really has it all i will keep saying it ren the musical 🎶
I have said he needs to do a musical 🎶 it would be epic his songs so far have all been mini musicals so a full musical is within his capabilities i wiah he would i think it woyld be epic
I love this! Everything is 👌 If I could create a loop of the sound between 1:40 and 2:10I would listen to it until I can sing it perfectly with you❤ I don’t know why I like so much, my soul is just hooked!!✨🙏
On a dark rain soaked evening Jimmy confronted the ghosts of his past the life driven by greed, ambition and a thirst for wealth that had rendered him a prisoner of his making. With a trembling hand on a 45 caliber  he whispered the echoes of his father’s lessons the tragedy of a life devoted to a money game. As he pressed the trigger, a final desperate culmination of lessons unlearned, both from his father and the world he had navigated resonated in that last moment. It was a story of a boy named Jimmy who had once desired the world but ended with nothing but the absence of his own humanity.
I keep coming back, over and over, a loop in my brain straight in the vein. They say conscious rap is not entertainment,  but it's reality. I would rather hear the truth than hear stats and plays, I have turned many into renegades.. renegade in retrograde
From the USA, sweet heart... your a fucking genius.  You speak the truth. Breaks my heart because we are all just puppets in their show. The day we opt out or dare to speak out, they kill us.   🙏🦋🍄🌻💔🤞
This piece is amazing.
"Money is the means to all ends" should be humanities motto.
Of Stories old, they always said those would come to try and awaken us and save us from the maddness in which we live. Prophet's have come and gone leaving there words in books to force us to see sense, but nobody reads any more. The last horse rides in tones and tongue, a last attempt, singing in tunes and rhymes to grab our attentions to the only cause. Wakeup, see the day.
Tommy Shelby, is that you?!
Yuh
James Bond kinda tune
❤
I haven't seen iT yeat... but. . I ALREADY KNOW, IT WOULD BE BEST! CAUSEu Are! 4Ever!
Holy fucking shit
My brother might not have killed himself after hearing your work, or at least it would have brought him some relief. Thanks
I just found this guy and im going through his music this he is on his own level
Favourite artist right now by far
Wow what a master piece well done ren amazing brother
Tell prof I am saddened after the showing in bozeman 😢 reach out. ❤️
How about a serie of collaborations between you guys @RenMakeMusic @TomMacDonaldOfficial @Thatsdax World needs to listen to music talking about reality. Just think about it and you will see the results. Thanks me later!!😊
What's sad is the probably hundreds of thousands of real talented genius like Ren that were passed over and left to waste by institutions like Hollywood that didn't want artists, but wanted to find obedient slaves they could use to exploit and corrupt society. His music is so refreshing because rarely do artists have the ability to figure out how to spread their music without becoming a puppet of the gruesome and debauched people in power in politics and Hollywood. Hopefully the whole Diddy thing marks a change in how artists get discovered and developed so that we see many more artistic genius like Ren and Sam.
Exploring your work tonight. The mindset behind this is brilliant & speaks volumes. Thank you! ❤
Dude should have played Thomas Shelby's son in Peaky Blinders. Looks very much like him.
So many things I want to say. Deep thoughts. I can’t abridge.
Another masterpiece. You are amazing Ren, thank you for this!
I just found Rens music and this is by far the greatest music I've listen in a long Time.
I love u❤ yet Sir I do agree to disagree with full love 💕
dose anyone else think they should make another perge and play one of Ren's songs in it.
Whats up the wheelchair im paralyzed in wheelchair 😂
😢
Dude Ren you don't muss! Fire
Ren, i wish you were my son. You genious, you...    love
5:48 is the best Part in the whole Video.
I love this song but I cannot share "suicide".  On all levels, when you pull that trigger its final.  There's no take backs no matter where that metal slug is headed.  There's always another way besides a gun in personal crisis.  "Light up the darkness" -BM
I'm not going to repeat a load of already-made comments; we know this is a work of art. I'm just going to add a couple of observations on the video I've not seen made.  First, is it just serendipity that the globe stops spinning at the exact moment Ren answers the phone? With all the meticulous planning, I couldn't say.   Second, when he stands up and says, "This isn't entertainment...," we get a couple of lines that remind me, from the cadence, of Shakespeare.  I can't recall the play that it reminded me of, but, if I'm right, it just seems another example of all the references you get from a Ren video
aint no way we got this before gta 6
Thats amazing holy
Literally, I just love this one 💛 thanks for sharing your talents with us 🔥Meanstoanend
Amazing
I'm old school and this is proper hard lyrical music that means something
That was awesome bro!
Ren inspires me been along time.  Thanks for the passion

I like your music
I am from Denmark and my name is crazy is
CollE. Nummer 🎉😂
bro, it's soooooo cooool!!
I stumbled across Ren just recently and I will say every piece he puts out tells a story that strikes so deep with everyday struggles in life. Masterpiece 🤌🏼
Oh yea
Wtf is that 😮😮😮my mind is blown
Even though this may not be MY type of music, ren has created such an amazing community that I love to talk with and his music sends out real messages that the world needs to focus on more. Good job Ren! Keep working hard and keep doing what you love!
Wow
Masterpeace
Where in the hell did you come from??? You're blowing my mind!! Genius!!
I found him One year after he blew up, what is happening to me
Marry me ❤
Not music videos these are performance art, amazing talent (still looks like Tommy Shelby!)
why did the name Bush come to  my mind
This video was the recommended vid after I watched Froggy Fresh's "Good Guy Shoes" where if you wear the shoes, you'll turn into the "red headed evil Irish Doug who's just a thug". YT must've thought there were similarities in the two videos 🤔 🤣
Lyrics:  Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy One years old and his first words were mine, mine gimme Two years old, he was walking, three years old, walking quickly Four years old, he was running around the pavements of his city Five years old, and his daddy told him, listen here son, you've got to learn to be a man A man he works for what he wants Six years old, and he's reading, writing, top of the bunch And when he's seven, his progression made him student number one Eight years old and he's praised for unusual grades Nine, his parents pay for private school to nurture the flame 10, 11, 12, 13, he ascends and ascends, his daddy tells him, son, money is the means to all ends 14 solving complex mathematic equations, at 15, IQ 150, still elevating 16 he develops complex software code that detects weaknesses in cyber security protocol 17, and he sells his vision, keeping the share, not yet an adult But he's practically a millionaire 18, and his daddy tells him now you're a man the world don't give a damn about you So take all that you can 19, he turns a profit, stocks and shares, invest in product 20, double down deposits 21, his income rockets 22, he learns that truth is just an obstacle to wealth If you manipulate the data, then the lie will sell itself 23, a life of luxury Crystal and cocaine 24, he makes the Forbes list, they're applauding his name 25, and his daddy told him, listen here, son, while you're sitting in the palace That don't mean that you won 26, his business shifts, he switches business to arms He's 27, dealing nuclear shells in Iran 28, inside the Senate, money bought him a seat He's 29, role of counsel in the president suite And now he's 30, his daddy says, you're losing the race You're just a servant to the king, not even in second place 31, a big maneuver for his daddy's approval Moving imports over borders from the exports out of Cuba 32, moving grams, growing kilo to tons He's 33, filling warehouses with powder and guns 34, turf war with nobody to stop it, blind eye from the Po po inside of his pocket 35, he gets a call, I'm sorry, son, but it's your father, had a heart attack I'm sorry, he's gone, 36, getting pissed off abusing this product 37, eyes glazed, disposition demonic 38, with a prostitute, a moment of passion Heating up the silver spoon and then chasing the dragon 39, getting reckless and hungry for power Daddy's words still driving him to kill him and devour He makes a move against the cartel, but the strategy's flawed They retaliate and leave him in the hospital ward A bullet buried in his vertebra, and one in his leg The doctor sighs and says, I don't think you'll be walking again, fuck Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy He was 40 and he cursed the words mine, mine gimme 41, he wasn't walking, 42, not walking quickly, 43 Never running round the pavements of his city 44 inside a palace with a mountain of gold But those riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves Weighing heavy on his conscience is the value of gold, Lamborghini for a life Trading money for souls, Jimmy followed the code inside the land of the free Put your hand inside the cookie jar, take more than you need And his example is exaggerated versions of me, and it's a version of him And it's a version of she, and it's a version of you There's no escaping the blame, the way we live, it's parasitic Fuck the money and fame, cut the music This isn't entertainment, this is real life, the way we live is lunacy, community it declines We're hyperpolarized, we're always fighting and we divide Truth is less important than the money that we designed? Money's an invention, politics from our invention, they all come from people's ideas Did I mention, border's an invention Law and order fuels the tension that leads to people killing each other My solution? Everything is subject to change We could build utopias if individuals were taught to use their brains But if we teach kids in schools to always be sheep and put themselves before the herd If there's more money for meat Then there's no future I see where the humans survive We're parasites inside the Petri dish, with cannibal mines Mold will grow upon the surface, then consumes 'til it dies And our fate could be the same without this story to the wise 45, Jimmy comes home out of the rain, soaking wet upon a wheelchair Drinking again, he has everything he wants, he has fortune and fame Such a fortunate fool with an unfortunate fate with a 45 caliber aimed at his brain 45, a fitting number because his age is the same Here's the words of his father, it's such a damn shame Then he presses on the trigger of a money game
Just listening the money game 1,2&3. And number 1 the lyrics especially about immigration really really aged well. Sadly we still thinking the same way and the riots starting c
Well done sir.
Love your thoughts!
He's the Willy Wonka of rap music
I love to see you grow man. When I discovered you, you had 30.000 subscriptions. I watched you land hit after hit and soon, you'll be fame. We are growing steadily and without realising, you'll play the big stages soon.  Love you, for entertainment, passion, the darkness of your soul, the sharpness of your brain and the light in your heart.  Greetings from Germany...as always
Truth. Ren is a genius. ❤
Einfach nur wow
Absolutely love this. Every moment is captivating, Excellent work all round.
Visual artist. Poet. Musician. This is the kind of man who's art would once have been funded by the absurdly wealthy as patrons.
yeah,the education system has been cannibalised. It's so fkd.
Pov:your on ur way to commit a felony this is the song in ur listening and the police give u extra time in jail bc of it
Awesomeness
All though most ppl think that its just a theatrical poem.... They dont give a second thought to how others think or may think and the consequences of that. ( LIFE IS HARD )  REN BE WELL BROTHER!
Holy Christ this beautiful man is a genius! Absolutely remarkable Ren you leave me speechless and wanting more 💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋
Watched this enough times that I've got to ask... was that poor violinist supposed to get soaked?🤣 She handled it so well
Another great piece of art Ren!! I love it.
🐐
Love that shot  0:41
What Ren manage to do with Money Game, Hi Ren, the trilogy, su!cIde etc., is a gift to us all. Not only for the brilliance of it in terms of art, not only for the truth and acknowledgment that he gives but also for the millions of reactions of deferent people on youtube who provide us with different perspectives from their respective background whether that is rap, vocals, guitar, theater, therapy, life in general, everything. It gives us, and the hopefully the future humanity a proper school.
that was.. wow
Left without words that would say anything, pure art.
Love the rawness approach that hits straight to the point. Always respect/appreciate it; thank you!
Ren holds up the Mirror that we need to see, we HAVE, to see if things even stand a chance to change. We are under the powerful illusion that we are powerless to change anything, that all we can do is 'participate' in the system in order to survive. Ren shows us the truth. The Truth that change not only starts with US but that the horrendous outcome if we don't is not a possibility but a certainty! To do nothing is ALSO a choice!
Just discovered Ren last night and so far I've enjoyed EVERYTHING I've heard from him. With all the trite out nowadays it is so refreshing to hear such an original artist, and one with a message to boot. Just loving this discovery.
Just Awesomeness!! So great, All!
Amazing work and artistry and feeling. It's so true we built this construct and they make us less human.
When's the Broadway play coming out💯
Rhyme still slaps.
Hi Ren, thanks for both of your sides. Both are important for this Story.
Nice!!
For real ren deserves way more notoriety keep up the good work man ❤
Anything Ren does gets me totally investing my full attention. ❤
ive just watched a 5 series tv show in 9 minutes
Seminal. Sublime. Perfect.
U are something truly special,  i haven't been able to get enough since i first heard hi-ren! Thank u for being so wonderfully unique  ❤
@ren ive been at my lowest recently. Just know you've saved my life. You was the loose in my noose man. Im still at the bottom but i know there is hope and it will find me soon i hope.
Ren ist Killing it once again
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤 PURE ART
Jesus Christ that’s strong 🔥👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
☄
Shit! I mean wow
If you don't believe in God and good, you can surely see evil. And that, and in essence this song, is what helped bring me back to religion when I once thought I was smart enough or versed enough to discount it.
truly a modern version of pink floyd's "the wall" it's a shame culture is dead
Bro why can I play your whole library w minimal commercials? Monetize brov
My heart was beating like I'd run a mile, and I had no idea until ended. My God, this is an artist.
This is just mad
I am waiting for part 4
You have the best songs
fucking brilliant this is real art
I resonate with you so much. I love your music, your energy, your passion for what you do.. YOu are a pleasure to listen to Ren and I look forward to more of your music, as always <3  Cheers buddy
If we all lived in a Utopia, wouldn't it be mighty boring?  It is the same as I've considered about "heaven".  Perfect all the time, perfect all you know, eventually someone is going to break the mold.  As long as there is humanity, Utopia will never, can never exist.
a true artist. uniquely British
Chills every time
Ren om Norwegian means clean/pure-like his truth,art in philosophy, music , acting,filming,directing, pure art speaking of real dillemas -of the insane reality were living
Every time I watch this video, I always wonder how successful the father was. Clearly not as "successful" as his son, yet he kept telling him it wasn't good enough. Even as a senator. These types of stories happen all too often IRL.
"Good art should make you think, and great art should change the way you think"
How does he just writes 10 minute songs and they still are one of if not the best things iv ever heard
How do you like this AI-generated music? https://youtu.be/KbHJKhXeBNo
This is absolutely fuggin amazing 😮 Definitely A Masterpiece ❤
wow I need a moment after this masterpiece
Just WOW!!!!
Is this about MrBeast?

Holy shit... that was *really* well put together. No words can encapsulate how great that was.

Dear Ren  https://youtu.be/EEU-6oDw5-U?si=P4AhMlgKvjn3jdqL
Isn't it super exciting to have Ren barge into the music world with supercharged energy and mind blowing lyrics. I am so enjoying your ride my friend. Especially lately, you realised you can make your own beats...just listen to your heart in the silence x
wow
fire
Also leaving a comment for the algorithm. "Imagine a world where money is no longer a concern. What would you choose to do?"
Thanks also at the beautiful orchestra! I was at the verge of tears at the part when the orchestra played.
You are so creative I love it

Is it sad that I as an American know just by the sound of him holding the gun and racking it that it's plastic?

Can't believe I just stubbled on to his music. Just wow. Absolutely an artist the music is phenomenal and the videos just put it over the top.
New❤Subscriber here! Dear Ren, I hope you see this comment & know how AMAZING & BLESSED you are!  I just found your channel today (via a *KNOX H.* reaction video) I've viewed your story, along with some other videos that are TOTALLY captivating!  I'm absolutely amazed at how *uniquely talented YOU are* (in so many ways), and you're truly an *eloquent story teller* It's like watching a short film that is sincerely deep & very thought provoking!  You're a *TRUE ARTIST* and a *LEGIT SAVANT!*  Your other videos (that I've seen so far) are absolutely stunningly poetic, brilliant & beautiful in such a unique way!
REN...WOW...BRAVO!!! 👏👏👏 *THIS was DEEPLY PROFOUND & THOUGHT PROVOKING!!!!*
There are so many layers to this. Musically, it is exceptional.
Hi! I am new here. But. On the topic of greed I instatly went to the tragedy of the commons. https://youtu.be/CxC161GvMPc?si=p5P99pp8ZXOVpolr Basically, it says that every gain  you get in a closed system of recoures, you will have it at someone elses loss. AND that benefit will realize for the first mover. You will do it because any downside of your actions will be shared. You have the gain but share the consequences. This is greed for me. But also, it is motivation system to be reconcideted. We are not one person for personal gaim. We are not alone and affraid. Sentimental, I know. With Ren it's not so much about the music - which i do love - but principle, the topic and public person.
Wow. Love this.
I'm alive at the same time as a legend
The art from you Ren is unbelievable.    The way you tell the story with the show that goes with it is totally refreshing.  I'm 53 years old and I salute you brother
i think 1.6mil is a bit less for you buddy...
Yessssss
Whattup Ren? Thank You. And. You should check out The Krizz Kaliko reactions to some of your songs. Especially for I shot the sheriff with your band. Peace
HOLD UP THIS WAS ALL DONE IN 1 TAKE?!
Wow
One word “Poetry”
You are so incredibly incredible.  Every bit of you.  Thank you for sharing your beautiful mind & voice with the world
Preach! ❤

I wish you amazing days ahead ❤. Your music and the messages in them is literally beautiful yet heartbreaking, but you also speak so much truth in them. And the truth is what we need right now.
I mean... its a masterpiece...
Fuck, I need a poet to even leave a comment for this!
Ren, you are what people need, really.. Thank you for your music, for real, nothing compares to what you've been bringing, truth to open peoples minds.
Just discovered ren..... im glad i clicked this recommendation ❤
If this isnt greatness and skill i dont know what is
Just outstanding.  Such talent.
Ren ypu are genius❤
A massive new fan, I love your music and all your creative visions.
Wow, what a masterpiece. True art in every sense of the word. I was going to compare this to some great musicians, playwriters and novelists but that wouldn't be fair. Ren is in league of his own and, if anything, others aught to be compared to him.
Im just speechless ...
I was just about to say why not remake the beat and re release SB. Glad you are bro! 👊🏻
Jesus that left me floored
❤❤
Plot twist is the Bullet didn't fire and in the pouring rain Jimmy had a epiphany. He went on to use his wealth, arms contacts and Genius level Programing skills to be a sort of Red Hood  / Batman / Iron Man like figure but with less to no  Morals
Damn what the fvck this i just watch😂 it seemed like 2mins. Just realized its actually over 9mins😂😂
i never had heard about this man.... and today is a happy day for me. this man dont rap or sing..... hes making art. such a diferent way of storytteling. And the clip man , the guy behind this camera is a genius 2.  much freaking love from portugal. keep making art. U touch my soul brother, GOD bless you
this will go down in history as a MASTERPIECE. . . .. but please do check out the brit and American versions of tv series, UTOPIA. . .and  brit's THE FEED. its THEM, giving notice
This is beautiful and true.
this fucken money game drains the purpose of life from life itself, and left us all hollow from inside.
our life is a money game, well said bro, loved it but feel ashamed to be a tiny part of it.
Every time I watch this I get more and more impressed with Sam's camera skills like goddamn  Also Ren playing the piano at the beginning. Like, I'm not very good at piano, but that didn't look easy
Fucking Genial!!! I love it! ❤
My dude...
I just discovered you, and as an American lawyer who comes from a working class dad with a money mentality - I COULD NOT relate more. Just hearing this song has re-motivated me in my practice and how to approach it. Thank you for your art. I needed to hear this today.
Doubt I'm the demographic but man I love your rhymes & beats Ren - is there anything you're not a Master at?!
1:40 to 2:12 gives me phenomenal Bond theme song vibes
Thank you for giving us your art
Hey Ren, I’m Ren too. Just like me, you’re really talented ❤✅🔥… Love from Congo
❤Best song ever!! Some of the best quotes ive ever heard, best movie ive ever watched, best rhythm, best melody ... all the best for the Kujo case
That video is theatre! Top notch!
Wowwwww you are brilliant!
Now this is art, innovative and inventive. 1❤
My husband and I think you are so super talented and WOW a Genius artist. 🤗
It's been some time since we've seen such creative genius.   Your musical abilities with your lyric abilities tied to your intellectual poise.   Our kids need more creative role models like you.  I'm grateful to have found your art to experience it.   TY for your work! ❤❤❤
My favorite song and sick boy also am so made at beat stars for takeing it down
The white bag isn't on properly his neck isn't red when he takes it of
Who is this guy? Finally find some artist here! Thank you Ren!
You are the second artist I have ever said "I hope you blow up" true art
Never been so excited to share something with the world and nervous at the same time
What a once -in-generation talent. He's the spirit child of Basquiat, Gary Oldman and Sting.
Money means nothing if you don’t have love
REN, Please do some tours in SWFL.  You are freaking awesome!
Is he actually alright….like I’m general? I’m here for you if you need bro
The darkness you have made into such a beautiful rhyme, beautiful poem🎶 I got goosebumps from these lyrics. Thank🎉😊 you. For sharing and caring, you have no idea what an impact you have on me, and I know so many others as well.  I truly appreciate you♥️🙏🏼❤
Comment for the algorithm
So heavy
Brilliant love it hi ren very clever man
This is BRILIANT!!!
Wow man !! I'm about to go out on the 1st date nite in years and you got me in tears 😢. AWESOME TRACK AGAIN!!! . JUST KEEP DOING YOU  👍
While the story is compelling and the music excellent, the people portrayed here will never off themselves. They die of very very old age .
That whistle
ABSOLUTELY LOVELY,  HAD TO GET AN EARLY AM LISTEN TO THIS ENTIRE MASTERPIECE ❤🎉😊
i just cry to every song he makes🥺
Masterpiece of art , amazing way to give life to your piece
Amazing. So clever
Music should tell a story. A story is best told by music. I’m not sure what you are doing Ren, because what you do is beyond normalcy. You do not channel emotion into your music, you channel music into your emotions. Lovely
thomas shelby meets eminem
Bard of Truth
Put your hand inside the cookie jar ,and take more than you need.
Fantastic video directions.....the music is strong...try to keep it up 🎉coppola/tarantino
you guys are not doing videoclip u're doing master piece in the short films environment
Blessed to hear your music ren u help a lot of people hope you know that…
I first listened to this in the background at work (I always need noise and ether have music or documentaries) and it made me stop work to watch the full 9+minutes.  I've rewatched it since and it's still capturing and gives me chills. All of your music is indescribably amazing.
Holy fuuuuuuccccckkkkkk!!!!!
And I love to slap the greedy 😂
And I love to slap the greedy 😂
This man straight up doesnt fkn miss. Lyrically, visually, metaphorically, story telling. Absolute goat 🐐
fantastic. The musical equivalent to Hogarth. Stunning
I was there for the debut, and have been supporting a lot of reactors. Now it's time to help get the views up on your page.  Loved this and support you 100%. I really hope Kujo wakes up and just goes away quietly...
Wonderfull, and nicely anti system. Love it, thankyou.
This guy has totally overdosed Eminem. He's pathetic 😢
HI Ren Never give up! It´s a hard way to work on your self but it´s worth! Don´t press the trigger on the Money game
Jimmy is sounding a lot like Mr Beast these days.
It's a mix between like a storytime channel and a music channel. It's definitely something special
Wer zum Teufel bist du ? 😳👌
Yet another masterpiece
Ren needs to get into acting
Fuckin legendary
fucking powerful stuff
Given the story being told, I can't help but wonder if 45 was chosen for more reasons that made apparent here.   Regardless, the talent on display is absolutely amazing. I have no doubt your music will touch the lives of people in profound ways.
Part 2!?¿ 😮 can’t wait!❤🎉
Bruh you fucking delivered on this one! (As usual) I can’t stop watching and smiling, greedy twats.
The Hangman! You're amazing!
Amazing. Excellent music and lyrics. Feeling perfectly the frustration and anger you feel from this entire unfair situation. Loving the video AND the disclaimer at the end. Some fans have taken upon themselves to reopload sick boi as a sign of support until you can get have yours back online. and I don't know how you might feel about it. I feel deeply sorry that this is happening to you when you truly seem to be doing things fairly and humanly.
110% correct there
Actual goosebumps.  Pure art!
67yr old and I love your music x
This is cinema. This is beautiful.  These are facts  Great work YG #FLORIDAMAN 🌴☠️🌴 🌊🖤🌊 🤙😎🤙
Amazing ❤
Cool video. Was that done as one long shot?
Ren, have you ever though of acting?... I see you sooo much in a tv series or a movie, the emotions that you let out in your videos are so raw, intense and real, it needs to be seen.
F.cking 🔥🔥🔥AF !!!!💯💯💯
Wow… I’m in actual shock right now. This was absolutely amazing. I saw him on TikTok just a few mins ago for the first time and become engrossed in his page. He’s so deep with these videos and touches on things that actually matters.
Shakespeare, Beethoven and Eminem in one.
So good!!
Mate, no words. Blessings all round and hopefully some soul searching and redemption for kujo, Christ 😂.  Don't fuck with the boy who's been through the fire and offered his heart, that’s bad juju that
Well done
I think it comes from fear also😶
That. Was. Epic.
Damn...
OMG….WOW….
Ha!  That is fucking great!!!
REN 🔥💯 all is the TRUTH 😈
Wow. Ren you are a fecking genius... Lessons for all not to fuck you off..
You are an absolute genius 🤷🏻‍♀️
Triple dog dare kijo nasty gf to comment!  WE NEED A PART 2! 💪🏻💪🏻
You Sir.... are a genius....love your creations..  from one nut job to another... I salute you.❤
Share, share, and share some more.  Let it play on repeat on your ohone whilst you sleep.  We need to be behind Ren 100%. Its the best way to stick it to that shitgibbon K*j*beats.
Poetic Justice!! Holy Shit!! Amazing 👏
All in one take !!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
great talent
❤❤❤❤ watched the video last week and what an absolute story.. you gave out not olive branch but the whole farm and he just decided to burn it. Amazing story, brilliantly written and can't wait for Sick boi part 2 to be released
Kujo may not deserve to riddled with abuse but should be riddled with guilt for his part in this. To play part in one of Rens main frustrations only further proves Ren's music as socialogically true
Another banger per usual.
Musically impeccable. Lyrically connectable.  Never doubt a Man determined.  Appreciate you and ALL of YOUR work Ren! 💪🏻💪🏻
❤
Hi Ren, respect mate. Found out about you this year a few months ago and went down a huge Rabbit hole of your catalogue of unique work. Initially not my type of jam, you converted me to your world building, story telling and song writing ability. You video and song Ren spoke volumes to myself and others I told to watch your work. Having mental health issues myself it related to me big time and a work of genius. I seen your vid concerning the pig chasing pennies they don't deserve. I support what you had to say and enjoyed this "part one" keep up the great work and I truly wish better health kid. All the best, and dont let the bastards grind you down. J
Wowwww!!!! This is fucking ridiculous if I'm being Honest.... If Your not onto Ren and his Artistry by now, your genuinely missing out!!!! 🎯💯✅
Quality :) Bring on part 2
I love this!
ABSOLUTE LEGEND... when you dragged his bird into the shot.... 💀💀💀😂😂
Booooooossssshhhhhhhhffffff my fellow beautifully fkd up soul
Wow that’s so fucking saveage
Sometimes people just need a little reminder how to behave ❤
That was epic
I hope you don’t look back at this in couple of years and feel a bit silly   It’s a great track. Maybe I’m too old and sick of tit for tat stuff.  I know it means a lot to you. So big up on that.  Sometimes tho silence is louder than noise   Scott
Beautiful film work 🙌
Brilliant.
holy shit. I need pt2. this was sick.
Sick Boi fucking growling - good to see the Napoleon mask make a welcome show. Holy crap this is absolutely immense Ren, those is the back were haunting.  Loved it.
This is fucking amazing.
Thank you. Your music is amazing.
I’m so happy I randomly stumbled on to your channel love the music and the message! CANT WAIT FOR Kujo beat down 💪🏽💪🏽
Legendary as always Ren 👏🏼
Listening again. Just amazing.
Ren exudes such an invigorating energy when he performs it's as if it reaches out of our cell phones or computers or whatever the audience is watching from and it pulls you back in with it captivating all your senses and it's like your there in person watching him feeling all the feels
damn.
That beginning masterpiece brought me to tears 😍
This production should be a classic in the music and video industry.  Everything is incredibly magnificent, the structure, the composition, the writing, the artistic direction..  All technical and artistic fields should serve as a reference here.  Thank you for being able to give us that in this generation.
funniest thing ever to hear from right wing is when they talk about money problems. Every right winged party in power ever has only made it worse. Its always the same song. Lend more as a government so the people can see a lot of change. Leave the country in even more depth afterwards but that they don't see. Never ever has the right fixed anything ever. Left isn't the answer either every extreme is bad. Be right when you need to be, be left when you need to be. How bout balance people? Isn't that how the world works best? In balance.. Extremes are (almost) never the correct answer in any direction. That'd be a great start. This way everyone should be able to go along and you would be much, much happier with a balanced life and government.
Powerful dialogue , all the lyrics. Incredible truly.
That last scene gave me chills bro
Absoluter Wahnsinn....ich feier ihn so krass...geiler geht nicht...love him
Still hits me hard 🤍
Just after the song I got an ad for a trading app This feels like some messed up yet genius joke
💜
Superb
Ren  you are  light!!! I know what your going through Brother♡.+
This guys a genius wordsmith.
Never gets old! Cheers bro
Slow clap...what a masterpiece.
Hi Ren. You're fvcking amazing!!
Genius ❤
I want to hear the song before you was interrupted
Wow
What happened to Stimpy tho?
Ren is a zen to the Gen! He is more than a rapper he's a trapper, your trapped in his closet!
This is so good. I'm in awe.
He's like singing George Carlin!  Using his music in new and very impactful ways to drive home the social commentary.  I love him.
Leaving a comment for algorithm
God, I need this intro 😍 I need more
i am speechless.
Daamn Daamn Daamn! This gives chills to the bone
Dope as always  Greatly talented person  Awesome as well  Thanks Ren 🤘 😎👍
What to say that already hasn't...❤
🔥🔥🔥 can’t believe this is nearly a year old! The build up was just epic! So glad to have been a part of it!
Current favorite artist.
It's good music when it gives you goosebumps. 🙌
He truly is talented.
CUT THE MUSIC!!!  Feelings..
Oh yes one for the algorithm! This is sick!
Best thing ever!
🔥 damn! Just found ren and i can't stop listening.
Genius!
Genius
Thank you Ren for sharing your artistic talent with us all!!🎉❤😊
Listen to Fj outlaws song the addiction also you can see an influence in his as well major props.
Not knocking religion as a Christian myself I say not as a mockery in no sense but music through deep testimonial soul touching music, there's a path that is easily guided to take these proverbial rabbit holes in our own conscious that can so easily paint such a scenic landscape that it can almost become an alternate reality, a place to escape or a comforting place of acceptance in our heads a place where not only do you feel, and understand, and accept the music but the music understands and accepts you as well so atleast for a brief moment we get to leave the stress and rigor of the mundane everyday rat race called life. Like the Bible does for many you can hear or read the same thing over and it evolves to something of a different feeling or perspective of how you receive it depending on your mental state at that particular moment.
Almost had a les miserablas feel to it if you ever get the chance to see it I highly recommend it "all of this over a loaf of bread"
OMG does this man know how to relate a story to make you feel it. This is Fckn deep, well done Ren.
Your gift is beautiful. And honest. And REAL. I have MAD respect for you, to have the courage to speak up for those who aren't able. Never stop doing what your doing. You are the light in the darkness, and I feel so blessed to have literally stumbled upon your amazing works of art.
Ren is right handed - he wouldnt be able to rotate pew pew that way..that’s either him and the pew pew, points left to the forward, or a left handed props put it down..
love the end
Finde Eminem und Ren sollten ein gemeinsam Song machen die beiden auf ein track darüber werden die Menschen noch in 100 Jahren sprechen
Great, great, great! Absolutely brilliant. Such great storytelling.
@RenMakesMusic The solution- Can you elaborate for me @RenMakesMusic? Is that greed should kill itself? Or the greedy?  Changing the world Ren! Good onya braddah🤙ThankYOU
🥰 ❤
Keep it up butt smashing it
Every time i hear it chills me bones.
still love this
Where's your lyrics? I love you! You're beautiful inside and out 💓
Talent
I can't say enough about this song but that vocal change and in the MV the picking up of the champagne flute (also heard in audio) is truly incredible. It makes all of the difference without knowing it does.
❤
I'm nearly 50 and discovered Ren & Kendrick this year,   I'm excited about music again. !
Felt this ❤
No one compares to you Ren. I'm 64 and so proud that I got to find you and hear your words of wisdom through your music. You are 1 in a millon a star shining so bright that others can not ignore your messages of hope. Mankind, i too have multiple illnesses with 68 allergies to medicines, foods and the environment. You make me feel like I fit in where others don't understand how hard it is to live in a body that you have no control over. Thank you Ren for being you and staying true to yourself we all adore you. You are a star 🌟
Well, it's a style on his on. This is art and this is great art.
Damn he look like he could be in pinky blinders 😎
Thank you. Greetings from Greece.
Tallented AF
It’s scary when you hear lyrics that speak like the words you have written in your own journal about life, people, tragedy, despair, and the never ending hypocrisy that comes with life and our choices. It’s comforting and surreal and it makes me feel like maybe my brain isn’t as crazy and confused as I thought. Or maybe it is…if it is, at least I know I’m not completely alone ❤️‍🩹
Excelent production. However, you can't be a senator until you're 30....
Just…wow. I am simply amazed at your artistry. Heartbreaking and real.
Fucking brilliant 👏  Just found   this man 20 minutes ago after stubling upon "who is she" *edited to note the girl who sang in "Who Is she" was amazing as well
6:43 Feels real...
..if you manipulate the data, then a lie will sell itself.. "
Lyrics:  Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy One years old and his first words were mine, mine gimme Two years old, he was walking, three years old, walking quickly Four years old, he was running around the pavements of his city Five years old, and his daddy told him, listen here son, you've got to learn to be a man A man he works for what he wants Six years old, and he's reading, writing, top of the bunch And when he's seven, his progression made him student number one Eight years old and he's praised for unusual grades Nine, his parents pay for private school to nurture the flame 10, 11, 12, 13, he ascends and ascends, his daddy tells him, son, money is the means to all ends 14 solving complex mathematic equations, at 15, IQ 150, still elevating 16 he develops complex software code that detects weaknesses in cyber security protocol 17, and he sells his vision, keeping the share, not yet an adult But he's practically a millionaire 18, and his daddy tells him now you're a man the world don't give a damn about you So take all that you can 19, he turns a profit, stocks and shares, invest in product 20, double down deposits 21, his income rockets 22, he learns that truth is just an obstacle to wealth If you manipulate the data, then the lie will sell itself 23, a life of luxury Crystal and cocaine 24, he makes the Forbes list, they're applauding his name 25, and his daddy told him, listen here, son, while you're sitting in the palace That don't mean that you won 26, his business shifts, he switches business to arms He's 27, dealing nuclear shells in Iran 28, inside the Senate, money bought him a seat He's 29, role of counsel in the president suite And now he's 30, his daddy says, you're losing the race You're just a servant to the king, not even in second place 31, a big maneuver for his daddy's approval Moving imports over borders from the exports out of Cuba 32, moving grams, growing kilo to tons He's 33, filling warehouses with powder and guns 34, turf war with nobody to stop it, blind eye from the Po po inside of his pocket 35, he gets a call, I'm sorry, son, but it's your father, had a heart attack I'm sorry, he's gone, 36, getting pissed off abusing this product 37, eyes glazed, disposition demonic 38, with a prostitute, a moment of passion Heating up the silver spoon and then chasing the dragon 39, getting reckless and hungry for power Daddy's words still driving him to kill him and devour He makes a move against the cartel, but the strategy's flawed They retaliate and leave him in the hospital ward A bullet buried in his vertebra, and one in his leg The doctor sighs and says, I don't think you'll be walking again, fuck Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy He was 40 and he cursed the words mine, mine gimme 41, he wasn't walking, 42, not walking quickly, 43 Never running round the pavements of his city 44 inside a palace with a mountain of gold But those riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves Weighing heavy on his conscience is the value of gold, Lamborghini for a life Trading money for souls, Jimmy followed the code inside the land of the free Put your hand inside the cookie jar, take more than you need And his example is exaggerated versions of me, and it's a version of him And it's a version of she, and it's a version of you There's no escaping the blame, the way we live, it's parasitic Fuck the money and fame, cut the music This isn't entertainment, this is real life, the way we live is lunacy, community it declines We're hyperpolarized, we're always fighting and we divide Truth is less important than the money that we designed? Money's an invention, politics from our invention, they all come from people's ideas Did I mention, border's an invention Law and order fuels the tension that leads to people killing each other My solution? Everything is subject to change We could build utopias if individuals were taught to use their brains But if we teach kids in schools to always be sheep and put themselves before the herd If there's more money for meat Then there's no future I see where the humans survive We're parasites inside the Petri dish, with cannibal mines Mold will grow upon the surface, then consumes 'til it dies And our fate could be the same without this story to the wise 45, Jimmy comes home out of the rain, soaking wet upon a wheelchair Drinking again, he has everything he wants, he has fortune and fame Such a fortunate fool with an unfortunate fate with a 45 caliber aimed at his brain 45, a fitting number because his age is the same Here's the words of his father, it's such a damn shame Then he presses on the trigger of a money game

Man, you are absolutely something else, Ren. Please, keep making music.
How do you play that piano bit at the start
Stumbled just now on this man… it’s been two hr emotional roller coster & never have I heard this much talent, authenticity, & deep truths. Thank you REN for not giving up the fight, highlighting real stories, and sharing your hard won hope.
Total body chill
You took the words out of my mouth!!!! I've been so under enthused about where the real true artists were anymore and then I find you Ren and Sam ty for having the love and maybe madness idk because hey I'm mad too yea but your a beautiful soul and I'm glad you're sharing it with the world🙏💘👩‍🎤
Speechless
Ren is the voice of a generation! He is a true artist.
Newbie 5 videos in and what a roller coaster with full delivery! Genius! I wish everyone was ready to experience you.
Ren Fall in love give us the music break up give us the music hope you have a Happy life but trust your music is everything to us!!!!!

I rarely leave comments but wow! REN your amazing
Hey people in November USA got elections please if you receive a call from any pollster express your discontent in the polls stating your uncommitted vote status and mention the issue is holding you back, we need to remove greed from power!!
Your amazing ren!

Concept

Menarik thumbnail itu
He’s fucking awesome
I ❤ ren so so much
Ren is pure magic. It is just so f###ing amazing
"At 22 he learns that truth is just an obstacle to wealth, if you minipulate the data then the lie will sell itself"  Hardest line of the song.
Masterpiece indeed!
You cant erase the devil from the garden the painting. Unless you burn the painting and use the ashes to paint a new one
Wow
I always come back on this track. so meaningful, and the poetry is very mindful, very demure HAHA
Superb.
This dude smart af
Showed this to a friend, he said ren looks like cillian murphy and now I can't unsee it
Mr beast alternate universe?
Beautiful.
This is absolutely incredible. Also reminds me of my brother… 😭   Beautifully done, written, directed, etc. A masterpiece. Great work as always. 👏🏼
I can't believe how you can perform such music, you are a discovery of contemporary music. I am from Poland, and I feel how politics is leading to the destruction of my country
Dammnn and im thinking the pain in my foot for 2 years right now,(where im getting surgery for in a couple of months, and i have to sit still for 3 months after that again) is some heavy shit. But man you have been through a lot of shit man🙏🏻💪🏻. I have learn with my painfull foot that it is sometimes not bad to feel sad, but you always have to try to fight against!💪🏻💪🏻❤️
Another time for the Algo ❤
Story telling at its fucking finest, thats what i need more of in music.
Sheer truth...this is needed
Thank you! #freesickboi
Damn... Impactful
One for the algorithm. GOOSE BUMPS! Insane.
I love that the moment he grabs the camera, it just COMMANDS your attention. He looks at the camera, but you can tell he's suddenly breaking the 4th wall and looking at YOU.  If you somehow weren't already paying full attention to the video, that's the moment you snap into it.  If you were, that's when he digs his nails into you, and pulls you right over the edge.   It's an absolutely marvelous scene!
damn, who knew that "Thomas Shelby" could spit bars too? 😂 awesome work tho 🙏
here I am listening to this music while at work. don't know why tears fell suddenly
@chriswebby thank you for ren
Never has there been such captivating silence as a Ren music video. 🔇🤔
This is an actual masterpiece 👑💙💙
I'm glad he didn't kill us, I am
There is no Artist out there like REN . He is one of a kind. He is a musical genius ❤
who wanted to show real life, but showed unrealistic version of the rich, because if they ended up like jimmy, then we'd be living better lifes
made by an artist
art
Let it Be, version Ren
Masterpiece! 🤍
As always. Woah. Another powerful voice of the universe.
Wait what how did I just stumble across this 😮
Awesome and relatable
Wow.
Awesome track Ren 👏 Those strings, your voice, the lyrics gave me goosbumps... Thank you! ❤
Pure poetry.
I don't know young fella..im very proud of you, you are an inspiration to many, very talented musician with a fantastic voice👏 ❤
Ren... At last, a man with something to say.
🤍
<(@)>  -  <(@)>!!!
Totally unbelievable music.
Tour in Canada when!?!? 🫶
Truly a incredible indictment of unfettered capitalism and I love you for it.   It's the human race's downfall.   Just look at the state of the UK and world.   Get up, stand up, stand up for your rights....a nice cover with your unique wording over the top?!   ❤
Excellent song about unfettered capitalism and where we're exactly going and many are striving for.   When really all that matters is how nice you've been!   Because Karma's a bum and will ruin your next life, you'll come back as a roach getting sprayed with nasty toxins over a million years, because of what you've done to the planet and the people you've stepped on.   Ain't nothing ever trickling down to folks like us, capitalism I scream no more, but the morons keep voting thinking that they're actually free....
Brilliant.
Remind me of the dude on peaky blinders.  You’re very talented.
I usually don’t get so hype on musicians but I feel like the algorithm brought him to me and I’m a little mesmerized. It’s rare you see artists who are so well rounded and being so many things to the table
What's your solution? Redistribution? That's been tried before. Corruption and greed still abound in socialist "utopias". Free market capitalism is the only system that allows no barriers to entry into the "money game". Shareholder capitalism and special interest groups paired with big government corruption is to blame. Free market capitalism is the closest we have ever gotten to "utopia," before it was hijacked by big government. The freedom of anyone to shape their own life in the way they want whether that be for good or evil. Handing the government more control has never turned out well. Look at where we are today. Big government=Big corruption
You are an amazing actor as well!
Welp... I can only ever watch this once. My anxiety near the end was rather high.
BLASTING OFFFF go On, please go on. Your work is mesmerizing! WE ARE PARASITIC. Let us infect eachother with fucking abominable love!  Love to see you grow. Been watching old and new Vids-mixed. This is just magical! Great piece Ren!
IT IS FUCKING 9 MINUTES! AND IT IS NOT ENOUGH. HOW?????
Again another masterpiece.
so why do I keep trying  ???  knowing it just a money game
Amazing
Ren is so greattt and talented. I really think he would be a great actor 🎉🎉
1:38
Love this video and song. Your talent of storytelling is awesome. Your lyrics are genius, once again.
I’m in tears. I just found out about this artist rn randomly. And oh god it’s just too good 😭
Incredible!
Ren Shelby
I love how the dad says “Man”, in a growl like a wolf to a sheep of a son.
Oh shit, was 45 a play on DT being 45th in the oval office?
One more for the algorithmic gods. You deserve a place in the higher echelons!
The end was dramatically dark.
The storyboarding having an interrelated theme between songs and videos and within this one is really impressive. Your art is so unique and still holds a place in modern music
Th end he presses on the trigger of a money game. Nice
If you manipulate the data the lie will sell itself
Not bad 4 a british...! Na he's good
Don’t think I’ve ever commented on a YouTube video before but the lyrics, production, delivery of everything about this is incredible!
The fact that the boys name is Jimmy and MrBeast is getting exposed for the things he has done is hilarious
Ren, i am almost speechless! my goodness your journey has given you some incredible insights and your delivery, so authentic and unique. Bless you soul, for a bright and beautiful future as you educate many along your pathway, LOVE
Is there a part 1&2 i hope?

Pure greatness
I just came across you on fb reels I think, with your “hi ren” and here I am.. You are so talented ❤ I love the deep raw, truth.
I found you recently on TikTok with hi Ren and was so blown away by it i started looking up all your songs. I love the story telling, messages, and realness of your music and the videos are amazing too. ❤
This men is the definition of a complete artist
Wow, what a great performance about all, I never heard about him
aaron burr flow
Love to work with you, brother  😎🎶✌️♥️
Guess what i heard and where I heard it? Rens Money Game 3 at a Taco Bell restaurant in Perryville Mo. USA on their canned music service only 5hing is they only played the first 13 seconds of it then switched songs, they made me continue by playing it on my own phone louder than their sound system. An employee asked me who it was, I'm thinking I may have created a new Ren fan.
Mother of the f this is amazing and ps your can guy is amazing
True art

When the song starts out with "taking his first steps and running quickly, and his first words were mine mine gimme" and then later in life it turned into "he cursed the words mine mine gimme, at 41 he wasn't walking, 42 not walking quickly". That turn of events.. WOW
epic
No fluff, straight facts
Ren , your artistry , honesty and self awareness is incredible .
This is a brilliant short film based on human exploitation ! It's worth spreading all over the world ! 🙏
Me recuerda a Canserbero
Commenting to boost the algorithm. This needs to be heard AND seen by everyone. ❤
You and Samuel are incredible! I cant stop watching your stuff my dude, a lot of love from Paraguay!

Impressive- spent the last 24h on a deep REN dive
Talk about masterful storytelling. I visualized every minute, every second of the words
I stumbled onto your music from a Reaction 30sec short from Hi Ren.   What you do is so amazing on so many levels, so deliberate  yet so unhinged.  It has just gone 48 hours since I discovered your music and I still can’t fully catch my breath.  The most sincere thank you for everything you have put out into the world and are continuing to do.
So impressive. I keep telling all my creative friends to stop working like they do and move to a patronage-based system to stop worthless greedy middle-men to profit from other people's work and passion. Now I have something else to show them so they see you CAN make the most amazing things outside of the "regular channels" Also... fucking killer lyrics and pace, man. Incredible stuff.
Oh my freaking godfathers!!  This deserves an encore Ren!  You have polished this  colloquial  of the Money game songs from their conception to this version beautifully... and its a freakin winner, through and through. I can envision you being around for a good long time yet Ren.. youre a master in the making. This stated by a 66yo woman who l❤ves your rhyme, verse, music and creativity.. so yep youre up there in my books. 😆😁 Thaaank Youu for keeping the dream alive for me. Thats how gooood music affects me. 🥰🎉
Keep preaching. There's hope for this world yet.
This is Powerful

"This world don't give a damn about you so take all that you can."... The hollow decades of life Jimmy lived is only possible if Jimmy's dad is right, because otherwise someone caring would step in at some point in the story, to save Jimmy from his fate, don't you think? Why do you only cry about his story when he kills himself, when the actual sad part is the decades of suffering he had to endure in his hateful reality? Could it be because you fear death? So it only momentarily seems like you guys are capable of empathy and care, when a literal survival instinct kicks in in you? I bet you thought Jimmy is evil or at least dumb, because he only cares about money. But assuming his dad is actually right and everything else in this world is just a soulless facade, what else is there to even go for? How exactly is it evil or dumb then? It's only sad, and it's true. From the very beginning, it's literally the story. Noone gave a fuck about Jimmy. Jimmy's dad was right! It's a story of a lot of people. We get perceived by the world as evil, but the world is the one evil to us. When the entire world is constantly hostile, you can either lose or fight it with hostility. There is no therapy to make someone like Jimmy help himself, there is no third option he could pick. Jimmy chose the latter and then he realized there is no point and changed his mind to the former.
got no words for this... just.... wow!
I have to say this one was really good, i like to see more like this in the future. Stay true, stay real 👍
wow...never heard the lirycs that good and strong://
I feel like he explained the whole mfing MFing system
ren is a fucking genius. this is so well put together it's ridiculous. im talking money game 1-3 not just this one. nothing but truth and its fucking eye opening.
Classy tasteful
Wow 100 masterpiece
Stress can age plus we don’t reincarnate infants
This is brilliant
So I learned and I showed him secretive humiliation with dignity remorse and knowing my life will never be the same.  Sibling rivalry plus watching children suffer!!! Big one
Mate this is ansolute brilliance.... i hope the world sees this and change the sysyem.... thankyou.. ❤
Wow, just wow
Comment
Are you f*cking for real????? Ren, are you proud yet? Just a phenommmmenal piece, all day, every day forever. Classic.
Holy hell this hits hard.
wow cant believe i found it only now
Whoah man this is next level genius
This man should be on peaky blinders 😱🙈😱😂😂
I guess he’s supporting labour then yes ren 👏🏻👏🏻👌🏻
Wow, just wow! Ren is an absolute genius, super-talented, I could watch this a million times over and still, my jaw drops open every time!
Pure genius
This hits so much harder than the last one because of the personal element, tbh.  Also, love the symbolism btw.
He reminds me of Arthur from peaky blinders
I've never in my 34 years heard something like this... It's so amazing, they actually should show this in highschool...
This intro has James Bond songtrack vibes.
This i beautiful
The bard of our time. Love ya mate!
bruh someone give the DoP a raise
One word. MASTERPIECE 🔥🔥
Wow talented man
This is on another level. Kudos 👏👏👏
wow wow wow..i just realize now this video is 9 minutes long. felt like 1. incredible.
The truth
I can't get over how good every video is like as always the music is incredible but the videos they put out should be put in a fine art museum like fuck a painting Id wanna see this
🫶
Omg you made my eyes cry out I absolutely love your art
10 months gone and just get a chance to hear that 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
Let's show the love for each other and never give up on each other or are would or I kids much love 😘
Real shit!
Unbelievable talent
No words!! Just discovering your mind blowing truth talent. Thank you! Leaving a comment for the Algorithm as well ♥️💐💐💐
Absolute genius ren can sing a song, write a rap, show a movie. Tell a story, draw a painting, all while showing extremely raw emotion or none at all: the definition of art is this, and hi ren, your work is pure art and it has helped many many people. God bless you my friend, across the pond <3
This is fantastic!
Blown away again , so much talent and bravery. Thank you so much to bring it to the world.
Amazing
Exquisite! How is this guy and his music still not everywhere?!
People need to realize that their body, their brain, is a chemical factory.  We literally can manufacture out own happiness or sadness. Thought alone can produce the chemical compounds we desire.  Learn not to need external stimulus.  Learn to produce what makes oneself happy by seeing the reaction when we are the external stimulus others need.  This video tells a truth; a truth learned late.  Those in the know need to endure, and survive, to teach; save the next generation.
he plays piano????  Grammy now...how come this dude is not #1 everywhere...@eminem...listen to this ace...
Dude you are amazing!! And your words are showing the history of how things do?!? Love it!! Keep it up and THANK YOU ❤❤
Μπράβο φίλε
Just came across this. Thank you  thank you for this. How have I not found you all these years?    One question though. Why did the bullet not hit in the end? Russian Roulette? Hope? Or he must face his fate?
@ren and @Chinchilla your voices  compliment each other so well love your work together and thankyou for singing for those who find it hard the truth of some people real lives sometimes others have to deal with more than just a broken heart, and you sing like your singing my life story in some song so thankyou for both your talent, stay blessed  🙏
Mr beast origin story?
Truthful performance!  Simply, magnificent!
That s a pure masterpiece
Wow.
Pure transcendental poetry Ren. ❤
I’m obsessed!!!
Love this Tomy Shelby accent 🔥
Music with actual meaning. Not some catchy bullshit that says absolutely nothing about the author. I just can't get enough. I found you while scrolling through YouTube, while sitting at work. I love the music, I love the message, I can't get enough....Keep it up Ren!
masterpiece
Truth.
Well said brother
I have come to the conclusion that in all of the music I listen to, Ren is a genius. His videographer is equally amazing. The depth of his lyrics and the subject matter are incredibly profound. And this is without even mentioning his style of rapping, his rhythm, his timing and absence.
Whatever dude, im entertained so im using it as entertainment
are you gay??
10 months ago? Feels like yesterday. Goosebumps every time!❤
How come I’m Just getting to see this 😮
What a story teller, amazing 👏
I‘m 36 years old and at 6:00 you got me. Goose pimpals and tears in my eyes. Brilliant Masterpiece of Video, Music and Story.  Thanks a lot!
Ur the music we’ve been waiting for spread the message my guy
Wow, this gave me the shivers. What a piece of work!!
Fuckin genius. Incorporating hi ren and the neuse reference dude evwrything is genius.
And our fate can be the same without this story to the wise ....hits
This guys talent is just incomprehensible! Privileged to be an OG listener ❤
Man brother your the Shakespeare of the new! Such talent and dedication to real life experiences. I’m a 64 yr old young lady whom relates to your talent! Love your art,talent *****
One non-music related detail that I need to point out, simce even Holywood usually mess it up … the 1911 at the end is cocked, so ready to fire, not like usual with hammer down, hence useless …  And Ren, your music is not something that I usualy listen to, however your sends shivers down my back … keep it goimg and stay strong!
This is Art
every single song is just brilliant! This guy is major talented !
Hope to see more of your creations!
Cant get enough of this. same for "hi Ren"
The story, the delivery, the visuals, the palpable raw emotion? This is a timeless masterpiece
Beautiful, always enjoy your artistry.
He is incredibly talented.i am bipolar and live with chronic pain and this sang to my soul.Thank you for sharing
Still need a bass player and a back up howler
Really really like Ren touch of 16th century,  malsteam, scorpions  Mike skinner and others  his genius to put it all together xx
damm, i wanna enjoy the lyrics and the rap, but the things you say force you to stop and think constantly, very great video
Imagine landing a role in a music video, then you have to put a bag on your head 😂 Cool video and song still 😊
I have not words 😢...... It's like i was watching a whole movie 🎥.
Truly brilliant
My new fav artist I've decided.
Do a song with Tina Sektic.
So sad when this masterpiece has only 6.6 M views … you deserve way more than that.
Incredible
Still excellent.
Holy holy holy. Ren your brilliant
This guy sounds like chris webby 😂 🔥
I haven't watched a music video / visuals in years......but this was TOTALLY worth it 🙌
Like Madcat im on the wrong side of 60 and grew up with Dylan ,Springsteen and co however Ren is not another artist he is Art
This... This is what genius is made of!
Brilliant, everytime .watched it many times since ,🙏✌️
Just wow
Congratulations Ren.Greetings from Hungary
You are my favorite truth teller.
Nah someone can't cook like this it's not natural 😂😅
Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy 1 years old and his first words were "Mine, mine, gimme!" 2 years old he was walking, 3 years old walking quickly 4 years old he was running 'round the pavements of the city 5 years old and his daddy told him "Listen here, son You gotta learn to be a man, a man he works for what he wants" 6 years old and he's reading, writing, top of the bunch And when he's 7, his progression made him student number 1 8 years old and he's praised for unusual grades 9, his parents pay for privatе school to nurture the flame 10, 11, 12, 13, hе ascends and ascends His daddy tells him "Son, money is the means to all ends" 14, solving complex mathematic equations 15, IQ 150, still elevating 16, he develops complex software code That detects weaknesses in cyber security protocols 17, and he sells vision keeping a share Not yet an adult, but he's practically a millionaire 18, and his daddy tells him "Now you're a man This world don't give a damn about you, so take all that you can" 19, he turns a profit stocks and shares invest in product 20, double-down deposits, 21, his income rockets 22, he learns that truth is just an obstacle to wealth If you manipulate the data, then a lie will sell itself 23, a life of luxury crystal and cocaine 24, he makes the Forbes list, they're applauding his name 25, and his daddy tells him, "listen here son While you are sitting in your palace, that don't mean that you won" 26, a business shift he switches business to arms 27, dealing nuclear and shells in Iran 28, inside the Senate money bought him a seat 29, a role of the council in the president, sweet Now he's 30 and his daddy says "You're losing the race You're just a servant to the king, not even in second place" 31, a big maneuver for his daddy's approval Moving imports over borders from the exports out of Cuba 32, moving grams, growing kilos to tonnes He's 33, filling warehouses with powder and guns 34, turf war with nobody to stop it Blind eye from the po-po inside of his pocket 35 and he gets a call, "I'm sorry son It's your father, had a heart attack, I'm sorry, he's gone" 36, getting pissed up, abusing his product 37, eyes glazed, disposition demonic 38 with a prostitute, a moment of passion Heating up a silver spoon and then chasing the dragon 39, getting reckless and hungry for power Daddy's words still driving him to kill and devour He makes a move against the cartel, but the strategie's flawed They retaliate and leave him in a hospital ward A bullet buried in the vertebra and one in the leg The doctor sighs and says "I don't think you'll be walking again", fuck  [Verse 2] Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy He was 40, and he cursed the words "Mine, mine, gimme" 41, he wasn't walking, 42, not walking quickly 43, never running 'round the pavement of his city 44 inside his palace with a mountain of gold But the riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves Weighing heavy on his conscience is the value of gold A Lamborghini for a life, trading money for souls Jimmy followed the code inside the land of the free Put your hand inside the cookie jar, take more than you need And his is example is exaggerated versions of me And it's a version of him, and it's a version of she And it's a version of you, there's no escaping the blame The way we live is parasitic, fuck the money and fame! Cut the music!  [Verse 3] This ain't entertainment, this is real life The way we live is lunacy, community, it declines Hyperpolerised, always fighting, then we divide Truth is less important than the money that we designed? Money's an invention, politics from our invention They all come from peoples ideas, did I mention? Borders? Our invention, law and order, fuel the tension That leads to people killing each other. My solution? Everything is subject to change We can build utopias if individuals are taught to use their brains But if we teach kids in school to always be sheep And put ourselves before the herd if there's more money for me Then there's no future I see, where the humans survive We're parasites inside a Petri dish with cannibal minds Mold grows upon a surface, it consumes till it dies And our fate could be the same, so here's a story for the wise  [Outro] 45, Jimmy comes home out of the rain Soaking wet upon a wheelchair, drinking again He is everything he wants, he has fortune and fame He's a fortunate fool with an unfortunate fate With a 45 caliber aimed at his brain 45 - a fitting number, 'cause his age is the same Hears the words of his father; "Such a damn shame" Then he presses on the trigger of a money game
wow
anyone else thinks this should be made into a movie where you'd see the diffrent age's just like he tells in the song
What  just i did witness?! Holy shit! The word masterpiece doesnt do the money game trilogy justice!
Damn didn’t know MrBeast was dealing arms 😢
The best music video i have possibly ever seen and the song to go with it, masterpiece from start to finish
You're a beautiful person, please continue being you❤
🥰🥰🥰🙂💋♥️
I am speechless
Everytime someone likes this I wanna be reminded of this masterpiece
❤❤
Damn crazy
This is a beautiful and powerful work of art!
You could do a one man show on broadway. You are so lyrical and theatrical ❤❤❤
I love u ur so good
algorhythmic
Eminem wished he was this good!!!!
You miss one big point in the whole movement you are trying to inflame... Money, a.k.a currency, exists in ALL SYSTEMS.  When fiat currency no longer exists, trade will remain.  Money will simply evolve to whatever commodities are available.  When the party controls the food supply, food becomes the new gold.  The money game continues, you cannot escape it for you are focused on the wrong thing.  Money is not the enemy.  Greed is the enemy, Money is the fuel - and anything can be money.
Masterpiece
Here because of Prof:Pain Salesmen
No se que dice el chico pero me suena a extrema derecha y capitalismo
Waouw.
absolute masterpiece
Genius
Your musical talents are amazing
Just recently found you and I am in awe. I haven't put on headphones and just relaxed to music in a long time. Yet, here I am, headphones on for an hour, down the rabbit hole of your mind and I am loving every second. Great work! Even your covers are excellent!
He does  these live do not only is he singing , rapping , acting , recording etc

Pure masterpiece!
Dear Youtube,  Im so disappointing on you for hiding me  gems like this one.
This get me more than any movie or a series ever did. "Jimmy followed the code in the land of the free" Bro I'm hooked.
As a counselor—- I’m literally in, Awe. 🫢 This is possibly the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen, heard, or experienced.  REN, you are a special soul. Thank you for sharing your gift.
Your the goat
real and (sadly) accurate
Tu es un génie, un talent de dingue,artiste complet, des frissons,des larmes,sourire tout y passe ,un pure talent merci d exister et de nous faire partager ce talent monstrueux
I discovered Ren not long ago and each one of his songs just wow me, no word for it.
Wow

Ren your words are powerful
Leaving a comment for the algorithm

Ren is a genius. Greetings from Hungary
Ren for president 2024 - we need someone with this ideology
Thomas Shelby is that you?
man predicted mrbeast (jimmy)
I’ve only just discovered Ren. A whole new world of something phenomenal. I so hoped the ending would be different but I get it…
bro predicted jimmy
Modern Shakespeare!!!!!!!
Looking like Tommy Shelby 🎉

This one’s unreal❤great work!
I love ren
Inceadble!!! ❤❤
I caught wind of Ren through the 'luigi tells luigi about business' meme and im so glad i did. His songs are amazing and this cinematography is just perfect.
Butterflies and Hurricanes.
love this guy passion is sprinkled through out his music its clear he loves this job and we love him for it
I'm in awe of his talent
Ahh yes rich white people problems 😂
I have watched this so many times and every time it makes me say wow
The camera work was phenomenal, it still felt raw but also expertly controlled.  I don’t need to comment on the music. The music is why I’m here, it speaks for itself.  Also wanna show some appreciation to the timing of those in the background. Simply amazing work all the way around!
This guy is a genius, he should have a west end show.  I just can’t get enough of him  ❤
Y he look like young thomas shelby and why does that make sense
This is what happens when Shakespeare and Eminem have a kid lol
An actual masterpiece
Everytime I watch this I’m left in awe it’s such a masterclass in storytelling 🤌🏻
So glad I found your art
❤ thank for this one, a daughter of a father just like this.
WOW!
For the algorithm
You know how we all were shocked and transfixed by Squid Game? This is like that, but in six minutes. What incredible storytelling!
Artist
Everytime I listen to a song by Ren I havent heard, I find a new favorite song. 🥰
a masterpiece everytime i listen to this i get goosebumps
ART
Just discovered you today... You are my new obsession
So relatable!
😢 As we get closer to the 2024 election here in the US, I feel everyone should hear & UNDERSTAND these lyrics. I am crying and that ending scared the he!! out of me! Ren, you are so very talented and out of your struggles and pain, comes this brilliance! Thank you! Thank you for sharing this with the world! Maybe, just maybe, it will help people to wake up to what is around them. We need them to wake up!
As someone who just found out about his music and has been listening deeply to all of his songs for the last 6 hours, I have to say I find so much comfort in Ren’s music. I find so much meaning in his music videos, his lyricism is unlike anything I’ve ever heard before, and I find such deep understanding in his music. I’m grateful to be able to listen to his music, and his story because I can relate to him. Ren’s music is eye opening
he could play the brother of cilian murphy
Literally Mr Beast right now.
The power of his lyrics alone are enough to inspire but the perfect performance hits so hard i cant find the words to express how much I appreciate rens music thankyou ren and everyone else involved in this life changing art.
WOOOAAAAH
I love this version
What a guileless way to depict the characters cupidity… 🤯
insane
Fantastic. He’s a true artist
BIG UP REN 💙💪🏽 killing the game ! #1 too ? CRUSHING IT 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Modern day Shakespeare!
Serious talent
Absolutely a stunning masterpiece
Whites are rappin, blacks are singing now...
Sharing this in my dreams with another realm ❤️
Next level. Jim Nasium. Top secret.
Full on agree with the modern bard comments - actually love it
I honestly believe u are a absolute Genius Ren
What genre would u even consider this greatness?
I’m still trying to figure out what just happened to me.
This is music and art, this is truth and reality. Other famous "artists" talk about superficial stuff with songs that become trending for some months until a new one gets their place. But this is music cannot be replace or become a trend. This is the music that lasts forever because there is a soul left in it. 90% of the songs nowadays are soulless, superficial music that gets forgotten unlike this masterpiece of art that is eternal. You are amazing Ren. Just discovered you from tiktok and i was left speechless from both of your top songs. Just amazing.
This is brilliant so talented Ren
Every song, every lyric i hear from Ren brings raw emotion. I lost my nephew, my child 2 years ago on Saturday, to drugs, but i found Ren. He makes me feel again. What an incredible human he is. Love you Ren, please keep making me feel human again.
Love this! Keep it up Ren
This was amazing on the full video! It appears I'm not able to leave a comment on the actual link. You are 100% on this game we call money! Thank you hopefully it will wake those whom believe the lies.
Tommy Shelby x Hamilton 🙌🏼
Lost my edging streak to this😭😭😭
This man took me through a journey on storytelling never a dull moment!! Keep it up Ren!
FINALLY something original , REN you are new level, come to Toronto 🙌🙌
❤❤ trying to bring this back
YESSSSS!

Damn!!!😮😮😮
Вот это настоящее искусство!....
W song
Wow.
Another level, another connection, another story. Thank you SO MUCH REN.
JUST WOW
AMAZING THAT IS AWESOME
Wow
❤ ❤ ❤
Not sure if I should listen to Ren or lobby to put him in a museum as the world’s only example of living, breathing art. Imagine looking at than Van Gogh’s Pietà and then stepping to the left and seeing, hearing Ren.
This is some of the truest and most prevalent tune to me I have ever herd. Thanks Ren please please keep them coming......thank you taz.
Would you play this at a party ?
Difficult to put in words what a masterpiece this is
The way Ren tells a story with the music and the visuals are absolutely brilliant
Unreal❤

Весь мир сделал..... Умница
Ε ρε μαλακα μην φτιάχνεις τόσο καλά τραγούδια γαμω το στανιό μου γμω έχω πει σε όλους τους τυχαίους από όλο τον κόσμο τον ψυχισμό  μου μετά από αυτό το τραγούδι γιατί είναι τοσο γαμημενα καλό και είναι κάτι που έχω να νιώσω εδώ και που καιρό πλάκα βασικά πρόσφατα μάθαινα νέα τραγούδια αλλά αυτό γαμαει υπερβολικά πολύ τύπου σκατα το έχω ακούσει 15 φορές ολόκληρο μέσα σε 2 μέρες και την 1η φορά είχα μείνει με ανοιχτό το στόμα. Συμπληρώνω ότι το ινσρουμενταλ το άκουσα άλλες 10 φορες
This man is a theatrical GENIUS. Truly, Ren could write thriving broadway musicals. Incredible. First listen today.
I love for you to produce or write.Or make a song with marlon craft
Me and my brother listen to this all the time together
There are no good governments. Anyone who thinks they have authority over you is your enemy. Act accordingly.
Wow. I wasn't ready for how deep this is.
Holey fuck
She sells sea shells.
This saga has some ledger joker vibes. The world is insane, or is it just me?
And the sponsor of this video is the Rich People's Club. And they want you to think that money brings bad luck.  Hahahahaha 😄😅😆
I still tear up while listening and watching.  Get's me everytime. ❤
i just went to the Kujobeats song to downvote because of his sickboy crap, i suggest who ever reads this to do the same
Eu quero mais
rad
He reminds me of Thomas Shelby
Finally something new and fresh in music.
i struggle to express my impression, i hope this shout from saudi means something to you,  your art is captivating and more importantly healing 👌🏻
Yaya!
Wen a Peaky Blinder becomes an artist...
Amazing! Great music, lyrics, storytelling and cinematography!  Absolutely astounding!
Did Cillian Murphy start rapping too?
There are no words, absolutely amazing!!!!!
When are we going to see a collaboration between Tom or Dax?
B A N G E R
Just watched the documentary (short version) and saw the hand off of the mag. It's crazy bc I wondered in light of the Baldwin case how they did it.
Wordsmith at his finest, well done ren 👌
Ren.  Thank you for your Perspective.. God damned the world needs it.  Fucking Brilliant buddy.
Things song requires meticulous breaths in to be able to flow along oof.
Would like to meet and jam ❤
What art school did this guy go to. Maybe if I send my kids there too they will also be artists?
Ren eh?❤,..rockn at 90s gear,if we had him in 90s? Man,they wouldnt a got it,..now just granda 😂,.away for a bowlcut now😊 ❤,

You are such an artist and brilliant in the way you paint your stories ❤
As an American I really needed to listen to this today
Well, God. I'm on a Ren binge here. If you stopped now, you will have already left a legacy more substantial and profound than most people could. I just hope you will be okay when you reach stratospheric levels, because like it or not, it is going to happen. Best of luck.
Hey Brah this just money game of 00.003%, you ΣF MA$O CHI$T, your G.O.D. is at Dangerous State of Mind¿!※

As a first timer listening to Ren i must say hes beyond great, truely a masterpiece. For you who don't know about Tom MacDonald i suggest you look him up. Imagine a collab with ren and him, holy fack we'd have the deep state security sounding alarms...
❤
I'm in need of your prayers and support. Please keep me in your thoughts as I navigate my health journey.
He's like a male Kate Bush  👌
I do wonder what would happen if Jimmy's father hadn't died in this story, and would he have kept climbing and climbing but it never being enough to satisfy his dad?
you are the best... the words is the best arms.
I listen to the song all the time, but again, the video just adds a whole layer to it. this is insane quality
Thomas Shelby
Will there be an acoustic because that would be insane
This guy should be in a Broadway show in NYC.
Never have I heard something so theatrical and amazing Very cool :)
Whether we like it or not, pretty sure he's living a posthumous existence like Keats.  Might just be a genius.
Absolutely a masterpiece. Great storytelling
A song that tells a story better than most movies these days. Absolutely a masterpiece.
Love how you take your lyrics to a place of wisdom and place of truth 🥰🥰
I always get goose bumps at 5:54
lyrics with a message. powerful.
начало было впечетляюще но потом понос
I'm sure that Edvard Grieg would approve this song. What a great piece of music.
What a genius poet one of the best guys I've ever found. I know he's not Eminem but he will probably be the next big thing in this world. Just stay safe and healthy mate.
the art in this song is insane bro, the camera movements, the acting and just the over all song is chilling. this is the best song i ever heard
Lyrics:   Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy One years old and his first words were mine, mine gimme Two years old, he was walking, three years old, walking quickly Four years old, he was running around the pavements of his city Five years old, and his daddy told him, listen here son, you've got to learn to be a man A man he works for what he wants Six years old, and he's reading, writing, top of the bunch And when he's seven, his progression made him student number one Eight years old and he's praised for unusual grades Nine, his parents pay for private school to nurture the flame 10, 11, 12, 13, he ascends and ascends, his daddy tells him, son, money is the means to all ends 14 solving complex mathematic equations, at 15, IQ 150, still elevating 16 he develops complex software code that detects weaknesses in cyber security protocol 17, and he sells his vision, keeping the share, not yet an adult But he's practically a millionaire 18, and his daddy tells him now you're a man the world don't give a damn about you So take all that you can 19, he turns a profit, stocks and shares, invest in product 20, double down deposits 21, his income rockets 22, he learns that truth is just an obstacle to wealth If you manipulate the data, then the lie will sell itself 23, a life of luxury Crystal and cocaine 24, he makes the Forbes list, they're applauding his name 25, and his daddy told him, listen here, son, while you're sitting in the palace That don't mean that you won 26, his business shifts, he switches business to arms He's 27, dealing nuclear shells in Iran 28, inside the Senate, money bought him a seat He's 29, role of counsel in the president suite And now he's 30, his daddy says, you're losing the race You're just a servant to the king, not even in second place 31, a big maneuver for his daddy's approval Moving imports over borders from the exports out of Cuba 32, moving grams, growing kilo to tons He's 33, filling warehouses with powder and guns 34, turf war with nobody to stop it, blind eye from the Po po inside of his pocket 35, he gets a call, I'm sorry, son, but it's your father, had a heart attack I'm sorry, he's gone, 36, getting pissed off abusing this product 37, eyes glazed, disposition demonic 38, with a prostitute, a moment of passion Heating up the silver spoon and then chasing the dragon 39, getting reckless and hungry for power Daddy's words still driving him to kill him and devour He makes a move against the cartel, but the strategy's flawed They retaliate and leave him in the hospital ward A bullet buried in his vertebra, and one in his leg The doctor sighs and says, I don't think you'll be walking again, fuck Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy He was 40 and he cursed the words mine, mine gimme 41, he wasn't walking, 42, not walking quickly, 43 Never running round the pavements of his city 44 inside a palace with a mountain of gold But those riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves Weighing heavy on his conscience is the value of gold, Lamborghini for a life Trading money for souls, Jimmy followed the code inside the land of the free Put your hand inside the cookie jar, take more than you need And his example is exaggerated versions of me, and it's a version of him And it's a version of she, and it's a version of you There's no escaping the blame, the way we live, it's parasitic Fuck the money and fame, cut the music This isn't entertainment, this is real life, the way we live is lunacy, community it declines We're hyperpolarized, we're always fighting and we divide Truth is less important than the money that we designed? Money's an invention, politics from our invention, they all come from people's ideas Did I mention, border's an invention Law and order fuels the tension that leads to people killing each other My solution? Everything is subject to change We could build utopias if individuals were taught to use their brains But if we teach kids in schools to always be sheep and put themselves before the herd If there's more money for meat Then there's no future I see where the humans survive We're parasites inside the Petri dish, with cannibal mines Mold will grow upon the surface, then consumes 'til it dies And our fate could be the same without this story to the wise 45, Jimmy comes home out of the rain, soaking wet upon a wheelchair Drinking again, he has everything he wants, he has fortune and fame Such a fortunate fool with an unfortunate fate with a 45 caliber aimed at his brain 45, a fitting number because his age is the same Here's the words of his father, it's such a damn shame Then he presses on the trigger of a money game
Holy shit.  One of the most mesmerizing videos ever.  Team RENSam, you should most certainly write your own musical.  Here in the US we have Hamilton (incredible musical written by one man) which is phenomenal and I think you two can achieve the same. Bravo 👏
This is just amazing. Like WOW!
Guy is a genius 🫢🔥
Welcome to World War THREE folks… Clearly somebody rang the bell.  Was it you?  Are you in the game and you don’t know it, or did YOU already
This is pure art ❤
Also I think you would like Dobacaracol
Ren, you’d enjoy 8 secondes from the band Les Cowboys fringants if you can understand French… or you could just translate the song ;)
Algorithms should work for your sake.
Your voice is so soothing... I can't
Awesome bro When you coming to the states   Please cover beastie boys   Your choice  lol Love your stuff   Come get some southern backwoods  Chicken picking
Possible Money Game Pt. 4???
So glad I found your music! Every word spoken captivates me. True poet
Looking Forward to Asylum🎉🎉🎉
This Still the Best🎉Congrats Bois!!# Hope🩵✌️💃💯😎🎤🎼🎶
Oficially you are my favorite artist.
Holy shit, this is nothing short of a fucking master piece, it is truly incredible. I heard the first song, and got straight hooked. It is truly unfair that someone as great as you isn't more well known, keep doing your thing Ren and you'll make a lasting impression on both music and people!!!
Just amazing! ❤
Absolutely Amazing absolute masterpiece.
wadafak this is insane
Never knew Tommy Shelby was this good at singing!
Beautiful said son
7:17 "it leaves the people killing eachother, my solution-" ren: "starts takeing jacket off* my brain: prostitution?
You can't say one is better than the next...each are absolutely stunning.  Instead of the delusional crap people are listening to, memorize these lyrics embed it into their brains. We are the cause of all of this shit and we can stop it. We are the problem and the solution.
Thank you for putting words to what is on so many of our hearts. I saw a comment that said “art should comfort the disturbed and disturb the comfortable” and while the content is chilling in its accuracy, I’ve never felt more seen in an artists work.   Thank you, Ren.
For the algorithm…again 🔥🔥🔥👏👏👏❤️
Damn this song is so fucking good, message should be heeded by everyone and life might be a bit better
I love an artist that speaks the truth
Omg…..
Excuse me? Is there anything this man cannot do? I love you ren
I think that i'm in love with your Talent.
I am subscribed already, but been watching all you're videos through reactions.  Figure I'd start watching your videos on you page and giving you the views and likes you deserve!  Good job on all your songs!  Chin up and get well.
Spot on bro, keep it up!
Dystopian James Bond
I fucking loved Part 2 already so I was surprised to see this new one when scrolling trough YT. Man what a gut wrenching story hell fucking yeah!  I wonder now if all 3 parts so far can be strung together into a single whole...
In this video, at points, he slightly looks like cillian Murphy
didn't felt like a 9mins video at all!!🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯❤
At 50 years old I'm simply blown away! Ren is a modern day Elton John, mixed with Freddy Mercury, blended with Jimi Hendrix, and finished with Eminem. Phenomenal!
First time listening to this. Just brilliant.
Ren as the Doctor that stole the Taurus😅
Brazil 🎉❤ love song. Perfect
I'm on the verge of Jimmy's resolution. I know life can be better, but it doesn't seem like it'll get there in my lifetime. Maybe if I had the courage to actually use my index finger I'd be able to rid myself of the pain and misery. Too bad I'm a coward.
You are the new breed.  Keep it up.  The world is changing and your insurance will move us forward.
This is absolutely brilliant.....He's a genius.....Every time world music seems to get flat and repetitive....nature throws up an innovator, someone who manages to break the mould and be totally original.....It's great to watch and the lyrics are so complex yet meaningful
BRILLIANT!! PURE GENIUS!! You are killer with your story telling skills. I’m glad to have come across your channel today.
You just kill me😬😁🙏🤗🙏👍👍
Found it. Respect it. 👊🏼
Shit, went to like all of the positive comments, I'd be here all week, this man is an absolute fucking genius 💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️💯
Bro really looked like Thomas Shelby during the unmasking
god I can never get enough of this
❣
Preaching about money and fame while gaining money and fame. Love it.
Absolutely fuckin beautiful! This is what I see .. good job getting this out there Ren .. thanks brother 🙏✨
damn amazing!!!
My Mom always taught me love … and as a kid I thought my Dad was a hard ass … hind sight it was probably a good balance  Work hard … don’t judge people … and have confidence to stand up for yourself and and others  I was no Angel when I was young But I knew what was right or wrong because of them  Thx again Ren
Business Economics in a nursery rhyme
Bo Burnham and Ren have a lot in common, great intelligence, insights beyond their years, great lyricist, able to structure visuals along with multi-talented instruments compositions and themes. But also both cursed with the struggles of mental health, and the weight of their own talents to do something meaningful.   Is genius cursed if you have empathy?  I think so.  Because the world is shit and you see every part of it, the world is shit and you know every inch of it. All the bullshit and lies that people give you in spite of it, you see through the crap that they spew all inside of it. Fuck the rich, fuck the poor they all want the same fucking war. To be the beneficiary of others brains, pains, and gains without ever having to hold the reins. Always with their hands in the jar, taking more than they need hoping to be a goddamn star.  I hate it here.
Strange times we're living in World can put fear in ya Hierarchy parties, they make us feel inferior Greed runs through the parliament interior Devils walk among us, they fit the criteria Eerie theories strike fear in weary minded men When we're clearly living in dictatorships Nearly blinded by illusions to choose But who's fooling who? A ball chained to your shoes I'm pained, it's a crying shame The pursuit of our own wealth lights a flame That makes greed a game that lets the whole world burn As the world turns, the whole world burns Money was invented for trade But now those bits of paper twist hearts, make slaves Turns a saint into a sinner, a child into a killer His finger on the trigger of a money game Oh, rain, rain, rain, rain A storm, it comes our way And those who rise through distorted lies Poison in the veins But we like to point the blame, blame, blame, blame It's easier to blame But point the mirror at ourselves We're all part of this old money game This old money game This old Dear Mr. President, it's evident that everyone's a resident Of fear when they support the ideas that keep us separate When they make us believe that everybody Is coming to terrorise you in the streets They say proudly through gritted teeth "It's my right to hate, that's freedom of speech!" When did freedom become a reason to hate? A way to justify a racial slur or insult we make There's an irony in freedom, because us in the west We have pillaged and plundered and murdered like savages Colonised all of the rest, that's called hypocrisy Preach a certain value that you'd never keep yourselves If your country was in flames, you'd emigrate yourselves in a second Still, you spit your venom, demonising immigrants When really, you're an immigrant 'Cause all of us are immigrants Or descended from immigrants The irony is imminent, I'll shed the light on immigrants America was colonised by Britain Britain, it was colonised by Rome Also, colonised by the Saxons They were German, by the way You know how people throw shade upon the Germans 'Cause of history's pain And yet we make the same mistakes all again Demonise a whole people, Jewish or Muslim the same and the same Old situations play on repeat The same old TV shows repeat Yeah, we worship the bleak Our opinions aren't our own and we follow like sheep There's no left, there's no right In the middle we sleep Rain, rain, rain, rain A storm, it comes our way And those who rise through distorted lies Poison in the veins But we like to point the blame, blame, blame, blame It's easier to blame But point the mirror at ourselves We're all part of this old money game This old money game This old money game
this. THIS
@renmakesmusic if you haven't already, you should check out George Carlin. He is an American comedian/philosopher. His thoughts and beliefs come out as very funny, yet sad truths about the way things are. I have a feeling you'll love him. 😊
Dude, im absolutely amazed by your skills. keep on going! High art value
Ai...doesn't work for money.
Corny
Amazing... I got sent something from Ren today, everything i have watched has been genius. How have i never heard of this guy..
Genius
Wth the algorithm showed me a awesome song and a cinematography for the first time in 2 months
Let me pull this rope from around my neck and lift this veil from my eyes. Love your music. Keep slaying, my man. I'll be here listening. ❤
As a renn, i approve of your message buried within. If we are truly children of god, we must pass his last test. given to adam and eve when they were cast out. that task? Learn to create like he does and guard the eden for those to come. It's should be humanities united goal to grow in a way that is symbiotic with earth and learn to spread life to other planets. Only that road, leads to a place where all our future children will not suffer hunger or sickness and have space to roam.
I can't tell how much I love Ren's music and how grateful I am that I searched Bob Marley's "I shot the sheriff" song because that one has brought me to Ren.
I've shown this video to multiple friends, trying to do my part to boost your reach, Ren. Your music is beautiful, great and inspirational. Commenting to boost activity for the algorithm. Wishing the best for you, Ren. You're great.
ABSOLUTELY FUCKING BRILLIANT. We love you Ren 💙💙💙💪💥
this is awesome
Why is this not on stage!
outstanding creative, well done to you and the team who created this! amazing work
The best thing I have seen this week. Truly amazing artist!
Fuckin live these stories ❤️
May humanity overcome the ego and rise into higher concioussnes, this is gold 💚
Like this comment if your first song was a girl named Jenny way back :)
I can't get over how many takes it must have taken for him to fall into that wheelchair without missing.   Also, I love the detail of the pan to the gun so he can switch the mag to an empty one. You can see in the blur that the mag he puts in has grey at the top, meaning empty, no bullets or blanks. Safest option for the ending.
You mean a lot to me...
wow dude
Wow!
dont become too dangerous or they will kill u.
For my contempry dance solo I am doing it to this song
Ren will you save my advocation videos for better mental health care in America on your page. They attacked me for advocating
This is America vibes..
This is amazing
this song isn't it - the delivery - everything lol - I tried
Omg ren kills it #impactthroughart
i love this
This man is a fucking genius so captivating. So true.. so...raw... I'm hocked
There is a sence of rhythm i havnt felt before, when holding the bottle, before the chair.  Plus the use of less is more is bravo from my heart, i felt like i just watched Romeo & Juliette, i feel a new feeling from this music video.   I think i relised how far away i am from where i should be ?
This is mind blowing
Ren, YOU ARE RHE MIST AMAZING PERSON EVER AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY WE LOVE YOU SO MUCH! Please get better
AMMMAAAZZZINNNG OMG...
Love u
this is America!
And here i was thinking that all originality and talent was gone.
I hope no father ever did this. LOVE
This is just PURE genius
Congratulations on the awards, Ren!!! So well deserved.
Bravo 🙌 respect is due
Thnk uu
Man, you are the Mozart of our time. Really love your work!
Song starts at 2:13
Age had something to do with it impressed color me 66 and I've heard every kind of music various. You're something… Still trying to place my finger… Which is good good.
You guys are so talented
I love this song but I don't like it at the same time.  Basically, my dad was very abusive and my brother still visits him for some reason. My brother showed me this song and said our father introduced him to it. I love the song and I checked it out but knowing I discovered it because of my abuser makes me dislike it a bit if that makes any sense.
Wow , strong words
Mold will grow up on the surface 😮
So educated. I'm guessing nothing has been easy.
wow
❤
This man’s music is modern Shakespeare
Congrats to the whole crew for the well deserved awards today. Powerful work.
I’m just surprised that Ren didn’t solve the Rubik’s Cube in three moves.
Well f#ck me running! Didn’t expect that ending. Frigg’n brilliant lyrics and video.
Listened to this 10 times and still picking up on some lines I missed. This is art.
No self shitttttr . Please
Omg.  I wish I had Ren as a professor.  Really. !
Google/YouTube is suppressing you. I watched this when you released it.Gave it a like then. Am rewatching it again, and it wasn't showing my 👍
Jaz e opera juntos são as coisas mais lindas por quem tem talento parabéns ren❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Thought provoking. Well done.
That was deep and magnificent!
masterpiece
Excelente poesia. I am a Brazilian musician living in New Zealand  and listening to your music and poetry now. So creative and inspiring 🎊.
It's not always about the music it's about the message
I can only stand to watch this every month or so because I always break down in tears even when I know why Jimmy is going to spiral away. A song for the ages.
Beautiful Made me think..
Damn
Jesus Christ brother. You get it. You see it. Freaking rare gift to humanity… I can’t believe you made it out and through what you did. Sending you massive love from the states and looking forward to your tour. #SeeYouInLosAngeles.
Genius
Ren. I adore your music. You are not just a musician but a story teller. A fable master of our time in true English fashion. All cultures have them. Someone who resonates and communicates via music. Thank you Lyza from New Zealand
Ren, you're really really good at delivering your passion to others
Music,lyrics,visuals..everything, another Masterpiece!!
Absolutely breathtaking! The scenery speaks to me, it looks identical to the place I'd go to find peace. Makoshika state park.
I feel like the start of Jimmys story is not that far from mine. I was so smart when I was young that I got offered to skip grades every single year. Yet I am grateful to my parents for refusing. I was smaller and weaker than others. Today there is only a year left to high school and I’m not rich. I’m normal except my talent in soccer
How did I get from Luigi to a full on short musical on huge societal issues
una obra maestra!!!!👏
I've only just noticed... why load five bullets? 😃
You are WONDERFUL!
Absolutely brilliant!
A fuckin MASTERPIECE! No other words can describe this artwork. Ren is already one of the grates in my eyes.
I made a stupid 'haha funny meme' comment a month ago, and I want to apologize.  I was coping because of how hard this hits, and it hits harder with every day that passes.
Ok I nt being a ass but is there a shadow n the hood. Or did you miss it with the base coat. I'm a custom painter and I'm by no means basing or hating just curious it looks great though.
Wow, wow, wow !!! Tellement beau, tellement vrai, tellement bien interprété, incredible talented artist.
Lin-Manuel Miranda?
I'd honestly love to see Ren at Eurovision /hj due to recent events
👏👏👏dope
What the fuk did I just watch?!!!!!!
sounds like a communist, no hate, ABSOLUTLY AWESOME
Really love your music love Amy renee
Listen to Marčelo-Pegla
🔥🔥🔥
gratitude
I have never felt like how i did while listening to this song. It's more than chills, and gets me everytime. Especially that ending. You and everyone involved did an amazing job, and have forever impacted many. Thank you! Nothing can beat your storytelling:)
I hope there are more stories to tell- your ability to fill my last 7 months with a 10 minute tale, that ties into an overall narrative of modern human greed, pain, and choice is phenomenal. Glad I know of REN.
I can't believe that this masterpiece has only 6 million views, how is that even possible. I personally listened to it at least 100 times. I hope that this work of art will see as many people as possible, bc Ren deserve to ne knows, and this story deserved to be heard as well as the big message behind it. Thank you so much for what you doing and who you are, Ren <3
The production and design on this is bloody exceptional.... everyone should be proud AF.
can i just say, he looks handsome
💓💓💓💕💓💓💓
The camera angle over the piano at the start chasing his fingers playing was just wow
Sorry but this shit sucks
Brilliant
Is that blaire white😊
I'm shocked by this video! 😳 It’s wonderful!!!
Rens an amazing artist. And this video makes you feel the song. Very well done!
This is more than just a music video, this is art. If I know anything about how the titular money game works, this art will get nowhere near as much attention as the latest greed-motivated slop.
This is an amazing piece of art... And for some reason my 2yr son listens to it constantly
ITS A MESSAGE NOT MUSIC
Amazing... just Amazing. Ren you are a lyrical mastermind, and fucking smart too!
Wow.❤
Someone's been listening to Grieg lately
Money, liberty and a m1911, huh.
Absolutely stunning video and stellar lyrics. A once in a lifetime talent 👌🏻
Fuck, howd i miss this?

https://youtu.be/ZMrPeEOBpA0?si=NFYIopw85WgAdbmA  The definig song frim the grad dads of industrial punk rock killing joke   I’d like Ren to cover this one   10/10 for money game part 3   Great clip and story
I genuinely just love Rens voice let alone the lyrics and cinematics
Ren is the voice of the natural man.
You remind me of the late 90s & early 2000s…..the time of enlightenment in the new era. Keep rockin REN you are killing it. Love from the US.
Masterpiece. This doesn't deserve an Oscar, it's in a league of it's own (and doesn't need the approval of a "celebrity" organization anyway). An ingenious storytelling too with a great message that we as an over-consuming society needs to hear and heed. Hope you can stay as grounded as possible on the road towards your inevitable increased celebrity!
Dear Ren, where have you been all my life 🥺
Beautiful
this guy is like the punk version of sting
King of the one take. What a genius.
should be OST of peaky blinder
Is that tommy shelby?
Should this man ever compose and create a complete musical, I'll be sitting in the first row.
Ahhh, this is my typeee🥵
I Highly Support This.
That was very hard for me, this "Is real life", my solution?
Damn your the shit Ren u are so fuki. Talented and I think  that  your  Dental is alot sharper then  ALOT OF Great  one's
it's beautiful mate. Pure gem. Can't imagine how you'd fit all this in a concert. Your creation kept me deep in the story.
My path started at 27 I was crazy didn’t end till I was 49 too crazy to medicate all the time I felt like everything you have song you sing makes all the children off the light strange how a order I Carnt go without medication from trauma didn’t end till then I detoxed and now I’m in medicated and 52 just starting to be able to create again I’m a artist in the whole time I only got glimpses off being able to work I also raised 5 kids ect and here I am new beginnings just starting thank you ren thank you so very much I have chronic illness now from what the unneeded meds they pumped into me and many pills for all the side effects they fried my brain everyone has a story and every story has a end I might have 5 chronic illness’s now to live with but I’d rather do it all on my own steam pick myself off dust myself off and live as me the new me that I alone am the driver in my own mind and I am just getting my range off emotions back it feels amazing I am becoming a whole person again for a few years all I did was break down over what was done to me because the traumas I have been threw needed to be medicated forced down my throat and I was only free after over 20 years because they didn’t work so here try this again in the hamster wheel I’m not going to be down about it anymore because I’ve already lost so much to the pain off being medicated so now I just want to share love and kindness and grow finally grow and heal
Immediate Trump vibes as soon as he stood up from the piano
Pretty powerful…headed for bed and will probably dream about this. This is one of the best videos, next to Childish Gambino’s “This is America”, I’ve seen. I hope one day I can see him in the flesh, it would truly make my bucket list complete!
Ren, you are brilliant. Wow.
It's incredible that with all of the garbage mainstream music that's consuming the radio and Spotify and every other music platform by artists who are making millions and aren't that great that you have to scour YouTube and hope that the algorithm sends you an artist like this who is exponentially better than anything that's on Apple music right now. This guy is definitely a musician a storyteller and talented
I love U pull 👍💙
Finally....finally well done, well thought out art.  Thank you for sharing.  Truth is more important than chasing money.
🙉🙈🙊
This is uncomfortable....I LOVE it!
💙❤️🧡💛💚
Question by any chance will there potentially maybe hopefully a money game part 4
Am I the only one here who sees Thomas Shelby?😅
I am loving it!!
Thomas Shelby if Peaky Blinders was a musical.
Yup... parasites of the world living today, who did know, that the money, power and fame -- can corrupt individual to alter their self, in the self loathing freedoms at the expense of the others who living and pray...  Poetry, music playing and artist speak loud... but again, you need dollars to be able to play, in the world based plutocracy -- or -- the death chocking those who are not willing give more, to receive less, to abrupt fast, to corrupt mass -- sing a song, since we speak no evil, and only good omens, thus let you live a life full of hopes and blind forces ...

Commenting cus i need more of this. Its excellent. A true masterpeice. We need more artists like you
it's awesome.. ren has an indescribable talent and he is very wise
I'm a few months late to this party, but I think people are overlooking a key detail of this story. When Ren pulls the trigger, all we hear is the "CLACK" because the gun isn't racked. In my mind, he could have added a gunshot in post production to drive the point home...but why didn't he?  Whether I'm looking too deep or not  I see it as Jimmy's .45 failing to fire, and failing to end his life. He sits there, soaking wet, still alive, realizing his suicide attempt failed because of such a tiny action. He has to sit there, suddenly faced with the choice to rack that slide.  An optimist might see this as him suddenly having a second chance, possibly even an epiphany. He could use that chance to turn things around and start using that wealth to fight the very same system he abused to rise to his position. He could finally take his finger off the trigger and use his immense power and wealth to fix what he did wrong.  Would he? I don't know. The story ended the moment that trigger was pulled. We have no idea if it goes any further. But if it does, I see that as an option.
First time have heard o REN one hour ago. Great Great
Гениальный чувак!
wow just wow
7:20  the solution is john 8:12  Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
Majestic, really damn astonishing
This reminds me of richard corey by simon and garfunkel. Genius. Pefect for our time.

I see that edit at 5:10; smooth af. If not for the liquid level in the liquor bottle no one would know.
Peak storytelling
bravissimo, Cillian Murphy
💶
can we all agree that all 3 money games are better as music videos than the audio on spotify? like- seriously the audio on the video and spotify are two different things.
Some songs give you goosebumps the first time you hear it, Ren's music does it EVERY time you hear it
not sure if bored or annoyed or why i haven't clicked close tab yet but you have the eyes of a psychopath which fascinates and scares me, to see a real one
This is more than a song. This is a warning and a story
First time ever see or hearing from this artist, but he has mad talents and mesmerizing!!!
Brilliant
Mind blown!
This is truly a MASTERPIECE. The flow is crazy.
nice.. childish gambino inspired mv
Wow! Just Wow! 😮 You‘re an absolute genius!
There are no music videos I want to watch again and again, like this. Thanks again, Ren. The plot is tight, every detail has meaning. And it is good meaning. Art without substance never moves me. Thanks, balm for my soul in these soulless times.
Well damn ren... Future and passed all in a won ballad! Gunna plaster this everywhere!
I'd also like to say that I've never wanted to have a camera in my hand as much as I did watching this. So many little shots I would have loved to catch.
yes
This is my first time liistening to Ren. This video was beautiful. I sat here watching and listening in awe. I don't have words to describe how fucking awesome this is.
Masterpiece
Gosh... Art that actually works. A masterpiece indeed.
Woah
Oh holy moment!  I am happy that I watched; this is deeply meaningful.  Epic and interesting contribution.
Damn i loved this Masterpiece
ONE GOD, ONE WORLD, ONE LOVE 🦋🌎❤️
You are amazing Ren ❤
Powerful
This is so excellently executed.
Eminem doesn't have shit on this kid.I love your story lines and honesty with a real fucking message.  Love from American
What a masterpiece
Thank you, Ren.  The world needs you and this type of message.  Please continue fighting and inspiring!
oof
The piano skills of Tony Banks, the lyricism of Eminem, the theatrical presence of Peter Gabriel. Stunning performance.
Fantastic.
I' m crying, Brother!
He’s a genius.
Everyone can form a cell between 2-5 people to affect change with direct action.
Well then, Ren isn’t wrong. F the money and the poly-tics (many bloodsuckers)
Amazing! >;D
Ren. I am still believing you have vocals like Mercury.  Love on the vine of life sent Straight to you. Like fungi in the forest floor. Hey , side note ,Ren. Don't Syd Barrette it  man. We need you. We appreciate you. I do      at least. N I'm fuckn someone.  N I bet there more someone's than we allllllll know.

Luigi is selling shells with this one
원래 약간 슈게이즈 스런 느낌이 랩에 있었는데 이젠그냥 락,슈게이즈로 바꾼건가 싶은 곡인듯 국내에서 이제 힙합은 장르와 스타일을 빌려와야 먹히지않나 싶음
Smart... is an understatement. The lyric you breath is more then a word to the wise!! Is a shame we're breaking such a beautiful world when really only 1 % of the life thar inhabits it is aware we could fly love and share in unity if you only just use the brain and intelligence given too us by a creation of something/ someone/somewhere. But the world has only used that brain to have looked up the definition of parasites and how to be it. So sad the light ain't turned on sooner. 🎼🎶🎵  Every lyric you spit it guenis mate. Your Reay getting me through the fight xo❤
Ok hold on I just realised ren kinda looks like Oppenheimer
BRAVO!!!!
БРАВО!
musics that connects. damn good
This is glorious!
Awesome job.
Amazing form of storytelling and music. This trilogy f-ing rules and i’ll be sharing it with my friends and siblings.
This is frigging brilliant
This embodies...epitomizes the phrase, "a work of art".  Gentlemen, I am grateful for you.
part 1 - what the money game does to the poor  part 2 - what the money game does to us all  part 3 - what the money game does to the rich...
@Ren can U pls Collab with boywithuke or NF
Eff-me! I'm not only speechless, I'm typeless.
My bipolar grandmother worked in nuclear medicine with iodine and lead pads. She wore the old 50's nurse's cap. She ended up with extreme skin cancer that transferred to being brain cancer that made her so ill that she died. She barely knew who people were and every nurse in that nursing home cried when she died. She helped and healed many patients. Always patient and calm with every one. Refused drugs of many drug-addicted patients and always followed HIPPA strictly to a tee.
My abuelo got to learn how repair guns, sell cigars (Checkers cabs), factory work, repair A/C, chemist, business man, and traffic cop in Cuba. He was a great man. I grew up with a plastic spoon like my abuelo but lived a good life for what it is.
Glad I found Ren. I only comment on YT once a year...This is it... 🏆
Fuck. This dude really makes powerful music. Holy shit dude
You are such a genius and what a blessing you are to the people of this world who listen to the truth you share.

Nice with a VERY big N
If we are not experiencing it all first hand, there is something or a someone inbetween us and it. Either we are following teachers or scriptures, we are following just another feeling towards the same thing that we are experiencing ourselves right here in this now, in our slightly different but still same imperfect now. When learning any kind of passed down information no matter where on the spectrum of truth it is ranging, we are by doing so un-learning ourselves to put ourselves under & add on someone else's inner stance, which with time are going to make us, our inner being, into more of a copy than an actual self. Life is live, feel, learn and re-remember and the life we live is the teacher itself, where by living it we should be growing into living books of knowledge, if we actually live it for ourselves. We are both the teacher and the student, as we are both the observer and the one who project the whole moving picture that we see infront of us and dive into each new day when we open our eyes and the camera is again for us, rolling. We are all playing a lead-role in a meaningless story called life. Meaningless until we give it our  meaning & then we are acting as each others mirrors as well, reflecting all that greatness but also the inner work which we are taught to just brush under the carpet. So really, we should be grateful for all interaction with life as there is a teacher in absolutely everything. When breaking it down, all we truly have is our energy and together with our energy all we truly need in this life is good health, good morals and a fine-tuned instrument, as in us, to express ourselves properly with, in order to free our minds. let the caged bird fly! Follow no one who wishes followers but the one's who encourage you to live your life for you and to walk your own path. Only by doing so we'll truly know who we are and what we are truly here for. We have it all already & we need no middle-men in order to stay connected to ourselves as we are that creators energy...we are it. We are all born out of it and we're given a slightly different perspective to take in the experience with for a reason. So not to fall for false light. Saying that though, we can not escape what we are not first aware of. We are all god until it finds a way to poison the mind. 💜
where can i find the other parts?
how have i missed this?!
hoooh..great and strong :)
Genius of our generation
n
amazing
Broadway now
Completely fantastic
Eurovision winner listened to REN.
How has this not only been nominated but not received an actual golden globe. There are so many aspects to this song it's absolute poetry. The video is 💯 cinematic, so complimentary, so real. So felt..
Watching this premier live was a fantastic experience, the countdown, the atmosphere, and the best part is it lived up to the expectations of the previous two parts.
Absolute genius 👏👏👏
Okay, let's get deep in the subject for a minute. ⚠ Money is not the problem. Money is a misused good solution, that derives from the real root of all evil, the notion of property. Many ugly behaviors also derive from this notion, like racism, sexism, homophobia and all discriminations or oppressions, because they all look to set a group of us, the good, and a group of them, the bad, who can be abused and used to create wealth for those powerful enough to make those groups rules. There is a psychological logic to that, but the aim of the civilisation is exactly to avoid that by providing security to the entire group. So, we shall ban property, there is plenty and enough proof for it, but it ain't done for this notion is so well implanted in people's minds. The problem in our society, that is rich enough to feed, shelter, care, educate, have productive occupation and entertain the whole population, is that some of the most powerful people don't believe in civilisation any more, on two levels: they had to abuse or rob plenty of people to get to that position, and they allow privileges only to those who do the same. Super rich and super powerful are tolerated only because of the notion of property.  The second big issue in our civilization is the notion I call "mechanisism" for we think machines will solve all our problems, and we forget that humans are still better at it. Okay, it's true that industry and technical science have given a great boost to humanity lately, but it's not the one and all. In the meantime, we didn't make any progress in human sciences, like sociology, psychology nor politics. We have the world in the palm of our hand but we still think like 200 years ago. Worse, we think and act more and more with passion and envy rather than with reason and wisdom. And lying became a sport.  Back to Ren's artwork; the emphasis for my these is repeated twice: "Mine, mine, give me". Also, a great solution is highlighted in the shadows of the story and more clearly in the conclusion: Education is key. We need to teach all youth (even the old ones) to care, to respect, to share... Peace & Love, y'all!
Love. So happy you're in this world right now.
Did i forgot to say free Palestine ?
I've been listening to Rens music since I found the Blind Eyed live cover on youtube one night in highschool. My jaw has been on the floor since the start of this video, this is the epitome of practise makes perfect. This is a cinema and musical masterpiece
I feel so lucky, until now I have felt like I've been born in the wrong era, that I would never hear anything special, like it's all been done before but the way you incorporate all genres of music from medieval times till now a days music it's amazing. I love it that at such a young age you've worked out what's important in life x
Ren, I think you just created a masterpiece! I edited this comment so many times, because I can't find the right words to describe this. The music, the lyrics, the video, the acting, everything was perfect.
Wow. That wasn’t a song. That was a tragedy jesus
Long awaited trilogy. Really liked the second. Can’t believe i missed this
The sum of this singular piece of work is powerful & wise & profound enough to obliterate most of the insipid, banal, weak, money-fuelled garbage that is churned out for the masses (pigeons & sheep).  If Ren & Sam do decide to create a 'full length' theatre play/production ... can I audition please? Much respect 💥 EK
true art.
Man, these lyrics. That's what I've been telling since my 16th year, but who cares, who listens, while the world is nearing it's life-supporting end.  Brilliant.
This man speaks truth.
Is this song about Biden and son
maisas ant galvos, nes matyt lidle apsipirko. #TeamBug
I want the World to see this! In hope of change our hearts and turn us all to human beings.  Hi Ren, thank you for being. ❤
tommy shelby because the greatest musician of modern music
Jesus Christ, this guy's knocking out numbers like nobody's business!
This is so much more than music. Wow. Just wow.
Ren be our eurovision next year this year was shit ireland should've won
Masterpiece ! @ from France
Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy One years old and his first words were mine, mine gimme Two years old, he was walking, three years old, walking quickly Four years old, he was running around the pavements of his city Five years old, and his daddy told him, listen here son, you've got to learn to be a man A man he works for what he wants Six years old, and he's reading, writing, top of the bunch And when he's seven, his progression made him student number one Eight years old and he's praised for unusual grades Nine, his parents pay for private school to nurture the flame 10, 11, 12, 13, he ascends and ascends, his daddy tells him, son, money is the means to all ends 14 solving complex mathematic equations, at 15, IQ 150, still elevating 16 he develops complex software code that detects weaknesses in cyber security protocol 17, and he sells his vision, keeping the share, not yet an adult But he's practically a millionaire 18, and his daddy tells him now you're a man the world don't give a damn about you So take all that you can 19, he turns a profit, stocks and shares, invest in product 20, double down deposits 21, his income rockets 22, he learns that truth is just an obstacle to wealth If you manipulate the data, then the lie will sell itself 23, a life of luxury Crystal and cocaine 24, he makes the Forbes list, they're applauding his name 25, and his daddy told him, listen here, son, while you're sitting in the palace That don't mean that you won 26, his business shifts, he switches business to arms He's 27, dealing nuclear shells in Iran 28, inside the Senate, money bought him a seat He's 29, role of counsel in the president suite And now he's 30, his daddy says, you're losing the race You're just a servant to the king, not even in second place 31, a big maneuver for his daddy's approval Moving imports over borders from the exports out of Cuba 32, moving grams, growing kilo to tons He's 33, filling warehouses with powder and guns 34, turf war with nobody to stop it, blind eye from the Po po inside of his pocket 35, he gets a call, I'm sorry, son, but it's your father, had a heart attack I'm sorry, he's gone, 36, getting pissed off abusing this product 37, eyes glazed, disposition demonic 38, with a prostitute, a moment of passion Heating up the silver spoon and then chasing the dragon 39, getting reckless and hungry for power Daddy's words still driving him to kill him and devour He makes a move against the cartel, but the strategy's flawed They retaliate and leave him in the hospital ward A bullet buried in his vertebra, and one in his leg The doctor sighs and says, I don't think you'll be walking again, fuck Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy He was 40 and he cursed the words mine, mine gimme 41, he wasn't walking, 42, not walking quickly, 43 Never running round the pavements of his city 44 inside a palace with a mountain of gold But those riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves Weighing heavy on his conscience is the value of gold, Lamborghini for a life Trading money for souls, Jimmy followed the code inside the land of the free Put your hand inside the cookie jar, take more than you need And his example is exaggerated versions of me, and it's a version of him And it's a version of she, and it's a version of you There's no escaping the blame, the way we live, it's parasitic Fuck the money and fame, cut the music This isn't entertainment, this is real life, the way we live is lunacy, community it declines We're hyperpolarized, we're always fighting and we divide Truth is less important than the money that we designed? Money's an invention, politics from our invention, they all come from people's ideas Did I mention, border's an invention Law and order fuels the tension that leads to people killing each other My solution? Everything is subject to change We could build utopias if individuals were taught to use their brains But if we teach kids in schools to always be sheep and put themselves before the herd If there's more money for meat Then there's no future I see where the humans survive We're parasites inside the Petri dish, with cannibal mines Mold will grow upon the surface, then consumes 'til it dies And our fate could be the same without this story to the wise 45, Jimmy comes home out of the rain, soaking wet upon a wheelchair Drinking again, he has everything he wants, he has fortune and fame Such a fortunate fool with an unfortunate fate with a 45 caliber aimed at his brain 45, a fitting number because his age is the same Here's the words of his father, it's such a damn shame Then he presses on the trigger of a money game
3:50 transition was elite!
Ang galing!
Goosebumps
he is a modern day shaman.        his articulate wisdom and visceral intent are transcendent
OH FCK
This dude would make a great Joker!

Great song. Reminds me of the thieves banquet by akala
Dude all your songs I mean... relax, life is beautiful, can be painful too. This is too tragic for me, all songs are about the same tbh. You are talented, but you suffer from being British.
I shouldn't have waited so long to watch this, I'm sorry
this is fucking masterpiece
Wow I’m shook
Nejsi to co jsi byl..,

JS: Ren jest mistrzem storytellingu w swoich tekstach, a ten teledysk potęguje przekaz jego utworu. Uważam że genialnie wykorzystano tak pozornie nudną przestrzeń jaką jest zwykły magazyn. Klip jest pełen zwrotów akcji i angażujących wydarzeń ale daje przestrzeń na wybrzmienie artyście. Niesamowita robota ekipy filmowej, świetna kontrola kamery na wymagającym rigu oraz oświetlenia. Wisieńką na torcie jest fakt, że klip nagrany jest praktycznie jednym takiem.
Wow,wow,wow - the truth about money and our twistet world perception!!! Bombastic, dramatic song👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Wow…
He channels Cillian Murphy
Wow
Was Jimmies name Cindy the whole time 😂 jk it looked like female hands from observance 😅 but 😮i git goosebumps and felt the freedom of the flow when I seen the nodding of ren like yeah we vibin 2nd verse in

Splendide prod et clip ..Bravo
Surprised to see Oppenheimer go down the music route. Guess this is his way of clearing his conscience of the bombs.

Hair Style is like Peaky Bliders 😮😮
Wow just Wow
When I watch Ren's videos I actually tear up, because he proves music can still be art... No one else is doing what he does or even coming close. Amazing work!
Your music is insanely moving it gets your mind moving and i love it.
We must "protect" Ren at all costs! Our world needs him more than we can realize!
WOW so powerfull ! money is not the power!
In today's tumultuous world, where political agendas seem to serve only the interests of a select few, your presence is a beacon of hope and unity. Amidst the chaos, your commitment to bridging divides and upholding strong ethical values shines through, a rare trait in the current political landscape.  From my perspective, gleaned from observing your actions and those of other voices like Russel Brand, it's become evident that both ends of the political spectrum harbor ideas essential for fostering a harmonious and prosperous society. The key lies in finding common ground and allowing practicality and reason to guide us forward. Formerly entrenched in left-leaning beliefs, I've come to recognize, with the guidance of individuals like yourself, the importance of embracing a collective vision that prioritizes the well-being of the majority over the interests of a privileged few.  Thank you for championing rationality and compassion in a world increasingly defined by division. Your influence has been instrumental in guiding me towards enlightenment and understanding.  And on a lighter note, your musical talents never fail to astound! Apologies for veering into the political realm, but I genuinely believe that the pervasive influence of vested interests has fractured our society. Individuals like you, however, are instrumental in shedding light on the importance of common-sense solutions. Thank you for your unwavering dedication to the greater good.
So zack snyder stole from this. Hes such a hack lol
Well done
We all battle demons, but we all can't put into words what our battle is.  You give us hope knowing that someone out there gets it.
Amazing 😮 Don't you ever sell your soul to them Ren 😢
Nice and real!
Глубоко!!!👏👏👏 Не ожидала такого протеста против мира лжи на Западе!✊️🤝Поздравляю! Не все продали душу!👍
Занесло по пьянке, пока. Там где мани, не наша тема😂😂😂Вы больны

Caralho
wow that was awsome
He has made some insanely amazing pieces that... words can't express. I'm in awe of his passion and talent. His vision and expression of that which truly digs the deepest is unparalleled.  Ren I salute you.
Now poetry designs exactly what you surmise so therefore you see now what I can try don't let yourself now get bigger than you can surmise for the kids
Then quit
My man straight up looks like a peaky blinder

Unbelievabe talent. Expression, openness, truth and honesty = healing , enlightenment and spiritual elevation. The journey from darkness to light that we need to reclaim, which we once had , but lost beyond our control when being conditioned from young by well meaning lost souls...

Soo good !
Money Game is so powerful...All lessons learned the hard way. As I sit in a waiting room crying, watching this, knowing and relating to it. You are touching millions with your music.
Holy sh** ! THIS is ART ! You guys are amazing . Come play in France !!
Brilliant
Personally I am not a parasite, some are, some aren't. Society is a construct? Yes, based upon thousands of years of development. Nihilism is not becoming. People seem to not comprehend how bad things can become, for an inkling research Soviet Communism.
Oxxximyron stile)  Ren the best)
Wow. 🤩 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
bro this is the definition of art . .
First video i saw was Hi Ren. The money game series of songs takes what I think in my head and put it into words I can never thank you enough for that. I really enjoy the attention to detail and the live guitar being able to hear the room noise that is something missing from the overly produced crap you hear nowadays.
❤
Wow. Simply...wow. I'm 60 years old (well, in June). Poetic. Intelligent, nay brilliant. Artistic. Musical. Genius. And so, SO true.
Genius.  [The End].
This is a Beauty in Desguise 😅 cause of the head wrapping Yepp this video is a masterpiece and it should be recognized much more than that Great job 👏🏻👏🏻🫡🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️

Wow! YouTube's algorithm brought me here. Honestly, I don't even know what to say properly. This was undoubtedly the best video I've ever seen in my entire life. Guys, congratulations. My thanks. You've created a masterpiece. Simply perfect down to the smallest details. Impressive.
No money No Honey 🎉❤😊
OMG I LOVE THIS
I first heard ren's admission and thought i was special. now i know that i'm just like a lot of others, coping, dealing, with the same issues. i hate my life and so do most of you. i'm so sorry you have to go through the same shit as all of us. but I am here with you to say that you aren't alone. <3
the artist/musician that has been missing for the last half a century
Truth is less important than money. Thanks Ren. I feel less alone in this fuckin madness
Wow! Such amazing story telling xxxxxxx
Ren is the goat!
Cool art
Good story telling brah....(Lekin) But not as expected from u seeing ur most of the album just don't over pronounce the words it sounds like a shitty undisciplined dump rude [( bacha )] I mean kid..... Nonsense It would had been better if you hadn't pronounced it like a kid... instead like a (mard) Manly man.... Ah no use😔 saying also ....🙄
No way I'm late by 6 months
Respect
🔥 🔥 🔥 how many fire emojis are appropriate for such an anti emoji song. Pure genius.

Ahora todos los ingleses quieren ser piki blinders

Fkn Awesome piece of work.....  stunning.
British Em, for real,  with his own style,  but the independence,  the carefree, the swag, the middle finger to establishment
What if they all said no One day, all the soldiers Out there fighting for the illusion Of safety Of honor Of freedom What if they buried bullets Into all our greed Instead of inside bodies And then planted music So one day the notes carried A symphony of hope on the wind Instead of the scent of war What if we made broken people whole Asked them what they needed And then did it Instead of killing them for hating servitude What if we freed caged hearts And offered them unfenced territory Then lived together in an unchained melody With the wind at our backs And the cold winds met With the warmth of our togetherness What if we loved The way lovers love With everything else fading No other needs but each other An open flame Under an endless sky Waging nothing but peace And the surety of tomorrow Love so well fed and tended That it banishes all that would vanquish it With nothing but a shrug and a slight smile Because that is what faith in someone else does And we all deserve it That mustard seed that can save the world From all its flaws From all its guns From all its wars If we would only If we would only If we would only Say yes to saying no.
Thats amazing
Dude it's illegal to be this talented! I hope you THRIVE in fame man.
Real life joker.. This is how real life feels like for us depressed and suicidal.. i cannot even spoke a word bc this is perfect.. Keep it up, love you Ren! Be the spoken word !
Шелби
what a fucking journey this was, holy shit.  bravo on this piece, truly remarkable
There are so many aspects of this piece to admire. If you want to further appreciate its instrumental brilliance, i recommend watching Virgin Rock’s reaction. It’s quite different than all others i’ve watched.
one of the best.
WOW!
This is pure musical genius, great artistic expression, amazing storytelling, poetry in motion... This should be seen by all!
uh what is this WHAT IS THIS
Your storytelling is truly one of a kind. Well done!
I'm not very good at history, but for some reason this reminds me of Churchill. How close am I?

A species that has struggled and clawed to survive will always find a way to do so. You HAVE to eliminate and reduce the ways in which one can achieve this aim that hurt others.  We should not expect people to be good, to make good decisions. We shouldn't give them a choice, because when you are so limited by whatever information is given to you through culture, finances, geography, your choices are limited.  You have to design a system that doesn't expect good behavior, but simply makes it default. Being a good person isn't just a standard, it is normalcy. We have badly messed up our code of society when we leave room for people to profit and win the survival game by doing things that reduce the time and quality of others survival. Remove the incentive. Remove the reward, no matter how it is earned and you won't see that behavior.  We all agree that human life has value, in theory, not in practice. We're still too stuck trying to survive because others for whatever reason or another have taken paths in which their aim of survival reduces the chances of ours. We make things dog eat dog with the system we have. We have to change the system itself, the things we approve of and why and remove rewards for abhorrent behavior, no matter what the drive for doing it is, survival or greed, because greed is just future fear over survival that is pre-emptive. I take more now in case I need it later, even if I don't need it now, I might. Greedy people are scared. Remove fear and you find that we're a pretty docile species. How do I know this? We're all fucking terrified, yet music like this is made. Messages like this are understood and heard. We're not in fact falling apart like we think we are because people have empathy. We understand our personal survival is dependent on those around us and no one does anything alone. Thinking that they do inflates ego and distorts reality that everything that exists doesn't exist by itself. Everything interplays off of other things to make something new. The horrors our reality has still have bright moments, which proves to me our species isn't doomed. It's just not fun to realize how much further we all need to go, how much we have to work on and how disillusioned we've been. All trying to find the answer and struggling to find the cause of the disease so that we can fix it.
That is the content we all need from the internet ❤
Here comes peaky blinders

"We could build utopias if individuals were taught to use their brains."
Congratulations Ren, you have reached me far. haahahaha I'm Brazilian, and you gained +1 fan here in Brazil. Many years ago my ears didn't make my skin crawl and my eyes cry with the quality of music. Authenticity, Originality and perfect execution of quality, talent and work. Just congratulations on the work.
Refleshing, watchin this after a busy work day

You are killing the american dream or is it vice versa?

So happy to saw it in my recommandations, amazing work !
Love this song/musical/his acting!  A man of many talents!
What would a utopia absent of law and order look like? Mike fisher philosophy number 2 do not subtract something of value or purpose without adding in something of equal value to replace it. Be it that the kids education be the ways by which this utopia is achieved. Philosophy, in particular stoicism being part of the criculum would be a start. But also most people who harm others do it out of boredom or desperation. Be it boredom the agreeved should be allowed justice in that the harmer should be punished by them or a champion of there choosing or parent in cases of children. Something like a few punches for a minor offense to a plethora of weapons and tools be given and then harmed one or champion get freedom of execution and immunity from retaliation. This would be a honor/justice system to replace it.
Now that's art.
Masterpiece ❤✨
I really like the scenery
Great job on the win.
This real is a masterpiece ✨️ 🙌  you're speaking on what so many of us are thinking, feeling, going through. ♥️

Talking about genius lyricsm....ren ..!!
Wow. This is masterpiece. It's fascinating how the media is flooded with rappers who have nothing to say except to perpetually exhibit their inflated exaggerated egos, and I come across such a gem more or less by accident.
This is it I found my idol
Congrats on your continued success Ren

Wow
A true visionary artist. Amazing!
Love this. Its a movie.
this gave me goosebumps
You know what's an invention ? Human rights.
This is amazing, even the rich can't stop this financial agenda. You'll own nothing and be....... happy apparently 😂
Story telling in its true meaning. One of the best i ever heard. Big respect for your talent.
A masterpiece
How am I just now finding this guy, he is too good not to be a house hold name.
got an abo bro.
I cannot get enough of this, everything about it perfection!!
😢
Tommy Shelby of the music industry ❤😢😮😮😮😮
oh wow
This should be regarded as a classic for the future.
I get the feeling Ren doesn't like capitalism much 😂
Pure Genius!  ❤
art!
Today my father told me that he was diagnosed with cancer. I dont know how to start a conversation about that my Friends. I feel lost.
Genius!
SORRY FOR MY ENGLISH, IM BRAZILIAN - that said,  My main characters name in a book written in 2017 called The Forgotten World is Ren. I just knew your songs in 2020, and since then i'm a huge fan of your style, your voice, your way of seeing this world. In every word, i see my own thoughts left in the pages of the 3 books i wrote. I know you probably won't give a damn about that, but i feel so represented in your masterpieces, feel so alive and it feels SO GOOD to know that maybe i'm not crazy after all... Love your art, and i hope it spreads as much as it can, all the success and love from here and i'll always share to everyone so they know you.
He could be a awesome Far Cry boss!
Wow
Welcome to 2024 that's all I can say
bro my 1 year old is running and talking................................... she a smart or something?
Im binging all your music on here right now. Dying in love with EVERYTHING! Amazing!
I'd come up with a song or a rap that would make you want to run so please son quit taking the cheese out the trap if you don't want to get snapped because guess what 3:56 I got your rhymes like that and the timing that hangs out like a gnat 4:01 can I breathe into a fly that you can see 🙈 and now I'm stirring but yet I'm flirting with what you're stirring 4:08 and I'm not even in second place because third is the wind fourth is what I despise just like second is a loser and I'm first in my life 4:15
the end gets me every time. the thematic rhyme...
I want know how he had those bags over his head
Wow Wow wow!!! Unreal Talent! Fucking Brilliant Lyricists!!!
He should do the next bond song!
Why didn't I find this sooner
Ren, please get on touchtunes my dude! I want to blast you at the bar so everyone can hear this.
This is way too underrated
Ren reminds me of Hopsin
If you do a musical… please do a peaky. Blinder Tommy 🖤 you’d be perfect… the darkness of some of your music just fits his character so well! Can’t wait to see you tour hopefully in California 🇺🇸
Did they do that all in 1 maybe 2 takes????  Ren is next level
Master Piece just amazing
It's a crime this doesn't have many more million views! It's a masterpiece with a very important message ❤❤
Imagine Ren going to a president post 😮
❤
Amazing!
I was fucking doing maths and never knew money game had a part 3??? It's been months that i have been listening to Money game 1 and 2. Algorithm is slow so here to boost it. Ren Your artwork is genius, Doing maths while your music running in background helps it somehow. Thanks. Much love to the whole team!! <3
My life currently and still on progression
Jesus Christ, so fucking raw. He ain't wrong, there is definitely something wrong with the world, everyone out for themselves doesn't work but then again neither does athletes taking PEDs but we all know how that ended or rather how the athletes are better at hiding it. When everyone around you is a crook, a liar and a manipulative fuck, what choice do you have but to be one yourself to survive?
Stop the music.  The daily grind.  Love life!
good
😮 Just Leaving Another Appreciation for The Masterpiece Here & The algorithm ❣️❣️🐷🐰😎💜💙 Thank You Again REN!!;)
💋 like always
😢
Just WOW!
Lyrically astonishing 🙌Thank you youtube algorithm
On this day I discovered ren x so many thoughts and feelings- 2secs in- wtf is this? 4secs in- he looks and sounds weird - I’m 41 why am I listening to this shit ?! - by end of song (performance) I’m hooked x this boy is a genius!!
Truth. Fact. Wake-up.
I love how you can hear the accent every song
He’d make a great Frank N Furter
Can not believe I have only just stumbled across this dude. Absolutely unreal. Every track I listen to blow my mind man 🤯👌🏻 WOW
This is beautifully insane ❤
masterpiece
No one will ever see the post who can get it to Ren, but a serious statement and hats off cover, with built in rap for modernized extra context, would be to cover Bob Dylan’s changing of the guard. Please give it a go :)
This dude is a Genius!! This is my genre of music. Will support you definitely!!
didn't know hunter Biden went by 'jimmy' 😂😂
Thankful for your and Samʻs vision of the thoughts and insights going through your mind. The crazy paradoxes of our lives can be seen and heard and pondered. It is moving and profound.
Comment for the algorithm. Amazing
Great job. Love everything you stand for Ren. Keep it up 🙏
Luigi went hard with this one
Ren you are amazing!!! Love, hugs, and peace. ❤❤❤
I LUV U!!! My daughter knows all the lyrics to this song if u could heart this it would make me and my daughters day! Ty Ren and once again luv u
just wow..... that piano...... way to set the bar high guys, absolutely awesome.
Does anyone else get sad like me when he gets to 40 coz you know the artistic mastery will end in 5 more.
hey Ren, who's the pianist at the very intro?
Watching Peaky Blinders at the moment and can not, not see Ren as Thomas Shelby :D
This kid is wild!
I just got here …. And I ain’t leaving 🙌
What is that beginning beat. I swear to God I know it but can not place it
Does ren ever reply on his social media accounts?
Man could be rich if we went back in time when salt was currency 😂 dark humor 🎉
This does not fade , its staya and marinates inside ur brain
Quality work of art
my best part :: 44 inside a palace with a mountain of gold but those ruches turned to rubber when perspective evolved weighing heavy on his conscience was the value of gold
God bless John 3:11 through 21 Jesus loves you Jesus saves!   ‭‭John‬ ‭3:11‭-‬21‬ ‭ESV‬‬ [11] Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know, and bear witness to what we have seen, but you do not receive our testimony. [12] If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things? [13] No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man. [14] And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, [15] that whoever believes in him may have eternal life. [16]  “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. [17] For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. [18] Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. [19] And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. [20] For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. [21] But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God.”
I have watch this masterpiece many times and i just have to say how beautiful his pauses are❤
Startling and brilliant <3
I will never get tired of remembering that i am not alone in this consuming society listening to this masterpiece
i love the story telling in ur tunes. Powerful !!
Seriously Incredible. Commentary on society from a music video that in my humble opinion sits up there with "This is America" by Childish Gambino
Is this song about hunter Biden lol
Just came across this and I loved every lyric apart from the end, hate to see that even if it’s not visable.. 🫤 at the end of the day tho it’s your music and the lyrics tell a story and I love it, not like these jibberiah artists nowadays
It's telling the story of My life
Powerful message Ren,  there is still salvation for the damned  It may not be on time or go according to plan If you got money and status you can become the invisible hand
I can only echo what everyone else says, just one word, "masterpiece"
Life is a game with any retrying if u take the wrong path u lose and only the strongest can bring it
we are all, no matter where you are, subject to a system that is against you. everyone who cares? their ideas is to give to microphone and money to whoever will grab a megaphone. I agree that money doesn't make happiness, but it does make it so that you don't have to survive and it it sad, that in a 1st world country vs a 3rd world that's what you're doing, we're all just doing different types of survival and I think that we're all going down hill, whether its the LGBTQ or women's rights, there are so many people who are willing to fight for what they believe in, but yet I see no one standing up to the laws and the government. I live in Scotland, and even though I know people are pro LGBTQ I am scared of what the UK says and the rights that us trans people will be denied. I just wish everybody thought one way, and one way being either biology, or religion, because both ways have their problems, but science is always evolving, religion isn't. being trans is biological, religion isn't, it is TAUGHT. no matter what country you live in you cannot teach someone to be LGBTQ+ and that daily, is a proven FACT. You, as an LGBTQ member, can make the conscious decision to obviously not live as you should feel comfortable, but you can, but that doesn't mean it is healthy. Trans people suffer daily. Anyone who is going against their biology, which may fall under the LGBTQ+, will suffer in their own way. This system is BROKEN! And we shouldn't allow people who want the system to degenerate and such, to do so. I love this song, for that, since it shows how BROKEN this system is and how generationally, it has been passed down.
Glorious! Happy off you Ren
Deeeeeeep
He is a lyrical genius
this is a Masterpiece
Continuity error when you cut at the wheelchair the smoke disappears.
I`m new to Ren for which I apologize and I have been catching up watching countless videos. In the last 2 years, I`ve lost 4 close family members, arranged 3 funerals and my mental health is rock bottom, I haven`t put a gun to my head but a noose around my neck - bottled it. I turn to music to get a connection, to get the uplift I need, yes there are people out there worse off than me but I don`t know these people so it doesn`t impact on me. Sorry for that.  The songwriting, the lyrics, the talent of Ren is phenomenal, touching, thought provoking and personal. Thank you
This is a straight masterpice, i love all the money game songs, and the message is loud and clear
I'm just wow evertytime.
Wow beautiful brilliant 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😳😲❤️😻❣️💗 1:12
Man speaks truth. Only a higher power can bring lasting solutions.... Some are "too intellectual" to accept that, though. Too wise...
Wow,the beauty of lirics reminds me Shakespeare.Greetings from Argentina Santa Cruz❤
Ren Got a plan b feel to him 😌
Thank you Ren.
Ren is a genuine artist. I’m blown away by his diversity and his messaging.   Glad to see he is doing well career wise and getting the visibility his talent, drive, and messaging deserves.   Huge respect.  Respect!
🙌🌈 IMMER WIEDER GEIL!!! 🤩
Music and art with a brain. A deadly combination wisely used. Superb.
Can we all just call a spade a spade here?  Ren makes better theatrical releases in both plot, writing, a musical scores than Hollywood has in decades!  Dude, keep doing what you're doing.  In 100 years, people will be talking about Ren as much as we talk about Sinatra in 2024.  Keep up the MARVELOUS work!!!!
This is genius and so brilliantly executed in every single way! 🤯 I'm speechless 😮 👏
I don't really like the hanged people thing , but the song Is a masterpiece
The start is kinda boring but it's good
Just a regular genius  ♥
Im in love with this & you, where have you been! So happy I found your music, you're literally amazing. Cant wait for more!
du drehst kleine geschichten so gut durch dacht so fort empfangbar ich dank dir
The music is terrible but the clip is pretty good.
legends says that after fame of this master piece ren shoot himself with 9x19 caliber because the length is  the same
Motley Crue sang a song about Jimmy the coke dealer too
it's Thomas Shelby?
Facts AMEN 🙏 ❤
Thank you Ren
This is one of the saddest realizations in this vid… At 2:26, Jimmy, the little boy, is reaching out for his toys… he’s playing with his train when his dad hovers over him and discourages nurturing his inner child, nurturing his inner self, and makes him study a book on Business, on how to make material wealth rather than on how to nurtur his spiritual self… makes me think of the profound impact a parent can bring on their children about what is most important in life, and how that sets the trajectory for Jimmy’s life, constantly trying to seek his daddy’s approval as REN puts it, in the wrong ways….   At 4:25 Jimmy turns the globe, and the camera spins along, makes me think of the expression: “Money makes the world go round” … or, Jimmy’s life in a sense will be spinning when he hears the news of his father’s death just seconds later and almost as if foreshadowing, the globe stops…. As if his world stops functioning at that point.   Thereafter, at around 4:40 when Ren raps to the piano, the rhythm is slightly off, slightly discordant… as if Jimmy’s mind has become full of discord, grief and rage    Whether Ren purposefully directed all that or not is irrelevant to me… Ren is a genius either way.
love, love, love
Holy fuck! What did I just watch? Brilliant! 💚💚💚
Bloody speechless❤❤
Just rock n rolla.🎉 Party on.
So true!
This is a masterpiece. Full stop.
Mate I’d love to talk to you about music and things if you ever want to reach out. You’ve become a huge influence to me
You really deserve to be called an artist Your videos are exceptional extraordinary Please tell us more of your stories 🫶
God this guy's voice is awesome
It’s… a masterpiece, there’s no other way to put it. And I mean the combination of 1, 2 and 3 - watch them back to back (the videos not just the audio) and tell me you don’t need to try and remember how to breathe at the end🤐👏🏻
for me the indication of a good artist is how many times he sent shivers on me with his work. With Ren i lost count, GJ man, keep doin it ur way pls
ever since my metalhead days i've been a sucker for anything with keys
Психически неуравновешен, но в целом нормальный=)))))
LUV his videos and the stories told!
Nice song... But such thinking about 'father's will' is just stupid... Many wait pops to die just for his wealth
Ren, thank you
Such a great track
fucking hell dude, awesome
que carajos esto es hermoso sos un god amigo
Let''s gooooo
Can you fight Ohio final boss
🎶💫❤️‍🔥🎹❤️‍🔥💫🎶 Captivating, Enticing, Visually Perfect Vids & Brilliant Artistic Values 🫡
Это очень круто! Талант!!! Продолжайте творить, пожалуйста!
Thank you so much for using your gift for good Ren, Thank you.
Wow!!
Is this the new Eminem??
This is a piece from a master..... A Masterpiece?
What a masterpiece!
This is far from my favorite style, but I have to admit that it's extremely well done and thought - and even have good meaningful message - all things that are very hard to find these days! Good job Ren!
Amazing in all sense of the word
honestly when it started to rain i expected him to sing the "rain rain rain, a storm it comes our way" part of his previous songs but it was a nice feint
1978 penthouse has article about Panama sellout can't send pic but trust me a picture is 1000 words
Is this carter
I have goosebumps from this song. Love you @ren ❤❤❤
🔥🔥🔥
Freaking Brilliant!!!!
This is amazing!!!❤
I did *not* see Rach coming out of this trilogy before I saw it happen. Ren is simply genius. Thank you man. Thank for what you've done and what you're doing.
Stunning talent!!
Never good enough, we all want to be free and have a stable life.
this one left me speechless
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️‍🔥 🎶 es brutal.... En bucle🎶 🪄♾️🤍
Omg the intro is so fucking beautiful.  Dude is there any instrument that doesn't yield to your genius?
SHIVER 🙈🙉🙊
Ren ..man!..you are a very good actor
luigi is now telling me how to gaslight
Great intro, best I've heard. Put a beat to it, and you, my friend, will have a hit. It is the point, the point many strive for.
Te abrazo grande. Larga vida a Ren.
Doing the same as @KnoxHill, this song deserves to be boosted by the algorithm :)
Imma tell my kids this is a musical about Stephen Hawking
Mate just sent me this.  It is absolutely brilliant! ❤
awesome Ren!
What might be obvious shit to some, may have a private meaning to others, be kind
I'm glad you have reactors to capture that "first listen feel". Much love ❤️ Sue
I might be stupid, but I don't understand this part. "45, a fitting number because his age is the same". This is due to "35, he gets a call, I'm sorry, son, but it's your father, had a heart attack". This means his father was 45 years old when Jimmy was aged 35. How old was Jimmy's father when he and Jimmy's mother conceived Jimmy?
GENIUS love it
👏💐
You are what life is but in music. 1 of my favourite lyricist, keep it going. 1 love
Medicine for a sick world
Never fuckin change Ren. Outstanding
My lord.  I just found you yesterday.  But i am blown away by how talented you are.  Your ability to tell a story while rhyming and grab your listeners and hold them close while you take them on a ride is impeccable.  Music with a purpose is hard to come by. Especially this good.  You are one of kind
❤
i have never seen someone who looks so much exactly like what I expected they would. Its wild.
Hey Ren, I must apologize. Not sure how this effects you account, I don't know shit about youtube algorithms. But I find myself on other people's channels because I love their reaction to you. You are a fucking modern day Shakespeare and it's great watching fellow Renagades reacting to you. That being said I'm sorry and I'll concentrate on your channel more often. Cheers.
This is my first Ren song I ever heard/watched the music video of. October 2023 was when I discovered him. The way he tells a story and brings us face to face with the tragic reality of society and life.. the incredible way he plays the piano notes that in ANY other song would clash.. notes that would easily make you say "why would anyone put these keys together??"...but we all know that Ren has that way of being an amazing composer where he can take something that otherwise wouldn't sound good and turn it into a masterpiece! If I could honestly learn the piano for any song in the world, it would be this song. As a piano player, I've looked at and listened to the piano part of this song. I will never be able to play the whole thing. From the instrumental parts of his songs to the way he manipulates his voice, and every little detail is matched and timed perfectly to flow with the story and general flow of his songs. And don't even get me STARTED on this music video and how well done that was! It's flawless. Beautiful. Ren is easily the most artistic and most talented artist I know of because of the pure fact that he succeeds in so many categories. You can't convince me that this song isn't one of the greatest compositions of all time!!
You write from the soul, and it shows
Wow
Love your talent and message, so unique and relatable. Keep on creating and don't let fame n fortune corrupt your beautiful soul. I cry when I listen to you, in all emotions. 😢😮😂😅 fantastic 👏 thankyou for sharing your gift with all of us. Wow ren wow xx always forever a fan Sam x❤
Try to be a little bit more like ren in your soul & heart and the world will healing ❤
Holy. Shit. This was incredible
This man's songs are incredible
Ren your music is something so very fucking special to us. Thank you so so so so fucking much for all the healing and guidance in your music. We are an OSDD-1b system, struggling with psychosis, but functioning enough to make music because we lose ourselves in it. Gives us a moment away from the decay of every day. It helps us release everything that needs to be unleashed too. Not only are your stories a lesson, watching your tiktoks made us feel like we had a friend named ren in our alienation by every nation.  Thank you, Ren. You are the new friend in our head. <3
Idk but I think he's talking about capitalism and suicide 🤔
I need ren In movies he's a brilliant actor as well!
Your Talent and creativity is off the chain
Fuckin TIGHT MATE!!!!!!!
Just seeing many older musos commenting and loving Ren shows the widespread appeal of his art. And this truly is art, in every sense of the word. T(59)
Madness …. U know it like i 💔🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫
This is so powerful! Ren makes me pay attention.
I've been watching this guy for a year or so and I genuinely do think he is very talented and actually hope he goes far i really do
❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤
@AileenSenpai got me here
Your music is pure magic. I feel notes from so many different sources, it’s amazing to see how you blend it all together. Pink Floyd talent. Like a play and a song wrapped together.
My Cocker Spaniel howls  with you @1:39  This is the only time I have seen him howl from any music video he has watched in his 1 year on this planet.
Is that song about John McCafee 😮
5 months later, 9mins 20 seconds just like hi ren. Just  picking that up. 😶‍🌫️
I am speechless....
This dude's dad sucks
MG3 or Jimmy’s Tale. I hope we’ll get a Jimmy toy to add to the Reniverse
Okay… but why is this NOT just a song but a story…
dude dark
Wow, I have no words. This is truly the pinnacle of art. I am glad to have experienced it. Thank you.
At least you spent that money making a great video 😅... 💯💎
I’m shaken.
Qui a composé le cover piano ? C'est REN ? Il sait aussi jouer du piano à ce niveau ?
Ooof!! I've only just decided to dive into your stuff Ren and this clip was amazing! So good!
Ren this is a masterpiece !! But we’ve had jenny screech and violets tale we need Patrick Richard and  Stevies tale !!
simply wow
This is a masterpiece!
Please, please, PLEASE, keep going writing songs and masterpieces like that one. It helps me a lot dealing with my traumas, it's a pleasure to hear and re-hear your songs on the dark-scary nights.  Don't ever suicide, please, please, PLEASE. 🙏🏼 You are an inspiration for my own music.  From France with love, Joseph.
Wow wow a modern day clockwork orange ,This man is a genius. This is art at its best  His storytelling is mind-blowing  Grammy oscar .Give this man the lot Amazing artist
2:12 roughest Harpua ever
this is the best song i have ever heard, you made something so beautiful, i have never experienced anything like it, from the way you had the background music playing and the way you were not as much singing as telling a story it was amazing in every sense of the word, there is no way you can make another song this good. all in all 10 out of 10
wow amazing
Giving a speech on Hyperpolarization tomorrow. Thanks for the inspiration!
Brahhhhhh spectacular
So much heart. Thank you.
Leaving a comment for the algorithm. This is a MASTERPIECE!!
"Jimmy" was born into a rich family + had dad (probably narcissistic) who basically said "nothing is enough".
@blackpegasus com on bro!! 😮
God, his music is really good  ❤
I havent had this emotion since id seen the footage of Lin Miranda at the White House! Cant wait to see where this goes :) You're amazing!
💔
You are an amazing and talented guy and you make feel me hopeful.
waitin an that 4
every message important but this the most...the richer get richer the poor get the picture and nobody wins. Ren just cant outdo himself as evry song i have had the plaesure tomlisten to blos my mind...where to whats next his journey our journey...hope he finds peace love and happiness...and that humans now will be more aware of our fragile existence...long live Ren 👑🐱👑
Ren, your hands are the hands of an artist. I know that probably sounds weird. I was a tattooist. We notice things like artists' hands. I'm so glad that you found your talent and that you share your art with us all.
Genius. Thank you for using your voice, to represent all those who are silenced by themselves.
A true modern day Bard i love it
This guy. Brilliant.  Story telling , the message.  Love it
The world needs more people like you. The voice of sanity in this otherwise cacophony of caterwauling manifestations of greed. Best thing to happen to me this year, I found your music. I wish you nothing but happiness and success as you define it.
What a discovery. This guy is a true artist. This is what the world needs.
U r a hope for the music industry
@RenMakesMusic you've pretty much nailed reality spot on. I'm a long time student of music, though I'm not a musician, and admire the tenacity it takes when an individual has such a grasp of everything going on and be able to speak of it through song. And I think you're a bit off on your assertion that this song isn't entertainment, rather, I look at it as TRUE edutainment. I had already figured out that most everything I was ever taught by the system is a lie long before encountering your masterpiece works of art. Now I have another form of conveyance to pass along with the rest of my red-pill knowledge to those with eyes to see and ears to hear how the system is being played against them.
Got to love ren
chilling
Old Soul Old Soul ...Bravo !
Hunger of the Power ...the worst ilness ....
Keep coming back.  Glorious.  On my Staylist.  Ren and his crew are Amazing.
These songs have helped me to feel heard, and hopefully millions of others, as well. Everything feels hopeless right now and sometimes it can feel like the only solution is to fkn end it, no matter how low or high on the ladder you are. What we're doing is parasitic and self destructive. These song help me to realize I'm not alone in this fight; I'm not the only one trying to demand better from our societies, even though the message just seems to fall on deaf ears.
Cftr
What. A. Work of art! (From human being to human being: I just saw your video of ten years ago, then this… What we all would've missed without you! Thanks to not surrender, man. Powerful experience.)
I love you Ren.   U never disappoint us with your music.   ❤
bro your so nasty makes me sick, happy for you on your success, bout time been a fan long time..
Literally got tears in my eyes ngl
This blew my fucking mind den you are now one of my new favorite artist I have few thank you for your music it’s beautiful makes me cry it’s fucking beautiful what a wonderful guy you are to create something like this. Thank you ren I love your music

I love your work man! incredible!
What. Da. Fuck.
Awww, he started to learn guitar for her.
waou ! still impressive to watch this video made in only 1camera shot !! You're great Ren !
This music is being monster at the end 👹
The story you share, is something truly amazing
I didn't know Cillian Murphy rapped
♥
There are two words that work together to describe ren’s music: Holy shit
Thank you ren
I have seen decades of promo films/pop videos, this is a true example of genius, the ideas the camera blocking are all superb. The words, delivery, live playing are all mind blowing, in such a power full way. Total and utter respect. Thank you, and stay independent, keep observing and tearing up our sick ways, and how we are slaves, high or low to MONEY.
Really powerful and so true to the twisted world of today. Thank youi for this ❤‍🩹
Maybe this will be the day u bless me with a like on my comment!! I kno yr busy!! We used to call energy radio in Hamilton Ontario it was the top eight and eight. We got to announce songs and I'm pretty sure hate Me now by Nas was like number three at the time so this brings back some memories. I really don't know how you're so amazing so talented not to mention super hot. Your music got me through a lot and I look forward to more and more you are my absolute favorite fave. It was always Tyler Joseph for me but damn u took his place for talent and creative abilities. Sorry Tyler. Ren I can't even explain  how great it's been since I discovered u.
Absolutely Brilliant 💯
That final line actually gave me chills.

Awesome strange music 🎼 but I hear the talent ❤peaky blinders the musical
This song was so good our english teacher decided to play it for us today!
Brought here by luigi. Stayed for the great tunes
Ren, Ren, again and again Goes into the night, shines so bright Through the darkness and the mess From the quest returns with Zen for the rest Standing as a beacon in the night A guide, a model for us all to find and share our light.
🔥
Wish the orchestra lasted longer. That was perfection!
Awesome story.  If we could only figure out how to take the world back to something more egalitarian. 🥺
when I realised that he would say "trigger of the money game" it felt like hearing avengers assemble or something
Dayyyyyuuuummmmnn
This video.....is a always  a masterpiece.......again, again❤❤
❤❤❤¥=¥=)=>£€$🎉AMEN ❤❤❤
Incredible
This is amazing!
At the end you don't hear a shot. Maybe he was cheated when the gun and ammunition were sold to him, so he got junk for money and in the end he can't even kill himself. So he would have to suffer even longer.
❤‼️🎵🎶🎼🎤🎹🤟
Великолепен!  Поздрави!
South african Greek 45yr old. Love your creative voice. Your story telling. Your style.  Awesomeness
the whole album is a fresh breeze in the rap industry
Awesome...
wow!
I learnd about this song when i was 13 yr old on a minecraft vid part 1 sea shels
damn..
TALENT
❤❤❤AMEN FEAL MEN LOVE PEACE AND RESPECT ❤❤❤...
Ren! We are a trading nation. Do what you've got to do. Nothing is forever it just feels like it.
Amazing video. Like 21st take :)
Art at it's finest
This is a masterpiece! Unfortunately very ture . Keep up this amazing other wortldy art!🖤
Brilliant
Woah😮
this song is a masterpiece it should be studied in schools...
It's interesting to say the least but it doesn't have the kick from the second part. But nice to finally put a face to the rhymes.
Sands undertale
I bought the record fucking love it ❤
I am so glad that i find you.Thank you for the lyrics & keep ur head&❤ up...!
Holy shit
Musician, artist, poet & prophet. Another masterpiece.
This is an absolute masterpiece, 1 and 2 are great ofc, but this is all time top 5 of all time.
Genius
Algorithum yo
why are you not the next Jamie T???? you make me think
part 3...
I think this is probably one of the best music videos I've ever seen, let alone the SONG. People can say Pt 2 is better but this gets the point across like a bullet. Thank you, Ren, you clearly get it.
BTW -- Ren's other brilliance, like Hitchcock, is creating uncomfortableness in silence. F's with our flight or fight neanderthal brain... :)
well well well. i have nothing to troll here. well done
So original ❤
This “money game” set has been nothing short of brilliant.
Did I miss it or has anyone caught Ren conducting the strings to start the line right as he starts singing in to the mirror? Right hand finishing the timing of it. Love the realness of what I can only assume maybe wasn't caught in post. Maybe it was and Ron loved it and kept it.  That's what I'm guessing.
Sounds like my life in the dear future
Instant classic.
Em'n'Ren or Ren'n'Em when's that happenin?

In case you missed it: January 2024 - International Music Video Awards - Winner of Best Music Video & Best Director Music Video Congratulations to Ren and Samuel for your awesome achievements.
We sold our souls by our tacit agreements with Money.. All we have to do is walk away from this Global Monopoly Game and it's over.. but alas, We Love Money and We can't agree on the color of $hit.
A man after my own Heart, much Love son
Masterpiece. Bravo!
The mony...
Strokes of genius.
Wow
Remember this?
Quite a problem listening to Ren...there just arent any favorites.  Just a massive body of excellence. All I can do is lean and at the moment I'm leaning towards MG part 1 and Sick boi and 74/message in a bottle. That is just me at this moment...Love the interviews too Ren. We gotta kill ourselves if we want to kill the system.
I don't even know what to say, just holy fuck
Pink Floyd of this era ! Absolutely fucking brilliant 🖤
Absolutely incredible! I love everything he’s done!
our man dresses up well.  He'd have my vote
Damn, I want a whole song with you just ohhhhhhh ing.
i feel like this is one of the few 5 minute songs that doesn’t really meander around and uses its time effectively because of that it feels a lot quicker than 5 minutes
Its time to learn about capitalism again
This is art.
Part one is a battle of jimmy with his inner self, swallowing his morals and burning away the good side of himself. Part two is jimmy reminiscing, sitting paralyzed and realizing his wrongdoings. Part three is a suicide note, one of warning as jimmy re-lives his life of pain and suffering. Or at least, that how i see it
Your above and below is so transparent, but you beter stay and go above!
Speechless
Amazing.  Very well done.  You re young yet speak of so much living.   Wow. U must have a hard time making your brain sleep at night.     I m now a fan.
30 steps up from Money Game Pt. 1 & 2. Fucking beautiful.
Ren, I'm physically incapable of calling this _thing_ a song. Because it would be such a big understatement that it feels like lying. For me, your productions usually fall between being a song and an entire experience and THIS is definitely in the second category. It feels like watching an ending to a musical movie and if you ever wanted to make one I'm sure lots of people would pay to watch it, including me. Hope your doing good, whenever you'll read it <3
Lyrics deep bro
Money is a weapon. And a powerful one at that.
Just "wow" man. LV it.
I love all the money game songs
Told a better story in 10 minutes than most movies with 2 hours
Ouch
To sell your soul and this is what you get…
all the pop songs with zero meaning get hundreds of millions of views while masterpieces like this only get a fraction of the attention I swear man, there could be a whole money game about how true talent doesn't get recognized
This guy knows how to tell stories
😲
Where to find the damn lyrics man
"If you manipulate the data, a lie will sell itself" is the most genius thing I've heard in a song so far, it perfectly describes the current situation we're in  Edit: in a song
❤❤❤
A master piece.
It's exactly how western society is going at the moment absolute free fall we're in decline that's for sure we'll done ren story told perfectly.
Oppenheimer... that You??? 🤷🏻‍♂️
I am blown away more and more with each and every Ren/Samuel video I watch. Just unbelievable, captivating, both of you are legends in the making and I can't wait to see what you do in future.
Wow.... like absolutely wow this is a masterpiece 👏
MASTERPIECE ❤
That's a masterpiece,  ren u never disappoint
Still 5M? Just why? What else do you need?
Jesus loves you all.
Magritte reference had me visually hooked in immediately. I was sent a link of Hi Ren last night, so far I've listened to 3 creations, songs is not an adequate description. Genuinely astounding, I'm in awe. Age 62, size 6 shoes,  Australia. ❤
This gives me a decade
The piano. The lyrics. The video. Masterpiece. Reward from the heavens ✨️

Simply an work of art
Wow. Thank you for your Work!
Ren, I'm a 58 year old American. Discovered you about a year ago when Hi Ren came out and have been eating up everything I can by you since. Downloaded your music from Apple Music. Watched your videos. Watch reactions to your videos too. lol. You are an incredible talent. Keep up the amazing work and don't let fame diminish who you are and the messages you want to tell people.
Greatest song message ever.
Free Thom B. Elliott
Bro's talkin' like he read protestant ethic on the spirit of capitalism.
Just to push! Well showed Ren!
I wanted to write a comment describing how I felt repeating this song for the third time in a row and I was at a loss of words because it's so ineffable to be described nevertheless judged by my or anyone's standards. I felt the same listening to each song of yours Ren, and I feel and get hit by each word deep down because I too have my fair deal of mental shit and psychosis. I've accepted myself and loved myself and gone beyond everybody's expectations of me. As you said in your song ''HI Ren'', there are people who appreciate your ART, and its not for anyone It is only for the few.. not commercials that s what makes it extraterrestrial, and unique.. keep going and never succumb to the demons. humans will know how great you are one day.. and your ART shall be treasured for the treasure it is... from an artist to another you will soar even higher.
Wow❤
I’ve never listened to any full 9 minute song, in my entire life…until now. I’ve listened to every song, all the way through, and caught myself wishing it didn’t end.
I can’t stop. Have to comment on every video. Really? You’re not shocked every time? Dude is nuts!!!
Ren gotta be biggie or 2pac
I've made it to 46, everyone thought I'd "check out" long ago. Keep fightin!
Why has this man not come up??? This has changed my playlist forever
oh wow
The song ends at 9:11 ;(
I am 40 and broken
Dude! I’m speechless.
Thomas Shelby singing
I think i’ve just get after 100 views that the bag and the rope at the beginning was a symbol for birth. So it mean that the piano start was during pregnancy
Oooooo didn’t know this was out
Congrats on hitting the 5 million milestone- here’s to millions more 🥰
amazing! pushing boundaries on this art form
😭💜🥺🙌🏻🥰🧿
You are incredible! Thank you for your courageous, confident, soul-filled, expressive creations of unique genius. Bravo 🎉
I hope one day you come to America and play cause my husband & I love your music and the meaning behind it!!
"Lamborghini for a life" definitely needs putting on a t shirt!
perfect .......
❤
Ren, U are a big genius..
Everyone involved in this creation should be forever proud
Thank you Ren for putting that into words for me, I totally agree and have done for over 20 years just haven’t been able to convince the family, actually they are the black sheep! 48yr old fem from NZ
That piano sounds so familiar but I can’t place it. Especially the part at age 23. Does anyone know where that’s from? Or what it sounds similar to?
wow speechless.
I know what it looks like after the video goes dark except it wasn’t Jimmy his name was Michael, everyone called him Boat Man. I was mostly invisible back then just a small lost girl 5th maybe 6th grade. The bullet went through his head and over mine into the cabinet above me. The bar stool fell and blood surrounded the floor I stepped backwards to keep it off my feet. It’s just as vivid in my memory as the night it happened. It was April Fools day that day. Boat made eye contact with me when he held the gun to his head and he said April fools when he pulled the trigger. The whole thing seems like slow motion but I know it wasn’t.
💜💛🖤💚❤️💜
i don't mean to be a pedant but i don't think it's very cool to make a child make a bag on their head for up to 9 minutes at a time
Fucking amazing!
Man you are an artist with a capital A.
My respects to the king of Music!
peak
This song is such an amazing contribution to the world. Thank you!
Damn Ren, glad you're here to serve.
LOVE IT!  REN you are the most amazing artist I've ever come across!
Dear REN,  I extend my sincere gratitude to you. Your storytelling prowess is truly original, marked by phenomenal talent and an honest artistic eye. It evokes a reminiscent feeling of 'Outlaw-Country,' akin to the legendary Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, etc. Thank you for adding a meaningful touch to my life.  With heartfelt appreciation, - maf
“Then he presses on the trigger of the money game” such a hard line   09:04
Living a coment for the algorithm
This is the most beautiful art I've ever seen ❤❤ story telling on another level
I am speechless
💚
i hate the fact that the spotify version is missing a part of the first piano part
Pure genius!
There’s one cut I think it’s just really smooth
why is this not a James Bond song it's  all i see when i listen to this TEEN BOND 0014 AND A HALF
Jimmy your done
Dude, this Ren is like fucking Shakespeare, but he can also rap and play instruments!
Quel génie !!👌👌👏👏
Crazy... Thats the actual music of actual time... Was waiting for it.
I didn't think I would come across one would be just as amazing as high ren but here we are. Vary beautiful and insightful.  ❤
Brilliant
My guy, this is talent. Blessing the current music situation with true talent thank you.
This "Money Game" Series is completely, from its start to now, a total masterpiece.
Thank you.
Hunter?
Standing ovat(ion) Mate 👏👏👏✌️
Such art Such REAL heART Ren ❤
Every emotion just blew my mind...again.
WOOWWW
FUUUUUCK  I could have had fucking everything In the Bleak Mid-Winter C'mon Lads, let's get it done
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Thought it was shit tbh!
This is art... art at its finest. In words I cannot describe, Even if you're like little Johnny.
The sequel I needed
Ren are you trying to tell us you're an anarchist??
I applaud your music talents, but I truly think you're a great story teller, and performer. I would love to see this as a modern day opera. You could add The Tale of Jenny and Screech, and Violet's Tale. I feel like older forms of entertainment should be brought back. Doing something like this in an old school opera house would be epic.
I'm so Excited ! To see ,my Birthday 🥳🎂❤.
Brilliant,love it !!!
United, we stand! Separated, we fall!
legend
Holy shit
Came here from tiktok, I was not disappointed.... WOW
A significant member!
woah...just woah...
Ren is a genius
A piece of art... congrats =)
I love it, you make masterpieces.
This still gets me everytime , absolute masterpiece ❤
Lyrics:  Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy One years old and his first words were mine, mine gimme Two years old, he was walking, three years old, walking quickly Four years old, he was running around the pavements of his city Five years old, and his daddy told him, listen here son, you've got to learn to be a man A man he works for what he wants Six years old, and he's reading, writing, top of the bunch And when he's seven, his progression made him student number one Eight years old and he's praised for unusual grades Nine, his parents pay for private school to nurture the flame 10, 11, 12, 13, he ascends and ascends, his daddy tells him, son, money is the means to all ends 14 solving complex mathematic equations, at 15, IQ 150, still elevating 16 he develops complex software code that detects weaknesses in cyber security protocol  17, and he sells his vision, keeping the share, not yet an adult But he's practically a millionaire 18, and his daddy tells him now you're a man the world don't give a damn about you So take all that you can 19, he turns a profit, stocks and shares, invest in product 20, double down deposits 21, his income rockets 22, he learns that truth is just an obstacle to wealth If you manipulate the data, then the lie will sell itself 23, a life of luxury Crystal and cocaine 24, he makes the Forbes list, they're applauding his name 25, and his daddy told him, listen here, son, while you're sitting in the palace That don't mean that you won 26, his business shifts, he switches business to arms He's 27, dealing nuclear shells in Iran 28, inside the Senate, money bought him a seat He's 29, role of counsel in the president suite And now he's 30, his daddy says, you're losing the race You're just a servant to the king, not even in second place 31, a big maneuver for his daddy's approval Moving imports over borders from the exports out of Cuba 32, moving grams, growing kilo to tons He's 33, filling warehouses with powder and guns 34, turf war with nobody to stop it, blind eye from the Po po inside of his pocket  35, he gets a call, I'm sorry, son, but it's your father, had a heart attack I'm sorry, he's gone, 36, getting pissed off abusing this product 37, eyes glazed, disposition demonic 38, with a prostitute, a moment of passion Heating up the silver spoon and then chasing the dragon 39, getting reckless and hungry for power Daddy's words still driving him to kill him and devour He makes a move against the cartel, but the strategy's flawed They retaliate and leave him in the hospital ward A bullet buried in his vertebra, and one in his leg The doctor sighs and says, I don't think you'll be walking again, fuck  Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy He was 40 and he cursed the words mine, mine gimme 41, he wasn't walking, 42, not walking quickly, 43 Never running round the pavements of his city 44 inside a palace with a mountain of gold But those riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves Weighing heavy on his conscience is the value of gold, Lamborghini for a life Trading money for souls, Jimmy followed the code inside the land of the free Put your hand inside the cookie jar, take more than you need And his example is exaggerated versions of me, and it's a version of him And it's a version of she, and it's a version of you There's no escaping the blame, the way we live, it's parasitic Fuck the money and fame, cut the music  This isn't entertainment, this is real life, the way we live is lunacy, community it declines We're hyperpolarized, we're always fighting and we divide Truth is less important than the money that we designed? Money's an invention, politics from our invention, they all come from people's ideas Did I mention, border's an invention Law and order fuels the tension that leads to people killing each other My solution? Everything is subject to change We could build utopias if individuals were taught to use their brains But if we teach kids in schools to always be sheep and put themselves before the herd If there's more money for meat Then there's no future I see where the humans survive We're parasites inside the Petri dish, with cannibal mines Mold will grow upon the surface, then consumes 'til it dies And our fate could be the same without this story to the wise 45, Jimmy comes home out of the rain, soaking wet upon a wheelchair Drinking again, he has everything he wants, he has fortune and fame Such a fortunate fool with an unfortunate fate with a 45 caliber aimed at his brain 45, a fitting number because his age is the same Here's the words of his father, it's such a damn shame Then he presses on the trigger of a money game
Yo I wonder if these stories are true or fabricated… it sounds eerily truthful in a sense…
Art died in the late 80's, or so it would seem. Rising from the ashes of the 90's, Artistry has been reborn.
Love ren!
Ren you have made my life completely understandable 🧚‍♀️
Such a great piece of musical art. ❤
This is awesome! Ren is an amazing lyricist, poet and musician. I love how his songs tell a story and this one has such a strong message.  He’s one talented man
You ate BRILLIANT!🎉
i Fickin luv you Ren! Right on! Pump it up RIGHT!
@ren these vignettes are the perfect vehicle for you.  Cheers
🔥
До мурашек!!!)) спасибо!!))
Ren is incredible
Respect❣❣❣
Now I’m getting right to the very heart of my soul….. this is super amazing beyond music, and very personally who I am. The human beauty that is in us all even in the darkest moments… This record is actually about what happened on Christmas Eve 1914 in the 1st world war.. Just imagine the trust faith & bravery of the 1st persons that stood up and approached each other, knowing there was probably hundreds of guns  aimed at them, they ignored the orders from the generals who were using them like a game off chess for fun, the guys in the trenches banded together that day and showed what is posible❤️🫶🏼🙏  The bravery of just being human & not a sheep for 1 day is astoundingly off the friggin scale. Now please if you see this message from me ren…. This is the bench mark. You smashed everything out of the park & universe. Thank you See what you can do to address the history that might have taught us to aspire to save our souls & our pangaea by being a collective entity not controlled by the 4% who don’t give a dam❤ it’s our last shot…  I cry to this soo much with every emotion❤️ Love you my alien❤ Click the link below.  https://youtu.be/nh3ft-CLfQ0?si=7jEgkVARyDfYsVPP
❤
Just amazing! Everything you do is. Love it don’t stop!
We’re on the way to making this one of the most popular ten songs, just as it should. It may not be any EDM or anything I would be interested in but it still intrigues me with the structure and the classical melodies and the our genius that ren brings. We will need a fourth one to end the series one that will combine all the songs together❤❤. LONG LIVE REN!!!!
sick
Ren - when is the full length film or stage? rap opera coming? You are a musical, lyrical genius, mate. ❤
I'm blown away by your music Ren.  You aren't the next anyone; you're the first Ren.
Beautiful 😮i mean stunning 💯😍 omg 😳🫶🔥🔥🔥i expect nothing less 💯❗❗❗youre complete 🔥 dude super sexy voice 💯
Every single one of these gets better and better. I await Part 4
That THAT... is... give this guy a grammy for fucks sake!
Oh wowwwww. It's different. I just love it. Nice style. 10/10
I feel like I've watched a movie.
nice
Can't believe Tommy Shelby decided to swap his razor blades for a microphone and start a music career
I leaving a few nuggets around the you tube world for you to find brother.. I get you more than you will ever know bro. ❤ Apart from your amazing talent and trials, the thing that propels you to the heights you won’t ever accept is your complete servility… Question I have is, how did you escape from that cave around Easter 33AD..
is it me or is the last sound of the gun wrong?    he cocked the Gun before while singing,    aimed at his head,  and "pulled the trigger"  but to me it was the sound of cocking again
Masterpiece!!!
and yes thank you Ren you inspire me to be strong
amazing. truth. got it. speaking it. spreading it. I was literally just saying last night, before I heard this song, about another Ren song, that it isn't entertainment. He is speaking from the center of the eternal dance.
Wow.  Amazing.
This is Shakespear.
We all will leave an empire of dirt.
sheet music please 🥲
suggestion on the Samuel & Ren Video Production name. Consider, SICK BOI Productions
Love it
You are a genius and the people helping you make these videos hard. Geniuses !
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! WOW!!!❤❤❤
my favorite
This is the Ren-volution 🎉
Ren: your work is the first time in a life of service to the arts I have encountered a musician's recorded and presented works and found myself wondering "Okay, but is this *just* music?" You have taken the music video and the possibilities presented by online video distribution and fucking elevated an art form with your talent. Thank you.
art. no more to say
Ik ive said it before but i TRULY love your story telling using music.   Cant wait til the next Story Ren! Keep up the good work!
@knoxhill I leave comments for the gems. Beautiful song Ren
REN! this makes me sad, you are so true!
Me never comment but this is so outstanding good that I have to
Lyrics, and so much truth
I don’t even have the words to express how this makes me feel! Don’t ever stop!
Damn bro….
So, I was busy. Then I checked in on Ren and this happened.   Dayum.
Love the part- how money takes way much more importance and priority over people. Money is more important than peoples lives. Brilliant. Genius.
It's unfortunate that this is reality. The rich stay rich and the poor stay poor. Money certainly doesn't bring happiness - especially when in the perspective of the greedy. But if you can apply a poor man's perspective to the money and fame, you get perfection in the wealth that is all ready to be gained. Wealth can mean many things, not just money. It all falls down to balance.
I wish wish wish it just had 1 distant line of the “rain rain rain a storm it comes out way” verse from the other songs at 9:06
This is Ren's world and we are just living in it
Loved it,thanks again Ren,so real so true. I'm so glad you write about the very things views hidden by the world, you keep changing the norm Ren it's the norm that drives us insane x
The man literally sings about the whole life of jimmy till calibre.
my first time listening to this guy but should i just say this is incredible
genuinely an amazing song i feel the effort and soul in this
wow! This left me speechless a true work of art.
A comment that will never been seen in this huge mass, but... Thank you to not have put the big bang from the gun at the end. It's a little things, but it would have made me jump out my chair and skinn so much. I don't like big noises, and the emotional intensity in addition of that... Urgh. Great work, thank you a lot for it. Thank you for your words, explanation and making us feel things
Spamming ads where people taps 5 seconds out isn't going to get you that ad revenue. Christ sake. We just want our CRK rewards
6.00 I would love to hear this orchestral as a full song, thoughts?
He plays piano too????😮
Damn i like Rens music... not all but definitely most. Go Ren tell them what they need to know
Ren, You are True and Laud Voice of many people who stay and will stay silent.  We want to be good, we add the good philosophy of our stupid  wanted. We all are in stupid system of money. We had  to must and we had to have. We  have no humility, we don't have the courage to be  Clean  Human Beeing.  Fortunately there are people like Ren, who expose and stigmatise the truth.  Ren , Man You are Great🥹🍀💚
You zelll the zpeK.😊😊
Would love for to play our 27th  anniversary. 2.22.24.
Dunno if you will see this but ren my boi, there's something very special about you, you seem like family, just like I don't let the beasts inside destroy you and rob the world of a great artist :3 one day we will be ok one day we will be on top till then use the pain as fuel, you lose when you die every day your alive your winning :) keep strong you have people who understand people who care even if you don't know me, you recognise pain when you see it, and sometimes just takes someone going through the same shit to say keep going I understand and I'm here, to keep you going :3
Just brilliant 🥳
I love you man
Had this on repeat for days 🔥🔥🔥💙💙💙🎶🎶🎶💯💯💯
The JWT 🔭 is pointing in the wrong direction 🤔  🌎… Brighton to be specific..  👽 👼  Not fooling us mere mortals that have eyes & ears boy ❤ 🙏🙏🙏🫶🏼
niiiiiice...  Money cannot fix everything, but like the character not everyone thinks nor calculates every decision to act, the actual act of and the expected or actual result of said decision until it is too late in this - he achieved so much but now can no longer dance with or perhaps his favorite hobby no longer...  Ohh, no he didn't -- yes, I have to - no... Yup!   He SUPERMAN'd IT....  He pulled a REEVE...  Well, that's better than pulling a BONO...  Hey! Hey, what?  Watch out for that TREE...
Social Media is drowning in get rich gurus, but riches are worthless without character. Thank You for saying something so  important, so eloquently.

Ren, they have me shut down in psyche ward, i didnt get a chance to view the Linnaeus Encyclopedia. Theyve had me under mental health act since 2016, same year as the human trafficking and slavery act, aust host island integration and i have no rights... Ive never been given a diagnosis, just forced to take their debilitating drugs. They dont even follow their own laws. Service bots surround me,.. am trapped, not sure what to do. If you can find out my phone no, we can talk. The info in my head would start ww3. And noone wants that. Cannot say too much in public forums, i have children. I love your stuff dude,..❤
Dat Boi was blindfolded for that piano bit!!!!
Nomero tre...
This.... Hits home, almost unreal how you were able to adress in such details... It's art what you create and portray but the lyrics and video is like a play of how my father through my lifetime on this earth taught me about human system and life as he also ended his life with a gun to his head.. The money game took him, in the end he ran out of options and the strength to still keep on as the truth was to much to bare as the system weakened him, but he taught me so much that I didn't fall in the hiding traps.. Everything you speak of is what I have heard before.. An uncomfortable agonising truth that you unveil.. Am happy not to be the only one, as others sees me as a to much paranoid person.. I relate very  much to your music, first time I ever comment tho.. Honestly to be able to handle this kind of truth shakes me unfathomable to the core like a crippling never ending nightmare, makes me wonder what makes you so brave to publicly display this and how you yourself cope with all of your knowledge without go insane. Keep up on what you do, makes a huge different and hope it also does for your own good ❤️
This was an absolute masterpiece. I have watched it at least 10 times already. I know it’s been out for awhile now- but I just recently discovered you about 5 days ago. Absolutely blown away by your talent.
I WISH THIS VIDEO WILL STOP POPPING UP WHILE I'M TRYING TO PLAY MY GAME ONLINE, AND WHEN YOU TRY TO CLOSE IT BRINGS YOU HERE 😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠 HOW IRRITATING AND FRUSTRATING
Awesome just bit to real
I mean, money IS a means to an end... but that is all. Capitalism isn't parasitic... it is in fact... the ONLY system which isn't parasitic.   But, if all you do is pursue money AS the end... you will never be happy. No matter how much you have or don't have, you won't have enough.   True purpose is finding a mission in life and pursuing that. Whether it is a selfish mission or a giving one, you need a hiring purpose and driving desire towards a goal... and need to constantly set new goals if you achieve what you initially sought out to do.  The fact that we live in a world where you aren't forced to live the life of your parents is a blessing... but also a curse.
For me, this is the most relevant piece of art in the last decade.
The gift that keeps giving. Thanks Ren 😊
Very extremely Talented , great Song
I would like to say that this "song" has been in my music rotation for the past few months, yet calling it a mere "song" would be doing it a disservice. *This is a warning to heed as much as it is an awakening call.*
This was intense!
please TAKE THIS A THE COMPLIMENT IT IS MEANT TO BE ...you sir are the modern day one man pink floyd ...the world needed and needs you my freind...get well soon mate ...Tim...London .U.K
Capitalism fucking sucks
Sad but true
wow..
Incredible work
It is real part, blind eye from the Po po inside of his pocket.
I live in hatred called islam... Make me free
Beautiful
Impresionante como siempre Ren 👏🏼 👏🏼👏🏼
Stunned
I never really got how people were obsessed with a artist and followed everything they did... that was until I saw Hi Ren and went down the Red Rabbit hole
I’m 45
MASTERPIECE
This song would make a great theatre show.
❤😊
9 minutes well spent. this is more of a life lesson than just music, honestly.
A masterpiece. 🤘😎🤘
So glad I found you by complete accident! Absolutely amazing I’m obsessed and I’m only 2 songs in ❤❤❤❤
yo
The storytelling talant is so crazy. Thank you for yet another masterpiece!
⚡️
Algorithm be damned. Promote this masterpiece
Brilliant
❤ Build New Order... from ;)
Just Ren being Mr fucking Selby.
phenomenal
I saw Hi Ren on til Tok awhile back, saw it again and decided to listen to the full song and each consecutive song I listen to of yours impresses me more and more with your lyrical art and productional genius
SPITTS SCOOPS PEBBLES
You are a fucking genius my friend. Every song I listen to gives me chills
Спасибо вам огромное за ваше творчество, слушая вашу музыку душа спокойствие и умиротварение получает, не изменяйте своим идеям во благо коммерции
Dis man has The X Factor , Nah jokes aside but the lyrics are Blazing 🔥 Hot..🎉
Uncomparible talent.
Found out about this man through a random redditor. It is 4 am on a Friday morning and I am more hooked Ren then I was on coke
i see what you did at the end you cheeky bastard EY
Dont know what to say. This is s fucking masterpiece from music to storytelling to flow/singing.
Fucking brilliant.
Absolutely phenomenal!
Ive watched this countless times.  Ive shared it with as many people as i can.  I love the art you are putting out
You sir are juat down right epic
It's a message people.  Understand it, share it, if not we're doomed.
♥️♥️♥️♥️🌞
Performance art at its best!
masterpiece
Genius!
Im not sure why this just popped up on my feed, but i am so glad that I have the opportunity to experience Ren
Never let anyone change you, your art is so special and unique.
The creature from jekyll Island rises up !!!
This song is so fire that I almost want to pay my taxes (I ain't no pawn in the game).
We listened We watched We felt  It moved  In 559 seconds our hearts lept 559 miles towards life, truth and wisdom.  I’ve never experienced such freedom.
Wow! You are so good!!! I'm a fan 💙🤘
Man I love your style story
How do you define this? How do you categorize, label, or identify it? Music, poetry, rap? Story teller, performance artist, priest? I can't. It hits hard. It's the human condition, its truth.
The Message here  is more then people think. Just listen!
I personally will call this "Requiem for a Money Game "
If you manipulate the data, the lie will sell itself. Truth.
i hate this song because it is the truth. ain't that sayin something
MONEY GAME!!!!!!
Came here to leave a message of congratulations as it seemed a fitting place to do so. It dosen't suprise me to find out you and Sam won best music video, at the international music video awards 2024 for this master piece.  Sending you and all who worked on it with you love and respect. From a cold and wet Portsmouth, Uk.
Algorithm
You gave my soul goosebumps. Thank you Ren.
the best artist by millennium.... just i can do ...is talk thanks
Best Peaky Blinders Song ive ever heard! (Ren, this is genius and the video is just sick. Well done lads!)
Learned that Ren plays piano in his live “For Joe” video. There isn’t anyone on his level! Musician, poet, lyricist and visual arts masterminds.
EVERYTHING Ren does is magic. Only through divine connection could such talent exist! We thank you for giving our souls a voice! All love & mad respect! ❤❤️‍🔥🙌🏻🫡
This gave me chills. Ive been listening to REN since money game part 1, so underrated!
7 months ago, one and a half months before my 46th birthday… I put my .45cal, Colt 1911 to my head and pulled the trigger. The round misfired and in my angry blind insanity, I threw the weapon at the floor. When I was distracted, my daughter kicked it under the couch and my wife and brother distracted me enough till I left the house. I came back home to police that handled me at gunpoint in front of my home. I talked crazy business to the officers and they treated me a little roughly. My psychotic lapses can be quite intense and I can be quite abrasive and unpredictable/violent, so I get it.  I was lucky that I got to spend a week in the psych ward, instead of becoming ash that was spread into Lake Michigan.   The message of these three musical pieces are already quite moving, but the ending of part 3 is SOOO powerful and intense for me. And quite honestly… it’s exceedingly rare that a piece of art, moves me in such a genuine and eye opening way. Now… even though I’m not in a wheelchair, I deeply identified with Ren’s character at the end. So much so, that I instantly choked up with tears.  Amazingly moving.  Well done Ren!!! Absolutely stellar work.
finally, the human condition in auditory form
Did anyone ever tell you that you have a haircut like Cillian Murphy in Peaky Blinders ❤ Love it
Amazing song! I loved it as much as the song “Stan”!
Algorithm
Lost track of how many times Iv watched this. Goosebumps every single time though!
Love it already
He doesn't know he is wearing the cloth until he sees the mirror. Then he sees himself and his life in retrospect...didn't like what he saw
Wow...just...wow.
johnnyknox
she sold seashells on the seashore, now I took the advice and I'm a liar, a devil and a whore. thank you ren.
my guy spitting facts and telling a story at the same time
Going into this, I thought, "9 minutes... bit lengthy." I was captivated throughout! Keep it up, Ren 🦾
Don't let the brilliance of his poetry overshadow the power and truth of his message
Love this track.
Boi can play guitar and piano. What’s next?
😮‍💨
If anyone is not on this frequency i suggest reset your brain and acknowledge your energy,water and on a frequency and that frequency can change . ❤❤❤❤❤
Love this❤
Masterpiece from the construction, message, filming, direction, music.
I rarely comment but this man is a genius. Powerful message even more prevalent in today's global situation.
I keep coming back. It's the performance, the storytelling more than anything, that sells this masterpiece. Bravo, sir.
REn really should get into serious acting. He is amazing definitely has the acting chops. The kid just oozes talent.
Ur so amazing ❤ I just love ur music!!!!
I pray you all are well
there  could be several Money Games; middle class, go to school, get good grades, go to college, get a good job, get married, buy a house : mortgage (death pledge). .and don´t learn about the Cestui Que Trust Act of 1666 that´s still active & worldwide. . look behind the curtain
This is amazing
Wow. Phenomenal work!
*luigi meme goes here
absolute genius , love the proggresion from money game 1,2 and 3. The whole message, how it builds up from society , to politics , in higher places and dark places that returns eventually to the main problem. The Family, the education the expample of life that shape us.   Absolutely amazing Ren !  All the love and respect from Romania !!   Don't stop making music !
This is beyond Talent 😳 I watched a few videos of Ren and i didn't quite like them until i found "Money game" : All parts are masterpiece especially this one ! Man this is crazy, the way he delivers such a powerful message is amazing. Never seen such thing before SO shout out to Ren for this mesmerizing performance 😍❤
huuwhoaw
Wow....this guy is a amazing artist
Beautiful
😲
That was cold, gave me literal chills.
I can keep watching this over and over, Brilliant!
Still makes my vibe and cry every time
This is beautiful
This should be shown in schools, it's the most realistic depiction of the state of politics I've ever seen.
This seems to have the wrong message lol just my opinion.
Moral of the story? Don't F with the Cartel.
I genuinely feel this song had meaning. Everyone always thinks I'm crazy cause i have 0 aspirations for greatness all i want is to get by.   They're always angry depressed tired ecetera yet here i an just getting by and loving my life.
Incredible how everyone involved keeps one upping themselves. Probably the closest thing well see to a modern masterpiece. Pt. 4 will probably be a feature length film at this rate.
Well, it is the masterpiece
This is true , artistic genius
Good shit. Tough, but good.
Incredible.
REN is incredible
woah
Wait he can play piano too 😭
I'm just coming back here every now and then to admire this masterpiece
Why is the piano my favorite part lol
It’s ironic that the song is about exploiting greed and I simultaneously want it to hit Hi Ren numbers  People need to see this
Lyrics Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy One years old and his first words were mine, mine gimme Two years old, he was walking, three years old, walking quickly Four years old, he was running around the pavements of his city Five years old, and his daddy told him, listen here son, you've got to learn to be a man A man he works for what he wants Six years old, and he's reading, writing, top of the bunch And when he's seven, his progression made him student number one Eight years old and he's praised for unusual grades Nine, his parents pay for private school to nurture the flame 10, 11, 12, 13, he ascends and ascends, his daddy tells him, son, money is the means to all ends 14 solving complex mathematic equations, at 15, IQ 150, still elevating 16 he develops complex software code that detects weaknesses in cyber security protocol 17, and he sells his vision, keeping the share, not yet an adult But he's practically a millionaire 18, and his daddy tells him now you're a man the world don't give a damn about you So take all that you can 19, he turns a profit, stocks and shares, invest in product 20, double down deposits 21, his income rockets 22, he learns that truth is just an obstacle to wealth If you manipulate the data, then the lie will sell itself 23, a life of luxury Crystal and cocaine 24, he makes the Forbes list, they're applauding his name 25, and his daddy told him, listen here, son, while you're sitting in the palace That don't mean that you won 26, his business shifts, he switches business to arms He's 27, dealing nuclear shells in Iran 28, inside the Senate, money bought him a seat He's 29, role of counsel in the president suite And now he's 30, his daddy says, you're losing the race You're just a servant to the king, not even in second place 31, a big maneuver for his daddy's approval Moving imports over borders from the exports out of Cuba 32, moving grams, growing kilo to tons He's 33, filling warehouses with powder and guns 34, turf war with nobody to stop it, blind eye from the Po po inside of his pocket 35, he gets a call, I'm sorry, son, but it's your father, had a heart attack I'm sorry, he's gone, 36, getting pissed off abusing this product 37, eyes glazed, disposition demonic 38, with a prostitute, a moment of passion Heating up the silver spoon and then chasing the dragon 39, getting reckless and hungry for power Daddy's words still driving him to kill him and devour He makes a move against the cartel, but the strategy's flawed They retaliate and leave him in the hospital ward A bullet buried in his vertebra, and one in his leg The doctor sighs and says, I don't think you'll be walking again, fuck Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy He was 40 and he cursed the words mine, mine gimme 41, he wasn't walking, 42, not walking quickly, 43 Never running round the pavements of his city 44 inside a palace with a mountain of gold But those riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves Weighing heavy on his conscience is the value of gold, Lamborghini for a life Trading money for souls, Jimmy followed the code inside the land of the free Put your hand inside the cookie jar, take more than you need And his example is exaggerated versions of me, and it's a version of him And it's a version of she, and it's a version of you There's no escaping the blame, the way we live, it's parasitic Fuck the money and fame, cut the music This isn't entertainment, this is real life, the way we live is lunacy, community it declines We're hyperpolarized, we're always fighting and we divide Truth is less important than the money that we designed? Money's an invention, politics from our invention, they all come from people's ideas Did I mention, border's an invention Law and order fuels the tension that leads to people killing each other My solution? Everything is subject to change We could build utopias if individuals were taught to use their brains But if we teach kids in schools to always be sheep and put themselves before the herd If there's more money for meat Then there's no future I see where the humans survive We're parasites inside the Petri dish, with cannibal mines Mold will grow upon the surface, then consumes 'til it dies And our fate could be the same without this story to the wise 45, Jimmy comes home out of the rain, soaking wet upon a wheelchair Drinking again, he has everything he wants, he has fortune and fame Such a fortunate fool with an unfortunate fate with a 45 caliber aimed at his brain 45, a fitting number because his age is the same Here's the words of his father, it's such a damn shame Then he presses on the trigger of a money game
I screamed at the end, literally from all it made me feel
This is a Cinematic Masterpiece
How many times am I gonna watch this?  Me: YES
This is truly a masterpiece, between the powerful lyrics and amazing film production.

Damn, why'd youtube not notify me wit this?
How’d you do that?
algoritim give this man more views
You are amazing! Ioooooove you!!!!!
I love how Ren’s music tells a story! I also love that it is raw.
You hear very much life storys... 💔
Magnificent 😢 thank you for reaching out to the world.touching so many! Your pain and sorrow not in vain. Thank you Renn, for your craze not in vain. Saved a bunch of us that relate. We love you....
Ren is a genius
If Ren isn't absolutely loaded within the next year or so then there's no justice left in this world.
A very different follow up than Money Game 2, but I have to say that this is a masterclass. Good on you, Ren
damn
Great!
yes…digging this! Know Some persons like this🤐🤐🤐
………one word………wow
Hauntingly epic , ur so multi talented
Genius!
Wow ! Powerful message !
Money game returneddd
Money game returneddd
Can't turn the volume up loud enough.
This goes far beyond music music. Truly art.
How am I supposed to listen to anyone else now? Crap. lol at least when I’m asked who my favorite band/artist is I won’t have to think about it. Ren will always be my #1!
You were not made to be broken or beat. You were meant to give us a reason to stay. To feel again. To connect at a time when society itself is cold and threatening.   You are now part of our DNA. I know you “shifted” something in me. Something that makes me feel better, feel understood. I’ve never felt that before. Thank you Ren for giving me what I didn’t even know I needed. A sense of peace. xx
Amazing...
FIRE AND FACTS!!!
Sorry, but how does this not have more views?
Another legend in music from UK Respect
Have to say I'm late to ren.  Having spent the last year going through some shit I came across hi ren 2 days ago on tiktok. Reduced me to tears and now I'm I hooked.  What a talent.
Парень просто джиниус
This is art
Du hoo hoo de!!👍
Wow
"This isn't entertainment, this is real life."
Agreed, Masterpiece.
was the start a reference to grieg piano concerto????
@Ren the string quartet is stunning and I believe you  composed this piece too. We're you inspired by the piece "Remember"? It sounds so similar but different of course and is another stunning piece of composition.  I'm a teacher (philosophy & ethics) but I used to teach drama and used the piece to create a piece with my students about the loss of war.  Thank you for sharing ❤
Hell yeah
Anyone else getting Flobots - Handlebars from this?
Im so jelly. I love piano but never had the chance to learn it. Now Im almost 39 years old and its way too late. It makes me so sad
Masterpiece
Nothing makes me feel more connected than Ren, less alone. But this just makes it worse, realising how disconnected we are. I am.
Generational talent. Genius.

It would be really cool is you did a video with Tom MacDonald @RenMakesMusic @TomMacDonaldOfficial
🔥
A perfect damnation of the Capitalistic lives most are pressured to aspire to.   As an Anarchist, I find your retrospective on society to be enlightening in this day and age, especially with the ideology that's been pumped into people's minds, pretty much since, Thatcher.   Kudos to any and all that have resisted the state's indoctrination programming. Oops, I meant education! 😉✊🏼♥️😎🤙🏼🇵🇸
I feel like living true pain and true desperation has given Ren a body to be the voice of that little person in the back of our minds that tells us this is all wrong.   I love the passion. I love the execution. This is musical storytelling taken to the next level. What a masterpiece.
A masterpiece!
☘
I think a roulette gun would have fit better at the end
I have never been accustomed to admiring artists or famous people because most of the time i can not relate deeply to that person or the messages they portray or publicize. Ren has now changed this for me. I am i awe of his talent, authenticity and strength! For someone who has had trouble with mental health herself, due to having trouble understanding how our society is so sick as a human race and wishing i could fix it, but feel powerless, listening to your music makes me feel like I'm not alone or going crazy. I HATE how money is a priority, how certain people are trying to divide us all when at the end of the day no matter what race, colour etc we are, we are all human! We all have the same basic needs which is physiological, safety, love, belonging, esteem and self-actualization! Nothing more, nothing less! That feeling we are all mice running on a constant wheel to no where due to lack of compassion, understanding, empathy, community and a force of evil/toxicity trying to tear us down is heartbreaking for me. Realizing we are all so gifted in our unique way and have so much more to offer than fame, wealth, materialistic items and "perfection" is something i hope for on a daily basis for our next generation. As well as for the kindness of humanity to survive. Sending much love and hope to everyone! I obviously don't know Ren personally but i feel so proud of him! The health problems and mental health issues he has had to endure i don't wish on anyone! But to still keep fighting and never give up and to still be so committed to pursing his purpose and spreading light on whats wrong with the world, but at the same time sending a message on what should be the true focus as human beings.... in my eyes..... it's the hope, change and strength we all need to hear and see, so our light within us doesn't diminish and makes us come back to realization of what really matters. At times it can be hard when we are constantly programmed to think otherwise! Thank you Ren!
I cant even. The amount of time ren must of taken to write bars this hot must of been eons
News flash kid... 1) Theres no possibility for a utopia  nor SHOULD there be. You wouldn't like the people that generates.  2) Learn some handgun basics before using one as a prop for your propaganda. Its clear you're unfamiliar.
Beutiful
It's kind of perverse. You listen to the song, hear the message. Got goosebumps. ...And then Youtube shows you one spot: "how to make 1000 an hour with digital income."
Masterpice
Masterpiece
Ren is the most astonishing performer i have ever seen. Each of his works are Masterpieces, a truly breathtaking  performance combining intense poetry accompanied with virtuoso musicianship. it reminded me of the darkness , the one we walk alone. and the peace that comes when you re enter the light .thank you .
The entire piano scene reminds me so much of Funeral For A Friend <3
#REN for England Prime Minister!!!!  ... I'm only half joking! If Trump can do it 🤣 🤣 🤣   》》》》¿♡¿《《《《  WARNING ⚠️! (* gives direction,  typo fixed and words missed/added. I have brain damage as I died in hospital in august 2016, and it gave me mild brain damage. Also got EDS x2, ADHD, PTSD, EUPD, HCM, OCD etc. with the rest of the alphabet Google medical acronyms, it will help, oh, and that was before I medically died (coughed my spleen up in Aberdeen royal infirmary and bled to death).
Do you think that if he got invited to the Grammys,he would go and if so so you reckon he would wear like the jumpsuit or just casual??? Just curious
art
Comment for the algo-rhythm haha get it cause… its a song… (:
🖤🤍🖤🤍
The way REN shows himself with every word Unkind and beautiful ☯️ It stings my eyes to see the reflection of myself in such beautiful pain 🤌✨🖤🌙🥰☯️
Soul shaker🤌✨🖤🌙🥰
Avid fan brother following everything. I need to ask tho hows yourself i notice people dont ask after lockdown i use chalk lines in the morning two months off meds brother im like you they all say that i only to make the point im giggling saying this you!!!! Know started a youtube channel, or we did my recovery wouldn't exist without you, my friend and Chinchilla, with yah in the morning, wel 3.33 am, god hour, when the streets show magic to those whiling to partake. Do you paint if not bro your an artist at everything ive seen you grow from that back garden step covering songs look at you now FUCKING god status.. god speed 🙏
Holy
Ren, мы тебя дюбим. ❤
Stunning
I feel bad that I've only just discovered Ren these last few days, but by fuck am I glad I have. Genius.
New fan here, slow clap 👏👏👏👏
Did you pay to just copypaste HAMILTON Broadway Musical or...?
Great song and story telling. Passionate and true. Today we see it clearly across the world. Perhaps one day people will wake up and realize we need a new path for humanity. Across history this has been the legacy of the human condition. Keep it up. Your music and story telling strikes a nerve and love how it gets people thinking. Today is important, and being present to the moment instead of focused on the fantasy of a future not yet written can help people to break the cycle of insanity. Then again, perhaps we will never learn. Good luck in all of your aspersions.
I just found your channel and you are a lyrical master and story telling genius.
Genius flowing like magic!!!!
Hi REN if you read this I have a question for you one  you are the best musician next question is do your fingers ever hurt after you play the guitar?
i would say that if Rens music ,was within the Lines of  the Grammy's. This is 100% one of the best masterpiece's made, there is so much story, beat is on point with hes bars and the preformence os legendary.
This is  whole movie - Ren made!
Speechless
For the algorithm. Absolutely lovely.  I don't think I've ever been attracted to someone for so many different reasons. 😅
Just brilliant...
❤✝️♥️
He’s just genius. I’m impressed how complete he is as an artist.
Did he actually shoot?
The world is so corrupt.cause it takes you so long to gain money and fame but what is it all for if you can lose it in seconds.Just by doing a mistake.We make good comments but if I person did a mistake and you disliked it you would put a hate comment
why doesn't this have at least 100 million views, this is the best video I've seen in a very long time. Hope this video gets recommended
OMG dude.... you are just a genius.....
Continuity error with the whiskey bottle... watch closely.
His music has always randomly popped up on my feed ever since I was a child
Please don't stop Ren, Don't stop…
I just watched all 3 of the money vids. Amazing! Just amazing. Respect from a very small town in the middle of nowhere Utah.
masterpiece
Unfreakinreal brother.
Great music, great message, poor trigger control.
I wrote a poem while getting clean and it had a line about a silver spoon being the one used to cook/shoot heroin. It really is such an underrated line lol, fcking love this
This song is me; but I never cared for money. It was all to find out- Why?
A hyme, to the machine gods of the algorithm, we are the brotherhood of man, who raise our temples high, inside our quantum servers full of AI, our artificial gods that lead us to the end of eternity through the sky!
From what I understood, the mic in the end scene is under his ty. There a many ways to find out all the details of this video. The 2hours38 BtS from Wolf Johnson, and concerning the sound of his videos the interview with the charismatic voice, where he explains detailed how he works on the sound in post production. He does it himself.
This is a masterpiece.
Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy One years old and his first words were mine, mine gimme Two years old, he was walking, three years old, walking quickly Four years old, he was running around the pavements of his city Five years old, and his daddy told him, listen here son, you've got to learn to be a man A man he works for what he wants Six years old, and he's reading, writing, top of the bunch And when he's seven, his progression made him student number one Eight years old and he's praised for unusual grades Nine, his parents pay for private school to nurture the flame 10, 11, 12, 13, he ascends and ascends, his daddy tells him, son, money is the means to all ends 14 solving complex mathematic equations, at 15, IQ 150, still elevating 16 he develops complex software code that detects weaknesses in cyber security protocol  17, and he sells his vision, keeping the share, not yet an adult But he's practically a millionaire 18, and his daddy tells him now you're a man the world don't give a damn about you So take all that you can 19, he turns a profit, stocks and shares, invest in product 20, double down deposits 21, his income rockets 22, he learns that truth is just an obstacle to wealth If you manipulate the data, then the lie will sell itself 23, a life of luxury Crystal and cocaine 24, he makes the Forbes list, they're applauding his name 25, and his daddy told him, listen here, son, while you're sitting in the palace That don't mean that you won 26, his business shifts, he switches business to arms He's 27, dealing nuclear shells in Iran 28, inside the Senate, money bought him a seat He's 29, role of counsel in the president suite And now he's 30, his daddy says, you're losing the race You're just a servant to the king, not even in second place 31, a big maneuver for his daddy's approval Moving imports over borders from the exports out of Cuba 32, moving grams, growing kilo to tons He's 33, filling warehouses with powder and guns 34, turf war with nobody to stop it, blind eye from the Po po inside of his pocket  35, he gets a call, I'm sorry, son, but it's your father, had a heart attack I'm sorry, he's gone, 36, getting pissed off abusing this product 37, eyes glazed, disposition demonic 38, with a prostitute, a moment of passion Heating up the silver spoon and then chasing the dragon 39, getting reckless and hungry for power Daddy's words still driving him to kill him and devour He makes a move against the cartel, but the strategy's flawed They retaliate and leave him in the hospital ward A bullet buried in his vertebra, and one in his leg The doctor sighs and says, I don't think you'll be walking again, fuck  Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy He was 40 and he cursed the words mine, mine gimme 41, he wasn't walking, 42, not walking quickly, 43 Never running round the pavements of his city 44 inside a palace with a mountain of gold But those riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves Weighing heavy on his conscience is the value of gold, Lamborghini for a life Trading money for souls, Jimmy followed the code inside the land of the free Put your hand inside the cookie jar, take more than you need And his example is exaggerated versions of me, and it's a version of him And it's a version of she, and it's a version of you There's no escaping the blame, the way we live, it's parasitic Fuck the money and fame, cut the music  This isn't entertainment, this is real life, the way we live is lunacy, community it declines We're hyperpolarized, we're always fighting and we divide Truth is less important than the money that we designed? Money's an invention, politics from our invention, they all come from people's ideas Did I mention, border's an invention Law and order fuels the tension that leads to people killing each other My solution? Everything is subject to change We could build utopias if individuals were taught to use their brains But if we teach kids in schools to always be sheep and put themselves before the herd If there's more money for meat Then there's no future I see where the humans survive We're parasites inside the Petri dish, with cannibal mines Mold will grow upon the surface, then consumes 'til it dies And our fate could be the same without this story to the wise 45, Jimmy comes home out of the rain, soaking wet upon a wheelchair Drinking again, he has everything he wants, he has fortune and fame Such a fortunate fool with an unfortunate fate with a 45 caliber aimed at his brain 45, a fitting number because his age is the same Here's the words of his father, it's such a damn shame Then he presses on the trigger of a money gam
Fake gun or not, loaded or not, please never point the muzzle at anything you aren't willing to destroy. Especially with your finger inside the trigger guard. Please.
Just wanted to say that I found you recently through a Tik Tok reaction video and am absolutely in love with all of your content. You are so bloody talented and I now look forward to seeing all the content you put out.
Ren , you may see this , you may not. I’m proud of how far you’ve come , you’ve got talent! My dad loves you like a brother and he dosent even know you! Your music is stunning, I’m 14 and people think I’m werid for liking your music because they want to fit in with society and listen to drill or any of that crap. Your music is catchy and amazing! My dad listens to you because he can relate to some of your songs , he loves you to bits , keep going for my dad Ren!!
a brilliant piece of music video
Algorithm needs to do its thing
I believe Ren if he says this is live. But where's the microphone in the end scene? It was attached to the jacket... Does anyone know how they did this? I wonder anyway how this can sound so clear with this tiny mic. To filter out all the noises of movement etc and leveling the volume must be a pain in the ass. How is it possible to make this sound like a studio recording?
Yeah, huge congrats for winning the international music video award!!! Noone deserves it more. I didn't think that deep and non commercial music would ever get to the charts again and winning awards. I have hope for the future. There are incredible musicians out there but they don't get any attention...
Congratulations on winning the International Music Video Awards for best music video, best director, and cinematography honorable mention!
So I never heard of you before.  Yesterday I was having pints with my best friend and she recommended me to you. Holy shit you are amazing.
New fan
du bist ein mann theater mit mucke  sehr sehr geil
🇺🇾👑❤️
amazing. this isnt just some rich dude screaming obvious shit like most of the eat-the-rich media. this is an actual criticism of capitalism. just amazing
Masterpiece of music 11/10 ren
Wow
A God ❤
Nice
First thought 3:54 or 234, or am I totally off? 🤔
Unbelievable, we admire you as far as France Ren !
Luigi
This song is seriously A ONCE OF AN ENTIRE SPECIES TYPE OF SONG. there will NEVER be another like it. It's poetry, it's politics, it's corruption, it's acceptance, it's drive, determination, division, it's greed, it's hate, it's propaganda, it's about manipulation and people being set up to be pawns in a system since they were children. Indoctrinated by the same people who told them to trust. It's the world we live in today, the society we have been designed to be. too focused on hating each other and money. not just in the U.S.A or U.K. but all over the world, all of us are dealing with the same problems.  Ren you are a linguistic master. The way you can take a story, add movement, choreography, timing, effects, visuals, audio, plus much much more and fuse it all into one, to become this absolutely beautiful masterpiece, is absolutely mind shattering. ANY OTHER MUSICAL ARTIST of ANY GENRE would have to pay MILLIONS of dollars to produce a video of this quality, let alone the story told in the song, that's millions more by a ghost writer (probably end up being you, because nobody else could do it in my opinion😂) and then you have the record label who has all these resources at their fingertips. Meanwhile here you are, an independent artist, no record label, no massive studio budget, no crazy special effects budget, just a REAL down to earth, honest, kind hearted soul, with the mind and ability to touch millions of minds and souls. This is why I love you and your music brother. there's literally nobody else out there in the WORLD, like you. I hope one day I get to meet you or see you play. it would be a huge honor.
East Tennessee watching
So real❤.
@Ren your music does to me what no other music ever has! WOW! 🥰
Such an incredible piece of art. You are a talent Ren. I’m fucking to stoked to hear what you put out next and next and next and next
Bro made the music that I wish I had the skills to create. This is amazing, man.
phenomenal to put it simply
Ren is genuinely a lyrical genius, this song is a masterpiece and he put it so well.
this is what makes you different from others.  because of this, you already belong to the elite of creation
Sucks
Damn. Been missing a lot of good ones lately. Well, better late than never, I guess. Only word I have for this is masterpiece!
This some deep shit ur the best bro
Thank you for commenting on Harry Mac’s  ‘2024’ vid so I can find you… you & him are actual music artist that tell stores, that’s a rarity now a days
How does he do this every single time I fkn love you REN
Ren… I have no words… just, fuuuckin thank you…. Love you Ren!!!!
Insane, incredible, just wow
Just here for the algorithm....keep it going m8 :)
......he plays piano too?!? Short, but better than i could ever do. Love this dude.
Tommy Shelby with bars
brilliant as usual... how have more people not seen this and your other performances?
THIS IS ART! ❤
This is so underrated
Fucking genius
Ehh not a fan personally but respect
❤
Yes! 100% MASTERPIECE!! This perfectly descriptive song coupled with this glorious infusion of visual content definitely makes this in it's entirety, a masterpiece!
Fucking superb
Love the truth telling
This is amazing
This song is a masterpiece! Ren you are a true artist. Keep speaking the truth lovely soul.  This song, tears rolling down my face. The moments when fear wins those lies become truth. Soul is here quitely waiting to express pure love. Tears for every moment fear won.
That was really strong.
masterpiece
Jimmy  is me
This is a message against capitalism and corruption. If you didnt know, now you do.
Going Peaky Blinders .. sweet!
Happy , Healthy,  Safe New Year 🎉
This is masterpiece!!!!!
this is so much more than just music. Its art, story telling, passion, love, hate, experience, and life.  Ren, please keep pushing forward, don't lose sight of what you care about. We all will be standing here cheering you on.
I love checking out the newest comments on this video! People just keep finding this awesomeness for the first time and Ren still loving the occasional comment (Hi Ren!)
One-upping Pt. 2 is no small feat, but you just blew it out the water. This definitely deserves multilanguage subtitles.  edit: Man, just realised Ren made a point to put the entire credits in the description. Actual, legit class act.
that hit hard
WE FINDING THE 8 PAGES WITH THIS ONE 🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯📈📈📈📈📈📈📈
I love this song so much
Shit. Great!
Ren if your looking for a collaboration take a look at Norman sann the lads quality, chances are you'll just ignore this message but you'll miss a trick lad 😉😉
❤✌
Breathtaking. Literally.
fuck this is too good
Don't sell yourself like this loser. Make something beautiful.
That was amazing holy shit
the piano always carries its own story of survival
CAN ME HAVE SUM powder !!!
I still love listening/watching this piece of art from the mind and talent of a most amazing man.
best thing like ever
💜💜💜💜💜
#WestCoastWizard Fantastic
This has a definite Harrison Bergeron vibe towards the end...
Only was to tell people without getting hurt, is writing hidden meanings in songs ,hes probably been gaslighted seen the incest pedophile stuff ,and how women are too scared to say anything thinking it protects their children wrong sometimes its best to not care as much so you can tell people the truth even if you die. Lucky Ren's still alive . Friend lill Never get out of psych because he spoke. Silent violet im loud and on purpose do not be quiet see something say something.
WITHOUT THE SUFFERING NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE.  ALL GREAT ART IS BORN OF PAIN.  BUT YOURS WILL COME TO A CONCLUSION IN THIS LIFE, IN JESUS NAME.  I WANT TO PRAY FOR YOU REN, BRING SOMEONE TO LAY HANDS ON YOU. AUTO IMMUNE DISEASE BE GONE IN JESUS NAME NOW
I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR MUSIC EVEN MORE NOW THAT I KNOW FOR 100% SURE YOU ARE A CHILD OF GOD.  I ALWAYS THOUGHT SO BUT WASN'T SURE! KEEP SPREADING THE WORD THE WAY YOU WERE BORN FOR
🥹🤘🫡❤️💙
You are bloody brilliant mate! HI REN!!! love you human!
Ren, if you ever read this, thank you.  Thank you for sharing your demons and your journey.  An incredible masterpiece here.
The Shakespeare of our time
He got thet peaky blinder drip 😂
Were just milking this one idea now
I still think this song is referencing Jimmy beast 😏 but I listen to this visual and lyrical masterpiece so often I love it dearly thank you ren and Sam for this 😎
Absolute masterpiece! Genius as always
Wow
Goosebumps. This is an absolute masterpiece. Holding a mirror in front of society
<3
Wowwww🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Stumbled on Ren on TT about a year or so ago, so happy I follow on YT, Ren is special a once in a lifetime talent .
At first, I thought this was a disappointment from the second part. now im convinced im a fucking bot this is a lyrical masterpiece the story is just a high piece. like it's not even a song at this point just a story and a lesson
You are e motherfu***ing god to me, please have a date
Ren’s operatic storytelling performances make me feel like I’m a surfer. I’ve jumped in with my board and, with baited breath, await my ride. There’s an eerie silence as the wave approaches, building momentum. (Ren is setting up the scene. His silence is palpable. I’m transfixed and anticipatory.) Then the moment is right. I’m on my board about to ride the beginnings of the swell. (Ren has begun his rendition.) I stand. I ride the wave. (I’m with him now and loving every moment!) I fly through the barrel and it’s exhilarating! (Ren makes my heart soar. It’s Nirvana!) But, oh no! I falter. I lose my centre. My focus. I lose my board and I’m consumed by the wave. Rolling every which way under this mountain of turbulent sea, I have no  sense of which way is up. (Ren’s stunning and thought-provoking masterpiece has me lost and frantic, amidst a myriad of diverse emotions.)  I’m buffeted by the swirling white water. It pushes me with all its might and power towards the shallows. Finally, its grip on me is subsiding. I can stand on solid ground. (His rendition builds to a frenzied crescendo then levels out to its completion.) I stagger to sprawl out on the sandy shoreline, heaving with each breath, heart racing. Oh my God! What just happened?! Exhilaration, joy, shock, grief. I’m a wreck. But what an experience! The warm sun and salty air is a gift, but I can’t wait to go back into the surf! (I’m filled with joy, and immense gratitude towards Ren Gill, as I excitedly scan for more of his videos.) Thanks for giving me the surfboard You Tube and all concerned! 🙏🏻
<3
I think this really is rens masterpiece...
Whoa
So good
glad to see this guy is finally getting some traction, congratz on the 1+ mil subs and keep it up
Back again trying to kickstart the algorithm
I didn't know thomas shelby made songs
Wow this guy music is amazing so real with the world nowdays
Wow. Just wow. Well here I go down this rabbit hole! Bravo 👏 👏 👏
Just found this man's channel and I can honestly say I love it, love what you sing and how you sing. Geat music brother
This reminds me of my time in the theater as an assistant director. Get the preparations, samples, equipment, repair. Last minute disasters. Then the excitement of the dress rehearsal. Excitement and concentration. Ren must have felt exactly like I did on opening day. Just one chance. In your case, the rain was doomed to a one-take. And then the curtain. And even though it was over, nobody knew what to do with themselves. When Ren said he didn't know whether to cry- I felt that way. We were of no use for days. Premiere hole. When the play stopped playing, we would meet up and talk about how we were doing so we wouldn't fall into depression. We felt so lonely without the theater family. What I found particularly great about Ren's set: There was no evaluation afterwards. We always had to endure that the day after the premiere. Everyone knew what didn't go so well or what they could have done better. Why pick on it. Ren just thanked everyone and thats it. That felt good. He also thought about the little boy who shouldn't have to wear a sack over his head for hours. Wonderful. So focused. I always wondered: how does he remember every comment he gets along the way? I had to write everything down. Unbelievable, this focus! And the politeness on set. Simply great. I would work with a team like that again in a heartbeat.
What was part 1 and 2
oh my. this is amazing.
I bet the 3 words most British people say out loud after watching this is: ‘FUCKING HELL MATE’ (I just did)…  Genius..
I kinda feel that ren is going to be the new plan B
This is artistic singularity.
Amazing.
Not a daft lad are ya
The whole thing is beautiful, love the singing in the beginning
Hit me like a truck out of nowhere.
Ren where you ever a fan of the rapper Eyedea?
Just listening to all three parts in a loop, it feels like it was meant to be that way. It’s a cycle that doesn’t stop.
just wow
It's fantastic as like as art! Camera work, costumes, body moves, the idea, and of course the SENSE!
Nooit reqium for a dream the sacrifice
This guy is a musical legend ❤
❤
They need to get Ren to play the 2024 Super Bowl halftime show. Release Money Game 4 at America's biggest money-making game.
Wow
Whhoooo algorithm!!!!!
I know the Ren you show us in "Hi Ren" strongly disagrees, but you are a genius, and your worldview is passionate. The world is lucky to have someone like you.
ren i have a lil question. if you wouldnt get all the love nad support from your fans, would you still make music? as "self therapy" (as i like to call it)???
I’m looking ahead to your other uploads and wanting to just get them started. But I can’t leave this one unfinished. Thanks for sharing your unique talent.
Deam this song is something!
Much love 🥸😎🙂
waiting for part 4!!!
Without a doubt, the most gripping 'music' video I have seen in decades, possibly ever... Ren is such a beautiful soul & a true genius - and I never use that word lightly!  ❤  The creativity and talent and power in his words, and the gorgeous direction of this video... In a non-violent way, my mind is blown! Being crap with words I can't express my sentiments for this very well.  But - I'm genuinely moved.  Thank you Ren.
Incredible stuff.
This goes deep
This is pure art. Please don't ever stop
Such perfection.  And while a different sound, I appreciate it making me think of other past expressions through music. The piano, the lyrics, the rap takes me back to listening to Immortal Technique, Dance with the Devil
I was hoping for a "She sells sea shells" thing
Now this is BEAUTIFUL, and scary
crazy artistry and message
My my, gimme.
This is like the return of the king and I havent watch FotR nor T³. WHAT AM I DOING?
guys whats the name of the choir used in the song
My gracious! What a masterpiece!
I've thought I'd seen it all. As freaking old as I am. But the young continue to astound me with their uniqueness and bravery. I love his story-telling. His heart. And his willingness to tell the truth of life. Bravo Ren, please tell us more
This is a masterpiece
The Best ever
Love so much that Ren does...this format is my fav tho...i love stories and commentary🙏🏻🦾 keep going king!!
Remember when Queen put their Opus together and it was too much for mainstream ? Generations break the barriers of convention. Not often…….but it happens. It won’t be today.
Listening to this while playin GTA v is trippy. I just refused to get illicit cargo an I don't know why!
Everything about your art screams how much dedication and time and thought you have put into every second. As someone who is also being crushed under capitalism as a chronichally ill person, your music hits hard with me, especially your struggles with the VERY broken medical and mental health care systems. I dont fanboy often, but you're awesome and you deserve every bit of hype you've been getting. Please keep making misic, you are doing something more real and more raw than anything I've heard in YEARS.
I wonder who in the 30s had similar complaints
This shit is fucking fire 🔥
3:01 Woo Hoo. I just got a Sack Man figurine for Christmas!!! 😁👌🏻🎄
How am I just NOW finding out about Ren?! Everything is spot on!
Masterpiece. Will stand the test of time. Good work Ren
I cant tell if there's any cuts or not. Is there or is it?
The Tragedy of Humanity. Sentenced to an Endless Cycle of Death, Violence, and Misery. All disguised cleverly, as gold, sex, power and material wealth. We race for it, kill for it, stampede each other for it. Only to get to the end, and realize all that we thought we were gaining has vanished, and we’re left only with suffering. All the While, ignoring the only real prize, the prize of true love, happiness, and freedom around us. But we forgo it for suffering
Thank you
Awesome
A genuine masterpiece. Listening to this on repeat today and appreciating it more than ever with everything going on in the world. Thank you Ren.
🫀🔥✨
Please meet me omfg
I love watching, feeling, and listening to Ren! Amazing man!
Have you any time in your life been a bully love ya music
Amazing
Holy shit
Stunning
U´re the best. Still being beast till die...
puts eminem to shame
Im so close but youre helping im so tired bud and i appreciate you tons..... Love you ren
I truly hope you see this .I feel just as I felt when I heard Frank Zappa the first time. It was life changing. I'm probably older than most of your other fans. I can see brilliance. Man you rule!
It depresses me that Ren isnt one of the biggest music stars on earth. The system is failing.
Actual art
Wow
When he grabbed the camera and stared at me while saying "Cut the music". I think he just broke the 4th wall. Incredible piece of work and art. Made a fan out of me well done
This a masterpiece.
9:20  ‘Why did you make me like this?’”
I only discovered Ren a few months ago, I was kicking myself for not searching for new artists before!  I can’t believe how many of his songs relate to my life! Literally like a physical therapist who sings! Love you Ren! Xxx
Genius
Ok. One of the best things I ever seen in my life.
Algorithm love ❤❤❤❤❤
ur so beautiful ren.
You know, as with all great art, there's so many meanings you can pull from this song, but I don't see anyone talking about this one: This whole thing could've been avoided with five words: I'm proud of you, son.  The underlying theme of Jimmy constantly chasing his fathers approval, and it constantly leading him down worse and worse paths as the father is never satisfied, even while Jimmy's on top of the world. Until one day, even the merest hope of that approval is snatched away forever, leading him down a depressive spiral. After all, what was it all for? And the biggest tragedy? Jimmy himself probably never would even realize that's all it was.   Love your parents, make them proud, but more importantly, make yourselves proud, ladies and gentlemen. Because one day, your parents will be gone, and you'll still have to live with yourself.
Amazing work, damn
This is absolutely stunning.
"The way we live is parasitic fuck the money and fame." No truer words. ✌️❤️😊
Happy Christmas Everyone 🎉❤
I don't know how he does it.  So much raw talent and he was able to transform that into amazing music with cinematics that really drive home the meaning of his message. Ren is destined for great things.  Never stop and don't let anyone who doesn't understand get in your way.
Wow... mindblowing
im gonna find u in spotify, just u wait
Immaculate
Oh my God what a fucking video
I just got into Ren. It's great, different in a good way  Shout out from Australia 🦘.
For the algorithm. I love it, the song is absolutely beautiful
Found you through Tik Tok and I was instantly captivated. Just as Eminem and NF your music has soul and you can feel it. You will be big and you will help a lot of people with your music
Absolutely brilliant!!!
Masterpiece
Just wow
🥀
His masterpiece is yet to come!
I didnt know cillian murphy raps?😂
this is ART ❤❤❤
Just brilliant
Genius
Forever listen to Ren !
You are a musical magician!! It’s like listening to a movie that has you on the edge of your seat the entire time 🙌🏻 love your messages!
Lads side profile resembles Shelby
F@cking incredible !!!
I'm also leaving a comment for algorithm
😶#armukraineasap
Wow… currently speechless, but my mind is full. A masterpiece I will watch over and over again and still need to watch more to get every piece out of this glorious work 👏
Rennnn❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I get the feeling this guy could reach the very top of any art form he chooses...well done Ren
gud
Well a Macavelli of sorts master of everything bravo 👏
Is… is this all one take?? As someone who has done a LOT of film I’m obsessed with this. Ik you can fake that now but this REALLY looks like all one take. Ren is legit a genius and the set director ain’t bad either. Just plain wow.
all parts are good, this one was just best
I seriously haven’t seen a thing like Ren as a total music addict. He will be something completely new, I hope. Hopefully he doesn’t sell out.
Gun nut here, what pistol was Ren using?  I'm ashamed of my ignorance of a full sized pistol... 1911? 45.acb would make sense.
This is pure art
Part 3??
I fucking applauded at the end.  I listened to it a second time and I fucking _cried._  I do not remember the last musical piece that moved me like that. Holy shit.
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Cast this man as scarecrow in batman.
Ren your music has saved my life
Super talented young man
Woah
So much talent it's is crazy
OMG Ren, I'm speechless  what a captivating music video was this  and what you have sing about is a reall life struggle  omg I looove your style of singing and character and your message
BeSt song ever
These lyrics hit hard 🔥
Ren, I've just discovered you after a recommendation. Can I just say you're absolutely brilliant, the lyrics and music unbeatable. I have an autoimmune disease and have felt physically and mentally the things you speak about, you're an inspiration and a great help. Keep going mate and all the best for the future.
Please for all our sakes vote for RFK jr so that life as it is won't continue... the world will be a much better place if we can get Kennedy into power ❤💚❤️
This is amazing. I have fallen down the Ren and Big Push rabbit hole. Can't get enough!
wow
<3
When i was 17 i sold my soul to tashsul for a strawberry sprinkled donughnut southpaw shipleys4ripleysandbongrips
FUCKING BEAUTIFUL!❤❤❤❤
This  is pukka mateeees
nem o Gyokeres marcava um golo destes wtf (brinks era capaz de marcar mas mm assim pqp)
I really love the way Ren straight up tells you the message. It’s upfront and he quite literally tells you that “this is not entertainment.”, but instead it’s a message which feels as though it’s being told directly to you. You can really see how the passion flowing from every frames of the video and every second of the song. Ren, you inspire me and hopefully have inspired a whole generation. Please keep up the good work.
Wow! This is art with a capital A! Thank you so much for the message you're putting out into the world❤
Your music always gives me chills man❤❤❤❤
Dude is this like the kind of music those 12 year old creepypasta girls listen to dude what is this?
BRUH! omg
REN leaves me speechless! Incredible from the demo's, Freckled Angel's and he's just raised the bar once again with this. Music, Performance art, and a true understanding of the world ❤😊😊
99%like with dax sing style.
🔥DAMN THIS IS AMAZING 🔥
Wow!
💸
:0
This is art at it's finest. Thanks Ren! This is some of the most honest music I have ever heard. This world needs more people who think like you. Your delivery and lyrics are so on point.
algorithm
Master of music Ren❤❤
That cuts..
Does it get any better than this, it's basically a saga in music..
This shit is 9 minutes..... DAMN
@ren do you take your name from Mencius?
Insane! Love this
here’s what i think:  Money Game part 1 is from the perspective of the poor because:  The only instrument used is just a guitar a common instrument poor people have.  The video is set- somewhere…  In the video Ren wears that weird cloak thing and even when he takes it off he’s wearing just pants and a tank top.  Money Game part 2 is just a tutorial on how to go from poor to rich.  Money Game part 3 is from the perspective of the rich because:  The main instrument in the video is a piano a common instrument rich people have  The video is set in a warehouse which is used by businesses to make money.  In the video Ren wears a suit which is worn by rich people in case you didn’t know for some reason  What do you guys think?
That was powerful
Hyak doo chalad mak ngai?
holy fucking shit
What this story about
Wow!
Love this, all of it, amazing performance & details.
genuinely thought you were going to end yourself thank god
great lyrics again and great vid!
Fuck he’s good
This is sick man. Bought all your albums. Keep doing what you're doing, it's mighty cool, and it is awesome.
Ren....a collab with Ronnie Radke/FIR would hit on so many levels 😊
Ren is a fucking lyrical genius. Every one of his songs deliver!
imagine being able to dive into this topic like Ren. not only enough to think about it, but to write a freaking song about it. this dude is special. Ren ❤️
The new eminem
Grammy?
That piano score in the beginning deserves to be in a movie, and a very good movie
Деньги деньги дребеденьги, позабыв покой и лень...
Wow, Ren keeps getting better and better 👏🏼 another great tune Ren, keep it up
Everything absolute amazing.Ren is a Golden Genius ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Sending love,  hope you get as much cathartic relief as I do when I listen ❤️💯🔥🎶
Dude.
He’s a revolutionary artist in so many ways!!
Wow.
Tommy Shelby dropping bars
Great video,except the first minute with the piano was really good,before Second Pianist interrupted it.Trying to find how to play an extended version of it.It's the left handed part that's hard to place,so I'm trying out different chords.
🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷
🖤🖤🖤🖤
Love this song
God damn usted es mi amor❤❤❤❤❤😮😮y 😊😅🎉
Great work 😊
This is art
You know when a song is great when you wake up singing it, and you think what was that I was singing in my sleep, and then realise it’s Ren. Followed by my 2nd waking thought of WOW that guy is incredibly talented!
wow
Really made 3 parts of dunking on capitalism. Amazing.
It’s taken me 2 days to completely fall in love with Ren. Everything is just completely captivating and insightful. What an artist!
LEESSSSS FUCKIN GOOOOO REN!!
Fantastic artist
Remember everyone watch the commercials don’t skip it will add to Rens revenue
Thank you for the reality check to the world. Great classical piano btw. Great fan of classical up beat! X x x X
Okay Thomas Shelby!!! new fan from America
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Amazing
Bravooo! Shedevr! But, it's sad...😢
Please do a thomas Shelby song. I think the style of music and the possibility of the video sound amazing
Greatest video this year by far!!
Is carpenters park still kicking?? REN
I could listen to you all day, ur music has meaning amd that is what makes it beautiful
Words are fickle things, we spout them at each other to convey all sorts of ideas, thoughts, and messages. It seems like every. Single. Time. That we need/want them the most, they fail us. I wish there was a way to convey to you just how mind numbingly talented you are…but that just doesn’t seem to cover it. There are very few artists that evoke actual emotions out of me. “I like this” or “that’s real good”, your work gives me actual chills, hi ren brought actual tears to my eyes. You are a modern day bard. A true artist. Keep it up bro…please.
Can you imagine if this dude was able to write and produce his own film.. this is pure fucking talent. Even when the world is going to shit I can escape with this man's stories. Thank you Ren Gill you have no idea what you're doing my friend. You are basically a God
Speechless! Wow
Magnificent❤
What a great song. Thank you!
Only just come across Ren . Wow , that was amazing ,  i was lyrically captured, and the video and your natural talent in front of a camera, too .  We'll done .. New fan here
man, what a story
Fucking fantastic
Fuck yes
Cut the music 🎶  I love it ❤
This is America.
masterpiece.
Thank you, you saved me life
Dude i just came across a random video of this guy singing about seashells. Now I'm listening to lyrical genius and it's been less than an hour. Why isn't this guy more famous? This is poetry in somg format.
I like this dude different bit why cool
chills
Can someone help me and tell where can I find this amazing, silver-white ring that Ren is wearing?
Ren you’re a musical genius
This should be required listening in all high school economy classes. ❤️
baaaaasssssssss
So let me make sure I have this straight? you're an absolute beast on a guitar, that's for sure! Is that you playing that piano as well? You're an absolute genius I mean seriously that's unheard of dude like never have I even heard of it to be that skilled
This isn't my favorite song, but the video is just so wild I can't look away!
Fire
You should really act peaky blinders😂😂😂😂👌👌
Wow
Wow I listen to this amazing artist and think what a breath of fresh air and originality at last....keep going you are going where ever you want to go .
This is definitely more of a cinematic masterpiece than just a music video!
Can't wait for part 4, it will be legendary
If tHE WhoLe WORLD listen to this MASTERPIECE, Everything gonna change... #FutureISNear
Genius
"There is technically no difference between thinking about yourself, and being miserable" -Jordan Peterson
Ren's musical creativity reminds me of Eminem and Queen..put together. His musical touch with 'opera' elements is like 'Bohemian Rhapsody'..
Pure Gänsehaut. Thank you so much.
Masterpiece
Is this instrumental “Carter USM” MASHUP with  “Macklemore “
Riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves.
Do you still busk sometimes?
Absolute great piece of work. You are a real one for putting the names of the people who played a roal in this piece. 👏 👏 👏
Not only is this song amazing, but there’s no break in the filming
Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy One years old and his first words were mine, mine gimme Two years old, he was walking, three years old, walking quickly Four years old, he was running around the pavements of his city Five years old, and his daddy told him, “listen here son, you've got to learn to be a man A man who works for what he wants” Six years old, and he's reading, writing, top of the bunch And when he's seven, his progression made him student number one Eight years old and he's praised for unusual grades Nine, his parents pay for private school to nurture the flame 10, 11, 12, 13, he ascends and ascends, his daddy tells him, son, money is the means to all ends 14 solving complex mathematic equations, at 15, IQ 150, still elevating 16 he develops complex software code that detects weaknesses in cyber security protocol 17, and he sells his vision, keeping the share, not yet an adult But he's practically a millionaire 18, and his daddy tells him now you're a man the world don't give a damn about you So take all that you can 19, he turns a profit, stocks and shares, invest in product 20, double down deposits 21, his income rockets 22, he learns that truth is just an obstacle to wealth If you manipulate the data, then the lie will sell itself 23, a life of luxury Crystal and cocaine 24, he makes the Forbes list, they're applauding his name 25, and his daddy tells him “listen here, son, while you're sitting in that palace That don't mean that you won” 26, a business shift, he switches business to arms He's 27, dealing nuclear ‘n shells in Iran 28, inside the Senate, money bought him a seat He's 29, role of counsel in the president suite And now he's 30, his daddy says, you're losing the race You're just a servant to the king, not even in second place 31, a big maneuver for his daddy's approval Moving imports over borders from the exports out of Cuba 32, moving grams, growing kilo to tons He's 33, filling warehouses with powder and guns 34, turf war with nobody to stop it, blind eye from the Po po inside of his pocket 35, he gets a call, I'm sorry, son, but it's your father, had a heart attack I'm sorry, he's gone, 36, getting pissed up abusing his product 37, eyes glazed, disposition demonic 38, with a prostitute, a moment of passion Heating up the silver spoon and then chasing the dragon 39, getting reckless and hungry for power Daddy's words still driving him to kill him and devour He makes a move against the cartel, but the strategy's flawed They retaliate and leave him in the hospital ward A bullet buried in his vertebra, and one in his leg The doctor sighs and says, I don't think you'll be walking again, fuck  5:47   Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy He was 40 and he cursed the words mine, mine gimme 41, he wasn't walking, 42, not walking quickly, 43 Never running round the pavements of his city 44 inside a palace with a mountain of gold But those riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves Weighing heavy on his conscience is the value of gold, Lamborghini for a life Trading money for souls, Jimmy followed the code inside the land of the free Put your hand inside the cookie jar, take more than you need And his example is exaggerated versions of me, and it's a version of him And it's a version of she, and it's a version of you There's no escaping the blame, the way we live, it's parasitic Fuck the money and fame, cut the music  1:39  8:33  45, Jimmy comes home out of the rain, soaking wet upon a wheelchair Drinking again, he has everything he wants, he has fortune and fame He’s a fortunate fool with an unfortunate fate with a 45 caliber aimed at his brain 45, a fitting number because his age is the same Hears the words of his father, it's such a damn shame Then he presses on the trigger of a money game
Masterpiece
Just a wee thing I noticed, 5:19  where he just falls back into the chair without looking, it's like that thing people do were they have to fall backwards into someone's arms and trust they'll catch them!
God that was amazing so glad I found you Ren
Holy shit this is probably the most impressive music video I've ever seen bravo
Bro, my girl and I were on edibles perusing YouTube casually last night and landed on one of your other ones and it blew my mind! Then this today, I’ve never seen anyone like you. Amazing content/poetry/rap. Whatever you call it bravo to you and the staff for putting this all together
Amazing. You don't just write songs, you don't just do videos (both of which are brilliant) but your story telling is totally captivating. Just brilliant. :)
is this the peaky blinders movie they promised
<3
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ren... you leaving a mark man... just played this to my 86 year old mum... she cried... ok, we both cried... YOU MATTER.  Thanks man
To even label this man as just a musician is a crime he’s composing music while aligning them with visual artwork and storytelling and adding different genres into one this is full blown artistry at its finest and he’s a generational talent that only comes by through rare moments
He’s a tool rapping to a piano it’s unheard of fantastic brilliant talent  love ren
Algorithm
Just love it
I´m speechless.
Much love.!
This is incredible
Impresionante increíble brutal ❤
So many have tried making songs like this, Ren is by far the best at it. You are supremely talented and have gone through so much. It shows in every song you create and i can't thank you enough for sharing your soul with all of us.
Love it ❤
Story telling at it's best 10/10🔥🔥🔥
My friend was going to show me the type of guy he likes and instead I am fixed here by the quality of this song. Amazing!
THIS IS PEAK
My broken brain can hear what you say. Your music is he best
Speechless ...
Never expected a part 3, but I am really not complaining. You outdid yourself, man
He is! The world is his stage! R u blind?
you are realy inspiring with the art you creat ren! I hope one day i get to see you to thank you for  existing
Yes
Iv often said, new music sucks become it doesn't tell a story. And there's no substance, or truth in it. Artistic feeling, view, or depth. I stand Corrected... this is a work of art, a masterpiece. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 love it man. Also keep the Suit, it works for you. 🤘🏻👍🏻
Life is like a song:
She sells seashells on a seashore But the value of these shells will fall Due to the laws of supply and demand No one wants to buy shells 'cause there's loads on the sand Step one, you must create a sense of scarcity Shells will sell much better if the people think they're rare, you see Bear with me, take as many shells as you can find and hide 'em On an island stockpile 'em high until they're rarer than a diamond Step two, you gotta make the people think that they want 'em Really want 'em, really fuckin' want 'em, hit 'em like Bronson Influencers, product placement, featured prime time entertainment If you haven't got a shell then you're just a fucking wasteman Three, it's monopoly, invest inside some property Start a corporation, make a logo, do it properly "Shells must sell", that will be your new philosophy Swallow all your morals, they're a poor man's quality Four, expand, expand, expand Clear forest, make land, fresh blood on hand Five, why just shells? Why limit your self? She sells seashells, sell oil as well! Six, guns, sell stocks, sell diamonds Sell rocks, sell water to a fish, sell the time to a clock Seven, press on the gas, take your foot off the brakes Run to be the president of the United States Eight, big smile mate, big wave that's great Now the truth is overrated, tell lies out the gate Nine, polarise the people, controversy is the game It don't matter if they hate you if they all say your name Ten, the world is yours Step out on a stage to a round of applause You're a liar, a cheat, a devil, a whore And you sell seashells on the seashore
cine 🚬
Can´t get enough of this sh1T.... This is brilliant, a master piece,a lesson from/for life, and an example of a production where everyone is tuned in. CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL involved in this.
Nevertheless a hollywood movie. Ahh!
If you havent seen it - check outhe making of this video. Its really clever. Its one take
jesus, this is not the video I was looking for but its the one I got, what a message
This dude does it all i swear
Now we need money game part 4.
Pure poetry.
More awesome work by a great artist
That seems like a good life to me.
4:06 every Asian parent be like
If Freddie Mercury was born 30-40 years ago, this would be his masterpiece
Soo great 🎉😊
This is art. True art.
You're a true artist my brother 🙂👍
This song is absolutely beautiful. Truly one of my favorite songs. Screech's Tale os my #1 favorite. 😁
He is so talented  .... im always going on about the musicians musician... he has the cheat code for god mode
i have just discovered thia mans music .... ren .... VERY POWERFUL!!!!!
This is deep. I hope the whole world can see. And realize this world is more than about just "me". ❤
Damn, this whole song could be a movie. Great job man.
This is the second masterpiece I’ve heard from Ren today after “Hi Ren”. I’m so in love. His words just flow so well and make so much sense. Forever fan here.
Wow. Just Wow.
Bro, he thinks he's Tommy Shelby xd
Why do you scream at my soul so?
MASTERPIECE. Is all I can say about this song. Ren buddy you are a GENIUS
Ren is a bard in the 21st century  with kind of story telling.
I am speechless.  Both your audio and visual performance are next level. You are one of a kind and impossibly creative.
Is there anyway we can have a version of this song that is the official video audio but allows us to turn off the video so when I download it to my phone on YouTube(through the app) music I get to hear all of the masterpiece(I understand why it's a condensed version without all of the pauses and background noise but I love it more that way) but this will never be seen so I guess it's futile to ask lol
So good
I have no words, perfection.
✌️❤️💪⚡️
Truth is less important than the money that we desing?
Nothing to say. Stunned... Just thank U Ren & Sam for this piece of wonderful art.
Who knew a Luigi meme would put me on a song that slaps so hard.
This is so unique and refreshing
🔥🔥🔥
Who the f*ck is this genius????? I'm like speechless, I need more
Brilliant, beautiful, and more professionally presented than any corporate sponsored video I've ever seen. Ren, you rock! Plain and simple.
Loving the music my man thank you for sharing your beauty to the world
Poetry in motion.... ❤️‍🩹
Wow wow wow ❤❤
This is just f*** magic
is this a fucking one shot video???? insane
genius
I don't know  what this is but I like it
❤
Bump
cannot wish you enough success Ren!! this is fantastic man, keep going!!! ❤️🙌
I think it's about time you get into film.  A movie or a series.  You can do so much and reach more people, and even when you reach those people, you can advertise your channel within the show.
These is not even a song, it's... an experience, truly something else. I am truly impressed
I may not entirely agree with the message, but man the cinematography is top notch. You cannot but respect this.
The generation before me is making better music, this is good very good.
I’m 45, in poverty, regardless of the numerous attempts to step out into freedom. The game is rigged for the immoral soul. The meek are stepped on so the rich can step up onto the bluff of sadness. Nobody wins at the end of this game of sorrows. Save, filling that God sized hole in our hearts in hopes of Heaven where the meek can finally walk into freedom. The rich, its a long road down from ego’s peak. Jesus saves all, God will forgive by his precious blood. However, we must humble ourselves and ask him. Thats the only road to victory from this graveyard.
WOW!!! - thisain'tentertainment,it'slifeinthe'fast'lane.💔❤‍🔥
the guy from peaky blinder sings? thats cool
Wow, this guy can tell a story.
Another one bites the dust...
How can anyone top this?
Just showing some love to Ren ❤
Bro. that was amazing. I am 59 y/o and love your music as much as the music from my era. Thank you for all you do. The messages you put out are needed in this day and age. Keep up the great work young man. Stay up.
Holy shit this was amazing.
Truly genius❤❤❤
Has Ten thought of an acting or psychologist
❤❤❤❤❤ wow wow magnificent 😍😍😍😍😍
Biggie, that you…..¿   telling stories again damnnnnn
im handsome
Knocked it out of the park again. Amazing as always
Poem rap with classical music, amazing 👏
someone help, its been a month and I still can’t stop watching over and over
Fucking majestic!!❤❤
Where will this end when REASON starts to trend ... Utopia?
Its all about the stories man.
Ren is a musical genius
Folks, hear the calling
It's like the most perfect music video I've ever seen, the scenes are perfect the song is a banger and is meaningful, it gave me goosebumps.
This video is inspired by René Magritte's The Lovers.
Need to be careful with ren , I think he's a modern day pied piper  😮 history  always repeats it's self 😂
I hear tape hiss
People in surrey UK be like
I would love to work with you Ren!!! I'm a musician as well, located st Louis you ever think of coming this way? I've kinda been underground for about 6 years now.. but ever since your first song I heard I've wanted to try and see if you were down to talk to another underdog musician that has seen the ruthlessness of life and definitely can throw some meloncholic leftovers of a person at some shit. Lol  I got vocals for days!!! Amongst many other instruments n such. Anyways. I'd be privileged. Keep up the otherworldly thought provoking sound up <3 the world needs you <3 sending powerful healing vibes and love your way! ❤❤❤❤❤
Crazy good!
Mediocrity is self inflicted Genius is self bestowed Walter Russel. He wrote a book called The Secret of Light. Ren you are that light. Thank you so much for what you have already brought to the world. Looking forward to whatever is to come.❤
It's absolutely baffling how different this sounds from the studio version while still clearly being the same song... Great stuff as always
❤
Astonishing!
This left me in chills. Greed is our policy and money is power. Damn, Ren, I'm truly amazed by this.
Phenomenal as always 🤌
The track is amazing, but I love aaallll the little details and choreography in the video so much as well. Don't know if intentional (probably) but the bit where his world stops (and the little globe literally does) when he gets the call about his dad.
i love this song ❤❤
This is much more than a music video. A piece of art. I don’t think I’ve seen a better one.
Room to exhale thank you ❤
Full of energy, philosophy and poetry.
You are a gift to music and to the troubled minds in this chaotic world. Thankyou! Your music has helped me more than I can put into words. ❤ Also please, please, please can you come to Australia! You are the only artist that has ever really reached straight to my core, so much respect.
Thank you this was a checkmate type of song.
I don't know what to say.
This is masterful! Wow... I cant believe the traction you have gained through the years. We need more of this!!!
This.... is what you call art.
.. I collect deep thinkers, to decrease degrees of separation between us and between flailers alike, so that we may see fine enough details between us to solve the backlog of problems people not want to look at. Do this and we may pull a generation back to meet us & over the top of us. Then we & rewriters (court jesters and kings) should manage removing government without panicking the people. Come on let's use our heads.✍️😉
I think that you went to I may be on the same wavelength at the moment. Something psychic going on. Come check out my facey if you want.
HOLY PART3
This man is a bloody genius. Should be the next poet laureate.
I thought there couldn‘t come anything close to Hi Ren when i first watched it, but man, he did it again. This is true art. Thank you, truly
While Hi Ren and the Tale of Jenny and Screech are masterpieces, this demonstrates another level of songwriting! Ren is one of the most under appreciated artists of our generation. How can the generic shit that gets played daily on commercial media generate so much income! This is music in its purest form.
Love the story telling style rap. Has meaning.
That was intense!   What a tune.
You had me up to Cuba that you were talking about Joe Biden!!! ***Kisses from America!*** ❤ 😅 ❤
spettacolo
Man you could actually conquer the world with ya music, acting and whatever you set ya mind two. Awesome
I love how an ad plays of (ai) Andrew Tate telling me how I’m clueless and broke for not claiming money issued  by the government
You got us into deep 🕳 !
Absolutely genius.. what a masterpiece!
This was amazing. This geezer is just getting better and better much love from Brighton
Fucking beautiful
THIS is awesome, really o_o
I wish I had words to describe how I feel. This story works on the opposite spectrum also, and reminds me of my best friend who lost his fight against depression. 9 years without you here and yet always my best friend.
After listening to the song, i didn't expect the song to be slowed down slightly in the music video
Whichever idiot marked the first minute of this video as "off topic" in SponsorBlock is a philistine.
I am so freaking proud of you Ren ❤️❤️❤️❤️ this is immaculate
Nice
True words those😔
Life is either an incredible adventure  or its nothing at all .... choose your path carefully
I keep coming back to experience this masterpiece again. ❤
MIND BLOWN. Favorite storyteller 🔥
Damn bruv! I FEEL ya! Fuckin top shelf
You're a literal genius, as well as the people who helped make this video. This is art.
Love all your songs ren but this clip makes me think shitless you could be in peeky bliters and the new joker in a real joker v batman show you look like a bliter but you sound like the divine joker that has a message but not one listens because of the joker Esk vibe
Ren your Money Game part 3 is very evocative. You're ability to connect with other's is profound.  You keep captivating your audience, all around the world.  🌎 A standing ovation for you Man! 👏💯
Lyrical genius ❤
Masterpiece❤❤❤
I'm just speechless...this was well written
<3
This guys a musical legend.
Classical music
i didnt know you where good at piano  clap clap clap
algorithm
I have watched this hundreds of times over the past few weeks... Ren, you are one of the best orators I've ever heard. It's even more commendable that you are actively trying to wake people up.
wow
This is the art the world needs.
Trigger discipline is something you should practice especially on a video where 20mil sees it
this is the best music video ive ever seen and i watch it everyday
hole shit well done!!
But Have great music… yo… crazy musician
Crazy as a goat
You are craziest than me… but you have a great musical spirit!!!! So… you are safe
Find this guy through Money Game Part 2, like many here I assume, and his lyrics are both insightful and thought provoking, while being also captivating and having a wonderful flow that constantly keeps the listeners attention, a masterclass in what art can be.
Absolutely brilliant.  You are quite talented, creative, and original. I am in my 60's and am very concerned for our young people.  I appreciate your lyrics resonating with others of your generation.
Who is this guy ren and where have you been 👏🏽
My soul is in love with your music. Keep going...
Le comment
Praying you will find peace, true peace and joy, and the way to find it, is not just God, but Jesus, really finding Jesus. He has completely changed my life, and know he can change yours also. ❤
Wowow
This wasn’t a song, it’s a story. A message even. This is a masterpiece and should be praised. I’ve waited for so long for part 3 and it didn’t disappoint
Epic. 🔥🔥🔥
You are INSPIRATION and Beautiful Humanity Ren
Tommy Shelby? 😅
Masterpice ❤
deep ....
💯❤
David Bowie would have loved this.
Yep, the money game. I threw down the towel at a job I was working for for 15 years. The money was good, but when it came down to it... how much is my/your soul worth?
Made music and a story veri cool
It's time.
Freddy would be gobsmacked. God this is good. You are making people aware of themselves and others. that is powerful. I really love your music.
This.. highlighted the importance for me to lean on Yeshua, we are such a sick society, i dont see how humans can fix this mess. The only way this can possibly be fixed is through intervention not of this world.  Good work Ren, only serve the truth. Worldly things are for the destruction of man.
I’ve never heard anything like this. It’s perfect
Really amazing!
Ren, you are the most important human on earth right now. Sending love ❤
Dude I fucking love you! Everyone counts... U help all realise that. Everyone! Including your fucked up life (blessed btw) Pls psl ple carry on softening t journey to realness to t world! Everyone either needs to hear it or relys on it! As far as I'm concerned, u a massive Don. Thank u Mr x
This is amazing
I Love President 45 Long live The King
I love you❤
Angielski Mata 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I have gone down the most insightful and beautiful youtube rabbit hole just now^ <3
I love you! You're such an epic lyricist, musician...person! 🥰🥺
You have my attention
Beautiful!! On another note. Who here is old enough to remember the movie Fame? If you are then you just know.
Absolutely stunning piece of work, the message, the relay, the execution, perfection.
The last line gave me chills, masterpiece 😬
Ren trying to tell Us, that money its not all. There Is more important things to do at your short life. Like always briliant
This is okay. I preferred the low budget videos you've made. MG2 is my favorite of this trilogy, i listen to it daily ☺
wow, im speechless and in tears, Ren you are the saviour we all needed
Amazing.
the gun clicked i dont think jimmy is dead?
Modern opera. I am obsessed with Ren. Such a fantastic story teller.
Thought what this guy did with the song was pretty cool https://youtu.be/xNtnHfDG2eQ?si=zzWyRIRgFaNhC-2r
Brilliant ❤
Pure genius from start to finish
Well done
so cleverly done..... bravo man bravo
Followed this guy for a few years now, disappointing that hes americanising his talent now, a true brit  poet lost to the American dream
THIS IS SOOOO FUCKING GOOD
Honestly, this is why I love music. Story telling at it's best. This masterpiece is right up there with Ross Capicchioni and Dance With The Devil.
Speechless
Bro
Ren - I grew up in the 70s and experienced amazing music that has stayed with me all these years. But not since then has anything had the impact you have had on me. I truly believe you are the most gifted performer I have seen in the last 4 decades and, unlike anyone else, you have the ability to change our perceptions of ourselves and the world in which we find ourselves today through your amazing storytelling. Thank you for sharing your gift with the world Ren!
6 years old  How depressing reading that thicc book when your friend might be reading some fairy tales and enjoy the actual kid's world
i have stumbled upon gold
masterpiece
This is amazing. Wow.
Holy shit... Fucking incredible work.
Words of truth...
this is AMAZING, keep going Ren!
Wow, so creative, quite amazing!
spitting
This shit makes me cry, damn it
Really nobody noticing the inspiration and style from Hamilton lol
Another Masterpiece!
This is genius!
What is Ren's IQ?
Everything we do is Money Game to stay alive need money for and more and more and more and more and more
I love you ren saved me with your so beautifully put expressions of life❤
One of the things I've always thought separates real pieces of (media) art from the rest: a strong sense of the flow of energy of a peice. Meaning knowing when to pause, when to surprise, when to repeat or change tone... it's *all* in the texture of that flow. And this thing has that awareness x100. It's not just lyrically, musically and in terms of the video brilliant, it's artistically tasteful.
A story short which hits. Thanks
Just sucks to see Ren not reach his Potential
so incredibly gifted. his production staff is beyond, video people are fantastic. It all comes together and presents a touching, motivating message that we all want to be able to convey, and for me, not having the talent or thought process to do so.
that was good.
More!!!!!! why has it took 11 months for me to see your 1st video, and only 2 days to watch them all.... Probably cause all the shit that gets brought to my attention instead.. I bow to you sir, you give me hope.
I fucking love the fact that you exist and share your hard work with us.  You sir are a new kind of genius and need to be protected from the power brokers
Dude, accept it, you're one of the music saviors. Fucking powerful stuff!
Its the way this is all put together. From the obvious talent in the voice and musical composition to the camera work ........ Love the rabbit hole 😍
Hello algorithm
Dude!! This is the most compelling thing I’ve heard in my 43 years! Thank you REN!! Your wisdom is far beyond your years, your either the antichrist from the Christian bible or your a profit. Either way I’ll follow you until the end
Too much talent in one person, absolutely incredible, something divine
Thank you, Ren. This is art.
This is definetly in my top 3 songs of 2023, the story, the flow, the rhyming, its incredible! Thank you for this masterpiece.
Song of the week!
"then he presses on the trigger of a money game"  Holy shit, it's been a while since a song gave me chills. The whole "money game trilogy" is a fucking masterpiece.
I will most certainly rewatch it over and over…
🎉
Damn...boi looking slick af!
Nice, a bit strange to hear RP (or close to RP, I know he's Welsh) in a rap/hh song but it's awesome he doesn't sing about bullshit like girls and getting f...up. Plus, 9 minutes? It's like a performance, nice.
lovely music man
That last line gave me chills
NUMBER 1, CONGRATULATIONS!!! LEGEND!!
So f-ing great to see You again! I was so worried about you for a minute there love.
This isn't a song, this is a message, a great shout of human emotion. A piece for the ages!
Fucking epic
This is incredible.
More people gotta hear this.
I need part 4 please this is 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This reminds me so much to Hamilton. But it sure is it's own thing, sounds and feels great to hear, the message is great, so the story telling. This is amazing.
A true artist, beautifully done.
This is way too fucking perfect...
We all know about the cut behind the wheelchair - but can someone settle the debate about the "phantom cut" when Ren takes off the money bag on his head? His hair completely changes in less than a second. I've seen people vehemently defending each side and it would be nice for some clarity 😂  Saying that, it doesnt really matter either way - the song and video are an absolute masterpiece ❤
algorithm boost
Need a big orchestra version
Jestem tu od Winiego. Ten numer to majstersztyk!
I was listening to The Correspondents - Fear & Delight and the start up is the same no?
Amazing 😮
I am new to your music, I found your music because of Knox and so far I already have 6 of your songs in my playlist that I can’t stop playing! Your music is just incredible and I can not wait for more! Lost all faith and Sick Boi, Pt 2 are toed for my favorite!
Majestic. So Original .  Happy day of Music in Argentina. Great. I've seen '' theater dance'' with Pina Bauch Here is '' theater music '' It's also a Happening.
when i don't have enough time to listen to the whole song i just listen from this part, 5:52 ,its so beautiful
Sadly and happily Impeccable…
❤"£~MVP..mad onna mang,zall yours💥lovin all your stuff~🇦🇺🤕🏴‍☠️CW Puffing Billy Posse🎭
The beginning makes me think of the artist Magritte.
thank you Ren. Thank you
Genius mate...Genius!!
With love from Russia. You best ❤
Connect with me brother,   We are of a similar mind.......
Your effort deserves at least 1 billion views
When you were 15 you had an IQ of 150?
The adverts which come when we are here are very good. Hi would you like some blah??! Is that harsh.  R
Musical genius
Ren is a genius I have listened to so much music over the years but nothing like ren’s there is something truly unique and special about him. Nice one ren, nice one!
You are the definition of ART! ❤
I love this song. Revisit like bowie. This is one of the best. We never know how to live, we just live.
How can a 9 minute music video feel too short. Big love Ren xx
I'm in my 50s and your music strikes my soul. I'm from east London Council estate nothing changes so sad
No artist has ever made me cry but he’s on another level
A fellow Welsh man 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
The guy form Big Push! You're real talent, man! Respect!!
Brilliant in terms of creativity and entertainment value? But the ideological narrative has the political acumen of a petulant 15 year old.
Hey new sub but huge fan here.. Really havent bought an album since I was 14(saying this as a 90s girl). I'm saving up to buy all of yours. Thank you for doing what you do. It IS connecting. I've had cancer and severe autoimmune for my best years... and am still struggling with that and god and the why of the people I've lost over time.. let alone being enraged by the way the world is and how it affects me and my loved ones daily.. and how we may all be a part of it but it seems impossible to fix. You will never know how many people you help by just resounding like this in this way. It feels less lonely. No pressure moving forward but i know so much of the world is watching. Just keep being you and stop giving when you need to. Don't let others needs override what you need. I have a theory that's what good artists suffer from the most. The want to provide/preform/give and with too wide of an audience and too much care for said audience that you can easily get torn apart. Like in a slowly heated bathtub anyone can start being boiled alive before they notice the danger. Please dont forget to protect yourself now that youve rightly 'made it'. Thank you again for the work you've done!
Hope: “I’m the voice you hear when you loosen the noose on the rope…”.   This return line from “Hi, Ren” is important. In the beginning of the video, Ren (Jimmy) loosens the noose from the “money bag” around his head. Similar bags were used when people were hanged so that the audience/executioners did not have to see the physical, human reaction to their death. Facing the truth of death, struggle, and, ultimately, being guilty of whichever crime someone is guilty of, is important.   Ren’s tale of Jimmy is one of revelation and of hope. It is one of self-realization and regret. But also, it is one of warning to the future; a chance at something better if people would just “heed this word to the wise”.   Brilliant!
Brilliant ⭐️
Art.
True masterpiece!
6:23 Ren's eyes shift to look back at the Quartet , and shout Jimmy followed the code in the land of the free . While I am enthralled with his entire performance,  that moment gives me chills .
Masterpiece 🤌🤌
tommy shelbys son started raping
To me, this just shows how americanised England has become today and why i live in the Highlands of Scotland today ❤
I always leave your videos like this one with this weird shiver that does down my neck shoulders an spine.
Wow.
I love how this song is the exact same length as Hi Ren, 9:20 💫
Just when you think Hip-hop is dead and buried something like this comes out of nowhere and hits you like a ducking brick to the head.
Whoa! REN constantly exceeds himself, challenging the gods for supremacy. William Blake would be more than proud of Ren. I thank God that I live in the same timeframe of this monster of creativity. & truth.
This is amazing 👏  keep doing what you're doing ❤
True Dude
masterpiece
Very powerful message and song.  Just a little concerning it wasn't prefaced with a trigger warning. I know there are folks out there who are sensitive to certain topics and imagery who might have benefited from foreknowledge.
Sometimes I wish I can hear a Studio version of the intro.
I know nothing about painting, but I fucking love Magritte. And I know nothing about poetry, but I fucking love Ren.
Ok, one thing I notice in the comments Ren is this: many people are just here to congratulate you on your talent (which is immense btw) such as, wow this is art, this is my favorite, music of today isn't as good as this etc etc etc etc blah blah blah. When the reality is 'to you obviously' it isn't just about those things (even though, the pure effort, and again 'talent' you have, puts it into all these brackets) Meaning: for those who see beyond the front, this is your truth, the way you actual see the world, not just made up just to entertain the viewer, and your truth is correct!   The reactions people have should be 'more so' in agreement to the message itself! Unity should form by those who see exactly what you are saying and why. The stuff you preach in this video is what I have been telling people all my life, even since my childhood I could see through the man-made farce society is trapped in. The lies, the deceit, the GAME! And what I realized is this, no matter how clearly and concise you can put it to people, people will not do anything about what they agree with you on! Instead their focus lies within the entertainment it gives them from you being an artist! The message gets lost on some people because they have zero clue how to take action, and the never ending psychotic loop continues for all eternity! and no action is taken. However, keep it up! Those who can see you, see you! ;)
blg mh .;.
You’re I beyond reproach, your goodness and your kindness, and your understanding of the benevolence of a good fire fight. You’ll never understand what I’m telling you about because you’ve never been there I have, but you have become a beacon of hope and I thank you for that and even more I love you for it, you are my friend and whatever you need for me I’ll give it to you if I have it but don’t stop keep pushing forward and push that message that needs to be read your book that always inspirational
You remind me of the genius Nick Drake
Imagine this wind up like Brandon Lee incident... Good song! Be safe, happy, & careful everyone!
Back again and it's always perfection with REN REN.🤘
Grieg👍✌️👏👏👏
опять скучная депресивная нудная муть.....
One question: Was Jimmy happy at any point of his life????
It's impossible to describe how good this song is. Very impressive. Keep it up mate.
Love this song
Jedes Mal wenn ich deinen Musik höre weiß ich ein Teil von mir wird Verstanden... Von dir, von den anderen die sind wie ich, wie wir...  Manchmal träume ich davon verbunden zu sein, mit euch, mit allem , aber es wäre zu viel, zu schwer... Ich bin länger als mein halbes Leben krank und ich weiß mit jedem Buchstaben was du meinst... Es ist so tröstlich jemanden zu wissen der weis... I Love you😢
REN!! The legend not known much yet but let it trend and see the people attend, but let's not protend that the elite will depend sign it away or push thur to the youth to reproduce some independence, build the numbers like the cucumbers for a pence but we act offenced and are fenced in this trench..
Thank you Ren! You are feeding millions of souls worldwide, please never stop!
Brilliant! Just brilliant!

My 18 year old son and I have been estranged for months. I’m broken-hearted. We used to listen to you together. I just decided to send him your video to reconnect. Maybe he’ll respond. Why you? Because you embody hope. 😢

for REN and the algorhythm.  Ren is helping my mind to hold on.  Thank you my friend! This is art for the soul.
UNA OBRA MAESTRA!
Brilliant Ren. And Samual. Love your work.
I am mesmerized by this entire production.
Rens talent rivals that of boy with uke and he might even surpass him
awesome!
Back for more
I swear I'm back at the Hamilton production. I love this. You are like being at an opera.
i want the full piano piece
I was expecting a song, not a whole movie better than marvel!
Gritty...beautiful...truth......
I'm shocked how almost every song you put out is incredible. Both the music and the lyrics.
Real music tells a story and yet again this incredibly underrated wordsmith has proven why he’s at the top of the game. Another absolute belter from the legend that is Ren 👏
46: the trigger ticks but no bullet is loaded…
Wow 🙌🙌🙌
I’m in love
The song is amazing but can we all just appreciate that Ren and that suit work together waaaaay too well
Absolutely genius!
Is the end Jimmy playing Russian roulette?
god, i love this song. absolute masterpiece.
This song made me want to learn the piano
His dad wasn't wrong.
Increible sexy ppl!!!!!!
Wow! Ren you always leave me astounded. Your wise beyond your years and your delivery is so mind blowing. Jaw dropping, heart beating fast and hands applauding you!
Masterpiece (amazingly placed) is nothing compared with the Impact on real life 💯  Who hasn't shared yet, Ren ain't playing, he is real. 3.2m as for today. Let's POP some more brains with the magic of music so they expand out of imposed limitations.
This is a genuine masterpiece and i dont like new music too much ❤
Never in a million years did I expect someoone to use the word vertebra in a lyric
Simula to a song called Mickey by spare destiny well worth a listen if you've never heard of it,.... Class again renx
Will guide future souls !  Timeless Genius
I’m def a bit in love with you! In a very pure way! … I love your intelligence and your soul shines through.. just a beautiful young man in all ways..
Good shit
I didn’t love love this song (tho I love all Ren’s songs)  til this video. Really puts it in context ❤
only a 3M views?? it should be MORE
That was awesome .love your music ren
only leaving a comment for the algoritm. Have nothing to comment. It's complete.
You sound like a prophet..xx Now sing about how this world, as we know, is ending. Rejoices in the finish ....😮
Masterpiece ❤️
This is pretty damn cool
This is History. You know that right?
I knew it! U r a fuckin genius.
"this isnt entertainment" this is TED TALK.... 😮
Thank you sir. :)
I had tha edition of the Beano. Awesome music again.
MASTER freaking PIECE!
Damn this a whole operatic. This needs to be a feature film.
it truly is a masterpiece what an Artist
cant wait for money game part 12!! itll be hype
❤
This is unbelievable. I can’t really add anything to what’s already been said but it would be remiss of me not to leave a like and a comment.   Perfection, Sir. You and everyone involved should be incredibly proud. Changing the game.
kas tas par sūdu
Huge fan for 4 years now .....come to canada!! Will have you Free Place to stay right on the water on pigeon lake near "bobcageon" (tragically hip song)....be happy, stay getting healthy my best and strongest vibes Im sending your way brother!!
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
It is a very interesting take. I've seen people say this is anti-capitalist. But I don't see it. The part criticising herd metnality is itself a critque of anti-invidualism and communism. I get the vibes it's about nihilistic greed above all else.
Yasss
all team do great work
Ren, your an amazing story teller and musician. You could definitely do an amazing job in film as well. ❤
Excellent Job Ren!.. keep it going. You make beautiful important human focused points.
What happen to those useless morals pal, the issue was the complete lack of hate in the life of jimmy.
scary good!
Bro came back with another banger and deep message 🗣🙏💯‼
Damn, that spoke to my soul! 💜 LOVE everything you are doing. I am honored to witness the masterpieces you create from your mind to share with the world. Can't  wait to see what you have in store for the future. 🙌
I am 53 and consume a shit tonne of music daily. This is one of the most creative and unique sounds / acts I’ve heard in years. Ren’s talent and pain have created pure genius.
wow
∆
Hi, Algorithm!
Why is there not more of this impactful music that actually makes you think instead of the garbage social media tells us is good music.
another Masterpiece from REN 💗Bravo 👏👏👏👏👏👏
💚
Need this music. So meaningful. Speaking truth
Praise for one of the greatest MV I ever watch for my music experience.
I've been sitting on this for a month without watching it because I wasn't ready yet. Now I have to sit and think.
It's rare for someone or something to hit so hard these days. Really powerful.
How is Ren not no1 in every country he’s an actual genius
This dude is a musical genius!!!!😊❤
It'd be great for Joe Rogan to speak about The money game series Ren has beautifully produced!!
Incredible!
In a world where "Gucci Gang Gucci Gang" and "Wet Ass Pussy" can thrive as lyrics...this music actually gives me hope for the future.
Wow, after a month I've only just spotted the little nod to Blind Eyed.
The bar just rose with this. Ren is different gravy.
Deep realization
It’s like if Scorsese made a music video. Ridiculously good.
People say this is a masterpiece but i don't think so...  I think masterpiece is too short for this this is even better this is a MOTY Music Of The Year
He is a genius, a poet.
Every time I think I have a favorite Ren song another one drops and takes the number 1 spot
Money game 2 is still my favorite ngl
*Takes off mask* *checks self in mirror* "OooOOOooOOoOO 😏😏👉"
Ren , even if your stories are full of darkness , you are like a ray of hope   keep being true to yourself it transpire trough your music 🤟❤️🤟
this is so incredibly good at so many layers
So awesome and briliant!!!
How did I just stumbled upon him via an Insta reel? Damn that’s talent!
holy shit this is incredible
tjezuzz I LOVE YOU REN!!
ren going hard as always ngl
nice song hehehehaw
I was moved so much. Truly. You are such an audacious and thoughtful artist.
I feel like I'm watching a whole movie with each new song I hear! Incredible work
the start was 007 type shit
I’m kind of at a loss for words @Ren this truly is a masterpiece. The composition and execution are flawless but the most beautiful bit is the message. curse the words “mine, mine, gimme”
It’s been a while since I’ve had goosebumps from watching something… there is so much brilliance in everything this man produces. Such deep and important messages packed into beautiful art… brings me to tears and gives me hope at the same time! Keep on doing your thing Ren! The world needs you
You can really feel how in each part of this he went more and more into the message of the original, and it keeps hitting harder. Respect the truth
You're amazing!!!
when did tommy shelby learn to rap
Insane cinematography
GODDAMN!! ❤
Genius.
Absolutely insane!
The Money Game series is a fucking masterpiece. Thank you, Ren
Taliesin Ben Beirdd in truth

powerful delivery of a very important message. phenomenal, truly phenomenal. have a nice day and regardless of who you are, don't lose yourself in fame or this whole money game.
What a poet
Masterpiece
Redefining music with every new release... brilliant Ren
1 word: GENIUS
I don't think I have ever heard a song better than this. Keep up the great work!
thats amazing ❤
This whole money game trilogy is very motivating to me. Its literaly about me fr fr
10/10
He is the prize! Genius work.. Global star!!!
I can’t stop watching this video ❤
This is amazing. Glad I discovered you even though it was through a meme
A Welsh poet / Ren - An American poet / Jim Morrison  No other artist has poetry lyrics like Jim Morrison like Ren has shown.
I love it
I've been putting off listening to this song because every song i listen to by this guy gets stuck in my head and i end up listening to it on repeat.   Jesus fuckin Christ, here is another one.  Ren is such a god damn beautiful artist.
Ren thanks you so much for sharing you  music and everything about your health. I feel alot like you cause I been abused since I was a child I  never belong  anywhere i was told i have bipolar when try to tell people that i was  rape and now I Sick with Hiv. That I  is understandable and so many times I  thinking deserves all the abused will medicine and emotional they game just more medicine a few beatdown, insomnia and sleep apnea, covid-19 and Cancer i among gave up but listening to you.and chinchilla are helping me A lot now i doing much better i finally are contesting with my sister  and her family the only reason I don't go out is because one of the times I was in the hospital they misplace the flipper of my two upper front  teeth  and can you believe that after everything I suvive i don't got out anywhere beside a doctors appointment or went I asked my Sis one a month to ride me to a larger supermarket. I would never with ask her or anyone else for $$ I just need a dental flippers i get a little ssi that I used to pay all my bills and I away pay all my payments but not dental insurance cover the fonts teeth because they call them cosmetic. So do any one in the ren monkey holes some dental flipper makes for about $300. In NYC Because I would like to not be a shamed to go out after all this Year after every the cancer all the medicine and ps i didn't have bipolar it was PTSD For all the abused Thanks you Ren and everyone else for let me get everything out ❤ you all and one last thing I'm a good listener piece and respect
Ren
❤
The story you told is very good,  but Jimmy shouldn't have pressed the trigger!
Mesmo depois de anos acompanhando o Ren eu ainda me surpreendo com o quão talentoso ele é! Love from Brazil ❤🇧🇷❤
The world don't give a damn about you, take all that you can....It is hard to watch others do this & seem to succeed. I'd rather be a giver than a taker though, regardless of the supposed rewards. In the end it feels way better to support, not judge & love your fellow humans. Much love everyone ❤
What the fuck, he did it again
This is the perfect harmony of modern music styles, old school music styles, story telling, political commentary and just PURE ART
I like when he develop a software to detect weaknesses, i feel that cause I've been through 😊
I have never in my life have heard such amazingly clever music that touches so many souls because ren has had a lot ove his own turmoil. I thank the lord for real reality music.i hope your dreams ove a happy future will last for ever.all my love nicola 😊
Powerful
Masterpiece!
i do hate the political situation of the world too
Still one of the best original artist out there!
Just love it
😊
Briliant, master piece
Beautiful music, love it
Amazing work man
Whoaa, BRILLIANT ❤❤❤
Genius absolutely, he is a genius ❤
That was amazing man. What a genius
I've listened 2 this song over a dozen times now and it's wow factor never goes away, what a artist ren is
Thanks for making this <3 Lots of love to you and everyone
Bravo!
I’m 22 and I now realize that truth is just an obstacle to wealth. If you manipulate the data then a lie will sell itself
Jet my absolute favourite! Keep going man 🫶
This has the same rhyme of brittle bones nicky at the start lol
Ren is a generational talent, and this masterpiece is a perfect example of why that is
Strong ❤🔥🔥🔥
I love how the visuals are included to really enhance the video and tell a story.
I am 13 years old, and I think that this is one of my favorite songs. REN is underrated in the younger generations.
Ren is the epitome of a top tier artist. Absolutely amazing talent, fantastic ideas, and the videographer(s) are perfect as well. What a master of the craft. Hi Ren 🙂
Damn. Absolutely speechless. With all your content. Incredible.
I am a burned out 40yo webdev, this video was the first time i heart of you and .... i lost a surprising amount of water trough my eyes - this hit deep. So for the last few hours i binged your art.  your lyrics remind me in many ways of the speech in the great dictator - the visuals of the antwoord and donald glover - but the delivery tops it all.  unbelievable honest and authentic - i am floored that a sick young bloke from the uk can cause such a strong reaction.  As i battle to not become cynical, this weirdly gives me hope - in the younger generation and generally. you sir have a truly beautiful mind, and are about to take a rocket ship into world culture. the entertainment industrial complex is a monster and i hope you can prevail.  surround yourself with good people, but as in a rocket launch there comes a time, after the group effort, when the countdown runs, there is the call out "all guidance is internal" - remember this before you sign anything! I wish you health, fun and balls of steel. thank you🖖
man o man you are trule briljant , and allas also right
The apsolute best piece of music that ever was
didn't know Thomas Shelby could rap this good
This is great
Always amazed love you ren
Absolutely incredible. Life changing work.
Long way from busking here
Love love love
You are the BOAT
"Then he presses on the trigger of a money game" Oof literal shivers.
This is truly amazing. You deserve way more recognition
It's been a long time since I heard something like this.... great great job 👏 👍 👌
I was told to listen to your music and I am not dissapointed.
You Are The GOAT
Amazing x
So good
Ok... After watching the BTS of this videos production I have to give a huge round of applause to not only Ren for the flawless delivery and execution, but also to the small army it took to pull this off in a single day. That is truly amazing. Be proud of this video because you deserve it. But I've been saying that since I first discovered your music Ren. You're a light to many of us and your outlook on life is genuinely rare and refined. I can't wait to see what you think up next. Much love Ren and the crew. The #RENaissance is NOW!
That dude is a genius 😮
Nice story Ren
Another masterpiece from our Ren.  I have a different interpretation of MG3. Yes, on the surface it’s about the pursuit of money, material gains, and power.  BUT all that money cannot buy him the one thing that seems to drive him even more than the pursuit of wealth and power … his father’s approval/ respect/ praise - really, Love.   - 5 years old and his daddy told him listen here son You gotta learn to be a man ,a man he works for what he wants ( at 5 it’s definitely love from his father and it sets him up for later  - 10 11 12 13 he ascends and ascends His daddy tells him son Money is the means to all ends . So if the end is really the love/ approval from his father he sets out to get it through financial gains  25 and his daddy tells him listen here son While ur sitting in ur Palace it that don't mean that you won 26, 27, 28, 29 …Jimmy switches business to arms, buys himself political power  30 Daddy tells him he’s losing the race, just a servant to the king not even in second place  31 A big manoeuvre for his daddy’s approval Then 35.. his father dies.  And Jimmy spirals.   39, Getting reckless and hungry for power Daddy’s words still driving him to kill and devour  45…  Everything he wants he has fortune and fame He’s a fortunate fool with an unfortunate fate Everything he wants he has fortune and fame He’s a fortunate fool …  Hears the words of his father; ‘such a damn shame…  Which is why Jimmy spirals ( age 35) after his father’s death. It’s also the death of any chance he had to hear “I’m proud of you. I love you. “ Because no amount of money can fill that void in one’s life and, especially, the void in one’s heart.
Phenomenal
GOD
❤
Another operamatic masterpiece... well  done son. - Surry Virginia
Heavy
This is out of this world. I bet even Eminem watched this movie.
ren you are a genius
Utterly speechless. What an amazing work of art.
Quality
You are a legend. I think your make the kind of music people will still hear in 20+ years. At least I will.
Masterpiece! Love from Italy ❤️
<3 bro.
love all your music!!!
Ren = Thomas Shelby
Sad that This is true
Ren is incredible!
I can't believe it, I found a musical god and I have fucking Luigi to thank
It's been almost a month and I still have this song engraved in my head, you did an incredible job, Ren.
45 also a fitting number since ive watched this at least that many times already
That is actually the best performance I’ve ever seen.
THIS IS AWESOME!!!
This gives me goose bumps every time... Such a good lyrics
Wow so deep and unfortunately so true. We need to change
The camera work immaculate.  The chereography Pristine. The Stagework Clean. The Lyrics obscene. Ren taking aim. Money game.
Woooow Masterpiece every time ..

I love ren
Bring your music to the stage, live performance ..ive known about you for a few years love the creativity and hope you keep on making music an videos, awesome 👌 very talented and under rated.
Your cool but not real!!!
Your musical talent combined with stage craft is amazing.  First time I listen. 2nd time I looked at the props.  Props my friend
Can’t believe I ended up here from a video called: “Luigi talks to himself about sea shells”.
I'm not into the new age music, but all I can say this music and lyrics are so deep and true of what the world is today! Keep up the being awesome work man!!!!!!
This man has beautiful tone, reminding me of some Otis, very old sounding voice.... Edit: I mean this in a good way...
Such a good video and song. Powerful stuff
Wow. Just wow.
I am 63. I was pissed drunk in my little bedsit on my own when I came across this. By the time it finished I was cold sober with a renewed direction! Thank you for sharing your talent young fellah!
And here I thought, "Thomas Shelby was played my Ren?"
This is brilliant this is something you pay to see at a theatre!
He is not only a musician but also a great storyteller and thought provocateur
The piano music here is next fucking level. 💯
The fact this was done in one film though adds to the masterpiece 😮❤
The music alone is fantastic. If this song had no words, I'd still enjoy it.  The lyrics, though, bring it from merely fantastic to indescribable. Coupled with Ren's superb acting, and I honestly can't praise this video (and indeed, the entire Money Game trilogy) enough. This is the single greatest music video I've ever watched. Not the most entertaining, not the one I found the most fun to watch, but the greatest. Because let's be real, this isn't fun to watch, or to listen to. It confronts one of the core aspects of humanity, something we all struggle with even if we like to pretend we don't.  I will end the comment now, as I fear I would otherwise write an essay before long. I genuinely cannot describe the feeling I got when watching this for the first time.
wow....
Your song writing is beyond amazing. The way you tell a story inside of a song is beautiful. I'd say keep up the amazing things you're doing. But everyone already knows you will. Much respect
Hey, I love the instrumentals, anywhere I could find an instrumentals-only version?
3 mil in a month, lets get this to 10 before end of the year
Wait this came out just 4 weeks ago? I really like what you are doing. Some true rap that isn't talking about how cool money is and instead tells a meaningful story. Also, incredible execution in the videoclip, and to think it was all filmed without cuts, it should had been hard, but I feel like it was worth it.
Beautiful, as all. But your solution solved nothing.
My words are too small and my applause too little for this masterpiece! Thank you, Ren!
Mate you should really go into film making. Art.
Wow
I'm a fan of horror movies but I understand now that horror is just the best version of  least we don't understand about normality.
This is a masterpiece of art
Im in love with the piano intro. Please do continnue that tune, even as a piano only piece. 🥰   This song is a winner in every  posdible category so get ready for the awards. 😉
You make me cry in every single song please stop
3 million views and still so many missing out on you #Ren
Keep sharing and motivating REN so that he continues to hold up a mirror to the society in which we live. He has a plan that is supportive. Stay tuned everyone. cheers the Old German Dude 44 years old und stay in my fu. wheelchai. never give up
Your music will lead the revolution. Never stop.=
This shit is powerful
Bar for bar pure masterpiece. This is a pure reflection of the dog eat dog world we live in today. I wish the best for all of you in the comment section. We will over come the corrupted world governments and corrupted people one day. Stand strong stand proud. No matter where you are.
Anyone know what the significance is to The Beano Book 1987 sitting on the child's desk when he is at the computer? Ren does nothing randomly so it must mean something - either to the story or to him personally. Just curious and I am also unfamiliar with those books in general.
Holy feckin feckerson. These only gets deeper and deeper. Thank you for your work.
The 3rd act! ❤❤❤
Dear Ren, that was absolutely amazing. I'm writing this after hearing this song (and seeing the video) for the first time. I'm impressed by the way that you made me actually focus and 'feel' this song. Best wishes, Mate.
Another song that will leave a huge impression on your ever growing audience, your ability to speak such truth while making simultaneously gorgeous music is greater than anyone else out there. I hope all is well with you Ren and a huge thanks for all of the amazing music you create and bring to life. My entire household listens to your music, my dad first discovered your music and shared with the rest of us, and keeping up with your releases is an amazing thing to see all of the family do.  I am a big fan of all of your music, and I thought that the Tale of Jenny, Screech and Violet couldnt be topped in terms of pure lyrical genius and enthralling story telling couldnt be topped, but here you are with this, my favorite to date. I study A Level English Literature and the wordsmithing abilities you have are at levels of the greats of literature. Much love from all of us here.
Ren is transcending. For real-real. ♥🔥
To watch the BTS and then see the outcome made it that much better.  You are a GODDESS DAMN GIFT TO THE WORLD REN
Fun fact: this helped me on a test. The petry dish and mold line helped me on a science test.
*slow claps until the tears stop*
I watched this multiple times, and it keeps getting better every time. If you want to change the world, start with changing yourself. We all could use a little bit more positive change in ourselves and this world. ❤Love it❤
i live money game frfr
Wait..he plays Piano too?
Musical art at its finest 👏 👏 👏

Why am I crying!?
so damn good
Well done, namesake, well done.
fua
Finally I feel it completely..
Another masterpiece ~ Thank you for sharing your brilliance Ren
Wow. Amazing masterpiece
Genius!!!!🔥🔥🔥
This is absolutely amazing
This is awesome! I love this! A sound mind can change perspectives... Thank you This Is a brilliant video! very well done! This is a strong message! had to wipe my eyes... you are a beautiful artist!
We cannot build utopias, and attempts to do so all end in death, misery and promises of "Never again."
This is what art looks like...
ear candy
this was posted on your music video 7 years ago titled " its alright"         6 months ago Ren, I know you will likely never see this message. The medical issues I face have destroyed my body and I also face the likelihood of an early final chapter in my life. I just want to tell you to keep going! The world needs to see those of us that are invisible.   This is the case for a lot of us, but this person may have took your music to the grave, a lot of artists have listeners like this, but with the uplifting that reaches your fanbase, it hits different when you know people can tell you they love you and tell you sensitive information, they relate to you.
Hi Ren, a masterpiece. Recently discovered you thanks to tiktok. something ive only just started to use, i dont really use social media.  You remind me of another artist i used to love, scroobius pip and dan le sac. so inspiring and heartfelt.  Im 28 and lost my dad to cancer back in 2019 before the pandemic hit, I found a note in my phone from the days after he died and it broke me to know thats how low i felt at the time, i never learnt how to express my emotions. i keep them to myself. im surrounded by family but i cant share, since i lost him i dont have a male presence in my life.   growing up i had friends, we drifted apart, i was in a lot of different circles but no long standing friendships, i dont have my own voice and dont even know where to look to find it.   your music has moved me, thank you for sharing and doing what you do from the bottom of my heart.  Take care.  Lisimbob
🤯
And again....back to the seed. Un genio.
Hey REN ; my daughter has abound 60 poems that she would love for you to read Mate . Will you please read her poems ?
He's getting more and more sad throughout.. well sung!
Musical Shakespeare.
Finally, The trilogy is complete!
Love it. Comment for Alghritm
Masterpiece.
Yeah.. just hand him a goddamn award for this masterpiece!

The intro copied a little from Edvard Grieg - Piano Concerto in A minor, op.16
Need an orchestra instrumental version of this man !
damn.
Luigi got tired of saving the princess and begins drug trafficking :
It's interesting, i've been sharing this vid to my friends and colleagues. Because i also think it's genius, it's a piece of art. Art copies the world is what they say right? Ren expresses in a 10 minute clip, what i've been trying to communicate since i was a kid and realised that we are all the same, one big unhappy family. From plants, to animals, to us. All of us, a product of evolution on this magnificent and probably extreme rare and special planet making this whole life business possible. Not to be found elsewhere in the universe. It is a shame what we are doing to each other and ourselves. What a waste.   Anyway, most people i shared it with, weren't able to see/hear/feel/understand the performance Ren did here. Now, I wonder... is this a matter of taste? Am i fanboy? Haha. Or... (my preferred answer) are they just less developed in art & music?
Over 3M 🎉👍🫶💐🥂
New version of Hamilton 😄
I love Ren's music, this is truly a master peice but, is ren a commy
Lin Manuel Miranda might need a writing credit here
Brilliant! Someone from UK standing up in a manufactured music scene and dreadful running of the country.
🖤   to see this performance live - I live for that day
Must of watched this 30/40 times, absolutely love it, been a ren fan for quite a while now! This just hits different
luv it!
holy shit thats fucking brilliant
Greed gets to me, I wanna hear an extended string part,  I will loop it myself
This is a fckin banger
Incredible, as always 💛
❤ truth is just an obstacle to wealth ❤
You are a fucking musical genius.
Tell me the name of the game, and I will tell you how to play... Because I have already played it, and lost... Our boarders are invaded and our cities no longer house our folk.  Now I am trying to understand it again, for my people and folk, from here on its not for me it is for my people, so I can no longer afford to lose anymore than you can... Please don't play this game against me, because you will lose...  Because death will beget death and I can guarantee, we are so much better at kill than thee...
THIS IS ART
Where is that tune from in the start I’ve heard it before
I always knew Ren was just Thomas Shelby
Legend has it the that Ren wasn't capable of curing the world of delusion or everyday elusions but he saved most of us from feeling like we were not alone, he provided a power in numbers vibe. A street busker, Nottingham had nothing on him. No need to steal anything just giving us the data to protect ourselves.
Thank you ren🙂
Why do I feel like I just saw The Fall of the House of Usher compressed?
When the music stops and he’s still killing it 🎉
Struggling for words really.. stunning level of artistry, like a torent of suspense and enthralling theatrics of verse and emotion woven together with razor sharp truths.. phenomenal performance
Ren, you are a genius. Big Love 💞
100% Ren for the next James Bond intro....the start of this is perfect! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🤘
A modern day Beethoven. 100/10 💎💎💎

Whoaaaa
I was hoodwinked. But not as cool of a hood sack. Any of the times.
Very good and smart. Please do not stop.
:)
I don't know if you will see my comment, but i showed your videos to my colleague who is theatre critic and PhD in theatre and she said you are very good actor. And from her it is a high praise. That's it, just wanted to share this ))))
This is pure perfection. The best I have ever seen in the music industry
I love the reworking of the lament from Violets Tale at 1:38 https://youtu.be/a4R9Vk5_CbU?si=P9VxAkO-fhJgPXxC&t=0m57s  Such a soulful and powerful sound!
Absolutely adore you iconic wordplay, never stop being you mate
This comes off less of a "wake-up call" and more like the tale of what a toxic fatherly relationship does.
I have been binging this album for days now and I don't plan on stopping - Such great music
As the old one good af... keep it flowin'!
Holy shit,  I have goosebumps and the hair on my arms is standing straight up!! Amazing storytelling music! You earned a fan and a follow! Bravo sir
I have no words to describe my amazement, thank you Ren, keep making such wonderful videos
when the daddy issues evolves
Absolute genius.  I really hope you get a Mercury music prize nomination for the Sick Boi album.
Amazing song,
My only criticism is that the name of this channel would be more accurate if it were ‘Ren Makes Artistic Masterpieces’.
Incredible deep message. Ren = Masterpieces
Loved this! Keep it up 👌👌
Outstanding talent!
notice how the globe stops spinning as he hears of his fathers death, his world literally stops turning...
Brilliant absolutely brilliant 🤩

Amazing, brother. Absolutely amazing.
What do you define as “creative” ?   This…. This is truly creative. AND UNIQUE !!!
THIS.  Is brilliant.
Again live?
This is an Audio Visual Musical masterpiece 🙌
As someone who lives in a 3rd world country and with no perspective for my future, this hits really hard. Thank you, Ren.
I'm truly in utter awe. Each time I experience this, I find additional appreciations for all that it had to take to create such a rich and vivid story. Filled with haunting music, and expressive meaning. I just love everything about this. Ren, there aren't words to adequately express how indescribable your music is. You are a unique, talented and intelligent gem.
Please be THE FIRST, WHO GETS THE WORLD, but doesn't loose the values and ideas. 🖤
1:39

Awhile ago i made a comment saying Jenny and Screech was peak for Ren. He replied to my comment saying "wait for money game part 3" He wasn't kidding, this is master class. Love seeing this dude break through on the billboards. Keep climbing Ren, we will be with you the whole way up!
I was just listening to a Wagner piano concerto and this reminded me of it. You're a gifted composer. Nothing more sexy to me than piano.
Masterpiece

No conocía a este hombre, pero después de ver esto ya se que es un absoluto genio
I’ve shared this with my son . Two of my brothers . Randoms I’ve met at restaurants , shopping or just running errands. I’ve said for years if we all stand united we can stop this division .   This version of you and of me . Of her and she .   So there can be a real future to see.   But Ren it’s starts with songs like these .   Money Game 1 &2 set the stage.  All to stop the money game and greed !  Cookie jar has enough so just let’s take what we need . The song Ascends  like Stairway to Heaven in the way it builds to its dramatic end .  But no one’s like you  !! Truly a masterpiece!! SVH
love your work
oh, rain, rain, rain, rain
Damn
🅱️anger
such a masterpiece.
Always chills
This is unbelievable, might sound weird but it's on some bohemian rhapsody shit
Man, he is a good storyteller... The music is secondary, the story is at the front. Amazing.
2.9 million people watched this. And only 125.000 gave it a like speaks volume
Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the life.
Don't let the internet ruin this masterpiece by puting it on insta reels
yep why do humans love a dived so much? unity!
You had 26 letters to mix up in literally thousands of ways and you put those letters in such a way that it created something that will stand the test of time. 😮😊
I hope you puts an instrumental version of this on Ren makes stuff channel. I am a HUGE fan of the piano on this one. The piano playing tells the story just as much as the words and the visuals do. 🎉👏👏👏
So glad i found u shits so fire i did some reading and geard u suffer from lyme disease i had it when i was younger brought me down to 50lbs just know ur gonna be fine on the other side just wait and fight dont give up ever
Your music is so deep
This is a masterpiece.
Ren
sick
I'm leaving yet another comment... Because I swear I've contributed to 1 million of the 2.9 million views. I cannot get enough of this song Ren! Your talent is unrivaled. I can't wait for the collab between Eminem and yourself 😍😍
comment for algorithm
The music, the lyrics, the cinematography,  the message. Just perfection
dis song gud
Another mind-blowing tune ... Thanks Ren ... Much love 🤍
Say it again, in as many ways as it needs to be said in as many ways as needed to get the message across.
Amazing. An accurate reflection of the capitalist basis and superstructure
The lyrics at 44, hit so f*cking hard
! Ren - Agree with KnoxHill - this is a Masterpiece & a Master class in genre hopping creative storytelling. Well Done! ##  Just been watching 'Great Measures' [ Metalhead & Classical Musician ] Reaction to this. Think Classical Guy {who is a Sweetheart! } is on the Spectrum. AND, just thinking how damn COOL it would be if you and he somehow - someway -  made something together!  If he / you were interested that is. Wot think you???  😆😊👍
Though it is quite rare, a thing of beauty can bring pain.
Mind boggling how absolutely brilliant REN is. His work should be considered required education.
Cant believe this man only have 1 million subs hes singing and flow is just wildly amazing
I can't describe what your music does to me. I'm so captivated by what you do. Amazing
I remember hearing this song before seeing the video... and now I can't go back. He just cranks it to 11... every... damn... time.
Holy fucking shitballs! THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS!
Just one of the most amazing original sounding songs I’ve ever heard
Cilllian Murphy if he was a musician and not an actor..::: brotha kills it
"commUNITY" is the proper spelling... I WILL box someone for that fact :)
The sheer power and weight of some of these lyrics is truly amazing and really gives you stuff to think about, my absolute favorite line in this song has to be "44, in a palace with a mountain of gold, but those riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves" especially when the context of the right of the song is considered.
This song does stay 😂 in the mind !  😂 love it epic 😎 😂
Random comment for the algorithm:  I've ordered vinyl of Ren couple of days ago & I haven't been more excited about a thing in a very long while. I have pretty solid collection of amazing artists: some unique items - but waiting for those 27 days of delivery from UK makes me feel like xmas - I'm just counting days like a little kid. I haven't been so invested in the artist for years. Love you all, hope you enjoy his music & support him the way that is affortable to you: like, sub or ordering some item :)
Brilliant :)
In 1948, Shirley Jackson's "The Lottery" appeared in The New Yorker. At first, it lures you into thinking that it's the story of humble farmers and their families living in small-town America. But by the end, you realize that this rural community where everyone knows each other on a first-name basis is not at all what you were expecting. I was in middle school when I first read it and during a class discussion, I distinctly remember another student commenting that while the protagonist accepted the system, she didn't accept what the system was doing to her. I feel like Ren's message is similar but with added emphasis that "We're all part of this old money game." Jackson's story portrayed a game of sorts and is titled with a word that has a strong association with money. Unlike Jackson, though, I feel Ren is saying we have the choice not to play a game that gives immense power to a select few.  Ren is absolutely brilliant.
Authentic...
Epic
Pretty intense....Cheers bo!
I agree with the message to a point but while many of the things we hold as concepts, are in fact concepts everyone agrees to as a society, they are just tools. They are not designed to inhibit growth to take from the "cookie jar" but to bake cookies so more can have some and in return for the service gain something to which they can continue to bake more cookies. Can tools be abused? Absolutely! That doesn't make the tools bad, it makes the abuser of the tools bad. There is such a thing as a bad person, yeah sometimes they were raised in a bad environment but that isn't what makes them bad, what makes a person good or bad is what they do with what they are given and in a free society not one person can stop you from becoming successful but yourself. In controlled, authoritarian, socialist societies, you are told what you are allowed to achieve, what you can create and how much.
two words: fuckin masterpiece.
Is ren a Shelby?

Masterpiece ❤
Again, Genius.
Absolute Genius you are Ren
This is pure Ren
THIS IS A MASTERPIECE!!
THIS IS A SHORTFILM OF HOW BEAUTIFUL THIS IS BRAVO
God. Damn. There is no doubt Ren is a master at his art, but I also want to shout out the master class in visuals that we just got, with Sam's cinematography (that into is just *chef's kiss*), Beau's FANTASTIC steadicam work, and Jack's focus pulling on the fly like that (Used to 1st AC, know how hard a one-r steadi shot cam be). Fucking amazing work by all.  Ren, your words and your concepts are second to none. You're wise beyond your years, and I want the world to hear and understand your commentary on the state of it. Please keep creating these masterworks of art ❤
Tommy shelby innit
Love how you just hear a click at the end and not a shot:)
I must listen to this about 10 times a day and every time it’s gets better, I get more into the song every time. Absolute masterpiece
BRILLIANT!  I would give just about anything to interview REN for my rock and roll show
i cried it with this letters <3 so awake
This is musical genius in its purest form. There is nothing being created like this musically, lyrically or with this much creativity and especially not all of them at once.  Great job brother keep up the great work!
inasne

That's It Tommy
Am i crazy thinking those bags...money bags... intellectual property... the creative freedom an artist needs... that's the symbolism of the bags?
SO good
Imma call this man Charizard cuz' he can only spit fire.
It's the beginning to chocolate rain
Pure genius! Stunning talent. Such deserved recognition 🙏🔥
OMG
Ren is incredible! So freaking talented in so many ways. Its a bonus how attractive he is
Let me tell a true story about my life… “2001, born from a mother 16 years old and a corrupt father with terrible strife… mother not even an adult yet, made sure father wasn’t in my life… year by year, mother made sure that I had a good life… taught me well to be above the want for money or fame… and I grew up so that father and I were never the same… two years from today, mother died from condition unnamed… father, 20 years gone since my birth, tried to teach me his legacy of useless gains… tried to “make me a man”, to make me play the money game… but within my soul seeing through his lies of “wrong or right”…  had I fought him and pushed him away on that midnight… for he could never break my true strength… of God’s Hope, Love, and Light…”
I;m a dark metal dude and I totally love this.. all his stuff transcends genres...masterpieces.... thanks
This deserves every view and like. Ren blows me away every single time.
Pure theatre, I’m so proud of Ren for bringing us something that is very much worth listening to and seeing.
Yet another Masterpiece by you Ren. I just love you and wanted to tell you that you have made the last 10 months of experiencing your unique artistry  pure joy.
I wish this was the exact audio that is on the track on like spotify.
i fucking love this dude
Yoy sound like Number One from code name kids next door
it feels like im listening to a painting
"if the culture doesn't work, don't buy it" English is the international language for economics and money. Its fitting money game is in English.  I personally think the biggest issue we face is not thinking about the future hard enough. Many laws we pass are focused on an immediate fix that will only benefit the group that passes the law. Ideally politians should be thinking of the people of tomorrow, ensuring stability for the future. Shortsightedness is the greatest of human flaws as far as i see it. Just behind it i think ignorance is the next of the human flaws. No matter how much is presented to a person they can still refuse it, weather or not its better.
Fucking chills man 5:22
Part 3🥳
Yes, we have indeed found the one true Rock'n'Rolla.
pt2 better than 1 and pt3 better than 2, waiting for pt4
This is a wonderfully beautiful theatrical narration of the story.
Damn....
Finally art that we can listen once again.....
That's actually quite impressive.
Love it, another great piece.
loved this!!!
Love ya Ren. Another masterpiece of profound art and music. The theme is existential to say the least and, frankly, I agree wholeheartedly with your sentiment.  Where capitalism thrives there is no freedom. When the goal is profit over prophet the civilization is doomed. And you my friend are a prophet. Have you ever considered entering a show like America's Got Talent? I think not only would you win it, you would blow their socks off and raise your profile by magnitudes. I would suggest you play "Ren", as it tells your story and it is such an important message and they love stories of people overcoming their struggles.
Just wow
WTF? What a masterpiece! Genius
Glad to know im not the only criminally sane fucker in this mad world.
*LYRICS:*  Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy 1 years old and his first words were "mine, mine, gimmie!" 2 years old, he was walking, 3 years old, walking quickly 4 years old, he was running round the pavements of his city  5 years old and his daddy told him "Listen here, son. You gotta learn to be a man, a man who works for what he wants." 6 years old and he’s reading, writing, top of the bunch And when he’s 7 his progression made him student number 1  8 years old and he’s praised for unusual grades 9? his parents pay for private school to nurture the flame 10, 11, 12, 13, he ascends and ascends His daddy tells him "Son, Money is the means to all ends!"  14, solving complex mathematic equations 15, I.Q one hundred and fifty, still elevating 16, he develops complex software code That detects weaknesses in cyber security protocols  17 and he sells vision, keeping a share Not yet an adult, but he's practically a millionaire 18 and his daddy tells him "Now you're a man! This world don't give a damn about you, so take all that you can."  19, he turns a profit, stocks and shares, invest in product  20, double down deposits, 21, his income rockets  22, he learns that truth is just an obstacle to wealth If you manipulate the data then a lie will sell itself  23, a life of luxury, crystal and cocaine 24, he made the Forbes list they're applauding his name 25 and his daddy tells him "Listen here, son. While you're sitting in your Palace, that don't mean that you won."  26, a business shift, he switches business to arms He's 27, dealing nuclear and shells in Iran 28, inside the senate, money bought him a seat 29, a role of council in the president sweet  Now he’s 30 and his daddy says "You're losing the race! You're just a servant to the king, not even in second place!" 31, A big maneuver for his daddy’s approval Moving imports over borders from the exports out of Cuba  32, moving grams, growing kilos to tons He's 33, filling warehouses with powder and guns 34, Turf war with nobody to stop it Blind eye from the Po-Po inside of his pocket  35, he gets a call, "I'm sorry son But its your father, had a heart attack. I'm sorry, he’s gone." 36, getting pissed up, abusing his product 37, eyes glazed, disposition demonic  38, with a prostitute, a moment of passion Heating up a silver spoon and then chasing the dragon 39, Getting reckless and hungry for power Daddy’s words are still driving him to kill and devour  Makes a move against the cartel, but the strategy's flawed They retaliate and leave him in a hospital ward A bullet buried in the vertebra and one in the leg The doctor sighs and says "I don’t think you’ll be walking again."  Let me tell you a story about a boy named jimmy He was 40 and he cursed the words mine mine gimme 41, he wasn’t walking, 42, not walking quickly 43, never running round the pavement of his city 44, inside his palace with a mountain of gold But the riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves Weighing heavy on his conscience is the value of gold A Lamborghini for a life, trading money for souls But Jimmy followed the code inside the land of the free Put your hand inside the cookie jar, take more than you need And his is example is exaggerated versions of me And its a version of him and its a version of she And its a version you, there’s no escaping the blame The way we live is parasitic, fuck the money and fame Cut the music  This ain’t entertainment, this is real life The way we live is lunacy, community, it declines Hyperpolerised - always fighting, then we divide Truth is less important than the money that we designed?  Moneys an invention, politics from our invention They all come from peoples ideas Did I mention Borders in invention Law and order fuel the tension That leads to people killing each other? My solution  Everything is subject to change We can builds utopias if individuals were taught to use their brains But if we teach kids in school to always be sheep And put ourselves before the herd if there’s more money for me  Then there’s no future I see where the humans survive Were parasites in side a petridish with cannibal minds Mould grows upon a surface it consumes till it dies And our fate could be the same without this story for the wise  45, Jimmy comes home out of the rain Soaking wet upon a wheel chair, drinking again He has everything he wants, he has fortune and fame He’s a fortunate fool with an unfortunate fate  With a 45 calibre aimed at his brain 45 a fitting number cause his age is same Hears the words of his father; "it's such a damn shame."  *THEN HE PRESSES ON THE TRIGGER OF A MONEY GAME*
Woow just woow 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻💎❤️
She sells seashells
Holy Shit.... Damm👏👏👏
Leaving a comment for the algorithm. This is a MASTERPIECE!!
seashells she sells indeed
not a song, but a message, and a powerful one...   Masterpiece. one word, yet a perfect description.
Long time ago i've discovered a talent like you! WAUW!  You do look like Tommy fucking Shelby mate.
❤❤❤
I could listen to an entire album of Ren’s humming! Politics, money, borders, all made by us. Politics, money, borders divide us. We are all sheep made by our governments who use those 3 things to keep us divided and greedy. We are the ones who should be working together to change our ways, we cannot depend on these things to sustain us. We need to work together or our society will self implode, just like Jimmy.
Great video, very powerful. Lyrics are a masterpiece as usual. The artistic message against capitalism, I could of done without. That number has been played a million times. I have come to expect the unexpected from Ren. A young artist singing about socialism and its pitfalls would have been a nice change.
Amazing young Sir! whole album is on repeat - love it!! so happy for you Many congrats on the album reaching No1 and right now 2 weeks and 2.8 million views!!! ha ha yeah boi
Sliiiick!!
Wow! Amazing!
can't wait for luigi to cover this
Listened to the sick boy album on the way to the psychiatrist and back. Made the tears flow. As always, love this piece of art. Love the Trump tie, the characters and the amazing filming. Kudos to all the artists on this project 🫶
Why am a not getting notifications for only channel am really bothered about getting them for
Love how it got so serious at the end
powerful man. Great work
This is what i call a masterpiece. Big up from France, keep killin' it !
oh my god  the way he delivered that last line gave me chills
Ren without frontiers 🥰
There are several artists/songs that have moved me in one way or another over the years, but YOU REN, have created something special. Thank you for sharing your gifts. ❤
I would love to see this here genius with the facilities to write his own Television show, or even a movie if he would be interested. The way he is capable of painting legitimately interesting stories and fully visualized worlds through music while underlying it with purposeful subtext, it's a gift as well as a skill you rarely see these days. I'm already attached and emotionally invested into characters he's capable of portraying in songs that are only a few minutes long, so I couldn't begin to imagine the world of intrigue he would be capable of putting out with the idea of longer term formatting in mind. No matter what though, Ren is definitely an artist in every single sense of the word, and whichever passion he lands on next, I'd really love to see.
When will luigi teach me this
New fan Just thank you
you are a treasure in these dark times where creativity is forgotten you are a shining light thank you
Another masterpiece
Maksim mrcvaaa introoo
Intrusive thoughts are winning, so I want to comment that the fact the name used is Jimmy and he is rich just makes me think of this as an alternate universe evil Mr. Beast
Been with you for a long time, Ren. I’ve always thought you were something special, and I’m glad you’re getting so much attention. I like listening to songs where you actually have to LISTEN to them, not just enjoy. You really need to listen to the lyrics and music in your songs, and that’s what I appreciate. I first found you through money game, then got hooked with Jenny’s tale and Screech’s tale. Been a devoted follower ever since. Keep doing what you do, love your voice, love your message. 👊
Always an eargasm listening to Rens music
60 How the fuck did I get to be 60. ..... this right up there with your best SICK BOI. X
very cool
Boy are you crazy
Magnificent….truth❤❤❤❤❤❤
New to Ren, the second I heard Chalk Outlines that was it, I'm a huge fan of Poetry so he just blows me away with his writing skills.
genius
Geeze ren,  never seem to miss do ya.. what an experience sitting through this masterpiece
Can't get enough of this song, love from Spain.
Holy crap. That was amazing.
Better and BETTER ALL THE TIME!! Truly pushing boundaries with the sheer genius he puts into every track and every story.
❤
What a bloody vibe!!!
that's a deep text.
The way were livin is parasitic
This video is nothing short of visual and auditory genius.
Masterpiece 🙌🏻🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Real talk this hit me hard right now, made me tear up you absolute legend of a wasteman
The ending gave me the chills
one of the thing i love the that Ren does is at the end of a lot of his videos is he closes his eyes. Because the eyes are a window into who we are, and when his eyes shut, that window closes, and we are left to ponder what we've seen. Thats my take anyway. absolutely brilliant.
It seems so long since I've had someone in music stand out like this.
This is the song he wrote for Hunter Biden
Holy. Crap.
This is what 21st century music should be. This is what the internet was created for. This is a testament to our generation. This is music incarnate. This is perfect
I was here when you got thousands of views. So proud to see how far you come!
😮🫨🤯❤️‍🔥 omgosh.
On Point!
We need more of this
This is like the villain version of 7 years old.
Just starting the journey…
Wow, I mean really wow.
Sounds good in THE STREETS
Damn I didn't think he could outdo Hi Ren.  Maybe there is a mountain of talent here.  Just wow.
Wow...
I hear you BROTHER..
This man is a genius! Mozart incarnate
How are you real
so this is what shelby is up to
Not bad  its more musical theatre needs a hook for chart success
you brother have some grade A talent
the video made me think about "The lovers" by Rene Magritte. Anyone else??
This is too much man
Truly, Ren.   You blow my mind every single time. I felt everything and I 1,000%, loved how in tune you, the set and instruments were. How you've set the whole video out, you can see how smartly you've put it together with such powerful connections to each and every piece.  Anyway, shutting up now.  Cheers lol x
This is one of the best things I experienced in '23. Bravo, maestro, bravo!
Gorgeous!
U should try "gentle" music u have the voice for it
Extremely talented this boi
A friend just told me about this and am I happy he did. This is awesome.
Keep up the great work. Love your stuff!
I really hope the music industry never gets ahold of Ren. He is way too talented for them.
like edgar allen poe
A Masterpiece!
i am crying a river - so emotional!!!best i have seen in musical form ***This is the world we live in, in our tears we swim - are you ready to dive***
fucking genius
OMG, part 3 in insane！
deep
Masterpiece
This gave me severe goosebumps, I hear nothing but truth. You are a lyrical genius and really have a unique way with words. Thank you for this masterpiece. I'm entirely grateful for this experience.
Cuando corta la música te deja muerto en un momento  súper potente... noooooo! 😢😢😢 Brutal
7:20 whats the solution?
There are great short films, great actors, great musicians, great rappers, great poets and thinkers. and then there is this! An amalgamation of all the Above at A+++ quality. This is the first song I heard of you a short 2 days ago and now i have listened to you for hours, reading explanations to your songs! I don't know if my words will reach you, but I know that ours will! Couse i am not alone i see it in this list.  A lot of small influences is what truly makes a person, a happening when you were young, a drunkards slur or a friends hug when you need it. i Can´t say you have said anything that hasn't been said before, or that my life's been turned around completely from what you've done. What i can say is that you have made a small nudge to the life's of million's of people, to think before they talk and look before they do. Thank you!
Goosebumps on my goosebumps. I hope you never get famous, but I know you will. 😢❤✌️☮️💟⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Groovy
Ren for community leader 2023
Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy 1 years old and his first words were "Mine, mine, gimme!" 2 years old, he was walking; 3 years old walking quickly; 4 years old, he was running 'round the pavements of his city 5 years old and his daddy told him "Listen here, son.

Just… wow
!!!
Masterpiece ❤
Hey, dunno if you've heard of Watsky? I feel you'd enjoy his 'Lovely Thing Suite.' 🤠💜
CONGRATS GETTING NUMBER 1 .. REN WE LOVE YOU DUDE
What an amazing artist wooww👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Art
Bravo!  What an outstanding  artist . ❤
When a work of art can make you feel as intensly as a real life tragedy, miracle or some unforgetable moment, then its more than a masterpiece in my eyes. Its a timeless masterpiece. I wouldnt even know what to say to Ren to praise him enough for this. I felt this work of art in my bones. I needed a breather after it was done. God Bless.
Amazing dude
My name is Jimi and i fight with Lyme just like you. It has taken 7 years out of my life. Your music is so powerful and gives so much. Thanks Ren!
Money game 3th
Wth

Ren, Dax, and Tom MacDonald need to meet up.
rapaz o homi é foda em
Congratulations on the number one.
just straight woooowwwwww
Babe wake up luigi thought me capitalism part 3 just dropped
Brilliant!
Masterpiece 💜  As a "sick girl" myself, finding your music a while back was one of the best things that ever happened to me. You're so creatively able to express and convey the things so many of us feel deep inside, but don't know how to express or articulate ourselves.   You deserve every ounce of success that comes your way off this piece alone, not to mention the entire album. Can't wait to get my hands on the vinyl!  Lots of love from a small town Canadian sick girl 💜
I love how you personified the "finger on a trigger of a money game" as an actual part of the song, so cool!.
Ren smells like patchouli and GBP
Im not into rap but... thiis is so fucking awesome.
Are you inside of a ship?
Love it❤
Art. Period. 🙌
We need to make a meme out of this one too. this deserves so much more visibility
Speechless. 🔥
..then he pulls the trigger winning him the money game
Exceptional!
absolute legend. You deserve every moment of success your art brings you and those involved.
Inspiration 4 Money game part 4? https://youtu.be/QbTWxFwuQtM?si=oBgiR-7rtRLYiGOq
Masterpiece.
It's 4 billon  Deal
An system based on the exploitation only will lead to suffering, profit over life will kill us all
Well done Ren, after a release like the last its great to hear even more growth. I know i'll be buying the new album. i hope to see you out on tour over in the states at some point.
Oh dam
Ren genius again another masterpiece. Simple nothing more to say.
thanks ren
🔥🔥🔥
wow.
Art. Pure, art!
Cautionary tale as a masterpiece indeed
honest, hard, and painful but important lessons being thought by music
Not sure why people think this is good? Honestly, he is regurgitating beliefs and ideas that have been around for centuries. And that will never come to be. For a Utopian society of any kind to exist at all, you need to take away what makes us who we are…independent thought and choices.   This seems more like a complaint story from someone who isn’t old enough or wise enough. Someone who hasn’t lived it, but only read it or heard it.   He isn’t rapping or singing really, just talking in melodies, which is fine. I honest to God , just don’t understand why this is popular?   Yes, the idea of having to work hard to make it and become successful is something lost on most today. Maybe that is why this is so popular, because it fits in the tiny minds of the youth who “feel” like they are owed something for nothing or should have everything they want without paying for it.   That’s not a unique idea…it’s a lazy one!
god damn wonderful. good shit friend
not only is this a musical masterpiece but it's also masterful storytelling, I'll never understand how people can put this kind of meaning behind words while also make them rhyme, I've been listening since love music and it's been amazing watching the progression of your sound, amazing work as always
B E S T I A L !!
why doesn't anyone talk about how good this quartet is, I love these strings, thank you
Talented fellow
I can't belive they hired slender man to play that part!
incredible
1:36  Gasp 😮 he's British the worst fate anyone can indure
So good they made a part 3
<3
The guys a genius. Beethoven meets wutang meets black sabbath isnt even close to how good he is. I hope he keeps going. He will be one of the best musical artists ever of he does. Hes not far off already. We love you ren.
I love this! Especially it's the third part! ❤❤
holyyyyyy gave me goosebumps
Spread the good word of Ren. Amen. ❤
very impressiv again. i like the style of your videos and your singing even so i would whish for more songs probably with a shorter story telling part because your songs are wonderful
What an emotional impact, Ren. I want to praise your work but above all thank you for it. You're a gift.
Sounds very Hamilton. :)
Pretty cringe.

Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy 1 years old and his first words were "Mine, mine, gimme!" 2 years old he was walking, 3 years old walking quickly 4 years old he was running 'round the pavements of his city 5 years old and his daddy told him "Listen here, son You gotta learn to be a man, a man, he works for what he wants" 6 years old and he’s reading, writing, top of the bunch And when he's 7, his progression made him student number 1 8 years old and he’s praised for unusual grades 9, his parents pay for private school to nurturе the flame 10, 11, 12, 13, he ascеnds and ascends His daddy tells him "Son, money is the means to all ends" 14, solving complex mathematic equations At 15, IQ 150, still elevating 16, he develops complex software code That detects weaknesses in cyber security protocols 17, and he sells his vision keeping a share Not yet an adult, but he's practically a millionaire 18, and his daddy tells him "Now you're a man This world don't give a damn about you, so take all that you can" 19, he turns a profit stocks and shares invest in product 20, double-down deposits, 21, his income rockets 22, he learns that truth is just an obstacle to wealth If you manipulate the data, then a lie will sell itself 23, a life of luxury, crystal and cocaine 24, he makes the Forbes list, they're applauding his name 25, and his daddy tells him, "Listen here, son While you are sitting in that palace, that don't mean that you won" 26, a business shift, he switches business to arms He's 27, dealing nuclear and shells in Iran 28, inside the Senate money bought him a seat He's 29, a role of the council in the president's suite Now he’s 30, his daddy says "You're losing the race You're just a servant to the king, not even in second place" 31, a big maneuver for his daddy’s approval Moving imports over borders from the exports out of Cuba 32, moving grams, growing kilos to tonnes He's 33, filling warehouses with powder and guns 34, turf war with nobody to stop it Blind eye from the po-po inside of his pocket 35, he gets a call, "I'm sorry son It's your father, had a heart attack, I'm sorry, he’s gone" 36, getting pissed up, abusing his product 37, eyes glazed, disposition demonic 38, with a prostitute, a moment of passion Heating up a silver spoon and then chasing the dragon 39, getting reckless and hungry for power Daddy’s words still driving him to kill and devour He makes a move against the cartel, but the strategy's flawed They retaliate and leave him in a hospital ward A bullet buried in his vertebra and one in his leg The doctor sighs and says "I don’t think you’ll be walking again", fuck  Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy He was 40, and he cursed the words "Mine, mine, gimme" 41, he wasn’t walking, 42, not walking quickly 43, never running 'round the pavements of his city 44 inside a palace with a mountain of gold But those riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves Weighing heavy on his conscience is the value of gold Lamborghini for a life, trading money for souls Jimmy followed the code inside the land of the free Put your hand inside the cookie jar, take more than you need And his example is exaggerated versions of me And it's a version of him, and it's a version of she And it's a version of you, there’s no escaping the blame The way we live is parasitic, fuck the money and fame! Cut the music  This isn’t entertainment, this is real-life The way we live is lunacy, community, it declines We're hyperpolarized, we're always fighting, and we divide Truth is less important than the money that we design? Money's an invention, politics from our invention They all come from peoples' ideas, did I mention? Borders? An invention, law, and order fuel the tension That leads to people killing each other. My solution? Everything is subject to change We could build utopias if individuals were taught to use their brains But if we teach kids in school to always be sheep And put themselves before the herd if there's more money for me Then there’s no future I see, where the humans survive We're parasites inside a Petri dish with cannibal minds Mold will grow upon a surface, then consumes till it dies And our fate could be the same without this story for the wise 45, Jimmy comes home out of the rain Soaking wet upon a wheelchair, drinking again He is everything he wants, he has fortune and fame He’s a fortunate fool with an unfortunate fate With a 45 caliber aimed at his brain 45 - a fitting number, 'cause his age is the same Hears the words of his father; "It's such a damn shame" Then he presses on the trigger of a money game
Damn! Just came across this and it’s sooooo 🔥 bro!!! From the lyrics to the videos man I love it!! Camera guy is a beast.. Ren is Different and I Fukz With it..
This is probably my 15th time listening to this...maybe more. I lost count. It's all just so beautiful...and meaningful. The lyrics, the music and the brilliance of the way this was shot- everything about it is amazingly awesome. It's like coming back to watch a favorite movie over and over again. Thank you for making my brain happy.
OMIGOD ITS A PART 3 NQOEWGRNOIQRNMGORIQHNIOENPRHT
i love the music but why do i feel like i should be crying
shelby?
Man idk what it is about this song but this gives me chills evertime i watch it.
I will get hated for this but audio version would be cool without artistic pauses. The story told here is awesome, but when you only listen it those long pauses doesnt make sense (if you dont know how video goes). Still didnt know about this artist before YT moved me into this song. Keep going man! Respect!  Edit. Okay now as I have inspected Rens music and persona littlebit, I need to say he has been doing great shit lately. And now I like this version more 😂  I hope all the best for him for fight against health issues 🙏🙏
REN earned my respect the day I listen to his part 1 and this, THIS is MASTERPIECE
Absolutely beautiful. And you bring me to tears again........I don't have the ability to express my feelings about the world today, but you have a true talent. Love ya''ll.....
I've never believed in an artist more. Holy shit
Another masterpiece I see.
😮😮
Grieg's Piano Concerto variation? kkkkk
real art
Insanely brilliant.  I've just recently discovered your music and have fallen down the Ren hole. I'm obsessed with it all.
wow, ummm, that was so good. brought a tear to my eye. sad but well done.
Mae fy nhad yn hanu o Frymbo a bu farw yn ddiweddar. Mae eich cerddoriaeth wedi fy helpu cymaint yn yr amser anodd hwn. Nawr gadewch i ni weld a all unrhyw un ddyfalu pa iaith yw. Gobeithio bod hyn yn cyfieithu'n gywir!
I’ve watched this so many times and it still makes me cry. Ren is amazing. A true performance of art. I’m so blessed to have found Ren and his music. I can relate to his music so much unfortunately.
this is beautiful. Please never stop creating.
As an old fart aged 70,  and a lover of Rock music, I am impressed ... Great song writing ...
Was waiting for this for too long. And im glad its here
Yes Masterpiece collection 😅
Fckin Genius ;D;D;D
Absolutely incredible, powerful and will have influence in so many ways
I knew the strings were coming on . I saw him counting them in. I still cried.
unbelievable where a simple explanation from Luidy about how the capitalism works can take you
Omg
Very good, keep it up !
6;44 thats when i hit the subscribe button
Luigi S. Ren with another masterpiece 🥰
Is Ren a musician, or a poet, or an actor???                               YES                                ❤                                  🎉
1.5x this
I'm certain the 1911 was decommissioned or milled, and the ammo were duds, and in the final shot it looked a lot like the trigger and slide pin were removed. But fuck the scene with him waving it around toward the camera made me so anxious
is this about jimmy mr beast
this shit so majestic
Good song bro
wow
Comment 4 the algorithm
who would've thought that there will be a part 3 !
University courses devoted to single artists or works of art exist, Shakespeare, etc. It shan't be long before higher education recognizes how including Ren in their curriculum will benefit not only their students but society as a whole.
This guy is completely off the charts!
Ren is about to take over…so pleased you’ve got where you deserve to be and are getting recognised globally…don’t change a thing and keep doing what you do mate…class!!
Man this is pure personification of beauty, well done🎉
After this song, Ren donated all of his wealth to help poverty. As he isn't a hypocrite and stands by his own message.
OST for hitman blood money remastered?
🖤
Excellent and well needed Content! Keep it up Bro! Congrats on the #1 🐺🐺
This is an absolute masterpiece. Love from Kazakhstan♥
Genius Ren ✨❤️✨
tor me : younger verssion of Nick Cave... amazing
Wonderful video but it made me sad
Nothing hurts like the truth but human nature is a dragon not many can slay pain is too essential to the clarity we need but the more we feel it the more numb to it we all get I fear we are all doomed and it makes me angry because I know I was not strong enough to change anything no matter what I say I failed I hope someone else can do better than me
NICE
Ren, my friend, you are AMAZING, i love your work, so much emotion in what you do, truthful words that should wake up the lemmings of this world, people do not know how people like yourself and me have had to cope through life, you are REN! YOU ARE GENIUS! xxxxx
More people need to see this masterpiece
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Still HOT
I don’t have anything to say but I want to recommend this masterpiece to more people so I’m leaving a comment
Ren, I am an FM radio DJ in America. We need censored videos of these beautiful stories so we can share them with the world. The world needs you.
Clarity is painful to see! This is a masterpiece and I hope nothing ever spoils your style and what you have to share with the world.
Just wow!!
good stuff! keept it up! cheers mate!
!!!
Not often am I so moved.
Whoa!?
This is a performance, not just a music video. Thanks for this performance that will sometimes make my days better.
Here because of Justin Hawkins. Tuned in immediately.
Hell yeah! Love this
Wow..just wow.. respect from the Netherlands
Aiaiai
Loved it! Thank you again for doing what you can to make us not faceless.
I don't know what to say. Nothing about this song is a miss. It points out a very real problem in our society. The lyrics, acting, everything. it's perfect. I'm stunned. Bravo, Ren. You succeed again.
He’s so handsome, great voice too
Not enough words to describe the brilliance of this. Comment for algorithm. Ren is a genius.
Whoa🎉❤
Preaching!
It reminds me of she sells she shells on a sea shore
Articulation from copious angles, aiming right at the center of the web!
my god. just for the algorithm
This is art.
I expected a song, but I got a whole lifetime.
Boyinaband type beat
Brilliant... Just brilliant❤
Like a mad scientist... Brilliant
Great song hits hard 👍
What a fucking masterpiece once again
Ren............been saying for years that the people needed a voice thru the power of Music. Music connects with the humane in all of us. The soul that exudes from your words will open many minds. The methods you use to bring this about and the evils that you voice your wisdom over ..Will attract another darkness into your light. Beware .....
Ren & Sam, thoughtful, you are artists ❤
You need to collaborate with the amazing @mark grist
This is genius. This is deep af. This is truly artistry. Thank You x10000 ❤
LUGGY SEA SHELLS SEQUEL?! hype is real

Jesus fucking Christ 👏👏 Godlike poetry. You’re the king.
Respect!

Marvelous!
The Absolute pinnacle of British engineering!
Fresh of the dome, The hair I am trimmin', Hi there guys, My names Algo and I'm liking this Rhythm
"wanna shop for things displayed in this video?" Ummmm no what the heck is that and? Never saw it before! All respect and curiosity lost even before hearing/watching
Fuck This is good
beautiful
Work of art
5:52 Cello + Ren magic part 1 8:36 Cello + Ren magic part 2
Impressive
Its been a long time , long time  , since I have seen someone that can do what you do.
Omg love this guy 💕
Sooo when can we expect that Oprah interview. It would be amazing. We'll get you that interview with Oprah
this is impressive. I dont really have the words right now right after the video ended, but I hope people will actually truly understand what you mean to say with this.
thank you ren
This hits hard since I am 45.. but luckily "mine mine gimme" was never my motto and money was never a goal or a guide in my life that is why having no money is fine by me.. so fortunately I will live to see 46 and unfortunately I will see this world get messed up even more..  But those of us who think we are better than "Jimmy" and better than anyone else for not saying the word "gimme",  we still play the money game every single day even if we do not realize it..
the music hits hard and the message hits even harder, this is a masterpiece the entire world truly needs
Would be great if in the end he would get outside and start gardening.
New fan right here wow that's an experience just like hi ren an eye opener
Thomas Shelby making it out of Birmingham with this one!!!!
absolute poetry!
Shit just got real . Thank you very mutch Ren ❤
Your storytelling, music and cinematography is some of the most powerful I have ever seen. Truly!
Well....... That makes you think.
Awesome!!!
The ideas and lyrics are always creative but the same delivery, in this kind of rap style gets kind of boring (even if you change the tempo), especially when it drags on for 9 mins in one song. I just can't get to the end. I would suggest perhaps doing some colabs and making the videos shorter,  mix some things up.
muito brabo
@Renmakesmusic or anybody. Can anyone confirm that on sick boi pt2 @ 1:41 and 3:05 is Victus singing? Thanks.
❤ ❤ ❤ f*cking amazing
This is amazing. The song, the video, the atmosphere are top notch, incredible job.
Hi Ren. I have recently purchased your sick boy album and downloaded it also from your site. Just wanted to say that a 57 year old man appreciates your skill and hard work to produce your music and also your vision of your videos. Keep it up. Is there any release planned for your live recordings to be released. Murderer, chalk outlines etc. I would buy and I’m sure lots would. Keep it up
dude looks like he's trying to avoid the red right hand
Packgod collab.
niceeeeee
Been here since Blind eye, with Sam. Amazing how much you have pushed and grown despite everything. Another amazing money game as usual
Leaving a comment for the algorithm! This is the some of the most creative music!
Wow  ....just wow
im in love
Such a masterpiece
Brilliant
Your fire bro simply words young age
Dam im glad I found your music!!
Notice Jimmy only has contact with his Dad at the ages of 5, 13, 18, 25 and 30; i.e. "milestone" birthdays. It could be that his Dad only ever made contact with him on these days... no wonder he was desperate for his attention and approval.
What in the Eminem's flow Shakespeare's poetry, Tcaikovsky's music, Picky Blinder's looks...is going on???
somehow funny
My favourite parts are the sections with music. Would love to just have the track of the music without work 😂
From Tennessee, USA! What a lyrical genius! Keep it up!
Everyone has already expressed my feelings better than I can right now because I’m just in awe. I watched all three Money Game parts in a row and I’m stunned. You make me want to show everyone everything you create. I feel this desperate NEED to share your artistry, not just because you’re musically genius on so many levels (and I don’t use the term “genius” lightly!). It’s the music, the creativity, the visuals, the storytelling, the detail, the intelligence, the messages…I could go on and on. Your art, Ren, is so incredibly…human. I don’t know how to put it better. It describes, reflects, reveals, exposes, relates what it is to be human, and to live in the world we live in, with honesty, self awareness, and COMPASSION. It unites. Just…thank you so much for sharing your incredible gifts with the world because the world needs them. I know I do. Thank you to everyone who worked on this masterpiece. You are all brilliantly talented and you’ve created an incredible, important, impactful, and lasting piece of art. Again, thank you so much. ❤
Wow.
Algorithm juice, this is beyond for what i expected
fucking toxic of a dad that one is. because he is pushed to rise more and more and more and more in the way that is destructive, this 'jimmy' met a rather sad end...
whoa... i was prepared to make some fun of a mildly bad thing... I am not prepared to dissect a truly terrible thing. stop what you are doing. including breathing, if you don't mind.
gave me goosebump... masterpiece
Just in case anyone needed to know where Shakespeare went when he was reincarnated. Here you go.
Niiiiiice
I wish everyone would listen to this, REALLY listen. 👏🔥
"Magnificent...... magnificent... magnificent!!!!!! "
You're the only person that gives me hope for humanity. The fact that something as deep as this has the world over connecting to it is profound. It's almost like we all know we got it all wrong.
I remember when you where starting out on youtube this small channel, This hidden gem I just had found and you blew my mind. I kept spreading the word about this amazing artist I found probably didn't do alot. But here we are The hidden gem thats no more hidden, Amazing journey to been following for all of theese years. You helped me trough alot in life. And I hope it all comes back around to you at some point. I knew from the begining you were special such a unique voice and style that noone else had. I'm glad to see all the success coming your way because there will never be another Ren.
Every time I watch this, it gets better. Received my copy of the Sick Boi album today! So happy. Thank you so much Ren.
As a American this makes me Johnson stiff

Fookin Breeelant!
I just wanted to thank you. I really like the key chain.
Speechless ✨️🙌🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love your music Ren! Youve got a gift, dont ever stop! ❤
I dont have words to describe this
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Jesus! Powerful as always bro!
When I watch this time stops.
Simply amazing.  What can be more of a solution than a balanced education for each and everyone, not the school's education, but a real life education. I've made a plan for it in my channel and maybe, in some years, it could turn into reality.
i thought you were thomas shelby
I shouldnt like this its not my type of music but everything Ren produces is sheer fcuking genious.
Ayooooo
Yet again I need to fucking applaud your genius! So glad you are having the success you so richly deserve! I pray that you become fit and well enough to tour because I need to see you bring this shit to life live! Respect brother ❤️
Keep it real , keep it going young man . Great stuff 👍🏽 all the best
West End! Get this dude there. He would sell out broadway as well.
A legendary ending for a legendary series. Love it, great good, Ren been loving your music Hope you keep up the great work 😊
i LOVE it❤!!!
Love u!! I have mental health issues
Found out about you via money game part 2, and your music just keeps getting BETTER and BETTER! Keep it up. :D
Damn we got Money game 3 before GTA6
The dislikes are boys named jimmy.
I remember when I told him to make money game part 3 and he told me he wouldn't  fucking liar
tf there's no guitar playing here like in the thumbnail photo
wishing you all the very best Ren. well deserved.
Oh ren please don’t be a communist
Very much enjoying your groove brother I will be pushing REN IN THE USA ENJOY YOUR NEW FOUND FAME PLAY THEM CARDS RIGHT AND ENJOY
This needs more likes, come on
Shit
REN THE FOOKIN PEAKY BLINDERS.
wow.
F IMG broadway in NY is like we are over … this is their nirvana moment
i submit all 3 for the UN to watch/see/listen, on the record. . or at least in their comments. relevant
The start reminds me of the lyrics of Hi Ren "And I go by many names also, some people know me as hope. Some people know me as the voice that you hear when you loosen the noose on the rope"
Your songs always hit hard. This one gives goosebumps. The first money game was so good. This one is too.
Algcom
45mm is also aortic aneurysm  :)
wow , yet another masterpiece....i am 45 tomorrow 🤣.....it certainly is a money game. You Ren are the best thing to happen to music in a long time and i really do hope people learn from it. Peace and love bro ❤
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯wow no words
Brilliant.  😊
damn the piano man got 4 wives?
Algorithm got frozen after this 1
HOLY FUCKING SHIT
Вслушиваюсь в каждое слово, не всё пока понял, но это невероятный смысловой посыл. Спасибо за это творчество!
Loved it... 12 months and I'm hooked...
it's huge- algo!
Shommy Telby is killing it!
Genius
We all know what this means
First listen through I was hype. Now I'm sad.
POWRFUL!!!
Damn dude
How can people be smart about their means but not about their ends? Overspecialise and you breed in weakness.
Dang. Thomas Shelby has some crazy pen game
REN can say fuck but subtitles won’t write it ❤✌🏼🙏🏼Well done to REN and his team.
Ren the truth speaker, thank you
good
didnt hold merit coz id make u my bitch in 2 rounds
Just wow, this is beyond music!
I wonder when Eminem will see Ren.
I am greatful.
Stunning.
This is great  Im obsessed
Amazing song
Someone has probably already commented or thought this but … anyone reckon the prostitute’s (who Jimmy slept with) son or daughter, will show up in a future song? Who else thinks this would be epic?
So awesome!
Ren is the most captivating artist of all time with endless talent and a great heart 💙
What.a.masterpiece. 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
wow
The irony is this creates money and fame
Genius.
“It’s only when the last fish has been caught, the last tree chopped down, the last river poisoned, do we realise we can’t eat money.”
Imagine ren & Oliver anthony collab that would be sick
Incredible.
The melodic part is so heart breaking. Great work 🔥
Record labels and the music industry were infiltrated early in its beginnings by highly paid and powerful propagandists. The "Powers That Be" understood the power of music, frequencies and lyrics.   They can be used in some of the most powerful ways of persuasion.  Hence now days saying (making a deal with the devil)  The "devil" is (or WAS) the music industry.  They HAD control over what is mass produced and fed to the public population. These independent artist are only gaining popularity on the world wide stage due to social platforms. The VERY IMPORTANT voices of the majority of the population can find a stage to be heard now.  SUPPORT THESE INDEPENDENT ARTISTS.   It is VERY important that the majoritys voice is heard. It can and WILL influence our future and the history of civilizations.
Forever genuine forever real . Keep spreading the truth Ren the world is in need truth in the mirror. Stay well my friend 🙏🎤🎸🤟🇨🇦
I never knew cillian murphy was also a singer.
This is so fkn good. Just a side note though. We didnt waste that bottle of burbon for real did we? Course not.
That did not feel like a 9 minute 19 second video. I was gripped for the whole thing.
It’s been decades since I last bothered hearing the lyrics of a song, much less been so enthralled. This is art.
Ren is a fucking beast man. There's nothing he can't do. I don't think have heard such originality since....pfffft I don't even know when. I hope he has plans to write films or plays. Or even act. I truly believe that there's nothing this young man can't succeed at artistically. He deals with such heavy subject matter but makes sure us mere mortals understand lol.
This is so fucking good
Bravo !
Epic. Once again. Congrats! ! !
We`ve been waiting for such an artist far too long. We`re glad you`re here WITH US REN.
sadly to little people listen this masterpiece :(
leaving a comment so hopefully other people can see this.
This is too good! Amazing 👏
Mind blown.. get it.
The way you rhyme reminds me of lin manuel miranda. But with your own style and personality to blend it all together. Fucking masterclass art right here.
Everything you do is a poetic masterpiece!
🔥
GENIUS!!!!❤
This man should be cast for peaky blinders and it would be amazing to have him singing a song as it flashes between his plan unfolding, over throwing a rival gang and enjoying a early celebration to a plan well done.
Master piece.
👏👏👏
Young Cillian Murphy
Idc who says what … this man is in a league of his own, been listening to his music since waaaaay back 🫶🔥
You ARE absolutely  incredible ❤️!!!!!!!!!!   WOW, WOW, WOW. Every single thing I've heard of yours I'm amazed by. The very first thing I heard of yours was the song about a boy named screech Jenny and a boy named screech incredible and I've been hooked ever since on everything I've seen you do
Le clip est génial et on a compris le sujet avec le clip et le titre. 😁👍
The music is flipping beautiful and speaks to you on a different leave each time. Also the beginning of the video when  he's playing  piano.....twas a turn on from hell......I have no explanation for that ha but love the music!
This is so good ❤
clones, echoes, cycles, and everyone just keeps forgetting
Ironically, the video end with a Youtube ads of a guru telling you how to get rich. The f*cking irony.
I cannot stop watching this.  Everytime I notice something new. Amazing.
Cette musique est juste dingue de l'art a l'état pur merci ceci a depasser les frontières,  jecoute en france. ❤❤❤
Thomas Shelby?
All hail the algorithm. Hope this helps spread the fire. ❤
❤
OMG! 👌
Sold enough seashells on the seashore for a suit and a piano
for the algorithm
bro this is deep commentary and incredible art.
This is art, this is something beyond a song, this is something real
0:35 BRUUH, the camera movement is aaahhhh.. so good.
This is art
I didnt listen to it yet. But this id gonna be a masterpiece I swear
Love it
the Money Game leitmotif after Jimmy is put in the wheelchair got me going nuts
Man.  You make 9 minutes feel like only 2.  Brilliant.
Let's go.
I’m promoting myself to a huge air conditioner
Jesus Christ
When you first discovered Ren, his haunting lyrics, angelic singing voice, not yet widely known, you felt like you'd discovered something special. There are very few musical storytellers as unique as him, and fewer still talking about the underbelly of humanity, the way he does. Just chills...
holy shit
i need luigi to sing this
The way are societies function is unsustainable. Most people are unhappy in this consumerist mentality but none of us know how to get out of it and break the system.
Jesus christ please never stop creating materpeices like this, god dayum that camera work is amazing! THE Story, the connection, omg... IT"S CRAZY! i love it. (hope your okay though)  okay after watching it fully... spirits are now coming to our new lives at this point in the game. The, sociatal, degrade of our own minds has left in want, but the future is appointed to our every need, so pull together a bullet and a gun and hope it prays for your bleed. But forget that the brain is made of magic in the first place....
I've enjoyed your music for quite a while now but your video treatments are noteworthy for their artistry and concept. A throwback to when people actually put some effort and art into their music videos and it's really impressive seeing it again.  Was that all a single shot? Hard for me to say for sure due to a couple of spots where the camera does odd things, but even so - extremely long and clever takes in any case making great use of the set and cast.  All the more impressive. Some heavy shit too. Rock on Ren, Rock on.
Brilliant! Another masterpiece!😮❤❤❤❤
Has Ren’s  money been found?
Bravo 👏  @renmakesmusic always giving us the lyrics of life. 🖤
🔥
tommy shelby took a turn

Lyrical genius
Amazing
that was like the song "7 years" but on steroids
Wow everyone is else is leaving deep meaningful comments while I’m waiting here for someone to make Luigi sing it
Kp ob jemand Mein Kommentar auf deutsch liest aber dieser Künstler ist einer der besten unserer Zeit danke dafür
This is insane, but masterpiece for sure!!!  I lost my words.
Brilliant. Music, literature, commentary, cinema just everything.
Ren is the genre
Ic mai laif😂❤❤❤❤
Amazing story telling, lyrics, and music video!
This is just brilliant! Once again Ren excels!
"We're parasites in side a petridish  With cannibal minds Mould grows upon a surface it consumes till it dies And our fate could be the same" we got the ability to think, please, please, please start to do so... Wake up!
A lyrical poet of the 21st century. Kudos to you and the fam, Ren.
Frighteningly ingenious.
Absolutely fantastic, no more needs to be said, it’s  all in the video.
fuck.....thia ia a masterpiece
fuck.....thia ia a masterpiece
Just when I thought you couldn’t get any better, wow, I take my hat of to you so much truth it hurts
Goose bumps all over my body 🙏
Thank you for this masterpiece
So it's been two weeks now that I'm watching different reactors reacting to this video.  And every time I'm catching myself ignoring the actual reaction and watching the small video they show there alongside.  I even somehow get upset when they pause the video and talk. 😂 It's very interesting for me how people react, what they feel about it, yet I can't take my eyes off the actual MG video. That's why I'm here once again, to enjoy it fully in HD rather than be distracted periodically. 😆  P.S. 🧡
this is art
.
Leaving a comment for the algorithm. u good
Well done Ren. Wish you all the Best. Thanks for sharing your talent.
Dude that's amazing!!!! There was a time when I left a comment under one of your old videos and you gave me an advice for my question so I still remember it! Your art is so deep man!!!
So good, love this one!
Spectacular is an understatement
Big fan from Philippines ❤
What a masterpiece
Came for the memes, stayed for the amazing beat and lyrics.
The cinematography is brilliant!
Ren for the next Bond Song?
Algorithm manipulation is working. Let me help
The cinematography with this one is AMAZING! Good job man, you've earned everything you got!
This is so good it's unreal.
This has got the be the smartest piece of media I have ever seen. Kudos! Amazingly done! Very thought-provoking stuff!
I really liked it in a way that I can't explain very well... the drama, the brakes associated with the lyric, or I'd say poetry? The clip was very well done too. Anyway, thank you Ren for share to us this pece of art.
My 13 year old son loves him!
Absolutely class listened every day since it come out.
❤❤❤ BRILLIANT !!!! This guy is not a singer, he is umbelievable !!!!!!!!! He is even more than a poet !  Thanks for all 😉!!!!!!  You're giving us TRUTH 😢 and HOPE 😊!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If Thommy Shelby write a song
Every teenager need to hear this
Радиотапок, Пушной, челлендж на кавер
Damn Thomas Shelby won’t stop surprising me
luigi taught me capitalism
i send this to everyone i know
So ridiculously talented. Visionary for real
Well done Ren , what a unique talent , Your success is richly deserved.
You do not speak in images but in ideas that coalesce as stories.  Thank you for elevating the game.  You are long overdue.  Please keep moving forward.  Just brilliant.
Moni
Thomas Shelby did made a great music video.
Fantastico
honestly for a second i thaught i'm in dark web it was better than 10 movies i watch recently
13 days passed and i watched this like 50 times already. Production and creativity on this is crazy. Well deserved Nr.1 album.
i like that when thomas shelby start wooo
Oxi, o Thomas Shelby tá fazendo música agora? Kkkkkkkk
Pure art
wow
Speaking philosophy and logical insights through form of melody and art. Truly a Prodigy of his work
so good job
Biggest emotionnal kick since a while
Bravo !
I believe this is a big investment into the future minds
Stunning piece of art.
masterpiece
you are a great artist man
So great to see you finally getting the recognition you so hugely deserve!
boost
Shook
Holy F.  That was one of the most important pieces of art I have ever seen.  Did I really just see the last 100 years of music and moving image put together? From silent films to MJ to Kendrick lamar, that was just breathtaking.
An Easter egg i haven't seen mentioned yet is how Jimmy sold "shells" to Iran
This is musical history.
This man has just played out my entire thoughts on society, where it is and where it could be if we stopped focusing on the wrong things, all in a music video. Absolute Masterpiece.
Wow! I think you've invented a new art form. Amazing Ren!
That mask costume I think symbolizes a hangman or the victim or both and the suit symbolizes corporate. so we either victims or perpetrators? Jeez Ren.
🫡✨❤
★ ★ ★ ★ ★ - "PERFECTION" ~ ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I am not sure if I ever commented on a YouTube video before, but like many others, I was struck by the craft in this short film and had to stop to applaud it. Unlike Ren I do not have the ability to find words to describe what I feel and string it into sentences that are so powerful, honest and meaningful at the same time. Stories shape humanity so here I am commenting to feed the algorithm that I despise so much living in a world that is upside down. Perhaps what makes Ren's art stand out so much is that it is clearly driven by a message encapsulated by beautiful lyrics and music. In this cacophony of empty songs and videos omnipresent on the internet, it is a rarity. Dark and beautiful. If I were in a theatre that would be a standing ovation from me.
Helping with the algorithm but so good
Amazing aa usual
😮😮 this song is a very nice 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Cannot convey the strength of this in words other than to express that it reaches through the numbing void of misinformation, disinformation and disillusionment - Ren your wholeheartedness is formidably powerful, while at the same time, gently  touching for those that feel unheard - brings some of the fire back in to challenge the fear that's destroying humans and the world we are meant to be caring for. You literally rock the foundations, and role away the stone covering the apathy.
lovely
its so bad delete plesae
crazy <3
Is it just me or the quality of Ren's music videos increases exponentially every time?
As always, blown away
Peak
Director deserves a lot of credit too
Using this as interlude in all meetings to add to the fanbase 😁 Want a break? Sure, let me put on some music for you... 🥸
He`s a brilliant masterpiece/////
Beautiful ….
This is going straight to the work playlist.  Be safe out there my dude
I am so proud of you, Ren and making it to number 1. You so deserve it!!!  I know what it's like being chronically ill and that's what makes it even more impressive. You're an amazing artist and human being ❤❤
So fucking good.
Wow.
I love this so much!! It is music and a message that burrows inside of me and leaves me thinking about the world! #genius
Thomas Shelby sang, cool 😎
👊👑
Is this the guy from peaky blinders😅
This Was Utter Pish But You Will All Kiss His Arse. Enjoy Yourselves.
Brilliant 🔥thank you
🔥🔥🔥
Thomas Shelby
Amazing!
Top of my bucket list, seeing Ren in concert. 🤞 He’s just amazing.
A+, bravo.
His level of creativity with a depth of intelligence and moral clarity is a mind-blowing package. I’m impressed beyond words.
Savant. Pure art. Ren's musical creations are by far some of the most golden messages. 🖤 this one 👏👏👏
awful, why was I recommended this shit?
Genius. Nuff said for the algorithm. Props to knox.
Great message but still nothing tops money game 2
All hail the algorithm.
Best thing I’ve seen on YouTube hands down
Wow. So good.
dont play with guns!
Bravo!
I am an old woman, this young man knows how it is. Love you Ren.
You did it, you did it independently. ❤
Holy crap dude. You did it again. Please don't stop showcasing your unique style and vision.
...osz ty kur..a mistrzu... wlazłeś m ido głowy od wystąpień ulicznych później, blind eye! ... teraz jestem tu  i widzę więcej, robisz więcej, robisz piękno trudne do opisania w tych czasach  dziękuję, że mogłem to zobaczyć  dziękuję, że jestem  dziękuję, że jesteś  dziękuję  jestem wdzięczny za możliwość doświadczania chwili obecnej  mam nadzieję, że mój syn zrozumie   dla Kacpra  tata
Wow, this is a good piece of work and art. Congrats for making such a great song and videoclip <3
So glad Mr Hawkins made me aware of this wonderful talent ⭐️
Unique and Fantastic
Kids a genius
On life 🤞🏾
Once again brother you knock it out the park.
I'm speechless. This is a Masterpiece.
The video concepts and directing are as good as the rhymes, lyrics, melodies, and arrangements are.
🐐🐐
this masterpiece have a stunning futur.
Made it through the Algorithm! ❤🎉
Speachless
Wow pretty good 👍
This is great, and I do like Justin Hawkin's. Idea of having Ren as the new James Bond!
Hey Ren. My birthday is coming soon and I want to ask if you can make a crappy Halloween song bc it’s coming soon(not gonna happen but I like foolin around)😊
To put it very simple: Jimmy was born greedy His father fueled his greed When his father died, Jimmy lost control and his hunger for power became starvation influenced by substance use Jimmy overcalculated and got shot, becoming paralysed in the legs Then he realises he lost one of the thing that he enjoyed, walking and running (first verses versus verses after he got shot) He then realises money/physical wealth has no value and what matters are life experiences (Lamborghini for a life, trading money for souls)  This makes him realise he has no life, which puts him in depression and makes him pull the trigger (of the money game, which revealed itself as his life) [my interpretation]   To this there are also more things to consider: -"Jimmy's life is an exaggerated version of (all of us)" , showing we are all greedy at some point (else the world would be an utopia "We could build utopias if individuals were taught to use their brains" meaning it would be paradise on earth and our greed comes from our stupidity (drugs and our tendency to oversatisfy ourselves just because we can)   -interestingy, his mother is never spoken of, and this could be developed in future Ren's songs, or his father could have been just the rappresentation of the rational money game (that died from spontaneous drug usage degenerating into the cartel's attack, and so he always was an inner voice of his, but this is just a theory and interpretation)
i cant help but to sing, " He's 30. His daddy says, "You're losing the race. Your Youtube views lower than your calorie intake.""
A THIRD!??
Truly breathtaking /holding video and N all around piece of art!  Hands up who spotted both Sack Man and The Beano book on the computer desk with the Rubik Cube? 😂👏
Wow
One word, masterpiece.
I'd love a Ren musical.
Depressing but good.
Probably the best i've heard since Hi Ren.   Ren, you are a genius, and i really fucking mean it. This isnt just a good song, its an incredible song, and incredible performance, and an incredible delivery. What amazes me the most and gives me to think that you are one of the greatest artist since the turn of the century and a genius, it is not the your knowledge about music, it is the fact that you dont give a crap about it, break every scheme and still triumph like no one did.   Its crystal clear that you know how the music industry works, what formulas, melodies work the best, the "formula" to success. Yet, you dont give a damn about it, you morph it into your own creation, your own signature.   On 5:55, the melody you use works perfectly, its amazing, its so touching, nostalgic and sad, and instead of squeeze out everything you can, you just stopped. You could easily have let the melody go on and on till the end, and armonically it would sound amazing, leaving us with a fullfillment sensation. But no, thats not Ren. You go out to stop it, even if it breaks the melody and the armony, you do it anyway because there's a message you want to convey, theres a mark, a signature, you want to leave, the "Ren signature". And even though you broke the armony several times, even though you left us with a void sensation cause the melody stops, you still succeded. Cause thats Ren, even against all odds, even though you didnt have a discographic on your back, or unlimited budget, you rose up to number 2 and probably number 1 in the charts, and to be able to achieve all of this, it is what i would call someone a genius. And you truly are.    Apart from my own analysis of the song and how it succeded even when theoretically shouldnt, I gotta say, there hasnt been a single song I disliked since I listened to Hi Ren, not even one.   Most people got their one hit and then dont reach the expectations or just crumble after their one hit. But you? Yes, Hi Ren was the masterpiece that got you on the spotlight, but every song, before and after Hi Ren has been at least equally or close to the quality of your "one hit". Congrats, Ren, you deserve it all. Much love and support from Argentina <3
MASTERPIECES!
❤
This is more than just music. This is philosophy and poetry all at once...
Strong Peaky blinders vibes
PUMPED to watch this for the like 10th time!!
"Cillian Murphy spits on my life"
This is actually madness on how true it is in real life. The most clever lyrics in modern music!
Oh my gooood, such rollercoaster, I'm completely speechless, kudos from italy!
Thanks again Ren for helping in a time of need.
45 triggers for game
Came by this tune after Justin hawkins rides again review and I've got to say this is one of the best written songs I've heard and the accompanying video is a better... well done lad amazing job👌👏👏👏👏
Bro the camera work on this video is so cool, it really makes my skin crawl 🤯
awesome, heart-attacking story, ren, it put goosebumps all over me - this is NOT the end <3
I got led here by @JustinHawkinsRidesAgain and Im absolutley gobsmacked at this kids artistry.  Like, Prince level artistry.  I sincerely hope that he keeps making art and that the "industry" doesnt get ahold of him; eating him whole and spitting him back out like so many others.  Long live Ren!
Die Geschichte, die Kameraführung, die Abbrüche und Pausen, der Songtext, diese Stimme.  Das genialste, was meine Augen jemals sehen durften. Danke ❤
This is just a brilliant artist, I've never seen anything so good and comparable!
Best I've ever saw ❤
Broadway Hip-hop, Ren u created a new Genre of Music
I wouldnt call this a song. Its more like a play. Which means its eligible to win a grammy in multiple categories. Oscar, maybe not. As it hasnt been in theatres or can be in theatres. It also doesnt qualify as a movie so that doesnt work. But hell, it needs some kind of award
Violets Tale was the first video i was looking and it left me speechless i normaly listen to punk, ska and alternative but Ren is an absolut Genius and got me with the first chord. Hi Ren is my favorit just watch all the reaction videos to get an answer. Cant discribe it in words because my writing in english is to bad for that. I am German but understand every single word and the message behind.thx Ren  hope there will be a chance to order the new album with paypal.  Thank you for your music /art ...Genial
Thx Ren!!! LG Ela
Super Nova Child, 2020 was the beginning!
First time hearing/seeing Ren.. Thrilled he's standing where he is and amplifying his thoughts.
Ok, a young artist spotted the problem again and stated it well. But perhaps a more important move is suggesting a solution. I’m an aging white man and I know I’m probably the problem. But nihilism won’t solve it
what a fkin legend
Amazing!
This is incredibly powerful and it really is the truth about how life is.
i have to comment for the algorithm
What have I just witnessed. My God.
Oh! I got a notification that my physical copy of Sick Boi has shipped! I'm in the US so, I wasn't expecting it so early! Thanks Ren and everyone working on the album!
I love that I can see things that Ren and Sam learned about their own art forms along this journey that they've been on together. This really feels like a Masterpiece for both of them. Can we get a feature length production out of you two? Like a full on musical...you know you can do it. You've proven that like a dozen times already.
Try Vivaldi
Our Banksy of beats and word.
that intro is from the moonlight sonata third movement. a bit simplified but still quite cool he drew inspiration from there
Ok WOW. Pure heart and talent
SALAMANCA MONEY SALAMANCA BLOOD!
Кровосток - биография (режиссёрская версия)
Thank you Ren, just thank you. Truth hurts but I like you you say it, your a great poet.
is not just the song, is like see the movie of your life, so artistic and powerful the message
MASTERPIECE! Ren's a genius! A modern day poet!
Absolute Masterpiece
I bet I've listened to this masterpiece 50 times. And 50 times, the flow of Ren's voice with that piano score has given me chills. I'm sure my Echo is tired of me saying... Echo, Can you restart that song! ❤❤❤
Why is no one taking about the genius that is was the line “my solution? *picks up and loads gun* (just end it)”  the just end it is implied but it rhymes and it was so fucking cool
From Hi Ren's release to MG3, watching this artist blow up has been an incredible journey. So excited to see what the future holds for us
jimmy? as in Mr Beast? 💀
Lyrics:  [Verse 1] Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy 1 years old and his first words were "Mine, mine, gimme!" 2 years old he was walking, 3 years old walking quickly 4 years old he was running 'round the pavements of his city 5 years old and his daddy told him "Listen here, son You gotta learn to be a man, a man, he works for what he wants" 6 years old and he’s reading, writing, top of the bunch And when he's 7, his progression made him student number 1 8 years old and he’s praised for unusual grades 9, his parents pay for private school to nurturе the flame 10, 11, 12, 13, he ascеnds and ascends His daddy tells him "Son, money is the means to all ends" 14, solving complex mathematic equations At 15, IQ 150, still elevating 16, he develops complex software code That detects weaknesses in cyber security protocols 17, and he sells his vision keeping a share Not yet an adult, but he's practically a millionaire 18, and his daddy tells him "Now you're a man This world don't give a damn about you, so take all that you can" 19, he turns a profit stocks and shares invest in product 20, double-down deposits, 21, his income rockets 22, he learns that truth is just an obstacle to wealth If you manipulate the data, then a lie will sell itself 23, a life of luxury, crystal and cocaine 24, he makes the Forbes list, they're applauding his name 25, and his daddy tells him, "Listen here, son While you are sitting in that palace, that don't mean that you won" 26, a business shift, he switches business to arms He's 27, dealing nuclear and shells in Iran 28, inside the Senate money bought him a seat He's 29, a role of the council in the president's suite Now he’s 30, his daddy says "You're losing the race You're just a servant to the king, not even in second place" 31, a big maneuver for his daddy’s approval Moving imports over borders from the exports out of Cuba 32, moving grams, growing kilos to tonnes He's 33, filling warehouses with powder and guns 34, turf war with nobody to stop it Blind eye from the po-po inside of his pocket 35, he gets a call, "I'm sorry son It's your father, had a heart attack, I'm sorry, he’s gone" 36, getting pissed up, abusing his product 37, eyes glazed, disposition demonic 38, with a prostitute, a moment of passion Heating up a silver spoon and then chasing the dragon 39, getting reckless and hungry for power Daddy’s words still driving him to kill and devour He makes a move against the cartel, but the strategy's flawed They retaliate and leave him in a hospital ward A bullet buried in his vertebra and one in his leg The doctor sighs and says "I don’t think you’ll be walking again", fuck You might also like Uninvited Ren Sick Boi, Pt. 2 Ren Seven Sins Ren [Verse 2] Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy He was 40, and he cursed the words "Mine, mine, gimme" 41, he wasn’t walking, 42, not walking quickly 43, never running 'round the pavements of his city 44 inside a palace with a mountain of gold But those riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves Weighing heavy on his conscience is the value of gold Lamborghini for a life, trading money for souls Jimmy followed the code inside the land of the free Put your hand inside the cookie jar, take more than you need And his example is exaggerated versions of me And it's a version of him, and it's a version of she And it's a version of you, there’s no escaping the blame The way we live is parasitic, fuck the money and fame! Cut the music!  [Verse 3] This isn’t entertainment, this is real-life The way we live is lunacy, community, it declines We're hyperpolarized, we're always fighting, and we divide Truth is less important than the money that we design? Money's an invention, politics from our invention They all come from peoples' ideas, did I mention? Borders? An invention, law, and order fuel the tension That leads to people killing each other. My solution? Everything is subject to change We could build utopias if individuals were taught to use their brains But if we teach kids in school to always be sheep And put themselves before the herd if there's more money for me Then there’s no future I see, where the humans survive We're parasites inside a Petri dish with cannibal minds Mold will grow upon a surface, then consumes till it dies And our fate could be the same without this story for the wise [Outro] 45, Jimmy comes home out of the rain Soaking wet upon a wheelchair, drinking again He is everything he wants, he has fortune and fame He’s a fortunate fool with an unfortunate fate With a 45 caliber aimed at his brain 45 - a fitting number, 'cause his age is the same Hears the words of his father; "It's such a damn shame" Then he presses on the trigger of a money game
Jesus atheist Christ. Newly discovered this beautiful artist speaking facts in rhyme and reality
Damn
Killian's lost the plot.
This piece of art always reminds me that we are so lucky to be in the UK and not the US. Because suicides would definitely rocket if we had legal access to guns. It's one trigger...one that ypu can't take back. If we did I definitely wouldn't be here, often it's a cry for help. But a gun is a noose you can't undo. Maybe Ren wouldn't be here if he had a gun, and that would have been the biggest loss to the world,  not just to music. 💖💖
Leaving a comment for the algorithm. This is not a MASTERPIECE, this is more than MASTERPIECE
incredible, this story tail goddes 😍
Absolutely amazing!
3:00
Someone get Ren on peaky blinders for god sakes.....Dudes seems like a natural perfect fit for a character on that show before it ends. Esme shelby-lees brother?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🩸✨
Awesome...just Awesome.
amazing
I normally don't comment, but after watching so much of Ren's work I'm a complete fan. This video is a true work of art. "This is real life" Thanks Ren for all your work
HOLYYYYYYYYYY FUCKKKKKKKK
Jaw dropping talent...😧
I'm ashamed I've never heard of you before. This is the first piece of your work I've viewed and it's a masterpiece.
Ależ to jest dobre!!
In a world that has desensitized me and I myself from being moved. This gave me goosebumps. Amazing 👏 ❤
Oh my God just witnessed greatness
doesnt half go on, does it?
Amazing! love you ren ❤❤, greetings from the netherlands 🇳🇱
SEASHELLS SEASHELLS ON A SEASHORE
This is AMAZING!!!
This is the first music video I've actually properly watched for years absolutely amazing!
oly moly
V
Masterpiece ❤
Magically, somehow, Youtube's algorithm (and my curiosity) brought me here. First time I'd heard about Ren, first time listening..and I have goosebumps! This is beyond. Just awesome.
masterpice
MV of the year. No contest.
This dude is something special ❤
This is a great poem. Your performance brought power to the spoken word.
Has anyone else been utterly incapable of not  continually re-watching  this masterpiece?  😮  Art in it’s purest form with its rawest delivery and accompaniment.  Bravo and cheers 🥂
This is talent man
This is stupid whoever thinks otherwise is also uneducated and don’t know what true music is
Amazing talent Ren. Sending love from Anglesey ❤
For 9 minutes i was jimmy. A story of when i ruled the world.
Esto es una joya
Absolutely my new obsession.
Oh my God. Again you've brought me to tears, Ren. Not just the first time that I heard this song but watching that video for the first time. It gives me goosebumps. The amount of artistry and design and intelligence and insightfulness in this is just unreal. You are not just a musical artist, you are a multifaceted performance artist who uses every sense to create an experience for your audience.   I just can't wait for the broader world to wake up to your genius.
fire
You look like a pride parade
It’s a masterpiece
Lookin dapper bro.  You making a better world somewhere?
Very Few Storytellers & Musicians can make you think the way Ren can. And I guess this is a fitting end for all Money Games in the World...the music stops& ends in a bullet& million regrets.  It's a Masterpiece Ren&Sam. Love from a  jaded Indian.
…the gun jammed, can’t wait for pt4
Beautiful
Good stuff
Comment for the algorithm. Kills it
It seems so long since we've had someone in music stand out like this.
This is incredible. Your music is eye opening and we need more 👏
Love the man's music
This Is masterpiece
The level of EVERYTHING presented here is stellar. I legitimately cannot start to put into words the brilliance I just witnessed. And all with such felt relevance. So moving...
mad fuckin' genius
truly amazing!
The layers in this are incredible. Outstanding stuff!
Ren > Everything
Wow just wow!! 😮 every single raw second of it!! Wow!!
I’ve watched this in itself plus through numerous reactions and I came back to watch again…. One word MASTERPIECE ❤️
This is amazing
My god this was fantastic to watch! It was only 9 minutes and 19 seconds, but it felt like I just watched a movie!
You mention inventions like borders and laws. When I was young (like 13) I felt the same about everything you said. That would be about 40 years ago. There are lots of inventions, and on the scales the good far outweigh the bad. So why select inventions and try to make people sad? Wouldn't it be better to create a division, seperating great minds from fools and big infants? We have many many great inventions that propelled civilisations, but you won't metion that because it don't fill your vocation. Anyhow and anyway you are king for today, just remember every time you attack, the words you say. There is truth but subjective, paralyezed and infective, introspective based on your truth that's never neglected, and on and on this story will go, when you shine a light always remember, these stories you told. Tell one side of an ancient story of glory,  ancient Greeks fighting off Persian hordes of fury. Or when Saint Edmund stood against the viking invaders, got an arrow through his heart, there are many occasions, So remember when you think that although these stories are old, underneath therein lies many stories, to, be, told..
Thanks youtube for this video... Ren.. you're legend...
Came for the memes stayed for the song
I love how this is his dark Ren character from Hi Ren, speaking in exactly the same way, exactly the same confidence and inflection, like an overseer that has seen it all before and knows the unchangeable outcome.... At the start.
You deserve succes mate, this is great songwriting
Amazing buddy just amazing
Ren and Samuel got money game alright...frugal cheddar spent on this video but FIRKIN PRICELESS results!! Great Part Trois song dude. Much love from Sunny Southport man.
Just WOW…. This was BRILLIANT!
Leaving a comment for the algorithm. This is a MASTERPIECE!!
I am now convinced that Money Game will be endless until there's a "Money Game End" that comes out  mini edit: but it never will, because the game will always continue, or perhaps farce is a better term
poggies
10/10
I have literally goose bumps all over my body listening to this. The emotion in just the opening piano is breath taking. Then you move into the actual song lyrics and it's bone chilling good!
Such a brilliant song. 👏  good work Ren
It would be awesome to see a collaboration between Ren and Bo Burnham
Love. <3
You didn't just blow it out of the park, you blew it out of the universe.
Omg this tell you about how money is shit❤ I already knew all this and I’m glad someone is sharing it though a form of music
it sounds horrible  but the message is nice
nice style, reminds me of peaky blinders
Also, can we get like an all-instrumental version of just the strings? Holy hell are they breathtakingly gorgeous. I'm assuming Ren wrote the arrangement, but if he didn't, whoever did is also brilliant.
Jesus Ren, Love to see you climb as you raise the game. This steep incline got people knowing your name. and they cant deny you're claim to fame. Its not your fault that when you walk by you leave prints in the asphalt!
wtf is this shit? :D
REN DO A CHRISTMAS SONGGGGGG 🎄
i thought he was thomas shelby at first
Tommy fucking Shelby 🥃🚬
Now we must applaud  and appreciated we know it. Ren is a singer rapper a modern  day poet. Without a doubt or a blink i am captivated to think the way his words twist and turns he is a new age Rabbie Burns.
This trilogy is simply the most profound piece of musical art ever produced .
Proud OF you Brother 🎉 congrats ON everything you have created for The World to connet 2.
Amazing I hope more people see this
masterpiece
Holy fuck mate You're getting better and better, can't believe it. Cheers from Poland, i hope someday I'm gonna hear You live! All the best!
Never heard of him. Was completely ready to hate it, because everyone else said he’s great……. Not that my opinion means sh*t, but this was really impressive.
Wow, wise way way way beyond his years.
Lyrical genius 🙌🙏 ❤
WOW! You are a modern day Shakespeare! How many takes did this take you? This is unbelievable!
This song is amazing I've listened to it on repeat for nearly a week
AMAZING work!!
You're insane man, you probably already touched  many lives in a really, really good way, you're awesome!
Is there an instrumental?
this is giving me  Kaizers Orchestra vibes :D great stuff Ren! :D
God damn! So good!
this music video is sick
This is amazing. I wish I could work with Ren. Wish he could give me feedback on my beats.
What a performance. No one is doing what you do. And every time it’s interesting and fresh. Hope you get all the rewards and support you need to continue following you dreams and talent as long as you wish. Much love ❤
Whatever you say Cillian Murphy
I heard this song in treatment.
Ren, it is about you too: "There he goes. One of God's own prototypes. A high-powered mutant of some kind never even considered for mass production. Too weird to live, and too rare to die." (c)  Hunter S. Thompson, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
No matter how hard I try, I can't stop listening to Ren 👏
Unbelievable 🙏🏼
this is absolutely beautiful
Could we get some rap similar to Illist of our time or The Hunger from Ren with classical instruments for the beat?
What a gift this man is. Wake up people!! Nothing you can buy in this world will give you the satisfaction you think it will compared to helping someone. Helping someone in need or suffering and seeing that relief you were able to provide could ever be matched. Try it!! Thank you ren for your unique masterpieces!!
It doesn't matter how many times I watch this. When Rens voice cracks with emotion at the end  its like a kick to the stomach. I watched with my mum, who normally only listens to classical, and we sobbed our hearts out. That ending, is never going to not get me.💕💕
yup...
Ren makes masterpieces
Why did you load so many rounds into the magazine, if you only needed one?
If REN doesn’t get nominated and win an Ivor Novello for this masterpiece I’ll be mightily disappointed.
😶 Speechless 🤯 👏🔥🔥🔥
fire wow thanks
💯💯
You need TRUE faith in Jesus to MOVE BEYOND THE MONEY GAME and never lose hope even unto death..
AYYY
Jesus 😭😭😭
Extremely brilliant, I love you man. I'm 51. You're such a wise guy. Keep fighting ❤️😊💪👍
This is horrible. It its truth, but still horrible. #SaveOurSouls
You are such a beauty
Fantastic work, brilliant way to express something we in the West all know or grow to understand. Cheers
Absolute masterpiece. This is more than a music video. This is more than a song. This is the best video I've EVER seen on YouTube. By far.
Ren ur linke my Inspiration since / sins Trick the FOX.... yatorayuki insta and upcoming "Colored Foxxes"   Romaix safed me to, alt of Times   Without real Kontext,  i know mate
"Oh rain, rain, rain - a storm it comes our way... But point the mirror at ourselves, we're all part of this old money game." So the question remains, fellow Renegades - how do we break free? Can we stop playing the game? Or can we change the rules? I don't have any answers - just many, many questions.
There are plenty of talented people in the world but Ren is playing 4D chess.
Brilliant!!!
🕸
Jesus loves you Ren.
COMMENTING TO BOOST, WONDERFUL JOB REN! TRUE ARTIST!

FOR THE ALGORITHMEN
Yoooo absolutely a cinematic masterpiece. I love your storytelling
Every time I hear this, I think of the Bill and Ted movie and how their song was supposed to unite the world. I believe Ren is the real Wyld Stallyn that will unite the world.

You've backed yourself into a corner now mate,..they're gonna' eat you from the arse up,..you've kicked a hornets nest and that buzzing noise your hearing will be your demise soon
Favourite xxx❤
Ren's all: "Thanks for coming to my TED Talk."
About to make a Hopsin series just a fire! Keep it up
so.... poetry with piano? not music
Thank you algorhythm
Right at 6:09.... The shot that instantly pulls at the heartstrings. Ren understands his power. Sam understands Ren's power. That singular moment is everything.
millennials doesn't understand difference between music and complaining. this is nothing else than a whining.
Another masterpiece Ren congratulation on number one album in UK well deserved!
w series
best story teller /song writer in 30 years.
ALL MY FELLAS WE UP 🔥🗣️🗣️🗣️🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝
My mrs doesn’t like Ren,  I’ve packed her bags.   I don’t need that level of incompetence in my life.  Another masterclass performance by Ren 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
The 1st time I heard this as soon as you started singing I cried my eyes out. Money game 1, 2 & 3.there is NOTHING like it. Oh. except more of your songs. Fuck Ren, you really touch my soul.
Ren, you really are one of the best storytellers of our time.
I'm sorry that I haven't been along the journey with you for years but boy am I glad to have stumbled upon you. Been listening to all your songs for the last few weeks now - what a f*cking artist. Lyrically astonishing. Poetically mindblowing. Painting pictures woth your songs.  Humbled to witness your creations. Thank you 🤝🏻
Art.
This is musical art at it's finest.
I love your music ren. "Simply Genius".
Bendigedig a sobreiddiol ar yr un pryd. Wonderful and sobering at the same time. Here is a message for our times. An urgent message...to stop the blame and to look within. To take responsibility for our share of the problem. To free ourselves. Ren truly is - in the fullest sense of the word - the bard of our times. Stunning work.
BRILLIANT ❤❤❤❤
Chaotically beautiful!
Give this man a grammy 🎉 this is absolutely beautiful 😢❤
SO FKING HEAVY!
I didn't know Thomas Shelby were a good singer
Just sell some shells dude
Er ist und er bleibt ein absolutes Ausnahmetalent.
Never heard about Ren before like 15 mins ago. Masterpiece. one of the best  songs i have ever heard. i thought a 9 minute song would be long and boring. engaging all the way through!
Fuck....... that's heavy. Left me in tears. #Truth
I aint even got words with my mixed emotions. Legendary bro
Ren, you have the Midas touch. I remember when you only had less than 1,000 views. Now we’re sitting above a cool Million.! ❤🎉
To say that i didn't  know about  this man 3 months ago ia a crime...Since then  i listen  to him every  day...unbelievable..one of a kind..please Ren dont ever change ..stay independent dont let this greedy music  industry  try to steal your  talent..Create  music from your  hart and u always will  be loved and appreciated..
The world needs this NOW. Thank you Ren ❤
❤🍻🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿😎🤙
I sincerely just want to appreciate this masterpiece and thank the gods for allowing me to discover ren. You're a Genius man! probably know this already but your genius is one I feel blessed to be able to meet and appreciate. Keep doing what you're doing man you have one new person anticipating all your releases.
❤❤❤
<3
ridiculous talent
You are beyond gifted.   Thank you Ren
Sitting here in silence 10 minutes after the video ended. Phenomenal.
The video and song is a masterpiece in all ways cant wait for more masterpieces from you Ren
Music is Beautiful! We interpret music in many different ways.
Is there a chance you will come in concert to the U.S.?
Man. I can listen to this song every day. You guys are on your way up that’s for sure. Never listened or really watched music until about two months ago when I accidentally listened to Hi Ren. All of your work is amazing. I listen or watch one song then try another one and it seems to be better than the last one. It sure helps me get through these 5 hours of dialysis three times a week. Keep it going. This song should be number one in America soon. If not it’s because the right people aren’t listening. I knew the first day I saw you guys that I knew you were going to number one. Easily the best singer and crew that I’ve ever seen. If it’s was up to me you guys would be on top of every chart out there. I can’t say enough good things about all of you.
Found this randomly, and now I can't stop listening. Please continue making music, this is a masterpiece.
Goddamn
This is great so true about life wicked.
At first I fought this Tommy Shelby😅😅😅
Feed the algorithm, feed Ren, so he can continue to feed our souls!
absolutely obsessed with your music rn. ure amazing dude
Lol, music Is the constant of life.....  Pain is the most important ingredient of life....
You have such a gift!  Art of music you’ve mastered it!! ❤
Insanely talented! speechless! While speaking 100% truth!
Thanks Ren for speaking my mind in a masterful, moving voice.
We're all damaged.
💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Incredible ❤
As usual lost for words and words that convey the magnitude of talent I’ve just witnessed.
The Violins in this Song, are Haunting and Beautiful! I think, I just think that Artists of Today, Tomorrow and the Future could learn a thing or two about Production, Music and Lyrics from Ren as all of his Songs just hit differently
Wow! 😮
I have been a fan since "Hi Ren," but one thing that I have struggled with is what word to use to classify your music style.  I think I have finally figured it out.  The only fair term to use that describe all of your talents without misleading others when they ask what type of music is it? I respond with: "its called Ren."
Fantastic xxx
Bro, this us beautiful
ur a genius
I think all of rens music gets me thinking a very certain way
Music Video better than the first one, yet still waiting for the part 2 video.
Who's still watching this on repeat? I am.
Why does he go from being a coder nerd to a gangsta ?? Edit: obviously it’s genius blabla and really entertaining I was just surprised
😮😮😮 Masterpiece
😮😮😮 Masterpiece
Legend
Another Ren song, another banger.
Even successful people are miserable.
REN WE PLAYED TFT TOGETHER THE OTHER DAY HAHAHA. AND COMPOSE MORE ORIGINAL PIANO WORK!!
This is not just Music. This is Entertainment, a system-critizing Masterpiece making it easy to comprehend whats going on the world...
One of the best storytellers that I've seen so far
Beautiful...
I got something what never before
just WOW ren this is brilliant . Thank you for this perspective
Made me cry but from something Deep inside... Fucking awesome
songs usually have messages, this however, is a message that happen to be in the form of a song
......Thanks Youtube Algorithm.... Now how do I explain this woody to my wife?!?    What a masterpiece. Thank you.
fire again
Thank you for the love of the art.
He looks like Tommy Shelby of Peaky Blinders and somewhat similar themes
So damn weirdly wonderful
I hope Michelle show will like this
wow
درررررررعة
the most thomas shelby musician i've known so far lmao
Ren looks like a peaky blinder here :D
Art.
He raped my mind while too high idk how to feel and my hope is dead pale purple and green she lives in a toilet because I got raped and then he ducking raped my mom 😢😂
0:40
Fuck cancer I miss Jeff 💔8️⃣
💚🖤💛💔💔🕕
Boo I see you
Hey I think your lyrics and overall perspective on your song just touches my heart so personally I can barely explain except that I’m an empath and I can feel your pain but I do not necessarily feel the pain of it as much as that might suck! I know it sounds weird!
ALL THE TIME, ITS BEEN US WHO KILL US.......... ITS ME WHO ALWAYS KILLS ME............
I COULD USE THIS LESSON
INDEED IS REAL LIFE
GREAT CONCEPT
I COULD USE
I would die for a behind the scenes video.
🤎🤎🤎🤎wow
An absolute masterpiece, although the mild anti-capitalism is utopian at best
As a writer, performer, producer, and fellow dreamer (with my own demons to battle every day), I have to pause to praise this video. This piece struck deeply in a way I was not wholly prepared for. Compliments to everyone involved and especially to Ren for sharing his own dream with this wealth addicted world.
😮❤
No fricking way
Such great cinematography, done in a random warehouse. Like I think people forget this is all done on a very basic set, yet it's still such an excellent piece.
Way to go Ren!!!!  Jaw is dropped. Waiting oh so patiently to see how you top this one. You keep raising the bar for yourself  and you seem to effortlessly seem to Excell and rise above your expectations.  I watch. I see you. I hear you. And for seem reason I feel you.... you are a rare  specimen on this earth.  Dude...  I'm watching listening you are changing things . Mad love!!! Lovepeace
holy fuck this is amazing.
Pure artistic & musical genius
❤
Crazy album. Dont think you know it yet but this is going to make a huge change to the music we listen too. Well played for carrying on as you have. Deserve all the success that comes with it and stay safe and happy 💙👏👏👏
Congrats on 2m views (and counting)
this is so crazy
I'm so glad I listen to Money Game pt 2 every couple weeks or so so I wasn't too late for this lol
a true artist, commanding your attention and emotion. beautiful.
We’re all part of this whole money game 💔  Thank you, Ren, for making this
Another brilliant song!! Congrats on getting no 1 in the UK!!  You deserve it! I can’t wait for more!!
I’ve been watching many reactions to this song and reading comments. The one thing that I love about Ren is he gets everybody discussing, analysing, and thinking like no artist I have heard. What an artist, what a genius.
She sells sushi
It is truly sad how little has changed between parts 2 and 3.
Bruh, what if his dad is the guy who sold see shells from part 2?
wow
this is so fucking good.
ren put some lyrics please i know you always do this, Love you thanks for your amazing art
Genius
Ren is just a normal person using his brain and his eyes, trying to tell you how things are and make enough doing it to pay his bills guys.
Wooow,.... Wtf!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
Who on earth Is deciding on the video. Shocking as equal to the songs. Goosebumps.
🔥
That opening!!! Gorgeous piano
This is a great message
Your art is so amazing dude; the way you portray it and share it is just breathtaking
This is utterly fantastic mate. The lyrics, visual storytelling, and camera work, it’s just, so, so phenomenal! Love it mate! ❤
fucking love this
just cillian murphy  spittin bars
Aaaaaaaaaaa
Ren just doesn't miss. We need more musicians willing to write songs about the state of the world and the things people refuse to talk about.
So powerful. What an artist. No one like him. He's like the best bits of Bowie, Eminem, Dizzee Rascal and Shakespeare all blended.
This is important and captivating
The peaky blinder that went into music.
As a lot of your songs Ren, THIS IS A MASTERPIECE I really admire you and the quality of your art
*and she sold sea shells on the sea shore..*
Outstanding 👌
❤
yo oppenhaimer musical take?
Genius....pure genius
Yes
i liked the detail on YOUR mask , did you use corn starch ?
2000000
Holy wow, I love stumbling upon music like this. This gave me goose bumps, Im definately going to listen to this in our shop demo truck and cry for no reason LOL
I love how you cut the music in this one and quite literally spell out the message in this one. I love meaningful music that pushes past simple entertainment.
UNIQUE!!! Don't stop doing messages like this! This is remarkable, powerful, such good art, political, truth, reality and this is what people need to hear! You are a real activist, philanthropist poet/rapper. With all the shit going on in the World still today in 2023, words that you said here are vital for people to hear
This is history in the making
Ren your music is so creative.  Thank you ❤
modern version of pink floyd, amazing revelation
this is gold
Nice
How many parts are there 😮
Literal Genius.
Thanks Ren outstanding.
Piano sounds like matt Bellamy
Facts!
Well done young man. Absolutely.
WHO SAID I'M IN LOVE..
This is what music should be, not mindless garbage, meaningful lyrics that get you to think and have a lasting impact.
A sequel we didn't know we need
Thanks for this art!
Looks like Thomas Shelby
Just bought the album and hi ren single amazing stuff!!!
ну и пааша
Well deserved number 1 my dude
The world needs more music like this.❤
Ren: "Cut the music, this isn't entertainment, this is real life..." Entire comment section: "Wow! Great musical production, fantastic camerawork., stunning visuals!"    its like the entire message of the product became irrelevant 😭
What did I witness? I just discovered his music. I think I need a week to recover from this.
unbelievable
F*_k...
I'd like to know how many takes :D Genius piece of art. Ren without the visuals is only 3/4 Ren. Randomly quantifying. Camera and story telling is so good.
its Perfect i love it 😮
The best thing about Ren is how the comments on his videos are just as pretentious as his music.
Woah.
THAT WAS 9 MINUTES?
I remember when I discovered you in cover songs with Sam Tompkins on the street and I'm thankful for that to see you grow as an artist. It is heart-warming to see you finally getting your flowers that you deserve.
wow
Is this a hamilton reference ? becose is a masterpiece
Kim, just press it.
They say perfection is always denied,but I'm not so sure now.
Amazing performance!!! ❤
Vaya obra de arte
Damn Ren. Ur so talented!!!! ❤❤❤
'Genius' is overused, but Ren has it in a complete package. How can one pick out one element?  it's the entire concept pulled off here. Ren is a fantastic writer, composer, singer, musician, and creative force, separate elements crafted as one brilliant message.
The Last Bard
Thomas shelby goin crazy bruh 🔥🔥🔥🔥
damn part 3
Genius🤯
No. 1 Album, well done and well deserved mate.
So honest question that has my curiosity. Can you use a genuine silver spoon while uh " chasing the dragon" ? I don't know the melting point of silver or when drugs break down at and no experience with either but it popped into my head! Ha😂 I still absolutely love this song! Shout out to Rens piano play too! I love when he plays piano!
Now this is ARTTTT

[Piano and yodelling intro]  [Verse 1] Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy 1 years old and his first words were "Mine, mine, gimme!" 2 years old he was walking, 3 years old walking quickly 4 years old he was running 'round the pavements of his city 5 years old and his daddy told him "Listen here, son You gotta learn to be a man, a man, he works for what he wants" 6 years old and he’s reading, writing, top of the bunch And when he's 7, his progression made him student number 1 8 years old and he’s praised for unusual grades 9, his parents pay for private school to nurturе the flame 10, 11, 12, 13, he ascеnds and ascends His daddy tells him "Son, money is the means to all ends" 14, solving complex mathematic equations At 15, IQ 150, still elevating 16, he develops complex software code That detects weaknesses in cyber security protocols 17, and he sells his vision keeping a share Not yet an adult, but he's practically a millionaire 18, and his daddy tells him "Now you're a man This world don't give a damn about you, so take all that you can" 19, he turns a profit stocks and shares invest in product 20, double-down deposits, 21, his income rockets 22, he learns that truth is just an obstacle to wealth If you manipulate the data, then a lie will sell itself 23, a life of luxury, crystal and cocaine 24, he makes the Forbes list, they're applauding his name 25, and his daddy tells him, "Listen here, son While you are sitting in that palace, that don't mean that you won" 26, a business shift, he switches business to arms He's 27, dealing nuclear and shells in Iran 28, inside the Senate money bought him a seat He's 29, a role of the council in the president's suite Now he’s 30, his daddy says "You're losing the race You're just a servant to the king, not even in second place" 31, a big maneuver for his daddy’s approval Moving imports over borders from the exports out of Cuba 32, moving grams, growing kilos to tonnes He's 33, filling warehouses with powder and guns 34, turf war with nobody to stop it Blind eye from the po-po inside of his pocket 35, he gets a call, "I'm sorry son It's your father, had a heart attack, I'm sorry, he’s gone" 36, getting pissed up, abusing his product 37, eyes glazed, disposition demonic 38, with a prostitute, a moment of passion Heating up a silver spoon and then chasing the dragon 39, getting reckless and hungry for power Daddy’s words still driving him to kill and devour He makes a move against the cartel, but the strategy's flawed They retaliate and leave him in a hospital ward A bullet buried in his vertebra and one in his leg The doctor sighs and says "I don’t think you’ll be walking again", fuck  [Verse 2] Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy He was 40, and he cursed the words "Mine, mine, gimme" 41, he wasn’t walking, 42, not walking quickly 43, never running 'round the pavements of his city 44 inside a palace with a mountain of gold But those riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves Weighing heavy on his conscience is the value of gold Lamborghini for a life, trading money for souls Jimmy followed the code inside the land of the free Put your hand inside the cookie jar, take more than you need And his example is exaggerated versions of me And it's a version of him, and it's a version of she And it's a version of you, there’s no escaping the blame The way we live is parasitic, fuck the money and fame! Cut the music!  [Verse 3] This isn’t entertainment, this is real-life The way we live is lunacy, community, it declines We're hyperpolarized, we're always fighting, and we divide Truth is less important than the money that we design? Money's an invention, politics from our invention They all come from peoples' ideas, did I mention? Borders? An invention, law, and order fuel the tension That leads to people killing each other. My solution? Everything is subject to change We could build utopias if individuals were taught to use their brains But if we teach kids in school to always be sheep And put themselves before the herd if there's more money for me Then there’s no future I see, where the humans survive We're parasites inside a Petri dish with cannibal minds Mold will grow upon a surface, then consumes till it dies And our fate could be the same without this story for the wise [Outro] 45, Jimmy comes home out of the rain Soaking wet upon a wheelchair, drinking again He is everything he wants, he has fortune and fame He’s a fortunate fool with an unfortunate fate With a 45 caliber aimed at his brain 45 - a fitting number, 'cause his age is the same Hears the words of his father; "It's such a damn shame" Then he presses on the trigger of a money game
🔥🔥🔥
I hope i new this artist decades ago 🥺 Ilove music like this 🔥🔥🔥
Емаа, это сериал чтоли?))
You can't own anything, you're just taking care of things until either it or you dies. The same motivation which is put into money and power should be put into which ideas create the greatest benefit to the greatest amount of things.
.
Unbelievable! Fucking amazing music ❤
ART
Hi Ren, thank you for being on the same planet at the same time. To me, you are a beacon of light.
❤
I ❤ You   You are SO CREATIVE,..NEVER STOP❣️🤗
IM LAAAAATE
Amazing!
07:25 If taking off your clothes is the solution, then some of us want to be the problem.
Art.
What? Dang, , , , , Oh my gosh. WOW, wow!
Another masterpiece.
Amazing
Origin story of proffesor X
that was just amazing. i have no other words, just purely amazing.
Pure talent👌🏻
OMG
The whole team. You are amazing. Applause.
Brilliant as always Ren. Speaking the truth 🙌 ❤
This feels like sobering up after a bad trip and having my feelings come back in full
bro got that Peaky Blinders drip
no matter what style.of music you listen to a true musician wont underestimate just how good thia writing is on so many levels
Too many Jimmy's in thus world. Ren is probably one of the best artists alive now 🇬🇧
Best thing I’ve ever seen and heard. Congratulations from Spain fellah.
Cannot stop listening to this track on the album. It’s genius.
this is absolutely amazing. Ren's work continues to blow me away
Big up
Genius 👏
Love the song. Outstanding work Ren.
❤❤❤
I just love the way Ren uses silence.
"But those riches turn to rubble, and perspectives evolve"   Thank you Ren
Please never stop making music Ren :)
i have seen the ... moriarty's motivation in your eyes...
❤
Jet again a masterpiece
Well done Ren!! And congrats to Sam and the team as well!!Thank you for sharing your musical talents with the world. Numero uno!!  Ive noticed that this video and Hi Ren are equal in length. I believe them to be equal in impact as well. And soon in views as well!!
Based
Sick Ren. Original Art
epic
Once again, a masterpiece. I have yet to find any song that you created that was a pos. Every one was perfection
Almost 2 million vews in 9 days wow!
This is fire!🔥
You are suffering because you have not sought Christ.
Please, can we stop talking about how good the music is? What's to gain here is the message. That's why ren wrote it.
Is the beginning inspired by Liszt and or Chopin?
...this entire video was done with one shot
Wow!
Just got turned on to this brilliant storytelling. SERIOUSLY FK CNN they don't have a clue
holy shit
I love it 😊
You know that is a masterpiece when you are watching quiet and full of creeps
Plus des gens doivent voire ce chanson là.
Masterpiece
He's not wrong. Here comes the Ren revolution. Said this would happen 6 yrs ago.
Ren in a suit isnt fair. Mans got those actor looks mixed with all this talent. Hes cheating. God gave him the Konami code to life.
I love this man
Just fucking brilliant. From the music. The lyrics. The videography, etc. There’s a reason you’re number 1 in the UK. You’re number 1 in our eyes in the US as well. Sure hope the numbers will show it soon. Much love, sir.
LOVE the beethoven-esque intro! Love ALL the money games, but THIS is just wonderful ❤ (however, the 1st two, imo, the messages were a bit more powerful in regards  to the messages/imagery)
Beautiful Ren.. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils. Timothy 6:10
This was beautifully done, Ren! A masterpiece indeed. "Life imitates art far more than art imitates life"
I hurt physically it's my fault i work h....
just ...... just
Can't deny the multiple talents of Ren. You've got the heart of a true warrior..  Lyrics sharper than a double edged sword.
There are artists who'd sacrifice every plaudit they've received throughout their entire career to create something akin to Hi Ren OR the Tale of Jenny & Screech OR the Money Game Trilogy.  I've long said, while Hi Ren is Ren's most important work, the Tales trilogy is his magnum opus, but with part 3, the Money Game trilogy POSSIBLY takes the mantel.  At the very LEAST, it's akin to Beethoven releasing his 5th AFTER the 9th.
If Thomas Shelby was to sing 😂😂😂 I can't unsee it .
WOW!
🔥
Pure poetry
Didnt know the Shelby family made great music too!!
Fuck me !
I look up money game to find the second one and find the third one instead.
spend some of that cash on your  teeth homie
Congratulations ren I’ve been listening to your music from the start amazing artist well done mate 🎉🎈
This is the best you've done. I'm recording my first single in 9 hours and I have this on repeat.
"The truth is just an obstacle to wealth, if you manipulate the data then the lie will sell itself" 🔥
The complete lack of trigger safety...
Blockbuster 🎉
This fucking hits
Dudes a master of his craft
Please make a song about a boy called charlie
YES MAN somehow you keep improveing in that you diliver
Wow, what a powerfully worded piece of artistic perfection. You are right Ren, this is the real world. Greed breeds distruction! I'll be definitely sharing this one too as I've done with all your amazing songs 💖
Thank you. I am following you from 300 till the end.
this is incredible, really
Wow.
stay clean  👃, u gonna be a legend kido respect
Pure welsh talent boy 😍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
Ehm... what... did I see there? ... Its... so... I'm not sure. Its awesome work! Never seen something like this before. Wow, you are amazing!
This is pure art.
I am so glad you are getting the recognition you deserve,this is amazing. For anyone new here, check out Ren's band The Big Push busking in Brighton, you won't be dissappointed.
Phenomenal as usual
The globe stopping its spinning as he picks up the call about his father is such an amazing underrated visual in this. I keep catching more and more each time I watch, everything is so perfectly choreographed
just wow, i got involved in the story lol.
damn, fire.
The money game trilogy is literally a masterpiece.
Masterful
One of the greatest pieces I’ve seen him do
Brilliant ❤🫶
3 incredible bangers full of genius
DAMN!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Damn Ren sounds like you are describing our disdain with Hunter, THE SON OF THE MOST POWERFUL LEADER ON THIS PLANET BUT IF YOU LOOKED AT HIM HE WOULD THINK THAT IS YOUR MOST POWERFUL LEADER!?!  YEAH MAN 81 MILLION DUMBASSES AND THEY THINK THEY'RE FOOLING EVERYONE..  TO THE FOOLS MAY THEY ALL BURN IN HELL!  I DARE YOU OPEN YOUR NEWSPAPER TURN ON THE TELEVISION AND YOU WILL SEE WHERE THIS HAS GOTTEN US
Absolutely brilliant.
This song needs to be done as a Netflix series! I can see Ren playing  the lead like a young modern Tommy Shelby. Cillian Murphy can play older Jimmy 😅
orz
It's funny how many people in Ren video comments indicate their age. Not to be a non conformist , I am 58 and I dig this music. I just discovered Ren and I'm besides myself.  I just lost a dear friend last week to cancer and this music has pulled me out of my misery and sadness. Life is truly wonderful and discovering such talent in music and art gives me hope and joy to be alive.  I just wish I had time to share Rens music with my friend.
comment for the algorithm love your work ren
saw Ren performing with big push in brighton circa 2019., talent was instantly recognizable. amazing
I think we all that doesn´t know who he is just skipped like 15 sec through the whole video with 17 clicks
Jaime ceci beaucoup
What a masterpiece, congrats to you and you video making team, such a great video
Needing this as a netflix short movie
Yo, that's impressive. Not only track alone, but his acting and visuals in this video are insane. Everything well-planed to the tiny bit
REN IM PROUD OF YOU........................................... Hey Knox...fuck algorithms, i hate them. Bless you though x
Holy fuck
Ren looks like Thomas Shelby in young
This is just...words are not enough to express what I'm feeling, it's so beautiful and sorrowful. Keep up your work, it's truly amazing!!
Wait people actually like this?
absolutely legendary. this is the definition of art
Wait this is new?!!!
actual goosebumps
This is not music. Its ART.
❤

Bloody brilliant 🤩
We are watching In real time the birth of a star. I think his story telling is as good as Johnny cash and his guitar skills wow oh wow! Jimmy Hendrix ❤
damn
No matter how many times I watch this….. Goosebumps!!!
Scratch any criticism I have ever made ever. Masterpiece!!
Yo, Thomas Shelby going CRAZYYY
I can't stop listening to this, it's breathtaking. You're making a real change in the way music is made and portrayed. A real inspiration.
Fire
I like it.I
I think this has to be the best music video I've ever seen.
Just too good
this one sent shivers down my spine... rap, slam poetry, theater Ren uses all this as tools in his swiss knife
Wait is that Tommy Shelby???
Look at me hector
Masterpiece
Это Шастун за роялем?
Congratulations #1🎉🎉
black pu
I LOVE YOU REN.
What an important man you are right now! Well done for seeing through the game. May you be hugely successful and wake more people up to this nonsense that we're now living. Peace to you and everyone on this planet 🙏
🙄zzzzzzzzzzzzzz people been rapping about this shit for decades but a middle class white boy does it and it's all 😍
Keep those feet on the ground and make the world fly. Such talent.
Impressed
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 wow!
Comment for the algorithm god  . Good shit mate , and true shit .
Damn you look good in a suit!! And a Peaky Blinders haircut lol, rawwr. Freaking love this song trilogy, its right up there with Stevie Wright's "Evie"- just brilliant, each song/section is better than the one that came before it, and altogether the  sum becomes greater than its parts, creating something so beautiful, educational, emotional and evocative and powerful...it's art. Ohmygod- WHY DON'T MORE PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT REN??!!!💖💖💖👍👍
Новая звезда Бриттани ✌🏻👍🏻
I think, among his many talents, his greatest is that he can rap on any beat. This is a frickin piano.
wait . . . jimmy . . . ? wheelchair . . . ?  its a... HARDCORE HENRY REFERENCE!!
Just amazing
This is sublime... like a medieval troubadour singing the songs and stories of humanity for the conciousness to grow. big love <3
Hi Ren, I really think you would find this new, creative ‘map’ video of how the money game (waterworks they call them here) benefits the rich and not all of us/society and what could be done to change this!!  https://youtu.be/Ycit4WbJuwE?si=BUvDIYyuMBWYI53A
GENIUS as ever.
Another master piece, what can I say…? Outstanding, eyeopening… hitting… especially as I know exactly how expectations of the father take effect on the rest of your life and how hard it could be sometimes to cut that circle… 🤯  But here is something different…  I don‘t know if you know the series „the fall of the house of Usher“? It looks like the listen to your tracks Sick Boi and Money Game and made a film out of it… 😳😉  Your a fantastic Artist as you seem to be a wonderful human beeing.  Keep on moving on that path and thanks a lot for all the triggers you sent to my heart and my brain wich pushes me forward to myself… P.
Holy.  Thank you. The video is amazing the words are powerful. Thank you. I wish you health and happiness.

I stumbled across Ren a couple of months ago and I was absolutely blown away.  I’m 48 and his raw talent resonates with me like no person before. Congratulations Ren on being you, never change!
an Artist.
This is art
No.1 baby 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Just brilliant…Ren is a genius
Wow, just wow 🥺
I like Pagan Min's new style :0
Can we appreciate the filming of this video tho? Looks absolutely fantastic!
Nice bit of Grieg! Congrats :) I would love to see an interview with  Zane Lowe!
MASTERPIECE SPOTTED
🖤

here before this blow up🔥🔥🔥
Very reminiscent of 50 cents meny men video....seems to draw on a lot of points....well in my opinion well the wheel chair bit
you are my favourite artist. keep up the good work
Keep it up Ren! I love your music and the way you tell these stories so well
Speechless
This is amazing and all and I fully agree. I hope that even though this song is made amazingly, the focus won't be about how it was made and how beautiful it is but why it was made and the meaning of it.
Beaultiful
This is the pinnacle of Ren and Sam.... simply the best thing they have created.......... YET
Wow. I’m 63 and always referred to rap as (c)rap music: until now!
This IS a MASTERPIECE! The lyrics gives me so much emotions, I'm crying and shaking.  He has the answer fot all what's wrong in the world. God if we could wake up and listen! I'm knocked to the ground but also thankful....and lost for words right now. Thank you REN for being in this world. ❤❤❤❤
Спасибо. Именно так.
You're No 1 Ren..... Music, profound lyrics delivered with artistry captured with some great camerawork, Wow!!.... You've come a long way from me watching you busk on the streets of Brighton with Big Push Ren... Well done from a 68 year old follower of your art...
Just. Wow.
🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
What a MASTERPIECE, ALGORITHM
Powerful, as always.
I came here with a bucket for goosebumbs. I gotta be back with a shipping container😮
This is a masterpiece. I lost it at the string quartet section, such hauntingly beautiful lyrics and strings. Such a powerful message in masterful story telling and visual accompaniment.
vhjv
Music for people with a attention span longer than 1 minute 😊
algo
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
👍👍👍👍👍👍
Bros woke af
Wth did i just watch
I'll have to watch this over and over to assimilate each verse.  Well done
There’s a before and an after you discover Ren.
My dude, I didn’t want it to end, and when it ended I was like, 9 minutes?!? No way -there must be a mistake, these were 2 minutes tops-. Genius. I was so into it I didn’t realise time was passing🥹 🫶🏼 So happy for you and thank you again. I’m still waiting for that concert 💜🫶🏼
Yes you found it
Great Job! ❤
Could not just walk by this masterpiece.   This, my people, is an Art. Period.
There's something about 'it's a version of him and it''s a version of she' that kills me. We're all guilty of this shit. All of us.I'm old enough to remember walking down a busy high st before we were all fucked by Amazon, So happy for where you'e got, never forget mate. Never forget. Stay with that narative.
Love all of your's story- telling. The lyrics are magnificent, as usual
Leaving a comment to for the Algorithm so more people can see this video cuz everyone needs to listen to this song!         Please don’t raise you kids like this!
Speachless.
you need to be on top.. amazing.. again...
Deeply moving damming and inspiring.  Awesome.  Ren and team.  Keep it coming.  Be safe and Be well.
OMG this is
Nice
Am i the only one that listen this more than 10 time /day ?
this was quite the spectacle, a vast thoughtful performance
BANGER
this is amazing, at first i thought this was going to be another piano boy trying to make it big but this is art. only 2 takes as well. This is better then NF.
Congrats on #1.  Well deserved. Whoever was handling the camera on this video was masterful.  Simply amazing artistry!
piece de resistance!!!
Ren is number 1 in the UK album charts. 😊 brilliant news
Listen, I know life is all a money game, but please don't be so greedy as to put midroll ads on this masterpiece. I suppose it adds to the message though lol
Don't know if anyone noticed, but the trigger pulling at the end was a blank, implying there will be a money game part 4
I adore the attention to detail: at first, you can see his suit tidy and his tie tightened, but at the end of the video you can see his shirt all messed up and his tie loose
Young man, you are changing the world, turning the music industry on its head. I’m sure corporate music heads are exploding trying to figure out how they can make money off of this. Amazing. Congratulations.
This speaks...
Having to come back for seconds and thirds and more to fully digest this message. Ren, you are a breath of fresh air. As a Christian living in America and an Army veteran, I have questioned the very institutions who demonstrate the hypocrisy of being a nation of God while stealing land and making profit. I am glad the independent artists like you, Knox, Tom MacDonald and others are stepping up and speaking what we have been wanting to say for a long time.
Gordon Ramsey?
Money      When it’s not a game anymore…
masterpeice
Just wanna say a massive congratulations on getting the number 1 on the charts. Soo happy to see you get to this point after watching you for about 5 years can't wait too see what you coming in the future glad to be apart of the journey keep up the good work bro bless
Greatest experience in music ive ever had, bravo young man, bravo 😢
Intro piano  If it’s original composition . That is insanely wicked . By that I mean it’s beautiful piece of music
Good song but I personally just hate a song with counting in it 😂
Oh piss on it. Where are your comments with the lyrics Ren? When someone gets too big I can no longer relate to them. They forget who they are and their music usually suffers because of it. Then it's time for me to continue on. Thanks for the years of music Ren. Enjoy stardom.
Usually don’t put comments, but this song is so good that it deserves it
Ren is a man with a story to tell or is it two men with a story or two to tell? Either way, his phrases run deep, so I hope you can feel the the words of rhythm  the same as I...
The way he says Lamborghini with such spite and age is fascinating.
👏 👏 👏 👏
It's fuking tomes Shelby
I loved it!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
End of the Road.
Love ya Ren   work at 711 in California tell all about u!!!
Strange how intuitively we understand  the message, but tonight we will sleep and tomorrow we will forget we are all part of the problem and the solution.
REN is a MASTERPIECE! ❤
MASTERPIECE
I am in awe of these wonderful stories and amazed at how they make the reality of the world be known through these wondrous story telling.
THIS IS A REVOLUTION
FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow wow wow!
this is crazy good I can't wait to see his other work ☮❤
WE KNOW THIS IS A PROBLEM WHY CANT WE DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT?!?!
Can a music video be eligible for an Oscar for best short film? Because this deserves it.
Lmao what is the crap? 😂
🎉
dude, you would play freaking awsome joker
This man is a savant
This is insane! Great job, keep it up!
Was that REN playing that piano? That's crazy good.
Far from a masterpiece but maybe a master turd
Just bought your album. Keep it going. Best art I’ve seen in years.
👍wasnt expecting it to be that good.
Your music is art. Your Words are important. Your storytelling is exelent. One of the bravest voices out there with the topics you pick for your songs. I truly love your work.
to me, your art is like reading, thinking, moving and watching all at once. music, poetry, philosophy and holding up the mirror for humanity to have a chance at seeing...
Money is fine for valueing things but it is a destructive way to value ourselves or others. It isn't that the world don"t care about ya, because there is a vast pool of good humans, in the middle we sleep, we don't worship the bleat,  but we don't make enough noise, so we feel as if the extremes are pulling us apart when we should be pulling back. Find those who do care, it isn't hard because actually   it us the majority, and dwell there.
Took my breath away...
Masterpiece.
Amazing.   Thank you  ❤
Dude that was incredible 😎
'Walking off a cliff.' 🤠💜💚
Money game part 1 2 and this one 3 are all up with hi ren on my favorites
Wow
WOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW

Elegant, thank you. Peace my brother.
🤑💰🤑
Did you pick the rubix cube up at 15 because thats how many moves it takes you to solve it? ... BRRAAAP!
Nothing in recent years has embodied "Music as Art" as much as these lyrics and video.
Wow!
Day 8? - ahh who cares what day it is Ren's #1 🎉🎉🎉
Thomas Shelby never fails to deliver... No memories... Only lessons...
all i can say is ren what the fuck fucking all some
Found it 😂 you usually pin the comment
@RenMakesMusic you didn't leave the lyrics ❤ i just love your music and videos i relate to your music
Some of the most amazing poetry I've ever heard
This man had me transfixed. He’s a brilliant artist.❤
The first 14 years of Jimmy's life sound very much like everything that's happened to me in my 14 years of life and now I'm extremely fucking scared please help
I didn't know the peaky blinders made music!  Dope!
This is a beautiful piece of art 🖤
Bravo
Powerful
Hunter Biden

Insane!
This is real, raw & so truthful! What does greed, excessive materialism brings you in the end. This is masterful on the level of storytelling, lyrics, meaning & film making. Are we an audience & the world witnessing a reBirth or the next Prince of modern music. Good, Great, Brilliant & Awe inspiring! Damn, world listen up! We have something special here! Thanks Ren.
this was really fucking good
"Riches turn to rubble when perspective is involved". What a quote, what a monologue, what a raw talent and what a video 👏
"Riches turn to rubble when perspective is involved". What a quote, what a monologue and what a video 👏
Awesome Sauce Maestro!
Ren your a genius! Art Masterpiece done 🤝🤝🤝👑 take your crown
Congrats on #1 brother, you deserve it.
Okay, wasn't expecting anything of what I saw and heard. Superb.
This is simply Phenomenal.
The 5 year old was reading "Business economics" :|
Holy sh*t this is the most amazing thing I've heard in years. It's stunning
well that was that. i think we all resonated with it in some way
no homo but rens a good looking lad, plus the brains, skill, talent, skills
Ein ganzer Film in einem Lied!
WOW! What a great song, what a important message! And damn, what a f*** good Video! Thank u for doing that!
Wann kommt das one piece
🌆
MASTERPIECE!!! From music to Video perfection!
Fucking awsome  💚✌️🌈
Legend has it he actually kidnapped a guy for this
I love the music you make because it forces the listener to reflect.  I'm not even sure how to put it into words on a youtube comment.
Trigger of a money 💰 game
❤
Uh, Hamilton??
Genius , you made it Ren 🎉
Ren could be a new Bowie for a new generation an artist on every level, and he surrounds himself with equally talented people, the cinematography, the set design, just the timing is epic it all comes together to make the world stop for a minute and make you listen and think. Here's to more Ren all power to your elbow mate.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Congrats on hitting #1!
Never heard of this guy before, but this is amazing. The text, to the music and the video style no other words for it then pure art.
Morgenshtern is the best
So we’ll done, in fact genius…..
Your talent is beyond dope bruh...🎉
The absolutely raw talent this beautiful human has is mind blowing..never in the history of music has there been a person who has this level talent..Now this is so unique, who can song write like this 🤯🤯.can you imagine watching a theatre play of one of he's songs,.The feeling's, the emotion, the words ,the intelligence,the theatrical play...unbelievable mind blowing 🤯🤯🤯🤯❤
Amazing
was gonna type something, but actualy have no words.......
MASTERPIECE!!!! ❤❤❤
Once again, I am blown away.
Man... Really proud of having been here when this released, and now it ll likely get to a hundred K. And even more abt an hour ago he got the number 1 position... Really awesome
I cuss, I yell, I scream: at those around me, when they speak of greed as natural, as others as not their problem. Its beyond frustrating its ENRAGING!! Yet when I watch and listen 2 Ren speak on such ideas all I can do is be amazed at the way he conveys how I feel about this current system that we are in, and at the end, I tear up thinking: Maybe just maybe, He can actually reach those with a poisoned mind and hopefully influence change that's better for the whole and weakens the selfish powerful ones..?? So I'll do all I can to share his music with as many as possible and just hope that is in our future, otherwise like he said we an organism are done on this planet!
<3
The song is amazing and the camera work phenomenal
MASTERPIECE love the sound of   the bottle hitting the floor when it was quiet that really is a silent killer
Talent is un fucking matched
If you ever feel that the inspiration is down, here is a number i hope you hav't heart..( death south---that bastard son) that exist still, just in war in  a nother way, sorry bad at english, im danish
Damn got chills from this one.
Like always impressed ❤

I wanted to take a moment to express my deep appreciation for your incredible talent and the profound impact your work has had on me. As someone with a rich history of experiencing various artists and music styles, often referred to as "boomer music," I can confidently say that your artistry is the most interesting, exciting, and versatile I have come across in decades.  I have immersed myself in your videos, reactions, and interviews, and I am truly in awe. Your ability to inspire, give hope, and make us reflect on what truly matters is unparalleled. Finally, we have an artist who embodies empathy, positivity, and the power to unite people from all walks of life. You have become a beacon of light in a world that sometimes feels uncertain.  Your music has become a source of comfort, a reminder of the beauty and resilience of the human spirit. It speaks to the core of our shared humanity and encourages us to embrace what is important in life. Your ability to connect with your audience on such a deep level is truly remarkable.  I believe in the power of humanity, and you, dear Ren, personify this belief. Through your work, you have become an inspiration for countless individuals, myself included. You have become a role model, someone we look up to and admire for your unwavering dedication to spreading positivity and fostering understanding.  I want to express my heartfelt gratitude for being the artist that defines this generation. Thank you for using your platform to uplift, encourage, and remind us of the goodness that exists within each and every one of us. Your art has touched my soul and has reminded me of the profound impact music can have on our lives.

Ren is such a genius, takes your breath away...
Congrats on the number 1 Bro. You deserve it!!!! Wanna see plenty more of them!!!
D3ADLY
youtube still broke cant like this more than once
#RenMakesMusic … Understand that all of Ren’s music videos are not just well written music and good video production… but a visual representation of his thoughts. I’m 33 and have been producing music like this since age 14 but still afraid to show my life’s work of music and storytelling because I have hella trust issues with the world the way it is. I don’t know if I could take the judgement like he can. Props to him.
Possibly the greatest, and certainly one of the greatest pieces of audio visual art through the genre of music video ever produced.  The End Game.
looks like this world isn't done giving us real artists who aren't afraid afraid to speak about the truth in this world.
Scheiß die wand an!
Done and executed to precision💥💪👏🔥🙌🇰🇪
Happy to enjoy your magnificent creations. Keep your inner knowing growing to help others emerge from the darkness and create the light we all seek which resides within ourselves waiting to be released.
Number 1 🎶🎶🎶🎶😁😁😁😁😁
should've left this in the drafts
Ren you are a very special human. Exceptional, remarkable talent. Mind those mast cells the world needs you! ☺️
This artist is a genius, absolutely a Masterpiece.
🔥
I was here within the first week!!
Such a artist.. like Danny elffman
This genius..fire
And yes sir a true inspiration
If you ever get a second,  I'd love to hear how you made this work during the pain, and continue to inspire us all
Ren I thought I was in it alone .  All the pain etc.  Thank you.  100 times thank you
Come on Ren first of many  number one albums🎉🎉
Not bad.
I would never have thought of Thomas Shelby as a singer
Absolutely insane
Fav song. Commenting for the algorithm
The beginning of this gives me real 007 Theme song vibes 🔫 Ren you could really Kill it Softly mate!
Can't wait for Luigi to explain this
And here we are with another great song
I think the gun get jammed..so  At 46, like a phoenix from the ash Jimmy's rebirth, a brilliant flash His life's tapestry, a vibrant splash In the sunshine, he starts to dash New horizons, in a world so vast At 46, his journey's mast....  🤣🤣🤣
Amazing track and video!!. Why weren’t the black circle eyes drawn on the masks?
This man
Absolute gold
Congrats on the No 1 Album in the UK charts!!! 💚💚💚💚

The level of cinematography is unreal. A real masterpiece 🔥
love you ren
Been watching his music vids since yesterday when I first heard violet's tale. I always love a song that has a deep story.. I even made my friends listen to it even though I know they don't want this kind of music because it's so good. It needs to be heard by many
🦴🦮
This. Puts. Me. In. Awe.
KEEP YOUR BOOGER HOOK OFF OF THAT TRIGGER UNTILL YOU ARE READY TO FIRE!
best tutorial of how human greed and overachieving works
You are a beautiful ceremony of life. I dance to your truth. Fantastic Ren 🎉❤
The freedom to express yourself through your art and vision is legendary. This piece has me feeling weird yet alive. Amazing work!
This man is a musical genius, and it kills me that more people don't know about him state-side! Sending love from Nashville! Keep up the great work!
3 parts in and I'm less sure of Ren's actual political views than part 1.
Begin again - Vera Keyes
Gerat.Super.Hit in the center of a nail - you now the feelings of money and kapitalist  betrayl. Namaste a  bigger harmony is begon. to show our  fellow humans how to transform. Love from Copenhagen 🙂
Every time I hear a new drop always blown away brotha, talent is an understatement.
Es ist schön zu erleben wie ihr jungen Leute euren Traum lebt.  Ich bin stolz auf euch wie eine Mutter auf ihre Kinder. ❤

WOW! Just WOW! There is hope for artistry after all. Everyone involved in this, deserves praise
holy shit part 3
Absolute masterpiece
🔥
So true
More genius from Ren both song and video. They will be talking about Ren for generations to come.
Most profound piece of musical artistry ever produced in my opinion .
Masterpiece. Theres no better way to say this. This is a masterpiece. It's the lyrics, the incredibly powerful videoclip, the setting, EVERYTHING.
Yyyyooooooo 😮
Ren smashing it as usual, I see
Dan Oates was an amazing highlight for me in this song, glad to have found him but bummed out that he doesn't have much work for me to listen to. His small segment really got me. A fantastic Ren song as usual.
Its a masterpiece of music and films. Love it
6.24 the violins play the money  game 1 hook melody the mmmm mm bit...Nice touch and nicely hidden
Luigi been real quiet since this dropped.
Holy fuck
Geeez
Jesus Christ, Ren...pardon me, but I've probably watched this a solid 30 times and I'm still fucking amazed. Excellent work from you and Samuel once again. ✌️☝️❤️ from Missouri, my friend. My mom is a big fan, btw 😆.
Pure Art Love it !!!
This man just second hand fulfilled my dream😌. Expressed philosophy and literature that depicts the truth of life through art and articulation to engrave it in the minds of the people. Fantastic my man, I am grateful for what you just did for the world. 💛
This is literally the story of Thommy Shelby
You successfully acquired the nickname"The storyteller".
How deep is this song. This is art
Damn, artists are actually making art again
Conceptually BRILLIANT The atmosphere, tone, melody, rythm, vocals and message...  Lyrically.... Sadly lacking effort... There were many better terms and rhymes that could have been used to keep the captivation...  Just my unbiased opinion.. It could have been a tiny bit more impactful with that said..  Loved it tho!!! Well done mate!
This is absolutely incredible.
Always nice to see you, Ren ❤
Love you, thank you for your talent.
Mate.... this was fucking epic.
Pure art. Amazing work Ren, chilling work!
You are a gift, Ren.
Can we please get a 4 minute string version of the main theme. I always get goosebumps at 6:25.
was that a match-cut or can he actually play the piano that well too?
I see people watching the video i dont see people smashing that like button though!!!
This lad is off to Hollywood. Prime Talent!
Sick
I get chills every time I listen to this!
Oh gosssshh i have no words.....you allways make move all the feelings ..... Its therapy for our Souls and hearts .  This is such an ART . Can't stop listening you.  Thanks for this gifts
i would have thought someone as politically mindful as this wouldn't use the word "prostitute" nor exclude the pronoun of "they"  (yes im gonna be that gal)
you missed to include you are in the mind  and the loop +rythmics thematic was perfect  fuck you buddy you are near of the perfect again ;p i joke i love this fucking charism mixed with  emotional thinkdrops
Piano tutorial channels must be feeling the pressure right now.
Them dam theater kids are at it again
Stfu up uk...fight for ur culture
leaven a comment for the algorithm aswell
Absolutely brilliant. Everything.
Stupid cringe, keep it up
Loved it!
This is unreal
I love that the rich now has a bag and rope around his neck in part 3.   We are all now living with the turmoil they have created. And there is no quality of life when chasing huge amounts of money and a fucked reality.
REN’s songs are always quite interesting.     What I find amazing is he’s composing songs based on personal experiences.  Very emotional to say the least.  And kudos for expressing his feelings into music form.  The videos coincide with the lyrics/song to protect the message.  Brilliant!
make a luigi comeback
LTRICS     [Piano and yodeling intro]  [Verse 1] Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy 1 years old and his first words were "Mine, mine, gimme!" 2 years old he was walking, 3 years old walking quickly 4 years old he was running 'round the pavements of his city 5 years old and his daddy told him "Listen here, son You gotta learn to be a man, a man, he works for what he wants" 6 years old and he’s reading, writing, top of the bunch And when he's 7, his progression made him student number 1 8 years old and he’s praised for unusual grades 9, his parents pay for private school to nurturе the flame 10, 11, 12, 13, he ascеnds and ascends His daddy tells him "Son, money is the means to all ends" 14, solving complex mathematic equations At 15, IQ 150, still elevating 16, he develops complex software code That detects weaknesses in cyber security protocols 17, and he sells his vision keeping a share Not yet an adult, but he's practically a millionaire 18, and his daddy tells him "Now you're a man This world don't give a damn about you, so take all that you can" 19, he turns a profit stocks and shares invest in product 20, double-down deposits, 21, his income rockets 22, he learns that truth is just an obstacle to wealth If you manipulate the data, then a lie will sell itself 23, a life of luxury, crystal and cocaine 24, he makes the Forbes list, they're applauding his name 25, and his daddy tells him, "Listen here, son While you are sitting in that palace, that don't mean that you won" 26, a business shift, he switches business to arms He's 27, dealing nuclear and shells in Iran 28, inside the Senate money bought him a seat He's 29, a role of the council in the president's suite Now he’s 30, his daddy says "You're losing the race You're just a servant to the king, not even in second place" 31, a big maneuver for his daddy’s approval Moving imports over borders from the exports out of Cuba 32, moving grams, growing kilos to tons He's 33, filling warehouses with powder and guns 34, turf war with nobody to stop it Blind eye from the po-po inside of his pocket 35, he gets a call, "I'm sorry son It's your father, had a heart attack, I'm sorry, he’s gone" 36, getting pissed up, abusing his product 37, eyes glazed, disposition demonic 38, with a prostitute, a moment of passion Heating up a silver spoon and then chasing the dragon 39, getting reckless and hungry for power Daddy’s words still driving him to kill and devour He makes a move against the cartel, but the strategy's flawed They retaliate and leave him in a hospital ward A bullet buried in his vertebra and one in his leg The doctor sighs and says "I don’t think you’ll be walking again", fuck  [Verse 2] Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy He was 40, and he cursed the words "Mine, mine, gimme" 41, he wasn’t walking, 42, not walking quickly 43, never running 'round the pavements of his city 44 inside a palace with a mountain of gold But those riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves Weighing heavy on his conscience is the value of gold Lamborghini for a life, trading money for souls Jimmy followed the code inside the land of the free Put your hand inside the cookie jar, take more than you need And his example is exaggerated versions of me And it's a version of him, and it's a version of she And it's a version of you, there’s no escaping the blame The way we live is parasitic, fuck the money and fame! Cut the music!  [Verse 3] This isn’t entertainment, this is real-life The way we live is lunacy, community, it declines We're hyperpolarized, we're always fighting, and we divide Truth is less important than the money that we design? Money's an invention, politics from our invention They all come from peoples' ideas, did I mention? Borders? An invention, law, and order fuel the tension That leads to people killing each other. My solution? Everything is subject to change We could build utopias if individuals were taught to use their brains But if we teach kids in school to always be sheep And put themselves before the herd if there's more money for me Then there’s no future I see, where the humans survive We're parasites inside a Petri dish with cannibal minds Mold will grow upon a surface, then consumes till it dies And our fate could be the same without this story for the wise   [Outro] 45, Jimmy comes home out of the rain Soaking wet upon a wheelchair, drinking again He is everything he wants, he has fortune and fame He’s a fortunate fool with an unfortunate fate With a 45 caliber aimed at his brain 45 - a fitting number, 'cause his age is the same Hears the words of his father; "It's such a damn shame" Then he presses on the trigger of a money game  Thanks for creating another piece of Thunder clapping ART  Hope everyone has a great rest of your Day/Evening/Night/Dawn <3
44 inside a palace with a mountain of gold, but those riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves…goddamn
Jesus.... Stunning just fucking gorgeous please PLEASE Ren keep giving us a voice for those who cannot express themselves like yourself who suffer daily.
The cinematography in these videos along with the music amazes me every time I see a new one. Good stuff.
You will oversell the Beatles! Keep going Ren. Autoimmune disease sucks.
A FUCKING MASTERPIECE !
So when Ren says that 45s are fitting number because his age is the same. He does mean the same age as his father when his father died, right? That being said, if that's true since the character was 35 at that time, that would make his father 10 when he was born  I could just be looking into this too much or just blatantly wrong
Mammon is it true name and was a trap from the beginning, a way to bind your souls to underworlds, money exists not in realms of God but the concept of buying selling trading does in realms of Devil. Many sell their souls not realizing they do, but find out in afterlife that they worked so hard to gain a ticket into hell when they depart. This is the truth and the way to defeat it is not set heart on the money game.
This guy is MAJOR, big time talented, and a very sharp, mind - which is very sad to say the majority of "youngsters" (I'm 60, do not mean to offend), these days do not have. The depth of his work is just unbelievable
Fucking hell Ren smashed it again well played x
Ren your music is transcendental. I mostly listen to metal but I cannot deny your musicianship and your lyrical prowess. This is an awesome anarchist song, teaching people about the downside of capitalism. I really like it man. Edit: Such awesome melodies man. Such deep classical influence, but you take inspiration from all genres of music. You really are multitalented. A polymath instrumentalist. I'm not trying to blow smoke up your ass neither. Really good music with a damned good message from the heart. It's got so much heart. Its so genuine and you're not about being rich or any of that nonsense. It's about the message. I fucking love it. Edit number 2: Your lyrical deepness reminds me of Pink Floyd, but if they combined it with rapping. Songs like this are timeless man. Beyond genre classification. This is just MUSIC.
Pure cringe.
From Chris’s reaction, had to visit the original video and of course subscribe because wow
You're on another level dude. That was absolutely incredible. Please keep it coming
Ren, i want to say thank you.. from the bottom of my heart and soul.. thank you! The message you deliver is of utmost importance and urgency, and yet, nobody seems to speak on this all that often. especially not when they have any amount of influence or fame. Seems most often those who are speaking this truth do not have the ability to really reach the masses. Thank you for standing up and sticking your neck out to aid in the awakening of others. I know it can't be easy.❤❤
Seen part two before I even knew who ten was this was just as good!
Shout out to the shepherd tone at 4:22
I am an idiot.  I had his new LP in my “basket”…the “special edition” LP this morning.  I told myself I’d wait until after work.  Just looked…sold out. I am stoked for Ren…but bummed I made that decision.  I guess I shall stick to streaming on Spotify.   Word to all of the up and coming artists…when you release a “special edition” album…specify the number created.  I couldn’t find it…so figured I had time.  CRAP!! Sounds like it will be a great record.  I guess I shall buy it on cassette.  Dang, darn, crap, crud!!!
Enjoying the Music from Ren so much.
There's a REALLY small detail that really easy to miss. When he's talking about the power of a perspective change 6:00 they had the camera man perform a Hitchcock zoom where they physically move the camera closer while zooming out with the lens to create an uneasy effect. Absolutely BRILLIANT music video!!!
<3
this is magnificent. a theater performance and pure poetry rolled in to one!
Boost
No words....
Das Kapital Vol. III
thank you.
This is 🔥
Ren completely mesmerises me.. just speechless..hugely talented and articulate and expressive x
As someone who is high as fug, this is more than music. This is the meaning of life!
This shits crazy
This is such a f#$king brilliant indictment on the US society.
I cant believe i made it to the comments of the REN. Dont let stimpy out.
ADORED IT! The piano, the set, it was all brilliant. Brilliant mind, brilliant man, brilliant theatrics. It was absolutely astonishing. On a side note, please don't ever put a gun to your head. You are loved.
You ended on 45.... just saying
A.M.A.Z.I.N.G.
Banger
Thomas Shelby if he were born in the 00's.
I didn't and wont feel sympathy. Eat or don't!
Now we sell afts. Yall invest in war and act hurt when war knocks your door.
The beauty of this type of artistry is the suspense tied in with emotion of the story teller. Every time I listen to Ren's work it blows me away. Keep doing what you do!
Bravo Ren & Co.  Good luck with the charts, The internet is saying you’re in front of Rick Astley at the moment.
Dudes a creative genius. He’s already figured out the game, so he works hard to inform the rest of the world.
Incredible ❤❤❤
I really want to see a Lady GaGa and Ren duet! Does one exist yet?!?  Best awards show performance, if only it could happen! 😢
HOLY SHIT!!!! IT HAPPENED!! THANK YOU REN! YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH WE ALL NEEDED PART 3! <3
This is fucking insane
Let's figure out how to change it.
🙏😌 ✨🤯✨ 🤠👌
that's one for the guys on the right path 😌
Incredible, thought provoking song/ video/ movie/ production!
It's not something I'd loop, but damn if I'm not glad to have watched this. It's theatrical/lyrical poetry. Beautifully done.
Has Eminem this. I need to see a reaction video. Hahaha
Is this about Hunter Biden?
Holy shit....speechless...
Absolutely brilliant! Didn't see it coming.
Is this Tommy Shelby from Peaky Blinders? Damn so fire
damn  this cool
Thanks ren. Your the best ever
He doesn't miss!! This is incredible!
Ren deserves that number 1 spot. Good shit man!!!!
Wow just wow! Masterpiece
broooo true artttttttt
Wow! It's all I can say after this masterpiece
WOW. JUST WOW 🔥💯
I even hear a little bit of Michael Jackson's "Earth Song" in there.
This is friggin' amazing, mon.  Kudos, Bro.
My solution is another.
Captivating stuff Ren, I've had the album on repeat since it arrived, will be brilliant if you get the number one spot, but even if you don't it's still an amazing achievement after all you are going through with treatment and your illness.❤
I can't find the words to thank you Ren. Truly, you are an unrivaled artist, you are among the best.
Amazing Song mate , thank you
The connections REN makes between the chapters of his series leave me breathless - genius!  ❤
Woah 😮
❤ from someone who works in schools and knows what is wrong thank you.. we need reality for the next generation
This is like Danny Elfman meets Mika meets Adam Ant.
I am disabled and absolutely love this video.   paparazzi was another brave video.
Brilliance.
to rough
Its not really just a song, its a saga❤
PLAY THIS ON THE RADIO NOW!
Wow. Brilliant.
So well done!
this is a masterpiece
This is poetry....poetry and a statement!!! I applaud you man, the standing ovation!!
We're unlucky we didn't get a music video to part 2, because we already have Ren killing himself twice now.
You are just something else, very deep, thank you
Never heard of Ren until today, dont worry I watched the first couple videos before this one :)
Mamma mia 😱😱😱 credo che questo ragazzo sia troppo intelligente per questo mondo.
Absolute masterpiece 👏
Riddle me this, Batman
Leaving a comment for that #1 spot
This is something.
I don’t even know how to express my awe at what Ren does.  Truly special 🙌🏾
I love the cuts and the silence, the moments of reflection you left allow the emotion of the piece to sink in, the sound production on the props is perfect, the music ended and I'm writing this in quiet but I still feel it. Well done all around.
Oh my God this dude is amazing I really was wondering when I would find another musician that can actually point the problems of humans without sugar coating things. Love to: Ren Dax Valkuet Eminem  NF BMIKE Etc. I LOVE YOU ALL!
Absolutely one of the best & most talented musicians & performer this world has ever seen!
This is so peaky blinders
Mastergame
This is one of my favorite songs already
Ren is everything.
Holy fuck those last few lines. God damn this man is amazing.
du mit deim sein hast mich in mein gebo-pusht
BRO STARTED RAINING IN MY CITY WHILE STARTED RAINING IN THE VIDEO, THAT JUST HIT IT HARDER
Preach brother, preach. One day we'll get there, one day.  Everyone out there, stay strong.
Wow, I have no words beyond brilliant!
Part 3 didnt expect that
Sick!
I think the beauty of this is the collaboration.  It gives me musical and lyrical inspiration. Don't care anymore about confirmation. But the ability to create fascination. And make people think about transformation? WKD Sick boi. Keep coming with the information!❤
Ren bad ass.
Let's eat the rich.
'We're parasites inside a Petri dish with cannibal minds...' You are a genius!
I like your music. But I LOVE your longer art projects like this one!
Keep doing what you do! You have such powerful messages to the world.  I find myself blown away by the work that goes into every video you release.
Every piece of everything you do is just so beautiful, intricate and complicated yet simplicity in itself. Wonderful, art of the highest level.
Thank you sir ❤
Thankyou brother
This is my first tine listening to British rap ~peak~🗿
You would have made an excellent Christian Grey ❤ My God you are hott
Tommy Shelby's career change has been a intriguing one
Holy
the triqual we all wanted, but never deserved, super good work!
Commenting for the algo
Brilliant!
Ren is an incredible poet
You're amazing.
Boosting the algorithm, incredible piece of art ❤
This is soo fucking good. I watched without blinking. I listened without missing a word. 👏🏽👏🏽
I was today years old when I heard of Ren.  With 2:31 into knowing he existed, I am getting a white, British, Ill Mind kinda vibe. Anyone else?
Not lyrics. Poetry.
Шедевр!! От начала и до конца. Бескомпромиссный прорыв в мире музыки
A true masterpiece.
Holy hell this is great
A master of storytelling. Amazing work.
Ren's not just a musician; he's an artist on a philosophical level, too. Money Game really has something to say and while I'm sure plenty of people already know it, it's nice to hear put so well, visually and verbally.
Groundbreaking content! Ren, amazing video/lyrics.
Outstanding!!!
Wtf this is good...thanx for Sharing your creativity and timeless knowledge
this videos is AMAZING! Job well done.
i'm 43. love it.
That father sure knows how to ruin a genius....
I love the soFt keys on the piano part in the beginning that is very nice on the ears!! This whole thing…but when he got to the strings and he’s 40+ those strings just break ya down!! I lived this though!! He’s got so much ❤️ ❤❤heArt I love him
simply wow
Really just waiting on another luigi edit
Impressive
@ren -->  You are beyond years ahead of so many other artists.  Absolutely great story telling and completely artistic.
Just noticed Ren looks like Tommy Shelby
Absolute Genius.
WTF...... You're the understimated  genius of this Century, please jeep living and creating things like this, cheers lad
Who let Tommy Shelby cook?
Un Fucking Real.
Hole Video makes Vision thaugts about what i think. 7:50 Till 8:30. A huge conflict in my brain. Thank you  stepping this Artlike into it.
Exactly right.
where is that awesome catchy piano riff after the classical piece from? which song? right before he stopped the pianist? is that another Ren song? that riff was awesome.
Everyone is missing the point. This has nothing to do with music. (An it's pointless - as the artist knew upon creating)U'd miss the point!
FML give your cameraman a big raise please. that camera movement is a piece of art
That. Blew my mind. Wow.
THE WAY WE LIVE............ that hits hard
Well done lad... good job.
you are just talkin. try hip hop somed rhytm not just rhyme
we can all agree if ren dosent die of natural causes it probably so government wanted him gone
…
Why he kinda look like thomas shelby at this vid n dress
Just as deep as Part 2, even better in some aspects
My god, my fucking ears. How the fuck can everybody see this as a masterpiece? Maybe give the lyrics to somebody else and theyll be standard by todays grasps.  Dr. Suess is rolling his eyes
gwreiddio athrylith llwyr I chi frawd
great art.
Holy shit what an experience
Watched this live, it was worth the wait!
Ren = Only Masterpieces, no bullshii
so when are we overthrowing parliament? asking for a friend
This man has taken music and made something completely unique with it... Genuinely incredible
Those people lookin like the guys on the album cover for frances the mute
What is the classical piece’s name at the beginning?
W
This is a Masterpiece!
I cannot stop watching this! ❤
yes
what an honest legend, this man
The only problem I had with the video was his gun handling and trigger discipline was completely unsafe.  Even if the gun and bullets where fake you shouldn't handle a gun like that on video, it sets a bad example.  Otherwise great job and great song/story.
Those damn looong shots
I know you since the start you have come so far
Phenomenal. The chills when the string kick in 😮
Ordered. Love what I've heard so far. Keep going.
brother super god level i love it
Ob wir Menschen überleben.... Good question
Sounds wild
<3
Cheeeesch
Phenomenal 🙌
Simply breathtaking
Amazing lyrics. I'm glad people think like this. I thought I was alone.
Amazing
Ren I’m lost for words! I’m not sure why I got so emotional listening to this but I did! You are 1 of a kind and the true definition of a genius! Thank you 🙏
He looks like cillian merphy
no way!
Holy smokes! At 8:28 the rain starts and the floor was dry beforehand. This means he (they) did it in one take. Brilliant work.
now this is what we call ART
There are a few videos that exist on the internet where I sit completely still and am completely fixated for the duration. Ren is the creator of ALL of said videos.
Ren you have to much talent.  I love your music and then stories you tell.
Simple truth.
You are an amazing human being and insanely talented musician and performer!
Love it !!
Initiation?
True masterpiece ...❤❤❤
This indescribable, profound art would not be possible if you were not INDEPENDENT!  No corporate lable would EVER green-light this.  That's why you're so special.   NEVER CHANGE!
U have Learned this song every word. Everything is SubJeCT to change..🥺😥💔🥺😥🌱☝🏼
My 52nd b-day Rocktober 14th 😭

Amazing epic.
Cool story bro!
Brilliant! gotta watch whole story
Wow - Lyrically powerful - but I had to pull it back - this lyric is FIRE!!  inside a palace with a mountain of gold, but those riches turn to rumble, when perspective evolves!
Mastahpiece
I had to go back to experience this wonderful piece of art. Ren doesn't know how to disappoint. We are all his students and blessed to be in his wake. Awe inspiring always.
Idk what he’s shooting for but it sounds like a musical.
OMG, this is great, Thank you so much, what would we do w/o art?
fooking peaky blinders
nice
This is a masterpiece, I never thought it could get better than part 2. But this hit hard.
<3 i love  u
Amazing❤
Amazing
REN LOOK ME UP TRIS SKY   YOU ARE NOT ALONE ❤‍🩹
Bro looks like Thomas shelby
Musical version of  Cillian Murphy
3 bullets symbolizing part 3?
This is too gooooodddddddddddd❤
Should have a no.1 album in the uk this week 😁
Absolutely incredible.  REN IS THE DON!! ❤
I've watched this video well over a dozen times along with having the album on repeat and I still can't get enough. Absolutely one of the best artists out there.  Out of curiosity does anyone know if @RenMakesMusic is making the sheet music for this available? I would love to play this on piano.
Probably end up watching, listening to, everything Ren has made today. No idea how I've just discovered him. Instant fan. Mind blown. Lyrical genius, excellent musician, and a voice that draws you in deep. Haven't been this impressed since I first heard Eminem. 🔥💪💯
Money for souls
Wow absolutely masterful performance Ren!!!!!
No way, Money Game Part 3!?
What's interesting is that Jimmy never seemed to have his own ambition. Just seeking validation from his father.
I'm late to the party, but I'm f#cking glad I came! Just brilliant mate! Can't wait to get my copy of your album down here in Aussie land!
REN SHOULD WIN EVERY GRAMMYS IN EXISTENCE
Ngl he look like cillian murphy
Wow
Dammmmm
🖤
AND THE CROWD GOES WILD🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Next level 🎚️🤯🤓🤩
I love how Ren's songs articulates my opinions about society that I can't seem to put into words.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🤯
A masterpiece that evolved through time. A masterpiece that was nurtured, polished, perfected.
Amazing ❤
酷
Amazing song off an amazing album!
MASTERPIECE
I can only describe this piece of art as a blank canvas full of ideas.
Comment
wow
The tale of jenny and screech x money game x hi ren is what this feels like to me
Caught me because it sounded people like a musical. Honestly song was pretty basic and boring. The story sucked. Talking about made up borders. Everything is made up about society. The way you feel about your mum is “made up”. That’s why you build a wall or divert a river. Not made up after that.
You are one of the only true musical artists alive today. Bravo, sir. 👏
Wow😢 ..startled I am
👍
this is just perfect
Did I just see Thomas Shelby in a split second?
Just wow. This need guy needs to go viral.
Hip hop, spoken word, punk, theatre, and filmmaking all in one. Amazing again. 👊
I found Ren in 2019 and since then hes just non stop supprises me. Mate you are awesome keep it up.
A girl sent this to me. She's been a fan of his for a good long while and I have to admit this is very good.
YES I SAW THAT FINGER ON THE TRIGGER OF THE MONEY GAME AS SOON AS THE GUN WAS SHOWN
Какая-то чушь честно говоря.
WOW... WE NEED TO CHERISH REN FOR WHAT HE IS... A MUSICAL GENIUS
Yessir
more pls!
❤
Very nice.
Touching souls. Hundreds at a time.👏👏👏💎💎💎🔊🔊🔊
Deep..so True.
Thank You, Sir! While we are the most destructive species life on this planet will ever have had to endure, a tiny fraction of us proves that we can do better. Let us never give up on sincerely trying to make this fraction grow. Your art will encourage, inspire and strengthen us on our path.
Day 7 - Still good, what a week it's been. I'm hoping for a No #1 tomorrow for the album 🎉
I love this album so much.. there ist a song for every  feeling, situation and livelesson
masterpiece
This is the best 9.20 track by Ren since his last 9.20 track. I'm all in for the next 9.20 performance! Loved it!
The power of touching people soul,
All that is in the world, the lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life is not of the Father. It is all a clever lie spun to keep you occupied and distracted until it is too late. Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life." Turn to Him now (not religion). God is a person who loves you beyond your understanding. He has lived the greatest love story ever told, so that you could escape the corruption in this insane world. Let God prove to you that He is real. What have you got to lose? The world is a vapor, a mirage, a lie. Trade the lie for the truth. Trade death for life.
Genius 👌
you should have used plumb lines on the rain machine to get it just right .
✌️♥️
Exquisite
Wow! OMG! JUST wooooOOOWWWWW
Just love this
This is art.
I began to cry when the song ended and still got tears running down my face. It's just so...powerful and brutally true and honest.  This is a masterpiece, I wish more people would listen to you, to all that you say, would try to understand more, would try to change things. But I fear it will be just us, the 'sick' ones and those who are confronted with sickness, as parents, as nurses etc. I don't want to play that game. But I also really don't want to die. So I keep living on in between and every now and then there are people like you, masterpieces like this one, and they change just the littlest bit and maybe that's enough for now.  Wow, kind of a cryptic comment, I guess along the way I forget what I wanted to say.  Just so you know: I'm thankful, you make a difference.  Love, me ❤
When did Tommy Shelby started sing-rapping?
Ren, this is perfect! So deep, so impressive! Thank you for that!
Simply POWERFULL!
Everything in this video is aweosme, literally awe inspiring. As a 3D artist the camera work is magical. You dont want to see the camera movent, rather feel it. Even through sudden changes you feel it rather than see it. Add Rens real perspective and music; feel this all around.
Legend.
This is art
So proud of you Ren
Rens stuff for me is incomparable with anything I know. I enjoy it like I enjoy my favourite books. It makes my jaw drop and it feels really meaningful to me. I think he's very brave and ridiculously talented obviously. And what I love most about his stuff, it's uncompromising. It's all or nothing.
this dont have the same  edge as Hi Ren ...It feels like a parody of him making a parody of himself
Wooooh
Imdont worry about any dislikes on this video!.. that'll just be from my neighbours 😂 🎶 🎤 🔊 🔊 📢
Good!
Comment for algo, great song
Speaking of sheeps - I wonder if this guy is vaccinated !
Damn.
Nur ein Wort..... GENIAL!   Danke❤
f you love Ren then please checkout #Ren - #moneygame Part 3 #remix  (#SickBoi album)  starring #Renmakesmusic #Coldcut and #Prodigy released to coincide with launch of new album #SickBoi
Just Killin it...I went down a YouTube rabbit hole today when I accident came across Hi Ren....so I have been rolling through your music for the last 3 hours.  You are a genius bro.
Simply brilliant!
Doing it again and again. Ten.. modern William. Shakespeare,mixed w Mr. revere..listen to his words before it’s to late, or like he said..45 be our fate
go ren goooo!
yes
Man wtf is this what music was meant to be like? I've never heard anything like this.
Bro is a fucking genius
sombodie story in 9 min clip
I have a muscle disorder that will get worse over time and eventually I will need to take on my part time wheelchair life full time, and I am already prepared to love my life to it's fullest and live twice as long as the person in this story!
Oh my god this is the next sequel I didn't know I needed
45 and dead
Up
So in Moneygame 3 not sure if anyone has the question to it but i would really really love to have a full version of the written orchestra part if Ren could think of ever doing a whole track of it? . I totally fell in love with it and how Ren put it all together so please please could you put orchestra bit out for us on youtube i woud listen hours to it in a loop. Last time i got touched by music in a similar way was when watching Togo and listening to "Max Richter - On the Nature of Daylight". Thanks Ren for the huge effort  you put in everything you do forever your fan.
Great story as usual m8 luv your work..
Fuck ye this is awesome!
Since he released this song this has been on repeat in my head with murderer, I love Ren so much! PLUS the second time I heard it but in spotify it wasn't necessary the video, the song itself made me imagine Ren in a suit, the song it self it's elegant and beautiful ❤❤
I know you don't like big corporate companies but you need to sign some record or something. You really deserve to grow faster. Something like Billie Eilish.
렌..이번에도 천재..❤‍🔥
never heard this guy but this is great
It's more than masterpiece
The need for balance
Ur song break my ❤ and my hope.
Thomas Shelby be on some musical shit
Absolutely amazing
Whoa. Yes.
Took my breath away. I do not have words.
7:30 Omg he became Joe Hawley, jk, this song is really good
When I was 17 integrated
I love Ren's originality. I'd really like to see a collab with Tom Macdonald. Who knows what we would end up with. I do. Pure magic.
This is good. I need not say more.
I found him on TikTok with react videos, this is amazing, all of them are
This man is a god damn genius. Pure artistry.
So weak. This ain't music just some guy with money who made a shit video... bring back real music
crankgameplays got bars
This felt like a musical poem, except I can actually understand it. I like it.
First song I have heard from Ren.. absolute banger :o
Easily one of the best things I've experienced recently, going to have to watch this a few times to understand it even more.
part 3! wow
Mom, Ren dropped another money game song!!!
That was not 9 minutes
So “they” say … where words fail, music speaks …  and then there’s  Ren! Man ur creating  a whole new frikin ionosphere! Thank you!
Ren you did it again, a masterpiece!!
Thomas Shelby also sings!!
Tommy Shelby?
My 1st question is why load more than one round in the 45 if you plan to just shoot yourself then I felt like I could relate it’s because you know it’s one of the last few things your going to do so you just take your time -remember God loves you
The way he includes spoken poetry with lyricism, breaks, and sounds is really impactful. He's speaking the truth. Unfortunately many are living in a rat race with someone else's voice. Following their beliefs and their lies. And  when its too late you find you're miserable and tortured because you never chose to listen to your own voice or chose your own path. Having negative influences around him like his dad just lead to tragedy. I see it happen to my family or friends who lacked a positive role model in their life.  Money isn't corrupt, its a tool. It's humans who make it corrupt by abusing it. Very meaningful song and story.
It’s a story to be heard.
You did it again!
Blown away
Every song hits so hard. Ren you are incredible.
Trade a soul for money and fame… gets you a lot of consequences. Open your eyes and realize that this world a shame…
This kept me as captivated as when I first heard Blind Eyed and then spent the next few weeks discovering and consuming all your music
❤Thank u ZenRen💓 🕉💜
A cautionary tale about the dangers of greed and the importance of having a moral compass.
Great job!
I will make you one of my traphy music ❤
The story of Jimmy was fantastic But the speech about Money afterwards was quite great The ending spoke to me.. Quite heartfelt, saddening, ups and downs to reach the journey that everyone strives for with hardships that no one wants to experience but does
An inextricable trilogy
People need to hear you speak
Ayo the stepup from 1 to 2 was already impressive but this is on another level too, nice job!
Ren, I have a hook that came to me. I'd be glad if you could do something with it. I am not a musician nor can I sing so although I believe it to be good I have no means of doing anything with it. Not selling anything. You were one of 3 artists I think it would fit.
Nicely done mate 👍
Next gen slam poetry. Love it
Ren, I want to start by saying thank you. Your music is helping me through a rough time in my life.  Will the Demos/Fallen Angles/Tale of Jenny and Screech CDs listed on the merch site ever be available on vinyl? The only thing keeping me from buying the CDs is not having a CD player, but I'd buy them in a heartbeat in vinyl format.   Wishing you the best.
Just wow!!
You are Amazing!
sea shells
Thank you. Finding your art has made my life better.
Wow this left me at the edge of my chair. This was brilliant.
Wow, this is a masterpiece!
❤❤ keep up the good work 🎉🎉
see the thumbnail "what ? 9:19 video?"   9:19 later "what? already over?"  . beautiful storytelling and video production  😍
When is this guy getting a fire in the booth! I didn't think it was possible to top part 2 but here we are big up man.
not bad for a skizo
I’ve just ordered three vinals, go Ren!
Blows my mind every. time.
Story telling, Art, Music all rolled into one. A cautionary tale that will be ignored but should be headed.
Genius!❤
this song reminds me a lil bit of how much my father hates me
I grew up as a ward of the court ages 2-18. 2 failed adoptions, 3 name changes, 5 foster homes all by age 6. Then,  3 residential centers, 7 more foster homes, 3 group homes by age 18.  Even with all that, at least I learned an important lesson early on that many living with family never learn...  Acceptance doesn't mean shit. Wanting, craving, and doing anything for acceptance is typically bad.  I grew up and still live where I don't crave or care about acceptance, purely because I learned at an early age how acceptance is futile.  My not caring about acceptance has ALWAYS caused me problems, still does, but doesn't change how I live my life.  TY Ren for this song!
This hits different after the Gaza Genocide that's going on right now. Pray for Palestine.
Not surprised any more, your music and the videography is just sublime... can't get enough of your material,it's just something else laddie.  14.5/10
Normally i don't watch music videos or listen deeply to the lyrics, but with your music it's different. Both your music videos and lyrics are so captivating. I want to hear every word and understand every sentence. Thank you for sharing your talent with us.
We are all feeding off of your magnificent brain, best brain I’ve ever experienced.  Thank you so much
Absolutely amazing and masterful 🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯
Such a genuine artist. I loved Ren with all the busking and then heard 1990’s as I was born in 89’ so grew up in the 90’s and I’ve been hooked on his soul and passion to actually speak about deep topics. He’s not a superficial artist by any means. We need more artists like Ren.
Fantastic storytelling again. Extraordinary work as always. Many greetings from Germany
Absolutely Amazing!
SO good.
How does Ren constantly come up with the most wild stories, and incredible video concepts/ideas. I love it. Keep it up man!
Thank you for being you!
Bro made a sequel to the sequel to the song
Ren ,you are a pure genius
❤
The music, the video, the lyrics...awesome
He is Dr. Suess of Millennials and Gen Z
Damn this is amazing, you could write hamilton but better and more relevant.
Holy crap that was legendary
Ren Reminds me of a 2023 Thomas Shelby.
And we get into round 3
Bars!
One of the most underrated Artists cause he speaks the truth, love and respect form Pakistan!
I'm not crying you're crying!
crazy!
Superb Ren, in fact no, mindblowingly superb.
Let’s keep the algorithm Moving on this.
Absolutely brilliant!!!!
My life gets a little better when I see Ren has a new upload!
Well done!👍😮🤯🤩☝️
Crazy genius.
Watching this 45 times so the Youtube algorithm triggers and Ren can get paid in this money game
Wow
this isnt a song, this is art, this was not made to entertain us, it was made to entertain a concept, to teach us of it, this is a great song, by definition it is not as good as money game part 2, but in my opinion it beats it, you did it Ren, you beat your misunderstood masterpiece.
Un chef d'œuvre né d'une force folle
It's only been 2 seconds and I'm already mesmerized
What can be said that hasn’t been said already? You’re a rare gem, Ren. Well done to you and everyone that was part of making this masterpiece.
Already at 1 mil views! Congrats!
Needs to be watched 3 times to get the videography, music, lyrics ❤❤❤
This is awesome again 😮
No idea what or how I stumbled onto this, but that was awesome!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
The reason for life is just a fractal design, it's flowering bud, the question is, is ours a dud?
finally the trinity
<3
Another comment for the algorithm, this is amazing!
Why did it END??
The first 2 or 3 seconds reminds me of another song but I can't think of the name of it for the life of me!
Without wanting to sound patronising or overly complimentary, and without drawing parallels in a biblical sense, may I please say this, @RenMakesMusic... You are a true prophet of our era and generation! I wish for every person to experience your art and messages. May they awaken many of us who are trapped in the modern-day societal coma that we've come to accept as reality.
Yhea😁✌️
You and your team are increadible. This video is amazing in every aspect!!!!
Hey, Yo love the instrumentals, the camera work was top notch and love the message, although information is not a black and white input and people learn and use their brains not all the same. Hate is a factor of love (I hate seeing you in pain, I hate that nobody can help, I hate that we don't touch, speak, cuddle, or that you don't live for yourself) and with hate your values become less perfect and more open to bad things like selling drugs to pay for the bill or lying about how you really feel for someone cause of the fear to be alone ... processes are never perfect. There is no factory with a 0-defect output, and they are run by machines....... bbbbbut with all that aside. What did you mean "cause his age is the same"? (timecode 8:57) cause to me it sounds like his father's age as in the same age he died also at 45... but he died when Jemmy was 35? that's a 10-year gap bro.
🔥
HOLY-   Edit: This music video is a fuckin masterpiece. The slow spiral into insanity just hit different. AND THE LAST LINE WAS GOLD
✅
Heck yeah ren!!!
WOW
cool, you might wake up a lot of minions if this charts in the world. watch your soul lad
In my mind... the piano even sounds like an 8-bit video game music. The problem isn't about it being a game, but... that it is an extremely parasitic type of game, meanwhile... the wealthy are the narcissists who are not actually interested in ending poverty because they "imagine" everybody else is either far too lazy, therefore... "deserves" be poor... even to "imagine" the blessed will "always" become wealthy... so... no donations given... learn how to be an adult -- is their false narrative.
this shit is beautiful
im new to your music and i must say its captivating. i know im just a drop in your bucket but subbed :)
algo
This guy is a genius
HOLY SHIT DUDE  THIS IS INCREDIBLE
📈📈📈📈
You remind me of Donald William Shimoda
this song gives me an emotion that doesn't exist
greetings from germany. i found you a couple days befor and your music does something with me i only know from 2 other guys from germany. I feel like someone understand me, my andf our life. This is a feeling i have only at your music and the music of "Lance Butters" and "Crystal F" from germany. and if im together with my best friends. Thank u for ur work, ur thougts and ur music.

WOW… just WOW!
<3
powerfull art
Ahhh 😱 how did I miss part 2!!!!😅❤
Another masterpiece Ren😊....I got proper chills at the end!!!
bye
I'd love to share it with friends who doesn't speak english very well, would be great if subtitles where integrated on youtube / open to participation to translate it !
Pure art. I respect your music!
Discoverd you because of the she sells seashes luigi meme and I can only say I am glad that I did… awsome songs and lyrics aswell
is this thomas shelby
A work of art at its highest expression, Greetings from Argentina
Watrmalone is here
oh the music video is absolutly amazing, i really like it!
Officially added every available version and an extra digital copy to support getting Ren to #1. He is so close each of us can actually make the difference to get him there. Its absolutely nuts how close he is to #1. Im officially at 8 or 9 copies of the album lol. Lets push! Getting this amazing guy to #1 would be a massive victory for all Ren fans and the entire music industry. Love Rick, but this needs to go to our Sick Boi
Bro....I couldn't agree more. I'm at a point where all I want to do is flip the system upsidedown or get out of it. The rat race, the whole made up charade is such a waste of life. I'm still trying to figure out the real solution. Until then, it's just watching everything you are singing about unfold and it's so tiresome and infuriating. I hate submitting to it everyday for the dollar, and watching masses get herded like sheep to the slaughter.
using this song as a guide on how to live my life. thanks
Wow! Always amazing but this one is at the top! I sat captivated the entire time! ❤
W
you are very clever
i liked how at the parts where he just talked he put it in a rhyme scheme to analyze the brain   before he pulled the trigger of the money game
ren people are destructive it's sad
I think he should get into acting
N° 1
Wow.
Bravo 😢 👏
Just wow ❤
Damn that is wild
Wow
Incredible ❤
trailer of %75 man's life
Ren where have y'all been
Insane.
Aint no way we finally got part 3, kinda wish i also had a 45. with me
SHE SELLS SEASHELLS ON A SEASHORE!!!
Incrível. Sem palavras. Chamar essa obra de arte de música seria rebaixar essa obra incrível, pq nada se enquadraria tão bem na definição de "arte" doq isso. Parabéns Ren, um dia eu sonho em ser do seu patamar artístico e de criatividade <3
Com for alg
And thus YouTube was redeemed.
We should point the mirror at are selfs ,because we’re all part off this big old money game
She sells sea shells under the shore...
Fuuuck!!! Amazing!!!!
I have no Idea who you are but this is amazing and I will have to watch everything else.
Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy 1 years old and his first words were "Mine, mine, gimme!" 2 years old he was walking, 3 years old walking quickly 4 years old he was running 'round the pavements of his city 5 years old and his daddy told him "Listen here, son You gotta learn to be a man, a man, he works for what he wants" 6 years old and he’s reading, writing, top of the bunch And when he's 7, his progression made him student number 1 8 years old and he’s praised for unusual grades 9, his parents pay for private school to nurturе the flame 10, 11, 12, 13, he ascеnds and ascends His daddy tells him "Son, money is the means to all ends" 14, solving complex mathematic equations At 15, IQ 150, still elevating 16, he develops complex software code That detects weaknesses in cyber security protocols 17, and he sells his vision keeping a share Not yet an adult, but he's practically a millionaire 18, and his daddy tells him "Now you're a man This world don't give a damn about you, so take all that you can" 19, he turns a profit stocks and shares invest in product 20, double-down deposits, 21, his income rockets 22, he learns that truth is just an obstacle to wealth If you manipulate the data, then a lie will sell itself 23, a life of luxury, crystal and cocaine 24, he makes the Forbes list, they're applauding his name 25, and his daddy tells him, "Listen here, son While you are sitting in that palace, that don't mean that you won" 26, a business shift, he switches business to arms He's 27, dealing nuclear and shells in Iran 28, inside the Senate money bought him a seat He's 29, a role of the council in the president's suite Now he’s 30, his daddy says "You're losing the race You're just a servant to the king, not even in second place" 31, a big maneuver for his daddy’s approval Moving imports over borders from the exports out of Cuba 32, moving grams, growing kilos to tonnes He's 33, filling warehouses with powder and guns 34, turf war with nobody to stop it Blind eye from the po-po inside of his pocket 35, he gets a call, "I'm sorry son It's your father, had a heart attack, I'm sorry, he’s gone" 36, getting pissed up, abusing his product 37, eyes glazed, disposition demonic 38, with a prostitute, a moment of passion Heating up a silver spoon and then chasing the dragon 39, getting reckless and hungry for power Daddy’s words still driving him to kill and devour He makes a move against the cartel, but the strategy's flawed They retaliate and leave him in a hospital ward A bullet buried in his vertebra and one in his leg The doctor sighs and says "I don’t think you’ll be walking again", fuck  [Verse 2] Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy He was 40, and he cursed the words "Mine, mine, gimme" 41, he wasn’t walking, 42, not walking quickly 43, never running 'round the pavements of his city 44 inside a palace with a mountain of gold But those riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves Weighing heavy on his conscience is the value of gold Lamborghini for a life, trading money for souls Jimmy followed the code inside the land of the free Put your hand inside the cookie jar, take more than you need And his example is exaggerated versions of me And it's a version of him, and it's a version of she And it's a version of you, there’s no escaping the blame The way we live is parasitic, fuck the money and fame! Cut the music!  [Verse 3] This isn’t entertainment, this is real-life The way we live is lunacy, community, it declines We're hyperpolarized, we're always fighting, and we divide Truth is less important than the money that we design? Money's an invention, politics from our invention They all come from peoples' ideas, did I mention? Borders? An invention, law, and order fuel the tension That leads to people killing each other. My solution? Everything is subject to change We could build utopias if individuals were taught to use their brains But if we teach kids in school to always be sheep And put themselves before the herd if there's more money for me Then there’s no future I see, where the humans survive We're parasites inside a Petri dish with cannibal minds Mold will grow upon a surface, then consumes till it dies And our fate could be the same without this story for the wise [Outro] 45, Jimmy comes home out of the rain Soaking wet upon a wheelchair, drinking again He is everything he wants, he has fortune and fame He’s a fortunate fool with an unfortunate fate With a 45 caliber aimed at his brain 45 - a fitting number, 'cause his age is the same Hears the words of his father; "It's such a damn shame" Then he presses on the trigger of a money game
А чё так круто то?(комент для продвижения)
real shit dude
masterpiece!!!
For the algorithm, this is great.
I'm just letting you know that I just paid in order to post something to your live feed didn't post it took my money and all I wanted to say was high so just to let you know this is sort of crazy not rich which is fine but seriously I have to go to another video in order to post what I wanted like I don't feel like this is you @renmakesrealmusic 😢
I'm so confused I'm clicking on everything and it's saying I have to pay?
I am so enamored by the art emerging from  Ren and Samuel. It's thought-provoking and inspiring. As an aspiring artist who sold out over 15 years ago many of the topics are incredibly easy to relate to, including the unique perspective of someone who spends their lives living on the periphery of society - a great place to be to get a real view of the world and its machinations. While similar thematically to Handlebars by Flobots, this piece does a much better service by aiming the measage directly at the culprits - all of us. Consumerism and capitalism drive a very high percentage of people. Hell, look at all of the parasitic/arguably somewhat symbiotic nature of the Youtube reaction community as an example. Art being a commodity to pander. That said, what are the tangible steps out of this mess? Pointing out a societal disfunction is one thing, the path out is a much more labourious road. We are all monkeys in shoes; our enlightened sides always at war with our basic primal instincts. Figuring out how those two sides of the same coin (loosely quoting Ren) can work together to our benefit is the real trick. You can rightfully call me a cynic, but i fear that such a feat is beyond the capabilities of our current world.
THE TRILOGY IS COMPLETE YES
YOU NEVER DISAPPOINT!
There are no words that can describe how that whole last bit of the song made me feel
Unrivalled, relentlessly, astonishing, - REN
Won't say ages or time-frames but this hit me hard fuçk real life I hate it
Spectacular!!!   Sheer beauty.
Please don't ever stop.
My god ren you killed it on this one with such truth and the amazing storytelling which you do so well. What a MASTERPIECE!!
he looks like cillian murphy in peaky blinders
YOOOOOOOOOO PART 3 DROPPED YIPPEEEEEEE
Throw sex drugs and rock 'n' roll in there. The illuminati will always try to get you signing in the background like Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory when the other factory guy shows up and whispers in your ear.
for the alg
Makes me realize how fast life goes by except for I was a metal rap artist😂❤
Mukemmelsin Ren
Finally. Back to this genre ❤️
if cyllian murphy was a musician
A true masterpiece 👏 ✨️ ❤🎉
Your musics are insanely good and emotive. You're an artist I discovered a bit less than a year ago and I can't stop listening to those masterpieces you keep creating. I never post any comment, but I thought your video was befitting of a comment.
Ren going places
Dam Luigi coming through with the drops
Great story bro
Wow
Perfection!
That was fucking cool!😎🏋️‍♀️
nice art
noice par 3 after 3 years fitting
Been following & listening to Ren since last year. He's an absolute genius. So much respect & admiration for him. So happy that he's getting the credit & recognition for his amazing talent ❤
I'm leaving my comment here too
Honestly it maybe one of the highest quality content I've seen on this platform
Damn...al the songs from this guy are masterpieces!!!
❤❤❤ This is important art, much needed art.
Thank you for your art, the world needs more of your words than the words of Cardi B, Ice Spice, and all the other garbage of the world.
I think Ren could be on Broadway telling his stories the way he does. Unbelievably talented.
Is Cillian Murphy your father?
REN  has completely changed hiphop. Hes an elite in his field
Just EPIC... This literally deserves an award!
Ren does it again!
Xtra comment at 1.5million for youtube's all guy rhythm. Da iawn  Ren. Gwych!!
1 & 1/2 million views & its not a full week yet....Wow🔥🔥
I comment for the algorithm too, usually don't do.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻💚💚💚👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Insanely good
I Like !!!
wow
FINALLY!
Nice.
Best music out of all i have found on youtube. Absolutely amazing and beautiful to listen to what you do ren thank you ❤
Ren, you are the king of stories. I would watch a whole Money Game film. ❤❤
Killin it dude
Nobody is making moves like Ren right now.
Wow,
Wow.
Crazy good !
Ren washi bach pidin mawr ….. ti’n ffocin amazing met. Thanks for playing my recommendation GLC on twitch haha. Spoke to Sam the weekend …. The camera work, directing, acting, performance, props, location, costume, lighting ….. everything about this video from a person who’s been in TV and Film for over 20 yrs and my first ever job was the first series of Skins there is absolutely nothing I would have changed about this video ….. it’s PERFECTION mate. It’s also comforting to see you surrounded by such humble and beautiful people xxxx I bloody love Brigita she’s stunning xxx
🎉amazing ❤
Women: EWW NO, they show unrealistic beauty standrads on TV Men: I need to look like ren, start buffing now
I doubt this was intentional, but the globe stopped spinning when Jimmy got the news of his father's death.
My jaw is on the floor best piece of art I've ever seen
Ren I found your work in a hospital. I was on a psychiatric ward as a patient and a nurse recommended me 'Hi Ren'. I was in a dark place emotionally, wracked with worry about the state of our world.  The Israel and Palestine conflict worsening its important now more than ever for us all collectively to find our humanity. I find hope in your music and I'm eternally grateful. Much love :)
45 is also a fitting number for another reason!  Well done Ren and team, another great song. Loved the strings
POETRY!
Anyone else get the chills before the song even started? Just me, doubt it! Let’s get it REN!!!!
Another one that hits the spot! 🙌🏽
Stunning.
Wow.
Amazing
That was amazing
This... I.... I want to say something moving, but I'm just so wowed by your lyrical genius and creativity. Every single video hits something different. Each soul speaks to someone in one way or another.   I'm so glad a friend shared your music with me earlier in the year
We'll know we are in deep shit if we ever go above Money Game Part 10.
Peaky and the Blinders
🔥
ren you are an animal i'd love to , i'd love to hear you do an upbeat lil peep song
Wow !!
🎉🎉🎉
Обезумевшая реальность Благодарю!
dis some good shit, lawd this dood can perform
You're such a talented author! But it hurts so deeply when I'm watching your videos, so I need to feel brave enough to press play again.
This is insane. From the production quality to the Storytelling techniques while everything matching with the song, it's a perfect outcome. And the best part is, it's not-relatable, but relatable. A Masterpiece.
No 2 in Uk album charts… but Rick Astley at no 1 guys!!! Hey I loved a dance to Never gonna give you up! But it’s 2023 how do we make him no1 by Sunday???
REN NEVER CEASES TO AMAZE ME how talented he is, and I love the different sides to REN  . Storytelling is amazing.
Thank you for starting this for first time
Awesome!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
You look like murphy
HE PLAYS PIANO TOOOO WHATTT
Impressive
Need more money to flap
Nothing but amazing! Thank you!
amazing, simply amazing
And the truth has been spoken
Bitcoin fixes this
This made me cry 🤍 we all know a Jimmy
♥️♾️4AL000111
I cant believe it happened again
1.4mill views in 5 days…..I reckon I must be the .4 alone. Watched this so many times.
Love it man ! 💯💯🔥😪
damn
I have nothing to say but "Wow"
Im blown away
I think it’s dumb how the verification check has changed to why your verified (music etc) because people are multidimensional.   Regardless I love this song and I’m rambling for the algorhythm too. ❤.
sick as always!
REN is so creative 👏
could have been called the tale of Jimmy but money game pt3 is also fitting
If I become a teacher I'll show this to kids.
Very nice, Is it possible to add subtitles in French? To better understand certain subtleties of music, thanks !
This is very well done! As an American, I had to double take on some of the lines to understand the accent. But this was art 🎉
This is insane
Tears. Brilliant.💥❤️🙏
Another level! Remarkable
Best
Sick boi going to be this weeks no1 album in the UK 🇬🇧  congrats ren, all without a label or promotion, you sir are amazing.
I can’t stop watching this masterpiece , absolutely magnificent!! Love this dude
Another level
Brilliant
Love the angles of the shots and how they flow. Great video!
Wait, aren't you part of the money game too? Like you sell albums and stuff
It’s a good thing you didn’t get that contract years ago. Your talent is too big for a tiny corporate box.
Also, am I the only one who doesnt think  he looks like Cillian Murphy? 🤷‍♀️ like, at all?
I love this. Your creativity and capacity for art is parmount and oh so inspiring. ❤❤❤
His timing is impeccable. The pauses long enough to build tension and anticipation but not too long to get frustrated and bored. It's captivating.  And the music is just perfection telling a story all of its own.
rap opera, fantastic
Ive tried and failed at music the respected is who chose it ... u make my soul and music better with ur music and lyrics ive said enough but anyway i hold u in high respect
I cannot wait for this video to go truly viral; it is a masterpiece. ❤ I cannot stop listening to every song on this amazing album.  Each and every song is a banger.  And I expect Uninvited to become a pop #1 hit.
Im my head ur a true artist
❤❤❤❤
Wow... this is...... GREAT!!
Once again, beautiful
Bravo love masterpiece of story teller
This is like its own Broadway musical. Fuckin fantastic
This is forgettable

This genius has done it again 👏 LOVE IT
you're not supposed to know this
Generational curse anthem 🫠🖤
HELP NEEDED - For what might be a new community page I might need some help of some WordPress connaiseurs...
This is one of the most beautiful things I have ever listened to and seen.
Amazing!   I love how his empathy shows so clearly in some of his songs, how he's able to create a cast of characters is fantastical. Still much more to come ! ❤
Day 6 - Never gunna run around and desert it

Chills!!! Chills everywhere. An absolute masterpiece of deep, meaningful art!!  👏
Ren really is a master at his craft
Simply amazing. Also I see the BBC site have the story of Ren and Rick Astley competing for #1 in the UK charts.  It’s a nice piece.
The way this builds up kinda reminds me of the song “Handlebars” by Flobots. Money game however, is a masterpiece, from the earlier songs to the treasure hunt to this, I’m in awe. Great job again and this journey has truly given me a different perspective of how I view life and myself. The change starts with us, and will impact the generations that follow.
Lived it thought it. Glad to see more saying it at this scale. Hope if anything it makes those whom have created this situation around us, stop and start to re-think, what it truly means to live and be alive. :) Thanks Ren, love your stuff. :)
I was going to say something comically mean, but wow this is amazing
people who actually get more than others aren't the problem, there's always been rich - it's the damn system that keeps telling us "everyone should try to do that" is! It keeps people from overthrowing the damned rich. All the guys out there who think "if I'm just focused enough, I can become rich and famous!" - NO, YOU WON'T! EVER! And focus, intellect or wisdom all mean shit. If your parents were rich, you'll be rich.
goosebumps, the entire time
Stunning. I love when an artist exploit what I feel and put it in words. REN IS GREAT FOR ME
This is a masterpiece
There should be a petition to ask Ren to make the next James Bond movies Theme Song!
Not really a song to blasé on the system though...
Loved the South Park reference
This is the best thing I've ever watched love Ren so much much love from Saskatchewan Canada!
What a performance!!! One more One Man Show!.. He is not only an ingenuous musician and poet but an actor as well!! I keep wondering how he can be THAT good at things every one of which takes a whole life even for a gifted individual to become a pro...
Masterpiece
I'm 47. Been to a lot of festivals. Seen damn near every band I've ever wanted. I use to play drums. Seen a lot of local band. This song is without a doubt the best song and video I have ever seen.
He looks like Cillian Murphy 😂
This is so amazing and emotional. Thanks
Ren woke up flying today hearing sikboi no 2 in uk mainstream charts now were rollin! All renegades take me hat off them all mate x
노래 넘 좋아요
😮 amazing 🤩
Seeing the new album going through the roof of the charts makes me emotional af. It shows me in those days that art is still alive, that people actually listen to music and cherish dedication and autheticity. In a world full of fakes, influencer, short attention content and missleading informations this sick boi prevails with raw competence. Keep it up, Ren - Thank you for everything!
Just read a news feed that says midweek album sales for UK number 1 album is currently only 400 sales difference between Ren and Rick Astley. Heavyweight battle.  So close. As of Wednesday 18th October. Fingers crossed for  you Ren.
It was just a masterpiece; I loved every second of it!
Amazing song and video.  And, man, The Beano Annual from 1987 on the desk of the 14-year-old?  That hits.  I was 14 in 1987.
Just incredible. The story telling, rap and message is just spot on. Keep doing what you do REN, it’s like watching a  grand master at work.  The visuals also are always so creative. Who needs a record company when you are this good. A real inspiration to anyone out there.

One of the best ones ❤
LET'S FUCKING GOOOOO
Damn the beginning of this song tricked me into thinking I had just entered a castle in the snes era Mario games 😂
The classical touch is superb
Shakespeare of our time!
Master piece and a half haha
The poor lady violinist didn't keep it dry..
Maybe a mini genius this.
What episode of Peaky Blinders is this? (JK w/ love)
You are amazing 🙌🏻❤️ plz Come to norway 🙌🏻❤️
You should learn about Bitcoin and you will see a much brighter future.
Чертгвски хорош
I'm 65 years of age. All I can say is wow, a masterpiece
Someone else thinking he kinda looks like Peaky Blinders guy
Wauw ❤
My first time watching this one. Haven't gotten all the way thru yet. I've restarted it about 5 times now. The one thing I have realized, without a doubt @renmakesmusic, is that you are a certifiable genius. This journey you are taking us on, especially the money game, is a true work of art. But it's not just that; it's how you've released your tracks and how they have been found by others. Your artistry and what you have done is beyond incredible. I would say you are the first person to put on a global treasure hunt/play/psychological experience ever. More so, you did it with meaningful messages and real life experiences. You have written this over years and are letting us episodically see your play. you wrote us an incredible story, world, and history, that is being played out thru your music, videos, artistry, passion, pain, loss, triumph, realization, understanding, and growth The way you work your songs into one another is almost as if its lore. From violet, screech and Jenny to their constant references or nick names relating to your past and life, to your incredibly raw, and honestly humbling songs and references to your friend Joe. Your style of writing mixed with your overwhelming life experience and your wealth of musical knowledge has led you to something that is rarely seen. Remember thru all of this that you need to be healthy to continue this and that is most important. Never let anyone put expectations on you as this goes on. Not your fans, not venue's, not labels, no one. I think I speak for all of us when I say, you being able to do what you feel and want with your creative ability is not only more then enough but, something we are grateful you are sharing with us and allowing us to be apart of and experience. In other words, thank you for everything you have made and your unending reach of positivity, to not only your fans but everyone, just because they exist, Just, as people. That in and of itself is a rare find now a days. Thank you kind sir, the world could learn a lot from you, I just hope it does.
One of the best artists of our time. Your perspective is similar to mine, just more thought out. As I get older, I believe more and more in this thought: apathy is the killer of good, not evil.
Wow! Just wow!
Sheesh I’m glad this video came across my feed
ace2b
Wow this is so goood, what a masterpiece do more Stuff like this please❤
Wow great video and song, and blowing up like Hi Ren by looks of it. I was worried for the violinist on the left, as it looked like she was getting a little wet? Maybe not her violin (hard to judge) but surely her bow had to be close enough to be getting some water on it.
Love this this is real and true facts ❤❤❤
Ikeep coming back
I almost passed you by but your message pulled me in. Well said and done!
I absorb Music slowly. I take my time. On first view I take in the big picture, I get the feel of it. Money Game 3 included. A few details got through but there was so much to take in.   I stepped back to regroup, got my head around the visuals via your twitch, a little BTS, a couple of reactions, and a couple uninterrupted "listen only" sessions. I came  back ready to immerse myself in the whole story.   Brilliant! Everything! The set and lighting design, acting, blocking, music, musicians, camera work, costuming, props, pre-production, PRECISION, dedication, lyrics, message, delivery, and intention.   Thank you for this groundbreaking musical film.    🌍🌎🌏🌍🌎🌏🌎 🌬️🌬️🌬️🌬️🌬️🌬️🌬️ 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵
1.4m views in 5 days ? , nah man the entire world needs to hear this.
Take it from here kids: yes, money is important but it shouldn't be centre point of your life. Keep an eye on it to fulfill your dreams but don't hord it (rule of thumb: put the money you need aside and for the rest: put half of the money you gain in your savings and spend the other half on things that make you truely happy, like going out for dinner with friends).  Now if you'll excuse me, I'll be concentraitin on becoming a teacher for the next years :)
rain rain rain
The true ist so simple
It literally will end up as Givers versus Takers :-( Be happy if there's a roof and utilities where you live Everyone please stay safe and well🙏🙏
Nothing but massive respect for this guy...
no way a Brit would off himself with a Colt 1911
oi y so good
I can’t stop watching!!! Ahh! I did show like 2 friends today. We all sat down and it was like watching my very own reaction video!! Boom!! 🎉
We need a full concert of the whole thing together. It would be amazingly tragic
I feel like this is the cat in the hat if he was depressed.
Yo
This is absolutely beautiful, prime art and genius commentary. Kudos to Ren for upping the ante once again!
Came a long fucking way from the Seashores
nice
Our prophet I bow down. Love you.
Brilliant ❤
I want to be like ren 1day you have inspired me
Absolutely phenomenal, as always.  A true artist.
Absolute genius❤❤
A masterpiece with a message.
Only song I could get behind was animal flow! I am 40 so I guess I don't get it..
I really just appreciate how much variety you have. I feel like a lot of book videos are just the same 20 books then maybe three others (or some larger equivalent to that). It was SO COOL seeing so many unique reads and such a small amount of romance. I was DROOOOLING over all the horror and fantasy you had. I also loved how many classics there were ❤
Yooo this dude is the definition of talent, putting music , cinema and story telling together ❤❤❤❤
Every time I watch this magnum opus, I keep expecting Ren to finish the line "My solution?" with the words "an intervention!" as he takes off his jacket. 💕
crumbs: none
The album is missing what went wrong part 1 and part 2
Nah this is unbelievable! And people say good music doesn’t exist anymore???!
Bro, you are an absolute national treasure! Don't ever think otherwise.
I still don't think a simple thumbs up gives Ren enough credit. Each new masterpiece is groundbreaking.
日本語訳 （I love this song so much that I'll post the Japanese translation. BECOME POPLAR）  ジミーという名の少年について話そう 1歳、最初の言葉は「オレの、オレの、ちょうだい！」 2歳、歩けるようになり、3歳で急速に歩く 4歳、都市の歩道を駆け回る 5歳、父親が彼に言った、「聞け、息子よ　男になら欲しいもののために働くんだ」  6歳、読み書きが得意になり、 7歳で学校の成績は1位 8歳、異例の成績で称賛される 9歳、両親が私立学校の費用を支払い、情熱を育む 10、11、12、13、彼は昇進し続ける 父親が彼に言った、「息子よ、金がすべてなのだ」  14歳、複難な数学の方程式を解く 15、IQは150で、まだ上昇中 16歳、複雑なソフトウェアコードを開発 サイバーセキュリティプロトコルの脆弱性を検出する 17歳、彼はビジョンを売り、 まだ大人ではないが、ほぼ百万長者 18歳、父親が彼に言った、 「今やお前は男だ　この世界はお前には何もかまわない、だからできる限り奪い取れ」 19歳、彼は利益を上げ、 株式とシェアに投資 20、デポジットを倍にする 21、収入が急上昇し、 22歳で彼は真実は富にとって障害だと学ぶ データを操作すれば、嘘そのものが売れる  23歳、贅沢な生活、 クリスタルとコカイン 24歳、フォーブスのリストに載り、 彼の名前を称賛 25歳、父親が彼に言った、 「聞いてくれ息子よ、お前が自分の宮殿に座っているとき、お前はまだ何も得られていない」 26歳、ビジネスを切り替え、武器のビジネスに切り替える 27歳、イランで核兵器と砲弾を売る 28歳、上院議員は金で彼に議席を与えた 29歳、大統領の評議会の役割が甘美だ  30歳になり、父親は言う、 「お前はレースに負けている。お前はただの王に仕えるしもべだ、2位ですらない」 31歳、父親の承認を得るための大きな策略 キューバの輸出から輸入への移動 32歳、グラムを移動し、キログラムからトンまで育てる 33歳、粉と銃で倉庫を埋める 34歳、誰も止めない縄張り争い ポポ（警察のスラング）は目を瞑る　ポケットの中に  35歳 - 電話がかかってきた、 「ごめんねわたしの息子よ、 お父さんが心臓発作で亡くなった、ごめんね」 36歳 - 酔って商品を乱用する 37歳 - 目がうるみ、鬼のような性格 38歳 - 売春婦との情熱の瞬間 銀のスプーンを温めてドラゴンを追いかける 39歳 -無謀で権力に飢えている  パパの言葉が依然として彼を殺し、貪り食うように駆り立てている  カルテル（脱法組織）に反対する動きをするが、戦略に欠陥がある  彼らは報復し、彼を病棟に置き去りに 銃弾は脊椎に、もう1つは足に埋まる 椎間板に弾丸が埋まり、脚にも1発 医者はため息をつき、もう歩けないと言う  ジミーという名前の少年について話そう 彼は40歳で、「オレの、オレの、ちょうだい！」と呪う 41歳、歩けない、42歳、急いで歩けない 43歳、自分の街の歩道を走り回ることはない 44歳、自分の宮殿に山のような金がある しかし、視点が変わると富はがれきに変わる 彼の良心に重くのしかかる金の価値 人生そのもののランボルギーニを命のため金にする しかし、ジミーは自由の国の中で指示に従う クッキージャー（豚の貯金箱）に手を突っ込み、必要以上に取る  そう、彼は私たちの誇張されたバージョンさ そしてそれは彼のバージョンであり、彼女のバージョンであり、あなたのバージョンだ、責任からは逃れられないよ 私たちの生き方は寄生虫だ、お金と名声はくたばれ  音楽を止めろ  これはエンターテインメントではない、これは現実だ 私たちの生き方は狂気だ、コミュニティは減少していく 過度に偏極化され-常に争い、それから分かれていく 真実はお金よりも重要ではないのか？ お金は発明で、政治は発明から来る それらはすべて人々のアイデアから来る 言ったか？ 国境も発明だ、法と秩序は緊張を燃料とする それが人々が互いに殺すことにつながる  私の解決策 すべては変化の対象だ 個人が頭を使う方法を教えれば、ユートピアを築くことができる しかし、学校で子供たちに常に羊になることを教えるなら 自分自身を群れの前に置き、私たちにはもっとお金があるならば 私たちが生きる未来は見当たらない 私たちはペトリディッシュの中の寄生虫だ 人間の運命も同じかもしれない、 だから賢い者のための物語なのだ  45歳、ジミーは雨の中から帰宅する 再び飲む車椅子でずぶ濡れになりながら 彼が欲しいものは何でも持っている、 幸運と名声だ 彼は幸運なばかで、不幸な運命を持っている 45口径の銃が 彼の脳に向けられているのを聞く 45歳、彼の年齢と同じ数字だ 父の声が聞こえる、「まったくもって残念だ」  それからジミーは「マネーゲーム」のトリガーを押す
Outstanding yet again young man.
Damn where the hell did this come and why did i like it so much
Hardest line in the song: 6:25
Such an amazing piece of art right here. Truly speaks to some of the struggles we have in society at the moment and that each of us is a part of it. This really spoke to me. Thank you for the creation
Bloody hell, REN goes so deep something that I end up with NOSEBLEEDS from all the pressure, but I love it ❤🎉
beautiful !!! Pure brilliance... Ren, you a larger than you think!
Cómo te explico? Me encanta tu trabajo! Cada vez mejor ❤
This gives me chills.. what a Masterpiece!
Ren you are unbelievable. Keep it up!
Masterpiece
Ren, you are fucking amazing
😦👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻

holly, the peaky blinder?
なんだこれはエグすぎるわ日本語訳出して日本人にも知ってもらいたい
What a show. What a showman!!! What a journey!!!    More!!!!
freaking love this, gave me chill
YEAH AND THE SOUND OF MUSIC CUZ 🎶 MY GOD GIVEN AMERICAN RIGHTS PERIOD EXCLAMATION POINTS ‼️ 👉 👈 👇 😳 🙌 ‼️
Absolutely brilliant. Best artist of our day hands down
This mofo....be slapping
He looks like a mix of Tommy Shelby and Billy Kimber
I like this series
Ey Ren, I'm late to the party but daym my guy your material is 🔥 probably too much truth for mainstream. Howdy from Texas ✌️
💙💙💙😊
Music like this can actually change the world!
Excellent
❤
Joh 8.12  Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
I haven't even figured out how to process this video yet. It's simply... incredibly good. The story, the blocking, the concept, the raw lyricism. It's not just music. It's not a music video. It's not a short film. But somehow it's all of them. And it's meaningful and devastatingly emotional. Just... HOW!?!?!?!?!
You make art!!  Amazing
Ren, I’m sure I have writ this before and I’ll now write it again. You’re a true artist my friend. You inspire my desire to tell the truth with my art, to tell the truth from a place from the deep beneath my heart.
Beautiful, insightful, gutrenching, and glorious. Thank you for this message
Much love from Sudbury Ontario Canada
Is it just me or does he look like Mike Myers? 😂😂
wow
Thought this would be interesting... but wow. I'm very impressed. Better go back and check the first 2 when I can!
Such genius!  You never fail to amaze me.   Thank you!
Oh god...
Purely brilliant, and very well said my friend. Much respect from a fan in So-Cal.
Yet again, what an artist.
Just wish more people would see this, feel the emotion, and learn from some perspective.
This is more than just entertainment, a message and call to action. Not just for any one country or person. Everyone has a piece to play and your music is just the first voice to break through the white noise
This is an absolutely beautiful work of art Ren 🖤
Every Russian rap song before 2010 resembles this one
g.NIOUS
You're a legend, Ren. One of the best nowadays, original, who gives his best in every word.
Brilliant as always.
"Jimmy followed the code, inside the land of the free: Put your hand inside the cookie jar, take more than you need."
I just found your music today & I've been listening to your catalogue all day, I normally hate British rappers, simply because the accent doesn't fit well in HipHop, but you, your concepts, how you Rap & paint pictures is something else 👏, I think you would work well with Joyner or Eminem, you're to creative not too, I hope you get that number 1 spot on the album chart. Keep up the great work 👍
I ate  crayons as a child! After listening to this song I still eat crayons 🖍️
Beautiful love it both the video clip & music 🔥📽️🎤
This is true ART!
So good. Thank you
I love how when ren ducks underneath the arm dealers shaking hands. The frame looks like a M..  wow..just wow to this timeless master piece that were all privileged to experience.. I'm sure some folk have taken a back seat on the money game after watching this
I think a tom McDonald or someone else should make a rebudle to this song. Except criticizing the European communist.
Holy shit that was amazing
Best musician ever
Ren able to play piano??? :0
Three years after the last one, Ren has done it again. A song for the ages, especially in these times
Awesome
OOF... i wasn't ready... 👏👏
First time listening  to this. That's unique. Awesome. Different... got the feeling ✌❕🔥💞
MONEY............ is the infective VIRUS that cursed all Humans SO........ DONT..... be a..... human!
Ab"soul"utely respect your artistry as I am reassured  humanity still has a say. Unfortunately, I've been  a silent witness. Unfortunate that I have held myself back from expressing what was in  my heart. I was swayed by fears and doubts as to wonder if humanity was worth saving. I stand corrected. Keep fighting the good fight as you are on the right path. But of course you don't need my or anyone else's validation to understand what's innately within your heart. Thank you.
Tomas shelby ta frio e artista!
I love you, Ren, your everything I feel. YOUR THE VOICE!!
Blown away. That's all I have. I'm not even a fan of Ren. Incredible work
PLEASE CONCERT!!! WILL FLY TO LONDON OR UK TO SEE YOU LIVE!
This is a MASTERPIECE!!
Мощно , ахуенно 🎉
Pure brilliance. ☀️
Very fucking nice.
Rest in peace Ren ;(
Bro bro never disappoints
this is an absolute bop, you are talented man
This video is a game-changer. I mean, ALL of Ren’s work is a game-changer. It so stunningly raises the bar for me. Holy cow!
Simply elegant!
Fantastic mate. Riches turns to rubble when perspective evolves. JUST EPIC.
This is so good end thought-provoking but...anyone else think Ren looks like Damon Salvatora (Ian Somerhalder)?
Silence has never sounded greater. Sadly, Sick Boi out now.
Thank you for your storytelling and your music. Please stay true to yourself. And thank you for Grieg.
if someone said this was there favourite song id bloke them
This song and production are next level! Ren, you are truly pushing the boundaries of music (and music videos!) I applaud everyone involved in the making of this.
What a fucking masterpiece like for reals fucking masterpiece ❤
heavy. very heavy. well done.
That was beautifully horrifying, and horrifyingly beautiful.
Brilliantly done :) cheers!
Your voice and unique  artistical presentation  is so important! Thank you for your commitment Ren. You have become one of my favorite artist.
He is the master of silence. Those breaks . You can hear yourself breathe waiting for whats coming next.
Ik vind Ren krankzinnig goed
This is pure art
Mr. Shelby got bars
The muwic video really gives this aong another layer, yall ahould start making musicals
I saw it 3 time back to back , omg truly art masterpiece , definitely i get ticket and go to his concert , BTW i'm from IRAN (jimmy shell iran lol)
you go out of Rens music feeling like you have experienced someone elses lifetime within a few minutes, truly amazing
At 54 years old I've bought my first rap/hip hop album!! I've listened to all your back catalogue and your talent is incredible. So glad you put Genesis on this album it's one of my favourites!! But Seven Sins is an amazing track and needs its own video!!
Genius!!!!
Absolutely breathtaking.
THE WORLD HAS MOVED ON >>> WE THE PEOPLE   Q
Mint. Everytime
Fantasic best video yet. Love to work with you some day... but now I see you don't even need my help. Best I can do right now is a low effort React video.
Hell yeah
You have inspired this poor and " disabled" old lady to keep on keepin on in my truth and keeping on telling my three amazingly smart and capable kids that the truth is the first rule of life and pay attention and violence is never the answer as a solution
دي اول اغنيه ليا عايز اعرف اذا كان حلوه ولا وحشه  https://youtu.be/VlQ0epiPNgI?si=PEXNH2hFVzqTYRVg
BEAST VID
This is truly a lyrical masterpiece
Story telling at its roots and finest. You are amazing. A modern day bard.
As if the song & video weren't enough.... the documentary by Wolf gave an entirely new appreciation for the art y'all put out while working with such a small crew.  Incredible vision and work ethic. Ren deserves every bit of success he achieves. 👏🏽 👏🏽
This 💪👀
I'm just another algorithm comment
Please make a visual for Seven sins. 🙏 Beautiful album Ren. Glad you put genesis and a couple other classics 🫂
wow. just wow.
Dude, the Cinematography is again next level........ Single take clips are breaking every rule in the book, and you are knocking it out of the park...... A perfect complement to another awesome song.... Cheers mate......\m/...
This is my new favorite from Ren!!! Keep up the hard yet amazing work young man!!!
wooowww
Absolute Masterpiece, like the other two parts
i've got the shakes
I had never heard of REN. I am ashamed. This. Is. Art.
Stunning piece of art
I have watched this video more than a healthy amount 😂 I think it was a happy coincidence but the part where he spins the globe.. it stops as he picks up the phone as if his dad dying stops his world. Masterpiece all around.
you sold your soul boy...
Damn
Damn...I didn't know Tommy Shelby could sing and rap ....🙄
Just Amazing keep doing this Artistic Style. Everything fits so well together! Great Job to the whole Team. Amazing Work
succes for you
REN YOU FUCKING EXISTENTIALIST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I hate you I love you
Everytime Ren Uploads, my friends will get notified, wether they like it or not.
You look like "Cillian Murphy". I was confused whether he's you or you is he :)
Awesome
W
algoriddim stylee
Awsome piece of art, since when does Tommy Shelby sing/rap?
Loud.
I’m not sure if there is a word that exists for this kind of Art.  Forget flowers, you deserve Gardens
I'm pretty sure this is way more than a music video..
also leaving a comment for the algorithm. Thanks for the goose bumps
ren is so talented. if you gave him an instrument he could master it in a day
Why haven’t we already seen him in a Guy Richie’s movie?!
Can someone  put subtitles for my friend Adriyan from USA his brother is a dentist ?
I love stories you tell!
REN, thank you so much! This is an absolute masterpiece! Love your work! From Russia with love!
Everything you make is a masterpiece
Thank you REN!! your music is so awesome I'm 4 days late but damn you are a Legend Thank you again for your awesome music mate!
Another brilliant song taking us on an emotional journey that you can’t help but get pulled into. I don’t think I’ve watched one of these videos without crying, no matter how many times I’ve seen it. I wish more people would watch these and take their messages to heart.
masterpiece
No hay otro artista capaz de movilizarme TANTO
Genius
Give him 5 months and he'll be in a BMTH song calling it
Luigi taught me capitalism, now Bag man is teaching me everything else.
And another wonderful masterpiece ❤
I wonder if it would make sense that at the end the gun jammed and he survived. Could be taken as his penance or second chance, could go many ways.
That is not 9 minutes!!!, feels like 3 minutes!, what a song, still doing the best video.
nice
Man.. U did it again. Thats a masterpiece.
This is just unreal. I love it.
This is beautiful. I've been listening to this for 5 hours
More more give me more of this ;) Thank you for being real with us
Wow, again great Lyrics!
This is an incredible video, storytelling on point. What a performance
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Another great hit hot damn
Cuando la música se convierte en arte , sublime. Ren mi nuevo descubrimiento, quizás despierte en mi de nuevo mi vena artistica. Gracias
Fuck me that Tommy Shelby
damn, didnt know he made a part 3
THIS! This made me cry. I have never seen something more relevant and meaningful in my life. This perfectly illustrates the world and it's largest issue that plagues the mind of any critical thinker in modern western society. The masterful artwork aside, THIS is real. And it's so simple. The problem is simply greed and lack of willful foresight. And the solution much more simple. FIX EDUCATION. From there we could collectively build a better world with systems in place that prioritizes our progress as a species and not the short term profit. I know that I am a fan of Ren and that makes this a little bias. However, in the most un-bias way possible, THIS video is the most important video in the modern era that everyone needs to see. Everyone needs to fully comprehend this masterpiece and it's message. This is our reality and it can only lead to one outcome for us. It doesn't have to be this way.  I am ready to make a difference. And thanks to you Ren, I know I am not alone.
Here again, listening to the Sound of violins and the bass.. It is so beautfiful how you put this together.. I get goosebumbs allover and it feels like someone is lifting up my soul. It is incredibly beautfiful. Your voice in this is filling it all up with even more energy. So sad it had to stop. ❤  I guess i got a dopamin-ren-fusion.
Tommy shelby
Sweet❤
So depressing, but, just the right amount of hope buried right in the middle. Poetry.
I think this might just be one of the best releases of the last years and by far the best text i've heard in a very long time. Truth told. The video is awesome as well, thank you Ren.
.......not baaaad😉
I love that the violin plays the tune that you hum in part 1 and 2!
🔥 📛 👩‍🚒
juest comment for better reach
a genius doing genius stuff🔥🔥
Please do the American theatre tour
😍😍
I didn't think you could do better than 'Hey Ren', but I think you just did.
absolute HEAT
Awesome video, great message.
More than music....more than a story, more than a lesson.... something beyond it all
The more I listen to it the better it gets ❤
this goated
So many layers not only to the song/lyrics, but to the video itself. As always, a cinematic experience to go along with a deep and thought provoking song. I love the way  you push boundaries as an artist!
Please make more content I really enjoy it
Guys, write more comments, it helps the algorithm!!
Wow!  Another song/video by Ren that sucked me in, leaving me wanting more.  I love these one-shot take videos (whether it is, or isn't).  I guess I'm doing this Quentin Tarantino-style, as I haven't seen the part 1, or 2 of this.  I'll now watch part 1, then 2.  Great stuff!!!
Master class by Ren love ya bro
Algorithm has chosen us!!!
Phenomenal work REN. Masterpiece of linguistics, rhythm and story telling.
Do you know life flashes before your eyes
hello
With all the craziness in the world right now, im really appreciating Ren sharing his light, his truth with the world. 💚
I have never made a comment and I don't know what else to say except...   Thank you, Ren
Lost peaky blinders brother?
WoW, this is incredibly told, and a lesson that all should hold dear.  As money is not everything. But it leads us into fear, connect with your people and do it for your soul, and try and make those changes before you're grey and old. ✌️💚✨️
eyo this is so deep and catchy Welldone Ren
😘😘😘😘​MAKE SURE IF YOU BOUGHT THE DIGITIAL  SICK BOI ALBUM THAT YOU GET IT DOWNLOADED BY THURSDAY.... BUYING THE ALBUM DOESN'T COUNT FOR THE UK CHART UNTIL YOU DOWNLOAD IT.😘😘😘😘  ********SPREAD THE WORD*******
🔥🔥💯
Fuckin' 🔥man getting you and @Profgampo together on a track would be gold ✊
Yet another epic journey with the lyrics and masterly crafted video!
Peaky Blinders Story would go CRAZY
Awesome. I'm an old bastard and I love it
You are an artist.
For me, it has always been theater, able to affect me to this level, especially mono spectacles. Chapeau, Ren!
🔥 story
🔥 story
Hi Ren, I've been reflecting on the current state of the music industry and discussing it with some folks, especially in the context of your latest production. The sad reality is that nowadays, people with superficial understanding or even no real grasp of music are dictating the trends. They decide what's "in" and what's not, often sidelining the true essence of music in favor of showy visuals and repetitive lyrics.  But amidst this noise, you emerge as a beacon of genuine artistry and talent. Your recent work is a testament to the fact that true talent doesn't need exorbitant budgets to resonate and leave an impact. It brought to mind the depth and emotionality of "Freckled Angels". It's evident that all the physical and psychological challenges you've faced have shaped you, perhaps even driving you to create the profound music you do now. Like freckled angels who have seen the depths of life, you've risen, stronger and more capable, touching countless souls with your art.  You're not only showcasing your impeccable skills but also setting an example and paving a path for many budding artists. It's an inspiration, a reminder that genuine passion and dedication can indeed defy the norms set by those who might not truly "get" music.  Huge congratulations on this masterpiece, and thank you for reminding us all what real music feels like in an era often clouded by shallow trends. And don't forget to have fun. Not every piece has to be like this one 🙂
I have never had a more visceral reaction to a song in my entire 34 years on this planet. This is an absolute masterpiece. Having dealt with war, suicide, and sitting on the sidelines of the evolution of greed over the last few decades this put it better than anything or anyone ever has. Cheers Ren. Thank you.
And another one dude!!! Love it!
Have lost count on how many times I’ve watched this! Can’t get enough of this masterpiece!!!!!!!! 🎉
Em enjoying
Amazing!❤
This is awesome, Ren doesn’t miss, the message is deep and meaningful and resonates with so many I’m sure. The only bit I didn’t like was the huge gap of silence after “my solution” while he’s folding his jacket but that’s just because I want to her Ren every second of every song lol
Subbed and Like 🔥
Incredible
uraaaaaaa
damn u good
Yeh are fucking next level Ren. Reality 'slap' check.

ok we get it Ren....You're life is screwed up....The drama is getting old
when you a so used living on a shadow of someone and that someone disappear and you don't know what to do with the light
This is definitely another feather in his cap. Bravo!
this is not a song, it's poetry with all its beauty and none of its boredom
absolute masterpiece
Absolutely beautiful. Well done.
Another masterpiece can’t stop watching it it’s something I’ve never seen before it’s like being at the Opera cinema such a talent. and with everything you’re going through bless ren 🙏🏾🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇬🇧
I just finished it. This needs to be trending.
Это великолепно 🎉
You are an inspiration... You give me a small bit of hope for the younger generations. They need to take inspiration from you...
So money game now like lord of the rings series but musical then
Incredible story, thank you.
holy shit this is amazing
No way part 3 came put a few days before I was just looking to relisten to part 2.   It is fate.
POWERFUL!
Ren is a great showman, and, I am not gonna lie, he looks like Matty Healy a bit.
This is something else, so uniq and awesome!!👏👏
Make the movie, I’ll watch it 🤘😎🤘💵💸
Brilliant, an absolutely brilliant song. Beautiful❤️‍🔥
Oop, a bit late?
Theatrical artists 🎨 painting the world, love's it 💛
this is not finnish yet is it Ren so many stories of the monies games in life's we have to play. Peace out big up ya self.
yes
очень круто и эмоционально! Нет слов!
Ren is a true artist with a genius mind.
Algorithm
fucking wow
Amazing storytelling everytime ❤️  things seem fictional, but they're more than realistic situations right about now
trash
Thank you...thank you...thank you !!!
damn thats f#cking great
Motherfucker !! I'm from thailand fan I love u mann
a movie in a video
Unreal
This needs more attention then it got
This was just amazing ❤
Brilliant…we all live the same world, just a different chaos.
These one-take videos have completely ruined music videos as a whole for me. I adore this style.
Darn I love all this parts
His brilliance is unparalleled  Helping with the algorithm
Nobody should be this gifted it seems unfair!.
when shelby forgot that he is G
the strings... the STRINGS.  *sigh*
Magic and profound
Just a thought.. Can you imagine what Ren could do with an unlimted budget?
Nicely done!
This is Art right here.
Awesome <3
This guy is a fuckin genius!!!
I didn't know Thomas Shelby could spit like that
Fuckin art
I love that this song came out at the same time as "The fall of the house of usher", there is a speech in one of the later episodes that bring the same message as this song and money game part 2, if you dont wanna watch the show you can search up "house of usher lemon speech".
Bravo! Magnificentísimo! 🦢🌹🦢🌹🦢🌹
Wow what an artist.
When the strings start playing the hook from money game 1 & 2....😢
Simply stunning piece of work. Can't express how good this is.. I've spent nearly 50 years as an artist, never come anywhere close to this. Thanks Ren.
Is this about Hunter Biden?
Lovvveee it so amazing how you tell stories trough music and also make it visual. It’s just beautiful.
Brilliant
Amazing as always Ren love it your talents are amazing
Absolutely master piece. Every song is so fkn good. This one u can actually call ARTIST. Fresh breath of air
This is not a music. This is a STATEMENT!
(:
BIG-UP FROM NY,NY!!
"Stop the music. This is not entertainment." Fuuuu'!!! Chills. 💖
Woah
👏 👏
I've been here for around 12 months,  always knowing where Ren was going but in my heart thinking it would be the same old story of talent witithout glory. I was stupid when I look back. This kind of talent just doesn't go unrecognised. Pure passion such as this squeezes it's way through. Through hard work and pure persistance and the need for truth.
Every man needs to hear this if raising a son
He’s done it again……!!!  How??
hehe money talk xd
Ren is something else. Calling this music doesn't even cover what this is. This is truth. This is art, true art. Just wow.
Damn ! I'm not a rap person.. but your poetry and visual language are something else ! What an artist ! 🤜🤛
Damn.
@Ren, my sons are 8 and 9 and I let them watch Money Game 3 because of how important I think the message is. As a fellow human being, thank you for what you do.
This is dope
Wow mind blown ❤
Day 5 - never gunna give this up, never gunna let it down.
I kept putting off watching this because I knew I'd become obsessed. Now I'm stunned at how you summarized my views on money
Wow!! Only just discovered Ren!! Amazing!!
You did it again!
This man is a musical genius. Never misses.
You're right, this is not entertainment. This is art, in its purest form.
this is sick
This man is a genius
thank you ren for all that you are doing just considerer me one of the wise i don't have much but i'm fighting for the same cause keep doing what ur doing
Ren is so talented,  he even solved a Rubic's cube in few seconds !!! 😊
It’s simple you can’t be human 😆 your amazing mate and a genius! 🥰 legend
This song has been stuck in my head for days!
Hope your message continues to spread far and wide mate, and most of all, I truly I hope you live it too. You're probably about to be catapulted into the worst bits of it at this point.
Immediately liked it cause I knew this was gonna be fire!
I love you
Lovely stuff
Hi everyone. We need a big push to get this album to number one! It's only a few hundred copies behind Rick Ashley, I'm sure we can do this. I'm buying another album to help out.  Ren so deserves this.  Don't forget if you have already bought or are about to buy a digital download , you have to STILL  physically download  the copy from your email to your computer else it WILL NOT count towards the charts.
Time and time again he rattles these out! Superb!
So incredible in every aspect
Holy shit
If a song can ever change the world, I hope it’s a Ren song.
this is too good to be 1.3 mil
why Thomas Shelby here 💀
No one creates art in the way Ren does. Pure talent with so much emotion.
Please tell me u are doing a video for seven sins too🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻❤
yo sick bro
nois meit
Wow
Wow!
Holy **** wow. This left me speechless.  wow
Brilliant…
This is unbelieveable. Independent. And doing this. ❤
Insane 😊
Sick
This is now the Ren video I have watched the most times and its been out less than a week.
I absolutely love the music in this song. It's so catchy and well-arranged.
Amazing, so much work, I'm stunned and riveted
wow.. just wow
What more can we say about this man  absolutely brilliant, this is what we need to hear..... truth
Masterpiece indeed. The choreography, the music, the cinematography is all incredible. And Ren's performance is absolutely unreal. Thank you all for making this. I am awed and delighted with what you have created.
Not often do I get shivers from a song, not often do I listen to 9 minute long songs, never do I do it on repeat.  But this song, this message to us all, is above everything I've heard before. The sheer soul and blood put into this eyeopener are tremendous
Absolute AMAZING🥊🥊
🙏Thankyou⚕️♾️⭕️♾️⚕️🙌✨✨✨
Luigi pointed me to this video
💙💙💙
How good is Great.
You know what?... I changed my mind about HipHop...
Again and again, the lyrics and the music keeps blowing me away.
Peaky blinders?
Wow! Incredible!
at leat talkin some sense to the kidos
Wow
1.3m views in 4 days. Incredible 👏👏👏 🎉🎉🎉
Crazy. Absolut crazy cant say more than that. I love it and comment for algorithm.
Masterpiece
Another masterpiece of melding storytelling, music, melody, and a bit of magic.
Money is...all of that..
Ren for anti-president !! (C) Phreddy.   Just awesome
Pure Music Art in its truest form.. Amazing
algo work
👏
Our Thomas Shelby is Back with a Bang! Ren is ten outta Ten!!
1.4m views in 4 days, easily his fastest million on a tune, its normally around 8/9 days
Now the burning question of the day…. Where is Jimmy’s mom??? 🤷‍♀️😋😘
Oh _ my _ God _ Ren..... I am in awe.... seriously. This is pure ART. Genius. Never, and I am absolutely serious about this, have I EVER seen a bigger masterpiece of a music video concept.  Congrats, and wonderful, absolutely fabulous, to meet you!   Thanks, man!  Your possibly biggest fan, and according to her daughters, the most fabulous Mom (and right now highly inspired genius artist)  SSB aka Lana
Didn't know Thomas Shelby could rap, I'll be honest, but damn he spittin' flames.
OMG this is beyond genius, beautiful simple beautiful 😍
Synchronicity  It is a confluence of event that led us here. In counter part, we've been the observer long enough to gather all the energies and information to now move in to the next phase. The realization of partnership between ourselves, is now solid and certain. This superpower is now deployed and will reach everyone.  We love you.  Peace out ✌ MIA FAMILIA   - RoXxY LOVE P.L.U.R.
I truly have no words to explain how I feel about these songs but I can say that you are what everyone needs to hear. I am glad you are here with us today to spread this message. YOU are what this world needs in this desprete time we are in. I thank you for what you put out into this world we live in you are truly one of a kind.
Violinist in the back on the left is like "wait, why am I getting wet ?"
Go Ren,, you absolutely deserve every success, you have earned it. Stay grounded and beware of poisonous leeches ,yes men and false new friends  .Don't bite the apple.
I don't have any fancy words and I can't even express my feelings properly but I wanted to still try because I think Ren deserves all of the recognition, love and support in the world. Not only is this a musical but also a visual/cinematographic masterpiece! I think I will be forever in awe of how Ren manages to express all of these complex emotions, psychological states, social concepts, moral struggles all the while he puts it in a poetic way. But more importantly, it's all presented in a raw and unfiltered way - with all the ugly, all the horrible, heartbreaking and devastating. I think most of us have lost this ability - to say what we mean in the most genuine and truthful way there is. Thank you for making such beautiful music, Ren! And for sharing it with us <3
Petition to remove dislike button for this video 👇
Npr teaser led me to watch. What a trip.
❤❤❤
THAT'S CARZYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
wow. just wow.
This is the first video on YouTube I've pressed the like button and commented on in 5 years
Discovered Ren from "Chalk Outlines" and "MGP2", thrilled to be here for MGP3, though no cap, I hope we don't need a MGP4 and that mfers learn a thing or two from these nursery rhymes, like good school kids, line by line 🔥
DUDE THIS IS EPICCC!!!  i could TOTALLY ANIMATE THIS (once i improve my animation)
Me mié
Концепция похожа на Childish Gambino
I never know what to expect but this beat any kind of expectations I had.. masterpiece ❤❤
You could make a film out of this and I'd watch the hell out of it. The story you manage to tell in 10 minutes is doubly as important and near damn as hard hitting as anything the media conglomerates will sell - because it's the truth. The most incredible work as always, Ren, what a wonderful rollercoaster of emotion - and I'm all here for it. You're going places, farther then you'll know, and I truly think you'll influence the world someday. :) <3
Ren, I'm a Psychiatric nurse who works with seriously mentally ill kids, our music therapist also works with medically ill children. I shared your music with her. She struggles with Lupus. She loved your music, she is going to tell your story and share your music. We both feel your music can help our kids❤There is nobody like you. You are a genius.
Fvcking wow! Just wow!
Wow amazing
MOM I AM HERE. and this song probably is my favorite of this series 🤑🤑🤑
wow ...
Hi ren
My goodness 👏🏻 👏🏻 👏🏻
That was one of the greatest stories that were ever told! Needs to be made into a 2 hour movie! Haha loved it dude
So awesome
Why’s this my story and we’re 22
One shot. One vision. One masterwork.
Stunning !!
Looks like YouTube promoted this video with afterparty. Ironic adequately.
These videos always give me a new perspective to think of time to time. Awesome video man
You my friend are one hell of a story teller. Boy oh boy what a talent. RESPECT RESPECT RESPECT.
Holy shit Ren blows my mind every single time.
You should talk with 21 savage for a collabo nice music
Oh hell yeah! I never knew there was gonna be a part 3! 🔥
No.
Dang! Awesome!
I'm living for the anti capitalistic message!
This is so good!!!!!!!!!!
Nice. fresh. Art. Freedom. human.
This is what Mozart was like to the people back then. This is 1000IQ music. This is more than just a song, a music video, a poem, a statement. It’s diamond.
Netflix, amazon Prime take note.  This is an audition with Ren and his team showing what they can deliver - shear brilliance a movie in 9 minutes.
Strange times we're living in panic and Hysteria
REN, you truly are a gem and I’m thankful to have found your music! I get excited every time I see a release!
This supposed to be an actual song??
Ok Hi Ren was enjoyable.  I like your music, appreciate your virtuosity but they starting to sound the same, communicating nothing but insanity, playing with the "4th wall", and trying to outdo yourself.  Find the center, first,  then move back out from there. You're starting it all on the fringe and it's easy to say you want that but I don't think anybody wants that... they just don't want to be alone so they'll settle for less to get it.  Best wishes.
Art with meaning again. Thank you 🙏
Few who need to see this will ever see this. (Many make this about them, people need to see this.)
Leaving a comment for the algorithm
pretty cool ngl
Love it.

I can't wait until the day the people bring an end to this toxic money game.
This is a "Bohemian Rhapsody" for the modern age, a true classic masterpiece, I've not been impressed by any artist since The Stone Roses.   The musical landscape has been missing true talent, at least we don't need to wait any longer, welcome "Ren" your time has come 🤗💞😘

what a masterpiece
something to think about if one asks me
Genius
The fact that this is 9 minutes long is crazy. You get so drawn in that you don't even notice that you're listening to the song that is three times longer than the average song.
Extremely fine performance, Mr. Shelby!
FENOMENAL!!!
Absolutely beautiful. Wonderfully articulated and powerful message, I'm really pleased to see how well it is being received by so many people too! We all know the truth in our hearts but get blinded by the game, art like this helps us realize what we already know. Artists like you are an essential part of our society. I sincerely thank you for all your hard work and commitment to what you do, you're incredibly talented and all your practice, blood, sweat, and tears that were shed alone behind closed doors, all your efforts are blatantly obvious in your work. I can feel the pain you've endured and the passion you've clung to for so many years. Incredible piece of work, as is all of your stuff! Peace and love my friend!
Why am I just now finding out about Ren!
I am 40 years old. Huge fan of Ren. My 5 year old son sings some of his songs and my Dad loves these story telling "movies".  Not only is this man not in a specific genre he's also intergenerational. Skys the limit my friend.
Im sure the ai was un intended, looking like a blinder, sure this mistake unintended, forgive me if my interpration requires degrading. your a good lad son i met your manns saying how great u r.
It would be amazing to see you perform in Australia, I don't care where, I would fly to see you perform!
❤😸
Thank you for this awesomeness
Wow that was incredible!! Keep it up man…..everything you put out is solid!!
Couldn’t have asked for a better birthday gift
Nice work everyone. Excellent job all the way around. Was this done in one shot? I'll have to watch again and see if there is a cut when the camera goes behind the wheelchair. I'm not sure people realize how difficult it is to shoot something like this in one shot. Nice work.
The Real Peaky Blinder.   This was a masterpiece , brilliant work.
Pure genius.
Now go listen to 1&2 it is all a masterpiece
great video and all but your finger was on the trigger for the entire time. Even if your suicidal maybe don't wave around a  loaded gun everywhere
Man, you are so fuckin talented.
incredible work 🏴‍☠🏴‍☠🏴‍☠
Hi Ren.
Excuse my French, but this was fucking amazing to watch!!
That was awsome!
I really do love these songs, accoustic, meets rap with a strong message. And I do prefer them over the last few songs that have come out. Either way I'm a fan for life.
luigi really introduced me to some very important financial educational materials
So, Shelby sings
When Thomas Shelby decides to be a musician
master monster very crazy ♪♫
if you manipulate the data the lie will sell itself
was the spin at the start a hidden cut? or is this a real oner (one unbroken shot)?
Well done! Love the unique talent that Ren is
Masterpiece!
Best song and video of the century in my opinion
A whole new world REN
:D
Can't agree more with Masterpiece comment. “It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.”
Leaving my comment since Knox told me to: Ren looks great in a suit or a hospital gown!
💧
Well played
Jimmy followed the code inside the land of the free put his hand in the cookie jar and took more than he need...  bro ur a legend
✊🕶️🌹
❤❤❤
Too long for me, didn't watch till the end.
Brilliant!
It is always pleasure to see your work. Stay well.
What is the solution you are promoting though? There are a couple, but what is yours? hope youll have a part 4 with it..
His style of music is an enquired taste, and I can tell the real genuine genius mind behind it, and honestly I am beginning to really appreciate it, and enquire it more!
Beautiful and Genius !
❤❤❤❤❤
Amazing camera work and the start makes me think of alice in wonderland
Is this modern Shakespeare?
Bro i dont even know what to say. I just spent the last 3 hours getting my mind blown. Each song is so fucking amazing .  Illest of our time!
Genius!
I love the storytelling with this piece. Really strong set, costumes, and cinematography! The suspense was tangible when the gun came into the scene.
Holy shit, this is POWERFUL. U weren’t kidding when u said it was ur most ambitious video yet.
Fucking ridiculous. I like a lot of videos but comment on none. This one needed it because I know of the algorithm fuckeries that do be afoot. I've heard Ren's #1 in New Zealand and close in Australia. Surely gonna make wakes back home here and in the US.  Come on sonny Jim!!!!!
I definitely liked part 2 more then part 3. I'm not really a poem kind of guy and this was more toward poem then song. I wasn't that much into it. But hey. to each their own.
It’s heavy stuff, Ren. I liked the storytelling bit of this Jimmy from age one through 50 or whatever. You rhymes are interesting and not overplayed. You’ve got real talent. I suppose it’s hard for the masses to understand this complexity in music. It’s hard to digest for the average person. I admire your intelligence. Keep your demons at bay, mate
just hinting for the algo.. such a masterpiece .. we need more like thisss
after watching the video a few times and reactions. i just noticed you can hear his footsteps every now and then.
So deep and so good. Incredible artistry yet again.
🔥❤️👏
DAMNN
Best message ever. I bloody love you Ren. I have a lot of medical issues and reasons I can proper relate to you. I share your opinions on quite a numerous amount of subjects. Please can money game part 4 or 5 have something about geoenginering. I was far to early when I used it as my dissertation the research all came out 2 years after my graduation.....  you capture so many hearts and minds. You are to me the voice of the people. Fuck the system. Keep shining bright you crazy diamond 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤
🫡👑🙏
Absoulte genius
Ayo, always a pleasure!
The end of this always makes me have this feeling in my stomach no matter how many times I watch this 😣
Litteraly Genius this dude ❤
Anyone else think Ren looks like Sharkface from Red vs Blue??
Tommy shelby is a dope as artist
Damn Ren!
Nice👍🏼
Too bad this chat is gone.  It was cool chatting with you about 'All Things Ren.'  Maybe you could start one up, Ren?  Love to you and all. ❤❤
Beautiful! Brought tears to my eyes as I listened entranced!   Thank you!
I did like the little cut at the start in front of the mirror to fix his hair 😂👍
And how can we stop to care too much about moneyy?????
@renmakesmusic #triggerwarning  {Goes without saying, I suppose. Perhaps I should have read the liner notes beforehand?} Sufficed it to admit, in this moment, once I heard the click of the slide, I instantly winced & had to turn away. Fuksticks! FukMe! & Fukery! TBH, I hadn't any prior knowledge that I had an issue with this specifically until now. Always attempting to reframe the present and see the upside in Life, there's something new I personally learned about myself that I shall confess I'm grateful for experiencing. #Appreciation #Admiration #Adoration 🙏🏻 @erinxxii
@linmanuelmiranda
I have to say that this is one of the best videos music that I have seen in the last decade. the transitions are phenomenal. The only thing I recommend is to put a disclaimer about the gun and the suicidal thoughts could be younger people interpreting this in the wrong way. But I love it this is one of your master pieces.
I’m so grateful to be here before you blow up Ren, your music means so much to me and the rest of the world deserves to hear it. I’m going to share  it now.
.
algorithm boosting comment :)
Why after party Money Game  3 is only for YouTube premium??????😮
Terrible trigger discipline, Jimmy.  Ren you were great as you always are 🙃😄 🐐
Wow!! I mean… I’m at a loss for words. I’ll be honest. I’ve been in a bad spot for almost 2 years now, trying to piece together my own dysfunctional world, raging war with my self, loosing ground as soon as I gain a just a sliver of hope to keep going.  I know it might sound ridiculous but… the new album, songs like this gives me hope that I’m not alone in this world. Hope when I thought all was lost. Thank you Ren. For giving a voice to those who feel hopeless.
Another Masterpiece!
You my friend, are so CAPTIVATING! Your story telling and clever use of pauses and words are absolutely amazing bro. You should be proud of yourself man. your talent and commitment to your craft should be recognised by all :)
A winning formula? Hi Ren was epic. Go sideways now for a while, then forward.
This is actually so good
when you let others peoples life takes over you little man
Commenting to push the engagement
Ren is one of the greats!
this guys a drip
Truly a genius
You've done it again mate, tears rolling down my face!  Peace. X

Been a while since music held power to account. Bravo kid. Superb.
Genius!
This is not at all what i had expected when clicking on this in my recommended, but wow it did not dissapoint!!! 🔥
Man... this is as good as it can ever be.
Love this story telling. And awesome album
This is our world.  We all wanted to be reach.  Me2
❤
Don't know what to say. Really good
Who else wants MONEY GAME PART 4!
Hi Ren. Add me g.
Art in perfection. Never seen something like that before! ❤
Wow, love it… so intense with headphones and no distractions watching this gem.
this is art
Man this kid blows my mind he pure class. Keep up the great work from geordie... peace
Unbelievable
Ren is genius.
Discovered you randomly few days ago. I have already listened to most of your songs many times and to be fair I think that you are exacly what I imagine as an artist. Pure talent and hard work, great poetry skills, characteristic voice, uniqe look and history as well. I absolutely love it, keep it up and one day u will be known as "The Goat of Music"
Here's the sad truth.: there's always another Jimmie to take the first's place. That's why this game never ends, only gets worse for the rest... until the game can't sustain itself.
awesome possum video my fella cant wait for money game 4 my legs are shaking much love your fellow uk citizen
Trigger discipline, my guy 🤦
Srsly this was sick
Plain genius.
thanks for the amazing concept video series - and thanks for the premium afterparty
This felt so real that I was concerned about gun safety at the end. Another amazing work by ren
Amazing piano and original Ren style, he proved with his talent that you can actually continue to be yourself, without compromising path with labels, to be independent and burn the bridges. You have made a very big mark on the way music and video should be made. Love you Ren, continue to be yourself, the most honest and personal artist.
👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
well... i haven't been here for a while. 1,11 Mio Subs. I knew it :o) I am happy for you. There is nothing so beautiful to me, like the sounds of violines and bass ..and combined with poetry, it is all.
Hey Ren, i tried to buy youre album, but most stores are creditcard only, and i (and most in the Netherlands) dont have a creditcard, is there a way i can buy a download with ideal?
Broooooooo ur freaking Killer !!! From France !!! Ur killer !!!
No other words but a masterpiece.True Arists always been able to fully to articulate the zeitgeist. Kudos.
Amazing stuff ✌️
God I wasn’t expecting it to be this cinematic, but then again I wasn’t expecting a part 3
Ren what else can one say? You have the applause, you have the praise and you now have the recognition you so deserve. But do you realize all this attention and all of your RENegades are  here for you!! 🎉🎉Thank you for allowing us to share in this magical moment with the man who put us all together
Incredible piece of art brother!!!
Everyone needs to see this
The youtube timekeeping is dreadful. No way that was over 9 minutes.  That was just amazing.
Scrumptious song
🍋 🍋 🍋 🍋 🍋 🍋 🍋
For everyone who pre ordered the digital download, don't forget to download it!  Otherwise it doesn't count towards the charts!   ❤🙂❤🙂❤🙂❤
That did not feel like +9 minutes!
What a beautiful RENdition ❤️
Incredible
Boy did I miss our favourite money game
bro wtf, I just sat here for like 5 min after the Video ended thinking about what a masterpiece this was and I came to the conclusion that this is one of the most brilliant things I have seen in the music industry. I just have mad respect for you and your team.
This is a MASTERPIECE!!
Masterpiece . Respect 🫡 from Florida!
You are so talented Ren, I only started watching your stories/lyrics/compositions recently and I can’t stop listening to reactions and being surprised at your talent once again. I respect you so much, you have such a bright future teaching us your ways and insights. So much love!!!!
Awesome as usual!
Anyone else think Ren should make a full on stage musical?
Sensational sir
Thomas Shelby made a song
❤
This is one of the greatest pieces of art that I've had the pleasure of being alive to witness.   It's too bad the world is burning right now.
This is a masterpiece, you should get an oscar
Ren is dope!!
Protect these two men (Sam + Ren)
Fucking incredible 🔥🔥

Wow Ren, just fucking Wow!
I love money game
Awesome 💚💚💚 WE L♻️💚E REN, now and zen!!!❤❤💚❤️❤️
Fantastic! The love of money is the root of all evil. Somebody important said that once. When I say it, I get called a socialist. A million  times over, rather be a socialist than a capitalist.
❤❤❤
I'm speechless. You are such an insane artist.
Ren will write the music for the next James Bond film.
9:19 just like "hi ren"
I'll be a billionaire if he keeps making these
This peice is a chiller bro, goosebumps....
nice
kudos to the crew. . looked like a two shot film
This is straight up art
❤
finally, holy shit he did it
Dopeeee!!!
Comment to push this masterpiece <3
How incredible Ren. Your truth is such beautiful power ❤
Every word leaves me hanging for the next. Completely blown away by the truth that hits you like a hammer when watching this. This hits home in a big way for me as it basically tells the story of my cousin to a T, even the 45 cal at 45 years old. ❤ your storytelling  and message.
The best ever, excellent performance by REN!

Crazy.
so unorthodox and originally epic its hard not to like   from the effort to the awesome result was quite a journey
Ron i tak nie zrozumiesz komentarza,ale piszesz w chuj dobre tekst. Młody ale z pojęciem, dobrą robotę synek robisz

My Story starts with Hi Ren and ends  with Ren. Thank you so much for your music. It helps alot. Be care of you
A PART 3 HOLY SHIT
Genius!!!
When you see the picture he paints, it's a magical whirlwind of the money game.
Yo, this is amazing ❤
Kudos to another one ☝️
I believe Ren has and is doing something truly amazing.  I cannot think of anyone who is more deserving of having his or her music appreciated by the world.  With the money game he gave us a small example of how collectively we can make a change. Let’s use this collective approach to ensure that the world is impacted! I encourage each and every person that has liked..appreciated…been inspired by or gone down that Ren Rabbit hole to push his album every single moment you can.  COPY AND PASTE LINKS TO HIS ALBUM AND HIS STORY EVERYWHERE UNTIL ITS SATURATED.  LETS SHOW THE WORLD WHAT WE CAN DO IN SUPPORT OF REN.  COLLECTIVELY!
the Money Game series is a beautiful explanation of the slow decline of capitalism, and the need for people to rise up against corruption that it causes.
Super ! En plus tu explose le compteur en quelques jours ! C'est mérité. Pour money game, Y'a un peu trop de ruptures avec les parties les plus mélodiques qui sont un peu courte mais elles sont magnifiques !😊 . Au final ça reste Nickel 👍✌️ Merci c'est toujours un plaisir d'écouter ce que tu fais !! 🎉🎉🎉👊
And I thought they were done making Peaky Blinders episodes.
Genuinely the best music video I've ever seen
This is spectacular 🙌 thanks Ren
holy shit
💣💣
Heavily impressed and inspired. Every time. Bravo Ren. Are you experiencing post partum symptoms after so much work and build up? Must be quite crazy to be you right now. Hope you can rest and take care to recharge mate. You've been so generous with us and constantly working while in treatment. We love you.
genius as always
❤❤
25th time listening and watching... Just Amazing, truly a gift to those willing to accept. THANK YOU, Sam and Ren ❤❤❤❤❤

This is amazing
you are the art itself
[Piano and yodelling intro]  [Verse 1] Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy 1 years old and his first words were "Mine, mine, gimme!" 2 years old he was walking, 3 years old walking quickly 4 years old he was running 'round the pavements of his city 5 years old and his daddy told him "Listen here, son You gotta learn to be a man, a man, he works for what he wants" 6 years old and he’s reading, writing, top of the bunch And when he's 7, his progression made him student number 1 8 years old and he’s praised for unusual grades 9, his parents pay for private school to nurturе the flame 10, 11, 12, 13, he ascеnds and ascends His daddy tells him "Son, money is the means to all ends" 14, solving complex mathematic equations At 15, IQ 150, still elevating 16, he develops complex software code That detects weaknesses in cyber security protocols 17, and he sells his vision keeping a share Not yet an adult, but he's practically a millionaire 18, and his daddy tells him "Now you're a man This world don't give a damn about you, so take all that you can" 19, he turns a profit stocks and shares invest in product 20, double-down deposits, 21, his income rockets 22, he learns that truth is just an obstacle to wealth If you manipulate the data, then a lie will sell itself 23, a life of luxury, crystal and cocaine 24, he makes the Forbes list, they're applauding his name 25, and his daddy tells him, "Listen here, son While you are sitting in your palace, that don't mean that you won" 26, a business shift, he switches business to arms He's 27, dealing nuclear and shells in Iran 28, inside the Senate money bought him a seat He's 29, a role of the council in the president, sweet Now he’s 30 and his daddy says "You're losing the race You're just a servant to the king, not even in second place" 31, a big maneuver for his daddy’s approval Moving imports over borders from the exports out of Cuba 32, moving grams, growing kilos to tonnes He's 33, filling warehouses with powder and guns 34, turf war with nobody to stop it Blind eye from the po-po inside of his pocket 35 and he gets a call, "I'm sorry son It's your father, had a heart attack, I'm sorry, he’s gone" 36, getting pissed up, abusing his product 37, eyes glazed, disposition demonic 38, with a prostitute, a moment of passion Heating up a silver spoon and then chasing the dragon 39, getting reckless and hungry for power Daddy’s words still driving him to kill and devour He makes a move against the cartel, but the strategy's flawed They retaliate and leave him in a hospital ward A bullet buried in the vertebra and one in the leg The doctor sighs and says "I don’t think you’ll be walking again", fuck You might also like Seven Sins Ren Uninvited Ren Sick Boi, Pt. 2 Ren [Verse 2] Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy He was 40, and he cursed the words "Mine, mine, gimme" 41, he wasn’t walking, 42, not walking quickly 43, never running 'round the pavements of his city 44 inside his palace with a mountain of gold But those riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves Weighing heavy on his conscience is the value of gold A Lamborghini for a life, trading money for souls Jimmy followed the code inside the land of the free Put your hand inside the cookie jar, take more than you need And his example is exaggerated versions of me And it's a version of him, and it's a version of she And it's a version of you, there’s no escaping the blame The way we live is parasitic, fuck the money and fame! Cut the music!  [Verse 3] This ain’t entertainment, this is real-life The way we live is lunacy, community, it declines We're hyperpolarized, we're always fighting, and we divide Truth is less important than the money that we design? Money's an invention, politics from our invention They all come from peoples' ideas, did I mention? Borders? An invention, law, and order fuel the tension That leads to people killing each other. My solution? Everything is subject to change We could build utopias if individuals were taught to use their brains But if we teach kids in school to always be sheep And put ourselves before the herd if there's more money for me Then there’s no future I see, where the humans survive We're parasites inside a Petri dish with cannibal minds Mold will grow upon a surface, then consumes till it dies And our fate could be the same, so here's a story for the wise [Outro] 45, Jimmy comes home out of the rain Soaking wet upon a wheelchair, drinking again He is everything he wants, he has fortune and fame He’s a fortunate fool with an unfortunate fate With a 45 caliber aimed at his brain 45 - a fitting number, 'cause his age is the same Hears the words of his father; "Such a damn shame" Then he presses on the trigger of a money game
so good
The new Lucas Graham song - '7 years old' vibes
As always, artistic and powerful. Truly a generational artist. Thanks for sharing your gift with us.
Ren you just blow our minds over and over! Totally Brilliant!!
Wow. This was wild
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
too good
SOOOO GOOOOOOD
Poetry
Quite poetic my good sir, tif only we all could collaborate as are many ancestors have done time and time again, maybe this time our figureheads of such a foundation would be able to make a longer lasting impact, I think this poem is testament only next to Shakespeare of the fact of where most of our good men and women go which is to an early death and most time grievously by their own hands, we must not forget the great individuals that chooseth to make a difference when even all hope seems lost, you know this I trust and if not one need only seek or ask to find others who still have hope and if they are worthy they too will gain hope
Masterpiece.
why i'm getting Pagan Min vibes?
Wow no words literally
an excellence in songwriting, storytelling, and video
Crazy
❤❤❤
I'm old, but my childish soul needs a happy end😖
Wow no words 😮❤
Why do I choke up every time I see or hear your work?  You hit harder than anybody I know, REN.  Please keep it up because it seems like medicine for the world right now.  Big THANK YOU!
I have so much appreciation for you. Casually just throwing another masterpiece.. LEGEND!
F---ing amazing
The strings give me goosebumps every single time. Almost my favourite song of the whole album.
This is ART.
Definitely, he is a genius with a very particular style, but I personally prefer it when he uses more of his natural accent. BTW, he is giving more visibility to one of the biggest current problems of the society.
Incredible story!
Wow. 👏
PRIME REN
intro giving Bad Meets Evil - Above The Law vibes
How much money to make video like this ?...
Incredible! Best on yet!!
Just to say mid week chart in uk Ren has atm debuted #2 just behind Rick Astley, and beating Scouting for girls, and pink Floyd, what an amazing achievement my fellow Welshman and so earned 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🤟🤟🤟
🔥🔥🔥
touched and speechless. wow!
Knox is correct a masterpiece. Been awhile since I felt this way about a song.
That trigger discipline is making me sweat like hell
W O W
I thought I saw Thomas Shelby on the thumbnail.
I'm doing my part.
Speechless
Yo!… is that Knox take’n over on the piano!?
I find it cool that as the song proggresses the voice of the father becomes more and more like Jimmy
No words man other then thank you!
Cant wait for the first full musical with a message from Ren. Well, one can dream can't we?
The millennials version of Bob Dylan.  Great song writter.
I just became a fan😳
One simply does not listen to a new Ren-song for the first time without immediately listen to it for a second time. And a third, And a fourth, ...  God damn exceptional.
BOOO!!!
Wow
Well done Ren, the bit about sheep and school really resonated with me... LOVE IS THE ANSWER pls stay safe brother!
Sick Boi is literally THE BEST Album I've ever bought for £5. Worth it for this work of art, never mind the other 17 songs! Ren is one of my fave artists of all time. Period.
I LOVE YOU SO ❤
Did it again brother ❤ been spreading your music like a virus, more people need to appreciate you
whoosh,another part? its awesome! another masterpiece from this guy. what to say? it is ren after all this part is an explanation a conclusion a masterpiece
Goddamn! Good shit, as always.
Talented 👌🏻
I love the camera work! It feels surreal in this time without a single cut... reminds me of Children of Man.. great work by everyone involved!!! thank you very much
💔💔💔
no words
I absolutely enjoy your work #ren. This is my first rap alum and I’m enjoying the art. As a classical musician, I can hear this as a rap opera (I’m not sure if that exists). It certainly has the drama of an opera. The lyrics I believe gives us the raw glimpse into the toxic behavior of humanity. During the 1980s an English comic book creators Alan Moore/David Lloyd created, “V for Vendetta.” There are some great quotes about society’s need for power and dominance over others to the horror and destruction of society. One character named Evie says something profound, “ *Artists use lies to tell the truth, while politicians use them to cover the truth up.*” @ren you’re work has that vibe. Thank for sharing a perspective many are too blind to see or actively passive about. The essay ends here😂 ✌️
🙏❤️
Always such good and meaningful music
I...cried 🐧 I cant even form sentences, THIS WAS PHENOMENAL
man, dude lovely, love you loads...please keep playin for a long time!! you give more then enough, from me just love
Crazy good!
Amazing
bump⬆
Pleas make a song whit nf that would be 🔥🔥
Idk why it's in my recommended well see  edit : Pass...
First speechless. Ever .
Holy shit.
It'll be a hard truth for some. Hopefully this starts conversations and change.
Un.Believable.  PURE ART
❤
Always better than last time Ren!
💰💰💰💰💰💰💰
Ren, i’m 22 years old. the great man i met in the streets and fell in love with has been years lost to the dragons, i work a corporate job and pretend everyday that i never seen that world out there. world of people who didn’t have much themselves but never stopped giving nonetheless. i honestly am hurting a lot just watching the worlds unfold in front of me. it makes me wonder everyday wether i should keep playing the game at all…
😌
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Pure Art
💰💰💰
That's rite Knox Hill 🤭✌🏼
Wow
I listen to his music up and down...
shame shame shame
Your talent to bring issues into your lyrics, the demise of society, the loss of identity, to be the same. Genius ❤
With the style in which Ren writes his music, I could see a musical based on his music.  And I'd be lined up to watch it.
Wow... just wow!
Luigi lookin dapper
“How about a nice game of chess” 😉✌️❤️
Probably the most pretentious video and comments I've seen...yawn.
bro looks like tommy shelby's long lost cousing. should probably play a character in peaky blinders. great song
Espectacular 😊😊😊
Ren is an unique artist. there is no word that can describe how amazing he is
wow ... love it. sometimes it need the pain to wake up others
A big Fan of Ren and Samuel from the moment I have discovered Ren 6 months ago and watched all the work he did together with Samuel. Two super creative minds.  Loved the story telling and the intensity of the video. Some parts of the video production and symbolisms reminded me of  the brilliantly disturbing video " This is America" by Childish Gambino. I know Ren wanted to end the Hi Ren video with a su*c*de ending but changed it with a message of hope in the end. I see he used that idea on Money Game 3. Overall brilliant work, another great Samuel and Ren creation.
How you can do this, you gust read my mind
Woah
This IS entertainment)
Woah. I loved pt2 so much but this might even be better.
intense.   loving the dedication and artistry. sad he's just telling the blank truth and spits it and we listend and think of it as art because one opens his mouth. let's hope for the world and everyone livin ...
Incredible work
another masterpiece!
❤ I have no words to describe. Thank you. Sending my love ❤️
Goosebumps for 9 minutes streight! Extraordinary!
Epic as always. I love the Money Game series <3
Ren  this is geniunely a masterpiece
How can we call this music genre?
Absolutely incredible
Coming back here seeing the one million mark, is breathtaking. The video, as always, sparks conversation and thought. Ren and his team have work tirelessly and it shows. What a commitment!  As much as we would like to keep Ren to ourselves is as much as his artistry deserves to be shared with the world. RENegades for the RENaissance!!
You're breathtaking
I’m speachless
Excellent  Bravo More please
Found part two a few days back and now got part three, fantastic music, lyrics and meaning
This one dude just rethought what Muse should have become.
my solution... stop the masterbation blinding the whole nation
This is the best message i've seen for a long time, wow. Respect 100%
Just a taste of some of my favourite take aways…  “Man”- every time. It’s primal. It’s Caesar the ape. It’s aggressive. It’s passed down The pour of the drink to illustrate the consequence of the night of passion and the fate of the prostitute  The fact you can sing along the money game pt 1 and 2 hook hauntingly over the track…try it slow behind the start of the lyrics! Both this and the Jenny and screech tales are about the cycle of bullshit we pass down perpetuating the cycle of suffering. These are about what we tell our children. Hi ren is about what we tell ourselves!

Wow.. ive shared this w a few ppl..  man just to see the reactions of truth hit them, marinade on that for a while
Such a masterpiece, truly beautiful
Wow, just wow.
Dam Ren so glad to see ya good work brother I am so tired of this money game we are all trapped in
Ren... amazing work ❤
so, where is the guitar
What a poet. Brilliant 👍
Bravo! Do you think this will put an end to you metaphorically or literally trying to blow your brains out? That imagery stresses us fans out wickedly ❤
Genio Ren, como siempre!
AMAZING! Beautifully done, man! This is another, in a series of "way too real" underappreciated pieces of true artist genius. And Samual's cinematic style and artistry on full display here. Great piece all around.
Amazing art.
This guy.
One word: MASTERPIECE!
you know, the first song of yours I found was money game. the first one. I listened to that song and my thought was: "wow, he is a guy that understands the world." and I was... somehow sorry for you. because it's a  burden you have to carry that won't ever go away. after that I started to listen to your other songs and i found "depression". and i cried. i struggle with depression my almost entire life and I think I have never met anyone that would understand how i feel... but your song, your words.. they shower me i am not alone. i became a fan of yours, i'm following your career and i am proud of what you achieve, if a fan can say that. i am so happy to know that there is a person like you in the world and that there are people that listens to you. you are amazing ren. you can make a change
Another great piece of performance art - wonderful!
1.1M in 3 days...🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
This FANTASTIC!!!!! GREAT WORK!!
nice
thank you
Master Ren in action! Brilliant as always and mind-blowing!
Best video 2023 for sure!
From chills to tears, a masterpiece. Incredible! Everything about this, down to the smallest details. The message in your work is definitely needed. ❤ 🎹
right to my heart
All the nice cinematography aside, the video complains that "Truth is less important than the money that we design."  So truth is important?  And we should follow the truth?   So what is Ren's "solution"?  He wants to eliminate money, politics, borders, and law and order.   He wants us to "use our brain" to achieve "utopia" because "everything is subject to change."  This all sounds reminiscent of enlightenment philosophy (God is dead),  Evolutionism, Marxism, and Communism.  Which are the very philosophies and political systems that literally led to the death, in the 20th century alone, of millions of people---mostly committed by governments against their own people.  Ren has identified part of the problem but he has no solution other than more of the same.  It almost sounds like he is primed for the coming of the New World Order and it's one world government.
wow dude
silly
So fuckin amazing 😮😮😮. Great work 👏👏👏👏 Ren thank u❤
WEIRDO !!! GET BACK TO BUSKING IN SHIP STREET
Didn't know I could hold my breath for nine minutes and nineteen seconds. I should take up free diving.
Masterpiece.
glorious
!!!!!
.
One of the best things I've seen lately, they absolutely nailed it.
tsetsouch!
Im not sure if anyone has spotted Jimmy is short for James. Jimmy's "Father" speaks to him first at age 5.. James Chapter 5 in the bible is called A Warning to Rich Oppressor's about the misery which will come from wealth and self indulgence... His father also speaks to him at age 13 and 18 = chapter 5:13-18 "Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven." A reference to the Sick boi theme, sins and opportunity to resolve thise sins. Im not religious but this understates the IQ and genius of Ren
Ren always gives you that shock factor that most artists rarely ever do.....THIS WAS AN EXPERIENCE!!!!!
Amazing music video. With over a million view I don’t see why there are only 70k likes! Yo guys what y’all doing?!?
Every piece of this man is art, the main line in the otghers (rain rain rain...) could perfectly fit at the end of this song, faces are awesome an the message kind of frustrating but realistic, this is the world we live in and its cool people from other country, economic situation or social relations as me may have the same ideas about how money works... We are all part of this money game but thinking by yourself isnt any game
can't wait to binge-watch every reaction I find on it haha
The boys done it again 👏🏼  Artistic masterclass after artistic masterclass
Jimmy was basically living in his father's idea of a perfect life.  But when his father died his idea died with him. Now jimmy must live life based on his own ideas but he has none.
Brilliant. Just wow!!  Is this music and lyrics also live? :o
Beautiful!
this is incredible....
Genius.
Wow.... Another chilling reminder that things are not always as they appear from the outside. Money doesn't cure all evils. Sometimes its their root.....
Absolutely incredible in every way
Brilliant
Insane ❤🔥🔥🔥🔥 the truth is sad!!
this kid is the only one worth listening to in 2023
What the F@C# was that!? Poetry!!! Pure poetry!!!
Wow, I'm speechess. Always a story behind these pieces. 👏👏
Amazing work man
this is so good!
Music has been so dry for me. But this…this and this man brings me hope.
Just wow.
47 world is laughing 'cos the dead dont complain 48 the truth is galling we arent one and the same 49 crimes a calling dont get hung up on fame. 5 decades, wild natured, already dead if your tamed.
This is art 🙏
awesome!
Absurdly incredible
Dear YouTube, why can I give only one thumb up if I have two? I would like to give at least 1000 from myself, so that world could hear Ren's words 💥 Brilliant piece of art, thank you Ren!
Once in a decade you might be lucky enough to see an artist like Ren. No comp, best storyteller there is at the moment.  Genuinely don't envy the rich, But I do envy the people that have talent in every bone in their body 😂
Please stop doing musik . You are probably one of the worst artist right now . This is so cringy how can no one see that
Money Game Part 4  Jimmy takes aim at his brain. The gun miss fires, when he takes his finger off the money game, the gun falls to the floor, and at that moment it hits the ground and the sound of the gun going off, and the ringing in his ears, an apiphany entails. He'll just be another statistic in the, News media's code. Lifting his head to the sky, fists clenched so tightly, and shaking profusely. "Father, I have shame for my Sins, and I'm starting to understand. I will use my wisdom, and the Money game for good! 46 years old and He's cleaned himself up, and takes the raines of his life back, and phones a few places he still knows of, and gets back in to the game, but this time he has light in his heart and changes the money into greatness. Giving the young and the older in need, a chance to live a better life. Positivity exchanged for the life of the Money Game. 47, 48, 49, he keeps going, and at the,  Magic number, of 50, he finally breaks the seashells on the sea shore and gives back the hope for a better future, for us all to aspire.  - The glass is half full

i knew the second he started singing infront of the mirror this was gonna be a banger
Bravo... Always a pleasure to take in every aspect of your artistic abilities.... 🎵🎵
A genuine period piece. Defines this decade of greed and war.
❤❤
Wow ❤
Wow, once again Ren you have nailed it. This such a poignant summary of whats wrong woth the world. People wrapped up chasing wealth and forgetting to live. No fucking wonder we haven't been invited to the galactic BBQ, were so fucked up greedy and feral we'd just ruin it for everyone else.
"Truth is just an obstacle to wealth", based!
This is SO good
Mesmerizing! Perfection at work Ren! Where can we find the intro countdown of the guy playing the Money Game riff on the guitar? Was brilliant!
1 Million views with 1 Million Subs!  Lost my dad at 35 and this story unfortunately sounds a lot like mine and many others. Thank you so much for this Ren!
Shit ren. You've done it again. Voice of the people.
1.1 mil. views! ❤
Un. Believable.
Quick walking lowers terminal calories, quick spiritual growth is a long emotional journey.
What the tommy shelby doing here ?
I clicked "like" but then I removed. I can't possibly like such ending. I love Ren and look forward to his next masterpiece. Love from the Middle East ❤
I’ve been following Ren since he was busking in the streets, and he never fails to hit the perfect spot.
Great video. But the first 2 are better
Magnificent. Each time I think you can't possibly set the bar higher, you do it again. Thanks to everybody involved in creating this supreme work of art.
Crazy video
Over a million views in 3 days REN ITS HAPPENING ❤❤❤❤
Bravo 👏👏👏👏
Just discovered this...doubling back for Parts 1 & 2! Holy shit...shook. 😮 ❤Masterpiece!!
the one who did the mix of this project did the best job on Rens tracks today!
Nice fade Ren. I ain't buying it's you playing that piano though ( a fade is a haircut)
Brilliant Ren. Simply spot on accurate. Go on, push the limits of lyrics.
Bravo 👏
Ren is unlike any other artist, this is incredible.
A musical analysis of Money Game 1-3 by Ren  So, Money Game are three songs made by the British singer  Ren. They talk about the game that is capitalism and how eventually we all lose to it, no matter how smart you are, you always end up with your finger in the trigger of the Money Game.   The first one, the critique:  https://youtu.be/0ivQwwgW4OY?feature=shared  Talks mostly about how bad the game is, how this twisted and evil game we play turns everyone into a monster that refuses to turn the mirror to ourselves, always pointing the blame and never stopping to realize that by pointing the blame, you already are playing the game.  Then, we move onto the second one, the guide: https://youtu.be/YonS9_QJbp8?feature=shared  This one starts criticizing the game but quickly jokes about it and instead, starts to explain how to play this game, the most effective tactic avaliable and what you should expect to happen, but certainly, no one would play the game like that. Right?  Third one, The Warning:  https://youtu.be/nyWbun_PbTc?feature=shared  This one, this one is rather sad. We finally get to see what happens when someone follows the guide, we see the wicked truth of this world we live in. This song is a warning to all of us, it's basically a way to say "follow the guide and you might end up like little jimmy", but why? Jimmy did everything right, he sold more than seashells, ran for president, swallowed his morals. But even then, he lost, he didn't step up to the stage, the world still wasn't his. It's as if the game was rigged from the start. I believe all three songs are connected somehow, each one complementing the last one until we get to this one. Someone that didn't know the game but entered it anyway, isn't that what happens to all of us? We are put into this unwillingly and forced to play, forced to dance to this horrible tune that none of us really know the rules for, yet we manage to just barely make it out alive. The harder we resist, the closer we are to break, change will come, that's the only constant in life other than death and taxes. So be careful out there,be careful when playing this old money game, because when you realize you're playing it your finger will already be on the trigger of a   Money Game
very deep

Love you ren
This isn’t just art, it’s a journey for the heart, mind and soul.  I’m so moved right now.
This is the tits! Amazing work Ren.
Nice.
You sir, are a poet, an artist, a story teller. Your unique mind and ability to convey stories through emotions never ceases to amaze me. On one hand it saddens me that this world we have created for ourselves drives people to produce these creations through pain, but on another, I am thankful that amidst the dark, we have people like you that can express and create, and for that I’m thankful.
Another  musical masterpiece
KUDOS to Ren and Sam. You guys basically condensed a 2 hour biopic into a 10 minute music video. Just wanted to take a moment to apreciate the artistic feat apart from the message. Videos like this are why I love Youtube so much as a viewer.
Dad you have outdone yourself! Congratulations for 1 Million views! 🎉You Super Star! Sick Boi album is 🔥❤️❤️ Thank you!
You arouse emotions that I have never felt while listening to music. You’re intense and precious Ren, please never stop being you.
Wow
Truly a Masterpiece !!
Ren you truly are a visionary with an ever increasing number of disciples.  Have you thought seriously into parliament itself, Lucas is standing down in Brighton would be possible to get in with your great repute.  Wishing you all the best and hope your illnesses are behind you.
This is brilliant.
Mastervibez❤

It's hard to call it a song, but it's definitely the best creation by Ren thus far. And just a hint of what's yet to come. Great ideation, composition, writing, execution, and production. He's truly the master of all trades.  Congratulations to the world, and thank you @RenMakesMusic.
What even????? Masterpiece
This guy is whole next level. love from Nepal.
Love it as always! Ren your Stories are next level captivating!
If I would be Jimmie 😂😂,  would pay all all my money to have a feature between Ren & and Alicia Keys. But i don t think the owners of free people would like that:))) still gotta try @aliciakeys
This is what we love Ren for!!
Quality
Pushing it forward for the algorithm, thank you Ren for fighting the collective mental struggle and opening eyes and hearts across the world ❤️ Truly a masterpiece this one
Wow
I hear you, Ren.
Im listening to Ren from jennys tale and none of next songs let me down. Its only get better
Ren's is without a doubt the number 1 musician that I'd just like to have a conversation with to pick his brain, the way it works and puts some of his musical ideas together is just amazing to me. Keep up the good work brotha
YOU ARE THE BEST REN !!!! KEEP DOING YOU!

"the way we live is parasitic"  THIS. SO MUCH THIS. 🖤
After growing up in the eighties there isn't a whole lot of music I like these days, this kid has an original style in his music and I love it! 🤘🏼👏🏼🤘🏼👏🏼🤘🏼👏🏼🤘🏼👏🏼
This music video was shot using the new iPhone XV.....I was honestly waiting for that to pop up on the screen 😂
It's beautiful art in my eyes, I play your music on my UI boom at work in new Zealand, much love
Wow another master piece 👌❤
Great Job! Ren could play the Joker! 🙂
THANK YOU Ren for waking up humanity in us. 💚🙏💚
Congratulations on 1 Million views Ren.
MASTERPIECE
Omg. He did it again.
Fellow Lymie here - haven't commented previously because I consistently end up speechless from your astonishing combination of insane talent, heart, intelligence, creativity, spot-on insights and compassion that are so rightfully bringing you much deserved acclaim.  It's truly hard to articulate the impact your visionary music and messages are having on so many people.  I so hope that the treatment in Canada is successful and not too grueling, and you are able to enjoy the next chapter of your rising star journey while continuing to inspire and unite so many people who needed you to show up and allow them to feel seen and understood.  And this is not limited to those struggling with chronic illness and/or mental health challenges.  The world needs you on so many levels.  You're truly magic, Ren - thank you for delivering such beautiful gifts in spite of what has had to be a colossal and sometimes dauntingly exhausting effort through years of what I know first hand is often a living hell that only those who have been through it can appreciate.  I'd love to swap stories of what has been most effective for me, but everyone is different in what our immune systems respond to, and I hope you're receiving the best of the best there is to offer to bring you through the gauntlet.  You're a reminder of how much brilliance gets locked up by cruel, relentless and frequently misunderstood chronic illness and you are shining a brilliant and much needed light on the world. <3
Holy shit!! 1M  in 3 days!! So happy for you!!
This is so good, I have no words...
Thank you Cillian Murphy for this beautiful song.
Oh God!
This is the first time I am seeing/hearing this artist. This song/video kept me glued in the entire 9 mins.  Does Ren sing too? Sounds like it! Knoxhill!!!!❤ much love
He looks like Thomas Shelby
Fight back
Wow…
Incredible artistry. WELL DONE
I love you, bud ❤ best wishes with your current and upcoming treatments. I hope they continue to heal you, Ren. You deserve to breathe easy.
God he's good
You get better and better every song. Honestly, a genius.
What genre is this even? Great work ❤️
Genius
am i watching oppenheimer ?
I noticed something I haven't heard anyone speak about.  His cross earring was replaced with a smaller loop that is closer to his ear lobe.  I have never seen him without the cross earring.
Love what you’re doing bro!
1 M in 3 days🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
One word.... WOW!
I thought Hi Ren was brilliant and i still do. Yes the world is a crazy place  no one person deserves any more than they sow. What you don't sow you owe be thankful!
The orchestra part is so touching. Did Ren wrote that orchechstra piece?
How Ren continues to put out soul striking, lyrical delicacies that hit harder than our trauma filled, sex fueled, numbed out world is legitimately a miracle.
My mans saw the Luigi meme and had to make a Mario reference lol.
Hear a lot of Lin Manuel Miranda inspo
Ren!!! My brother from another mother!!!❤ I don't know if you will read this comment but I'm 38 years old now and rap and rock and roll music have been just blah or average at best since the late 90's early 2000 and you and your beautiful beautiful mind and creativity have made me interested in music again. So keep doing what you do best you don't know it yet but you are a top 10 of ALL TIME musical genius in the making. Stay happy and healthy 🙏 brother and remember God doesn't challenge the weak he makes people like you stronger to inspire the masses. God bless you 🙏🎉
Amazing... just simply Amazing
cant believe it went from luigi explaining british economics to this
God, Ren you are a genius. Absolute genius man. You inspire me to create music, I learned acoustic because of you, thank you bruv. You're actually a musical GOD.
Commenting for the algorithm. Absolutely stunning work both in music and in message

Comment
Disfrutando tu video en México!!! Espero que llegue a muchos más países ❤
Excellent 🎉
Man this guy is the best artist I know of today thanks for the music Ren
Going back to the "hi Ren" Type stuff, Love it bro. You're doing amazing shit here.
This song just gets better and better each time I listen to it, great work.
"inside the senate, money bought him a seat." Yup😢  Another masterpiece Ren.  Gracias totales!!  Except most are at the least narcissists, probably sociopaths, with no conscience.
holy hell, this is so good
Masterpiece
You never fail to make some of the most impressive and beautiful works using music as a storytelling medium, with some of the most important messages of any artist I know. Chills all the way through.
Ren, congratulations! 1 million views in less than 3 days! I'm so happy for you.
Story teller ..or telling story's?
Amazing
Thommy Shelby decided to sing
This song was absolutely amazing, and the lyrics were a beautiful retrospective. The Money Game parts are always a knock out of the park.
This is so good
Dude my heart dropped when I saw a third part to this master piece.
You're just awesome <3
Day 4 - think this might be my favourite song
Once again very strong words and a message that is so true.
Ren's about to go stratospheric!  Have you seen the latest iTunes charts from countries around the World?  Mad!   :)
Part 2 - 3 years ago Part 3 - 3 days ago
Amazingly artistic piece! Creativity was oozing from every second it all. Your heart as a human is always openly and honestly worn on your sleeve but also shows, translates & is woven into your story telling, though music, sounds, sights, words and all the emotions you provoke with pieces you weave together. Amazing Mate! Now, stop, breathe, sleep, eat well, do things to slow the world down and enjoy just being you. 1M views in 2 days. Not surprised, You earned it Son. Luv from Scotland ❤
Huge fan of your art... I have an idea... Write us a song where someone lives their life properly... We've seen how we shouldn't do it, now let's see an example of someone doing it right
U are my favorite artist!
This is a MASTERPIECE!!
Another absoloute banger that needs to be on a stage at GLASTONBURY hope you take it live soon. come to Frome and test it ;)
Holy shit.  Thats all i can say
Absolute genius ❤
camera work
Most criminally underrated artist on Earth.
An amazing artist on all fronts. Let's hope he doesn't get picked up to star in Peaky Blinders 😉
Back again, to listen to yet another masterpiece from a musical genius, a once in a generation talent and a thoroughly decent human being!   :)
Baghead gang rise up
you undid your tie when you sat down at the cocaine table. And that was the un-winding.......
I'ma smash this shit about 100 times in a row!!!
the same vibe for 3 videos over 3 years. impressive interconnectivity, well done
Love love love
Damn
Pure genius ❤
I’ve had to come back and comment again.  This is truly the best thing I’ve heard of yours and that’s some compliment ❤
Sounds like a Hamilton rip off 🦧
Beautiful
Congrats on a MILLION views
I love your message. It's one I've never written about but attempted to many times. Ever wonder why the boogie man is hiding under your bed? Key word being 'hiding' In all the best scary stories, people are the monsters.  I've always envied your work because the songs you write are so similar to mine. I envisioned releasing my music to the world one day and just never did. You embody and exceed in most cases all of my talents and you spread the words I never got to share.  Never sell out, Ren. Your voice is more important than ever.
I love you Ren.  Only a slight voice of meh.  Your best songs and videos have come with a distinctive tune and I didn't find one here.
this needs to get 100 million+ views legit
❤ Money game !!!!!
Absolutely fikkking art!!! The imagery, the song, the tension. Dammmittt why are you so damn amazing?!?
Leave it to Ren to build a entire career out of ONE SONG. This shits amazing. He’s literally visibly aged since the first version.
When Ren starts a performance with "Let me tell you a story...", you know you are in for a RIDE.
Wow, 1M views! Sweet!!!!❤️
Over 1 million As of Sunday, 15 October
1 million!! 🎉woo hoo!
Enorme hermano, la enseñanza y la vida deben tomar nuevos caminos, alejarse del capital y del ego, asomarse hacia el humanismo... y debe pasar ahora. Saludos desde México 🇲🇽... que siga el Arte, que siga la Denuncia, que siga la Revolución!!
Ren = Art ❤❤
Stop calling it art and listen to the message, thats what its meant for.
I only hope that you understand your lyrics. You are a genius. There is no way you understand how much you mean  We love you!!
Wow!
Another absolute pleasure to watch. Social commentary is always on point, love everything you do sir!
Good lord. Where did this genius come from?
Stunning. Just such a great observation of the worst effect of capitalism.
Also, not usually one to comment on videos, but this Artist and team deserve all the help and reach they can get. Great work. 👍
Pure Genius. Ren, you make me think. Thank you for that.
So let’s all comment, and continue wasting time it’s insane.  Let’s unwind, and buy some beers so we can silence our brains.  Let’s click the like button and forget what we’ve gained.  Let’s go back to work for those Ren mentioned, and keep playing the game.  Or shall we stand up, get together and come up with a plan?  Or are too far gone to to realized we’re already owned by the man?
Is there anything Ren cannot do? This one was powerful. Ren should make movies. Ren studios would be massive. The storytelling ability of this man is unmatched
Real talk, REN is the new age NAS the way he be tellin stories!!!
gg's.
no surprise this hit a mill in 3 days it is that good
Ren is making me, a metal head, appreciate rap music. Nothing short of a miracle, I must say. Brilliant.
Ren, I owe you an apology. I'm sorry I thought you were selling your album for $95 USD. I saw an advertisement that was requesting $95. The kind folks in this room have educated me where to really go to purchase your album at an affordable price. I should have known you'd never play the money game. So very sorry. I'm somewhat naive and gullible.  I meant what I said in my last text about loving your music. Thanks for sharing your music with the world!
Oh my goodness! My husband and I surprised my parents with their first international trip-- Scotland!-- when this was getting ready to drop. I am heartbroken to have missed out on Ren's mastermind games, but I have goosebumps in finding out that it ended in Scotland. My heart is so full having had such a lovely time with my parents and even more full coming back and listening to this beautiful piece. Thank you Ren!
Another comment for the algo. Ren this is incredible
Flame emojis to the max bunji
Would love to see Ren do something with @annenmaykantereit
Whoa...as always...beauty!
I'm a 62 year-old American artist who's in love with this guy/his work! He is a visionary. Would love to see a collaboration between him and OK GO. And, he needs to start making feature length films. BRILLIANT!
Congrats on 1 million views 👏
Cillian murphy goin wild

thanks Ren. +99
Best artist of our time right here.  Thank you for putting your effort and creativity into this Ren. Beautiful song. Let's shake things up
Amazing, what a way to complete this Money Game trilogy.  I can't wait to see what he continues to create.
Absolute Art amazing in every sense of the word
This man don't miss.
Lyrical greatness keep on sending it🤙
Brilliant
So good to see this hit a million views already
Ren you're so real with everything you say and the meaning of your words. The way we live is pure lunacy, and it's probably all about to get even worse with all hell breaking out worldwide wars. I'm just gonna keep sittin by my fire in the back yard and watch birds fly over my pond. It's nice to be away from people other than my wife and son. Keep on the good work Ren
I hear the message but unfortunately there are so many other factors and reasons as to why what you're selling will never be the one. It won't happen, because everyone on here is getting their fix with one minute youtube clicks....
I love you Ren omg this song is so incredible and beautiful at the same time and should be recognised by everyone and all the music industry. You are extremely talented and remind me of young Eminem in 2007 with that flow of rapping!
Thank you ren
Ren is a Generational Talent.  Nothing else needs to be said.
1M in 3 days! The World is recognizing Ren! Hope the message gets through...
1,000,000 views in 3 days. 😮
Dude you just deserve everything. Thank u.
ONE MILLION VIEWS!!! Congratulations !!!!!!
The single shot is insane.
I read the comments and see peoples reactions to you, Ren, and i feel the need to have my say on how great your music is and how your lyrics have helped me decipher a lot of the feelings i could never put into words.... but when trying to say something, the words to describe you dont seem to be strong enough. Your music and performance are beyond words. I appreciate you and am grateful and respectful of the journey you have had to endure, which allows us to find understanding and solace in your music. Thank you for being you ❤️ 😊
I literally spent my entire weekend listening to this and analyzing it... this was so cool. Thank you Ren, your art really is that. Art. Something that makes me think and experience emotion simultaneously.
Just hit 1m views. Congratulations! 🖤
Oof. Werent expecting any of that
He looks like Tomas Shelby from peaky blinders
ren should make a play
Too many protest singers, not enough protest songs. Then you come along

Awsome song !

Congratulations Ren! 1M views in 3 days. You knocked this one out of the park. Well done! Much love from the USA❤
Just hit 1 million views 💯💯
Both 'Money Game 3' and 'Hi Ren' are nine minutes and nineteen seconds long.  Conspiracy?  I believe!  I want a REN doll with him in a suit!
One million views in 3 days and 4 hours and 38 minutes.  That's a new Ren record!
Unique music artist and storyteller. Keep going Ren we appreciate you so much ❤️ Oh and particularly love that melancholic string section.
1M
Watching it again - almost to 1,000,000 in 3 days!!!  ❤💜❤️
A very realistic connotation of our present era. But this is not to sway us away from reaching the top, we just have to reach wisely and normatively.
Truly inspired. Ren just keeps providing brilliance again and again.  A true modern day poet.
Very cool take, shot lovely. Good man.
Brazil 😍
I've only just come across your work recently and honestly Ren you're incredible. Your voice, the writing, your music as whole is incredible but what I'm honestly truly drawn to is the theatrics of it all. As someone that's studied acting and has a degree in acting your characterization and story telling is phenomenal! It really inspires me and makes me feel excited and passionate about wanting to be an actor again. Gutted I didn't come across you sooner. Excited to see what you do next! 🎉
Such a vast array of musicians & actors all collaborating Perfectly synchronised & beautifully captured by Beau Prichard-James. I remember Ren's "massive big up" to Sam Perry-Falvey re 'The Tale of Jenny & Screech' (I couldn't help noting the camera skill when I 1st seen it).. now Director of Photography! SO MUCH GOING ON.. yet once again, even THIS entire MASTERPIECE.. All in 1 Shot, X
So stellar. And Sam, my god....this team all of you...gravitational force of creative expression.   The talent oozes out of this piece from everyone 🎉🎉🎉❤
999k
The man have is a legend
not long back from the sick boi garden party, had such an awesome time seeing the set and meeting everyone, brings watching it again to a whole new level. such an achievement by all of you. im so excited to watch you all do well
Went to the Sunday evening album release, great to meet you all, shame I couldn’t stay for the drink. Peace and love ❤ money stinks…
I know this sounds cynical, and don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of Ren and his brilliance, but I can't help but wonder: how much money did it take to make this video, and how much money has he made from this song? How much money will be made from all three money game songs? The irony is quite evil, I must admit.
998k in 3 days
This song gives me chills and makes me rethink my whole life.
Your musically talent is outstanding, but your acting, your power to create a scene - an atmosphere, your words whether you´re singing or rapping...this art has to become a classic of all time.  I love your rap-tracks, but especially "songs" - performances like Money Game, Hi Ren or the "Tales Trilogie" finally breaking the wall between so many kinds of art, it´s unbelievable. I hope we will see a  theater play of yours or can some day read an epic book written by you.  Special thanks to all the performers, to Samuel and all the people that believe in you and help you to create this masterpieces 🤩
Burn the money!! Keep warm❤️‍🔥
Thank you Ren; for all the hard work that went into this, for Sam’s amazing work and everyone who made this happen and to all the people that made moneygame3 come to life (Jake/Jen 😊 Viktus, Joe, Josh and the people’s names that have escaped my mind)   You’ve so many authentic and innate talents:- a story teller, musician, composer, lyricist, producer, a unique artistic AND I do call you ‘hope’.  Your intellect, emotional intelligence and humbleness is refreshing. Opening eyes, ears, hearts and advocating for those who feel like they have no voice. I appreciate your honesty. You’ve created a community that is bound by love, compassion, empathy and understanding- the joy of music and performance. Did I mention… you’re fabulous? It’s a given. BIG LOVE. Please take the time to rest. We aren’t going anywhere - nub uh ❤
Still walking and 45 aimed at all the strangers too the game in it for only money and fame Your story’s ya shame not the words from your father, it’s just a memory game. Cut loose and and fill the years with moments of flame, set it ablaze but remember the name and step outside of the societal system that’s all rusted with insane. With hopes of future brighter, only need me not a writer, my brain reacts when a gun is my flame. Jimmy it’s like you said, me and you both one in the same ,you just need to step out of the rain… get ahead of the game,pull yourself that gold and be the breaker of chains, independent label and save yourself from all of your independent shame, I’m Keith your Jimmy Don’t forget my name. Can’t be tamed, Ooooo Ooooo Chooo Choooo Silence calls, and now I go and walk down towards the train.-        Ya got skills man and look forward to you have full expression. We are a lot alike….-Keith-Remember the name.
Damn
There is no utopia. It come back around
so part 1 was amazing part 2 was better 10 seconds in, let's see how part 3 does (I will edit the comment afterwards)  damn, I was not expecting that one
I love the classical addition , my favourite is Clair De lune, afew notes you played at the beginning sounded like a sample of it , anyway hope your well mate , Lee from middlesbrough, uk
Incredible 👏👏👏
Ren, you and your crew are just amazing talented people.  your songs, the videos, the artistic talent from everything you all touch.  Thank you for continuing to impress me by everything you release.  its nice to have an artist i can love who is truly talented and not just a one hit wonder or product of the music game.  if i know your hands are in it, most likely it will be gold.  I speak blessings over you and may God continue to let you use your talent.
It’s impressive how much better is the video version, which is much slower in 100-102 bpm on the fist piano part, compared to the album one which is around 160 bpm, 60% faster! Like a different song! How much clearer the piano melody can be heard in the slower one and how much deeper is the feeling/emotion I get! On the other hand the string part is just a bit faster on the video version
Nailed it once again, incredible visual storytelling! Kudos to you and your crew.
This is brilliant
Damn Ren! Please never ever stop doing what you're doing. The enlightenment, inspiration, wisdom and joy I have absorbed from your artistry has changed me as a person.  I don't comment on performer's channels very often but for everything you have done to help me in a tangible way, I feel that sharing my gratitude, respect and love is the very minimum I can do. I hope you know what you mean to so many people. I feel like I'm a disciple of yours because I try to share your music with others as much as possible. In all honestly it would be selfish of me not to and see it as a responsibility.  I feel lucky that I found you and will be eternally grateful 🙏 🫶
Ren is a MASTERPIECE! FUCK!
bin echt müde, aber die millionen möchte ich noch sehen! also los leute!!!!!!!
Absolute genius 👏
Ren is the most talented artist I've seen in 20 years. Everything he puts out just amazes me.  Keep it up, man... WOW.
As always simply awesome
BRILLIANT BRILLIANT BRILLIANT.
Getting a little tired of these preachy theatrical acts, people using drama to sell product to angsty teens, a bit like American Idol (everyone has a sob story, mostly imagined or stolen). Nice performance though, good from a commercial point of view. Artistically: talented, but too formulaic and derivative for my taste. It's inauthentic, staged, manipulative, simplistic, pretentious, designed for effect. Not musically or intellectually satisfying, too desperate for fame, seems to me. Maybe later, when he's not focused on gaining an audience and pretending to be someone/something.  Sorry for being so negative, the performance just comes across as grandiose and pretentious, and the mix with rap/activism/storytelling seems to serve as an excuse to overlook deficiencies. He's definitely talented though, so maybe later.
No entiendo el final😅 Si se va a pegar un tiro en la cabeza porque pone más de 1 bala?😂
Incredible
Usaually, <long pause here> i leave fullscrenn immediately. But this time, i sat in my chair and i was looking onto my screen with empty eyes and i had to let to sink in just what. Ren, you and the visual producers are a geniuses!
Al Gore Rhythm = Won Mill Young
We all need to look in the mirror, what a journey this amazing artist leads us on , the production is stunning. Thank you Sam and Ren.
My dear god, that was one of the most incredible things I've ever witnessed. You are truly a credit to our species. <3
Ren... No words can explain my feelings right now after the whole focusing on the song with it's meanful lyrics... Shocked of it's end, speechless of it's logic. The only thing i could say to you Ren is : WOW
Going to be honest, not loving it to be honest
Muy bueno! Aunque no entienda todo, pero a nivel musical, buenisimo y a nivel de actuación genial! Se nota que sientes lo que dices!
Simply awesome. Ren and Sam- What an incredible team. Please keep it up!
So sick !
I didn't know Thomas Shelby be spittin such heat... My gawd
Where 10m views?
1 000 000 lets go ! ! !
Great song!
Absolutely breathtaking story delivery.  The passion behind your words is palpable. Thank you
the camera work makes this already amazing song 10x better its amazing to see how Ren has grown through the years
This is not just a song, this is a wonderful performance. Keep it up man! ❤
Mate, your style is unique and it is something to be very proud of these days. Animal flow, Power, Sick Boy and Hi Ren is best though❤ I’d love to meet you👊  Your lyric is stunning, but the videos are making it AWESOME!
Great performance!
My God!
i feel like
BRAVO! 🌹
I am a big fan though this is my first comment on one of your works. Speaking as an art professor in NYC, let me just say this is superlative in every way. And to Samuel, it looks phenomenal.
🌟
This is more than a song. This is a statement piece.
Rat race-so true 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Purely brilliant and guess what we've found the next Bond 😉🎬
👍🏻👌🏻😎🥰
Whe need a Ren and NF colab please!!!!
Absolute Masterpiece! True poetry man. You are an inspiration. Both the music and visuals, so also cudos to Sam! The combination of your poetry and Sams masterful videos keeps us riveted and happy! Thank you!
POWERFUL STUFF
Thank You For Thie Masterpiece ❤️❤️❤️❤️
i keep coming back to this song, i listened to it 2 days ago, and i am back listening to it
this is more of a story than a song, i love it!
pure brilliance work of art, visual and sound
Insane..
... dieser "personenkult" nervt ganz allmählich. und wenn der einen pfurz lässt klatschen auch gleich alle !!! 👎👎👎
Another incredible piece. Genuinely masterful lyrics and video.
Sick Boi should win the Mercury Music Prize!
Fucking amazing couldn't have done it better ren love this
Comment
Unbelievably great, like always !
That's crazy
:0
foookin masterpiece
Damn
To be born welsh is to be born privileged, Not with a silver spoon in your mouth, But with music in your heart, And poetry in your soul.
This is astonishingly brilliant.
Waited so long for this one to come out and it was well worth it! Love your music and can't wait till you get huge!
I keep trying to get to enjoy your stuff because I have a massive appreciation for the immeasurable skill you have. Perfecting your craft for sure, but for some reason the way your voice sounds just doesn’t resonate with me and I don’t seem to be getting used to it with time. Don’t think I can ever truly be a fan like those in your fanbase but I really think what you do is amazing nonetheless! Keep it up man you’re doing so much for the people who are true fans
Mind blowing. If you'll excuse the pun....
My 6 year old pre verbal son spoke your lyrics, not common occurrence, he likes the singing man apparently (yeah I'm a bad dad for listening to rap, an expression of the truth) such wisdom Ren beyond your years, clearly you can reach people too.
Goosebumps all over 🩵
LOL Gen X version of "Cats in the Cradle"
Brillient simple perfect sir
amazing, putting a comment for the algorithm
OMG. That really makes me think. A masterpiece!!!
Long awaited!
Congrats !! You are redefining theatre,  composition and music. It's an excellent platform for your creative outlet !!
Awosome WOw
Amazing!!!!
firee
👏👏
Going to hit the 1 million views very soon. 🎉
Just WOW
OH MY GOD this is pure genius
Keep up the good work, loving all these songs! 🍻✌️
deep and comforting words, but shallow in its resolutions. These issues can't be erased, because those that thrive off of chaos and misfortune remain at the top, and those who skulk at the bottom trying to make the world burn, will never allow themselves to be at peace. But I don't blame the resolutions being vague, because you can't make everyone happy, you can't save everyone. But a hero will always try in vain for they must.
The most cringe video i've ever witnessed
Fantastic! You continue to impress me with your talents and your wisdom. An old soul but raw with the pain of witnessing what humans have become in this sick twisted oppressive system.   Compassion, empathy, generosity, and charity are mocked as weak in this game. Sociopaths win at this game…being W/o a conscience or heart is a bonus in this game.  “Losers” are often the real winners in this sick game. Wealth and fame can destroy the best of us.
Just a Masterpiece
Wow 👌
Genius
Mind = blown 🤯👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻❤
I am speechless
I have that Beano book!
Hot damn I'm continuously impressed with your work mate
Oh fuq…he’s in the wheelchair….battle stations! 🃏❤️🏁🎭🍿🎯🍿🎯🍿🎯

Absolute gold this😊
So in Hi Ren "Eminem did it", "played on guitar! Plan B did it", but in MG3 has anyone else ever rapped over just piano before?
part 3 of goosebumps ! thanks ren!
Love the intro.  .  . This I can tell is going to be good already.
Fantastic musician and a true artist. 😮
Wallenberg! Why is so hard to look in Wallenberg?
Genius on music🎉
Anything I say will be repetitive but I have to try. So I’ll just say thanks for sharing your art and inspiring us in so many ways. For me personally you’ve reignited my love for all forms of music. I kind of got “lost” for awhile and feel like I’m reconnecting with the things that really bring me joy. What a gift…
georgeus
Thank you for your voice of concern
Nothing else to say other than, yet another masterpiece, from the genius that is Ren ❤
Amazing art thanks Ren! 🙏
I love Ren. Thank you for Chinchilla btw. 😍
What the hell🔥
Absolutely stunning
This is a damn masterpiece!!!
He’s a lyrical genius everything he says, is truth n facts
Ren you've reached the next level........ Prophet........Good game. ❤
Thanks for the amazing video. I just want to let you know that the message you guys are sharing, is being heard, at least to me. Thank you, sincerely.
Masterpiece REN Congrats from ARGENTINA
Beautiful!!! Absolutley wonderful art. Man this guy is talented.
Brother this is a masterpiece congratulations to you and Sam ! I can not wait to see what’s in store  . Keep shining !
back to his best. Storytelling like the Tale of Jenny and Screech. What a unique talent.
🍋🍋🍋Lemons. I get it now. The fall of...  👍
Smashing it out the Water!
Ren. I think you just saved my life. This week I lost control,  I gambled away the little money I had. Because if its not 400k to pay my 62 year old dads mortgage.. It's not enough it seems.  But now I've lost the little money I have, I can't even begin to help him the way I want too. It was always going to happen. I'm self aware. But addicted. And im constantly dreaming of freeing my dad from this financial prison he lives in. So maybe he could at least live some years on this earth without that stress.  Listening to this makes me feel.. I want to stop being so focused on trying to pay the mortgage, or chasing that unicorn of financial freedom.  I just want to get up tomorrow. Go to work (my dad and I run a spray painting company just us 2) And make him proud. Laugh with him.. talk about shit. Enjoy that time to learn and be around him. Because all the money in the world can't pay for that time I get at work with my dad. Even if its hard sometimes.  I love you ren. And I love you all ❤ I won't let my addictions, or ANYTHING that this corrupt world throws at me break who I am. I will stamp my mark on the world just as you are. Big or small.   - Cha ❤
Took 3 years to explain what was wrong with humanity. In the end it was money.  What a masterpiece!!!!
Ren needs to headline the next James Bond soundtrack...dark, moody, brooding James Bond character soundtrack. Just sayin'
Amazing work
It is as if Ren, and Sam combined into a two-headed auteur, have single-handedly begun the unwinding of neo-liberalism, the ideology ushered in by way of Thatcher and Reagan, that fifty year counter-revolution against the New Deal and the British post WW2 Welfare State.   Enter the ideology of individualism, stage right, where greed is now just an invisible hand, stroking a now-sanctified marketplace, a rolling back of gains birthed in the bloody cauldrons of the union movement. Where once our grandparents empowered themsleves as check on the Dickensian mindset,,we now had, instead, as the sun set on the 1970's, the banishment of Britian's famed Keynes, and any idea that the collective will could guide economic production toward the collective.   All this, and many other forces from the blowback of colonialism to decades of foreign coups on behalf of first national, then trans-national, corporations, to the OPEC embargo, all combined to birth the waters into which we all now must swim.  These are the same waters that drowned, erased, phrases like "public good" in the flood pains and peats of history.  Those two leaders broke the backs of miners and public unions while simultaneously selling us on "Greed is Good." At the dawn of the 1980s,  we had all now drank the collective Kool-Aid of individualism. Generations were born into a world where the highest aim of public office became private gain.   Chasing the sugar-high of privatization, directing public funds and shaping public policy to subsidize the profits of corporations, we allowed our leaders, acting on behalf of international finance, the military industrial complex and Big Oil  (Big Ag, Big Pharm, Big etc..) to shape the headwaters of the river in which we all now must swim, the modern, neoliberal corporate welfare state. ,  These are the waters where we've internalized as immutable truth, the concept that redistributing wealth upward is "economic stimulus," where the  myth of meritocracy is dangled in front of every  ambitious child, and where  competiton is fetishized. Debt, desperation, and austerity for the many are seen, not just as fuel government provides to drive down wages, but as much needed aid to Finance and Real Estate interests.   That same debt, that same desperation, in the internalized ideology we all accept as truth, why that's character-building, that's market-driven motivation for children and young adults, entire families and countless congregations, character-building to extract blood as tax from even medical care, a tax to fill the money bag,  tribute to the princes and dukes of private equity, purveyors and chief beneficiaries of this, The money game.   Ren and Sam are tryimg to drive us hack from the brink, so  we can re-invent the wheel of collective will, modernize it, liberate technology from the oligarchs, monopolists and war profiteers, channel it instead into helping us solve all the problems that "greed is good" has wrought and fossil fuels have poisoned.   Well, thats my take on MG3, for whatever fuck its worth
Ren and nothin more <3
this music video reminds me of this america
Masterclass artist. More than just a singer I mean a ARTIST. If you know what I mean Than you know. If not hopefully you will one day!
As somebody has seen a lot of traditional success and seen the kind of people you deal with the higher you get.. i have seen more happiness in very poor people in south East Asia and south America. Everybody should reassess your values as you cannot buy happiness. Family and friends are more important than the latest thing, Michelin star restaurants and cool labels. They buy you a fleeting dopamine hit and then you are empty again.
they dont make art like this anymore. i hope you will keep this up forever ren, truly. When you have thousands of fans, im one of them; and even when you have only one fan, im sure thats me❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Another algorithm comment... Enjoyed it so much! Genius music video 👏
New manifesto just dropped
Amazingly greats!
man... i love it
Pride has a lot to do with it, if his Dad had have said, I’m proud of you son, instead of what he did he would have had a different perspective on life
Pow pow Powerful.
Wow!  Thrilled to see this creation and Ren’s well-deserved success.
Just realised something: you kinda summarised MG3 in a couple of lines of MG1.  " [Money turns] a child into a killer, his finger on the trigger of a money game. Oh, rain, rain, rain, rain...".
JUST DROPPED A FIRE REACTION TO THIS! SHOUTOUT TO REN FOR DROPPING THE FIRE CONTENT.
Ren, I really love your music and the messages you put out through your music. You are probably a really great guy. However, did I see the price for your Sick Boi album is $95 USD? Really? I'm disabled and live on benefits. Where in the world would I get that kind of money to purchase that album because I really really want it. I guess I can sacrifice a week of groceries. Or maybe I can forgo one of the meds that keep me alive this month. 😢 I'm so saddened and disappointed by the cost of the album. It's like part of the money game, isn't it? I can not participate in the money game. My disabilities make that happening very unprobable. I have Schizophrenia and recently discovered I've got these crazy white matter lesions scattered all through my left frontal lobe, causing many things but mostly dementia and I'm losing the use of my arms and legs. You who can participate in the money game, well cheers to you. I do realize how much time, effort, money, and genius went into your album. I'm sure it's worth more than what you're charging for it. Just know that it's cost cuts off people like me from enjoying your album and from contributing to your cause. No, I'm not asking for a handout. I've never asked for help from anyone. I've never used welfare or foodstamps. Housing assistance. Despite the Doctors telling my parents that I'd never be able to work or live on my own, I defied them. I held down two full careers for 20 years before I finally had to apply for disability. That wasn't taking a hand out. I paid into social security the entire time I worked. That money is my money. My savings to use.  I also raised two children. Put them through college. They are now very successful playing in the money game. Unfortunately Neither one of my kids listened to my teaching lectures that money means nothing. It's all about taking care of each other as human beings. They went to the dark side with their father. A rich corporate man. President of his department, sales. The kids now in their late 30's still think they aren't working hard enough because they don't have a billion dollars in savings. Come on. My daughter just bought my granddaughter a brand new Toyota SUV just as a gift. No special occasion. I'm just saying how it is. I don't want a free album. I don't have credit cards to charge it on. I can't pay the money back if I borrowed, so I chose not to get credit cards or loans. Do you offer a low interest payment plan with a flexible time frame for payments? I refuse to ask my kids for anything.
I do not need to point out to other Ren fans how beautiful and poignant this cautionary tale is. I just want to make my opinion known to the algorithm. Some people point to any one of several political figures this reminds them of. However, when I hear the line, 'If you manipulate the data, then the lie will sell itself,' it makes me think of Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos: fantastic job, Ren and all those involved with the creation of this masterpiece.  Bravo!
Unbelievable masterpiece. Oh god I wish the while world would hear this. Brilliance.
Wow...
Love from Germany to you Ren. We were just sitting in front of the screen, eagerly awaiting you newest Masterpiece. Oh Boy, this one is hard to swallow. Well done!
Absolutely  beautiful
ren
You have a gained a new mega fan!!
🔥 pure fire... that whole continuous shot. The bars. The message. Delivery. Visuals. Ren will change the world. Prove me wrong, I'll wait..............
Omthe most amazing piece of art that Ive seen in years. Congrats
Top one yet Love how yo can relate "us" as this story to everyone  Love that you take your inner living to the next level
dope
Wowowowowowowowow😂
Musncian and artist of the year Words so relevant Love you always My drug if choice
Theatrical masterpiece ren you are the man
Outrageously good. I have never seen a real masterpiece as good and at the same time deeps as this!
I instantly fell in love with this music 😍
Well this question have been asked So many times And answers May vary. But nice reminder.
All the best, Ren. You are the best!
So good
Superb ...
Outstanding, the voices of truth are ringing louder in this world, it is our duty to amplify those voices by amplifying our own, we are imprisoned in our minds due to the exploitation of our minds, when your enslaved by lies then it truly is only truth that can set you free, we will be free.
more than music, its art.
Nice work - as art - interesting perspective
Tremendous. Masterclass work. This one’s a keeper.
This reminded me of Marčelo - JBG Not in the content, but both are great at storiteling. JBG is from second person.
Thomas Shelby if he made music 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Great performance, great production.
The production quality matches Ren's performance, it's such an incredible piece to watch and listen to and think about.
A true masterpiece. Thank you so much.
I'm speechless. Incredible. Just clicked on a video with a dude in his wheelchair as the thumbnail. Now I need to go find part 1 and 2. 😊
A true artist
It all clicks in the end.  Bro, you're a bloody genius.  I know comments are tough ground, but I can't say enough how important your work is.  Music for me is in a "post Ren" world.  So many tunes and artists I thought were brilliant until I heard what brilliant actually is.    Total respect.  I 100% wish you the best in everything.
👏👏
G’day Ren,you won’t remember me I’m an Australian disabled veteran,you answered my comment on Suicide awhile back which I appreciated greatly. This is probably not the place for this but I have no other way of reaching out. I’m currently watching Anthony Ray’s second reaction ,this one to you and not a song (song isn’t really a strong enough word for what you do). I never understood until just now that when you talk about pain that you were talking about actual physical pain and I thought I’d let you know how much I understand what extreme chronic pain is and just how hard it is to live. (I dont live exactly I just survive each day). I also live with extreme chronic pain every second of every single f**king day. I just wanted you to know that your definitely not alone there are others that truly understand you, and now I understand a little bit more about your music. Keep it up mate you are definitely building a legacy that will live on long past the time when we’re gone. Thank you.
Got to totally agree with Knox This is a MASTERPICE!!! Never heard anything so real like this. This is the world we live in where money, power comes before life and humanity. Ren your a Poet of the Masses! Love this!
I once commented on one of Rens videos and called him a modern times bard. After money game pt3 I have to say…I was right. The art of storytelling and transmitting raw emotions through his voice and gestures is exceptional. Love this guy and his music.
DAMN! I MEAN DAAAAMN! This is fantastic, the music, the text, the video, everything is so well done and the combination of all this things really can touch the soul of a man. This reality we created makes people suffer, but u didn't talk about our today as there is no alternative, we can still create an Utopia, we just need to desire such things together, hope is not yet dead. We can make something good, such a beautiful message taken from a brute reality that is consuming the humanity of lots of people. Well done! (sorry for my bad English, still struggling with spelling and other stuff)
Wow Everytime you drop it's gold. Boy you don't miss ever
They made money their God... 🤮
masterpiece
damn
Liking all the comments here to PUMP this up!!
So heres my interpretation. Jimmy isn't dead. I might be looking too much at the fact both Hi Ren and Money Game Pt 3 are exactly 9 mins 20 secs. It's a little parallel I see to the idea this is all in Jimmy's mind. Hi Ren was a battle of the conscience and so is this. I see this song ending in 2 ways:  - Jimmy is dead. The story was all about his reality with no metaphor. I'm kinda not on board with this version.   - Jimmy isn't dead. Money Game Pt 1 had the line "Point the mirror at ourselves". The whole song is Jimmy's inner narrator reflecting back on his life. This starts with him removing the bag from his head to look at his reflection in the mirror. He is remembering how he got to where he is at the moment this song is happening.  In the process of revisiting these key moments in his life he is becoming more conscious to the idea that his life has not been in his own control. He's been a slave to the money game as much as anyone. So this hangar with all these memories he is walking through is the inside of his brain. This is him coming to the realisation that this is a person he doesn't want to be anymore. So when it comes to pulling the trigger on that gun, he isn't pulling it in the physical world. He's pulling the trigger on this old version of him. It's his moment of awakening to end that life and become a new and better person. A person who doesn't allow his life to be dictated by all of these sins he's been living up to that point.  It could even be that Jimmy didn't live this life at all. It could be that he is still young and this is all a point of making a decision in his life. The whole story could be him weighing up what path he wants to take in life. When he pulls the trigger, that is him making the decision that he doesn't feel that particular journey is worth it based on the anxious thoughts of destruction that he sees in his possible future on that path. So he's killing off that version of himself but not actually killing his real self. Whether he makes the right choice is up to the listener to decide at the end.
Superb
This whole video is just art like it was made and done so perfect
I prefer when he sings because he has a great voice ..
😳😳🤯🤯 wow.. he a prodigy...
Brabo
so true. so good
This music is a Canon event
This is not just a music.. this is art🔥
Masterpiece....
Ok. Almost a million already🔥
Absolutely incredible
Always bringing it with the important messages.  More people need to be openly brutally honest the way you are.
This is absolutely magnificent!
Ren -- Just wow.  The introspection that this brutally accurate message caused...   All I can say is thank you, truly and deeply.
Out The box
I have no words to tell how incredible it is. Thank you so very much.
Nice
Its already been 2 days, i hope by day 3 this reaches 1 million views.  for algorithm
Saving this to my masterpieces playlist
Very well done! I wonder where the guitar part from thumbnail have been
Ren... you're a proper genius with your finger on the pulse of the what's rotten about this world 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Respect & Peace ☘
You’ve done it again, REN.  How do you do it??  A man 100% in tune with his divine gifts.
F for the algorithm
This is art
just wow
Thank you.
" _If you manipulate the data the lie will sell itself_ " This is art, This is Masterpiece, Hands down the best thing I've watched after a long time❤❤
I can’t tell you what I just watched… but I fucking loved it.
I dont know do i love it or hate it, art its many times like  that i guess ? It has a god story but its so depressing. Sometimes life is and still we all got meaning ? i have thought so...
So much YES.
Absolute masterpiece!
Definitely a masterpiece unlike anything I’ve witnessed in my 50 years on this planet!
Amazing job all around.
Ren your creativity in music videos is unsurpassed  ❤
How is it possible that you keep outdoing yourself? Amazing work, just stunning.
That was revolutionary.
yeah Ren, you're the one, a super(bright)Star on the firmament
Fucking G.O.A.T, absolute pure poetry
absolutely stunning. Ren has a pocket no one else can fit in.
...ausser gewöhnlich...
Speechless ❤❤❤
Please share this everywhere so that YouTube can't bury it.  The message is too important.
ART
His 4th tale... brilliant!  Listening to MG1 & 2 with Jimmy's tale in mind is a different experience!
Again... you got me shedding tears after presenting the world with some of the rawest talent ever gifted to humanity. You're a different breed. Truly enlightened and awake.
Theatre !!!!!!!!! Love from Brighton Ren
Wow, wow, wow.
I can't believe I haven't commented on this one yet, but to be honest, it has lead me to be at least _somewhat_ speechless.  The theatricality, the suit, the piano, the smoke bomb, the gun, the quartet. It's a fucking masterclass in 'how to create a poignant and effective music video'.  Well done, dude. Though, I'd be interested to know how much you watched stuff like In The Thick of It back in the day lol
OMFG this was a hell of a ride. Love you Ren
thanks,ren,thanks for your life lesson from this music,you totally change my life, and i also share this music to my Chinese friend,save their soul and life
This left me speechless. ❤️ much love to you Ren your a genius and talented to the bone. Every cell in my body is hooked to every word your soul sings
Beautiful. Thank you!
We Need More Artists like Ren. This is Art. A masterpiece. Thank you Ren and keep going. The World needs more like this
This is Art. Really great Art.
So you’re teaching kids to kill themselfs at the end unreal this song should be band
yet another masterpiece from Ren, he keeps bringing it!!
*This Kid is DEEP!!*
Powerful
Can’t stop watching this, absolutely incredible even this is you at your best! Bringing me to tears every single time ❤
J’adore j’adore
Love, love, love. All you need is Ren. Thank you so much! (And this is a comment for the algorithm 😉 )
So good, thanks for you music) btw you look like Cillian Murphy haha hihi ;^)
Brilliant!
A Masterpiece.
man, this is crazy
Captivating
the only thing that I can't uderstand, why would you load more than one bullet in a gun, if you want to shoot yourself. It's quite difficult to miss the target from such close distance.
Hi ren...Love(your)music, The Money games!!! (your) sick boi... Hold on (to the) power (and) the hunger...(until) everybody drops...Life IS funny...Murderer!!! 😂😂 It's alright... (Now get) down on the beat...(you make it sound so sweet.) Dear God (stay) humble (You'll always be the) illest of OUR time !!!
I love Rens story telling its rare you ever see an artist put such passion into their work I would love to this artist and all they work with get the recension they deserve
First classical music rapper :)
cant wait for the luigi edits
he looks like Tommy Shelby here
It is so rare to find true poets whose work inspires internal reflection that is this relevant to the current human condition. Fantastic work Ren, thank you for sharing your art!
My favorite and most real money yet💥
That was profoundly unsettling, in the best possible way❤  You've got a special kinda gift bro, thanks for sharing it with the world.
Sounds like Hunter Biden
This is just na masterpiece. Love it!!
Bob Marley, Aurora, Tem, love you
I'm so glad that this masterpiece hits the nerve of so many,  being on yt trend #8 and achieving the million views  asap... this is unique & fire 🔥 inspiring without preaching...
He's not making just "songs". He's telling a story and i LOVE it!
❤️
damn, Ren.
this absolutly one of the best kind of art i've ever seen, i'm so impressed to your capacity of get the reality and commute it in art
Kaching
godlike
The intro sounds a bit like a Bond movie intro song. :)
Man your gold brother as real as one gets
This is what music is about.
Thank you
Ren is the Picasso of lyrical flow. Ren, please write a full musical, your words leave us on the edge of our seats waiting for what comes next, from Hi Ren to The Tale of Jenny and Screech, Suicide, Chalk Outlined and no Money Game 3.  Genius writing and a Legendary performance. I worked my whole life chasing the Jones’s always leading in the coolest shit, then at 48 I became a quadriplegic and losing everything. This cut deep but it was much needed
I love you.  Thank you
Is it just me or does the handshake reference Pink Floyd’s ‘Dark Side of the Moon’ record cover? (One businessman in flames …. a metaphor for being “burnt” by the music industry)?
I'm shook. Words can't define my feeling of this utter truth.
Sounds great
Yeah yr good blah blah.. but how about writing something prescient ,dealing with the dystopian world being crafted as you winge and wriggle and navel gaze. Covid was a con and the beginnings of a world you should be condemning. But you just reminisce and copy etc etc ad nauseam. Step up Ren!
Wow💫
Oh ren, oh ren, you played a song for me again! Well done, sir! You are a true artist...
The lyrics are captivating and told with such powerful emotions. The most impressive thing about this though, is the camera work. The silent MVP.
Authentic, Truth and Whole. So blessed to witness such a masterpiece and talent. Keep creating as this is pure bliss for the soul.
was not expecting a third money game but i'm Not Complaining
Every good thing will eventually have a sequel
Awesome vid!
Just an absolute work of art👏👏👏
This is a freakin' masterpiece, this and Hi Ren are my fav Ren songs
I like how this is more about the message not the beat. This is a serious matter!
I'm lost for words, another masterpiece!!
Guys an artist, saw the other ones but still took me like 5mins to make sure it wasn't Cillian Murphy
Who needs music industry validation? You join them , you join a cartel.   Lets buck the trend and back artists like Ren, there are many out there, just trying to swim upriver against the blandness that the industry swamps the market with.  Ren has shined the spotlight on a couple, but many more are out there.  Maybe not at the same level of Ren right now, but Ren started with nothing, busking on the streets, and just needed validation he was good enough.
Ren should not fill arenas but theaters and opera houses
YOU KILL IT EVERY SINGLE TIME    👏 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏beautiful mind heart and soul🥹🤍
Hy slenderman pianoing
Somehow i heard one of my fave muse songs for a second there.... best of both worlds❤
Yes, love this, it's a masterpiece. Incredibly relatable and well said.
Since the release I have been preoccupied with the reactions, come back to check and 900k views in 2 days. Way to go Ren 👊
This is how the world begins to applaud and assist its changes! 💖💖💖🫶🫶🫶🥳🥳🥳
Broo talking about Jimmy while looking like Tommy Shelby.
Stunning.
Thanks from Germany
This is my life, but not everybody gives up. I am very happy with little money right now, better than I was before.
Who's he singing about?
Awesome dude, pure genius ❤🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need.
Watch the new film, I think it’s called the Jones plantation. It really drives home the money game and the exploitation on one human being by another(s). Great work by the team of REN
🔥✨🎶✨🔥 A class act of an acting class system, and a genius genie of lyrical loop lipping. The hills are aflame with Ren! 🔥🎶✨🎶🔥
No comments XxXxX Masterpiece
[Verse 1] Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy 1 years old and his first words were "Mine, mine, gimme!" 2 years old he was walking, 3 years old walking quickly 4 years old he was running 'round the pavements of his city 5 years old and his daddy told him "Listen here, son You gotta learn to be a man, a man, he works for what he wants" 6 years old and he’s reading, writing, top of the bunch And when he's 7, his progression made him student number 1 8 years old and he’s praised for unusual grades 9, his parents pay for private school to nurturе the flame 10, 11, 12, 13, he ascеnds and ascends His daddy tells him "Son, money is the means to all ends" 14, solving complex mathematic equations At 15, IQ 150, still elevating 16, he develops complex software code That detects weaknesses in cyber security protocols 17, and he sells his vision keeping a share Not yet an adult, but he's practically a millionaire 18, and his daddy tells him "Now you're a man This world don't give a damn about you, so take all that you can" 19, he turns a profit stocks and shares invest in product 20, double-down deposits, 21, his income rockets 22, he learns that truth is just an obstacle to wealth If you manipulate the data, then a lie will sell itself 23, a life of luxury, crystal and cocaine 24, he makes the Forbes list, they're applauding his name 25, and his daddy tells him, "Listen here, son While you are sitting in your palace, that don't mean that you won" 26, a business shift, he switches business to arms He's 27, dealing nuclear and shells in Iran 28, inside the Senate money bought him a seat He's 29, a role of the council in the president, sweet Now he’s 30 and his daddy says "You're losing the race You're just a servant to the king, not even in second place" 31, a big maneuver for his daddy’s approval Moving imports over borders from the exports out of Cuba 32, moving grams, growing kilos to tonnes He's 33, filling warehouses with powder and guns 34, turf war with nobody to stop it Blind eye from the po-po inside of his pocket 35 and he gets a call, "I'm sorry son It's your father, had a heart attack, I'm sorry, he’s gone" 36, getting pissed up, abusing his product 37, eyes glazed, disposition demonic 38, with a prostitute, a moment of passion Heating up a silver spoon and then chasing the dragon 39, getting reckless and hungry for power Daddy’s words still driving him to kill and devour He makes a move against the cartel, but the strategy's flawed They retaliate and leave him in a hospital ward A bullet buried in the vertebra and one in the leg The doctor sighs and says "I don’t think you’ll be walking again", fuck🔥🔥🔥🔥  Verse 2] Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy He was 40, and he cursed the words "Mine, mine, gimme" 41, he wasn’t walking, 42, not walking quickly 43, never running 'round the pavements of his city 44 inside his palace with a mountain of gold But those riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves Weighing heavy on his conscience is the value of gold A Lamborghini for a life, trading money for souls Jimmy followed the code inside the land of the free Put your hand inside the cookie jar, take more than you need And his example is exaggerated versions of me And it's a version of him, and it's a version of she And it's a version of you, there’s no escaping the blame The way we live is parasitic, fuck the money and fame! Cut the music!  Verse 3] This ain’t entertainment, this is real-life The way we live is lunacy, community, it declines We're hyperpolarized, we're always fighting, and we divide Truth is less important than the money that we design? Money's an invention, politics from our invention They all come from peoples' ideas, did I mention? Borders? An invention, law, and order fuel the tension That leads to people killing each other. My solution? Everything is subject to change We could build utopias if individuals were taught to use their brains But if we teach kids in school to always be sheep And put ourselves before the herd if there's more money for me Then there’s no future I see, where the humans survive We're parasites inside a Petri dish with cannibal minds Mold will grow upon a surface, then consumes till it dies And our fate could be the same, so here's a story for the wise
I can’t express how i feel soo let it be like fill in the blank  ……..fill this gap like whatever you want damm i have been watching you for so long proud of you my brother from different mother
Brother can I borrow your brain and your throat flow of your music hits me like machine gun
Ren really produces some thought provoking videos
Wow
Wow

This is solely awesome!
Wow.  I love how you tell the stories, but truth ones! This is a masterpiece- your words, your voice your acting … and just also done in one room. So powerful!  Love it! Xx❤ Keep on teaching us Ren, we are listening 💗
Welcome to the real world , that's how it should be called this masterpiece.
Wahou 🤩😍 amazing and beautiful work
Ren is on a different level and I'm enjoying the view. He is a genius!
I have to say, even in the context of this masterful work, the heartbreaking visual of Ren pressing that gun to his head was almost more than I could bear. Stellar message, & I know I will never forget this piece of art. 💙✌
Amazing...
The filming in this is fucking incredible
Incredible story telling, acting, a musical genius❤ The way everyone worked together is just wow. Can't stop listening to it. Everyone needs to see this. Much love to you Ren✌️❤
Damn

Really love the piano and strings throughout this performance.
This isnt music, its art. Thank you
OH WOW did not expect that !!!!!
gg
Seeing how far you've come as Samuael and Ren, I've just gotta say WOW, this was a cinematic masterpiece that made drop everything
Impecable how you deliver your brilliant lyrcs!!! BRUTAL!!!
Just Simply Genius.
My dream was always that humanity would eventually advance far enough that every need was met and every mind flourished, so we may become gardeners to our planet and nurture it, building a literal paradise, where everyone wanted for naught and the highest aim was to have lived a full life in a world full of life.
Omg is this for real 2 days ago ❤️
God i know it was a prop but god damn my brain just wanted to scream for the lack of trigger discipline ethier ren another fucking master peice of art keep up the work man but dont push you self to hard fucking love your work man wouldnt want to rush anything
I'm conflicted, Ren has taught me not to be a 'follower' and 'sheep' but I can't stop clicking on everything he does and wishing he was our shepherd to lead us to the light! Oh irony why has thou forsaken me! Buy 'Sick Boi' it's great! 😁❤
O my fucking God...
Epic
this is not music. this is literal art.
You look like the wish version of Tommy Shelby
He looks like Thomas Shelby
Absolutely stunning as usual. All of the talent here is crazy between the music, the cinematography, all of it is outstanding
Lyrics:   [Verse 1] Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy 1 years old and his first words were "Mine, mine, gimme!" 2 years old he was walking, 3 years old walking quickly 4 years old he was running 'round the pavements of the city 5 years old and his daddy told him "Listen here, son You gotta learn to be a man, a man he works for what he wants" 6 years old and he’s reading, writing, top of the bunch And when he's 7, his progression made him student number 1 8 years old and he’s praised for unusual grades 9, his parents pay for privatе school to nurture the flame 10, 11, 12, 13, hе ascends and ascends His daddy tells him "Son, money is the means to all ends" 14, solving complex mathematic equations 15, IQ 150, still elevating 16, he develops complex software code That detects weaknesses in cyber security protocols 17, and he sells vision keeping a share Not yet an adult, but he's practically a millionaire 18, and his daddy tells him "Now you're a man This world don't give a damn about you, so take all that you can" 19, he turns a profit stocks and shares invest in product 20, double-down deposits, 21, his income rockets 22, he learns that truth is just an obstacle to wealth If you manipulate the data, then a lie will sell itself 23, a life of luxury crystal and cocaine 24, he makes the Forbes list, they're applauding his name 25, and his daddy tells him, "listen here son While you are sitting in your palace, that don't mean that you won" 26, a business shift he switches business to arms 27, dealing nuclear and shells in Iran 28, inside the Senate money bought him a seat 29, a role of the council in the president, sweet Now he’s 30 and his daddy says "You're losing the race You're just a servant to the king, not even in second place" 31, a big maneuver for his daddy’s approval Moving imports over borders from the exports out of Cuba 32, moving grams, growing kilos to tonnes He's 33, filling warehouses with powder and guns 34, turf war with nobody to stop it Blind eye from the po-po inside of his pocket 35 and he gets a call, "I'm sorry son It's your father, had a heart attack, I'm sorry, he’s gone" 36, getting pissed up, abusing his product 37, eyes glazed, disposition demonic 38 with a prostitute, a moment of passion Heating up a silver spoon and then chasing the dragon 39, getting reckless and hungry for power Daddy’s words still driving him to kill and devour He makes a move against the cartel, but the strategie's flawed They retaliate and leave him in a hospital ward A bullet buried in the vertebra and one in the leg The doctor sighs and says "I don’t think you’ll be walking again", fuck  [Verse 2] Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy He was 40, and he cursed the words "Mine, mine, gimme" 41, he wasn’t walking, 42, not walking quickly 43, never running 'round the pavement of his city 44 inside his palace with a mountain of gold But the riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves Weighing heavy on his conscience is the value of gold A Lamborghini for a life, trading money for souls Jimmy followed the code inside the land of the free Put your hand inside the cookie jar, take more than you need And his is example is exaggerated versions of me And it's a version of him, and it's a version of she And it's a version of you, there’s no escaping the blame The way we live is parasitic, fuck the money and fame!

Money's an invention, politics from our invention They all come from peoples ideas, did I mention? Borders? Our invention, law and order, fuel the tension That leads to people killing each other. My solution? Everything is subject to change We can build utopias if individuals are taught to use their brains But if we teach kids in school to always be sheep And put ourselves before the herd if there's more money for me Then there’s no future I see, where the humans survive We're parasites inside a Petri dish with cannibal minds Mold grows upon a surface, it consumes till it dies And our fate could be the same, so here's a story for the wise  [Outro] 45, Jimmy comes home out of the rain Soaking wet upon a wheelchair, drinking again He is everything he wants, he has fortune and fame He’s a fortunate fool with an unfortunate fate With a 45 caliber aimed at his brain 45 - a fitting number, 'cause his age is the same Hears the words of his father; "Such a damn shame" Then he presses on the trigger of a money game
Wow ! Another brilliant piece of art by Ren and Sam. Society is blessed to have them.
Oh. My. God. That ending sent shivers down my spine.  Your writing is insane and visceral and raw and I love that your performance matches it to a T.  Congratulations on what you're making, Ren!
Truly a masterpiece!
Brilliant, as usual 🤘
Algo go go
Thanks Ren, what you are bringing to music and art, is the best thing to come out of the UK music scene for a very long time, long may you reign. All the best for your health and well being. Love and Light.
Ren, you and your team are fantastic ❤
Amazing work. I wish the powerful lot listened to people.
are my son and myself the only fans in nz? havent heard the name ren here in nz ever,bards still exsist,proof!
🔥
Ren YOU ARE A KING!!!!!!!!!
I hate to be "That guy".... but Animals. Except the fact that I will gladly watch the torch get passed and herald in the message.
i rewatched the first 2, this is by far the best and definitely one of your best songs you've improved so much
Petition for a instrumental version
Always poetic and artful keep up the exceptional creations.
Absolute masterpiece!!
Sic
Masterpiece
As always - flawless
Ren you need to write about perspectives, reading & watching through 100's of your videos reviews it amazes me how many are far reaching 🤣
Please don’t change when ur super rich ur one of us 😊
verry good
I discovered Ren tonight at 12am. Its now 3:30 and im starting my "last" Ren song for the night.
The most interesting artist of our time.
Just awesome.
Thomas Shelby making masterpiece
Finally, I get to learn how economic ends in the thrilling series finale!
Black is white and white is black, but it's all about rebellion when you're young, and you never really listened to your parents! It's about tearing it all down! Those People that were always shouting, who are older, have lived your issues, and do it out of love because the already know! So sad that the disconnect comes across so harshly. or you only remember what you remember.  but because you as a child never lived any temperance nor will your child either if you live that long!
greed. human problem no. 1
Much love brother
Ren, you're set to do great things sir. Incredible!
Only for the algorithm, because i just cant say anything about this masterpiece or have words that will not sound like an absolutely euphemism. Extraordinary work Ren.
Bro this is a transcendetnal peice!
As always, REN, your a lyrically inspired, musically gifted, and a  verbal virtuoso!   Keep it up. Keep bringing us these bombs, and keep blowing us away with them bro!  Mad respect and admiration of you and your abilities!
Dope.
Counter attack  on  the shit people live inside in believe of happiness .  High   price creation .
U have to be 35 to run for president
Wow!
Dude. This is incredible. I have tears in my eyes at how amazing it is.   Protect, Empower & mend the divide.
Love your music so so so much has made me weep and die inside - so why did this feel like parody?   Every emotional point feels like it was hit in another song. Every beat. Every ‘uh’ moment.   It’s like you recognized what struck in the songs and tried to remake it. Nah man. What made your tubes rad was the opposite. All new.  Hope it’s a blip. Keep being rad man. No disrespect
What an artist!
Splendid!
Masterpiece, genius, bard, God, there are so many words but non of them hyped enough to be honest. I LOVE YOUR WORK. I love your mind. I love your heart. I love your soul.... But I definitely don't like you in a suit and red tie. Nope don't like it. 👀 Who am I kidding, I like that too. 🥵
Is YT shadow banning Ren? I see that he is only at 1.1 million subs right now. There is no way in hell that a man with his amount of talent is only at that many subs. Why do the elites hate independents a free thinkers so much...oh wait, never mind stupid question.   Keep up with the good work Ren! You and your talents are greatly appreciated. I share every new video of yours with all of my family and friends. Even my 75 year old mum, who loves your work as well. Take care!!
Damn!!!
Last night I had a dream that ren and scroobius pip had beef and released the most epic diss tracks ever heard
Throughly enjoyed that!
Goosebumps
I'm in aww every single time Ren releases a new track. It's like "but wait folks there's soon much more" let's go Brother Ren.
This is fire!
solid art
Balele
OH damn, son. For the love, Ren , this shit is way too beautiful! Serial goosebumps, reality and truth. Needs to reach every household and every home. Get the fuck out and celebrate. There's a little left before the .45 hits your head.
Fucking brilliant! Powerful!
Again, with the message of common sense, disguised as entertainment to get people to watch it.  It cuts through the fluff to the root of the problem.  I guess the obvious thing to do is create a musical.  The talent is there.  The words are there.  The money is on its way.  Please do something with this, so more people can stop and realize what's going on.
Perfect Budd!!!👍👍👍
Ofcourse I'm hooked.
What i think is very special about Rens music is, that with the long songs you'd never think that these are 9mins. It feels much shorter. And with the very short ones, the opposite is the case. Bittersweet Symphony Retake for example feels much longer than 2:40. I dont know how he does this.
This was so powerful...
it gives the chills. Amazingly done.
Underrated
One of the best new artist of our generation.
Refreshing
I... need to process this. 1 and 2 impressed me, but this... this is... I'll sleep on it and hopefully wake up with some better perspective.
Holy. God. This is one of the greatest pieces of music I've ever heard. No, on the Internet. Wait hold on no. This ain't a rap song. It's the truth. The state of the brutal world we're living in, where the true escape is through our demise.  Hear that? That's true.
Genius 🇨🇦
I love your art, your music, your videos, your messages, everything. You deserve all the attention. ❤
This is awesome
Breathtakingly brilliant as always ❤
@ren yo man I am speechless, your such a dope ass storyteller man, you are one of my top 10 favorite artists, I just turned 44 last month and you have an old soul you rap and story tell like your my age man, keep up the great work my brutha, mad love and huge respect from xPyrOxSiKx from San Bernardino California The Big IE
Genius 💐
GENIUS!!! No other words… It’s like watching a theatre peace. That’s just beautiful. Masterpiece
I'm stuned...almost speechless, and I bow down in respect and appreciation for this marvelous masterpiece I just witnessed. Thank you.
why would a millionaire on forbes choose to sell drugs? 🤣
Sickest music video ive seen in a while
Must be shared. Must change the game!
This was worth the wait. Epic.
I just wish the masses would actually believe this.
Como siempre… impresionante. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I hope that more talented people start relying on their talent like Ren so we can reinvigorate society with good, emotion filled, & positive music.
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Spitting truth..
Wow, that was nine minutes?  I was wrapped the whole time.
Looks like Tommy Shelby
You should do a collaboration with Soweto Kinch!
Captivating storytelling, Ren!
there's genius written all over it.
Please just stop it !! This is getting ridiculous !! Proud of you Ren!!!
where is part 1 and 2?
This is Art, capital "A", this man never stops to impress. Always so true.
Wow I'm speechless 😶 Another Masterpiece
YES
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 Instant epic classic
Pretty dope! Bet that took some time to conceptualize and shoot! 👏🏼
I just shitted myself
amazing story telling!   Keep it up!!!
Wow! Perfect, genius.... Wow.... Excellent.... Thank you.
Я родился в Москве в семидесятом На краю города, моча рано ударила в голову В четыре активно ругался матом В детском саду девочки впервые показали мне пизду Потом школа, вонючая форма Драки, клей, так я становился сильней
my favourite one so far full of perfect story and music
How is this not on YouTube trending
Mind fuckin blown
Ren’s progression can somewhat be tracked by just the money game series alone. You can tell by how much of a masterpiece this song is that he’s come incredibly far.
Not the most popular artist of our time, but the most IMPORTANT, ESSENTIAL and TRUTHFUL artist of our time
Everything promised and more 💜
Another masterpiece 🏆 Thank you for the inspiration and for raising the bar so high
deep and dope, rhymes that flow and stick to the dome!  awesome beyond words Ren!
🤟🙏
Brilliant
when music and art and poetry coalesce -- GOLD!!
Oh the irony to sing about the evils of man and money, while having monetisation turned on.
Only discovered Ren about 2 months ago but no artist has ever caught me this quickly. More people need to see this 🔥
Thanks Ren, forget the shopping, the chores, going outside, even forget the kids! Am devouring this over and over, not just musically but artistically, the imagery, cinematography, the visual landscapes, all conjuring up my love of music and film, but also this thing called life. You are changing everything my friend and are so far ahead of the game. I’m still trying to process all that you are about, it’s huge what’s going on right now with you. Give me 5 and I’ll be back watching again, damn.
Probably said a lot. But I need the composes musical.
Wow. So fuckin amazing
holy shit
Shakespeare meets Eminem. This this masterpiece needs to be everywhere!
Damn... Just... DAMN!
I wasted moment of my life here with this dumb shhhhh wtf lmao
This is art. Best thing about 2023, for me, was discovering Ren. Video of the year, album of the year, artist of the year. No question.
Brilliant
Oh this is an EVENT!!!
Again, Ren is an artist with real messages... listen
So when are we getting our spooky scary Ren the Musical? Clearly hes got the cinematic, theatrical, and musical down pat; he just needs to learn how to incorporate jazz hands or smthing and we are set to go.
Just Fantastic,  Time for Ren to Direct his first feature film.
W. O.W. Flipside of "Cat's in the Cradle." What a difference a lifetime makes.
That makes me cry. You are correct. You make us look at what we have become.
Dudee, this is amazing!!
👏❤‍🔥
This is art, this is a masterpiece stfu this is nothing compared to the true art and masterpieces in music!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Looks like Cillian Murphy
Awesome and so so Ren.
Anybody else get the vibe rens version of the joker would be too spot on, but better than heath ledger? Making jared lettos joker see what it was suppose too be vibes?
Your songs are  music, theatre, poetry, philosophy, and humanity in one. Brilliant doesn't even begin to explain your talent. Such respect.
Bro.
So damn good.
I just bought sick boi cd and digital copy. I'll get the vinyls next week. I can't and don't normally support people this much but you're the guy. If and when I can ill support your exploits.
Now the wait for part 4 starts.
This album is so sick. Gonna make history for sure. Surely one of the sicket album of all time. I'm musicaly shaken by all rhis creativity in rhe name of greatness. Every single person on earth should take 1h  and more to listen and understand the message beyond that. The journey is so powerfull on so many levels. Best album in yeaaaaaars. Prove me wrong.😂
Feel stupid.   Is there a part 1 and a part 2?
Sounds like the Requiem for our species. Turns out the nature called us out to wipe out the table after the sixth party. 😅
Visionary .... Just WOW.
The only reason this isn't at 1 million yet is because Tik Tok ruined people's attention spans
❤ another gem. Sheesh. I adore your music. Straight raw and from the heart. So much talent.
Absolute fire
I think we all need to be incredibly happy that Ren has chosen to use his power for good. This is a masterpeice
Shits about to go Viral. LOL
Similar to the way the opening verse and the verse where it speaks about Jimmy's first words and walking...The entire money game trilogy comes full circle in this song. "Rain, rain, rain, rain...A storm it comes our way. And those who rise through distorted lies, poison in their veins," The chorus from the original Money Game 1 and 2...It comes full circle with the ending of the story where Jimmy comes in soaking wet from being in the rain. And he has his finger on the trigger of a money game, but this time, the gun is aimed at himself, not at the others that he wanted to profit off. Money does not equal happiness. You can only find that from within yourself through love, patience, and respect for yourself and others. I think it's pretty clear that this is the message here. Chasing wealth and fame over everything and everyone will not only NOT bring you joy, it will destroy you. It will eat you from the inside out. Like mold growing on the surface of a petri dish, people chasing wealth will consume, consume, consume, but eventually they will die with a broken heart and a rotten soul.  Ren...you are an inspiration and an incredibly talented, intelligent and gifted artist. Keep killing it!
Dame legend 🔥 ….. always wonders
Utopia is a nice idea. Too bad the literal translation from Ancient Greek is "no place". Balance; if the string is too loose it will not play, too tight and it will snap.
Really weird guy. What a genius though.
Just going to say it. Peaky Blinders. Not hating; I'm going for the same look.
Epic performance and brilliant writing as always Ren. Powerful content and as usual, raising the bar  with food for thought! 🔥👊🧡👍🔥
Holy shit man…some of these lines just ripped thru the heart. Not to forget the body language , the camera, the aesthetic. Riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves. Beautiful and sad.
what kind of haircut dose he got
OMG this is like the music video to Funeral for a friend - Juneau Acoustic. Suits with the rag and ties, if that was your inspiration thats amazing!
I didn’t have words after watching this. It’s an absolute masterpiece. Music hasn’t moved me and touched me like this in years before I heard Hi Ren and then this, just left me speechless. You’re an absolute gem Ren, please don’t ever stop being you ❤
Fucking hell, mate. 🔥
big boy
💯🔥 🔥
keep on.
Brilliant Music Video!  Beautiful cinematography from Sam and team.   On my first watch, i was saddened by the dark ending...but, after multiple views, i get your message, Ren.   I try my best to being light into this dark world, but theres always room for improvement! Peace and love to all ❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wowww, new subscriber here after I've been noticing people reacting to "Hi Ren", you are a lyrical genius 😮 your messages are all hitting me deep, thank you!
What does everyone else think it means that the shot didn't fire, it just clicked as 'he presses on the trigger of a Money Game"
Part 1 is probably my 2nd favorite video of all time.  Part 2 was a letdown in comparison (no offense I 💚 Ren).  This is a killer follow up though!  Really well done!!!!!
If ever a song was a painting... this would be a Van Gogh!  What a blessing to have such an amazing crew to help bring your creative visions to life! Congratulations to everyone involved in the making of this masterpiece!   You have officially broken the fourth wall! ❤
Incredible
Love me a good REN song! Always so diverse and fresh
I thought you could not top Hi Ren, but I think you just did. This is exceptional. I dont have superlatives to give you enough credit. Taking Rap, Peotry and Theatre to a whole new level at the same time, wow!!
MASTERPIECE... Ren, I thank you for existing. Art, pure Art.
Transcendent..
Amazing composition. Great work Ren & team.
"Then he presses on the trigger of the money game"  That hit ... differently
yo this is good
That filming is amazing
Damn.
Incredible ❤🎉
3:25 be fire though🔥🔥🔥
Jeezus this is jeenius
Damn Jimmy, you just had to sell sea shells.
Awesome song, getting "chocolate rain" vibes from the piano intro lmao
Aahhh awesome
Need the sheet music for the piano!!!! 🎹
Algorithm needs to push this out there!
For the algorithm :]
🪐
Brilliant
Brilliant and too true
Fantastic piece of work ....May your poetic and artistic talents keep gaining attention!
Ren for the next James Bond theme... Imagine it!
Incredible! Phenomenal story telling! Very moving too.
Next level!
Brilliant, as always 🔥
Ren….. you’re in your own lane now.
So handsome btw
👏👏👏👏👏 damn dude..❤
I can't stop watching this,  every part of it is masterful ❤
Art
The fastest 9 mins ever. Great work and message as always
Daaaaaaamn!  This man is a genius.
Words cannot explain. Plaudits are insufficient. Accolades worthless. Renegade, poet, bardcore, Artist all mashed into The Enigma that is = Ren
beautiful.

🤘❤️‍🔥
Holy crap. Masterpiece
Suicidal garbage from the company.
oh shit oh shit hell eyah was not expecting a part 3
I missed release day but I love thisss
I have watched this multiple times now, and still get chills.  Amazing piece of art.
You are a true artist.
You are a gift to humanity. Thank you Ren for so brilliantly and creatively speaking truth. May more people listen. Learn. And make different choices.
I mean this with no malicious intent, but genuinely... Change is needed...  But when the whole system is one massive gun, and not playing the money game means you are an enemy of that gun...  How are you suppose to change? How do you change an entire system of economics?
wait that was 9 minutes? jesus christ, also that ending was amazing
Gotta love the inter-musicality (within his own catalogue) he keeps on displaying: The first lick he sings =~ the beginning of Violets Tale  :bow
🔥
I will just jump on the wave and call this art. But it truly is. Some people look at great painting, or old sculptures. But to me, this is true art.
Poetry dive… let’s go!!
“He’s 33 filling warehouses with powder and guns” was this on purpose because you’re 33 in a warehouse with powder and guns? Just wondering because that’s so clever!
Exquisite!!!!! Keep shining your light Ren!!!!!
This one is going places.
Just spend too much to going to the cinema. The movie did not really click with me. What was it about, shit i cant even tell. Another product for the masses being slighty entertained, at least enough to forgot the problems causing through my veins. Feeling kinda empty like the street is kinda empty as im walking in the night. Finally hit my door the same door as so many met before which locks and hides the dead silence of the many floors. Just a quick second, just a little while back i turned on my depression machine, hoping for some slowed down thinking and maybe hiding in a game. Open youtube just for the hell of it - endorsed shit stained content "remember to hit the bell of it". But then to my most pleasant surprise, among all the trash in the flashing content wall a new video from Ren, i guess this dark evening is saved after all. Loved it man thanks for being real.
Raw Art.
Brilliant
Bro is the result of Tom MacDonald and Eminem
🎧🇧🇷😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Did you solve that Rubik’s Cube in 15 moves?
Holy crap bro this is crazy
This man needs to be funded and enabled to produce whatever comes into his mind
yeah boiiii
There isn't anyone else at Ren's level! AMAZING music, story, camerawork...
ren IS genius
👏👏👏
Speechless.
Wow.
Fucking brilliant!
last 2 albums I bought was slim shadey and chilly peppers (blood sugar...) and now sick boi at numero uno cos ren knows his judo

Poetry.
Capitalism is a disease. A viral plague on this planet that’s been falsely elevated as the solution. When greed is the root of a system, malice will be the only outcome.
😮wow😮
You've done it again.🔥
asombroso
Genius!
More BRILLIANTLY PERFORMED ART CONGRATS  REN AMAZING AS PER USUAL WE ARE HERE TO SUPPORT YOU BROTHER U R THE REAL DEAL ❤TALENT LIKE NO OTHER ‼️💯
Great work. So consistent
Peaky fuckin' Blinders 😁 my first association

Just bought the album - never been so excited in my life!!
to the all seeing eye! hail illuminatis gratis!
I wish I was even a quarter as talented and creative as Ren. Another masterpiece!
Liebste Grüße aus Deutschland.... 🤟💫💜
Beautiful song man, big fan from Argentina here! Cheers
What a soliloquy
Wow
👌🏼 Stunning piece of work x
Pure art
Geeezus. I mean fucking WOW. Amazing work.
Bump. This hits hard!!!!!!
G.O.A.T
Ça c'est de l'Art avec un A majuscule.
Amazing.  My word.
This man needs to write a film
Ren, hello from a 30 minute drive from the belly of the beast, Washington DC. You're incredible my friend. Just incredible. Your message resonates because you speak truth to power in your music. Never stop my friend.
I like how he thinks of the song as more than a song; the video and music is a totality, a piece of art.
How did you figure it all out? Brilliant!
How do I keep forgetting what a talented musician and vocalist Ren is?!? I get so wrapped up in the lyrics...
Wow
Good job
Honestly a masterpiece, don't have any other words for describe it, no other than pure perfection
Every single element of this is just ART huge well done to him and his team
Mg3= what would happen if hi ren and Jenny, screeches tale had a baby
Absolute art
Heavy.
Creatively speaking you are the Prince of our generation
Amazing storytelling as usual. I was a bit nervous, but so glad I love it.
The Lovers Painting by René Magritte
amazing
🤯
Yet again generating thought. Brilliant.
Needs more exposure!
I'm 62 years old and I get as excited at the news that Ren has brought out a new track as I did years ago when I used to go and see the likes of  Deep Purple and The Who. Love this kid, so talented.  Hope success doesn't change him from the nice lad he comes across as.
No this is just beautiful HS this gave me chills
Fucking hell man. Bravo.
Bravo Ren told it as it is! Masterpiece again, this world needs you, love this so much hits like a hammer , artistic genius ♥️ ❤❤
so the thing that goes deeper than politics and party is ideology and dogma. many countries have some version of a left and a right wing and what they distill down to in their essence is utilitarianism vs individualism. I've studied and thought a lot about the concepts Ren talks about this song and I believe solution only comes from a broad and widely adopted shift in ideology towards a specific mix of both and they are this: when it comes to matters of money and power and well being we must be utilitarian. when it comes to matters of personal freedom we must lean towards individualism. I like this video but I felt like it did the easy job which is tell a story of a flaw in capitalism, however it missed on any type of call to action. so I thought id add my own. try looking at matters of money and power through a utilitarian worldview and see what happens.
Bro, just keep making music that resignates with people. Dont sell your soul. Its Gods will. This world needs you.
Absolute genius once again! You're such an amazing all-encompassing visual artist, your lyrics, your words, your bars and that cinematography are all phenomenal! Keep going, I'm looking forward to hearing, and seeing, what you do next 💪🥰
I love when I can watch a person's hands on the piano.
Masterpiece is right ! Sensational.  Xxx
Another masterpiece....
❤❤❤
"nah, too depressing for my taste" a friend said. So I kissed him on the cranium with an aluminum baseball bat. Got to get him in the ground before he starts to smell.
Real
The Best.  The Genius, The greatest . The next album is going to be even better!!!!!!
This is one of the best songs I've ever heard and easily the best music video I've ever seen. The top 100 is total garbage. This is such a breath of fresh air
Algorithm
You give me hope! Keep doing what you do. The community you have created is amazing. I’m 62 in the USA. I believe that out of the chaos we are experiencing will come solutions. Love the album ❤
Algorithm
This is a MASTERPIECE
Master piece
Wow, this was intense. Thank you Ren
My man ten proving again why he a godsend. Another absolute masterpiece
Awesome as always. Wow!
Thank you Ren and your amazing team, for this masterful piece of art. I agree that together we can solve it if we collaborate and quit competing. This community has helped give me a new faith in humanity and in my ability to participate in some collective movement that isn’t self destructive…or at least is trying to find a way not to be. Best of luck to us all!!
Another brilliant work of art, Ren! You and Samuel are simply killing it with these poignant lyrics wrapped up in world class videography.
When nothing but humans voices fill the world passive animals extinct in ignorance; and ignored societies death written prophecies morn and dispear years compound usage indulgence letting off life ever lived on earth
Musical slam poetry of truths.
wow 😮
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🧯
What an absolute masterpiece 🙏
This is why I love Ren he is a performer and lyrical genius. A true artist
someone get Waluigi to sing this one
Deep...😮😢
I NEED that piano sheet music. The whole thing is just beautiful but I absolutely must learn the piano part.
Leaving a comment for the algorithm
this is absolutely my fav ren video to date, like, its a MASTERPIECE of story telling, just, wow.
Awesome!
This not just a music video and a song, this is piece of ART.
Absolutely sick. What an all round talent you are and a font of genius application of said talent to unique and genre shattering music. Your latest material, more and more, crosses the line into theatrical performance and you truly are a gifted, multi-talented wonder of a human and an inspiration to anyone that listens.
Insane  and True, love it🔥🔥
knocking it out of the park once again. Cheers
damn. did it again, ren!
wow! CHILLS man!
Is anyone surprised, even a little about this being a masterpiece?  It's what Ren does.
If you're new here, welcome to the RENaissance!!!
❤
masterpiece of the year
33 and writes yet another brilliant song, I hope for the world he is not near done!
Great Lyricism
Al'G rythm
.

Incredible, its truly a work of art.
So, Part 4 will be 30 minutes :D Another masterpiece!
Wow. Just... wow.
Wow. Just wow. So excited for this album to arrive!
Beyond Genius for sure!!
Ren you are the most Iconic Artist of our time ! That is for sure! No other can touch the soul like you do! At least mine :) I can relate so much to your music but this song is like my life until my 25th year and if I did not make a bit different choices I am sure that I would of ended like you sang it till the end! You have access to the source for sure keep on sharing it all with us PLEASE NEVER STOP and stay true to yourself money and fame corrupt I know it from experience and you will have money and fame you never dreamed of pretty soon!!! Love you!!! Peace and Love to you !!!
The story that needed told.....
Ho Lee Fuckmesideways! ~ You nailed it @Ren ~ gaWd bless you mate! 😉💋😎🖤🔥🤘✌️🙏
This song is something else, but also the way Ren ties things together is subtle and amazing.  “Rain, rain, rain / A storm it comes our way” At the end, he’s out drenched in the rain.  “And those who rise through distorted lies.” We learn the story of Jimmy and his climb to power. And finally, what hits it home for me, “Poison in the veins” Later in life, Jimmy turns to drugs and alcohol, which linger in the bloodstream.  This is a work of lyrical/compositional art.
Ren you sir are a genius and also a legend! Of a man of 47 years old who has suffered from mental illness for years, i find your music and words so meaningful and so important especially the way that the world is now that it is so vital that everyone should be listening to what you have to say, sometimes when i listen to your songs i think you have been in my head and are singing my direct thoughts,  i hope you know what im trying to say,  i don't mean it from a dysfunctional way, all im trying to say is just keep on doing what you are doing, cause the world needs people like you, more than ever! Keep on shining and stay blessed!
Looks like an inferior copy of Hi Ren, all the old elements plus some stuff that was possibly, in my mind, inserted by his producer, especially the spilling liquor bit looks very very borrowed. Maybe he sold out after Hi Ren broke through. I think that Ren is a great artist and however his creative path is, he will prove to be more than a one day wonder, eventually. A lot of his older stuff from befor Hi Ren video is also pretty good, man is a poet.
People who get it get it! Just wow! Only discovered ren a few week back and i didnt really listen first time and when i did finally listen i was mind blown...just simply amazing!🫶👏
Makin movies out hereee
Ren is my life style
I ate an entire chicken thigh with salad while watching this video.
yaaaaaas
commenting for the algo. Keep going dude 🤟
That's what you call an artist.
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿👌🏻🍺
An actual masterpiece
Is this guy 25 or 50?
I’m speechless over this ren, fantastic art 🤌🏻🤌🏻🤌🏻
Top talent you guys r awesome thanks Ren!
The end gave me goosebumps
Good Job Ren
Let the truth be told!
write 3 songs about why corporations are bad and than make a yt video only for yt premium users. XDD
Wow, this is amazing. Thanks Ren! You really set new standards with every new song you release! Lovin it!
Dude...
Wonderful Ren, you have reached the heights of Hi Ren.  It reminds me of the original comment on Money Game spoken by Jesus, "For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul".
Very happy I watched this. I love that artists like you, Ren, are out there making multidisciplinary pieces.
Woah.
Truly a masterpiece
This is cinema.
inexpressibly wonderful and frighteningly frank at the same time I didn’t think that anything could surprise me in musical creativity, but this is simply indescribably good
Thank you for this
This is Incredible!   Genius and Truth I recognise.
🔥
Masterpiece
Great video! Powerful
This is the shot that the music industry needs. Amazing to see raw and real music that doesn’t bow down to the idols of money, fame, substances, etc, but subverts them and calls them for what they are, demons that are devouring the souls of the people.  Fight on, Ren. We stand with you.
💯💯
pure effin genuis
absolute masterpiece 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 ren for president, vice, prime minister, and the rest. well done mate, hope people wake up from this
🔥
OooOh shit!!!! WoW!
There's a lesson here and we all as one should heed. Work as one live as one step away from the feed. Master of your craft Ren 💪🏼
We can hit 1M in 3 days!!! Let's go...
Money is just a game we're all forced to play.
fantastically conscious of the dramatic nature of our times, designed to make people react to the bullshit...wonderful.
My whole body has goosebumps by the end of the song, amazing work.
💪💯🔥
this is an absolute masterpiece. its a perfect representation of your capabilities as a musical artist.  dope dude
Love it Ren, Sam and team. Appreciate your art and stance, I agree with 99% of all your content, you open the conversation too many are afraid to. As adults how can we improve life for our families and the world. I am someone who is 44 and been around the world, fought in wars, done humanitarian work among many other things, I am American married 20 years to a Honduran woman, we both have only married to each other and 4 kids with each other none out of wedlock. I say this to show I am an average person, not a lot of money, not living in the streets though my wife and I were both dirt poor in bad areas as children. All this being said, all I want to do is live in peace and enjoy what little time we have with family and friends, help those we can. Though I am retired and 100% disabled I still work a full time job assisting Veterans in healthcare and drug addiction. The conversation we all need to have is what then? There will always be groups of people fighting for power, religion and money, there will always be evil, those that believe “convert, kill or enslave” I don’t trust a damn person in government but if we did away with borders and built utopias, got rid of money and just helped each other in everyday life then how do we manage the people that form to do evil, want their own land, just enjoy hurting people or claiming someone else hurt them to punish a person they didn’t like? There would have to be some kind of council to decide how to handle it. Then those in that council may use their position for sex, goods or whatever. I always hear “do away with government and borders” but without some structure to maintain a type of order we will find ourselves in the same situation. I don’t have an answer, I believe there needs to be REAL unbiased investigations to rid the corrupt of positions of power, things absolutely need to be revamped but I am not smart enough to know the best route. Not trying to argue, just honestly trying to have a real conversation about a way forward if there were “no borders, no government and no money”. Much love everyone! Hope you are all as safe and happy as possible and again, thank you for the great content ❤
Damn!
damn
715k!!!!! 917k!!!!!
Captivating . Great cinematography, too.
Fight the algo
This left me both speechless and in tears. Thank you Ren.
My favorite RENdition #3 !
THAT LAST LINE FUCKED ME WHAT A BRILLIANT WAY TO END THIS SAGA REN WTTFFFF
such a masterpiece
Merci Ren pour ce petit bijou. En France aussi on t'aime ! ❤
😮
I’m on Adam’s account but names Angela Pippus and Best version Of the three total truth and it’s about time we taught are children to make choices based on reality not the sheltered manipulated lies there weaken and brainwashed with now
Just awesome like always
And Ren, what's with you? How are things on your end?
Chilling piece of art - great work Ren
maen capan perffaith i'r prosiect😀
Someone please help me out, why do I know that piano refrain at 3:38 to 3:50? Is it taken/inspired by another song? I feel like it’s an Elton John thing but I may be way off 😅 Just feels familiar & I can’t think why!
If this is what Ren's vision of how his Netflix show would look, I'm here for it!
a perfect capstone to the project!😁
Once again YOU are OUR voice…and I can’t thank you enough for creating the space we all NEED ♥️ I see you and appreciate all that you are.
Is just next level of music
Love this shit Ren
yepppp
The mind of a genius. The story continues ❤
This is an absolute masterpiece!
cool as duck
MASTERPIECE !!!
💯
Ren, you rock. ❤
this is powerful
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ohly f this is a masterpiece
wow
Beautifully tragic...too bad wealth and greed corrupt the minds of the once innocent. I hope Love will one day rule over Power. For now ill just appreciate a vision as unique as yours.
Production quality is getting better. Love Ren & Samuel collaborations
Holy wow
incredible, mind blown on this release.
My only critique of this is I can't play it in the background because I'll start focusing on the music instead of whatever I'm doing!
He gets better and better.  Look forward to everything he makes. Great video too!
"Simply" incredible.
Thank you Ren!
so fucking awesome
When do we get a dvd music video album!!
This is one of the most artistic music pieces I've heard and seen in a very very long time, well fucking done lad. You hit the nail on the head for our world.
If this doesn't spark minds I don't know what will. An absolute masterpiece. Thank you Ren.
We came for Luigi, stayed for the amazing songs
Amazing !!!
I think the thing I appreciate the most about Ren is that the message he's trying to send isn't exactly unique. Of course, with all the production, musicianship, acting and vision that he's shown, we all know he's a talented guy, and no one can deny that; But the things that he wishes to convey, whether it's about personal struggles, or about how the system and society is corrupt and flawed, how the world can be a better place if we cooperated instead of trying to take each other down - Ren's not the first person to say it, he's not the only person to say it, and a lot of us have had similar thoughts - and that's exactly what makes him great. We thought we were alone, we thought that it wouldn't matter, that'll well never be important enough to make a change in the world - until through Ren's music, his work, finding a voice in them, that we realized that we're not alone, that we do matter, that all of this mattered, and together - maybe we CAN make a difference. Keep up the good work Ren, what you are doing is important, and you are making a difference, in the world, and in so many of us.
Epic story telling. Just found you in the last month but been listening to all your stuff and you are just all around an amazing artist. Videos, lyrics, sound. Can't wait to see where you go from here!
Omg omg I have no words! You've done it again!! album ordered
Not only Kudos for Ren and Samuel but also the whole Team behind this Production! Thank you so much! ❤‍🔥
Absolute masterpiece 👏🏼
The camera work in this one, sooo good
Your storytelling is so hypnotizing, man
Was für ein brillanter Künstler!!!
this is so unique and just amazing ❤
He is just the musical creator this world needed
New fav song
You are freaking MAD! But I loved it
i saw this when it came out and was mindblown. forgot to commend for the algorithim. ren you are a revolutionary.
This is on par with "Hi Ren"  It's something new, it's not just music, or storytelling , poetry, or video, it's all of that and still greater than the sum of it's parts.
Thank you Ren. The world needs your truth so badly. Bless you son. Keep it coming. Sending my open heart full of appreciation from the redwood forest in California ❤
It's not really nice to listen to ngl
Brilliant
Extraordinary.
Wow.
FINALLY
HOW DOES THIS NOT HAVE AT LEAST 10 MIL VIEWS YET  YGEYFGIEGIAGF
Insane.
🔥🤯🤯🤯🤯🔥
Wow! Amazing dude. All of us in wales are so proud of you and your music! Keep up the great work fella
One of the best songs I've ever  heard - you are one of the most inspiring and complex artists in our lifetime. Thank you Ren, talhank you for your life changing work.
dam
Bro I’ve been listening to your music since violets tale years ago and that led me to your other songs and albums which I just loved like something else musically and to see you’ve got the recognition you deserve makes me so happy ❤
When you find a song and have it on repeat for an hour❤
OH my goooood ... REN, you are a big talent. My favorite interpret🔥

Got mi sister to name her son after you mate your music change mi life and I just wanna thank you
Amazing
Amazing song, performance blurring the borders of hip hop, theater and rock. Talent to the max
This is a masterpiece
Another Master Piece from REN , His lyrics so well intwined for sure they will leave the listeners behind in their chairs well inclined !!
Leaving a comment for the almighty algorithm. This is a such an amazing piece!! Thanks!
Ren... this is pure insanity. I mean there's no scale to measure your talents. You're a poet. A singer. An actor. A philosopher. My god Ren what a story what a performance! I'm on my knees speechless.
There’s always so much truth and honesty behind your lyrics. You definitely have one of the most creative minds out there. Hopefully songs like these will find the ones that need to hear them and help put life into perspective. Great job as always Ren.
I love your music: you are so talented.  Dunno why I always think of the Peaky Blinders...the haircut i guess
I FUCKING LOVE YOU
Yet again, I am left speechless after a Ren piece of art. Absolutely amazing!!
Oh, I really like this shift in perspective; I have never seen this, or really stayed to think about the story from this point of view before, this is all so new;  how humanising huh  My perspective over things has.. shifted a bit I have to say nontheless hmm interesting, I quite enjoy such things, this really makes me reevaluate parts of sight a bit how fresh
Красивое. Мощное.
Another masterpiece
Damnit Ren, man every fucking time bro your new videos leave me speechless. I think you're the reason there should be a new category at the Grammys.  "Best internet artist" or something like that. Everybody needs to see and hear your message.   Bro you're the real deal
This is art. This is a new genre of music. It’s theatre. Amazing
This mans whole discography is legendary, epic story telling and groovy fuckin tunes to boot. Will definitely keep watching for more.
mind blowing 🤯
Just incredible. No words to describe how good you are.
Well said
❤
This is fuckin brilliant mate
Heavy Song but Completely True and a Work of Art!
Well damn.
i know many comments here will disagree, but ren: if you want to do something eternal, try to stop stopping the music and find a way to get your message into more fluid tones. hi ren was so good when it comes to fluid music exept for those parts talkin without music in behind. and i know you dont want to hear it but just try. you will make a step onwards
This song really reminds me of this other two really nice songs i used to enjoy listening to, sad thing though i forgot their names  I wonder what this is part 3 for  though hmm..
The solution has always been the same, we just choose not to embrace it; Love!  "Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself: I am the LORD." ~ Leviticus  "The second is this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.” ~ Yeshua
Great music, amazing performance
🔥🔥🔥
YOU... are a musical genius and so gifted!  Wen Christmas album Ren?
Fucking goosebumps
4TheAlgorithm

Ren it’s been an honor to live in this timeline where we get to experience your talent. Thank you for what you do!
Absolutely amazing story of man's greed. Ren a story telling maestro. A music maestro  I loved it.
🔥 🔥
Stunning
amazing, talented.. and the lyrics. the whole world should hear this. thank you.
Is this just me, or is it getting better with every video? I am still surprised every time how different and still relevant it is! Never a borring moment with Ren! Thank you for making art, we need something so true and deep
Holy s**t!
Thank you Ren!
Incredible
I have no words other than GENIUS 🔥🔥🔥
Done it again 🔥🔥🔥
1 day and it's over half mil views. Hell yeah get it buddy.
❤
Painfully original 🔥🔥🔥
Watched it like 30 times since yesterday, and I'm still spotting some new details and nuances... A masterpiece of our days, with a powerfull message to match the artistic genius of this... Speechless. Love you man, I hope you'll get well soon and keep bringing us more. I'm so psyched to see what awaits us in the future or Ren.
Part 4 really needs to be about bitcoin...
He should be the artist for the next bond movie!!
Ren you have been sent to us all at this strange time in the world. A poet, lyrical genius, musician, composer and philosopher. They say you can't put an old head on young shoulders. Ren, you would appear to be the exception! God bless you son
Another Masterpiece!
i just noticed this video is the exact same length as hi ren
Rens life path number is 33 and it shows
Lost for words! Masterpiece!! Album is too GOOD!!❤❤❤
Love the video so much.. 🔥 but still unable to understand the transition @ 1:35. Like it doesn’t make sense
So good. Almost like a new art form.
Savage
GO REN! Everyone should see this
damn
Once again Ren did a Masterpiece !
2:59 Rubik's Cube 🥰🇭🇺

‘Art should comfort the disturbed and disturb the comfortable’ amazing job, Ren and Sam 🥰
poetry at its finest

Just when you don't expect it, Ren comes along and blows your mind.
OH DEAR, Oh dear,  Gorgeous! 🔥🔥🔥
You put in so much work into your craft, and it really shows! I'm blown away!
You could never make something bad mate, golden to the core
Another incredible musical masterpiece. Thank you.
Stop makin me cry all time 😢😅
If Thomas Shelby was not more a bookmaker but a god damn well-talented artist 🦍
This might be the greatest masterpiece of art ever recorded since history
Please do not fall.
Ren is the cocaine of musical vibes.
Been sleepin Ren, Black Pegasus is where I caught Hi Ren...Im in now tho....rise on brother you learned a lot just in time it would seem. Wishing you all the things enlightenment can bring.
Holy 💩 a 9 minute music video that felt like 1! AMAZING
And how should I sleep after that?  И как мне спать после такого?
Stunning piece of work mate
Fantastic music, video, and message! What perspective and sense you help bring to this ridiculous world.
pure love
Im liking it more and more. ❤
One word....AMAZING!!!
Thank u mate for this Materpiece. This shit hits hard af. I think I speak for everyone when I say that you really moved us with ur art.  We are here to support you. Keep pushing on mate !!
Thomy Shelby entered the chat.
Ren is a modern day Bard
Awesome!
And so true, we are all chasing something....for no reason!  The only thing we should chase is happiness and great memories. Not money, objects, fame, etc
If you manipulate the data then the lie will sell itself  - Wow on so many levels
I showed this guy to my dad about a year or two ago. And now my dad is showing me stuff
Ren!! Yes mate ✌✌✌✌
Bro the moment right before you picked up the phone, and the globe stopped spinning.  Signifying his world is over.  Brilliant man, how many takes to get that to time out perfect. lol
We are all hearing what you are saying Ren.  What an amazing way to get people to sit up and listen. Just brilliant😊
My dumbass thought he would say world massacration if that is even a word 💀
A breath of thought provoking fresh air
Love your stuff Ren, you deserve more recognition !
Ren you are a bard amongst singers you tell stories of the world not fairytales
Awesome ♥️
MASTERPIECE REN, SURE YOUR WORK IS OF SO MUCH VALUE  CONTRIBUTING TO HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS RAISE 🎉 LET'S CONTRIBUTE! LET'S US ALL CONTRIBUTED! HUMANS, UNLEASH YOUR POTENTIAL
Masterpiece
Superb
This isn't music, it's poetry. You're definitely one of the most creative minds not just in music but with writing storytelling and cinematography. Don't like the song but I don't think it's supposed to be a song but a message, don't ever sell out, you're too influential and will be used to spread hatred and division.
Bravo 👏👏👏👏👏 brilliant!  The world needs this God Bless you.🙏🙏🙏
Hot dam another great one
Just discoverd. This is good !
Genuine master work of art - well done
Great work from the team!
Epic :)
Love your music so much
The people who print the money are the only criminals we should worry about really.  Great to hear someone who gets it right, boiling it all down to the fundamentals of being alive.
I never though someone could express what I think of the world like you do Ren. I don't believe in nation, Politics of rallying around growth of economy. Humanity need to grow up to a better purpose of making money.  Tears in my eyes and my heart in under this pain, I fear the worst with the learders that run the world.
OMG! This is a masterpiece👏👏👏
this song is so important. especially with everything going on in the world currently, we need these reminders
Ren you are a play write
You are the world's greatest moral story teller.
Genious.
This video was masterfully made.
As always just masterful!!❤
Would love to see/hear a collaboration with Ren and Lady Gaga. I think they would create some pretty amazing art/music together.
Ren is the Best💪!!! Ren you do very emotional song,maybe you can do some song for Ukraine 🇺🇦 they need help,they need some power of words!!!Thank you Bro!!!
Another masterpiece. Your words, your story, art and words hit at not just an emotional level but a cellular level.  Viewing your videos and hearing your messages changes a person.  Thank you for what you do Ren.  You are truly an inspiration in this world of fakes.
Very deep Ren ! Unique, Original, Awesome, I hope you have a Great Day !
Truthful & mesmerizing
1:40 monkey time
Cinematic masterpiece
Man... Storytelling is a really good talent that very few have, but when you have it you can touch the heart of thousands just with your words... In a world where words have lost their weight and meaning and people just seem to be mumbling nonesense, is really good to have someone who can talk so gracefully and meaningfull... I love you and what you do ren. I mean it.
comment for the algorithm i guess
Honestly this guy is amazing. His music makes you think. 100% needs to write a musical (each is like it's own little film already) but yeah, incredible 👏
Algorithm comment 😊
a story in the lyrics, musically talented, video intensifies the story visually. Brilliant.
Bump this up
Just realised the hook from Money Game 1 and 2 is in the violin section when they come in. Chef's kiss.
What id give for an extensive playout of the stringed instruments.
He did it again dang
Tragic, and beautiful!
Speechless!!
It is a joy to watch everything he does. Musical talent..... genius. Artistic video.....amazing.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Absolute masterful storytelling Ren.
wow... its absolutely incredible!
Dope mix of storytelling, music and spoken word. Well done sir!
♡
Tbh pt2 was better
Wow. Next level Sir.
Wonderful piece
Been saying this since the blind eye days. Creativity and artistry unmatched bout time people recognize. I mean the writing alone. Crazy. Congrats ren
A master class of individual theater.
Wordless
Bless up
Amazing. I’m going to run a watch party at work with the 3 Money Games together.
Hi "Ren" ... firstly I wanna say I'm not actually used to go for that kinda music but I really like ur music , creation & depiction but ... BUT don't put any "suicidal" demonstrations in ur music video ... Strong suggestion for those who're already down & have suicidal thoughts ... Please keep going with ur best for the best to the others
Nothing short of a masterpiece
Tell it.
90% of these comments are bots. Lol
Only 1 day and the views are crazy
YouTube really wants this guy to be famous. Lol
Well done as always Ren, I really enjoyed it and will no doubt watch it again and again.  One aside : Utopias are also a construct and most unfortunately, antithetical to the true nature of people.
I don’t necessarily care for the music but the cinematography is absolutely phenomenal.
Bravo. That was some real sheeeet. Thanks Ren.
*SHE SELLS SEA SHELLS ON THE SEA SHORE!!*
Your music transcends art. You can feel the start of a collective renaissance. I truly believe we’re in a period of significant change in human consciousness and it’s representative through your work. It’s absolutely beautiful.
This isn't a song. It's art. This isn't art.It's a masterpiece. This isn't a masterpiece, it's freaking beauty!!!
This is amazing!
It is this eternal dance that separates human beings From angels, from demons, from gods And I must not forget, we must not forget That we are human beings.  Ren you are all of them, except a devil. My closest friend who I spent 20+ hours a week with and knew since 1999, committed suicide, shockingly and unexpectedly in 2021.  You have given me perspective, made me forget my troubles and weaknesses, plus made me analyse myself my troubles and weaknesses. Without your music and discovering you I'd probably have gone the same way as Stu, I need to live for my sons sake, my friends sake. I'm getting a large memorial tattoo for him done, with lots of Ren easter eggs.  Bought the pre order 3 CD album, which'll never be opened and kept with the other memories.  Thank you, on behalf of all the open minded people of the world❤
artwork, ARTWORK
Wow
You will be great and you will make waves, and you’ll shake up the whole world…  You’re a genius 😉
F'ing Brilliant mate!!!!!
So much talent here ! ❤
Leaving a comment, NOT for the algorithm, this is a masterpiece
Wow
this is the story of mr jimmy beast
Masterpece
One day ago, this was the released, and now today it just reached 666k
Just insane.
I've been ill my whole life. Having music that eloquently explain what it's like to live with a chronic illness is invaluable. I wonder if showing my GP or PIP would help me? Thank you Ren.
This is no song, this is theatre, a MUSICAL, a tragedy! Beautiful!  It says so much - this is a story about parent child relationship, a story about human nature, about our values and our system.  We hear you Ren! Thank you for sending the message to the world! <3 Your delivery has such beauty in its rawness and trueness. Your capability to be true will always draw people to you and will never get old!
❤❤❤❤
Ren the great
So. Fucking. Good.
This makes my hair raise ! Lyrical genius !
Bros finger gonna fall off from loss of circulation... Excellent song!!
always with the fire.
Love this so much!
Can't wait to have a look round the set tomorrow! ❤
Even though many hear this , its easy to say that a lot of you do not listen as it fades away. For all the people that feel touched and find truth in his art, don't just go and sit there... contribute your heart. Thanks Ren.. you are a truly inspiring human being.
❤❤❤
Love Hi Ren but the rest of his rap is shite.
Ren in a suit is quite dapper! I’m glad that he has remained independent. I don’t know that any music label would know what to do with him. His talent integrates sooo many genres of music, and he can leap fully into any one of them. I love all the new music, but I just hope Ren doesn’t forget… a lot of people love it when you’re jamming out to Black Sabbath, The Sheriff, and “It’s Alright”.
Brillaint
Love,From Louisiana!! This is amazing!!!!
It’s hard to say much else besides, WOW! 👏🏻
Thx !
In the 4th month and on the 26th day William Shakespeare was born .  426 years later Ren was born . .coincidence or re-incarnation lol
Shouldn't use a silver spoon
Amazing ! been a fan for years. now I see Ren on the top of my youtube suggestions where he always should be. Yes. 💯
This is amazing, and the album is absolute fire!! Just got my Pigbae and Sackman figures. Jenny, Screech, and Car Park dude are next!! You're shining Ren, you're shining!!! 💜💜💜
The seven sins, here we have greed.  Without knowledge of or knowing God, people are demonically influenced and/or oppressed,  whether they know it or not. They are left open to such with lack of God. Believe it or dont its true
Using the wheelchair and all they symbolise, the struggles we face in this ableist world...Guessing you'll use black face next so you can spit at those who suffer racism. Get both -isms in use for views.   You're right; this isn't entertainment.
So true and so heartbreaking. Masterpiece as always.
So so good! Very impressed!
After watching this a few times, I woke up this morning and this song came to mind. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QKiFJdljwk
Thank you Ren and the whole team, amazing amazing and even more amazing! Masterpiece!
Just wow.. this video is epic. Xx
"bought to support" already had access via Spotify, I just can't get enough of Ren! F***ing unbelievable talent
Omg omg I don’t believe in god but someone certain gave you purpose my friend. Stay honest ! Xo
Just as terrible as Hi Ren.  You social rejects are really letting these gender reveal parties get outta hand.
OMG I thought Crutch was my favourite video. Money Game part 3 just blew that out of this galaxy. Just wow Ren your a GENIUS please never stop creating art like this. Even if it means you need to stay an independent artist. Always know your Renegades love you.
Class!!
holy shit that was great!
Ren, damn bro. You are brilliant and I love your stories!
Couldn’t have dropped at a more apt time, thousands of people dying for the money game.
Foda
There are very few words you can put to this. Excellent, well done and you can tell it isn’t going to be the only thing that you guys do is going to lead the way.
Leaving a comment for the algorithm. This is a MASTERPIECE!!
Masterpiece!!! Thank you a lot my friend.
Well done you Ren.  Very good again.  Whoever chooses your sets and writes your videos is also very good.  Well done you lot, you must be having such fun.
Love everything about this
Masterful
poetry pure and simple
Just brilliant 👌🏽
That's so fuckin authentic, thought through, so real, filthy, sad, it gives me chills - doesn't happen often. Masterpiece
Just pure chills
Poetry
11th on trending..well fucking done ren!
Chills.. just chills my guy! I have no idea how everything you release is so good
never knew piano could hit so hard
I cannot imagine what’s coming next! Every time you blow me away!!! Thank you for your existence, for your wisdom, for sharing this with the world!!! Love you so much!❤
This is the first rap that I have heard that had a story to tell. Original music no famous artists backing track. Im 70 and have been around the block.Keep it real.
Wow.
*So good...if u want check my channel out i also do music*
Its not really my taste but i love the beginning u played
The piano is such an awesome add dude
Its so amazing to see people of all ages loving rens music! Heck yes everyone!!!!
THE WAIT WAS ALL WORTH IT
Respect for the art of filming this video.
Ren is on the same level as Lionel Messi. There are others in the conversation, but at the end of the day we all know the deal.
Algo boost for the THREEQUEL LEZZGOOOOO
Absolutely incredible!!!! Nailed it!!💜
Loving the amount of older people vibing with Ren; keep uniting us!
I'm 136 and in all my years I haven't seen a man with such effortless talent seriously this guy is a genius❤🔥
The more you watch it the better it gets! 🖤💚
Bro keeps on pushing out gem after gem and he keeps delivering. This is f*cking outrageous, to keep it in your words
Beautiful REN and true ❤
I just can't stop listening. It's Saturday morning, still dark out, and I'm blasting this album before we open because it just brings me so much joy 🥰
I'm crying my eyes out, this is fire
Ren Shelby
I don’t know why but I want to cry.
A masterpiece performed by a genius.
I love that you can artistically express what I’m thinking is going on in the world today. Music is such a force in my life, always has been. Look at past musically and you can see what people were experiencing at that particular time and place. You are doing this in the most thought provoking and beautifully artistic way. I envy your mind and I send love and peace to your heart. From your 68 year old girl fan❤
Absolutely incredible. Where life meets poetry❤
boss moves
Im so happy he made a part three
Beaultiful and brutal.
Amazing storytelling love your guys work keeps your attention immersed from start to finish that it makes those 9mins feel like seconds and before you know it's over, much love and respect keep up the good work and spreading your truth
Masterpiece
Art.
Masterpiece!Wow!😮
I love you Ren. Your music and videos are so so good!
The wordplay is out of this world
9 minutes of my life (plus the mutiple 9 minues I've watched it again) that I never want back. A masterpiece 👏
Always doing his thing.
Hell yeah so good
Ren is the Greatest Artist of Our Generation!  Change my mind...
Better than good
🔥❤️‍🔥
This masterpiece was absolutely worth the wait
Okay then Ren 😮
Genius
I so happy YouTube recommended this
Dont let the 9 min duration fool your short attention span nuggin', this will just pass by like a breeze of fresh chillin air behind your neck.
Es una pieza maestra sublime. Muchas gracias, Ren
This is a MASTERPIECE!  🔥🔥
Can’t stop watching it. I go from streaming the album and then back to this. That suit!!  Still my heart
Absolutely brilliant
Oh my god, this is art in it's highest form.
Well, that felt like a fast rollercoaster,  and I want to get back in line
Damm. This is truly a masterpiece. I adore your creativity and the clips and lyrics you make come to life. Honestly this is brilliant
Damn 🔥🔥🔥
I absolutely love Ren's use of pauses are. Examples are the pause before the last line here, the breath taken as he stands and steadies himself before walking through Violet's Tale and the momentary pause of thought in Chalk Outlines before the line "I hope I'm someone else in the morning ".
I've listened/watched this over and over. The sheer genius and genuine passion of it is truly incredible. Massive kudos to you and Samuel 🐷
Cinematography, the message, each movement by the people choreographed, and Ren, being the master he is. I feel like this is how people see bards back then (or even in fiction). THIS IS AWESOME. I am really captivated by your artistry, Ren. Thank you for sharing this wonderful masterpiece. Congrats and thanks to all those involved in your works!
This is pure art
Ren amazes me every time
Ren has made it to Pakistan 🇵🇰  🤯🤯🤯🔥🔥🔥🔥
he did it again, the crazy bastard.
Thank you mr. Gill for creating art.
Greetings🇵🇭🇨🇦 U got my Respect  New subs here👌im 43 yrs old,this my shit my Shadow to follow...  Only 3 words i can say to U REN...  MAN FUCKING GENIUS...  🔥F🔥I🔥R🔥E🔥
Pretentious, overly-dramatic whiney baby music
amazing powerful video like always love you ren
You are a beautiful artist
Another thought provoking video from Ren. I'm someone who strongly believes we should strive for a world like in Star Trek. Everyone has what they need and money has nothing to do with it. Money needs to become a thing of the past. People should work to do their part as well for the betterment of man, but be able to return home without the stress of needing to make rent or pay bills.   I look forward to more songs like this. It's such an artistic piece that explains our unfortunate placement in the society we have created. It won't be easy to change, because so many people aren't willing or open to a possibility of a better future if we make such drastic societal changes. Money was invented for trade and somewhere it became more than it's original intended purpose.   This was 🔥🔥🔥
das wassup
never ceases to amaze me
Sample: Greig Piano Concerto.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
You can buy impunity for genocide and ethnic cleansing. Azerbaijan paid the UN a million dollars before their trip to Artsakh and Armenia. The UN fact checking trip only lasted a day, performed after 10 months of starvation blockade and gunfire. They only went after the ethnic cleansing was over and 120,000 people were uprooted once again.  In 2023.
Amazing ❤
I am speechless. THIS is art at its finest.
Wow! Ren, I can see you writing and performing in a musical!! You are one who has "ascended" and I'm so glad I get to watch. Your work is incredible! ❤
Wicked
That was brill.
Art
How does he do this? You need to go to hell and literally die inside to create stuff like this and he did this with Lyme disease so for all of you artist if you want inspiration get Lyme disease :) if you get out of it you will be special!
While i absolutely love what you are bringing to the world i want you to make time for yourself and avoid the trappings of money and fame.  I will celebrate you taking a year out to just be ren.  Love you man, pure genius.
Fuck.......gobsmacked.....again! Bravo and thank you.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Absolutely phenomenal as always, Ren 👏🏽
Always an adventure, and story pushing boundaries. Well done again Ren.
Je reminds me of Thomas Shelby and this is straight up a masterpiece again 🙏
That was incredible.
The camera work is great!
🔥🔥🔥
Yep. Sick.
❤
this is good
Love it ❤
The money game songs get better and better  I watched it 4 times back to back. Beautiful
Brings to tears.  Very intense.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 THIS IS A MASTERPIECE
Brilliant! Ren is a lyric genius!
Incredible work bro !
You are a world class story teller :)
Amazing
Good one
That is music you don't hear too often, powerful stuff
#Ren a unique genius.
insane
Magnificent...on another level...Ren you are the GOAT.🎉
If I had a nickel for every time ren killed himself in a money game video, I’d have two nickels, which isn’t a lot but it weird that it happened teice
👍
Im leaving a comment for the algorithm as well, as I have to agree with previous comments, masterpiece
YES !! This is the Ren I know !! Love it !!!!
I'm half a world away Yet you're talking to me Making rhymes with simple words And yet I hope you can see Years inside the system Yet I'm slowly getting out I still play the piano  And I scream and I shout I'm more than nothing  I can be any damn thing I listen and believe what I maybe can bring It's artists like you That make me see what I'm about Making music for the sake of it And not for the clout.   Thanks.
Wow!!! So powerful and true!!
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
This is a master piece ❤
❤
❤
❤
❤
❤
❤
Everyone in this world should know your name.
Brilliant ...and EPIC !!!
Just as impressed with this as I was with every other part. A criminally underrated talent who should be topping the charts.
incredible
This video reminded me immediately of Rene Magritte's paintings.
Amazing!
how 9 minutes pass so quickly.... ya know it's good when it doesn't drag
I am 41 now. 4 more years to go.
Just masterpiece !
Masterpiece!❤
Thank you Ren
Damn
That was unique. Love it:)
This is if Shakespeare did music and movies...
as a 110 year old this really hits my soul
Is it just one cameraman and one take???
This is what ART should be. Blend of theatrics and music, plays, movies. Ren was and is the future at all times. Please keep going!!!
Mcafee?
🔥 🔥 🔥
Very very in your face. And still some people are in denial that the world is not the same. Everybody should see this video but than again some can not understand English because they never learned that at school.  In this time people are getting stupider by the hour and although I will never give up the fight for freedom for everyone, I still ask myself: "is it already to late?"  Ren you're fantastic I love to hear your very complex,but easy to understand lyrics.  From the Netherlands the Saltyarmy🧂🙏❤️
Also, Ren, your music has literally saved my life many times. Thank you 🙏🏼 from the bottom of my heart ❤️
Protect Ren at any cost
Holy smokes, I’m only 4:30 minutes in and I have goosebumps and am so moved by the talent I can’t even…..
We have been waiting with anticipation for this one and it did not disappoint. It was beyond anything I could have imagined. That piano playing is hauntingly beautiful.  What an amazing piece of theatre mixed with a  jarring dose of reality. I was drawn in from the first note, mesmerised, barely drawing a breath.  I sat there, hand clutching my chest, tears welling. The message hits like a punch in the guts. Your vision for your work is meticulously thought out and your team have such passion and dedication to achieving this end.  Sam is a master at his craft and he deserves every accolade he gets for his work.  The world is a far better place with you in it, REN. I hope we can follow your words and achieve a kinder world for all. It seems impossible with all the darkness and atrocities at the moment but we must keep trying. WE ARE ALL HUMAN BEINGS. ❤❤❤❤❤
It was worth the wait!! Ive followed you for a few years and to see you explode this year is all you deserve. Not music i would normally listen to but you've widened my horizons and for that i thank you. I wish you well and look forward to following you in your incredible future
i'm glad there are people out there that enjoy what sounds like nonsensical noise
As a 52 year old man, this is just a masterpiece….pure art and intellect
35 here. I'm doing ok i guess, but there is a fear that i should follow that money and fame... Awsome and terrifing clip
Genius!.
Mind blowing !!!
Amazing
Holy shit, that was tragic, hard-hitring and gorgeous. You make more than just music, you make art.
Brilliant
Boy that escalated quickly.
Another mad ass masterpiece
Wow!! Just WOW!!! Powerful and brilliant!!
I would love to see Ren and grandson collab on a song.
One of the best theatrical acts! Really looking forward to see you live REN!!!
This is a true creativity
Thank you for everything you do for us and the humanity with your music.... thank you for this masterpiece I just cried... a fan since 2018
🔥🔥🔥😎
By order of the Peaky Fuckin Blinder,This is good.
Masterpiece ❤
Tommy Shelby really took a career change
Thank you again for this experience ! The sound effects on the gun waving around were too much though ! Sounded like the gun was missing half its pieces.
This song didn't even felt like 9 minutes. Very exquisite
He did it again. Legend
👌🏽as always 🙏🏼♥️
Teamwork makes the dream work! Amazing. Again. Of course ❤
That's not shotty horror
beautiful
MASTERPIECE! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
YESS🔥🔥
More genius.
a work of art as always, well done ren
This is what music should be about 💖
succy, nbr 2 was great
A short story, a bit like jackanory of old,  with a frequency, his visions are a joy to behold ... Ren is one the great story tellers of this reality. Genius
OH hell yeahhh
Hype to watch this in a bit
So authentic Masterpiece.
Just realized you are awesome at playing the piano too. This doesn't surprise me in the least of course. Kudos to the other pianist ( Samuel?). Loving EVERYTHING you do man, you truly rock!!!
Man, this kinda fucked me up
💯 True words ❤ Absolutely love REN everything he does is incredible 🔥🙏
money is the best invention of mandkind
This is basically the story of Tony Stark.
Let's get it up to "Hi Ren". The "Money Game" deserves it. Much love
holy crap 9 minutes
Dude why are your fans so old? Bloody septuagenarians are in the comment section
Speechless
🔥
wooooowww!!!
This is a straight banger 🔥🔥🔥
This is a masterpiece
insane! that's it🤯
Thanks for yet another great piece of art as well as another look into your mind master Ren! You truly never disappoint! In my opinion, you’ve already effortlessly earned the title of “legend”! Keep it up!
The Artistry you use to deal with pain of corrupt the soul in us all is beyond words. Just grateful your using your gifts wisely.  Someone wrote what good it is to gain the world and loose your only begotten soul.  I believe their are enough blessings for all life however mans emptiness stops it from flowing to all life. Stay Blessed Ren
Jacqueline Barfoot truely said , money game three has resonance for me, i had it all, family, a home, good health, then covid hit and wiped out my family, then parkinsons hit me and i lost my money, my health, my home my freedom, now i spend all day in a wheelchair watching life go by and IM only 56  - REN said it all, we can only survive if we change.
I have watched this so many times, and it still makes me emotional ❤
Once again a Master Piece ! bringing tears to my eyes - Thanks Ren !
Incredible. Am i right in thinking that whrn jimmy turns 30 its a reference to dumb king come? Keep up fatty ya losing the race 😂
cinematic masterpiece...holy
Incrediblly addicive listening to this. So much truth and power in this song - absolute goosebumps. Your album is the first i have bought in a decade and the first i have ever pre-ordered. Its an honor to experience your art. Thank you!
France knows you now and love your work. Amazing story amazing speech amazing flow amazing rhymes. Just WOOOW.
Another masterpiece by bardcore king Ren.
Insane composition, storytelling and cinematography this one speaks to me on another level
Another epic piece of work 😀
If there's a better music video shot this year, I've not seen it... Hats off Sam and obvs Ren the goat❤
Leaving a comment for the algorithm.

I cannot stop watching this. I can't even describe how it makes me feel. Simply brilliant
This is 🔥!
Woahhhh awesome ❤❤❤❤
Ooof, instant classic
I’ve watched this several times. Before, I said I didn’t like the ending because I found it disturbing. It could not end any other way! Brilliant piece of art. Congratulations to all of you!
This was epic!! The music, the filming and the message.. and your ‘Sickboi’ album and is awesome!! Never disappoints Legend!
Probably the most creative artist currently. Love it
this is SUCH A BANGER
Day 3 - still good

56 years of age been heavily involved in the music scene etc BUT IVE NEVER CAME ACROSS ANYONE LIKE MR REN GILL..  Mind blown yer again!! Wasn’t expecting anything less though.. bravo my Lil G bravo 👏 👏👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️
Jesus Christ. This is a fucking masterpiece. Ren you are a Legend.
He did it again
👹👹👹
MASTERPIECE.
Thank you Ren for being a voice of truth in a spiderweb of lies.
It's a true masterpiece but could you please release a version without all the cuts in music so i could listen to this more often on yt music ❤
Yet another masterpiece
Legend! 🔥
THANK YOU
Inspired. Congrata Ren & co
Dude, you will change more hearts than William Shakespeare
This is awesome I wish more people could see it
👌 👏 😍 👍
😊
Hell yeah, Ren! You keep making the most ETHEREAL music. I am always left speechless 😶 you have such a beautiful, REAL soul who knows how to communicate the 'human condition' so very well. You leave me in tears wether it's from joy at how beautiful you piece things together (I find myself smiling A LOT when I listen to you) or from pain that I can relate to. (Cause no one can express these pieces more beautifully than you!)
This is absolute genius. Ren you are on track to change the world! Keep them coming 💯🔥
Well….this artist attracts all ages. And that is an achievement in itself…..even if his words just makes you think and maybe re-adjust just slightly your thinking…..then it works.
when they dont ban or shadow ban on youtube it should be common knowledge they are paid shills.
Finally iTS HERE THE MASTERPIECE IS HERE FOLKS!❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I'm so glad Ren is getting more and more recognition. He is almost single handedly restoring my faith in modern music. Bravo to you, Ren!
My favourite kind of Ren
super!!!!
I think there is only one word i can use to describe this, POWERFUL!!!
Noice
This is incredible. Thanks Ren
turn this into movie
Flip ❤
Ren, your work is a mirror to society. But instead of just showing us what's wrong, why not show us how to find the beauty that exists, too? Our world is not merely a cesspool of greed and malice. There's hope, love, and camaraderie that binds us all. Your art has the power to inspire change, to be part of the solution rather than part of the problem.   Your work is stirring, your talent undeniable. But let’s move beyond the echo chamber of anti-establishment sentiments. The world has had its share of conspiracy theories. It’s time to rise above and be part of the solution. Your art can be the catalyst for change, guiding us to find the beauty that’s inherent in our existence.
Wtf that’s incredible! Bravo Ren!!
I didnt think I would find music that would move me again without pulling out my old vynil ..  :)
The only way to make people listen is with a compelling story.
I hope people listen closely. There is wisdom beyond his age in his songs.
This whole thing is a work of art. The music, cinematography, acting, sound. A masterpiece!!
This is an absolute masterpiece! It's amazing to have seen you grow since I started following you about 5 years ago!! Goose bumps ✨✨
Man, never songs of 9 minutes were so short for me. Great Job Ren! This is art!
When Ren is singing, I am listening to what he said. Powerful stuff you got
ADDICTIVE VOICE + ADDICTIVE ACTING = Ren
This is just WOW, the lyrics MASTERPIECE and just the setting is ahhhhhh. Wanna see you live This just gets me thinking about life and still amazing ❤
Your work never fails to move me. From the serious to the fun your talent always shines but in my opinion your real genius is in bringing what you see in the world into your work with such clarity and power. ❤️✊🏻
nice
amazing 💙
More people need to know about Ren.  Total, absolute total, phenomenon.
Wow!
This masterpiece is what everybody should see and hear. Amazing work! 🔥❤
for me one of the artists of recent times. Absolutely brilliant. Whenever I think, okay... what a bomb, the next hit comes along. No idea where he takes it from, Ren just seems to be endlessly creative.
great stuff, who said theater is boring?
John Lennon ~~》Tupac ~~》 Ren.  Revered musicians trying to open our eyes and spark change. It feels like we're getting closer and closer. It just takes time.
chills
Wasnt expecting a part 3, but im here for it
Incroyable 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
Wow! I'm about to turn 61 and I quit listening to new music a long time ago. I think music these days sucks but your video was the first thing I saw so I listened to it. I was so impressed I came to leave a comment and wow! What do I see😅 I see a bunch of other comments from people my age saying the same thing I'm saying so I think hey dude it looks like you got it made with the old fogies😂 and I'm willing to bet you got it with the  people your age as well!❤❤❤At least the ones who have taste.
The string arrangements and call backs to previous works is something that's already injected it's essence into my mind.  Stunning.
Absolutely speechless at this creativity and just pure raw emotion. I love this absolutely amazing
I can't say anything more besides that this is an absolute masterpiece..
Part 4.. Working man. Fed up and tired. Still pushing.
It reminds of the old german tale "The fisherman and his wife" about greed...
Beautiful naïveté, if we all got infected, the world would be a better place.
Such a sick video! The videography is incredible
aw ren uv done it again.... no words... but, thankyou!! 50k+ likes in 1 day and im not surprised, liked, copied link and shared for you!
Intro kinda reminds me of one of AOT's openings
Art
You never fail bro you are a rare musical genius ❤
Wowowowowowoweeweee! Ty Ly! 👑🙏🤍
The world isn’t ready for you Ren. Damn shame really, because you drop straight knowledge in every track. I see you, boi. Never change man. You continue to inspire. Daily…
Where do I even begin, this sir is a masterpiece! ❤
Kool
I have been waiting for money game part 3 ever since I heard it was in the works. This is far more than what I was expecting. This is another piece of art that transcends music, thank you for this!
Show them Ren. Fuck this society. Love and harmony is universal and starts within you.
Whoa.
I thought at 47 I was too old to become "a fan" of any new artist.  My favourite music is 60s/70s rock. Before my time but I felt that musicians expressed themselves more freely then.  I never thought that I'd find an artist that would impress me as much as Pink Floyd. Thanks to the Internet, artists now have a platform to produce what they want and boy has that produced one of the most unique and gifted talents ever to grace the industry.  Ren has suffered to get to where he is now and although a curse for him, for the rest of us it is a gift.  🎶Oh, reign, reign reign Rens music it will reign   It's such a shame, the price you paid  But it all lead, to this old money game🎶
Yes another masterpiece, OMG that is incredible.
Listening to this alone, in a deserted park, feeling like shit, at 3:30 am hits different.
number one in the itunes and amazon music charts for the UK!! you fucking did it man!
So damn good
At last some quality and not pop shit on this afterparty bullbs i never watch exp for juan luis g
Harsh but true. Stand up from the table and leave the game. Life gives you more than that even when the affection is strong, you could be stronger. You will loose most of you so called „friends“. It’s like being the driver of a party night. Now you see how disgusting people act, talk and behave.
Pure Genius!
I’m 44, I’ve never had money 😢 And I’m not happy.
This is art. Poetry of the way I never heard being expressed the way you did it. I love when you sing. But this is different. This is artistic. 👏
OMG !!! Big respect !!
OMG YES REN! ITS SUCH A BEAUTY TO WATCH YOUR ART AND WATCH YOU EVOLVE!!
Renning all day for real
Yesterday was boss
That was great didnt feel like 10 mins at all cuz of how invested i was
and to think... i remember when Luigi was just talking about some sea shell lmao  ...  Nothing else but a masterpiece.  The world N E E D S this... a whole lot of it.  Thanks Ren:)
...and just imagine what his potential netflix series be like, MG3 being Sam and Ren's highest budget video.
This is the wake up call for a lot of people i know, sadly they ain't even going to listen
Meh.  Too fake drama for me. I have too much real drama in my life
Gênio, gênio! Continue fazendo arte
I can't tell if you are getting better or if the budget being bigger is just revealing more of your talent. This is honestly amazing, I don't typically leave a comment but I want more people to see this
You drop bombs in this industry man, I can’t wait to see what else you release
🔥
This is amazing! My heart was beating so hard and I'm covered in goosebumps. The track and the video are ridiculously good! Thank you 😊
He just can't miss!
Fuck.
This is top story telling just a serious fucking masterpiece well done!
There are no words that can adequately express how amazing this masterpiece is.
I can't begin to imagine the monumental amount of work that went into setting all of this up, and pulling it off. Ren, you are an inspiration of several generations! Your team is just as phenomenal too! Congratulations to everyone involved - bask in the satisfaction of pulling off this masterpiece!
Never disappoints
I assume the charts are based on the count of views? Imagine, if they would use the time viewed. 9 min each time
I just felt every tiny hair on my entire body stand straight up…I hope the people who truly need their hearts changed by this message are open to receiving it… that’s the brilliant thing about this beautiful man’s music/poetry/artwork, it captivates you & draws you into a different world, just like a great book does, only you then realize it’s not some parallel fantasy world, it’s the actual world we already live in…
Yesss this is a masterpiece!! You never cease to amaze us Ren!! ❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥
Amazing, its getting better and better!
Musical perfection has a new definition: Ren.
Absolutely  phenomenal writing mate. The story telling is some of the best i've ever heard! full credit to the video team as well!
You could legitimately make a movie from this song...amazing.
Why am I a tears? Such a powerful piece. Ren and Sam together produce yet another masterpiece
Goodjob
me when Ren drops a new banger: MINE MINE MINE MORE!!1
Big up to my men REN amazing brother a little look in our hihop of many years ago https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVSOxYBdI3k
😮😮
Phenomenal
Genius!
Love you Ren
Mind blown, unplugging from the Matrix
Ren honestly you have done so well for yourself ❤
This is brilliant. I've been following you for years, and I'm impressed with the stories you tell and the messages you impart. But the Money Game series has always hit different due to the serious issues you've addressed regarding consumption, capitalism, greed, sustainability, and more. The way you've imparted these messages is beautiful, powerful, and impactful.  I can't wait to see what's next.
A Video and a Message for the Ages! ❤🙏⌛🤝👍
Algorithm comment. Leave more everyone.
The whole series should be taught in schools. This last one is a creative masterpiece.
dope
Hats off 💪
AMAZING    but just a cool idea why don't you do a Steveys tail I know this is pretty much you telling a story but just a nice little idea❤😊
THIS is an artist ladies and gentlemen
Wow, stunning from start to finish. Really like this series of songs in particular, i see so many people around me who fit part 3 of these songs. The main thing that guides thier lives is money and its really sad. I wonder how many of them have/ or will become some part of this song in time.  Truely helps to set perpectives. I couldnt do you and your team justice with compliments but i will say this, absolutely epic production! Very impressive stuff when compared to million dollar labels and artists who continue to pump out mindless trash.
wow
Brilliant!❤️✨
for algo
Discovered you through Money Game Part 2, loved your Money Game songs, Hi Ren is still one of my favourite pieces of art in the world, and now Money Game Part 3, I am borderline crying.
This is amazing!
ChatGPT Examines Money Game Part 3.  Ren's "Money Game, Pt. 3" is a gripping narrative about the life of Jimmy and the consequences of unchecked ambition, the relentless pursuit of wealth, and the costs of living in a materialistic society. The lyrics are an examination of the often toxic relationship people have with wealth, success, and the approval of others.  The song follows Jimmy's rise, where he starts with an innate drive ("Mine, mine, gimme!") and is subsequently shaped by the expectations and values instilled in him by his father. The lyrics detail Jimmy's rapid ascent to power and wealth and his subsequent descent into darkness, addiction, and tragedy. It highlights the dangers of equating worth with monetary success and the societal structures that perpetuate this mindset.  The second part of the song shifts the focus from Jimmy's personal narrative to a broader societal commentary. Ren highlights how many aspects of our society (money, borders, politics) are human constructs. He emphasizes that these systems, designed by people, perpetuate division, greed, and conflict.  The song ends on a somber note, encapsulating Jimmy's tragic fate and serving as a cautionary tale. It underscores the idea that unchecked ambition and the blind pursuit of wealth can lead to one's downfall.  Overall, "Money Game, Pt. 3" is a poignant critique of societal values and the consequences of unchecked ambition. Ren's storytelling ability and social commentary are evident in this work, which serves as a compelling exploration of human nature and societal structures.
Truly an incredible piece of work
Excellent!  I love the duration of some of these recent works of art.  What are the chances of seeing Insomnia part 2 or an extended version? Or Dominoes? Two of my favourites that finish way too soon. Have to hit repeat.
Haha ren your off tap man... brilliant I love it...😄😊
Great❤❤
Wow. I was like there’s no way I’m sitting through 9 min. And I couldn’t believe it was over when it ended. That was amazing.
genius
goosebumps all over!!!!
Epic!
Thank you❤️
Amazing!!!  Thank you for putting it in words and creating this unique video.  I admire your ability with words. I describe you to my friends as the Shakespeare of the 21st century! I must say, somewhere  in the fifth  minute of the video there was a rocket in the video. ‏And when the rocket sounded in the video I was convinced that there is a rocket outside.  so I put down the headphones and I tried to hear the sound outside. I thought there is an attack or something.  After a couple of times doing that I tried to hear the video with one headphone.   It took me a couple of moments to understand that the sound came from the video. (I'm from Israel) It was amusing when I realized it was the video and not a real rocket. And in the same time it was insightful for how post traumatic country we are... Amazing video from an amazing Artist:))) Please do more of those ;) Thank you for your art!!!
thank you!
This song encompasses everything I love about you and your music. This is now the song I will use to introduce people to you. Not only did you stop me giving up on my dream to be a performer, but you are now my biggest inspiration. Thankyou Ren.
Modern-day orchestrated musical.....creative stuff of the future
Masterpiece of art , well done, Mr.
amazing really, this song comes out at this time, we need to hear this dont we REN, your a mad genius my friend, amazing as always
And the Oscar for best picture goes to:

.
♠︎♡◆♧♣︎◇♥︎♤
Good
I love a good Hunter Biden story.
Incredible
This is modern day Shakespeare!
I've loved everything you've done so far but this surpassed my expectations. Absolutely genius!!! Huge congratulations to everyone involved ❤
Wow
WHATTTTTTTTTTTT
A master of his art.
I was following Ren's music for over a year now and it's always perfection! This song especially has EVERYTHING in it! Truly a Masters art! Only a man who has seen it all can come up with such deep songs! ❤
Just a masterpiece ❤🎉😮
My friend 49yr old killed himself 2 weeks ago, not over money, over a woman he was with for 30 years that fell apart. Money means nothing!
Absolutely amazing, Ren! Much love! 🙌🏻
Good shit. ❤really good shit❤
I am a 72 year old man, once America and now Canadian. I have been following you for going on 6 years, as best I could before your new success has made it a lot easier. LOL You may or may not realize it but many songs and efforts from my youth are reflected in your music. We fought the good fight back then, also. And, at one point in time we thought we were winning, but it was an illusion. It is sad than many of those songs and feeling are just as true today as back then. Very sad. Your music  transcends those songs  and are put in a way that trike people in new ways. The war was not won. I'm not even sure how many battles we may or may not have won, but we tried and now, I am tired. I do the best I can to help and fight still and your music and words stir me on like I haven't felt in years. Thank you. Thank you very much. Fight on Ren. Fight hard and never give up. Thank you for the inspiration and the renewed vigor. You are doing good work both artistically and for society. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. .... PS, am waiting for my cd to ship and anxiously waiting to put it in my car so I can listen to you on the road also. Thank you gain.
Amazing lyricist
This is absolutely epic, Ren. So proud of you for speaking the truth, opening minds, and bringing much needed change to this world. Thank you. <3
Amazing
Wow❤ You never disappoint💥
Ren is what it’s all about. I am 71 yrs. Old and you amaze me. Never have heard anyone like you.  True genius.
Poggers
Wow! Ren with another amazing song and music video!
Soo good  goosebumps. Music chefskiss video chefskiss
Hi Ren! This is brilliant bruv. You're a thinker and I love it!
Share the truth brother...   There is FAR more to life than what we see!    We were never meant to be... In the life that deceives.     Life was created to be a magical thrill, not to mature and pay another mans bills.  Minutes into hours and hours into years... We waste away our best F'n years.  The say, they say... Do good today... Go be a a faithful little slave.  Little do they know, that today is not for a slave... It's for a man who knows his way.
Damn…
More metaphorical than women's rights.
Ren you are beautiful
I love this!
Damn
Pure beauty, beauty itself
I've been a fan of yours from the beginning. And have enjoyed all of your songs. But this is about the most powerful one I've heard you do . And the video incredible 😮 wow ! Five thumbs 👍!
Masterpiece❤
🎉
Como que esse cara não é mundialmente conhecido? Eu acompanho ele a um tempo, o cara é um monstro, surreal essa voz.
Too good ❤
Excellent from start to finish , concept to execution,the whole video is masterful and full of "how did they do that"  It's not one I have connected with emotionally but maybe it's a grower for me.  Exceptional job and the run up was marketing wizardry , got my fingers crossed for that number one slot for you as you deserve it so much.
Grazie di cuore
Wow. I don't know what more words to add...except...wow! Commenting to fluff the algorithms testicles.
Wish you the best, Ren. I've seen the jump in subscribers.  Your message is much needed in this time.
Damn! That's some deep stuff
Ren, you're an incredible artist. Please. Never stop. What. A. Masterpiece.
Didn't know Thomas Shelby could sing.
The sheer level of dedication in every aspect is stunning. CHILLS!

Man, how do you keep one upping everything you've done before? It's beyond music, this is high art.
All I can say Ren is thank you and peace young man.  You can change the World.  Keep going. Can't wait for my Ren CD to arrive.
what a master piece
Dude.
Geezus. This moved me as much as "Hello Ren". I am so grateful. 50 years from now, many will wonder what it must have been like to watch Messi play live. Not only do we all have that gift currently, but we have Ren, too. F'n bravo.
hoolly fuck thats a dope circle
❤ Spectacular!
Ren..you are the best 🔥🖤
7:24 ..Divine intervention...❤
Wonderful addition to money game cycle
Never heard of this guy before because I gave up on rap music a long time ago but this is more like poetry.
🔥🔥🔥
Happiness is the serenity and contentment you find in fulfilling the purpose you were created for. That purpose is to worship your creator and care for those around you.
What a raw and unique performance, this is true art.
man got dat thomas shelby cut
I’ve always felt music is so beautiful in many forms…from rock to rap to opera or just instrumental…hearing your creations have made me think about music as a whole in such new & exciting ways….good on ya Ren, keep it going brotha…you are one of a kind…please take a bow & thank you for sharing your soul….
Am I the only one wondering when Lin-Manuel Miranda will be reaching out to see when Ren is going to launch his Broadway show?
This is... P E R F E C T I O N ! ❤❤❤
This song is a true masterpiece, both lyrically and melodically. It captures the essence of emotion in a remarkable way.
Was just introducing a friend yesterday to your music and told them about the two Money Game songs. Crazy how timing works huh? This song is so good! Love your stuff man, Keep at it, your music has such soul to it. Can't wait to see what comes next!
What the fuck dude, you're such a freaking genius. The camera work, the lyrics expressing how badly we are in general with fame and money. Never stop what you're doing, I still on the chill just thinking about what can be next. Keep doing that you way more then a simple game lying on fame. You're simply a talented artist that deserve to be known by everyone.  Thanks again my man, I am so proud to see some one has creative and good delivering such a powerful message of truth right in our face. Hope some of the people you described will recognize how well versed you  paint there lies. Like what you do and I hope that you will still give us those crazy chill when you rime and sing about those way of life.
One of the greatest Storytellers.  Hands Down!
This was perfect.
I don't know how you do what you do. It is very much appreciated ❤
Amazing!! 🤯
Holy sh*t.. blown away 🤯💥🔥
Ren always seems to turn music into his own art and completely change the way I look at music. I love every bit of every second of every song by him <3
Brilliantly done as usual. ❤
Its incredible I herd he did this in just half of a take....😂..I jest I jest...love you REN
I feel so lucky to even have been a spectator of this whole journey 💕 just knowing how many people poured their soul into making this piece of art, thank you all✨
Ren..you r an ultimate artist, tq for your thought provoking beautiful piece of art❤ Kudos to Sam n everyone there that participated in this visual n musical masterpiece
Goosebumps!
Shits unbelievable
Beautiful. Tragic. A magical experience you have given. thank you.
Luigi did teach me well
Loved it, so glad I pre-ordered:P
I can’t say anymore than what has already been said. Wow. I don’t know how you manage to do more each and every time. Ren is just what the world needs right now. I’m at a loss for more to say.
Marvelous!!
Well done, and well said.             "..😎.."            Create!
Impressive.
Genius🤯
Riveting, as always ! Bravo maestro, you've done it again. Mesmerizing and unforgettable 👏
I mean, everyone else has said it. You are an artist, sir. Thank you. Keep it up.
Encore une fois, je suis très ému par cette chanson de Ren. Et la vidéo est magnifique !
Love reaction video because I would have never been introduce to this amazing story teller
another 45 years of curriculum in my life. learning every day
Incredible, simply incredible.
I'm really proud of you, man. I have no other words.
It so funny how at work we were talking all about the things in the song. It funny how the invention of money and borders are enough for people to kill each other for, while centralized government profit off the fear the death.
This one went above and beyond
Wow
The song/video was 1000% worth the wait. Another masterpiece! ❤
Absolutely phenomenal, as soon as the chellos and voilins came in my whole body got the chills, amazing work from you and amazing cinematography from sam 👏👏👏
❤❤❤
Another epic masterpiece of reality!
Like many others who commented, I liked this video and song. I've got nothing else to say except that an ad for paper towels came on after the video was done.
I enjoy your stuff, man. This is like some modern-day Floyd type music. In a way. It is different yet similar because it is cerebral.  I don't care how people feel about Floyd they wrote some cerebral music and were a phenomenal band. Keep up the nice work.
wow.... fucking hell!
wow
Hes right the system needs to change we need to change and learn that we dont need all the stuff that we think. We rush around accumulating wealth but it's the wrong sort of wealth people are more important than the things we own.
I keep listening, over and over. This is amazing!
Yes.......just.......yes.
Awesome
What's there left to say. Awesome as ever. If I could ever tell how your words helped to heal me...   I love you and your music. Please stay with us
Where is Hope, it’s a great portrayal of the empty pursuit of money, power and fame. We need to find purpose outside our selfish ambitions
Art… that’s what this is, this should be what goes viral, what gets exposure, what wins awards and what gives their creators recognition, fame and wealth.  But our media feed us with meaningless stuff to keeps us entertained and distracted while they keep their finger on the trigger.🫣
Amazing as usual man .... Keep the glorious work
Bravo 👏👏
REN? YOU REALLY DID SOMETHING HUGE! these are advises hopefully someday anyone will get, honestly!  GODDAMN, im pleased to discover all those new lines, references and sound patterns. actually just heard it once but im already blown away about everything.  REALLY hard to handle right now, 'cause  its 3AM and im forced NOT to loop it dishonorably and especially out loud.   - so, short said;  ren, a bottom-hearted placed thank you for THIS new born sibling masterpiece of money game part 3! and OF COURSE for all the effort that has it in it, 'cause of you and 'cause of all those who's involved in this. i guess we're all FUCKING GRATEFUL!   ps; its a fucking MASSAKER  -lovely solid days for you everyday, man. PLEASE!
Oh wow!!!
i have to leave another comment, this is just too good
Fucking genius! Love you Ren! ❤
Merely     GENIUS!
Absolutely brilliant. The man keeps proving his genius over and over again. Stand back, world!
Absolutely insane
Goosebumps, Ren... gav3 me goosebumps man
You make me feel as if I'm not the crazy one. Thank you.
Don't really know where to post this so I'll just drop it here. Although I've heard most of the songs already from Sick Boi, it is just absolutely amazing. The songs that were actually new to me are just as great as I'd hoped and knew they would be. Masterfully done. Congratulations Ren. I can't wait to see what you do next. So good!!
I'm 61, and it has been years since a musician has commanded and demanded my attention the way you do. You are undoubtedly the most important musician to come our way in a long, long time. I feel privileged to be here to witness this genius. You are a bright light in the cesspool of pitch corrected and Auto-tuned dreck that the music industry has become. You're an extraordinary musician, and an extraordinary human being. ❤
Such incredible talent, and amazing work. Flawless story telling. Ren’s really made a name from himself, and to think i found him busking on the streets of brighton with The Big Push. And then went to see their last concert as a band. This man has helped so many people through so many different things. His mums a bright star too, met her on the train on the way back home that night. Such a beautiful family. Much love Ren. I hope you see this.
When Ren tells a story, I sit, mesmerized.
🤔
Was there a pig ?
gotta release the lyrics too. . its A Tale of Jimmy too. . submit as a spoken word/poem FOR humanity,  longest poem ever
This is a masterpiece
Incrível e impressionante
Holy dude! Artistic and wordplay! The world is as much ready as your stats show, keep it up🔥❤️
Ren I gave a "like" for the algorithm. I did not like that. Not one bit. Amazing? Yes. Powerful? Yes. Likeable?  Fk no. But spot...fkn...on mate. Thank you.
Dude I just got notified of this I’m not even subbed?

another banger
Who tf is this man?!? And how did the algorithm find me???
Ren that was so brilliant.  Leaves me asking though. What about his mum? Maybe you could create a spin off? Mummy's Game.  The life of what she had to go through. The love at the beginning with the father the happy times then the hardship and tribulations and jimmy coming along and it all falling apart. Great work man keep doing it mate
Ren you are an absolute genius. 🔥🔥🔥
Hard hitting performance art, and truly a great poet.
Mozart would be impressed
A masterpiece. I'm in tears. Thank you for reminding me.
Never disappoints. Ren and Sam killing the music and videography game.
Great art like Ren's comforts in dark times like these and gives hope.
Wowww… just, wow, Ren. You did it again. ❤
Was here at the beginning, even seen the original skit to this song much love bruva. Thank you.
Ren just gets better & better, it’s a travesty he’s not more well known 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Your stuff reminds me of THIS stuff, a little. And I've been listening to THAT stuff since before. I saw them in SF on September 11, 2000... It was a public "call to action". That's why it was on 9/11. Only got to have that festival once but, I was introduced to John Butler Trio and Xavier Rudd. You're special, little brother. Do what you can to enjoy the life you preserve with persistence.  I'm 54 and I have survived 3 heart attacks since I was 41. Stay near good healthcare services (ALWAYS) and do whatever you can to enjoy yourself, besides. Big love and much hugs, little brother. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxYHSZw0-eQ&list=PLG8sRT0nSL_AxaoPKY333xUnkUkz3LHRi
Just went back and rewatched 1 and 2 to refresh myself. So freaking awesome. Dude!!!!
156 I.Q. at 14 (42 now) and I understand more how Tesla fell in love with a pigeon than I do life today. My life will end with a gun blast. Just hopefully not for a while.
Mindbogglingly awesome!
this is a masterpiece you never disappoint.
Dopeness 👏🏿👊🏿💯

A masterpiece 😮
King 🤴
You are a an artistic genuis ren, an absolute legend!!!
🤘
The parasitic way we feed the 1% makes me sick. Greed, power and the game of money will be our downfall. The world needs a reset.   I pray you've lit the touch paper to turn sheep into a wolf pack. 🙏
5:22 Hi Ren
The man is a musical genius, enough said.
great
I tried to kill myself only a week ago, this was a bit much for me.
Like everyone else right here, right now  we see and hear how brilliant Ren is but is the message sinking in???? This is a mirror to ourselves, humanity has evolved so far but look where we are🤯 This world, this universe and most of all WE need to listen and take notice  of his words...... its more than music or art, this is a mirror to our survival and people like Ren are what we need  not all the bull shit we see and listen too. 🫵
The amount of work it took just to get the gun scene right with all the safety measures is f'n impressive!

Straight 🔥🔥🔥🐐

Im so glad i found Ren this year, he is incredible and his work means alot to this desperate soul. Thank you Ren!
Is no one else thinking this is Jenny and screeches dad? Jimmy being James, violets partner at the time….
The video....amazing, the song.....mind blown away!  It's amazing as my fiance and I have been discussing these very issues all year.  It scares me to think that we are going to totally f**k this planet up very soon, but watching and hearing Ren and the people that follow gives me hope.  We all know what needs to change. Ren, you are an incredible artist, but more importantly you are an incredible human being.  I hope that we can, as a worldwide community, get the rest of the world to take notice and take a good hard look at what we've become and where we are heading.  Peace and Love from Australia
WTF ?! You have gold in your hands ! It's a masterpiece !  Keep on going ! Force à toi Ren continue comme ça ^^ la bise de la France
Can't stop watching this video....brilliant is such an understatement for this one! Felt every second of this xx
I am so happy i found your music, Its insane and tells amazing stories... Or real life events... Things we see daily, bringing it to us
This is the video that needs millions of views!
Masterpiece. I have chills and I’ve rewatched it a couple times already to make sure I was seeing everything. And I see new things each time. Attention to detail is so perfect.
Amazing
Soo cringe
The perfect trilogy.
You are a once in a generation artist. This is a staggering piece of work. Nobody else on the planet did anything coming close to as good as this, this year? Any year. Brother. Keep it in free-fall. There is no spoon. Love you so much. ❤
there is literally nobody else like Ren, hes a one of a kind genius!!
Cringeeee
this is simply incredible, i have no words to describe how much i love this music and the video
Once again exceptional

Absolute masterpiece from start to finish, I can't even believe this guy exists
🔥🔥
Will you ever be doing concerts?  Hope you can.  I'm just imagining one of the greatest shows/concerts ever. Broadway meets Ren.
I agree. I'm trying to create a community centered around caregivers. I think caregivers make society.
Utterly amazing masterpiece. Oh, did I mention it is a masterpiece!!!!!!!!
Another masterpiece ! Thank you Ren !
Wow- just wow 🤩
Ren looks like Tommy Shelby  Good luck unseeing this
I been listening. But I finally logged on. Ren is mad talent, but this one reminded me of why I & everyone was caught. Playwriter. Plenty of other boxes he fills. But a writer he is
I mean absolutely amazing BUT as amazing as Ren is credit to Sam like wow this is amazing work. I know Ren's videos are amazing but this one is something different 🙊 made me see the whole thing as a movie so clean and flowing it's beautiful and sad.. these 2 can and will change the music world for the better ❤
Masterpiece 👏👏👏
Stunned and happy to see you evolve! Like a ballet between a storytelling and camera, lyrical brilliance, showmanship, videography out of this world. Thank you Sam & Ren!!!
All my love.
Love this❤❤❤Love everything you do ❤❤❤
Just wow. What a beautiful twist of reality and a masterpiece of the way of life
I can’t stop watching this. It’s fucking art

THE MONEY GAME ENDING YES!!!
Ren's a genius wooooo
This video brought me to tears, something that has rarely happened in the last 3 or so decades. My jaw is still dropped since yesterday. This is profoundly special, I don't know what else to say...
Loving it! Amazing work. I just feel sorry for the lady with her violin that got soaked. She should get a prize for not paniking! 😂❤❤❤
When you were in the wheelchair at the end and it started raining, I started  humming "Oh rain, rain, rain , rain in my head like that was what you wanted your Renegades to join in with!  LOL!!!
I don't have a way to express how brilliant this is that hasn't been said a hundred times in these comments already, so I'm just leaving a comment for the algorithm.
Wow really well shot, and some important messages ❤
WHAT IS THIS MAGIC??
ngl REN could plan joker in batman
A musical genius
Another insightful masterpiece, 👏👏👏
The forefathers of Capitalism even said themsleves that it cannot survive without a moral peoples. After our forefathers died. It immediately fell into the hands of an immoral people's.  The country of America struggled for freedom. And capitalism succeeded morally for a time. Or at least as morally as socialism and communism succeded "for a time". There's bad people in every system who ruin the concept since the system is born.  America is the fastest growing country to ever grace the world. America is also the fastest declining country to ever stain the world..
A little corny at times but this song and story slaps some serious ass
🔥🔥🔥
Have been following this Artist & Big Push since 2018, thought he peaked in 2019 but it seems Ren atleast will be around. Because of us he is able to storytell our mirrors of the inhuman humanity we are
Ren I have only newly discovered you  this week and I have watched your videos and the big push videos and you have blown my mind and you and Samuel make some of the best videos ever to date and I am hooked , I wish you the very best bruh oh I haven't brought an album in like 10 years until today and you made that happen
Tracig? Yes. True? Perhaps. I guess I'm lucky because I find myself profoundly disagreeing with the sentiment of this song. (English not my 1st language and wieved this wasted after a night out) But still love the work Ren is doing.
Beyond amazing. Found your busking videos with the big push a couple of years ago, and have been hooked on all your work since. Amazingly talented. Nothing like you out there at the moment.
One of the best in the world right now, great job my dude.
Well. Shit balls. This is damn near perfect.
This is pure art, absolutely amazing thank you Ren for all your work and effort that you put in your masterpieces
😊
I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS GONNA BE A PART 3
Ren Ren Ren......wow just wow .
We all needed this, pls continue with your amazing work ❤❤❤❤
Amazing as always Ren!!!!
striking!
🤗
Ren, your speaking the subconsious of our minds, and your right about that, life is a game......  anything we desire ends up nothing when we are on our finish line
Ren.
Danm . All I can say is danm
Yes I luv this! Why doesn't it have more likes?
Genius!
🔥🔥🔥
Bump!
I'm 50 years old, for the past x months I've cried tears and tears listening to your stories through unprecedented performances... what you, Ren, and your team are doing to me is somehow resetting myself, therapy (if I can say so) on a daily basis. Without going on too long, I can say that you make me better, more sensitive, more humble in front of all that and those who make up my life. Deep bow and respect to Ren and your loved ones who supported you and continue to do so...
Perfect
This is amazing! Very impressed.  Got that childish gambino "this is America" Vibe.  That ending was deep.
THAT REALLY WAS A MASTERPIECE
From La Habana, Cuba... With two days left until my 50th birthday, I guess I can take this as one of the best early gifts I've ever received. Blessings and lots of light for the future, the world needs you!
Visually - stunning, verbally - brilliant, musically - inspirational, message - disturbingly truthful. I loved every second of it, thank you!
lets break a pack of shrooms and enjoy this trilogy thx ren and sam
What a story to tell!! And in a such a way.. Thank You, Ren, You're inspiration and hard thinking wise man. When you think as much it give you goosebumps. No pop or show elements needed, jus a heart open, mind open and it's enough breath taking and so heartwarming to watch/listen. Thanks!
Omg this is my new favorite song by you! My son, who's 7, listened to it before i did and he understood 💯 the meaning behind the lyrics, he told me "Momma, i don't want an empty mansion, id rather have a small home filled with love" I'm so proud of him for realizing that at such a young age, and I'm so proud of his taste in music 💙💜🥰 Thank you,  Ren
Truth! love it
Always speaking how it is and loving every single bit of it, it's  not entertainment he does but poetry of music and lyric... top man!
This biscuits is awesome!!!
This is exactly what I need right now. The beauty of being successful and young, the beauty of having it all "money, love and fortune".                                                   And then...the downfall.. losing love, struggling with addiction and just dealing with being who you became... Thanks Ren, I have been your fan for 5 years now... And you always brought me to my senses. Hope one day I can meet you in person.  Love from Slovakia.
Thrilling Troubadour skills! Ren, you are are a ‚romantic Vielbegabung‘! ❤😅
@nolifeshaq where you at with this one fam!!
Sheezus, man. Goosebumps, every goddam time ✌🏻👑
Damn, simply Damn.
This guy called Ren....SMH !🎉
I just thought about you and there is a new song ! Truly incredible
Message.
In terms of music video and production it's by far the best I have seen from Ren so far. I like his views about the world and his art in general. Regarding the music part of this song there were a couple of things that I didn't like that much. First the intro sounds very similar to Violet's tale intro. Second, I found the counting part of the song a bit boring and hard to follow. For me it would be better this part to be compressed to half.  Other than that a great delivery as always.
Fuck...😮
Algorithm boost, this is incredible.
Wow
So powerful. Chills!
Has the album got into the charts?
I love your art!!
if thomas shelby was a musician lol
I love the little hint of Violet's aria leading into the chorus melody. History repeats itself.
❤ wow just wow..
Like many I’m sure, “Hi Ren” pops up for suggested YouTube videos, I listen/watch, and I’m hooked. Drilled through Ren’s entire catalog during that week. So F’ing raw and authentic. Kind of put my cynicism of new music in check. Several songs bring me to tears no matter how many times I listen to them. I’m excited for a new album and it will be the first album I’ve actually bought in 20+ years. I just want to support this kind of talent. Songs like Dominoes, Diazepam, Chalk Outlines, and Blind Eyed will NEVER get old to me. P.S. Like Ren, John Frusciante is one of my all time favorite guitarists as well. If anybody hasn’t heard any of his solo stuff or even the work he did with the chili peppers… strongly suggest 😁
wow
Ren coming in with another masterpiece
Just the opening, playing piano like that, partially blindfolded by a sack on your head is blowing my tiny mind. Then I hear so many links to the Money Game 3 challenge ‘follow the code’ ‘cookie jar’ blows my mind a bit more. And just completely insane to hear that this was recorded in only 2 takes! TWO! Serious skills
Makes you wonder, if the silent majority, with a strong moral compass found a united voice and drowned out the extremists how would our world be? Be it religion or politics, acceptance and understanding, with a calm rational debate. Could we make a better future for the next generation? We could, but will we raise our silent voices above the din of the establishment, unfortunately I doubt it. How many more Jimmys will there be in this century?
💯
Bravo, Ren! Not yet 45 but getting closer, bit by bit... not a long way to go, but every year that brings me closer feels more tormented and pointless than the last one. We are all playing this money game that is rigged from the get-go, and we will all lose in the end, but we are tangled up in it without a clear way out. I don't have a 45cal, but it's sometimes difficult to decide whether I should exit my 7th-floor apartment through the doors or the window, because the window feels like the only real way out.
The only other song ive ever drifted off into contemplative thought to like this is "November rain". This masterpiece is right up there with it. Surpassing it. The message is so important. Sorry, just wanted to add that
Wow, masterpiece
Brilliant ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Am I the only one that is hearing/feeling James Bond stylings in the early part of this (up to about age 18)?!?
A masterpiece!
putting on your 'bard' hat - interested in what you think about this piece of music - it was found printed on the butt of one of the tortured souls in the 15th Century Hieronymus Bosch painting "The Garden of Earthly Delights" , Played on (What else?) Lute, Harp, and Hurdy-Gurdy by James Spalink. The melody is based on the transcription by Amelia Hamrick. The intro and outro employ the "Devil's Interval" tritone, which you famously employed on 'Hi Ren'....   for Bosch, this is a now discovered 'music that I left behind'...     Bard On !    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnrICy3Bc2U
Made another comment in a more serious vein but I wanted to ask - am I dreaming or was there not a callback to his “King Dotta dis”? “You’re losing the race, you’re just serving the king”, with the same cadence, yes?   I’ve never been a Hip Hop guy so I could be way off but seems like even something this serious the man still tips his hat to it.  Regardless there’s seemingly no end to the brilliance in this guys mind.   Mad respect.
Wicked ways blowed my mind
I think you'd murder on broadway.
I friggin adore that he ended this with Hope.❤❤❤ As Dom over at That Singer noticed as well. Jimmy may have spiritualy saved himself. As well as Ren may experience, when you make peace with death we are then able to see. ☯️
damn
The more I listen to mg3 the more I pick up. It's genius.  I love your message
Not artsy yet but i liked the first two better and this is something i can only listen to when i am in the right mood. Still keep on you great work and vision Ren, you are one of the best :)
Amazing
Wow. Amazing. What else can I say. Love you Ren, you've restored my hope in humanity.
Lov U
Storytelling in its purest form
Brilliant! Another Masterpiece on the level of "Hi Ren" maybe better!
Holy god I love your new album, thanks!
This hits hard
We finally find out about the child with his finger in of a money game
bro that's a masterpieace!!! LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT!!!
Mate….your a perfectionist! I’m currently 4 hours and counting into your music. Congratulations sir you have another fan
Ren,absolute master piece. This is gonna sound mad but I feel like theres a large portion of people which your music would touch and speak to.People that dont have access to the Internet... so I am determined to get it to them. This is an absolute work of art. Ya big agnostic mason you 😌😂
cool!!!!
Пушка брат. Как всегда на высоте 🤩
Another awesome video!
As always, brilliant
Holy shit that was heavy. REN with another one for the win. so good
Oh shiiiiiitt
Poor Jimmy.....
this is like a dark musical that i actually love watching. its so entertaining but so much truth behind the lyrics or as some might say these are straight bars.  pure genius!!!!!!
Beautiful  masterpiece of are sad reality
I wish I could leave so much more likes. Such a labour of love
👏👏👏
Why do you do me like this. Pain, with love.
Well Ren you were so excited to share this with the world and now we see why! Wonderfully written and filmed, and hopefully it makes people think and help make things better. 👏
❤
Dude....
6.20 And the perspective evolves!  Absolutely love the shot!
@Ren this is pure art
How is it that whenever I watch Ren's works of genius for the first time I am impressed. However when I watch them again and again I become more and more blown away by the whole experience! Maybe my brain just isn't capable of taking it in initially? The more I watch the more I appreciate the layers of genius... Enough said, take a deep bow Ren.
i just found your work with this song , this is'nt just music , its art . there are no many left who can make you feel such emotions with their work ! thank you and please dont stop
❤

It is important to earn money in a moral way. It's important to have integrity and not mistreat others. It's important to treat people like humans. The legendary entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk said how you make your money is more important than how much money you make. It is possible to be a good person with financial abundance. If you only care about money, then you will be miserable.
Damn this dude is blowing up and it’s only gonna get bigger from here. Congrats man! You deserve this enjoy!
This was my favorite part of the series. So well done. Love love love
45...@45...w/ a 45...that number is not lost on us in the 'land of the free.' Ren, beyond your incomparable talent lies a bravery few possess. You guys nailed it once again shooting straight for the heart of the issue. Bravo, man.  Bravo!
This is incredible and so thought provoking. fantastic and loved loved loved the strings
I have something to say, but it's really not easy. Just the thought, deep down, makes me feel a bit queasy. I'm being honest when I say this kind of makes me feel sick, boi... but I hope it turns out that this video makes Ren ironically rich, boi.  Not for the sake of money, though I'm sure he could use it. But mostly 'cause it means that millions of people would have viewed it. This message must be seen, the message must be heard. CLICK LIKE AND SHARE people, by all means spread the word.  It will take a million voices if we're to ever see a change. And I might be deranged but I also think it's time to rearrange and interrupt the game or else it's the same and the same and the same all again...  Approximately 99 percent of us feel that the system is flawed. Ren has sounded the horn, now how do we answer the call? Now I must admit that I don't have the solution. All I know is that we all know that it's time for revolution.  So scream it from your rooftops, your laptops, make them hear your shouts. And put your collective minds together so we can figure something out. A single raindrop isn't scary, and Ren alone can't bring reform. But gather all of us together and we can make them feel the storm.  Let it rain, rain, rain rain...  McMIII
Masterpiece.
Another misconception that one's success and subsequent wealth means there is less for others.  Wealth creates more wealth, at least in a capitalistic economy.  Its not like there a single pizza and if I take two slices instead of one someone goes hungry.  Especially in America, you are what you strive to be.  Sometime you have start farther back but you can reach your goals.  Are there bad actors out there, certainly. Some act in ways that hurt others for many reasons.  But many who reach the top are huge donors to many charities that help those who are struggling.  But what do the reports cover those stories?  Rarely, they would rather cover or uncover scandals and misdeeds at that gets people to tune in their channel and increase the channel's ratings.  But if want a different feed, we need to tune out on stories of others miseries or misdeeds and focus on the positive.  And now we have those channels via social media and streaming services.  You have a choice, don't waste it.
Honestly there are important  short film expositions that I’d enter this in without a second thought. It’s brilliant, in every aspect. Congrats guys!  Ren I want to thank you specifically for the Petri Dish reference - I’ve been getting weird looks from people for a long time talking about our spherical Petri Dish in space. You have no idea how gratifying it is to have at least one other person get it.   I also want to mention Sir Ken Robinson’s famous (20 mil views) TED Talk on our education systems. I recommend it if you haven’t seen it. He’d have loved your work I suspect.   Thanks for what you do man, breath of fresh air.  ✌🏻🙏🏻
We're so back.
MASTERPIECE. THIS IS GREAT ART.
Ren this is incredible art. Thankyou for sharing with the world
TO DATE, THIS IS YOUR MASTERPIECE:! At last you've responded to MONEY GAME part one: Visually, it's a hell of a sequence shot. And now it's more than obvious: there's the words, there's the flow, and of course there's the voice! And what reinforces it all is THE INTERPRETATION!  All the power you put into the way you shout out your thoughts, the way you move, the expressions on your face, the passion with which you make us feel what you're living inside! You're an incredible performer! A real impressive music/actor.  That's why I'd really like to know if you have any tour dates, because even if you don't come in France, I'll make the trip to come and see you live in UK.
Fucking brilliant!
Good lord he delivers alright!
Just genius
Never have I hung on every moment and utterly transfixed on what was unfolding before me...🌌🙏🏼🌌
WOW!!
I'm continually amazed by your talent. I've never encountered an artist so genuine, talented, and focused on meaningful subjects with exceptional storytelling. Ren, you're the best. Keep up the great work! I first discovered your music when you released "Hi Ren." I was speechless, watched the video two more times, and immediately called my brother, telling him he had to watch it with me. We were both in awe of your talent. Your determination in the face of adversity is truly inspiring. You're an inspiration to all of us. And yes, we're all part of this money game.
Ren, everything you do is art, you are trully unique. Masterful and brilliant filmaking from Samuel.
Well done! The superlatives are lining up in my brain at the moment but I think, a simple standing clap might be more appropriate.  Jusy one final thing: fuck the money game!  CHEERS!
Ele fez mais uma vez é inacreditável
I just cannot get enough.. Thank you for every masterpiece Ren
LESGOOOOOO!!!!!!
keep preachin brotha people are listening!!! to the top!
Masterpiece. F*cking incredible.
money game part 2 is one of my favourites, but this might just overtake it.
Wunderbar🤩🤩🤩
This is one of the best vids and songs of 2023 for real. The visuals, the substance, storytelling, bars, beat, etc are on point.
this is next level, i loved part 2. but this is beyond that
C'est un chef-d'oeuvre!!!
Amazing, haunting, riveting, breathtaking, I'm speechless❤ incredible work !!!!
10/13 1:09 pm PST  #31 on trending!!!!!! had to watch again! congrats Ren! les get the whole album on here! ♥️🎶🙏🎶♥️
I genuinely think that you are one of the greatest artists of our time. It also applies to you Samuel!  It's not the visuals, not the melody, nor the lyrics.  It's not the theatrics, story-telling or philosophy of it all.  It's the entire thing.  It's your ability to create a 10 minute opera, to combine 6 art-forms into one, to summarise such complex debates so simply. It's your ability to operate without judgement.  Thank you from the bottom of my stuttering soul.  Thank you for saying so eloquently what so many feel.  Thank you for doing it again and again.   I'll never find the words so I'll end here but know there's no end to my gratefulness and admiration.
😍😁
Dude I was at work today and recieveď an email informing me my pre order of sick boi was on its way made my day
✊️🖤
rollercoaster of emotions, you're an amazing artist x
I have ADHD. Never looked away once, didn't notice that the video had passed. Awesome work.
Amazing!
Through yesterday's treasure hunt, the MG3 release and the Twitch stream I really had all possible emotions,  excitement  , happiness, anger, calming down, emotional exhaustion...after all , this roller-coaster of emotions ended in love for the whole project and all the people involved. ❤ Thank you for challenging me....lesson learned!
GOD DAMN!
i am... speechless
❤❤❤❤❤
Incredible intellectuality, sharpness, musical and audovisual experience with extremely deep and brutally honest meaning. Every second of this is its own piece of art. Thank you for this incredible experience, the whole humanity can learn a lot from it.
Fucking gem as always
it must have like unsubbed me bro i stg i know i must have subbed before... i know i did.... and now here i am re subbing.. when i know that i love this guy, and wanna support how ever i can.. ofcourse i subbed.. but.. i wouldn't ever unsub... thats really weird man...
Unbelieveable. Again and again and again. The only musician today who really speaks to the people.
Such a sick video
Another part of that masterpiece. Thank you so much Ren
Outstanding! Also, bought the Album today (digital) and just wanted to say you should've charged $9.99 for it as I would gladly have paid that.
TT brought me here😱
Genius
45, damn. Good work Ren.
when you finally have the vision of everything being the same...millions of dollars or not, i'll continue praying and remain humble <3 im mid 20s and still feel like im 15 :) in my mind, and it wasnt always like that, things can change you must adapt. and humble your souls!! damn satanists
FINNALY!!!!! I'm so excited this dropped!
That hits me hard. It's sad but beautiful.
Ren is the crossroads where talent meets moral conscience. Pure, beautiful, perspective.
Amazing! 🔥🔥🔥
the ooo,oooo,oooos, are the funnest thing to do while singing i swear <3
Oh my… it happened again. Clicked on a Ren video while cooking dinner and now I spend the whole night watching…. LOVE IT!
Wow💜
I'm here to say I love your brain
Amazing
Everything about you Ren is amazing and inspiring. You are truly something different and a great role model in a world that is sick. I need you, my wife needs you. The world needs you. You are the best ❤
You are absolutely right, Ren.  Your insight is invaluable.
Maestro
absolute brilliance
Waiting for it.❤
Ren is the kind of treasure that i don't want to recommend to anyone at the same times i think everyone should listen to this piece of artಥ⁠‿⁠ಥ
Great Track!
Nearly half a mil views in a day. For an independent artist. Tells you all you need to know. 💰👊
Blown away. Again. You are leaving a noticeable mark on this Earth and it's a fucking delight to be on this ride.
I have a really good coment but I'm going to burry it on an island until there's nothing left to desire! this whole build up to a gran finally is pure! @renmakeshistory Peace!
Another astonishing piece of art.
I'm not easily impressed but Ren you fucking killed this. I ripped it . Keep doing you Ren. you deserve this more than any other artist I follow. Goosebumps mate fucking love this
If this was a cinema movie (and it kind of is) it would win the Oscar in EVERY single category.
Speachless
Ren i love how you're not afraid to talk about subjects like these, hard truths, things people need to hear
Great song
Excellent ❤🎉
Woah. Mind...blown, he's the one of the few artists that out does himself all the time.
Very good keep it up Ren
One word..... INCREDIBLE!
🔥🔥🔥 as per ❤️✌️
Each money game song is even better than the previous one, love it
The effects and editing of your videos are great.
YouTube Ads recommended this to me, surprisingly it didn't disappoint. This one 🔥fr. There's nothing like real rap.
I think the most underappreciated thing in this music video is the logistics. This was a TWO TAKES VIDEO. TWO TAKES!! This is absolutely mindblowing and immensely complex to do. Massive props to the people involved!!
Lol. Whats this? Did I Miss somerhing? Bis far the worst of the great Work before. 😓
This is a masterpiece.
fuck you,Ren, for making me feel mortal and making me cry. every damn time you put out a new video! your music is beyond anything else, keep it up!
Wow. Speechless.
That was vicious!!
Apart from this being an amazing song, the video is insane. One take (again) and every time you watch it you see something else. Took me three watches to get how they did the loosened tie/shirt. Album is soooooo good too.
Dude....WTF...INCREDIBLE
Amazing
Is the sound recorded live? Sure seems like it to me.
this is... spectacular.
I subscribed to ren around 4 years ago and he never stops getting better and better even when you think he can't he pulls out something like this, a master at work.
Next level... again.
This is exceptional
this needs to be viral
Love it! Why the nod to violets tale near the start? Was it just aa musicality decision? Or deeper meaning? Is Jimmy James/screech in an alternate world? Or showing the struggles of human beings on either end of the social hierarchy, Jimmy on one end and violet on the other in terms of finance and power? Contrast between violet who fights to stay alive and Jimmy who decides it isn't worth it any more?
Shiiiitttt 👀 this is a whirlwind of emotions!
MASTAHPIECE, BABYYYYYYYYYYYYYY NOT EVEN KNACK CAN HANDLE IT
I love this so much! Its so good
I just occasionally come here and leave comments. I understand that no one reads them, but if it really helps to promote the video, then I will try to continue writing them
I’m so fucking obsessed. Ren is everything, pure genius, pure heart, a reflection of my soul.
❤🎉 #masterpiece
❤❤❤
Class, i'm glad i'm 46
Genius
In many words that is being said, I just hope the words and actions follow on with my children and not make a wrong turn. I just want to do right my my kids.
This guy is amazingly talented!! I just found and can't stop listening.
Ren blurs the lines between music and artistic poetry love it
Damn! Such a brilliant way to speak about such important issues. Such beautifully put truth in the bars, the nitty gritty of what's going wrong placed together in such a riveting way. I love your music Ren, thank you for continuing to grace us with it!
Da iawn boyo
The more I listen the more I really want a classical composition of all the pieces in this as they just weren't long enough. From piano to strings to vocalisation. Beautiful, just beautiful.
He is a genius  This is a masterpiece
This sucks you in that much that you at least forget to breathe. 🤯
This is another excellent production, Ren. I can't put to words all the ways I appreciate your music (and through it, you I would imagine). Thank you for all the put out there. <3
The details in this are incredible…took me a couple of views to realise that the simultaneous globe and camera spin is when Ren becomes the loosened jimmy - dishevelled tie etc. Such an awesome piece
Breathtakingly beautiful and real 🤍
Masterpiece as always
Creative genius at work! Amazing
Always gets better, just wow
It's a flex that I was alive the same time as Ren
Almost 500k views in 24 hours. Well done lads.
A masterpiece in every way. Even the premiere countdown sequence... i could chill out to that any time !
Flooding your comments with ❤❤❤ to boost the algorithm.  Masterpiece ❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💪💪💪
Amazing job everybody!
Absolutely phenomenal
That panio tho
Love it
More algorithm potatoes 🥔🥔🥔
Thank you.
Just wow ....
Solutions
I've gone back to watching Reaction videos for Pt. 3 - why, who, what is this. One REN to rule them ALL ?? I just don't know anymore
Wow. Dieses Stück ist unfassbar. Wow.
So true and powerful, masterpiece again but mate, PLEASE! I need a (much;) longer instrumental Version from the orchestra part! This is so good! Love you man 😘
❤❤
Thank you, Ren.
This seems like the pinnacle of one-shot delivery. Content that enraptures, and then delivers a message - a message that strikes the nerve of now, a zeitgeist if you will. I hope your reach hands you enough momentum to move the needle. The world needs to evolve in the direction you are pushing it. Godspeed.
🎯🚀🌠
It’s amazing seeing far you’ve come First heard the full album on Apple Music and this was  shocking Now the video makes the storytelling even deeper
really a masterpiece man
Keep grinding Ren. Congratulations on all your successes. You deserve it all. Loved this song!
masterpiece... truly humbled by your talent.
google magnum opus
Absolutely gorgeous. I love everything you put out but this has such a beautiful feeling to it. Thank you for your gift Ren. It truly is a work of art that speaks to so many.
Thanks for the healing tears Ren. I couldn't post this while watching, I had to take it all in. You're saving a life every day here. Your 434th fan.
damn we need more people like you ..... R E S P E C T.

True Art ❤
Absolute perfection; the way you capture the unspoken words in silence is astounding.
Man, rarely you see and hear something like this. Art.
Holy shit Ren, what an addition to the insane body of work you have. I shared your music with my 66 year old dad a few months ago who instantly was in awe. He just had to show his mates right away. It would be so easy to come off as pretentious with the topics you tackle but the sincerity that comes across can't be denied. I've watched the early, simpler videos over and over again and loved them, but its amazing seeing where you and your crew are taking things now you seem to be have more resources. <3
Wow, this is outstanding!! You are an amazing talent Ren! Calling out the ludicrous money game...that just takes lives.
My wife and I love your music Ren.  You're such a talented artist!!
thank you
Fuckng brilliant. Beautiful. Meaningful. I’m in awe and you’re amazing and I feel like you’re truly just a beautiful soul. Most ppl are about as deep as a puddle, I grow more and more sad at the state of things. Finding you and listening to what you create fills the devastatingly empty abyss I’ve felt whilst thinking there just weren’t things as beautiful as what you create still being made these days. Thank you, truly.
Another masterpiece. Thank you Ren ❤
THE TRILOGY
Class. This kid pisses me off 😂, he's too good as a musician at his age. I'm 40 and still struggle with guitar and singing at the same time. Playing the piano as well as he plays guitar too?!? JESUS, mary and Joseph dude cmon!!! Fkn well done!!! Great msg, great music. Cheers to you Ren.
My man you were born to blow us away, just mesmerizing.
One more masterpiece from Ren
Younger People: here is A Poet for your Lifetime. Protect him. Protect @Chinchilla Protect @ParisPaloma   Please add to this list of artists you feel should be elevated and protected if you want.   I am a senior citizen and am no where close by to what inspires the young. ❤This is Your List❤ Hold tight to the people who write and sing and create to inspire you or keep you going. I have been waiting since the 1970’s for music to be meaningful again. I am grateful for @REN
Got to give it up to Sam. Just watch with the sound off and imagine planning & execution of the camera work.
7th in the trending chart. Fabulous. Get that message out there!
The cinematography alone in the video is beyond stellar. everything about this pulls you in and leaves you wanting more
This is bonkers!
This is stunning.
❤
20th time watching right now
15 year old me and my mates, “that was Ace” 65 year old me “hair envy and maybe the Face”
This is pure talent ❤
At the end of 45,when is rain and stuff I can feel The Rise ❤❤❤
Ren is the bard we need in this world, giving us tales woven in vision. Between him and Sam, it's one masterpiece after another, one so much better than the last.
I'm lost for words this is 🔥
This performance makes sad and it makes cry. Because it's the ugly truth about greed seeping it's way into our minds and our hearts. The butcher of a silk button 😢
Muy bien!! This is amazing.
Jimmy was "Dragggged down by the stooonne".......if you know, you know.....
What! A! Banger! ❤!
that 9 minutes just flew by seemed like only a few, lost in the story
Was just wandering and watching sea shells meme, went and checked the official mv and suddenly saw that part 3 is out  coincidence is a scary thing
This is freaking insane. Wow, just when you thought you seen the best of Ren this happens.
Absolutely 🔥🔥 as always!!
We as people, as Humankind should listen to these wise words! Out of this world Artist!!🙌
Hey Ren, The video is gorgeous. The choreography, acting, music, lighting, camera work, iconography, it's just superb.  The message is one I wish more music would share. It seems a lot of it preaches the opposite. Consume, take, never give, never share. Your art is meaningful to so many people. You're changing the world for the better, one mind at a time.
"My solution.....". I don't think that Ren believes that the solution is that we all commit suicide. So, what is he saying with his beautiful, tragic and haunting art? Is it in the vicinity of "dying to self(ishness)," "denying self," ...?
capolavoro Ren lo fa di nuovo 👏 Grande rispetto per lui 🙏
I've listened to this so many times today already and watched a few reaction videos. I love how everyone has their own interpretation and unique thoughts.  It's a work of art and Sam's camera work is something else 🥰
EPIC = ART at its FINEST!!!!
YES! YES!! YESSS!!! I AN LOVING THIS!!!!
Thank you ❤
When I started to watch I got totally mesmerized. This song is like the peak of aristry. And when the violin part started I felt like I can feel Ren's soul in the  music, almost cried.. The depth of his music is insane..words cannot even describe it.. All the love to you Ren
A story about corruption ..of minds 🔥
speechless once again. This is art
Incredible song, great videography by Sam, YouTube algorithm will hate it, feck them...
At this point,this is beyond music.This is art and facts...
9 mins passed? Tried not to spill a word and didn't notice.
I think you have a No 1 album in the UK...please someone confirm?!
Awesome!!
Brilliant. I'm a 66 year old who finds you amazing. Thank you for all you do and say. I hope through your words some eyes will be opened. Thank you again. ❤
Stunned… wow just breath taking This is a theatrical masterpiece at its pinnacle. Hard hitting truth telling in the guise of entertainment. Ren you and Sam are astounding in your artistry. ❤ In all my 61 years I can’t remember being this impressed! ❤
Absolute banger.
Incredible
This is not just a song! Its felt like a whole movie! One of Ren's best work in my oppinion
Brilliant
So much talent, it's amazing I didn't discover you until a few days ago.  You got another fan.  masterful storytelling
I know I will eventually see a movie directed by ren and when the screen goes black at the end I will scream " Goddamn it that was great!" Like I did just moment ago
Ayeeee
I love it when art is a prophetic voice to society. And I love how Ren encourages us to take responsibility for our part in The Money Game. But that begs the question of what it means for me to take responsibility for my part. I don't think the answer is about economic systems. Greed and Conquest destroy people in all economic systems. And not making a living isn't the answer.   I think the answers are in line with "do nothing out of selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility value others above myself, not looking out just for myself, but for the interests of others as well," and "let me not seek only my own good, but that of my neighbor," and "love my neighbor as myself".
Where to start, I've been watching this masterpiece since yesterday and the more times I see it, the more words I run out of to describe not only the piece itself but also how it makes me feel. I've been following the releases over the last few months and the craftsmanship of everyone involved is simply superb. Congratulations.
Loved that part at 6mins in, touching
Tears in my eyes at all the lost,due to isolation and competition instead of love and community. This week showed us what could be  accomplished by cooperation, focus and caring about balance and progress for ALL of the hive.
Excalibur level EXCELLENCE
Love it brother keep up the amazing work
Mr shelby has a awesome gift. Love you ren ❤
Master classs😮😮😮
Why did i just now find your music... This is a real masterpiece! 🔥
Masterpiece. And i got schooled by my 4 year old when watching(rest assured, she doesnt speak english and i stopped when tbe gun cam in play)  However, she suddenly said: Daddy, Ren is trapped !  I asked her why ofc. Her reply:  There are no doors ❤  Really gave me a new perspective. Being trapped from birth to death. And how to escape 🤔
There's artists who's work I enjoy. Then there's artists who's work changes the way I view the world.   Ren, your sickness was a blessing. You are a blessing.
at the end if he sang the chorus: rain rain rain a storm it comes our way again ive wouldve gone mad!
As a 71 year old, im pretty hard to impress anymore. But this young man has blown me away! Im so grateful to be alive to witness the sucess of such an amazing artist as Ren! People with his talent are getting rare these days. We are blessed to have him! ❤❤❤
nice story
Everything you say after  seeing this  would not be worth even a penny
Times are tough right now man, I needed this. Because aside from worrying about finding any kind of decent job I'm happy with everything else in my life. Worrying about jobs and money shouldn't be enough to make me feel like a failure.
Modern day Charlie Chaplin. Ĺol 🎉
The cinematography, The music, The story! Another absolute masterpiece!
Can't work out whether Ren is a singer, a poet, an actor, a rapper, a guitarist, a songwriter or just a genius.
F*kin A!
Besides being a stunning song, this is also a literal cinematic masterpiece. Ren's an amazing artist. Never stop making music!
This is seriously some of your most amazing work  - which was already hard to top everything else you've done!!
Ren did it and deserve it we need a lot more human like you to make real change happen  in this crazy sick world !!! Cant thank you enough man your legend WOWWW what great song cherry on top of the best album of all time !!! Love yall
Ren blows my f****ng mind !! Raw TALENT  at his finest ⭐️🌟
I hope this mirror makes a difference! I loved every meticulously crafted moment! Keep holding up the mirror,  and perhaps one day, we will be proud of the reflection.
A second masterpiece that lasts 9:20, keep it up until you reach 920 of them
Eccentricity & Excellence achieved. A masterclass from all involved 👏
Please comment every 2 days i need 2 remember this
Amazing art. The decline of our corrupt systems is so obviously for those willing and able to see the signs.
❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤
Love it
Pure art
Amazing yet again ❤
commenting for the algorithm!!! this needs to be seen literally everywhere. fucking incredible work as always, from everyone involved. ren you're a visionary.
Bravo! 🎉 what a spiritual journey this was. Thank you thank you thank you
Congratulations to everyone in this video! What an epic masterpiece! ❤
Plans for having all versions of your music in high fidelity for download? Got the album, love it! I want to listen to more especially the live recordings like this version at that fidelity.
Fucking fire once again❤
Where is Luigi?
REN REN REN how the hell do you ever top this.
Another work of genius, phenomenal on every level 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Like the direction... should try get Scorsese or Tarantino to give input for a vid, will be expensive but great collab.
Bro I appreciate your artwork but WHERE THE FUCK IS YOUR COMMON SENSE!?!????. That 45acp out of that 1911 will remove the back of your camera man’s head! Your finger is on the trigger, and while you did not rack the slide or draw the hammer you are being reckless. Did you not see what happened on the set of Rust? Don’t kill your cameramen people.
I have been thinking about this for a couple hours now. This is what I think my mind has decided to learn from it:  Corruption begins from what we teach each other. We have a choice both in what we teach and what we take to heart. And, all along the way, there are ways off the merry-go-round.  It is within our power to act as a force that sees corruption as the destructive cycle it is and to help others do the same. Or, we can choose the path we are on.
Can I just acknowledge that he has over 1M subs and less than half have seen this? Like the JK BROS say, "I'm gonna start clocking ppl out bro"....  I'm in love with this man all over again. And that suit.....and the vocals in beginning with the piano.....very Bond of you dear boy.
Excellent, magnificent 👌👌
Oh my x
I am now stuck in an endless loop of watching reactors watching this and it is still as EPIC as the 1st time seeing it 😍 pure brilliance on all levels!
ren does ren things again a masterpiece as usual keep up the amazing work dude i cant wait for you to take over the world with your music
props to camera man! love this masterpiece
Amazing...
Great work as always, Ren. 🔥🖤
Tu es mon artiste favori !
Rushed home for another listen.
I wonder if ren should take the mantle of the Joker, you can't replace Heath but I believe ren can make it his .......
How can he keep getting better? There are laws of physics being broken here I'm sure.
Your words take my breath away!!!!!
I sit here, a woman in a 65 year old body, shouting at my laptop "Brilliant, fucking brilliant Ren!" When reading your community, I see a lot of people my age really digging your art .. that's not an easy thing to do, to speak to both young & old. You're an old soul I guess ... and pain matures. Much love from one stranger to another Ren. 💕 Thank you for your service (of bringing great music into this world)
Wow. Possibly my favourite song of the year!
This is good
one word > "Incredible"
Another masterpiece!  Anything that you and Sam create is nothing short of brilliant!  Music is a staple for my mental health and sanity.  With that being said, I'm not sure how I managed my day-to-day life without knowing that your music existed.  Very happy and grateful that I randomly clicked on your "HI REN" video 2 or 3 months ago.  Can I just say in regards to the art that you create; GIMMIE! GIMMIE! GIMMIE! MORE! MORE! MORE!  Thank you for providing us this thought-provoking masterpiece!
Wow 😮
this is making the apple top charts fr
My good god, this is not of this world. Chillingly good.
Omaga, cant believe
We're dead already, head in a cheesecloth, how the drowneds heads were covered, dragged out of the river - suicide singing siren songs. Melancholy madness man.
Leaving comment for algorithms.
Shit. That was.. fuckin hell.
Bruh at this point its not music. Its something of its own kind. Its a masterpiece of art.
A person gifted with profound moral insight and exceptional powers of expression.
nobody else doing it like this i love the creativity so much
Im definitely in love with that
We need to give this masterpiece lots of views and comments, not only likes to help the algorythm people!
leaving a comment for the algorim. Thanks for making an amazing and clever master piece
What a masterpiece !!
Masterpiece.
goosebumps
I love the entire video….until the end. I find the ending to be somewhat disturbing. I get it, but I don’t like it. Sorry.
YOOOOOO
Pure brilliance, light worker! Let your light shine.
Unbelievable gift! I am thankful for your heart... your work.
Bravo REN
Slatted floors? They cleaned all the shit that flowed through this to shoot the video? Even if it already wasn't in use anymore, amazing!
My biggest problem with this.... is that I'll never be able to experience it for that first time again. It's absolutely astonishing.
Such an incredible piece of art in all areas. What a masterpiece.
I only discovered you yesterday. I'm totally captured by your storytelling, your beautiful cinematography, and of course your amazing songs.
Gotta ask, was that a sly little nod to Sid in the vocal delivery on the 'Po-Po in his pocket' line?
I'll say just this: "This is ART!"
JFC... You deserve to be #1   Bravo 👏👏
❤️
I haven’t found any reactors yet that recognised the quote from Griegs piano concerto in A minor at the start.   Where are all the classical musicians in this community?! I’m sure I’m not the only one…
Ren, did you listen to Plan b growing up? amazing.
Peaky blinders new level 😮👌
How can this last nearly 10 mins, I swear it was over in a flash. Masterfull
This man is a genius..😯💯👏👏👏
YEEAAAHHHH
❤💯❤💥❤🔥
I'm absolutely blown away. This is a masterpiece!I had goosebumps the whole time watching this!You're truly one of a kind and the world needs you!❤
The modern day Shakespeare !!
Let's hope this masterpiece becomes a basic lesson for humanity in time!
Ren, you are truly a miracle for everyone ❤❤
Wow. This is just... Wow
Jesus christ Ren. Im speechless
This Boy Ren gonna blow up and nobody knows it yet. Keep speakin the truth and reach out to the ones who will listen. I have and, I look forward to your drops. Keep these bangers comin
Honestly wasn't sure what to expect this time,but what a fantastic piece of art from start to finish.congratulations to you and Sam and keep on inspiring is all.
THE VIDEO IS EPIC
THIS SONG IS LEGENDARY.
I FREAKING LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF THE LAST 2 WEEKS.
❤❤ Amazing Ren. I love it!!  Much lovefromEurope-Austria
PART 3 OF LEGENDARY SONG!
"Jimmy followed the code inside the land of the free, Put your hand inside the cookie jar, take more than you need, And his example is exaggerated versions of me, and it's a version of him, and it's a version of she, and it's a version of you, There's no escaping the blame, The way we live is parasitic, Fuck the money and fame"  Chilling...
I dont find words ... ! Wow !!!
Never realised Tommy Shelby was musically talented! Jokes. Can't wait for the album!
This is crazy.  Perhaps the greatest video of the 21st century.  405k in 24 hours.  Way to go Ren
incredible.
This is insanely good! The cinematography, the storytelling, everything is just so damn good
Can we talk about how beautiful the rolling camera shot at the beginning was? Genuinely incredible video that’s not afraid to shy away from such a large topic. Keep it going Ren
15 on trending for music💥
Amazing work of art and truth, thank you for all you do! 🔥
6/10 too theatrical and too many pauses song isnt even that great compared to your other stuff
Ren, amazing work from you and Samuel, Thank you 🙏 🙏🙏
Yes indeed ✨
We made it to trending with this one! 🫡🫡🫡
Keep tellin it my friend, keep tellin it! Love you Ren❣️
Ren, this is phenomenal. You captured me from the first note of the piano. In my opinion, it’s the best thing you’ve ever made. ❤
You never fail to impress me, time and time again.
What a ferocious talent you are Ren. Sam, the filming is sensational. What a team, what a triumph, what a finale ! Just as well I can write this. I'm speechless. And the icing on the cake, I got the album this morning of that angel of a postman. I was like a kid again, with a present, ripping off the packaging. Its a beauty, cheers👍
Ren takes it all to a new place
Like the old carlsburg adverts  if ren made movies thered be the best movies in the world ❤❤
Wow. Amazing performance man. Keep it up!!! You're speaking the truth and raising hell. ❤️‍🔥
It's brilliant on so many levels! Can anyone count how many cuts are in this video? I found one on 0:44 and then on 5:35...
Literally never heard of you before Ren but holy shit I must say I was entranced by this.
This isnt entertainment. Its real life. 🔥
Absolute masterpiece!
Truly legitimate
The best ever preformance ive seen with the most important message to the world i can think of.
I love music that emphasizes it is an art form and a way to express oneself. Excellent work Ren, Sam, and all involved in the creative process.
Joe weller and Cillian Murphy if they had a child
Powerful stuff Ren. Beautifully written, filmed and performed. Yet another masterpiece. ❤️
Masterpiece, love you ren
Respect
wow, amazing guys!
Simply genius.
I must have watched in 10 times on here and watched more than 20 reactions it's funny when people say is that ren playing the piano thought it would be obvious the rings he wears are a dead give away plus you can't mistake rens finger game 😂❤
Just… thank you
Ren could possibly be the greatest artist to come from this shitty little island of ours! Better than Lennon better than McCartney better than them all... Ren is the goat 🐐 ❤
god i love ren!
This brought me back to Jenny and screech. Ren is a lyrical genius Every song and album of Rens is a masterpiece 💜
❤❤❤❤❤
Literally just pure talent ren, the acting skills and graft of story telling too, enjoying this sort of stuff mate ❤ open people's eyes of truth
This was just brilliant a must listen for everyone 👏 ❤
Uncomfortable.  That red tie- dang.
Just mind blowing genius !!..and you look so good wet too 😉..sorry..not sorry 🤣❤
Life = Money game.
Powerful rhymes .. strong message  Thank you
Wow
Exceptional! Wake up call to us all! You are simply one of the greatest artists of our generation (if not the one) and doing all independently! Hats off! You deserve it all! 🙏
❤REN DID IT AGAIN❤
When we as a collective receive such a pure reflection of our shadow in the form of art - it's grace. Thank you Ren.
Ok, a day later I can form a few words. The lyrics. The composition. The cinematography. The choreography. The performance. There are just no words.... this was a complete masterpiece. Thank you, Ren.
💰💸💵💶💷💴🎮🎯🎰
Alright alright, I see you tickling them ivories..
Wooop wooop another one ❤
Great
Magnificent
Amazing work!
Still awesomeness 🙏🦉❤️🐊👍
Bloody brilliant. Brilliant!
I absolutely LOVE you Ren...you are a Bard, period! Samuel, you are a genius. When the two of you collaborate on a project, it is nothing short of mind blowing. Thank you.
❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥 Love you sick boi
Jeez!  That was intense!  OMAGAWD!
Well worth the wait. Man, I love this. I have become a fan of yours. I could ramble about many reasons why, but I'll just say, Respect.
impressive
Hi Ren
Smash
I just don't know what to say except, when you think REN can't go higher he produces something out of this world. This is unbelievably good. 🤯🤯
"For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows."  Undeniably one of the best creations I’ve experienced. I say creations because I don’t know whether to call it music, theater, poetry? I would say all and then some. Ren is a Genius!
супер, собрал фишки и зарядил)))
Ren you are amazing. I've been sharing your content with everyone I know. I hope you get everything you want.
I love rens music my words can't express how grateful iam for your music 🙌 keep the masterpieces coming ❤
Funking awesome worth the wait we'll done to you and your team ren...what's next...can't imagine I'm sure it'll be off flow
Love the masterpiece Ren
Pure gold. Pun not intended XD
Bring the change ✊🏻
Ren, Ren, Ren! You are a genius and i wish i could pick your brain. LOL, not in a weird way. This mastery clip gives me some 'reservoir dogs' vibes, don't ask me why. Maybe because it's all so original and 'rich' that i need something to anker it in my brain, to grasp it? Because i'm a human being and right now i'm asking myself: what are you? You change lives! That's for sure! So much love from Belgium! ❤❤❤❤
Amazing,and the many little details mind blowing
Artistically very well done. Music was exquisite and the bars were top notch.  HOWEVER the content of those lyrics are a tired and unrealistic trope of socialist/communist idealism. It completely misunderstands/misrepresents what money is. It isn’t an invention of the greedy men. Money is a valuation of a resource. It is represented or backed by property, capacity of production, innovation or military force.  Greed is the manifestation of a culture morally devoid. Money is a resource that the greedy exploit like people. Saying money is an invented evil is like saying people are an invented evil.  Evil men don’t stop being evil when they collectivize. They take on new roles in the upper echelons of a high party collective. China USSR North Korea are all examples of this.
Yo ren did you still sell seashells? I need for stock
Brilliant Ren
Simply stunning. No, check that - very meticulously stunning.
Algo
Ren you are already a national treasure,  just a musical genius, take care REN.
Absolute genius!!A true masterpiece!!
"We must be better simply because the option exists." - Ren
Daaaaaaaamn!
Music like this makes me want to learn piano. Its such a beautiful instrument. Ren is such a unique artist as well which is what i love about him. Every song is more then just something to listen to, its an experience, and thats incredible. So talented.
Love it. All of this is driven by the fear of ostracisation. That's why solitary is the ultimate punishment in prison. As you call out, Men are taught from birth that you absolutely must not be vulnerable in public, as you will be ostracised for not being a manly, dependable protector.  So instead we slowly go insane over years of isolation and feeling like there is no one to talk too. Because it is weak to burden others with your problems.
After watching it for 10+ times i'm still speechless but want to leave a comment for the algorithm ❤
He is a genius
😮❤
As always smashed it and so did Sam!
.HIU.
Fuck this is the real gold
First time listening to ren . Definitely deep and well put together. Great stuff
Such a rare, raw, honest talent. Videos like this and Hi Ren, are what MTV tried to be, but never achieved.
Greatest music video I've ever seen!!
Most excellent
Ren you must be 100 then
🔥❤️
Now that's talent!!! Ty ren❤❤❤
Another artistic and lyrical masterpiece Ren. Don't know how you do it but damn man. You create music that hits so hard. It's bleak but beautiful in how you do it. I love the freedom you have with your music
Ren, please keep doing what you do. Watching your courageous exploration of art in a commercial world is nothing short of awe-inspiring. Congrats on yet another impressive chapter of growth, grit, and talent. Well done.
Second time watching now. Loving it even more!
What a time to be alive.  To experience the journey with Ren.  It's always a blast and learning process of a unique kind.  Thanks for everything!
Omg I just finished a long shift today and I'm so tired. But I just saw this song is out, and had to listen! Thank you! The whole money game series has been so thought provoking.
Mate I love your music but damn that trigger finger……always treat as if it’s loaded and keep it off the trigger. We get Crow and Alec Baldwin issues cause of that.
The Epitome of SUPER TALENT 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
also wanted to say thankyou to Samuel and Ren ur vision is out of this world and yes Ren kINDNESS is the future xxxxx
Who stands behind all those ideas… I mean the music videos are also genious….
Beautifully done! Ive got chills. Always such powerful words! ❤
Another masterpiece 🙏🏾🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇬🇧
Was it worth the wait, the hype, and the anticipation, worth the days I sat and contemplated Ren's new creation,  wond'ring 'bout the music style: would it make radio stations?  All the hours that I whiled away in pure speculation, all the guessing games, the seven sins, unfettered elation watching people work together through their screens across nations-- total strangers helping strangers when they sensed a frustration-- to unlock the codes. Whole days they spent in full concentration,  and when one succeeded, all found cause for great celebration. Finally, it's here; we're witnesses to this culmination  of it all, so to the question: was it worth all our patience?  YES. The answer is yes. Another 9 minutes and nineteen seconds of my life just flew by in breathless seconds as I watched the product of this massive and ambitious undertaking, and all I can say is: wow.   Ren didn't live up to the hype; he far surpassed expectations.   Congratulations, Ren. As a fan of yours for what seems like ages, but really is less than a year, I'm so proud that I found your music (or it found me) in time to witness what I think has the potential to not only upend the music industry and the way we consume art, but also to change the way we see ourselves, others, and the rest of the world and the "system" in which we function. You're a true Renaissance Man, and I firmly believe that this is history in the making. And, as Knox said: Masterpiece. Totally worth my impatiently patient wait.
good
money game 3 what a joy never been so excited this was so sick xxx thanku and now i hav got sick boi album best Crimbo🎅🏻 pressie ever it’s been on none stop in my car and on you tube constantly even my son who is a massiveeeee eminem fan is turning cote !!! thanku Ren ur understanding of life is so interesting and make you evaluate everything so thanks for that too xxxxx stay well Ren xxxx

Ren the one
Amazing work
❤️
Not sure how many times I have watched this masterpiece now…. In between listening to Sick Boi album which is a full 18 track album of genuine wonderment… don’t even know what I want to say …. Just thank you!!! 🥰
Love this so much ren i been waiting for this so long
Wow... Oh Ren, you lovely soul..   so much intensity and pain. Painted so beautifully and masterfully. so much to say, said with strength that shook my husband and i, gave me goosebumps. it was a journey i was not expecting to take this morning, but the tears and joy it brought were worth the ride. Thank you for this. have an amazing present!
let's gooooo 💪
oh, wow!   i didn't expect that one.
Sick. Boi on my phone …plan listen to it like a concept album. This song is ohhh so sweet
This is amazing! Eminem vibes
Absolutely brilliant 💜 As a pianist, it always fills me with joy to hear piano. Especially such skilled playing.  #frisson
From what I can tell it is a single take. If so this is extremely impressive. Not just for that but for being as poetic, insightful, subversive and shocking as we have come to expect from Ren.
Proudly spinning your art on my turntable this afternoon Ren 🙌🏼🪄🎵💣❤️🫡 sounds epic coming through my Wharfdale Diamond 9s 😎
❤❤❤
Beautiful!
no pressure @RenMakesMusic @SamuelPerryFalvey  CANNOT wait to see the live acoustic version
Dude! Mind blown! 🤯
Honestly, werk
inside his palace with a mountain of gold But the riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves Weighing heavy on his conscience is the value of gold A Lamborghini for a life, trading money for souls
I'm following you since a long time and everytime i get goosebumps. You are an inspiration!
You never disappoint
Love love love this 🎉🎉
Not even know what to say
MASTERPIECE, Ren ur a one off  an artistic  genius ❤❤❤
Woah
45 - Donald Trump
Modern “The Wall”… Can’t wait to see you open for Floyd at their reunion tour. this is a Masterpiece
wow, this is incredibly fucking good. excellent filmmaking and songwriting, when it ended i was surprised it lasts nine minutes, i was so engaged it felt like 4 or 5 hahahahhah
Absolute fan of your musicianship, your storytelling, and the pure genius of your videos, especially when you're working with Sam. I normally don't interact on videos but I'll be damned if this song and message gets buried in the algorithm for.... reasons...
I are the best mate!
........
... nice intro - borrowed by Grieg ;) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZijt_bIh5o
This was probably the best video I've seen in really long time. Ren is a lyrical genius and the messages he sends are the truth. Never stop making music.
Wonderful Work <3
Jimmy’s intro vocals sure does sound similar to Violet’s vocals… wonder if that moment of passion is going to pop up somewhere later?
Speechless. Thank you.
This is unbelievably good! Ren, you are a genius, one of the best artists around right now!
19 hours since the premiere and already sitting at 333k views. Lets go!!! ❤
Really enjoyed the video. Awesome work 🩷
I'm 52 years old, and I've never played "air piano" before..... until just now.
Legendary 👏
This song is a masterpiece, a modern moonlight sonata you could even say. I love how fast and agressive it is while still being slow and beautiful in parts. 10/10 Ren, keep up the wonderful creations and thank you for them.
Masterpiece!
I love what you did with money game 1-3... it points  at so many problems our society has... In a way that is somehow dead- serious, yet entertaining...  I hope many people start thinking about their ideologies and lives because of this...  and hopefully some will even be able to make a change...  Thank you Ren!
This is absolute Brilliance
Yay
Yep.
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I missed this Ren 💗
Insane how good this is
Ren for James Bond theme track
“For what good is it for a man to gain the whole world, but lose his soul.”   “For the love of money, is the root of all evil.”
It fucking hurts my head how someone can continue to raise the bar! Where the fuck does Ren's talent end? I appreciate the team Ren has but he is directing his vision. Where the fuck you at Netflix! Give Sam & Ren a proper budget & they will change pop culture forever. #NEWGENRE
Amazing!!! Truly a masterpiece!
This is art
This is truly a masterpiece on every level
What an absolute masterpiece!! It’s a true art form, how you do it, how you bring up social economics and it’s downfalls! All of it! Ren, you’re a genius
lol i looked for part 2 and realised there is a part 3 already
This hits differently first thing in the morning! So beautiful!!!
Another great piece of artistry from Ren and Sam ❤
only 41k? deserves more.
Can’t say anything but amazing.  A full circle and everything you have done in the run up to this…My mind is blown! Ren you are the fuckin man!!! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿👍👍🤟🤟🤟🤟
Awsomme!!
goosebumps abound!  in many songs, at different  times, all the time!  I love being along in your journey!  no other has done that to me! none!  crazy! goosebumps all through this!
Oh wow. This music video is AMAZING. Genuinely one of the best I’ve ever seen.
Fuck you. Legend. Thank you. Stay strong. So much love.
Art.
👁️‍🗨️Truth💯.
Amazing story telling and visually stunning as always!
Difficult to watch as it rings true to society. Beautiful concept magnificently executed.
✨👌🏼✨
🎈🎈🎈
OK crazy idea, socialism XD
Una obra de arte la ptm
Holy fuck.  You've outdone yourself once again sir.
Incredible storytelling.
Damn.  Speechless 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Beautiful.
This i just such a strong piece of art. I’m shocked
What a movie 💯🎬🎵
Давно тебя смотрю, растешь на глазах!
Absolute legend.
Just have to say you’re new album Sick Boi is awesome brother just got my download this morning at 7am
Love your ability to tell stories through song and theatrics. My wife and I always watch these with one another and have bonded through your music. I know you are struggling with health issues and hope that can make it through to a place of pure enjoyment. At the very least the amount of enjoyment you bring to myself, my wife and anybody else that listens to or relates to any musical masterpiece that you seem to release in a consistant manner.
Crazy
The best track Ren has pulled out yet. The wait was indescribably worth it. It isn’t just music, it is life. Ren, if you’re reading this, you’re a massive inspiration to me. You are an artistic genius, and I only wish I were half as good as you and your tracks. ✌️
THE CAMERAWORK IS FIRE COMPARED TO THE OTHER MONEY GAMES AND THE INTRO MAKES ME WANNA AIFJOAIFHOIEAHF, this is by far the best money game
My heart dropped every second he sang, his storytelling is beyond explained! So proud of you man what an insane production. Your team deserves a lot of love ❤
My heart dropped every second he sang, his storytelling is beyond explained! So proud of you man what an insane production. Your team deserves a lot of love ❤
Come to Sweden ❤
had the new album on all morning and my vinyls and tops just arrived!!! Happy Mf'ing Friday 13th! <3
👏🏻
my… god… That is fantastic… Like rly - he is right! This is how we live now, and that is depressing…
This is incredible
I know where the money is, but think I will leave it there, 😂
So envious of people who are so good at telling stories through music.  Sometimes I try and it ends up the corniest cheesiest crap. What a gift this guy is to all our ears and minds.  👍👍👏👏
my little girl just turned 2 and she is already reading. We didn't teach her this, we didn't even teach her the alphabet. She figured it out on her own. I wonder how "6 years old and already reading and writing" gets the message of gifted across. I think that's below average isn't it?
That was a long-ass intro to Money Game Part IV (please).
Oh WoW! Ren I love the music, love your amazing singing voice, the words, the story, all that and your acting has all totally created a new level and  for me your presence landed and shook the ground! ❤ ✌️ 🙏
King 🎉❤ Masterpiece!!!!
I don’t mean this vindictively, but I sincerely hope the commercial music stars and the industry that turns the mediocre into polished product sit up, take note, and feel suitably humbled by Ren and the people working with him. True talent, and “a breath of fresh air” hardly scratches the surface.
Amazing work
Sick Boy Album and all it's related video production set the claim for Ren as one of the most relevant artist of this decade.
Thank you for sharing this with the world Sam and Ren!!! Brought back a memory of a moving art piece I experienced at the Guggenheim. Just have to sit for 10 min to let it soak into the soul, so impactful. That I will never be able to experience again :( , this I can experience over and over :) Love your art.
Absolutely brutal! The best work by far, both poetically and film wise. Well done team. Well done!
Simply genius. Took me many years of life to figure out the system we're enslaved to from the moment we can talk, the first day at school, the onslaught of constant advertising, war that kill the poor to profit the rich.... people need to listen deeply to lyrics like these, wisdom that can sometimes never be learned in a lifetime, and just maybe if enough can realise young enough, with messages like this, we can change our life's and world into a far far better place. Amazing song and performance Ren, stunning video Sam, incredible talent.
Wow!
i listen to every money game song since the release i love the series   keep going Ren love your music   Greetings from germany
I’ve been following you since 16, now 24. You have a gift with the work ethic to suit, how you can keep evolving your productions from amazing music to thought provoking masterpieces is flabbergasting man. Having people like you online is so important. Can’t wait for what comes next, huge respect from Ireland!
absolute masterpiece
Thank you, Ren!
You are wise beyond your years. You & your crew are masters in your art❤❤ Only good can come from this 🙏🙏
Ridiculously talented. Such a surreal portrait you paint sir.
Masterpiece of creativity by 2 artists, Sam and Ren. Ren, i feel so god damn lucky to be a live during this time to witness your art. You are inspirational in so many ways. thanks for the journey man. much love from a 48 year old 90's kid x
amazing!
This is art. Impressive!
My few last days were amazing but this is far better than all these days combined into one. I felt so much emotions inside of me listening and watching. It left me with tears running down my cheeks. I love you man i hope you will continue this form of art
Can't relate 😂
Man, I've watched this many times now and... still have no words. Just here to say: Ren, do exactly what you are doing to this day, because it's absolutely amazing. And hold on to your team, cause they are wonderful.
thank you for another masterpiece ren. you never fail to amaze me with each and every one of your works. you're the first artist to make me wait all excited every time there's a new release.
Fire right here great work
I have no adequate words.  Just... stunning!  You (and your talented team!) are a gift to the world.  ❤
Fucking hell Ren! I can’t compute how insanely powerful this is.  Breathtaking x
Ren's greatest work to date 👏
From the first image, to the last click.... Even the globe stops on Cuba and the effing bottle clinks to the beat. What a perfect shit. REN's crew is incredible.
Renegade movement! Boarders are created for future wars to Make money , the world is a show a play and we all participate. Born, consume , work , repeat .. Ren is a movement for true earthly freedom and the ability to create a fair a just society.  Netflix , broadway coming ..
A masterpiece, Im following you now since more then a year and I have to say that its beautifull to see the developing of you art.  PS: the start of the live stream yesterday sounded great (I mean the threee minutes with the guitar player)
Beautiful ❤
this song gives me deja vu
deep
Thank you Ren and Youtube Algorithm (for bringing me back here)
Another masterpiece
Still so glad to have witnessed this in my lifetime
Fuck yeah
I never thought you, or anyone, could top Hi Ren in any capacity what so ever. Boy, am I pleased that I was so wrong. Now everyday moving forward will be filled with anticipation for what ever you and your partners do next. Incredibly incredible.
Ren! Ty chuju! To jest absolutnie wspaniałe!
damn bro, did you straight up just threaten global civil war and point the gun at the rich politicians through the screen you refer to as "parasytes"? You spin the globe at the same time as the word "war", I think that was an intentional message but I could be wrong.
Dude you never cease to amaze ❤ 💯
Well, that’s an experience for the ages.
WOW. Ren does not miss. A great song/video/lesson.
Brother wow just wow... wow
Genius level shit!
This is absolutely magnificant!
Art as Service
Up there with his best work. Flawless. That musical composition when he sits in the wheelchair tbe first time and the flow of words is just simply stunning! Genius work yet again. Raising the bar everytime. Everythjng about this is so good!
Ren, you nailed it again. I think it's time for some kind of full lenght movie/theatrical piece/musical...
Amazing story telling,
6:41 He did it again: Breaking the 4th wall, talking direktly to the Audience.  "The way we live is parasitic, fuck the money and fame This ain’t entertainment, this is real life The way we live is lunacy, community, it declines Hyperpolerised, always fighting, then we divide Truth is less important than the money that we designed? Money's an invention, politics from our invention They all come from peoples ideas, did I mention? Borders? Our invention, law and order, fuel the tension That leads to people killing each other. My solution? Everything is subject to change We can build utopias if individuals are taught to use their brains"  Let's use our brains to build an utopia, for all of us, not just to maximize our own profit!!
❤
Seeing Ren's musical genius somehow reminds me of Stromae.
Very rare that a music video leaves me lost for words staring at the screen with my mouth hanging open. This is one of those rare moments. Absolute masterpiece, Ren never misses
Just a Masterpiece.
I wish there was a way to like this video to match the way I feel about it. A little thumbs up just doesn't seem quite equivalent. Outstanding work, your voice is essential.
I love your work.Genius..🙏🏻❤️‍🔥👍🏻🫶🏻
Strewth
Damn mindblowing video!! ...Pure brilliance yet again! Lovin it 💕
a return to the roots of storytelling and theatre! Ren is a major force, those who come across him are the fortunate ones that try to open their eyes from modern society. Big props to Samuel on this one, impeccable job, even tho Ren's acting is greatly underrated!
What a great story teller you are, Ren!
Came to rewatch a video and I did not know this came out. I hate YouTube
Wow everyone involved in this should be very proud its an amazing piece of art. this must of been an amazing year for you Ren.  hard work and hustle has really paid off pleased to be part of this journey.  looking forward to listening to  the album.  First record I brought for about 20 years 😂
This is brilliant! The music video and the lyrics feel like a collection of Hi, Ren, Jenny & Screech's Tale, Animal Flow, Illest of our Time and Sick Boi! I'm so here for this, this is a masterpiece!!
Holy shit the goosebumps my guy. Always gold with you sir. Well done!
a minute in and I love so much about this! Great cinematography!
Watched it about ten times already - another masterpiece. So thought provoking, definitely worth the wait x
Ren, I love all your music. What you have done here is beyond impressive! This kind of "not background music" is extremely refreshing!
Masterpiece
Actual amazing work of art. I am left speechless- Congratulations.
wow what a great piece of art. Money can't buy happiness! Great job as always Ren and Samuel
Rens ability to story tell is unmatched❤❤❤
Kinda speechlessly struck . I have no idea what more you can create but I know it will deliver. Don't do hero worship, but right now my appreciation is beyond sky high. So diverse , so talented, and once again so unable to be pigeonholed as I said years ago . WOW. Thank you ✌️
Beautiful, my brother! Phenomenal work of art. Can't wait for my CD.
amazing
This is what we need
It feels like your songs are getting better an better
Fucking hell Ren.  Just... wow.  You truly are a talent.
Genius
your songs and clips are gripping me each time. its a very good and special song, thank you :)
Fuck that was intense.   You are brilliant and we need more humans like you. Please keep speaking.
🔥
Amazing stuff Ren. Video is so beautifully shot.
Yes Ren 🎉
very nice piece, love the work you and your team produce.  great video.
Bloody brilliant every single song.on the album amazing
Words cannot express how exceptional this is. I’m simply in awe of the talent that is on display. Never in a million years did I think I could uncover something so meaningful, poignant and visually captivating. You my friend, will make every inch of humankind stand up and listen. This is a gift that only few possess.
Aw very funeral of a friend not musical visually
breathless
Brilliant, the 6min mark shot is especially beautiful. ❤
Is it just me that wants to crawl inside RENs mind and stay for awhile in amazement?😳🫣❤️‍🔥 masterpiece ❤️❤️❤️
Man, thats sure ia something
Ren is one of those artists who absolutely transcends their genre. I don't like rap, but I like this.
Ren, I need a rock concept album next, please and thanks..😉😁
Ren slapped us in the face with this one!  Oh rain, rain, rain. A storm it comes out way!  Take heed. Wake up. Open your eyes. We are ALL a part of this money game. The true indoctrination happens to us all in this culture. Thank you Ren! Thank you.
F'ckin' ell Ren - just when I think I've seen it all. Consistently the most unique and challenging artist I've seen for a  long time.  Itching for the album to arrive.
Just incredible. No more words are needed to describe your work.
WOW! This is composed exceptionally well!
Another Masterpiece ;) Love and Peace to One and All
Ren is on top of his game! 🤑
This is absolutely beautiful! The lies we are told about this place we call earth are staggering. Seek within and find the real truth of who you really are.
Next James Bond ?
Like Meditation - suddenly 9 minutes has passed and you feel drained 😊 In a good way.
Did it again, Ren 😢
As always.... you're a musician, a storyteller, an artist. This is an astounding song!  "And his is example is exaggerated versions of me And its a version of him and its a version of she And its a version you there’s no escaping the blame... "
f'ing great as always
Wow Ren this was really good 👍 😊
My whole life I've felt guilty to be alive in this society where we are force fed the bullshit that we must take and take. We have to give back as much as we take or Ren is right we are all going to die horrible deaths. 💔  but If we can learn to work together like he says....guys....nothing is more powerful.  ❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉 wish I could send you flowers Ren.
WOW....that´s Art, man!
😳
Money game 1 "While my fingers on the trigger of a money game"  Money game 2 "While my fingers on the trigger of a money game"  Money Game 3 "Then he presses the trigger of a money game"   I waited a long time for that correlation
Holy shit... 👏 👏
Amazing. Simply amazing.
Ren, I was speechless and in awe of your performance, lyrics, production, everything. You are a true artist and genius. You deserve all the accolades you are receiving. Keep up the excellent work and be true to yourself and artistry.❤
არაჩვეულებრივი ნამუშევარია,როგორც ყოველთვის...ბრავო!
Once again your giving my brain goosebumps    Your making it impossible to have a favorite
Wow. This is more than what the music landscape needed. On top of that incredible achievement you also embedded the Truth within the composition. Refreshing isn’t the word. Nor merely creative. This is something else on its own entirely. This is on a whole other level that the “industry” is incapable of not just understanding, but seeing.  Genius REN!  Bravo!
Ren, you keep getting better and better, thank you for taking us on your ride.
tnx ren
Sick camera work
Truth😢
Oops! Hi Ren's bad Ren was quite correct. You are so fookin pretentious. Also, the gun to head stressed-out imagery -- Stephan Knight did it before in Peaky Blinders. You've got a lot of potential. Step back and be real. Stop trying to be important.
I am blown away by this incredible masterpiece!  Ren, you've outdone yourself!  Kudos to you and everyone involved with this video!  The message is clear and needs to be spread.
YESSSSS!!!🙏✌️🤲So cool. Love it brother!!! You are a wonderful performer my man. I hope for better for us all as well!!!
Damn always seem to come harder and harder everytime. No pressure tho lol. Keep up the Good Shit! Ren!
Maybe the fact that you're so underrated is the reason you're such treasure for a lot of your listeners. You never fail to dissapoint Ren. God bless!
If they don't pick Ren to make the theme for the next Bond theme then I may boycott it! Who's with me?   At the end of this all I could do was laugh. It's utterly ridonkulous how good this is!
Truly amazing as always. I liked your video on the hillside in Calgary too.
you sick son a mother❤‍🔥!
bfff que puta locura.....
I’ve watched this about 30 times now and it just keeps getting better. I’m so blown away. I hope more and more hear Ren.  I want change. Many want change. The people who benefit want things to stay the same. How do we change when they hold the keys. Money is power. Let’s destroy it all
More ppl need listen this 😮
interaction
Live In Power King
woah
I love it ❤
PHENOMENAL!🔥🔥🔥 Huge congratulations to you Ren, Sam and everyone involved in making this absolute Masterpiece ❤
I liked someone else's comment.
the broken structure of our systems is pretty apperent but people are to easily conned into "white vs black" "muslim vs christian" "my country against yours", etc.  the only fight of note our species has fought since quite a while is capital vs the rest of us and sadly capital always wins; it still is and it probably always will. it's only getting stronger and seemingly harder for people to see.  the same thing which granted us the most incredible achievments called ambition, is also the same thing that makes kids in many countries crawl through mines, dig in toxic waste or hunger, cause it's other name is creed. it's like an inherent flaw in our DNA. this need to always want more comes at a cost when you don't activly combat it, and most (if not the vast majority) just don't even realize it.
Powerful. Shareworthy

Awesome mate!! Love from Sweden
Phenomenal Story Telling.
Absolutely incredible! You are a living legend already.
Incredible art.❤
Holy fuck !! This is a masterpiece ! How you keep doing it
Epic!
Absolutely stunning Ren!!!  I think this, Hi Ren and Jenny/Screetch/Violet are your best works. No1 is still Hi Ren because it affects me personally but directly followed by MG3. Its incredible that this isn't produced by a huge studio/team. You and Sam are meant to work together.
Now that's a nice pianist.... 😂
Such a incredible video your best work yet!
Ren The Great 👍
Ur talent is unbelievable! Everything u put out becomes my new favorite.
Brilliant Song
SAM, you're a Master in your own right! Coupled together, you might just turn humanity towards more unconditional Love and Unity. Thank You for this masterpiece!😍❤❤❤❤
Excellent, more than a singer, he's an all round performing artist.
Wow. Incredible. Lyrics, music, imagery, storytelling, cinematography… just all incredibly done. Thanks again for sharing your talents and wisdom. ❤
Like the most talented artist on thr whole world rn. No kidding
congratulations ren having number 1 on the uk itune album charts totally deserved and money game part 3 is the best song ive ever heard.the video is incredible and you my friend deserve all the flowers and more so.
True
Absolutely brilliant
Wow, just wow
sickkkk
Taking your words, this is not entertainment. No. This is pure art. Poem coated into modern day's genre.  History gotta accept the fact, Ren is here to stay!
Oh, oh man this is amazing
REN, you're a brilliant, brilliant artist with a knife-sharp mind. You are OUR gift: to see, hear & behold!❣️🙏❤
played out.
What a amazing sponge and video!!!
Ren, Sam, and everyone who contributed to this, thank you, for your dedication to the art, thank you for the critically important messaging your art conveys so eloquently.  I've never been more transfixed by a musician and storyteller, and by the visual accompaniment.  Truly, this is a masterpiece, which doesn't quite do it justice, especially with the game and its final story leading up to this release.  I was already all in on EVERYTHING y'all do, but I'm so excited to see where you take us next.  You've set a very high bar for music and art in my opinion, but I'm so so thankful I stumbled down this magical rabbit hole a few months ago! 🤌👏👏👏🫶
My flow of thoughts: - oh look a new Ren video, a wheelchair again? Should I watch it? But it's 9 minutes long... - okay, let me play it for a minute and see if it's any good, I can always turn it off  *after 9 minutes* - oh wow, okay... just.. wow... a masterpiece again, it was worth spending those 9 minutes for such a powerful video
Wow. No other words. Just Wow.
Damnnnnn
Masterpiece.
This is Ridiculously Good, it is a work of Art and anyone Judging it just as a song is missing the point
My guy. You. Are the most captivating artist I have come across.
Congrats to all involved to that masterpiece!
The universe: so Ren do you want to be a talented poet, a philosopher, a musician or an actor?  Ren: yes.
This is stunning! I've watched this so many times! Many lessons to be learned here ❤
this song gives me goosebumps . fantastic job !
Sick Boi T-shirt dropped through my door just as I was putting this on again. Thank you Ren and team. Love this, love the t-shirt
My God what an epic call conclusion to the Money Game.  I’m watching this over and over.  I’m downloading my digital today as soon as I can. Congratulations Ren 🎉🎉🎉. Number 1 on iTunes.
Freaking masterpiece! My Life purpose is to make sure that everyone I know, hears your music. Its an art, id be selfish of me not to spread it around
ren i love you iv been listing for 3 years now
WOW, just WOW  im more then speechless
🔥🔥🔥
Probably your best so far
So to stop the greed, lies etc etc, we need to raise our conscious and raise our youth better?? Is that the money game trilogy?
I have no words. There are none written yet to describe this beautiful piece of art. ❤
You are so talented Ren , thank you for sharing your gift.
Another absolute masterpiece!! Well done Ren and the team! :)
An extraordinary piece of Art, I can't praise this highly enough. You, Sam and your team knocked it out of the park with this one. I even got Heath Ledger Joker vibes when you sidled from piano to mirror. Crazy performance, just incredible.🐐
As usual absolute masterpiece, gave me goosebumps ❤
Honestly a masterpiece
wow
A lesson teaching what is important, and what is not. Disturbingly real. Thank you, for yet another masterpiece.
This is an absolute work of art!!!!💖💖💖
The 9-minute format suits you so well! A short story in video ❤
Masterpiece as always ren ❤
Playing my VINYL copy of Sick Boi. The absolute best album in a decade. Cheers dude.
He's done it again
This song and video gave me literal physical and emotional reactions. This is an absolute masterpiece. Much love, brother keep up the amazing work my man.
God damn this was another masterpiece.
👍🏻
Damn, the video quality is good
What an absolute genius
there's a third one now?!? that's amazing! i love this trilogy!
you are a work of art
Fuck me that hit hard and left a void I don't know how to fill. A lyrical and  visual masterpiece!
Pure brilliance!
Words cant do this masterpiece justice, Ren & Sam are amazing artists that put out thought provoking stuff in such an eloquent & stylish way, ART at its finest
One the best of our time🎶🎵
One of the most talented artists I've ever seen!
The greatest sequel about luigi talking about sea shells
Just WOW! I can't express myself,this is something else…😳
She sells sea shells by the sea shore.
What a masterpiece!!!!
🫡
No words…
I have tears rolling down my face. Great work everyone. Truly haunting and beautiful but so painfully true.
...And the f&$_k1g Sam...Genius 📽️🎬💡
Very cool, thx ❤
I had goosebumps the whole video, it just hits where it's meant to. Keep it up
Another masterwork! I don't know how to get your attention but I want to offer you my services... I broke my back in a car accident when I was 20. I finished college and tried making a living as a philosophy teacher. But times were wrong. I became an actor (small indy films) and a song writer (nothing close to your level) but I think I could complement you in a number of ways... I'm now almost 60 years old... and I'm dying to do something meaningful with my life still. I think I could contribute to what you're doing... well... let me know if you ever see this and think I can do something for you in some way!
You going to tour dude, Wolverhampton civic ( the halls) or ok steel mills, make it happen please man!!
im so thankful for ur music ren... u give me a little light when its so dark in my life....
Great track
❤
British boy released another song about capitalism
Are you not entertained!!?
Pure genius, love it.
We get nine minutes of money game🤌🤌🤌🤌✨️✨️✨️✨️ i cant- your way of story telling is just amazing and yet the songs just stick in my brain for days on end, i am so happy i discovered you a few years ago, your music just scratches my brain the right way
We need stop butchering each other over wealth and politics and race and religion. We all need to start brewing more social kombucha and growing cultures that thrive. Fucking outstanding as per usual.
Brilliant! Nuf Said I have watched this one 10 times already in addition to three reactions (Knox killed) Love your stuff REN Can't wait to see Part 4 or whatever you have planned next!
One like isn’t enough to do this justice
Linguistic Larceny 🔥🔥🔥 you stimulate me in EVERY way ren😮💧
Stunning
Fuck me, that one cut deep. Ren is a revolution. As many people as possible need to experience this art.
God Damn !!! Blowing my mind too 🤯
This is incredible!
I wonder how the reactors have the ability to stop and comment on things. The first time I watched this video, I was frozen with dropped jaw, opened mouth, dialated pupils and shallow breathing the whole time. I wish all the best and send my gratitude and respect for the masterminds behind this wonderful piece of art!
Wow
WOW!!!
Comrade Ren!!!
I cannot shake my head enough in utter awe at Ren's mastery of each and every thing he does. I am just blown away by all he creates and how I can find a song/vid to fit each and every mood I find myself in. The true definition of an artist! And to cap it all off - I am present at the same time on earth to witness it in real time! Lucky me, Lucky us! Keep 'er lit Ren! 🔥🔥🔥🔥 Go raibh míle maith agat!
Wow
Amazing
wah .. concise .. accurate... more than adequate .. thank you again Ren
I’m never disappointed when the notification pops up about new music from Ren. Absolute master piece! 👏🏻
Awesome
The brilliance of Ren… bringing the reality of life into what I want to see discussed in the art of song writing!
The fact that Ren wrote, perform all of these is just unbeliviable
😮❤ another great song and loved the video too
I literally cannot stop listening to your music. You're an incredible artist. I gave up music almost 10 years ago and you've made me look at it all in a different way. Thank you.
I honor you and I bow to you Ren ❤‍🔥
The Bard of Brighton Amazing
The relationship between the two artists, musician and videographer, is perfect. I was worried about part 3, not sure how the standards set by part 1 and 2 could be met. Well, it’s Ren, so it was pointless to worry. Another masterclass and another masterpiece
This is simply awesome. I've watched it about 100 times already, probably be 10,000 by the end of the year 😂
help
Dealing shells. Nice throwback 😂
Pure genius
Realm of Ren
your screenwriter and videographer also deserves an award!
Well shit... this is amazing!! Like.. shit! 😱❤️
Yet another masterpiece!!
Great song ren keep it up
Came straight here from listening to it for the first time on the vinyl sick boi I got this morning. Brilliant track, genius film. Now back to the rest of the album…
BRAVO!!!
There is so much to love about this piece of work but I love the mix of vocal, accompanying piano, then strings...which switch the mood brilliantly.  It's the little touches that are just so interesting - the 'Beano' on the desk as the kid generates £millions from a software program...he is still a child at that stage.  Real pathos...brilliant, Ren (and Sam!)
Ren you are just amazing, keep it up and thank you!
Wow again
Absolutely amazing in every way! Beyond comprehension. Yet so easy to understand your views. Masterpiece.
Ren always leaves me speechless . . . such an incredible artist depicting the realities of our time.
I keep rewatching it and it opened my eyes to how destructive I am to my own life. Refusing to be like my parents, but with the greed, I've slowly become them. Not valuing time with my son. I've been chasing money and I couldn't understand why I am so depressed and lost
The camera work and lighting are on a whole another level, well done
Yeah. A masterpiece..  echoing the knowledge of a generation
thankyou  for coming back Ren
Masterful❤
Best, most innovative music video of the year! However I wanted to add that these "overly ambitious winners" of the money game are a rarity, most people dedicate their lives and time to a fight for cheap gucci shirts and bling, rented private jet replicas for instagram and pretending they have money. It's just as toxic.
Led Zeppelin never appeared on TOTP yet Whole Lotta Love was the theme tune. Greatness finds a way to detractors it’s immune.  True talent will prevail if the money men stay away this is what creativity looks like genius will always find a way. Keep going Ren
He did it again. Good job Ren
Bagai diombang-ambingkan ombak. Diempas-empaskan ke karang. Lalu di panggang di gersang padang. Nyelekit. Tajem. Panas. Aduh. Aduh. Aduh. Ren gada tanding emang ❤
Coming from wherever the fk I'm at. Respect from me bruv
Fuck man you absolutely smoked this track
Fucking incredible work from Ren, Sam and team.
Man, I mean, this song has more views than the new Slipknot video, but they came out at the same time  You just became a legend
This is art.
Brilliant! Again.
The names Bond. REN Bond. 1:42
Hello, just leaving a comment.
This is NOT entertainment!! - This is real. Thanks to everyone involved.
Outstanding!!
You Ren are THE artist of our time and that was a beautiful piece of art, truth always speaks volumes and Sam, that was sick camerawork, congratulations to all involved in the production for pulling it off❤
WOW, Netflix this is your wake up call  Give Ren and Sam a big advance to get something on your platform
Wouwsers! Hefty song and heartfelt! Just proves what an amazing artist Ren is! I’m so happy I got to know his music
Holy!! One shot no cut film and beautiful poetry.
It’s true, no one tells it better than Ren. Lives lost its a story on men. I wish I could hear it again. Press play and I play it again x
Amazing the Artist that keeps delivering visually, musically without talking about the absolutely essential message bravo to Samuel and Ren. I hope you're doing well brother . May the All mighty keep you safe , healthy and steadfast on the path of righteousness.
すごいい
8:36
Ren is beautiful
Wow! My son just turned two. So, this hits differently. Thanks Ren! I love your art!
creative genius ~ so deeply disturbing, but so intriguing and honest
That was very cool, indeed.  Nice to put the spotlight on the problems of money, and well orchestrated, delivered.  Y'all should do a collab with Jacob Collier.  I feel he's one of the few on your level.  Get him to put out something darker for once lol.
Congrats
Ren is like a DMT trip just sit back and enjoy it and at the end try to figure out what the hell you just witnessed. 🤘🤘
How can something like this sound like a sad story, yet being exactly what happens in today's world. I love it.
Iv only found ren just over a week ago and  now im absolutely hooked on this genius.
Amazing artistry as alays, gratz Ren and Sam
Woah! Amazing!
Woah I'm speachless. You always manage to suprise me, with the depths of your words and the story you're telling. Thank you for your art from the deepest of my heart
як завжди - це ТОП!!!
Simply Brilliant!!
Incredible. Just absolutely incredible.
Utopia means road to nowhere. It's impossible to reach, because it does not exist. Anyone who's ever tried has become a tyrant and lead a cult. I love the music, but we must be weary of our desire to seize control.
That was 10 minutes????
Wow! What a powerful message, delivered in such a great way. Bravo!
I'm 486 years old and finally found an artist I can connect with
Masterpiece !
Masterpiece!
The storytelling is magical, beautiful, it's captivating and I held my breath a lot of the time. This is a stark reminder of the fact that I am and always will resist(ing) becoming a sheep. That cycle stops with me. Thank you Ren and Sam. It's utterly beautiful.
WHOA! :O I am genuinely mind blown by the message, the lyrics, the product... EVERYTHING! Amazing!
Another fucking masterpiece, Ren!
Man, that really brought me back to the beginning of my Ren journey. There were elements of all your good songs all wrapped into something new and poignant and resonate and relevant. Well done.
❤❤❤❤
This man's a poet
Love the strings and all of the things
He's done it again ❤
I love the way your brain works. What will you do next?
And yet. Still amazed every time.  This man is a true artist.
The True Skills Of A Bard, Master Story Teller.🤯
Wonderful! Amazing! Perfect! Thank you, Ren!
Amazing.
The message, the delivery all Masterclass. I love Ren’s work!
You're just a genius!
Another masterpiece Ren
Leaving a comment for the algorithm
What the fuck did I just see?! This is great. This is a fucking masterpiece! :)))))
Music part sucks
Dam it Ren, every video is a proper piece of art, how the hell do you keep managing to do this!
OMG, watched this several times now and then some of the main reactors KH, BP, Joe E (who looked like he might have a medical episode as the video played out.) Sadly (I hope I'm wrong) rens music could take a back seat for awhile as ren and sam move into cinematography big time. They can rival Lucas, Spielberg and Tarantino 👍
I'm shook
I'm in the thick of depression. Ren, your music is the only thing which keeps me connected to my soul.  Thank you for another incredible masterpiece.  You give me hope, love you man. ❤
I dont even wait for the song to play before adding it to my favorites, anymore. I already know its going in there.
The story of a downward spiral into greed, crime, addiction, and suicide. A bit negative, It doesn't happen to the majority of people, we all live much less colourful/dramatic lives, but it is good fodder for a talented troubador to play to his court. But. Keep guns outta your work. That wasn't cool at all
I've been waiting for days
3:25 Ren delivers yet another masterpiece, whether it is songwriting, screenwriting, singing, performing, or just leaving the world a message, it is so exciting to see him rise to the very pinnacle of success. Go fella ❤
I love everything you do ❤ this songs been in my head since yesterday ...keep being you Ren
Thought I was freezing, here in my heated bus in the Arctic. Turns out its goosebumps from the sheere talent displayed
God damn so beautiful
This is crazy
i'm vegan
WOW another masterclass in writing and performance. Even better sick boi is on the way! Like a kid at Christmas all excited again!
Oh God that was one of the most impressive, powerful video clip I've ever seen, the message is perfectly delivered, everything from the long shots to the scenery is immaculate. Hats off to you, it gave me goosebumps
Wow, thiis is something else
Phenomenal!
Loved it ❤ The story telling is great too ! So much told with so little :)
How the hell did that not even come close to feeling like 9 minutes 🫨🤙🏼💯🔥
.. and Ren's artistic level puts all the others to shame!
This is pretty damn cool.  However, I do hope you don't throw away a good hook / sample or more rhythmic songs for these art pieces. There's a balance between the two, like in the first Money game that'll fit both crowds. I hope you find the balance cause you and the people you are working with like Samuel have the potential to do great things.
Ren for Bond! Part and music. ;-) Love it, cheers once again Ren.
Wow, just wow. Each time you set a bar ridiculously high, so high it seems it cannot be surpassed, first with Money game part 2, then you take it to a whole new level with the tale of Jenny and Screech, then somehow you raise the bar even further with Hi Ren, and now this. Each time it seems you have achieved perfection only to somehow build and improve on it.
Fantastic. Once again.
Simply Blown Away!
Never disappoints
Your music is a true work of art.
Excellent. Shakesperian. Lufit. Keep on rockin Ren !
Rens medium is music but his message the same: “Little Boys and Little Girls are told to not use their brain.”, So we want gain, an we chase fame, Or we campaign, sendin warplanes, til we’re all slain or insane Cause of cash games…  LOADING…
Powerful stuff. Your Utopia where everyone works together for the good of all, is the dream. One day, eh?
The opening vocals (“whoooing”) was haunting, Ren.   This entire production - from lyrics/script to acting to singing to instrumentation to foley sounds to filming - was like nothing I have ever witnessed in my entire life.  Very moving.  Love the message.  Good on you, and everyone involved.  Wow.
Brilliant Ren, just brilliant 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼💐
❤
Wow, Just WOW... Cant wait to get my sick boi CD soon
Ren: putting the art in artist. This is a masterpiece and i got LITERAL goosebumps
I want Tarintino to see this.
Ren...you're the best...a legend to behold👊💯
I don't comment much, but I've gotta; this rocks.
Impressive.
cool
Bravo, bravo, bravo 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 Amazing message, pen, production & sound!
❤
A total brain blast! amazing! The cameraman is a boss, not a single cut, all recorded in one breath
Hey Ren, I think your brain is like a T.A.R.D.I.S. ...it's much much bigger on the INSIDE! 😉
Wow wow wow Ren you absolute legend ❤️‍🔥 this track is not only a work of art, but an absolute masterpiece 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 keep doing what you are doing mate you are an inspiration. Hope you are doing well with your treatment mate all the best.
Ren is the artist that leaves me in tears most regularly in the most abrupt way, when I don't even expect. It was just another normal day for me, took a break from work, decided to see Ren's newest release, and BANG. Crying like a baby now instead of working. There's something unique in Ren that touches me on the deepest levels. Even if rap is not my music of choice. But Ren feels so familiar to my soul. I can't explain that.
Brilliant
Thank you REN.  When we think we've seen everything, you come and show us a new world. Congratulations. Never stop please ❤
My favorite artist in decades. Down loading the album as I write, eagerly waiting for the CD. I haven't bought a CD since the 90s 🤭♥
This is just outstandingly good, everything about it, the composition, Ren’s delivery and presentation. I’m left in awe!
Art
Absolutely brilliant.
Genius
Ren is a music genious of our time but I must also say he is so hot😎
Let's gooo! ❤
Algorithm
Masterclass
Never been so happy to find a new artist! Thanks Ren and Sam for making a thoughtful, virtuoso masterpiece.
Tommy Shelby's Southern reincarnation ;-)
When are we going to have RENFEST where we can see all of the talent that is trapped in the REN vortex on show. Everybody that REN is involved with be it Cinematography, Music, Production, Photography and collaborations. is a master of their art.
I was absolutely sure that Ren was about to drop a masterpiece video soon after he took the animated approach with his last ones. Great video and the lyrics hit the bullseye. Peace
Wow. Next level production.
Special talent 👏
Another masterpiece
Brilliant just brilliant  👏 👌 ❤
Stunningly honest, speechless
I fucking love your music. It's a sword of spiritual truth wielded by a samurai in an ambush to the rear flank of Sodom. They don'y like it up them Mr Mannering! 😂
Masterpiece again Ren 👌
What a crazy good follow up to the already amazing money game part 1 & 2
Unreal 🙌👌
Mate you should go into movies. I see a young Bond. Your music isn't bad either! ;)
true art. everything is so on point. The words, the picture, the music.
Ren's merch team - I have a request/idea. Wearable patches people can sew on their clothes or put velcro on them to stick to backpacks/hats/phone cases/holster etc. Patch idea 1) Ren's sick boi logo 2) A patch with a QR code to Ren's Sick boi site/merch shop. I got the idea from a velcro patch I thought of getting for my cell phone holster on amazon (My holster has velcros for patches). It was a RickRoll QR code . Selfishly going to ask the sizes be around 5.08 (cm) H x 7.62 (cm) L  so I can stick them on my phone holster. 🙂
Amazing video and song, as usual :)
Masterpiece ✨
This has such an incredible message massive props ren 🫡💙
You were so right when you said this one would be special 👏👏👏
Fucking Wow!
Мужик, да ты гений.
It’s majestic, real art. Thank you Ren!
Absolutely genius
Truly masterpiece
Extraordinario!
Wow ren ❤
I just watched a Broadway play, listened to an opera, experienced a masterpiece of art that exquisitely reflects so much of human nature. From bouncing boy to the bye bye bullet... What a magnificent finale to an intricate album with enough nuance that it will still be closely examined and learnt from in a century. All i can say is, thank you, Ren. Thank you so much ❤  🇳🇿
You guys outdid yourselves on this one. Ren, this is sublime work and I can't wait to see your future works on Netflix. Sick Boi is going to be one powerful album! Congrats to all of your well deserved success ! ☺️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💕🎊🎉🎈
You are a f**king genius!!!!
WOW🤯
This transcends music thank you Ren and gang
When he presses up the trigger of a money game - instant goosebumps
Mos def would be proud
let's fucking goooooooo ❤️‍🔥
This song is the perfect progression from the previous Money Games. The lyrics, the music, the video... just brilliant. I am grateful from the bottom of my heart that you exist. ❣
The magician is back at work!!
Как и было сказано - "это жизнь". Спасибо за ваш труд, великолепная работа.
Amazing
Just wow.  So powerful.  Thank you Ren ❤
Sick Boi just arrived in the post - awesome ❤
Every piece is a statement. A statement of musical and political mastery. True life analysis. Battles with mental health, societal and cultural malfunction and corruption.  Absolute genius. Easily. In my opinion, the most talented musical artist I've come across for decades.   I absolutely love your work. Thanks you for using your platform to address the important issues. 🙏
Crazy thing is we all know damocles sword is above the table, but we can't stop ourselves from wanting to sit on it
Masterpiece
NO WORDS incredible wow 🤯
Wow
CAF FRFR

Great song, perfect words! With love from Ukraine
Holy shit. This is real.
Again! Absolutely smashes it! Im so hyped about ren and i hope his album is a massive success(i know it will be). In a league of his own this man is, not 1 person can do what he does. A unique talent! Well done ren and please never stop!
Another thought provoking piece of observational art. Thanks Ren long may your genius continue!
Powerful!!!! Wow , love this ….so extremely well done…. Bravo REN 😍😎
Keep up the good work. May the YouTube algorithm be good for this too. Seem to be trending in music already but I guess one comment and like more will not hurt. Definitely worth of seeing and hearing like all the other ren videos too.
Never knew Thomas Shelby was a lyricist and musician! Well done Ren! Excellent as always!
Dear God, what a journey! Thank you, Ren!
Art. Ren is to contemporary music what Banksy is to visual art. Confronting, beautiful, emoting.
Thanks for your art, Ren. ❤
as someone that's been watching for years now, its amazing to see you go from only getting a few thousand views to being #22 on music trending. you're fkn amazing Ren, keep up the amazing work
You are a channel Ren.  How you have opened up to what is inside you, shedding layers and layers of pain, the truth of what is possible for all of us shines - creativity, energy, clarity, guidance and beauty.  thank you
Hell yea
This song along with Hi Ren are perfection.
bro... you are stunning in the head. thank you
Amazing work! Really really great!
Holy shit Ren!!!  This is truly a work of Art. Thank you 🙏
It's very hard to be original when there's so much you can see on the internet for this man surprises me every time 🙏🏻
Wow this is epic😮
Incredibly well done!
Masterpiece
yeeesss, been waiting for this one!
Awesome, the world needs more of this right now. Keep it up brother we're all proud of you.
Just...keeps...getting... massive!❤
Ren the Bard!  The piano and strings?! *chefs kiss*
Have been waiting all day so I could sit down with a drink and pipe of good tobacco to complement this this of beauty I have dreamed of, I can't wait to hear it, here we go ❤
U wouldn't call this music anymore. This is art at its finest and so much more!
Ren  is a true talent. Great musician, storyteller and this Album of a master piece will still relevant forever.
❤
Absolutely insane. Masterpiece.
Rens creativity is unmatched 😤
"Comfort does not bring Scarcity, being Cool is jus so rare to me. In my skin or in my shirt...I take the pills so I don't hurt. Can't you help me at all? You stole my Air, like "Total Recall!". #Ren I am Breathless...you really are relentless." HUGE Gratitude to you AND your #Ren Team x x x
@RenMakesMusic  You are something else.  I knew that when I first discovered   you . This is some of your best work ever audio wise  and visually  ❤
Oh ren this took my breath away. This is a masterpiece. I could imagine watching this in a theatre.
Algorithm comment
One of the greatest modern artists in my opinion, u deserve something big
Just stop it. Absolute Fire
The camera work is on point.;
I was very busy to be ready for my job interview that happened today and now I'm listening to this master piece of song! Thanks for creating this- it deserves Titanical congratulations from Poland! 😃
This guy is a legend every song means something in life keep it up ren
Holy shit, that was a nice part 3. Keep working man, you're so good  Peace and love from France
Can’t wait for the album 😁😁
There are 171,476 words in current use in the English dictionary. Not ONE can describe how incredible this is
I am 72 and so grateful fort this creative thinker.I've been electrified since I laid eyes on "Hi Ren".
Killin it as always 🤩
What did I just watch? I’m in absolute awe. You are nothing short of a genius Ren. Thank you for sharing your incredible mind with us.
Thank you
The violin playing the melody from part 1 and 2 is such a masterful touch 👌❤️
Fire 🔥
I didn't want it to end , i was transfixed. Thank you for your art and messages ❤
Sam's filming is as masterful & brilliant as your music, Ren. Storytelling, filmmaking, theatre at the level of genius. No record deal could give you this uniqueness. Devoted fan, aged 57.
There is no way this guy is not an alien 👽
You never fail to impress Ren!!! Truly incredible piece of art, beautifully executed (big up Sam and co!!) and that message man. Cudos to you and the team, and thank you for taking us along on the crazy MG3 journey - I will never recover, and I love you all for it😂❤
Unfortunately, the game has been around for a long time... and will last for eons to come.  Fortunately, there are those who put their finger on the wound. It is necessary not to desensitize and not lose the ability to feel the pain that this sh... game causes and, for that, thank you very much Ren.  Good video!  P.S. I'd like to come back here in about 2-3 eons to see if we're still wallowing in this shitty little game!...
This is a creation beyond expression in words.
WOW hes done it again. Absolute mastery of the craft
brilliant! You're a lyrical genius bro. 🔥🔥🔥 And Sam's videography is awesome. Really tells the story well.
Considering how great the story and message are it is a little sad to me, that as a song it has such low replay value. Concept and Video are spot on though!
THIS. this is THE best executed music video ever! and the lyrics are making you feel the art they'e written with❤
The Suit its suits you REN ! u are a class <3
Absolutely brilliant.
PART 4!!!!!
Trending #22 in music! You’ve done so amazingly well, Ren - and all the more impressive given you’re independent and managing your health. Love this, Ren, well done!
Wow
Masterpiece! Lets destroy the money game with Utopia and Love.
Wow🎉🎉
Another masterpiece. They just get better and better. 🙏❤️🤯 Thank you Ren
I'm gobsmacked by every part of this masterpiece!
If you manipulate the truth, the lie will say itself. I felt that line
That was incredible! I can’t wait for the album! ❤
Another classic ❤✌🏻😎✌🏻🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
So worth the wait and hype! This is a work of art! Your a great story teller!
Ren is probably one of most important artists of our generation, keep on creating legend
Awesome as always Ren. Made me think, made me feel, makes me question everything. Most of us want the world to get on and live as one and you embody the way we should all try to think. Not the same, not sheep, all different but all accepting those differences and not putting ourselves over another.
Genius
There was so much hype around that piece that i didnt think it was possible to deliver, yet again Ren proves that he is THE artist. It's just insane at this point that everything this man touches turns to gold.
If you haven’t watched Money Game 1 and 2, I highly recommend it.  Money Game part 2 out of the three is my favorite.❤. You are amazing Ren!
Nuf said (mic drop) 🔥❤🎉
I am a 58 year old house wife, who suffers from auto immune disease and  neurodivergence. I have never enjoyed rap/hip hop but your music is high art and you, a master performer/storyteller. I discovered your music just a few weeks ago whilst I was still recovering from long covid (still am) and my auto immune disease was kicking my ass. Hi Ren was my first introduction to your music. I cried. It lifted me up and gave me hope to continue. I don't know you but I love you. Thank you for sharing yourself with the rest of us. I never purchase music anymore but I am going to own anything you create. Love from the USA
Thank you for existing ren ❤Egypt
Whenever Ren starts a song with “let me tell you a story about about …” you know someone is gonna die. Jokes aside this is incredibly beautiful to watch an listen thanks brother.
Mine mine give me damn all that time time give em
Wow ren  Trained for the game only to find out its rigged  We either  Live together as a growing  community Or wither and die as individuals  I dont know about you but I'm sick of existing in the land of hungry ghosts  Keep shining youre light into the darkness of human nature  Much love to you bro
Masterpiece. The world will recognize Ren
Ren never misses 🔥🔥🔥
HOLYYY SHIIT THIS WAS GOOD, THANKS FOR CREATING SUCH ART FOR ALL OF US TO ENJOY
I'm going through the auto immune jurouney. Recently lost my job and that. I'm using it as a calling to write more music. You are the inspiration. I appreciate that. ❤ ❤
Wow bro done it again man always got like wow lol
Fook
Deep and thoughtful as always! Thank you!
bro your music is such an inspiration to me, wtf it just keeps getting better, love it.
Came here from a 3x4 channel recommendation and, omg, it is amazing 😍
I’m going to need to rewatch this 50 times to completely absorb every piece of detail to appreciate this work of art  And I will ❤
Ren, your insanely talented at music , but I think your real niche is telling a story. I think you could create a musical on the big stages of the world that will be jaw dropping, or dare I say it even a film. Hope some big dogs out there spot you and assist you into making this a reality. Keep going with it all.
Did I spot the Hitchcock technique there? Close-up of the black wheelchair canvas so you can make a unnoticable cut? Great cinematography, guys. Impressively done.
and Rain.. rain... rain.... rain... This storm, this storm is comin' our way
Nah we gotta wake the fuck up
Well Mr Ren you and Sam plus the gang have created something very special. I’m not going to blow smoke up your arse as I know you don’t like it. But big round of applause to you and the team. Also love the album and I have everything crossed for the top spot.
Incredible video and insightful lyrics, Ren.   Thoroughly enjoy your journey. 💙
F*ck! Without fail you shine Ren. And without fail I’m almost in tears…thank you.
Sweet! It's finally out. I haven't listened to the whole thing yet--meaning with headphones while watching intently. However, I still want to say that Money Game 2 is such a classic banger that this one has an inadvertently high bar. I'm excited for this album though, bruh. SO ILL!
When I watched the live premiere,  I was thrown because my beloved guitar riff and the spine-tinglingly beautiful "rain rain rain rain" weren't there. Then I watched it a second time....and ffs Ren, this is f'ing magnificent. I don't know how you keep doing it but please keep doing it ✌
We had so much expectations, we were so hyped by this one and ONCE AGAIN, we are so so far from the reality, so far from the genius of this man. A legend is building his story just in front of us. What a luck for all of us.
Absolyte amazing🖤
That is the most incredible piece of art I have ever had the pleasure to witness with my own eyes. Ground breaking, masterpiece, I could not take my eyes off it. Thank you Ren for entering into my life. I cannot wait to follow the next path of your journey.  Today is Sick Boi day. Enjoy the music Renegades <3
I pray I never grow out of finding this poetry so beautiful
Ren, thank you for your creativity that heals souls, you save me in this difficult time, thank you boy, you are the voice, you are the genius of the modern world.
Just wow wow wow Sir. You touch hearts, make cry, lift spirit. We be inside and outside at the same time. This is poetic, audio-visual Masterpiece
Tu est un génie bouleversant! Ce texte est fou est vraix ,ma ému au plus profond .❤
It's amazing! Truly a cinematic masterpiece
Unbelievable
Real
Play it again, Sam
Masterpiece 👏
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I watched it in order money game 1,2 and now 3. Brilliant. You can see how it got better. I like the reference to hi Ren 👌 and generally to his music there’s a references to his songs in his songs and that’s tough to achieve. I am awaiting for money game 4 and dead serious about it as every song got different side of the money game. Wonder what would be if next one is about a poor construction worker for example, who got no money but have to do what he got to do to support his family. Someone like, a victim of the money game 2 and 3 but doing the same think as there’s no other options
I have a theory on Ren. Bear with me here. I believe in the Talent Fairy. She comes shortly after birth of some artists, pinches some Talent Dust out of her Talent Bucket, and sprinkles talent over the baby. Mozart, Van Gogh, Hendrix, you name it, they all were sprinkled over by the Talent Fairy. But on that fateful day of March 1990, the Talent Fairy had enough. It's a tough and lonely job, you know, nobody ever thanking her... So she hovered over Ren's crib flapping her little wings, said "F*ck it!", and *dumped the whole bucket of Talent Dust on him* . And then she quit the job. This not only explains the insane talent of Ren, but also the lack of any other creative artist around nowadays. That's my theory, and I stand by it. All Hail the Talent Fairy. 🧚‍♀ Some say she's enjoying life on an Island in the Pacific, a cocktail in her hand, watching Money Game 3.
Cheers !🔥👏👏Ren I didn't think it was possible, to be brought to another level,more story than song, I was captivated. I'm here for it all, another room in the warren! Well done! KnoxHill break down, Bro?! Well done too! Nice to see the inside with the breakdown. Carry on... Thanks!🇨🇦 Looking forward to getting my copies of the album(and  vinyl)🍻
Genius, masterpiece, amazing....totally blown away.
Amazing to listen to and additionally entertaining like a movie. 🤌👍  Thanks Ren!!
Your songs always draw me in, you've got an amazing talent! Absolutely breathtaking, keep being you & keep smashing it 😍🔥❤️‍🔥
What a way to cap off the series, loving these 3 song trios!
Brilliant! I’ve not been so moved by a music video since Lazarus.
Bloody hell just keeps getting better and better, not just a song it's a piece of art, words instruments camera work absolutely mind blowing
🛹🛹🛹
Ren you play piano so beautifully, I would love to hear you incorporate more of it into your music 🎹🎶❤
Unbelievably excited to listen to this album on the way to work!!!
Goddammit Ren, this was amazing! Keep doing what your doing. Please stay true to yourself! Goodluck with your future endeavours!
Cool video. I know Ren has his own  prefered subjects but this time it's  redondant.
No words. Other than .. Stunning.
Another brilliant piece of work. Can't wait for my hard copy of the album to arrive. 🤙🏻
Fuxx sake man, this is fantastic! Your lyrics paint pictures with the skill of a master and your storytelling ability absolutely captures me. 10/10 Ren, truly!
❤❤❤❤❤ poetry is not dead
Wow
Wow as always a fucking masterpiece! This was an amazong piece of art ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🙏🏻
I love Ren’s self referential Easter eggs too…those initial vocals were very reminiscent of Jenny/Screech/Violet’s Tale…he’s prepping his audience that he’s telling another story of life & death. He builds on his own mythology, twists it and takes it to places none of us expect until we’re landed in the middle of it, then it’s like; uh, der…of course nothing else would make sense. He’s a lyrical, conceptual version of an M. C. Escher print. And then of course Sam renders the story into visually rich videos that are just as important to the mythological opus Ren is steadily building. Gentlemen, respect!
Decided to relisten to pt. 2 today, what a coincidence
Cinematography and storytelling at their finest.
Ren has fast become my favourite artist.  I can't stop listening to his music.  This is another fantastic piece.
Wow what a masterpiece in every way
Oi wow
As always the pacing, the display and the lyrics are immaculate. I still wish for them to be more like songs and less like theatre pieces since I just prefer to listening to those on a daily basis.
Brilliant and thought provoking. Art at its finest. Mind boggling. It actually boggles my mind. I don't think the boggles has ever been stronger.   Music, lyrics, videography. Top notch! Keep up the good work!
Keep sending the message guys. If it only reaches a handful of greedy rich people to change their attitudes towards money. Then in the words of your hi ren song..THAT IS A BONUS.
Just… wow 😮… respect ✊ you amaze us every single time but this… amazing!!!💜💜💜💜
Amazing and powerful - Ren you have done it again - every like and comment is due to your raw talent - wishes you nothing but all the best and success
Wow just wow....blew my mind .....finger on the trigger of a money game...rap god ren
Genius
Incredible piece of work. Take heed Netflix.
The legend continues 🙌
Pure brilliance, on the edge of every word.  Feeling the artistry & expression beyond 'entertainment'.  Divine connected expression.
You are getting There.
What I Love about ren's music videos is that they are done in one take and have no cuts (if they do, well done, did not spot them). No other artist i know does that. Very unique, but i bet it takes a lot of time and practice.
Wow
I  encourage anyone who hasn't watched the previous money games to go and watch. Also check out The tale of Jenny and screech parts 1,2 &3.
The truths that are told...
Genius!!!
artist.
What a finale, absolutely Fantastic !
Stunning!!
wow, the ending got me.
Just Genius , .Ren
This is such a masterpiece, love every single bit! The shots, the timing of everything, the details, the storytelling and the message in this are just awesome. Props to you and Samuel – and everyone involved! If there is a behind the scenes, I’d really love to see it. Great work!
I've said it all before, but you are a bloody genius! I can't wait to get your album!
Incr
✨⭐🧡 WoW ReN WoW 🧡⭐✨
41, I'm still walking. I guess I got that going for me. Ren is way to smart, I hope he goes far.
A true lyrical and cinematic masterpiece.
❤
Ren, you're an amazing artist and have a good heart. I can see you've been questioning why the world is the way it is for a long time. I pray some day you will find your way to the truth and be able to use your one of a kind talent for the kingdom of God. I promise you, all the answers are hidden in the bible. God's word goes deep. Evidence for the bible's accuracy exists, it stands up to any intellectual critique. The story of human kind, why God created us, why He allows evil, and how he sent his son, Jesus Christ, to die for our sins so we can become the potential that you, Ren, see in us. This world is not our home and no one will or ever has found the answers you're looking for, for a reason. From beginning to end the bible explains God's brilliant plan and the end is near. We are in the last days. Within our life times the events in Revelation will come true just as it is written. Jesus is the only way. What makes Christianity different from all the other religions? It is the only religion where the scripture speaks of prophecies, right down to the detail. The bible is over 30% filled with prophecies and over 80% of them have come true just as they said. No stretching the interpretations just critical study and critique, archeological discoveries testing that they are true. No other ancient historical text comes close to having the evidence of it's authenticity as the bible. The prophecies that have not happened as it says are still to come, and soon. Revelation tells us how the world will end. It describes the signs of the times and we are in the end times.
Some scenes remind me of my favorite painter Rene Magritte. Espléndido!!!
"I've lived all my Life with pain, So where is the point to complain? #Ren you shed ya words in my brain." The Oinkment " showers like rain. I've listened now again and again, these meanings and feelings the same. There's sooo much I want to explain, to tear and share what remains. Like breaking our bread together, this my Human last supper. I give thanks as I sit at your table, feeble and slightly less able. The parts that you serve are just fine, tales of Heaven and Hell are Divine! I'm taking this minute to find, my Heart Mind and Soul to remind....that Treasure is buried behind and it is ALSO Hidden Inside!" Thank you #Ren...for Everything x x x Now and Then x x x
Beautiful and terrible in equal measure. Truly captivating, Ren.  Hats off to you, mate.
I have immense admiration for your work! By the way, poor viola's bow in the final scene.
❤
Isn’t ironic I got a day-trading commercial after I watched this video
When art portrays life. Brilliant.
Why do I feel such despair??????
Rappity Rapp Ren is awesome, but Storytelling Ren is without equal. A beautifully poignant and deeply touching piece of art. And uniquely Ren. Bravo, sir 👏👏👏
I hope I'm able to learn.
WOW! I have goosbumbs ! U are completle underratet with your kind of ART! I thank you so much for beeing YOU❤
Ren will surely be on my Best Breakout Music Entertainer of 2023 list. 👏
You did it again mate, yo create a masterpiece that makes me feel by myself everything Jimmy feels during the video...awesome Ren.
I can only say in a world of music made for the masses. Ren makes music that goes beyond the masses. Art in its purest form, beyond words with this track and the predecessors. Kudos and well done, Ren.
I don't think I've ever left a comment before. But dude.. This is a masterpiece. I just had to say it.
The ending... Rain... rain...rain...
Wow...just wow! Incredible track, lyricism and meaning. Great work Ren!!
21ST CENTURY SHAKESPEARE - USING HIS INFLUENCE FOR GOOD, I HOPE WE THE HUMAN RACE LISTEN
Ren, i love your rap stuff but hi ren and money game 3 are fucking transcendent. You inspire me massively to write and paint and speak to everyone about the things that will be our demise if we dont change.
You can see the matrix code can't you Ren....
Sublime as always. I’d be shocked if it wasn’t at this stage.
Genius at work and what ateam production this puts chart music videos to shame , this team deserve some kind of award for this video ,,, btw literally just got a message saying SICK BOI album is on its way too me , I can't wait but I know nearly every song word for word lol 😂❤🎉

Amazing ❤💋
You are a legend keeping alive story telling through music like the bards and always releasing relatable content or even just eye openers

Is that a cut at 5:36?  No dissing at all, just curious. It's a fucking masterpiece regardless.

Wow, what a masterpiece
I don't wanna die. I'm tying to live. Life has much to explicitly explain.
1M views in 12 hours. More people recognizing the talents of Ren!
I wanted to ask a question on Twitch last eve, but couldn't actually word it I was that tired!   I suppose I can ask it here as I don't want to spoil anywhere!    Is it REALLY the end of Jimmy's tale?  I don't know an awful lot about g*ns, so I don't know which one was used at the end of MG3, but...   There were 5 bullets on the table and Jimmy only loaded 3 of them.  At the very end of the video there was only a 'click', no shot.   Is Jimmy still  playing the Game?  Sending love and peace to all. ❤
Omg! This was Amazing!  Ren is a Lyrical Prodigy who Uses His Words & Videos to bring to life Everything!  I love everything Ren Does❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
❤
This trilogy is gold
Would love to see a magical colab between Ren and Lin-Manuel Miranda. I can dream about it ...right? Like a magical theatrical, musical masterpiece!
A masterclass in storytelling, musicianship, and performance art. Ren the musical isn't too far off from a west end debut. Truly one of one.
Did not dissapoint, incredible and so true
Greay work as always. You never disappoints and make me wait for more. love it mate
Thank you
The word genius is for people like you
Fucking goddamn genius
Never seen such portrait of reality in a song so well-made like this. Masterpiece. Thank you Ren
May i ask you? I have growth on my face I can't find anything about. It's started to hurt a lot.
Here comes Thomas Shelby from Peaky Blinders
Who was the 45th? Did he have father issues?
How is this not on a million views yet?? Come on guys let's make this happen asap 🙏
Ren you’re a genius, you’re talent is incredible and the way you use your platform to share powerful messages is applaudable. One of the greatest artists of our lifetime ❤️ Please keep doing what you’re doing

Some Music Videos and songs hit deep and some hit DEEP. Amazing stuff Ren
MASTERPIECE…… no other words needed 👍
ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL REN
BRAVO, BRAVO Master Ren. You my friend are the Shakespeare, the Mozart, the Picasso, the James Dean and the Socrates of our time. Although I thought it would be ‘Hi Ren’. This masterpiece HAS to be your Magnum Opus. And I feel privileged to be alive to witness it firsthand. I don’t know where you go from here, but I can’t wait to find out. ❤️✌🏻🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Sam you are like Robin to Batman or Watson to Sherlock. It is an absolute joy and a thrill to watch you and your teams work. I am a fan and can’t wait to see your business expand to other projects and artists and to see the product.  Amazing guys. Once again BRAVO 👏 👏👏👏
What a song and video! I will be interested to hear soon if this is edited on the album as the breaks may not work without the visual, but wow what a way to round off the count down to your 2nd album's release. All the best with it Ren, I hope you chart high and wish you all the success you deserve.
This world could learn a lot from listening to Ren.
Thank you
Algorithm
Art, pure art!
Oh Ren, this is mind blowing. You are the artist of our time,  I hardly know what to say. You are a genius, you are everything, everything. My heart is pounding. I am so happy for you and Sam. Perfection my dear. Much respect and love Ren 💖💖
i saw money game and RAN to watch it
Genius
This is awesome!
I've watch this vid like for tone back to back❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉😂😂😅😅
❤
WOW!! Nothing but pure awesome!
Holy shit that was incredible. Every time I see something new it always seems to be levelled up from the previous. I honestly don't know how you will improve upon this masterpiece but then everything I have seen has been eye opening. As a 48 year old metal head I thank you for dragging me out of my comfort zone and experiencing new music whatever the genre.
Amazing as always ❤️
I never expected any piece to touch some strings like Hi Ren did. And it would be unfair. And I love or like most your music, and if it’s not my cup of tea I can still see and appreciate massive talent and quality in them.  Well, this, besides being exactly the size of Hi Ren has The size of Hi Ren. Different strings. Same size. It’s amazing, well done all of you guys, so much choreography to do this is 1 shot, unfkingbelievable. Emotional, smart, crafty, oh so fun and provocative.
💯💯💯
I’ve had to watch this several times because the video is so good & I couldn’t listen properly 😂 such a great song & video. Another winner 🇦🇺👌🦘
Sick Boi, received thank you ❤️ No.1 iTunes UK this morning beating Rick Astley 👍❤️ We’ll never give you up Ren 😂👍🇬🇧❤️xx
Your music/art is medicine. You have such a gift - this world needs you X
Amazing as always Ren!  I am gutted i missed the premier.  Best of luck on your new album today
It's astonishing.
Your styel is amazing
truely topped the bar for Money Game 4, can’t wajt
The composition as always is awesome, the lyrics are great
" I don't believe the world is a particularly beautiful place,  but I do believe in redemption." Colum McCann
Damn
Wow. You are truly a beautiful soul that is very talented. I personally appreciate you for bringing your words to the world. Only a select amount will be able to listen for now. Hopefully more than needed. Not sure if you ever come to California or Nevada but if you do I would greatly love to meet you. Maybe even get to interview you. Thank you
This is insane. This is fckn insane.
Wow, just amazing!!
I was stunned, I was baffled, I was shocked, I cried.
Damn! This was absolutely incredible 👏🏻 he's a master of his craft.
Genius!
Said it before…. REN is the 21st century Shakespeare. This is other level story telling, far beyond music, it’s rhyming art, a truly magnificent piece on for me one of his best… his observations of the world we live in are astounding when turned into prose like this….incredible….
❤❤❤❤❤❤
As an iranian, I have a lot of love for ren
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
No words to describe well what i hear, what i saw, sometimes someone is able to sing with all the things he have inside. Thank you Ren , i will live another day waiting the good one to be finally happy.
This is one of your best song 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Speechless!
just unreal !
Wow. Ten you keep on raising the bar. Thank you. Everyone share this please. We need the world to see this
This is honestly insane, been a fan since hi ren and somehow everytime  i listen i still get goosebumps❤
I was engrossed in every moment, taken on a journey, my heart was in my throat, goosebumps, hung on every frame, note, word, I literally held my breathe near the end. Stopped breathing, heart pounding, Tears streaming down my face, seriously Epic 💗. I am sitting here reflecting, contemplating and processing, imagery reflection in the piano, mirror, rain scene, string music sound 🎶🎵 beautiful, loved ❤️,concept, imagery, camera work, seamless, pain, tragedy, how words echo and repeat, narcissist, toxic, generational trauma, story telling, words,Truth and deep meaning, Watched and listened a second time, Impact. Deeply thought provoking on many levels. Powerful is an understatement, brain processing, nerves literally vibing electric. Wow
Wow there are some things in line which are so special that you can’t describe it. Thank you Ren 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🤟🤟
Just WOW
😍
Perfect work
When you are speechless, but want to say something because algorithm.
So excited to be but one participant in the social experiment leading up to this release. The wave of emotions, the vicarious victory,  the love for everyone who collected to collaborate... then to have this Masterpiece to memorialise the moment in history.  Ren,  Sam and everyone who made this perfect piece of art and videography... my respect is deep and wide.  Joe, Vik, Jake and all else who  assisted in the magic of TMG you're part of my extended family now.  Part of a collective consciousness,  and part of creating real change.  I've learned a form a collaboration I never thought possible.  I hope we all lived up to your expectations, I believe that we may have.  I know this is but the beginning, and your all my sisters and brothers in this journey. Let's not forget this moment. As a whole we have started something beautiful.  Ren your music has changed the way I see myself and my place in the world, it started with Hi Ren but reframed my past and my future. Thank you for giving me such a beautiful community, for making my world bigger and less isolated.  Thank you Renegades for your support and love,  you're the best ❤🎉
It’s just the best art being made on the planet 😮
Chills....
this hade me in so much suspense but it was so worth it
Whatever you do is exceptional That is art
9 minutes feel like 2 minutes
🔥🔥🔥
oh my god another stunning and mindblowing piece of Art! I doesn't matter what you are doing... if it's a catchy song like loosingIt or a deeper song like dominoes or even this kind of "music-theatre" like the tale and now this one. For me... first impression was... sounds interesting... then, ok really cool and as teh song progresses I got caught so deep int this story...  really  Ren... there are not enough words to describe how impressive your music / your art is I am also so deeply impressed by the video itself. @SamuelPerryFalvey ... you are also a genius at your business :) All of you are making everything so great! THANK YOU
Wow..... love it
Damn that's quality ❤
It's a masterpiece... You ARE a masterpiece
Maniec...... WOW
Ren, you shattered this! Start to finish,  keep it going
what a fantastic performance and experience ! Such a d*** shame ! Self reflection and wisdom on an exponential progression !
ASHA IS  !!!
This is the Ren I knew! So glad to have a full piece again!! Love everything you do but these are top of the top
Crazy Song Ren ❤
How can so much be done in one room in one take with a camera that has no reflection? Stunned.
😮 We hear you. 🥸🐷
Art
i had no idea ren was absolutely sick with the piano
Didn’t breathe for 9:19 minutes. In tears. Thank you Ren, for being. I… I just can’t find the words to describe this piece of Art that involves so much passion and Hope for humanity to open their eyes or stop Being affraid to step out of the money game. Been a “poor” individual my whole life and at 33 I realised I have all the wealth and power inside of me. I am grateful of finding an Artist like you Ren, who is teaching how it is okay to just Be whatever, the whatever that is good for the greater idk what. It’s all about our reactions, mindsets and the energy makes it happen, so let us make it happen.. in the best possible way. I swore to see you one day Ren, that wish saved me from… yeah. Can’t wait to get the album and am investing positive thoughts with honesty, that you recover in the best possible way and start touring or just performing live in some way.  Much Love from Slovenia from River moonmoon of the Moon😂 aka Nath
WOW
absolutely amazing, production, lyrics,writing, performance, subtext and the videography of Sam, fucking chapeau 🎩
This one was mäh for me 😅 part 1-2 was 10 time better in my opinion
Ren you never fail to make such amazing music, and all will a meaning.
This is bloody brilliant, REN you are so talented and I can’t wait for SickBoi. Thanku for honesty and sharing.
Dude.
❤😢another masterpiece leaving me in tears. Hugs bro.
Wow i found this because of recommendations of the part 2 great
Eeeh ren!!!!! This is brilliant 🤩
Outstanding again!
Dude you are just like an open vessel to endless talent from a higher power, you keep topping yourself and those are very high standards to pull off but your doing it!  Amazing man!
shivers....  uh...  this guy is just great...
Another masterpiece!
Uch. HiRen and Janny,Screech and Violet were masterpieces, this for me is crap.
❤
What a depiction of the times
It’s got to be hard to carry the pressure of a artist to keep providing art to the fans. I’m ready for part 4 now..😂😂
Genius! Hope you`re doing well. Wish you prosperity and more such a wonderfull storytelling masterpieces!
This was amazing! Now I need to rewatch all 3 parts 💣💥
That pianist is amazing. Amazing song too
Another masterpiece Sir. Much appreciation, endless respect 🙏
Bravo!!!
Ren! You are literally the most deep and brilliant artist of our day!  ❤
Ren and NF....two of the best in the game!! Y'all need to tour together
Greatly anticipated and well worth the wait! Thank you for this and for all you do. So good... Actually EPIC!!! The whole series is masterful. Can't wait for #4.
.. W- WOW.
This is true art. Amazing.
Incredible, watching the progression of Ren for years to now has been an honour thank you ❤ when music becomes art becomes poetry it becomes a masterpiece x
This is amazing
This ending is so brilliant - Hit us with the thought provoking lines.  And knocks it all down with that subtle Money Game chorus without using the words.  Remember Money game part 1/2 - A subtle little way to end on the chorus we all know with "rain" from the sprinklers without using the words - "With his finger on the trigger on finger of a money game - Rain, rain rain, rain!"   On a sidenote - Ren can we please have a full release of the instrumentals with the violins - It's an amazing sound
Masterpiece of art! Once again, I am impressed by 1 of my favorite artists, Ren ✌️💙🎵🙌
Preach it brother! 🙌
Can’t lie, I was wondering if you could ever reach the pinnacle of ‘Hi Ren’, this is there absolute master piece, true art and entertainment at its highest. Thank you.
yoo this fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm a big fan of Ren. Trotsky - not so much.
👍💯    💲🎰 pt 3  What an trilogy 🎉
Genius
No words. ❤
ABSOLUTE BANNNNGERRRRR
Mindblowing.  You've done a lot of amazing stuff together, and this is one of the more stark and stunning pieces.   Well done, Ren and Sam and everyone else involved.
Freaking Hell, Ren, you did it again, and went above and beyond. Too emotional for more words other than thank you for pouring the depth of your Soul into your art and making art that matters. Much love, bro.
Excellent stuff. Love the story telling as always.  Was a little disappointed at the lack of trigger discipline with the pistol but all in all, another banger.
Best yet ur a fucking genius thought it would be hard to beat hi Ren but I think you jst have amazing your like no one else love it 🎈❤️
Literal chills. The cinematography, the composition of the song, the lyrics.. I knew there was a reason I make sure everyone has the opportunity to discover your gift. I set my expectations for you very high, yet you still manage to blow it out of the water, every time. Well done, congratulations to you and yours Ren. Generational talent indeed. I feel blessed to be able to watch your journey
Said it before. Saying it again.  This guy may have been through hell and back again But this just helped him forge his raw talent into god tier skills  Props Ren
Wow lost for words incredible
Goosebumps for just how much you've grown and for the truth of those words, you are a talent that seems to grow with wisdom and compassion and i hope you keep growing. Much love❤ and respect 🙂
That is art at the highest level.
Woah.......
you do it again .
With a world so godamn intent on tearing itself apart through greed and corruption, the Money game series shines a light on the darkest of the situation, points a finger right at it and boldly says it how it is.... I applaud your brutal depiction Ren. You are what the world needs right now, honesty in a world of lies!
So many words come to mind watching and listening to this…spellbinding…mesmerizing…FANTASTIC!! Ren doesn’t disappoint again! Not that I thought you would, this even exceeds my expectations! 🔥❤️👏🏼👏🏼
Jeez..
this is spectacular, I truly have no words worthy of describing your music
Discovering schizophrenia in Romania, is so mixed up, hope to get wealth, for everyone or more. Take care for yourself, bro's and sis's and more.
This is a crazy talent everyone should  Know. It’s crazy How much you have improved over the years. Your talent is a whole new level. Please don’t stop it. You’re helping a lot of people.  Cheers from Denmark!

Back to shake up the world Cassius Ren clay
If this doesn’t get “video of the year”, then the system is obviously rigged.
This blew me away. The song, the setting, the camera work and Ren performing it in his usual exquisite way. No one can do what Ren does. Bravo 👏. Now rest Ren! For more than 3 hours.
Thank you Ren. I mean it.
This isn't just an amazing song and more personal followup to part 1 and 2, it's paired with an absolute cinematic masterpiece. The single continuous shot, the rocking camera as "Jimmy's" illusion of control of his life starts slipping, the absolute SHATTERING of the fourth wall towards the end. SCREAMING rn.
Pure talent, message, storytelling, musical skills, so well performed. ❤ We have only seen the beginning.
Amazing story telling. Honest and raw. Song and video of the year. Hands down!
Damn.... just, damn...
Superlative!!!
Ren ❤ totally Amazing!!! Lots of love n light always xOx ❤❤
Also smashing into
A pure masterpiece.❤ Hats off to everyone who made this masterpiece come to life. 🎉
New Ren-RenNew my drive to befriend the monster within
Love the echo to the Tales of Jenny and Screech in the dying moments of this piece, ‘Hears the words of his father, “it’s such a damn shame” ‘ …..
Been looking forward to Part 3 for ages))
The best video direction so far. Masterpiece!
Pure poetry, a modern time chester, who entertains through epic storytelling, tales of modern man in all its bleek glory and pain. The inner narrator we all needed to take a good look in the mirror. Thank you, REN!🙏🏻❤️  Poetry in motion.❤
Thanks for the words and messages of truth. Just that is beautiful in itself.
Mind blown again ! Genuine gifted prophet …. Love your work Ren …. You’re needed in this era ❤
Ren is the honest angel, he can show us the right path
Oh my gosh! Epic, again!
Ren music videos ❤
This is amazing, very emotional, i love the imagery, the poetry and the music, definitely pulls on the heart strings, i cried just as much as i did in Hi Ren.
I've said it once. I'll say it again. You are on the list of top favorite artists of all time. It's absolutely amazing what you and your team do with the music and the videos. Keep up the amazing work.
Ren, I’ve followed your music from the start and you keep getting better. You’re a genius and this is a masterpiece
Holy shiiiiiiiiiit! That was incredible!
Fucken wicked. 🤯
Best Ren song
Should make films amazing
serious.... mastership!!! respect !
That video was sooo great ...  ❤❤ sooo ready for my copy of sick boi to arrive!
When recommending this: "shh just keep going, we'll watch it again I promise. And again."
This needs wayyyyy more views. Let's get this to his #1 most viewed video.
Amazing.. every piece of art I hear from Ren is uniquely special
so good
Watched yesterday and my first reaction was that it's too short and then I saw 9 minutes and 20 seconds, I am sorry we are so demanding as a fan base 😂😂 an excellent conclusion to the money games(if that's what it is) if not where's the next one "mine, mine, gimme" much love from Gibraltar Ren❤
💪❤💪
Every frame a painting. Every stroke an intention. Every lyric a poem.   Once in a generation.
❤❤❤❤
Ren & Sam.....Holy Shit. There's few times in someone's life when I feel art finds a mountain to shine from, I feel like the roles are reversed with you Ren. Art comes through you to others, you as a vessel to amplify the message, you're accomplishing exactly that.  You are amazing please let the story continue to unfold. The gun Jammed, gave Jimmy a second chance, what's the  story from 46-70, 80,90?
Exactly how I see the world too. Brilliant  piece of art. 👏
It is honestly insane and so impressive to see you go between all these different genres in just one song. You are a modern-day Shakespearean poet and I am here for it.
Holy hell, Ren. That was brilliant.
Wowzers! That was amazing! ❤
Wow...this is...wow
Another Ren and Samuel masterpiece.❤  Heard this first on Spotify. It didn't do you justice. This production is 100 time better.
Bruh hands down you're the greatest Musician on this planet earth.
How can one man be so damn talented at not only music but art in general from storytelling to production and spoken word.
🧡💥🧡
d0pe
Fantastic performance👍👍👍
Fantastic.  Keep it up Ren!
Borders may be what you call an "Invention" however allowing anyone to enter your life, your home, your city, or country can be more danger than you can handle. Borders even emotionally can be good, so long as you use them correctly.
this is a good one!
Bravo
This is sick, boi
I’ve never experienced such masterpiece. Nothing else to say really… just… wow.
This is art. And art imitates life. What he's speaking is the evil and greed in us all. It's been there way before capitalism or socialism or communism was ever a thought. Our animal side wants to take. We have to rise above our base instincts and be civil towards one another. Even if nobody is looking and no one would find out what u did. You must have the integrity to do the right thing, even if it doesn't benefit you in your view, because it always benefits to be kind and help those in need. It benefits the world when u lead by example and be a good example to others.
Great
WOAHH
Damn this is great
❤️‍🔥
Great, Greater, REN
Love the theatrical aspect of this, a whole live performance done in this fashion would be a game changer.
someone on here said it first - 'witness the return of the bard from times of old ' - good to have you back old friend.. : )
Well that was amazing.
Ren did it once again ❤
Music with lyrics that tell a story, like back in the days of neil young and john lennon.  Great work team and ren <3
Awe, I was hoping part of the countdown intro was still in it, that was art in itself...
REN doing REN things, class
Thank you
WOW ‼️ 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 …Too TRUE 💔
OH MY WORD!!! Pure excellence 💙
WIIOOOOOOOAAOAHAAHA
the art... the detail... everything
MG3...So many levels of amazing creativity. Grand slam!!! Congrats to all!  Can't just watch once. always find something new to love. Excited to share . .... "A single stone  cast in water creates many ripples" ..Ren you are that stone. Great message on twitch today. I  also dont have the answers but share in your views. " We are the change".  Very much  appreciate your compassion and voice. Thanks for all you do..100 % support
Let's go 🎉
What's my solution? Noise pollution!!  Missed a chance to pay homage to Pop Will Eat Itself.
And I make everything about my brother, but 22 is when he ended his life, with a dad who pushed him so much as my brother programmed at a nuclear plant. He didn't want it, he wanted to make games, music, but his rich dad kept pushing him. He was done. This is too real and I'm in tears hearing this especially hitting 22. I'm 31 I was the hood sibling, my brother was a rich man's pride but hated it. One trigger pull and he escaped.
This is art!
Fuggin crazy talent this man has. wow!!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I absolutely love this
Ren you're killing me in my favorite way thank you
Damn, left speechless as usual! Absolute genius,thank you Ren, Sam and crew ❤
You inspire me mate
Wtf, just seen it for the first time and this was my immediate thought. "What....that was 9minutes? Na, felt like 2 ffs. 😂 amazing
He gives me a Cillian Murphey vibe.
The album opened #1 on iTunes in 16 countries today.  Though Ren doesn’t chase  numbers, statistics or stats, it is still damn impressive! ❤
👏 👏 👏 👏
Love it! 😊
I just realized, in part 2 he said “while my finger’s on the trigger of a money game”. What if all 3 money games are the story of this guy self reflecting and dissecting the system that brought him to where he is now in his final few moments before he kills himself?  Jesus that’s dark
I need a few more "play agains" to digest this.
Powerful message! Love the classical influences. Ren aims at the ❤ of people. ☮
Yes yes yesss! Sorry my comment wasn't more articulate 😆.
That should have 100 million views !!!
Another piece of brilliance from the genius of Ren and his team. Awesome masterpiece. ❤
Ребят, извините, но это охуительно. Вы тоже слышали Рахманинова? Хоть бы это не было пиком в творчестве Рена. Достаточно серьёзная планка.
Another bloody masterpiece!!!!! Probably one of the talented people I've listened to. I mean that
Well done,Thomas shelby! Lol but fr talented young lad Ren!
Got damn!
Woow this is insane
Many thanks to Ren and everyone involved in the song and video!  🪞  #Ren  #RenMakesMusic  #MoneyGamePart3
Ren, Sam and everyone else involved 👍magnificent 👍
I'm speechless
This kind of talent is unbelievable
You are unquestionably the most lyrical and unique artist in my lifetime. This song is a masterpiece
Another masterpiece....

I need a ren workout video man is built
Sweet Jesus Ren, another incredible masterpiece. 👀🤯🔥
Amazing, every verse felt different to me. Had a lot of Hi Ren vibes for me as well. Really love your music, keep em coming, they help us out a lot here ❤
storytelling at it's finest! BRAVO.
Diiiiickaaaaaaa
This in my own opinion has been the best song released by ren in the last year
Dam!!!   That gets me thinking…..
I love this. No, you won’t read a sad backstory. I love this and Ren so much ♥️
😊😊😊😊
Ren, for your next piece, due tomorrow and needed yesterday, your social commentary on the Israel/Hamas slay, is it propaganda, mainstream media truth, aren't we simply minds being played, millions of eyes listening to you and what you say, break ground and release your vision I pray before we fall forever entrapped in their dystopian daze. You can do it, stop the madness, the game of which side we're on. I stand with is this real and maybe peace can come our way.
Wow 🩵
Your story telling is just so electrified and moving. I can literally feel my heart beat and the adrenaline flowing. You push against the walls of the barriers of music and you make them move. I cannot see where your excellence could get any better. Thank you for not only pushing the boundaries of music but the boundaries of peoples thoughts.
Flobots- Handlebars vibes. = )
Ren for President - no need for another actor ;)
You should be called renoir as in the artist. Masterpiece!!
Incredible talent!❤❤❤ this has me in awe! 🔥
Welsh genius 🙌🏼
oh my god you beautiful, beautiful soul, I fucking love you so much <3
9 minutes and 19 seconds of goosebumps. Wow. I"m speechless. No comment can capture the feeling this video evokes. PURE ART!!!. Congrats on a masterpiece Ren. ❤ from Alberta. 🔥 🔥 🔥
Wow! This is right up there with Hi Ren, in fact even better! Excellent performance, excellent videography. Sam and Ren kicked ass on this!
Why did I pass the premiere😩😩😩
I cant believe it man out did himself again
dammit oh dammit you cook it you fucking cook it let's go the money game.
Wow
I love how mine ended with an ad that said: invest up to 10k into the stock market today!  An absolute masterpiece. 🙏
I caught this early by accident
Bro…. Master piece ❤
Ren... friend... brother... you've outdone yourself.  Oh my god, friend, this is incredible.
This was insanely brilliant,  this is true art,  true expression and conveys such a powerful message that we all could do with a listen. Bless man your a legend keep on keeping on!
¿ɐɔᴉɹǝɯɐ sᴉ sᴉɥʇ
Wow
I don't know what to make of this one so many truths in under ten minutes wow just wow
Your ability to say the things that need to be said in such powerful poetic way never fail to bring me to teats... thank you for your gift to the world... ❤
Phenomenal!
What do you mean second ever album, you've been killing shit for years, you've had all singles, that's why you never had like 5 albums so far and still had 5 albums worth of great material... you wasted your time on singles.  Love you Ren, but you've definitely released way the fuck more than 2 albums by now.
Yeah!
I don't deserve to be alive at the same time as Ren, but I will bask in it for as long as I can.
Easter Egg - It's the same length as Hi Ren - 9:19
I’m just here for the show!
Wow, I was lost and didn’t even believe when you came to the end.  This is right up there with your other masterpieces of art/music/spoken word performances.  Ren I loved it.  Samuel captured the intensity and the energy superbly.  🎈🎈🎈
👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏
Awesome, fantástico muy bien hecho mi amigo. 😃
This is amazing. Ren deserves to be on the big stage. He is a pure musical genius
45. Some lines had the vibe of Donald Trump’s early years - or symbolism of.  The end appeared to reflect  becoming the 45th President of the United States.  The above being true or not, I loved both the song and the video. Part III was worth the wait! Just got my pre-order!!!!!
Thanks Ren
Top tier
Am absolutely speechless. Congrats on another amazing video. You are truly an inspiration.
Aww shit. here we go again.
This is the real deal
Okaaay my mind is blow😍 Love this masterpiece production. Thank you for your life and your talent! 🖤
FINALLY SOMEONE SAYS IT!
All I have to say is, REN the next doctor
I don't feel it's hyperbole to say that Ren is one of the most important artists of this generation. His music is so important and needs to be heard by everyone.
Thanks Ren for the video, loved it.
This is so well done 9 and a half minute feels like 2.
Ren is truly a master of combining narrative, unique cinematography, excellent musical talent and communicating a moral to a story we all must learn before it's too late.
Not often a music video has left me absolutely speechless, but here we are. Ren did it again
And another one! Killer track.
Ren always hits deep. The videos, lyrics and instrumental inclusion is insane.
🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼
This century’s greatest poet right here.
It is literally a work of art 🙌
Nice love it
Why do Ren songs hit harder on each time I listen to it.  ooooof....too much truth in this one....
Outstanding - true art with a timeless message. Bravo!
"The Hippy Trilogy" is complete
Damn that's some good work. Reminds me of Dogville or something in it's rawness. Stage lighting not hiding anything.
Very intelligent storytelling. Great job 💌
Incredible, genius, perfect!
Never has an artist made 9 minutes go by so quickly!
Awesome bro. Kinda got some Bo Burnham vibes
Brilliant again! 👏🏼 🔥 💰 🎮Always speaking truths about our socioeconomic world!!
So fucking good
Amazing! Worth the wait.
Ren’s music has brought me so many emotions and it has been a pleasure being on this journey with you
This was...eclectic, in all the best ways, very much enjoyed the broadway/classic feel to this
The storytelling on this one is just something else
Holy fuck... haven't played much Ren before.. this just made me a die hard fan. Ren... this is fucking straight genius.  You're wordsmithing rivals Scroobius
Wow! Just wow!
You are AMAZING Ren!!!!!!!! And the ending went full circle. Incredible.
Wow... Just wow!
Absolutely incredible art you've made, gave me chills.
im just listening on autorepeat, this is awesome🔥
I just can't  ....... my God, I'm speechless.  🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Fucking awesome as always
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Love it till it hurts
A work of art .
The amount of symbolic meanings in all these is crazy.
Always Enchanting; insightful with a Beat for the ages!
“Damn” Literally the only word that came to mind when this ended! That was Art!
Absolutely fantastic! I was so enraptured by the entire song that I could hardly believe 9 minutes had already passed. What a wonderful piece of art and I can’t wait to see what else you create.
Why such passion into one video, you're amazing.
Neffex drops Modest Ren be like:
been listening to you as far back as blind eyed and depression. let me just say its an honour to have been able to see you grow as much as you have. to be able to listen to your music. you make masterpieces my friend keep it up.
Art
🧞‍♂️ genius !!!!!
*slow clap*
Bravo 👏👏
To the moon 🌚
Truth ...........
Holy $hit!!! Damn Ren, this was H-E-A-V-Y and spot on. God bless you, stay well, and keep pushing the truth, wherever it lies. 🙏🏼❤️✌️
This is an absolute masterpiece, the emotions it compels a person to feel is insane!!!
That was, really incredible. I love the message, the performance, everything about it overall great job. Love it
Brilliant. Also, somebody enjoyed the final season of Succession. 🖤🖤🖤
Leaving a comment for the algorithm, because wow💛
This.....Man, this......Was a movie. It was art. The parallel to our early years was heavy. This was worth the wait!!! Brilliant. Congrats to you and your team 🙌
I generally only listen to punk...and I've seen this over 5 times ...yes I've been down and around the rabbit holes..... How many times have you guys watched this?
Already another "right in the (h)ear(t)" hit. <3
So much packed into 9 minutes. As always, Ren makes you feel AND think. Thank you to Sam, Ren, and the entire ensemble for creating art
This song was truly an amazing experience, and the way Jimmy's story built up to become the personification of the chorus of Pt 1 and 2 without directly was jaw dropping.
PS wanna do a blues tunes? I play a mean gob iron
Wow. Tip of my cap to you my boy . Rens gone and done it again💚🧙‍♀️💚🇻🇳💚🇻🇳
Thank you Ren for changing the world of music as we know it and for helping so many others cope with life as we know it now. This is a true masterpiece!
EPIC...EPIC...MUSIC IS MUSIC..WHEN EMOTIONS ARE RAISED....RARE NOWADAYS.....REN IS ARTIST WHO MAKES YOU THINK....THINK..THINK MORE....AND STIRS UP CONFERSATIONS....A TRUE ARTIST....AND SAM BRINGS THE VISIONS....TRUE ARTISTS BOTH.....
Ren, another spectacular performance.  I say performance, because as brilliant as your music is, your videos transcend into rarified air to a theatrical and visual feast that could, with little effort, be transformed into storytelling in London's or Broadway's finest theaters and concert venues. Your work is like a hybrid rap opera and everyone needs to know your name.
Who’s playing the piano?
Another powerful song, message & video from Ren. What an incredible work of art! ❤
This is true art .
Capitalism sux and you've  shown  us how and why! ❤
This couldnt come at a better time
This is brilliant. Thank you, Ren.
This is a masterpiece
The storytelling in this video is incredible.
The piano and your voice struck me with chills right at the beginning. I'll always look forward to what's next! Your my favorite and this was just another musical performance that was captivating. Way to go!!💙👍🙌🙌🫶👍
That's what modern education and the mockingbird media does to young men, drives them to despair.  I'm kind of shocked Ren fell for it.  Brother, your take is what I was fed and what all young men in the west are fed.  It's wrong.  Like all good propaganda, it contains elements of truth but truth twisted into falsehood.  Let's take money, for example.  Yes, there are those who will stop at no atrocity to enrich themselves.  That is absolutely true, you can see their loathsome fingers in the military/industrial complex, in the halls of governments and the offices of enormous pharmaceutical companies.  And, yes, those who obtain riches earned or unearned, often self-destruct; money is very difficult to handle, it amplifies weakness, flaws and addictions.  And yes, there is evil wandering the world.  But that's not the whole story.  That's not only what money, or people, are.  Money allows me to get stuff I want without killing someone for it.  It allows others to get stuff from me without killing me for it.  Money has allowed humanity to lift itself up out of the bloody claws of nature and even out of our own nature.  Like all tools that powerful, money can be used for good as well as evil.  It's just that it is the job of the mockingbird media to seek your undivided attention and the trillions of small, good deeds, acts of bravery, kindness, compassion... those don't gain views, clicks, attention.  Violence, injustice, tragedy do.  And so that is what's shoved out 24/7/365.    It's a distortion of reality.  Don't fall for it.
Your artistic brilliance paints the pictures that run through my mind daily.  Only, your art has power that conveys beyond measure
This is fantastic.
Wow
Brilliant, as in illuminating🌟🌟🌟 Gorgeously choreographed  cinematography!!! As a fellow rhythmic wordist I thank you for saying it all our loud in such a beautiful way. You have impeccable timing... bless yer steps Ren and friends!💖  🎶🙌🎙
Dang!
REN put did himself with TRUTHS  this time!!!!!  Excellent for all to hear!  Keep up the great work REN as you totally ROCK ❤!!!!!!  Brilliantly done, BRAVO!!!!
Bravissimo!
Fucking rad Ren! ❤️🖤
Wow
Rain, rain, rain  The storm it comes our way  And those who rise through distorted lies…..poising our brains
Yiza
Wow you did it again Ren.. You make me laugh you make me cry I wonder if you'll make me die..... We love you so much Ren... Ten out of ten again brother...God bless you sunshine..
You’re an absolute genius
This is just great. Love it ❤
Cool
I feel like the world will look back on you... in years to come.... as starting something.
Wow

So far it's longest song in my playlist...
Whoa... this may be your best yet. Absolutely incredible, and so many important messages.
It seems like the songs get longer and deeper every time
Holy shit! The talent is just amazing! Lots of love Ren and Sam❤
Wow, as usual! I know you have a message, not just here to entertain, but you’re one hell of a showman Ren! Your flow’s insane
*Slow clap*

That was an amazing story... Holy ****
This was incredible. The cinematography was incredible, so was the instruments and the lyrics. You've done it again.
Genius.
Wait 50
This is brilliant. Thanks for sharing the genius you're blessed with.
The most important 3 songs for a decade. Just amazing lyrics, delivery, video, production, acting and all with a very concise message. This is Hope for the human race and this planet.
Awesome stuff brave in form and content.
Wow, just wow. Thank you Ren
😈❤️👍
Ren wow. You have outdone yourself with this one!
Funny shade of blue  He used to laugh  bruises turned a funny shade of blue I, I, I and the sky knew, There'd come that day, And I'd never miss you  Do as I say, not as I do, Your clever, toothy glare Bend over the bed, pull down your underwear Metal yardstick bent in half Fire in them eyes, the devils staff  Theres lessons to learn Sometimes they burn Rot in hell bitch Rot in hell  Its cool tho  after twenty Ya just lose count Shh quiet down, you know your not allowed to shout Too loud....you want more? And you know you don't wanna buy.... From that party store  The lessons we learn Sometimes they burn Rot in hell bitch Rot in hell  You get used to the schoolin Cuz that smile ain't foolin fuck your little looks All learning don't come from books Tho ya wish they could. And maybe they should Ya learn to feel alive some where 'round twenty five  The lessons we learn Sometimes they burn Thru the glass the sun shined Not for you tho Not for you  Have a drink Stir in a few a mommas helper That smile again Ain't no shelter That special time is here again And it's not a race meant to win  Man  those lessons 2 learn Sometimes they burn Those that can't do teach Those that think they know preach Rot in hell bitch Rot in hell  Found time to smile with the Little breaks,  Shoot off to grammas for heavens sake She knew nothing of the losing count Rainbow colors there Covered in underwear But she knew of the pills Tho ya just don't talk  Cuz a big fire starts from that little spark And you'll  only lose your only safe park Where the flowers grow where the sky was clear Like a bird you could fly  feelin normal there  But weekends always end Like the money's we spend Back to those eyes Back to gray skies And you hope something's changed Less medicine, less deranged A little missed ya, happy to see ya No just a reminda  Don't forget the rules Or back to the  blues Don't be a fool This is home school  And ya know the lessons we learn Sometimes they burn Cuz school ain't over, till class ends If you're smart don't tell your friends Rot in hell bitch Rot in hell  Thank you Creator for time goes on by Flipping my finger at him He met the sky And that funny shade of blue And  your mean Ol eyes became you All bets are off I never, never, never became you.  Still  the lessons we learn Sometimes they still burn Grown man now Its lessons learned My babies won't know That funny shade of blue Cause the greatest lesson I learned Is to not be you. Rot in hell bitch Rot in hell.  Thank you Creator for time goes on by Flipping my finger at him He met the sky And that funny shade of blue And  your mean Ol eyes became you All bets are off Laugh out loud I never, never, never became you.  And you know you kept score When you tell that whore You'll never ever touch me no more. And that funny shade of blue Always funny to you Doesn't touch my skies Glad you done past on by Sometimes it's true When the kid says I'll never miss You  M.McNeil apr2017
Its a masterpiece Ren
Bravo REN My mind was blown away... AGAIN!!!
😂 🎉 ❤
The start was really good I loved the piano but there was a lost opportunity to make it more of a song rather than a show of theatrics, would have loved to see a scratchy violin rap at the end rather than slow paced walking talking or even having the piano come back with a bit of guitar. It really could have gone places
He is that genius he claimed to be!  ❤
Love the message. Brilliant.
This man is genius!! Definitely my favorite artist your amazing REN thank you
This man is genius!! Definitely my favorite artist 💯 your amazing REN thank you
AMAZING!! Again!
Song makes me glad I let my kids know they are loved. love is not based on what they do.
Damnit I wish I was that sexy 😤
powerful stuff
Amazing job on this one 👌🏻
Such an important message performed with amazing skills.
MASTERPIECE ALONG WITH OTHER MASTERPIECES HE'S  DONE. TRULY TALENTED AND ONLY GETTING BETTER. BROTHER YOU DESERVE ALL THE RECOGNITION FROM ONE HUMAN TO ANOTHER IM ECSTATIC AND HAPPY YOUR ABLE TO CREATE FOR US TO ENJOY. THANK YOU & GOOD LUCK ON ALL YOU WILL ACCOMPLISH.....
Let me say it for everyone.  HOLY FUCK!!!! @RenMakesMusic
Man, this is amazing. Loved the message
Wow.
He gets it, refreshing to see. Divide and conquer watch them go down in flames, until life tells you to do the same. Thank you Ren, be well!
Masterful
Brilliant
Holy fuck! This one is a stunner. Thank you.
WOW!!! Just WOW!!! I think that's all that needs to be said!!!  Thank you Ren...
Ended too soon! That was the quickest 9 minutes 19 seconds ever. Great work! Now I need to watch it 20 more times to digest it.
worth the wait I can tell you put alot of effort into this 🎉
Pure musical and lyrical genius at work!
Holy fuck. This is a whole new form of art....amazing
This afternoon, for the first time in years, I wrote. I wrote to try and work through this tension I've been struggling to articulate my whole life.  Real "what's my life's purpose?" level stuff. Because I'm 50 years old and been blown on the wind to date. Years of taking the choices offered to me instead of making my own and calling it wisdom. Ignoring the voice inside me saying "you've got something to tell."  It's something I've known for a while, but haven't understood (or been too scared) to bring it forth: Humans are creator "small g" gods. I say "small g" gods because we can't change the laws of physics, and it's hard to buck probability, but we create our individual and collective reality with the choices we make.  I'm certainly not the first to think this. But I am constantly surprised at how few of us LIVE this. I've known this "secret" for a while and I don't live it. Ren (like many other of our greatest people) not only lives it he's calling on us to live it too. That's why I love him.  We need more people to live this truth. Because the world isn't going to get better until more of us do. We've let weapons-grade sociopaths steal our power, cow us into not wielding it, or fool us into using it to serve their desires instead of our needs.  That's what I hit on today, before I watched this video. My purpose is to convince people to claim their power and live as the creator gods they are. Fuck if I know how I'm going to do it yet. I'm starting awful late, might die before I realize it. Might be the worst possible choice for my material well-being.  But Ren does two things for me. He inspires me to get off my ass, and he gives me peace in knowing I'm not the only one with this goal. If it isn't me it will be someone else. It will be Ren, or some kids who learn from Ren, or all of us finally waking up, and using our power.  Ren gives me hope.
More fire from Ren!
I have no words.................wow.
OMG! ❤❤❤parch enfawr! Lej🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
Wow
Glorious!
True Art and genius.
So dope brother. Glad to see you getting the recognition you deserve!! Been following, waiting for you to blow for a long time for real.  I had a mad creative idea for you for another  series of songs. You should do something along the lines of peaky blinders, you looking alot like thomas shelby! Theres so much you could do with it(wonder if you could legally do it) ive thought about it a fair bit and had some awesome ideas, as writer/actor/director i can already see how amazing you would do it. Anyway would be cool to link up and talk about it. But maybe atleast you'll see this and come up with an idea on your own. Would be amazingggg man. Love you bro.
This was beautifully thought out; musically, visually and poetically. Lots of different moments, great pacing, nice rhyming, with thought provoking points - all told around this well constructed hyperbolic story with a bit of a plot twist too. Video is intense and the scenes are raw. I was so happy to react to this one.   The whole Money Game series has been a great journey for me. There's just so many thoughts that pop into my mind, so many different topics that we can go down the rabbit hole on. I love how a few minutes of song can trigger hours of conversation - whether it's internally or with someone else. Then the effects of those conversations can last a lifetime. Sorry for the book, but I don't think I ever showed my appreciation directly through the comments section - Usually I just stick to the reaction videos but that means I never get the chance to think of a proper way to say all the things I'm thinking. Keep doing you Ren
Ren, we're never disappointed.  Powerful and sadly so very true.  Your absolutely correct we need to pull together, as a people we need unity, alone we are nothing.....  👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
absolute masterpiece.
I hadnt heard of Ren an hour ago. Now im on a journey and my jaw is still on the floor. Putting the art back in music. Im still trying to process how amazing this guy is. Just WOW
Dope.
I love with how he opens with Paganini’s 5th caprice arpeggios.
Just ThankYou!! Absolutely brilliant what an artist
Congrats to you ren. Captivating on this level. Absolute 🔥 heres to hoping that all/some/ or even a few listened, and tranform into a better version of themselves. I included must do better. Thank you
💯
The choreography in these videos always impresses the hell out of me.
This actually gave me James Bond vibes
Well damn!🔥🔥🔥
This is INSANE! You are a damn genius! Ren, thank you for you’re creative thought processes and pointing out so many things that somehow get pushed to the side! Love ya brother
This a whole different level of pure talent!
A true artist. Every song is just a story and so full of raw emotion.
Incredible!!! Absolutely brilliant!!
This man makes my spirit rise,   ❤️
Damn
“He learns that the truth is just an obstacle to wealth, if you manipulate the data then a lie will sell itself”  REN’s songs are a treasure trove of quotes, it reminds me of one from part 2:   “it doesn’t matter if they hate you if they all say your name”  Edit:Typo
@REN, as a lover of all the music genres of the world and a self-admitted music snob that is very critical, I think that you are one of the greatest new artists to come around in many years. You are so gifted as a musician with a creative mind that is unparalleled. I am ALWAYS moved by your songs and song writing.
Masterpiece
Pure genius…. Seriously REN you are amazing
Listening to your music rekindles the fire inside that started when I graduated from metal to punk in my mid teens. Bad Religion changed the way I listened to music. You carry that torch and keep the flame bright.
Please come to Alberta!!!!
Dayum! Perfection as always.
This kind of makes me want to cry, because I can't see humans changing in time to save humanity and the planet.
This wasn't useful
Stunned. You are an incredible ARTIST Ren.
The same feeling watching this as the first time I saw Hi Ren , mouth open , speechless 😮
Wow
Ren, we need people like you now more than ever. Thank you for your art, your poetry, your honesty, and your boldness to call us out on the darkest parts of our lives. I may not be Jimmy, but I know well that any one of us could be given the right (or, wrong, I guess?) situation.
I've been waiting for this one
My congratulations to ALL that participated. 👏👏👏 The video is simple but so complex at the same time. Just mind blowing, the performance of all, the scenery, the light, the rain,etc... just....out of this world. 👏👏👏👏👏🤙🤙🤙🤙
You're 🤯; I'm in love
Holy Shit Ren... you sit are one of the few capable of fostering large scale change. Nothing but love brother
Im so foolish, here i am thinking you wouldn't rock the modern world with goat grinded muse
Name me one of the greatest artist of all time and why is it Ren?
I hope this message reaches the ears tomorrow’s..Political, Economic and Education leaders. As their greed for Power and Wealth is destroying us all.
I am // shaking // . Speechless.  i am taking a moment to digest it all.  Both of you did a beautiful job and I am so happy to be able to hear&see art this way
AMAZING!! Thank-you REN (and your entire team), for continuing to deliver amazing art.
Wow! Thanks for continuing this mind bending journey. Absolutely astounding work from your entire crew. Can’t wait for tomorrow.  Cheers.
Phenomenal ❤
My muse.
Bloody brilliant. As always needs 10 listens to get every level. I've never known an artist who inspires so much reflection.
The thing about your music Ren, is that hearing it for the first time is ultimately a sad experience because you can never hear it again for the first time. But at the same time, the tenth time is as good as the first or even better. You've created the ultimate creative paradox.
What a fucking coincidence I relisten to part 2, only for this to be recommended from 7 HOURS AGO.
We get to watch something really special unfold with Ren and his career. Violently underrated and deserves to be at the top
Incredibly talented folks. Fantastic.
I couldn't find an emoji to represent the emotion I'm feeling rn
thats dope broooo
Holy shit Ren!!
Just wow.
Sick
WoW !
Great work Ren. Every ounce of work and effort is recognised and appreciated
Total proof of artistry and having a substantive statement.
Good grief, Ren, take a break, that was incredible.
Brilliant.
Woah…👏👏👏
Truly amazing Truly brilliant Truly real for really real...u r truly all of the above Ren💜☔💜
This wasn't a music video this was an experience
Yo... mate...This is such... fuck yea... Brazilian Fan here!
Fucking hell Ren you did it again mate...Goosebumps and tears...
amazing
Keep it coming Ren! Absolutely cannot wait for the album to drop!
So lets just say I don't normally comment on Youtube Videos, but I just had to on this one. Ren, has stood out to me on so many levels that only some I have  noticed. This dude, Ren, my guy, you have impressed me beyond ends of what you might even possibly believe. Both, your guitar playing, vocals and songwriting, flow and lyricism, This 3 parted Song Collection structure you  impose continue to blow my mind! part 1, part II, part III. I just know that I like and enjoy it an awful lot, Please note this comment was written a mere 7 hours and 5991 comments later you are sitting at just under 150k view thus far.    Ren, For real, hats off, I say to you, Bravo Bravo, this is yet another masterpiece grouped within a collection of trinity masterpieces, add that to your pocket. . 2/3 of your famous trinities :) keep doing you. Don't ever stop, and you'll be just fine, which I assume you must already know in your mind somewhere...salute! hope to see you one day performing live, meet you. and perhaps jam a little something up... Just a Dude with a dream from all the way across the "pond".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         - $illoet

Masterpiece,Beautiful.❤
Excuse me while i pick my jaw up off the floor. Wow, im speechless.  What a genius you are Ren
BRAVO!!
Ren is one of the greatest of our generation.
true artist
Fuck yes
Ren isn't just a modern musician or artist, he is a bard, holding a mirror to our selves.
True masterpiece!
Ren you are an inspiration
Ren I love you, but I can’t help but think you misunderstand human nature - people are evil and inherently broken it’s not society and education that is the solution it’s a grounded moral framework in Christ
amazing
🔥
These 9 min feels like 90 seconds. Bravo
Here I am, just trying to live my life.  Then this happens.  Thank you Ren, for reminding me I am just a mortal.
Wow, I am a 45yr old guitarist/musician and artirtist named Jimmy, FACTS... Mind completely blown. Ren you are an angel and we are privileged to have your gifts of music and art, and self help that you've provided for all of us. You saved me!
Wow; just wow 😮. The message, above all, is brilliant. You are one of kind. Your wisdom is beyond your years. Thank you for sharing it to do your best to wake the world up and shake some sense into it. Nothing but GOOD can come from it. You’re a kind and generous lad. Thank you for simply existing. Your presence on this planet is a blessing. ❤
Good
just...no notes  perfect
Wow. Everything you do is amazing.
You start to take this song for granted, but once the 9 minutes is up you feel sad. You start to appreciate its meaning then.
Ren is a Master Piece Factory fer Friks sake. He is gonna be a Tough One to Beat People.
Ren is Iconic
Thank you. You put the pieces into Queensrÿche operation mind crime. WTF.
This combined with the treasure hunt live stream and the Money Game game have all been FANTASTIC! Ren is something new.  He's refreshing, and it seems like he's surrounded by a crew that can get things done.  Ren deserves exactly what he's doing.  Changing the face of popular music into commitment and messaging with compassion and creativity. There's still room for the fun stuff, but I've been waiting for what Ren's delivering for a very long time. Well done Ren.
Algo and rhythm bh00ster  I'm in tears.
Not as catchy as part two, but holy hell the video. The video!
Incredible
I randomly looked for part two when I saw this came out 7 HOURS AGO!!!
Amazing, a man who isn't just woken but well spoken. The lyrics, choreography, the scenes, the musicians, and the message makes this great masterpiece.
It blows my mind how you weave in so many mediums of art into your storytelling.
Thank You Ren!
Oh my word...........😮
What can I say: pure art!
Amazing bro!
I knew this was gonna hit hard, but damn
Stunning 💪🏻🙏🏻💫✨
Un...Believable!!!  Masterpiece!!! Well done lads...well done indeed.
Do you know what a prophet is, Ren? A prophet is someone who tells the truth to the masses, especially hard truths that nobody wants to hear. This is why you were broken as a child. God broke you to prepare you for the life of a prophet.  Edit: Here is my true question though. I'm sure you're familiar with Kintsugi, the Japanese art of repairing pottery with precious metals. You are a broken vessel. Will you allow God to repair you with His most precious metal? Will you allow the Christ in, and make you fully into Kintsugi?
Am I the only one who couldn’t help myself say “Oh, rain, rain, rain, a storm it comes out way” when he said “Presses on the trigger of a money game”
Never ever commented on a YouTube video before but time to break the mould... WOW!!! Absolute genius! Been awake for an hour and watched 3 times and the Knox breakdown! Legend!!
Rad🤘
Holy shit what a trilogy ,, ren you are brilliant. I'm 61 and never heard anything like your style,, keep it up 🤟🤟🤟
The genius continues...   I am constantly amazed. Thank you Ren!
❤❤❤
Shit goes hard mr money man
Masterpiece ❤
Interesting! A very different approach on the Money Game trilogy. The first rendition was more theatre than song, similar to this third version of the song. It makes me wonder  if this will be free flowing like Money Game 2 was!?
Another masterpiece - can hardly wait for the Spotify drop AAAA
Happy Release-Day or whatever it is called. Good Luck and enjoy the Day :)
I'm glad people are listening to Ren, I wish everyone could listen to him, such an artistic way to give a message
Very few people make me proud to be a part of the human race. You Ren are the best of us & restore my hope in humanity
Thank you a lot Ren and Sam, and all the other People workin on that Masterpiece.  What a great one! And what a great shit Money Game World we live in.  Music is love! Music is understanding. Music is communication. Thx for ya Music.  care for yourself and ya loved ones People!
How the hell did Ren just produce yet another genuine masterpiece? Mindblowing.
Top tier from ten again
Fucking Hell man! Got Shivers down my spine! Fantastic!
My gosh! I’m going through one of the worst moments of my life but watching this supernatural talent restores my faith in life! I’ve gone through so much these past few years through losing my partner of three kids and suffering from depression and anxiety etc!!! Just like what Ren talks about in all of his songs, when I’m feeling down and want to give up I just play Ren and it gives me hope and faith that I’m not the only one hurting and going through this pain! My kids also love Ren too and love his songs from hi Ren to down with the beat lol but there’s I few songs they can’t listen to because of certain things and they always say please dad I love Ren can I listen to his new song but I have to make excuses as to why they can’t. Ren is a true artist who can speak to everyone of all ages! This guy is one of a kind and artists like this do not come around all to often if at all! I thank you Ren for all you have done for me over the last 8 months since I’ve discovered you, you seriously do not know what you have done for me! Thank you so much!❤❤❤
I LOVE THIS
masterpiece!!
Using "sheep" to describe selfishness is a clever way of reversing the way it's typically (and incorrectly) used by the exact type of person described in the song
Bro, I just watched an entire movie in 9 minutes.  Maybe it's me, maybe it's Ren, he does it again and again and again.
Outstanding.
What a trip. Ren and sam just keep getting better and better. What a masterpiece..
keep up the good shit x
I did not breathe for 9  minutes and 20 seconds. <3  This is amazing.  And heartbreaking. And real.
If you watched ,at least leave an emoji for this piece of art. ❤
Nice. Love it. Your songs have brought back my love of music.  Thank  you.
Wow .... just wow 😮
Brilliant piece of music and poetry. Absolutely loved it. For real. But, this is a very naive and young perspective. Conservatives don’t take more than they need for themselves. They do it to help the ones they love and provide for their families. Which is, taking care of their herd and what’s best for it. What’s spoken about in this song only applies to the ultra rich. Not the middle class who just want to have a happy herd and plan ahead to make that possible. Communism doesn’t work. It’s been tested over and over again and when you start throwing around words like building utopias, you sound like a young communist. Not saying you are one. But that’s what you sound like. Cheers mate. Thank you for this fine art.
Dalhe. Brasil love this song
The lyrics brought imagery that sent shivers to my soul and the visuals on the MV resonated with me. Another work of art!
Reminds me of The Arrangement by Joni Mitchell and used in the movie when Kirk Douglas tires to kill himself from a similar ennoui. You could have more than a name on the door.
Brilliant. Everything about it. Profound.  Excellent job, brother.
Did anyone else hear Ren say "45" in the middle of this essay on greed and immediately think Trump?
bro started rhyming like eminem
Chills... every tune...
All I gotta say is thank you. Been loving the journey since I met you. Never met someone that I feel questions life like I do or maybe more. It's been a blessing, thank you again from the bottom of my heart.
This is awesome. What an amazing depiction of the rat race we're all in. Talent and authenticity are off the charts as always. Please keep being you and sharing your art with us brother.
A true masterpiece. Performance of the year!
🤑😵
pre-ordered my copy. Thank you Ren best Birthday present so fare and it's going to take a lot to top it
Another comment for the algorithm. If Pride wasn't one of the seven deadlies, I'd say Ren should be proud of what he achieved here. I can't imagine what it felt like the first time he saw the completed MV.
Thank you sir!
My dear Ren.  My name is Eden. Suffering from Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, BPD, ADHD, anxiety, panic attacks, depression and PTSD from all the trauma i have from when i was a child and a younger adult.. lets say Violet's tale is pretty close of what i had to go through and I don't need no pity. I hate it. I'm just ok with sharing my experience to maybe inspire other to free themselves to talk about it and see that they aren't alone... BUT still living my life to the fullest or at least trying my best and somehow my people are wondering everyday how am i so optimistic and look so happy even tho i have those episodes which is a little to often that i feel like my world is shattering around me. I feel like it doesn't matter what you went through it's what you decide to do with it. It made me who i am today and if i didn't went through all this i wouldn't be who i am so as awful as it was im kinda thankful cause it made me ME. Everyday is a battle but I'm trying my best to get back up and fight. I have amazing friends that deals with me and support me everyday. If you mind yourself enough you see that you can do so much more than you think... Ren you inspire me and your music is good for my soul. You are truly a genius. Love participating to the money game and making friends all over the world in the process... Love you with all my heart. I live in Canada but im ready to travel to UK if ever you do a show!! Thank you for existing really 🦋 Btw i am french as hell so sorry for the typing mistakes LOL
Just Wow!!! amazing musically, storytelling, cinematography..a blend of all !! Yet staying original!
Absolute MASTERPIECE.
MASTERPIECE
Holy Shit. That is powerful! Well done Ren!!!!!
Masterpiece!😎
Fuck that was good. Like part 1 and 2.
A whole movie that cuts deep into our sick society, what it teaches us wrong, why it is how it is and why it needs to change. Desperately. It is in our own hands. Demise or salvation, death or life, truth or lie.  This piece will go down in history as the beginning of our awakening. At least I hope it will.  It is up to us now. ALL of us.   Thank you ren. I already said it a million times but I say it again: I love you from the bottom of my heart. You feel like a sibling to me at this point. And in a way you are. Hope you can sleep tonight, rest asured you did something incredible today. I am proud of you. And joe is too.
Another masterpiece Ren and Sam!
This is absolutely amazing. Ren, Samuel, Beau, and all involved, you've simply outdone yourselves
Fmd this is good ❤
Ren just keeps growing, advancing, elevating his game...and the world is better for it.
Wow!!  Didn't know what to expect, and as usual, Ren dies not disappoint!!
What an artist just What we need much love fri sco bro keep ascending
Algorithm baby
Answer to the riddle: there is no suitcase! 😂 It's the pining, chasing, lusting for more and more that is leading us along a path of suffering for ourselves, others and the planet as a whole.   Learning to let go of the illusive suitcase full of money is part of the journey to escape the toxic Money Game.
This is straight crazy, a masterpiece
Knocked me off my feet, still can’t sleep, watching every reaction, every time it’s much the same, absolute FIRE!!🔥😍🤯
dude every time you surprise me. great ideas you have
Brilliant
Absolutely incredible.
serious ideas for serious people.
How do you so perfectly encapsulate exactly the thoughts and battles I have been having for years? I hope your ego doesn't get huge...  because you are an absolutely AMAZING artist and I think you finally know it now :P. We love you brother. Keep fighting the good fight.
Wow that was impressive! Definitely some twists & turn in the story.
Amazing man. Words are so true
Masterpiece...
Incredible videography wow
I love it!  ❤ In true Ren fashion,  we got an amazing work of art!  I love the song, the message and the video itself. It's just soooo good. There was a crispness to this that just works. Ren, you look  good in that suit (I know it's not about that but) you just look very sharp.  This fits so perfectly with the other money game songs.  I've only watched this once so I'm off to watch again.  Congrats! The music, the cinematography, the set and the players are just beautifully orchestrated.   Peace  ✌️
Ren and Sam.  Take a bow.  Holy shit.  This is a masterpiece through and through.
Wow
Can't wait for part 4
Bravo good sir… BRAVO!!!
As a nobody from Germany, I can only say I am disappointed! The album has just become available. Only 18 tracks? No, seriously now... I haven't been this excited about an album in about 20 or 30 years. Well done Ren! You deserve the success and every good thought, wish and penny you make from this to keep your art going.
We all knew the line was coming, so of course you save it for the bitter end, and what a bitter end it was.  You deserve all the success in the world and I'm sure with your grounded perspective, you won't let it get to your head.
Is this a story rap about Justin Trudeau? I mean Justin Castro? Damn it, I mean Hunter Biden? Damn autocorrect…
Man I love everything this man touches
Amazing
Absolute masterpiece
Another masterpiece performed perfectly ❤
Still trying to find the words. Bravo
Love it!!
Bravo to all members of the creative crew that made this masterpiece👏
i am lost for words after watching this and covered in goosebumps.. if only schools would get students to do a thesis on this song before leaving school. For reals if i was a teacher i would do this. So much to learn from these money game songs. As soon as my daughter is old enough i will be playing them and having a very long discussion about them. She is only 5 at the moment but even in 10 years time this song will still be relevant... even 20 years and 50 years it will still be relevant.. But maybe just maybe if we do our very best to teach ourselves and in turn teach our kids through example sometime in the future it wont be... Thankyou Ren you are truly an inspiration to what we can hope and what we can dream about a better future for all much love from Australia xox
god DAAAAAAAAMN
#25 trending..we need to do more
Sick piano intro
Ren for PM.
Sam and Ren thank you for this beautiful piece of art♥♥♥♥
I cannot wait to see reaction pieces to this masterpiece.... so honest, so true... truth in art. What a beautiful sorrowful truthful piece of magnificence. Much love to you buddy ♥️🇬🇧♥️🇬🇧♥️🇬🇧
MASTERPIECE!!🤯
Masterpiece
Wow
406 seconds in and I’m like ohhhhh yeah!!
Wow, this is absolutely incredible, so powerful!
This is beautiful. Well done!
20 seconds in… amazed!!
Wow, wow, wow! Absolutely brilliant Ren and Sam!
Soul shattering! Good mental health takes so much more than the individual. Capitalism is a sickness making many vulnerable to the destructive powers of greed.
Piano  keys... Ren is a crazy other thinker amazing talent he's gonna get some huge collaborations soon I reckon
Holy crap! Wow! This is powerful.
I gotta say I was nervous about this. But wow you surpassed expectations.  Never happens anymore. Third movie is never the best, This is a masterpiece
she sells seashells
Out of this world!!!!
The brilliance of Ren and his team is stupefying. His words, masterful. May we all truly hear them.
aw fuck yeah
Nice SUIT❤
Wow..this is like nothing I've ever seen or heard before. Absolutely fantastic !!!
Another take: Borders are not a human invention, animals have territories that are patrolled and if another crosses them, they are fought or killed.
Fucking excellent
I love you and I won't dare tell you how to live your life But I hope that your platform, and how they have already commoditized you, doesn't *change* you. Remember who you are.
Hauntingly beautiful. Ren...Sam.. no words can do justice to express the emotions I felt as I was listening. Glued, at the edge of my seat - even caught myself holding my breath at one moment. An absolute masterpiece. Thank you Ren, from every fiber of my being, for sharing with us - you and your art. Straight to my soul..clinging to every ounce of me. I have never experienced goosebumps in such a way that I just did. Just beautiful mate. I hope you are so very proud of yourself. This is one for the books. Bravo!
This is definitely about bidens son
Sometimes I forget the power you have to transmit great messages, artistic, melodic. Sometimes I don't measure how fascinating the lyrics, beats and flow that characterize you are. Sometimes I forget how I started following you, but now I remember, Money Game and Ren, it's a before and after on a musical level, which also means a lot on a personal level.  Your work is what life means to me. Keep going, boi🔥!!!
At first I was a little sad that we didn't get the hook, but by the end I didn't care. Truly a work of art.
Once again!  There are really no words to describe the power & presence of what Ren does. He is the bard of our time. Thank you Ren for sharing your genius.
Dope.
You should seriously consider turning your album into a broadway musical.  It is so theatrical.  Amazing production quality.  Wow.  Speechless.
Thank you. Great stuff! You are such a huge artist!  And this video is really well done too.
Those 9 minutes passed by as literally nothing. It was so freaking well-paced, I didn't even noticed. That's insane!
Absolutly 100% totally fukin brilliant.... This is the new way....the only art that really counts... Soul searching ....soul destroying truth..!!!!! Bring the house down Ren...every single brick... Reveal all that we have become...pull back the veil.  You are the new Messiah...
Who else thinks 4:22 has influence from don't hug me I'm scared?? If anything it reminds me of the duck. 😂😂
This is SO chilling, such a beautiful representation of how money is the root of all evil. amazing amazing amazing!
to whom it may concern, i audibly and involuntarily said "WOAH" at the end
To Ren: Your ability to verbalize and visualize the mess that we have created is unfathomable. To say great job is not nearly enough, I think thank you is the only way to convey what I and probably everyone else who has viewed this needs to say. I am praying that your health is returned to a level that will exceed your doctors anticipation. I say that because I selfishly want you to tour so I can witness your art in person. Many blessings my friend.
Ouroboros has an end this time around. It is we. Yes, you and me
Are you kidding me?  Again?  How does this young man do it?  His creativity is absurd.  Talk about perspective.  Reminds me of Jesus words, "do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroys and thieves break in and steal but lay up for yourselves treasure in heaven (relationship with God and others for real meaning)
An absolute masterpiece. What a ride it's been since I discovered your music! Continue to rise and inspire millions! You are a gem, Thank you, Ren.
Holy shit I’m shaking
Ren, I love your art, keep going bro, don't stop ❤
JENNY, SCREECH, VIOLATE AND NOW JIMMY
FUCKING BRILLIANT!!!
Thank you for providing….everything that you and your crew do.
❤
Great job on everyone’s part. The message was to the point on many levels and outlook
❤
Eyy im from Argentine. In where place can i traduce in spanish this masterpiece?
Wow. That good sir, was brilliant.
Thank you Mr. Gill for biting commentary on modern society. You’re a breath of fresh in this seniors life. Live long an prosper.  Love, Doug
ren, you take my breath away every.single.time.
Oh.. my... fuck.
I love the way I have no idea what I’m going to get from you and at the same time your voice/style is instantly recognizable.  Thanks for being weird, for being new, for being brutally you.
Fuck me. That was really good.
Amazing!!!!
How did you make me care about Jimmy so much that i cried? Because hes just like us, we are the same, some have money, some dont but we all suffer that hole in our spirit because we know something is missing....humanity and community...thanks man
Video of the year😍
Dude!!! I didn’t like them ending!!!
Wow!!
So beautiful. Ren is brilliant. His evolution in this singular series is awesome.
It’s a powerful thing to cause a person to think. You, sir, make people think.
I just remember money game today and I just saw that this video was posted 6 hours ago man what kind of psychic power!
Wow!
Whew! That was stunning and powerful. I'm gonna need some time.
As usual,  artistic masterpiece!
Fuck dude. I uh, I felt that heavy
Love
I love your music, your piano, your words and songwriting with storytelling and so one. I just love it. "And we devide..." - so true... 😢 We all love you Ren 💜 and caníbal Minds are so strong words... With so much meaning. I can't tell you how much you are speaking from my and ours hearts.
sososo impressive, i'm speechless
This Is not just music this Is art
9:07 it's the 3rd part, but you can put this behind the 2nd one and it fits perfectly!
Holy shit ren in a suit looks great
wow
9:07 RAIN RAIN RAIN RAIN, A STORM IT COMES OUR WAY
My word
Worth waiting for, brill.
Awsome song. Just ordered the CD. Keep up the good work, I love it. Question if you see this, is hi ren on any of your CD's? I think I have them all so I guess it's no, just wanna make sure. Godspeed to you sir.
🔥
THIS IS AWESOME
Ren never dissapoints!
One word: Quality. From beginning till the end
You were right ren the best one yet.
Been watching since money game pt. 1 and it's so poetic to see this trilogy end(?) like this. 9 minutes of Ren is just what I needed today.
So much more than just music or entertainment! A message that needs to heard by many. A warning to be careful what you wish for! Well done Ren and Samuel!
Brilliant
Sorry but WHERE is the Grammy for the best song and music video?
Absolute goosebumps!
#Ren, say it loud brother. I love your album. Hope it reaches No1 worldwide, exactly where is should be. To all the RENegades big love and virtual hugs, hope everyones doing ok in these turbulent, destructive times. Seems every day the tears flow for the innocent people all over the world dying at the hands of a few. Like Megadeth said...Peace sells but who's buying?
Another Shakespearean extravaganza of truth🎉💪🎁🖖🎶👑🕺🌟⚡❤️‍🔥
Wow!  Love all!   All Love!
Speechless 😳  This is a Masterpiece!
Ren Gill you really should consider taking your music/performances/storytelling to the stage! The West End and the World. So many people you don't know are super proud of you and wish you nothing but happiness because that's what you give us all.....happiness
This is still giving me chills. An absolute masterpiece 👏
Incredible once again!
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Amazing
I feel like i need to watch this a dozen times,  right now! ❤
FANTASTIC
Been there done that nothing new. Yes money is the root of all evil. Showing folks a way out. Way to go 👍
This is so amazing 😢 I love your art so much ❤
"For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and yet loses his own soul?"                                                         MATTHEW 16: 26
_"Swallow all your morals, they're a poor man's quality"_
this is sick!!
Abso-fucking-lutely gorgeous. Beautifully shot, beautifully acted, poignantly scripted, soul crushing and meaningful and an ode to nihilism all the same. Bravo Ren. Bravo.
You are a legend!!!!!!!!!
“When perspective evolves” -  that’s the line for me in so many great ones entwined amongst this masterpiece - Ren, Sam & your amazing team 👏👏👏👏 hats off, tears welling, thoughts swelling & perspective evolving.  Thank you 🙏❤
uh......... wow
Brilliantly done 🌧️ 🌧️ 🌧️ 🌧️
REALLY GOT TO MEET THIS GUY ITS MY STORY 2:47
This is simply phenomenal...
Holy crap!!!
The movie “Ghost story” the video “This is America” the feel of “Dance with the devil”?
👏👏👏🙌🙌🙌 another masterpiece and message ❤️
amazing
Bro, this is a masterpiece. From the cinematography and progression to the music and lyrics, y'all absolutely nailed it!
REN is the definition of what having a social conscience & self awareness means, it’s no coincidence this is his time because the world wasn’t ready for him until now! Now the world needs him!! ✌🏻❤️🇨🇦
Ren. You are just simply a legend, In all forms of life. This is beautiful, and your musical skill and love is unbelivable.
Wow awesome
Top
Thank you so much Ren for producing another Masterpiece and helping to recreate Community worldwide.  🌹👍❤️👍🌹 🥰🥰🥰Love from Canada🇨🇦
Intense! evoked my emotions!
This is brilliant. I've always enjoyed music that tells a story and you bring that to a whole new level.
I love every single part of this song, bravo!!
There are so few musicians left where you wait for the next release, knowing that it will be a masterpiece as always.
These types of songs are your wheelhouse.. you are incredible Ren. Thank u
Art
Very well done, absolutely brilliant! That took me on a trip that leaves me a bit fatigued with reality...And that last bar...
This just reminded me of the beginning of the Smashing Pumpkins..Today is the greatest.. day I’ve ever known.. artists don’t exist like Ren.. he just is in an entire Master Class of his own making.. I just still can’t wrap my head around it it is simply indescribable.. Thank you .. Thank you.. Thank you Ren!♥️🎶♥️x😊
LETSGOOO
Finally content which force brain to work and not melt! Bravo!🎉
Goddammit Ren, now I have another song I have to memorize word by word lol
This isnt music its something different!!  Ren Thank you for captivating me so many month's ago with Hi Hen and then he journey of discovering all of you music and Ridiculous talent !!!!
LETS GOOOO
Holy shit. Once again you’ve killed it on a phenomenal video. You and Sam are like bread and butter. Your story telling is nothing short of WOW. I have goosebumps. Trying to process it all. We don’t see eye to eye but I will say that you always give me something to think about and I am always impressed with how you think. Keep on keeping on Ren. I’m again flabbergasted with your gift
This is some of the deepest shit I've ever heard. The words are spoken truly. Not unruly just remember the pain
Absolutely amazing, I have goosebumps!
I really don't think of Ren as a musician, he's more of a storyteller. With words (and productions, with super talented people suporting him) he drives you through an experience, he tells the story, dressed as something of a "watcher", denunciating the sheer cruelty of this world, warning the dangers of hate and greed, but also giving us hope and a solution. What an honor to be able to experience the pure genius of this artist!
Love it
This guy just doesn't miss... Awesome job again Ren
I LOVE this!
beastttttttttt
Ren your ability to tell a story and make people feel every word is amazing! This song gave me all the goosebumps and hit my heart like a brick! Keep doing what your doing cause this is definitely what you were meant to do!
I have no words to express how amazing this is. The visuals, the lyrics, the camera work and the message!!! Well played sir, well played.💜🔥
Keep it up man, your crushing it!
I love the colors!
holy shit
René Magritte reference at the start. the lovers. Awesome
So few artists are genuine enough to give us such a unique experience as this.  Masterful.
👏 👏 👏
jjjj
Holy fuck, you keep out doing yourself.  What an absolute masterpiece you've given us!
This is amazing!
Well done sir. Something to be proud of. One can take Pride in ones work. Thank you for using your faith and never giving up. There is much to say. Take care sir. I hope you get everything you need and maybe a little of what you want.
Had me on the edge of my seat every second, you never disappoint with your craft!
5700+ comments and 132k views..and still not on youtube trending?? wtf

This is a masterpiece! INTENSE. Love from Tasmania Australia xx
❤❤❤
Part 3
Amazing
Masterpiece
This. Is. A  Masterpiece.
I need a few deep breaths. Poetry has a tendency to seep deeper into our soul. Add a little music, that drives it to the Core.
Jesus. Sublime and powerful.
wow
Thank you.
phenomenal
He did it to me again. He drew me in to remind me that there are people out there that have all the wealth but I scrape by unknown and unloved but that can change. I never want to be rich and famous.
Fawwwwwkkkkk!!!! and Ohh! that was a compliment btw
Oh my fuck.... This is amazing! Love the whole thing from the lyrics, to the music, to the fucking amazing person who shot this so beautifully! 💜💙💖
This is amazing.  Your music moves people so deeply.  Masterpiece  Thank you.
Jeez. All 3 Money Games strike nerves in different ways
The gun took me
Wow!  Ren is speaking the truth to all of us!!!
Never misses , Sam and Ren do it again ❤️❤️🔥🔥
You are truly something else, a true gift to this world.
Yikes
puto genio❤
People forget that walking is a gift
This is one of those rare times I actually watch, full volume, no reading as I watch, no multitasking. Well done!
Parralel to "hi Ren", this song is the really next step, specially the footage. This step up is too good, same intonations voices, cinematic plan with simple but smart idea (for the cuts), the lights, framing, focus and story. I think the budget is much important, the result is near a masterpiece!
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH REN WTF AHHHHH THAT WAS ART!!!!😮
Ez egy mestermű! Greetings from hungary 🇭🇺
Wow, I started again from the start of the videos. I just do not know what to say. You are so creative and your messages are so meaningful. Hoping many people listen and learn. ❤❤❤
No way that was nine minutes. The real question though is how do we end this money game?
Do they give awards to independent artists. I mean this is kind of fit for a film festival. Sam deserves an award. This is great work!
Wow!!👏👏👏🤯
Holy hell, shivers
👑🖤
This is perfection 👏👏👏👏👏 hopefully YouTube will push this to keep others finding it also
Love the use of real instruments, keep it up
Ren your a story teller an such a talented writer,singer, rapper...ext. Beautiful
Well played
Holy shit Ren that was deep .that makes you reflect on everything you've done for money even if your story doesn't come close to matching jimmies. So I'm waiting for this Netflix show to start brother
This gave me chills, it's so true. Genius.
The music hasn't kicked in yet but somehow i know i'm gonna ❤ this track!!!!!
Well done son 👏
Brilliant! Another masterpiece, REN!! A modern-day Shakespeare, or ShakespRen.
Fuckin’ dope, brother !
This is a first. I have never had such high expectations. I was certain REN would meet them. I didn’t expect those expectations to be blown away. I guess I should have. Congratulations to REN and SAM and every single artist involved in this. Wow wow wow!
Every version is absolutely incredible
Chills
The ending made me breathless. Was not expecting this but it was such a powerful message.
This was epic, Ren! Wow.
There is no way... is this a one take?
What a flow man
Genius…
🐐🐐🐐🐐
Chills at the end mate, honestly didn't think you could top Money Game 1 but fuck me you did it. You sir are a true artist, never stop doing what you do.
genius
What the hell did I just watch?  Wowwwww!!!!!
Cool
This is incredible. Congratulations on how you are deciding to lead your career, with tons of talent and innovation as always. This world is better with someone like you. Love and a hug from Spain
So good
Fucking Brilliant.
This is really just a masterpiece!
WHAT… what did I watch for 9 min… how does one even get that good at story telling and his voice is so pleasing to ears.  Absolute masterpiece can’t wait for more songs from you Ren
Yesssss
OMG!
Its incredible to see where you are at now! I've been following your work since the pandemic. Your following grew so much this last year its almost unbelievable 🥰 ❤ I became a fellow sick boi last spring, discovering my brain was hatching a tumor. I hope the treatment you're getting out here in maple's capital really helps you.   Best wishes,  Z.
I only wish good health for you Ren. With it you will be able to do everything you want. And take everyone along with you. Thank you. ❤❤
Literal chills on the last line. Bravo. An excellent continuation.
🐐🐐
You’re a generational talent mate! We’re so lucky to experience your art fam. Thank you for providing it to us 🙏🏻
Algorithm great job
❤❤❤ bravo
Brilliant
Just wow!
Art
A Masterpiece of artisticalliationisms of the ears, eyes, and a mindfulness of thoughtfulness. - On the Money
All I can say is wtf, how? How are you this good at words? Astonishing 🔥
Been waiting, not so patiently, for this to drop. I usually like to make my comment a little more eloquent, but this is all that comes out after watching this video at least ten times. FUCK.!!! I MEAN HOLY FUCK!!! JUST FUCK!!! f u c k....
I'm paralyzed cuz of a drunk driver. I've been in a wheelchair for 24 years and there is no amount of money that could ever make me whole again, emotionally or physically. Money, gold, all the treasures in the world mean nothing when you lose yourself in any way.
Ren scrubs up well for an imaginative thought provoking and stunning piece of art about greed's  injustice  . Love it, but too radical for Wall Street
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Your lad is taking art to another lever. Bruh, this is so beautiful, so poetic!
Absolute Banger Bruv!
Encore! Encore! Encore!!  Truly a Masterpiece!!  Keep it going REN (Modern Truthsayer)
bro never ceases to amaze me and always gives me goose bumps when I watch his wonderfully heavy songs
BRILLIANT!! 👏👏
What a masterpiece to the money game series...
yet another banger that hits so hard.
I don't mean to be a horrible hater. But as much as I love this. This will never top Money Game part 1. Money game was a masterpiece and so was hi Ren. This will never top that either. The graphics are spectacular. Incredible. The opera is fantastic. The video and lyrics are endearing. And like everyone says, it's art. But....I was disappointed. I love the beat and was hoping he'd carry on with the beat. I wasn't a fan of the story behind it. I was hoping he would talk about other things instead of telling a story. I love story telling and messages in music don't get me wrong but - I don't know. I just...I'm disappointed to say the least. Which is a shame because I was SO hyped for this video. I guess I just expected it to be like Money Game part 1. I dunno. It may just be me. But the video is phenomenal. Incredible camera work and captures. I was moreso infatuated by the video than the song and the story behind it. I think that's because Ren wanted to captivate us by the visuals and contrast of the videos. He likes to distract us and share his incredible secrets in his songs. I'm sorry Ren. I loved the video. But I didn't love the song. Don't hate me. :(
I can only say that this is absolutely lovely
broooo so goood
Once again, you have created brilliance for us to ponder. My father shot himself. Let us rise to a more beautiful world.❤
MASSIVE!!!
Ren mate you keep leaving me a little stuck for what to say and a head full of thoughts. Keep doing what you do.
I LITERALLY JUST REWATCHED BOTH MONEY GAME 1 AND 2 AND NOW WE GET THE 3RD ONE???
When’s this coming out on Spotify?
Woah. Fuckin amazing acting mate. And the whole concept of the clip too. Fantastic.
Damn you always know how to deliver a message through song
good god bone chilling  my man 10000000000000/10
C'mon! Is there anything this guy does that ISN'T brilliant?
a gyat song
Thats talented storytelling right here!
OMG! you are freaking insane 💯🔥
Holy shit.. that was incredible. Ren, my guy, you are a musical and cinematic prodigy. Love you and what you do.
Love your music!  For the algorithm
Ren, you're an absolute shining star of the music industry. Just an incredible talent. Bravo on this masterpiece.
Wait - did the 45 year old guy die?
6:54 - 8:36 wow wow wow 👌
Masterpiece again. Well done, sir 😊
Just beautiful. :)
Yezzipe tu me manques putain
Worth the wait, but boi REN the standard just gets higher and higher !!!
I'm waiting to listen to this in the car on my way home from work, i cant wait!!!
Another masterpiece. Hits on all levels.
First full watch with good sound. Just - WOW - money game as a Tale - the choreography - the RAIN RAIN RAIN - the life story of ALL of us told through Jimmy. The cultural nods & winks - the piano - the strings - did I mention the filming.  time for at least 2 rewatches the most REN.
love the piano right from the start! and not even got into the song fully yet!
Great job to the team.
Be the change. Inspiring artistic mind.
Dude. You are a fucking musical genius. Bravo!
Fucking hell man
Wow!
Brilliant!
This music will change peoples lives including mine thank you
Genius 🧠
Amazing song and video. But I also noticed that the video is the same length as Hi Ren, down to the second. If it’s it’s a coincidence cool. If it’s not, I’m excited to know why.
Holy fuck, Ren. This just hit like a bullet, like everything else you do. The video is amazing Samuel and Ren! It's art. This is art.  *This is the world.*
❤
Yeah, just for the algorithm......you have surpassed all expectations. So PROFOUND! Truth
Thanks. 😊
This.
Holy cow Ren . I . Have . No . Words .
Just wow. Nothing to say but freakin WOW.... Awesome Ren. You are going to change the world and shake shit up. I just know it.
A masterpiece in art creativity and the 7 deadly sins - superb Work Ren, Sam and Crew  ❤
As an artist myself, I don't know whether I'm gonna be able to write something as brilliant as this in my lifetime. This piece of art is truly inspiring to me. I feel really thankful that I discovered your music long ago. Big fan!
Been here a long time @Ren since i first found Hold On, and this is what?  7 years later, WOW absolute masterpiece. would usually say i cant wait to see what you come up with in another 7 years but i think i can, and i will. To enjoy everything else you put out  in between here and there for free. what a time to be living!! Thank you for sharing your passion and giving your all. It is very much appreciated. And a huge thank you to your crew for absolutely smashing this art out of the water. Feel for jimmys youth. too many going through that situation. peace!!
Awesome work as always.
Instant chills at 1:50... anyone else? 1:51
Holy Sh*t what just hit us......
If you need me, I’ll be over here picking my jaw up off the floor.
I am stunned once again!  Thank you Ren!
Album is mindblowin...please tour the UK ❤
❤
D A M B ......
Simply pure genius. The truth. Thanks Ren once again ❤️
I watched after an hour and it had 19k views, 3 more hours later and its 119k. Pop off Ren
Yep. I just had my mind blown. Again. Love all your stuff but this is the best thing you've done since Hi Ren and is clearly the direction you want your music to go in. Well, I hope so.
Peaky blinders the musical
Oh man does Ren know how to tell a story. Bravo bravo well done good lad
goosebumps.
Effin awesome!!
YES 😮
It’s here
you bloody geniuses❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
Really good.
Absolute Genius. Cant wait until tomorrow <3
Excellent
This is only the beginning to something far great  Ren thank u with all my heart
this needs to get as much exposure as the rich men north of richmond song it was so well thought out
Pure art, Ren is a genius❤
Dude. Seriously!?!? What did I just watch!?!?! Did Ren compose the music for the strings??  Ren, this is, as Knoxie said, a masterpiece. You are one of kind. No one else has done or is doing what you do.   Thank you, for continuing to share your art with us.
Wow.
Ren, your musical story telling is amazing. That is all. Carry on 😘💕
G’damn. Just feeling shook right now. I never went out to theatre before. I should. This was a performance on a grand scale.
Ren is right, money is just a human invention.    We created it out of thin air as tokens to facilitate trade.  Most people have swallowed myths about money, what it is, where it comes from.  The fact is, money is not lent to you from deposits made by your neighbors, banks create it by bookkeeping entry, by 'fractional reserve banking,' that becomes an 'asset' not a liability to them, to create more money, often 30x, 60x, at the time of the banking crisis some banks had 100x their assets as bookkeeping entry money.  The major source is the 'central bank' who spins it out of nothing and gives very low interest money to member banks as 'debt,' which they use the above to inflate, loan, but now mostly invest.    They loan to the 'best' customers, i.e. rich people, for them and those wealthy to become more wealthy.  Not for the citizens, not for the hoi polloi, not the proles, not for the benefit of the Common Welfare.  No, this is the worst case of 'trickle down' economics.  In fact this is how banks, and private equity, buy up... everything.  Then charge you rent in perpetuity.  These are your new Feudal masters.  But this is not the only way, money can be created by the government treasury, the mint, as debt free economic tokens, and not lent as the economic supply of money that requires interest back as profit on a thing invented by keystroke, but spent by the budget created by democratically elected representatives on the needs of the public, on the 'Common Welfare.'    So we can 'find' the money for infrastructure, research, education, healthcare, housing, childcare, pensions and disability, food security, etc.    No one need be in want when the money doesn't trickle from the top with nary a drop reaching the bottom, but flows across us all, and that money can find its way to banks for the simple practice of savings at 3% and loans at 6%.  Money does not have to be created by a private entity that 'loans' something it created by keystroke to the government or people it resides with, sovereign money, debt free public money has existed before, it can again.  And until we live in some Star Trek universe that doesn't need it, we're going to have to destroy the money myths, democratize our money, and take it back.  Because he who makes the 'gold,' rules. Sovereignty lies in the money power when monetary policy determines fiscal policy, determines domestic policy, determines foreign policy.  There are solutions for debt free money, monetary reform, banking reform, presidents have spoken about this issue before, but without the people, the politicians can not reform things by themselves.    I would love to see someone take this on like Ren does in Money Game, this may be a challenge to do 'monetary policy in a nursery rhyme,' with some nice graphics or cartoon depictions, but we need it.  You can find out more about debt free, public, sovereign money from a number of sources, like Alliance For Just Money, American Monetary Institute, Positive Money to name a few.
Much love, Ren... ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wow...i cant wait for album to get here
45 years old.  45 calibre.  45th president.   Fucking genius.
You could tragically laugh at the fact the humans enslaved themselves by their own invention - money. No way back, sadly. Ty Ren! Your music & art is one of the rare things which still touch my deeply depressive soul. <3
fuckin hell, the boys a legitimate genius! Fuck.
Holy fuck
Ren, I speak for most likely everyone here when I say that, This is a fucking masterpiece .
Damn!
This is just...wow...i'm just speechless. We see the same generic crap daily and then a rare gem emerges. Please don't ever change.
F’n Amazeballzzzzz!!!! Thank you for sharing your AMazzzziNG talents/art💜🪞🐑💸🔫
Post watch comment: I'm honestly speechless. This is a piece of art that will not soon be forgotten.
No doubt the best music video you've made so far, it's so creative and cinematographic ❤  I'm in love with it ❤❤
So Much Truth........
Well done Lads, Fuckin’ Brilliant ❤
A true work of art. I'm not even sure what else to say. Bravo Ren
Chills, I have chills. Once again another outstanding performance ❤❤❤❤❤
WELL, GODDAMN!!! 🕴👏   👏👏   👏👏👏   👏👏👏👏   👏👏👏👏👏  👏👏👏👏👏👏   👏👏👏👏👏👏👏  FUCKING BRAVO!!!
Im 46, a new yorker who grew up in hip hop! This is by far the most impressed and hopeful for the art i have felt. This is multi genre art, not only hip hop but ART❤
Yet another masterpiece how do you do it
Excalibur level excellence young man.... keep climbing... keep giving the world these extradinary other wordly works of art.
My son and I waited patiently for this. Absolutely brilliant. Keep the stories coming Ren.  Two Aussie fans here, and we're spreading your sounds. 👌👏🎶
Ren is the artist the world desperately needs to hear right now. I just hope, with every fibre of my being, that our future adults take his powerful words & performances to heart and begin the journey towards positive change for the future of all hitchhikers on this random rock hurtling through infinite space. (This old hippy is glad to see the hippy spirit still alive and kicking.) ❤
You pored your heart wnd soul into that; thank you for breaking it down on your twitch, that was amazing 👏🏼
WOW Ren, que artista foda tu és!!!
🤘🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️
Silly bro 💙 serious work of art this 🔥🎶 there ain’t an artist that is coming near your talent my man … hope ya feeling better 💙
This kid.... absolutely 100%...THE most talented artist on this planet right now.
Masterpiece . I'm Numb
Anyone else feel like that was not 9:20? When it was over I was shocked. It felt like 2 minutes. That says something.
Gorgeous
i hope with my entire fuckin chest that this song eventually picks up as much traction as dolly parton's 9 to 5 does because the way this decade is going this may be one of the things that deals a serious blow to capitalism. this is STUNNING. thank u for sharing this with the world ren
Captivating and original! Thank you
Ren's lyrics are the strongest i have ever heard from any artist ever. the world woulda been a better place if more people woulda listen to his stuff
Wtf ❤❤❤
Fastest 9 minutes of my life! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️✌️
Worth the wait, THANK YOU
Yes mate; another triumph.
Absolutely stellar!! This man is second to none Nn
I forgot I was watching a music video, this is mind-blowing
A part 3???
Holy S*** Bro, I thought I was about to see you end it.
THE PRODUCTION VALUE SINCE PART 1 WHAT THE FUCK
I've already ordered Sick Boi.  My mailman is getting frustrated as I wait for him.  Not really but I do check the mailbox often.  If I had a wish it would be for you recording & releasing all the songs you have shown on YouTube.  That would be a gift that keeps on giving.  Peace.
It's not a nice story at a time when most of the stories i hear are not very nice. The music is supportive, clever at times, but necessarily, it's not uplifting. I'm exhausted after listening. The only positive response to the issues raised is faith in the face of overwhelming sadness. Sorry Ren, you have great talent and drive, butI need more nice things.
When I first watched Hi Ren my comment was something like, this is greatness, I believe I called it a Magnam Opus on the human condition. And I then said don't keep chasing that level of greatness and try to outdo yourself, as this kind of magic only happens once in a generation... Well now, don't I feel silly! Ren wow and thanks.
Wow Joshie, I'm at a loss for words. ❤
The Money Game is su1c!d3. Ren has said this repeatedly. Will we be brave enough to stop the game?
More brilliance from Ren, although I expected nothing less, the master of truth-telling. Visually excellent also…scrubs up pretty good in a suit 😉😍
This shit is amazing
So good. Love your mind and the people you bring together to do these things. Don't stop... No pressure = ).
AM I DREAMING?
LoveYouRen #TheRenEffect #renegade4life congratulations well done mate and Samual .🏆💰🐷💰🤟🏻💞🐰✌🏼🙏🏼😘xx
So when do we award Ren the Grammy. That was spectacular!
So well done
thought provoking a usual! love it!!!
Omg it’s out
Wow amazing  you never seem to miss with all your music masterpiece like always ren
I knew this would be great. Thanks Ren, another amazingly poignant message.
❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️
Outstanding!
Don't know whether to applaud or cry 😮
Fucking Splendid!
Sam and Ren is such a deadly duo. Their path upwards is only paved by their own intentions and struggles, it's magical.
You were right, this is something special! 👏 amazing work from all involved! 🔥
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
You look proper cute in your suit beg you reach out in a post for the 1 in million that has got severe impact of lymes disease that has to overcome years of isolation misunderstanding
Absolutely flawless,I like quite a few of your songs but this might hold me over for now😏
class
If peaky blinders was a musical 😂
That was an incredibly fast 9 minutes. Wow, just speechless. This will take a bit to digest, but I know right away it's a masterpiece. I know how excited you were and how you challenged yourself to write something on the caliber of Hi Ren, and you absolutely nailed it. This was truly incredible, thank you for giving us this to dig into and listen to over and over again!!
Soooo great this album will be legendary
I never know what to expect with you Ren. Different and interesting!
Just WOW, you said this was special... well thats an understatement if ever i heard one! The video work from Sam is top notch, the storytelling is just mesmerising, the arrangement of the piano and the strings section is poetry to my ears, and the emotion put into the message is REAL. Its criminal if this doesnt win some sort of award, but the subject matter that points out the system means its unlikely to do so, BUT you KNOW that the community you have built up will share this far and wide to as many people as possible!!!
My man really likes to sit in his videos
The message…wow!
That was Sharp!!
Love it!  "‭For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what shall a man give in return for his soul?" ‭Matthew‬ ‭16:26‬  My only wish is that at the end, right after "then he presses on the trigger of a money game," you would have gone into the beautiful "rain, rain, rain" chorus from parts 1 and 2. I think it would have brought it full circle, and would have been very poetic with Jimmy sitting in the wheelchair in the rain...
I’m an old man who’s dealt with my mental health for most of my life.  Being diagnosed with schizophrenia not long ago I relate to Ren.  Real or not I feel he has a great grasp of the struggles I deal with everyday.  Whatever your story Ren, keep making music, to me at least, it makes a difference and I feel.  Thank you.
REN!!!!!  I'm so thankful for your dedication, persistents, struggles thru adversaries, never giving in to all the Dr's who told you they didn't know or maybe its all in your head.  I've found through my life experience, meditation is a witch hunt with the Dr's stirring the pot.  You knew your gifts & what you'd offer the world.  You fought the devil, walked through hell & came to the light.  Yes you continue to battle a war I could never understand.  When you contemplate all that's happened, remember you also won the war for all your fans & those that will continue to come.  Money Game 3 scared the hell out of me.  Lucky I live alone but I'm sure my neighbors heard my "no, no, no". Its a victory musically & video choreography. You videos are plays. But over too soon.  So I watch over and over.  You better not have hurt yourself! I expect  a #4.  I wish all good things for you, medically, happiness, peace, & all good things for family and friends.  Hope this doesn't offend, but I pray for you as you walk through life.😎
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Waiting for luigi version
This is true but just stop and find some self compassion
Pfff no words man
Awesome.  Well done.  Wld love to see Ren and Jordan Peterson interview
😲Im not sure of how you  out do yourself each and every time. This is brilliance. Super genius level! So very well done and put together. Me ->standing ovation!  Peace and love always until there is no more!❤
❤
What an experience, just brilliant
Thomas Crown Affair? 🤔
Speechless. Well worth the wait.
Ren the Money Game trilogy is perhapse one of the most important pieces of art of 21st century to date! In a world where faceless corporations & media moguls shovel shit in our faces 24/7/52 its a joy to choke on these 3 flawless diamonds ❤
Bravo!
I really want to say thank you and give a huge shout out to having real instruments in your music. So much music these days are 100% digital, but having musicians playing on real instruments has a much greater impact on how the music is felt (at least for me). As a cellist, i just want to say thank you for helping keep music alive.
@knoxhill told me to leave a comment.
Jimmy Beast!!!
So freakin brilliant 😍
Being today my 39th birthday, this song came as a sign to appreciate my life, every year passed, even more. Thankfully I was always loved and supported from my family. Ren, you are an amazing storyteller. While watching this video, towards the end I felt my heart start racing like you could really do an extreme final act. I hope that in your art and in your life you feel loved, and you feel the responsability to move on and never give up. We love your music and we love you. Thank you, Alfio.
amazing work as always!
Great work!
Just wow. Well done l!
This is beautiful
Knox calls the a Masterpiece and I would have to agree.  Ren carry on man you have so much to say that is worth all of us hearing.  Lets listen again.
Awesome!!
I’m so glad to be alive in the world of Ren. What a masterpiece!!
Daaammmnnnnn just watched the 1st 2 parts to this and coincidentally was the same day tft the part 3 came out lololol coincidence? I think NOT!
What a Masterpiece Ren! Huge love from Portugal ❤
As a musician myself, my favorite artists are the ones who force me to pay closer attention, the ones who make me feel something. You've done it again.
I don't know where else to leave this comment: I love this, AND I got to listen to the album, and Seven Sins is another favorite of mine.  Thank you for making me feel understood with my experiences and the way my brain works. Thank you for allowing me to feel alongside you and others through your music, and for the joy, solace and feeling of connection that brings me. It's such a gift.
Yet again absolutely killed it. Just when I think Ren can’t get better he constantly raises the bar. The Album is 🔥 thank you for all you do!
Genius
absolutely amazing ren you've done it again!!!
As a graphic/visual designer and somewhat of a musician, I have never ever in my life seen/heard anything even close to this.
This was fucking incredible. 🥲💜
I love how you get to the root of the human condition. This, as well as all of your deep, meaningful stories/productions shows our commonality. It's what we are told from birth either explicit or subliminal that makes us who we are. Some things/beliefs, we can be aware of being unhealthy at an early age and dismiss those, but so much more  hold to act as our creators. For sure, money and the love of money is a huge portion of what forms us. There are so many ways we can learn to use money to help or harm ourselves and humanity. Thank you for this lesson. Thank you, as well, for yet another brilliant production!
That was amazing, I'm speechless!
A-Amazing B-Breathtaking C-Creative D-Dramatic E-Electrifying F-F*cking... G-Genius H-ow I J-ust K-now L-oving, M-ore (and more) N-ew O-riginal, P-owerful, Q-uintessential... REN!  And it all stops here!!!  Except... T-hank you!
Another phenomenally brilliant piece!🙌
Never have I ever seen something so excellent, so unique, and so deep. Another Ren masterpiece. Bravo!
I hope people really hear the words of this masterpiece! Absolutely smashed it again, darlin'!
Epic. 👏👏👏👏👏
Knocking out some powerful shit bro
Wow! Best storyteller in the business. Hands down.
This is more proof of concept for that Netflix show he wants to do!! Amazing as always dude!!
Didn’t expect this today lol
Shout out to that whole crew! Everyone killed it
how the fuck did i get here, ijust wanted to watch a luigi meme 3 years ago. masterpiece.
Ren is the mind of the future 👏👏👏
Worth the wait!!!!
Just Wow
Completely speechless, but genius in every sense of the word. This one's sticking with me til I die.
How can Ren give me chills video after video? Stunning.
this shit go hard
“A zing only happens once in your life.”
This was super heavy and extremely deep great job
Wow breathtaking the message is so powerful the production here is top. Ren u never fail to impress me. Just saw the treasure hunt too left me stunned and in absolute awe of ur amazing mind 💐💐✌️🖤
Profound
love it. well shot. love the ending.
Live for 4 hours and already 100k views. You have amazed me from the first time i heard you.
is it just me or would Ren's music be so perfect for the series, 'Peaky Blinders'.  snap.
WOW!!!!
No way
This was some Martin Scorsese level production and performance!! Not just by Ren but everyone involved in front and behind the camera! Sam you are the shit !!! Fucking Masterpiece!!!
theres a lot of stunning artists running around these days, and they all have their place. this place is sublime, and ugly, and beautiful and i love it
EPIC! 🧐
every single day wating for this was totally worth it and I hope this goes as viral as 'Hi Ren' because this project is absolutely deserving of that. The way all the different parts of this video fit together and the incredible cinematography that connects them is just mindblowing.
This is just beyond fantastic , ren boi uve done it again genius !
Brilliant!
THE best music video i`ve seen is my live. TY Ren, true G.O.A.T.
Omg...you trully never dissapoint, thank you for being so raw, so emocional, so REAL! In this world full of pretend people, of puppets and puppeters, its really refreshing to see someone trully excell at their craft and being so transparent and devoted. Continue what you are doing, at least have the consulation you have changed the way a girl from Portugal looks at life🫶
I thought I had already been red pilled with strawman legal fiction birth certificates etc but that was a feck off suppository. Booted my arse well out of the matrix. Inspired chief. Exceeded all my expectations but then I am not a frigging genius so I have to start thinking deeper. Thanks Ren and the lads. Top banana 😊
WELL........ 😮‍💨 I was praying there would be something just as passionate, meaningful and outright explosively brilliant, like HI REN, you have not disappointed 😃🥹. So much rugged emotion, raw and precise. All TRUTH. I salute you 🫡 . I am so thankful I'm in the time of Ren because you are most definitely an icon. ✊🏽lets get it 🫵🏽😊❤
Holy Shit!  Truth.
Comment
Worth the wait!
Like the first Money Game and like Hi Ren, and like The Tales, this is more than a song, it's a performance.  Bardcore at its best.
Just wow, the rebirth of music right in front of me. Thank you for letting us into your soul, and for transforming the landscape of music forever.
Another amazing piece ren. Youre incredible my friend. Sharing the shit outta this. Thank you for what you are doing. Truly.
I have nothing but love for you ren I only started listening to you this year a few months ago and I'm hooked in big time you are an amazing artist and i will be a fan for life now, I only live 15 min from bton wish I found you sooner, good luck big sucess and deepest best wishes brother you are a treasure keep it up ❤
Ren, you made a song so remarkable and real, again. You said what the world needs to hear. In a way, that I would never be able to describe it. You make art, you make me move, you make me wanna move mountains. Sometimes I listen to your songs and I think to myself 'wow, this man is even getting better, how is that even possible anymore?' I listen to the artist Dax as well and sometimes I wonder what it would be like if you guys made a song together, or would talk with eachother. I am impressed how you 2 describe your view of the world. How you guys talk about fame, succes and money. And when I listened to this song, I got a reminder of a lyric of one of Dax's songs 'I'd rather be happy and broke than rich with no one to love everyday'. You are both amazing artists who have your own signature style and taste of music which I really love. I just wanna end this comment by saying how much I love your music, how strong you are and how much I appreciate the effort you put into your music. You are an incredible person who has been through some challenges in life and made a way through. I'm proud to call you my favourite artist and I'm glad that I started writing songs again just because of your music. You are an inspiration to me and I love you for that❤
I have now watched this 15 times. I keep finding new things. ❤ Thank you Ren
Wow…… just wow 😯
Wow. Just wow…I will be back when I can put my thoughts together. Wow
Wow…… just wow
Love it <3
Amazing ♥️
😮😮
Absolutely beautiful!
You know that game you speak of...It lost.  Love, peas and chip grease.
WOW….just WOW 🔥 @renmakesmusic you are a genius 👏🏼👏🏼🔥💗
Is there a jawdropping emoji? Nope just a picture of Ren.
Ren- Brilliant musician ✔️ Ren- Amazing actor ✔️ Ren- Bomb-ass versatile rapper ✔️ 10000/10 amazing, as always  & hi Ren, if you need a backup violinist lmk  Xo
This should encourage other people, to come out with their individual style and be more confident in uncommon ways to play with woice and vords.
😲
My DAWG! This is raw, emotional, visceral art. I swear, literally every video manages to outdo the one before, and i love it.
Brilliant , Money games have alway been my favorite performances and 3 is no exception. But lets not let the meaning, the suject, the message just go by the wayside. As a species and individuals, we play stupid games we win stupid prizes. As always thankyou REN & Samuel for the truth.
Amazing.
Modern day Bard Sandpiper! Truly a lost art!
I was here
God. Damn.
Loved this and everything leading up to it. Great work from you and everyone else that was involved in bringing it together 😊
Well Jesus fucking Christ, Ren. This is absolutely outstanding!
Ren you’re a genius, you’ve put out truly some of the most refreshing unique and impactful art I’ve ever seen. Can’t wait to see you take the world man, keep it up.
Thank you for another gem REN!
Honestly ren you could do a musical and i am sure alot of peaple would show up who usually wouldnt be interested in that type of stuff. Good unique work like usual 😃
Wow! Just wow!
Worklife interfered with Renlife today, so I couldn't see this or the Game in real time, which about broke my heart. But plunking myself down and watching this on a really good screen and really good speakers... I am in total awe. Mind blown, tears shed, heart racing, dinner forgotten on the plate. What a powerful experience.  Mad admiration for everybody involved in this.  And REN... this is sheer mastery of every art you employ.   Your music transcends music itself.
Real music, by a real musician. Good lord man you put the whole music world on notice. Ren is real, Ren is the new measuring stick.
Amazing.  You never know what to expect.  Always out doing himself. Love it!!
This video should have 1B streams by now!
This is an entire experience, glued to every word and note, like the ballad of jenny and screech.
Magical🎉🎉🎉🎉
Omg!! Just amazing. I have no words! Ren, thank you for your talent and sharing with the word! This was just a freaking masterpiece! ❤
What a masterpiece Ren. Your so incredibly Talented it blows my mind
I can't think of any other artist today or in recent history that consistently turns out impactful deep works of art like you do Ren! I so wish the world was the better place we dream of. I hope your success continues to grow so more and more people will hear what you have to say. It's not enough just to hear though, people also need to listen. The world we've constructed around ourselves is not right. I feel it every day but i can never figure out how to get off of the conveyor belt and step out into something new. I'm so tired of living in this society that values all the wrong things.
People's biggest problem is that they don't listen to true prophets, but only to those who say what they want to hear. You, as a TRUE PROPHET, will have to experience a lot of hurt, but I think the majority are not ripe for radical change and want a comfortable life rather than the truth. Requested Please don't stop what you are doing because it is real art that fills a gap and your insights are very good and apt!!! I love what you do, and even though I'm not English, I definitely want to learn your language so that I can not only admire, but also understand your art. I think everyone who knows you is proud of you!!!
Great job!
Hi Ren was Fuckin sick and got me hooked!
This is bonkers. I look forward to having that physical copy in my hands that I ordered the other day.
I’ve been looking forward to this
Yikes, but in a good way.
Straight fire.
Wish you included the countdown in the video. That was really cool.
❤❤
Just realised, birth and 40 years almost same lines. Because life starts at 40? Wauw!!!
Brilliant! Been waoting for this for a while and it dodmt disappoint 👏👏
Amazing! What a masterpiece. We need that Netflix series now! If this isn’t an advert for how awesome it would be then what is?!   I’m very jealous of anyone getting to visit the set this weekend for the album release party. Drink it in and enjoy every second!
Go Ren boi! Keep breaking rules, bending music and bringing all these people together in a way only you can!   Never has there been just such honest, pure, emotionally honest artistry just pouring out of every track, song, steam, video... and never will another artist capture my heart and brain quite like our Ren.  "Have you found Ren?"
Thank you for spreading the message.  Let us move beyond capitalism.

Absolutely brilliant! Bravo!!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻❤️
every comment is quite useless, an absolute work of art, thank you for sharing your ideas with us ren, you're a source of inspiration!😊❤❤
You've done it yet again. Parts 1, 2 and 3 together is a piece of art. Fantastic. May your continuous rise and and dedication to your art continue for many years to come.
Think this one's going to take a few more watches to dial into that flow. As always, incredibly well thought out, great lyrics and an uncomfortable message, not just for the top dogs either.
Another Master Class.  Thanks Samuel & Ren ❤🎵🪄🎥🪄💣
After I watched this amazing guy, my phone went dead,, had to reboot it,, weird as,  x
Music is art. Poetry is art. We are the canvas for Ren's art. Without us, there would be no Ren. Without Ren, we would not know change.
this will need a few listens i think
B00M!!  ya done it again fella! niiice! peace
😮😮 there's no words.its juste so good!❤
Now, if we could just get more billionaires to turn .45.  🤔 (🫣🙃)
god like
Such awesomeness, What can I say. Thank you for being you.
I loved it ❤
My god the ripples of goosebumps to the overwhelming grief and sadness I felt at the end for humanity was unreal. Another masterpiece ❤ The greatest poet and song author of our time
🙂.
This is a masterpiece 🎼🔥 Fucking brilliant .
So moving as always, Ren! Beautiful work!
Fuck man! Wow. Masterpiece
WOW! Just ...WOW. KILLER IT!! 😁🖤❤️🖤 I HAD NO DOUBTS! BUT SOMEHOW EXCEEDED ALL EXPECTATIONS! 🫦
Ren is the best combination of entertainer and world commentator, making him a tremendous educator. He is acting as the self reflective element of our species, with enough talent to command everyone's attention.  Ren... you are amazing. And priceless. Thank you for sharing yourself with us all.  You are giving us hope for a better future.  ❤
Fucking Awesome
Again a stunned silence after watching. Ren really is a bard a great writer of our time.
FUCKING A, REN!!!!! You never disappoint. But damn, son! You absolutely killed this. Pun intended.
As incredible as always, congrats mate
So good!
Hope for humanity.
Money is a construction, the birth of our destruction,  power for the richest few who lie and steal and hide the truth,  who cannot see cos they are blind, bloated with corruption.  Whilst others starve in poverty,  fight wars and lose their families, the wealthiest majority get fat on all this endless suffering.  When justice cant be meted out, when millions flee in fear and drown, And fires burn in the hearts of men whose children cling to the digital zen, And Armageddon feels normalised when the edited version is televised, And we can’t tell fact from fiction then my friend it’s plain to see,   the end of humanity and sanity. The meek shall inherit the earth.
SWEET ZOMBIE JESUS!!!! Absolutely brilliant!!!! Such weight and such meaning... because it hits so close to home and the truth of how things in the world really is.... WOW just WOW
Yes yes yes!!! You are art Ren! Thank you for yet another piece I’ll have to show everyone i know.
No I mean, you nailed it 🙌🙌
i rarely comment on these and also im a metalhead but this. i have no words. its just amazing. masterpiece. genius..... just godlike.
Amazing production! I'm left feeling empty at the end though. I'm not so sure his "solution" is such a good one to put forward. A real solution isn't quitting, its changing direction and finding a new paradigm. Yeah I guess its appropriate for Jimmy though, so it works.
I lub it.
This young man is a genius. Pure genius. Thank you for speaking your truth, Ren! Keep doing it, please!
I never comment, but EVERYTHING I’ve seen Ren do is nothing less than amazing!  This one is no different!  The storytelling draws me in every time and brings out emotions that few other artists have. Keep it up Ren! So unique!
I belive in US Ren,  love u and love what you're creating.
Another masterpiece, everyone should know the name Ren. You are a genius my dear. Keep up the amazing work! You are such a great story teller, singer, rapper. You got it all. Thank you for everything you do.
Thanks Ren!
Just,,, memorising,, and the words,, true,, your acting is amazing,  so true,, you hav so much in your mind to   get out,, keep giving and the people will take and devour,  learning from you,, a great observer of the world,, x
Best movie trailer I've seen in a long while.
Just when I am blown away by the last video, the latest one results in mouth wide open, eyes wide open, and wow. Everything works in a one take for a complete breath take away.
WOW MAN this guy is awesome, awesome ,awesome
Just can’t seem to miss. Phenomenal all around. Everything you do is a gift that keeps giving!
I've never been able to pick a favourite Ren piece of art until now . This is pure perfection Ren and Sam. Well done Sir xx
Yesssss
Chills, my man
Ren I love your music. Think I need to listen to this 1 a few more times
This. Is. Art.
masterfully done sir ‼️
Incredible.
That was so incredibly heavy but so god damn real well ren
Straight to the playlist!
Love your storytelling....it's pure art 🎭  More please, you are the Street Shakespeare of this generation
Just wow Ren.
goosebumps... wow
this is fckin' great!!!
.
Unreal, just fucking unreal truly at a loss for words when trying to describe the creative genius behind Ren. Never change mate, your storytelling ability is almost unrivalled I feel lucky to have the opportunity to see what you produce
Amazing ❤
Absolutely phenomenal. Unfortunately, I was still entertained, but I find my entertainment inside knowledge, mate. Love ya, Ren.
Pulls you in from the very first moment, takes you along with the  brilliantly woven lyrics and the visuals which unfold like a theatrical (not so) short  and leaves you  ...well that is it, it won't, i think this has  statement size,...it will be people referring to that form of people running after capitalism, as the  Jimmy from Ren's Song ( not so cool cuz my love's name is Jimmy, but we can differentiate, right, lol) , or a reference to   pray to "false" gods or parents wrong advice only to be ruining themselves instead of learning to think for themselves, what would be fulfilling ones soul and not leave you alone.... Well, i am not as good with words as you Ren, but congratulations to this masterpiece, i hope it will not only earn  well reviews but also sell the album, i wish you so well, you are a person who i admire for your strength, please keep reminding yourself, when things get tough (they always  might but it gets better again), that you can do it, out of any hole, please stay as awesome and awake as you are you are needed as an artist and a person in this world. I enjoy to  share the views you allow us to share, and listen to your stories, in the best sense of the words "Sick Boi"!!!!
Great fricken job to all of those involved.

Incredible how relevant this is.  If anyone is reading this a while from now, this music video was out 5 days after Gaza invaded Israel and committed an organised mass terror attack. I don't know if it was intentional, but... Yeah. Wishing peace and kindness to everyone  And what a music video Ren, you're nailing it every single time!
f´n brilliant Masterpiece
Yet another masterpiece from a master craftsman in the MUSIC GAME 🔥🔥🔥
Wow, that’s not just a music video for a song, that is theatre, cinema, poetry,  classical music.  Ren and Sam created a kind of art that works on its whole, I mean you can of course play the song separately, but it isn’t the same, at least for me. As for other videos,  like Hi Ren, the visual part, the settings, the acting, the light(!!!) are as important as the music itself.
Amazing 🫡 👑 🙏
Quit making me cry! Shut up! I love you! Keep being you!
❤
🎉🎉
YES REN!
Holy fuck what a great song! I'm not too keen on the most "rap" songs Ren's released as of late, but this one is amazing. Also, the cinematography for this video is unreal
You are a musical god!
Just love it that you always go so deep into different kind minds!
Jimmy, just another victim of this old money game
Powerful, thought provoking, and wildly artistic.
Is the audio off the video ?
(Money Game part 3) a cinematic masterpiece
Please, please, tell me that gun is fake, I imagine it is but the bullets were pretty convincing and the click of loading the mag, pretty convincing but please tell me he did not point a loaded gun right at Sam with his finger on the trigger, I know Ren's smarter then that but I just need the confirmation XD And himself, ok I really feel it's fake now lol or at least dummy rounds
This was amazing. Didn't expect it to top Part 2, but it did
Wtf, amazing. No other words needing. So talented ❤️
Great as always
All things you are making are a big art and a lot of it's with a message.... i love it ❤
I hope many many many people see this and going to reflect their own lives.
This is crazy good. Ren... never stop.
The truth and its sad . You keep it so real Ren ❤
kid really sold seashells on the seashore
Wow Ren did it again, thanke wee man.
What on earth did I just watch 🔥
Bravo Ren, a second masterpiece after hi ren. Keep it up bud, more of this plz.
I'm getting major Quentin Tarantino vibes . he's the Quinton of music videos. we need a TV series from Ren. you know he's got that in the chamber
You are damn right to be proud! Still processing but curious about the impact on me, on us. I'm in for  change and working on it from a smaller scale and still making an impact.... 😘
Absolutely amazing
Wow wow wow!!!! ❤
Sam and Ren. Speaking my inner thoughts. Thank you. Now, how do we escape the petri dish, or are we stuck watching human nature play out?
Once again Ren strikes it out of the ball park. Great song, great lyrics. So painfully true the ladder of life we climb.😑
Never thought it could get better, I was wrong...
Listen AND learn
Wow Ren, you are certainly changing the world 🌎 ❤️ Thank you for all ur work and dedication 👏  💐  We need u right now brother
Burn them with your lyrics 🔥🖤
I have been at work. I cannot watch this now. I saw the first minute and it’s already brilliant. Cannot wait to clock out and immediately watch the rest of this.
Awesome
Nothing but facts
Thanks so much there is only two singers that makes a difference of all others singers.. One it’s Ren and the other one is Asaf Avidan… They are not your typical average singer .. The experience I feel when I listen to their master piece songs is exquisite it’s refreshing and a unique experience..Thanks for being humble and Asaf as well..❤
Fuck my guy that made me feel bad about ordering the large mixed kebab to celebrate the release of this video. I'll just get regular next time.
Ren, you are not only a musician or a poet, you are a master, keep doing what you do <3
🔥
Your art is a wake up call I hope that people will hear. It just doesn't get any better than what you are doing and creating.
The word “artist” is bandied about far too liberally in the music industry. Anybody who can use auto tune to sing some mediocre nonsense they didn’t even write themselves is called one. But with Ren and his team, the word even seems like an understatement.
WOAH! Your storytelling and visuals become more impressive with every new video!  Please never stop innovating that Bardcore music Ren!!  🎵   Also, again your way of storytelling is unmatched bro!!
❤
Stunning,real art only word for this❤
Comment for the algorithm as this needs to be seen
Gobsmacked. Wow.
BROO!!!
From animal to this, damn. I dont think people telize how hard it is to play a string instrument well and a percussion instrument as well
Bro. You're awesome, it's rough though. now with what's happening... fuck..
Legend! 🤙🏻
I can’t even speak. This is a piece of art that will be looked on for ages.  Way after we are gone.
Great !!!
Ren’s mind consistently blows me away, the power he has to bring so many emotions out whilst raising awareness, comforting people, bringing people together 🖤 from the early days to right now 🖤 I feel so proud 🥹 Rens music/talent will live on for generations to come 🙌🏼
Wow!  Kind of left speechless and also in tears.  It's so sad that this is what so much of the world has come to.  This was a Masterpiece Ren!
Yessss
Just amazing. Art. No other word for it Just Art.
This is a masterpiece just like every single video you make!
You da man!
How can you make a song with lyrics so out of this world and have the audacity to make a video that insane!!! Ren is not human, but God.
Wow just wow x
Incredible piece of art! I wrote a song about an evil investor last year, fits into the money game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghiAXOJDX4E
Wow
This is the kind of art our world needs. So so badly. Chilling, haunting, perfect.
Well done.
Sitting here depressed and speechless af in the middle of the night. Thank you Ren, you are too precious for this world.
YOU HAVE GOT TO READ THE NYMPHETAMINE GIRLS! CHRIST! YOU JUST NEARLY DESCRIBED THE WHOLE BOOK. HOW PRIVELAGE DESTROYS AND BREEDS LUST FOR MONEY AND FAME. - ANNA J WALNER
I'm at a total loss for words, Ren this is PHENOMENAL!!! And totally worth the wait. I am so happy for you, I hope this day is everything you hoped it would be. You must be absolutely glowing with pride right now! Enjoy!!
So Luigi wasn't teaching how to take over the world, he was warning himself
You never cease to amaze!!
Wow
Bloody unreal from start to finish, Ren you are a musical genius and a master of life. Love you man ❤❤
You are insane man! You've turned what used to be some simple tunes into the most deep art form!
Jesus Christ mate! What a story.
Ren Ren Ren, damn. Such an amazing job from everyone! This is so beautiful on every levels
I watched this in pure darkness, so the sudden flash to black gave me actual chills
What more can you say about this fkin guy man, on a different planet to anything out there, genius at work
This is such a great song
Wow😔
LET'S GOOOOOO DUDE
Oh Ren what have you done ! my poor brain is going to need a bit of time to process this masterpiece 😂, i love it all from the cinematography to the orchestra and your storytelling was first class 👏 Sam is fab as usual and the rest of your team deserve tons of credit. ❤
amazing nothing more to say  per-ordered Sick Boi  from  Itunes   a while ago  cant wait
B R A V O !!!! 💖💖
Easily the best music video I have ever seen!
that's pretty algorythmic
Damn....I'm gonna have to dwell on this one...I'm just kinda floating here in my head now.
Wow!
Goat❤
Ren, could you stop raising the bar so damn high in the atmosphere that no one else can come close? You aren't redefining the game, you're wrecking it and creating a whole new one. Love all that you do brother.
sheesh. ima need some time
Stunning piece of art. I'm out of words, hell, out of breath at the moment. Music makes difference, art makes difference and that difference they are trying to weed out in a money game. You are beautiful soul Ren. Please keep doing what you do best, telling stories, make people feel.
wooooow woooow beast
He's levels above everyone rn, just glad I'm here to witness, love and gratitude bro 💚
You are an incredible storyteller
THE ENDING
Is there nothing Ren cant do? This is freaking insane!
This was amazing!
Brilliance and some hard truth!
Incredible
What a masterpiece! ❤
Wow...just wow! No other words work.
Oh wow, this video is insane. The storytelling, the visuals, everything... Ren, you're one crazy genius, that's for sure.
This story is a piece of art that like always touches till the deepest soul. Is this a true story of an existing person? Or for example a metaphore?
Amazing, will be rewatching and listening to this.  Love the amazing story telling and work that goes into every lyric.
I actually gasped at the end, loved it!!
Wow, Ren, your are a genius artist with a hot heart, a real treasure for so many. Thank you, this is just great, unique and everything at once. Voice... ☀🌧🌈
A masterpiece is right! Ren is in his own league …. Blown away, I’ll be thinking about this for weeks ….I already want to watch again, along with the previous parts. Release day can’t come soon enough❤
I love how the flow is like his King Dotta diss. The jazz vocals whilst looking in the mirror with the piano is reminiscent of for Joe intro and also to some extent violets tale intro. Everything he does connects somehow to what he has done previously. There are all these connecting threads through his body of work - conceptual continuity. Nice touch that the thumbnail for the video is very much like Hi Ren and both Hi Ren and Money Game Part 3 have exactly the same run time.
This is art, that's all. Art in its purest cosmic and stellar form, u are an exploding sun, bro
Masterpiece
I find ren cringe
🤔......Ren as the next James Bond? Just planting seeds.
There are no words to describe how brilliant, thoughtful, and talented you are
Mindblowing stuff from start to finish. Have never seen something so well executed on YouTube before. The whole premiere experience was out of this world. Even the countdown unbelievably well thought through. Congrats all
Another Masterpiece ! Your Videos are brilliant.
amazing
In their lust for money and power they sacrificed you to Moloch.   I tried my best to stop them.  R.I.P Earth
Ren is a god damn genius. And the videography is a masterpiece.
Wow! No words adequate for this!
Nonstop crazy good
I CANNOT wait for this album tomorrow!  When will Money Game 3 be on Facebook? I need this in my Story!
Just. Wow.
This isn't music anymore... This is art in it's purest form💲🥺 it is a masterpiece
this is amazing
Great performance as always, don't quite get it, I'll watch Knox Hill's reaction to understand it better. Look forward to getting my copy of Sick Boi.
very impressive, creative art you just never know what you gonna get with REN. as always a very profound message to the world
This is 1 of the greatest songs of all time, chills all over my body
Very good
Speechless! This is a masterpiece. Well done Ren
Too early for the lyrics guy 😭
Wow
Wow! I‘m totally blown away! The piano, the strings, the camera work and most importantly the story. Ren, you did it again! You fucking blew my mind!
Bitten by a tick boi!!!
The master storyteller is back. Brilliant!
I always like first cuz I know it's going to be a banger. Never disappointed ever since I first heard your Money Game 1. Glad to see you making more and more :)
Well, that's me awestruck yet again!
It just keeps getting better and better! No limits to this man's brilliance! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🤔..🤨..😯..😧..😬..😳..🤯….👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼  MASTERPIECE by REN & SAM!!!
Bro should write and star in his own musical on broadway with this shit
Every single time you blow me away you are amazing! I love the way you perceive life and how you give perspective to others! I love how you can physically reach down in my soul and pull out my feelings and put them into words! Literally every time you sing a song it's like listening to a story told by an old wise man! Thank you so much for making music Ren!! Love you bro!
damn. i keep finding myself surprised that i'm at a loss for words whenever i hear a new Ren piece. what masterful artistry his song writing and rhymes are. incredible.
❤ Love the piano too
Wish you adequate reach, dude... 👍
Brooo I gotta run this back, bruh made 9 mins feel like 3...🔥 🔥
I think Justin Hawkins said in your interview on 'Hi Ren' how do you top that?...but I think you just have.
Worth the wait 🔥.
Absolutely Amazing. The best song yet in my opinion.
Holy chit what a masterpiece. I have never seen anybody like this man. He is a magician with words and emotions. Real Deal
Wow 😮
What a masterpiece. Thank you Ren, Samuel and all at Square Sun Studios and Secret Garden 👏 👏
I’m loving this.
What a perfect masterpiece never fails to amaze me ren truly one of a kind keep it up!
DAMN
Damn this is a masterpiece!! what a crazy piano track, lyrics,  and visuals!
That was  extremely powerful
Wellp, you did it again Ren, another masterpiece! The videos are amazing every time and your words always sink in. Thank you for all the work you put into your craft
As always, another masterpiece. Amazing storytelling and visuals, you truly are a true artist!!
YES!
Lived up to the hype and then some. Punk rock. ❤
Literal chills throughout
Well, I was already very sad finding out my sons best friend died, this makes me even more sad. THIS world is not my home
It's as if these Money Game songs are the groundwork for a Broadway musical. Do it!
absolutely incredible
HOLY!! That was incredible!  Thankyou Ren 🙏 Thankyou for shining light into the corruption of this world. Bless You 🙌 Love this ❤👏
I love it❤
You’re a genius Ren!
Speechless 😮
Just been catching up on your twitch. All of this was so well constructed, orchestrated and enacted. So beautiful and amazing. I've never seen anything like this before in my life. You way exceeded Hi Ren for me by a factor of about a thousand... and Hi Ren changed my life.  Even if all I can do is spread the message and grow this community among my friends I'm so happy to be part of it. Thank you. ❤
Loved this, Ren.  Really makes you reevaluate your life and goals. ❤
Bloody killler performance 🎭🙏❤️‍🔥
Is there significance to the gun not firing at the end? Just a click
This is heat fam.... Damn... Sheeesh 💪🏿 💪🏿
This one gives me the same chills as when I first found "Hi Ren"... Awesome arrangement, love the words and video too. It's been such a treat finding you Ren, I hope you are still getting 100% healthy!
Just, wow.
Best video ever
This is honestly unreal
If Rens music was home runs in baseball ⚾️ he’d have broken a record…out of the park every time. This was worth the wait….it’s a F(beeeep)King masterpiece
Magnificent
Cinematography, subtle details like Ren's hands shaking at the start, all very beautiful. Great job Ren!
You are a Real Artist Bro.
Bravo maestro ❤🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿✌️👍👊
This is the most captivating video I have ever seen.  I am stunned.
Great idea, awsome music, superb direction, perfect camera, big message and amazing performing! Amazing Ren!❤ I wonder where it was filmed, cause the floor looks like a cattle/pig barn or even more like a slaughterhouse where the animals are crowded before they're slaughtered.
incredible, back to the roots ✊
Ren's done it again
The verbal, audio, and videography was off... the f... charts.  Off of them. Amazing work Ren.
Brilliant
Well .................. yet again ............ no more needs to be said ! .
Wow!!! 🔥 Simply amazing
❤❤
❤
Well I just lost myself for 9 minutes. This is utterly, utterly stunning, a perfect conclusion to the trilogy. Another home run.
What a modern day bard you are. Brilliant!!
Amazing as always! Keep up the great art, Ren!
Holy **** 😮😮 my heart felt this one 💔
He deserves a number 1 album!! Never have i seen another artist put as much effort into there work than Ren ❤
You are one of a kind Ren. I have no words, this is Art.
❤
❤
Beautiful. I am mostly a listener of punk and metal but Ren just fits in somehow, probably because it’s art and it’s phenomenal.
omfg
Ren, brother, thank you for articulating so wonderfully the things that the world needs to hear.  You and others have said it before in different ways, but with art like this the message can hopefully shoot deeper into the veins of our common culture.
More Luigi????
REN whats going on in your head bro, this is amazing!
❤
❤
❤
I never comment, but I feel a responsibility to do everything I can to boost this masterpiece in the algorithm. Impeccable work as always Ren.
❤
bangin tunes truly a masterpeice
Holy shit. you sir are an artist. so powerful. thank you!
❤
OMG, Ren. I just finished watching and I AM speachless... Feel like crying, of both sadness and also of aww for the art in this. As you say in a song, I think somewhere in Losing it, I really have come to believe that you are "an angel in disguise" that has descend to this disturbed world we live in to help in our AWAKENING ❤
❤
That one hurts it's so true.
❤
Complete and utter genius. That’s it, there’s nothing else to say.
Incredible- I think I need time to let these lyrics sink in after their initial impact.
❤
❤
Great song You got another part for to do though The tale of Jenny and screech pt.4 The story of Stevie When he meets chinchilla
Sounds mad, but Rens opening sounds EXACTLY like Billie Holliday.
Amazing 🤩
One of his best works so far
I keep rewatching it. Disability/chronic illness is the ultimate clash with capitalism, isn't it?  If people were valued independent of disability, chronic illness, their value to the job market etc., our world would look different.  And health isn't guaranteed. It's an unalterable trait that causes people to experience systemic discrimination, and it can affect everyone.  Any value system that doesn't take that into account will fail people and ultimately cause suffering.
Oh my, that‘s gorgeous.  Thank you so much for your art and that you let us be part of your thoughts and your view on the world!
You can tell when someone hasn’t really handled a gun when they put their finger on the trigger right away. I know that isn’t the point of the video however. Great video, so talented
Amazing!
Ren has done it again. What an absolute masterpiece!
The Camera work is- wow
Worth the wait, absolute masterpiece Ren 🎉
Extraordinary lyricist. Mind blown.
What the fuck just happened????
🫡
I am speachless! Thought i would be listening to a song meanwhile this was a whole experience.
So excited about this I can't even put it into words. Let's go man!!!
Ren. You are a gift from God and chosen for such a time as this ! Praying & Slaying for you Ren !
"Such a shame"
I wasn't prepared for this...😳😢
..and then along came Ren. We need you now more than ever!
Fucking 🔥!! This man is genius when it comes to story telling! This shit had me right there, im talking fully immersed! Your BRILLIANT, my dude. Absolutely brilliant! Give this man what he deserves, a fucking standing ovation!!
wow
Holy shit fuck this is something else
We need to start talking about Samuel. Seriously.
Wow! Just wow! Thank you Ren for wonderful creativity
I was just completely sucked in, everything was just so well done. I'm wiping the tears from my eyes. Ren, Samuel and everyone involved, well done this is just beautiful.
❤
i like!
🔥
Performance art. No one is doing this kind of work.  The consistency of vision and execution is astounding.
Brilliant
Your genius has no boundaries.
I have no words. Sorry.
The cinematography, choreography, art & production value is off the charts. The entire team has shot light years beyond what you've done heretofore. I can see many awards and accolades in thy immediate future.
That was INTENSE!!!! And a fitting Part 3 indeed 👏 👏👏
Absolutely worth the wait!
Absolutely artwork!!
So good so good so good xoxoxoxoxo
You re just a genius. Totally atypical kind of music. Piece of art really.
Wow❤❤
I pre-ordered your album! I haven't bought one in a very long time! lol I just love what you do and the music/art you create!! 🖤🩶🖤🩶
Wow, just wow. Another masterpiece. Excellent job mate!
This is fucking ART! 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌 Perhaps one of the most important songs of our time! It's definitely up there, telling stories of TRUTH! Amazing song writing/story telling... THIS IS ART, this is LIFE! ❤
Legend. Predict 007 in your future. 😂
As a life choice I have not earned nor spent a single dollar in over 3 years now, the struggle is real but,  my conscience is never been more clear 🎉
Fuckin wow. What a treat. Thanks Ren.
Wow just wow
WOT 😳😳😳😳 ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Damn!
Rens a modern Shakespeare and this believe it or not is how u ment hear Shakespeare
Ren, you don't just give us music. You don't just give us songs. You give us your soul. You come as you are. You don't pretend to be more than you are. A lot of people pretend to be kings and queens, gods and demons. But you come to us as a man, a human being. I love you Ren, keep it going. Say what people are afraid to say. Do what people are afraid to do. And as always, keep being you, because no one else could ever be you.
Started listening to you because of the meme that came from your Money Game Part 2, every new song is so impressive and it's the best accident in my life.
Congrats!
So, first you made me realize i am a hypocrite, then you educated me on how the world operates and now you tell me the story of drive, influence and greed. Well played Ren! loved it! Great job Sam.
Once again Ren raises the bar. This hit me hard and i'll explain why. In the beginning when he described the childs first 14yrs he could of been describing my  youngest son, except for the fact i raised my children to think for themselves,to never be afraid to ask questions or stand up for themselves, to respect fellow humans but also to demand that respect in return. We were always short of money but he earnt his way into Grammar school.  He was always top of his class,polite,but....When he began questioning the teachers,searching for deeper answers that was when the phone calls began, the parent teacher meetings and why? because he wasnt afraid to stick his hand up,to question and challenge the teachers and when they tried to shut him down he stood his ground. Now im not the the type of person who thinks they're child can do no wrong ,but in these meetings i listened to their arguments and always the root of their arguments came back to him being outspoken and challenging teachers when he thought something was wrong,and might i add here that during those meetings it always turned out they had to admit he was right but that he shouldnt have challenged the teacher in front of the class. Never once in those many  many meetings when i asked if he'd been rude or disrespectful did they say he was,the one and only reason was because he used his voice ,and knowing my son at that age he could have debated with the best of them.  He was more intelligent at 11yrs old than many of his tutors and he was articulate in his reasoning with them and this didnt go down well.  Yes he could have backed down ,yes he could have let them talk down to him and yes he could have become part of the flock,perhaps many people believe that is what i should have made him do but no i stood by him and at 14yrs they expelled him. He never went back to school. Had no qualifications. Yet at 17 he got into a university on his own merit, he passed with honours and now writes software for the government amongst many. He has a family ,works hard for very little money . But more importantly he is honest, kind,respectful and incredibly aware of the corruption among society and thankfully is teaching his children to never be afraid,to stand tall and believe in themselves.  My point is ,the education system is as corrupt as the goverment and any child that does not conform to their standards or dares to question is in want of a better word quashed. The next generation is doomed if it continues in the direction its heading. Parents need to become accountable for the future adult they are raising. What has happened to commonsense? Just because we are told to do something doesnt mean we  should blindly obey. Thanks to the internet we have a wealth of information at our fingertips but also a world of misinformation.  Be it on YouTube,Google, social media or bloody tik tok is more important than ever we question everything and search for the truth and teach our children to do the same. Some days i feel like i failed my son and if id brought him up differently and silenced his voice he could of achieved so much more. But then i look at the man he has become and the father he has become and i wouldnt change a damn thing. Money isn't everything, integrity and respect for our fellow humans is.
Magnificent
Another masterpiece from a man that speaks for an entire generation
Gosh, Ren, I just started watching your Twitch stream.  It can be so painful to see a truth that the powers to be aren't ready to acknowledge and act upon, and that many can't, or don't want to see.  Thank you for sharing that truth, and that pain. I hope that whenever that pain gets too overwhelming, you'll  have someone to give you a good hug.  In case you want and need it, here's a virtual hug (oops typo, almost sent you a virtual hog 😬🐷).
You never do a bad song just love it :)
Holy shit Ren. This is a freaking masterpiece. Excuse me while I pick my jaw up off the floor. 🔥🔥🔥
The quality of women decide the quality of gentlemen.
That is amazing ren, I love the rollercoaster ride you took me on. The ending made my insides flip over, I can't praise it high enough. Your very talented ren xxx
Well @#%£ me sideways.  🎤drop. 🥰
I love how you carry the same theme through all of the parts, but for this one, you switch up the beat from the last 2, creating a new story, a personalized one like that of Violet's, Jenny's, and Screech's. Excellent job again, Ren.
You’ve done it again Ren! This is a masterpiece, I now have to go listen to the songs in order. It was so worth the wait!
Amazing 🤩
"The words of his father "He's such a damn shame" got me. My father is narcissistic and always said that. I had to cut him out of my life forever. Damn, i hope it's not personal for you too..
Love it. Excellent 👌
Dude!!!!again I'm left bedazzled by ur beauty ❤❤❤ llongyfarchiadau 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
❤Perfection just happened. Marvellous piece of master art.
Gives me chills!
Those are some Jeff Buckley pipes . #masterpiece
This has to be the one to top Hi Ren.  Pt. 1 The Problem Pt. 2 The Theory Pt. 3 The Usa Case/Result
I'm pretty sure I stopped breathing somewhere in the middle of this masterpiece. And then when the gun came out, I just got chills all over my body.
This is not even a song, or a speech, not even a rap. It felt like food to my soul, something I would gladly eat daily and share with the rest of the world. It sums up life in ways I have never heard before. Thank you, Ren, I  have never listened to anything soul-satisfying in a long time.
holy fuck shit I am absolutely speechless I don't know what to say I was mesmerised the entire time it felt like it went on forever but it also felt like it was so short this is truly your masterpiece you've come so far and it's incredible with what you've accomplished
Tu es un géni!
ily man great work as always
21k views and 18k likes in 1 hour. That says it all really. Take a bow Ren. What a masterpiece
Incredible ......
Wow ❤️
Wow. Just wow ❤
Holy fucking hell.... this is unbelievable, no words to describe it, Ren you are a true genius
It takes skill ,talent and a fucking genius to make the viewers feel like they're actually in the same room ...engrossed from the first few seconds, was listening on my headphones, the bullet that flew past frightened the fuck out of me.....which I'm assuming was the whole idea ...wonderful quirky amazing brain ren ...❤❤❤
Ren is a genius!
Another masterpiece! Thank you. I always waiting for your next video so hard. And it's even better than I expected. Every time.
Holy shit, thats so true that it hurts. Thank you for the honesty in youre songs!
Woahhhhhhhhh
I don't have words... that's so good! Love and respect 🔥💪
Amazing as always
Powerful.  Words to the wise.
Amazing! A work of art, as always! ❤
🎉🎉🎉🎉
holy shit this is incredible.
F*ucking BRILLIANT!
F***!!!! Do you EVER miss?
A story about Hunter 😂
It's fucking insane how good this is, I can't even fathom it. Well worth the wait, and well worth all the praise it receives!!
Awesome!
True artist 🔥🔥🔥
Wow that was incredible
Firstly Bravo 👏👏👏 absolute masterpiece. The piano and strings were…. Oh I can’t even express it… just mwahhh.  After a couple listens something struck me, the first part you sing reminds me of Violets Tale, and we know how that turned out. The removal of the head sack could almost represent birth, are our lives already mapped out by what we are born in to and what we are taught in the world we grow up in? It is only having the ability and willingness to look at things from every perspective that will make us truly see and make our own opinions. You have opened my eyes, brain and heart with your music and humanity, thank you so much 🫶
Why are blind people so good at playin the piano ?
I knew you'd make brother...
Ren. Your music is incredible! Pure genius to the highest level! Thank you!!
🤍💛🧡💗💚💙💜🤎🖤✌
Wow
Ooh REN, this is as disturbing as I can cope with. Undoubtedly brilliant, you always are, but sometimes the truth is too big a pill to swallow and too hard a lesson to take, to hear, to learn. Your most unsettling work to date. I don’t know whether to thank you, or cry. With love from Annie, in Cornwall.🌸💖😶
speechless.
Wow! To do this in 1 take - faultless! I need to sit, & take it all in before I can watch it again. Amazing work ❤️
Wow! Absolutely speechless. Ren, I wonder how you manage to surprise even further after all these songs. Your art is an immaculate description of what heights music and storytelling can reach only if one uses their creativity.
Absolutely brilliantly performed, written, filmed and created. Well done to all those involved, looks like an epic undertaking. Just fucking WOW 🤩
This is a true artist. He's not just musically talented but also visually expressive to the point you feel apart of the story. Most artists can't draw people in like Ren can. He's truly one of a kind ❤
♥︎
The voice of the invisible Generation who doesn't play the game but pays the price.
Ren’s ability to push boundaries musically, performatively, lyrically, artistically and creatively is a lesson, not just in music but in life. These seemingly endless masterpieces are no coincidence. It’s the compounding effect over years of allowing himself to be free to experiment, embracing the uncomfortable, articulating his own vulnerabilities, and then expressing them so profoundly in the form of music without fear of judgement. If we all adopted this approach in any of our crafts who knows what is locked away within us that hasn’t been discovered yet… we’d be better humans for sure. There is no one alive doing it as good as Ren is right now
Incredible
Ren. Thank You!
Absolutely perfect
Looking forward to part 4
I truly don’t have words to describe that. Congratulations to everyone that worked on this song and video🙏🏽
Masterpiece ❤
Ren art strikes again 💯👌💯
The thing about Ren tracks is you need to buckle up, you know things are about to be taken to a whole different plain of existence....you can prepare yourself but you are never truly ready for how deep the black hole goes....
Sick story you made here again man! It starts with the age of 1 and the word mine which is way too common and accepted in todays world sadly.
did you really solve the rubic cube ,your just too good at every thing, dont stop creating
what a story teller. this was epic.
Is there a better lyricist? Seriously? I do not say that lightly by the way. I mean amongst all his other talents which are an absolute given, I can’t get over his writing in regards to lyrics over anything else.
Wow ren love the symbolism amazing lyrics are so powerful.
Ren, outstanding, this is amazing! There are so many words and messages in this art piece, it is almost besides the point to praise you, Sam, your whole crew. Now, what if he had a revolver at the end, spinning the drum to play Russian roulette before pulling the trigger of the money game? That way he keeps playing but with a mathematical certainty he loses at one iteration of the game. But you know already that everybody is a critic, more porridge, good sire, por favor...
Brah
Salvation is desire, what your salvation, no doubt, you more a man than your father, what you do with that, you sing.
❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤
Take a good care of yourself, Ren!  Or else, merry me so that I can take care of you. 😅 Love and appreciate you very very much! Thank you for your art and everything you are.  Sending hugs your way. 🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡
Humans are maggots devouring a corpse!
This man is a gift to us all.
Wow! Im speechless! What a kind of art.
I thought that the day has come, where we no longer can expect to see, hear or feel any "real artists"...  and then BOOOM... THIS LITTLE FUCK teaches me a lesson on so many layers.  The lesson to NEVER GIVE UP TO HOPE.  NEVER GIVE UP TO EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED. TO NEVER GIVE UP TO BELIEVE.  Thank you so much, Ren. Thank you!
Fuck me, so so beautiful.
I wasn't expecting this! We'll see if it can live up to the previous two.
This is so sick! Makes me want to start playing the piano again. Ren, thank you, thank you! Also that suit is 🔥
Amazing!
Speechless 🤯  First of all, Sam has outdone himself. That opening shot was spectacular and the whole video, pure artistry.  Second of all, Ren's performance had me on the edge of my seat. Such a dark and interesting concept brought to wonderful fruition in true art 👏👏
You are a fuckin genius.
This is pure genius. I just hope this generation and the next ones after will learn the lesson of past and actual mistakes.
Holy 🤬, once I saw the bullets I couldn't hear a thing Ren said. My brain just froze.
Merci Ren, d’être un artiste merveilleux premièrement, et merci également à toutes les équipes, et personnes qui t’accompagne dans ta créativité fantastique ! Félicitations, c’était un live réussi qui nous en as mis pleins les yeux !
This is art. And it’s what we need in this day and age. If only people listened ❤
Absolutely wonderful performance, song, and video.
🤫... and then they all woke up. . . 🤯 "Fuck the Game, at every level!" 🔥$ 48 years here!
Yes.
its the tale of jimmy. god damn dude.
I love this
Love it. Will done my man..!
Dont do it Ren! Put ur music into a movie...direct something mindbending... you have creative skills 💯
This is just so fresh and different. Keep telling the tales is such a generationally defining perspective brother. Not the hero we asked for but the one the industry needed.
Thanks bro!
this is the best fcukin new music style to come out since r'n'r mixed the blues, country and boogie boogie.....fcukn the best!!! i love it all Ren
Why is this piece of art getting better and better every time I watch it??? I always say you’ll never get that same feeling that you get from the first time you see Hi Ren. Now this video feels like a contrast in that I’m getting more of a buzz of excitement inside me and greater inspiration from experiencing it multiple times. Smashed it as always Ren! I’ll just call it what it is… the best music video of the year by a country mile 👊
Thank you, Ren that you always bring us down to earth. 🙏
I would love to see you do a collaboration with Jacob Collier. Have you reached out, by any chance? That would be truly 7th Heaven ❤
Phenomenal and so worth the wait... 💜
Incredible mate, you’re a true artist.
Only artist capable of giving me goosebumps....
Watching it again after the Twitch livestream. Go subscribe to his Twitch channel! This masterpiece will change the way the Game is played.
Breath taking. Wow
Apart from everything, the countdown to this masterpiece was also something!  It gave me goosebumps.  That was a piece of great art itself.  I hope we'll have the chance to see that part again.
This is powerful. 10/10 as always Ren 🖤
Wow.
Outstanding! Ren you had a lot of time on your hands to educate yourself on how the world really works, that's evident. But what are we going to do to wake the sheep up, how do we wake them up? Is it even possible? Until they see what they've been sold is a lie and the real people that are really in charge use us as commodities then we're all doomed for WW3 that's being lined up right now. You're waking them up a little but we need more of people like you that can get the message across to the gullible sheep.
So many goosebumps from this masterpiece!
You are way beyond a musician. You are what people need. Keep it up, I wish you the very best. Your talent is truly amazing.
Beautiful, came here to have fun, stayed for the story, ended with a mixture of warm heart, melancholy, and hope. Essentially, a masterpiece. Ren truly is the Shakespeare of our time, hats off for respect, king.
I’m still reeling and now watching all the first time reactions in order to relive this moment over and over 😂 incredible ❤
Just genius
F$$king gorgeous masterpiece ❤ this is why I feel in love with your 🎶!
Ren you are Amazing
I saw a video of his I've never seen on tiktok, so I come to his channel to see he JUST dropped a new masterpiece
Wow, What a fantastic video for an amazing son!
I'm NOT just saying this as a fan I swear to god but REN you are probably the most creative artist of all time, I've never been so blown away by anyone and I'm a STAN 😂 amazing work bro you do the UK proud brother 💙
❤......
KILL IT BOY
Love you Ren!
The fact that the analogy with the kids story in pt. 2 counting step by step (1,2,3,4 etc) and in this you do kind of a throw back with counting up his age as the story progresses. I love you have my babies please thanks
Hey Ren! I've been following you for over 3 years now, and you keep blowing my mind with every song, every work and every project you realize. Also Sam, he is a role model for me as a cinematographer. You guys are a big inspiration for me. Thanks for being awesome :)
Every part of this is awesome.  It crosses so many genres and artistic forms. When you doing a full on musical? Thank you Ren!
Facts.  All hard facts.  Well done Ren and team.  You are truly talented and so unbelievably aware.  Keep exposing darkness to the light, so many more need to see & learn! 🙏
The blocking and cinematography never ceases to impress. Gorgeous strings too. Oh, and of course the lyrics, story telling and vocal range of an absolute auteur.  Your music and messages are so important, you have a gift, please continue to use it 👏🏻
Unreal again Ren!
Really brutal, album coming soon and this one will be played on loop. Genius.
Educated to be sheep ,blatant truths ! Another incredible peace ren !
Wow 😮 simply wow
w o w ....... Ren really goes next level in this..
I'm flabbergasted... That's a really good artist we have here guys.
You my friend are a genius.
Awesome video mate! ❤
You're a special soul my man.. I'd give anything to see you in person but I'm in America.. keep on keepin on ren you're a gem
Stay healthy Ren. You have a lot more to say.
When you keep dropping masterpiece after masterpiece and then this in its own category one can but to think ren don't have a limit🔥
Well fuck man❤
Wow. Just wow. I love all of this. From the hooded musicians harkening back to part 1, and the counting harkening to part 2,  to the ‘finger on the trigger’ line from both previous parts becoming a literal Chekov’s gun that is physically present and emotionally tied in to this one. This is such a well-crafted video. Absolutely phenomenal. Fuck the money game, indeed.
Brilliant, just brilliant. ❤  How do you make 9 mins feel like 2?  What time compression wizardry is this?  Are you the Doctor? Who rhymes, in a Tardis of time, bending minds to divine, intervention. Just. In. Time.  Thank you Ren.
Literally a master piece. Nothing but pure ART at its most primal. Thought provoking. Captivating. Gripping. Engrossing. My soul was yearning for a striking piece of artwork, a warm blast of sunlight and cold darkness that stirs something deep within the human condition, the human psyche. An intoxicating aroma of both despair and faith. Thank you REN! Thank you so very very much for this masterpiece! Thank you as well to the entire team, family, friends that helped and collaborated in order for this beauty to flourish. WE are all truly lucky to have you here, now in the present. REN you were the missing piece in a giant puzzle of life, art, and music. And I for one am extremely happy, fortuitous that we found you. Much love hermano. 🤘🏽💙🙏🏽
Goosebumps again ❤
Mate you looking real dapper in that suit ngl 🤩
This is exactly what we need. Make him viral, Ren will change the world
This truly is a masterpiece @knoxhill
Theres so much talent that Ren has honestly, with his vocals, lyrics, story-telling and his ideas in general shows how good of an artist/performer he is
Worth the wait 🎉
Fucking glorious my man. Absolutely amazing video and story. Shoutout to Sam as well. Amazing direction and filming.
Another Ren and Sam masterclass on how to make 9 minutes feel like 2.
Bro what a masterpiece!!! U are so very talented and I just love the way you mix poetry and camera work together to make the message even clearer man!
Absolute Genius, unbelievable.
Yet again ... a great thing!!
Ante ustedes señores el mejor artista de nuestros tiempos! saludos desde México Ren, queremos que vengas por favor
I look forward to Ren selling out Broadway with a musical!
Make sure to comment!
Like what the hell man leave some talent for the rest of us the way you weave songs and sentences together is just unreal
there's no chance of this getting thru at this point in the babble on, but🖕,,  REN,, you can work and ally with ADAM CURTIS_ PENNY RIMBAUD_PJ HARVEY_JASON WILLIAMSON_LITTLE SIMZ_,   let's push things forward, b. you almost hit it here. you've arrived on the stage. horizontal moves now. the next step is alliance
Incredible
Standing ovation 👏 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Wow so powerful. You blow me away with your intellect Ren.
Absolutely Brilliant!!!
Absolute Masterpiece my friend. Again, i dont think this is even a song. Its a message that the world needs to hear. I cant wait for the new album to be delivered, i got it for my son who loves your music. He was going through some tough mental times when we found you, and now well never be without you. We Love You Ren!!
As always, thank you for sharing Ren. We all we got  ✌
Wow. This was unbelievable!
Fantastic work!!!
That was epic OMGosh I can't believe I slept thru the premier tho
It’s not music, it’s not prose, it ain’t scripture, no novel, not a poem, it’s just pure Art! Creative, reflective, imaginative, perspective, abstract, up there with Picasso, Dali, Da Vinci, Botticelli, pure modern day fucking ART! GENIOUS BOI 😮
Incredible!
Comment
Whoa. That hit like the bat in MG1. Not remotely what I was expecting. But unlike a lot of things I see and read about daily, I FELT this. I'm sure the people in the room next to me are wondering why I'm standing in here performing thunderous, slow applause. F'ing genius. Well played sir. I'll probably have more to say once it finishes sinking in. The reactors (Love 'em all) are going to have to wait for a while. BRAVO!
Nailed it as always Ren is more than just a great artist he is a great man with a great crew around him . I applaud all involved in this . Love the strings , piano , cinematography all of it , deeper down the Ren rabbit hole I go .
❤
Wow! Fables for the modern world xx
Genius
Missed the premiere but just finished watching. I've fallen in love with you all over again, Ren. This is a masterpiece on so many different levels. I'm absolutely blown away 🌹💗🦇💗🌹
wow this is pure art
Top lad as always Ren
Simply Stunning!!
Brilliant as always Ren. I really appreciate your intellectual content that you produce man, such a change from the stuff that's forced out the the masses these days. So engaging from start to end! Thanks mate
Thank you Ren! You're a genious and this is a perfect masterpiece of poetry and film! Love your music! And videos! Cannot wait for a tour! Can't imagine how it would feel to hear you Live! Best wishes with your health, hope to see you soon 🙏
Preordered this titan of an album just now.  Haven’t been this excited for new music since Jeff Buckley appeared on the scene with Grace.
Perfect
Oh my God, friggin wow! That was absolutely amazing!
Another amazing song
Congratulations to Sam,,Ren and all those  involved, Watched once, still digesting and absorbing it all, will need to watch it again several times more, then over to the reactors and see how they score, we are all winners and losers, depending on how you view the race. Time to Be selfish and take care of yourself. We can not be united if we do not like ourselves. ❤
Merci infiniment Ren. Je vais encore pouvoir l'écouter si fort  tout le reste ma vie comme les autres et celle a venir ahah 😊
That was the first time that data was just so real ❤❤ too the world please let’s dance together 🇩🇰   Ren you are light 🫂
What is doing Ren on the toilet? - The Masterpiece.
Holy Shit, he did it again!
That was awesome man !! Great job
YOO!
Thought you couldn't show loading a firearm on YT?
You’re a genius.
I can't even.  This is art at its finest.  I'm so so proud of you Ren this had to feel amazing to drop! Can't wait for my cd to arrive❤
was that ren playing the piano?
It is literally indescribable how talented you are we are in awe of truly a modern day philosophical marvel
For the algorithm.... wow again wow.
Wow you are so awesome 😊
Ren has so quickly become my favorite artist. Every song hits so hard.
A true masterpiece.    Waiting for part 4!
This is more than music.
Hey Ren, just me.. I got a word or two to put it simply. Agnosticism is an ism just the same  Comes from not having proof  Faith is this.. and life is just a spoof on what really can be done  When God hears your words and the difference it makes and what is the point of reruns.  You have a skill God gave you but you snatch it from him.
*engagement*
best storyteller I've ever heard, with screech's tales, hi ren, and now this. all masterpieces. They rival homer's epics
Pre ordered the physical album for me and one for my brother. Can't wait to hold it in my hands!
chilling.
Yes! You’ve got it….on the Way. ❤ ✌🏼💜
OMG this is absolutely stunning!! The classical piece at the beginning sounds so familiar to me like Beethoven or Chopin but I'm not sure...also loved the way it flowed very nicely into the music ❤❤
Well done, very well done.
Dark.  But very well done.
So good as usual
Ren your one of a kind.  Even the odd people that say they don’t get you! Have to acknowledge that.   I do believe you will be one the artist that will be remembered 50 to 100 years from now. There not very many of them these days
Gossebumps, all the time, need to say more?
My mind is blown. The last two weeks have been impeccable, a masterpiece of a build up. Followed by an outrageously thought provoking piece.    Good luck with the album release, you deserve to be heard by the masses. Phenomenal once again, you've surpassed the expectations that Hi Ren created and that's no mean feat. This was so worth the wait. Kudos! Here's to food, cheer and song for all x
Absolutely brilliant
So timely Ren people so need to hear this!
Mans got strings, you cant go wrong with strings, or a piano 😊 well that left me exhausted in a good way
The comments are so loaded about the "magnificence" of this guys music that it looks very suspicious.
This is just pure art, such a sad story, but such beautiful music
No words to describe it, thank u Ren 💪
In awe... As usual! 😊
Totally drawn in the whole time. 😮👏🏻🔥
😮
That was the fastest 9 minutes I’ve ever experienced. Amazing.
Yes, Ren!!! I'm a bit gutted not to hear the Money Game chime that's in the other two, but that's quickly squished by thw joy of seeing your more theatrical work along the likes of 'Hi Ren' and 'The tales of Jenny & Screech'. I don't know which I'd rather see more of, so if you could just keep peddling out both, that's be great! 😉
fack meeeee.e... your a genius. i have said that for years, but legit rain wain, your a ruddy genius omfg bravo.bravo.... im so stealing you when AI takes over, Im savin you too...Human Being Atrium mate, you have a ticket...
Absolutely incredible.
Just because I think this talented rich man knows my pain, well it doesn't change me. He has assets and a Drive that compels him. I'm happy for him, even though I say that, RAGE, is filled in brain. Born by a failure and surrounded by failures, in a place that would be called home. I am compelled to be drawn to the void, RAGE!
Omg that was amazing!!!
Damn
Waw wah wahou ! Incroyable ! J'ai vu le live, et de réécouter la chanson après avec les paroles et tout tout, bah quel claque ! Et effectivement c'est un chef d'œuvre de créativité comme a son habitude, la chanson, les paroles sont génial, la musique, les instruments, le tournage, les costumes, tout, bref c'est trop bien ! Milles merci à tous pour ce moment inoubliable 🎉😊
I don't think I've ever heard someone rap to the beat of classical music before.
Wow! I didn't think you could top parts 1 and 2 but you really, really, did! Bravo, all who were involved - this is amazing work! ❤
All so real but destroying the planet as well as yourself.  When the aliens invade - save Ren - he'll show you how to save yourselves.
WOW !!
this isn't just a song, this whole music video is art. ren is so talented, and if you're reading this: i love you man, you inspire me so much! keep doing what you do!! <3
Ren, your music truly hits the soul. Your music and storytelling is always so eye opening. Please keep doing what you do. ❤
i was waching luigi an i see this just droped
just leaving this statement here.  I love Ren.
$& true
Loved it! So real.
My word that is Genius man, there is no other artist even like U in today's day & age so respect to original art & your big heart ❤
Wow, Ren! I can see why you are so proud of this! Seriously inspiring and awakening! Thank you for all you make and do, it matters! Tomorrow will be an incredible release day! Take care, bro! <3
Brilliant!!
No words. Seriously.
Love it!
Wow! Love you Sweetie Pie!
Speechless... Perfection, genius, you see the world as it truly is.. I adore Ren! ❤
It’s so cool to see how much REN’s music and subs etc have grown every few months. Smashing it. Brilliant music and buzzing for album
❤Ren HARE HARE HARE KRISHNA ❤   ..there is no spoon....   You are talented soul ❤    I'm not playing those games anymore ❤
Your heart and mind are both in the right spot! Great piece of art you created there!
Commenting for #s. Ren does it again. Gotta think on this!
Nothing compares……
Amazing!
walking with GIANTS brilliant Masterpiece Ren and the team. This is what is needed.. Blessings of light and love
My man! Wisdom on a beat...
shit dude you just get better and better.
Brilliant!
Holy mother of sweet Devine. Wow
this man never misses
One word…ART
Ren - Your an absolute poet & a genius ..... Kudos 🎼
Well fuck me slowly, fuck me hard and fuck me sideways. I've been looking forward to this and wondering where it would go. Absolutely awesome. As  always I am in awe of your talent and just devour everything you release.
This is just insanely good.... The tension is just of the chart!
Nice one
Another beautiful story
Wow.. powerful stuff
Wow this genius keeps getting better and better 💙😱
THIS IS WHY I LOVE YOUR MUSIC! It not only creates beauty, it tells a story. AMAZING AS ALWAYS GLAD IVE BEEN A FAN SINCE FOREVER. ❤❤❤
Ren, you're actually annoying me now. Leave some talent for the rest of us would ya. Masterpiece.
It's amazing how far you've come. I remember watching your stuff with The Big Push and thinking about how damn underrated you guys were. Now "Hi Ren" is at 20mil. Congrats man, deserved.
Everything you put out just blows my mind, you’re so talented!
This is what our kids will analyze in school
Found out who Ren was yesterday, man am I glad I stumbled upon this genius!
A storm, it comes our way.
okay what the fuck that was insane
You don't need me to tickle your balls Ren, but that was great.  Thanks for appearing.  Thanks for re-igniting my faith that meaningful music is not a thing of the past.  Never sell out lad, no matter what they offer you (and they will). Big love.
🙏 🙏
Ren has created a whole new genre. This is outstanding on every level!
I'll be honest, I was terrified Ren was actually going to do it. This whole thing seemed like pushing both positive change and the other end of extreme - death of humanity, which would just cause the whole sick cycle to repeat.  We're children. We don't know what we're doing. If we survive, if we heal, if we unite, then in a few hundred years, humans will look back and wonder what the hell was wrong with our species, and be glad it survived to learn and grow and become better.  But yeah, if we fail, it will be greed that does us in. We all hear about the 1%ers with their plan to live in holes like fat greedy rats. The thing is, rats are far more resilient than humans. They'll die like the rest of us, they might just live a few extra years.
Totally loved this @RenMakesMusic! You are the best story teller of this generation!
Simply amazing man!
WOW 😲
Faaaaaaark.....😮
❤❤❤
Thanks for elevating art and insight in the world <3
Incredible work guys!! 💕
best Thor's day ever as it has new mathafackin Ren!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! damn neechie you be looking fine in that suit, like umm,,, i think may be time to switch up the 90s track suits mates, lol, freaking love u sooo ruddy much,,, so so much
Now that's how you tell a story. The highest level of art.
Imagine what would be created if Ren was gifted a full orchestra and unlimited freedom to create a musical. IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN.
I am still processing the enormity of this. Yet another masterpiece from Ren the master storyteller.
i'm a fan.
Bravo 🎉
Masterpiece….one more time! Τι έκανες ρε μεγάλε?!
Ren remains authentic in a world full of filters, falsehoods, and flattery.
Feeling free together ❤
Thank you
Beautiful Ren 🥹🖤
Out the park…again!
Недавно открыл для себя его музыку. Это великолепно. Необычно и ново. Збс тащемто111🎶👍☮️
I love you Ren. I'm SO fkn grateful you're still around to share your art with us. I'm also really grateful I've managed to still be here too. This world has so much blackness and evil in it. We need to stick together more than ever! Thank you Ren! Thank you. 🫂🫂🫂❤❤❤
So good Ren!! Thank you for doing the work, the art! Next should be a story on a Dr, expose the healthcare system a bit. This was class pure class
fucking hell
No wonder you said you were proud .yum.just yum ren.
Brilliant! Absolutely, brilliant!!! 🔥🔥🔥
nothing compares to this
strikes again ❤
Wow, this is AMAZING!! Ren dude, this is absolutely a stroke of genius!! Stoked for the album tomorrow!!🤩
Fkn genius!
Turner Prize????? I'd vote for it!!!!!!
Wow. When you think you couldn't possibly create more he tripples it. Challenge accepted. Beautiful art and such truthful creativity. Well done Ren.
wow
Brilliant
A masterpiece, nothing like it anywhere else! Congrats Ren, what an epic buildup to the release!
still no Paypal or other options. Debit Cards are uncommon in parts of Europe. Youre missing out a decent chunk of potential customers
It’s fascinating to see an individual of such talent truly understand his medium of communication. What the Beatles and the Beach Boys understood about 8 track and what Christopher Nolan understands about IMAX, Ren understands about social media.  How to use it in a way that transcends what it is to create art.
I got two terms for counterfeiting in the mid 2000s, trying to make a statement about the value of paper money, & how much more artistry went to into making fake money than real money. Then I was homeless for 6.5 years even though I could have easily printed the money I needed to get myself off the streets. All this after spending 20+ years trading everything important in life for some meaningless bs, lining the wallets of a bunch of rich old white dudes in suits for whom I was nothing more than a line item on an Excel spreadsheet.  I’ve got some feelings about money in our society. ✌🏼
God
Brilliantly done❤❤❤
Such great storytelling. Catchy too.
No words to say other than brilliance!! A true artist.
The insideous side of parasitical capitalism! The tape worm of greed your unaware you live with!!!! 🤔🤨
This is amazing 🔥❤️
Woah
Holy. Fucking. Shit. Dude.
Wow. It is a masterpiece!
Fuxin love u man bravo ❤❤❤
Whoa! REEENNN! I was expecting a masterpiece and you totally delivered from beginning to end. Your musical genius coupled with your old soul thoughts are the pinnacle of mastering and evoking emotions. Take a bow Sir Ren, you've outdone yourself once again! And Sam's videographer skills are mad! Much love, peace and happiness!
Рен, ты исключительно прекрасен. Это невероятная сила — уметь передать что-то таким образом, чтобы человек на другой стороне все понял, даже не зная языка. Это гениально. И тем не менее, когда начинаешь погружаться в текст(тут, конечно, желательно знать язык;)), то открываешь для себя еще большую многогранность твоего таланта. Это чудесно. Пожалуйста, продолжай творить 🤍
❤❤❤❤omg!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
Money game in general has been on repeat for weeks. Amazing job Ren.
I'm this guy, anxious, will i appreciate next song as I love this one..?? It's now been 6 months ago and so many songs, so many different  styles, this "guy" never "disappointed" me, if I can tell,  As Liv say "I'm in Love" Thank you ❤🎩😘
Holy fuck
❤❤❤❤❤
It’s beautifully put together, such a masterpiece. He brought something so profound from this that I was stunned, it’s absolutely wonderful and eye opening to the money game we all partake in.
Another masterpiece ❤❤
🎯💥  Outstanding, Ren & Sam 🎉🥳 Just Outstanding! 👊💥💯👏👏👏👏👏
❤❤❤
Those camera shots were neats, great performance!
and again, a genius song, a brutal performance, a tense and wonderful idea ..and at the end, instead of the lowered curtain, a shot 🖤
What the fuck… 😮
Fantastic REN!
❤❤❤you blow my mind!!!❤❤❤
Absolute masterpiece  Thank you 🖤
I just played Money Game 1 2 and 3 back to back.  That's all so true, and so powerful.  The most meaningful use of a musical talent that exceeds all previous experience.
This made me cry. So truthful and well executed. ❤
Ren you are the best
Eh it's ok  In all seriousness another hit. Not as good as some of his others and I a bit slow placed but still great
Level 100.
This is 🔥🔥🔥
Holy shit what a deam good masterpice. Thank's Ren. Youre Musik is amazing!
I love this Ren & Sam, this is a great work of art. You are right pointing out the hypocrisy in the world and the flaws of a capitalist system. Great art is thought provoking and encourages dialogue. Although it is flawed, there is a certain amount of choice in the capitalist system, you can create in that system and vote etc. I don't know what your idea of utopia is Ren? In my opinion, the utopian idea cannot and has never worked as we are all flawed human beings. Once you bring in a system like that, you have no creativity, no free will, no ability to vote it out and no inspiration or ability to think and create. Can we all make personal choices about how we behave and how we treat each other, absolutely. Can we teach our children good values, yes.Just don't get fooled by the idea of utopia, anyone who has been to the Killing fields in Cambodia knows how that turns out. Brilliant work Ren and Sam (and team), I can tell how much work you put into creating this. Thanks for the great, thought provoking music/art.
The man just gets better and better with everything he does.
369....How bad IDEALS progress.... Truth here!
Holy shit this video is art in the purest sense of the word, the cinematography was amazing I commend the fuck out of the camera man.
This music video is beyond impressive! This is the pinnacle of one-take cinematography. And Ren you and your team pulled this off absoloutely beautifully. Maddest of respect.
Totally original. Epic craftsmanship ❤
He has done it again… This man is a masterpiece with rapturous encore… 🙏🏼 Protect him…
❤❤❤no words to express you are just too magical XOXO ❤❤❤
Incredible
Certified art that will change and save many many lives ! Thank you Ren!
He’s just so wonderful and I love him
This isn't entertainment... wow.
Phenomenal!!!!!!!!! You did it again 📣
All the riches in the world can´t buy a sense of self love..... this was another masterpiece! That´s not opinion that is a fact.
I feel lucky to have made it to 54.  During my forties, I owned a 9mm.  I played with it.  The years gone by..... But it has been MUSIC that has helped me live on and "prosper."
I adore this man's pure talent at storytelling. Magical
Brilliant again.
HO-LY SHIT
Love the support Ren gets from other creatures and fans alike. Amazing artists make us all better humans. Thank you to Ren and the others helping him give us art.
Quickest 9 minutes ever. That's what art does when you're engaged. Left speechless, once again.
F@cking hell, don't know what else to say, glad to be witness to genius in my lifetime
Wowser. Amazing. Take a bow Ren & Sam 👏👏👏💪
I dont believe in reincarnation but fk me shakespeare has returned ☮️
Brilliance personified. Absolutely stunning!
Damn
Damn that was intense. Set aside the brilliance of the words - Ren's acting is so good!
This fucking guy is a genius, You Will Change The World Ren.
Damn this is dark
Thank you for this
What a damn masterpiece 🔥🔥🔥
Ren this was amazing from you and everyone else involved xx ❤🐢 xx
I've just discovered your music and my mind is blown. You're a fucking artist man, thank you for sharing your art 🖤

Great song and video. Ren is a musical master. He can play, write, sing, and amaze. Keep up the great work!
Absolutely fantastic 👏 yet again you have gone way over the raised bar i couldn't blink while watching. I will be coming back to watch that quite oftan.❤
Amazing as usual, amazing rap & story this is why i love you man!
For thy algorithm!
Ren is 33 and he already wrote his Bohemian Rhapsody
What an amazing talent Thank you Ren
Holy shit brother, OUT OF THE BALLPARK BASES LOADED GRAND SLAM!! Fuck YES, I only discovered you 2 months ago, I walked around with Pneumonia like symptoms for FIVE fucking years  while they tossed me from doctor to doctor, I had 10+ Primary care doctors that just dropped me for one reason or another, over 5 years with it!!I was coughing up blood!!!! They gave Exactly ZERO SHITS about healing or diagnosing me. They were only concerned with trying to bleed me dry with money first up front  like leeches.. I love ALL your music and your story and vibe are just battering me, Im a sobbing wreck after listening to half of them, the others have me cheering at you like a Malcom x for  all humans, You are a blessing , but their curse! Be safe, and be blessed for you bold, intelligent, Insightful, magical gifts to our healing, I love you brother, HUG
Dope!
How the hell do you keep one upping yourself man? Fucking brilliant!
Dope!
Truly something special. A mixture of song and theatrical performance. Genius. People will be talking about this and Ren decades from now.
I've been obsessed following your music, since the first time I saw you on youtube. CONGRATS REN, THANK YOU.
what else can you say but holy shit
Ren is a Teacher opening the Eyes of Millions with his Art and his Heart! If enough of Us actually LISTEN to his words, then Maybe, Just Maybe the Hunan Race may Survive!
Just one word ::::::::  bravo ,
Not a fun game at all
Lol it shouldn't be Renmakesmusic, it should be Renmakesart.
I'd like to get inside your head and travel around it for a while. The creativity of this piece is just mindblowing. Keep it up Ren, a hell of an artist you are mate!
Just wow
Dude, what the heck are you doing with my brain? Nine minutes and I thought it was only two. Man keep something for next year !!
👍🏻
Bravo !
Sometimes you cross on something that makes you rethink your life… and the timing couldn’t be more precise, just learn that I’m going to be a father for the second time!!  It truly is a masterpiece!!
I am speechless. An absolute masterpiece, start to finish.
What are the odds that my shuffled playlist of over 1k songs played part 2 of this song right before I enters YouTube😂  Only to see this video at the top of my recommendations
Very well done. You won't stop the machine though. People know many things damn well but do it anyway. Weather it's a means to an end or and end to a means. Here we are and there we'll go.
This is a pure MASTERPIECE!
Incredible. This is a full on piece of theatre.
Genuinely speechless man. So grateful to be living in the era of YouTube to witness this greatness. Wow.
Chills. Hi Ren was probably the most impactful piece of art i've found in the last few years because it hit me personally as I've been struggling with a number of diseases, surgeries and health issues for the past 3 years.  But this and the whole money game series are just so breath taking in both the quality and the message. Keep singing the songs that matter and know that to me and my life you have made a difference even if only a small one. We have so much potential if we could just stop wasting it.
Holy Shit Ren. Absolutely amazing and 500% worth the wait.
Everything you do is gold!
Wow
This is so awsm to be a part of! What a talent!
This video is incredible
jimmy had an eventful life
Money Game part 3? oooh I'm ready to hear some real shi
Nice 1 Ren, another banger.  I actually thought you were up against it to level up after Money Game 2.  So if your taking challenges for the concept of money game 4 do it about the strawman.
Like most, I've been a fan of Ren since being introduced to him and his music through "hi Ren" and I had never heard anything Quite like it until today and the release of money game 3.  This video and this song just continues to show his growth and maturity from the camera work to the sound design , Ren is in a class unto his own and I feel as fortunate as all of you to be here and now as we continue to watch his assent.  Although Ren has been somewhat under the radar and steadily gaining speed and notoriety for the past year or so. After this, I don't see how the world can ignore him.   This is a masterpiece a master class. A piece of art. I'm not even going to try to define it because it is subjective to each and every one of us and that will just take away from its greatness. I hope the whole world hears this song and finds its way through the entirety of his catalog of art.
Completely awesome!! Well done
Egoistic pursuit is so small and doesn't matter so I don't understand why it continues with so many examples of how poorly ego serves the soul.
comment for ren in case the algomoneyrithm cares
Historic. Generational. Talent.  Insight.   I personally will never forget your music, and I don't think the world will either, at least those that take notice....
I love this dedication and love for your work. It makes everything amazing.
This is going to blow up—superb work, as usual, Ren and Samuel
Awesome as usual!
One for the I go, you go, we algorithm
Wow
Masterful
Masterpiece.. Keep going, and let us listening forever. You're a genius, love from France.
.
outstanding
Absolutely mind blowingly good. Don't often get goosebumps from music, but just wow!
You captivate all my attention with all your songs. Wow!!!
Love this
Formidable, le baise l'argent risque de ne pas plaire a tout le monde mais moi ça me plait sacrement, jusqu'a un certain point le portrait de cette individu est tel qu'on pourrait y reconnaitre pas mal de nos dirigeants politiques , financiers, bravo pour ce texte et musicalement toujours tres fort!
Let's gooo, let's blow this video up!
Wow!!  Hauntingly Beautiful!! 🩵🩶
U never disappoint
CAPTIVATING! Never stop being you. 🖤
I am 50 I thought nothing more would surprise me! And then REN happens, you are art, you ren you are the hope in grandeur in music, talent, storytelling, drama, you REN are all in one! Thank you
Feeding the algo for Ren...Looking forward to Ren making movies or dystopian "Black Mirror" type show....Here for it!
I'm speechless.
Love it ❤️  never know what youre going to get with Ren. Again 10 minuets that enter a time warp. Where did they go??.xx
Marvelous, simply marvelous
Amazing theatrics!!! I love that style. Amazing work
Ren is an amazing storyteller. His ability to educate, entertain, and make you think is an amazing gift.
Absolutely outstanding filmmaking!
❤ much love
Gobsmacked😮 Bravo Ren and Sam and production team and cast. Congratulations and wild applause for all of you. 🎉❤❤❤🙇‍♀️
Absolutely brilliant 👏
Wow - this is AMAZING!
Your music and videos not only touches my soul, but grabs it. It makes it happy, sad, and makes it smile, and want to dance. It hits me differently that any other music heard. Your an artist my friend, and know that it has purpose in my life!!! Thank you!!!
👏👏👏👏
Never fails to Shock, Inspire, Laugh, cry or surprise...
This is magnificent!  Album preordered and can’t wait to get it!
Brovo
i usually dont comment, but more people should see this!
That is exceedingly brilliant, and so sadly the truth. Rap on sweet angel cz  I totally feel your game.....MammaLlamma
Well done 👏😊
wow.
Storrytelling and a true message. Thank you🙏
Damn! Chills!!!
Blown away! Yet another masterpiece.  A grim one sure enough.
WOW
Just pre-ordered the vinyl.  Ren, you have infinite talent!  I am SO GLAD I discovered your music!  Money Game Part 3 is an absolute masterpiece.  Can't stop listening!
Amazing!
An artist makes art, and consumers consume, but no less a work of art is the pain that's exhumed - in the viewer, in the artist, in the space that they share; healing circles like a shark when our games are laid bare.
Feels a lil repetitive and try hard
What a song, more like a musical and drama combined, I love ittt!!
I fall to my knees before this grandiose epic
Ren have you ever considered going on Timcast irl?
Comment for the algorithm...
21000 people watched 19000 likes .... masterpiece ...
Holy shit, that was dope
Cuck the algorithm! Beautiful masterpiece Ren!
I don't even know what to say. No way my brain can process this after watching it only once. I'll be back in 8-9 listens.
Fck me! What a fucking piece of art this is 😮❤ absolute goosebumps again
i don’t even comment on videos but this is a work of art
Damn
Absolutely amazing camera work… And genius music as always
Wow!
right now I don't have words that will do justice to this piece of art, maybe after 2 or 11 more listens I will.
Hunter Biden minus intelligence 😮
Very nicely done.
this is so good
Nice one ladddddd 🏆 🏆🏆
Holy shit. I'm rocked again.
When an artist makes you stop and listen to them for almost 10 minutes straight, you can be sure is a true artist! Ren is definitely something else! 🤌🏾🎼
This is not a song, a track, this is art at its deepest form. He has power that very few have in todays age. He manages to encapsulate so many lessons and delivers it to us to pick it apart and really understand his message. Truly the best artist I have ever seen.
Another masterpiece by Ren, can't wait to hear it all in one go also without the stops for the video theatrics. 🔥🔥
Fastest nine minutes of my life! Really spectacular Ren! ❤
One hour ?
I am amazed ren, so excited for the album
Amazing!
Ren you are also an incredibly talented actor! Your lyrics are amazingly presented amazing ideas and your music is genius. Something in your brain is working brilliantly
This is a story of modern times.  The education system turning out sheep, for the university shepard's.  Money is an invention because somebody traded rice for a camel, and wrote an IOU.  thanks to them, they started turning the wheel of humanities greed. just remember... she sells sea shells by the sea shore....
Wow, every time just wow. Your creating a legacy of masterpieces
It's amazing how many people don't know greed and corruption dooms us all. Thanks for your continual effort to point it out.
Wow... just wow.
Imagery reminds me of Mars Volta - Frances the Mute
Ren this is brilliant ❤x
🔥⭐🔥Art
Master piece Ren.
SPEECHLESS! 👏👏👏
Awesome track, thankyou ♥ I dont see innovation so much these days, All I see now in this world is greed, this track how ever was innovation and intelligence and I loved it
What can i say ??? It blew my brains out too ...... awesome 🖤
Holy shit, that was amazing
The art of the free mind continues ❤
Damn Masterpiece! Im thinking Part 1 and 2 - Part 3 cant be better! Finally it s out a new Artist the World needs! Incredible Talent!
Worth the wait...Ren is out of this 🌍
Stunning
Incredible! Will take a while to process and appreciate all the nuances of the artistry.
Oh Ren. Thank you ❤
Idk y but I listen to ren in the gym to work out to lol
Genius.
This was amazing! I cant believe how good this was! AMAZING!!
OMG. This is powerful and shocking.
It’s beyond music…………
WOW JUST WOW
Holy shit Ren! Thanks for this masterpiece.
Great song, Great video and of course a GREAT Artist!!!
not much to say aside from...this is an ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE
Epic, masterful! Thanks so much not only for the music, the video, but the commentary on society.
Perfect way to bring a 3rd song to this trilogy
I hope Ren continues to release content like this. Especially going after greed. Society needs a shift away from the idea greatness comes from your ability to put the boot down on others' necks. When the 99% views immense wealth and greed as a sickness and a weakness, we'll see change. Well, I won't. I'll be dead, but you kids get out there and change the World.
I am so amazed, because I just recently discovered you. Love the storylines that you’re using in every song of yours! You have a very unique and remarkable style! I love it!🫶🏻
Will the human race ever learn...  Love is the prize nothing else  Damm Ren your connecting on a level that's not been seen before 💚
Damn...need I say more?
Amaazing as every! the showmanship <3 Thanks for sharing another story
Can only watch it tomorrow, but want to leave a comment for a little bit of extra algorithm push - continue your great work, Ren, your art is amazing and your personality really inspiring! Greetings from Germany :)
Dude, you just don’t disappoint
The amount of respect i have for this Man is unbelivable. Ren if you reading this i just want to say that your music truly helped (and still helps) me with going thru life. I want You to keep going, and keep making what you love because this is the way that you teached me. I battle with severe depreesion, PTSD and social anxiety so your work touches me on many levels. You made me smile many times and keep going with wrining my own songs and this is priceless.  Thank You so much ❤
Truly an idiosyncratic artist. Very rare to see in todays times
Wow!
Just wow
Ren is another word for Genius  This is absolutely insane; 9minutes flew by and left me wanting more
😮
❤
more brilliance as expected
You think comments boost its chances in the algorithm? This is undoubtedly the BEST SONG EVER!
If you are new to ren, you're still early! BIG UP rest of us OGs , can't wait to receive my physical album❤ we are all going to be blow away how far Ren will go even from here!
Just wow. Took my breath away.
Simply amazing, well done sir
Ren holds a mirror up to the world and dares us all to look into it - another piece of incredible artistry ❤❤❤
Wutt?!?! Ren knows no bounds.
Already preordered ❤
Holy shit, this was genuinely unsettling. I could feel my adrenaline rising with the music. Good job getting your point across. The tension is real and it’s splitting our world apart, the fact that I could feel the pull and fear and hopelessness of our own design yanking on my hair as I watched this is amazing!
OMG.  Masterpiece!
Geeeeeez, these single takes are just absolutely and wonderfully exquisite 😘👌💯❤️‍🔥 Edit: It's the type of beauty that brings a single tear to a stoic person's eye
BRAVO sir BRAVO 👏
So good!
The master of it all great filmaorpy
What do you even call this?? “Song” doesn’t exactly do it justice, right? Performance art? Poetry in motion? A freaking master class on creativity in storytelling? I’m completely blown away right now…well freaking done Ren! Congrats! Can’t wait for the album drop tomorrow! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Thank you for another journey Ren. <3
LETS FUCKING GO REN, been here from the start and will be till the end. Inspirational
Man, I love that artists can now make it on sheer talent. No record label would let you do this stuff. And, yet it is so vitally needed.   I tell you this, when Ren books a show I am there. Anywhere on earth.
REN, the musical. . on Broadway. . off Broadway
Why did this make me cry.
How do you do this Ren?????
Outstanding!!!! Took it up a gear again wow
I can't wait to see Ren in concert live. I know his live show would be amazing.
Utterly magnificent.
No words except masterpiece can describe this Ren ❤
Is it finally ok to say Ren is the the most creative music artist going and simply just the best artist going right now in any genre of music.. please somebody attempt to change my mind, anyone.. let’s debate  Edit:  everyone involved with this project did amazing
Wow. Just wow. I actually have no words other than wow
Genius... I know a word that's used to describe good coffee by today's youth but I mean it in a genuine way 😂
Ar firs I was not shur but the oh shit
Ngl, turned off after a min...nothing was happening
top tier!
You guys absolutely killed it with this video! Cracker song and a insane video to match it! Well done to Sam with the mind-blowing cinematography
OH MY!!!
I don't know why I'm crying but I'm happy I pre-ordered the album.
I'm... I'm just gonna sit here a minute. Ya'll go ahead, I'll catch up.
🌹
All of the best music has relevance
*Tzhuuh tzhuuh!!    RenTrain is here, all aboard!!"
Wow simply amazing 👏
love it
I have never witnessed as much division in my 47 years of living.
Absolutely breath taking!
This is such a masterpiece! The last line even gave me chills.
🔥🔥🔥
This is utter madness. I've no idea how Ren keeps producing these masterpieces
Absolutely incredible! god bless you.
Absolutely incredible! It was worth every second of waiting!❤❤❤❤❤
I started watching your concent since Money Game Part 2 (Thank you Luigi), and I cannot believe how far has you come, we love you Ren
POwerful powerful video..  I will be surprised if Google doesnt take it down though.. Not that I mind, but this snowflake society we live in , corporations get scared when they see stuff like that because it comes a liability to them.  I hope they dont take it down... Good work like always. Love you man.
You outdo yourself every time! I love how your brain works. This is brilliant ❤👏👏
Holly fuck man, you're just a miracle to the industry, keep up the good work man, really love your story telling and your style of your art. Much love man ❤
How does he do it ? Ren just keeps getting better and better. Just when we thought he couldn't possibly top his last ( I won't call it song ) masterpiece of art, here he is with something brand spanking new. Is there no end to this man's talent ? ....... I do not believe there is. He keeps raising the bar. Astonishing 🙏
Thank you Ren. No music has spoken to me more than yours. Please, never change
No one tells a story like Ren!....No one...i know this has nothing to do about Ren..but our world is a really fucked up place so im glad i have YouTube  and Ren to watch..🙏🙏😕 .love ur stuff as so many others do Ren..❤❤
This is fantastic and hopefully will open a lot of eyes. Ren, you're an awesome artist.
Wowoowowowowoow
Such passion in every performance. Top notch dude. Keep on writing those hits kid. Ommmmmm
As soon as I saw it was 9min long...i KNEW it was gonna be EPIC! ❤❤❤
Goosebumps 😮
Please make the little money game figurine which is standing on the desk in the middle of the clip available for purchase in the shop!
It's Petri dishes all the way down. Phuk moguls, like Kendrick said "I'd rather be a bum". Sorry to get negative in your comments. People being goaded into arguing over their rights, while having all fiscal liberties stripped is breaking me down a bit.
This is mindblowing. I love it!
No words! Outstanding performance and you deserve an Oscar, Tony and Grammy for this outta this universe master piece! 👏🫶👏🫶👏
wow ren that’s so good
WTF. He doesn’t miss. It’s amazing what happens when you make art for a purpose and not for a dollar.
That was bloody brilliant, oh my god. I am literallly speechless, all I can say is that it was amazing and you speak only facts, man. Great fucking job!
I like the storytelling. .I get it. felt he shouda dressed the part; expensive suit, fitted shirt to play that guy. .to BE Jimmy. this one strategically left out the music (mostly). Your vids should be discussed in HS and college classes (philosophy, music, song writing/poetry, history, sociology and economics). ¨Mike, what class you taking?¨. . ¨Ren 101¨ ..¨Oh I´ve got Ren 2.0¨. . ¨cool¨
Wow, great work. The transitions were amazing, very powerful piece of art!
Absolutely amazing piece of art!
Perfection!❤
I just had one of those moments that hit you right in the gut.  There are people in the world just like me.  Others that can see beyond what others view.  Others that question and feel they can't just follow or accept things as they are. Ren you are inspiring and have reminded me it's good to be different.
Woooooooooow 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯 sheer genius!! 🤯🔫
this is awesome!!
Ren needs to do Broadway!!!
Good job, I love your stuff.
Your dream of a communist utopia will always be destroyed by those who crave power and control
Strong Message. Pure Art. Keep on Going Ren.
Beautiful work.
Sooooo good!!! 🔥 🔥 🔥
Love it !!
Holy shit dude.  That was awesome.  A sad commentarty... but awesome.
another work of art
Ren, you're an absolute genius. The intrinsic complexity behind every single rhyme that you write is bewildering. You are the creme de la creme when it comes to rappers, incomparable, unfadable, timeless, innovative, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. Thank you for this marvelous piece of art. It was produced with such power that if every member of our species was to halt their daily activities momentarily and visualize the message, it would serve as the rightful panacea to world chaos.                               Please have my kids i have limerence for you ren
Aaaaaaaannd…. He’s done it again!   Goosebumps every damn time.
Art, nuff said
A work of art ❤ Your Album is already one of the greats
An idea that hit me was when you said the last line about his finger on the trigger of a Money Game, that you'd normally come in with the chorus "oh rain, rain, rain" and that's what's happening all through the last part of the video when it's spraying down... Absolutely genius👌
Love it!!!!!!!!!!!❤
Read Marx. Read Lenin.
musician singer composer actor producer.  amazing sound and camera. intelligent critical deep hopeful. you're a virtuous man.
Another banger
Very nice....
New REN album. YES.
Oh my, Ren, You are my biggest discovery on the internet ever. You bring back hope that single human being can stand up against all odds and simply WIN! What You create is pure gold. I salute You.
Wow, the production quality and everything was topnotch 😙👌
Blown away 🐽❤️
We all now know why REN said it’s his best yet….  Fucking amazing
Absolutely BRILLIANT as always Ren 👏 ❤
Ren is such a powerful Storyteller. His art is real art. Just amazing.
What a great experience was to listen to this with all of you for the first time! Wow
How does Ren make 9 minute long music videos and make them feel only 2 minutes long. I was left wanting more 🤣
🔥🔥🔥
Damn you know how to hit us in the feels!
Captivating!!
The effort Ren puts into his creative work is    astounding
The story was so real it did not feel like a 9 minute video, it was so immersive it felt like 3 minutes
Thank you Ren and Samuel
Such an amazing artist love your work your such an inspiration greetings from belgium
Leaving a comment for the algorithm. This is a MASTERPIECE!!

WOW! I couldn’t even focus on the story yet because that one-shot is just next level! YES REN!!!
I think that you are too great of an artist to compare you to any other but if I had to :) Lin-Manuel Miranda. You two are a gift to art and to humanity. And Sam, holy hell, the perfect partner to convey your message. I wish I could live long enough when they talk about you in history books. You are changing the world and I am so excited for it.
Holy crap, that was just brilliant.
Standing here making breakfast and getting ready for the day, nips on full beam and skin crawling with goosebumps watching this. Epic! You’re all so so creative!
Speechless
This is insanely good! I have no words

Lobe it !
You've done it again Ren that's all I can say ❤
Name something better you could do in 9 minutes?    Didn't think so.
There are masterpieces that change and record culture for posterity--Mona Lisa, The Sistine Chapel, The Last Supper--of which we give respect to their creators--Leonardo Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Leonardo.  Let us never forget Ren Gill for his contribution to our posterity for his messages and preserving our culture through art and spoken word.
Outstanding.
Truly a masterpiece. The bar has been raised yet again sir.
Incredible portrayal of humanity’s greatest flaw. Some commented that Ren is “woke”. Fucking fools
I have no words. Mind blown. 🤯
Bravo 🎉
Speechless... and true. as always thank you so much Ren !
I'm convinced that Ren buys the movie sets from the saw films lol!
This is art that exceeds the impact of anything in a gallery imo.
Bravo 🎉
This is absolutely no1 the word play the dynamics of it all is outstanding 👏 i do applause you ren. I expect nothing more and nothing less . Thank you ren legend 🙌
Wauw, just wauw! ❤
Just say WOW.....didn't expect this...very intense and very well made.
Now everyone knows how to spell genius:  R - E - N
Wow😮😮😮😮
In a word, WOW! ❤
superb piece of art - keep your videographer, your styles work really well together
Bravo 🎉
Jeeesus   REN... What an f-ing beast to be reckoned with!!!
“The further a society drifts from truth, the more it will hate those who speak it.”   Keep shouting, Ren.
A masterpiece ❤
2023 is REN’s Year!
so much here to follow - i suspect i'll be watching this over and over while trying to unpack it all over the next few days
You met all my expectations for part 3. Thank you
When i seen the the notification that this was released my and started listening to it my mouth was just dropped to the flow for a couple minutes
Wow
Holy......... Fuck. Ren this is so true of todays' life, and for you to put it to lyrics and making it beyond connectable on so many levels. Another masterpiece by our boy Ren!
habrá que inventar un nombre para el tipo de arte que Ren hace
👏👏👏👏👏👏
Love it
Leaving a comment without a comment. This song is too big for comments. This song is above all
thank you, again.
Para el algoritmo.
Great points but I don't like Jimmy's solution... The system is set up to be like this but you don't have to take part of you don't want to. It's all about the community! Thanks Ren you legend ❤
"His finger on the trigger of money game. Oh rain rain rain rain a storm it comes our way." The way this comes full circle almost like a prediction really blew my mind. Sure enough, a storm did come. Plenty of more well-spoken and knowledgeable people are going to be talking about this, so I'll just say congratulations, and this was awesome.
Love Ren and love his soul, but his fans seem to me to be slowly formed into a herd of sheep. No need to praise one man shouting truths, praise the truths instead and feed your energie into listening instead of worshipping.
This is why I love listening to Ren. It's not just music.  It's the emotions, appeal, and art that speaks to people across  the entire spectrum of life.❤ Amazing.
I need to stop putting on my makeup before have a Ren session. 😭 I have never been one to idolize or obsess over famous people, but I'm pretty sure I'm in love with Ren's spirit/energy. I really hope I can meet him someday...I would love to have a writing sesh with him.
That was an artistic masterpiece. Got my vinyl pre-ordered, I can't wait to add it to my collection.
Beautiful Inspiring Mind-blowing
Fantastic!
Just 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Amazing video - well done, Ren!!  I'm amazed at your talent.
Loved so much about it. Brilliant work!  What's the current record for number of masterpieces? 😄
I don't have the words to convey how masterful this is.  I didn't think you could transcend Hi Ren, but this...wow.  Just wow.
Algorithm
FANTASTIC REN❤
Love it, Absolutely the best part of the Money game Trilogy, Genuis , so much truth..... Brilliantly Done As usual Ren. You really K*llied it on this one!!!!👏🎬🎶💯

No Way! Another one
I feel like the mask is a representation of Plato's allegory of the cave. We lack enlightenment and thereby remain blindfolded and chained.
This is perfection. Thank you so much for sharing this masterpiece!
EVERYONE HAVE TO BE ORGANIZE WITH YOUR COMMONS CAMARADS, LET'S FIGHT, THE UNIQUE THING WHAT WE HAVE TO LOSS IS OUR ROPE, TO CREATE A EVERYPOSSIBLE HOPE !
Even better than expected! You're lifting the game, Ren. Another brilliant masterpiece - the words, instrumentals and videography so on point!!
Stunning.

Ren, you've exceeded my expectations once again. I've watched it 3 times and I still can't find the words. Thank you for all you do, your hard work has paid off, this is incredible.
Opera d'arte..Stupefacente  Ren.❤❤❤
Take a crap in a bucket you guys think it’s awesome now as long as you say, it’s Ren
I can't express it with words. This is really a masterpiece
for algorithm
This is one of the most beautiful works of art I've ever seen. I was shocked and in awe when listening to Hi Ren, but this song surpasses that and takes its place as one of the most thought provoking labors of love on the internet. Thank you Ren!
Frig the money let's get that mushroom game on
Got goosebumps all over! This is really something else!
I hope he writes musicals some day. Such a great storyteller. Thanks, Ren!
absolutely incredible. From every angle. Visuals. sound effects. Lyrics. music. performance. Beautifully tragic.
Ren out here dropping multiple 9 minute long amazing songs with videos deeper than the ocean for fun. Gotta love this man and what he does.
Just simply stunning ❤ Ren please never change and continue to be the unique anomaly that you are with the music masterpieces that you create 🫡 Thank you for blessing our ears and minds with the songs you share with us 🫶🏻
wow❤❤❤
Absolutely brilliant
Wow! I have chills and started crying.. Absolutely brilliant!
Holy fucking shit
It's f..kin Orwell, Dickens, Kubrick in the 21st century. This is something special and the man that is Ren is doing my head in, amazing just f..kin amazing!!!❤
Take a bow, the curtain call in this was inevitable but also as moving as the tide of corruption displayed. Big love
this is great, and the clip so well shot! just a masterpiece in my opinion.
Shock and Awe.  F*ck me Ren's done it again, but done it better?!
I have no words…. ❤
See you on Broadway, Ren. 😍
Wow wow wow. Masterpiece and painstakingly accurate for this day and age 😢
Bravo 👏
I’m in a diner with ear buds in and hit play for my viewing of this chapter. From the first note the goosebumps and tears burst out and my emotions are all over the map. Ren you have launched this into orbit. Thank you so very much. ❤❤❤🎉
IT IS SAD THAT many reactor videos have 25-50% or more of the views already to this video that they are reacting on.   Make sure you reactors are getting people to come to watch the actual video
👏👏👏👏👏
This is not only a good song but lyrically so worthy, deep respect.
Blown away by the sheer masterpiece that I've just witnessed.
So much packed in the words of this song. Nothing that we didn't already know, but hopefully the song will give people pause to think about their lives and if they are living theirs the way they want. Great lyrics and video. Props to everyone involved in the making.
A cautionary tale from the perspective of Ren. Bloody brilliant.
I feel like you can make a "play" this is art and far above youtube!
And I have trouble putting together a proper "Good morning" 😳 damn, son! Artsy as Mozartsy
Just incredible 👌
part 4?
Barber asks,'' what cut u wanting.'' Everybody after watching this song be like, '' Give me the REN cut.''
Shh LL
Wow.
I have to say is wow wow wow
Masterpiece again.
Fcking ace that man ❤
Wow. I never comment on anything but Ren, god damn you did it again, as I knew you would! Every song you drops HITS. The effort.. the countdown, your guitar playing, your piano skills, your voice, your prose, and most importantly the message is priceless. You are starting a revolution. I am glad that your fans are from all ages and backgrounds. This music will shape a better future, will save many and has even saved me. Thank you for giving me music I'm EXCITED about. Music that feeds the heart. Heartfelt. Thank you for inspiring me to find my strength, and thank you for being there in those dark moments of mine. You are a musical genius, and that makes you special. What makes you even more special is your heart. Keep going. Much love from a fellow human being who 100% supports you for life!
WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. right when you think every single piece of his genius has been highlighted .. he comes with yet another masterpiece. Every single detail- the music, poetry, the tone, and the emotions that pour out of it all is so fucking beautiful and heavy and real! He allows you to see it all ..his storytelling is never flat or one sided. We get to be the audience without trying ❤ Goddamn..mad respect and appreciation to you @RenMakesMusic and Sam ..
What can I say! Ren himself is a unique genre.
According to Google, there are 41 primary genres of music. Ren makes 42.
Masterpiece 👏
wow
Of course I'm surprised,  no matter how hyped I was the result is far better than I could have ever hoped.  Be proud Ren,  be proud
Amazing 😮 masterful storytelling 😮 acting and Sam 🔝 that was great.
Compact and masterful; thank you so much Ren!
The producction of the video and the music turns in one and every detail make me feel amazed, at the third time i wacthed almost cry its indiscribible but is just amazing
I N C R E D I B L E
This is a masterpiece!!!
Wauw❤️‍🔥
Exceptional 👏👏👏
Fuck….
Luigi
Truth <3
This man is telling us all an important truth that I think we all feel to a greater or lesser extent- The world we live in as humans has been fucked for a long time and we have the collective power to remedy all the wrongs that infect our societes, but we don't. Because when there's something in it for YOU then it's nearly always worth it, especially if there's money involved. 🤑  So remember to take the opportunity to help others over yourself and fight for the injustices of a stranger, family, colleague or neighbour.  Put the desire for material gain aside and invest in your fellow man and as a bonus you should find a lot more joy sprout from within yourself as a result. 😊
Algorithm show the world rens masterpiece
That one struck me to the core.
Ever since I've discovered Ren about a month ago, I feel the inspiration and courage to go forth with my artistic ideas I've been piling up on the shelf for years thinking they were too “out of place”. But “Hi Ren”, “Sick Boi”, and “Money Game” made me realize that the only limit to the creativity is the one we create ourselves in our minds.  Ren and Ronnie Radke have reinvigorated my passion for creating music the way I always wanted it to be – raw, emotional, and honest to the world and to myself. That's for the third time when an artist does that to me. Thank you so much for showing up in my life, mate. It means a world to me.
puhhh... we just witnessed how Ren created a masterpiece... I'm speechless... ❤
Absolutely phenomenal
Netflix needs to sign you up to produce a thriller series! So bloody talented, big future ahead ❤👏
Genius. Love it. On repeat all damn day.
Pwoah, knocked it out the park yet again, absolutely incredible!
Insane level of work has gone into this my man, an absolutely amazing breakdown of just how fucked we are as a society currently.
Absolutely amazing poetry, not as listenable as #2 but your words are more important
Well well you just had to go and make opus out of this now trilogy of spittin' the truth. I tip my imaginary hat to you good sir.
✌️👍
Amazing video. However we gotta work on that trigger discipline 😬
That’s a fucking masterpiece
Ren is absolutely right when he says this is not entertainment, it is far beyond that. More than just a statement or a warning, even if it fits every single one of those labels, this is pure art, the kind that people will look back on and remember for decades, centuries to come, if they open their eyes to see it.
As a marxist and an activist this song has inspired me more than words can say. I hope we never lose our revolutionary optimism. May we have justice for the victims of capitalism someday.
Wow.  We're all in it, The Money Game
The video dropped less than an hour ago and I have just watched Money Game 3 three times as well as reactions by Knox Hill and Fishtank.  I am Blown Away by this MASTERPIECE.  I have SO MUCH RESPECT and ADMIRATION for you, REN, and for SAMUEL, and for EVERYONE who came on board to produce the EXCELLENCE of Money Game 3.  It is TRUTH. I am hoping the Entire WORLD will see this and receive this MESSAGE.  Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU, REN. This is truly a GENIUS WORK OF ART AND A GIFT OF GREAT INSIGHT.  Thank you so much  💜
FUCKING WHAT THIS IS UNLIKE ANYTHING I HAVE HEARD AND YOU HAVE MADE BEFORE, W O W
No words. Just great.
I..... FUCKING..... LOVE YOU!!!!!
Love all of your One-Take masterpieces. This is AMAZING!
The last Bit tho🤌 Absolute CHILLS
absolutely love it
One of your best pieces of art yet in my opinion.  Thank you so much for your work and your authenticity!
Amazing
I feel like i shouldn't be feeling this. But i am and this is sad. You did an outstanding job there, Mr. Gill. I thank you very much.
I'm just speechless man.
So damn cool!
Nice variation on the theme. Someone grew up with Vivaldi.
Let's Welcome Ren...A.K.A...Jack Da Rippa...The Jack of all trades....to (The Money Game)
Just Wow. You shine bright Ren and your music lights me up. Another amazing song ❤ Big loves x
Just found your music and fell in love with it, and now we got this...

GARBAGE!!!!! His worst ever he’s noW RICH telling others that the rich are bad haha TRASH
All I can say is WOW!!   Ren this is unbelievably brilliant. It’s absolute perfection and then some xx
Is it just me or am I going crazy Ren videos are some of the best being produced these days. One after another and everyone of them are better and better.
So right and true😮
All Wars are Bankers' Wars
Fun fact, the only thing keeping us from a utopia is ourselves.
This is really a masterpiece in stortelling. The lyrics, visuals, the relevance that it has right now in our egocentric society- just wow....Ren. A  fruit of hardwork, passion and talent!
Nice, very nice, thanks mate
Algorithim comment.
You are a very impressive person. Just... wow
👑REN
Damn..that was.. crazy. No words
Wow wow wow.. Absolutely amazing!
Ren…absolutely a masterpiece. The vision and the story and how it all ties together is amazing. Great job, please enjoy your success and keep bringing music to those that want to hear it!!!
Ren, what a beautiful creative you are in this world. A true artist.. 🙏
Damn
Ren is indescribably talented, insightful, wordsmith,musician and the artist for our time.   Spectacular 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
a... a have no fcking words, art, art is the definition of this video
You never disappoint. MASTRPIECE!
DAMN !!!!!! A deep, thought provoking MASTERPIECE  !!!!!! GENNIOUS !!!!
Wow, Mephistopheles   vibes. That was awsome, yeah...just awsome 🎉❤
He done did it again! Was there ever any doubt though, really?
Ren is a brilliant storyteller
Such a talented guy ❤
Incredible 👏 👏 👏
Hi Ren was his Godfather.   THIS is his Godfather Part 2.  That was the most sublime cinematic, enrapturing, art house, operatic shout to the heavens.  Bravo Sir!!  Now I can’t wait to watch online reactions and bring on the conversation!
Oh freaking BRAVO! That was so damn impressive!
This isn’t only a song..this is art and the storytelling just..masterpiece
I preordered the album, first physical album I've bought in years. Aside from 1-2 songs he hasn't released as singles, this album is a passionate and personal art piece, and I'm more than happy to support the greatest independent artist alive. Cheers Ren on this accomplishment, I can't wait to see the heights your talent and dedication will take you!
Our REN-aissance Man newest masterpiece, I love your storytelling songs Bro!
It's Rens world and were just living in it 😘👌
Just caught a bit of what u where saying on twitch m8 and totally agree with u m8 such a compassionate and honest view on the way we could implement change and help humanity take care bro ❤
So impressive!  But nowhere with a feeling of the purpose to impress.  Only mesmerizing in the whole concept and performance!  Best wishes to yours and everys soul Paul
10/10 camera work. Ren you’re murdering beats
How can someone continually deliver better and better content, more thoughtful, more pensive, musical depth deeper, message more poignant. Fuck. Definitely got some Muse vibes in here as well.
Dang … Just dang…  💚
Congrats, Ren.
Fuck! Chills everytime
Once again Ren takes the cake with his music, bravo! The videography is outstanding, the way the camera follows him, how everyone is following his orders and the flow of the video, it truly has the same vibes as the first part with using the people as a hostage, and yet in the end Ren is also a hostage. Good job Sam and Ren, always look forward to everything you guys make :)
Rare talent, thanks for this chef d'oeuvre !
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🤯🤜🤛❤️ Australia mate
Just incredible.  I have been on such a roller coaster ride today.. felt all of the feelings. Like the sun rising in the east and settling on the ocean floor, its a day spent with purpose and shared with a beautiful community. Just love for you Ren
when the musician leaves and the artist arise
What an absolute Masterpiece
That was amazing. I’m so glad I pre-ordered the new album
❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩😈😈😈😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫🫨🫨🫨🤗🤗🤗
Bravo!
I LOVE Money Game Part 1 because of its message, the melody and especially because of the chorus, which really kicks in when you listen to it on headphones. Of course, I also love Part 2 for the same reasons. I was extremely excited and full of anticipation when I heard that Ren was working on Part 3 and could hardly wait, but at the same time I was a bit afraid and doubted whether he hadn't already ridden the horse to death and whether the same song wouldn't work a third time, because I expected the same melody or at least the same chorus as in the first two parts. Now when I listened to the 3rd part for the first time, I was at first confused and disappointed that it is not the beloved melody/refrain, but only to be surprised right back - and as always - by Ren with a great performance and story. A new masterpiece from an artistic genius! It's just a pity that it's not for the radio and thus remains hidden from the masses and can't unfold its full effect! Love you Ren! 🫶🏻
Holy shit goosebumps all the way till the end!❤
Great story teling, never stop to amase. 45 ears old, but on the oposite side . Thanks for you music
His Netflix show will be brilliant.
REN....you will never ever be anything but an awesome man, writer, actor, composurer, just 🔥!! So talented, never just a song....all my 💗 you are amazing sir!!🔥🔥🔥
I don't know how you do Ren, every song a journey, a story to be told, so glad I can be here to see it unfold.
Well done Sam and Ren!
Great art❤
wow, this is a masterpiece ❤
This is a masterpiece
Genius story telling mate.  Amazing cinematography by Sam and the team too. Good luck on the album release.
That’s right 💯
I wonder if he could write another "Hamilton"
This is a masterpiece
Another face of money games. This time how it affects ones life. Its a powerful song.
Once more you left me speechless and I felt like it was too short! Bravo👏 👏👏
Ren should be top of the list for the next Bond Theme.
Yes yes yes! 🎉🎉🎉
Absolutely exceptional in every way! I agree. A masterpiece! Money Game 1, 2, and 3 should be taught in every school in the world, beginning at a young age through PhD level. ❤
Man.   "44 - inside a palace with a mountain of gold but those riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves." *Chefs kiss* what a line.
I can’t even lie saw this guy on tiktok like an hour ago and he’s already in my top 3 artists
Very deep, amazing art, can’t wait for the album to arrive ❤
That was a great story!
HOLY SHIT The chills I got on the last sentance, you never stop to surprise Ren.
Quality again! And the Filming is now on the same level!
Masterpiece!!!!!! World must see it
Wow, you just keep getting better and better Ren!
How is the mainstream media going to spin this one ?
Thank you Ren - you're a wake up call this world needs. Your art is getting a much needed message across. Much respect from an old man who has one foot in the grave.
Holy shit. Just wow. What a masterpiece in storytelling and insight.
this might be tied for first place as my favorite song by you along with "Hi Ren"
I don't know how he is constantly putting out masteeoices, but he's done it again.  Thanks for all the hard work you guys put into this.  Can't imagine how complicated it was to pull it all off in a one take.
Im speechless. This is an absolute masterpiece!
Oh, wow!! Wow, wow!! So worth the wait!
Brilliant! 🙌🙌🙌
God damn prolly first time a songs hit like this
A brilliant and powerful third installment. Everything is elevated. Keep making art, Ren!

Just amazing, commenting for the algorithm, nothing more to say, it’s a masterpiece
Ren you released this today…. My 45th birthday!
Legendary
Just amazing genius
Dude on here looking like tommy Shelby. If Ren can stay healthy he'll take over the world just like a peaky blinder.
This is one of the coolest music videos AND songs I've seen, all in one. This is too good.
Wow wow wow, totally stunned Ren. This folks, is what you call a masterpiece ❤
Wow meraviglioso!
Outstanding Raw Talent, This is Consciousness/God writing and performing, right here.
Genius level musician almost like a Mozart of sorts mixed with high levels of creativity and insanity to make this art
The message so clear there is plenty for everyone they just want it all for themselves
Luigi raps about Jimmy
sell those shells ren
Masterpiece! Thanks!
It was worth the wait, Ren.  Incredible.  All your hard work paid off with this one.  Your legend continues to grow.
Ren...      You remind me that as an artist I have an obligation to speak up and use my talents for good. Thank you for being you and sparking this fire within me- within us all. This is the beginning of a new era... The  21st century RENaissance. Grateful to be alive to witness it... and hopefully become a part of it. You absolutely inspire me.  Within love,adoration,respect and gratitude...                                 Vixen
WHEN THE VIOLIN 6:25 KICKED IN I HAD CHILLS ALL IN MY BACK
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
wow! wow! brilliant ty
Awesome
Fire
He’s done it again. Brilliant bit of music and theatrics.
its not often im left speechless by a song, but this isn't a song. Its art. This is a masterstroke of writing
wow
Thank you!!!! Ren! That's brilliant!!   Story telling, Camera..... i'm speechless ❤🔥🔥🔥
Wow...just when I think Ren can't prove he's any more talented than he already is and he releases something like this...I'm speechless...
We get it.... you're an alien.
WOW another banger. Rens talent is unmatched xx
Genius! 👏👏👏
That was amazing, thank you Ren for all of the amazing work you’ve done and will continue to do. You truly are an inspiration,
Maybe you’re right, maybe it’s Ren!  Jesus fuck! Well that was worth the wait. Here’s me sat here feeling like I’ve had a great evening. Brilliant treasure hunt with the shells hidden on an island then this epic story.  I haven’t even got around the the reactors yet and I’m already made up.
This shit rips
EVERY TIME🫡
Couldn't have said it better myself. 😂 U r an AMAZIN', creative Human bein.  ❤ Ren ur shinin' a light x 🙏 God bless you x
Reminds me a little of the style.of guy Ritchies camera work, very very good
wow, hooked from start to finish 🙌🙌
wait that was 9 minutes ? I mean, I saw the length at the beginning of the video, and it made me happy because I was like "hey, gonna be a long song from one of my favorite artists !" but damn... was it really 9 minutes ? Not two ? Not three ? Fucking hell, I was mesmerized.
That ending made me flinch. Incredible song, defiantly worth the wait.
This is so fucking great
Suicide doesn't end the hell it continues it..  Materialistic world built by satan and his puppets ..  Faith from within comes from the creator..pure love is everywhere if people make the right decision each day.. responsibility for oneself and not reliant on a government who destroy you or people who let you down..   Greed, the biggest evil of them all ..next to a liar.. which most are..   No integrity,  humility,  honour,  faith, respect..
Absolutely lost for words with this one!!! Such a masterpiece, thank you Ren. Appreciate your heroes while they’re still here.
This dude is something else all together. Its not the kind if music you put on your Spotify playlists. Its an experience, rhat you havevto see and hear, but especially feel. Not all his songs are like that and some are on my playlist. But with this one, you need to see the video too. Masterpiece and he keeps surprising me. Not just the fact that he sings, raps, write his own music,he also plays guitar and piano,it seems. Thanks Sinead O'Connor, if it wasn't for her tweet, I woildnt even know who Ren was and through him another favorite of mine; Chinchilla. King & queen of England, when it comes to these 2 artists!!❤💟💝💟❤
Outstanding performance
Goosebumps all over. You are able to convey messages with your music in a way that few can. It's a work of art and a work of passion. Thank you Ren
Speechless!!!❤
Tsunami !! Bloooommmm!
Very powerful, now does anybody have spare change?
Wow. Ren & Sam! Amazing piece of work! Ren, you are a true artist. This is artistry of a craft at its very best.
this is a whole damn movie wtf
Love from Melbourne Australia 👽👽👽👽♥️🇦🇺 Australia
Mister Ren... this is amazing, thank you, for you, and your team's work on all these videos and music. It's truly astounding how deep the message is.  Indeed the messages behind your work are philosophical and deep. Truly enjoyable for the mind's eye and the meek. Thank you truly to the many of those influencing us all, your work goes not unnoticed even when, if rarely, maybe flawed in some small sense as we are only human and our work is typically imperfect - we all work as we can with the tools we have to create an environment of growth in hand with our reality deep inside our societies we try to make better for us all. Lyrically, I'm insignificant but inspired by your faculties I am attempting to express a heartfelt and gentle hand extending toward you and the many others involved in giving us an astounding sense of what it means to bear a burden deep inside but to shine the light upon it that which needs to be improved, and ever endearing human mood
Yes mate.
Another one !!! WoW you are going too deeeeeeeeeeep man ! Credits to the videographer too! Flawless job! Greetings from Greece!
This man is a lyrical genius!!!
Just brilliant Ren what a performance 🎉 18k views get ready for the millions.

👏🙂
Holy shit man!! 🤯
Never forget bee freee keep the old school rules ..hope ure good 🍻
This is absolutely incredible! Found Ren's music by complete chance about a month ago and am profoundly happy I did. I've never heard anything that sounds like this. Just absolutely stunned. Fan for life!
Perfection
I’ve never clicked a video so quick In my entire life this is absolutely astonishing, keep up the amazing work ren I honestly can’t wait to see what you drop next ❤
And ok I'll say it... Ren in a suit!🥵🔥
Holy crap, just got back into listening to Ren after loving the old money game and screech takes etc, can't believe he's done another one can't wait to see what else he has in store he's come such a long way I'd definitely love to see him perform live.❤
Boom
Ren is raising the bar in music , my before golden song turns into sand. I get annoyed when friends wont give this music a chance and try to understand.
Too good for words
This is pure art ❤
My jaw was on the floor the entire time. Amazing.
Ren told the story of an modern tradegy  P.s youre like a child of lucifer and tommy shelby ngl
I didn't think you could out "hi ren", "Hi Ren" but you managed it.....Congrats on another banger😊
Lars von trier vibes on that video... Top drawer yet again

Thank you for this. Top shelf work all around. I went to the liquor store to grab some beer the other day, and I heard Love Music part 4 playing. I excitedly asked the clerk, "where is that music coming from? There's no way you're playing Ren"" and then realized it was coming from my pocket, somehow play got pressed while getting out of the car. I went on a quick rant of how good your music is & how your 1st hip hop album was coming out this week. He said to let him know who it was so they can play it for me. Cheers!
Just Wow
I was waiting the “finger of a money game” very good 👍 🎉
You call him Jimmy, I call him Hunter😂
I just cloked my condoliis 🖤🍻
I don’t think I’ve ever been so captivated in my life.
part 3?!? holy shit, your never stop amazing me, ren   holy shit just listened to it, this gave me chills down my spine
<3
So good.
YOOOOOOOOOO FINALLY
Amazing!! Genius!!
Loved without even hearing.  U r a masterpiece
Leaving a comment for the algorithm. The piano part was everything 🙂.
Joder Ren, joder 🖤🤯
Holy shiiiiiit 😭
Ren, Ren, Ren.... just amazing stuff man.
I'll tell you what the shame is, no singing or melody, just storytelling in the same style and tone, its all Ren seems to do, rap and and more rap.  Seems like this one was rushed.
You are the Goat Ren!
I just so pleased I never heard the pop of The gun
❤❤❤❤
After I've watched the video, I'm crying. Truth is being spoken that no one will hear, and even if they do, the algorithm will tell them suicide is normal. We all need to be there to help everyone, regardless! You could be hood, or a preacher or an average bloke. Like without help is an absolute joke.
FTA
Another work of art. You've done it yet again Ren, obviously. Goosebumps from the beginning to the end. Absolutely love it!!❤
I don‘t know how you do it ,but you impress me more with ervery song.And this one‘s truly a work of art
the amount of talent this guy yields is rediculous. I almost wish he made stereotypical music so I could listen in my car but I ain't complaining this is art.
communism
You never fail to impress mate. Insanely talented and inspiring!
WOW
Psychopathy and generation genius are smelted here maestro
Amazing as always.
This is truly a masterpiece. I started listening to Ren of his original style and amesing writing skills. This is fire!
wew! been a while since ive heard something that hit this different.
Art!❤
Great work. Also big shout out to your video crew… really amazing moves and fantastic aesthetics.
The variety of musical styles Ren excels at is truly amazing. Keep it up, my guy. 🍋
Bravo 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 Brilliant no other words Kids a genius. Thanks Ren.
Hahah.. video ends and I get a commercial from the lottery 😂😢
Masterpiece ❤
Brilliant! Your best work to date.
A fine example of why we HAVE to protect our freedom of speech.  Thank you Ren. Another outstanding piece of poetry/Music that we can all relate too in some way shape or form.
Amazing Ren 💯💚
Pure art 🖤 🔥
J'adore cet artiste, bravo
Love from ROM and Bri i can tell by her reaction she really loves this one RESPECT musical madness
Brilliant just brilliant work ✌
What a saga! Epic. You awoke the dormant poet within me. I was without luminosity in those last years. I used to write a lot, my heart burning with fire to illuminate my path, but after the pain of facing the harsh realities of life, my fire, it dwindled...  I was truly entranced by the matrix, and that's fine. But watching you write ✍️ and infuse our hearts with an abundance of beauty while simultaneously denouncing humanity's core issues has stirred something within me.  Thank you, Ren. You are the mirror of hope I've always sought in mankind.   Keep doing what you doing 🙏🏽
The choreography is amazing. All done in one camera. Very clean and very clever background and characters. You’re an amazing performer and artist!! 🎉 🍋
I just want to watch it again and again!
=)
Bravo
This is amazing. Just... wow.  The message couldn't be more clear. Truly a masterpiece.
This played like a suspense movie! On the edge of my seat the whole time. Bravo Ren, Sam and the crew! Another masterpiece! ❤❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥
Babe, wake up, Ren just dropped money game part 3
A comment so the algorithm can be pushed a little more to help spread this  Looking forward to the album
I could say a lot but I am just going to say WOW!!
Self loathing your success?
Well fuck me in the beard, you've done it YET AGAIN
Fuck
Wow wow wow 😮
😯
Damn this is absolutely incredible
Another piece of art. Great intensity and depth, thought-provoking! Keep up the good work my man. Wishing you all the best for your life. God bless!
We are like minded Ren, i know it now, thanks for this, i feel less alone now knowing some1 else thinks of these things too. Stay healthy.🤗
❤
You really have an incredible mind Ren. Everything flows so well the story, the visual choices, the lyrics. Just phenomenal! ❤ 18 thousand views so far and 15 thousand of them liked the video! That's pretty amazing
Holy shit Ren, you really pushed the envelope this time.  I love it, but be prepared for he backlash. 👍👍
Just wow.
As always, what a masterpiece!
❤❤❤
omg the voice at the start beautuful i love your music and the "then he presses on the of a money game" i had chills down my skull and in the roots of my hair that is truely a beautuful song
The father likes kinda hit different mate. U truly are a master of ur craft
Incredible. Bravo sir.
dudeeee i have no words TRUTH IS LESS IMPORTANT THAN ME MONEY THAT WE DESING thats just wild talking
WOW WOW WOW! You've changed the game young man! Masterpiece! Can't wait for the trio CD set to turn up in the post! 😍👌🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow. Kids in three hundred years time are going to hate him when they have to learn Renspeare in school.
For me you are a genius and i thank you for your art, and your poetry
Wow. That was a classical masterpiece with a sad story. The suit reminds me of the album cover of "Encore" from Eminem. Or Agent 47 from Hitman. And the ending of the song gives me some "When I'm gone" vibes. This is a great way to end a trilogy.
I fucking love this
<3<3<3😎
I wrote a full post on all of my socials tonight after this video premiere and this bit of a long post seemed apt to post here. 🙂 Every track carries a message. A lesson. A Significant truth.  Ren is the embodiment of anticipation and is the most exceptional artist that I have bared witness to in a very long time. Every song is a story, every story is a visually artistic cinematic experience alongside emotional and raw acoustic no strings renditions and it’s not enough simply to just tell you about Ren and his world – you need to really step inside and set your egos aside to see what the hell I am talking about.
As amazing as always… Love you man. I’d never imagined hearing my country’s name( Iran ) in a Ren’s song 😂
Next level genius 😎
Mad good!
Fuckin' hell Ren.
Fucking.....amazing ❤❤❤
Loved Every Single Second of It Ren! Amazing!!
👏👏👏  Amazing 👍👍
I have said it at other Ren pieces: Better than anything Hollywood & Co. have put out in the recent years! How can it be that a kinda low budget production can deliver an emotional story that connects us with the character as well as our own humanity in the process in deeper ways than all the big players in the (money) game. Rhetorical question. Thank you Ren, Sam and all involved for all the love and passion you put in this piece of art (in the most radical and relevant meaning of the word). I wish you all the best!!!
Your lyrical masterpiece gave me the chills…
poetic genius.
Yoo
I am speechless! Just wow! Finally someone dares to tell the truth. Thank you Ren ☮
🔥🔥🔥A MASTERPIECE🔥🔥🔥
This is epic!!!!!!!!
Wow. Such a story teller. And your messages! Thank you Ren. ❤❤❤
W.O.W.!!!!
Wonderful and extremely cool video.  Thank you!
I love that it's only been up for an hour and had 18k views.   Been hanging for this Ren!
Ren is amazing.
Prelude or intro to money game 1 and 2? Sure. But where's the driving acoustic guitar,  that catchy hard hitting choruses? I was worried you were gonna love music 4 this track... sad I was right. I like it but it's NOT money game. 😢
The fact he always has stories for his music shows how creative ren is and I love every song he makes
love you boi, thanks for all emotional brutality
My god man. This is good.
you are a legend <333
Brilliant
Never ever disappoints Ren. Genius at its best!
Mind Blown.
Blown away
Absolutely astounding! A Masterpiece!
Sick ,Honest,Real, Truth, it's such a shame me me 🤘🏻👊🏻
Brecht would fucking love this. That is all.
Been waiting for this one.  Superb!
holy s***. If Ren doesn't get a Grammy...or all of them there is no justice (I don't think he does it for the awards, but GODDAM!!)
Fan-dooly-tasic
Man you did it again, at first set yourself on fire, and now a bullit in your brain.  A truely strong message  which I highly admire the world´s selfdestructive money game is making us all feeling dire.
Awesome story telling and fantastic video work from Sam can't wait for part 4 😊
Hi Ren I have fuking lyme disease and covid and I so tireddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd!
Amazing!✌🏻🫶🏻
Yes. Diolch. 💐
Well done, guys. Ren & Sam = masterpiece! 👌❤
Ren, please keep up what your doing, you are one of the most incredible artists ive found in my 28 yesrs of living. Not only me but my whole friend group adore you. You remind me of myself in your music , it makes me want to better myself and seek the goals i want but dont actively try attempt to achieve. Your poetry and personality spark a fire beneath me🎉...keep it up brother your doing something special for the globe
Always hope your good lad Blackpool lad🍻
Extraordinary.....definitely a brightness in this world
Comment for the algorithm
Ren, I don't even know what to say.  WoW!!! ❤
Honest.  Hopeful.  ❤
That ending, CHILLS.
That was an amazing piece of art❤
Wow I can’t believe I was lucky to stumble on you last night!
😢
g e n i u s
I am in AWE, chills, goosebumps, a roller coaster of anticipation and excitement.   On a side note, Ren is wearing the fuck out of that suit 😍🔥
MADAFACKAR excellent as asways
Replay, replay, replay etc .... 💚
I feel truly inspired and blessed to have been following you for several years. Watching you busking back in the day, I knew you had a depth to your performances that I had not yet fully seen. I am glad that I continue to be a part of this community. Watching you grow and touch more people with these messages and  thought provoking concepts brings tears to my eyes. For you and your journey you have gone through and continue on. And for  humanities journey, mother nature, the universe. I have aways believed that this was exactly what being an artist, of any sort , is about.   Thank you Ren. I believe in us.
Slick Rick is looking nervous right now!
less go
Amazing
just amazing
Oh, qhit, that's 9 MN ? (Spacial distortion happened) Note please, please, for foreigners like me, the lyrics were very useful, I don't need them any more but plenty of others do. Thanks for them. Thank you.
Damn. I can’t stop watching this masterpiece. Just like I couldn’t stop watching Oppenheimer one and kept sneaking out to the movies week after week.  Same level mind blowing effect on me. Damn.
ART
Genius. Brilliant. Now it's time for us all to unite around LOVE & Ren. The dickheads in power are gonna fuck it all up. If they can't have it all you know what they will do? destroy everything, so let's listen to Ren. It's time everybody, are we mice or men? Let's follow his example and remember the Pen! Cos the pen is mightier than the sword, mixed together with his genius we are an unstoppable force. Love you my Brother and thanks once again
Fucking brilliant ❤
Been waiting for this one for a long time You went above all expectations with this!
one of the best music videos I've ever seen beautifully written lines  maybe the most epic instrumental you've ever used goosebumps after finishing the video  ren, you have created another masterpiece and I am really thankful that I and so many others are here for it. you are an incredible artist and a huge inspiration. much love <3
Absolutely stunning 😮
You now deserve time off to focus on you and your treatment.
You said this was your most ambitious piece yet. You were right and your hard work shows. It’s sooooo much more than a music video. I’m going to have to watch it over and over to catch everything. You did it!
Holy fuck! This was absolutely brilliant ❤❤❤
siiiiick
Masterpiece is an understatement.
Leaving a comment before watching and listening because I know this will be 10/10 fire
Amazing song, but it doesn't feel like Part 3 of Money Game. Money Game Part 2 was evolution of original Money Game. Part 3 feels/sounds very different from other 2.
Absolutely incredible!
Ah fuck sake,, he's done it again ,, seriously how does he keep doing this,, amazing song, amazing video, amazing delivery, amazing message. Who else is doing this nowadays? And Ren has been doing it for years ,so glad the world has caught up with his talent I've been listening for years and will keep listening.
😢 every time. Brilliant!
You sir… pack a powerful punch. Stunning… concept and execution!!!  This was powerful.
Incredible. Thank you so much for your music
this is nerve, it's great,  pure art
The following grows.  Another masterpiece.
Great video to this track🔥🔥🔥🔥👍👍👍👍😎😎😎😎
Anyone catch the beautiful violets tale motif when looking in the mirror ❤
Woah  Wow  WOW!!!!
Wow! Totally gripping, art, another masterpiece.
Love it!  Thank you for another banger
That's fucking beautiful, i had huge expectations knowing who this is coming from but not THIS high. The amount of little details and twists and how creative and cold the clip was, it all fits together so perfectly.
Brilliant
I just watched an entire movie in 9 minutes and 19 seconds. This guy is a class above all.
Fantastically performed! Story, music, lyrics, acting, set and photography are immaculate! Will re-watch this many times. But now we have all 3 parts 🙂 And yes, of course the album set is on pre-order!
Fucking brilliant!
Dang dude.  I guess you have what it takes to follow it up.  And.....then.....judging by this....that acting career just hangs there in the background....
almost has as many likes as views thats nuts
I'm an idiot. I was like "this release was hyped up so much, it can't possibly deliver". I sat down, watched, and was amazed at the writing, camerawork, design, but I was like" we have heard Ren do these to absolute perfection before" and then it just went on and I wasn't even aware when it really pulled me out of those thoughts and into the story and it blew me away. I didn't think the hype can be met. I stand corrected. There might come a day when a new Ren release will not topple the one before it, but this is not that day...
god damn.
Fucking amazing
Like @KnoxHill said, Masterpiece.  Ren you're such an amazing story teller.
what a song. what a trilogy. WHAT A LEGEND.  The video clip slaps as well. The waiting was well worth it !
18k in a hour, yessss Ren This is a masterpiece, love it:")
I love what you do! And I appreciate why you do it. ❤
Another absolute masterpiece.
All I can say is... Damn..
Genisus
Love this!
The social commentary is awesome
Truly a masterpiece! This was so intense and a great culmination of the whole money game series so far(part 4 coming???) congrats Ren can’t wait for your interview with Knox!
Amazing. You never cease to amaze and astound me. Well done sir. Well done.
Ren = modern day Shakepsear ...  deep on soo many levels many will never even notice ...
so damn good
Superb, we'll worth the wait
excuse me what..NINE MINUTES? *NINE MINUTES!* You madlad
The world has shown such things to someone so young and you have the gift to put it into words for us to understand. You are making waves in the world.
Genius
sending much love from the south of the UK  <3
Everytime I think Ren hit the top, he created a masterpiece, something that he can't possibly exceed my expectations again... he does it again. This is no exception to that rule. Truly a masterpiece, well done. I look forward to getting proven wrong again and again.  Thank you Ren.
Bravo!!!!! The RENaissance strikes again with another glorious masterpiece!  🙌🙌
Ren is brilliant - he’s saying what a lot of us have been thinking for a long time.   Some, a lifetime. While we self-manage our retirement accounts avoiding broker greed all the while thinking “man I hope this works out”.   Rain, rain, rain … a storm it comes our way.   Buy crypto, buy gold. Buy renewable energy if you’re very bold.  Then turn on the game, and have yourself a beer. Man there’s nothing dangerous happening here.  Meanwhile my Canada is not the only country on literal fire every summer, we are on the edge of multiple useless wars and global catastrophe.   The solution?  Stop hating people you don’t even know, stop picking sides, learn to actually listen.   Stop letting algorithms piss you off so much that you can’t do that. They do it on purpose.  Stop thinking “me” and start thinking us.   Maybe, just maybe…   if we are very very lucky, we could all lose the money game …
This is great story telling
fucking amazing!!!!
That's amazing. Wow.
When the vocals started I ran to my light switch because I just had to have the right ambience to experience this
😮❤
This is what I need in 3 Am ,absolutely stunning
Masterpiece! Is the "We can builds Utopias if individuals are taught to use there’s brains" line supposed to be a reference to Engels's "Socialism: Utopian and Scientific"? You're the best Ren 10 minutes went by in a second!
.
Pre-ordered cd and vinyl as soon as they were available. Also bought the new t-shirt 😺 Totally worth the hype! 🤑 Also Respect to everyone involved in this work of art : Another Samuel and Ren masterpiece ❤
Money game
Legendary stuff from a true artist with depth ... thx Ren
Wonderful piece of work. Never cease to amaze.
No one was expecting that. Amazing and unique.
You are a genius, sir, and a REAL ARTIST...
WOW just WOW 😄 amazing I introduced your music to my brother recently 😊 Your music always hits the hard stuff and gives me chills, you have an amazing way with words.
This is one of the best pieces of art i have had the fortune of consuming. Its like Immortal Instruments meats Second Thought (a yt channel)
WOW
this is cinema
Art! Pure art! Thank you 🙏 Ren
I dig it. You have a lot to say and you say it so so well. Please stay safe because you're an inspiration to us all to get up and do what we can to CHANGE this fucking thing.
Not Music. Not a musician. Not an artist. Something else, something bigger and better.
Lost for words! 👏
<blank comment> take a break man and enjoy life before you can't go anywhere anymore. nice. Wish you peace and love always man.
I had chills watching this. Ren, you blow peoples minds and force them to think. I love your music and your message!
Outstanding, now you can't top that,but just wait, Ren will show you MG12 .
Absolutley gorgeous. Dont ever stop Ren!
Dude…. you are an ARTIST of the highest caliber. I hope you make a film, series or musical theater production someday. This is brilliant. And the camera work! Sam is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 It’s been so nice to have a Thursday Ren premiere day again! Thank you for all the joy you bring to us. Truly. You deserve every bit of success you’ve earned. Also…… Ren in a suit is more than I can handle 😅
💜absolutely amazing💜
@jordanbpeterson Is this deep enough to finally do a @Renmakesmusic interview?
Ren you are our guide who will lead us to the truth. I love you so much. keep writing for us, I live for it
I'm stunned, this is so good.💕
Magnificent,  fenomenal,  wise or me, it gonna be the one of those that becoming deeper in meaning with each listening.  I  have a question? Where was the mum of Jimmy to balance the ambitious upbringing of dad? The moral is that you always  lose yourself trying to fulfil others' expectations .Love, trust, and community are real living connecting powers .
Wow! Just wow! I'm speechless. What a masterpiece,
Freaking WOW!
Smashed it 😊
This transcends music, there are no words to express just how much of an artist you are.
Wow! Como siempre, Obra Maestra.
❤😔❤ So true. so sad ... of the planet, all creatures great and small and it's HUMANITY... Thank you REN, (& Co.), for doing it justice with your interpretation, soulful and banging music, dedication and truth/story telling XXX. Its up to all of us to make the change...can't eat $$$$
Amazing work. All I know is I’m lucky to say I’m alive during the time of Ren. That’s a blessing in disguise. 😉
You spoil us with good music choice Ren.
Amazing.  Original. Thought provoking.   Important.    Thanks Ren.
You are truly the best . Keep doing you and don’t stop
Ren - Just Wow,! You are a F**king Genius and please don't ever forget that! Thank you for being you, for sharing your talent, thoughts and ideologies! You Sir enrich my life (and without being presumptuous) many other peoples lives! Much Love Brother ❤
This had me in tears of joy because of the sheer beauty of true art and genius. I love you, Ren and Sam! ❤
This is absaloutly amazing, i love this
This is probably gonna go down as my all time favourite song
Damn
👏 👏👏 This is something everyone should see. I am so happy, greatful and blessed to be able to experience you and the amazing things your  mind brings to this world.  Thank you and keep up the good work m8 🔥
SOOOO GOOOD
Wow. Well done, everyone! 🙌
No one asked for my take but here goes. On its own, the song is great and the video phenomenal. As a third installment of the Money Game series, I was hoping for something at least a little closer to the first two.
Oh yeah 👍 badass ✊
Masterful storytelling in a genre of its own! Thank you! ❤
I have no words.... a masterpiece Ren thank you man❤️
I am so glad I discovered you and your music
Oh sweet jesus Ren..you’re brilliant in many many ways. Thank you for the opportunity to this experience
This has transcended just being music or a video, this is art and a cautionary tale that needs to be seen by the masses
Utterly Outstanding!
Summon this up in 1 word -   Genius
This is soooo good what a masterpiece your a genius 🔥🔥🙏🙏
Before I watch the video... I am very proud of you Ren! You've brought mental illness and depression and loneliness  into the forefront. People need an outlet. Thank you for providing one.
46 when I realised I'm living in The Matrix 🤯
EFFING BRILLIANT !
This is fire🔥
Belligerent ignorance rules this world. Ren, your music has helped me heal.
Ren has his own lane and no one else is in it
Brilliant, cutting, the BLEEDING EDGE, as always...
Thank you Ren. Fucking brilliant. Gives me hope that voices such as this are emerging.
WOW
amazing
How awesome is this!!!! Love it!
Wow!!!! Mind absolutely blown!!!
Ren, you have solidified your status as the most important artist today. This is just sensational.
Chills, man. Chills. ❤‍🔥
Profoundly accurate; poetic art.  The love of money is indeed the root of all evil. Be mindful & kind renegades. Life is precious and tomorrow isn't guaranteed  🕳🐇
Only what i can say is you are fcking dope. Thanks for ur music
One of your best.
Just makes me look even forward to my triple CD releasing tommorow, what a Performance Masterpiece, this is so much more than just a song, Amazing Ren Brother
Bro you should enter this to film festivals this deserves a bafta
I got this recommended to me after listening to part 2
Yet another outstanding production  Ren!
That was incredible like actual genius, your ability to tell such impactful story’s in your music surprises me every time. Taking part in the money game challenge the last week has been mad and so fun! GOAT x
Bravo!! 👏👏
Bravo! 👏👏👏
Fantastic!  So we'll done.
Incredible musical art and delivery but a master of song. You ARE blessed. Thank you! 🙏
I'm 45 now, damn...
It's aight.
Wow, that's one hell of a "plan séquence", super impressive, Bravo !
Van fuckintastic🔥
Genuinely suspenseful 😮 amazing work ren 🤩
Smashed that like! btw, Strings coming in @ age 40....so good.
I'm thankful for this.
Wow, Bois, that was incredible, and way heavy.   Stepping up to the plate and knocking them out of the park, one after another, on so many levels. Bangers, art, philosophy, wellness, and introspection.
She sells she shells on the sea shore......  "Man, you sound so pretentious  Ren, your music is so self-centred No one wants to hear another song about How much you hate yourself, trust me You should be so lucky, having me inside you to guide you Remind you to manage expectations Provide you perspective, that thing you neglected, I get it You wanna be a big deal, next Jimi Hendrix? Forget it"  Another good video, thanks Ren.
Great... Ren is one of the most important artists nowadays!
Amazing.. There are videos and then there’s Sam and Ren videos.. Can’t wait till the postman drops my album off tomorrow 😁
I think i love him
Incredible 👏🏻
❤
Wow. I had tears at the end.
Absolutely brilliant 💕👏xxx
Oh, planets! That was... there's no words on the lexicon...  🌻❤️
Props to the pianist u set the mood bro  Edit:Ayo the chello's are sick  And we get a message from REN at the end 10/10😌
Holy Shit man, bravo!   I felt that in my sole.
You are still there and still doing great job. Thank you again :3
I'm done. This shit is too real.
Genius 👌🏻
not bad.
Absolutely genius and eye opening ❤
Wow
It's genius! I have a little daughter, she's 7, almost 8, and every day I tell her "I love you" and "listen to your heart". "Don't worry if you make mistake, just learn from it." And "don't compare yourself to others. You are you." Once I was different. I expected so much from myself and from others. Still chasing something, running for something. I've learnt to ... soften (if I can use your words Ren) And to stop. And to pay attention to what's important: feelings, people, animals, nature. Because of and thanks to my daughter and my husband ❤ When I listen to you I feel like you can see in more dimensions
GENIUS! 👏👏👏👏
Wow ! Surprised by the piano ❤  Beautiful! The best !
This cuts to the bone ! Fucking beautiful big brain on this man !
WOOOW! I just love you Ren. What an inspiration of our generation ❤❤❤
Respect
I'm from France, my parents discovered you about 1 year ago and made me listen to your music, then I made my girlfriend listen to it, and we all love it. Your music helped me to go through tough times recently, and I wanna say thank you for that. It's such an awesome song here, keep going, sending some love from France.
Ren is different, in all the best ways
So proud of you Man 🖤❤️🎧
Keep this up mate, this is absolute gold.
❤❤❤ Wizardry Legends ❤❤❤
<3
Theatrical and story telling genius. Ren you never fail to amaze. Mind blowing one of a kind talent!
Everything about this was crazy good. Music and pictures blend perfectly
Truly incredible. I was so hyped for this one and you did not disappoint.
What a piece of art! Ethics and aesthetics together without fissures. Thank you!
Absolutely outstanding!! Pure brilliance!
omg wow
I’ve just realised; there’s no pig?!
Crazy piece, from a crazy artist!!!! Out done yourself again
Everything you do is Gold. Thank you
Brilliant, once again!
An other masterpiece, wow, Ren, this blew me away.  I lack words.
This is incredible, Ren. We need more people like you in the world. Thank you for sharing your art with us.
Would've called it Money Game fin(?)  Loved it, so theatrical, poetic and real as always from you brotha~  P.S. i recall the days when I saw you street performing in Brighton years back and then I found the band, and then your solo career... AND REMEMBER - that a grown person with big fantasy is merely a child that never died :)
LOVE IT!
Wow
The craziest fact about this... is that there's a f*cking mic on his jacket. Don't you bloody tell me...
This gave me chills to the bone mate. F*ck people who abuse the system for money, for power, for self interest. And to those who do: ''I hope your god can save you, As your devil leads the way''.
Another masterpiece! Congrats!
What a fucking genius.
Amazing.
F$$k!!! ❤❤❤
Genius🙌👏
🔥🔥🔥🔥💰💰💰
I havent been this excited and emotionally impacted by an, for me, new artist since i was a teenager, and now im pushing on 50. You are truly an artistic genius and im in awe of the things you create. And the music videos brings me back to the late 80's when i first watched MTV and the videos where a big part of the experience. Masterfull production and storytelling. I am truly greatful that i have found your music!
Fuck....Wow!
A mirror to the madness of myopic men and money 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Absolutely amazing!
One of a kind...
ooooh bayby
Left me speechless. Bravo, Ren!
Did anyone else feel that Rena initial singing sounded like like intro to violets tale before it transitioned to the money game hook?
Always impressed with the great lyrics and timely social commentary. Keep it up!
OMG Fookin Brilliant!
Deep
Wow absolutely amazing the story telling was great ❤❤
My life can be split into two distinctive parts - before I discovered Ren and after. Like BC and AD or AM/PM , my life will forever be difined by Before Ren and After Ren. Ren I hope you see this because I'm not joking. You have changed my life and you are truly a saint to me. All hail Saint Ren ❤
preach
Amazingly Powerful - I'm honestly not sure how I feel right now.
Genius bro. From the song and performance, to the setting, filming, anf use of the space. Genius.
masterpiece.
Good Stuff
This is modern poetry at its finest
I kind of like this. I kind of like this a lot
I am shook to my core.  This is a very important message that we all need to listen to, we all need to let this sink into our minds as it is the truth of our world. And we need to help other to hear this too.
You know.. I don't know how many takes these videos take, but I imagine it's not many. This is pure perfection. Album is an instabuy!
i first listened to jennys tale not long after it came out and i instantly fell in love with your music, theres just so much passion put into each of the songs you make and im so glad i stayed listening to your music ever since because i now get to witness this absolute masterpiece  cant wait for sick boi
The amount that’s gone into this is insane! Can’t wait to see what’s up for the future!
Dear lord! This is an absolute masterpiece!
I somehow came across part 1 and 2 earlier today and I got so lucky with the part 3 being released now.  It’s amazing I hope your message comes across more people. You’re doing a great job keep going
Wow.  Just wow.
Absolutely amazing where did the 9 mins go, you need a part 4 now 😊
This series is absolutely breathtakingly provocative. Mind blown, this completely exceeded my expectations. When you said "This isn't entertainment, this is real life." MAJOR KEY!!!
Inspirational.. I don’t know how you do it, but you do it. Masterpiece 🙏🏻
Got gossebumps!   Love the money games 😍😍
Estoy llorando, de emoción y de rabia.  ¡Bravo!!! Una vez más, gracias, eres arte❤
Oh you never disappoint. Good work! I love it.
I was just reading about hypersanity today, wow ❤
Yes
As ever, you never cease to amaze....so looking forward to my pre-order Sick Boi 🤗
Pure art
Tres bien😂
your messages, the visuals, the music.... this is all done so so well. thanks for sharing your talents!
Rain rain rain rain.....  (but your garden will grow hysterical historical - THANK YOU, Ren 🥹🙏🏼)
truly amazing
Is this Ren?
This was such an amazing song!! Mindblowing!! Love it Ren!! ❤
That's a real masterpiece Ren - congratulations.
I just need you to know that you are saving lives. And changing lives. And that we see you.
You havent even started singing yet and i love it ❤
Haven't had this many goose bumps since I drove my car into a lake
masterpiece! Thank you
F**kin hell matey..... Goddamn ! One of the greatest poets of our time. I, and many others, genuinely hope that the cathartic nature of your art helps to heal you and bring you the happiness and good health that you so deserve. Thank you and also to those that support and help you on your journey. = )
Absolute art in every song!
You've led us out of the cave and showed us the true nature of those shadows on the wall.
Impressive - as always.
That was an experience. I love it but it makes me feel uneasy.
Absolute masterpiece!
seems like you done money game 1 and 2 just to test the waters then you adapted the new music into part 3 which is pretty damn cool if you ask me
Epic and so underrated
Never cease to amaze! Such a talented writers and performer ! And the camera work is amazing too! Cant wait for me! Love your music ❤😊
that's art.
fuck
Ren i dont really know how to discribe my feelings about your music. Its actually ridiculous how eceptionally amazing the art of yours is. The depht of the lyrics you write and the way you present it to the world.... man i never felt this for music in my life. I listened to your songs probably more than a 1000 times now and i still get goosebums. Everytime tears pushing up. Man you´re truly a master at your craft. Bless you, ren. You are a gift to all of us. I wish that all of ur dreams come true. thanks...
Pretty good timing for this song as we see the greed starting another war. As I get older I understand humans as a collective,  less and less.
You are truly amazing
wtf man, wtf… how do you always manage to outdo yourself. Fucking brilliant piece of story telling and absolutely incredible videography.  I cannot wait to see what you do next, you’re such an incredible inspiration. Thank you for reinvigorating my passion for music.
Absolutely genius bro
Ive not even finished yet but fuck me this is gonna blow up. absolutely fucking mind blowing. Im fucking speechless
... damn ...
That quite frankly is the best music video I've seen
Curious. . Who is Jimmy?
I love this sad story. Thank you for this and all of your music
another MASTERPIECE
REN! I'm laughing but it's because this is SO AMAZING! Thank you for making one of my flare up days better. Your mind intrigues me.
Holy sh*t f*ck this song is beyond the explanation of curse words. Shivers. Chills. Ren and Samuel, this is just incredible.
Goosebumps. Absolutely powerful message 🙏🏼
Ren, watching your music, your visions and all around artistry come together to form such an incredible masterpiece has been an absolute honor.  To see the values I hold so close and have done my best to instill in my own children brought to light in such a captivating way for the world to see, is such a trip.  When you see the pain and struggle in the eyes of everyone you meet it is mind boggling to try and understand why there is still so much hatred, greed, disrespect, and utter disregard for our fellow human beings every which way you turn.    Enter Ren.  You come out of nowhere and create this brilliant work of art which speaks in a variety of tongues, lyrically, musically, visually, theatrically....you make what I see in this world visible and relate-able to I think absolutely anyone who sees, hears, feels.....experiences it.  I truly believe what you have created could be the beginning of a revolution, the kind of revolution this world needs if it has any chance of surviving.  Thank you Ren💜
I'm breaking site rules by wearing headphones and using my phone for this.  Will I get I  trouble? Yes. It is fucking worth? Fuck yes!
algorithm ayup
Gosh and to think I'm only at 23 🐼
what a masterpiece!
I like you! 😊
Thank you for never falling into tranquility. Never fails to resonate. Relieved to have found you, my therapy, reminding me of hope and inspiring the fucking world man! 🙌 Looking dapper too ✌️
oh boi
bloody brilliant, my brother
On the edge of my seat like a movie about to shock you ❤well done it’s absolute masterpiece 🥹
One of the best pieces of music I've ever heard
Wow ! A fucking bloody masterpiece !
I was afraid pt 3 was not gonna be able to live up to the expectations but... Wow. Just wow.
banger
the legend Ren does it again
This is a BPLUPA! A Breathtaking Powerful Lifechanging Unidentified Piece of Art. Glad to be alive to watch its birth!
THIS. IS. ART.
I LOVE how you point out Politics and Money were an IDEA created, by US... having logical conversations of change in the world about this can be exhausting. People say "Thats not the way it works though because (insert any and all mankind made rules and structure here)... I say, If we created once, we can do it again. Fear keeps people silent. Not knowing how or where to start... keeps people silent... and the Money Games consume and contaminate and continue. 😢
Brilliant. Congrats Ren, well done!
Absolutely amazing! Ren straordinario!❤
The way the last line connects to the chorus of the first Money Game. We're all just gears intertwined, running round and round until we snap
To be honest, Ren's wet shirt pecs were too distracting 😍
Oh my days Ren , that was worth the wait in every aspect , the thought and work putting this together for us all to enjoy is something to behold , there's nobody else in the world doing what you do , the whole thing was cinematic and had me gripped from the initial countdown , the choice of venue was amazing and did all it needed to do , Sam's camera work was something to behold also , can't speak highly enough of this piece of art because that's what you've created here performance art , I honestly wouldn't be surprised if Hollywood came knocking at your door one day soon as your a natural in front of the camera and enthralling to watch couple that with the fact your a handsome bastard,  well done Ren you absolutely smashed this out of the park and congratulations to all your friends and the team that support you , I'm sure I speak for everyone when I say just how grateful we all are for the effort you deliver us and the legacy of your music 🎉
Come on
Wow
Up you Go son! Amazing once again❤
.. are you taking your meds ?
Ren strikes again and never fails. Amazing heartbreaking truths you tell Ren in a very artistic poetic way. You are the gift that keeps on giving. And by the way you look so hot in a suit! 😊❤️
Masterpiece. This is where poetry meets music.
Ummmm. Just. Wow!!!!
And Sam was nervous about it. Top teir production!  And for a part 3 this sure came unexpected. What a nice suprise to have Jimmy paired with the twin siblings 1 and 2. The raise and fall for the individual engaging in the money game. Encapsulated in 10 minutes. Amazing how one aspect of ones life fits in that time. And it hits hard. We're all part and contributing to this fantasy "money". As a dad, it's hard to find the right path for your kids.
Consistently groundbreaking. Rens music changes the way I see the world after every single song. Rare artist 👏
30 seconds in and it’s already so compelling, well done Ren
Damn Ren! Leaving no crumbs here, man! The way you held that silence… …you had me on tenterhooks. Such pertinent & emotive lyrics. The way you encapsulate the zeitgeist & reflect contemporary social issues from the individual’s perspective and make it universally empathetic is astounding. Let alone setting it to incredible music and acting it out too. Mind blowing 🤯 So glad to have your music in my life 💖🥰
Ren never fails to live up to the hype, and I'll be standing by that sentence for all my life.
Already waiting for part 4 😂
What.The.Heck  absolutely genius. Thank you for your music
Always a masterpiece!
Is this the story of James Garfield? 🤔
Just… WOW!! I don’t know if there is anything else to be said. 👏👏👏
Stellar!
How is this already over, felt like a few seconds.  I still want Ren to do something with Bo Burnham though, i feel like that would be an amazing creation.
MATE, this has got to be the best thing you've ever done... Which speaks volumes cause you made a million brilliant things..
Amei demais a música, uma bela obra de arte! 🇧🇷
Congrats!!!!
If this isn't your 2024 Sundance short film submission , it should be.
Genius 🎩
I've never heard such an artist. Making people think about their own lives. People treating money like their own religion and ruining the world. Hence his Adam and Eve story from the Bible. His religion is believing in us....God, or whatever you believe in. What an artist,  holy shit...what a story. Hi Ren? More important , thanks Ren.
You'll get hate for this, because powerful people don't like mirrors. But wow, a vary fitting ending to a masterpiece trilogy 👏 😍.
Thank you, Ren!
Jaw dropped in absolute awe and is staying there. The wordplay, the story, the rhymes. I have this man down as the most incredible talent in the industry right now.....up there with all time. Insane talent Ren.
Big up for Sam ❤
I‘ve never commented on a YouTube video, but this kind of brilliance deserves it. My jaw was on the floor for 9 minutes. It’s a masterpiece.
Ren, you are a brilliant young man!  I pray for you and may God bless and heal you!!!❤❤❤
This was intense. Thank you. 🩶🩶🩶🩶🩶
Your videos are like short films & i’m here for them all, well done Ren & Sam 🎶❤️👏👏👏
Whoaaaaah 😮😮😮 Certainly been the year of Ren ❤❤❤
Wow.  This brought me to tears. I don’t know what else to say except this was amazing.
This just made my day!!!❤❤❤
i actually love your music so much, never stop whatchu do bro, its amazing.
I havent been this excited in a long time at the prospects of seeing an artist live for the first time but i can not wait for the day i get to see ren perform live
Just as part 2, just as the song that made me love this channel, there is a clear, powerfull critic and message, not burried in to the subtext, but clear and out lound, never fearing telling the true. This is art. This is revolution.
Your storytelling ability is top notch, this song is another masterpiece in your collection.
🔥🌹
That's the shortest 9 minutes and 19 seconds ever. WOW!!!
incredible - My Pomeranian was in my arms while I was watching it... and she twitched right when the trigger is pulled... even she was invested in this masterpiece
The world just stood still for 9 mins....beautiful savagery 🖤
A very powerful piece of art. Congratulations to you and all the team ren 👏👏👏
Standing ovation from me 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Absoloutely awesome, reminded me of Childish Gambino's this is America. Wishing you all the success with the new album. So cool that you've remained independant.
Fuck...... is all that I could mutter out of mouth after watching. Even minutes later, as I write this, I can't seem to find the words. I love how deep your art and music is. Much love brother.
damn
Muchas gracias Ren❤ eres increíble ❤
Absolute brilliancy from Ren yet again. Love it.
Wow! Thats not just a tune, it’s a Westend show! Superb✌🏻✌🏻😎
Whhaaaat?! That was amazing! 🤩
PS..just  subscribed..😅😅
This is just ridiculously amazing, so talented. Ren clearly went all in with the video and the production and then you have that pure poetry… just incredible.
Yeah this is worthy of some kind off an award. Great music and the video is a masterpiece. You did brighten my day up alittle!
❤this is brilliant,  well worth waiting for 😊
This is a great video, on all levels! Thanks to all of you who were involved!
Powerful stuff. Wow. Not what I expected but I loved it. The ending definitely had Money Game 1 vibes in how provocative and intense it was. Bravo to everyone involved. 👏
❤❤❤❤ W O W ❤❤❤❤
What a fabulous artist you are, Ren. This is more than music. You are the superstar we all need 🤍
Well worth the wait Ren, brilliant 🎉
Beautiful!! Just as excepted!
Bravo 👏👏👏👏 maestro!!
Hard hitting message. All round superb piece of performance art 👏👏👏
Holy crap.
The absolute best artist to ever live, we love your music ❤️
You are the goat
Whoah!
Ren literally explaining how this versatile world functioning under 10 mins, you're such a inspiring storyteller thank you Ren
Peace and love from the wirral peninsula,bounded by the mersey and the Dee and the Irish sea...geography and rhyme..hope to see you here one fine day ( as opposed to a horrible one..!! L..slainte..E..❤❤😊😊
Ren, I never preorder albums but your music is the exception. You are a poet, a prophet and a force for good. You are changing lives. I’m so happy you are out there. You literally are “hope”. I wish you joy, peace and good health.
This is genius incarnate
Goosebumps Ren <3<3<3
Mi fai vibrare l’anima. Hai abilità, talento, gusto ed intelligenza fuori dall’ordinario. Continua a coltivarli perché le nostre anime hanno bisogno di vibrare. Sei pura arte e come tale hai il rarissimo dono di costruire ponti tra il finito e l’infinito. Grazie.
Tiktok sent me here 😊 im in love ❤️
This guy is a true musician not a rapper,. I think he's got years of great music from before he went viral
Love this part 3 to Money Game Ren.  Your talent really shows on this one.  A masterpiece! ❤
Its started out so relatable but then turned into a full modern novel. Lyrics so visual💥
Now on a Easter egg hunt before Knox Hill finds them.
❤️
Luigi is still expanding
I've always wanted to hear lyrics to Beethoven. I would love to see you do a show with Lynn Manuel-Miranda and Joey Batey from the Witcher. A bardic sitcom if you will.
LETS GOOOOOO
WOW!!!... I got no words!!!  amazing comes to mind though!!!
Wow...no words....well just one ....LOVE!! ❤
Easily your best video so far, please keep it coming, we all love it
Masterpiece
My god, this is SO POWERFUL! Well done, REN and everyone involved!🇨🇦❤
This is the Ren that I found in the beggining. The dedicated rap songs are all good showing the talent, but its these that show the genius... Its these videos that get shared and remembered.
Over 32k views in 32 mins.... ❤
THIS WAS SICK (BOI) 🔥
Captivating my guy  genius 🫡🙏🏼👌🏼🔥🔥🔥
I love ren
Y la guitarra?
this is what GENUINE ART is and i knew ren will never disappoints us..never ever...thankfully..
The sad, sad truth of where we are as a whole and how some of us, as individuals, come to be searching in the wrong place for something to fill us up. Empowered in the wrong ways, enabled and then  inevitably that means disempowered. The wrong power and the imbalance of power leaves a tragic mess. Some days it's overwhelmingly depressing, but your music and your tales bring some hope Ren, thank you. From the very start - let's always whisper to our children and those around us about their true worth! ❤
@Ren, you are so creatively brilliant. I would be very interested to see a musical movie by you.
Did it again!!!!
That was absolutely amazing!!!!!! I want to say that is the absolute best piece of work I will, and have ever seen….   Ren  Thank you 😔
this hade me on the brink of tears, never stop what your doing and know u always will have my love and respect
A masterpiece on every fucking level.  You're a gift to this fucked up world. Don't ever forget that.
damn he did it again !
Chills up and down my spine. Breathtaking my friend!!
Top bananas. Will be sharing this.  Ren gimme my plectrum back! 😂
That has hit me real hard. I don't even know exactly what im feeling right now.
Yooo, that video was sick, boi.
Netflix, give Ren the call please
Excellent....
Oh Ren, your performance is such captivating from the first second till the end...you made us witness a whole ife of Jimmy in 9 minutes with the ups and downs, I hope you all the success you deserve and you deserve it all best of luck you are such loved 💜
Ren never ceases to amaze me with his brilliant song writing, absolute chills when he calls to stop the music. Thank you for everything you do Ren. You inspire me on a daily basis. Keep up the good fight. -Ryan
Congrats Ren on MG3! Hoping your album does big numbers
Thomas Shelby wants his G card back he needs it for one more season
I am speechless. Your Storytelling is exceptional. Can’t wait for the new record!
🔥🔥🔥
what a masterpiece and a perfect end love it
Another great piece of art. Feeding the algorithm.
okay, I know it's totally besides the point of the track but... Damn Ren, you in that suit just changed my sexual orientation and I am now very confused.   Absolutely stellar lyrics too, It would be a great addition to most econ classes, we were mostly only taught about the sunny side of things in college but had to explore the underbelly on our own
View to like ratio is crazy
Nearly popped a joint from how hard i shivered at the first vocal... holy fuck man
there is no one else like you, you are outstanding, congratulations on another masterpiecie Ren👏👏
A great song is one that leaves you breathless with appreciation for hearing it.  When you combine a great song with a video that is stunning in technical complexity and art, you end up with an audio-visual masterpiece. This video made me nervous from the outset but we need to be shaken out of our complacency to realise we are all being played by the rich politicians who want us to look anywhere except where they are busy screwing the country.  Someone else out it this way - “Money money money it’s a rich man’s world”.   Loving you creativity Ren.  Simon T
Hi there Ren. It's been a little while, and I missed thee.
Typical Ren. smashing it,  The 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 🐉 spitting spitting 🔥 again
Another piece of art! So happy you made a number 3
Uncommon understanding uncompromising execution this is Art. Whisper of the first voice echo of the last. ❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥
You are so talented, I am so glad you are using your talent to spread a message rather than just entertain like most artists today
Your talent is next level. I can't wait for my vinyl 🎉❤😊
Every time, I think there's no way Ren can make an every more amazing piece of art, and every time he proves me wrong. Amazing
This is not music! Or at least music is only a minor element. This is poetry, social commentary, a play. A highly complex exhibition of logistics and planning. It’s brilliant. Thought provoking. I watched with my heart in my throat. The camera work and sound recording was masterful. Thank you Ren ❤❤
👏👏
REN YOU FUCKIN DID IT AGAIN
❤
Damn… Exciting… Thrilling… Powerful… Despairing…. TRUTHFUL AND BEAUTIFUL! Excellent piece
7 billion apes with god complex and a habit for theft, throw a disaster in the mix and maybe a billion is left.
Damn... Just wow...
Really enjoyed that installment and lets hope some sheep took notice of what you are saying
People killed eachother long before the concepts of money and politics were invented
Creativity off the charts! So powerful! Visually and audibly! Truly your Magnum Opus!  These words fall short...
Astonishing,  absolutely mesmerising, and so very meaningful - absolute genius!
man you've done it again
👏 👏 👏  Beautiful
I'm blown away, Ren! The story of Jimmy sits right up there with Jenny, Screech, and Violet. One of your best. And that's after seeing and hearing it only once through! 👏👏👏 I see guys I've known personally and some only through their positions of power who have headed and are continuing to head to this ultimate end and conclusion. But no one is immune to it, including me.
Speechless...
Missed it because I thought that I had 58 minutes but these were seconds… (see why I couldn’t participate in the games? Single mum has no brains left in the evening 😅) But: Ganz großes Kino! … Like we like to say where I live. I needed to tell my teen boy to make some space on the sofa so that I could play it on the bigger screen (and the quality is neat 👌). Literally (!) BREATHTAKING. THANK YOU, beautiful people! 🖤❤
Jeez Louise I stopped breathing for 9:19.  Congratulations Ren and MG3 team.  Jesus Christ.
What I love about Ren is his ability to tap into any emotion. His upbeat fun stuff is, well, upbeat and fun while his somber stuff has a gravitas to it that hits like a truck. Like Ren, I'm an agnostic. But, if I was a christian, I would believe he is the second coming. Wisdom beyond his years with the talent to get the message across. I believe! I can't believe I'm saying this, but the world needs Ren - spread the word. Peace, love and hope to our brothers and sisters around the world, regardless of colour or beliefs.
Holly fuvk, that was intense. Apply for job in Hollywood man
One of the greatest things I ever got the chance to hear. Thank you and please continue making great music like this.
he told us it was ambitious.  he was right. and it's fully realised.  bravo. there aren't enough superlatives to fully express everything i am trying to process right now. Just perfect. i will be digesting this one for awhile. congratulations ren.... sam ... all of the many players involved. beautiful art. so glad to be here in the ren era. ❤
Smh brilliant
Bravo! 🎉 Performance! A theatre performance! 🤔 Is that one of the next moves; will you take these pieces to the theatre?😮
No stopping you and your talent
Loved the guitar solo in the premier countdown.
@knoxhill I'm apart of the Ren algorithm I hope this matrix never ends 😎
Holy shit.
Another masterpiece brilliant so so so good ❤❤❤❤
god damn. You genius. shoutout to that cameraman and the choreography.
Brilliant!
...is... is that... rain rain rain?
Absolutely Incredible
Brilliant, again!🐢🇺🇸
“Parasites within a Petrie dish” another one take #truthbomb.
Absolutely brilliant
Money isn't a bad thing though.
Great stuff. Making music that makes you wanna take notice. Keep on doing what you’re doing cos it’s important ❤️
I wish we could have everyone listen to this song and actually hear the words being said
this the truth, people needs to wake uppppp
wow
Magnum Opus. But for you Ren, it's just gonna be one of many.
You know when characters in Bleach go Bankai? Ren and Sam on the videography.
just, WOW
Best work yet fkn fire 🔥
Oh my.
So so proud of you and your mate. You have elevate music to another level.
Thank you 🙏
WoW! Absolute MASTERPIECE  And the irony of it that for me the ad following the video is one for investment 😳
Superb, Ren and Sam. 😎
Ren you are a brilliant actor, masterpiece ❤
Utterly incredible. More than worth the wait!!
just amazing, and the countdown to the vid was genius...
I love how this man puts refrences to his other songs like around the start you hear the music from Tales of like Jenny n shit
Just wow
True art ❤️ I am really glad to find Ren and Big Push about one year ago and since then I have next view of Real music
Thank you, Ren, for creating things that really matter.  May this start a ripple that never ends...  Much love.
Brilliant
Великолепно!
🫶✨✌️
Amazing story telling!!! As always! 🔥💯💜👌👏 fair play!
Wow. Worth the wait.
That an independent artist could create a video that any popular artist today would be proud to say was theirs is bonkers.  Sam is as genius behind the camera as Ren is in front performing.  I don’t know what else to say other than it’s perfection that hurts your heart in both good and sad ways.
Another masterpiece 👏👏👏
Another masterpiece from Ren don’t understand how he does it, Wordplay, flow and instrumental go so well together also never lacks on pleasing us with a movie too watch too. The scenes he creates throughout his music and takes you on a journey throughout his own universe. Once he’s finished with all his music would love too see them all his music working together as a movie. The Storyline will be insane!🔥
Hi Ren , you did it again ❤ Another creative art piece.  Thank you for the time and effort you put into these  videos for us. Can't wait to see what you have in store for us next whether it's music,  a Netflix series or even a children's book😆😆😆💯🔥
Ren is quite an artist !
wow <3
YEAH BABY?
Last week I turned 46, so I guess I survived the game...
I totally see this artist writing a whole musical one day. I simply adore this. Thank you 🙌🙌🙌🙌
ren gets better with every song
amazing actually awesome the only thing is the trigger safety in the gun scene but it is just a simple detail that doesn't matter if we just look at the amazing story told and the music
BIG LOVE REN
This isn't just music, it's art. A bonafide masterpiece! Incredible, Ren.
Pure brilliance
Absolutely legendary! ❤
Congratulations Ren and Sam! This was genuis! Incredible!
GOAT
Holy shit.
That was great Ren. As expected!
This is the power of art. To hold up a mirror to ourselves. Sure sometimes it’s distorted or exaggerated but there’s still a lot of truth there. And hopefully if we’re paying attention we can take the chance to reflect and change.   “And his example is exaggerated versions of me and it’s a version of him and it’s a version of she and it’s a version of you.” Perfection.
I like it. I like it a loooooot 🫶🫶
Left me speechless! ❤
Oh wow, i cannot express how much this impressed me. I can already tell this will be stuck in my brain for months. That’s how you know something is really good. Amazing job and i am definitely sending this to all my friends<3
❤️‍🔥
Most creative artist ever award winner contestant… wow Ren!
I remember when the first Money Game came out. I was expecting something amazing, but this... This is more than that
I pre ordered the album, cant wait to get it!!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉
As always the video is more incredible short film than just a typical music video … I know this is a cliche, but seeing Ren in that gangster-as-f*ck suit made me swoon more than a little ❤❤❤
Wow. As with everything, this hit hard. That man is my younger brother. He was given the keys to the kingdom as my father’s sole son and he grew up to be a horrible, unethical human being.   And I’m just out here with 2 major medical conditions just happy I’m still alive to hear great music.
It’s just brilliant. I’ve been following you and your journey for years now, best decision I’ve ever made. You’re a legend
Production-crew outdid themself in this video! Camera-Crew with that spiraling shot through the piano without seeing a reflexion or other crewmembers at the beginning and from there going in an oneshot-video where the whole crew, light and soundequipment had to be carried with the shot?!  Just amazing!
Another masterpiece!
That last line, I was waiting for it, yet it sent chills entirely down my body. Your storytelling is insane Ren ❤❤❤
The best art ever created on this planet. Take that Rembrandt.
DA IAWN BRAWD
My dear Lord... this is an unprecedented act of Art ...  Pure love of art and the message and the dedication behind it is just Crazy.  Never have I ever seen any "music project" of that caliber. Outdone yourself once again Ren. Outdone yourself and we were already expecting it.  Chapeaux to everyone behind this whole MG part3 journey. What a Hype.. what a masterpiece.. what an Artist.
Congratulations Ren and Sam it is brilliant!
this is genius level Ren again . bless you Ren, this is simple and pure to understand. awesome. catching vibes of this is america, CG, visually. huge kudos brother
Brilliant
Absolutely brilliant, a work of art tangled in the deceit and deception of our world the human struggle. Money is the route of all evil and has been created as a control, made to be a need to many to press the endorphins for just a little while to keep you hooked. Ren a masterpiece thank you for baring your soul
all the love
This is another one of those where it's not a song - it's a performance art piece. Story, music, videography, and acting. This is the art I find feeding my soul and living for.  Bravo to all involved
Awesome as ever…
Artist, musician, teacher, storyteller, healer. EPIC!
Wow, just wow, I’m speechless. You are going places man, which I’m sure you already know. Your capability to use your art to convey meaningful messages is beyond any other. Will support you as long as I last ❤️‍🔥
❤Absolutely stunning video, performance and music
WoW...I got nothing but just wow ❤
Another masterpiece written by Ren. Incredible and deep lyrics. Love it!
Absolutely brilliant from beginning to end ❤️🔥 I only wish the countdown could have stayed because that was fire too. Worth being up ridiculously early in Australia before work for - thank you Ren, and Sam!
This is the type of content the world needs. TRUTH!!!!!
Bravo 👏🏻 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Lets go
Holy friggin moly! Ren!!!!! That was incredible! I mean, we all knew it would be amazing but damn!!! Damn!!!
That final line though...
Masterful, impactful storytelling. As with many of your songs, it hits deep. Bravo.
Bloody marvellous...again!! Ren, you never fail to impress.
Oh... my God.
Actually insane, mad respect.
WOW Ren wow
amazing
That was fucking great lad.
WHOOHOO 🎉
It's a masterpiece. Bravo Ren, you are really a genius: the text is great, the music that I classify as "classical" is great, the staging is superb and you are an outstanding actor. I love your world.
That went by so fast that I was certain it was going to continue because there was no way 9 minutes had elapsed. I need to rewatch again ❤ The different elements  drawn from your work interweaved to create a new whole. Could Jimmy be an  alternate life of James ( Screech) if circumstances of birth were different? 🤷‍♀️ another tragedy of a different ilk as it were. I'm sure everyone has  their own interpretation 😊 i will read comments with interest. Thank you  Ren ❤
Nice suit. And a great piece of art.
phenomenal...revolutionary tales of truth and wisdom. tremendous mate
Just got chills runs down my spines. The Video, The Lyric are all so good. To all who is in the making of this Video, you(s) made a Masterpiece
What a beautiful song. I could see an opera performing this as a symphony.
...
Just keeps getting better brother. Salute. Thank you.
Sheeeeeesh
Magnificent!
Absolutely incredible. Phenomenal cinematography, music, just pure art. You are one of the most amazing music artists ever. I don’t comment a lot but this is too good to not gush about!
Oh wow that did not feel like 9 minutes. I got completely immersed
That was impressive 👏
Absolutely genius video.
Amazing!
Every  time i go , "surely he can't do this that different " and everytime you do , All i can say is wow Ren another Masterpiece .
I have two issues with this song. The first two parts established a consistent chorus which was not implemented into part 3. That inconsistency makes me wish the song had an independent title. The second issue is that Ren seems to advocate against capitalism a lot and sounds a bit socialist. Historically time and time again, socialism has failed. Capitalism drives innovation and production.
fundamental presupposition, the thought we go back to for support of a new idea. if our fundamental presupposition is flawed than all new ideas have no chance of making it passed our bias. or, as long as your base thought is that humans are parasites on the planet than you will never see anything else. good luck with killing enough people through poverty, oil prices, and esg agendas to make your eutopia ren. you will need it as the rest of us won't just lay down.
What did I just watch? The vocals, the piano, this song is phenomenal. The scene in the beginning is fire. Amazing job creating this, Ren!
Amazing, Ren. Well done!!!
daaamn! could take my eye of this!
I love everything about this except you holding a gun to your head!!! Whilst I understand it artisically it makes me anxious. You are an artist Ren. ❤❤❤
👌🎶👌
MASTERPIECE as always REN
GOAT!!!
Thankful to be alive while Ren evolves in front of us.  He is like no other before him.   Sinéad nailed it with her comments back in July.   ❤
my heart has been beating out of my chest with the money game, now mg3. great job ren- this is basically a tales, without the guitar.   my mind tells me that i should hate those like jimmy, but i've got to say- my heart bleeds for those like him, just as it bleeds for those whose lives he's destroyed. it's weird, i guess, that my logic tells me that i should hate others, and it's weird that i've been disappointed when ~despite the logic~ i don't hate those who "deserve" it.  but- logically, my mind also tells me that there isn't such a thing as "deserving" and "undeserving"; i've been disappointed when my heart tells me otherwise.  the longer i live the more lost i am in the wilds of logic and heart- but, the more i'm grounded in those wilds, too. there is, imo, only making the best of my logic, and my heart, and hoping that ~through me, and others like me, and others not like me~ there will be a world where ppl aren't "deserving" and "undeserving";   that my logic and heart ~and the world they live in~ will no longer be in the wilds. that my logic and heart, and all others', will no longer be at war.
This is everything I expected and nothing I expected!! It's by far the best work you have done !!  A MASTERPIECE !!!!
Thank you once again mate
So powerful. So well thought out and put together. And sadly, so true.
I love it ❤
WoW!  Just freaking WoW!! 😵 My jaw is still hanging down. 🤤❤️‍🔥
Oh my my my!  This might be the best song you've ever written!  I was so glad to be able to see it live. This, my friend, is your Magnum Opus. You should be very happy with this one.  Thank you so much! ❤❤
This is fucking beautiful! Amazing ! Insane !😳 fuckinh awesome well done definitely worth the wait !!!! Take a bow !!
WOW. . Just wow!!  If that doesn't hit you 'in the feels' then i don't know what will!!!  You are a bloody lyrical genius and the creativity of your music videos, well, what's to say! Obsessed 😍 Honestly, the best artist of our time. 😊 Stay true to yourself Ren. . You deserve all the love your listeners give you.  I'm honoured to have your music in my life. .
Can’t believe they burnt the money!! Have you not expressed yourself enough about GREED!!!
Genius. Just genius. This isn't a song. It's the antidote to a world gone mad.
An absolut show!  Well done master Ren 👏
HOLY SHIT...  dude. Dude... DUDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Amazing just amazing
Amazing story once again, camera work was amazing as well. I loved the reflection in the piano wing when moving away. It's another sad truth being told over music but I'm missing a little bit of song vibe, felt more like a truthful poem with music added to it, so won't really find a place in my playlist with the other money game's and all the rest of Ren. But will definitely come back here to add to the views every now and then. 👌
My Heart Is Heavy 😔💔🙏  This hits too home for WAYYYYY too Many......😔😔😔
10k likes after 30mis❤  I love your music so much. I'm happy others do too.
absolutely the Masterpiece i knew it would be…. wow
WWW finally!!
Holy shit-balls. A brilliant, moving, epic and so desperately needed voice. Thank you.
This is amazing your music is so good!❤️
Just had to rewatch and rewatch, totally engrossed and transfixed. You are not of this world, an absolute masterpiece of art. Just in awe 😍
Shook my head in amazement repeatedly.
REN you are a GENIUS  from Finland
Just amazing.
Sometimes the medicine we need tastes aweful, but without it, we can't get better. This was a bitter pill to swallow. Thank you for trying to help Ren.
Wow
Absolutely in awe. I watched the live today and was blown away by your words and again here. I hope these videos blow up and really get people thinking. ❤ Keep doing what you're doing, Ren.
Holy. Shit.
Incredible
Pure GENIUS end of.....
That you ren… just that. Thank you.
Damn, insane piece. Personally, I think this is your best song, and the character-focus makes your point come across a lot better than I think it did in parts 1 & 2.
Well done Ren, this is spectacular 🎉
Wow!
Wow
❤❤❤❤❤❤
amazing
This song reminded me of the crime that happened last spring in my country when the thirteen year old boy killed the security guy and nine kids in the school . They say that his parents pushed him to hard to be the best in his school class, but he could not be so he cracked and did what he did. He was put in the psychiatry hospital, and they say that when his mother came to see him he asked her:"Are you satisfied now?"
Ren, As usual we are left in awe and wanting more!
You inspire me
Goosebumps. Brilliant in every way! ❤
What an incredible talent, both musically and visually! Chefs kiss!
holy shit this is just a masterpiece, no other word for it
🔥
альбом будет?
Even peoples dreams are manipulated. They dream of having money, lots of money! Instead of "We are good. We're ALL good!". Thanks Ren, again!
Brilliant ❤
fire
Very artistic, I miss the popping choruses 😅
Utterly smashed it
The best of your recent stuff, video was great as usual.
Literally a masterpiece… bravo Ren… Bravo!
WOW! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
EPIC!!!
Speechless, simply speechless
WOW, just wow.  A captivating masterpiece.
Jimmy has an interesting storyline. Will have to analyze on further listens.
This is absolutely mesmerizing, from beginning to end.
You did it again bro freaking awesome I love all your music and what you do oh, I wish you the best and stay healthy I will always pray for you
Well then...So, that just happened.  The storytelling is tremendous. . .wow
Bruh was just getting into Chocolate Rain when you stopped him.
Absolute genius 🤘
Class, both musically and cinematically.
Worth the wait and it justified the build up. Masterpiece.
Incredible!!
With every piece of art Ren comes up with, with every production that chases the last in its quality and innovative ideas...  I can't imagine where it goes next but I am all here for it, finding out! Let's GOO!!
I am so fucking grateful for your being.
What an absolute masterpiece bro. Love it
Perfection! ❤
The future poet laureate. Just astonishing.
I know it’s a sin. But I want more, more, MORE, MORE MORE!!! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Be careful  Ren ,
HOLY WHAT A BANGER
WHAT IN THE NAME OF TOBLERONES IS THIS? PURE GENIUS!!!
Always releases poetics masterpieces
Ren is Idol of Truth
Holy shit.... this is an absolute masterpiece.. its like listening to "Hi Ren" over again.. the storytelling, the emotion, the truth, the videography.. the whole composition.. you are remarkable.. the world needs people like you.. the world needs you.. amazing work once again ❤
Congratulations Ren each of your new releases is a work of art There are no saints💯💯🔥🌈
Genius Ren and Sam, not anything else I say but pure quality.
Renoir!!! Amazing
Living Legend
What a brilliant masterpiece! This transcends music!
I WILL NEVER EVER STOP MAKING MUSIC, I WILL KEEP IMPROVING AND REDEFINING MY ART UNTIL I REACH SUCH LEVEL OF MASTERY.  I SWEAR TO GOD THIS LEFT ME SPEECHLESS MAN. AN INSPIRATION FOR A GENERATION OF ARTISTS. LONG LIVE THE TRUE ART.
Algorithm gods be pleased
Masterfully penned and impeccably showcased.
Here for Support ❤
One for the algorithm
🔥
Thomas Shelby vibes when he points the gun to his head
:))))
:O - This maybe the most wild journey or a song a music video I have even been on!   Bravo... Standing ovation... Encore...
The story is too deep for the mere cerebrum to comprehend our cerebral cortex engineer us to be insensitive to the money power
what an accomplishment ren, congratulations
Yesssssss ren!! 🤟
❤
Happy to be here so soon! Your music is incredible. Lots of love from the Czech Republic <3
Listened to it within 30 minutes of its release. A masterpiece indeed!
Pure art❤
63 years spaniard and never been so excited  about an artist for that long i just can´t remember.
That's a masterpiece From vocals,to music and cinematography I'm speechless 😮😶❤
Well...  That's going to require a few more viewings.
Wow 👌 Another masterpiece, man. I didnt think Hi Ren could be touched.
Simply stunning!
I love Ren but this is a bit overdone. Money does not make human nature and blaming money for human nature is childish.
Absolutely amazing ❤❤
I love that your music and videos are proper ART ❤ such insight and passion and love and truth. Thank you
I discovered Ren at the start of the year with I'm Ren. I must say the stories Ren tells and this song and video shows just his talents. You deserve all the praise you get for this mini movie. The guys a genius. Thanks for making my 2023 music experience a great one.
Amazeballs Ren and Sam!!! Absolutely SMASHED it OUT of the park once again!
Soooooooooooo GOOD!   :)
I was here when Money Game part 1 dropped. Was here when part 2 dropped. And this is INCREDIBLE, I'm happy to be here for part 3.
A playwright needs to collaborate w Ren & create a stage production.
The framing of the reflection in the piano was just beautiful. Great video. Can’t wait to hear about all the hard work that went in to this at REN’s Garden Party this Saturday!
Absolutely love this Ren❤️ P.S love from Sweden 🇸🇪❤️
Amazing😍
There's just no words to describe how well you can emotionally move people with your music, storytelling, and visuals
well that was a work of pure art if ever there was one, strong message , left me kinda stunned, job done, gotta get this album , bloody brilliant
Unbelievable Ren always trying to imagine what your going to do next and I never guess right. You are a true inspiration not only for me but the whole world. Keep your head high and show the world who Ren is and how the world needs to change.  Amazing work and passion also amazing team you have congratulation on your achievements and very excited to see your future. 🐷💷🎮🎰🤴🍾🍾❤
Damn. Speechless.
Every video you put out has me getting emotional. Incredible choreography and seamless storytelling. I stopped getting excited about music a while ago and it was one of the hardest times for me as music was how I related, drove myself, and even just passed time. Ren, you are the first artist in years that has me excited for music again and I can't thank you enough. It has been a pleasure following your journey this far.  I wish the best for you and I look forward for what's to come.
Worth the wait!  Let's put a mirror in front of every face and a Sick Boi album in every pot.
Masterful, artful and truthful. Ren smashes everything.
The whole Money Game trilogy is Masterpi 🥧 I'm an Indigenous '2-eyed seeing' economist (ie: not a capitalist), and love how spot on you have targeted the money game. Green breeds mean deeds, as the old hippie chant goes - and I concur now is the time for system change. Oh, and FYI - WELCOME to so-called Canada... where White Supremacy runs the money game while openly committing Anti-Indigenous GENOCIDE on these stolen lands you are currently a guest of. Colonizers be colonizing!
Well done Ren, as per usual a work of art.
The transition's are perfect every time brother
Art
You're an a$$hole for making me feel these things! I love you more with every tear. Be well Be free
Just WOW!!  Masterpiece
Love. Was sick boi!
5 mins into it 🔥
Wow!!!!!!
Wow 👏
Ren is amazing
NEED MORE PEOPLE TO LISTEN TO REN
A lot to unpack right there. Amazing video and cinematography, sound, props, acting, music and rapping - and a thought provoking story and message. I think I sat here for a minute or two just pondering in silence afterwards.
I can’t remember ever leaving a comment on YouTube but I’m just completely awestruck.  I found your music a few days ago and I haven’t stopped listening, you’re with me in the morning, at work, at dinner and before bed. You’ve struck something in me and given me a new perspective on life.   Thank you so much Ren, it’s a pleasure to be able to both see and hear your work, you truly are an amazing artist.
❤❤
A bard named Ren 🙏🏻
Absolutely phenomenal
Waiting for this and lords of the fallen was the highlight of my week.
Jeez man. Behave! What are you doing to me?  What a bloody day, you’ve wrung me out!
Certainly a masterpiece. Gets you thinking. Well done REN & Sam.
absolutely beautiful
Others have said it better, but, this is powerful and so well done ❤
Absolutely mind-blowingly ... genius
It really captivated me and gave me chills ... wow... The words, the story, the performance, the characters, the attributes and one hell of a choreography.
A masterpiece of storytelling and cinematography. Incredible. Well done Ren and Sam. This is amazing!
Well, that hitted like a bullet train...
already a master piece before I even watched it
As always 🙌🙌🙌
Just wonderful in millions of ways. Bloody well done, sir.
MASTERPIECE. Este tio es un genio. lo mejor de los ultimos 10 años.
Thank you, Ren! I am sitting here somewhat stunned as I watch this masterpiece again. All I can think to say is to share something I wrote this morning as I was thinking about the impact you have had on me, and so many others. You have done so much to make it okay to not be okay. You've made it cool to be vulnerable and authentic. Your story of perseverance and hope is an inspiration to so many people. And you have done it all as an independent artist and while fighting for your own physical and mental health. And from everything I have seen, all of this was no accident. You have been very intentional about your messaging. Well done, sir!
WHO EVER SHOT THIS, GREAT JOBBB
damn this is an absolute masterpiece
Ren is a genius! ❤❤❤
GOAT
The end is simply perfect
Masterpiece, without a doubt, the best and most important album in decades!
It took me until my 40's to see the world as you both have displayed in this video.   To see that those who came after I did, see this clearly before I did, is truly a gift to this planet and should give inspiration and hope to us all.  If you have the means at hand, you have the responsibility to act.  Rule 303  Together, we can find purpose and meaning that no amount of money could achieve.  Thank you Sam and Ren ❤
Fire🔥💯💪🏾
Absolutely amazing. Fire as always!!!
I frickin loved Part 2 and 1 and I couldn't believe Part 3 could push it even further when I saw it's coming. But you did it again Ren! Absolutely fell in love with everything on the first watch, the story, the lyrics overall, atmosphere and as a filmmaker myself - the video production also!  Great job everyone working on this.
I would watch a Ren and Sam play, next stop Broadway baby!
Holy shit
As a father of 3 this message hits home...its always in the back of my mind as a parent...but i shove it down and teach my kids to confrom to society so they can live a happy simple life. Is that wrong? A balance of perspective and the reality of the current world we live in is needed ... or do i raise some anarchists?
People need to see this
Yet again another wonderful piece of art! Thank you so much Ren for sharing all these masterpieces.
I ADORE YOUR MUSIC
🤯
Hard to comment... at a loss for words... still trying to process the wild ride these last 2 hours have been... my mind is blown all over again by your mind and your dedication...
another Masterpiece
Damn, fine video. Stopped me cold.
Wow
HOLY SHIT HE DOES IT AGAIN!! 🔥❤
It's so good straight up masterpiece, art at its finest
WhAT A GENIUS
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 incredible!!!!! Wow!!!!!
Bless you my brother ! You are as real as they come !
You can watch artists develop over a lifetimes career to do what this lad is achieving. It's more than hip hop, more than music or poetry, or theatre, truth or fiction. This is Rens art, and it's unique amongst anything Ive experienced in my 50yrs on this planet. Go get 'em son
So much love for you!!
Holy. Shit. Amazing! Thank you and God Bless you Ren!
Oh holy shit, ren. That was magnificent 😮 💜 🍋
This is absolutely amazing!!!
I can't wait for Netflix or whichever platform you end up on!!!
goosbumps! Amazing!
Yep. Thought it was too long before starting, then thought it wasn't long enough. Obviously not something people would listen to again and again like Money Game Part 1 or 2, but damn does it hit hard.
fuck yah, only 1/2 way through but had to comment. this is magnificent. totally balls. love it
Wow!!!
I feel like I’m watching history in the making. Amazing work Ren, Sam, all the musicians and others who worked on this ❤
You did it again. We waited, you delivered.  Great work, Ren.
9 minutes in 1 take is insane
What a ride! 9 mins felt like 2 because of how entranced I was in the story
DAYUMN!!!
Ren rings the bells! Wake Up People!
Outstanding!!!!!
Masterpiece as always
This man is an alien 👽
woouf....
Ayyy
Ren wow
This is genius on the Hi Ren scale 🙌
Damn bro thats deep
I'm speechless, this is amazing.
"Wow" doesn't quite say it. Damn.
Thanks Ren, I have no words like others but wanted to say something. oh btw my kids want you to tour Australia, I do too. Melbourne maybe? If you ever get adventurous we all want to see you
My mind is boggled. I can’t wait to get all the details on how the heck this was shot 😆👏🏻
Didn't expect a part 3 but damn does it hit hard
Masterclass.
Ren, I can’t even put my..impressions from your art into words anymore. Feels like they become empty shells, just shells of the words this time and I momentarily feel like a shell of a person and then the next instant awaken from the deep sleep and alive to the max, and these 2 keep interchanging. Just.. a humongous hug and thank you 🤍
Ren showing us what meaningful art is ❤‍🔥
Well done 👏❤
Absolute genius.
An important message. I'm once again facing homelessness because of my chronic illnesses and America's craptastic medical system.   It's my hope that your work might allow future generations to never face this. That they won't work themselves to death with nothing to show for it.   Please keep telling the truth.  No one should have to live in fear of dying on the streets because they can't afford to pay rent.
There's no other artist that makes me hang on to every word, feel every word. Ren is leaving a mark in this world
❤❤❤❤
Awesome, love it, instant classic
This is a masterpiece, a true work of art
This was so emotional ❤ I absolutely loved it well done to everyone involved in this performance 👏 ❤️
I had goosebumps the whole way through. Thank you so much Ren and Sam and everyone involved. This comes at an important time and truly is a masterpiece
DAMN
Shaking up the whole world beneath us 🌎💥
Oh, rain, rain, rain, rain.  This was beyond amazing
Le seul et unique artiste dont j'ai écouté, j'écoute et j'écouterais les morceaux aussi vite. Merci Ren, t'as fait de moi une putain de groupie ahahahah
"Now you're a man". Beautiful, all of it.
Artistic masterpiece
Damn this hits. A valuable lesson
Just WOW!!  Masterpiece!
Loving Ren's music and story telling.
You're truly one of a kind, Ren. Please never stop.
I got literal chills. Such a masterpiece as always.  Playing with the genre, playing with the format. But always with a great message.  May it find everyone it needs to.
Fantastic!! Sooooo true. Love all your work
Lets keep this train running
F*cking incredible mate. No other words for it
Once more Ren has done it - absolute powerful truth.
This was just an "inhuman" Performance there is no better way to describe it
Ren and Dimash. Two artists I am proud of to be a witness of these boths genius creations. Thank you for giving me hope and the unimaginable beauty of love. I wish, they both meet each other.
Wow. Gonna need many rewatches of that. Incredible. That’s art
That's fire!
Great Art ❤
Fantastic  👏 👏 👏
Marvelous !
Thanks ren
Speechless 😮👏🐷🖤
Yeah baby
It genuinely confuses me how someone can be so talented
Your talent is off the scale Ren, with Money game part 1 to part 3, this is how I've been feeling about the world we live in today, I truly hope your messages get through to enough people to change things.  Your talent for putting it into a way that others can understand is amazing.  Don't ever change who you are.  Thank you Sir.
This, this is the reason people feel connected to your art. The stories you tell represent the scary reality of the world we live in where we are not truly aware of these things until someone speaks up and lays it out exactly how it is. Just today I have been telling a coworker about your creative music and the meaning behind some of the songs. After listening to one, he immediately understood.  Keep making your art, looking forward to Sick Boi tomorrow
Ren!!! This is amazing, Beautiful work. 🦀
Awesome. Think you are awesome doing this, but could be cool seeing you in a movie.
Just...wow. I can't think of anything else to say that would suitably justify your work. Pure genius. And so happy for you that it's out now and you can breathe a sigh of relief and relax a little bit! All the hard work has paid off ❤️
Another brilliant performance by a talented artist.
Ren, you have done it again, another masterpiece. Fixated from start to end!!  Your looking well
Incredible once again. So profound. Do painfully true. @Renmskesmusic you are truly unique. Your music is  beautiful & it touches my soul while simultaneously  shrirking at me to wake up to realities of, not only the  greed of others, but my own greed too.  And yes. I admit I am greedy- greedy to get my copy of your album- it's preordained so now I must wait impatiently, tapping my greedy little fingers on the nearest  surface avaliable. Hearing this track gave me  some temporary  satisfaction but noe the waiting game begins again. Tap...tap.... tap...
It's easy to get paralysed by what's going on in the world and feel totally out of control. How can we change society, how do we make it better? We can't change society but we can change ourselves and each person who changes themselves brings us one step closer to changing society. It's that simple. Love Ren, love this community.
The melding of poetic lyrics, cinematics and the timing of it all are truly so damn amazing. Great piece of art. I think I will pre-order the album. Fantastic job this whole year.
I WAS NOT EXPECTING THIS!
Good ol ren. 🙂
Masterpiece
The moderan day bard
Fuck me Ren. I’ve been searching for something of truth. Wondering if I’m mad. Here. Here is truth. Thank you for all you share and the ways you talk the talk by doing things differently. You’re not mad I’m not made. It’s time. It’s time!
Unbelievable and absolutely amazing...just shared this to the whole of South Africa 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Tbh going to need to watch a knox reaction to make any sense of that mate.
Delightfully dark .  We are all  prone to self destruct  in some shape or form.
That bit of piano at the beginning, that's what you played at the airport right Ren?
oh shit
Incredible. The scenes, the camera work, the music, the message and the flows its just true work of art. Amazing!
Just wow. Wow. Wow. This was the easiest to understand, but the hardest to digest. We are taught that money is all that we need, yet money in the end is worthless indeed. The journey we take determines the lies we tell ourselves to feel happy inside. This world we live seems hopeless so true so go live it the way that feels most true to you.   Not sure what that is I wrote. But just felt like something I needed too. Incredible video Ren. You are the 1 take master. You all worked so well together. Great job everyone there. This will definitely be one I'll be watching reactions one because I'm torn on how I feel, so I want to see how other people feel about it. Much love to you Ren, and everyone. Can't wait for the album to drop tomorrow!!
This should be lesson taught in schools. Epic
Part 1 was amazing , Part 2 was great, Part 3?  Astounding.. Well done Ren..
Awesome as always 🤩
DUDE!!! I'm speechless 😮
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏No words needed
Legend
It would be great to see you at the feat with Scarlxrd. You have similar "nihilistic" lyrical contexts in your work. Although you both have completely different styles. For real, please try to consider it Ren. Thank you if you're reading this.
Jimmy lying in a puddle of his blood and his tears, the Dominos melody being used to tell the story during the seated string section
My god, Ren, you are a magician with words! Sick rhymes!
Nailed it! Bravo Ren and the team!
I'll be taking some time to be still
I actually really liked this! Cinematically it was well made, and it felt nice to see ren go into this modern day bard again like in Screech’s, Jenny’s and Violet’s Tale. Telling a story, also with the rain at the end, presumably to fit a dark moody mood, but also to reference “Rain, rain, rain, rain” Just all very.. cool. Masterpiece!!
Epic
I will never forget the moments and memories you've made for countless people ❤ both of you and all the crew involved, if you ever do visit australia ren, please come busk or even just come have a hang 🎉
Wow! Mega nice work to All! 👏
❤❤❤🎉🤯
Fucking amazing, thank you Ren a real shining star in this world that truly has gone to shit
This was the most fascinating thing I have ever seen, the story, production camera work is genius.  it is a pity the guitar introduction was removed it just made me more interested in the whole production.   😘😘😘😘😘😘😘. Absolutely brilliant Ren. 😘😘😘😘😘🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
Wow..... just..... wow
thanks for ur music! keep up. ♥
Every track! Ren, you deserve every drop of success! Watching from busking in the streets, to gaining one million followers on socials, from that legendary diss track reply, to this highly anticipated album thats about to hit! Love seeing people succeed, and you've worked so hard for it all! Genuinely my favourite artist by a mile! 👏 massive respect.
I am blown away ❤
Wow, what a masterpiece, thanks, Ren.
Good stuff coach. Felt way shorter than it was, you know I was into it.
amazing
The Shakespeare of Music left us thinking about Humanity and Choices again. Im so thankfull to be able to listen to your music and your art.  There is no other artist with so much truth and emotions behind everything he creates that i hope everyone will have the joy of discovering Ren for the first time in their life ❤
Your story telling is wonderful and heartbreak because you don't just tell a story, what you say is true. The greed inside humans cause so much suffering and pain, every day, every where. Yet we have the power to change of we only choose to. More of us have to choose to change before we can heal the earth and create a heaven on earth for every one... But it starts with one!! Others will follow and in unity, it will become a reality for all.
Another Masterpiece, Thanks Ren.
An amazing video....song...and everything about it.   Mad respect for what you have done...well deserved.
This was gripping. An amazing job, Ren.
Absolute genius 🙏😎
Artistic perfection, as always. Thank you Ren. I pray you're overcoming this latest bout of Covid with your usual strength and resilience. Stay strong and true, brother.
I have money game pt2 as my daily alarm but I feel more awake after having watched this. incredible. you are so heartfelt and inspiring it's one of the things that help tether my placement to this earthly plane. Thank you good sir.
Wow…Just WOW 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🫶🏼
Man that first camera spin had my stomach in knots lol
This is art.
wow
Just 2 words for this masterpiece: THANK YOU!
Master storyteller!!🤯
I'm so excited for the Twitch livestream!!!
Really dont know what to say after that except ,Thankyou,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always a hit, Ren.
Crazy
powerfully thought provoking ...pure art
You're a true artist, Ren 👏 Thought-provoking as always with poetry sublime 👌 ♥️  But your latest productions seem more angry and less hopeful. Is it possible to convey a serious, hard-hitting message while retaining the playful hope you embody so beautifully?  Looking forward to getting your album tomorrow 🥳🤓
What a Masterpiece my brother. Keep on changing the game . Love it
Just amazing..
Ren, brother, your name will surely be among the greatest of all time! God bless you!
From a clumsy kid performing on a Brighton street alone, asking people, with shitty equipment and a completely varied repertoire, mostly from popular songs, to an artist, musician, mentor, teacher, screenwriter, psychologist, video producer, who has an unquenchable fire in his heart for music, filming a 9-minute video in one attempt, with a team of best friends, using all possible connections and opportunities, also in the genre of recitative combined with difficult parts on the piano. This is what inspires you to keep doing. To do any thing at all, to live. Thank you. Piece from Israel.  UPDATED: I, as a person who got out of a small town in Russia, saturated with crime, dismorality, cruelty, undeveloped economy, where the power of rich guys on leather chairs is clearly visible, I am proud that Ren reminds developed countries (Britain, USA and others) of this, where people, from a comfortable and surplus life with rose-colored glasses, completely forget about the realities of this world, and raises their awareness. For us, people from countries like Russia, this is still a humane way to reach heights through programming. It's worse when the children of the rich and powerful simply continue their legacy and don't even live.
Over 12k views in under 30 minutes! 🤯 It is absolutely brilliant! 👏

🤯❤
Wow just wow... 😮😮😮😮🤯🤯🤯🧐🤬🤬🤬🤩
Another needed message in this world of greed and misanthropy.  Thank you, Ren.  Bravo.  🌹
This is unreal  Wow  The geezer never misses 💥
I know you said it would be a masterpiece but man this really is a MASTERPIECE. I was sucked in from the first second and didn’t even realise where the time went. I have no words to describe how thankful I am for you spreading such an important message.
Great job Ren! Please please please keep it up. We are hanging by your words.
wow !!! this is fire! there is so much to see and hear in this third part
Funny that I've discovered you today with money game 2 and now you came up with a much needed money game 3. I feel so bad about society, it's probably the main reason of why i feel so bad in general. Everywhere i look i see people falling in this stupid trap we as a society created, people that are born in this mechanism and will never understand why it is so damn wrong and soulless. I want to evade from this. I don't know how. It feels impossible.
fucking hell dude, never one to go for whats expected or easy! amazing work, love it
EPIC
Took my breath away! Brilliant!
Mr R Peggio was his previous name 😂😂
Wow!
Beautiful
Finally a voice of truth for us all! Ren is a Philosopher King! And a poet speaking our language yet delivering higher truths!
You are the GOAT Ren @renofficial 4:10
Another masterpiece by the master love you ren boi❤
Unreal.  Awesome bro.  Thanks. ML&R TNJR
Wow.
This isn't one to just vibe to. It's an art piece, it's a masterpiece.
‘scrap that, I teach!’ Ren is again giving the people food for thought! A masterpiece would be an understatement! Many congrats Ren! We love your ‘baby!’ 👊
I immediately heard Violet in the beginning. So amazing, a true piece of art ❤
Hmm You’re Right Ren and at the same time criticizing human nature itself - I wish your idealism could be true but it is not. You’re Fame now and what you’re preaching is making you part of it yet another sad Harlekin who is part of this mental circus we call society. At least that is how they see you.  Still love your music and cried the first couple of times I heard some of your art.
You changing the world dude. 🙏
This was awesome and once again so much more than a song
Superb that’s all !
Fucking yaaaaaaaaaas!
Cuts so deep. How we are programmed at such a young age to worship money, judge others by their wealth status, strive to achieve certain salaries, judge and be judged by it. All in a context that is unsustainable, pillaging the planet for shareholder profit. A raw and real message. Let's share this far and wide and deep x
woah!
Absolutely incredible. The theatre kid inside me is dying from sheer joy, but the adult is fucking speechless.
Yeah!! Go! Bwoi!!
Bro that was unreal!
I'm lucky to listen to Ren at the perfect moment, when Hi Ren was recently released. Now, this masterpiece matches perfectly in this Rens World 🤘🏼🎶
Wow, as always: you never know what to expect and never get disappointed! Thank you Ren and everyone involved in making MG3.
Can’t wait to rinse the album tomorrow!
... I mean... This is my new favorite song
Is this recorded in a pigfarm? If you look at the ground this could well be a farm.
💗💗💗
❤
Oof
Absolutely incredible brother! This is true art just like all your videos and I’m very glad I’m alive during this period in history to be able to witness it! Keep up the amazing and inspiring content!
I just saw this at school  I don’t think I can continue my day normally after this 🫡👏👏
wow!
Unsigned in the spotlight, Rens Money Game part 3 takes the stage, A premiere like no other, a sensation of our social media age. Unique and special, a talent so rare, Generational brilliance, beyond compare.   Rens style, it has a place in our hearts,  And this is a performance that truly sets him apart. Rens, a talent that will forever shine,   He created a money game community, not just his but yours and mine  In the world of product placement,   replacing our entertainment.  I want to say Thank You to Ren, I can't wait for the next drop so we can do it all again.
Another piece of music history. Ren you fuckin lad. ❤
Boom
Weegie
Complete standing ovation from my desk chair, clutching pearls. Thank you Ren for this masterpiece.
Wow!  Incredible.  I'll be watching this so many times.
hol   ly  crap    goosebumps !   GENIUS GENIUS GENIUS !
Money Game Part 1, Part 2, Part 3 - each one different, each stands on its own in artistry and insight, yet bound by the common thematic thread of a message that can't be shouted loudly enough. Outstanding work Ren, thank you!
Been waiting for thissss
Just a work of art, i love it c:
🍋🍋🍋
Excellent!
I just love your work Ren, simple as that. Everything you touch turns into a piece of art
WOW… another FANTASTIC performance. You never disappoint 👏👏👏👏
You can never disappoint
Wow that was something - it’s not only great music, lyrics but also plot, acting and cinematography. Like dude, how are you doing it! Great job - can’t wait to listen the whole album!
I am reflecting simply of the those already stated: a masterpiece of a man reborn to a status and level only obtained by those clearly enticed and embraced by the divine. He will show the world that the music has called, calling, caller to all. Forever a man who speaks to his soul. Forever a man who cannot take without love. We will be forever in his debt and never again shall we question that the game is most impressed.  Thank you my brother for another amazing and incredible piece of art. Much peace and love to you! ^^ <3
Omg
Bloody hell. Speechless....
❤❤❤
It's fucking here! Let's gooo!!
Wow... powerful and made me cry! You are brilliant!
My mouth still open for few minutes after that end!
Un altro capolavoro……quest’Uomo sarà celebrato come il più grande Artista di tutti i tempi.
Damn?I am speechless! Another brilliant and profound song! I love these sequels or trilogy-style tunes
Holy shit
Money game part two was amazing and this is just a step above, For my final Drama piece for school I did a slam poem rendition of part 2!
Beautiful my friend!! Can't wait to see what's next!
Just WOW
This is a Masterpiece for sure!!!
holy crap ren has done it again
Another powerful message! Thank you Ren for your gift ❤
i was here
Wow what an incredible piece of art - who would’ve thought it could actually hold up to the hype - but by damned if it didn’t just blow all my wildest expectations and hopes for it outta the water. Wow, gotta go watch it a few more times. Amazing work Ren, Sam, and everyone involved. ❤
Just sit back and enjoy! Thanks brother :)
The trust Ren had that the guy was going to be behind him with the chair was strong 😂😂 5:19
Ren does it again.
Oh, let’s go!!!!!!  ❤
That was absolutely epic!! My heart is still pounding! Ren and crew you are genius! 🖤
Wow
Damn, I found your music a couple of weeks ago and fell in love immediately. You made me rethink what my life values are.
Ren,  you're bringing it.. and you're earning it.. you're playing very well ..in this , money game...❤
Astonishing.  Bravo to all involved in its creation.
Absolutely beautiful Ren!
What a message.
Well done Ren fella 👏
Luigi would be proud.
Also just amazing camera work from Sam! How the scenery changed constantly and the camera worked its way smoothly through the room. Ren and Sam are reaching astonishing levels of creativity together.
Wow! You two need to start making movies. This is just WOW!
Brilliant
ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING ! A MASTERPIECE 💪👏👏👏 Probably my favourite vid/song/play so far by miles wow ❤
You are a genius! A masterpiece.....you tell the real life.....
Incredible ❤❤❤
Wow 🥰🥰🥰
This is the art we have been missing and have come to love with Ren. Money Game parts 1 2 and 3 are pure genius with more meaning about money and greed than any book. All 3 of these need to be played in every economics college class.
wow
Still haven't managed to regulate my breathing...that was outstanding...speechless
In awe; incredible storytelling. You're out there in your own lane Ren. Amazing work from Sam & the team!
Incredible
I can't wait for the album to arrive tomorrow!
That was incredible!! Storytelling was BANANAS!! And the camera work and creativity was CRAZY!! This is a homerun!! Big ❤️ to Ren and Sam!!✌️❤️🫡
Ren I want to tell u this is a masterpiece I can't wait to see the reactions and learn more about it and u look very handsome suit suit u😊 🥰bravo Renee 👏 ❤
The world needs more Rens ❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I really didn’t know what to expect but you have surpassed anything I could’ve imagined.  🤯 ❤🎉
Damn
Incredible one take video and message ...... Iconic
Also, we cannot forget about Sam and EVERYONE  who is involved and behind Ren helping to further the message. Cheers to all of you legends!
Genius
Ren is not wise beyond his years. He is 33 years old. We should all be so wise at that age. If we were, Ren would not have to carry so heavy a burden. I thank god that we have Ren, but I wish to god that we didn't need him.
Art and wisdom.
Superb ❤
Brilliant
Simply amazing bro. What a talent you have...
Another masterpiece needing many, many views and listens.  I can hardly wait to watch the scramble of reactors looking to comment on this, too. Fabulous.
Ren you have moved me from start to finish but this tops it all. You should be fucking proud of this man. ❤ such inspiring and beautiful stuff ❤️
The ending of part 3 looping into the chorus of part 1 literally gave me goosebumps. Amazing work as always!
Nothing like unexpected Ren to improve your day.
fkn gold m8
Not what I expected but I like it.  I can't stop watching this and the reactors.
Support Ren ❤❤❤
I have never heard or seen anything like this. Incredible work from everyone involved! Propably my favorite Ren video!  This is insanely good with an important message!
Well this left me absolutely speechless. Pretty sure my brain reset itself to factory settings while I was just sat there with a whole lot of "what?" I really like this. Just amazing. Genius really. What an artist, what a team. So much happening and I don't think I blinked once. Ok, maybe I'm not speechless. I just don't have the words to explain how this makes me feel.
fuck that was so good man.
Boy. You and Samuel just keep doing it. Incredible
Outstanding.
This is cinema-quality art!  Worth more than any Oscar or Grammy could measure!  I watched this while at work, will be thinking about it all day, will delve back into it tonight, then watch all the reactors get blown away.  Best cinematographer:  Samuel Perry-Falvey.  Best actor:  Ren Gill.  Best score:  Ren Gill.  Best production peeps:  Ren's Friends and The Secret Garden Party
Unbelievable effort put into this song and music video. A masterpiece and nothing less!
Omg!  that was beautiful 🎉🎉🎉
there are so many things to say about this and i can't think straight enough to do so right now.  so amazing.  congratulations to everyone involved in this.  it's just so fantastic.  i will have to watch this a good 20 more times today.
All I can say is wow. It truly is a masterpiece 🖤
❤❤ Ofmg I forgot to blink!!! Don't take this the wrong way, but I'm so glad your big label fell through. Your music, thoughts & words are so needed right now in this world of humans, but IDK if a big label would've supported this needed challenge on perspective. Ren, you are amazing. I was introduced to you through HI REN. I related to your video in such an emotional way. I think we all did. It felt like you were sharing  your soul with us. Thank you, Katheryn
Fuck, I love Ren!!!!
Ren, honestly you inspire people like myself to do better ♥
I'm going to borrow from a play by Oscar Wilde ... "I hope I shall not offend you if I state quite openly and frankly that you seem to me to be in every way the visible personification of absolute perfection"
Dropped the catchy hooks of the previous songs and went more cinematic. A slight step back in one sense but a big step forward if Ren's goal is still to land a cinematic series on netflix or similar streamer. I think subverting the expectation of a catchy tune was the point when he said "This is not entertainment."
Oh god. He did it again.
Great message, can’t stop watching it! ❤
Stunning, I have no words!
Ren - keep it up, the world needs voices like yours! Also your videographer is cracked.
Got chills ….
Ren and Sam... EPIC! All your hard work has paid off. You are truly more than a musician and a videographer... you are both ARTISTS! Masters of Art! Thank you for sharing this with the world!  Edited for spelling
Wow! So moving. Your ability to tell a story but wrap it with universal lessons is amazing.
Wow!
I'm now busy picking up my pearls that I clutched so hard. This is beyond amazing. Thank you
Even the countdown made this even better🔥🔥 i look forward to the reacters👍🙏✌️
That was amazing a piece of art. It moved me to tears and frustration
Ren does it again. Listen, watch and learn.
M i n d b l o w n 💥
Pure brilliance! I'm speechless and I'm deeply moved❤❤❤
No way was that 9 minutes long , what a work of art- I’m so happy tonight 😊
The best video of all time one of your best to date love ya
10 minutes of my life felt like 2 minutes. Can't get over how incredibly well written and directed this whole piece of art. You are writing your name in history books my lad.
Wow
Omg!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
I'm so proud of you
Leaving a comment for the algorithm. Art
Algorythmic bump

🔥🔥🔥
Well done Ren brilliant ❤❤❤❤

Crazy good peice man
I wish Terry Hall was still around to see what you’re doing. I know he would be chuffed. x
I'm speechless. Bravo!
Fucking CLASSSSS
One word, Brilliant!!!!!
Phenomenal. No other words for it.
That’s fuckin deep. Next level 💚
Yup. That was brilliant.
Bravo - I wrote this word and then couldn't decide how to continue: not by chance then, that the next video came up - 'Why' by Supaman. All I can say is that I hope Netflix has been knocking on your door. Ren and Sam are a team that are so unique. Congratulations, I mean over 15, 000 watching! Keep safe, and after all the drama of the last few days do something nice for yourself ☮
Jeez! That was a stunning way to convey a powerful message. You all pulled off something phenomenal here.
Money pt 3 = Art with a message.  Fantastic concept
I really hope for piano notes damn
Damn, Ren!!! This is insane 🔥🔥🔥
Love the nod to Wish You Were Here.
I am out of superlatives - I love this man!
Holy shit that was awesome!!!
3X Awesome  !! Let's go 🔥🔥🔥
I can't even begin to describe how incredibly moving this is.   Damn.
Exceptional work guys! Where was Knox?
Incredible. Fabulous story telling love it ❤
Ren, this is MINDBLOWING!!! The best thing I have watched and heard in a very long time! As a teacher, I will include your song in my lessons❤
Absolut SICK 👏👏👏👏❤
This is quite seriously one of the greatest things I’ve ever heard. The way you write this song forces listeners to hear the lyrics and what story is being told. It’s a complete departure from the previous songs. The other two were comparatively upbeat, but this one is just a swarm of emotion that won’t stop coming. Massive, MASSIVE round of applause to you. Have fun making history dude
I dont know what I was expecting for money game 3 but DAMN, this was FROM ANOTHER WORLD I honestly am in absolute shock on how well this all was made and turned out.. This man is an absolutly beautiful soul and I think that we all should understand his message..   I also wanted to thank ren in specific because he changed my life in a way I could have never tought was even possible, of course other things souch as professional help helped a lot but he was one of the reasons I even started making sessions in the first place.. Today if I think that if  I know something about life is all thank to him.    Truly thank you, Ren, you blessed my sould and helped me find POUPOSE, I will never be able to thank you enough.
❤❤❤
great to see ren finally got to off himself as he said he originally planned that for "Hi ren" :)  but jokes aside, very good and capsulating, like a mixture of all the styles he has done previously
You're a living legend. I'm blown away by this one, the movements were so impressive and unpredictable, you're really at your best when you're experimental. These are ideas that have been touched upon many times before but the way you process and express them is so unique and hauntingly beautiful. Your grasp and expression of complex concepts and drive to improve things is really inspirational. Hope the track and the album do really well, love you! ❤
You sir, are one talented individual.
I can't imagine these stories of yours not making it to Broadway in some way in the future. You don't write raps or poetry, you write musicals.
uve had the biggest impact of any artist ever on my life
Absolutely beautiful way to wrap it up, the treasure hunt was perfect the whole bit was just amazing… Ren I love the way your mind works and the song was truly incredible
Just sitting here in awe.  Ren, you bloody did it again. Created a masterpiece. It is a privilige to be alive in the same century to witness this live. Thank you to everyone who was involved in making the music video. I loved every second
That was dark in the best way.
Unreal absolutely unreal wow
Please include the countdown in the final video cuz it was just too good for anyone to miss. Brilliant
Gave me chills again Ren! Your storytelling is amazing dude
Amazingly ironic. Said with love
Ren again ..twice in a day with such a powerful message ....I just hope it reaches the right people ...again your wisdom shines and it is gold ....
Wow❣🤯💜
Wunderkind of masterclass
😮 Wow!! 👏 👏 ❤
What way to have the 7 days buildup and having this work of art in the end!!!! All fits so well together. The world needs more people like Ren! What a ride it was indeed!!!🐷🐷🐷
Part 3 let's gooo!
wait what... im so early?? wtf.  edit: songs good as hell btw
You are amazing
Beautyfull
As many before me have already said, even so close to this dropping, it's clearly another masterpiece from @RenMakesMusic. It was never in any doubt. Such a joy to have discovered this ride....
There are no words Ren. The depth, the insight, the genius. In this darkness , you speak truth. Thank you for your gift to this world !
So, apparently our boi is not f#*@ing around. He truly intends to change the world. Just genius. I wish we could nominate a Brit to run for President
FIRST TIME I SAW HI REN.....I THOUGHT HOW LONG WILL IT BE BEFORE, NOT JUST EMINEM BUT ALSO, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY.... LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA IS KNOCKING ON REN'S DOOR. THIS CONFIRMS IT EVEN MORE FOR ME.  BIG UP TO SAM........BEAUTIFUL...AND TO ALL REN'S TEAM...LOVE TO YOU ALL FOR THE RIDICULOUS AND EXHAUSTING AMOUNT OF HARD WORK THAT HAS GONE INTO MAKING THIS HAPPEN :).
How is every single one of your songs an absolute masterpiece
Just beyond incredible!!!! Well done!!!!
Genius, pure genius... never been rocked this way by music. Thank you for a gift. ❤
Well!  What to say.  I don't think I took a breath through the entire piece. Brilliant in so many ways.   The story/lyrics, the performance, the filming.   Congratulations on another masterpiece!   ❤❤ Oh and your ability to take on a character....riveting.  You are a shapeshifter for sure.
The best ren song in a while. Fucking love it. Keep it up man❤️
Never have I clicked so fast! One of my High school students introduced me to your music years ago with Money Game pt. 2; I've used several of your songs to connect with students since! Much love and appreciation to you Ren!
And here I am again... swimming in deep thoughts, courtesy of Ren. Thanks mate, love your art.
I`ve just watched the premiere... and I am still speechless.... That was incredibly good! From the concept, to the lyrics, the videographer, the team... Congratulations to all of you. That´s a piece of art.

Brilliant
Everything about this video is captivating from the timing, the visuals. even the breathes he takes are in time, such a great artist.
I love how theatrical ren is
Again bringing the unexpected and leave us speechless after another piece of art. Thank you for your tireless work and dedication to bring us one masterpiece after the other. Oh and did I forget to mention you are enlighting us, the flock of sheep
Damn Son what the hell did i just watch, is there no end to your genius? That was immensely provocative and undeniably thought-provoking. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Renvolution-! 🖤🤭🏴🏳️‍⚧️🖤Ⓐ Fighting for the change we want in the world and care it needs x ❣️ appreciate your message sm.
The element of Stanley in there with the piano was instantly recognisable to me. This whole thing brought me to tears
Outstanding! The hard work, the effort, the effect, everything. Congratulations to all involved. You should be so proud
THIS 🔥🔥🔥
❤
WOW!!! Just WOW!!!!!
That was amazing and touched my heart. Thank you Ren, you are great. Keep on doing what you do. Much love from germany. ❤

Excellent.
A simple but effective way to highlight your message.  Well done to everyone involved and to everyone who took part in this adventure.  It was well worth the wait.  Congratulations Ren the track is powerful and to the point.  Fantastic cinematography from Sam.  Love this.  ❤❤❤ ❤🙌🙌🙌🙌👏👏👏👏👏🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
yes!
I cannot express how much your music has impacted my life. As someone who lives with chronic illness, PTSD from being on life support in a coma and many others, it is what gets me by everyday. This video and song are absolutely brilliant. You're not just a musician, you're a truth teller. You see the difference between the real world and the facades. I cannot thank you enough for giving myself and many others an outlet to get through some of these difficult times. Much love and respect. You deserve all of the love and recognition that youve been receiving. ❤
Well done Ren 🎉🎉🎉
Omg amazing 🎉🎉
🎉 pure artistic beauty, love it
King Ren🤴
fantastic :)
Wow…
🖤Use me as a REN'S HANDS MAKE MY OVARIES HURT button, and let's bump the algorithm. 🖤
Phenomenal work of art
As someone who works professionally in the field of "fine art"... It is so refreshing to see REAL ART that actually offers something of true value! Thank you for being you , Ren!
Just the camera work and the transition into each scene is driving me absolutely nuts. And it's all .... luxury.
DAMN THAT'S...  That's exactly why I learned english. Because of artists like that.  ...  That was too good for my brain, I was tired and now I'm awakenin' Even after all the things that I saw Deaths and conflict, rise and profit,  I got no words at all for these stages Those who look not like real life but who are real life After all, I'm just a lazy, lazy little guy Some people make things, some are happy Some are pressing on the trigger of the money game...  And then there's him. And someone other.  And I don't know what to say.  And I don't know who I am.
R you not teaching the vunrable  to shoot themselves.
Masterpiece!!!!
Sick Boi being played on 6 Music on Monday and this masterpiece on Thursday, what a week for Ren & his fans!💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
I was panting after this. I just heard my breathing and wondered how a video can do that to me. 15'000 people were watching this live. I really hope this wasn't the pinnacle yet. But it kinda scares me what else is coming from this man.
Wow! Not sure how I'm feeling right now... but i like it... ty again
Been on tenterhooks all day waiting and it was soooo worth the wait. Love it!!!!!
Re-re-watching!
Shaken! Thank you for the beautiful art.
This was well worth waiting for ,every new thing ren does my levels of amazement just get higher pure legend man ,I need to get those albums.
This is amazing. Just, such a great job. 10/10
Wow...what a masterpiece, it was so unique and profound. I have no other words right now, till I fully process what I've just witnessed. Congratulations Ren, you wasn't wrong, best yet.✌❤
GOOSEBUMPS, i have no words, whatever good words i use to describe this won't do it justice...just, i'm so happy and grateful to know you and listen to you as an artist and i just hope you continue gifting us such precious art and experiences
We started out first by watching a conceert, then it turned into a play and then it ended like a movie. WTF lol. Ren, you are absolutley amazing brother! Much love!
i was here !
Amazing as always!
@Ren  https://media.tenor.com/Sq7rY9NKKd4AAAAM/oscars-standing-ovation.gif
Alright this song is art.
Class 😎
Jimmy lives in all of us 😥 sadly
A lot different then I expected and returning to more of a freestyle like the first money game. It is a great lesson in greed being our downfall but human nature is to want more. Utopian society would be great but until machines do all the work, people that work harder or risk their lives or study for years expect to live better for doing so. Most jobs aren't done because they enjoy it, it's because it allows them to live better. If all jobs paid the same, who would want to do the dangerous jobs when they could do something simple and safe instead?  We've created a society where entertainment tends to pay the most because so many people want escapism and where people throw their money, greed will find a way to capitalize, such as companies advertising.  To go to a money free system would revert us back to bartering which is still the same problem.. utopian socialism is the only escape but that's not in human nature because again all jobs are not equal
REN, you just outdid yourself! 🥹👏👏👏❤️‍🔥 Thank you for everyone who was involved to make this happen with Ren! 🥹 The Bard has shown again how storytelling is done masterfully, bardcore at it's best 🔥 putting the mirror at ourselves ❤️‍🔥
LITERALLY KILLED IT.
This is the definition of art.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ren, thank you for everything!!! Lov you❤
Incredible 😮😍
THats not only a Masterpiece... Its THE Masterpiece!!
That was an even shorter 9 minutes than Hi Ren. Absolutely brilliant!
Well this didn't disappoint. Absolute masterpiece. This is art, a performance, a message, a story and much, much more. Another fantastic one take video too. ❤
A masterpiece ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Brilliantly amazing.💜
That was the best birthday present a girl could ask for! Amazing concept put together flawlessly! ❤🔥❤🔥❤🔥
You've only gone and done it again Boi, that was awesome. Glad I was here with the rest of your Renegades to see it first!
I believe in Ren
Well that more than exceeded the hype by a long way... absolutely incredible work ❤❤❤
Absolute masterpiece. From every word to every shot scene in one take. The movements of people to the rain dropping to the actual story telling bringing it to life.  Thank you Ren, Sam and team for the most influential art I’ve ever seen.  Last two hours have blown my mind.
so fucking good
You are such a beautiful human!! You are exactly what the world needs right now!! And kudos to Sam and the rest of the team for the incredible cinematography ❤
Incredible video
Well done Ren and Sam.. knocked it out the park!.. again!  Amazing! ❤
this needs to sink in 🤯
LETS FUCKING GOOO
So nice to hear someone say it instead of downplay it ✌️
#RENVOLUTION
Simply wow ! Shout out to everyone who worked on this piece ❤
today is the day of me being dehydrated from crying, what did i just witness???????? HISTORY WRITTEN IN FRONT OF MY EYES???? This was amazing, Sam out did himself with the camera work, i didnt even think he could. How much time and effort into achieving this perfectly choroegraphy that touched my soul. Love you Ren, im so proud of you, seeing all you have created in this few weeks, completely madness. Im speechless honestly, but you should learn how to fold clothes tho
Pure art, beautiful done and so poignant ❤❤❤
huh, you touch so many souls🧑‍🤝‍🧑👩🏻‍🤝‍👩🏼👫👬🧑‍🤝‍🧑👩🏻‍🤝‍👩🏼👫👬🧑‍🤝‍🧑👩🏻‍🤝‍👩🏼👫👬
I'm speechless. When you were humming at the start of the video it looked like Violet's Tale's melody, that hit hard
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
My heart started pounding when I saw what was on the table.   My 3 year old died that way.   My father-in-law loves money. It's the sole direction he ever gave my husband.   None of us speak to him anymore. He decided his power and wealth exempted him from practicing common sense. He left one loaded where our boy could reach it.   His corruption is doing him in, slowly. His wife left him, deciding no life with him was worth the cost to self.   He's on the brink of losing his home, along with the business properties he's already lost.  The man sold his soul.   I've watched this play out in real life, too close to home.
Holy!!   This is amazing!!   I just finished watching and I’m left speechless, again.   Ren, this is a true masterpiece or masterpieces!!!
Wow...dark...like the times we are living in. Well done, Ren.  A work of artnwith such an important message.  Let us all be the change ❤
Everything thing about this from the lyrics to the video definitely deserves it's own award ceremony. This isn't just music it's an perfectly performed modern day Shakespeare
Just... Thank you! 🙏❤️
WOW 🤩 stunning work, Ren. You must feel so proud of this, you’re allowed to feel proud and own that ❤️
There is nothing like Ren! 😮 That was incredible !
Masterpiece fella. Stop it, I'm running out of superlatives!!
~Utterly amazing,   You makemee think, laugh cry, every emotion, you hit ever nail's head. thanyou Ren x
Ren you are the perfect mirror -  therefor a true artist.
Art reflecting truth.
I haven't welled up from one of your songs since For Joe. You hit the nail on the head every damn time, dude. I know you are super proud of this and you should be. What a rollercoaster.
This is fucking FIRE!!! Well done Ren and crew!!!
So visually stunning and incredibly compelling storytelling once again...stunned silence is all I can muster at the moment but I'm sure I'll be back for another watch (or 20) soon ❤
Ren's storytelling videos are so captivating 😮
Generational talent Ren! Congratulations. Thanks for bringing us into your world. Entertainment and art with strong messages and philosophy. Super rare and much needed!
I hope you'll upload the countdown video, it deserves to live on on YouTube as well 🎸
that custom premiere countdown was epic.
Well done, for real!
So dope Sick Boi!
This is as riveting as “Hi “Hi Ren” emotionally compelling and so true.  You were right,  it’s another masterpiece and you delivered. There will never be another Ren. Thank you Ren for this absolute gift you’ve given us.  We love you as though you are our personal friend   ❤
This is ART! ❤
So brilliantly done!  Rain has come this way for certain.
Well then, that was something special!
Hands down, absolutely brilliant!!!! I got chills that compare to when I first saw you in Hi Ren.
Thanks
Holy shit!
Were parasites in side a petridish  With cannibal minds Mould grows upon a surface it consumes till it dies
It's hard to pick a favorite when it comes to Ren's music. But this is easily my favorite video. Holy shit.
Awesome! You‘re Opus magnum.
Absolutely amazing. Now I'm going to sit by my letterbox until my Sick Boi CD comes! 😁
fire as always- the only thing i don't understand is why Ren makes absolute anticapitalist bops like this and then writes long ass community posts about how he's not a socialist, like bro you keep writing based song trashtalking capitalism, just come join us comrade
I don't usually comment on videos, but without a doubt this has to be an exception. This is an absolute fucking masterpiece mate. Hopefully with more people like you we can change this twisted, messed up world and be free from the greed and lies that society has seemed to come to worship. All I can say really is thank you for creating this song, and helping to spread your message. Thank you!
WOW!!!!!!!!
This hits so hard in so many ways.  I left my job because of my health and have been going crazy because I am not making money. I keep chasing it ( been working since I was a kid)and this video just made me open my eyes and realize I shouldn't be going just to make money but just cover my medical bills.
Ren that was amazing. We can all relate. We all need to escape our conditioning.  We usually only realise we have been conditioned when things go wrong sadly.  Masterpiece! 💚🕊💚
Speechless except for holy shit and wow and mad respect
Masterpiece!
Bravo! Fxcking powerful!
The ending was perfect.
Banger as always, big W❤‍🔥
Wow
I'm gonna need a few replays to filter my thoughts on this one
its finally here
Absolutely outstanding!
Ren you are a genius my friend.
Bravo
🔥💯🔥
Awesome! 🔥
Powerful shit, Ren. Your eyes are wide open. Hoping people like you open up millions of eyes and minds to how the world could be compared to where we are.
Stunning 🔥🔥🔥
He begs of us, all of us..... We must do better, we must be more. More for each other ❤ Thank you for caring so much, Ren 🫂
I need to catch my breath after this, hahaaah
Your music has helped me.
Ren is Genius.  The Ren-aissance is in full flow turned up to 11.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Holy. Fuck.
Incredible. Congratulations to you both and the entire team and crew.
"Awe" in its traditional meaning translates to "fear" I'm in awe of this art, because all important changes inspire fear.  This was tragic in its magestic beauty. Never let your vision stop. We are the tide that can change so much. Thank you Ren.  All my love from far away ❤
By this point you can't outdo yourself, nor can you set the bar any higher.
❤❤❤❤
That was fucking incredible. Absolute masterpiece!
Beautiful
Masterpiece, holy shit.
I bloody love it! But I hope no ren's where harmed in the making of that video 🫣 OMG!
Thank you  Ren.
Speechless mate. I think I need to see it a couple dozen of times to get every detail I want to acknowledge but I loved it. It's powerful, meaningful and always very deep and kind of overwhelming. You're a master at your craft. Thank you so much for the art. I'll go watch it again now ❤  P.S. please don't ever load a gun and squeeze the trigger while doing a one shot video EVER AGAIN, the shivers bro !
Never disappointed when listening to a Ren original
Ren, Ren, Ren, Ren ❤❤❤❤
OK Mind blown once again.  Instant rewatch!!!!
They want us to be sheeps, we know who they are, but we are still the sheeps. 😢
Brilliant, can't help but wonder how much of this "epic saga" was envisioned when money game part one was written🤔
Chills from start to finish. What a masterpiece!!
This was amazing, one of the best masterpieces I've ever heard
Can't believe that was 9 minutes it felt like a moment...
This is amazing.
Holy fucking shit!!!!!!!! That's Insane!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow. That was amazing!
Brilliant!!! So looking forward to the album.
Man...I have no words...this is...breathtaking. He was right. This is the best thing he's ever done. He's learned so much by now...boy. this is art. For real. This is life. Man. Thank you
Incredible. Genius, art, truth - an anthem for our time ❤️Thank you Ren, Sam, all involved.
Blown my mind twice today.
I have no words. Your music, your art, the camera work, all this is brilliant. But it's sooo much more. It speaks out of my soul. I'm stunned!
That was the single most amazing thing I have EVER seen. I am speechless
Bro this is amazing
Ren, this was astounding. Epic. Cinematic. Amazing to see where your inspiration has taken you. If this is a taste of the art you have yet to bring us I am a fan for life. Bring it on.
Fuc£ing hell!! What did I just watch? Truly amazing!!! Thank you ❤
CHILLS!!! Speechless. I feel like i just left the movie theater after watching an epic movie based on true events. Only Ren and Sam could make that happen under ten minutes. We must protect these people at all cost. Cheers x
I’m shook 🤯 Not even sure what to say right now. Maybe I will come back later to write something more intelligent 😅 For now all I can say is that if Netflix doesn’t give you your own show, they’re 100% stupid 😂 Masterpiece 🐐🐰🕳️
this is awesome
WHAT AN INSANE MASTERPIECE 😮❤ . Never cease to surprise me or amaze me Ren I don't know why you have not always been in my life ..😮
Incredible masterpiece Ren. You always know how to reach deep into the soul and change our own perspective. Thank you, so much love for you mate 💚
Incredible! ❤❤❤
I just LOVE your creativity, truly a blessing see it play out in real life Ren ❤
Profound & brilliant! Congratulations on another masterpiece Ren & Sam!! Much love x
You did it again - what a MASTERPIECE - thank you, Ren...😔 ...and it's like I still feel the apple sticking in my throat
Great video,  great everything
Don't do it Jimmy😢
Wow you never cease to amaze!❤
🔥 🔥🔥 👏 👏👏
Fuck my boots that was powerful bruv spreading that far and wide
That was intense....
Wow, I am speechless. This just brings it all together so masterfully - everything that is Ren and his message and all his skills. I still have chills.
Holy god, that was brilliant and beautiful. The contents of your mind are a delight to behold. Well done on another masterpiece, Ren 😊❤
This level of production and music and the way its combined together is indescribably good. The message that this piece of art tells really needs to be told.
Magnificent
👏👏👏👏👏👏
Well if that doesn't start conversations I don't know what will. Brilliantly done Ren and Sam! 👏👏👏
Oh damn!  I didn't expect MG3 to go for Tales of Jenny and Screech style. BUT this could had been the part 4 of tales as well.   I have to listen to the Spotify version also, but for now not a jam that I would listen all the time but it is one that I would suggest everyone to watch.  Brilliant cinematography. Compared to old videos, Sam&Ren really really improved!!! Fucking brilliant ❤
whoa!
I’ve been waiting for part 3 for ages and let me tell you, it did not disappoint. ❤
Fucking hell.. fucking hell.. fucking hell.. Awesome Ren!!!
Wow wow wow...!  You never disappoint Ren..Thank you for being you..!  Big hugs to you and your amazing team ..!  Masterpiece.! X
So much better than I hoped.
Absolutely 🌋🌋🌋
And round and round we go, and where it stops nobody knows....unless we stop it
Speechless, tears, mesmerized, goosebumps... Fuck... This is madness and art at its finest 🐷💲🔥
M A S T E R P I E C E. Ren Never Misses
Masterpiece in so many levels! Big up from Finland!
I’m speechless ❤
I have to wait for my partner to get home to watch this together and the anticipation is kiillllling me I am so flipping excited
Masterpiece!  Absolutely no one else doing this! Ren is next level!
He pressed on the trigger of a money game.
I'm already insanely obsessed with this song, holy sh*t.  Such a beautiful song with an incredibly important message!
This man is talented
Watching that live, I was frozen.
Incredibly ambitious piece of filmmaking 👏That Netflix series feels within Reach!
Amazing work
Powerful message.   These one shot vids tie my brain in knots. Legend.
Thank you for making greed a sin again.
Yeeeew have been waiting a long time for this! Great stuff Ren
Whoah 😮
No words here. None needed. Just 👏👏👏👏👏👏
That was pure art. That was rough and intense as hell. Human creation is sometimes awesome. Thanks mate
This is exactly why I decided to stop chasing money and to seek education. I make just enough to live and the rest goes to more education. Money feels so dirty and this is the only way I've found that feels ok
That was brilliant!
Holy hell.  When I thought I was ready because I had cleared my mind of all expectations... I still wasn't ready.
REN✨ MASTERPIECE!🎶🔥😉🫶🏽
Not what I expected, but somehow that is what I expected from Ren. Goosebumps over here… loved every second of it
Ffwc. Blydi amazin’.

Geez goosebumps. What a gift you are, Ren. I hope your message sinks in for a few. ❤️
Love it! Great performance! Great message!
SickBoi, sick boy, looking for a fix, boy. Don't go for the gun. There's treasure everywhere and we can share.
Wow, I need a rewatch but we all know we'll rewatch this 45 times minimum
Fanfuckingtastic
i'm convinced that you're actually an author but your books didn't sell because most people don't really read any more and you had to find another way to tell the stories
🍋🍋🍋❤
I see a little René Magritte in here.
Another masterpiece
This was insanely good 🖤
Symphonic, Operatic, Provocative, Inspirational: Ren

My son woke me up saying it is MG3 day. I responded "finger on the trigger"...didn't realize that would be the ending. Well done Ren!
Fantastic Amazing.  The best yet. Turned up to 11. Worth the wait.❤❤

My mind was fried for a little bit when it started raining 😂🔥🔥🔥
Speechless. What a message, told through a story we all know but avoid facing. Ren you are unf#uckingbelievable ❤
They're going to have to invent some new words, because I keep saying the same ones "brilliant" "masterpiece" "ground breaking" but each thing you do is better than the last. I've topped out on complimentary words.
Wow this is not what i expected, i expected a money game part 3 like 1 and 2. but instead we got this a masterpiece, the lifestory of jimmy. AMAZING
Perfection,there are no other words to describe that 💔❤️💔
I think I stopped breathing watching in anticipation at points in this song, never a dull moment with anything from ren.
Masterpiece, Art, Theater, Music... crazy ❤
Fuçk that was 🤯
Wow! That's all I can say right now
Amazing ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Once again Ren, you have outdone yourself and proved how much the world, the society needs you as an artist. Respect.
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu*k 😮🫣 Ren just keeps outdoing himself. Incredible ❤
At the same time what I expect and not what I expected.

Bloody hell 😮👏🏻 I was worried that this had been built up too much. Could it really live up to expectations? Well? The answer is no - it’s so much better!Completely blown away with how brilliant it is in every way.   Also have loved the Magritte paintings since I was a teenager.  Now Ren brings them to life ❤️

Chills dude, loved it. Thanks so much for making people take a step back and look at this all from another perspective. ❤
This is both art and a message.  Somthing only ren could do.
Speechless
Youtube needs to create a fuckin 'Auto-like' for Ren. Knocked it out of the park again lad. Love it.
this was so powerful. not only toxic masculinity but a poetry on war and money making taking over our lives. it's amazing shit man, keep up the work
Wow 😮 That's deep.
Holy Hells!
Brilliant, just simply brilliant!! Thank you Ren, for sharing your wisdom with all!
holy crap this is amazing.
Ok Ren you are so real for this one
❤
Speechless ,wow
The timing of this video, given all that's happening in the world right now. I hope it inspires people to just take a minute to think for a moment.
Bloody brilliant Ren!
Wow. I mean just wow. I've made this comparison to a lot of my friends when talking to them about Ren, and it only holds more true at the moment. This feels like being there for the Sermon on the Mount. Actually, after the last 10 months, it feels a lot more like being there every step of the way. from miracle to miracle. Sermon to Sermon. Maybe it's time for us to change. I don't think the voice in the wilderness could get any clearer. Thank you, Ren. Sincerely. Thank you.
Wow. Incredible art💚!
This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen.
I AM NOT WELL AFTER THIS. BRILIANT !
Wow. Just wow
Fuck!!! Omg my heart was going like crazy! No words but genius!!! 🔥🔥🔥❤

My second ever album 'Sick Boi' is out now! https://bio.to/Ren-Sick-Boi  As always here are the lyrics for anyone who wants them!  Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy 1 years old and his first words were "Mine, mine, Gimmie!" 2 years old he was walking, 3 years old walking quickly  4 years old he was running round the pavements of the city   5 years old and his daddy told him "listen here son, You Gota learn to be a man a man he works for what he wants" 6 years old and he’s reading, writing top of the bunch And when he’s 7 his progression made him student number 1 8 years old and he’s praised for unusual grades 9 his parents pay for private school to nurture the flame  10 11 12 13 he ascends and ascends His daddy tells him "son,  money is the means to all ends"  14 solving complex mathematic equations  15 I.Q one hundred and fifty still elevating 16 he develops complex software code That detects weaknesses in cyber security protocols 17 and he sells vision keeping a share  not yet an adult but he's practically a millionaire, 18 and his daddy tells him "now your a man This world don't give a damn about you so take all that you can" 19 he turns a profit stocks and shares invest in product 20 double down deposits 21 his income rockets 22 he learns that truth is just an obstacle to wealth If you manipulate the data then a lie will sell itself 23 a life of luxury crystal and cocaine, 24 he made the Forbes list they're applauding his name 25 and his daddy tells him "listen here son While ur sitting in your Palace, that don't mean that you won" 26 a business shift he switches business to arms 27 dealing nuclear and shells in Iran 28 inside the sennet money bought him a seat 29 a role of council in the president sweet  Now he’s 30 and his daddy says "you're loosing the race You're just a servant to the king not even in second place " 31 A big manoeuvre for his daddy’s approval  Moving imports over borders from the exports out of Cuba.  32 moving grams growing kilos to tonnes  (Put down champagne glass 33 filling warehouses with powder and guns  34 Turf war with nobody to stop it  Blind eye from the Po-Po inside of his pocket  35 - and he gets a call, "I’m sorry son But its your father, had a heart attack I’m sorry he’s gone" 36 - getting pissed and abusing his product 37 - eyes glazed, disposition demonic  38 - with a prostitute a moment of passion Heating up a silver spoon and then chasing the dragon 39 - Getting reckless and hungry for power  Daddy’s words still driving him to kill and devour Makes a move against the cartel but the strategies flawed.  ( CARTEL RUNN PAST SHOT/ SMOKE GRENADE? SMOKE MACHINE?) They retaliate and leave him in a hospital ward A bullet buried in the vertebra and one in the leg  The doctor sighs and says I don’t think you’ll be walking again   Let me tell you a story about a boy named jimmy He was 40 and he cursed the words mine mine gimme 41 he wasn’t walking 42, not walking quickly  43 never running round the pavement of his city  44 inside his palace with a mountain of gold But the riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves Weighing heavy on his conscience is the value of gold A Lamborghini for a life, trading money for souls But jimmy followed the code inside the land of the free Put your hand inside the cookie jar take more than you need  And his is example is exaggerated versions of me - [ ] And its a version of him and its a version of she And its a version you there’s no escaping the blame  The way we live is parasitic fuck the money and fame  Cut the music    This ain’t entertainment, this is real life The way we live is lunacy, community it declines Hyperpolerised - always fighting then we divide Truth is less important than the money that we designed?  Moneys an invention, politics from our invention They all come from peoples ideas did I mention Borders our invention Law and order fuel the tension that leads to people killing each other? My solution  Everything is subject to change We can builds Utopias if individuals are taught to use there’s brains But if we teach kids in school to always be sheep And put ourselves before the heard if there’s more money for me   Then there’s no future I see, where the humans survive Were parasites in side a petridish  With cannibal minds Mould grows upon a surface it consumes till it dies And our fate could be the same, so here’s a story for the wise    45 jimmy comes home out of the rain       Soaking wet upon a wheel chair, drinking again  Everything he wants he has fortune and fame He’s a fortunate fool with an unfortunate fate  With a 45 calibre aimed at his brain 45 a fitting number cause his age is same Hears the words of his father; ‘such a damn shame’  Then he presses on the trigger of a money game
That was gripping.
Holey Guacamole Batman!! That was next level.
That gave me the chills
OH MY GOD AMAZING

This is the most epic thing I have ever seen. My god Ren, Sam and others, what have you done. This bar is too high for others to follow. WOWSER. Watched it like 50 times now ands still amazing. But the nice guy in me feels sorry for the female violinist who remained professional whilst getting soaked in the background. I cant unsee it lol. I hope she got a massive thankyou and an Ren apology hug. Hehe
Ren it is on point

Only a couple songs and albums I've ever been this excited for! Thank you Ren for the music you bring into the world for us!  Edit: Chills. This video is a fucking MASTERPIECE. This is just as impactful as Hi Ren and so many others. Ive said it before, but Ren is the most important musician on the planet right now. People NEED to hear this. Wow.
Ren I can't put into words how thoroughly excited I am for this. Definitely the most anticipated release. Part 1 and 2 altered my brain chemistry & I think it would be safe to say that I've never come across such brilliant pieces of art again. Looking forward to another one of your beautiful and thought-provoking contributions to the betterment of the society, and of our world. Gonna stream the hell out of this, fingers crossed.

Hi There Ren ✨
Meeting my musical hero Mike Scott (Waterboys) tomorrow, but what am I more excited for? 😂
I am LOVING this whole concept Ren and guys. This feels like a movement. A way forward, a way out of this almighty mess the world is in today. It starts with a vision. Isn't that how everything starts? A belief that change, REAL change, can and should happen. Well done Ren for making me, a 57 year old Muso, feel alive again!! Thank you.
I'm counting seconds till I can hear another masterpiece from you
Why am I feeling nervous 😂😂😂
💃🕺💃🕺💃🕺
Peace and love Ren!
What a way to start the day❤🎉
good luck for tomorrow :)
❤❤❤❤I can hardly wait wait as the seconds tick 😅❤❤❤❤
❤😮❤😮❤😮❤😮❤😮❤
Sunrise here Waiting in anticipation
I wonder if the final challenge was meant to be a trick or not.  I thought he would want us to burn the money to show we're not greedy - but he might have taken it to be that the money was burned b/c we wanted more money.  I feel like the guy was trying to honor what he thought Ren would want him to do.  So I will be curious to find out what the RIGHT answer was.
Lets go 🔥
Can't wait for this
Really ill right now, this will cheer me up
The game was fun, the lesson was more valuable than gold.
hello MoneyGamers, burn it all !
Can't wait
here doing my civil duty and increasing engagement for the massive superstar Ten you should do the same. Oh and go buy sick boi the album released tomorrow 13/10/23!!!🐷🐷🐷🐷
Can't wait!

So excited for this!!!
Ren, Sam, Vik, Jake and the whole behind team <--- You are brilliant for bringing us so much entertainment and art!
Feels like we've all been a part of history here, Ren.  Other than some lasting trauma over antique slippers that will likely plague me for life, couldn't be happier about being here for this.
So excited for this one! You are making the numbers - so well deserved and so long coming - I hope you take time to breath in this achievement - well deserved and you did it1 I know the strughle has been brutal , take eed in the fact that you are such an inspiration to many! 💝
Oh showing sooo much love! This is going to be epic! Everything you do is epic...on so many levels! I agree with those in the chat who say you should be world president. We need more people like you in every government around the world! Again- thank you. For everything ❤
Great way to promote the album sir! Can’t wait to hear it through! 🫶
Everyone, please try harder to hear this message. Because it seems it is still going over too many people's heads.

Bloody Brilliant!!
Sqweeeeeeeee!  🐷 💖🐷
Very complex indeed
🕊️❣️
🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋
The treasure hunt was amazing! So many things could have gone wrong. I was yelling at my phone. Why don't they listen?
💸🔥💸🔥💸🔥💸🔥
🍋🍋🍋
Oooh, its almost time. We're all part of this old money game.
Can't wait!   :)
3 years after the last one, it better be worth the wait Knowing Ren, he will deliver, I'm certain Edit after watching: I get the message, it's not entertainment, but I'd be damn lying if I said I didn't feel underwhelmed. It just feels like watching a dreamworks trilogy.
We have the option to create heaven or hell. I belive in you too. I belive in us. If we are now in hell - let us "fight" with all the power of light for heaven.... Much Love. One world. One future. And Ren: We are with you.
Leeeeeeetttttttttttssssss goòooooooooooooooooooooòooooo
Thank you for doing the amazing things you do with your visibility.  Thank you for helping "us" feel less lika a big pile of "me"s.
You really have power now, power to be heard, power to initiate change. Scary, exciting. Where will this lead? As Marlowe said in Faustus, hell is empty and all the demons are here. But there is also a Lutheran understanding that you decide your own heaven or hell according to whether you believe you deserve to be in the Light or hide from it. The banishment of Adam and Eve is the hiding from God. All of us can choose, I agree. Look out for yourself.
WOW...under the impression of the EPIC treasure search 🔥🍎❤️ the excitement is expanding...
I'm so impressed at what Ren has built. He got all that publicity and has used it to become so much more. And the music is awesome.   Well done Ren. You remind me of that Scroobius Pip line "Thou shalt not use poetry, art or music to get into girls’ pants - use it to get into their heads"
Been watching you since "Hi Ren".  I think I am almost as excited as you !  I have watched you grow, and I believe you can go as far as you wish.  Hope you are well ❣️🙏🏻❣️
That game was incredibly epic and thought provoking. You, sir, are a genius.
Ren, I hope this finds you. I will probably be attacked for saying this, but I don't care.  Ren, Jesus loves you more than you could possibly imagine or understand. God DID make you broken so that you could thrive, soar & send a message to the world. You were worth dying for.
🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋
I just cancelled a play-date with my 35 year old daughter in favor of Money Game 3 😁.
You are AMAZING Ren!!! Thank you for this gift you have given so many today. Much love to you and everyone here. ❤
Ahhhhh man there's me waiting for 7pm and it's at 8 🫠😔
5am and on the edge of my seat, not sure how to shave cats today, my sea shells have death mittens and teeth that cut like razors,  reflexes are the only thing keeping my finger on the trigger of a money game. Your game keeps us up all night but there is nowhere on earth better to be. I hope you are very proud of what you have done Ren, we admire you and our respect is timeless.
you mad beautiful wise man
Holy shit that stream was beautiful!!!! I can't wait for this video!
Wow, just watching the end game and they lost the lot  - greed!
got me bawlin.  TY Ren
There are no more words to describe how incredible this man is!!! ❤❤❤❤
Quite incredible what you've done here, both in marketing and in generating a worthwhile message.  Funny how that plays right into the dichotomy of the human condition.
🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋
Excited to watch this one .
Damn that treasure hunt ending was intense. Do better because the option exists...
Can't w8
Profoundly effected by the live stream end message, now primed for the impact of this track
That livestream was crazy wow ….
That live got me fired up for this keep speaking truth brother
Can't believe those 2 guys succumbed to greed. What would you guys have done?
The Universe has aligned for your message to come out NOW Ren!!!!
Simply can NOT wait. I would LOVE to see this on a BIG screen.
👌👌👌👌
Here and waiting.
What a fantastically beautiful money game! Thank you REN!
I would follow this guy to the new world 🖤
THAT LIVESTREAM WAS INSANITY
I'm breathless. Thank you.
Wow.
THE MOST ANTICIPADED TRACK OF ALL TIME!! lets gooo ren cant wait to react to this one money game part 1 and 2 were eppic!!!
This is going to be epic. Ren your a good man keep spreading the love. From the Isle of Man peace and happiness brother

Why is everyone posting lemons? 😂
Could it be could it be could it be.....❤
🍋
Can't wait for this one to finally drop today and the album tomorrow. I'm so freaking pumped. Had to get a tattoo with Hi Ren lyrics done today in celebration and I spent the entire time passionately telling the tattoo artist your entire back story and how amazing your music is, how much it means to me and made him promise to listen to your music as soon as he gets home. Praying we got another RENegade! 💖
It’s gunna be live in 2hrs I’m sooooo hyped and excited 😆
Now THIS is exciting
I remember some of the pictures from when this was being filmed and I knew something insane was brewing in the background. So excited to finally get to experience this! 🔥
Found an clip on fb of Ren singing Roxannne. Always hated that song but damn boyyyyyy never blushed so much in my life 😅❤ 😂 thanks for that little gem!
Oh man I am counting down 3 hours I am so excited!
❤❤❤❤❤
3 hours to go man can't wait to hear another piece of rens art ,today I was listening to chalk outlines on repeat it's one of my favourite songs.this guy is a legend man .
Very much looking forward to this. Ren you are wonderfully talented. I too suffer with bipolar /psychosis and spent many months in hospital against my will and am still on a plethora of drugs. I thank God everyday for music like yours, to comfort me, give me courage and remind me I am not alone.
🍋🍋🍋
The pantheon of power personifies the pigs of despised decadence. Yet it is of your brilliance that lies in devotion, a call to arms. One that would make a Heming-weigh out the anchor of those rags to riches stories that insult an intelligence ignorant of many a money game. Now no more shall that be true when we have the RENagades and you. Now as I lay down to rest i await nothing more than the best of the best. Terribly sorry I won't make the premiere but I am listening from the peak of change that the world gets to keep for a penny given is a pound earned forevermore.
Today is the day Ren is conquering the world for good!!! Bring it on 🚀🚀🚀
I’ve been on the edge of my seat waiting for Money Game 3 to drop. So excited. And even more excited for tomorrows album release.
Hi ren been following your music for a little while now just want to say thank you you've gone from bottom (literally) to be spectacular  I don't know how you do it I'm still fighting the days wish I had your strength 5 hrs can't come soon enough your a legend don't know if you will see these comments but if you do I'm glad I found ya music 😊
STOKED AS HELL
I do hope this song blows up. There will be so much truth within the song that people need to hear.  If you can put this song on repeat when it drops at 8pm. Let's get it trending! 👏🏼
6 hours and counting down the minutes
Apparently a winner has been found!
12noon or 12midnight?
🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋 Ren is the greatest example ever of making lemonade out of the lemons you are given. 🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋
8 Hourssssssssssssss 🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋
It's my birthday Ren! Looking forward to this premier as a musical birthday gift from you - to me -  and to the world! Cheers Ren ❤

🍋 So excited for this! 🍋 The MG3 riddles and challenges have been incredible! It’s made the build up to the Sick Boi album release so much fun! Kudos to you and your team or shall we call them your RENposse? 😼 Samuel, Viktus, Joe, Connor, Jake, and everyone in your circle are invaluable ❤ It’s a true testament to what an independent artist with passion, creativity, and hard work can accomplish. I’m so happy to see you finally achieving levels of success that would have seemed unreal just a year ago.
Excited for this, and I’m not working… woo hoo 🎉 🍋🍋🍋❤
🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋
🍋
Hope not too many people are left feeling sour after all the chaos this week🍋 Maybe a new banger will quench their thirst 😆
🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋❤❤❤ . Already know it's gonna be amazing. Highly suspect it might mess me up a bit. Looking forward to both.

Looking forward to it. Feeling little down as the world falls around me 😢
Each day i see more of humanity die, each day the death of society gets closer, the final stages of capitalism are here, as you said bro as the world turns the whole world burns, I don't even know if im depressed any more it's like I don't feel anything, I feel like I died already a long time ago and this is just some sort of afterimage, your songs have always helped man, its like you feel everything I did but decided to let it flow through your art and not hide "yourself" in front of it. Thank you for being human, so that I may relearn, relax, soften and dance.
I seriously, I can't get over this guy. Every song is an amazing everyday common story in real life. Every video has the creative signs of a genius. Im shook every time i come across a ren video
Im so ready to be dissapointed.  I hate every single one of his newer songs and after I saw how he butchered love music, I cant wait to see how he spits of money game's concept.  Treatment must be extreme.
Love you..😊
🤘🏼
Demos, freckled angels, and violets tale cd bundle  came in the mail today!!!!!😊❤ so happy❤❤❤❤ next is SICK BOI ❤❤❤
Today's riddle was great!  Had a lot of fun on Instagram today. All the short videos were amazing. I saw them all! So, yes, it took me quite awhile to get it done, but it was worth it. Can't wait til the next one. I never want this game to end! ❤❤❤
33 hrs, a Lifetime for you. I'm so proud that you're proud and we're proud.
Just bracing myself for potentially the masterpiece of the century! Money games I II III So so keen!!
You should consider or even boost your career with a residency at the Sphere in Las Vegas. I am sure you can make proper use of the  screens, inside and out. It could even be a symbiotic project, because I believe MSG is losing money with it, beside or because having U2 opening it.
So excited for this ❤❤❤❤
35 Hours - woopwoop!!!
You can have a system of laws has long has a football field with every possible needed law in it, it will never be has complete, has making a 14 pages book on the 7 sins and the 7 virtues followed by the phrase : try and stay in virtue and don't fall to sin, if you do try and forgive yourself and move to better acts, if you fall to sin and don't do better in the future, you are a sinner. Simple has that, also validating that somes sins aren't "sinful"/"harmful" is pride in your actions validating that certain of your actions aren't sins because you are "deserving" or any other reason you might find for yourself
Cannot wait!!!!!
I'm so excited for this drop tomorrow. Dear Ren, keep inspiring and bringing light to this world. You touch the souls of everyone that takes the time to get to know you and your vision. You are painting vivid pictures of lifes ying and yang and bringing change for the better.
Man I'm buzzing for this!!!
WHAT? PART THREE? YAY
Omg I can’t wait 45 hours 😩
I’m a new fan and can not wait x
I loved the other two so much, this might be the best one yet. just live love music, the third one might be the best. over here in spanish we say: la tercera es la vencida
Two days to go, i wait and wonder why must the Earth move so slow. The wait seems endless and so soon too, I guess my brain can't cope with rational thought. Waiting
Been here since 2022 and im really psyched!
I'm really exciting about this track. 😀😀🤩 2 days is soooooooo long 😧😧😧
Been looking forward to this the last couple weeks. Can’t wait for another amazing song!!! 🎉🎉
Wow, what a strange kind of world we live in with panic and hysteria. Poor man learn the rich don't care for ya, narcissist mindset set like malaria. Sit back and watch the show, America.
I CANT WAIT, HOLY SHIT
Cant blooming wait 😊
Hey kn im so excited i actually discoverd u by my uncle through hi ren but my cousin kept pulling strings and stuff because her freinds made her think i was a bad person so that got 9 years of friendship torn also i moved to england hope u doing well man we love you
Real dick move on the three day countdown, mate.   Work: six days a week.  Three boys in club FC: six evenings a week.   One girl in club volleyball: four evenings a week.  Somehow, the wife manages to provide me with the opportunity to chop it up with one her friends' husbands twice a week.  (and she wonders why I drink... BECAUSE I JUST WANT TO SLEEP IN ON SUNDAY AND MAINTAIN A SHRED OF HOPE UNTIL JANUARY WHEN THE SEAHAWKS NARROWLY MISS THE F***ING PLAYOFFS AND CRUSH WHAT'S LEFT OF MY WITHERED SOUL!)  But it's cool. I definitely have three days of bandwidth to obsessively anticipate this release... REN.  For real, though, I'm sure you've been sweating this one. I appreciate you and your unprecedented devotion to your craft. I know you've put it all into this track and we all love you for it.
Watch the world quake, as Ren takes his stake, just the 3rd retake... of that ol' money game!
Can’t wait, I’m a new viewer I watched money game 2 first and loved it then I watched hi ren and also loved it so can’t wait for this to drop out, all love❤
Im waiting, 3 days to go😂
Bro this better be sick
So excited!!! Just can't hide it!! Losing control!! Think I like it🎉😊🎶🎻
RMS 1:29..ANYTHING TO DO WITH shawnee t. V.. The Renegade morning show.. On YouTube..?? Not study it yet but worth looking at folks.. 🤔
can anyone help with password please
What I'm most hoping for from this song is some clever reference to cheese - just to maintain the cheese ref pattern.  Expecting *grateness* either way.
I can’t believe it’s finally almost here!
I pretty much give up on new music well over 10 years ago. Then I found Ren. I think he's a genius, and i can't get enough of his different styles. He's  music is Deep and very clever. I love all the old school stuff. He's doing so well and wish him the best.
Anyone else assuming this song is going to be linked to the Mario universe due to the first video on the website after you get the first clue?
This is dropping on my birthday, perfect gift 💙
Ren, the master of 'edging' his fan base. So excited for this and for you, Ren. Your hard work, determination, and creativity are showing... and it looks SO good on you. Looking forward to seeing where all that takes you 💚
I cannot wait for your new song and I have bought 2 of your new album Ren. I really hope you smash records and touch more people's hearts and minds with your art as you have to everyone of your RENagades.
The greatest gift a person can get on their B-DAY.  Thank you REN!!!!!!!! YOU are a musical genius 🎉🎉🎉❤😊 THE TRUE G.O.A.T
I cant wait for this piece of art! i cant wait!
OH REN, REN, REN, REN A STORM IT COMES OUR WAY
Money Game part 2 is so beyond amazing. You are an important voice, and the truth is powerful. Without truth nothing would exist. Love you, brother, and anyone who reads this. ❤  The truth is, we came from one, the end is the same as the beginning, the truth will set you free, One returns to the beginning, practicing eternity. Without truth, there's nothing. ❤
The first two parts were amazing! Can't  wait for this one!
I'm so excited ❤ 🇨🇦 🍁  when @RenMakesMusic revealed his album as this gigantic work of brilliance throughout this ARG has been mind blowing 🤯 ❤ From Hi Ren to the beginning with Genesis,  the way he showcases the "monster he created" and the 7 deadly sins as in of course money game, murderer, love game part 4 lust, and who can forget the lyrics  kill kill kill kill,  absolutely HUGE project ❤❤ unreal ambition and perfectly executed!  Brilliance like never seen before! Absolutely thrilled for what Ren has accomplished ❤❤❤
Man am I excited! This one's gonna be good
Real
Is gonna be a doozie 🎸
Hey Ren.... the tears you made me cry felt like I should have cried a long time ago. I love your poetry. Your art shines an embarrassing light on my feelings. I suppose I could flee from that, but I respect it.
Ren. Your lyrics on the way you see society and world politics are truly inspirational. I have loved many musicians in my life but I can honestly say that you are the most talented and influential artist to ever walk this earth. I really appreciate you.
Woah nobody told me this was happening, can’t wait it’s gonna be great
This is going to be great!!  Really appreciate you Ren for all you do!! Notification set!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
This Premier takes me back to the hype of Micheal Jacksons Thriller Video back in the day when we all had to sit round the TV. 😂
shhhhhhh!
I wonder if luigi will be featured
I love your music, no one does it like you
Why the long wait
56 here and Amazed by his Gift …   A pleasure to watch him perform each and every time pure 🔥 and enthusiasm.  A testament to all that fight daily .   🐇🕳🖤
I missed the second I knew the first was pride so upset I couldn't get to the official website. What is that word he uses my minds blank atm
I swear if Luigi is referenced in this I'm going to destroy something
Only 7 more days! Getting excited!  I can't wait to see/hear this.  Already know its going to be great! ❤
🍿🍿🍿
Awww i cant wait. Timemachine now!
I am going to listen to this for 3 hours on repeat.
PART 3 of the money game!! I can f*ing wait! Started listening to your music with money game part2. Seen it on 9gag lol. Loved everything since, altough it wasn't necessarily my style of music. I really enjoy your busking videos with the big push too! You my man, are one of the greatest artists of the 21st century imo. No doubt about it!
555
can someone helpme
Where is the live chat arghh
Ren your a very smart man I love the way your putting this together I see your grate mind in everything you do massive fan keep it up your the greatest gift to people ❤🎉
Thanks Ren for premiering on October 12 which happens to be my wedding anniversary. Only after watching the video will I seek to enhance getting lucky that night with a dozen roses for my beautiful wife. Wish me luck!😂 🌹
The song that introduced me to Ren was hi ren, one the best songs I've listened to for a while❤❤❤
What do yall think it is imma translate it
Notifs on people!
THE SAGA
Best thing about a REN drop is the reactors reactions, the wide ranging views on what this song or that song represents....Let the Rabbit see the hole.
I am lost and i love cookies 🍪
My jaw dropped when I saw this
My birthday is on the October the 13'th. This would be the best birthday present!!! Thanks, Ren!
On tenter for your hooks, love your music when I’m cooking, looking, around for your sound, you’ve got your feet set squarely, right upon the ground, found, your rhythm, hitting me lately in my life, what happening to me, weird,it’s just as I feared,I’m spitting bars to my wife all my trouble and strife. Fuck.
Hi ren loving the competition ur running om not actively doing it as my mind does different things but have a look at the riddles must say u are not just talented as a singer but very clever just to say I appreciate u and ur music just wondering if the answer leads to purgatory lol keep it going bro will always susupport u m8 still looking to buy a sick boi jacket in 3xl m8
water welling up to eternal life...can someone do something with it?
Ren I can't put into words how thoroughly excited I am for this. Definitely the most anticipated release. Part 1 and 2 altered my brain chemistry & I think it would be safe to say that I've never come across such brilliant pieces of art again. Looking forward to another one of your beautiful and thought-provoking contributions to the betterment of the society, and of our world. Gonna stream the hell out of this, fingers crossed.
Been waiting so long since I learnt all the words to money game part 2 hope you start touring soon @RenMakesMusic me and my dad wanna see you live your music made our relationship stronger 🖤
Mad that it's dropping on my birthday. Looking forward to it. No doubt it's gonna be a blinder.
really liked the first one, two is my favourite Ren song, so exited to see the #3
Can’t wait for the last track to drop 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉💃
I CAN'T WAIT!
I am just an old woman with few ties to form a pod or hive, but I do know the first 3.  🤔🙄😉😁  1 - Pride 2 - Greed 3- Lust. ❤  see you tomorrow.
This is the first time i've ever been excited for a new song
I can't believe it is going to be a one-take and I am so excited for it.
This is too exciting, Ren! Cannot wait to see what you come with next
You've now given me a reason to continue on for another week and a half. Thank you.
I am already in the Rabbit Hole...and patiently...somewhat patiently waiting.  I am thankful for your courageous and  independent raw truths about "Good vs. Evil". We all have our own Psychological Angles and Demons to deal with...and We are neither Angel or Demon. We are just Human Beings...for me, that is enough for me. Life is complicated. However, there are times when Reason prevails. Thank  you Ren...this is one of those time when Reason kicked me in the Arse and gave me Hope.
That was a little easier than yesterday
Hell yeah Ren! Lfg!
14 minutes more....
No way!
Can somebody for the love of god explain how the moneygame riddle gahe thing works EXACTLY because i want to participate but i cant find clear directions anywhere  online. Maybe im just slow and need it really broken down in leymen terms. Ive tried to google and youtube the the rules of the fame from the very start
♤♡◇♧
Tyranny is the death of nuance, as it was always those in power that kept the tradition of tragedies alive. Paper trails hold as much weight as a bank note does when dangled off the cliff of bills. Only to watch a cheque bounce off the rock bottom of our despair. How they reserve misfortune for the desperate, spitting in our faces only to call it a water utility on the record.  Yet, I anticipate Ren setting the record straight with this number, for there is no inflation within his barmy creations. Just brilliance, honesty, and community that will set us free from the money game that those ignorant of tyrants just call Monopoly. Thank you Ren, for all that you have said and sung to inspire more than what will be and already has begun.
U remind me of young Eric Burdon from the Animals
I love you Ren 😘 I stumbled across your song years ago Jenny's tale in it's infancy, and I was immediately blown away by your style, you do have great talents and skills. So looking to see great things you create :) Much love,, Jenny❤
ren is my fav rapper he is so original and made my life 10x better i love him

REN!!! 11 DAYS IS TOO LONG. I WANT TO HEAR MARSHMALLOW PLAY. HES A GOOD BOY
I just realized that this is coming out on my Birthday on Friday October 13th hopefully I won't have bad luck this year like last time when my belt in my car shredded because I was trying to show off to the guy with me in my car lol I was going 125mph and then boom my belt shredded and I couldn't move my steering wheel at all. I almost wrecked that day on Friday October 13th 2006 I turned 19 that day lol now I think I'm going to have bad luck when my Birthday falls on a Friday the 13th 😂
WHAAAAAAAAAAT PART 3 OMG I LOVE PART 2 ASF
Here we go again boys!
I can't wait any longer 😩 😫 😭
Can’t wait for this 🖤 I don’t think I can wait 11 days 🥺
Just realized this is on my birthday. BEST BIRTHDAY GIFT EVER.
❤🎉❤🎉❤
Oooooh I am looking forward to this one!
Can not waiiitttttt for this man! Already pre ordered the album with the help of Black Pegasus!
I've never anticipated a song drop more in my life. So curious on how the one take video is shot, is Knox Hill making a cameo, or was he just behind the scenes...and of course the sick lyrics & beat. 🔥🔥🔥🖤🧡💛
❤
I CANT WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!
❤ I'm sooooooo bloody excited! I have got Nf concert in Glasgow the day before and i cant wait til its over already so its closer to money game 3 🤭❤️🤫
PART 3!?
I cannot wait to see and hear this next masterpiece of truth. You have such a massive talent and bring joy to all people who hear your music 🎶
Making  History!!!
honestly can’t wait for this!!
thank you, boi.
This will be ducking huge. I cannot even express how huge.  Money Game 2 was the one song that introduced me and a lot of people to your art. I can't wait for this to air!
I find the best way to approach these things is to have no expectations, that way it's ensured they will be surpassed. I understand the early hype is to also spread the word, as many people are not following Ren that closely. But any more and some of his fans might have a heart attack! haha.
Das haben Ratten daraus gemacht. Monogam war wohl im Ursprung eher gemeint. Ich bin Ursprung😊 Vielleicht auch ein Monogram auf einem Taschentuch oder so...
What a nice birthday present this will be looking forward to it
*OH MY, GOD!* OKAY IT'S HAPPENING!  EVERYBODY STAY CALM!   Who are kidding. BOOHST THIS SHIT TO THE HIGH HEAVENS! HUMANITY NEEDS TO HEAR IT FOR HUMILITY TO TAKE PRIORITY!!!   Ren, as always brutha; LOVE YA, YA MAD C*NT! 💛💛💛💛💃  💰🤡DO YA WANNA PLAYYY A GAME?!¿¡¿¡¿¡¿¡ 🤡💰
We are ready! These are my favourites , full of truth. You're about to enlighten the masses. 👏🏼
OMG I can't wait!!!
Let’s gooooooo
She sells seashells on the seashore, but the value of these shells will fall, do to law of supply and demand, no one wants to buy shells, causd theres loads on the sand!
So excited for this one!
Yesssss!!!! October will be a lovely month indeed.
Youtube, you ready with the password? I dunno who's commanding the youtube renegades. But spread around for anyone who doesn't know: password is TMG{In_pL41N_S1GHT} (pay attention to uppercase/lowercase, that's the format of all our passwords according to Jen 😂)
Hibernation, activate!
Can’t wait to see what you, Sam and the team have come up with!   The last juicy morsel until your album is birthed 💜🔥
What I DON'T know: How Ren could possibly improve _Money Game_ ... What I DO know: Yes.
I’m so fkn excited
Ren...what a masterpiece we only have a spark of so far. I think I am on the right track. This is an anomaly that I've never thought anyone was capable of. Bright Blessing )O(
When u think life couldn't be better
Pure hype 😂
In my time one had to wait outside in the rain or in the cold. To watch a great movie. I can wait.
Ren - I will be buying the vinyl !! - thank you for that.  I asked for it - you responded - now I need to preorder the vinyl.  54 years old and loving RenMusic.   Money Game is an artistic through line for you I believe.  Not gonna play play the money game hunt - just not that connected online. Your music is inspiring and the BEST i have heard in decades.
I am so impatient for the release
Can’t wait!! x.
I cannot tell you how hyped I am for this !!!
WHOO!
I picked up on so many clues, I'm confused more now than when I started! My brain hurts.  Can't wait for 10/12!
#like 0:00
Hello everyone
I smell a revolution...
So hyped for this. Cannot wait 😆😆😆
Still haven’t heard a ren song I don’t like don’t expect it to change anytime soon!
A long time to wait! 🙈 I am looking forward to it! ♥️🎶
The value of these shells will fall my friends...
Yoooooooo 🤘🤑🤘
The values of these shells will fall my friends...
Money Game pts. 1&2 are some of my favorite tracks out of your library. Your flex tracks are great too but these tracks are so reflective of this era in history. I'd suggest everyone who has been treading water these last 2 decades to watch CoinBureau's "The Financial System is Rigged!" for an expansion on what Ren touches upon in these tracks. CoinBureau is obviously pro Bitcoin but to their credit they never mention crypto once in this video. It is purely about how the system forces those at the bottom to rely on currency while those at the top rake in the money. FYI, those are two very different things. I would love for Ren to explore the dichotomy of the rich and poor, currency and money, and how that seperates the financially free from the financially enslaved.
Yo this premieres on my Birthday!!!!!! BEST PRESENT EVER!😂
Haven’t been this excited since Pink Floyd released Animals!
I found you when you released money game 2, and I love that song. So hyped for this one!
I'm so fucking excited for this. 😁
Noice💙
Can’t wait! 😬🤘🏻🤘🏻👍🏻👍🏻
The best Birthday Gift 🎉 🎈 🎈🎈🎉 Thank you, Ren!! I will be there!
Man I'm so excited for this song. MG2 is one of my all time favorites from any artist. It's crazy that I only found Ren a few months ago and he has already put out some of my all time favorite tracks. Sick Boialbum is going to stay in repeat
It's my bd that day and I will be in Lanzarote but I will absolutely be on here for this ❤
Nah nah nah nahnah...I'm loving it!! Lol
Could it be real? Could it be Ren? Could it be hyped again and again. Something to steal? Something to lend? Oh, I'm so psyched I can not pretend.
OMG I feel like every single hair I have is up awaiting along with everyone else! The best part of waiting is knowing how good it will be and still not knowing wtf Ren master mind will blow us over with! 🎉ahhhh ❤
GG !
This is sooooo exciting  !!!! 💰 $$💰
Can’t wait.

Can't wait for everyone to see this labour of love. Never been so excited to share something with the world and nervous at the same time!
We're ALL part of it. Let's go, Ren.🤟🏻🔥🎶
Can't wait
My man.   You can't start the countdown this far out.   I'm not gonna be able to handle the wait.
Looking forward to this more than certain family members' birthdays!
I discovered you many years ago through Money Game part 2. 💰 It has been an amazing experience watching you turn your suffering into art that inspres myself & many others. I know that Money Game Part 3 will be yet another major success & I'm here cheering for you all the way brother. 👏   I love you & may god continue to bless you & your creative spirit 💰 🎮
1 and 2 are some of my favourite songs, this ought to be great.

Ren has the innate ability to slow time by posting a premier...jeez going to be a long couple of weeks😂
Can this song/video live up to the hype?   I, for one wouldn't bet against Ren. This is gonna be next level, prepare yourself to be blown away!
You have my attention!

13 days!  I might pass on of old age by then. Lol (I will be 71 tomorrow, last day of September.  Yes, one doesn’t have to be under 30 to enjoy your music.😊 And no worries, I’m in good health, so I am not planning on leaving this lifetime soon!  Too much to learn and enjoy yet!)
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hope you’re well mate The anticipation is crazy ☮️
I can hardly wait 🎉
I can't wait for this to drop.  Wish I had the money for Sick boy, but I can just play it on repeat on youtube!
I'm so glade I stumbled across ren I his music has and is helping me ❤❤
Im making things up as go along and finding clues all around which probably mean nothing at all. But its all good fun . You are brilliant but evil 😂
I haven't been this excited for a song or artist in my entire life.
Looking forward to it Ren, but a bit disappointing that you are launching it at 3.00 a.m. UK time
Money Game Part 3? hell yea
Was so hoping for a sneaky peaky.. til then ill be on the sidelines with my riddle answers and will reward myself with the Sick Boi vinyl win or lose I WIN! 😂
First my birthday, now this fun stuff!!! I’m having a great time! Thanks, man!🎉
