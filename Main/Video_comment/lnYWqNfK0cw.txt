❤🌍🕊 I am a person who stands with the humanity. My heart goes to those people who are suffering in Palestine and Israel. We can't blame one party for a war.   Why I say this?  I live in a country called Sri Lanka. We have people with different beliefs live here namely, Buddhists, Catholics, Muslims and Hindus.   But what Islamic mosques do? It is a widely known fact that the Islamic preachers do teach the younger generation of Muslims only about the importance in prioritizing the people with their similar beliefs. According to them, a person with a different belief is not worth prioritizing. It is a brainwashing method for someone’s advantage maybe, but I don’t know who. I believe that teaching leads to ultimate separation and possible future wars. The younger generation of Muslims have become very serious about that and they have no idea about respecting other religions. They are extremely brain-washed I see. Sadly, the majority of the people around the world identify the muslims as violence. If they don't work to clear that from then, who will do that for them?   This fear of future threats caused by the teachings of Islamic mosques are driving other nationalities to declare wars against them. We have witnessed many wars like that against Muslims. That is why I said, WE CANNOT BLAME ONE PARTY on war situations.  I have a suggestion; the whole world should step forward and implement a monitoring method for all the religious centers (despite of the belief) around the world to monitor what they teach the followers. Via that, the world will identify who's spreading the racism.  If you have a better suggestion than this, please bring it out. This is the high time to do that.   I NEED A PEACEFUL WORLD and I STAND FOR IT. ❤🌍🕊
You people r living free in MY country, Free to protest, but i draw the line at hate speech. if  you hate America an American's #GoHome you r free to leave anytime..its time this country starts to deport any and all people back to there own country...#AmericaLoveitorLeaveit  iif you hate me an my country go home

America has become LAWLESS in supporting the hate of Russians, Chinese,  and Palistinians!
I am so tired of feeling like I am the only one demanding morality from my government!
Thank You so much! I am not the only voice anymore!
Dont care IDF love
Great over half of million
On 29 November 1947 the UN General Assembly voted on the partition plan, adopted by 33 votes to 13 with 10 abstentions. The Jewish side accepted the UN plan for the establishment of two states. The Arabs rejected it and launched a war of annihilation against the Jewish state. And Balestinians keep refusing 2 states solution for 75 years now.
The neighboring Arab countries attacked Israel in 1948. Among these were Egypt, Syria, Iraq, and Transjordan. Egypt would occupy the Gaza Strip and Transjordan annexed the West Bank.
Hey Joe...there's someone at the door
Google dis not want me to see this .. hard to find this video.
Palestine will be free
I couldn’t attend but have whole hearted support for this rally and would like to thank all those who have stood for humanity and against the genocide.✌️
Vote out Biden
This is what happens when people overstay their visa and you don’t enforce the law
Their domestic terrorist that should’ve never took place, and they shouldn’t have been allowed to fly in the capital
Blame Hamas for the deaths of children,  war continues because they refuse to release hostages and yet Israel is blamed.  This does not make sense to me.
Demanding for ceasefire but why are you not demanding for the release of hostages.
I had planned to likely vote for someone besides Trump, but this march has changed my mind.  This march is as much about Muslim desires to destroy Israel and historic America as anything.  Asking that America stop funding Israel, talking Arabic, shouting for Palestine all including Iran's like desires to destroy Israel and America; and that is true even though they live and benefit being in America.  They are here because of too much extremist liberalism.  I'm liberal, but just not extremist liberal over immigration, especially a flood and invasion of immigration with no chance for assimilation.  For one, Muslims coming to America with their women covered from head to toe is in the face of women's rights fought for decades if not
Thousands really you say thousands shame on you it's almost a million people in there
Burnol moment for Sanathani indians
Stop genocides war crimes freedom for Palestine 🇵🇸
President Erdoğan's reaction in Gaza to the UN: A just world is possible, but not with the United States.  رد فعل الرئيس إردو إركان في غزة على الأمم المتحدة: عالم عادل ممكن ، لكن ليس مع الولايات المتحدة.  Reacción del presidente Erdoğan en Gaza ante la ONU: Un mundo justo es posible, pero no con Estados Unidos.
.....International financial boycotts were the primary factors in the collapse of apartheid in South Africa. The only way to end apartheid in Israel is to boycott them.   And a one state solution is the answer........
Free Palestine 🇯🇴🙏
Mardi Gras! Cool men in dresses and hairy women!
Islamic taqqya worked ... lets keep strong against islamists ... their philosophy is of hate
No matter what religion you are from, I am grateful to you, beautiful people, for giving your time to such a meaningful protest and showing that you are with the Palestinian people. May God grant you the true religion, Islam, according to your beautiful hearts.
Hamas is not a nationalist group, it wants an Islamic state across what is Palestine and Israel. Hamas has committed a massacre of civilians and did rape and murder. They launched rockets at civilian targets, use the Palestinians as human shields, and Israel is the bad guy for defending themselves and routing out an Islamist group. In any military activity no matter how hard they try (the IDF do try) you can't avoid civilian deaths especially when Hamas wants civilian deaths and deliberately puts people in harm's way. There were people who were murdered for leaving their homes and trying to turn South. When you march in favour of Palestine, demanding ceasefires you are supporting this group whether you like it or not. You should be asking your preachers why I should support one group of people just because they share the same religion as me?
Where were all the protests when Assad was bombing the hell out of the muslims in Syria ?? The above is all about hating on the jews , not concern for their fellow muslims
No one wants anyone to be killed except Hamas who celebrates killing innocent civilians. You protest while Hamas has innocent hostages- even children! Why don't you protest for release of all the hostages and then for peace. Hamas has said that Israel "doesn't have a right to exist."  So when you protest are you protesting for the destruction of all Israelis?
Free free palistain.
Thanks God😭🇵🇸🙏
Apparently not realizing how destructive these peace-loving demonstrators are to themselves and their free way of life... they do not even... bother to think for a minute what life would actually be like for them if they lived in Gaza, Beirut, Damascus or Tehran. It is easy to be a demonstrator in London, Washington DC or New York.
how can the left , who are against racism , support this? The hypocrisy and double standards of the left are astounding!
Close the damn borders!
Quit misrepresenting the peaceful pro Israel protest for the pro Hammas protest crowd.😲
Why don't black people protest like this when our people rights are violated and why don't others stand up for us but black people stand with everyone else 🤔 I don't get that part 😮
Say you have some guy goes out gets drunk and sucker punches the biggest guy in the bar and breaks his nose. The big guy gets up and knocks the crap out of the guy.  Afterward they drunk cries foul because the guy is so much bigger and can hit harder. Then goes on the internet and starts a "go fund" to get money to pay for his injuries. Only he has done this repeatedly- should he receive any donations? Isn't this EXACTLY what The Hamas leadership has been doing and getting rich!
Why isn’t this entitled “Pro Hamas crowd”?
Pro-Terrorist Rally. Call it was it really is.
From the river to the sea, free Palestine 🇵🇸
Hamas troops need to stop hiding around its citizens so they won't be attacked but nobody wanna talk about that store due to fear like what we see now. What about Israel children, they got attacked for no reason oh because America released him due to a trade smh and we need a at your own risk when traveling to other countries 🤷🏽 we're tired of saving idiots that don't want to leave, but cry home when they butts get captured smh if im in another country and my country causing kaios, that's my signal to get   out that spot before im captured no tell will i live
We need to protest like this from being treated poorly while these immigrants coming over here getting tooken good care of smh we need to protest their butts back home, if they can't do this in their country don't come to ours and cause hell
But when American did this..
And how many Muslims have killed other Muslims in Syria alone? Apparently over 300,000 in the last few years not to mention all the other hate between Shia and Sunni nations. Where is the reporting on that?
No matter  how many protest you Muslim have around the world, isarel is a land people  that god ✝️ chose .Isarel a land where jews live surrounded by a Muslim country ,And you  Muslim a try to destroy jews but the God of isarel ✝️ will protect 🇮🇱
Not one American flag. Unlike the March for Israel today, which is full of them.  I'm sick of this foreign nationalist invasion.
Never seen so much crowd supports abductors
Billions across da globe rally support for Palestine
I love how xTHEYx beg! Keep BEGGING! THERE WILL BE NO CEASEFIRE, PERIOD 🇺🇸⚡️💪
That’s is not thousands that’s half a million people
Its funny...none of these people were protesting while hamas was offing Israeli civilians.
They are human ❤❤❤❤
Help gaza
I am surprised how the Zionists were able to rule America. Even the free Americans themselves have no place or authority in their country.
Free palastine from zionist
There's no such thing as Palestine.
make sure you fly your rainbow flag to,your standing with them
Good Biden feels like this won't cost him his presidency but he's wrong AF for every Palestinian child killed he loose a vote. This is only going to make ppl turn on Israel even more
This is the on going pathetic demise of our country by the evil democrats party. They are out to destroy this country and the clueless sheep have fallen for it hook line and sinker. Can’t believe how many stupid people roam the streets of America
Also who burned babies in ovens and militated and raped and killed whole families? Hamas did. Who does HAMAS represent? The people in Gaza. They elected them.  There was a cease fire on October 6th. Maybe, just maybe they should not have raped, killed, mutilated, kidnapped and murdered innocent peace loving civilians. Maybe they wouldn’t be getting what they deserve. FACT: Hamas uses THEIR CHILDREN to dig tunnels and as HUMAN SHIELDS!!!They hate Israel more then they love their OWN People. WAKE UP AND SEE THE TRUTH!!!!!!!!!!!! Stop supporting terrorism you idiots!
Yup, the once great Britain has become a terrorist state.
Why is no body asking Palestinians(Hamas) to return 238 hostages?
It's Heartbreaking, Great job guys 👍 ❤
Stop killing and do what God says! Love your brother as God loves you!
Impeach and Geneva Convention for Biden, Blinken, and Netanyahu for the continued war crimes and genocide on the Palestinian people!!!
Palestine started the war with Israil killing 1500 civilians. I don't belive to any palestinian. They all are liers.
If Israel granted a cease fire right now dose anyone really think that Hamas would give up their pledge of genocide against the Jews?
How many children do you suppose would die if we let Hamas continue their extermination of all Jews as they have pledged to do? What else do you think "From the river to the sea" means? It is a call for genocide against all Jews living in Israel.  There are well over 2 million children in Israel.... Are you advocating for their genocide?   How many times must this be pointed out... Israel is not attempting genocide against the palestinian people they are attempting to stop Hamas from committing genocide against the people of Israel... If Hamas would not place their military assets next to civilian structures as human shields and moved their people to safty none of their children would be dying...uf ch
NO one in this demonstration talks about the massacre of the population of Israel on October 7 by the PSLESTINIANS OF HAMAS. They do not talk about the release of the kidnapped people from different nations by the HAMAS TERROSISTS. No one talks about the terrible videos of the murders filmed by the same HAMAS TERRORISTS in the Jewish communities
PLO flags. They are regurgitating the old Soviet/new russian state propaganda.
Free free Palestine 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
We need a Donald trump. Please Donald apply for citizen  ship we will vote u in. From the UK.  Great Britain don't make me fuckin laugh 😂
Free Brian.  Blessed are the cheese makers.  Thank you peaceful sky-daddy religions. "Religion poisons everything."--Christopher Hitchens If prayers were answered, we'd be basking in perpetual peace and tranquility.
Title should read, "Americans protest the Palestinian genocide being funded with their tax dollars they don't approve" as what they are saying themselves in their own words
SHAME SHAME
BIDENS ASHAMED THSTD WHY WE DONT SEE THIS
Biden adhamed   you fool
mainstream ????
dc looks likr this now?
this is one of the largest therapy sessions ive ever seen.
Palestina libre ya fuera el sionismo masón satánico
Why are we not deporting these people.   Law states that if they support a terrorist group we can void their greencard and citizenship.   Hamas is a terrorist group.   Why are e not deporting hese people?!   Deport them NOw!!!!!!
Free Palestine 🇵🇸✌️
Americans Attention Kindly Attention..US With Israel Directly Involve Genocide of Palentine People Including Innocent Children.And Also Fox Sky ABC News Channels Are Pro-Israeli Hiding Facts News From You Americans.
Holzscheit aus Sodom und Gomorra und ihre Nachbarn Städten am gerichtstag der Offenbarung Jesus Christus Sohn Gottes des Gottes Israels unseres retter im Namen Jesu Christi. In euer Heimatland Unkraut 👹👺👹👺👹
Why does Palestine not show the whole world on its long way to seek peace that it is realy interested in it by taking out the passages from their constitution to wipe out Israel (their neighbors) and the jews...  Why does Egypt not accept their brothers and sisters (their neighbors) who seek refuge from palestine?   Why does Saudi Arabia do not allow to set up the Caliphate in Mekka or Medina?  Why are extreme muslims wish and seek to set up the caliphate anywere in western countries to bring peace to the world?  Lots of questions...seeking for answers
AND YOU DONT THINK THERE ARE ANY TERROR CELLS IN AMERICA. OUR GOVERMENT BETTER THINK TWICE ABOUT THAT AND THIS IS JUST IN WASHINGTON.
EEUU ya quedó descubierto como el más sanguinario y psicopata gobierno que tiene al mundo secuestrado y no les importa ocultarlo     Viva Medio Oriente libre de esas bestias
https://youtube.com/shorts/xy6Esi25F1o?si=fnY6LkrrSwTytHqt.....Pro Israel protestor chased away from Palestinian protest
Why so many inναders αrε in other country??😮
Right now the only thing holding USA together is its wealth.Not its constitution or identity.
Looks like george soros funded the 2 groups doing this with millions. Google it.  Is he building an army against the united states.
George soros dumped millions into the 2 groups funding this.  Looks like george soros is building an army.  These protestors cry about dead palestian childen, but support democrats and joe biden who kill milllions of aborted american children every year.  Hypocrites all of them.
Lol they start a war with a country and didnt think there would be consequences.
American politics needs to change to a new party, because the both parties are in control by the coperation, especially the military industrial complex, Our world 🌍 need peace 🕊️ cooperation and prosperity.... Ceasefire now & free Palestine.
¡ THIS PEOPLE ARE NOT AMERICANS ! This is more dissgusting that the Sodomite pride , Muslims belong to the ARABIA DESERT not to Israel the land of God.
Open your eyes world israhell ingin mengambil tanah kalian!!
Biden OBAMA is laughing at the crowds
I don’t understand what the issue is, let Hamas give back the hostages, and there will be an immediate cease-fire
You ever seen Hunger Games? The part where they go back to Distric 12 after it was fire bombed. You think they won't do that here?
Is this the US? unbelievable, muslims fooled you too? I thought only Europe was lost, sad for you all :(
Let’s rally for free healthcare next. If we have billions for war and overseas aid. We should have billions set aside for healthcare that includes every single American citizen.
I don't know how your logic works, everything that happens in Gaza is a response to the crimes committed by Hamas on October 7th.  I see a huge difference between someone who kills innocents with his own hands with a knife and a gun and there is even a video I saw where you can clearly see that Hamas cuts off the head of an innocent Thai man, a man of the agricultural land and nothing more, and everything is done in the name of extreme Islam, so there is a difference between a deliberate inhumane attack and the murder of innocents  a crime, and a response that I think is too subtle from the other side, because Hamas also knows the price in advance, if you really feel sorry for the Palestinian people, free them first from Hamas and from terrorism,
Why Muslims are silent when China or Myanmar oppressing Muslims? This is just for their deep hatred against Israel and not because of religion
Hunter Biden can help
You forgot about Ukraine ha ha 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😅🤣😅
The comments of  Muslims in the West on Youtube are plain funny to me. These guys obviously have a soft heart and unadulterated love for their neighbors, so they are somehow touched by all the human suffering in Gaza. Not because it is about Palestinians and Muslims (no, no no no, God forbid), but because they sympathize with every form of human suffering and suffering, regardless of religion and nation. What surprises me is the fact that these humanists only let their voices be heard when it comes to Muslims. Somehow they don't really come forward when others are suffering, often at the hands of those same concrete-brained Muslims. I don't know the reason for this, but I assume that they don't have time because when others are suffering they are either sitting in a coffee shop drinking coffee/coke, following sports results in a betting shop, or masturbating with material produced in the West, which they consume on devices created in the West, through technology created in the West.
Most of these stupid people were protesting for lgbtquelmnop rights just last month. Lol now they are supporting gaza where being gay is a death sentence with no trial. US protesters are stupid people.
Has anybody told the protesters that we aren't firing the missiles, Israel is lol. If Palestine didn't want to get smashed they shouldn't have started it. Kinda like a bully that picks on people then says uncle while hes getting his ass kicked. Like Rick Maranis said in spaceballs, "KEEP FIRING ASSHOLES!!!
Dios siempre pelea por Israel 🇮🇱 anos y siglos dios bendiga Israel siempre amén y van aver como dios de Israel destruye a su enemigo porque dios pelea por Israel 🇮🇱 anos y siglos dios bendiga Israel siempre amén
Was there mention of their threats of gee hawd in America???
😅😂🤭 Zionist Israel and its allies will spread lies, slander, and they are a group of hypocrites. Before executing their politicians, this group of cursed people carried out slander, baseless accusations, the game was always the same, such as World War 1-2, chaos in Southeast Asia, and other parts of the world. They will do cause and effect politics, and the like. Whether or not there is a tunnel that passes through the Indonesian Hospital is not Indonesia's business. Here, Indonesia always stands on a sense of humanity. That is the goal and benefit of a hospital in the true sense. The Palestinian plains were the blueprint they themselves knew. The tunnel could be anywhere. This does not mean that Israel's statement with all its political attributes can justify efforts to destroy the hospital. What kind of people are they, they have no dignity and no sense of humanity. Why is it that every time the capitalist system is about to collapse, they create war on this earth? In fact, they are terrorists, you barbarians. They will never realize that the dollar currency and the capitalist system will eventually eat away at their economy. The dollar has fallen far short of its true value. They will even sacrifice their own people, by accelerating AI and robots, as an effort if the war is not won. The Israeli political elite and its allies are a bunch of greedy and corrupt people. Down because of his own actions.
Half the people out there are just there to be a part of something, since they have no identity.
Man it’s a tough world to live in right now for a Jewish person . It must feel like the 40s all over again. 😢 nazi today are the ones that favor Hamas and the Iranians. Who would think that this would happen today. The world really is preparing for A WW3. Next step is a draft, when that happens it’s proof of the end.
Ceasefire now ! The whole world is watching. Palestinians should be free!
WAKE UP AMERICA!!  Sad to see a multitude supporting a terrorist group!! A group that not only hates and wants to eliminate the Jewish people, but has ALSO threatened to destroy the USA 🇺🇸.    **Seems like some US citizens forgot our 9/11 and how it change our lives.**  Israel does not belong to Palestine. This land was promised to Abraham through his wife not his slave. “The Lord made a covenant with Abraham to give the land to him and his descendants as an inheritance (Gen. 15:7, 18–19).”  That’s the HISTORY of Israel whether people like it or not.  Palestines wants something that does not BELONG to them. Proclaiming something that is not yours, does not make it yours. Ignorant people in America are cheering up to their own opressor.
These people are evil don’t they realize what will happen if they have a cease fire
why no one comments on hamas. why they killed  innocent  Jewish people including kids? why no arab countries take these people as refuges and help palastine .There plan is to spread teh religion in western countries .See france sweden  soon canada join in the list

I love it! A living proof how racist and antisemitic democrats are...
Usa is scary country, too many pro hamas , scary thing
The world knows full well that you cannot believe anything said by the USA. Secretly they collide on everything the Zionist regime does, eradicating the Palestinians from their land and home is directly from the USA playbook of forcing the Native Americans onto reservations. We’re not all idiots.
"You will surely find the most intense of the people in animosity toward the believers [to be] the Jews and those who associate others with Allāh; and you will find the nearest of them in affection to the believers those who say, "We are Christians." That is because among them are priests and monks and because they are not arrogant."{Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:82}
We Jews in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem support the establishment of the Palestinian state, we do not support the mass murder in Gaza by Bibi and Gvir,. NOT IN OUR NAME...PLEASEE.....HELP GAZA...HELP PALESTINE...!!!PLEASEEE...
There are that many Palestinians in the USA!?
This was not possible in the old days
Free Palestine ❤❤
Calling on true British to protect the cenotaph on the 11th November.
They bring chais everywhere they go
Yea man all of them tax money funding the war
did you mean hundreds of thousands ? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
They want peace.
Thank God, recent events have revealed to us the truth about the Human Rights Commission, the Security Council, and the United Nations. Glory to humanity, peoples without discrimination
You might want to try hundreds of thousands of people.   It's about 2 to 3 hundred thousand people there.
Pro-Palestinians/Hamas(terrorism) are very professional organize. They are not college students. They have a lot of money to rent buses, food, hotels etc…. American woke up!!! Don’t be fooled!!!!!
They voted for Biden. What do you expect
PIGFEST.
It is great to see all these people who love justice and freedom, May Allah bless them❤
The face of evil is right in front of you
How dare they sorry ass pieces of s*** protests in America where America gave them freedom
You ambushed Israel in Gaza now you lost you want cease fire? And some of us support them?
Shame on you ! https://www.youtube.com/shorts/vzqatMgq2BI
ProHamas lol
Living Scripture...be ready for the Rapture. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🇺🇸
The media is silencing the people of the untied states.
Playing right into the hands of Hamas and Hezbollah. Hamas deprives Palestines of foreign aid, water and fuel. They keep most of it for themselves. They abuse their own people. Arab countries don't let Palestinians to their country so they can die in Gaza. Wake up, you fools!
Viva Palestina libre. No más genocidio.
All Muslims WanT to die for Islam as martyrs, so why are these Muslims protesting?  Why are these Muslims depriving their brethren in Gaza from their opportunities to go straight to Allah’s heaven because they might die as martyrs for Islam in Gaza. And, as martyrs for Islam, they receive as a reward going straight to heaven instead of going straight to hell to be tortured and punished by Allah in hell.  Martyrs get to skip being tortured indefinitely by Allah in hell for their sins until Allah is satisfied with the pain, agony, tortures, and punishment that Allah has inflicted on Muslims.  It is only the martyrs for Islam that get to skip this processing and get to go straight to Allah’s heaven.  Martyrdom is a golden ticket straight to Allah’s heaven. How cruel are Muslims to deprive their brethren in Gaza opportunities for them to possibly die as martyrs for Islam. Israelis and the USA are actually merciful as well as literally respecting and honoring Islam greater than these protesting Muslims.  These protesting Muslims greatly dishonor their God, Allah. Sad.
Look at all the terrorists in our country.. Unbelievable.
The Fourth Reich is alive and well in America
The entire world is to blame for this deeply saddening calamity. The entire world should protect both Israel & Palestinians; Ukrainians & Russians; and every other nation--small or great. The entire humanity should form one military alliance for our human family regardless of race or religion.
Unbelievable. Hamas murders thousands of Israelis, IDF does their best to limit civilian casualties in a response to these attacks on their very existence, yet thousands, maybe millions, of people want them to do even less... to literally do NOTHING about it. Just take it Israel.
Nazi much?
Bro this like hellmageddon I'm sorry but seriously wtf? I'm tryna watch my language sry
Free Palestine from what? Hamas or Israel? I don’t see anyone holding a sign “free is of Hamas”… odd
Insurrection
We can’t do enough. Our rallies and protests don’t do anything. These people in power need to step up. We are literally powerless
The attack on 10/7 was done during an ongoing ceasefire.
Why just say thousands when it was estimated over 300,000? Sounds like you’re trying to minimize this impact?
We always stand with Palestine
MOre people than JAN 6th!   Americans are more concerned about PAlestine than THEIR WON FAMILES AND CHILDREN!??
In support of “cease fire”.
People should protest the totalitarian governments
That's a lot of democrats supporting terrorist...no wonder the US is falling apart.
I wish I could have been there.  The slaughter needs to stop.
Have you forgot your history or 6 million Jews were killed murdered by people who think like you go to hell
Zionist media network will not show this
What if Ukraine start bombing Russia and during the process there are casualties? How would world react to it? These rally’s are fully funded and shame to see these rallies are becoming more prominent recently and funding organizations are supporting groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.
Mashallah, I was there but I didn't know it was that big! Alhamdulilah I am glad I was a part of this.❤
And what would happen if Isreal ceasefires?
Democrats have always been antisemitic.   They are showing their despicable nature.
UNBELIVEABLE!!! Morons will protest something that's happing by murders in another country, but no protest in their own country when criminals steal the election....if Trump was in there would be NOTHING to protest. Absolute moron's!
✌️🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
I was for Biden but after this massacre. I think DT is the right guy.
All this people are the ones that don’t work Biden regime is paying all this people not to work that’s why we’re in this situation bidenomics
🇵🇸❤️🙏🏻
I find it interesting that all the intense protests across the world against Israel which has been happening for just 1 month or so, BUT, where were/are all these protesters for Ukraine???  Russia has killed so many more civilians in the almost 2 years of their attack on Ukraine, and Ukraine did NOT shoot missiles or rockets to incite any war with Russia....is that not a crime against humanity???  Where is the condemnation against Russia?   I do think that Russia has incited the worldwide condemnation of Israel to take away from what they are doing in Ukraine.
Poor babies that were murdered by hamas in Israel were just forgotten????? How?
Useful dummies. They would be attacked by the people they are supporting
I will never forget how on 9/11 people were jumping out of a burning twin towers windows and how News Yorkers were  running down the street  away from  the Twin Towers as those 2 buildings started to collapse. and all the dust.... I wonder how families of 9/11 victims are feeling now when they see hundreds of thousands of people dressed like jihad terrorists marching down the streets in the USA with Jihad flags, When people dressed like terrorists who killed their families on 9/11 are allowed to march like Nazis in  every major city in America
Peaceful people with good hearts do not support Gaza's Hamas terrorists who do not allow 74% of Gaza women the right to vote. People with good hearts do not support Hamas' homophobia. Hamas, the ruling party of Gaza criminalizes homosexuality.
Some of the Trump rallies were bigger than this rally.
I heard these words from someone saying, "Where were you when ISIS was launched in the name of Islam and beheaded tens of thousands of Arabs in Libya, Syria and Iraq? Why didn't you take it to the streets and raise their flags and condemn a terror and call for a cease fire?Where were you when Arabs and terrorist killed thousands of Arabs in Syria and Libya? why didn't you take it to the streets then and raise Syrian and Libyian flags and condemn the terror and call for a cease fire? Where were you in the last decade when Saudi Arabia backed by other Arab countries killed and starved out more than 400,000 Yemanis. When millions of Arabs are slaughtered by other Arabs you say absolutely nothing, But when 7,000 Arabs are killed by Jews defending their right to exist, you revolt and get angry you raise the flag you condemn the terror and you call for a cease fire."
Thats larger than the insurrection.
Rachel Corrie an American was murdered by IDF, If they treat Americans like that what do you think they are doing to entire family's
idk why they are protesting the prime minister from israel said it wont be a cease fire people just dont get what they want from protesting dont work sad to say only time change come is when people war then who ever wins get what they want taliban had to fight for wat they believe urkiane fighting russia to remain urkiane russia  fighting to liberate urkiane protesting wont change nothing i watched a video when a senator said if people want change and want the truth from the government  maybe if they rise up and demand the truth they will get it coming from the horses mouth
What's the counterargument to the people saying that a ceasefire would result in Hamas getting more opportunities to do terror attacks on innocent civilians? I hope that the people saying this are wrong
🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸💪💪💪
Thousands that are miss guided or worshipping the devil.  Only the God of Israel is the true God and the Jews Are his children.   Nobody including  all the country’s that neighbor them which are Muslims want the Palestinians . You might want to think about that.  There own kind don’t want them.   🤔
These are the cowards that had to of voted for Biden. People have forgotten about September 11th.
The economy of Gaza City was dependent on small industries and agriculture. After years of decline, economic growth in Gaza is now on the rise, boosted by foreign aid. According to the International Monetary Fund, the economy grew 20 percent in 2011, and the per capita gross domestic product increased by 19 percent.   Free palestine? They were free before Hamas captured foreigners and Israelis. Check why their "brothers" didn't accept  them as refugees before this latest killing of their hostages. Who accepted them? Not UK? Not US? Now who is going on making a fuss in that country they take refuge in. Gaza city is more developed than Sarawak, Malaysia. Guess who contributed? If Israel is still killing even when Hamas is critical. That will be a term called using Excessive force. That's also how many law enforcers got fired, injured or killed . Hope to see what will Wakanda do. Let them go and recuperate or hope they will turn over a new leaf. again
I hear, “Free Free Palestine!” Yet, ThaT is exactly what Israel is doing.  They are fighting terrorists and freeing them from Hamas.
😂😂Losers😂😂
Ha, ordinary Americans, really think you have the control?  From Vietnam war to BLM, to Gaza today, you can protect as much as you want, it just won't change a thing.
I love this. The Democrats and these pro terrorist worshipers continue to show how out of touch they are with average Americans. It also will help to get the Republican and conservative vote out in 2024.
Thank you, DC 🇺🇸 ❤
1000s of  communist Americans and foreigners   ! This  country needs to deport all foreigners  now !
F Palestine.
lots of names gonna be going on the FBIs watch list that much i know...israel isnt going anywhere and they will be successful.
This is the kind of America I love except its leaders, more like tyrants. Lol
Israel must buy out the Palestinians. Will probably cost them trillions, but then Israel would have a land title free and clear of any encumbrances. No country wants to take in a poor Palestinian, but a rich Palestinian?...🤔
Here we can see how many morons have US. A lot.
I love seeing this. The white supremacist are freaking out.
Islam is the original oppression against christians according to Surah 9:29
It’s mind boggling how many people complaining about media coverage, suggesting they support Israel. They must be smoking crack for we all know MM is in bed with Palestinians. Are these people living in another world? 😂
WHO paid to have all those HAMAS supporters bused FROM the border ???
Overhead shots of the ANTI Abortion march years ago
Free free Palestine
Why are populate muslim inside ur country? ,
Well we all know where trump stands on this ...Israel israel Israel....2 edged sword people bidens too gutless ...and trump simply don't give a rats razoo...we are heading into Kaos...Isreal accounts for 37% of the world's richest people go figure why these spineless politicians and religious leaders back Israel...elite grifting as usual and they don't care if children die either ..shameless
change the title to HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS 😊
And for every person there -- there are probably 100 people in the silent majority who recognize that a ceasefire only benefits Hamas.
The terrorists and these terrorists supporters always seem to want a cease-fire when they are losing.
Funny how us here in the states don’t care because it’s football season baby !
Maybe now we will now stand up united for ourselves in our own country as free sovereign beings should do, before it's too late!
That more den the Jews could ever get hahaha 😂
the human world against Zionism
I think this whole whole situation is ridiculous. So, I've been doing some research into the history of this debacle and, as horrifying and revolting as the situation is, it's difficult for me to have sympathy for either side.  Here's what's going on from my perspective:  There's a big playground with two groups of bullies, the Jews and the Arabs.  And, although it's densely populated,from what I understand, there is enough land and resources for everyone to live there comfortably. However, Jews:  This is MY land. Arabs: No, this is MY land. Jews: Well, I have an invisible, magic man in the sky who says it belongs to me. Arabs: Well, I have an invisible, magic man in the sky who says it belongs to ME. Jews; Well, my  invisible, magic man in the sky says I can kill you. Arabs:  Well, my  invisible, magic man in the sky says I can kill you, too.  My mom and I had a rather gruesome pastime in Palm Springs as a kid (which I find abhorrent today):  We'd take a large glass bowl and fill it with desert dirt.  Then, we'd collect some black ants from the desert, and put them in the bowl with some sugar bread and water.  After a few days, they'd made it their home.  Then, we'd collect some red ants, and put them in the bowl with the black, and watch them fight each other to the death.  There was plenty of dirt, plenty of food, plenty of water, plenty of room. But they're insects and don't know any better.  How are the Jews and Arabs any different?   Émile Zola — 'Civilization will not attain to its perfection until the last stone from the last church falls on the head of the last priest.'
Palestine❤
Western fools were lecturing others about minority human rights, look whats happening to them now 😂
Did US Muslim marched against 9/11 attack?
Rural conservative America stands with Israel.
The world media is silent about the protests, in case they will offend the Jews. When you look at Veronica Nuland, Blinken, and Zelensky it's  no wonder every Country is protesting.
That's such a petty reporting on such a huge event.
WHY?? What the hell are you going to accomplish by marching around with your signs in DC?!?! If you people REALLY, TRULY, GENUINELY cared you’d take your  little signs and your marching boots and go do that same thing over in Gaza, or Palestine, or Isreal, or wherever!! But not a single one of you care enough to do that! What is happening over there is absolutely horrible and heartbreaking, nobody disagrees with that.    But let’s be realistic for a second. Standing around in the streets holding up signs, DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!! It’s called Virtue Signaling. You are doing no good. You are making ZERO impact on what’s going on over there.  Go for a bike ride, go fishing, hang out and watch a movie, go for a hike, go shopping, etc. go live life because you only get one. Yet, for some reason people think it’s a good idea to go stand around holding signs. Guess what? Every single one of those people involved in that march….when they lay down in their beds at night and close their eyes, all that time that day they spent chanting and standing around holding signs…made zero positive impact on the situation they claim to care so much about. Sorry but that’s the hard truth reality.

Get them gone and Liberal Jewish people STOP SUPPORTING them with your Democrat Votes you vote against your selves

It’s no different than IRA No Different then Nazis No Different if it were the klan
300k people  Wow
This is so good to see. This is what makes us humans.
No Mosques In America  No hajibs In America And Black Americans you are free and should be  deported from America if you support Islam bulldoze Oakland..And get them Gone MAGA TRUMP
Thank you for helping Palestinians! They don't get much help from others. They want to live in peace with thier families and pets!!  Palestinians are not hamas.  Just like not every Israeli likes the prime minister of Israel. Calling Palestinians terrorists is racist.  Most people weren't alive in Palestine to vote differently   Jesus would support Palestine, with the poor
Get the Pig UN out of America.Close this country  MAGA TRUMP and get these rags gone for good
Sheikh Ahmad Adoan, a Muslim scholar living in Jordan, wrote on his personal Facebook page that there is no such country as Palestine in the Koran, and Allah entrusted the promised Land to the Jews before the Day of Judgment (according to the Koran, Surah 5, verse 21), and "the sons of Israel will inherit (the country)" (Quran, surah 26, verse 59). "I say this to everyone who distorts the great book of Allah – the Quran! Where did you get this name – Palestine? You are liars, you are cursed. Allah has already used the term "Promised Land" and bequeathed it to the sons of Israel before the Day of Judgment. There is no such country as Palestine in the Koran. Your words that this land belongs to you are nothing but a lie that is a threat to the Koran, the Israeli people and the country. Therefore, your efforts will not be crowned with success, and Allah will disappoint and humiliate you, since he will stand up for the Jews." "It is a great honor for the Jews that Allah chose them from all the peoples of the world," the Sheikh added: "The Palestinians are the killers of children, the elderly and women. They attack the Jews and then hide on the backs of children, women and the elderly, not feeling sorry for them at all, as if they were not their children. They do this in order to show the whole world how the Jews want to kill them. I saw this with my own eyes in the 1970s. When they attacked the Jordanian army, they sent their children forward so that the whole world would think that the Jordanians were killing children. Such behavior is in their blood, it is their crime. Their hearts are like a stone, they are trying to manipulate public opinion to get support."
Brave to all the people who attended this pro-Palestine march in Washington D.C. 👍👍 The mainstream media's attempts at brainwashing people into believing that apartheid Israel is the 'victim' has failed. Israel is a terrorist state that is committing genocide in Palestine with the help of the US government. Millions of young people worldwide refuse to fall for their government's lies. Palestine will be free and Israel will answer for it's crimes. 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Since when do we negotiate with terrorists? If you let terrorists in you are a terrorist?
mashaallah from. srilanka
Free Palestine ❤❤❤❤
Over a 100,000 not just thousands.😊
Even if you 1000 rallies it doesn't make any difference.
Woow this gives me goosebumps...americans people was so heart warming❤as a human with a humanity sense..i can feel this vibe..thank you people YOU'RE action so Extraordinary..as long as there are still humanitarian fighters like you..Humanity will never die ✊🎉🎉
I am so loving the democrats at war with each other lol. You got the uneducated left wing soy boys and blue hair Karen’s that can’t fit into society on one side and the educated sane moderates and liberals who support Israel on the other side. This is great. Can’t wait until election time. The true liberals in the party now see how nuts the left wing truly are and they are distancing themselves. They are just as crazy as the right wingers now lol.
Biden= 1 term president
Yet hamas leader sitting in their fancy penthouse drinking fine wine waiting till they win it all
I congratulate the rally where conscientious people came together. A more just world is possible
🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸❤
Shame on Ukraine  👍 to 198 countries, Biden, we will remember, Voting time is coming up soon
There are not "thousands" protesting here, but quite obviously tens of thousands, perhaps more than 100,000.
السلام عليكم انت وانا بنتين واحده انت وانا نكون اسره وارجع الاثنين ما تتكون اسره قسم الطير بذكر وانثى الطير اسم الطير بذكر وانثى الديك بالدجاجه والديك قسم الاسد ايوب اسد ايوب بالاسد وقسم النمر محمد نمر محمد بالنمره بالنمره انثى وطيره النكته ريشه واحترف النساء قوامه على الرجال وراها للفستان ياكل وراها للبستان ياكل وانت اصبحت ام اول اسره طير ياما انا وانت تحل البشر شيء يضيع هذا البشر بستان قله انت ملك البستان وانا حلق بالجو اي مكان اشوفه ضعيف انزل عليهم بكيا عاليا وصوتا عاليا انا لا احب نفسي الطير والديك علموني ضحكه الدجاجه غفره اغضبت الرجال كلها
The long strip of paper was the name of the 10,000 people that died 💔
Apartheid never goes down gently...
Are all those people Hamas too?! #FreePalestine 🇵🇸
If they could protest like this when Hamas butchered innocents, they would have gathered a lot more support. Can’t believe some of these people were celebrating OCT 7th
How is this allowed? BLM protects were for the inequalities in the US not about a foreign war.
Free palestain
Should of came together like this to protest our tax money going overseas....our country is going down the toilet an their worried about /Hamas/Israel?? Let them handle their business an let us worry about cleaning up our own backyard!
Yet their in favor of funding the war in Ukraine 😂
Lemmings out to play. So many young people. Many who are barely post-prepubescent. Most have no skin in the fight and will return to their video games the next day. The teeth-gnashing anger they foster among one another is an adrenaline rush of orgasmic proportions. The reward of the rush is worth the arrogance required to cover up their ignorance.
Most of the people there are prob not even American citizens and are here on visas. These people need to get on a plane and go to the Middle East and help directly instead of protesting here. These mobs gather everyday so obviously no one works and must be wealthy enough to fly themselves over to help and volunteer their precious time directly to their causes. These protests deserve zero media coverage.
Evil plain and simple. God protect Israel and protect America . These human trash in this pro Palestine protest had Nazi flags disgusting . Democrat supporters . Hope the FBI was there .
Go to Gaza and fight for Palestine. Get out  of USA
Who wouldve thought that importing millions of people who hate America, and hate Americans would result in a scene like this?
soro's funded protest...
Wow, they support Nasi... Hitler would be proud of them.
You are protesting for ideas in muslins countries where you don’t even have the right to protest!!  What is next marching in America to install sharia law? Sick
The truth always wins. Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Thats funny, rallying at the White House, when the US is funding the war, think the protestors are barking up the wrong tree😅
Biden and his puppet masters are sweating now. Whatever will they do now ?
Ain't it funny how the news shows how Palestinians are suffering but fall to show how they continue to launch rockets at Israel. Do you think Israelis aren't dying? They whine about being surrounded,  Israel is surrounded by Muslims. In the end GOD will protect Israel.
That looks like a lot more than ‘thousands’
No wonder it was so hard to leave yesterday!!! ❤️🇵🇸❤️
When the rich and powerful countries in the world support the genocide of "others", then humanity is doomed.
If Hamas wants a ceasefire, all they have to do is return the hostages. Why haven't they done that?
Thirty thousand marched in Washington to demand a ceasefire. That's too few. Over 100,000 marched in Washington against the war in Iraq. That wasn't enough. The politicians in Washington don't represent the People. They represent rich donors and corporations. Let's not forget that.
But somehow this will be considered antisemitic...
To those thousands of protesters in the USA,  if you really care for the children in Gaza,  then all of you should be in Gaza and let all Palestinians kids be in the USA.
President of Brazil: Gaza is subjected to a genocidal war Brazilian President Lula da Silva described the Israeli war on the Gaza Strip as genocide, and while Spanish Acting Minister of Social Rights Ione Pellara called on European countries to sever diplomatic relations with Israel, Amnesty International said that the threats of the Israeli occupation army ordering the residents of northern Gaza to forcibly displace them may amount to To war crimes. She emphasized, "This problem is not a war. This is a genocide, which caused the death of nearly two thousand children who had nothing to do with what was happening. They were originally victims in this conflict." The president had considered that the attack The attack launched by the military wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas in Operation Al-Aqsa Flood does not give Israel the right to “kill millions of innocent people.”
Thank-you!
Wow look at all those Nazis
Enough is enough! Justice for Palestine!
Good to see that not all of the Americans are zombies
We used to receive this kind of support back in the Vietnam war. We stand with Palestine
Amazing! This is what we need. Together we are stronger 💪 ❤
this worse than Jan.6 ,  there supporting terroist ,   do the hostages get a cease fire ?
Time for real true Americans to think about how we will ultimately have to handle the terrorists sympathizers protesting in our streets... Are we going to wait till they do something to us like they did Israel... I know this much if your against Israel,your against God.. God will never ever forsake Israel... I don't think we should have to put up with this here in America of all places.. This is not going to end well.. 🙏🇮🇱🙏🇺🇸🙏
Remember when the world was once enslaved by muslims...lol
Shame on Israel.
What a disgusting sight, look at all those Nazis. Palestinian supporters they are not.
Crap. Don’t ceasefire until the hostages are set free, then surrender un coditionally
Free Palestine ✡️🇦🇺🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Love and respect for people coming out in support of Palestine
Where is DC?
Here's your corrected headline: "Thousands rally in support of Islamic extremist ideology, anti-semitism and bigotry."
Islamic invasion of civilised world in slow motion If Arabic countries use their wealth to peace it wouldn't happen
If we approach it from this perspective, I wonder about the reaction that the American and British people should have had in the face of the jointly conducted massive bombing operations on Nuremberg on the night of January 2, 1945, which resulted in the loss of 1,794 lives, over 3,000 wounded, and the displacement of 100,000 people. I also wonder about the case of Dresden from February 13 to 15, 1945, where a devastating fire ravaged a large part of the city, resulting in between 35,000 and 220,000 casualties, among others. Unless I am mistaken, it is estimated that there were 3,210,300 excess deaths directly or indirectly related to the war between May 1939 and September 1950 in the German civilian population, which accounts for 18.9% of the total population. Should American and British citizens have mobilized to express their disapproval of such events? Ultimately, how can one combat absolute evil without causing collateral victims? On a personal level, I find myself without an answer and I am open to being enlightened by those with a deeper understanding than mine.
Amen Amen Amen🙏🙏🙏🙏🎉🎉🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲
American are millions so thats is minority. If they want to protest go to Gaza and face IDF..
Without funding no one on road Must government enquire their accounts and groups socalled NGOs or rights activities 😅😅😅
I see hundred of thousands 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
The more I look throw these comments the more I realize how anti-semitic the world is. I thought the 1940's where over, but I guess not
- What about Yemen sectarian civil war how many people have died there  - What about Syria and the civil war there  -Lebanon is a mess waiting for a sectarian conflict  - Libya and its dual government and warlords  -Iraq already has sectarian civil war and continue to have tension in Kurdish area  -Pakistan just used the current crisis to expel 1.4 million afghan refugees back to Taliban den way more people are going to die when to return to -Afghanistan just by lack of basic facilities  there if not by Taliban rule.  -120 thousand Armenian have fled the Azerbaijani forces and Nagorno Karaba is ethnically cleansed  - Morocco and Western Sahara and the horror show there -Iran and it’s great morality police. Masha Ameni have u guys forgotten her already  - soon there will be conflict between Iran and Afghanistan for water resources   - let’s not go into Uighur Muslims in Chinese camp apparently they don’t exist for wider Muslim world because of geo political need for China. - why didn’t the world March for Yazidi when their men were killed and women made into slaves like in medieval times by ISIS  What’s happening to Palestinian is horrible thing but so are above issues. As long as organization like Hamas and fundamental radical belief exist there will never be peace in that part of the world. Just Check how many have dies in those above conflict the only difference is they are not televised like this horror in Gaza nor do they have geo political importance like Israel Palestine conflict. We can never really understand these issues from western Liberal lens. If the power dynamic change Hamas will do even more bombing on Israeli citizen.
First the Palestines?in Gaza sent a missile to Israel & when Israel gave the medicines they were asking for..the Palestinians wanted a ceasefire who's the real Commando in all this chaos

Look at those people gathered in one place......that's a hamas terrorists wet dream.
Humanity is for human beings not for animals to kill human! The major American TV networks channel are too afraid of get censor because supporting Humanity!
Twenty seconds! Come on ,
And we only see this now, I can’t imagine the past +70 years.  Better late than nothing.
Save Children 😢😢😢
#STOPTheApartheidOfPalestians  ...  #FREEFreePalestine
😢😢😢
Where's the Protests for all the Killing in Syria?  It's Muslims who celebrate rape and the murder of children!
❤️❤️❤️🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸💪💪💪
VIVA  PALESTINA  ✌✌✌✌
This protest is worse than covid
Another mob gathering ....
Free Palestine 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸❤️
You think this is bad? Y'all should see how brainwashed Ireland and Scotland are, sucks for the UK to have such extremist and anti semitic neighbors... Yet Ireland and Scotland call themselves Christian nations? Pfff ya right, how can you say you love Jesus if you don't love Israel? I say any country in the west who supports terrorism over Israel should be kicked out of NATO and the EU and be exiled, boycotted and sanctioned against!
Hundred thousands*
ceasefir now
That's crazy. All these people must not know what is actually  going on to support a religious hate group. H*mas fired on Isr*el and they are still firing rockets to this day, but Cease fire? Makes no sense if they are still firing. H*mas blocked it's citizens from leaving to hide amongst them to act like civilians even when Isr*el told the citizens to leave. Everyone needs to search what is actually going on rather than saying it's Humanitarian issue when it's not.
There was a ceasefire on the 6th of October.
It’s brilliant to see British people standing up against Nazis.  I honestly thought the British were bystanders until this
Go home flag burners and haters. 🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱💙💙💙
Yeah, thousands of morons. Idiots, one and all. None of them live in a war-zone. None of them has a vested, stake in anything other than being liberal and, stupid. Put these losers in a real, fight and, they'd run screaming. They'd cower in fear and, cry. They'd gnash their teeth and, piss themselves. They'd scream, "You can't do this to us! We have rights!" then, freeze in shock and sputter as they saw their fellow, whiners die at the hands of a terrorist. Their minds would break and, they'd retreat from reality as their tiny, privileged, minds break from the cold, truth of reality.
Sleepy Joe wakeup.
How about asking Hamas to surrender and release hostages.
In my opinion, don't have a state for Israel and Palestine, just form a world state and it is neutral for all religions to worship like a colony, there is no partiality and in the future there will be no more war and suffering from Palestine and Israel.
They make Hamas their new icon while Hamas is coming for them, the elite is behind this protest, want terrorist to rule, so that they csn step in and be the hero's. This sick world
Imagine calling for death to all Jews and then calling for a ceasefire. You’re perfectly aligned with BLM.
Bullshit humanity
Will people power free civilisation from the tyranny of Western governments? If so , then we can worry about climate change.
What a miscalculation by the oppressors this time the world is awaken and refuses to be fooled anymore
That is millions
American progressives always lead a charge from the rear of the battle
War is killing a lot kids
When humanity speaks across border ❤
There were over a million people at this protest. I can’t say I’m surprised they want to suppress it. It was truly amazing
I am happy that the people of the country know the struggle of Palestinians, I think this solidarity with Palestine is one the strongest I have seen since I was born, and I thank all of the people who understand the pain of others, and who understand the terrible truth, the shame, the lies and the unhuman approach from almost all the governments in the world, for me I am happy that the people understand and know the truth. Still, I am saddened to see Politics stepping on humanity once again.  may this world be in peace, and may we all wake up one day and decide to make a real change to our world and to ourselves.   March with family, friends there is sweetness in small or big effort, stubborn hope always trumps lazy greed & gentle hearts tear vulgar castles down. Don’t be afraid , don’t be afraid .  A word from a Syrian who is displaced somewhere on earth.
Palestinians people just want to live in peace.....by International laws Israeli settlers are illegal in west bank....then how US and West political leaders supporting this crime...I don't know ..... hypocrite behaviour of this so called democratic elected world leaders at peak.
What dopes, go protest in gaza for hamas to surrender, that's the only way to your cease fire.
I need to see a sign that says that Palistine denounces Hamas!!  I dont see it 😐
I wonder why all of these people didn’t come out for the pro-Palestinian speech David Duke gave back in 2005. As usual, liberals find themselves angry and confused. Adolf Hitler’s defeat was the singular assurance of the creation of the state of Israel. What was it about “punching nazis” and all that? I’ve got an extra pair of khakis and a white polo you can wear.
Why can’t we march for our own country like this for people who deserve so much more recognition from our own people (American Indians).
If our country gets invaded these are people that would commit treason.
I wonder what it will take for the world to respond totally for a ceasefire..??? 1 million children dying or 2 million or more..!? Why are they waiting..? What are they waiting for..?😭
Huh. Factual report?. Hard to believe!. Show headless babies, then you will get noted, not this .
As a Muslim in the United States who works a lot of hours per week busy trying to pay my bills in this inflation lifestyle, I don’t know how so many protesters have free time and enough money to pay the bills and still be able protest on a daily basis.
Why aren’t these people protesting against Hamas?! Hamas is committing war crimes against their own people by hiding in civilian buildings including hospitals and schools. These people cannot be truly concerned about Palestinian lives while they are clearly failing to call Hamas out of the hiding
🙏🌍✌💛 Peace and LOVE for ONE and ALL
A beautiful sight! Wish I was there. 👍🥰
No peace without JESUS.. as soon as both groups have rejected Jesus, they get no peace.. Accept JESUS n peace will be granted
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
thank you DC
Save Americans $3.2 a year from thire txa money 👍
Hell of a lot of Nazi sympathizers we got there!
end the occupation, prevent the Ben Gurion Canal Project
WELL DONE TO THE REAL VOICE OF AMERICANS
Piss be upon them and Muhammad.
This is unbelievable! Way to go!
They never condemn Hamas for killing innocent people.
😂😢😅🎉
Prayers to Palestine
We have to keep  protest
We protested in London as well. Free Palestine!!!! 🇵🇸 🇵🇸 🇵🇸
#stopgenocideingaza #freepalestine
So apparently it’s ok for them to incite violence but not patriots just simply standing up for our own country.
🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Send these people to Gaza
Who cares how many terrorist sympathizers there are? Believing lies in large numbers does not make you right. Not so long ago it was a majority who thought the world was flat. It only serves to demonstrate that idiots are louder and more violent. Believing anyone supporting Israel wants dead Palestinian children as well as adults is proof positive you are incapable of critical thinking.
So may terrorists and rape justifiers ..and they call themselves humanitarian progressive
My local channels are completely ignoring this. I never would have known about this if it weren't for the Internet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
THIS LIKE THE NUREMBURG RALLIES IN 1930S GERMANY ****************************************************************************************
Looks like millions
So many brainwashed imbeciles commenting. Poor, poor Palestine. Say nothing about Hamas, the ones who refused to allow civilians to leave Gaza. Same cowards as usual, afraid to condemn anything Islamic. Useful idiots who do exactly what Hamas set them up to do; see Israel as the enemy in the propaganda war by increasing civilian casualties as much as possible. How many of these terrorist sympathizers are citizens btw? If you are NOT, you have exactly ZERO right to protest, ZERO right to free speech; the Constitution and Bill of Rights do NOT apply to non-citizens. How can people be stupid enough to be incapable of seeing who TARGETS the innocent and who does not? Witness the easily manipulated. Always in liberal cities, and generally masked. Cowards.
All this people should move to Gaza and join Hamas, they are wasting their Time here in the US. War is not here. If you really want to help, go there.
Mass deportation is in order
Most this people never been in the middle east and they don't even know what's going.
Just "thousands"?? There were EASILY 100,000 people there today, and it might've been closer to 300,000.  This is why they say "the revolution will not be televised". The elites do NOT want you to know that the people aren't buying their bullshit
It's always a rally when leftists or minorities do it, but Jan 6 was extremists and  insurrection
More people than joe Biden’s inauguration 😂😂! These people are nuts! People should be arrested for climbing the fence and holding a foreign flag
Amin amin amin saudara saudaraku anak anak muda di dunia ini kita masih bersatu cintailah ibu mu semoga anak anak muda di dunia ini dalam lindungan Tuhan Allah amin amin amin semoga masyarakat kecil kami di pelistina dalam Ridonya tuhan Allah Amin amin amin
They are hiding the truth t.v.,will nit show
What a despicable site
The truth
um not thousands. HUNDEREDS of thousands. get it right. does that look like a thousand people to u?
Lots of hamas supporters I see
this is a proof that our leaders, the media or the west can not fool the world anymore. The truth is wide open .
I STAND WITH ISRAEL 🇮🇱 🇺🇸
Isn't the rally in support of Hamas?
Free Palestine!!! 🇵🇸🇵🇸 F these politicians who are owned and run by israel
90% can’t even find Palestine on a map.
These people should have given those brave men who courageously took over American air this same kind of love, reception and acceptance too.  We all know they did a much better job in the explosive business back in the days. So unfair America. They're heroes too after all right. America and the free world are becoming dum and dumber so goes with these dum naive young lost generation. Bravo!
"Ceasefire is to seize failure"! These guys probably got the tactic from "The art of war of Sun Tzu"--- delaying strategy!
All those who hate US while enjoying its blessing have come together!
Israel, Biden, Blinken, and Evil Netenyahu had a chance to bring peace to Palestine instead they chose Genocide, killing babies and moms, More than 4000 kids. This administration and Israel will pay for this.
usa should stop funding genocide war
I didn't see protesters when Hamas killed civilians in Izrael. Non of them protested that killing people and shouting Allah Akbar is not nice.
Free Palestinians from Hamas, America has sent Billions to Gaza and Hamas uses that money for weapons, Remember  over a 1000 rockets few into Israel, and Hamas beheaded babies and children. ISRAEL uses its rockets to defend its people, Hamas uses its people to defend its rockets.
So it is all about Muslims or about Palestine? How many of them are Muslims and how many are in US illegally?!
💚🤍🖤❤️
free palestine 🇵🇸
May I ask will Palestine ceasefire too, or it is just one sided request!?
Lots of Nazi's there
#freePalestine
We the people of this United States stands with the peoples of Israel ❤
Holy War 2.0
Politicians, don't help Israel in it's crime. Free Palestine.
It was sea of peoples, looks like media needs to correct its math !
The pro crime ignorant left.
Tens of Thousands attend pro-Palestinian rally in Washington DC slamming US President Biden
if the Americans still dont figure out who owns the media, the policies you have been living under the rock.
Bless the civilians, screw Hamas.
Geez
Both sides are wrong period this is all a planned set up by globalist to destroy humanity the USA needs to stay out of other peoples business
Send them all back to their land United States is for Israel
America is over. Just give America a new Arab name.
evil islamic hamas supporters
You should say millions not thousands
I was actually at this protest, and my daughter saw a drone.
Lame Americans wont’ protest for losing their country with open borders though
3 year old  Israeli boy kidnapped by Hamas after boy's parents were brutally slain by Hamas on Oct. 7.
Where the passion when millions are murdered through abortion???
There was a ceasefire in place. Until october the 7th.
Yet their will be done regardless of all these peaceful protestors.
I was there to interview those people. I saw quit a few MAGA hats and Trump shirts. They told me democrats lost their votes with the trans lgtbq agenda
How’s your resistance going for you today?
We stand with Israel 🇮🇱
Israel is genocide in Gaza. We all who love human should stop Israel making genocide.
Berlin 1945.Gaza 2023. Same Nazis.Same End.
That’s a lot of Jew Hatin MoFos. 🧐
Proud to have been there. 🇵🇸🇺🇸🇵🇸🇺🇸🇵🇸🇺🇸🇵🇸
Why should it be on mass media?. Israel is a tiny country. did u see any mass protest when Assad killed over a million Muslims ? did u see any protest when thousands of innocent Muslims are being killed by other Muslims? why is the world so outraged when Israel defends themselves against the Hamas monsters???
but they support hamas terrorism
Bless you all ❤❤❤❤❤
Hamas has caused this NOT Israel. They butchered civilians, they hide behind the innocent Palestinians, Hamas are cowards!!!!!
EVIL NETANYAHU IS A WAR CRIMINAL COMPARABLE TO HITLER
♥️✌🏼🇵🇸
The vote the day before yesterday to stop the war at the UN is interesting. Out of 198 countries, opposite United States, Israel. Ukraine abstains. The rest of the country is in favor.
People wants communism
Are you protesting to let the hostages go? Or protesting to let the terrorrist win?
Look at all those Anti-Semites.
Free Palestine from oppression, occupation, immense cruelty and genocide, the message to genocide sympathisers is all lives matter including Palasteinine lives. Evil Netanyahu is committing genocide and war crimes and the fake paid MSM and world leaders are sitting back and watching these atrocities happen, their hypocrisies are astonishing. Palestinians have been caged in like animals in an open prison by Israel but where is the outcry there from these pathetic biased hypocrites.
🤡
Well, there have been protests around the world with thousands attendees in support of Israel and against antisemitism which has been spreading also at these Palestinian protests. The Palestian flag has become a symbol of support of Jewish genocide. Extrelemly bad for the Palestinian cause.
This is disgusting; Israel has the right to brutality defend its brutal occupation.
That's the USA we're all done
When Trump will be back they will be deported 😂
no politician that is for arming israel is going to get my money or my vote.  it's called moral hazard, and I simply will sit this election out.  the supreme court is lost, and there is no more emergency that the democrats can blackmail me with any more.  we are on our own; the completely zionist-owned politicians of both parties are not worthy of ANY support.
All are cowards....need to be banned from Usa
Israel's ambassador to Ireland should be expelled until a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is imposed, Sinn Féin has said.  The party has changed its stance after previously stopping short of calling for the measure.  Sinn Féin had faced some criticism over its position, including from the SDLP and People Before Profit.  On Friday, party president Mary Lou McDonald said the deepening scale of the crisis means sanctions are needed.  Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said there will be no temporary ceasefire until Israeli hostages are released from Gaza.  Israel began bombing Gaza after Hamas killed more than 1,400 people in Israel and kidnapped more than 200 others on 7 October.  The Hamas-run health ministry has said more than 9,000 people have subsequently been killed in Gaza.  "Our approach has been ceasefire from the get-go and we're not outliers in that regard," Mrs McDonald said.  "That is the international law which remains our priority but as Israel turns its face away from that call for ceasefire, as the crisis deepens and the violence becomes all the more intense, clearly, there has to be a consequence here in Ireland."
Liberate the world from superstitious harmful religious belief.. End antirationalism and reasonophobia...
🇵🇸🇬🇧👍👍
If this can happen in the US, remember these same people who supports Hamas and their ideology can attack our country, our govt is failing us, god forbid some of these people might be radicalized and must be part of terror cells
Thousands……only😂😂
Wow! Amazing
what about the views of  the millions of folk that was not there,
Only if democracy was not just a word...
*hundreds of thousands, it was a couple hundred thousand people. MSM is the plague. A bunch of Israeli lackies. All of them are traitors to America.
That will wake up Biden
Ignorant Fools. When you go against God's chosen people, you go against The True & Living God of the Bible. Good luck with that. By the way, luck doesn't exist.
❤🇪🇭
Soul Searching, can not be stupid
We’re fcuked in America too thanks to democrats but I can rest at night knowing I’m practicing my second amendment right.
Not a single Muslim protested or carried out any demonstration against Russia in favour of Ukraine..... What about that ??? Muslims were happy even when Russia invade Ukraine because all Muslims are anti Europe regardless living in Europe
The number of people was more than 300.000 and still it will get neglected from the western media..
Its a proof of presence of true hearted peoples in d worlds ...❤
We let ‘en in oh well
I'm not being sarcastic or confrontational, but I do have a few questions. What happens to all the Jews living in Palestine when it's liberated? They aren't going to live under or obey Islamic law under any circumstances, and they surely aren't going to leave willfully. I mean logistically, how do you handle that? Do you murder them all, because that's what you will have to do? They have enough weapons to resist. So how do you intend to "Free Palestine"?

Why didn't the fbi  know about this
Maybe in next few years, Israel will align to China for support as US is increasingly unreliable.
#israelwarcrimea is worse than the Germans NAZIS from 1945
#Israel ❤️🇮🇱
USA is making the peace process in Aman.
Israel
Th3se people need to get out of usa
When does Hitler speak?
BRAVO!!!! THE WORLD IS NOT BLIND, WE SEE YOU😮😮😮😮
Is this iran or us?
Biggest crowd of fools seen in awhile.  Palestinians were the ones dancing in the streets on 9/11.
Callous Fools! What about the hostages!? No talk of ceasefire till Hamas releases their hostages.
Pro Palestian/Hamas= Anti-América. Let’s NOT forget the American soldiers that died in Iraq/Afghanistan for the same IDEOLOGY as Hamas!
Это где?
disgusting
"Thousands" It's always "thousands" but never "tens of thousands" or "hundreds of thousands".
A little shepherd boy, David defeated Goliath of the Philistine army with only a sling and stone just imagine how easy it is going to be for Yeshua Hamaschiach/Jesus Christ The Messiah when that day arrives.
jews have become nazis
Why only 21 seconds 🤔🙄😳😏😂🤣🤣🤣
IT IS SICKENING HOW THE MEDIA CHANGES THE NARATIVES IN THE TITILES. TO DOWNPLAY THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSAND IN DC AND THE MILLIONS ACCROSS THE WORLD. You should be ashamed!
ISRAEL FOREVER.

Try hundreds of thousands.
From the river to the Sea!!!!!
YOU PEOPLE CLAIM YOU GOT FREEDOMS BUT YOUTUBE WON'T LET ANYBODY SPEAK PUTIN WAS RIGHT

Israël killed 6000 chilldren 😢😢😢
Israël killed chilldren 😢😢
These are not 'normal' and certainly not peaceful  protests.  This is globally  coordinated. Civilians and police have been hurt on camera, protestors are aggressive to anyone who carries get in their way, yelling for holy war and intimidating ordinary people. Govt and the Met are weak, woke and useless.
BLAME TOMMY ROBINSON FOR THIS YOUTUBE CENSORING BS YOUTUBE IS FINISHED
ИЗРАИЛ ТЕРОРИСТ ОКУПАНТ

LOL... YT is censoring comments that support cease ---- fire
The governments and the media are the enemy

Activists are gonna be activists. Gotta get their new fix of virtue signaling. Funny how police brutality vanished. I wonder what will be the next cause?
Damn fools
A muslim gathering
Western civilization is over.
You mean thousand of Muslims standing with hammas in DC
That's a very sad day for America that we have that many stupid people here
Allahuakbar
I can't believe how sick this stuff is and in the US, who are these people ? I am native American and I think the only people that can claim genocide would be jews and native Americans I am reminded of my ancestors and their villages being raided and babies were burned alive and their heads bashed in so they could save bullets the woman raped and the elders dismembered so I stand with Israel
They had a ceasefire on october 6th...what did they do on 7th ? No more.
❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤
Speaking of numbers, it's tens of thousands of people. Not just thousands.
20 seconds? For the biggest protest in US history?
Humanity ❤❤❤
Where is fox and cnn the blind eye
🇦🇪🇦🇪🇦🇪🇦🇪🫶
It’s wild that the other news are not showing any of this
free free palestine✌✌
👏👏👏❤
I think most people are against the ethnic cleansing live on TV but sure, pro-palestain sounds better for american propaganda I guess...🤷🤣
Protest against Hamas who escalated this situation.
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
They are all Philistines.  👀. Don’t forget David the little Shepard boy.  We know how it ended for Goliath and his army.
RELEASE THE HOSTAGES OR SHUT YOUR MOUTHS!
Why would Israel want a state of terrorists next to it since when did the murdering Palestinians have a state. Including a religious war the Muslims want to eat America and Europe with the method of refugees and immigrants who will destroy them from the inside whoever wants terrorists in their country is welcome to take the Palestinians to their country thank you
We will Never Forget the Genocide! worst than holecast
It's a beautiful sight indeed if that is a peaceful rally with a goal for peace and unity to Palestine and Israel. But sadly it seems Israel is firm on their stand to avenge their loss due to a massacre done by Hamas led Palestinian.
Go away! We don't need you protesting here, go wherever you came from and protest there, you bunch of foreigners.
This is interesting even for conservatives!! Why are yu all liking this? It doesn't do anyone good
They don’t care even they see millions of people protesting
Free free Palestine  by stop the war now 😢
Including Hamas which Palestine gave safe harbor for years and Russia for Ukraine and China for the Uyghurs and Turkey for Armenians, and Africa/ Arabia for slave trade and on and on and on.
How's it liberty when this certain group set up shop in the poorest community's meaning African Americans selling them products like rotten meat and vegetables and stale cigarettes and calling them infidels in their native tongue And most are upset we can create a look a like of them with a white woman or Hispanic kinda like a Colin Kaepernick look Patrick mahomes look Beyonce look and Prince it bothered them psychology so deep rooted dislike they all laughed at the poorest communitys people called them savages because they're angry we'll seems everybody angry now where are the words of a savage their words Rodney King can we all just get along.
How many people?
Could be Glastonbury 2025 ..👀
Correction:   Thousands rally in  support of Hamas  and a 'cease fire' that  will   keep  it  power.
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Why is this in the US? Is the US bombing the Gaza Strip to get rid of Hamas terrorists?
Can anyone tell me when Palestine was a soverign nation before 1948?
Everyone has the right to be wrong
Israel has the right, hamas is responsible for attack
🙏 🤲🇵🇸🤲 🙏
The western world isnt playing ball with  the citizens of usa uk in the sense that this type of biblical realms are beyond the west KEEP THE WEST OUT OF Troubles
Zionists are war criminals
When the whole world blame Israel as oppressor, there is no one care about the hostages Hamas took, and no one talk about the massacre of Israelis; villages. If Palestinians think what Hamas have done is right, they are ignorant and violent. The financial aids from Western world has used for constructing underground tunnels under Gazan' houses and schools and hospital, not for the improving of Palestinians' life. Now they accuse Israel of bombarding Gaza, but say no word to Hamas' preventing Gazans retreat from Gaza.
قال تعالى: ((إِنَّا لَنَنصُرُ رُسُلَنَا وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَيَوْمَ يَقُومُ الْأَشْهَادُ)) الصبر يا غزة والله لا يخلف وعده🌺
This is happening in every major city.
Merdeka Palestina !! Terimaksaih Saudara Saudariku di DC in pro-Palestinian, kalaian Luar biasa . Merdeka Palestina !!  Merdeka Palestina !!  Merdeka Palestina !!....
That’s great but are they going to DO something?
Crazy everyday Millions of people came out to show the biggest feeling in the history of the whole world out to support Palestine
Beautiful to see but will it move people at the top to stop the bombing? Doubtful, there are far greater stakes at work here then people want to realize.
Respect!
Useful idiots.
But politicians have invested in arms companies, they need wars, you see?
Dissent is not disloyalty.  Civil protest is a required for a healthy democracy, a natural human right, guaranteed by the US Constitution.  Use it. Don’t abuse it. Else we can lose it. Liberty freedom and justice for all humans.
Imagine where we are. Media and politicians shrugs about 3000 kids being killed.
Wow
Boycott Israel American businesses to stop funding genocide
Free free palastine
ALIANS
What has happened to the USA 🇺🇸 that said #NeverForget on 9/11? These haters of Jews and believers of a Islamic death 💀 cult are free to hate the country they live in and threaten Jewish lives. Anyone who doesn’t think those of us who don’t believe in the Stone Age religion won’t be attacked again on our own land are blind!
Free world from zionist
Free Palestine
👍👍👍👍👁😭😭😭😭😭❤❤❤
From   Albany NY , FREE PALESTINE NOW , DO IT NOW !!!
They aren't really covering this. I have been looking for it.
Support Palestina. ❤
I am relieved to see that people are smarter and more humane than their politicians 👏👏👏
There is no peace in the world apart from Jesus Christ. Won’t you turn to Him and ask Him to forgive your sins and to heal you and to have the only correct relationship with God? ✝️
The Israeli state, under International Law, is the “Belligerent Occupying Power”. It is also a colonialist power and a colonialist settler state. It has perpetrated many ethnic cleansing, war crimes and colonialist crimes over many years and decades against the Palestinians.
Why are people concerned with something that’s nothing to do with them.
Sheep
Its for the poor innocent  Palestinians  people dying, no water,  no electricity,  no food

Bravo Americans! Free Palestine.☮ Love from the United Kingdom.❤

Palestine will be free no matter how hard they try to kill us.
ربي انصر عبادك المؤمنين واهزم اليهود المغضوب عليهم
Protest of the month club 😂😂. Loser convention.
Какие вы молодцы
Never knew we had that many confused people in America...
That's only the tip of a growing ice berg of people open their eyes and  facing sad truth
Mainstream media not covering this.
Total solidarity, respect and love to the people of Palestine, now and forever, from Reykjavik, Iceland ❤
Free Palestine
Liberdade,liberdade, abra as asas sobre nós ❤❤❤❤
Free Palestine.   Anyone who is offended by those two words is a closeted racist and an ignorant bigot. Wanting Palestinians to be free and not under the yoke of an apartheid regime is NOT the same as being antisemitic. It is irresponsible and brainless to make that association. The Israeli government is a fascist and authoritarian regime that is responsible for the deaths of over 10,000 Palestinians in this recent conflict alone! Shame on anyone who supports the wanton killing of innocent Gaza civilians.
A wonderful moment. The pro-Israel politicians across the western world are not having it all their own way.
Free Palestine
We out hereeeee free Palestine and all the oppressed brothers and sisters around the world❤
❤️🇵🇸❤️🇵🇸❤️🇵🇸❤️🇵🇸
End the occupation
Except these are 100s of thousands! BS media will always be BS!
Free free free Palestine 🇵🇸 ❤
Pathetic
Corporate Media would rather cover riots and smear the DAs of big cities for the crime rate.
FREE PALESTİNA FROM TÜRKİYE 🇹🇷🇯🇴👍❤️
Never forget October 7th. Palestinians showed us who they really are
That’s lakhs and not thousands
These racists are the reason MLK found out.
Free Palestines God bless you and all human people
I cannot WAIT to see how the establishment politicians talk their way around this...
Palestine has never existed, its only been tolerated. That is over now.
Where is CNN
u let so many terrorist supporters in ur country, very bad move.
👍✌️
Hey America... You're f*cked 😂
Amen
400 million in the USA 🤷‍♂️
🇺🇸💪🇮🇱🇺🇸💪🇮🇱🇺🇸💪🇮🇱🇺🇸💪🇮🇱
Nice to see unity of all nations and beliefs for our co civilians that is suffering now in Gaza and refugee camps
What a sight to behold
People of the world has gone through recent catastrophic events:  1. Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. 2. Russia-Ukraine War in 2022. 3. Palestine Hamas-Israel war in 2023.  It is understandable that people around the world speak up, went unrest, and protest. People just want to live in peace, good economics, healthy, etc. War just bringing destruction to human lives.
What a waste of time.   You think protesting is gonna change anything then you are delusional.  Zionist own the U.S.  wake up and smell the coffee people.
😌
It's truly scary how many people think this is about Gaza. This is a show of strength before pushing for Sharia law. For the country that suffered 9/11 it is astonishing. They hate you. Your support should be fully behind Israel.
I was on the fence and remained silent before but considering how much I'm being censored,  am now fully backing Palestine and have determined this is the right side of history to be on.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
If the US was up in flames, the middle east would be celebrating. The Islamic world could careless about the west. Yet ppl in the west mindlessly support a group that would otherwise despise them.  Yes u can have empathy, but know that the middle east would have no support for the west if it was us in turmoil.  Arabs celebrated 9, 11. But i guess this generation of kids dont know that or care.
#CEASEFIRENOW ❤
Let us all free Palestine during this lifetime...let us all correct the injustices done by the past generations
this is what they do... What is the war between Palestine and Jordan?  In 1970, a conflict broke out between the Jordanian Armed Forces led by King Hussein and the Palestine Liberation Organization led by Yasser Arafat. This conflict was known as Black September. After the war, Jordan expelled the PLO.
True face of liberty and freedom. These people took time from their day to lend their voice. To the people being besieged and bombarded. 3000 kids have died, and this is for them You are America You are humanity  And your voices matter and will not be silenced 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Why palestine attacks Israel and kill people?
Alhamdulillah Mahsha Allah Insha Allah ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Free Palestine ❤❤❤
“Do not keep silent… God! Do not hold Your peace… Your enemies… have taken crafty counsel against Your people (Israel) ...and consulted together saying “Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation, that the name of Israel may be remembered no more.” Psalms 83:1-4 I will BLESS them that bless you , and CURSE him that curses you,  and in you shall all families of the earth be blessed” Genesis 12:3  “So pursue them with Your tempest, And frighten them…Fill their faces with shame… Yes, let them be put to shame and perish” Psalms 83:15-17
22 Arab Nations (475 million) with a land area 640 times larger than Israel, and a population 60 times bigger than Israel (9.3 million).  How can Israel, which occupies only 0.15% of the lands called Arab, be responsible for the dissatisfaction of all 22 Arab nations?
If they REALLY cared, they should ALL be going to fight. These are just spoiled rotten little brats.
May God bless Israel 🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏🙏
I wish them all safe passage to Palestine to support their loved ones and fight for what they obviously feel passionate about.
Beautiful view of liberty and freedom.
President Biden, who has Alzheimer's, is a killer
El mundo condena el genocidio de Israel y va a pagarlo.
Hamas started a war- Now they have one.
ZEPHANIAH 2 A Call to Repentance 1Gather yourselves together, yes, 4For Gaza shall be forsaken, And Ashkelon desolate; They shall drive out Ashdod at noonday, And Ekron shall be uprooted. 5Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast, The nation of the Cherethites! The word of the Lord is against you, O Canaan, land of the Philistines: “I will destroy you; So there shall be no inhabitant.” 6The seacoast shall be pastures, With shelters for shepherds and folds for flocks. 7The coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; They shall feed their flocks there; In the houses of Ashkelon they shall lie down at evening. For the Lord their God will intervene for them, And return their captives. 8“I have heard the reproach of Moab, And the insults of the people of Ammon, With which they have reproached My people, And made arrogant threats against their borders. 9Therefore, as I live,” Says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, “Surely Moab shall be like Sodom, And the people of Ammon like Gomorrah— Overrun with weeds and saltpits, And a perpetual desolation. The residue of My people shall plunder them, And the remnant of My people shall possess them.” 10This they shall have for their pride, Because they have reproached and made arrogant threats Against the people of the Lord of hosts. 11The Lord will be awesome to them, For He will reduce to nothing all the gods of the earth; People shall worship Him, Each one from his place, Indeed all the shores of the nations. 12“You Ethiopians also, You shall be slain by My sword.” 13And He will stretch out His hand against the north, Destroy Assyria, And make Nineveh a desolation, As dry as the wilderness. 14The herds shall lie down in her midst, Every beast of the nation. Both the pelican and the bittern Shall lodge on the capitals of her pillars; Their voice shall sing in the windows; Desolation shall be at the threshold; For He will lay bare the cedar work. 15This is the rejoicing city That dwelt securely, That said in her heart, “I am it, and there is none besides me.” How has she become a desolation, A place for beasts to lie down! Everyone who passes by her Shall hiss and shake his fist. The Holy Bible, New King James Version, Copyright © 1982 Thomas Nelson. All rights reserved.

Head of Israel's National Center of Forensic Medicine: "In 28 years, I can't recall such infernal damage. Babies, young children, without heads, without legs. I can't understand how the entire world doesn't grasp the sheer cruelty of this situation." What they are all these supporters.
Quote: When you see evil and do nothing, the effects of that evil will inevitably harm you one day.
Just like all people, they do deserve to be free. But that cant happen with Hamas. Hamas steals the aid for their own people and advocates for the elimination of all jewish people. They don't want peace for their people, they want a holy war and want to systematically eliminate those that dont allign with their religious ideals. Their abilitiy to understand the world hasnt advanced since the dark ages
This is the humanity!
💯🙏
The world must help the Palestinians to have their own land, which belongs to them, otherwise there will never be peace in the Middle East. Return every inch of the occupied territory.
Beautiful, ordinary people who stand up for the oppressed, unlike our cowardly politicians.
Viva PALESTINE

Yikes! Don't these people know that if they support the Palestinian people then they're all anti-Semites and Nazis?
you can listen to 3 hours of violent rhetoric live from their stage. the only reason they want a ceasefire is to buy hamas time to regroup. keep exposing yourself anti-semites, you'll be dealt with.
More than 3 thousand Palestinian children have been  killed the whole world is supposed to be against this not just Palestinians   #free_palestine 💙🇵🇸
Why are Palestinians labeled terrorists and Israelis are not? HINT: "Follow the Money."
Israël terroriste Free Gaza 🌹 Free Palestine 🇵🇸🇵🇸✌️
So many people support HAMAS terrorist organization,  whats wrong with this world ?
👹Israel is preventing fuel, medicine and food from entering Gaza by cutting off electricity and water. Of the 9,500 people who have been killed in Gaza so far. 70% of them are children and women🤦‍♂️
Now this is truly a BEAUTIFUL SIGHT TO BEHOLD.  Free Free Palestine.
Go people. Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Someone needs to remind these geniuses that Hamas doesn't want a ceasefire
Looks a lot more than "thousands"! Tens of thousands, at least
