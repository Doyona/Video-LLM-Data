Wynonna's joke cut the tension in the room. But her final prayer ... 😭
I still feel it’s sad that Naomi chose to end her life in the way she chose and to do so with Ashley on the property.I guess she didn’t want to be alone since her husband was out of town when it happened.We never truly know the struggles people go through as they can hide things so we’ll.RIP Naomi Judd
The day I saw Naomi in that pink dress, boobs hiked up…and the beehive wig, I turned to my husband and said, “Something is wrong with her.”  She was really despondent and couldn’t hold on another day.  Her song writing, and harmony was amazing.
Money helps.there are young moms with small kids and only making ends meet and doing it alone with mentel illness.with no help or money.them 3 ladies a filthy rich..they will do fine.hope they will donaye some of their wealth to mentel illness to find a cure.instead of pushing pills by big pharma.
we love 💕 y'all ok
I cannot even imagine.....🥀🥀🥀🥀♾️♾️♾️💓💓💓💓
She’s gone home, to Heaven, Jesus will wipe every tear from every eye ❤❤❤❤

My Heart Breaks for Wy and Ashley along with Larry as they suffer this great loss. Naomi Judd may you rest in the peace of Christ.  No more scars in heaven! The burden is lifted he holds it in his hands now.  Prayers for you all!  God Bless you and may his face shine upon you and give you peace.
I adore The Judds,Ashley included! Naomi was a Shero to me. She helped me with her openness about Depression and suicide! I love you,Naomi rest In heaven! Larry, Wy and Ashley, I love y’all too!
😪🕊🙏💜
God bless their families.  Suicide is so hard for the ones left behind.  The biggest question that they'll never get answered is "Why?"  It has been seven years since my love one left and the pain of not knowing is always always there.  When someone dies of a disease, you know why, you grieve, it's hard but you move on with your life.  When you don't understand why, you can't move on and you keep asking yourself "if only I had or hadn't done so many things differently, they would've stayed".  Please pray for these women to find peace.  I'm so so sorry.  Thank you for the wonderful music Naomi, you are loved and missed very much. ♥
OMG what happened to Ashley?  She used to be so beautiful!  You know what they say about being humbled by Karma..... how sad.
Ashley & Wynonna are are so Strong, girls we love you just keep singing Wynonna ❤ 💕
I have loved ya'll from day one. Always will.
So sorry for your loss Ashley and Wynonna I know it’s very hard at this time months and days will go by and u just can’t even comprehend how to get up in the morning without your mother I’ve been through that with my mother & father to tell only place she got a remember she’s in your heart she’s watching over you love both of you keep on thinking those beautiful songs never change your way or change the songs that you did together you women are very strong beautiful people you guys are down to earth I’ve never really followed you guys until recently. The passing of your mother and you guys in spring so much hope to my life because I experience a lot of things that you did again so sorry for your loss keep on doing what you do as sisters as family love each other every day to make your mom proud in heaven!😢❤️
Your mom is at peace. She is thanking.her beautiful children ❤️
Ahhh Wynonna. I know your pain.
I was borned and raised in Jackson county. I never knew  the Judds when they were there. I meet them through their music.  I loved them The humor were always so welcoming.. what strong person their mother was and what strong daughters she has raised.  Girls always remember your mother's strength....you have that strength too. God is faithful. Love and prayers
The Judd's have always been my favorite. GOD bless this precious family.
So sorry for Wynonna, Ashley, Naomi's  husband Larry  & Their entire family continued prayers for all of them.
hugs and prayers Wynonna & Ashley!
I lived with high functioning non-clinical, situational depression for about 2.5 almost 3 years straight solid, starting in 2012. No break. That junk was. Gut. Wrenching. Being unmedicated was the stupidest thing I could’ve ever done for myself. What my silly butt needed was a doctor. I had some horrible things happen (not abuse or assault) that I just could not reconcile in my heart & mind. Between my mom’s breast cancer diagnosis (she’s good now) & then losing 6 people dear to me in 1.5 yrs, I was just down. My mind & my body were just really traumatized is what was going on. Completely discouraged, scared, overwhelmed by a lot of loss. I didn’t care that God loved me, I didn’t care that “He was with me.” i would sit in church & be completely unmoved by anything. I would refute EVERY single truth in my mind & just immediately resort to “oh that just doesn’t apply to me.” Listening to worship music made it worse bc I would just think of Heaven (not always good for someone’s who’s depressed). I would see guns & be triggered with awful thoughts. I couldn’t recognize myself in the mirror, yea so that was weird lol. I got up every day as soon as I woke up. 8 hours each night. Exercised everyday. Ate healthy.. everyday. I was still miserable & scared. Ruminated on awful fears, I was just really really low & lost. I was a happy kid/teenager/young adult, so everything was new & confusing to me. I cannot imagine what it would be like for me if it was clinical. So my respects are extremely high to the ones who struggle. It does not seem like it is for the faint of heart. My deep love to y’all. 🙏🏻🤍
I really don’t think she is dead or shot herself in the head. Naomi and Ashly are big activist and are part of taking the 2nd away.
The Judds should have been Inducted a long long time ago it sucks it took this darn long
Ashley Judd was an awesome woman. Wynonna was also strong and as beautiful as her Mother. R.I.P. Ashley. Sleep well ❤ ✝ 🙏🏻
Praying for the Judd's everyday 💗🙏🙏
Why did she killed here self she had so much happiness and fame she was so pretty
So sorry but you will get through this.  She'll always be your Mama and no one else's.  God bless all your family - now and always.
I know how they r feeling by Daddy committed Suicide with a firearm due to mental illness
Tears running down my cheeks..a beautiful life and voice and soul, gone too soon..Naomi was the harmony to the soundtrack of my youth, singing with family and friends..may God bless and bring healing peace to Wynonna and Ashley and all those who grieve for this loss
🙏 rip Naomi 🙏  and my deepest  condolences  to the family 👪  and loved ones  much love ❤️  and godspeed 🙏 💔
I wish I was a neighbor I would bring you coffee with Cinnamon and Cardamon and offer you warm huggs of Healing! Love, Love, Love OOOOOOOOOOOOO XXXXXXXXXX
Your Mom is finally at peace now,she suffered for way too long,she was as strong as she could be for her girls,wow,she fought her demons ,good fight till they finally won.She went many rounds,Ali would have been so proud of her.The world is so proud of her.I am armoured by her,my hero.I will continue because just like your Mom,I will not go down without giving it my all.Rest forever in peace.
Always admired her for her grace and poise. She will be remembered forever and truly missed. From one redhead to another. Love to all her family!
She is resting in peace. She’s another Angel up there with our Lord!!! God give you girls Serenity.
Click bait
The strongest was Ashley.  She found her Mom.
Love you guys!!! God be with you and I can see that he is, may God you Bless you in everything you do!!!🙏😇❤️ Most beautiful family!!!
Praying for you Wynonna and Ashley:  Holding you up before the throne of God that His grace and mercy would fill your lives during this difficult time.  Heaven will prevail for Jesus' sake.
Girls The World loves you, and The World loves Naomi
Be strong, I’m sad too😪
I loved the judds  I'm so sorry that Naomi suffered until she felt she had no other choice but to take her own life especially with a firearm  I'm 7 years older than Naomi and also suffer with anxiety and depression but I have not been suicidal. I take meds for these two medical conditions and so far they have worked for me  I am so sad that Naomi's meds and treatments did not work for her and she felt she could no longer go on living  she had so much more to give her musical audiences and her family  the memorial service was beautiful and I appreciate her two beautiful daughters Ashley and wynonna for their beautiful remembrances of her and what she meant to them as a mother  rest in peace Naomi
The Lord bless and keep you safe in his loving arms🙏
God bless her family. Her life was amazing, but I did not know her struggles until I watched the documentary about her and Wynonna's last tour together. I always thought she was so pretty. Now it's hard to believe she kept so much inside when she came out for a performance with her beautiful smile. Prayers for her daughters and her husband......
Each time I looked at and listened to little bits of conversations Naomi would say about struggles w/ mental illness and opening up with her family little by little it’s giving me courage to be open w/ my family I’m so thankful but saddened over the passing of Naomi bless you all 🙏and praying comfort and healing ❤️
My heart is broken. Im so sorry. I loved your mom so much. Sending  all my love.
OMG that’s fantastic! Shall we connect?
Sending comforting prayers to you ladies and all of Naomi’s loved ones and fans.
You can seem to have it all and in some sense be vulnerable.
A beautiful and talented mother and daughter. I loved them. :)  'TRUE LOVE IS EVERYTHING'  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTAmySBtHhk
What a beautiful award for this beautiful family.
We love you all
Love her and love you too.
Prayers for all of the family 💖💖💖
These women are awesome..unlike the kardashians, fake women with no talent. RIP NAOMI.
Prayers for Christine aka Wynona.  I hung out with you Drake High before me Chorus, you band.  Would love to talk with you..
So sad😪to hear this news I have to say Wynonna you and your mom sang like Angels both of you were very gifted and blessed so many  sorry your mom had personal struggles but she's in God's hands now singing in the Angels choir now my prayers are with you and your family ❤️ you all and lean on God he will see you through.stay strong and thanks for sharing your mom's struggles with us to help others with the same struggles knowing that there not alone out there.
Confession: I've enjoyed a couple of their tunes, and bought Wynonna's debut album, but can't call myself a 'fan" - that's disrespectful to The Judds true fan base. My heart is broken for you all.  I pray for Ashley and Wynonna, and the family and friends of Naomi.  No words convey my sorrow for you and your families.
I just lost my mother-in-law, 95 years old, to a broken hip accident. I'm so sorry for your loss. My own mother died at 67 yrs of age due to a heart ailment. It's so hard to lose our mammas especially when they are also our best friends.
RIP Naomi god bless the Judd family
What a tragic loss. My heart goes out to her family. RIP Naomi
My dad committed suicide when I was in grade school school.The shame that was attached to that my whole life altered the course of my life on so many levels.  I was  embarrassed and felt like there was this awful “thing” that had happened.  I didn’t understand until just over the last couple years that this is a disease and there’s nothing to be ashamed about.  It’s liberating to see strong people stand up and talk about this in such an open, honest and non judgemental way. I wish the world was this open when I was growing up and dealing with the suicide of a parent. Holding it inside positively isn’t healthy.  Take it from me.
👍 🙏
It's just so heartbreaking I mean Canada they're going to start killing depressed people and call it euthanasia for hopeless permanent solution 💔   Even homeless r at kill risk rather than get homeless people a place Canada's going to be euthanizing them
I am so sorry for your loss! Words cannot express my thoughts and feelings right now. Know I am standing with you all now and always! Love and prayers go out to her family, and loved ones. She will never be forgotten!!! RIP!!!!❤️🙏
Every suicide is horrible to any family. Depression will always win at the end. Is living with a monster inside your thoughts 24/7. You just can’t beat it.
No-one knows a persons struggles. Outwardly she seemed to have it all. I pray she is now in the arms of the Lord and at peace. Loved the Judds music and still do. RIP Naomi.
I took my mom to the judds final concert in Murfreesboro Tennessee.  I have lost my mom since. My heart hurts for both Ashley and Wynonna, I still miss my momma 💔. I'm so sorry for your loss. God bless you all.
When Jesus lives in yr heart. U hv hope when yr love ones die. They know their mom is in Heaven. And one day they will see her again..love this Family
WHY WHY WHY are we celebrating a woman who took the only life God ever gave her and now is in hell for all eternity??? WHY? It's the most selfish coward act you can do to yourself and it is being celebrated?? Also, please let the women out there who are thinking about plastic surgery and then show them a photo of ashley judd's and Priscilla Presley's faces. Maybe if one woman can be saved from looking like hot garbage after plastic surgery.
I'm so sorry  for the loss of Naomi  my heart goes out to the judd family.  I pray the lord sends the comforting spirit.. God bess
So real and raw. I truly pray that Naomi is at peace.
I truly don't believe she killed herself.
Wynonna, Thank you for the Music, and loving us!  God Bless you both, you are in our prayers.
I’m still praying for each of you! Larry, God Bless You! Girl’s, God Bless You and your families. JESUS LOVES U AND SO DO I💔👑🙏🙌💔
I'm hoping you 2 Ladies are doing well, I'm not sure if how to talk about this ,I do know and I can tell you that My Mom past away from what they called a heartattack ,But I can tell you she was as depressed as any one could have every been and I could help her ,cause I was to ,My brother had at 37 passed a way on mother's day 1992,we lost Mom 6 weeks later ! I  hadn't even started to breath normal from my bro passing and Mom passed! Depression is a killer ,Mom lived with it ALL HER LIFE,while I finally realized it My sister's and others ,well if they knew it they never spoke it ! So Now it ,2022 ! She would be 86 ,bro would be 67,I think of them everyday  ! Your Mama,was as wonderful as they come but you knew that ! God Bless Her ,And God Bless You Both  ,Stay Strong ,You all are still NEEDED !
The husband must be suffering so much with her loss.
Such incredibly strong and graceful women -- Wynonna and Ashley. God bless them all.
His Bless these strong beautiful women and her husband
My family has also been riddled with mental illness of all kinds.  My mother was in and out of hospitals with “nervous breakdowns” ( the only diagnosis back then). I feel your pain in my soul. I am so sorry for your loss.  It helped me that my mother and I had made peace just weeks before her death.  I am grateful for that closure. God spoke to me shortly after her death and told me I needed to forgive her.  She did the best she could.  It was like a huge boulder had been lifted off of my shoulders.  We are only human. Your momma did the best she could.  She was kind to others, because she knew what it was like to be treated unkindly.  My heart grieves with you.  You are her legacy. She loves you both still.  You are all in my prayers.
We sure love y’all ♥️
My heart breaks for you ladies, my mom is on hospice and and I am completely heartbroken
Rest In Peace Sweet angel! I’m praying for your girls! 💔🙏🏻
I love the Judds ..I love their music and I love Ashley’s movies . My heart aches for all of the family . RIP Naomi  ❤️
Do not cry because it is over, smile because it happened
Suicide. My big brother as well as my most beloved only child. It’s devastating because life is so very precious. In fact the devastation of it leaves one so shocked and bereft that the preciousness of it is the only thing that keeps one from it themselves when it’s been so very close to you so many times, may God bless and keep this family. Naomi Judd still after all of these years remains one of the most beautiful women I’ve ever seen.
I love the judds
Wynonna & Ashley, Naomi is a   Superstar and will always be 1. Thank You for sharing her with us. I am praying for you girls... The World loves you both and are hurting with you... 💜
Ashley & Wynonna WE LOVE YOU!!! 💜💜💜💜
So sorry for lost but y’all will always be mine and my daughter’s rock so many things in common you know all we have is each other!!! Us two so y’all are the rock in our life we love and thanking of you all!!
So sorry to hear about your mother’s passing Wynona and Ashley. Your mother was beautiful and so talented. Prayers are with you and the family!
Naomi I know you’re pain 💔 Rest In Peace ✝️
Hey I get it I'm 70 really what's left in the world's sick and crazy what's left
I am so sorry for your loss. Your mom is  at peace no She will be always be remembered.
My son loved her so much God bless both of you
I seen the Judy's in concert in 1983,what a Great concert. Naomi  had a beautiful dress on. The Judy's was such Great  team.  Classy all the way. Wynonna &Ashley & her husband Larry Strickland, my heart &  prayers  go out to you ALL. MY FIND PEACE knowing she's  not in pain anymore .she will be miss forever. truely Sandra
I lost my mom when I was 17 without warning...so I understand that feeling. But, you were very blessed by the time with a beautiful soul.God bless you...🙏
Wy is still beautiful. I always thought she looked like a female Elvis.
You know when it comes down to it what choice do we have. We have to get up and keep going no matter how hard it is. We have to go on for those that are still here even when we don't feel like it. It isn't easy I know this first hand, but God is our strength an ever present help in the time of trouble. Amen
I love the Judds and remember singing some of their songs. So sad about Naomi and everything she went through, especially as she was a child being abused by a family member . RIP 😢
I experienced severe anxiety when I was 20 years of age. I learned the manifestations of emotional release and learned it's a journey to daily conquer the restimulation or triggers reflective of my core issue resulting in constant anxiety. I learned to connect with the underlying feelings and repetitively discharge them dynamically with discipline. Verbalizing is significant but, but it is the beginning of the journey. It's learning to repetitively connect with and surrender the underlying feelings repetitively by learning and practicing the manifestations of emotional discharge that one conquers depression and anxiety. I learned and practice the disciplines daily to succeed at functioning effectively in life.  I extend my sincere condolences to the Judd family.  I can fully empathize with the past deep-seated pain of Naomi and now the grief of her family. Truly, sincerely, bless the soul of Naomi. Rest in Peace.
Offer kind words and love to people who express their sadness or pains be it online on the internet, in person or anywhere else!!! Let love speak and save a person suffering from mental illness..BREAK THE STIGMA AND LOVE ONE ANOTHER!!!! Save lives and be the disciplines of goodness and love folks!!!!
Thankfully nobody on here attacked this family’s grief and loss and faith!!!! Condolences to the Judd’s and to all those who suffered from mental illness. YOU ARE NOT ALONE AND GOD ALWAYS HEARS YOUR SUFFERINGS AND PAINS. Offer it to Him, He listens and He is a merciful God. He will restore your soul!!!! Let no man take away your peace and let no man destroy what He has built. You are God’s child. Love dwells in your heart. Enough with stigmas with mental illness and enough with bullying!!!! Love one another in God’s light and peace.
Dear Wynonna and Ashley I am so terribly sad for you guys.  Also, sad for Larry.  What a huge loss this is.  She loved her family so much and she just always seemed so real and honest about her struggles.  She will always be missed and will continue to pray for you girls and Larry and all of your family. May Naomi Rest In Peace forever.  She was so loved and adored by so many people. ♥️🙏🏻
Wynonna and Ashley,  I'm so sorry for your loss. Depression is something I know well.
I am sorry about your mom she is still in your harts love you
May the Lord Bless Wynonna & Ashley, Pops, Naomi, and all of y’all family & friends I pray Naomi is able to Rest In Peace! All of your family has given us (your fans) so much joy, over so many years. My heart breaks for all of you. I lost my parents and have never known more pain, so I empathize with y’all so very much. I also have suffered the loss of my favorite uncle to mental illness… there are no words at this time that will help in any way, just know the world is praying for you.
This is very sad that this happened to her but when people have a bad illness of depression you are not to have a firearm when you go to fill out paperwork,,tells you that so I don't understand why was there a firearm in the house ,,,when she was that bad with depression ,,,why didn't she have somebody watch her like around-the-clock a nurse,,a nurse to stay with her and talk to her while they go do the family plans on the road,,, I deal with depression for over 30 years and I take medication,,,I even had a son 17 years old that was murdered a sister 19 years old murder her baby 18 months old murder my father's 60 years old murder all four I struggle with that,, my husband died last year with cancer,,he was in law enforcement 47 years,x he was a lot older than me,,but we love each other,,, but I struggle with that too,,but I'm not going to take my life,, I don't want to go to hell,,and I'm not putting her down because I like their music and I've always listen to them,,I'm 53 years old going on 54 and I have all the CDs and I like that song Tell me about the good old days Grandpa,,, I feel sorry for Larry and  the daughters,,but we are poor people too going through a lot,, and there's days I think how am I going to make it to live off what money he left me to live off of,, and yes they were poor  people too,but they have money and can get good doctor's,, they became rich then they wasted their money the daughter did because the mother was jumping on her about it and arguing with her about spending lots of money,,then the Granddaughter ends up in prison for drugs in 2018 she got charged she got eight years in prison,, it's sad,, it was on the news about her Granddaughter  didn't even get to see the Grandmother,,,,I LOVE SEEING THEM BOTH SINGING TOGETHER,,THEY WAS A GREAT TEAM,,,MISS THEM,,WISH I COULD HAVE MET HER,,BUT I LIVE IN WINCHESTER VIRGINIA,,AND THEY NEVER DOWN THIS WAY,,,I EVEN TEXT ONE TIME TO THEM FOR MY SISTER BIRTHDAY PARTY BEFORE SHE GOT MURDER,AND THEY NEVER RESPOND BACK,,THERE FOR I FEEL LIKE THEY DIDN'T CARE,,,IF IT WAS NOT FOR EVERYBODY BUYING THERE DVD AND SHIRTS AND OTHER THINGS THEY HAVE,,WE THE PEOPLE IS WHAT KEEPS THEM GOING WHEN WE SPEND OUR MONEY,, BUT A LOT  LIKE OF PEOPLE LOOK OVER YOU LIKE YOUR NOTHING,,, GOD BE WITH THE FAMILY, AND WATCH OVER THEM,,,,
May GOD Bless the Family and Friends in their time of great grief and great loss as only HE can..!!
The most impressive thing about Naomi was that she admitted her flaws and mistakes and worked on changing them. She made her children a priority. I hope she is at peace!
Prayers to both of these two strong ladies!
🙏💐love and prayers for Naomi's beautiful daughters and family.
When I heard of Naomi's death, it floored me & has had a profound affect on me & still does. I cry every time I hear her name, maybe because I have those thoughts at times, but I'm taking care of my grandkids & I can't leave them. The Judd's were a part of my life ever since ' Why Not Me'. I'm sending my condolences & love to the Judd's family. I love you & I pray for your strength in this overwhelmingly sad time. Lean on God, He's got you. Love always, Lynn Frazier.
Wynonna , Ashley, & Pops: You all  have always lit the stage up, on whatever stage you stood on!  I know with your grieving now, it’s hard to think about your Mom’s/ WIfe’s Soul’s Presence; but her Soul’s aliveness is with you right now, and if you can learn to TAP INTO this Soul Energy of your Wife’s/Mom’s....you’ll know that all of her ISN’T gone, (like Jesus said, when the Flesh dies, the Soul lives on Forever)! If you can TAP INTO your Mom’s Soul Energy, you will FEEL her presence in the room where you stand, & at times later on (days, weeks, years), she will comeback to visit you when you least expect it—(but you will know, because you will FEEL her presence).  I know this, because my Mom died in 2016, and my Mom’s Soul has visited me many times! God Bless All Of You Forever!  People grieve in different ways—& sometimes they can’t take the pain either....(so grieve together—& keep an eye on each other), to make it through this pain!
RIP Naomi. You are loved and will be missed ❤️ condolences to Wynonna and Ashley 😢
Bless you all🙏So very sorry for your loss🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Naomi you are finally at peace now.  You are with the Lord.  No more pain or suffering.  Just peace and happiness. 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
You girls were so strong and Iam so so sorry for your loss 🙏 Sending hugs and Peace your way ❤️ And congratulations for everything you The Judges accomplish together  Amazing voices &  performances love you girls 🌷🌷🌷
So very sorry ladies. 🙏❤️
Amazing how Naomi just simply had a mental breakdown and killed herself at the thought of standing beside Wyonna for a lifetime award. Yeah she was sick alright.  Naomi’s greatest demon she battled was her fear that people couldn’t and wouldn’t love her and she chose to fulfill that prophecy with success in my book because I hope her selfish grand finale against Wyonna keeps her rolling in her grave.
My heart is broken into a million pieces.... I pray Lord Jesus Took her with Him. Amen. 😌😌🙌🙌💕🌹🌹
Ladies my heart ♥️ goes out to you. Peace & Grace
My heart goes out to you; met you when you were here in Idaho Falls, ID last fall - I worked at the theater! Your faith was palpable and know that God is comforting you through this difficult time - however, we are human and we will grieve! Thinking of you and yours! A huge loss for you; tough to deal with the loss of your parent - no matter the circumstances!
I am praying for you dear ladies. God Bless you with His Strength and His Love.
God bless her family..and God rest her soul!🙇‍♀️❤
Your mom's leaving saved me from taking mine. I lost my oldest sister.inez,then my husband, my sister from a car accident,my husband from 2 horrible strokes and dementia. I lost 2 daughter's not to illness, we will never know. The pain from that.is overwhelmed me. I lost on of our furbabies due to cancer. They are litter mates. All that is left is a daughter dawn who is in the navy. Her dad was a liter in-between Marines and army reserves.i have so many bad days but it's just mamajama and my self. I will send you all my hugs and prayers. You will always feel her in your mind and heart.just cherish the day when you can see her as a rainbow. Love to all.
Love you both!  Very heartbreaking!  Please reach out to Piper for love and support.  She loves you both!
Love your whole family.  God give you comfort & strength.
God bless you all
Love them. What more is there to say?
My condolences on the passing of your mom.  She seemed to make the best of her time on the journey until she felt moved to start another a bit sooner than expected.  RIP
Very sad that Naomi Judd has passed away due to mental health issues. I saw her and Wynonna in concert years ago. They were terrific. My sincere condolences to the Judd family.
Winona, Ashely, you all had a beautiful momma who loved, loved you!  Thank God for that, now heaven gets your Momma and she is free from this tragic world. Soon dear ones, we will all be together, with Him! Soon! Find strength from Him in this time, He is close to the broken hearted, very close. It’s really all about Jesus, let His love fill you and heal you. GO to Him.
Her Brother Mark Judd used to be the Pastor of My Familys Church in Colesburg Kentucky
JS  Foster, is judgemental& cold. I, know the BIBLE fairly well&  the final decision as to NAOMI*S  place belongs to Our HEV. FATH. I, hope you repent for your sinful Judgemental I'm& you are not a nice person(when).  The girls are suffering so badly!!!!!!
I, loved the JUDDS.... Hope  NAOMI; is. at peace. Such, strong admirable three girls. I, wish them my heart- felt prayers!!!!!
Oh …God Bless 💜🙏🏻💜
God bless the judd family .
Naomi raised two beautiful strong women. Be proud Naomi RIP💝
I love you ladies. ❤️
Wynonna and Ashley, Just remember heaven must have needed an angel and we all know he has only the best. RIP Naomi, RIP
Sending my deepest sympathies, peace, love and Infinite Blessings ❤🙏✨
Love them all ❤️❤️❤️ rest in peace beautiful Naomi
Touched lives with there music sad, the mother felt that was the only way to have peace.   Christ is here in this life for all, He does answer his children and gives his peace and joy . Sin  an evil is running rampant every where!  Seek out the Great comforter... Christ Jesus! Dont give up!  Ever!Keep Moving! Pressing Forward ..  Only through Christ can anyone be Saved and have His true peace..  All else is sinking ground. Prayers of peace for her daughters and family😔☝🙏
If they loved her so much, why did a chronically suicidal individual have access to a gun?
Naomi had ECT. There is an increased risk for suicide after ECT. See site ectjustice and learn about the lawsuits taking place around this practice in the US and England. No FDA testing of  devices used or procedure for safety or even effectiveness.  Long term risks can include CTE and ALS. Every procedure based on trauma medicine is an acquired traumatic brain injury at minimum.
my thoughts and prayers are with you and your family
so very sorry for the loss my prayers and condolences are with you wynonna and ashley God bless you both
It's sad,, why did you do this to her daughter's her daughter were so close depression is a very bad thing but I didn't know it could take you that far and killing yourself I haven't very bad but I am not going to take my life I will always like her they both are great singers I know people are talking about her taking her life and she won't go to heaven because of it but we don't know what she's going though, I feel sorry for the family especially the husband to spent day and night with her throughout their life she will be sadly missed by everyone but even the rich people and famous people are just like us human beings please God open the gates and let her into heaven
My heart is broken for the family. The loss of this extraordinary woman is heartbreaking. God bless her daughters and family.
Stupid is as stupid does. Quit idolizing idiots.
good
Was her death unexpected?
Naomi Judd was and is America's Mom, we 'Adopted Her by Heart.'. She had love that embraced the world.  Wynonna and Ashley shared their mother with everyone.  Larry Strickland shared his wife with the world.  When my two youngest children were small, we watched the Judd's.  Bought them each a 🎸, they sang, danced, and rocked with the Judd's.  Beautiful Memories,  Thank you 😘😘😘
Who is Uncle Mark?
Truly sorry for your loss, I know how you feel I just lost my Mother, end of January
So sorry for your loss.
Wynonna and Ashley Judd you can contact me any time.im here for both of you.
Love Love Love These Ladies! So Sorry for Ashley and Wynonna.  She gave us all soooooooooo Much.  Thank You for the Music.
Never heard her music (I only listen to classical), but seems that she was a nice person and was liked by many.  Very sad.  I battle depression and contemplated ending it all.  Watching her daughters’ grief, I know I will never end my life, so my son would not have to go through such an ordeal.  Surprised how many negative (even judgmental religious) comments are posted.  People - family lost their Mom.  If you have nothing nice to say, then just don’t say anything.
I'm sorry naomi killed herself it's sad but I think she was selfish doing something like this regardless, leaving her daughter's in turmoil, there's always someone out there worse off, think of all the little children fighting for there lives with cancer, in st.judes, and she does this
I am heartbroken for this loss and I hope your family can find comfort and strength in the memories that remain!
That Wynonnas a firecracker ❤
My Heart goes out to both of you prayers for you
I know your hearts are so broken . I am not eloquent enough to tell you how much I hurt for you. My father unfortunately died by suicide December 20 1955 . I was having my 2nd birthday on the 31st . I had 3 older brothers . Country music just IS family . I love ya’ll , and you will be in my prayers from this moment on 💜
Very sorry for your loss. I hope they give you privacy in your time for her.
💖💖💖
Don’t know much about this family just that 2 were singers, Ashley an actress, a pretty good one too…but tuned them out after hearing and seeing what Ashley became…what an embarrassment - so sad !
Love you Strong Ladies <3 <3
So sorry to learn of your loss. I loved loved Naomi & admired her so much! At first vI thought Naomi & Wy. we're sisters! I was so sad to learn she had to step out from traveling - allow Wy to carry on.  😭😭😭🙏
Wynonna,  I'd love to be your friend
Something seems to be off here! They make it sound like Naomi just went to her bedroom, Took some pills, and decided to kill herself?? Something doesn’t feel right
For Naomi:   + O Jesus, eternal Truth, our Life, I call upon You and I beg Your mercy for poor sinners. O sweetest Heart of my Lord, full of pity and unfathomable mercy, I plead with You for poor sinners. O Most Sacred Heart, Fount of Mercy from which gush forth rays of inconceivable graces upon the entire human race, I beg of You light for poor sinners. O Jesus, be mindful of Your own bitter Passion and do not permit the loss of souls redeemed at so dear a price of Your most precious Blood. O Jesus, when I consider the great price of Your Blood, I rejoice at its immensity, for one drop alone would have been enough for the salvation of all sinners. Although sin is an abyss of wickedness and ingratitude, the price paid for us can never be equalled. Therefore, let every soul trust in the Passion of the Lord, and place its hope in His mercy. God will not deny His mercy to anyone. Heaven and earth may change, but God's mercy will never be exhausted. Oh, what immense joy burns in my heart when I contemplate Your incomprehensible goodness, O Jesus! I desire to bring all sinners to Your feet that they may glorify Your mercy throughout endless ages, Amen + You expired, Jesus, but the source of life gushed forth for souls, and the ocean of mercy opened up for the whole world. O Fount of Life, unfathomable Divine Mercy, envelop the whole world and empty Yourself out upon us. + O Blood and Water, which gushed forth from the Heart of Jesus as a fount of mercy for us, I trust in You!  + O Blood and Water, which gushed forth from the Heart of Jesus as a fount of mercy for us, I trust in You!  + O Blood and Water, which gushed forth from the Heart of Jesus as a fount of mercy for us, I trust in You! Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, Amen. + Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death, Amen. + I believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried; He descended into hell; on the third day He rose again from the dead; He ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty; from there He will come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen. +  For the sake of His sorrowful Passion, have mercy on us and on the whole world. + For the sake of His sorrowful Passion, have mercy on us and on the whole world. + For the sake of His sorrowful Passion, have mercy on us and on the whole world. + For the sake of His sorrowful Passion, have mercy on us and on the whole world. + For the sake of His sorrowful Passion, have mercy on us and on the whole world. + For the sake of His sorrowful Passion, have mercy on us and on the whole world. + For the sake of His sorrowful Passion, have mercy on us and on the whole world. + For the sake of His sorrowful Passion, have mercy on us and on the whole world. + For the sake of His sorrowful Passion, have mercy on us and on the whole world. + For the sake of His sorrowful Passion, have mercy on us and on the whole world. +  Holy God, Holy Mighty One, Holy Immortal One, have mercy on us and on the whole world.+ Holy God, Holy Mighty One, Holy Immortal One, have mercy on us and on the whole world.+ Holy God, Holy Mighty One, Holy Immortal One, have mercy on us and on the whole world.+ Amen.
God bless you Wynona and Ashley.  Your beautiful witness is so powerful. Your precious mother is in Jesus' loving arms. Thank you for sharing your testimony with us.  God bless you dear Naomi. Rest in joyful peace.    <3   <3   <3
My heart  breaks that she lost her battle with depression.  May she REST IN PEACE 💔🤲🕊🙏❤
Her husband Larry seems like a superb, stand up man, the calm water amongst a storm.
WTF HAPPENED TO ASHLEY’s FACE
Saw them in concert when they first started touring....in VA.  They were the opening act for BJ Thomas.......great show....
Adrenachrome?
I have been a fan of the Judds as Country Music most wonderful female Duo. Then after I watched Wynonna take over on her Solo career. I mean I've read your books. I think you are the best thing that ever happen to country music. My heart is broken along with so many of you fan's. Fly hi Naomi may you find the peace in heaven that you just cldnt find here. Wynonna and Ashley as someone who's mother has passed. Time give yourself time to mourn her passing. Because it's only in time will you have any peace with this.
No words could describe the journey that Naomi had from youth , into young adulthood , with one child, then, second child and no help from the fathers! Then, to obtain her RN degree , while working multiple  jobs, on welfare etc shows her live, strength and determination to survive, with her children! Not to mention the third abusive man ‼️ God was with her and rewarded her on earth and now , in heaven 💜☦️ Girls know your mom gave you her best ❣️ You will realize, as life goes on, on earth , without her , that the things you did not understand during your mother daughter relationships  on earth , will reveal to you over time, that she had yiur best interest, as she trued to guide you, even tho you may not have agreed, at the time 😉 She is ine beautiful lady ❤️ It breaks my heart that she had the endure such emotional pain  ‼️😰 Oh, how I wish she could have lived to be 100😰I am so very sorry , for your lost 🙏💜🙋‍♀️ I had a simular journey as your mom, as a single  parent,  getting my RN and trying  to survive as a single parent! Then, marriage #2, 2nd new baby and learned he was a facade ‼️ i have struggled from age 18 to current, worrying about my children’s well being 🙏🙋‍♀️ and being physically disabled since age 50, from stress regarding my two children and the failure of their fathers, to provide , when both were college educated , middle upper class !!!   I was working as an RN, when emotional and financial abuse caused so much stress that it caused inflammation in my body ‼️ The wrong man can ruin your lives ‼️ Praise God, he allowed your mom to be financially successful and overcome and you girls❣️Praises to Jesus ☦️💜
Rip ...will be sadly missed and always live on through her music and true fans..forever loved....
Keep singis angels the
Rest In Peace sweet Naomi!
Bless their hearts 🥰
We all lost a beautiful woman last week.  People who have never had to deal with mental illness will never understand that pain.  My thoughts and prayers are with that family and all country music fans.  There will never be another one like Naomi.
Amazing vocalists for country music, will truly miss that part of the mother in Naomi Judd that started this family off on a musical career. Resting In God eternally thank you Naomi for the songs and sharing your family in music for all to love and cherish for a life time.
I'm sorry for their loss.
Psalms 23 I love this and #WynonnaJudd you did a phenomenal job reading it under the circumstances. #AshleyJudd you too did a phenomenal job speaking of your mother. #NaomiJudd you will forever be in our hearts. Heavenly Father, I pray You comfort Wynonna and Ashley during this difficult and challenging time. I pray, You cover them in the Precious Blood of Jesus as they endure the days ahead from the loss of their beautiful and talented mother. Please give them the strength they so desperately need in the days ahead of them. Comfort and Bless them from the Crown of their Heads, to the Soles of their Feet! In the Mighty Name of Jesus we Pray!🙏 Amen! ✝️❤️🌟🕊🦋
R.I.p Naomi jud
Ms Judd had the procedure ECT or electroshock. Learn about this at site ectjustice and articles on Mad in America. Videos on YouTube under  ds electroshock. Lawsuits taking place in the US and England around this procedure.
Oh my goodness! 🙁
I will miss your mom. I know it's hard to lose your mom. I lost mine December 14,2021.
Enjoyed the music for many years.  My prayers and condolences for family
Just 😔. Naomi raised strong girls and I wish them health and healing.Wynona,sing!!!🥰
Mom young my mom 77yearsold miss her momday
Suffering from Depression since 2019 and finally getting out of the black abyss in 2022, I feel so bad for Naomi Judd. I know the feeling of wanting to end your life in order to stop the pain you are feeling. You keep fighting this feeling, not wanting to leave your loved ones, but at some point, you stop caring and just feel this terrible emptiness inside.Naomi fought her battle valiantly, but there's something within you that finally gives in to the Demon Depression.  Antidepressants really do not help many people. They helped me initially, but then I suffered side effects and had to stop them. I was told I would have to keep "trying out" antidepressants in order to find one that worked for me. I wasn't willing to be a guinea pig for these psychiatrists. I wonder how many antidepressants Naomi tried? Probably she experienced side effects or found out that they weren't helpful.   Nowadays, psychiatrists don't really want to talk much with patient--they just want give you meds and send you on your way. Instead you are expected to find a therapist to talk things out. It's a terrible system--Naomi is proof how the current mental illness system is broken and ineffectual.  RIP, singing angel. You will be missed.
I suffer from bipolar and have tried to commit sucked several times I don’t know why God didn’t let me die but I’m happy now to be alive , I’m closer to my family now than I’ve been in years , I now deal with Parkinson’s but it’s easy after going through years of depression, unless you’ve had it , it’s hard to describe how disability it is . I love my kids saying I love you every time we talk now and my grandson is such a blessing to me he’s 23 now but he’s close to me . If your family has bipolar I it please don’t tell them you an handle it , it’s not that easy just listen to them and hug them and let them know you try to understand even if you don’t
I couldn’t help but say the Lord is my Shepard with you, I am sorry to hear about your mom I hope that she has found peace on the other side  ✝️🌼🌸🕊🕯
I saw Wynonna in concert one week before she lost her mother. No one saw this coming! 😭
My condolences to the family
Poor Wy. Her momma left this world overshadowing yet another accomplishment of her daughter. It really does sicken me how she treated Wynonna. We are so proud of you, Wy! Congratulations
sending lots of love hugs and prayers to all who knew your mom!!
My boyfriend got me a signed book from Naomi,I love it and now I’m gonna miss both of them. I lost my Billy to cancer Aug 2021. After 29 years and 2 kids. He was My best friend and confidant. Prayers go out to you girls I pray y’all can get back up and fight the good fight to survive this crazy world. 🌸💛🌺😭RIP NAOMI I will never forget you.
My husband was her favorite fan
I wish peace for her daughters. I know the pain and agony of losing your Mother. You have my prayers and thanks for the wonderful music y’all have blessed us with. May Jesus be with you and comfort you in your sorrow.
R.I.P Mama Judd. U have no idea how much u will be missed.
Suicide is and will always be wrong. Jesus said “come to me all I’ll give you rest…”
I just hope she git the love as we do, feel unrequited love, unconditional love. As a human, as a wife as a friend, family member and as a MOTHER. I personally  celebrate her freedom from any tipe of pain. Thank you for your voice, your truth, as you were forced to endure family, exposed scrutiny, physical illness and the now exposed mental distress.
My Deepest Condolences to Wynonna and Ashley💔😥🙏 There are no words...Praying the Holy Spirit Comforts your hearts as only he can🙏 Your Mother was a Beautiful spirit who was loved by so many!🌹❤ Will be holding you up in Prayer🙏
"To live in the hearts we love is never to die"... That's what my dad's headstone reads... he passed in 1979.i keep him alive through me and cherish all that I got from him in my being..my condolences to your family...I grew up with wynonna ,I am 54 I been to numerous judd concerts and a few wynonna concerts and I listen to the big noise too you are awesome I love your realism..thanks for all your music it has been my therapy.. Cathy Sue sexton sending prayers
The 23rd Psalm or as it's also known: the Shepherd's Prayer. Rest easy now, Naomi, and may God watch over you & your girls🙏
Did I miss the description of Naomi's final hours?
They should have stayed home.  Wy is not making it big like the Judds.  This was disrespectful to Naomi and looked like a photo op for Wy.  I'm also disappointed in Skaggs and CMA. I don't listen to country anymore. The newbies are ruining it anyway.
My condolences to the family.🙏🏼 I grew up listening to The Judd's music and videos. My heart is broken💔
Love you your own song I can only imagine, you need to watch, and reamber, love you Lost my daughter Nicole and Mom, you were Loved, helped me so so much,you are loved God bless you, my mom's and daughter are singing with your mommy around the throne, totally healed 💔➕❤️🙏

Ugly crying rn 😭
So sad!
My heart breaks 💔💔for you all. I loved The Judd's & I love Wynonna and I love Ashley. She's a great actress. Your mom will be missed.  R.I.P Naomi 😭😭💔💔 Prayers for your family. God Bless you all
Sending healing prayers to both of you Wynona & Ashley. RIP sweet Naomi.
I hope this family peace and prayers are with you and your family loved the judds.god bless you all.
To The Judd Family, Look up, get up , & never give up! 🙏🏼
What a beautiful and forceful testimony of their faith in God, for He is carrrying Wynonna and Ashley as they remember their beautiful mother, who clearly raised these girls in church. I’m so sorry for their loss. Ten years without my mother, and I certainly have the utmost respect for the Judd family. The Matriarch certainly taught her girls what is most important in life. Faith and Hope. God bless you both.
It's like Naomi was saying, nope, you took too long to induct us so im gonna opt-out of it.....but she opted out of life ....ppl, bless their hearts, make their choices. ....maybe she's found the peace she was looking for 💙
I am so sorry for your loss I have always loved the Judds, I was in high school when I fell in love with your music and the dynamic relationship between you and your mom. Love and prayers for your family.
suicide    so sad   RIP Naomi
Wow glory to God on
😭😭😭Rest In Peace!
My prayers are with with the Judd family Naomi Judd was one of the best Women I have ever known.
We love you sisters and your mother too. Loved your music and movies too that you shared with us. May God give you the strength to find peace and please think of the good times you had with her always. God bless you!
So very sorry for your loss 💕 your beautiful mom is always with you both in spirit 🙏❤️💕
My heartfelt condolences for your great loss.
So sad.
She died at home, right?
So sorry for your loss. She was a beautiful person. I understand depression and it is so hard
Wynonna! I smell something coming out from under your skirt little girl! What's really going on?!?! God have mercy on your narcissistic soul! Everything done in the dark, will be brought into the light!
I'm so sorry for your loss. I'm praying for yall.
My condolences go out to  Wynonna and Ashley and I still love to listen  to their songs
Love you Judds🙏🌷
Some disgusting arminian pentecostals have been using her death as a warning for those down here in Tn that if you kill yourself your going straight to hell like Naomi Judd. I'm so sick of the hold that cult has here and people believe that trash no wonder they are walking away in droves. No mercy no grace just uncouth judgmentalism. God rest your soul Naomi
What a load of shite Lord’s Prayer
My heart hurts for both you girls. I too have suffered from mental illness. Your mom was so blessed to have your support and you both by her side. My God grant you peace and know that our precious Jesus holds your right hand ALWAYS.
God bless Naomi for being such a stunning and blessed lady. She will be greatly missed. So much joy to so many people. Rip
Words are never enough.  They say songs can move a generation or mountains.  You and your mom have done both. God speed.
23 Psalm!  Yes!!!!
23rd
Girls your Mama is in Heaven now.  She's all happy and healthy in Heaven!  Praise Jesus; our Lord and Savior!
Happy heavenly mother's day Naomi Judd💐RIP 🙏 😢 ❤ 😔
Rest Easy , Ms Naomi 🕊🕊🕊🤍🤍🤍
She's a beautiful soul
God bless Wynonna and Ashley.  Rest In Peace Naomi🙏
Sending prayers and sympathy to the Judd gals and there families.
I feel for the family. I think she was selfish.
Sending love hugs and prayers 💞
Amazing ladies, bless them all. ❤️
My heart goes out to you on this sad   1st Mother"s Day without your Mother. I have been crying for days with you and your sister. and your stepfather.  May you each find comfort in God,'s Love. Hugs.
They know their momma is just fine and that she's still with them and always will be.  She's free of all the struggles that goes with the earthly body.
My condolences to Wynonna and Ashley and the family. We grieve with you.
my heart hurts for you both.. Know that you will be in my prayers
Just the fact that this couldnt wait tells you all about this society horrible fame can wait no repsect what good does this award do what good
.9
9..9
Uncle Mark??  I  hope her husband  was home but it must have been so traumatic  for him if he was.
God Bless you!  Hold onto those good memories! Move forward She will always be in your heart.
Wynonna recited my very favourite passage. RIP beautiful Naomi.
So sorry for your loss. She was a beautiful woman
I LOVED LOVED The Judds RIP Naomi Prayers Wynonna
I watched her last interview, and I noticed the light in her eyes was gone.  She was not Naomi anymore.  Her essence was gone.  We are cut from the same cloth, Naomi.  God and Jesus please take you into their arms.  I love you.
We love you guys!
I loved the Judds. I love the Judss. I will continue to love the Judds
What did she say? Don’t touch me??
Sending prayers of love and strength for the Judd sisters and Pop....Love from Maryland USA
I am so very sorry for your loss. Praying for peace and healing. 💔
What happened to Ashley Judds face??
I get it but have lots of Love 💕☝️ RIP Naomi 🥰
Wow.. I adore such strong faith. Bless the Judds
My heart aches for you girls and the family. I will have tears for you all when I sing your music!
Sorry for their loss.
I think the girls knew mama s pain!  Though they probably didn’t expect this! I’m so sorry for your loss.
What the hell has happened to Ashley?
So sad I don’t get why we have to die. So fucking sad and scary.  🥺😭
Love this family. The strongest women I have ever seen. God bless you all
Both Sisters are made of the same good solid stuff their Mothers genes passed on to them. They are proud, smart, and strong. They are examples of what all young Women should be made of. No doubt that Naomi was shining high with the Lord as she shared her rightful place between them in the undying love they will all share together forever.  Rest in Peace Naomi, I know as a Christian that the Spirit never dies. 💕
No where did they tell of her final hours
The last thing they did was "uncle marks". ? What at Uncle Mark's?
Lot of people here confused. I'm sure God appreciated pro-abortion self-avowed Nasty Woman's "prayer." Who WAS she really addressing? "Star worshipping" is idol worship.
So she didn't really discuss final hours but giving psalms 23. Was she lucid?
We have been praying for The Judd Family "That peace & comfort will be with them all in the days to come." We lost a dear Loved one from Mental Illness & it is one of the hardest grief stricken things one can ever encounter. Mental illness is just that an illness, like cancer, covid, Multiple, Sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease etc....An illness that one day we pray along with ALL other diseases a cure for. "God Bless You her "BEAUTIFIL" Daughter's."
She will always be loved and never forgotten RIP❤
Heartbreaking 😪😥🙏🙏🙏
Wynona , my heart goes out to you and all your family, The Judd's is my all time favorite band of all time, then Patsy cline, you and your mom made me who I have become today by your music, my family always had my sister and I sing karaoke and all your songs, I love you  my heart goes out to you.
My sincere Heartfelt Condolences to Wynona, Ashley, Larry and families. Your Mother, Naomi will  Always and Forever in Our Hearts💝🙏🙏🙏💝💖
My heart is sad. Amazing ladies. She will be missed.
To Wynona and Ashley, This will be the 8th Mother's Day without my beautiful Mom. The profound loss is still the same. She was my best friend, my person. A huge part of myself left with her.  My heart will forever be broken, until we are together once again.  Know that beautiful  Naomi will be be all around both of you. In a starry night sky, in a warm summer breeze, within your very soul. Always cherish each other. You'll see you mom in each other's eyes. Celebrate her and be comforted to know that even someone that you don't know is lifting you up in prayer and that Naomi is at peace. God bless you both  🙏
So sorry girls your mama was the greatst
Thank you Ricky Skaggs for the beautiful words about Mama Judd. And the emotional words from Ashley & Wynona just brought tears to my eyes. RIP beautiful Naomi. You are finally free of the demons that were controlling your mind. Put your arms around Wynona,  Ashley & Larry & comfort them !

Sorry for your loss may your mom rest in peace 🕊️🙏✝️
As a person who has suffered with anxiety and depression (in that order, anxiety being my primary diagnosis) for over 30 years, I applaud ms Judd snr for her strong and public stance educating people about these horrible diseases, which very often coincide.  Yes, DISEASE!   With her family I am grateful that she now dwells in the house of our ever loving, every faithful ever graceful and every merciful Good Shepard!  To her family my prayer is that you Lord will bless you and keep you and makes His face shine upon you during this difficult mourning time. May you cherish your fond memories close to your heart. ❤
Once upon a time, when I was a young woman, I earned a second audition in Nashville for a music producer. But it was not to be for me. At my first audition in my hometown I sang "Rockin' with the Rhythm of the Rain" for a second song. The Judds have always been my girls! I don't really get starstruck, we're all just people, and I would daydream about just hanging out with them at the ranch, having a cook out and simple jam session on the porch with a nice breeze blowing. I also got the gift of a lifetime for Christmas one year and am honored I got to be witness to their last tour together. Wynonna was also the first concert I went to, I wanted to go so badly that I paid for all the tickets for my broke ass friends! I love you Wy. I always have! Ashley you are also among my favorite actresses! And of course I love your mama! She is at peace now! We will see her again some day! I pray love, peace and healing for your family and friends.
So sorry for your loss she was a glorious person she I'll be missed
Ladies I am sorry 😢 sorry this has happened. I am Praying 🙌🙌 for you Both & your families 🙌. May OUR LORD COMFORT YOU BOTH 🙌. May HIS LOVE ❤️ COMFORT USE🙌. May THE LORD GIVE YOU BOTH THE STRENGTH USE NEED NOW & IN YOUR FUTURE 🙌.   With tomorrow being Mother’s Day it will be a hard a hard day for you both.

V. Eternal rest grant unto them, O Lord. R. And let the perpetual light shine upon them.  And may the souls of all the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. Amen.
So So Sorry for your lost words can just be words that might not help.I want to say Winona you had more strength then you thought you had this honey your mother was with you and Ashley believe she was and to Ashly your words were so sweet and honest.I lost my mother Lord give me strength and time
After having to live with my son’s death, why would you want her to “hang on” she was being clawed to death with pain let her go
She is not in your past she’s in your future!!  She moved to Heaven hallelujah
Did anyone ask notice Larry Strickland was nowhere to be seen. Her daughters were the love of her life. I hate to feel this way and I pray God takes it away from me but I don't think Larry stripped him as a kind of husband she needed. She deserved to be built up I'm taking care of. He was known for his infidelities which caused her much embarrassment and it was not her fault. I pray she signed a prenup
I love y'all ❤
These Judd women are strong amazing women. God bless you Naomi.❤️
WY, ASH gosh you two r just as beautiful as mother you came from a pretty family, strong family, so now we have to learn to live with the love she left behind  my heart breaks for both of you my prayers r for your mom as journeys to the other side take care of each other
I love the music that you and your Mom made Wynona, and I have covered some on my channel. Ashley and Wynona you have joined a club non of us wanted to join. May God be with you during this time, and in days and nights to come. 💓
Love you guys .thot &prayers for you guys Larry and family and friends
God Bless all the family, may you find peace
Every time I hear of some one committing suicide I  wish I  could have hugged them and told them how much I cared.
RIP Naomi 🎶
Love n prayers to family they have given so much to the world ....rip.

God Bless You, Naomi, Wyonna & Ashley Judd. Very Beautiful, Strong & Loving . An Inspiration for Humans in Grief. Amen.  Thank you for the Presence of Reality.  Healing Strength for the Broken hearted.
Omg
I feel their pain... But I loved the fact they read the pslam 23
I Will Always Miss Naomi. She was such an inspiration to so many. I have loved her music for a long long time. She will always hold a special place in my heart ❤️.  To many people take mental illness for granted. I also suffer from mental illness. So I speak from experience when I say there is a major stigma when it comes to mental illness. Much of the time the people who suffer from it. Suffers in silence. The stigma needs to stop. People need to stop shunning those who suffer from it. Mental illness is no different then other diseases such as diabetes. It can be deadly if gone untreated. PLEASE PEOPLE STOP THE NEGATIVE STIGMA OF MENTAL ILLNESS.
Glad to see the Judds in the Country Hall of Fame. Laughter can kill the pain sometimes, but Wynonna and Ashley are the two strongest women to attend and being there for the fans and their Mom.❤Lots of Love and Prayers.
Your mom was an amazing person! May God bless you and Ashley, so sorryFor your loss!
She is missed. She was laughter, sunshine, and a clothes magnificent beauty. We need to truly embrace the power of “MOM.” Us mom’s are the superwomen of any family

these woman, all 3, sharing themselves with us means more than I can ever say.
We played, " I can only imagine'" at my mothers funeral. Now I'm praying for the sisters.
She wouldn’t have had them be any other way
Such a Beautiful Joyous Loving Family! Thank You for all the years of country music & entertainment. Years ago all of you looked like three gorgeous sisters. Naomi Judd gave so much love & honesty to the world & loved people so much. We will all miss her. May Jesus give her a big hug for all of us. Naomi Judd's prayers & love lives on forever. Now her two beautiful daughters that she has poured her hope in God into can carry on her legacy. May Jesus & His Holy Angels comfort her husband & two beautiful daughters. Winona &. Ashley You both have many people praying for You & Love You. Winona you have such a beautiful voice & we look forward to enjoying you for many years.
I also suffer from that black hole. Have for 25 yes now. I could not have gotten myself out of the bed to do what they did. Depression is. not  anything to joke about. Some of the funniest people are depressed they mask it well. Robin Williams for example. PLEASE  if you think  that you run into someone with this disease maybe all they want is to talk to someone. RIP Naomi. God bless
I lost my brother this way💔 it's truly awful and I'm so sorry for your pain. Sending all of the love in the world to you🙏
RIP Naomi Judd.  God be with you Wynona and Ashley.  Give you both strength to go thru the next several days.
had a hard life Even though she became famous that happened to so many people In the industry and out. I was associated in this industry not too many years ago. Was she doing anything about suicide prevention and how did this happen or I guess maybe we’ll never know she was beautiful very sad.I do know what she feels like since I went through what she did. Peace
Our Lord has another angel!!
My heart goes out to all of you. Mental Illness is a big deal.Its a hard fight to the demons within yourself. I have severe depression,I dont understand why I feel the way I do. Some days I dont want to get out of bed other days I push myself along. I can relate to both sides. I can relate to suicide and on the other hand couldn't imagine how my kids,family and friends would feel if I were gone. I am sorry about the loss of your Mother! I am a big fan of the Judds! I grew up on there music as a little girl! I can relate to alot of the songs and heard yalls emotions,made the songs more special. Yall are strong women.No one knows the battles we all face and to change a world where everyone was kind and not filled with so much hatred would be nice. Just be kind thats all you have to do. You never know when it will be the last with someone you love. I cant help to cry.  May God bless you all. Sending all my love and prayers  to you and your family.❤
Our Lord has another angel
Depression sucks and I pray for her two daughters
God Bless you both and prayers for your mothers journey to be with the lord.
RIP, so sad to see her go!
My heart breaks for this family.
Loved their music and their beauty inside and out, Ashley Judd is my favourite movie star, especially loved her in Double Jeapordy
*2:35** WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO ALL THESE BITCHES' FACES*
I'm so sorry for your loss. Your mom was a beautiful person. I'll keep everyone in my prayers.
Just keep ur faith girls that is the one thing she wanted to leave u with Our Father God needed another Angel she will always be with you late at night when you need the most she's there God bless
This is so sad ! ❤️😢
I am so sorry for them and they are wonderful to still show up  Lord please give them Strength and Let the public let them mourn in peace
RIP Naomi Judd, many wish you rest in peace and your daughters and husband understand.
Sorry ladies for your loss Namomi Judd is great ly missed
That's what we need. We need Jesus. If you're struggling with depression: repent, receive Jesus as savior, read the Bible & live for Jesus. With God all things are possible. U can overcome in Jesus name.
Condolences to your entire family
There’s no joy when someone commits suicide!!!
Your lead in was a lie.
Heartbreaking but honestly I think they both really hurt their mom in so many ways. I think it really crushed her spirit.
YOU HAVE MY DEEPEST SYMPATHIES AND I SURE WISH THAT YOU GUYS COULD HAVE BEEN INDUCTED LONG LONG TIME AGO !  I'M PRAYING THE LORD WILL GIVE ALL OF YOUR STRENGTH EVERY DAY THAT YOU OPEN YOUR EYES TO CONTINUE TO MAKE YOUR MAMA PROUD BECAUSE SHE WAS PROUD OF YOU GUYS. MY GRANDFATHER RAISE ME ON COUNTRY MUSIC AND WHEN I USED TO SING MAMA HE'S CRAZY AND GRANDPA ( TELL ME ABOUT THE GOOD OLD DAYS) MY GRANDFATHER USED TO REALLY SMILE AND LOOK AT ME BECAUSE HE CAME FROM A SMALL LITTLE TOWN IN TAYLOR TEXAS. I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU GUYS AND I WILL ALWAYS CONTINUE TO PRAY FOR YOU TO MOVE FORWARD IT IS HARD BUT WITH THE LORD'S HELP YOU WILL BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD YOUR HEART WILL ALWAYS HAVE AN ACHE DOING HER BIRTHDAY AND HOLIDAYS BUT KNOW THAT SHE IS ALWAYS THERE WITH YOU IN SPIRIT BECAUSE I TRULY BELIEVE MY GRANDFATHER IS STILL WITH ME IN SPIRIT WHEN I HEAR YOUR SONGS I THINK ABOUT HIM SMILING AT ME WHEN I WOULD SING. I MISS MY GRANDDADDY EVERYDAY. AND I TRY TO ALWAYS MAKE HIM PROUD AS HE LOOKS OVER ME. I LOVE YOU NAOMI MAY YOUR BEAUTIFUL SOUL FOREVER R.I.P ✝️🙏🏾😢😘💔🌹🌹🌹🕊️
Your in my prayers. God Bless you and your Family.
Honestly have always been a fan of their music, their personalities and their love for everyone around them. She will be missed.
So so sad 😞
We need to focus on FEELINGS and Emotional Health, NOT Mental Health. Emotions are not diagnosable and treated with drugs. They don't feed the pharma machine.   The drugs are the problem.   Naomi had the *best* healthcare money could buy. She was on every drug available over the years as well as ECT a few times. She was treated at Vanderbilt Medical Center, one of the most respected institutions in the nation.   Naomi had trauma from her early life, from what I understand. Trauma/PTSD/ C-PTSD should never be treated with antidepressants, benzos, and mood stabilizers which are dissociative drugs and help bury the trauma even deeper, never getting to the root cause of the depression and anxiety.   I understand that the drugs do help some people, but they are harder to discontinue than the strongest narcotics. They cause significant brain damage and disrupt the entire body, every system (endocrine, cardiac, immune, etc).   I am one of millions of people who has been disabled by these drugs for *mental health*. In many cases, including mine, they are used for minor issues of fatigue or life issues that should be addressed in therapy.   In my case, I was working as a pharma rep, driving around Los Angeles all day, every day, and when visiting an MD friend, I was too tired to go to the gym. THAT was all it took for him to hand me a sample of Zoloft. No exam, no testing, nothing. I was disabled by movement disorders and pain a few years later at 39yo, 20 years ago. That one drug stole my life as it does millions of others.   Psych symptoms are also caused by many physical and medical issues, some as simple as thyroid or low blood sugar. Physicians never test for these before rxing these drugs, especially SSRIs such as Prozac, Zoloft, Lexapro, and SNRIs such as Effexor and Cymbalta.   There has been no "chemical balance" identified. The serotonin chemical imbalance theory was a marketing myth by Lilly to sell Prozac. Physicians ran with it, although psychiatrists deny ever saying that a chemical imbalance existed. 🤷  We definitely need to discuss this, but without the lead of pharma who invented the whole "erase the stigma" campaign. It was brilliant. Young women on tic toc and other social media platforms wear their diagnoses like a crown. They are proud to talk about the drugs that they are taking and convince others to do the same.   It is psychiatrists who blew the whistle on clinical trial fraud and led the way to expose the fraud in the pandemic and vaccines.   See Peter Breggin MD and David Healy MD. Both are psychiatrists I've known for over a decade and are leading the investigations into the whole pandemic and 💉💉.   If I took your post the wrong way, I apologize. I've been in discussions on Naomi's Drug-induced suicide all day, every day since it happened. Robin Williams, Hemmingways, Michael Jackson, Prince, Elvis, and many others are victims of the same polydrugging for decades.   Also, every mass shooting and bizarre family murder or drowning of kids has involved SSRIs. The media won't report it and keeps focusing on guns as the problem. They want to ban guns, so they won't allow this information to surface. A very good friend is an investigator in many of the cases. Ann Blake-Tracy PhD. We talk about all of this daily. She was an expert witness in Columbine.   I mean this with the best intentions. ❤️
God Be with them every day help them God Bless them, Let there Beautiful Mother Sing with the Angels in Heaven
God bless to both of you and everyone whose lives she touched either personally or by her music and we can’t forget her acting, nursing, activism for mental health, and all the other venues where she provided love.  Just know girls, you will see her again.  The fact that we will once again see our loved ones—is the only thing that gives you hope when you lose them.  As you get older and closer to your time of passing from this old earth— you pray you will fly into their waiting arms.  Some days, seeing them and our Heavenly Father is the saving Grace that holds us both firmly in place, but yet ready to go when he calls us home.  I have lost a number of family and friends but none more precious than my grandparents who raised me and gave me their all encompassing love, a sense of family, their last name, along with my character, spirit and strength. The other was a dear great uncle who gave me love and helped me when I was still grieving, provided family stories about my grandparents previously unknown to me, and he made sure I was taken care of for the rest of my days.  I believe my grandparents asked God to send him to me.  They are all dear to me and though there are others I hope to see when I get home — these are the three who have gone before me, that I most miss and desire to see.
You lied and wasted our time
Sending my condolence to you're family And to country music singer and band and friends of there I love the the bridge song I love that song I dedicated it to you two sisters I lost my sister April 6th 2015 Buddha had a neck cancer I have no sister no more I only have two brothers it's only thing I have and made love out of town and I don't have a sister God bless you girls keep on singing your mom would want you to do it no she's up and having with the choir of the Angels up there looking down shining on you're girl, I always love your songs no matter what I will listen too you're country music I love all the singers and country music my late father and sister got me into music my dad introduced me the country music and my sister I got her room to it I love all the country singers I just I burned out two phones or more just playing YouTube music from country singers and all other music may God bless you both and keep your chin up I know it hurts that you lost your mama
I have always been a very huge fan of the Judds!🙂 When I was a kid back in the 80’s  my Aunt would put in a cassette tape of The Judd’s  and we would listen to them sing as we drove around Jackson Hole Wyoming. As a child I always imagined myself on stage singing with those two great Women! They are the reason for my great joy and love for music!!! I will always cherish what a powerful and meaningful gift of music they had together and will always have together. All my love and prayers go out to all who are in pain and sorrow for the passing of Naomi Judd.  Love always, Malesha 🥲
Mom!
God bless you all. Will miss your mom?
omg i didnt know till just now. I love the Judd's. Mama Judd will be sorely missed :(   God  Bless RIP <3
My prayers go to you and your family ❤️❤️❤️❤️😤
Mental illness is still so stigmatized.  There are lots of people out there that think people that are successful shouldn't get depressed because they have fame, fortune and a public that likes them.  But of course we have seen and heard about a lot of successful people have taken their own lives.  I am grateful for a strong support group of people that have been there for me.  No telling you where I would be if people hadn't helped me when they did both emotionally and financially.  I can tell you I wouldn't be here.   I know what it's like to be in that place where you feel it's not going to be any better.  A hole so large that you cannot get out.  So Naomi, hopefully you are in the living arms of God and are no longer in pain.  I am praying for Wynonna and Ashley too.  You raised two beautiful and talented daughters.  They are both so brave to appear in public just one day after losing you.    I just wish you were still here giving us the gift of your talent.  I am a selfish fan and would rather have you walking around with us still.  But hope you're happy in heaven.  Sing with the choir of angels now since you're now one.
I heard nothing about her final hours- pain, tears, a celebration of life, etc.
You'd have to really know Wynonna and Naomi to really appreciate the joke about her mother doing most of the talking. I think Naomi would be really touched to know How many thousands of people actually Truly cared about her. We will miss you Naomi till the morning. Wynonna go in grace and the love she left with you and the family. God bless you.
Ashley looks so much like her mama. I feel so bad for the two of them.
My heart gos out two you both !!
How moving to hear Wynona read that Psalm for her mother.  God bless and keep their family
I did not recognize Ashley
Peace be with you two girls 🙏🙏🙏💞
Wynonna and Ashley and family, I'm so sorry for your loss. I was heartbroken when I heard the news. God Bless Your Family!! I love you're music.
Very strong women. Raised by a strong woman. ❤️❤️
So heartbreaking- yet Beautiful 💔💔 - Thank You for posting this 🙏🏻
Blessed and Broken ... For Wynonna & Ashley  Is this happening ... Is it really happening ?? I am blessed and I am broken . I see you mama I really do ... The you that you were blessed and broken . The love though ...the love . If I could have ... I would have lived your life for you ... Kissed away the tears and hugged away the fears . I was proud of you and am proud of you . I don't wonder where you are because you are in the sky world and you are at peace . Love has built a bridge between our hearts for ever and for always .  I have something from you that no ugliness can take away I heard your heart beating from the inside . It was strong with life and with love  . You weren't weak and you weren't a coward ... You were exhausted .  Blessed and Broken maybe but there is the flip side Courage and Faith .  Wynonna and Ashley I don't speak for you .. These are the words I would speak for me . I reached out to your mama and she gracefully reached back . Thank You for sharing her with me and with all of us .XxOo
Prayers to you God loves you girls and He wants to help you through this
God Bless you ladies I'm so sorry for your loss I know what it's like I'll say a prayer for you.
February
That is so awesome the way they are dealing with this!!! 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️
The Judds have ALWAYS voiced their faith and love for God. I’m sad that Naomi suffered from the disease of mental illness. So many many many do. I know she is FREE from pain now but it’s still extremely hard to have trust in God.
A beautiful lady.  She will be greatly missed.  God is watching over you and your mom will be your guardian angel.  Rest In Peace.
Well done girls.  Stay strong.  Your mother was a Beauty and so are the both of you. 🙏🌹🌹🥀🥀🌻❤️
Beautiful girls and the best Duo ever!!! RIP dear Beautiful Beauty of Country music. ❤️🌻🙏🌹❤️
May Naomi rest in eternal peace
We love the Judd family...I am sorry for your loss... your loss is Heavens gain...Wynonna ..you are the last voice to carry on the legacy that you both have laid so many years..carry on girl...your Mom has found the peace she has sought for so long..I am not there but I can imagine being held by the Lover of my soul..the Creator of my being, THE GREATEST LOVE that knew us before we were ever formed...The ONE who held us in all of our fears... your time has only begun...you will live  eternally in the peace that seemed to have escaped you in this earthly realm.... Naomi is not dead...she lives on greater today than ever before...there was a great homecoming that day...she is finally home...what was a sad release for you ..was an angelic reception and joyous reunion with her Maker.
My heart is broken for both of you.  Love to you and may God take care of all of you.
I am so sorry for your loss. My heart and prayer are with her family. We need to give them time to mourn . They don't need to answer questions at this moment. A person who loses a family member or friend or someone you are close to. The press need to leave them alone so they can find out what they need to know. Don't write a story when you don't know what really happen. No one knows what is going on. My ex son in law ended his life along with his second wife. He had been down the weekend before and everything seemed to be alright. We all laughed when we asked how Elliott had done. Jesse Elliotts dad got that smile on his face. We knew that Elliott locked his dad outside. The next weekend Jesse was gone. All the people is let them to under what really happened. And the to arrangement for her family. People need to stop judging on what happened. As I said is she and her family are in my thoughts and prayers.
My heart is grieving.  I know every Judd song.  I have followed them to the last concert.  I will miss you Naomi.  Heaven now has a new angel to thir choirt..  I live in Ashland.  Met your Mom  and saw concerts
GOD bless Wynonna and Ashley. May Naomi rest in peace. Amen.
Thank you for giving the world so many beautiful songs. I will never forget you. God please give peace to your family and loved ones.
Blessings be in your heart's  ❤️😘
My thoughts and prayers are with the Judd family and May the good Lord bless each one of Yuns , stay 💪 and may your mother Naomi Judd R.I.P Love y'all very much and thanks for the great music that you and your mom sang and performed among millions n millions of people!!!! Bless y'all ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I’ve had severe depression most of my life. We are going to miss you.  Mental illness is no game. It’s time we treat it as such. We all love you Judd’s. Lv. Sharol. Your amazing.
Lots of love to you both,  Ashley and Wynonna. As a mother of a daughter, I know your Mama would want other Mothers stepping in for her to tell you how much you’re loved.  ❤️
People always know when they are close to death. I see this often...by what they say.
Such a talented beautiful family. I love their singing and Ashley's acting. God Bless this family .
My thoughts and prayers are with you ladies and God bless you with comfort and strength this mother's day.
My thoughts and prayers are with you girls and your families!!!
The link at the description did not work.
Being the offspring of a diva is a great challenge.
How could any1 NOT LOVE THE JUDDS OR THEIR SENSE OF HUMOR💖💖💖
such a terrible loss and im truly sorry
My condolences 💐 going to the family God bless  prayers of comfort going your way Wynonna Judd and family Ashely Judd and Family love ❤️ you
Dearest Wynonna & Ashley, I am so, so sorry for the loss of your beloved Mom.  I obviously didn't know her but my impression was that she was so full of grace.  If there is one thing I know, as I am a blessed Mother & Nana, is that she would not want you to grieve too long.  I know what I went through over 26 yrs ago when I lost my Mom and Best Friend, and now I often have conversations with my own daughter reminding her that although I know it will be painful for her when my time comes, I want her to remember my words to her when I was alive, which is, for her to look up towards the sky and talk to me, because I will always be watching over her. She knows that I do not want her to suffer in her grief as I've told her what I went through and how it affected my life, and not in a good way.  I know it is one of the most difficult things to talk about with our children, but believe me, if you have those discussions before your time, you are only helping them in the long run, as there will not be the constant barrage of those intrusive thoughts like, 'I should have...', I could have...", "I would have...' .  Stay strong beautiful ladies...gentle hugs from Canada
They gifted my life with such beautiful music and humor.  Saw them in concert 4 times over the years and Wy just 2 years ago!  It's so sad Naomi couldn't be there in person but sometimes being there in spirit is enough.  We all walk our last days to Our Father with different steps and to a time table known only to Our Father.  Naomi is now a shining star in the house of Our Father.
To be absent in the body is to be present with the Lord. She’s singing to JESUS FACE TO FACE! She’s experiencing inexplicable joy! Healed from any and all mental illness and knowing she will be eventually reunited with her beautiful family. God bless you all. We’ll miss her beautiful face voice and spirit but we WILL see her again if we love Jesus so I’m planning on a beautiful concert someday!
They were an awesome team even though there were some touchy moments. There will never be anyone else like the Judd's.Love to the family and sending prayers up for them all.
My heart goes out to you both.She was a very strong lady and one of the great singers.She will always be in everyones heart.
I’m so sorry Winona and Ashley, for your loss. I loved to watch you and your mom singing together, Winona. You have an awesome voice. And I’m so glad you chose your own path and sing your heart out still.  And it’s neat Ashley that you found your own path, too.  May you always and forever walk on the path that leads to Him. And be there for each other. In Jesus name, Amen
🙏🙏🙏
I am so very sorry 😢may the Lord hold you through this troubling time... I love you ❤️

Sending hugs and prayers to the Judd family. R.I.H. AND IN Peace NAOMI.
Psalm 23  King James Version  1 The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.  2 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.  3 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.  4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.  5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.  6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.
Amen
Never be ashamed of God.
So so sorry for your loss. I remember when I lost my mother in 2010 it's still hard but you hold your head up high she will always be with you. Also I love the song you two sang together "Grandpa" 😢😢
💔💔😭😭🙏🙏
We know she is in heaven with lords house amen from a old disabled veteran nam ear god bless
My thoughts and prayers are with everyone. The fact they both got up and spoke says a lot .
Sending my prayers God bless you both this is a very hard thing to deal with the world needs to know more
Sharon here:  I am so sorry for the loss of your mother, and the pain that you've been through ... and will continue to feel as you adjust to her absence.  Thinking of you both, Wynonna and Ashley ~
So sorry what a great lady. She had hepatitis the same time as my husband she survived and he didnt. She really fought
I just wanted to say to you Wynonna and Ashley Judd Thank you for all you did and to Naomi I thought of her as an angel sent by God to us and i love y’all and Wynonna and Ashley you’re in my prayers for your loss of your angel, you’re AWESOME Mom❣️❣️
So sorry for your loss and God bless your family
Wynonna I'm so sorry for the loss of your momma always remember that this isn't goodbye it's we will see you again.  I am really so very sorry for your loss but remember she is always watching over you ❤️
For these ladies to be out on that stage to honor their mother with such heartbreaking poise and grace after losing their mother, incredible.  But I am sure Naomi was watching from Heaven, and letting them know, "I'm here, you may not see me, but "I'm here".  I am so sorry for their loss, and I offer my sincere condolences.
Prayers for peace in your hearts
I lost my parents and know their pain. They're strong women. God bless them both. And may Naomi rest in eternal peace. 💔🙏
Such a hard loss in country music. I will be singing love can build a bridge tomorrow night at karaoke in honor of the wonderful Naomi it's gonna be hard to do without totally breaking down
Love you all so much 💗
Wynonna  my heart ❤️ to you and your family it’s hard to loose someone that’s close to you and you don’t know me love your voice and your songs God bless you and your family  my name is Kathy and I’m from northwestern Ohio stay safe
RIP sweet angel~☆♡☆ We truly never know how someone suffers behind closed doors.  Be kind always...  and.in.all.ways~~ ♡❤♡

Wynoona & Ashley Judd I send you all my love hugs and kisses and prayers and condolences to you dears and your family love always a fan of yours at Naomi be resting in peace with the angels up above ❤️🤗💋🌹❤️🤗💋🌹🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇
So sorry for their loss. Acts 24:15 and Psalms 37:10, 11 and 29 should really comfort them
How very sad that Naomi Judd could not overcome the depression. I could see she was a tormented soul. I have been feeling the same way for the past 8 years since I had my hysterectomy. People say that it's a cowardly act to commit suicide but I don't believe it is. I think those people are very brave. I have been down that road myself with those feelings and it is a very tough decision to make to try to take your own life but it is so difficult to live day by day with that depression and anxiety. The way the world is today sure doesn't help. There is so much hate and evil around. Thank God the Bible doesn't say anything about it being a sin to commit suicide. I pray for the family that God bless him with the peace and strength and understanding to go on. Understand that your mother is at peace and not being tormented daily with depression. God bless you all.
I am very sorry for Winona and Ashley's loss. I understand depression  as well as suicide.   I do however think it was selfish of Naomi...the day before both she AND HER DAUGHTER are inducted? 1 more day for Winona? So wrong
I'm sorry to here about you4 mother.
I LOVE how most country singers have a foundation in Christ & how they don't forget their roots nor their faith. Bless Naomi for bringing her girls up in the faith even though they all went (& still do) go through many struggles. The keep their faith.
Fun fact wynona met Selena Quintanilla when Selena was doing her dreaming of you album wy was doing her album and saw Selena cooking food and asked Selena to Make her a plate as well Selena burst in to the music room laughing telling the music manager wy thought Selena was making food for everyone in the studio to Selena it was a honor cuz she was a huge fan
God bless you girls. Sending our condolences and prayers for comfort, strength, and peace for you all. 🙏.  Much love 💕 Ashley and Wynonna and families.
I have followed all of the judds since the 1980s my families heart breaks 💔 for you all I grew up to your music and wanted so badly to be a young Wynonna so I would sing in our kitchen doing dishes my dad would make me sing to my grandparents grandpa tell me but the good ol days and my favorite mama he's crazy these memories will always be with me god bless you Naomi 🙏 rest in peace  i can already hear the beautiful addition to God's choir
I wonder how the girls feel now about the times they went months without speaking to Naomi over some dumb thing.  I bet they wish they could undo that now.
I am so sorry Wynonna and Ashley. Your mom was a good person. She just had things she couldn't deal with at times. We all go through them, but it's ok to remember the good times with her too. I know what's it's like to lose people. You two are very strong  women. Most people wouldn't be able to cope with something like this. God Bless you both. You will see your mom again.
Wynonna and Ashley, thank you for being who are as human beings.  You are both top shelf. 💔
My two daughters, and my three boys  grew up listening every morning and after noon to the Judd's, My second daughter sang at her bridal shower ,"mama" We sit around singing "grampa" with my older granddaughters.  Your Mother was a Lovily doll. Wyonna and Ashley, your mother's unconditional love, will speak to you though the rest of your life.  You two girls were her everything, along with her husband and grandkids. God's love will keep her resting till the day Jesus calls you home . Reach out like your mother did keep helping others with the blessings God gave you.  A mother of five, and seven grandkids. Love has a way of reaching down, when you need it the most , my mother's love has never stopped teaching me. Live is from God share it. Blessing for your whole family. Jesus is our streagth. Your mama new that. Weak moments does not make who we are. God's love does.
She finally found a cure for her depression.
Much 💘& 🙏 precious Wynonna & Ashley.
God bless Wynonna, Ashley, Larry and the rest of the family, you are loved!
Sending love and hugs to the Judd Family. We love you Naomi.
Ashley and Wynona, your Mother Naomi was such a Beautiful, Sweet, and very Loving Mother and also a very Kind and very loving individual to so many others. I loved Listening to the Songs that were sung by you Wynona and also by your Mother. When I got to see the Judds perform together at the Executive Inn in Owensboro Kentucky in May 1985 it was indeed a very Great event for Me because I got to see 2 Very Beautiful Kentucky Fed and Kentucky Bred Red Heads! Ha! Ha! Oh how you two made that Stage Rock that Night! I became a very big Fan that Night and tried to always buy as many of the Judds Music as I could Find. When I read the News about the Passing of your Mother on Saturday the 30th of April, I had trouble trying to gather my thoughts because the loss was very hard to hear. Ashley and Wynona Please know that you are not alone when it comes to losing your Mother because I too lost my Mother in September 2014 at the age of 85.    May The Good Lord Bless you two and Keep you two safe always.
Lord I pray for the Judd s that YOU hold them close and LORD I pray against that mean depression spirit on anyone ,help them JESUS,AMEN!Lord be with Ashley and Wynonna Sunday on mother's day,they're gonna need YOU.
Having mental issues touching my family resulting in the same result my heart hurts so much for you both.  You three beautiful women have been so much idols of mine.  May you have a point of peace soon.  My husband was a suicide in 2005 and my cousin lost his beautiful daughter Easter weekend.  You are in my prayers.
As someone who has lived this nightmare of mental illness for most of my life I can see why she took her life..She couldn't do another public appearance. Social events are the worst for anyone with depression and anxiety..May she rest in peace now..I can feel in my heart that she is at last happy and free from all burdens..💫💖😇
Sorry for your loss
Wow what an inspiration, Wynona could even be funny. Bless this family. Beautiful women.
It sounds like they knew she was going to commit suicide the way she says they said goodbye to her.
Your mom.did all.she do for her girls.  Sometimes there is nothing left to give.  Remember she her best she could. Hardships during childhoods produces strong women.  Let her RIP.
The 23rd Psalm is one of the most powerful prayers.  There is no judgement, only love.  There is no punishment, only reconciling. ♥♥♥
I love those two women what beautiful souls they provided so many hours of their beautiful music God bless them I pray for the family to have strength and rely on the Lord
Lighting my angel candle.
You girls are so brave and courageous. Thank you for showing up. It meant so much to everyone! Thanks for all the great music and memories. I never missed a live concert when you toured. Lovre you so much! Xoxo
One of the biggest Country Music Icons of all time, now singing for that choir in the sky. Rest easy Naomi.
Fly with the Angels now, Mama Judd & R.I.P.   Grief is always shattering. . . thank you Wynonna & Ashley for being your mother’s daughters.  🥀🥀🥀🦋
God be with you,Wynona and Ashlie Judd!
I grew up listening to them and it is sad 😭 that she is gone
I grew up with their songs. I almost feel this is my family going through this. So heartbreaking. Such a beautiful soul. She raised two beautiful and strong daughters. Heaven just gained a beautiful Angel.
Condolences
So Very Sorry Of The Loss Of Your Great Mom. I Understand Mental Illness I Have Suffered With Mental Illness For 42 Years Now. May God Be With You Now Prayers For Your Fammily.
Prayers  for the Judds family. And for all fighting  mental illness. Prayers
My Condolences
This has nothing to do with Wynonna describing Naomi's final hours and is click bait.  Don't waste your time.
Their music helped me through my own depression. Naomi was a registered nurse just like me. I never got to meet her but I know she was so awesome.
I don't wanna gain the whole world and lose my soul!
Ashley & Wynonna, My thoughts & prayers are with you. Hugs!
I have always loved and adored these strong, beautiful and amazingly talented women. They used their God given talents to make so many happy as they have me. I thank them all 3 with all my heart. I love them all especially Mama Judd. I pray her daughters will find a way to cope with their loss which is abundantly overwhelming when losing your mother. God bless them but know their Mama is up in heaven singing for the Father with more joy and happiness than she has ever known before.
Poor ladies. Poor Naomi. God bless all of them. Find peace Naomi.
Love is forever
I  love the Judd's music and you Wynonna and Naomi was my favorite duo performer of all time Love your music as I mention and you and Asley mom in a better place Love you guys
Don't judge this family,til you have walked in their shoes.  Acknowledge God he shall direct your path. Proverbs: 3-6. 🙏💕💜
The song,rock bottom,is hard to listen to. 🎼🎵🎶
God Bless  you  both 🙏 ❤
This just shows how strong these two women really are. That had to be one of the hardest days of their lives and they handled this wonderfully. Their mom was such a huge part of their lives. It's going to be very hard for awhile. May you rest in peace Naomi and may God Bless you two strong women. Much love. ❤❤

God bless those girls for their courage, we are all going to miss their beautiful mother.
Sending your family my thoughts and prayers 💐 I have followed you and your mom’s singing since I was little.❤️❤️🙏🙏
Sorry Wyonna andAshley
Wynonna, I just want to say, I always wanted to be a country music singer. But, never had the confidence to sing in front of people. Me and some of my dear long time girlfriends went to Myrtle Beach, SC for the weekend and One of my friend's was a     tight wad, but she said if, I would go into the recording studio that use to be on the strand  and sing she would pay for it. So, I could make a recording. And, well I  did it....And , the song I recorded was ,"Momma he's crazy", by you and your precious mother. I hav e always been your biggest fan, always wanted to meet the both of you in person, and I love your sister Ashley as well... love her movies, especially when she played in the movie with Morgan Freeman. But, My thoughts and prayers go out to both of you young ladies, and  to her husband as well as all your family. May the Lord bring you peace, strength, and comfort always. And, put the lord first always good things will always come...keep doing what both of you ladies do...You are talented and gifted. Keep singing and acting I so enjoy you both. God bless❤🙏😊
Make NO mistake about this suicide, this was the final outcome of her being a guinea pig to doctors who destroyed her brain with so called 'mental illness' drugs. They had her on anD off all kinds of these nuerotoxins and each one has a devastating effect on your mental health causes more mental health and physical issues. These drugs cause suicide ideation, deeper depression and is why NO LONG TERM studies are done past 12 weeks on these meds because when they tried patients got worse, a lot worse as time went on. These drugs have horrid side effects and are more difficult to get off of than heroin. I heard her say she her depression was drug resistant. I'm betting she hit tolerance with these meds which caused more issues AND DOCTORS TO USE HER AS A GUINEA PIG TYING DIFFERENT ANTI DEPRESSANTS AND OTHE SO CALL 'MENTAL HEALTH POISONS. Wait till the toxicology report comes out I'm betting her doctors poly drugged the hell out of her and THESE SO CALLED MEDS NOT DEPRESSION CAUSED HER TO TAKE HER LIFE.
I"AM  SO VERY SORRY,MY HEART GOES  OUT TO ALL WHO LOVED HER, ESPECIALLY  HER TWO BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS WYNONNA AND ASHLEY!!!!!!!!!!!!
Naomi is with the Lord now, you can count on that.... and she has joy overflowing.💗
Sorry for your loss girls.  My heart is with yu.
She will be sadly missed!  Be strong ladies.
I do really hope these women stop having all this work done to their faces. They look just so terribly scary.
Thanks for all the music!!!! Sorry for your loss.
Don't cry for me because I'm gone. Smile for me for the days we had to share. Laugh about the moments that we were both able to enjoy. Remember all the good times that's why they call the memories but don't forget I'm never too far behind. You can't see my body because it's been rinsed away but you can feel my love for you every every day. Don't cry for me because I'm in a much happier place pretty soon down the road I will see you and your pretty face. Life is so short don't stop now keep going and going and somehow it will all work out. Tears are those for who have heartbreak but just know don't let it stay too long start laughing like we used to and soon everyone will follow along. Don't cry for me because I'm not there smile because of the life we had to share
May she rest in peace. Such a beautiful person. Mental illness is terrible.  🙏❣️
God love you girls and your family’s❤️🎵❤️
Great mom.great lady great singer great your mom amen miss her
I'm so sorry for your loss 💜
God Bless all of you truly sorry  For your loss. Such amazing  talent  And love
God bless you  and I pray for your healing!
From the moment I heard y’all in 80’s I was singing my heart out with you. Naomi you will be missed and your memory will always be a blessing. Same age, only June and I have fought the demon depression as long as I can remember.  Rip and my sincerest condolences to all who loved you.
Rest in peace sweet Naomi. You're truly loved and very missed. Lots of love, hugs and prayers for Wynonna and Ashley 💞
I can't seem to stop crying, I hope you all are okay and i'm so sorry for your loss. We loved her too, even though we didn't know her personally. We love you all! <3
Naomi, was one of the prettiest, strong, dynamic incredible, women, in my lifetime! I'm 62 and I grew up w her, singing and entertaining and allowing us to experience, a part of her life! God Bless her daughters and KNOW YOUR MOMMA IS IN HEAVENLY PLACES, HAVING THE TIME OF HER NEW LIFE!!!!! Yes, it's devastating, that, she suffered in the end, but, you bet, her Jesus, was waiting, to, welcome her home and to give her back, to The Father! Our Papa!!!❤❤🙏🙏😇🥰
Wy you and your mom will always be in my heart. Your songs mean so much to me. The Judd's forever love you guys
You girls make her proud. Hang in there.
I'm just wondering if they knew she was going to die....the lord's prayer with their mother? It's terribly sad.
I love you guys so much
I'm so sorry for your loss but at least you were there to comfort her and let her know she was not alone...that she was loved. I lost my husband Bill to depression but he was alone when he died, the suicide was stronger than his will to live...I've never gotten over the guilt I feel but someday we will meet and I can say I'm sorry.RIP NAOMI and BILL.
You don't just die of Mental Illness.   I'm confused if she took her life or not.  Not that that matters, but sometimes stranger things happen. ??    RIP beautiful woman
May her soul rest in peace. You and your family are in my prayers.
I'm so sorry for your loss. I loved to hear you guys sing. I've been to several of your concerts and loved every minute of it. I pray that during this time God will be with you and comfort you through this awful time. love you guys. Tina
I am so sorry for your loss prayers for all of you
I’m so sorry for your loss, but really it no good bye it’s see you a little later,
So so sorry to their family for their loss.  Mental health issues are nothing to play with. I too suffer from mental health issues myself everyday. Sending love and respect to all of you who suffer with mental health issues. Honestly I’ve dealt with both mental and physical issues and I would much rather deal with the physical health issues. With all I deal with daily and been thru in my life I try hard to love others, help others and be there at any moment that I’m able to be for others going thru a hard time. Sending love to all of you. Please be kind to others because you never know what others are going thru. A simple hello or even a simple smile to others can change their whole day/life.
I know your hearts are broken. 🙏🏻🙏🏻💔💔
I love these women so much! ❤️❤️❤️
The judds Naomi, Winona, and Ashley. Deserve the respect and love of their family, friends and heartfelt empathy the loss of the beautiful mother. I can only imagine the pain of losing her.

I will miss her. I love the Judd's.  Your songs and trials tribulations of their rocky relationship but always maintained a professional one Their dedication to the music is what made so fabulous.  Their will never be a duo like the Judd's THAT SHOWED US ALL HOW TO BUILD A BRIDGE.  THANK YOU GOD BLESS.

I'm so sorry girls!!! May God give you peace. I'm crying with you. I know how bad your heart hurts. You are in my prayers! 😭🙏🙌
Naomi is a Legend
To whoever is reading this : May God bless you ! You’re gunna do great for ur school year ! Put God first and everything will fall into place ! John 3:16 says , “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life ! WIshing nothing but love , joy , peace, prosperity, faith, hope, etc. Have a blessed day💕💕
My heart is broken over the tragic loss of Naomi Judd. She was so beautiful & kind. Nashville has lost a Legend she will never be forgotten. My condolences go out Wynonna & Ashley and their family and friends. May Naomie rest with the Angel's.🙏
With all due respect for the dead, there is nothing courageous or admirable about suicide. There are many people in this world whose pains and sufferings are tenfold, yet their Faith in God is unshakable. Those are the "brave" ones. That being said may Ms. Judd's wretched soul Rest in Peace.
So sorry for you ladies loss💔 prayers for healing comfort and peace 🙏🙏🕯️🕯️🕊️🕊️
GOD has you girls!  To be absence in the body is to be present with the LORD!  SO grateful that you both will go through this together under GODs capable HANDS.  GOD will use your experiences for HIS GLORY.
They tried so hard to get the hook out of its nose 😂😂😂
We are not Gods counselor or advisor. We do not speak for God. We do not have the authority to say where any of us will be or what we will be doing. We all deserve hell and then the lake of fire on judgement day. 1 John 2:15-17 New Living Translation  15 Do not love this world nor the things it offers you, for when you love the world, you do not have the love of the Father in you. 16 For the world offers only a craving for physical pleasure, a craving for everything we see, and pride in our achievements and possessions. These are not from the Father, but are from this world. 17 And this world is fading away, along with everything that people crave. But anyone who does what pleases God will live forever.  James 4:4 New Living Translation  4 You adulterers! Don’t you realize that friendship with the world makes you an enemy of God? I say it again: If you want to be a friend of the world, you make yourself an enemy of God."  Mark 8:36 New Living Translation  36 And what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but lose your own soul?
Country music is trash
Oh man I'm sorry rip Mrs Judd
I never expected to hear the news that Naomi has left us, I cried so much, what a waste of a beautiful woman. I hope that she's now at peace.
You are three  wonderfully talented ladies.  We will miss your mom very much.  Your mother graduated to Heaven.  We never die, we simply transition to be together again at a later time.  We will always remember your beautiful mother and how much she loved her beautiful daughters.  In time, we will all be in Heaven seeing the three of you perform together again.  Our prayers are with you.  Heaven is beautiful and so is she. CMB

Rev.21:3,4❤️
The night before Naomi’s passing, I was thinking about their song Guardian Angels while looking at my late grandma’s younger photo. Now Naomi is watching over her daughters from beyond. RIP, beautiful lady.
My son had depression and anxiety. He was 22 yrs old. He took his life in 2017. I’ve cried everyday since. I know ur pain. I just lean and trust on Jesus and GOD everyday to help me cope. We need to trust in Jesus. Everyday til we see them again. I know what you are going through. God bless you both. ❤️

My deepest condolences to a beautiful and real family, RIP  Naomi, you have made your mark in this world, go home and rest and live.
My condolences. I have always loved your families music
Their music helped me through my own depression. Naomi was a registered nurse just like me. I never got to meet her but I know she was so awesome.
Omgosh what in the hell did Ashley do to her face? Wow another one ruined by plastic surgery  😪
Is that Ashley????
Totally Humbling 🌷🏵️🌷💕
Just no
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN MUCH LOVED WHY WAS SHE SO DEPRESSED?
I work in mental health as a therapist and crisis intervention. I wish could have talked to her help her. Prayers and love
Naomi told me I’m Wynonnas father
God bless! https://youtube.com/shorts/-TLl4qEBj9w?feature=share
so sad for you girls
My heart goes out to these amazing and strong women. RIP Noami and sing to the Lord!
To lose your Mom must be heart wrenching. My sincere sympathy to Winona and Ashley. So happy they have each other. I am 67 and still have my Mom, and realize how very fortunate I am.❤️
We cannot control the winds but we can adjust our sales may Jesus be with you all and when that role is called up yonder I will be there God bless
Prayers for Wynonna, Ashley and their whole family at this tragic time.❤❤
Losing mom and dad changes your life. What a day of rejoicing it will be when we see em again!
I grew up listening to the Judd's,I will miss her music rest in peace prayers for the family
Naomi will be sadly missed.... rest in peace my darling Naomi..... you have two beautiful daughters who will forever pass your loving memories along.... I love this family and I don't even know them.... Bless you and may much happiness come your way... your mom will always be with you.
Wynonna made me cry with her beautiful choice of biblical passage. I read that same passage to my own Mother as she lay dying of cancer. Losing you Mother is heartbreaking because she was your best friend from the moment you took your first breath until the moment she took her last. I lost my Mom in 2006 and still miss her every day.
🤔 Babylonian Harlots
I read on another site that it was suicide.......
We love your family and always will!
May God heal your broken heart she's in heaven siting on Jesus lap she is with you in your heart God bless you forever
I lost my grandma on April 24. Trusting in the lord… there’s a strength in that. God bless
Dear.      Wynonna.     And.     Ashley.     Judd.     My.    Thoughts.     And.      Prayers.    Are Sent.     To.     You.     With.     Hugs
Naomi RN, singer/songwriter. Rest In Peace. Wynona and Ashley so sorry for your loss.
I feel so much more awful knowing she took her own life, because the brain is a powerful thing. The disease won.😪😪
These 2 amazing women to do what they did. May God grant you peace. Naomi you will always be loved. Thank you for your awesome music. 🙏🏽🙏🏽♥️♥️
mental health issues can be more painful than physical pain. They are often times rooted in traumatic experiences...which calls for deeper emotional/spiritual healing...which Jesus can do for anyone! God bless u all.
Hey! Did you know God is three in one!? The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit! Bless them! Jesus died for our sins, rose from the dead, and gives salvation to everyone who believes in him and follows his commandants!  Have a blessed day, everyone! ❤
Ladies, my heart aches for you both.  There will be a lot of prayers going up for your entire family to give you strength during this time.  Know that you are loved by so many.
Thoughts and prayers  The sky is a little brighter but a light has definitely gone out on earth.  RIP 🙏
The loss of a loved o e is always a shock, and full of pain. May Gods Blessings be upon all those about to exit this earthly realm. Especially the ones that are alone and have no family. Thank you Judds for sharing your story and Gods prayer

they did not call for help??? rip naomi
I'm just here to see if your thumbnail picture of Winona was real. Yeah looks like it. Which part of her is real?   Boy today's country rappers sure are different than the country and western singers I knew back in the 60s.
😢😢😢 Amazingly, strong women🙏🙏
All three of these Judd women are amazing. Love love the Judd music. I could listen to Wynonna sing all day. Such style and great rythem with such a range of voice. Sing on Wyonna. Soar high Namomi.
The world lost such an amazing soul so full of love and kindness and for that I am so very sorry. I will always and forever pray for these sisters. They was one family that grew together in a single parent home and no matter how mental illness was front and center their love and bond was more. I am so sorry to you all and please know she still walks beside you at all times.
Awww love the Judge always inspiring 😔🙏
If this lady commit suicide she is not in a good and pleasant place.  If this family does not know that mental illness in many cases is affected by demons, that explains their spiritual awareness.  They might sing about the gospel but they don’t live the gospel.   Whoever has Jesus living in their heart they have life, and depression has no place in that life. We have to be born again of the water and of the Spirit of God. Then be ministered in deliverance and healing and live loving Jesus and keeping his commandments.  All that glamour and fame is a sin.  Right now God is revealing hell and a lot of these gospel singers do not go to heaven.  And a lot of the followers are in the same boat.  Please do not go to hell. Find out what is required to go to heaven.

I loved the kids They song really good
They want the attention. and money  the same as the person who put this on you tube.  Dead lady's suicide is their new Gold ?
She was actually preaching the word of jesus
So sorry that you are suffering your moms early departure but she belongs to God and he wanted her to come home!!
I don't know about you, but The Judds need a documentary exploring both their lives & careers... Even a YouTube one will do
Sending so much love to the Judd family, RIP Naomi! You were a strong feminine icon for so many women. To infinity and beyond beautiful soul!
I'm so very sorry to both Ashley and Wynona for their loss and for all of us who loved her so very much!!! But she is resting in the Hands of Jesus watching us as our fan for a change!! ❤️🙏❤️✝️🛐✡️👑
ECONOMIC RESET IS COMING. THE MONEY YOU HAVE WILL BE SOON AS WORTHLESS AS LEAVES BLOWING IN THE WIND... COVID 19 AGENDA . ALL KNOWN, AND ALL PLANNED IS THE NEXT STEP. THE TIME WILL COME YOU WIL BE "FORCED" TO TAKE THE MARK OF THE BEAST. YOU CAN'T BUY OR SELL WITHOUT IT. YOU TAKE HELL ON EARTH IS COMING INTO YOUR LIFE. GODS JUDGEMENT, AND THROWN DIRECTLY INTO THE LAKE OF FIRE FOR ALL ETERNITY' GOD PROMISES TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. BECAUSE HE LOVES YOU. THIS TRUTH CONFIRMS THAT THIS WAR IS SPIRITUAL, AND NOT NATURAL. JESUS CHRIST LOVES YOU, AND CAN HAVE ETERNAL SALVATION IN HEAVEN, AND NOT HELL.  JESUS CHRIST IS COMING BACK IN MY LIFE TIME.
Well I hope she does dwell in the house of the lord forever and one day we will all say we missed you.
She had a battle of Hep B or C yrs back..
Wait a minute, Wynonna and Ashley were with their mom when she passed?! I didn't know that!!!! If she passed by Suicide, didn't someone try and stop her?! I don't understand!!!!
So sorry for your personal loss!  Please know that your mother's soothing presence and beautiful voice has been a candle in the dark for weary saints.  So grateful to see that she taught her children so well.  And thanks to the teachers who taught a little girl to sing the 23rd Psalm from memory.

My deepest sympathy to you all.
So sad 😞 😥😢😭 RIP 🙏 you're at home with God
I love Naomi and Wynonna The Judd's live on. I love you guys always and forever.
The only way Jesus can heal sometimes is through death. He is God and Human, finally His being able to understand the frailty we go through. And we all go through it. We have our moments so we get glimpses into another world no one understands. I trust Jesus for the Life He gave me
I am sorry for your loss , she will be remembered
God bless her family
JESUS KNOCKS ON YOUR HEART AND LONGS FOR YOU TO ANSWER!  HE DOESN'T WANT TO SEE ANYONE PERISH INTO HELL.  GOD LOVES YOU SO HE GIVES YOU FREE WILL AND A CHOICE TO ACCEPT HIM OR REJECT HIM.  TO LOVE HIM OR TO LOVE SIN/THIS WORLD.  CALL UPON JESUS & ASK HIM TO FORGIVE YOUR SINS! SURRENDER YOUR WILL & YOUR LIFE TO HIM & HE WILL GIVE YOU ETERNAL LIFE IN HEAVEN!  PICTURE YOUR BEST DAY ON EARTH TIMES A BILLION FOR ETERNITY, THAT'S HEAVEN!  NOW PICTURE YOUR WORST DAY ON EARTH TIMES A BILLION FOR ETERNITY, THAT'S HELL! HE WILL GIVE YOU WHAT YOU WANT SO IF YOU REJECT HIM YOU WILL BE SEPARATED FROM HIM & HIS BLESSINGS (LOVE, PEACE, JOY, HOPE, REST, ETC).  IN HELL YOU WILL BE ALONE WITHOUT GOD OR PEOPLE... YOU WILL BE HOPELESS, IN DESPAIR & AGONY FOREVER!    GOD'S STANDARD FOR HEAVEN IS PERFECTION AND ONLY JESUS (THE SON OF GOD/GOD IN THE FLESH) LIVED THAT PERFECT LIFE!  HE LAID DOWN HIS LIFE & TOOK THE WRATH OF THE FATHER ON THE CROSS FOR YOUR SINS!  GOD IS JUST SO HE MUST PUNISH SIN & HE IS HOLY SO NO SIN CAN ENTER HIS KINGDOM OF HEAVEN.  IF YOU ARE IN CHRIST ON JUDGEMENT DAY GOD WILL SEE YOU AS HIS PERFECT SON (SINLESS SINCE YOUR SINS ARE COVERED BY JESUS' OFFERING).  YOU CAN ALSO CHOOSE TO REJECT JESUS' GIFT/SACRIFICE & PAY FOR YOUR OWN SIN WITH DEATH (HELL) BUT THAT SEEMS PRETTY FOOLISH!  GOD SEES & HEARS EVERYTHING YOU HAVE SAID & DONE.  YOU WONT WIN AN ARGUMENT WITH HIM & YOU CANT DEFEND ANY OF YOUR SINS TO HIM.  YOU'RE NOT A GOOD PERSON, I'M NOT A GOOD PERSON... ONLY GOD IS GOOD!  WE'RE ALL GUILTY WITHOUT ACCEPTING JESUS' SACRIFICE FOR OUR SINS!    MUHAMMAD DIDN'T DIE FOR YOUR SINS, BUDDHA DIDN'T DIE FOR YOUR SINS, NO PASTOR/NO PRIEST/NO SAINT/NO ANCESTOR DIED FOR YOUR SINS, MARY DIDN'T DIE FOR YOUR SINS, NO IDOLS OR FALSE gods DIED FOR YOUR SINS, NO MUSICIAN OR CELEBRITY DIED FOR YOUR SINS, NO INFLUENCER OR YOUTUBE STAR DIED FOR YOUR SINS, NO SCIENTIST OR POLITICIAN DIED FOR YOUR SINS, NO ATHLETE OR ACTOR DIED FOR YOUR SINS! STOP WORSHIPING THESE PEOPLE!  JESUS CHRIST ALONE DIED FOR YOUR SINS & WAS RESURRECTED FROM THE GRAVE!  HE IS ALIVE & COMING BACK VERY SOON WITH JUDGEMENT (THESE ARE END TIMES)!  PREPARE YOURSELVES, TURN FROM SIN & RUN TO JESUS!  HE KNOWS YOUR PAIN & TROUBLES, HE WANTS TO HEAL & RESTORE YOU!  TALK TO HIM LIKE A BEST FRIEND!  ASK HIM TO REVEAL HIMSELF TO YOU & HELP YOU TO BELIEVE IF YOU DOUBT!  DON'T WAIT TO CRY OUT!  NO ONE IS PROMISED TOMORROW! HE LONGS FOR YOU TO INVITE HIM IN, HE LOVES YOU MORE THAN ANY PERSON EVER COULD, HE CREATED YOU!   Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."-John 14:6  "But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my  Father which is in heaven."-Matthew 10:33  “For the wages of sin is death (hell), but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord”-Romans 6:23
Just a beautiful family God Bless them may he give them strength  now to carry on knowing that she is with  the Lord in Heaven !!!! 🙏🙏🙏💕 she will be greatly missed !!!
To the Judd family, I'm so sorry for your loss. She will be missed, greatly.
A most talented family . . I have always loved the Judds, but never more than right now. Psalms 23 was wonderful.
We lost a true gem.  RIP Naomi Judd - You will be missed.  :(
https://youtu.be/5LLoi3sseFo
God bless you both . 🙏 My Prayers and thoughts are with you 🙏
I’m so sorry for the loss of your beautiful mom I lost my mom about 17 years ago there’s nothing more then a complex relationship between a mother and her fairer I had that same type of relationship with my mom
She committed suicide let’s all stop pretending here.
https://youtu.be/m2gdmhnZew4
I loved Naomi Judd.
Click bait: she did not describe her mother’s last hours.
Depression steals every bit of your existence. Sometimes even getting help isnt enough.
This hurts! Praying for the Judd family!
In 2012, I almost died from a drug overdose but Jesus Christ saved my life.  During this near death experience, I cried out to the Lord Jesus in prayer and repented to Him for my sins and He saved my life.  Please repent to the Lord Jesus for your sins and then get fully submerged under water as a baptism to God in the name of Jesus and obey what He wants you to do with your life or if you don't do this then when you die you will go to hell.
This is so sad. I grew up listening to the both of them. It hurts to hear about stuff like this. God bless. We will miss you. I know I will deaply.
This breaks my heart for them.
depression is the worst evil of all, it really affects our society a lot, a lot of strength please, god bless you
This is strength. I wouldn’t be able to utter a word.
May she rest in piece now, God Bless them for this beautiful prayer with their Mother.
Rest In Peace. Now you are at peaceful.
Love and prayers for the family🙏💜
Sending heartfelt prayers to you for the loss of your mom...Gods speed !!!
Rip Naomi. She was so beautiful!
I believe the greatest form of love is shone to us by sacrifice. What we are willing to give up for the love of someone else. Too often and too frequently is life filled with bitterness, anger, hatred, and jealousy. Just imagine what kind of world it would be if we all loved one another, if we all cared, and had concern for each other. That we all did our best to make sure life was good for everyone.  That no one was homeless, that no one faced despair, rejection, or pains of loneliness and self-doubt. That there were no more wars, wars built on greed, and man's fear of each other, fear of the unknown. I think of the ultimate sacrifice when a carpenter named Jesus Christ from Bethlehem faced beatings, whippings, insults, injury, and crucifixion for our sins. who died so we could become righteous, to never again face the fear of death or the nightmares of the pains of hell ever again. a righteousness we could never earn unto ourselves, not based on our performance, but given to us as a gift of mercy. Call unto the Lord Jesus Christ, forsake your sins, believing with all your heart that he is the God who created heaven and earth, and he will gladly forgive you and welcome you unto the family of God forever. ''For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life'' John 3:16   "This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.  For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,  Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,  Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;  Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.  For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,  Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth"  2 Timothy 3:1-7  ''The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us,  not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance'' 2 Peter 3:9
Awe sweet lady rest in peace. God be with the family. BEAUTIFUL FAMILY
So sorry
Such a strrong pair and sad for their loss
God be with you sending prayers 🙏
Jesus loves you. No matter what is going on you can turn to Him. He will abundantly pardon all our sins as He died to pay for them all. Life eternal through Jesus and heaven for those who trust on Him alone.
Rest In Peace Naomi Judd
Just the fact that these women got themselves up out of bed the day after their Mother passed away shows what they’re made of. God Bless them. Thank u Naomi for such great music. I hope u r at peace now 🙏🏾
Most crap! Money has no bearing on one’s health! Religious yet one kills themself?
I didn’t recognize ASHLEY! She has changed so much!
Praying for your family during this devastating time. 😭🙏💔
Bless her she got through it...but I love the joke she made...it helped her and everyone in the room
The most beautiful lady ever. And talented. 🙏🙏🙏
God Bless You, Wynonna and Ashley for showing up today and being so strong!  Let him comfort you in the days to come!  My heart is broken!
Such icons! They deserve this! It’s sad she couldn’t hang on for this day. I loved listening to their music growing  up and loved singing their songs.  She will never be  forgotten. Prayers for the whole family and this very tragic loss.
💔🧡
Sorry  for the loss of your beautiful mom. Love and prayers 💜💞💜💞
How dare you even post
Bless that Family!!!
Love and condulences Judd Family.   Mum left a beautiful legacy.
Mama Judd was such a huge inspiration for me over the years. She was a classic beauty with such amazing grace. I will remember her always and I'll be praying for her girls and everyone who loved her. Rest peacefully Naomi. You are already missed.
💗💗🌈🌈🌈💐🙌🙌🙌🙌
I believe that she was too kind and gentle for the harshness of this world. May her family find comfort knowing she is at peace.
Bless you Judd family and Naiomi! 🙏
Ladies, your mom is now home, healed and whole.  May her peace be your peace, as well. 🙏
In a world being ran by evil elites removing god I loved to see this prayer!
So good to see these ladies are relying on the Lord during this difficult  time.  He is our only true strength.  Also really good to see Ashley mouthing the words to the Lords prayer with her sister.  God tells us in His word, the Bible, (Isaiah 61:1 ,3) that he can turn ashes into beauty.  We all need to pray that the death of beloved Naomi will lead many to God which would truly be the ultimate beauty.  I think that would make Naomi really happy. May God continue to bless and keep Wynonna and Ashley.
Why these people cut their own lives short???... They had it all and still did not know God enough to understand how to live life! No, I did not take the jab(s) either!... Nor will I ever! Put God first!!!... And don't take your own life, you will go when God takes you!
She's singing in heave with Fullness of joy.  We love you, Naomi.
Our Love, Peace and Prayers to you and your family. ❤️
Wynonna and Ashley, I'm left with a broken heart as we say goodbye to your mom. I think I can say that she loved you girls more than you can possibly know. My prayers are with you and will always be there. Just remember that she's not far away she's as close as the wind and she is waiting her arms wide open 'til she sees you again. May our living GOD comfort and bless you as only be can.
This is what you call strong. These are strong women.
heaven isn't real but it's nice the idea brings so much comfort
What a tragic loss. My heart goes out to her family. RIP Naomi.
She was as talented as she was beautiful. And that's a lot.😊
I was broken by this also. Narrator, thank you for the preparation. The 23rd Psalm was my mother's favorite Scripture. I've said before that I'm not a big country music fan but the harmony of The Judds transcended genre.
Only thing to say after Wynonna kissed her momma goodbye there on that stage last night is; AMEN 🕊️🕊️🎶🕊️😭😭🌹🌹

Prayers for “ Wynona ,Ashley n Mr Strickland,My deepest and Sincere Condolences to you all ! Mama’s in a Peaceful and Beautiful Place now with our Lord 🙏🙏🙏💁‍♀️💕💁‍♀️💕🌸🌸
I knew when they said it was mental health I knew it was suicide. Rip Naomi Judd
So sad mental illness...RlP
Rest In Peace.  May God bless the entire family.
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life643
Happy op 🔥🔥
Prayers for these ladies and the fans, friends and family that loved ms Naomi so very much.
I couldn't do nothing but cry my heart is breaking for the two daughters and family.I will always remember her and the christmas movie she played in with Andy Griffith as a music. teacher it was Sounds of the Season.Fly high Naomi
Sad to hear of judds passing. Mom. Ashley an wynona judd your amazing. Sorry to hear of ur loss.
My prayers are with you. I know what it is like to be separated from a mother. Praying for Jesus Christ to comfort you as no one else can. Maples from Gatlinburg.
Ashley judge should be ashamed of herself for what she said in her book about her mother
Beautiful people! So sorry to hear of Naomi's passing. Their music was awesome it takes me back to my teenage years. Prayers for the girls and the rest of the family. ❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏
Praying for you Ashley and Wynonna. Prayers for you to Larry. Rest In Peace Naomi.
Was suicide YouTube afraid to say ?
Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. https://youtu.be/l78FYh9Qkkk
That prayer is NOT for anyone but the people God was speaking to! Ignorance can be cure by education, read the KJV bible.
Ok._ I cried
I remember as a kid listening to the ladies on my old record player.  I miss those days.
RIP Beautiful Lady Naomi 🌹 yur music Will stay for Ever in my Heart ❤️🇨🇦
You’ll rot, then desiccate, then turn to powder and you’ll be where you were before you were born. Nowhere.
I watch it so sad break down and cry all day. Naomi Judd and Wynonna Judd  Hall Of Fame. So proud both them. Let’s Keep Pure Country Music Sound Forever. I got see in concert but was late couldn’t find my ticket or other item but was there half way over. Once in life time. Truly amazing artists mother and daughter singing on stage. Sure holds lots great memories lane though yrs. Thank You.  Ashley Judd was in film movies.     I was late in front Row seat never Forget that day get off work forgot few items. Things do happen. See both on stage once life time. Got there booklet photos hold on to those great memories lane songs and albums though years.   Prayer for Naomi Judd up in heaven now with all great Country Music artists . 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Naomi is a wreck. Always has been.
I know her battle, because I have same battle.  Very sad for you all. 😭
As someone that suffers from depression. I can tell you that it's the hardest thing in the world to handle when suicide crosses your mind day in day out and you fight it with all your heart.Know there will be that one day you don't have the fight in you. Hold your loved ones close don't rely on a psychiatrist all they do is write a prescription and send you on your way they don't help us. Reinforce your love for the individual don't let long periods of time go in between phone calls or seeing them. And no that a nice tight long hug is the best medicine out there. Someone with severe depression like I have I get a hug from someone and they say I love you can give me strength for days it's weird but it beats the lithium. Naomi rest in peace you're in pain no longer and watching down on us. Look how long you fought it you were a success my dear and you will never be forgotten. God has got you now and he'll give you those hugs everyday. For her family no she didn't do this to hurt you she loved you without a doubt regardless of the ups and downs. This was her battle with herself. Said with love and resp ect.Just a little education for people that know someone that suffering from depression 🤟🙏✝️🛐😇
I LOVE YOU LADY JUDDS🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰!!! MAY THE LORD CONTINUE TO BE YOUR STRENGTH & PEACE DURING THIS TIME, LADIES!!!😇🙏😢💞😘😇💞🙏
❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏
There's a new beautiful voice in heavens choir
My heart goes out to the Judd family..🖤🥀 Hearing her daughters speak about their Mother made me cry..🥺💔 You only get 1 "Mama". 🖤🥀  "Thank You!" for the years of beautiful music..🖤  #TheJudds 🖤🥀
Saw Way and mamma when they were so young and I will forever hold those memories close to my heart they were such a special duo and mamma will be missed that's for sure but not forgotten!!
They are in shock, they rose to the occasion for their Mothers sake and did it beautifully. I hope they get the care they need afterward.
I watched the judds docuseries originally aired on own network.  Because of how she grew up she had a real need to have attention.  It was always about her . I have depression and anxiety also ,but I think taking her life the day before the induction was again to put the attention on herself . She took away wynona's big night by killing herself the day before . I thought that was incredibly selfish . The celebration turned into the naomi Judd memorial
I’m not entirely sure what will happen about the speech Wynonna gave, to be honest. I suppose it’ll depend on the time of death. Assisted suicide is illegal in Tennessee, and the medical examiner ruled Naomi’s cause of death as a suicide.  As it stands, they’ve opened a death investigation (as is standard), if they determine the family aided her in ending her life… this story may have a more tragic ending than it already has. 😕
people do this every single day.When my   mom passed we knew nothing of her taking ubers a couple weeks before planning and ordering food and flowers for her own memorial only  the Priest knew at the time.❤ add There are millions of unsung heroes among us people who never get a shred of respect.😢😅 My mom was 93
That is profoundly sad...   and tragic.    May her soul rest in peace.
one thing about the Judd’s there incredible strength there road has not been easy yet they always shined may she rip
❤️🙏✝️😇
She was a legend & so beautiful.lI hate this amazing woman suffered so much more than we the public will ever really know. Bless her heart that the ghost of her past would not let free. She suffered in bondage but yet gave the world Inspiration, wise words, funny stories and of course The Legends THE Judds. Always with a smile on her face as the music is what I feel really kept her going moving ahead. Naomi you are FREE now , no more bondage.. FLY HIGH WITH THE ANGELS . Thank you for all the years you gave us, your fans. You will be greatly missed BUT U WILL BE REMEMBERED FOREVERMORE . GOD COMFORT THOSE 2 BRAVE STRONG WOMEN HER DAUGHTERS WHO WE ALSO LOVE SO MUCH. WRAP THEM TIGHT LORD & COMFORT THEIR BROKEN HEARTS. WE ARE WITH YOU WYNONNA & ASHLEY & POP & FAMILY. YOU MADE HER THE PROUDEST NOW AS SHE IS RIGHT THERE WATCHING. xoxo
She’s beautiful mom 😢💔🙏🏻🤟🏼
Amen
Prayers and Love ❤️ to the Judd Family
Prayers for the Judd family who are left behind to deal with the loss.  Naomi is with the LORD, how amazing is that?  We love you all.
I’m a Latino born and raised in Los Angeles and no singers death has impacted as much as Naomi’s. I love the Judd’s. I wish I could be there
💔😥🙏🏻
Lord where did these women get their strength to show up. G-D bless these women. I pray their momma is resting in eternal peace😭😭😭💔💔
So sorry for your loss! My deepest sympathy to your family!
I can't say what hasn't been said. I had 3 chances in life to meet Naomi, and in each encounter she seemed more beautiful, loving and caring than the last. I'm so sorry that she is gone. Her family and friends will carry the torch of Naomi forever. Rest in Peace, beautiful woman.
So sorry to hear this sad news  What a beautiful soul and a singer.  My heart and prayers go out to you and your family
R.I.P beautiful woman, Naomi.  The whole world is mourning.  God bless to Wynonna and Ashley and the Judd family.
GOD IS WITH ALL . NEVER KNOW ONE'S PAIN. GOD BLESS YOU ALL. 🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
Very sad,,depression and mental illness is real....🙏
God Bless you .. lifting you up 🥰
Condolences  to family and friends and co-workers  of the Judy's. Please  keep  on with your music  and  careers as a tribute  to your Mom.I  think she would have wanted it ,that way.You are strong beautiful  women. 💙👭
It's pretty sad to loose a Country legend like Naomi.  She will be missed indeed.   What happened to Ashley Judd???  She was just a beautiful actress not that long ago.
Always remember mental illness doesn't care if you have beauty, fame, success, talent and wealth.   In  the arms of the angels, may she rest in paradise and sleep in heavenly peace.   LOVE CAN BUILD A BRIDGE...
My most sincere condolences to you.  I lost my mother in 2020 and it was hard to breathe for a long time. I understand  the unknown territory comment. May God give you the strength and guidance you need. May your Mother RIP and sing with the angels.    Also, when you dream of your mother, she is actually visiting you.  Hope she visits often.
Shes an angel now.
So sorry to hear about you mom!
Her last goodbye to a bucket of fried chicken and biscuits.
God bless this family.
God bless she was a beautiful talented lady!!
I'm so sorry for your loss, one of the worst things you will ever go through in life ,besides losing your child I lost both parents years ago and lost my first born child this past October at the age of 39 , just look up to  God and know that was his child he just let us have them for a while and then it's time he takes his children home ,again I'm so sorry and I have always loved the Judd's and I always will !!God bless you all !!         Michael
Ashley, Wynona & family I'm so sorry for your mother's loss. She was beautiful inside & out. You two inherited that from her. I'm from Burkesville Ky. & I have been with you all since the beginning. I've never had closeness like your family & would watch you all just wondering how it would be to be so loved. But my grandparents raised me most of my life & we loved each other so like your family. Wynona I will never forget the day my mammy passed away, I had to take my son out of school for.a week to go down & be with her, we got back to Indy & she went to Heaven the next day. When I lost my grandpa my son & I were by ourselves as we stayed with him until the end & everyone else had left. I was trying so hard to keep myself together for my son but your song "grandpa tell me about the good ole days came on the radio. I couldn't hold the tears & had to get off interstate. A love that I still miss so but like my grandparents your mother will be waiting for you & Ashley & her loved ones in Heaven. God bless you & your family, your songs will live on forever.💖🌹🌷🥀💖 RIP Naomi
Momma Naomi is with the Creator. She's good. But I am wondering if the daughters are okay. Beyond their grief, neither looks to be well.
Wynonna and Ashley. I have always admired your Mom and Wynonna’s beautiful singing and Ashley your amazing acting talent.  I will always love you all.  Thank you for sharing your words about your momma here today.  You are in my prayers. 🙏❤️
She was gorgeous
Grandpa, tell me bout the good old days.....forever applies
Oh dear
*I never met you Naomi here on earth but I will in heaven. I love you*
Thank you for shinning the light on mental illness! It is not a personal weakness; it is like any other disease.
Prayers 🙏
So sorry for your loss. God bless you and Ashley. Rip Naomi. Sing with the angels.
*Why is everyone saying goodbye to her? If you repent (change your mind) of your sins and only believe that God sent his only begotten son to die on the cross and shed his precious blood and that Jesus arose on the third day and confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord you WILL be saved. You will see Naomi again because she was a saved woman and she believed. Don't worry.*
Thoughts and prayers for Ashley and Wynonna. 🙏🏻💔
So did they know? With them saying that scripture around her. Such a sad day that she passed. Loved their music and Naomi was so glamorous. I pray she's at peace. Love and prayers to the family and her husband Larry.
Class all the way girls!
I saw these wonderful people in concert in 1991. When singing "Love Can Build A Bridge, the audience was totally captivated. It was wonderful!
How beautiful Wynona! You honored your mother so.
RIP Naomi you'll be missed
Amen.. Naomi suffered.. she is ok now.
Youll be so missed Naomi but Peace is yours now.
Wow!!!
Prayers 🙏 🙏 love your lady
Suicide? How awful and sad. I understand how bad it can get though.
Ashley and Wynonna...We felt your music, we felt your emotional energy through the years..and we feel your tears... We are here, the fans are always here for you both!  We feel you!
https://youtu.be/Kw8EYKumMMY
Ok ok ok So I went and tried to find out the truth of what actually happened.  So the truth is that she did take her own life by commiting suicide.  So the bull crap that her daughter is dishing out here on this video about them all sitting around her and praying as she was dying is a bunch of lies.
My deepest condolences to your entire family. Rest In Peace Naomi.🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I will never forget when I opened for you both in  1991. Seeing them argue over makeup and dresses was awesome. Totally a great Team! I love you both! Rest In Peace, Naomi
Does Ashley sing? Maybe she could be Wynonnas partner. Wouldnt that be wonderful.
I just heard on the radio on the way home from work that she actually committed suicide . So I wonder who is telling the truth and who isn't ??
A great loss! God Bless her daughters.
MY PRAYERS ARE WITH U AND YOUR FAMILY!!!!
May God bless you both. You made your mama proud by showing up to receive this award so soon after her passing. Be strong and know that her spirit lives on forever.
Today is the day of Salvation! JESUS is the only way to life. John 14:6 Do you know Jesus? Do you have a personal relationship with him? Give your life to Christ. No day is a promise! We must REPENT and believe in the Gospel. There's hope and you can be set free by the blood of JESUS Christ! For God so loved the world he gave his only begotten Son to die for us, whoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life. John 3:16 Once you die it's too late to get right with God. Once you die then comes judgement. Hebrew 9:27...... Jesus saves don't delay Hell is real. Choose life with Jesus! JESUS said REPENT or likewise perish. Luke 13:3  He loves you and he's waiting for you with open arms!
Just remember, your Mom will continue to be your Angel, watching over your shoulders😇
You all are so beautiful! Rip naomi
How could you not cry after hearing this.
I love you all!  Just know you are never alone!  Your Mother is in the arms of Jesus,  she isn’t in pain anymore!❤️❤️❤️
XOXO
🙏🏽💕
🙏🙏🙏
I feel that your mom is at peace now and with God and you will see her again one day in a far better place than this one where there will not be any more depression and fear I also have severe anxiety depression and it is horrible sometimes
Suicide is a horrible thing!  Thoughts & prayers to the family. 😢💙💚💙😊
Help me understand, she died of mental illness. Did she commit suicide?
I'm sure she is with our Heavenly Father, Jesus ❤ stay strong, death is not the end, God bless you all 😊
We will miss Momma Naomi!
My heart hurts for you and your family, I love you Lady WY   GOD BLESS
Wynonna is such an Inspiration to Us All. She shows Us how to have Courage...Hope....Strength to be ourselves. GOD BLESS HER💖
Something in my gut has been making me think that they might have been aware of this going to happen take place maybe Naomi had permission through her physician to have an assisted death also call it a assisted suicide it's when you have a disease or a chronic illness that prevents you from living a full healthy active life and you can get permission to have it done through a physician so them standing around their mother just recently feeling the need to recite the Lord's Prayer over her I got the same intense feeling I just know that I hope she went easy I hope it was pills and she basically went to sleep nothing inflicted traumaticly💙🌈🕊
I don't get this. Why were they reciting the Lord's prayer " right before " she allegedly " committed suicide ? If any of this performance makes any sense to anyone else , great , because I'm not getting this. Naomi was set to receive a lifetime country music award on Sunday , but suddenly decides to end her life the day before the award ceremony ???
They could not help their mother...God Bless them.  The Lord has definitely given them strength.
How did she die? Did she take her life?
Hello!!!!!! The all have a home on their 1,000 acre farm in TN. Can you imagine Ashley and Wynonna walking over the hill and seeing their mothers empty home now?  And Christmas without their mother.  This will take YEARS to get over !!!
Praying for your family 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️
My condolences to Wynonna and Ashley Judd for the loss of their mother.   God Bless them!  Treasure the memories of your mom.   God Bless you Wynonna and Ashley Judd
They are all so pretty 😍
Depression is a disease.  And there's no cure, only medication to help lessen the pain.
Prayers to the family in your great loss - from CANADA.  She was greatly loved.
I loved their music. Never saw them in person.  I loved watching them on TV specials.
Your Mom carried you into this world. Now, you carry her! God Bless, he is your strength and will always be by your side.💞🙏
Holy shit Ashley Judd looks horrible
💧💧💧
Yeah that's too bad may she rest in peace finally after a miserable life she lived. But what have these women done to their faces Naomi Judd was dreadfully plastic Ashley Judd look at her face what did she do with it she doesn't even look human
Their prayer made me cry 😭
So so sad.
Still in disbelief. Praying for Naomi's family and fans. Thank you for giving us so much through your music and making life a little better when we needed encouragement.
Did I miss the part where "Wynonna Judd Describes Naomi Judd’s Final Hours"?
We love you and your entire family.  Stay strong sisters, find comfort in knowing she is well loved and will be dearly missed.  ❤️
The Judd's always respected their fans and we the fans have always loved the Judd's...you have a new angel now
God gives them strength. A memorial to their Mama. RIP Naomi.
Another one bites the dust
damn Ashley. What’s with the Botox?
💔
These girls are so brave!🙏🏽
So sorry for this gteat loss...RIP Naomi
I know I loved and will always love Naomi Judd.   She's out of pain right now... and is still with us.  Just on the other side...she can see us tho we don't see her...we feel her.  MUCH LOVE TO ALL THE JUDDS.  I'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR GREAT LOSS.  TSK.. IT HURTS AND ALWAYS WILL ..I THINK.  I still can't get over missing my beloved Mother.  But I*'m a big baby too.
Naomi knew she was loved. She fought a battle that others have fought against the  crippling, emotional and physical  pain of Depression. She stayed with us as long as she could , out of love for her family , friends, and fans. May Naomi now rest in eternal peace.
Love her !!!
To know she took her own life probably hurts worse
I cannot believe that Naomi is gone. I cannot believe they made it to the ceremony. What a beautiful statement to a beautiful talented and amazing woman. Losing a parent is unbearable and my deepest condolences go to the family.
It’s in scripture that taking of one’s own life will mean you spend eternity in hell. I’m so sorry that you felt like this was the only way out 😢😢😢😢
Love your mom!
We put together a video .. to make money off of someones death.. please make sure to like and subscribe... more trashy Youtube 'creators'  .. the reason ad blockers were created
My heart is broken on that first night I watched love can build a bridge because I hadn't seen it in a long time. I just wanted to be close to her life the way she told it. I wanted to be reminded of her ups and downs so that her ups could remind me of her hopes, loves and joys. Depression is real I'm 50 and have experienced every day of my life so I have a good idea as to what she was going through. Several of my friends have killed themselves I think I was about 13 when my first friend shot himself in the head. Right after was the first time I tried to kill myself. Over the years I've tried multiple times, but for some reason or another I failed. I still fight depression to this day however I've hit a point in my life that I need to live for my family. I've learned that death will come in it's time and what's meant to be is meant to be. God was ready for Naomi or he wouldn't have taken her.  God saves us in some way or another. Down the road her suffering could have been far worse for all we know. Naomi I know your in great hands. Sending love and prayers for her sweet daughters, her husband and the rest of her family. Please seek help if you feel like you can't keep going
I’m so very sorry for your loss! I’ve been a fan from the start!
Naomi Judd is at peace and so very proud of het girls.

I’m so glad that Ashley was there to support her sister. They could have requested to cancel the event or declined to attend. The world is still in shock so I can’t imagine how they must feel. Such a touching tribute to their mother. God bless them.
Naomi was a woman of God, who loved the Lord. She is in heaven now. Rest well in Jesus dear Naomi.
We love you. Fighting depression daily I feel what Naomi went through daily. My heart goes out to you girls. She is not hurting any more! You will all be together one day.
May the Lord Jesus Christ heal your hearts and bind your wounds  In Jesus name amen
Amazing induction and heartfelt tribute to an icon of country music!
My thoughts and prayers are with the family. I🕯
May the good Lord be with you girls and your family and wrap you all in his amazing love and comfort! ♥️🙏🏼💔😭
🙏🏽🙏🏽❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
My heart is broken for my fellow Kentuckians ~ and sisters from Ashland. We love you all. 💙
She was SO beautiful! And mental illness is SO ugly! 😭💔
The government is going to hell.  Hollywood is going to hell. Thank you Jesus for country music.
Sisters, I know your pain! I lost my mother in January 2021 to depression. She was my best friend. I never got to say goodbye. I went through Hell for 6 months, never thought I’d ever be feeling anything but sadness. I’m coming out of darkness, Jesus is my Lord and Saviour and I will recover with grace and mercy.
My deepest condolences to Wymonna and Ashley may God be with you in your time of need Ms  Naomi is an angel of God now may she be at peace
May God Bless you!
The Salvation message is the (death, burial and resurrection of Jesus) this is the Gospel of Grace. Believe it with your whole heart and that it was done for you then the Holy Spirit comes and takes up residence in You and You become a new creature in Christ. Amen.
It's under investigation, why where they all there, was it a legal suicide, there are some that die with papers it if legal., ...but what happened..
My heart is broken for the family. This feels all too close to my heart and soul right now. I am currently in hospital for depression, anxiety and PTSD. I tried to exit this world last week, but I made it, it's a lonely place for someone to hurt that much, I wish Naomi wasn't one of us who have to fight this illness.
God bless you girls, and Larry .I pray for your strength through these trying times.
I’m so sorry for your loss. I’m a big fan of y’all’s
So sorry 😞
Rest in Peace Naomi. Truly a legend.
Sending love and prayers🌹
Prayers go out to great ones.
These women were part of my childhood dear lord ....they are all beautiful strong and an inspiration 💯
God bless to all of you.
My prayers are with wynonna and Ashley.
Naomi Judd was a talented and beautiful lady. So sad to see her go. My condolences to her family. And fans
God Be With Wy and Ashley
God Bless them 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼💜
Funny story, As a fundraiser for the Fairfax Va. High school wrestling team. We the students/wrestlers worked the event for the lovely Judds as they were called at the time. I forget who else was in the show, I think it was BJ Thomas. I know one thing though, every one of the members of our wrestling team wanted to meet these two beautiful women after the show. These women were so gracious and kind, they arranged to take time out of their schedule to come back into the gymnasium to greet and sign autographs for all of us kids working the show. I will never forget their beauty and grace that day!
R.I.P. NAOMI. So glad I got to see you in 2000 on my 7th Anniversary on a reunion concert in  Nashville Tennessee. Love you both. 💜💙💚💛🧡❤️
Ashley "use" to be so beautiful
🙏💞
https://youtu.be/fJVrRWyJ5ws
Love you Judds. Our prayers are with you girls and Naomis’ hubby. You have an angel watching over you now. RIP beautiful Naomi
She will forever be missed and loved!! Much love to you all!
Stay strong girls she’s in a bette place
so truly sorry  for your loss! God bless!
Love CAN build bridges, and the bridge it built between the Judds and their fans, will forever be solid and true. Sleep now Naomi, be at peace now, and sing with that beautiful voice harmonizing voice with the Angels where you are no longer in pain. We will miss you, but we understand and will forever love you! RIP
My prayers and thoughts are with you 💖
Not sure why that last part would make me cry... What makes me sad is what Naomi did to her poor daughters by committing suicide.
Mental illness means she killed herself.
You don’t know how strong you are till you have to be! I just lost my mother all the sudden same age as theirs. I loved them it shocked me I actually read her book she battled I still do it’s a different disability of the brain because you can’t see it. R I p beautiful
I tell you what, the fact that they got themselves together to be able to show up to honor their mother just one day after losing her, is some serious strength. We love you Judds, Naomi will be so missed. ❤️
Psalm 23 say Psalm 91 and Psalm 109 instead
Suicide that’s what happened. Lord have mercy. So tragic. May she Rest In Peace finally.
It's good to know that Naomi knew about the Hall of Fame induction before passing.
She was such a beautiful lady so sorry to hear that she passed .  Rest in Peace❤️❤️❤️ in Jesus name and that he brings comfort to your family.
Sorry for the lost of your mom. I lost mine in August so I know what y'all are going through
Be strong girls , your mom loved you so much. RIP Naomi
Prayers for Wynonna and Ashley. They both are very strong women because they were raised by a very strong woman. God lay your hands on them as they go thru this rough timr
Naomi probably felt unable to show up there in her state of mind. So incredibly sad!!! 💔😭😇
Praying for you girls!
Lord please give them strength during this sad time.
Bless her soul. She fought so hard...Let's all show more kindness, for you never know who needs it. More Love 💘
RIP in peace women.
A beautiful woman with eyes that always smiled and a beauty that Angel's are made of from the inside and out. Prayers for the sisters may they feel the presents of their mother with a sweet welcome when the world looks dark and lonely.
Rest in peace 🙏
Love you Judds! Always have! Stay strong - keep the faith! Joy
LOVE, PEACE,GRATITUDE -  ALL GOOD THINGS—POSITIVE LOVE AND LIGHT —SENDING ALL UR WAY. 💖
God bless the Judd family. You shared a picture of love by your devotion and faith.
Rip and prayers for the family 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
God Bless  you both.
May you rest in peace Naomi. You will never be forgotten, and you will live on FOREVER in your music. God Bless you!💜💜💜💜
Wow!!! Strong and dear you both are, Wynona & Ashley ~ Lord, Thank you for these dear ladies, and their Mother, Naomi. You all have always been classy and human 💗🤗 My heart goes out to you right now in this time of loss ~ 🙏🙏🙏
I know it’s hard losing your mother, but Ashley Judd is still a disgusting human!
Naomi was an amazing woman who raised two beautiful, strong and spiritual women! The music and movies are just the surface of who you three ladies are. May the Lord comfort you girls in your time of pain and may your memories help you heal. Your fans love you all and we won’t forget the lessons she and you girls taught us!
Loved your mom loved your music as a duo..she will be missed. Hugs ladies I know how hard this is for you both
GOD BLESS THEM ALL.  SUCH JOY THEY HAVE GIVEN TO SO MANY FOR SO MANY YEARS. GOD SPEED!!!
I think she was depressed from her illness
Now Naomi will finally be at peace 💖.
This is so sad. I’m glad they have each other to lean on. Prayers. 🙏🏽
LOVE THE JUDDS!!! RIP NAOMI!! WONDERFUL PEOPLE!!! GOD PLEASE TAKE CARE OF THE FAMILY GOING THROUGH SUCH A ROUGH TIME. GOD LOVE EM!!!
Naomi passed on so much strength to her daughters ❤️❤️❤️🙏😭
To Wynonna and Ashley The little things that you remember, the quiet moments, smiles and laughter. In time these memories will push their way through the pain, like spring flowers through the frozen ground. Yes, your loss will always hurt, but in between there will be happiness again. With Deepest Sympathy for your loss. I lived in ashland ky and new Naomi mother when you all started back in the 80s. Love and Prayers sherry

I am so sorry for your loss. I know there are no words good enough when you lose someone you love. Prayers and blessings.
So sad to hear the news...I always loved you all!  Be it music or movies, what a wonderful family. May the Lord comfort you all in your greatest hour of need

Missing a beautiful legend right now. God Bless you and your family.
I love your mother and your music, I always admired her swagger, and you guys and a team and family supporting and respecting each other’s craft, I pray that God will comfort and strengthen you, I love you guys
We will miss Naomi Judd so much! My family and grew up listening to the Judds. We was planning on going to the final tour in Grand Rapids Michigan this September. Hopefully the tour will go on to remember Naomi in her honor and we will still attend the show. We will sing with Wynonna all of the beautiful songs that her and her mom wrote together!
What happen to ashley Judd’s face? She use to b so pretty. Did she have a botched plastic  surgery? She didn’t need any procedures she was beautiful before it.
Prayers to her family. Loved their music and their voices Naomi is singing with the Angels now. RIP 🙏🏻
She passed on the worst day of her life. Waiting to see who cared about her.
My prayers go out to Wynonna and Ashley and all the family. All of her loving fans are HEARTBROKEN,  she was such a special Lady.  When I lost my Mother years ago I was devastated.  Just REMEMBER SHE IS WITH JESUS AND WATCHING OVER HER GIRLS FROM HEAVEN. SHE WILL LIVE FOREVER IN YOUR HEARTS SHE IS ONLY GONE FROM SIGHT.  GOD BLESS YOU!  REST IN PEACE NAOMI. YOU WERE LOVED BY SO MANY AND WILL BE MISSED BY ALL.
So painful to watch....I believe she is free now and may God rest her soul.
Very respectfully done!
My heart is with you both Wynonna and Ashley .. 1 Thess. 4 : 13-18
No more pain! no more suffering!she’s in the arms of the Lord . our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  it’s not goodbye it is until we see each other again one day! you have my deepest sympathy😔🙏🏻
God Bless these beautiful ladies. I lost my mom in 2013 to cancer. I understand. I love you all.
I have that scripture on me all of the time, hanging on my key ring. The scripture is Psalm 23. the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want. surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. my condolences to Naomi's daughters, Winona and Ashley. I pray that God covers them with his cloak of comfort and strength. Naomi Judd, reminded me of my mother, a single mother that gave all her strength and never gave up to make sure that her children will grow up believing that God exists. God Bless The Judd family. Fly high Naomi to the pearly gates and see how awesome that place is. 🙏
I'm so sorry for your loss. May God bless everyone close to Naomi .She is missed by thousands , I know you can feel her presents  next to you. Thank you for all the beautiful songs & funny stories.  God bless you & your sister and bring you calm & peace. Love ya'll. :(
That's the primary scripture of comfort for us Christians. It's the 23rd Psalm. Beautiful.
So sorry for your loss. You are strong and blessed. Keep your heads up
It was not a surprise. The girls knew their mother was planning on ending her life before the ceremony. 😢 Wynonna  had been estranged from Naomi in the past. It was a difficult mother-daughter relationship. Hopefully they will bring the truth to the surface in due time.
Naomi told me I’m Wynonnas father
I hope your soul is at peace now Naomi🙏🏻😇🥰🥰🥰🥰 God bless you Wynona and Ashley🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I've never been able to speak at an event regarding a close loved one's passing... not my mother... nor husband... nor father.  I can write about it quite well... but to speak? No.  And I speak for a living as a teacher... so I am truly touched and amazed how strong and eloquent these women were.  I do love country music but I don't have that many female artists that I truly admire... The Judds were one... right up there with Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton, Reba McIntire, Trisha Yearwood, and a few others.
Love the Judds!!! RIP Naomi!!! 🙁🙏🏻🙁
So sorry for the loss. Of. Naomi. She was an awesome woman and. She will be missed
sad
I hope she will sang the grandpa song for my daughter, because my daughter loved that song. RIP Angel
Tomorrow isn’t promised! So love them like it’s your last. 💕
I will always be Wysguy
God bless you all🙏❤
So, so sorry for your loss, I know she is in a better place.  May God comfort you and bring peace to your heart and soul.
Incredible strength, a beautiful way to honor their mom. RIP Naomi.
Remember, not beauty, fame, success, talent & wealth can escape mental illness.  In the arms of the angels, may she rest in paradise & sleep in heavenly peace.  She is surely singing with the angels in GOD's choir now.  LOVE CAN BUILD A BRIDGE...
Our hearts are also broken.  She will be remembered as a beautiful woman inside and out!  We are so very sorry for your great loss!!! May you find comfort in knowing that her pain has ended and home with our Lord❣️ 🙏🌹
I'm not a Country Music fan at all, but I was very sad to hear that Naomi Judd had passed away. She and her daughter Wynonna had a very good and great sound. Naomi will truly be missed 😢  Blessings and comfort to her family as they go through this very difficult and sad time🙏❤🙏❤🙏❤🙏❤🙏😔
God bless you both for the loss of your momma. She was loved by everyone and touch all of our lives. RIP you beautiful soul
My heartfelt condolences to both of you. Hod Bless You!!!
Whynonna, Asley, Elijah, Gracie and Larry were all blessed beyond words to have had the lovely Naomi as part of their lives. May God welcome Naomi into his kingdom, and may God comfort her family through this difficult time
So, so sorry about your Mom . I loved her as I do you girls . She is at peace now . I hope that brings you both peace too . God Bless your Mom and you both .
Their is no pain like loosening a love one , how strong s these beautiful women , I know what their are going through I lost my mom also.
I'm really sorry Wynonna and Ashley about your Mom. I think she was an amazing woman.
I am so sorry.
I am so sorry for the loss of your Mother. My deepest sympathy . Congratulations of your induction at The music Hall of Fame.
My heart hurts for you ❤❤❤
God Bless you all!
SO SAD SHE COMMITTED SUICIDE... A DAMN SHAME. JUST CAME ACROSS MY NEWS ... SHE COMMITTED SUICIDE 💔😭💔😭💔💔😭
This was so touching! We lost our Dear sweet Mother two and a half years ago and this was not easy I know. You both are in my prayers may God bless you always!🙏🙏🙏
My heart goes out to Wynona and Ansley prayers to all of you❤️🙏🏻🌹✝️💞🥰🌷❤️‍🩹
I know this hard pain myself - 13 Jan 2022 at noon precisely. My mother loved the Judds. All I can say is: "Love not only can build a bridge, Love is the bridge itself." RIP Sonja and Naomi 💝
So sorry for your loss WY & Ash. I was hoping to see you guy's on tour. You have been on my bucket list. I totally understand your loss & what ya all are going through. My Mom has been gone since 2007 at 61. God bless you all. ❤️🙏🏼❤️🙏🏼
Prayers
Sorry for your loss she was a wonderful woman and she will greatly miss and was greatly loved
👑🌹🙏💐✝️
My deepest don't says to the Judd family Wynonna and Ashley so sorry for your loss The Judds music we live on God be with you until we meet again
I've got tears running down my face as those words fill my heart ❤️ God bless those two lovely daughters of momma Judd. May the lord guide them thru this painful storm & I pray your broken hearts can mend...  I lost my momma not long ago too ... Maybe my momma can be part of the welcoming into Heaven... Wow sometimes living sure hurts so awful bad...
There's  NO WAY she died of mental illness. Something else happened suddenly. This is Bull Crap. You can't tour with mental illness. How ridiculous!
My heart goes out to the family and friends with prayers lifting them up. May you all feel Jesus' embrace🤗
I've known of the Judds all my life, to see Ashley or  Wynonna without their mother... It's surreal.🙏🏿😔🙏🏿
Naomi’s death and tears aside, I think it is appalling that it’s taken until 2022 to get these 2 iconic women into the Country Music Hall of Fame.
Wynonna, and Ashley, and Larry, and families, I'm so sorry for your loss.May you find comfort in the Lord Jesus and your memories of your beloved Mother, and Wife, and Grandma. Praying for you all. God Bless you.
Prayers and for Ashley and Wynona and whole family. Naomi was amazing lady. 💔💦🙏
She is dancing in Heaven. Why is death such a drag, yes it’s our lose but she is free! Lookin at Jesus!
Did they know she was going to commit suicide?
So sweet Ashley thought of Larry, their “Pop” Naomi’s faithful loving hubby of 32 years and asked others to love on him right now. —
God bless them and give them strength! I heard that the treatment that Naomi was receiving, wasn’t working. My heart goes out to her for how much she was suffering with this illness. May she Rest In Peace. Prayers go out to her family at this difficult time. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
👍👍👍👍 My Héart & Prayers go out to The Daughters!!❤️❤️❤️ I remember when they become Famous!! I was Blessed to see The Perform in Shreveport, Louisiana & Wow Wow, the Beauty & their music was so Great & Grand!! We Love Y'all!! "Peace Be Unto You by Our Father God & Our Lord Jesus Christ!!" ❤️❤️❤️❤️🌹🌹🌹🌹
Godly righteous Naomi. RIP- you did so much good and were an inspiration to all. This family leads so many to trust and faith in the Lord. Such a Blessing to the world.
I also suffer from mental illness. My heart just breaks for them. RIP Naomi Judd May you be free from pain.
I hope the doctors went beyond the usual meds. She was taking Lithium. Lithium is not an antidepressant.  I had severe depression and got no relief from SSSRis nor Lithium. I got relief by tracing my severe depression to five foods I was eating.  As long as I avoided them I was fine. Antibiotics meant for a sinus infection eventually cured my depression.  Antibiotics are curing many cases of severe depression.
💔🥲💐
Pure love!
Ashley looks like her Mama. RIP pretty lady.
Peace and blessings to the family.
I love all of the Judds. I am so sorry you've lost Naomi but in her spirit you will rise! Rest in peace Naomi and always know we love you too!
My prayers are with you all. I can’t amagine the day I lose my mother    I’ll be devastated. Love you all
Naomi would be so proud of her daughters, strength and dignity in the face of tragedy.
I think it is to advocate for mental health - they are doing this for everyone
Wynonna Judd I hope you are still going on tour this fall!!
She  will be  dry
*Never mourn.... Celebrate instead!  <<<<< Took 4+ years to learn!*
She was A Beautiful Lady  Keep your moms memories close to your heart  young ladys she will always be watching over you  RIP Naomi fly high with the angels
I'm gonna miss Naomi Judd!!!!  Bless you Wynonna and Ashley!!
I'm deeply saddened to hear of the loss of your mom. I'm sorry for your loss. I love you all! 🫂
Have always loved the Judds…she will be missed 💔😭
My deepest condolences go out to the family of Naomi Judd. I have no words about her career. Only a profound sympathy for Ashley and Wynonna.
Other than the rags to riches, singing part, my life is pretty similar to you ladies. Struggled growing up with family secrets and wondering where food and safety was coming from if not for my mother’s sacrifices.  I recently lost my mom in October 2021, along with my brother, my stepfather and my dog,all in a two week period. I understand what it takes to make it through the heartbreaking pain.  I am sending you healing thoughts.  May your mother Rest In Peace.
Wynonna, Ashley, and the rest of the family, please DO NOT allow yourselves to feel guilty about your Mom's passing.  You all did the BEST you could.  God doesn't ask any more of us than that.
I know how hard it is to lose your wonderful loving beautiful Mom 💔I lost my in 1984 at the age of 31 and my life has change since her passing. Not a day goes by that you two will remember all the fun and loving ways of your Mom.  My heart goes out to you both on your big lost of your Mom. I know you girls know your Mom is now sleeping in the arms of Jesus.  The Lord Jesus Christ will carry you both through this difficult hard sad times. May the lord watch over you all and bless you.  Rest In Peace Naomi. You will be very missed by so many. I thank the Lord we have your songs to still listen to. 💔🙏🏻💔🙏🏻
Wy and Ashley soldiered through their grief like warriors✝️🤍🤍Rest now Mama Judd💔💃🙏🌈
Grandpa tell me about the good old days.
my sympathies
I am so sorry for their loss. I lost my husband on the 27th so I know how much their hearts are hurting. RIP Naomi.
Such strong women ❤
My father ingrained a deep love of country music in me the whole time I was growing up. And my parents took me to see The Judds perform live, many years ago, as an adult. I was totally mesmerized by this beautiful mother and daughter duo, obviously so connected,  with such beautiful voices. They could pull you right in to their music. I later became aware of Ashley, and her accomplishments. Naomi was obviously a loving, caring, mother, who did everything she could to raise strong, beautiful, independent, daughters, even while battling her demons. RIP Naomi. Your music and your legacy will live on. My heart breaks for your children, family, friends, and all your fans, that I know are devastated right now. I hope you finally find peace.
Naomi Judd sweetie u will be blessed. Wyonna Judd I sang your song love can build a bridge when I sing karaoke in a bar. I heard your music through out my life and it was the greatest in country music. Your mom will be flying high with the angels. Keep strong my friend. And keep singing.   Sorry for your loss.   God bless u and your family wyonna
Super sad day😢.  My Mom passed InApril last year.  I can imagine what they are going through.  I am so sorry !   I don’t know if I could have went out the very next day.  God bless and prayers to them. 💖My Mom was a huge fan and so am I.

Every ending there’s always a new beginning
You will never be forgotten sweet Naomi, rest in peace with all the angels above, prayers for the family!
Mental illness don't play.  For those of us who were there at the beginning of their singing career, our hearts are broken.  Our memories are full of all the songs.  And, we will champion Wynonna as she continues to herald us with her comforting and amazing contra-alto.  My heart goes out to both Wynonna and Ashley and all the family, friends and fans.  I never had the privilege to see them perform but I'm thrilled to own a copy of Naomi's cookbook.
Naomi has a Sweet, Sweet Spirit , and I Understand .
All my love 💓 to the Judd's, family.  Have always loved them and will always do!
Such a beautiful FAMILY, inside and out! I will forever miss Naomi! My wedding song back on 05/24/98 was “How did you get to me” by Wynonna! Please keep the JUDD LEGACY ROLLING! RIP NAOMI JUDD! God’s got a beautiful angel now!
Love these women… rip Naomi
Wynnona and Ashley, I pray that y'all get through this period soon. Love y'all 🤗🤗
Rest In Peace beautiful. ❤️
God bless u, John 3:16!   That’s all that matters!❤️🙏

Thank you for honoring with some integrity.
My heart goes out to both of u girls God b with all of u though this time

So very sorry for your loss.. Ive loved yall for years
That gave me chills!
GO HOME! Geez! Not if you commit suicide!
So very sorry for the loss those girls must be feeling.
I am very sorry for your losses of your mother. Will always be a music icon in country music.
Thank-you VERY much for this tasteful piece. So much better than anything in the mainstream. Rest In Rhythm Naomi
Ashley Judd- I just read you never “bred” because the impoverished children of the world. I speak as a citizen of the city which you were “bred” And got a high school diploma in- %96 of YOUR, our hometown are “impoverished” below the worst of poverty lines. Net worth of 18 million- if you have 1,000.00 dollars to each of us struggling citizens in your hometown- it would change lives. Most of us work two and three jobs and are still drowning. Your mama would love to see you rise up for the people who are now rallying for her
Amen, Wynonna. Amen. Surely your Mama is in the presence of the Father, basking in His light, and singing praises of His glory. Bless you and Ashley. You both gave great testimony about your Mom.
stand by yoyr man yes sir?
we   are  sorry  for your lost   my god take her to  the havens  your friends  from  canada
Aww so incredibly hard. God with us, God for us, God in us.
This ceremony could and should have been postponed.  Wynonna and Ashley should never have been put through that the very next day.  Shame on you Country Music Hall of Fame!!!
They were awesome like no other you ladies were so blessed by having such a wonderful mother, I meet her in BatonRouge, La years ago was a honor, just for you ladies your speech was totally beautiful 🤩 make you’ll know will always remember all the blessed times of her life was special of fans, ever since came on the Country artists format 😍🤩👍🙏♥️
I’m so glad my mother came to the lord before she passed the town drunk till about 65 she served the Lord about 16 years a different woman a drunk  became a saint Thank you Lord
She was such a beautiful woman inside and out
God bless this family right now.. I'm at loss for words
Rip i have been at your concerts love your music. You are in my prayers. God bless you
capitalism is driving everyone to self destruction and taking the planet down as well. Christianity is a slave religion
Prayers for the family.  Thank you for the music over the years.
Naomi Judd, you are now in Heaven singing with the Angles. Thank You for the memories,  Rest In Peace Beautiful Lady.
Thank you for sharing this I have abeen a Fan of Naomi Whynonna & Ashley For Many years I was Shocked & Sad Saturday When I heard About Naomi's Passing
May Niaomi ‘s soul rest in eternal peace. My prayers and thoughts are with her strong beautiful daughters Wynonna and Ashley and her husband.  God heals and comforts those who mourn.
What did she die from?  People don’t die from “mental illness” so it sounds like she might have overdosed.  I hope we find out soon. She had a wonderful career and very fruitful career.  God bless them all.
Beautiful reflections of their momma
Thank you so much for making this video. 😢❤️💔❤️‍🩹
Suicide is....
I'm in nz and I'm watching from afar, God bless and comfort you girls and your family. The Judds have got me through many bad , sad, and happy times, my daughter and I have a special connection because of your music. Please know we are praying for you at this sad time , and your beautiful momma is in heaven with her Jesus xx
Be strong both of you for you momma she loved you more then you will probably ever truly know!
I hope that the family gets to read all of the things that we say to them and that all the prayers that some of us have put out there for them get to them.
I  was so blessed to have seen y'all and been able to follow y'all my mama also went to be with the Lord in January.
What the hell happened to Ashley’s face?
👏🏻👏🏻🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏👍💕
Glad the sisters are there for each other and Naomi’s husband who will help them celebrate her life.
Wow is all I can muster!! The faith and strength of these 2 beautiful ladies truly amazing the way they honored their mother!! No more sorrow and no more pain Naomi rest with the Angels beautiful!! God Bless you Ashley, Wynonna & Larry may God continue to give you all the strength and comfort you need in this agonizing time!! 🙏☝🙏💔 #mentalhealthawareness
Your momma Was a strong women , there fore she made y’all strong with the help of God and the angels she forever with y’all you three are beautiful sending deepest love and sympathy and prayers she was gorgeous inside and out 😢❤️🙏🏻🌹🎼😇
I can't believe that their mother is gone I loved them. R.I.P. Mama Judd
So proud of them.  Their Mama was right there with them.
I have listened and sang your songs when y'all first came out I have loved your music and stories I think two of my favorites was love can build and bridge and rocken with the rhythm of the rain ... rest in peace  Naomi 🙏 prayers for the family  God is with you. Big hugs
Prayers
My heart is hurting and is heavy with sadness , Naomi was a sweet and beautiful woman with a beautiful voice . May God bless you and your family . R.I.P. Naomi , you are with God in heaven now . 😭
may the Lord bring Comfort to the beautiful ladies🙏😢
A heartbreaking time. My thoughts and prayers are with y'all. The world has lost a great one. Sending love ❤️
Amen !!! Rest In Peace Queen Judd!
Wynona and Ashley may God bless and comfort you during this difficult time.
Naomi had a pure spirit and a voice that could be likened to a choir of angels. I know she is seated at the table of the LORD. I Love you Naomi Judd. God bless you, Louise
God loves you all and I do too..
By reading a lot of the comments it obvious you people don't know anything about heaven or hell. People think they can live anyway they want and they'll go to heaven. People think you can take your own life like she did and you will make it to heaven. She is most definitely burning in hell for it.
Condolences, Prayers and Hugs for the family  from Tennessee..
So sorry for the loss
Love has built a bridge.. between here and heaven....she'll be with everyone always ❤️‍🩹🙏 rest in peace and hugs
I am so very sorry for your loss! You are both so very strong! May the lord place his gentle hand upon your entire family. I lost my mother in 2017 I know how difficult it is to lose your mother but just know she is always with you.  She is your Gaurdian Angel 😇 God Bless You and your family.
To all the women who looked up to Naomi has a warm , kind, gratitude heart and her daughter Wynonna will have to take her daughter Grace to a new level . Naomi did her work and now it's time. Good luck to this family. 🎼♥️🕯️🙏🤗
As Dennis Miller once said,, “nice set of Judds” great group, wonderful music.
❤
heal thy self, do not wallow.  Move on and appreciate your life!
Unfortunately, when some people have severe depression, not even fame, money, siblings, parents, friends, children, grandchildren nor a spouse, can make people realize how special & needed they are, R.I.P. Naomi.
We love you all as I feel your love back!
So good for Wynonna!  Love the humor with the pain. Ashley looks a lot like Naomi. They have each other to walk through this difficult time. ❤
Love love love ALL you Wonderful Talented Strong Christian Judd women ❤💔🙏  May Momma Judd RIP 💔 ❤ 🙏 So Very Sorry for Your Loss.... 🙏
People need to know that a SYMPTOM of mental illness is suicide. It's a fact. It is a VERY dangerous disease and you can talk all day long to a person but if they are not in a good state of mind, sometimes psychotic and they ONLY need the right meds, plain and simple. It has nothing to do with anyone else, it is their mind malfunctioning. So if they are misdiagnosed by a Psychiatrist, they could easily harm themselves. It's very important to listen to family because they see what is going on. Get help and Dr.s, LISTEN to the family!
As I sit here watch Wynonna and Ashley speak about there momma,I can't help but not start crying for them. I loved the judds and grew up listening to them. My prayers are with you too daughters.
I'm sad for your loss.
My most favorite duet ever my gosh so sad
RIP Naomi Judd. Wynonna, Ashley, and all that loved her I am so sorry for your loss.
She will be. Missed  Naomi  she was a great   person and she was huge  in country music.  Well. Derisived. Rip. Naomi you. Will be. Missed
Wynonna,  you are the BOMB!
Ashley looked so calm and at peace saying the lords prayer. There's a lot  of strength in that prayer when you believe. It brings on color the older you get.
I lost it when Winona began to recite the Lord’s Prayer…..it felt as though I was grieving their loss  with them, and every ounce of sorrow of m6 own life………..powerful!   Thank you for the hope found in the lines of Scripture!
My thoughts are with you all hugs.
Loved we all loved you so much xoxo
😭
😭
My mother died 8-18-2002, on my youngest daughters birthday.  My 3  sisters and I sung at her funeral service.  It was an absolute privilege to sing for her one last time…….
I feel the pain of both of these amazing women, and I admire their strength.  Naomi will always have a special place in my heart because she brought awareness to mental health.  My Momma suffered horribly with depression and anxiety, and she attempted suicide twice.  After all the medication and Electric Shock Therapy, it just destroyed her brain even more and she ended up with Alzheimer’s.  I was heartbroken when she passed, but a part of me felt relief because I didn’t want to see her suffer anymore.  My thoughts and prayers for comfort and peace are with you all during this heartbreaking time.  Big hugs and lots of love. 🙏🏼✝️❤️
Love you all soooooo much , I'm soooooo sorry for your loss.  Stay strong and stay with our lord because she is with him now and still loving you all . Xoxo
Prayers
What a tragedy and great loss. Losing your mother is tough God only can give us strength in Jesus name amen 🙏. Wynonna said the Lord’s Prayer at the end we will dwell in the house of the lord forever I have a new concept to that meaning now. Wynonna & Ashley and the family and friends. Our mothers are in heaven singing praise all day and night. RIP our beautiful mothers.
Oh my word when I was scrolling thru Facebook saturday and saw Naomi had passed I 😥 my 💔 i've followed The Judds since the since 1988 i introduced to them and Randy Travis music fm a former military friend I served with she was fm Beeville, TX  she said i'm going to introduce you to country 🎶 and i want you to introduce me to R&B and Hip Hop we both fell in ❤ with each others genre of music i'll never forget her just like I can't forget Naomi, Wyonna & Ashley my heart breaks for them. Naomi was a Praying Woman, Beautiful, Spunky, Funny etc I take refuge in knowing to being absent from the body is to be present with the Lord she's an 😇 now resting in the arms of JESUS Rest in Paradise Naomi you are and will Forever be Loved 🙏🏽
So sorry for your loss 🥲
Wy, you and Ash are amazingly strong.  Lean on each other and take care of Pop.
Good job acting sad, ASHLEY, the outcast 🙏
Praying for you beautiful sisters and all of of your Mom’s loved ones
My heart goes out to Ashley n Wynonna ❤️
My grandma used to make me read that passage - makes me cry my face off now 🥹 RIP Naomi 🕊
Honestly one of my favorite duo’s with country she will be missed by all by her spirit lives on in both her beautiful daughters and grandchildren we all love u and your daughters
Such a loss.  Three incredible women
Those 2 daughters are just as gorgeous as their mama <3  My heart breaks for them!
Sending SO MUCH L❤️VE too you all!!!. Very much understood. May The Angels hold you under there wings.  Many prayers.
The JUdds treated their venue staff like trash. I hope she's looking up at us with regret.
My defan papa ( my late sainted father) used to go over the lord is my shepherd, line by line with me. As he did I realized what that meant and it was easier to remember. It’s a beautiful prayer and praise to our Lord and his son Jesus Christ. Rest easy with the angels now “Naomi “ Diane Ellen Judd. Your sorrows are gone and you don’t have to cry anymore, you are with the most high and he will comfort you now. Naomi took her name from the Bible and the famous passage of the woman Ruth & Naomi and also they talk of Orpah in that same story who Oprah was named after, but the hospital made a mistake is what I think Oprah said.   Naomi means sweet and pleasant and I think that was a fitting name for her. May she now have peace now and one day be reunited with her daughters, husband and family. May they be comforted during this difficult time and may their health issues be healed. I know Ashly has had a serious injury and has talked about how migraine medication has affected her. So I hope she will be able to be healthy again. I am praying they will cling to those that love them as they get through this difficult time of saying goodbye to their mother. ❤️⭕️❌
Sending prayers
I of course didn't personally know the Judd's but through their music. I felt a connection my heart breaks for her beautiful daughters but I know that Naomi gave them the strength to persevere with God and the love of so many. May Naomi rest in heavenly peace we had an angel among us and God called her home. Love to all their family from Texas.
My heart goes out to the Judd family
Peace
My heart goes out to the Judd family
Sweet lady
Fly high,Naomi.So sorry for your loss,Wynonna and Ashley.😥
God Bless the Judds and family ❤️🙏🏻❤️🙏🏻❤️🙏🏻
Oh, God bless. Reminds me of when I lost my mom. Stay strong and think of happy times of just you and her. It does not get easier you just learn to adapt. Bless you two girls. Much love. ❤️🥰
Heartbreaking 💔💔
Brave and courageous, still one my very favorite country concerts.   Rip and prayers for her husband and daughters.
Strong  beautiful women raised by a strong beautiful woman.
the medication killed her!!  its the same with dementia patients, they are diagnosed placed in care home & in 6 months they are gone. Naomi was so over medicated she was shaking from the affects of it
May she Rest in peace now 😢. prayers to Ashley and Wynonna and their family  during this very sad loss Fly High Mama Judd ❤🕊
You are loved Wynonna and Ashley! 😘
He is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think according to the power at work within us. Ephesians 3:20 What an amazing testimony to His greatness by your presence during this time. May mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to you.
I LIST MY HUSBAND 9 YEARS AGO HE HAD A MASSIVE IT WAS SUDDEN I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TH GRIEF WILL ALWAYS BE THERE AND YOU WILLALWAYS REMEMBER THEM IN ONE IF DOLLYS MIVUES ONE IF THE CHARTCERS SAID " GRIEF IS LOVE THAT HAS NO PLACE TO GO"
Thank you to Naomi, Wynonna and Ashley Judd. You give the world an example of love and strength and hope. You are all legends and beautiful souls. Rest in peace Naomi.❤
Naomi told me I’m Wynonnas father
God bless you ladies and give you his strength.  I always loved hearing you sing.
Thank you for sharing the 23rd psalm.  I didn't see any other site that included the most essential part of the Judds acceptance  speech as they were inducted I to the Country Music Hall of Fame.   God bless Naomi, her family and loved ones.
😌😔🤧🤧
🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹Forever...

Naomi told me I’m Wynonnas father’s
It almost sounds as though Naomi had staged a planned suicide...  which the family had already agreed to....?
💔💔💔
💝💝💝😞🎆
God bless your beautiful family! ❤💔❤
I am so sorry for you ladies. I loved to hear her sing. God be with you both.
Too bad there isn’t a love ❤️ icon instead of a like👍icon.  Smash that love ❤️button!
God Bless these strong daughters beyond words.   Naomi would have been so proud.  I'll miss her so much she was a light in this world.
Praying that Our Lord and Savior give you peace at this difficult time. May you know that your mama is resting comfortably in the loving arms of God. Prayers of peace to you and yours.❤
R.I.P Naomi....I lost my mama Feb 1st and its still really fresh and heartbreaking
Prayers
Sending them all love, light and prayers.
Died from mental illness yet they all stood around her while she died?  How does that work? Was it assisted suicide?
My deepest condolences to Wynonna and Ashley and thier family
Fabulous!🙏
Three beautiful women, and I know how hard it is that you’ve lost your mama🥲 but she would want you girls to go on and be your best and be happy. I just lost my daddy and I know the pain you’re going through I can’t tell you it will go away because it won’t it just gets a little easier but live life to its fullest for your mother and make her proud❤️🙏👍🏻
RIP Naomi.🙏❤😥  God bless Ashley and Wynonna, they are already very strong women. I know that God is watching over them; I know he is blessing these girls with extra strength and comfort during this very sad time. I know Naomi has to be smiling down on them so very proud. My thoughts and prayers are with Ashley Wynonna and Larry. 🙏❤
It's NAOMI, not...NOT...NIOMI.
Thank you sweet Lord for Naomi.
God Bless the Family 🙏🎶
You are great ladies
We are Praying for you 2 sisters and Family we Love You
i don't know why they're being so mysterious about her death. some say it was not suicide and if she did not take her own life, I'd want that to be known about my mother..one way or the other.
Mama Judd, I hope you are at peace with the Lord.
💔💔💔🕊
i am so very sorry for your loss, my heart and prayers go out to you
May you all find peace in the loving arms of our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ!!!♥️
Does anyone have a recording of the Judds on Entertainment Tonight in Feb 1985 (right before the 1984 Grammys)  it was one of those shows where they had celebrities predict who would win Grammys and the Judds were on it does anyone have that?
Prayers for them
So so sorry for your loss …   🌈🙏🏻🙏🏻
Ricky Skaggs is the best!!!♥️
Being mentally is does not kill you. My wife has been mentally ill with bi-polar skitso for 50 years. You don't die for from being mentally ill. You die as the result of being mentally ill, if you commit suicide. They won't tell us what caused her death.
Sorry for your loss may God be with you
This is so heartbreaking & like Wynonna said, such a bittersweet time, losing their mother & having to accept such a tremendous award in her honor. Being another person with depression & anxiety,  I can so relate to Naomi feeling so lost w no way out. I am so sorry she couldn't find her way out of the darkness,  but I know in my heart she is now basking in the bright light of Heaven & proudly watching over her beautiful daughters. My heaet & prayers go out to them, her husband,  friends & fans. Shine bright & fly high Naomi. Love will build a bridge to guide yoyr girls back to you someday.
Y'all are amazing. Don't owe us a thing.🌹🙏
Wynonna has a strong faith. Prayers to both sisters.
Lord, bless these ladies as they mourn the loss of their mother. Be with Larry Strickland and comfort him. Father, hold them closely to You. 🙏🙏🙏
I'm 42 and when I was 5 mom tried to make me sing Mama He's Crazy with her and that's when we discovered I could not and would never understand how harmonising works. That magic we reluctantly had to leave to the Judds.
I saw Naomi and Wynonna sing at Kent Robbin’s Funeral. He wrote the song “Love Is Alive.” He tragically died asleep at the wheel on his way to Gulf Shores, Alabama with his family. My condolences to the Judd Family. I hope Kent was there to greet Naomi at the Heavenly Gates.
My thoughts are with you and so very sorry she will be greatly missed
The girls now need to move forward with assistance to mental health programs throughout the US
Niaomi Judd you was a beautiful woman with a beautiful voice. I pray you are at peace now share your beautiful voice in Heaven in the Angels  choir.
Naomi had a great life.
May God comfort her family and friends as only He can
This was a tear jerker.   My condolences to the Judd sisters and the rest of their family.  Yes, Naomi is now with the Lord and that is such good news!  This was indeed emotional and spiritual, and it is understandable that Wynonna felt both broken and blessed at the same time.  Brokenness can only be part of our earthly realm.  Can you imagine what it must be like to meet the Lord?  Pure elation...  a true blessing.
Some here make mention of not knowing this , mom and daughter duo. A rags to riches story and all the inbetween problems that families have. BUT, no others are more talented or loved like these two ladies were, and are. Can't say enough about um. Will miss Naomi, but she made her mark on history. She won't be forgotten.  Its not what you take Naomi, but what you leave behind you.  And you have left us with your precious talented Wynonna. The race is run and won. You are laying in the arms of Jesus now.  RIP sweet lady!
I have always been a fan of all three of the Judd's. But when it comes to Naomi... I crushed on her from the first time I saw her. That smile of hers always took me to my knees. She was so beautiful and oh so personable. It's hard to believe she is gone. Ashley and Wynonna are always in my prayers. I personally like you both but I'm sorry you don't hold a candle to the beauty of Naomi. I mean no disrespect... I just had a lot of love for her, as I know you did as well. You are her daughters... I'm just a fan. Good bye Naomi the world will miss you, none more than I. 😭😭😭😭😭😭🤟🤟❤️❤️🥺🥺
…and I WILL dwell in the house of the Lord FOREVER!   Not many people can say that … with that much Blessed Assurance … where does their strength come from? From the fact they personally KNOW Jesus as their Lord and Savior
A PERFECT EXAMPLE of how to act the day after your Mother passes away from this life. So inspiring. I can FEEL the Holy Spirit from that MOMENT today through the computer. 🙏✝️
My dear God how incomprehensible that one day we are here .. and then .. GONE … May Naomi fly on angel wings for her pain that took her is now filled with peace
So much plastic surgery I didn't know who was who
My thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends, RIP Sweet Naomi
You are 2  very strong women.. May God bless you and keep you
God bless you!  Very powerful your prayer!! ❤❤❤
This is a hard to swallow,disbilief shock such strong woman beleaved in God.RIP you' ll be looking down on us and new rising,Thank You for your music never to be replaced.Condolences to family,you are 2 strong young woman Thank You.
Well done ladies 😇💞
So much love
I'm bawling like a baby right now after hearing Wynonna and the sweet words she spoke. I've been a huge fan of the judds since i was a teenage girl. I'm 44 now and i have a mental illness and i know how hard life can be as I'm struggling each and every day to wake up to face another day. There are days when i just want to give up. I have no family no friends the only one i have who cares is god. He's been with me through alot of hard times and he's with me now as i sit here and mourn the loss of such a beautiful and kind woman. Naomi will be missed and she will be in all our hearts forever. Rest with the angels💕💕 my condolences to Wynonna ashley judd and their family and friends. I'm sitting here listening to love can build a bridge and crying. We will never forget naomi for she was and always will be one of my favorites in country music. The song grandpa was played after i lost my grandpa over 20 years ago. It was one of his fav songs by them. And i sang it at his funeral for he always said what a beautiful voice i had and my grandma wanted me to sing it for him. He passed away before i got the chance to say goodbye. I rushed to the hospital when they said he's not gonna make it mucb longer so if you want to say goodbye you should come now. My friend sped to the hospital but it was too late he passed just 2 mins before i got there i was so sad that i didn't get to say goodbye and tell him how much i loved him. Same with my grandma she passed 2 yrs ago and her fav song was the baby by blake shelton so i sang it for her while i cried. She also loved the judds alan jackson and george straight. I love her and miss her so much. I'll always remember when my grandparents took me in we would always have cmt on singing and dancing to every song we heard. When love can build a bridge came on i would sing it and after wards my grandma would always say your gonna make it in country music someday i just know it. But due to mental illness and other things that happened in my life that dream never came true. Sorry for rambling I'll end it here by saying rip to the wonderful beautiful naomi judd she may be gone but she will never ever be forgotten💕💕💕💕
just few days ago I sent my sister a blanket with the 23rd Psalm on it! My mother had died giving birth to my middle sister; she heard this verse as her spirit left her body.  However, God had other plans; my mom gave birth to me a year and  a half later. Lived an additional 51 years.
Ashley I love watching you on tv
Those girls did their mama proud.
Tears!!!!! 🙏🏽🕊
I am praying for you lady's and your family she was a beautiful lady and will be really missed that for sure god bless you all God is with you and he will help you thought all this he will show you the way lady's I am praying for you 😇🎵🎶🙏❤️💐🌹
Rip Naomi. You were a beautiful soul and human being
They loved their mama and it is so inspiring! They are so strong!! Thank you Lord!
I loved loved loved her...oh my goodness.
You’re right. 😭
Your mama was a beautiful lady. So sorry to hear of get mental illness. My grandmother suffered the same. It is an awful suffering. Unending and uncontrollable. Bless you and may she rest at peace.
My heart aches for you ladies and your mom’s hubby
Mental illness is a terrible disease.   I lost a dear friend from it (depression) last fall & now a dear friend's husband is afflicted with dementia.  Prayers for all those affected.
Thank God we have their excellent music...it's timeless!
❤️Ms. Naomi may your soul RIP now❤️🙏🙏🙏
My heart goes out to the girls ...you are all wonderful

My heart goes out to Wynonna Ashley Larry and the rest of the family. God is love God is understanding. God's grace is wonderful.  I want to say I hope it's okay to mention that I struggle everyday with mental illness. I Praise God for giving me each everyday of my life. I know God's love will carry the family through this. The music that was shared and performed by mom and daughter will always be here and be the greatest strength help carry on. So again my heart and prayers go out to the whole family  and the friends.
Fly with the angels Naomi.  The Judds remain lifted in my prayers.
The Judds! Great country music singers and of the great female American Families! I always enjoyed Naomi's books. She helped me get through alot with her wisdom!

Their strength do not amazing me.. because they were raised by a strong woman.. r.i.p., my friend r,i,p
It saddens me that Naomi suffered so much with mental illness. Sometimes with illness no matter what we do it won't be enough. Although she has left a huge void I don't judge her for taking it into her own hands to put an end to her suffering.
I am so sorry that Naomi passed away and I am here for you guys too
Strong women
Such a great family.  So faithful and talented.
Such strong, beautiful women.
I know she will be greatly missed. I read a story in a Christian magazine about their life and how they started out. Naomi was a nurse before they started singing. I remember some of the stories, after their father left Wynonna started with her guitar & Ashlee wanted to help so she started acting at a very young age. Most people may know the story of how they started out. I was moved that the family really stuck together to get thru a hard time. They made it big & I love their music, & I love Ashlee she is a good actress. I hope God blesses them thru-out this hard time now and wraps his arms around them as they move forward to get thru this heartache.🙏🙏🙏♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
I'm sickened that this organization chose not to post-phone this event untill the family has had time to grieve!!! What a bunch of bloodhounds!!
May Jesus sit with you in the ashes of your sorroe
Pretty ridiculous how everyone is boo hooing over her!!! What about thousands of unborn babies being killed everyday!!! Makes me sick!!!🤮🤮🤮
My sincerest thanks for your beautiful posting of this lovely woman and her incredible daughters. May she rest in much well-deserved harmony and peace... 🙏 😇💖
RIP Naomi. Praying for both of you, Wynonna and Ashley. 🙏🙏Dwell Forever. 💔
I’m so proud of these women and I know Naomi will always be looking after her family 💝💝
Rest in peace Naomi Judd you will be missed but never forgotten God bless the family Wynonna and Ashley God give them strength to continue wynonna spinal speech The Lord's prayer brought tears to my eyes but I know Naomi is looking down from heaven singing with the angels and blessing us AMEN 🙏🤗 THANK YOU NAOMI FOR THE WONDERFUL YEARS OF MUSIC thank you to THE JUDDS  you turn me on to a different style of music they open my eyes and ears to country music  thank you to such beautiful music that my eyes and ears and heart were close to listen to and thanks to them I know enjoy country music🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
Naomi is a Legend. She will never be forgotten. Prayers to her beloved family 🙏
They're implying she took her life.  If that's the case this is even more tragic. She was so beautiful and glamorous, it's hard to imagine she suffered from depression, but I realize that depression can affect anyone, no matter how well off they appear. to be.
I met your mom during a book signing in a book store outside of Boston, MA some years ago.  She was the kindest, most cordial women that evening, as tired as she was, she never faltered with a smile, a kind word, and left me an impression that I will never forget.   She was a beautiful lady.  My heart breaks for you on the loss of your mom.
I am so inspired by these beautiful daughters to show up for their mothers (an Wy's)  richly deserved and long overdue induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame.  It is a selfless and beautiful tribute to an amazing woman and their fans.  RIP Naomi.
Amen.
Thank you Naomi for all of the joy and the good music you brought to us and thank you Wynonna and Ashley for sharing with all of us so soon. You are so loved by so many as your mama is and always will be
My heart is breaking!  Love and prayers to you Wynonna, Ashley and Larry!  Naomi, you were so loved and will never be forgotten.  RIH beautiful lady.
Taste Country you are selfish, instead of focusing to Naomi on this video, you are inserting your desire for more subscribers and followers for your personal consumption
My condolences to Wynnona Ashley and Larry.
Mental illness is a horrible disease and peoples beliefs in a supposed god might give them some solace....My question is why would a supposed loving god put people through horrific mental health diseases beyond their control.....That is sadistic.
That verse is on my mothers head stone. 🥲
I pray as their hearts are breaking, that they draw near to the Lord, as He gathers them under His wings, as a mother hen gathers her chicks.  Holy Spirit comfort this family.
Sorry to hear this. Had she been sick because it’s hard to tell what happened. I feel sorry for her family. So hard to lose someone that you love.
So sorry for the loss of
My deepest deepest condolences and deep prayers to her daughters, family ,friends and fans. These women are so strong and courageous. She will be truely missed.❤️🙏
And AMAIN 👏🏽❣️🌹
Not a fan of their music but as a human being it’s sad to lose your mother because she’s the only one that is her children #1 fan.  When she started saying what they did last together is when I cried. She’s n the house of our lord & will be well again. Rip.
I’m not a huge country music fan, but I know what it’s like to not have your mother with you. Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of His might! Just as God will always be with you, Momma Naomi will always be with you! Rely on God’s goodness, faithfulness, and grace to get you thru these next days, months, and years ❤️😔
My condolences to the Judd family.
😢 we feel your pain. May the Holy Spirit be with you, for there is no better comfort, than He. God bless you and Amen.
I miss Naomi That was intense
All my Sympathy to You in the Loss of your Dear Mother & to all the Family. Naomi RIP 🙏
This got me 💔
I had the great privilege to see the Judds in concert back in the day, and got to meet Winona after the show. She was so kind. Prayers sent for Winona, Ashley and all of their family and friends.
God bless the daughters......
Prayers for strength,and healing.
My sympathies to all
r.i.p love all your songs it broke my heart when I hurt the very sad news 😢😢
Our trophies and crowns, our achievements and awards, our successes and failures, our accomplishments and certificates mean absolutely nothing after we die.
She was talented and beautiful human. Rest in peace sweet angel.
Sadly, her selfish act of committing SUICIDE NEGATES her testimony written inside her book because she succumbed to Mental Illness.     She DID NOT fight it and WIN like she led everyone believed that she DID! She fought it and LOST the BATTLE... I say the ending of her book needs to be rewritten because it's all BS at the very END!!
Prayers to Wynonna, Ashley and Larry and all her friends. God Bless you all,
❤
So I guess the whole family knew she was about to comitt suisde?!?
What the hell did Ashley go to her face? She was so pretty and now she looks like an alien.
I Love  what Carrie Underwood said, " Sing with the Angels Naomi ! I bet she will be!
WOW! The ultimate narcissist that Naomi's true self has revealed...never wanted to be outshine by anyone else so knowing this night included the recognition of several others Naomi made sure to commit suicide so the entire night would be about HER and no one ELSE. The ultimate narcissist wouldn't you say?
The momma was great, will miss her. But that youngest daughter....she's a "naaasty woman."
Their lives are a testament to dysfunctional families that can survive and thrive.  They definitely learned how to make lemonade out of lemons.  Yes they were very Blessed but I think they all struggled with depression and mental health issues but they never hid it they put it on the front porch as a true southerner should and others benefited from their heartfelt honestly.
RIP Naomi🥀you will be missed. GOD bless her daughters and family and all her love ones 🙏 sorry for your loss 😞
Loved the Judd's. 'God Rest You On That Mountain', Sweet Naomi.🎶✝️☮️
Since it has not been directly stated, it is unknown whether Naomi was deathly ill physically or whether she took her own life. If it was the latter, I am sorry that the lure of peace cloaked in death was her last belief. But, please, if it was suicide, let's not mythologize it as a sweet end because it is not. Life can be hard and depression is real and I know what it's like to be in so much pain that taking another breath seemed not worth the effort. I've held on to my Faith and it is heartbreaking to think that this precious soul may have believed that it was easier to let go. Prayers lifted UP for the loved ones Miss Naomi left behind🙏
We loved your mama!!!!
Wynonna and Ashley, I’m so very sorry that you both have lost your mother. Thank you both for the beautiful music and great memories. You and Ashley will be in my prayer. GOD bless.
Rest In Peace Sweet Naomi, God bless and keep your family on Earth!! You were dearly loved by The masses!! You will be missed 💕🥰😘
These women are the definition of strength. I have always admired them so much, and I hope God gives them comfort after this terrible loss.
No more suffering..she is now at Peace...we have no clue what she went through
I’m sure it took so much strength & courage to show up then for that oh so hurt woman to choose to lighten the room with a joke speaks so much of her character. They were so deserving of this award!! I know she’s looking down smiling as she finally gets to feel the peace she wanted.
God bless...RIP Naomi
So sorry for their loss , their momma would've been so proud of them excepting that award. Wynn and Ashley keep your heads up. Know that beautiful angel your mom is now singing in heaven.
So sorry for your loss.  R.I.P. Naomi Judd 🙏
Sending my deepest condolences to Ashley and Wynonna for the loss of their beautiful Mother, Naomi Judd.  She certainly brought so much happiness, faith, love and peace to this world. She will be dearly missed by all.
R. I. P Naomi fly high sing with the angels
Amen Wynonna
Her daughters are her greatest legacy of love, strength and goodness.
Why did it take so long
I went to their concert and love all three Lady's. I know what Naomi went through love you beautiful Lady. So sorry Wynonna and Ashley
All I can think is she did it her way. She made a great life for herself and her daughters. She saw her way through hepatitis C against all odds. Before and during all of it, she brought much love, pleasure, happiness and joy to many people throughout her music career. At age seventy six and with a lot to be proud of behind her, she chose her time to cross over to the other side. She is in the divine and has peace of heart because she's far removed from this world of hurt. Love & healing sent out to her family and friends as well as her dedicated fans. It's not goodbye, it's only a rearrangement of the soul's position within this great massive Universe.
To Wynonna and Ashley, your Mama was a blessing to all of us.  Her humor at the shows was precious.  Her laughter was like music to the ears.  I know she faced terrible memories, things that haunted her.  For that, I am so sorry.  It hurts knowing she hurt so much. I will keep your family in my prayers.  She is in the house of the Lord, forever, amen.
kudos to The Taste of Country for airing these
Dear God how sad
Amen!!!
There are no words that can be said Wynonna said it all.
I felt the depth of Wynonna's words and how she meant what she said.  Truly remarkable!  A very hard day!
I am truly sorry for your loss of your mother and county music will not be the same.
WHERE DID NAOMI JUDD DESCRIBES HER MOTHERS LAST DAY
I rarely even listen to country music. But definitely admired this family.
My heart breaks for them 💔 😢
My prayers are with the girls and family.
To be honest we don’t need to know the cause but of course people wanna draw their own conclusions
We are heartbroken over the loss of your mother. We loved your music, from your fans here in canada. May your mother rest in peace
Prayers for the family loved her
Your gorgeous mom was so loved. God bless and keep you…
This is so sad to hear.  Love these ladies!  Rest in Peace and Love.
I literally got shivers. Omg !
Naomi did what she thought was best. In my opinion it was a BIG mistake but depression makes you see no hope at all.  She took her life because she thought it was the only way out.  I just wish this family would be HONEST and say what really happened.  Naomi called her fans her family.  If we're family, we deserve to hear it said.
Poorly done, not subscribing!
Feel for these 2 ladies. Having a family member with depression affects a whole family. Heartbreaking.
The following was my 39 second one and one with her:  I had the pleasure of meeting her in 1990 in St John's , Newfoundland. I just checked in the hotel, talking on the phone to my staff organizing dinner. A light tap on my shoulder made me turned my head around and there she was, a soft voice " How r you doing Mr. ? ". a stunning beauty she was. My heart raced  . I nodded speechless, Her daughter came by and they both disappeared into the elevator. I shall treasure that encounter all my life. RIP.
We loved them like they were family..We still do..Momma Judd is the wind beneath their wings..Hold on to your faith and each other..you will make it!!!
🙏😔
Well done, Wynonna ❤️. And Ashley.

PRAISE OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST 🙏🙏🙏 WE WILL SEE YOU ALL IN HEAVEN
So inspiring to hear words of the Lord spoken by celebrities!! Congratulations on induction & thank you beautiful Naomi for the music!
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 prayers to the Judds
God bless you Wynona for sharing those final moments with us and using your time to recite the 23rd Psalm. I read Psalm 103 to my mother as she was lying in bed at a hospice house. I felt her let go of whatever she was hanging on to. Nothing like the word of God to remind us that He is bigger than us and He’s got this. Look forward to seeing my mother again in a perfected state and reflecting the glory of her Savior.   (Edit:  corrected a spelling error)
That prayer is how most our goodbyes are with all who know christ
My deepest condolences 🙏 ❤
R.I.P. 🌈 Naomi 💕
Ashley has had too much plastic surgery to her face.  She looks terrible.
Rest on High Naomi Judd sending your family my prayers and love to help your beautiful family endure the loss of their Mother, Best Friend and Strength that glued them together 😇❤️
Your Mom was your Mom, she was everything  to you both as well as you were to her..
Mama was crazy indeed.
She Finally has the joy and peace she longed for and gave to her family and fans through her music.
This is so tragic...RIP Naomi...💔...
God's peace be unto you all, the Judd's and her fans and all of Country Music and Nashville.
God Bless these sweet girls and give them strength They are so stronge to honor their mother ❤
So very sorry for the loss of your precious mom.  May God comfort and keep you both.🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Sorry for your loss she will be missed
Ashley and Wynona, your Mom was the bright star for many here on earth and she will ALWAYS be amongst the brightest stars in the heavens for all of us. I share your grief and pain as I lost my mother and father when they were far too young. I wish I could say the heart heals, but it doesn't. There will always be that part that never stops hurting and breaking. But it does hurt less. Your Mama is happier now and she will always be with you.  I love both you ladies. You're stronger than the pain. You're stronger than this loss. PLEASE focus on honoring your mom and her life through your songs, stories and art. There is no better gift.
Our prayers are with u all !!! She was so beautiful & she had a beautiful voice. GOD Bless  her soul.
I’m so sorry!❤️🙏
So she did help herself leave
My Condolences 💐 To U All, And Especially U Two Sisters 👯‍♀️!!!! RIP!!!!!

My heartfelt condolences to Wynonna and Ashley on the loss of your mother her legacy will live on in her many adoring fans. The Lord is my Shepherd I shall not want for nothing!
The song Love can build a bridge is so beautiful I only wish people today could break down walls and build that bridge to forgiveness instead of anger and hate ...💔💔
Deepest condolences to family and friends of Noami Judd God Bless y'all 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
God bless these two wonderful women. May the love their momma had for them and their faith carry them through. 🙏🏽
What a beautiful soul. A soul that is shared by all three women and how blessed  we are to be in their presence.
“Ashley”doesn’t like like “Ashley”anymore… please no more plastic surgery
🙏🙏🙏🙏
I played a couple Judds songs on a bar and grill  juke box Friday evening.  It just seemed appropriate. Country music lost an icon that day.
Loved your muchSo much RIP god be with you.

What an amazing Lady, I’m glad I was able to see them.  You could tell Naomi was so “Genuine “.  No more pain,  be at peace Naomi ❤️🙏🏻…
My heart is broken.  I just watched a video when she had to stop being on tour, she said the phone never rang.  I was so sad.  If I knew her number I would call her everyday.  Rest in peace.

Praying foe Wynonna and Ashley and asking for some peace through this grieving process!
Wynonna's joke cut the tension in the room. But her final prayer ... 😭
We love you and you're in our prayers. Grace that came only from God! The perfect verse, Psalms 23. Bless you Wynonna and Ashley!
God bless Naomi Judd her daughters and rest of family when you say somebody dies of mental illness it's not just mental illness from depression and anxiety that causes it suicide is what causes it it can be very hard to deal with these things one would expect somebody with such a tremendous life would never ever have depression or anxiety but I'm totally wrong you can why they do I don't know all I know is it's a sad situation that so many people take their lives by myself like I said suffer from depression and anxiety I thought of it but my religion says don't do it so I can't I have to suffer through the life that I have been given and my sons have been given and we pray for everybody with any kind of illness for their safety and God's blessings Naomi we will miss you
So sorry for the lost of your beautiful mother.i will miss her so much
How strong & beautiful were Wynonna & Ashley. Two remarkable daughters from a stunning woman, Naomi. She will never be forgotten & beyond forever will she be loved. Your star now shines bright in the heavens, Rest In Peace, Naomi. ♥️🙏
I made my First Husband fall in love with me by singing Momma He's Crazy so I love you all Judd's. They'll never be a more cherished memory I have Girls so We join in  and send this great Sparrow on to the heavens above. I love you Naomi!!
the world has lost a gentle soul, GOD BLESS YOU
I couldn’t of shown up.
My prayers are coming your way, Ashley and Wynonna. RIP Naomi! Love you
Ashley has ruined her face. Those big cheeks look terrible
EVERYONE HAS TO K.N.O.W, that this incredibly,  BEAUTIFUL, amazingly TALETED Woman was TRULY Amazing.  She was one of the Most gentle, get STRONG, Kind and loving person that has EVER LIVED!  I can't tell you what a true TREASURE, the world has LOST.  I want the family to know, that I share their lost, that my prays are with them and for them.  And how much I DEEPLY appreciate the love, that she shared with ALL of us.  Wy, my DEEPEST Sympathy to you and your family.
Beautiful lady…thank you Wynonna & Ashley…we’ll done 🌹❤️🙏
I will think of all the good that will come from unfortunate pain suffered by these 3 beautiful ladies. Having the courage to rise above the stigma of abuse and mental illness and share their stories gives others the strength and power to do the same and know that they can admit it out loud and that's OK to do so and seek help!!!! I struggled myself for most of my 50 years with it and in the past 10 years I was able to speak about it without feeling ashamed that is an empowering feeling. Thank you girls and your momma for helping to free so many of us from the stigma and allow us to be able to know it's not our fault and it's OK to seek help! That is the Legacy that I will cherish. All my love, sympathy and gratitude to all your family. Lastly Ashley, I completely agree with you about the power of an animals love and healing powers! Love Lori
I'm glad I work from home and can openly weep. Dear Wynonna, Ashley, Larry, Uncle Mark....I send you my love and sympathy. A beautiful soul has entered the Kingdom of Heaven.
STAY STRONG, YOU HAVE BEEN BLESSED WITH SUCH A SPECIAL MOTHER. NO WORDS TO CONTAIN THIS MOMENT.
Love and prayers for them..
This is really strange I started watching the  Naomi and Wynonnas docuseries on April 28th I don't what made me pull them up and started watching all of them and I pulled up the original video of "Love can build a bridge" watched it a couple times then low and behold I seen something that said Naomi Judd passed away at age 76 made me so mad I said to myself now why are they pulling  this crap of the death hoax on Naomi? I went to Google expecting it to say that it was a hoax and it wasn't it literally broke my heart to see this! Wynonna and Ashley you are in my thoughts and Prayers as is the rest of Naomi's family and friends. Go rest high on that mountain Naomi sing with all the angels walk with Jesus on that beautiful golden road in Heaven! You deserve it, you no longer have to worry about what happened to you as a child or the struggles you had to go thru to get you, Wynonna and Ashley to a good and comfortable place in life and you no longer have to worry about any mental Illness or any medications making your hands shake, you can Rest now in the Peace that you deserve! You will be missed by so many but you will never be forgotten!! ❤❤❤
My prayers go out to Wynonna, Ashley, Larry......my prayers go out to the Nashville Family....but mostly, my prayers go out to each & every person who feels trapped in that "dark place". Reach out for help, life is worth living....there are people who love you but are unaware of how lost you feel. You do not have to suffer in silence! Reach out for help ......we have lost too many desperate souls suffering in silence!  The Judd's have touched every single person who has ever heard their music. From Grandpa....on down to Love Can Build A Bridge.....every person could relate. You have left an everlasting impact on Country Music & I personnally thank you & grieve with you. May God continue to bless all of you!
My heart breaks for the loss of Naomi and the both of you. But praise the LORD today she is in paradise with Jesus. Prayers for peace and comfort.
Prayers for healing.   My mama passed 11/08/21 at the same age 76; hard to swallow, for certain. Naomi was wobderful/talented!! Carry on daughters ☆☆☆☆☆
IM VERY SORRY FOR YOUR LOST 😞 PRAYERS FOR YOU AND THE FAMILY 🙏😭😭😭 LOVE YALL ❤️❤️❤️❤️
so very sorry❤️
Amazing Women!♡ xoxox ♡
My Mom loved Naomi and I lost my Mom almost 3 years ago. When those 2 bump into each other my my. Mom had the same wit, fire, and a beautiful singing voice maybe Mom will talk her into singing background for her or vice versa. To know Naomi is to LOVE HER. WYNONNA AND ASHLEY MY PRAYERS AND THOUGHTS ARE WITH YOU. I tried reaching out to y'all when my Mom passed. Love Can Build A Bridge.
So heartbreaking.  Praying for you and Ashley.  It was such a Blessing from the Lord for you and your Mom to sing Love Can Build a Bridge on the CMT’s.  I believe that song is so prophetic for the time we are in.  🙌🙌
I was actually not at all familiar with the Judd’s music nor their rags-to-riches story and Naomi’s forced early retirement story until last night. To see Wynonna accept this award one day after her mother’s death and Wynonna and Ashley’s grief and their faith—it’s humbling and heart-wrenching.
Sending loves to Wyona and Ashley so sorry for your loss my condolences and sympathies sending love hugs and prayers your way may your mother forever rest in peace with the angels we will truly miss you Naomi we love you
♾ so sorry for your loss time will help heal your pain 🙏✝️🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹♾
What a tragic loss. My heart goes out to her family. RIP Naomi.
I am so sorry that you lost your Mother. God bless you all. I feel for you.
May God bless you both & keep you in the palm of his hand going forward.
My heart aches for them all. RIP Naomi  you will be missed greatly.
So many broken hearts! God bless this family. RIP. Never forgotten - forever loved.💔
