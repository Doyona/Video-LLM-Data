IM 7 dunking from half 😎
Sandwer
Stop with this.
No way, Sandler is goated dude😂😂😂
imagine playing 2v2s and Kevin Garnett shows up
I meet Adam Sandler in Angel city games in LA he played basketball with people in wheelchairs 🦼
He also loves baseball and was really good and fun fact he was in the Little League World Sires.⚾️
those shorts😭
My teacher played with Adam Sandler at some gym
That reverse layup looked like it was in slow motion in realtime.
Kg must’ve really liked Adam because he was actually nice to him
In all of Sandler’s movies there is always a hoop
Every person I know that has met Adam Sandler has had nothing but good things to say about him, real genuine guy
Movie was awful !!!
Adam Sandler is one of the top actors and fan boys for someone else also half a billion dollar worth man he is still more humble then all these ppl getting a 1k pay check on friday
Am I the only one that recognized the name from juice world lol
Too easy
Too easy
can’t do comedy but basketball maybe
Lakers tripping https://youtu.be/bC1ILD02YC0
I worked as an extra on the set a pixel in Toronto he did the same thing here she got the whole Scotia Bank Arena to himself to play basketball with friends
Is this dar man
Baby Adam Sandler are u mad at me baby
Am I the only one that notices young NLE Choppa In the white muscle shirt?😂
Uncut gems was so trash and the music they had for it
Who is Kevin Garnett
Best actor ever
A white boy that can hoop
Truth tho Adam Sandler is a real one. He always protects his friends and make sure they have work.
The dude on the far left looks like a spongebob Popsicle
literally right after watching this video I went and watched the movie and it is honestly one of the best movies I've seen in a long time
Damn! Those highlights are good💯🏀
Remember that Adam Sandler Christmas movie? This is  in real life
This seems like something Adam Sandler would do

Set of Uncut GEMS, played with Kevin GARNETT
Repeat and believe the gospel. Jesus loves you!
I thought he was talking about the other Kevin
Cool story of a what if
Adam Sandler is amazing and is my hero  I want to be like him
Who’s Adam sandwler? Lol
Met him at YMCA on the basketball court in 2016. Very nice but competitive guy
Adam Sandler DEFINITELY did not forget where he came from!
Love Adam Sandler
It’s Adam Sandler who would say no
Cool story-source:trust me bro.
He has money but his body is disgusting... I know you're free to do whatever you want but Imagine if he looked at his best with what the universe gave him? But nah let me look disgusting and hoop. He looks like a pack of cottage cheese in the process of decomposition
Sandler aint the type to wear those skinny jeans kids rock these days 👍
I still love it when in Happy Gilmore Bob Barker beat up Sandler!
The reason why Adam Sandler is one of my favourite actors is for 3 reasons 1 he didn't let money change him 2 he still dresses like, the average person even though he can afford the richest brands 3 he never forgot his friends he always included them in his movies and they're famous too
adam is so wholesome istg
adam sandler looks and acts like my 6th grade social studies teacher
True legend
Looks pretty good, especially for his age. But he did carry on the baseline drive.
We all braggin about who got this and that on tha court and one guy say i own a house tha size of your highschool 🤦🏿‍♂️😂😂😂 i love adam acts like a normal person wherever he goes u never kno its him not at all
Then they made a movie together
That movie F sucked
Bro dressed for basketball, not for the Oscar's
It’s like he doesn’t know he’s Adam Sandler… of course KG is gonna show up😂
These tik tok videos are so whack hahaha mofos act like their new scientist telling us these facts 😂🎬🇺🇸🔥
Uncut Gems is one of the better movies I’ve seen in the past year. Phenomenal acting by Sandler.
All that money and he cant afford clothes that actually fit
This is why it’s a shame Sandler isn’t in the new Space Jam. He could’ve been the new Bill Murray.
Well, at least he found something he can be good at
Adam is the guy who shows to an interview in pajamas.
Is it me or this narrator just say adam sandmler
Yes adam dress like that bc he doesnt like to she that hes rich
Adam Sandler can ball dude. I’m not saying he’s the best or he’s got super moves or anything but he can definitely play ball. He’s pretty good too.
I love Adam Sandler...I can already see him passively aggressively saying "lemme call my friend Kevin"
Bruh Sandler can hoop a bit I seen that dime pass
Clippers
Imagine Adam was going to play on the la
Ain’t nobody playin D on him!! 😂😂😂 prolly had to sign a waiver before the pickup game
Im a fan of him he is at elmo ;^;
It'd cool that he's  from the same neighborhood in Brooklyn that my family and I are from
"i aint gonna lie, you got me in the first half"
Lightskin pimp
Wholesome
Adam sandler is goat
So he didn’t show up?
I wonder if The Kraft Heinz Company sponsored his apparel 🤭
Adam Sandler is still a legend :]
Every time I see videos of Adam playing, his clothes don’t match in the worst way.
Really tells you about the different characters of Sandler and Garnett. Sandler crouches in the shadows, while Garnett stands in the light.
He may not be that great of an actor, but he sounds like an okay guy, which I always respect in actors.
His pump fake is impeccable 😂
No por nada hizo la película de son como niños :V
Ball
Adam Sandler is one of my favorite celebs bc he is funny and also he doesnt chabge his life and style with all of the money he has.
Sandler still showing off that carry when he dribbles....
Adam is always ready to play pick up basketball
Shoes big ash…
When did mike korzemba switch to tiktok
Sandler put up a net…actually just played basketball at a gym court
He dresses nicer in his roles than in real life
I see my boy let's goo
It was a dream of mine, to maybe, stop by the park and do work 2on2
Met him few times he's a dbag ,his humble look and act is just that he's Dbag if you approach him.
This movie was so trasg anyway
Adam Sandler didn’t let that fame change him, He knows he bleeds just like us💯
I just watched the movie uncut gems like 5 min ago XD
Jews like basketball
I mean the guy can actually play a little bit. Please, for the love of all, pull that on some poor dudes at the courts and film it.
:,)
Such a baller!
I love how because he's Adam Sandler no ody is t really putting any effort into guarding him
I know this. I worked on set of uncut gems. This was cool till it led to 16-18hr shooting days
That’s why he is worth so much! And it’s not because he is a hobo
The richest poor looking man
Who else was watching Sandler play basketball and not listening to the dude speaking at all
Imagine if Adam sandler wasnt wealthy he probably would be wearing clothes like hes a rich man but really he lives in a shed
So my mom said I should wash my hair   Then I pulled my pants down so I could
I would love to play basketball with Adam Sandler and everytime he makes a throw, he has to insult me from one of his characters 🤣 would be epic.
I swear everytime I see this man playing basketball he's wearing that ketchup & mustard gear 😂
You know you’re rich when you play basketball in retro Jordans
I kind of figured he be hoopin fr, always playing ball in his movies.
Legend
Fun fact, my dad did electrical work in garnetts home in Minnesota. Or what used to be his home. Don't know if he lives there still.
For a sec i thought i was watching dhar mann
Adam Sandler broke the hoop in my home town's public courts while he was filming a movie. It got replaced super quick though I'm not sure if he paid for it or the town did. He also invited every kid in town that wanted to play to join in for a game.
Kevin Garnet isn’t even in this video though so who the fuck cares?
Everyone talking about how he’s dressed..  I’m over here *impressed* at how good he plays
I cant stop pooping!
No one's blocking KG 😂😂😂
Why does this guy sound like Dhar Mann?
A. Sandler.  Create a player on NBA 2K 21
He ain't dressed like a homeless man he has the fit. It's max comfort stat gives him a 10% boost is agility and strength
No one believes this
What a tool
That moment when Adam Sandler has a better jumper than Ben Simmons 🤦🏾‍♂️
Adam Sandler sucks man. I had to stop watching pixels halfway through
There's nothing bad to say about Adam Sandler. He is a 🐐🐐🐐
Tbh if adam sandler gets good and goes to an real nba team i would start looking at nba
Wow cool story bro
I personally find most of Adam's movies really awkward and unfunny but I really respect him since he didn't let money get to his head . He can buy anything he wants but he buys only stuff that he TRULY WANTS and not stupidly expensive stuff because he is rich
Sounds like the premise of a youtube basketball prank video
Hes got the same outfit on from grown ups, real O.G😂😂
all Adam had to do was call him like its damn adam man
Adam sandler gets alot of hate, but he just chilling and dgaf about what he wears yet he has made millions, thats a real one right there
Adam Sandler’s the man
Dude Adam Sandler is built different
It blows my mind how people think because your a actor or celebrity that you CANT do anything else
He was good in 8 crazy nights
Riches broke looking person in history lol. It's not how much you make but how much you keep. He makes alot and definitely keeps alot 😆
he's got game.   I had no idea.
That's what up my boy Adam can hoop....
Adam Sandler actually has the best drip in hollywood
Uncut gems was one of the best movies from the last decade. Everything about it was amazing, but especially the authentic taste of New York. Love Adam Sandler
Uncut gyms was a sick movie. Sad ending.
So did he play with KG are not ?  If you didn’t know Adam Sandler like basketball you haven’t seen many of his movies.  Adam Sandler the 🎥 🐐.
I saw Adam in a movie  called grown ups
Maybe the Lakers can trade Kuzma away and recruit Sandler
Adam Sandler is one of the best actors to live, I dislike all his produced comedies with Kevin and the gang. Punch Drunk Love is one of my favourite romance films
He is my favorite actor
God bless you abundantly everyone, in Jesus’s name Amen!
He ballin
Difference between celebrities and Adam Sandler:  Commoners (Celebrities): Rich, money don’t last  Adam Sandler: I’m Rick james bitch
Can I get an honest review of uncut gems it really does look good 👍
That’s not fair
He’s the white Chris Paul
That was a pretty nice assist
Money never changes this man☺🙂🤗
Kevin garnet? Is he the wish version of Kevin durant?
Adam Sandler
Crazy to see Adam playing basketball with kevo muney
Better than lechina
Uncut gems is such a good movie
No wonder he is always seen in basket ball shorts everywhere
This man is a legend
Adam Sandler shows up at the parks here in Hawaii and plays hoop with the locals from time to time.
He needs to work on that sorry ass pump fake.
He fucked up his last name
Adam Sandler always dress like he ready to ball at any time of the day
My favorite actor right here
He comes to palladium all the time here at NYU
Tmz must’ve hated him, this man has no news to dig
❤️❤️
Good passer but why can't white guys play defense?
Adam Sandler is never dressed for what he's doing
"So is this Kevin guy good?" Yeah ig.
My dads friend is a jewelry seller and he helped Adam on the movie
🔥
Adam Sandler players 90's street ball clothes. When they would do a tournament.
This doesn’t make him love basketball “so much” this makes him wanna shoot hoops with one of the best to do it.
Hi
Anyone know what brand basketball goal it was?
I love how he dresses like a stay a home dad (but like the good kind) lol
Respect Adam for not rubing in the fact that u have money like every one else
Ta ta ta ta today junior!!!
If I was a celebrity I’ll do the same thing going around hooping in random places just to have fun & make other people’s day. Probably pass out a Lil money or shoes take pics etc
😧
Mans can hoop lokey
I'm the biggest Adam Sandler fan. Greatest movies of my childhood.  I'd be great to see him on the JRE someday
Adam Sandler an OG
Wtf
Uncut Gems was great. Everyone go check it out.
He's apparently an asshole and hires people to let him win as well, though that's just a rumor.
The shoes. THE SHOES MY GOD
KG wouldn't risk his career on a pickup gamr...
I do not give a fuck
He got some game on his grip
He has game.🏀👍😳
the way adam dresses proves to y'all that iced out jewelry and designer don't mean sh*t
I’m everywhere
Cool💯
Always admired Adam's fundamentals. He doesnt rely on being flashy with fancy crossovers or spamming contested shots every time he gets the ball. Also gotta admire his humbleness. Mans is worth 420+ Million dollars but dresses and engages in everyday activities like an average joe. Undoubtedly the true embodiment of "make the money....dont let the money make you."
Adams game is the definition of “fundamentals”
Rockin' them shants on the court.
My mom met him when she was still working at a bank and he had multiple accounts with the max you can put it them i think it was 100k
Yea and when he came to southboro MA he 'reserved' a small section of the frickin town which included a school with some of the best public basketball hoops and wouldn't let any of the local kids anywhere near the area the entire 2 weeks they were there filming. Cool to have him in town and all but kinda bullshit of him to prevent the people that live there from using any of those facilities so he could maybe shoot hoops for an hour or 2 in 2 weeks. Not a fan since then. Not to mention his movies suck ass since early 00's
I love hearing loud ass s at the end of a sentence
Adam Sandler loves Israel so much he made a movie about how it genociding Palestinians is ok
Young guy wit the white vest looks like nle choppa
That bullet pass though he's a point god
jus imagine THE adam sandler specifically calling you to come play some 2v2 hoops
Bruuu got a fire jump shot no cap he good
870 COMMENTS LETS GO!!!!!!
Never forget when i learned adam sandler loved basketball. I was watching 8 crazy nights on tv of course the basketball scene was playing,and i looked up "adam sandler playing basketball" and a video was playing on my computer, at The part of 8 crazy nights when he dunks and goes"got a piece!,got a piece'A' mah ASS!" Played..it synced up wit him getting a rebound in the irl video making him look like he said it IRL and i laughed my happy ass off for 20 mins straight🤣🤣🤣
Jesus is the truth…
That’s not Adam
Adam Sandler and his next movie; Click 2: Basketball Boogaloo.
The second one he did a double dribble
Garnett is THE SHIT! I'd love to be a part of that!!
Thats why his movies suck now but he has great jump shot
He’s playing against Memphis rapper Kevo Muney in the video
Why would he put a laundry basket on the set
Grown ups he wasn’t playing with the bank shot
I played with adam sandler before we played 5 on 5 i was in his team and i have to say he plays like a white magic Johnson the only problem with him is his jump he jumps like a kid lol
#Thegoat 🐐
Adam Sandler one of the true ones who wasn't changed by fame or money.
adam sandler came to my town and played basketball at my old high school court it was pretty cool
Is this the same drip from grown ups 1
Adam sandler is one of the coolest celebs out there. He never once let fame get to him and hates being famous maybe, but just loves what he does.
This man better than me lol
Who gives a crap
dude no cap i literally learned the bank shot from him, from the movie grown ups where he was teaching his son the bank shot
Adam playing basket ball is so out of place but comfortable at the same time
that was a dime tho
Ok but that PASS WAS CLEAN 🔥
Not going to lie Adam looks nice out there. I see you sweating legend.
Respect for him 📈📈
look at kevo muney in the bsck 😂😂
Adam Sandler is a weirdo... he calls and asks schools around the area hes filming if he can come play basketball for free... I know cuz he came to mine.
He’s actually really good at basketball
Adam Sandler is the best
Growin up I always knew adam loved basketball,movies like little nicky, grown ups, longest yard, even the cartoon 8 crazy nights, he is shooting hoops, this just confirms it for me
Nice
How weird would that day be. I bet it would teach a lot of valuable lessons too , kicking it with celebrities and doing normal things
Uncut gems was a great movie
Listen to the way this dude says Sandler
PLEASE DON'T IGNORE THIS.Jesus loves you so much, Jesus is coming back very soon. Put your faith and trust in Jesus and His finished work on the cross,make Him Lord of your life and be saved.You may never get another opportunity like this again....
He was reffering to kevin love 🤭
Side 📝 Sandler got that JumpShot!
Bro he literally talking abt basketball Nd I come to the comments Nd see money this money that😂 like get out this nigga pockets nobody cares what he wear if he wanted to buy designer he would if he wanted diamond Chains he would shi he prolly does, istg das all y’all talk about😂
Nobody playing tough D on Sandler cuz they don't wanna be the guy that breaks Billy Madison's nose with an accidental elbow or bodies him too hard while driving to the hoop.
Unnecessary information
Uncut gems was so fire
act broke to stay rich
You like-a da basket ball? 🫑
Sounds like another stupid movie.
This reminds me of his movie grown ups 1 where they play basketball
Hope he plays better than his movies…
I swear he looks so chill
Sad part is his baseball skills are better then hs best movie 🙄
Adam sandler likes basketball and Kevin garnett and garnett would have played with him, wow amazing story. Tik tok is ruining the human race
*every comment* _Aaawhh i like how Adam dresses_  _mean while_ He is wearing shoes worth of 2.000
A damn sandwhich
He stepped out of bounds on that reverse layup
Adam Sandler is the last guy I expected to like basketball. Good on him
The basketball court at Sony studios is called Happy Madison Court.
Still added an obnoxious and unnecessary soundtrack to the clip!  You added voice.
Sandler dresses like a 10 year old kid who wants to show you his frog collection
Adam SanWer
The amount of grammatical errors has me fucking raging
https://youtu.be/UL30iGxcEC4
Will he ever be able to buy good acting skills?
I love how everyone talks about loving being dressed up as a hobo when he is rich .... but if its an actual hobo and homeless people. ye all be like ewww get the fuck away.... please delusions and grandeur types ....spare a tght for the people that have no fucking choice. ...I love that 😁😁 actually sparing a tght ...that is.
Sandler got game boy.. 💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💪
Fun fact: Adam is wearing the same clothes you uses for interviews to play basketball
it keeps you young
So he does like basketball irl, love Grown Up
Fuck, Sandlers a sell out
Jesus loves you repent plz
Hey he's pretty darn good
God loves you, how can i pray for youuu
We just gonna ignore the fact the Kevo Muney is there
wow does he pay those other players to not play defense on him...😅...cause I'll take some of that cash and let him shoot buckets in my face all day...
Ded dis like adam ... U trader
Humble person
Good for him 🙏
Probably 😉
W
Um I didn't see Garnet
I didn’t hear a single word u said I just watched him play
ADAM SANDWER, WOVES BASKETBALL
Easy
Anybody notice kevo muney
“Probably” .. is not I would have
Aww how sweet
Oh let me go buy a basketball and call my friend Kevin  Who cares
Shittok sucks  Btw I'm not related to him
Thiss is hilarious y’all don’t get. It 😂😂
OG 2000’s shorts
You cannot hate this man
Sandler has my style lol except I wear flip flops
Jesus loves you
Rich white guy purchases basketball court with black players included.. White Privilege at its finest
Adam sandwar tf
GOAT…. Still wearing the baggy clothes . Love it
Uncut Gems, one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Like a 2 hour anxiety attack on film. So much yelling and screaming.
So basically KG didn’t show up 😂
Adam Sandler really doesn’t understand the fame & reach that he holds around the world
Of course he loves basketball. He perpetually looks like he's either going to or coming from a basketball game in which he is participating in
I wonder if these guys know that Adam's Net Worth is around $430 MILLION Dollars!!!!  The dude dresses and acts like a typical dude wanting to play hoops....love this guy!
Love that The Sandman looks up to KG like that 😂
Adam is pro i suport him
Wow crazy how I don’t care
Cool.
So basically, he never showed up haha
And still dress like 90s baggy stuff
You can tell he knows how to ball.
Adam Sandler the king of baggy basketball shorts
Im still looking for Kevin Garnett?? 👀
Adam isn't only a white dot in this place but he is also a bumblebee:))))
#AdamSandler is just one of those lovable guys that you can’t do anything but have respect for the man.
Some pour Pope the thinking he mean “Kevin” James 😂
Uncut gems sucked its ending was the worst ive ever seen
Look at kevo muney
He kinda cold doe
Fun fact: Adam Sandler played basketball in high school 💪🏾💯
Now I get why he always dresses like he ready for someone to pick him up for a game at the park
repent and believe in Christ
WOW I certainly do not care one fckn bit.
Daaamn
Uncut gems was such a good movie with a horrible ending, he won the bet but died ( coz he was shot in the head )
He’s worth 420 million and he still dresses normally and goes to public gyms. Legend
I haven't seen Sad boy shoot in over 29 years lol scam
All Jewish guys can really hoop. Lil dickey is cold on the court.
Adam Sandler always has drip
luv that funking movie, uncut 💎gems - "don't do this to me kg.."
So what
It helps that adam is white and apart of the hollywood elites OH and that he lives in New Jersey 😔😔😔Nazi New Jersey naferiuos nazi nj
Them black dudes are sayin damn we better let him score otherwise we ain’t getting paid
Imagine going to your local park to play, only to end up playing 2 on 2 with KG and Adam Sandler
He is still one of the best person to be around
Kevin has friends 🤔 really
Wow he can really play.
Now it’s my dream to play 2 on 2 with Adam Sandler🤩
And the lesson here is that the answer is NO to 100% of the things you don’t ask for!!
Imagine the local oldhead pulling up with kg and giving everybody straight buckets that's a sight to see
Like lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol
It's for fun but noone is going to "really" play him .
But why do i despise basketball so much??
😏👍
i didn't know YT shorts had subtitles untill i came across this vid
We call this sport netball in England and its mainly played by girls and children.
So thats actuly him?
Well isn't that just chummy spending all that money to play a game
I would love to play a game of basketball with Adam Sandler even thought I would get rocked i would love to play a game with my favorite comedian/ actor
Lies but nice try with the cap
Yooooooo
I don't know if any of you watched the movie uncut gems but it was really good
Hé also love helping out israël murderers
Adam Sandler is an older Luca doncic
Huh
One of the most down to earth people you could hope to bump into!!!!  Seriously he's in Keanu Reeves territory!
69k like noice
Look at the drip
Love Adam Sandler. Hes living the life all middle aged white men dream of. Playing basketball and being rich. Mucho respect Mr. Madison-Gilmore
Mane was workin Kevo ahh
Adam is nice on the court
Hes old slow and short I'd shut him down
Uncut gem made me chew my finger nails off. I had to fast forward that movie because it successfully made me feel uncomfortable, let's just say when you make your own bed, you gotta lay in it.
Everyone talking about his fit like you don't wear the same things like 🤔.  Why you coming at him. Money is just a piece of paper with worth.  Let him wear what he wants 😂
i’ve played w him
look at sandler man so inspirational
Adam Sandler stays humble just look at his outfit lol. I love it when paparazzi takes pictures of him and he's dress like his character from Happy Gilmore.
2K gotta add that jumpshot he has 6000% green window
I saw a tiktok with a bunch of kids playing with him :))) he is a cool guy who hasn't been taken out by fame
The guy got game
Who cares? A rich guy got a basketball court set up for himself. So what?
Sandler still dresses like it’s 2000!

at the beginning the skinny dude with the white tank top I thought that was the young Nle choppa
shoes are like a size bigger
Adam Sandler Vs Flight reacts
Adam Sandler is a regular rich dude and I’m a huge fan of his
Adam sandler ballin??????
Basketball is more than a game it’s love
Adam sandler is also vin diesel
Basketball is a joke. Cant believe people even follow this sorry game.
The people would’ve heard “Kevin” and been like “Aw shit Kevin James gunna show up, we are gunna win this easily.” Until Garnett shows up and they freak out
If Adam Sandler said “my friend Kevin coming to ball with us” I’m getting ready to play against Happy Gilmore and the mall cop
I’m here for the KG and Sandler bromance. Their chemistry in Uncut Gems was incredible.
I had a teacher that played a game of basketball with him
Bet he’s had those shorts for over 20 years😅
The ending of the movie is terrible by the way. Otherwise I would have loved it
When can we get an Adam Sandler jumpshot in 2k
Everyone think Adam is dressed down or like a homeless person when in reality he's dressed to ball.
Thanks no life for explaining something obvious af. Great content
Adam Sandler is the🐐
Not sure that's him
Drained that first bucket too! Was 4 years old when happy Gilmore came out and loved him ever since lol
I luv Adam Sandler
Gotta respect the comfort drip
Mans really said Adam sandwer
Jewish kids from New York City and the surrounding areas love basketball lol
Bros set up a whole basketball tryouts for his upcoming movie in Philly like seriously go check it out you can join!
He doesn't know how to pump fake tho , only lift your arms in the air not your head and arms .
If he said what?
Did he say that he put a hoop to shoot with Kevin garnet and then said it was a dream to and then said Kevin said he prob would .... so what was it did he shoot shots with Kevin G or not lol
Sandler really good in basketball 🏀👏
Boi trash af, they letting him get his cause of who he is
I literally played basketball against him 2 days ago, he was super cool and brought a mini squad for the local pick up games. His passing is godlike.
Adam been having a jump shot for years
Oh y’all thought those moves in his movies were fake?
“Let me call my friend Kevin. We will whoop your asses 2vs2. I bet 1m. “ ….Kevin James shows up.
“Probably”
WHO CARES???
Cool story bro....
I specifically hate basketball
🔥🔥
Huh?
That’s LA FITNESS
Adam always makes sure there is basketball and references to him being Jewish in all of his films
When both guys want each other's autograph.. 😆
he's actually good at the game too
It was great working with him on Just Go With It…when we were on lunch, he had a hoop set up, and we got to shoot around with him…got to meet his family as well…
Hes a cool dude
Adam Sandler is my favoritte american
Who let this homeless man on the court 😂
Dude like the old guy at the courts that makes every right play,  passing is on point, makes every wide open shots and plays at his own pace those dudes low key best players on the court, I take that guy over any flashy wannabe baller any day of the week.
sandler didn’t let money get to him like most ppl did
It's all about how you carry yourself. How you respect yourself. Don't live a life that people would expect you to live just because of your appearance . Be very comfortable with yourself. Be you....... Be Adam.🍺
33
Adam never changes 💯
Adam Sandler always plays basketball on his movies... except that one with the NBA player on it
La fitness courts r fire
Tf is that man wearing
Imagine you a young Bull, high school varisty coming to the gym to work on your craft, then Adam Sandler comes in with Kevin Garnett n just bangs on you😂
This makes a grown man cry. 🥺
That right there, i call fucking amazing
Im tired of everything Adam Sandler does people find so interesting
This man CAN REALLY BALL got the nice j reverse layup flashy no look pass, and the hesi
"Got a piece! Bam! Got a piece of my ass!"
Let me tell you about Sandler. He is an asshole. To people not his friends. To his friends he's a God. Sandler has put all of his friends into all of his movies his entire career, he literally leaves no one behind. In an interview about Grown Ups he was asked why did he decide to keep making 'garbage movies' he said "you say they are garbage but to me it's an excuse to go in vacation with my friends every year."
If you're here watching This and feeling inspired then keep going grinding away! We are all in the same boat here looking for ways to help all our channels. keep up the good work and Never Give Up!
So that's why he is always dressed like that
Why the hell he look so small
Believe Jesus died for your sins was buried and rose again 3 days later and you'll have eternal life
Adam is a goat no kap
Uncut gems is such a good movie, but just prepare for the ending.
Still rockin the baggy clothes
I still think his foot was on the line in grown ups
Uncut gems was so sad
The Bigg Ticket is my favorite player EVER. My son is built like Kevin. Very tall...7'0"...and VERY lean...220 pounds.
Imagine he says “let me call my friend Kevin over” thinking it’ll be Kevin James and bam, KG just pops out 😂😂
For sure Sandler knows his way around a basket. (And a cheeseburger.)
Man, uncut gems is such a masterpiece of a film.... Adam should have won an Oscar
Adam Sandler after kg said that 👁👄👁
Better shooter than Ben Simmons...
I literally was at this gym today. La fitness Atlantic station
Adam sandler asked my dad to play basketball with him awhile back
Uncut gems is a highly underrated movie
Uncut gems the worst movie he’s ever done
That movie was absolute garbage.
His shots are legit
I mean Adam Sandler already played one on one against Michael Irvin
Imagine being a humble person who doesn’t care what the world thinks. Imagine having so much money that it never changed you.
For all the trash movies Adam Sandler makes its weird how such a dramatic movie like Uncut Gems is the first one to involve a camera coming out of his ass.
Jesus loves all
Bro this guy is such a legend
Adam is like Samuel, accepting every movie role
Too bad Uncut Gems was fucking terrible
Adam Sandler love that pass
I love how Adam Sandler is worth 420 million dollars, and yet he’s always dressed like a hobo
Isn't Adam Sandler a trump supporter? Correct me if I'm wrong
Wet jumpshot
Lol
Who is this person so mad lol
Nobody's surprised 🙀
Sets are boring ASF. All you see is trucks like in the back of a carnival, lined up ( If on location ). You have to wait your turn if not the main actor or musician(s). This is why they request furniture, curtains, food..etc    I mean you get paid for the day, but it is stressful. You basically have to be ready at the blink of an eye. They say go, you better be going.    This is a big reason actors or musician(s) bring PAs. They can leave an get you stuff. Even tho you may know your call time, you can not leave an come back. They may need you sooner.    Whatever you do on set has to be limited. Cause at a blink of an eye they may call you.    Actually tho, *SAG* makes main actor(s) have to have time to themselves per shooting day(s).   This is why pranks/jokes come about. It is not all that bad, just a bit stressful. Closed sets are best. Annoying agents go to open sets an try to sell you a pipe dream ( to new actors ). Agents that go to open sets probably work for B and C list celiberties. - Former Body Guard
Perspective: you and your varsity starter bro get challenged by a middle aged white dude in 2s. When his partner shows up its kevin garnett wnd you don’t score a point
Shooting better than Ben Simmons.
Played like 4 games with him on my team at the Reebok gym. Very Cool...pass first kinda guy
And you must love Adam Sandler a creepy amount to have made this.
People hate on sandler to much like bro his movies are more hilarious than any other actors movie I haven't seen a movie with him that I have not laughed in besides Mr deeds that movie kinda sucked but most of his movies are funny but also sometimes serious at the same time its a great combination like click and 50 first dates
He played since he was young in some of his movies he once was a basketball player when he was young
Fun Fact. Earlier on in NBA and American history the first generation of Jews that were put or rather had “ghettos” built for them in NYC were able to learn and master the game of basketball because in these ghettos were only basketball courts. Later on when scores of Blacks migrated from the south or mid west to the east specifically nyc and the Jews grew culturally and financially stronger and moved out in droves (not all obviously) blacks took advantage of the many basketball courts installed in these ghettos and became the next perfect specimen for this sport.
OK., and
This story kind of channnels are dumb. I already know these stuff . Just watch talk shows and u know about these
Sandler has been eating pretty good!😂
DUDE THATS NOT ADAM SANDLER IVE SEEN THIS PERSON PLAY BEFORE
Dude is ballin...
Lmao ooooooooooooo an actor plays basketball for fun. Wtf is wrong with humans. Do they not have any awareness they are alive? Jesus fuck!
Love how all the paparazzi photos of Sandler are always him in like an old t shirt Nike shorts and sneakers while every other celeb is dripped out
Tht pass was crazy smh he got game
He apparently loves fast food even more than basketball.
He actually has it in his contract that there be a basketball hoop on set or within 150 feet of set.
No wonder why Adam was making so much shots when he did grown ups
Damn, Adam hoopin
Adam Sandler and former NBA star Kevin Garnett attended ESPN's The Jump to promote their movie – Uncut Gems. One second Google search, cumon dude try harder
Watch the video closely  I asked the question why are the opponents playing so lazily it seems like there taking it easy on him I'm not saying Adam Sandler doesn't seem to have some skill and I'm not saying every young black man is a superhero on the court but something seems odd about the energy on the court anyone who's ever played basketball to win would know what I'm talkin about
The opponents expecting  Kevin James: 😏🤭🏀 The opponents when it's  Kevin Garnet: 😒😳💩
Adam can't dunk?
Uncut gems sucked ass
Some how i new from a film he had done he have game on the court. I just cannot remember the name of the movie?🤔
Adams Form is crispy
Sandler would have carried with that Duncan Bank shot
