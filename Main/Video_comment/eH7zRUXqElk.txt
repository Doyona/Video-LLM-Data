Maybe that’s why Ja said no to the MIP presentation
Sub✊🏿
Dray called him up Monday night crying that KD got eliminated
Sweep
i like the show.... cool guy.
Dray was dead wrong 😑 Celtics SWEPT the Nets 😂😂😂 and the way Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Al Horford, Marcus Smart (DPOY) are playing together and now with Robert Williams back in the lineup ( there may not be no stopping the Boston Celtics) banner #18 coming right up
This didn’t age well…
Draymond is legit helping other teams get better with his analysis, while competing in the playoffs himself. Head coaches should check this man's analysis out. Draymond always on point.
The Celtics did their thing!! On to the next 💚☘️
It is over
Brody I know you traveling everywhere and can’t carry much stuff but I think you need a better camera. All love Brody no hate
It’s very much over now lol. Thanks for the encouragement Draymond.
Far from over
High as fuck when he said this! Please don't look like an ass next time you make a prediction like this,NETS GOT SWEPT!!!
Dray just talked to us for 20 minutes straight with no script/teleprompter, just speaking whats on his mind. I could listen to Dray talk basketball for hours.
3-0 now
Respect doing his podcast while playing in the playoffs
3-0 whatcha think now ?
I used to dislike Draymond (especially when LeBron was with the Cavs). But after watching his content, I’ve realized the guy is so knowledgeable on the game and life in general, it’s scary. I can see why him and LeBron are such good friends off the court.
Yo Draymond, your genuine analysis is better than the whole ESPN lineup. Please keep it going!
Yooo draymond doing his thing on this fucking podcast shit. Dude in the playoffs and analyzing the rest of the games. I don’t think we ever seen a player do this before
Why are you making a radio show during the playoffs? Shouldn’t you be practicing with Steph and Klay?💪  Edit-1 Now I see you sprained your foot.
Well that’s 3 Dray!! 🤷🏿‍♂️ I couldn’t imagine this coming but we here now!!!
its over Kevin DU - CAN'T better be thinking of next year, KYRIE is useless he wants to blame everyone else but himself he talks about chemistry, someone should inform him that starts at the beginning of the year instead of sitting home whinning about the covid vaccine
It's over. Far from over is NBA friendly thing to say. Green should focus on basketball and wait until his career is over to do this media thing. I will say he sounds so much better today than when he came into the league. He's worked on his vocals, his articulation and that me as a Black man saying that. Go back and listen to D Green his 2nd year in the league.
Ahhhmmm!! Can KD get a txt… Cus my boy need some uplifting and encouragement he seems down and out, he may be having some outside bball issues,  on a life level I hope everything aight..
Man loved your pop cast man. Is unique and aunthentic.  Glad players are doing this more now.  Wait who had an award???? Boston playing ridiculous defense, I'm glad the referee is letting them play.  Finals who do you have?? I have you guys Warriors Vs. Boston
With these amount of data, Dray, becomes more danger to any opposing team...
The next "Inside the NBA" commentator.
Draymond and JJ Reddick are the only analyst that actually analyze the game instead of just looking at generalities...
“because good luck stopping KD".  Oh, hey guess what? Instead of letting KD get 27 points with good defense, the Celts held KD to 16 points on EVEN BETTER defense. By the end of the game, they had ripped the heart out of KD.  How can you tell?  KD took only 1 shot in the last 12 minutes, none in the last 11 minutes of the game when his team was fading away to go down 3-0. You thought KD would put on those Big Boy pants and show the Celtics who was the boss? He actually laid down and said "no mas".  Sorry Dray. You don't know all that much, do you?
This idiot really just said Brandon INgram and Cj mcCollum are better than CP3. Lost all respect for his babll iq.
The disrespect CP3 gets 🤦‍♂️
Welp Game 3 Celtics 3-0. Seems like it’s over
I called twolves upset because they good matchup if they stay consistent.  I think they going win it in 7
What's crazy about twolves game why Finch no timeout you let Memphis go 21-0 run did Finch bump his head
Ben played with Seth played with him and Um Drummond not he sees much min
It's about being humble , not caring about awards or individual accolades like do you think that helps I see guys Giannis he could care less I feel he wants chips. I want see you guys in final I think be great you guys got Kuminga glad they playing him more not fair I'm JS lol . I agree Ben Simmons will not play now that they going get sweep but then again you got nothing lose unless he's really injured
Thats been the ptoblem the whole series. Wy does Steve Nash have a 7 footer bringing the ball up basically playing point and you have yo actual guards on the floor with him??????
Sounding like the future coach of the year he swears he will never be.  Draymond is the most underrated defensive player of all time (so much better than being overrated).  History will redeem you, 🐐. Meanwhile, know that you have throngs of real bball fans that appreciate your greatness. 🙏🏽
I'm listening to this like. Why do I have this thing where I like but don't like DG? Switch on the game. Not a minute has gone by and this guy poked Jokic in the face with his "defense", ohhhhhh. It's not him It's me.
It's over Celtics gone get it
Are from over my butt... 😂😂😂😂  you just lied to us on this take cause you just wanted to pump up your buddy KD.
It's a roll of a dice but if Brooklyn pulls it off with Ben in da line up he gonna get a super rep boost and all that soft talk goes out da window because da reality is that's what winning does
Is this nigga in the playoffs and running a podcast?   Well dayum I need to take notes!!
Draymond: You ain’t locking that guy down for an entire series  Tatum: Hold my beer
Drsymond just wishing it wasn’t over cuz he’s deathly afraid of meeting these Celtics in the finals
Whoops
Dray's going to be a great N.B.A. coach someday ✌️🏀🍺
WELP!!!! .... THIS TAKE DIDN'T AGE WELL!!!!!  😂😂😂😂😂😂
As an SF resident and long time Dubs fan, I knew Green had high basketball IQ, but damn… these podcasts are amazing! It’s changing (again) how I watch the game.  I love this man!
was not a fan of his personality but guy definitely has a high IQ. i'm beginning to appreciate him more now
Draymond is a better coach than Steve Nash 😅
Great analysis but, I wouldn't throw the gauntlet down on CP3 like that. Don't give the man ammunition. 😉
Draymond would be a great coach
You know my day ain’t shit. I’m sitting here listening to draymond green.
MJ did it....The G.O.A.T
No lie , Draymonds show is the realist show for fans that really want to understand the game, dropping jewels here
Mavs shoulda listened to Draymond, man dont miss
The donkey must be feeling really silly about Nets not being over lmao
Guess what? ITS OVER 🤣
Illumination can frighten him who does not seek enlightenment. Wisdom is a gift conspired through love and through power. Any situation that you find yourself in, is an outward reflection of your inner state of beingness.
Hey Dray…promise that you skip the analysis when we go against the winner of this series! GO DUBS ! 😆💪🏻
“You gotta give the ball to the guys who can score the shots!  “. …. 💪🏻👏
Draymond carmex king
Well this aged well lmfao KD is not on the same level as Giannis
Everything you said about Boston and Brooklyn for Game 3....... WRONG!! 😂
❤️ you Dray 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
This was rreal good
They definitely have locked him down this entire series and Irving except game 1 this team is roasted
Hey dray you still believe the series is far from over now that Brooklyn is down 0-3?
Sorry green but that's exactly what they doing locking him down!
It's over dray
Dray giving sports news keep up the good work!! GSW FAN LOVE YOUR SPORTS PODCAST CANT WAIT TO SEE STEVE A SMITH ON HERE😂
I’m here too say they did it in game 3 ….3-0
Net’s are loosers 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Brooklyn got exposed real bad!
Man was dray wrong about CP3, clearly the best player on the floor.
luv brudda, keep it up. Really appreciate having your perspective on other series.
What’s with the pyramid in the back 🤔
Well did not age my boy Draymond.
Pleas put timestamps or text under for every game. thanks
😮‍💨🤣
This guy got a strategic thinking mind, a coach material.

I know he said he don’t wanna coach but jeez draymond is one of the smartest players of all time he’s like an on-court coach
How is your camera lagging? lmao are you filming your screen via a zoom call? also great video You were right as hell about KATs agression to start the game XD dude almost caught a body first play
“ You ain’t locking that guy up for an entire series.” Hmm. OK.
I wonder if kd misses you guys yet? I Think kd and steph we’re a better duo
What you through Draymont if the warriors vs   boston in the final...?
Lol it waned on me, this man remembered all those stats too.  Mid focus on his own games. Lol.  With time a better background and some Muzik, he already has a show !!
It’s over for the nets

Love how he said KARL TOWNS 50x 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Update: 3-0
Celtics just don’t listen to the experts, they go out and win anyway.
It's Over
We gotta see Draymond on ESPN or TNT man.  Dudes got some good perceptive takes.  Especially being the really loud guy he is on the court itself 📢
Its defense plus coaching 4sure. They been saying this since the beginning of the regular season. A all offensive team with no defense is being exploited by a team with great offense and defensive presence. That's why they barely made it 2 the first round. Defense is a very important aspect of the game. People acting like they don't know what's going on.
happy to hear tatum and dray have a texting relationship, that’s a good voice to have in your head
Welp it’s over now
🤔what do U think about them now after going down 3!?😵‍💫🥴😫🤢🤮🤣
Dray you rock with your beautiful basketball mind
Boston Celtics up 3-0 baby!!!!
🧹
Celtics Nets series is over
Mans is posting while in the playoffs…🐐
It’s over draymond Kevin Durant ain’t win a ring without 3 hall of famers on the court
Great insight from a excellent player
Ephesians 5:16 NIV  making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil.
Kerr doesn't run Anything except his mouth. Green runs the team and you could go back through the last 7 yrs to see Green shutting him down and ignoring kerr...
Good luck, im rooting for you guys.... that steal at the end of the game was awesome !!!
Uncensored truth telling by the mouth of Warriors - oops, I meant the "Heart" of Warriors. 💪🏼💙🌟💛
Ok but Ben missed the season because he refused to play, can’t keep paying him if he not gone ply
The wolves are a great example of their bark being bigger than their bite. 🤣
It’s good to hear players mind, it didn’t happen back in the days
Hey Drey, remember that time when you cost the warriors a chip in 2016 by hitting your bff in the balls? Remember in 2019 when you told KD to leave? U r an overrated chump. Can't wait to watch u play a decent team other than the depleted nuggets
Just a thought from what you were saying the other day about who gets to decide who wins MVP and rookie of the Year and all NBA team what if the next collective bargaining agreement negotiations the players were to negotiate as part of the CBA that not only would they have to come up with a actual outline and point system for who would get all NBA team one two or three and who would win the MVP as well as rookie of the Year etc etc then it would be determined by a point system versus the media and you guys could have it put in the collective bargaining agreement so that it was actually done fair and people knew what exactly they needed to do to
Get off of KD. The man has nothing too prove.  Been disharmony on that team.  That's the key word. TEAM
Crazy how he deadass in the playoffs & still grinding & doing this!
You're the man Dray, but CJ is definitely not better than CP3. Not even close. I think CP3 was and is the best player in the series.
Remember why Jimmy Butler left Minnesota.
Nice try Draymond… Brooklyn gonna see yall in the finals with Ben… he’s playing😂 love the show brother 💯✊🏿
Everyone making podcasts nowadays lol like the money these athletes get from the nba and endorsements isn’t enough. 💯
Draymond, you are a brilliant basketball mind!
Dray! Get a fckin stand mic 😂
Yeah right, Boston is miles ahead as a team and as a Pistons fan Ion like em pricks from Boston one bit but they are a helluva team theres no doubt about it. Celtics in 5 eaaaasy
Ths nigga talking sht while still playing in playoffs. He playing mind tricks on other teams.
Bro you are so on point,  I feel Coach should have made adjustments, no disrespect to KD, but working off the ball or off the bench, rather than being made to look weak, using the PJ Tucker defense!!!  This is absolutely Steve Nash' fault !!! Or KD's PRIDE!!!!  Don't let pride cost you the series,. The answer is on the bench.... Aldridge, Griffin, there is got to be more....????
KAT clearly has some things going on that's bigger than basketball. A man who can't yell at the thing or person they're upset with has something disturbing them. And we know well what started his mental issues. Family loses.  So although he's a soft AN, you gotta give him a pass because he's soft while he's dealing with extreme loss, which is bigger than being soft. That could actually turn into self harming. I think with him, let him be. Transition him into a secondary player and surround him with hello because he's a good person. Don't let sports fuq this guy up more than life has already screwed him over.  I don't see him having a big game, or a lasting impact. We will see.
Celtics defense is on locked down I see 3-0 series. Let me mention Al Horford held it down and lit from from beyond don’t feel that Ben deserves to play in the playoff. You earn that. He didn’t put the work in.
Wait wait, you're about to text him? That's not something you need to say. What are you all texting in between halfs? Damn,
What he said about PBev is right but to add on Kat needs to take more shots at the end of the day he has to demand buckets if you take n miss that’s a different story but you can’t be the best player and not take the most shots
It would be one thing if Ben has already played with these guys, but to ask him to build chemistry while being rusty in the playoffs… lmao
That shit bout the wolves facts 4shoo!! I was watching game 3 like why tf do Pat bev keep having the 🏀 in his hands, he looking to score 🥴 like bro wtf is u doing? Get Ah lil Trey or something here n there, but he shouldn’t be acting like just like that 💯💯
i have my thoughts about draymond green but this a good ass podcast
Dray, you’re one of my favorite players. KD can be beast but ya Warriors got LUCKY to win a chip with KD. The Warriors brilliant passing game was seriously compromised when KD was on the floor. I say Yal got lucky because it seems that perception won over your opponents psyche, in addition to shear talent. But if you look at the tape, KDs iso game play killed Yal momentum and called for extra energy
Ben Simmons, savior? ABSOLUTELY! Nets need a point guard. For some reason KD and Kyrie is running the point guard position too damn much. Dragic and Curry need to manage that ball at the top of the play. Coaching gots to stress rewarding their big men for grabbing boards and playing D! They shouldn’t look as Ben as a savior, but as well as Kyrie shoots - he is not their savior. KD catching the ball for a step in shot - win. No dribble !
I just realized something….. Isnt this dude IN THE PLAYOFFS rnn?? Fuckin legend
this dude going to win a chip while podcasting at the same time 😂😂
My man great job
if KD gets swepted while getting locked up like this, I dont ever wanna hear about him being the best "scorer" of all time
If Ben plays he won't be out there for more than 20min
If i were nets and going to play simmons id play him at center. drummond and claxton are just in for D surely simmons can manage that anything else would be + like chances to really push in transition etc.
I love how Draymond drill down facts. He knows the game at the same time fair in giving comments.
Today willl be ofer
No, it’s over
Draymond seems like u didn’t watch that Memphis game. There is never a play that KAT isn’t doubled or tripled team.
Make your own channel Dray! We really appreciate this.
9:35 "you got to get the ball to the guys that score the points" 😂 Draymond Green knows this better than anybody, he's got some of the greatest shooters ever to pass to
Bruce Brown had two great games at home (Boston).
What we seeing is a confident player. He really thinks he has the best team. He knows he’s going to work hard against any player. He has what most don’t that’s HEART. He can give other teams advice because he knows he can lock their best player down
Draymond how are you able to do podcast and still do good in the playoffs. I would think doing podcast will be a distraction
Brooklyn has more celtic fans then nets, just an fyi
Blah blah blah ur saying the same shit others said after game 1, oh kd aint gonna let that happen again or 8rving gonna go off again 🤣
People need to also realize, No team has sold out defensively to stop someone THIS MUCH since MJ. KD is being pressured on ball and off ball as soon as he crosses half court. He gets no free space and always has 2 people on him. Never gets a real Iso situation for long. The Celtics said "lets make KD a non-factor cause Nash is an idiot coach that will still try and feed him the ball instead of running different offenses to try and adapt to the defense"
Talk about y’all series lol
The Best NBA Defender speaking a whole new analyst NBA language. I stop watching the Dinosaur 🦖🦕 NBA commentators post analyst and just go direct to the Working House🐎 on the field. . . Draymond. Looking forward to his post career! But hopefully not too soon. Love Warrior game family dinner night!
Good work DG. Hard work pays. This will blossom down the road big time as the views grow n then a big TV contract. #Ca$hflow
Dray you should be the next GSW coach.
Ben Simmons needs to watch Draymond’s tape and figure that role out. Nets could have their own version of the warriors big 3 and that might be what they should be.
THIS IS HOW YOU ANALYZE BASKETBALL. More Tim Legler, JJ Reddick & Draymond Green PLEASE. Funny how current and former NBA Players are better at breaking down basketball than the media whose job is analyzing the game.
Dray will be a great coach one day
Love the podcast but the disrespect to cp3!!! Pelicans don’t have the two best players on the court cmon DRAY that’s the point god
Draymond, y’all play game 4 on my birthday 4/24. Just put on a show!!
Common Draymond W. His takes are well thought, and thanks for giving credit to the celtics. If you were a casual fan watching playoffs you would think it´s all flukes from the Nets based on ESPN.
DG you said "people don't know what they're looking at" 100% correct but that's your sign to educate the masses and reverse the constant dumbing down of basketball
T’Wolves slightly overachieved this year their coaching has no idea how to make adjustments in game. There’s no hierarchy within the team players don’t know their role I have no idea why pat bev even has the ball during the 4th doesn’t make sense at all. They need to play through KAT. Get KAT hot from early let Memphis make adjustments to him then that will get Ant into the game and everybody else
If he can see it he can defend it.
I hope this second job of his doesn’t cost his team a chip. Should he just be focused on playing in the playoffs?
Yeah green I know you want the Timberwolves to win this series because that’s a easier team for you guys 😂
Spot on analysis
Draymond a great player but he sounds like he got a mouth full of spit
Dray is a monster for this. Frfr. Love this for him
Nets never took the lead back after the Celtics took it
https://youtu.be/dp_moIb9Oac
Cringe af Shrek stick to hoops donkey
Phoenix still winning, they team good enough. for them its nor about CP3 carrying the load
Great content and commentary
This video aged so bad!!! Can’t shut KD down twice?😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 ok Boston on a gentleman sweep
I like how willing Dray was when giving insights for the Minnesota vs Memphis series considering they're playing one of those teams in the second round
I find it jokes that Dray can do a podcast and still have the time to make Jokic’s life a living hell
Dray this is why we should just SMOKE the winner of this series for one we must out coach these teams and lastly we must be smarter with youth comes ignorance
How you going to do the show when you in the finals lol can't wait
Really like this show. Draymond definitely has a broadcast career in his future
I wish he talked about the mavs  game
Use to watch Dray with hometown hooper Adrian Payne.
Brown & Tatum  no telling,  hahaha
It’s wild that he has been so consistent and still playing in the post season. It’s not like he’s injured, bro is on the court and still dropping a pod every  game 🤣
Draymond never has to do a media interview again lol bruh just be like tune in to my podcast 🤷🏾‍♂️😂
Can I get a like on this video for everytime My guy Draymond says he was shocked about something haha 😂🤣😳😅 All love Green All love
I love this man's input on the game @ D.Green
The game within the game analysis is what fans love to hear because generally we the fans love learning more about the game no matter the sport
Draymond you're my favorite player you bum lol
This is way better than listening to some of those clown analysts of some networks!
Dray knows so much about basketball it's fucking amazing
That GSW Culture add to every Player Game. Look at Poole,Even the Great KD Dray who was an late 2nd round pick…Looney,Steph and Klay
That Game 3 steal lol DPEY
Simmons only playing 10-15 min. They just need him for defense. He can handle that much taking a year off.
Appreciate you Dray
I love shit like this man. I've always wondered do these players watch other games on their off days
Draymond leave the Volume and Start your OWN Youtube Channel. Your true Supporters going to be there. “The Draymond Green Show” you are 🔥.
CP3 is easily clear of Ingram and McCollum. That’s a rare bad take from Draymond
Drey is a true fan of the game n his knowledge is through the roof
Bruce brown is a Boston native every game is a home game for him
sub
4444☘️
Y’all got to much blind faith in KD this series is a wrap
Karl Malone wins mvp in 1997 and MJ steals the title from him  Dirk gets 2007 mvp after getting eliminated by Wecandoit Warriors  Admiral Robinson gets wrecked by Hakeem after recieving MVP before game
Dray mentioned steven adams✌🏿
He’s always been so smart. Glad the national narrative is shifting from he’s just a dirty player with a big mouth to he’s a super smart player who must sweet talk the shit out of those officials when he’s not yelling at them.
I think it’s interesting you went right into Minnesota after talking Boston they have a similar issue to what Boston was having with the scoring droughts. Teams were ok with Smart chucking up 15 shots a game as long as the ball wasn’t in Jayson/Jaylen’s hands Pat has to look to get his teammates going the same way Smart does
Draymond sounds like he could be  coaching.
I’m probably the one person that believes this, but, I feel that current nba players shouldn’t have this platform until they retire. Ala, JJ Redick or Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson.
The goat fr
karl towns
The Nets are a joke. They need to get rid of that team. What an embarrassment. They get rid of their future to Boston which lands them Tatum and Brown. And they even took the Nets coach. Nets get rid of their next 7 years of picks again to Houston for a guy that is no longer in their team. What a terrible team.
as a celtics fan I love how we closed out those games but the series ain’t over job not finished
Rob back for game 3
is your ankle okay? update?
Nets role players is stepping up it's the coaching wit the nets
Draymond is a head coach in the making… I see it now. Amazing analysis.
Dray is the real deal. It's true, you have to "do the works" to be a good Analyst.
Draymond, I’ve always respected your mind more than your game! But you should keep your cards close to your vest!
Rather listen to actual basketball players than people on ESPN that never played in the nba
I hate Draymond as a player but man,  never would I expect myself to enjoy listening to him tallking basketball.
One of the smartest NBA players of his generation. Finally getting his flowers. Keep up the great content
Thoughts on Minnesota, gotta call a time out . I understand the first half was ending but in Money time , even the 3rd, gotta call that TO and settle your team.
KD needs yall GSW to win lol
Um yeah that sounds like a lot of disrespect!? The fuck how is the guy who got this team to the finals and even the !playoffs! Not one of the two best players on the court !?  Who the fuck else is over him in terms of awards and accomplishments!?!? 10 time all defensive team 13 time all star 5 time  steal leader and 6 time assists leader and all time top 5-6 PG of all time and all time assists leader with rookie of the year …..so tell me how a kid who just started 3 years ago with only one all star and first playoff and a guy who wasn’t even number 1 on his own team better then CP3….shit CP3 got a resume that is equally to curry so honestly he is the second best play on the floor even when he facing the warriors and the only reason CP3 is second n not first is cuz curry has 3 rings and 2 MVPS    Green is about the dumbest mother fucker to ever talk about an all time top 5 PG 🤦🏾 when his career would not look like it dose now without klay curry and KD iggy
Why just talk about gobert and now how terrible all the other guys are on defense except Royce? Mitchell wouldn’t be able to keep pat bev in front of him ... putting it all on one of t for two good defenders and not on the three trash defenders is kinda sus
Charles Barkley can't talk for shit: "Krispy Kreme"
Draymond ur right, timberwolves gona get choke cause kal anthony can not shoot.
You and KAT giving us insights into the games is something special
Bra doing a podcast in middle of postseason? Lol u a dog fr talk about being calm!! 🐶🐾 let’s bring it home u the heart of the squad
It’s so wild to see a podcast of a guy just shooting the shit analyzing other games in the playoffs that dudes also actually playing in. It’s great. I never really been a fan of dray until I heard him in chillen podcast mode.
Amazing Draymond still have time making this podcast while battling Jokic in their series, well worry about the next round Draymond. You've got the young Grizzlies lead by Bane, Ja and Co. Bet it will run your money.
Boston kept fouling Durant (best player in the world). Nash sucks as a coach, Kyrie pt status put the Nets in this position, no Ben Simmons, Harden quit and not to mention Kyrie is still fasting. The Nets failed KD this season and keep in mind KD did have an Achilles so he always gets the benefit of the doubt for everything he's done and how's he's bounced back
Kat sucks lol. That's why they looking for scoring elsewhere. He's a fouling machine
That is a really good thought for teams that have 22 pt scoring gaps but don't break 100 pts. You can't tell what happened in the game but you know it was intense.
Draymond is gonna be a great coach one day
This is so weird but so cool at the same time. Never imagine content like this when I was a kid in the 00’s 😂
The Celtics need to win :)
The Draymond Green Show - This is so good!
I’m trying to imagine Dray as a head coach losing his fuckin mind over a bad call 😂  Dray is a brilliant dude, like other day, I hope him and JJ are going to help revolutionize sports commentary… listening to him is a pleasure always, and his interviews are always on point
I think dray should focus on the playoffs 😆 tf. The organization is too scared to tell him.
He's right about Ben Simmons' return
Man I like you so much and I like Jokic
keep it up man. we need this kind of content
Take us to the chip Dray!
Kenny, Shaq, and Charles' competition is still playing, and giving post game analysis on the whole playoffs!
This was unbelievable...I'm now a follower!
Almost live from Denver!!! Half an hour after G3 win🤩
Nash needs to get Griffin and Aldridge out there.
Thanks cash you to NBA  🙄👍🏀🏆
Drey would be a good couch actually,  you wanna couch broklyn ????
Yo drey actually knows his shi. No cap. Great game analysis More than Steve nash currently though 😁
African
Draymond make your own channel please. The volume seems like a fake compilation of interviews
The t wolves need a coach. System sucks. Everyone has the green light to jack up shots … dumb af to run p&r with Beverly instead of ant
Remember when casual warrior fans wanted to trade wiggins wiseman and poole for kat 💀💀💀
My man's disrespected cp3 as if he didn't watch game 1 when cp not dbook took over the game and he took over the game again in game 3
On another note If KD takes 50 shots I expect the nets to win lol
This is quality content this man in the playoffs and his show doesn’t stop
Just shows how bad the Wolve's coach is.
This fella knows the game. Damn 🔥😍
Green the GOAT if ya dont agree ya deff a patbev fan 😂
Wait… I thought KD and Kyrie didn’t need a coach? Maybe Kyrie thought he was in a multiverse where the earth is flat and dinosaurs aren’t real when he said that.
looks like kat making a point that he’s the man not antman not d lo 😂
I guess we can all agree that Steve Nash is a very terrible coach🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
This guy is the goat ……He’s commenting as if he’s not active in the playoffs right now ……..Amazing…
Bruh shoutout draymond man is destroying the first round and making quality podcast
I'm glad I got to see when players took matters into their own hands as far as game analysis is concerned! Salute Dray
I think it’s impressive y’all whooping ass & you’re still giving great basketball segments.
bro is in the middle of the playoffs and still managed to do this
Dray, this is fire 🔥 great takes. I’ll sponsor your podcast.
This is unprecedented.
I’m sure like 50% of NBA players are legit listening to this. This is awesome.
Fun fact Bruce brown isn’t going home he’s actually from Massachusetts
This is a perfect take
but imagine turning the series around with ben simmonds? the upside of it. feels like that could get the spark for a ring? i dont think they can beat you anyway but i would love to see a fina between you guys! would be an entartaining finals! sorry for the bad english, its not my first language x)
Dray out here trying to hide his excitement about Booker being injured and what that means for the Warriors NBA Championship hopes this playoffs.
KD looks tired coming off the Gold medal and then a long NBA season....say WORD.
Dray dropping knowledge he gonna be in all the nba teams film day
Draymomd is like the dad of the nba
Somebody as a Warriors fan been enjoying watching the playoffs but I feel bad for T-Wolves fans how do you blow two 25 point leads which in total is a 50 point lead how somebody please explain to me how?
JJ Redick and Draymond Green are my favorite podcasts right now. So much knowledge and very entertaining
Green.  Know. The  games   He  are not. Like. This media.  People
It's crazy i was a big dray fan when he was at msu because of his work ethic he got to the show and some things changed he lost me but sometimes you have to do what you do in order to make it he does have a b-ball iq and i must say he does a good job breaking down the game
i used to hate Draymond but ive come to appreciate his passion for the game, and now with the podcasts and analysis stuff this man has turned me around. Thanks.
The only way to shut down memphis don’t let bane shot 3s. You can let Ja penetrate the rim but you don’t want a 3s all the time. Just like denver they let jokic penetrate and use 2s while warriors making shots 40 attempts in 3s that’s why they get the advantage in gsw and denver match.
Only Sports Talk Show I enjoy; except Shaq and the crew.......thank you because I always wanted to listen to intelligent sports talk but all that is out there is people like Stephen A. Smith which is entertainment not Sports Journalism.......plus he is wrong at least half the time.
this is so great
I think it’s mad cool Draymond play in the games be up in a series than covers the rest of the games lol that’s true dedication! Lol
Robert William's is playing game 3 limited minutes. Hes best defensive Centet in NBA
Why draymond got the pyramid behind him? He lumi?
KAT so soft, he ain’t talked in 6 years then he gets Pat Bev on the team then starts talking, you not that dude KAT needs to find himself
So cool getting a podcast from a current player DURING the playoffs! Dray has his post-basketball career set up. Boss moves
Please let the Celtic sweep the Nets 🙏. One player cannot win no matter how good you are
YOU'RE MULTIMILLIONAIRE DRAY...GET A BETTER QUALITY SETUP. The content is great but the videos look trash.
Love that Dray and Bron are good mates
Love hearing green talk, but this the first time I noticed his head is shaped like that 😂
Unless Durant grows a set and dominates like everyone says he can then this series is over.
Okay who’s this guy?
Nash can't coach  Udoka can coach
Karl towns
Wouldn't it be crazy to have Steph and Seth in the same team? Literally splash brothers?
If your a basketball fan! This is gold! Draymond I hope you become a head coach as Soon as you retire. I think the staff that you choose and your knowledge of the game will bring you success
Durant now getting a taste of how curry is guarded.
Draymond is a smart dude
Dray want them to pull it back cause he’s scared lol
I don't know how I feel about draymond letting his honest thoughts out while being in the midst of a championship run himself.
dray is gonna become a great coach down the road for real
😂😂😂😂  Dray to himself: I won’t shoot 5-26 again Dray again to himself: he did not shoot 5-26 again 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
Crazy how Draymond can talk like someone is asking him Questions lol
Loving this
Dray was fair he didn’t attack anyones brand bro I’m only listening to dray about the game
🔥🔥🔥Analysis
Draymond knows everything about the game
Robert Williams playing game !!   Celtics win game 3. 💯💯👊👊
Series is over.   Boston in 4 games maybe 5!!  💯💯👊👊
Much luv my G. Love the job you doing for our beloved warriors just hope you guys stay fit and focus to the championship 💪🏾
Man is killing in on and off the court. U a role model my dood ! salute !
Difference between him and other analyst is he doesn't bad mouth players who have bad games. Instead give credit to the opposing teams and analysis in a respectful way.  Example. Check the hate kyrie and kd are getting
Dray (let me clap nuggets rq ,and hit this podcast) Green.
Kudos to you "Green Reaper" from the Philippines...
Draymond has a lot of BB smarts, he could probably be a championship coach after his playing career ends if he wants.
Let’s not forget he sprained his ankle just a few hours before this….
Use to not like this guy but i respect him now
It's crazy for a player to be in the playoffs and reporting on the playoffs at the same time. I like it tho lol
Aye man, this was pretty damn good!!!
TBF to the Bruce Brown argument. I understand that role players play better on the road, but homie's from the greater Boston area, so i imagine the extra motivation with a bunch of friends in the family in the crowd probably affect this narrative to an extent.
Dray and Chuck on same page about Simmons. Dont think its a good thing for someone suffering mental health problems to have so much pressure x
Draymond is basically giving teams schematics....🏀....hope coaches are watching..!
I feel Dray is with the Celtics and hopes that the Nets will gonna have difficulty when they match up again in game 3 that's why many people hate Dray because of thinking negativity on other teams
Hey Draymond whats good sir !? Long time Warrior fan here back in the day with late Great Nate Thurmond. RIP. Love everything about you and your play and your journey as a basketball player as a high schooler from Saginaw HS to Mich St playing for the great Tom Izzo. Love what you, Klay and Steph , Iggy, Loons, Wiggs, and now JP bring to the table. The Splash Bros have dominated the media hype for so long. But the way the team is shaped now it stands to be changed into a different name. We heard Hampton 5 and several others but now I say that Splash has turned into "Team Tsunami" .....coming for your team next. A lot of people don't like Death Squad for whatever reasons fine. Lets clean it up then and go with "Team Tsunami" What you think Dray?
Robert Williams is coming back next game: Nets are in trouble.
Love dray for doing this.
Great job Dray.
It’s a splash pool party
I could listen to Draymond talk for hours 💯 one of my favourite players of all time for sure
If dray's going to play on Sunday for Game 4, then, it is confirmed that Warriors can use medical situation to rest Curry.
He right Hakeem cooked David the game he got his mvp
Ppl will hate this but Draymond has lebron IQ….he KNOWS the game very well. Salute good luck in the playoffs. I  wanna see Steph vs Kd in the finals.
Great analysis Dray 🙏🏾
This EPIC. This man in the NBA playoffs and he’s giving his analysis on the playoffs. Dope 💯💯💯💯💯💯
Ummm just play your own game this guy is the biggest knob
I think Green would be a great coach after he retires!
Without pratices and play playoffs? How? 🤣🤣
This is the best breakdown of a game of basketball I have ever witnessed.
It's pretty amazing how Dray how to separe his life. Great management
DG the 🐐 for this shit definitely have a talent for it
Nets in 5
That’s true, it’s look like net’s fans saying ben is like their savior. I mean he can’t save 76’s as well. And comeback to new team, that he never play before after all season off?  It’s like pick random dude who said can hoop and looks like can hoop to a tournament 👺
Draymond is going to be the greatest media personality ever.  👑Not sure about him giving other teams advice though.🤔  And Ben Gordon had 42 in the 2009 playoffs by the way.🏀
KD gotta lift the double teams and hedges with floaters pick and rolls and a couple long 3s to break the wall I think
I LOVE how  your BRAIN explains better than those sport analysts...talking BS. GAME 4 🧹🧹🧹
KAT been playing like a bitch
He’s great at this
I really hope Draymond gets to coach a team after he’s done playing. I’d love to see what that would look like.
bro locked up the mvp then dropped a podcast the next day Legend!!!!!
This is social media at its best.
This man bust the nuggets ass then hops right on his podcast 🤣🤣 that’s wild
Draymond , Thank you for making the  diehard, average and bandwagon fan (s) smarter . Love the passion you have for the game on  and off the court…. GO DUBS !
I had to skip him talking about Karl ANTHONY towns. Idk what point he was trying to prove by saying "Karl Towns" 10 times in 20 seconds. 🤣🤣 But man that was unbearable
People saying Nets is going back home. Y’all know majority of their fans when they play Celtics are Celtics fans right??????  Celtics fans will take over the stadium.
KAT is always agaressive and gets fouled
Unfortunately Brooklyn will continue to make poor decisions in all likelihood.
How does this man have the time
Great show as usual Draymond.  From today I “crown you as MR BASKETBALL”  Your knowledge of the game is phenomenal.  Keep up the good work my brother.
God doesn’t want anybody in hell because He loves us, but you must understand why we deserve hell and why those who refuse to live under His authority will go there. He gave us the law (Ten Commandments) not to make us righteous, but rather to show us our sin (Romans 3:20). We’re not sinners because we sin, but rather we sin because we’re sinners. Sin is the nature of our flesh that we are born with due to the sin of Adam in the garden. For someone to be justified before God they have to be sinless. We’ve all sinned (Romans 3:23), and the the law demands death for those who sin (Romans 6:23). God is righteous, so He must punish our sin, which is what He did through His Son Jesus Christ on the cross. Jesus is Holy and sinless, yet He received our sin when He died on the cross, so that we can be righteous before God (2 Corinthians 5:21). When He died on the cross, He said “It is finished” (John 19:30), which means He paid the full price for all of your sins (past, present, and future) to be forgiven. He was buried and rose again from the dead. God will forgive anybody who puts their full trust in Jesus Christ alone for salvation. We aren’t saved based on our good deeds, but only by the grace of God (Ephesians 2:8-9). His precious blood that He shed is the only reason why we can be forgiven of our sins (Hebrews 9:22). If you confess that Jesus is Lord and believe that God raised Him from the dead, then you’ll be saved (Romans 10:9). You are born-again with the Spirit of Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17), and are not only legally justified before God, but also are accredited His righteous (Romans 4:24). Believers live for Christ now, so get to know Him through His Word. I recommend reading the book of Romans and the gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John), and watching Pastor Joseph Prince’s online sermons!!
Too bad pat bat ain't as smart as Dray. He's like the 2nd most delusional player, he was like thinking himself is the biggest reason the Wolves are in the playoffs
He's right.. Celtics lost on the night KG got his # retired... too much pre-game emotion!
Coach Dray
Dude makes the best play of the series and hops on a podcast the day after. Literal GOAT🐐🐐
Just cuz draymond is famous doesnt mean he isnt a normal person like you and I
Dray when you retire from the NBA hit me up, you got a future as a sportcaster. I won’t be able to pay you tho but I promise we’ll split everything down the middle
Good game last night.  Solid defense
This dude using Stephen a smith vocab say “that’s mind boggling to me”😂
Tell Steph 😳
Dray still have time doing podcast? Oh they are up 3-0 ok
Great show! Though there was only one lead change in the Celtics Nets game - a shot from our boy PP
Gotta love dray for this. Doing podcast while playing in the playoffs. That’s dope
What a savant! Only thing I can complain about your videos Money Green is the video quality. Bruh for $60 you can quadruple the video quality. RN it looks like your hotboxing 🤣
cant wait till sunday sweep of nuggets go dubs
great job against jokic
Dray is a grinder. much respect. he deserves another championship not even gonna lie
i like how yu bring your perspective on games go dubnation keep the videos coming
You need another voice to help your podcast Dre. Another perspective would do wonders for your show . When you interviewed Steph that was a great show.
Hearing from a top NBA in the league while he’s playing, without filter is a dope experience much better than NBA countdown
I'd live to hear drays thoughts on multiple  people having career high 3pt % vs the nuggets in the playoffs (including steph, dame, d mitch and more) and also some stats regarding the lack of fts the nuggets get historically, such of players to average 24 points or more in the playoffs (all time), 3 of the bottom 4 in fta are nuggets players and, despite being near the top of teams to score in the paint for the past 5 years, they have not even once cracked top 20 in fta as a team (I believe the highest they got was top 23 if I remember correctly), and plenty of other evidence we have that the nba doesn't seem to like the nuggets
Dudley is a future head coach.  DG is a great analyst!!! This is real analysis  !! Jj is also very good.
Dray, you a legend dude. Great podcast.
This is So facts about everything that your saying. I love little insights like this. Makes me appreciate the game of basketball and the game within a game 💯💯 love it keep it up 👍🏻
I think the reason Ben Simmons comes back is to introduce himself to Brooklyn in a post-season appearance rather than expected production. They don’t want him to not feel playoff basketball for an extra year. Give him a taste, the Nets don’t look favored for an championship this year, but next year he knows what he’s working towards. There’s a Hail Mary chance he completely changes the floor for the Nets on both ends of the court, but I don’t think anyone is expecting that.
I think kd is tired from trying to run the offense (iso ball) and keep everyone involved plus playing so many minutes
Lmao Draymond telling MFs how to win
Draymond is in the playoffs and prepping with his team, watching all the other games, analyzing and doing a podcast... thats dedication and talent
Lol cp3 is better than cj and Ingram, come on man
appreciate you!
bests and only team in the west are the warriors rn other team are hurt or just not good enough
Gsw are sooo lucky to face a depleted team in the first round, but the grizz will blow em out. Gentlemen sweep if they feel kind enough
if ben simmons returns and thy still take the L.... theyre gonna clown simmons more
Agreed. Brooklyn needs to close out the games better. They would of been up 2-0 right now. Then we would of been having a different conversation. Good series let's see if Brooklyn can get it done.
Bruce was at home lol
Everyone knows the game isn't over until the final buzzer. The nets didn't have game one or game two, buzzer beater or big lead doesn't matter they lost them both. The nets obviously have talent but talent alone isn't enough in the playoffs against a top defensive team like the celtics. Watch the C's sweap the nets.
dray is giving pointers  to Minnesota because he knows the grizzlies are a problem for the warriors!!! 😆😆
I'm pleased with Draymond's analysis, knows a lot about the mechanics of the game.
Draymond smart high key..
Not a huge fan of draymond but his analysis of what the Twolves are doing wrong seems spot on
i Believe at one Point minnesota was up 26 in the fourth, then 11 minutes later they were down 12. that has to be a record
What
Sup with the illuminati symbol guy
Stfu Wesley snipes you talk too much
Dammit. Dray got me subscribing
that's because Nash sucks
Dray Boston got that pad 🔒 on 🤷‍♂️
Draymond they had game 1 won lol what u saying bro  did u forget the Celtics blew a 15 point lead that game of it wasn’t for kyries heroics that game is a blowout for the Celtics
Nash can’t coach!!!!!
Draymond! I was so fired up when you got the steal on Joker. DPOG - Defensive Player of the Generation!!
Wow, I’m really taken back by this breakdown. Drays IN THE PLAYOFFS and did a better job than others that have nothing else to do but watch the game and provide analysis !
Draymond is funny we just locked kd up 2 games in row I mean the guy is doubled off ball I never seen nothing like this Celtics game plan is clear  everybody else can beat us on the court expect the head of the snake and that’s kd ohhh and we’re getting Robert back arguably are best defender lol
Draymond can literally be an Analyst and be great or be a coach and be great after he hangs it up, he’s entertaining and has an amazing basketball mind. Most underrated player in the league from a Cavs fan who used to hate his fuckin guts
Draymond is a really good analyst. I said the same thing. Pat Bev should not be taking more shots than Towns.
The thing is you can say opposite way for Boston they haven’t played there best offensive game against one of worst defenses and found ways to win that’s one!! Two sounds like rob is coming back!! 3 you got Pritchard gaining confidence along with brown Tatum and others now they about to go on the road where they have played way better this year in the road!!! All that combined Boston is due to come out clicking on all cylinders offensively!!! Only route I see nets wining is KD and KI dropping 30 plus a night and assists rest of the way through!!
I no longer watch First Take or ESPN. Thank you Draymond 🙏🏾
I love that it’s another guy from Michigan who has a real eye for basketball is teaching y’all the game. Keep it up my guy. Saginaw Pride 😂
Hard working man! Much respect my guy
man this guy is different. Playing in playoffs, and doing podcast... Respect
Imma laugh my ass off when we shut him down the whole way and sweep gonna love it!!
Dramond is cool AF 🔥👌 I'm a fan
Nigga playing in the playoffs talking about other teams playing in the playoffs
Yo dray don’t you have a series of your own to worry about lol don’t you worry we will be seeing you we gonna sweep these bumbs and we will be on our way!
Man, this analysis is awesome!
dray, you need a camera my man.
Loving the content Dray, get yourself a mic stand though to free up both hands (or a mic that clips to your shirt).
Minnesota is a dumb team. The coach never called a timeout to end Memphis run
The coaching staffs.. I know KD will adjust ..
I'm curious to see if draymond will still have these when they lose a game or go down in a series. Knowing him I'd say yes
Of course it’s far from over.. Celtics still got two more games they’re gonna win before moving on.
Not draymond becoming my favorite nba commenter / analyst … if you told me this years ago I would’ve slapped you
As a heat fan I kno dragic does show up n big games
THE SMARTEST PLAYER IN THE NBA BY FAR
I love to see d rose come bác to Chicago now ))
Draymond sporting the illuminati pyramid flanked by the ubiquitous phallus.  Tell you what people guys into that stuff look at the rest of us as useless fools.  Bank it.
why not talk about the Jazz vs mavs series? oh yeah Draymond hates Gobert, I almost forgot
In what world is McCollum and Ingram better players than Chris Paul ☠️
Draymond has a job after the nba if that’s what he wants to do . Speak on sports 🏀 especially because he played and he’s a decent talker too .
Dre, Chopped onion on that ankle in Saran wrap overnight will fix up that ankle (if applied within the first 12-24 hrs). All the best ...🙏
If 3guy on kd mean someone is open!!!!. Agrreeee?!!! The other guys show they can be depend on, the game hav 5guys lollll the net only play 2 lmao
The situation net n Celtic is simple. If is the war, everyone is on curry, he never hav to shoot , dats how steph curry kill the defense without shooting .
Boston Celtics head coach is not getting enough credit for the way he's coaching this team.
When Steve Kerr was asked if he too listened to Draymond's podcast, and him saying no, i hear him talking during practice all the time already... hahaha.. Draymond... just great!
Yo dray, brother I love u stand up for pool, like u say, he is the most improve player without saying.
Good shit. This is the type of stuff we love to see. Analysis and insight from players. Not these hot take artists on these other shows just doin shit for views.
Rob Williams back. Series is over in 4 gms
Let him come back...Boston got sometinnnng for him.
Towns is a great player but mentally is still so immature
You can't blame Pat Bev's aggressiveness on why KAT shot 3/4.  KAT needs to take a page out of Pat's playbook.
It seems like Boston is playing man to man until kyrie or kd touch the ball then they switch into a str8 double team 🤔
Draymond giving teams good insights and great gameplan man like they ain't on the same western bracket.  HOF!!
Hey Draymond, what's your pre-game ritual if you have one?
in what final has he ever made a difference  in fact he scored 0  etc..  If there was mental health before that action will make it worse .
Nets need to share the Ball more.
Draymond deserves everything that comes his way dude kept his head down and went to work most tv analysts have been saying he does nothing but all of a sudden they are coming around
Let’s be honest if Brooklyn was going against Atlanta KD and Kyrie would probably be putting up 40 points each every game. The reason they’re not is because of that Celtics defense.
This is a different pod cast; thanks Draymond. Good luck in the playoffs.
thank you dray
yooooooooooooooooooooo
you would think he isnt playin in the playoffs the way hes talking
Finally someone who we can listen 2 that has actual experience in what he’s talking about unlike people like skip
I really appreciate Draymond’s analysis…it’s nice to hear an actual take from a player that isn’t just a role player.
not playing a single game then to come back from an "injury" right  into the playoffs  would be absolutely insaneeee
This is the dopest NBA content you the goat for this Dray
Not gonna lie, Iv always hated draymond, not personally but because he’s one of those people you hate when he’s not on your team, but love to have on your team. After watching these videos and seeing how much respect he actually has for other good ball players and the game itself, it really has turned me into a draymond fan! I love seeing great players speak with passion about the game they love not just because they’re playing in it either but because he loves basketball. It’s like talking with your friends
Leaps and bounds ahead of other guys trying this. JJ for example talking about winning playoff games, eh doesn’t really land. Hated playing you guys as a Bron fan but keep up the great work. MI represent for sure.
Dray out here doing a better job of coaching than the actual Timberwolves coach lol
Best defender in the world
It's over bro
I love the pod but idk how I feel about analyzing possible next opponents. It's like "don't give dem mfs no tips or motivation! " Lol
The Simmons thing is just weird. Dude doensn't have a back injury. Some mental health stuff he clearly doesn't want to divulge.
Please don’t sweep the Nuggets Dray let them win 1 game
Peace and love
What’s gonna happen if both the Celtics and warriors make the finals, is he still gonna do podcasts about it? Lmao. Jokes aside though every nba fan needs to sub to this man. This is the best basketball content on YouTube
KAT plays to much on the perimeter. He need to just dominate the post.
Draymond fair Analysis. I like that.   Don' t Yell @ us on the Court though
big FAN OF YOUR PODCAST DRAYMOND, RATHER TOWATCH YOU THAN SKIP BAYLESS AND INCOHERENT COMMENTS
Draymond can smell another championship with Booker going down, I hope Booker is back in time for warriors v suns!?!?  BTW so great to have analysis from a playoff player DURING the playoffs 👏 👌
The thought of Ben Simmons being hailed a saviour coming back in Game 4 is hilarious
Man, this brother will be able to do whatever he wants when he done with basketball.  I would like to see Draymond and a College coach then a NBA coach.  This brother knows his shit.
🐐 stuff dray
He gotta love this game. I'm impressed by those games breakdown. I see him doing it after he is done. Bravo Draymond!
I swear I used to hate draymond but he won me over now
It’s over. Rob MF Williams is coming back 2morrow 😜
Thanks, Dray.
Bruce Brown had a good game because he was home!! He is a Boston native playing against his favorite team.
And y’all said Draymond was riding coattails. He’s changing the game in his own right
DG!!!! Scary knowledge-bombs always. Love this podcast and wish you and the Warriors much success the rest of the way. 🙌🏾
Dray makes an excellent point early on — it made absolutely no sense that the Nets kept allowing KD to dribble the ball up considering it was a minefield for him.
Man KD would be laughing saying the warriors cooked if we was down 2-0 i dont like the friendly bop too much
The pyramid 🤔 its only 10 % left before maxed out here are your 2022 NBA Champs Poole has converted..
The show should be named "Absolutely Incredible with Draymond Green"
Am I the only one who finds him saying Karl Towns hilarious?
Warriors have player coaches. Makes sense why they so good
😂😂😂😂 this man is killing the nuggets on the playoffs then coming here to talk about kd this man is a legend 🤣🤣
We still ain't beat Denver.. stay focused
I'm a huge fan of yours and the Warriors Draymond. You guys playing the right way, all staying humble, all contributing, playing the right way and all together. I still think people don't appreciate you guys enough: great roll-models. Good luck in the playoffs!
Like hearing guys who actually played/play basketball talk, without the hot-takes, bias, and agendas.
🔥 analysis 🐐
Draymond is the only sports person talking some sense, everyone else on ESPN and what not just talk out their ass it's just ridiculous
They miss Harden bringing up the ball and initiating the offensive big time.
This is his calling after basketball because he can analyze the game the right way and he has a high IQ of the game so I love his commentary of the game and he is playing in the playoffs so big ups to Draymond and keep up the good work
THIS SERIES IS FAR FROM OVER .... HOWEVER .... KD IS LUCKY HE JOINED THE WARRIORS WHEN HE DID BECAUSE I DONT SEE THIS MAN WINNING A CHIP UNLESS BEN SIMMONS TURNS INTO DRAYMOND 2.0😂....  AM I WRONG???? ... PUT BLAKE GRIFFIN IN HE CAN JUMP CARS LOL
Draymond is the perfect guy to join the inside crew I can’t wait for his second career after he retires
Why is this rich guy using a webcam?
Were the Celtics not Up 15 game on? So how did they have it won. How’s both ways man
The real conversation here is ....Can you imagine if KD never left and the lineup was Steph, Klay, Draymond, Poole and .....KD!!!! Boy I know for a fact he sees Golden state on TV he wonders what would have been and how big of a mistake he made
You and JJ are fully responsible for bringing me back to basketball after about 7 years 🤝
Amazing insight from arguably the highest IQ player in the game, while he’s in the playoffs himself! This is badass.
Dig the format! Scary hours for the rest of the league, best of luck
Draymond who would you rather see??  Grizzlies or Timberwolves??
Brandon Ingram dropping 40 tonight,go Pels 💪💯
As Well As the warriors are playing, for some reason I got a feeling they are going to lose in the second round …
Hey dray its celtics vs warriors finals match up
Hope that ankle heals up bro!
How about coach Finch not calling a timeout during either of the Grizzlies huge runs. The Twolves are way too young and inexperienced to figure it out on their own. Horrible coaching.
The ability of Dray to pay attention to another playoff game that ended 15 minutes before his own tip-off, and then proceed to beat the dog shit out of the nuggets… and then relay back that info back to us!! Not the hero we deserved, but the hero we needed.
keep it real dray great work
Such a good man so inspirational
Please Dray, come to Inside after Chuck retires
You better not get loose before the finals media and fans are coming for you
Dryamond is so right about Minnesota. Having Beverely shoot 10+ times per game is a recipe for failure.
Love you dray  your gonna crush it in media game after your retirement
My man really playing a game and coming home and talking about it. Elite!!!
rob williams is back. the series is over]
Love the podcast. Gives great insight on how players think outside of the camera. Keep going Draymond!!
Inside the inside scoop. I’m enjoying this so much.
Love green
Man I really appreciate Draymond for doing these recaps even with him still playing rn. This is the best postseason content right now
I was a Ben Simmons fan but now I don’t think he can handle pressure I thought he was the next lebron more like a  demigod lightskin  draymod that can’t shot
draymond you a best busting ass in games then coming an tellin is about every game
Love Dray
I can’t wait for Dray to retire and start coaching. His basketball IQ is too high to not be a HOF player AND HOF Coach!
We rather listen to an actual player like dray rather than these morning show hosts.
I think GSW will play the Celtics in the Finals...
Absolutely love your basketball analysis. Really great content and even though you needed to learn a few things when you started... you were built for this.
Draymond, great show man. Great to hear a players voice (with championship pedigree and "in the playoffs") speak truth and perspective "in real time". Bring it on man! I'm a C's fan, yet admire your work ethic and who you are. Keep up the great work.
bruce brown is from boston boston is his home he was tryna show out
God I hate the narrative-based analysis you’ll find on ESPN or pretty much any television station
2-0 is what you are supposed to do. Steal one on the road and close it out in Boston. Go Celtics☘️!!!!
Real commentary from a real player not just some analysts trying to get views
Love your insights

You the mfn goat dray

Yup Dray’s Goated for this. Inside analysis from an analyst that’s actually playing in the playoffs? I love it
his honesty and giving credit is so refreshing to see
This is proper sports commentary.
would love to see Draymond take on Stephan A Smith on First take !! Who esle would like to see that ?  likes below
Aldridge should get more time
Nash gotta add Dragic to the starting lineup over Seth & Claxton over Drummond. Kyrie & KD are all-time scorers not playmakers(KD won with Steph/Draymond& Kyrie with LeBron as primary playmaker) they need to play more off-ball to lower turnovers & control tempo.  Dragic can defend, facilitate & shoot, Claxton will be better on the switches b/c he has better lateral movement than big body Drummond.  Celtics run 2 shooting bigs(Horford/Thies) & it takes Drummond away from the paint so he can’t rebound at a high clip & forces him into switches off screens. Claxton has better recovery speed defensively. Drummond is a good passer to having him off the bench with Seth Curry & Patty Mills helps b/c Drummond can draw help defense in the post & is a good passer out the paint to shooters.
Draymond green is from the same neighborhood as Stevie wonder 4th n kirk area
