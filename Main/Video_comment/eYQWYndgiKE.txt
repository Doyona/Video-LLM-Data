Me going back and watching these videos again...sucks because theyre muted in so many places -_-
Yo CJ remember you did that black Force energy for Tokyo revengers yeah you may want to exhibit C all the way to exhibit F because season 2 and season 3 yeah you may want to strap it and there is also one more thing season 4 doesn't come out until the next year so good luck
Free my boy 10:04
AYE CJ MAKE A ASYLUM VID ON KISAKI TETTA CUZ THE GUY AINT OK IN THE HEAD PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEE
does anyone know why the audio cuts once per video

Cj you gotta finish off this series😭🙏
1:01 What is the name of music in the background?
Dude the intro is so wild I could not believe what I was seeing and hearing
9:11 Someone pull up nagisa He lowk has his moments
Many of your videos got audio issues....
Bro might actually br funnier than Trarags
Still waiting for new TR round table updated video lol
truck kun as a hummer?! bruuuuh
7:14 I hate to understand this reference bro 😭😭
Interesting fact about Tokyo Revengers, the mangaka was a member of an actual motorbike gang when he was younger.
Die. Yay. Murder. Yay in that order is WILD😭
before the audio cuts this was his best work L youtube
Entire video has audio missing in some spots
Riley would not let that slide
I can totally see why CJ would call Tokyo Revengers "Black Air Force the Anime" given the brutal things that happen in it. 💀
Its worst in the live action
😊❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
My favorite anime to watch is Tokyo Revengers👍 I love it so much.❤️Your content is so great and so funny 🤣❤️
Yall audio go out too??
1:58 IS THAT A JJK REFERENCE
Plus it's based on a true story
6:01 cuts the audio again 😅
the fact that some of these characters are the same age as me (some of them younger) is terrifying me😭😭
Ngl, when I first saw this video and your other one, it made me want to watch Tokyo Revengers and I never went back ever since /pos
We need pt 3
Do windbreaker.
I need whlted forced energy and shades!
I'm almost at season 2 ts fire🔥🔥
cj need to talk about the rest of the 4 season it kept on gettin better and better
does anyone else have their audio club
they are not middle schoolers age of mikey is 28 year old
Truck-kun and Train-chan want to bond by ruining the guy live at the beginning
Personally was hoping pah woulda done red coat dude game of thrones style  When “THE MOUNTAIN” crushed the mans eyes in and then his skull because his opponent thought the fight was already over
12:55 yooo ginyu force cameo?!?!
Ngl even I was so stunned by the aura even I had to bow down to Mikey when I first saw him haha
What's awesome about Takemichi's friends is that they knew Draken was in a gang but they pulled up to protect him...   THAT'S WHAT GOOD LEADERS ARE!!!  Ngl, I'm a sort of leader in the military (I'm being vague because nobody need to know specifics here)... exactly how Draken is, is how I am with my peeps. In a heartbeat, Imma throw hands with anyone sorry ass who tries to fuck with them...   Me: Bubbly, happy-go-lucky, kind, fun one minute...  Also me: Wrath of God himself blinded by rage of a thousand warriors    It helps not giving a damn about living. Makes it easy to push through pain 😅
Tokyo revengers is THE G.O.A.T
Why is baji soooooo FINEEEEEE
Bro why do every one of your vids have audio cut outs 😭
"Thank you for opening for the main event" 🤣🤣🤣

Ayooo CJ Tatsuya from Irregular at Magic High School has that Black Force Energy

Why is the audio cutting out
Make one about S2 or S3 Bru 😭
Drop the new Tokyo revengers
3:43 there is no volume anyone
According to the manga, the only reason they broke up was because her dad didn't want his daughter dating let alone marry a delinquent and he even forced Takemichy to break up with her after a conversation.
Audio keeps cutting out bro
your OP is getting nostalgic good job!
They got their a** beat so bad the audio left

The: oh hell don’t tell those tissues are the after math of beating your shit go get your lazy ass and go put it in the trash got me rolling
Yooo… I’m dead 😂 this shit fucking me up
It was also the All Mighty Truck-kun that slumped Kisaki
Idk bro, I don't wanna watch most of those aniems because I enjoy your commentary a lot. 😂
I honestly hate it when I'm watching these videos and in the middle of it...COPYRIGHT strikes and mutes the audio. Like- LEAVE MY BOY CJ ALONE😭
No matter what anime that I watch truck is always here somewhere just waiting for it moment to shine🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
I laughed so hard when kisaki gets got by truck kun
What was the song at the end ?
Mikey got so much aura he cuts off cj's audio
Heads up on Tokyo Revengers! The creator, Ken Wakui, was in a gang himself back then called Black Emperor. He created the anime because he wished he could travel back in time to fix what he wanted so the future can be different. Japanese gangs were very popular from the 1940s-1970/90s. That’s why there’s a lot in the anime.
What about truck kun do truck kun just sit him in the court bro
Cut out audios from: 3:35 to 3:50 6:01 to 6:16
Seeing again after 3 years
Superman dying to a train is crazy 😭
We still waiting for Cj to make a part 2

14:48 BIG DADDY TRUCK-KUN
Nah the audio it happened in the madara video too
Cj is the king of hall of fame black Air Force energy
Bro review the new seasons
What is Tokyo revengers on?
This is an idea but what if truck kun was so tired of the boring isekai that he feels like all hes doing is recycling trash protagonists to trash isekais and he took it out in hina a victim who he can actually have fun with for once because their reactions arent boring to him and hes probably having fun with it too especially with the interesting plotline hes seeing and assisted in certain parts of it
I just finished this show on Hulu. CJ, my nigga, you be watching some dope ass anime. Black Air force energy dripped from these delinquents!
0:25 season 2 and 3 are out chop chop ma boy

Y’all ever seen the guys that do anime drinking games. They needa get on cj as a guest star idk
Can you do season two
Nicole watterson has black airforce energy
Yo what's that background music at the beginning? (Before the cj intro)
That tissues thing at 2:20 was a great catch. I don't think I ever would have noticed that.

The adio keeps cutting out during the fight scenes wh is that?
Is it me or the audio
Who’s here in 2024? 🎉
The hell with the random audio cuts?
Truck-kun having beef with Hina is the highlight of my day😂

wait til yall see windbreaker😂
Ngl tho middle schoolers kinda do be like this tho I remember when I got attacked over chess and how we was breaking the doors and windows 3 times
Does anyone know what he was saying whenever it cut off?
For those of you wondering about the missing sound in some places: DMCA shit happened, so CJ had to re-edit this video. I should know, I remember seeing this video before the re-editing happened.
:)
3:40 it’s bad when it goes silent u know bro was prob in jail making this
This show would’ve been so good if you just got rid of Takamichi and the stupid time travelling plot. Make it an anime about Youth Gangs with the same characters and it’s a 10/10.
Have you seen 😳 season 2 yet it is more wild than ever my nigga
You can’t do bakis dad with putting the new Baki vs kengan in there and when Bakis dad shows up to throw the fade REAL BLACK AIRFORCE ENERGY
Anyone else having sound issues?
Damn so much of the video is muted. 🫤

Jesus loves us all

Why is the sound cutting out
I wish this wasn’t copyrighted, so I would hear everything.

Did the sound stop for anyone else at 3:36 then cut back on at 3:51
16:11 y’all can TELL CJ does not like this man 🤣

Loses sound at 3:37
No one is talking about how’s there’s no audio at 3:36-3:49 6:01-6:16?
TRUCK KUN THE WORLDS BEST VILLAIN
getting a full face tattoo at 13 years old is one of the stupidest things i ever heard, i mean, i like to think your head will grow at least a little speaking physically
The audio keeps cutting out in a lot of your vids
The fu no audio
Bro ur audio skipping
Its censorship
No sound in sections of the video.
Why did it go silent at the start
Why does this audio cut out?
Excellent video
This video makes me wanna get some Black AFs because I really enjoy Tokyo Revengers!
Is it me or is the audio cutting off in some parts of the video?
Big daddy truck kun is the main menace
I don't think I'll ever be able to bring myself to watch this because the one that got away was some girl I liked when I was 13 in the eighth grade (no, really). If I'd had the balls to ask her out, she likely woulda been the last girl I dated for a long time. So watching this will bring up way too many painful memories. Also it's dawned on me that I'm 25 and some loser who still watches anime on his laptop. I mean the previous anime series I watched was Nura, the premise of which being normal by day, beast by night; couldn't help but think "that should be me!"
Damn why the audio cuts now?
DAMN
Train-chan from Gantz strikes again!
13:57 Bro, I Remember Seeing This When I First Watched, And I Don't Remember My Exact Reaction, But Watching This Video It Gave Me Chills. (And The That Sucks Part Made Me Chuckle).
At 1:38 time the audio turned off for about the hole cene

Damn, coming back to rewatch, i didnt realize cj got his audio cut.
Whether it is somebody reporting or just YouTube being a hater the blocked parts make me so sad but I can just imagine what he said I hope he comes back and fixes it one of these days
did the audio go away at 3:35 for everyone or just me
Fun fact this videos sound blocks out at least five times.
Whole ass anime got that black airforce energy
This is my first real exposure to TR's storyline, I'm leaving the video at 13:45 to watch the anime real quick
Hanama blocked Mikey's kick once and never again
CJ actually built the table of black AF energy
Dude why is the audio turn off randomly
Demon  wheel
Cj i know this is an old video, but any advice on growing a YouTube channel
why is truck kun not on the round table?
I found out something I searched up What grade Mikey is in and it said the fifth grade and I was like what? No No no no no no no No oh wait Yes yes Yes yes because guess what they're still in grade school because in Japan it goes one through six. If they were in middle school it would be 7th through like 9th or eight I don't know
YT why are beeping this video!!!
Is the black Air Force energy
0:43
The audio keeps cuuting out in the video. I know its not my phone cause i replayed the parts at least 23 times.

Great video, but I believe that there is a part in the video where the audio is cut off. At least after watching the same part a few times I never had audio at the time of 3:35-3:50 at 6:00-6:15 too

Apparently this is based on a real story. The creator was a gang member in the early 2000s in Japan!
Back again with Golden chopsticks Chinese food this time

Yo man, I just want you to know: I skipped on this show when it first dropped because it didn't seem like something that would be my cuppa. Then I saw you had put out this video and I was like, "Damn, I guess I GOTTA go watch it now," before I even watched your video, cause I KNEW if you covered it, then it was gonna be worth it, but I didn't want spoilers. So, much obliged CJ. I watched the show, came back to watch this now, and comment just to say thanks. You a real one.

Can you please do a video about how zamasu has black air force activity? ( Including Goku black cuz it's another zamasu in disguise )
Why does it just cut out at 6:13 weird?
Where tf is there parents tho 💀
You gave the respect ge deserves and for thank you
I had a phrase for baji, If you see a hair tie you about to die.
Am I the only one who's experiencing moments where the audio cuts out?
to this day I have no idea why tokyo revengers takes place in middle school that shit is retarded like theyre 12. I liked it but itd be better if they were adults
Can we all age that baji has black air force energy
Please review season 2! You’ll see takemitchy has been leaving his ‘tissues’ around him for years😅
11:07 what is that sound effect with the croud noise in the background?
So yo is it jus me or the volume cut out when the ass whooping initiated after the goku meme?
*Wanna see some japanese gang shit ? Watch (or read) Tokyo Tribe !*
Paul just like me frl
Ok why is some of the sound removed?
your intros are sick :)
As
CJ I can’t wait till you see season two like bro it gets wild
3:35 broken audio till 3:50  also 6:01 till 6:16  dont know why theres no audio
wow. the censorship on the YT video is killing me.
9:17 naurr he WALKED UP TO HIM AND BEAT HIS ASS AND HE LOOKED GRACEFULL WHILE DOING IT
Bill Cypher from Gravity Falls for the round table
Why tf is this censored?
Ay go to 5:20 you will see a dude who looks like Mikey in the background
having a girlfriend die sucks, it's worse when they unalive themselves though. soooooo much worse
I think i remember hearing something about the author actually being in a gang.
He hit the boondocks music @12:03 yk shit bouta get stupid
Anyone know what song this is at 13:58? I know it’s from the bleach hellverse movie but idk what it’s called
Audio keeping cutting out. no, I won't give the time stamps. Complain to YouTube about not being able to control the vid while typing
Every member of TOMAN is pure Black Air Force. Takemichi however...biggest crybaby protagonist i have ever seen in anime. Like seriously i thought that Deku from MHA was crying too much in the beginning of the series. But after seeing Takemichi....i owe Deku a strong apology for ever considering him a crybaby. Early Deku is Chuck Norris compared to Takemichi. Takemichi is lame. Also...Mikey is Isekai'ed Whitebeard.
Bro, make a Patreon so that we can watch these videos. Unedited, YouTube you suck for making him sensor his videos. Shame on y’all.
7:53 next time move out the way or catch the kick and throw the little bastard
As someone who grew up in Japan in the 90s, can confirm bullies are brutal AF 😂 Gang wars every weekend.
It would be really funny if you were the narrator of a comedy anime 💀
What’s happening to the sound
I just did workouts to this anime
How I imagine school would be on planet vegeta
Audio cuttin out at the worst times. I know this is some Susan shit tho
I think the correct way to say it is "Smoking with ciggawetts"
Hina needs her own spot
Who else has the volume cutting
The fact this all happened in MIDDLE SCHOOL this would happen after college or something💀
The biggest menace of all time are the niggas that say ur mom after every sentence💀
Did the video audio cutout in the middle for anyone else?
I like coming back to watch the old videos from time to time. But I remember watching this video without any problem with the audio. Is YouTube muting certain parts of the video?
To bad u gota mute or YouTube mutes certain parts of the video
There's no sound at 6:07
the other guy is doing robin's crane kick from teen titans go
13:03 no disrespect but, that's Goku's stance
i wanna call the kick roundhouse drill or something (me realizing that this is a terrible name)
Mikey looks exactly like me except I don't fight at all bruh
Bro I can't even hear most of it
there is so much redacted audio
season 2 lets goooo
I love how this dude says the n word so normal like any other word and doesn't get demonetized
Tokyo Revengers in 6 words: Black Air force Energy the Anime
the sound cutting out  is a pain but the video is great
@cj Dachamp what happened to the audio in some parts is my yt borked
Suggestion: A video on Anos Voldigoad. Dude is so deserving of blackforce energy. Character is ridiculously broken in the most fun way
I thought Mikey was a gir at first 😂
Where can I find this anime

Wait until the second season comes out, he’s gonna have to make a whole building for Taiju💀
The kick of devastation
I want to make a quick comment (you probably won’t see it) to point out that there have been some audio cuts in some of the videos.  Edit: oh wow, uh… I didn’t expect this comment to get that many likes!
What’s the music on 12:06?
The audio stopping is the copywrited music being muted so everything is muted
Truck kun 😂
Yo, CJ, the audio sometimes cuts out from the video. Not sure if its my phone but something's up
For anyone else does the video randomly go silent
Masterpiece as always👍
truck-kun returns

Please reupload YouTube cut some parts out for sound😂😂😂noooooo, i be coming back to this video every now and then
Why is there no sound when the was getting beat up in the beginning
Mikey's BAF1 too strong my phone is fear to describe the menace he emmits
Either my phone is trippin or this video cuts out a couple times.
Tokyo revengers is like a definition of its on sight💀

Children, Free Will, & The Tower of Babel cultural language divide delays Jesus Christ's reign as when he claims throne he is immediately responsible for judging all both living and dead. All ancients knew of the promised resurrection of the Dead (Reincarnation), virgin birth, and Judgement Day of the Righteous and Wicked souls; To be perfect is to be complete according to set standard, mathematical law of absolutes good vs evil. The true opposite of love is unholy selfishness, the epitome of pride is self-righteousness (unmerited value/unlawfully agreed).

0:00 moments before disaster

Mickey 3000 outside to inside kick is more accurate
Big Daddy Truck-Kun 😂😂
Moebius Moebius wait no no no MORBI-
Guys I just want to let you know that the Lord Jesus Christ loves YOU so incredibly much that He willingly died on a cross for you. He is coming back SOON! Nobody knows the day or hour not even Jesus himself (Matt 24:36), but He really is going to come back to this Earth. We’ve all sinned and need God’s forgiveness! But Jesus already payed the ultimate sacrifice for our sins by dying on a cross and rising again! Now all we have to do is turn to God through Him and freely accept the gift of God’s grace! Get to know God and His will by studying and apply His Word (the Bible) to your daily life. Establish a relationship with God. BELIEVE IN JESUS - that He is the Son of God who died on a cross for your sins (John 3:16-17&36), repent from your sins - remove sin from your life (sin is any evil activity such as murder, fornication, and lying. There are many sin lists in the Bible including Galatians 5:19-21,Colossians 3:5-10,2 Timothy 3:1-5,Revelation 21:8&27,and Revelation 22:15), confess Jesus as your personal savior (Romans‬ ‭10:9‬) AND be baptized for the forgiveness of your sins (Acts 2:38, Luke 13:3, Titus 3:4-7, Acts 17:30, Acts 16:31-34, Ezekiel 18:32, 1 Pet 3:21), and live a new life for Christ! Then continue serving God until you die (Mark 13:13), AND YOU SHALL INHERIT ETERNAL LIFE AND LIVE IN THE NEW HEAVEN AND NEW EARTH FOREVER (the new heaven/Earth are places where everything will be perfect and there will be no death, pain, sadness, suffering, or any bad thing)(John 3:16-17, John 5:24, Romans 6:23, Revelation 21:1-7). AMEN!  There’s never a “good time” or a time where you’ll “be ready” to get right with God. What are you waiting for? Get right with God today! I wanna see you in heaven (the new heaven/new Earth).
What’s the song called in the background at 3:40
Osanai got hit with that 220 kick.
Truck cun is in all dimension. Even real life

7:51 Damn,Mikey jumped on his face harder than Super Mario on a Goomba! crazy!

What's the beat at 13:30
Fun fact , Mikey is actually strong as a high class boxer around a-s rank ss+ is people like Muhammad Ali , mike Tyson etc , Mikey is weaker than people who have trained for at least 17-18 years of training
Put pah in the round table for being real
WWE type sh!t

I have a suggestion for the next vid: Ultimate Disrespect: Roy Mustang (Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood) and Envy. watch that fight. if anyone agrees, start a FMAB chain. And just seeing the DISRESPECT envy shows, he may have a chance at the round table...
I’m reading the manga where season 2 left off…and bruh, you wanna hear bout some BAF energy…hoooooooOO! I can’t even…
We need a round table of black Air Force for video game characters
I literally just finished watching Tokyo Revengers and I have to 100 percent agree with this whole video
why is the gangs name morbius tho
“And we got this guy jumping of a car and doing some wwe kick ass here”

This is still my favorite anime to this day
Middle school years are diff in Japan tho for instance takamitchi is 14 in the past and 26 in the future
they rlly in the hood fr
yo what was that sound effect in the beginning lol 😂
Yessir!! Tokyo Revengers all about that black Air Force 😈😈
Warning:this video is for people of above age 18 🤣
So this show is basically like Baki but they're built like Levi?  Lanky but Tanky
3:36 whats the name of this beat
That’s crazy that there only in middle school
i mean lets be fair...most anime was invented to properly express black air force energy. fist of the north star? black air-force energy... Mobile suit Gundam? believe it or not, black air-force energy... this stuff goes back to the '70s, and that's just the safe for work anime.
Beat up, it said they hung the parents and siblings they straight up took them off the Japanese census.
even the theme song for tokyo revengers Is fire as fuck
Lmao just so y’all know Mikey (blonde kicking dude) is 15 during the past lol
Doffy  deserves one. Doflamingo I mean
LMAOOOOOOOO
Imagine what Levi Ackerman would say about takemichis apartment🤣
It doesn’t matter if you time travel truck kun will always strike
This laughed the hell out of me
Dude really gave a warning when most of us already waiting for chapter 252 to be out
Bruh you should add Truck-kun to the round table bro he the real menace 💀

6:01 whats the beat called?
We need you to interview jiren ?
mikey in the manga has black tims bro hes a whole dif beast in the manga
Black air force gods, Draken ND Mikey
you are the best
11:50 tip for you homi while you on the streets. Never for a second think a knife to the body puts a man down. If he still moving hes dangerous and famous words from iyago, you would be surprised what you can live through. Thats why cops in usa go for head shots. Dont stab, slice the neck, if you dont have a gun. Pray you arent in such a situation with a knife only in usa, every one has a gun. Get real good at sharpening. Use the right knife type. Personally for where i live pepper spray is enough. I only have carolina reaper sauce ahaha. Dont get yourself in those situations. Dump your black air force friends. But if thats still not an option and specially if its more then one on one you will appreciate the tips.
The show was amazing but BRUH that nigga stayed crying like bruh shut the fuck up and FIGHT💀💀
Eren yeaaafer
Bro I swear to god I heard “whole ass” at least 30 times
Trunk kun: ah a worthy opponent  Train kun: our battle will be legendary
6:02

Mikey give big cock black air crock energy indeed his own class
Funny how pah-chin was the 1st nigga in the group to get married.
What's the beat at 3:47 in the background
Where do u watch TR
3rd time watching this classic 😭😭😭👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Now imagine if the webtoon/manhwa Lookism got animated  Just...t h i n k
For an anime revolving around absolute madman with darkest of night highest of skies airforce activity. Takemichi really do be acting like raggedy ass world balances which is probably called planet equilibrium or something because of his broke ass. But i can't hate on him any further though, he did just continue further air force activity by saving the people who are carrying the show.  And honestly bro, takemichi should've LEARNED HOW TO BOX INSTEAD OF PROCRASTINATING like a dumbass bro. I can't STAND this dude, remember when he did a whole puzzle in a span of a week or so? He could've done some fucking push ups or joined a gym in the meantime because oh my god.
12:06
Not the za wardo 😂😂😆
The ride or die homie with the pink hair is easily swayable the dude who pushed the protagonist on the tracks was akun himself not just that he killed dudes girl he is no ride or die homie at all he's a bitch lol
The kick he does has a name called the nuclear roundhouse
For the pepole that dont read manga il spoil so you dont down my boi takemichi  Hinas pop didnt want takemichi fucking with hina
"Da Wurdo" for the truck-kun moment was awesome.
9:09 WILL had the same walk Mikey did..geez I should of expected something was about to.go down
big daddy truck-kun LOL
Bro got hit with a nuke kick
3:26 💀
Mikey got the flip flop version of the black ones
The eagle roar 🦅 had me 💀
truck-kun is the black air force ship ment
Oh man, my sides... This video was funny as FFFFFFFUCK! yeah, so, the mikey 3000 roundhouse actually has a real name, it's called the enziguri and it's a wrestling move where the user kicks the opponent in the back of the head perfectly.
no matter how many times I watch this it gets funnier every time
bruh 1:55 to 2:40 was just a compilation of bullying takemichi
The mikey Air force kick!
Ah.. just like my middle school😀
Truck kun is the whole damn table.
Monkey D. Luffy also needs to be charged with BAF energy possession 👀
Japanese hood
Hilarious hilarious I tell you good show good show
yo this anime is in sane
Please add Stinkmeaner to the BAF roundtable!!!
I've always thought Tokyo revengers was some type of wack-ass hood fighting anime, but after seeing this. I'm having second thoughts
Dang I remember when Draken and Mikey first showed up and I assumed Mikey was second in command. He looked so dang goofy and on top of that his name was MIKEY. He SOUNDS like comic relief!!! Come to find out he was actually the big dog and I just needed thicker glasses....
This guy says the n word to much who agrees
pah really is a real nigga
Okeh ngl imma start a gang war once
I find it funny that draken is only 6,1 and looks 7,0 in the anime
BRO when you slowed down the car and put the face and the caption, I died lmao, shits hilarious
He gave mikey nike
#themikeyroundhouse3000

14:24
Tokyo Revengers are weak ass
I wanna be spoiled, someone tell me the end of the anime
8:58
u might know this already but the anime ends at 24 episodes and maybe a season 2? (idk if its confirmed or not) but the manga has over 200 chapters and honestly, its fire. like that type of manga u would reread for ages.
THEY actuallt thought they could escape the hol gods of car-kun truck-kun and train-kun.
its already called the nuclear  missile kick in the show lol
Yo why isn’t this anime just called gta 5
12:21
Heard of misfit of demon king academy Anos is just disrespectful to everyone

MY KEY....I COULDNT STOP LAUGHING AT THE FIRST PART OF HIM ROASTING THE SHIT OUTOF TAKEMITCHY
what is the beat at 3:35
pha a real one tho f for respecting this one
You should see that nigga draken during the Christmas fight in the manga. Nigga really took out 100 people in like 10 minutes😦
Train-chan and Truck-kun hunting people in the same episode? They probably planned that shit.😭 rip
You gotta listen to "On the Set" by Daddyphatsnaps. DPD is the King of BAF anime rap.
You just put meh on gang 🤣💯 luv my boi 🔒💚
When they only gave him a year man that was worth it
A black air force energy anime where someone actually is trying to oppose Truck-kun. I never thought that would be a thing but here we are
Watch the anime School Days and make a video on it. Please you won't regret it.
What’s redue of the healer and what happened
I don't like how long the anime took to pick up and that Takemitchy be crying every episode ngl
"Die yay! Murder yay" WTF BRO
If you make another disrespectful moment ep. What about you add gojo from jujutsu when he just put no effort in fighting jogo
We should talk about Akaishi’s forehead at 11:56. Like that bitch’s forehead be looking like a whole ass mountain
CJ!!!!!!🤣🤣🤣
You Doomed us all, Truck-kun has evolved and the boss music is Intensifying I can hear the one winged from my room
Wait till he reads the manga LMAO or the new eps come out

This one is goofy
5:49 the smash ultimate spike sound effect looool
Truck-kun's monologue scared me shitless

The lanky dude, his name is Hanna and his tattoos on his hands mean sin and punishment how cool is that
Story time I have a son who 540ed aka (Mikey 3000 round house) someone who hit my daughter and the kid was laying on the ground of the park The end
Copyright infringement it if pay attention to 2:41 it's say hinata so creator of NARUTO there some to sue:)

Bro we all know that truck-kun is never going to attack the more powerful anime characters.
Mikey looks like Meliodas
Truck Kun capped me. Fucking killed me
So much Black airforce energy that the almighty truck kun got relegated to side characters
If I didn't already watch Tokyo revengers before watching this,I'd be confused as heck
We start of the video with "So they just start boxing" They are literally killing each other after school, sometimes during school. Great show.
I’am  ready for season 2 >:]
What was the name of the song at the end?
Takamichis the mc?!?!?
Tatsuya shiba the irregular at magic high school is a professional of black Air Force energy
The laugh of Truck Kun is from Kefka off one of the old school Final Fantasy games
Bro lmao 2:25 at the video dude be beating his shit
She had about 12 seconds to get out of the car before she got hit while she was sitting there in the car the car wasn't even fast it's like Goku doing a Kamehameha and you just don't dodge it is not like it's going light speed it's not rocket science just to move
mikey said" f the puma side i don't need it to run yo fade"
Bruh! You had me at "ZA WORUDO!!" 🤣🤣😂😂😂
If you ain't smiling while beating ass then you ain't having enough fun with it.
My wifi password is give me 500$ for the password

You just gone skip past the fact that Mikey and Draken walked down the hallway on 12 niggas backs for literally no reason 💀😂
3:02 some major Re:zero flashbacks
TRAIN CHAN DOES IT AGAIN
Truck-kun a menace🤣
I'm pretty sure Katzutora called the "Mikey 3000" the "Nuclear Missile Kick"
2:17 aww hell nah man. what the fuck man
Imagine what would happen if Mikey ever put some shoes on.
Mikey be packing that Black Flip Flop activity...lol
Because of you I'm starting this series.
What’s the music in this video? At 6:04
the revive button did it for me! lol OMG!
TOO PROOF YOU WRONG THATS NOT A TRUCK THATS A AMERICAN  HUMMER 14:15
Good Show Good Show
One of the only things I didn't like is that the main character is always getting his ass wooped  and he is  a cry baby
😂🤣
what's that black bear from tryna watch the show
Train-Chan🤣🤣🤣
And this is where it started!
Escanor from seven deadly sins next please! HE Is Black Force Energy reincarnate
Just to be clear, truck-kun  is part of the black Air Force round table right?
You're so God damn funny! glad I watched this video
Just got finished watching the whole show. Now I can finish from 1:50
Truck kun is actually the most savage in the entire table bro
YOOO! You know who should be on the Round Table?! Shredder from 2003 TMNT (either the alien or the demon)!!! That man was COLD! BLOODED!
13:22 dom toretto in middle school be like
It's like this anime was created JUST for your review. Everything suits up perfectly
The only reason i dont like Tokyo revengers is bc they look like children.
Truck kun
To Truck-kun needs to get the heck out of here lmbo
You know Truck-Kun is a real OG when he used Za wurldo just to monologue.
The hell bell theme was perfect for this.
I watched this shit in one day
The dude Draken wasn't walking. Mufuka was GLIDIN' across the ground. Smooth ass animation right there, bruh.
Train-chan is coming for truck-kun's body count.
10:07 SHIT N**** THAT WAS WORTH IT *INSERT LUFFY TUMBS UP HERE* RESPECT MUSIC 🎶
Yo 1205 is where it’s at lol
Anybody know that song that plays at 13:28 I heard it b4 but i forgot what it was
None of Truck-kuns vessels are in this domain 💀💀💀
Plot twist: this guy is actually saitama watching anime lol
You gon' stop with this "Truck-kun" shit lmfao!
Da truck of evil is back
Truck kun is on demon time
I feel as though if peh had of been in ash lynx's gang and he did that he would have been dead
Yes. I am the type of nigga to watch clips and shit of an anime I haven't watched then watch it. I am immune to spoilers. fear.me.
You should call the Mikey kick  The black air kick
I LOVE YOU MIKEY AHHHHHHH SOGOOOIIIIIIIII 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Love these videos
Is tokyo ghul tokyo revengers
Using boondocks music was GENIUS
Mikey's kicks got a name
I mean. Homie should really feel lucky mikey didn't rock the geta or else he isn't getting a revive, he got isekai'd by sandal sama.
Nah. Not truck kun. Truck sama. Put some respect on it.
I'm so confused are they actually in middle school? Or high school and it was a miss translation of sorts? Because if they are actually in middle school? They don't even look like middle schoolers half of them😭
Big Daddy truck-kun
But like....."grandaddy long legs"
Truck kun my best friend killing all the girls 🗿
I accidentally skipped episode 1
No second thought I’m subscribing now
Mikey’s kind a like the meliodis of Tokyo revengers
Bruh thumbnail crispy asf
Omg the music when mikey and drakken pull up thats how you know they sone real black air force users
Ima call Mikey's roundhouse the 180 Dropadoodle
The fact that Mikey did his 3000 roundhouse with nothing but some musty flip flops proves to me that he’s basically the Levi of the show.
what's that song bruh
14:32 good show good show
Truck-kun at least took care of kisaki
redo-ed of the healer, im laughing soo hard
Let's call it the drill kick.
Yoooo why you say Whole ass 2 billion times in one video like Really new word alert time to get a new one !
This is the anime I'm  watching
This man is fucking hilarious
I thought this show was gay for a minute cuz of how weak the main character is … but shit got real dark real quick
This is my what boys do we fight each other’s
Manga is so amazing just finished the entire manga up to chapter 225 and I'm now waiting for new chapters pretty good
Tokyo revengers aka reverse ghost stories dub
pah gonna come back next season built like all might
ayo i have a theory, you see how the main character can travel through time, suppose that foureyes can do the same thing, because dont youll realize even when the main character try stop something foureyes always have to be the one involve and still some how find a way to get what happen in the past a reality when they travel back in time. and even through all that how does a goofy looking foureye nerd turn into someone savage and someone who always have power when they come back from the past.
At this point I feel like takemitchy is just living in Purgatorio the dude died and god wants to force him to make things better when it only gets worse.
its mine to bro
Tokyo revengers is my favorite anime
It’s the random eagle 🦅 sounds that be having me weakkkkk 😂😂😂
is it me or the pink hair dude that always smile reminds me of meliodas
Baki but not muscular men
@CJ Dachamp have you ever consider adding this for a new concept. Avenger Level Threats: People that I consider to be a rival for the Roundtable of Black Air Force Activity. I can think of a few like Light Yagami, Hendrickson, Cell, Killua, and Lelouch Vi Britannia.
This show was totally soemthing else lmao
Bro truck make the table
im so happy i found your channel this shit was hilarious ive been tryna find your channel for atleast a month and a half
I love this my new fav chanel
What is black air force
I keep forgetting that these kids are in MIDDLE SCHOOL bro 😭
This anime is great and the manga is just dope.
You all relies middle school is high school for Japanese guys right
this show is really bad i dont know why so much people enjoy it
Such a fresh anime imo
7:48
hahahhahahahhahahahahah
5:32 anytime you see a short chill guy in anime…DONT PISS HIM OFF (I repeat) DONT PISS HIM OFF!
I know everyone says this but the manga goes SUPER black air force one…. It’s so good and worth the read if you all have time.
*goes in a fight *180° kicks the hell out of Kiyomasa *refuses to elaborate *leaves
Ive got a couple amvs on my channel I think yall would like come check em out if you have the time
I watch this single video way too much but still love it
Amazing how everyone in the show is the goat, except the protagonist, like damn
14:12 Bro that ZA WARUDO broke me😂😂😂 the setup was so perfect,  the execution and payoff were just top tier😂👌
As an anime fan I am hyped and am seriously considering picking this show up. But as someone who works with kids Im kinda horrified, like WHERE tf are these kids parents???
Add rimuru because he's King of drip because of manga
just putting it out there but if these Kid's are Black Air Material then the Entire E-Class from Assassination Classroom are as well
mikey is like shanks but in tokyo revengers
Wait who got redo the healer 😱😱😱😱 Someone please clarify
I got a name for Mikey’s kick  “Delinquent Nuclear Drill”
bro Kisake is literally truck Kun himself https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmrbCUlibMw
1:08 I approve this round table
I watched the animé and honestly I think mikey is trash
Censoring the fights in this anime should be a felony
Spoiler alert        Draken is actually an absolute unit. He got shot 3 times and was still talking to takemitchi like no shit happened. Only when he collapsed after like a minute, they realised that Draken was gonna pass away now🥲
Mikey wouldve been a better main character than Takemichi. Mikey still an important character but all Takemichi do is get his ass beat, he really give off more beta energy than Naoto Hachioji
Hey just say in the series have now ended from what I’ve heard because I have not seen another episode in while
🤣🤣🤣🤣 this anime is trash 🤣🤣🤣 bunch of kids fighting and calling themselves a gang 🤣🤣🤣🤣
We need exhibit b
14:30  So u have summoned me

8:20  Ironically, Pah was the first one to get married lol.

The ishikai sending machine for truck kun is funny as hell
Where part 2
Exhibit B is gonna be crazy LMAOOOOOOO
What the song @13:30, I forgot 😭
Bro gotta have the best voice over/commentary ever😭🔥
when he said "man these little kids these days out here getting these black  forces early as hell" i immediately laughed so hard that i had to drink  three bottles of water
Well,Im just glad someone knows what kick Mikey used.
My guy where is the 2nd part
I haven't seen Tokyo Revengers but this makes it seem similar to Erased
So i see no one is gonna talk about how he paused on baki and he had a menace ass smile
Let's put in Kazutora Hanemiya from Tokyo Revengers, for the various grievous offenses he committed such as breaking the legs of his two closest advisors, beating up the ref of the Valhalla v Toman fight, beating mikey with a metal rod, etc.   If we go based on the manga then all of the divsion captains should have a seat at the Black Air Force Table, although the Tokyo Manji Gang itself is literally just a gathering of the most black air force activity. It's just a competition to see who has the most black air force energy tbh.
Tokyo Revenger = Final Destination, Truck-Kun Edition
what anime website?
Mickey: human kid buu
You summarized the show so good that we need a part 2
it wasnt pahs friends girl it was his girl
Bruh that jojo reference at the end was fucking fire, truck kun got full black airforce energy on overdrive
Shoutout to Baji. He's a real one

You got to get my man Akabane Karma from Assassination Classroom.  Thus guy goes hard on everyone in the series even the overpowered killer alien teacher.

You need to start putting the instrumentals in the damn description shits be too tough ‼️😭
As a bleach londed white guy with only 2 generation between me and the homeland    Your "black" voice is both on tight and hilarious. Never stop these videos are god damned oustanding.

Tht xxxtentacion audio clip of him beating tht dude yo I love ur videos bro u got everything I need 😭😭😭💯💯💯

The anime season is over we need the rest bro
Right, now do king Bradley, my man was clapping everybody in fmab.
Bro I needed you for something to watch
14:17
Do some more ;-;
This show has so much black Air Force energy it's on HBO
You gotta I’d part 2 now
Bro I just realized I have the same haircut as Mikey 😂
My favorite anime rn is High Rise Invasion
Fun fact: I recently found out that the author Ken Wakui inspiration for making Tokyo Revengers was because he use to be in a biker gang.
Time for u to make pt.2
P,
Tokyo revengers is basically about some hopeless dude that travels back into time to save his girlfriend and his friends by handshaking his dead gf's brother.  ever since I was little, i was always scared of trucks since movies and shows that for some reason the trucks always cause mass genocide. I'm still kinda scared bro  (edit) tokyo revengers is kind a long. If Mikey wore proper shoes and clothes, tokyo revengers would have been done in a few episodes. The fact that Mikey can kill someone with SLIPPERS and NOT GOIN FULL ON, it just makes a point that Mikey has 100% Nike black airforce energy
@Cj DaChamp no rush or anything but is part 2 coming out soon 😁🙏
I read the manga and found out there's an anime, bro this is what I'll spend my free time watching once I've read the entirety of the final arc cause it's 🔥🔥🔥
I've also recently gotten obsessed with this show/manga and damn, it's a heart wrecker. Love the energy you bring to this recap! Truck-kun is indeed a menace.

Who's the girl on the bottom left and the guy top centre with a red cape on the round table
i think in the show they reference Mikey's kicks as nuclear kicks
I wuddnt even mind if truck-kun gets a anime 🤣🤣🤣🤣 yooo make this a trend so it cud happen 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

This is a lesson on how to beat tf out someone part one
That nigga Truck Kun is a menace he don’t even got his own anime and has more bodies than most villains

Just can't take it seriously, everytime I remember they in middle school or freshmen
Show's been fantastic so far. It's savage, funny, and absolutely depressing all at once lol
Imagine getting jumped by a bunch of kids in gangs or cliques, then seeing a short dude that's the leader, his 2nd in command kicking somebody, then all of a sudden that said leader befriends you.   Talk about a clusterfuck of a day.
the intro is great with no context
I subscribed once you hit draken with the Phoenix down, I was sold after that...  Tho I started with Yujiro Hanma my fav, and then seen the truck kun vid and now this Tokyo revengers exhibit A! Now I gotta watch every vid under black airforce energy lol
#mikey 3000 roundhouse
Now we know a person from touman drives truck kun too much black force energy.
(manga spolier waring!) only good thing that truck-kun  did in Tokyo revengers was killing kisaki  ! so I only love him for that.
Eyyo, does anyone know the name of the song at 5:57? Thank you 🙏🏽
Kick name"Temple Toppler"  Since he hit and grounded the dude by his temple
He got dropped by a kick when the nigga wearing flip-flops nigga mikey a god he nice as hell though

epsiode 22 is realsed
I'm currently obsessed with TR and this is the funniest fucking summary of it that I've ever seen. Not a single lie or exaggeration of the collective feelings and energy this show invokes lmao.

14:10 Oh my GOD THIS NIGGA TRUCK-KUN IS A MENACE😨😨😨 if he was on my mans… I would NOT. SPIN.
He broke his neck 😂😂
The English dub title of this anime should be Black Airforce Energy in Tokyo because they wildin' out💀. I had to Google what the age range is for Japanese middle school because them boys look 20+++ with motorcycles and gang uniforms. I have to keep reminding myself that they are supposed to be in middle school.
this is the most entertaining yt video ever
Bro your video made me watch the whole series in 2 days

Shout out to Pah

It's funny because are these even middle schoolers😂😂😂i
I remember watching this episode it was crazy
BROO WHERE THE EXHIBIT B
It was sooo much smoke
Pah obtained succesfully the n-pass
Mikey deserve to be a tekken 7 character 😀
Looks like the devil commander has a anglalistic body but with OP FORCE 😎
he dont have the black air force energy he is the black air force energy
Can someone please deliberate to me what "Black Air force Energy" is?
afro vibes
Saying "Redo of Healer" needs to get videos demonetized :P
Truck-kun is a menace!
Pah knows how it feels when you the coolest, but the ugliest at the same time. You don't get no love out here.
Bruh someone please tell me which song dat is from bleach
This vid was about funny asf😂
Cuh you gone fuck around and make me watch anime!!!! Most def got a new sub today
Middle school in Japan is grade 7,8 and freshman 9 high-school High-school is 10,11,12.   Elementary is 1-6 Had to learn cuz shit confused me on why these dudes look grown
I feel like the animators didn't care if this was middle school bro.
I laughed so much😂😂😂..
Very educational gonna show this to my little brother in middle school
Oukuyasu
Waiting for dio to get a spot at the table
JESUS
Watched the whole anime and came back like I never left😂
Nah bro Mikey already had a name for his kick …not no Mikey 3000 roundhouse nah bro the name the gave his kick wayyy better …fucking nuclear missle kick …shit really do blow you tf up
This is the best part in this episode 0:00 17:37
Do zoro
The mfs in this show just needed to be beat by their parents. Maybe they wouldn't be such bad children
Go watch rent-a-girlfriend lol
When is their going to be a part 2
the MIKEY 3000 ROUNDHOUSE KICK
Gives me yuyu hakusho vibes
This video about the anime is better than the anime is.
So no one is gonna respect pah???
re:zero sound effects 😭😭😭😭😭
This anime is literally perfect in my opinion, my only issue is they had chances and coulda easily just killed kisaki but didn't.
Bro wait till you see who appears later in the series 🤣
Low key, the schools are funding Black Air Force Ones in the system 'cause how hood the kids are.
13:01 nah bro that’s the goku stance 😭😂
You mad weird for talking about some black force energy but adds a gay anime in🤨not talking about Tokyo ravens
Finally YouTube is recommending me some good content
Pah is a real g man stabbed the leader of the most heinous group ever and even took the blame for everybody.
Is this jojos?
MIKEY 100% HAS A SEAT WAITING FOR HIM AT TUE ROUND TABLE
7:13 ok i havent watched redo of healer what in gods green earth does he mean
Its hard to give that anime any credit when the main character cries like a bitch.
I love this
Truck - Kun always finishes the job
Mannn truck kun strikes again
Honestly. This new arc really didnt need to happen. But i'll take it.
9:20 imma need the ost name for the Mikey 3000 roundhouse kick
If only this anime had decent animation, they lacking hard
i would like to request the entry of takemichi to the round table, he is a unique case, and my reasoning for it is, think with me, he coulda endure a beat down form ZBrolly, yes, HE CAN, ma nigga has the balls of steel, he may not be the best with his hands, but my man can take it, and he can take it like a CHAMP, that is my request, a unique take on the table, AUDIENCE NEEDED
Had to sub after that
bruh u gotta do one for todou in jujitsu kaisen
Bruh the ending had me tho
I'm on 220 of the manga and never expected so much murder
Truck Koon no don't do it
Oh. Man. Gotta watch this show then.
Mikey kick is also know as nuclear kick
nice.
Can’t believe i got sold on an anime just off the title “black air force 1” energy 🤦🏾‍♂️
Slade deserves a spot at the table
Oh man the shit this man cj will be saying now about the episodes will get me dying out here  😂 🤣 😂🤣
Yo where can I get some Black Air FlipFlop 1's
Lol the Kazuya grunts had me rolling 😂
Back after watching the first 12 episodes, wild fr fr these 12-year-olds are some psychos! And that ending song is a whole bop.
If this is how the middle schoolers are built like, then those high schoolers must be built like titans.
6:03 song behind ?
Saucegay Beyer be in the black airforce round table one day.
Tokyo Revengers is a good anime don't get me wrong, but idk why people sayin ANYONE FROM THAT SHOW COULD BEAT CHARACTERS FROM BAKI. Like yeah some of em got that energy but that ain't mean they all gonna scale the same
Chill on the n word
Lmao not the Isekai sending machine 😂😂😂
As a manga reader I can confirm that Tokyo revengers is the main source of all black Air Force energy
8:24 that's what I'm sayin. There be so many tiktoks of girls fawning over Baji, Mikey, Draken, Mitsuya and Kazutora. But I ain't seen one for Pah.
Arrd I'll be back innnnnnn about 2 days
Bro ik its anime characters (including omni-man) but you gotta add red shirt tra rags to the table of black air force energy
Try out  Idante know only peace
One time in the manga draken like 100 dudes casually
You skipped the fact that draken took out twenty dudes after getting hit the head with a bat full force, got up, probably took out 10 more, got fucking stabbed and survived
Came here coz I’m waiting for episode 22 to drop and I ain’t never leaving😭nigga your channel is a vibe😂SUBSCRIBE
This to funny
These tekken sound effects are killing me
Nuclear kicks
i dont usually read mangas, but i couldnt wait for the show and im now caught up on the manga after 1 day of reading it 😭
The video just started and I'm getting mad young Berleezy vibes
Bro this shit was lit waiting for more episodes
This shit reminds me of Erased with the time travel n shit
I got a Tokyo revengers add from bili bili BEFORE WATCHING THIS perfect timing idk
mikey gonna kill Takemichi
I only just realized what happens with the foreshadowing of takemichi meant by he wants to take over the gang he and his friends will be the leaders of the new generation
Dom Toretto Vin Diesel 😐
mikey deserves a whole table to himself
Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
W  video
Saitama hella disrespectful too
tokyo revengers
Black force revengers

I read the whole manga so dw about spoilers
Truck-Kun uchiha
Yep I do get that black force energy
I really hope pah comes back and drops the shit outta kisaki
I had no idea black airforces had all this rep I spent a lot of years like all the way through middle and highschool tho wearing em and I’m a chill guy. I just thought they were a comfy ass shoe and black goes with everything and my school rules said like solid colour shoes
I will return here and edit this when i finally get to watching it
Truck-kun is the god of the Black Airforce Round Table
wheres the kuze vid
2:51 does anyone know what that song is called?

I need more of it
U gotta make a part 2 lmao.
How am I just finding about this dude now?! This man is hilarious!
This show got the most drip 💧
Every time i see him getting stabbed in his hand i get mad goosebumps
You should watch episode 19 and 20 best ones so far
HAH the irony is in the manga that (spoilers) kiss gets analed by OUR TRUCK KUUUUUUN AT THE END TRUCK KUN TOOK HINA'S LIFE AND ALSO SAVED HER
Aaaaaaand truck kun wins again
Gan'an from kaguya Sama is more despicable than Misaki tetta
Imma name that move "Mikey Norris"
6:28 gg Mikey gg..
Takemichy is immortal
NO BECAUSE WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY WAS GETTING THEIR ASSES BEAT…a medication ad came up 😭😭😭😭
my name is zeke weird
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-z-4-UeNbXY
9:23 damn Mikey doesn’t mess around sheeeesh
16:14 THE WAY U SAY IT😭😭
lmao I haven't even watched the anime, but this dude is so funny and entertaining I accepted the spoilers.
I love Tokyo revengers
The uncle ruckus theme is unbeatable
Bruh the end of the anime though 😓

That choke hold was what riley should have used on that big bully in Boondocks. 6:22 that crying really had me rolling 😂
Kick the crap out of him gave  his whole  neck scoliosis    I was on the floor😂🤣
I love how they are literally killing each other over some middle school beef
Truck kun the most black air force energy monster of all reality, even in real life
Can we agree that CJ is the official inviter to the black air force table? Cause all these people he be putting on the table are spot on.
Yujiro is the king

Ayo, could you please make a synopsis about spirit chronicles? The kid is fire.
I don't remember the last time I laughed this hard-
Mikey's signature kick is called the "nuclear kick" , basically  he  shows up to the fight with a 30 kill streak.
Bro, I’ve never laughed this hard in my life 😂😂 subscribing for sure
i legit just got to be a freshman in high school and this entire anime feels like everything i diddnt experience. Literally fights every day happened and iw as like - well shit okay. im that one  side character without any  voice lines and or comments exept for maybe one or two scenes that only gets seen at like the very end for a split second. ngl this anime s accurate to the main character 10/10 would sit on the bleachers again.
Man you got a keep doing this! I know you said when the anime finishes but I cannot wait that long, so when we get like 10 or so episodes you need to do this again it’s so freaking funny!
Did I stumble upon the Sparknotes of anime?
did you say the N word 2:23
You need to do another video with this week new eps bro lol

I went and watched it before watching this vid
I cant stop laughing at this
I watch more times than I can count. Good job I can't wait to see more. Black Air force Energy. Now I need a new pair.
Those blacker then black goku
tokyo revengers came out years ago though?
Tokyo revenges is a story  literally about the mc legit breaking the psychics of time trying his best to stop truck-kun and actually failing til truck kun got bored of his attempts and gave up but he already installed terror into takemitchy
If you like Highschool gangwars check out the webtoon Lookism, Gangster Reborn, and Highschool Mercenary.
i like this i really do
"Tokyo revengers is a terrible anime" - Young Defia- Anime Rant
Big Daddy Truck-Kun

Anime: May you all fear truck kun in the word of truck kun i say you all perish
Tokyo revengers shows literally calculation immeasurable in black air force energy,in 4 seconds of the opening you see  black air force energy you cant calculate this omniverse of infinite black force energy,for the one who rules over it is cjdachamp..thank you
You can’t tell me Doflamingo doesn’t deserve to be on this list
CJ meliodas should join this I mean 10 commandments meliodas

What is that hype up beat when Takemitchy is about to fight the opps.
I feel like it’s a question mark kick because he comes down on their head
Yo my man where can I watch this anime
6:25 and he walks over his head
Took me ages to finally be able to watch the vid. Boy am I glad I did care about spoilers this time.
Imagine if he went up to episode 20
Do a sukuna one
Did i just see teruhasshi??
If you think this is black airforce energy watch banana fish and baccano
3:30 bro was that a sound effect from Gordon Ramsays kitchen nightmares? Poggers
Ima need a part 2 soon
I dodged truck kuns attack one time but NO he came back and got me
Hit em with the mikey one piece special
LMFAOO

Love these videos so much
Hey bro for your Round Table of Black Air Force Activity I would like To Nominate EVERYONE FROM "BERZERK"!!!   I'M TALKING ZOD, GUTS, GRIFFITH, AND EVEN RANDOM NIGGA #9.
I would've done SOOOOOO much more to Kisaki than punch him in the face. Like, you had a part in my girl's murder. So like, I'm gonna stomp you out.
“i’m that nigga” God damn he went too far.
WHAT
Do a goku black black Air Force sypnosis
14:20 ain’t no way 😂😂
I think killua should be apart of the roundhouse table
Yeah we need that Baki episode bruh
You should make a video about Magical Girl Raising Project that anime is messed up
skyrim music noice
Bro that time stop and long ass one sided dialogue is perfect
bro the random 'DORYA' lmao
I legit thought of you when I saw this anime
Na mikey hit that moebius dude with the Lee Chaolan jawn from tekken.
I have so many things to say, but that would be manga spoilers. All I can say is don’t worry takemichi didn’t fumble with hina. It gets fixed in the future.
AGHH TRUCK-KUN YOU SON OF A- *(Ad plays)*
Im Subscribing after watching this video as the first video from this channel.
No one ive known had the name draken all i could find is drake but im a Draken and its more or les dray-ken for sounding it out purposes

Bruh they literally have a tutorial in how to do the Mikey 3000 roundhouse
Comment

Try killer bean at the black air force round table if you don't have much to do yet or if you have the time
Truck kun be out here catching bodies bruh
Yeo where do y’all be watching the anime gotta catch uppp

He reminds me of berleezy

Legit got covid right now, and your video is the first thing to make me smile in three days. May the gods bless you sir.
Zero cap, but Anos Voldigoad needs a spot at the round table.
I be getting heated cause takemitchi is so damn weak😭 he can't even fight right like bro wtf
WHERE THE FUCK IS EXHIBIT B!!!
In regards to the yujiro video, don't make it fast. Make it good.
Truck-kun will take a life no matter what. If they stop him from getting Hina, he'll take someone else
i didnt regret watching this video
in my school we fight  restroom  till blood  out boy
Yo cj bus-kun and train-chan teamed up in spirt chronicles
1:08 truck kun lmaooooo

Truck-kun strike again
I love the truck-kun part at the end
Bro please do a video on how Madara is worthy of black air force activity
Bro Ichigo needs to be there at the table of black air force activity he's too drippy and saucy my dude
Um

Can't wait for yujiros video.
That's the Mikey roadhouse kick 🤣🤣🤣

Yo dachamp in so ep 41 in the manga big daddy truck kun collected another body

The second overtaken started playing for Mikey it was already over for them
I love this, you made my day
3:25 why theres 4 of okayasu
Micky vs Levi who would win? (Levi has no odm gear ,fist fight)
When he said "smell like foot fungus" I immediately remembered Naoto picking up a whole sock covered in fungi in Takemichi's apartment. That man is fucking nasty. Forget saving Hina bro you think she's still gonna want you once she sees your house? Lmao
That whole car scene irritated the freak out of me. At this point he knew Hina had already died once from the group and knew this guy was after them, but it didn't click in his brain until way after the guy said what he said. And then Hina STAYED in the car while WATCHING the other car come to hit her.  Bruhhhh i was so pissed in this scene and plus that nigga cried way too much for me.
Draken and Mikey belongs on the table
TRUCK-KUN YOU B-    *Truck ad comes up*
What's the song at 8:37 I've only heard it in some sonic fan game

Mikey deserevs to be in the round table of black air force activity
CJ Idk if you'll see this but I hope you do. This is an omega level, fuck yo girl, step on your Jordan's brother who is not on the black force energy council. His name is Jin Woo from solo leveling. His existence is drip and him not being on the council is a crime.
Ayo cj DIO from jojo's bizarre adventure might be a good member for the roundtable of black airforce energy
Wait until he hears abt taiju
Light yagami should join the black airforce 1 activity table

I’m glad I watched the 15 episodes before this, it’s a great anime watch it if you haven’t
Love Tokyo Revengers 💛🖤💛
Why does so many people have josuke hair styles
Yo he should react to record of ragnarok
Tokyo revengers Is a show I liked but had the drop because of the MC, buddy was way too pathetic compared to the other characters, I think the last straw was when they were fighting in a parking lot tall dude had just gotten clocked by a bat and still fought off like 3 dudes, meanwhile the MC was just running around doing nothing then he trips in a puddle and started crying, I shut that shit off immediately bro I couldn't with that man anymore.
14:21 OHHHHH LAWD The irony. Manga readers know what I’m on about.
BRO WHERE TF IS THE PITO FROM GUN GALE BLACK AIR FORCE ENERGY VIDEO
Bro do another vid, the bloody Halloween fight is out🙏🏽
Prediction : Satoryu Gojo/Ryomen Sukuna will make the round table soon.
Its a dope ass show I just think its weird how they're in a gang in middle school lmao
Bro I can’t breathe l, maaad funny bro. You earned yourself a new subscriber today brother 🤣🙌👍
Mikey hit him with the Almighty Axe Kick. Guaranteed 1hitKO no matter the resistance, durability. It bypasses defense by 300% 😂😂😂
*speechless*
Dy f u tack kun
Let’s not forget truck-kun took out my boy, Yusuke Urameshi. Yeah, truck-kun is making a case as one of anime’s biggest villains.

Truck-kun got some friends  trucks just be killing people in aime
Bro episode 19 goes crazy
Afro Ninja approved 🥷🏾🤙🏾
truck kun has more bodies than ben simmons made 3 pointers
Do a black air force activity video on masterchief from halo
Not the re zero sound effects 😭
"Truck-kun", that was everything to me. Why am I just finding out about this page now.
sanzu, angry, smiley, kakucho, izana, inui, haitani brothers and so many more black air force energy characters are gonna be added by the end
dawg this channel the best discovery I’ve ever made in my LIFE 😂😂
please which song u use for backgrouind
Aye i know he ain't an anime character but you gotta add doom guy to the black airforce round table
Yo cj where do you watch it without crunchy roll premium
Mikey 3000 roundhouse just got its upgraded form: “Mikey 9001 team breaker” imma just leave it at that for now.
the one who was smiling is a girl, and she probably has the most Black AF energy in the show in teems of raw black air force energy*
The Mikey 3000.... Am out 🤣🤣😭🤣🤣🤣🤣
Tokyo revengers if the parents controlled their kids 🌚 imagine or takimichi not giving a fuck about hina
This video had me weak, especially when Truck-Kun showed, I love Mikey cause he isn't someone you expect to be cutthroat, much respect.   Also have you watched the anime Gangsta? Pls do,  Nicolas is a beast!  Also I kinda recommend Kill La Kill mostly for their fight scenes, Ryuko and Satsuki are badass.
Bro that truck is this evil
They on demon timing 😂😂
petition to make round table of real niggas and pah should be the first addition
I'm pretty sure they lynched his family not beat them up
Enjoyed this shit😂😂
Jigen on black Force energy table
My dude, this was well executed! I love this !
Bro u better make a new video for the most recent episode 🔥
I've watched this video like 6 times now...
bruh ppl be sayin that mikey nigga can beat naruto. They be trollin hard
Dat nigga truck-kun got more bodies then that Goku and Vegeta combined truck-kun collect bodies every anime.
we love u cj❤️ ur one of the reasons why I made  a yt channel 😁
wtf everything that is isakei is made from truck kun
At 14:17, what effect is that or where is that from
The thing that hurts the most is how I am literally The Pah In my friend group god damn
This man makes the best anime in 5 seconds but he makes its funny
Yusuke and Hiei are the kings of black force energy
Yo the Clone Commandos from the 2003 Animated Clone Wars was DRIPPING Black Air Force energy 😂😂
Can you make kaneki black air Force energy
Dang my boi got a tattoo in 5th grade bruh I wouldn't be alive if my mom found out bruh
How you gonna talk about black airforce energy without talking about Dio Brando 🤨
Yo, loving this show rn. it is epic, but we gotta get more diversity for the roundtable. we need to get some girls in there. Black Cover’s got some girls that exude B.A.F.Activité! Just a thought. Need to show respect to the levels of Black Air Force Activity everywhere cause the roundtable is an equal opportunity employer. Cannot wait for cjDaChamp to show us more stacked resumés.
When I watched it, and finished my thoughts were: “so it’s erased… but better”
bruhh in the manga the raped his girlfriend and hung the family i think
I can’t wait for yujiro’s vid. I bet it’s gonna be like 20-30 minutes long.
i like how they're in middle school but are 14-15 years liKE an American FRESHMEN OR Sophomore
If you want to watch this kind of thing but with real person you can watch crows zero
nah this shit is funny ash
3:18 lol just to remember where i was .
Bro this anime is like the erased anime but the thug version
Aye side question in minute 3:28 what song is at the background? I’ve been trying to find that shi for months
The warriors anime?
Yujiro Hanma lol
Do Netero, he's definitely got the energy
He better cover the scene where mikey kicks a mf with a whole ass body on him
Do Baki next CJ I’m telling you won’t regret it
I’m ngl Meliodas needs to be part of the round table of black airforce activity
the fact that you mentioned the marionette from fnaf makes it even funnier
Someone gotta warn him abt the new episode cuz the shit got the radars off the fucking charts😳
You better add Kisaki in there too. That man is a big brain mastermind 1000 IQ antagonist. Didn't matter what gang he joined he always got on top 💀
LMFAOOOO
Who’s back after episode 19?
Is it possible to add the evil Dino thunder white ranger to the table when it gets bigger idk about anybody else but that nigga delivered hands to Connor and Kira, then proceeded to say, “We can stay here and fight, but I thought you had a city to take care of?” Savage
Ngl. That shit with future Hina and truck-kun was brutal to watch
Episode 19 just aired, and I cannot wait to see what CJ has to say about this shit
I love Smiley
The sound effects and young link screaming got me dying!!🤣🤣🤣
✌🏾💗😂thanks I gotta get up on it
truck kun strikes again
Tokyo Revengers is a overhaul of the Anime/Live Action movie called Crows Zero and it's spin off film Drop. Check it out if you don't believe me.
Killmonger should get a spot at the Round Table Of Black Air Force Activity.
This is sht's hilarious man! +1 subs for ya! xD
Alucard video when?
Bro Yujiro is the king of black air force energy
Take a second to appreciate they in middle school and mikey and draken are 15 whilst takemicgi and hinata are 14 NO ONE IN THE ANIME IS OVER 15....

Tokyo revengers is the best anime I've seen for a long time
Truck kun catching bodies
Ok but now you gotta see if Yujiro Hanma is worthy of black air force activity
Its all mikey kun's fault

If y'all want to read a comic similar to this, I suggest weak hero on webtoon. Shit is insane
Apparently I didn’t watch all 15 episodes 😭
Lmaoo I can’t wait for the truck kun joke kisaki is gonna get🤣🤣
Can we just sit down and talk about how Mikey is eating that brown lollipop? That’s menace moves right there
Hey I saw you put Yami in the roundtable 😏, please do a video about Black Clover, you are so #cultured my guy
should I watch I'm really considering??
Can you do a part 2 please 🙏
When Pah is the chillest of your gang the overall black force energy is astronomical
Such a savage anime.
I need the beats my guy, the one when Mikey drops fight club goon
In all honestly I never enjoyed a vid like this b4 lmaooo
2:46 HE KILLED ME WITH THE TRUCK-KUN💀💀💀💀

I have never seen this anime but I could’ve listened to your commentary on it for hours lol you are hilarious
me in 8th grade 11:07
Jotaro black airforce when???
Truck kun will never stop asserting its dominance within animes
I didn't like it before but I realised the drip and and bro they are so big boi
bro you are the funniest youtuber i know
song at 10:50 ???
when the tenjiku arc comes out in the anime im finna buss I swear
Blackforce energy Magi???
Electric fountain I see you that's got be the theme for Mikey everytime he does Mikey 3000
Bro this my first time watching you and my god you give me anime berleezy vibes but on your own wave XD love it bro
if they really wanted to win the gang fight they would just get a gun its not like mikey can stop bullets............Right?
Jotaro is full of black air force energy. Suprised you haven't gone over him yet.
13:57  Omg noo Also whats the whistling theme
Mikey givin' off Meliodas vibes I swear to god!
Also, they're Japanese right? So like, how come some of these dudes have light coloured eyebrows and blonde hair?
Is it bad to get black air forces seriously tho bc they look kinda nice kinda wanna get them
This nigga funny as hell
The day we get a Shizuo heiwajima black Air Force video will truly be a sight.  Dude is the only person who survived truck kun wrath not once but twice
Not truck-kun’s scary ass time stop and speech😭😭💀. But nah, Tokyo Revengers is really the shit right now.
Pa-chin don't get hoes*Laughs in manga*
Truck is inevitable 0.0
ever think of lelouch
Truck-Kun strikes again LMAO! :D
Is crazy when I see this this kids look like they in high school not middle school
Yo you should do cobra Kai the the show
Cant wait for the yujiro video
Akaza and Muzan NEED to be the next Black air forces.
CJ:because if this nigga ain't breathing,she is breathing and we want her to breathe  Best thing I ever heard
9:02 when people hear this theme they know it's a wrap
They only in middle school
Boy he in flip flops and just did a 360 ROUND HOUSE KICK
sadly mikey is behind a lot of this.
They are in middle school
Do he got drip tho
Hmm, should I put another truck-Kun meme?
Truck kun is.a omni potent god
why doesn't he have a mill subs yet
Is that Zelda or Kingdom hearts theme song at 13:47?
Yessir
Cj the most black Air Force energy I’ve ever seen before Tokyo revengers was killua zoldyck from HunterxHunter (pronounced hunter-hunter if anybody say otherwise they can meet my 40 cal.)
I think you'll like the webtoonsThe Boxer and Teenage Mercernary. I also think you'll like the manhwa Rooftop Sword Master, the mc of it named Tak Seyoung has all kinds of Black Air Force Energy. If I was Takemichi I wouldn't have stopped at one hit when it came to Kisaki.
8:20 pecci if he got a neck and a clean haircut
I didn't feel bad at all for Hina's second death because could've easily avoided it if she just opened the door and jumped out of the car instead of staring at the vehicle coming towards her the whole time like a dumb ass. The whole time she was staring at the car I was like "this ain't a horror movie, this is real life! Get out of the car, it's that simple!"
I nicknamed Peh Pehthetic because he betrayed them and screw him. I'm surprised there isn't a manga about trying to get revenge on Truck kun.
You should try watching code geass and see if it has enough black air force energy.
The Whole show goes on the table
Nah all imma say is truck-kun is a menace in the manga bro like he different…different
A baji got that black air force energy
In my opinion it was a really good manga that turned into a really ok anime
cj... please read the manga. im telling you you wont regret.
Nah this video is perfect!! Commentary, sound effects, music, perfect! Too fuckin funny
The squeaky noise when he got shanked had me dead 9:55 😂😂🤣🤣
You could make like 5 videos of black force energy on yujiro himself not even the whole series
Gordon Ramsay needs a to be in the round table of black airforce activity
https://youtu.be/pnLacoazPr8 don’t miss all about the black force energy
@Cj Dachamp - My guy I recommend Saga of tanya the evil, trust me Black force energy is high plus the main character is female 😏
The pah took a year but worth it got me  Hey
Truck kun is back
nigga just cant beat truck kun
Truck-Kun... is everywhere.  Hell, find you and hell make your life a mess, traumatizing chaos.
i love this so much bc ur so dam funny 😭❗️
Anyone else realise Vegeta got kicked off the table of Black Air Force Energy Characters? CJ’s staying true to his word damn
Should’ve just told her to wait at that thingy
So who gonna be joining the table of black force energy
Joe rogan 😂😂
Missed opportunity for truck kun to say, I am inevitable.
bro can you do yujiro hanma
If kratos dont end up here im gonna cry
truck kun in this one thrice duddee, he always in every anime. This was hilarious though.
Bruh you better put a 2.0 for thid cuz the newest eps are crazy
The black Air Force Is too strong
That truck part made me piss myself i swear it was so funny especially when he said where ever I send you🤣🤣🤣🤣
After all she said:
SPOILER FOR TOKYO REVENGERS, its about truck-kun         The best scene with truck-kun is 100% going to be with Kisaki Tetta when that dude gets ran over lmfao, we'll have to wait until it gets animated though
Can you put Onion from Steven universe at this table PLEASE
Mikey 3000 Roundhouse

Don't judge, but i think Monokuma deserves to be seated at the Round-table of Black Air Force Activity.
Never saw this anime but CJ said they wearing black forces so I clicked the video. 😂😂😂😂😂
5:45 everyone got josuke and ,the hand stand user hair style
Gamba gamba
Bruh cj forgot one of the black Air Force gods jotaro kujo
I had this anime on my radar and the title of this video alone is enough for me to save this video for later and go start it to avoid spoilers lol
Need to make part two soon because episode 16 is wild
Bakis’s Dad is ridiculous
My issue with anime is although its good I takes me out everytime I remember THEY IN MIDDLE SCHOOL.
I swear little kids got the black air force activity on spam bro
dude baki the grappler is the definition of black air energy
We just gonna avoid the fact that they took takemichi out of class by whooping everybody ass in the hall and then jumping on the bodies
dude this is my fav video
What's the song at 6:02
Dude didn’t even finish his sentence and he got dropped 😂😭 9:19

Truck-kun is the real enemy
Yo if yujiro comin to the table he bout to be the god of black air force activity
I swear your the funniest YouTuber I have ever watched
They need to make an anime about truck-kun right now
Truck Kun is a whole menace to society 😹🙏
Car-sama: tryna stop my wrath Me: **Pauses the Video** Heh ez. Truck-kun: ;)

Jegal Taek has black air force energy to.
Bruhh you got to add Guts from Beserk to the table. That’s a easy one and a no brainer lol
Let’s just say in the manga Takemichi got the *highest* degree of black Air Force energy
truck kun will kill main villains
If you think this anime is black air force check this out from dps https://youtu.be/gvPxYyjqzjI
Look up Brock Sampson from the venture brothers
I died💀🤚🏾
You miss when Mikey was rocking everyone's shit
Though i know it's a joke cant help but tell you that yes (when i was in jp) there are mostly no people around when its class or working hours. I was only able to see alot of people only when in train station grocery mall or when its time for school or work (jp people are very much on the dot and routine oriented well most)
Fun fact:the creator got the tokyo revenger manga idea because tokyo revenge in real life is part of black emperor gang
Fun fact:there is a gang in real life called tokyo revenger and had the same clothes
This shit funny
cj is the black air force god he wished for a black air force anime it happend
“If you haven’t watched episodes 1-15 there are spoilers”   Manga readers: *scoffs* 😏
are you black
You should read "weak hero" on webtoon it will be right up your alley
14:15 my mans truck-kun really came back
Ayoo can someone tell CJ to do a video on dio from the Jonathan Joestar ark DAT NIGGA HAD BLACK AIR FORCE ENERGY TO ME HONESTLY
You should add the chuni exams Gaara he was on black Air Force activity
Not Dom Toretto having an influence on Mikey’s life 😭 I’m rolling!!
How big is that school
The Coma Kick lol
Next gang war is gonna pop off(manga reader)
We all know if someone belongs here it's Ainz from overlord
you know who just oozes black air force energy, Guy sensei
Does anyone know the song he played when takemichi chokes out the guy?
nah but i nearly cried that episode where draken got stabbed 😭😭 i thought he was for sure dead and he's one of my favorites

U funny asf this is the first time I’m watching you
Someone reply when exhibit b drops
Is my boy luffy gonna join the round table of black Air Force energy?
New move learned, 3000roundhouse flip flip
This is why NBA young boy should never direct a anime ever again in his life
you got to add itachi to the black air force table i mean he merc his whole clan
Don’t forget *they walked into* takemichi’s school and dragged him out
One day when that Yujiro video drops, it'll be his longest video, because all Yujiro does is a damn flex.
You should make a video explaining why madara is sitting at the table of black force energy, even tho everyone knows why, HE GOT CORNERED BY THE 5 KAGE AND PULLED A FUCKING NAE NAE ON THEM WHIPPING OUT THE 25 WOODEN CLONES AND ASKING THE 5 KAGES IF THEY WOULD RATHER FIGHT THE CLONES WITH OR WITHOUT THE SUSANOO, that just free content right there my G
Truck-kun is like the god of death in anime
If this anime follows the manga itll probably be the best anime the past few years
I mean even tho they getting they Ass beat they still real niggas 😂

I thought there was more but man the video ends
Thanks for putting me on bruh
Beerus had some disrespectful moments he flicked goku
He did pah so dirty when he was the [ SPOILER WARNING] only one that got married in they future 💀
If only he read manga he'd know the king of Black Air Force Activity is Sung Jin-Woo
Ayy idk if you know homie but did you check out the next two episodes? Bro they did my dude Mikey dirty
Cj I respect your content to no end bruh always A1 but I got a small beef with something you omitted from exhibit A: tell me why you didn’t talk about when the main character stoop up to Mikey and was ready to die for his chick against the two BAFG’s who threatened her. Like he knew there is death at this door and he is pounding on it fearless. Mikey actually respected him more
BOY... BOOOOOOY!! Tokyo Revengers is my shiiiiiiiizz!! That black air force energy is strong AF!! I'm loving this joint!
Truck kun came in with HELLA black Air Force energy in this show
Anime is irregular at magic high
Cj I found some one who stopped truck kun
Read the manga its on the last arc
I love when the gang pulls up and he plays the sound clip from yung bratz
They way my mans fell out after that choke hold made it look like LR gohan win screen😂
Yo Cj watch durarara shizuo is all black Air Force energy 👀

I nominate bra from dragon ball universe 16 to the round table of black airforce activity. She crazy af but she also gives no fucks. Hot af lowkey.
kisaki is probably my favorite manga villain cause in the anime he hasnt done much yet
In the Manga they be having black sir force v2 energy
I believe that Zoro needs to be on the table
I cant wait for yujiro Black Air force Activity vid🔥🔥
Yo Cj, your edits are legit!😭😭😭 Thank God I found this video. Made my whole day

When it said DIE MURDER YAY MY AS WAS LAUGHING
🤣🤣🤣🤣
No joke bruh Kisaki reminds me of Donquixote Doflamingo from One Piece.
gotta remember they messed up pah friends and friend's gf
This video earned a sub, most entertaining and hilarious 17 minutes and 37 seconds of my life man
See, they fucked up...they think Kisaki is behind everything. When really, we all know Truck-sama is the mastermind.
Bruh the next episode... Dafq..
When he voise truck kun does it sound like wonder of you a little
cj when is ur anime dropping
CJ you needs to read the Manga broo😭
Maybe u should put boruto on that table too just because of ep 207
When kids are play fighting  0:07
yo i need to watch this anime tho
Truck kun is insane
I literally just noticed the last four letters in cjdachamp's opening spells ight
Every time I see takemichi he always crying over some dumb shit bro
There were so many twists in this video😰
I think we just need a table for the top black air force alliance.
Name it the flip-flop kick
How did everyone get into start watching TR? I legit just saw the cover art on an anime site and there was 2 episodes outs and now im hooked. I mean like comment, I really wanna know lol
This is going to beTakemichi villain back story
Toko revengers hits harder than my dad's belt
Can we get this video but when Mikey jumps we get the tick tock tick fly like an eagle music from space jam..?
I hate how slow Mitchy can be but best believe he gon save the day...somehow
Bro do baki for black Air Force energy bruh watch that shit
idk if its a song or soemthing but at 3:22 whats the song?
The Re:Zero respawn tone had me dying at 3:10
Yugiro Gonna have a whole 1 hr special
CANNOT WAIT for the KING of Black air force activity and my favorite anime/manga character of all time GOATjiro Hanma
Kisaki is Truck-kun made flesh
So this shit basically like the warriors but they kids
Bruh i watched this video at least 3 times a day and its still a banger
You gotta thro mustang from fma on the list 💯
My  g truck-kun  is the worst Isekai machine
If I was the main character with this backstory and I was a weak bitch I’d break the 4th wall and kill the writers
Truck-kun the celestial menence lol
I started watching cause if you and im caught up now, favorite new gen anime no cap
The anime is so crazy that's why i love it
Truck-kun will return for another body....
Where to watch ??
If comethazine had a anime
Bro this the recap that we need in anime 😂
Haven't seen this anime but when the dude beat up his family, goddamn that made my blood boil.
Crescent moon kick
Why isn’t Goku Black in the round table? He don’t get a chance?
"The MICKEY 3000 ROUNDHOUSE"  BRO I'M DEAD LOL 😂😂😂😂😂
Anime of the year type beat
Craziest part of him getting beat with that bat til dark was it’s the middle of summer... they was there til damn near 9 smfh 🥴😂  Also why is Levi Ackerman not at this table yet??!
Mark my words,          I feel like kisaki is the type of guy who is super super super street smart and knows how to use everyone, but can’t handle himself, so he will probably die some stupid ass way. For example, he might die drinking water, hit by a car, accidentally stab himself
Big daddy Truck-kun
just read the manga for exhibit b    love the video
Me as the manga reader, as the story is getting crazier and crazier ,HELL YEAH bro even they are wearing crocs or skechers , the black force energy is still there lmao
This man deserve 100 million subscribers my guy
This man deserve 100 million subscribers my guy
PUT MIKEY AND DRAKEN KUN ON THE TABLE🤣
0:30 he gave caiyou a hairline btw caiyou a bitch he don’t deserve that😂😂🤣🤣
Man said yeah in shit
I’d like to suggest some people: Jotaro Kujo (JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure) Beerus (Dragon Ball) Dio Brando (JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure) Izaya Orihara (Durarara) Geese Howard (Fatal Fury) Micah Bell (Red Dead Redemption 2) Kratos (God Of War) Vaas Montenegro (Far Cry 3) The Man With No Name (The Dollars Trilogy) Angel Eyes (The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly) chimpanzees wolverines honey badgers hippos
Reminds me of weak hero kinda

💀 bro this too funny
Things i've learned while watching Tokyo Revengers:  Yellow hair = 100+ strength, 100+ kickassery, 100+ fashion
I NOMINATE😤😤😤😤  PAIN☔️ ⭕️BITO ITACHI💔 SASUKE💜 AND BLACK  ZETSU🌚 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 FOR THE BAFE HQ 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 NOBODY FRM NARUTO DESERVE IT MORE🤣🥴
We need to add Killer B to the table. Just watch the battle with Sasuke, Karin, Suigetsu and Jugo. He also gave Minato the business and mollywhopped Kisame
Truck-kun will always be animes biggest menace
I swear, you literally kill me when it comes to these vids no matter what mood I’m in💀
No one can escape truck kun
This has been in my recommended since this video came out
1st off great review Tokyo Revengers is my weekly must watch rn, I can’t wait to see part 2. And 2nd  if you don’t mind I would like to recommend Rimuru from Reincarnated as a Slime for the round table of black force energy. He somehow makes everything wholesome despite the fact he can easily Nerf almost anyone. If you watch up to season 2 pt 1, I don’t think you’ll be disappointed
Anybody know the background music @ 1:22 in the video ?
I FORGOT THEY WERE WHOLE AS KIDS 💀🤚
Hood/Gangster anime’s are more entertaining then your typical Shonen anime…
Omg I had to come back to watch it for a third time
I feel like omni man got triple air forces on then tyoko revenge
Flip flop addition
💀
Yeah I can’t wait for Yujiro
Black Air Force energy thru the roofff
Where is the Baki video damnit.
We need  Meliodas on the table
tokyo revengers is just disrespect its so good
i watched this twice
Wait so you’re telling me that to ancient deities both got a kill in the same day sounds like they teamed up
Im just waiting for tenjiku to get animated, bros gonna need a whole video for just one arc
That Chrono Cross music...
For those that have ears let them hear our father God is coming back with his son Jesus that died on the cross years back and I’m not going to force you to worship but just know that Jesus will love you till the days John 3:15 ►
This is really ghetto
i laugh at all your videos
Bro you got to do sun jin woo solo leveling black air force activity I’m telling you uzing black airforce activity
Truck kun can NOT BE STOPPED
what is the music at 2:25.
I laugh so hard
dude said dragon and nike
U so funny when I watch this vid in front of My mom she be laughing to 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂
Why the headband fit so well
Yo I read the manga and it gets even worse. 😐 (No spoiling intended)
i only watched up to episode 10 bc thats how far the english dub went to as of right now
Cj catch that train!
Just realized bradley from full metal alchemist  definitely got black Air Force energy
Truck-kun needs to stop
yeah the dude getting mad cause Pah in jail n the mikey/drakken fight regarding what to do ab Pah in jail is dumb since Pah wouldn't have gone if he didnt stab a dude, also pretty sure the dude that got stabbed still alive so it was for nothing since 1 yr jail def aint homicide time lmao
That truck got black force energy
remember "BIG DADDY TRUCK-KUN"
The true video starts at 14:08
Yessir I’m tryna see that Baki video
2:54 dude also got bullied by the ratatta god himself youngster joey now thats just f*cking sad
Bro gotta do stelio kontos from American dad
What song is used at 6:00 - 6:15
Can you please do the manga type this time please
trust me. C and D are going to throw you for a loop. it's a good read. this season will end on Valhalla most likely, pacing prediction, and boy... you will have some words
14:20 whats that laughing sound effect
No matter how many times i watch ur videos ill always laugh
The yujiro vid is gonna be heat. that man's...was black air force before black air forces were a thing
The « Bitch aaaaass nigga » got me weaak asf bro💀💀
Nitpick but It was pah who got fucked over he didn't do it for his friend
If anybody is wondering which anime 1:13 "this guy" is from, it's called Baki  And his name is Yujiro
Straight gold. Keep it up bro.
This whole anime about gang violence 😂😂
Shion's cooking have the most black arifource energy
rip to the 293 people that disliked this video
Ayo Ayo Ayo🔥🔥CJ this review 💯🔥 if not for your vid I might've left this anime out cause bruh 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 THANK YOU 👍🏽👍🏽💯
Mikey is like a chihuahua that can fight pit bulls and Rottweiler
Truck kun be so powerful he used za warldo
If someone is walking with confidence and I’m 20 man deep I would think he got that thang on him
Truck kun😂😂😂
Truck-kun is king of black air force mentality
Don would be proud bruh you got my like and subscribe for this one
cant wait till they get angry animated
most of them have white air forces
I ﹰLove it cj
Lmao so Tokyo middle schools are Compton on meth and steroids? These dudes vicious.
The boondocks music is a perfect touch.😎👍
Google minky momo. Truck kun took out a whole magical girl.  In  1985.
theres a manhwa / manga called "weak hero" the mc is pretty strong
Good looks bro. I'll be back when I finish the 1-15.
The truck need a video itself
Hanma vid finna be different
What i love is that in the manga, toman refuses to use guns and other equipments in the fight with tenjiku even if they knew tenjiku used it against them. They stick with dem fair fight and traditional way by throwing hands and kicking asses
I thought this guy was joking when he said truckun and his homies(tractorkun and trainkun) could use genstustu, turns out this whole show was an izinagi justu placed on mc to save his gf.
yooo your a legend gl and that anime is fire asf
spoiler:      truck kun killed the ugly ass kisaki but truck kun is so savage he did not isekai kisaki
that poor cute girl!!
If my homie and his girl , family and belongings got jumped , you know I'm throwing hands , Pahs a real one
11:15 Whats with Tanaka transporting in every anime, first his original Anime "Haikyuu!" then "Attack on Titan" now we have him in Tokyo Revengers-?
the intro hits every single time
Just wait for 40 v 200
new episode leveled Mikey UP in the black air force scale
1:13 Sorry if it’s been addressed before, but will ya’ take manga examples into consideration? Or just the old and new animated series?   Cuz’ some recent developments might increase/decrease his standing for the table, depending on how you call it, lol.
Mikey 2000 roundhouse  🔥🔥🔥😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂
Truck Kun was actually Dio.
Bro you saying exactly what I’m thinking the whole time😂🤌🏽
Mikey got black sandals so that means they are equivalent to black forces😂
manga isnt even finished and its on like chapter 200
I need MORE OF THIS!
They need to make an anime about how the mechanic defeats truck kun😂😂
truck kun
Mikey the flip flop god
BRO WHERE DO I WATCH EP10
Bruh I'm subscribing off your sound effects alone, the other video you added the taco bell 🔔 sound 🤣 and now Ylink screaming before the truck...im sold
come on yall 870k views and only 400k subs smh
Hear me out… Gordon Ramsay should be in the round table of black air energy
ANDROID 17 = BLACK AIR FORCE ENERGY
They hella big  for their age and they be beating straight cheeks
Not gonna lie, I'm getting so erased vibes.
There’s gonna be a gang name brah man and their leader is a girl name senju 😎
Well sir......sold! To Chrunchyroll

Meanwhile me in middle school: HAHA i the only thing i beat is my meat
Well i guess you never see crow zero
....Hey from the Manga here. I just want to see this guy's reaction to when you know what happens to you know who after that big thing if you know what I mean.         Spoiler: Truck kun is the really is the real villain of this story, taking out his subordinates to keep them silent.
Why is it truck-Kun at the round table
Die yay murder yay" b r  u h
The hidden black air force village  You're welcome.
Man id like to sub but you over here talking bout air forces
Lows mids or sf sky high
Its me 8:22 😭😭
Baki video 😈😈
i dont wanna be that guy, but that dude from Jujustu Kaisen.  you know which one im talking about
My friend says this anime sucks. … ima needa sock him for this one
no cap my guy you should check out yujiro hanma in baki cuz idk his black air force energy over 9,000
The real plot of this anime is about a boy trying to save his girl from truck-kun's wrath.
new ep was pretty good
he should do funniest moments this nigga funny asf
this video made me subscribe 😂
I'd imagine this is not gonna be in the Hanma Yujiro black air force energy video but if in the video it includes the scene where Yujiro stopped A EARTHQUAKE BY PUNCHING IT I will be so happy
Vote Mikey For Number 1 on the round table
Words not in these ppl's dictionaries: *Any kind words*
That rogue pheonix down
Truck-Kun next victim joke was so underrated
Crazy I’m watching this after the new episode
If cj posted more often he would be more popular than pewdiepie
Can we get a bcu?
this one of my favorite channels lmaoo
11:23 is a never pause anime moment
big daddy truck-kun
And people wonder why people watch anime

Truck-kun strikes again
Glad this sleeper anime is getting acknowledgment.
whats the music name at 13:58
nigga mikey hit em wit ohma’s iron breaker: kick
About time yujiro comes to the table
Definite respect for hina walks up to mikey and draken thinking they are kidnapping takamitchy and slapped mikey and dipped with her man. SLAPPED Mikey and told draken off
One potential anime for full on Black Force Energy is Darwin’s Game  No capping
Damn I don’t fw anime but I think imma need to watch this one.

Bro at 9:30 in the video what was that soundtrack called it was fire
Each of @Cj Dachamp is try not to laugh impossible.
it was a good episode of CJ
This anime kinda like the warriors
I can't Stop Laughing at This.  And I agree with you Cj 😎  I love watching Anime's that has Some Fight scenes in it and This is just Cool✨
When i saw yujiro I already knew it was a rap. Definitely subbing
Bro I hope he gets a power up or something.
There is no stopping truck-kun the god of death
Bro my names mikey     SO HOW THE FUCK MAN HAS BLACK AIR FORCE ENERGY IM THE DEFINITION OF NO BLACK AIR FORCE ENERGY
Truck kun one shot any universe
Whats the song at 6:01
Look at they shoes.  These niggas got the black ones🤣🤣
I agree with CJ on this because like if I look like a spoiled ass kid and he walking with his hands like a gangster something ain't right but when you see mikey he is the reincarnation of Meliodas when he actives his black air force energy!!
3:36 can someone please tell me we’re I can get this beat

Fun fact: Mikey is called Mikey because Emma felt sad because her name was foreign in Japan so when they were young Baji and Manjiro wanted to cheer her up and named themselves Edward (Ed) and Micheal (Mikey).   But it didn’t really help because she started crying.
How bout you try watching parasyte the maxim and tell us what you think, but if you seen it my bad you ain't gotta watch it.
Watch jojo
OK YOUTUBE ILL WATCH IT
Still need OG Raoh there
I'm telling you Baki got the black Air Force energy my boy
I hope he also covers the original Baki seasons for Yujiro, cause the man is an absolute menace that he probably needs like a half hour video
YUUUUUUJIROOO
Why didnt she just simply get out the car???
Hey Anybody I and I do mean ANYBODY! know the soundtrack when Mikey Shotgun the fuck outta bruh face with the "flip flop gigga nigga knock!" ???? 🤔😭
Can you ether invite doflamingo or katakuri in the table of black air force activity or better yet make them fight for it

YUJIRO IS THE GOAT TAKE YOUR TIME!!!!! GATHER ALL THE EVIDENCE 🤣😂🤣😂
Truck-kun has taken to many bodies
Tbh give giorno giovanna a black air force video
So it's mf Baki?
Yujiro is literally the reincarnation of black Air Force energy
Still no Zoro, Kakashi and Hellsing’s Alucard on the round table, yet they are Black Air Force incarnate.
Also, I’d like to nominate Tanya the evil for having black Air Force energy
Can't wait for my OP BRO YUJIRO HANMA vid
Thank you for this. When this show first came out the synopsis basically said an adult travels to the past to save his ex girlfriend from dying. I had absolute zero interest in watching. But now knowing this show is about kids with black Air Force energy I’m definitely watching. Also, where are the other black Air Force energy videos  before Eren from attack on Titan?
Funniest shit i have watched in days, keep it up
Bro got me hooked from this
The truck-kun part scared me so much
I just love how Mikey can swipe you down to his level with a swift ass kick
0:10 YOU FELL FOR IT! THE THUNDER CROSS SPLIT ATTACK!!!!

Bro you got me laughing like crazy bruh, so entertaining! Plus the DBZ sound effects switching to Op to Naruto OST is everything. But Mikey is just that dude man, with his roundhouse kicks bringing all the smoke. Reminds me of the Naruto games that had Jiraiya activate "Bring Down the House Jutsu," and don't even get me started on his insane interpretation of Sweet Chin Music! Out here making Shawn Micheals, the legend himself proud
Mikey never uses his hand in fights he useing half of his power
Me being on chapter 217: Also me this whole video: interesting

Zoom radiates Black air force energy
Bro you are the biggest troll ever this shi is not the energy you promised at least not the MC he is by FARRRRRR one of the weakest MCs we could have asked for he has no character development unless we are count the “emotional growth” because there definitely is NOOOO physical growth he starts of weak asf and somehow managed to become weaker as the show progressed and definitely discount that emotional growth because he is a 26 year old man around a bunch of 14yr olds i would f****** hope hes the mature one overall I’d the recommendation of this anime a 3/5+5 my bad about the rant i was just so annoyed with this anime
I thought this was finna be a music edit to a tokyos revenge song

You should make a video on the Ghost Stories dub version.  That would be wild
Truck-kun is like: You think that car is gonna protect you? You imbecile this was part of my plan. The car isn't here to protect your ass, it's there to ensure that you don't escape the divine wrath of Truck-sama, you shall forever curse the day you thought that car-sama was on your side, now have fun wherever the fuck I send you to.
Ayo real talk tho Hina is bad asf 😩
OOOOHHH OK MY MAN WORKIN ON YUJIRO

The protagonist is the want to be that guy but not that guy pal. Trust to rush 2 experience fighters by himself. Not to mention the ride or die friend and his girlfriend died right in front of him and he gets no awakening. That happen to me I'm unlocking the mangekyo sharingan. I don't want to say he a pussy,but can't say u have black air Forces when u got some any old black shoes
You should read the manga
If i keep watching this channel i will never run out of good anime to watch
Mikey on that dom type stuff
bruh this shit makes it funny, i wish they finished the manga already
Afro samurai when
It's *minor spoiler* but in the manga one of the characters straight up brought a gun. And I deadass laughed for a straight 2 minutes. These are middle and high schoolers lmaoo

When that Baki video comes out🤭🤭🤭
CJ: “Watch it then come back”,   *Me who read it 😵‍💫
How is Dio still not a member 😭
You need to read "The Boxer", the main character, Yu is the definition of black air force activity and not giving a SINGLE FUCK! My guy Yu is a menace in every sense of the word, This dude has zero emotions and beats the life out of everyone he meets in the ring with no mercy. On top of Yu being a menace his coach is also a black air force energy user. Honestly Yu is very deserving of a seat on the round table of black air force activity. I just hope it gets animated soon. You will not be disappointed (Still continuing right now btw)
8:50 had me dying for some reason
idk why but the zoom in on his 'flip flops' cracked me tf up. lmao Big Daddy Truck Kun.

Can’t escape truck Kun 😔
Did anyone else catch the Chrono trigger music while he was talking about going back to the future
The whole anime is pure black air force energy
Cj is so underrated
Yujiro vid let’s go
Alright, mini rant time: Can Takemitchi just learn how to box like omg, you can't just run up on people and get ko'd in 1 punch. This man is everybody's punching bag! His own girlfriend said that if she was a dude, she'd be stronger than him, and she already knows how to fight so it's a done deal. Like niggas whose power levels are over 9,000 just fall into his life and kick his ass. Props for standing up for what you believe in, but for god's sake put someone else to sleep, man.
Mikey wid da black flip flop energy
LETS GOO 🙌🏽 that yujiro video is gonna be godly

14:12 funny asf😂😭
Only yujiro Hanma gets a seat at the table? You've been doing the research. If these kids in Tokyo revengers get multiple seats then the whole cast of baki should have a seat. Going to need a black Air Force energy stadium to seat everyone that deserves to be there.

Bro walked home with that Connor foot
CJ you gonna post on your TikTok
In all seriousness. Truck-Kun is insanely efficient. I suspect the Japanese government has been funding experiments to create bigger and badder models. The legend of Truck-Kun forever grows.
Didn't even take five minutes and Truck-kun's already stealing the spotlight

Pucci has Black Air Force Energy.
It would be one HELL of a plot twist if at the end of all the pain and suffering Takamichi went through to save his ex, she ends up being a criminal this whole time.
Yujiro hanma is that #igga
When i watched the anime before i watched this is was like THERE AINT A SINGLE BLACK NIGGA i wonder what would happen if there was 🤨
When is Yujiro Hanma gonna have a seat around the table?
Out of everybody in this anime, Truck-kun still holds the pinnacle of having the most Black Force Energy
Ayo? You trending?
this wouldn’t be black air force energy the anime without the menace himself truck-kun.
From the First black airforce energy video I knew Yujiro Was gonna be in the Future man radiates Black air force energy LITERALLY

SUKUNA FROM JJK PLEASE, LITERALLY PURE BLACK AIR FORCE ENERGY
As you progress through more anime, the phrase "we're gonna need a bigger table" ain't gonna die anytime soon.
One of the greatest channels on here🔥🔥🔥
Pah is the real one.
I have Black Air Force and I’m 11
I wonder how Terra Formars holds up. I feel like it has Black Air Force energy, but I'm not sure if CJ would agree.
If u wanna see true black Air Force energy is Crow 0 series (downside it’s not an anime) but they have a manga
wait Cj if u reading this, when your making the yujiro vid, pls put the part when Yujiro's dad came back from the shadow realm as a ghost just to disss his own son! XD if you readed the manga u know what I mean cuz like his dad was a MUCH  MUCH monster than yujiro, it was even stated by yujiro himself he does not even half the power of his dad, but unlike yujiro, his dad was one chill mf, but when he gets angry my guy took the US army by himself
Ayo cj do jojo
“The I tried to fuck in the karaoke booth” got me fucked up💀
Truck-Kun always folds his victims
Yoooooo you funny
Bro not only cause you fuck with tokyo revengers, the fact that you used those boondocks instrumentals I'm subbing NOW.
I am now invested in this show, Thank You
Mikey deserves to be the lieutenant of the black air forces empire because, he was disrespecting dudes in flip flops. Let that sink in. FLIP FLOPS!
Well damn Mikey ran their shit

you know you’re about to get a good 17 minutes when cj uploads
So truck-kun himself is the villain of the story. Because basically my manz trying to save his girl from truck-kun wraith by going back in time. If truck-kun ain't the black air force energy God himself then idk who is.

Top 10 of the World's Funniest One Liners  1. Despite the cost of living, have you noticed how it remains so popular? 2. Save the whales. Collect the whole set.  3. Eschew obfuscation. 4. They told me I was gullible...and I believed them. 5. I'm out of bed and dressed. What more do you want? 6. Don't steal. The government hates competition. 7. I wonder how much deeper the ocean would be without sponges. 8. Sometimes I wake up grumpy; other times I let her sleep.  9. There are three kinds of people: Those who can count and those who can't. 10. Few women admit their age; few men act it.    Editorial: Probably the most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com

Also, Yujiro kills Baki's mother during his first fight with Baki. CJ, please be sure to add content from Baki season 1 and 2 that isn't available on Netflix!

Glad they animated this they on gang shit 24/7
I'm honestly kinda shocked he didn't make it earlier cause this show was just radiating black air force energy
That Anime is Definition of black Air Force Energy
we gonna need a bigger table💀
Never mind
1. Truck-kun is the leader of the round table. 2. What about Mereoleona Vermillion for the round table?
Ong, I have been watching this anime since it came out and I can confirm its heat each episode has a cliffhanger and a good plot and there are a number of genres in it, not just action and fighting. Definitely one of my favorite anime as of right now.
"These niggas got on the black ones" hahahaha
the caleb sound effects always get me
Lol she thought she could escape truck-kuns grasp
LEVI BLACK AIR FORCE ENERGY
Just coped the black 1s
Bruh you know damn well once Trunk-Kun started talking I got to stepping
I been wanting watch Tokyo revenge but can anyone tell what website to watch it on
Black air force energy is the best energy
Can’t wait for the Yujiro video😂
If you read the manga you don' see a whole nother level of black airforce energy.
I never knew I needed a series so much
Truck-Kun was the one winged angel all along!
at 9:43 when mikey did that kick im pretty sure its a taekwondo move
Yes sir
I knew he would eventually have yujiro hamma at the table and probably some other people from show also
Nah that jeep San the the corrector
cj the most op guy in youtube........
I'm waiting for jotaro or the jojo universe
smiley my favorite character bruh, just off that scene alone that nigga became my favorite character. was rewatching that shit like crazy. niggas even made a 10 hour video of him straight smiting his shit

I know this isn't really anime but toph from avatar the last air bender like she can, has, and will drop the whole cast she deserves a seat
3:26 you know shits going down if you hear a thugnificent beat start playing
bruh i remember when i innocently thought it was a 12 episode anime....then Hina died AGAIN
So 2 final fantasy vii references, and 1 of them had truck kun as sephiroth. And he added one winged angel in the background. Sephiroth black air force?????????
I want more. Give me more.
“So then they all start boxin” You’ve peeked my attention 😂

The sadest feeling is when my mom got me air force ones for my birth day and it was white
Ohh man, this show was so good that when Ep. 3 rolled out I was like, "Nuh-uh, I gotta find out what happens next." and binged the whole manga that was out at the time. I normally never do that, but man... I had to for this. Takemichi is the singular most chadtastic, badass beta male to exist. idk if he a bitch, but he a real homie, and that's what matters most.
12:35 that fight alone made takemichi one of the best mc’s of this anime season. Popped off super hard
I have nothing but love for this guy and he’s heard anime reviews
Flippy black air force activity
Yujiro should be at the head of the round table he bleeds black airforce activity like a waterfall
Big daddy truck kun though 😭
so Japanese boondocks
You should do a meliodas  black airforce activity video
You should do baki its good
Dude truck-kun needs to calm the hell down idk what happened in his past but dudes gotta let it go

Truck-kun simply thrives off negativity
bro you gotta be the funniest person I watch. Love the videos keep them up
1:14 let’s go a fucking Baki episode but he should add raian Kure from Kenyan astute just looking at him is just black Air Force activity
12:51 I personally think that term is a little overused and generic. 8:14, 13:06, 13:13 these ones too.   But I completely agree with everything you said.   But at the end of the day, whether I agree or disagree doesn't matter.
bruh mikey suck in ep 14 i think he says something to takemicthy at the end  an after all he did he said something stupid and on top of that for 3 or 4 times takemicthy gets beat up and mikey stants there and after he saves draken he makes fun of him and cuss him out bro
"And we got the shit talk'n grunts...." Imma start using that. Lol 😆
Ima go watch the anime now

Takemichi getting bodied every single day to save other niggas to see his side bitch alive in the future, idk if hes the ultimate simp or not

3:35 What is the song called
This nigga Truck-kun a menace he keep taking lives
Day 5 of saying accelerator from the index/railgun series as well as levi from attack on titan should be in the roundtable of black airforce activity
I enjoyed watching it . Yo take your time on Yujiro, by the time you finish his video give us a warning. We better get a pair of BA shoes and kneel down for the KING 👑  He doesn’t have power’s but he is THE  STRONGEST BEAST of all humanity.
A if you watch that episode with the truck-kun you can see in the background he following them through the episode
You should check out the Madness Combat series and look at a character called Tricky.
"And treats this man like family"  lmao
Smiling dude looks like a male version of male mina ashido
Right as I was eating thank you
fr this is black force energy simulator
On all the kicks For one thing this is Japan karate is a thing and there's people from Korea there too so taekwondo  But the other thing is the concept of where your body parts align with the heavens and buddhism. Basically the feet are the lowest of the low bringing them up to somebody's head and kicking them is an insult. So they're literally just kicking in the face to style and add insult to injury.
Tokyo Revengers caught me by surprise, a revival of the delinquent genre anime mixed with time travel. It does both superbly. This is what anime/manga is about.
Baki dad is the  black air force energy
Should dio be apart of the round table of black air force activity?
pure black air force energy
Trunk kun said you try to stop me. YOU DESERVE PUNISHMENT
literally watching the show now and I love it
THATS RIGHT
I swear Mikey reminds me of white beard
Good Truck Kun

w vid
Hi
U don't need a exhibit for mikey and draken, just by looking at them u know thy mean business.
If mc wasn't a bitch I would love this anime
This show wouldve ended a lot quicker if these mfs had guns.
It's funny how we call em Black Airforce Energy Warriors when they've got white shoes lmfao
They be lookin like a whole pack of Okuyasus,absolutely horrorifying
This is what comes up when I search "Black air force energy". This show goes hard.
the amount of effort put in these videos are amazing. and CJ needs to do like an short abridge series or something down the road
lowing long vids
I love this anime and KNEW these niggas was fixin to be a table video. But the lead do just be time traveling to get his ass beat doe lol
Another banger as per usual 🔥
this is 10x better than the actual episodes
Ultra instinct shaggy versus truck kun obviously you know truck kun ga win
Niggas who didn’t see the last vid are probably confused cuz u snuck aizen in the table 😭💀
Waiting on that Baki video🙏🏾🙏🏾
Truck-kun claim body's and keep it that way
Personally I predict Mikey and Baji get inducted into the roundtable
CJ how did you do the deep voice for truck-k
it doesn't matter how much you go back in time. Truck kun will always strike. His destruction is inevitable no matter what. NO ONE CAN STOP HIM!
Cj is back with another banger
Truck-Kun back at it again 😂
I’m surprised DIO hasn’t entered The round table of black Air Force energy🧐
Imma just ignore the little brothers handshake 🤝 being some godly ability and continue watching
Sup
so that girl got isikai twice
Bruh truck-kun is the most dangerous being in the Universe
Anyone know the name of the beat/song 6:03
CJ: kid buu is the ceo of black airforce activity  Mikey: hold my flip-flop
14:15 i pissed myself laughing I can’t with these edits…. I’m finna make 100 YouTube accounts and follow this man on all of em cuz he deserves it for this S rank comedy
LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEETTTTTTSS FFUCCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, I KNOW MIKEY GONNA BE ADDED TO THAT ROUND TABLE HE'S TOO COOL NOT TO

Mikey been listening to too much comethizine and Young Boy
Akkun a opp on my soul
My nigga should be a whole comedian as a job job
Never slipping kinda energy.
Black air force action be like that
It's kinda crazy how powerful truck-kun is. Not only do these gangs have guns and knives, but they decided twice that the best killing method on a weak boy and a girl was driving full speed at them with a truck.
Youjiro needs a whole freaking mini documentary 😂😂 man just be standing by the wall and black Air Force energy homies is flinching
YOU DIDNT PUT YOUR SEASONING ON YOUR STAKE
Truck-Kun stay on Dat A$$
You don't know how much ive wanted you to make this video 🤣

You have no clue how big you gonna have to make that table
2:02 the fries kinda look like mogus
The black Air Force round table be looking good so how you gonna add toman on to the new round table
Truck kun said no matter what time period it is you’ll never escape my wrath

Zamasu needs to be in the black air force energy table

CJ funny as hell
What is the opposite of black air force energy? 🤔
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEES

Lessss goooo
Wait till he discovers Baki everyone has black air force energy
I dont remember the last time a youtuber makes me drop everything I'm doing to watch an upload honestly. I'm REALLY looking foward to the Yujiro episode.
Mickey is a prime candidate for the black air force round table
Can someone please tell me what song that is playing at 13:28
Bro takemichi had to fight a nigga with a shanked hand bruh
Truck kun never stops
Ngl ngl if you read the manga of it you wouldnt be ready to see what goes down
Tokyo Revengers and The Misfit of Demon King Academy are better than Assault Lily Bouquet, better than Redo of Healer, better than Rent-A-Girlfriend, bitch!
AIGHT IMA WATCH THIS AND COME BACK been seeing random clips but was like nawww... But one the Black Air Forces get put on em its OFFICIALLY stamped RECKLESS
I have been wating for this
Can keyaru from redo of healer join the Round table of black Air Force activity
Yk Baki is one of da kings of black airforce energy
Look left and right before you cross the street... cause truck-kun is comin to put that ass to sleep.
What is the Outro song
Dio Brando has to be at the round table of black air force energy.
It’s like damn, what did he do to make dem nigga so god damn mad. -Thugnificent
Bro if you make a yujiro vid that’s gonna be at least 20 different exhibits 😭bro has done too much
did this nigga call him..."m- mikey~kun?''
Truck kun
He is truck kun but I prefer truck god bc I don’t wanna sound sus and he is a god of destruction
I think it's funny cuz me and my friends was just talking about Mikey's BLACK AIR FORCE ACTIVITY!!!!!! THIS NIGGA MIKEY  BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF LIKE 15 NIGGAA BY HIMSELF BACK TO BACK
YOO Yujiro? Dude is the black force incarnate bruh. Especially if you saw the most recent chapter
I don’t think the table will be large enough at this point
The roundhouse kicked 3000
Broooo, this shit is sad, badass, and just straight up golden, and whoever seen the backstory of Baji, I hoped yall hearts were racing as fast as mine cuz fuckkkk mannn
anyone know the name of the song with the wistle
Damn you truck kun why won’t you just leave people
cj gotta put himself on that round table fr
Bro that phoenix down had me dead lmao
The ultimate black Air Force fight:   Truck Kun vs Mikey           Truck Kun solos
Fire bro keep it up 🔥 💯
Yo cj where do you watch some anime need the link
AYYYY TOKYO REVENGERS
11:23 What's wrong with his eyes?
Not even 2 minutes and I’m dying lmao 🤣 🤣🤣🤣💀☠️
Nah mikey on demon time
bro manga mikey has airforce activity 100
Bro wait till you see ep16 bro 😭😭😭
#PAH A REAL NIGGA
Yo
FINALLY YOU REVIEWED THIS ANIME
Truck-kun one shots
Truck god never fails to get bodies on the regular
truck kun calls his brother to do his job for him.
Black air force energy type beat
so far best new 2021 anime
heel yeah the YUJIRO VIDEO
This why I trust him with the black air force
early no cap
Truck-kun really have some evil black Air Force Energy
This anime is built like eren season four bro the black air force active is overwhelming
The Seven Deadly Black Airforces 🤣🤣🤣
If one deserves to be part of the black airforce council, it's Sato from Ajin. That guy is literary a menace to Society
At some point you gotta do a black Air Force tournament, there’s gotta be a leader of the round table.
Cj be like : when the anime is finished i will do another video on this The anime : 200 chapters +
This man is going to make me to watch Tokyo revengers
You’re going to hate kisaki even more when you find out why he’s doing all of this. I swear he is the worst villain ever, there is nothing good about that character. Rip to all the fallen soldiers go read the manga a little bit to understand what real pain is
you GOTTA get Dio in the black airforce round table
We can tell everyone in Tokyo Revengers’ hands are rated E for everyone
I might need to check this shit out if it’s something that interesting 😎
we gotta get drake and mikey their own video
Dam dam dM dam dam dam dam
The caleb city sounds 😂😂
truck-kun in the manga goes crazyyyyy
mikey wants all the smoke no matter who it is bro
I believe Heihachi Mishima has Black Airforce activity. Dude tries to kill his family members multiple times and evn threw his own son off a cliff twice. The second time was in a fucking volcano. He fights Akuma and SURVIVES and then fights Kazuya and beats him out of his Devil Form before he dies.
Can’t wait till Cj makes a death note video
Haven't watched the Anime yet
Knew you would get to this at some point; This is literally 'Gang Activity: The Anime' (*Middle School Edition). If it doesn't exude Black Air Force energy, I don't know what does. (P.S - Mikey calls Takemitchi his bitch right here in the manga. Built different lmao : 5:46)
you should make one on yujiro hanma he is a menace
Cj watch Tenjou Tenge, maybe it's black Air Force energy :) Edited: try The Idaten Deities Know Only Peace.
Where’s yusuke urimeshi for the round table
This vid was straight fire
yoooo u funny as fuck bro and your edits are on point
Dawg the manga is even crazier this is one of the realest anime I’ve ever seen 💯
OMG TOKYO REVENGERS IS THEEE BESTTTTT
Manga Readers Laughing Right Now
waiting for Tanya to be added to the table of badass
Amazing work!!

Yo‼️ Truck-kun in the god of black Air Force energy like he got no Chil.
Kazutora is a fucking MENACe
escanor got black force energy?  i mean he respects only ONE WOMAN and used a FINGER to beat a high TIER demon
Damn why have to do my nigga Paul like that 8:21  That one there was a violation of personally I wouldn’t have it
You're going to need a Black Air Force THRONE for Baki
We all gotta agree                  We all fell for Mikey the first time we saw or was it just me?
Can't wait to see that Yujiro video, Baki characters be wildin

This mane is valid
Cj you gotta get Ar Manga to help with the Yujiro Hanma video
The people who disliked will be hunted down by Truck-Kun.
When ever I see someone with the doflamingo walk I already know that nigga finna act up
Hell yeah monke likes this
Still waiting on Ainz (overlord) to go on The round table.
Imagine trying to give your friend a bike yet kill his brother who owns the nike
The new table is gonna need a lot of seats
You better give Yujiro his own table
CJ:if you haven't watched episode 1 through 15 you should click off the video  Me:laughs in manga
Can't wait for cj to put yugiro and aizen in the round table of black air force activity.
When I get warned for spoilers I really don't give a fuck cause I will just not watch it cause I think of it as bad as it trash comments it decide if I watch it not
today is a good day, since he uploaded
Sometimes I just feel bad for takmitchi
1# he smiled while beating the sh!t out of him 2# he jumped off the car like a wrestler and RKO them in the face 3# he has a MUSTY RUSTY APARTMENT THAT HE NEVER CLEANED SINCE A MONTH?!?!? 4# NIGGA GOT A MAGIZINE WITH GIRL LIKE " ah daddy more plz" 5# his ass got ranned over by train
Imagine If CJ from GTA lived in the Tokyo Revengers universe

Hello skedadudlers
honestly if cj made an anime he would be the best most black air force protagonist
Also upload schedule nice
Peh-yan literally becomes one of the best characters in the whole show alongside Chifuyu, Angry and Mitsuya but the way you roasted him feels like he has no redeeming qualities. 😂🤣🤣 Also spoilers :           He said Pah-chin is like the ugly friend of the pack but he's literally the only one who got married in the present .
bro yall just gotta wait or go ahead and see the manga cause truck kun aint dead yet. thats all im sayin
truck kun lol
Fun non spoiler fact, when Mikey first meets Takemitchy, Mikey says he’s his bitch. The anime changed bitch to friend.
Doesn't afro samurai have black air force
we need jotaro up in here too
Cj gotta have his own table or something at this point 😭
Bruh, when mikey hit him the the mikey 3000 roundhouse he hit him with his toe to the temple. He literally made the subconscious choice to kill that man
Truck kun said: anihalate by destroyed type quote 14:54
OMG BRO THE ENDING

If he don’t add Mikey to the black Air Force table ima be mad
Yujiro Hanma is next! Hopefully.
I'm no different but at least I have the decency and self respect to keep my place clean.

Me: waiting to find a don toretto meme in the comments section*
Jeep sama on a different type of time

You should do a video on rengoku that man is a goat
Remember that time Yujiro stopped an earthquake with one punch to the ground cause he thought it would interfere with a fight?  Lyke wat😐
call it round house no jutsu
Not to be mean but please don't compare Baki Characters to kid Tokyo Revengers if you've seen how swole a side character is and Baki imagine the main character, Any Tokyo Revenger would be killed by a Side Character In Baki. But that's just my preference.
This show really is black air force energy😭

My only regret in life is not having a mob fight .... 😥
