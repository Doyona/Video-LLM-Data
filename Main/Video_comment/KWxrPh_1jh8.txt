Big show rumble return maybe i
I miss Big Show 😢
You can see the moment where Big Show decided he would leave for AEW.
They kinda the same height And 0:05
I luv this Randy😂❤❤
Big show in Randy Orton face-to-face in 2012 2021 when they have the rivalries
RKO Boom💥
Orton: Is it working?  (What Show should’ve said) : I don’t know. But ask your momma tomorrow morning after I’m done with her tonight.
3504
This orton is the closest to the 09 menace
Said lemme sit down so I can quit and not get fired
I always loved randy Ortan 😂😂
Orton retired him live on Raw at that moment.
It is bad that wwe demoted bigshow before his retirement. How cruel. 😢 I lose the respect to randy
“Is it working?” 😂
I want Big Show to Return to WWE and as a Full Time In Ring Competitior   Win the World Heavyweight Championship   Win the WWE Championship   Intercontinental Championship    United States Championship
Hi         My         Name          is         Jordan                 Hillery
First big bro then RK-Bro WTH is goin on here? Lol
Randy orton was about to chokeslam the big show
When the Legend Killer returns, this heel run will feed generations. Cody better be very careful.
Didnt big show quit because of this?
Randy Orton awesome great good going great
Hi       My        Name       is       Jordan       Hillery
2024 randy is scheduled for another title run
Is it working?😂😂 randy is a legend dude
F you only for this wwe now he’s gone
Jesus Christ how tall is Randy!?
They could've been The Bro Show
why's he choking him then big show laughs it off and sits down
If it was Stone Cold: 🖕🦵🤛
3 years later
“Is it workin?!” 😂😂😂😂
A giant laughing at a grip is the funniest thing🤣
Randy Orton ❤️
Randy is the next stone cold Steve
Show didn't deserve this for everything he did for WWE.
The fact that he said all this to big show and also mark henry and now he's in this situation himself is crazy. But Orton not being able to compete is way more upsetting
Big shows sense of humour is the reason why I like the big show.
This was so weird lol and I read it pissed Big Show off.
Hey that is Slo Mo in Wrestling Revolution!
This was top tier Vintage Randy Orton.
in reality, Big Show is a damn nice guy. His heart is as big as his size, maybe even more.
That's the legend killer we miss for long years now can't wait to see Randy again in future
This is when big show left after this
Roles reversed it should’ve been BIG SHOW chocking randy orton 😂🤦‍♂️🤣
I can't lie you can see how mad He got when randy got him by the throat he didn't like that.
Orton is tall
Big show trying not to laugh when randy choked him lmao
Big Show doesn’t look much taller than Randy.
An went right to aew 😮ahhhhh
Big show was supposed to get beat up in this segment but he refused
The Big Show is a Legend
orton is indeed the legend killer
It's the moment that made big show downgrade to aew
Big Show was right to leave after this.. it was total character assassination. Putting guys over in the ring is one thing. Yeah the Big Show said Randy wasn't in his head, that contradicts itself though.. he just let Randy put his hands on him and his character isn't supposed to do something about it? He was right, it made his character look weak.
1:08 I'm surprised nobody has Memed Big Show's face 😂
Bigshow is legend
Show here is 6 10 max.
This segment is what made Big Show(Paul Wight) jump to AEW.
It's Me and Aadil ❤️❤️
Surprised Randy didn't break his wrist grabbing Big Show like that I like the way show no sold it and laughed at it.
The next thing, he gets injured himself to not to be seen anywhere till now.
This is the segment that caused big show to leave wwe
Big show what up cool
I wish wwe had a legends night every year
Big show🔥🔥🔥🤯🔥🔥💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Cory Meadows
👍😎🤝🙂👊🏿
Hope you guys have fun doing this gladiator challenges in the water add on land
I hope you do a challenge WWE superstars fort boyard
The segment that made big show leave wwe
Big Show: 1:12  Spongebob Narrator: A few months later...
The guy legit took offense to this segment and left for aew
That’s cool💪🏽❤️👍
تمثيل😂😂😂😂
This segment mad Big Show quit
Show is most DEFINITELY a legend. Wrestling isnt the same without him. And shame on I vince for under using show and making him the chump more often than not. If this was real fighting then show would have been a 20yr champ
His laughing was him literally being pissed with his bookings from the WWE
I hope you bus is ok🥰🥰🚌🚌
This segment made Big Show join AEW
Rko
Wao
This is the segment that allegedly offended Big Show and made him leave for AEW. That hand around the neck is disrespectful for somebody of Show's stature and years to the company.
Disqusting. Thats how you treat a legend?? This is why the wwe is a failure and a fraud.
0:41 feels so real
In reality, Paul Wight was genuinely upset with this segment, he left the company after.
Kudos to big show for resisting Orton's temptation I can relate to that
AEW!
Social distance
In reality, Big Show was really Offended by this segment tho. He felt this segment went overboard when Randy puts his hand and tries to strangle Big Show.  You can see Big Show's facial reaction, he was laughing it off and keeping his cool.   This was one of the reasons why Big Show left the WWE. quite sad if you think abt it now.
He signed with AEW after this. The fact he left due to getting offended by this segment 😆
Rk bro 😂
thanks, wrestlelamia
And so Big show quits. Thanks for making me look stupid.
Don't understand what Big Show was unhappy about. Made him look smart for once. Whatever though. No one will remember it in the end except that Randy got over.
So this is the segment that caused the Big Show to quit and join AEW? 🤔
👈AEW
So this is the segment that made Big show sign with AEW eh
I reckon big show would make a terrific King-Pin in the new spiderman movies
Jim Cornette brought me here
"Big Show" Paul Wight's WWE swan song.
wtf they did show dirty man. and not to mention he shrunk so much he use to be a monter
Randy: "Why don't you go to AEW, you won't have to shack my hand ever again"
Two legendary superstars in one video
Big show on Aew now.
"Your carrier is over thanks to me"                   ~Randy Orton
1:15
wacht jour mouth tho big show
I can tell Big show was laughing at Orton
I thought  big show was going to use  his knock out blow to randy orton
БигШоуИРэндиОртон
Big Show shrunk like crazy
Nice. Great how wwe treats the guys who built this brand.
It was just a few months later when Big Show became All Elite, signing with AEW. 😱😑😩😩😞😤
Randy Orton Is (one of) the best performers in the ring and has the best microphone skills. He's so talented verbally and physically.
And this is Why Big Show went to AEW 😂😂😂
The wwf is imploding
Big show looks very uncomfortable doing this segment
This aged well
RANDY WAS RIGHT  WHEN RANDY SHOW UP AEW  !!
Is it working??😂😂 LOL BTW this is the same thing, every man asks to a woman😅😂
This didn’t really help Orton.  It humiliated Big Show.  It made WWE look petty and disrespectful.  Great job guys!
Wowww WWE went out of their way to emasculate Show   He even laughs when he has to pretend like he’s scared and is being forced to sit back down
1.big shows hands/fists are huge,2.why is randy orton not much shorter than big show,even though there's supposed to be a 7 inch difference,big show was legitimately listed at 7'1 325 when he was a sophomore on the high school basketball team,did he lose so many inches from taking bumps like hogan?
does anybody from here see the big show show on netflix
Big Show should've stayed
I remember Randy Orton confronts big show part 2 in raw in 2021.
2021 Jan may 2010 2012 2008 2007 2006 2006 2007
I was wishing the big show would do a  ko punch to randy
Matt Riddle : Don’t leave  AEW: PAUL WIGHT IS ALL ELITE
Anyone else think that big show looks a little bit small?? Only looks about 4 inch bigger than orton
Here bro 🔥🔥🔥
RANDY ORTON THE BIG SHOW TRIPLE H JOHN CENA I MISS THIS WWE
so big show didn’t actually sing his first theme?
i miss the 2012 big show...
0:19 Big Show's fist is double the size of Matt's LOL
Big Show Big Heart.
The current stars don't got the voice and attitude like the veterans do
Who is here after big show mentioned this segment as reason for leaving
This is what made big show leave wwe
So this is the segment the Big Show was the reason he left for AEW right?
Who's Here after "Big Show" Paul Wight debut in All Elite Wrestling TNT??
Ya Orton is a bum
I see why Big Show left.😢
Damn big show's a mountain of a man!
T7UR7RR87RR6R6R6RR6R6R6R6R6R6RR6R6T6R6R6R6R6R6R7RR7R7R7R7R7R7R7RRR7RTRR7R7R6R6R6R7R7RR7R6RRRRRR6R6R7R7R7R7RR7R7RFR6R6R6R6R6R6R6R6RT6R7R7R7RT7T6T6F6F6F6R7F6RT7T6
Big show left WWE because he’s scared of Randy Orton
Soon randy's career will be over.
Love how this segment made him go to aew
Who's Randy Orton talking with? Invisible Man? 😯
RIP BIG SHOW 1999-2021
I don't see how Big Show felt embarrassed. Another program could've been made out of this or something.
I guess this was the moment wear big show forget it
Wooow big show really just let randy put his hands on him like that
Mark henry and big show vs Sheumus and randy orton
This is the exact reason why he left
At this moment with Matt Riddle Big Show realized AEW was his calling lol
How disrespectful to a legend like the Big Show. You can see why he's gone to AEW!
Sad how Vince never surprises me how low he'll go to disrespect his talent just for more viewers😔
I feel like randy Orton felt bad for doing this show and do this to the big show I hope randy goes to AEW some day
And at that moment WWE and the writers knew they f&%ked up
Paul Wight said " No Randy, I'll be on MY way"
Big show went from the nut house too the big house aew
Big Show is in AEW unfortunately
No more BS
1:03 Doen't matter i'm leaving..
Who Is Here After Big Show Announced He Was All In With AEW
Riddle: 'Don't Leave'  AEW: WEEEEEEELL!
No more bs
No more BS
His unhappy
How tall is randy orton?
Just watched aew . just wondered who big show brought with him
Poor Matt will never get to finish that convo now.
Paul Wight Is All Elite
That's why he left why Stephanie McMahon made this kind of story line lol
Was this Show's final WWE appearance?
Riddle said "don't leave". Little did he know until he left for aew one month later.
Paul Wight is All Elite
And this was the exact moment and reason why the Big show decided to leave WWE for aew
He said don't leave and he did 😭😭😭
Paul Wright is aew
Looks like Big Show took a detour on the road to Wrestlemania. Took the next exit to AEW ville.
humm! I never liked Orton,just like I didn t think anything of his dad,they got their position due to politicking,not bc they were talented. Piper was talented so he brought along Orton Sr.  HHH,Flair are talented so they brought along Bautista and groomed Orton Jr,he would not have made it on his own.
I mean randy also went at every other legend like that too soo.. mark henry is next on the all elite train lol
02/14/99 - 01/04/2021. 22 years and this is his last stop in the WWE.
Who’s here after the Big Show signed with AEW?
1:45 "Alright, that's it. I'm done. I've had it. I'm sick and tired of this BS."
Who's here after the aew signing and connecting this vid.
I think the big show didnt like to be part of this segment... honestly how can a 7ft giant like to be bullied by a much smaller superstar?+
Has bigshow shrunk.randy orton is almost his height
Liking all the comments about him leaving
We better watch this video and All of his one last time before WWE takes all of big shows videos down😂
Big Show is NOT 7 feet. 😄 Not even close. Maybe 6'10.
Was this his last apperance/segment in wwe
What's The Big Bro doing in the Dynamite Zone?!
Wow man I gotta give it to WWE they really know how to ya know show respect for their "Legends". Like they don't make them look like weak individuals at all. They don't punish them for saying how WWE can make improvements or anything 🤣.
Big show is a working hard
Big show was well on his way out of the WWE, that's right Show do your thing in secret minding your business.
Bye Show Big Show 😒 wwe is losing
Looks like this was shows last appearance. Current WWE wrestlers deserve better
Who is here after Big show revealed he was unhappy with this segment
Who would of ever thought that on that day in January that the next month in February that Big Show would sign with AEW
Damn Randy made Matt Hardy switch over to AEW and now the Big Show.
ah thats why he left....
This scared Big Show so much he defected to AEW. :)
Aew Big Show
Randy orton is the reason why big show left wwe
Damn and all it took was this for big show to go to AEW
WOW!!!! PAUL WRIGHT IS NOW IN AEW
I think we'll see BIGSHOW at AEW.
Who’s here after big show signed for aew?
This was the reason Big Show left WWE. He didn’t feel valuable to the company. His gonna be way better in AEW, WWE just gave another huge advantage to AEW. As a result, I’m now more eager to watch both companies now.
Never thought this segment is one of the main reason why Big Show left...
The straw that broke the camel's back.
so this is why Paul left the chat
THEY SHOULD OF VALUED BIG SHOW MORE LIKE IF U AGREE
Whos here after paul wight became all elite baby woooooo
Thanks for pissing him off Randy. No he's on AEW.
And now "Big Show" is All Elite
I'm here to see what Randy said to Big show that he left WWE after it
Randy Orton rules
So this is why Big Show signed with AWE huh
Big Show Paul Wight is AEW!!! Welcome to the ELITE program!
big show se encogio?
Here after big show announcing he’s jumped ship to aew
It worked Randy, it worked. Maybe did a little too much. Outdid.
here before wwe disables comments on this video
And now Big Show is in AEW
Looks like Orton finished him for real
You disrespect the Big Show like that, treat a giant like a victim, no wonder he's gone to AEW
You can clearly see big show upset and as emotional as he is at the end you could tell he wanted to shed a few tears like you gonna do me dirty like this and hogan's last wwe match was against Orton big show last wwe match was against Orton
Is this a reason Y Show went to AEW reported by Wrestlemaina
One of the possible  reasons of big show departure from WWE
This Will make now Big show is AEW.
In case you didnt know this was the reason why big show is joining aew
This segment makes more sense now , Big shows contract was up at this point, indirect message from Vince
This is why he's getting paid and the RESPECT HE DESERVES. THANK YOU AEW FOR SIGNING THE GIANT PAUL WHITE!!!!
That my friends The Big Show's last WWE appearance.
So, big show left...
And now good luck in aew big show
This is big show's final appearance in wwe before he moves to AEW months later.
back here after aew signed him up
The segmant that made Big Show leaving WWE.
If u didnt do this he might not have went to AEW 🤷🏿‍♂️
Goodbye Big Show 😧😨
goes to aew without playing with himself.... i think that is spit in the face to randy orton n team
Well... he did something about it.
The final straw. It was the hand on the neck, wasn't it?
last.
randy orton did the same thing to mark henry!!
I can believe that this was the last straw for the Big Show. Curious about his role in AEW.
This is the reason big show left
AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW
Good Job Vince. You hold back the Big Show and then do a segment that he is scared to step back in the ring and have him back down like a coward. But in reality ... you don't want him back in the ring.  Nice job embarrassing your talent to the point they sign with the competition. Look at it this way. The WWE embarrasses all of the legends. They are bad assed all their career. But when they retire. They are cowards who get bullied and do nothing. Big show, Mark Henry and Ric Flair with his constant crying. WWE is terrible the way they use legends.  And then don't get me started on the women. When a Woman wins the title ... she sits in the ring and cries. When she loses the title. She sits in the ring and cries. Like an entitled sore loser. When her partner turns on her ... she sits in the middle of the ring and cries.  Nice way to treat the women like a stereotype and the legends like a bunch of cowards. Its a surprise anybody signs with the WWE at this point. WWE wouldn't be the WWE if they didn't have a show where a female wrestler and/or Ric Flair are not crying at some point.
He in AEW now
Who came here after Big show join AEW ?
Big Show went to AEW partly because of this segment apparently.

Whose here are Big Show signed with AEW
Paul Wight is ALL ELITE!
Big Show/Paul Wight last WWE Night since 1999.
Can't see Big Show being "upset" about a segment like this. He's a pro. Glad he is getting the money he deserves and he'll get to put over new stars in a new company. Exciting stuff.
Goodbye Big Show, thanks for the great memories and making my childhood awesome.   1999-2021
The Big Show was mad about this? Come on man. This is the standard "putting someone over" that he's done his whole life. So he's mad about this but he's not mad about getting knocked out by a 5 foot nothing, 100 and nothing Floyd Mayweather? In real life, Big Show woulda laughed off that punch and tossed Money Mayweather aside like a child.
Who is here after the breaking news of Big Show being AEW confirmed?
*Big Show is in AEW now!!*
Who’s here’s after the  Big Show signs with Aew

Big Show is on AEW 😌
Who's here after Big Show news heading to AEW?

And a month later he is a AEW guy.
Paul Wight is all elite
whos here after big show went to aew
Big Show is now all elite!!!
The Big Show has transformed into taller, bald version of Ric Flair.
Randy Orton is on another level 😎😎 , untouchable 😎😎🔥🔥
the old big show would destroy Randy
The Big Bro xD
HAPPY 49TH BIRTHDAY BIG SHOW !!!
I love the legend killer mode
I love how these storylines are going back to the wwe
Why dose Randy sort of sound like thanos
oldschool
Man the big show he was more heel than face remember when he chokeslam kurt angle off a balcony
Big bro cringe
See you in 8 months Big Show 😉
RKO!!
Matt is everything I love about wrestlers like him he’s hilarious and can put on a show
Seriously that day Randy Orton was being Bully Orton😂😂😂
I would have liked to have seen. The big show and Samoa Joe in a mach
Big show is the real legend he has been in the wwe since 1999 to 2021 2 decades and 2 years in the wwe and he is a classic
The Big Brow!!!
Randy's at his best when he's being himself... a jerk haha but all love to the viper bruh one of my heroes growing up.
legend orton best heel ever
This is the first wwe video I v seen since March 2020
Randy his really stupid and sick he need help  👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Randy ia 6.6 and show is 7 why are they're so close or is wwe heights fake
Idk why i want this, but I'd love to see Orton team up with another legend, like Big Show, just to take over the tag team division, for no other reason than Orton felt like it
How tall is Randy now 😳
Big show looks like he’s 6’8 max.... RIP 7footer :(
What is it with this guy.. leave big show alone
Randy really don't want non facts.
Randy gently tickled Big Show’s neck
Randy  Orton is  a fool
Orton still dull as ever.
Now we need stone cold back
Yes big show is back yay
Randy is the best in WWE. Everyone throwing shade on him saying he isn't a legend and all that, he's gonna be a bigger legend than all of them when he's done.
Randy orton reminds me of my friend who goes to everybody and annoys them for absolutely no reason... The Legend Pisser
Big shows a stallion
Top star in wwe right NOW....RANDY ORTON!
Randy is the most consistent wrestler in WWE...period
“ThE bIg BrOOooO”
Big shows face has not aged since he was in wcw
Randy was like a kid in a candy shop on legends night 😆
Randy is back with beard after 2014
Randy Orton . the best Antagonist in wwe .
Randy Orton is the LeBron James of wwe
Savage
So when Randy Orton is in the hall of fame and a legend. Does he give himself an RKO?
Ok. I hate Orton
big show should have said to the three deadliest letters, "619?? that's rey".
randy hasn't done anything different since 2008.
Ain't randy is legend too ?
Seems like Big Show is not Real 7'0 Footer. Randy Orton is around 6'4 and is not a lot of different in Height. Probably Big Show is around 6'7 now.
Nokalpont do big show
Big show is nothing now days should change his name to slim show he  hasn’t been any good since since the sumo and maywether times Braun is bigger  and Braun looks small to some other guys new to the business
wwe - literally makes 3 videos of 2 minutes “Randy Orton taunts” “Randy Orton threatens” Randy Orton confronts”.      Should’ve simply made a video titled Randy Orton disrespects legends......🤦🏻‍♂️
Randy is a Legend himself now
Could of sworn Randy Orton laid the smackdown on TBS and Flair like 2 months ago.
Good to see Big Show with a clean trimmed beard.
Randy doesn't need any title. Actually he is title😂
Bruh, how many legends will Randy take on man. Is he not scared of fiend
Mo' like DA BIG JOKE
Did big show get shorter
This happens ALL NIGHT, & Goldberg is no where to be found....Yet Drew gives the legends a front row seat for his match, and THAT upsets SENILE GOLDBERG???   Seriously, WHO THE HELL WROTE THIS GARBAGE SORRY ESCUSE  FOR WRESTLING SHOW???  🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Jason Mewes is a WWE superstar now?
He's the legend killer but the biggest legend of all right now
Randy Orton is the greatest wwe super star.. He is about to have most pay per views matches
If anyone needs an RKO and a punt to the head, it's riddle.
ohhhh mannnn randy is the man.
Mathematically big show would snap randy orton if he tried that grab in real life
0:08 I've low key always wanted to see big show sing the first part of his theme song my whole life  I wasnt disappointed
I hope gold berg faces Randy some time
I can’t take randy serious chocking the big show maybe if it someone like dominik 😂
I can’t tell you why, but Randy Orton is like a manly man version of Barney Stinson
BAKHO IOMAKID
Does Show still have abs?
Dare to randy
Should have gave him a big fat ko punch
Randy's like that relative you have to invite for Christmas even tho he gets pissed off his arse and starts fights with the family all night
Big Show aint no 7ft..more like 6'9 or 6'8..bkuz randy bout 6'5
19 years of Randy Orton
Gold berg challenge actually Randy Orton   because He disrespect  legends
“Is it working?” “No it’s not working!” 😂😂😂
No social distance btw Bigshow & Randyrotten
No social distance btw Bigshow & Randyrotten
Randy oru legendkiller but immature person behave
Then goldberg promo was botched
Legends exist  Randy orton: so i see you chose death 🐍
Great
These two still got better promo than entire wwe show
Is it working 🤣
Orton vs show at wrestlemania is confirmed
Can somebody for the love of God tell me why goldberd did not go after randy orton
I hate RANDY ORTON
randy has some hilariously serious past
I think Orton is arguably one of the greatest of all time. It looks like he already is today, now imagine in 10 years from now.
Just a thought wouldnt it be cool to see randy strike on his dad cowboy bob😈😈😈
Is it working
randy and roman should join Aew...
“Is it working?” 😂🤣😂🤣 I’m finished.
Kids: John Cena Men: Edge Legends: *RKO*
Just as expected from Randy. He never let forget any of the legends present there that he is the legend killer.
Randy seeing a bunch of legends in the arena is like me walking into toys r us when I was a kid
Please let the legend killer come back in 2021
Randy has been in this business since 2002. Randy has definitely hit 🐐
Rande you the legend 😍
Riddle should have an Idea about making RKBRO...
Ya absolutely. just like Randy and Mustafa Ali said .   I was also thinking that legends would compete in ring at legends night. but they dint 😶
Imagine he tried pulling this on Stone Cold.....RKO meet the 3:16
Is it scripted
These guys are legit friends lol they were dining together at a Denny’s when they were in the town I live in when Raw was in town lol
Randy Orton is GOAT 🔥🔥🔥🔥
“It’s The Big Show” 🔥🤟💯
This show could have been so much better.. Goldberg doing a promo that literally made no sense against Drew for disrespecting the legends.. when he didnt. It was Randy..  Also.. you have a Legends night and have a Legend Killer on the same show but all he did was 'talk'to them?. Raw used to be my favourite show.. now i dont even get excited to see it.
Randy hitting left to right best villain haha 😒🤣🤣
Randy is himself a legend
It’s sooo good to see the big show
Great
Randy orton has one of the most natural characters ever.
Randy still running wwe since 2002
And the best and the best
Randy is the best
Randy Orton is still a viper in 2021 🔥🔥
Randy stop being a pig for once
I'm seeing Orton thumbnails left and right from the same night? WTF is going on lmao. It's why hes a legend though
Look at the confidence that's why I like Orton
They are talking without mask
I was expecting WMD Outta nowhere
You know you're a real G if you threaten a Giant
All these verbal tirades by Randy are just leading to each of these legends he confronted returning at the Royal Rumble.
Randy is corny
Randy a true motivational speaker for big show 😂😂
Who dislike wee videos
If Randy Orton retires WWE bout to ran out of business 🤣
،😲😲😲😲💀
Why is randy Orton bullying all these legends
Randy: Being a legend killer on Raw isn't easy, that's why I do it, it comes naturally to me ,and puts a smile on my face. Legends night is my night.
now kiss
Big show gonna turn heel tomorrow watch
The BIG SHOW is the always THE BEST.
Big show looks really good and healthy
Why you saying that randy maybe big show should ruined your career in thee,, wwe with just a punch to the skull
That's not big show ... It's the big bro
"The three deadliest words in sports entertainment!" That's when he shoulda hit him with the WMD!
How tall is Randy?
Who the hell is the Hippie MVP?
Wonder if Randy Orton will get a chance to wrestle with Japanese wrestlers like Tetsuya Naito, Kota Ibushi or etc.
Big Broooooooooooooooo
Randy Orton is so overrated and boring
Randy facing the legend big show
Is it working? 😂
0:19 [first name redacted] Riddle is not a small man, but Paul's fist is literally double the size of his.
2021 will be a legendary year for randy orton
Big show WMD punch is the super dragon fist!
jesus randy must be freaking tall to almost be the same height as show
Big show remember the chair shot in the dark
Ever since 2004, Randy Orton has been one of WWE's biggest stars/main eventers and still is to this day. He just keep getting better and better. His mic skills has been perfection and still got this crazy heel heat from 2020. Orton is still Raw's biggest heel
WWE universe I like WWE so bad
L😂L SAVE ORTON
Also everyone randy orton has beaten goldberg in a 4 on 1 handi cap to
Man, I love the big show so much
Is it me Or Is randy Orton making every legend  fell like Not coming to raw 😥😌
Orton turned into the Rock for about 5 seconds @0:35
So this Raw Legends Night was all about the old legends of WWE hanging out backstage until the end of the show
Big bro haha
Kick his butt Big Show!!!!
Randy Orton is heel again 😂
1:15 both of them are smiling 😜🤣
Randy threatening the BIG GUY 😂
Randy Orton is at the top now ,he is just untouchable ,he is just outstanding ,Cena can't reach here as Randy has taken his ground 🔥🔥😎😎 what a legend ,just waiting for his 16th reign
Is it working ?? Ajajajaa
randy is the *OG*
Randy was like..wow legends everywhere ..it's gonna be good...lts taunt everybody🤣
Yeah cause that is what we all want to watch Orton just cutting people down. Yeah sorry we don't have anything for you we would rather have Orton just making fun of people in the most boring way ever. I like Orton but how do you expect the future to thrive when you constantly constantly constantly constantly shove the same people down or Our throats.
Loki and the
When she says is it working hell no it's not 😆😆😆
Where has Edge gone?
Today's " wrestling " still pretty pathetic.
Someone should really teach Randy a good hard lesson about respecting WWE legends
C'mon give us a second season of the big show show .
Randy doesnt know whom to pick so many options XD
1:50 title of this song ?
did he just call him matt ohhhhhh hes gunna be in trouble
Vhjfhbxj có cần gì thì cứ nói là con trai mà con có đi làm rồi cô yẻueutywryeewe
Big Show!!
Orton is carrying RAW. If he were on SD, RAW would be near 1 Mil.
Big show is 6'10 and randy is 6'4 but here big show looks like 6'6🤔
I liked how Show laughs when Randy grabbed him😂
i was like WTH randy's gonna chokeslam bigshow😂😂😂 i was absolutely shocked seeing randy chok on bigshow heels supposed to be afraid but not randy
Big Show: You're trying to get me to do something foolish aren't ya?  Randy: Is it working?  Big Show: No  🤣
Next Heel or face turn and his netflix series
Wow. Orton cranking it up to an 11.
Legends: *exist* Orton: And I took that personally
Shows how far WWE has fallen when a bland Randy Orton promo is a highlight of the show.
Randy orton never cease to amaze almost eventually
Who else thought he was gonna turn after the fist bump
Hi
Ortons mic skills sure have fallen off compared to before, but then WWE has fallen off
WELLLLLL WELLL ITS THE BIG SHOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!
I’m really great when Big Show’s returning, it has continues.
Stupid
I already know what’s gonna happen. The legends are gonna come together and jump Orton, maybe even at the RR
Did big show shave his eyebrows of something?
Randy Orton legend killed next camp  Future John cena vs rko 16 time camp big match wait
I don’t understand this height difference at all...Big show is 7ft and Randy Orton is 6ft 5. But they are almost the same height looking at this video.
Damn.. randy got tall- . . . . . . . -er ☠️
So... Randy's new thing as about provoking people?  Cuz he feels he cant hit them first?
Hi this is wwe superstar John Cena
WWE may have uploaded ten videos later night of which nine belongs to Orton's
Is it working???? Savage 😹😹😹😹
Big shows pipe game strong
Action
Legends exist randy Orton time to die

Big show should give ko punch👊 to randy
Is it working?🤣🤣🤣🤣
I miss and LOVE big show. One of the greatest giants of all time. And I think at a lot of times was very very under used at wwe
Ironically Big Show is better liked in retirement than he was when wrestling
Randy Orton DISRESPECTFUL to all the Legends  Goldberg: Drew mcintyre the one thing you don't have is respect Drew mcintyre: WWE universe: !!
Orton: “Is it working 😏?”  Me: 🤣🤣🤣😂😂
I really wanted to see Orton try to punt kick Hogan and then lights go out just to come back on with The Fiend attacking Hogan.
What happen with carlito ??
Note to wwe if ur going to have a legends event u probably want to make sure the legend killer is not part of the show just saying lol
👹😡😡👹😡😡👹😠
Cool🔥😎
Rko
Yo big show looks good
Randy was the best in the business for the last 10 years
Top 5 Stone cold  Kurt angle Ultimate warrior Kevin nash Randy orton
Randy Orton is boring bro doing the same stuff every time.....
What’s wrong with Big Show? I’m a little older than him and I don’t have those bags under my eyes.   I hope you’re good.
Randy at it again picking on the senior citizens lol. I smell Big Show and Mark Henry suprise Royal Rumble entries, attempt eliminations on Randy and then-- "you think you know me..."
WEEEEELLLLLLLLLLLLLL
😂😂😂El mejor
Is it working 😂😂
It's Legend Night Randy Orton:Hold my beer 🍻 😂😂🤣🤣
Why did he try choking the Big Show tho😂
Who cares? Go watch Ali on Raw Talk instead.
Matty riddle is amazing
Big Show got some pipes....that was pretty impressive   Loving this side of Randy btw
This was Randy’s day off pretty much 🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️
Man their chemistry is awesome
The Big Show The Legend
But hey, drew was disrespectful at the legends
I think wwe could use the big shows tune.  "THE BORRNING SHOW"
If have big show vs randy orton at royal rumble i expect big show wins
Saw this episode last night on Raw. Were Randy met up with Big Show. He says that he's going to talk to some Legends. Talking no. Punting however yes.
Randy sucks
The legends are all going to enter the Royal Rumble and gang up on Randy.
Randy is a great wrestler much respect to him but one of these days big show is going to get so mad he’s going to mess Randy up Randy thinks he can keep tempting and pushing show but watch when big show releases the giant in him he will hurt Randy big show isn’t scared of no one never has never will be but big show knew that Randy wanted show to do something but show does things when he wants to and by the looks of it he’s ready to bring some pain to Randy I can’t wait to see it
Best Superstar on Roster, Randy Orton is the only star that can do it all!
Quit picking on big shows orton leave him alone you bully
The Big BROOOOO? YEAH NOOOO
Mehn, Randy Orton go out there making life miserable for people. I love it 😂😂😂😂 it's RKO society
randy is the greatest  HEEL OF ALL TIME 🙏👍
Tandy owned Legend Raw he just too good
Randy ortan savage asf !!
Definitely top 5 heels of all time. Every year Randy just keeps getting better and better. But 1 day Randy too will gets this treatment on his legends night.
Big Show should of made Orton flinch😊
Would have been nice if Big show just grabbed Randy from behind as he was walking away and threw him into something 🙂 he's a legend what are they going to do LOL

Random Old man : Randy Orton: Hi
Big show vs Randy Orten where a good match
Fun fact big show vs drew was the main event of wrestlemania in 2020
The fiend is in Randy's head. That's 🔥🔥🔥
Is it working😂😂😂😂😂 i'm dead
one day Randy will also get old and couldn't fight. so what's the point in telling elder ones that you're done with wrestling. it's no brainer. It's not even mean. it's rather cheap. Randy Orton is a cheapster.
Wait a minute hold the phone-Big Show may be fighting for the legends now but at a moment's notice he'll KO Punch them and McIntyre and hey presto he turns heel for the bajillionth time.
You can tell Show wanted to bust out laughing so hard 😂 caught him off guard
It's not Legend Raw night it's Randy Orton "The Legend Killer" Raw night
Big show is shrinking rapidly, barely looks over 6'9 here now.
It’s gonna be awkward when randy is an old man himself getting taunted by a young buck 😂
Did big show get shorter or is randy on tippy toes?
Big show welcome home
Randy is the one legend in this night who was in the ring full time from nearly 2 decades and still competing full time , defenetly deserves huge respect. No disrespect intended to the other legends though , they all are still equally good
How tall is the big show now I used to think he was 7”0 tall now he looks 6”9
This video went from one mode to the other. SPEAK.
0:24 Big Show sneak diss Riddle keep thinkn
0:24 Big Show sneak diss Riddle keep thinkn

Randy Orton is Arthur Morgan walking around Valentine, antagonizing the locals twice, but never a 3rd time, because that’s when they fight back.
0:04 The Big Brooo 😂

Pig Show and Randy Orto
0:08

The Big broooo
Legends night? Or Legend serial killer night? who willing to take the light 🔥 to them, I mean fight, willing to take the fight to them.

Big Show: You’re trying to get me to do something foolish. Is that what you want? Randy: Is it working? *smiles* Me: This is funny and intense

Big Show turned heel twice while he was sitting in that chair

Only a matter if time until Big Show turns heel again.
Tom and Jerry😂😂
Lmao old school randy is the best randy
Legends: H--  Randy Orton: Peace was never an option
If this was real, Big Show would destroy Randy Boredom.
Riddle is best friends with all the giants lol
Why all vids 2 mins
Why did orton try to chokeslam big show LMAOOO
Riddle is hilarious lol & randy never disappoints in a promo
Big show would have been an incredible kingpin in spiderman
Randy Orton is never a disappointment🐍, one of the reasons I like him❤🔐
Bro years from now, Randy Orton is gonna be in the place of the legends, that’s crazy
Big show and randy orton smackdown vs raw 2010😅

legends night would probably be the night that randy orton most looking forward to
I want a 3hour Randy Orton show.
2011/2012 Big show would have knocked him out ten times by now.
Brock should return and beat randy ortan
ايش مهله راندي
I'm getting 2014-2015 vibes here
Wow randy so tall 😂
Secretly this is all build up to another edge return
Randy Orton disrespects all the legends: Nothing.  Drew McIntyre breaths, Goldberg: !DISRESPECT!!"
Big show is the man i would love him in a match with randy
Big Show looks ill
It's the "is it working" for me lmao
Should be orton vs goldberg
48 vs 40 weird😲

Randy: I really want to Chokeslam you 😡  Big Show: Bruh, you think 😒
IS ORTON A FACE I AM SO CONFUSED WITH HIS STORYLINE
If i were the big show ....one knock out punch
Who the hell are the stars now in WWE? last time I watched was when becky lynch retired.
Re-sign Big Show for 2 years.  Send him back into the fray.
Well it’s the big broooooooo
did Show confront Orton a year ago too?
Big show could've been such a huge star if he didn't job out to every guy in the business.
Thank u RKo u r from wwf until wwe only the last man standing god damnit
Man they better let mark comeback and punch the hell out of randy when his leg heals
There were a few things i was hoping for from this segment 1. When orton grabbed big show i was hoping he would do the same thing then let there be a brawl between them 2. I was hoping there be a match between them or him come out and attack orton during his match
Big show fight randy again
Big show make a can back in the royal Rumble 2021
Big show startin to look old
Randy Orton carrying this show just like Roman Reigns is carrying smackdown.
Riddle and goldberg Met backstage for sure
Weeeelllllllll
I hope this ended with all of the disrespected legends teaming up on Orton and beating him up
It’s true
Yass
riddle sucks
Okay now Big Show is a face or a heel?
The big brooooo 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love that Randy genuinely asked if it was working
Tune in next week folks for more “What’s happening in the real world”.
Big ups to Orton for still being a Full timer.
This reminds me 2008 - 2009 Orton mainly 2009 heel orton and legend killer gimmick mixed
look how huge big show hand
The Big “Bro” 🤣 Riddle’s ability to turn everything into his Bro catch phrase never ceases to amaze me
Loved the video
I think the legends will attack orton in the royal rumble
He’s Scared of Him
Randy needs to enter the arena with Burn in my Light
Randy is still the ruthless more than ever
I love Undertaker
Kazaxstan
Is this just Randy Orton bullies people night?
I hope Big Show gets a final match
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeereeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeell it's the Big Show

Big show got 3 dangerous letters aswell..WMD
Well technically big shows last match was with drew and not with randy orton nice try hahaha
Back with his 2015 beard big show looks great
when orton is done its gonna be sad wont even pay attention anymore
Matt Riddles brain: "bRo"
Show is such a chill dude. He comes off as a much more natural "bro" than Riddle here.

Randy Orton the b****

Ютуб скорее бы тебя закрыли.

If Big Show is 7 foot, Randy must be 6ft 9 or something lol
Randy Orton woke up and chose violence 😂😂
Either show got shorter or randy wearing high heels 😂
Big show: You’re trying to get me to do something foolish. Orton: is it working Big show: no it’s not working, you’re not in my head
Randy seeing any legend : I'm gonna end this man whole career
Big Show looking pretty smaller than usual
I just stopped in to see what Matt was Going to say 🤓
Riddle and Big Show form team Bro Show
So like.... who else wants big show to make an album doing some kinda country or some kinda singing album

randy shoulders gotta hurt from carrying this entire show every week
yo when randy grabbed show's neck, i said, welp hes done. not what i expected.

The big show isn't actually quite big anymore
Orton vs big show wm 37

Randy mocks those legends because he think he is legend killer? He become nothing when face brock & roman
Theres going to be an end game for Randy, A legend is gonna come back who will come out of retirement. Just trying to think who it could be.

I want to see big show fight again just for a little while
Randy is such a nutty character.
Big Show should’ve knocked him out
Big show looks like he shrunk a few inches.
Big show wins easy Ko punch
They really missed their opportunity to have Matt  Riddle and RVD have backstage segment.
Love Randy oton
Big Show looks like he's been out in the sun or maybe just hitting the gym hard
Orton's mic skills are excellent.
0:08 wow big show can do it
I wonder why john cena dont carry wwe like randy orton.. He just want popularity, no love for wrestling.. Haiishh.. Really mad at cena
2021 the legends have risen between randy and big show once again
He's just walking around messing with people 😂
The fiend vs big show will also be a good feud
Kill one Demon and you think own the joint, be careful RKO.
Younglings, take note on how this 2 legends do a promo and give each other a banter
Ok we need Michael Hayes to sing the big show’s theme but saying bro instead of show Do it wwe!
WMD vs RKO
*Raw Legends Night Exist*  Randy Orton: It's Free Real Estate
This character is great
"I like it Matt."  Um who's Matt, this is Riddle
The legend killing viper apex predator

Riddle makes me cringe so f f f f bad

*Cops:* What are you up to this time, pal?  *Randy:* Nothing smoky! I'm just tryna mess with the Big Show's mind.  *Cops:* Understandable. Have a great day then!
Matt Riddle outfit looks like a 1994 Orlando Magic Jersey
THE BIG BROO
Lol damn this Randy is fun. I hope he win the Rumble so he can face Drew...cause that will be a fight then.
There must be something wrong with me because I can't stop laughing at "THE BIIIIIIIG BROOOOOOO"
I so wanted The Undertaker to show up so Randy could walk himself out of the building.
What if WWE wrestler voice DC and Marvel characters
Orton is horrible. 10 years ago he would of hit a RKO and walk away  not talk a bunch and do nothing
0:18 Big Show knocks out Matt Riddle's fist😭😂
Drew took 3 Punt Kicks in one night and he still wrestle regulary, sad they had to do that to Punt Kick
Legends night and Legend killer. VERY EPIC
WWE... please never make Randy face again because he's such a perfect a-hole 😂😂this man was born to be a heel
Of every legend there, Big Show is the only one I can see having a match again.
Bruh this Orton guy.  🤣🤣
I'm still waiting for the Knockout out a nowhere
Hahaha Randy orton thrashing legend is so funny
Me when I'm losing my virginity: "is it working?"
The big bro love it 😂
THE BIG BROOOO and LITTLE VIPER randy Orton  the best of the loser
Big Show looks like a tall version of Rick Harrison
I think matt riddle segment should be added with the legend. It will be totally funny. Imagine matt riddle selling bronutt with the legend and introduce his business to legend.
Big show doesn't hear voices in his head  they don't talk to him he don't understand, don't talk to him, they don't talk to him ooohhh
Big Show is the most genuine guy there is in wwe.
If you ever feel sad remember Randy tried to shockslam the big show
he's hungry for dem legends
30:27 Anyone want to do this with me😍💋 💝💖♥️❤️
Randy was awesome in this episode
First of all big show is not even a legend that man do nothing
Your wrong Randy!!! The last time Big show was in the ring was with Drew Macintyre
Is he Face now? or a Heel?
Thank you for calling him matt
Big Bro is good, but nothing like the legendary BIG SLOW.
Superstar randy and big show
The big show he is in fighting mode everytime he hears randy orton telling him the last time he was in that wwe ring
Randy orton and big show friends
Really? Randy puts His Hands on the Big show and he's sit's Down What?
Big Show shrunk! Show's chin used to touch Randy head, now they almost looking eye to eye.
I dont care
big show still called him matt  even big show hated this shortening name bs
Dean Ambrose return video on my channel! 🔥
Bruh, Big Show is starting to show that he’s aging a bit, breaks my heart🥺💔
I couldn't stop laughing when Orton asked "Is it Working"
The big bro works
Randy should do a crossface!❗️❗️❗️
Can someone tell me what happened to Alexa
Randy Orton "The Legend Killer" in an arena full of legends. Somebody getting fired.
Remember when they were in the Authority in 2013-15. Remember when the Shield helped the Authority.
Randy Orton voice style on 0:39 like Thanos
I WWE is awesome to Watch and see
Is Big Show injured I really wanted to see him return
“Is it working”? 😂
Big Show has quiet a history with Randy  2013- Show ko’ed Randy during their rivalry with the shield 2013- Show turned face and feuded with Orton and the authority  2015- they were part of the authority  2020- Show was one of many victims during Randy’s reign of terror  2021- this confrontation
Sorta wanna seem ortan and show at mania with shows career on the line
so big show face again?
What is randy ortan disrespecting the Legend for?
Randy Orton is the Legend Killer. He's messing with everybody. Lol.
Ever since they started to make Randy psycho and ruthless once again the quality of his matches has improved and become more entertaining and even exciting... finally at par with his gimmick. You can clearly see he is motivated. RKO a true legend.
If randy and riddle teamed up, would their tag name be RKBRO?
Thought big show was 7ft and ortin 6'4.
Randy forever bro. I love how he carrying the show and still destroys people. Without him WWE feels different.
Randy not finish business with the Big Show
Big Show has some guts on Randy Orton. Take that, you slithering viper snake! 1:11.
Matt Riddle meets Big Show and gives him a nickname "Big Bro." 😁 0:01. He likes it, but he hates Randy Orton over the WWE Legends gets themselves hurt including Bray Wyatt "The Fiend." 0:24. 😡.
Everybody looken great and real good in perfect shape
1:15  Randy orton : is it working 🙃 Big Show ... No 😆

Big show 💯💯
Is it working? 🤣
Three most destructive letters WMD
Big Show isn't done with Randy Orton yet.
Big Show: Your tryna get in my head Randy: "Is it Working?" 😂
It was good seeing Big show and Riddle talk tell Randy went to talk to Big show
"I'm proud to go out there with the Legends!" "What's your thoughts on Hulk Hogan?" "....."
Did they hint that big show is returning in ring competition. For the last time like they doing with Daniel Bryan
Big Show should come out of Returns, and face Randy Orton.
And the 2 deadliest letters r KO
It's 2021 and Randy Orton is still one of the biggest stars in the wwe
A Big Show returns without face/heel turn? That’s a first
The day Randy retires will be the day I tune off this show.
Rko will never be as dangerous as prime nwo. Big facts 💯.
When Last Tine Randy Orton Fight With The Big Show.
This is great watch this.Randy shows up to talk to Big Show.👍👍
So many good matches of Big Show and Randy Orton
Hey Big Show's beard is grew a little bit now because I remember that he shaved his beard
Big show should align with Randy orton
I like how Randy is finished with the fiend and now he's looking for more trouble lol
Big show should have give orton KO punch
Big Show called Riddle, Matt👀
Without Randy Orton, WWE is completely irrelevant when it comes to this generation.
When did randy get taller I thought big show was 7 feet tall so how randy is passed big show shoulders
ok that's a big disrespect
'Most deadliest'...His grammar isn't as onpoint as the RKO, obviously.
Did Big Show just call him Matt?
Sing big show
Nothing much here just two bald men in a heated conversation
Hey it's the Big Slow!!!
Bloody Randy
The fiend is Coming randy
I forget Randy Orton is pretty tall
Man randy been wresting for wwe for 2 decades and still aint taken no breaks unless he injured
“Compete”
“Your career is over, thanks to me! How does it feel?”     The whole conversation was captivating.
Either big show shrunk or Randy got massive
God, Matt riddle sucks. Why did wwe hire this clown?
It's the Big BROOOOOO
Well it's The Big Bro
Wow, Big Show backed down from Orton. He's bigger too, and he backed down.
Randy Orton and Big Show rivalry continues
Was this another Big Show turn? I can’t keep track
Old show 😂
Bear vs snake
Laike si quieres ver al demonio
It's always gold when Randy Orton is intimidating legends it's something how a psychopathic heel work should be.
Big Show should have KO Punched Randy.

The height comparison between Big Show and Randy Orton. It's so intimidating.
Remember when randy and big show had that little fued back in 2013?
Carlito Should Be Back At Royal Rumble 2021.
Omg look how talented our Big Show is he can sing lol On top of that he is the best high flyer after my cutie Ryback  He is unstoppable he can beat any on the roster today  Ryback is a pg legend  Big show is a skinny high flyer

Big show is one of the best in ring competitors. That’s good he’s back
To be honest I thought big show was gonna knock ortons head clean off
Big Show the only Wrestler to go from Face to Heel hundreds of times in his career
