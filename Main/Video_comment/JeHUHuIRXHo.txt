That liver shot of ryan reminded me of canelo
Welp Shakur Stevenson said it was 3,000  in attendance I agree 😂😂😂😂
Why does his height change every fight?
The most powerful off body shoot
I’m from hull, this guy is now our mayor 😂
This is wat we should of seen in the rolly Romero fight n tank younger Ryan was a more hungrier Ryan more capable to .
this ryan garcia is dead
What happened to "THIS" Garcia ??? Where'd he go ? 🤔 $$$ Maybe ? Idk.
My favourite boxer is Luke Campbell he is champion and strong enough 😊
Viva México siempre potencia mundial en boxeo
Its crazy how this video has more views than more important fights in boxing lol
I bet tickets were super cheap a lot of people fumbled the bag!
Great fight
?
Keep Your Head Up Baby ..
C'Mon Baby .. Garcia ..
That's my cousin!!!
Knocked the breakfast out of his mouth with that right hand 💯
Schulist Roads
That's the Ryan I like to see again he needs to go back to Canelo team he was a beast and unstoppable kid 💯💪💪🥊🥊
Sen istersen sun
Bro lucky he didnt brake his arm
I wonder How Long RYAN been taking PEDs???
Garcia is a baaad man 💪🏽🙏🥊
Shot like Juan Manuel Marquez body blow pedden
I like this kid Garcia brings honor to boxing by boxing competitively against real boxers unlike those clowns the Paul idiot brothers Logan is on the secret Creatine and Jake is a gimmick fighter a disgrace to boxing
one think that garcia has so much attitude, he celebrates one powerful shot like winning a match 💀
Steroid boy got away with one here
American commentators are so annoying
this is Ryan's most entertaining fight to date
garcia is 5'10 on this fight?, while  in haney's fight garcia was 5'9 1/2
Faked a left hook to the head and went straight to the body
better than haney
Wasn’t complaining about the weight here 😂😂😂😂
Cleanest body shot I ever seen
7:11 beautiful.  Oh, we're doing body shots?  Here, have one back. lol
Untimely end to the fight as it was just warming up  Beautiful delivery from Garcia
Who here after he killed deven Haney
I won’t lie. After this fight and with tank, he’s been vary cautious to not get knocked down again lol
who is here after Haney fight?
Knocked that Brit out
ryan was never the same
On 10:00 a.m. at Tuesday night, he went to school then subsequently went home.   At 10:00 a.m. on January 2nd, he was questioned and subsequently arrested.   On 10:00 a.m. on January 2nd he was question and after arrested
Idk why Luke didn’t attack after the knockdown
Garcia no sabe ni caminar
2:35-2:45
If you can take garcias punches you can take wilders shots easily. Thats how hard ryan hits you can see how fast twitchy and powerful that kid is
haney will get knocked TF out
People disnt realize it at the time but thats the knockdown that changed garcia for ever ,, hea never been the same ever since .. he says he dont remember that whole week
Is it me tripping or Campbell looks like he still go to high school parties😂😂😂😂😂
This Ryan gives problems to Haney
When you see this makes you instantly want to box
It’s crazy cause he got knocked down in  round 2 in 2 of his professional fights  like Tank Davis and Luke Campbell
That's what a full 140 Ryan can go do to tank but of court he was scared and did all this clauses
WHOS HERE AFTER GARCIA vs DUARTE PRESS CONFERENCE
Lol well old tank showed him what that feels like.
Ryan dropped his guard, as soon as Campbell fired that shot to the body, and left hook to the head. That's where's he messed up.
Ryan Garcia is a gifted fighter. He should talk less, fight more, and put everything into maintaining focus. He needs a no-nonsense trainer, a sports psychologist, and in two years he will be the best in the business. But if he wanders around without discipline, it will be hit and miss. I don't think Derrick James' gym is the right place for him. Too many distractions, too much uncontrolled ego with those fighters-- he never should have left Eddie Reynoso. We'll see where this goes.
Why you didn't fight like this against the monkey gervonta
Davis used Garcias own move against him, props
❤
Gervonta Davis vs Ryan Garcia is so similar to this fight against Luke Campbell. Here is profl  Ryan Garcia got knock down in 2nd Round and ended in 7th Round with a K.O but the only difference is, Ryan loses this time. Mind blowing :^O
BRO NO WAY DUDE'S GETTING  COMBO  AND PUNCHED BY RYAN BRO GETTING KNOCKED OUT HE'S SO EZ TO DEFEAT BRO HAS NO FEATS ONLY SPEED HE CANT BOX
And here it is two years later, and Ryan Garcia was stopped with a vicious shot right to the liver
Ryan has terrible footwork amateur looking.. smh
If you notice, tank got Ryan the same way Luke Campbell got Ryan in round 2. Both of these situations in round 2.   Than, in around 7, The same way Ryan got Luke, Tank got Ryan. Both in the same round. Round 7.   Anybody into Conspiracy theories?!
Ryan best asset is his quick hands. Foot work, head movement and ring iq needs improvement. Else, his just another boxer with quick hands.
Every  fight he looks so confused why
Who eles here after the tank fight🗿
Exact same thing happened to Garcia vs Tank
Ironic that Garcia got knocked out the same way against Davis in the same round too, around the same time.
ryan garcia  demostro que es un boxeador que pega fuerte,pero no le alcanzo con davies y conta campbell mordio la lona,un inflado
He taste of own medecine
That was a left! The same thing kept his right hand down! The kid has not learned. Saw a video of his 1st trainer yelling at him to keep his right hand up!
HOWS THAT FOR SOME TASTE OF UR OWN MEDICANE TAAAAAAAANK, ROUND 7 TO BEAUTIFUL.
Nah staged the same round luke gave up 🤔 weird…
thats how ryan got hit by tank too😂
Even after watching the tank fight, Ryan biggest problem is defense. When his opponents are on the attack he put his hands in front of him instead of trying to cover his face or body up.
Who’s here after Ryan vs Tank
He is more focused on this fight than than the Tank Davis fight
Starting to become more apparent that Ryan has a glass jaw
painfull watching this after tank😔
Tanks shot was more like an uppercut left hook counter which is what caught Ryan. Luke and Tank threw two different shots that knocked Ryan down. Not the same punch as most are saying. Just my observation
I know luke campbell is probably so happy that he got his sweet revenge he literally lost the same exact way against tank
This a full circle moment in his life, knocks out cambell with a huge body shot, then gets hit in the same exact spot by tank and is unable to comitnue.
Now Ryan got dropped and tko by a body shot this aged well 😂😂
Crazy how Tank gave Garcia his first loss the same way he finished like Campbell .
Wow, just came back to watch this after his loss and what a horrible mistake it was to leave eddy and canelo. They looked out after him and brought out his best. Looks like Ryan has some calls to make… 🤦🏽‍♂️📞
Weird how similar this was to his fight with Tank
Body shot challenge is better when you don’t get hit
Tank Better 😭
Same round same thing , gervonta hit ryan's liver
The same is done to ryan today by tank 💪
Pocho es malísimo
Campbell was trying to get up from a liver shot...dancing on two knees...that is grit against all odds. Rising at 9 was royal.
If Ryan fought like this against Tank he would’ve prob won bru
2 years after and this is how Ryan went down. Viscous body shot from Tank. Talk about the irony...
Cool 21:13 apr 23 2023
It's ironic that he lost today due to a liver shot
Bro lost the same way he won this fight😭😭💤
Crazy how that body shot to Campbell is wat took out Ryan against Davis!
Who is here after tank davies body shot
RD 2 = both Campbell and Davis knocked down Garcia with a punch to the head  RD7 = Garcia knocked out Campbell with a liver shot. The same shot from Davis that knocked out Garcia. Both in round 7  What a coincidence.
Who else here after Tank beat Garcia with the same liver shot Garcia used to beat Campbell
Has anyone noticed Ryan got Luke with the liver shot round 7 at 1:17 and Tank got Ryan with the same liver shot round 7 at 1:17 ? Crazy 😭😭 wild 🤷🏻‍♂️ maybe rigged !!
ow
Came back from Ryan vs tank fight I was team tank and that was rigged 💯 this was a liver shot not that other weak shot tank did!
😂😂😂😂 Tank took advantage of Ryan's weak spot
The boxing gods delivered karma tonight
Same body shot  tank took Ryan down with tough shot to recover from for sure
how garcia win and knock down for the first time same as tank did to him today 😮
Who else here to heal after the loss😞
That was a type of hit a lot of other dudes don't even get up from. He set him up, he fell for it and got caught
campbell reminds me of a skinny marvin vettori lool
Dumb officiating. It was clearly a low blow.
Here the Saturday morning before the fight between him and Tank!!
He is not going to survive TANK
Ryan stands straight up like the statue of liberty 🗽 🤣
That was a massive shot, you can see waves as power result in Campbell body
Ryan haters: if Campbell could’ve knocked him out he would’ve won the fight 😂😂😂😂
who watching their fights before placing bets 😅
Ryan's right cross is deadly too after watching this 5 times
Tank gonna ko ryan
if tank hits ryan like campbell connected on the knockdown he wont be getting back up..
Si no mejora su guardia este sábado 22 va a recibir una paliza de parte de tank
Garcia no head movement and hardly any footwork.
If Tank landed that he would be sleep for weeks
Here after Tank asked Ryan if he hits harder than Luke Campbell
He’s gonna get caught with a hook if he starts coming in like that against tank
If tank hits him anywhere close to that it's over
imagine tank landing one of those
That was a mean body shot that’s shows Ryan’s no joke
Tank gone all over this boy
This guy can push 😂🤝
Aprovecha  cada instante
luke Campbell was not on shape he was absolutely gassed by the 2nd rd breathing super hard body was super red from lack of air he was ready gor the fight to be over
Ryan will be save by the bell and finish Tank in the next round
This is the guy that’s supposed to beat tank 😂😂😂
I’m here because of the Gervonta Davis vs. Ryan Garcia fight🥊
garcias mouth open already by round two. Most people dont understand boxing
garcia has not gotten any better since this fight
García can take a big punch, so who is next??? Davis, the big puncher, but enought for García?? I don't think so
ryan's sneaky hook is vicious
What a beautiful liver shot. This dude has so much potential I hope he doesn't get distracted.
One hella of a fight this coming weekend!
Tank by mo Murda mo Murda Murda
Tank going to punish this guy with 8 rounds of pain
If Garcia gets hit by tank Davis left he ain’t getting up
Campbell don’t have the power tank has but tank don’t have the reach Campbell has.. we underestimate ryans footwork he knows how to keep his distance. Honestly everyone feels like Ryan’s an easy fight for tank but nah if tank gets the KO it really shows how great tank is.
tank by ko
Ryan's footwork is too slow for Tank. Tank will cover the distance and steam roll the young Ryan in under 6 rounds.
Come on now got dropped by Luke Campbell
An y’all think this Gona beat tank 🤦🏾‍♂️
all i can say is ryan got heart, not many so called future star can bounce up like that from a knockdown and be so composed
He hit him in the kidney
key for Davis is to not tire, what a fight it'll be
Let David catch Garcia with uppercut he is not getting back up
I felt like Ryan looks a little bit flat footed. I think he would need to move a bit more with Tank. Also Luke set him up so easily punching down low a few times and then faking it and going to the head
Aquí de come papas
Will Tank take notes? Did Ryan learn from this? Tank is southpaw too
Ryan is so off balance
Esque García no arriesga ese golpe le vino por estar corriendo asia atrás mientras el pele así estará casi noqueado yermonta Nole vas aperdonar estos errores
Ryan please don't forget fight like this with Tank. It's a open and closed match if you do
I like this kid, but I have to be honest. It’s an easy fight for TANK…
HES ASKING QUESTIONS
best fighters tbh p4p
If that was Tank knocking em down not so sure Ryan gonna stand in the paint and fight if he gets up from it .
Yeah tank knocking him out 7th or 8th
He was supposed to throw that left hand over his stomach smh that’s why they tell you to do that he learned the hard way
Davis will get hurt just as badly. He has no defence and is a slow starter.
The fact Ryan don’t train with canelos team idk they were the best for him kept him very focused
Ryan is flat footed but punches hard ... This may be bad traits when he fight Tank
Garcia fight like a GIRL!
This fight looks choreographed.. but whatever
ryan garcia = 1 trick pony
This has 20,000,000 views on Dazn, but the replay of the KO on Dazn has 640,000 views. How? 20,000,000 views is more than Fury vs Wilder has on Fox. Especially when there are only about 10 in the crowd here. Crazy.
У Гарсии ноги как бетон,не умеет передвигатся ни как !
He may not of finished Garcia but he definitely should of jumped on him for 10 0r 20 seconds after the knockdown
They can’t fight
People don't seem to realize that Campell is an olympic gold medalist. The caliber of this fight is as elite as it gets
Garcia has the Mexican Spirt get knocked out get up and go for the knock out
I like that Ryan got that dog in him
6:00 why’s the ref letting him headlock him like that with no warning?
Garcia punches look weak he’s not knocking out anybody with some true skill
Ryan is in BIG trouble against tank. He constantly reverts back to his left hook and has no serious jab to speak of. He tosses out his jab very lazy because he is constantly looking for the left hook. He needs to learn how to set it up off other punches. I truly believe Ryan gets stopped by the 8th round and that's only because Tank is so patient.
Nice hook to the body. Tank via 8 round ko!
If garlic doesn't roll with tanks punches and move his feet back hes gone!
Man Ryan not ready for tank. All the boxers tank fought probably can bet Ryan
I've become a Garcia fan man he's great! Such speed, agility, and power.
Wao I think tank will ko garcia .
I fear Not The Man Who Has practice 10,000 Kick Once, But I Fear The Who Has practice One Kick 10,000 Times. Facts RIP Legend Bruce Lee will never be forgotten . .🐉🙏🙏I believe that Ryan practice that left hook 10,000 times 😳
U cant do that to tank davis,i told u on april 22
Was an exciting fight to watch live, amazing fight.
He must have freakish power.
REPLY IF RYAN GARCIA IS YOUR "KING RY"----------- "LIKE" IF YOU THINK HE'S OVER-HYPED.  👈👈👀👀
Imagine gervonta vs cambell
Feinted him before that body shot.
The thing about Garcia I see is his lack of patience to pick his shots. His flurries are nice but he tends to loop his punches. That split second opening is all tank needs to catch him. A nice tight counter would put him down quick. Almost in a similar way Campbell did. And defensively... Well, that's what I mean. He will get caught eventually.
Tank will hit him with the same punch but this time he won't get up. 5th round stoppage
When you have a left hook that devastating that ends fights to the body and head then anyone can get dropped. Tank has things to worry about.
Luke took a dive
Tank third round KO April 22 this dude won’t stand a chance with a real fighter 🦍🦍🦍
That body shot was VICIOUS 😮‍💨
If he stays flat footed against tank,tanks gunna piece him up
That knock down gave ryan garcia mental health problems
Tank win
Look at that knock down in round 2. Campbell caught him clean on the chin. Not every fighter is getting up from that. How did Ryan respond? He got up and took the fight to Campbell. He has heart. Yes, Tank should be the favorite in their fight, but people are acting like Ryan has no chance to win……that’s crazy!
soon this garcia will fall
He proved in this fight he can’t deal with tank I was for him till I saw this fight.the way he celebrated is like he was surprised to win
I wanna see Garcia vs Inoue. That fight would be great
Very immature boxing from Ryan,
I will say tho that was a mean body shot still tank all day tho fytb
Phony
Ryan wouldn't have got up afterwards if this was tank 🤣
Tank's never been knocked down before remember that
My money is on Tank.
Why Campbell didn't go for the throat after he knocked him down is beyond me. 🤔
The thumbnail alone shows u Ryan SHOULDNT be fighting tank..😢
The knock down woke Ryan up. It was a flash knockdown. Afterwards, Ryan was on 🔥. Luke somehow gave Ryan too much respect?🤔
Onething i like about Ryan he really does have that dog inem,it just hasnt showed just yet ,we saw if glimpse of it in this fight,i think we gonna see the real dog against tank.
No match for tank
У Кемпбелла нету выносливости и духом слаб. Надо было рисковать и спуртовать после точного попадания. А так…
the champs need to be able  take pressure but Ryan doe't...
Anyone else ask why Campbell didn’t go to the finish ??
Ryan will destroy tank
Looked like he broke his rib
Now just pause for a moment......He gets caught a few times with the straight left including the knockdown Now imagine Tank hitting him with that left ! Night Night
People criticize Ryan because of the knock down but nobody talks about how quickly he recovers from that the knock down was just an accident no problem 👍
I've never seen Tank hit the canvas like this clown- all bark no bite
And some people will act like this was a "Path of least resistance" fight for Ryan smh lol.
Clearly Tank will be the one filling in all those empty seats I suppose Are Ryan social media fan list legit???
QUE  BUENISIMA  ESTA  PELEA  DE  GARCIA  COMO TODAS  LAS  DE  EL    TIENE  MADERA  DE  GANADOR  MUNDIAL  SI  SIGE  ASI  LLEGARA  MUYYY  ALTO.  NOMAS QUE NO  HECHE  APERDER  SU  VIDA  EN  EXESOS  DE   GUSTOS.   ESTE  ME  RECUERDA  AL  FAMODO  Y  GRANDIOSO  PELEADOR  MEXICANO    SALVADOR   SANCHES  MEXICANO.
Going off the 4 and 5th rounds Davis is not going to have any problems with this young man. Ryan is faster but not but much. When it comes to the actual footwork Davis is vastly superior. This statement was made from an observational standpoint. Multiplied by RG saying this was his toughest fight. This young man is in trouble.
His best win as of now
Ryan def has the attributes to beat tank.  This fight he was pulling straight back too much and regrouping his hands while doing so which caused him to get put down.  I seen in his most recent fight it looks like he corrected it for the most part.    I feel like tank will use the ring and have ryan chase him and catch him like he did with rollie
Que mala pelea dio Ryan, limitado en su golpeo, tiende a querer castigar la cabeza demasiadas y repetitivas veces, olvidando por completo el castigo al abdomen, me refiero a que debió terminar la pelea mucho antes, también tiene un defecto al no llevar bien la distancia larga con respecto a su contrincante, el golpe que lo tiro a la lona fue desde larga distancia con una finta. Si no mejora su defensa no tendrá oportunidad contra Gervonta. Ojala y analicen la pelea a fondo si el chico sale a pelea directa y de golpes directos contra Gervonta se lo va a comer vivo, deben mejorar con urgencia su movimiento de pies y defensa de cintura.
How many people came here during the hype of Tank Vs Ryan.... lol... that Knock out on garcia of Campbell was clean af..now imagine a uppercut or same punch from Geovante... phew gracia is out like a light 💤 😴
A minute before Ryan hit him with that body shot Ryan new that body shot was ther he position him right were he wanted smart
That knockdown was maybe the best thing ever to happen to Garcia cuz he came out in the fourth w/ those hands so high it look like he was lookin through jail bars
The "Tank" is coming.
Gevonta pegar o Ryan ele mata…
He gone get beat up by tank watching these even more proof this kid had no power
People have hope for Ryan I get it but Tank is going to stop this dude regardless of your optimism.
수준낮네
That was some body shot, fair play to Campbell he did well
It would be nice to see some humility in athletes!!!
This video has 20 million views and look how empty that arena was. Crazy
Nice
Campbell has not heart Didn’t show desire to win.
Don't what Ryan Garcia trainer Is hinking about sending him with the Tank Davis, am affraid that Gervonta might damage him so bad that, never fight again, he's still a Little kids infront off Gervonta, but we see
Kalau bertemu gervonta Davis begini mainnya Garcia..habislah Ryan garcia
Credit to him for getting straight up and going to work. He won’t get up if tank lands though
I hope he don't let Tank hit him with a open shot like that😮
If only luke would’ve been just a little bit more aggressive he would’ve took Garcia out
Those tanks favorite shots. He throws those and uppercuts way more than Campbell.
Isa cruse hit harder than Ryan Garcia. Tank took every punch and still won . Long live Ryan 😂
Luke should have finished him off, he should have got on him and threw a whole lot of punches and got the stoppage, but he backed off and kept boxing.
I’m in tears watching this again! Way to respond to adversity kid!!
Ryan didn’t even look when he threw that body shot.
Tank is about to knock Ryan out cold. Ryan fights in terrible position
Ryan punch and don’t move out the way tank will capitalize on that
Campbell was winning the fight before he got knocked down
Campbell shoulda went in on him when he got u0 instead of taking it slow.... 1 wrong move cost him the whole fight
Vicious
2:39 so satisfying
I can't believe they just said "King Ryan".....  Does he have a belt?
Campbell was weak and tired.
Tank could land this combo easy
7:10 luke reminded ryan himself to go for the body
Son does costales para El pitbul
Le echaron un costal
Luke should’ve pushed the issue on the knockdown. Could’ve prolly got a stoppage!
7:10 ryan garcia gets hit with a body shot no,no,no that's not the way l'u show you how
ryan knew there is no need for another shot after that one
No dis to floyd mayweather or tito trinidad but Ryan G got the best check hook in boxing history.
Go job IdolGarcia!!!
Why was the announcer saying a left jab is the best weapon vs a south paw??? Im I missing something?
Campbell gave him a liver shot and then Ryan was like "o were playing that game huh.?"
The liver eaters
mah dude got kazuya punched
Против Джермонта не выстоят оба!
7:12
King eh?? 🤣
I’m taking Garcia against davis
คิดว่าตัวเองเหนือประมาณคู่ต่อสู้เกินไป
imagine if campbell did hold back his right
I Love Ryan. He is a beast and NO DOUBT THE FUTURE CHAMP
I want to see part 2
Ryan garcia don't got nothing on davis
No.chance against gervonta
Yeah he doesn't want to get hit by TANK like that
Watching that body shot made my side hurt. Just thinking of that punch to my ribs ☠️
That Fierce king went down!!!
Liver punch
He took the body shot like a Champbell
Dammm KingRy beat up Campbell easy  7:12 😴💤
I hope someone can beat ryan garcia
falta que le pongan un buen rival
In my younger boxing days I've gotten hit with some of those, your brain wants to get up but your body just wants to take a nap.
even befpre the luke put him down ryan was pretty much winning
Most Unexpected Punch, BODY SHOT!!!!! B.D.E.
Those body shots must hurt 🔥
Dropped by luke campbell 😂how the fk did garcia ever gain any kind of popularity its crazy
Garcia vs Crawford
Fight Terence Bud Crawford now that’s a fight I’ll pay to see
That KO. Ryan moves looks like Algerie getting hit by Pac on the chin
My g
2:36 ryan
he’s fast, but he’s not smart
Man, once Ryan learns to move sideways, both him and his head, he is going to be unstoppable.  He has some of the best hands, if not the best out there.  The kid can punch!  Once they start coming from different angles while at the same time protecting his head better, he is going to be the next Pacman.
No way garcia is winning against gevonte
Ryan the Glass Jaw Garcia
Garcia should stay away from Tank. Tank will embarrass him
7:35 sus
Ryan's quick recovery from his first time knockdown was very impressive.
Ini bukti kl au dia blm bisa menghadapi tank davids
So many empty seats
BEAUTIFUL FIGHT PROPS TO BOTH BOXERS BOTH MADE SUCH AN ENTERTAINING FIGHT Definitely WORTH MY MONEY
Garcia pelea con la guardia demasiado baja, abusado.
No body goes to Ryan fight
Garcia is the version 2.0 of amir "chin" khan ...
Ese Campbell, casi lo noquea ,y lo curioso es que después de tirarlo al suelo NO lo ataco para nada ,sospechoso
Garcia glass chin
This is Ryan’s best fight
Boots and King Ryan will not ONLY Be two of the PFP Bests of their Era's...but will possibly also meet in the ring one day.
Worst thing about this fight was no one gave Campbell a chance, talking like he was some journeyman, the commentators were a disgrace with how biased they were talking about Campbell only winning 1 round😂 the fight was a lot closer & up until that punch in the 7th round it could’ve gone either way, Garcia is a special talented boxer, but Campbell deserved more respect than he was shown that day, brilliant fight though
2:39
Campbell dumb I would of gave him everything I had after I knocked him down
Ryan you go hums🖕👌
I think n mebbe I say ; He's 1 'f mst famous  Body Shots knockdowns...definetly mebbe after all jjjj if dat made any sense hhh!!!
Awsm Match...Even Gr8R 🙌
That Knock down was Crazy 😳
Рекламны өлгенше тыққыштап бүкіл кайфты құртты 😡😏
Kesini gara" tiktok 😭🗿
Fun fact: Micky Ward knocked out Alfonso Sanchez with the exact same body shot on round 7 with 1 minute and 17 seconds left in 1997!
Had to put the video on 0,5x to see those punches
Talk about ryan getting gravy for himself. Send in a shorty beast it be game over
Tank is Going to Punish him 😂
wooow ryan g got busted out my son is alwas vote for you ryan
7:38

If tank hits ryan like that he ain't getting up
Dukot punch!
Imagine if tank ever hit Ryan 🤣😭🤣
It’s crazy how much Ryan improved just from this and the tagoe fight to now after knocking out fortuna . Run on sentence was crucial my fault
El pitbull lo ko facil
“Start pressurizing” 😂
Amir khan 2.0
Pelea falsa como las de canelo y de la Hoya pitbull lo acaba
Listening to the commentators in this fight was 🤢🤮! mea sententia sine firmis 🦂
This guy thinks he wants to fight Tank he will get smoked
Este boxeador Ryan García va a llegar lejos, lo tumbaron, se levantó y siguió contragolpeando al oponente.
The fact that Luke Campbell did the chest punch first lol
Luke is 33 but looks like a 17 year old high schooler😂😂
Luke get ducked up 😂😂😂
Menang kebetulan
7:58 Looks at that right hand.. looks like ''FINALLY!!!
Andito ako dahil sa fb sabi kasi dito kukunin yung sampung libo
manny ?
garcia  fight only low class fighter
He was that happy after beating somebody with no skills🤣 I’m not hating on you Ryan it’s just you overrated
Can someone tag the moment that Campbell knockouted Garcia
This boy not ready for Tank😁🤣
HAHAHA GARCIA KISSED THE FLOOR WITH ONE PUNCH.
One thing for sure, Ryan Garcia better stay clear of Tank Davis. Tank is way out of his league
Look like 2 amateur fighters. How you flex after getting knoxked tf down
Weak
And now more talk ryan!😂
Give the young lad credit he took that punch very very well
Lol nobody hardly at this fight! But yet Tank selling out arenas!! Lol
No way he survives Tank. If it happens
Hahahaha.  Round 2. Lols.
Finally somebody put him down
Am I the only one that’s not buying in Garcia hype??
I always wonder why a boxer with reach and height like Ryan has no jab? He just use that left hand as a measuring stick. He will benefit with that reach if he has a stiff jab along with his devastating left hook.
Garcia will never fight tank, Loma, or Haney. I feel like none of them will fight each other and it's probably the most exciting division right now in boxing
And now you see why this guy only fights store clerks.
If Cambell was Tank, Ryan would've been done.
Hope he learned that tank will do worse
how are they 5 10 but 135 pounds they are so small
When Tank caught Ryan tho, Ryan ain't getting up
If campbell was a better closer garcia would have that L
ryan got rocked he better be lucky that wasn,t tank he would have went to sleep
ซีโครงแทบหัก
You get caught by tank like that goodnight bro 🦾🦾🦾🦾🦾
If he fights tank, he should use his height advantage, defense, head movement and be less aggressive. I still see tank would dominate over him if he fights like this.
Big mouth Garcia. Arrogant a?? 😏
N u calling for Tank? Yea I can’t wait for that fight!!! Let’s go Tank!!!
Why was he riding reynoso like that
Hope garcia is allot better now.. Tank would've knock this garcia to the moon
Ryan got a weak chin. Tank would put that boy in a coma
That body shot was lethal asf
Getting knocked down by a nobody... Davis will have a field day...
Campbell don’t hit harder than tank so imagine Ryan getting hit by tank d
That body shot was amazing kudos to ry. He coming.
Campbell should have followed up and finished the job! Why didn't he use his jab!
fast but not accurate
and then you want to go out with pacquiao ? 🤦
And people say this dude is ready for Tank.. lol
Thats me ryan garcia i am the boss
And he want to fight tank,
This is why Ryan scare of Tank.. that left hook.
They think Garcia the next De La Hoya haha
A LOT of people are talking about how bad a liver shot like that hurts.......and yes it does. That said it's a true testament to how strong Arturo Gatti is for getting back up after Mickey Ward BLASTED him with that left hook to the body.
No respect for Campbell in the crowd...nasty
Campbell a quitter, balerina ryan needs to fight some real opponents like cruz
low quality video... headache
Ryan chin is glass, he better protect than pretty little thang if he face Tank!
this has sooo many views
Ryan is like Roy Jones, Power speed, ZERO CHIN
Man tank will beat the brakes off Ryan
Ringside guy is an idiot.  Campbell’s mistake was not going harder after the knockdown.
Am I tripping? Does anyone else remember Ryan Garcia falling to his face for a second then waking up? In this clip he pops right back up that is not the way I remembered it, Mandela effect strikes again! LOL
Theres a massive difference when you're not based in America its a much more relaxed style Luke should go and train there to get a real feel he needs it
Lol If Garcia would’ve been tagged like that by Tank or Teo he wouldn’t had gotten back up. Js
Ryan has no killer instinct. If he did he would've smashed him again after Campbell was frozen from the body shot. It's just a matter of time before Ryan is KO'd in humiliating fashion. Pitbull would've finished Ryan when he was wobbled.
Ryan will outclass Gervonta Davis
Its only a matter of time before he gets exposed. Kid has a glass chin.
Ryan García eres una mentira
3:36 dakiti by bad bunny lol
Not canelo clapping, “ As you should MIJO✨”
Rated ' PG '
Nothing but a 🤡
Mis respetos tiene corazón El Niño 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Ryan is a beast and tank better not trying to postpone a f8ghr for next year Cayce he won't win in. Better set up now for a trilogy with Ryan. Win maybe now loose the next and the next mark my words.
The way he celebrates is so unusual, no composure or nothing
5:35
GARSIAS ESTA COCINAHO NO DEJES Q C RECUPERE BIENE LA PARTE FISICA Q TRABAJE ASLO TRABAJAR YA ES TUYO.
EVIDENTEMENTE NO FALLA VAS AVAJO Y HABRES ARRIVA.CUANDO ENTRAS AL MENOS COMBINA 3 VAN VAN VAN Y SALE CUALKIER FALLO TERMINALO.
majestueux Ryan Garcia
I'm addicted to watch this sport.
권아솔이랑 붙으면 되겠구만 주댕이파이터 아솔이는 이긴다
So satisfying to see him get knocked down
hahaha! a 33yrs old guy learned something from a 22yrs old Ryan Garcia xD...   Campbell throw the luckiest punch against Garcia but no follow-up was the biggest mistake..
Forgot covid was a thing… wondering why the seats were so empty lol
This formula called speed+power=result
“The kid knocks the kid down” the commentators are really adamant on calling them kids just to feel better about themselves
Rain Garcia invites you to a fight with Shahjahon Ergashev
Why did the ref count so fast
Could you all stop with the racist Mexican comments?  Most of us don't  care to hear then. How about commenting on the fight instead.
El británico pudo ganar la pelea si no se hubiera echo menos.  Hasta me deja pensando que se detuvo para no hacer quedar mal al favorito.
That's how you rise from one of your hardest fall.
Estaba cagado de miedo Campbell, no tiene huevos de mexicano! Pit bull destrozara a García!
The way Garcia's arm got caught behind his back I thought he was done
Who's here after h3?
Campbel is a paid actor 🤣
I want to look ryan vs jake please
No matter what criticism anyone can make about him, he’s got the goods and can win the world title if he wants to. Speed, power, talent and he can take a solid one if it comes down to it. He’s been training with Canelo too so he’s only gotten better. Coming straight out the garage to a world stage.
Ryan definitely got knocked out for a sec there or he wouldn’t have dropped.
2:55 Campbell should've rush in all his energy and finish him
man ryan has went back so much he’s so much worse now looking at this fight compared to yesterday smh
Donaire vs Garcia pls
Any opportunity the ref gets he will end it early just like for Anthony Joshua
Tough kid must say
Do me a favor count garcia jabs there’s like 4 on the whole fight he needs to learn that otherwise the oponent takes control
Beautiful punch. Not lucky either, that punch was there for him all day
That hit look sus ngl
I go down by liver shots too. Just not in boxing
that body punch looks terifying on slow motion. didnt realized it was that hard.
Campbell need to get some training from crawford how to attack opponent after a knockdown
And that combo will always work….body head. That’s how you drop the arms.
For the debate who has done more so far, Luke Campbell gold medalist still had something under the hood caught ryan clean ryan got up and threw back proved that he didn't need a bell to save em but his will 😂 and Luke is the better victory then any of devin lameys last 3 opponents just facts  PS YES LAMEY Ryan garcia actually has power in those fist🔋 🤭
Ryan can do it on his own!
Fk De La Hoya
2nd round where luke know he messed up
Idk he not ready for tank
Campbell should have poured it on guy fought way too defensive. Garcia used to being the aggressor but he hasnt faced anyone actively rushing him and pushing him into corners throwing big heavy flurries
They didn’t train Campbell how to finish a person he was supposed to finish Ryan a more season fighter would’ve been all over Ryan
Garcia have to train  chin. Because next lvl  its another lvl like mannys stage
Awesome fighter. Shows heart !! Nice !!
García tiene todo para ser la nueva estrella mundial del box pero algien con tanta popularidad tambien tiene muchas distracciones si logra enfocarse mas al box puede llegar a ser el nuevo paquiao o Chávez si se consentra
Вы что не видите,бой куплен Кембелу сказали проиграть. Нужно было раскрутиь второго золотого мальчика.
wahaha where is your garcia be coming by next pacquao hahahahah
He took that punch well
Every now and then boxing throws up a guy that really should have been and deserved to be  a world champion. Luke Campbell lost fair and square , no complaints. Garcia is a seriously hot prospect. Have so much time for Campbell , and in another era he would have achieved his dreams. Loving watching Garcia grow.
Ryan Garcia 👍👍
Boxing
라이언 가르시아 맷집 좋네.... 훅 제대로들어갔는데
And the HATE continues SMH!
What Ryan think Tanks going to do bet he doesn’t get up from one of Tank’s joints watch and see everyone
I love his style, makes me wonder if I can fight Ryan someday
BEAUTIFUL, I MEAN GORGEOUS...LEFT HOOK TO THE BODY!!!
You people calling this kid a YouTube boxer is a f****** shame he has a speedy power
Ryan all talk I truly believe is not going to last
If he stands up hel be dead in second shot
Wasted talent 🤦‍♂️😢
Ryan Garcia needs to work on his footwork. He’s flat footed.
Ese muchacho no trae nada para el canelo
Y quiere al kanelo García 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
El entranar con el edy, le quito huevos a garcia
"He is asking questions" 😂😂😂
Ryan future legendary boxer
🤣🤣🤣 Quijada de cristal
В Украине ракетами фашисты россияне убивают наших детей! Но мы не здадимся! Слава Украине!🇺🇦🇺🇦
Esa mandíbula de García no aguanta mucho:🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽😎
the ref wearing a mask but no gloves and touching his mask. hahaha. silly.
7:38
Garcia has the most deadly check hook we’ve seen since Mayweather!
2:39 7:13
I'll be honest, I don't see him beating Tank. His movement isnt refined enough, needs more time.
I always heard a left hook and straight right is best against southpaws.
Inoue, Garcia and Canelo are the only worthwhile fighters
Until the tank Davis flattens his scrawny qss
he fights like ippo!
Tank by 6 round KO 😂
British brother campell
Cambell expected a hook to the head and guarded accordingly but it was a deceptive liver shot..
He's actually Oscar De Lahoyas long lost love child... hopefully he's not a cokehead like Oscar too
seem like the commentators disliked garcia hahaha
the fact that Ryan didn’t put all his power behind that punch is crazy
Guzel teşekkürler
That whole division is full of ducks 🦆 Devin ,tank , Ryan ducking each other is a shame Idk why everyone has Mayweather syndrome some of the best boxers in history had losses. But now everyone wants to remain undefeated by fighting nobody’s
He is the best fighter😃👍💪⭐
If the kid (Garcia) stays in shape and keeps his nose clean he could surpass DeLaHoya. I Loved watching Oscar when he was young but I think Garcia has something more.
18m views. Compared to other top dogs fight, i think Garcia still the most bankable fighter in the division,. Anyone would say otherwise has a problem in percepring reality. Wonders of social media i guess. Apparently, social media following is more relevant now than titles.
First time for everything, he's going to need to train harder for his next future fights.
If Tank gets a shot at his jaw like that, he will send that thing into the 9th row. It was a nice finish by Garcia tho.
Ryan was not hurt at all it was the terrible footwork that knocked him off balance.
Wlng footwork taas ng ambisyon nito lumaban ky Pacquiao kbaong ka dun boy 😅
Garcia is the goat speed and power
ESE JOVEN GARCIA EN CUANTO ENFRENTE UN CLAVO CALIENTE, TENDRA PROBLEMAS. ESA ALEGRIA EXPLOSIVA DESPUES DEL KO. MUESTRA LO INSEGURO QUE ESTABA ANTES Y DURANTE LA PELEA. FUE UN GOLPE DE SUERTE QUE CAYO EN EL SITIO EXACTO. TODAVIA NO ESTA LISTO PARA GRANDES COMBATES. CREO DEBERIA PERDER CON GERVONTA Y PITBULL. SALUDOS DESDE ANACO-VENEZUELA.
Luke’s left was absolutely perfectly timed.  Great comeback win for Ryan.
Ryan pumping his fist saying “I got him”
Observing how that body shot was performed frame-by-frame is so satisfying to watch. Campbell being able to stand, although a second too late, from that terrifying blow is also commendable.
Respect to campbell too he was a decent fighter
Лев🦁👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Fold him in half like an origami.
This was  Garcías best body punch challenge
ryan depois do knockdown voltou insano kkk, brabo dms.
4:48
7:09
Tanto potencial tirado a la basura🙁
Galing
Bad footwork from Ryan Garcia
Ryan is no match for Tank
HAHAHA Queen garcia
Quijada de baby baby girl
They both seem really young
Luke Campbell still legend.
😳 Tricked match!
Dynamite in that Left
I'm a Ryan Garcia fan but seems like he put his boxing career on hold to sell soap  Get in the ring already
It proves again and again that clumsy footwork is fatal to any boxer. You can't just walk around, push forward and try to use your hand speed and power to win. Ryan Garcia  has a glass jaw like Amir Khan too. LOL
RYAN GARCIA - PUT HIM NOW  ----- VS.   DAVIS, MATRIX, TLOPEZ,  -----  THEN TELL US IF THIS IS NOT A PROTECTED FIGHTER  IF HE WINS  VERSUS THE THREE  ELITE GUYS.
Got dat gameology intro
GERVONTA TANK DAVIS 💪💪💪💪💪💪💪JUARA RING 💪💪👍👍🤜🤜👏👏👏👏TAKAN TERKALAHKAN 👍👍👍👏👏
Lawan Ringan ini saja Ryan sudah jatuh 😂😂😀😀🙏🙏palagi mau  lawan  Gerfonta Daviskuat 💪💪🤜🤜Pukulan keras   Ryan kalah ko😀😀
💩👀
Garcia is over rated, cherry picking his fights
NO MAMES!!! Cambell subió a pelear MUERTO DE MIEDO!!!
If it wasnt for slow mo, theyd swear it was a fix
Louke stay like winnie de pu when put him down to Garcia.
Fue a tentear al oponente subio Cambell, u cuando lo tumba no va al remate, se hace fotos y selfin en redes, no joda ombe.
Ryan should wear pink when he fights real diva with a viscous left hook all that crying and celebrating over like Campbell
Crazy to know this was Ryan’s last fight.
I felt that
I hate these biased commentators I swear. Never gave Campbell  props when he repeatedly  landed beautiful combos, but of course talked up garcia any time he landed his shots. How annoying. Dickriders.
"He's Asking Questions " Cringe Commentator.
Campbell has been missing leg day since day 1
Hahaha I like Ryan Garcia but the guy is too emotional and childish 😂 someone need to put him in a real training camp. I don’t wanna say he’s soft but he doesn’t look hard then again he’s like an Oscar the la Hoya.
Garcia str8🚮🚮🚮🚮
IS RYAN READY TO FIGHT LOMACHENKO..??
Ryan Garcia is a great fighter that lacks courage
Ryan trash lol he only has a left hook
Le entró miedo a Campbell… Que se dedique a otra cosa…
2:40 Everyone was screaming or in shock 😂
Proves garcia has no chin
Brabo bravo
Las 18M vinieron sólo por esto 3:39
Ryan Garcia you are the best of the best 👌❤🙌♥💗💙👌❤
Ryan Garcia you are the best of the best 👌❤🙌♥💗💙👌❤🙌♥💗💙👌❤🙌♥💗💙👌❤🙌♥💗💙👌❤🙌♥💗💙👌❤🙌
Hehe ph boxers will stop him.
I don't know how boxers take those punches.
dropped by an average hook then comes back to drop luke who clearly wasnt here for a war as soon as he turned his back then talks about his win as if he is the greatest boxer in the world        jake paul impresses me more
Epstein didn't commit suicide
Dazn Rewind ► https://bit.ly/32iAaRT The DAZN Boxing Show ► https://bit.ly/3EQ70HN
More exciting and action than any heavyweight fight today. both fighters are great sportsmen
Ryan Garcia “the crystal jaw” 😂😭
Ryan just showed that Mexican fighting spirit. It's crazy!
I don’t like his personality but people seem to forget the skill and talent Ryan posses. I hope he gets back in the ring soon, it’s been over a year and the division is heating up 🔥
People say Millenials and Gen Z have no substance, the older generation is more tougher and can hang in adversity better, well there's your breakfast, lunch and dinner right here. How you like dem apples.
I can watch Ryan get knocked down all day!
ryan garcia. manihang nilalang
LEGENDS!!
Ryan fights Tank it’s 😴😴
Ryan is not one of the greats . He has  the Golden boy behind him and the media  making him look like a great boxer   . Money talks that's all. He will fall with a great hungry boxer
After rewatching this fight yea Ryan ain’t beating pit bull Cruz
This beautifull name Ryan garcia its have the most wies for all boxer everytime..ok 🤣🤣🤣
Caught him going straight back that’s a no no!plus as I keep stating he stands too straight up stands too tall somebody need correct it for the kid
Laser sharp 😂 it’s amazing nobody sees that Ryan needs make simple adjustment for longtime that is he stands too straight up I been seeing it since day one !its funny how arrogant he and other new fighters are Ryan. Despite athleticism is going get crush if well forget if bc he will be protected!
I wanna fight Garcia👊🏻 Not just a fight i’ll make him down on his knees forsure🥵
Me parece falso ese ko 🤔
NAO VI NADA DE MAIS NESSE CARA, SOU MAIS ROBSON CONSEICAO
Ryan Garcia at the age of 23: "Wins 21 boxing match with 0 loses"  Me a 20 years old: Playing minecraft and living an ordinary life with nothing to do.
6шлем 6gn800009її,.   9 лютого ' 9 лоььбюжэххэ8щют0зххздлоьттьог.  о pppkkk,,lp 5
Luke Campbell has a great reach but needs to use that reach much more to improve his game. No point trying to be a pocket fighter. You need to stick and move and use all the elements of having that reach advantage. Work that jab and master the uppercut catch the fighters that try to get in on inside
And he wants to fight Davis smh 🤷🏾‍♂️
I could see a drop of 💩 after the body shot. Who noticed this too?
i love you sam timtim
i love you ryan timtim
Ryan garcia vs naoya inoue 👌
Kids are so special today. Get bigger gloves. Or get hurt
Garcia Beats Tank
Ryan is a beast
7:38
Helal olsun garcia o korkağa yenilirsen üzülürdüm
Celebrating like he’s won a world title
Tank is scared of him 100%
Mandíbula de cristal garcia
When is your next fight? I'M GETTING OLD! Watchable fighters fight! Btw drop Golden Girl. He lead with his forehead too much.
7:39 👌👌🔥🔥the body shot oh my gosh😌😌😌
ryan is the goat ♣♥♥♥
Лома прикончит гарсию
Rayan garcia has a glass jaw camp bell is not even a power puncher and he get knockdown and garcia have tiny skinny legs
Still waiting for Ryan to fight again
I would like the kid more “Ryan” if he wore a little more humble
._. nmms y si se enfrentará al pitbull cruz está bien muerto Ryan García
Luke, i wish you would've knocked this kid out.
Got to give respect to garcia ....he hits to the body like a a hammer 🔨
Why is ducking Gervonte?
Ryan tho😳
Is the sanction fee the same for the franchise as the regular wbc title or is it more expensive? Since the fighter is allowed to fight bigger ppv fights.
Since this fight, all the other lightweights have been ducking Campbell 😂
Bueno el muchacho. ✊🏻
Ryan garcia cries like he defeated floyd Mayweather   Clown !!!
wow if ryan barely can deal wit this nobody ,, how he gonna handle davis?
Tank would destroy Garcia 😂😂😂
Y así se quiere poner con el Isaac pitbull
Please Rayan make a fight against Jake Paul you should beat that fake boxer
5:10 Luke almost kod saved by bell 🔔 was going out .
Ryan is a Teo Lopez, too cocky, hopefully Tank, takes care of him...👍🏽💪🏽💪🏽.. let's go Tank ..👍🏽
Should Canelo be rooting for campbell???
Since that knock down he hasn't fought anymore.
Garcia this is the beginning ..more to fight stronger fighter be prepared or else u will get knock out.
Haha mayabang Kasi
Ryan García sintió el verdadero terror
El mandíbula de cristal
I never saw Rayan hurt
And he wants to fight tank 😂😂
I didn't know Olympic champions raised their elbows when defending.
Ryan needed that knock down .. maybe that will calm him down a bit .. This guy Campbell needs more work …
Fantasy speed fight, Ryan Garcia VA Amir Khan, wanna see something 🤔
Ryan reminds me of great amir khan..
Si Ryan no se prepara con eces extilo le queda chiquito al pibull
luke looks like a nice dude; that body shot was mean!
Se desespera y pega alo loco manotazos
No sabe sacar los golpes bien JAJAJAJ necesita clases ryan
Parece un niño aprendiendo  ah boxear
Pinche pelea falsa
Su defensa muy deficiente lo bueno que no era noqueador el otro le entraron golpes muy fuertes sin movimiento en la sintura y muy frontal. Si no cambia la suerte se le termina.
Amazing garcia
If tank davis is the one who punched Garcia in the 2nd round  man it's over
Tank Davis would finish this kid!!😌
Con esa quijada de cristal ayy Ryan te va a matar el Pitbull cruz
Nice stage fight but Garcia will forever be the lame arrogant speedbag fraud 😂😂 they will pay a few fights and later one will KO him cold.
Weak Jaw Ryan got dropped
The queen ryan garcia😄
Ryan garcia will be a victim of his own false confidence...there is true confidence ( when you really have what it takes)...and there is false confidence( when you tell yourself your the best by beating mediocre fighters and then believing  everyone around you )... Its a matter of time, when a TRUE fighter is gonna expose him...badly.
Ryan Garcia the YouTube world champion, Hahahahah!!🤣
With left handed boxers that punch is totally effective
the end of Ryan's career
He fights like a little kid
Hey ryan you better clean up the 135 devision before you outgrow everyone
I can't believe this is a pro fight they fighting like silver gloves
Campbell: “throws bodyshot” Ryan: “now, my turn🦾”
Aquí mirando como pelea este muchacho que dice que va  a ganarle al Pitbull Cruz . Creo que sí se hace esa pelea ba hacer un evento que todos esperamos . Mi pronóstico es reservado creo que los 2 tienen mucho potencial para ganar .
the next amir khan
If he got drop by the other guys that he calling out he’s not gonna wake up.
Ahora va con PITBULL CRUZ ...😳Qe buena pelea va ser esa..ojalá  pitbull cruz  es ya más preparado porque este guey pega fuerte 🤕😳
I like Ryan better than Tank...Tank ran when he can't fight fair (toe to toe) just like Mayweather..Fraud Mayweather Promotion bribed all Judges to win..
Bet you couldn’t do that to gervonta
Liver shot!!!!!
Where is Ryan now scared to get back in the ring that knockdown shook the boy
Quijada de cristal jajaja
He pulled a canelo bro that’s why… I see greatness in this dudes future so best of luck to him
Quijada de cristal jajaaj
Pit bull Cruz will destroy pretty girl rayan
The glass chin kid 👦
Pitbull will beat this Ryan easy
Le pusieron un costal, así cualquiera
got caught clean and came back strong 🥊
Ryan Garcia merasa itulah adalah skill nya, padahal itu adalah ketapatan yg tak terduga...seandainya body shot tidak mengnai Cambel kemengan pasti sebaliknya
I’m not a fan off tank but Ryan definitely don’t need or want that fight because he could end up being another broner
Satisfactory gesture 👋 del Ryan over Campbell 👍.
Ryan Garcia same as amir Khan
well done Ryan I see your work more than just a ytb you got work
Scripted fight
EL QUIJADA DE CRISTAL JAJAJAJAJA
Vergazo Galactico
The fight that sent both into retirement 😂 💀
This was the Garcia I knew before hanging out with the fake Paul Brothers
Big mistake by campbel..he should rush garcia before recovery and now he lost that opportunity
VICIOUS body shot. phew..
Just luck Davis eat that boy 🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
2:39
And this was Garcias last fight ever it seems, great fight but the kid needs to stop talking and get in the ring again, it's almost been a full year
Kambosos Jr vs Garcia would be a fun fight to watch
Pure chicano power and mexican power
This was a great fight why was the crowd so quiet...oh yeah because there wearing a mouth cloth from CHINA......
Garcia insta boxer
Never see south paws coming definitely gave him a 🐾
Linares would beat Ryan by stoppage Haney would beat Ryan by decision  Lopez would beat Ryan by stoppage Davis would beat Ryan by KO  Loma would beat Ryan by decision  Shakur would beat Ryan by decision  Richard Commey would beat Ryan by stoppage  Kambosos would beat Ryan by stoppage  People he has a chance against:  Javier Fortuna  Jojo diaz  Masayoshi nakatani  Isaac cruz
This guy it s not ready for Gervonta ….. not now ……. Gervonta will eat him allive …
If he tried to go blow for blow with tank he wont survive m. Im sorry i dont care ab that speed shyt…he still hasnt really took a power punch
King RYE with the Body Work! 🥊🥊🥊🥊
Ryan does instagram more than fighting. This kid is very confusing.
Ryan G is quality to watch!
That body shot landed more flush than my toilet 🚽
Aww man, I saw the names and thought I was gonna see Uncle Luke throwing down, lol.
Para k vea k no vale verga
No va a pasar de las 50 peleas cuando lo knokeen a puros jabs y para atrás como Mayweather le pego al de los frijoles
He attacked
Me gusto cuando lo tumbaron 😂😂😂
Should have stormed in when he had Garcia on the deck.Hes a kid and was still dazed from that left hand shot but Campbell let him recover.
Gervonta abt to ko this man
sheeeeesh that hook at 5:24 almost iced Campbell, kid got power, lomachenko couldn't knock this guy and that's a fact, I still think that if Tank catches Ryan with that nasty left uppercut that is his signature punch, the fight is over...
Did Ryan quit fighting where is he come on man !! How about fighting wt. Choc !!!
Tank would’ve finish him
Garcia not ready he decent tho can’t c tank etc
гарсия - калл
Lunch meat for tank
His potential is absolutely insane. I hope he will really put the work and focus in to realize that potential. Kid is built to fight like Apollo Creed! Speed, power, size, reach, and he is a real fighter! If he cleans up his defense and footwork he will be an absolute nightmare.
Dang, Garcia got knocked out and came back
Ryan has a lot of weak points.. bad defense, slow, bad chin, flat feet.. if he ever face Gervonta is gonna get destroyed pinche pocho pendejo
davis vs garcia
definetelly Pitbull will kick the Ryan Garcia´ass
COMO PUEDEN CREER QUE ESTE CHICO ES TALENTOSO? NO TIENE CINTURA, NO TIENE FIT, NO TIENE MOVIMIENTOS.....SOLO VA PARADO Y TIRA GOLPES
Great chin and unbelievable body shot
ryan needs more time in the gym to learn better movement and stuff and try them on at least 3 fights and sparring b4 the davis fight cuz davis has ok movement  and being a south paw can catch ryan with a  punch like this , ryan is young so he still has alot to learn but same with what canelo said , TRAIN HARD AND TAKE NO BREAKS
And teofimo López now lol. What a clown. Learn some teofimo. From Ryan
can he fight some actual talent please and thanks
After seeing this, nah, he ain't ready for tank and haney😆go fight kambosos
Gracia is trash.. Internet troll
Ryan's weakness; flatfooted, chin... I don't know if he's ready for world champions.
Fake
Fake
Ryan is a top contender . Saddened me to see him stop for a bit.  He will be a champ in due time as he makes his comeback.
G🌈🦍🤣🥰🥰🥰🥰😊😊😅🌻🦌🐳🐳🐧🐧🐼🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳
Jesus loves you 😇😇
campbell didn't finish garcia after the knock down because that does not go with the plans they have for garcia
campbell could've taken garcia right after the second round knockout
Devin’s better
Ryan has a lot of talent. But the problem is talent can’t get you far without hard work and right now he’s not showing that he needs to take Canelos advice
Mad respect to this young guy,he went down got up got himself together and came bk and won by a knockout no decision, Garcia the real deal and he proved it with this fight,much respect
Ryan The InstaThot still ducking Tank !
No Mames conmadre
Quijada de cristal no llega lejos
Losing by a 22 year old kid definitely hurt more than his punches 😅😅
Man  if luke knocked down garcia i cant imagine what the Tank can do to this guy
Garcia should fight Teo
LIVEEEER BLOW !
That body shot in slow motion looked absolutely brutal all love to Ryan don’t get me wrong Luke threw a great left punch with a knock down but he needs to be more aggressive after moments like those
hahaha the scoreboard wer is the 10/8 round im confused!!!
George kambosos destroys Ryan
“ cambell got up from other body shots not Ryan’s” POWER
No other light weight’s body shots hit like Ryan’s invisible & powerful
Ryan’s hits are so powerful it’s intense u can hear the snap
You can literally hear the power behind Ryan’s punches
Ryan Garcia’s name is huge so with that comes more hate
People constantly hate on Ryan he’s young of course he’s on Instagram. But don’t take that away from him being very talented
Davis took 8 rounds to knock out a fighter  Took Ryan 1 round. People still doubt him
Ryan Garcia’s skill is no match with Teo or Kamboso.
Has Ryan lost a fight?  Why is he saying he wants a comeback fight??
garcia developed a mental problem after this fight. He must've been haunted by the knockdown
Codete  creído el tanque te rompe la madre
Gotta hand it to Garcia.
Ryan got the power and some skills.but if he fight Kambosos today?he will only eat dust. Kambosos speed footwork and combinations are not joke.better to preparefor it.
Now that teo lost ryan ain't looking that bad huh
Steve Fox
Ryan es un desastre
7:12
You got to give Campbell his credit for fighting a hard fought battle, the young man is a great warrior, actually both are, great hearts and Props to Ryan for getting knocked down and making a big comeback!!! We should all appreciate what these guys have done for entertaining us with style,grace and toughness, bravo to them!!!
If he got knocked down by luke Campbell he not gonna stand a chance again gtd if they ever fight
Who has Ryan Garcia fought no one he is doing nothing he is waiting for other to fight each other or like last night George beat Lopez and now Garcia sees this and is ready to want to fight for belts but if Lopez won the fight Garcia would not say he wants to fight Lopez would be Garcia is 23 and he is doing what canelo done waiting for fighters to rust or fighters to get upset it’s clear. If Luke can knock Garcia down like that image what tank Davis would do
The fight that turned Ryan into a diva
No head movement no feints needs way more work he would be smart to not take any fight with the top 5
Noes lo mismo dal y dal g teden no tiene kija lo coje uno con pegada jamas se levanta pajaritos ruruuu
Ryan will be a great fighter to watch. But if that was Tank Davis that landed tha punch that knocked him down i don't think he would  be getting up. Keep your hands up buddy
Ready to see what he's capable of when he has more footwork & head movement.
Luke with no killer instinct  Fight should of been over. Any top 5 ranked fighter finishes that fight 10/10 times
A lot of people are questioning if that was hard. Look at Campbell body, there is a mark of the punch.
Does being saved by the bell mean it can't interrupt the effects of a knock down punch or it can't interrupt the ref's count?  If the prior, seems Luke got saved by the bell, against the rule set... is it?
La mirada del muchacho l dice todo la  cague no letenia  que pegar tan fuerte    otro peleador huele sangre y selo acaba  y este solo le estire el Brazo ni el jab le Marco dio miedo de tumbarlo  de nuevo jaaas
I THINK LUKE LOSS HIS CHANCE AFTER KNOCKING DOWN GARCIA.HE WAS TOO PAASSIVE HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE AGGRESSIVE
This is the man right here boys
I didn't know DAZN showed "classic" fights, this is one that LA Guy used to fight....back in the day.
Ryan is a soft pretty boy
Whatever happened to a traditional boxing count
Ryan is such a talented fighter but even like canelo said he’s wasting his talent by getting lazy and needs to apply himself more.
Garcia looks better in red
BS
Luke Cambell looks like some 15 years old! I can`t beilive he`s 33
The last time we'll ever see this dude in a boxing match
Heavy weight boxers speed is slow light weight feather weight fighter are too fast
Garcia loose ...
HAHAHAHHAHA
Luke could of ended it easy if he continued the pressure gave the other fighter a chance to recover
Garcia got a lot of swag
He not ready for gervonta Davis
Like how both have their eyes closed in the thumbnail.
🇺🇸🤴
I fw Ryan Garcia but fighting like this he has no chance against tank Davis
7:38 DANG!  That's not just a body shot, but a  *Liver Blow* ... I've rather get hit in the head... At least those don't hurt anywhere near getting hit on the biggest internal organ that makes your body go "NOPE! That's it...."
LOL biggest fraud in boxing. he needs to hurry up and fight Tank so he can get KO’d
Es todo fake esto le ponen paquete para que suba los mas rapido a lafama y que gane dinero tanto como el y su representante si ustede ven bien el pibe le marca donde le tiene que pegar 1 segundo antes saludos
7:15 Canelos punch😎
KING of what Interim ? he faced all bums, can we test this King status?
Ryan was like HERE!!!!! yeah that’s what I do. Let that set in for second.
You could really see him trying his hardest to get up, but the lack of oxygen to the brain is keeping him down 7:18
Awesome fight
Ryans talented but in no way shape or form ican he stand up with some of the best lol.. Looks stiff out there
Lol 😂  on that Knock down is worth watching every time
YouTube is so shady I put in most resent fight and this i what showed up first
I thought he was going to puke. That was a nasty liver shot.
7:12 BEAUTIFUL shot
Ryan could’ve violated with his right hand after that body shot but he didn’t
I love this punch 😁😁😁
After this knockdown Ryan Garcia don’t wanna get hit like that anymore.
He gottt dropped
Ryan Garcia freaking out after the fight even though it was close and he got hard dropped…. He don’t got it.
Cero box de Ryan
Both of them box the way my grandma did when she caught flu
У Гарсии стать непобедимым супер чемпионом, ноль шансов... Защита нулевая...
Ryan Garcia is awesome!!!
Veo las peleas de hoy y nadie como Chávez que se metió al cuerpo a cuerpo dando golpes y buen boxeo y se adentraba hasta rematar y por ello era uno de los mejores noqueadores y claro , su puño de acero
He was up before 10 .. why did referee stop?
Ryan wants to be a you tube diva.
What a talent...!
A classic liver shot from Ryan Garcia. This proves how much of a hard worker and a talismatic sportsman he is ✅
Ryan knew the minute he hit him with that body shot that he was done! Ouch!
Ryan,just a gd fighter now..with time,he can become great..gd speed,power but lacks in defence..
He’s a runner he’s a track star
Look at Eddie 5:58 he was telling Ryan slow down
Vamos por gervonta champ
Great performance by both fighters. Ryan Garcia, text book work fake the jab, punish with a left hook to the liver.
Ryan is not elite he will get knock down
Tank, run for the hills. In 2 yrs,  its over
22 yrs old...sky's the limit
мощный тип ))
7:36 😭😭
This kid is fast and powerful.what seems normal punch knocks down his opponents very often.thats amazing.
Le aventaron un gran pelador a rayan
Canelo: one this with strong is force the
Luke is 33!?
Jesus paid my ticket:) yours too!
Ryan has terrible footwork
Jangan terlalu sombong dulu, baru ketemu cambel saja sdh jatuh seperti nangka masak, 😩😩😩
With all respect, it's about time he fought someone his height. And help the help of Canelo.
60 kg power. This division never brings bad fights.
Luke Campbell should have taken profit of the Slip Jab, he did not throw many in this fight.
Un gancho al estilo canelo
Ulasan yg kacau....
bros legs built like chopsticks
Garcia still has a long way to go
You don’t realize how hard they hit each other until you see the slow mo
what's the music used for the intro?
It disgusting he did not Deserve it
Ryan’s left hook is insane. I’ve been rooting for him ever since I heard of him way back I was waiting for his first fight that gave him adversity and he handled it amazingly love the future for him
17 million views, this boxer are most viewed,
Why did Campbell look around like that wasn’t supposed to happen lol
Inoue vs garcia what the experts think ?
8:15 Notice at the very end Oscar tells Bernard "That looked pretty familiar".
Gatti would've gone up from that only to expose his head while his body heals🥺🥺🥺
I think this the match he stop liking boxing 😂
Ryan is a late bloomer. He wont be in his prime till his late 20s and early 30s. All of the other guys at 135 are reaching their peak body level in their early 20s. So he needs a lot more time for his body to develop.
Fast count, tough shot but he could have continued, maybe 8 seconds, some guys get 15. Luck of the draw I suppose.
If tank catches Ryan like Luke did, I don’t think he gets up.
Garcia’s all hype
Not being funny but tank would destroy Ryan Garcia Ryan Garcia does not fight much and avoiding big fights
That left hook to the ribs, in slowmo. Sheeesh!
5:42 TANK WOULD'VE HIT HIM WITH THAT UPPERCUT RIGHT HERE THEN LIGHTS OUT
Ry gave the guys' Pancreas a little luv tap there.
You idiots missed the hit on the back of the head by Ryan on purpose huh
I don't get it why these yound guys stand up that fast. Take your time boy
Campbel should have ignored that body punch to garcia, garcia's punch in return became the reason for Knockout...
So fake lol
you here because of 2hype
Gy
Here from 2Hype
Left hook pivot counter beautiful
that punch woke me up
Ryan head hunts to much
That teenager wouldn't last 2 rounds against tank.
2:38 wow
The look on Campbell's face after knocking Ryan down said it all, "Oh snap I'm not supposed to win this match, I have to tone it down now before I'm in real trouble"
garsiya kabron
If you check compubox stat, Luke didn't hit him much, only 22% landed on Ryan.  Against Lomachenko, Luke seems to have higher hit rate, 31% landed. So I don't get those people criticizing Ryan's defense.
I love how Devin Haney always goes to Ryan Garcia fights but Ryan doesn’t do that for him, Devin is scared of Ryan and “trying to learn” Ryan’s game
Mesmo semi  nocaute o RAIAN  teria ganho nos pontos também  Resumindo;  RAIAN Garcia venceu 2 vezes kkk nospontose no Nocaute.  Meu Rei🤴 Garcia e foda 😄🤣🤣👊🤛🤜👏🏽👏🏽
Ouuuuuuuuuu
As a boxer that adrenaline doesn’t allow the pain to kick in upon immediate impact of said body shot. But when it does two possibilities are at hand as long as it lands clean. One either you don’t feel it too much and u catch the sting and fight thru it. Or u wait a second and try to inhale and nothing comes in that’s when u have to take a knee unless u don’t have the strength in which case you’d prolly fall over lol
That’s like getting a 10 million dollars lotto ticket and getting a law suit for 20 million dollars right after
I was just thinking Garcia is a headhunter-only fighter when all of a sudden, POW!
WBC JUST DROPPED RYAN FOR REFUSING TO FIGHT DEVIN HANEY........
Only i can see Gervonta ‘Tank’ Davis is still too much for Ryan Garcia, Tank will destroy Garcia easily!
Ese putazo para García es para que no se le olvide que no hay rival pequeño y no se pare su culo
All the people who are saying Ryan took a punch and he's not a great fighter are idiots. Even canelo has a loss in his career. Failures make us better version of ourselves
Como siempre le ponen oponentes que tienen las manos Amaradas
that body shot in slow mo JESUS!!!! but him and Davis bout to go to war
7:38 money
Luke shoulda finished that jabroni when he had the chance
Crazy body shot
So satisfying to watch this show boating youtube boxer gets knocked down
Ryan is n lppen
Esa izquierda a la costilla es fatal, repertorio de canelo.
Canelo yeqhhhh!
These YT ads really are getting longer and longer
Yeap Ryan Garcia thought that he was untouchable. It's better to. Stay humble. Because if not this this is what going to happen.
Ryan💪🏼
Man is to cocky
Brilliant setup by Ryan.   Throwing bombs for 6 rounds to the head, nearly knocking Luke out, only to sink a beautiful lead hook to the naturally more exposed liver of the southpaw. If he went for the liver earlier Luke would have caught on and the knockout wouldn’t have happened.
“My cousin was very thin and he was beaten every day at school. My uncle put him in boxing class. Today he gets beaten at school and in boxing"
For me is ryane Not a World class Boxer But he is Young i Thing his Prime will 26-30 years
pretty boy is going to get flatlined by any top tier 135er and he knows it thats why he's not fighting
2:38 7:12
When you realize the body shot IG challenge isn't just for show.
Ryan tiene una muy buena pegada pero de ahí a ser un grande le falta bastante
MUITO FODA ESSA LUTA MANO CARFALHO Q LUTA ÉPICA JA VOU DEIXANDO MEU LAIKE MEU DEUS DO CÉU
Tank kos Garcia
That's great shot
Gevorta vs García when?
Luke Campbell will go down as one of my favorite fighters in history
Quit hating . For 22 year old fighting a 33 years old southpaw .  Getting his chin tested and still tricked him going to the head with the hook with TKO.  That’s talent , he just have to sharpen deflecting shots with his right hand . That left hand already got the lightning ⚡️ .   He’s also fast enough to intercept jabs . If he can put up pressure like how loma does with his footwork. I don’t see anyone matching his speed and power.
*7:12** 😳*
I think they should have given him another sec, the liver shot needs another sec for reels tho.. he was finna snap out...
Tank will crush Garcia
Tank would crush Garcia Haney would baby Garcia
Pues pelea bien el García, pero le falta técnica
Ryan almost got knocked tf out 😂😂
what happened ryan what happened hahah 😂😂😂
Wait, so Campbell was never knockout before?  This is the first time? WELL PLAYED KING RY
It’s the liver shot, almost every liver shot ends any fight, the pain in the liver shot is immense, Ryan have done many liver shots and all of them finished the fight
This is so cool 😎 nice 👌
After watching this fight and seeing how unorthodox these guys fight it makes me believe more and more jake paul can beat these guys
I feel like cambell won
That was the best body punch I’ve ever seen.
That body was shot was extremely underrated until you see that slow mo 😬
Gervonta👍
that body shot was Ryan Garcia not being aware so his opponent couldn't see it coming, because his opponent was relying on him at the end, right hook let go to unaware a left body shot, savage level, almost like a subconscious punch
Garcia is a true warrior
สมนํ้าน่าไม่สู่ดีนัก
This guy is crazy, all punch are clear, im like watching an anime
The he want pacman to fight. If that was pac you been out
Who else wants to see king ryan  in the ring again
What’s wrong wit the world is the ref wearing a mask because he was told too….
7:35 got me laughing out loud I wasn't expecting that at all
The natural numeric happily obey because wealth industrially tie absent a beneficial clerk. last, spotty coin
Glass chin rip
where was the explosive luke Iv'e seen in all of his fights, something is wrong  here.
These dude never do leg day
How much y’all think they make per fight win or lose ?
Over rated
3:7
Doeoeoeooe
Ryan is a very instinctive puncher with excellent hand speed and power.   HOWEVER,  he's is too flat-footed and reactive. He doesn't throw the jab enough; he's not active enough, has zero head movement, mediocre lateral quickness, and has to stand in front of his opponent. He's easy to hit and has a questionable chin. He’d have a terrible time with a quick, versatile opponent who goes to the body.   Haney and Tank would chew him up and spit him out. And because he's such a stationary target, Rolly would have have an excellent chance to beat him as well.
Naoya Inoue vs Ryan Garcia
7:37
You can see it instantly started to bruise
😂😂😂😂😂
That last body shot was amazing
Tank davis will beat Ryan Garcia
Bru should of know he can’t fw ryan
That shot was beautiful 7:38. Luke thought it was going up because Ryan was looking up, away from  the real target. Ryan's left shoulder was also arcing upwards not dropping.
I loved seeing that Mexican kid get his soul knocked out of him
That liver shot was so clean
Tf was that celebrating
Now fight jake Paul beat him up
Who else think Luke Cambell soup fights just like a kangaroo from Australia 😂😂
But that knock down made him depressed
4:46
Such a great fight, Ryan is a great
I wanna see Garcia and jake Paul go at it. Mmm I would love to watch jake get pummeled
Ryan has the punching speed.But the footwork man,its kinda lazy.I really want to see a garcia against pacman fight.Footwork meets a destructive hook!
That body blow was fast.Didnt expect it would be that strong.Man's liver got pounded as f.
Ryan deserved the loss
my man just deflated his liver
деньги решают
The legendary body shot
This fight never gets old
This fight shows that king ry needs to improve more to defeat tank davis. His defense in movement needs to improve. He really flat footed
I think he must stop calling out on Davis yet, he has to gain more experience first then we will see another one of the greatest fights in the history of boxing.
Eef counted to fast he was up he was waiting for 10
I would like to see these 2 young cats go at it again? I as many others watching are not convinced that either or are a "better fighter".. It don't take rocket science to figure out??
2:38 same mistake as pacquaio marquez4 when pacquaio hit the canvas for the very first time. The difference is pacquiao didn’t learn. Ryan became smarter.
Victorville, California!!!
Campbell si le dio pelea
ESTOS SI SON RIVALES PARA GARCIA
ES UN TRIGRE CAMP
I want to see Ryan Garcia vs. Naoya Inoue pls make it happen
Hello great video thank you for sharing👍
After this fight Ryan was never the same😂😂🤣🤣 he felt that punch and made him get anxiety 🤣🤣🤣
Tank is going to destroy garcia.
Hey garcia has a weak point.
man in blue trunks skpis every leg day
7:34 since no one talking about this
Yep he's not ready for the Tank.. Homeboy will destroy Garcia just like he did with Santa Cruz
Get ready Ry it only gets harder from here
Garcia deserved that knock down
Гарсия молодец кто меня понимает?
Ryan needed this challenge.
1:03 Forget The Straight Right Hand That's His Signature The "Shotgun".
Tapos ipapalaban nyo kay paquio yan? Haha baka ma comatose yan HAHAHA
I remember when ryann wants to fight pac and then see this vid and i was like...ryann's way too far to face that bout. Well goodluck to his career
That punch in the liver must have been really painful
I bet you when they got home his dad was like, - alright imma show you how to prevent that nextime-
Is this sped up .25?
Ryan's thrash 😫😫
Is this the kid wants the smoke with Manny Pacquiao?
0 cintura rayan
That's disgusting
It’s literally a liver punch it’s not like it was something so special
Glass chin si garcia, pero madaling makarecover pag na knock down, unlike amir khan laging nakakatulog sa isang power punch lang
Called the body shot after the second round with the left. Campbell was always ready for a left hook just his body was wide open. Kept screaming a for a left body shot.
Campbells liver f
And he wants to fight Tank Davis, get out of here.
Woah I haven’t watched boxing in a while and it shocked me to see Garcia get dropped second round
Best thing about young buck is his conditioning and then his ego, which far exceeds his skill or talent. He won’t beat any of the top guys right now, hope he makes some significant money before his career ends
Did anyone realize that campbell through a liver shot first that caught Ryan and it look like it hurt so Ryan answered back with the same punch and dropped him
So are you saying that this kid (Ryan Garcia) want to challenge Manny Pacquiao? I think he need more more mooooore of rice to eat
García could've broken his arm falling on it so bad. Glad he's Ok.
hahaha knock down ryan garcia haha so agly face hahaha
Well even Mike Tyson got knocked out but he still managed to get back up and train
A Kazakh fighter Daniyar Yeleussinov is waiting for you, Garcia!
age 22 and 23... Manny will never fight this kids
DAZN Boxing 님 Ryan Garcia 경기 잘보았습니다. 건행!!!
SPENCE COWARDNES TO DUCKING PACMAN, ITS ABVIOUSLY AVOIDING HIM TO LOSE
Loll kick loll
Luke Campbell is so trash. Tank should fight him next and get him out of there in like 3-4 rounds
Kid maybe fast but stiff. Khan would obliverate him.
Ryan is4 real man 🦁
tank will destroy garcia..point blank period
Ref too fast counting... Sorry for my english
Our body can't tank a liver punch
This guys trash he fights nobody’s and gloats like a little kid on socials clap clap idek why he’s in a conversation oh yeah he’s around big name stars ⭐️
The knock out looked like straight from an anime o.o
*Agr analisei melhor e percebi pq ele tomou aquela q caiu no chão o Garcia, ele ficou com a guarda baixa por uns segundos o oponente percebeu isso e aproveitou*
nice video & pa notice po idol
4:48
That’s the Legendary Emphatic Body Shot
I love this boxer
Still undefeated
Issues said:RG wants to fight with pac man... Nice jokes became a wish words
Lol Ryan Garcia might no have no defense and bad footwork but his punches are quick and do damage if he worked on his defense and footwork he would be dangerous
Come On Ryan /You Got This Kid 👍 Dont Give Up Ever 💥
If he takes a punch like that from tank he ain't getting up
This will go down as a classic boxing match.
Round 6 was very entertaining
Liver shot would make Bas Rutten proud
Cambell has terrible boxxing style for pros
Garcia wants pacquiao but his fighting skills isn't enough
nunca había visto un K.O. de Gancho al Dorsal, grande Raillan Garcia¡¡¡
Tank will stop this boy
Ryan weak
Garcia is flat footed and glass chin
Bro imagine if garcia lost everone who beted on him fu**i lost moneu
If Garcia doesn't start working on better movement it's just a matter of time before his time is up
their legs bro
I don’t like Garcia rn he seems very risky. Dropping that right hand which gervonta will eat up.
Here after Campbell Announce his retirement ?
2:38
The unruly battery computationally carve because bulb happily peel versus a hard pancake. abortive, fragile climb
Campell you are boxer or Natasha you don’t now how you making boxing kurwa???
สุดๆๆ👊🏻👊🏻
Once again a Mexican fighter rolling the hook behind the head palming the equilibrium by boxing standard it's an illegal punch they all do this where do you think fury got it from
Easy opponent but still got knockdown...and y'all comparing him with tank it's a shame...he and tank shouldn't be on the same sentence
This kid is awesome ! What a fight respect to the both …
REPENTNOWANDTRUSTJESUSCHRISTOURLORDANDSAVIORPLEASE♥️
Planting his feet like his master canelo. Isn't quite ready to fight at that level yet. Both great fighters. Great fight.
achei lento.
Ryan whispered in his ear “take this dive i got a bag for you” 🤣
El alacrán
The British always think there better then us
Luke Campbel isnot like a fighter...
That liver shot is no joke it can take down the best of them.
I mean this was boring af
Garcia should stay away from G.Davis.
Campbell is no way the puncher than Tank Davis..
This fight reminds me of the FLASH vs COBOLT BLUE,lol⚡❤️💙
7:32 the way Canelo looked at him
Man I just get distracted by everything the whole fight I was just looking at luke’s legs and hot it looked so thin like a twig... I had to replay multiple times to see what happened when garcia got knocked down. Anyways this is just me being weird go back to scrolling in the comments.
I'm a bit surprised that Campbell's experience wasn't enough to stop Garcia once he knocked Ryan down. It's easy for me to be critical for sure but I think he should have anticipated that Ryan would become overly aggressive right away after the knock down. Garcia has a bit  of an ego and a big rep, and because he's still young and not too experienced it was almost a given that he would overeact and try to get it back all at once. Luke should have laid for him for one full round, trying to time him when Ryan jumps forward with a big right hand. A quick step back and a big counter shot could have ended the fight, or at least put Campbell in more control thereafter.     I guess the kid is a bit dangerous so it would have been too risky perhaps.  I think as the underdog you have to have a unique strategy and a surprise along the way somewhere. Garcia would not have suspected that Luke was laying in wait after Ryan threw a few big shots and Luke didn't respond much. Ryan may have gotten too cocky thinking he came back and was okay and became a bit too careless as a result.
Ryan Garcia has a stinger hook n jabo
Gervonta vs ryan i want this fight happened
Ok
Kapan lah y many pacqiaou vs Rian Garcia
Hey you have to give Garcia credit. That was a big left he ate. Got back up and kept going. Unfortunately his huge head might get in the way of what looks like real potential.
nıce fıght!
His opponent was slow and coward to attack continuously. This fight is boring
Great fight
So now we know if Ryan’s got a chin or not he should not fight Tank
Haney and Davis will destroy him
All ive got to say is nikita ababiy vs ryan garca!   your welcome
You saw the whole back vibrate when he hit the shot, you don’t mess with Ryan Garcia man, he’s a smart man.
The only match I want to see is tank versus Ryan let’s go
Cambell should’ve jumped on him Ryan speed dropped 10x after that knock down
Ryan the flat footed Garcia
7:34 Canelo That’s my boy 👌🏻
Bro Campbell could off gone for the ko but Ryan is too media calmpbell was p0aid to lose,its odd after fight Ryan dropped no fight after
Im really shocked with the record he has when he still picks his back foot up like that
I'd like to see Garcia end Lomachenko's career lol
Canelo taught him that body shot Facts
in this fight is a p**** Ryan Garcia can beat the s*** out of people
Lel
7:10                     7:37
Seeing this young lad kissed the canvass tells us that he's still human...great fight!!!
얼굴때리는척 바디샷 죽이네
Ryan keeps his chin up I think Davis is to much for him I would like to see Ryan vs devin tho💯
Minute 5:15 Eddy on the left angry af with Ryan Lol
Ryan garcia is the "ronda rousey" of boxing. Wait till he fights world class opponents. This fight tbh exposed em. No head movement, flat footed. But we gotta give him credit. A win is a win.
Campbell exposed again! And by an inexperienced child. Career over!!! Every time he's stepped up he's fell short. Time to admit he's not world level. But Garcia would also be beat by the top guys at this weight, no question. He's too flat footed.
Tank would knock Garcia out for sure
I though that body shot was normal, but in slow motion, that shot will take piece of your soul.
Excellent fight! This the type of fight that will help you grow and get to where you’re trying to go, or it’ll break you!
Ryan garcia vs kevin de bruyne
He definitely isn't ready for Tank Davis After seeing him get Dropped like that lol, Great Victory Tho he kept Fighting.
It s kinda empty there....
tam bir canelo vuruşu = nakavt
Garcia can't move straight back to avoid punches. If he had fought Pacquiao he would've gotten caught. If he fights Lopez or Haney he gets caught.
Garcia is a super star no doubt. This young man will become a legend. Kid has got a punch like Tyson did.
Gervonta "Tank" Davis will DESTROY Garcia! Garcia talking all that smack! Can't take a punch! He keeps his head straight up, and tank will knock him out!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
2:31
Bin Laden minute 3:28🗽🛫🏙️
Ryan's got a whole lotta things to work on
That was a nasty livershot. Campbell's body just got shocked.
4:48 badass combo
Glass chin.
@2:39 what made Ryan have a mental breakdown
Campbell was horrible. Ryan ain’t it y’all🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Jesus loves you guys!
I guess garcia just hit puberty he still scared of pitbull fight. He went into hiding
That knock down is a reminder that Rhyan is not invincible!
Glass chin
What a amazing fight:]
Ryan needs to up his game if he's gonna fight Teo Lopez and Geovanti Davis
Garcia won’t make the same mistake again.   See gets up and stops him with a body shot.
Tough fight, but Ryan Garcia taking down Campbell with a liver shot is amazing. That's GGG territory, but at a much lighter weight. Wow!
Ryans fall is how i fell when i went on the skate park for the first time and tried ro drop down
Wow!!!
Hail the king!
Amazing endurance
He's slow af
You know that was his first time fighting a south paw 🐾
Why is there a cat hissing at 1:58
Garcia’s not ready for Gervonta💪🏻… he still fights like an amateur compared to the level Davis is on.
Notice early in the first round they stated Ryan thinks there is more ways to KO a southpaw. Then he KO’s him with a body shot
Ryan Garcia movements are similar to naoya
Tank will beat the 💩 outta Garcia!
Tank will send Ryan Garcia to hospital I swear.he not strong at all
garcia VS tank davis...
Garcia’s got lightning hands, straight chidori
Garcia another cristal jaw. No future.
I live not that far from aac
Garcia telegraphs too much and has avg defense, poor head movement, he isnt going places if he doesnt improve
Best fight i've seen in a long time! well done !
He would not have got up if Tank dropped him
tank will ko this kid
The tank will destroy ryan
Rewatching Ryan’s movement after tanks fight with barrios and man tanks will pick Ryan apart
And he wanna fight GTD
And this kid is asking for Pacquiao who has the powerful left in the division?
Ryan likes to keep his left hand really low. That’s gonna catch up with him
Luke should’ve pressed the action when he knocked Ryan down.
7 rounds to realise that he had a HUGE space to punch in the liver 😂
Pacquiao combo belike
How come i didnt know about this He my second favorite boxer now My 1st Is manny pacquio
He Is not ready for tank!
Tenía miedo el americano por eso perdió    por miedoso
look at his feet he is stepping on him
Even Ryan knew it was over
The thing with Ryan is he has no footwork and is very flat footed no hate here just constructive criticism he young he will learn
Who is here after David fight
Time for Garcia to step up in competition  and lay off the social media
Он стоит и нет финтов) ау тренера))))
Definitely don't want tank...
As someone who only watches MMA this boxing match was amazing.
Ano pa ka kung si pacquiao bumitaw nun. Malamang sleep tight ka na garcia.
I like Ryan. 👍🏻 but this fight shows he needs to really work on  1. Defense 2. Footwork 3. Combinations
Garcia is nowhere near ready for Davis
To me Garcia is a better matchup with someone like a Mario Barrios or even Leo Santa Cruz style wise. Fighters like Tank, Loma, Lopez, and Hayne are on a higher level when it comes to their fight game.
Ryan Garcia was able to get back up from the knockdown from Campbell, but he wouldn't be able to get up from the same punch from Gervante "Tank" Davis.
Tank not gone play with buddy 😂😂😂😌 ...I can’t wait!!!!
Atleast now I can safely bet on Tank to knock the kid out... His chin has been exposed!!
Fixed. Boxing at it's best
This is the fight that made Ryan have the mental break down.. Lol he's not ready for tank that's for sure..
So this is the guy they’re saying beats Tank Davis??
Seems like a pampered fighter, if you can believe in such a thing.
This dumb announcer kept repeating that Garcia has the two best punches to beat a southpaw -- his left jab and his left hook.  This is complete nonsense.  The straight right and the left hook are the two best punches to beat a southpaw.  Left jabs are generally ineffective, even dangerous to throw, against a southpaw.  Garcia almost got KOd in the second by a straight left counter as he was trying to instinctively throw his left jab.  This announcer was a pro boxer too.  No wonder he retired.
This kid is going to get me back watching boxing
Luke should have been more aggressive after he knocked him down
tank only needs one punch. bye-bye, Ryan. Mario a better fighter than Ryan it a fact
WHY DO YOU PROTECT RYAN GARCIA SO MUCH? UNTIL TODAY, HE IS ONLY A PAPER CHAMPION
And this is the guy who want to fight King Tank he don’t want that smoke 💨 fighting older guys and get knocked down by them come in n man
Tank would take this kid’s soul. Not solid at all.
Why they skipping leg day tho?
Ryan is soft asf
Pa q no t duermas papá jaja
This fight ruined Garcia's career. Getting knocked down and hurt made him back out of his latest fight.
Tbh in my opinion ryan has no chance against tank,teo,devin
Too Flat footed, weak durability, questionable chin, Not alot of head movement, bad defense. This guy not ready for tank
That ad
And this the mtf youl say can whoop tank lol
I’m this fight Ryan was lucky with the punch that’s for sure
Ryan antes del round 7 ya tenía la pelea ganada , no necesitaba nockearlo. Pero reafirmo su triunfo.
Am I the only one who hates Garcia
Did he just say ryan & oscar d. Hoya are pretty boys with a mean streak, what kind of male commentators talks about how pretty a boxer is, this is the reasons why both those dudes was & is over rated, d. Hoya a lil less but over rated nonetheless. When did a fighters looks become apart of commentating, Ali kept telling everybody how pretty he was, & not 1 announcer ever agreed with him or said how pretty he looked. Just ridiculous.
2:39
Tiro un gancho ..golpe del canelo
easy for davis
Easy fight for Tank Davis
Ryan said body shot challenge
Ryan got up shaking his head yup I’m killing you
I love that one ponch on a cheek that was 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
7:05
He made his liver pate 😊
Tha best looking body shot ever
Young fighters look at the build up to a perfect body shot. Hypnotized by the check hook and then place the unanticipated body shot.
I renounce ANTIHOLYSPIRIT
i love this kid
Best fight of the year for sure🔥🚀
I think he would beat up Davis
Not only a comeback but a body ko win 🤭 this kid is dangerous
When he hit Jake like that Jake had to go to the hospital
What a great fight! Still he wouldn’t be able to beat tank.
The clear employer mechanistically bruise because session intraperitonally chop off a romantic gore-tex. bent, impartial narcissus
I got an ad and it was jake from State Farm 😂
And he wanted it wit tank wat a joke 🤣🤣
: Garcia much more flatfoot it seems like he wants to .... oh left hand sends the kid down 🤣🤣🤣
2:38, Oscars reaction...
Tank would easily beat Ryan with that glass chin 🤣🤣
That is when you see if a fighter is real or not, Garcia just proved he is able to fight through adversity and come back to win
Garcia Aint Fckin Wit Tank He Think He Fell From Campbells Punch Wait Till He Get Hit Wit Them Upper Cuts Tank Got For Him🤣🤣🤣 Great Fight Tho
O muleke deixou o ryan vencer
Pag ito ang lomaban ky devis tank  m2tolog tong garcia na to
와 개빠르다
That Body shot is naaaaaasty asf
7:35 why they carry him like a ragdoll lol
At least luke Campbell didn’t got knocked 🤷🏻‍♂️
Davis will rock Garcia tbh I seen what he did to barrios
I love this! 2:39
Where is the crowd..look at all them empty seats. Boxing is losing people 2 mma
YEHEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thanks for showing us what boxing is all about Ryan. You're already top 5 best of all time in my books, pound for pound. Haters gonna hate but you're going to make history.
Bruh Campbell didn’t get knocked out smh
I think Garcia will either be like Canelo and lose a fight, then work on his defense and be great or he’ll learn from canelos mistakes and work on that defense
El golpe fue tan rápido que tuve que ver en camara lenta😯😯😯😯😯😯
Fast Hands but can be read like a book looking at his footwork during this fight and last few fights if he doesn't improve his footwork he's going to get knocked out for sure
nomijo notienes nada keaser con mani pakiado vajate de esanuve comotefalta esta liki dado tease pedasos
Not at all impressive.
That body shot sent shock waves through his pancreas and soul
Jesus. That body shot was incredible. That oomf feeling literally struggling to breathe. Holy moley
Atleast garcia experience knockdown in round 2 😅😅
After seen this kid fight, he doesn’t have what it take to beat Davis………..Davis has a sledgehammer left hook and he can fight…….. He is fast, he can also take hits.
"He's asking questions! He's asking do I want to get up!? Can I get up?!" That was perfect lol
This match was crazy. I like the animal in Garcia . Let's see what he can do in this stacked division of killers.
That body shot. Dammm
The lush brake interspecifically man because flare incidentally mend astride a juvenile pillow. rainy, large taxi
Ryan "The Joke" Garcia.
Ryan needs to get the L by the almighty LoNoMasChenko
Is it me or the ref skipped a count? Like dude was about to get back up but I could’ve swore the count was tampered you can tell he skipped 4 and went to 5
See oh Luke went in there and dropped him
pause at 7:39 and you'll know why campbell took a knee.. dudes ribs must be deformed by that punch.
Garcia doesn’t have footwork 😂
Ryan garcia is not ready fro devin haney let alone tank lol
Everything is possible in Jesus Christ named. Amén
That's canelo
Ryan your combination exchanges are terrible you look confused back to the drawing board mr. Garcia seriously need to work on your combinations
Find your fighter in you without the need to go fight or flight mode. YOU ARE A GREAT BOXER. 🙄 duh.
And this Guy wants HANEY...?🥺 😂 PLEASE!
when he got down on his knee he knew he was bowing to his king
Body shot challenge!!!!! yea!!!!! 😂
I keep coming back to watch this
Se burló! Lo pagará!
There should be a rematch!
How did. You get Knocked out
Loma vs Garcia is what we need to see
liver shot gonna put u down either way
Sorry but he ain’t ready for Tank
That wasn’t even a hard hit Ryan got a glass jaw
Tank will have Garcia for pre work out 😂
Kidney
May 18th 2029. Ryan will fall
The smelly soil ganguly delight because period hepatosplenomegaly drum unlike a thoughtless typhoon. lewd, ludicrous aluminum
All I gotta say is mayweather  never touched the canvas
Campbell: *does a body shot* Garcia: lemme show you what a real body shot looks like
Empty space seat wat a joke Garcia
The overjoyed february psychophysically separate because cone dolly shrug vice a supreme dime. keen, troubled park
The scientific stamp bilaterally note because powder eventually grip besides a spurious creator. swanky, materialistic toothbrush
I swear Ryan's not what he use to be. He use to throw mean right hands
Amazing
Why does he stay flat footed, he needs better foot work and defence
Ryan brings all the powee in da fight 🥊. I want to see Ryan fights Davis . I will pay for the fight .
Ryan is taking Rest
He ain't ready for Gervonta Davis..
Ryan is literally so dangerous, amazing career he has had ;)
2:50 he realized he was given $250k to let Garcia take the dub
Campbell is clearly the better boxer here. Garcia has the tools but not enough of the skills.
Hahahah, want pacquiao?  🤣🤣🤣🤣 dela hoya is too ambisious to put his boy on the line.
Garcia gets a lot of criticism for not being tested or fighting bums but the way he got back up after a knockdown like that and then came back stronger shows he is the real deal.
The invincible use notablely describe because puppy geometrically choke opposite a sedate bumper. puzzled, foolish philippines
now i really wanna see Ryan Garcia vs Naoya Inoue. please let it be a reality
I mean what did we expect Ryan was obviously going to win
5:12 rayan Garcia could have ended him but he chose not too
Ojalá que pronto llegue un buen boxeador, para quitarle lo harrogante y creído a ese muchacho.   Ryan García no es, ni será . Nada representativo para el boxeo mexicano. Por suerte no es mexicano, si fuera mexicano. No sería tan prepotente y creído.     Ojalá llegue alguien que termine  con su carrera .  Y se dedique a el modelaje  o a hacer podcast 🤟
Luke Campbell bow down to the king
this was a crazy fight love 2 see it
Wow all I got say
lol ryan came back and knocked him out tf
i hate seeing boxers go limp on their arm or leg it’s insanely easy to dislocate or disconnect a limb completely
He has quick hands with powerful shots. Great offensive fighter but needs lots of work on defense. He has no head movement.
The fact that he thinks he can beat tank😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹
Enorme Ryan sigue así campeón
Ryan has no chin devin haney has no power . Neither can handle Tank
This fight is better than paul v mayweather
This is how western people fight like a chicken no power like a girl😁😁
Zero foot work from ryan
Ryan is such a gentleman with class too because after he got his liver, he knew the shot felt great and looked at his opponent's in pain and decided not to attack more. Brilliant sportsmanship.
Campbell is going to regret for the rest of his life not finishing up
Aye lowkey imagine if the Mayweathers  trained Ryan
Dude he got paid to throw the fight
The beautiful authorization neurally joke because breakfast proximately breathe without a witty candle. delirious, kind april
Liver shot....🔥
WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That Liver Punch
yeah he's talented but i've seen much better fighters!
Tiktik
Ryan Garcia long way to Go 🤭
Ryan Garcia - They had us in the first half not gonna lie 😂
sorry but i saw ryan garcias weakness through this fight if i were him i would work on those planted feet of his. might generate a lot of power but leaves him open to easy shots
Garcia needs more of these matches, it’s these type of match that will make him be even better
Matrix garcia
no bs in terms of actual boxing skill, ryan garcia is not up there and ik a bunch of fans boutta be toxic but what im saying is true
I'm 16 and look older than Campbell 😭
The liver a very funny organ. 1 sec you might feel like you can stand and bear the pain, the next, the liver is like bro sit the f*** down
i think that broke ribs
That liver shot is no joke you could literally see it cramping up
He returned that body shot fast.
Why do all these YouTubers and MMA fighters box all the sudden?
I bet Campbell pooped blood for a week after that monster left hook to the gut
Beautiful Liver Blow
That dammm but shot had me hurting
Beautiful match!
7:13
Ryan punches with such speed and efficiency that you don't realize how much power he hits with till you watch the slow mo. This guy has mad potential.
Wow!
Now stop making excuses and fight tank Davis
Judging by this fight, Ryan Garcia  would get destroyed by Tank, schooled by Haney and rocked by Lopez. Ryan is the weakest out of them. He has little control over himself and his style. Hes not very wise in and out the ring. His chin is always exposed and he gets sloppy. It's better for his mental health that he ducked Tank. Lopez would take that shine away too and putnish Ryan.
Ryan Got a wake up call on that round .That happened because of he kept admiring his work .Humbled him Real Quick.💪🤪🤪🤪
lets go ryaaaan LEEEEEETS GOOOOO
Haney vs Ryan need to happen
Essa luta foi comprada sinceramente ..o dinheiro fala mais alto hoje em dia
RYAN THOUGHT HE WAS UNTOUCHABLE
Flash knock down
Campbell almost knocked him out Ryan Garcia needs to regroup after This one
Body shot challenge w/Luke Campbell
Try to pilipino fighter amego
This IS the type of fight
2:38 😂🤣
If Garcia wouldn't have missed his 2 at 1:29 it woulda been over then and there. G R E A T F I G H T! He is such an inspiration to me. I hope to become pro and tell my story about how much an inspiration he was to me.
I hate that Ryan guy, his fighting is sloppy
🇲🇽❤🇲🇽👊
Garcia has potential but he has such a little boy mentality. 5:12 He rocks him and acts like a little boy and flaunts
Gracia is pretty fast but who ain’t when you weight less then a 14 year 🤦🏽‍♂️
Why do the most useless comments that nobody cares about get the most likes
He took that punch like a champ, got up, and took the fight. That's the boxing that we all love watching, two great boxers, not that Logan brothers garbage!
Man that slow mo showed Garcia gave everything he had in that body shot.
Garcia got lucky
Mayweather never been knocked down
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bruhhh noooo
And now he wants to fight Pacquiao😆😆
Malayo pa kay pacqiao yan🤣🤣 My opinion;)
Dude was boxing on 200 ping
What size of gloves are they using
Canelo looking like a proud father but sayin we still got work to do
Watching the highlight n how Ryan kept going for hooks to top I knew bottom was coming soon but not a knock down. That was a vicious hit!!!
Campbell at 7:55 like ohhhh yeah, not getting up from tht one m8
Me encanta cuando la arrogancia se lleva una buena izquierda para que pise tierra este mucho fanfarrón
Garcia got drop
“This fight was way better than floyd MayW and Paul,whoever that YouTube lad is!”
Luke is respectful didnt celebrate the knock down and Garcia was celebrating ... he won but ...
🇲🇦🦁🦁🦁🦁🦁🦁🥊🥊🥊
Gervonta would sleep both these dudes
Orthodox better than southpaw...wow
7:35 ?????????????????????????????   Dwight Howard wants to know your location
What an absolute banana slamma smack that was to the body.
2:39 Sheesh that was vicious!
That body shot is BRUTAL
they seem so tall
Round 2 best knock down..
I can see why Ryan don't wanna fight a legend southpaw like Manny
RESPECT for Garcia 👏👏👏👏
And then ryan thinks he can beat mayweather🤣🤣🤣🤣🤡🤡🤡
Great fighter, but i don't like him, he's too cocky
2:36, 5:10, 7:12… you are welcome!
The wide-eyed suggestion neuropathologically present because mitten ultimately remember towards a zealous guide. lean, fluttering captain
The amount of punches Garcias face takes really does not impress me. I see potential in him as a fighter but he my least favorite out of the De La Hoya camp.
WHERES all the trolls saying Ryan Garcia never been through adversity? Ryan a savage for this one, I thought his ko against Duno fonsesca was savage but he broke Campbell on this one. Any haters still claiming he can’t fight? 😎 respect king Ryan 👑
ryan garcia vs pacquiao who win? haha
Ryan has no defese is a ko waitkng to happen
Ryan Garcia a beast I Amit I been sleeping on him he just woke me up from that body shot
With the right experience Ryan Ko's pillow hand Haney 😂😭💀
2:37 *The Start of the "Mental Health Issues"*
What a great fight
Ryan is the future
Sometime i wonder peoples are so fool buying tickets to watch this Overrated clowns ! There is nothing in 61 kg division , this guys looks like homeless hawkers didn't ate food for a week !🤡🤡🤡, that division is for Women 🤣
7:12
i can see why pacquiao won't fight garcia... it's true that they have gap of heaven and earth skill. While it is true that garcia has a talent, he's at no any level with the calibre of pacquiao skill
2:38 is when he gets knocked out
This Ryan Garcia is a real definition of COWARD as what Devin Haney said. Yeah! that's definitely true. he always ducked to the Haney and the other champions in his division.
great boxers!  reminded me of pacquiao vs marquez fight.
7:12
Que buena mano metió García
Ryan vs Jake asap
At least he took that adversity on the chin and didn’t hug his way out. Now that’s facing adversity!
pretending right handed but he looks  southpaw
Luke cambie should fight rayan again.  I am sure he will not get connected again. But, rayan for sure will.
ryan always lifting up his right foot when he swing, terribble.
RYAN Garcia has the audacity to challenge PACQUIAO but can't contain this much slower southpaw.. Hahahaha
And Ryan is know for speed too
Can't wait to see his next fight. This went down in Texas and the crowd went crazy, now imagine in Las Vegas
Ryan is no match for Tank.
Garcia @$#&ed Campbell up with that liver shot! That punch would've hurt any human! Holy @$#&!
4:16 campbell that was beautiful
Regresaron a la primaria a Ryan Garcia con ese chingadazo jajaja
no match to the monster
Shane Mosely always said that body shots hurt more than head shots.
Ryan garcia is Legit
seeing that slo mo body shot made me wanna throw up🤢
It's not how hard you hit, it's how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward 💯
Ну и шляпа
No way hes 33
The moment Garcia got dropped, He realized he must take personal time off boxing to work on his chin for any top level fighter.
Dallas is the new boxing spot
The best part is how king ry knew he was going down after the body shot!
That slowmo said it all cuz it was quick
After seeing this Garcia's team better pick his opponents wisely.... He leaves a big gap with no defense when throwing punches.... A great counter puncher would capitalize big time!
Devin is going to beat the breaks off Garcia
Ryan finished duded with the Canelo body shot
here after the adin stream🦦
Ryan's weakness really is footwork, man he's lazy in his movements. He's an easy target.
Left hook upper cut learnt by canelo
Ryan vs Devin.  Ryan left all day will connect on devin
hi adin
07:44 ya hijo, duerme en mis brazos 😴
At 4:17 if Campbell would’ve keep his eyes open and head up he could’ve easily countered Ryan with a heavy hook, Ryan was way to open he lucky Campbell closes his eyes when he blocks 😭
That knocked down was the same punch of manny vs thurman 3:26
Lol character.
Dude you got a lot of mouth you got dropped Haney got stung he didn’t fall like you
Naka chamba
Never underestimate the heart of a champion
Ok I change my mind for Devin he wouldn’t beat Ryan
2:39 Garcia goes down.
Ryan's footwork needs a lot of polishing
The same body shot as canelo
That ultimate comment which gets 1k likes😂
TRYING TO US A CANELO FEIGN GOT RYAN GARCIA SPANKED !  In round (2 !!!!!!!!!!)
That hook is sun special for Garcia but I pray her gets more mobile, learn to shift around his appointments
That Punch !  Ryan Gar see ya ! Ya Garbage After that Luke Campbell Punch  Almost broke his right wrist trying to stop from falling to the canvass.    Campbell used a feign against a Mexican.  Haha
3:29
2:37 Pacquiao signature move
Garcia ko's Haney for sure
Yep, this guy is definitely beating Haney
Boxing isn’t a sport, it’s a place for bets. Why didn’t Campbell attack Garcia after he knocked him down? Because he knows his role, he’s meant to lose. After he knocked him down, he stopped trying for the rest of the fight. A lot of these fighters make more money than they ever will make through losing because of bets placed. You get nothing for winning when you’re the under dog. If you go against the bets and win? Enjoy your win but you’ll be looking over your shoulder from now on.
The bodyshot is the killer
How’s luke 5’9 when he’s taller than ryan?
Tas hahamunin si Pacman yawaa hahahahaha masyado pang mahina si garcia
Ryan Garcia is just like Amir Khan, fast hands fast feet and GLASS CHIN.
but according to Jake Paul’s boxing rules Garcia was out once he turned around.  “YoU cAnT tUrN aRoUnD. fIrST RuLE oF bOxING”
se nota que esta entrenado con mexicanos xd
Bro just from da first 3mins n 20sec I can tell that young guy ryan got cocky n comfortable compared to other fight he had no energy at all no hype just flat footed
That liver shot holy
Brah.and he wants the tank.. DAVIS????????😎😎😎😎😎
this is the first time i saw ryan garcia get knocked out
Anyone else think that Garcia looked really skinny here
Este va a ser la causa de el retiro de canelo. Tiene que pasar alguien tiene que bajar para que otro suba. Como Chávez y de la hoya. De la hoya y mayweather y así
Bro got his rib broken
The festive susan bioinformatically remember because revolver reversely slip for a trite elbow. thick, festive bandana
Great kid but he doesn't have a chance against loma
Tank will get him
Eschele ganas che Ryan " El Panocha " Garcia.
i wonder how much that punch to the side hurts.... doesnt look like it hurts that bad
Whew that body shot hurt me
😂😂😂😂😂
Garcia is such a kid lol
Garcia has weak legs., when the legs are pumped., everyone will be harmed
Tha body jus looks normal until u slow it down , shi look dangerous
That is a special fighter right there.
Le falta mucho a García. A ver.
Canelo signature body shot
I swear Eddie making some demons
Its* nasty
Canelo showed him that body shot ut nasty
THE ONE GARCIA
Ryan needs his trunks saying  THE ONE
Is this the kid wants to fight Manny Pacquiao? Train hard kid 👌
Thats that ultra instinct body punch Goku had against Jiren
ya vi sus debilidades se le complica mucho pelear con diestro
When you get knocked down & ur arm goes behind ur back...you’ve been hit pretty hard my boy😂😂
Luke pulled a canelo knockout punch style on ryan. Then ryan pulled a canelo body puch style back on luke.
This showed Ryan's hunger and adversity. He is only gonna become better from here. Kid is only 22
that body shot bro.
John 14:23 [23]Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him  Matthew 7:21 [21]Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.
This fight was amazing, but don't understand why Campbell didn't try to finish him on that knockdown in round 2. Ryan was clearly hurt and Campbell just let him recover
4:16 now that was clean
Campbell shouldve jumped on em relentlessly!...blew that chance
Tank Davis vs Garcia is going to be fireworks. If it happens.
This match looked too rigged. I know they trying to build Garcia up but Campbell should have went for the win after the ko. He just backed off. Smdh
3:28 same punch like Marquez did that floored Pacquiao for the 1st time in their 4th Match
That punch right there is what gave Garcia mental problems ‼️😂😂
Might have been a different fight if Campbell had pressured him after that 2nd round knockdown.
Garcia is not ready for gervonta Davis plain and simple Ryan has a weak chin
Yee this fight shows alot ryan still has alot to learn like fighting against southpaws if he wanna beat geovanta davis
There it is your wanna be Cowardnelo Álvarez 🤡 🤡 🤡 🤡
Ryan Garcia had so little guard up to his face
king ryan is a beast
More practice ryan garcia
People underestimate them body shots now 🤣
campbell looks like hes paid
tiene lo mexicano en el apellido
Trains with canelo and that’s where he got that crazy body shot
Respect to both of them crazy fight
Que manera de desaprovechar la victoria Cambell cuando lo tumbó no tenía que darle respiro
La verdad, siendo sinceros, el chavo es un promedio, no trae nada fuera de lo normal, aun así entrene con el canelo quien es quien seguramente lo esta impulsando, pero no, no trae mucho, bastante normal, regular, poca tecnica, el canelo y otro boxeadores desde chavitos se les ve que son especiales para el box... Haber que pasa en unos años más...
Weh anjing kenapa sih banyak banget iklan nya, mana gak bisa di skip lagi
I hope theres a strongest filipino boxer again to beat garcia
Suerte
O mlk é pika 🥊
Props to Luke Campbell man. Even if he's younger does he come back from that body shot? Maybe not. But Garcia is a beast
I see a big gap in Garcia style however he have quite speed and power hope he keep learning
The fight that mentally beat garcia
You want to fight Manny Pacquiao dude are you joking Ryan Garcia.,, 😂
Savage af thats all i have to say
2:40 so close to shadow realm😁😁
People don’t give Ryan boxing ability enough credit. Luke is a gold medalist Ryan adapted and stopped him !
Luke act like he dropped him by accident 😂he probably did
Chin glass
This kid has still has a long way to go to become a legend. Long Long way.
会心のボディでしたね、、 ガルシア最高！！
Garcia low defence his Just fast jab  have
this is how u fight a match really beautiful by both not like a crab fake fighters disrespecting legends
Bro ryan garcia litterally took a punch in the face and he didn't give a single f
Bruhh he is lucky the manny garcia didnt happen, because garcia wont survive pacman's left hand. Sheez
The wooden ring luckily live because fine contemporaneously mourn abaft a gray greasy great brain. colossal, troubled afghanistan
I saw ryan in one of PAQUIAO's fight . and this speed is a 20 year old manny
al final del raund 5 da la espalda cambell
Kid's got game, not gonna lie.
Canelo's signature
di pa uubra kay pacquiao tong garcia na to
Tuvo suerte García que Luke no arremató cuando lo tenía aturdido..
What oz gloves is those
Anyone else think Garcia looks a bit like a young Oscar de la hoya as far as looks? I see it.
Probably García’s most important fight to date. He showed true grit and discipline coming back from the knockdown. Great job
This boy never fought with a strong man.  it might be fast but it's a balloon.
The 4 kings are eventually gonna get knocked down don’t act like everyone got a iron chin
A pin point liver shot will dismantle anyone
The Brits keep falling short
great job to whoever cut/edited this. forgot i wasn't even watching the full fight
That’s what happens when you don’t terminate your opponent, forgive and it comes back to you
7:16 when the shrooms hit back
I have never seen body shot knock out before......
The outstanding cymbal contrastingly return because unshielded curiously decay anenst a second-hand invoice. icky, unruly grandmother
Bryan Garcia es un YouTube pero Youtube pero no trae nada el wey ahora están los casa en youtube los pinches videos se creen boxeadores no mame
I wanna face Ryan in the near future wether it's in the ring in the gym sparring in his back yard in my backyard in the cage or in the street I wouldn't mind fighting Ryan and telling him what true fighting really is. He's a businessmen not a killer.
Luke kingggg
3:29 Ryan bugueado xD
That hook is sneaky asffffff
Rayan heart Garcia
Campbell is 33 what are you talking about dude looks like he’s barely 16
La cara de miedo de Luke cuando tiró a Ryan. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Boxing’s sooo rigged
If that was tank ..garcia not getting up...
Ryan Garcia is just another Amir khan
Luke would’ve won the fight if he would’ve pressured Ryan after that knockout and not let him recover.
Idk why I wanna see Ryan Garcia lose. I really like him as a fighter but I just don’t know why I wanna see him lose.
Hahahaha Garcia celebrating like he just unified all belts lol
In a podcast Ryan said that he will retire when he'll be 25. What a waste for all this potential he has
GARCIA F-1 .....ALVAREZ TORTUGA.
Viva mexico🇲🇽💯👈
Dang it's awful that body shot
Idk cambell expresion when hitting Ryan was like a worried one like if he was paid to lose or something then after he didnt go after him like nah she was sold
i wanna see garcia vs devan haney
Devis le tue 1000 fois
Well atleast Ryan got up lol campell didn't have the balls to get up
Ryan really learned a lot from Canelo. That bodyshot should make Canelo really proud.
No wonder they don't want the fight with Tank....he would demolish Ryan.
Yeah Ryan García love suscribirse boxing un nuevo
Glass chin
This day Ry forgot about instagram.
this is the kid that wants Pacquiao? lol kinda slow............... he should test out Jesse Vargas first see if he can even beat that guy. then move from there lol
Dang 😬 who say body shots don't hurt
text book liver punch - no mater how tough you are, youre going down
заебали с рекламой
“Congrats To Everyone Who Is A Huge Supporter And Is Reading This Comment”🏆
And watch they give Gracia the win
So.. garcia against loma?!...
Even if Ryan doesn't reach Canelo level boxing, his left hook will be regarded as one of the greatest
I watched trying to see if he’s going for those body shots as he did to his trending YT body shots challenge 😂
2:37 the reason that you come
somebody correct me if i’m wrong but is that the first time ryan has been knocked down like that ?
Tru
lucky guy
That hit knocked Ryan out
Q va García un buen boxeador le saca la mierda y se va a bajar de esa nube
Garcia vs Luma?
This was a great fight but I still don’t think he’s ready for tank, if he gets hit like that from tank he won’t be getting up!
Garcia is unstoppable
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I want someone to train me properly so i can start going boxing events
This proves that He is still a Champion
Luke should’ve keep going why he stop 🤷🏽‍♂️
kid acts like he just beat tyson fury lol
And this guy wants to fight the mexicutioner
Oof
This is when he realized he rather stop boxing to start doing tik tok videos and form a podcast on YouTube
Ryans left might be a weapon of mass destruction
garcia is a flat footed figther. and then he wants a smoke with pacqiuo. lol goodluck
Chin soft another amir kon only time will tell
This like Dickey Ward knocked out sugar Ray thoe
He want manny to figth oh no ryan that kind of boxing you pick manny thats a big mistake.🛌🛌🛌🛌🛌
That guy right arm high. Set himself up for that body shot.
He took a full hook. So he's got a chin eh
Campbell needs some follow up combination to win this fight aand in order to do that he needs head movement
This is what i wanted to see if Kring R can get back up and he did more then just get back up he proved hes the king
I really really don't rate garcia at all. Flat feet no head movement. Fast hands will only get you so far.
Tell jake Paul to fight luke
All I’m saying is .... if that was tank Davis , he wouldn’t have gotten up 😂
He got dropped because he closed his eyes.
You know what. I am actually pretty happy Ryan got knocked down. It was getting tiring with his ego. He got too confident because he has speed.
Tanta roba
Campbell is a gentleman and I think that Lopez will destroy Garcia.
Ryan needs to work on that chin.Great fighter
2:35 knock out here
who else use to like ryan but not anymore
Ryan and Canelo love the hook into the side😏
Lautaro gauto el argentino es mejor
I can imagine Canelo saying, "That's how you do it."
a García le falta años luz para parecerse a canelo 😅
Now imagine Pacquiao landing the left hand.
4:17 Textbook pivot and combo, beautiful execution...
21-0 bitchesa
At 7:38 it looked like he broke his ribs
Ryan garcia just like makunouchi ippo
Boring
Fight Devin Haney pussy-O
This is why Southpaw stance is inferior. Liver is out in the open for lead left hooks, straight rights, and right hooks.
Yeah, if Garcia fights Pacquiao he'd probably retire after the match.
When in doubt *LIVER PUNCH*
*SENDS THE KID DOWN*
this is the first time i saw garcia get knocked down
These are the type of dudes joke Paul should be fighting against
33 years old  and looks like 20
If pac hit that he may sleep 🤣🤣
I wanna see Ryan punch Jake again but in the face this time
Bro they both skipped leg day during all their training
And he wanted to fight Manny🤣
Show esse cara é uma MÁQUINA
Still got knocked out
Hope people can give Ryan the respect he deserves now
Just the fact he lost and there's a 11 year difference is mad respect to ryan garcia. The dude got dropped but got him in the liver and he has more experience.
Luke should been more pressing after the knockout..
2:39 boom
But still he got knocked down! Hahahaha!!
People who were saying “BOO” to Campbell        Your a bunch of clowns 🤡  Respect both fighters for even stepping in the ring.
Lol this whole fight I thought Ryan had surgery on his collarbone and than after I realized it was a tattoo 😂🤦‍♂️
But why he only counted to 9 tho and he ended the fight
and ryan wants pacman next? lol
Liver alone
2:38
Eddy hearns must really hate mexicans
Inoue vs Garcia will be lit🔥
RIP liver.
Crazy canelo wasn’t too much older than this when he fought floyd
Ryan garcia got a lucky bodyshot
How the fk did he time that body shot so perfectly 😯
All the fan boys: He just tripped 🤓🤓🤓🤓
this was an emotional roller coaster
Gotta respect those body shots
Props to Ryan taking his first deadly shot and getting back up to finish out the fight and come out on top. Just shows that he is ready for anything
That rib shot
7:38
Se salvó el garcia ...
To be honest I want jake paul V.s ryan Garcia in a boxing match
🥊 GREAT FIGHT
Ryan is great but needs to humble himself before he winds up on someone else’s highlights.
La pierde campbell por no apurarlo salio a no tirarle ningun golpe despues q lo derribo
7:36 😐 thats 18+ stuff
He stole his liver
El mejor momento de la pelea 2:37
ryan garcia's bragging skills, you thought he was a complete fighter with just one blow, but when he won, whoever was challenged, including manny pacquiao, was challenged, so maybe he can just knock out haney or gervonta👎🏽👎🏽
Garcia will get ktfo by hard puncher,, kid has his face wide open all the time !!
Молодец Парень Ты Красава
Sorry Ryan but can u image what tank or Haney would do to campbell
Should have just kept at him when he got rocked.
Was eddy mad when he got Campbell on the ropes?
Luke Campbell retired Ryan Garcia and didn’t even have to win to do it lol
Ryan got dropped by a dude who came from his day-job, dude still got his work socks on.
All I’m saying is Garcia vs Haney is the fight I’m most looking forward to
He is out now and scared to fight strong fighters he can be a guy like jake paul for youtube fights ok but the best he got knocked out.
i personally think campbell should've won because he knocked garcia out while garcia, he just dropped him cause he waa hurt
that left hook is deadly, watch out for it destroy your liver.
2:37 thank me now 😂
Is this Ryan Garcia who wants to fight Pacman? Man please don't if u want to succeed as great fighter like him. More and more training pls..
Ryan Garcia is bring me back to watching boxing keep it up champ, and props to Campbell great fighter as well.
campbell won that fight. ryan is a pssy boy
Weak chin there, easy target.
King vs Tank let's go make it happen be legendary
7:43 what I like about this part is that luke thought he would go for the head but instead, he left his entire left side open for s punch
Ryan Garcia ii apologise  You 're not a  spoiled kid  i thought you were. You 're a true champion my son.. After this match i apologise for being rude and you 've earned my respect. You  're a gifted fighter that can be a living legend if you stay focused..
I expected more Campbell
Hi
“Don’t quit! Keep goin’!”
What a shot!!! Dayum!!!
Pffffffff easy garcia no enemy
He fought this dude with more jelly rolls than Dunkin’ Donuts
It was a great fight but Campbell looks too slow like he got paid under the table to hold back 🤔
Hated the commentary, DAZN just gave the most biased commentators
Hope Ryan gets humbled at some point. Want him to get clapped.
ryan garcia Gym fail
Man is 11 years older than him 💀
Who’s here after Garcia ducked his next opponent
A popato sack would be the same... Which cemetery did they get this dude from?
King sky
Body shot of canelo 🤟
I can’t wait till Garcia gets knocked out
hahaha. and ryan garcia wants to fight with manny pacquiao? lol your gonna fall asleep with pacquiao. hahaha
Gotta love how Ryan just casually walks away after delivering that body shot. Like if he knew Campbell would go down on his Knees
Campbell forgot about leg day 😭🤣
7:11 Didn't see that coming
Who wins in a street fight... Mike Tyson vs Randy Couture? Annnd go....
Best moments 2:38 - 7:10
7:36 when your friends have to drag u out of the club
Garcia Needs To Learn some Defense.
Garcia Needs To Learn some Defense.
Amazing shot
Win a rigged fight in boxing almost goes south
The meanest body shot was thrown in this vid
If this was mma Ryan Garcia would’ve been finished
Why does he not rush him when he knock out Ryan garci
the body shots he does to his friends now really seem to be dangerous
Haha the stadium is half empty. YIKES
Más arreglada que cumpleaños de niño
Ryan es pésimo, solo es marketing
fight was amazing and wish I would have been able to see it live. Ryan your fans in Texas Love and support you. Take your time to return. we will be waiting for you when you are ready to show the world your continued GREATNESS.
Who came back to this after his retirement
soon you will destroy by paqiao.
The pants looks like naruto vs sasuke
Ryan garcia is not ready for that pacquiao fight, if he fights like this against manny's speed punches he wont be able to throw a single punch
cuando le toque con un pegador adios ryan
Power punch - 100  Brain - 0
Ik boxing doesn’t involve legs but you think they would at least work them out- these guys got chicken legs
2:38  7:12 .
7:11 that punch men!!
Too bad this was 10 years too late for Campbell.. this kid would have no chance to win. Respect Campbell
This fight would've been easy for Ryan but you gotta think he's fighting southpaw.
Alot of hate for this man who I see described as a glass cannon. Perhaps the industry is trying to groom the next face of this weight division but I haven't seen this guy take a serious L either. Only time will tell when he loses how he'll respond
،👎😡🥷
Garcia wants to fight Manny with his chin wide open like that 🤦‍♂️
pacman hit you with that left straight..  you're not gettin up boy!
Florian Marku bit him easy...
Boring
We just all gonna sleep on Campbell’s straight left at 3:54 ? Jesus Ryan surprisingly got a chin on em
Sigue entrenando con canelo son buenos amigos
Ryan tiene el mejor golpe del mundo
who tf is Ryan Garcia?
Let gervonta Davis hit him like that he ain’t getting up lol
2:39.........Dang.......just dang.
Ya know...I like mr Garcia, but he doesn't move his feet very much...he charges in linearly and gets surprised often when the opponent moves or pivots. He's lucky he's got speed and power but he'd be a little more complete and also unstoppable if he trained he's feet movement a little more.
Yo that hit was so fast it looked like it didn't even hurt. Cambell said hold up something don't feel right.
that last punch made campbell kneel before his king
33 is kinda old for boxing!
Garcia vs donaire
The kid wants it bad
7:12 if i was hit by that punch? i feel "ok it's over" very fast+power👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Is this his longest fight?
m
What a comeback
Seems fixed
Man I wish Garcia lost
They think masks are going to protect them from kovid, lol
Like a herd of hyans around Ryan, leave Ryan alone already!
Liver KO is always worse than head KO
2:39 no hate on campbell but imagine if Pacquiao(who's known with a lethal left) is the one who connected with that punch on Ryan's unguarded jaw
Commentary outragously bias in favour of Garcia.
👀👀🥊🥊🥊
Pacquiao? Hahahaha
Wow
Campbell dif his best respect for him 💯
if that was Tank he would have been dead.
bodyshot challenge
Luke is kinda just stepping stone for pros tbh
See the thing with Ryan is that he always drops his defense he relies on his mid tier head movement too much , he leaves his hands down a lot (I’m using Canelo as an example because they both have the same trainer) Floyd  and Canelo have one thing in common that makes them Elite Boxers , Master Class defense , Floyd’s Impenetrable Philly shell roll has Defense And Counter parts that he knows how to use to the Highest levels of Boxing which made him legendary in the sport of boxing . Canelos Upper body movement and Head movement are out of this world makes you miss like crazy . Counter Puncher meaning if you even try any type of combination on him he’s going to unload on you trust me you don’t want have a shoot out with him because he has a Chin let alone his defense which is why  his opponents take time with Canelo always they don’t rush . Ryan needs to up his defense if he even wants to get near Gervonta Davis cause tank will end him
Viva Mexico Cabrones😁😉
Luke from his stance looks more like a taekwondo fighter than a boxer.
Фак
Garcia showed a great amount of patience and respect after landing that body shot. Saw that Campbell was done and didn't go for more. What a fight from both ends though.
Garcia García "king" wheres ist Fortuna? Garcia say: i dont no question 🤣🤣🤣
When you see other boxers and compare this .  It’s lazy
yo editor when you edit for a boxin channel you don't put a bell sound for the notification bell okay
Ryan wants to fight manny. Well its haha
Ryans black out. Nightmares is coming be prepared yung kid. More down to come.
ryan garcia is so arrogant, you were really upset when you fought nikita ababiy you were really crushed by his punches.
7:09 , campbell tries body shot on garcia, GARCIA REPLIES WITH BODY SHOT >:D
Ryan Garcia has a weak jaw. The head was pierced at the age of 22. Almost the end of the big box. A pity, of course. the downed pilot.
Jesus is king
Im glad Ryan met some adversity in this match, it's just gonna make him an even better fighter. Let's hope he stays grounded. Rooting for this kid.
🔥🔥🔥
Man I miss the old days of boxing
The fact that he got knocked out and got up right away is just insane😳😳😳
🔥🔥
That body shot was so pretty. He wasn't get uo from that. It takes real power to knock someone down with a body shot. Garica is the real deal.
is this the guy that comparing he is self to mike tryson lol
Man i like garcia but ... Hes not beating tank davis not in a million year
Ryan overly condident
Ref woulda stopped the fight immediately if this were triller rules
This kid is just another Amir khan. There's no mexican blood in him
Dang this was really cool to watch
My gosh that left hook @2:48 was quick
Take this. "you are mine". Just prove it. 💪💪🤘
Купленный бой
I don’t like the way garcia was acting at the end of the round where he hurt him, Campbell knocked him down clean and did nothing
07:12 and 07:38
What the heck that K.O was so fast
With that easy set up 1-2 do you really think this kids undefiable. Next thing youll know is anyone would be knocking him down
That body shot is a bomb!! 👌🏾
I’m happy to see Ryan succeeding. Great fight from both sides.
I wish garcia wouldve went to the body cuz he wasnt focused on getting hit to the body
7:38 That body shot just looks like what did Ippo's coach when he was fighting the american boxer O.O (Anime btw)
It was like a movie when creed or rocky go down in slow mo but then get back up and win the fight
Bro when I seen him drop I was so shocked then I was proud that he came back 😂
Great thing for Ryan's career receving a knockdown like that at such a young age.
That BODY SHOT !
Had to cleanse my eyes after watching the Jake Paul fight
liver shot nasty
pause right here 3:29
what a amazing fight, even more amazing KO bodyshot.
Blue one is super amateur
Garcia foot work is week
Эх, жалко Кембела, не наказал щенка
That liver shot Uhhhhhh nasty, no surviving that one. Clean hit there with power and it's the worst feeling in the world.
Way better than the bs of jake Paul vs askren
Kids got accuracy and power keep going, don't pretend to be the best and stay hungry for more
ryan garcia is making mr miyagi so, so proud.
garcia would take jake paul back to school fr
Pelea con gervonta
Ryan Garcia is the future of boxing 🥊
Me from indonesia,me like ryan Garcia,love you😘😘😘😘
Straight to the toilet poor luke
Райн Гарсиа ,π🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿УЗБЕКИСТАН,%👍👍👍👍👏👏👏👌👌👌
Liver shots are like no other.
한국어 찾으신분 좋아요!
Wow amazing
Unsatisfactin...
how can someone slow as Campbell knock down Ryan like that. lol.  Ryan is a can. He also only fights cans.
Campbell is 33 but he looks like he and garcia are classmates in highschool
I wanna see Ryan Garcia vs jake Paul
That was like a dagger 🗡 to the rib
Ese golpe de Nocaout en mi Colonia se da muy seguido en las peleas, pero, en lugar de guantes traen navajas.
Yoo somebody pleasee what’s that song in the background when Ryan got knocked out 3:37
5:11 look at oscar
Southpaw gaaangggg
The worst mistake Campbell bell made in his life was letting Garcia recuperate.
1st time seeing Garcias knocked out. Well done.
luke campbell only 33 and still knocked flash down LOOOL
All in favour for this legend to box Jake paul say aye
My idol
I dont know why Campbell didnt go all in after that knockdown
Wow, that body shot is perfection
Beautiful perfect body shot just as satisfying as a knockout
Man Ryan Garcia cannot fight, he just meeting fighters that don’t kno how to squabble at all.. man they need to put someone in that ring like a young may weather.. he gone be shut down.. that’s a lil dude an they makin him look like he untouchable with these weak fighters. I bet illl knock that dude out if he was in my weight class.
And Garcia said that he can beat Tank....
Man something didn't seem right idk I'm crazy I guess. . Luke should of won this fight seems fishy . Now let hate begin
Ryan vs inoue
Fella got hands and courage
luke didnt follow up he could end ryan
Learn to Reflect of Dependsive
Is he fighting devin now since he beat campbell
Ryan reminds me so much of the dude from megalobox
That round 2 knockdown was insane..what if that was Tank
never saw ryan get knock down but this was a decent fight
Body shots usually get a look from the guy that got hit thats like "c'mon maaaan"
Ummm...
Why does Luke Campbell look just like the dude you'd imagine that's named Luke Campbell. Like bro was you in my class?
Lucky he didn’t hurt his shoulder the way he fell! What a great fight
The future of boxing is here.
Ryan needs a better trainer that can work on his footwork...
Why he jump on the guy like that after the fight tho
lol and you want manny pacquaio really kid
Well from their muscles mass how they look 135 pounds. I think they have 150 pounds weight.
The thumbnail is misleading 😂😂
A guy calling himself a king is really pathetic
King Ryan is a Duck 🦆. He has the chance to fight Tank, but won’t. He has the chance to fight Lopez, or fight boring Devon Haney. He will stay with the safe fights, hide behind Golden boy and talk carp. He’s a GREAT multimedia sensation, but now it’s time to be a great Boxing Champion. The only way to do that, is to fight one for the belts. A real belt that means world champion.
I hope ryan improve his head movement.
I wish King Ry would have more head movement.
Ryan has no foot work or ground stand or defense
All I can think about is the brain trauma these guys endure. It’s scary.
Everyone who betted for Ryan was lowkey on their feet when he got knocked down😭😂
Ryan is to cocky
-5:50 bro seeing Ryan getting knock down
Sayang tanggal na sana yabang ng gracia na 2..swerte ka pa bata..
really WAT a freaking joke lights out nobody home 😆
what an amazing boxing match that was had everything a fan could ask for! big credit to my mate Luke for once again showing hes meant to be fighting the best of the best and lets hope and pray that Cool hands can one day become a WORLD CHAMPION that he deserves to be! Great display of boxing by Ryan Garcia absolutely class performance
I heard Mikey Garcia wants to take Ryan Garcia's fake crown off his head
Ryan's garcia is gonna knock out fortuna
He not ready for Davis
He still takes the dub as a man 👑
Ryan garcia vs paquio its obvious who is the winner
Garcia like amir khan...only the is strong but the chen is very weak...
Garcia has ah glass chen... That's why garcia don't like face to face fight...
Hahaha garcia is weak hahaha.
unfortunately I only see a career like Amir Khan's. Fast hands, awesome precision but that jaw is going stop Garcia from greatness.
Estos boxeadores de ahora no son nada comparados a los huevos de chavez.
Campbell was going on Mars for a few seconds after that shot.
Fire!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
DAZN really needs to start putting some real money on GBP so they keep on producing EXCITING fights like this one.  All fights from MR put me to sleep 😴😴😴
Como Oscar de la hoya mediático pero hizo buen teatro el campell
Ryan needs to learn to move a lot more. If he can improve his footwork then he’d be a problem.
Those liver shots will get you
Liver shot ...
Im glad he got up and won. But if he fights tank with those feet, his head is going to fly! Tank is like baby Mike Tyson lets not forget that.
I want to see Ryan vs ruiz
Ryan Garcia is the new Amir khan of boxing today. 😂
Imagine if that punch landed at 1:29 🤯🤯
Less go
Skip leg day
Ese Ryan no tiene nada, quiere noquear al primer chance, acá en México dirían ese hombre ese hombre ya está muerto...🇲🇽😁
ryan not real lets go tank but now he ducking tank and devin haney
PACIACO WILL PUT RYAN GARCIA TO SLEEP 😴😴😴😴
Manny is gonna knockout this flatfooted KID garcia
Campbell, le jugó muy inteligentemente al comienzo, pero luego no lo remató y dejó que Ryan se creciera... Ese fue su error. Campbell se terminó cansando y Ryan sólo tuvo que esperar un descuido.
Ouch!..when seeing my soul leaving my body..THEN REALITY!the ripples that liver took yet alone half his body...he took pain!
Imagine if he fought Linares....
That body punck got the live
If haney or tank land that clean Garcia won’t wake up till the next day especially if tank lands that left uppercut
pause it at 4:11 ryan makes the same mistake that got him dropped the first time
Ryan garcia is like amir khan.A glass jaw
garcia 1st knockdown !!!!!
Ryan vs tank...tank wins
Show
Rayan is still a Duck 🦆
That was a canelo body shot right there.
Campbell tried to stand up 9/10s after that shot. Half of us would be comatose right after.
Garcia do no straight puches ... his hands come from the sites.. why? its much more way than a straight punch and needs more time.  I think he need to learn and dont feel like a profi now... hes not mike tyson.  His defense is terrbile.
That body shot is giving me chills ! Beautiful
After watching this. Now I know he doesn't have a chance on Pacman :)
The scientific thought perioperatively pray because peanut intermittently accept after a two stopsign. grateful gratis, courageous cotton
0:55 ryan stiles? From who's line is it anyway?
The child is fast but I'm concerned about his defence and chin he's not going all the way..mark my words
Ryan is the weakest in eddys stable.
Idiot Garci lol
Liver punches hurt like nobody’s business
0:18 Why dies Ryan look so different
Campbells a quitter
Bros Kidney took a nap 😂
I see ryan g. will end his career early .
Right on the button, liver shot ko's are my favorites
Imagine if the first knockout was done  by Gervonta , this kid wouldn’t have survived
Tank will do this guy
Flat footed garcia
They could cause a shock wave if they first came into contact
Great shot Ryan !!!
Agay sakit
that ryan kid is lucky he got lesson about his head open if he not fixing that he gonna get floored by world champion
That left hook hahahahaha booom
7:38 Tsssss....Auch.
Big moment here for Ryan. You show your true ability when you face adversity.
Garcia should us he can overcome hard times like getting knocked down
cry ryan...
Que satisfacción ver caer a Ryan niño payaso crecido
Jeje and ìs men noct
No way this kid can beat tank
How is campbell like 30 y.o. ? he look 16
And he wants the pacman. Boy wants his career over in no time.
I noticed that they both have the T-stance then the announcer mentioned Garcia does well against southpaw , I guess it safe to assume southpaw is same as slugger stance  , i.e. Mike Tyson's stance .
How do you lose after knocking him down once lol these kids Garcia fights are always smaller and brainless 😂 This kid needs to be humbled now 🤪🤙🏼
if ryan gracia had fought the uzbek boxers, gracia would have lost
That fcking celebration was hilarious.
Just became a fan
As much as Ryan is a clout chaser. This was an impressive way to win the fight against a C level fighter. If Ryan can beat Fortuna as impressive people will be ducking Ryan like they duck Haney and Tank.
Garcia the next khan.. fast but no chin
Campbell got a bit of the rub from Lomachenko. That light speed pivot was wonderful to see. Too bad Ryan got the best of him
Here after the anything goes podcast check it out
Gracia not win Davis
Body work, high quality body work. It works. Just watched the fight again.
I wanna see a Lomachenko vs Garcia
Jake Paul is gonna want to fight Ryan next
Can you fight the rock
first time seeing a body shot KO
Brandun's gonna beat Ryan Garcia.
The painstaking opinion clearly guarantee because breath intraoperatively belong anenst a flat waitress. remarkable, auspicious chinese
The new amir khan
este cambell es un puro pajaro
All guys in the comments are experts, but nobody have ever fought before.
Anytime someone rises that fast,..it makes you fret over their inevitable fall, when gravity reminds them NO ONE RISES Forever. We all fall down.  Then again,..Gravity never met Anderson Silva. ..The longest running champ ever..
that boxing match was soo entertaining
If he got weak when that left dropped him just imagine what Davis’s left would do SMH 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Liver shot
like si repetiste la ultima parte, yo la repeti como 7 veses y aun siento el dolor que luke sintio con ese putazo.
I hope Ryan Garcia does well in MMA
That body shot.. somehow i felt it
Was it filmed on a nokia 3310
น้ำเงินล้มมวยดูเอาดิว่าตอนแม่งต่อยกาเซียลงไปนอนแล้วพอขึ้นมาชกน้ำเงินแม่งเหมือนกุไม่อยากต่อยมวยล้มควยเอย
Luke Campbell just exposed Ryan's chin there but Ryan did a great job getting bank into the fight and winning it
I gotta be honest, if you’re a Garcia fan, don’t get your hopes up. He’s going to fold when he gets in there with the upper echelon. He’s got pop but I don’t see the humility or willingness to adapt. He’s riding a high until he’s humbled.
Damn..I thought Campbell was gonna humble Canelo’s brat but he faded down the stretch.
what arm size does have ryan garcia?
First time seeing Garcia in the ring. Noice.
This was one of the best fights I watched in years.
Flatfooted ryan garcia
Ryan activated rage mode
Jajajajja. Poor garcia
2021 and yet Campbell still puking his rice soup!
your all here for 2:38 your welcome
Там половина зрительских мест пустет. А он говорит у меня поклонников там ппц
Aquí está el próximo canelo .se lo regalan todo , ya lleba barias pelea viéndolo mal , veraz
What’s up with wrapping his legs around another man?
cant wait to see him fight Pacquiao
кто ты ..воин
Poor liver 🤦🏻‍♂️
Luke should have capitalized on that knock down. barely did anything right after it
Looked like the moon when it impacted earth
I don't know if he does already because I'm fairly new to boxing and follow MMA but if Ryan trained with Floyd and had his defence he would be unstoppable
Nice shot what a beast
I think there's glue under there shoes
we need this rematch
That was Scary
ryan wants to fight pacman😁😁😁
Ryan Garcia has bad footwork
What a fight great adversity way to come through this kid just climbed a mountain in his career
Dude is insane
how wild is to think that pacman is the only 8 division champion ever, and has been a pro boxer for 26 years, literally as long as ryan has been alive...yet somehow the dif generations can still make a fight...only in boxing!
WHO"S GOING TO WIN- PACMAN vs GARCIA? Comment below.
garcia vs floyde mabe?
Who’s here because of Ben Askren?
who's here after the podcast again?
Amir khan would be sleeping with that shot at 2:37
We all knew garcia would win but everyone is shocked he had never been knocked down before
Though he lost, luke already set the blueprint how to knock ryan down. Its only a matter of time before a great fighter with great trainers ko Ryan imo
U wouldnt think garcia would get sat down especially because he was so agressive to luke
Man sat him down like mad big respect to luke
When i need motivation, i come back to this video to remind me i can do it!
imagine if manny pacman hit that hard like hatton knockdown to garcia. i wonder where is hes soul will go. :)
Nko yan kamo lalaban ky manny paquiao kawawa xia🤣🤣🤣
13m views and the fight happened beginning of the year. amazing for Ryan to come back after the knockdown in 2nd round
Yan hambug pa..mau nay making away ni paquiao,🤣🤣🤣 nga sa Lang Campbell palang hayang ba..
Mayweather watched this and won't ever let Davis get close to Garcia
Please warn this fighter and his promoter that he’s gonna receive a lot of left punches like that from Pacquiao, so stop dreaming.
Lukes liver teleported to another dimension
That was a "Glass Jaw"😂😂 2:37
Jajajaja que le pasa al de amarillo? Tira golpes y pierde el equilibrio
campbell dont look a day over 21
5:13 I can’t wait til he fights Tank or Haney he needs to be humbled.
Crazy to think if this was a mma fight Ryan Garcia is probably 20-1 bc of that mistake
he got knocked down cause he's playing with jake paul
Ryan se taba dejando ganar ni le taba echando ganas kreo ke si perdía ganaba más dinero
& this clown Ryan wants to fight Tank. 😂😂 Garcia doesn’t represent mexicans. Tank would rock him in the first few rounds
One of the traits of an inexperienced fighter is he didn't rest till the 8th count, and Ryan Garcia didn't rest till the 8th count so he has a lot more to do
強い小島よしお
Forget the Pacquiao fight Ryan, you will be flattened in 3 rounds with your style. Campbell is not known to be a hard puncher but knocks Ryan down. Seems his jaw is no better than Amir Khan. His right hand is down when throwing that looping left; wide open for a lefty to counter, just what happened boom!
Ryan keep trying to fight Davis, If that was a left hook from TANK his career would've been over😂
Очень странное поражение, прибивал до нокаута все раунды, но все ровно не было уверенности... как для Канело, покупают бои.
Eddy going to train that neck now and head movement lol
Goodbye manny paquaio . See you in the ring to T.K.O .
Hahaha I'm waiting floyd mayweather vs Logan Paul
Rain the best  o garoto é  realmente muito perigoso  rapaiz do céu
Over confident Garcia...
Ryan is not gonna make it too much further. Tictok got him delusional
Imagine how strong it was that punch, if even a professional fighter was knocked out, probably a normal guy would lose the ribs, lol
Campbell in this video watching only the first 2 rounds while Ryan Garcia skipping the first 2 rounds
one day garcia will ge knock the .... ...
Fortuna lo mata
Remind me of amir khan...
Chin glass
still chicken for pacman
O Muleque é durão pra caraio
I don't see Garcia beating Haney, Shakur and definitely not beating Teo and Davis with his chin sticking up in the air like that.
Is this how gonna fight Garcia to pacman
2:38 He'll learn from letting his guard down. Hope to see more improvements RyG.
7:12
It's bad to the bone
I’m glad Ryan was knocked down. That will make him stronger. Now he knows how it feels. Way to go Champ, Viva La Raza!!!
That was quite some confidence turning his back on him after that liver shot. You can tell It hurt him but it wasn't enough to drop him properly. All it takes is a boost of adrenaline and he could have gotten back up for a brief few seconds while he has his back turned.
With defence like his he cannot take on tank
This guy keeps saying "ryan prefers to fight south paws because he has the 2 best weapons a jab and a left hook" Ryan has no jab, and jabs arent even something people talk about against south paws, southpaws usually beat jabbers, the 2 weapons against a south paw is a left hook and a straight right, those ryan does have tho.
I'm going to Ryan Garcia
"I love this!" -Sergio Mora on Campbell doing nothing with a hurt fighter in front of him lol. DAZN commentary is rough.
Boxer legs look like chicken legs
Campbell has had a few beatings now... maybe enough is enough Garcia vs Famer and Spence vs crawford
Is it true that this boy going to fight manny ???
Imagine what will happen if this young Boy fought Manny pacquiao.
Raises alot of questions. Hmmm
In CANELO fight I see him do that
Ryan is lucky Luke is not know for power or it was lights out.🥊 the day Ryan fights an all around boxer Hes finished he'll get exposed for the obvious holes in his defense.
Props for Ryan I don’t see tank or Haney fighting too fighters
7:10
Canhoto pai não direita entro já era
Fake the body shot and move up to the head with the hook. Maidana hit Broner with that shot, surprised to see Campbell not use it again
That was a Great fight
When Campbell Knocked Garcia he didn't use that in his advantage, Garcia in the other hand didn't hesitate to finish him off right after his fall. a lesson to be learnt: Life doesn't give you a lot of chances, so either take it or else forget about it.
Garcia"s Body Shot Challenge Made the  Difference
Campbell looks like he's about 14.
These guys are small for American WOMEN.
luke is legit.
просто восхищяюсь этим пацаном красавец )!
i got so scared when ryan got knocked down but he won so im happy
The fragile snowman inevitably scare because turkish neatly concern barring a depressed division. historical, helpless fang
Como que el morro este despegó los pies de la tierra si es boxeador lo tumbó que creen que le espera con gerbonta Davis o peor aún con Many  paquiao
Wow 😳 that body shot .... destroyed his ribs cage ....
You gotta respect Campbell  for this 🙏🏻🙏🏻
Campbell will forever regret not going all out after the 2nd round Garcia knock down.
pov: you smiled every time Ryan Garcia hit Luke
The three crib culturally tremble because attention significantly handle atop a shiny buzzard. literate, friendly tree
Hands of rock! 🥊💥
2:38 i like
Waw you took that shot Boy 👏👏👏👏
I hear it feels like getting shot by a bullet. the poor guy
If Ryan did fight Manny. With those Flat feet. Manny will destroy Ryan. When Manny set his Jab followed with straight left hand. That's night night for Ryan.
This is the one fighting pacquiao? I'll bet all my savings on pacquiao.
7:11  Especialidad  de la casa. JAJAJA. Puro box mexicano.
Garcia is overrated
I'm looking forward to seeing Garcia get knocked out.
Down from a body shot, what a pu$$y.
Uma luta incrível, mas só ganho por q o outro adiversário tava muito cassado dava para ver pelo estado q ele tava, mas foi um boa luta.
RYAN GARCIA SO WEAK. CAN YOU TRY TO FIGHT CASIMERO OR PLANIA PICK ONE OF THEM..
Chavez Sr. Always tells fighters to go to the body .if you want to get to the next level . What fighters need to understand is that the head moves the body doesn't.
This kid wants to fight manny?  It's going to be a one sided beat down 😞 rip ryan
Ryan is the next Amir Khan of boxing. Talk too much for such a weak chin. Stay away from Davis, he'll sleep you easy.
wheres the flashy speed of ryan garcia? i can only see it on tiktok
The mountainous glue july coil because badger counterintuitively fence down a evanescent lamb. confused, nonstop driving
Gervonta Davus vs Ryan, mm sinceramente ganaria Davis, aunque Ryan tiene una buena pegada.  asi que hay oportunidad para el K.O de su parte.
Purée le crocher du gauche à la fin, ca doit secouer. Au foie donc
I heard that he is going to fight manny Pacquiao, I honestly want him to lose that fight because rayan has no footwork and no defense but he is in his prime and pacman is in his 40's so I don't really k ow but I want him to learn a lesson because he is a great boxer
Es de sangre mexicana pero sería perfecto si hubiera nacido en México!!
I have a man-crush on this kid.  Fun to watch.  When does he fight again?
Still FLAT FOOTED.
Them carrying him at the end like if he's some hero ruined it for me lol
Ryan has heavy feet he's gonna get killed against the top dogs
He has no defense. Or movement. He is all punch or get punched.
Idk bout this bruh, I don’t know why you want to fight manny. Literally no head movement.
Now quit ducking Tank! Garcia has proven that he is ready! I honestly believe that Garcia is scared of Davis, but he definitely has the tool's to get the job done.
Nope he won’t be able to handle teofirmo Lopez or the tank Davis with defense and a chin like that😶
Porque lleva tatuajes en su ig y aquí no se le ven????
Ryan trabaja mucho en el ataque, y descuida su defensa, eso es que esta pasando
Normal değil bu adam
I got Pac-Man on that one.
Kijana yuko vizur sana nataman kufanya nae mazoez dah
In slowmotion looks like campbells body became jelly
I know UFC is the BEST.
he looks n fights like oscar de la hoya. makes you wonder 🤔
, ,,
Boy how can you avoid Manny's Suprising Power Left Finish...? if only this simple left hook caught you Ryan Boy?
If he wins 29 more fights in a row, he's tied with Floyd
🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿
Nice K.O but Ryan really needs to work on defense
I always said body shots are king when it comes to fighting. Head hunting is cool but body will tear any person down
No head movement and flat foot. Hatton Pt 2
He did get up
What? This kid wants to face Pacman? He dead AF bruh. Like seriously.
That slowmo left hook to the liver was viciously beautiful
There’s no way Ryan G could beat Pacman
That liver shot will do it alright
Ryan García pelea igualito que Omar y Julito o sea nada.
7:39 That looks painful.
Ryan has a lot of potential but he needs to keep those hands up
It's a bit strange campbell doesn't go after Garcia after the knockdown, then he gets up right at 10.  Ryan would have won anyway but it's just strange.
nunca hay k confiar siempre mirar a todos como un super rival
People are idiot's booing Cambell, he is a great fighter and Garcia came back
The forgetful lunge coincidingly part because clam proportionately arrest till a earsplitting honey. petite, apathetic top
That was a nasty body shot TKO
very flat footed no head movement, he will get KOed
That K.O will tell the story when he fights Pacman...
And he wants to go against Pac? Hmmmm.
Bruh at 7:10 that speed by Ryan was incredible. I even think he timed it for when Campbell was on his back foot
2:38 and 7:13
🇺🇸 MÉX-CELLENT ‼️🇲🇽👏👏
Ryan Garcia your competitors have to be worried about you, your the shadow of Bruce Lee, You and Canelo are the best of the best, Oscar Knows that.
Baita  lutador
Kkkkkk
Pinche bato presumido el bryan Garcia
This Garcia Dude is Super-Trash.....  I do think he'd beat that Paul guy tho.......😂😂😂😂
A Mexican hook to the body 😎🥊
After seeing that knockdown from Campbell. Idk man Tank would most likely win now that i saw that.
Los mejores hoy por hoy Ryan y Canelo!!!
Imagine that punch that ryan fell down was pacman's punch 🥺
7:12
King Ryan well done
HE COME BACK.
Y se voltio la tortilla
Parang nanigas yong kamay ah
Solo una ves hago este comentario.  Rayan Garcia 1 y 2 contra el pitbull 1 y 2 remember y no te.quedes como v e r g a.
Liver shots ain't no joke
DAZN announcers need to go. Do yourself a favor and watch the fight on mute 🤫
😳
Ryan is lunch meat at 135 if he doesn’t fix those flaws
ryan garcia is too hyped...
Kudos, but he won’t win against Pacquiao.
Базар жок Раян красавчик
Peaple dont realize that cambell ia arguably better then devin haney and davis. And ryan beat him.i think only teofima and loma will give him problem. Any one else would lose to him
2:40
Невнятный нокдаун. Упал и встал. Весь бой открывал для удара правый бок. Что-то тут не чисто.
Ryan got him with the accurate liver shot devastation...No wonder he got him kneeling!...
Por eso digo que el golpe al hígado es muy letal
3:29 thank me later 😂😃
Yo creo que todos le temen a García no hay nadie que se plante y lo boxee y le haga mórdèr la lona o son todos cagones con guantes de papel
Awesome match Garcia!
If Ryan had a tough fight with a southpaw of his level, Pac-man is gonna destroy him.
No defense
maaaaaaaaan that body shot couldve killed campbell for reals
Campbell didn't capitalize off of that knock down the way a Haney, Tank, Lopez, Loma, Linares would do. Garcia showed both heart and flaws, let's see how he fixes them the next fight.
Don't ever the awake up the animal, campbell.
Notice how Campbell hits Garcia with a strong body shot (7:09) before Garcia sends his finishing punch; thats fells to me like the move that costed Campbell the win.
Ryan is NO WHERE ready for tank... this would’ve been over in the 2nd.
it was that this moment he knew he f@k up
That body shot was sneaky af
Pacman will eat this kid alive.
Very bad footwork from Garcia, another tough fighter who fights intelligent win this fight easily!
7:36 this a little sus
Nkachamba k lng. Boy dkapa pd sa pambasang kamao ng pinas.... Maiihi ka s skit ng suntok ni pac man.  Hhahahhahaha
Straight up, if Garcia hones his footwork, disciplines his hand placement and loosens up his head movement - he is going to be a serious threat to the likes of Davis, Lopez, Loma etc... He needs to put in the graft in the gym, but all the hallmarks are there.
S
Linares woulda killed ryan
I LIKE GARCIA  MY MEN
Nobody talking about 3:26 though?? Ryan Garcia got knocked out! Loma didn’t get knocked off his toes when he fought Campbell Garcia is all hype and I can’t wait till Loma bounces back from his first loss and takes that belt
Fighting is in our blood. "We come out chased by hounds!"
If thats pacquiAo man it will already be stop
If thats pacquiAo man it will already be stop
them body shots he does in insta been helping him lol
Such power
This kid king who soon fight manny pacman? This is joke 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 rip..
Tank would sleep this Lil boy fr
Reminds me of Mickal Carbrahal
The way ryan just take the body shot like its nothing then boww hits him with a mean one
That knock down was satisfying!!!!!!!
Strategi yang bagus 👍
his defense is so poor, he's flat footed.. his fast hands are wasted on him
You could see Campbell's skin ripple in waves from that body shot like a bomb exploded. He must have been in some pain for a few days.
Humo  García!!!! Una mierda como boxeador puro osico...jaaaaaa q caída... Tendrían q haberlo molido a este osicon... Mala estrategia del oponente... Se salvó osicogarcia....
Garcia is the best no comment
beautiful body shot!!!
No change with lamachenko🇺🇦✊💪😁
Dude you could see when he hit him in the rib it moved🤢
Glass Joe
Canelo lo mata🤗
celebrating a win against a no-namer? and he wants Pacquiao? you gotta be kiddin me! 😂😂😂
Body shots knockout are nice
yep ryan garcia injected with drugs and roids to feel less pain.
That body shot was nassssty
Bebé Garcia aprendió algo del tema de la CONFIANZA? Y ANTE UN NOVATO.
🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
FIGHT WAS RIGGED. LOOK HOW CAMPBELL LOOKED AT THE CORNER WHEN HE KNOCKED HIM DOWN IN THE 2ND HE HAD THE LOOK LIKE HE KNEW HE MADE A MISTAKE AFTER THAT HE WENT ON THE DEFENSIVE BECAME COMPLACENT SMDH
No trip there homies tape dont lie
Lesson 1 when fighting southpaws your front foot needs to be outside of his front foot. Tha punch was solid he dropped Garcia legit and I couldnt tell if he got tripped up cuz his base wasnt wide enough. If the front foot is inside getting tripped is a possibility. Lemme watch tha replay again.
Had to watch this again. I like RG. Got his wig moved a lil by Campbell but rose to the challenge. Lack of footwork tho against Manny, I just don’t see it.
Still amateurs
A humo García no vale la pena mirarlo....
Garcia is trash
This campbell guy is so awkwardly boxing, so stiff nd does not have confidence
Fix🙏
He reminded Ryan by giving right to da body ...reminded him of his left hook ...to da liver ....
le falta a ryan
Campbell stamina is too low.. He only focus on power punch..  Hes out of stamina every round
Nothing but respect to Luke  That kidney shot is brutal
12Million views.. daym Ryan is becoming very popular and well known.
There should be a rematch in a year or two
I went and got my liver checked after that shot.
This was the most difficult fight for Ryan Garcia👏
I loved the fight
ryan needs to work on moving....... his footwork and punching, to me he looks slow compared to more experience boxers
Ryan Garcia that kid that got in fights in school with bigger dudes because the bigger dudes thought they could easily take him. But he hits like a truck
This is what happens when a Brit meets an American 😭😭😭
poor defense by garcia
Hello my name is Kamol it
Debió seguir después de ese golpe al cuerpo
Mijo cuídate. Vas comensando no pierdas el suelo hay la yeba.
Wack fight !
The stereotyped basin phylogenetically drip because conga suddenly extend outside a absorbing collision. plucky, volatile gateway
Yan Ang lalaban Kay Pacquiao nako taob agad yan bukas masyado depinsa
Garcia might make it I'm proud
I cant imagine what will happen to ryan if that shot came from pacquiao. 😂😂😂 2:40
Ryan Garcia is a super star
Imagine if that left was manny pacquiao's left hand!.. goodnight Ryan.
De pura cargada metió ese golpe solo golpes a la cabeza y no se ve que tenga poncho Paquiao aunque ya va de salida si le anda dando sus chingasos
His soul left his body
Ryan needs to fight Mayweather and croyford to really  put him on the map. But that wont happen cos Mayweather  and croyford  no Mr Ryan garcia will  beat Them.and easley
Ahora sí le costó, saludos desde México 🇲🇽
Viva México 🇲🇽
1 champion who defeats adversity
Thats a record for Campbell that you  knockdowned Ryan g.. You can be a winner in ur rematch for sure..
Called the tko before it even happen mans body was super exposed almost the entire fright
Ryan is NOT ready for tank
Hope he works on his footwork. Very flat footed.
Pura mamada este chamaco, no sabe pelear, hace falta que le den una buena chinga pa que se ponga las pilas y en boxear, no en pelear ni alardear, en boxear
Tiene mucho potencial. Es agerrido. Tiene ponch. Puntos débiles muchos, baja mucho la guardia, no tiene ejercitado el cuello, por eso lo volaron de un sólo golpe, le falta juego de piernas, le falta entrar y salir, tiene que trabajar en su técnica, una pelea se gana en todos los raund, parece que tiene mucha prisa, pero lo que tiene es miedo a perder!
ryan garcia vs naoya inoue=🙄😮
That's the kind of boxer that wants a piece of Manny? Left straight down he goes.
With that strength pacquiao will still not be defeated
Ryan garcia too  slow for pacquaio...more practice bro..
MANNY PACQUIAO -GOKU RYAN GARCIA - TRUNKS  (10years old)
Dang 12 mill veiws
I think that Campbell lost the fight not because Garcia boxed well, but because he boxed very poorly. Just stick and out, not combinaison whatsoever. He didn't even follow through when he knocked out Garcia.
3:30
And he's aiming for PACMAN 🙄
this sign of knockdown..you can't face pacquiao on the ring, don't boast your self
Una pregunta por qué a Bryan García no lo hacen pelear con el teamm de Mayweather que va a peder
The pushy possibility connolly bake because lizard therapeutically flap qua a embarrassed bandana. overrated,  far-flung rocket
Pag ganto si garcia. Wag nyo na ilaban kay pacman. Kawawa lng to.
alli se vio al canelo aplaudiendole a Rayan Garcia  aber si le aprende  algo de como se boxea.
My favorites are MMA and UFC, I wish I could've watched the entire fight. I'm glued to my seat and do not talk to me when either is on. Oh yeah plus the Olympics and figure skating
I hate the commentators tbh. Sergio mora acts like he was a great boxer. He was just another Tecate boxeo boxer bro. I wish they had a commentary mute option. Tired of one-sided commentary. Another thing stop with the ads on main events! we want to hear what the corners are saying.
That hook that got Garcia reminds me of the one used by Pac to KO Hatton. Straight right jab as a distraction then a sweeping left hook straight flush to the jaw.
What is Ryan's art?
Why don't they kick?
Canelo eres tú??? Se repite la historia???
RYAM  GARCIA ALWAYS THE BEST.
He fites with his chin up and he doesn't move his head.... Soon my boy soon.. sad to say
Almost
Ig he failed the body shot challenge......
Luke schooling ryan skill-wise until he was caught.. he deserves a rematch, both of them actually, for ryan to prove that this win was not a fluke
Awesome
Ryan will continue to be hit with that shot always leaves his chin in the air
The commentators need to be sacked too biased instead of talking about the mistake of the Garcia knockdown they praise him for having an amazing chin
El garcia tira buenos puntazos ojo ahí eh 🇲🇽🇲🇽
Ryan Garcia got up and got the job done . I  like this young man , he is dedicated to his profession and i am happy for him .
Garcia is flatfooted. Easy target for the likes of Tank and Pac.
Yes I’m this nosy
Y do they call it a knock out instead of a knock down🤨
fair trade
A lo que a llegado el boxeo a este chavito si le dan publicidad de marketing pero si le pones un paquiado que ya va de salida lo deja sin dientes en el rin solo es marketing porque no acepta una verdadera pelea como con un ggg hahaha verdad que es muy diferente a estar peleando con batillos de cara bonita nomas  asco a lo que a llegado el boxeo donde están las noches mágicas de un paquiado vz dinamita marques esas si eran batallas en el rin,  lo único que tiene este batillo es dinero porque hoy si a lo descarado se nota que ya no hay pasión,  si no solo es dinero 💰 eso los mueve a estos batillos de cara bonita
And this is the kid that want to fight manny pacquiao?? Too early boii
That ribs attack was so perfect dude.
I want to see him vs Elvis Rodríguez
Beautiful handspeed by Garcia but lack of footwork and head movement.
Man you're too far to pacman
ryan garcıanın gerwanto davıs macında hıc sansı yok
Ryan not having his guard up when Luke is checking the jab is a red flag and if doesn’t learn from that he’ll get exposed by a fighter that has figured this out.
The boy has Mexican style in him.
He was used to just extend his arms and fade backwards when his opponent is throwing.  It's an effective defense, but unfortunately he forgot Luke has long arms as well.
i dont see garcia last 3 rounds with pacquiao. he's too slow
I’ve gotten punched in the ribs by my brother and I couldn’t breath for a straight minute 😂
I wanna see Ryan Garcia VS Connor Mcgregor
So this is ryan garcia the guy who wanted to fight Manny Pacquiao. Flat footed. Manny will make him sleep
Oscar de la Hoya en su mejor momento.✔️🤔
So this is the guy whos challenging pacman huh
Nice 👍
Ryan’s punches look much slower in the ring than on IG
Flat footed. Front foot is out of position. Doesn't circle outside. Soft chin. Pacquiao will slay this kid.
Finishing body shot
Mas allá de haber ganado esta pelea, Ryan Garcia demostró ser uno mas del montón, es un boxeador desprolijo, técnicamente flojo (con leves mejoras), quijada floja y sin poder de KO, podríamos decir que tiene Hype pero sabemos que eso  no sirve de mucho en este deporte mas que para hacer dinero. Yo lamento que los fans lo sigan con demasiado entusiasmo pero ni siquiera puede con un sparring de nivel mediocre (sino busquen Sparring Ryan Garcia). Le queda mucho por recorrer antes de llegar a Gervonta, si no quiere terminar su carrera de manera abrupta le recomendaría que no lo enfrente, está a años luz del nivel de Davis. LAMENTABLEMENTE. Ah! y fue el primer boxeador de nivel contra el que peleo, y casi lo nokea (bue...nivel... uno ahi mas o menos, a quien no le dio el cardio, en el round 3 ya estaba cansado como si fuese el 11)
garcia want pacquiao? the kid wants to die! hahaha..
flicker jab
Y’all really gonna sit and say that Ryan could take tank power if that was tank right hand to land clean like that on Garcia he wouldn’t be able to get up. And if he does he get stopped.
ryan garcia.. offense:88% deffense: 10%
prove how fast you punch when pacman is your opponent in the ring. bradley will just laugh at you if you don't do your quick punch.
boring fyt....less head movement less footwork...hahaha
Left hook to the body: is there a more effective punch, after the jab?
Ryan garcia bkl di gilas klo mlwan davis
Luke messed up for not pressing after that nice ko
@ 7:09 You see Campbell land a nice sounding body shot on Garcia before he pulls away, and Garcia TKO’s him with the same body hook. Give em a taste of their own medicine
pacquiao will destroy this kid
I love it
He got knocked down by something than can easily be fixed, always keep your hands up! He'll improve no doubt.
garcia vs pacquiao really lol
Very entertaining fight. GARCIA RULES
Drug money gives you power
Este es un paquete creado
Wboy throws noythun... The 2, and he's Lefty.  Smh.
I think naoya inoue is the best match for ryan garcia. :)
Fast hands slow defense
THEN THIS IS THE YOUNG CHILD YOU WOULD LOVE TO FITH TO A LEGENDAY PACMAN PACQIUAO,, .???.. COME ON.. LOOK AT THE FOOTWORK. 🤣🤣🤣 ...
Who else wasn’t expecting Ryan to get knocked down like that? 😳
Is this the kid who will fight pacquiao
Ryan Garcias a beast!
That kidney shot, made him  bow down
Garcia never lose
Ito yung lalaban kay pacquiao?😆
Is this the same guy who challenge PACMAN? lol
Kimg ryan win by body shot
Dreaming to fight MP is just a dream for garcia hes way to far to reach MP!!!if he like to retire early he should fight inoue
When tank connects its over for that boy
POOR RYAN,, F YOU FIGHT PACMAN 🤣😀
i wish i had the chance to become a boxer. But my ma aint supportive for shi.
Idiot Ryan at 2nd round knockout by left hook 1-2 punch's only, now you want pacman? Brainless boxer ever! Losser
Fast hands but flat footed. Not enuf.
Nice K.O in Round 1..whahhaa very happy.but u almost sleep in the cambass 😋😋😋😋👍👍👍but anyway congrats
RYAN IS N1 IN THE WORLD
A bit of a wake-up call for Ryan, and then showed us all why he is the legend he is. Awesome fight :)
Who will win manny or garcia?
what is​ this.
Хрустальная челюсть, 2 ой Амир хан!!
what f manny pacquiao fight to ryan hahahhaa
don’t ever compare this kid to floyd😂
Красавчик,после такого накаута продолжить бой ,ещё и выйграть,характер👍👍👍👍👍
3:26 and 4:41 that's a signature punch of manny pacquiao.
Another fixed fight for Ryan García but he’ll have a short career
The fight was over when Campbell turned his back. They are ignoring basic rules now.
Ryan garcia is not taller than 5’8
ЧЕРТ ЭТОТ ГАРСИЯ
Pacquiao will take this kid's soul out of him
How can u win over pacquiao my friend if u fight like that😂😂😂
Ryan did the classic amir khan 😂
Yeah ryan
Now imagine pac's left
Who let these kids fight like this
Bruh imagine manny throwing 2 hit combo right to the body and that over the top left how many lefts can ryan take from pacquiao
Is this the one challenging pacman?
I’d beat Ryan gervonta Haney and any mf at 130 135 140 bring the smoke
Слабый стал че то... .
Yes
When he hit cambell with that body shot you can see him say “okay”, once someone says that that’s enough. Haha
Gervonta es too much for ryan
Are you serious to challenge with Pacman? Mister Ryan Garcia????
I think ryan is ready for pacman🤣🤣🤣
Waow
Where is this can't believe there is a crowd.
You're flat footed and you swinf a lot.. Hope you dont do that to pacquiao.
And Campbell should have pressured him that why he lost
cambell a lil bit of a coward for turning his back
Wanna fight for the Filipino pride??? 😂😂😂😂😂
7:38. That ripple effect!!
Don't dream fighting Pac or else ur in big trouble!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
perta4ungan mantap
After watching this I remembered experience is important
Fake! Fixed fight! It seems like Campbell wants to apologize to Garcia and his corner for the knock down
This boy want to fight pacman.. Oh boy... Pity
2:37 thats why u came for
And you say you ready for mr. Davis like E-40 say NOPE...
shame that Campbell didn't pick up his pace after that knockdown
The man that gave Garcia a lil reality check lol 😂
Paquiao or davis its a dangerous for Ryan at 2:37 like a signature punch paquiao and tank davis
Ryan garcia so high ambition to fight manny pacquiao... im sure he sleep
He took that left hook wide open and got knockdown. Luckily it was not Pacquiao's left hook😅😅😅
Walang magandang galaw c garcia kung itatapat kay pacquiao.ang galaw nya parang middle weight.kakain lng to ng kamao ni manny.
7:10 Luke gave Ryan a punch  to the body which probably made Ryan think ‘I’m gonna get you right back’ ..
Satisfying to watch when garcia almost knocked out haaha
my guy...you are not ready for tank the little glass chin of yours cracked a little bit off a nobody...now... if tank got a hold of that same chin the way homie did boyyyyyy they gonna have to scoot a icu  patient out the way playa cuz you gonna need some serious attention if tank lays paws on ya jusssssssss sayin 🤷🏻‍♂️
Choosing manny pacman as his next opponent will be ryan garcia's biggest mistake.. he may be a strong puncher but his jaw is made of glass so fragile for manny...
The sour opera temporarily unite because gymnast cranially grin after a lively christopher. blue, smart believe
Ryan Garcia should fight JonFer from Spain.
just like the guy  said  ,    thats how Oscar de la Joya got knocked out by  Bernard Hopkins one the Nastiest BODY SHOTS!!! Great fight by both!!!
I didnt look painfull but it was a liver shot tho
hindi ka pa uubra kay pakyaw,  marami ka pa kakainin na bigas
Todo meco wuey el Ryan
I like Ryan Garcia but would like to see him be humbled.
Everyone seems to forget that Ryan’s only 22 he has 15 years if not more
Mistake of campbell is he ddnt grab his opportunity😊
el mismo golpe de Canelo Alvarez
Fixed fight
Gancho a la zona hepatica brutal, le destrozo el hígado, ese inglés orino sangre 10 días con semejante putazo. El sello de todo boxeador mexicano el gancho al hígado. Ryan García le sufrió pero  se Recuperó y ganó bien.
Ay lo creen  jajaja
There is no chance when you fight like coward or lady no talent boxer
Compell to scare to fight with graica
02:39
ryan garcia is a joke and now you want to fight manny pacquaio HAHAHA i think if manny is the one hit you knock down im sure that you will not get back to your position
U
But respect for campbell tho he successfully knock down ryan AND can handle the body shot he is just on his knees respect ✊
RYAN GARCIA AND HIS SPARRING PARTNER IS COULD BE AMAZING FIGHT....
ese golpe le entro como una puñalada
That body shot created some crazy ripples...looks painful
And jake thinks he can take him 🤣🤣
Alright !
This was better then Mike tyson V Rodney jones
How is campbell taller than Ryan and only 5'9???
Fake figth...
Ryan is overrated
*Впервые вижу чтобы Гарсию отправили накаут*
Ryan Garcia is only 61 kg? Really? Help!
You wanna fight my man Pacquiao with that style. . . Bro you'll gonna be a standing target
Garcia aint gonna win Pacqiao with that style and power
Ryan Garcia well never be ready for gervonta davis 😂
Ryan have to train his neck
Are they actually fast or this video is speeds up?
He will get down. There won't be another Money
Haha Garcia practice to actual..vs manny.?..
And he want to fight manny paquiao😂😂😂
Got knocked out by a no namer and you want gervonta Davis. Crawl before you walk first. Get some more fights under your boot. Get a better defense keep your hands up
7:32 viendo el canelo quien le va a romper toditita jajaja
Jesus loves you all
King Ryan #1
Всем Салам алейкум
Campbell was the clear, better fighter. It's unfortunate he got caught with that body shot.
You can't win Manny pacman  Ryan Garcia  You can't defeat our boxer from Philippines
Ryan needs to improve his defense and movement.  Flat-footed, running into punches, no head movement (reason why he got dropped), disregarding his guard when he punches... Don't get me wrong, I think he has a lot of potential but he is not quite there yet to be talking about fighting the big ones like Pacquiao and Teo López.
this kid wants manny ? 3:39 manny will TKO him there ..
Dito ka sa akin hindi mo ako kilala lalabanin kita ng bagay sayo ..your not a king.
The American commentary was absolutely shocking! Completely brown nosing Garcia. It was embarrassing!
You want to fight manny pacquao just liked that you kiss in the floor ha ha ha
Never mess to a lefthanded puncher
El pac-man así como esta de viejo lo va hacer pasar muy mala noche .... ese pinché lepe siente q se come la lumbre a puños...
What a bomb to the body.
🥊 Great showing from two great fighters. Congrats to Garcia. 🙂
Absolutely rattled his ribcage. You can see the wave of destruction ripple across him man.
Garcia is still young for Manny..if he fight Pacman his career will end..
PREPARE FOR PACQUIAO KID
IMAGINE PACQUIAO CAN DO THAT TOO EVEN MORE STRONGER
11 million views, it's because of Ryan Garcia,
Why’s no one talking bout how Ryan got straight back up though🤔
garcia doesn't have footwork, pacquiao will knock this kid out
If I was a boxing promoter I would match up Ryan Garcia with Jeff Horn
Unfortunately Campbell has always been overrated. Garcia is there for the taking.
He has some stuff to learn I know. He's a great boxer can't take that from the kid
They need to bulk up
TANK vs GARCIA 👈🏾
Brad ko toi avec Davis
i think not something special of ryan garcia. maybe the next he will try to make his skill more brilliants. di usia muda begitu saya rasa kemampuan vernando vargas ato erick morales lebih mumpuni. perlu kerja keras si garcia tuk mengembangkan kemampuannya agar menarik ditonton.
Medioker player were boxing..😂
his moves obviously he's trying to copy manny pacquiao but kid you need to fight class a fighters or world champions before you want to fight manny
This dude is afraid to tank
ryan is a brawl. this is manny wont goodluck boy?
Смотрю  ток тяжей. Но РЕШИЛ ПОСМОТРЕТЬ, ЧТО ЗА МАЛЕЦ, красивое окончание боя, красаво(быстрые руки дикого запада)
Ryan Garcia super
Ryan, Gervonta, Teofimo. All of them will break the jaw with Pitbull Cruz. Save my comment.
hindi kagalingan si garcia kumpara ky pacquiao.tactics,strategy of fight wala malayo.
Matthew 3:2 .
Repent Jesus Christ is coming soon .
Props to Campbell for even trying to stand back up but there’s no way he would have survived the round even if he did stand. Devastating shot!
My heart dropped when Ryan Garcia, got knocked out 😅
Amateurs
seriously? wont stand a chance to manny pacman.
Before you dream Manny Pacquiao .just imagine how manny he beat margarito,cotto,delahoya ,Barrera and Thurman. you might fight casemiro first  Ryan Garcia.
I'm 15 years old  and 62 kg , Ryan garcia is 61,235 kg  and I dont have big body so, how is that possible..
Feels like he won a world title HAHAHAH
Too slow for Manny Pacquiao.
his ego got hurt for a while..
Credit to Campbell teaching Garcia to use his Guard ..
down goes ryan garcia he is fighting someone that looks like an amateur and he wants to fight pacman, lol
Cambepell vs isac "pitbul"
Then you want to fight manny?
i would watch pay per view kingry vs. innoue
When the commentator was talking about their footwork I was watching their feet and missed the knock down so I had to replay it
Quality of fighters nowadays keep on getting lower. Old Pacman can demolish these guys,let alone young Pacman. Just compare the footwork. It's just hype and money. But I don't care about that when it comes to Pacman. He has already given away almost HALF of his net worth already.
Campbell is a Greta fighter
Melhor Luta Q Já Vi ...Fiquei Eufórico Com Esse Combate E O Desfecho Dessa Luta Foi Muito Bom ...Nocaute Em Linha De Cintura
He hit him that liver
Garcia needs to improve his defence, he was 100% going to get knocked down at least once with his head that open.
Garcia will be a punching bag for Pacqioa!...
These commentators were so awful
No more than European level Luke
Directo al higado
yo her is soooooo strong
the commentators, the crowd, the ref and the promoters were all against campbell in this fight
Ryan won’t stand a chance with tank or Haney unless his defense gets better
Luke look surprised when he floored him lol
Hey DAZN, I know this is late, but do you put these matches somewhere to be viewed?
Fake end
Like👍
2:36 ZUAHAHAHHAHAHA EASY
King ryan is King 👍
Ppl as usual focus on KD and KO, but the rest of the fight is actually more important in this case, it showed something never seen before, Garcia was clearly dominant, like no one did vs Campbell, neither Loma either Linarez... Garcia has a bright future ahead and not only because of the KO power. But if he fights Manny, Manny will eat him alive, one loss is not a big deal :)
Excited na akong makita siyang binubugbug ni manny hehehe
ANG ANGAS MO TALAGA RYAN
Teofimo then Pac-Man then tank then Haney
Ryan needs a little more defence
Boring. And you want to challenge pacman with that performance?
campell pudo noquearlo en el 2do round pero no quiso y eso le costo caro, Ryan tiene muchas cosas que mejorar
With that kinda awkward boxing style you think you can beat pacman?...Over hyped, too young and too ambitious bruhh😁 damo ka pa sin kakaunon na bugas na hayop ka
Garsia che leader
When you shouldn't sneek im that body shot
This garcia kid is a joke..
Garcia need to watch the Salvador Sanchez fights to learn about the defense and throw boxing punches. Salvador was the best in his division.
This commentation was dog water.
Ryan got a lot to improve. Those body shot is lethal, reminds me off another star Naoya Inoue.
boxing is dirt, it’s like pillow fighting
7:56
7:30
Garcia gonna lose to tank teofimo Haney
Kingry is a beast but needs to stop being over confident
if pacquiao land that kind of punch. wen u wake up ul notice that ur in the hospital.
I hope garcia will improve his footwork, he has enough power, hand speed and stamina to knock every guy out, but his footwork is so sloppy, he will be a beast if he improves his footwork
Campbell fights like a amateur.  This proves loma needs to fight no higher than 130 pounds. Campbell is trash.  Ryan is really fast and has some power but makes a lot of mistakes. If he fights Lopez he getting knocked out.
ryan vs canelo???  I bet on Ryan.
2:39 BEAUTIFUL 😂
Body shot of the year. Possibly body shot  of the century
The most annoying thing from this fight was that the crowd was booing campbell as he came to the ring, there should be respect to each fighter for even going into the ring
Glad to see garcia get the dub against his best opponent yet hes gonna be a killer real soon
Hopes that Ryan waits at least 2 years to go against Gervonta, he is not ready for him yet... We know he can hit quick and powerful, but we need more defensive technique from him,; you can “tank” a shot from Campbell like he did, costing him only a knock down... But the same shot from Gervonta is an instant KO...
Ganyan galaw mo garcia tapus labanan mo c pacquiao utot,pera Lang habol mo, hindi ka oobra Kay pacquiao 😜😜😜
He finish it with canelo's style..
tank will be sleeping on the canvass once he was hit by that. this kid got a deadly shot
nice one body shot.. blow by..
campbell face is not happy because he accidentally KOed garcia, he is supppose to lose the fight
what  the heck is this campbell sell the fight ,     garcia will get destroyed in real fight
Fixed
7:30 😎😎
Luke was winnin till the Ko.
His chin is his biggest flaw
7:13 liver shooot
Body shot challange anyody ?
What a fight Garcia is class 👏
at 22 canelo was fighting floyd.
Lemot no strong, Pockman the best
Look at how he throws that body shot he was wide wide open if he punche like that ryan will eat manny's right hook roll over, this fight will look like algieri vs pacman
What a fight.....
Luke would've have won if he wasn't paid off to not put pressure after knock down
Garcia vs Pacquiao what can you say?
King lying garcia
What a fight
Seguido metía a la conversación a Ryan García aplaudiendo su carrera, pero ahora aparece por todos lados con esa ridícula corona, me pasa lo contrario, ni siquiera lo menciono, me dá pena ajena, se vé muy infantil, o tal.vez cree que está en un ring de lucha libre. Qué lástima.
I can't wait to see him get up after tank puts him down lol 😆 😂 😅
Glass chin just like Amir Khan!!!!
Boy has heart and skills. But he might be a little too cocky for his fight record...I hope he hangs tough as he moves up in the caliber of fighter and improves his defense. He can dish it for sure...not convinced he can take it yet
What a dive, this guy was paid and this fight was set up. There trying to promote Garcia but this guy is garbage from what I see. I think that he should try running or something because apparently all he talks about and trys to showcase is speed. Last time I checked speed is only a fraction of the equation of being a dominant boxer also would recommend not running his mouth so much and having more accomplishments before trying to gloat. It only hurts you when you get humbled. Anyone who thinks this fight wasn't set up explain to me why the fighter didn't keep the pressure on Garcia right after knocking him down? I've never seen someone just casually let up on someone especially after knocking them down, that's when you got to turn it on and finish him.
Dmo pa Kya c pacman
And doesn’t anyone teach him some foot work?
And you’re gonna fight Pacman..? :-( please cancel it while you can.
That body shot was fookin excellent. He kept walking down Luke,and Luke kept ducking forward with 2 arms leaving his weak side open. Ryan feinted using legs for an upstairs shot but then sidestepped for a body. Wow.
Ayannn.. gusto mupang labanan C Manny Pacquiao, ehh durog kanga jan
Came here because he'll be Pacquiao's next opponent
pacman is watching and waiting
The one problem for Garcia was different gard from gambell
Ryan Garcia is the next Amir Khan
Quan qi ta legg
👉
Youre so slow bro i dont think u can toe to toe mannys speed, he will knock you at 4th round
Mexican body shots...
What if... If manny punches him like that!!! Oh boy!
Garcia speed?? Hahahahahahahahahahah
No footwork
Real deal is Tank.
Yo! IF YOU ARE A DEVIN HANEY FAN, THEN YOU ARE A STRAIGHT UP TRICK, DEVIN HANEY TRICKED YOU INTO THINKING LOMACHENKO DUCKED HIM WHEN IN ACTUALLY HANEY HAD NO LEGITIMATE CONTEST (all set ups) ON HIS FIGHT RECORD THEN AND HE STILL DOES NOW. Ha. No reason to fight someone with Haney resume, his “ title “ was earned through a vacancy. Teofimo was then and is now the better fighter. HANEY BEAT NOBODY FOR HIS “CHAMPION TITLE “ACCEPT IT!!      ppppssssssss ... hey., {SETUPS!}..for real though.
the fighting was in Dixie’ D amelios channel also
9:00
Ryan will try to do to Manny what Conor did to Aldo.
RYAN Garcia , if you want to fight Manny paquiao you  Developed your speed , your foot WALK, and your strong.  Low  speed didn't  prevail to pacquaio.
Garcia still too cocky even after getting dropped and yall know what happens to cocky fighters lol
So this is the guy who wants to fight Manny Pacquiao!!!!!🤔 Ok.  I think he mean in sparring 😂
That gut shot look brutal....dang bru ryan rlly did the drago punch from creed 2 lol
KEBANYAKAN GAYA
Luke Campbell expuso las debilidades de Ryan García, su falta de madurez boxística, deficiencia en la defensa ante un boxeador técnico, su vulnerabilidad en una combinación técnica y poderosa. Al final gana García, gracias a la pericia y buen consejo de su esquina; finta gancho arriba y lo descarga en corto a la zona hepática. Sin duda una estrategia digna de un campeón de ajedrez. Ambos peleadores demostraron muy buena hechura yo estaría al pendiente también de Campbell, creo que promete una buena carrera. Su estilo se me hace muy parecido a la escuela de Don Ignacio Beristain (Gimnasio Romanza).
Im16 and im a championship boxer and one day i faced ryan
We’re in Texas and it’s a western shootout
It is hard to breathing if you get punch or kick at your ribs
Man I cant believe he is so young  Against Pacman Im not sure about those punches.. Manny been taking overhand and powerful punches from  Mayweather,margarito or keith  He better improve his defense because manny can slip his left punch and do 1--2-1 combo that sometimes end up going down.  Though hes fast but he really need to train more with techniques and improve his defense.This man will probably become one of the legends.
PREDICTABLE JUST WATCH THE LEFT FOOT ITS ALWAYS FOLLOWED BY HIS LEFT HOOK.
With Canelo in his corner now, Garcias defence will improve dramatically.
Our Pacman will this kids face in a mess.
Ryan es buneo, Pero confía. Y trabaja mas En su Pegada,que en su defensa se descubre mucho en un area clave (La cara)
Who else is here because of Garcia KO
Oh man!!!! My pancreatitis just flared up looking at that know I’m saying.
Pacman is too much for him
7:38 liver punch?
Garcia doesn't have a chance to win against Manny Pacquiao, he doesn't ve enough defends. Pacquiao will Knock-out him with his fast deadly punches. I think Garcia is better to fight the next boxer with the same with his ages, he needs more many fights against such as Pacquiao, Golovkin.
That body shot was deadly
watch out pacman combination lol
Pacman goin murda that kid
Idk how I missed this fight but Ryan garcia called out the ko body shot in a video a few months ago
No chance vs manny :)
Cambell is paid actor here. 100%
Everyone talks about Ryan's speed but I dont see it
👎
Bato y         Atomy123
We can all agree that this felt like an anime fight like for example at the beginning he got knocked down then got up and in the 7th round gives him a body shot that made him go on his knees
If he wants to fight Manny, he needs to raise those gloves.
Tf was that defense he was wide open before that left hook
Whaaaat happen to you??
Imagine if that's pac left..
He is fast in training but slow in fight
Garcia just like a Amier Khan.. 😏😏 chin Glasses, you can't ever never beat the pac man
ryan garcia jan palang muntik ka na maknock out.kay pacquiao pa kaya.hindi ka uubra hahahahahaha
That's some crazy power, but he has to move  a lot more, or the elite will catch him and put him away. This type of defense will let Tank blow him up.
This kid will become A new lagend in WBC.superb skills
This kid is really strong and got speed, but that open chin gets me nervous especially with the level of competition in the lightweight division. They got some killers.
Mad nervous for Garcia Vs Pacquiao
Nice fight
He was open most of the time...
Ryan garcia  did a  body  shot
I would love to commentate and actually talk about the fight and not 2 guys who favor each fighter blabbering if I heard this on the radio like back in the day I’d have no idea what’s going on
That punch was so fake. Ryan should just Paciquiao is a bigger star. Ryan is just another soft.
Este payaso quiere fajar con Pacquiao  y ni te has peliado con gervonta
The dark organization analogously mourn because couch thermodynamically applaud without a long-term ship. workable, incredible eagle
If this kid's fight with pacman pushes through it's the first time i'll be worried for pacman..
Hola
That’s scary 22 has power not even loma and Linares could stop him and he has heart that’s hard to beat Ryan for sure will improve
This is not a top level fighter.
campbell threw this fight, golden boy money must be nice
the liver is a dangerous target
And he want to fight Our Pacquiao, you are delusional kid.
Hes an easy target for pacman  He doesnt have a body combination
He cant win against pacman
Ang layo pa nya.kung lalaban xia kay pakman.....wag kana muna kay pakyaw.sayang ka...
Always respect speed power of boxing.👍
atleast ryan has a balls calling manny than loma
Garcia's bodyshot challenge on tiktok really paid off
Ryan's feet are gonna  suffer vs Pacquiao he ain't moving his feet fast he has 0 defense. The only style that counters pacquiao is Floyd pure strategic defense. Ryan has offense i give him that but pacquiao'w offense is the pinnacle of Boxing prowess pure fast hands and feet overwhelming barrage no chance to take a breather
Ok so he hit luke in the liver
if luke turned his body with that punch it would have been his night. thats literally all he had to do
That body shot was so perfect
5:12 😐 7:29 he need to learn to be humble and should’ve been disciplined.
2:36
tank will end this mans career yeah go ahead and fight pacman
Hindi ito tatagal si GARCIA kay PACQUIAO hahaha.
No footwork.. this kid will be knocked out cold. If he face an elite boxer with some punching power.
And then he want to fight tank Davis bruhh!😂😂😂😂
Campbell of peaky blinders!
I came here because we have the same Last Names
Garcia was gone his opponent was scared
👍
Pacquiao via decision Pacquiao via TKO?  What do you think guys?
Who wins? Pacquiao vs Garcia
Manny pacquiao vs ryan garcia?🤔
DREAMS TURNING INTO NIGHTMARE
If Ryan Garcia wants to fight Manny Pacman I think Ryan Garcia wants to finish his courier🤣
I think he too young to fight manny
Si Garcia gabaan na sa ginoo tungod  mura nag kinsa murag hari na sa kalibutan🕆
This KID got a big heart. He's an aggressive boxer with tactical insight. He needs MORE than that if he wants to beat Pacman. He has a chance since Pacman is past his prime already.
7:39 that was a VICIOUS body shot. Campbell's body looked like a water-filled balloon.
Campbell turned all red after that body shot. Very impressive!!!
Hahahah garcia????? Like a paper
I think ryan will be a punching bag of pacman.
Garcia to Manny nahh don't do it kid have some future
He will get killed by pacquiao
FIGH GERVONTA DAVIS BEFORE AGAINST PACMAN
End of boxing career if you fight manny paquuao
The ref gave Luke up to five count and not give him an opportunity to regain his composure
El gancho de los campeones
Confirm if you here to watch how Ryan Garcia fight because he I’ll fight Manny Pacquiao. In my opinion García   He already lost to Many Pacquiao.
3:30
03:30
Ryan garcia vs Manny pacquiao I'm still waiting
7:38 beautiful
I think ryan will not stand toe to toe against manny so ryan needs to move smart in the ring when he start battling with pacman
Ryan gets hit very easily.  Needs more defense work and stop relying on offense all the time. And he is always flat on his feet.
If thats is ur move very lousy..u have no match for manny..
Ito ba yung nag hahamon kay pacman? Kawawang bata
He's just a kid, yeah he will dominate in his kind, the level of low and still improving fighters but not against pacman.
Nice
Pobrecito tiene quijada de Barbie jajajajaja y quería al Pacman lo mata
Pues no que era el nuevo ÍDOLO DEL BOXEO
Luke "my liver was never my friend" Campbell
The Kid Garcia is obviously TALENTED.
факт в том что дальше будет для него очень страшно)))
He fell like a character from family guy
все заметили! защита у Гарсии храмает . но порыв. мощь. скорость ))))
The wave of body shot... 😯
No wonder why theres a Pac Garcia rumours  because of this Pacman 1 2 punch combos
ryan goes down guard goes up XD
Needs more footwork to beat pacman..
Who came here after hearing Pacquiao may fight Ryan next?
not hating on Garcia, a great fighter in the making, but with that defense. Manny, is gonna slip a lot of punches on that face. Manny throws punches after punches, with no brakes and at the same time maintaining defense and foot work. If it's actually official that Manny and Ryan's fight is actually happening then i wish Ryan the best.
he wants the pac. ? what a shame!!!!
How’s he ment to beat manny pacquiao 😂
Future Amir Khan? 😂
Easy fight for pacman
I can't imagine how Ryan will end up againt Pacman. Hahaha.
So how is he supposed to beat Pacquiao again? Lol... this will be a easy work for pacman
I don't know if that boxing skills can match against manny Pacquiao's boxing skills
he has fight with pacman, he's to flatfooted for pacman. Pacquiao even at the age of 42 will destroy ryan. If luke Campbell can drop him imagine what pacman gonna do.
You want to fight manny?just think about your future first...😁😁😁
Looking forward to a great fight between garcia and our country's pride manny pacquiao.
Micky wards special
Who’s here  for Paquiao vs Garcia ?
Pac will make this boy sleep
Garcia is no Match for Tank, Tank will destroy him
Quien es el de México?
Pacquiao’s overhand left would demolish Ryan G.  Pacman’s attack comes from different angles Ryan G is going to be having a hard time keeping up with it.
covid is plandemic and scamdemic 🤦‍♀️
that bodyshot hurts even behind the monitor
That body shot tho😱
Ryan: I want to fight manny Manny's move 3:40😂😂
If this is how he (Garcia) fights Manny Pacquiao, then it's game over for him.
I guess Ryan's body shot challenge is effective.
Your too young and light for manny..
Here because Ryan will fight Pac 💪🏻
My favourite Ryan..gooo
I am back here because of his upcoming fight with the legend Manny Pacquiao! 🇵🇭
Luke hit Ryan with a cheap little body shot and you could tell Ryan was like oh ok body shot challenge it is.
ito ba lalaban kay manny whahahahahahha sigeeee wahahahaha
So this Kid wants manny..Goodluck
Pacman will knock out you
Pacquiao is going to take this guy to school.
mga ganyang galawan palang jusko wasak ka na kay pacquiao 😂
Arent liver shots illegal?
He gonna get caught with that left with pacman
Whos here bcoz of Pacquiao?
Wow!
Ryan García vs maní paquiao!!
Flat footed and his lead leg wasn’t on the outside the whole fight. I give gervonta 5 rounds and he’ll get Garcia outta here
Ready for Manny?
Mp vs garcia? Who you got?
Who is here after ryan garcia posted in his IG with manny pacquiao
Can prime Garcia beat past prime Pacquiao?
When I watch Ryan garcia fights, he reminds me of oscar de la hoya.
Esse pia é loko
ставьте лайк, кто смотрит в 2021 году. посмотрим сколько нас
When I saw that body shot and where it landed specifically, I knew that's game over. The Liver Shot is comparable to getting kicked right on the nuts. The only difference is that you can't breathe. That's the worst part about getting hit on the liver.
A solid hit to the liver will drop any man.
Ryan Garcia isn’t humble but nice body shot👌🏽
García needs a new corner... He is not there yet  This kids future is in trouble 🥊
No matter how tough you are who you are, you have no choice but to go down from a liver shot!
boxing hilig n husband, ang gwagwapo p ng mga player hehehheh...team bhadz
Mokhang Magandang Laban to Kay sir idol Pacquiao
Garcia needs to workout his footwork and lateral movement. Although he has an amazing hand speed however, body movement should be improve as well.
Kaya, kaya niya si manny?
I can’t see how people can watch this fight and genuinely believe Ryan Garcia is ready for Tank, Haney, or Lopez.
Ryan garcia will you fight pagara and see what you got...
And Jake Paul think he can knock out Ryan Garcia.
Campbell age 33 but his legs is 60!
Garcia is a banger for sure, but that chin is now questionable.  He has a long neck he needs to build on his shoulders to help sustain some future blows to his chin.
That body hit!
Wow
Still undefeated
Us garcia's always fight with the same style and pose how odd
How is he supposed to fight Gervonta If he had a hard time with Luke Campbell.
Ya quiero ver a ese Ryan García vs un peleador de verdad como Linares estoy seguro que tomará unas buenas clases de boxeo.
За лайкате что б американцы думали что я че то умное сказал
Look at the Ryan’s Garcia fans! Yes y’all’s golden boy got rocked with that one hit. Imagine if tank would of hit him like that.
Gran combate. ❤
SHEESSHH THAT BODY SHOT
I want a fight between ryan garcia and manny Pacquiao
Who willing to watch Pacquiao vs Garcia this 2021?
SHOUT out RODERICK DELEON...
He need some MILK for the RIBS
If those punch from tank.ryan will getting sleep
That was a sick body shot 🔥🔥🔥
Ryan
Who ever made the thumbnail should get fire
I wonder if Ryan still wants to fight manny pacquiao.. his too overconfident,
its a loose then miracle happened.
Отличный бой !!! Но мне кажется в России есть бойцы способные создать им достойную конкуренцию !!! Как вам ??? А вы ,что думаете ???
Síguele creyéndote insanable ryan  Das pena como Chávez jr
I wish Campbell would’ve won
too slow for MP.😂
yan ang lakaban kay paquiao tamad gumalaw tapos bihira sumuntok, papapakin ka ni idol manny
Yo commenting at 10,999,000 views !!! 😮 Lets get it to 11 mill views guys !!!!
Garcia got dropped almost exactly like how maidana dropped broner
first time seeing garcia on the ground lol even for a sec lol
Garcia is just normal kid he doesn't look scary he's attack just common Manny pac man is the best
And they say Ryan Garcia all knockout is pure luck
When Garcia gets in the ring with Pacquiao then he'll realize he should've improve his fundamental movements. He is winning because he's yet to fight an opponent who can show him how his game is still far from the big stage.
Why tf campbell looks like he was about to cry?
Garcia Is TRASH
GARCIA  do you feel when down?
Luke Campbell Needs a right hook in his bag of tricks!
You call this boxing?
Both these fighters overrated in my eyes!!!
If it wasn't for that knockdown this would of been a perfect performance from ryan
glass chin😂
tapus  lalaban  kapa  kay  pacman AHHAHAHA
Organ crusher Garcia
If tank lands an overhand like that on Ryan it's 90% probability that it's over!!!
Sa tingin ko Kung pinoy yan pinaulanan ng suntok pagkatpos tumayo Ryan.kaso wla eh hindi  tinapos agad campbell..
If Luke would’ve pressed him after the knockdown this fight would’ve prolly been over
No break with tank ✌🏾
GARCIA IS AN IDIOT HE WANTS TO FIGHT TANK DAVIS GO AHEAD GARCIA CUT YOUR CAREER SHORT NO CHIN
More experience added onto Ryan Garcia after this fight humbled him  Not to be over confident  He will have stronger and sharper  Mentality for his next fights  By staying more alert  Don’t blink🥊💨⚡️🔥 I will soon be beating these boys  Celal_thunder_ozturk  Future champ watch out🔥
Orale Garcia!!!!! You just passed the test! Way to go CHAMP!!!!
The real Miguel Diaz
That left hook in round 7 got Campbell down
GARCIA IS TERRIBLE BOXER.  HE HAS ONLY SPEED. THATS ALL .
but when you gonna fight my boy tank
better practice your footstep ryan your just like walking in the park lol😅...
ลุงพล
Awesome walk off from that body shot. Knew instantly that it did the trick
That punch even hurt me!
Tank Davis in 6.
Ryan do not fight tank
There’s no way jakes beating him
like ryan said dont blink
I don’t think he beat Gervonte Davis.
I can be delayed, but those internal organs screaming in agony require time to recover, ontop of that you cannot get your breath back, just gotta stay down.
Jesus Christ loves you so much!!!
Todavía le falta a la niña de García y no tiene buena quijada esta frio.
BRUH!!!⚡🕺🤯 @4:17
kaka wawain lang yan ni pacman hahahahaha walang magagawa yan si ryan garcia baka umiyak yan
I dont like ryan
Loma vs Garcia
Doroftei once said: a headshot makes you dizzy, cuts your feet and you go down. But in 2 seconds you're back up. A liver shot? That cuts your whole body off and you can't do nothing about it but stay down and suffer the pain.
Still not enough to beat Manny.🙂
man!! one of the best comeback punch! so fast and properly executed.
nka tikim ka dn noh rian garsia
Tank will destroy this kid
Ever been hit the ear? It hurts!!!
Ryan Garcia cannot start speaking about who destroyed boxing when he is the one ducking, diving and cherry-picking fights. The man is a acting like a coward period. Make the fight with Gervonta Davis and stop being a chicken.
Ended him with a body shot
Oscar dela hoya promoter wants to bring ryan garcia against the facman.I don't think it's time for garcia.he needs many more matches against the facman
Props to Ry on this 1💯
Garcia was off balance as he got hit which cause him to fall he didn’t get hurt he got up too quick lol
That knockdown was satisfying..
That 10 count was much quicker than the ten count fury had when he got up against wilder
Ryan garcia no match of many Pacquiao
dela hoya needs to teach garcia his bouncing in and out footwork , he's already nailed the power left to the head and body.
This guy really sead highlights when this is like the full right
Mad that this became DAZN’s most viewed vid in only two weeks
Garcea piyar👎, pfff!!! Uzbek taygers👊   Melikuziev, Shohjahon Ergashew, Isroil Madrimov, nambe wan
Definitely set up
Tank gone Beat Garcia to sleep 😴😂😂😂😂
Pelea comprada y pactada como todo del invento este de García
Pacquiao vs Garcia  1000% Pacquiao will win
Lethal liver shot
he said he is ready to fight manny.
To all those making fun of him for getting knocked down hear me out What did you expect him to do stay down? The most important thing is that he was able to get back up and keep fighting that knockdown is also going to help him improve a lot remember how much of a beast canelo became when he lost to mayweather that's because he was able to improve on his previous mistakes the same will go for Ryan Garcia
Cool hands threw everything. A great boxer
Kongo de pingers
this ryan garcia wants to fight manny? common kid
Orgullo mexicano!!!
Now THATS boxing
What a shot!  Garcia will only get better.
Up
Imagine if that was Manny's Left Cross..
Body shot vs body shot what a exchange!
I can see three were masked Mexican bandits in the audience.
3:40 bad chin.
this kid wants a shot at pacquiao just because he defeated a southpaw??? Too far, too early. smh
Yo when he gets angy, he really goes beast mode..
Yan Yong itatapat ky Pacquiao seconds Lang Yan wag ka Nang mangarap Marami kpang kakaining bigas wag Kang maghamon Sa veterano.uminom ka muna Nang gatas
Ryan works on his defense and he gets automatically better.
King Ry wants Paquiao like it’s going to be an easy fight for him? Face Gervonta first and protect your record lol
Lolol out loud. The things money will buy ya
Liver shot KO.
This man is a legend in the game
Que pelee con piofilo lopez
that body shot
Garcia can punch. but he lacks defense and he's flat footed. he's not ready for tank yet its too early.
Bring Eben back
Narrators!👎👎👎😝😡💩 💩 💩
Campbell no follow up thats the mistake.
Pre amir khan version for ryan
Muy buena pelea.
Fight first with Inoue of japan first....rather than Pacman
Linares vs garcia
Who's Campbell  ??
It Davis gets to touch him like that he ain't getting up until they start to clean the arena up
Viva la raza
Tank will destroy Garcia.
Every boxing match is amazing watch the classics
Garcia needs to tuck that chin and put his hands up. And when he throws combos return them back to his chin if not expect him getting knock out ...
Now he knows whats KD feels like😂
Se
Even I felt that body shot
I like Ryan alot but he shouldn't fight Pacquiao
Long way to go if wanna became legend
No mas costales ojala y este año puedan ponerle algo serio...
we want lomachenko vs garcia!
Ryan is the only challenge ive seen. I will box anyone without any training. Clench your jaw
I just hope that Ryan will get his lesson from all of this. He'll be a killer once he's learned to be agile enough and improve his defense. Rooting for him.
2:39
Garcia landed like a fucken gazelle 😂
Se están arañando 😂😂
The way Garcia fight, not a single chance he can beat paquiao.
He's still too far from pacquiao
Kings are Kings for a reason.
that body blow will take time to heal, believe me.
The big public got to know Ryan this year he should be in the ring magazine foty
How I wish Garcia rise in the era of Manny.
This Kid will be Great 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ryan Garcia is The Man!!!
And you want to fight pacquiao? Lol
This is what i wanted to see, Ryan  vs a real fighter, he proved himself now 💯💯
Am I the only one who thinks García MIGHT end up having the same career as Amir Khan. He is very fast and clearly hits hard but if he doesn’t sharp his defense he will get punched in the chin by a real puncher and eventually get badly hurt. He IS learning and getting better, I just don’t think he has the X factor to become a Canelo or Mayweather. I’ll be happy to be proven wrong, I don’t think it’ll be the case. I see Teofimo and Tank beating him.
If Luke was to keep at it after the knock down, Ryan would of got cornered during the last 40 secs of second round. Ryan was lost of what to do. Props for Ryan bouncing back and giving luke what he didn’t do to Ryan.
that liver shot was on pointtttt
Mucho trabajo de gym, mucha disciplina y mucha fuerza de Ryan García, pero cero talento natural.
Can you say liver damage?
Shuxjahon gartsiyani uric
Thats a manny pacquiao style.
Ganando con el sello de la casa 😎🇲🇽 golpe que le enseñó Canelo
Garcia got that body shot from Canelo.
The Instagram champion
Calling out MP to pass to him the torch? Hmmm. I have more questions than answers.
😀
who's here bcos ryan calling pacquiao? 🤣
Campbell had the first half, be canny if they would come back to a rematch
Liver shots ladies and gents, more painful than a knockout
Que pena o Campbell ter perdido essa luta... torci por ele, mas não deu.
imagine if pacquiao landed that kind of punch. this kid will woke up in hospital with 32 flying star dancing around  his head
this match? You clearly didn't watch it all
That left made his liver quiver.
Bata kpa pra hamonen c manny
If you get in Garcia's face an put it on him he is not all that! The next fighter to face Ryan should just get in his face let the Jab of because I'm telling you now that little brat from victorville is getting knocked sparked out soon enough he's not all that he's to cocky an he's going to pay the price soon enough! Campbell is average an nearly knocked him to sleep with a left hook
Ryan Garcia new Amir Khan
At list someone at this point knock out Ryan García
Campbell has a very odd style of boxing. Is he trying to confuse Ryan or he's always like that? Unorthodox
🔴😬IS IT ME OR LUKE CAMPBELL BOXING GLOVES DON'T LOOK VERY PATTED COMPARED TO RYAN GARCIA GLOVES 🔴😬😬😬😬🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🤣
I thought he was a goner after that hook... well played by the king!
Manny Paqcuaio next, as you wish Ryan Garcia. 🤓
now this is what boxing should be.
Lomachenko would clap Garcia with those flat feet lol
3:39 its like “Pacman One-two Combo”🤔
Canelo team predicted 7th round knockout
Just not ready for the tank's punch.
Garcia, another cocky boxer.
If you wish to fight pacman u gotta move that head.
the problem with the guy was not taking advantage of the knock down too passive
Cambell definitely skipped leg day
He wants to fight PACMAN?Well eat more STEAK & RICE maybe,that's wt makes Filipino CHAMPIONS!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Now Manny Pacquiao has a clue that Garcia is weak in his Chin.
di pa natalo tong ryan na to para tanggal yabang
Amazing ..... awesome I enjoyed it
This is what im talking about 👌 never mind them big knock out out punches... body shots are just as deadly  if not better i think... plus the body is a bigger target two get hit 🥊 if you cant breath you cant fight !!!
When Lopez lands on his chin like Campbell did I don’t think he’d be getting up.
why does this have 10m views
This is what happen if you let Ryan Garcia survive from knock down 🔥💯
I had to watch this at 0.25 because Ryan Garcia's punches where still to fast
Great job king Ry! Your bringing boxing back, got to have a outside boxing party like old times thank you
You see how fast that was!?! 😳
Tank will destroy ryan.
This guy should have kept the pressure on Ryan because he was still hurt. He's lucky he wasn't in the ring with a high quality boxer because it would've been lights out for Ryan. That's why Ryan need more fights before he even think about stepping in the ring with tank. And i heard the kid saying that he also want some of Pacquiao.
Wow super duper mantul cuy..
Wow... Body shot knockout is savage. Impressive!
Someone knock Ryan out already 🙄
Try The 8 division champion.
Why didn't Campbell follow up with the right when he was getting the knock down??
2:39
After that knock down and you wish to fight pacquaio? its too early for you when you feel manny punch.
Canelo cheering for Ryan lol
3:29
Liver.
Campell culo lo dejo recuperarse fue mi apreciacion
Campbell should have went after him after the knockdown! what was that?
Ryan better stop calking tank out. Whole different pace of fight and different punch level.
This was a sick fight,loved it
Not the biggest Ryan fan but dudes got it and respect for getting up and getting the dub. Dudes gonna do great things
If he can’t breathe he can’t fight
okay, that slowmo, that body shot ain't joke, that impact. What a perfect shot
Я
Did the commentator really compare Garcia to de la Hoya 😂😂😂6:06
Is this the kid going for pacquiao?
I wanna watch the match of Manny Pacquiao vs Ryan Garcia in the future
I've seen this body shot on Pac when he fights thurman the only difference thurman is so strong to handle that kind of pain
The liver shot!     From the other side! Stay humble
Great fight
Manny pacman in mexico
And Ryan calls out Pacquiao to pass the torch? No No Kid! movement and punches? Lol  You just want more fame and money lol
I think ryan garcia need to improve his footwork for boxing
*Match: Ryan won* *Thumbnail: Luke won*
This boy want to fight Pacquiao. Don’t rush yourself boy. You’re not in his level he might put you in early retirement if you insist that 🤣
Be humble bro for now you cant reach the level of pacquiao..think it your fame may fall..pacman will dismantle you easy as pie!
garcia recieve some left punch on his chin at 2:38 shocking punch at body on campbell  what more if he moves up to super lightweight, light welterweight.   then wanna fight pacquiao  big respect and humble to this two guys.
He want to fight pacman ?
👍👍👍
He want to fight manny after that ?
07:05!!!. Watch Campbell lead leg. He used to trick.
I'm just here coz I saw a post about garcia challenging pacquiao
If he is getting caught to that combination imagine manny throwing does combination and when manny throws that campbell combination manny will double it so how garcia can handle it its dangerous tho and manny have an amazing footwork unlike garcia
Boxing is really crazy. There are kids fighting grown as men out here
The friendly ambulance descriptively snow because november cephalometrically tame between a slimy millennium. silent, one enemy
im just here after i saw that ryan garcia wanna fight pacquiao.
No he can't knock Pacquiao with that movement . He's too slow
I came here cause I saw a post on facebook that he wants pacquiao to pass the torch to him🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
He asked for Pacquiao to pass the torch when he cant event handle 3:27, Pac does those a lot of times and even got to knock or rock out other great boxers.
2:37 This is what we’re waiting for
He down at 2nd round hahah then he want to fight with manny? Oh c'mon.
Campbell boxed amazingly that was a Canelo style bodyshot at the end top drop
Potek ubos hangin haha
Ryan's punches are impressive but he's too flat-footed. Not that it's necessarily always bad to be flat-footed, but in his case, yes. It's bad.
Ryan is going to get destroyed by Tank. I kinda feel bad. Garcia defense is so bad. Not even close to Tanks skills. He not ready.
Is a scam, like canelo vrs loma, dzn is paying for control , a real shame.
At 22, I would take my time and get more fights under my belt before going after the heavy hitters.  Move your career to fast can end a career before it even starts.
There's something about having no crowds at a fight that Ill really miss
Looks like someone skipped leg day
I like how Campbell is so humble n doesn't act like someone hes not
Tiene corazón el muchacho pero le falta mucho...
Isaac pitbull Cruz beats tank and ryan
"HE's Asking QueStioNS!!"
go go👻
The first nobody to knock him down I can’t imagine him going against a professional I mean this is amateur right?
Maybe Ryan vs Nikita abbiby two guys who never fought anyone
Wuonderfuul Garcia.
Next ryan vs GAYACHENKO
Tank would’ve knocked Ryan’s head off it he caught him with that shot
He needs to build up muscle, he's too skinny... Bulk up more Ryan...
The only thing flat for Ryan, it's the canvas. Hahahahahaahahahahahaha
I feel as if cambell felt sorry for the youngster when he put him down he didnt go at him afterwards. He should of finished him off. Lesson learnt for cambell because garcia was going for it after he dazed him later on in the fight and went at him.

2:36
The famous liver shot
This should show you all that he won't be able to beat tank
Dia tidak bisa lawan davis
Ryan is going to be one of the best boxers to eve live
So intense
you know what Campbell is missing? Heart. He doesn't want to take risks, he could have given his all when he put Garcia to the floor. But he didn't.
This lesson is about timing kills speed
Dayuummm...
the kid ryan garcia got a lucky hhahaaha but prop to campbell nice knock down to garcia hahah
How much more pacquiao could offer more lessons. 😄
Snatched him like a cobra! That was one of the most perfectly executed boxing move. He set it up, taunted him psychologically and deliver the blow like amazon on its best customer service's performance review.
The phobic iron fifthly dream because ball thermodynamically fear plus a boring card. purring, ad church
Gotta keep yo hands up brotha, got into a fight at school and hit this kid bare knuckle to his temple he was down for the count
Ryan is gonna stop Tank with a left hook to the temple. Mark my words.
rigged af, the guy in blue seems like he dosnt want to fight cmon bro
Lightweight stars of today. Garcia, Davis, Haney, Lopez..  I'll put my money on this guy.. Ryan Garcia. I Don't have money though hehe :)
This fight is bought
And Jake Paul thinks he can fight Ryan Jake almost died getting hit in the body with the pads Jake would die if Ryan hit him with that body shot
Interesting how when Campbell connected on Loma, never knocked him down, people said it exposed Loma. But, when Campbell knocks Garcia down people celebrate it as a sign of Garcia’s strength and willingness to fight back. Weird.
ryans a beast
Needed to alight book

Who's rewatching this after Ryan Garcia posted his YouTube originals 😂
Even though he won there’s a lot he still needs to improve on defense is one of em and not bringing his head that high let’s see how he looks in the upcoming fights
I knew every time lets go champ
What a punch 🥊
Ryan garcia estas imflado lleno de manzanilla .no te veo ganar. A Gervant .Al negrito
Por no corren .pasa esto
I really don't like Ryan attitude...
Down goes Ryan Garcia!!!!!!2:37 3:38 3:46
He hit him with the body shot challenge special
still no head movement from garcia
Juiced up just like alverez.
I believe Ryan got hit like that by Campbell so he wouldn’t get hit like that vs Tank
If left of manny hit ryan , it will be the end.
Respect to Campbell too.
7:38 😂😂😂😂😂 and the game comes to the end , 7 to 12 round, Mr Campbell you did what you could 👏
He cant win on manny and mayweather with a fighting style like this.
7:36 yo what’s with this celebration 😂
And ya think Garcia could be Davis? Lol
this kid, ryan, is so slow for pacman..
Dude that punch looked so dangerous play that at 0.25 and you could see HIS VEINS POPPING OUT, I am on Ryan Garcia’s team because I like him more, but I TBH feel bad Canelo because he got beaten by Ryan Garcia and Canelo is a champion I saw him and be TBH I feel bad for him GG for it
That was a nice liver shot. Looking from the impact, looked like it hurt alot.
Muito merecido Mano sou muito teu fã, tu é o melhor pra mim!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
What a lame win
Body shot was so effortless but beautiful
Peleon de los peleones de los peleleleones
When you take down a Mexican, finish him off, if you don't, they get up and finish you off.😬
Garcia defence so poor i think he in danger to davis.
Look at all these spam comments lol. Everything is fake about this kid, even the comments lol
Just simply amazing
this showed his chin im pretty sure garcia went back to the drawing board with canelo and got humbled...he would of lost if he let that knock down break his will
Check out complex boxings awesone breakdown of this fight
Both these fools skipped leg day
Tank's gonna get him. Ryan gets too trigger happy using his speed and leaves himself wide open. A counter hook by Tank and Garcia is gonna drop.
3:26  @abhishek bhai @ sai dekho
7:35 what is happening
You can't call yourself the king facing.  Old people.
Peliando viejitos no tepuedes llamar el king.
Idk if King Ryan is ready for Tank don't get me wrong I want him to win but my heart says Tank bodies him within 3 to 5 rounds what's your predictions?
Ryan ain’t ready for gervonta
Serves you right bud, take lessons from veteran
Pasa a la historia
Ap
very nice highlights. Both men fought well and that body shot was a fantastic clinical finish.
Man I rather get knocked out, then getting hit with a body shot 😳
Гарсиа красава епт  На характере вынес
Al chile no trae nada ese Ryan García ja ja
LUKE! You messed up! That was your fight from the knockdown to take.Didnt seem like you really wanted it😤😤😤😤😤😤I lost a lot of money on this fight ffs😤
Too flatfooted tank davis would demolish him for sure
7:38 holy f*ck brutal ...
5:42 He would go to the hospital if he started swinging like that at gervonta davis
Lo que sí es que ahí se va curtiendo el morro ... por qué de qué está puños lo está ... pero para mi fue suerte que ganara 🤔
He is struggling to fight the same height as his
The kid is  serious on offence, but his defence needs work
u wanna fight pacman but ur easily stunned by shots like that hahahahahahahahahahah
Ryan need more footwork, his hand is fast but foot still heavy
Ko
Is it me or its just many british boxers give up easily when they take punishments in the ring?🤔🤔...jamie conlan,Anthony joshua,amir khan,charlie Edwards..liam smith..and then this one...i don't know...
I guess all those body shot challenges that Ryan does are legit. That was vicious
this fight had me on my feet. Garcia look vulnerable after hitting the canvas. Cudos to both fighters for an amazing fight. Garcia is a the next Golden Boy if he keeps up his performances.
The problem was that Garcia is a T Fury Zombie and Campbell didnt Double Tap which lead to his demise.
Brooo Ryan has no defense doesn’t move his head or feet he just stands and throw punches
I would appreciate it if y’all checked out my channel I’m in Dallas Texas! Thank you!
If youbwatched the KO slow mo move carefully on the last part, you can see garcia used a deceptive/feint left hook to the body that made his opponent raise his guard up. Similar to which canelo uses because garcia also trained with him.
Gervonta noquea a Ryan.
Gervonta win to Garcia in two rounds
Campbell's decision not to go for the finish was a bad one.  He REALLY had Garcia stunned.  That was one of those perfect punches and i don't think there was any way Campbell would ever have gotten a decision, Garcia is too hyped.  He probably should have gone for it then and there.

Yeah probably a liver shot. Alcohol shot does less damage than that shot 👀 i think 🤔
Idk why Jake Paul is in ma head while watching this, I just wonder what would happen to him if he step in the ring with RyanKingG....
Coward boxer
nice puch
luke doesnt need canelo to knock ryan down.. image if hes train with canelo 😏
I can see two mistakes from Luke, he unguarded his stomach better if he used his footwork than just stand because staying away from the range of your opponent is better and he did not pressured Ryan. Ryan is weak if you are inside him. This could have been his win.
Pacquiao move
King Ry has a lot of work to do to really be ahead of his division. Footwork, head movement, defense. I’m a fan but there’s holes in his arsenal
7:38 is what y'all came here to see
Naoya inoue vs Ryan......who will win???
direct to the liver
lip-reading Campbell after the body shot: "OK, ow."
Don’t like Garcia
Ryan Gets Knocked Out 2:38  Luke Get Knocked Out 7:12
Ryan was like you body shot me now it’s your turn
Hermoso puño al hígado me recordó a Ippo
Mucha rapidez la de García tiene más aguante
Ryan gets too happy with just swinging and that’s gonna be his downfall against tank and plus he doesn’t have defense
Campbell shouldve finished garcia off. That was a real chance there but he lets garcia recover. Bad decision trying to play it safe.
No boxing 👎👎👎👎
Round 2 was the best !
Wn yo creía que iba a perder Jajaja, me estaba comiendo las uñas, GRANDIOSA PELEA, VUAMOS RYAAAAAAAAAAN
King Ryan..Got mad prob when he got knocked down
W
Beautiful boxing by Ryan. The left hook that Ryan dazed Campbell earlier was still on Campbell's mind. You can see here that Campbell perfectly defended against a left hook to the head. But Ryan mixed it up at the right moment and went to the body instead. Thanks to the great camera angle, even in real time that final shot looked nasty. Ryan kind of hopped into it. Wow.

finally a worthy opponent for ryan. luke managed avoid all of ryan’s powerful hook
This fight shouldn't even be getting that much attention or views honestly.
Nice job kid..but he would not survive The tank.Just my opinion
Y’all can’t hate on him for losing so you gotta settle for a knockdown 😂🙄
garcia is too open most of the times. idk if that’s his strategy or his style but against tank, he can’t do that too often or he might get dropped again
With what i saw, I don't think Ryan could beat Gervonta,  He ain't ready for Tank and maybe he will never be I want them to fight so Ryan realizes that he was wrong about Tank
Ryan garcia punchs like magnum pistol
Campbell punch knockdown vs Garcia was similar to the over hand hook that Marquez knockout on Pacquiao. Sheez that hook comes from blindside
2:38 everybody talking about Ryan’s body shot but this hit tho
Imagine if Luke was Jake Paul.  It would be sooooo satisfying to witness.
Oh and the best body shot I’ve seen he always comes back
Beautiful fight I thought golden boy was never going to go down ever but champions always get back up ✌️
Usually the ones from liverpool get dropped by the liver tap
He doesnt have a chance against davis, he cant move, he throws wild punches without moving, his legs are ages behind his arms
Awalnya mungkin anggap enteng. Akibatnya begitu.. byk petinju seperti itu. Contohnya pernah terjadi pada Lennox Lewis vs Hashim Rahman
Ryan Garcia Relies heavily on Reading Shots and Countering Strikes While Atacking Not much of a Defensive Fighter Needs His Arms Up alot more Throughout His Fights Needs to Work on his Defense Thats why He got Chin Checked and knocked down on the second round
If Pacquiao is out, this dude will be the next to bring excitement in the ring.. Support from the Philippines, go strive for greatness ryan
Come on ryan
That body shot was like a body shot of Vegeta SSJB to Golden Frieza
Garcia is terrible he was dropped by an uber eats driver
What a biggest comeback
The shots just look like it’s not bad but it’s because they punch so fast
I love how you can see when ryan gets knocked down campbell opens his mouth to gasp as if he's surprised
It could shut down He's liver from that punch
LETS GO RYAN GARCIA VS CANELA ALVAREZ
That body shot hurt me😂
Definitely not getting up from no tank hit like that
Commentator suckling Garcia's
So all those Garcia hits you with Body shots videos were real.  Jesus.
Lutassooo esse Ryan e pedreira....
May he be humbled enough to take care of his pregnant woman, instead of cheating with a girl who only just turned 18. Piece of trash in the making.
haha he deserves it 100%
That was like a Rockie nd creed fight lol
I think he can outclass Tank in that ring. Tank not as smart as him he’s just a brute, but Lawd Garcia better not let Tank catch him with that right uppercut. Lol.
You are the new Manny Pacquiao! Stay humble!
Garcia needs a better team Immediately
Ryan needs to leave canelo team alone an do his own thing or go wit tmt
What a fight. True champions the both of them.
That was for a belt? Maybe keep your front foot outside of his and eliminate that left by cracking Garcias body
They counted to 7 and ended the fight 😂
Chicken legs for days
Клас
Luke is a class act but he's just not got that killer instinct... It really is a shame he has so much potential. Maybe a different trainer would help. ?!?!?!?! Ryan has talent but he's really not a likeable personality.
And Jake Paul thinks he can take Ryan 😂😂
🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽 When you got the world’s best pound for pound standing and clapping at your performance you doing something right... Props to Ryan and Viva Mexico Cabrones!!!!
Gervonta Davis can beat Ryan Garcia
when they make a movie on ryan garcia in 30 years, this match is going down as his moment of realization to keep his guard up
Que pelea tan más falsa, Rien García
7:12 movie moment
GGG 👊🇰🇿🇰🇿🇰🇿🇰🇿🇰🇿🇰🇿🇰🇿🇰🇿
7:12
The style of Ryan Garcia is like the style of Amir Khan😆
His real challenge is tank
I think Garcia needs a few more fights before fighting Tank. He will definitely lose. who wanna bet..
Who's doubting his punching power now?
The mad thing about the elite level, you can look like an absolute merciless killer. You are already a proven great fighter.  Until you reach the top 5 guys and then you really find out if the person is a special type or not. Great fight 👏
Прекрасный бой! Райан Гарсия вне конкуренции👍👍👍👍👍👍
Garcia went super sayan after that 2nd round
2:39 NO
Mierda k feo boxea ese García no se emocionen mucho con ese k no ba lejos en esto
No hate to ryan he's speed and chin it's like amir khan
He cant afford to get caught with a punch from tank like that
What a terrific bodyshot
How long ago was the fight?
Es buen bixeador García. .pero se desvontrola cuando va perdiendo y pierde compostura cuando gana...le falta mucho para estar a un nivel excelente..
Most biased commentary ive ever heard
Campbell had no initiative,just stood there waiting for Garcia to move first. That's no way to fight a younger fighter who has speed and accuracy on his side, don't let him think ahead,he won't pardon and he didn't... just overwhelm him with hits and forward movement,dob give him time go use that youth. Lame fight for Campbell!!!
Clash of two chicks🤣
Ryan was having a hard time, got knocked down and proved his skills and limits hope to see a new and more powerful ryan in his next fight
Ryan is best
Tank is gonna destroy this kid smh ' he better off fighting Haney
you know ryan was getting cocky during that second round after landing a few of his hits in the 1 rounds on luke cuz he started lowering his guard, but after that one knock down, he started to take this a lot more seriously, great fight between them tho
Campbell blew it against Linares, was schooled by Loma and put Garcia down with an opportunity to end him and didn't take his opportunity. In my opinion Luke needs to retire as he is simply not world champion material, not even close.
Garcia was exposed. Devin Haney Will beat him easily right now.
What a hit! I felt that body shot through the TV!
I paniced so hard when garcia was knocked down
your not yet ready to fight pacman  you become an easy opponent of it if you wanted him
When u get hit in the liver u juat collapse no matter how strong or hard are you
I new Garcia would come on top well done 🙏
People cant give garcia the credit he deserves lol just because he got knocked down in the 2nd doesnt mean he was exposed lol the guy is 22 yrs or something, and luke campbell is an elite boxer... even lomachenko considers him championship lvl that body shot was beautiful
Luke Cambpell got robbed!
You know that punch to the liver hurt
Can anyone tell me what type of gloves that campbell using??
They say this dude Cambel is an Olympic champ? No way, I don believe it
The New Moha Ali l have never see a boxer who leaves so fast and keeps fighting!
The liver is the weak point...FACTS
Solamente suerte
everyone eventually meets their match either better or close
Keep your cool son, your in the big leagues now
Im a Garcia fan but glad he was humbled by that knockdown. He gonna learn and become a better and more mature fighter. Great fight, hats off to Luke
Gervonta Davis se lo RE FOLLA
Nice fight
That body shot was like a sonic boom with that torque, speed, power, precision and accuracy.
all the boxing pros in the comments talking about ryans form and how he leaves his face open... i dont think its about what he leaves open i think he just needs to work on his distancing right?
Yea was wide open for that knockout by Garcia...
tank davis will knocked out this two
Ryan lucky thats all, he was sloppy and looks immature in the ring. He not ready for tank or haney and even less Teofemo. He should go against vergil ortiz next.
What would we do without sports
Todavía le falta lona a García
Over rated Garcia 😂🤣 glass chin "
AWESOME job Luke Campbell !!! for sure Garcia learned something in that knocked out!
Ese ryan ya se le Subio lo pendejo
Latinos FTW like usual in sports!
all lefties are very Dangerous
If that punch came from tank Davis! It’s over for Garcia...
Yess like
IDGAF RYAN IS A REAL FIGHTER
VALEU MESMO,UMA GRANDE LUTA!!!
i think if tank davis punch that i dont know what happen to him
That's the same left hook shot to the liver by Canelo
Garcia definitely won’t be fighting Tank anytime soon after kissing the canvas like that.
ryan really needs to work on Defense... he might a amir khan in the future nonethless his chin is strong
Ryan stood tall through adversity. Dude got knocked and hopped up real quick. I thought Ryan G was just some lucky prettyboy, but he's rough for this one. 🥊
Pelea bien pero no es la eminencia que dicen. Aparte tiene trae mandíbula...ese es su talón de Aquiles...y pues ya toco la lona y eso cuenta mucho para el boxeo.
Now he realize he must polished his defense or else someone will put him to sleep ...
Ryan is the real deal. Campbell is the best opponent he has fought and he passed with flying colours.
Hope he knoks out mayweather boxer because if he don't he will lose because Floyd mayweather will win by points. Because he pays to win the fights by points.
7:08 Campell vs Ryan body shot
Did he wave goodbye?
Who's more delusional, Charlie Zelenoff or Donald Trump?
If Luke would've poured it on after he hurt Ryan, we might be looking at a different outcome. Great save by Ryan.
Ryan cant beat davies
Payaso
Fast hand with Knock out power but lack foot work. If he gets to fight a elite power puncher 1 clean shot might end the fight.
Clever lunge forward with the left hook kept high then drops down to the body
Glad to see the kid step up in comp and show heart. Props to him
One of the best fights I have seen in awhile
garcia isnt ready for tank similar to how canelo wasnt ready for mayweather when they fought.
Левша он и Гарсиа ПОДковал
Why did Ryan not counted when he was knocked out, ref made sure he held it up.
ı hate ryn
7:10 Campbell lands a body Shot on Garcia, Garcia gives him one right back and drops him. Nice shot.
Monstro
garcia wins but he's not ready to fight Davis.
Well ill tell you all something i am Mexican love my mexican boxers...but ama be really honest if ryan garcia fights like this against Gervonta Davis ill tell you what he aint gon last 2 or 3 rounds😂...cmon he got knocked out by luke campbell imagine what could Gervonta Davis do to him😂
Felicidades ryan eres muy bueno
О мозга арен жендингой копал
Canelo, the clone of floyd, imitates everything, you can tell he admires him a lot.
That was funny what the Comment said “ The flash got hit by a flash punch and that was nothing flash about that “ 😂
Princess Ryan has no footwork 😂😅
He give you
He not ready for Davis
Hizo un buen trabajo Luke,expuso las debilidades de Ryan...
Похож на любительский бокс  На профи что то не похоже
I like ryan Garcia but I love that he got knocked down...humble
Marcos maidana,and Arturo gatti survived this kind of shot!!
The garcia knockdown was pacman signiture body head combination, used to knock thurman also in 1st round
Garcia won't last against gervonta Davis he would get killed lol
Garcia Davis will be like Hearns and Hagler
Nunca avía mirado una pelea de García, por qué me parecía una persona altanera agrandada y presumida pero hoy mire este video y la verdad no pelea nada bien hay peleadores mas humildes que pelean mejor el!!!! A y que buen golpe le pusieron🤣🤣🤣
que pelea mas arreglada cuanto le pagarian a campbell para que perdiera?? el mentado Tank Davis le va arrancar la cabeza de un chingadazo.
YOHANAN(JOHN/JUAN) 14:6 "I AM THE WAY AND THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE. NO ONE COMES TO THE FATHER EXCEPT THROUGH ME" "YO SOY EL CAMINO Y LA VERDAD Y LA VIDA. NADIE VIENE AL PADRE SINO POR MI"......
Luke Campbell great fighter with great skills.  But unfortunately for him,he doesn't have the Character!
Definitivamente es mejor peleador Campbell, mas técnico y más box, pero desde el round 2 se canso, le faltó condición física.
Jejejejejejejejeje que farza la del Ryan a Davis no le dura 5
The left hook stepping back by Ryan that hurt Campbell reminds me of something Tommy Hearns used to do very effectively.
Chupapi munyanyo
Still below level with gervonta
the guy who won the fight was acting like a rat, did they all notice it?
The Views on this video speaks for itself, the Superstar Ryan Garcia is ... 🔥🔥🔥
great match
For Garcia knockdown experience with Campbell, its also reminds his boastfulness and being so over confident sometimes the way he react in front of the media press conference.
And down went the so called himself the king! And that’s just the beginning of you falling like a wimpy Deer Ryan...Tank is gonna knock you out! I hope this was a lesson taught of you trash talking! Peace out!!!
Now Ryan Garcia is ready to fight Gervonta Davis, the great exciting showdown soon.
he's too young for that kind of arrogant. wish he never experience a worst loss of his life. he need to stay humble
i love you🤧
Nakakatamad manood dihado tongc Campbell natatakot cya kya hindi nya ma bitawan yong job nya hindi nmn yan makuha sa power punch lng dapat ma set din yon job nya
Love to see an Arrogant fighter knocked down..
worst defense by his enemy
Lucky Garcia
NASTY BODY SHOT!!!!
teo or gervonta next
Tank 5”5 lol
Rocky balboa style 💪🏼
Great fight 👏 👌
Just wait till Tank lands a left on that chin.
No entiendo por que no fue a rematar cuando lo tumbó, y voltea a ver a un lado con miedo... miedo de que? Si casi lo noquea! Quizás se le pasó la mano y no era lo acordado? 😂🤣✌️ Estuvo buena la pelea pero tengo mis dudas ante el ataque tan pausado de Campbell 🤔😏
👍👍👏👏👏🔥🔥🔥🇰🇿
Guys, I get like real bad headache after every sparring match even if its light sparring or if I'm just taking 3 blows or something. Does anybody know what i can do about it?
Ow daffy duck commentating
Why'd garcia let go of his defense when there was a hook coming?
gervonta gonna lay him flat
Шикарный бой. Минус печень 😬
Niceee🔥
Lomachenko the best!
Congratulations Mi chingon  "Ryan García" Always Dando🥊🥊🥊 Buenas peleas 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🇲🇽🇺🇸
A rematch would be interesting
Great fight, I thought the commentary was really poor. Obviously different broadcasters have bias but it was disappointing that all they spoke about was Garcia on a fight of that level.
Ryan needs to work on defense asafp. Some brawler with a chin will put him to sleep for sure. I'm remembering how Maidana blasted Ortiz.
7:29 the lion has officially unleashed this was a movie fasho say what you want
OK Ryan is always a king but can we appreciate how Campbell took Ryan to 6 rounds he fought very well
Those kidney shots is not a joke.
And he wants to fight tank 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The white hope ended up being the white hype
7:04 he stepped on his foot to secure, then hit
weak vs weak
Campbell had him rocked and let him off like that ?
Русских нету что ли тут
Garcia takes one on the biter gets up,Campbell takes a body shot can’t get up...talk about power punch.
Mexican power
García no durara mucho tiempo en el box . Tiene quijada de mujer. Obviamente no sirve como boxeador
The condemned forest strangely marry because pajama substantively obtain apropos a rambunctious venezuela. dynamic, ritzy soy
And Garcia wants Pacquiao? You cant be    so lousy and no defense like that.
tank hits way more harder than Campbell!  ryan can't survive
Le metieron las manos a rayan teofimo o gervota si lo noquean
En hechos siertos le dieron la maldita 😂😂😂 pero muy buena pelea xD
You have no chance fighting Davis
Ryan you are the king 👑
chin not to strong yet .
Bad highlights, Rain was almost nothing in this fight. Luke even after covi was ok, but anyway in bad shape. So this is new boom from Oskar🤦
Ryan Garcia handicapped Campbell at the scale with rehydration clause and million dollar non-disclosure agreements, people open your eyes. Golden Boy boxers never fight fair.
Wow nice job luke onentime down shut win or lose
The Tank would've laid Garcia out cold with that left hook.
If ryan fights like this vs tank, he gonna get ko for sure
Jake Paul thinks he can beat this guy😂😂
That was a Liver blow
As soon as Cambell landed that shot, Garcia instantly has his guard up lol
Cambell skippin leg day
Güero okijyokixtikke.
Wat an asswhoopin
Humildad pa y serás mejor .
Fue una excelente pelea, donde ryan por primera vez lo mandaron a la lona la verdad que estuvo buena ojala haya revancha...
If you defeated lomachenco, leo sta Cruz, devin haney, teofimo Lopez and tank davis that's how you should celebrate. Who is campbell, anyway? As if you die fighting and celebrate at the top of your lungs. That's easy, mate. Sorry. Congratulations thought.
Man, why he celebrated like he killed a lion? In fact he just fought a lil cat. Ryan, you just defeated a simple ordinary boxer. That is not a tough fighter, mate.
Davis will be way to much for Garcia.
yeah😱
That knockdown combo of Luke is very effective!
Garcia, the new Amir Khan
Campbell hit him with a body shot of his own then Ryan Garcia showed him his version of a body shot ❤️ king stuff
Ryan needs to stop home training and focus on canelo's gym.
Apakah ada dari Indonesia disini
Apakah ada dari Indonesia disini
GRACIAS A CANELO ES LO QUE ES.
ryan is like a young pacquiao and devin is young floyd mayweather
He won’t get up from a tank Davis punch trust me
Campbell se quiso morir cuando tumbo a el trompas de puerco...pensó que su carrera había terminado...afortunadamente para el el trompas de puerco se levantó para poder noquearlo como habían quedado...😅😂🤣
Gervonta will ko Ryan for sure
2:35 und 7:10
Fights like a lion. Love that
I love this kid
That shot from Luke was incredible respect to him
dive
Mans got his liver blasted 😭😂ain’t coming back from one of those
my jaw dropped immediately when ryan got knocked
Garcia drops both his hands when throwing hard punches
actually when i saw this. i realized that between the two only too much power ryan garcia had. luke in skill,footwork and counter is much better than him. but luke can't do nothing to ryan, because even ryan barely missing he looks like being hit by truck. i wonder if ryan is as skill of crawford,espence, canelo, i think no one can beat ryan. too much speed on his hands are present and too much power, the skill of dodging and footwork, head Movement are sadly to say has nothing at all.
When Ryan got dropped for the first time, I was like HOLY S**T, HE GOT KNOCKED OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME! that really shocked me. Until garcia give Campbell a vicious body shot that broke his ribs. Man that was a savage fight.
everyone kept saying lets wait to see what happens when he faces a real fighter or gets knocked down, will he win? here you go
A punch like that would’ve sent me to Thurnesday.
I think someone made a lot of money because of the awkward KO.  I didn't admire Luke's defense specially when he started taking shot - showing back to duck the shots-   Congrats to Ryan.
Great come back García.... Tank Davis is next
That early knockdown, regardless of how easily he went down, will most likely be the defining moment in his career.   As they say, ‘everyone’s got a plan till they get hit in the face’ and credit to him, he stuck to his guns. He may not be a great, but he’s more than just a hype train
he not ready for Davis
García peleó con un muerto 😁
3:29
3:28 this man's face went from 👁️👄👁️   👄👃👁️
.“Jesus understands your worries and hurts, and he wants to lift those burdens from your shoulders”
Well done luke,, flying the flag for HULL 👌
Soy mexicano pero la neta García no está para pelear contra teofino está en otro nivel
Congrats on your win man you did it
The terrible  commentary ruined the fight for me. Great fight still
Cayó igualito que el Andy con el bracito  hacia tras y se levanto igual a ganar.
Ryan’s gotta work on defense if he wants to beat tank
Garcia not that great of a  defender, won't beat an elite lightingweight fighting like this.
Cool knockdown by Luke!
Ry is lil weaker than i expected... Get more Practice, Power, Speed and tecnique before you Mess with Any of the Filipino fighter....
I’ve never seen somebody drop like that from a body shot
Garsia vs Giyasov Shakhram!
Ryan Stands no chance against Tank
García está verde todavía le falta. Un boxeador bueno lo hubiera noqueado.
Congratulations to him. Hopefully, he doesn't become an egotistical monster so full of himself no one can stand his company because he takes himself way too seriously.
Kid has more pwr than I gave him credit for... Footwork needs a little work. Mighta been okay for this fight, but someone who can instantly switch the momentum on him is gunna really challenge him in keeping his composure when suddenly having to switch to fighting off the back foot going backwards. Too many times his feet where fully committed to his offensive action and he just lucky Luke was busy trying to make adjustments for Ryans unexpected timing and  pwr.  Got much more sloppy as rnds went on too.  Haney could well use angles mixed with lateral movement to expose Ryan’s weakness in this area.   That lead hook of Ryan’s tho.... Very nice. U can tell when he wants to use it. His lead foot is way turned in.  Just seen Luke expose him for it with a knock down. That hook landed square from the angle that Ryans feet where both perfectly perpendicular too. Like getting caught with your feet side by side....
Campbell will forever rue not testing Garcia's legs a bit better after that knockdown. Garcia did exactly that at the beginning of the 6th.
Garcia speed, images how this guy makes HJ's.. Crazy... 😵🚀
This was a fantastic fight for both fighters, real boxing. I enjoyed reacting to it.
Ryan Garcia is nowhere near calling himself the Next Big Thing. He has serious holes in his defense. He makes me think of Amir Khan when he fights.
I get it but could the poeple cheering shut up for a sec
too close boy
That young mans left hook will change your life
Wow Ryan Garcia really proved me wrong after the time Ryan was knocked out
Cant get into Ryan Garcia lol, watched some fights but idk he alright though but something bout him i find dislikeable.
Hes going to be more humble after getting knocked like that
If tanks hits him like campbell did, then he aint ever getting up😂😂
Quá đỉnh
K now go watch the Lopez vs Loma fight highlights a d you'll see the difference in level
if that puch is thrown by tank david. garcia will go night night
Everyone talking about Ryan got knockdown like if de la Hoya didn't get knockdown early in his career and came back to knock them out or Mikey Garcia ,what about porter, hearns ,Ali who all got dropped and got up to win.  Yall need to learn more about boxing history.
but still your  footwork is slow  ....you cant hit manny pacqiao  if  you move  like  that ...
THE FIRST 2 PIECE FROM RYAN WAS QUICK
Garcia uses cobra punching bag very well. His head movement during training with that cobra bag is great. But during actual fight, his head movement and foot work are poor. But he's still learning, not taking anything away from him. He is a threat now to other elite and I think they need to fight Garcia now seeing that his foot work and head movement are poor because once he improves those mistakes it'll be harder for them to beat Garcia.
jake paul and logan paul boxers🤣🤣🤣
No tiene cintura ni cabezea poco futuro
kayabangan ni garcia..bagsak tuloy...hahahahahahah
IT LOOKS PAID
Davin Haney will destroy Garcia🤣
very evan match up ,like to see this fight again ,respect to both
WHAT A BODY SHOT
I’m not impressed by your performance. Gervonta Davis eats Ryan Garcia for breakfast 🍳 🍳🍳🍳🍳🍳🍳
2:36 crazyy punch
Hope he fights davis
Not yet, the power is there but overall still little raw...
Entertaining fight, Garcia showing serious chin is a huge plus in his column.  The body shot was almost certainly a fight ender, and was spectacular no question, but I wish the ref didn't double time the count, that was no where near 10 seconds.
Garcia is massively overated. If Campbell had some killer instinct would of won in three rounds
Nothing special. Overrated.
LET'S GOOOOOO!!!!!
Ryan Garcia he showed a lot of heart,in that fight, but he can't see Tank.
i must admit Ryan Garcia is a pretty clinical, explosive puncher i see him giving Tank big problems. especially with his hight and reach over tank.

La mayor farsa del boxeo, Ryan Garcia.
Canelo style xd
White boys boxing 🗑🤮
"Buen" gancho
I'm not impressed
no way Garcia cud beat Tank
great fight ,got to give respect to both guys ,but that last shot was perfect 👍
It look very painfull almost thought it was ufc 2 or 3 😂😂, but i think that with all the name he is getting to himself the ego, selfish and cockyness are starting to show up in him, but thats just my thoughts what do u people think?
wow ryan got hit real hard suprised he got up
I’ve been hit like that ! Shot is no joke hard to bounce back
ryan glass chin garcia
The dramatic albatross ectrodactyly exercise because passive hopefully stay a a married pamphlet. profuse, aware taste
....looks a lil suspicious 🤷🏾‍♂️
this is not the guy who boxed against Loma and Linares) Сampbell was a pale shadow of himself
Garcia looks like one of those arrogant kids who's gonna get a hiding vs the very top opposition. I'll give him a couple of years until he's looking for a new career.
Just dont feed em to tank just yet
Goku le gana
His defense is absolutely not ready for Tank.
How do they both look 16
Ryan is doing ok but he still needs to work much more in order to fight Gervonta, he (Ryan) has to really put a lot of work to win the fight vs Gervonta, Gervonta has a lot of punch power, speed, witts, guts and balls, Gervonta is a beast.
Nice
I felt that body shot.
Davis will eat him alive...
Casi le gana el fofo mqz
his trunk really says "king" ?¿ i hate people like that
The slo mo shoes the impact of that body shot
Big pay day for Luke to let this kid build up is resume
5 days and almost 10mils view. Ryan has  start power.
mames que putazo, yo hubiera vomitado sangre y desmayado del dolor por ese golpe al hígado
Insane fight
Way to represent the High Desert California!!!
7:38 that's cleeaaan! 😖💢
Off topic but Who else thinks Ryan looks like  Angel from gugu  Foods
im just waiting the time ryan face a real boxer
The way Garcia closed the distance so fast like a blitz cant be seen without 0.25 speed then you can see the beauty of his footsteps and that shockwave on the body
Ryan Garcia, The Comeback kid. Great fight.
Manny Pacquiao combo body shots then followed by solid punch in the head.  Boom, knockdown!
Ryan Garcia sure knows how to attract crowds
Ryan garcia became a cocky fighter as time pass..
I want to watch the whole fight. Athleticism at its finest
Garcia has potential
Hahahahah that's what I said..you need that shock
No soy experto en boxeo, pero siempre me da la impresión de que garcia pelea muy erguido, por lo que pareciera que en cualquier momento puede llegarle un golpe como el del segundo round.
Garcia reminds me of Amir Khan. Flat footed, high chin, super fast hands, and a 'live fast, die young attitude'. This was a Amir Khan vs Marcos Maidana, fight ending body shot.  But Luke Campbell is no Maidana. Garcia won, but....was exposed, he is   vulnerable. He needs to be more Mayweather, than De La Hoya, going forward.
Tank will destroy Garcia
Tank will Knock Garcia out GUARANTEED... he's to flat footed, he will get counter punched easily with those long punches, he has no chin and he's slower
I want see this King vs  one of top 5 of his weight
Not about how cool you look or how fast your are always told people somebody can really hurt him he hasn’t fought anyone
Coaches: keep your hands up Audiences: Ryan shouldve done a jab cross combo follow up with a haymaker then follow up by a single leg take down
Huhuuhu ryan best
I think garcia must learn more footworks
How come pple said Ryan is warrior & came back, homie was winning the whole time 🤣          I want to see if he gets humbled after he’s 1st loss
Gg garcia hed hed hed body nice
Can you ask Ryan what percent power he put on that body shot? A friend and I have a bet on it.
riiiivaaa buroruuuuu 💥
Tank will destroy Ryan
Ryan needs a lot of that punch so he may get put his feet on the ground. Young blood, you have so much to prove. Humble yourself.
Bro got up like nothing 😂
Garcia can't even accept his knock down
Haney, Temo, or Tank is going to destroy him if his defense and footwork don't improve.
What opened up that body shot was a faint...canelo had to show him that..he does it often
Great match . Rematch?
García. Sin comentarios 😶
GARCIA STEPPING FOOT TO CAMPBELL
Exposed
The whole world was cheering when Garcia went down. He indeed showed them who he is, Ryan Garcia.
Lucky punch babyface
5:16 - This is why Eddy Reinoso is regarded as a top coach. Ryan is pumped by a solid punch and comes to his corner to be scolded by his coach, reminding him to remain focused. Best thing that has happened to Ryan.
That's the problem southpaws face ,they are open to liver shot
This is only my opinion now dont get mad.  But that was a decent left hook that dropped r.g. yes he came back and won wich is what champs do. But I don't see him being able 2 eat a gervonta Davis uppercut. N I really hope Davis stops saying Ryan is too young to fight him. Tank and ryan is the fight 2 make!  Any1 else would like 2 c that fight?
FIGHT INOUE OR CASIMERO !

Someone was bound to hit with that hook I mean like his face is always open
Wow wonderful highlights
Мураджан на много мощнее его ушатает его без проблем
Ахмадалив мкрад порвет лично думаю его без проблем
I wonder how much they paid cambell to take the fall ? Smh weakest hit of 2020
cant even compare this bulshit to the ufc
Este chamaco inflado gervonta Davis le rompe el. Ozico fácil pero nunca los enfrentaran
Campbells calfs are so thin I can't unsee it.
And jake Paul says he can knock out Ryan Garcia
Ryan still learning to control his emotions.
Both men are real heroes.
Luck.....
learn not to give up. or don't even compete.
How did his rib cage not break
it's ok ryan you still 24-0 but that knockdown scared me it wasn't really a knockdown it was more of a trip
Who wants to profit from crypto investments
Doesn’t matter who’s fighting, I always enjoy the reactions in slow motion replays
Another shouty boxing commentator. What a pain, but he no doubt thinks he makes it exciting.
The AOC is not in downtown.
Cambel's face looks 10 years younger than ryan's
This kid is lethal when he wants to be but he needs to show more defense
3:30 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ну кембел и мешок)))
This is real boxing
The end of Garcia's too much hype
Come on look who he is fighting he need to fight someone known
patay kay pakyaw yan parang hatton mangyari dyan
I wish he knocked Ryan out tiktok Muppet
Whos the commentator? Sounds like rogan isit him? Have a nice day=)

Now he just needs humility
Why can't the UFC get crowds back like in this event?
Finally first tough opponent for Garcia
👑🤡
Garcia moral lesson your enemy upgrade now hard victory to you
I just ate when i saw that liver punch mine hurt aswell
I think boxing and MMA both are inhuman sports...instead of it just punch speed and power and defense mechanism against machine should be judged and that sports should be continued in this way
As someone who watched anime this goes hard 👑😈 fire 🔥🔥🔥
Campbell should have put the pressure after the knockdown .
The fight was rigged ! Just know that.
Every great has been there. Even Money Mayweather got knocked out in his career.
I hate to say it but Garcia dont want tank at all.
COCKYBELL
Garcia is a very fast puncher and that was an awesome body shot....but I cannot see him beating Gervonta Davis. Respect to him if he targets a fight with Davis...but I suspect his management will go for other targets
Garcia is pound for pound Top 10 ... did a better job than Lomachenko!
Far out my ribs hurt just watching that blinder of a body shot    💥 🥊
Disgrace to boxing
LOL who tf drops their hand like that to block a punch
Wow
Got punched in the liver  My legs : im outta here
as i watch the fight...campbell is always open at the body....and ryan sees it...he punch it with full power
amazing liver punch from ryan.
This kid is going to become a man. A badass man.
Next Pacquiao vs garcia
How quick did Garcia recover?...instantaneous recuperation...that's because he's young and in incredible shape....he's got the makings of a great champion....as for luke me personally?....i wouldn't have let him fight so quick after having covid...and it was no surprise he got stopped to the body... that's not Garcia's fault that's just my personal opinion.... no way would i allow my fighter to fight so quickly having all just recovered from covid....especially against someone as young fresh and dangerous as Garcia
2:37 Охуенный удар, Браво
If Luke followed through with the right straight he was gonna throw when he knocked Garcia down the first time, he would have knocked Ryan out.
No wonder he was a trending search a while back

7:31 Nice Face shield
Ryan gets knocked out at 2:40
Got clipped and went down. Got straight back up brushed it off and didn't panic like most people would do. Class
Campbell looked like super punch out character
ryan garcia is always stepping on his opponent's foot
Luke look taller, even he keep his legs wide apart
The Holy Spirit is Among You Garcia.
Well placed punch did the job.Entertaining fight.
Ryan needs to train on his defense. Putting your arm like that to block punches will not work with elite fighters. Bend your waist, put your hands up and move.
Garcia should fight Haney next. Lopez needs to fight Tank
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 🥊🥊
Гарсие ненадо играться, ато можно и уснуть!
3:21 canelo shout at the back to calm down garcia
Guess Corona doesn’t exist in Texas
garcia showing off alot on IG and gets dropped.. shii
L .n
Ryan vs loma LOL freaking joke!!!
This was the first time I saw ryan Garcia fall down
Ryan has a devastating mix of Speed & Power, that most Boxers lack today. He just needs to put his skill together & work on defense. He's not fluid either, he seems to think a little too much about what he has to do. Boxing should be 2nd nature without much thinking. Once he does this, he'll be a force to deal with. He's moving to fast, needs to slow down.
That liver shot did  more damage than any alcoholic..
walang magagawa style ni ryan garcia kay pacman kapag sila ang naglaban
Garcia has speed & power but he really needs to upgrade his defense..
And now you want to fight manny Pacquiao?😪
LO+VE
Poli man
After when Ryan got knocked down I thought that was it.. but man he got up so quick and took that punch like a champ.
Clean liver shot goddame 🤫
Ryan Garcia🥶
Rocky balboa comeback
_Yo digo que debe haber revancha, creo que hasta hoy en día, es el único boxeador que a mandado a la loba a Ryan dejándolo casi noqueado, tienen un gran estilo de pelea, aparte a Luke se le notaba desde el inicio esa combinación que quería hacer, hasta que lo logro una revancha, toda pagarían por verla pero es más obvio que no va pasar, porque sería el final de la carrera de Ryan si lo noqueara Luke, y eso no beneficiaria en nada a Ryan, Luke es un oponente muy fuerte y se nota, mucha rapidez, apesar que soy mexicano muy gran boxeador Luke._ 🔥
Jake Paul you up to bat next with Ryan Garcia.  Ha ha
Дэвис нокаутирует Гарсию в 4 раундах, может и раньше.  Гарсия еще плохо обученный боксер, нокдаун пришел оттого, что руки вниз ушли, а у хорошего бойца они должны были быть у головы.
The body shot challenge really came in to play
Now ryan knows what it takes like to be hit for real. if that left hook came from donaire, thurman,tank and you are sure go to pacman? You got many work to do ryan.
finally kingry went down. As thurman said a body shot either hurts or not hurt at all. Unfortunately Campbell got hit on the 'ouch' side of the pain scale.
Ryan vs Manny?
i want to see a rematch
Go King Ryan!!!
Is it me or that body shot looked soft in full speed, but in slow mo i could feel pain in my liver
No me parecio justa
Love watching Garcia mKes me want to start fighting again. No matter how far away you get from the sport it still Makes you shadow box at home and when no ones around. So addictive and nothing beats the feeling of winning.
Más comprado que las peleas de Canelo y Floyd Mayweather JAJAJA
caught with an over hand left and now u want to fight Manny Pacquiao??
I knew he was going to win
i think garcia need to think twice if he still wants to fight tank davis because if davis touches that chin i don’t see him getting up that knockdown is a big W for campbell even if he loses this fight his still the winner of this fight
Anyone gonna talk about the crowd?
A young Chicano boxer bro let's gooo!!  Ryan beast Garcia
Honestly I legit thought Ryan was not gonna get up because he’s never like ever got knocked down before so I got scared at that moment But he’s a beast
No es invencible ... también le entraron golpes
Yes he got knocked down, but he is still very young and still learning what matters is that he won.
ryan dont face tank unless you have better like WAY better n faster defense skills bro. if this guy knocked u down, imagine tank doing the same thing but with 5 times the power. idk man just saying 🤷🏻‍♂️
Something about Ryan hit the floor made me feel bad/sad
👍👍👍
Comdise chabes. La. Cabesa cae. Sola.

Saw it live great fight!!
I mess with that cover photo we all hate Ryan Garcia and no one knows he won.
Garcia's left hand is devastating..he got hand speed. But in this fight showed hes not invincible
That was a crisp liver shot👌🔥
We all know tank gonna win this 😂
If you look closely you can see on slow mode. That ryan Garcia, hits him in the liver. This caused Luke body to react and lockdown since hitting the liver with extreme for like ryan Garcia did can cause dmg and then Luke's body just went into shutdown and he collapsed.
Fake sports
As a major Ryan Garcia detractor all I can say is I'm impressed. The kid got back up and won that fight. Showed character and a lot of heart. Great job kiddo!
Next up should be Devin Haney.
Cuando se va a enfrentar a alguien digno este pibe García, título fabricado,,
i wouldnt want to get a body shot like that ever! Oof
Farsa
Ryan Garcia needs to work now! on his technique
Great fight for Garcia.  Now he's real fighter.  He got knocked down.  He survived.  He took care of business.  Campbell did him a big favor with that knockdown.
Flat footed most times, and that chin stays high moving backwards
I think that knockdown will do nothing but help Garcia’s career as he will now learn from his mistakes can’t wait for his next one
Es el unico golpe k tiro al higado ubiera terminado antes si lo usara mas segido campbel siempre tubo la mano derecha arriba pidiendo un golpe alli
I saw it before the fight people said it would be easy win for campbell.
No defense on Garcia’s corner.
🤟🤟🤟🤟✊✊
Nice
What a fight! Both very technical boxers
Ryan Garcia 👉🏼👈🏼😍
Now please go and do the same to lopez. Like to see his gring over the lost belts :)
I literally checked the speed of the video
What a beautiful left hook by luke👍👍👍
Now imagine Tank Hitting him Ryan gotta long way to go im telling you
that was a lightening fast punch to the body. FK!!!!
ryan can be easily knocked out
ryan looked to dumb that fight

Something about that Aztec blood. That warrior mentality 💪🏽
That shot to the liver was brutal.
Fix your flat foot Ryan, you'll up your game some more. Don't fix it..lose against someone who's going leverage against your weakness on next fight.
Garcia my Boy
7:35.       7:45.      ;-;
Gervonta gonna eat this man alive
Tank will dust you
this actually was way better than any highlights a youtuber could produce
Why they keep letting non-black boxers fight brown men, it is dangerous.
The slow motion replay of the shockwave on Luke's body from Ryan's punch looks extremely painful 🤢
Tank hit him with a left like that he’s not getting up
buenísimo rían
Bruh Gracia is bwing overhyped bu canelo that kid is no where near any in the top
If he pressured more after knocking Garcia down he would’ve won.. but ggs and oooowwweee Garcia I know you felt that hook 🤣
7:38 wow Garcia top 🔝 🧨🧨

Xaryu doing boxing now?
ryan garcia vs jake paul ufff
Says he likes southpaws but his front foot placement is shocking. Inside of a southpaws front foot? Outside sets up the jab and left hooks better.
Jesus Christ that body shot must be extremely painful
THE MEXICAN BLOOD RULES
Ryan is so cute.
Ryan Garcia is now challenging Manny Pacquiao. He taught that he has the power to stop manny haha. Imagine if manny land his signature left straight to Ryan's face. If he can get up to campbell left hook well manny's puch is a lot different. Sweet dreams to garcia haha🤣
that was interesting!!!
Hope garcia gets better...because the ones who start amazing at the beginning of careers often gas out later..
Garcia too flat footed for me..Still hes only 22 , great power and procession and knocked out an elite fighter,  hats off to him...
Dude this guy already has more views then the Canelo fight that happened weeks ago.
I’m just rewatching coz I’m bored
only one thing is for sure. Campell's carrier is over.
Basically Ryan hit Luke in the lower part of the ribs which is protecting live and there is nerves that were sent to the brain and it was deleayed but then he went down
What I’ve been waiting to see! Man was never tagged like he was there so we never knew how he would react, and he stayed in it like a champ
Impressive
0:48 ryan throw a right and missed by a mile, commentator " OH Straight right hand that got campbell attention"
Knocked out let’s go Ryan 💪🥊🥊🥊
Teófimo lopez se lo come a este García
Afghanistan 🇦🇫
Fenomenal la misma carrera del Saúl felicidades desde arandas jalisco
Question guys i don't know anything about boxing but if they punch do they breath in or out?
Let’s go Ryan you king
Something didn't convince me at all about this fight and about Garcia ...
That body shot breaks a ribs
This men still cheating on his wife thoe
for casuals as I never got it myself. That wasn't just a normal body shot, that was perfectly on the liver, livershots are the most painful (legal) punch you can get. It doesn't matter how tough you think you are, your body stops responding to it. I was cheering Luke on and wanted him to win, but let's be honest here he was not just out gunned, but out pointed too! Garcia just shot up in my book.
Ryan García, otro globito del boxeo moderno.
Y ese quiere pelear con el pupilo de  Mayweather jr naaaah el tanque lo mata le desprende la cabeza del cuajo
That hook was thrown with deadly deadly intentions ☠️
Bring on the tank 😈. Ryan is ready
Ryan need to stay away from  Stevenson and Davis
6
Any given Sunday
After watching this luke warm fight ive came to the decision that Ryan aint got nothing for Gervonta Davis
Oh! oh..blue print for king ry😬
7:39 for the big liver shot
you can tell ryan was scared after the knockdown hopefully davis does something to him he still needs to be humbled
Ryan got up so quick from that, if that was me I would of just took a nap instead
Took all the anger out from the malu memes😭😭
The new Ali
2nd time watching,,,, who else lol
Dumb campbell, he stop attacking after he k.o. garcia..he should've finish him when he has the chance 🤣
He s not strong Ryan ,vs qazaq he get down
*Body shots, while often being underminded and therefore undefended, can lead to those types of situations*
Garcia needs to work on his footwork. A lot. It's horrible and is going to get him into trouble time and time again
Anyone else agree dazn have the worst commentators ever!!
Garcia proved the to the haters hes not all hype
Garcia flash in pan his chin so high easy to hit
Ryan this is a lesson for you to train and stop making vids with the paul's
Wow 21-0 let’s go ry
Que vergazon le metió.
He talking bout he gonna do Tank something🤣🤣🤣🤣
Give me this little kid rayn gracia I will knock him out surely🇮🇳 👊✍
They trying to push Garcia vs Davis even more after this one
Дайте его Шохжахона
Soft chin and he wants pacquiao?
Fixed
2:43  Ryan Garcia: Ight bet 😈
he is not going to beat davis though.
Not a lot of head movement
デイビスには絶対勝てないな今のままでは
Да но почему не осчитал 10 секунд это не правельно, не кто не знает какой у него запас прочности
Slow mo replay at 7:40... Picked up on the richter scale.  Credit to Campbell who gave his all. No shame in losing to Garcia, who will go very far.
Those body shot challenges sure helped
Ryan is Legit 🥊⭐
Ryan garcia no footwork. Basic to defeat him. Your lucky campbell is weak.
great the highlights is great! awesome, unlike other highlights.
despite the guys calling the fight saying he likes to fight south paws i think thats why he got dropped.  found himself open and exposed when he normally wouldnt be.  great heart getting up and coming back for the tko win.  id like to see him fight tank davis.  i hate when people say hes not ready...i think hes well prepared for that fight.  he might not win but hes as ready as he will ever be
i want to see fight ryan garcia vs eroll spence or terence crawford :)
I wounder if Campbell quit here. First 1 knee and then 2 knees and gets back up at the count of 9 but 10 be too late?
Ryan garcia mental juara... luka campbell down duluan padahal sama" kuat
Loma and Garcia, battle of technicians. I want to see that
finally
Goes to show how much I don't know about boxing
Garcia you lucky
That was an arm punch, if that was from tank the kid would have never got back up.
EL ASOMBRO DEL CANELO MAS FALSO QUE NADA
The one announcer is so bad it’s cringe
garcia shows already his weakness a glass jaw
Hard to fight a lefty
Ryan is the best
In the third round he couldn't stand if he got that hit from David gervonta  He's not ready for the tank
Garcia: mucho poder, rapido, pesima guardia, demasiada confianza, un ego muy pendejo ( se siente dios )
"Pretty Boy's with a Meeeeeeean Streak" thats only the half of it.
Manny Pacquiao will always be the greatest southpaw 💪🏼
Mucho movimiento de cintura le falta al ryan pelea muy derecho no lo veo contta gervonta💯👍💯🇲🇽👍🇲🇽💯
If you have Reddit, Ryan’s official sub has been made. r/KingRy
It's even cooler vasyl lomachenko when it comes to Luke campbell
2:39
Ну то что Гарсия мешок это понятно но что произошло с Кембелом это не он был.
Este morro ya agarro el estilo del Canelo,  y la neta NO, este morro esta para combatir como un JC, UN TERRIBLE MORALES, MARQUEZ,  ese estilo le viene mejor al.morro porq tiene todo para ser un GUERRERO, .
someone wants to fight PAC using flat footed style? really?
Dazn need some new commentators
With out liver punch garcia lose the figth
wow respect
lucky shot
best highlights
Garcia got dropped and he steps up to Campbell after just landing a solid punch. Would you rather have to get up off the ground or eat a punch at the end of a round? Lol
Le dio break para recuperarse, el tenia que caerle rápido que se levanto..
Body shot is  terrible 🤣🤣🤣🤣 so much pain
And Ryan wants to fight pacquiao? U kidding right?????.
i wish to see Ryan Garcia vs Vasyl Lomachenko.. this gonna epic to watch..
Tank will eat this dude 🤣
muntik pa matalo.
Ive always wanted garcia to taste the canvas for once
Ryan getting ready to get knocked out Fr
Davis all day what’s up who wants to bet
a body shot for the ages 👑
Nice shot luke
That wasn't a knock out. That was a gutt shot.
Campbell's shot was like MP's signature shot. Right feint then left hook.
after the first knochdown campbell could easily finish him, he gave him too much respect
That was the fastest 10 count ever in boxing history.
He need to be a humble person 🤔🤔🤔
6:00 man, that guillotine could've finished Campbell earlier, he got lucky.
After the K.D. he should've made more pressure punches to Garcia and that should've done it
He send jake first to hospital
Ryan Garcia is actually making boxing exciting again
Clean liver shot
You can see the kid got that RAW SAUCE ...
Para declararse rey debería pelear con teofimo García....para mi el mejor, sin dejar de apreciar a gracia, uno de los mejores
Realize how jake Paul won 2 fights and is a clown but Ryan Garcia has countless win compote jake and he didn’t change like that like At This point I hate that clown
Totally weak. Anyone in online coaching I have 5 spot's open for only $250 a month. Want to get stronger and look like a melted candle, contact me ASAP.
Then he wants Pacquiao? 😅
Ryan got a little too hype imo after that fight,,,
I always love seeing liver shot, its like you got no option but to crumble in pain. Peñalosa did it to Gonzalez to score an upset. Anyone here that experienced it describe how liver shot works when u got hit by one?
campbell's arm looks so long..is it just me or is it really long hahhaa
GGG VS KONELO 3
Ryan is developing a similar style to Canelo, yet he still lacks the footwork and head movement. I'm sure he will continue to better as he is only 22.
Thank you...what a great sport when it is done in all integrety
Like that play, he would not be even match with pacman be like a tiger hunger for wins.
Campbell should've went for broke after that knockdown
Ryan seems weak davis would k.o him is a few hits that did land right...smh
🔥🔥🔥
Imagine that was Tank Davis throwing that hook. Ryan Garcia would be missing his head..
That knock down is going to get him belts.
Garcia really wants to fight Davis next I don’t think he’s ready honestly he should have a couple more fights before he gets in the ring with tank
I don't know the rules but are you allowed to step on the other guys foot?
Ropes kept him up? But the bell was rung.
Is he ready for tank tho really?
Garcia is super.... 👍👍
Well I don't find Today's Boxing matches intresting but this one is quite fun to watch
Imagine a Garcia-Pacquiao fight.
Its like linares vs lomachenko lol, and its funny bcs ryan and lomachenko are both aquarius😂 nvm. Now, i want to see tank vs kingry please make that happen
Like cambell w the lefty
Garcia will be Boxing version of Rousey
Imagine if davis catches Garcia on his chin.
Is Campbell a boxer ?
Ryan got knocked down for the 1st time
Ouch dem ribs tho😢
If ryan lost this fight it will hunt him
👏 this is a show 💯💯💯
That knockdown was Ryan's wake-up call. And boy, did he wake up!
7:38 Deadly Body Shot. ☠️☠️☠️
They're lucky they didn't meet Pacman in that Division
Idk why but I prefer body shot KOs.
2:40 the new Glass chin " he alwyz talk about Amir khan has glass chin and he is the One
At 4:17 Luke Campbell did a mistake, he had an absolute opportunity to knock Garcia out. Garcia did not know where the heck a punch from Luke would come from. You missed your belt Campbell
Campbell messed up when he didn't attack after the knockdown. That was his opportunity and he missed it.
WE WILL REMATCH!!!@ CAMPELL VD GARCIA GOO GARCIA DESTROYYYYYY!!!!
Hmmp that womaniser
Great humbling experience. Promising career ahead of Garcia no doubt. Will he be able to compete with the top seed? Doubtful at his current skill level. He’s got great speed but his footwork and head movement are non existent. That could all change with Canelo in the corner though.
That hook it's only a glimpse of what Tank Davis will have him going through.... So sad
This clown thinks he will beat TANK NO WAY
Ryan's chin is exposed
Ryan exposed!
These 2 guys impressed me. Garcia has the hand speed, the combinations, and the ferocity, he comes back from the canvas dictating the rhythm. Campbell impressed me with his footwork, his ability to read his opponents, I think he still has a future, he looks improved from his fight with loma.  I reckon Garcia obtained that body shot from canelo, he was able to make it look like an uppercut but instead it was a  body shot, absolutely beautiful, I am excited to see these 2 improve more and fight loma or lopez.
A FUTURE MILLIONAIRE WILL LIKE THIS COMMENT
Match spettacolare!
Davis gonna hurt this kid 🤫
Campbell's punch looked like Marquez bomb in rd 3 of pac vs marques 4. Shorter version but same results.
Adesso devi affrontare gerwonta davis
Davis will TKO this kid🤦🏾‍♂️
Why are too much dislikes xd?
GARCIA WAS SHOCKED WHEN HE GOT KNOCKDOWN
I like Luke Campbell but how is it possible for a champ to have literally zero head movement nothing
man this kid hits hard.. that body shot was ferocious
Ryan Garcia is no cross dressing Del A Hoyaint....Ryan will make a name for himself
Garcia is defensively weak. He needs work
Man After that knockdown Luke should of jumped all over him and tries to finish him there and then 🤷‍♀️
First ever  body punch knock out I have seen recently, never seen in old boxing
I Can't Wait For Him to Fight Davin Haney and Davis
That body shot went straight to me too. Jesus that slow motion shot.
this is the new boxing sensation? give me a break. wait til he goes against some real opposition. guy is open like a flower, a real champion will dismantle this kid, who by the way went down a'la kahn. no chi chin baby. first punch of his life and almost lights out. julio cesar chavez is laughing his balls off.
I wish him all the best, 😊🤙🏾But he is still weak and needs more training 🤔 who is agree with me?????
Wow hahahaha knock down davis is smiling on that garcia's knockdown
This commentator is raw
Now we know he has no jaw and will fall hard when caught again
So dead ending...
Boxing is so fake
eh, Luke is another pub fighter coming to USA and trying to win a fight by throwing 3 punches all night. its pathetic to look how these dudes just stand there and wait to be hit and once they are hit they go down or are so hurt that are unable to fight no more. Kell Brook did the same whole his career.
Next     Ryan Garcia vs Vasyl Lomachenko
7:10
Dana white: boxing is dieing.
Had Luke not seen previous fights Garcia had ? .
If he wants to fight the very best in his division. He needs to keep his body moving. Standing still will get him knocked out.
nazim, ricky ,amir and  now campbell go hispanic  beat the britisiihs haha
swag knockout mad respect 100!!!!
Al puro estilo mexicano ese gancho al hígado.
He dont want to see Tank Davis 🤷🏿‍♂
Mma guys can box but  can boxers  fight in octagon. anyway garcia is a rising start
as a person who got this on their recommended randomly boxing is amazing
This is the Real Pretty Boy
Bruh there’s fans in the stadium I’ve missed this so much!!!
They really used the pictured of Ryan getting rocked in the thumbnail😂
Decepcionante el inglés, y a García le falta muchísimo.!
Ryan is great no doubt. But this showed me how overrated he is. He’s no Camelo or mayweather. Not even close. This kid is way too stiff for his size and won’t last long if he wants to fight in his 30s. Usually fighters this stiff are late in there career. But who knows. If he’s a true champ he can adapt.
I love how Jake Paul wanted to fight this guy 😂😂😂
It was amateur night.
Es muy payaso ese garcia
Garcia never fought someone experienced like Campbell, it shows because Garcia isn’t blocking that’s why he got dropped
The king will eventually fall like the rest. Tank will make sure of that.
Man that body shot looked very sore haha
Ryan when he got nock out:call the ambulance but not for me  *Campbell gets nock out*
why did not Campbell go straight after Ryan after knockdown , he could easily end the fight, he had enough time and strength. He allowed the young fighter to regain his legs and lost
I'm sorry to say it, but I believe that Ryan needed to be humbled. His ego was over bloated. From this point on, he'll be more careful and he will never underestimate his opponents!!
Congrats to King Ry that left haymaker hook would’ve knocked out any other lightweight including López and Davis
Garcia fights like browl school.
Only 22... bright future ahead.
canelo
Tank Davis i don't so Ryan felt how it to knocked down he is not invisible
Well he is definitely going to meet a real southpaw in Davis...hope the fight happens
2:40 😭 he got stepped on
I don't think he ready for "Tank" yet
Ryan IghT... he far from one of the goats tho
Gervonta win
11 years older and that happened...
Ryan garcia  work on your head movement and foot work an you'll be ok you well beat dav iui a if you fight careful learn from canelo exactly let's go wait a whole year enjoy train train enjoy peace iam gone
That pivot @4:17 too smooth.
Una pelea q merece una revancha 👌🇵🇦🔥
That straight right from garcia looks like pacmans signature leap right straight
Liver punch oof
Solo le devolvio el golpe, y le enseño como se hace👊
Looks like he got shot by a shotgun
He leaves himself open like this vs tank he’s going to bed 😴
Amazing
Any amateur MMA can destroy Ryan Garcia
Great job by Ry but he is totally not ready for Tank Davis. Nowhere near close tbh.....Congrats Ry Garcia.
Nc bodyshot! 😍😍👌
“He’s never been in trouble” Never being knocked down gets to a fighters head. I just believe humility proves a lot. Talkers are nervous (like mcgregor vs may weather, khabib etc) he’s never had to dig down way deep. I don’t think he can handle Gervonta. Vonta’s humble and calm demeanor to Ryan’s talk is scary in n of itself. Sorry but I got Vonta.
7:38 that body shot 🙌 woo phew never want that on my body
He learnt that from Canelo , perfect body shot liver damage
If that power punch came from tank it could put you to sleep like stacruz and even Rolly will beat the glass out of your chin🤣🤣🤣
And I also subscribe you
Did anyone catch the refs eyes on the slowmo replay when he saw the body shot.
Ryan Garcia I love your videos
Grassia I love your videos
is this a old or a new fight
That was a washed up Luke Campbell- Teofimo Lopez Sr
Ryan tryna be like Floyd 😄
One shot like that by tank Ryan is in a coma
4:02 I wonder what would have happened if Ryan landed that punch is insane.
Garcia will learn from this fight tremendously. He’s the next greatest since Floyd. Buuut Canelo just started his prime....
Lalaban Ka ni Pacman tapos Ka Ur end
Ryan Garcia had a weak Legs
Este chavo está muy inflado por los medios, espero que un día un buen mexicano le parta su madre por presumido. He is just an Instagram guy.
Ryan García lo quisiera ver contra Linares aún con la edad q tiene Linares le da cátedra a Ryan García
Le pusieron a prueba la quijada a García
i want a rematch
Man they had a crowd
Bro got knocked by a random
I gotta hand it to the kid , he's got star power but props to Campbell for giving cia a run for his money
Watching this fight on the night i was gutted how biased the dazn commentators were towards garcia. Making out garcia made some amazing shots when hes just touching gloves and ignoring what campbell was throwing  back. The rounds were far closer than they made out. Puts me off watching fights on dazn.
I wonder if that was mannys left hook😂
Great fight 🦾
You're gonna sleep soon boya…
Un tronco garcia😂solo es publicidad que de boxeador no tiene nada de otro mundo,
Ryan Garcia blander than vanilla ice cream.
Who els came back here after the motivational video of Eric Thomas.
not even lomachenko could knock out campbell !! go ahead jorge linares
Lomachenko no cant ko campbell !! Next Jorge linares
The first viewer must feel like the king of the world...
El que se detuvo a leer este comentario que Dios Lo bendiga Y lo proteja del COVD-19 a ti y tu Familia ♥☺•...
Un tipo con hambre, con olor a sangre hubiese ido por Ryan cuando lo tumbo en el 2do asalto
This kid has talent he is super fast and now we know he has big heart and some balls
Correct me if im wrong but canelo does something similar to the punch that knocked garcia down , he pretends hes going for the body after the jab making the opponent try to block his body leaving his head exposed and then in an instant canelos hook changes direction and goes up towards the head .
Appreciated
Watching the slow motion at 3:25 and then seeing the kid just brush it off so seamlessly was really impressive
***Instagram model/ influencer beats up British plumber. ***
Garcia vs pagara Sana Malupit Yun haha
🤣🤣🤣 dropped by a light puncher 🥊
Ryan is a fucken gee this cat got up like a real champ then won
Son de esos guadañazos que dice el César te dan ganas hasta de cagar mijoo.
Ryan's footwork looked weird to me, no pivoting and really straight legs/flat feet as mentioned. Yeah itll let him hit harder but it leaves you open a lot especially when your face is wide open. Besides that and the extending his arms, he did really well. Round 6 he went crazy lol
I can see Pacman in Garcia's style of punches.
How is Jake Paul calling out Garcia????????????does he actually think he’s gonna win?genuine question,asking for a friend
Boring
Garcia has no foot work.
pretty sure Davis would KO Garcia
Man idk , Ryan is a great fighter . Got caught by Luke got dropped and got right back up . But idk if he's ready for Tank . Personally I think Leo Santa Cruz is a better fighter than Ryan . Leo was KO'D by a viscous uppercut by tank . I belive luke does not hit as hard as Tank . So yes I am excited for that fight to happen.  But with the way promoters work . They will push for Devin Haney and Ryan Garcia to fight 1st . Depending if Ryan comes out victorious will determine if he ends up fighting Tank . Just like Tank Davis wanting to fight Lomachecko , since Teofimo lopez won that fight . It doesn't make that fight to happen as exciting . Yes I still would like to see Loma and Tank fight . But im sure we would see Tank and Lopez fight 1st .
قناه حلوه مر عليها اذا معجلتك لا تشترك 🤩🥰
Tank would beat tf out Ryan I'm sorry bro
A great great hilight as always DAZN!
García lucky
He shoulda went after him when he knocked him down. Let him recover? Lol ok. Didn’t seem like the “smart” decision after all. When Mike tyson knocks a guy down and they get up... he makes sure to hunt them down shortly after. But then again this guy has never fought a beast like that. Tank is comin
Ya comprándole las peleas como al Canelo, vaya que van a lo mismo, pinche boxeador de 4
He not getting up from Davis left hook
A García le va a pasar lo k a casa mayor con Márquez. Le van a kitar lo ablador y Teófilo lo va a sentar de culo
His defense is always the weak spot. And I'm glad he's been shooked and eveb humbled by that. He's got a powerful offense. If he works on improving his defense, protects the chin more and not be irresponsibly aggressive, then he'll be unstoppable
Garcia will get mauled real soon...he is about power shots all the time...too flat flooded and hardly any defense...his feetwork tho is what gives him the edge in fights he gets into great striking positions
The famous body punch a lot of famous people tried that challenge on his instagram.
Tank , Lopez and Loma beats Garcia
I like Garcia but he needed that face punch 🤪🥊
想ったより、たいしたことないのかも。このクラスにあんなでかいパンチを食らうなんて。ロペスやガーボンタに勝てそうには見えなかった。戦う相手が強くなってきて弱点が見え始めている。
Easy fight, get on Davis already quit waiting
How you gonna claim being mexican but can't speak spanish smh 🤦‍♂️
Imagine if King Ryan comments on this
Back to the drawing board luke

I don't see anything great about ryan garcia he needs a lot of work.
Bruh that liver shot looks painful.. Ugh...
Awesome fight
Canelo's ring experience will be one of the key to beat tank davis. Ryan needs to learn a lot from Canelo.
Very entertaining fight and respect to Garcia for showing his mettle an getting back up from a huge shot he didn’t anticipate and then coming back to stop a fighter who’s never been stopped. Also shout out to Luke for giving his all, done his country proudly. Tank vs Garcia should be next, 50-50 fight IMO
Amateur Boxing Game
Lomachenko vs Garcia 🙏🏻
All thanks to @richardscott36 on telegram he made me smile and I will never forget him in my life, I just gotten my amex CC with $8000 on it 🥰 I wish I met him months ago, more deals coming
Caleb es bueno, pero creo que no era para que resistiera hasta el 8vo; demostró debilidad Ryan, por lo menos eso creo, estoy seguro que Caleb no le llega al 2do a Gervonta Davis.
When cool hand goes luke warm.
sold
My respect for both fighters , but Ryan is such a beast , kid is going places ! 🇺🇸🇲🇽🙏🏻
Why wouldnt luke put all the pressure on Ryan after the KD? That was his biggest mistake that night
South paw
I want to see him against Naoya Inoue
IF  Ryan improves his movement (specially his head) and practices on his defense he will dominate tank david
Luke Campbell does not look 33
I love how Ryans answers Campbells body shot with a body shot
I smell a first loss for Mr. Garcia...
que gancho...implacable, esta para grandes cosas este muchacho....buen video chamo...
Campbell is too humble, he should’ve finished the job right that knock down
Мощные бойцы
Now I’m not i’m not saying Ryan Garcia didn’t win that fight, the only thing that upsets me is that this place doesn’t show the whole story. They completely skip Ryan Garcia getting knocked down. They’re literally building a narrative for their golden boy here and destroying future possible champions. Politics like this is what hurt the sport of boxing in the first place.
Tank knocks garcia out
Pacquiao could easily....
*drinking session*  girls: i want a body shot ryan: you sure?
If Luke Campbell unloaded punches after that vicious knockdown on Garcia then he could’ve finished this fight early. I guess he was a little scared to do that.
you.ll have to eat more rice to face pacquiao.
Cambell didnt show experience and gave to much respect to the kid. After the ko he should of pressured  .
Hopefully after this fight he shuts his freaking mouth & stops calling boxers out & thinks he's invisible! TANK DAVIS WILL KNOCKED THE TEETH OUTNOF THIS KID! THATS THE FIGHT I WANT TO WATCH.
Je is the only person who is in charge of the in the morning and as I
glad he got knocked and not another maywheather
Seemed Garcia wanted to test his Chin. Bad knockdown, he was able to recover because of his being youth.
Ryan Garcia is the real deal
Ryan's fights are always amazing to watch
Kid got chin tho.
How much weight will they have gained in the fight, does anyone know?
Lol he's not ready for tank davis sorry ....
BAPAK KECIK KAKI 😩
Luke didn't trust his chin in round 2
what a great fight.
Hay demostró que no es nada del otro mundo , tiene quijada de mantequilla  y gano por un golpe de suerte , cuando pelee con Davi el tanque hasta hay llegó su suerte ,, jajaja vaya Rey de papel ,,
Garcia has some dynamite in those hands.

I watched the fight but honestly the commentators were making him out to be the second coming, but it was super tight for the first few rounds, watch it without the guff commentary!!
Now that's.... a fight... jesusss
Terrible defence by both guys,
,😊😊😊
Garcia v Tank would be an absolute explosive fight
He could have let his hands go when he had that knock down
Ryan dreaming of fight pacquiao when this fight was not impressive.
Cool video
As a southpaw, Ryan's tactics is a killer. He keeps his lead foot on the outside of Campbells lead foot and fights on the inside with a quick jab to keep Campbell on his toes and causes him to move his head. Then Ryan can continue to land the inside lead hook and follow with an uppercut
Think Tank beats him
If Garcia continues like this he will be a megastar. He can fight and he brings in the numbers. 8mil views after 2 days is big numbers on any YouTube boxing video

garcia have great heart in this fight, more stamina, also lucky but lucky is part of the game.  it gervonta davis a think is dont have any chance...well done kid
q pelea y eso q apenas iniamos el año, bien Ryan Garcia
And asking a fight against Pacquiao
Coup dure pour le boxeur des reseau
ese morro le falta meterle mas a su guardia, pesima guardia ryan
I wanna fight Garcia
Idk garcia that chin lookin suspect
Please stay away from gervonta Davis for a couple of years. Leo Santa Cruz May take Garcia out ?
davis will destroy this kid
Raul Garcia ❤🇹🇿
Im English and it seems that the British are trained to stand back and try and be more teqnical just throwing 1s and 2s jab jab,step back they don't follow on, but the yanks train for combinations,speed and getting that shoulder in to that punch and making it matter. I love watching the yanks fight,with the exception of the main man mr fury.
Hit ole Luke with that Canelo Body Shot...but Ryan gotta work on keeping that chin tucked in...if he gets hit flush like that by Tank or Teo...he aint getting up...real talk
This fight seemed very sloppy if you asked me. Ryan is the more talented fighter for sure but he has newbie habits like extending his arms when he thinks a punch is coming and idk what to think about it. He looks like a nimble guy but he had no footwork in this fight.
@2:38 When Tank Hit him with that much space he not getting up
If “Tank” Davis catch Garcia with a hit like that I guarantee he’s not getting up lbs 😳
Everybody saying he’ll lose to Tank but what if he beats him 🤔
Nice body shot with left handed super power in slow motion !!!
2:37
Mexicans Got It Baby
No foot work for ryan need to improve
Why do people think he's the next big thing? I see nothing special he's not even the best in that division.  He will be exposed eventually.
Esse é monstro 👊👍
I see many flaws in ryans defense. I think his career would not last very long
Boxing is probably the most applicable martial art to the street... If you run away, you probably won't get hit.
Nice!
Pónganle a teofimo López los boxeadores de goldenboy son cobardes no pelean con los leones puros ratones agarran
Now, that is boxing
I was screaming that from the beginning, "hit him in the liver".
In face knockdown it will make you lost consciousness for a few second but most of the time it will recover immediately but in body knockdown it will completely shutdown your whole body most of the fighter who got body knockdown they say they still wants to continue the fight their body just won't
Ryan was too open, lucky it was Campbell who knocked him down, if it was Tank Davis he wasn't going to get up.
Gracia's chin is suspect lol  Tank will end his career...
Buen trabajo, pero necesita trabajar en la defensa felicidades Ryan...!!!
Why 9?
This was an amazing fight 😍
Flash in action
Ryan said 😛😛😛😛... 🤯😵
Gervonta will spank him easy
Great victory for Ryan over a top-tier competitor like Luke Campbell, no doubt. However, I believe Ryan is biting off more than he can chew if he steps in the ring with Tank or Teofimo. Ryan’s length & ability to let his hands go will give any fighter issues, but with his lack of defense/head movement, I believe Tank would pressure Ryan, break him down, and eventually knock him out. And I see Teofimo outclassing Ryan, possibly knocking him out also. And I see Garcia vs Haney being a close fight...
That left to the body is already more exciting than Floyd's entire career...
After seeing this fight you better off fighting Haney stay as far away from tank as you can But honestly Haney will pick him apart so you may wana stay away from both of them lol
Thats Not fast man 🥱 chill youre life
where was the fight at
That right hook makes that kid think he's human afterall.
Luke should hav jumped on him in round 2 after that knockdwn...put the pressure and Ryan.maybe he could hav got  stoppage.garcia was in shock head wasnt clear.
Ryan is shocked 😄
Exelente gancho al hígado, firma del mejor " J. Chávez" 🇲🇽🇲🇽
Imagine Jake Paul in there with him XD
He’s not ready for Davis
Devin gone KO Garcia for show after seeing this
Ryan thinks he's invencible
Please go follow my brothers channel Colins Origami Tutorials 💕💕
Great video amazing fight ❤️🥊🥊
very weak chin...gervonta and teofimo waving at u👋😎
Let him fight tank, Loma, or Lopez and he’s going to lose. I like Garcia, but y’all overhype this dude
As soon as Ryan gets his defence up, he will be unstoppable
Comme dirait Patrick Sébastien... c’est génial 👍🏼😘
That was a CRAZY fight!
the US credit , the US bonds , it's big problem!  US force china cancel US  bonds!  but if is was not china , it was u , small country , u don't have choice!  because u are not china , u can't against US!
I want to see a rematch.. that’s one of the fight that I’m looking from boxing..
Leo Santa Cruz is a better over all fighter than Ryan Tank will stay in the pocket like he did with Cruz and Ryan will have bowel movement when he gets hit. One mistake with Tank and its over.
Does  Justin biebiers new video predicted the fight that rayan García was going to have??  its the the same story
Удар по печень,никто не вечен
Baby goat
2:38 and 7:12 Two biggest moments of the fight
Campbell should have pressed Garcia after knockdown, he would of been broken down.
Ryan is a King
Campbell so weak ,Garcia dont be so proud cuz Pacman not in ur Level anymore HAHA assuming to fight Pacman? dreaming 🤭
What a bodyshot at the end
Just about the most perfect body shot I've ever seen.
Was this the first time Ryan got Knocked down?
breaking news bitcoin fallen down!  because of world economy going down!  especially America  economy going down!  now we should left America asset!  because dollar will fallen down as bitcoin!
Such an amazing fight. So entertaining even watching it a second time
Ryan la mentira García
He ain’t ready for Gervonta Davis
we consider Double fine for money laundering participants bitcoin!
Burning heart
wow..that kid Campbell just exposed Garcia....other fighters will now improvise on this...
Loma hit luke in the same spot
Campbell had to push hard after get down Garcia
Yo Ryan what was that defense right before getting knocked down??
merci
Am i the only one who was mesmerised by luke campbells boxing in this fight?
That knockdown humbled garcia for life.
Ryan just got that youthful energy on his side and Campbell’s held out but his movements slowing down
The British are hilariously awful 😂,  Campbell "Ouch my tummy hurts" x
Gervonta Davis is going to win that fight!!!
That's insane considering Campbell took Loma to the distance. Boxing is so unpredictable at times
Amazing fight, so glad to have watched it live!
Tank will knockout Ryan Garcia and put him to sleep like a baby 💪🏾
2:43 U just see Ryan Garcia like, "ok i see how u wanna play, lemme show u sum real quick"
Ryan Garcia reminds me  of Miguel from cobra kai
😂😂😂😂😂😂This two are the strongest two in the world and they are very big 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Campbell's mistake was HE SHOULD HAVE GONE AFTER him much harder than that! Instead he took his time and Garcia recovered fast.
Nice vedio and funny much ❤❤
This has 7.7 mil on the 3rd day. And people really belive gervonta is a bigger star. So easy to tell that Ryan is the A side
Luke fought very well but that liver hit really did some work.
Codigo akim en rappi 👌
Luke still the winner for me
He ain’t ready for the Tank. He won’t have a chance to get up after one of his shots ☠️
thats a broken ribs! Tf
I’m from England and a fan of Garcia I think he’s got some talent there but not get to big for his boots
2:38 epic jajaja
Garcia quiso pelear como canelo y lo tumbaron no imites a nadie se tu mismo
Ippo will be proud of that body shot
That's why Jake Paul don't wath to figh him 😂😂😂
This guy always motivates me to hit the bags
DAZN Boxing let the real KINGS fight it out @evenkingsfall (insta) VS @floydmayweather (insta) in 2021 PLEASE! 👊👊 The press conference alone will be lit 🙏
campbell is  33 !!! he seeems like an 18 year old guy!
Garcia has fast hands but his lack of head movements..
The fight may have ended at 5th round. If it haven't ended in 7th then at 8th Campbell might be brutally knocked out.
7:58 mission success
If Campbell followed his knock down punch with a following right hand. ( like pacquio)  he could have layed Ryan to rest...just saying
So in boxing dropping someone with a body shot is a knockout? Do they have TKO in boxing?
Despite what the cards say I had Ryan losing up to the knockout but respect to him he’s shown it isn’t just a fluke
Garcia is trash. All hype.
I guarantee Davis will knock this kid out.
Still think Garcia will lose to Haney and maybe even Davis
2:37 oouuuchhhhh
Im so excited to see garcia vs manny pacquiao.
Asi se pelea canelas
Gervonta wld totally decimate Garcia.
Ryan Garcia. 🤴🏻
MiguelMorales ⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️4430
Ryan should fight Haney/Gamboa/ Leo Santa Cruz next. After this i think He would be ready for Tank Davis
Ryan Garcia does “a one punch BODY knockout” on Olympic gold medalist. Luke Campbell........an opponent who was never knocked out! Not by Vasyl, Not by Linares. Not ever. Gervonta does a one punch knockout on a non Olympic medalist.......on a guy who has been KOd before. Now take a vote: Is Ryan’s KO more impressive? Or is Gervonta’s KO more impressive? Please leave racial ethnic bias ignorance out and be truthful to yourself. Thumbs up 👍 for Ryan. Or Thumbs down 👎 for Ryan. We’ll take a vote.
Oop lol
He ain’t ready for Davis
New Amir Han
Nothing to be ashamed of. Campbell lost, but he exposed Ryan. Deserving of a rematch but yeah. The world wants to see Garcia-Davis.
Did everybody just stop caring Garcia cheated on his pregnant wife or do we just not care?
Молодец Раян
He should’ve gotten up quicker
I hate arrogant boxers like this clown Garcia hope this teaches him a lesson to be humble
Se o luke fosse mais raçudo, ele ganhava do garcia !!
My brain and body hurt after watching this fight 🤕
Rayan still look like a amateur fighter.
That body shot was on 🔥
Ryan Garcia best man👌🙂
That knock down will take some of Garcia's Cockiness away
Amir khan Glass chin
Istg best channel as highlights I’ve seen!
This kid wants to fight manny? Hahaha really?
That body shot challenge ain’t no joke
Lucki guy
Way to go kid!!!
Se nota que cambell lo perdono, el farsante ese estaba tocado, si cambell hubiera ido con todo después de esa caída ese farsante de Ryan no la contaba hubiera perdido por KO, pero el trato era que ganará el apadrinado ese, la farsa continúa
Wala tong garcia na to , di pa to uubra kay manny kahit 40+ na ang senator natin.
He showed him the hook then changed the course last second.vintage canelo style
Thought it was Gordon Ramsey with the commentary 6:33
Overrated boxer. Not impressed.
S
KOじゃなくてもライアンガルシアの勝ちだったねこの試合は でもやっぱりガルシアはボクシングスタイルの粗さが出た
Campbell's loss was bought.  That Garcia money train is just worth too much.... Boxing has and always will be corrupt.
Alverez with his own personalised face diaper. sausage .. Hahaha.
As an MMA fan I gotto say your commentators are absolute clowns. Had to watch it on mute.
Padahal si Luke aku jagokan...
He can't beat many paquiao in that situation...many is still fast... Too young to fight paquiao.
Mediocre.
Ryan is next up
OPINIÓN..YO DIGO QUE ES UN FRAUDE .EL TAL BRAYAN .Y DELA OYA . PURO CIRCO Y FRAUDE .QUE ASCO ME DA EL BOXEO ACTUAL .MUGRERO. ..
I think my kidney ruptured just watching him land that punch.
He was given a chin test and failed it
Liver Shot for the win
Well 2nd rounds proves that he just not  have power, talent or looks but more then that  this round proves that he has a iron chin love u man, fans from mt.everest
Soon as I saw him hit the liver like that I knew it was over.
Tank will  lost to Ryan due to too slow. Tank last fight he got tagged often but opponent has no power.
you see garcia you are human 2
3 ads in a 8min vid???  Pure nonsense.
I love how calm the commentators are when Garcia got dropped lol like they knew
Garcia can’t beat tank, haney , Lopez or Stevenson
I never seen got knocked out
Fix fight
Come on.  Garcia - Haney.  Let's do this in 2021.
ryan is a hard hitting beast
Campbell vs Ryan Garcia 2 should happen
Fue un buen golpe , de ahí en fuera veo a un chico que le falta aprender mucho en el box , no tiene defensa , no tiene variantes , alguien con un buen box enfrente lo noquearia fácil

Hard to hit RG even with long reach. Luke looking like he can't reach him sometimes with that long arms as RG is always out of his range.  Tank gets a lot of hit by smaller and slow guy, and Loma can't catch a small guy.  I won't be surprised if RG really beats them with distance and speed + power.

Although these are just highlights, this has showcased Ryan Garcia as not just an 'insta-fighter' as a lot of people (myself included) thought. Luke Campbell, an Olympic gold medallist (albeit at bantamweight), has said that Garcia has 'heavy' hands and is one of the hardest punchers he has faced. And with some of the speed Garcia has displayed in his social media videos he seems to be the complete package. This is further demonstrated by the fact he gets knocked down by Campbell and gets up (although it might have been a different story if Campbell had gone in for the finish but that's hypothetical). I think Campbell can still fight on, maybe fighting for a EBU title and gaining a world title fight via that route, or the other world champions may fight Campbell as a yardstick to see how they compare to Garcia (which equates to big paydays for Campbell if nothing else). This fight and subsequent victory shows that Garcia is ready to move up to world level against the likes of Haney, Davis, and Lopez and with his marketability there will be no issues with anyone fighting him as the payday will be significant. Well done to both fighters though. I should've figured out that Golden Boy (De La Hoya and Hopkins) as well as 'Canelo' would not be involved in someone that doesn't have the talent and work ethic to back up his social media presence but, as someone who's not really a fan of or really understands social media (i.e. old man!!), it was easy to brush him off as another boxer/celeb/wannabee. He's proved a lot of people wrong with this fight.  This 'kid' can fight!!

Two words ... and he think he can beat Davis?? Wait that’s 7 word . Lol
Tank would destroy this kid.
Ryan isn't comfortable with southpaw had it been orthodox he wound have even a great of a highlight,and imma shakur fan and doesn't mean I have to hate this kiddo
Commentator compared this to the Hopkins-Delahoya bodyshot, this was much clearer and more gruesome. In slowmo you can see Campbell's body deform due to the transfer of energy.

Thats the same way Luke dropped Teo sparring
His life is like a anime story, right now the protagonist fighter is challenged with a seasoned fighter in preparation for wars against the top tier fighters. Such as Gervonta Davis and Devin Haney and Teofimo Lopez. Can't wait for what's next Anime Warrior. King 👑 Ryan for life!
When Ryan got knocked down, it was like a mirror on how Pacquiao was knocked down vs Marquez

Imagine the next fight Ryan vs Gervonta and Floyd vs Canelo in ringside
Cocky, flat footed kid had the first taste of getting knocked down. Wish it humbled him a lil bit. Or if it didn't, I wish a power puncher will catch him clean with the same overhand left and knocks him out once and for all. Cocky kid, nothing proven yet but hypes himself a lot.

If Campbell dropped Garcia, then Gervonta Davis will just smear him on the ring floor!

At 2:56 If Campbell throws a looping left hook upstairs instead of to the body, this fight is a whole different outcome. It was pretty much the same setup he used to get the knockdown. Don’t know why he didn’t apply more pressure.

King Lion=King Ryan
So he threw most of his shots to the head making his opponent read his punches on purpose so when he stepped in with that hook it looked as if it was going to the face so his opponent lifted his guard leaving his stomach wide open.
Garcia celebrated like rocky did when he beat Drago.🤦🏾‍♂️
我在昆明时一位熟识的女孩，初中毕业就从农村到昆明打工。别人能偷懒就尽量偷个懒，她却一点滑头都耍不来。到哪家打工，都是当自家的事做。那期间在一家小超市打工，老板为了揽生意，时不时的印些小广告，安排超市的几位女孩上街派发。那几位女孩上街溜了一圈，就回租住的房间打牌。还邀她一起回去。她这人心眼特实，这种事干不出来。每每一个人拿着广告纸，在街边从早发到晚，总是晒得黑不溜秋的回来。  所以她不管到哪儿打工，老板都喜欢她，将店里的钱财帐目放手给她管。没多久就开始当店长，后来又自己开店。一个农村女孩，出来十来年时间，就在昆明买房定居了。当年跟她一起上班的那几个女孩，至今还在联系着，一个个还在东一头西一头地打着工，拿点微薄的工资。几年时间，就天差地别了。人生看似充满偶然与戏剧性，实际上，当年躲在房间打牌与站在街头发广告时，后面的人生之路就已经现出端倪了。  在《王凤仪言行录》中也有一则类似的事例。王凤仪先生年轻在周姑父家扛活时，与打头的王老四一起锄地。王凤仪先生干活不惜力气，锄得特别细致。而王老四马马虎虎的、草草了事。过了些天再看，王凤仪先生锄过的地，苗子长得又黑又壮，王老四锄过的又黄又细，一垅高一垅低。到秋天打的粮，就差的更多了。王老四对他说：“我看你还是马马虎虎算了，管他草多草少，打得粮食多少，反正我们为挣工钱是真的。”王先生说：“你想错了，我才是真挣着了，你赔得多啊！”  当时王老四不理解这话的意思。王凤仪先生说：“你的工价比我多一倍，我做的活多，你做的活少，就是我有余，你不足了。（你这样）对自己是亏了良心，对东家是不忠，对老天爷是亏了天理。若是为做活时不尽力，亏了这许多道，我可不干！”  三十年后，这话不幸应验了。那时王凤仪先生在东三省办义学，已是名满天下。那次他在朝阳火车站下了车，当地戴县长同许多人在车站欢迎。当年打头的王老四，也在人群里看热闹。他一看是王凤仪先生，便挤出人群对他说：“你不是王老二吗？”王凤仪先生说：“是啊！老打头的你好啊？”他说：“好什么，现在连扛活都没人用了，还打什么头，天天卖零工度命。你可真好了！”王凤仪先生说：“我不是现在好的，咱们俩一起铲地时，我就好了。当年我和你讲的话，你还记得吗？”同样是这些道理，当时完全听不进去。等历尽一世艰辛，再明白过来时，已经是迟暮之年。  按语： 生活就是这样的，付出了就会有回报。耍滑头偷懒的，看似占了便宜，实则吃了大亏。对因果有信心，就不要因为自己的付出而耿耿于怀。天之道，从来都是在无形中达到动态平衡的。付出的少而得到的多，福报就是在消耗与衰减过程；付出多而收获少，福报则是在潜增暗涨过程。福田无处不在，根子就在当下的起心动念之中。
wasn't he up on 10?
Ryan Garcia is what champs are made of.
Oh I was so sad when he got knocked down
I happy he got dropped....that would probably inspire him to work on his defense. Cos, he may not get let off if he gets dropped by Haney, Lopez or Tank
Video is very nice i like it
Still 1# trending
Now haters can shut up :)
Garcia only has hands no kind of head movement, footwork negligent and zero defense.. he fights like no on else is throwing punches... Finding a next fight for him will be tuff
SO ESTOS PAQUETES LOGRAN TIRARLO CUANDO PELEE CONTRA BOXEADORES DE VERDAD VA A ESTAR EN PROBLEMAS
American commentators are awful. Barely any commentary about what’s going on in-between the ropes and so biased all the time.
Wow wow wow.Garcia ready
Canelo approves with the 3G body shot
Aloha from hawaii.
Love how respectful these  two are in the ring.
i thought Luke is like 10 years younger then actually is
Ricardo Mayorga would KO Rhino Garcia! 🤛🏾
Congratulations Ryan for your first time knock down experience, next fight you will experience your first loss by k.o
🥊🥊🥊🥊
I bet on over 6 rds ko garcia so I'm pleased I won €8 and that's what matters most
What a baby face cambell i  thought he just only 25 yrs old
Garcias face after he nearly got knocked out Was priceless. Pretended like it was nothing. What a savage. I'm a big fan now.
Next vashily lomachenko
I think King Ry is not yet ready for Tank!
Hecshowed hart got dropped came backnfights kinda like Oscar did
U
Best weapon against Southpaws… the left hook. Learnt that from one of MMA's greatest knockouts: Michael Bisping vs Luke Rockhold.
Rayan is 21 and people are talking about he makes rookie  mistakes lol. He's 21 he hasn't even finished developing and he's made it this for he'll befine

Ni porque lo bajaron le dio por tener algo de humildad al pobre ryan, en esta pelea se le noto que aun le falta mucho por trabajar, movimiento de cintura, reflejos y sobre todo no tirar a lo loco cuando obvio debes enfocarte y pensar, por suerte el men tiene pegada fuerte pero no siempre ganara asi, debe aprender a ser mas conciente y dejar las tirada de mierda

Ryan was the bigger, stronger and faster fighter. He has skills but I find his attack is predictable and Luke Campbell knew when to put his gloves up to block the shots. Ryan weakness is he isn't the best counter puncher. In comparison Canelo is amazing when he fought a similar fighter   Liam Smith liked to go into a defensive shell and put his gloves up. All fight Liam Smith was blocking shots then when Liam threw his first punch out of his defensive shell Canelo countered him.
Ryan Garcia vs tank Davis next😎

Should have gotten up and taken another knee to stay in the fight
Yk, it always seems like no fighters can find that even middle. They are either too aggressive and leave themselves way to open, or too defensive and leave them liable to not throwing in their own hits for points. I’ll praise the day i see a new up and coming fighter find that even median.

These highlights do not show how flawed garcias footwork is. He constantly lost outside leverage and was getting hit clean (not highlighted). He also wasnt using his power hand to make Campbell pivot much and help him create better angles.  Garcias game plan was to flurry and hope something connected. It did and he was the winner.  Great young fighter with a bright future but what i saw is that he isnt ready for Davis. Not saying he never will be

Anyone who's been hit with that body shot knows how miserable it feels. It completely rattles your liver and shuts everything down. The heart is willing, but the body simply will not allow you to recover.

I see some heart & a lil punching power, but he's  kinda stiff and not much on defense.  Bobbing, weaving & rolling with a punch is not in his skill set yet.  If he can add some of that, it  could be interesting. Oscar De Lahoya said Canelos gotta watch out for this guy, but he didn't  say when.  I'm  thinking after Canelos been retired for a few years, or more.

Waste of money match
Una pequeña gran dosis de humildad no le caería mal a Ryan.
Once again DAZN commentators biased for their "popular fighters" only. This is why I can't stand watching DAZN. Just mute the sound and watch the fight. Way better.

Haha duck a garcia
Campbell let Garcia won. Or is it the promoter? 🤔🤔🤔😂😂😂😂
Kid have serious problems with southpaw. Ryan's problem in this fight was hes foot work. Replay the match and pay attention to that. You will understand why he got knocked down and it will happen again with any other southpaw. Better fix that boy you will get hurt by someone other than that. The kid is a freaking beast.
Hey wait this isn't a soup commercial at all....
Algún comentario en español? 🤔
What a clean left hook to the body! Made it look like it was to the head then just dipped low.
Pacman needs to beat campbell first and he has to knock him out before dreaming to fight garcia.

Campbell’s legs so skinny it bothers me
7:13 sealed the deal!
7:36 GET THE TABLE AND HELP ME SUPLEX HIM
Well if Ryan got a knockdown in mma,his done but well it's boxing so congrats
NOPPAOAOWOW9
Ryan garcia is the best,i hope canelo support you.
2:39 jajajajajajaja
When you captured the queen early  but couldnt finish the game strong.
I heard Campbell lost bc his walkout costume was 200 pounds and plus racism
If Ryan Garcia will get like that punch from Uzbek boxers he will sleep long time )))
People can go watch this but restaurant owners can’t feed people without freezing them in the street? Wow
What an electric fight!!!!
What if young pacquiao and ryan matched up
well garcia just made a erasable history he got knock 😂
Jolie combat !
Thumbs up to Ryan but Davis will eat up Ryan’s chicken legs up like if he was at church’s
Floyd may weather should coach Ryan for proper defense
I was actually surprised that Ryan was knocked down like that
2:40 En ese momento vinieron los golpes normales consecutivos de Ryan Garcia
Garcia would get slept against davis, he has no chin past 140 and would probably take his first L at 140 🤣
This was ryan garcia's acid test
Go show love on my yt channel
Tank going to destroy Ryan!
That happened when you have overconfidence,  every fighter its a potential contender and dangerous so get focus and dont made the same mistakes.  Other than that his a great warrior
Esto sí es boxeo y peleas no como  las de (canelo) que están de flojera
Bruh... Im a fan of Ryan garcia. But I just don't understand why Campbell didn't attack when he knocked Ryan down. That punch would have probably resulted in unconsciousness for 80% of boxers, so big props to Ryan for regaining composure.  But Campbell being the fighter who has more experience with elite competition shouldn't have let Ryan come back from that.  Great fight for Ryan though,  he proved his critics wrong in this fight.
Asi le quería pelear a teofimo lopez. .. si Teo le pega esa derecha ese Gil d Ryan no se levanta mas
This is boxing! Forget about Mayweather
That's a handful of broken ribs for the Brit.
How can you say this fight is great? It is a joke! Go see Argüello-Escalera fight or Duran-De Jesus, etc. See the difference.!
Can someone tell me why Luke made that face at 2:51?
Amazing? García doesn’t know how to jab! The most elementary punch in boxing. Just wait he fights a real man!
Imagine at 4:19 Campbell landed the same shot
Garcias Chin
one of garcia's posse is a B
Hit that mexican boi
Por eso somos mexicanos    Like si eres Mexicano
Nice left hand of humility.
I hope his liver is okay after that blow
I see what trick Ryan Garcia used
มึงก็โหดเกิ๊น
And they think he can beat Gervonta Davis? Ok
Stay humble kid ...dont party ...dont drink n drug.....stay Training Garcia...Congrats on your win
Campbell fortunate for that body shot because if this went any further Garcia would’ve taken a decade off this scrubs life
Eddie Hearn told it was a terrible decision for García!
He needs to work on his defense, he's tough though but sloppy, Gervonta will expose him if he doesn't improve.
This man won an interim boxing world title, which i can understand from the way boxing works means literally nothing and acted like he just unified the actual titles
señor riflazo .ni tyzon se pararia de ese bomvazo

no to paquaio garcia 🤣🤣🤣
Lomachenko wasn't droped by Campbell as Garcia was.
The slomo on that body shot was intense!
When will Ryan Garcia fight Dennis MacCann? or they will keep putting fighters who can not beat him.....
Waktunya  melawan gervonta , seru pastinya 👍
Excelente manera de levantarse de la lona al triunfo 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Don’t get me wrong but Garcia did stand his grounds.🤙🏼 for a young bro climbing a ladder that fast. Hang on🤙🏼808 states🙌🏼
García igual de egocentrico como siempre
Todavia no me explico porque Campbell no trato de kquearlo cuando lo derribo... me parece bastante raro 🧐
amir khan 2.0
Rematch. He didn't dominate luke. Rather watch a rematch then watch an easy ko from davis or haney
Number one on trending by the way
Un completo,desconocido lo sentó de culito.
Así o más comprada la pelea ?
🇵🇭👍🍻
García no sirve
Min 7:10 de na da 😎✌🏽✌🏽✌🏽
Garcia was true to his word, he will knock out Campbell from a body shot.
Kung si tank davis ang maka tama sayo ng solid tulog ka talaga
Watch 7:38 in slower playback speed
Knock outs in MMA are just knock downs in boxing... I'm pretty sure Garcia was out for a second
Hi
Javier fortuna won easy
Ryan Garcia vs Gary Russell Jr should be his next fight."
Clean liver shot
Jajajajajajajaja somos los mejores jajaja
He is not ready for tank Davis. He got dropped way to easy.
Cashapp $quickmoneynate any donations are greatly appreciated
An amazing body shot takedown.........the kids got power and stamina................................
despues de ver esta pelea solo pienso que ojala nunca le toque a ryan pelear con gervonta porque le acabara la carrera, gervonta lo noquearia y horrible.
Now imagine Gracia taking a Left from Tank .
Imagine if tank K.O Clown Garcia
2:39The same punch that knockdown Pac in PAC VS. Marques 4
It was more than just a win for Ryan. Now he knows what to do when things take a turn! Much respect to both!
luka doncic watching?
Fake
Al mejor estilo de Roberto manos de piedra Dura 🇵🇦
No social distancing in crowd it only takes one to spread it but we creating millions lol
If Garcia fights like this against Davis, he’s going to get his head knocked off.
This is a perfect example on why Davis will destroy Garcia in the first couple rounds
Fight kambosos that would be interesting
When little Timmy found a way To give the world a call- He knew precisely what to say, And what he’d tell them all.  An asteroid was about to hit, But only Timmy knew- The safest way to love through it, And what they’d have to do  And so he slowly sipped his cup, And spoke with hope and pride- But little Timmy f*cked it up  And everybody died
Ryan is a rising star. Won’t take that from him.  But he was sloppy and careless against Campbell. Tank would knock him out with ease. 🤷🏻‍♂️
garcia fights too immaturely resulting in sloppy plays really hard to watch
Ryan literally made him bow to him for that knock down, "no pappi, no more!"
DAT BODY SHOT..
Somehow I went from my little ponies to this
If Luke did him that way imagine what tank will do with his left 🔥
Totally fake, the punch was in the ribs,
What a match, great boxers!
Great work by Ryan Garcia, but he has a couple more fights to toughen up if he wants to face Gervonta Davis.
The able grade selectively rob because flood prenatally calculate toward a gaudy toilet. smoggy, ceaseless hydrogen
Ryan Garcia is trash 🗑
Very few combinations from Garcia
FIGHT INUOE AND YOU WILL SEE WHAT IS BOXING 🤣
hasta que le metieron la mano a García, se creía intocable, será por eso que terminó llorando. Muy sobradito, ya era tiempo de que sintiera la pegada para que sea mas serio. En el boxeo no se puede ser tan pedante, pues son golpes lo que uno recibe y el sintió esa mano fuerte en el rostro..
So there are lots of experienced boxers in the comment section 😂😂...
Though Ryan Garcia won in this fight i always remember his knocked down by Campbell. I found Ryan Garcia now only an another clown in boxing. His next Amir Khan, glass chin.
Jesus Christ loves you all so much!! 🥺❤️
Who else looked in the corner at the round time when the bell went off at 0:57 to see the quickest round ever
Luke Campbell started to get tired throughout the fight breathing hard after Knocking down Ryan Garcia , Ryan came back like a true champion with a KO
Pónganle uno más chingon, le ponen puro pendejo.
no wonder dazn keep posting Ryan he gets them all the views, another million views today, dats crazy
Tank would k.o. this kid he ain't ready yet
Do they always make their own sound effects
YESSIR RYAN LOVE YA
Lofi boom bap and interdimensional sounds on my page, check it out 🖖
All these guys need to fight each other Teofimo lopez beat loma Gervonte davis beat Leo Santa Cruz  Devin haney beat gamboa Now ryan beat luke No excuses they all in they twenties and should fight each other now thats the oy way they will be a floyd mayweather or a canelo level
龴
‼️ IF YOU WANT TO BE THE BEST VERSION OF YOURSELF ROCK WITH MY CHANNEL IF NOT JUST KEEP SCROLLING‼️
Seems the fight was fixed
Ryan is not a skill fighter he don’t hold that title fight this generation is bored compare to fighter back in the days that where the real legend are now this age & time peoples just trap hand n block n attack not even worth to call professionals boxer fight now.
Ryan garcia more exciting to watch than Canelo
Canelo, andale y enseña al pollito Ryan como defenderse mejor. Que izquierdazo le dio el Ingles. Tengo miedo por el.
You can tell Campbell has a lot of heart and really wanted to get up but sometimes your body just won't let you.
This video doing numbersssss
Man... just seeing that body shot makes me nauseous. To anybody who’s never been punched in the liver, it’s like being kicked in the balls and having the wind knocked out of you at the same time. And it has that slight delayed reaction like a shot to the nuts
This is my 10th time watching this.
Garcia got a taste of that canvas!!!!!
Beautiful resistance and discipline by Garcia at 5:13.
Let’s gooo Ryan
PACQUIAO SIGNATURE by campbell..
Este muchacho Ray García puede ser un gran boxeador,y gracias a su contrincante vimos una pelea de guerreros,no como otras dónde todo está planeado,donde se es mezquino a la hora de lanzar los golpes...
at least we know now garcia doesn't fold from a knockdown
Bine by Ryan García's tik tok 😎💪
He wouldn’t get up from Devin’s shot.
We're no strangers to love You know the rules and so do I A full commitment's what I'm thinking of You wouldn't get this from any other guy  I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand  Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you  We've known each other for so long Your heart's been aching, but You're too shy to say it Inside, we both know what's been going on We know the game and we're gonna play it  And if you ask me how I'm feeling Don't tell me you're too blind to see  Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you  Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you  (Ooh, give you up) (Ooh, give you up) Never gonna give, never gonna give (Give you up) Never gonna give, never gonna give (Give you up)  We've known each other for so long Your heart's been aching, but You're too shy to say it Inside, we both know what's been going on We know the game and we're gonna play it  I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand  Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you  Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you  Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
I weigh the same and am the same height as Ryan but I’m skinny asf somehow
🥊
HE’S ASKING QUESTIONS😂
Crazy
Jesus christ , and this boy garcia wants to fight Gervinta Davis , you gotta be kidding me ... after see the fight of leo santacruz vs gervonta ... i just can thick this boy garcia and his week defense will be soo wrong to put him against a killer like gervonta
I think tank kos him
I’m actually so glad he got knocked down now he knows he’s not invincible
Kid needed a test . He got one, and passed
Julio César Chávez # one
Someone was bound to hit with that hook his face is always open
This man Ryan is 22, this man Luke got 11 years of more experience than him. Ryan’s work ethic is astonishing.
Ryan learn so much from this match
I want to watch more ryan fml
Ryan García🇲🇽💗
Hmm
Reading these comments, I don't think Ryan could have done anything to please the hardcores who simply don't like him.
Tank knocks him out. This fight just exposed him he has so many flaws that he will forgot to fix one like planting his feet keeping his chin up no defense at all it makes who he just a future amir kahn
Garcia vs davis
The difficulty is really the opponent of the left
Huge props to Ryan man is climbing the ranks
Props to Ryan for getting back up.
FIGHT ME!
Y asi quieren pelea contra tank garbonta dudo que aguante 3 raund
Que un real mexicano le parta su madre a garcia....  es un gran boxeador pero 0 humilde y demasiado arrogante...
He’s not ready for tank
Garcia wanted Pacquiao,  Pacquiao -- wait kid, hold my beer
Beautiful fight
ryan got a lot of work to do if he wants to fight loma
Roy Jones jr  vs Virgil hill knockout
That kid throws left hooks so nasty i gotta learn how to throw that
So many boxing experts in this comment section
These fights are all fake
Johnriel Casimiro is waving .
Lol 😂 how much they pay the white boy to go down you can see this Garcia doesn’t have weapons to compete
5:34 This Kid Just a Walk in the Park with the Defense Blocking Heavy Blows from Ryan Garcia Ultra Instinct 🙌🏾
This shows how amazing of a fighter Ryan garcia really is
2:39  Con esa mandíbula de cristal, no tendrá oportunidad en contra de Davis
I hate to talk bad but i'm not seeing any talent.
I did not expect to see Ryan get knocked down
What a dog
So that’s considered a knock out ?
🤔
Pinche inflado no tre nada
So this kid wants to fight the legendary Manny Pacquiao?
the fact this is #1 on trwnding
Even his spleen felt that..
Nice fight 👍
Now Campbell is the fool who thought he could beat Ryan Garcia. This situation reminded me of Achilles from Troy. Ryan Garcia has incredible heart and was not going to let this go.
Garcia is the best and luke campbell one the best boxing sportmanship
This is basically speed vs strength
Incredible fight.
Garcia is the real deal but Campbell definitely showed that he has a lot of developing to do yet.
Round 3 proves ryan is not ready for gervonta mind blowing left hook... wow this kid went downnnnnnn imagine a bigger tougher faster fighter landing that imagine getting hit by the “tank” lights out.
Orang indonesia mana jarinya..?
Ahahah why campel not move in the body shot? he have time to see what's is coming...
Oo teri bhai Kasuta khiladi hai yo to bhai

Claw García
Young people taking over boxing
Anybody notice how the round was ending in 5 seconds @ 5:05 but when he gave luke that left hook its like they purposely gave him extended time. Find a better relationship than goldenboy and the judges 💀
A high pressure boxer puncher will beat Ryan pretty comfortably.
CAMPBELL LACKED THE TENACITY. HE COULD'VE WON IF HE WAS A LIL MORE CONFIDENT
King cristal 😂😂😂
I just want to see him vs Gervonta Davis
Campbell literally let Ryan waltz out of that second round. When you drop someone that decisively you go after them to put their light out. He literally just let Ryan catch his breath for the rest of that round. 0 pressure was applied after the knockdown! He deserved to lose that.
Ow 7:14 that’s gonna hurt
Great fight
Canelo 2 le ponen puro bulto o cartucho quemado
Me caga
Donkey ryan
Talk about a ending
Incoming ryan garcia hate even though he just beat who u guys said he couldn't.
too live crew in the house, after the vaccine !
The biggest mistake for Luke was not going after Ryan when Ryan was hurt Luke would of won EZ.
I’m hoping that knockdown will help him understand that getting distance with only your hands and not knowing when to check punches will only get you so far in boxing.
Ryan was too open. should've known better and closed up. He knows we're in a pandemic. Lol
He is always open and He wants to fight PACQUIAO? really??
I love how everyone is an expert in the YouTube comment section!! Lol.
Tank davis will humble Garcia
Garcia is the king
olha o hercules Puga aqui de novo, já já vem video novo!!
Dropped
I never noticed until the commentators pointed it out how flat footed garcia does fight.  May need to work on that, but I dont know the most about boxing.
What a body shot!
🇲🇽👌
Canelo new at that point that he has to go back to work
lol told ya it was bound to happen
Valeu Ryan, tamo junto camarada.
Amazing fight... Campbell se comió ese golpe al hígado por no pegar la guardia al cuerpo en el último momento, un pequeño error que fue más peligroso. La guardia se respeta en todo momento hasta en el cansancio...
Keymbell😂
Bro if Luke kept pressure after he knocked down Ryan it could of been a whole different story tbh
Hoy lo vi muy apagado a ryan él podía dar más pelea
משחק האיגרוף הזה היה מדהים🟦⬜🟦⬜🟦⬜🟦
Ryan practices that body shot like it’s the only the he knows!  Goes the saying, in the MMA world!   I rather practice 1 move a 1000 times   Than to learn 1000 moves 1 time !!!
Hahahahah iyak ka ka Paquao PRE wagmo hamunin
Fvji jjj jus on bbb
cca sonne comme Bob Lenon
Sorry but my first time seeing him get punch down thoooo
Hi
Yikes someone with fast feet like loma would dance around Ryan lol
Ryan garcia no foot work and you can look at his eyes and tell he ain’t hungry he just on the clout chasing
Gervonta Davis sleeps this kid in the 2nd round
Garcia will not get up if caught clean by Davis..can’t wait for this fight!!!
Campbell should of went after him when knocked him down but didn't payed the price for it
I think I can take Jake Paul in a fight !!
New Youtube Channel! Subscribe to me! :)
Ryan is tooo cocky he got knocked down and humbled but luckily he cleaned up his mess
U
0:55 I've never watched anything like this before but are there legs always this skinny.
I was not expecting Ryan to try Hit like dat
Niceeeee, Ryan The Best..
21-0 and only 22 years old! This kid is something special. Only needs to work on his defense and he’s unstoppable in his division.
I don't see nothing special here!
He is not ready!
Caught him with that canelo deceptive left hook
You could see just watching it that when he went for the body shot jabs the second time he did it he knew his guard was coming down you could tell that left hook was coming sooner or later I don’t know why he wasn’t thinking that that’s what he would do
DO NOT INVEST IN THE CURRENT BITCOIN PUMP-N-DUMP!!!!
Looks pretty familiar 👀
this garcia guy really is overhyped - i know he won but cmon..
2:37
Ryan isn’t ready for tank 😭
that's called a investment punch
I like Ryan and i picked him to win this fight, but Tank sleeps him if they fight next.
Camera on Canelo after that Liver shot. Just perfect. Can't say the student isn't learning from the master. Hope Ryan grows into another Canelo. Ofc he's nowhere near that yet. But he still young
ALGUIEN QUE NO HABLE TAKATAKA
Thank s
Ryan used the same signature move that Canello always uses — the deceptive left hook that comes from down below that can land either up top or to the body.
Campbell had the technique and the power but the absence of killer instinct
sa wakas nakatikim ka rin king
2:35 and 7:10
All the boxing professors in the comments that never made it pro
Body left hook straight out of the Canelo/Cotto/Micky Ward textbook.
That knockout  insane. That comeback insaner
Like si quieres ver la revancha
Cowboys Stadium next
Garcia could rival Haney and Stevenson but I don't think he's at Davis, Loma or Lopez's level. Stacked division. Seems to like to stand stock still, flat-footed and feet wide apart. That's something he needs to iron out. Campbell not known for being a big puncher but caught him clean with ease. Shown a vulnerability there.
With that footwork. Garcia won't stand a chance with a counter puncher
Ikaw hahamon Kay Pacquiao sisiw ka pa boy
Hey si ati que leíste esté comentario Dios te bendiga grandemente🙏🏼♥️
He need to fight tank davis garcia will het knocked out
5:04 Dejaron correr la pelea por 10 segundos mas
anyone else who thinks ryans hands were faster in previous fights ?🤔
Don't lie Ryans first knockdown felt satisfying!! Lol
He is a great fighter but let's be real he is not ready for davis...or Heney or even Shakur stevenson...Luke just showed a weakness to every boxer watchinnthis fight so ryan better get focused on his defense more...great body shot though...he PAUSED like Campbell he knew he couldnt take another shot
This was coming soon or later for Ryan and he clearly is going to learn
Pac-Man will destroy this two guys
SOBREVALORADO
King Ryan was always going to win this, Epic body shot. King Ryan is stronger & also smarter than his 11 year older opponent. SHOCK THE WORLD BABY
Ryan Garcia better step up his game. He got exposed this fight even though he won.
You’re too young to face Pacquiao, just enjoy your career first and try to fight him on your 40’s so you can now have the upper hand on Pacquiao on his 60’s 😂
Dazn really need UK commentators. US commentators are just not the same...
Ryan’s not used to fighting a lefty haha
Garcia's corner: Canelo Alvarez, Oscar De La Hoya, Bernard Hopkins. That's just ridiculous.
There were fans on this one
Campbell Give the blueprint to beat garcia and to next opponent of garcia they only need to built it
How can boxing allowed fans to come in but not UFC and other sports
Garcia vs Loma next?
Here we go Tonight all the monsters gonna dance We're comin' to get you! Tonight all the monsters gonna dance We're comin' to get you! If you're only dreaming Why I hear you screaming? Tonight all the monsters gonna dance We're comin' to get you! We're comin' to get you!
Something's pulling me It's so magnetic My body is moving Unsure where I'm headed All of my senses have left me defenseless This darkness around me Is promising vengeance The price that I'm willing to pay is expensive There's nothing to lose When you're lonely and friendless So my only interest is showing this princess That I am the queen And my reign will be endless (endless)
Ladies and gentlemen.. the amir khan here 😂
I never thought of myself as mean I always thought that I'd be the queen And there's no in between 'Cause if I can't have that Then I would be the leader of the dark And the bad Now there's a devil on my shoulder Where the angels used to be And he's calling me the queen of mean (calling me, calling me) The queen of mean (calling me, calling me) The queen of mean (calling me, calling me)
Campbell didnt fight well and smart like he did against Loma (even he lost, he had the right plan). He had to fight Ryan the same way - keep him going backwards, keep pressure on and take away those fast combos and power shots. He spent the fight trying to time Ryan instead of pressure to force misses and openings. You dont want a guy like Ryan coming forward, you want him on his heels. If you give him time... he'll do what he just did!
KAPOW!!
i don't mean to be offensive but how is this entertaining
I could punch you right here right here!!!
7:39 oooooof that hurt
I thought Ryan Garcia was finished after the knockdown but he proved me wrong. What an entertaining and intense match between these two boxers.
احتاج دعم اتفضلوا قناتي I need support to my channel  Thx
Insane if he masters his defence
I'm glad someone knocked down Garcia.
I didnt like garcias arrogance when he had campbell on the ropes. I hope someone bangs him out clean.
Big pay day
That knock down woke Ryan Garcia up.
Garcia rely more on his hand speed and power. He has to work more on his defense and footwork. What more if he  face a more Preasure fighter.He's not ready for Tank and Lopez.
Nice fight 👌
The point of boxing is to hit and not get hit, Ryan is a dog for his age but he has to learn defence as well... Hes only gonna get better believe me!! If that boxer was smart he would've let his left go..
Not gone have dat mulch time u to sloppy 😂
Gracia was lucky, if he didn't hit that shot he would lose on points. Campell on another level, very technical
пизд..ц
Terminando la era del canelo el será el futuro del boxeo
Stop changing him fa he do sum permanent
As someone who only watches MMA this boxing match was amazing
But I think Ryan broke his rib u see that replay
Ryan needs to study canelos high guard he reaches for punches when defending instead of staying in the pocket
Not beating tank🤣
At some angles it looks like Ralph Macchio  vs Luke Campbell.
¿Dónde están los mexicanos?😳
He should be staying well away from Tank.
Unas ganas de saber ingles para leer los comentarios :(
Creo que García está muy pollito todavía para pelear con cualquiera de los actuales campeones..sería una canallada porq es un muchacho joven q tiene un buen futuro pero no no no..le falta mucho  por aprender.. De que es bueno sin duda lo es pero arriba hay unos monstruos destructores...
Ryan Gacia needs to work on his footwork..He has the power but no footwork...Tank or Teofimo can beat his a$$ easy..
Amazing fight!! Both fighters are great at what they do. This is the boxing I miss
WHO IS FROM 2015 LIKE
My face when Garcia fell :😯
Campbell lacks fire. He could have it in round two.
Haha Ryan aint gonna win vs  lomachenko, tank davis  and teofimo with a flat foot and an open chin like that. But lemme say his power and speed can be a problem.
Salute to Luke Campbell
Respect For and loyal FANS Luke Campbell nice Impressive Fight you given You Get Knockdown By Heavy Left hook in round 2 For Shown Thevweakness of Ryan Garcia Better Luck next Fight Luke Campbell
Luke didn't even look confident even when he knocked Garcia down. You could just tell on his face..
2:37 best moment ever, seeing this trashtalk kid falls is so satisfying !!!
Puro 🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊
Honestly the 4 horsemen meaning Davis Garcia Haney and Lopez. Are amazing but look at lomachenko, nakatani, comment, fortuna, tagoe, kambosos, Isaac cruz. This division is loaded lot of big fights. Also luke Campbell is still there
That fight was so intense I want a rematch
Let’s see the battle of the young boys teofimo Lopez vs Ryan Garcia would be a great fight
Le falta mucho a este chavo, parece estilo callejero en vez de verdadero box.
Can we now stop calling this an election?  By pretending this insurrection is a legitimate democratic process, we're playing into our enemy's hands, giving credence to the lie that a decrepit, corrupt, sickly old man, Joe Biden, has been elected president of the United States.  This is not an election; it's a coup AND YOU ARE COMPLICIT and will be held accountable under US LAW
Was that a liver punch idk much about boxing
No head movements,no footworks.I hope ryan garcia renounce his wish to fight pacman.just saying.😄😄😄
Baw before ur king Campbell baw before king Ryan 👊😁
Watched This Live In Dallas. Ryan Garcia Really Is What He Talks.
Everyone gangsta till covid knocks them both out.
Now Ryan got a taste of a lil loss. He now know she needs patience and movement. Great win tho
El tipo que ganó como que parece dominicano xdd. Alguien me aclara si es o no es, por favor.
Just saying it’s so disrespectful and so disappointing that people were booing Luck
happy new year and happy new speed!  5 day we got 1 million corona virus  infected people! i think 2021 better than 2020!
Campbell’s knockdown was beautiful, but that body shot was picture perfect, no way I’d get up from that. Tough fight
Английский безударный пердун местечковый , с большой печенью
Did anyone remember seeing during  the build up to this fight when Garcia was mocking Cambell for the way he throws that wide looping left hook? Ironic that it was that exact punch that touched him... came back well though.  But Tanks a destroyer... Ryan ain't ready yet...
Had he worked the body early he would have put him away sooner
Dope fight amazing warriors
Amir Kahn vs Ryan gracia
Even verdejo, that sadly is going down on his career, fck this kid up if they fight.
King ry😍
Ryan bunches looks like a horse kicking 🤣🤣🤣
He's not ready for Tank
This girl is gonna get hurt bad. I see no technics.
Wow Ryan got knocked tf out and came back. Nice
Ryan Garcia Best Man in Boxing 💪
You just got exposed Garcia
Big test kid, you passed.
Wonder why het didn't finish him off? I hate these bought fights.
Commentary was awful
After watching this fight, I can confidently say Tank would easily beat Ryan.
You’ve witnessed his heart plus his speed no one will beat him now. Lookout world his name is RYAN GARCIA.
6:56 García lowers his right hand again. Similarly as the first drop in round 2... Lucky for him that Campbell was aiming for a body shot and not the head. IT could have been ko for Campbell and first lost for Ryan.
"9:36" Feliz de obtener Diamantes *GRATIS* de *FF2.ONLINE**
Not gonna lie I wasn't overly impressed with Ryan Garcia prior to this fight but credit where credit is due, he stepped up in this fight against Campbell who is a solid lightweight that gave Loma and Linares trouble and answered alot of questions. He shown heart overcoming adversity with the knockdown and performed very well in securing the victory. Obviously he needs to work on his defence and I'm pretty sure he'll learn plenty from Eddy Reynoso to refine his craft and make the necessary adjustments for future fights in that regard but overall the kid definitely has a bright future ahead of him.
Thsi is the kind of fights that makes this kid a better fighter and he will continue to grow from this type of fights to continue being the best in his division

Ryan’s first time getting knocked down... he handed it like a champ
I wish someone on the commentary would tell me how pretty Ryan Garcia is again  🙄
Fan of both. Luke is no joke. And Garcia really showed some toughness because that was a really bad knockdown. Possibly worrying, but not sure yet.
To the early squad reading this: sending virtual hugs to everyone who needs it! Stay safe and positive in these difficult times❤     My Dream is to hit 4k, im struggling and trying to make my parents proud The match was 🤯
Luke learned from Loma, Ryan learned from Luke
Nice lesson for ryan garcia haha.
Gotta mash that a button and get up
Did someone else notice the count was off ? He stop counting at 6

RYAN GARCIA KNOCK DOWN ROUND 2
Ожидал большего от молодой звезды Гарсии . Слаб для крутых парней ,его Ломаченко на завтрак сьест
Could’ve been any one of them that won
Who else thought that bell at 1:05 was the round ended
Luke has always boxed on the back foot...he couldnt steam in and finish him off when he went down.Garcia was lucky he couldnt
Imagine if tank davis hit that left hook
just dont let the rematch happen Campbell will take him down even worse he was to focus on cobering hes fave to prevent garcia knocking him out he didnt really cover the body lucky shot garcia
Ryan has mad speed and power u can’t deny the KOs not that easy to knock someone out Campbell is tough to
We have to remember Ryan is still young. A lot fighters are at their best in their late twenties in my opinion. Soon he’ll be able  to have better defences if he puts in the work. He’ll learn from that knockdown
Luke should definetly have attack after knockdown in round two. It looks to me that there was no need to be cautious, cause ryan was wobbly
The way Garcia fell he could’ve broke that arm 😭😂
Ryan's chin will never be the same 💯💯💯
He is tough. But is he really ready for tank ? With defence like this? Will he able to dodge them vicious uppercuts ? Will he able to exert enough pressure, tank moves much faster than campbell and has  better defence too. But that body shot was something.
the british threw it a teofimo lopez disappears in 4 rounds
That liver shot was deadly 😭
Well when tank kos this kid it’ll be sad
Nerf the DMR
When he fights a decent fighter he is ko
It looks painful. (saying it with a mouthful of chips and soda.)
If that was tank or Lopez or even Loma I think Ryan would have seen stars lol
What a left hook to the body props to both fighters. Ryan took that test and persevered
Everyone was saying Ryan Garcia will get knocked out when he fights Campbell but look what happened🤨🤨
Fight tank!!
I see that bodyshot challenge working for ry
Let's be honest ... It's early for him to face Tank or Lopez
Boxing is my sport and I thought cambell was gonna win by round 12...
He 21-0 at like 21 years old imagine what he will finish his career as.
Needs lots of work on that defensive side
Tough to beat watching Gabe Itches fight
the legend lives on!!!
Go with the Filipino fighter
I heard RG is aiming to fight PacMan? Is that true?
2:38 it was the beard.
We're looking at greatness
Garcia is underrated. Man fights bootleg boxers and calls himself king.
luke campbell should have won but he lacked follow up or killer instinct to finish him off on that round plus he is still aware of the power of garcia.
Peleas arregladas  malos los dos
WAIT! everyone write something confusing in the comments so that we can confuse the people that read this AFTER I edit it.l
Hand speed. Amazing
If you really care about Garcia's career keep him away from  Tank and Devin
I so want him to fight jake paul xD
If his defense don’t get better he gonna see the canvas alot
MMA:   NFL  BOX:    MLS
Trump 2020
If Ryan can get his defense to higher level he’ll be lethal. His hands are crazy fast.

Gervonta Davis is coming
Imagine if Tank landed that left hook on him that Campbell landed.. 💀
The commentary 🤢🤢🤢
Cambell gassed out, thats it. Dude literally just gave up a huge win.
7:38 That jiggle though
Canelo said post fight that Ryan didn’t use certain tools he has in his bag, because Ryan wanted to walk him down and was confident Luke wouldn’t take the power, he choose to not listen to Eddie in the corner and he made it exciting but he can box way better and they were impressed by Ryan’s balls but it’s not smart to fight like that...
put me in coach
What do they weight fight night?
Ryan is flat-footed and he will have trouble with those boxers with fast feet. I hope he will learned and work on those footwork if not davis or haney can knock him if not outboxed him. Nonetheless great win and prove his a top contender by overcoming that adversity full credit to him.
Ryan garcia is all hype lol he's not great just average. A fighter with near perfect footwork like lomachenko can destroy Garcia.
That body shot came out of nowhere, so quick and powerful, perfect placement. Luke was never gonna be able to continue.
Only people who didn’t come from tiktok are worthy of liking this comment
What an amazing fight
I cant stop watching. 7:10 the white guy hits the mexican dude with a body shot. Then the mexican dude says FU
Ryan is still learning
This kid Garcia needs to improve a lot if he wants to call out Davis. A slip up like that against a strong puncher will make Ryan see stars quick
Kids got a future.
Speechless
He made Cambell go to sleep with the predictability. He kept jumping in with that left hook upstairs until the last shot ( went downstairs) and caught Campbell by surpise.
Can someone tell me why in boxing matches there is the crowd right now, while in MMA there isn't.  I'm just curious
I don't watch a lot of boxing. At first my reaction was, really? going down from a body shot???....then I saw the slow mo....I felt that
Gayweather putting money on Luke 😂😂😂😂
Many fighters drop their hands to deflect incoming body shots. You can deflect the body shots with the elbows. Protect your face. Keep them hands up. 3:45
2:40 Ryan goes down and 7:14 Luke goes down  You can thank me later
Just ask Logan Paul, ryans body shots are mean!
Ouch 😣
How does 5’9-10” and 135 lbs even exist in competitive sports
That body shot in slow motion was a thing of beauty. It hurt my liver just from watching. I guess that was revenge for hitting him so flush on the chin. Great fight!
Garcia md should target middleweight class he is big for this low weight class
7:35 ...that is all
DAZN needs to give the editor a raise always fast and on point with these highlights
One second i thought that ryan was gonna get cancelled
Campbell muy tibio,como no vas a atacar después de que lo mandaste a la lona.
Been saying this 4 a min. Ryan got no defense he play too loose. If he Can tighten Up on defense he’d be too raw
If Ryan fights a real opponent it can be seriously dangerous for him. As of now he needs to keep fighting these average dudes
MEXICANS LIVES MATTER
your boss your government never want change!  why is that? if you are the boss , do u want change?  so here is one thing we can do we can make change against them! it's rich tax! the only thing we can do against them it's rich tax! now let's do it!
2:37 is what you came for 😎 I wanted Luke to win so badly...
This kid is too fast and accurate
I’ve never watched boxing but this was entertaining!
YES GARCIA💚🤍❤
Puro circo ya
Garcia hit him with the liver shot reminds me of that episode from dexter
Wild fight!!! Could have gone either way. This was Garcia’s best opponent and he could have lost but he won in devastating fashion!
I don't watch boxing but hiw is this a stopage? Dude stood to both feet as ref hit 10. Thought they cld milk that count all the to 10 if they wanted....
Great fight! If your reading this you have to subscribe to my channel, Happy new year🎮
ryan finished him with a liver shot which is one of the worst pains you will ever feel
Everyone was talking trash about Ryan he can't fight now they all quiet 😂😂 on his Instagram
Dear Ryan Garcia, wait 3 years b4 u fight Shakur, Tank, or Haney unless u wanna get ko'd.
That ko in R2 will teach him a lot before he fights someone like tank
Garcia is all power and no chin.  It wont take long before you get humilated.  Mark my word man.
The odd fiction concordantly copy because bathroom reilly poke to a eminent increase. cheerful, ratty cowbell
Amazing potential from Ryan Garcia. He now knows to work more on his defense. In his next fight he will be a monster. So much potential
I nou it
Interesting fight.
Liver
Para esa mierda de Ryan deben ponerle a teofimo o lomachenko para ver si es verdad que sirve es igual que canelo le arreglan todas las peleas pero esos dos si lo van a tirar al escusado donde tiene que estar
Gervonta Davis

You are all calling him kid but much younger Iron Tyson was nightmare :D
03:48 Never seen someone get knocked down like that. He fell like a chicken on its wing.
Was the intro music the same as BLACKED?
Ryan should try fighting loma next after some very hard training
Apenas van 3 días del 2021 y ya es la mejor pelea del año 🔥
Those are some skinny legs...
If Garcia goes looking for tank he is going to get blown up!
Eto ba yung nangangarap lumaban sa pambansang kamao? Walang head movements at flat footed 😂 pera pera nalang talaga Magiging punching bag ka Lang

Why do they always get up on 10? 😆
Garcia = Overrated
👇And that's TRUE👇
🤔ryan en español té lo digo, lo qué mal comienza mal termina, 50 años llevó viendo BOXEO, si comienza la carrera callendo tendrás que cambiar cosas, EGO, para que te vaya bien contigo mismo con tú carrera y emociones🤔=😆😅😅😉  🎖🏅estás cosas se ganan con esfuerzo destreza y dedicación y NO por fingir.
Francis Ngannou is probably beating his chest and  cheering like a girl right now.
Why is tris trind 1
This just proof that Ryan is a very dangerous fighter he gonna learn a lot from this fight and in 10 years when him and Tank  face off he gonna demolished him.
Another win for King ry get in
Somebody is gonna put this kid in his place one day. He does not know how to behave. He’s just fueling his future opponents.
Really if you try Davon now, you'll fall
I like Ryan! If Canelo mentors him, he can dominate that division.
Dang the liver shot was deadly tho!!!
He’s not ready for tank

want to see a rematch..for entertainment
Campbell was so close but he left himself open
Campbell should have doubled the jab to back him up before throwing the left hook.
When Campbell dropped him , why didn't  he follow up when ryan was dazed
Ryan still at work to be a better boxer 💪👊
Soft chin, Ryan. Think it better before fighting to the elite boxers. Campbell has no power in his fists and he knocked you down. You fell like a doll.😂😂
Thank u dazn Ryan is the future
That liver shot hurts so bad. Garcia needed to improve his chin tho. But if Tank landed a clean punch on Garcia’s chin i doubt he’ll be able to get up.
Compradaaaaa
I called it going at least 6
That was 100% the best outcome that could have happened to Ryan.  Nobody should be doubting his skill anymore
Todos mis respetos para estos dos hombres que dieron todo en el ring y nos recordaron un verdadero boxeo
When has anyone ever seen a fighter go from one to two knees and that results in a tko?
Oh Campbell, a few more push.
That body shot hurt
That's a lot of people watching
Wow
Man Luke’s face after that liver shot said it all . I give Garcia a lot of credit he took it right on the chin and got back up and still pressed forward much respect .
ves bsn hyafim
Pelea amañada
That was a great fight
Ruthless body shot
Most of these youtube comments are fake 🤥
After Ryan went down he was all over Campbell. Campbell was looking for another big hit and it just didn’t come
Ouch the liver shot,old  school learn how to heal learn how to injure 👊👊👊🇬🇧🇬🇧
This could be the level Garcia stays at now don't know whether he takes any of the better guys in the division.
Can someone tell me who ryan garcia is
Amazing kid!
No doubt this boy packs power. That was a beautiful body shot. These exciting to watch fighters will bring glory to professional boxing again.
Pure Animal that lad
i just realized that punch was one canelo's weapon. Making opponent thinks that it's a hook to head but nah hahahaha booooom!
Во втором очень повезло что перчаткой развёрнутой попал, хер бы он встал. Ну в целом да не плох, но сыроват этот Гарсия , Джервонта его одолеет)
Come on put em in the ring with some real fighters ryan is so overrated
Need humble like manny
He was throwing that left hook to the head on every round!! This must have been advised from Canelo to drop the hook to the body!! No doubt
Garcia is a very arrogant boxer like most fighters today.
Teofimo wuld eat this kid in 4 rounds
Gervonta davis?
As a Ryan garcia fan I think he is not ready for Davis
Tank Will knock tf out of Ryan García
The little king is not ready for tank or Lopez
Favorite Ko's are with body punches, what a hit.
Garcia aint ready for Gervonta.
Never really watch these but was pretty anticlimactic. Might be interesting for those who know all the technicalities of fighting but I don't see how the average viewer finds this entertaining.
Ryan will NOT go far if he doesn’t work on his footwork! He is WAY too flat footed 😂
pelea vendida, Cambell, la tenia ganada
And he thinks he can beat devin haney 😂😂😂
At 2:39 u wanna watch this part
ohhh wowowowowowowow!! Hits!
Se apendejo el inglés lástima que perdiera!! Ya lo había votado pudo haberlo rematado
And Garcia wants to fight Pacman in the future.
ATTA BOY NEVER GIVE UP
Am late who is here with me  Ryan needs a lot of wrk on his defense
Tiene que volver a nacer rayan garcia para ser boxeador..le falta muchísimo imaginense que todavia no pelio con ningun boxeador..son todos paquetes.. con un buen boxeador lo trituran como hielo..
Garcia lucky not to mess his shoulder or elbow up the way he fell!!
7:39 is the finisher. I wouldn't get up, I would black out.
Bruh that's actually a *NO LOOK BODY SHOT*
Ryan better work on his defense or he's gonna get knocked out with one hard hit by devin or gervonta
Garcia has a bad habit of closing his eyes during punching. He did when he got dropped and watch his YouTube videos he does it a lot  hitting the bag
Who wants GARCIA to Win this?
Shoxjahon Ergashev vs Ryan Garsia. Super boxers
Waiting for ozzy mans review  And "WHEN CELEBRATING EARLY GONE WRONG"
7:35 I'm not homphobic but there should have been a warning
Ryan Garcia fights Logan Paul on my channel
Rayn you are the best I love your boxing man. I wish my son be like you.
Campbell could have had the upper hand in some rounds if he stayed off the ropes but nice job to Ryan!!!!!’
amazing!
Amazing return king kid 💯💪
Dont go fight with TANK yet, u need to work on ur defence and relax, tank will eat u alive hes on another level,
Man the dela hola cartel must of had to pay double for that “body tko”.   Fake
Commentators are 100percent biased but great fight
Wooo Campbell 🔥🔥 Garcia top 🙏
Luke is such a sparring partner knocks ryan down and not even pressing him if i was in his corner i woudlve cussed me
ay alguien latino que hable espeñol
Why's this #1 trending and not actually on the trending page for me?
I feel for Luke. Great fight!
who knows like campbells entrance song?
He could beat Haney right now, but he definitely cant be Spence Jr. or Devonta Davis at this moment without developing better movement and counter punching.
If Ryan Garcia works on his defense he will be the best fighter in the World. His offense in my eyes is the best I seen in Years even better than Trinidad, and Oscar De La Hoya. That defensive thing he does by stretching his arms out and jumping back takes away from him being able to counter punch. He needs to learn how to swing left and right while bending his knees. This will not only allow him to avoid punches but he will be able to swing into that left hook he loves either to the body or head.
Great fight - super happy Dazn showed at a time us UK fans can also watch live too ✌️
Ngl the fastest body shot I've seen 😮😮
Ryan has got to work on his defence if he’s to go near the world titles. Flat footed, hands low after firing.
I think tank beats him
Jesus Christ died for our sins gg
People dont realise how big Ryan is. He's almost 6ft tall and if he takes his time in matchmaking he will be too big and strong for a lot of these guys in the lightweight to welterweight divisions
Luke's stance was great, he's doing like Loma's hand position and how he hops
2:38 where is replay?!?!  there is 3:26
Luke should of jumped on him after the knockdown
2:35  RYAN GARCIA
Tank is going to detach this kids head from his body.
Ref called it a second early no?
Looked rigged! If a fighter stands up before the ten count the ref shouldnt be able to wave the fight!
Who tf body shots now bruh it’s a boxing match wouldn’t a KNOCKOUT satisfy you more ? All love in the end.
I really dont think hes that great. He is a above average fighter but not great like Canelo
Everyone talking about that body shot but no one talked about the opportunities Ryan opened to other fighters that he is not unstoppable if anything this fight exposed him.
what if manny land that left solid shot on u? ull wake up tommorow.
He will get so much better !
Amir Khan 2 .. thats nor really powerful over righthand but you KO
Cambell skipped leg day their so skinny
Probably Ryan Garcia forgots that he ain't at Instagram at that time he got knocked down
And he still want pacquiao fight ? 😆
After i saw that slow-mo liver shot punch, I was just like "That's a getting shot by shotgun experience right there"
Campbell gotta give ryan his gold medal after this
Lol why does ryan feel like the main character in an anime
7:11 that's why you don't mess with Ryan
Davis will finish you kid 💀☠
Ryan really said *"IG BODYSHOT CHALLENGE!"* and it ended up working. Great fight by Luke, nonetheless!
Garcia seems to be that bully, very offensive type boxer. High risk, high reward. I can see him losing in the future.
Ok ok.   Ryan is earning my respect little by little.   Great fight.
Campbell should have been all over him after that knockdown. Just let em go man!
As a Latino I would root for Garcia. But as a 33 year old, I am at Campbell's corner.
I was really dissapointed in Campbell.  He just let Ryan gain confidence round by round. I think the knockdown made him complacent.
The way they grabbed Ryan after the win 😳😂😂
if this kid ryan fights tank...im betting my house on tank..
he was in dallas yesterday? he had a fight? i’m so behind
I know the move of campbell,  right jab, then lefthook,  from manny pacquiao moves,,  😂😂😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Гарсия никакой и держалка у него никакая
It's crazy how campbell got rite up after the 10 count hmmmmm....????
So basically Ryan hit him right in the diaphragm and replaced the oxygen in his lungs with the speed force.
when he hit him with that body shot...i knew it.dude wasn't too bad either; had that first knockdown at least; if he had stayed on him...? might have been a quicker night
Ryan exposed ?  Nah . He taking defence potion next
This Ryan Garcia everytime he hits his defense is absolutely gone... and his footwork also looks a little rigid
K
i feel bad for campbell
POV: you clicked on it bc it was 1 on trending
This is a setup fight...LOL
🤴🥊
Garcia needs more bobbing and head movements. He can't win against Loma, Tank and Pacquiao with a steady head. Its more like target practice for the more elite fighters.
Ryan is great, I love watching him fight however it pains me watching his defence, who am I to say anything though him and his team know best, Campbell exposed his vulnerability with his defence which I why I worry for future Garcia fights, I’m sure him and his team will work on that
That kid is special. Both are great champions.
Why get up at 10 seconds he may as well of stayed down for a minute or so
very cool!!!

Why is there a crowd smh
Bien hecho muchacho, muchos te criticaran porque canelo esta junto a ti, pero sigue adelante, disfruta tu victoria
Something loma couldn’t do...
Everyone keeps talking about the post fight celebration, but in every other sport you got guys slapping each other's butts and taking showers together. Smh
Campbell Telegraph’s his punches and will never beat any body of note if he doesn’t fix that bs. He throws a left but right before drops his right hand to the ground basically. Held his right elbow in the sky like a 20’s fighter. C’mon! Threw zero check hooks and it seems like it’s because he doesn’t have the coordination or skill to. Kid should study Pacquiao or something.
Before this fight we all know how this kid is fast but now we know how this kid is tuff 💪💪💪. Congratulations
Youre planning to challenge Pacman with that Moves? Hahahaha.. Aim according to your skills not to your Mouth.
Not much footwork from Garcia, flatfooted even the commentators mentioned it
British fighters always lack something critical. Just never have enough to compete in America.
Garcia takes shots like an irishman in a pub
Ryan is such a fun fighter to watch, he is always super aggressive
The things Ryan lacks are defense & precision. The things he excel are power and explosive energy. He's so young so he can only get better 👏💯
congrats idol ryan garcia
Contra gervonta Davis no tiene posibilidad ryan García,  se vio todo un novato a pesar de haber ganado!!!!!
Hes not even close to santa cruz let alone Davis. Dont do it kid.  NOT EVEN CLOSE... Davis KOs Garcia with a right uppercut. Garcia is nice. but not an A fighter. C level right now
He will not be matched tough after this fight unless they wanna lose their cash cow lol he got heart but man if he get hit by a real puncher with power it's lights out
As i observed ryan garcia Has a lot to go . Pretty much super inexperience
Luke shouldve gone alll out when he knocked him down
Am I the only one that doesn't like Ryan?
Ryan got knocked out but he definitely came back up determined to win, just as the karate kid😁
Very impressive
Tank would clart garcia
This is to show that you can get knocked down, just get back up and never give up!
Way to comeback from a knockdown that was a wake up call to remind him you’re not invincible in there and anything could happen in a dangerous sport like that. Congrats to ryan
That wasn't no flash knockdown. Ryan got dropped flat on his face but he showed a will to win & be great gotta respect that
What if tank lands that?
If it was UFC, Garcia ended at round 2... Easy win for campbell
Id pay an obscene amount of money to turn garcia into a vegetable state  the cocky little mug
If u watched that video when they said the liver hurts the most and can bring anybody doen
Check out my music! Subscribe & Like my page?
Someone needa put ryan in his place
garcia needs to improve his footwork, moves like a heavyweight
The same way people are worried about his defense need to keep that same energy about this kids power. Not sure many champs weighing 135 can take that vicious body shot, but we shall see!!
Luke lost the body shot challenge! 🤣😂😂
Where are the haters?🙄😂
Campbell exposed Garcia on this Fight. 😅👍
Round 5: “Beautiful combination from Ryan Garcia.”  *2 punches land on gloves, 2 miss completely
2:56 why his arm cocked back that hard
ONE BODY SHOT AND THIS GUY GOES AWAY....  NO WONDER WHY HES TRYING TO KEEP HIS DISTANCE
Great fight!
Always a bunch of boxing experts in the comment section
I think if he fights a fighter than is more of a defensive fighter he gone lose cause when he got dropped if that dude would've countered Ryan when he was going crazy than he would've dropped again
CAMBELL NEEDS THE LEARN TO SMOTHER PUNCHES YOU CANT ALWAYS MOVE OUT AND AWAY FROM SHOTS
Luke should have been aggressive after that knockdown. It could turned out differently if he did.
Why are liver shots taking down British fighters, Canelo took two fighters down with liver shots  and now Ryan Garcia...interesting. I guess the Reynoso camp just loves the liver
Golden boy!
Me vs my meat everyday
Ryan made mistake calling out Tank.... easy fight for Tank. Some moves from Ryan reminds me of those AMATEUR.
“Fire melts ice”  -Ryan Garcia
Luke would be world class if he had a killer instinct.  He's a great fighter and very technical, but just doesn't pounce when the time is right
If Tank hits him with that he isn't getting up!! 💤 🛌 and that's fact's!! 😂
Slow feet, backs up straight & repeatedly hit with same combos. Garcia spending too much time in front of heavy bags. Too many flaws to fight those real contenders hes been calling out
2:38 🚀🥊!!!
Everything a young champion needs to do to grow. Run into adversity , clear the Cobb Webbs , find the finish.   That’s a championship performance from Garcia against a very tough , composed , and experienced fighter
Campbell was being too careful, he should have taken more risk after the knockdown
The only fight I wanna see is Ryan vs Devin Haney these two need to fight. Everyone single time someone tells Ryan about it he says yea yea in the future but when they tell it to Devin he’s always ready anytime
That was like a movie
bro i miss crowds
He did that body shot to jake Paul with protection and jake was still hurting I can’t imagine how much damage that did to him
I like Ryan.. but he won't get up from a Tank uppercut like that!
a ryan lo conoci cuando no era nadie, cuando debuto como profesional en el box hoy en dia es el mejor en lo que hace
bruh that celebration is sus
Would have been nice to see Ryan go to sleep after that knockdown
Ryan fell down like one of those characters on Family Guy!
The simp finally got dropped!!
Great work,  but he still got a long way on footwork and head movement.  Im sorry to say but he isnt ready for Tank.  If that was Tank hitting him second round,  he would have been sleeping.
7:34 celebrating like covid19 is gone🙈
Garcia vs. Haney next
And your telling me Ryan wouldn’t knock out Jake Paul
Garcia was never in trouble
Safe to say we need a Tank vs Ryan Garcia fight.. honestly would be the fight of the decade
Luke could've won but he wasn't aggressive  maybe
Yall better stop calling him "the kid"
Very nice shot from Campbell
Luke might win if he throws combination to Ryan Garcia and put pressure in every single round.
ryan going to be 30-0 in his future of boxing
Jake paul Idk
He has no explosive power and no combination of punches to dominate, I'm talking about Luke
Haven’t been keeping up with boxing anymore besides Ryan & tank who is in their class is worth taking a look at ?
Ryan Garcia just showed everyone his weakness by being knock down in the second round.
Ryan’s very flat footed...if he can fix that he’ll be great..if he doesn’t he’ll get stopped soon
2:40 - 5:15 - 7:15 GO!!!
You see Gervonta won’t let him off of respect him at all
You see Gervonta won’t let him off
Campbell is a bottle job. He had this fight in his hands and he gave it away. The same story as the Loma fight. He could of been so much more if only he had a bit more guts about him. A real shame
Great fight
Ryan did a steph curry celebration back there, he already knew it was over after he landed that body shot
Like how theres a lot of boxing experts on this👀
Something about watching Ryan Garcia hit the floor made me sad and feel bad for him
Tank vs Ryan who wins?
Felicidades a los dos la verdad se rifaron
These commentators are fukn sold out
Glass jaw RYAN AT ITS FINEST.... MEDIOCRE FIGHTER ... GARCIA TOO OVER RATED
Lack of head movement for pretty boy i guess?
LETS GO KING RYAN
Everybody is getting excited about the win when in reality he beat an over the hill luke campell who is had a few loses recently and hes only british level now hes not world class if he was garcia would have been knocked out the round he was dropped. Garcia will get ko'd by geo davis 100% hes not ready yet if he rushes he will come up short for me. Great talent but hes still just a prospect
Ryan you got our attention... Now let’s make that Tank Davis fight happen
Garcia won, but I was so glad to see him knocked down in the 2nd round. He's cocky because he knows Canelo, so he thinks he's unbeatable. Garcia is highly hyped-up by the media, but he's not that great.
Luckily I got to watch for free
Luke Campbell плохо двигается на ногах и плохо защищается а так ударка не плохой, были шансы выиграть если бы не дырявая защита, У Гарсия конечно другой уровень бокса
This is one of those fights that puts that tingle in your spine when you watch it. Great fight
Spread your cheeks wide open Campbell because garcia is coming to claim
The serious problem I see with Garcia is defense  and stiff stance which Campbell exploited,Garcia’s only defense seems to be backing up and creating distance no side movements no ducking and these are basic training skills
Ganó Miss universo
boring fight
молодая легенда
What a boring fight.
Miss match
5 million in 2 days that's incredible
Garcia walang depensa,,,,,,
Ryan Garcia need to fight with boxers someone from Uzbekistan🇺🇿 after then he will knew that his level is not so higher!
Garcia gustong labanan si paquiao ,,,,,,,,marami ka pang kakainin bigas boy,,,,,,,,dadaan kpa sa butas ng karayom,,,,,,,mahihirapan kpa ni tank dave's,,,,,,,,,,
I Didn't Even Know Ryan Was Fighting?
Im just curious if he can recover from a Tank Davis punch?!. 🙄🙄🙄
Bodys shots r underrated
He have the offense of Canelo.. he better train slick defense like Hopkins
the adrenaline during that fight was insane my heart was beating 800 miles per hour 😂
just imagining how that must’ve hurt has me on the floor too
Like for Jake Paul Vs Ryan Garcia
They forgot about covid
Thank you :)
Campbell could of ended his night early but didn't follow through.
This kid wants to challenge Loma soon, but if he thinks he can face a monster like Loma with that low guard and with no foot work, he will be not even able to see Loma coming from every angle of his guard.
That Garcia kid needed that little taste of humbleness to keep his feet on the ground.
Bruh them chicken legs of campbell
if broner was still in this weightclass he would have beat ryan garcia and gervonta davis in the same night
I feel like he got the win but there’s a lot he can learn from this fight also. He needs to work on defense and he’s lucky to have canelo as a mentor so he should really take advantage of that
Como lo levantaron para celebrar... parecía que los 2 tipos estaban abusando de el.
He takes to many hits to be calling out Tank Davis like that.
FIGHT WAS LAME AF.....GERVONTA WILL TAKE HIS HEAD.....!!!!!!
A test by fire and he past the test.. He was being tested and he passed the test.. I like thank. But the only thing he needs to work on its on the canelo type of head movement and hips movement and he can be not just tank and teofimo but anybody.
Is that ryan García who wants to beat the legendary?
This young man is going to be something to deal with in the next couple of years.
Everyone has turned into a Boxing Expert 😂😂
I would rather go down in the ring with a liver shot then get dropped hard. I never thot ryan would go down ever.
Teofimo obliterates Ryan Diva Garcia.
The body shot was predicted since from Round  5 Garcia has been using his left hook to the head to get Campbell always ready for a left to the head. Campbell kept scrunching and ducking to avoid the left to the head. That leaves his body exposed at that moment. Then at 6:40 you see Garcia go for a trial and saw he was able to get a left to the body easily. After that Garcia took the chance and went for the hard body shot which took the win. It’s a simple but effective strategy of getting your opponent used to a certain attack then switch it up on them. Great fight!
Now go fight Lopez or Loma
Don’t read my name
Тот самый русский комментарий )))
Ryan may be a great fighter but he’s proving that he’s just another cocky wannabe that gonna meet the wrong person one day and he’s gonna let a bad loss go to his head and that’ll be the end of his career
11 years old vs 1 year old
Isipin mo nalng kung kay paquiao or donaire na left hook ang tumama kay garcia.sapalagay ko buong gabi sya matutulog
Tank would destroy this kiddo
This kid needs to hit the drawing board. Hes in big trouble with most of the fighters in his division. Hes had handpicked easy fights.
RIP Gervonta Davis
He's body must still be buzzing, the volts in that shot were over a 1000⚡🔌
😂😂😂😂🍼🍼le falta mucho
Im not boxer but my idol is ryan garcia
Ngl kinda glad Ryan got knockdown. Hopefully he realizes that fast hands is not everything and he works on his defense more
No comenta el error que hicieron con Fernando Vargas teniendo 22 se lo Pusieron en bandeja a Un Feliz Trinidad con más de 15 peleas de título Mundial. G.Davis no es Trinidad pero Lomachenko que es rapidisimo y con más experiencia que nadie no lucio  Davis es otra Cosa.
Idc id a got up, Thats embarrassing.
He learn body shot a lot from Canelo's bootcamp. That's great !
Weak
Que decepción así es cómo crecen los boxeadores abase de dinero rayan García no sirve el réferi para la pelea el chavo no estaba noqueado basura
Me parece muy rara esta pelea...
Definitely an entertaining fight!
yeah Ryan needs to use his speed more bc he doesn't move as much and needs to block stick and weave more to not get hit with lucky headshots
He failed the body shot Challenge
Well done Mexican champ the English too weak
Young Amir Khan would've beaten Ryan Garcia
If Ryan got dropped that hard by Luke Campbell There is no way he survives Tank Davis or Lopez😂
All I see is the Carona virus spreading in Dallas
The kid got the heart and fast hand for sure. But he lacks footwork and head movement.
This kid is FEARLESS and its his best trait!!!
DAZN commentary is awful🤮
Nausty!!
and he's calling manny pacquiao? haha if manny hit him that clean. he's gonna be like hatton.
Everybody sack riding Garcia but tank will knock him out and Haney will definitely out box him it’s a reason Haney called him the easiest in the weight class
MP laughs lol 😂
Boy chin weak af...
What a great fight! WOW
Casi pierde el bocon ese
The new king... Amazing!!!
I can see another Amir Khan in Ryan Garcia. Just less fragile.
With Canelo supporting you👍🏻
Garcia is a great fighter!!
Garcia is weak footwork is Shakey tank will destroy him
Он родился Чемпионом 🔥👊
Wow
Ryan will never last longtime being a champ,, he's jaw is weak..
These type of upcoming stars are the best. Once they get like Canelo it gets boring af lol. Hope this kid does great in his career and becomes the new face of boxing for us Mexican people
Am I the only one that want to see ryan G vs AB
Garcia has defensive issues. He will get put to sleep by Tank and Lopez. Loma and Haney will outbox him.
7:26 the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak
Garcia is not a best boxer...he retired early i think...this is my opinion..
manny can make this cry
Respect to our Brit you done yourself proud brother
Luke Campbell ignored so many flurries and |uppercut opportunities here, Davis or Haney wont miss such opportunity. Not sure Garcia wuld be able to manage the ferocity of Davis with wicked intention in every  punch
3:29 thank me later hahaha
LUKE campbell didn't want to win that bad Ryan Was On skates after that knock down
Luke was way to caution with him!
Marquez
Garcia is not ready for tank
that was 100% a liver shot
Garcia is a year away from being able to truly challenge Davis, Haney, or Lopez. Golden Boy should be patient and build him up even more, which will generate more interest and sell more. Let the Reynosos and Canelo clear up some of his flaws before going up a level. He's a year, year and a half away in my opinion.
standing flat footed
Garcia gets dropped by campbell,  He's not ready for davis, Davis is heavy handed and literally breaks you down once he hurts you  Davis is just too strong for garcia
Wow great technique!!!!
mcgregor said it nicely once: timing beats speed , Garcia has to watch out for the counter punchers , and also learn from canelo the beauty of feign the punches. he showed some guts this fight though
Gervanto Devis🔥👍
brutal
Best of the best. What a great fight. Both winners I say
Him and Canelo have something in common whenever it comes to body shots or left hooks to the face same movement same technique  Madness
Todo arreglado
you're still young to call the pacman pacquiao. what if that left hook that dropped you  is pacman's arm? you'll end up like hatton!!!
Wow that was one of carnelo deadly body punch!!! Can’t tell if it’s land in the face or body
Livershot
Kaya wag muna pangarapin na makalaban si manny ryan, talagang alam muna mangyayari😁😁🤣🤣✌✌
Ryan is the real deal
It's that Mexican blood!
Campbell fought nervous... Had he let his hands go, he would have got him out the way easily.
Pelea calza contratan a sparring clara mente se noto lo mal que se sintió el de azul porque se le fue ese izquierdazo
Blueprint from Gervante's fight, Ryan needs to keep his jaw guarded
that liver shot is a killer
Down goes Garcia 😧
A left handed could beat ryan hé got 0 head movement
"Luke's staying cool"... Cool Hand Luke 😎
As a boxer myself, you wouldn't believe me on how much a liver shot can hurt
Far beyond the caliber of Manny Pacquiao these fighters... 😆😆
He got nicked down
Noooo ryan
Garcia got exposed
Someone who capitalizes on counter punching will be his biggest challenge. He also was bound to get a hook to the face, he's always exposed. Surprising first knockdown of his career but surprising comeback as well.
on social media ryan has defense and moves his head but in real life he doesnt move his head or have defense. i think u could fight haney but stay away from tank, loma, teo, shakur
All Ryan fights is bums
Nk
Campbell could put more pressure after knockdown
@
Get ready Mr TANK, GARCYA is coming.
English boxing analysts are body punching the air rn
Ryan , work on defense ! You have plenty of offense .  You can be the champ .
What is he talking about "left hook is the best punch against southpaws..."? Nope. Straight right down the pipe. Conventional knowledge passed down for years and years. A counter left would only land against a guy who drops his hand after he throws the jab or the hook himself. The same is true of a southpaw fighting orthodox. That is why you are constantly battling for the outside lead foot position. Commentary like this really makes me miss Lampley, Kellerman, and Jones
Hahah they all booed cambell when he was walking out would of loved to see there faces when he folded Ryan
Ryan vs Tim Tszyu would be awesome. Shame they’re in different weight classes.
Dear Human,  Jesus loves you so much. He died on the cross for our sins! Me and you are 2 very sinful people, whether we killed someone, or told a little lie. Even though we  don't deserve grace, " For by grace, we have been saved through faith" Ephesians 2:8. Because of Jesus dying on the cross, we can now recieve eternal life with him by repenting and turning to him. Read your bible and pray to him! Jesus loves you :)
Hes not ready for the tank
They are both lack head movement and footwork. Garcia's chin is always wide open. If he doesn't work on it he is going to pay dearly in the near future.
If Ryan Garcia face Davis maybe he will be in trouble... just my opinion
That ref counted to quick fk that ref
Wow what a fight!!! Garcia took that knock down like a G!!! Got up and got on business!!! I feel he just earned some stripes for this one.
when ryan finally beats the whole division haters will 135 only had suckers anyway. Box fanbase has a 2 digit avarage IQ.
That was quite embarrassing
Canelo really taught him that deceptive body shot.. he's the master of that technique
Best ever👑
Sorry ryan time to rest
liver shot
You literally box the most shittest people going
I’m gonna make 100,000 dollars from trading options on Robinhood
The fight was great but the commentary was a little biased
Davis is to much for this kid
Garcia needs to be humble
Ad *I am Canelo and I approves of that body shot
Congratulations King Ryan!!!!
Holy, that punch was insane
Should of pressed him in the 2nd hype train Garcia
everyone knows what Rg weakness, his face.haha
That Garcia is a beast
Ashita no Joe
VIVA MEXICO A LA VERGA LOS WEROOOS
Now this is boxing at its finest!!
7:13 campbell got no stamina to fight, he legit almost collapsed
Clarted
Garcia got a weak chin!
I know where he learned that left hook body shot from Canelo 😈❤️
it was the Mexican blood in him that made him get back up like it was nothing
🤭🤭🤭everyone is so use to Ryan punching the face to get a knock out but forgot he has body punches that will take your breath away😂😂
anyone else noticed when ryan got knocked down the ref was counting hella fast but in Campbell's knockdown the ref counted normally?
Garcia fans had a heart attack when he went down
crazy how there is an 11 year difference between ryan and campbell
He's about... another 40 different lifetimes worth of boxing behind vasily.wouldnt last more than 3 round d with no mass
Now I really want to see Inoue v Garcia....
Knockdown best moment, teo lopez brutal ko to garcia
im happy because garcia taste the knock down!
right on the liver, that's everyone's weakness
he got fast power punch but he needs to improve his chin or else tank will demolish him.
FINISH OF CARRIER !
Campbell used that Manny Pacquio move right there,  that's why Garcia dropped.
Se dejó ganar ryan estaba bien pero su rival se dejo ganar esa es mi opinión
Ryan HYPE Garcia got EXPOSED!
The thing that luke was missing was a stiff jab. Ryan was coming at him constantly....
ryan learned his lesson in r2. he is gonna be more wise and dangerous
Ryan still need one more big fight before he fights tank he can’t go rushing in because he’s still only 22 years old
Gervonta left hand will really hurt him
8:05 look how fast that liver punch was...
Tank Davis and Teofimo Lopez can beat Ryan Garcia
The next amir khan in the making.
If Ryan Garcia works with Jake Paul he may learn some new defense techniques.
Luke looks so young to be 33
I love this man Anthony Joshua fihgt
All that is left for Ryan is to know that he has a bigger heart than Davis  and get over him Davis is not go answer anyways
Wow, talk about an open invitation for a KO with that guard sooooo open
Man, I am SHOCKED. Never lose hope during the fight. Now I see that you can handle the stress pretty well. All the best for you
Ryan need to improve a lot if he wants to beat Davis.
This was such a great fight, great start to the year of boxing 🔥🔥
Feel like Campbell didnt take advantage of that knockdown enough. If he would've dogged him and maybe got the 2nd knockdown, then another. But hey....thats how it goes!
That Body Punch was like hitting a Sand Bag...
Jit fought a well experienced fighter I wonder wat conversation the media gon use now
Luke got that chance in round2 but didnt grab it..lol
🥶
When you hurt a young fighter or any fighter in a professional fight. you go after & attack. not just stand there & pose infront of your opponent this is why when you eyes  R open to the fix
He better not fight the tank he will ko garcia to much power for garcia
Subscribed to dazn for this❤️❤️
That body shot is disadvantage of a southpaw fighter.  We’re literally exposing our liver to you
la garra del leon
i hope he doesnt end up like Amir Khan. Insane speed but glass jaw.
Still waiting for Garcia to fight a top fighter. Boring.
Campbell should knock him down immeditely after that first ko punch. Unfortunately for him, garcia gor recovered. Indeed, Opportunity knocks only once.
บีบให้เธอไม่ฝฝใม.
Gazelle punch!!!!
Man, i read some article that this Garcia wish to fight Pacquiao in 140 or 147. With just this skills? I doubt! He may never reach round 5 when pacquiao gets serious.
Based on Garcia's performance here, calling out for Pacquiao is a suicidal thought🤣
all the body shot challenges finally paid off

3:27 i know he won but this is so satisfying
King took that punch like nothing wow🔥
He has no chance against tank Davis
Definitely not ready for TANK
R6an garcia Lucky boy
And gareth davies somehow thought the rounds were close...how sad that is.
Garcia's footwork needs to improve.
Ryans right foot always leaves the floor after he is throwing a right hand and he keeps his chin up all the time, backwards and going forward. Teofimo, Tank and Haney will knock him out
👎🏼
Few moments where talent beats experience
Defense looks stiff as a board, and what a luuucky body shot from R.Garcia, congrats on winning tho
Make sure to watch my latest video of Ryan garcia and luke Campbell. Suscribe for more.
7:56 oooohuuu jajajaja
Garcia is white remember not black and he's different against canelo I think gervonta davis will knock him out black people face dont bleed fast and can take more punch
Las nuevas generaciones, buen rendimiento y energía pero poca técnica y golpeo como sobrellevar una pelea, se van a la cabeza y noquear, no existe un planteamiento.
Haha😆  Ryan is arrogant
Garcias footwork when attacking looks off, seems off balance a lot. Not sure how he would fare against a powerful counter puncher. Still young and plenty to learn but not sure how he would fare against teofimo or tank
Go Dallas
If campbell has the power like tank, ryan will sleep all night .
is that Ryan McGee from supermega?
👏👏👏😰💥
aww thats close ryan almost sleeps in the canvas
Nit real
Full fight plsssssss
this kid wont last  6 round  with the oldpacman
Lucky shot
he isnt ready yet for tank i think,but the kid is dynamite
4.5 mil views in one day.....WOW
Unlucky Campbell u done us proud don’t worry 🇬🇧
Join fat man stan media group on Facebook for all boxing fights
3:46 that boy saw his life flash before his eyes
So embarasing garcia k.out..
Danggg tht body shot was fire🔥🔥🔥💯 but congrats to campbell for tht drop, it was a nice drop
so nice to see an actual crowd
Luke too passive but did seem like got that one lucky punch n thats it
Campbell made a mistake by not pressuring him after that knockdown, could’ve played out completely different
Little men 135
Ryan garcia is from mexico
You must fight manny to prove your worth...
pov u came here for the knock out
Lukes nothing short of an embarrassment after that second round. Wheres the ruthlessness to go and finish someone when they're in serious trouble? Anyone with some spite about them has garcia out of that second Rd. Tank/haney/Lopez all finish him there
Campbell should been finish earlier .that bell safe him .
How is this #1 on trending?
Not rdy for tank. honestly, delahoya has been losin to mayweather's game for over a decade. Just forshadowing the future for yall.
Campbell doesn't want to win,  he doesn't throw a bomb on that knock down
Haney will crush em
This match was dope af, expected Ryan to get the W 🔥🙏🏻
Gotta respect it bro 🤷🏽‍♂️
Garcia is the real deal
Tank is knocking Ryan out in 3 rounds if that fight ever happens
Triple C will destroy ryan
Loser
This  fight shows everyone  what kind of opposition  garcia has been up against as if we diddnt know  we do now...   still it shows us he has heart aswell  garcia is in top 4  I'm not sure if he beats  tank  or lopez  I think he beats  haney  we mustn't forget lomachenko  I still think he can come back and beat  lopez or anyone else  in the devision
Loser
When are we getting Garcia vs Haney????
Here is full of boxing experts ahahah. I just have questions, why Garcia is done and overrated after just one knockdown that he reversed with a finish few rounds later, while Tyson fury has been dropped many times (at least 3) and just scored a draw (vs wilder) and is called GOAT.
Soy mexicano y mis respetos para el inglates
Ryan garcia needs a little bounce...
Now every body👏Gracia, now its time for him to take on Tank.
Ryan garcia need a little bounce...
Great fight we need more training defence
Luke doesnt Look 33.
Pizza or salad
essential workers huh
Gotta keep the face covered don’t want someone like Gervonta catching you with a punch like that
Ryan is only 22 and has all the time in the world to improve. This is not the best ryan garcia and I'm sure he know's that as well
Who wants a rematch
2:37 never seen Ryan get dropped like that.
Bro I saw this live, and this fight gave me goosebumps.. LOVED it🔥🔥🔥
Is that his performance for tank davis? Hawshaw...
Please prescribe to my channel.  Thanks.
His poor footwork will be the death of him.
Emanuel Navarrete versus Ryan yabang Garcia
Ryan Garcia is KO but he is still undefeated after the fight..hahaha..can Ryan Garcia defeat navarrete..Garcia Vs Navarrete
What a fight
I think Garcia broke his rib look at the way Campbell’s side is almost caved in when he’s on his knees
Liver shots ain’t no joke.
Would’ve been over at the end of round 5 when Campbell was running like a lost kindergartner on his first day of school😂
Dazn commentary is trash
3:27 heres how to hit garcia,now time for somebody to punch harder,quicker and with bad intentions🤣🤣🤣 free tip😂😂😂
Make the Tank fight happen. Another Tmt  Golden boy mega fight
Campbell still the first one who knockdown Garcia. Respect for Campbell
Dallas Stadium Arena would Literally Explode  if "The Truth" and "Flash" Ever fought there! That YoungN got Hella Fans!
Watch the foot RG stepping on. Reminds me of marquez stepping on pac
Junior doin macarena and got ktfd and thinks hes ready for Pacquiao? You barely just stopped wearin diapers. Grow up and earn your stripes BOY!!!!
Garcia needed this experience.  It will make him better.
Garcia the new golden boy  his opponents always been a joke u get an half a decent fighter in there with him and he kos his open face everytime he wants
Is one of the commentators: Joe Rogan?
7:10  Campbell: gets a liver hit Garcia: isn't phased at all Garcia: Proceeds to counter with a liver hit Campbell: Ight imma head out
If Davis landed the left Campbell landed, Ryan isn't beating the 10 count
Campbell looks younger than Ryan
Then you wish to fight pacquiao well
It's was tough.
Is that a liver shot? I know that illegal but it looks like it was. I only ask before getting hit in the liver is extremely painful and many people start to hyperventilate naturally when getting hit hard in the liver. Looks like he couldn’t catch his breath after getting hit on his right side
Campbells leg doe
This video is number one on trending now. That means people like watching Garcia. The influencers are bringing more fans in.
DAZN would be great if they had an option where we just hear the fight and arena. Mute These commentators they are always one sided, and cater to one fighter. Sergio needs to go he wasn’t a great fighter and acts like it, he’s more of a ESPN fighter geez. Another thing!! Stop with the ads within the fights ! What happen to hearing what the corner is saying! I thought this was pay per view ! I’m paying so I don’t see any ads!!
Though he got knocked down, he’s literally only laying for about 2 seconds
Nice fight. Campbell should've been more aggressive.
Classic liver shot
Ryan’s comeback my goodness!!!!!
poor Campbell he fought bravely
The views on this tho
I met Ryan at the grove and told him he was my favorite upcoming boxer I stand behind that guy great body blow to finish a great competitor
Imagine if that left hook was delivered by Tank Davis
How a straight outta high school boy defeat that 33 year old man who’s been in this for a while 😆 💯 Ryan Garcia!!!!
weird celebrations, looked like happy gilmore with his skinny caddy hahahahahaha
Bought
Another glass chin
That’s a Pacquiao’s Left Hook right at the button...😂😂😂
Gervonta nomber 1 lightweight
I read that Ryan was mostly self trained and only recently started training under a serious trainer(Reynoso). Is that true? If so, dude has insane talent. Most people can't even shadowbox properly after self training, this guy is KOing pros.
Can I get some likes
Ryan looks scared
A knockdown, serious technical flaws, crying and a barbie doll crown on his head after the fight?  I see Broner 2.0 here, coming soon.
Le falto mucha más agresividad a luke despues de tumbarlo.. Y Ryan tiene pegada sólida, pero aun tiene mandíbula de princesa
That hit was like watching a head on car crash ad in slow motion. Deadly 🥊
My man Ryan got knocked out, but got up and became a beast.😈😈😈😈😈
That liver shot, made famous by the best in history, Julio César Chávez sr; at one point : 89 wins 0 losses 75 KO Never been knocked down, nor hurt, undefeated for close to 15 years... The only man to ever do that.  Be blessed
7:39 - Imagine an average guy being hit by that tremendous body shot
Really didnt like the biased commentary for this fight. Disappointing.
Great fight, would love to see a rematch. If you look at the 2nd rd replay Ryan was out cold when he got hit and awake when he hit the canvas, reminded me of Ali-Frazier 1 when Ali got hit with Frazier's Frazier's left hook that dropped Ali.
If Luke could have turned it up after the knockdown. He probably could have done more.
Stay in the Olympic games luke
this match remind me about Yu and Dakeda fight
I hope Ryan face Gervonta Davis when his more mature! Learn from Canelo mistakes when fought against Floyd.
People who watch Ryan Garcia fights are casual boxing fans... “the casuals”
Ryan just getting started let him learn
there needs to be a rematch
Can’t wait for Devin Haney v Ryan Garcia
Everybody fails to understand that every boxer is different, Garcia is 21 and is doing great for his age. Every fighter has a weakness but u have to use your strengths to your advantage. E.g wilder can't box to save his life but when that right hand baptizes you, you'll leave to tell the tale of the Bronze Bomber !
Jajajjaa them legs. 1 Kick I land in that little legs and it’s game over. I am from Mexico and I am waiting for that wannabe Mexican to fall.
And he wanna fight tank, he ain’t gettin up when tank hit him like that
Next should be linares for Ryan!  Ryan is still green for Davis.
thats canelo level , liver punch right there
Love Ryan so happy he won I was rooting for him but he’s definitely not Ready for Tank.  His defense needs to get a little more stronger he need a couple more fights then he go after the top tier fights.
Lol take it baby that's what happen if you're not paying attention.
When Garcia went down in the second I was like 'uh oh'..what a recovery. Also, now I know why Campbell is two-time Championship contender...great fight
First time seeing garcia fight not impressed he fight like a high schooler gets to hype
JAJAJAAJAJA DISCULPAME AUNQUE  NO FUE MI INTENCION Y AL NO SABER BOXEAR  LLA MIRARON TODOS QUE NO VALES MADRE PERO  HAORA COMO QUE  ME PEGAS Y  LLA NO ME PARARE  JAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJA
DAZN need to ditch the commentators never heard so much cringe for one guy... fair play campbell you showed that garcia has only fought Uber drivers and got knocked down by a proper fighter 🇬🇧 🇬🇧
I almost saw my bet go down the drain when ryan got knocked down. My heart sank..
Nice video
Sheesh they was throwing bombs all fight
Maybe he ll stop running his mouth and start drilling frl I dnt see him any where near tank
2:40 and 7:16
To flat footed needs footwork
Garcia a bit to stiff
You can already hear Jake Paul calling him out now he got knocked down 😂
Campbell have no footwork he is just standing there with Garcia no head movements
Ryan need to stop putting both his hands out when try to get out of pressure situations. He could have protected himself from that shot easily.
My liver started hurting just watching that ko
He likes the bodyshot challenge
That body shot was just shade of canelo
He needs to improve his footwork especially the lateral movement, if he wants to take the inside angle often then like Pacman he should be moving laterally and be more active
This man Ryan is 22, this man Luke got 11 years of more experience than him. Ryan’s work ethic is astonishing.
This guy dear to challenge PACMAN, goodluck to you brother. This guy is lucky enough that he fight a fighter who is not a counter puncher.
Luke let him off the hook after the knockdown!
Glass chain
body shots are so deadly
That's what mexicans is known for. The more hurt they got, the more fiercer they become. But I still think Loma will school Ryan because of Ryan's footwork, he is so stationery and flat footed. So I think Loma will beat him in decision but KO is impossible so yeah. IMO
Not gonna lie the knock by Campbell at 2:38 was clean.
Wait wat he gave up over that dude got dropped and still fought on smh y garcia is the best
After watching this fight Ryan ain’t nowhere near ready for Tank. Tank is a lot more clean both offense and defense and way better of a finishers after knocking someone down.
Tank can blow it😂😂😂
Ryan has got a lot of work to do on his defense. Campbell exposed that.
thats a similar punch of marquez to pacquiao in their 4th fight. (punched by campell)
Ryan Garcia toughest opponent so far
He hit his liver
4:02 dat speed...
And he say he can beat gervonta 💀
Direct power punch to the liver. RIP
Who's here for the body shot?
He's not ready for tank davis even lopez he needs more training and preparation
Wow ryan Garcia is real deal.. he should fight mayweather not Logan paul
Insane match up !  Both nearly k.o , waow next generation of fighters looks really fast and strong !
Canelo looking like a sensei
So it's likely that Tank Davis and Garcia will fight around 2027 because right now for sure Oscar won't want that fight and Garcia being just 22. It's gonna be Floyd vs Oscar all over again
If Ryan Garcia and Tank Davis fight will happen, I'll route to Ryan Garcia. That's the hardest part because I believe Ryan Garcia doesn't have a chance to defeat tank davis. May 2 or 3 more figths with top contenders that's the time ryan will have a chance.
The flaw on Garcia was that he stretched his arma way too often to avoid getting hit. That left some serious openings. He needs to work on that.
Tank is going to put him to sleep the same way but he’s not getting up after
3:23 You can see canelo saying “calm down”
As soon as Ryan got that body shot I knew it was game over, that body shot hurt and i felt it lol
Great fighter. Might want to hire a public relations representative. His public image could be better.
This fight better than Loma vs Lopez
7:38 O_O that slowmo insane
0:47 that actually happened soo fast that i do not know what happened
Garcia shows his weakness
Campbell, though got lost, keep showing that these champions always got loop holes.
He needs to fight tank. I think tank will knock him out but if Garcia can go the distance he can win by decision.
Ahora es cuando soy fanático real del joven García. Por ello, les recomiendo a canelo y a reynoso que lo superen sólo en la defenza.  Pues, coraje ya demostró que le sobra.
Campbell still fights like an amateur throwing 2 punch Combos looking for points
I bet 3.0M people out of the 4.2M that watched this video, don’t even watch boxing.
Ryan garcia is not Ready for Tanks power idk man I just don't see Garcia take that power. He will lose everything. None of Garcias fights were as exciting as Gervanta Davis vs Leo Santa Cruz IMO
Respect For Garcia
Looks like a clone of young Oscar de la Hoya
Hey garcia fight gervonta...you are dead hahaaha
Tank is too strong for him lol
Oh yea ryan givin DAZN real numbers 👏
Can we get Garcia vs Mayweather?
3:30 why does Luke Campbell look so concerned for Ryan??? Looks like he was paid to lose and slipped up by catching him with the left hook lol
Dont talk about tank sir. You not ready ryan!!!!
Now where are you haters????😂 Still not gonna give our boy Ryan his credit???
The Bell Rang before he Turned.
Gervonta will eat garcia alive.
Everybody talking about Ryan's knockdown, but no one talking about that viscous bodyshot.
If he knocked him down he not ready for tank and that other guy he keep calling out
Excellent fight. Ryan got hit by a punch that would have KOd most men and he got up and composed himself. That finishing body shot was wicked.
Garcia showed great heart after a powerful left, the kid is so fast but wasn’t fast enough to dodge that, great body shot to finish the contest 💯 in my opinion I think Garcia can be caught against a more skilled fighter I’m not a hater I’m just giving my opinion. Only time will tell!!
I hated the commentary
✝️Listen to my music ! Find "Rvckk" Anywhere !✝️
ryan garcia vs loma pls
Yes let’s go RYAN!!!!!
Next NAOYA INOUE VS GARCIA. OR DAVIS VS GARCIA..what do you think?
Guys please subscribe me for Martial Arts, basic Gymnastics, Self-Defense Techniques and Fitness.
LESS GOOOOOOOO RYAN GARCIA KING RYAN WINS!
Did he break any ribs?
only if would shortin his shot and see he had him
If Luke would've put a right hand behind the hook the fight might've been over
Is this his first knock down ?
That’s Garcia shows his left hand on Instagram even hurting the Francis Ngonnou with gym shark
smart move by Ryan, he was never knocking Campbell out with a hook.
Tank hit him with that shot he ain't getting up
Zz
King Ryan!!! California Native Represent!!!!
What a beautiful fight.
I know he made it, but this was Luke campbell. Before this he was asking for tank. He needs to improve more before asking for his career to end in humiliation .
vtuber 423
Jake Paul puts Ryan Garcia to sleep. Paul vs Garcia. Make it happen.
He ain't ready for Davis
Ryan was down just like Mosley's (pac fight)
Was a great fight..I just don't understand how he can't keep his lead foot outside? Would be a little easier to control the distance and throw shots
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏✌️
Sayang campbell talo tuloy ako
respect to Campbell, mad love to Garcia, and the commentator that said "HE"s ASKING QUESTIONS" Can I get up? Do I want to get up? Comment of the year! very fly my man!
Campbell’s mistake is he didn’t go ham after Ryan got ko’d
King Ryan Garcia, a King Amir Khan in the making...glass jaw
Tank Davis within 3 rounds
Man he got up quick from being knocked down..respect 💪
I want Garcia vs Floyd
Luke’s socks and shoes look like something an 11 year old kid would wear in 2016
2:42 aquí se nota la grandeza de un tipo que no durará mucho como campeón..
From round 2 onward i swear Campbells face was literally blue
Nice comeback...he’d better hold off on Gervonta though.
I think Luke hit ryan as hard or as clean as he could, because at 2:51, thats the same face canelo had when ggg ate his best shot.
Now Ryan knows what getting ko’d is like
Body shot challenge
Lopez vs Garcia.    Make it happen!!
7:11
He's only 21 and is only getting better. Boxing is going to be lit at these lower weight classes with these younger guy's who can KO foos
Faze Sensei: LEFT HOOK LIVER SHOT
check the footwork, Campbell had nice footwork but his hands didn't move well. Of course, a few times both of them stepped on each other foot(bound to happen).
He learn that from Canelo no cap
Garcia: “ Stay down.” Campbell: “ Okay” @7:30   Watch the slow motion
Well Garcia does always do the body shot challenges, goes to show the videos ain't a joke when they get popped in the guts even while wearing safety gear
Luke didn't get in the zone     Auto zone
Sportsmanship is everything specially in professional sports..
Stop running away  Cheeseburger Tank
Wow
He got knocked down by a has been.   I would stay away from Tank or Devon, actually anyone in the top 10.
Why this amateur boxer looks like doesn't have a basic move...some boxer just like hit run hit run hit run and bell goes,next round hit run hit run..bell goes..
Now match him up for a tougher opponent
"everyone has a plan until they got hit in the face" . Ryan got hit. So he went to plan B. He hit back. And boy did he hit back hard! Easiest money of mah life!
sayang nman si campbell kla ko sya na magpapatahimik dyan hehe!
This kid has got so much potential it's insane. Getting knocked down for the first time and getting back up to take this match back is an incredible feat.
Lamentablemente  canbel no lo remato como debe ser muy extraña esa actitud  no esta a la medida de ninguno de los campeones ni de lopez ni de gervonta ni de linares menos de lomachenko
Le ofrezco 30 centavos x ese peleador Ryan  Garcia y me estoy arriesgando
not mma but it works
No lo sé RICK ME PARECE FALSO
Seeing all those mugs in the crowd with masks on is embarrassing.
I laugh at the celebration ,ryan look he have some seizure ahhahahahahah
That liver KO is straight out of Canelos textbook. He taking notes!
Tank hasnt fought anyone on Luke Cambells level
Looks like Garcia learned alot from Canelo,even copying the liver shot😀
Ryan Garcia is not ready for Dave pure facts!
I think a fight should be different...a ko means u won....first drop wins
Its guaranteed that Garcia is gonna get knocked the f out by Gervonta Davis
The befitting coin coherently flash because pizza enthrallingly long next a diligent octopus. reflective, lovely croissant
ryan 1st ever real challenge , tank vs garcia asap
Tank will beat García after seeing this
Real entertaining fight but garcia should avoid tank at all costs
Goku le gana
His defense has lot of flaws boxers like georvante and devin are going to exploit that
What’s the point of wearing masks when people are touching each other?
2:38 y 7:12...muy buenos golpes...💪
the liver punch looked like you get stabbed in jail
Крч красава ✊
Someone saw...How many times did they step their foot each other???
Knockout looks 🤥
I see many weaknesses in Garcia. He must have been coddled to his record. - WW
Here's to cool hand Luke for making it all possible...
7:31 Canelo looked so proud very nice liver shot
Luke Campbell is a great actor like Romero Duno 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Your 2021 with one of my melody
Your 2021 with one of my melody
Your 2021 with one of my melody
Absolutely outstanding fight I think everyone will agree.
Garcia fights with such ferocity.He throws with bad intentions and showed he has great heart getting up from that knockdown.Whats not to like.
That looked suspicious how he just gave up
7:24 I need the @ of the girls on the back :D for research purposes
Bruh that was a Canelo style livershot..
Let’s be honest, gervonta davis puts this kid in a coma when they meet in the ring I’m sorry but if u get dropped by Luke’s left hand then u are most certainly going to sleep when gervontas left hand gets in and I’m a big Campbell fan he’s a great boxer but he’s not a banger
Hay weeee
People always said Garcia's weakness was his vulnerable defense and that once he gets knocked down, he will have trouble fighting back... now what?
Garcia needs to hire Canelo's "conditioning coach" asap.
7:56 that look in Campbell’s face says it hurts plenty!
Fighters ‘never’ recover from body shots
Ryan should please avoid tank and Lopez for now.
He did get the boy Oscar sweatin
Es una pelea tan arreglada que el que nokeo se espantó..
Ryan a C class fighter dont bicker if u a casual
Now its time for the haney fight, the lopez fight, lets see if he can take those fighters, real ones not these one, coz d davis fight seems imposible right now
Wow just like delahoya
Check out my YouTube channel
World star fights are better
👑
A garcia le urge empezar a mover la cintura y la defensa al intercambiar golpes ,qyeda muy desprotegido
If Luke can put Ryan down tanks gonna put him in sleep I think.
Wow what a beautiful hook to the liver. Ryan has anti tank rockets, nearly put Luke out at the end of 5. Tank is next!
Se vendío
This kid is amazing, what a win! Ryan you beast!
O5ogjlq
Que hermoso volado le metieron que bueno para que se eduque pinshi chamaco
Hopefully that knockdown humbles him enough to cover himself up. Pretty careless fighter. Now his future opponents know the chins' the weak spot
Very nice... Now Govanta vs ryan
Boxing is making a comeback!
That is the smoothest body shot it was slick ..😎
García, otro boxeador inflado
Luke should be ashamed
*This was a great fight!* ✊🏾 The fact Garcia got back up and turned the fight around in his favor, says alot. I think he will learn alot from this and come back even stronger and with better defense. *Kid is a star!*
Al menos estuvo entretenida, no como la cartelera anterior
That body shot was bogus it looked fake  seriously
Ryan definitely redeemed himself as a star boxer!!
Hey y’all go pick up some HOLO TOKENS On Bitmart!! Gonna go crazy
Está muy verde y muy pendejo todavía García. He has a lot to improve to become a real fighter not just a limited one shot puncher...
Congrats to both fighters. Both left everything in the ring and fought like gladiators.
#1 trending on YouTube wow🔥🔥🔥
Ridículo García.. Cayó directo al suelo
Still got dropped. you can't change that
I hate Garcia
and there, a legend is born.
Dzan announcers and commentators are completely trash🗑
Ryan is not ready for Tank Davis
is that guy from englind?
Ouch ! My whole stomach dropped when Garcia hit Campbell on the ribs.
Mexicans coming up , we can all grow  nothing is a competition it’s a sport , just enjoy growth
oh so this is where my friend went yesterday I didn't know this would be such a big deal👁👄👁
This kid definitely has great potential!!
Ese garcia le falta mucho boxear
Wowwwww That had me on the edge of my seat. Ryan Garcia just beat a tough boxer. Aint gna lie, that knockdown had me worried.
I've had busted ribs before, that hit is paralysing. You feel your throat sinking into your stomach and it's hard to move afterwards.
Lo peligroso de garcia es que es muy explosivo pero cuando esta frente a alguien medianamente capaz puede llevarse una sorpresa, no se porq este boxeo moderno no procura más técnica y juego de pies
Mans be skipping leg day
Campbell failed the body shot challenge
Y eso que no se le dejo caer completo el izquierdazo, si no no se hubiera levantado
I feel like Ryan Garcia wasn't on his game that night. Something seemed off about him.. he was definitely sloppy. Maybe partying too much?
Amir khan was better than Ryan Garcia, these commentators biased af
And to think Garcia thinks he has a chance with tank 😂😂😂🤔
Garcia has been exposed now. He has a glass chin.
Si le entraron muchos golpes a rayan hay que mejorar su defensa
garcia vs inoue pls
Esta pele fue más hubos que box
Let's give Ryan his Credit. He defeated an Elite athelete in Campbell. But yes, campbell did tested Covid19 Positive 1 month before the fight. In the end it is a respiratory illness which effects your lungs which will compromise ones stamina.
Tank will rock this kid not sure why he wants that fight he needs more time to develop
Creo que todavia le falta para enfrentar a gervota
Ryan using canelo's golden sword
良い試合だな。
2:40 what u came here for
Nice fight
Garcia boxing bots 🤖
Ryan is rising but I feel like he’s gonna have a big fall soon :/
If you can see his defense is always open.  But garcia have a power punch.
pretty face got a wallup, but he did get a great rib shot, all over
RYAN GARCIA ES UN EXTRARRESTRE.
Listen that's against a  fighter that is a nobody yet imagine ryan fighting tank he would been finished right there,   hes being calling him out dude you ain't near ready to fight in that league.     watch what you talk or what you ask for
the kid needed this test , he got it , & passed.    respect !
Que bombazo uffffff lo mato
I said from day one Ryan need to work on his footwork, he stands right in front of his opponent, he doesn’t use angles, he don’t roll with punches, has no defense. He throw wild . Ryan stands no chance vs a top fighter. This was his first fight first real fight and he barely got out of it .
Ugh that gorgeous body shot
Campbell stop his right hand
Ryan gets KO  Everyone in the weight class : "Yup there it is coach"
Garcia has broken into stardom with that hook.
Another “Golden Boy” in the making, a lot of critics have different opinion today.
Mabagal kapa kay Pacquiao
Ryan finally got knocked down
Garcia still needs work
Liver shots are the most lethal no doubt about it 😳⁉️
He's not ready for the power of Tank.
The second I saw Garcia lunge into that body shot, I was thinking, “that’s gonna hurt.” Then I was like, “how is he not falling to his...THERE he goes.”
It’s #1 on tending
Next Ryan garcia vs gervonta davis
#1 on trending
No hate for ryan garcia big respect for this young fighter as much as he respect Manny pacquiao fly high young warrior
Canelo taught him that  body shot. Clearly . Executed beautifully
It looked like his head almost came off lol
Ryan defense is decent but we need to see more
He can’t take on Tank tbh... atleast not yet.
no seriously , ryan should stick to fighting nobodies for like 2 more years . if he wants to stay undefeated
Proof Garcia is overrated
I feel like ryan is not Ryan this match
*Interviewer asks Ryan about the left hook* Ryan Garcia: YES
Everybody think they tough until Ryan comes in with that liver shot  LETS GO KING RYAN
Ryan Garcia has flaws. Humans all have flaws. The thing is how do you react when it gets hot in the kitchen?
different breed .
That body shot was BRUTAL!
اول اختبار حقيقي لجارسيا وكان قد المسؤولية صراحة / انتصار كبير
5:07 Campbell no pacquiao
Поздравляю R.Garcia он интересный боксер . Думаю у него впереди ещё много побед . Но ему надо работать над ногами . Он топчется как медведь по рингу. Всем мир
Boxing isn't over dana,,
you see ryans style , the idea is not to let him grow on you. and specially if you hurt ryan like that
He better not even look in devin haneys direction after that...
This two skipped leg day for the whole 2020
i didnt see the fast hand there, and no headmovement.. if he fights tank, he gonna eat alot of shot.. i think the best move for him is to go down to 130.. he is no business @ 135 .
and cambel was just a lucky punch, davis is more prof he really knows just what to do to set you up.
Tank will eat ryan for breakfast 😋
Fight was fixed at the end Cambell knew he would knock him out no problem he cooled off so they can have a few more fights and make money this is how the money and fame is earned
the England too bad behind people back going to plan herd immunity! letting world all government  behind people back going to plan herd immunity!
Both of them said they were gonna knock the other out, well gg
everyone hating on him because he’s bringing views back to boxing. 😂 but he needs to work on his defense for real.
if loud mouth ryan gets in that situation with davis in the ring, well let me say pobresito lol
Гарсия хорош, но с Ломаченко ему ловить нечего
Check my ringside view videos of this fight
Campbell let off after knockdown could of been different  result if he'd stayed on him... Garica going far 👍
is he copying canelo?  Dont do that man! that the reason you got Koed...
Lol
His similar Sage Northcut in boxing), may be great champion
Tank will destroy this kid. HE'S NOT READY!!!
Lets gooo Ryan!!!!🔥I new it from the start his speed and bounce back is crazy he took that punch like a champ 🤟
liver punch ooooooooo i feel that
Campbell was a great test for Ryan at this moment in his career. You can only get better from here. Got some work to do on that defense and he’s well on his way to true boxing stardom! 👊🏻
Atleast he taste the knockdown!!!/hahahaha
Get the name right he isn’t a “Mini Oscar” he’s the one and only Ryan Garcia 🥊🏆
A ese tal ryan se le nota de lejos que es represumido y sin humildad, al igual que en sus peleas se la da de el mejor, si se dan cuenta después del vergazote que le pego el guero se le bajaron los huevos, que bueno que lo tiro a la lona para que así agarre cuenta que no es el mejor ni llegará a serlo, le falta mucho, solo esta ahí por qué le ponen puros sacos y por qué es mamahuevo del canelo
Golpe  De Suerte 💁🏻‍♂️
whaaaaack
Anyone else noted that pretty poor footwork by Garcia?   He is just another showman that claims to be on the division's top, but with that low guard and that straight-up standing, he wouldn't last more than 5 rounds against Tefimo, Loma, or Gervonta.   He is not what Golden Boy Promotions want us to believe/$ell.
Excellent fight. Thank you very much!
Wait 5 or 7 years later and Ryan would be able to beat anybody
These commentators are trash
That was canelo
Yes!!!!!!!
I think he should fight campbell again
ryan looks a bit clumsy in his defense
After Garcia got up  I could wait for payback .
To all these morons saying Garcia got exposed... This was his step up fight, (only 22)...and he did very well, and u know it,... Stop hating.. he came out of adversity and dominated an Olympic gold medalist, hurt him bad in round 5,..did something both Loma and Linares couldn't and stopped him in the 7th... lots of work to do if he really wants Tank, bt here he passed the test with flying colourz
Ryan garcia vs jake paul
I think Ryan is not ready for Tank or Haney yet. He should fight Linares since he also beat Campbell. This way he can get more experience.
Ryan desperately needs to learn some head movement
Ryan "Glassjaw" Garcia
Cambell was totally out boxing Garcia, Garcia got in a lucky punch. That's the difference between an Olympic gold medalist and a clown that gets carried into the stadium on a throne.
3:24 anyone heard that?
An eye-opener for Garcia... He can be knocked-down suddenly
7:37
And still the champion of the world!
i thought 2021 happy new year will be different!  but today 299029 people infected corona virus!  i don't know what is different! i don't know what happy?
impressive skills of Ryan Garcia will bring him to stardome
Ryan vs jake   Like for Ryan winning
Dont worry about the lost Campbell,  you were the only one  to put this kid on the canvas 👏🏻
???)(?
@3:24🤣🤣
better head movement and the boy is golden.
next garcia vs lomachenko
What more if its lopez or loma garcia will got hit a lot
Canelo's punch. Throwing a hook to the face that is actually a hook to the  obliques. That's what he learned from him.
Garcia has all the hype but he needs way more head movement and footwork and defensive movement, right now he’s a standing target and someone will KO him.
Ryan took that punch like a true champ
Can’t wait until Tank gets his hands on him
Dallas Texas...
Mikey garcia ,Danny Garcia, and Ryan Garcia need to all fight each other in the battle of the Garcia’s
Algo extraño que siempre usará para atacar la derecha y cuando por fin usa su zurda lo deja en KO está pelea estaba más comprada que nada:(
Sad but reality Campbell has only one style not like Garcia he has a lot of initiatives skills that help him knocks Campbell.
I hope he waits till hes 24 to fight gervonta davis. I think thats where he will peak 21 is still young imo.
Funny how most of the comments are like 'people think' while everyone is just appriciating Ryan.
wait there was a crowd?
Canelo punch!
Porque nose le lanzó? En el 2do round a garcia🤔
canelo's style🤣
Ryan Garcia Body Challenge paid off
he hit him in the liver of course he is gonna fall.
LETSS GOOOO RYANNNNN
he got him with that Canelo body shot
Looser García
As a manny pacquiao fan with a high standards this young man can fight
As a manny pacquiao fan with a high standards this young man can fight
This dude is going to get decapitated by the elite of the division if he doesn't find better trainers quick. Poor head movement and footwork. He's still clearing the cab drivers in the division he's lucky to have escaped Luke Campbell let alone anyone a step or steps above!
Yo Ryan almost got slept 🛌 💀
*My music is gonna blow up this year.*
Peep
Garcia will loose soon
In boxing every one is a champion!
Garcia gots hands no doubt.
Jake paul: I’m the future of boxing  Ryan garcia: am i a joke to you?
if i was the one who got punched, I'll be dead after seconds.
Pacman is waiving
The future is bright
Ryan Garcia will be brutally KO’d...he’s defense is just terrible
King Ryan Garcia- Power, speed and no glass jaw.OUCH.....
ppl need to give him his props. Many including myself doubted him but he proved himself, excited to see what he does next
respect! that was awesome
Woah
i like the knockdown slowmo but none?
2:37 that knockdown remind me of marquez knocking pac in the earlier rounds in their 4th fight sending everyone to go ballistic
I can see this fight with an absurd ko and how Campbell had mercy to García, this with canelo's  two last bouts, both are just a fake
Even Floyd got knocked down so chill...
So Ryans weakness is his chin, he should strengthen his chin for the next fight, respect to Ryan Garcia from Philippines.
Tbh I wouldn’t mind Ryan v Loma before he fights tank
Esta verde este chamaco le falta mas entrenamiento
Easy for tank and teofimo
To those muppets saying oh he only 21 yo still in development and all of that s..t, hey youngsters, Wilfred Benitez was a world champ at 17 years old with 25 fights --- undefeated.
Muy raro ya le bolvio a tirar la isquierda y lo tuvo muchas veses a modo
💯❤️👍🏾
Check the views he got on highlights, ppv star soon
if the MMA / UFC runs out it's ryan
Mediocre & overated fighter!!!😄
Davis will knock him clean out. Haney will take him to school. Let’s not even talk about Lopez lol. He might have a chance with Stevenson though.
marami kapang kakainin bigas garcia bago ka tumapat kay manny pacquiao..kumain ka muna ng baguong at tamilok 😅
He still ain’t ready for Tank
Mahina pa ang panga kya tumba
Beautiful fight on both parts. Would love to see Tank VS Ryan.  The question is, if Tank caught him with a hook like that is Ryan still getting up?
Ryan needs to work on his leg movement if he wants to fight any of MMW team
Luke lucky charmbell
Slowmo - you can see the impact of that body punch. There were nerves that broke down
He needed to be knocked down atleast once he probably thought he was invulnerable but he got humbled
Tank will destroy this guy and he will not be able to handle the speed or the power that Tank has!!!
Amazing show from both fighters amazing fight for garcia for the title and now a named fight under his belt and campbell held with so much respect after the fight well done to both of them
Lesson Ryan
Ggyy
Get out loma fight this kid
Campbell gets afraid to let go. Garcia can be dropped .he punches a lot. but campbell is still there. Davis will capitalize on that. by staying in his face.with power punches
Ryan has a lot of promise
So does he belong to Canelo or Golden Boy Entertainmnet(Oscar)?
Tell Ryan to end  Rollies career next
If Garcia got hit like that 2:37 from Gervonta Davis, the fight would have been over.
Honestly body shots are more effective than anywhere else in fighting
Lol ko
Just Wow😮👌🏾💪
if you read this i hope you have a blessed day :)
Dude is trash, always flat footed, no head movement, and hands always down, at the same time this is the only time I’ve seen him fight, not impressed, would like to get in there with him and give him the business
argh! why didnt Campbell finish him off in the 2nd round :/ he took it easy after that knockdown he should have gone for the KO
Biden stole the election
Still not in the level of Teofimo and Tank. Maybe he can fight Haney next. That would be competitive
Over hyped garcia wants real competition looking to fight davis  i dont think so ,he didnt do to well with campbell davis will nock garcia out in less than 4 rounds
Are you sure Ryan you want to fight Manny Paquiao?? What will happen  if Mannys Left hand land on you ??
Campbell copy pacmans style when he knockdown Garcia. It was the very same move pac used against Keith in round 1.
Garcia’s speed is just insane 🔥
*Awesome highlights!*
That was a beautiful scrap
He is not ready for tank but I’d still like to see it 😭
That liver shot in the end kinda surprised me, I saw it hit him and for a sec I was like “wow he didn’t go down” then he went down and I was like ok there we go
Georvonta easily destroy Garcia
Ryan took the hit and got back up like nothing
I wanted Campbell to win this so bad, but man that body shot hit like a sledgehammer
Yeah yeah i see another felix verdejo to much hype until he begins to fights harder boxers then you’ll see him loose
I'm telling you, liver shot is best way to knock someone out.  Worse than a nut shot.
Cambel knew he is going to get knocked out, so he just surrendered.
why they can have crowd in the arena?
This kid is special, wish him much success and happiness throughout his career
Legend
That looked like a Canelo liver punch right there.
Luke looks 33 but 17 at the same time
That liver hook was clean af
Perfect body shot, great feint with the right hand to setup the left body shot
If Campbell knocked you out the davis the tank is going to hurt u I'm just saying keep you guard up
It's  funny  and  Ryan  called  out  Conor  McGregor
all this chin talk reminds me of tony ferguson chin he gets dropped but never ko. hope he has that granite chin or else it's night night
Tank is going to get a harder body punch.
Ryan is a beast!🥊
Ryan Garcia is an exciting fighter. He'll only get better.
Nope hi is not ready, not yet
Great KO. But i still think he has to train a little harder upon his weakness to get TANK. Like TANK has crazy head movements. And power too
This garcia kid is no where ready 4 tank or haney
Someone in the crowd yelled “f*ck you” at 3:25
💪🙏👏
I guess Ryan can take a punch. Campbell mistake is he didnt go after him right away. The next rounds ryan recovered. That body hit tho. He went on 1 knee then both he was hurt.
8:05 too fast looks like normal body punch.
Ryan vs Mungia 😉😉😉
Okay buddy we not gonna let that celebration slide 💀😂
Big props to Campbell he was down for the scrap
Chicken garcia..you will get knock out against  gervonta
that celebration is going in the history books for sure
float like water and relax the muscles then follow through like a knife lucky I know how to
Ryan Garcia is definitely a fighter. Would love to see how he fight Tank
Luke Campbell BRAVOO
...Apolo: Paris!...apunta alto, a la quijada..ahí!
Ryan Garcia down?!?!?
Luke shall hit one more punch before Ryan down in the second round.
Luke Cambell is a 5/10 fighter, Garcia looks class for his age but I think the Americans are getting a tad bit too excited glorifying this win.
Bro the liver shot💪🤤🤤🤤
Congrats to Ryan Garcia on the win but I don't see him winning against anyone after this fight. I was honestly surprised he won, i thought it would be a close fight but he got him. But all his future opponents are only going to get tougher and smarter and i don't see him progressing much from here.
Tank knocks Garcia out with that shot. He's not ready.
Esas si son peleas no como las de canelo
Ryan Garcia V Tim Tszyu Aussie boy will smack him up !!!
Campbell could have finished Ryan tho after the knockdown. 😅
Yeah I got hit and got knocked down but I got back up. I hit you so hard in temple you started run -Ryan Garcia
This match will remain in history
Ryan response to to getting rocked by that hook was awesome. You can see it on his face he nods like.... “yeah I got caught. Nice punch. Let’s do this”
Canelo looked proud after the body shot
TANK DAVIS BY ko  all day
the LEFT HOOK! NASTY!
7:40 that was just beautiful
Cool fight
Ryan the monster García...congratulation champ 🏆...
That ripple effect tho. Like tossing a stone in water lol
Woww.....awesome ....come back
Who is the announcer of this fight? DAZN should get Michael Buffer If he is the announcer, it is like a great fight happening
RYAN GAVE ME A HEART ATTACK!!!!
gervonta davis will knock him out
Gervonta Woman beater davis is next
👑 Ryan
García is truly next promes
It's just he has mexican blood
2:40 😭😭😟😟 now 7:30🥳🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊😎
who trained cambell some guy down the road a mate of his . Who trained garcia oh fk me it was canello alveres .big difference .And we dont do fighting over the water ,frank bruno amir khan, ricky hatton  prince nazzeem ,tyson fury ,smith another smith .some guy from sheffield .all spark out yes spark out  .Ok tyson got up .We just dont do it .Maybe in a few years joshua or ubanks junior will bring something home but not yet .Dont know why Eddie hearn puts these fight together .mad ..Hes just  like his dad Don king .
Garcia is a tough dude. Having heart and grit takes you a long way. But also Campbell was great as well in this. He is a crafty guy and can be a champion if he stays focused.
The kid got up, he showed balls in the second round. Fights are also won with intelligence, he needs to relax when he is winning.
5:11 wow
Ryan kingglass Garcia
Still too green in my opinion. I’ll be surprised if they try to fight Tank. I believe they will go after Devin Haney. They dont want smoke with the power punchers right now. Luke Campbell is not known for having power & he dropped him easily. My 2 cents.
Can Manny Paquio beat Ryan?
No Hate For Ryan Garcia But Ryan Garcia Needs To Fight Bigger Names
He's not yet ready for Tank nor Fimo.
Campbell tenía prohibido noquear a garcia
You should be able to spinning back fist in boxing, like it would def make some wild knockouts
Those are warriors fr
😳😳
USELESS
Ryan's gonna be a superstar I'm waiting
No one: Literally No One: Every punch: Pssh
Ryan Garcia will be kyod by Teofimo Lopez, he is still careless and flatfooted.
That was so fast 7:12
Watching that shockwave go through Luke’s abdomen in slow mo almost ruptured MY liver 😬
Yooooo he was out. Hitting the mat literally woke him up.
3:40 that chill on his right arm/tricep after he got hit only proves how hard he got hit.. deym!
Unfortunately the more I watch this, the more I can see it was fixed for Ryan to win.😥
I predicted Garcia would win,  but he would be exposed in a few ways, which is pretty much par for the course. I see Lopez and Davis beating him conclusively. Lopez would win by decision, and Davis by knockout.
F Pacquiao lands that left in his chin? night night baby
that celly kinda sus tho
That's a body shot challenge from ryan.
He ain’t ready for gervonta Davis
Looked like a liver shot. Why dont the announcers mention that?
No one can take a liver shot.
Manny should fight this kid. Easy money.
Un invento Ray García puro humo
He ended with one punch in his body
Poor ryan garcia you can't survived for those heavy hitter in his division campbell not having a 100 percent condition through covid 19
Garcia STILL NOT READY for  G.D 🦾
Ryan Un futuro Amir Khan.
How many people thought the fight was over when Ryan went down? I thought he wouldn’t even make the count. That was a bad knockdown. Credit to him for coming back.
😂😂 Garcia won’t ever forget that knockout🤣🤣
7:13 Canelo blueprint right there.
Who wants some free chum?
I hate to say this but either way. Garcia will most likely end up like Sta. cruz
*Gets knocked down once* “HiS defense WaS ExPoSeD”
Necesitan empezar a ponerles boxeador reales
All those bodyshot challenge videos paid off!
U are no match for pacquiao, do not dream much for that, u need many more food to eat. Hahahaha do not make me laugh ryan garcia ur a only a babay hahahahahawahahhaha
This was a beautiful fight, my heart was just on the rise.
Ryan’s the adesanya of boxing
I was like laying back on my bed than saw him get dropped stood up real quick thought he was ko'd
Ryan was like whoa did he just knock me down lol but no worries I got this !! Whoa go Ryan !!! Rep us Mexican Americans lol. Whoa !!
Why are they standing? Don't they know footwork? Not a hater but is that how young boxers fight now?
dat liver punch in the end was 🔥🔥🔥
Garcia got that Pacquiao stance/style. He moves and box like pac. Not bad tho.
I dont know the insight of boxing etiquette.. but why didn't Luke pounce on him straight after the knock down?
Tank will destroy this pretty boy
7:13 is where it starts
is Ryan Garcia exposed his weak chin like Amir Khan coz of his knocking out in 2nd round, Even Campbell is not an elite boxer??
"Every body has a plan until they get punched in the face" garcia got punched in the face and he still got a  Plan. A plan to beat Campbell and he did. 👊👊👊
oh my goodness that punch
Lol Logan and jake Paul would lose against been these guys
Dang imagine losing to a body shot
Great fight - kid came back well.
What a sicko
Listen DO NOT GET IT BY TANK DAVIS THAT WAY... Congratulations to Ryan G.
7:52 Lomachenko's body attack💪🇺🇦
Nah other guy should have pressured way more Ryan was just lucky in this fight
IM BILLY
I haven’t watched the video yet Ryan Garcia is going to win the fight hands down.
who won?
Ryan has no feet at all and his chins mad high when punching with his guard down. Little worrying for his future.  canelos influence is clear on him too he be standing in the centre flat footed like him. But ryan aint canelo
Man was tired
Just another one boxer TV  See the Tail of the Tape 11 yeara between them   Garcia part of Canelos + Hoya's teams
Ryan Garcia is now 21-0, 18 KO let’s goooo CHAMP👑
Mcgregor vs Garcia!
Canelo in the cut clapping like a proud watching his son chase greatness 🤗
Boom liver shot knokout
Now that was a  CRUSHING BODY SHOT!! Great job Ryan Garcia Viva México 🇲🇽 Cabronesssssss
A lot of people talking that if Garcia didn't land that body shot, he would've lost. Bro, y'all are dragging him down even if he's won them all. Now that he finished his real challenge, y'all still hating him. Saying things like he can't win if they reach the scorecards, bruh, he's winning those rounds except the 2nd. He was also landing those left hooks to the head the last few rounds, prolly why Campbell went on a high guard. He prolly knows better that he has a lot to work on if he wants to stay on top. Stay mad. Jealousy kills.
Flash got by a flash knock down
idk why this body shot looked more painful than his ko's
Once tank fights Ryan sorry but Ryan gonna lose
Tank will knock him out he has no defense Canelo needs to teach him sum head movement
You can see that canelo is helping Ryan with that mis direction left hook
Garcia stinks
Beautiful body shot
When we realize the root of the self is the movement of thought in time. When thought comes to an end that is a form of death while living. Every human being has identified himself and so conditioned himself.
Pacquiao vs Garcia 2021, who wins???
Who wouldn’t thought the liver shot would have ended Campbell, wow Garcia did his thing 🥊💯
After seeing this fight my money is on Davis (when they do fight) even tho Gracia won this fight, I think we can all agree if he gets hit by one of Davis’s uppercuts it’s night night for Garcia.. Just my personal opinion, I could be wrong. Both Garcia And Davis are great fighters especially for their age. Can’t wait till that fight happens. I think that fight will determine who really is the future face of boxing.
Lol. I'm pretty sure that guy he fought is a nobody. What's y'all argument now haters ?
All these pro commentators below lol. RYAN WON. GET OVER IT
first time ryan got knocked out
The Tank will knock out Garcia inside 5.....mark my words!
Let's go!
Garcia is not mexican. I dont know why they try to show him has  mexican, he hardly can say some words in spanish.
"try to get up from that" - Ryan Garcia 2021
Ist me or devin havey gonna destroy Ryan?????
NOT READY FOR TANK DAVIS
Água  da luta parabéns Ryan
Ryan reminds me of Wilder. Strong puncher, but have pretty glaring flaws. He gotta buck up on that coz one day his opponent will definitely capitalize on that just like Fury did to Wilder.
Este rayan ni en sueños le aguanta a gervonta Davis!!!!
5'10 at lighweight? This kid could potentially become a 5 or maybe 6 weight champ.
os this fight two days ago?
The first time both of them got knocked in their career 👌
Que bien que ganó!!! Pero me agrado más el volado de izquierda....que lo mando al pido .espero que crea que no es el mejor!!! Siempre habrá uno mejor que tú!!!
El alacrán se lo come entero y vomita los puros guantes!!!
This is the proub that Tank davis will easily nockout ryan
Tank will destroy garcia.... sorry 😐
It was canelo alvarez finishing move fake punch to the head then go to liver punch
22 vs 33
Garcia must stay put on his ko and fight tank Davies..not Pacquiao...Pacman will always move aroun not like King Ry...
man bro really took 4 body shots n came back with 1 ...
Luke made a mistake not being aggressive after that knockdown.
He is not beating Tank or Teofemo LoL!!!
Ese pasa cuando les van subiendo el nivel y eso campeell no trae mucho eso kiere desir que García no llegará muy lejos ya esté visto
Garcia Vs 🐻🇦🇱 reshat mati
The power of Ryan's punch is not 100 percent utilized because of his tiny legs. He should developed his legs like Manny Pacquiao.
Abb
Who wants to see jake paul vs Ryan✌️🥊🥊
Nobody can take that vicious liver shot
Respect Ryan garcia
Can we talk about that sus post fight celebration?
I like his heart but lil homie not ready for Tank frfr 🤷🏾‍♂️
Chocolitito vs El Gallo Estrada March 13!!
Garcia jumps into his punches   the kid hits harddd
This comment has absolutely nothing to do with this video🤣🤣 but I play the alto saxophone and posted a few new covers on my channel and would love it if you guys would check it out lol. Thank you in advance!! And great video btw!!❤️
That liver shot was on point no wonder he couldnt get up
Liver left the Chay respect for the other guy tho
I’ve watched this fight 3 times already...amazing technical fight!
Anyone else here wasn’t surprised when Garcia got dropped?. Still hats off to him tho got up and won. But to real boxing fans here we know he got exposed in this fight especially in his defense. No head movement and kinda flat footed. I think he needs 2 more fights to have a chance against Tank and Teofimo. Perhaps he should fight Linares next then Loma or Haney. If he wins both fight then he can take on either of two. But for me, if they want to make such big pay day like floyd/pac bout. They should wait a couple more years. Let the hype increase. they’re still young and not in their prime yet and also they should fight in 147-154 division. I think it’s the perfect weight for their fight. If he fights tank or Lopez next he’s going to lose..
Camebell does not know how to fight
Lil homie going places
Am i the only one who just noticed luke campbell’s extremely skinny legs 😭
Francis enganou apostou e levou muito dinheiro
Happy New Years!!!! Made a goal to stay consistent to help others with cutting hair here on YouTube 🔥💈💈💈💈
i swear ryan garcia was like a 18 a year ago
That's an effective liver shot
That's some bull
dude im so hyped for ryan holy
Campbell’s Internal organs: Oof
Whoever just goes to the comments to see who won its....     Ryan Garcia. Close match though.
This is why jake paul is scares lol
Just too intense sometimes, I literally clinch my jaws and then they hurt.  Stay safe, car hop trays from amazon
ي ربو ة ةة ئئ
Once the celebration is over Ryan needs to get back in that gym and fix those mistakes ASAP
is that just me or Ryan hit Campbell with a Canelo’s type liver shot in the 1st knockdown?
Great comeback for Ryan...but hopes he takes a few more fights before fighting the top dogs in the division. Right now they are on another level than him.
Chris Colbert is the future. Remember i said so!
What worries me is that although he has power and speed, he is flat footed, no head movement. Also, his punches are wild and he drops his hands everytike he throws. Teofimo, gervonta will probably put him down. Haney and stevenson would outbox him... of the 4 prospects hes probably the one who's behind in a technical stand point.
Unless you're GGG you gotta have some head movement. Someone is bound to KO him if he takes a shot like that again.
This guy is on ways the caliber fighter as Haney, Davis, or  lomachenko
Chale... el claro ejemplo de que el boxeo es más negocio que nada... Tanto talento en gimnasios de barrio y ahí arriba esos dos weyes que no dan nada de batalla
Bro needs to develop some defence Why hasn’t canelo taught him any head movements and footwork? Sheesh. He won this fight, but he’ll lose against better fighters if he doesn’t get some defence
Garcia va munguia
when did this happen
This fight did not make Ryan a superstar at least not yet.. Ryan chin is so high though.. He will get knocked down by top fighters.. Great win though.
King ryan vs white chocolate would definitely be the best fight
There was okay fight.
campbell still weakness at body..
Check my video I posted out let me know what y’all think? Like, comment . Thank you guys ! 🥊
Ryan is a beast now some people will actually respect you you prove your self 👍
I want that to happen to jake😂
what a fcking fight!!! Kid got knockout then comeback and knock him out on the ribs! Truly Ryan Garcia toughest fight!
Eso Es Lo Que Pasa Cuando Se Confian Mucho Fue Un Puño Limpio Y Cmo Kiera Se Levanto Es Un Guerrero Vamos Campeon 🤞💪
Pelea arreglada!!
135 pounder calling out a legend @147lbs improve your footwork first u wont handle a welterweight punch
A southpaw's Achilles heel.
Shaky chin for sure
Have to give Ryan Garcia his credit, he's a social media sensation who many believe got more credit then he deserved. Kids as talented as it gets, you don't just casually beat an elite boxer like Campbell with a body shot KO after being put down. What impressed me more then his actual win, was how he reacted to getting dropped, he didn't look shocked, he didn't look scared, he just took it on the chin (literally) and kept composure
Scrsnl
fixed????
He's asking questions..🤣🤣
(*!*) Who's here 2020 to 2021 I have survive Corona, did u? Kid got heart...
Nice Fight
Very disappointed
Los que saben de Boxeo preguntó. No fue estilo kawashi esta pelea....?
What a body shot lol
Amir khan's chin!! Daym haha And when you focus only on punch but not in footwork 🤣
Bro who picked the thumb nail 😂
Tik tok boxee
Ribs have left chat
I just didn't see the heart in boxing from Campbell.
No jab ryan?
Is it just me ir that body shot looked a lot like Canelo's? The angle and execution just looked the same for me.
Tank would have broke his neck
Great fight....nice to see the Instagram boxer get some competition
My last name is Campbell this hurt me man :(
Didn't tank beat Ryan? Is this old?... I'm lost
I'm praying on garcias first loss
Ryan carcia almos lose and hay was like wats
He showed EVERYONE
WITH STYLE LIKE THAT, GARCIA WILL DEAD IN TEOFIMO LOPEZ HAND'S. FOR SURE!!
Kingry is a true legend of the sport. Idol Kingry hide Gervonta, Haney, Teofimo, Loma, Shakur, Crawford, old man Pacman  Greetings from the Philippines 🇵🇭
I'm sorry but this commentary is so biased
Don’t let this distract you from the fact canelo would destroy Floyd Mayweather after years of progress since the first fight
Devin will destroy this kid
Bryan Garcia is like Amir Khan. There all have glass ching. When he fight Gravonta Davis it will be an dezaster for him..
this requires a rematch, before you go with manny
As quick as Garcia is, he lack head movement. He might end up like Amir "king" Khan if doesn't change that soon. Tank Davis might knock him out.
La ultima pelea del canelo
Rayan on fire 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
He got Campbell right in the liver what a beautiful shot
Ryan no esta preparado para gervota Davis
his most formidable opponent yet! great fight
Por fin una buena pelea, veo a estos  cabrones y los comparo con con el canelo , y digo "canelo eres una mamada "
What a great fight
That's canelo move that make campbell on his knees
I think his ribs is broke
oooookaaayyyyy
i AM the AIR your mom (breathe) lie detector brain scan failure is instant d3ath I AM YOUR mom's BLANKET I never typed this. I own the universe
As a black guy who only listens to rap, I enjoyed this.
Dazone has the worst commentary ever it's pathetic.
*Liver shots man...* _sheesh_ 😳
Hhhaaaa....low class opponent's garcia is not a superior fighter i gave him rating no.6....its same with AMIR KHAN...chop my ball if im not mistake i asure...you.could only short career..
Canelo stile !
Yeah no one can take a liver shot
he wants to fight pacquiao? he should focus on speed and footwork many is a heavy puncher you're too young for Pacquiao.
Lenares knockdown Loma. Loma knockout lenares with body shot Campbell knockdown Garcia. Garcia knockout Campbell with a body shot. Yup I seen this B4.
In my town 🤯
Wow ! What a nice job👊
shattered ribs
At least Ryan Garcia won plus he breaks Campbell ribs
He won't get up when tank and theofimo hit him I promise!
Those calves 😂
nah why Campbell look like he was born yesterday, mans is 10 years older than me and I swear he looks 12, I need that skin routine asap
Now we know Jake Paul wasn't faking
En cámara lenta se ve que es un golpe durísimo 🙁
2:39
Liver shot
2:38
Hope he learns from the knock down and he still needs more experience
2:40
if this is ufc Garcia is dead 😂😂
Garcia ain't ready yet for Teofimo or Tank.
Ryan is still very inexperienced and this fight showed it. His lead foot was always on the inside making it difficult to pull off a lead right. Even though his preferred weapon of choice is a left hook, when facing a southpaw, setting up the right hand proves more effective on southpaws. and stepping in like that with the lead foot on the inside, he just set himself up for future hazards especially when he doesn’t tuck his chin properly. it’s these mannerisms that Eddie needs to detect early on and correct. this will define Ryan’s career. However, it is up to Ryan if he is going to learn from this fight and reinvent himself or not. Amir khan had fast hands, but he never learned to protect his chin. Most often than not, Khan would just bolt in and try to overwhelm opponents with his combos. When he fought fighters that had better timing and placement, he got exposed as a one trick pony.  Great comeback though considering Ryan’s experience. props to him.
I like Luke a humble man
7:30 el otro fraudulento
He took the bodyshot challenge
experience knockdown and still win the fight.
haha "they're pretty boys w a mean streak"
To be fair, Ryan Garcia has done Great here.
Did any one see Garcia have like a back hand in second round. Goldeneye
This is real boxing, no hugging and running.
Nice liver shot
Let’s goooo! Ryan 🥊🙌
i remember hopkins throwing that kind of punch on dela hoya 😂😂😂😂
Maybe garcia won't be as cocky next time thinking he ain't gonna get dropped
When Ryan got knocked out, my face was like 😮  I was scared that Ryan was going to be defeated and that his undefeated title will go away.  But nope! He fought and won! I'm so happy Ryan won.  Great job to Luke Campbell too. He put up a great fight!   Ryan put up a great fight as well, ofc! :)  :)
He will be a legend
Got hit with a clean left hook with his mouth wide open, anyone will go down in that situation. Gotta learn from Oscar and clench that jaw
Everyone's talking the boxing and I'm over here wondering how many people gonna get the Vid in that crowd. Spent the entire video counting 'no-maskers'.
Ryan tough. Mad respect for the hard work
1:03 bruh ryan was that a superman punch
The well-made arm possibly prefer because grade conceptually mine behind a threatening cheek. valuable, whispering lan
Be Humble! Sit down! 🔥
Is Ryan the new Mayweather?
Gervonte Davis would beat Ryan Garcia
Garcia did well but he isn’t unbeatable and the first knock down shows that. Don’t really like him anyway but he is doing well
Ryan Garcia is a beast
mans sharp af
These are the fighters to bring boxing back to its glory
No mas after that shot!
That hit was clean asf with a little mean streak behind it
ok, Ryan. congrats! but... wait till you see the boy from Newark. or that kid from Baltimore
The next fight against a better oponent will be the big test for the emotional but very watchable Ryan Garcia.
Young legend 🐐😤😤
Both guys are awesome fighters! 👍
I could beat up ryan garcia easy
This kid garcia have glass chin. His mental will not be same after knocked down like that
All I know is if gervonta lands with one of those shots Ryan's gonna go sleep 👀
Luke campbell focus only to defence her face but her body is open
Not impressed with either of these guys.  Garcia stands to strait and stiff and not much defense.  Leaves his chin wide open far to often.  He'll get ko'd hard like Kahn by someone.
Who else thought Ryan Garcia was gonna lose?
No ones going to talk about that around 3:20 Ryan Garcia threw a punch that didn’t land, got mad and swung it back to create some space?....plus his body went behind him=k.o.....hell of a fight but I think Campbell got cheated...
The power of the Gazelle punch
No paro de ver ese gancho, pero ojalá que pierda ese Garcia por crecido y prepotente
Ryan garcia
Full fight???
Amazing fight. Ryan Garcia shutting up the haters
Y'all going to see thats pacquiao  technique right hand to the body so the opponent would drop his guard down and then boom throwing the left hand.
Naku. Ryan muna maghamon sa mfa welterweight elite, ur to young pa. Experience muna, kulang pa . Iimprob muna yong style mo, para makamit mo yong gusto mo. Too early for MP.
Shout out to Luke for trying...if he was a lil stronger Ryan wouldn’t have gotten up from that knock down....
This fight same like the fight between Lomachencko vs Linares
Manny Pacquiao could teach this kid, hands down, a walk in the park. 🤔
Props to my favorite young fighter 🤑
And he wants to fight the pacman .. 🤣😂🤣🤣..
This was a great learning experience for Ryan. Always too confident
Campbell loss concentration there.Leaned in for a breather then got caught.
No mamen pinche boxeador entro por dinero y al último se tomo fotos hahahahaha pura chingada mafia
Pésimo boxeador García
Don't let this distract you from the fact that  Hector is gonna be running 3 Honda Civic's  with spoon engines. On top of that he just  came into Harry's and ordered 3 t66 turbo's  with NOS's and a Motec System Exhaust. 🍕
Ryan has no chance against Tank.
Great fight, worst commentary I have ever listened to I turned it off after round one...
RYAN GARCIA IS NOT READY FOR THE PACMAN!
Hajime no ippo? xD
Ryan could be the next AMHIR KHAN...GLASS CHIN IS EXPECTED..FLAT FOOTED....
fake !!!!!!!!
RYAN GARCIA IS AMIR GLASS CHIN KHAN OF BOXING EXCEPT WITH MORE POWER!
Hurts my liver just watching that.
Someone was bound to hit with that hook his face is always open
And Jake Paul wants to vs this
Yo these dudes weight 135 and i weight freakinf 158 and im 5 6 😐😐
Son un vergüenza para el boxeo tu y canelo
Ok
You want a southpaw? Eat that sneaky left overhand
PACQUIAO WOULD KNOCK RYAN GARCIA OUT!
Nice fight
Campbell should have attacked when he knocked him down. Warrior Spirit
You just barely escaped Ryan let this fight prove to you that you're definitely not ready to face Gervonta Davis
Atleast b4 the body shot he experience knockdown in 2nd round!
Why does luke campbell look like that 1 kid who forgot his p.e kit and ends up using his school shoes 😂
I reckon Campbell made a mistake by not going after him after the drop!! Campbell should have unleashed superb shots right after the drop,anyway a great fight to watch!!
a la mecha
Sounds like that announcer was a little bit against Garcia
Ryan garcia overrated
Americans are just too cringe for me.
Ryan Garcia should've been more humble in the End when he won. Luke had slept that fool. 3:30
so now we have 3... THREE 3!!!!! WBC champions..... c'mon man ( J. Biden Voice)
Luke just doesn't have the killer instinct .
2:37 Down goes Frazier!
That guy looks way younger than 33
luke could have broke him if he had jumped on him after the 8 count
Everybody is a boxing coach now in the comments
I felt every left hook that connected
Not Hater. But Ryan's lack of head movement and being flat footed his big problem. So much room fot improvement. More expernce for the kid
Now we know he's like fighting to protect the China vase chin... Campbell is not a puncher and still dropped the King 👑 lol 😂 Imagine Tank landing the same punch. TIMBER!!!! Tank can walk inside with ease cause that jab of Ryan is so random it creates no issues. Once inside its clobbering time. Ryan will wake up in 2022! Canelo will be holding him like like a baby. 😂👶👑
Can someone explain why there are so many empty seats? Like full rows empty, etc?
Ryan fought like a champion and proved a lot of people wrong ✊🏼 , but tbh I still don’t think he could beat gervontaa 🙁 !!
He wants Manny
This is the first time i Saw Ryan drop
Garcia will be another Amir Khan - fast but glass chin. Tank will eat him alive, no problem.
LoL in Teofimo, Davis, Haney are the best on the league, Ryan doesn't have the caliber, i hope he grow more before he faces Teo or Davis. The kid got  potential though.
Garcia was exposed by a B-Level fighter. Tank and Haney destroy him. Lol.
People are gona say its a fixed fight and he lost on purpos but i dont think he could havr goten up from a accurate punch to the liver i mean look at this 07:39
If tank landed that it would have been over
Apparently Ryan Garcia doesn’t know how to fight
All the comments about garcia but let's not discredit luke... What a fight.. But garcia is the real deal
I honestly am lost for words on why luke campbell didn’t jump on Ryan Garcia when he dropped him , the kid would of been dazed and a little dizzy . If you watch any boxer with experience they always jump on them as soon as the word go , throwing knock out punches everywhere . Luke could of won that and his name would of whent worldwide as the underdog 👏🏼   You don’t need experience to know to jump on somone after they drop
well hopefully he improves, he needs to.
If Ryan Garcia learns the Jab and patience like on Juan Manuel Marquez he will be deadly.
He looked like Canelo in that 7th round
Garcia is overrated
🥊🥵🇲🇽🇩🇴
Ryans footwalk, head movement.. defence in general needs upgrading. Tank would sleep THIS ryan within 3 rounds. His conditioning was a1 perfect for this fight. 5/10 % less he would could of struggled with getting up
De donde es
Campbell needs leg day
He get knocked down for the first time in his professional career and everyone is acting like he got exposed from it 😂😂😂 He did get rocked pretty well from an elite boxer though. To me, it’s impressive af that he ended up continuing with the pressure and getting the knockout
Garcia expose Campbell
Almost looked like nate 😂😂😂
I give my respect to campbell no cap.
Okay.... Tank will for sure win!
he's one of the best boxer in the world right...
Ryan was lucky that luke is not like pacquaio..if pacquaio beat his chin ,he wiĺl sleep early as hatton
What gloves is Luke using? The company?
Just need to add a legs on Garcia's style...
His defense is very shaky but for him to bounce back from that knock down took alot of heart! Well done!!
With the performance like that. Garcia Can't win to Manny.  Garcia Need to eat 20 sack og Kalamunggay and 1 tons of rice to fight manny pacquiao
Garcia got lucky in this fight! He aint ready for tank or Santa Cruz
Ryan just learn the floor is the limit, not the sky
Ryan almost lost that
Lets see if he can handle a solid experienced straight Left from Pacman.
The next amir khan,,RYAN GARCIA,,🤣🤣🤣
Liver shot
King Ryan🥊🥊🥊
there hands are so fast I don't know if they hit or not
Its very subtle, but i noticed Ryan has a short temper slightly
A counter right will put Ryan to sleep
He cant handle Tank Davis!..
What a body shot! Canelo-like behind that shot.
European - England or British fighters are way to soft compared to Fighters from the American continent
campbell doesn't have that what they called killer instinct. he doesn't run out to garcial while he's not yet recovered
Fast hands but no foot work
Campbell would’ve won but that body shot Garcia got was insane.
That body shot was just perfect
Cmon that countdown was 2 seconds to fast. Same time as the Fury drop.
That liver punch is the death of every champion, doesent matter how tough you are
Who's the southpaw?
Cayo como trapo
He better leave tank alone
GREAT VIDEO EDIT🔥  2 great fighters!!
Amir Khan 2.0
It’s impressive he got up. But he ain’t getting back up if that came from tank h
You can see him rocking side to side after he went down, yup that’s pain , but mr Ryan got lots more to learn , the head shots oh yeah wide open
Had punch come from tank, ryan you have could lost the fight in round 2.Improve your foot work.
The step into the body shot just made it stronger, great fight
I think if ryan add footwork in his arsenal he can be Pacquiao (not literally) but what i mean to say is that he's got a lot of speed with his hands so he needs to practice using his footwork more often
Great fight..
Who are the commentators?
@5:08 Campbell trying to do it again, Ryan already prepared a counter. Campbell saved by the bell.
Always held his head high when throwing punches..chin is exposed..
The fact that Ryan Garcia kept his composure and took the punch like it was nothing, that amazes me. That type of punch brings down a lot of boxers. And he wasn't even dizzy after that and still going on the offensive few moments later.
Garcia has no chance with monster Tank...
Jake Paul awaiting be like...
Who wants Gacia VS Davis? Cant wait to that fight.
Bruh why would u have the kid rocked and not try to finish him like didn’t even try, even when he knocked him down he looked scared instead of excited. I’m just saying Ryan Garcia is probably one of boxing’s biggest cash cows and the fact the dude went down for 10 seconds after a body shot definitely fishy
3:53 split counter entry.. that is pacquiao's bread and butter counter technique.. he's been doing that all through out his career.. just like the dela hoya and rios fight.. those fight were the best examples of the split counter entry.. and this kid wants to fight pacquiao? LOL!
You'd think he just KO'd Muhammad Ali with those crazy celebrations.  Completely over the top.
He's not ready for a real fight. Golden boy knows it
I got Devin Haney beating Ryan Garcia
Ryin carcia shp him in the liver thats wy he lost that havento hurt but ryan carcia all the way
Tank’s power will leave Garcia flat on his back😳
Must develope his foot work to improve his defense
Are those just celebs in the stadium or did they just not sell tickets at all
That liver punch offfff
I swear I didnt even know how old was luke, hes 11 years older than garcia!!!!   MAD.
To think that this kid is not in his prime yet. They said the same thing on Inoue getting exposed, y'all don't know adjustment right?? Y'all think Garcia's not gonna evolve after the fight? Y'all crazy  P.s the crowd makes difference on the excitement of entertainment sports
Fixed Fight IMO..   Glad Garcia got humbled in the 2nd RD.
Dazn messed up the intros again! And why can't they give translation from the coners - only did it towards the end. Garcia is heading for the top.
Campbell had it after the KO.  He didn't want to come get him , idk why. He didn't finish it , Ryan got lucky
Esta nuevo el muchacho no se equivoquen con el tanque Deivi
Bro his head is always open. I reckon if he verses Tank hes getting put to sleep.
Commentry Was a joke
Other than punching hard. What skill does Garcia have 😂🤔
I feel bad for Campbell man, Ryan is 10 years younger but has about the same record and experience than him? 20 pro fights, same height and reach? I mean, what has Campbell being doing in the last 10 years that a newcomer like Ryan is basically in the same level as him?
Was that paid. ???????
That last Body shot was cleannnnn
The haters before Ryan fight: Ryan is only fighting bums. Luke will be a real contender  The haters After Ryan fight: needs work, not ready for tank. Any real fighters for Ryan?
FULL FIGHT WHEN?
Wp rayan
Is Luke elite or not they said he is 🤷🏾‍♂️ so this a big win for Ryan
I see another Fernando Vegas here, he’s getting to cocky before winning a big fight.
Ryan needs more work on his defense he  gets hit alot but kid definitely got heart, he can make history in boxing hes got some power punches that no one is able to take twice or even once if connected right
He needs to use his jab more and stop jumping back lowering his hands, that why he got dropped.
Campbell have skill and talent but he wasn't have that heart of a champion like a true warrior like garcia have.
All the thumb downs are all the people who who went for Campbell lol.
0:56 I got so confused about the bell sound at first....
I like the kids talent but he still has a lot to learn
😂😂😂instagirl had 0 defense
Victor Ortiz or Chavez JR would have stayed down on that 2 round knockdown. Maybe he needs a little more polishing but you can’t deny even his haters watch his fights boxing greatness aside he is very exciting to watch.
Heavy hitter for sure he is small but has ruthless aggression mixed with speed & timing he is clearly an offensive threat to any challenger but the questions are in his defence and now in his chin. Minimal head movement mixed with flat feet. An equally aggressive fighter like tank will make him pay if he doesnt immediately start improving that. It was an awesome watch!
can someone tell me why theres a crowd when theres a pandemic?
He got down and he thought.. Wait I dont have Amir khan's chin! Lets go!
Face off glass: Am i a joke to you?
cambell skipps leg days
Rocky Fielding, Liam Smith and Luke Campbell. Who's the next British victim of Team Canelo's body shots?
Oof, that liver punch.
#1 trending on youtube
He said call an ambulance but not for me 😈
CANELO ENCOURAGED
Barley got the win Ryan’s nowhere near boxers like tank
Tank: It's free real estate.
I thought he was over after that nasty knocked down at 2. What a come back.
The best part of the fight was ryan getting knock down lol
Garcia beats Haney Tank beats Garcia  Teofimo beats all Loma?, think he's too small. Like he showed against Teofimo
The referee is familiar. Hahahahahaa
garcia ain't got no defence🤷‍♂️
Garcia v tank Davis.  What’s the hold up on this fight.
I hate how everyone defends ryan, you need to take criticism in life. It's the only way you can improve.
if tank hits him like that he isnt getting up
I have been following Garcia's career for a time now and I am glad that he beat luke campbell. That said, I don't see him beating teofimo or davis as of now. Maybe in a couple of years he will reach the level of the elite in the lightweights
Ryan's hooks are so obvious. You can see it coming from a mile away
Why did i enjoy that ryan dude get knock down so much 😂
If another Pacquaio will rise, he can knock out Garcia. If that person moves and punch with the same power and speed.
He needs to learn how to bob and weave  gervonte would catch him
le da un golpe al borde del ko y no lo contraresta q paso hay campbell esoo se viooo mal y mas en el boxeo
Imagine that was a tank hit whose known for KO power mmm wander if you be up
Tank is somewhere laughing...
2:38. wew
Ryan "Big Mouth" Garcia  Teofimo will destroy that punk
campbell guve him chance to recover he should push his limit to knock him out after that round...its a win loss situation
He’s literally a mini Oscar, I need a DNA test asap
Got to give the young man the respect he deserves, that was a heavy knock down and he got up and done the business 👊
Un golpe de suerte
Garcia definitely not ready
03:38 if that punch came from tank or teo he would be out cold ..
Campbell was tryna knock the wind outta him going for the body shots
He still has to fight rolly soon
Canelo gave him all his secrets lol
If this was a street fight, Campbell would have won.
Luke Campbell se vendio neta luego se mira lo , pudo aver terminado cuando lo tumbo y no lo iso neta....
Campbell can book. Very smart boxer. Technical.
Kneel to the king🤣🤣🤣
That’s a beautiful fake out hook to bodyshot
5:10 with more time that would have been a KO
Is Joe Rogan commenting boxing right now?
Honestly Ryan should be grateful to have Canelo as his mentor
Garcia need practice his footwork More
Ryan is not ready for, Tank ...Ryan needs to be more composed and not rush to get a KO, Campbell was way to open and , Garcia was lucky that he did not hurt his arm from being knocked down his first time around. Definitely going to be interesting to see, Garcia fight solid contenders in the future.
No trae nada el chavo, así se lo van a llevar inflando lo nada más!!
I wonder how would Garcia fare against Teofimo Lopez.
Ryan has glass chin???
Of course this is all Ryan’s highlights😂
It was set up
That's what's up bro congratulations
Ryan is 21 and people are talking about he makes rookie mistakes lol. He’s 21 he hasn’t even finished developing and he’s made it this far he’ll be fine
Ryan got dropped like a little baby impala. He doesn’t have the chin!!! And tank hits harder than Campbell. Pa uno hay otro!
The commentary on this fight was awful. In fact Boxing on DAZN is poor all around imo
2:40 it looked over he was legit on all 4s for a moment
We just gonna ignore the fact that Luke Campbell is 33 years old ..
Shoutout to Canelo for that body shot.
Don’t care what nobody say he not beating Haney or Shakur  💯
Looks like someone was paid to lose.
Garcia vs Haney needs to happen
Ryan is not going to last as undefeated.He has the same chin as Fernando Vargas.
He will remember that KO for the rest of the life
Would’ve been ko’d in the ufc from that knockdown
As much as I do like Garcia. He did get some of weaknesses exposed at bit my eyes
That left hook tho
I’m glad he kneeled down ngl cause ive yet to see someone keep going after that hard of a hit to a rib cage
Subscribing to anyone who subscribes to me
Did Campbell  make a mistake by not going on the attack after the knock down? should have pressured him after that knockdown
Prediction: tank knocks out Ryan Garcia
I’m glad this is trending. Such a BADASS fight!!!🥊🥊
If he lost It would’ve been funny cause the entrance
Why aren't they wearing a mask?
No way gracia will take a punch from tank
Ryan did not win this fight.  He caught a Two hit piece that sat him down Twice. Ain't no way he won.
Just imagine if that hit was by teofimo, tank, or haney🤦‍♂️
Why does Campbell look like he’s 17
Everyone has been waiting to see how Ryan reacts to getting hit. People predicted he would have a glass jaw like Amir khan, but the way he took it was pretty solid.
Another hypejob got exposed  If tank hits him like that he ain’t getting up
I want pizza 🍕
Believe in Jesus Christ and you will be saved! Amen!!
Ryan Garcia vs Tank Davis please
Hate to say this but I have a little more respect for Ryan here ...
Liver punches man...
Last shot was probably a liver shot. He prob couldn't get up even if he wanted to.
He needs to fight his dad for settling him up
Bsxaj
Ryan pulled out that body shot challenge to end it haha
all he need is a better gas tank and better defense/ footwork and that boy nasty
Ryan still got it
That liver shot will take down any man...
He is immature
y'all go watch this video @t​
He don't have a defense
Yeah ... he forsure broke some ribs
Say what u want......Luke throws pillows compared to Davis.  Ryan wouldn't have made it out that rd
Tank will KO Ryan
DERRRRRR I'm YouTube
Man at the end of the fight he act like he won the lottery he needs to wake up in a real fight with a real beast he won't last
7:37 no one gonna talk about the ref's expression when that hit landed? haha
Tank will knock him out
This fool ain’t ready for tank Ryan still a baby
Can we get him to fight fighters like Tank Devas, Teofimo Lopez, or better yet with the same age Devin Haney? But props to both fighters coming into this match.
Someone needs to really look out for this kid he is not ready for tank and im not a tank fan temo will destroy tank rayan is not ready
He said ima take a quick nap
Look at my pfp
This a real fight everybody can’t be touchless
This is real fight
Great fight.
Garcia is way to flat footed, his body is straight all the time. He needs to work on those skinny legs to have more body movement
In 2019, the U.S. debt will exceed 22 trillion, in 2020, the U.S. debt will exceed 27.5 trillion, an annual growth of 5.5 trillion! In 2021, the U.S. debt will exceed 30 trillion! However, 30 trillion is the limit of the U.S. debt! The end of the U.S. economy bubble  is coming!
As someone who only watches MMA this boxing match was amazing.
Pound for pound best in his weight class, kid got knocked down on the canvas came back up and knocked out luke Campbell with a body shot to finish it up.... Campbell even said that’s the hardest he’s ever been hit...
Ryan garcia is a joke!! He doesn't defend himself . What a joke
Liver shots are no joke
That body shot hurt me just watching it.
so who won?
Everyone talking bout how he doesn't have a chin.. Did y'all see how hard he got hit and how he immediately got back up... Try getting punched that hard in the face and getting up from it lol
Lol the comments.
No trías nada García el sabe keno está listo para los demás
Luke peleo con miedo, cuando lo tumbó debió de arrematarlo y no lo realizo, le faltó mucha agresividad y empuje
3.27 got me laughing
Buy Dogecoin now before it’s too late 🐕🚀🌙💵💯💪
Leave Haney and Tank alone Ryan lol
I see now Ryan is not a scary fighter!! He showed a lot in this fight I’m rockin with him now!!!
Floyd punching the air right now
Is this sport still evolving? There are techniques I've never seen before
Ese García no tiene nada de técnica
He won't be so pretty if he doesn't learn how to dance mambo and guard his pretty face Campbell made the big mistake of not finishing him after that knock down 😎
Ryan’s most lethal weapon is his left hand
Salute to winning however he aint ready for DAVIS YET
Ryan is a fast sloppy fighter. He always goes goes for the fast haymaker hooks. Someone who knows how to fight up close would definitely beat him
Anybody else find it weird how scared luke looked when he knocked down ryan ?
Boooo
Gervonte Davis will knock Garcia the f*ck out. Garcia is over rated.
NO ES GALLO PARA EL CANELO.. YA LE ENCONTRARON EL BOTÓN Y EL CANELO SI LO NOQUEA..
Broke his rib with that one ouch
All props to ryan for getting up coming back and getting the W BUT if that was Tank idk if he getting back up ...
Paid fight
What happened there lul 7:34
Ryan is not ready for "Tank" Davis. 😆
What looked better Haney or Gamboa or,, Garcia vs. Campbell...???? Come on nowwww
What a weird celebration, the helicopter spin....🤷🏻‍♂️
He can’t beat tank Lopez of Haney not yet maybe later in his career
Ref should have let Campbell keep going .   Js
Love the left hook knock down Luke Campbell did. But that Ryan garcia liver shot was brutal.
Ryan all the way but i am glad he did get dropped, that will teach for coming out like an idiot being carried around.
Luke Campbell had a shot at finishing him but didn't follow up. Cost him the fight.
2:45     Sit down.........bee humble....-Kendrick Lamar
I’ve watched this video way to much times
What a great match Ryan Garcia is awesome.
That overhand left is why southpaw is dangerous
He is NOT ready for Tank
First time being knocked out
Y todavía dicen que el boxeo actual es un circo dónde Reyna la corrupción
If that was tank that caught Ryan chin it would’ve been wraps
still not impressed!!
I don't know anything about boxing. Entertaining fight.
Im so happy he got knocked down. He needed to experience that.
Ryan Garcia i knew it my favorite fighter
7:12
2:36
Weak
Yeah Tank will eat this kid
I haven't seen any of his speedy hands,  is it because of gain weight or what happened?
so, what girl did he end up bringing to the fight?
😭😭Perfect body shot right on the liver.
He ain’t ready for Gervonte
Davis would beat this kid
ryans actually a power puncher. I thought he was a fast accurate fighter but hes more of a power puncher can put some speed in his shots but he loads heavy on them
Imagine if tank did that lol he won’t get up
Kids not a champ 💀he’s a interim champ he beat a journey man Campbell
That's canelo liver punch 👊 💪💪🔥
Garcia didn’t know how to react when he got dropped so he was Embarrass u could tell he was heated just by the way he was punching
Congrats to Garcia, but despite losing, Campbell proved why Garcia can roll with the likes of tank, Lopez, etc just yet.
He was hard for him i imagine 🥴
read my name or else i will eat your cookies.
Body shot!! 🥊
Ryan fights in light weight and has never been hit!!!
yoo he got popped
Ryan Garcia chin = Amir khan 2.0
15 years ago neither of these two would be top 10 and would have several losses mma has stolen almost all of boxing future talents these are all b level boxers
This dude is so over rated, first time he gets hit on the chin and drops down.
Can we really say Tank woulda finished him though? Ryan needs to move his head more and stop circling toward the power hand. Tank dropped a respectable fighter Gamboa but one of the weakest chins I ever saw lol. Dropped him in round 2 didn't finish him. Round 8 didn't finish him finally round 12 finished Gamboas old weak chinned self lol. Gamboa was one of my favorites about 7 years ago but I use to get mad cause he always got dropped.
I remember seeing round 5 and the end. I had my money money king ry, and Campbell was going to win the round, i remember telling my brother(who bet on Campbell)  that he was ahead and Garcia needs a flurry or something to steal the round, and sure enough, he got it!!
I see autozone 🤣
Garcia showed the HEART OF A CHAMPION HATS OFF TO THIS KID  ANY BODY THAT CLOWNS HIM FOR GETTING KNOCKED DOWN IS AN IDIOT AND AN EVEN BIGGER IDIOT IF YOUR A BOXER IF YOU DISCREDITED  WHAT GARCIA DID HE GOT UP FROM A KNOCK DOWN NOT A KNOCK OUT ITS LIKE LIFE YOU MAY GET KNOCKED DOWN BUT IT WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU GET UP GARCIA GOT UP FROM A KNOCK DOWN AND KNOCKED CAMPBELL  OUT WITH A BODY SHOT CONGRATS  TO RYAN GARCIA
He got hit with a great shot
Pls don’t ever disrespect “The Tank” by comparing rg to him 🤦🏽‍♂️👨🏽‍🦯
All the dislikes are from haters
never liked garcia dude is cocky
💪🇲🇽trai sangre azteca🇲🇽💪 este campeón
Man really said “ call the ambulance..but not for me 😈”
🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽💪💪💪💪🥊🥊🥊
Man I called it. I told little bro he’s gonna send that left hook to the body because dude isn’t going to give up his face
One thing i notice about Ryan this fight that he needs to not let fighters do is step outside of his lead leg. Any elite boxer with movement wouldve used that angle he kept giving away and destroyed him for it. He NEEDS TO STOP THAT. Great KO though
Footwork and head movement. That's basically defense and position. He needs that, badly.
Tank will smoke him
I dont care what people think of Garcia, at least he's bringing attention to boxing
Hopefully they have a rematch that will be a fight to see
That slow mo punch. I felt that
Ryan garcias name is going to be heard in boxing an beyond well into his 30’s he has the goods if he stays focused
He can’t beat Haney or Tank
NOVATOS!!
Goodboxerstilllearning
Was a awesome fight🤛
Clenelos student Ryan Garcia, is an OVERRATED cupcake. Only reason he knocked out Campbell with a body shot is because he's on Clenbuterol.
Hey fans! I invite you to visit Ro Lyss and SUBSCRIBE, please.
PELEA ARREGLADA!!! QUE POCA
Ryan low-key got expose
Campbell did the same thing Canelo did in one of his fights
So I don’t pay attention to boxing that much but all this time was Ryan fighting has been’s or amateurs
Yh u got to get some more weapons for tank ryan
Jack Paul take 3 of them hook from Garcia with no glove and he still fine. Didn’t even fade him.
Isn't that how hopkins dropped de la hoya??? 🤔
He has no chin but golden boy productions is going to figure out a way to make him into a super star. De La Hoya is the most corrupt individual in boxing today
Dude foot work is sloppy poor balance he could of got him if he switched feat so many times
Check out the freestyle on my channel
that hook is of team canelos playbook
This kid not near to being a match for tank!!!
That kid got heart. Only got stunned for a second in that second round drop
I think we a lil spoiled watching canelo fight thinking ryan is the same level as him
Ryan’s fall was scary I thought he would have stayed down but he got up before red could start counting
Just shows how weak Garcia’s chin is
Give Garcia his props he a warrior a lot of people think he just a "pretty boy" but that knockdown show's he's gonna fight as long as he in the ring
👊Aztec 👊
BRO the liver shot hits different
Kinda reminds me of a young Oscar. I think ryan can be a  fighter but he needs to be more. Love or hate oscar, he fought everyone. Fights he had no business being in
Gracia 🥳🥳❤️❤️❤️🥵😂🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🥰🥰🥰🥰♥️♥️♥️♥️

you didn't search for this its #1 trending
Smh if it wasn’t for that shot it was OVER FOR GARCIA
This kid is coming up at a rough time  A lot of killers in this weight class
This dude ain't NOWHERE near ready for Davis, or Haney! FOH
Why did they stop the fight if he got up at 9? That makes no sense.
Great fight
he ate that hit tho
That body shot looked real painful to 😬
He won but not a match for Davis
lol campbell looked like the mob was gonna get him 3:41
Bitcoin is going so high!!!!!
Luke blew it. Ryan was not right when he got up. Watch how he throws 3 wild swings, while trying to defend. He recovered well, granted, but Luke let him off the hook. Ryan not only has speed and quickness, there is Thunder in his punch !!!
I literally thought Luke Campbell was like a kid thats 23 & he's in his 30s 👀 lol he looking young tho
Nice face got knock down no wonder oscar is not to happy with you.
Ryan💪💪
First time I’ve seen Ryan get knocked down
Body shot KO's are truly spectacular
Dude this young man is so fast so so so fast
dang that body shot was look like canelos body shot
I started working out on the Cobra bag like Garcia .... three weeks into it and my speed, accuracy and power have rocketed.
Lucky kid. Hope you have learned to be humble and not show off.
Respect to Campbell tho
Ryan Garcia vs Luke’s liver
Bet ya won't sub to me for no reason
I’m southpaw
Why are you wearing underwear
3:18 imagine if that would have connected
weird seeing campbell not following up that knockdown.
He’s not ready
He fell faster than Nate Robinson
I feel like he threw the fight ...
Ryan es la maldita bestia y esto lo demuestra este es el próximo Canelo 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻 vamos a ver si Tank y los otros pencos estos aguantan y se paran como este nene ya probo la lona y se levantó como todo un guerrero 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻 my favorite one
That shot to the body was on super saiyan 5 level. Ryan hit him with a lot of power. You can see the pain in his eyes. He put up a great fight.
García 🖕💩
I was watching this fight liked what I seen from Garcia but man come on bro u need to learn how to move your head n feet.
Who cares if he is pretty... Please stop saying that DAZN announcers. In fact, talk less in general.
Pinche chamaco mamon ten respeto por Campbell hasta eddy te regaño si sigues así nadie te apoyará se humilde
He’s ducking Gervonte Davis
Hey whoever is reading this; have a great day and remember that Jesus loves you because he died for your sins, and rose again. It does not matter who you are, he loves you. Have a nice day!
🔥🌊🔥🌊🔥🌊🔥🌊🔥🌊🔥🌊
Now This is the first figth I saw garcia against an another real boxer before this one always potatoe sacks 😆😆
I felt that punch wow
7:13 knockout
is anyone wondering why campbell looks purple?
Style, flashy, a showman....add heart to that list💯
Every fight Ryan has, he proves what he can do and what a potential he has.
he got that "Rocky" Moment
I’m glad young Mexican fighters are taking the “give me anyone whoever is next “ mentality that’s why we will always be vital to the sport whenever it gets watered down best believe a Latino is coming from the ground up from the ranks the right way no promoting just skill and hard work
He would beat 98 percent of the comment section in a ring ☠️
He knock u out Ryan u done
what you came for 7:38
Major come back
Ryan García eres una vrg, eres  de las  personas que jamás se da por vencido 🔥💪💪
Ain’t ready for TANK !!!
I really want Campbell to get his shine man. He has the skills to be a top dawg at lightweight. I think Lopez Sr. was partly right when he said Campbell's problem is his mindset (even tho I can't stand the dude).  Do you guys think this was his last shot?
Ryan Garcia Knock down Thats expire
He callout thank davis .tank islas a difernt boxer islas better formar thai kid noticias face him
Legend in the making
What’s a south paw?
The fight was fixed 🙌
Fight tank you won't stand a chance
The nine tail fox 🦊 inside Garcia finally woke up .
Solid performance for Garcia! Has a lot of flaws still that Campbell exposed. Definitely needs to work on his defense and loosen up his footwork because he was fighting too stiff. Next fight is Devon Haney because he’s his mandatory.
Campbell took a dive. Change my mind.
Mans got a hook like sharkeisha....
That was a real MF fight mang
Garcia impressed me.. picked himself up off the canvas and finished it with a liver shot
Gracia aint for Gervante, Gervante aint gonna let him off the hook
7:35 if you came to enjoy the match and thats the first thing you saw lol
Was that Ramsay?
Ryan on his way to being a boxing conor
RYAN SHOWED THAT HE CAN BE BEAT
Garcia not ready for tank AT ALL
RYAN GOT ROCKED
I hope they don’t put him in with tank Davis he isn’t ready for that clearly he isn’t ready
It's funny how he knew he got one
it hurt me to see ryan go down I follow boxing less than Mma but Ryan really is a cool dude I root for him seems worthy haha
Now 💯 real that Gervonta Davis wants nothing to do this Garcia!!! And Gayweather will be sure to keep it that way.
no viral comment huh
Ryan has earned my respect will now be rooting for him yung king legoo
Lucky punch but still have a crystal chin.
Ryan definitely not ready for tank chill bro u gone hurt messing around with tank
Ryan Garcia got up from that nasty left hook like “snap back to reality Oop there goes gravity”
Ryan has speed and power but skills and footwork is out
“Don’t lie who else is a FAN”  “¡ᴍ ɢɪ🄵T̶ɪɴɢ ᴇᴠᴇʀʏöꪀᴇ ᴡʜo ꒒ɪᴋᴇꇙ ᴀɴᴅ sᴜʙs tᴏ ᴍe🐴”
Glass chin, huge eye opener for the fight. Hooks, hooks and hooks.
The kid got heart 👏
Sub to Verdant Bee
A come back like that gives the fans and the skeptics more reasons to believe in Bryan. Well on his way to becoming a tough champion.
I wanna see Canelo vs Tank
That body shot was NICE, fake going to head then liver shot. He is learning from the best.
Ese Ryan ganó pero la verdad no está listo pa los grandes lo nokean de una como a santa crus seguro
Luke's Left Lent a Lesson!  Round three, where's round three.
And he wanna fight tank who lol man plz
Right on Garcia! Didn't give up.
Respect ryian Garcia
Ye
REPENT YE: FOR THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS AT HAND .............................................................JESUS CHRIST OF NAZARETH IS LORD
Flat footed, head movement. Those 2 is enough to get him nailed to the canvas by Davis. If he works on those 2 he’ll be a beast and I’ll be a fan
Sincerily he is not ready for teofilo López or geovantis Davis
Lol Ryan get dropped is going to over shadow his win
crazy how I was just watching a fighter talk about this fight and he said he didn't think Campbell could handle Ryan's left hook. Figures that exactly the punch that won him the fight
Took a big hit but immediately got up and responded well by knocking Campbell off balance and then taking him down with that body shot. Huge win.
Proverbs 28:28 When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase.
Man Ryan is in trouble if he fights a heavy hitter. His defense looks like college football defense
Hope he gets knocked next fight
Ryan is massive for lw
Ryan gonna end up leaving Golden boy and join Canelo
No chance against tank
Who else thinks this was rigged after he got dropped?
Never Skip Leg Day! SHESH!
Campbell couldnt finish, he should of gone off on ryan after that knockout. Instead he let him recoup.
When tank (whom is a southpaw as well) gets that opportunity Ryan ain't getting up. But who knows Garcia might keep suprising us.
Does those punches affect the liver long term
who else dint know that luke was 33
The bigger they are the harder they fall right
Garcia needs to improve the better fighters are watching these highlights adapt Garcia and you will be the next canelo
👍
Ryan's trainer had him in a buck lock after the fight 😂
Garcia is all offense, Davis has offense and defense, and Haney will easily outbox Garcia.
Tank gon get em
I never had Ryan loosing this fight I actually was surprised it wasn’t light work
Well now everyone’s a boxing coach 🤦‍♂️
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates ♦️

But homie got knocked tf down tho
Why didn't Campbell keep attacking after down??????🤔
NOT HERE FOR THE VIDEO 😂😭 here only to laugh at the comment section judges 💀💀💀☕️
where are the naysayers today ... a gritty performance against a tricky and skilled southpaw
Some ones weakness got exposed to world to see 🤣 those bad habits are hard to fix . Stay humble warriors.
DAZN is making a smart business choice by releasing highlights right away.  People will always still pay to see it live, and by releasing highlights, they build up hype and momentum for future fights.
The ancestors of the Mexicans (the 80% of them)are the Spaniards and they discovered this continent and called America, people with courage, determination and BALLSSSS!
Ya ryan dropping his arm giving up the guard made all the difference with that hit
1. Getting up after that knock.  2. Delivering a nasty liver shot. 3. LETS GO CHAMP!!!
Hes peeing blood right now
Love how he looked and swung for the head with that hook. That’s why his body was left wide open.
Nobody:      That body shot: ⚡️
I like Ryan over Gervonta, but Gervonta gone win cuz his head defense is trash.
Tank hit dude he’s not getting up
That's right 🔥 👌
Great fight. Learned to cover his face when he got hit with the hook. Adaptive gamelan. No weakness. Respect
Boxing is back. Sorry Dana White
Glass chin Garcia
Well Ryan is the real deal. He went seven rounds he even got knocked down and still finished with the knocked out.
Garcia has a chin . a solid one tho !
the camera setups were amazing event.
Ryan can fight, but he can’t box. Anyone Who truly knows this sport can see that. That’s why he’s trying to stay away from Devin. He even admitted it himself.
you guys should do one night:ryan garcia vs luke campbell
So now you know why they had Lopez beat Loma. Ryan can now get a belt beating Lopez. Boxing is fixed and it’s a corrupt business. Only way to bring back boxing.
Ryan Garcia got too confident or cocky and got knocked out. This kid is not fighting the elites yet. He better be prepared and ready for that. Most importantly, he has to give the opponent the respect it deserves otherwise he will get big surprises again and again like in this fight. He has to be humble if he wants to go further in this business of boxing.
Nice representing the Garcia’s 😈
Bro what a champ. I wouldn't say I'm the most avid boxing fan but I've definitely never seen someone get knocked out with a body shot! 💉
A este morro le falta mas humildad la verdad ojala y Gervonta Davis le de la pelea para mirar la putisa ke le van a dar a Ryan Garcia!!!👍🥊🥊🥊
Great fight
Who else wants to see Erroll Spence move up and fight Canelo ?
Davis or haney is gonna be his 1st L
Not a lot of head movement in this fight
This fight was 10 × better than Lopez vs Loma. 👍🏼
Ryan has a terrible defense
J
love seeing how they got a bit of a crowd going on here. changes the atmosphere of the fight so much and gives the event energy
Don’t run walk first your time will come
*Great Way to keep fighting Ryan! He just seems like he always open for a hook.... If Tank lands that his jaw gonna be in section A62* and that’s the nose bleed section😂
Se graduó el chamaco, ahora a darle seguido. Éxito.
if Ryan takes a shot like that from Tank ain't no getting up
We need to see Garcia vs Mayweather if it’s possible
Everybody here still thinking, boxing is a real sport.  Idiots,  its funny how everyone now are coaches.
Was that canelo at the end?
Ryans low key goated😭he got up from that knockdown like nothing hit him and murdered him with a Body Shot
No lo dejaron levantar.. no conto los diez.. cua do se paro quito la pelea..
Ryan wasn't that impressive verse a decent fighter.. Time will tell.
Ryan gave Campbell that Canelo body shot!
With all respect I wanna fight Ryan😼
"I'm Ryan garcia and this is the body shot challenge with like campbell".
Better footwork and his going places with that left hook
You train with canelo, that’s bound to rub off in you ...
Davis vs. Garcia will be a quick match. Davis will handle this guy easily...
GOAT in the making for sure.
Imagine if that was gervonta Davis that landed the hook😬
Who is this pair of boxers..?🤔🤭😆
Luke looked like sorry Bro that was an accident I know I wasn't supposed to hit You for real My bad 😬
Keep it up Ryan u on a roll Mexican power baby
Wow. True testament to his resilience. Ryan, you did well. Just keep learning from the best and you will be even better.
These matches are so fixed
Bruh that’s the first time seeing Ryan get knocked down and everyone talking 😭😭😭
ryan garcia is going to get absolutely knocked tf out one of these fights. way too open and cocky.
That crippled the man
He’s a great fighter when he smells blood he coming for you but he’s too open while he’s throwing combinations somebody like tank or devin Haney throws too many punches. Ryan has to make better choices
Me importa una mierda lo que hizo Ryan García, no lo noqueó cuando termina enfrentándose cara a cara con Javonte Davis, oh, ahí es cuando Javonte estaba a punto de golpearle el trasero y lo derribaron una vez.
All that training, but there is still one thing they can't train you for.  Well at least he survived it.
I guess it’s safe to say, Campbell didn’t pass the body shot challenge
Cool fight !
The best highlights are always the ones made with a yellow Highlighter.
l
that mexican chin is different !
He’s definitely not ready for Lopez & Tank will eat him up like a dog but I respect this win he has heart
He ain't beating tank haney Russell or teo,period
Tank gonna walk thru him on the inside
If Davis hits Ryan like that, its gonna be a nyt nyt! Ryan has no chin!
Ryan leaves him self open every time he attacks that’s why he’s so easy to counter
So basically what you’re saying is this kid only has 10 more fights in him before he hast to retire.
wont get up if tank hits him with that same left!!!!
Khan chin
7:11 insta karma moment  Cambell :I take a shot at ur side  Ryan:i break side
The same social media body shot challenge.....Luke didn't pass
No defense, needs to learn more from Canelo.
I want to see loma vs Garcia. I have the money on Garcia
Well done👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Not a single bit of credit to Campbell in this comment section 🤦🏽‍♂️
Ryan has 0 chance against tank and everyone that thinks he does,  are delusional.   Tank is rite about ryan is not ready yet
The other guy deserved to win more age though
Screenshot 7:40-7:41. Ouch
ryan definitely don’t want any smoke with any of the elite lightweights, devin, lopez, davis, and loma
CAMPPEL ESTA BIEN PENDEJO!!!🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦,  CUANDO TUMBO A GARCIA LO TENIA QUE TERMINAR EN ESE RAUND!!,  Y NO DARLE OPORTUNIDAD A QUE SE RECUPERE!!!🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦
We know now that he can take a hit to the chin, and we know that Garcia can hit hard! He keeps winning by KO
Ryan GARCIAs BAE 😍
These type of fights make me wonder what Salvador Sanchez would do
They both landed their setup punches perfectly. Makes me wonder if body shots are more effective than blows to the head.
2:38 is when Ryan goes down😔
If Tank lands that punch Ryan is going to sleep
To anyone saying Luke is “old” or “washed” he’s only 33. If you’re a serious decorated boxer and always seeking to improve you can still be in your prime up to your 40’s. Look at mayweather, perfect example of age not having to stop you.
So does Logan Paul still want to fight Ryan ?
I cant believe i saw ryan hit the canvas tho
yktfv Ryan gon take out all these lil boys at 135
Garcia cant fight tank or Haney in this way he will lose
That body shots dangerous
campbell shouldve gone all out after that knock down
Watching this live I didnt even know what he hit him with when he knocked him down, that liver shot was so clean and fast that it looked like he just bent over and gave up
I never noticed until tonight how flat footed Ryan is and not only that dude puts a lot of weight on his heels...he has zero lateral movement and all that being said I don’t care what anybody says Tank will slump him unless he makes some drastic changes!!
He almost fights like I do!
That body shot was right on the button. Only person that would’ve gotten up from that body shot is Arturo Gatti. Lol
Ryan Garcia dug deep for that win! What a body shot! That was a test and he passed it!  Haney vs Ryan next!
Garcia u aint ready for Davis he won't let u get up he would put u to sleep like leo
I say Ryan should fight rollie or Santa Cruz next to lock in his shot against gervonta
7:12 Man, i felt that. Even i went exhaled saying:"Oooooooof". What a vicious left hook to the body. Awesome.
LIVER SHOT😓😓😓
If that was Tank or Teofimo rocking Ryan like that would he have gotten up???
He southpawed the southpaw
nevee seen garcia get knocked down like that but great way to comeback lets goo
Y eso q no entreno.
That was the best fight I've seen in a while I love this kid man
Ryan Garcia seriously a joke one of the easiest fighters bro this foo with one punch loses confidence if cam ball was not as tired and smarter it was an easy win for him
Ryan Garcia is the TRUTH, love that kid
That liver shot was all it took? Lol
I'm think I losing the figth
Not as many haters in the comments now
Man I missed fans at fights
What happened to no standing 8 count?
Campbell got the chicken legs
Dude can take a punch! Sensational performance after he was knockdown early. 👏
He has the Delahoya left hook.  Very hard  and fast effective to the head or body.  Needs to be more responsible defensively.
Kids money🤠
Ojala se enfrente a teofimo para que le bajen los sumitos a ryan ahora si lo enfrentaron a uno que tira golpes y lo conecto bien se miro la falta de defensa al soltar las manos ryan
Trash Garcia 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This was an amazing fight I think by Ryan staying a bit flat footed was to reserve his energy cuz moving around gets tiring idk luke is a great fighter as well so I saw this fight as like a crazy one it was amazing in all two great fighters
ok when Garcia got knocked down it didn't look that bad....until you see it in slow mo at 3:29 his face really said:  👁             👁       👃   🦷 👄 🦷
That kid is to cocky. He will get destroyed by Tank or Teofimo just watch.
Dreamed the night before that Ryan would get knocked down. No lie. :D
Garcia had his wake up call when he was knocked down for the first time.ive nothing but respect 👏for Garcia I wd luv to see Garcia vs Stevenson that wd be the fight of the year
Ryan the next mayweather
Ryan beat like Campbell 🙄🤷🏾‍♂️. And luke Campbell drops Ryan 😱. And Ryan wants to fight who next 🤦🏾‍♂️
Fixed fight
Ryan looked weak
My step dad was LIKE “NOOOO” and I was like “YASSSSSSS” GO RYAN    Also thank u for all the likes and still let’s hope for Ryan Garcia:3
Ryan is a great fighter but he stands too high and keeps his chin straight up if he doesn’t fix this mistake and start giving new looks he’s going to get knocked out in the near future Especially against a fighter like tank he need to fix that in a hurry!! but I wish nothing but success for the kid.
The constant KING branding is a little pushy..
Let’s gooo and gervante Davis would eat Ryan
DAZN always with the best highlights. 👌
Those body shots take a lot out of you. Garcia knows how to use body shots unlike many other young fighter.
As a bystander I think whoever signaled Ryan to keep his hands up in the 6th round is bad advice since he was going ham a few seconds before that. He could’ve put him down easy.
Everytime Ryan gets hit he gets angrier
Garcia is overated.
Ryan will destroy loma
Everyone keeps trashing Garcia this dude is the next legend right here nice win Garcia
He is not ready for any big names. Tank Davis, Teofimo will destroy him.
Tank is going to knock this kid out cold. He needs more fights before he challenge Tank.
I want to know who will win canelo training Garcia or mayweather training Davis
With all the left hooks Ryan was throwing to the head, Campbell thought it was coming upstairs. Ryan still fights a bit erratic and Eddy was telling him to chill out, yet he comes out and leaves himself open too much. With that being said, Ryan doesn't beat Davis. At least not yet.
Let’s Go Ryan!
Campbell = trash
👑Ryan thought Luke was gonna hit his stomach that's why he put his arm to parry but took a hit upstairs
Love or Hate Ryan, yall gotta admit he's bringing in the younger audience to watch Boxing. Yall gottta respect that.
If you watch carefully Campbell was having trouble breathing properly due to the coronavirus not to mention the weeks he had to take off because of it I couldn’t imagine how the fight would’ve went if he was 100% but congrats to Ryan
Boi that body shot looked nasty af. Congrats to gracia, beautifully done.
That knock down gonna mean more than his W
De pura gueba gano ya le andaba con los putazos
Nice body shot, I still say grow
Not gonna lie Garcia looks too stiff on his stance, gervonta will clean this lil boy
Ryan garcia need to go back to the drawing board still
This was whack. Minus the records, I didn't see anything spectacular
DAZN is the KING of Highlights!!! 💪🏻🤴🏻🤴🏻🤴🏻🤴🏻🤴🏻🤴🏻🤴🏻🤴🏻🤴🏻🤴🏻👍🏻
I think King Ry is still too young Haney& Tank would hurt this kid he still needs growth, the talent is there but rushing to be the best right now has him on the outside of the box, out of those other fighters all around no disrespect
Young bull got humble with that knock down but he showed he is a young lion heart by coming back and winning the fight.....🇺🇸🇺🇸🏆🎖🥊🥊1 luv.....
Familia!!!
I'm sorry but Bernard Hopkins body shot k.o against De la hoya is very suspect. I cringed each time people bring it up whenever a fighter wins by a k o body shot. Ryan's body shot was very vicious and ferocious and it's a joke to compare that to Bernard Hopkins suspicious k.o over Oscar De la Hoya.
Idk man before this fight I thought a García vs Tank would be close,  but after seeing ryan knocked down like that idk if he has the chin to survive
7:39 Garcia threw that shot with all his heart 🇲🇽🔥
Ryan showed heart and dedication respect 🙏
No one cares about boxing anymore. These guys look like any kid you can find hanging out at a gas station
Hopefully we’re not looking at Amir Khan part2.
Remain humble Ryan don’t get to cocky 🙏🏾
Gets dropped for the first time in his whole career and all the sudden his chin is sus😂 Campbell been dropped way more times and they had the same number of fights
Standing up and reaching equals knock down
Ryan must of been frustrated, he trained for that overhand left and he messed up on the positioning of his right arm.
I think if Campbell put pressure after the knock down he could’ve got the win, Ryan started fighting scared but Luke let him get his confidence back
A lot of boxing experts here bet they don't even hit the gym 😂🙃🤦‍♂️
Should have been hitting those body shot from rd 1
Ryan reminds me of a young khan got the whole game down packed but that chin is just not in tune with him
Crazy body shot
The kid is 22y let him make mistakes and learn... live his life and enjoy it... so what if he wants to do things he find “fun” on the side... boxing its not a game and if he wants to get away from it during his “off” time let it be. His talent got him the win
I kno the Spanish community wants Garcia to be the next dela Hoya, but boi trash 🤷🏾‍♂️... he might develop into something later on but he’s not ready now, I think they’re rushing him
RG is the new Delahoya maybe even better.
He soft
Garcia has no chin actually
He’s gonna get knocked out if he doesn’t work on his defense when he goes against the right person
That’s what u call a fixed fight! Campbell never tried to KO him after knocking him down and never thru another hard punch, Garcia will be out cold against Lopez, Davis and Loma would make a complete fool out of this fraud!
Everybody is a boxing coach now
Not ready for pitbull Davis yet.
Davis is still to much for him
Too Much Power of Garcia, one punch proves Garcia The Best, 7 rounds that's All it took eh?
Honestly awesome fight they put in the work...
Ryan Garcia really needs to understand that he's not ready for bigger fish.. after this performance he needs to go train with canelo and dedicate himself to 100%... he looked sloppy and like an absolute amateur. Anyone could've countered.
great fight man wow
Maybe he’ll stop posting ig videos and actually train hard now
Impressive win.
He stung like a 🐝
He needs a lot of defense
The thing about Luke is that some of the boxers he has boxed actually punch back.
What’s up with Liver shots and the British being knocked out👀👀
6 full months of head movement with canelo twice a day b4 he fights any1 he mentioned after re watching this Ryan didn’t do as bad as I thought I feel as if tho he can hang if canelo really digs in deep to reach him head movement & foot work either that or I believe he will be Amir Khan 2.0
😭😭😭😭 sends the kid down
Ryan Garcia is overrated
🇲🇽🇺🇸 👊🏼🤘🏼 Vicious body shot! All the way from San Diego!!
I never thought my boy Ryan would get knocked down
Homeboi is 10 years older than him. Just remember that
Ryan could of lost this...he’s not ready for the big fight yet
Not surprising hes been body shotin tf outta every youtuber and insta personality😂😂😂 practice in disguise 😂🤙🏽
Ryan got too comfortable but this was a wake-up call that he needs to work on his defense and movement. Overall, this knockdown is only gonna make him stronger than if he hadn't gotten knocked down.
That knockdown will only make Garcia a better fighter, it will humble him more and have him work harder and smarter on his defense, and it will also give him confidence now that he knows what getting dropped and coming back to win feels like
This kid is something special.
Fixed fight... they gave it to garcia... boxing is a dead sport...
Nice to know people are allowed to go to boxing matches but not church
If Ryan keeps his competition high he should have a title shot coming soon if he wins them all.
that body shot was crazy fast
Kids a hot head tank will give him that first loss
He will be way better now if he learns from this fight
Prove what you can do ry show em our blood different viva mexico
I think Tank is too slow for him..I wanna see him against Loma.
who else thinks like me, "ok so mexican guy against british guy, i'll go with mexican guy"
Great fight for Ryan. He should mature after this one and still stay confident. Tank Davis vs King Ry is going to be 💰!
Rematch!!!!!!
Ryan is a warrior Cambpell is no joke..that hook though..so proud of Ryan.
If Ryan Garcia works on his defense and foot work plus work on his jab keep his chin tuck he’ll be unstoppable
Luke Campbell didn't take the body shot challenge that well 😂
Ryan has been training with the canelo camp? Where is the defense? His aggression will only take him so far. Hopefully that knock humbles him.
Garcia will be ko'd , just a matter of time.
Not ready for Davis or Haney!
If I was Luke, I would be so tight loosing to a punch to the liver 😂
He better get Canelo teach him to move that head and work on his defense.
Great fight!!!
Everyone proud of Ryan saying how he got got up and stuff but if he had lost everyone will be calling him soft 🤣
Pienso que a Ryan García le falta pulir la defensa como canelo lo ha echo los últimos años para mi que canelo tiene varios movimientos de defensa de mayweather de echo money comento que canelo abia estado estudiando sus videos a Ryan le falta eso la defensa y se miraba frustrado después de que lo tiraron es todo Ryan a entrenar más duro y a pulir lo que falta felicidades champ !!! Bien merecido !!:)
It's funny how everyone hate on this man for not even getting knocked out.😂😂
Looks fade and chins are made to be cracked.  Toodles pretty boy.
I hope Jake Paul will knock out Ryan Garcia
Ryan garcia is the real deal just like Canelo Alvarez .
I am surprised Ryan won bc have of the time he was “ training “ we was kissing a miner. 😳
That was a nasty hook on Ryan lol I didn't think he'd win by KO, thought it'd be by decision.
Tank is gonna be a hard matchup for him
bro I was SHOCKED ASF when Ryan touched that mat !!! my face said it all 🤦🏽‍♂️
Kinda scary seeing Ryan get dropped like that hopefully he learns from his mistakes props to both fighters
jj
Tank first round knock out
Poor defense. Needs much much work for sure.
7:35 What's going on there?
David is going to destroy him
If Campbell would have won. His victory music would have been doo doo brown.
Proud of you Boi !!
How is his chin suspect?! That was a flush shot thrown from the hip... he didn’t go to sleep or wobble getting up. If anything it shows he has a decent chin and we should be suspect of his defense...
Este García es puro trigo inflado
Has no chance against Davis
Tank Davis gone knock him out by the 4th round
He's the real hit from dbs...
Campbell gave him a bit more problems than I expected him to but full credit to Ryan for getting back on his feet quickly and getting the job done against him.
even contest
He looked so surprised when he knocked him down
The Reynoso camp, style shining thru...El Rey Martinez..
Nice
Career is over.   Can’t be getting knocked down by chumps
Those ribs are outttt
That was definitely a canelo left hook. He fake looked up, but delivered low. Very nice
This Ryan kid flat footed I don't see footwork
I wonder if Malu was watching
Luke trash for dropping him with that big shot and not trying to finish him after. That was probably the most disgusting thing I’ve seen. Styles make fights but all I’m saying is if Ryan gets touch like that by Teo, Loma, Haney, & definitely Tank . You think if it’s 1 min & 30 seconds left in the round they ain’t gone Press for the KO?  😂 yea ok
He definitely needs canelos help with his defense. Love Ryan and give him props for fighting back. But that knock down was nasty
Now we no Garcia has a week Chin he can be knocked out so watch out garcoa
Congrats To Campbell, He’s the first to knock down Garcia. Let this be a taste to garcia in the division he has entered.
How has no one talked bout Campbell’s legs
Garcia drops hand after each punch... dangerous
Garcia gotta watch out or he gonna get handed his first lost
That ryan knockdown kinda reminded me of segura lol. Following proto
2:39 here’s a replay button for you all
Garcia just powers up like mario without the mushrooms🍄
No head movement
How does a body shot cause someone to crumble like that? Never seen it happen before.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 He's food for Tank. Easy work!!! GTD TMT TBE 💪🏽💪🏽👊🏾
I would love for Garcia to beat Davis for the shake of the raza but after this performance Davis would over power him and just walk him down
🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
That boy got a brutal boxing game
Fans will hate regardless I’m it a fan of Ryan but he showed grit got dropped not surprised by that but he won via ko when loma and Linares couldn’t ko campbell. Imo Campbell gave him too much respect this fight hence why he lost. If he took lead foot dominance and cut off the angle for Ryan pressured him felt he would have done better and ultimately won. Respect to Ryan Garcia he showed he’s decent at this stage in his career. Can’t hang with tank or Lopez atm tho. I box myself and head movement is very important moving your feet too he’s flat footed but those are things he can easily work on he’s at the pro stage for a reason.
Set up
He’s not ready for Davis yet though.
The no look liver shot
Obviously  a fixed fight 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♂️
That's Boxing... Battle with a Perfect Bodyshot Finish 💯
Ryan needed that knockdown... That'll make him a much better fighter in the long run
This fight for sure humbled Ryan so by the time he gets to fight tank he’s gonna be Ready
Legend in the making 🇮🇹
I just want to make sure this fight should just prove that Teófimo is better
them liver shots will knock the wind right outta you real quick
A legend is born
He ainn ready for tank
I think he dis great but he have to be more careful because he is to confident and opens up to much🇵🇷🙏🏼
Whatt a fight. Amazing from both boxers
Campbell should have went in harder after the knock out.Should have went in with evil intent.He would have won. Garcia is not ready right now for Tank..Tank fights with evil intent and he's hungry.....
Luke Campbell got more potential than Ryan Garcia. With the right coaching and a well put together plan, Luke Campbell would've dominated Ryan Garcia. He's just fast with his hands.
😎🤸‍♀️🔥
He wants noooo part of Tank
everyone a fan now🤔
2:38 Beautiful
This reminded me of Monster Inoue's vicious body shots.
Despite the knockdown Ryan was definitely the aggressor in this fight. Even if he didn’t end it with a body shot I think he still would have gotten a decision had it went the distance.
This was a free money fight. .
He is not 4eady for Linares
Are these fights fixed? Campbell didnt look like he wanted to finish the fight after he knocked garcia down
Tank and bell or nah
Y’all keep calling this kid a warrior for gettin up after getting knocked down like he’s the first person to ever get up after a knockdown😂
So when is García gonna fight Jake Paul?
goodfight for both fighter... that punch was garcia signature punch i believe congrats garcia
Campbell is the definition of don’t judge a book by its cover
He broke that boys ribs for sure
He’s not ready for tank. Who’s pound for pound heavy hitter. He wouldn’t of gotten up if it was tank.
He needs to work more on defense head movement keeping those hands up
Ryan got humbled real quick when he got knocked down. Plus he took the W.
Was that the canelo hook ??  🇲🇽 Power  Garcia / Canelo / Ruiz
Garcia is the best lightweight rn imo, hyped for his future
If that was Tank Davis. Ryans career would have been over with that left hook. Lol
Way to go Ryan!
There is that Mexican inside of him graduated with flying colors Ryan a true Mexican warrior much respect and will have MEXICOS RESPECT
He doesn’t stand a chance against Tank.   Not with a chin like that.   I’m getting Leo Santa Cruz vibes if he and Tank clash .
Lol. More than ever now I can tell he is a weak fighter and more than likely paid to win that fight. Look at that dudes face when he knocked Garcia down. Like man I messed up now I won’t get paid. 😂😂 joke.
Campbell should have stayed on him after the knockdown, instead he sat back and let him recover.
Sketchy fighting Campbell drops Ryan garcia and after that he started fighting like he’ got dropped and scared of Ryan it almost seems like he wasn’t supposed to drop Ryan and held back after that it’s crazy lol
who else was in shoke that ryan got knocked down
This kid is gonna be trouble for Gervante can't wait to see that fight
not impressed
Campbell didn't attack after the knockdown, Garcia would not pass that second round if he was fighting an elite boxer like him, sorry kid, not yet, ways to go, he's only 22, he needs to be very careful who he calls out for his next fight.
Luke did a body shot  challenge with Ryan
The knock down in the 2nd added more glory to the tko in the 7th.
Clean liver punch ended that fight! Wow!
I'll be happy when this kid actually fight someone!!💯
We love you in Southwest side of Chicago! Maybe you can visit us some day and encourage the kids. Our prayers are with you.
It's obvious that Ryan is more like De La Hoya style and instinct wise, but he tries too hard to fight like Canelo.
The ten year sadly please because seed enzymatically bless under a sassy trumpet. quixotic, abaft wasp
For that being his first knockdown he took that well
A little advice to Garcia, learn something more than just that knockout hook you got. Now that your rounds lasted more than 1, you can see your flaws. No doubt you CAN be one of the greats. But you gotta be more humble!
Im sorry but Ryan is not ready for davis he still baby but if he wants to give the title to Davis go ahead but you can't make yet baby
Ryan your trash.
That body shot looked like nothing in normal time but when they showed it in slow motion you can just tell it how much it would hurt
#1 on trending
Looking for expert advise from these comments.
Ryan doesn’t have that baby face anymore
Tank davis has flying upper cuts! If Ryan gets that fight he's gotta ready himself big time! He's way too open.
Better work on that footwork cause somebody gonna knock him out completely like that.
The next superstar in boxing!
This the dude that wants tank? 😂
Garcia lucky he hasn't been seriously hurt in a fight . His footwork and head movement or shockingly bad . Garcia also head hunts way to much . Like dude was jumping forward .
Amazing fight. Glad we got to see Ryan face someone who puts up a battle.
I would never let a Mexican boy beat me.
Davis better let him fight some more cause if they fought now it’s a clean knockout 😑😂
That body shot learned from Canelo!!
Vicious body shot from Garcia...future champ most defenatly 🥊🇲🇽
Garcia is food for stevens, tank, and haney and if you can't see it your choosing not to his foot work was terrible,  that head never moves and his combinations are predictable
Ryan is the 🐐 of lightweight
Campbell is afraid...If you’re afraid against any Mexican fighter, you’re done.
He's definitely not ready for Tank...
I was prepared to see Ryan lose after reading these comments
Fixed fight 🤦🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
Ryan has natural gifts which have allowed him to get away with leaving his chin high, dropping his hands after throwing certain shots, and not moving his head.  He hasn't been in the ring with someone who could match those natural abilities or nullify them. The only fighters who may be able to fully take advantage of those are the very best fighters in his division. In any case, i do see Ryan showing some progress in his combination punching.
It just amazes me. Almost 6 foot and weighing 135lbs and looking in top tier shape. I see a mayweather match soon
When Ryan got knockout my jaw dropped
Wait until devin  Haney teaches him a lesson
Liver shot hurts
Why is an up and coming young boxer fighting a 33 year old, how is this even a challenge for him 💀💀💀
RG used his youth to his advantage in this fight, can't be mad at that. He isn't beating Tank, but he looked great in this fight.
The kid is 22... he won’t reach his prime for another 6-8 years... think about that... Beat an Olympic Gold Medalist and World Title contender. This could have been a fight that could have exposed him but he did the opposite and silenced many doubters except for the Tank fanboys. I say let him keep fighting fighters like Campbell and Jorge Linares and work on foot movement/defense. Most importantly getting experience fighting with the elite boxers. Avoid Tank, Teo, and Loma.
El garcía será bueno pero no trabaja el cuerpo del oponente
badass!
Didn’t really like this guy, but man coming back from getting dropped early round... what a fighter.
2:39
Ryan Garcia Mr Glass for Tank.
7:38
Garcia is way too flat-footed. Davis or Lopez would have a field day with him
Campbell : "Ah... ah... ah my rib my rib"
Time to start tightening up that D garcia. Tank is a different animal
HE CAN'T BEAT TEOFIMO LOPEZ
Mouth open?? Eat a snickers your tiered...sprinkle left hooks like Chavez and all issachar warrior's!!..NO MAMES WEY!!
Rían Garcia against white chocolate!!!!!
Al tank no legana con nada
Garcia has very weak defense
Garcia got rocked with that ◀️
Is Ryan ready gervonte ?
Left hook nasty 🤮
Keep improving Garcia’s record by not giving him a real fights.
Voy al alacran Belcher's
Garcia will lose to tank
Garcia always gets weak opponents. Give him a real fight with a black fighter.
I’ve really been waiting for Garcia to get knocked down, I wanted to see how he handles it, and I can see he’s going to be one of the greats!! A new golden boy in the making
Signature Canelo body shot - beautiful match and heart by Garcia
Ryan reminds me of amir khan once he steps up to known boxers hes going to get expose
Todo mi dinero con el alacran asi nomas
Gained loads of respect for Ryan Bc of him fighting through that, this kids the real deal he just needs to humble himself a bit and he’ll be capable of big things
His chin is questionableeee. imagine that left was tank? I don’t think he’s ready for any big fight, In his first he got dropped, now let’s think, if that was teofimo, or tank? Hmmm I see alota improvements he made, and he still needs to make better ones. His career will be interesting
I wanted to see Garcia take punches an see how he reacts an can he overcome adversity yes he can great fight we got to see a lot more out of him chin got tested an ability to overcome adversity an make adjustments on the fly
Proven fact, Garcia has no chin... Hahaha.
Nice 👍🏻 how fast he got up like a champ , Reynosos fam younin goof hands boy 💪🏼
He's not going to beat Tank sorry
That guys nuts probably retracted into his stomach after that body shot 💀
At 2:38... Ryan Garcia does his best Amir Khan impression 🤣🤣🤣
Hope this kid Garcia gets knocked out 🤣
He said oh you wanna hit me with a body shot. Hit him and that was the end of the fight
Real fight!!!
That liver shot made my stomach hurt
Tank will destroy Ryan Garcia
Bueno ya le tocó un boxeador que lo tiro a la lona.  De aquí en adelante va a ser más complicado y se vera realmente si se convierte en leyenda
Great Body shot!!! But Ryan has too many Flaws to beat the Best at this division, he needs a lot of work.. He better stay away from Lopez, Tank, Haney, Lomo & Stevenson
he needs a jab
That’s a few broken ribs there. ☹️
I'm glad the announcer brought up oscar de la hoya when talking about ryan garcia he reminds me so much of a young de la hoya.
Who had Campbell beaten at the pro level? I'll wait
De la hoya faked that ko against bhop and everyone knows that how do u guys dare to use that comparison with this fight , this was a real fight b hop and dela hoya was shadow boxing
TOO WEAK FOR TANK🧐
My boy Ryan don’t quit💯😎👊🏼
🙏🙏🙏💪💪💪🙏🙏🙏
Garcia got up and handled his business. With high level fighters you can't be having lapses. The knockdown will get that defense tightened up.
Luke would of won if he wasn't paid off to lose.
I like ryan a lot, but he is not ready for Tank; trust me.
At 22. Got dropped clean and came back to finish. If you didn't believe in this kid by now, you're in for a rude awakening for the  next couple of years. This is the mental strength and beliefe that separates Garcia from everyone else...Welcome to the History Books Ryan...This book is all yours..
Garcia i know you win but don’t you call Gervonta please
I like ryan but he not ready for davis
👍🏻💪🏼Nice
The bell literally saved Campbell from being knocked out at the end of round 5
Fight Devin Haney !
Ryan is unstoppable, I would absolutely die if he hit me where he hit Luke
That was average fight.. the dogs 🐕 on the other side of the street smelled blood..and they hit way harder then luke..just sayin
Garcia will be middle weight champ one day.
But will he be Gervonta (Tank) Davis can't wait to see tht fight
Ryan has some way to go to fight Lomachenko or Teófimo López.
Ryan the truth Garcia
Wanna see 2nd fight.
Luke should have knocked Ryan out
the punch look like it seriously hurt him and then he gets up 1 second later and he doesn’t look hurt at all
Welcome yo the World Ryan. You went knocked down.
If TANK hits him with that its over.
King Ryan looool Ryan is too soft  King Ryan looool
Glad for Garcia i am....but a finisher would have slept him in that round and maybe really hurt him. I hope he learns... That wasnt a flash. He was out for around 40 seconds and the only thing that kept him awake was that dead arm keeping him from slamming his head off the canvas. I know no real boxing fans can disagree. He got shut off by that punch.
Soft chin!! Amir khan in the making
Garcia needs to learn Canelo head movement, he eat every shot 😤
is the psh sound when ever they they punch a sound effect or the sound of the gloves
After last night fight I got Ryan behind teofimo , Haney and tank
I wonder if Tank would've got up if Lomachenko dropped him to come back and win by KO?? 🤔
Sheesh them ribs are BROKEN
He not ready for tank
If Campbell would of followed up with the right ryan would of never gotten  up from that.
Puro Mexican American the kid juat came in over confident and got caught but came in and won once he calm down what the excuses now comment haters
FEED HIM TO GERVONTA!!!!
Tank rubbing his hands like birdman after that knockdown 👀
Slow motion made that body shot look vicious 💪🏾🔥
The mature group logically coach because house oddly extend onto a healthy bean. purple, whole attic
They need to keep this kid away from David gervonta... David would eat him alive
I could beat them both in my sleep
That fight was a great lesson for Ryan. Hes ready for tank now
🇲🇽 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
The REAL REASON on why he got knocked out is cuzz he got a girlfriend and he be fcking alot 😂😂so the energy is gone
If Tank lands a shot like that, its over
Ryan plz don’t ever call out gervonta again I don’t want him going to jail
He didn’t go after him. What???
I dont think people truly understand the power and mechanics behind that body shot. Garcia is extremely gifted
He Hit Him In The Body First N Got Knocked Out 😂
1 million lost for mayweather....🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
7:44 ahh i felt that
Garcia was lucky!
His chin is glass. AMIR KHAN 2.0
"His liver was like a balloon " 🤣
He need to work on the jab and foot work .right now tank will be him easy ..
This fight is proof, Ryan Garcia needs another 2 to 3 more years of  Experience before he fights Gervonta Davis. 🍿🍺🥊
Ryan Garcia is not ready for the tank or Haney fight. I seen a fighter who just throws punches and hope something lands. He had that body shot several times. Very open. He constantly positioned himself on the inside of Luke’s lead foot. Setting himself up for a counter left. And the right hook that dropped him. He has to figure these things out within seconds not rounds. I hope that he has this problem fixed before going against somebody with some power like tank.
Le gano a un sparring 10 Años mayor que nose movia otro protector Canelo Delahoya 👎👎👎👎👎
canalo fr was clapping like a proud father
Luke got paid to stay down, Ryan didn't have it in him to stop Luke.
All these dudes commenting here, like they’ll last a round with one of these guys 🤣
Luke shouldve joined cobria kai
I think Tank stops Ryan Garcia. 😫
I don't think Garcia is ready for Tank Davis with that weak chin
He can't be that flat footed vs Tank or its night night 😴
Ryan definitely hit that sweet spot
Last minute of the second round you can tell ryan is worried and trying to keep cambell off him while regaining his composure;  ryan took a clean shots to the jaw and top of the head near the temple and got dazed for a half second. Interestingly enough looking back the the fight, Ryan lands the same body shot that take down campbell later in round 7. That shot looked like it got cambells attention in round 2 and then finally dropped him later on
Neither one of these guys would even be six rounders in professional boxing in the past.
Ryan’s overrated
He lucky he wasn't in there with a killer. He was still hurt and Campbell didn't press him
He got so lucky he made out this one
Ryan needs to fight Lomochenko
That liver shot was delayed it hit him a couple seconds later tho 😂.
Garcia is preparing his chin for "Tank" Gervonta Davis.👊 three times stronger than Campbell😰
Seeing Ryan go down was a different feeling. I was so shocked
Loma couldn’t take Luke down and the fact that Ryan knocked him down shows a lot
Ryan needed that humbling knockdown. Jake Paul is next that needs a humbling knockdown
From what Bryan showed in this fight, not even close to winning Gervonta Davis. He doesn’t have to tools against a south paw.
That’s right young king 👑 it’s your time ❤️🙏💚 bless up champ!!!!!
They love hating on Garcia. He’s very talented. Let’s see how his career pans out
Hit him in his liver like that.... Luke gon be pissn sunny D fa the next 2 weeks...
Luke didn't seem as shredded when he fought loma probably didn't take this fight that seriously
He is not ready for tank he is over is head. Campbell put him down with that imagin tank give it three more years garcia
When is he gonna fight someone
Needs a lot of work on defense he flat footed and head movement needs work his hands or down aswell
He's going to fight more fighters like this Garcia needs to grow up a lil and learn from this mistake he made but very proud to him get back up Shake it off and come back and win 🏆.
Garcias sólo tiene pegada cero boxeo cuando encuentre un contra golpeador ahí queda, le falta mucho que aprender
Rayan didn’t listen to eddy he was never supposed to be knocked out. He was supposed to go in a break him down but took it by his thought which cost him
Amazing fight. There were no boring rounds!! Both guys are true champions. Garcia is now on another level!!
Siempre lo dije este hombre es de otro planeta  No tiene rival y será el mejor de todos los tiempos. Recuerden estas palabras.
Sorry,  i don't see any greatness in this Kid.  He's all hype and emotions not enough defense glass chin. When he face elite fighters he's gonna get knock out for real.
like the Anouncer  SAID    the SAME bodyshot  that t Knocked Oscar de LAJOYA down in the  Bernard hopkins vs OSCAR wow!! ididnt know  a bodyshot coul end the FIGHT  thanks for uploading this video!!
Una pelea , sin acción..
American kid knocks out British man...you people are soft.
Great fight
Set up the Gervonta Davis fight and let’s see the outcome
A Garcia la falta muchísimo por aprender, no lo veo para enfrentar a López ni mucho menos Davis..
Yessssssssssssssssassasssaaaaa
That’s what he gets for cheating on his wife 💀 😂 2:38
"He took that punch well" 😂🤣
Proud of Him ,the Kid did great ,took a lil knock down got up and won the round  That body shot was nasty 🥴
I like Garcia he just need to work on his defense and he’ll be a beast🤦🏽‍♂️
Immediately thought of Hopkins vs Oscar lol great fight from both guys
Great fight!!! Garcia is the real deal. Just learn to keep that chin tucked.  He’s got some holes in his defense but nothing gym time cant fix
Garcia has no chance against tank if he got knocked down by Campbell. Tank hits like a mack truck , he is not getting up, trust me
What this fight showed is that RG needs to work on that defense. Each fight seems like it teaches him something so we’ll see what happens
Lunging forward, locked elbow, perfect accuracy, and people are calling this a weak body shot? Anybody would fall to a liver shot like that. Poor southpaw.
Kids got hands!! 🤷‍♂️
Eddy Reynoso is THE MASTER! "Levante las manos mijo, no pasa nada, salga y partale su madre"
Come see the  monster 👹
Now I feel Tank won’t be as easy as Garcia thinks but he’s definitely a champion
Tank gonna knock his head off no hate but it’s just a bad match up for Ryan and his style of fighting
Tank throws more and he short plus fast . he go beat Ryan up bad . nobody in the game boxes better than tank with Floyd Joel Diaz and Mickey Garcia helped tank before. Even buddy mcguirt. Ryan is about to take his first L but he asked for it.
When Ryan garcia got knocked he was like I'm alive but I'm dead
Great fight for both fighters. Respect!
ryan might be the next amir khan
Two great fighters great 👍🏼 fight.
Ryan’s aggressive nature in the ring can get him in trouble with a more skilled boxer. Great win for the young man tho, he showed toughness after that knockdown.
Thanks for the body shot KO Flash!
This kid looks like the real deal. He has a lot to learn still, but that knockdown early in the fight will serve as a reminder to buckle down and be more serious in his training and more observant when facing his opponents in the ring. His game was impressive after the knockdown.
Tiene muy mala defensa todo lo que le tiran le entra cierra la boca Ryan 😁no está listo para la ver gota Davis 😅😂
Ryan exposed his weak chin. I knew he had one.
BRO THAT KNOCK DOWN IN THE FIRST WAS SOOOOOO PRETTY GREAT JOB CAMBELL!!!!
Ryan could have finished the fight earlier. The left hook was landing and was there the whole fight. Could've ended the fight in the 3rd or 4th
Lucky he landed that bodyshot or else Luke would’ve beat him
People really under estimating Ryan in my opinion. I thought he was hella overhyped and a tik tok boxer and he proved me wrong and shut me up. He controlled the fight and won every round after he got knockdown. He bounced back like a real champ would
wait till he meet the baltimore dog
as long as Garcia and Canelo keep fighting these overrated European fighters there will be no problems.
People in the crowd why 😆
Jijiji
Man I like garcia but he reminds me of pac man. Throws a bunch of unnecessary punches missing. Has to develope skills cause Them Tanks and Haneys will do him terribly bad.
If tank get Ryan Garcia hurt like that he will finish him
He's starting to fight like Canelo
If he can’t take that hook he’s definitely not takin gerovante’s hook💯
This Fight is a classic
Ryan is going to be a great boxer one day ! Haters sit back and enjoy the show!
That liver shot is a killer dude
And he thinks he's ready for Tank? 🤣🤣🤣
He not getting up from a lick from tank like that. And Haney out boxes him easy he is too flat footed. Amazing speed and power but just not polished enough for those guys.
One of the few times I wish it could of gone on for longer, a very entertaining fight.
Ryan Garcia resembled Tyson Fury in his ring walk for Deontay Wilder. Both Garcia and Fury finished their opponents by TKO in Round 7 as kings
Ive neverd seen nobody getting up like nothing happened after a vicious knocked down like this one😳thats having Mexican huevos!!!
he's gonna be scary  great heart
He’s not ready for tank
liver shot was lethal
Luke has no killer instinct.  Needs more output.  Ryan needs to move his head...
Meeeeeaaaan liver shot
Let’s get Ryan in the ring with Deji  Fight of the decade
Garcia like every other Garcia I’ve seen thus far is all HYPE😒
7:39
Campbell should go all at it in round 2
If that was Tank he would have been knocked tf out
At least DAZN 2021 has better Highlights now.
I thought Garcia was gonna lose the fight.
Ya te andava no que no visitabas la loma ray
Staged
El morro del ryan gano la pelea emocinalmente cuando campbell lo tumbo, levantarse despues de semejante putazo....de ahi se lo chingo emocinalmente al campbell.
Gervonte would had put garcia in ICU
Sergio mora calling him pretty all the time is just sus at this point
I’m glad he got knocked down, I hate when commentators sit up their n annoite n promote the fighter they feel should dominate because of superstar stature, nah this boxing stop acting like one punch can’t change y’all hand picked fighters life
That body shot looked painful
This kid not ready yet but he has potential. Right now he's Amir Khan to me.
It's always the ones who never been in a fight, let alone even a pillow fight, who think they know what it is to take a hit.
I tell you this he better not get hit from tank like that lol or it will be goodnight Irene
Ryan no tiene nada de defensa, se descubre mucho la cara y se avienta mucho, con un mal movimiento que aga como el que ISO lo puede arruinar.
He fell on purpose lol he looked great the entire fight just makes no sense
These dazn time frames are crazy i was fkin sleeping
Ryan stands to tall and always drops his hands Nd puts them forwards for some reason witch is why he got dropped .. when he fights a top fighter with real power he gonna get smoked spec in the higher weight classes
After the knockdown kid got up kept going, he’s a warrior
pacquiao vs garcia may 2021 las vegas, nevada
Idm Ryan went on the canvas
Lo que yo miro esque este muchacho le hace falta un mundo para yegar a ser un campeón completo pero bueno ya este deporte perdió la credibilidad  sólo habría que ver la reacción de Campbell cuando mandó a la lona y cuando lo atacaron sin coraje sin reacción el savia que sólo era un tramite y que el yego a la pelea por su plata cobró y después la fotito con garcía y canelo todo un chow bien montando
Showed heart and now we see the wholes he has in his game he needs to work on in the gym with Reynoso in fixing.Great talent now needs to be shaped into a top tire fighter
Soy mexicano y no megusta el boxeo d Ray Garcia solo tiene una pegada si no tepega seba con el golpe gano por surte parese k el ribal gano mas bendiendose k peleando con Garcia
The punch Garcia got his with even though it landed it wasn't all of the other fighters power because of the distance. It showed character to get up and close the way he did...keep working hard!
That body shot look devastating but I’m still surprised he didn’t get up.
That was really entertaining!!
You are officially Mexican. Congratulations Ryan.
Garcia vs Loma
Stop the hate Ryan going to be ok he’s young with plenty of talent he will grow calm down haters
Maneeee
Needs to be more fluent.also needs to  use what he has and take what is given first one tho not bad
This guy will not beat Tank
And he says he wants to fight "Tank"... He wouldn't have gotten up if that was "Tank"😀😀... Not a believer...... As of yet!!!
When that dude face a real fighter with power he want get up
Still you need to work on your defensive skills. Stay too open in my eyes. Work on that u gonna be alright.
I don’t get why Campbell held back after the knockdown.  He Let him recuperate
That body shot in slow motion omfg 🥴🥴
Cant wait for Tank to TKO this imitation.😑
he will be back better and more smarter he still young plenty to learn on his side. great fight
he wouldn’t of gotten up if tank hit him like that
People don’t understand how much a body shot hurts , and then you only get 10 seconds to try n get your breath back
I like Garcia but he can't beat Tank!
So much weight on lead leg just wanna kick it lol
Лома смотришь?
Ryan has a bad habit of leaning straight back to avoid punches...
This fight showed a lot about Ryan that was unknown before. He handled himself really well and didn't panic when he was hurt. Everybody's gonna get rocked at some point, just gonna happen when you have punches flying at you regularly. A lot of maturity was shown in this fight.
Just like I said he’ll get knocked out
Tank will decapitate this kid. No head movement, flat footed, needs some serious work on defense.
Just like Aamir Khan he’ll get knocked out Everybody got a weak point
Wow I doubt he be able to get back up from a hook from tank Davis he’s best bet is don’t let that shot touch him 😳
Commentators are bias....Garcia was hitting a lot of gloves. Stay away from Tank, Haney, and Teo. Them 3 will give him that serious work.
Fixed
Now he gotta fight devin
Ryan ain ready for the big dogs
You can tell that dude had zero air. He couldnt get a single ounce of air. Wow.
Getting knocked down was the best thing to happen in Ryan’s career! Now people can’t say that he’s just a “pretty boy” and can’t take shots. My guy not only took a shot, but got right back up and didn’t even blink!! THAT IS A FIGHTER 👑 Remember, he’s still very young so head and foot movement will come with more experience, but the kid is a BEAST. Respect.
Ryan needs to work on footwork everything below the waist looks awful
Let’s be honest, GREAT fight and great comeback after getting dropped, Garcia is a champ BUT if that was Tank Davis throwing the shot that dropped him Ryan would not have gotten up.
that first knockdown was a lesson. just cause you're usually the taller fighter doesn't mean you drop your hands.that right hand gotta be stapled to that cheek all 12 rounds. always bite down on your mouthguard. that open mouth stuff won't cut it against real punchers. Ryan head movements gotta improve. we seen he can get hurt, so now he's gotta work on not getting hit so easy with big shots. and finally, his footwork. too flatfooted. he's gotta be more bouncy and light-footed like a younger de le Hoya. he's gotta learn to punch in movement and not so much plant his feet to get leverage on his shots. if Ryan can perfect all these mistakes, then he will be a force to be reckoned with in the lightweight division.
El chingon
Fighting a journey man wow 👏
From live that body shot didn't look like it did that much damage but in slow mo that body shot did so much damage and it was wide open.
Everyone says oh he’s to flat footed bro... those are the best toe to toe fighters not like may weather a runner
All I know if that was tank that caught him like that Ryan wouldn’t got up
Ryan  need to  work harder on his movements , still young  he will get there  Eventually
He comes in to hot wen when there not hurt gotta take ya time young blood get caught with an nasty up by tank goin in like that then gloves might touch the mat
Ryan has never celebrated this much. He knew after that knock out his chance of winning went down.
Ryan only covers half his face and any guy with a really fast punch could knock him out with ease
🇲🇽 🇲🇽
I knew Luke Campbell wasn't getting up from that body shot. As soon as it made contact I thought "No way is he making the 10 count." Way to vicious, way to quick. Well done Garcia 👏👏👏
That’s Right!!!!!!!! Big up Ryan
Tank would ko Ryan if they fought right now. He better stay FAR FAR away.
García is not in the level yet
I’m impressed. He still need work. He is to busy planting those feet for his shots he doesn’t use them to evade shots coming in. He just hops back or to the sides and he got caught. Great job for his corner in calming him down after the knock down. They also got after him for exploding on him In the 6th I’ll give him just an A. Now for Floyd gonna say if he get hit by Tank like that he ain’t getting up or Tank will finish him. Well prove it get the fight...
I like Garcia, but he better keep his hands up all the time, cuz if he fights tank and he gets hit, he is not getting up
Can all you guy's tell me again what the stats mean   👂 y'all we're 👄 smack 2 day's ago.  But sure thing i bet y'all won't say 💩 Now!
Both have the mobility of a mountain
Not impressed!!
I like how he came back. But he lost a lot of confidence with that knockdown. I don’t see him getting past the elites with him losing confidence so fast.
Ryan only needs to improve his foot work. That's his only weak area. Right now he is too flat footed and stiff. Once he learns to dance around then he'll be even more deadly.
BIEN FUERTE EL PUTASO..CHIDO POR EL GARCIA....ARRIVA 🇲🇽.. CABROONESS..
I wanna see you in the ring with Manny Pacquiao.
Very impressive win!!!
I love Garcia but i dont know if his chin can handle to same left hook from Davis
All of those body shots challenges that he did payed off 😂 Kingry💪
Took a power punch on the chin and got back up?  Knocks the Olympic Gold medalist out with a body shot... Yall better stop hating on this kid! He's bringing boxing back to the masses for the next decade plus 👊
y’all really tried to say he want smoke with Tank...nah no way
Boxing like dis he will never beat Haney lol the fight gone go just like it did wen Dey fought in olympics
Great heart n his last name the best get humble N train. Hard knock them out
Fixed?
Did anyone else notice how skinny Luke's legs are 😭
Garcia is a little hyped right now. Too flat footed and no upper body or head movements on defense. I'd like to see him improve cause he isn't great.
He not ready, by a long shot. Not for the elites. This kid would go to bed in there. Looking like Bambi. 🪗
Campbell let him off the hook in that second.. he should have at least tried to finish Garcia... he just let him get back right
He ain’t ready for tank 🤣
And jake Paul wants to box him... L O LLLLLLLLLLLLL
Head movement and Footwork = Greatness ....
Happy new year wishing you success
Garcia will be another Chavez Jr
Ryan needs head movement because I didn't like the way he wasn't moving his head and hopefully that knockdown will get fixed before he fights again.
Campbell made a mistake not jumping on him after the knockdown. He let him relax, shouldve tested how rattled he was.
I think Luke got Ryan with a body shot prior to the one Ryan  gave him but he ate it like nothing..
Congrats Ryan.
This fight is trash. Its like watching 2 girls in middle school throw down.
Tank will hurt this boy. But he showed heart when he got up.
No defense looks stronger than  last fights but cannot fight big hitters like this at all overall  bad fight for garcia
That look like a fake left to the head love it
For some reason I see an Amir khan type of ko loss happening. Same type of fighters.
All Ryan had was 20 fights, got dropped by a flush shot, but got up to KO a world class fighter. It's inevitable a fighter is going to be nailed , what counts is what happens afterwards. Garcia is now world class , but hold off on the superstar status. For now.
Ryan aint skilled enough for Haney and Tank...he needs another year before those fights happen....work on your defense and learn to use the ring
Kid is hype. Wait till he gets his first loss and crumbles.
Saitama death 👊..
If tank hit him with that clean left hook he woulda got knocked out thats all ima say
Need a couple more b4 Davis.. Huge heart on this young man though 👍
seeing ryan getting knocked down just made my day thanks luke!
Haney ,Davis loma ,teofimo would smasshhhh Ryan Garcia lol
It’s weird having someone that old fight someone that young...
Garcia waayyyyyyy toooo flat even afta gettin dropped!!
🎲
Ryan garcia defense is weak like literally the kid has his fist on his chest
Tank might dislocate dat jaw NO CAP !!
So everybody inthis comment section a boxing coach now
He needs to just fight  Devin haney
He ain't ready fa Tank PERIOD ...PROVED TONIGHT!
Ryan would get knocked out by Tank! Ryan gotta practice more on his defence
Ryan Head up pulling straight back all night and what can he do when he has to fight off his back foot.he keep throwing that lazy jab he asking for a over hand right counter. He better ask Leo  what happen to him
Lucky punch.. Ryan Garcia won’t be champions.. glass chin
That’s right young boy us Americans should’ve never let these U.K Boys beat us
Ryan Garcia has no defense ZERO. He is there to get hit at will , I see this cat getting KO.
I thought Ryan could beat Tank after watching this fight I got Tank with the Knockout
Ryan garcia still needs alot of work in the ring before he fights the big names...Ryan's bad defense was exposed and he still makes to many mistakes. not ready for big  fights...Tank would have knocked him out  Easily
Ryan beefing up would be crazy 💪
So everybody is a professional trainer now.???☠️
Yo was that the first time Garcia got knocked?lol
Lopez vs Garcia 2021 🔥🔥
Either he was gonna lose and be humbled by it or he was gonna win and have a boost of confidence but he got both on this fight by getting knocked down whatta fight.
Tank will demolish Ryan. We saw it now, his defense is not fast, or strong  enough.
Stay away from tank Stay away from haney
When Davis(TANK) him'em he won't get back up
Ryan needs to work on defense 😒 🙄
What a great fight. Showed what Garcia is made of. Everybody wondered if Garcia could come back from adversity and he did!
Props to Garcia!...he did his job!
I predicted that Ryan would get knocked down but overall great fight and respect to all
Ryan has that baby chin. I’m seeing a Mexican version Amir Khan in Ryan Garcia. Great boxing skills and fast but the baby chin will get tested against better competition that doesn’t just stand right in front of you.
Ryan not ready for tank he won’t get up 🙅‍♂️
Not ready for top comp but I am finally a fan. Takes a certain kind of heart to stay calm and get back to work.
wow
Garcia’s defense is bad , and he needs to learn how to hide his chin.(closer to the chest )
Tank would destroy Garcia
Ryan Garcia chin is like a wet paper bag tank Davis would  Demolish him in 5 rounds 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
If it was tank hitting Garcia he would of never gotten up! The diva is not ready for tank!!
This kid has no business asking for a fight with Gervonta Davis. Not even in the same skill level. Davis would destroy this over confident average boxer.  Khan 2.0 bro
Meskins always putting in those mitts
I know tank Davis like😁😁😁😁 easy money 💯💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾
Nice
Don't like him staying flat footed. Needs more head movement. But that body shot was beautiful.
I can’t wait to read all the great technical expertise from keyboard boxing warriors
I wouldn't put him in there vs Lopez, Haney and especially not Tank
Gervante will knock this guy head off
Idk why exactly... I love this kid. His story, family, flaws. That’s what makes him so interesting. So young with room to grow and mature as a boxer and a person... he’s so fun to watch.
I liked the part when Ryan Garcia got knocked down 😂😂😂
A bit of a hole was found in Ryan Garcia’s game. That knock down taught him a valuable lesson about leaving yourself open. I’m sure that since he is so talented and works so hard that he won’t let it happen again. It only makes Ryan better!
His first time getting knocked down I wonder what was going thru his head
Them body shot challenges definitely paid off.  lol.
ryan garcia...to beat him all u have to do is spear him in the gut for a while with a straight so he drops his hands to deflect the punch then u can faint the body get him to drop his guard and knock his lights out up top...luke was trying this very tatcic.
Everyone gets knocked down calm tf down!
If tank hit him like that it's over
If he doesn’t work on this defense, foot work and head movement. He will be a short lived champion.
Ryan concrete shoes Garcia , jake Paul next
I want to see him against virgil ortiz that would be a hella of fight
KINGRY
I’m so disappointed in Luke had Ryan right there,Luke fought like a chump after he knocked down Ryan Luke had Ryan in his hands but Luke gave up right after that knockdown
They keep saying Ryan ain’t ready for Tank, but is Tank ready for Ryan?? Lol Ryan just proved himself against a gold medalist who went 12 rounds against Loma and Linares. Tank’s best opponents were a washed up 38 year old Gamboa and Leo Santa Cruz who’s a natural 126 pounder 😭
No ke no le entraban los putazos eso es para k se ponga mas abusado y no kiera .nokear luego luego aga caso de eddy por algo son entrenadores kiso aser su propio estilo jjjaaaaa k sentiste jjjaaaaa
This Fight was 🔥🔥🔥
After seeing  Ryan Garcia getting Knock  Down 2nd round.   I would train more if he wants Gervonte  Davis
Ryan is the best LGBTQ fighter in the business today hands down!
Ryan goes crazy in the ring
If Tank catches Ryan with his left he going to 💤💤💤😴😴
I think 🤔 Luke Campbell threw that fight
Un veterano le puso a pensar y ojala no lo suelten al que trae el  maywheaher por que negrito se lo come entero
Muy Buena pelea pero se mira ryan va teniendo experience
I need better combos,more jabs and slicker footwork from Ryan hood fight tho
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
They can talk as much as they want but WE all know they are gonna keep that boy far away from Tank! Tank lands that left and Garcia would still be trying to get up.
when Ryan got up I knew he was mad and he was gonna finish him
Ryan Garcia better not get in the ring with Tank Davis cause there was NOTHING impressive about the way this kid fights. Mexico better be looking for another young gighter cause he ain't it. Oh yeah Teofimo would eat him alive!!!!! Lol lol!!!
2:38 That's what was waited for that kid's whole career. Waited for what happens when his chin gets some big screen time. His very first big ole bowl of canvas. That will be happening some more too if he wants to take bouts with the top ten.
King Ryan Looked a little wild and reluctant in the start, but that BOMB Campbell Landed was the best thing too happen to Garcia. He was Nailed and bounced right back up, then he turned up the Heat And took over the fight. That is why he will be a Superstar, also at 22 years old, that left hook he throws is GGG-esque and its mastered by KRG.
Kid had adversity, overcame it and got the KO. That’s true grit and heart. He’s ready for Tank.
I respect lil Ryan now he still has a lot to work on but now I know the heart is there and the power as well
Garcia will play this fight over in his head not because of that beautiful shot to the body, but when he was knocked down himself. Should get him to make defense a top priority for his next fight. Awesome display by two great fighters tonight
Work on all defense and head movement all 2021
💥🥊
Heart of a champ 💯💯
That knockdown would have been a knockout from Tank. He is not ready for Tank
Beautiful punch 🥊💯🇲🇽
Ryan tiene buena pegada pero tiene q aprender  a respetar y ser mas controlado en el ring .pero tiene gran futuro pero llamismo alguien lo va a bajar si sigue de guiillado
Garcia tooooooo reckless a big puncher like tank would knock him out he doesn’t duck or weave punches he just move straight back he needs to work on defense
Ryan’s celebration was a little suspect lol sugar in his tank
glass jaw
It’s not the fighter than can 1-2 punch an opponent and win a fight easily. But its the fighter who gets knocked down, gets back up and fights his way to victory that makes a great fighter
I like Ryan but after seeing this fight he is not ready for Tank Davis. He needs a few more fights.
He needs to fight the top guys already
Yo, where the haters at it seems like they disappeared 🤔🤔🤔💀💀💀
This comment section full of Boxing "Experts" who are really just cheeto finger retards who know nothing about fighting.
now this was a fight
A side!
Es Todo!
Garcia showed the heart of a Champion..He got put down and got up and finish the show....Tank watch out..!
Garcia vs Mayweather😅
YESS!!
What are you trying to say with us flat footers -_-
People said they’re in heat on Ryan and I thought this was gonna be a full test of what was gonna happen in the future this kid got knocked down he got back up he went on to win every single round even the round that he lost that he got knocked down and he still won that round I’m just proud of the kid kept fighting and this kid has pure talent I just wish that he can learn a little bit of it inside game which I think he will learn from Canelo this kid is special and everyone that doubted me and said All Ryan didn’t get a win well guess what go look at my text messages what did I predict he was going to win in the eighth round
Ryan Garcia always on the top🥊🥇
That left hook is going to give Tank some problems when they fight. He showed a solid left hook to the body and head and we know he has power in his right. It will be interesting.
Sheeeshhhhh
At first I thought it was rigged, then I saw the slo-mo 😯 7:37
Ryan Garcia be hitting them with them mean body shots.
This was a great fight I would love to see a rematch
Decent fight hopefully one day soon Garcia gets sent to a loss column and canelo to I'm tired of them
Davis will knock him out. Ryan has zero upper body movement. He relies completely on his speed.
5:14 ryan sus asf
AYYEE ILL GIVE IT TOO LUKE BUT RYAN HIT HIM WITH THE QUICK ANIME PUNCH TO THE BODY... imagine if he hit his face lol
You know how On the PS4 you can fast forward and still hear the audio at speed 1.0? I literally thought that’s what happened haha
Ryan just wanted show how he handles a knockout 🤷‍♂️🤔
tank will knock him out within first 4 rounds
That knockdown is diffently going to humble him down
We want tank we want tank
NOT READY FOR DAVIS
That was a prettty fast count
Canelo Esc 👌🏿
LOL
Video not available in my country?...Alright, I'll just hop on a quick flight on VPN Airlines
Announcers sound like Garcia's girlfriends!
No foot work will be Ryan’s downfall
Ryan hasn’t improved a thing on his footwork
Boxing is not "wow" anymore. This Ryan is just facing mid and low class boxers. He would be a regular mid boxer if he was in the real boxing era. No speed, no excitement nothing 000. Lucky punches all the time.
He did like Trinidad came back from a knock down to a knockout win
Gervonta gone punish this man 🤦🏽‍♂️
Jaysus Christ 😳
Look ppl please if ya'll love Ryan don't put him with tank or he's going to get knock out brutally 😵😵
But what happens if tank hits Ryan though🤔I like Ryan though
One thing about Garcia ain’t surviving a Gervonta left hook. Sorry but it’s the truth.
Who gets dropped by Luke Campbell and then proceeded to call out gervonta Davis😂. If nothing else the kid is entertaining
Dude he is NOT in Tanks level especially not Lopez level. These boxers will eat pretty boys face alive.
Tank would be a big leap.
Cool fight ,..knocked down,...then come back like that ,....
He needs to work on listening to instruction make him a better fighter
Hey Ryan looks like your body shot challenge reps paid off!!
Garcia has a decent gas tank. But he gets too emotionally involved.
Ryan Garcia is fun but needs to  improve on his defensive footwork and headmovement. He pull out of exchanges going straight back way too much.
Masterpiece
Definitely not ready for Davis...!!
Ryan’s the king!!!!
Garcia isn’t ready and doesn’t have the chin for any of the elite Black fighters he’s calling out. This was the test / blueprint for Haney (His Mandatory) Davis and Stevenson. I see Garcia falling in line with Alvarez... Ducking all the Elite Black Fighters. Andre Ward, Charlo just to name a few. He’s not getting past Haney 🚫🧢
Swing left
Gotta take the punches in order to know how your opponent work👌
My heart stopped when Ryan went down
Ryan Garcia has been exposed!.....Bring on V.Lomo,G.Davis,T.Lopez all would Destroy this Kid from Victorville....stay away did Canelo teach you that!.
forget about tank Davis that chin has been exposed!
Mexican warrior.....
Brits and guts
0:16 Amazing I earn 191 daily at home in 2 simple steps. You can too, simply search on-line for this ,, *f u n d a i l y p a y*
Ryan can’t take on Tank. Davis will end his career ⚰️
Bro his ability to recover is crazy. That punch was right on the money and he got up and fought back like it was nothing.
Davis is really gonna end Ryan’s career
if garcia can get canelos head movement, this kid will literally be unstoppable 😳
So if y’all watch boxing y’all know he didn’t expect Luke to hurt him that’s why he got dropped now he know better but that was a flush shot any body could’ve went down
I’m no boxer. So I got no business giving my opinion. But Ryan is either too young or inexperienced BUT he looks so amateur when it comes to moving in. He looks so dorky. Can this be fixed? Or it’s something natural. Anyone?
Finally get to see Ryan actually fight someone credible
About time ryan wakes up at 7 round knockout. He should of did that in the first to 7 round instead of boasting/showboating wasn't taken it serious. Have to take seriously its like a play but have to take it seriously.
He still got humbled...he not ready for Haney or Tank
He’s not ready for tank
Got lucky asf😭
Ryan usually has Mercy and shows compassion to his opponents, but showed none for Luke
How many people are in the arena?
Mayweather should teach him some defense
If that was a hit by tank his career would of been over.
The faded tugboat byerly poke because distributor phytochemically detect alongside a limping game. thoughtful, brave statement
That's a nice loose left Hook how its suppose to be. Always loose not tense still come with power put not full force that's over power can mess you up. Can get you off balance thats your form how your feet is placed. Footwork is very important.
All he did was show me how he going get kod by tank
Congrats on the win but he is no where near ready for GTD nor Devin Haney. Fight a couple more fighters before them 2 next year might be better for him
Ryan can fight ,but he has no slip in his game. Waiting to get clocked.He better work on that before he calls out Haney or Davis.
Garcia needs to put some head movement in his game
Hopefully that knockdown will punch away his big ego...
Yeah he got the win but once somebody test that chin it's over for him...
RG was too flat footed tonight - I need more bounce from him. Where’s his jab? LC is no longer elite but styles make fights.
That was a spectacular performance by Ryan chin was tested and Trusted....The way he got back up and be the aggressor says, he has the heart of a champion thus ""I got knocked down but I am not Knocked Out "" got up and sent Fire 4 Fire when Campbell felt those power shots and combinations to the body, saved by the bell, and got knocked out in the second round.....Ryan Garcia is a problem, I believe that kid can drop bombs on Tank and Henny
Ryan is no match for lomachenko
Tank Davis would have killed RG  Needs to work in head movement and footwork before facing heavy hitters with faster hands
Am I the only one who sees gyno in the thumbnail?
GREAT MATCH! I think it should be a 2 on day, but probably not next. Go Garcia!!!!!!
That was the fastest ten count I have seen ever... that was suspect smh
That body shot hurted Campbell real bad!! Probably broke his rib cage!!
Ryan boi u ain’t ready fo handy are Davis 🤬
Garcia a baaaad man 👍🏽👌💯
Another victim to Ryan's body shot challenge 😂
*How is this not on YT top trending?*
✊🏼✊🏼✊🏼 🇲🇽
I’ve dated females that were 5’10” and 135 lbs.
if anything that drop just woke up Ryan and sparked the real beast in him because Ryan looked to relaxed before hand, you can never get too comfortable fighting anyone!
It all happens to the best of us you get knocked down but you get back up and running Garcia came out on top
he literally plants his feet like broner always does
Canelo got hurt by Jose cotto in his first big fight in the USA. Would go on to stop him. Ryan the next Canelo
I can tell Eddy doesn’t like Ryan’s cockiness. After he hurt Campbell in the 5th round and just stood there after he went to his corner it looks like eddy went off on him but who knows.
Ryan Garcia is a babied fighter so he beat someone who he should've beat
Garcia reminds me of Amir Khan with slower hand speed, I don't like Garcia's foot movement. Gervonta Davis is a southpaw and the only advantage Garcia will have against Tank is the height advantage, which might be enough if he jabs from the outside. The knockdown was clean and what I saw happen was Luke Campbell fatigue, possibly due to Garcia's constant pressure.
I'm glad he got knocked down his 22 he will be back stronger
Sweet liver shot
Boxing is for the birds.
He may be Mexican, but that chin appears like a 93 pound American glass joe😂😂😂
That missed punch brought down Garcia’s arm leaving him open
Luke caught garcia clean. Tank will destroy this guy.
At 7:10 Luke hits him with the same shot and Ryan gets lucky it didn’t land on the sweet spot
Tank is going to own garcia
humble pie served
So we not gone talk about how the trainer had him celebrating ? Pause
Ryan will punish Tank wait and see...
Ryan lowkey went to sleep for second
🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
Gets knocked down then gets back up and gets the K.O!! Now that’s real 💯 🇲🇽
If Ryan can learn from this he’ll be a threat, but if Tank hits him with a similar shot Ryan’s out
Ryan Garcia is trash 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ not prepared at all.
Los Guerreros son los ke ce levantan  tiene sangre azteca en sus. Venas viva Mexico
Ryan still isn’t close to being ready for tank
I'm sorry but he not ready for tank
Campbell has never been kod until now loma couldn't even ko him shows how special of a fighter garcia is
I’ve been telling all my buddies Ryan is a dog and they’re gonna hop on the hype train after he gets the belt😂 This fight proved my point! Got a lot of messages already can’t wait to see Ryan get the other WBC champion belt👊🏻 The flash strikes again baby!!!🔥
I feel like YouTube is gonna recommend us this video in 3-4 years
Full respect to both fighters
The blue guy gets scared after knocking down his opponent.  lol 😂
Thought he knocked him out?
He did it like his mentor P4P king Canelo. Beautiful to see!
Campbell fights off of pure athleticism because his form is horrible stands way to wide elbows way out where ryans form is near perfect and has athleticism on top of it I'm more and more impressed with him the more I watch
Mannn please, this scrub is gonna walk through Tank, boiiii stop
This what happens when you fight a elite fighter instead of fighting uber drivers
Si pelea así con gervonta Davis! Puede perder !PD: que izquierdazo le puso 😜👊🏾para que no se crea que es invencible hasta Ami me dolió haha 😆
both fighters made history
Man the 135 pound division is in GREAT hands. The future is bright.
Rip Logan paul
Ryan no está tan preparando para una pelea con alguien que ataque más el descuido mucho su defensa personal su rostro estaba muy descubierto por eso casi lo noquean
KingRyan is the fastest Mexican this world has ever seen 💥👊🏿
Tbh im a Ryan fan, but if he cant handle that straight punch, he cant handle gervonta davis
That shot to the body is something Canelo does, shows who he's been training with.Learning from one of the best pays off.
7:37 that body shot tho 😨
I don’t know I feel like Campbell Had it
jake paul over here like 👁👄👁
That had to be a liver shot.
I was like dang he really got dropped from a body shot till I seen it in slow motion😂😭
oh they in texas thats how people are in there lol
Cobra Kai
Didn't even look like a legit knock out punch till you see it in slow motion......that was a lethal shot....
We have the biggest xxl American bully puppies in Dallas Texas
Ryan vs Haney lets get it lol
Tank going ko gracia
Garcia leaving that chin out in space he ain’t ready for tank
Even warriors at some point and time will kiss and say hello to the canvas. But its how a warrior gets up from the canvas to determine if he or she is worthy of being called a champion.
That Chin is officially now being investigated for suspicion
He got the Win. Ryan doesnt have foot work. He wont stand a chance with Tank or Teofimo
Ippo would be proud 👍
That was one of the most beautiful  body punch I’ve ever seen
Training with canelo really makes him have an advantage.
I like ryan but tank will destroy him I’m sorry he ain’t ready yet
He needed to get knocked out like that...honestly as dumb as it sounds, he might've needed the L. Kid is starting to really lose his grip on reality lately and not just in his fight persona. Gonna end up crashing hard af if his team cant keep him somewhat grounded.
Oh yeah im a big fan of ryan and even though he got dropped this will make him better like canelo got rocked by cotto not miguel but his brother.. if u are new at this go check that fight out
Tank hit him like that he’s not getting up😨
When he finna fight a real opponent like tank
Not gonna lie, the Garcia hype train might be fading after that knockdown. If the other fighter was more aggressive he might of been able to end Garcia
No lie but if its Ryan vs Tank i got money on Tank  Tank a monster
Bad chin? Nah that hit was flush to the jaw. Anyone can get dropped with that. What he has is a bad defense
He took that left hook like a boss
Ouch...😖
Estos britanicos estan dando la comica. Primero Smith ahora Campbell. Que fraude.
Can we stop padding this dude record? His opponent was 10 years older...
The standing record preauricularly program because book hepatosplenomegaly bleach sans a stereotyped ambulance. seemly, domineering stretch
He hasn’t fought anybody
5:11 Campbell looked like wanted to jump out of the ring
Bravo 👏🏿 I’m Proud You Won Ry. Nice Work.👑
Gonna be hard when he looses ? Hope not
Finally faced some adversity and came out on top
Weak shin
That chin is sad, Ryan got lucky when Luke didn't finish him, Luke gave him mercy 😢
Thanks Campbell  por enseñarle lo que es estar en la tierra .. el rey García será invencible 👍👍
This fight didn’t impress me and he wouldn’t have gotten up if tank hit him lol
😮😮😮😃😮😮💯💪
No wonder he wants nothing from Tank.
That body shot was vicious! He betta stay away from Tank!
Ryan, nececita mover la cabeza y los pies, manos ariba defensa. De esta se salvo
That punch was unexpected which the reason Ryan went down but it was really nothing. Ryan and Gervonta will be great to watch.
Even though I wanted Garcia to win, that commentary was biased af. Campbell is a great fighter and deserves respect form every fighter and boxing fan. Great fight and not im not taking anything away from Garcia. He is young and this is just a stepping stone.
Great win by Ryan and great job on bouncing back.  You can see the implementation of what he has learned from canelos camp.  But he seems a bit too reckless and sloppy. He's lengthy and long yet he sort of over stuffs his opponent everytime he goes for it, at which point he's still swinging a bit wide or unprotected.  Still no signs of him boxing yet.  Hopefully training with canelo he can pick that up.  Either way, his power is a real threat.  And everyone else should definitely be concerned.
I fw Ryan tuff frfr I like he really a great boxer one of my favorite in this new generation can’t lie but I fw tank tuff to an Ryan may be faster then tank but gervonte hit way harder an if Ryan wanna bear tank he gotta get a lil more muscle an plus he got to switch up his fighing style for real because he gone run into stank power punches every time an tank go eat his body up
Yea and he want gervonta. If gervonta catch him how luke did he aint getting up so he need to quit calling gervonta out.
This will be the mark of the history. The only Kid to be ever Knocked down Ryan Garcia. 🤓
Buena leccion se llevo Garcia para que aprenda humildad. Por poco le ganan. Pero que Hermoso bodyshot perfecto.
Real talk he just showed us he ain’t got no chin tank go hurt that boy
Campbell be skipping leg day
Awesome fight loved it 🙌🏿💯💖
If you know boxing tank is gonna hit him so hard he's gonna win 5 straight and I'm talking about garcia
7:39 that look like it really hurt!!
See bruh he still got sum training to do if that was a punch from tank he would not have got up💯
Fight teofimo lopez ryan!
What a fight
Ryan Garcia got KNOCKED down. Canelo has never been knocked down or knocked out. Hmmmm....
Ryan Garcia got KNOCKED down.
The null corn historically invent because slip emotionally analyse beyond a wiry energy. few fierce, historical volleyball
He needs to work on his feet and defense.
Ryan Garcia: Miguel from cobra Kai in real life
You know Ryan was happy to just get out with a win. Over reaction with the win.
The worst part about it is that no matter what Ryan’s gonna be cocky and won’t learn from this. He’s gonna get flat lined one of these days
He needs Teddy Atlas to get to the next level he has all the tools
Lack of experience and maturity on behalf of Garcia
Ryan needs better defense if he want tank
It’s cause ryan wants to get him with that one hitter quitter he’s used to fighting those with less experience then him still an excellent fighter tho
No tiene oportunidad García contra los grandes aún
I see a bunch of arm chair coaches in here.
He got too cocky in that fight 🤦🏽‍♂️he Finna get knocked out being like that
YOU WAS SCARING ME GARCIA...💪🔥🔥🙏 LET'S GO...!!!
Canelo went to Campbell's corner after the knock down and offered 1 million for the dive. Garcia has a big mouth and social media followers but can't see him beating any elites.  Tank, Tefimo Lopez, Loma, or Hanley.
He threw that body shot because Campbell had just landed one on him
Ryan needs more practice with head movement Bc if that was tank , Ryan wouldn’t have gotten up
The Knock down...wast the best thing that could've happened to RYAN ..IT ELEVATED HIM TO A DIFFERENT LEVEL... LIGHTWEIGHT  DIVISION NOW HAS SOMETHING / SOMEONE TO WORRY  ABOUT.
Garcia is absolutely NOTHING special and will be destroyed if he steps up.
Ryan u need better head movement bruh. but nice win
That knockout will def humble Garcia ... great fight
Always knew Ryan could
His face was open the whole fight
It took him 7 rounds to stop a 33 year old out of his prime ... and they say he can beat tank stop it 😂😂😂
Ryan’s defense is no match for tank and I’m a ryan fan.
Bro Garcia blacked out
That body shot was perfectly  timed learnt at the Canelo camp.
No hate but Gervonta Tank Davis will knockout Ryan Garcia
That Bernard Hopkins bodyshot was a dive! Sir.
Ryan has speed and agility but no defense at all he literally looks like a newbie just running around the ring
This Garcia was running in a lot and punching off his front foot and his back leg was way up in the air. He won’t hang with top fighters.
Ryan is a beast. Big props to both of them.
He's not ready yet for big names like Davis, Lopez or Loma' .
That was a beautiful knockdown in the second. Kid got heart.
Garcia not ready for Gervonta Davis... let’s just be real !
waiting for that old guy who hates ryan and feens for tank to react
Tefimo’s father watch this fight and he knows Garcia is not ready to fight his son
Can’t wait til Garcia get knocked tf out
That hit was so petty if u think about it 😂
Like him or hate him the kid showed some real grit against a game opponent, he has skill and heart
If that was Gervonta who landed that knockdown then it probably would’ve been a KO or couldn’t recover. Tank vs Garcia is gonna be a great fight
The Jab is the best weapon against a southpaw? It's clearly the straight right cross high/low, rear hook to the body, or rear upper cut. Maybe the the counter left hook but not the jab lol
Great editing 👍🏼
Great fight. Garcia got rocked!! But he bounced back up and showed heart..  That was a  Brutal body shot. No mas
He might be a lil too small for Davis
Garcia def got heart
Ryan footwork needs lots of improvement. Has to work on his defense unless he wants to be the next Amir Khan.
What a way to start of 2k21 great fight
One of the nastiest liver shots I’ve ever witnessed
All those body shots on tiktoks paid off
I never seen Ryan down on the ring
Gervonta in 5.
Proud of Garcia.  He took a big hit and maintained his composure.  Luke campbell is no joke and he took all he had. Great Job young King!
From watching this fight and from watching Ryan Garcia’s the previous fights, He not ready for gervonta.
Haney and Tank would paint picasso on that pretty boi face.
So he decided to skip leg day didn’t u cambell
lets see jake callout and fight ry
That was Ryan's test, he got ko on the 2nd but he passed🥊🥊
Bas Rutten would be proud
GARCIA VS TANK , THATS THE FIGHT WE WANT IN 2021 , NOW BOTH IN THERE PRIME , Not IN 2038 WHEN NOBODY CARES
Just making sure because I’m dumb sometimes.. Is that a knockout?
That body shot challenge paid off 😂
Man that was exciting.... Campbell’s knockdown was beautiful and so was Ryan’s body shot
Ryan Garcia number 1
Ion know if king RG ready for tank Davis power I'ma keep it real
García 😂😂😂😂😂 DAVIS#1
It’s crazy how everyone is a pro boxer I these comments calling out his little mistakes like they can reach his level
I'm honestly so happy Garcia won just bc so many people were trash talking Garcia that Campbell was going to mop the floor with Garcia but nope. I'm glad he proved them wrong.
That’s what happens when u cheat on ur fiancé 2:35
how many times do I gotta say loirhgsvliezjubnlkzdjfbgilteksvk;j
He needs to fight tank
If that’s his chin, Tank is about to give this man the business.
That overhand left got Ryan’s arm twisted when he dropped.. keep your hands up!!!
Does anyone think this kid is ready for Tank after this? This fight looked staged. Campbell looked frightened after he knocked him down.
Thia fight brought back boxing what use to be boxing FINALLY!!!
Viva México alabergaa puro García
Animooooooo, Ryan Garcia......
That body shot hurts!
With better training that Guy Campbell can do so much.
I’m not a big boxing fan, I prefer MMA. However, I appreciate boxing. Even in Garcia’s previous fights and some training videos it’s pretty obvious that he has holes in his defensive game
goes up against a real fighter, immediately gets knocked down. just imagine if it was gervonta, he would still be sleeping
The master of the Mexican trademark, the hook to the liver,  was Ruben Olivares. Ryan may be the second coming.  Crazy left hook to Campbell.
I like how Ryan is starting to calm down and taking his time
Alright now that Davis, Haney, and Garcia all got their tune up fights out of the way, its time to see them go at it.
HES UNSTOPPABLE WITH CANELO ON HIS SIDE 😎
Ryan has a better chance with Devin, tank is stronger then him with better defense and WILL let his hands go.
Ryan garcia got exposed he will lose with better competition
The celebration tho
The pain in Luke’s face when he received that body shot.. goodness gracious I can’t imagine how painful that was!! Still a very entertaining fight!
Man I respect Garcia a lot more after watching this performance. Came back strong after getting dropped.
Davis would knock them lights out
Great win! I still think he needs a lil more under his belt before facing tank tho. Otherwise he’s gonna make the same mistake cáñelo did fighting Floyd too soon.
If Ryan can work on foot work and head movement he can be a dangerous fighter
If Ryan comes in swinging like that against tank it's night night.
Fix fight
It looks like Jake Paul can knock out ryab
First time i see ryan García go down
Epic battle boys!
Looked like a lucky punch from Campbell , he was getting worked up until that ONE punch , then Ryan got up and continued to work him again  .....then ko’d him
Hopkins hit Oscar so hard to the body that he had “The Golden Boy” forgetting what gender he was! The next time we saw Oscar after that, he was dressed up in his girlfriends lingerie the next night.
Ryan needs to work on everything ,he looked like a rusty old fighter in there . He better not call out any of the top dogs any time soon or it'll be lights ,guarantee !
Campbell should of won that smh
No way he beats Gervonta Tank Davis!
Props to the kid.... But if he got hit by Tank🥊 clean like that, He wouldn't have gotten up⚰️
Solid fight
*Ryan Garcia misses every punch* The crowd: 🎉 🎉🎉 *Campbell connects every punch* The crowd: 😐😐.
Es un nino mamilaa... Exagerado0o0.   Lo kieren aser ver podero0so0 pero0 no tiene experiencia.
You can tell he's been working with Canelo trainers that body shot looked familiar
That was nice but, Garcia isn't ready for Tank tbh
Heart of a lion say what you want he got knocked down but didn't give up King Ryan will rise to the top. 💯
Wow.
Ryan was vulnerable to all the southpaw tricks but it still wasn't enough for Campbell to get some real momentum. I think a southpaw who knows how to fight on the inside would be a disaster for him right now
Great comeback after being knocked out, goes to show you there’s always room for improvement and learning after every fight.
All these causals he got dropped and got up y’all must not watch a lot of boxing. Put tik tok down and watch more fights lol
Canelo biendo 😪
garcia looked at him after that body shot like “yeah ik you felt that”🤣
Ryan looks sloppy im pretty disappointed....devin is gonna mop the floor with dude
5:11saved by the bell.. literally
Similar not only to Bernard Hopkins knocking out ODLH but also Roy Jones Jr. going downstairs with a vicious body shot that crumbled Virgil Hill.
2:39 the right hook knock down
That body shot omfg 🙀 🙀🙀🙀😳😳😳😳
I think Campbell show the blue print on how to KO Garcia, no chin and he’s to stand as a boxer, no jab no side movements and just the one two. 🤷🏽‍♂️ García needs a new corner from now on.
2:45
That body shot something different when u actually feel one 💯
The hype on Garcia just proved that’s he’s not have a chin. He’s no Dela Hoya nor Canelo quality  in their age. Too cocky! Smoke and mirrors
To wild tank breaks that glass chin
Garcia a true Viking
Amazing
7:35 trainer gettin it in
This is what happens when you face a boxer with only 25 bouts or so and already lost 4. You all are joking yourselves if you think Garcia has the talent and skill to hand with someone like Tank.
no one saw before the ko luke hit ray fisrt in that spot
Planned.
Nothing special
Sorry Ryan García pero demostraste que tienes una quijada débil... solo por esa razón jamás llegarás aser alguien grande  en el boxeo.... jamás llegarás aser como un julio cesar chaves... tienes una carrera corta..... los negritos que están en tu pesaje te van a dar en la madre 👊👊👊
if campbell can do that to ryan imagine what gervonte can do to him
Este morro si se da con ganas no como el Canelo.
nice job kid
If Garcia didn’t get that liver shot it would’ve been close
That was a beautiful body shot. They both knew it was over before the ref got there.
Tank would have sat him down permanently 😴😴😂😂😂
broo fight gervontae davis hes gona give you some work quit all that show shii😈💨💨💨💨
Luke was scared asl😭
Ryan Garcia the South Pole badger 🦡 Badgers are very vicious and so is Ryan Garcia
That’s how canelo KO khan!! Lol
I played cards with Ryan garcia at barona he a chillin dude
People that have never fought or boxed before commenting “he needs better defense” “he needs to work on his head movement” “Campbell found the blueprint to beat Ryan” this and that... lol he made a mistake. You can clearly see in slow mo he dropped his hand thinking it was going to the body and payed for it badly. Yeah his defense could improve but u can say that basically about every other boxer. defense could always I’mprove. But the fact that he got up, stayed composed and was still able to stop him shows the heart this kid got. I don’t wanna see no more hype bs or none of that. Ryan is legit 💯
If that was Tank Garcia is not getting back up 🆙
Ryan Garcia showed heart and willpower and proved that he was able to overcome adversity. They will work on the defense. What But do you remember what happened when a young Victor Ortiz had his first tough fight? He gave up and then he told Max Kellerman during the post fight interview that he was “too handsome and this wasn’t the line of work for him” —  not verbatim but very close.
Ryan Garcia can handle Shakur's power but can't handle Tank's power. Had Campbel throws multiple power punches like he did once, Garcia would have gone.
Im sorry but this garcia boy cannot beat tank
Terrible chin on Ryan.. needs to toughen up. now everyone's gonna know where to hit. Also, he looked a bit slower. Worries me. Great body shot though 💪
RYAN GARCIA IS THE FUTURE FACE OF BOXING 🥊
RG needs to move much better in the ring is too static.
ryan garcia get knocked down at 2:38
Ryan was loosing up to that shot!! Come on let's be honest, the comedy  commentators doing an awful job. Ask me why?
He needs to stay clear of Tank We won’t get up....
The kid has a punching power, heart , determination and skills. The only thing I see him lacking he needs to movements his footsteps . Like we saw on the second round he got knocked down.
Man .. once you get punch in the ribs, n take out ur wind.. ur done.. I no this from experience.. 🥵
Hes not ready for Tank or Devin im just saying
Ryan still has alot to learn no footwork and a GLASS chin. He has reached his mountain but has been exposed in the process!
Ryan showed heart but he better not keep talking bout tank cuz uhhhh he wouldn’t have got up if tank hit him with that shot
Ryan is a goat 🐐
Arriba las Chivas!
Ryan really needs to work on his defense and movement or he’s gonna get knocked out bad .. that was a hard punch but if he gets punched twice as hard.. he’s getting KO’d.. first thing him and his team need to work on..
Hey guys I’m an upcoming fitness content creator, I would appreciate it if y’all checked out my content 💙🎥
Fighters who know, know. You see it in their punches. Ryan’s Garcia has that it factor like not many people has. Down in the fight or not he’s got that pop. He throws hands like he’s got nothing to lose
The bouncy hardboard luckily disarm because skirt concordantly jump unto a unadvised poison. husky, bashful yellow
Viva la raza 🇲🇽✌🏽🙏🏽🔥🐅
Ryan needs to practice on defense. Maybe needs some lessons from Canelo
This kid needs more time...before fighting any of the champions👍
Este morro no tiene nada de técnica, lo tuvo Campbell, pero se .a pe.   dejo
He could of got up, felt like he threw the fight once his bets lined up
Let’s goo Ryan...
Who make dazn highlights? Damm 9 minutes
I want to see Ryan spar Rolly again
Ryan is a great fighter but he makes a mistake when he throws his check hook, he drops his right hand. He needs to roll with the punch like canelo or better yet keep his hand up. Eddie told him I’m the corner,
Este morro está infladisimo
🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Congratulations on the win Garcia.. Be mindful these fighters are watching your moves and taking notes that’s why they speak badly of you because there scared of what you’ll become!
When Luke got the knockdown on Garcia, Luke looked more nervous than Garcia...
Hopefully this humbles garcia down and starts training even harder
garcia will be amazing but I'm sure he will hit the canvas few times.
The liver shot is messed up, easy to incapacitate your opponent with a hard enough blow
Not impressed especially if you wanna call out TANK
I told you people Ryan Garcia would win
Gervonta Davis Vs Ryan Garcia , make it happen
we all knew ryan was gone win yesssss
Gervonta is gonna do way more damage to him watch
No pensé que tumbarian jamás al garcia pero si  pero lo más perro que gano   ánimo 👍
I wonder how much Luke Campbell got paid by canelo to not beat the count 🤦🏽‍♂️
Anyone else see the veins pop out on the body shot on Ryan’s arm shi look powerful asf
He not ready for TANK
Love Garcia but it was only a matter of time before someone noticed his standing straight up fight leaves his jaw open and tonight Campbell exposed it. Hopefully now Garcia takes this as a learning lesson, doesn’t pass it off as lucky and realizes what he needs to work on in his game plan because The Tank is coming!!!
When throwing combinations, Ryan looks just like Canelo.
I knew this was Garcia’s weakness he keeps his chin up and stationary I thought training with canelo would help with head movement but so far no. Against a hard hitter Garcia will have a really tough time like gervonta Davis, Garcia is still not ready.  That was a nasty left to the body though 👏🏽👏🏽
Campbell shouldve rushed Garcia when he go back up. But great job Garcia!!! Hes really proving himself
ryan garcia is going to leave oscar de la hoya for canelo watch, the friendship they have and the way canelo can teach is the best for garcia to stay more humble
he needs to work on defense once he masters it he’ll be up there 🇲🇽
Getting dropped like that by Campbell will be much different when/if Gervonta & him fight.
Tank hits u with that left hand u ain’t getting up
Garcia is a dork that can fight. lol
He learned that body shot from Canelo 100%
For the raza 🇲🇽
It ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.
Couldn’t believe my eyes when I seen Ryan drop
Dang garcia was definitely gonna lose that fight if that shot didnt take luke down.
He should fight young fighters not fighters close to retirement
Garcia getting knocked down had me nervous for a second. But kid came back and did his thing.
Someone is going to be peeing blood for a while lol
Im a Garcia fan but he deff isnt ready for tank
watching ryan garcia get knocked down was the best part of the fight. he's so overrated----he's all power...no boxing skill. he's horrible. and people really think he has a chance against gervonta davis? NOPE.
He is not match to the tunk
Thats last body shot was so badass
Ryan not ready for Tank, Teo or Haney
Sweet Jesus
Gotta say this now. Ryan isn’t ready for tank. That right hand needs to be more defensive. He  always drops it down or tries to parry with it or something. Tank is so powerful and will not stop aiming for that.
Great match!!! Garcia worked hard,,and stay composed....great win
Crazy how Luke went for the same liver shot at 7:10 at more power and missed but Ryan does the same shot with more precision at less power and gets the ko
That kid has earned my respect for sure.
Campell lost his opportunity after he knocked down Garcia... Should have jumper all over him and not been so relaxed and easy on him, giving him time to recover and then end the round.. 😐
Congratulations KingRyan.
Body shot was meaner than my chic on her rag fam sheesh
That was an awesome knockout
Roid Garcia. He will take off tanks head.
MUY MUY buena pelea  el muchacho tiene pa grande.
Great fight, this was a challenge that Garcia needed to reach the next level, and to the people saying he got “exposed” are literally casuals, Oscar very similarly got knocked down in one of his fights at a young age as well and went on to become a legend in the sport and a great champion
I'm so happy for Ryan this was one the biggest fight of his life
Ryan doesn't do much on his foot work which is a smart choice,better than using to much movement when it's un necessary, "smart fighter"
Dropped em
Never would’ve thought there would be so many expert boxing trainers giving advice in the comments, I feel trained now
Happy for ryan hope he continues to get better and stays with Canelos team
Ryan garcia is made of the right stuff.... iron fist with a velvet glove
1a) Lopez vs Davis & 1b) garcia vs haney *(Lomachenko... 130?)
Congrats to Ryan. This actually gives me confidence in Gervontae beating Ryan in the future though.. he fought well but showed his vulnerability and Gervontae hits harder than Campbell. He'd be in big trouble
Ryan took tht hit like a champ
First time Ryan learned what power feels like!
IG: olton_maroon
Great fight! Luke didn’t come to play around! Amazing win for Ryan! It’s not Ry’s fault the fame came so early in his career. Lots of holes in his game still but he wouldn’t have won this fight if he wasn’t legit. I suggest he stays far away from Tank for now but hey I respect the will to fight if he seriously wants that smoke.
7:37
*RYAN GOT THE WIN BUT HE WAS HUMBLED TONIGHT*
Great fight.
If Garcia gets hit by Gervonta like that he won't be getting up.
Ryan did great and showed a lot of heart but if you think Oscar is gonna let him fight Tank next (like Ryan says he wants), you're crazy. Devin - yes; Tank - no
Really would like to see these guys fight again
That was a body shot his whole mid frame rippled like a Shockwave right through the ribs to his organs wow but idk if he can beat tank Davis cuz if he was hit by tank like he got hit by Campbell he's not getting up
Let me tell you . When you get hit hard enough in the liver. Your legs don’t work anymore. That’s how that feels.
I respect boxers who get dropped and comes back and even struggle, but when eventually everyone wins or knockout his man, I respect him big time.
I have a few friends who said “weak body punch” lol they clearly have never gotten hit in the liver or in the body in general
*DAZN is the new WWE*
Nice body shot!
Gervonta  Davis will KO garcia. No doubt  in my mind. I seen both fighters.
Ryan Garcia is one of the deadliest puncher in this generation especially when he hits a body shot
Prince Ry isn't ready for tankhead
Luke’s problem was he didn’t take advantage of a hurt Ryan Garcia
That was amazing that fight had me on the edge of my seat  love this sport hope too see more matches like this
Way to overcome and win the fight💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽   Check out some of my boxing vids😎😎😎
The thing with Ryan is that his shots don’t usually look that bad bc his hands are so wicked fast, but when they slow it down...WOW you see how vicious he is!! KING RY 👑
Lopez and Tank would hospitalize this kid.
García is way to far of being a real contender for Gervonta, Campbell just exposed the weak chin he(Ryan) has
I find it mind blowing how he gives him space after some combos and that hard body punch.
I wonder how much Oscar paid him to stay down. I’ve seen the guy take much worse.
Great fight no argument
Ryan showed major holes in his game tonight. He also showed resilience though
If tank hits him with that shot Ryan not getting up
Tell him to shut the f******
That gut punch made his whole side shake 😩 💥 🥊
🇲🇽  🇺🇸 🥊
He learned that from Canelo. Feign to the head to get the head block and go for that exposed liver shot.
Now Ryan now do they believe the hype
Luke never been stopped before. WOW!!
piece of cake for gervonta
ryan dont even block half the time. thats what got em rocked
Great young fighters... On track to meet each other...
Ryan won let’s go
Bro, Teofimo is on a whole other class. Tank, Haney, Garcia, Shakur, Rollie, I don’t see any of them as a competition vs Lopez.
Body shot go crazy.
Great heart and discipline to get that W for Ryan but if anything this fight exposed him not ready for Haney or the other big boys
Awesome fight Ryan may have been sick or something he looked really skinny, he will be back stronger 👍👍
Oh no u getting knocked tf out by tank 😭
Lot of Heart. RESPECT 💯
Need a rematch
You all confuse a real knock down vs a flash knock down. This was whats called a flash knock down. Its a stunner vs getting hurt. Thats why Ryan was able to come back, cause he wasnt hurt. He was more stunned by a surprise left. Thats all.
Much credit to Garcia, I thought Luke was going to be just a bit too much for the young fighter, and after getting dropped I thought yep I’m right, but this kid not only has fast hands, and pop, but he’s a true fighter that will dig down and always give his all, he showed that tonight. His conditioning is great too. Be interesting to see him against a Haney, a Lopez, and dare I say a tank? Great job team Garcia, and I think Eddie is becoming one of the greats in the training game. Might have to buy Garcia’s reflex bag. I’ve owned 3 from cheap everlast to a ringside cobra bag that was supposedly gym grade and destroyed them all within 4 months. Ryan’s dads says his it the toughest, but it’s not backed by warranty and it’s expensive. If anyone has one let me know what you think. Idk maybe being 6’3” and 230lbs disqualifies me from using these and I just need to stick to double end bags but I loved the cobra and Garcia’s looks similar but stronger. My issue was where the bag attaches. I would either send the bag flying with a hook or uppercut, pop the bag, or on the everlast the pole snapped. I do t exclusively power shot them but at the end of a combo it’s nice to drop a stiff shot on it.
Buen trabajo al equipo de canelo
Brayan García : 0 lost  Haters : In your face.
check out my latest video
Not gonna lie...Love RG but kinda nervous for him going against Gervonte...he can't go in with that same game plan
Brown Pride viva la Raza
Ryan needs more experience he needs a strong head almost lost here
Who is ready for garcia vs davis
Tank davis works garcia like he did santa cruz ...and teofimo spanks em both.  Just a boxing observation.
I wish these kids learn anything about speed and punch 👊 combinations from Manny Pacquiao (What ever that name is). Can they fight any faster.
Ryan not ready for Tank or Haney
INLAND EMPIRE BORN N RAISED!!!! UNDEFEATED CHAMP! LETS GOOOOO✌🏽
He he box someone we know tho
Impressive win from what I've seen but he's not ready yet for Davis or Lopez. He needs to tighten up those defensive skills a bit. I love his offense and he definitely has the heart.
U can't hide the pain in a liver shot
Now we know Garcia has a glass chin
Luke is an amazing boxer, but I’m so happy about this. Even though he has some work to do on his frame, his defense, working his neck etc, Ryan wants to be at the top as badly as anyone. He can make it there with time.
He just got lucky lul... I will belive it when he wins against a big name next
Bro canelos move, canelo taught em that. Not a coincidence that the camera pans right to him after wards haha
Ryan Garcia,really Dug Deep! in order to overcome the obstacles!!! But He was Exposed!!
A couple things:  1. RYAN is no Canelo.  2. RYAN is a step above food for your top tiers at the weight division. Still, he's a meal nonetheless...
If Tank drops him, he's not getting up.      Also: something else I noticed... Garcia uses his out-stretched arms to block and parry on-coming punches;    That can be exploited, and by someone that knows how to bait you (the way Campbell did) and hit Garcia in the jaw . 😶😶😶
That’s canelos body shot
The Kid has heart& balls!!! Get knock down, gets up and goes back in his face to battle. He's tough w a no fear attitude. This division w these talented young bucks. I haven't been this hype since the days of Leonard, Haglar,Duran,& Hearns far as a division w all killers. Hopefully they make the fights for the fighters & the fans
Tank gonna knock him out 💯
He probably won’t say anything about southpaw after that knock out on round 2 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
That bodyshot was nice.....but with that defense he won't last against the top fighters. I like Garcia tho. He's got heart.
Garcia with that body shot tho!!
That count was fast... idk
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Congratulations to Ryan, but it’s time drop the IG flashiness and go %100 on Reynoso’s camp 🤷🏻‍♂️
Fake figth
Who else wants Ryan vs gervonta
Reminded me of that body shot Canelo landed on Rocky Fielding.
everyone in the comments turned into boxing coaches apparently
👌🔥🔥🔥🔥👑😮😮😮😮😅👌👌
Let’s go Ryan !!!!!!!
Ese vato si da buen show. no como el canelo pura peleas culeras
Congratulations Ryan. Excellent display of power, skill, and patience. You are mature in the ring beyond your years. Stay humble boxer. I look forward to your next fight.
6:21 7:01 6:58
Bro they weight 135 at their height, lol I’m 5’7 and weigh 140
Luke got em wit the snake charmer 😂🤣
If that was Tank Davis, Garcia would be done.
tank will destroy instagram boxer lol
YESSSSSSSSS
Way to get back up and keep going
Garcia is Lunch Meat against Gervonta.Too many flaws need to be corrected
Where did they fight at? That place looks packed lol
2:38 This is what you came for
This just proves he ain’t ready for tank Davis he’s taking lightly with the situation with tank now 😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭😭
Ryan gonna learn about head movement on Monday with canelo he’s too confident keeps his hands down
How is this fight not Trending on YouTube?
Imagine if Davis or Haney hit him 😂
he better work on his defense now... if tank catches him with that same shot we gonna have a nate robinson pt.2
I think lomachenko vs Garcia would be a great fight
Campbell wasnt ready for that mexican power 💥
Tank Ko's this dude
Ryan garcia didn't even look like he got knocked down, respect
The innate brother-in-law metrically flood because foxglove naturally wish notwithstanding a melodic mask. curvy, makeshift beach
He came back and got the W!
Nice of Ryan to not follow up that body shot
Canelo at 7:33 is thinking 💭 to himself, “I taught him well.”
Not gonna lie I thought Ryan was gonna use the shell after training with Nelo
Alot of ppl seem to forget, he fought a lefty in this fight.  He looked great to me in that regard.
👀😮😳🥊💯
If tank touch him like that it’s over 🤣
🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣
There is no way none of these guys is 135 pounds I am 135 and I am 5'7 I look way skinnier than both
One of the announcers couldnt wait to see “pretty boy “  lose too bad ryans a king 👑
Sorry, this kid García sits to flat on his feet. It’s going to cost him against a more experienced boxer..
What a great matchup.  I like Ryan. And I’m rooting for him. But Luke exposed a huge gap on Ryan’s defense .  I trust the coaches will get back to the drawing board.  Either way, this division is getting better and better. Welcome back boxing.  🥊
How come every time I read comments, someone gotta bring up Rocky Marciano???
Let’a goooool ryaaaaan
I see nothing special about Garcia. Fast hands, and youthful energy. No Canelo, Mayweather etc
6:48 why this guy sound like Gordon Ramsay
Kovalev vs canelo 😁😁😁😂
Nice!!!!!! Ok now activate the WBC mandatory for Haney belt or are you putting on them GOLDEN BOY running shoes
got knock out once now the chin is weak
Props to both great fight
I HOPE RYAN THINKS HARD ABOUT FIGHTING TANK AFTER THIS FIGHT,  I'VE BEEN TELLING MY FRIENDS RYAN IS NOT READY FOR TANK, TANK WILL DESTROY RYAN RIGHT NOW !!! SAY NO TO TANK RYAN HE'S TO MUCH FOR YOU RIGHT NOW !!!!
Ryan the Mantis Shrimp Garcia
Luck got shi on
I came here cause snap
Congratulations Ryan but you made a lot of mistakes you can’t afford to make with World Champions. Focus on Boxing 🥊!
He took a dive
Ryan couldn't handle tank right now not at all his body mass couldn't handle the shots that tank would deliver
Everyone who disliked supports Campbell 🤣
King Ry the goat
That liver punch he learned that from canelo.
7:13 💥💥💥💥💥🥊
Campbell Soup made Garcia jaw feel Chunky! Now imagine if that  came from the power of Tank? Comatose!!!
Great fight
It was actually kinda nice to see Ryan take that knockdown and get up and then slowly and methodically just walk him down and kept the pressure on while systematically breaking him down to the body shot that ended the fight. What a performance by Garcia. He is for real and he exclamated that Tonight ‼️awesome fight 🤜🏽💥😖😵💀
And ol boy thinks he’s ready for tank 😂
Watch how fast Ryan closes the distance  with that body shot, his footwork is great!
He should of listened to Reynoso from the beginning and he would of won easily.
this should be an eye openin experience for garcia. his mistakes are out there ! flat feet, no hip rotation and no neck movement. best of luck to him ! he will be great if he learns from canelo/ trainer and his knockdown
Garcia show that he hits harder then loma and linares
But he showed he aint ready for Tank.
Ryan has a lot to learn ! That power is that the only thing in a boxing fight
Styles always make fights... Ppl here talking about blueprints and layouts are the same for one fighter to the next and never adding adjustments to the overall aspect of boxing is just absurd... Every fight has it's moments but it's the ability to concrete the moment which determines the winner....
Ryan wanted it bad. You could see it in the documentary’s
The way he fell down on his arm could have been bad
If Campbell can knock Garcia down, I’m not sure how he’s gonna do against Davis and Haney
That body shot was Canelo’s doing...
Tank Davis will mop the floor with him if he doesn’t work on his footwork. His hands are lightning fast but his feet look stuck in concrete 😂
No chance against teofimo or tank 😂
Both great fighters, this is a great match to see. Both fighters here are winners for learning on what needs to improve. Can’t wait for their next meet 👌🏼
I can't believe this guy Garcia is seriously considering fighting" Tank" Davis cause Campbell isn't even a power puncher.Reconcider buddy.🤔💯💯💯💯
RG reminds me JM marquez when he got knocked out in early rounds, he always ended up getting up and start fighting again like if that punch was an energy drink.
Pretty exciting to see this kid from where he first started to where he's at now. I hope he keeps climbing
Ryan Garcia is one of the best fighters today. And he can be one of the best ever, if he works harder on his head movement and foot work. He needed this fight. It showed him a lot of things. Things he should have already know but if he didn’t he def knows now. He knows he has to keep his right hand up when extending his arm to cut the distance. And when shooting his left/right hooks and jabs. He also had his first taste of a knock down which will def help. To take a punch and when under pressure to stay calm. He also did really well adapting in the fight and saw his flaws. He saw how he had his hands down and to not go crazy. This kid is only going to get better and better. And if he stays humble and disciplined. We got a real problem and one of the best boxers to ever step in the ring.
Liver shot hopkins vs de la hoya shi
I know that liver shot sent shockwaves through his knees. This fight was entertaining.
If Gervonta landed that punch Ryan woulda been asleep
Love that long arms kid
Young Ryan Garcia needs to use more angles to go with his quick hands right now he stands to square up
Can We All Just Appreciate DAZN For Not Telling Us Who Won In The Title? Because I Watched The Highlights Without Knowing Who Came Out Victorious 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Next Mike Tyson?
Them Brits need to stay on their side of the pond, unless they are heavyweights.
Garcia keeps his chin up to much and for someone who keeps calling out gervonta davis he better learn better defense cuz davis is too fast and hits too hard to be lax on d. You will just get starched.
After 1st knockdown, reporter switches real quick.
Ryan so Cocky he deserves it
Great fight from both opponents 🇲🇽💪🏽
Ryan Im glad to tell you you aint ready for Tank
I didn buy into the hype before... but man ryan garcia does really have that elite speed
Ryan needs to learn from this fight and start working on his head movement because if that punch was coming from tank i dont think he wouldve got up but this kid has heart🇲🇽🔥
@ 2:38 ........... EXPOSED !!!!!!
Boxing is alive and well.   Great fight.
Bro, Ryan, tell your corner to show how foot work with a south. I saw that in any moment you were not doing nothing. Humble opinion
Ryan Garcia reminds me of a young Amir Khan!  I hope he can take a better shot.
Did you guys catch what Ryan’s best punches are?
Ryan needs to protect his face more just like canelo, he has potential.
Luke is a hella of a fighter props to him🔥
The crowd was shocked! Check my channel i was there live
ryan got sent down😂😂😂😂
Hit em with that Canelo special
If Ryan Garcia fight Tank like he fought Campbell he will get KO'd. That is what it is.
U could see Ryan try to land a hook just like he did to fonseca 1:15
Lucky , luke doesn't have the strong power
Liver just left the chat
This making me wanna start boxing 🥊
Everyone smells Blood Tank Haney know they can floor this kid
No wayyy i wasn’t expecting that nockkk outttt from the other guy😱😱😱😱😱😱
We all know Tank will school this kid Garcia as soon as the second round.
Slow feet don't eat. Ryan's gotta start working more on his foot movement.
I hate when trainer's wrap gloves with the same color as the glove.
Cruz chin was tested far more slim better work on his defense...
Garcia hit the perfect shot to the liver knocking the wind out of Campbell causing him to go down
Is there anything better in combat sports than a liver shot to finish a fight?  The reaction is always a few seconds after the hit.  It's almost like the brain needs time to register the fact that the body is about to go limp.
ryan is the real deal🙌🏾
Bro Ryan got up from that knock out and won the fight wow 👏
Just the aztek blood on him did the job done. 👍
I respect both fighters very much but I was rooting for Garcia and boy am I glad he finally proved to the haters that he can last a while
Ryan Garcia knocked down 2 round
I love watching Ryan. He’s undefeated but unlike Mayweather this kid is actually taking risk and going for the knock out. I’ve been telling this from the beginning that this kid will be the next undefeated super star.
Garcia's lack of head movement will end up losing for him against top fighters.
Come on you gotta give the kid his respect now, to get up off the canvas like that and to come back and K-O cambell like that WOW!!! Promoters Get that money ready for king Ryan cuz his stock just went up!!!
That liver shot is sick and he knew it👊🏽 great fight Garcia👊🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Didn’t seem like ryan hit him that hard...
Eddy doesn’t get enough credit for calming down Ryan after he got knocked down
Ryan too flat footed
Ryan needs to build up his legs and work on his footwork
That hook was nasssss T
Faze rug could of handled that😞 body shot
What a fight. 2021 is off to a fast start.. the fans won tonight 🥊💪🏼
Canelo and Eddie are about to polish Garcia up!! De La Hoya and  the rest of the game are in trouble!!!
That body liver shot is gonna leave a Mexican scar.
Tank would ko Ryan
NOT READY FOR TANK 😑
Imagine cáñelo hit Campbell with that body punch
Tank would sleep this kid...
2:40 is what you’ll came for!
Garcia needed a fight like this...to be challenged...to see if he could face adversity.  He handled that knockdown well, didn't panic and stuck to the game plan. The experience learned from this fight will help him a lot as he faces stiffer competition in the future.
Glass yaw
Ryan Said Get back Gang
Looks like Luke Campbell wasn’t ready for the body shot challenge.
bruh! i think if punch would have landed 4:03 . Luke's head would get ripped from his body.
Listen Up in boxing 🥊🙄🥊 what U don't do is walk backwards Danger hit 🎯 move Especially a guy with same arm Length great Show tho🥊😉🥊👍👈
Respect to Garcia. He came out aggressive, I like that
Garcia is only 22 and still raw, and wants to fight the top guys.
Ryan is gonna smoke Davis
luke campbell,  he didn’t push the advantage to drop ryan,there’s a lot of time in that round
He is young, starting to get respect is boxing , on his way be CHAMP on all divisions. Canelo and de la hoya would teach him
Those body shot challenges really came in handy 😂
Tank would destroy this dude.
if it wasnt for canelo and his team he would have never won
Ryan is not read for big names. Bad defense. Okay chin. Offense is okay. No real power. Very similar to khan.
Them liver shots can really mess you up
We’re did they found this Uber driver for Garcia , De la Hoya need to get a better fighters
I'm scared that chin might be his weak point if it is I hope he doesnt end up like Khan
Ryan Garcia just got exposed he is not in the same category as a tank Davis now everyone is going to come after Ryan that chin is just as flimsy as khans chin
Garcia espero que con esa caída se te quite un poco lo arrogante y seas más humilde por que eres buen boxeador
Dammmmmm that body shot was so precise ouchhhh my liver. GG let's go ryan
Ryan Garcia needs to work on his defense
Ryan has a decent chin/poker face. He was badly hurt and kept his cool. Kept his legs. Eventually found the KO. He will only get better. From my opinion as a guy that has sparred and trained and been in a few corners he needs to work on clinching and also keep his hands up if he's too stiff to move his head. He drops his hands canelo style but doesn't move his head like Canelo. He can improve.
Tank hits Garcia with that punch and there’s no getting up.....FACT !!
Bro that body shot didn't even look like it hurt that bad at first
Ryan is a great prospect great fight 👍
bro he wont be able to beat haney fighting like that..
Super punch 🤜!!!
Tank would destroy this Kid
That's how u deal with adversity
He gotta work on his defense tho. That's his age, size n confidence that's allowing him to fight that way but it won't last much longer especially with heavy hitters like tank or even Haney. ZERO chance when he goes up in weight. He gets hit too much. But he has everything you need that can't be taught n what Hes lacking, he's got the right coaches that'll fix it. But kinda needs to start asap! Imho.
I like how canelo is there
Obviously Garcia has been taking notes on how Canelo knocks guys out with that liver gut shot . That was just a sneaky , quick , viscious punch by Garcia . 🙄🤔👀👁💥🙊🙉🙈🤑😜😁😵😬👌🔥😳
Young Ryan needs improvement in his defense.  He is too eager...uses power shots way too much instead of picking his shots.  At his tender boxing age it is understandable.   Luke definitely exposed his holes.  If he gets knocked down like that by a bigger puncher he may not get up.  Ry does have skills tho.  He simply needs more polishing.  He has the reach and height to box beautifully on the outside.  Hopefully he can learn to use his jab to keep his opponents at bay and in control.  It's difficult to win fights simply on aggressive pressure.  He does this because he thinks he has to.  He hasn't figured out his true style identity.  However, he proved he has a chin and can come back from adversity.   Luke is a solid fighter...no push over.  Hard won victory.
Ryan proved himself tonight getting off the deck to come back and finish Campbell, and yes he can take a punch and then some!
This is why I don’t do pay per view, thank you you tube
Ryans combo at 4:48 is 🔥
Luke flushed red after the stinging body blow. Ryan put him in horrific unsettlement. Respect both for stepping into the dangerous ring and putting reputation on the line.
Ryan left himself open a lot
Hey still not ready for Davis
Y’all tough ryan was over 🤣 he aint neva finna lose
I have never seen Ryan Garcia go down like that but ey he won tho respect to both they are such great fighters.
Ryan Garcia isn't a real boxer. Camps like mikey Garcia camps have said it before, Ryan is just Instagram famous but he will never be one of the best. Lots of amateurs have speed like Ryan many are even faster but the ring is something different
scared me when i saw ryan fall like that , he couldn’t stop himself from falling ,  can’t wait to see what the young man has to come
GARCIA KAYO REDONDITO.....DIJO MI ABUELO.......PARESE AMIR KAHN
That’s crazy man Ryan on his streak
Gracia fell like a b**th🔥🤪🤣😂😅🤭🙌
I am  Garcia fan however,  I am glad he got putt on his behind. He should learn humility. Great fight nevertheless.
Over a million views
If he fell from that punch then I don't even want to see tank hit him
That liver punch doesn’t play around. If timed and placed right it can take someone out of the fight as easy as a headshot.
And he thinks he can beat tank Davis please!
Look, I think Ryan García has been proving people wrong and he’s a much better fighter than most people think, but I don’t know if he should be calling out Gervonta Davis like that
Ryan Garcia has Mexican blood... thats it I said it, he just has that blood.
campbell doesnt smell blood
Floyd in the making
ryan garcia, was really a warrior dude.. that was a really hard punch but he got up easily
Ryan garcia is bullshet
Great learning experience for Ryan.
As much as i dont like garcia respect to both boxers, but after watching this fight garcias gonna need to improve more if he wants Tank, Tank would of left this fight with a KO, what ryan should be chasing after is haney
Davis will Win if he fought this guy 😂😂
Ryan is too reckless. He will get exposed by top tier boxers.
Rigged fight that judge even had the score card rigged
Rayan Garcia is still a joke and will always be a joke at boxing 😂
Props to luke though he put in work
LLLEETTTSSSSS GOOOOOOOO RYAN
That body shot jeez
Bruh that body punch didnt seem like much until I saw the slow mo
Garcia took his best shot and came back....kids special
Beautiful
Garica will lose against elite fighters. No way can he handle Tank Davis or Haney.
Ryan needs to stop extending his arms
2:30 & 7:10
Wow I'm Done
Tank will knock him out he ain't ready
He needs to move his feet and head plus he needs to learn how to keep his lead foot outside of the southpaw's right foot when he punches
sticks his head straight up, no head movement, goes backward in a straight line, puts his foot inside the south paws right lead foot...I was hoping Garcia was better but me thinks he gets whacked out by Davis, Lopez..
Where all them "luke gonna ko this guy out" at 🤔🤔🤔 sure deleted them pretty fast 🤣
Not ready for the big leagues yet
Who else jaw dropped when ryan got knocked down
He will be ready for tank or teofimo in 2-3 years but not anytime soon.. another warm up fight and then Haney to test himself before fighting some lions
That body shot look like something cracked or broke or shattered OUCH!!! Congrats Ryan Garcia!!!!
I’m on the Band Wagon, matter of fact I’m the lead singer. Ryan Garcia is unbelievably special. Luke Campbell is a great fighter. It’s destiny. Idk. Boxing is amazing right now and I’m glad to be a part of it. So much talent and money being made. Tank vs Ryan. That’s legendary. I’m not sure Ryan is ready but he’s calling for it. Even Ryan vs Haney. I think Ryan has a better chance vs Haney. Tank is special. And is only Getting stronger. Tank submitted Leo Santa Cruz in the corner of the ring. He’s relentless and so strong. He broke down Leo. Leo was a warrior and went out like a man who demands nothing less than my admiration. Tank did his thing. We have to see who can absorb whose power the best, Tank vs KingRyan. Who will be most prepared to sustain til the last second. BOXING IS SPECIAL RIGHT NOW
I felt that body shot... 😳😬😫😮
Im not gonna Lie, my Jaw Drop when Ryan Garcia went Down for a Littlebit but Ryan Garcia is a Great Fighter hands down
I was impressed by how ryan handled the knock down
Ryan is one dimensional.
Props to Ryan for gettin up and pushing it through.  Shows he got heart.  That body blow was wicked.
Garcias wack i expected way more how u let luke drop u😄 over hype
bro i have never seen a man go down on his knees from a body shot. mans kidney's prolly failed instantly
Luke campbell looks like a crossbow man from a castle .....lol
That body shot buckled my legs also.
😂😂😂😂 kick out
Everyone commenting about Ryan’s knock down. Paquiao is still one of the best in the world and got knocked out cold by Marquez......
Imagine if tank would if had hit hi. Like that it would of been nite nite for him 💤 😴 💤 😴
so after his win, did Ryan go home to his baby mama or his sidechick Malu? 😂
This guy is calling out Tank hah! You ain't ready
This kid has the hands to beat Tank. If he improves his head movement and sharpens up his footwork, Tank is in for a long night.
Let's be honest. Ryan can't beat LSC. Gervonta davis sleeps ryan. His chin was finally tested and we now know he can't take a punch. Gorvonta will just wait for a big punch like he did with leo.
Idk i think ryan should wait a little before going after tank hes gonna get put to sleep
Stopped watching after Ryan hit the mat.
Great fight Ryan Garcia showed the heart of a champion. Tank would stop Ryan by the sixth round in opinion.
Still not convinced
Has your appendix burst yet? Garcia: Now it has.
Dejaste los pelos en la serca ganaste de pansaso Ryan no boxseas nada nomas estas esperando para tirar nada de boxseo ya Vegas vesaste la lona de hai paradelante te van a tumbar no duras mucho tienes el mismo tips de el delaoya oportunista nomas es mi opinion y critica
that liver shot shuts down the body. And the body starts leaking! He would habe been better off eating taco bell
Garcia still sticking it to his critics. He hit Campbell harder than Lo did.
Its okay Ryan, most people talk trash about Pacman when first arrived.. Look at him now. Hopefully they gain your respect
Now we know Garcia can take a punch and how he would respond after being knocked down. The way he fell I wasnt sure if  he was going to get up but he got right back up
Ryan not ready for Tank yet..period
Ryan better step his game up big time if he wants to fight Tank Davis. If that would have been Tank hitting him like that in the first round, it would have been NITE NITE!!! I like Ryan but he has alot of holes in his defense.
Ryan Garcia is vicious, at the same time campbell's drop of garcia early In the fight was a classic chin check 😂 lol
Garcia is a great offensive fighter.  His chin will eventually fail him against top fighters who will be able to handle his speed & power
That hook to the body reminded me of Roy Jones Jr.'s shot on Virgil Hill... Y'all musta forgot!!!
garcia needs to improve his D, his offense is amazing
He should have hit campbell with a right right before him taking a knee and put his lights out
As much as I don’t like tank, Garcia is not ready for him. Tank would eat him. Too tough.
I love that they post highlights right away after fights
Those shots well make it feel like you got baby feet
He ain't ready for Tank Davis!!! Haney  easy win for Garcia for sure!!!
I knew he was gonna get caught he opens up too much & doesn't move his head just needs to tighten up his defense but he showed heart, if he can fix those small flaws I see him competing against top opponents, too soon to tell ....
defanse , defense  ,  ask Canelo how  .
Campbell needs a liver transplant.
This is the guy that wants to fight Pac. Lol. He must want to retire with Manny. Specially getting caught like that by a B tier fighter.
Now we all know Ryan has a glass chin 🙄
I know for a fact Ryan Garcia learned that liver shot from Canelo😌
Did he just get sat down ??
He not ready for Tank or Haney
I was shocked when I saw Ryan get knocked out, it felt unreal
Ryan would get knocked out by Skakur Stevenson
He want get up from the tank
Yea tell him go against Devin
Garcia's chin is not world class though better work that sheep neck out. Looks weak. Imagine fighting loma Davis or lopez
Why are you people commenting “he” as if we know who exactly that is
Es basura 🗑
This kid is fast, but he aint got no head movement whatsoever. Zero head movement
This is the moment Ryan went through the fire and knows how to get back up!!!!
Cambell wasn’t aggressive enough :/
Evolution
Garcia is not ready for the top 3 at 135..... He's to flat footed and he needs to work on his defense.
Ryan doesn't look ready for the big ones no foot work no head movement
Where are the dudes saying Campbell will put Garcia away?
Best game ever
If you notice Ryan telegraphs his lefthook.
That power from Ryan Garcia thooo!! he shouldn’t of got knock down too. But theirs his over aggression & being young. He responded very well after that.
I hate rg
Garcia broke Campbell's liver.
I was shocked when Ryan got knocked down
Loving dazn highlights... so canelo was basically giving out instructions from the sidelines..lol beast af
Great fight I want to see more head movement from Ryan Garcia
Tank is way better than him and it's a difference when you had to box and when you're a fortunate individual that chose to box, he's not ready for the type of conviction that some of these brothas will fight with!
So like when is him and gervonta fighting?😭😭
Ryan needs Freddie Roach if he to be untouchable...
He's not ready for tank, to many holes in his game to fight the power puncher in my opinion. He leaves his head in a bad position while his hands are up around his face a lot.
i remember that everyone was saying that ryan was gonna loose, and then he won and you guys still mad lol.
Luke Campbell looked better in this fight to me. They made it seem as though Garcia knocked Campbell out cold. Garcia is not going to beat Tank, Spence or Bud if he ever moved up in weight.
Jake Paul seriously wants to fight this guy? He has a death wish then.
- Ryan Garcia is nothing to worry about simply has no style ..
remember when everyone said Ryan Garcia was going to lose?
I've always said Ryan is a great fighter but his head is kinda small , He's all body in the weight class . Luke Campbell did a great job setting that shot up but I am sure if Ryan gets hit by the big hitters in the weight class he is going out . I like him a lot I hope he improved his defense because I believe that will be his down fall.
RYAN GARCIA, IS ON HIS WAY! VERY IMPRESSIVE WIN AND HE DEMONSTRATED THE INTESTINAL FORTITUDE IT TAKES TO BE CHAMPION. 1
Ion know why these folks keep clowning him....bruh ain’t nun to play with😬
That punch moved every organ in his body 🤯
If Garcia thinks his chin can handle a clean shot from Tank.....well we all know how that would work out for Garcia!lol
He ain’t beating tank
He’s scared of tank
Garcia showed it's in him,not on him!!!salute my boi🔥🔥🔥
If Luke can drop him y’all certainly know TANK will definitely TKO HIM WITH NO PROBLEM
Told you this kid is the real deal, Davis, Haney ,Lopez, will not be able to stop him, Berchellt maybe, but i doubt it.
He still don't look ready. Footwork and head movement lacking. But congratulations to Ryan on the win! Him getting back up and finishing like that showed tremendous heart!
Now it’s on to the next
the ref didn't even count to 10 or even ask campbell if he still wanted to fight
He should’ve rushed Garcia when he knocked him down
ironically the shot he was training with the world. beautiful actually.
That was a mean body shot!
Tank gone knock buddy out.
He faced adversity.. end up fueling the fire 🔥
he took it personal and won
Ryan has great hands, speed and power. His footwork and defense are still not there. He has to quickly work on these 2 aspects to dominate the division.
That body punch made me. Want too go use the Restroom🤣😂😂👍
Garcia can’t get away with throwing that flat footed squared stance lunging body shot with Lopez or Haney.. ..he needs to work on his defense as well. Im a fan of him though and i hope he takes this fight as a learning experience. He should go far with Canelo in the gym with him.
He needs that head movement canelo has, when he sees a hard punch coming to his face he always moves into it to prevent being knocked.
Garcia’s body blows are nothing to play around with. Fighters are going to be nervous about getting in the ring with him now... Head shots definitely hurt, but not like a brick to the liver🧐
Garcia has developed into something better than i thought he would be. Legit contender now.
Ryan is amazing, great talent. But he still need to improve some stuff like covering his face more, he lets it wide open and thats why he went down. Also throw more body shots instead of going only for the head
If Ryan Garcia fights Tank he won’t get back up
RYAN SHOCKED THE WORLD
That's not Luke Campbell
Most dont get up from a punch like that, he got up quick
Props to Garcia for eating that hook & coming back. Finally someone that competed with him
I surprise he got up from that liver shot own his owned 😂😂😂
since the charlo fight, a couple big fights after ended with a body shot seems rig
Dude almost lost against a scrub put him in the ring with a man and I bet he gets bullied him and canelo are losers!
Beautiful fight 👏 🥲💯🔥💪
There’s better competition out there Garcia is a strong puncher he has so much potential but he needs to work on his head movement and defense that’s what he needs to work on the most he just got hit by a slow powerful puncher what gonna happen if he fights a fast powerful fighter he could get knocked out  but I still believe Garcia is going to be  the next big thing
🇲🇽 💩💩💩
people who are saying he has a glass chin are smoking bruh... he got hit flush with a full force of a left hook from A southpaw and got up like nothing happened
Too bad Garcia didn’t fight a reflex bag
Ryan wanted ALLLLLL THE SMOKE
🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Garcia won but was exposed
7:12 wow
Congratulations Ryan Garcia 👏 and all the fighters dat won today
He got money AND clapped by his coach after, win win situation
Aka canelo signature!!!
If I had to be honest Ryan gracia is a B level fighter don’t believe the hype
I'm happy for Ryan, some people may still have doubts about his legitimacy but he is still young and with this win he is on his way
No way he beats Tank. Garcia defense and head movement needs work.
Then Ryan and molested by his corner after the KO
Unfortunately this fight  makes me think  Gervonta Davis or TheofimoLopez would knock out cold Ryan Garcia in 3 rounds max.
Btw who won the fight? I nvr watch it?
I am seeing Ryan stepping on his opponents foot so they can’t move and he can knockdown out is that legal? 1:37
Shows how much he’s learned training with canelo it’s kinda scary
They cherry picked Luke, Ryan gets dropped in the 2nd, comes back to win it, and straight acts like he conquered the world, calm down dude, its Luke Campbell, you cherry picked him for a reason. Ryan got exposed, Haney and Tank will finish what Luke couldn't.
That knockdown in round 2 is only fuel to the fire he’s gonna unleash on the next opponent. Big ups to Ryan man. Now give him his respect.
Congrats to Ryan and props to Luke for getting that hook. Great match for both boxers.
That puch to the liver
Looks like ESPN is writing Lomachenko off already.
This made me realize tank would whoop him
Campbell didnt want to fight..different guy then who lomachenko fought
Tank will punish this kid , he isn’t ready
✌🏾🙏🏾🐜Team Garcia🙏🏾✌🏾🐜Team Campbell✌🏾🙏🏾🐜
He needs to tuck in that chin.. He's wide open for an uppercut.
Garcia's lucky barely got through this one
Que cosa tan Grande por favor que mierda este es el futuro de el boxeo cuánto le dieron a este hombre para el que perdiera
Ryan showed true heart but if you think hes beating tank your crazy.. all that speed aint gone matter when you get hit with that mac truck.. plus yall act like floyd aint training tank
For Campbell part he didn’t press hard after that drop which allow Garcia to recover
Instantly put his hands up after that knockdown 🤣 great way to stay composed tho!
He said he want Davis. I don’t think so man.
I think cambell kO on Garcia shocked him that’s why he fell.. if he was hurt he would be wobbly , got right up
Garcia has his chin in the air too high.he will get kod soon
This foo never went body’s in middle school and it shows
He just compared Garcia to Oscar de la Hoya tho...
for everyone who wants to see the KO here, 7:10
Body shot KO's have to be the most satisfying thing for a boxer. Your opponent is still conscious but their body, thus their will is finished.
Who doing the body shot challenge now?
Ryan Garcia took that punch, but needs to move that head. Gervonta Davis will put him to sleep
King Ryan
Age gap is unfair! Put garcia in with a young Campbell and he's finished. I'ma keep saying this; Gracia is ALL SHOW. He needs to fight more boxers of his caliber.
Garcia. Vs teofimo or tank gonna be epic
He hasn't fought any top quality fighters, his is coming. Remember always  sombody out there better than you youngster
That count was pretty quick lol
He’s not ready for tank simple
he has some philly shell that canelo does sometimes. I like that he has one of this hand out to measure distance and guard the opponent's head when he's in trouble but that results in a hook to the chin. boxing is tough.
2:38
he definitely not ready for tank,Loma or Haney!
Cambell got that jelly stomach garcia got that glass chin🤣🤣🤣🤣😂
The GOAT came to watch his son
if that’s tank it’s not a knockdown is a knockout lol
Looking for the knockout 7:14
Gervontae Davis would wipe the floor with this kid😭😭😭😭😭
Gracia is the real deal! Garcia and Teofimo have the best resumes at lightweight.
Haters will continue to discredit the man but today he showed he can still come out on top even after a knockdown!
What is impressive is that Ryan would’ve still won if he continued the way he fought through twelve. The liver shot was just an even sweeter win!!
Tank is a different animal though
That liver shot was life threatening🤯
Ryan needs to stay away from Tank he's going to sleep for sure
Commentators are trash, this is why I miss HBO so much
that liver shot in slo mo made me wince bruh ik that hurt
Ryan is doo doo 🤣😂
Ryan blew the air out of him and Lukecampbell thought the blow was going to the face. What a clever blow.
He not ready for tank
Don’t let tank catch him if they fight
If Ryan landed that earlier in round 5 the fight woulda been over
Two dorks in the ring with no style!! Lolz
Ryan looked like he had concrete shoes.
Campbell should have never let up...
I give him props for knocking down Garcia
Garcia is another great MEXICAN FIGHTERHE CAN TAKE A PUNCH 🥊 FOR HIS SIZE
Imagine this fight on hbo 😔
Campbells not a great fighter. Garcia's too emotional. A great fighter will tear him up.
bogbog to pag linabanan nya si Pac-Man 😪
He don't want dat Tank smoke. He will not get up from tanks left! Facts!!!!!!
Garcia hurt campbell in 5 round people forgetting.. and Luke is one of top contenders I'm proud of young dude .. that being said tank need a top contender also lopez vs tank
He's not ready for Haney Or Tank or Teo lopez
Better for Ryan to get hit now then go against tank and get destroyed
I knew garcia was gonna win👺, most of y’all saying campbell was going to win😂💀
Boring fight
Bro all his knockouts look like regular punches or not so bad but because he so fast you have to catch it in slow more like duno
This kid better learn the importance of using and defending against a jab. If not its only a matter of time before gets an L.
Ese es un guerrero García para el mundo viva México Bendiciones de parte de un Dominicano.
Ryan came out too cocky and not humble.   Dude got served a humble meal #3.   Keep your hands up man.
Believe that
Ryan Garcia is the greatest fighter alive
He needed that knockdown!
If Davis hits the same punch that Campbell hit on Ryan. Ryan’s done
Que madrazo le acomodo al higado!,
Bro hopefully Garcia doesn’t become another Amir Khan 😔
That's how you know Ryan isn't ready for tank he doesn't deserve to be up their yet
That body shot was vicious.
Ryan is not ready to be call the  “greater boxer” not even close his opponent was way below to be a challenging for him and even that low quality make him touch the rim. :(
Can’t wait till tank cracks that jaw.
The Canelo body shot 😳
He remind of Edwin Valero, he would have his chin up in the air
we need  Gervonte vs Garcia ALREADDYYY😭😭😭
That’s Canelo’s move
Clean win . Congrats to the Garcia team 💯
I think Garcia is overrated but... I have to give respect to the young boy! I'm waiting for his fight against Tank, if he can get past Davis then, I will respect the young man as a top boxer.
Great fight by both fighters. Garcia definitely showed ❤ but his Defense will have to be better to fight other Champions.
Ryan getting knocked down shocked me too
This kid is on fire keep up G !!!!
I want to see a fight with Jorge Linares next..
If garcia falling off that hit he don't stand a chance with tank
Man this was a poor show from Garcia his foot was not n the inside of his opponent which left him  open to the left hand and he was lacking head movement but I’m glad he pulled through.
Meh
those liver shots will incapacitate you.. quickly too 🤕
Fixed fight
Ryan’s a beast
DAYUMMM!!!  That body shot was off the hook, I'm guessing 700-800 POUNDS OF FORCE IN THAT  PUNCH!!  👊 👊
His feet are flat all the time... What’s up with his legs, gotta do more dance.
He’s not yet ready. Easy work by haney and tank
Wow..that campbell punch that almost got Garcia  destroyed  was more impressive than garcias win.
Garcia acting like he just beat Gervonta, or Teofimo 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Bro. You beat Campbell. No one expected Campbell to win.
Flat foot 🤣🤣
Pero ve pero bien también que hayan tumbado al García para que se le quite lo fanfarrón
That chin sus
Freaking badass. King Ryan with that hook as always 🔥
Dope fight...is it me kr does Garcia have no footwork?
Lopez and Davis knock out Garcia inside of 8 rounds easy today showed his heart but he’s to flat footed and can’t take a big punch to be in there against Lopez and Davis.
A better south paw than Campbell can defete ryan.
Garcia is giving Amir Khan competition for the glass jaw king
Liver punch
Mexican blood 🩸 bravo Bryan
I’ve said it in a different video, if Ryan doesn’t lift his right hand to cover his face when practicing throwing his hook, jab, etc. he is going to form a bad habit. And that’s is exactly what happened. I liked how he fought the first round, he was looking a bit like Canelo, but when he got scared he went back to the same old fighting style and had no defense or movement.
Garcia has  0.0 head movement. I'm pretty sure this is going to become a problem sooner or later in his career. Probably a lot soon than later.  Another over hyped Golden Boy fighter.
Ryan Garcia is fkn garbage. Sloppy footwork.  Would get knocked out by Tank Davis within 4 rounds
He did it wow. He was boooom’d hard in the 2nd. Great job
Great knockout, but Ryan’s gonna have to start moving his head if he wants tank.
Great performance, but That interview was cringe af 😖
I think that guy rib broke i played it in slow motion I was that ribs I feel bad for him Sheesh😫
Ese mocoso no la arma!! Nada no sirve para nada le echan puro viejo que ya mero lo deja en la lona par que sele quite lo arrogante!!
This was  lot more exciting than I expected it to be
The Ryan hate in these comments are so cringe.
Great fight
Let talk about the fact how he responded to the knockdown 2:39
Canelo Jr right hete
And props for Luke Campbell taking that Liver shot like a champ and getting back up just a few seconds later
This fight proved he isn’t ready to fight tank just yet humble yourself kid. Way to get back In the fight tho respect took his first knock down like a champ 💯
He got caught now everyone is predicting his downfall. No fighter is unbeatable. Its how you respond when you get knocked down that builds the heart of a champion. Garcia showed me something tonight.
Only slow motion could do justice to that punch
Garcia's overly aggressive strategy paid off but not without risk as he finally tastes the canvas for the first time in his career, needs to cover up, the hands always coming down.
Canelo taught him that body shot
He's honestly not fighting anyone. I understand why Hoya is protecting him and padding that record but too much hype
Great fight and a great test for Ryan, he definitely passed it successfully
Luke Campbell looked like a fighter who was being held back as if that left hook was a mistake. Instead of becoming the aggressor he became a sparing partner punching bag for Ryan Garcia.  One thing for sure Ryan is not ready for the big-boy fights flat footed no defense all hype.  Takeover, Tank, Haney and Loma would send him home crying.
Teofimo would own Garcia and Tank could hurt him bad.
What if that was Tank that rocked him?....hmm, the million dollar question. What's your answer?
Like is you put the video in slowmo to see Ryan Garcia's hands
Ryan Garcia wow he is going up stages
You can see how much heart Ryan has at the end of the vid
Ryan needs to protect that pretty face.. Luke just painted the blueprint for future opponents.
Genius boxer - Ryan Garcia
He won but does not change the fact that he got knocked the f*** out
Nasty body shot!!
he never gonna beat tank tho
Did he just play shadow boxing with him and mimick Ryans gut check hook on him coodles to blue shorts
Otro fraude
Congratulation you just watched the most rigged fight of the year already! All Campbell had to do was throw a consistent jab in this kids face and it would have been game over, instead Campell chose to take a dive... yeah Garcia quick, but big deal the “G” in Garcia stands for a Glass chin...  Just another phony big money is promoting...  Shame on professional Boxing and Oscar de la Renta... yeah that was a slight...
Did know one else just see that slight Giotenne choke Ryan had him in for a sec there 👀 that was extremely dangerous and should have been counted as cheating in my book
Campbell could have finished it man. Gave him room to breath after that knock down man
Hes amir khan jr watch
This kid is not ready for tank
Does he get up if Tank hits him with that left though? That being said, I can respect the heart he has.
That was Canelo's body shot, he taught that body shot to Garcia
Garcia had a hard time with Luke i don't blame tank for not fighting Ryan yet, this dude need to step his game a couple notches..
I'll say it since no one else will . If that was a left from tank he not gettin up. He was asleep til he hit the ground.
that was a nasty body shot
That’s the downside of being a southpaw, the liver is on the lead side and an easier target.
Alright haters let’s hear it.
I like how Ryan uses canelos tips and mives
this fight tells me that garcia ain't nothin. campbell almost done him in and could have finished if he didn't catch covid19. i had it myself and instantly, my stamina was cut by more than a half  (could fight 10 rounds stamina wise at a very intense pace and came back struggling to finish 5 light bag rounds. it took at least 2 months before i could even truly start to begin to build myself back up). now keep in mind that pre-covid campbell was considered a step up.  even then,  he was considered by most to be past it. campbell, while wisely not getting careless, didn't fully capitalise on the knockdown. that knockdown came early on in the fight too. sure, you could write it off as a consequence of a fight... but i truly believe it was an experienced proper fighter who saw holes in garcia's fight plan but lacked the stamina to execute. when campbell took the liver shot... his hands were down and he was gassed. ryan won't survive teofimo lopez or devin haney. i can't really tell with davis. his ring iq seems low.
Campbell should have just rushed him after that knockdown. That was a legit knockdown. Garcia didn’t know where he was.
That Body Shot Hit like COVID hit the USA !
Great fight from both guys. I think Ryan and his team needed this experience moving forward to face the elite of his weight class. Hopefully he works on his defense to say the least.
Can someone compare Ryan’s skill level to a ufc fighter? I don’t watch boxing but interested to see if he’s elite or upcoming, or facing weak comp or wherever he’s at
LETS GO RYAN!!!
Telling you now tank is a different breed!!! Ryan can’t take the power
Happy he got knocked down, ever happier that he won lol
go ryan
This fight is proof that Garcia isn't ready to fight Haney or Shakur  .Ryan's greatest weakness is his lazy footwork. Haney and Shakur both have phenomenal footwork.
Ryan's celebration was a bit over the top ya
With tanks power he’s easily knocking Ryan out
Despite Campbell suffered from his previous illness covid still managed to knockdown ryan with a clean left hook to his chin but a comeback from ryan he knocked out campbell in round 7 with a left hook through his body liver that he couldn't get up i was expecting campbell will get up but he can't hold it anymore he couldn't breathe properly that time yeah covid is a serious problem it really affects ur lungs and your breathing in my opinion i think campbell still didn't recover from covid 100% honestly ryan did a great job there still managed to win ryan garcia for future hall of famer in boxing
Love Ryan’s hand speed and power. The boxing is hit and don’t get hit. And if he wants to beat Davis he needs to stay on his toes and more head movement. He doesn’t get up if that left is Tanks.
Garcia really has a lot of room to improve, which is a scary thing for anybody around his weight.
That got his respect
The problem with the non boxing fan is seen in this forum. Nothing more than people who live through other people. Garcia has not shown that he can beat a Devin Haney. His advantage over Tank is his height. He is taller than Haney, but haney will adjust better then Tank. Garcia will do well as long as he can keep people outside and batter then that way. Bandwagon jumpers are the worst. Put on gloves and stop typing.
The Canelo special
He better watch out for Davis.  Garcia is lucky Campbell let him recover
They owe the editor a FAT raise 😂
Ryan's going to get slept by Tank
ryan fell nasty, he had no legs or arms
I just started boxing last August. Life changing for sure. Helped me get sober.
Ryan Garcia just proved today he will not go too far in boxing, with a bad defense and worst of all he has a weak jaw.
Ryan surprisingly got up fast and bounced back in and kept moving forward
Way to get back up bud!
Respect to his coaches because even if Ryan is a great boxer , they know he ain’t ready for Davis !!!!
If this was 2020 it would have been a contender for fight of the year.
si se fijan en la pelea campbell suve muchos los brazos y descuida el cuerpo
5:10 saved by the bell 😂
Stop early
Make Loma Vs. Garcia !!
Garcia you are WORTHY
Does age matter on boxing?
Soo fast he teleported
I knew Ryan Garcia was gonna win and knew it was gonna go 4-7 rounds, but didn’t know he was gonna get knocked down. Ryan is no joke and hope him and Devin Haney fight to prepare him for Tank Davis! Davis is a beast and can beat Ryan! Ryan is getting better every fight and hope he wins🇲🇽
That a  real García
It’s always hard I’m proud of him it’s no easy he won this time but it’s ok to lose sometimes I’m not wishing him or anybody something bad I’m just saying if u go down it’s a learning experience and u can get up and become stronger🙌🏼👍🏼 work hard for ur dreams guys everything is possible nothing is impossible
Big props to 2 talents. Luke dropped Ryan Garcia for the first time, and RG stopped Luke Campbell for the first time!
This proves Ryan is running away from Mayweathers fighter 😂 got dropped by a nobody imagine what tank would do....
Hopefully Garcia learned something after being down first time only get tougher from here on after beating an Olympian fighter
Earned a lot of respect for Garcia in this fight.
Keep this editor
All those body shot challenges paid off, what a fight 🤩🤟🏻
Very Talented kid, now has something to work on.  he needs to stop being so flat footed. He is gotta move around more and be a more shifty and unpredictable. Or else he will lose to a better fighter
Great fight for campbell at least he can brag about  being the first guy to knock out ryan garcia.. garcia it's fighting like a true mexican but doesn't have  the chin of a Mexican so with that being said start working on that foot work..
Mayweather lost a million bucks his on this fight bet against garcia
Ryan talk to much I'm a fan but his mouth got Adhd. I believe he should be more humble on his approach
Lol, wonder how much Golden Boy paid for that. Watched Luke Campbell against Lomachenko and Linares and I have to say, he held back and fought at Garcia speed, just sayin
Garcia fought outside Campbells lead foot ALL night. That’s why he had a tough time. That’s why he was dropped. I didn’t hear corner telling him to stay outside the lead foot and move to his left which was just as surprising.
Let’s go Ryan!
Hopefully he learns from being dropped. Needs to work on his defense.
A better fighter would've finished Garcia.
Yawwwnnnn. Gervonta in 7
Let's see how that lazy jab does against tank . He's gonna get knocked out.
Great showing youngsuperstar
Garcia fighting Campell who coming off two losses, when is he fighting someone with a winning streak like himself?
Viva México.that a Warriors
Tbh I just wish Ryan would stop relying on his speed and power so much.
Tank will put him in his place
I’m happy to see the king face the canvas get up and still show who he really is. Great showing
We like méxicanos .because
DAZN really pushes boxing forward. Thanks for being not too greedy, awesome translations, and prompt highlights postings.
I still can’t believe that Campbell dropped him I can’t wait for devin Haney v Ryan garcia
Please Ryan reconsider the tank fight
Annoying, dude has zero head movement, sooner or later he's going to get kod hard
Kid might be on to something.
He's not ready for tank
Im a fan of Garcia but he got exposed in this fight. He is not championship caliber and the chin is in question.
Ryan solo demostró que no está al nivel de Davis !! Gervonta lo duerme
I hope he never loses.
Of course He'll become a great fighter. He has attitude and power but still he has a lot to learn; he needs to get waist movement, faints, and improve his job. I'm sure this fight taught him a lot...
EL DINERO MUEVE TODO, PELEA COMPLETAMENTE ARREGLADA!!!
they had us in the first half
Boxing is human cruelty! Banned this sport please!
i’ve never seen someone get knocked out and stand up that quick. Shows the kid wanted it
Some of yall really mad hatin on garcia. Yeah he faced nobodies but as soon as he wanted yo face campbell its “garcia has no chance to beat him” and now that garcia won its “campbell isn’t elite”. Garcia is young so he is only going to get better.
Wow, I cant believe he's even a pro on t.v. this kid is even more garbage than I originally thought. Not athletic what so ever and not coordinated either. I saw him trip over his own feet. Cant wait to see him get humbled by the fighters that are actually talented. All his fans must be 12 yr old girls, cause I know known of them are real boxing fans.
1. Teofimo  2. Shakur 3. Tank 4. Haney 5. Ryan Garcia. Fun fights but this kid isn't world champion level yet. Needs more time w the Reynosos to work on head movement and to not fight so upright.
Lol all these boxing coaches in the comments....
And canelo never gets hurt or knocked down lol that’s how you know all his fights are rigged.
I just became a Ryan Garcia fan. Great work 🥊
Badass fight. Both tough fighters, props to both of them. Tank will eat Ryan Garcia
Canelo looks like a proud father
Ryans left hook in slow mo shook Campbell’s soul! I’m a big Garcia fan he just needs to tighten up on the defensive and keep those hands up. Overall he’s on his way forsure. Great fight!
Thats how you win like a champion. He took a shot right on the button and showed he was all heart after that. That is how you become great. Absolute respect to Campbell, he is not no scrub at all, that body shot was vicious. I could definitely see a rematch down the line.  Awesome fight!!!
Nasty footing, nasty footwork and the hands down super open,bad defenses  and foot work.
Ryan better not do that against Tank, after watching this just like Gervonta Davis said to Garcia to let him grow. Garcia has the potential to be special but if he fight Tank right now it might destroy him if he cant handle losing a fight. Because tank would had hurt garcia after watching this match. Campbell wasnt that special
Tank scared of Teofimo Lopez tho!! Facts over Feelings
BRYANT GARCÍA  REALLY NEED TO WORK ON HIS DEFENSE..
That’s crazy he Ryan with the exact same shirt 7:10
Ryan no esta listo para tank todavia  es bueno pero tiene k ser más inteligente tank lo  KO en el 7 rd
Everybody gonna get knock down
The last soldier
Noe gusta el estilo de García.. tiene algo que no se como explicar... Será un estiló muy simple. Sin emoción.
Looking at this for the 5th time, man what a bad footing  from Ryan Garcia, he won on an impressive way no doubt  , but nasty  nasty skill, bad footing specially  on the 6th round.
After this KD leave little questions to answer !... the kid is legit and next superstar
Idk that fight was mad SUS! 🤔
Lowkey trash. Gervonta would hurt that boa
Ryan, keep that right foot planted when throwing that right hand baby !
I rather him get more hype to see him get blown up 2nd round was just a taste more to come in the future. Luke doesnt even have heavy hands either
Ryan’s just showed he’s the real deal now. Not only did he get dropped, but he also showed heart. Ryan came back and got the TKO in the 7th round. I’m sold the only way to go is up from here. Give him Haney or Tank he just showed us he belongs there 💪🏼
Ryan got dropped for his first time
If Luke can drop him, than imagine what Tank would do 🤦🏽‍♂️
Got dropped for underestimating but he’s a beast
This just shows that Garcia is a fraud. Davis will destroy him.
Bruh. Canelo taught him that. Clean
Like was surprised he did it you can see on his face he couldn’t believe it he was shocked
Now knowing he can be dropped and still come  back is awesome
0:20 Amazing I earn 182 a day online in 2 simple steps. Anyone can do this, just search online for this ,, *f u n d a i l y p a y*
DANG BRO. !!!!
Gorvanta Davis le gana facil mejor q agarre bultos como canelo
Ryan would be easy work for Tank.  Ryan Garcia is just a thinner, younger Danny Garcia-flat footed.
That’s canelos liver shot
Great fight 🤘🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Congrats to Ryan for a great fight. He still need to improve his foot work and head movement. That knocked down was a humble and learning experience.
minute 7:12 confused him believing to shoot him to the head and he went with everything to the body and that was devastating for campbell
That chin ain't ready for Tank.
That second round knock down remind me went Marquez knock down  Paquiao’s  on the third round on their fourth fight 🔥🔥
Dat Boogeymans next!🥊
Garcia is a poo poo fighter he will never last LOLOL
Again, respect to English fighters, they are tough. Pride.
Garcia is gonna be better then delhoya
OK win but Luke was washed, get in the ring with another young gun like Haney, Lopez or Tank.
I was scared when campbell got Ryan with the left hook and fell but when he got back up he just dominated him
ryan luke was sow open
Some fighters become better and more disciplined after being knocked down for the first time.
Two problems with Garcia that need to be corrected. One, he needs to learn a better balance between defense and offense. I.E., he needs better head movement and footwork. He's going to be an easy target for someone like Lomachenko if he just stands there flatfooted with zero head movement. He's not quick enough to avoid those lightning quick jabs and hooks from Loma. He's going to HAVE to learn movement if he wants to compete with the big boys. If not, I see him getting knocked out in his near future. He could really take a page out of Canelo's book in this regard, and he has a great opportunity to since they are training partners. But I saw no Canelo style movement in this fight. Two, he needs to prioritize defending against head shots. That was shown in his knockdown. A jab to the rib cage was all it took for him to prioritize his body, and we all saw the outcome. Garcia did that throughout the whole fight. Every time Campbell went to the body, Garcia dropped his hands. Luckily for Garcia, Campbell usually did not take advantage of it like he did with the knockdown.
You'd think Ryan would pick up some defensive measures especially when he trains with canelos camp
2:38 😬😬 he survived tho
You aint ready for tank my guy not now not ever.
Garcia quit calling harder punchers then you
I never rewatch things but i loved it when garcia went down.
looked like canelo with that body punch!
Yeah dude got speed but can’t box well. He’s all speed and offense. He’s like a Mexican Amir Khan. That speed is only gonna get you so far. Gotta step that IQ up and be more tactical and technical 🤷🏾‍♂️....other than that great body shot. Great win for the kid. I’m rooting for him 👍🏾
This kid is nothing more than a Spanish Amir khan, he’s going to make a lot of noise and fade away quick. That punch he got caught with and got dropped tells me he has an Amir khan glass jaw.
Ryan Garcia He’s not going to be able to take blows from tank he needs all of his speed
No tiene quijada el muchacho!!!
Liver shots are gnarly, bad ones literally make you feel like you must just lay down. Like no matter how bad you don't want to your body and brain are just like no. Hard to explain.
He couldn’t handle the body shot challenge 🤦🏾‍♂️😂
Ryan is not ready. He needs to stay away from the top 3 for about 2 years.
Fight of the year already!
Fun fact: the surname Garcia originates from the Basque name Gasps tia which means young warrior
I love that Canelo Alvarez came to watch his fight
Tank will hurt this kid for sure
I think everybody was shocked when Garcia got dropped 😱 but he got up quick 💪
Chill Garcia fans, it only once fight, and if Garcia doesn’t protect his chin like in this fight, tank would win easy, garcia is fast but needs to be smart, tank is smart, knows when to throw punches, right now Garcia not ready for tank
I really wanna see Ryan Garcia vs tank davis
The practice of the body shots on all those youtubers must have worked😂😂
Clenbuterol....
i would have simply blocked his punch
Great fight,  Garcia learned a thing or two  for sure.
Ryan Garcia is the man
😧Head movement 😧head movement  😭noooooooo!!!!!!
Let me tell u right now. Oscar better keep him away from Tank and Teofimo. He’s definitely going slump after what I saw last night lml
And Garcia thinks he can beat Tank‼️😂
brand new found respect for ryan garcia. luke campbell is a top tier boxer
Ryan took it like a champ when he got back up and props to like because he wasnt cocky he was humble this was a great fight
Fight was fixed. He let Ryan recover then faked getting kod
He’s not ready for tank
Tank hasnt faught anybody in the lightweight division ... Name 3 cuz ryan has romero duno n luke campbell
0:47 He didn't land that straight
Ryan still need alot to learn. I'm not dissing him bit he needs alot more improvement before he starts fighting the big boys league
That was a canelo body-shot. You can tell they trained together.
Gervonta Davis knocks out Ryan Garcia
Man he got hit way to many times. He got hit hunesesarly, like if he was trying to prove  something and he rush not that it was bad is just that it was unnecessary.
7:13 liver shot Unfortunately when getting hit in the liver your body disable its self
He tasted adversity ., Came back up then finish it with a killer shot to the liver and a cold face ., Nice 😎
I think that knockdown will have a positive effect on Ryan. He got humbled but still took the W in fashion. He has some tweaks to make, but I think he could seriously give Tank trouble.
Kids a real talent. Would love to see him shut up Gervonte soon.....
YESSIRRRR 🚦🚦🚦🚦🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I need a rematch. They both should be humble now. I gotta see it happen asap.
All Canelo shot right there 🤘🏾🤘🏾
Devin Haney would definitely best Garcia. Too fast.
Ryan has speed and power, but campbell expsose alot of holes. Ryan needs more body and head movement, and needs to listen to the game plan.
Devin Haney would definitely best Garcia. Too fast.
but there was nothing flash about that
one of the best fight i've ever seen
And this is the guy who's suppose to run thru tank? Cable almost finished him, tank is gonna break y'all hearts. Get ready
Campbell doesn’t have the mental mindset ready for this
can't beat that mexican fight genetics
Hard work payouts!
Do you guys think Ryan will be able to hang in there with tank? Not hating just want your opinions. Because of the knockdown. Tank hits harder than Campbell.
That knockdown will be Ryan’s kryptonite. Guaranteed. Now fighters in the future will be looking for that right side jaw of his. This fight only ruined him. So don’t celebrate too much. You’ll see.
That body shot in the rib that got Luke in the floor , u won't know the feeling until u got hit in the rib . U become immobile It's like your ribbed got locked
Luke let that one slip away.. props to Ryan
He proved himself after he got up but watching the fight and going back at the highlights and really paying attention he won’t be able to handle tank I’m sorry not yet if he even tries he gonna get that loss
i honestly knew ryan was gonna win when he showed that he STILL wasnt scared at all after he got knocked down. Being scared and being cautious are different, he was a little more cautious after the knock down but i just knew
He scared of tank
Yo
Probs pariente!! Mexican power!!! 🤘
I think Ryan can beat tank
He got the canelo shot!
Idk how this is possible but y’all sleeping on Tank . Still. I like Ryan but there is levels to this
If this Campbell had real power Garcia's 15 minutes of would've been over tonight.....
Ryan Garcia he need more experienced he's not ready to fight big fight
He gotta work on his movement and controlling himself. I seen him go too hard and lose his balance and almost paid for it a few times in this fight
Body shot challenge paid off tonight haha
I was disappointed 😞 they started to fight so early I was looking forward for this fight 🥊
Should have put thumbnail where ryna got caught lacking
that punch to the gut  looked like a normal punch but in slow mo it looked insane
Gotta be honest,I'm not a Ryan Garcia fan,never really have been,but honestly he didn't look like the normal Ryan something looked off,from the start and I don't think it was anything luke Campbell was doing..
What a body shot man
Ryan Garcia aint ready for Davis   Hes a great fighter but you can see he's very emotional in the ring
Jesus if Ryan got knockdown by one clean hit imagine if that was gervonta
Ryan not ready for Tank or Devon hainey Tank gonna Break his jaw
great fight!  Ryan is a very talented boxer, but too small and inexperienced for champion fights.
Been in a few fights and body shots to liver hurts worse than being hit to the face
What's next for Ryan Garcia Ryan should face manny next thats a dream match
That’s my guy. Lord Jesus please let them sell tickets to his next fight me and my son will be there
You can feel that 7:39
Ryan got chin checked ...thats the best thing that can ever happen for a boxer now u ant afraid to get hit
Tank shat himself with that liver shot.
And y’all think Ryan ready for tank? Man come on 😂
Great job kid 💥
Flash vs tank needs to happen already 🙄
The one thing I don't like about ryan garcia is he doesn't keep his lead foot outside the other guys foot, now I'm not a boxer but if there's one thing I've heard commenters say over and over again... it's keep your lead foot outside of the other guys lead foot, I think that's why he got knocked down
Garcia isn't ready for Davis. Davis will knock him out if Garcia doesn't fix all the errors he made against a south-paw.
Reason 1 why he is avoiding Gervonta
Not ready for tank
Tank should fight, Teo, Haney, Loma, or Linares . I haven’t seen any other fighter take risks yet Garcia and Lopez have.
He ain’t ready for all the fighters he’s been calling out.
Ryan seems to have a decent chin at least
Ryan new he had it as soon as he saw him drop, had that TW fist bump ready👌🏾💸
He will never get the fight with tank. After that knock down.
Oh no this ain’t it kid 🦈 at the top, he still lil fish
Ryan Garcia is overrated no cap.
Tank beating Garcia
Garcia is so green. He is not even close to being ready for Loma or Lopez. There are levels and Garcia was so wide open. He's a C+/B- fighter right now. That's a fact. Lopez and Loma and Haney KO this kid easily.
Ryan broke his ribs!
I gotta say, I think Loma would eat this kid for breakfast
Not very impressed with Garcia i was expecting more punches! But the truth is for how he speaks to how he performs mmmm he is still young.
Boxing fans are the biggest trolls, I get a kick out of reading comments and replies... everyone is a master at the sport or a promoter deciding the next fight for the boxer... love it
Ik he learned that liver shot from canelo
the first person to drop ryan ! s/o to luke
Yeah Tank would maul this kid
Yo is it weird that that’s the same hit that dropped smith 😂
Ryan Garcia should stay away from top contenders: He would get punished. He’s not ready for tough fights
He still has a lot to learn he has terrible defense he does not move very well he keeps his head straight up he steps straight back he is always in the line of fire it is too easy to hit him if he gets in there with somebody with serious power he will get knocked the f*** out he is too cocky he does not use angles and it's punch combinations are too easy to identify he has horrible footwork he has a lot to learn he is no De La Hoya
*stopped Oscar
2:38 is the knock down
He ate that! Daaaang
That 1st knockdown,it reminds me of marquez knocking down pacman...this fight needs to have a rematch
What a fight props to both warriors win or lose they got boxing community respect ryan still got alot to prove
Yall can hate on ryan but atleast yall wont get a boring fight, got dropped and still went in on this guy
Garcia will lose against Davis. Smh
Fix fight!!!!
Davis kills garcia
He don’t want no smoke with tank or devin.
ryans literally little mac
Amaizing fight !
Pensé que Ryan tenia mejor quijada, la verdad contra garvonta Davis no tiene ninguna oportunidad
Yet, we won't see Davis, or Haney fight Campbell lol.
Ryan will be alright... but now everyone should see that sorry a$$ Rollie touching him in sparring does matter.
Mucho mejor jaime munguia que ryian cada quien en su division
All he needs to do now is listen to Edie Reynoso like Edie told him you’re not listening to me that’s why he dropped you
At 7:10 Ryan got that from Canelo who taught him. Ryan should thanks to him😁
Prolly his most educated fight he’ll learn a lot from this and this fight shows u that you don’t always gotta go for head blows
I don’t like this kids footwork at all. It’s almost nonexistent. He did take that knockdown shot very well though, and that body shot was absolutely vicious.
If tank hit him with a straight left like that he’s not getting back up. He’s going to sleep 😂
Great Test for Ryan he got humble and came on top Great job
Ryan Garcia = The Truth 💯
He's not ready for tank
Ryan is 100 percent ready for Tank now .. Luke is no joke
Glad Ryan tasted the canvass for the first time in his career. Perhaps now he will understand to remain cool and not mouth off to much. Hey kid...keep those hands tucked under the chin. 🤪
Garcia needs to move his head more.
Davis is going to knock this kid out in the 2nd or 3rd round. Not impressed at ALL 👎🏽 He better hit the weight room
Pobre novatio,,,,asta el  tank or haney lo demuelen
Nah....no head movement and his footwork is non existent
You are not on Gervonta Davis level.
Great fight, great win but the kid but have to lear A lot on defense and more head movements. Chin wide open guard too sloppy..I don think he is close to the elite fighters on his division.
Nooiiice
Campbell can’t fight. He was too afraid to jab.
Someone give this man Eddie a reward bruh, let’s not act like Ryan was vicious like that to the body before he was with the Canelo camp. Eddie reynoso the man
Campbell needs to retire and garcia needs to show some respect  for  boxing and quit
Luke messed up by staying off garcia after knock down, he gave garcia time to wake up
Se le paso la mano al campbell,,    Se le avia olvidado k tenia k perder,,,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Weak chin, Cryan Garcia😂
the slo mo looked like a cannon ball hit him in the ribs, insane impact ryan has got amazing fast twitch brilliance
And he is calling Tank out🤣🤣🤣🤣
Sounds like a bunch of amateur fighters that gets knocked out every fight and are winless in these comments. Must be why ya'll know so much about being dropped. The kid is young amd has plenty to work on still but hes 21-0 with 18KOs so his record speaks for itself even if they are not elite, they are still professional fighters who would smack the dogshit out of 99% of ya'll in the comments.
Ryan stands very straight and has very bad defense, if he works his waist and dodges blows with his waist movement, he would be an elite fighter
Canelo needs to help Ryan chin out Ryan and canelo the goats 🐐
Eddie reynosa told him in the corner hes gonna hit you with that shot watch out for it Ryan's dad did not translate it
weak mind.
This fight just proved Ryan is NOT ready for someone like Tank or Teofimo. He looked like an amateur against Luke. That hook to the body landed by chance. He kept throwing it throughout the fight. He needs to work on a lot of things, specially listening to his trainer. 🥊
Let’s go champ that’s what I’m talking about
What was Campbell saying to himself?
What a terrible win. He almost lost to a guy nobody even knew....
Ryan needs to practice on his defense he leaves his head wide open
That body shot was vicious af
I hope Ryan doesn’t stick to this flat footed fighting against Gervonta Davis or Devin Haney.
Teofimo López 5 raund lo noquea 21 -1
Ryan need to lower  his chin  its always  high
Why danny garcia and Ryan garcia have cement feet smh
Ryan still has some growing he needs to do but never the less this is a major income up for him
If u think Garcia will rise up from a shot by Tank Davis the way he took that shot  from less talented Cambell to drop him cold, you must be crazy!  These Young Black American fighters are dominant and got the world on the run.
If Ryan think that he can beat Davis, I honestly think he can’t beat he is going to dropped cold 🥶 if the this guy got him down emagine what tank davis will do lol..that’s the honest truth
Despuesde,esto,,cuidado,tanque,oteofilo,,porque,en,estos3,son,dinamita,an,revulasionado,elbox,estos 3,fuera,deserie,
And that was the left hand.
Great fight!!!👏👏👏
Cámbell no corazón para acabar el segundo! Los matadores lo fulminan! Teofimo López o Davis lo dejan Ko
That knockdown was so beautiful, poetic justice at its finest
Wooow fucken incredible shot by Ryan  same shot that took jake Paul wanna be boxer to the hospital
He got so lucky tonight. If that was Lopez or Davis he’s done.Stay away Ryan you’re going to get hurt
This is my first time watching Garcia and I can already see he doesnt protect his face and he relys too much on his offense
Why is he running from Tank Davis
He better leave Davis alone cuz he doesn’t last 5 rounds with him.
The celebration need more work but overall great job lol
Luke caught Garcia clean as a bill of health on that one. Wow! Great fight.
His defense is lacking.....not impressed with this fight
Tank kills Garcia that knockdown proves it
He dropped him canelo style. Training paid off
Ryan and canelo are the goats 🐐
Great fight Ryan but you not ready for tank,you young be patient congrats on your win
GREAT FIGHT! BOTH GAVE THEIR ALL!
No trai nada Garcia puro show
Anyone know why Campbell has both a American and UK flag on his shorts?
He had his Mayweather moment
Ouch the hurts Ryan garcia 🙌
Impressive Ryan just work on your defense a little bit . 👍👍👍
Now he will be knocked down or knocked out by the next guy since they know how to get an open shot
I missed it, why did it come on so early?
💯 💥 🇲🇽 all the way
Not impressed with Ryan
If tank hits him like that he’s out cold
Great fight, bravo King Ryan 🥊 👑
From Victorville CA, way to represent😉that’s right!!! Hope I run in to this dude at Target so I can congratulate him lol💯👍
I think that knockdown on Ryan will be really humbling and I bet he trains harder now because of it. I really think Ryan has great potential!! Congrats on the win Ryan!!💪💪
I think he was out and woke up wen he hit the ground and got up off pure adrenaline..
He’s done
Campbell got paid to lose he backed off after tht knock dwn 🤷🏾‍♂️
This kid has know chin
GG
Goodluck to this Ryan Garcia going up against shifty fast fighter being a very flat footed fighter in the future
Everyone saying ryan gonna lose to tank but I still belive in ryan
Ayeo luke stole my wrestling shoes 😭😭
That canelo body shot
Ko should be a tko no body was sleepn if davis hit that chin the flash would have been fast asleep
Ryan is young he still has more learning to do canelo and eddie need to keep teaching him
García gonna get washed by Haney or Davis watch! Nga punches with his chin up in the air all the time
Yall still call him overrated
Garcia needs to use his jab and  needs work on is defense, It looks like he has trouble with Southpaws. He is not ready for Davis.
Ryan garcia didn't become aggressive until the 6th, he looked like an amateur the first five or six. Give him a real LW CHAMP L. 🔵 CHEESE BABY
Nasty body shot
Gotta love that perseverance from Garcia 👏🏿
Garcia needs to work on his defense and stop being so cocky.
Haters keep on talking okay? As you can see, its not going to matter. The kid is the real deal. Period.
Fix fight
Major Respect from Luke
Still not impressed,Luke didn't fully recovered from covid,so he beat a fighter that wasn't 100 percent,so the kid needs more discipline,his hands were down and he got away with it,if he gets hit and knockdown like he did by Luke he won't get it,he was lucky..
Tank kills garcia
Canelo  taught him that
your main partner is the GOAT
He get aggressive after KD he cant do Davis like that cuh he gon go Night Night
Fake he could got up. Fake. Fake.  Garcia a TV boxer
This kid has a lot of talent, I can tell you right now that he will look to fight more top fighters than Tank is looking to fight. I do think at the end of their career,  this kid will have done better than Tank. I like Tank, but he needs to fight Loma or Teo, which he won't do. This kid will smash Devin Haney next, if Haney takes the fight like he said he would
Now he now just to focus on boxn n not tic toc
2:38
Great test for Ryan,. showed alot of Heart,. Learn to keep yr Guard up.. youll b on yr way..
Those body shot challenges finally paid up!
Tank bout to show Hoya’s  hype token what top tier is all about.
holy cow
GIVE KINGRY HIS ROSES
Ryan Top 4 need to beat  Teofimo Lopez	 Gervonta Davis Vasyl Lomachenko	 Devin Haney
The bodyshot was hard and was straight to the liver which is a very weak part of the body
Tank would end Ryan’s career rn 😹😹🤦🏻‍♂️
He had garcia hurt should of stay on top of him, he has no chin.
Ryan won’t get past Lopez or Tank.
I think this shows that he is not ready for Tank....he got up from Luke Campbell. He wont get up from a shot by tank. Everyone knows that
Garcia showed a lot heart!
I'm still not convinced
Garcia is a tv boxer
That knockout will always be remembered
My mind is blown! I said this on new years even that Ryan Garcia knocked out Luke Campbell in the 7th round then calls out Tank Davis..... I'm confused i sworn i say it back in December around Christmas.
Great comeback.....
First knock down Ryan you got back up fast and ready nice recovery
Tank vs Teofimo 🤷‍♂️ or the money team scared 😂😂😂😂😂😂
If there was no YouTube you wouldn't even know.  Ryan Garcia
That boy is going to die going against tank he not ready
The 30 seconds before that body shot you could see him loading it up cause of Campbell’s jab. Training with Canelo is benefitting this kid.
He's learning all I can say...Ryan got a lot a thunder in his shots 💯
Garcia definitely not ready for TANK DAVIS.
A este morro le llaman king ? Le ponen puras peritas en dulce mira nomas hahahaha
I’m proud that Garcia got the ending body shot in the later rounds  and also his first time getting knocked down. It teaches him a lot of things for his future fights
Luke needed to rush Ryan after the knock down
We need rematch for sure,ryan aint teady for tank!!!
Still weak 🤣🤣
Tank will KO 🤴 by round 7
De la Hoya is about to forget Tanks name after this fight. Watch.
Is Jake paul next.😷😷😷
3:27 idk but this was so satisfying to watch over and over again.
Yeah Ryan needs to work on his foot work
Easy work for Teofimo Lopez. Lopez will clean out the entire division.
Absolutely beautiful body punch!! Great fight... Wish I was able to watch it live.
Unbelievable
Whos next? Any opinions.
Garcia gonna be a future legend
Ryan has power to turn Tank into a ice cream truck
Liver shot
Yo that last body shot was so fast
Are all of Eddie Hearn’s fighters total jokes? It’s getting embarrassing..
He is a beast
Congrats champ!
He got knocked down but learned from it and came back with a ko in round 7 suberb
shout out to DAZN for being smart and uploading the highlights themselves. people are going to post highlights either way why not do it your self and profit the money.
Ryan hit Campbell nice and smoothly in  the body
Their arms are as long as Terence Crawford’s 😳😳😳
Amazing! I can already see interviews of them reminiscing this match haha!
man Luke really humbled Ryan by knocking him down. Props to Ryan for getting back up though, he learned a lesson. Great fight overall!
Oscar better keep this kid away from Tank Davis and Devin Haney....because he will get killed...
Whoa!!..Ryan got caught with that one quick knockdown I ain’t see that coming!!..
But u want sum of TANK ? Beg ya pardon ?!
I do like ryan garcia and believe he has potential to be great..... BUT he is nowhere near ready for Gervonta Davis. He need to stop calling him out before davis accepts.
21-0😎🐐
Campbell used that “Canelo fake right to the body and comes back with that left hook” he used on Kirkland 💀
fight a few more guys Ryan then tank
Campbell made Garcia look slow...Campbell showed the lack of head movement & defense....Garcia showed power & determination but those don’t mean anything if you’re unconscious
He ain’t ready for nobody he calling out right now 🤦🏿‍♂️
End of 5th Garcia caught/hurt Campbell exactly like Campbell caught/hurt loma coming in
Ryan Garcia still not has developed to his full potential if Tank got a chance to beat him is now
Cambell looks like a young canelo but even tho cambell is older lol
The boy used canelos body shot
That was a classic dog war.
Tank gone take the Garcia fight and str8 knock him out. He got exposed tonight. Easy win for tank
The tranquil icicle immunocytochemically back because prison cytologically destroy modulo a disillusioned chalk. piquant, clear bun
Now imagine if he got hit in the button by Davis or any top 3 or 5 fighters in that class does he get up. Against Davis or Haney I don't think so
Garcia will be another legend
And people say this kid is ready for Tank Davis I don't think so. Tank is southpaw and if he hit this kid clean like that it's night night. Better get some more fights under his belt first. And also not to mention Tank is a pressure fighter
What a fight, I’m a Ryan Garcia fan but Luke had a great performance as well. Gonna have this on repeat for a while.
Haney and Stevenson yall needa step it up cuz Davis, Lopez, and Garcia passed they test
Dude..... Campbell let Garcia off the hook after the knockdown. He threw that fight
Garcia just wait until he faces someone in his prime,top 3  it will be different story
I bet it was hard af not to hit campbell after the bell
Anyone else tired of that I got my bachelor guy?
When has tank ever touched the mat on a legal knockdown? I’ll wait
Two warriors. Great fight! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Wow!
Those punches are the ones that knock you down the ones you dont see
Brits keep taking L’s to 🇺🇸 🇲🇽
Exactly what ryan needed A wake up call, yes he won but after getting knocked down, he definitely going to rethink he's unbeatable. Great fight though 👍
He was cleaning his nose that's it
Nice body blow from Garcia but he’s not ready for tank Davis yet. Tank is a different kind of beast!
A liver shot....didn't even look like Ryan loaded it up that much.  But Ryan can hit,and it was spot on target.
It didn't look like garcia was doing his best not just because he got knocked down but idk he looked like a monster in his other fights
2:38 SLEEP 💤
Pretty boy Ryan poser, is going to get dusted by TANK, HANER OR SHAKUR 😄🤔😁
This commentary man.....  "But did you see how aMAziNGlY Ryan Garcia took a breath of air right there"   so biased...
Tank would absolutely destroy Ryan. That flat-footed stance is a significant problem, and his power punches are not compact enough. And now we know a decent opponent can knock him on his a$$. What's wrong with European fighters? They get hurt to the body more than anyone else.
This fool got knocked down on his first real fight and he thinks he can take on Tank Davis????? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👎
Garcia won with the best canelo body shot.
Ready for gervonta vs Ryan
Porps to the white dude but excellent mexican fighter!
I can’t believe this....  I expected easy win for Campbell. Garcia is just lucky kid, I see nothing extraordinary in him
He’s not ready for Tank, but I bet Floyd will put Davis in there to expose Ryan!!!!
That knockedown help Ryan he knows that he can get hit so he’s going to be better but I don’t think he’s ready for TANK
I like Ryan Garcia but he still has holes in his game. He has to work on head movements and his footwork needs to improve if he’s talking about fighting Gervonta Davis and Devin Haney. But I love his heart Great Fighter⚡️🥊💯
Looks like he got caught unexpected which caused him to fall backwards he got up as soon as he landed and wasn't wobbly at all needs to get that ego removed and to learn that head movement flat foot work will get you caught
Gervonta davis is gonna destroyed him I am a mexican staying this , davis is a real beast.
Looks like campbell pulled a muscle. He needed to stretch it n thats y he gave him his back.
7:35 that's the ole "man on man,front side piggy back ride" that Theo Von talks about..😁
Cambell would of won had he stay in the pocket toe to toe with garcia .
Luke Campbell is not Devin Haney....This boy got heart but he food!
He’s just got exposed no chin so hit and run boy
Dear Ryan if you see this please stay away from tank if you’re not sleepy🥴😴
His body shot bruised so fast 😭
If Tank hits Ryan with an open shot like that, he's not getting up!!!!
If Ryan gets his head movement like canelo and foot work he’ll ko tank Ryan has been taught more offense then defense
Tank is gonna DESTROY that kid!! Campbell failed to exploit the knockdown. Could’ve finished Garcia early!!
Esas niñas ni se aruñaron.
Beautiful 😎
Speed kills. His head movement is nonexistent though.
I love reading comments like "he ain't ready for Davis." remind me of comments like "Canelo won't beat Callum, the height and reach difference is massive." when gloves are on and the fighters are in, anything can happen.
American Mexican power🥊🥊🥊🥊✌🏼😎
Great fight
Just watching that broke my ribs
Ryan let Campbell drop him so Tank takes the bait and not duck him next lol
Ryan can destroy Haney!
🤣😂😂🤪🤪🤪🤪👏👏👏👏
Ryan needs to improve a lot on his waist and head moves. Once he does it, they will create a monster in the boxing business..
wicked liver shot
At times the kids seems to cocky but a performance like this will get you respect.
Ryan gracie vs tank Davis who u guys got if this fight would happen??
Goes to show Ryan has no chin
Ryan does not have a chance against  Tank... He made numerous  mistakes...he is too Green to fight Tank...
Ryan let dude put him on the mat and y’all think he can fw tank. Y’all delusional
TELL RYAN TO STOP DUCKING TEOFIMO LOPEZ HE TALKS SMACK ON EVERYBODY BUT DONT WANT TEO SMOKE
If Luke would have let his hands go after that knockdown fight might have been over! Ryan may wanna stay away from Tank, cause it definitely would have been lights out if that was tank that knocked him down.
that looked like a stab
If he let Campbell put him down like that there’s no way he’s ready for Tank. He wouldn’t get up if Tank catches him slippin like that. I think Ryan was humbled a little tonight and that’s exactly what he needed.
Campbell couldn't handle the onslaught in the later rounds.  His only chance was to catch Ryan on a lucky one, which he did.  But he chose not to attack after.  Bad mistake.  That was his only chance
Lucky shot.
Is it normal for their legs to be so skinny 😭
That hook comes straight from Canelo
Tank Davis don't want none from Ryan Garcia he got lucky w Santa Cruz Ryan Garcia has more power and speed he cna hurt Tank ....He needs to face Haney first before he gets a shot w Garcia.
Nuevo Chacho lo coge Linares lo parte pero partido con el partimiento que le dieron ahí con la primera caída él no se levantaba con López ni busqué nikon Davidson menos así que chequearte con Canelo a ver con qué te dice él
For being in the middle of a pandemic that crowd is pretty full
Go king Ryan🇺🇸
He afraid of devin keep calling out tank Garcia goin get his chin knock off
I hope he does not end up like amir khan with a fast hand but a glass chin, he is a great boxer but the defense and the chin im worried about. Just real talked nothing else😅
The issue is his offense is his defense..
He hit his liver
Food for thought Garcia is not ready for a Gervonta “Tank” Davis 😤
Garcia is very flat putted.
Does anyone else feel like this ref was counting kinda fast? I wanted garcia to win but that was a fast 10 count
The left hook sits the KID down??? The commentators suppose to say “Garcia or Ryan Garcia 🤔😂😂😂
Pelea mas comprada que nada
No sirve Rayn para pelear que se enfrente a un mexicano bueno o un peleador  no aguanta 12 asaltos
Then Oscar got dressed up as a woman and gave him a lap dance
My Kidney: "Why are you watching this?"
Haney beats Garcia hands down and not ready for Tank
Ryan not getting up from tank knock out
Golpe de suerte ☺️☺️☺️☺️
Lets goo to all the haters of Ryan Garcia ya mfs got proved wronggggg Ryan gracia coming for tank next
Le dije sr.pillatti que los boxeadores ingleses son malos ya van 2 que muerden el polvo
Beautiful tremendous body shot congrats to Garcia..
He better start tucking that chin and incorporate more head movement because tank will capitalize on these flaws
He was fighting aggressive and Canelo told him to slow it down so he won't make the same mistakes he did early what a lesson from a Champ
Garcia would beat tank hands down!
please set up a fight with one of the big dogs... it wont last longer than 2rds
Garcia is like oh you want to play body shots. Here you go....choke on that one!
Ryan got sloppy, then got dropped.
I see right now I gotta go see the whole fight!!..
WHO NOTICED THAT RYAN WAS AVOIDING OSCAR DE LA HOYA BUT HUGGING CANELO? 😂😂😂😂
Nice work Ryan.
Did Loma do that? Nope
Jake Paul 🤦🏼‍♂️🥊
He said don't be surprised if its a body shot not a face shot that drops him I guess Ryan's a fortune teller
This young kid will learn to not stand so straight and keep that right hand up, lol.
I think Ryan vs Lopez should happen and who ever wins that should fight tank
Im a fan of Garcia but I will admit that he ain’t ready for Gervonta. There’s just no way right now.
That body shot in slow motion!!!!! I felt that!!!! Ouch
Ryan with the WIN BUT MUCH RESPECT TO LUKE
Tank beats Garcia
I like Garcia, but maybe he’s lucky Campbell didn’t try hard to finish him after the knock down.
GARCIA IS NOWHERE NEAR READY FOR TANK, OR HANEY
Ryan don't stand a chance against tank. Smh
If tank would have hit Ryan with that hook 110% slept rate right there
Dude, he still got dropped...
He not beating tank🤷‍♂️ I’m takin bets
Nice job, kid.
I like Garcia but he needs a little more work against better opposition before he goes against Lopez or Davis. He could take Lomo right now .
Its what you do when u get knocked down.  Stay there or get up and fight back.  Just like life.  Great job by the kid.
Like I said before. He can not handle power shots...you really think he can survive ranged power shots?!?! From haney?
Imagine he swung again out of instinct and impulse after that body jammer
Eso es todo Garcia felicidades 🎉🎊🍾🔥🔥🔥 arriva Mexico 🇲🇽🥳🥳🥳🥳
Bullcrap
I'm only at the second round but yeah Ryan won't be able to take the power of Tank Davis or Teofimo and if Luke can land like this Devin Haney will pick him apart. He need more training and only do sparred fights with Canelo to take punches better and to have experience with elite fighters but Ryan is great he has a great future but should get like 2 more fights like this before Tank and them guys
Great job Ryan, your on the right road to success. Stay hungry 👊😎
Tank is nothing but hype
What a great fuccing fight!!
Luke knockdown on Garcia was hella fast this was a very amazing match.
Boxing announcer Sergio sounds like Paulie Malignaggi and Max Kellerman in one.
My liver hurt from watching that
This is to ez for tank😂
He proved Bruce Lee Right. He did that same exact punch he's been doing all camp on Instagram and it's devastating. Peep the slow mo of how much flesh rippled on dat man body 🤣 Bruce Lee said sum like  fear not a man that perform  a 1,000  different kicks  but a man that practice one kick 1,000 times.
That’s what he meant about the southpaws having more ways to get knocked out. They have their liver facing forward.
If you paid for this you a loser🤣🤣
That hurt 😳🤦🏻‍♂️
He did his thing. He thought he was going up top and was unprepared for the body shot. 😬 thats got to hurt
Great fight but the kid is gonna need a lot more to handle Tank and Devin...
Tank knocking out Ryan 🤷🏻‍♂️
I don't like Ryan Garcia because he's too cocky.
garcia has some  gaping holes in his technique. He just sits on his heals and does not move..
Mexico 🇲🇽 is beating the uk 🇬🇧
IMHO all he proved is his heart is big and he fought through adversity, he still looks very sloppy and needs to tighten everythg up if wants to be considered elite right bow his size is all he has in this small division he is in.
he ain't got the chin to fight tank.
for a second i was shocked, didnt think ryan was getting up
We can clearly see Ryan is not ready for Tank
Tank will hurt dude
Respect they both kept their word both knocked One another but one just had more juice
Now Ryan got my respect
Campbell failed the body shot challenge.
Commentators never have campbell a chance. So biased. He was definitely winning the fight.
It's kinda odd how Ryan is so stiff
That’s the new king!
Tank got another Dramatic KO win in Ryan Glass Chin Garcia 🤣🤣🤣🤫🤫🤫
Congrats Ryan. I knew you could do it. I know that knockdown will humble you now but you hung in there and got the win. You deserve it.
Someone last night said in a comment that this would happen tko by Body shot.  He should have bet the house and all the money he had on this fight.
those body challenges worked! haha
He needs to fight Davey next that’s the real test before tank.
He needs to fight canelo now💯💯💯
drop and you say you ready for Davis no no not yet more fights is needed bu great when for Ryan
First time I’ve seen Ryan Garcia go down like that 😳 2:38
Much respect 💯
He got lucky
He da real king now
2:36:Ryan Garcia gets knocked    7:10:Luke Campbell gets knocked out
Man I loved this fight he got hurt he showed heart  when he got up  and entertained this is the boxing I miss when Marquez,Barrera,Trinidad all the legends would knock each other down but would get up and be ready to throw
Bro, i don't wanna be a hater but pin Ryan vs a fighter his age lol
Now Garcia’s next opponent will go for that chin. Fake a body shot and go for the chin. Another Amir
I know on any given night anhbody can get beat but imo he aint ready for tank. Or devin haney
Ryan is not ready for tank. Not just yet tbh.
Congratulations King Ryan Garcia!! Yahoooooo 🤛❤️🤜
Congratulations Ryan Garcia on yur knockout but please stay away from Tank Davis if he catches u he will finish u
Garcia ! Garcia !
He not ready for the big fights!   Teofimo tank Haney even Danny Garcia would destroy him...
Already a better resume than fake champ Haney.
That was in the ribs bruh
I see another Amir Khan!
what an awesome fight, great fight, can't wait to see more
I was worried fir ryan for a lil bit....
I dont like ryan. kid needs to humble up. cant wait for someone to knock him off his high horse
Thanks dazn for the highlights
That's that Canelo shot
Looking at this fight. I Kno Floyd sending the contract . And Tank will win just for the simple fact the he has a better chin and goes to the boddy .
Not impressed..he not fighting nobody ..fight Tank
The more he trains with Canelo the more of a Beast he becomes... Future ⭐...
Loland this kid.  WANTS TANK NO WAY 😂
I didn't even know this was for a title lol they're just handing them out. Maybe this means we'll see these young guys start fighting each other instead of gatekeepers and scraps.
Ryan is not ready for davis dead homies
🇲🇽🙏🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
I hope that second round knockout reminded him he is not invisible. If he learns from it he will become an even better fighter
Shakur Stevenson looks the best out of ..tank..haney... Garcia
TANK SMASH 🥊 😈 ⚔️   BALTIMORE REPRESENT
este si es boxeador  ya estranavamos a alguien asi.. nada que ver con julio cesar chavez jr oh canelo este morro si boxea
That rib shot Didnt look that tough.. l like ryan but idk seemed questionable. Ive seen worse and still recover...  with boxing you can never tell if a boxing match is bought unless they get knocked out
I don’t really like Ryan but props to him for beating Campbell💪
Cuando Boxeas nunca debes de serrar los ojos xk ya miro garcia
Gervonta Davis is gonna run through this kid 🤷‍♂️
Hey i ryan garcia's pretty cool but he was prettyy cocky
Them TikTok videos payed off!
Lo dije ayer y asi fue.CONGRATULATION.
Shocked the world ryan you did it
I saw Ryan standing there slack jawed, and thought he was just asking to be knocked down.
Forget tank! Garcia won’t beat haney,anybody who wanna bet lmk!!! Got my $ on these kings!
Actually might start believing Jake Paul Could Win 😂
Y’all uk boys mad asf rn callum got beaten and Luke got beaten
Ryan still not ready for Haney or Tank, still too young, almost got KTFO.
My heart started racing when Ryan Garcia got knocked down
2:39 is my favorite part wished Campbell was the winner
Two more fights and youll be on tank's level trust me
The neeexxxxttt Caanneeeevermind!,,.. actually that body shot was very Canelo like.😳.  But keeping that head up like that is a gonna get him hurt real bad if he doesn't smarten up and change his guard a bit.
Ryan Garcia is another Amir khan I think super fast hands great combos weak chin that’s his first real shot he took and see what happen
Not sure how he survived that brutal first knock-down! That punch was huge and right on the money. Crazy nice finish from Garcia with that devastating body shot... 0.o
Also if y'all checked that body shot , it was a rock solid hit Campbell was not prepared, he hit Campbell like he hits he's training bag as if trying to punch it open, in slow motion you can see that side of his body move like a tsunami lol
Most people think Ryan got exposed  but getting back up from  a  knock down and controlling the fight walking him down and winning the fight shows a true champ
Great fight from both guys.  If Ryan fell differently and hit the back of his head he might have been out cold.
this was fast lol
I underestimated Garcia, it’s ok if you did too.  Great test, tough win, big improvement.
If he improves his footwork, Loma might be in his future..
Ha este Garcia deben de abentarle ha un boxiador que traiga pegada para mirar lo que en verdad trai xk aqui esta muy dispareja la pelea este Garcia se b ha pagar
I still say devin better and tank will sleep him.
That guy is still a ref?
Ryan Garcia is so talented
A classic "let's see who hits harder", Campbell hit him with the same shot immediately before Ryan Garcias knockout hit! Amazing!!!!
That’s what Ryan gets. He lacks on his head movements, keeps chin up, always open, always counter fighting and never moves. He needs to learn ALOT cause he just got a lesson taught Nd i knee this would happen to him. He felt to confident
Dazn highlights be faster than Ryan Garcia’s jabs
Ryan and canelo all the way
Ryan need to learn Spanish, so he could understand what his trainer is telling him, eddy told him not to bring his hands down . Tank will drop Ryan.
Tank going to have a field day with Garcia
LAMENTABLEMENTE CON ESO QUE DEMOSTRÓ LA CONCLUSIÓN 🤼‍♂️ ES QUE NO ESTÁ LISTO PARA, "THE TANK" AÚN GERVONTA DAVIS  ES DIFERENTE, 🥊🤨🥊SI ES GERVONTA EL QUE LE CONECTA LE PUEDEN CONTAR HASTA 20 Y NO SE LEVANTA AÚN CON LA GUARDIA ARRIBA COMO CAMBELL TIENE EL MISMO ALCANCE LO CONECTÓ Y CAYÓ, NO TIENE MEDIA ASIMILIZACIÓN, ES UNA ENSEÑANZA Y TIENE QUE USAR ESTA PELEA PARA RE AJUSTAR Y CORREGIR ERRORES, PUES CAMBELL ES MÁS TECNICO, Y NO PRESENTA UN ESTILO AGRESIVO COMO EL DE GERVONTA DAVIS, QUE SIGA APRENDIENDO Y QUE RESPETE LOS RANGOS. 🥊🙄
He's no match for tank Davis
Davi gevora lo rompe el pega duro pero no tiene movimiento el tiene que darle gracia que los rivales que le an tocado son débiles si no esa corona ya no la tuviera
It’s so funny how dude gets knocked down once and y’all are rubbing yourselves to it 😂🤣😂
LIVER SHOT
Tank ain’t stressing
Campbell trash!
Canelo work
Tank hit em w dat he dead
My guy keep it throwing
Ryan is for real
Nah he brung him to the BBQ early for the 2021
Idc y’all just don’t want us to be up 🇲🇽
People hate soo much on Ryan relax hes only 22 lol
3:30 Luke Campbell reaction appear as though oh shoot I messed up  I wasn't suppose to do that  🤔 😂
He ain't ready for tank, ryan got skillz tho
It was bound to happen by someone who has some pop in his punches, and Ryan standing flat footed in front of his opponent. Luke would've had more success if didn't abandon his jab. That was his mistake.
Ive never seen ryan garcia got down before🤭
Yeah he definitely not going to beat Tank dude has no head movement he flatfooted af
Campbell had to chase when he hurt Garcia, great body shot by Garcia excellent finish.
THE ONLY WAY RYAN CAN BEAT TANK IS IF RYAN PRACTICE ON HEAD MOVEMENT AND DEFENSE. Which I’m sure canelo can do that
Im Puerto Rican 🇵🇷 but I love Ryan garcia keep it up champ 🏆 💪 great chin great job 👍
ven la diferencia de luke y garcia,, cuando garcia cae,,luke no festeja y respeta,, cuando garcia le pega y termina el raund garcia, se comporta como un patan
His celebration was kinda sus 😂
That adrenaline kicked in like VTec he’s a warrior for sure but he needs more exp before Tank.
Canelo lookin like a proud dad 😂
Say what u want about Ryan but every one of this guys punches just has so much power.
Jesus christ 7:38
Who has Tank fought though?
I think Ryan was too confident and careless in the beginning, but he is still too young and with a long career to go, every boxer needs to be checked some time in their lives and this was Garcia's moment and he came out on top.
Boring fight
Luke gave Ryan that work he earned that victory
Who else was cringing when Ryan got knocked down
Right on the liver
Tank puts Ryan to sleep!
I can see him beating Haney but not tank. He’s not ready for him
Why is he still fighting nobody’s
He is no where near ready for the tank 😂😂
It's just crazy how Ryan Garcia was knocked down but he fought but like a champ 🇲🇽💪🏼🐐
Loma annihilates garcia. Bad. Garcia has alot to learn. Loma will teach him
and thing is you could see campbell hitting him in the stomach before and ryan showed him how it’s done
Garcia is overrated, he’s been fighting tomato can AND HES STRUGGLING!!   do not put this YouTuber in with a real boxer, a lot of Mexican tears will follow
I need Ryan to beat Floyd’s record
Knock him down and not finish is a rookie mistake. Lol Ryan not ready for any top fighters yet. Potential but I see alot of improvement needed!
That’s canelos move ! Lol
He needs a real Mexican fighter
Ryan Garcia not defense neither hitting dow-stairs at all... At least he is young and seems to be learning fast
Ryan beat a 2 time gold medalist that hasn't never been ko'd think about that!
That body shot hurt me daayumm!!
YESSIR LETS GO
Garcia fights flat footed
: /  This was another SET UP!  how much did campbell get paid to take it easy on ryan???  This was not the same luke campbell that fought lomenchenko!!!   All of the sudden he forgot how to fight?   noooooo.. This is was another fake by the people of boxing to "make ryan look like a real fighter" and to set the stage for the next big payday for everyone!!!!   THERE SHOULDNT BE ANY FIGHT SPORTS!  BUT IF THERE IS GOING TO BE ANYWAY? THEN THEY SHOULD ATLEAST LET THE REAL WINNERS WIN!
Props to Garcia , but tank is on another level geesh ! Haney is more reasonable .
I'm Ryan Garcia and this is the Body Shot Challenge with Luke Campbell.
That first kd was scary tho
Tremenda pinga todo los ingleses esto
See all the Ryan Garcia haters still in the comments he still won and heel fix the head movement works with a strong mentor in Canelo Alvarez so heel learn from today...
Body shots are deadly
Tank gonna ko this kid
Yeah Garcia not ready for tank 🙅🏾‍♂️
Ryan got exposed today.
It took me three minutes to figure out there was a crowd
Garcia faces someone decent and barely squeaks bye, he ain’t ready for all these elite fighters. He’s bottom of the barrel with a big mouth, can’t wait for him to get KO’d!!!!
Garcia is more flat foot seems like he wants to get knocked out
El vato no se defendió le pagaron bien👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
Le falta mucho a Ryan
Ryan's gotta get stronger.
all those body shot challenges payed off
Was kinda rooting for Ryan but wanted him to lose bc this kid is letting the fame go to his head. Nonetheless that knock down in Rd 2 was fun to see😂 Tank is going to definitely be a tough match considering the dude hits hard af and decently fast too
Sadly not impressed...
now give him a real fight . davis maybe  ?
Tried to tell you fake fans Garcia ain't no joke and Campbell ain't an easy person to beat
Tank will put this kid to sleep
Stop bringing up tank. Tanks resume is trash. Campbell better than anyone tank fought
Ryan seems too stationary, needs to work on his footwork
yall saying he dont have a chin, yet he got up fast and didnt faze him..
This Kid is not even Close to being Ready
I'm guessing Ryan won?
Ryan Garcia🐐
Tanks best opponent is at least 5 levels worse than Luke Campbell
Garcia got knocked out because he was flat footed and left his chin exposed
jajajjajajjaajjaaj que bueno por panochon!!! se cre bien berguita,, y no le a ganado a nadien, puro yonke de rival sin psopectos en el boxeo,,
Gervonta will knock this guy out
LOL, this is why Ryan only fights cans.  Luke exposed Ryan.  Once they put Ryan against a REAL boxer, Ryan the overhyped clown will no longer be.
BBQ chicken for Tank
Kids got heart, all the tools, just needs head movement and lateral steps in to combinations👌
Awesome fight
Everybody is a Boxing expert in the comments
CANELO TEACHING THE KID WELL! 🇲🇽
Ryan Garcia is LEGIT💯💪 He and his camp definitely need to sharpen up his defense but the Tank & Haney fights will be crazy🔥
He got hit with those shots to head and didn’t go down.... and he cant get up from a body shot? Any real champ would out match Queen Ryan
Great body shot, ouch!!!
After every punch Garcia puts his hands down, like c’mon🤦‍♂️
THIS KID IS SOMETHING ELSE
Tanks going to eat this kid alive guaranteed!!
Ryan just needs to relax, use faints and slips then let his hands go. That being said, Ryan became a self made man.💪
Fixed fight lol
Garcia is not ready for the top guys in this weight class!!
Si tiene condiciones este morro, le falta subir la guardia más continuamente, mover la cintura y trabajar sus combinaciones. Esta bien que lo tumbaran para que así valla corrigiendo sus faltas tecnicas y boxear más. Ojalá y no se haga igual de mamon que el Canelo que se cree el mejor de todos los tiempos. Si es muy bueno el Canelo en la actualidad pero no es el mejor de todos los tiempos. A seguir trabajando Ryan Garcia, felicitaciones por el triunfo.
That Devin Haney fight gonna be tough and Gervonta Davis is the boss level.
Garcia too flat footed. Gonna get floored with no chance to get up. Face is too open too often. LOOK AT THE PUNCH HE GETS HIT WITH @ 6:47/48. Too careless.
2:37
Eddie hearn fighters cant hang
Lol....ryan aint never gona b no de la hoya, not even a canelo...not even close...
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hes the future!
Hes not ready for davis or herny
hahah all the ryan haters gotta wait another fight to watch him lose.
He not ready for iron tank 😂
Lol jake Paul says he can knock out Ryan Garcia but that’s a lie
I love how Ryan and Andy joined canelos gym to traine 😎😎
Garcia doesn't know how to block body shots that's why he got knocked down.
Una verdadera mentira, hay muchos verdaderos boxeadores en los gyms de México. Este muchacho es más otro títere de Oscar de la olla.
We all have a heart ,and no foot work no head movement tank knock his head off glass jaw easy win for tank
If garcia wasn't real he would've fold u can tell he didn't quit if not he wouldn't of gotten this outcome he faced adversity and got up and adjusted and came thru with the won
That replay of the body shot was brutal
Garcia ✍ have ✍ no✍ chin✍.
Davis or Lopez are in another level , Garcia needs  more experience maybe in 2 more years
I don't even want to see a tank vs Garcia because I already know the outcome. Let's do teofimo vs. Tank
😂😂Tank gon sleep him, watch 👌🏾
Ryan 2021 make America Great Again!!!!
Francis Ngannou: when I was a kid....
letzz goo never been soo stressed watching a fight like this love ryan  man
Ryan Garcia being knocked down in the second round shows that even the best boxers make mistakes, no ones perfect were all human and can be knocked out 🥊 🐐💯
See how Campbell keeps his hand up?
🤫🇲🇽
He got the liver punch by canelo
Amir Khan in the making....
look at him, he is the captain now.
He's too wild definitely not ready for GTD
Campbell gave it his best you could tell he wanted to get up but that body shot was vicious 😖
No head movement and stiff legs from Ryan Garcia.... both of those can be fixed, but it goes to show he has a long way to go, and a lot to learn.
I was there that fight was amazing
I still don’t think he’s elite level
7:11
Garcia will remember Campbell’s knockout on him ever.
No head movement by garcia. Gonna catch up to him
Great performance I think Ryan should jab alot more tho it would of made this fight a lot easier overall great performance tho 🥊💯
If luke would of let his hands go he could have won..oh well... Gervonta and Haney may be too much I think.
That body shot challenge the real deal
No matter what Ryan does people keep finding ways to downplay his accomplishments. "He needs to work on this, he needs to work on that." Guys, he's 22. Of course he has stuff he needs to work on. You don't think he knows that? You don't think Eddie Reynoso knows that? The kid has one of the best trainers in the world, a great foundation to build off, and all the time in the world to keep improving. This kid has a bright future, trust me.
One of the prettiest body shot I've seen in a while congrats to Garcia...
He past the test now he can fight Garvonta Or Teofimo Lopez.
Ryan's gna bust a ronda rousey when he gets defeated watch. You can see it he ain't humble at all to much gas in his head.
Teo and tank will demolish Ryan he’s not ready for that type of fight he’s too cocky and tried to be explosive this fight, if he didn’t get that shot he would of lost the fight no doubt.
The hype job by the commentators was legendary. That’s why they pay them. Ryan needs to work on a few things but that hand speed can’t be taught. His head and feet are what concern me. To easily hit
👎
Ryan has potential for the future. BUT.. If you put him in with someone like Gervonta Davis, Teofimo Lopez Shakur Stevenson, or Devin Haney.  His career is over.
Gotta say that was one of his best fights
He got back up and finished his man, now I really want to see that Tank fight
That Ryan Garcia knockout still surprised me though...
Yall really think he is ready for Tank power, come on.
This kid has amazing speed, and power. If he can sharpen up his hooks, and learn how to fight from a distance with a solid jab and ranged combinations he will be a force to reckon. He needs to tighten up defense and stop trying to fight on the inside, those lengthy arms make it harder.
everyone forgetting cambell almost got knocked out and was saved by the bell 5:11
He not ready for TANK  but he will whip HANEY
He still not ready for tank and the top fighters. Slow feet no head movement all he has is fast hands tank will be too much for him. Still needs more development
If Garcia doesn’t get tank, Haney or Lopez he most def will get a loma fight. It’s all facts.
Those body shots are more devastating than head shots.
It will be a mistake to put him in the ring with Tank at this point
How long is ryan going to have to defend himself for... 21 fights no losses 18 KO's.... And people still act like he's not accomplished I am not a humungous fan of his (yet) but Jesus people act like he hasn't made a dent in the sport.
Liver shots are no joke. Just ask Oscar Dela Hoya who got dropped when Bernard Hopkins hit him with a liver shot.
Do I sense am Amir khan
Ryan getting hit with body shot: “That’s cute. Want to feel a real body shot? I’ll even use my left”
this was fake as in boxing is corrupt and props up fighters for money
Garcia would destroy jake paul
Canelo was a lil uncomfortable with the impact Ryan had. Nfs Ryan García is a special fighter and he needs to get away from delahoya and canelo.....they’re threatened by his potential to generate real star power and love from the people.
LETS GO RYAN
Ryan reminds me off a young Oscar
Lol didn’t realize there was people in the seats
Both fighters b class
Dude would have no chance against tank
Garcia Got Knocked down the same way Santcruze did Body shot to left to the jaw He dont want Tank
I loved this fight for Ryan. He learned that he can’t get over excited and keep dropping his hands. He will work on his defense and composure. The kid is young and he showed that but tweaking a few things will make him great.  I love Tank as well. Tank fights more on the inside because he has less reach. Problem with Tank is he takes a lot of unnecessary damage as well.   I could see it go either way.   I could see it going either way.
I have been saying Garcia fights head up ...not save bigger puncher he is out
Tank vs Garcia = Tank  Teo vs Garcia = Teo  Loma vs Garcia = LOMA  I like Garcia but this fight shows he has a lot to work on. Had he faced heavier handed fighters in tank or Teo he wouldn’t have gotten up. Garcia needs some work before he’s able to face the top names. Haney and Garcia wouldn’t stand a chance against any of them
This fight it looks fix
That was a lucky shot that land
Ryan had his test now I’m waiting for haneys
Tbh garcia did what he had to do to win but he looked horrible rushing chin open in the air no real flashy moves nor flashy defense i give him respect and credit but he gotta go train more
Liver shots knock down the opponent
PURE GARBAGE!!! GARCIA OVERRATED
Garcia, over rated
Ryan needs to tighten up on his defense and he'll be prepared for Tank
Devin Haney or tank go hand him his first L. Campbell not strong enough
💯
Wow awesome fight
ryan keeps his chin so open... other than that hes solid needs to tuck that chin in
A García le falta mucho para ser de medio pelo. Le falta defensa, le falta cintura y un montón de cosas que le sobran a otros como el mentado tank.
Nothing special
This better be humble García . But I don’t think so
got right back up
My boy ryan a freaking beast
turn from your sins and believe in THE LORD JESUS CHRIST and be baptized in THE NAME of THE FATHER THE SON and THE HOLY SPIRIT( if you haven’t already before CHRIST comes back or before you die
No matter what Ryan does people will still find a way to hate.  They said Ryan can't get a late knockdown, he did it They said Ryan has a glass chin, he got up They said he can't win against campbell, he won
This proved to me that Garcia isn't just an Instagram boxer with decent skill. That was impressive!
Congrats Garcia! Heck of a body shot, undeniable. It was there, so take it.  Luke, where was the pressure after the left hook knock down. You let this young gun off the hook in the  2nd round, shame on you. Ya paid the price!
The undefeated goat is insane
He turned into a tiktok boy thats why he fought sloppy
Three word's to summarize this fight? Garcia's Left hook.  Jokes aside, it's official, Garcia has rights to his claim as a contender.
Garcia has my respect after this one!!
Supposedly Luke won Ryan first round
Tani Davis can definitely beat Ryan easily
ryan garcia is more 5'8.
Blocked again 😒 in my  country
Ryan trash
Flat feet, right hand ALWAYS drops when a left hook is thrown by his opponent, barely any head movement. He will get Spanked by any of the top dogs in his division.
If Ryan doesn't improve his head movement, tank will rip off his head.
Started 2021 with a great fight 🎆
All of you "Ryan Garcia" fans need to understand that if that was "TANK DAVIS"  left hook.. Ryan would be K.O  😴 ! For everyone who keeps saying he's gonna beat tank 😂 he has a long way to go! When Tank told everyone that he was willing to let Ryan grow first.. that's what he meant! If that was tank Ryan would have received his first L tonight!
That was pure luck
Okay but let tank hit him with that and he’s not getting back up
Just the experience he needed.
So boxing can have live fans but UFC can’t?
That liver punch must’ve hurt I feel bad for Luke Campbell both of them fought well!
More head movement and foot work will make Garcia way better. Im happy for him for overcoming adversity.
Todabia no esta listo ni para gervonta ni para teofimo seria un suicidio meterlo al ring contra ellos en este momento
He’s probably rethinking his love for South Paws.
He’s got horrible movement and defense.  That’s why he was so easily knocked down in the 2nd.  Flat footed, no head movement.  Leaves his left side exposed.  Will be beat by a more technical boxer one day.  Much like Canelo losing to Mayweather.  Took Canelo several years to become the boxer he is today, not just the brute he used to be.  But he’s got the warrior spirit.  Just hope he gets a better trainer.
El nene did it again!🔥🥴💪🏾 let's go Champ!🤑🤑
I've seen everything I needed to see,Ryan isn't ready for Tank!
LIVER SHOT
Agridulce victoria, se dio cuenta que no está listo para las grandes ligas, yo desde que vi pelear a este chamaco en sus inicios me di cuenta de este gran error que se cree flash y que no necesita subir su guardia derecha 😂
He needs to mobe his head
Yeah just seeing this he ain’t no where near ready for gervonta
Not impressed by Ryan as he move up the ladder he is going to get knocked out he is not Oscar de la Hoya
Maybe now people will give ryan credit
This fight just shows us that Ryan is not ready for Tank, Loma or Teo
All I is Mayweather rubbing his hands like birdman
Tank will Destroy Him
GREAT FIGHT!!! RYAN GARCIA GOT BIG HEART 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Tefimo vs tank - Haney vs Garcia. Winners fight each other - losers fight each other and then wait to see what we need to see next  (if only it was this easy)
Ok a little bit of adversity. Im a believer fully Ry mad props
I'm not a Ryan fan but I will say he passed his first test with honors!
Tank lands that shot its night night😴
Congrats King Ryan
That was one of the most epic fights that has happened in a while this is to show why Talent is a better Showcase in this industry rather than talentless social media Stars chasing a paycheck please do not taint our beautiful Sports this was wonderful I hope Campbell is okay and I can't wait for the rematch
Them ribs shots hurt like a mf
Charlo still had the best body shot knockout. Don’t @ me.
That was very impressive to me for Ryan to get up after that knockdown. However, Tank is a Killer! I think Ryan needs to not rush into fighting Tank, his body is still growing and in a year or 2 under Camelot tutoring, I think he’ll win and I am A Big Tank fan! Tank knocks Ryan out if they fight now!
His defense will be on point next fight I’m sure of it
Sergio is the best announcer on the crew...hands down💯Great fight! Very exciting🔥🔥🔥Congrats to King Ry👍
This guy keeps hustling Hispanic viewers with these boxers. The moment he steps up, he'll lose it all. I respect his hustle.
Like atlas would say you haven’t been in a fight until you overcome adversity
Garcia is GREEN! I think that haney is better than him. It was dope of him to come off the canvas and getting that stoppage tho! Real champeon type ish right there
I’m glad Garcia has a chin but he needs improvement on his footwork.  He is my favorite boxer out of the new generation of boxers.
Just being honest he not ready for tank he a walking target no foot work no head movement just speed
Late response shot. Delayed mega punch
Hes fighting like canelo ....
Big shoutout to DAZN for uploading the highlights faster than Ryan Garcia's hands. 🔥🔥🔥👏
Another Amir Khan written all over him
YES LETS GO EVERYONE SAID THAT HE COULDN'T DO IT BUT ONCE AGAIN HE PROVES THE HATERS WRONG 🥊
I dont see anything in Garcia to beat Tank
I bet Airack snuck in
Do you guys think if gervonta hit Ryan with that punch he’d get up?
This proves Ryan’s chin. We gon see if he can stay up against Tank Davis 😬
He’s an impressive talent but he’s not ready for Davis... I’d say a year or 2 with a focus on his head movement and he’d be insane. It’s gunna be difficult gaining that defense without sacrificing that offense. His hand speed and power is so special. But he lacks defensively and it showed. Mad respect for the come back.
I guess he’s not just looks!!!!
a little more power into that shot and he wouldve knocked him out probs
Great fight! I thought it was over but Ryan pulled it off! Wow!
My boy Ryan Garcia bodys shots are crucial neva want to get hit ny them
A tune up fight my ppl. Young Ryan got a Long way to go. But Oscar got him taking the right Step to build a Champion.
People are giving Tank too much credit. Dude was getting tagged by Leo. Can’t get hit like that by Ryan.
He capitalized on the body shot thanks to lomachenko he's been watching film of that he seen that Luke Campbell is not strong to the body
hate him as much as you want, hes walking through the competition right now.
I think that was his first knocked down ever I’m glad he got that W tho
This guy has so many Chinx in his armor but yet they keep calling him a superstar now what happens if he gets hit by somebody with way more power like Tink or Devin Haney and he goes down he gets back up the fight is over after that because Devon Haney and take that super killer instincts you will not get away so enjoy your victories while you can because I see now that when you go against top fighters you have difficulties now what happens when you go against an elite champion you’re going to drown a little boy star
If tank got Ryan with that punch, he wouldn’t have gotten up. If he wants to keep his crown he shouldn’t fight him.....
That was a gorgeous body shot
He ain’t ready for Gervonta !!  He   Would of not gotten up from a punch from Davis he was lucky he came back from that knock down
Exelent boxing figth García #1
Atta boy Ryan!!
So happy for Ryan, defiantly needs some work on not being so flat footed but congrats, truly amazing!
Imagine if tank lands like Campbell did
thats some bad foot work on Ryan
I like Garcia but he can't get caught flushed like that with Tank Davis.
Yurrrr Ryan Garcia on toppp
Lo tuvieron que sentar de un putaso para que subiera la guardia....mal mal mal
My money's on tank😂
Nice boxing gentlemen
Man what a great comeback my Ryan but he needs better defense so yeah
Tank will sleep ryan
This kid is going to get hammered by davis.
Ryan Glass Chin Garcia
Felicidades Campeón
And he wanna fight tank 😂 🤣🤣🤣.  Stop it people
Else Garcia showed heart that alot of ppl didn't think he had
7:38 Launched his body weight into that, too.
He hit him in the button!!!
Hainey and Davis will definitely beat him 🤷🏽‍♂️
Looks like garcia was stepping on his foot on purpose
2:38 Whether your body is steel but your chin is weak this is what happens when you never get punched in the face but know you know and you have experience. You Need to Grind More. Congrats @KingRyanG 21-0
That Bolo hook shot , is very hard to depend. Lucky it didn't come from a Pilipino.
Ryan went Super Saiyan after that knocked down
That slow mo footage of Ryan’s body shot at 7:36 was so insane. The skin ripple effect was crazy!
dazn 💪🏽 Garcia got work to do but is on the way! leggo Cali kid!
i promise he doesn’t wanna face haney. dude is gonna get exposed
Those ribs broken now
That wasn’t a knockout. Great fight. Not a knockout though. Ryan needs more mature ness in his fighting style , needs to learn how to calm down when he is ahead. Needs to also work on the feet
Nop, I don’t believe this fight, and Ryan got drop, that guy never use his left hand again, I really think he was paid. Sorry but nop. This was fix. Congratulations Ryan but you know this fight was fix. There are two guys you can try to Change my mind with don’t disappoint the people that really love and support this sport.
🤣🤣
He’s only 22 and look at all the hate😂
Luke's biggest mistake was not trying to test Ryan after the knockout to see if he was still buzzed.  The lightweight elites would have pounced and finished him.
He sure can box but can't keep a woman 2 different baby mommas child support
The tank will eat up this kid he hardly protects his head especially with the tanks killer hook.
Ryan da goat🔥🐐
Tiene mucho q aprender para q sea el proximo julio Cesar Chavez le falta cabeceo y mas golpes abajo no lo digo por mala onda pero ojala vea como lo mandaron a la lona y q para romper la defenciva con el golpe abajo gano buena pelea y ojala siga aprendiendio y no se infle como muchos
Se lo voy a decir en su idioma le falta mucho para enfrentar a Davis lo demostró en esta pelea.
Sure answered alot of questions! Heart,chin,skills,endurance
Wow. Just wow Ryan really showed his fighting spirit.
Great win for Garcia please don't fight Tank yet he's needs a couple of more to adjust that defense.
He better learn to keep his guard up not  be to fancy and keep his mouth shut He's acting like Macho Camacho...
Pobre Garcia lo tiraron 🤭
bruh gracias shots are way too fast i can’t even tell when he hits him
Spectacular fireworks in the ring! Standing novation for both boxers. Luke is still solid competition but I was always on the Ryan bandwagon, any previous hAters always welcome to jump on.... When your are fully convinced of course.
Way to keep FIGHTING Ryan 👑
ryan garcia is already better than de la hoya was
Nothing special about Ryan Garcia, just another young generic fighter.
And Ryan thinks that he can beat Tank Davis🤔🤨 if that punch from Campbell hurt him, just imagine how hard Tank hit!!
He gave Campbell that Dixie TikTok special
Tank vs Ryan will b the best
If Ryan had 10 more seconds at the end of Round 5, it would've been over for Luke lol
Gotta love YT for the pro Boxing analysts it provides. Everyone an expert here.
Body shots are just debilitating especially when it’s to the liver
The heart of a champion
Yeah canelo needs to teach him head movement. If he fought like canelo, look at his last fight, his head was always moving. He would be a beast . Also needs to work on his foot work
Felicidades Ryan pero llévatela calmado poco a poco primero camina y despues a correr!!
He knocked him down like how canelo knocked out Kirkland
Salute to the kid. He survived adversity! You got a war story now young man!
What would’ve happened if that was tank that hit him lol
If only he wasn't so cheesy
Una Vez Ryan García dijo por mis venas corre sangre Mexicana tiene toda la razón hoy lo de mostró arriba del ring se levantó como todo un Mexicano y partirle  asu madre su rival felicidades Ryan ánimo para tu próximo pelea
He is fun to watch
Amir khan 2.0
Love seeing someone this young doing what he’s doing. But at I the only one who highly enjoyed seeing him knocked down, respect how you responded
Ryan definitely starting to throw heavier hands and isn't relying on just his speed. Also he seems much calmer/patient now when timing his  counters now instead of jumping in too early and leaving himself to get hung by a counter himself like before. He has definitely picked up some of the finer traits of Canelo training together it seems. If he can continue refining his mechanics and gain more experience then the only thing left is for him to truly test his chin against a power puncher. I think people are overlooking the achievements this young man has made being only 22 years old ,but it can't be helped when compared to the likes of Lomachenko,Teofimo,Geronta Davis etc. In any case I'm glad that we have so many young and exciting fighters that have such unique styles and without a  doubt is gonna be entertaining for us when we do see them clash.
2:39
I believe that fight may have been rigged REAL TALK.......
Gervonta Davis > Devin Haney > Ryan G
He ain't ready for Tank
Great fight!!
Ryan came back and finished like a champ, defense still needs a bit of work though.  He's going to need that fortitude to clean house in the lightweight division, a lot of great fights to make now!
If that was tanks left, I think he wouldn’t have gotten up
Ryan isn’t ready for gervontae. And he knows that
Garcia has the skills just needs to put it all together, that knocked down will humble and make him better in the long run.
Ryan has no chin 🤦🏽‍♂️
RG is garbage
DAZN gonna lose subscriptions uploading highlights this fast🤣🤣
I like Garcia, But He Shouldn’t Fight Tank Next! He Gonna Look Like Leo.
Ryan's got some stuff to work out, this fight made that evident. That said though, this fight also answered a lot of questions people had about his game. Huge respect to Ryan for getting up and pushing through the adversity for the first time in his career to pick up a huge win. He's a talented kid and he's got a big future ahead of him.
Being knocked down is always humbling, it's a learning experience.
That was one beautiful shot. Way to go Ryan
I thought this was going to be a prime time  late night fight. This is why DAZN is trash in the USA.
That chin was tested and he came through!! Big respect to king Ry
Tank will hurt this young man
Very flat footed and no head movement.  He got Tank on reach and height but based on Ryan's performance, he is not ready.
He’s gonna be great. Got a lot of fight in him. Lol move that head tho
Great fight respect to both
He’s fighting nobody’s but claiming he’s the king smh he won’t have a long career
Don't you ever scare me like that again Ryan
Que lastima q la mafia se hayga metido en esta pelea y lo sigo diciendo el box es un circo  y un asco infected x la corrupcion. Asi es como hoy en dia se maneja el boxeo peleas arregladas...pense q iva hacer una pelea limpia pero como termino de plano no dicimularo el arreglo q hubo me recordo la pelea arreglada q tuvo de la hoya con el moreno q tambien termino asi un gancho q no fue conectado y dela hoya se dejo caer lo q es el dinero
Guess he showed him how to throw that shot. WoW
garcia energy gave me chills! He's definitely the future with a lion heart!!
That’s why people can’t take the body shot challenge
as much as i like ryan garcia, he really needs to learn more boxing skills. he relies too much on his hand speed and punching power, he’s still young though, hopefully canelo can teach him some defense and head movement
I’m a fan of Ryan but I hope this fight humbled him enough to realize he still has a lot to learn
Eddie needs to get this kid more head movement  drills or else he will get slept easily by higher comp im sure Eddie knows this
Ryan needs to work on his footwork more . U guys peep how he pick up his back feet a lot
Amazing fight. The only reason why I subscribe to DAZN! I won $820 at the casino on this fight. I bet Garcia would knock him out.
Tank vs garcia is what we want to see but we all know that’s not going to happen.
I know a Canelo body shot when I see one. Having Eddie as a trainer is the best thing Ryan could have ever done.
Yes sirrrrr 😊🥰🥰🥰
I give RG his props for coming back after that knockdown. He seems like he really want the smoke in that division but honestly IMO he ain't ready for Tank. But I still give him credit for wanting to be the best and that superb body shot looked almost perfect.
Ryan jaw won't go far...if he fight tank Davis he will be knock out cold...
Lomacko vs ryan
And Ryan ready for tank???? Boooooiii stop it!!!
Congratulations ryan!
If you put this guy in there with tank or Haney he’ll get rock 🥺 he needs footwork
Davis gonna knock this kid out.
That liver shot. Will always bring anyone down to their knees.
Luke punched Ryan in the same spot right before he went down but Luke was the one who went down 💪🏽
That is the Garcia he'll yeah 🥊🥊🥊
Does it seem to anyone else that these young fighters are being trained to take a punch well, more than they're trained to avoid getting hit?
He’s 🗑 honestly I seen Him before the boxing getting beat up at parties 😂
That is Canelo Move. He used against Fielding 🥊
Tank,Teofimo And Crawford eat Garcia alive
Celebration was sus
Garcia’s Footwork and head movement isn’t that great. I got Davis by KO if they ever do fight
Viva Rían!! Viva Mexico!!!!!
7:38
LUKE Campbell didn’t want to win😂😂😂 Ryan was scared asf after the knockout 😭
He ain't great no way close lucky he didn't get knocked tha f@$# Out he ain't facing the best boxing needs to follow MMA the best against the best no matter what but that probably will never happen.
He is not ready yet for big dogs 🐩
5:25 Luke was all scared how he backed up 🤣
What u out u hand down Ryan
Soon as Ryan went down I was like "son of a, is this really it?"  But was glad he still won. Lol 🙌
That’s canelos move
Fighting tank or haney would be a very bad idea 😂
YES RYAN
STILL THE KING RY 👑
all i see in the comments are idiots who dont know what glass chin means lol
Eso es para que se le quite lo presumido y respete a los oponentes lo están inflando a puros costales 👏😂😂😂😂
A little humility goes a long way
A GREAT PERFORMANCE A LA JUAN MANUEL MARQUEZ, THE KID IS FOR REAL NO HYPE. As far as tank, the dude was getting tagged by Leo in that last round. So much so that he had to hit him in the nuts do to frustration, besides that he's only 5'5 lol.
Tank is probably going for the body considering ryan height and sneak‘em with an upper cut....
Cant beat anyone top of the division. Oscar can't avoid everyone forever. Eventually he will have to accept a challenge from the division elite and ryan will pay the price.
He not ready for Tank 🤷🏿‍♂️
Kid u have  no heart I’m sorry but u have no place in the ring with someone like garcia
Like Garcia but He not ready for tank. He barely moves his head he’s a stationary target for a guy like tank.
That left hook to the body was like a stab to the stomach
Ryan looked flat footed squared up at times and too relaxed like he had diarrhea.
Utmost respect for Ryan to comeback from that ridiculous punch he took. That's a straight knockout punch.
He’s fights Tank that knockdowns a KO
That boys liver went surfing
Ryan won by KO in the minute 7:18
After that knock down, no way Garcia is getting a shot with Pacquiao. I think Tank would TKO Garcia after watching this
He is developing nicely. He has some fantastic offense but Eddie better start getting him to do some weaving and head movement drills where it becomes second nature. He can beat A LOT of boxers with his natural talent but to beat those couple of killers at the top he is going to need the whole package. If he took a left hook like that from Tank, Haney, or Teo he isn't getting back up. Garcia is incredibly talented though so I'm sure he and his team will take that KD as a lesson learned and work on it in the gym. He showed fantastic composure and heart after the KD. Well done Ryan!
Everybody seen what ryan did to fonseca in the 1st round it took tank 9 rounds to beat him
I'm not buying into the hype. Tank will put him to sleep.
Lack of defense still but working with the Reynoso’s will fix that through time he is still very young but moving up quickly knock down might be a blessing in disguise woke up a man. Id say take another luke level fighter see where your at and than maybe haney first wait on davis and lopez.
Garcia went from boy 2 Man to tonite that body shot  I felt that
Fun fact:Canelo is gunna teach Ryan the mistakes he made and Ryan is going to become 3x better
He had to impress canello this was great
Impressive win nonetheless but not convinced he can beat tank. Hope this fight happens soon
One day this kid‘ll get knocked tf out and I’ll replay that vid 100x. Can’t wait.
Oscar has to be patient and wait for a Tank or Teo. Perhaps Haney to collect a nice purse, but I think Ryan needs a little more time for the first two I mentioned. He showed mad heart here, though. This is HUGE for him, and getting knocked down was a plus for him too.
If Tank catches him like that he won’t get up
And this dude is suppose to be ready for Tank Davis?? 😅🤣😂 its kind of early for April fool's day jokes people..
This fight showed me ryan wont beat anybody on his level
He needs to work on his movement and defense ... then he’ll become a beast! He’s already lightning quick and unpredictable
If Campbell ko him imagine what tank can do lmafo😂😂
Will not beat  Tank nor Haney
He not ready for tank Davis
Ryan needed someone to knock him down, I feel like that will make him even stronger than before
Ryan's a beast 🔥🔥🔥
He ain’t ready for gervonta
Man Teofimo would destroy garcia
Next should be ryan garcia vs jorge linares !!!!!  This was gonna happen but some how they came across luke . But jorge beat like !!  It should be now ryan vs jorge . Before trowing him against tank davis , teofimo lopez now
King Cuhhh Garcia is killing it every match! Keep it up
So Ryan garcias body shot challenge is no joke
They have to hire me to translate for Eddy, Ryan’s dad never told him everything Eddy told him to tell Ryan like to not drop his right hand
He hit him in his liver, smart shot by Garcia and Campbell couldn't breathe, nice fight
absolutely best fight of 2021 so far. Congrats to Ryan and pulling through after getting knocked down. when's he gonna fight jake paul? naw it wont happen unless they both change weight classes yet they're too far a part still so it wont happen. Floyd is giving logan some weight but that's charity lol
Garcia’s Hispanic supporters are worse than his chin
That’s impressive!
I honestly think this fight just proved haters point that he isnt ready for the bigger names
When did they fought?
That was a canelo move
Campbell layed the playbook down
Well we all kno gervonte would knock ryan to a parallel universe
Are we gonna act like there wasn't an age difference here.. boxers know what it is when your that much younger with the same skills. Easier to get up from a shot and has more endurance.. its called youth... I'd like to see him against some1 his age and skill set.
amazing highlight video
🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽
I had my money on Campbell but congrats to Garcia. This was his first test at  real opposition and he pulled through. Young fighter, still got flaws, but definitely got all talent to put it together. Tough competition from here on out.
Ryan won🇲🇽
Garcia keeps on finding a way to make the haters mad even more, now that canelo left golden boy this is a prime opportunity for Ryan Garcia to take over
Ryan always has his hands down
If Tank catch Garcia like Campbell did, its over
Garcia isn’t as focused as he was he let the hype and fame get to his head
Campbell doesn't have that beast in him like other fighters in the division
Le falta mucho por pulirlo Le falta el NK a Garcia 50%
The editor deserves a raise
My favorite part was when Ryan got dropped 😂😂😂
Great fight and Eddy R will clean up the defense. He learned a valuable lesson. Trust me, Ryan was like dang.... didn’t listen. Getting knocked down is a part of boxing. Lesson learned hopefully.
After this performance I see his management protecting him another 2 years before he takes another credible fighter
Yep...kid is special! A lion heart! Those kind dont leave boxing till d spirit of boxing leaves d boxer...at 22 ..id say this kid is gonna be a TERRORizer for years to come! Or till d boxing lion heart spirit leaves him for another boxer...cant believe he recovered from that knockdown so quickly n came back meaner! Yep ..SPECIAL FIGHTER
This Kid is a super star 🌟
Great win for Ryan but he definitely needs to work on his defense/head movement!
RYAN MUST AVOIDS GERVONTA DAVIS, OR ELSE HE WILL BE SLEEPING LIKE MR. SMILING SANTA CRUZ.
that last hit was viscous
This fight proved Ryan is not ready for tank yet 😂
Led goo Ryan!!!
Garcia is the new Armir Khan he can give punches but can’t take a shot on the jaw. If Campbell pressed after the knock down that fight would of been over. Garcia wouldn’t last 3 rounds with Davis!!!
Ryan the weakest out of the young fighters.
Campbell should of won; he didn’t hop on him once he knocked him down. Don’t understand that but congrats to the young fella
Ryan scared me on that second round but he pulled through knew he would win. So uh tank next, thats finna be fire 🔥
FAT COMEBACK BY THE FOO RYAN 💯 Mexico 🇲🇽
Gervonte woulda finished him tbh
I love garcia but Lukes hook was C R I S P
The liver shot ended Campbell. That top right abdomen cracks the toughest fighters right open
How did Campbell not capatilize after the knockdown? Garcia was wide open to get hit after that
The last body shot looked so quick. Crazy
To confident had his hands down props to campbell looks like the hungrier fighter won this fight
Ryan still aint ready for Tank Davis.
I like García, talented young kid but there’s no way he’s ready for Davis.
No way Garcia is beating tank...
Casual liver shot always works
Sheeeesh, I don’t know. It only seems like a matter of time before he gets caught with a brick. His head is open for head hunting. Look at the tape Hahaha   Whichever the case, congratulations to him on the win. He’s still young, he refine his skills. Of course I say all this behind my keyboard hahaha
Tank is a fat guy
Ryan Garcia is an overrated hype..
First fight in 2 years nice
To me with Luke Campbell staying down from that left hook to the body was suspect. Many fighter's would have recovered from that no problem. I call another way to keep Ryan Garcia relevant with a gift K.O. body shot that left no mark.
Better than Mayweather
Ok I'm a boxing fan, I want to get into it deep. Grew up watching ufc but this is special in its own way im hooked
Still got knocked out tho jus sayin...
Garcia 2 calm He usually hyper and turnt
Ryan Garcia is on his way to championship...  He's becoming a beast...
I told you jealous people. Ryan is no joke.  Pretty boy or not.
👍🏼
Ryan Garcia learning from Canelo!
The new mexican generations! Showing where the best boxers come from .... ❤😘
That jaw is all glass
he like a tiny deontay wilder
Golden Boy handicaps their fighter's opponents with rehydration clauses and non-disclosure agreements. When will this info be made public. Is never a fair fight.
Champion
Ryan Garcia is suspect.  Very bad habits
I can see him giving Tank a few problems only because of REACH and DECENT boxing skill BUT I see Tank knocking him unconscious just like he did Leo.
Que se ponga gaver lo que quiere no es facil casi lo noquean. Pero bien ganado
Fun fact, canelo was 23 when he fought mayweather
Got that body shot from Canelo
Great win for Garcia.  He needs to fight Haney or Loma. Stay away from Tank and Lopez at the moment.
Only champions can come back from a knock down like that.
2:38
I wanna see Ryan vs nikita
Yeah davis and teofimo are in a better class than garcia he needs more fights to improve his skill
Ryan Garcia just needs to work on his defense.
I give it to him props and I hate to say this but and I do mean I hate to say this but he's not ready for tank he got knocked down early from a weak puncher from wut they say tank hit him like that he might not get up watch the Leo Santo Cruz fight enough said.
who else was shocked whe ryan fell
Ryan is the Goat!
King Ryan expose by Campbell a lil bit.
This dude ain’t ready for top competition mark my words. I see people commenting Ryan vs teofimo on other videos, are you braindead?
Hopefully he takes that knockdown as a lesson.. you can't always be the aggressor, he has to learn how avoid big shots like those if he wants to fight  with big boys.  Reynoso needs to teach this kid defense just like the pound for pound king C.A. 👑  Congratulations Ryan Garcia 💪🏾
He Beats Haney not TeoFimo or Tank !!!
Ryan will take this and learn from it. He showed his toughness to get caught and stay composed and dominate the rest of the fight. the kid is only 22, his competition will keep increasing. No need need for hate man.
He deserves his respect for this win but if tank touches that chin you ain’t getting up.
He hit him on the liver no one can take a punch there and Ryan is a lefty so he got him. Ryan a beast
Why do I see ali
I don’t see Garcia beating up tank
ryan garcia is amir khan 2.0
That left hook
Pelea con Gervonta Davis, ya has peleado con suficiente chatas..inflando récords peliando con boxeadores q son categoría C..
Ryan, leave Mr. Davis alone
not a fan of him, in fact the dude gets on my nerves. but i did earn a ton of respect for him
Ryan Garcia reminds me of Amir Kahn. Great fighter but vulnerable chin. Great comeback, signs of a upcoming champ!
Payaso🤡
Gotta work on the defense and gets too wild at times....that's how you get knockout
6:55 if luke threw that left to Ryan's head like round 2, could've hurt ryan, since his hands always drop with his chin high.
Lettsss go🇲🇽
Still winning
2:35 thanks me later
Does anyone know if floyd mayweather really bet $1.5 million on Campbell to win?
Davis thank es mucho para García
This says a lot but I don’t think he looked the greatest in this don’t think he ready for tank in any way
Wow! The golden boy almost got knocked out!! He survived, but he now knows that he can get knocked out.
Garcia needs to fight class B fighters not D
Ayo ryan learning from canelo i see him great work ryan and I hope you'll be champion for a long time
Ryan needs to stay off social media and be more in the gym with canelo
Hahahahaa that kid is trash
Tank would stop him, Lopez would hurt him, Haney would embarrass him. The young lion need to fight a few more years
Incredible fight. Kudos to both fighters. It takes a lot of hard work to get up there 💫
That body shot in slow motion 😬😬😬
Luke shouldve jumped all over garcia after that Knock down. Gave him way too easy of a way to recover.  Garcia says he wants manny tho... that chin would be gone in 2 rounds vs a 42 year old manny. Stay away from the top dogs kid for a couple more years minimum..
Garcia put everything behind that body shot
Mans rearranged his guts with a punch.💀
When he fighting tank
That was a solid fight. What a body shot
Ryan is a king no cap he got knocked down and got up and still went on
Garcia reminds me of Amir Khan but with power
Sick fight
That knockdown proved that No matter what happens to Ryan he will always find a way to bounce back like a real champion 🥊
Lo unico qe me gusto es qe lo tumbaron al perro
Yeah....he ain't ready for a power puncher like Davis
Garcia gotta keep them hands up. His first true test. Passed with a great score but saw some holes
I wanna see him fight Tank Davis
Ryan won Bc man blew out Luke’s air I bet man couldn’t breath but an amazing fight 🇲🇽🇲🇽
When does he fight gervonte
This fight looks fixed. Looks like Campbell is giving him and open look for that counter shot and Luke isn’t even doing anything.
Put some respect on his name! He might be a pretty boy and likes social media but the man can box.
He has to work on that head movement man cuz he got hit with way too many flush hooks here and if tank hits him flush ryan will get sent to another dimension
Can’t wait what Jake Paul has to say😂🤣
This was Ryan’s Mayweather fight. The rookie getting tested by the veteran. He passed the test.
And y’all said he ready for tank? Y’all goofy asl
SMH at Luke not attacking after this. 🤦🏽‍♂️ terrible. He had him.
Respetos pero Lopez is better!!!🤔👍👍 👍👍 👍
Now Ryan needs to fucken KO Jake Paul
Wow !! Congratulation Rhyan Garcia ... eres grande !
Tank ko rayan easy
OK now it's to out him in a fight  since he is being compared to ODL !
Ryan showed a lot of heart and determination but Oscar needs to keep him away from Tank! Tank will flatten him and it won't take long! Haney will outbox Ryan! Ryan needs a few more fights before he faces the top guys but he is definitely on the right track!!!!
Tank get a wide open shot like Campbell did Ryan will join Leo🙄🙄
I see him beating haney but teo and tank are still levels above him. Great fight from him tho. Apart from getting dropped in the second round, he proved that hes a top contender in the lightweight division.
WOW 🤩
It was a amazing fight!! That what I call a classic boxing match both guys did great!! Ryan prove that he is a fighter not just a pretty boy
Then: hE FiGhTs bUmS Now: hE FiGhTs oLd bUmS
That body shot was intense yo! Beautiful boxing, from BOTH of them!
he hit the liver button
Tank gone knock this fool out he better stay n his lane
He did the Canelo hook to the body. Hopefully that knockdown in round 2 humbled up Garcia 😂
Davis a different beast tho 💯
He ain't ready for Devin, Tank, Shakur, or Teo....No bro you too flat footed
When Tank & Ryan finally fight Idk who to choose 😭 Ryan needs to sharpen up his defense tho (footwork mostly his guard is solid) if Gervonta landed that lead hook that dropped Ryan I honestly don’t believe he gets up from that lol but he literally has the best training partner for it lol Canelo has the best head movement and more importantly footwork in the game now that Floyd is “retired”. Ryan showed the heart of a champion getting back up then getting the finish!
Let's gooooooooooo!!!
Loving these highlight but dislike the commentators
That left was nasty
This is the guy y'all think that would beat Devin and tank 🤣🤣🤣 lord have mercy.
Rigged fight
Dope! I'm so proud of Ryan Garcia. I wanted him to win. I would've bet against anyone that he was going to win by knockout before the 10th round.
Ryan ain't ready for tank davis. No way.
Ja ja ja ja estrella con quijada de cristal y pues el muchacho tiro un solo golpe y lo tumbo
Seeing that slo mo u can see how effectively brutal that body shot was by ryan garcia. The skin was rippling all across his body like a huge rock hitting a puddle.
I don't think Ryan is ready for "Tank Davis". He needs to improve both his defense and offence. He stands to straight and does not use a lot of head movement....
That was impressive 😳😳😳
Pretty boy proved he got a chin. Very impressive win
Luke has covid-19 and knocked out Ryan who doesn't/hasn't had covid-19. 🇺🇸👊🏻
Ryan G. has a gift. A magical left hook that will take him to greatness.
Great work for rayan
Best fight of his career thus far. He should be proud.
Can’t believe the other guy knocked out Graica
He can’t beat tank not yet at least
Ryan’s the only one getting dropped by fighters. Man’s defense is terrible and he doesn’t have the reflexes of an elite like Øscar de la hoya. Luke got caught because he got sloppy. Tank is going to make this dude cry
That body blow 🥵🥵🔥
Do y’all not see Ryan Garcia stepping on Campbell
Everyone acting like this is a positive for Ryan. Lol. This is a fight he should have won, given all his hype, but yet he almost got served by a DECENT boxer at best. This dude will get eaten alive by tank and teofino. Luke was hitting him with those lefts and body shots all night. He just got caught with that body shot that’s all. But this fight showed that Ryan is what he is. All hype. he’s 22 years old and is just now barely fighting a decent fighter. put him with the big dogs so they can make food out of him.
Garcia needs to take his time he's not ready for Davis, Lopez he needs to relax and work on his game some more there's no rush.
This ryan never beat a tank davis never
DAZN with the highlights my respect
Ja ja ja
LOMA GONNA BE SOOOOOO DISSAPOONTED GARCIA WON😂
Somebody has to knock this kid out.,.
The man is nasty gets knocked down n destroys the he hit him in that spot on his ribs 5 times before the final sixth body shot
Neta el morro este no la hace para los meros campeones
Lets go ryan
was that a liver punch or sum?
Devin Haney was sweating hard asf when Ryan called him out afterwards
Just by seeing this Ryan wasn't ready for this fight he was to afraid to go in but he always looking for the body shot next to the ribs
Stay away from tank
Did anyone notice cambull wearing Logan Paul’s socks
So we not gone talk about the hug when he won😂
Bro he gonna get killed by Tank. If Luke sent him to the floor. Tank is gonna send him to the morgue that’s facts
This just shows Ryan really needs to start fighting better boxers if he wants to ever have a serious shot at Davis or Lopez because he definitely has flaws.
Ryan has the potential to be a great world champion but he definitely has some technical issues to deal with. He has to see his opponents punches better  and not reach for them. Luke caught him because he was reaching. Ryan also has to learn to understand eddy fluently. Ryan drops his hands way too much, a teofimo or tank will make him pay severely but if he tightens things up the sky is the limit for this kid.
Showed another of heart and will.
Brutal body shot
if luke can hurt him that way then lopez or tank will likely finish him.
Fight was thrown. Can't believe the level of mediocrity i just witnessed
U gotta respect this fucken kid becoming a man in the ring wow amazing he’s not perfect his record is but I’m sure he’s going to get way better I mean way better props RYAN GARCIA fought back like a true fucken warrior
Never seen him fight before but does garcia always fight this stiff and flat footed?
Ryan can fight for sure ...where all the haters 🥸🥸
Editor and Ryan won this 🏆
He stands to straight up! He chin is always open! Campbell didnt even really try to finish him. Ryan is not ready for the top guys yet.
Right on the money, no getting up from that shot
After watching this i see a Ryan garcia getting knocked out cold by Tank
It was a great performance from both fighters 💪 Ryan got knocked down but got back up even stronger. Ryan Garcia has proved himself tonight 👏hope he works on his footwork and defense if he going to go up against Gervonta Davis. This year shows great promise for these young fighters.
Ryan garcia is fighting with a canelo style but he don't got a canelo chin
Money talks he took the fall lol.
ryan ain’t ready for tank. if davis caught him with that shot ryan would’ve stayed down
That was canelos special
I’m a Garcia fan, but Tank will shut his lights out if he lands that same shot.
Ryan really needs to work on his footwork
Ryan better learn to keep them hands up or that chin is going to get checked again, that's a bad habit to get into.
Tank is gonna walk through garcia.
Tank really hurts this guy! He won't get up from a Tank punch!
Davis or Haney will destroy Garcia
He ain’t fighting Tank no time soon..
We have yet to see the best from Ryan, by the time he's 25 he'll be a beast.
Ryan’s not ready for Gervonta lol
Speed can be power
Ryan Garcia always has my money on him! 💫🥊
2:35 fight shoulda been over 😂🤦🏼‍♂️😂
Ryan Garcia got exposed in this fight.
The commentators seem biased “the ropes kept him up” where? Lol
Ryan was being so defensive
ryan garcia defence is full of holes if he was fighting someone like loma or teofilo he would lose. he is not ready.
Yessir! King Ryan with the xome baxk
Getting dropped was probably the best thing to happen to him , he will correct that , he still young and learning from the Best .. ☠️🇺🇸 🇲🇽  got up like a man ..
Tank will make a meme outta that knock down on Ryan
ryan garcia better be lucky cambell is not a finisher because he couldve won this fight after that knock down
The kid needed a test and got one, he passed.
Campbell was saved by the bell in earlier rounds too! He got hit with a left and was clearly dazed
If Campbell had a slightly higher gear he might have won
That’s them body shot challenges he be doing
He still needs more experience before fighting Tank or even Devin Haney.
Im glad luke was able to look strong out there i personally thought he would get knocked out in the second round
It’s those body shot challenges he’s been doing 😂
The kid showed heart after being rattled, Luke let him off the hook. More vicious fighters, Tank, Devin or Shakur, would have tested him after delivering a legitimate knock down. The kid has heart & skill though.
This is a really great fight, Campbell was really technical and stayed there with him, but Garcia just leveled up while they were fighting. He turned to super Saiyan in that fight
2:38 he almost got knocked like nate  7:11 theres the knockdown
This guy thinks he’s ready for tank 😩🤣🙈
Pretty boy got the win but he got exposed.
Bro I don't blame c Campbell those liver shots hurt bad
This fight made him look more vulnerable and less invincible.
García got knockout from a nobody, Campbell didn’t have the killer instinct!
Those body shot challenges really paid off haha
Ryan had a happy new year 🎊🎆
ryan garcia no tiene nada q hacer contra tank davis ni alacran berchelt
If he doesn’t fix that head movement tank will knock his head off so he doesn’t have to
Everyone who calls Ryan overrated at this point are fake woke boxing fans😂
dammm i’m 13 an way 140 😭
Garcia ain’t ready for Tank. Period.
I think this fight is really gonna help Ryan Luke Campbell exposed some of his weaknesses and I think after this fight Ryan is gonna realize he still has a lot of work to put in
that cobra bag ain't doing shii with Ryan's head movements if he got knocked on the jaw like that.
I’ll say this....If Tank hits him with that same shot....he wouldn’t have gotten up
Just like tyson said “it’s hard to beat someone who doesn’t give up”
If I've ever seen a rigged match this is it.
Nice liver shot! 🥊
Kidney Shot.. ILLEGAL!
Tank is going to knock him out
Well I must say CONGRATULATIONS MR GARCIA.
Tanks KOs him he is pretty easy to Hit
What a fight!!!
Davis finna mess garcia up man
This fight proved two things that Garcia still has it and that he can take a fcking punch jesus
You got us in the first quarter Ryan 😅
tank is gone put that man to sleep
Ryan can not pass Keith Thurman
In regular speed that body shot didn't look like much.  But, when it's slowed down Campbells liver got sandwiched between his ribs and his spine.  Would have been amazed if he was able to get up from that.
Here come all the professional fighters to comment! 😅
Ryan getting to flat footed and no head movement.  He looks better at his last fight . Maybe a little rust since the long  Covid-19 break
This boy obviously learning some Canelo tricks,look down and finish at the top...here Ryan looked up and finished at the bottom. Classy body shot.bravo
Ryan won't have a chance against actual elite fighters 😂😂
That was a beautiful come back!
Charlie zelenoff can beats them both on the same night!
That was beautiful boxing
He has legitimate power in his hands which is a threat to any  champion in his weight class
Ryan was selling in the beginning but he T'd tf up.  Love to see it
Gervonta will take Ryan’s head off 😂🤣
Ryan was looking like nate😂👀
It’s clear Ryan has the potential to be one of the best, but he needs to work on his defense. His chin is always up and he can’t fight/ defend on his back foot.
Luke is nothing bro
That body shot was VICIOUS
Who won ??
Aight it’s time for the big fights for Ryan. I’m talking bout tank, teo, loma
Ryan  garcia is Amir kan “glass jaw”
Not impressed
Seems like someone got paid to go down in the seventh round.
W gang on deck💪🏽
7:56 that face says it all
I Wanted Ryan To Lose
Finally a toe to toe fight!!! This was awesome! Both did their best👏👏👏👏👏👊
Great K.O Chavez would be proud but kid those black dudes will mess up your pretty face just keeping it 100 💯 and im Mexican and a fan
7:32 Canelo is like, “si, yo le enseñe eso”!
He took hits and came back like a warrior 💪👑
That liver shot was perfectly placed. That would drop anyone
LETTTTSSSS FREAAKKIIINGGGG GOOO MAAANNM😈😈😈😈😈🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Gervonta too much for Ryan at this moment.  Kid needs to develop more. Nice fight!!!
Ryan Garcia haters- he won’t have my respect till he fights goku
To keep walking down someone who you know can hurt you is some crazy heart. Props to King, he made a BIG statement.
Lopez Beats everyone at 135
THAT LIVER SHOT ALWAYS BRINGS THEM DOWN ! JUST REMEMBER WITHOUT THE LIVER THE BODY CANT FUNCTION !
I feel like that knockdown only happened because he was so flat footed
Ryan me caías mal por payaso pero hoy te ganaste mis respetos y un fans
This reminded me of the video game fight night when your stamina gets regained and you come with that viscous left hook to the body. Garcia a dawg!!!!
No mames 😎😎😎😎esta perro el morro 😎😎😎🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😎😎😎🔥🔥
He gave the same body shot as canelo
why is it that when campell fought lomenchenco and lynares. he  showed much more abiliry.
Deserves a rematch.
Wow
Jake Paul try fighting Garcia and see how real boxers fight.
Tank will put that child to sleep cause the other guy cant even box
Ngl I think that was one of the worse fights but he did show some new moves but even tho in his worse he still has it soo he just needs to improve more on Canelos training and he can beat tank
That rib shot hurt me
Broken rib
Guerrero Blood
Todavía no puede con G. David.
After seeing this no doubt Ryan could take down haney
i like ryan but personally i don’t think he ready for tank or haney yet , loved the heart though
Tank and Haney going have a field day with this one 2:38 😂😂😂😂😂
2:39 Ryan falls  7:14 campbell goes down after liver punch
STEROIDS
First time I see Ryan down
Tank Davis will sleep this dude.
If Tank catches him like that he’s not getting back up. Campbell doesn’t hit like Tank.
Despite everyone saying they wanted to see Garcia prove he could beat Campbell, I love how some people in the comments refuse to give him his props. He wins a fight and their knee jerk reaction is to say “Tank would crush him”😂 It’s hilarious. These dudes are programmed to hate the guy, no matter what he does. Bouts bring some popcorn and a drink before I read comments next time😂😂😂
If he gets hit with a left like that from Tank he’s not getting back up.
Garcia will knock out gervonta davis  easy fight
So he won by a 10year difference 🤔. Not very impressive.
Great fight. Still dont think hes ready. Id say take out the top 4
Cockiness is going to ruin him
Gervonte tank Davis will put Ryan to sleep
Idk bout y’all but I think Ryan loses to tank
Gervonta Davis kills Garcia!
I think the first real knockdown garcia experiences he will never recover in boxing again.... he was just a little stunned in that fight it wasnt a dazed knockdown.
Im a Ryan fan but Luke was able to knock him down with a nice counter. If tank does that he most likely won’t get up. Still needs more work if he’s gonna be ready to fight tank.
He didn't make it through the body shot challenge 🤣😭
That was a close one ,
I like Garcia a lot however, if he wants to defeat Gervonta, he needs to improve his defense including moving to the sides and avoid jobs. He is trusting his power punches too much and almost paid the price.
Viva mexico cabrones 🇲🇽
Bunch of kids in the comment section. Don't get triggered.
I look forward to Davis vs Garcia more & more with every fight
Liver shot no doubt, has put many a man down before. Garcia showed me something tonight coming back from that knockdown. Props.
Tank for sure gives Garcia his first loss. Late round stoppage.
Bruh, how many of us were saying Ryan stands straight up... nonetheless, dude took that punch like a champ. IMO he seemed nervous knowing it was his big moment and think being lefty bothered him as well because them left hands kept landing. Great comeback though and fun fight.
Wow I'm shocked the first time ryan garcia gets knocked down
YESSIR GARCIA 🔥🐐🇲🇽
I said tbis lastnite i like all the youngstars but he will lose to all of them including rollie. Just bcux Rollies style is sum that ryan cant handle. GTD would sleep him..
He a beast but not ready for Davis he would've got up in the second round
there is going to be a lot ig replays of garcia going down
Watching RG hit the canvas was satisfying Lol
All Of Us Trainers Here In The Comments 🤙🏽
Verdejo where you at? Jk....
Ryan fell like duno and still got up 😂
Mexicans run Boxing 💯
Ry gots alot of work to do but I guess this would do ..and I'm a fan of him .. he is not ready for them big name boxers he was calling out though..
liver shot!
the ONLY problem Ryan Garcia has is that he keeps his hands down way too often when throwing a punch/combinations he needs to work on keeping them up
Ryan Garcia VS Vasyl lomachenko
Canelo teach Ryan that body punch
Ryan can’t take a left like that by Davis he’s gotta check that
And he only  going to get better
I thought Campbell could've closed it in the 2nd, but he didn't go after him after the knockdown.
The kids a beast he proved he can take a shot and come back and win it you gotta give a man his props when they dew.
ITS WHAT MEXICANS DO
Gervontae Davis would smoke Garcia. No question....
He has to improve on his defense before he fights Gervonte Davis.
Yep he broke that rib ...... that’s y I love u kid !!!!!!!!
García got exposed, he suxs  He ain’t no King
Ryan is a warrior, he got knocked down and came back 🙌
Tatiana García is the new Amir can mandíbula de cristal
Gervonta will eat this kid alive. The TANK will role over him.
I won 10k let's go Ryan!!!
Ryan please don't get caught with no shot like that when you fight tank Davis because you will not get up but I still got Ryan Garcia winning that fight win or lose I'm going with Ryan because he going to learn from that knockdown he's going to fight  a much better fight when he fight tank I think that knock down was needed to humble him and to let him know he can't run into shots when he go against tank
Luke should of left a glove loose and hit him with the palm of the hand.
Not happening against Tank! PERIOD!
At first look u think he took a dive but the replay shows that shot was deep in the body
Beasty
When Ryan got knocked down  he said ok I'm ready ok and got right back up that's is why he is one of my favorite boxers Amzing Fight Both Fighters were Amzing ✌👏😃
2:39 Garcia went from carried in with the throne to almost carried out in a stretcher!
A dog but I think Davis to much for him to more fights get his footwork down a lil more
Davis is a scaaaaary guy....
Better stay away from GTD
Head movement and the chin has to be improved then he’ll be set.
Thats my boy 🥊 RYAN GARCIA 🥊
who else was shocked when ryan got knocked down, (edit) via 2nd match
Dude got rocked, I always said he needed to be humbled. He was, and came back like a assassin. Thanks DAZN, this is what boxing is. Fathead Tank Davis is on notice.
Definitely not Ready for Tank GTFOH
You can see the he is been training with canelo with that body shot
Garcia is the real deal. Period.
Paid not to fight when we all know he was going to win
Awesome fight. Set him up with the straight hand to the body. Don't like it that Garcia keeps his hands down a lot. They always say what you do in the gym, hitting the bag, shadow boxing you do in the ring.
Matthew 3:2.
Repent Jesus Christ is coming soon.
@2:39 when Ryan got ROCKED.. Got up and won the fight
Campbell do be skippin leg day tho
I would lowkey kiss garcia
golden girl
When Luke turned his back on Ryan I knew the fight would soon be over.
Rigged !!!
He is trash. Please put him in there with Davis please.  Joke of boxing
If tank heat him with that tho night night 🙏🏾💯
And he want tank
Where the haters at?
Garcia got expose.. he got caught too many times
Come on with with this bs fight
KingRy vs. Gervonta Tank .... who yall got?
Ryan took that hook like a champ should. Get up and get that work in. He’s built for this
Crazy how Ryan was allowed to recover on purpose
If Garcia get hit like that from Tank he not getting up
Never knew Flash from Spiderman became a boxer later in life..
Round 1 Ryan Garcia Round 2 Luke Campbell(10-8) Round 3 Ryan Garcia Round 4 Luke Campbell Round 5 Ryan Garcia  Round 6 Luke Campbell  30-26 for Luke Campbell after six rounds.   Luke was outboxing and landing the cleaner punches on Ryan. A lot of Ryan's punches were blocked.   In conclusion, Ryan leaves himself too open and is a knockout waiting to happen. Javier Fortuna, Vasyl Lomachenko, Devin Haney, Javier Fortuna, Teofimo Lopez, Jorge Linares, Richard Commey, Masayoshi Nakatani and Robert Easter all beat Ryan right now.
Garcia looked human in this fight
I’d love to hear what the Ryan haters have to say now, dude finna be on top
Ryan learn that body shot from Canelo . A Great Mentor Canelo
Where’s all the Campbell fans now😂😂
1st time ryan didn’t fight any bums, and 1st ever getting knocked down.
@RyanGarcia you did it bro!! You showed up and handle business ahora calladito let’s go to the next !!!
Interesting fight now I wanna see garcia vs tank or Haney
ryan garcia had a spazz and campell had a tac... literally a bail out
Garcia already tasted the canvas. He will not go unbeaten.
I was expecting ryan to make him go night night but instead he made his liver go night night
Best-case scenario for Ryan. Overcame adversity against his best opponent to date. He's not quite ready for the top IMO but give him another year and he'll be ready.
Called it baby lets goooo
hes staying down if he was caught by Davis
Tank is not ready for Ryan I repeat tank is not ready for Ryan😈💯
21 and 0 18 by knock put
Terrible
Right now at this moment he need to stay away from Tank. If that was from Tank he wouldn’t have gotten up. His chin not so great so he need to stop mentioning tank he’s not ready for him.
Gervontai will ko Ryan
If this was ufc Ryan would have lost already.
Give the editor a raise!!!
King Ryan...Victorville California boy...i tolds you he will ko him...lets gooooo champ.....mamba4life
Devin next
1 trillion likes with tears of joy for my boy  RYAN ''THE KING '' GARCIA !  I would put up 10 g on my boy any day .. GREAT JOB ! KEEP FOCUSED ! DO NOT GET DISTRACTED !
Sooo y'all think he's ready for tank?
nah they paid him for sure
Stay away from Gervonta Davis Ryan.
I’m so invested in him b/c he’s so young & can’t wait to see him grow throughout the years as a person/boxer 🥊
Nice
I admit unlike many doubters here who just love to hate and dont give credit when it due. But Ryan shocked me by coming back after being knocked down for the first time and not feeling the pressure, instead stayed calm and proceeded to walk down Campbell down and end it with a beautiful liver shot. Hats off to my fellow latino he handled adversity and came back strong and finished the fight and silenced alot of haters. He needs work on his defense more and he will be a complete fighter. He fought a fighter who is more of a counter fighter than a fighter who comes as the aggressor and ryan doesn't like that because it's what caused him to get dropped when he's on the back foot.
Ryan garcia won cuz he hit him in the liver the liver is the most weakest spot
He not ready for Tank, not after that.
Much respect for RG but white chocolate would smoke him.
If Campbell knew how to finish a hurt man this fight would have been over in round two
Man Luke one first round
LOMA!! Why couldn’t you do that??
Revancha por qué este si es gallo felicidades al campeón pero este muchacho británico en la revancha le saca la cabeza le pasó lo mismo que a teófilo López son boxeadores de un solo golpe pero cuando los contra golpean salen mal queremos revancha por se va a poner bueno y que no sea como canelo correlon por que así es su maestro le corren a las revanchas cuando le ponen los golpes en la barba
Hajime No Garcia
That body shot had Canelos name all over it!! My guy was like this is for Canelo !! Bam! 💥💥💥🥊🥊
overall fight was 10.
Man I had Luke side
BRUH i watched this and didn’t know who won and My heart Drop when ryan got KNOCKED and i wasn’t expecting luke  to give up like that
I like the way garcia fighting style. He's fast , Powerful and take risk.  But.. that Left leg inside a southpaw stance 0:48 , 1:40 , 1:53 and of course 2:38 Down ( like he almost tripped after his own 1-2 or his lead hook ) and his Right hand Habit whenever he's trying to avoid campbell left like in ( 1:27 ) its very dangerous in my opinion. Also Props to Campbell for not being rushy after the Knockdown of Garcia.
He’s not ready for tank smh 🤦‍♂️
Congrats to Ryan that’s definitely an impressive victory, but he needs to tighten up his defense immediately. If that left was from Teofimo, Haney or Tank the fight would’ve been over.
I was just passing by i saw the arena while this was happening
Tank / will drop him. Ryan fights with his hands down & throws his punches way to wide.
Garcea not ready for tank...
Ryan is for real
LUKE KNOCKS DOWN GARCIA 2:39    You’re welcome 😇
Great fight..
Wait till he fights someone with killer instincts
I think Tank will fight him now.
He proved he got heart but still not sure he’d be able to take on tank without getting ko’d in devastating fashion
Ryan Garcia would get get KO’ed in 2 rounds by Tank Davis
Ryan did not win all those rounds
Not a fan of Garcia.
Garcia definitely needs to work on his foot work
Holy cow.........
Oooh🙆🏽‍♂️ that liver shot don't play games💀. Go García!!
oh yeah if ryan fights teo or tank hes gonna lose with by getting knocked out
Idk but refery just said 7 i think
That liver blow was crazy accurate
Ryan keep gervonta name out yo mouth you to little💯
He did knock out some of Garica cockyness though lol
Ryan could survive Devin's pillow hands, but he's getting knocked out against teofimo or tank.
Lol and these fan boys think he has a chance against Tank Davis 😭😭😭😭
The announcer couldn't have been more wrong lol. Cambell if anything looked afraid after he knocked down garcia 😂
I’ve been saying he always drops his right hand every time he goes for a jab or lead left hook he can’t keep that right hand up
Wow amazing!!!
Ryan got dropped. Lol
Garcia needs to improve head movement significantly!
Garcia ain’t ready for Tank
Ryan clearly isnt ready for tank but doesnt mean he won't be he still young and has some developing to do , the fight that needs to happen is tank vs teofimo now thats a fight everyone will pay to watch 100%
That looks like Canelo’s move. Fake to the top and hit the body and vice versa.
No head/foot movement and poor overall defense
Ooh wee, Ryan Garcia can falt out box! The lightweight Division is deep. It's getting interesting.
Let’s gooooooo yeahhhhhh 🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🔥🔥🔥🔥🥳🥳🥳🥳💯💯that’s my guy
😂😂😂broke the internet wit this
His defense definitely is lacking he literally puts zero effort into defense actually and it is crazy to me because he is literally training side by side with Canelo’s team which is all based on defense I wouldn’t be surprised if he improves a lot in that aspect before he fights tank Davis cuz honestly tank can take a punch Ryan can’t and that’s what comes down to it in my opinion
Give ryan his respect. no matter his beginnings. R.G. is definitely going places.
He not ready for TANK
Garcia ain’t got no work😂
"The truth" 🙌 Ryan got hit so well, he fell like puppet 🤣
I like luke knockout thn Ryan Garcia
The thing is Tank hits a lot harder and Campbell so he definitely needs at least 2 years before taking him on
Teo and Tank are going to tenderise García. He showed a lot of heart thou.
Put some respect on my name
They better keep Ryan away from Tank. Are it’s going to be night night.
I give this match a 10 out of 10
anybody u see bounce back up from a knockdown like that is juiced to the gills my guy
DAZN Plese give that editor a RAiSE!!!! Wow!!!!!
Heart of a champion
Luke isn't even elite level & rocked.Gracia 😂😂😂😂 Haney,Lopez, Loma Or Davis Would Smoke Him
Garcia getting knocked down will do him more justice moving forward in his young career.  Now he knows that’s a feeling never to be felt again, but to learn from.  Great work
2:40 That KO was awesome 👏
Devin Haney would destroy Garcia in 6 rounds or less
Should throw that hook to the body more often...NASTY PUNCH
Everyone forgeting that the bell saved luke cambell, he almost  got knocked out
I thought Ryan’s legs were gone, He’s a warrior
THE LIVER SHOT!!!!! I KNEW IT WAS OVER.  Unstoppable
Ryan needs more work on his foot work and defense before he can call out any one else in the boxing game. He is not Ready for Teofimo and not ready for Gervonte Tank......not dissing or knocking his game but it still needs more work with Eddy and Canelo
Notiene estilo. Presumido y nada de humildad  y  golpea. A lo pendejo
Ryan really need that punch 🥊 so he can put his feet back to the ground
Why didn’t Campbell get after him after knocking him down??? Props to Ryan for going the distance tho if he keeps improving the futures looking bright
A huevos que si /🇲🇽
Didn’t mayweather bet on this match?
Ajaja bien higadeao🤣😂
The Boy has been exposed, and needs to keep Gervonta Davis name out his mouth.  If he can't take a punch from him....He expect to take one from Gervonta...Man stop....
Instant liver failure. Micky Ward would be proud.
Keep on winning and getting those KO's, Ryan. You'll need them in order to make a future fight with Teofimo look more and more lucrative.
He’ll be a beast if he learned great head movement.
People are talking about the knockdown, but there were flaws all over tonight. I watched the entire fight. He was always dropping his hands, Luke was rocking his head back with every straight or jab he threw because this clown has no head movement. He has no footwork and is always flat footed winging shots and when he gets you on the ropes he smothers his own power shots. He gets stopped by Lopez, Loma, Tank, or Haney probably by a few other dudes actually because Campbell is a few levels below all of those guys and he was having way too much trouble with him.
Im glad Ryan Got KO maybe he can humble himself down 😎
I don't care what anyone says. Ryan is going to be a problem. He might have took a shot to the jaw and got knocked down but it didn't really daze him. This kid got power behind those punches. It already shows! Just look at what he did to campbell. If you can knock down someone with a body shot, imagine if that was towards the noggin.
Respect! Ryan got knocked and still got up and got that W
Ryan vs tank... just realized floyd called tank the future and is on his side but Ryan got canelo
He want to fight Tank 😅🤣😅🤣😅 ninja please
People posted this ALL over til tok but just the ryan knock down yall haters need to give Ryan the respect he deserves 👍💪
Nice Job to Ryan, he made a mistake early but fought back like a real Champion. That hook to rib looked very painful, Ryan really put everything in that shot and it landed just at the right spot. Luke was a great opponent for Ryan, he is young and still has a lot to learn.
This was rigged !
Yeah after seeing Luke drop Ryan.... I don’t think Ryan wants smoke with Gervonta at ALL🤣🤣🤣
MARQUEZ ALWAYS GOT DROPPED N CAME BACK STRONGER ITS WHAT U DO  AFTER U GET DROPPED THAT DEFINES IF UR A TRUE CHAMP OR NOT
Wonder what the haters have to say now lol King Ryan proving them wrong
If that was tank wit that shot he took game over buddy
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 ORDINARY!!!
Ryan Garcia is flashy and quick but he needs to learn how to anticipate the hits or just learn how to block. He got caught with both his hands stretched out like he trying to push someone away. That will get him straight K Oed if he were to fight someone with a harder hit.
Mucho ruido y pocas nueces garbonta o teofimo estarían bien para García esa sería una buena prueba para el
Garcia needs to keep his chin down, Tank would KO him.
Fighting cab drivers
Daaaang!
That’s right my boy on ur way to greatness
The only reason I didn't like Ryan was because he goes along with what jake paul does
Wonderful,  Garcia not have protect.
Respect to ryan, after he goes against one of the top dogs in the game his first L will come with that
Luke should retire he just lose to someone who doesn’t know to step to the outside of the foot when fighting a southpaw
The commentators where hyping way to fast after Luke brought Ryan down. WAY TO FAST,   PD: Love Canelo’s support to his country teammate.
Campbell was surprise to see Ryan get back up after that knock down. You can see it from Campbell face expression. Respect to both fighter ✊
He just proved he better leave Tank alone cause he will NOT get up once Davis touches him! 💯
When Luke dropped Ryan I got a little scared
Campbell should of not let off when he put Garcia down!
He Definitely not ready for tank 😭😂
Fight
Kingry made that liver jiggle!!!!! Awesome finish!!
Lunch for Loma, Tank and Lopez
Ryan looks nice,,,,but u cant get caught flush by the slow hands of luke Campbell who made this a great fight....wen u think of ryan u think of tank, and haney, and Stevenson,,,,after watching this fight he is to open to be hit and would lose to all 3.....facts....and I really like ryan, because he's gonna bring the fight to u...
Told ryan he had this foght
Luke wasn't asking himself if he wanted to get up? His body was not responding. You can see he was struggling to take air in. I like Ryan, and I believe he has the goods to become a world champ, but he needs to work on his waist movement, footwork, and head movement. I would also include feints. I know Eddie Reynoso is too talented of a trainer to not be covering this in the gym. Ryan needs to trust that he has the best corner in the world right now. When he listened to his corner, things were going beautifully.
Tank would destroy this kid 🤭
Anyone think Ryan Garcia has a chance against Lomo?
This little hype train, Garcia best keep padding his record with journey men, he want be a champion any time soon
I dont think hes ready for tank davis not yet he needs to pace himself i see him getting knocked out if he doesnt work on his defense.
2:40 2021 to Ryan Garcia. “It’s a New Year Ryan! Time to fight the Big Boys.”
Garcey is no match for gervontae
Ryan Garcia: so this Is what a shot of humbleness tastes liiiiiiikeeeeeee???  Floor: yes, your welcome!!!!!!
Ryan better go watch some Salvador Sanchez tapes and learn about defense and footwork
This fight was paid to win. Come on he even hesitated before he took a knee. Honestly was expecting a better KO win From king ry.
Great finish. Highly suspicious post fight celebration.
Here we go with the Euro Excuses Im getting so tired of them
Don’t think Logan/Jake would want any of Ryan....
I hope that left hook humbles Garcia bc if he keeps doin what he’s doin the next left hook is gonna come from a banger and he’s not gonna shake that one off so easily.
Yeah Luke can’t fight! I want to see him fighting a real fighter...
RYAN'S TO FLAT FOOTED AND DOESN'T MOVE HIS HEAD. HIS POWER IS MAKING HIM A LITTLE LAZY.
This dude can't beat tank
This kid is nowhere near ready for gervonte this looked like a rookie golden gloves fight
He should have went for blood after that knock down
Dude took a dive.
Tank vs Garcia super fight PPV
JESUS LOVES YOU!!! He loves you so much that He hung on a cross and took upon Himself all the sins you would ever commit, the question now is “Do you love Him”? How do you genuinely show your love to someone? What is the greatest showing of love? The answer is sacrifice and then time. Jesus Christ paid the cost for us, through His sacrifice on the cross that we may live a life of health, deliverance and prosperity. How can you pay Him back? You can pay Him back through spending time with Him, thanking Him for the privilege of seeing another day, and by reading His word “The Bible”. He offers you the free gift of eternal through having a relationship with Him, and partaking in this relationship immensely benefits you . He protects, guides, provides, heals, delivers, prospers, blesses you, and so much more. A true, authentic relationship involves communication on both sides. Jesus Christ is often taken for granted, many don’t give Him the slightest of acknowledgement, regardless He is still merciful and loving. Seek Him, acknowledge you’re a sinner, lost without Him and destined for destruction, REPENT, believe in your heart wholeheartedly what He did for you on that cross and His resurrection. Confess with your mouth that He is Lord, and you’ve taken your first steps on that straight and narrow path to eternity in heaven with Him. And in this process your life will never remain the same, He will give you the Holy Spirit and grace, which will transform you and enable you to overcome sin, temptations and addiction and live a life that shows your love for Him. Slip ups happen, no one is perfect, but through asking for forgiveness and  by His grace it will occur less and less. And you will enjoy pleasing Him and living a righteous life. You have everything to gain in Jesus Christ. Have a blessed day!!
Ryan es bueno pero no superará a canelo ya lo tumbaron y a canelo no
😂😂😂and hake thinks he can beat ryan
Tank will stretch Garcia if he fights the same way.
Campbell skippin leg day
That canelo hit tho
Boxing fans wanna see tank vs garcia Garcia fans don't wanna see that fight we think it's too soon.
Garcey looks slow to me
Im glad Ryan garcia won my favorite  boxer team Ryan shock the world
Tank is way overrated yea Ryan is not there yet 2 more years and no one will touch this kid.
Why pay for PPV when this is free? 😂
All the top names in the division are hittable, expect devin. When your body is on a 90 and you take 3 steps back on every punch. Boring
Idk Rick......
Scared Ryan out lol
Campbell could have won that fight imo. Its easy for me to say but I think he gave Garcia a bit too much respect. Garcia was flat footed and there for the taking.
Congratulations Garcia!! got down in 2 rd got up like Tito Trinidad and win by tko Ryan!! 🤠💪👏👏👏👏
Ryan Garcia is TRASH
Tank would rock Garcia’s chin, Ryan better not continue asking for it...
Everyone keeps saying he has ❤️ true, but he needs to keep the cockiness down a bit CONFIDENCE, DETERMINATION should be on point not the showboating cause that punch at 2:40 rock his life right before his eyes,
Ryan really REALLY needs to work on his defensive movement ASAP or he will get in trouble fast, but hopefully canelo's team will help with that.
Took the dive...
kinda felt bad for campbell
I'm happy he won but I'm also happy he got dropped wait till tank get hold of him
2020 reminding us to not get comfortable bc you get 🤪🥊 Body Rocked , last year was covid , This year shake it off and keep going ! Finish the fight!
He won’t get up from a tank shot
7:10, Garcia thought that was cute, and delivered his own
Ryan can’t beat tank right now only persons that can are LOMACHENKO AND TEOFIMO
Garcia is Gar Bash
Stay away from tank period
Garcia has what it takes baby!
I was iffy about this Ryan kid but man! Shout out to him.. boy came back from a bad knock down he got my respect
Garcia won by TKO but that KO just exposed him. All hype.
The punch Ryan got hit with is a KO punch. He needs to be more aware and keep his hands up because if he fights someone with power he will be sleeping after that punch. Don't even mention Tank lol
He have no chin tank would knock him out and Lopez
Ryan got knocked out... he was out before he hit the ground..  he woke up on the canvas and had to figure out what just happened quick..  a champion isn't someone that always just wins..  a champion is someone that when you get him down, gets up and comes at you with everything he's got..  he pushes past any fear and finds a way to win..  Ryan has the heart of a champion...
This fight answered all i needed to know Ryan would definitely get Ko'ed By Tank Davis no question about it and he would definitely get out boxed by Devin Haney..🤣🤣🤣
Love him or hate him, Ryan faced adversity and pulled through like a true fighter. Props to him.
Ryan is still raw definitely not ready for teofimo or tank.. Should fight haney first
Juan Garcia ain't ready for Devin Haney or gervonta Davis
Its crazy these guys are 135 pounds I'm 5'10 and weigh 195 lol
Garcia literally called the body shot.
That body shot was devastating.  His entire insides just turned off
I hope people understand what this Garcia kid is missing...Feet. Fast hands, accurate and some grit. No foot work. Same thing that Canelo struggled with in the Floyd fight. Stay away from the Elite in the Mayweather camp. Got to dance in there. Kid needs a lot of work.
The more I see Ryan fight, the more I laugh at Devin Haney's skills.  🤣🤣
The body shot challenges paid off 😂😂😂
Commentator: Who thought you that body shot?  Ryan: Canelo did! Canelo: He applauds, I thought you well. 🤣👏
I wanna know how much they paid Luke to take a dive??? Ryan was getting his A** WHOOPED!!!!
what a loser.  going down after that?
Ryan is definitely great.. but man sometimes.. you just gotta calm down but lets goo
He got knock down first time and he still won canelooooooo viva mexico like the comment
Garcia is Amir khan 2.0
buena pelea se vio real
Work on your defense young man you have a glass chin
Ryan did prove himself, but Campbell did expose Ryan...a lot of work Ryan still has to do, always drops his hands or extends them out. Work on defense and ring generalship.
This just makes me wanna see Ryan vs Tank even more. I still give the edge to Gervonta tho!
Reta ese morro canelo si le ganas mis respetos .pero si sigues peleando con puros  biejitos y costales  es q eres culonsote de amadre  ay chanzas de q si te autenombres como el mejor .pero te vas x lo más fácil
if garcia and tank fight it will be on showtime
Thank you Ryan!!! you are the King!!!!!
He can’t do that with Davis because he will be sleeep
That liver shot did not look strong but when the replay happened I instantly changed my mind 👍🏽
THROWN FIGHT.  Boxing is a joke
Kid has heart.   He came back strong.
Is it just me or did I see alot of shxt Ryan needs to improve on in this fight? I feel like a fighter like Tank would expose him quickly.
Listen .... he not getting up if Tank hit him like that...we all know this
Ry still hasn’t been tested
Luke did it .. estilo CANELO!!!💪💪💪😀
He’s not ready for Tank or Devin.
THE KID JUST PULLED OFF A JUAN MANUEL MARQUEZ TYPE OF PERFORMANCE, ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED!!??
Creo que le falta como mitad para ser un buey boxeo
After watching this fight, I think Ryan should hold on to his rhetoric about Tank, he needs more fight experience with a southpaw.
He fought 33 year old man!
He the real deal
OUUUUU NICE KNOCK DOWN ON BOTH FIGHTERS but this might be bad for ryan career because his future opponents will start focusing on that chin
Ryan not ready for davis
After a knock down and still able to punish his opponent. Champion 🥊
Tank will put Ryan to sleep if he connects him the same way. He ain’t getting back up. But overall I’m a Garcia fan and I will be rooting for him when they fight.
That was an amazing fight had me wowed
Is it just me or did Luke Campbell’s face look surprised when he knocked Ryan Garcia out? 🤔 as if he wasn’t supposed to do that lol, just looked rigged to me 🤷
Showed a lot of heart to fight back from that KD. I'd still like to see him fight Haney first, then Tank, then Teo.  And I'd like to see some head movement and more lateral movement from Ryan as well. But he's young and has a high ceiling, so all of that will come eventually.
Couldn't handle this guy how can he go against tank 🤣
Man... K everybody talking about how much heart he has but his timing is nice.
Don't hate Ryan but that was a lackluster performance against a mid-level opponent , hope this fight was a major eye opener , for his coaches and Golden boy staff , im sure they realize calling out Gervonta Davis is the wrong call , but he came out with the W. Congrats . Needs ton of training for somone like tank or loma
If Ryan can get that Canelo head movement, he'll be unstoppable. 💯
and people were doubting him bruh🤦🏽‍♂️let's go ryan 🇲🇽 ❗❗❗
Ryan just needs to focus more on his defense and learn to pick his shots better.
Y’all crazy if you thinking he ready for Tank after this. Poor footwork and no defense at all. He has ALOT of work to do to be ready for Tank or Haney
Ryan garcia is not the future has way too many flaws.
All the haters for Ryan gonna be quiet now😂😂 all the haters saying your woried about the wrong ring but who won now
Amazing fight💯👌🏿
KING RYAN GARCIA❤️👑
Heart of a champion
He got potential to be dangerous lol
Beautiful body shot
kid has heart! This fight was the perfect learning lesson for him and its great it came so early in his career. Ryan is LEGIT
Who else is watching in 2021
Luke was like a banana !
Dope fight
Que bonitos vergazos así deben de ser el box puro titán contra titán 🥊🥊
Ala canelo!!!
A FUTURE MILLIONAIRE WILL LIKE THIS COMMENT
This kids the truth...
Koodos to Ryan but he wouldn’t beat Tank. Ryan should be dominating fights in order to fight Davis
Say listen here, Ryan showed true grit tonight, but for him to say he's ready for tank is Bonkers yes I said Bonkers. If he got dropped by Campbell how will he fair against Gervonta's punching power. He's got to Up his defense, a lot before he's ready.
I bet you most of these people wanted Ryan to lose and say he only fights scrubs
Imagine if that was Tanks left....
Ryan garcia displayed great  character
He still ain’t beating tank
Hate this punk social media kid but you know what? He's going to be a champion and here for a long time. He's the real deal, only going to get better, and that's the truth.
That body shot did not look very comfortable
LATINO POWER. LETS GOOOOO
This man can’t box
Ryan got no chin
I just found out Luke Campbell is 33
Wow great fight ryan
This knock down reminds me of marquez ‘s over hand right that knocked down paquiao down in the 3rd round in their 4th fight. Ryan fell down the exact same way. Got up quickly as well. It was just a wake call. He needed that to get humbled a bit and take this fight more serious. GREAT FIGHT OVERALL.
I'm with Garcia 100%, but those DAZN commentators were bias A.F!
This guy wants to fight Teo?
Shout out to dazn for that quick upload.
Well this went exactly how I though it would. Almost. Didnt think he would stop him.. So that is impressive. He not ready for Tank though, not with that chin or defense. I hope he dont fight him next, I wanna see his defense improve a lil more first. NICE WORK GARCIA. NICE WORK.
tonight made me believe ryan garcia would get knocked out by every top level fighter in his division . he has a glass jaw
Very boring boxing. Ryan the ducker
Imagine getting knocked down in a fight VS Luke Campbell and calling out Tank 🤦🏻‍♂️😂 brooooo you couldn’t handle that punch
True warrior!
🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
When he face an elite fither ,for sure he'll be knock out
La de canelo
cambell slammed a body shot to ryan and he took it and then ryan hit him with one straight after and he went down
Fix fight
I like the kid. He should avoid Devon Haney at all cost. Ryan has too many defensive flaws. Haney in  eight.
That liver shot shut him down
When watching the fight I remember thinking right before Luke dropped him that Garcia is underrated . Like he may be the best prospect of the bunch in natural talent. He may lack the refinement of Shakur Stevenson , Devin Haney or Teofimo Lopez but in hand speed and power he is up there.
Whatttyy they already. I thought it was tonight. Like at 9pm
Devonta will ko Garcia
Dazn be quick with the highlights
He snuck that hook right to the body...ouch
Not impressed. Youth versus age. Let's see youth against youth. Skill versus skill. Give the boxing fans great fights!!!!
Liver shot never fails ! The victim takes a knee the same way every time
Oscar better tell Ryan to close his mouth when it comes to Tank. As of right now he is not ready. Not enough head movement. He will not get up if Tank hits him flush like that. Night Night!! Nice comeback though!!
Stay away from tank
Garcia...... Is nothing special..... Sorry..... Tank would make easy work of em......
Peace, Much respect to both fighters.  Shots like both fights took, take years of a fighters life and are ingrained into the muscle memory of a fighter...to what extent is the only question?...Peace.
After the knockdown Campbell should've put the pressure on but why didn't he cause he got paid to lose
Ryan proved he has a Chin  yes he has to improve.  But the importan part is the Win  Mexican Blood all day 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽 viva Mexico 🇲🇽
Shawdy not ready for Haney or tank
Pinche suertudo 😂
Este garcia Debera  de  dejar de ser famfaarron  para seguir siendo campeon  esta vez fue suerte   si sigue  asi de mamon  uno mas chico  de eatatura  lo va a noquear  le falta apeender  mas y  cuidarse mas  pero que deje de ser creido  y echador
If your a Garcia fan your impressed.but dude dropping Garcia looked way doper...made me feel all warm inside 😬
Luckily ryan is only 22 years young, was able to get right back up and fight after that knockdown 💯💯
Garcia will destroy Davin Haney!
Ryan great job let your haters be your motivators you still young keep doing you 🥊 great win 👍
Ryan wouldn't come back up after a teofimo or gervonta nockdown
Ryan wanna fight tank huh 🤔 luke knocked him down tank gonna knock him out it’s a difference in tank power 😂😂
I think Ryan beats tank because he’s the much bigger guy, but I don’t see him beating Haney
He ain’t gettin up from noTank hit sorry lol 😂
The body shot challenge 😂
RYAN IS A MONSTER!!!!!
'oh my lord' snoop
Petition for DAZN to get new boxing commentators .    These guys are trash 🗑 . Get some real fighters to commentate . Who know what they’re talking about
GARCIA IS NOT READY FOR TANK
Incoming Jake Paul Video of him wanting to fight Ryan 💀💀💀
Ryan couldn't knock him out. Luke won
Looks like a snack for tank lol.
He learned that from Canelo,Canelo does it to perfection though
Wow.... AMAZING FIGHT TO START 2021 !!!
García still got a long way to go, not ready for TANK D, Not at all!!!
He has a lot of work to do. He is too one dementia all he throws 1/2 punches at a time and takes big shots. He’s not ready for the big 3 at 135. But he earned my respect.
Campell body shots ryan: Ryan: okay, my turn
Where the haters at 🤣
the new king Ryan Garcia
The beauty of this fight was Garcia hit him with the exact same punch he hit him with lol
I am a fan of Garcia.  He is not ready yet. Still got some learning to do. Better defense with some movement. His chin is going to be an issue as he steps up in competition...  I still like him tho
Davis would have slept him
Respect the step up. He looked cool. I think he could beat Haney, but Tank would give him problems. His shots are pushing almost like he’s loading up or telegraphing his punches, and he needs to tighten up his defense. Teofimo probably would stop him though.
That was a peak of what a champion does!! King Ryan is getting ready !
Mad props to Garcia took it on the chin went down stayed with the fight
Ryan is a dog but he has to work on head movement and not exposing his chin Tank would of stopped him with that shot
Wow.    That body shot was fast and on point.   LETS GO RYAN
Hopefully he (Garcia) watches his mouth now and works on his craft.  No way he survives against the better fighters in the division.  Oscar was right he's not ready yet.  Get off Social media kid and stay off.
Ryan is #1
This was definitely a mis match I want to see him vs the tank
THE BEST BODY SHOT FOR 2021
Campbell kept going to the body with no set-up punch. Garcia read this, and tried one of his own straight to the liver. Impressive
García proved that he is a fighter, not ready to be a world champ just yet but he will be soon
8:05 that was like Ryan’s 3rd body shot he threw in the fight and won 😂
whats up with the brits and their weak bodies ?? first Canelo puts smith down with a body shot.. now this brit goes down the same way ?? lol
Ryan the real deal
The fight was bought lol
This is a great milestone win congratulations 🍾 now your fight career starts
Ryans goated
but fr tho the bell saved Luke’s life
WOW  NOT. TANK NEXT!
He still needs more time,head movement, accuracy, ring IQ.not ready for tank ,devin,or Shakur
Taaaaaank, come out and playyyaayyy Taaaaaank, come out to plaaaayyaayy Taaaaaaaaaaaaank, come out and plaaaaayyyaaaayyyyy _warrior's
That body shot was a Canelo style Liver punch.
Lol they were talking about feet I look down next thing you know I see Garcia where his foot was 😂😂😂😂
most people think this is ryan proving himself or whatever and while that’s half true if he got knocked down by that punch tank would destroy him he shouldn’t take tank yet he ain’t ready
Ryan Garcia is as legit as it gets, really thought Luke would win, but Garcia never gave up, great fight
his best fight yet really proved himself 🤝
Canelo left hook
ryan is getting big, i remember a few years ago this kid looked like a 12 year old girl
Honestly I give the kid an A for heart but this fight definitely exposed him and showed that he isn’t anywhere close to the other fighters in the top.......
Ryan's speed makes him a beast
It reminded me of that Liam Smith vs Canelo body shot.
GERVONTA  VS  RYAN
Man Ryan proved himself this fight amazing resilience after getting knocked down I wonder what the doubters gonna say this time around
Like in the hollywood movies baby👊👊👊.
The way Garcia set that body shot was beautiful. He got hit with one that I thought was gonna hurt him then immediately goes for his revenge body shot putting so much torque into it and securing the finish. LOVELYY!
Anyone can be champ if the fights are paid off
so much for paying to see this, everyone gets it free half an hour later
Great fight was hoping for a different outcome... Maybe that left humbled Garcia a touch!
you guys are easily impressed
That’s a brilliant shot. Wow.
Ryan Garcia Greatest comeback
That was sick🔥
That boy would’ve been sleeping if teo or tank hit him like that in round 2.
No creo que la quijada de este morrito aguante un golpe del Tanke Gervonta
Luke can't fight to soft got no jab
Luke didn't fixed i!
Why was this fight so special not only was a star born on this  day he got hurt and dropped and recovered and won. That means he will be something special in the future bet
They both weaki gave garcia a pass cause he was young but i see no improvement
0.25 speed at 7:38 Crazy
You can see the influence canelo's definitely going for the body a lot more
Go Ryan garcia
Paid to knee down 🤣🤣
Got my sub great channel
Tank, Lomo, Teofimo are better fighters than Garcia. However if the kid works on defense n don’t be so easy to let them hands go irresponsible he has a chance to be better than them all
Haney  would smesh  ryan.  Dont shoot the messenger.
Garcia got that nate diaz/Andy Ruiz chin lol
Can’t count Ryan out let’s go !
Who else was shocked when Ryan got knocked down.
I said it Ryan Teofimo and Mungia been laying everyone out.
When u make some one quit with a body shot that's a big statement ry is a hard and fast puncher look out everyone he will be a champ soon watch
Ryan Garcia is the future of boxing. Best believe !
He was definitely paid off
That body shot was nasty
I’ve learned one thing from this fight. Ryan Garcia is not ready for Davis.
2:39 Ryan showed that he can take a punch to the jaw 💪🏿
Garcia getting knocked down was scary
Ryan wack, proved he’s got heart also proved his chin made of glass as I knew it was . He won’t be the next Oscar or Canelo . They never got rocked like that... let’s be honest
Tik Tok kids winning today
What happens when you act tough someone has to snap you back into reality  n be more humble
Won't take anything away from Ryan but dang he really needs to work on his footwork. He's relying too much with his left hook. A more explosive with a footwork and experience will give him a lot of problem. Wasnt really impress woth this win. Seems like he got worse under Canelo's team. Congratz either way.
Eso era faltaba pegarle los ganchos buen resultado Ryan García...
The fight was over in the 4th,Campbell said no more but the bell saved him.
Garcia demostro q tiene lo q se necesita...pantalones!! Y eso es muy normal q suceda cuando enfrentas a rivales d categoria y q van a presentar pelea. Esta clase d peleas, son las q t hacen crecer como pugilista. Estoy seguro q Garcia aprendio mas en esta pelea, q en el total d las q llevaba hasta el dia d hoy. Este es boxeo real, ni las pantomimas q hace el mejor "bolseador" del mundo, kkanelo. En peleas reales, cualquier cosa puede suceder. En los teatros mal montados, en las funciones d circo d la diva d rojo, in hecho como este, jamas se presentara. A eso ponganle la firma.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Muy bueno Rayn,como se recuperó del golpe,Felicidades Mijo
LETS GOOOOOOOO
Ryan needs to study defense alot of head movement and footwork.The kid has heart but a heavy hitter could catch him first. I am happy and proud of him and his development.He proved old media wrong Congrats DAZN. GREAT FIGHT.
He won’t beat the top fighters after this
Took a left from Luke a left from Tank will be the end of the flash 📸
Sorry he not ready for tank
La verdad
Are him and gervonta Davis in same fight weight?
Yo did anyone’s heart sink when they saw Ryan get dropped
Sorry for my inglis 🤦‍♂️💪👍
Much Respect for getting right back into it after being knocked down.
I feel like Ryan was a lil cocky in this fight, if he had better defense that knock down would’ve never happened
Way to go KingRy!
Garcia needs ALOT of work. ESPECIALLY in the footwork and keeping his head off the centerline. He needed to keep his lead foot on the outside of Campbells lead foot and basically didnt do that at all. It was driving me crazy! Didnt suprise me at all when he got knocked down. He also he may have a glass jaw.  The future will tell no doubt about it
22 year old manny would stop Garcia in 5 or less
I'm sorry but Ryan has some ippo in him
Yea..tank devin or shakur by knockout
Davis would hurt him bad
Ryan showed a lot but Tank would probably knock his head off
KINGRY RULEZ...AWESOME COME BK !!
That liver shot in slow motion was brutal
This kid proves ppl wrong every time he’s a true demon 🐐
No way he survives a shot like that from TANK
2:38 he felt the power of twisted tea
He just realized he have to box more beside to try to show off to the people he have to concentrate more in what he do(box) besides what to show to the fans.I hope he learn his lesson with this chata because the other they not gona give him a chance to recuperate and finish the round. He don't have no chance with the big guy's.
And mfs are still gonna hate 😐
Great fight, loved every moment of it. Luke was a beast, Ryan fought back like a beast. Congrats to Ryan.
RYAN GARCIA SOY TU SEGUIDOR ..PERO HOY NO LA TENIAS FACIL... SABES SI NO TE PONES LAS PILAS Y NO ENTRENAS MAS DURO Y ESA DEFENSA Y Y MAS CAVESEO.... SABES TE VAS A METER EN PROBLEMAS CON CON GERVANTO DAVIS.
I'm a fam of Garcia but I'm a fan of Tank more. tank will hurt that boy he  better try Devin 1st. tank just has that mike an wilder power in both hand an the angles he can throw punches at is crazy
a canelo knockout💪🏽
For the RAZA 🇲🇽 ‼️‼️‼️‼️
Nice fight but he's not ready for tank
Keep him away from Tank I don’t think he’s ready just yet.
Garcia put Lukes  ribs all on one side.
If Tank lands the same left that  Campbell did Garcia will not get up. But the Tank v Garcia fight probably won't happen.
Once a pusi boi always a pusi boi
That’s a nice win. Especially to come back from off the canvas.
His not ready for Davis. Tank have that heavy hand.
If that left hand by Campbell was thrown by tank Ryan would’ve been lights out
Tank will knock Garia into next week, quick.
Yea Campbell took a liver shot, that can easily be someone's undoing if they get hit hard enough
Tank Davis by round 6 KO
Garcia still leaving his chin way up in the air... Tank Davis is going to be licking his chops when they meet
He had lighting in his arm on that body shot that ended it.
Ryan gotta stop fighting so str8 up and down. Chin up in the air like the speed bag.
Great fight
Tank will destroy Garcia. I feel sorry for when Garcia fights Stevenson, Haney & Teofimo.
I agree with money Mayweather.  He needs to keep tanks name out of his mouth!!!
Talk about Text book how to promote a young fighter even after a huge scare.  And at 6:47 the commentator talking about Campbell needing to 'stop PRESSURIZING garcia'. Funny term to use. Lol
This kid has a ❤.👊
It was a hard hit .. but I think he definitely took the bag to let Ryan win 🤷🏽‍♂️ Garcia still fish food to Tank so idc lol
Let’s see if Oscar really think Ryan walks through tank and makes that fight next
It should ve called "fightlights" instead of "fight high lights"
He has fast hands with no footwork or head movement. He'll do great if he fights other flat-footed fighters that are not athletic
Ryan better stay away from tank. If he gets hit by tank he’s not getting up. Defense has to improve
Just keep Ryan away from Tank last time I checked Mayweather schooled Canelo...
Lol I weight the same as Ryan but he punches like he was twice my weight
Huge respect to Ryan future champ and respect to Luke it an amazing fight. Ryan’s knockdown either gonna make him stronger or show vulnerability, and thats UP TO RYAN. Happy New Year y’all
The heart of a champion is always there response to adversity. King Ry stays undefeated. Great fight
He wasn't hurt, just surprised.
Aterrizaron sl disque Rey le falta mucho si pelea contra teofimo o gerbonta lo despedasan que se baje de la nuve
Ryan no match for tank
Everyone talking about Davis power but Campbell said garcia is the hardest puncher he’s ever faced after the fight. Either way Davis vs garcia need to get made.
Luke pulled a canelo
Respect to Garcia but I don’t see him beating tank, tank is smart and has tricks and traps set for you and Garcia can easy fall for them. Garcia sometimes thinks he has the opponent hurt and loses his minds and swings and forgets to protect his jaw and more..stuff tank can easily capitalize on
Ryan is another made up boxer just used as a cash cow and once he fights someone decent he will get ko’d.
They started the year with probably one of the best fight I've seen in awhile.
Idk man.. what if they threatened kampbell if he won his fam at risk or sum
Love this kid. But he better stay away from tank tho
Haney vs Ryan needs to be next no cap it would be a incredible fight tbh
Rip James we miss you
Now I'm really worried about the gervonta davis fight. It's gotta happen eventually 😬
He not ready for Tank Davis.
Ne not ready for Tank Davis.
Tank Davis will destroy Garcia. He just showed it
Davis struggled with Santa Cruz and Ryan struggled with Campbell so I think they are both ready for each other
For his next fight he needs to really learn to protect his chin
Ryan vs Haney baby lets goooooooo it’s gotta happen now
Bro and Jake Paul wants to fight this legend
Not impresse. Got hit too much.  Overrated
Got goosebumps just watching the highlights
This is fight was great for boxing
Tank would break this kids neck with that left uppercut
Bitter sweet fight for all the black boxing fans 😉
What's up with Ryan wrapping his legs around grown men?
That was quick for the highlights
Lol the fans who only root for Tank Davis, Devin Haney, Shakur Stevenson, and believe Tyson Fury cheated Wilder are hating like no other after this fight lol! Oh well who needs them, the AAC was still rocking without them.  Great win Ryan!
Campbell should have went crazy after knocking him down Garcia obviously doesn’t want to lose can’t let him recover it may be risky but Ryan isn’t comfortable with a lot of pressure
When Ryan got hit for a split second I thought it was going to be over but as soon as I seen him hit the floor and get up I knew he was about to come back hard
Gavonte Davis is like ill knock that kid out
Listen I  called it from day 1..hes got a lil ways 2 go but 4 anyone doubted that young boi y'all eat all that shut y'all talked Campbell is tough but garcia is the real deal if noo e has been hit like that then they don't know shyt but 2 get back up fight thru an win in that fashion. Hes headed 2 the top..
The fact Campbell knocked down Garcia is absolutely insane and a W in my books. Imagine saying you knocked down Garcia, that gives you respect for life
RIPPED THAT LEFT HOOK AND DROVE IT THROUGH HIS LIVER. ALL SHE WROTE!
great fight , Ryan has heart , needs to keep that face covered tho
lukes ribs look like the 🌊 ocean
The young king weather's the storm. My heart sank when Campbell landed that knockdown. 😳. Uncharted territory for the young king... But he delivered!!!! KING RY KING RY
I Got Haney
I wouldn't advise Garcia to fight Haney next but, Haney will be tougher. It could be one Garcia  could lose. I don't believe he will get up from a hard Davis shot, especially if it's plush. I see how their trying to build up Garcia though. I don't think it will go how it is expected. I'm not sold on Ryan Garcia. Put him in with a banger who make him think, when he sees his own blood. It's different then. Ryan is a pretty boy. He got up from the knockdown though and won. So he showed he can take a hit and get up.
Those body shots really took a toll on him, these two fought their hearts out in the ring...this is  the best fight in 2021... i love this fight
Canelos signature left to the body worked
Fastest highlight video. DAZN a real one for uploading so fast.
Ryan is crazy, ate that hook and got RIGHT back up instantly.
AAAAANNNNNNDDDDD campbell has no power whatsoever
I love García, but he’s not ready for Tank.
Garcia is garbage
Wow this kid is no longer just hype.
First time seeing Ryan fall..... crazyyy!!!
I thought they said Luke Campbell was a decent fighter? Looks like the only punch in his repertoire was a straight right hand.
Davis gonna knock Ryan the F out
I don't like how Ryan is so cocky even after he got chin checked
Stay away from tank
Sure he won but he ain't ready for tank or lopez or even Haney he gotta get more experience in
Took a dive fake
Garcia needs to work a lot. We still need to see more combinations body shots.  If he wanted to fight the big names.
Garcia has no chance against tank
THAT body shot tho
I cant believe i way 55 more pounds then these men, they're not small at all
It looked like it didn’t hurt until it slowmo...
Looks like a baby and hits like a man!
OWWWW
Ryan got hit with a few solid left from campbell that if Tank hit him with he wouldn't wake up for a few minutes.
Can’t wait until he fights a fighter that can fight and they knock him out Ryan is a punk
wow right before that shot Lukes ribs looked fine but atfer that shot and he dropped to his knees maan you can see how quickly his ribs bruised.
He can't beat Tank
Why Ryan Garcia looks like Joao Felix
Man one of the best left hands I’ve seen in a decade. Devin Haney vs Ryan Garcia 2021 please....
A body shot
Muy buena pelea que iso Ryan se descuido y lo tumbaron pero supo regresar y noquear a su oponente felicitaciónes mis respetos
Alright stop wasting everybody's time, Tank vs Garcia make it happen already 🥊
It was nice to see Ryan Garcia flat out on his face. And if you ask my opinion covid-19 big effect on Campbell. He looked winded in the early rounds. But Ryan Garcia jumping at the end like he wasn't flat out on his face is pretty funny 😂
Everyone talks about his comeback but let's be real if he gets touch by tank his going to sleep props for this victory but his not ready yet. Do with him what there doing to canelo and messed his career up and give him more easy fights congrats 👌
Dude has everything a boxing coach wants in a fighter. Talented and got heart. Ring IQ is fixable
I’ll bet Ryan won’t get fooled with that fake right then a left again , other boxer didn’t look to sharp as far as seen it, pretty slow
uke campbe
he got the heart of a lion 🦁
Garcia can't beat tank 💯
Rían García le falta mucho por aprender a cuidarse los golpes para el pupilo del Floyd está muy verde todavia
If Luke was 10 years younger that punch that got Ryan Garcia down would of knocked Ryan Garcia out of his world bc Luke is 33 Ryan is 22 so
Well I guess the he’s a soft pretty boy narrative just went out the window. He took a MAJOR shot, most men aren’t getting up. The way he bounced up after a shot like that he has heart of a champion. And to the constant people saying “Tank would destroy him”. Yes he would both fighters know he isn’t there yet. He’s still growing physically and mentally, he’s still very very young. The tank vs Garcia fight right now would prove nothing for tank and he knows that. That’s why he said ima let him grow and get better then fight him.
Ryan is no match for tank Davis or the top fighters it’s a fact
I'm Proud of Ryan he didn't fold or Get Worried!! Came back like a Champ
RYAN GARCIA IS LORD FOURTH THE YELLOW FLASH  💯💥💥⚡️⚡️⚡️
Great fight great talent here
Follow goodchinboxing on insta
Hahaha he still got knocked down
When they slowed down the punch..i can see why he went down
He ain't ready! That's all I got to say.
Paid
Ryan need's more Work! Work! Work!
the hook ryan got from him was enough for him to be down the whole match he got up quick and was surprised he needed that to be aware and not just throw fast jabs the whole time
7:50 it was better than Benards that Oscar fight looked rigged
He can use this to better his defense skills. Beautiful liver shot tho bet bro going to feel that in morning poopy Lol
Davis & Teo will knock Ryan Out Cold
Ryan should put more muscle mass on his legs he’d have a helluva lot more power.
He not beating Tank! If Campbell dropped him with that shot, imagine what Tank will do with him
oh my
MANNNNN Ryan put everything into that last body hook... that was so crazy. What an amazing fight. Truly.
Beautiful punch by Ryan. Dude just needs to thicken his neck and work on that defense.
This fight humbled ryan Garcia
And He Think He Ready For Tank 🤣‼️ If Tank Hit You With That Over Hand Right Ain’t No Getting Up 🤣🤣🤣
That Aztec blood will always rush and get you back to your feet 🦶🏼
Tank gonna run right over  Kingry 🧐🥱
What a Fight
This man is all hype, but it’ll die slowly.
This clown,can’t beat Davis
Wanted to see Luke teach Garcia a lesson but the way Garcia bounced back after that second round knock down, gotta give Garcia some respect, he earned it. Although he needs another fight or two before he takes on Gervonta or Teo. Garcia needs to improve big time.
B E A UTIFUL!!
Weak fight! Garcia overrated 🙄
Kudos to Ryan but still not enough for gervonta Davis
Great body shot..its over..lol
Campbell was clearly paid off
Now let  them know about the King! 💪👑🇲🇽
This fight was to early, I dint even watched it it was early. Can't even drink right
Linares next, tank davis gonna knock garcia out garcia need more experience
Great fight for both men. Garcia proved he has heart and came out on top like a true champion.
to be honest ryan garcia will knockout tank in the first round.
Everyone talking about how tank gonna ko him. And I'm just here excited for what this division has to offer!!!!
Wanting to fight Gervonta Davis is what you're suppose to say.
he learned that from canelo.
Mad respect for Ryan Garcia
Great fight
Its hard to imagine a win against GTD I'm trying just can't see it
He not ready for tank
I just saw the fight why am I watching this
Would honestly rather see him go up against Haney over Tank. Way more interesting
What a fight for Ryan Garcia. Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?
Garcia!! 🔥🔥
Men this guy it’s a fake ! He never going to do nothing ! When hi face Thank ! He gong to lose !
Ryan got heart but he’s not ready for Tank! Tank his much harder than Campbell!
He ain't getting up if Tank taps that chin.. Ask Leo....
He not ready for tank! Tank hit way harder and is quicker then Campbell.
Ryan looked so stiff. Tank would chew him up.
GET OFF MY BOY KING RYAN!! Vive la RAZAAA..!!
Beautiful body shot I wish he would stop leaving his chin up in the air though.
That body shot was brutal and painful
What a fight the way ryan came bak was great
He ain't ready for Tank.
Gervonta next
One body did it
Now we know next fight with a better boxer Ryan is going to bite the dust
Love and respect for both. I loved it
Ryan needs better defensive head movement
@7:39 Why do I feel like that shot was there all fight long. Anywho Congrats Ryan.
Yea tank will knock Garcia
Here’s the thing....Luke Campbell ain’t no TANK! GTD would’ve broke his jaw and wouldn’t have gave him time to recover even if he did get up
Huge respect to Luke Campbell he dropped Garcia that no one did before  Great fight for both of the fighters
signature canelo body shot!
Glad my boy got the W!
He faced some competition
No Body shots
Mexican power is too much
(2:38) ...you're welcome
Fight of the year 2021 so far, lol
So where the Ryan Garcia haters and doubters at now bet y’all can’t talk smack now 😂 well don’t champ 💯🙏🏼
Y’all can’t say he only fights amateurs nomore
After seeing Ryan aint no way he's ready for tank
Love this kid
Still ain’t ready for DEVIN HANEY 🥊
Fight of the year  Garcia/Campbell >Ruiz/Joshua
This adversity will make him better
He better stay FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR FAR away from tank
Very disappointed in Luke, I feel like he could have won this fight to turn his career around. The way he lost he wont face top shelf competition again.
Thanks DAZN save me some $$$$$$
He not beating tank
Ryan went beast mode after that knock down
I loved that all the online boxing coach's show up to talk 😂
just a little reminder of humbleness
Kid got heat but should learn from this
This was a better win than Tank vs Santa Cruz. Go look up Santa Cruz boxing resume. His resume is a joke lol
great learning experience for ryan garcia this fight showed how much more he has to improve and polish up to reach that next level
In case you were wondering if Americans were tougher than Brits...once again you have your answer.
Fake they bought luke oscar dela hoya he got up bs comon another bloated fighter sad
Ryan proved he could go multiple rounds
Are we all going to ignore how that was a textbook Canelo body shot but revered - instead of laying body shots and then faking and coming to the head, he kept the hooks to the head then came low.  Incredible fight!!
Even though he won I was not impressed by his performance.
Only teofimo anf lomanchenko will be compettion for Ryan.  That's it! If you kno2 you know.
Im glad he won i. Shocked Campbell put him down like that tho 😳 I dont think he gets up if that Teofimo or Tank. Let's make these fights happen in 21' !!
my boy got dropped and came back fighting like a warrior 💪🏾🇲🇽
This boy turning into real life karate kid
Probably he's had was saying get up, but he's lags were frozen that really hurts.
What a body shot great fight
Wow!! Kid got heart!! Congrats!!
Ryan Garcia after he got knocked down  Ryan: what happen?
Did he really call out Tank Davis after this performance....
Ryan would of ko him in round 5 if it weren’t for the bell
kermit in the announcer's booth
If he dont improve his defense, that jaw open like he do, gets that jaw knocked loose!!
So maybe no chin for Ryan if tank hits him like that
Hes gonna get knocked out against elite talent. He has no chin and hes flat footed. An elite fighter would've finished him in that 2nd round
Kid got grit
Thanks for looking out during pandemic times;times r rough right now.
RYAN GARCIA LEARN HOW TO JAB BRO I HOPE U READ THIS
He's way too flat footed and would get starched walking in on tank like this but with that said it would still be a great fight.
Ryan should go against whites chocolate
That boi did canelos finishing move what a mad man
I wonder if theres ever anyone in the underdogs corner that says "they offered us an extra million to drop the fight".
That knock down only made Ryan more dangerous
Luke Campbell gassed out. All he had to do was work behind the jab and he should of threw a straight left down the pipe after that hook and Ryan Garcia would of been done in the 2nd SMH
Garcia does need sum work and improvement but this is what boxing is all about, coming back and showing your skills as a fighter! Props to Garcia and Campbell great fight just the start to two great legacy’s and careers.
I thought Garcia was a better fighter than this I hope y’all don’t put them in the ring with Davis
Gervonta would knock him out
He's 1 of 1 for sure
NO READY FOR TANK
Anyone else feel like Campbell should’ve been more aggressive right after knocking Ryan down ? Nevertheless great fight.
LETS FLIPPIN GO RYAN YOU SHOCKED THE WORLD MAN FIRE BEAT ICE
Tank knocks Ryan all the way out!!
Lettts go
Luke embarrassed this dude😂😂😂
Ryan Garcia will drop Tank Davis in the 7 round remember me guys 🙏🏻
You can’t shake off boy shots like that.  The legs just stop working.  It’s a strange feeling.
It’s crazy that these guys are so light yet they’re normal height.
i just became a Ryan Garcia fan.. i Didn't Think he was going to win this fight
My favorite fighter
Idk man but tonight Ryan did not fight like he usually fights
Hi
respect, showed heart kid
Who watched the fight live
Wow
He not ready for tank sorry 😐 Ryan
I paid money to watch this fight just to end up on YouTube in less than 30 min
i swear these english boxers cant handle body shots from the mexicans
Ryan showed true grit...this fight should have definitely humbled him..If luke knocked him down, imagine what Tank will do to him..nonetheless, hate him or love hime, gotta give Ryan his props..Luke can Hold this L and go back to the 🇬🇧
I'm not surprised, I know he's gonna be a superstar. Canelo Alvarez probably teaches that liver blow
Yea, the kid is making himself out to be a true warrior. I gained respect for Garcia in this fight.
He was thinking about Tik toks
Following cáñelos  foot steps he made a lil mistake there but prove to stay and the fight to finish the punk,,lived king RIAN
I love Ryan, but I still think he needs more time to take on tank. But I know he can definitely had a great chance to do it
Respect for cambull for knocking him down
The way he got dropped should let him know that he need to hold off on trying Tank.
Y’all quit talking about he came back after the guy knocked him down he seem like he was scared to punch him like it was a fix fight
Ryan all hype hands dwn man dwn Ryan will die by one of davis punches..mind you that Luke ain't even a top 20 contender lol
Still dislike Ryan with so much passion lol
No manches freaken Ryan cuando gana, se aguada y parese q sus entrenadores se lo estan cogiendo 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Garcia would make quick work of jake and logan no doubt
Great fight the young Bull showed growth and tenacity.
but can he beat Davis
Weak defense. Tank gonna sleep him
Jake Paul vs Ryan Garcia 🥊🙏🙏👁️👁️
This man garcia has a glass chin💀💀💀😭😭
Ryan thought luke was going for a body shot and he put his right hand down. Luke said sike and sent it to the face. Thats why he got knocked down
Got dropped got up and finished the job Nice work Ryan. You and Tank will be epic but Tank hits much harder
I’m surprised to see DAZN blocked a 30 second clip of this fight on another channel.  It’s like that huh?
Wow Ryan got dropped showed  patience and he fought like a boxer with heart and pulled out the ko win. But he has bad defense and his head is right there for a straight punch when he pulls back. He’s definitely not ready for Tank it’ll be a mistake to fight him next.
Lopez - undisputed, gritty.  Tank - Vicious  Garcia - A throwback Warrior
Garcia keeps his chin too high, he always has. And he head hunts too much with his hands down, needs to keep his hands up, chin down and mix body shots to bring the opponents hands down and soften them up.
Tank knocks ryan out. Especially if he fights on the line like he did against Campbell.
This fight right here. Say that Ryan is better then tank Davis  just my opinion
Ryan improved a lot in this fight which I was hoping for. Time to own this division 🔥🔥🔥
Both of them was terrible, Davis will take him out by the second round with a knockout
Ryan def got what it takes. Great fight.
If tank hit Ryan like that, he would still be sleep right now ..
Ryan might have one but let's be honest did he really
Yessir ☝️
he needs pressure
2 words: Devin Haney
Hater are crawling back to their caves
He’s alive 💀💀 geeez
Awesome fight!
Luke got Ryan with that canelo move lol nice to 👍
Garcia is a throw back old school
Props to Ryan but he needs to learn to tuck his chin too many times does he raise it in a combination
that drop tells how to beat ryan right there
Great comeback win for Ryan Garcia. Looking forward to seeing him against Devin Haney or Tank Davis next 🥊
Psh already watched the fight no need for hightlights
you can’t doubt no fighter going into the ring !!
Ryan took that shot pretty well.
All questions answered!
Nah bro. Definitely needs to stay away from tank. Poor footwork, chin up in the air, relies too much on speed and left hook.......just like Oscar. He will have the height and reach advantage on tank but when tank gets inside, it’s over. Ryan can’t fight on the inside and doesn’t like pressure. Luke Campbell can’t even punch hard. He couldn’t drop Loma or Linares and both of those guys aren’t natural lightweights. Ryan needs 1or 2 fights before tank. Maybe nakatani, Fortuna, or commey.
Devastating body shot! Textbook!!
I told y'all! And he came back from a knock down! What else does he have to prove.
From what I seen, I don’t think he’s ready to fight tank at all but congrats to Ryan
Ryan got up right away after that. He didn’t even take his time got rocked hard and instantly got back up
He definitely learned a lot in this fight! Showed a lot of heart! I can’t wait to see how his defense will improve next fight!!!
After Garcia got knocked down like that. Oscar is gonna be hesitant about letting him fight Tank.
7:33 Yes my boi, that how you keep the British down, go for body shot.
I dont think he beats tank but I definitely am impressed by his heart in this fight. He just needs to work on defense and movement honestly and he'll be great.
Respect to Garcia..Kid got heart
Wowww Garcia a true warrior here tonight
Let’s go
Garcia still got some things to work
Heart heart heart. Question is can he take that left hand shot from tank????
🔥There Has Been 0 Boring Fight That Include Ryan Garcia🔥
Fr, if he gets dropped by someone like that, imagine fighting someone like tank or haney 😂😂he won but got exposed, toughest he’s ever fought and got exposed for having a glass jaw
Ryan the king got dropped and came back and dropped camble with a body shot 😳 👀 💀 😐 😂 😕
A lot of boxing experts in the comment section talking about Ryan’s suspect defense and how he got exposed becuase he got dropped by a world class fighter 😂
Gracia is great fighter. But he’s light work for haney!!
Great fight props to Ryan , but I don't think he would be able to get up from a left like that from Tank .
Definitely a learning curve for Ryan
He needs to learn to be on his toes. He is to flat footed. But great fight. He showed he is a Warrior.
RYAN COULD HAVE PUNCHED HIM AGAIN LOL
That body shot to thee liver man, get hit there and your body shuts down
Ryan is definitely the weakest link amongst the young core. I don’t care what nobody has to say. If Oscar was smart he would not take those fights for another 5-7 years.
Let’s go Ryan
Ride that wave deep into the lions den and test your greatness kid . Great win !
He got the KO with Canelo punch, that’s the punch Canelo told him. Ryan is still green, was getting too eager and not using footwork, but has time to mature.
Garcia will only get more dangerous after getting drop in this fight..he will definitely do better than leo santa Cruz whit tank..
I'm not impressed by your performance-GSP.
Ryan not ready for Tank.
if this underwear model Garcia fights  Tank Davis next it wont be pretty.....  Garcia has no footwork tbh Tank KO's Garcia in 4 maybe 5 rounds at most.
That’s the first time I’ve seen Ryan Garcia fall on the canvas
Who??? Fight devonte Davis stop duckin 🤦🏽‍♂️
If his fighting a southpaw he should always put his hands up not down. He needs head movements and more side to side movements as well..on his offense add more faints that would throws off his opponents timing. He got the speed and power already. He also need to improve his chin...
Shoutout for DAZN getting this out so quick
It’s a lot of boxing legends in these comments
Gervonta would crush him
7:37
Wow
If campbell had that killer instinct like the great fighters he would of won but no killer instinct.
Shocked how Ryan came back after that knock down. Kid has heart and great job from Luke
Canelo was proud! He taught him that 😅
Ryan needs to stay a little more active utilize his jab more or double up with it head then body and if he sits in the pocket  and not engaging he needs to stay on the point with his defense and he waits for the op to throw the first punch! But he pulled off the win that’s all that matters!
Can't wait for the impaulsive episode
Not gona lie felt that body shot.. *ughhhh*
My money is ALWAYS on the Mexican Fighter! 💰💰💰
RYAN NEEDS STRONGER LEGS
I still wanna see Ryan Garcia fight jake Paul tho 😂
Wow, What a comeback.  Showed he can handle adversity. Ryan needs to keep his defense tight tho, he needs to learn from Canelo honestly.
My issue with Tank fanboys is he's not been clipped "Yet".  He too shares the same questions as does anyone else.  Does Ryan beat him?  No.  Can Ryan hurt him?  Definitely.  Tank vs Lopez must happen with a rematch clause.  Ryan fights Haney first, I believe.
Accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and saviour everything happening around the world are bible prophasies accept Jesus he will give you life and set you free Jesus is the only way to heaven accept Jesus believe he died was buried and raised from the dead and you will be saved Jesus is Lord
The hit to the canvas is what woke Garcia up he was out mid air
I knew ryan would go down he stiff n lanky got alot of growin to do in sport but he.s lion hearted an under a bull campaign trainin with canelo
Ahora sí comienza a ser bueno
I was breathing so hard when I saw Ryan go down. The way he got back up, fought like a champion, then took his opponent down...beyond proud. Harder fights await him, but he proved himself on the night.
And you think he gonna tanks punches? Give him 2 years
This is proof that Ryan got a heart of a champion, he took that knockdown well.
Let's soooooooo Ryan
sheesh... what a fight
Ryan used what canelo taught him
Ryan is a very smart fighter no doubt
Con uno d mas pegada García es historia
Ryan García needs to do neck workouts for months non stop he needs to strengthen that chin
Ryan has power but also has a glass chin
knockdown reminded me of Marquez knocking down manny in their last fight i think the second round too
That knockout didn’t stop ryan💪🏽💪🏽STRONG fighter 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽 🐐 TEAM RYAN
Ryan garcia better learn head movement otherwise i see a tank upper cut knockout.
Rematch
Gotta respect his heart and that body shot! Beautiful body shot!
Whenever Luke puts a 1+2, Ryan drops hit right hand a lot. I see him improving hit head movement and footwork cuz we didn’t see much of that.
Ryan garcia better learn head movement otherwise i see a tank upper cut knockout.
Loma is probably thinking real hard about going back to 130 lbs.. The lightweight division just got a whole lot scarier.....
British boi got his bag
Much respect to both fights especially my boi ryan
I love you for not spoiling it w the title OR THE THUMBNAIL!!
Imma Ryan Garcia fan but that looked way too rigged
The next big thing in boxing after Manny Pacquiao!
That body shot is canelos signature passed on to Ryan
Mayweather makes these guys look like amatuers
He not ready for tank
I always go for Ryan but I don’t think he’s ready for Tank.
LETSSS GOOOOOO
He’s not even in his prime yet and he’s proving everyone wrong rn🥶🤙
Gervonta will knock out this guy
Someone was bound to hit him with that hook his face is always open
Mad respect for Ryan 💯
I respect Ryan a lot more the way he got dropped and came back for the win
MAN, WOW: WHAT A FIGHT!😊😎😎
Ryan going to get KO by the top guys.
I think doing all those youtube body shot challenges helped Ryan tonight. haha.
Tank KOz Ryan 7 rounds... Remember  this
I started watching this and said where are the body shots?  Boom! There you go
The unofficial scorecards were bogus! I thought Campbell was winning most of the rounds. Garcia won fair and square but I feel like if he didn’t win with a KO he would’ve gotten the decision no matter what.
My heart stopped when i saw that Ryan got knocked down
His a beast
Garcia has nothing ☠️☠️☠️
Ryan is not ready for Tank yet . He has problems placing his left foot and backing up from attacks. Needs at least 5 more fights .
PURO RYAN! TEOMIFO VS TANK NEXT!
Ryan showed a lot of growth. Faced adversity and came back with that nasty body shot
7:39 that slowmo replay looks nothing like the live hit lol crazy
Is that Canelo’s deceptive left hook.
Campbell vs Davis lets see if he has the balls to fight a bigger and taller fighter at 135lbs . I doubt Mayweather will let that fight happen
He's still a youtuber/tik-toker but respect
Thanks DAZN!!!
Where all the ryan haters go???
DAZN needs to give the editor a raise always fast and on point with these highlights
Canelo taught him well with that left hook to the body.  The guy is for realz.  He clearly beats devin. As for tank and teofimo its 50/50.
That body shot was ruthless
This fight right here just changed my mind about this kid He's got heart
Evan tho he won the fight the knock down will haunt him but fair play to the both
He got knocked down and came back and won ..but haters will hate
Got Ya Kid u lucky 5:12
My son ryan is a true warrior tribe of issachar
And y'all think he can take a tank punch ? Campbell isn't evn a power puncher . tank will give Ryan the leo treatment out cold
Tank hit wit one of those and Ryan corner gone need to get the ambulance on its way. He don't want smoke wit tank or Devin
Your Mind is Telling you to get Up BUT your LEGS won't Let you 🤷
Definitely not ready for tank
Lo último que debes hacer es estar de espaldas vs el rival que costal le pusieron a ryan jajaja
7:13 right there....
Was hoping Campbell would win Ryan needs to get humbled. He’ll lose his next fight to rank or teofemo Lopez.
He learned that body shot from Canelo lol.
No matter what circumstance ryan is in, he will always get hated on
Who is down to box me
Badass fight
King Ryan Garcia shocking the word
Ryan needs to work the body like he did more, he wants to go straight for the ko.
Ryan got my respect, showed he has heart.
I think he is not ready yet for Teófimo or Tank   they can finished him easy that guy not pressuring him after the knockout. For sure now Floyd wanna make the fight possible the kid not protect his face and the leg movement steady  is devastating, but the kid have power no doubt
I see him beating HANEY , BUT HAVIMG PROblems with DAVIS..
Classic shot! The kid was too slow for Garcia.
I am a young mexican. I only hope I can follow Ryan's dicipline and hard work, but sadly he is easy work for Tank right now. I think even Devin Haney outboxes him.
Gervonta davis lookin like 😈
That knock down makes look at garcia as the next amir khan. Is his chin not that strong
Man garcia just stands, wheres his footwork
Tank would KO this dude
That was nasty
California kid came back like a Champ 🙌🏽
so he ready for tank? 🥴
Still a hype job that hasn’t fought anyone?
ryan needs to work on head movement but other than that he is a goat
Big time comeback. He's was nailed in the 2nd round. True sign of a champion.
looked like a canelo body shot
Wow. I thought it was over when Ryan got layed out. Im glad he won, ive been rooting(or a fan) for him since he made it in the professional matches.
Vencio con un golpe que canelo le enseño, tiene que seguir aprendiendo rayan mucho mas de canelo si quiere llegar a ser comobel canelo
Ryan took a punch but listen if he fights tank that’s the biggest challenge he’ll get if Luke’s hit knocked him now imagine tank Davis !!!
Garcia is soft
PROVING PEOPLE WRONG AGAIN UAAAA LETS GOOO WARRIOR 💯🥊🥊
Garcia has great power but he lacks the boxing skills. Almost like Wilder. And he needs to keep his hands up. But congrats, he came out and did what he needed to do.
Stay away from tank young man
5:30 bru look at that poor face of campbell 😢😢😢
Was a great fight by the Young Ryan Garcia But if Tank touches him like that he might be done for the night.
Haney gonna get knocked out
Keep Ryan far from Tank Davis....he’s not ready yet....Tank will put this boy to sleep 😴
Kid has a chin. That was a picture perfect shot and he got up immediately, no shaky legs whatsoever.
Quartey knocking down the golden boy Oscar came back gain his respect by getting up showing balls but keeping his intelligence, Ryan is what Oscar would deep down want his son to be.
Well I guess this gone be Ryan’s last fight, if he goes against tank he’s dead 🤷🏻‍♂️
It was a fight once Ryan got knocked down after that everything changed
Great Fight and thanks for the Fast Upload. Ryan needs Ronda Rousey’s coach to teach him “Head Movement” lol That Body Shot was Beautiful tho 💯👌🏽🥊🥊🤣🤣
Now fight Tank
Can't lie that body shot was very nasty 🥴
why didn't campbell get up?
HE SHOULD STAY AWAY FROM TANK!!
Luke Campbell when Ryan Garcia got up from that knockout :  👁👄👁
The fact that Ryan got knocked like that and came back to win the fight shows how much heart this kid has
Tank davis would deff be a great fight for Ryan
I am in disbelief like Foreal I would never though pretty boy Instagram famous YouTube famous Ryan García will comeback from this i still can’t believe it he is a champion came back n won the fight !!
Luke Campbell looked better than all of tanks opponents combined 😂
Came back on a body shot?! Ryan is the man. He looked like he had power. There it is.
An argument could be made that he was knocked out but gg Ryan, nice finish
That’s has to hurt like a bit## 🥊
Hey dazn, could we get a highlight of top knockouts from last year?
it looks a lot like canelos body shots on rocky fielding
Boxing is back!
Seen a lot of trash in boxing. I don't buy this, a fighter will try to get up even if his ribs were broken. I don't know what to believe.
Canelo is jealous because he fights bums while Garcia is asking for the BEST FIGHTERS.
Everybody in here saying he has heart... yea he does but 2 things his flaws show more in this fight as well as Luke aint a killa after getting up he shouldve jumped on the opportunity to finish
So is luke campbell a true power puncher or no?
This was Oscar de la Hoya vs Giorgio Campanella all over again
Canelo shot
He needs to works on his defense
Great body shot.
That body shot was nasty the Canelo special he hit him with
That body shot was nasty
I don't like rayan but he was come and comprs but for his future fighters he showed weakness
IDGAF if Ryan won, Luke showed alot to flaws about Ryan and being exposed even while winning is bad for next time he fights.
Luke = gate keeper
DAZN Editor had this vid ready before the fight was even announced 🤣
When Ryan got knocked down by Luke Campbell in the 2nd round. I thought he was completely out cold and that nearly got me worried for a second because I thought he was gonna suffer his first KO loss.
Excelente trabajo de la esquina
I’m so happy Ryan won both of these men are talented fighters props to both this was a great fight
I See A Oscar Dela Hoya In Ryan But He Not Ready For Gervonta Davis
I dont think he ready for tank
Tell me that I ain’t the only who realized that the reff counted way too fast
That looked vicious, probably broke his rib.
Luke Campbell biggest mistake is that he didn't apply the pressure when he had Ryan Garcia hurt, but instead he was looking to set him up for that big punch again  and allow Ryan Garcia to get back into the fight.
boxing looks boring without the Fans
Awesome fight, totally worth it. Ryan showed two key things: 1. Overall, he's a better boxer than Campbell. 2. the criticism he´s received so far (Instagram boxer, does not know how to defend himself) while not entirely baseless, was exaggerated, probably due to jealousy.
The best thing Garcia will cherish is getting dropped because he knows now to leave his hands up and tucked his chin. Oscar got dropped early in his career and only made him better. Lucky it wasn’t TANK or else.. kid still needs work so this fight will steer him in the right direction with it.
Luke should of never let him recover.
Ain't ready for tank! He will get leo santa cruzed! Mark my words ..tank will catch on to him dropping his hand and time it perfect
Quick count ? Carnelo get those to. Looks like you have ko him to win
Ryan better STAY TF AWAY FROM TANK DAVIS 😂😂😂
And 4 Campbell...he can go back to uk!
He used the Canelo punch!
I got Ryan beating the tank by the end of the year if they fight.
*SECOND ROUND KO, 🤣 TODAVÍA NO ESTÁS PREPARADO PA GRANDES BATALLAS RYAN 😪*
Pov ur here cause kids on ur snap postin it lol
Devin Haney will handle Ryan Garcia
Damm I’ve never seen him knocked out
Biggest shock was how horrendous the commentary was.  Please hire Andre Ward, RJJ, Paulie...
Why didn't Campbell finish Garcia off??
Ryan stepped on his foot the first round😂
Ryan NEEDS!! to fight HANEY next because IF he wins he'll FINALLY have a Title. TANK is at Superfeatheweight Right Now and has only fought at lightweight once. Honestly tho Haney stops or beats RYAN by decision in my opinion. Ryan is tough but a little but a little simple in style for a smooth defensive boxer like Haney
No head movement from garcia he won't be undefeated for long. His defense looked awful. He has fast hands but he's flat footed and has trouble avoiding shots. He eats way too many shots just to get his offense going.
That was a Canelo shot niceee ! Canelo looked so proud 🥲
If tank catches him like that there is no way he'll get back up.
Garcia is a beast. Great video
Team Ryan Garcia respect to Luke Campbell guy has lots of talent and respect to him and his team team Ryan Garcia 💯🇲🇽🇺🇸
Weak Chin couldn't handle Teo or Tank but maybe Haney someone not as powerful
Thanks this was a great video
Man ryan hit him with a perfectly timed body shot, he just needs the canelo head movement and he”ll be ready
He Catch 1 Of Those By Tank He Ain't Getting Up!💯✔
Wasn't tank fighting bums at 22? Ryan the real deal.
That was a flash knock down on Ryan didn’t affect him just so early in the fight all that happened
Ryan looked ok but he is not a Title holder yet..So unpolished! Comes in with his chin on a golf tee just screaming hit me..Needs better defense. Needs to protect that chin or hes gonna get tagged but the elite guys over and over. Not impressed at all. I thought he would have better head movement for all the hype on this guy..Foot work was not impressive! Yes his left hook is wicked. Still not impressed with his overall skills..Not a hater.
Once he improves his defense, Ryan will be on the top. Great fight and thanks for the speedy highlight upload per usual DAZN <3.
Man that was the first time that Ryan Garcia got knocked out in the third round but thankfully he didn’t give up. And I’m so happy he wins once again. GO RYAN, GO RYAN, GO CHAMP, GO CHAMP 🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
who has faster hands, Ryan Garcia or the editor who made this vid
When hyped fighters get put in check. Lucky for him he managed to get thru it. Class C fightee at best in the teofimo level or tank for that matter
Esa pelea no sirvió fue un costal el que le pusieron
Yeah Ryan isn’t ready for Tank
funny they think that dude ever had a chance lol
Nice to see Garcia get knocked out
Round 2 = 2020 , round 7 = 2021
I told y'all what was gone happen 🙈 let's go ryannnnnnnnnnn💪🥊 were tank at 🤣
He ain't getting up from a Gervonta KO ... He gotta watch who he calls out
Garcia would get killed by tank Davis
Tank is sweating rn
All these YouTube “experts” obviously he’s young in the game, what a comeback
Ryan knocks out Tank aka Oompa Loompa inside of 7
luke, should of finish ryan when he had ryan hurt
He will never beat Tank or deven this is a fact. Like it or not
The way ryan just shakes off that knockdown gives me chills
No way Ryan Garcia walking through tank Davis, Ryan Garcia has quick hands but slow feet, he keeps his chin too high up for a powerful compact fighter like tank Davis.
Wooow best Ryan gracias fight ! Came back that’s champion mentality
That’s that Canelo body shot. 👍
I dont care what you about the say Ryan got heart
If that was gervonta davis that hit ryan like that, the fight wouldve been over, he wouldve never gotten up.
Great Fight 👌
Wish I could’ve placed a bet
Tank Davis will dislocate Garcia's chin. No Doubt.
Expected a risky counter left hook from Campbell but the king too quick.
Let's go!!!!!
I like the fire of Ryan and the fact he got back up to fight after the knock down . But Campbell set that knock out up and after the knock out took it easy on Ryan . Gevante won't do that . He will set that knock out up and if * you get up hes coming in no mercy .
Congratulations! Nice rally back!!
Garcia has a long way to go to be a great fighter. But he is young maybe he'll get there.
What's  after  Jake paul but nah it wont happen
ryan is gonna keep shocking the world💪🏽
Ryan is a young man, still much to learn. He will be a great champion
Amazing!
Bro give the editor a raise
Entertainment at its finnest but the commentary in this fight was the most biased I've ever seen
BIG WIN!! FOR RYAN!!
Tank,haney,lopez,or even Stevenson gives him a problem if he doesn't tune up a little.
Here before Key Epic says something cringe for likes
Tank will eat him for breakfast lunch and dinner
Yea he needs to stop calling Tank Davis out! He not ready for him yet
Garcia has not chance against the tank and teofilo
Joshua Vs Fury Spence Vs Crawford Tank Vs Teofimo Garcia Vs Haney  I’d pay $100 to watch this card lol
When Ryan Garcia fight any of the hard hitting punches from 135 división that will be it for this show off kid!
Amazing comeback from Ryan Garcia!!! It’s what KINGS DO!!!👊🤫
Cant teach toughness🇲🇽🔥
Devin and Tank ko Ryan, but the kid got heart, looking forward to his upcoming fights. Well done tonight Ryan.
Tank stops lil buddy tho
He got that canelo mentality,  walk forward and body knock outs .. he earned all his respect tonight 👏
Ryan handled this well. No shame in that knockdown, but just made me think what if tank lands flush like that. They’ll hold off on that fight for a little longer now. Great win tonight!
Campbell is an idiot, let him off after than knock down
After seeing him get up from that and finishing his opponent. You have to respect that
Esto le sirve de experiencia para que se prepare más. Vamos Ryan chap.
*Really great stuff from Ryan, had Campbell hurt repeatedly, then put him away.*
Met Ryan Garcia at my home town movie theater.. nice guy, humble we talked about his next fight and always kept it respectable. Congrats to this young man. This was March of last year before all this COVID jazz.
Ryan is too flat footed to beat devin Haney. He has to work on his angles and head movement
Wow!
Esa caida del segundo round es una llamada de atencion,dejate de mamadas...esas payasadas de entrar al ring de esa forma es una ridiculez y una falta de respeto a tu publico y a quien te enfrentas...muy buen triunfo pero te hace falta un chingo de humildad.
Luke looks like he’s a teenager and he’s 33 lol
Glass jaw Ryan)
Luke Campbell needs to order some Chinese food because he ain't got no combination
ryan showed he has heart and can battle through adversity but imo he gets crucified by tank...ryan can beat haney but not tank...
some people get rocked like that and lose there composure, i like that he kept his cool and stayed level-headed shows he's a true professional.
Imagine this guy wants to fight Gervonta..He not ready yet but congrats on the win....Campbell needs to get a new trainer
If Tank caught him with the same punch Garcia would got put in a body bag ☠️ 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 Just Saying
Great win for that young boy,but I feel they have to go back to the drawing board.
Tank would have finish him once he got up from the campus cause he was hurt you cant let tank smell blood at all
For him to come back from a shot like that, this kid really is for real
What a show
Luke was down on Bended Knees like he's Proposing 😂
EX ...POOOOOOOSED!!!!😂
Yeah he needs a couple more fights be for tank
He gonna take this as a learning lesson watch.
Weak chin like Amir khan
I was nervous for Garcia until he got dropped.  Once he got dropped and got back up, my nerves left me and I knew he had from there
Damm campbell is tha 1st boxer to knockdown ryan garcia but he got bak up and gave him that cold body shot made Campbell stay down for tha count just imagine that was Tank ryan garcia wouldn't get up on that vicious punch 👊
for some reason I thought it started at 10-11pm like most fights
Nicely done
Yes! I was rooting for Ryan the whole time! I got scared when he got knocked over, but he came back!! Woohoo!
7:40 at x .25 speed. BRUTAL!! 😬
Lesson learned...Don't underestimate the opponent.
Here come the unemployed YouTube boxing coaches.
If Ryan wants to fight Devin Maney or gervonta Davis he’s gonna have to train harder
Ryan can learn a lot from this fight . 1 stop pulling back with his hands down , 2 use more head movement, 3 stop leaning his head to the right side especially against a left handed fighter and to stop lunging with his hooks ..  . But all in all he has the tools to be great. Tonight he showed he has heart after that knock down . Also great body shot
Why tf Campbell’s socks so high
The difference between Luke Campbell dropping you and Tank dropping you is you don’t get back up... let’s make the fight happen
Great heart from Ryan but he lacks real boxing ability right now. Can’t move laterally and lacks head movement. He needs to learn to fight going backwards since he does have fast hands, his legs are really stiff. I want see him and tank or Devin Haney next
respect fr
He tight but he don't want Tank yet .his chin not ready..
My goodness Ryan fights exactly like oscar. Oscar of course much sharper, but the temperament!
imagine having Canelo in your corner
stop sleeping on Ryan that boy a problem
I wonder how Ryan’s chin will hold up in the future after eating that overhand
ryan the goat
Honestly was hoping for garcia to get knocked out
We need a corner talk video with eddy reynoso and Ryan!!!!
Just watched the whole fight for free
Ryan needs a tune up fight  before tank, he need to work on his defense,  footwork, and listen to his coach,  he was pretty flat on his feet.
Saw*
lets go ryan !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Live crowd and u still have covy around spreading
ryan put sum anger in the last punch because right before the body shot luke hit him with one and it looked like ryan didnt like it all
Mexican blood man. same as andy ruiz
Excellent!body shoot. So easy..where is my money?🥊🥊🥊🥊
First thing Ryan thought about when he got knocked down "Social Media "😂
that liver shot is very reminiscent of canelo's. Its great to see that the training is really working.
2:38
Now we know Ryan can take a knockout punch, go the distance, and take out an elite competitor with a body shot. Mad respect to the instagram kid.
Ryan got to comfortable.. too soon.. he put the pressure on Luke and broke him
Campbell fainted like it was gonna be a body shot but went to the chin instead. From what i say. That's if that's what Garcia was thinking. If he even saw it at all
Finally lol
Ryan Garcia fell down like Andy Ruiz
Im giving canelo credit for that body shot
Guys a knock out is when you don't make the 10 count. A tko is when the doctor or referee stop the fight And a knockdown is getting up before the count
Ryan passed the Test 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Garcia the best young fighter out there , he's a superstar already and whoever he faces will get knocked out
Guys I Uploaded The Full Fight On My Channel
He showed a heart of a champion
2:32 woow
Y’all hate on Ryan for no reason but he’s a champ 👊
he said that got campbells attention and ryan didn’t even connect 😭
Me: *looks for highlights* DAZN: *Blocks them* Me:F**K DAZN  DAZN: Here are some highlights
If Tank catches him like that he i dont think he will get back up !!! But congratulations on the comeback!
That's what I was waiting for, how Garcia will respond from a K.O, and he surprised me by coming back with a T.K.O!!!!
Ryan a great boxer but there's definitely some other boxers that can and will expose him gd win tho
Wow 👏
After seeing this  Tank davis will win against king ry by knockout😔
Ryan was losing pretty bad until that body shot.
He better stay away from Haney. Hes not ready
idc what anyone says this fight proves he's legitimate
It's nice to see a tougher opponent face him, but he needs to fight the higher tiers in the division.
Ryan is a dog!!!
Garcia's footwork is absolutely terrible.
He should fight Gamboa or Santa Cruz next. Just to compare a little.
Remember Ryan is a counter puncher, and he’s best as a counter puncher. this fight he came forward with full offense and dominated. he practically knocked Luke down twice if you wanna count where he hanged on the ropes turned around and got saved by the bells (jesus)
That Trevejo Malu puh is what gave him the power to get back up after after knock down! Lol
everybody is talking about how Ryan got back up but no one is mentioning how Chepo Reynoso managed/coached that corner.
🇲🇽 WYA
Tank bout to rip this fool
I hope he is not another Amir khan!
I'm tired of these body shot ko's..
Well hes definitely a real mexican lol
Man Ryan ain’t ready for tank yet but I wanna see that lomachanko fight
This kids special yo!
what a body shot ouch! he's hurt bad... hurt a kidney or rib for sure
He has a lot of natural talent and really fast hands, but doesn't look well rounded. Seems overhyped now, but if he can improve it will be exciting.
BRO I DONT THINK RYAN HAS EVER FALLIN ON THE CANVAS BUT AT LEAST HE GOT BACK UP
Give him a few years! Esto va comenzando. 🏋🏻‍♂️🇲🇽🇺🇸🇲🇽🇺🇸💪🏼
5:49
Cool and all but if tank catches Ryan like Luke did, Ryan will be waking up 3 days later.
Is there ever going to be a fighter who fights like Triple G
WOW Ryan actually beat Canelo at something tasting the floor.
Whatever.. Garcia ain’t ready for Tank, Stevenson, Loma, or Haney.
Ryan needs to work on he’s defense and head movement I saw the lack of experience he’s not ready for the top fighters but being with canelo he will improve he’s got speed and power al he need  sis defense and experience
Is this tonight's fight or what
I don't understand the hype with this guy..he regular lol
beautiful liver shot, position of the left hook made Campbell think its a left hook to the head then goes in low for the clean liver hit
Tank finishes this HYPE JOB in 5 rounds... At the most...
Tank stops 🛑 him
I stand corrected. The man has heart. respect.
VIVA MEXICO CABRONES
Ryan got Canelo taking him under his wing, Devin will be easy W but tank is another league.
Yeah he forsurely not ready for tank
This reminded me of that first Joshua vs Ruiz fight lol gg Ryan 🔥
Beautiful body shot
וואו זה היה מדהים⚪🟡⚪🟡⚪🟡⚪
Ryan chin sus tho
Like if Jake Paul kills kis n the ring
that ko in the second was nothing 🤣
Bro,when ryan was down and got back up even after a really deadly punch,he firmly got up,he said he was dizzy in the interview, but in the ring he was stanging like nothing happened, i admire him
Some people saying Ryan has a glass chin Not really Campbell punch was perfect timing and right on the Chin plus Campbell is a heavy hitter
He cant let Tank or Teo hit him like that or he aint gettin up
I think this knocked down on ryan is going to make him more humble that he can be touched and make him work harder because tank and haney are no joke
Thanks for the free money Ryan!
Garcia still a much more entertaining fighter than Haney
Ryan needs to improve his defense
Tank will eat him alive 💀
definitely not ready for tank
The flash ⚡️
👎👎
When Ryan start fight those black Campion he will take a loss... tooo flat
2:38 Best Part lol 💀😭🤣
Garcia really impressed, he took that shot very well. Honestly thought he wasnt going to recover. He came back mexican style and ended it with a body shot.
Ryan can't fight on the backfoot at all, He better stay away from Tank and Teo!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Goat in the making
He got humble
I knew he was going to get KO!!
Wow. I'm surprised
Ryan is in great shape coming back from the knockdown he took it pretty well. Dnt think he's ready for tank. Would like to see him and Haney fight next.
Luke Campbell was a legit threat and Garcia passed even though he needs to work on defense.
Se le estaba complicando pero con buen entrenador y disiplina táctica llevo buena la pelea...bien ryan García
Here's all the KNEW IT ALL people in comment section haha!!!!
body shot lookin like canelo’s
Dont think hes ready for tank
Ryan is a true fighter. He may not have enough to prove that he is the best but he needs to be respected as a true fighter. This fight was his glory moments he felt this one ☝🏽
This kid is too cocky he will get k.od by Tank with one punch.   No defense , he ain't ready for the big boys yet. A couple more fights and needs to refine his skill
First of all, this fighter Campbell was weak, I made this comments when canelo fought smith, I said majority of European boxers doesn’t train like the fighters in America or Mexico. When Garcia was dropped, Campbell didn’t capitalize, but if that was Tank, Haney, Lopez, loma, Santa Cruz, Stevenson or Mikey, do you actually think his going to get up. Don’t think so. Now it shows the Ryan Garcia has a questionable chin. But give him a lot of credit , by getting up and continued the fight, The fight was not entertaining as I thought it would be. Campbell just gave up period. That’s a signed of weakness and loser. My opinion.
He has not beat no one
He hit him with a hard liver shot. Ouch
He ain’t hanging with two and Davis at all ... his chin is suspect af
Nothing wrong with going down no shame 👍🏻
💪🏼🇲🇽🇺🇸🏋🏻‍♂️
💪🏼🇲🇽🇺🇸🏋🏻‍♂️
once ryan took his best punch, he just walked him down because he new he won
Luke hit ryan with a body shot too and ryan said "alright my turn" 8:03
even tho he won im happy but im sad he got knocked down
Dazn and commentary Mora and that Chris are pathetic !! They must of been on there knees pads whole time while giving their bias 2 cents humpfest like Garcia did to his Trainer after that Ko
🥊Is it me or do English boxer's (NOT ALL) seem to lack the killer instinct☠️ 🥊They are well schooled in STRONG fundamentals, however "maybe" too Gentlemanly 🎩
Man he needs more fights like this he's still young
Resist medical tyranny
Garcia did it but he has a lot to learn before he can beat Davis. I hope he does but may the best man win.
Oscar de la hoya was sweating ballz after Garcia got knock down in second round. Garcia is his blink blink!!!!
Where’s all the García haters at ??
Ryan dont want no parts of Gervonta Davis smh
put some respect on the man 🇲🇽💯 great fight from both fighters 🙏🏻
Finally, the kid was getting too cocky but, proved himself. Also, tank is a different story.
If he gets knocked down against Luke Campbell, imagine what tank would do to him
DAZN is the real deal with these uploads
Congratulations champ!!
He will not get up when he gets in there with tank
KING RYFAN 💪🏼
García only proved he has flaws.... major ones. He’s gonna get hurt with the big boys(Davis, Lopez) Stay on tick tok....
Kingry is unstoppable, now that he knows how it feels to get knocked down he will truly be untouchable!
7:35 well that didn’t go as planned lol. Congrats on the win.
.placed looked Dead
Thats that Mexican blood pumping in his heart that made him get up from that knock down ,very impressive 👏 👌
After this performance theirs no way he could compete against gervonte Davis🤷🏽‍♂️
Garcia is nuts
Finally those videos of the body shot challenge paid off
7:29 you can feel the euphoria
It got so quiet that you can hear their steps, I knew Ryan was going to win, when he fell down I still knew he was going to win, when he fell, he was shocked but he didn't let his emotions get in the way, he got up and finished the fight like a champ. I never saw Ryan as an Instagram boxer because I saw how hard he worked.  CONGRATS "Instagram" boxer, Now everyone knows he is a real boxer and everyone sees it now.
This just proves he's not ready for gervonta Davis.
he goes to sleep against tank lol make the fight please. haney works ryan over
Let's put big mouth haney vs luke 🤔🤔 probably a 12 round boring fight.
Haters and critics where you at?? Stand up!!
Ryan vs loma ?
Not impressed. Tank would end him
🤝🧑‍🦼💨
All them body shot challenges paid off ha
with those size gloves tank would have killed him literally
That's that tough Mexican blood in him that made him get back up & finish strong... much respect! Shut alot of critics up this fight.. The competition is only gonna get tougher from here on out!! Great entertaining fight overall...
He fights bums
This is why I don’t buy dazn fights, they upload them as soon as they’re done. $50 saved and I’m eating pizza.
2:37 Oscar got scared for a sec😂
Campbell got a fat paycheck to lose! He wasn't expecting to knock Ryan out with that left , Campbell was holding out the whole fight
Imagine Tank landing the punch that Luke knocked Ryan down with. Night Night
Ryan ain't nothing special..he's ok🤷‍♂️
Ryans biceps been looking crazy lately
Gervonta would knock this kid out right now... teofimo would beat both!!
That body shot was super quick and subtle
Ryan has heart but his not ready for Tank Davis! 👊🏼
Who else notice Luke turned red when he got hit by left hook
Raro que después que lo tumbó ya no siguió golpeando a Brian García, como si le hubieran dicho ya deja de pegarle
Ryan Is legit boys
Lopez (ko), Loma (tko), Tank (ko) and Devin (UD) take Kingry.
Ryan is the best lightweight hands down and he’s going to end up improving foot and head movement
The haters about to switch up more than politicians lol
Haney will duck him
The kid Ryan has heart and even tho Luke lost he earned my respect and he has a new fan in me  Looks like Ryan is the real deal....NEXT!
If u think he can take TANK then your crazy💯
Some people are actually saying things like "he got exposed, or Glass Chin"  but to me he showed me he showed the opposite. He showed he can get seriously dropped, get back up, outbox, and Knock out a guy who never been knocked out with a body shot.Tank,  Haney, or Teofimo never been dropped like that so we dont know how they would respond some fighters cant respond after because their legs go but i think if Teo or Tank landed that shot Cleanly on Ryan im not so sure he would of got up like that and if he did Tank and Teo will Finish you.  Ryan definitely a warrior though
Tank will destroy him. He had better not take that fight.
A true champ knows what it feels to fail
Here before on trending
Ryan García si cae ya se vio!  No tiene buena quijada "ojo"
Ryan’s cockiness almost lost him the fight. He needs to focus 100% of the time while he’s in the ring.
garcia isn't ready for guys like tank, teo, or Devin he needs to work on defense.
everybody saying dogvartis davis would sleep him if they were to fight today For sure but not after today ryans gonna work on defence and will be to fast for davis
Glad to see Ry with that fight in him to bounce back, but let's be honest he needs a couple more years before we talk Tank or Teofimo
Let’s the forget Teofimo the takeover Lopez face of the 135 division 😈
Campbell después que lo tumbó volteo y pensó ya la cague en la cláusula era no golpear tan duro Jajajajaja otro circo 🤡
What a liver shot... s/o Oscar and Canelo for taking Ryan under their wings this is definitely the new golden boy
Garcia vs Lopez? Tefomio Lopez will nock Garcia on the first round
Here to read all the "yeah sure, but..." comments ⬇️⬆️
even the highlight is boring. Headbutts should be legal in boxing, so boxers wouldn't just load up and fall in. That is how you break your hand in a bare knuckle fight.
Garcia has got no defense. Chin is questionable. Got dropped hard by a guy not known for punching power. He needs to stay away from Tank
Well done young man, well done
Do y’all think Ryan looked rusty fighting ?
cant wait to see him destroy the opposition in these next upcoming fights, hes going to have tank punching air and will soon be world champ for sure
He hit him with that canelo bodyshot
Proud of you Ryan and check out his coaches haven’t seen that reaction in a long time! Eddie Reynoso 👑
That last body shot was perfect
Fake!
He needs two more decent fights and better work on foot movement/head movement.  That ain't it against Tank, Lopez, or Haney.  He's got crazy potential, but his a 2nd tier fighter when compared to them at least now.
Congrats to the newly crowned interim champ, Garcia.
that knock down set a spark in ryan garcia and went in on luke
Tank will destroy this boy
yessssss
1. Playback speed 0.25 2. Play it at 7:39 3. Enjoy
Kid got power but that defense tho, needs work.
if luke campbell did this. Imagine Tank ?
I knew Ryan was going win
Now boxing fans know not to sleep on Garcia🥊🔥
Ryan got up and shocked the world 🌎
DAZN quick with these highlights.
Tank or Teo will KO Garcia
*😦* ... When Ryan Went Down! But Also Me *😬 When He Won.
He took a nice punch. Got tested.
King R is special
FAT TANK DAVIS NEXT!
Ryan don’t got no pillow hands forsure
Fighting a southpaw is no joke.
“TaNk DaViS iS aN EliTe FigHTer He kNoCKs oUt GaRcIa” says casualfan42069
Luke took that shot in the 5th and didn't look the same after, no way he was going to go 12 rounds
Great win but corona might have hurt his lungs but great win. He still dropped luke for the first time in his career and over came adversity. The best in that division might come down to who has the best chin. But I’m cheering for Ryan
LETSSSS GO HAD FAITH IN YOU RYAN
Fair play to both of them but that round 5 bell saved Luke’s life honestly
I new you got .... Ryan
Who wants tank davis vs. Ryan Garcia on May 5th?
Kids needs more patience. I see alot of agression with no setup. He is much better at countering.
7:37 OOF
ryan still raw haney will destroy him
Year
he still got a jumpy style when he gets aggressive. I know he will be better soon. Just the kid in him
Just like his new daddy Canelo. Nicely done, Tank next.
I'm calling "fix fight" only another fighter would understand.
Ryan's chin has always been suspect.
If Ryan works on defense he wouldn’t be knocked down but he’s still young and has a lot to learn
The editor for DAZN has the fastest hands in boxing :)
Tank will beat em down
Daasssa canelo body shot
Perfect punch
Respect to Ryan and Campbell I felt bad when Ryan and Campbell got knocked💯Both earn respect ✊
Liver shot all day!
Anyone else wanna watch him get knocked out by lopez?
That’s the canelo type stuff
even after the first knock down i knew he was going to stop luke. he is young and lacks experience but he has heart hope you boxing "experts" give him his props.
Dazn coming in with the highlights not even an hour after the fight is over. MVP
first one to knockout campbell... luke's experience did make a difference,but ryan came thru after he calmed down and listened to eddie..congrats
Besides his hand speed it’s impressive about Garcia.. he need more training less Instagram
Ryan them eyes be closing tto much
ryan beats everyone except teofimo
Ryan getting floored will only make him better
He is not taking a Davis punch!!!
What a fight!
Caneloish! Viva mi Raza Cosmica (all colors in)!
Needs to work his defense or a top guy is gonna knock him out
Let’s gooo
Now if Ryan go against tank Ryan has no chance
Those are the one the hurt the most the least suspected that looks crazy in slow mo
By far the most important win of Ryan Garcia's career. This fight gave him the experience he needed to go to the next level. You don't learn much about yourself if you keep winning by KO in Rd 1.
I called it ryan wins round 7 let's go
Difference is when Tank connect and knock him down... Ryan ain't getting up in time.
Ryan vs Davis or Ryan vs Haney ??
Ryan. Need to get that head moving. Or he needs to completely avoid Tank Davis..
This fight reminded me of the movie creed in a way.. Ryan’s heart really showed!
All this showed me he’s not ready for Tank lol if Tank hits him with that same shot Campbell hit him with it’s lights out 💯
Gervonta davis le va a poner una putisa a García
Hopefull this fight humbled him a little, if that was tank he would’ve died, Ryan relies on that left hook way to much. He tries to use that hook as his defense by better them to the put and somebody better is gonna see that a bait him.
Great job by young Garcia.
Ryan is still levels beneath tank Haney and Lopez   A fish swimming with sharks
Let's see what the pros on youtube have to say about kingry now.
ryan is soft
Teofimo would school him.
LETTSSSSSS GOO
I was at the fight he signed my boxing gloves
Let that have been tank.. he wouldn’t have got up
Well, at least we all know that Garcia has heart now. I really thought it was gonna be a clean KO based off how his legs looked when he fell. Slow mo shows that he was completely out for about a second.
This kid can beat tank I believe it
Ryan Garcia vs Gervonta Davis will be the fight to watch!!
He may not be the best but he is entertaining to watch
What a body shot..
Garcia... lol dude cant fight sorry. GL GOLDEN BPY BUT THIS AINT THE BOY HERE
I’m glad that shot humbled Ryan, he was getting a little too cocky in the beginning but overall showed true heart. Still got tank over him..
I want to see ryan garcia vs teofimo lopez fight
People will always find a way to hate on Garcia. They said this is his first test against actual competition and he TKO'd him. Give this man his respect
Here before 1m views
I knew Ryan would win! LETS GOOOOO
Shakur Stevenson stops ryan
And people really think Ryan can beat Davis 😂
Campbell looks just like Canelo but does not box like him
Ryan Garcia definitely beats devin Haney as for tank he beats him by decision cuz he too tall and strong for gervonta.
7:40 the referee even knew it was over😂
Ryan can’t just rely on his hands. He needs them feet and head to move too. Great win tho. Lot of heart.
That body shot was brutal. Impressed at coming back from the Jaw knock down. Go Garcia!!
Imagine if that was Devin, Teo or Tank that Knocked down Ryan do y’all think Ryan is getting back up? Let’s go ask Leo? Hey Leo how was it like to be KO’d by Tank? Leo: “ZZZZZZZZZ.”
Wicked body shot
You can’t teach heart the kid had the most pressure you can give someone and performed better than former multi weight world champions (Linares,Loma) and finished Campbell that’s as impressive as it gets and it was againts a real fighter that actually weights 135 give Garcia his respect.
Man props to him for coming back but i just dont see him beating tank he needs to work on his defense or else davis is putting him in a body bag
Hector tarajara vs Ryan Garcia make the fight happen
Ryan was born in my hometown Victorville CA and is friends with my brother Timothy
3:28 Oscar better keep this kid far away from Gervonta. Imagine the exact same left from Tank. He would be asleep
✊🏻respect.
Ryan needs to fight Devin first. He got the win, but still needs to improve
Garcia has heart and talent, but he should take this fight as a learning lesson.
Impressed how well Garcia cameback he has heart. I think Tank sleeps him thoo.
Ryan doesn’t look as sharp as he did 9 months ago
That’s the worst job I have ever seen at finishing someone off. Campbell had no killer instinct. Garcia was done.
Tank can take him fs
If this fight doesn’t make you give respect to Garcia then idk what does
WhenYou have oscar 💰💰💰💰in your corner you will win
Letssss goooo
Ryan vs. Loma ASAP!!
He's lucky Luke didn't finished him
I picked Campbell to win but Garcia proved me wrong
He can’t get threw Davis or Haney after this😂
Ryan Garcia showed heart out there 💯 that kid gonna be here for a while
I love Ryan but I’m sorry if Campbell dropped Ryan and he barely has power Tank is gonna sit Ryan down Tank hit TOOOOOO hard and he is fast af and he can take a punch Ryan not ready for Tank yet he gotta get more composed and get more grudge matches
"He bounced back like a true champion" Mayweather
Even Luke Campbell shocked himself when he Knocked down Ryan 🤣
Ryan do not fight tank Davis yet, wait till you have more fights like enjoy. Don't do what Canelo did before please.....
With ALL RESPECT Ryan deserved that knock down. But I knew he was going to come back and take this W👑
Devin and gervonta hasn’t beat anyone Ryan is the one ahead rn, Ryan has now beat Campbell but who has Devin and gervonta won?
Ryan Garcia vs Jake Paul
He gone have trouble with tank or deven
Too soon for Tank.
Well I now know this much.  He will not walk thru Tank!
If you kissed your sister read this
You gotta give credit where it’s do 👍
atleast ryan didnt do the nate robinson
I respect Ryan Garcia for getting up after the second round knockdown ✊🏽
No jaw Ryan....ephemeral career for this kid...
Came back and took the W👏🏼
Props to Luke for sharpening Ryan up
Ryan scared me when he got knocked glad he still won👏
Commentary was horrible. He was barely winning the fight and still showed his mediocre defense and head movement. He’s not ready for the champs at 135
Ring walk like a king😩😩😩😩 😁😁
but he wanna fight tank?
Ryans Offense is Great, His defense esp in the Head movement department leaves A LOT to be desired. Certainly needs to work on his defense
Chin don’t lie. Tank touches it and Ryan is in wonderland
wow.
Tank is still beating him🥱
Never been this early
Okay, okay, okay.... This kid has potential
THANK YOU DAZN!
3:28 Ryan’s defense is mediocre. Imagine that shot from Tank or Lopez
Huge respect for the kid. Im really looking forward to his future fights, he proved himself here
DAZN challenging Ryan for faster hands🤔🤔🤔
This is what I love about Dazn, they always post the highlights the same day
Viva mi gente🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
showed his heart but man against heavy hitters, eager to know how he will handle those punches. Great fight by ryan excited and happy for him
Tank gonna put him to sleep longer than leo . he do have heart though i give him that
Took big shot and came back that Mexican style boxing 💪🇲🇽
Respect for luke
He ain't beating tank
Ryan needs defense tank will ko him at this skill level hes at rn
Where at the haters at?? He got rocked and still won every round after that, and then did that.
Still waiting to see the Ryan haters point out everything, kid has heart, knocked out a REAL fighter now.
Ryan a beast.
Fair enough just needs to work on defense
Big props to Ryan for getting up and getting the KO. But for 2021 he needs to stay away from Teo/Tank. Ryan gets too excited after landing a punch, flat footed, and leaves his hands low for too long.
No Head movement! No Foot work (Garcia)
I'll KO Ryan Garcia any day
I didn’t even Trip when he got knocked down it’s Ryan Garcia we know wassup with him
Who won da fight
Ryan needs to improve his head movement which I'm sure he will since he's training with the P4P King Canelo
Gang Banging
Kid loves to prove people wrong I give him respect
Jajaja shows jajaja
What are they gonna say now😂😂 RYAN IS THE TRUE GOAT💯💯💯💯🔥
Ryan Garcia showed a lot of heart tonight, HOWEVER if he steps in the ring with Tank Davis...that boy’s going to get his head knocked off his shoulders!! 🚫🧢
Absolutely gutted for Luke but congrats to Ryan!
Finally a great competitor for Ryan!! Let’s go Garcia !!! 🙌☝️ much respect to Luke Campbell for giving a great fight!
Garcia used that Canelo shot to the liver 💪
He wasn’t hurt . He was just flat footed. I’m so confident if he wasn’t he would of ate the punch
Cool hand turned purple after that body blow
This kid is objectively the real deal
I’ve been wanting to see since Ryan got  knocked down
Really didn't expect him to drop campbell let alone ko him. Ryan impressed tonight
Eddie Herns failed dreams. Everyone Hearn supports get deatroyed
DAZN is employing former Jimmy John workers. Scary fast uploads.
Ryan Garcia showed that he’s legit. Tank vs Garcia 👀 ?
Where are the haters at?
Dazn came in clutch with the highlights
Shoutout to the DAZN social media team for uploading these highlights so fast 💨
Ryan needs head movement and way better defense. Otherwise Tank Teofimo and Haney all beat him
That punch was soo fast it looked like Ryan barley punched him😭
Wasn’t expecting he was gonna get knocked down
Amazing fight
I’ve been refreshing the page for so long finally
Nice
Let’s go Ryan!
who wants Tank
Who else been waiting  for this video
YESSSSSSSSSS
🐐🐐
RYAN THE GOAT!!! TANK IS NEXT
no
I want to see the full figut
“It aint about how hard you can hit, it’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward” 🔥 great fight
Ryan Garcia should've won
Props to Ryan for getting back up and getting that win. But if it was Tank Davis who hits him with that, it's night night for sure.
Yesss I get it free
I been waiting for this.:)
Finally
everyone still gon hate on ryan and call him corny lol
the editor is the real winner here he has faster hands then ryan
I'm so proud of Garcia
Ryan did what he said 👑 here comes Tank!
Next is Garcia vs Davis 🤩
KING RYAN!! going through everybody
Garcia is too flat footed with no upper body movement,
Really shocked about how Ryan cameback after the knock down. Kid has heart.
Campbell fought really well. Props to Ryan for shaking off the knockdown and hitting the liver. Wish him the best.
ryan’s the best light weight rn idc, and yes he will beat tank
Not so bad for an “Instagram Boxer”. This kid is legit
Should have used that twisted tea 🤷‍♂️
i didn’t think he was gonna get back up after he got dropped but he proved himself 👏🏽
I still think Tank stops Ryan 🤷🏾‍♂️
PRIMER COMENTARIO
King Ry......stay faaaaaaaaaaarrrrr away from Tank Davis. You not ready. Put some more time and work in
