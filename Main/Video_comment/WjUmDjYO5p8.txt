Your “portion control” explanation >>>
The “relationships should add to your happiness” line is something I remember to this day. Helps me with breakups, immensely. Breakups still suck, but I can land on my feet from them nowadays.
People who have never been in these types of relationships don't understand how hard it can be to leave. Everyone is on outside can see this is clearly an abusive situation and is like "its so easy to leave" "why do you keep going back to him?" I've even heard people accuse a victim of this abuse of liking it or being drawn to a "dangerous life style" while someone who has been in this type of relationship and stayed with that guy for a year knowing damn well what that current victim is going through and knowing damn well the other person has never been through that kind of relationship. Its harder than you think to leave sometimes and there are many that never make it out so please don't blame the victims of these situations for not getting out.
HUH
Waaaaaaaaawoe
Bro my Besty’s toxic ex literally went out with her recently asking her to be a character witness for him in custody court because he wants full custody of his kids so he doesn’t have to pay child-support to his current ex she obviously said no because one she was a horrible person to her and to she had information back to get custody taken away from both parents she has a full assault before against the mother of his child because the girl literally came to her town and tried to attack her in public and the whole time responding with girl I don’t care you can have him The funny thing was is that his ex did this because she saw that she was messaging my best friend but obviously she never looks at the chat because she would’ve seen that literally every time she reached out to my best friend she would block him and then he would immediately make a new account just to do the same thing all over again
It's not texting back and forward it's back and forth😅
Have heard horror stories swoz the door thing is code word for getting punched
"It's either me or your family." By that time I thought: "Neither."
1:20 me wishing it were 20 mins
Ghost herrrrr
I know I shouldn't be writing this, but I need some advice.  I've been in a relationship for five months. I loved my partner very much, and I would do whatever he asked to make him happy and tell him everything about me. But I've noticed something: he doesn't like to talk to me about things that concern him, and when I ask him, he tells me he has trust issues. Sometimes he asks me for inappropriate photos, but when I refuse, he accepts it , But I started to notice that I was being manipulator. I'm afraid to tell him how I feel because I don't want to lose him.   (Reply please)
I’m ashamed to admit I’ve gotten a black eye from a door
Bro I needed this ty
When i was a teen, i tripped and got a black eye from a door handle
Have you tried telling her to tone down the clinginess? It feels like a minor redflag that can be worked out to me
If the door is opened fast enough, I can cause a black eye(or very bad bruising) I got one in kindergarten cuz my dumbbutt ran into it full speed.
doubting her story of domestic violence is insane. a door swinging open with enough force will absolutely give someone a black eye.
Swoozie would never
In theory a door can not give someone a black eye but it can give someone a black eye depending on the angle the person face is
l cant find the toxic friend video did he delete it?
you wonder why you can't find a loyal girl, they're busy in a toxic relationship and is too loyal to break up
I dunno if someone has answered this already, but yes, it IS possible to get a black eye from a door, but you have to hit it a specific way. Or in the girl's case, it has to hit HER a specific way.
Portion control dont get it ?
Anyone know the girls real name?
sWooZie is amazing to be honest. The whole thing, though with the black eye, the only way you could get that with the door is from two things, either you were hunched towards the door knob or if she had her forehead leaning towards the door and it was tilted just my analysis, but yeah.Hope you’re doing well dude. Stay safe and peace.
Little Omie Bro has over 8 million subscribers yeah OK Little you’re right bro
8:55  Maybe the door hit like the top of her eye socket (like where the eyebrow is) and it kinda just bruised the general area around her eye??? That’s the only thing I can think of. 🤷‍♂️
K.J.
Swoozie: 12:05: cackle Me: * cacklesssss for 30 seconds straight *
wow...
They Forced you to do things you dont want to , gaslight you to make you believe in their lies that " things " are what you wanted .
Bruh!!!  Misery loves company .im in it now!! lol
For me a door gave me a scar in between my eyes 😅😅 Soo.. yeah
Once I was running in the house when I was 5 and I was near the bathroom door, and my mom opened it and the door slammed into my face and gave me a black eye
bro they went from breakup to marrige real quick
0:25 the voice name me laugh lol
and i’m back again.
Wish I came across this video earlier would have saved me 14 years of my life
I hate toxic relationships (btw I’m never been in a toxic relationship)
Omg skbidi toliet rizz swoozie
brooooo how you not wifed up by now? you've had like 30 girls already
The door story *could* be true, *COULD*, mainly because one time I was walking from my room, my sister was being oblivious asf, and she threw open a door to get a vacuum and hit me in the face, and I did get a black eye… although, she did hit me pretty hard, so even if it was accidental, it would’ve been a pretty hard accident..
No. Her bf laid hands on her bro  Aint no way a door can do that to your eye when you have your eyebrows sticking out theres parts of your face that are longer  A door hitting you will cause pain in the side of your nose or the eyebrow  It has to be persice punch or an object bro ….get her away from him
I swear I really wish I had forced my friend to watch this video when it first came out. Even back then it would have been too late since he already married the toxic chick. But if you have a woman hitting you in the balls whenever you happen to be talking to a woman you've been friends with since you were 8, then you should lose them. If they tell you that you cant go to the gym because youll get too good looking for them because they arent going, break up with them. I swear the chick had so many red flags and I even conronted him in person and broke down crying begging him to break up with her, I even told his mom, and nothing worked, so I doubt showing him this would have kept him from tethering himself to that sinking ship. But maybe it would have got him thinking more and made the signs more obvious to him. I dont know.
It’s ashamed you didn’t hook up with “Ann”. She definitely had a heart of gold and a loyal person. Rare trait in this day and age. Given that she was attractive, a gamer, had personality, and had simped hard for you. That is a unicorn bruh. Such a shame for her to be wasted on shitty and racist dude.
I know this was 3 years ago but I'm trying to catch up on Swoozie's videos  (he's got ALOT of videos lol) and Swoozie, your videos are very interesting and I always learn something from them, this video gave me better insight on the mentality of some people in these relationships, I've seen this happen so many times with family and people I connected with and have spoken to.   There was one girl in particular that has this same problem, she was a Young Filipina Girl in her mid 20's, (I'm not gonna say who she is) but she was very beautiful and an trained to be an Air Pilot, I met her and talked with her before. But to make a long story short, I saw her one night sitting on the side walk outside crying, I came up to her and asked her was she ok, she told me what was going on with her Father ( who was Caucasian, so she is half Filipina) and she moved miles away from him and he did some vicious things to her (he hated the fact that she out of all his children, 3 to be exact, looked more like her mother which is full blooded Filipina) she also was in a very toxic relationship with her black boyfriend (this is important because this is also one of the reasons her father disowned her, yeah he is a racist)   I sat next to her and listened to her the whole time just letting her get everything off her chest (no pun intended) and when she told everything she did for her boyfriend and what he did for her and why she stays with him, I asked her, "Did he ever tell you he loves you?" At first she kind of evaded the question but said "Well yeah he does love me" and I said "That's not what I asked, I asked did he ever say "I love you? Did he ever tell you that? She thought about it for a couple of seconds and said "No, he never did" After that me and her talked some more I cheered her up, made her laugh and she hugged me before we parted.  However Swoozie, the last time I saw her about a week after that, she was walking from the store and we crossed paths, she looked like she was in the darkest place, I tried to talk to her and she gave me this look like warning me to back off like she was going to explode. I left her alone, let her sort things out. In the end, she left the city and I found out later from a neighbor that also knew her, she left when her and her boyfriend got into an argument and he broke two of her ribs. Yeah, that was a horrible ending. I didn't know how else to help her man, I did cheer her up that one time and she considered me a friend, but I couldn't do anything else. I hope I see her again someday. Great video Swoozie! 👊
He hit her period
I believe she wanted to see you if you liked it enough to rescue her, but I admire your caution, I most likely felt in that trap
you fumbled that wifey
The moment he said talking about how she got a black eye because of her boyfriend, I said out loud: "Oh hell no."
a gangsters
THIS WAS EXACTLY WHAT I HAD TO GO THROUGH LMFAO
i think a door could give you a black eye
here after the imalexx allegations
Me knowing swooshes gives the best relationship advice😂
I don’t get why she didn’t accept your offer on living in LA with you paying, Idrk what people would think when they go through that. I’m just curious
She WANTED THAR SWOOZSS
"Ive been in a toxic relationship once or thrice"
As soon she refused your offer, I knew she was a red flag 🚩
^¥<>
This girl is cray-cray.... I'm willing to bet a lotttttt.... she's a big part of the toxicity going on.  Swooz I'm guessing you dodged a bullet here (so to speak). I mean i can't be sure but this really sounds like this chick, as kind hearted and great a person she may be in many ways..... is a biiig mess of drama.
I have got hit the a door 100 times and that does not happen
Swoozie I love you bro ur like my therapist I need someone to talk to about my relationship can we talk pls?
She wanted to stay with you bro!!!! Swoozie keeps fumbling his future wives
As much as I love swoozie, when a girl makes you mouth OMG when you meet her for the first time and on top of that, she a cool person and you get to make out with her. And on top of that, she's in a crappy relationship and you want to help and she's willing to do CHORES around the house for you and you stiil say no... I DON'T CARE if she's clingy AT ALLLLLL. Sorry Swooz, you fumbled the bag, HARD.
14:07
@9:44- that “wow” should really be a meme! 😂
Literally had this same situation bro swoozie gives such great advice bro
Dude I wish I had a friend like you. It took an ungodly amount of time to get out of my toxic marriage because I had no one to help and nowhere to go. I would have JUMPED at two free months in LA to get my life back. Good on you for trying.
0:59 bro my dad had to experience that and he picked me💅✨️
I’m Aroace and this has actually really helped me with friendships (it’s similar signs) and I honestly think this is one of the best videos on toxic people that I’ve seen in a while
blud really put on a phadora to speak about a gamer girl
The black eye story seems sus. The only way I can think of getting a black eye from a door is if she was hit in the nose on impact. But that would give her 2 black eyes
Technically if the door was to hit the side of your nose or high on your cheekbone it COULD give you a black eye, but usually if it’s the nose you get a wide spread “black eyes” situation
Respect my friend
Some people thrive off of toxic relationships because it's all they know. It's what was modeled for them, it's what they grew up experiencing in their own relationships, so to them that's how true love is truly displayed, with fervent passion. Unless they do some internal work to change that, there's little you can do to pull them out of there. Only thing you can do is be a shoulder for them to rest on when they've had enough. I suspect that was your friend. But man, bullet DODGED!!
Swoozie, you good, what happened to your animations, they getting kinda sloppy
Swoozie, you can get a black eye from a door. I’ve done it to myself. I wasn’t paying attention, turned around and slammed into an open door. It hit the side of my face, where the pocket of the eye meets the cheek bone. I hit it so hard, even though it wasn’t exactly my eye, I had a black ring all the way around the eye where it was swelling up.
I was once in a toxic relationship where I was toxic Because he was toxic :P
It has happend to me before
Tbh i wouldve let her stay bro. Toxic relationships are not fun at all
I predict...a riot😂
It’s so unbelievable how happy you can be if you just block the problem
I wonder if he's done one with toxic family members
I know this is for kids but obviously he's paying all her bills so that's why she keeps coming back.
Ugh cute/pretty girls can be single and noting is wrong with them. This dude ain't even all that. I blame all these chick's for blowing his head up
I once had a toxic ex. We were in a situationship. He always spoke down to me like as if I was a child who's incapable of making decisions and treated me as a toy or an object for sex. Forced his desire for sex down my throat and constantly told me that I liked it or enjoyed it sexually. How tf am I supposed to know if I'm being gaslighted constantly in this sense. And whenever he fucked up, he pointed fingers at me saying that it's my fault to hide his shame. When he made a joke of me, I lost my shit and was done with the fucker. Just so fucking done. He disrespected my boundaries, invalidated my feelings, made me feel even shittier than I've ever felt in my entire life. I just wish I could rewind time and not meet this selfish, arrogant, narcissistic jerk of an arse in my life.
Funny I just watched simps😂
duuuuddddeeee. I feel like I am you in this story so much!
Swooz how you using my name???? Of all names bro😭
Apparently it possible to get a black eye from a door
you are so good
How'd it take me 2 years to realize he had the best fit in this video
The same thing is happening to my mom and dad. 😓
we need an update on this story
might be the doors that have those handles that are not normal knobs if you know what I mean.
Who would turn that down..I would love that yes if I was struggling❤❤
That's a 30 day lie😂😂😂😂😂she hoping yall fall in love and she can stay....
I don’t think you should be “making out with a girl a lot” whatever that means and then complain that she wants to communicate with you a lot afterwards.
G.I.R.L - Guy in Real Life
yo MS paint, that's hard swooz 😂 😂
Swoozie is the only reason I understand women, and now I’m getting a girlfriend because of you bro.
didn't watch you videos for a few years watched one now , dude you completly gave up on the animations
A door can give you a black eye. If it hits the side of the nose or the side of the head. 😢
the one thing you should never do is forgive a cheater just cut ties with them she needs to have respect for herself
Lol my bf says I'm the worst liar in the world and just stares at me and shakes his head and laughs a bit
naaaaaaaaa he hit her
Love it! Know your value and add tax.
I’ve got a doorknob to the eye from kneeling down in front of it, though that was the perfect circumstances, also, you may be one of the kindest people that I don’t know yet
0:54 i like the joke there where the song "toxic" starts playing
I had a GF who broke up with me bc I didn't text them enough
Bro I like that portion control analogy
Sounds like a girl i had a crush on, i get crushes easily , but she was not clingy. But she would basically have dramatic stories regularly about a few guys she was interested in. The wake up call to me was when she told her ex or current boyfriend at the time she was having a potentially lethal sickness (a lie). Later the boyfriend told her parents and they were genuinely worried and want to help her. She would tell me and few friends she will not admit it was a lie.
She started the fight then she deserves that black eye.  How can a door give you a black eye, that’s something new 👀😂
10:17 …. What hair?
6:46 better name for it: beerio kart, doesn’t have to be beer but beer (or cider) is best so you don’t get obliterated
A door has given me a black eye
A lot of relationships are like the dark side of the force (or the force in general), it demands more than it gives.
Your outfit makes me sick
Lets talk how feminine you talk and act!!!
I had a friend that was and is still in a toxic relationship. His gf acted a lot like the bf in your story, she would force him to isolate from all his friends and take control of his social media accounts. Not to mention, over time, he would show up to squad hang outs less and less often until it was like a twice a year thing. My friend and I haven't heard from him for MONTHS and I got a bad feeling he won't return.   The saddest part is, he knows she's controlling but he keeps crawling back, even when they got into a fight and she threatened to leave. Now he's also blocked me on socials, so it's like yeah dude we clearly ain't friends. If he ends up unhappy with her in the future that's no one's fault but his (I hope that's not the case though).
Its sad that the story had no happy ending :(
Anns injury, let me explain so ann was leaning and her bf was kicking it right? Maybe ann loose control of the door and then bam.
The person I go there to see  is toxic and he don't even know it
Knock knock how is there the door
Mane i shoulda remembered this cuz now i’m left with bad mental health and anger ☠️
8:56, yeah you can, no joke I walked up to my door to see and you can, it doesn't take much effort either, if your holding the door, and your like leaned a little yeah it's possible but that would hurt like hell tho
Been in a toxic relationship with this girl and she was so toxic always saying she would change but the wierd thing was we were not even that Serious and she had no reason to be toxic she just was
"Know your value, and add tax" now thats powerful
BUT he does DISCRIMINATE  in BED!!!
Black eyes are possible from doors, but the force of that kick would need to be STRONG...
No… you know what’s not fun My ex lives at my dads house he doesn’t pay rent. He doesn’t have a job and my ex cheated on me and my dad still allows him to stay there so now I never go to my dads.
Too much to get an toxic like that man that was rto much
"Relationship should add to your happiness"...Been hearing you say this for probably almost a decade since i was a teenager...i think i finally kinda sorta get get it as an adult...Thanks man
"Babe, it's me or the boys" The boys all the way. Don't make me choose one, bitch.
Is Swoozie actually giving me frrrrr 💯 advice right now? Bro you are a legend. 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
During this last school year/my junior year of college I had a toxic roommate similar to this where she only thought of herself and made it seem like I was the bad guy whenever I stood up for myself and it was horrible. I’m very happy I no longer have to deal with her anymore after just living with her for a couple of months, I can’t imagine being in a whole relationship with someone like this.
damn... that sucks.. worse part about it is i know somebody basically EXACTLY with maybe even some what a worse boyfriend..      and even worse is the person with the abusive boyfriend.. is my mom. lucky shes a lil rude girl so shes atleast not that much liking him in the love way but they keep in contact for who knows why.
I’m sure it’s possible to get a black eye from a door but it’s common for ppl in abusive situations, even those who are aware that their partners are toxic or abusive to say they were hit by a door, fell down the stairs, etc.  I’m no expert but this has happened to friends/relatives of mine and it’s shitty, it’s like you don’t want to make other person “seem like” an abuser even if they did it, so you make excuses for them because YOU feel guilty.
Congratulations SwooZie you have now hit adulthood. You are now a man what does power you can pick up any fine female
Mmmm that hat👌
he really gave him the club penguin 6:10
My friend was in a toxic relationship with a girl she cheated on him blamed him for her cheating, used him, stole from him, showed no affection they have broken up 7 times and now their engaged.
"YOU EITHER CHOOSE ME, OUR YOUR FAMILY" girl, get out of my house, were done
ILOVE ONE PIECE
The one piece is real
Well if she was small the Doornob could of hit her in the eye around the eye idk but yeh if she was small Maby that’s what happened
10:10 fuck 30 days live wit me forever
I agree, but for me, it's about hypocrisy. You can't go clubbing with the girls and then bitch at me for hanging out with my guy friends. You also can't get mad at me for having female friends, but "he's just a friend!" with your male friends. This obv applies vice versa
He still incontact with her
What happened too the four day rule swoozie four days and then you’re out
Wooooow
I can't believe she was so gullible.  She seemed so lovely.  Oh well.
Each wow keeps getting better
Depends on the angle you fall at or run into something at. (My little sister has given her self one playing around on wet floors once and another in a door)
i dont have a toxic relationship
The amount of times swooize has said “I have to wife this girl” 😂 Love your stories swooize
Wouldn’t she have not got into that toxic relationship if you didn’t freak out that she showed you her feelings? I mean it’s kinda your fault?
Sorry, but im considering she's lying. It's weird she wants so many things specifically with you, and when you're not included, she doesn't want it. Sounds like she's trying to gain attention. Also its crazy that she can still be living at her bfs house when it's his parents house and they're broken up??
What if the doornob hit her in the face?
door knob
I should have listened to you when I dated my current ex. Pretty much describes my ex perfectly with traits. She never told me there was a problem and I didn’t know and when she broke up with me she blocked me on everything with no explanation
As much as Ann’s bf is toxic…  Ann is also toxic.   She has her own victim complex and has low self worth/self esteem. She has poor boundaries, only contacts Swoozie when she *needs* him, and is entirely dependent upon on a significant other/love interest’s approval or decision making.   She will continually end up with such abusive men because deep down she thinks that’s all she’s worth and doesn’t want to take accountability for her own life and choices. As much as she’s a victim to abuse, she’s also repeatedly victimizing herself and associating with more blatantly toxic people because that relieves her of reflecting on her own issues.
My brother started dating a toxic girlfriend and said that his upbringing wasn’t normal once he went on duty to Korea we lost track of him and don’t even know if he’s alive
She could’ve not made it into the restroom and got punched in the face
Black eye maybe a coat hanger something on the door.
"Know your value.. and add tax"   this line goes hard
Nothing you can do when people get brainwashed by a toxic partner..  I was in that situation myself...  You literally can’t hear people telling you to run…   It’s literally brainwashing..  And the being too clingy too fast is a huge sign of them having been in mostly toxic relationships..  They don’t know how to have a normal relationship. They want the love bombing that comes at the start of a toxic relationship... Hence the clingyness. 😢
Pokimane  Chika Nadia One of them fashor
I ran into a wall (pretty much a dore) and it gave me a black eye, sooooo I think its the truth.
I thought this story was going to turn into a... "and this is how I lost a Kidney" story...
Bruh.....  I will promise NOT to invade your privacy, do your dishes, do your laundry, ensure that I have nothing to do with your tummy, and guarantee a 100% 24/7 homie support plan for the low low price of a popsicle.... 2 months free rent sounds pretty dope too though tbh. 😅
she obviously has an anxious attachment style
If she had her head turned sideways ( like when a dog doesn't understand something);  and the door opened when it was turned, it might give hera black eye...
I think the real question is why didn't SWOOZIE pursue this girl??
When a woman begins to look at another woman it was toxic from the beginning
I hope that she actually gets out of it, there are just too many signs of abuse. Marriage isn't going to solve their problems, it'll add on to them.
Honestly I think Swoozie's offer to help her was great, she would have had her own space and more time to figure things out. I think she just wanted him to fall for her by being a perfect live-in girlfriend. She seems very co-dependant. A lot of beautiful girls have deep insecurities that jerks exploit, it's so sad.
All women are abusive. mens do not want to be in a toxic relationship and become victim of gender abuse.
cant believe he turned down what he's describing as a 10
door handle
Nah you can get black eyes from doors.
I’ve always been that friend who’s seen the signs of toxic relationships and wanting/helping my friends in these problems has been so exhausting and frustrating because they always crawl back. The good thing is that since I’m in high school I don’t have to deal with friends who are in toxic relationships/wanting advice just to crawl back but something I do wish and want people to take more seriously is that you shouldn’t find happiness in relationships. I can understand that we all want comfort and affection but if you keep finding happiness in relationships to be the cause in being happy that’s not helping you that’s hurting you more and most of the time people don’t know what they’re doing. I don’t mind giving advice but it’s up to you if you’re going to take my advice and be useful with it or just bluntly throw it the window and crawl back if somebody’s there to help at the end of the day it’s up to you if you want to help yourself or hurt yourself.
no ones talking about how shes clingy and wanting to stay with a guy even though he hurt her only because she didnt get enough love and affection as a kid so she looks for it in other guys the reason why she was clingy was because she felt ur affection and just wanted more im not saying she shouldnt give guys space to breathe im just telling yall why shes like that
yo he talking about amouranth? 🤣🤣
It is possible to get a black eye by a door I know from experience
Lots of different types of doorknobs. The shapes and sizes...it's possible to get a black eye. This is info from a very clumsy person prone to constant injuries.
The more swoozie vids I watch, the happier I am to be single. It seems the only plus side to dating is having an interesting story to tell when it's over.
A door can give you an black eye, it just depends on how she was standing and the angle in which the door hit her. Its not like it was direct. Yk??
You tell me anything to do
Bro im ten and im  rough
when I was with my ex we were haveing a rough time and I asked for a day to myself and to get me to show her attention she pretended that her neighbor did you know what to her. yeahhh she was toxic to say the least.
When you said “I mouth the words OMG” I did the same thing 😂😂😂 as you narrate lol
8:50 yes you can get a black eye from a door it's actually not as uncommon as you would think.
Dude, I knocked myself unconscious by hitting myself in the face with the door. The next day, I looked like Braveheart!!! You CAN get a black eye from a door. It will match the whole entire side of your face, which will be one solid bruise. Plus you get a razor sharp line down the middle of your face!
A door can give her a black eye
I love swoozies storys but I just want my guy to find the gal he been waiting for and to be happy ngl
legend, another great video 👏🏾👏🏾🐐
I definetly feel your struggle one of my good friends is just like Anne in the sense that she's gorgeous super smart (academically) and kind she's clingy too but she's stuck to this one hella abusive guy like a barnacle and I just don't get it. Like she could get any guy she wants she's that beautiful plus she has good character let's herself get treated like trash by this dude.
Yo that was so meadowed like not even joking. Because my ex would be like you either choose your family or you choose me. I'm like bro i'm obviously gonna choose my family
My big brother he is like 25 he dated a girl for 1 year guess  how much I saw him, once and that was when she broke up with him because he wanted to see his family
Ever since the breakup that was a hard hit, emotionally, I told myself I won't ever display jealousy again. I was bad. Now, I keep it controlled nicely. My wife actually wished I show a bit of jealousy but I got it on locked lol
doors do be like that though......
POV her: omg stoooooop❤❤❤
You are indeed wrong, a door can give you a black eye.   just ask my sister last weekend lol
I’m at 11:29 and if I were her I would have jumped at that offer of two months free of rent. Do you know how much you can save in two months rent free???? She’s trippin. She wanted to give you wife treatment for supposedly 30days, and then leave. Yeah i don’t think she was gonna leave in that 30days
I think the door would have given her a broken nose… not a black eye
So doors have sharp edges And on your nose so that door hit exactly the door probably gave her a blackeye by that the side of your eyesocket so that’s why 😀
I hope your friend is ok a year later, those situations can end up with the partner dead.
bro i just left my girl to just watch your video bro XDD
Everything reminds me of her...
Since when did Swoozie start dressing like a street magician? 😂
What if your family is toxic?
You both fumbled 😭😭😭
doenst it make sense for her to stop talking to you since she has possible feelings for you and with someone. Thats emotional cheating on her guy
…suddenly all these years of sucking at chess finally makes sense to me. No wonder I’m a mess lol.
nigga.. 4 years ?? 😭😭
people who like pizza over tacos  |  |  | \/
I was friends with someone who was ALWAYS in a toxic relationship(she was the toxic one) n i feel so bad for the boyfriends cuz they be the sweetest mfs n she screws them over just bc she gets bored. She fr went thru 7 bfs in 4 monthss.
pls do a toxic parents video too, I'm all ears on that if you want but I would really like to see that too,  keep it up bro!!
I got your bottle theroy bro.  Thank you for it.  Ps. It wasn't the door. Trust me.
Mgtow
The last person I’m trying to be friends with is someone I used to date
Ok so the strength of the man and the door Strength doubles so that’s possibly how you get a black eye from a door
The Door Forgot To Door
All my friends are toxic
Good talk, I just got outta one. They always turned everything I say are problems around on me and said I was the problem.
I had a toxic ex girlfriend, she basically wanted me all to herself, talk  Everyday even if I was working she had trust issues.  And she broke up with me because of a compliment
Yes door’s can give you a black eye
You are weird man. You claim you like this girl and shes amazing but then you ghost her and only text her on her bday? You all bout that drama huh.
You can save a toxic *relationship*, but a toxic person can rarely change. If your relationship is toxic because of outside forces or a lot of misunderstandings/mistakes that's one thing, but if someone is drama they're always gonna be drama
A wooden door can but all other doors can't, i know first hand don't ask how I know.
Just wanna say, last year, I opened a bathroom door into my face while super drunk. Ended up with a black eye that looked like a bad eyeliner job.
she was tryna trap him in a relationship
Why did I read  Ra Pis(t) Istead of Pa  Ris
A door has given me a black eye, however, it must be on the side more of a black and blue on the bone around the eye.
I think a door would scrap your face up if it hit you rather than a black eye
what she gat is a little something called a brues dude
Bro, that sounds like heaven, and you chose not to take that offer?? It might just be me but you kinda crazy for dat
Swoozie always here spitting facts that I need to hear. These videos are always my go to when I need to better myself
I would have toxic relationships with friends but first I need friends.
… I am a real as*hole aren’t I

I got a black eye for a door knob so if she is small ig she can get a black eye
I once had a toxic gf who was almost exactly like "Ann's" bf. She would hit me, racist parents(she was white I'm hispanic), and she cheated on me yet I was always the one she was suspicious of. I did so much for that girl and regrettably took her back several times. Luckily I got my shit together and got out of it but even though I saved myself I still have lasting trauma from her
thats's crazy
It could be possible the doorknob hit her eye
yes a door can give you a black eye it happendd to me
The only possibility of getting a black eye with a door is the door nob
This guy is delusional. It makes him look immature and essentially a man-child.
U dodge a bullet...Good 4 U!!!
Bro him yen he here's they married him right now bro I'm dead. 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Bob died a long time ago he was my neighbor who is the best rest in peace Bob😢
Door nob corner of the door it happens
Jokes 9n you got no relationship hahha 😂😂😂😂😂😂😐😐😐😐💀💀💀💀
Nah unless dis girl shorter then me and hit her face on the doorknob then nah fam she crazy
Bro.... You fumbled this bag😭 You shoulda wifed her ass when you had the freakin chance 😭
yes
I'd say you can come over just don't do ALL of that.
0:54
nah it can happen i accidently gave my friend a black eye with a door in 5th grade
This girl I know told me a couple months ago that she has to block me on everything because her dad found out she talks to boys, I still wait for the day she responds
For how wise Swoozie is, he seems to be in a lot of failed relationships
this is not it!
Always remember to pay your taxes
Idk if anyone else has said this, but you can get a black eye from a door if the doorknob hits your eye. It happened to me, didn't get a black eye but it happened and it hurt like crazy, depends on how hard the doorknob hit you
14:11 Get happy first before you get in a relationship  Learned this the hard way but it’s very true
Imagine her boyfriend being Eric  the toxic friend
I know a girl like this and it makes me very sad
hes gotta be talking about amouranth
You can get a black eye from a door slamming your face if your face is turned, I know because I was playing hide n seek for with friends and they slammed a door into my face
Okay idk about that situation, but I can confirm doors can give black eyes. Me and doors got beef

Do toxic parents next
That’s the thing about having a big heart, when it’s controlled it’s miserable
Probably the corner of the door hit her in the eye
Bro has the same kind of friend circle’s like me 😂
None talking bout how you can get a black eye from getting hit by a door (depends on how sensitive your skin is and on top of that it doesn’t need to actually hit your eye)
Yes you can I get a black eye from a door I’ve done it before
So stylish
I have a question are you gay or straight
Honestly this vid helped me realize some problems I have too work and out. Thanks man, Great vid.
0:25 immediately thought of rutabaga from Bojack horseman when I heard that
My dad had to wear a eye patch because my brother was chasing him with a nerf gun, and he ran into the pantry door
Homie definitely texted him to say that 👀
Idk maybe the door knob or handle hit her
I have been in like 5 or 6 toxic relationships before and it still hurts me to this day so stay safe guys👍
Idk bout you but I'm going, kicking his door in and kicking his ass
8:59 I have never wanted to hit my face with a door so much before.
I just think u have bad selfasteam
We eye could’ve been next to the door handlw
13:44 Most likely its still awful, but the Victim still couldn't respect themselves as they believe that person comepletes them. From his parent being unwilling to have basic human respect despite their views, Him basically not caring for her wellbeing(as she never said anything about him helping her out of the eye, and apologizing for pushing her to far) And crossing the line in cheating, this relationship is never ever getting fixed. Maybe she was able to "Fix Him" despite the odds, most of the time it's better to just give yourself respect and find some else who will aswell.
i just googled if a door ould give you a black eye and it can so- idek
Hi my name is is ruby  and my dad side doors CAN  give you a black eyes bye the way I am a big fan
i hit mi self with door xD and no black eye
Love you but I feel like people who are “fine “ w themselves tend not to Tolerate a partner. Everyone will hurt you, you just have to want to love them enough to work it out
it dapens on the angl of the obgekt
Am i the only one thinking swoozie missed her signs? Like idk she wanted to stay at your place for 30 days.  And when you ended up offering her a better offer she declined?   This was at a time wanted to get out and the only diffrences between what she offered and you offered is that you wont be in the same house as her.   Also you said she was clingy maybe she was trying to be too likeable (i could be wrong i have no idea what she said) but i mean this seems like it. Again. I could be wrong
i just searched it up and you can get a black eye from a door, glad to tell u 2021 swoozie
females are unbelievable creature ....... hahaha😂
“The more the baddy the more the bratty.” -BlackBear
Swoozie it's the door handle
She probably got her black eye by hitting the door knob.
litteraly ANYTHING can give you a black eye
A door can give you a black eye if it hits you frome the side but it should also hurt your the side of your face
swoozie infinite rizz but 99%
Dude that’s a good deal, live in a apartment for 2 month free!
A door probably can't give you a black eye... but a doorknob that you are looking through for some reason can definitely give you a black eye.
Me and my friends were at a basketball competition and one to the girls on the opposite team kicked the door and it hit the girl in the face but she didn't get a black eye. She got a bug bump / briuse on her forehead. It seems like he punched her
I like how it went from notanstalker to B_O_b
But his dad tho, could he be brainwashed 😱???
You can get an injury by hitting your eye on a door but it’s very unlikely
I had a toxic boyfriend who kicked out the bathroom door, he was in the bathroom so I do mean he kicked the door out, it broke the frame of the door and that flew and sliced my ear, no joke... blood everywhere. If I hadn't turned my head maybe it would have hit my eye...?? So... it's possible. Maybe the door knob clocked her...? Or maybe she's crazy, blacked her own eye, trying to trap you... nothings impossible, right?
It is the sweling that casis a black
Hey swoozie I have that trait. My right thumb is bigger than my left. 😂 my family loves it lol
I'm just going to say one thing IT'S NOT THE DOOR
spread the gospel before its to late God and Jesus are real and there coming back soon go to church and receive the gift of God repent as well  Amen spread this message Amen may God and Jesus bless you turn to God and Jesus Amen✝️✝️
Every tim Swoozie make me laf I could be reach 😂😂😂🤑🤑
E
I'm in this problem rn I'm trying to get them out but they won't listen
If I had a nickle for every time Swoozie went over Toxic relationships, I'd have 2 nickles. Which isn't much, but strange it happened twice.
Hey can we be friends on Xbox?
Yo I'm not gonna lie, but looking back at this story, Swoozie really did fumble the entire bag on this one. She was basically simping for Swoozie and doing things to get closer to him cuz she was so into him. The clingy part might have just been apart of her legit loving him.  I love ya Swooz but damn that one is something to think about.
You are wrong i got a black eye from a door
I would like to personally thank you for reclaiming the fedora.
Hi from Latvija swozie
A Door Knob could but it was most likley a Fist...
If the corner of the door hits your face you can get a black eye but dookie sounds abusive asf
What's toxic is that hat
her face was prolly turned so the corner of the door hit her eye
Wow she that big into starwars
I’m pretty sure it is possible to have a door hit your eye, only if it’s the right angle.
The only possible way of getting a black eye from a door I can think of is maybe the door handle hits your eye. But even then I feel like that would leave a lot more than a black eye.
OMG I HAVE LIP FILLER TO
.. Ummm Imma be real with ya my boy... I couldn't hear nuffin with you wigg waggling the bandaid around... like we just gonna act like there ain't nothing there?
100000% shoulda had her come stay with u coulda had a great relationship
Bro fumbled the bag
I gave myself a black eye with a door once, it hit my brow bone but yeah full purple eye  It is possible
A broken nose could give you a black eye so maybe that had something to do with it
Those shoes bro
I like it, I look at the price, I put it back.
Swoozie all you need to know is what type of door was it if it's a wooden door that's a little thick it could hurt you I but if it was a metal door you would get a black eye
I know 2 girls that end up in the same situation I don't know if their respective boyfriends beaten them but I know that the cutest ones dated a mythomaniac and a stalker at the same time and them broke up with him and 2 years after she met a new guy and less than a year later move out with him and got a child together the other one who was more friendly well I never heard about her again I know that her husband was controling they bought a house outside the city and that's it  at the end I told myself their choices not my problem  I don't want to get involve in something that don't concerns me I'm still here if the want to talk and I'm not doing the first step
out here looking for flat faces
you look like a mafia member
Why would this lady turn down an apartment for 2 months rent free
OK I'm just gonna say this she was lying about that black eye that is way too specific but that part about the eye hitting a door is possible
Thats what happens to dumb men and women
spread the gospel before its to late God and Jesus are real and there coming back soon go to church a d receive the gift of God repent as well Amen spread this message Amen God and Jesus are good and turn to God and Jesus Amen ✝️
The door probably hit her from the side
stop calling women females
I don't see a door can give someone a back eye
spread the gospel before its to late God and Jesus are real and there coming back soon. go to church and receive the gift if God repent as well Amen spread this message Amen God and Jesus are good turn to God and Jesus Amen ✝️
Swoozie called his friend just so he can make a point 😂
it actually can, it happened to me.
if she felt the need to run from him then she gets a black eye  come on thats just obvious
Nothing but facts.
Nadia??
Stop playing around with random women you don't have the intention of marrying. Playing house is the reason relationships like this occur and why both parties will end up damaged at the end of it. Friends with benefits, or playing house is ridiculous unless you like leaving big holes in your heart when the relationship goes sideways. This isn't the end of the story, the real story begins after they get married and then realize what an awful mistake was made.   When you're going out with someone you better sus out before you get in a bed together if you want to pursue marriage with this person, WTH their family situation is, and who the hell their friends are. Ignore any of these... then don't complain about all the headaches you have down the road. Times haven't changed, people are doing crap out of order and then acting shocked that their life is mangled because of it.
Nah a door def can give you a black eye i was sleep walking an i ran into a door an i woke with a black eye
It was not the door in history of spousal abuse and accidents no one has ever gotten a black eye from a door.
I'll allow it
How does he not have aids
The door knob may of hit her or the corner of the door
You can like grab a door and put your face again it and open and close it against your face (slowly…of course). That’s what I did. My conclusion. If she was straight faced, it would have hit her nose. If her face was at an angle…eh I can see it, but I feel like it would hit the eye bone rather than the actual eye.
Sounds like she has a case of very severe co-dependancy. Poor thang :(
No she Got rocked in the face
If a door is you in the face it won't just give you a black eye it will give you splinters around that eye
2:49 for context  thats me and my brother
A black eye can happen when something strikes a person on the face. This could be a ball, a fist, a door, or another item. A black eye can also occur after some types of dental or cosmetic surgery. The bruising can last for several days.  google ha
Everyone talkin bout the door hitting her I’m shocked she didn’t nope out of the relationship when she got chased by this dude
Swoozie you could have easily wified her if you just got with her at that clingy time frame and then work around that rather than pushing her off to go cling elsewhere smh
who's name would be notastalker247!?!
Depends which eye and the direction the door opens
My gf said she would break up if I listened to Hispanic music
Yes swoozie, a door can in fact give you a black eye…. Okay no it can’t it is either a broken door smacked her in the face or she lied
he got that drip
Shes toxic all on her own, cuz from the story, something is wrong with her, from the beginning
ok
Ur interesting and funny but are u gay
Who is she
She one of those broads💀🤦‍♂️good swoozie
#1 youtuber
jeez swoozie why didn’t I just listen to you😔
About the black eye thing I got a black eye from falling on the floor from my bed 🛌
I’d only my mom could see this
Toxic!!!!
The Counter is a decent burger. Went there (in NYC) for my birthday once.
“Know your value,and add tax”                                               -swoozie
when their from Chernobyl 🤨
You can get a black eye from anything
I've gotten a black eye from a door before..  it sucked...
It's 1 of 2 things first it might have been the door nob second she gave herself a black eye and blamed the dude idk for sure but its what i think 😐😐😐
I just realized that girls profile name was not a stalker247 lol
Bro this guy is like the less loud less confrontational Andrew rate
Black eyes don’t happen like that a door doesn’t give you a black eye
What game was it?
Sorry I was just banging my head against the wall
When I said kick him in the balls I meant like with your foot but now I'm saying with a piece of metal
I would say you can stay here as long as you need I'll I'll do the cooking I'll do the cleaning you'll never have to lift a finger
Absolutely kick them in the balls
I say find who her boyfriend is and kick him in the balls
i got a black eye once from a door i walked into it really hard
13:35 was my exact reaction
me hearing all these toxic traits making me realize my ex-friends were toxic
Bro I wish I seen this video when I was dating a toxic girl I would have realized everything about her
and toxic religion!
I loved your videos I seen and child hood hero of funny
Take that damn hat off b
I’ve had a toxic friend he didn’t like me like playing with anyone else lol and then I decided to block and unfriend him forever
Dude, just found ur channel and watched a few videos and i gotta say, I like you. You are so self aware and got a great mindset. Gotta subscribe for this! great work!
jfc im horrible
hell na the door would hit your nose first so 🤡
You can get a black eye from a door
Does this stuff really happen or is this all online stories??? 😅 I need to know
"First of all, she's Backlit" I knew she was trouble when she walked in
Honestly, if I was in the position Swoozie was in when she asked to move in with him for a month, I would've said yes, it would've gotten Ann out of a toxic environment and probably would've kept her from marrying this guy
I've been there...
Love the hat swoozie!
the bottle explained that perfectly
Ok unless she’s the same height as like the door nob I don’t really think it can give you a black eye
Oh ya the corner of the door hits at just the right angle it can give a black eye. It can also give stitches, hit the wrong corner on a table, door and other square objects enough as a kid to know.
Super late but a door can give you black eye if your eye hits the handle you would have to be super short though
I've never seen a man fumble more opportunities with gorgeous women..Swoozie definitely holds the record for fumbling women and landing in the friend zone..there's no such thing as a perfect girl..it doesn't matter If she's clingy..what matters is...is she a good woman...I don't think your gay..but man come on Swoozie 😑😑😑
9:50 how she got his code?
This video just turned 1 year
I was going through something similar a few years ago. I wish I had this video then. People were kinda telling me what you were, but they framed it in a horrible way. Making it seem like I was the one that didnt deserve that person. However, they all told me since then that they were trying to get me help away from them. They just framed it wrong and that made me feel like I had to cling onto that relationship for as long as i could because that was the best it would ever get for me. I'm in a much healthier place now though years later.
I can't explain why but I love Swoozie's video style of irl/animating a lot
I couldn't tell if you were wearing a thimble on your finger or a bandaid. I had to slow the video down because I couldn't focus until I knew... it's a bandaid XDD... ahhhh ADHD is a cruel mistress. EDIT: Also your comment of "No way someone as fine as you is gonna hit on little ol' me" ...... Are you not aware that you are fine as hell yourself? Look in a mirror! XD
Hahaha womens are like that. The problem is you dont get women mindset.
this is a great FREAKING video man i felt this in my core.
she was lying about getting hit with the door because it probably would have been on under and over the eye
I was opening a door whilst my mum was closing it and it hit her and she got a black eye so its possible
Just found out, im toxic asf
She would have the impact on her eye brow furthest from there nose and the bruise and swelling would spread to her eye 🙂
Me that never dated anyone
Just got recommended to me. The toxicity isn’t apparent to most people until it’s in hindsight. For me, I was in a relationship with someone I was toxic with, and toxic towards, I never realized how bad things were until it was over. And then I met someone amazing. She broke me out of my shell and the habits I formed from the past relationship. It took time and understanding, and a lot of reinforcement. But once I was brought back from that place and understood how to healthily talk about issues, everything became okay. 2 years strong, and pretty happy with where I’ve ended up. I’ll end this with the “best” you can do, isn’t the best for you. Just find someone you can be happy with.
i used google and yes a door can give a black eye
Love the hat
The one good thing about not being able to get into a relationship is you have no risk of getting into toxic relationships
humans dont have flat faces'' *cries in asian*
The eye color changes if it’s a direct hit to the eye not if a door hits them
a well placed door on your face could cause you a black eye
"Know your value... And add tax."  YES!!! Perfect analogy.
🎶  Take my breath away 🎶  lol instantly played
story about how this guy got baited
I had a fine chick DM me on fb , everything looked real didn't have any sings of catfish/scammer, but she texted me those words "hello handsome" and I instantly blocked her, not even a day later I randomly get a 90 block   on fb . I can only think what if now
there is shockingly 2 types of toxic relationships, the one being described in this video, love ya content mate, and the second type of toxic relationships is purely Black Widow based (to make it more understandable, its a kill to gain relationship -_-) my uncle had a stroke and the black widow he was living with isolated him and took all the devices away and hid them, as well as she arranged a forced marriage on him and just to have it divorced again, and after that he has gotten a lack of sleep based dement state,  Keep up the good work homie  as well as trying to resurrect my channel that just ended in a dead end loop hole, its at the point of the no recovery without help 😥 just to be humble, how could i get back up on my feet and recover the silence, any tips and tricks
YO, YOUR OFFER WAS SO GOOD. What would I do to be offered that. Wow.
I love you swoozie
Dude, where do you find all of these girls that feel the need to call you (their ex fling or whatever) and tell you all about their relationships and hook ups, lol 😂. I could never do such a thing, I find it so weird.. Like "hey dude, I know your really like me and what not, but you wanna hear about my new relationship with this guy that ain't you" 🤦🏻‍♀️ like wtf? 😂
i got a black eye from a door but i was trying to see if i could see through the lock when my brother opened the door, the handle hit my eye
That whole thing with the door reminds me of the Johnny and amber heard incidents she hit him with a door as well
Z#
"This girls FACE is gorgeous"    *All i see is a circle*
Swoozie: “You’re my friend. If you ever need help, I will be there for you.”  Also Swoozie: “No, I won’t let you crash at my place so you can leave your abusive boyfriend, only because you were clingy that one time.”
Wtf is with that nice guy fedora?
This story is sad 🥺
A door being kicked in can absolutely give you a black eye if you are like an inch or two from it being kicked in.  The thing about the orbital bone, is the skin around it is thin, an there are, as you would expect, a TON of nerves there.  Plus the eye itself is squishy-dishy.  I've gotten a black eye just from being punched on the cheek.  It can happen.  Doesn't mean the story is real or sus, but it CAN happen.
"Word?"     *"woooooooooooooow."*
Handover that Insta
A door can give you a black eye.
Bro like woah you rock that goddamn hat like no joke it is sick
God I want a clingy girl
yes door gave me black eye
depends how the door is shaped, but ive never seen a door like that in my life, could give you a black nose though
I know how to end really toxic relationships ,it's called a 5.56x45 round out of an ar-15
Is clingy bad? I like it 🤷🏾‍♂️ they just like you and want to be around you..
if the point at the top of the door hits u u can get a black guy but if its the side u cant get a black eye it will hurt but not get u a black eye
bro u gotta drop the instagram
A door can give you a black i
woooooooow *in whisper*
“If her left thumb bigger than her right thumb” killed me hahahahhaha
Man just described my life
Thrise” 13:47
I just got to say first of all, I love the way that you tell stories, and your style is so cool dude. I also wanna mention how that also happen to me as well I've been stuck in a similar situation before like that where the girl ended up eventually leaving and getting back with her toxic after I tried to make a move.
My brother used to work at the counter
Its possible to get a black eye or bruise from a door. I've walked into one before lol
I will never understand why a woman would stay in a relationship like that. It's very stupid to move in with someone out of state and get married to them when they've abused and cheated on you. I know people say it's hard to leave but if it was me, that first time a man puts his hands on me, I'm out.
Currently in this situation now.
Bruh she was offering herself to you on a silver platter, I mean it probably wouldn't have worked but personally I wouldve greeted her with open arms lmao
I’ve been hit on the check bone and it gave me the biggest black eye
Wow, I gotta say I feel for Ann. Obviously her relationship with Swoozie wasn’t great, but this second guy? It reminds me so much of one of my former friends (I’ll call her Julie) and her boyfriend, now husband (who I’ll call Drew). When they were dating, “she” slowly started cutting people out of her friendship group. I say “she” because the types of people and the way it would happen was highly suggestive that it was his idea. For example, she was still close friends with her exes because they ended on very good terms, but they were “cut out” first, then came the other members of the friend group who were still close friends with said exes. They only other friends it seemed like she was “allowed to keep” were the ones she’d met in uni with Drew and any of Drew’s friends. However, Julie would still hang out with a lot of us when Drew (before they were married) would occasionally take an out of town business maybe twice a year; idk if she was lying to him, but it was like the only time she felt safe. Any other time I asked her to hang out she’d say something like, “Not today because Drew is in town and he said he likes spending as much time together as possible.” Oh, he’s in town? You mean in the same apartment where you both live together and see each other every day (this is directed towards the SO, not my friend). From the moment they started dating—especially after she got engaged—, she’s changed her appearance because “Drew liked it better that way”, changed parts of her dream wedding because “Drew didn’t like that idea” (although that I kinda understand, I do think the groom should have some input on the wedding, but maybe not SO much), and suddenly moved her halfway across the country, which even further isolated her from her friends, and now her family. She hasn’t talked to me since her wedding, so I have no idea how she’s doing but I think of her everyday. I know she loves him and I know she is happy in her own way, it’s just so hard to watch. If you’re out there Julie, I miss you and I hope you’re okay. 💞
Not to diminish the severity of abuse because a threatining circumstance is still unacceptable. It is possible to get a black eye from a door or anything with an edge i gave myself Two in the span of 24 hours. Long story short i had a bathtub with a shower door and one day facing the faucet side I was sick with the flu so I fell asleep cause i had a fever and was cold but I slipped and my eye and cheek hit the rail . BAM black eye , Next day same reason thought I was being smart turned the opposite dirction, fall asleep BAM same thing two black eyes  both from the edge of the rail on the shower door.  my boyfreind at the time laughed at me but didnt think it was funny when people wre curious if he gave them to me.  ha karma MF
specific bruising would indicate whether or not she was struck by a door. Depending on where it struck her, it could have given a black eye...  regardless... THE DUDE CHASED her, KICKED the door, and she was-- I assume-- terrified. F that guy
Something that you could have done was allowed her to live with you but helped her get into a better situation like since she was clingy you could use that to make her spend time doing whatever it is she wants to do to make a living and by day 30 that goal that she made should be started enough to start her life in California. You said she played competitively so she could start a twitch. With your editing experience and personality you could've helped her make interesting enough videos to stay relevant and gain a large enough following to make a living off of it in time (because I know it takes way longer than 30 days to make a successful channel.)
Not gonna hold you u sold the bag
That had is straight fire.
The door can but it has to be absolutely perfect
My girlfriend manipulated me into being with her, then evey time we argue she says she never even loved me, then she gets mad when I ignore her after she says she doesn't love me. I'm also gay and I really just don't want to be with her anymore, but I'm too scared to tell her I want to leave. Help
That "wooow", love it
"ANd add tax!"
Swoozie:I mouthed the words omg nobody saw me The security guard watching from the cameras:👁👄👁
Play the video at 3:19 then paise at 3:21. Now put your hand on your chest and swear to your mother while commenting below what you thought he was gonna say.
waaaaaaaaaaww . . .
I fele like a sWooZie is like a big bro giving me relation ship tips😂😂❤️❤️
HE CHEATED ON YOU 12:15 🙃
The amount of time he said WOW
Yes, a door can give you a black eye bro. If you face is angled, it will be a flush hit. I know this because I've hit my face on a door before
What's sad is she probably thinks all the time about how she should of accepted your offer
The edge of the door hit her in the eye…
Having an eating disorder, portion controll is a complex topic to grasp at times
The way I hung out with my boyfriend with just us before we got together was very similar to you. We were supposed to meet at the mall he went in the cafeteria side and I went in the front cause that's the direction I was coming from. I was a bit late and it was like a movie. The clouds parted as he was turning around and a ray of sunlight hit him illuminating his green/blue eyes and I swooned hard. I had to catch myself because I didn't wanna freak him out.  Piece of trivia about myself...I love eyes so yea it wasn't hard to swoon like that.😁
She could have been knocked over by the door and the the door handle hits her in the eye
Sounds like a trauma bond :/
When a person (especially a woman) let’s off the clingy “you’re my everything” energy, it’s going to cause issues, or more accurately, invite issues. This is because messed up people like this girl’s boyfriend can take someone who’s beautiful and should be admired and appreciated, and they run with the clinginess, gaslighting the other party to believing they will never find a better person. This allows them to act however terribly they want because there is a stark lack of accountability involved. It’s rough, and it’s likely caused by past trauma and fear of abandonment on the side of the woman (in this case), and some past trauma in the form of a power dynamic in the man (in this case). These stimuli could be the cause, and the effects are toxicity. Hurt people hurt people, but hurt people can also rely to heavily on others, hurting themselves more.
You fumbled I'm ngl
thank you swooz.
I’m gonna go ahead and say that the door causing the black eye is pretty possible. I’m not gonna say if she was telling the truth one way or the other, but I’ve been hit in the face with a door, just not in the eye
I wonder if he’ll make a video on toxic families?
no, learned from personal experience, doors cannot give you black eyes
I have some realized new thing when you talk to relationship you are not thinking straight like  the part where the girl was talking about how she got a black eye from getting hit with the door time I got hit with a door it didn't give me a black eye but it didn't leave a bruise
He is someone to look up to. His experience feel real and understandable and even relatable.  It feels nice to find your channel.
Doors can theoretically give black eyes. Any blow around the eye, like eyebrow, side of nose, etc, can cause blood vessels to bruise. The trapped blood pools under the eye and stays blue because it’s trapped without oxygen.
I know I’m a bit late here but I have walked full speed into a pull door thinking it would push and got a black eye from it
“Girls this cute don’t talk to me” proceeds to have dozens of videos of cute girls being into him 😂😂
Family too?
Thanks! You’re so awesome sWooZie! 👏🏽🙌🏽🤎
My ex sent this to me when we broke up. I never did anything to her showed on this video and as a fact she cheated on me with some dude on roleplay. Any tips on how not to find people like her ever again?
NO REGRETS. Keep working, keep Trying, keep Moving. Make mistakes and learn but NEVER REGRET. I ain't perfect neither are you. Nobody is.
doors can give black eyes😢
My gf is very toxic bro ☠️
“Uauuu…”
Idk if you'll see this swoozie, but if you get hit hard enough near your eye where the muscles and vessels are connected you can get black and blue swelling at your eye. So like the eyebrow or cheek bone area.
I just got out of a relationship 3 months ago. And I’m still trying to somewhat recover and get over it. The thing is, I see him a lot since we’re in the same band.  He was very very emotionally dependent on me, in fact he was dependent on me for almost everything. Before getting into the relationship, he already didn’t love himself and relied on me for most of his self-worth and saw no problem with that. I was basically his mother and his therapist. He was way too physical with other people and most of his friends were girls. There was one in particular who I honestly hated. She was clearly into him the entire time, but he always denied it. 2 months after I leave him, he gets with her, and the next day, breaks up with her over Discord. Yeah, over Discord. Then they get back together 2 days later. He says I have jealousy issues when I’ve been told repeatedly by friends that I was just setting boundaries. He just makes me feel like a terrible person and doesn’t see any problem with not taking care of himself and blaming everything he does on other people. Never be afraid to leave someone.
So, you CAN get a black eye from a flat surface but it does depend on how bad you bruise. I bruise super easily so I've walked into a bar and hit my cheekbone/brow bone and the bruising covered my eye as well.
I communicated a problem to my ex and then she just acted like a different person like she hadn’t been texting me for months with that number and like I couldn’t just scroll up and see the evidence and then I broke up with her and she was a bitch about it
It's so funny&weird when you say "gotta wife this girl" and next thing we hear is 'a few years go by'... lol, your excitement sure likes to take its time, doesn't it! 😂 The girl sounds really nice, I don't really get why it was such a deal breaker that she came on too strong, when you liked her that much initially yourself. Wouldn't you be excited that she likes you back just as much? I get it that it can feel intense if someone is way more intense than you are, but surely you could talk about it but still keep seeing each other? You didn't have to break up over this. But perhaps I don't get the full scope of the picture because I don't know the whole story here.
Is she ok now? Hope he didn't continue abusing her...
I hate how euh, relateble this is
Wrong
Since you asked, yes, a door can give you a black eye. If the corner catches you in the side of the face (it  can if you're leaning too close to it), it can hit you hard enough to cause bruising that can extend over that side of your eye. Hence, black eye.  Accidentally gave my brother one like that when we were kids.
A door gives black eyes
I like your life lesson with the chess part
That was an admirable offer💗 shout out to your parents 💐 (I was thinking Airbnb for month but this was a well thought out offer)
💀💀💀💀
Yes you can get a black eye from a door whether it be you falling into it or somebody opening it up and hitting you but nine times out of ten when people say that it's not true
I'm pretty sure a door can't give you a black eye unless our faces are flat 😐
😓😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰
Yo Swoozie hop on Lichess with me so I can see how good you are
“Wooooooooow”
"Once or thrice" yes
A door gave me a black eye once
If I had a dollar every time swoozy said "I need wife this girl", I could afford a two Lamborghinis and Teslas
Hope that Anne is doing well, she deserves better
GIRRRRRRRL HOW COULD U PASS UP 2 MONTHS OF FREE HOUSING IN LA FROM A FRIEND! I’m fr worried about that girl I was in that place once but I got out. I’m still in a bad spot but if a friend offered me that deal I’d work my ass off those 2 months to pay them back!
"You didnt hear" scared me so bad. Dating violence is deadly 😢
'Add tax.' Goals.
Trust me, doors are pretty dangerous, I was 5 and my YMCA had big metal and thick doors. On my way out i was looking through the door and it slammed on my eye and threw me back. Black eye moment
“humans dont have flat faces 🤨”
Swoozie seems like such a good dude to be friends with. Not gonna lie, kind of jealous of his friends. You got a good head on your Swooze, don't ever lose it
9:00 I think he hit her and she wannet you to know he hit her but didn’t want to say “oh he’s abusing me and hitting me lols” but like in different words it’s like one time I got harassed a guy I know grabbed me and he was a part of my friend group and I wannet the other kids in the friend group to know he was an asshole so what I said was “omg did u hear? Bob (guy who grabbed, also that’s not his name) grabbed a girl from our grade what a piece of shit we should stop hanging out with him” anyways a few days later I told them I was the one he grabbed they literally say “oh, well” and just changed the subject, I still hang out with them just they don’t know I’m disappointed at them
Dude the only reason I be watching swoozie is bc he teaches me so many life lessons thank you swoozie
No From experience, no it didn't stop. It only got worse. & it wouldn't even surprise me if she no longer games or is allowed to go compete.
Word? Woooow
Your the best story teller ever
I need chess brain 😅
Bro, I hate that shit man....
im 100% sure a door can give you a black eye because a door slammed into my face and i had a black eye and my cheeks were blue and purple
Oh a door can for sure get ya. The edge of zee door.
do not underestimate a door
Did anybody else get the feeling this man kept a girl attracted to him for no good reason like a woman keeps a simp on a leash? Like who are you kidding? You guys made out and I'll assume probably had sex, she is not your friend man. Keeping friendly relationships and romantic relationships mixed automatically creates shit storms. That's like dating 101 : thou shalt not eat and take a shit at the same place. Getting this woman off the leash by straight up telling her you won't be together and cutting contacts is actually the fair move here. Not cutting contact is cruel with clingy people.
Your portion controlling part actually sick B)
I'll tell you what isn't toxic! Using Koinly for your crypto tax solutions!
Swoozies only L
A one piece skirt huh?.....a dress?!? 🤔🤣
She could have gotten hit by the doorbell??
Ryan Renyold shouldn’t have been in Good Guy , It should have been Swoozie because he’s the real good guy
Why am i watching this im single
My first relationship was with a guy who was really nice, but he was kinda clingy Called me everyday asking to hang out somewhere, and I just made excuses to not see him (he was also a bad kisser) So I told him it wasn't working out, and that we could just be friends, which he was fine with He's not really toxic, it was more my fault for not telling him I needed my space But we're good friends now

13:45  Swoozie: "I have been in a toxic relation ship once or *thrice*" Me: 💀
About the door thing I have actually gotten a black eye from a door when I was a kid- I was hiding from my friend playing hide n seek behind a door and I peeked to see where they were and my head was tilted and then my friend kicked the door open and the side of the door hit my eye due to the angle I was at- so yeah, you can get a black eye from a door but that boyfriend still sucks
So, to answer the question of "did the door give her a black eye" It could have given her a black eye buuuuut she would also get a bruise from top to bottom of her face  Source: i have been hit by doors a suprising amount of times in life
bro I really needed to hear your message, thank u sm <3
I used to have this best friend but I ended the best friend relationship due some reasons , but the girl and I were still close friends.  Then a time came where she'd be so rude to my friends and I,  if we were like hanging out.  Basically she said she was jealous or so.  She would say or do stuff that I would tell her I didn't like but she still kept on doing them,  it got to a point where I slowly distanced myself away from her and she'd be like oh do u have a grudge on me? (now by this point,  she said she wasn't jealous anymore and has accepted the fact that I don't want to be besties anymore)  And that made me feel more worse,  thinking that I was the one making wrong choices or so.  And she continued with her indirect insults to me,  and that was when I finally stopped like having those friend conversations to her.  She'd be the one to come and talk to me,  but in a forceful manner and i wouldn't even have the energy or mood to talk to her cause I'd be so angry or just upset at how she was behaving. (at times I even felt like I had to just force a smile so she can leave me alone,  or I'd force myself to answer her questions)  If she asked me like oh give me reasons why you don't want to be my best friend and I would literally give out like five or more reasons and the only reply I would get was like,  is that all?  Or like you aren't fair,  blah blah blah.  (she said I wasn't fair because I refused to do our handshake or fist bump or even accept a hug from her).  So it went on like this for like... Idk some months (3 or 4 months), I feel really,  tbh I'm not sure,  but when I see her,  I'd feel like just letting her not to see me.  And she'd try to get my attention.  So one day,  I was talking to one of her friends who she'd probs say is her bestie now (cause I heard her say it out loud). So I was talking to this girl and my ex bestie calls her from across the class and she goes there and I hear my ex bestie telling her friend, out loud, why am I hanging out or talking to her,  I should be hanging out with my own best friends cause I have them or so (I don't,  I have just been making new friends) .  Basically it made me feel upset,  because I wasn't even trying to steal anyone here.  Then the friend comes back and I ask if I am disturbing or affecting their friendship and she's like no.  Then this my ex bestie comes,  (don't wanna lie abt some parts so Imma skip).  Then I tell her she isn't being nice because she's now trying to be competitive and she goes like u rnt being fair as well cause a hug is a hug from everyone (I didn't like how she'd make the hugs so uncomfortable ). And I was like but I don't feel comfortable and u r being too forceful and she tells her friend that yeah, she can be forceful but I too am not being fair.  It made me sad realizing that she doesn't even try to at least understand my point of view.  So the next day,  I decided to end the friendship after getting some advice from someone the day before. Cause she literally made me cry (don't want hate,  just came to get advice.  And yes I can be emotional at times).  So I gave her a paper that stated I am ending our friendship and she's like so I shouldn't talk to you?  And I'm like we can but our relationship is classmate.   And surprisingly... She actually backed off.  She stopped trying to get my attention,  she stopped forcing me to "talk" to her,  basically she wasnt giving me a loud attention,  but I could still see her giving me stares or glances every now and then.  Then my anger on her,  I guess cooled down.  So on Friday (the one that just passed),  one of her other friends comes to me and says she wants to make my ex bestie jealous and I'm like uhm... Then she tells me that my ex bestie talks about me all the time and says she prays for me to succeed and all that.  And I'm like wait so does she talk about me in a good or bad way and the friend is like in a bad way, most of the time (saying how I hurt her by not talking to her and blah blah blah 😤😣)and I tell the girl that I don't care anymore,  because I don't go around backbiting about her, All I do is tell people (close friends, sister and cousins) what she does to me and how I feel about it.   So blah blah blah,  it is almost home time and she (ex bestie) comes to me,  shaking me,  saying in a baby tone,  talk to me or smtg like that.  Then she asks if I'm her friend and I say no.  She says to her,  I'm still her friend and she says she's gonna hug me (she didn't cause I declined and protested),  and deep down I actually want to laugh cause I'm not mad at her anymore.   Then the question ticks me,  I'm not mad at her,  so why don't I be friends again?  Then I realize that,  the only reason why I ended our friendship was because of the way she made me feel guilty and she wouldn't stop even after I told her several times to stop.  She'd even hurt me consciously or let me say deliberately and she comes some time later and says "sorry", but does it, again!!  The point is, I ended the friendship because of the negativity in it, that I felt.   Then I also realize that, she never did stop offending me because of my own interest,  she only stopped when I ended our friendship.  (idk if I'm making sense here😅). What I mean is,  she knew,  we both knew our friendship was thin and she knew that I was spacing her because I didn't feel right with her and I would tell her this.  So in common sense or generally if she had actually wanted to stay friends,  she would have stopped the things I told her I didn't like,  but instead she continued. And the only time she stopped was when I ended the relationship.  So  I came here to ask,  how to tell if she actually wants to be my friend like for real,  realzies, or if she is just being nice to me so that I can call her a friend again(idk if it makes sense).  If I had to ask if I should be friends with her again,  that would sound.. Naive or to me,  in my pov,  foolishness.  Cause I ended it for my good,  and if she was not being nice to me,  why is she now?  So I'm wondering if it isn't wrong to like take time and see or let me say observe.  Because I don't "trust" the idea that she's being nice to me again.  Or maybe because her friend was talking or getting closer to me...?  I would really like a feedback or advices.  Thank you so much to those who read and gave their opinions (no hate plsssss).
Stop doing wen you don't tack when you move your mouth please
a door ca give you a black eye by the way just saying i was next door
Bro the door situation makes no sense 🤨
I think when you’re in a domestic violence situation you tent to make excuses for the person. He definitely hit her and she was covering it up. She probably would lie to herself about it as well. Cycle of abuse.
Bruh the counter is actually fire I’ve been eating there for forever and it slaps
My man got a HOLE FEDORA
No she freaking is lying because I just tested it out and no it came and hit your eye because you're like eyebrow part of your head is blocking it from even hitting your eye
14:06 That....okay that advice hit me hard and made me realize some shit. I think I really needed that. Thanks sWooZie
I got hit with a door and it did not give me a black eye.
7:56 this man got me taking notes over here💀
In my opinion, experience, and info in this video, she and he are both toxic. If you ain't got the whole story you can't make a proper diagnosis.
i dont get why dudes hookup/"makeout" w random females. bro ur gonna catch herpes and that shit never goes away.
SWOOZIE,. .. mah man Lol Really? "I don't see how a door can give someone a black eye."you casually state. Well let me break it down see if this makes sense for you.😁STEP 1} Go stand in the bathroom. STEP 2) Get within a few inches of door like you would locking it or if you would be peeking out the crack of an open door. STEP 4) Have some kick said door with it still not closed and your head within a few inches away from the corner of the door. Hope that helps Champ! 😆👍 Love your Content. Keep being you!
Yes a door can give you a black eye
A Dora can give somebody a black eye or possibly a scar
UwU
Swooz she was probably capable of moving out to a place and just needed support and a friend to get back on her feet with. If she gets clingy you can always make things clear for her rather than making her handle this on her own in her own place. She clearly wanted your help and considering she kept coming to you for help and advice and your opinion she clearly valued you.

7:46 That’s smart I liked the way he explained that
I hate how sometimes the other person wont allow you to hangout with your friends
A door would injure her cheek and a black eye is almost impossible to get so he 100 percent hit her
maby the door knob hit her in the eye?
Wouldnt the door just hit her cheek bone??
You explaining things like my maths teacher. I SEE EVERYTHING NOW!!!  thanks bro, you’re awesome 😎😎
also your questioning of her lying about her black eye is just RED FLAG RED FLAG RED FLAG. how is that even remotely suspicious to you, the door hits you on the side of your face of course you get a black eye. i dunno who this dude is but he hates women, I only watched him talk for 15 minutes and i can tell
Whoa whoa whoa, can we talk about how YTA for not dating this girl because she was TOO into you? I wonder why that girl can't find a nice guy...
U 2 got drunk together, she could just get clingy and social when she is drunk, me personally, I collapse 9/10 times
I’m his shoes I’d put a ring on her as soon as she starts getting clingy
8:53 yes, yes you can get a black eye from that
The only thing I can think of is like the doorknob hit her eye but I don't think she's that short unless she was crouched down what's her height cuz if she's taller than a doorknob then was she crouched down when this specific thing happened cuz if neither of those things he had to have hit her that's messed up I hope she gets the hell out of that
You're kinda indirectly insulting all women who are interested in you, since you said no one is THAT attractive who messages you. Lol
sWooZie: ~wow
A door gave me a black eye once
The door would hit the eye and a streak down and your nose
so where's the girl ig then? im curious about her lol
Hey Swoozie. You can get a black eye from a door. It's happened to me. It seems impossible until it happens then you're like. Hubu? Hubu Hubububu. HUBUBUBU!!!! You literally don't know how to react so you start speaking jibberish.
I love the bottle analogy 👍🏼
lol i hope Ann and Swoozie wind up together
After research, a door is able to be at an angle to slam into your general eye area and give you a black eye
"Know your Value, and add tax." -Swoozie
Who else found her IG ????? 👀
Swoozie I got a black eye  from a cupboard
*"Know your value... and add tax"*  Swoozy 2021
He going to jail
You just saved me, bro  Thank you!!!
Doors can give you black eyes by hitting you in the temple. My sister slammed the door as I was running and I smacked into the door, BOOM black eye.
abt the bruise thing, it depends on the severity and the spot of where it is, if it's more focused on the bone than where the eye socket is, more likely the door if it's more focused around eye than the bone then it's a punch
A door gave me a bloody nose...
maybie its the knob ive hit my face in those one to many times
I had that happened to one of my good friends. She is in a toxic relationship for a long time. Me and other of her friends have been telling her advice on what to do, but doesn’t take it. She knows that her bf is bad news, but she doesn’t leave him. She thinks that he will change and all. I’ve been telling her this for over 3 years and the situation is getting worse … so I’ve decided to cut ties with her. I’ve been friends with her since middle school and it pains to leave like this but she needs to know that this relationship is getting way out of hand. Plus I’m not the only that has cut ties with her. I told her that if her bf is worth losing all of your friends. I told her once she is ready to move on from her bf and breaks up with him, that I will come into her life again because I know she will need the support to move on.
13:46  Once or thrice
dang
Let's be friends
I've also had friends that kind of act like this, they call and cry about how their partner have been horrible and how they've broken up, but the next day they're back together again. I've learned that it doesn't matter what you say or do. If people don't want to get help you can't help them. I choose to live in a happy and sane relationship, if they want to continue with their toxic one then that's their choice.
swoozie the corner of the door
door knob
Does she do tiktok nd was she in the navy
A door can definitely give you a black eye. had it happen.
If I was you sizzie I call them the third wheel and a info spy
I think the doorknob smashed into her. Or the side of the door hit her face as it swung open.
Ngl I would have done the exact opposite of what Swoozie did, like if she ask to stay with me without hesitation I’d say yes, don’t even have to tell me your gonna cook for me
Dude I love this man great message
You know what swoozie Ima ring that bell
I've given myself a black eye with a door.. regardless, any fight that leads to chasing, time to dip
PLEASE DID NO ONE REALIZE HE FORGOT TO PUT THE GAMES HE WAS TALKING ABT IN THE SCREEN-
Epic
Love ur videos bro   But why you callin girls “Females” 😀
Thank you so much! I don’t have a gf or a Bc , but I do have a friend who’s kinda like this
I quickly googled if a door can give black eye and yes you actually can get an black eye from an door.
It’s me or your family I got that question before I was like family duh
A door can give a black eye if it injures the orbital bones enough
Doors cant give black eyes but scars😔😔
They got married..  Me: THE FUDGE 😱
Just googled it apparently a door🚪can give you a black eye
The bottleneck analogy actually makes a lot of sense to me. You’re a great storyteller!
A door knob can give you a black eye as far as I know
It can if your scared close it and you start getting on your knee to calm yourself and he kicks it in the door knob can hit you in the face or the edge
6:20 😔 Never got to try Club Penguin, but damn that game looked fun.
dudes and females... lol
Why all my relationships have been toxic?
Man I'm sad from this story. I think the girl and the guy are probably both not happy in this relationship and are probably both toxic in their own ways to eachother.
Idk, in my opinion of a guy or girl puts a serious bruise, wound, or emetinol damage, you need it fucking leave them, if it’s not on purpose, but harm was still intentnol, as he said ‘deuces’
“If you break up with me I’ll kill myself” lmao heard that a few times
The irony here is my toxic ex is a huge fan of yours. //maniacal cackle
Great advice
I had a black eye because door hit me
The part where he is forced to wife the girl up is probably the funniest part of a hilarious video.
lmao
The “Wow”s are so funny 🤣🤣
I'm so curious as to who it is x(
I understand! Even in social situations, this can happen. We need to identify the root causes of why the individual may be exhibiting these behaviors. They could have been harmed in the past, may have borderline personality etc. The more you know about the situation, the more that you can identify what to do in a given situation. Also one of my own friends behaves this way as well. Every time she fights with her mom she runs away and will stay with the guys she dates until they fight and break up. It has ended badly for my friend multiple times. My friend and I have a strategy now where she can call me if she ever wants to run away. I dont always allow he to stay over but i let her hash her emotions out with me until she is able to rationalize her thoughts.
maybe she got hit by the doorknob
no one:  swoozie: *whispers* waaaaaoooooh
ya know what I hate in a guy/girl is when they look for your baggage ignoring their own
Girl run! Sprint away!
you look like Ne-Yo mate 😁😁
Tell me why I literally went to my bedroom door and tried to reenact that situation 😂😂😂
Do you have a podcast?  I’d listen to it faithfully
It can give you a black eye but you need to be in specific spot/angle
One time I was trying to open the door in the middle of the night I was on my knees puking so I when to the door look up and then my mom cam in and the door gave me a black I because it was a push in to the room deal
My grandma told my dad he had to choose between his wife and kids or her. He broke up with his mother so fast! 😅 And yes she is THAT weird I've seen it.
Your “portion control” explanation >>>
nice hat
I had a toxic relationship but he didn’t really care what I did I just had really bad trust issues with him and he made excuses not to call me or hang out with me and when we broke up he told people he never cared about me or loved me it was like a month ago I’m still upset about it to
I needed that comment about portioning love.
And also one toxic thing is when a partner says they will kill themselves if they break up.
I've delt with clingy I'm not into that much like if it's no you have to hang out with me all the time and stuff like that I'm out I've always had that what I want in a relationship is someone who let's me hang out with my friends same friend group even better
i know a person in a toxic relationship this video would be great for them
not a npc
bro i hate it now a days its toxic girls in relationships
RAPTURE
sWoozie what happend  to the 5 day rule
A door gave me a black eye yesterday
🔥🔥🔥
My toxic ex was super egotistical (he wasn't a terrible person just a bad partner). Anyway both of us at the time were planning to leave for a program in another country and when we started dating we began making plans on possibly even living together (we'd only been together for 3 months, i know it was really stupid but i was 19 and this was my first serious relationship). Anyway the one day we were on a date and we talked about going into the army together and he turns to me and goes   "Yeah you know the army can get really stressful and things happen and I dont know if I can stay faithful to you" .....I broke up with him about a week later.  There were other things that prompted the breakup but that was the moment that the rose-colored glasses shattered for me.
ive gotten a black eye from a door, sucked hella bad
Doors can give you Black eye
Loving the clean fit my dude OOooooo WEEEeeee!
you be getting the short stick wit girls I feel you
Mate adopt me and teach me all you learned
The door would definitely hit your forehead first 😂
I think a door can but only the doorknob part
I have been in a very bad toxic relationship it was horrible
It can give you a black if the door is well kicked open in the story but you head has to be at a angle
I’m saying you said 6 wows 😦 😂😂
A door can give you a black eye actually
as a person that's been hit in the face by a door yes they can hit you in the eye but it would have to be really hard for you to get a black eye from it
Man I love you giving just life advice, thank you
Doors CAN give someone a black eye I’m pretty sure-
why is he my new psycologist?
tax the shit out of them like "free healthcare".
Man wearing a hat from tf2
My friend was in a toxic relationship. Me being the more silent one, I let her vent to me. It made me really mad hearing what her ex was doing, to the point where she has really bad anxiety. Currently she's doing better, but since I'm not in any other classes with her, I can only text/call her. (I'm more of an in person talker)
I like ur hat
I just need someone to play Battlefront 2 Co-op with, it’s split-screen only so I can’t do an Xbox party unless it’s an online battle mode.
doornob
Ngl... I am that toxic element of the relationship and so long as I have to accept other's fault, then my own flaws are other people's problems.  I'd rather be toxic than impotent (simp).
Swoozie has gotten so much better than i remember
You can get a black eye from a door. That happened to me.
I love how I accidentally clicked play on my music and it’s toxic by Britney spears
8:50 ; it was problably the corner of the door.
If your parents are toxic it's a lot harder to leave
😃
when some girls say there face gets hit by a door as an excuse
What you're talking about is basically why I had to end a two year relationship with my ex. It wasn't maybe quite to the same extreme.   I knew he was quite a bit more into me from the get go (I'm a geek, a bit of a gamer, I always try to really show my love and warmth for everyone and make other people's days just a bit better and according to everyone but myself most days quite pretty). Of course, I was very into him and I still love him. (We broke up last week, I'm not over it yet.) I'm demisexual so it took me a bit longer to be in the same place as him and he was still always a bit more into me than I was into him but not like I wasn't into him, like he was just really into me.   I broke up with him last week after two years because I eventually realized how codependent of me he was. It was unhealthy. I won't go into details but he also indirectly made me very aware of how codependent he was of me. I started to feel very put on a pedestal and feel guilty if I wasn't around to make him happy. He didn't try to make me feel that way but it was still happening. It just was a lot of pressure and responsibility. A once very healthy relationship became stressful and it wasn't going to be fixed overnight.   We were both at different points in our mental health. I'd been through therapy before and worked on myself and was in a better place and was more self aware. I still had issues that were starting to come back up again but I had been through it and knew how to handle myself. He'd only just started to really put in the work with therapy after I'd had to try and keep nudging him a lot to get there. It just was still not working and it was going to take to long for us to both be in a place where this relationship could work and be healthy. So I had to break up with him last week. Because he's amazing he took it really well and was very understanding.   Now, I'm just a mess. It's a relief in a way, I don't have so much weight on my shoulders but it still hurts. It was unhealthy but I still love him but I had to do what was best for both of us.
Is this a new video because it was posted at January 15 and it sounds like I heard it before. Oh wait this is 2022 not 2021 my bad.
*clicks* That's not Ne-Yo 😩
Well by getting hit by a door you won't get you a black eye unless someone hit you in the face but you will get big ass bruise
At the beginning I though she was going to be the toxic one
The door knob might It would be unlikely unless she was short, or trying to use body weight to close the door
I mean you can get a black eye but actually get a black eye socket like just the bone and skin around getting bruised a door can definatly do that
Wait. Can someone answer the door question 😂
do you like cheese
I looked it up turns out you can get a black eye from a door
*girl/gal, not females 🥲
Doors can give you a black eye
A door can definitely give you a black eye
what happened to your finger
i had a friend that called me around 3am, saying that she was locked in the bathroom cuz her boyfriend was chasing her around with a knife, we were all in high school, me, her and her boyfriend, so they didnt live together, so i asked where she was and she said that she was in her house, i called the police and sent them to her house, and after that her boyfriend was sent off with a warning, a warning for trying to kill someone, and she stayed with him, she was like "he was loyal to me so i have to be loyal in return" im like bro, he legit tried to kill you" and later that day, i got a call from her, so i answered and it was from this twat that tried to kill her, and he was like "why you talkin to my girl? dont talk to her, shes mine, not yours, you dont wanna see me angry" im like bro, we hung out together, i could easily pick you up and throw you, you aint big and bad unless you have a weapon. hes like 5 houses down from her house, and im like right across the street i can just go across the street and be in her backyard, so id be hanging out with her once in a while. one time i went over to her house to play a game or smth, idk it was something on the switch that was split screen, and her boyfriend was over there, so im like "yea why not ill go see if this fella lost his hinges" and i got there before he did cuz she gave a time of 6pm and im usually on time, so i got there before her bf did, sense im closer and hate being late. so i came threw the backdoor sense it was connected to the living room where the switch was setup and was closer then walking all the way around the house and knock on the door. and her bf got there about 15 minutes late, didnt knock, didnt make his presence known, straight up walked in like he lives there which i found kinda weird. but we started playing and we were all sitting on the floor with me facing the window, next to her, and then her boyfriend on the other side. and she got up to go to the bathroom or smth, idk, the game was paused she walked off and it was just me and this fella sitting there, i stood up to stretch and he also stood up and pushed me, i said nothing to him prior, so i looked at him and was like "dude wtf" he said in a very aggressive tone "DONT LOOK AT MY GIRL" im responded back with "ok? im sorry but shes my friend, i known her for many years, and never wanted anything more then just friends" he legit tried to act big and bad and was like "i seen how you looked at her, i seen how you talk to her" i was quite confused sense he showed up 5 minutes before we started playing, so there was maybe 15 minutes in between the time he showed up and when she got up. so by this point he was straight up yelling about me talking to a friend, she came out kinda confused and scared, and he seen her, ran over to her screaming "GIVE ME YOUR PHONE, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TALK TO HIM ANYMORE" she went with it, and then he just left, and after she got calmed down i left as well, and then the next day she came to my door and was like "we got into a argument last night and he said i wasnt loyal enough, he yelled at me, and threatened me" i just responded back with "be loyal to what is true for you, if you dont wanna be with him, tell him that, mute him, block him, tell your parents what happened, hell even the police what happened" turned out that her bf was sent to a correction school for kids that are mentally unstable
あなたならお迎えくださいよねなお誕生日 I have no idea what I just said
if the door hit her forhead or nose it could give her a black eye i don't know why but if something hits you nose you can get a black eye just how the body works
door knob
Toxic GF: its either me or your family  Me: *Initiating Full Vin Diesel mode on this bit#$*
Door handle
Yeah, a door can give you a black eye. Especially if you have ‘thin skin’. I’ve worked with a lot of elderly people who would run into doors, fall in the floor, and boom massive black eyes and bruises along their faces.
The door knob? It looked like she was kneeling down
You can have a black eye from a door
this man has taught me so much
this man swoozie look like an upgraded NEYO
Dang swoozie I just started watching your vids a d I dont comment on vids usually but maaan. I have a story that terrifyingly similar to this. Whew *chills*
A door can give a human being a black eye because of pressure
This is azzyland fs
*swoozie says i've been in a toxic relationship once or thrice
6:56  you kmow how magical a toxic relationship starts  Its like it starts so good and then u get sucked in and later u notice these odd things or toxic marks that u kinda like brush off ur like "nah its ok that was just one time" thats hoe that starts
13:44 TWICE nah THRIS
I love your stories….💜
Yo let's go kidnap some puppies
I really can't ignore the very brief Britney Spears music clip when he said the word toxic
I've heard what you describe as 'Tipsy Mario Kart' called 'Don't Drink and Drive'.
Nah man. That door was not a door. It was prob a fist
door nob + eye = black eye
Tysm for the relationship advice I rlly needed it
A black eye can happen when something strikes a person on the face. This could be a ball, a fist, a door,
The door thing would work if her eye was level with the doorknob somehow
Swoozie you play COD?
The holy grail of relationship information
No ones gonna talk about the overwhelming generosity that swoozie did and tried to provide for her and She turned it down!!!! Whaaatttt
So what's your xbox lmao
What i've learned is that too much of a good thing is toxic. Sometimes even if its not inherently evil, it can still hurt the one you love.  But no dude in this story sucked ass.
Go to a therapist❌  Watch swoozie✅
LISTEN ,LISTEN  i love your videos but you're sus swoozi was a girl i would get with you just because of your speech pattern
Yes a door can give you a black eye
Door can give you a black eye cuz I had a friend that got a black eye and she was telling the truth because the next day she had a black eye
let's talk about toxic hats. Bruh
guys i really thought his boot was his foot and i was genuinely concerned so i spent a good while playing back the first couple seconds until i realized 😭😭
YESSSSS
Ann, please. You gotta get out of there girl. You're better than thisssss :(
It's the wow for me
I think the word you’re looking for is ABUSIVE not toxic
Goddamn
He hit her ain’t no way
One of the best videos ever! The advice at the end, that's just super on point!
I just got out of a 2 year toxic relationship and it’s the best thing I’ve done. Stupid on my part to have stayed so long in one but love is blinding sometimes
She don’t wanna be saved.
I spent the entire story expecting you to tell me she was lying about him the whole time & that she was the toxic one.
8:53 mmm, maybe if it was the corner of the door, it could maybe hit your eye…? But either way that guy is an asshole.
You can get a black eye from a door I got one when I was 7 playing tag in a camper when I turn around bc I see the tagger and my freind in front of me slams the door and it hits me in the eye and so yeah that’s how that happened
Sharp Hat Bro
accountability person? i think you mean accountabilibuddy.
“Know your value and add tax” is probably the single most greatest quote ever
Bruh este sombrero
The door would have hit her arm, not her face. Also, The door would have hit her cheek bone and bruised her.
30days
Your story telling abilities are superb!
Not a fedora, a trillby hat. Know your hats 👏👏👏
Just so you know my previous job I had to deal with a lot of "accidental" injuries. While the situation sits seem sus it is very possible that the corner of the door struck her face. This could cause a black eye. I've seen it happen.
You could only get hit in the eye with a door if your head is sidways
I have ran into doors a ton and got a black eye from it at school
oh no a door does give you  a black eye to give you a black eye the door knob is needed
My toxic friend now has a crush on me ;-;      HELL NAH
the portion control analogy makes sense to me
she legit asked if you want to wife her up and you turned her down lmao, who else would suggest to cook for you and live together for 30days.
Wasn't the door
Know your value, and add tax--keeping that one
Nice hat
bruh 123t likes
😆yesss👏👏👏👏 preach 🙌🏼
Welcome back to fact or cap we will be testing if a door can give you a black eye
Hi
I hope the girl isn't Hafu :c
Swoozie: “so he didnt lay his hands on you🤨????“  Ann: “no, the door hit me😐”  I died 😭😭😭
I remember on Xbox prolly like 3 years ago I texted him as a fan just telling him I really like his vids stuff. He actually replied I was shocked.😲 Then my other online friend heard me simping to me tp calm down come back to reality wanted proof ao I sent him a screenshot
7:10 its hard…. I be wanting to drown them
8:48 could she have gotten hit by the door knob?
this guy is my go to therapist for free
No lie, seriously thought for a solid minute that he had a thimble on his finger for no reason. It is not such. I have no clue why I thought that....
Anne sounds like she has some attachment issues..... Hope she's ok
a door can give you a black eye
OMG the "Woowww" is freaking killing me 😂
He’s Louisiana just been a while since this video came out but I just looked it up but a door can’t give you a blackeye but if somebody kicked it it could’ve not your idea so I’m pretty sure she’d like to tell you wanna just come over there right now but she doesn’t want you to come over thereSo you can do something about it I don’t know why she won’t she must just be thirsty
Love the hat bro, I fr love it. But it gives MAD Doc. Facilier vibes
me watching this video even though I've never been in a relationship
Just like a super wise person once told me: "Appreciate, dont attach"... if you derive all your happiness and STABILITY from a relationship, you will be unhealthily paranoid and anxious and will smother the other person and yourself. Give eachother the freedom to be completely independent and have your own agency. Then, you can appreciate eachother as a part of a greater puzzle. And remember, you can still be super romantic while maintaining boundaries!
All my friends are toxic
it can give you a black eye but that is a freak accident 1 in 100 chance  and just to say it i have like 3 exGFs that litterly claim my soul no matter what happens to me after death im will have an interssting time mostlikly
13:46 once or thwisst
wow swoozie can put on any hat and it would look amazing on him
“Know your value and add tax”  you just gave me my senior quote
Relationships actually DO make you happy, I was single and sad, then i had a gf and was 100000x happier. You can't tell me otherwise
Imagine fearing for your life over a hot gamer girl. Bro youre so paranoid🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻
"Lets call this girl Ann" BRO YOU DONT HAVE TO TELL US WHAT YOULL CALL HER, JUST MAKE THE DAMN NAME UP AND MOVE ALONG🤡
I would DEFINITELY pick my gf over my family. Gfs are so worth it. Not being sarcastic.
Wow… so u had my dream scenario and u was just like “nah I’m good…”  😩
Yeah I know what you're talkin about I had to toxic girlfriend it was bad she's always mad at me because I wouldn't work the same hours as her she was at mad at me if I needed to go see my niece play basketball or be there for my family and any kind of way she wanted to keep my splitter getting in trouble with my sister all kinds of things glad I got out of that
the edge hit her eye
Im probably never gonna be happy in life does that mean I should never have a relationship 🙁?
The door can’t give you a black eye Because you got your chin and your mouth in the way what would happen if she would’ve broke her nose I’m speaking from personal experience I’ve had a lot of doors hit me in the face no way gave her a blackeye
Well a door can give you a black eye depending on how hard it hits you.
Awesome stories
Yeah totally a door can give you a black eye lol no seriously
Her: “I’ll get out of your hair in 30 days Swozie: *B A L D*
One piece man respect
Giving you all of that advantage......no she won’t leave. It’s lovely sha
Why she be telling you though
he punced her and i know cuse my sis got a black eye from a hulaup it has to be he punced her i know now so yes she got  hit
A door can give you a black eye. But like the corner of the doors side part if that makes sense. I know because I was being an idiot forgot to open the door properly (I missed the handle and it was slightly open already) and walked right into it and got a nasty black eye
I thought that she was the toxic one and not the guy she married when swooz brought up the clinginess
If she was crouching the nob could have hit her
The "woooooow" really adds so much.
My face in this vid     😐 ….wowwww
My brother was 1 inch away from getting plastic surgery because Someone accidentally kicked a door into his eye but he is fine now and they are still friends
Bro swoozie if she letting you smash during those 30 days. Do it bro but she out after that. My two cents.
Uhhhh doors can’t give you black eyes. My sister once held me to the door and slammed it on me, and I didn’t get too hurt. NOT SAYING that he touched her, but it’s just a little… suspicious
OKAY 👏👏 ..... 👏DOORS👏CANT👏GIVE 👏YOU👏BLACKEYES👏okay,when i was 12 (I'm 15 now) (IM GONNA FINISH THIS SOON)
People who have dated tsunderes: hold my beer
"I'm hoping that toxicness stoped"  I am sorry because it most surely didn't, I am so sorry for her, because I am sure that by the time she is aware of what is happening it will be too late.  By the way, it is good when good people that are clingy do it with another good person, because if circumstances are right they will teach them that they don't need to be like that.
This sounds like a true 11 for the most part
dang when u meet a girl thats so fine and plays games but then you realize she dont like the same things as you... it hurts the soul
"Know your value... and add tax."  Love it. Can I get this on a tshirt? Or like, a coffee mug?
If a girl breaks up with me she will definitely find someone better than me 🤣🤣
This story sounds so familiar but i can't put my finger on it
I found the girl dw. I won't tell nobody. I may or may not be her friend.😂
So uhhhhh my friend once got a black from a door.And I was the reason the door hit her.
Doorknob if it was the door hit her
LOL shes crazy
Facts
So basically her eye was probably at the end of the door when she tried to close it and when he kicked open the door her eye was at the end of the door and it hit her in the eye and gave her a black eye
my fav youtuber only has 3 mil subs yet this mans got 7 mil oof
Comparing chess to life that is actually good advice
With the door giving her a black eye, the door knob could have hit her
Maybe it was the door knob
♪if you're single and you know is clap you're hands♪♪  ^-^
I mean you have a point. 14:07
The best reason I can think of for why she didn't take your offer is that she doesn't want to be alone. People with great personalities like you explained that she had tend to also struggle mentally and it may be the reason why she stayed and didn't want to move to a place without someone. Besides that, not knowing an area can also cause more stress if you don't have a roommate. I totally get why you didn't want her to come in, but I think that she might have needed more support than financially. Just me though because I struggle with abandonment PTSD, so there are some things I can't handle well on my own.
No it a AI testing you
Tbh, all friends with benefits relationships are toxic,  at least in the sense of ‚This is super pathetic, duh’.
"Know your value, and add tax". One of the best pieces of advice ever.
I told my ex if she broke up with me she’ll definitely find someone better then me is hat bad
I've don't the door black eye before
The bottle analogy is great
Burn 😏
I wonder where she is now
I literally spend 2 1/2 months playing marriage counselor when my big sisters husband moved in. They thought them marrying would solve their relationship problems and help him get a visa. The problem is both of them have mental problems and are abusive. She abused him while he was here and he does when she's in his country. Me and my parents where so happy when she kicked him out he he flew back home, but they somehow are together again and now is even a second guy in the picture. I hope they break up finally, but we don't get trough to her.
Bruh my brother gave me 2 black eyes with a you guessed it a dumbasss fucking door 🤣
Personally I love clinging af but I gotta know the Pearson well
I can vouch swoozie replied to my Xbox message
really feeling bad for her
apple
I’m late Swoozie but this just changed my perspective completely! I did not think there was a point to be made but it was a good one.
I think you should have done something some people are to nice they don’t want to hurt somebody and are scared of what they will do after they brake up
You'll never understand with this beta mentality.
Yo the whole trying to be a good friend and look out for them but also not wanting to be nosy and start something where there might not BE something, the stress
Badit being a whole updated emergency contact.
Hey swooz more stories
Wow........
A door can give you a black eye😂 I don't remember but my mom tells me a story about when I was in kindergarten I slammed a bathroom door is a girls face (probably me being retarded and opening the door fast af) but I gave a girl a black eye with a door once before by accident so it's possible
zwoozie i think she meant the door knob hit her
I’ve gotta hit in the face multiple times by a door or door “frame” as a teen and you d kid. Gotta a black eye once. Very clumsy kid. Would just walk into that bitch misjudging the clearance lol
I got a black eye from a doorknob
love the bottle analogy
I think technically if something hits you in the right spot in the upper nose it can lead to a black eye
I'm terrible horrible extremely disturbing disgusting horrible with women ...
You explain properly
No it would not
The gaming community is 50/50 in terms of gender. Women gamers are a huge part of the demographics...
Door handle
The same thing happened to me
I would guess that the corner of the door hit her face like while the door was going forward she slammed her face into the door or maybe she was lying? 8:57
Only the corner of a door can hit u in the eye
Jesus died on the cross for our sins
I did not expect for her to be married 😭😭
“Wooooooowwwwwwww”  lollll 🤣🤣🤣
You can definitely Get a black eye from a door and it hurts A LOT
You explained it right, I should've watched this 3 months ago.
I’ve been so caught up on YouTube drama that I forgot that swoozie gave some great advice even though I’m already married with kids it’s always good to know 😌😄
I had a black eye from getting stitches in my eyebrow after cracking my head open on a bed frame from jumping on a mattress, (I was 3) so it is possible to get a black eye from a different part of your eye being hit
You are....... sweet for that....... wow
I don't get that. If we break up, who you gonna wanna go with? Oh. XYZ? Nah. Block him after we break up.  Like what?
I wanna hear sWooZs screech his best screech to Britney's opening theme of Toxic.
“They got married” ………..I feel like life is Confusing,maybe the parents and her “husband” forced her
“Know your value…and add tax”  Yep that’s the one. Might get it tattooed.
I wanna know who this Ann is
I hope she’s doing better. I really hope for the best for her and I feel like you would be better for her to hang out with and that person from what you’ve said she has said before. I hope she doesn’t feel miserable. Also if you still somehow talk to her tell her I hope she doing alright
10:05 isnt he bald??
best advice!!!
When I was a kid I got a black eye from running directly into a completely flat wall. Definitely possible to get a black eye from having a door kicked into your face
swoozie, ily but where were you 2 years ago when ya girl neeeded thiiiiiiis????
Omg I really just throught all that  last month lol
Dude, you were texting for FOUR YEARS. And then she shows up like that, and drama shots your ass to get you horny. In her mind you were already dating for 2 years, (E-dating math).
sooo i googled it and yes a door can give u a black eye
The corner of the door can give black eyes dont ask how I know 😂
I can't shake the feeling that Adande should have done more. He seems to constantly let good woman out of his life.   I'm just over here for years,  really hoping you find your match someday.
2:05 real sus edit right there. acting like cutting out reg dialogue but couldve easily been like "say we met on xbox ill give u $50"
Lol this girl sounds like a problem… Maybe didn’t grow up yet.
I mean- she could’ve gotten slammed with the corner of the door-
If you up to get your boys to find her club penguin things are serious
SAVE HER NOW
Yes, a door can actually give you a black eye. (Just googled it)
AND ADD TAX
14:20 yasss amazing wise advice
A door can't give a black eye because there's little holes to put yur eyes in
While trauma from being struck with an object or walking into a door can easily cause a black eye to appear, and can even cause blood vessels to burst inside the eyeball for a disturbingly red-eyed appearance, there are other very benign causes as well, such as surgery to the eyes or nose, sinusitis, and even certain kinds of dental work!
8:50 - 9:00 maybe the doorknob if she’s short enough
I really like how the first part of this whole video was just hyping her up. It doesn’t matter how much you’re worth, a toxic person will be toxic to you.
There is a lot of "wow"
Giving me Ne-Yo vibes
“Relationships should only add happiness, not be the source of your happiness” That hit deep
You should've just wifed her
That's why I am single...
a door can
no see this is why I’m 29 and never been in a relationship. these stories right here! if ❤️or 🍆 makes you lose your mind like this?! where you STAY in a relationship that is not bringing you happiness then i will HAPPILY stay single for the rest of my life.
i know someone that's in a toxic relationship but wont do anything about it because her bf uses her for s3ggs. its annoying and im always at her house and he thinks she cheating on him with me and she wants me to stay with her all the time because she doesnt like seggs.
I'm pretty sure she got hit with the corner of the door
2 months free and she declines? Damn.
Going through the BIGGEST break up of my life. Feel absolutely worthless and remotely suicidal, but Can always count on swoozie to make me feel just a little bit better.
Probably you could get a black eye from a door if you get hit by the edge of it. This of course doesn't make the act any better. I mean, just the fact that she felt the need to lock herself in the bathroom is super bad + the fact that the guy forcefully opened it tho chase her.
sWooZie has a big heart
know ur value... and add tax  i'm sorry waht-
WHERE WAS THIS VIDEO YEARS AGO I REALLY NEEDED THEM WORDS BEFORE
“Know your value… and add tax.” That’s maybe the most useful advice on relationships ever, it just feels right
the hat must go.. U-U
It is possible. I got hit in the face by my mom with a door
bro it shoulda been you
"60 year dude named B.O.B" lmao 🤣 😂
I legit had a black eye from a door before  sooo yeah it is possible to get a black eye from a dooe
Anyone knows who’s the real person , LOL!
Is club penguin still around?
you can get a black eye for a door btw and love your vids bro
*wooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwww*
bro racheal is selling the bag man
Here we go again welp here we go also wow guess I’ll never be happy then…….
YOOOOOO DUDE HE GOT DRIPPPPP
About the black eye part, just ask for a picture
The knob?
Anyone in a toxic relationship right now, you are stronger than your partner may make you think. If you feel like you can't leave, build up a support group and strategize a plan to help you get out. Afterwards, attend therapy sessions to help you work through the negative mindset leftover from your relationship. Not only are you helping yourself, your helping the people you love. I know it's not that easy, but you deserve better and it's out there waiting for you.
Damn I want swoozie to help me out 😂
Shes a abuser tho
Bro no cap it seem like she wanted u but she didn’t wanna leave what she did get
Good talk man!  ☝️🧐
Three thosand eighty four for three thosand 5 with 6 and 9 of 3 i have no idea what i am saying
I fell on the floor and got a black eye once so surely a door can do the same
as someone who has been in a toxic relationship- (he would do the “narcissistic flips” on me, lie STRAIGHT to my face, lie ON my name about having sex with me even though we’ve NEVER done it, gaslight me, etc) it hurts me hearing this story... like obviously we don’t know what truly went down with that girl and her now-husband, but hearing this perspective, it’s pretty devastating.
it could be a door stopper
My theory on how Anne got a black eye, Maybe the doorknob hit her in the eye
This video was more than a notion. My grandfather used to say that birds of a feather flock together. Ann was her own kind of toxic. That whole perpetual damsel in distress BS is as toxic as the abusive bully type. Girlfriend needed to woman the eff up!
Ngl if the door hits you next to the temple by your eyebrow then you can definitely get a black eye
A door did give me a red eye because my brother pushed it when we were kids but not a black eye but then again we were tiny kids I can only imagine what would happen if a grown man did it
ok answer for your question a black eye is a brusie witch is a popped blood vessil and when something hits your eyebrow like a door it pops the blood vessil around the eye witch makes it a black eye. your welcome
sgfdgs
Swoozie the door knob probably hit her in the eye
Swoozie, you were a bad friend in this situation. She was nothing but good to you and you let such a nice person end up with someone who treats them horribly. Honestly, if we were friends I'd unfriend you over this. I wouldn't see you as someone who had my back.
The way this girls situation got worse and worse and then they broke up and I’m like FINALLY and then she does a 180
Thrice, thats a new one Haha, just joking!
"SNIP SNIP, DONE." period. Been the person stuck in the toxic relationship; I've lived with them because their PARENTS couldn't come get them... grown ass "adult" (24yrs at the time) who said they didn't want to break up because they had promised my late grandmother (who had just passed and only known them for less than a month) that they would "take care of me", and ALSO because I was the "best girlfriend they'd ever had." I was with them for two years, lived together for the last year before dropping them off at their parent's house in another state because they wouldn't leave.   In Swoozie's words... Wow....
Bro ukinda stupid fr is now u got money but u do NOT KNOW HER wtf. Why would u pay for her apt, love urself man fr.
If the door hits you perfectly then yes but if you standing so the thing in front of you then no the door break ur nose so maybe door or ur punched her in the face
13:46 once or thrice
A door absolutely _can_ give you a black eye, it just depends on how it hits you. When I was in high school, I went to open the door to the gym and some guy rushed out and slammed the rim of the door into my right eye. Bruised my eye and most of my cheek for weeks. It was an accident, mind you, and the guy felt really bad, lol. Not saying she was telling the truth, just saying it is indeed possible.
Creepy thing about "You'll never find anyone better" lines is that if you say something ENOUGH people will just start to believe it. We pick up on things like that even if we initially don't believe it. Repetition can actually embed stuff into your brain, even if you KNOW better, it can plant doubt.  Look at entertainers or News types who WANT people mad. They will say some sleezy stuff but people will start to follow those words more and more the more they hear it.   That's gaslighting and abusive and it's never okay. People may do it in relationships, but in the real world hearing stuff like "gay ppl are bad and going to hell" isn't just words when you hear over and over all the time!  This is why slogans can be really insidious. It's almost a mild form of brainwashing in some ways when done with intention.
She was cheating too.
Nice you got that club penguin.
Sounds like a you dodged a simp trap. Checkmate
I know all the comments are about doors but let's talk about the toxicity of spouses NOT ordering fries and then trying to eat yours.
8:59 since a door handle is extended outwards and is able to hit the eye, either she got hit in the eye by her bf or the door handle slammed into her eye
the best line in the ENTIRE vid is "know your value...and add tax"
A door can give a black eye
nob?
Yeah it was probably the door I got hit by a door once and I got a blackeye
ssssWWWWWWoooooooooozzzzzzzziiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
gg
The amount of dislikes (right now) are 911
Some people are sayin this in the replies, but I could only find one comment about it so Doors can cause black eyes if theyre hit in the right spot (like just below your eye)
when by the marry part i made the same reaction
Funny the dislike numbers are 911 what's you're emergency
Wowwww that’s crazy, I like the honesty. God Bless ❤️✨
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️✨🌙
Hey hey! Found a new animation channel I'm gonna binge watch :)))
LETS TALK ABOUT TOXIC INTERNET PEOPLE
Yeah some people really lack discernment or ignore it all together, the human skill meant to alert of dangerssss 😭 learned the hard way you can’t force another adult to make obvious good decisions. They end up turning on you lmao
Thought this was a video on recognizing toxic relationship. Rather you're just telling a life story with no real morale. Much better if you could just get straight to the point
hi
Yo this is amazing lol
A doorknob can
hi
I got a black eye running into a door handle when i was like 8 lmao
Yikes. Poor girl who she eventually gets outta there. It’s Stockholm syndrome. It’s why girls like Harley Quinn stay with guys like the Joker.
I would have let her stay with me. Im the kind of guy to give to my friends when they need it, even at the cost of me. And Im also very hot headed, so when I hear that a women is in danger, im ready to kick ass.
I litterally just found you today and i cannot stop watching, your litterally epic dude
Smite.... you should play smite 😆
In short words toxic relationships are like cactus juice you drink it you get addicted and forget about sharp pointy things even tho it harts and you think if you leave this juice you will not get another good juice and when you do leave it you realise how much it hurts your hands that's how toxic people okey and bye
Not you called the homie to confirm the reality is the situation.
Was def pokiemane
Girl: I got hit by the door = He punched her in the eye!
are you small or is your bed just really big
Sorry dude she had a boyfriend, you should have blocked her back.  What you did was toxic.
A man wearing a fedora,I believe him
She is no joke the perfect girl
Say yes
maybe the corner of the door hit her?
"....woow....."
Swooz, as a professional dumbass, getting hit by a door, doesn't leave a black eye but can bruise your face bad if like literally kicked.
why he remind me of Ne-yo- Deadass
2:03 Swoozie’s 1 guy friend so he can say he doesn’t only have girl friends
The tasteful swing emphatically attach because instruction immunochemically scream by a round secretary. decorous, lean relation
Yes it can
This Reminds Me Of Shikamaru From Naruto, BIG BRAIN SWOOZIE!
If you hit your eye in to a door hard enough and and at the right angle it will definitely give you a black eye
There's no way you're this fine Trina talk to little old me, dead.
If anyone demands that you cut someone out of your life, cut them out instead.   There can be legitimate reasons to SUGGEST you ditch a friend or family member, but well-intentioned people in your life will NEVER demand it.
I got a black eye from falling on a ladder's rung.
I love you swoozie
So... I quess I'm slightly toxic cause I lie but I mean it is to protect whomever I'm lying to
wearing a fedora is a great way for "nice guys" to think your one of them, now they can learn toxic relastionships and stop XD
Do u have a gf bc just curious btw I’m a boy 😅
If it was a door it is going to be a bruise that goes straight down not cup under the eye like when you get punched in the face. I've got pretty good experience with door black eyes (never thought I'd use that sentence .-.) I've taken a blow on the outside and inside of the eye by door and it doesn't look like a normal fight black eye.
"Know your value... and add tax." I love that!! :)
swoozie is like a free therapist.... I love it
Swoozie I will forever watch your videos. You give such great advice.
I don't even know how that's possible
I gave myself a black eye with a door
9:10 door handle??
yo ann is pokimane confirmed???
So we not gonna mention how he said club penguin 😂😂🐧
OMG, Thank you Swoozie. I just told my friend who has a toxic girl your advice and now they are happy together!
I've gotten a black eye by a door 😂😂
These girls make me question Swoozie's gaming skills
I met my husband playing left 4 dead 2 on xbox back in 2012...we still play every week
Simps discussting I was some simp ones
Did she catfish you
Little old you no you fine boy and she know that from looking at you
If you feel you need to run from someone when you're in an argument, _and they chase you_ , that is a sign they can't be trusted. If you're running from someone and try to physically get away from them and they *KICK* THE *DOOR* , _THAT IS A SIGN THEY CANNOT BE TRUSTED_ . Do not wait for someone to lay their hands on you! If you feel afraid, that is you reading the room! Get the fuck out!
You are literally my therapist
Technically, it's been 4 years before the first official meet up. So Is that really a good measure of clinginess?
Swoozie is the friend I never I had. Thank you so much Dear God. ☺️
biggest capper NA
A little late to this video, but man did I need to hear this... thank you bro! Keep being you
I’m confused, soooooo who was toxic? Anne or her boyfriend????  Y’all slept together, The fact that she kept communication open with you while she was in a serious relationship makes her questionable af. Even sounds like she was triangulating you and her boyfriend.
To be fair getting thwacked in the face by anything can easily lead to a black eye  Could have been the door slammed into her cheek/eye socket, swelling ensued,  Disco black eye acquired   This is from a person whose had two, one from a polearms training session gone wrong and one from a plastic toy hidden Blade......being fired directly into my face......the face is a fragile thing it goes up real easy
No wonder she's so clingy. Nobody wants her
I mean, I've gotten a black eye from the doorknob, not the side of the door tho
8:35 I bet a a lot of people will like to have a chat with the guy
This gotta be one of the most cracked like ratios I've ever seen
About the door: It's not impossible to get a black eye from getting hit by a door or by running into it. It's pretty darn hard to do, especially without busting your nose in the process, but it can happen.  In regards to the relationship issue, there are some people out there that just feel that they either A) Cannot survive on their own or B) Cannot be without a relationship. Heck, there are people out there that feel it's better to be miserable and in a relationship than to risk being alone at the end of their life. These also tend to be the people who hop from one relationship to another the second one ends to avoid that possible loneliness because they tend to (not always) base their self-worth on if there is someone who wants them. These are also people that are easily preyed on as a result.  I feel sorry for your friend because she does sound like a lovely person. But you also made the right call in not letting her stay with you and making the offer you did. That was a red flag in and of itself that was attempting to hop again. But you're right. She's an adult. She will have to come to her own realizations about herself and what she needs in her life.
a door can and did give me a black eye
a friend of mine got a black eye from a lamp post
Actually @sWooZie we account for 45% of the gaming community its just most of us are too scared to out ourselves in fear of boys being rude or weird.
With the right angle a door can give you a black eye so yeah
YOO I NEED YO KILL A MAN???
Tbhhhhh idk “Anne” personally but this actually sounds similar to my friends friend who when you meet her she does come across as this big heart innocent quiet person when in reality was narcissistic and acted like she was the victim to get attention and sympathy, ended up being the cheater and the emotional abuser leading him on for years under the assumption that they were getting married so unless you’re actually with the people and witness the abuse u really can’t be to sure who’s telling the truth, cuz alot of girls (guys too but this is especially true for girls) are wolves in sheep’s clothing
A door can give you a black eye if you hit it at an angle, and I only know that because I've ran straight into one.
I got a black eye from a door
They got married . Oh god
"I wish buy you a plane ticket and pay for your 1st (2nd) month's rent for ANYWHERE you want to stay in LA."  I legit thought she was going to go for the most expensive apartment but........the fact she declined made me legit scream "THE FUCK?!"
I like your analogy of portion control, in only that a slow, methodical pour will allow you to learn so much more than chugging the bottle. The conversation, the bonding, should happen like a fine pour and not be spilled all at once.
I really need to see who this girl is
I dunno about a black eye but a door has given me a blue thumb before.
14:12 too true
The fallback on the bed after he heard she got married 🤣🤣💀. . . I felt that
The reason she declined your offer is that girl does not feel safe living alone ANYWHERE, but she thought she could BF you, or find another BF in the time that she was with you. A woman's clinginess is deeply rooted in her desire for security, and yes, she will feel safer with an attentive guy that "punishes" her for undesirable behaviors and "rewards" her for good behaviors than a low-interest guy who just wants to put her up somewhere all alone as a charitable act. Your behavior here makes her feel undesired, his behavior made her feel desired, simple as that. She picked him because she realized she couldn't catch you. She probably cried about it too. Women don't buy guys things unless they are trying to husband them. Those one-night stands women have, those two week flings, they aren't getting gifts EVER. Also, a husband should expect a wife to cling to him, and not her back-burner plans, or couldn't-catch list. The come-around guys gotta' go if a man is wifing a woman up. Also, do we know why he hit her? That argument was just about the salt and pepper shakers? or the curtains?  She moved fast with him because her BIOLOGICAL CLOCK was ticking, and he bid way-way higher than you. Women will take the bad with the good... they will settle with the second best guy if he's more obtainable because it beats being alone.
Last sentence was a bomb. Needed to hear that.
it can I did a test
Don't save her. She don't wanna be saved- 3 6 Mafia
Dunno, i get bored and depressed as single but found that i'm more willing to get better when i'm "in" a relationship. Also i tend to sleep better without tearing my mind apart sometimes and not sleeping at all..you know, the pain of the death of your loved ones that strikes back.
"Know your value. And add tax."  THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST!!!
Doors definitely can give you black eyes with the right amount of force.... don't ask
Welcome back to stupid people making stupid decisions. lmao If you're into some person that has relations back to back without some time in between, just DONT go for it. Thats a person that does not even think about the issues in their life.
I wanna see this Anne girl. Someone help me please lol
There must be something dense on the door
Bold of you to assume that I’m ever going to be in an relationship.
The sequal to the really good vid abt a toxic friend it's perfect
Next he’s going to see this video and file for divorce 🤫🤦‍♂️🤷‍♀️
u gay?
“Relationships should add to your happiness not be the reason why your happy”  That hits hard
Love that hat
He said club penguin
Man your so chill and respectful
My sister is in a toxic relationship. Everyone keeps telling her he's toxic and she knows it herself. But she just won't permanently leave. He yells at her for things out of her control. He accuses her of cheating but she never has and has never given him a reason to. He thinks just cause she's good looking that she's cheating. He forces her to go to his church. He gets upset if she doesn't call or text back within 10 mins. Even if she's with her family, her phone dies or she's driving. HE BLAMED OUR FAMILY FOR HIS MOM BEING IN BAD CONDITION IN THE HOSPITAL. He really thinks my family has given his mom the evil eye. Always accuses us of talking about him 24/7.  He's called her the devil for retweeting horror movie scenes. He made her quit her job at the tanning salon because men would flirt with her. It happens at her current job too so idk what he thinks he accomplished there. He's admitted to my parents that he sends his friends to watch my sister when she's at work. Then when my sister confronts him he lied and said he never said that. He's talked trash about her on social media. But lord forbid if she does than the world is over. He forced her to delete her male friends on her social media then delete all of the social media's she had. While he still has his and refuses to delete the provocative women on his. He says he'll kill himself if she leaves. But he's always the one to break up with her than come back. She literally cleans his house and his crazy dogs poo. He compares her to his dog. Saying things like his dog loves him more. He's angry if she's quiet on the phone. There's a lot more but I needed to get this off my chest. We've all tried talking to her but she still takes him back. I've about given up on her.
WooZie: onces or thrise....   me: Huh?? thrise????   30 mins later: Thrise?? what does that mean?? "thriseeeeee????"
ya i lost a couple of friends like this
I love how she gave the guy an alibi
Buddy forget about toxic. She just used you for attention when the bf was away at work to keep herself busy.
You can definitely can get a black eye by a door
I woulda let her live with me cuz I’m too empathic like that ☠️. But props on u for realizing she will either have gone back or clung onto you (therefore dragging u into that whole mess). Simpin ain’t pimpin no matter how fine a girl is 😤
Son I'm doing exactly what you do, payed for the place to live
adande i love you and this vid was so good literally ur like the big brother i never had who tells these amazing stories PLEASE TAKE THAT UGLY ASS FEDORA OFF
No no no, you got it wrong. Or at least how you are counting it leads to this conclusion: The woman wanted you.  The toxic relationship may be true of course, I don't know that anymore. But there were so many flags only in the story that you told that they are giving you the answer.  1- She added you from the beginning because she found you beautiful (Even being in a relationship) 2- She had no problem taking so much trouble for you (like driving hours to play a simple video game). 3- You were her right hand in the difficult moments that she was going through (whether they were true or not). 4- She wanted to move in with you for a full month, and when you offered her an even better alternative, she rejected it. There it was clearly the most notorious flag, the woman wanted to sleep with you and ... I don't know the correct term in english, but in spanish we say "engatuzarte", which means trying to make X person to fall in love with you over time. When she saw that you rejected her proposal, she rejected yours since she cannot achieve the result that she hoped for. 5- She tells you that she told her partner that she wanted someone like you in case of separation (clearly another notorious flag). 6- She said that she blocked you because her boyfriend told her (This was to make you jealous, and she expected a reaction from you in which you become offensive against she's partner). You told her that she was already an adult and that if she wanted to do that, let her do it. Again, as the answer was not the expected, she retracted and said that she was going to book you with another name (Obviously this thing about the boyfriend telling her to block you was a lie)   In conclusion, I am 99% sure that the toxic in this story was her. I even doubt that the boyfriend was how she described him. Maybe even that boyfriend didn't exist.  I had a friend who was like that, as you describe her, and believe me that that type of person you have to avoid them 100%. They only bring misfortunes to the peaceful life of another. Be careful with those kinds of people. They are manipulative people, who rely on lies or dramas to hook someone. They are not worth it even as friends.
Wow
K, your BF CHASED YOU DOWN and you try to get some space, he fucking kicks it, yet it doesn't count as abuse because it was technically the door that hit you? Fuck no. That's abuse. That's violent abuse.
I'm so done with Adande complaining that he's not that fine. Boy you fine. You're a total 10. Stfu
I'm so sorry about your friend 😭 that is really hard. I have had friends do similar things, it sucks. Good advice tho.
Swoozy ma dude. I just found your channel and you speak my soul in all your vids. This one and portion control yeah it sings
He Said I Quote:  "woooooooooow"
The girl is Pokimane.
I feel like you rejecting her clingyness, got her fucked up.
You would have to slam your head like SLAM your head into a door to five you a black eye but if the corner of the door hit her he would have to sparten kick the door
I think the term "toxic relationship" underplays what's happening here - These are literally classic signs of domestic abuse. Restricting her contacts, controlling every aspect of her life, chasing her and abusing her..? She could be seriously hurt if it escalates
"Know your value... and add tax" I'm definitely going to use that.
Its funny for it to not sound weird sWooZie says GUY friend and FEMALE friends xD respect
How old is this dude? Seems like years go by for each event.
the edge of a door ccan give you a black eye  I know from experience =(
Re upload?
Aw about toxic gay and les r- nvm, they aren’t ever toxic :D
The way he can talk about such issues like this and make it funny but not hurtful is a thing I wish more people could do
I have the same mentality on chess what and it works ?
This mans the love doctor 👨🏾‍⚕️
Wow I really really like this video Rachel
Basically summarized the relationship I just got out of.  A Very toxic GF who took advantage of me at every turn, made 0 effort to go out of her way for me (even though I would for her) and tried to blame *me* for her being mean/rude to other people.  The straw that broke the camels back: My father was hispitalized (and as of this comment still is) and we believed he was going to die....she invited me over saying she'll call off work the next day.  I told her no, you come HERE I really don't feel like driving the 30min right now but you can come here and still call off.  Apparently that was too much to ask:  for her to come spend time with me while I was a wreck due to a possibly (and still possibly) dying parent.  And with that I was done with her.
Hey swooz has anyone told you ,you are a very good artist
The counter been there good as heck
You're so right
I almost got a black eye from a door i just got a massive bruise on my forehead
Not gonna lie, when i heard him telling the Ann story i was so happy for him and then i remembered what the video title is... yikes.
sWooZie:WAAOOW
Lookin’ fresh this video
Hey I just found your content today, and I'm really enjoying it, but I wanted to say I'm sorry about your friend. I don't know her backstory but she sounds a lot like me (NB) and my sister. Our parents abused us through words, unreasonable punishments, and constant attacks on our esteem/worth. I've tolerated awful things from my wife that I shouldn't have because of it, and my sister has bounced through a series of abusive boyfriends. My wife and I are working to fix our relationship, and my sister is seeking help, but I wanted you to know because it felt wrong to not point it out. Its a really crummy pattern and people with big hearts get chewed up by it the worst.  Sorry for gloomy comment and maybe TMI. You seem cool, thanks for trying to look out for folks. I think "the kids these days" are pretty great, but I worry about them being taken advantage of so its really nice to see content like this were the young can easily find it.
I don’t know what I expected when I clicked on this but this is the most normie video I’ve ever seen in my life
The hand movements reminded me of how my dad talks. Keep up the great work
I'm swoozy when you were talking about the door thing quite often some abuses to abuse these will say oh yeah I got hit by a door or I fell down the stairs or something like that
poor girl! she clearly has soooo sooo sooo much love to give!!! Im crying and so sad for her. ;(
Bro how do you not marry this girl she seemed perfect for you
sWooZie you have so much wisdom and knowledge
When you talk about how you should treat yourself and allow others to treat you ...  They are nuggets of gold.
Doors can really damage a person for a example my dad was coming home one day (this is when we lived with my grandparents) and when he gets to the door my uncle swings it open so hard and fast it knocks him to the ground dislocating and ripping his muscle
I have indeed given myself a black eye from a door.
You OwO
yes a door can give you a black eye
yeah, I had a "friend" with whom I used to play games. Eventually, he started yelling and swearing at me when I made mistakes IN A VIDEO GAME! I told him that he was being toxic and needed to stop. He stopped for a day, and started again the other day. I told him many times but he wouldn't stop. That's when I decided, I've had enough. I blocked him and we haven't talked in a month.
Sounds like my relationship with my job.  Oof.
my brother got a black eye by a door.
friking yes, just don't leave a trail of crap nothin else + leave that mother foxer
I had a friend that was pretty toxic she would always complain when things didn’t go her way and even faked an entire depression so everyone in the friend group could feel bad, I didn’t fall for this neither did my best friend so we ended up leaving the friend group and it still pisses me off to this day
Sometimes I wish I was in a relationship, then I see these videos and get scared about toxic partners
I love your stories.
“We start making out, a lot” *Well that went from 0 to 100 really fast*
Way to find the girl: find his guy friend on insta, figure out the event he was at, find out who was there, see who fits the profile
12:04     w o w
9:42      w o w
I was NOT ready to hear they got married
Woah!
is that a czech fedora lmao i think i see the flag
the blocking thing was okay but if the guy was another guy that was good if that makes sense? Not her bf but another guy that can treat her right if he asked that then it would be reasonable
I honestly hope she's happy. Like genuinely happy. Because she clearly has low self-esteem.   She has guys simping hardcore over her and became incredibly clingy after one meeting? Low self-esteem; our inner monologue tells us we're not good enough, so we end up overcompensating and cling to whoever shows us the smallest amount of positive attention (even if it's paired with equally or worse negative attention).
Thank you for the advice now I am out a very toxic relationship
I always question why people are so upset being single acting like is the end of the world when is not even bad being single
Doors can’t give you a black eye. You don’t have to be an intellectual to know that.
That bottleneck analogy is straight up incredible
I needed to hear this 8 years ago.
I'm still confused on how the actual fuck she got a black eye from a door fam 😂
Ok     Now I’m gonna avoid toxic people
Omg portion control
my reaction during the video: wooow
Get happy first...
The door handle can give you a black eye maybe ?
Nah, she crossed a ton of lines before she learned to act right. Something tells me she never respected relationships and flirted with everyone. YOU'RE the proof.  She wanted to be a free bird while with someone that has traditional values. Sounds like she learned she's not as irreplaceable as she thought.
She might have has her head tilted back, which would probably have given the door just enough space to mess up her eye
Dude call the cops, that is Domestic Violence!!
Imagine she made the whole thing up💀💀💀
bro she cappin fr she is just tryin to slide on you
Dude that sucks so bad I had a really similar situation with a friend that I've known for years and then they drove all the way from Cali I stayed over to come and see me when she got her first car and then some dude move in with her and started tripping really hard and I haven't heard from her and three plus years🤦🤦
i was toxic once, but then something happened idk and i just quit being toxic
Bit late, but trust me when I say. If a wall can give you a black eye, a door sure can. And that is from personal experience. And a floor, they can give one too.
I've been hit in the face hard with a hard door, no it doesn't give you a black eye, it gives you a sick cut under your eyebrow that when you go back to class makes you look tough as fuck, when in reality you just turned around and slammed your head into a 3-ton door corner and would like a bandaid.
Hey swoozie we should play Xbox together dude! What games you play?
I thought this was Ne-Yo for a bit
you the man Rachel
door knob?????
Art by bandit  I have a dog named bandit comrade
Been there, She's trapped by her love.  She's the warden of the prison love built for her.  Sadly there will be days when this guy will be awesome and she'll feel the relationship is getting better, that it's finally turning around.(course that's the lie giving false hope).  When blinded by love it's almost impossible to escape that situation.  For me I wrote out unforgivable sins, that if she committed any of these sins the relationship is dead. Which of course she did, committing that unforgivable sin gave me the strength to end the relationship.  Best way to realize your in a toxic relationship is with your friends. They got your back and when they say run, you RUN!.  Anyway my advice to anyone trapped in a "Toxic Relationship" draw a line and stick to it.  You deserve better! Trust me when you embrace the next love of your life the old toxic one will be a distant memory.
I wanna see her face so badly
KNOW YOUR VALUE AND ADD TAX 😤
hits home. had a super toxic friend who went to my school who always blamed me for everything, argued with me all the time and didn't accept basic facts, was awful to my other friends and to my family, and constantly talked smack for the littlest things i did. IMO, it's not worth trying to fix toxic friends. it's better just to warn others about them so they can't hurt anyone else.
Wth
When your bro was like "oh, you didn't hear?"  Just the pause between the first and second text made me think she was killed...
If i were in ur place i would let her stay in my place i dont care if its a month sometimes people need help even if shes an adult she really seems like a truthful person i would let it if i were u but honestly u good i respect ur decision but if u did let her stay she wouldnt have gotten back into the toxic relationship
Damn bro you had her club penguin?!
i’m not sure if a door can give u a black eye but i’ve definitely been hit in the face by one a few times( don’t ask how or why)  and it mainly leaves a reddish swollen area depending on speed and angle sooooo
y’all swoozie has gotten better at story telling tbh
13:35 and on that day Swoozie died
Well said hahaha aah..
Ooh, what’s her gamer tag? Because I’m gonna troll her for some reason
I think there’s a I love Lucy episode on a door giving Lucy a black eye
Yes a door can give you a black eye. Yup I’ve seen some crazy shit!! I seen
Aye my names Rachel 😂
Corner of the door could hit your eye
I got hit by the side of a door and it gave me a huge fucking bruise on my face near my eye, but not directly there. So I mean. I don't really know?? Maybe??
Forget his relationship advice, is ur finger ok :)
I mean not defending him, but the door knob coulda hit her eye🤷
god, this is actually depressing. I hope she sees this and separates from that asshole.
I have gotten a blackeye from a door once me and my brother were playing around I slam my door like you said in the video and he full on football tackled the door and I was so surprised I held my head back a little bit just perfect for the door to hit me in the eye and that’s how I got a black eye from a door
It could've been the door handle??????
bruh imagine asking a girl to move in to your place while you still live with your parents...........
Idk man these doors kinda dangerous now I stubbed my toe on one haven’t been the same since
I know it's late but I got hit in the face giving me a black eye due to a door edge but I was on the ground.
"when you treat them like a celebrity, they treat you like a fan"
14:06 This is some great advice and definitely something I needed to hear. It seems that a lot of people, including myself at one point, think that a relationship is what they need to fix all their problems. It really is important that people find happiness with themselves, since a relationship is at most time, never going to be perfect. Treating people as an end goal, instead of using them as a crutch towards an end goal, is necessary for any good relationship to be strong and solid :)
I think Ann's been forced to get married to him.
Understand boundaries but if you didnt have "relations" with ol girl after knowing her for 4 years she was probably confused. Also she obviously has low self-esteem.
hi
Swoozie being real loud 👀
They got married!? That is some 1d chess....Turn left to go right energy
Girls like that will get you shot!
Yes sir
Abt the not letting ur partner talk to certain people, I let my bf talk to anyone. But I wanted him to distance himself from some of his friends because they made jokes abt me killing myself, and spent months trying to convince him to leave me. I said he can talk to them if they apologized to me. None of them apologized and still talk bad abt me, but he still talks to them. Am I in the wrong?? I honestly just gave up
'ain't no one this fine gonna talk to lil ol me" says that handsome man himself!! You are gorgeous don't short change yourself  Real talk though That wasn't the door What likely happened is he was listening to her or was near and she was too afraid yo say he hit her. I've been in a toxic downright abusive relationship before and what you do in those times is you give warning signs that are subtle enough so the abuser doesn't know. He wants us to hide we were dating and I attempted to just tell people we were as a warning sign cuz I felt unsafe with him.  I had a guy I dated just like this....this is kinda making me get ptsd flashbacks.   The reason you stay is dependence, fear of not being loved by anyone else, and most of all, self worth issues. He had her truly believe he's all she has and that she can't do better. I'm nearly sick from this and how closely I know how this is. I'm crying hearing this.
As a guy who have given himself a black eye with a doors. It wasn't the door.
Funny thing about the door incident, I was once fighting my cousin for several dumb reasons (we were like 12 and 8 at the time). His ass gets up and books it straight to the bathroom as quickly as possible and attempts to shut the door while peeking the corner. I burst the door open before he can shut it all the way with a kick and the corner of the door hits the side of his face (The cheek bone and eye brow area) and he begins to cry. No cut or anything but after about 30 mins his eye was black and swollen. I got punished and he learned to use doors to his advantage. As far as getting a shiner from a door, possible, it's all about those angles.
I’ve only dated one toxic girl that I met through Twitter.. like she loved horror was a pc gamer hooked me up with food and games won couple of Warzone cosplayed everything was a baddie and dude thought she was perfect literally a few months later would get mad that I wouldn’t text back in 5-10 minutes while I was working always FaceTimed me till 4am after I would come back from work like alright ok then literally would scream at me when my phone would die mid FaceTime and dude I got the worse headaches and felt sick and what finally made me leave called me with blood her actual blood covering herself told her get help and think we should just be friends and after stopped
So her bf’s family is raci$7. WTF
Bruh
You should add some background music
Pov he's giving off best relationship advice
yooo the vid was sick rachel!
If the toxic relationship still exists then she just waisted money for nothing, also hope he doesn't use a baby to trap her.
"who would you wanna date if it werent me" IS A TRAP. no person in a healthy relationship would ever feel the need to ask this question in a serious conversation.
NO NO 1000 FUCKING TIMES NO she did not
“Know your value.. and add tax.” I love it that’s my new life motto. Swoozie’s got his values figured out 100% a great role model 💖
For the flat face part: The bone below your eye if hit can cause a black eye, I have experienced it 😂 (Yes a door can hit that bone)
For the flat face part: The bone below your eye if hit can cause a black eye, I have experienced it 😂 (Yes a door can hit that bone)
I thought that this was gonna be a dream video ngl
Watching videos abt toxic relationship because I have the fear that I am being toxic to my so because they deserve nothing but the best
He got the incel hat on
Woah...that's crazy
This man is the guy i come to when im depressed or dont know what to do in a situation
I'm doing this cuz I have no potion left,I tried contacting friends and family and tell them about what's going on but they all failed,so contact first,I'm a 15 year old non-binary Egyptian and my mum is starving me cuz of being non-binary,I haven't eaten anything in a month,the only things that I'm allowed to eat/drink are water, coffee and bread,that's it,and she made me stop talking to anyone on the internet,my online friends,my cusions who lives in another country, my school friends, you name it, it's all not allowed cuz she doesn't want to "spread the shame any further" as she said,Idk what to do
Dated a toxic girl ._. It worked for 11 months and she rubbed her personality off me. Now im just ugly with a whole lotta demands and sassinness for no reason ._ is this how toxic fucks are made?
She was trying to use you as a bounce
She was making excuses to protect him. Saddly
I love your animations lol
If it’s the edge a door can hit your eye
Idk I kind of think they're both just toxic people in the end. The man is a cheater and a possible physical abuser well also "controlling". Well, the girl is overly clingy, secretive, and snoops through other people's things. I don't see either of them being in the right and neither of them should be in a relationship until they get their shit together.
I officially live by “know your value and add tax”
"Know your value and add tax" now thats something to live by
I want to meet a person ingame
I have a friend that’s toxic and I want to end are friendship and that this is helping me gain the confidence to do so
Respect appreciate the info
"know your value... AND ADD TAX"  Best advice I've heard in a while 💯
The door could have been angled in a way that hit her eye on the end of the door
sWooZie my man, do you have any advice on hot to be happy when single? Imma take your advice and search for happiness there and hopefully add more with a relationship :)
A door gave me a blackeye. I got hit with the doorknob tho. But then again, I'm a complete clumsy dude so ya know
When I was a kid I got a black eye for running into the corner of a wall
honestly my father needs to hear that last bit 😂😭
When she don't let u fuck after a YEAR
Been in and am currently in your shoes as the friend seeing this happen. Have a friend who is currently engaged to a toxic man. She says he's changed by going into the navy. I still call him a rancid t*at waffle for beating her, throwing stuff at her, making her block some people, and threatening me with his shotgun. She believes he's changed after not being with him for a month or two and gets back. It's a hard thing to watch, and an even harder thing to try and help with. You did good offering her an out, I just hope Ann is safe and you have a good one.
8:56 it can, my friend got one twice😬
my name is bob but im not 60 years old ;-;
9:00 A door can give you a black eye, especially if it hits you mad hard by the corner. My grandmother (she’s 69) got a black eye when she rushed out to get in to her car. It was horrible. >.<
“oh didn’t you hear they just got married”  Ann’s IQ points just dropped by 100
towelbar on back of door can cause blackeye
So about the door and the black eye... It all depends on how you hit the door. As a clumsy person (I can literally trip over air), I can confirm that the right angle and speed can result in your face hitting an edge or the door frame and leave a decently large bruise.
Ya I agree with him 100%. You need to state how you feel. If they don't agree then leave. Ive had to do that multiple times before
And yes swoozie a door can give you a black eye I’m mad f*cking late though
the door knob could’ve hit here
Bruh my ex boyfriend would always tell me that if I dumped him he would never date again, or he would lose his will to live, etc.  After we broke up, he dated the sister of the girl he told me he used to love sm when we were dating
Is this dude really wearing a “m’lady” hat
OMG I thought you were gonna say something worse than marry but I’m glad it wasn’t 😨 I’m also dealing with a friend like that now and Idk why they never listen :(
Damn that was pretty powerful, man. I hope everything turns out okay.
Because as a wise Mopar boy once said, “You don’t need a relationship with a random girl/boy when you got family”
How about toxic exes?
There is nothing wrong with being clingy, but you need to find someone who can appreciate you and your love. Im sad see liked a guy who wasn't right for her and then stuck to an abusive one.
Is she short or bending down. Like did the door knob hit her?
The edge of the door
if she can find ways to still text you after getting hit “by a door” and getting a black eye but can’t respond to a happy birthday message while married, the relationship mostly is still toxic and probably even worse now unfortunately.
Um sWooZie? You shouldn’t be talking about women by calling them females. It’s one of those things most douchebags do, and I don’t think you’re a douchebag sir.
When she said she moved out her house to move in with her bf parents, my head started hurting…like badly
Swoozie: how a door can give you a black eye can y’all answer that in the Comments please.  My opinion and comment for swoozie: Is how hard he kicked the door and if is a wooden door well yh it could happen well idk what kind of door they have in whatever place y’all living but I’m from the Caribbean so yh I can’t say and is how the door made.🇹🇹😅🥲
This was the most trippy video of muh lifeeee
Life in LA is pretty wild aye?
My bro ran into a door as it opened when he was 2 and now he still has a scar
I had a toxic friend he's not my friend anymore thankfully.
So if it’s not a toxic relationship but is the center of my happiness what do I do?
anyone else wondering what happened to his finger?
Bruh you knew eachother for 4 years what was “clingy right away” tf
I mean I got a black eye from a wall once, idrk maybe 🤔
swoozie you are a great friend.
But here’s a little fun thing to think about what if it’s your kink
She deserved the black eye
*club penguin*
Don't get me started on toxic relationships, I pretty much was in one thoses "it's me or your friends" spoil alert I pick my friends
Dude yes sir I agree 110%!!
Fedora
Keep playing this game and play the game forever.  She clearly likes you bro… shame… crazy decided to enter the picture
If some girl tells me to pick her or my family, I'm gonna become Dom torreto for a bit
"dudes" vs "females"? we're not dogs. seems pretty lopsided.
Why did he not take her. Dang man that's a real L. That was the dream
It needs to bottleneck.
Why was I expecting the girl to be the toxic one? Damn that really sucks
Word
Marriage?? I don’t even know her but I’m concerned, I hope she’s okay
so just thinking how moth of the bottle in the start will be ok like only 1 shoot glass or what? happy i fund my one
a door has literally given me a black eye the same way it happened to anne sooo it’s possible LMAO
You can get a black eye from a door it’s about da angle
It depends on what door and what angle you hit your face with the door
Quote of the video: " Know your value AND add tax."
You can… but only if your angled just right and you get smacked by the doorknob first. This happened to me twice as a kid.
Wow 😯
What’s up Broski 🦋🦋
You can get a black eye from a door it can happen
"if youre not happy when youre single dont get in a relationship to make you happy" ha jokes on you im both unhappy single and dating B)
Imagine getting hit by a door
8:58 actually a door removed my classmates eye a few years ago no it wants the Handle
Is this man wearing a thimble
A door can I tested it 🥲
You need a therapist SwooZie 🤦🏾‍♂️ you know how super rare she is out here today??? As Super Rare as a Yu-Gi-Oh card my g!!!!!!!!!
Ya friend ain't smart bro
That sounds all types of crazy I would have just blocked them after their first message to me on Xbox I wouldn't even have wasted my time I've had crazy people on Xbox that I thought we were friends but no they were just insane and I had to block them I also had to change my gamertag so that they couldn't find me again I don't put up with that plain and simple
In her defense.. ive gotten black eyes from stupid stuff before that I caused...
I always am worried im being toxic or abusive or whatever... I keep questioning myself and being self conscious what I say. She says im fine and arent even close to that but I am worried shes lying to keep me from worrying... Idk
So its your fault that she got into a toxic relationship
Yes!
Ngl I’ve gotten a black eye from a door
Could’ve been a circular doorknob but I think he socked her
I would've agreed to let her move in, at least that way shes away from that stinky guy
Also she could not be telling you everything, some girls like to twist the truth to look innocent I’m not saying she ain’t innocent but same time you don’t know, maybe she’s the toxic one and starting trouble but in this day an age when a man has to be perfect, sometimes one slip can make him bad but again not backing him or her, I don’t even know the full situation, maybe he actually is toxic.
I mean he’s not wrong but he did ask her but I bet he weren’t expecting her to respond or say another guys name so I get why he would want u blocked because she’s been thinking about it.
Thanks for the story and lesson Rachel, I learned a lot today!
I feel this cept I was the toxic person...And my boyfriend hung on for SO LONG...I'm finally like "Good golly...Why am I like this? Not nice..." We are now completely chill together.
Maybe it was the doorknob that gave her a black eye
I have spoken
This is good advice for the future, thanks swoozie!
The only explanations for the door giving her a black eye I could come up with were: 1. He rammed her head into the doorknob 2. She "Tripped into the doorknob" 3. She was eye level with the doorknob 4. She did it to herself 5. Fist to face But hey, maybe he had a broken door that had been curved inwards and the broken wood jabbed her in the eye...         edit: I've never had this many likes and replies one one of my comments, I know it's a small thing but the fact that so many people actually enjoyed this makes me happy.
0:59 you gotta do it for the Family.
A door can hit you hard enough to get a black eye if you stop it with your face lolol
Thanx Swoozie. I needed to hear this
Swoozie: I want to wife her Also swoozie: She was way too clingy  If every girl is "clingy" by wanting to text and hangout after a good night together, maybe you're the toxic one?
Swoozie, I love you, but referring to women as “females” is suuuuuuper misogynistic....
What is this "making out" you know i know keep it 💯
This is not toxic its blatant abuse
They got married because they felt like that would fix all the issues... smh I feel bad for the girl
Me getting hyped up thinkin this girl is the one for swoozie 👁👄👁  Me remember the video title is toxic relationship signs. 😔
Chris Paul?
The amount of FOINE girls this guy has lost is crazy
yo that bottle portion analogy was amazing, u explained it right
"if you're not happy single, you're not going to be happy in a relationship."  _That just changed my whole perspective. Im-_
"know ur value...and add tax"  swooz that was everything. Also...can u plzzzz upload "long" videos like this more often!!!?? ❤❤❤
That was the worst financial decision that girl has ever made in her whole life. I'll take that two months rent, Adande lmao I swear, I'm cute u//w//u
Wow this whole situation was a mess.  I hope she stays safe.
Bro I'm the toxic one his story of the bf reminds me of I act how do I fix this   -yes I'm already working on it any tips
Bro in all honesty the you'll never find anyone better then me thing can be taken out of context because my ex was treating me like dirt and always making me a problem and i could never talk to her without her being rude or ignorant to me and i was always calm just asking for the same love and respect i show her, i told her she cant continue to act the same way because other people if she were to ever break up with me wont deal with it and we broke up yesterday and i just realize i was fool for staying in that relationship i should of just left and not said anything period because i was hurting myself wanting for her to change and she was to immature to put someone else before herself for once, so what yall think cuz i just meant what shes asking for is unrealistic i was just saying your not gonna find someone whos perfect if you break up with me don't do it cuz you cant handle the fact that a relationship takes two people because that wont work for anyone and don't get me wrong i made mistakes but nothing that cant be solved i wasent perfect but who is relationships are about making each other better people as well as loving each other.
I have two friends in toxic relationships and one of them I don't even speak to anymore and the other one is being played with and it bothers me but I know there's nothing I can do but be there if things go south
Plot twist she’s the toxic one.
“ if you break up with me you’ll never find anybody else like me” BRO THATS THE POINT-
defo a pick me girl
John 3:16 "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life." Have a blessed day, brothers and sisters in Christ!
it seems i am part of the 1 percent of girl gamers who dont have simps on my tail damn
kanye speakin numbers bout that shirt

YASSSS
not me thinking he is calling bob who was the pretty girl
Bro it happens in a brother and sister relationship it can happen in any relationship
*pause* "Wooowwww" Had me dead every time😂 great vid mane
well now we know why a hot gamer girl was single, she is broken inside
🙏🏾✝️
Toxic lover: if you break up you will never find someone like me   Me: that’s the point
The wiseness from this video is unreal. Wow
“Know your value. And add tax.” I love this and you
One thing I love about this girl is she has a huuuge     Heart
I’d let her stay tbh wifey material
Man a door deadly af i started bleeding after the door hit under my eye
Me abt to start high school: 😗✌️
He is basically my therapist now 😂
My friend had a almost the same thing but we young
I've had someone slam open a door into my face and it didn't give me a black eye but I also wear glasses and it broke my glasses and scratched right under my eye so IDK what would happen if I didn't wear glasses
I'm not an expert on doors, but humans don't need to have flat faces to get a black eye from a door
What burger did you get? I like burgers with bacon but thats really it.
its gotta be Valkyrie
Should’ve just let her stay with you
5:30 homie down bad like sheesh whiter this girl was like the Greek goddess of  beauty like how we’re u saying to ur self oh my god
Man he's spitting out facts
My man can't get a girl I'm sorry
he is your go to dude that's what its called
At four years old I ran into the doorknob of my mom’s bf’s door and it gave me a really bad black eye. It’s possible that that’s what happen to “Ann”
Hey dude, im really sure that she was hit physically by her bf, since you said, and i quote "Humans don't have flat faces" unless she like 7 feet tall annd the corner of the door hit her, she was hit physicallynin the eye.
yes you can get a black eye by a door
Great Advice + Story I can learn from You're always great thanks for another high quality content 💯
Poo
Wowww 😅😅😂😂😂😂
sWoozie what's your Xbox
😂 i started thinking whether I want to date this girl that Im currently talking to. I can feel how mentally exhausted it can be just listening to the story. I can totally relate.
bro wtf i had to pause the video at 13:30 and walk around for a sec cuz i was so in shock
Swoozie big fan have been for a while I hope you see this but im late af. So it is possible. When i was about 8-9 i played football. My mom had told me to go out and make sure my gear was in her trunk. I woke up at 6a.m couldnt get back to sleep so I figured hey why not. She woke up to the door shutting when I went outside. She went to check on me saw I was not in my bed and very rightfully panicked thinking I had been taken. In her panic she ran to the front door swung it open and yelled for me while I was in the car then she did the same with the garage door. However when she did it with the garage door she didnt move out of the way and hit herself in the right eye with the edge of the door and had a black eye for a while. So if when he kicked it she was in the right spot it is very possible.
no jou ken hav a blakk ai
a door can not give you  a black eye he puncher in the eye Call 911
It gave my dad two black eyes
U are so smart
A door cant give you a black eyes however, a door handle can
This nigga swoozie go in his closet and press random
13:52 thecse lol
I ran to my door and I can confirm yes in can hit  ur eye
They know I'm here
yes a door can easily cause a black eye
Rip to the old people named bob out there 😂
Ok, stop, so you're telling me you found this perfect girl you super like, you said no to her because "she's clingy", and then she calls you up to check if you want to be with her one more time, you pull every muscle to say no, and you make a video badmouthing her soon to be husband right now? Is the toxic relationship the one between you and her where you're both toxic people? You for stringing her along and her for not letting you go even in a serious relationship?
Man with fedora hat gives me relationship advice      Me:the lord has praised me
A door can kinda bruise you but not usually
Bandit, the acountabilibudy
You cant tell me you didn’t check your thumb size when he was talking about meeting ann
Just looked it up, it says a door can give you a black eye so.
Swooz the handle ooooooor ze corner
Unless she’s like two feet tall then I don’t think you can get a black eye from that
I got a black eye from a door
Yh the relationship is way more toxic from what it looks like
Swoozie great advice but you should have let her stay with you even if she was clingy
Damn bruh u a playa
Matt is fond boss
13:31 I am lost I am lost I am looooooooooooost I am lost

шош
I got a black eye from a door depends on the angle it hits you from
The door knob
You should be a tharepest

Love your videos
The doorknob could have hit her in the right place and she got a black eye from the door
Ms paint lol
NOTHING MORE BETTER THEN FAMILY
if she was tall the corner of the door could give a black eye
i am rewatching this and `ann might be hannahxxrose because she is a gamer and hannah has the word ann in it ..... sooooooooo
Toxic ppl never believe they are toxic. How can I know I'm not the toxic one in the relationship?
My guess for the black eye is that the door hit her nose and caused the black eye. Your nose, eyes, and ears and all connected, so when the door might of hit her nose it could’ve caused the black eye.
Aigth listen if the door hit her on her eye it would be the corner and if she ran didn't she locked the door and he hit  it open it would take a couple of hits then even more
The nice ones are the easiest to hypnotize sWooz... See, in truth most women do not want a straight and narrow in relationships and who they get with, honestly speakin they much rather have a soapie of a relationship, devastating lows with mournin and grief then exhilarating highs of joy and happiness  This tricks them into thinking they've infact formed a deep connect and pact with you, and that you are a huge part of their life so they can't simply detach from what they identify as a part of them... it is sad really. But don't mix this in with love, if a guy/girl does this intentionally to form the said bond to simply chain other then it is only hypnosis, but if their feelings are the same it really isn't as both fall to the psychedelic trip that is "Love"  Hope this is understandable
Ok, I have a question for anyone whose willing to give an answer. I’ve been in a toxic relationship before and I’ve always had this question of, If your a toxic person whose always toxic and then stop, do old habits die hard? Or how does that work?
The black eye door thing is likely because I have been close the getting one with a door
His parents are racist, he gave her a black eye, he cheated on her and they got married... I hope that this relationship isn’t toxic anymore or else this guy just asked her to marry him because he needs to put a big step into the relationship other than sorting out the problems in the relationship. btw Swoozie love your videos man ❤️
I got a black eye from a door knob
Yeah my parents were still living in the same house even when they were divorced when I was young. I don't remember what it was like really other than from what stories my mom has told me, but I'm sure it wasn't fun at all.
La llorona's husband felt like he couldn't leave either dude Soo toxic relationships are always gonna be around but they can be fixed
Since the N64 star fox story I started following you and after every love story I concluded... we have the same level of salt bro... hands down... but... it's all in what you make of it and learn from it so stay positive
I'm sorry but Swoozies "WOOOOW" killed me 😅
Oh dope, we have a Counter in New York, too. They rule.
sWooZie is my new therapist
Imagine those toxic people watching this
Only if the eye was lined up with the crevice in the door
I feel like swoozie be dumping loads into anyone who steps foot in his place😂😂😂
for her getting the black eye she hit her forehead and bruised it, then the blood will travel down to the eye causing a black eye im guessing not a doctor
Ok so a door can cause a black eye but it’s it’s not that common so it might have happened but there’s a good chance that’s not what happened
There was a kid in my class he was very short he hit his eye on a doorknob giving him a black eye
Ennnh, the fedora is pretty moderate, but fezzes are cool  (This is a terraria/movie referance)
the term is called *man clown* my friend if yk yk
Yeah...that guy punched her. I got hit by a door on my face once. (Yeah it hurted like shit xD)The whole side gets black not only the eye. I think he attempted to hit her but the door broke the impact and maybe she was confused as to what happened. I'm still sad that she got married to that terrible person. I really Hope nothing happens to her
Swoozie you sexy or whatever....
Preach Swoozie!!!
Yo this sounds like one of my friends, I drove her to the police station to file a restraining order cuz he kept harassing and stalking her online, tried blackmailing her, verbally abused her, stalking her at her work. They got back together!
If anyone knows the ann girl Instagram please slide it
theres alot of stories that swoozie has i gotta believe that its hard to keep track of all them . swoozie do you keep tabs of these girls ? write what happens in your notes or have a  bulletin board of pictures and notes with strings wrapped around them connected back to you lmao.
Door nob or handle could of hit her
"If you break up with me, you're never gonna find anyone better than me"  ...  Sure buddy. Keep telling urself that. pfttt HAHAHA  7 (damn near 8) BILLION people on this planet..and this guy thinks he's on top 😂😂🤣🤣
I know I’m very late to the video but got dam that girl needs help shit lol
You are the best at making these types of vids
That was suchhhhh an amazing deal
My mom got a back eye by walking into a door in the dark lol. Definitely possible.
love the fit!
So i just googled it and u r 41?????????????
I just rember Swoozie is 49
Ann is noisy butters
I love your videos. I’m from Italy
When will you next video come 😭
0:55 😂😂 only millenials will know
Dayum
Are you fucking kidding me first you wanna say oh my god she’s fucking gorgeous and I gotta wife that and fast forward youre fucking saying she came on too clingy
he probably kicked the door hard
Ight now I gotta go eat at the counter
take a shot every time he dramatically says why.
I mean a door knob could be just small enough to maybe hit ur eye but the chances are slim XD
I wanna know who the girl is
If your head is at an angle, you could hit the corner of the door
I think it was the door I think it was the boy because it might have been the door that hit her but he was the one who put so much pressure on the door to make it do that much damage to the woman so I would have said the boy and also he's the one who met her in the bathroom making her up I get black by the door in the bathroom so it's only to him so it was his fault
Swoozie: “Get happy before going into a relationship”   Me: Guess I’m not getting into a relationship then.
WOooooww a door can't give you a black eye 🤣 sus AF
“I’ve been in a toxic relationship once or thrice”
Swoozie where did you get you bed set furniture from??? Looks nice AF 👌
Wooooooooow
Take it easy and Be Safe ✌️😈💜
You can get a black eye from a door... I say this with experience. However it didn't swing into my eye. It went straight for the kill, and the corner of the door ended up hitting me in the eye. And that my friends is why doors are sentient.
yo you still a virgin?
Here’s her club penguin
👩‍🚀🌊 What song?  FIRST TO REPLY RIGHT GETS SHOUTOUT
I’m sorry. But I think she made that story up.
did y’all know Swoozie’s 41 years old

Wow that's crazy 😶 I once had a guy tell me u better not leave or ill kms and I got scared and a whole bunch of craziness happened but I got out after a month of him telling me that thank goodness
A door nobb can give your black eye I think (Ouch) 🙊
Congrats You got a new subscriber (ME) You are funny 👍
Clingy women are pretty bad. But you'll find a S.O. one day
"Relationships should add to your happiness; not be the reason for your happiness."  YEESSSSS THANK YOU; some people need to HEAR THIS. Over, and over, and over, time and time again.
A door can definitely give you a blackeye
That is a clean fedora

Is anyone watching videos like these because your scared your toxic?
Yes a door can give u an black eye
I was in a toxic relationship yea that was bad she’s gone now
She was trying to better deal this dude.
She's co-dependent and in a way she is toxic as well. You said she is clingy.. she is probably extremely dramatic and attracts men who are the same. She may very well have good intentions but she keeps making dumb/rash choices without thinking things through. She is allowing the chaos that is her life. It's probably always been like that for her. Very sad.
Bro my Nan name is Ann
You really second guessed yourself becuase she was clingy. Bruh— she’s in an abusive relationship and the place where she stays they hate her. On top of that her boyfriend cheated on her— why would you need to time to think if you were going to help her or not?!
I got a headache just from hearing that story. Sounds like the girl is a chronic capper...I may be wrong. Just sounds way off to me.
Why the hell does this shit sound like stockholm syndrom.
That advice at the end,beautiful😭❤
This man always knows what to say thanks swoozie 🙏🏽
Swozzie just makes out with girls left and right and makes it seem like he ain’t a player.
Eyes are the most sensitive part of the body or one of the most sensitive so it would take longer to heal unless she has it like straight in her eye the door probably did hit her
Maybe she is codependent.  “It can be hard to distinguish between a person who is codependent and one who is just clingy or very enamored with another person. But, a person who is codependent will usually:  Find no satisfaction or happiness in life outside of doing things for the other person.  Stay in the relationship even if they are aware that their partner does hurtful things.  Do anything to please and satisfy their enabler no matter what the expense to themselves.”    from MedicalNewsToday)    And lists goes on but you can recover from  it by going therapy etc.
As someone who actually did get a black eye from a door, it is possible. It happened when I was in high school. I was goofing around and annoying a friend. I also ran to the bathroom to hide. I did it a couple times and the last time I messed up locking the door fast enough and when they opened the door it hit me in the face and it was my first and last black eye.
I get my head on the door by opening the door, I was little when that happened, so yeah.
The only way a door could give you a black eye is if it hits the middle of your nose bone and it will cause both of your eyes to be black not just one
Swoozie is my guy I’m always looking forward to his videos

West Orange high-school 🔥🔥🔥
Door knob can or if your face is angled correctly
*love this*
Yo is it pokimane that he’s talking about
Sheeesh swoozie lookin drippy drippy
0:59 your welcome
I agree humans dont have flat faces, i get your confusion. BUT. I can definately see a bruise on upper cheek, so lower eye socket. I think a lot of ppl would call that a black eye.
Happy Birthday (im a day late oops)
Who’s Ann?
I get it I hope go but at a slow smooth pour dont race to the top
Trying understanding you
What a tragedy
Love seeing how your channel grew man been here since the first kiss episode keep on working
Happy birthday Swoozie!
If a one of my friends boyfriend hurts them in any kid of way they gonna fight me
Color your characters and backgrounds PLEASE
Swoozie truly is a scholar and has taught me well :)
is ann, pokimaine?
She got a black eye instead of a black guy
sWooZie never gets a break jeez 😂😬
Swoozie not a virgin anymore?  He doesn't wear a cross anymore. swag.
The only way she would get a black eye is that the door knob hit which means she was on the floor
I remember being in this girl's shoes, it took me so long to realize my self worth isn't determined by a dude and I shouldn't stoop my standards so low because I just wanted somebody to love me... Because I didn't love myself. I hope this girl realizes the same and gets out of that toxic marriage.
Rip club penguin.. 😣
Hahahaha
6:45*already ahead of time running to the bathroom*
Wait wait he’s gonna see this video so you’re doing this for you
If the story keeps going imma need a part 2 this was 🔥
Notice us non-toxic young women! :)
Swoozie who do you think would have won Kendrick or drake for that rap battle
Did this man say club penguin 😂😂
I honestly think this is one of the best videos you've made man itz a situation almost everybody can relate to
I’ve gotten a black eye from a door before the corner smacked my eye
That portion control metaphor was everything
I got out of a toxic relationship about half a year ago, and for a while I was wondering if I was the toxic one. For sure there were things I could have done way better. But my ex started some shit two days ago and confirmed to me that she was the toxic one.
Listenn if she got a whole black eye from the door itself id expect a line straight down the face🤔 but ifvit where the door knob it would be a different story, i could be wrong but thats some rough stuff man💯 hope shits well
Do these girls you talk about don’t watch ur  vids ?
Moral of story, be a piece of shit to females cause thats what want they, specially nowadays 😴💯
I wanna watch you to sleep.....but your to interesting......it's 2:53 and I can't sleep cause your vids are interesting
If you're still curious about the whole black eye door thing, my great grandma got a black eye from opening her microwave so...I guess it can happen? Hope this helps???
I looked it up and a door can give you a blackeye
I love clingy because I'm kinda clingy
“Know your value and add tax” -sWooZie that is the best quote I have heard in a while
Praise God!💜 Good stuff. God bless you abundantly!
Who else spent the rest of the video trying to figure out how she got a black eye from a door
My guy what type of bandaid do you have? Toy story, monsters inc??
hey swoozie I think what happened with anne and the black eye is that anne was probably running away from him and when she ran into the bathroom she probably put her face close to the door so she can lock it (if it even had a lock), but then the bf kicked it open, so the edge of the door hit her, but that's what I'm thinking happened haha
Ann is Pokimane
SWOOOZ I MISSED YOUR CONTENT BRO!!
You should look up 6 myths you probably believe about the American Revolution by cracked on YouTube and there is no unemployment crisis by xkcdhatguy on YouTube  and why we should choose monarchy by ted talk on YouTube
"Know your value, and add tax" words of pure wisdom. Also hope Anne is all right, that situation just sounds yikes all around.
So a door can’t really give u a black eye  it would have to be really hard for that to happen but if she got hit with the door knob that’s different
"I've been in a toxic relationship once or Thrise"
I just got out of a relationship and now I'm here
Late but the corner of the door could’ve hit her eye
Maybe it was the door nob that gave her a black eye
I really dont think its the door
智商掉了一地...
Dog I'm gonna be honest with u a door couldnt get u a black eye she got hit
I just realize is swozy gay
Know your value and add tax  Sheeeeesh swoozie you spoke to my heart
"Know your value...and add tax" oh ma GAURD I might have to get that tattooed or at least put it on a shirt or something. This man has amazing quotes for DAYS!
It's the wowwww for me...😂😂😂
Throw a couple whiteclaws and some mike's hard and you can absolutely get a black eye from a door.
Why did it take 2 weeks for me to see this
I was in a toxic relationship where my girlfriend dumped all her problems on me and told me I was the reason she was unhappy keep in mind we never argued never had problems the only time we bickered was over this anime and how it ended but after that we just made up and moved on cause it wasn’t important. Also she had been extremely distant and would say she forgot about me or she’d get mad at me for no reason or whatever. So when she told me I made her so unhappy and what not I apologized took responsibility took all the weight of our relationship on my shoulders then asked to just be friends. Okay good we’re just friends then she goes to say she doesn’t want to talk at all for a few weeks. I said okay and a few days go by and I make a post on my account (I’m a artist and post fanart) explaining to my followers that I went through a break up but wanna focus on myself get happy again and move on and say that I want to make art for myself for awhile and not fanart. This girl starts posting about me upset that I publicly announced the break up she texted me saying she’s completely done with me and doesn’t want to be friends I didn’t name her or say anything bad about her but she flew off the handle and blocked me on everything and now I feel like so much weight is off my chest and like I can finally breathe now that they’re gone.
Bro one of these days you have to do a house tour. I’ve been dying to see what it looks like.
I don't think he realized that the girl (anne) was being toxic with him. She was clearly trying to lead him on and using swoozie as a pity friend/for attention
My ex threatened to spill horrible personal things about me to my family if I left him, he threatened to kill himself, he would call me and sob, he'd guilt trip me in every way saying all he did was love me and that all he wanted was to make me happy. Five. Years. I let that go on for five years before I finally just left. Not too long after the (last) breakup I met my new bestfriend who was leaving in a couple weeks to propose to his girlfriend. He came back after a week or so and things started going down hill. She was horrible. She'd send him pages about how much of a disappointment he was, how much she hated him, and every time she'd tell him to leave her alone, she'd call and pull him right back in again, fast forward a year, they're not engaged any more, give it two months. Guess who ended up together? I couldn't love him more.  Don't stay just because you think, oh I've given them this, I've spent this time with them, they might hurt themselves, we have this history, they're the one. G e t  o u t . They will never be right for you.
This true stuff
That’s an abusive relationship and are extremely difficult to leave😓
That "friend" sounds like she's a bit radioactive herself. You were only hearing oneside of the story, hers. She probably likes drama. Dodged a bullet with that one.
Online in a toxic household with my house/flatmates.
Swoozie Dosent realize she’s the toxic one
Can you do another school or high school animation plzzzzzz 🙏
14:12 I feel like MANY people should listen to this bit seriously.
Man I feel bad for her the good guy thought she was clingy (might not be her first time being rejected for that) but the toxic guy is going to exploit that so if that’s the kind of persons that is receptive to her being clingy then she might think that’s the best she can get. Man I hope she finds her value and chooses herself
This man got the best videos bruh it help me learns so much about life Respect my G
(Wow)
if you break your nose, yoou get blackeye
Maybe she hit her eye on a corner
A man aproches you,he's wearing a fedora,he wants to give you relationship advice, godspeed you magnificent bastard
i would let her stay she seems nice
this video is longer i am so appreciative since i just got into a relationship too
Love swoozie
It’s sssniperwolf right?
Yeah, a door can give you a black eye. However the person needs to be positioned in a certain way.
this may be a bit of a hot take, but this girl, kind, generous, friendly, fun to be around, you have a lot in common, and she's a 10. But you went into it looking for a flaw, you were trying so hard to find it which doesn't make sense to me, everyone has flaws, and imo being a little clingy isn't that bad dude, like you could have just controlled the pace yourself, idk man doesn't make sense to me, but at the end of the day thats your choice, i prob would have made a different one. That being said it's crazy how nice people like that get trapped in toxic relationships and we prob didn't get to see her 'crazy' side because you chose not to pursue who knows. either way i just wanted to point out that searching for flaws in people is pretty toxic too bro, doesn't matter if you're a guy or a girl, something to think about
I don't know but maybe she didn't want to rent cause there's no furniture? or she didn't want to commit to a location just yet, and because you declined it, she knew u were uncomfortable with her in ur house. which may or may not cement whatever toxic thing her boyfriend said. probably along the line of "u have friends but none would take u in" im not putting the blame on people. I'm just trying to understand why someone would decline such a good offer.
There really aren't words for this dude ♡
He married her to avoid you from getting the rebound which is why he asked that stupid question, then he probably most definitely looked you up and saw you as a threat, next he will knock her up to try and lock her down if he hasn't already. I've had that happen to me plenty of times before.
Gaurantee she got manipulated by that man who was toxic regardless if that man was a different race, tbh it probably helped the toxicity,,, especially if woman are considered less in that mans eyes
but what if they say their willing to change? how do you know if its all lies?
8:51 the door knob I'm thinking
She got attack because my dad slam !!! The door in my face
Bro your one of the wisest tubers outchea
OMG I HAVENT WATCHED YOU SINCE LIKE 7th GRADE I THINK. IM A JUNIOR IN HIGHSCHOOL NOW THATS CRAZYYY. i missed you fren
I’m 12 and I’ve already been in two toxic relationships, they both told me that they would end there life if I broke up with them 😃👍
Know your value and add tax 👏👏. Ima make a story about my toxic relationship
Damn. “know your value and add tax” is a damn good quote
Woooowww
8:39 woke up Chris breezy
"Know your value and add tax." Love it. I just sent this to my roommate who is in a toxic idk what to call it with our other roommate who also has a boyfriend. It's gettin weird.
If they say you're never going to find anyone better than them, you're definitely gonna find someone better than them.
I got a black eye from a door. 😭
you could have knocked that chick out...
What started as a great thing in swoozies life in a another ended with a bitter happiness
Jesus that girl is me when it comes to giving too much too quick and I moved in with my bf after two months as well. I don't know how to explain it but I simply can't go slow? It's actual torture.
I like clingy people. No one likes me so at least one person appreciates me😞
Not him playing Brittney 😂
Bro is so true with the clinginess of girls sometimes.
I actually fell on a door and got a black eye so it is possible
I am pretty sure you were her back up and would only communicate with you when she needed something . Good decision on not taking her in because her boyfriend would of shown up and she would of left with him. But she did like u a lot , it just wasn’t meant to be.
Gotta check for da ring thats the number 1 priority
Are you married because I see that golden drip.
She has a huge…. Heart
random tip in cooking put about a spoon full of butter and then it makes egg very buttery and delicious

Will my boy swoozie finally have a happy story, is swoozie BALDING, will swoozie finally get the 10mil subs he deserves   FIND OUT NEXT TIME ON an anime series people love because it was expertly tailored towards kids who like martial arts and Superman
“Know your value and add tax!” 💯🙌🏾
Relationship should add to your happiness, not be the total reason for it (and definitely not be the reason for your depression 😅): So true sWooZie✌️✌️
How the heck did they get married when his parents hated her 🤯
I love that. "Know your value, and add tax. "  XD
Toxic is definitely different than abusive tho and you can’t love and change abusive people. She sounds potentially toxic bc she doesn’t understand boundaries but he sounds straight up abusive because he’s physically hurting her and emotionally manipulating her. I hope she gets out of that toxic/abusive ass relationship.
She probably slid into like the bathroom then hurry up and close the door while she was on her knees then the doorknob hit her eye
How many friends do you have on Xbox?🤯
Ann: I'll get out of your hair  Me: what hair ???😩
The gaming community is 45% girls It depends what you play and what platform and a lot of women hide as boys so they don't get hit on
How to tell if somebody is toxic  Step 1: check if they are oozing toxic waste Step 2: check if they are melting Step 3: check if you grow extra body parts around them
Bro have you even talked about the Mr beast battle royal you were in I found your name so I'm asking???
Get this man to 10mil he deserves it and who ever watched him when u were little then ur a og and love you and keep up the good work man :]
Ever just watch swoozie till 5:34 am then wake up at 1:09 pm, realize you have school, then realize your on summer break then realize your dreaming the whole time. Then you wake up for real and it’s actually 1:09 pm and you realize your late for school but you don’t have school then you realize it’s just like your dream and you fall asleep because it’s only 1:09 pm and you normally sleep in till 3:04 and when you wake up at 3:04 you start watching swoozie again…… anyone have that happen to them???
This helps me understand more on some situations I’ve been in
ō-ō
who know the @
bro u said she had af and all that shiii
I can't lie, those adlibs help the mood a lot "WOOOOOWW"
Who was the girl??
Yo thanks for new vid swoozie
That whole story made me smad.
Loved the vid and I already found the girl after like 2 minutes. Saw a fine gamer girl checked her Insta saw she was married and that’s it. Maybe I’m just built different 🧐🧐🧐🧐
Oh swoozie idk how I feel about the fadora
That’s true OK Time I hurt my eye on the door and I didn’t get a blackeye so he’s she’s lying
Love from Trinidad and Tobago
Build up relationship. Like can I be your friend, straight up✨👌🏽
Thank you for the advice  And I feel like you were heart broken but l also feel like you will not be very sad  And she is an idiot
Once or thrice 13:46
A bit of advice for everyone: when he says be happy on your own before being with somebody else, that's good advice. That doesn't mean that you have to leave if you need time to work on yourself. It just means that if you're in a healthy relationship, you won't feel like your entire life and happiness depends on them staying there with you. If you can become your own person, you have a clear mind that allows you to make better decisions, and you don't have that when you rely on somebody else so heavily. If you're happy on your own first, you can still be in a strong, healthy relationship. And to those of you who have built up your walls, it may not feel like the love you may have experienced in a previous relationship, but give it time and it will become something better.
Just one word about all this... wowwwwwwww
She needed a hero, swoozie told her to try Jesus 🎵.
Swoozie  attracted to more toxic women, she was a different type of compound.
First all I don’t like to be that guy friend she tells all her stories
Toxicness is of the dark side! It must be resisted!
sWooZie : "A few month ago we talked about toxic friends"   Just a few months  *11 months ago*
Bro I dated a toxic girl she made me cry eventually leading me to leave and go home and she said it was my fault for her making me cry 💀
Swoozie low-key smart with that if I die this is my killer😂
Dose anyone else watch Sw0ozi while you eat ??? or is it just me
My guy like your foot will hit the door first if she has a black eye because of the door then she would be falling in a 90° Angle which is not real her bf hit her my guy
You are the most wisest man I ever saw on youtube
Yo swoozie, I swear since last year all the way to now...youve helped me get more confidence. You got some epic tips yo. So thanks man. Low-key kinda like a father I never had. Lol
Even if he kicks the door her forehead would get hit first her eye wouldn’t feel nun
If a woman ends up telling me to choose between her or my dog, I'm not even going to say anything. She already knows the answer and there's the door
what was that song at 0:55
Holy shit he still has a channel
How long i didint wach him but now im back
Hey SWooZie! Got a new video recommendation for you and need sum advice. Can you do a video on whether you have feelings for a girl but not sure if you do or not. Please and thank you!
I didn't really understand the bottle analogy Swooz can you explain it to me
I make better art 🥺🥺🥺🥺
a door CAN  give you black eye
Wow I haven't seen you in my reccomended in quite a few years! It's been so long, gotta be at least 5-7 years
Great message ... but sorry man, I couldn't get over how your headboard overlaps your window.  But that's my hurdle in life to get over, hahaha
The corner of the door hit her face! She probably didn’t mention that…
J.Cole made a song about this….
:me hearing the story 14 mins later me: woooooow
My first relationship was toxic af. She was a horrible person, but what I gained out of it was what to look for and what not to look for in a person, and in a relationship.
Ive given myself a black eye with a door, its definitley possible.
8:58 but a door knob can
Bruh this guy is the goat 😭
His animation has devolved
I actually have a video of my neighbor in college getting a black eye from a door lol
Thanks for the video Rachel ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Everytime I hear you saying "no way this girl is just out here single" I think "no way this man is out here SINGLE??"
I have the same chess board.
Life advise with swoozie
....And add tax
Dude, you acted like an idiot. You can figure out yourself why.
haven't watched sWooZie in years, I missed how positive and motivating he his.
This man is dropping bombs 👏🏾💙
Swoozie shouldve just let her crash at his place for the month 🤦🏻‍♂️
I'm starting to think he is just the toxic one, cause he always talks bad about her exes. And he always chooses the crazy ones. Maybe the whole story is not like that.
Know ur value and add tax.  Best ADVICE  EVER
My fedora is trying to leave and fly to wherever you are at
I love how he’s like “her body is FINE” and I’m just looking like huh yeah that bump is amazing😂🤣
What if the girl is like 1000000 times better than you. And every guy wants her
Yes, a door can give you a black eye. It happened to me when I was four LOL.
Love this video
Make a tutorial on how to beatbox grinding by eclipse PLEASE!
Make a tutorial on how to beatbox grinding by eclipse PLEASE!
Why are you wearing a hat inside?
The Thumbnail is great.
“We make out…a lot” mmhmmm Mr Swoozie, we know what u mean 👀
Solid advice, there’s no joke just learn from this video.
🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹
You should make a video about the people you have saved ppl when you were a lifeguard
Bruh how old are you to give relationships advices?
Oh god. I’m toxic.
"Know your value, and add tax" such a great line. Also I feel like "abusive" describes these relationships better but I understand that for youtube purposes you probably had to tone down the language
This girls body is crazy, her body:    | <   |
If the face is turned to the side it could hit the eye head on.
I think a door can give a black eye if it hits you at the right angle
As someone who had an abusive parent unless you are the height where the door nob is near your eyes you would not get a black eye drops m the flat door unless it's the door nob he hit her
Her head mightve been tilted a bit, since she's running, so when he kicked the door into her face, it could've been the edge of the door that hit her eye  Does that make sense
With the hat I think of neyo
swOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOzie  new episode dude
One video that I watch all the time from you is fast and furious
I’ve dated a guy online who was not only toxic asf but a ped too. He lied about.. three times about his real name. If I talk about a guy I’ve interacted he gets mad and all depressive. Not only the fact but he randomly breaks up with me without a reason, blocks me leaving me CLUELESS and mentally/emotionally in a reck. Comes back for a few minutes saying we can be friends. THE MANS TELLS ME HE LOVES ME LIKE? Dude- WHY ARE YOU TELLING THAT TO SOMEONE. Later about a year or several months a girl I knew before that was actually dating him before we got together. She disconnected from social media and I didn’t know where she went. But turns out she was only texting him on phone. So the whole entire time we were dating, HE WAS DATING HER. And she blames me. Like? Okay blame me while your boyfriend says that you no longer exist when really he was texting you on your number then dates me without me knowing he was cheating on both of us. I’m telling you that relationship was complete wack and I was the monster at the end. Note: the girl who he was dating was at least 14 and he was 19.
thanks swooz ❤️
a door can give a black eye as someone who’s walked Into PLEANTY doors it can give a black eye
Man spitting fax
Wow
You missed the perfect girl maaan.... I am so sorry for your loss Rachel. :(
Bro I need to know what happens next with your group tho
I disagree with Swoozie. Chess does not make good life decisions. I played chess many times and I make bad decisions 80% at a time.
Yes a door can give you a black eye😂
Anything can give you a black eye I was 9 running around the house I trip and go face first into a couch
That hat lookin good ngl
Uploaf
the nob hit her
Hey bro theres some one on TikTok that is stealing all your content with no credit
Hey Rachel
"Know your value. And add tax." ❤
When someone slammed a door in my face near the eye I developed a really big bump but not a black eye so I think you can't?? Maybe XD
Annemunation I think
“Know your value and add tax” ima say that all the time because facts
What’s with the fedora?!
I think she might have had her head tilted to an angle that she could be hit by a door.
Swoozie I think you should just leave her alone she sounds like a great person but the part where shes making this guy sound unbelievable I think it's not true she may be making it up to get with you in any way but don't get mad at her just leave
Girls remember this- There's aways more fish in the sea• Never let a man abuse you• Don't abuse men• Don't cheat or lie to him•  if you think he loyal and golden hearted he could be the one, don't assume he will date you• And never date someone who says  I'll kill my self if you leave me
8:58 door nob unless she's tall
Umm what 😹😹😹 wtf is wrong with her
The door handle can give u a black eye
Bro, this is probably one of the best videos I’ve seen from you. Soooooooo relatable. Keep goin’ bro. As a brotha who’s just startin’ this YouTube game, I look up to you.
This came out a bit too late for me
Best YouTuber
He’s vids are funny and realistic
can donate world name: TTANN
A door handle
Hearing all that about your friend reminds that that I truly don't understand people's relationships or their decisions in them 😕
woaaaah enlightening
The door bruising thing, it's possible bc you can turn a certain way to the side and the door can open and hit you at the side of your head or really close to your eye
Swoozie i think you forgot to edit the lil background music
I dumped a guy for picking me over his family. I’m like I want to go out for brunch with my mother in law and have a great time. Don’t ruin that for me!
That mans hit her wit the mac truck deluxe
I'm way too nice for my own good. I'd let her stay a month
Something I learned is the iron triangle. A woman usually has two of three traits. Gorgeous, smart and emotionally stable. If she's gorgeous, then she's either smart or crazy. You almost never get all three in one person. If she find her she's a unicorn and marry her 😂
As someone who has been around alot of toxic guys, i really appreciate you talking about this. To this day, im still recovering from them. Abuse and manipulation are very much real and it can affect you. It may not affect you right away, but it could hit you later on and it comes on strongly Update: i just recently left a relationship that became toxic once i broke up with him
SHOULD OF SAID YES
no! you are definitely correct swoozie!! Nobody can get a black eye from a just a door hitting them. She definitely got punched by the dude.
“Know your value… and add tax” why tf did I never think about that bc that was clean af
"Know your value add tax"💯‼
No door couldnt do that i tested it
0:54 also hypercrit...
"They got married." :/ SCREAMMMM—
bruh stop the cap "no girls like this talk to me"
She was ready to settle down, you were first choice, miss the ship. I can tell by  her timing.
"know your value. and add tax" is an INCREDIBLE LINE, holy shit. well effin' done with that one.
Ur fedora is just popping off my guy
"Know your value... and add tax." Going to be using that a lot in the future
13:31 me: “Cough” “Cough” 😐
I'm toxic 😔
Thanks for the new video!
How does sWooZie not have a discord server
Not much u can do, sad tbh
That is a great analogy
i'm just wondering if you got permission to tell her story like this? what if either of them sees this and this puts her in a dangerous situation? no hate bc i love you & your videos, just concerned! <3
“A few months ago we talked about toxic friends” *bro that was almost a year ago*
I personally feel some part of her story was a lie just go get to you Or prolly date you
I don't know why I've spent 15 minutes on this, looks like you're a great storyteller. The thing is that's how the people are. Many want to be submissive, many want to be dominated. Especially women. There may be plenty of different reasons for that, but in the end of the day - It's what many of them want. Western culture tries to deny it for centuries (today it got out of control), but It is what it is. No wonder why Marquis de Sade's works are popular for centuries, especially among women
Swoozie, at a certain point you gotta ask, is it me or them?
This was hilarious 😂
A door can 100% give you a black eye. I have a big head, and as a kid I was basically blind in my left eye. I swung my bedroom door open thinking I was standing to the side of it and whacked myself dead on my left eye. Gave me a black eye, I was so confused.
the chess reference was a Bar 💯
“Know your value. And add tax” T-SHIRT NOW PLEASE
Swoozie with the words of wisdom
YES IT CAN A DOOR CAN give you a blackeye it happened to me 😢
“Is her left thumb bigger than her right thumb?”  Way to call out my girlfriend Swooz 😂
Call bandit ur Po for Patrol officer
Swoozie why didn’t you just wife her up in the first place and why didn’t you let her stay with you then wife her up then😭
"Know your value and add tax" I'm just gonna print this out and frame it real quick.
Look this is constructive criticism, I like your videos however... Adressing women as "females" is very demeaning. Why not just say women?? Even if you don't mean it in a negative way, there are way too many guys who treat women like shit and use "females" as a way to sound condescending. Just a thought
such a good creator bro good shit
That's not just toxicity...she's being abused. That's coming from experience
As someone who has run into stuff constantly as a kid, I've hurt my head, nose, and mouth, but never gotten a black eye...
Snip snip done
Your not explaining it right but I get what you mean and he used the door knob for the black eye
14:11 i have to disagree, whenever I'm in a relationship, I feel super motivated and it's like Im on drugs but when I'm single I feel like life is pointless.
1:00 wait this is toxic 🤷🏻‍♂️ huh, I thought this was a normal thing 🙃
nice v..
you don't get black eyes by being punched in the eye... you get black eyes by your nose being hit .... that's why you get black eyes after nose surgery....
Ann  Uhm Strangest person I’ve ever heard about
Someone let me know who this is I just wanna know if she’s ok and if she’s actually fine
I don't think a door can give someone a black eye I think she lied and didn't want tell the truth cause some girls do that
Red flags left and right. It's sad but like someone said, "sometimes giving a second chance is like giving them an extra bullet. for their gun because they missed the first time." I know it's not always like that but still.
Swoozie: Cause ain't no way, you this fine, trying to talk to lil old me. Me: Boi have you LOOKED in the mirror? I'm surprised when someone DOESN'T wanna try to talk you up
No cap but she sounded like a white valley girl
Hey swoozie you should uhh like this comment if u like popcorn
Ayo swoozie i don't think the door gave her the black eye bro He came at her and hurt her my man Cause AIN'T NO WAY A DOOR GON HIT YOU THAT HARD  She ain't tell you tho probably cause she was scared the toxic bf was gon hit her
Mans having the dream talking to girl
Hey I know that voice of the dude you called that's my uncle
So anyone figured out who Ann is?
“KNOW YOUR VALUE AND ADD TAX” ❤️
sWooZie 2 year ago you had to go to this mr beast game why didn't you make a video and if you did send me the link
the bottle... that is the best analogy i ever seen
I can’t believe this man interviewed Obama
She was obviously running wild at the time and ran straight into the devil.
•_•
Lol he said a few months 😂😂
💀💀from what I know a door really CANT give you a black eye
Swoozie. Something to the tune of 7 years ago, when I was ~9 years old, I got my phone taken away because I was watching one of your videos. It was something about always going for the ugly girl, and I can't find it. I'm pretty sure it was animated, and my time frame is rough but it had to be 2014-15ish. I scrolled back to that time but couldn't find anything with that title, do you have any idea what video that could be? I'm not expecting an actual response here. I just wanted to comment on that video and say I got grounded for watching it, but I don't know what video it is. All the best, your fan since the age of 8, -ned
Yep
Sounded like she was also playing chess. . "If I go live with Swoozie for a month, he'll see how good I am and a month will extend further". . Considering that she married to the same dude that cheated on her, this wouldn't come as a surprise. . .
I googled it, you can get a black eye from a door
Ann, if you're reading this comment LEAVE YOUR SHITTY BOYFRIEND/HUSBAND/PARTNER whatever. Get out. ASAP.
Yoo that story was WiLD.... reallly?
being just friends with a girl is a waste of time and money, don't bother with it seriously.... all that for just a single makeout? Not worth it at all. Either you're dating or nothing, time to be a man, not a little boy
You interviewed obama??????????
“Know your value... and add tax”  - Swoozie, 2021
the door probably hit around her eye
Honestly, I would have just GTFO & told her to deal with it because she’s too nice & soft to ever cope with that toxic relationship.
I mean a Door can give you a black eye if the corner catches you, but in that manner, a door being kicked swiftly, that sharp edge would probably bite into the skin and cut as well as leave a black eye. Soo if she got a black eye and no cut, probably not the door
It's the secret link and adding that tax for me.
Hey Swoozie Thanks for the really good advice about relationships, because Now I can look out for my Friends and Not be dumb, thank you for using your time to help anothers with Relationship. love your videos. Stay awesome Bro
“ I was just laying in bed thinking, humans don’t have flat faces” 😂😂😂
Do you know German
You could of stopped this ! She wanted you !!  But you didn’t like her clingyness… NO ONE DRIVES AN HOUR FOR A GAME FOR SOMEONE without it being beneficial to one self . And if that was her first message to you . I THINK YOUR HOT! Then you fell for it too …
I love this guy, he gives us amazing animations, nice story’s and gives us life long advice.
"know your value, and add tax" I love it. thanks <3
A door can't give someone a black eye
‘relationships should add to your happiness not be the reason you’re happy.’    no ❤️
So did you watch the new Rick and morty            Episode
I completely forgot about swoozies channel and damn I can’t express how fun it is to watch his videos again. Swoozie is the guy✌️
what happened to ur finger? :(
I see the title of this vid and I remember this one guy who would yell at me for talking to friends in my free time instead of talking to him even though we weren’t even dating and I only know him for like less than a month hahaha good times
door handle prolly hit her eye
If you hit the door hard enough it can give you a blackeye
yandere go brrr
Hahaah clown🤣🤣
this is so random but anybody suprised that he started his channel 2006 the year yt was made
Yo what about toxic sibs?
“know your value... and add tax”
Ever been with a girl so toxic you couldn't take her swimming for fear of being issued a court order for dumping toxic waste in the lake? Yea
next video toxic perents
story time turned valuable proportioning affection lesson, thank you
Swoozie always speaking them truths
I loooooove clingy girls. Shame on you for not appreciating a hot and clingy girl lol
Wow, you're way too paranoid on first dates. Talk about scaredy cat.
It could’ve been the corner of the door
I feel so shitty because I've done some of these things because of my exs use to do them to me so I got do used to it and I've tried to cut it out
Has he ever said what his gamertag is
My best friend friend always give me relationship advice but has never been in a relationship 😂 love it
Yeh swooze maybe he actually did hit her but I’ve gotten a black eye from a door sooo maybe she was telling the truth
“relationships should add to your happiness” best advice i’ve ever  heard
FINALLY someone who doesn’t just talk about toxic boyfriends! Like bitch I LIKE ALL GENDERS! well I have to get to know them first BUT STILL!
That black eye gives me “I ran into a pole” vibes
She's lying bro ,more than 50% part of the story
i had a toxic friendship lol
I was about to not watch bc its 4am but then I realize this a sWooZie story and it's about to get good so rip sleeping
7:27: “It’s over Swoozie! I have the high ground!”
5:10 IF SHE LOVES ONE PIECE SHE IS DAE WON

Have you listened to who I smoke on YouTube a thousand miles remix
wooooow.......
one piece miniskirt
If they try to trick you into thinking you can’t live your life without them, it’s def time to run
arent you the guy from youtube rewind 2018
Hey i know whar your taking abuot toxic relationship you're always demanding attention and always want you to block or stop taking to family or Friends so ya it sucks
I just got out of a relationship where the guy would get mad at me if I didn’t text him every day I get that communication is important but I don’t want to text you every day and when I broke up with him I still wanted to stay friends but every time I would talk with him he would bring up the that’s he’s super depressed and bummed out about how I dumped him when I very clearly didn’t want to talk about it and then he would ask why I was mad when I would get a little irritated at the fact he brought it up
A heavy door in my school once hit me in the face it gave me a big bruised gash down the side of my face bruised my collar bone and gave me a black eye.
I know a girl like this irl. Someone please explain the girl's POV and why she does what she does. I NEED TO UNDERSTAND
Yo when you coming to Canada
"Wooooooowww"
woooow
Same thing happened to me but it wws my brother he kicked the door amd the door hit me
And add tax, Lmao!
I’ve had a few friends in this situation and luckily they all got out. It’s crazy.
Just imagine alcoholics watching portion control explanation XD
Well sometimes there family is toxic and all the girlfriend wants is to have them set boundaries sometimes there mom be talking shit about the girlfriend 😒 so that's that
Homie in Paris?
Old fan got a new account abs forgot to sub missed these talks man keep em coming
U know dam well the detectives gonna find this girls gram
*[This is just a personal rant, skip this comment if you want]*  i can honestly relate to ann (sort of), i've been in a toxic and manipulative relationship for 2-3 years and i finally got out just a couple weeks ago. he would be the sweetest person in the whole world, next thing you know he's playing victim and forces his friends to do what he says. like, i knew i needed to break up with him, but because he was so sweet to me, i thought that i would never find someone as sweet as him if i broke up with him. i didn't listen to my friend's advice (which was to break up with him) because i was scared i might fuck something up. but i finally stood up to him, gave him the middle finger, and left.  so basically, just don't be scared. take your friend's advice into consideration, and do what's best for you.  also omelettes are swag
Yes you can get a black eye from a door slaming into you and I looked this up on Google
Jaaa Racheeeel 🤣🤞🏻🤞🏻
My major take away from this is that swoozie has commitment issues. The girl was legit ride or die and he missed out because, “she came on too strong”....
Did you know Brasso Venado when u were in Trinidad
I’m pretty sure a door can hit your eye slightly. If you’re standing in front of the door really close but your face slightly at an angle to it opening (so you’re kind of looking at the wall with your body facing the door)  the edge of the door as it’s opening can hit your eye and if he kicked it open, it could have been hard enough to leave a mark. So yeah it’s plausible
Love the WOW angle
Just got out of a toxic relationship glad I'm out I'm a free man.
Lets goo with the swOO
Thanks for the advice Rachel!
Door knob
I think its plausable that she got a black eye from the door tbh. The abuse probably didn't stop, generaly in these sorts of situations, the abuser will try to escolate the level of the relationship, ei. asking them to move in with them a month into the relationship, ei. getting married (several years in to be fair, but still). Def. a super sad story, hope she's able to get out of there :(
i tested it 26 times and you cant get black eye by a door so he abused her

I'm happy that I'm still single, even though I'm 21
Let her stay
😂😂 this guy gives perfect advice on what not to do. But he does it so much that I'm starting to think he likes it
Also note, the fastest way to corrupt a decent person is to have them stay in relationships with toxic people.   I had a close friend for over a decade and they decided to get into a toxic on off relationship with multiple people. Eventually they started adopting those toxic habits, and it reached the point that they aren't the same person anymore. Sure some of the core stuff is there, and you see glimpses of that when we hung out,  but the adopted habits come out a bit too much for me to want to continue being close friends with them. The thing is that other close friends noticed that same thing, and  we'd hope that keeping our distance for a while would be a wakeup call, that this behavior was driving wedges into long time friendships. Unfortunately,  it only made things worse and they more or less double downed in that bad behavior. In the past we were quick to forgive thinking that this is what good friends should do,  but overtime our friend began to interpret this as "I can do you dirty and you'll still forgive me and this is what a true friendship is". (This was a trait she had learned from her relationship with toxic people) After being burnt on multiple occasions, being gaslighted, and noticing that my friend was always in the center of some drama, (and of course they NEVER are the ones to start drama and don't understand how they got caught up into it) I eventually had to draw the line, and said it's either me who's been your loyal pal for over a decade or these chumps that seem to screw you over every other weekend. My friend bold face lied straight to my face, and said they would cut things off with said people and stop treating me in this way.   Later on I find out that they were lying, and to make matters worse I was out their defending them to other mutual friends, saying that they changed back to the person they once were. When I confronted my friend on this lie, I got gaslighted, and delivered more weak excuses. Eventually the toxic person ended up publicly humiliating them and they broke things off. My friend apologized and we were tentative friends, and I told them upfront that it would take time for our friendship to be restored, b/c of the past issues. They worked on it for a good 3-5 months, and things were improving. They were growing as a person and getting mentally healthy. Then another toxic person showed up and after doing me dirty again  2 out of 3 times. I said you need to get out of this relationship. They agreed and said that things were done. Only to be told 3 months later that they were in a relationship. I threw my hands up and then confronted them about what they said earlier. They basically admitted to "exaggerating" claims and statements they make to me in conversation, but stated that their intention wasn't to hurt me. My friend would start doing all these "nice" things to make up for it while still engaging in relationships with toxic people and then ask me to help and assist when the pieces broke.   I realized that this was taking a toll on me when my friends noticed that I was becoming an increasingly bitter person. It was  at this point that I realized that the toxic behavior was beginning to corrupt me, and I had to cut the friend off.  It definitely SUCKS that 10+ years investment into a friendship has turned to this. I truly hope my friend in the long term changes for the better, and stops surrounding themselves with toxic people, but I think at this point the best I can do is be a casual friend. It just sucks though b/c you see the disaster and pain filled road they are on but they don't. For their sake, I hope I'm wrong.
Toxic relationships are good when they are not bad or at least that is the only thing I can think of why someone would stay in that type of environment
I can relate to you so freaking hard man. It hurts
If u can’t get a girl there no hope for me swoozie
Sells is the girl was cheating on her.boyfriend. she was toxic. U so honest u aint know what going on
my man rachel dodged a bullet :/ she too sounds toxic as hell
Yes, it is possible to get a black eye from a door slamming into your face (from experience, I’m clumsy aight) BUT it doesn’t sound likely from the scenario you described.... I hope he didn’t lay his disgusting hands on her but it could be possible from how toxic he is.
I got hit in the face with a door before and that shit had me looking like Kakashi for a few weeks; But no black eye........
Lemme say this in a nice way….She’s on Drugs🥲
Where do i even begin, you talked to her for 4 YEARS and got scared from ONE nightstand cause she was clingy after, not only that but you kinda called her a simp for going great lengths buying you a sold out game? Am i missing something? do the rest of ya'll not do these super nice things for your best friends? Anyway, i dont think you should have gotten so scared from her being a lil clingy after that one night. its clear she hasnt been in a lot of relationships and is inexperienced with them. You kinda missed out. It also seems you're not very knowledgeable when it comes to toxic/abusive relationships. its very very hard to leave them. She needs professional help. I wish you took her in when she asked, hope she's doing better.
a door actually can give a black eye or a cut..
I once passed out and on the way down my eyebrow/bone hit a wall, and that gave me a terrible black eye. Its one of the highest points on the face so I could imagine a door hitting her eyebrow and give the same thing. But considering her story, its more likely that he actually did that to her.
she needs to get out asap!!
Swoozie: “so I’m a simp…”         Swoozie one video later: “so there’s a gorgeous gamer girl who likes me so I told her to go live by herself…” The lord Swoozie’s wisdom knows no bounds…
So he thought she was fine asf, liked her personality and thinks she has a big heart, to me it sounded like he found her perfect, yet because of a little clingyness he couldn't  give it a shot. I cant help but feel in an alternate universe they both could of been happier and he could of saved her from that dude whilst simultaneously being with someone he likes.
alr boys who’s the mystery girl ?
Swoozie I LOVE YOU
One brotha to anotha, lose the hat.
This feels so 2012 and I fucking Love it 😤😭
The only way that I can see a door giving her a black eye is if she did what I did once, and hit her face on the doorknob. I had bent down to pick something up, and it was dark and I had my glasses off, so I didn't see where the doorknob was at... Doorknob, meet eyeball.
Aren't you that guy from that WCG Ultimate Gamer Show??
Swoozie is just the OG
A black eye can happen if someone gets hit with a door _handle_ . But with the regular wood of the door, not as likely.
Doors can give you a black eye
Their door had a rubber fist on her side and when he kicked open the door the fist hit her, it's all coming together.
They both sound problematic.  And yes you can get a black eye from a door.
what hair
That thumb nail looked like masked green man
Lol I'm in a very toxic relationship but I have nowhere else to go. oof
a door can give you a black eye...the structure of my face is proof of that....
Know your value and add tax has to be one of best lines I’ve ever heard🤣 also I think you dropped this 👉👑
dude your videos are life changing
"Relationships should ADD to your happiness, not be the cause"   I'll remember that 👍
Many who are in a toxic relationship don’t even realize they’re in a toxic relationship until someone points it out
Get out gentleman. Especially if you are easily triggered and with a woman who knows how to push you over the edge. You can have the best intentions in life and towards other but once you let a woman tip you over a few times and you REACT, people will look how at you reacted and base your character solely off of that.  Not your pure intentions before a toxic relationships
Ayyy, I say "Question mark?" too, LOL. Toxic relationships aren't worth keeping if the toxicity isn't going anywhere, no matter what kind of relationship it is. If it's genuine toxicity, RUN. I'm lowkey a hypocrite here, but yes, know your value, know your worth!!! "And add tax", LMFAO funny but TRUE. 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
Whewwh...know your value and ADD TAX 🗣 say it for the people in the back!! (That's me. I'm people🙃)
I use to watch this guys old animations, and now thanks to cinnamontoastken I  find out he was on some shitty gaming reality tv show oof
the people who dislike this video are toxic
Is probably the door knob. Gave her the black guy
Idgaf if someone said this already in the comments but can someone please edit n remix this video for every time Swoozie says "Wow" it's actually Owen Wilson saying "Wow" please 🙏🏾 y'all know that be funny af
This guy has been on youtube since before I was born...Thats kind of crazy to think about, at least for me.
You know she’s a catfish when she is hot & single
Whoever that girl is she's probably pregnant now 😂
Always trust a man with a fedora
Biggest Gem 💎 *“No your value and add Tax”*
My name is ann.... AA-
Well in sponge bob, they make your more handsome…
I have a question swoozie   Were you, in a WCG episode like 11 years ago
Toxic themfriends
Man I can’t wait for the video where my boi winning with the women cuz damnit so much pain…
bro did you study psychology or some shit? your advice is FIRE
the black eye couldve came from the door knob too, but idk
I love that swoozie vids are rare it makes them even more persios like daimonds
If only this came out months ago when I was in my toxic relationship cuz UGH THIS WOULDVE SAVED ME SO MUCH TIME
Can you stop referring to women as females when you're telling your stories? This isn't biology class. Women are more than their reproductive systems =_= hearing you say you make friends with "dudes and females" is gross
My dad gave me a black eye with a door when I was little. My eye was the same height as the doorknob when he opened it and WHAM
Day 1 of asking” I’m new and want to learn how to animate. What do I use and how do I learn”
I wanna hear the story of you kicking this dudes ass. Please, it’s worth the hours of animation.
Wowwwww..........
Book her a 30 day airbnb
I just got out of a toxic relationship a few months ago. We we're together for a year and a half. I just couldn't handle it anymore and realized I should be treated better than that. I still don't have any regrets and happy with my decision to leave.
my brother walked by wjile i was watching this and called swoozie ne-yo
What wow 😂😂
Why does it feel like you are stuck in 2014
If someone was granting for them to let them do nice things for me, I would let them, if it was the first time and if they screw up and ask for a second trial ill jokingly think about it and say a big FAT no! Don't chase after people, if you wanna their toxic and have failed you in the past, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
I love your portion control analogy
Kills me everytime he says "wow"
Didn't even realize this but this is legit happening to my girl bsfs and I'm gonna try to do something about it
Ig the doorknob , sounds sketchy
Fly over and drop his ass
This is a follow up on a previous story give us more updates it’s like watching episodes of a series
I got a black eye as a kid one time by running in the house, turning too fast  and running face first into the corner of a wall. I can believe the door story happening, but it's obvious she's trying to cover up abuse.
don't call women females
Swoozie got the drip
Missed you, coming in with the heeeaaat
Oh I'm taking that last line!!
Is it just me or does this shot of him just looks amazing at 8:41
This girl is 0-100 at making life decisions.
it could give u a black eye
Swoozie: Snip Snip, Done.  *Damn bro I didn't know we were castrating them*  THIS IS A JOKE
😦 “Wooow” 😂💀
Bruh my bf just said he doesn’t wanna be toxic anymore…he said he watched him😭😭😭
If the door hit her on the outside bone of her eye, it can definitely swell up causing a black eye. I've had similar with the edge of a tennis racket... But she sounds like she's full of sheet and made it up to get attention.
Those lil takes of him saying stuff like wow is hilarious 😂believe me it will be such a meme
Sozzieeeeeeeeeeee it’s the boy not the doorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
You still have play me in chess yet
When you get hit above the eye, in the eyebrow bone, over days blood very slowly lowers to your eye (gravity, yeah) and you get a black eye. Since eyebrow bone is more forward, it is possible that the door hit her...
swoozie you dont look a day over 25
I got a black eye from a door before
Wow!! 30 days free rent. I wish I was a hot girl!!!!!
If she don’t watch anime not for me even if she is fine😅
This dude said MS Paint 🤣🤣🤣🤣
If a male ,or female is verbally abusive in a relationship. Cheats on you ,and then starts hitting you up when your doing better or seeing someone else. Won’t take no for an answer and won’t leave you alone even if you block them. And you get back with them only to repeat the same patterns. _Yo!!!! That’s toxic…._
Why are you calling women females?
My bf and I haven't been together for long, but I want to talk to him about the concerns I have, since he has been avoiding my texts and avoiding me in general.  I want to talk to him, but he just ignores me and flakes me. Currently I've been crying myself to sleep for 4 days in a row hoping that maybe he will message me, but so far nothing.   So a couple days ago I told him that we need to talk things through (I've told that to him at least 3 times if not more) and that communication is the key in a LDR. I also told him that he has until the end of this week to talk to me, if he doesn't, I'm gonna end my suffering and break up with him. I don't want to break up with him, but if he refuses to talk to me I have no other choice. (He has seen my messages, the only reason why I know about that is because I have seen him come online multiple times and the texts are marked as read.)
Lmao i broke my nose to a door
This is one of the most serious vids I've ever seen from you Swoozie. I appreciated/needed this; thank you. Stay fresh out there.
It's pretty weird but we get black eyes over all kinds of nose injuries. When people get nose jobs and the plastic surgeons have to break the nose, people often get both black eyes and look like raccoons! So I definitely think it's likely that a door can give someone a black eye by hitting their nose
The fact that they got married?? Even blatant verbal and physical abuse, just blows my mind
swoozie my man you have helped me through so many shitty situations and i appreciate that 😂
bro, Swoozie gives better life lessons than my parents😂
Honestly, swooz you could have let her live with you.
a door cant give you a black eye unless ur eye is at the same level as the top corner of the door. aint no way.
I feel like some guys don’t understand that you don’t need a girl friend that has to like video games
The wow is sending me
She's such a nice girl, she really deserved better.
:/
I got into one of these “relationships” with a long-time friend of mine, and I just felt like I couldn't leave. It started with control (who I can and cannot talk to),  then towards the end (threats of physical violence, near violence, and verbal abuse).  I hope that everyone that's been there is doing better, and those who are still in these situations can see the light and do better for themselves.
I wish i can be like you
She declined for 60 days? Sus
Should've told her to call the cops!
11:37 she stupid as hell I would’ve took that shit tf?!?!?! You’re making my life easier. She’s an idiot for that I’m sorry.
swoozie your a goofy man , you play to much i wish a girl like that would come at me with them intentions and HOTT and cute . Ready to be a wife and mother.  FOUR YEARS you kept the girl waiting man if i met her id mak her cut you off to my girl would not be allowed to have male friends except her family .
Swoozie dont say females 😫
So you met pokimain??
Gotta be careful when cutting dem onions bruh.
long vids are best vids
Know your value and add tax
Swoozie, can I ask? what's wrong with your left index finger?
Part 3, toxic family members?
I have a wee thing I always say and I rlly dk if it's true but it kinda makes sense in my head "love urself before you expect others to love you"  Am i correct in saying that?
Imo that sounded more than toxic, i.e. abusive.
Cough cough 11 months ago
Anyone think anne is lisha wei and her guy is Michael santana, imaqtpie
Hi
If I actually texted back I would have stories to tell💀
Actually one time I was playing some what tag in a building and my flight or fight kicked in and as I was chased I slammed the door giving the person chasing me a black eye
My girlfriend was in an emotionally abusive relationship with her ex husband and they had two kids together. He is a narcisist, manipulator, gaslighter. She was a large business owner and has all of the education to run business's, while he has nothing past high school. He was the type of person to take credit for everything that she did unless it was something that was bad. If it was bad, he would make sure she knew it. He does not care for their childern and uses them as weapons to use against her since their divorce. He was the type to say he would hurt himself if they ever broke up or got divorced. They were together for 17 years and she is the strongest person I know by far. The day the divorce happened was when he came home from fishing and my girlfriend was watching tv with the kids. He expected food to be on the table and everything to be done and he started flipping out on her. Eventually he used the "Do you even want to be married to me anymore?" Manipulation tactic. She got the guts to finally say "You know? I don't think I do anymore." That is when he started yelling at her and trying to put her down and then dragged her to see his therapist because he claims that she was insane and isn't able to think clearly. She recorded all the conversations that went on inside that room for court later on. The things that he says is absolutely awful. He claims that he is the owner of her business, even though he doesn't even do his own taxes, she does them for him. He is illiterate and he thinks he is the smartest person on the planet. Every opportunity that he had, he would put her down. An example is when she speaks for herself once during the forced therapy session saying how she is having to slave around the house, watch the kids and never allowed to leave the house because he doesn't want her to make friends and wants her to lose all her relationships in the outside world, while running a huge empire. He then goes on to say how it isn't that bad and he has it much worse. He lies in every sentence that comes from his mouth and when you call him out on it, he will do everything he can to make you think what he says is the truth. He constantly raises his voice and tries to get a rise out of you. When you tell him to stop raising his voice, he says that he is speaking calmly and then insults you and if you start raising your voice to defend yourself, he then tells you to lower your voice and says "We will carry this conversation later when you calm down" He is worse than a murderer in my opinion. He has kids, not to raise them or care for them, but to use them as ammo to bring her down. This isn't even 1% of anything I could share, but I just wanted to let people know about another type of toxic relationship. Last thing I will say is that he constantly blames her from not having the divorce finalized, while his lawyer is the one who openly admits to not having filed the papers on his behalf because he told her to delay as long as she can.
Literally perfect timing for the first ad. “K gotta go”
In animation video I can watch it for a swoozie l’ve invested so much time.
what's a xanga?
Swoozie became a therapist, It work's though.
Your the definition of “i got alot of girls in my highschool/college days
YASSSS Swoozie! "Know your value...and add tax"
Full disclosure, I've been married 16 years now, so I've got some experience under my belt.  Here's the number one way to avoid getting stuck in a toxic relationship: *_DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES SLEEP WITH ANYONE YOU'RE NOT MARRIED TO._*  I'll explain.  Sex, along w/ hugging, cuddling, breastfeeding, etc. releases a hormone called oxytocin.  Oxytocin is also known as the "bonding hormone," b/c it induces the "warm fuzzies" when it's released.  So!  If you see someone _fine_ and sleep w/ them, you get the warm fuzzies every time you do it, causing you to become more attached or *_bonded_* to them.  After the "honeymoon" phase of the relationship wears off, when you see how selfish or narcissistic or lazy or meddlesome or [insert bad personality trait here] they are, *WHOOPS,* too bad, your dumb self is already _bonded_ to this person, and even though you know _in your head_ that you should end the relationship, _in your heart_ (and your loins, let's be honest), you just "can't leave" them.  *_BUT,_* if you cool your jets, control your body instead of letting it control _you,_ it'll give you some time to get past the lovey-dovey, warm-fuzziness of a "new love" and get to see the person for who they really are, _before_ you've bonded yourself to the point that even the _thought_ of breaking up hurts.  _Don't_ follow your heart, b/c it can lead you astray.  *_Use your head,_* so you don't end up stuck in a *toxic relationship.*
Swoozie proving that he doesn't discriminate made my day XD My mom was kinda seeing this guy years back. They met because he offered her a ride home from the casino. She said no the first time, but said okay the next. He was telling me (cause I'm snoopy and ask many questions) how he had bad thoughts about her since she rejected him and how he was just trying to be a nice guy, and I'm like....'would you/have you ever offered a ride to a guy? A real nice guy would offer rides to anyone' 😪 Him trying to explain himself for the next 10 minutes was hilarious cause he knows he only hit on her cause she's a pretty lady.
Hey dude do you still play the old games still like ps3 xbox 360
Swoozie whenever you post I watch your whole channel no matter how much times I've watch the same vide
I think he did the right thing by not taking her into his house and offering to pay her rent somewhere else for 60 days. I do think he should've consulted the free services of a local domestic violence hotline to talk to a professional, because there are entire toolkits out there on talking to your friends about how to get out of abusive relationships. I think a professional could've help provide some key phrases and techniques to help Ann see how bad her situation really was. Also like if she had moved in with him she would never learn to be emotionally independent. It's so sad how much society pressures women into thinking these types of relationships are okay because a woman that doesn't have a husband is viewed as irreparably broken so women settle for the worst possible stuff sometimes.
I would greatly prefer being called someones "accountability person" to "mom friend."
male promiscuity and female promiscuity is different
This would piss me the fuck off. I HATE when someone I care about CHOOSES to be in a bad relationship or state of mind..........im the type of friend that'll just call you out like "YOU FUCKING IDIOT" I'm sorry its just tough love, what your doing is a STUPID CHOICE and ill make sure you know it stay strong swoozie
He hite her
I’m just saying I would not mind a clingy girlfriend at this point
Maybe she slightly open the door and got smacked in the face
14:07 Swoozie always be dropping that knowledge on us fools! Thanks Swoozie.
my boi trying bring back fedoras, bold move my man
I had an ex (lets call her apple) who cheated on me for 4 months with her friend (let's call her sol) out of the 9 months we were together. I was pissed cause I didn't know about it. Sol later texted me saying that what was me and Apple's relationship when I was Dating her. Sol had texted me before for other things but I was so pissed at both of them that I was just plain rude to her. I explained that it was a normal relationship, but sol responded saying their relationship turned toxic. Apple would threaten to kill herself when sol would want to take a break from their relationship, (I'm guessing mental health reasons) but Apple wouldn't want to do that; and this was all happening when Sol's house got broken into and they were on the street for some time so Sol had decided to stay with Apple. I felt bad after hearing that cause Sol wasn't really doing anything that would give me the right to be mad at her. I wish I had apologized when we were chatting about Apple. I was following apple until I had enough and I didn't want to see her stuff on my tl. She would post all kinds of sexual things, pictures of her hickeys. Just stuff like that, and I made me uncomfortable. I don't go to the same highschool that sol and apple go to, but my best friend does. They had french class together, Apple would brag about having sex with sol as much times as she could, in and out of class and my friend said it made sol very uncomfortable. I don't know if they did have sex, plus that's not my business anyways: but even if they did, sol probably wouldn't want Apple bragging about what they do in the bedroom. I really don't fuck with Apple's family anymore. But I really hope sol is doing okay. I may text her to see what she's up to and hopefully she's out of that relationship, last time I checked she took their motto (forever and always) out of her bio.
That was a great video
I’m 11 years old this video helped with my future
Thumbnail looks dope💖🙌🏿🙌🏿🔥🔥
Oh hey, swoozie, been a minute since you've been in my recommendeds. Glad you're still around, man.
anything happens: swoozie: w o w
He hit her but she doesn’t want you to get mad and fly over and beat his 👀
Yo I bet her face is flat now
This helps a lot for toxic people thanks dude
Xbox…. Nooo and here I thought you was cool swoozie lmfao PS life is only life 😂 I joke somewhat
The door can give you a black eye if you get hit with the door knob so unless she was at the same level with the door knob i don't think its possible to get a black eye from a door knob i could be wrong though.
swoozie is slowly turning into chris paul every day
Swoozie what if the doorknob hit her In the eye with force = black eye
13:33: bruh: INDDED 😂
Bro why you always put yourself down bro like you a good looking dude no cap. Like if I was gay I'd smash(that sounded weird...)
My brother got to the point where he would avoid me and our parents, just because he didn’t want to justify his friends toxic behavior. Then he and all his friends got an apartment together, and we heard basically nothing about what was going on. When we did visit, the place was in shambles.  Eventually I discovered that one of his more toxic friends had jumped the lease, leaving an animal to suffer alone in the dark closet of his old room. I told my brother that this was unacceptable, but my brother was so beaten down that he was unwilling to confront the issue. I finally had enough and delivered an ultimatum; make the friend take his pet with him, or I’m going to call animal control.   My brother had his own pet that wasn’t on the lease, and I didn’t want him to lose it. But I was willing to get him in trouble, because I refuse to tolerate animal cruelty. Do you know what happens??? Guess what toxic friend does?  He Convinced my brother that everyone in the apartment had to take their pets to the shelter to save the apartment. (THE APARTMENT THAT T.F. Already LEFT) So my brother nearly gets rid of his precious kitty before my family and I talk him down. Eventually the toxic friend did take his pet, but I wish I could’ve save that poor bunny from that monster.
Had to avoid this video for the longest cuz it hit too close to home.
Let her go
My friend went though this and I couldn't deal with her. So I broke the friendship myself, because no matter what we said, she didn't listen
I guess my boyfriend is just clingy. He says he's more important than my friends so I should give him more attention and got mad I couldn't meet up with him cuz it was my best friend's birthday, saying I'm always coming up with excuses even thou I've told him I ran errands for my parents and school keeps me busy that on free days I get exhausted and just want to rest.
if the door handle hit her though but that would most likely push her eye in the weird part is that it very unlikely to happen
What’s her Instagram
What.
Why does alot of girls with the biggest heart is toxic??????
me watching this knowing damn well i dont have a girlfriend, so i cant take advice
Only caring about looks smh
I'm sure that you just didn't know, but a lot of women consider being called "females" dehumanizing :)
wtf is xanga
14:15 dayum ma homie spittin facts🔥
“…….and add tax.”  *YESSSSSSS* 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻💯💯💯🤣💕
I smell… foul play.
From an angle a door could probably give you a black eye. But the fact that he was chasing her is literally predatory behavior and I have a hard time believing he didn't have an intention to hurt her.
I feel bad for Ann😔
Just turned 18🙌🏾so this is a really good  advice for me...thanks swooz✨🔥
Get Swoozied.
It’s crazy watching this man my whole life and seeing him evolve. You love to see it
I swear swoozie at first was my comedian guy but years later he is my therapist 😭😂
Toxic relationships can go both ways too, I was in one where we was both toxic asf
This was a fire video
“Know your value, and add tax.” Damn I like that

If shes 6fht
You don’t realize the so called “toxic dude” is actually acting like a man you acting like a female cus you listening to her problems and giving her money
The last guy who i watched with a fedora hat glad swooz ain't gone switch up on me
To this day I've never felt the touch of a woman
I like that part at the end “know ur value......and add tax”
if the door hits the side of ur face by ur eye u will get a black eye
“know your value, and add tax” too smoove
Sounds like me and my last relationship lmfaooo I even moved in with him and his parents after 2 months 🙃 I’ve been single for a year now. Turns out I’m more at peace single hehe
Someone has to tell Swoozie that we understood his bottleneck analogy, no worries man👌🏻
So I actually fell off a skateboard and i hit abve my eye right about where my eyebrow is. I got a black eye. Her getting a black eye from the door is very possible
Bruh I’m still tryna get purple iPhone damn hold on

I’ve been watching ur vids a lot and now ur back so I’m happy
The zoom in on the cartoon body 🤣🤣. “Is her left thumb bigger than her right?”
It can happen my homie gave himself a black eye when he opened my door to fast
The advice at the end about being happy before being in a relationship is amazing 👍
One thing I learned, you can’t be friends with those ppl. You can’t be affiliated with them either, cause history usually swedes your decision. Trying to be friends with a toxic ex sucks, cause you will never win. So just, stay away from them altogether. Think of yourself as one of your friends who has supported you through it all…cause you are. If any of these things happens to that friend, what advice would you give them? How hard would you fight to get them out of the toxic relationship turn friendship? And apply those solutions to yourself. I tell ppl this, never let your downfall be because of someone else, let that be your own fault. Let that be your decision to make and not the action of someone else. Cause if it’s your fault, then, all the elements are in your control, for you to manipulate to your benefit. No need to think of how ppls changes will affect your outcome. So don’t let no toxic ex’s, be the reason you can’t live a happy life, or you can’t be alone, or anything like that. Even if you don’t love yourself…respect yourself enough to find someone who will give you everything and treat you right.❤️
This man got style, charisma, simple drawing, interesting stories and absolute comedy!
sWooZie with the 2012 type of content vlogs and its awesome!
My bf is ignoring me been  4 days
Normally id question if its possible to get a black eye from a door....but this morning I forgot one of my airsoft pistols was on my blanket, tossed that mo into the air and hit myself PERFECTLY in the eye. No black eye, but anyting tis possible
as a child, i got a black eye from a door because my mom opened it when i was infront of it
Swoozie out here with the bro advice!
Awesome
I don't do clingy over the phone bc that gives me hiding cheating vibes
Really hope she gets out of this. This makes me so sad for her and worried. Hope she is doing somewhat okay
I was in a toxic relationship for about half a year. She was very controlling over everything.   She made me change the way I dressed, the music I listen to, and who I can and can't be friends with purely because "she didn't like it".  Only a week ago I got the courage to end the relationship, and it's been very hard since, because as much as she was toxic, I still love her. But she wasn't willing to change the way she treated me.
Swoozie was her Xbox name XxBoxLady? I got a text similar to that
Bro
Well... in a strange combination of movement i hit my eye with a door. So it can be real
“know your value, and add tax”
.... is that a children's bandaid on your finger?  It looks like a cartoon bandaid. No judgment just.... is it?
Super clingy after making out once?! Absolutely f***in' not. I'd run for my life.
She was gonna use Swoozie if she stayed with him for 30 days just to get over that dude.
Get her
Ur so cool one of the youtubers I wanna meet !!
Should of just told her to get tf out of there but ok
People with unresolved childhood trauma seek romantic partners that feel "familiar".
I’ve been the toxic one before and I realized eventually I was the problem and I’m working on fixing it
You should have let her come, you would be married by now.
Me showing this to my sister
Plot twist swoozie is the toxic one for not dating her when he had the chance 😂😂
Ok so once it was a homecoming dance, and pretty much my friend arranges one of the most popular girls to agree to dance with me and I'm like, WTF. The point is I get scared and hide out in the restroom but while he's trying to convince me to get out and go back to the dance, some more dudes go in the restroom and this one dumbass found out about what was going on and he decides to kick the door down so I come out. Now though the door was metal it was weak as fuck, I had to push it the entire time to make sure no one got in. So when this dumbass kicked the door and I wasn't expecting it, it hits my eye, I would've fought him but my friend whom was much stronger than me told me it wasn't worth it. The point is yes it can give you a black eye, I know from experience
Swoozie if dis girl is dis fine, talented, kind and u made out w/ her... WE GOTTA EXECUTE OPERATION SAVE ANN!!!!!!! SHE CANT SUFFER IN THAT RELATIONSHIP!!! SHE WAS CLINGY TO YOU SO SHE COULD"VE PROLLY AVOIDED HERRR FAMMM, das all im sayin doe

Thank you for the advice and is your hand 🤚 alright? It looks as if you injured your finger if so I hope it heals soon
🤣 when you're just here for the story time & he has to state the name he's using for the girl is NOT real name
bruh this a horror story damn
I love the line at the end “Know your value and add tax”
My ex would make fun of me in front of his and my friends then when we were alone he would tell me how he never means any of it but would bring it back up in a fight to make me feel bad
Fortnite  👌 👌 👌 👌 👌 👌 👌 👌 👌
Christ. That's such a good deal you gave her too. Some people need to learn the hard way, I had a friend just like this.
Your eye sockets something hitting it vertically like a door I believe with not cause a black eye it would cause maybe the laceration on the top and bottom of your eyelid and the top of your cheek, but no way that would cause a black eye
A virgin 20yo millionaire with a fedora giving advice
Swoozie most used word is “ *Wowwwww…* “
Hey Mopheus I think El Jesusito is testing your life all the time bro good thing you have a brain and cabesa to handle the situation
thanks cool fedora man
It is possible to give yourself a black eye with a door if it’s at an angle
Thanks Rachel, this is a good video
Girl: CHOOSE ME OR UR FAMILY! Me: HAH! BITCH PLEASE!  Her: •👄•
Me: I would just say yes,sure
I think Rihanna gave the best description of a toxic relationship in one of her songs. I believe the lyrics go ‘funny you’re the broken one, but I’m the only one who needed saving’ and I think it relates to the feeling of how you can’t leave and you feel like you have to help the person because the toxic person either plays the victim, actually has something wrong with them, or both. They’re broken and you’re tying to help but really, you’re the one getting hurt in the situation.
Why don't he have 10 mil subs
Swoozie, how come you make out with hundreds of girls, yet you are still single? Surely one of them had to be wifey material no? 😢
The Know your value and add tax is gold advice, more people in the world need to hear that kind of phrase
😮
helping another woman out like everyone should :]
hay swoozie it is not possible to have a door give somebody a black eye especially in this case i think that he hit her
Lmao how did u lose track 1 min into the video and go into a 5 min story about how hot some girl was, was there anything else interesting???
Bro you could rock dread locks
hey bro just confirming a door can give u a black eye it happened to me it just has to be hard enough
clingyness is definitely a big no-no for me like this one girl i was talking to started being hella clingy the day after we told each other that we liked each other and it was a huge turn off
I think I know exactly who this girl is
Swoozie hit the nail with the hammer on this video and I’m only 2:17 minutes in 😂😂😤😤
can u respond
If you get together with "Ann", you need to tell a movie director or some kind of publisher your story. That's Oscar material... or the next big romance novel.
yeaaaaaa let’s stop referring to women as “females”
I'm going to be single forever but I'm going to take notes.
Jesus loves you
It isn’t possible for a door to give you a black eye I’ve been physically hit with a door in the eye but it made it bleed quite a bit
Seems like you missed out! She seems like a grest person. Some people just need someone.
Say it with me now, YOU CAN'T HELP EVERYONE! If you are in a toxic relationship or know someone in one, you sometimes have to accept you can't help or change them. It sucks and you really care for that person but you got to take care of yourself too!
That’s a nice ass camera swoozie
You should pull up to Ann’s boyfriends house and loud the clip into him
That advice at the end ? Yeah. That's why Swoozie is the king. *GOLD IN BARS.* Amen to that.
My ex was and did all these things. Im so happy hes gone
not club penguin 😂😂😂
You should have said yes to her living with ya smh
The animation quality went WAY down
I've given myself  several  black eyes with doors
WOW
That fuckin hat is D A P P E R  as fuck my guy
Swoozie, I love you, man, but you gotta lose that hat. Makes you look like a major douche.
the corner of the door coud have hit her eye bro
Honestly, i thought you knew this chick. Plus, your attachment style doesn’t match hers. There is book called attached. I think you should read it. But yea this dude is toxic.
Can’t help someone who doesn’t want to be helped. We sure she was not the toxic one?
I like that toxic song refrence!
How is this man's clothes always on point?
Rachel LOL
There’s also that bf/gf that always cancels on stuff at the last minute which makes you feel unwanted and lonely which honestly leads me and anyone else in that situation to look for other options but never pull thru bc we’re hoping for that person to be able to get their shit together and not always be canceling
he got a funky hat
Ily
eh it depends on if the door hit your nose or not
I say yessssssssssssssssssssssssssss
I gave my cousin a black eye by hitting her with a door. If the door knob hit her in the eye, that would explain it.    The story is that we were playing a game, where my dad was chasing us, and I hid in my room, I heard a knock on the door, and I, assuming it was My cousin, threw the door open. She happened to be doorknob height and was just standing at the location in which she gets smacked by a doorknob.
"Know your value, and some tax"   Fuck yes. KING.
I met you on Xbox lol, good old DOA4 days 😎
11:19 Brah I️ literary had the same idea XD
I love your videous but i think coloured animations are beter
The accountability of his animation is….. YOIKES
I’m here to see any comments mentioned PUA
know your value, and add tax. wow.
Listen to me when I say, that door did not hit her no door has the capacity or strength no matter how hard you shove the door to give somebody else a black eye, he had to of hit her pretty hard and she’s covering it up
I remember a story my dad told me about his sister. Years ago (maybe like 25 ago idk) one of my dad’s sisters (we’ll call her Beth) “Beth” was in a abusive relationship with her husband “Dan”. My dad said she left this dude so many times but always went back to him and even got married for whatever reason.  So one day when Dan went to work, my dad and my GP (Grandpa for short) drove a moving trailer/truck to Beth’s home and they spent the entire day packing up the whole house, and they rushed this too to be gone before Dan got home. Like Dan had zero clue what was going on and came home to basically an empty house.  They then drove back to my GP’s state and let Beth live with them for the time being and because they’re family. They told her basically to NOT contact this guy at all in anyway shape or form and that they didn’t move her states over to get away from him for no reason, she asked them for the help in the first place.  About like two weeks later,  guess who shows up at GP’s house? Yep. It’s Dan. Beth somehow managed to contact him and told him to come get her so that they can “work it out”. My dad was beyond pissed because he helped his sister literally empty a house, move states, and did everything to protect her but then she just throws herself back in the same situation.  I think the only way she managed to get away from him years later was because he actually Left Her due to him been having an affair, but yeah my dad would tell me “people will always crawl back to those that hurt them, and there’s almost no way of stopping it. You need to see the red flags/point them out when you see them in the beginning, before it gets to deep and you’re raveled tightly in them”  Yeah it’s hard to see people you care about staying with somebody or is toxic/abusive in anyway, but sometimes there is really nothing you can do because it’s up the person themselves if they really want help or not.
Moral of the story: all girls should just date Swoozie.
My ex was toxic af everything that was said perfectly embodied the relationship I was in
That girlfriend is lying
How do dudes cheat on a cute girl. And how she not going date you? You have money, chill, and a good person
I’m pretty sure if you hit your nose at a certain angle it can give you a black eye
YOU EXPLAINED THE AQUA PANNE ANALOGY PERFECTLY DONT EVEN SWEAT BRO
I think the same from gamer girls. I like how we think alike
the woooooow
Mans really said Microsoft paint 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
I'm the same way
Thanks bruh I was going through it and ur advice helped
O
How tall is this girl i’m asking for like the door head
yes
It's me or swoozie play himself ?  She could have let Anne live with her for the "30 " days and once che is with him let her know about u paying for the first moths
They might get divorced no 🧢
wtf youtube algorithm, why did it take so long for me the find this
Swoozie! I've been watching you since your OG dayzz (10 years +). I love to pop on in your channel every once in a while and see what's new with you and I never get disappointed! Hearing about your situationships through your storytelling/animation is so clever and fresh. However comma I'm so confused as to why you're still single because clearly these girls out here are not it, lol! You'll find the right one for you soon enough ;)
damn
The gamer community is NOT 90% dudes. Spreading that stereotype in combination with the toxicity women receive when gaming is exactly why girls pretend to be guys on games or don't play at all.
Sounds like she’s dating my ex
Swoozie: this girl… Me: was FINE  Swoozie: was FINE
"a few months ago" you mean an entire year ago?
How you cheat on a girl with a fine body AND she’s a gamer girl tf

"Know your value, and add tax"  -Swoozie 2021
He just described the typical decisions girls make
… I feel like she may have lied to you about literally everything… or I’m probably wrong who knows
Daaaaanngg dude
YES Adande. Say it louder for the people in the back! <3
It's the "Wow" for me
what kind of dude cheats on a girl who plays league tournaments and is a baddie like wtf
I had to be the six hundredth and sixty sixth person to view this
Quote of the year "Know your value!...and add TAXES!" - Swoozie
It sounds like she’s a child’s in a woman’s body. Seriously.   This is the type of broad that’s a liability... Be careful with that one
I have a bitch brother in a toxic relationship and don't get me wrong he wouldn't be called one if he would just break up with her. He was sent to jail multiple times bc of her bc he wouldn't come home instead of hanging with family 😤 but he still goes back!
Should’ve just let her crash at ur place for a month, just saying that’s kinda on u
Well Probably the side of her eye
Did she become an asian daughter in law, like what are you doing at his parents house!!!
in Jamaica she is or would be called yamhead
If a hot gamer girl made out with me and got clingy, sounds good
I guess I dont need a therapist anymore swoozie got me
Club penguin 😭
This was the best video
Depends on what is on the bathroom side of the door.
Real toxic relationship signs:  You or your boy/girlfriend melting
Mans took the biggest L in 2021
Swoozie taught me more in this video, than a whole day at school 🐐
Shoot, I’m two days later
I absolutely love swoozie but I wish men would stop calling us “females”. Just call us women instead of an adjective that could describe a dog
if she aint toxic or abusive bro ion want her🤷🏽‍♂️😭
Your response to everything she got going on is everything lol
If she had said door knob it would be more believable.
You know the manz is cool and had smooth flirting skills when he wears a fedora 😎
Swoozie, from years of hearing your stories, you’re kinda lame lol, many women have thrown themselves at you,, shown interest and you fumble the bag.every.time 🥴
"Know your value and add tax," man, that hit hard.
Thrice
Are u talking about pro csgo player beNITA?
Swoozie: Wow I don't know why but i instantly thought of Owen Wilson
“know your value” PREEEEAAAAAACCCHHHHH 🙌🙌🙌🙌 love the videos, cool fedora 😎
Swooosh is back real fans would know the name swoosh
are you still a virgin?
Lol if she’s super short the handle coulda hit her eye I’m not sure swoozie
Ooh i’ve seen those before those messages on Xbox and how they are a bot
That's more than toxic- That's straight abuse :/
She's a liar..
None of that from you
Stop it
Take off that fedora rn
Nice hat.
I just got out of a relationship where this guy would threaten to kill himself on a day to day bases. Especially if I wasnt around him 24/7. I'm a nurse and he got mad at me bc I work to much....he back handed called me names saying "ofcourse youd do this to me" "ofcourse the only person who so called loved me would be the person who cant make time for me" it was awful. And I left. I broke up with him. He even said if you leave me I'll kill myself. And I still left. And never gone back.
8:01 so you are a love guru...ay?(y m i still single?)
13:32 hold hold hold up hold up hold up They just got married(queue the oh no meme music) 😱😱
11:59 girl used your brain life is like chess 🤦‍♂️
few months ago for sWooZie is 11 months 😂
10:43 proof live is a game of chess the more you know
10:13 girl do not lie to me never be a dirty dish in the sink. This girl said never that big cap just 10:04
I love how Swoozie just sees a hot girl who is into gaming and is kind, and he goes, "We are definitely having kids".
Swoozies wow should be a meme 10:04 😂😂 👌
Even if it was the door, he did it by kicking the door she was trying to shut because if him, its him. 100%
Yeah I think  a door can  give you a  black eye if you can drown a duck 🦆8:56
I don't know why that girl thought she didn't deserve better, but that feeling that you can't leave once you get started is very common.
Swoozie, if a door hits someone i am pretty sure the whole side of the face that got hit is getting bruised.
Man said club penguin 6:17
Hold up let me Google if a door can get you a black eye
Maybe it was the handle??
Currently trying to get with a girl who I am really clicking with and we have great chemistry.  The only thing is she’s supposedly toxic, but i haven’t seen any signs of that with her... yet.
hi
Woooooow
Anything can give you a black eye if it hits just right ahaha
This dude brings to each video some very wise vibes that I like, thanks for the advice Swoozie, keep up the good content
Girls that have all their points in Charisma, Personality, Cool Gamer girl factor: have 1 or 2 pts in common sense and relationship-intelligence.
Not the CP (Club Penguin)
Anne is definitely a cancer ♋️
I bet whoever dislikes the video is toxic, or clicked it by accident
I was playing baseball with my four nephews, I was pitching and my nephew hit the ball into the bridge of my nose and I had two black eyes!😵 It was actually a damn good hit for seven-year-old though, I was proud of him.😏
Yes it can a door can give you a black eye😱😱😍
Swooze you missed big time bro, you should’ve just stayed with a clingy girl cuz now she has a shit life, and if you ain’t cappin bout her than I think she’s good on the crazy hot scale
"Know your value and add tax"    I don't respect anyone that puts their hands on their significant other..... toxic people are horrible
It can I was playing with my mom once and I was chasing a round the house and she didn’t realize that I was right by your door I ran right after she close the door I didn’t realize it went straight to the door give me a big blackeye
I didn't realize I was in a toxic relationship with someone until she broke up with me. She started all overly nice and then she got real cold and worsened my ptsd. Always felt like I was walking on eggshells and she took advantage of my feelings and fear of abandonment.
A door is very much capable of giving you a black eye. I threw a door into my brothers face once and his shit was bruised all the way up
this is funny, educational, and funny, you have my submarine
Oh wait, he's trini??
Hey, I really love your videos and you always make me laugh! I am not sure you will even see this but could you stop referring to women as "females?" Using 'female' strips women of their value. It communicates the idea that the woman's sole purpose is reproduction. Female’ can apply to any species, while ‘woman’ refers specifically to humans.
Swoozie a real one. 🥺❤️
It can realy fast
Is Swoozie a nice guy wats with the fedora
🐐
I love your content and all but it’s different when your married not bf and gf
Dude that situation sucks hat
I was kinda hoping he'd throw the bottle behind him at the wall and be like "FORGET THE ANALOGY"
I hope your finger feels better and recovers
I had a toxic boyfriend in the past and it was horrible. Nothing I did or say was never good enough. Then he got physical.
It’s rare, but yes, you can get a black eye from a door. Being a dumbass, I have a several from different door corners.
Ann is pokemane
Cool Video, Rachel
He gave her a black line
ngl u took an L
Ain't no way this video was filmed in 2021...why is he wearing 2015 clothes?
The dude sounds demanding, she is just so very stupid and I wouldn’t get in that situation I would let her be tbh. These are so insane relationship stories are just…idk anymore😂😂😂😩😩
i felt that "bruh"
Yo I play Xbox too hope you could friend me Uncoolgnome68
*When the video longer than my will to live*
Wait the door knob maybe ? Can give a black eye
"know your value, and add tax"
I got a black eye in reception when an adult slammed a door and the corner hit my eye, not sure if that changes anything though
waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaait a minute... that door "story" sounds like the Amber heard VS Johnny Depp story 😂🤣😂 yeaah that "Ann' is lying your honor
She declined 2months of free rent,     HOWWWWWWWWW?!?!??!?!
I got a black eye from a door once, sooo yes its possible
my current relationship used to be toxic, rn things are fine but i feel like i have to be careful at many things. also i feel scared that if shits go toxic once again i will find it hard to do anything about it
A door can give you a black eye my dad got one after running into a door BTW good vid love your story’s 😃
Ight swoozie I won’t say anything but fr fr is it valkrae Ik it is like just context clues her names Rachel u said it at the end of the video throw us off and you said the she got married thing to throw us off like fr u can secretly tell me or sum
Like even the context clues Rachel, her first name
Swoooize your not slick bro Ik it’s valkyrae I love you man just admit it
Swoozie, I love you bro but you ain’t gotta reinforce that stereotype that 90% of gamers are dudes. Kinda hurts cuz that’s just not true anymore :(
"know your value and add tax" lol
Relationships like this are so weird. Can't relate.
So like… why didn’t you try harder with her? I get that she came on strong and clingy but you’d been friends for YEARS. 😒 I don’t know, if I was her I’d consider that a rejection and just stay away from you. Like if you know me that well and still don’t want to work on a relationship that you obviously aren’t that into it.
Hmmm weird how after not watching swoozie for a min youtube puts this in my recommended after I start talking to my ex again…
doornob
When i was small like 11 yrs old i was coming out of a room and my mother comes in slamming the door in my face causing the area around it to blacken. the thing is that our cheeks are soft but the area around our eyes is a little less soft so the door may hit ur entire face but most damage will be caused near ur eye
8:54 yeah that sounds way off. My friend got smacked by a door once and he had a mark on his cheek and forhead right over his eye. His eye was completely untouched.
Swoozz always lookin fresh 👏👏
Swoozie... there was a kid at my school that got knocked out and destroyed by a door. He had to go home cause of a door and got a blackeye from a door.
Your not subbed to swoozie yet 8:40
Honestly couldn’t have said it better my self swoozie many people can learn from this video and let me tell ya I sure learned even more thanks to you
My boyfriend got caught cheating today and we got into a fight and left me to walk 5-7 miles home with a dead phone.
Maybe the doorknob gave her a black eye
Yuuuup, that girl Anne has an anxious attachment style that she didn’t get help for before going into a relationship. That’s just really sad.   That’s actually why I avoid relationships, gotta work on myself first before getting trapped in a bad situation.
Honestly....any girl that is this reckless is equality toxic. Society molds people like that unfortunately. They don't know they are toxic either.
I once danced into a wall and got a black eye
hi sWooZie yes you can get a black eye from a door
If my girlfriend if I ever get 11 day ever discussing how she had a dream where I cheated on her I’ll be like if you break up with me there’s a 500% chance out of 100% that you will find someone way better than me out there because I am very toxic in my opinion even though I follow everybody back on Instagram and a lot of nice things I do but I do not like the nice things I do so ignore them and only look about the negatives of myself because I’m a piece of crap
“She has a huge heart she loves to give” 😂 yea I know

A lot of people have trauma that they need to overcome before stepping foot in another relationship. Bc that translates to the next relationship with them being the toxic one and not even realizing that they are the problem. Don’t try to be that person who deals with the toxicity while trying to heal them. It will literally drain you. Like Swoozie said get happy before you step foot in another relationship
This story just sounds like what I used to go through which is codependency not talkin smack just Playing devil's advocate here girl was talking to you for like four years before she finally got to meet you pretty sure a lot of people would be pretty excited to finally meet and do everything they want to do. stepping back like that might not have not been the best play just talk to her for a second let her know what's up also know what it feels like to talk to a friend who doesn't get the hint that there in a f*****-up relationship and they keep crawling back to the same person doing the same thing regardless of how much they complain and hate it like you said they're adults keep it up man things will be alright and to everyone else going through similar situations support your friends how you can if you're recognized toxicity in your relationship it's honestly better just cut the cord saves you a lot more heartache and down the line you won't have to get a restraining order against your ex-fiance like I had to
My boyfriends brother is in a toxic relationship. The girlfriend started a rumor the family does cocaine, (so now his family doesn't want anything to do with her) she got my boyfriends dad fired, she said she has cancer and is going to die in 10 years, texts his ex pretending to be him, stalked him on a boys trip, has control of his social media, she told his friends that he beats her (so now none of his friends talk to him).And yes, he says he is going to marry her and get her pregnant.  There is nothing we can do for people that won't listen to us, but watch them crash and burn and learn the hard way. Because in these kinds of relationship, both are at fault.
Girl: You either pick me, or your family. Swoozie: Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
Swoozie's best video yet.
killing stalking shows the most toxic relationship i read
Xanga is ooollllldddddd
No you can't get a black eye from a door
how many years ago did this story happen
Amogus
Great vid but what happened to your finger my guy
Wawwwwww😭
I think if you still are able to contact her to ask her is everything alright and to let her know if anything that you are there for her because it sounds like she still is in a toxic relationship and she probably feels and believes that this is love and that he can change...just make sure that she doesn't forget how much she is worth because she is worthy
When people say "if you leave you won't find anyone like me" well thats the reason I'm leaving cause cause I Don't want to be with someone with you.
Unless your eye hit the corner of the door, idk how that works
amazing
I'm just always waiting at the end of a video for Swooz to say "And that's how I met my wife"
A doorknob
Hitting your cheek right under your eye can cause a black eye
Yo what’s funny about my experience of having a friend in a toxic relationship was that I was also trapped in a toxic relationship and wouldn’t take my own advice 😭🤡
Preach! 🙌
YES
In my house we have this door that is always very stuck it never opens smoothly and one day I was mad and just wasn't paying attention so I yanked that door so hard my hand let go of the doorknob and the side of the door smacked me square in the eye the entire right side of my safe was bruised and puffy for like a week straight
New videos dropped by SWooZie:   😌✋ 😎🙏 🖤✨  The whole YouTube community:  *Micheal Bay Explosion in the background*
@sWooZie if you ever decide to retire from YouTube you should really consider being a life coach. You give incredible interpersonal advice.
Love you man, been watching your vids since like 2010 and always quality content 👌🏻
You don’t know stupidity until you hear about your female friend’s love life 😭😂
10:33 call me Danny Phantom cause IM GOING GHOST. She’s a nester bro
Doors can give you a black eye,    Learned from experience.     Yes, I’m an idiot,
Swoozie...sometimes you speak nothing but the truth! :)
Wow I have never seen a man that does the ‘texting a friend the persons name as a safety measure thing’ before
“Know your value, and add tax”
💔♥️
Aqua Panna analogy 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
Hey swoozie, what kinda of platform bed is that? That from ikea??
“Get out” “Word wow” had me rolling😭😭😭
Yes, you can get a black eye with the door.  I’m one of them people lol
I’m gonna watch this everyday to get it through my thick head, thanks
she might of hit her eye on the door nob and got that black eye
Where was this video at last year
Know your value,and add tax…wow
I’ve been watching since the Caribbean stories and doa in the background bro I love you 🤞🏽
Took me 1 year and 3 months to remember what I deserve. Here's my advice, don't wait until you have 10,000 red flags. If it doesn't work it doesn't work. If you think you deserve better you do.
Homeboy is dressed like Joe Gardener from the movie Soul.
The thing I like about swoozie is that he gon always keep it 💯
Thanks buddy, I really needed to hear that, I helped me a lot
U and sssniperwolf needa collab
Dude you could have saved her and helped her get back on her feet.
We in the same Situation
"flow control" might work better with the bottle analogy and will have more sticking power in the mind.
I don't even hang around people who are in toxic relationships
My bf and i just broke up for the...fourth? Time. I told him as a reward for getting my learners permit (im 26, hes 38) that for my reward i want him to let the past go. I blocked people for him, i dont talk to guys cuz of him, i offered to change my phone number just to prove i wont have any opportunity to talk to my exes or friends. I tried so hard to prove he could trust me. But he, who is married and has cheated on his wife multiple times not just with me, refuses to let the past go and held it over my head. He is so bad for my health, i knew that. Last time we broke up i didnt talk to him for a month. Then he pops in at work(we work at the same place, hes prn) and i txt him and the cycle started all over again, leading to right now. He can have other women but i cant talk to any guy as just a friend. I hate that im in this situation cause i know i deserve better.
Thx I needed this video
Speak it! That's a great lesson to learn  The earlier the better. I've only recently learned this last year and I'm very glad. I'm 24 now but wish I could've learned it even earlier but all there is is to move forward and get better. Enjoyed the video and have a nice day everyone!
Bruh, this story is craazzyy, well worth the wait lol I'm sitting here going "Wooooow" with you too.
Swoozie you trippin should have wifed smh 🤦🏾‍♂️
Usually I don't listen to anyone in a Fedora, but maybe this is an exception
Let's say he didn't lay his hands on her, sure. But he damn chased her around the place and kicked the door. That's already a sign of domestic violence. It won't be a surprise if he eventually uses his hands. I hope she will be safe.
Sooner or later they are gonna have kids, then begin to hate echother. Then the kids are gonna have to live with  divorced parents, which just isn't fair.
Toxic relationships suck. And I am in one.  “Getting out” is easier said than done.
Friend who would make good bf gives you a 2 month FREE!!! apartment that's option 1 option 2 mean dick face who cheated on you and gave you a black eye and makes you live in room and not have any friends what you pick
Doors give you black eye
Sounds like ssniper……🧐
Are they still having the one month free in a apt in la I have to know now lol
Portion control… love the analogy
Loving the lavender phone 😌
Plot twist: Corinna Kopf
i swear swoozie has the most interesting life ever
You always give good advice you should post more I take your advice every time I watch your videos and bows my life is in a better place Bc of your videos
Swoozie quote: "Know your worth, and add tax"
Swooz I love u to death dog but this fit is just not it
My gf called me curses, and loves her anime characters more than me, we broke up.
Yeahhhh that, Say it again man!
I am hungry
"Portion control" Absolutely amazing analogy.
Can you stop calling us females? We are women.
Woooow.
as a gamer girl I'm offended XD I'm not a dude name bob
No one ever likes my comments so can we get to 10 likes plz?
Really good explanations, trying to find happiness within oneself is harder than it seems. Maybe you can do video explaining how you tackle this issues. It would be really helpful just to have an insight.
The door knob
I think you made her go, because of your subconscious walls you have up. I think you should've tried to see where it goes with her and Maybe this video would've been a better one 😅
Sssniperwolf
yo
*dm's swoozie on xbox* Edit: i actually did dm swoozie on xbox 360 like 10 years ago now and he actually replied. lol
Can we just take a moment. Swoozie. Did you get a new camera. Because oh my god because I can literally see so much detail in your eyes
9:00 might've been leaning or sitting against the door, having the knob hit her face
You wrong bout the door swooz. The exact same scenario happened with my mom and stepdad (he got arrested)
When I heard the door gave her a black eye the only thing that I heard in my head was "that shit don't even make no fucking sense"
Swoozie how you get so many girls😭 wtf man
Is there really nothing someone can do as a friend?  This is a genuine question btw, I’ve never been put in a situation like this but I can’t imagine just letting it be because they’re an adult.
Know your worth...and add tax.  Love it.
Toxic relationship be fire tho, pu**y hit completely different
For the whole black eye thing, if you're standing with your head tilted toward the end of door where it opens (like at the doorknob end), I could see it hitting your head in an awkward position where a bruise there could manifest. It's not hard to visualize, given the situation where she's frantically running away from him as you described.
bro why this come up with my first fight with my girl
I understand wanting to help friends out of a toxic relationship and I have learned the hard way how it can backfire on you. I went through this with a person who was my best friend. She had just had her first baby so my husband and I went down to stay with her and her husband to help out, at her and her husbands request. His parents were always toxic and they started crap with her and her husband all the time but even more after she became pregnant and the baby was born. One night her and her husband got into a fight and he threatened to shove his handgun down her throat and pull the trigger and then kill the baby and himself.  I learned that while she was pregnant his aggression had been getting worse because his parents were hounding him nonstop about moving in with them and they will never get to see their granddaughter and so on. He later said he told her that he would kill her because of all the stress he was under with his parents constantly at his throat about the baby and his wife and their threats to take his daughter away from him. They hated his wife from them moment he met her and accused her of so much bs and always caused issues in their relationship (to the point they refused to go to his wedding). At one point they tried to get me to date their son instead of her and whenever I came around they retreated me like their daughter-in-law and treated her like she as a stranger intruding in their family.  We got her and the baby out of the house and got the police involved and moved her to the town we were living in. A month later she went back to him. After she left our house she stopped talking to me. All of our mutual friends came at me because she told them I lied about the whole ting to get her baby from her (I am going through fertility issues). Her husband didn't do anything and he is the sweetest man around (even though he admitted to the police to doing it handed over his gun and they put him in jail for a month), and that I was trying to ruin her life and her relationship. She had been my best friend since elementary school and we were always more like sisters. A lot of people believed her and I lost a lot of people I had called friends at one point. Some saw the truth after the fact but I keep all of them at arms length now because if they can turn on you so fast they never really were your friends.
My heart broke when you said they got married :( i hope she gets out one day
This story is so relevant and relatable  to me. Wow... man I hope you find a way to help her one day or something.  Good video, great story,  I feel for you and I'm sorry to hear your pain. Hope you feel better soon.
You offered dis girl a free home.  IN LA!?!?!?! OKAY ZADDY!!!!!!  Where is the line? ima stand in it.
:15 backstabbed?
Just wanna say I did get a blackeye from a door. But I tripped and pushed a pull door so the doorknob gave me the black eye technically.
"know your price and add tax" I'm using that
That’s why I have 5 back ups to take her place if shit goes down, to beat your enemy you must sometimes become them
I mean if Ann was at eye level with the door knob maybe but still sus
8:49 you just answered your own question she isn't human
It could of been door handle ????? But Idk 🤷‍♂️
A door can’t give you a black eye it’s not possible if she is still with him you need to help her please
Abusive and manipulative are the words you're looking for to describe these relationships. Toxic doesn't nearly describe how harmful these people are.
Gotta love how once a Swoozie finds a potential lover his first thought is “let’s wife her”
Lol RIP Club Penguin
Swooze, how tf r u so smart
*Ann: He cheated on me*  *Me: Sips Tea: This boy ain’t loyal….*
You have nice DRIP 🔥🥶🔥🥶🥶🥶🔥
Swoozie: telling a story about a toxic relationship   Ad: IN THE HIGHEST
"know your value and add tax" *claps*
I hope one day I’m scrolling through Instagram and see a quote “When Swoozie once said, Relationships should add to your happiness not be the reason for your happiness.” “I felt that”
love your videos💖👏
maybe the door handle hit her in the eye
Maybe the doorknob ?
Bro is harem protagonist full stop
let's like that swoozie animates and draws really
Fist shaped doors be kinda scary
Yeah one of my family members got in the same thing
Yeah I know it’s bad one of my family members are doing that
Doors CAN give you black eyes by hitting you on one side of the nose because skin around the eyes is very vascular and can absorb the shock coming from the nose.  Same for if you slap someone's cheek super hard. Sincerely, a professional dominatrix who has been trained not to leave physical bruising.
Been in this same exact situation 😯
“Relationships should add to your happiness, not be your happiness.” Actually some really good advice swooz, thanks :).
I just had something like this a couple of months ago.  Was telling her on how her not respecting some of my boundaries, and wanting me to be with her 24/7(even to the point to where she wanted me to drop whatever I am doing like work, family, etc, to go spend time with her because her friends didn't show for her girls night for example), and other things are becoming a bit of a problem.  Her reaction?  She says she understood and then the next day became cold and stone faced.  She also then cheated on me, though I found out around the same time that she was already flirting with another guy for a couple of weeks and was already cheating on me while making all our friends think we were still together.  She would deny the cheating for another week or two before I said it was done and showed her a picture a friend showed me of her and the other guy(EVEN then she denied it).. but after the breakup she then admitted to it but tried to twist to where she was the victim and that I should apologize.
The vid isn't getting recommended or pushed to subs :(
Actually it can happen for a door to give you a black eye. Its happen to me long story short to be funny my brother hit me with the door
I have had the blood from a hit to the forehead slowly pool down to the eye socket giving me a black eye the day after I hit my head. It wasn’t from a door but I can imagine the same happening from that.

I like how swooz always thinks he isnt cute. Like dude I am sure they all be knockin on your door.
It 100 percent can be a door
I assure you, a door can give you a black-eye. I'm clumsy to the point that people have asked if I'm being a*used, nope, just a very stoppable force meeting an unmovable object.
He saying he play chess but he just fumbled the bag.
Swoozie, my man... I get why you let this one go (although i don't think you should have) but with your wisdom you've picked up through the years, you should be wifed up, and be working things out with none other than that perfect 10 in your life. I ain't want you to be 60 giving out these same stories fam, you got the potential to be in your 60s with a beautiful awesome family. I love your content, but your live mean more than a few good videos imo. I can't wait for the video you post of you wifing up THE one, just remember fate has many fish in the sea for you, you just have to be willing to go fishing, and commit.
Thanks for the new video, Rachel.
Thank you for all the advice you give me and everybody in the world. Great video
Wat happened to ur finger?

Frrr to clingy=crazy scary
9:55 Can someone GIF this 'get out' part

You described pouring our hearts with the bottle so perfectly. Also felt like I was living a life experience equal to yours. That deal would be a deal come true for me. Help get on back on feet. AND SHE DECLINED?! wow. Relationships add to happiness are not the reason for Know your value

A door gave me a black eye but that was because I sneezed and slammed my head into the door at an angle.
I’m a new fan watch 100s of vids of u and have been waiting for a new vid for so long
✊🏽 . The end … 😂 .
I have a friend who is in this exact type of situation and I was reminded of her with everything you said.
“Know your value... and add tax.”                                                        — sWooZie, 2021
This one has me thinking a lot. Thank you swoozie
That bruh reaction 😂
I'm sure there's a youtube/algo reason why you're saying toxic and not abusive. but sounds like Anne is in an abusive relationship, one where she was most likely manipulated and emotionally (maybe even physically) abused and now she's stuck. Of course, I can't know for sure, but I think it's important to recognize that distinction if it applies
Change your name to sWiseZie
By the sounds of this story and all the crap I've not just been through and watched, it sounds like she's also a liar. She of been trying to con her way into your life and when that didn't work out, she 'settled' with the guy she was with, more than likely lying about the 'abuse' and stuff. Sadly though, if any of it was REMOTELY true, she herself is pretty damn toxic for trying to bring a friend into a situation, more so to choose to stay in a bad position knowing full well how it was going down.  Stay smart, my man! Doing great~
Wait whatt.? LA you get apartment month for free? No way. Shit imma about to move to LA. I got a career so im good to get a job asap. N start my life there.
sWooZie what's up with the bandage
Doors can’t give you black eyes they can only hurt you badly, But you can get it from people definitely from people, But it also depends on how strong that person that did it is
Bro y most of this story I was like yb in that video (you stupid b***h)😂😂😂😂
Are u gay?
help swoozie i was toxic to my fwb and now he doesn't want me back :,( rip
Never been in a relationship.  No problems, I guess.
“Know your value...and add tax”  I like it 😏
Yes a door can give you a black eye if you have the right angle
I'm one of those actually really clumsy people who trip over there feet standing still and one day I was walking down a hall in a friends house, slipped, fell on my face and got a black eye. So it is possible to get black eyes from random things
Toxic relationships suck when you’re the observer. I don’t take shit from no one, so I’ve never been in a relationship like that myself, but I have tried to help family and friends if I see something wrong.   There was one case where my friend didn’t listen to me and didn’t see the issues in her relationship with her boyfriend, so I told her I’d still be there for her. When he came to stay at her place, she suddenly started to see all the things I pointed out and dumped him a week later. She couldn’t stand him after that live-in experience and she moved on :) So, morale of the story: be there for your friend and tell them if you sense something wrong. Even if your friend doesn’t see it at the time, hopefully through some miracle, they’ll come to the realization themselves.   What you did Swooze was very kind and generous, and I hope your friend is doing better and I hope her husband is also a better person. Btw doors can give you a black eye. I got one by accident when my mom was opening a door and it hit my face 😂
So I was in a relationship for 2 years and back in November of last year she cheated and like a dummy I took her back. I took a weekend off for our 2 year anniversary and she decided to work it after telling me she was gonna take it off. Anytime I had an issue or a problem I would try to talk to her about it and she wouldn’t wanna fix anything. It was always like that. But it was my first actual relationship so I didn’t know what to do or anything. Needless to say I broke up with her because she wanted another guy who she liked for years to talk to her. Woke her up at 130 am and moved out of her house and broke Up with her.  You can be blind to toxic people when you’re in a relationship with them. I broke up with her and I felt so relieved I did. I felt happy for once. I met this girl whose just amazing. We play the game together all the time and we both love Detroit sports. I don’t know what I did to deserve her but man. Anyone whose in a toxic relationship just know there’s gonna be someone better whose gonna treat you the same way you want to be treated.
Acqua Panna is the best water, got it.
My dude I love your content been watching you since sixth grade and I am now going to college keep it up my dude
Oh yeah fedoras are back lol  I love that bottle analogy that’s really good
A door probably could give you a black eye. Never seen it happen but I would expect it may be able to
Great video
People:I have  a toxic relationship!  Siblings:that's not toxic it's just a daily thing that we do
Bro this my mom
Sending this video to my sister….👀👀
i feel like a door could give you a black eye if you get hit with the long edge of the door where the handle is and not on the flat wooden part but I could be wrong
Swoozie love you man. But I'd  ask to call women "women" rather than females. It's  deragotary
Yo you wanna buy me a free apartment 😂😂😂
My man said Hardcore Parkour lol
Woooooooooooow this story is TOO crazy
Noooooo they got married 💀💀
My brother actually did the same thing and gave me a black eye lol
I am actually learning a lot from his experience thanks.
These three ideas are all I got   1. She's possibly lying  2. She's covering for him (something worse could have happened which could get serious, but she doesn't want to get him in trouble) 3. The angle that she was standing at after closing the door, could have set it up where when he kicked it , the door slammed into her eye ( the door mostly likely slashed into the side of her face, close or even on her eye) .
Hmm I kinda feel like swoozie is flo rida but from an alternate dimension 😑
He do be kinda drippy tho
i'm loving the fedora but yeah this story she should just leave cause that doesn't sound correct
I dont want kids but my boyfriend dous... S N I P   S N I P   D O N E
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
The bottle analogy was actually pretty solid, that was clever!
What is toxic in this relationship?
I don’t even know who you are, but “know your value and add tax” is one for the books. Thanks for the video
We call it beerio kart
Holy motherfliping crap, now I’m sad  Solid video, I keep telling my friends who are in one-month-lasting relationships deal with you first so you can find your person, swooz you spoke to my heart-Im sorry this girl didn’t work out, but I hope shes safe
This man sold the bag, he coulda piped. I’m disappointed in you Swoozie
Feels like she is also a toxic one
And you’re still celibate right? I love that about you, it’s very admirable especially in 2021. Lol
13:30
I wanna be like swoozie...                                    Good at Chess
She could of gotten a black eye from the door hitting her nose.
A door knob can, i got one when i was in kindergarden
That headboard is like a window and i low key like it
The bottle "Panna" Swoozie shows means to F*** in Finnish. 😳
I want more videos 😭
My man out here preaching 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾. God I love waiting for your videos when they come out, I swear #1 YouTuber and continues to be my favorite youtuber
so we finna ignore how swoozie literally lives like an anime main character
God gave you that women so you can get married and lose  your virginity swoozie, you should have just LoVeD HeR!
Is this a re upload I swear I had already heard about the story back in the day lol
Star Wars one piece mini skirt damn 🤦🏽‍♂️ she knew what she was doin 🤣
A door can definitely give you a black eye if hit hard enough 👌
Omni man vs homelander who would win
i want a guy like you 0-0 i almost choked why she aint date you then tf
Why doesn't Swoozie make a video about getting caught in 4k?🤔
I remember this one girl at school told me she got two black eyes because she passed out I never believed her cause how is that possible
I love your videos!
My guy u give some great relationship advice
How short was the girl and how high was the door handle 💀💀
Swoozie I love your videos. I hope you find the lady that is for you. She out there patiently waiting too. Anyhow, I have had friends like that I know that man most likely is living his best life and she is most likely miserable. It’s only 3% of woman that would leave the rest of us stay. All because she doesn’t understand who she is and she doesn’t men.
Woooow!
Walmart Ne-yo is at it again😂😂🔥
The pick me or family thing is a bad example it's nearly always right to pick family however sometimes it isn't. It's situational
Wooooooow!!! 😄😄😄😄
A door can’t
Bro this was my ex with her baby dad 😒 only would hmu when he did her wrong. No advice in the world will save her
I can’t stop laughing at “wooow...”
Swoozie shoulda let her stay
Swoozie bro you should have done more for that poor girl... such a shame...
Swoozie, the only thing I would have done differently was I would have let her move in. Once she was out of her mess then I would nudge her towards getting her an apartment and living on her own.  People in toxic relationships stay in it because they rather stay with the demon they have than be alone a lot of the time. If they try to escape and that escape fails though, that's when that shit becomes Stockholm syndrome, and it gets nearly impossible for them to get out after that.   That's just what I think. Gotta get people out of their mess first cause if they fail to escape it's game fucking over.
needed this video 9 months ago but still
Swoozie you probably dodged a bullet by not letting her live with you for a month.
I’ve given myself a black eye with a door 😂 it can be done
Your life will be a billion times better without them
literally had to liaise a toxic asf relationship between my female friend from childhood and my brother💀💀
Dag I feel bad for her. I guess she felt that you didn’t want her so she gravitated to someone who did, even if that someone was toxic
That's the flaw you were looking for swoozie. 😂
Imma be honest. Swoozie. Sometimes you a chicken bro 😂
Excellent advice
Swoozie: "The better I got at chess the better I got at making life decisions" 10:52 *plays a4*
SwooZ sound pretty toxic himself to me too, but for SwooZ it's the calculating part. He's careful with his love and his body.
I shared this video with a friend who’s in a rough space. Thank you, Swoozie.
I don't know it seems to be in this story that this girl was lovely and you weren't ready to actually be happy with her. And even though she told you she was in a difficult situation multiple times and finally asked you for help and maybe protection, since this guy is so violent she had to hide in the bathroom, you make it sounds you were more concerned wioth your game moves instead of actually helping her out.  Btw, since you asked, yes doors can give you a black eye. My mother walked into a door and she got one ^^". Anyway maybe I misunderstood what you said or there are some things that I don't know happened that lead you to be this defensive from this girl. It just concerns me that she seems to ask you for help multiple times in the span of more years. I wonder if she didn't feel comfortable talking with her friends and family about this. Too many information I dont know to understand what happened here.
Swoozie I got a black eye from a door so yes you are wrong
“Woooow”
As an extremely clumsy person I can confirm that doors do give black eyes depending on the angle you hit.
It might have been the doorknob, swooze
Every time he said _wₒₒₒₒw_ .. I felt that
on god this is exactly what happened to me december 2020 i feel really bad for swoozie :<
Ive got a friend who is in a relationship with a VERY toxic girl. Me and a couple of common friends and pretty much every of his friends have tried to tell him that he is making a mistake so many times. They break up, he blocks her, he starts talking shit about her(all of it true) when we are hanging out and in like two days they are back together. Theyve broken up and gotten back together at least 6 times and those are just the ones I know of. At this point Im like ok do whatever you want Im just gonna stand back here and not say anything bc every time I start thinking about this I just want to brake sth. I dont think theres anything more I can do. Swoozie i wouldnt mind an advice.
toxic people looks stupid for the rast of the world
I've been following you for years and its sad that you don't have any good luck with women
The “wows” are perfect
Every now and then I wonder if all of Swoozie's stories actually happened just because there are so many crazy ones haha... Either way, I don't care- he puts out some of the best content on YouTube. It makes me so happy to see that he's still going strong after all this time!
"You wait a couple months then you gon see 0:26 "
Preach it Swooz. I was in a toxic relationship and you’re 100% correct about everything with this.
Cockie
You can get a black eye from doors, it happens all the time with me, you just gotta come at it from a certain angle
I felt that pain when I heard  " they just got married "
Beerio kart > tipsy Mario kart
Where have you been Swoozie
Wooowww
WOW!
When you say "Toxic people", I believe you mean "Narcissistic". There are two types, "Grandiose" & "Vulnerable". This girl sounds like the Vulnerable type, but really, they both stink.
The wow close up scene really gets me 😂
Plot twist...his name is "The door".
I got the biggest black eye from a bo staff right beside my eyebrow, so 100% a door could give a black eye 🤙
Does anyone know what girl he's taking about
Damn swoozie you spittin still?? an after all this time wooow lol 🎯
you hit the sweet spot
i would let swoozie be my therapist
If door hit you either flat or corner, you would look like Jocker make up.
1: I always listen to his relationship videos as pure advice and entertainment.  2: she prob was crouching and the door came at the side of her face, and the crease hit her cheek so hard it couldn’t cushion the blow, giving her a black-esque eye, but not a complete black eye, as her jaw might hurt as well.  How I know… experiments, and experience. And lots of teeth.
He returns!
Great thumbnail 👌🏾
“Know your value…and add tax.” Words to live by
Ultimate game book of nerds section 3 sub section 9.58f: assume all people in game Is a dude even if they speak and sound like a lady
If you aren't happy single, you wont be happy when you get in your relationship Relationships should add to your happiness not be the reason   Thats a Bar Swoozie 🔥🔥
Bro she was definitely trying to get with you in those "30 days back on my feet"
8:54 I'm not about to tell you if her story was legit or not but I can tell you from personal experience that a door can very much so give you a black eye.
people are so weird. the amount of time wasters that swoozie come across is crazy.
That ur wing man
I'm loving your outfit Swoozie.
Everybody I asked out my crush, and she said yes!  I have a date planned for July 2nd! wish me luck! :D
Love the video, is your finger okay?
everyone's hating on ann in the comments but she's on a bad road, give her some sympathy.
Ayo someone pls lemme get a Swoozie going "Word?... wow."
Please tell me swoozie watches one piece
I think this dude has just ran out of real/good stories and now he's just talking concepts.
"can I live with you for a month?" ... "how about I one-up you and give you 2 months somewhere else" ..." Sorry but no"
6:52 girlll I ain't even remember😂😂
I really hope she’s okay. Toxic relationships are so scary to get out of.   Long summary of toxic relationship ahead. TL,DR at the end:  I got into one toxic relationship where the guy gaslighted me into staying with him and into saying I love you after just 2 weeks. He also guilt tripped me, contacted me several times throughout my day (everyday for 2 months) and still said I never put time into the relationship, and he always tried to separate me from my friends. After two months, I finally got out with a final “get help” and “leave me alone” and he continued to contact me throughout the month after with messages sent to try to pull me back in, and to hurt me with my insecurities that I shared with him. He only stopped once I got police involved.   This nightmare of a relationship all occurred for me who had a good group of friends (I didn’t let the guy meet them) to tell me that what I’m experiencing is abuse, and that I need to get out of this relationship.   I can only imagine how painful and scary it would be to be in an abusive relationship where the abuser had more leverage after the potential breakup or the abuser was more integrated into one’s social life.   One thing I can say is that in spite of the many hurtful things the guy said to me and all the trouble of getting the cops involved, it felt all so much better than the two months I was in a relationship of that sort.   If you can find a way. Take it. If not. Carve it out somewhere. It’s difficult, but doing so is worth it.  TL;DR: I was in an abusive relationship for 2 months. Had to get police involved after he wouldn’t leave me alone. In the breakup he said many things to hurt me but it still felt better than the two months I was in the relationship. I have no regrets from breaking things off. I was lucky to have good friends to help me get out. Getting out of an abusive relationship is not easy, but very much worth it. Take care of yourselves people. You are worthwhile and deserve to be treated okay.
Okay. Swoozie dropped a video. Grabbing the popcorn
The Star Wars mini skirt was a red flag . When a woman hits” all the marks”, sometimes she has internal work to do to be in a relationship. Making this statement before even watching the whole vid
Bro if email me I will tell the problem I have and you can use it for your video and hopefully you can give advice on what to do
Well you can sit on the floor and the doorknob can hit you right in the eye if you're close to it
“know your value and add tax” 🔥
Is he wearing a thimble on his right hand?
Where're colours dude?
Lemme get this straight. You said "I will buy your ticket outta there. I will literally pay your first month rent. You get two free months of rent to get on your feet." AND SHE DECLINED THAT??? like she was ready to come live with you, stay with you, cook for you, get attached to you to get out of this relationship. She was not looking for a way out. She was looking for another co-dependent relationship. Less toxic than the current guy, still toxic.
Okay so on the door sich, I cut the inner crest of my nose open and needed stitches while skateboarding and I hit my face on the concrete like how does it happen
thank you swoozie i'm a lil drunk right now but i've had a lot going on mentally and your video helped me a lot.
Swooozieeee you texted my a while back on snap I really will never forget that I appreciate you!
I don't comment on YouTube videos often but this might actually be my favorite video yet
i like how he gets dressed to sit in a room and talk to a camera that would be awkward for me
sWooZie a piimmp man always got a story about a girl
John 3:16-18  Jesus loves you  Jesus is coming back very soon to judge this world and set up his kingdom that will reign forever and ever. Hell is real,hell wasn't made for humans but for fallen angels but if you reject Jesus and his sacrifice you will end up in hell. Whoever you worship on earth is who you will worship in the afterlife. Repent before it is too late. Please i plead with you for the sake of GoD.
HEY GUYS SWOOZIE IS BACK    Random man: WAIT WHAT
Wow swoozie this literally happens to me today this is just fantastic man
All 💯 percent true I swear you learn so much from YouTube Especially this guy right here👍🏾😏✌🏾😁
Well my dad crashed into a window and it hit his eyebrow (I think, I don't remember) but it gave him a black eye haha and then it looked like he had some eyeshadow but just in one eye
“Wow” “Word, Wow”
Wise words as always swoozman
“A few months ago”
See the signs that show how hard you trying to find what’s wrong just makes it funny lol 😆
It was not the door
is that a Goorin hat Swoozie?
To be honest If you date men they’re sassy as hell
oi the handle coulda hit her eye
Swoozie just be shooting them down….
A door absolutely can give you a black eye. However, the fact that he was *going to hit her*, she just ran away and got decked by the door instead.
"Know your value and add tax." I felt that <3
swoozie is a genius
You gotta be in a relationship first
"Lemme tell y'all a quick little story" me: WAIT! -grabs popcorn-. Proceed.  I can sort of see the position the girl was in. With a heart as big as hers, despite her knowing what is the right thing to do, just hearing that the guy promises to change or that "it will never happen again" would make it hard for her to leave. She either wants to give him the benefit of the doubt and hope he means it or she's too scared of leaving him because of what he'll do to her. Judging by how he tells her to block you and all that, him marrying her / asking her to marry him is just another way for him to control her (speaking from experience).
I thought he had the cup thing from Monopoly on his finger
Doors can give black eyes, but it's still messed up
There is a possibility that she was hit by the door if she was going to close it and the side of the door hit her
This is bad bro she might end up even dead she needs to get out of there
babe wake up, swooz posted a new video
warning  don't date gamer girls warning warning
"know your value... and add tax."  pretty iconic & inspirational ngl
Big fact brother!!!!
My guy, she’s toxic. You’re a good dude, but when those toxic things happen and she’s texting or calling you about it...  She rushed into a relationship with the guy. Every bad thing that has happened is on her. Getting hit in the eye that’s not okay. That’s the one exception!!  Her boyfriend is toxic too. Yet in a way I can understand rushing into something and that jealousy as well as a lack of trust getting in the way of having legitimate happiness. She’s just looking to be with someone.
"Know your value...and add TAX." is a BAR.
Hey, drop more videos, please. A real fan 💯
Simp
Swoozie's head is too large for his body.. disproportionate!!
Straight facts Swoozie, straight facts
Dude i used to watch you when you forst debuted on youtubw and now look how youve grown!
Always remember that Jesus loves you always
i have a shirt that says "know ur value and add tax"😎
Yo portion control talk hit different
I’ve been watching Swoozie for more than half of my life. Son.
This dude sus af👍🏿
PREACH SWOOZIE PREACHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Quit saying females gd
Saying "if you break up with me, you'll never find anyone better than me" isn't toxic if that girl is literally treating you like garbage and your carrying 90% of the relationship.
Swoozie sed he has a few girls on his insta name anne Me:goes searches it up cuz your boys a ninja Insta:anne 1 result
She declined 2 months free in LA??
Who dis girl?
"Relationships should add to your happiness, not be the reason for your happiness." -  sWooZie 2021. That was some real words of advice. Thank you.
Good content
That’s what Ive been saying for the longest love yo self first before getting into a relationship facts
The portion control wine analogy made this video
Sounds like a wife material to me z 5:40
"Know your value, And add tax" Damn that is some hella good advice thanks swooz :)
Married?! Bruh....
1. He has money from youtube making millions a year.  2. Women are attracted for money and fame.  3. Dont be surprised if Swoozie get baby mama trapped or has STDs.
i may still be coming down from my high, but that 'add tax' bit, fuckin HIT
Oh my word! This story is like déjà vu!🙆🏾‍♂️ I had a female friend who I briefly had a fling with - we at first used to talk almost on a daily basis and got really close,but it's like once she started dating a guy(a previous ex of hers), our communication started to reduce until she would no longer respond to or open my texts. On one rare occasion when she responded to me, she told me her guy wasn't happy with her talking to male friends and that's why I shouldn't text because if she responds he'll get jealous. Next thing I hear is that she had moved in with him and is engaged to him... Btw,the same guy has a history of hitting her, but she claims "he's changed now". I just wish her the best and really hope that the dude really has changed because she's a really nice person who's tiny as well
*TOXIC AF*
dam i pressed the video and I saw his drip and I said DAAAAAAAAAAAM
So I dated a girl who called me  Manipulative bc she searched up what manipulators do ig and she showed me a screen shot and said I do all those things. And honestly I think we was doing fine this was so random like out of the blue and ye still pissed to this day how im hurt bc she believed something on the internet just bc I did those things (one of those things was the guy being really nice kind of like charming u)
John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17-For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen
*"Relationships should add to your happiness not be your source of happiness"*  ~~~Swoozie 2021
8:49 got me laughing hard😂😂
"wow" - swoozie 20221
You should have allowed her to stay with you what where you thinking.
“I’ve been in a toxic relationship once or thrice” 😂
sus
He probably kick the door hard enough and it’s not wood probably
Yep, a door can give u a black eye, I experienced it myself.
Bruh how do you even find a girl on xbox looool
Swoozie = Captain Saveahoe
A good sign is if they claim to be made of toxic waste...not even joking
I’d let her stay at my crib tbh
This woman is actually perfect
The lack of background music is weirdly unsettling
Swooze, I dunno if you'll see this comment but my man you have no idea how much I needed to hear this right now. I just got out of a toxic relationship with a girl who was abusive and has done nothing but obsess over and talk bad about me. I really needed that speech at the end and I'm so happy you do what you do. Thanks for the inspiration man
Everytime I see a girl with a beautiful pfp, I keep telling myself the same thing...     "Stop, they don't exist."
Hay swoozie thx for the advice
Wwwooooooowwww
She was clearly asking for help, I would have let her live with me. I don't get the idea of a girl being to clingy doesn't that mean she wouldn't cheat on you and show you constant love. Isn't that what a girl suppose to do?
Technically,if he had a good start and was at a solid speed,that door can hook u up with a nice black eye.
I think Swoozie is the type of YouTuber talks about things, that makes people to scare to talked about.
I'm a female and I hate clingy guys. What a turn off!
Am I the only one in the comments trying to find who this girl is he's talking about.
FYI, I'm Asian and my face is pretty flat. My eyes aren't inside skulls like y'all 😂
I love you and your story’s you remind me of my dad a lot when I am sad I love watching your videos
That’s not having a big heart. She has dependency issues and she’s obviously a pick me and manipulator. I wouldn’t be surprised if u found out at some point that everything she told you was a lie. She literally ticks all the checklist. Guys fall for it more than women do because men value women more for their looks than women value men for their looks.
I'm convinced swoozie is destined to be forever single lmao
Nah we call it beerocart lmao
“Know your value...and add tax” 🤩😂😂👏🏼
I am currently pooping watching this video.
Did you hear back from the girl?
thats my father ,he does all of this with my mother 😶
lol "...and add tax"...bruh you killing me
Great video and thank you great advice.
Damn I'm hurt so this is why guys thought I was a dude
I feel so horrible for her. I’m only hoping that with age he matured and realized his mistakes but the likeliness of that is slim unless he got help. I really truly hope she’s doing well and he doesn’t burn out the light she had.
“A few months ago we talked about toxic friends.” BRO THAT WAS ALMOST A YEAR AGO 😂😂
Bro I'm so trini you said "wine" and I thought "whine" ngl that would've made this story even more epicly bizarre🤣 and you could've save that girl man!

If the doors kicked really hard then yes it can give you a blackeye I should know because I have gotten a blackeye from the door
Ratings g, nuff ratings dawg, sending love all from the Caribbean. I just recently started watching your videos and you are extremely inspirational , keep up the good work man💯. From Trinidad ❤🇹🇹
W*oooo*W
Okay wait a minute did they get divorced?
Maybe the door Knob hit her
I knew there was going to be a Part 2 after he said she drove hours to get him a game Lol in the other video Lol
T will forever stand for toxic
Hilarious how he said "Once or Thrist" 🤣🤣
Swoozie is the best life coach.
Swoozie is the only guy who can unironically wear a fedora without getting the nice guys/incel vibes
Some times your mates family is toxic
Easy solution is to not answer the phone for a drama queen who is looking for a relationship with someone else other then you.  Now if you want the friendship and enjoy listening to their drama fine. I would of dropped her in a heart beat and not stressed my self with her problems.
I got tired of friends in toxic relationships complain to me. Eventually I just learned to say "Just break up."   No one complains to me about it anymore.
Here’s her club penguin💀
Relationships should add to ur happiness not be the reason for ur happiness                         ~sWooZie 2021

The bottle analogy was kind of spot on ngl
why does this sound familiar
this has such a sad ending what the heck
Every boy simps over her  She chooses the toxic one  Come on man
BRUH?!
*chews popcorn* 🍿
“Know your value, and add tax” is the single best piece of advice I have been given. I just got out of a toxic relationship and it’s so hard to not go back, I know I have to stay away.
I think with her I believe there's a fear with her. If she doesn't go thru with it  she probably feels in danger. I'm not sure but from the story that could be the case. It's too bad because she sounds really nice
9:00 [Swoozie] : Can a door give you a black eye? [Me] : Time to slam a door in my eye.  [Me] : Yes Swoozie it does now my eye is black :D  Was it worth it yes.
Females are some else I’m a pos and somehow my female knows “ur cheating arent u” idk how she knows but she says she just feels it
Man's could have been the one to marry her lol.
Bob do be a trol
Bro kinda sold the bag😭😭
“Know your value, and add tax” swoozie be SPITTING spitting
When sWooZie posts I smile
Those accounts that dm you stuff like that are usually bots

Yo this video helped me a lot thanks swooz!! 👍

Swoozie is a real doozie
You could've been her husband but you chickened out because she was clingy .... w o o w @12:04
Watch Alex Clark after this
1:00 she'd be sick lol
This Anne person was toxic herself and she attracts toxic men and tried to drag you into it.  It's all manipulation.  I stop feeling bad for people like that if they don't just leave.
This was some SOLID narrative. Even for me! Great vid!
Swoozie can you please start referring to women as women and not females?
Doors can probably give a black eye if she got hit with the edge of the frame and not the flat part of it and if she was angling her face trying to keep the door closed.  I can envision, but I am only guessing based on third hand information here.
Swoozie a high ranking youtuber in my books.
I'd just like to take this opportunity to say I have no relation to notastalker247
Anna is on some sayu-chan vibe
Hahaha Swoozie's "Wow" is hilarious bc I was doing it too
I know I'm toxic af so have proposed to stay single for everyone else's sakes.
“Know your value ... and add taxes” AMEN
Doors automatically shape into a fist when kicked at a certain speed…..her story makes sense
Bro u ganna be gay before you get a gf
Why on earth are you looking for a Girl Friend on X-Box. That is the last place I would look.
I think Swoozie needs to find a Christian girl from church or something
Bruh
Wow
Swoozie: *surprised Pikachu face*
when swoozie said that he reminded me of the great words of one of the(correction:)greatest TV show characters PERIOD: "Your soulmate is your compliment,not your missing piece."
“Know your value, and add tax.” I like that. I like that a lot. Love you Swoozie ♥️
I don’t know swoozie blood ain’t thicker than that bottom
Yeah it is possible to get a black eye from a door if the blood vessels around the eye are hit so badly that the swelling extends to the eyelid = black eye, similar to how the swelling from a wisdom tooth can result in a black eye  Very very unlikely, but possible, I guess, depending on how fragile her face bones/vessels are and how hard the door hit her

Swoozie I hope you know that your wow face is now my favourite meme now
Im so scared of toxic relationships that as soon as I see more then 1 🚩 I start distancing myself... I've had to block/ ghost 2 guys because 1 got really upset that I told him "I didn't like it when guys who aren't my bf call me bae " the 2nd  one got mad because I wouldn't let him kiss me again.
I’m scared to watch your videos now swoozie because I’m watching this and agreeing with every point you make and comparing it to my last relationship. I’m sitting here like “why didn’t notice any of this before” and as soon I said that out of nowhere that ex just text me😂
We’re nice 😂
Post more
Swoozie shoot your shot early, women don’t want to wait forever for a man that they are interested in. Four years is way too long, sue probably was waiting for you to make a move
Swoozie you need some chill out time bro. Never seen anyone so stressed, change your scenery and circle
I believe you dodge a bullet because she was pregnant and wasn't telling you.  That's why they had a fight and she only wanted to live with you and not the free apartment. That's why she moved with his family and then got married even though he cheated.

This is the best YouTuber
I got a black eye from a door when I was 13.  The guy behind the door was angry, slamming it as I was walking in.
"females"😰😰
I've given myself a black eye with a door but ya know
Why is no one in this comment section talking about how that girl is most probably in an abusive relationship. Swoozie if what you're saying is true, get her parents involved or a close friend of hers.
A door can give you a black eye depending on the angle
I swear swoozie is gonna be single for a Verryy long time sir u had it all lined up and you said no Bc she was clingy oh may gad
Dang... That marriage part had me dead...😂😂😂😂😂💀💀

No a door can not give you a black eye,unless you get hit by the door nob or the edges of the door.

Needed this today
Passive, goody goody people are toxic as well. They live to be a victim. They love to be enablers.
The fedora and the use of "females" is really clashing with the relationship advice and throwing me off. But good vid.
"Relationship should add to your happiness" Genius 💎
That "wow" is going to trend on Twitter
Was I the only one who fell down like Swoozie on the married part??
ayo he spittin
I’m not surprised he made out with her Swoozie is just different like that

Swoozie what do you do when the toxic person in the relationship is genuinely sorry but can’t seem to comprehend what needs to be done to fix the situation?
I’m pretty sure that a door can give you a black eye if it hits you at the right angle because it could avoid hitting your nose.
from personal experience, you can get a blackeye form a door, trust me
Swoozie..swoozie..we need music in the videos swoozie
13:29 I legit thought you're friend was about to be like "I'm dating her." lmao
If the door hits you in the nose hard enough, you'll get a black eye.
So basically was a bystander to a toxic relationship and avoided a clinger.
Nah my boy got a black eye from a door once 💀💀💀 it’s definitely possible but anything could have happened
"Wow." ~Swoozie 2021
Everyone who disliked this video is toxic
This guy is like Taylor Swift ... Can get into a solid relationship else he won't be able to create new content.

Can someone tell me who he’s talking bout if you know... thanks in advance
I wanna see what she look like
As a toxic person I feel attacked
Dear person that's reading this, we don't know each others but I wish you all the best in life don't ever blame yourself, accept things and go forward. Your smile is precious and a key for happy life.  Love from a small YouTuber❤

Swoozie looking fresh with the fedora.
Bruh I see both of us in this video, 😂
9:14 had me cryinggg😭😭
okay so i 100% have gotten a black eye from being hit by a door ( not by a partner, just me being stupid ) so yes, it is possible but i see your concern and still think its questionable
Bro someone meme Swoozie's wow face
Yeah you can get a black eye from a door it's weird but you can.
this is why im weary of people who brag about having such a “big heart”, who do overly nice things when you barely know each other, & who try to get super close to you the first time yall meet😭its nice & flattering in the beginning but from personal experience….it never ends well
OHHHH SHOOOUT bandits an og for sure
The door itself can’t give you a black eye but the door frame can
Believe it or not girls like guys like that
maybe it was the doorknob that hit her eye?
I really hope she's OK. I hope their relationship grew and became more stable. I hope she's happy and maybe that the family came around.
STAR WARS man shes a keeper
Wow 😱 Swoozie: Happiness first relationship later Me: Happiness have run my whole 11 years till today and relationship got no sight😑😔
What if the handle/knob of the door hit her eye? Or maybe not, she'd have to be really short for that to happen.
Trying to figure out why he isn't with this girl. I'm starting to think it's for content jk 🤣.
My guy swoozie is out here giving advice, bro you should be a therapist
This story is over like 6 years😂
Why did i think of sssniperwolf when he said they got married. Maybe im tripping iono👀
“Know your value….. and add tax” yesss 😂
Swoozie have you never seen that video of the girl twerking in the bathroom and her brother slams the door open gave her the biggest black eye, so I mean it’s posible doubt that’s what happened but possible
hi swoozie just found out i have the same bday as u i hope yours goes well :))
Like the last 20 seconds of the video has all the meat 🍖I need. Took it, shook it and bounced.
No
maybe she fell onto the floor and the door handle hit her eye?
TOXIC COFFEE  CASEY IS OP HANZO IS A CLLAAASSSS
I needed this video now more than ever. Thank you, Swoozie
Ninjayla
Omg ….swoozie!  The women  you choose is so off! I’m sorry.  I know us people are not perfect but your stories about the choice of women to your liking are either superficial or toxic. I really hope you find that one true love that fully supports you and is compatible for you. 🙏🏽
Does she play league of legends ?
Had a gf who admitted to purposely taking her anger out on me when I would try to help her. I threatened to break up with her but she begged me not to. I gave her a second chance Come couple months later, our relationship gets worse and we're on eggshells. She ends up breaking up with me cause I told her we're not spending enough time together Y'all I'm begging you don't be like me If the person is giving red flags immediately dip Don't even wait around to see what happens. If you have to block, *BLOCK*

swooziee 💚 love seeing new videos from you dude
Swoozie's literally the only YouTuber that's been on here for over 10 years thats not problematic, like i dont think he's even had a scandal. He just chills, tells stories and minds his business
Swoozie you aint have to end with such a life changing quote like that 🤣 now imma say for the rest of my life fuck it
I need swoozies wow face as a gif it’ll be my reply to everything 🤣😂
i managed to get a black eye from running into a wooden pole so it isn't impossible
Thats how you know she was sketch. He offered to help, but because it wasn't at his place, she didn't want it
SWOOZIE is the relationship guru I'll choose to ask for help if i get in problem in my relationship ! 😂
A door CAN giev you a black eye....
Oh if the door hits the side of your face like kinda like she looked on the right or left so that’s probably what happened idk though
Swoozie where your kids at?
Sounds like she was love bombing you,  manipulative?
Know your value and add tax is something that I am genuinely taking into my life from now on. Thank you swoozie.
Depending on where she was when the door slammed it coulda hit her in the eye with the handle
Low-key she was offering the Wifey+ 30 day free trial to Swooz
Swoozie I’ve been watching you for 8+ years and as much as I love your advice and stories, I’m just waiting for the story where you tell us about a girlfriend who you think is the one. Much love to you swoozie. Keep up the great vids
5:44 her face was amazing (the same face as all girls)
I just got out of a toxic relationship. I don't know what to do at the level of toxicity after we broke up
if you can find the correct angle MAYBE you can get a black eye, but the angle needs to be exact and perfect, plus it depends on facial features.  you can still be suspicious of him tho since it needs to be too exact. Maybe she bent over and got hit by the door knob tho which is far more likely.
wise words from a wise man :)
7:09 I realize why I don’t have a girlfriend
I think I know how she got the black eye from to door I think the corner of the door hit her so it could hit around the eyeand give her a black eye
Such good advice love the content
I got a black eye from a door before. I was at an angle though because it was occidental
I had a friend in a toxic relationship. Dude was incredibly controlling. He had a "Three-strikes" rule where if she did stuff he didn't like, he gave her a strike. When she tried using the same thing, he told her to stop joking.  They broke up and she asked to hang out and talk. She talked to me and another friend over the phone. She told us about all the crap he did. But the more she said and the more we confirmed that her relationship was toxic, the more willing she seemed to go back and give him another shot. And she got back with him, briefly, before they broke up again.  Break-ups can be difficult to deal with, and sometimes it can be tempting to go back to something familiar. But you don't owe anyone a relationship that makes you unhappy for any reason. And it can feel bad being alone, but you will be okay.
I LOVE THIS MAN . His videos just fill me with so much joy idk why wtf
Getting hit in the nose or side of the head at the correct speed and location can give you a black eye              Don't ask how I know
2:50 This is me explaining to my mom why I don't play with my cousin online.
Yes and no. If she was shutting it right when he was shutting and she was facing the door then yes you can. This is from someone who recently got body slammed into a door and was asked how I could hurt my shoulder if it was flat surface against my back. Until they remembered the door has a frame.
So y’all still believe swoozie out here just making out with these women only we know you putting it down that’s why they go crazy 😜
See, this is why I am subbed to Swooz. I gives really good advice on life and he's funny too. Thanks for the content Swooz.
I used the door excuse a lot in high school to my parents when I would get into fights. I was also very clumsy and actually did walk/run/fall into a lot of doors. You can't get a black eye from a door being smacked into your face like that.
Hey man, this girl really likes you give her a chance. See how it goes. Trust me it's nice to have someone like her with you man. She seems flawless
Ngl this was a really good vid hats off swooz
It must be MS paint though.
My man is giving us life lessons keep the good work respect
Facts
Doors can give you a black eye
boy if you don’t take off that nasty ass hat
Dude,I just discovered your channel, great content. Greetings from Perú
making out alot lol
Swoozie I could've used this video about a month ago my boi
As a person I realized I'm a toxic person in my first and only relationship but it also might be due to my mental and emotional problems (undiagnosed) I'm hoping to get help by the end of the month to better myself for her   While we did break up I do love her with all my heart and I want to at least be a better friend to her than I was a boyfriend
You sold the bag bro
Do Doors give black eyes 🤔
A doorknob can give u a black eye tho
'Know your value... and add tax' 🤔I like it.
....sWooZie..... cute girls don't talk to you? Fine girls don't talk to you? Do we really have to go through your backlog of stories about you dealing with incredibly attractive women? Do I need to put you on the stand? Do I need to get judge Mathis in this joint? Want me to get your hand on the bible? Come on bro.
a door can give you a black eye
I remember my one toxic relationship.. I wanted out, I saw the signs, I didn't wanna be stuck like that, but every time I tried to leave I was greeted with "I'll kms if you leave me" and I just.. Couldn't? I wound up having to confide in a few friends, who kept an eye on him for me so I could get out of that shituation without any guilt or stress, but it was yikes.
Guess the way to keep a girlfriend is to be a complete asshole to her??
my single ass watching this: hmm 🤔 interesting
I have good tolerance for things but man....i would have called it flushing instead of snip snip...always have back up plan if things don't work out. he did not treat her right and she stayed, plus the family hated her. and they got MARRIED? 100xs worse....yuck. Poor swoozie, he's the nicest guy ever, AND I dig the water bottle visual. :)
POST MORE SWOOZIE WE LOVE U
I dunno, seems a little odd to make out with a girl and then keep her at arm's length like that...Unless you were making out with her with zero intent of pursuing anything else but that's not great in another way. But hey, each to their own.
I think you could've communicated to her that she was being too clingy and she would've backed off. She seems like a nice girl. Maybe she got so excited to finally meet you that she became clingy lol. Idk I feel like you could've tried telling her she was being clingy but still wanted to perhaps pursue something with her but taking your time.
I’m also realising that an ex of mine ticks almost all of these boxes you’re listing. Just not the cheating side of it. That I’m aware of anyway.  It’s been so many years, so who knows how things are now. I haven’t talked or seen them since.  Regarding doors and black eyes...I guess if you happen to be leaning forward? Saying that, I’m a klutz and have walked into many a thing. If there’s a way a door can give you a black eye, I’m sure I’ll find it.
Swoozie you are a failure as a man...... Whyyyy bro I'm almost too sure you are horrible at chess
If the door was at the same angle as the face at maby a 90% angle it could probably be possible to get a black eye
What if I am unhappy, because I dont have a relationship?
Longer uploads are bae!
Snip snip Toxic gone yall
Thought you left us man. Thank god you came back
MS paint 😭😂
That's what's up! 👀 That last part of the video especially after they got married! I felt that 😕
OMG right now, Iam overflowing with wisdom 😵😵
Keep uploading
NO your value & add tax. Brilliant! Gorgeous! Astronomically correct I’m so inspired ♥️ snip snip ✂️ well said 💯 🤧
Damn this story just gets darker and darker.
The corner of the door
I've only just gotten out of a toxic relationship, but it still hurts as I still care for the person even though I was treated like crap, great video 😀
OH YOU HAVENT HEARD THEY GOT MARRIED. whAT? wow
This one meant a lot to me thank you ☺️
From experience yes, a door can give you a black eye, but that story is sus as hell...
:O
This is so sad to hear, I wish I could step in and help in some way
..... I'm sorry sWooZie but you left this girl high and dry.... You are extremely reserved and not honest and blunt enough with how you express yourself.  If you had telepathy life would be a million times easier for you.  You should have given Ann a chance and rained in her clingy-ness with honesty, diplomatic affectionate honesty. Mate, that's my take away from this story.  Keep pumping out the great content (^_^)
That bottleneck analogy…I be like you can’t just go to the 8 gates…You have to let the charka flow thru the first 7 first but overtime slowly increase the charka flow to the final gate to open…( NARUTO FANS WILL GET THIS)
A door cannot give you a black eye
Wow... 😶
kiss of death, is that a darling in the franxx reference
The fedora has spoken
It might being the door handle that gave her a "black eye" And love the long vids
finally , I'M HUNGRY😭😭😭
Omg, yes a door can give you a black eye. If you manage to trip and hit the corner of the door in the area of your eyebrow, the bruise and blood and swelling will settle in your eye, giving you a black eye.... I know this personally, lol.
The drip is REALLLLLLL🥵💅
I think she just wants to be with you..
I got the most fucked black eye from a flat fence post so it happens
is it just me or does this person look like frank ocean in one side
I kicked a foor into my friends face one time and it left a sharp dent in his head
And add tax
Big F man. Super relatable. Now i kinda text her now and then how's she's doing and that's all. I don't ask questions. No deep convos happen. Just how are you. Are you happy?
"Know your value... and add tax"  ~Swoozie
swoozie your videos and especially your analogies are amazing "know your value, and ad tax" LMAO
That was a really good analogy
13:33 I'm laughing at how he fell onto his bed like a single LEGO piece toppling, my humour is broken
Bro in this video he looks like Pablo from Backyardigans (love you swoozie)
When your homie said what happened with those 2, I started laughing for a solid minute or 3. I can't 😂😂😂
LOVEINNNNNNNNNNNNNG the HAT
Girl : "he threw a pillow at me and I got a black eye because of it , he didn't hit me "
I need that 1 second clip of Toxic for my message ringtone
That's one moment were lying is good thing say she'll stay with you but then move her to the hotel
SINATRA?
Know your value, and add tax… i love it!!!
"A relationship should add to your happiness not be the reason for your happiness"  Best line ever thanks man ❤️
Anyone know her @ ?
Hey mn, feel like you could have prevented all this.
9:00 as a complete idiot, I can confirm you can get a black eye from a door. I've done it multiple times in my life. Doors hurt, and you don't need to actually get hit in a large area to get a pretty big looking bruise. I mean, it could definitely still just be a plausible cover story for something worse though, but yeah. Doors can give you a black eye.
Ima help you out by telling you Toxicity is a word 🥸
I feel so bad for you man I’m so sorry that shit even happened to you when you did nothing wrong, I’m glad you’re able to look past it and can just move on from it and go about your day like a grown adult but I know exactly what it was like to be in a relationship in like that, the thing about her was that she just didn’t want to change for me and now I know you can’t change anybody and they could only change if they really wanted to but I changed for her when she couldn’t change for me, I had a lot of trust issues and that’s just in general from every other relationship I’ve ever been in because of how much I got played and cheated on so I was just like that crazy boyfriend where I’d ask where she was and what she was doing and she told me the honest truth but my overthinking would get the best of me and so I wouldn’t believe her until she kept telling me over and over that it was the truth and after all of that of us going back and forth on that I changed so that we could be happier and so I trusted her and never thought twice about her word and everything was going great after that but from what I realized after being with her for 5 months is that some if not most of these problems stem from her because she has a bad bipolar disorder and so she would get so mad to the point where she’d block me and wouldn’t say anything till the next day or two and this happened multiple times and it fucked with me because since I’m an overthinker it’d make me think like what could she be doing not talking to me you know? I changed myself and believed her many times after she’d tell me all she want is me and she’s proved that but after the many times of her blocking me and getting so pissy with me off of things that she shouldn’t be mad about because it was either probably a stupid joke or she overthought about something when all I ever did is stay truthful to her I left because she just wouldn’t change for me and it was the saddest thing ever because I really loved, it’s hard to let things go that you love but it’s for the best sometimes and it sucks but you just gotta learn to love and be happy with yourself because the only one you’ll have is you, and even though I knew this from the beginning I just wanted to try and be happy with her because I had never felt this type of way for anyone in my life it’s not easy for me to love just anyone like that I’d never change for anyone but when I met her it was so different because she showed me a type of love I never had before, I tried so hard to try and help her so that we could be happy together but she never cared enough to try like that, this happened about a close to a week ago and it makes me sad even still but I’ve grown better from it and she’s helped me in many way I could ever imagine, I just wish it could’ve been us till the very end like we talked about
ADD TAX!!! AMEN!
I got my eye swollen a tiny bit from a door hitting me in the face but it took a day or 2 in a half to heal
I peep the close ups- what camera is that on?
I need a gif of swoozie going "WOW"
Another gem, lost into the pool of dirt and sh!t. Why am I not surprised.
Can we normalize NOT calling women “females” because we are more than just our genitalia
I am kinda sad there was no end credits music. Always looking forward to that bit.
bruhhhh swoozie why didn’t u just let her stay at ur place!! 😂
Weird that i just had a 6 year old relationship end:(
That bottle control thing was well said
Crazy how I just got out of a relationship that was toxic and swoozie post this 👀 now I gotta learn how to be happy first :)
Like, I honestly love you. You're such a good person.
LOVING the fedora homie! You actually rock it 😎
sWooZie has the most interesting life
Good one
Swoozie is a good big brother
Sad Ogga booga
“Know your value...and add tax.” The way Swoozie gave that great advice was halarious XD
“Let’s call her Ann”…then calls her “Anne” in the texts 😂
Big faccctts
Once in highschool my cousin rushed through the door from the other side, hitting me on the edge of my face and I legit got a black eye for a few days. The door hit me on the side of my face, hitting my cheekbone actually, and I still got a bruise all under my eye 🤭 So is it possible? Yes But is it probable though? 🤔
Toxic girlfriend: you will never gonna find a girlfriend like me. Me: I hope it happens.
hes back at it agian with the HEATED videos!
“Wow” -sWooZie
Nike boy say hi to me I’m desperate
Why didn’t you just let her live with you tho
Oh shit
Big fan swoozie know you probably won't see this but I wish you uploaded more keep up the great work
I really like the way sWoozie dresses,he wears nice clothes
I’m confused about if you know she’s a great girl and you know your crazy about her and she’s willing to do all these great things for you and has proven it before why wouldn’t you at least try dating her like he literally admits to wanting to “wife her” and it had been 4 years so maybe in her head it wasn’t fast to the “clingy” but idk it’s just confusing
If the door hits somebody in the right way it can give them a blackeye but your head has to be like tilted that way like she has to be tilting her head a little bit sideways just for the door to hit her in the eye like that but like you said the probability of that is low
Longer uploads!
nah fr if you turn your head and the door coming yo eye turning black
A door can, I gave my cousin a black eye with a door💀
Suicide I want to be in one of your videos but I’m under 18 🥺but I do love your videos do you still have a Xbox we can play gta online
Swozie a virgin bruh like you got all the chances to smash and u don’t
What if the edge hit that part of the face
Swoozie are you still saving yourself for marriage
Bro why didn't you make a move when you had a chance? It like you always hesitant on girls who are 10's
about the door thing this is kinda weird to say yes kicking a door into someones face can give you a black eye it happend to my mom i was there
Swoozie out here preaching and giving out advice to strangers on the internet, but someone he supposedly cares about is clearly in an abusive relationship and he's like "well I WANTED to do something, buuuuut"
We needed him the most, he returned
No. Toxicness doesn't "stop". Come on Swoozie.
Know your value.... then add tax
Youve grown so much I remember the fun 2min storytimes now it’s 15min insightful storytimes it starts off entertaining and ends off with a lesson ❤️
Ay yo swoozie. Stop calling women females plz!
This girl caught a bad case of domestic abuse. She need some healing Swooz. I ain't no genius but she should've left after the black eye.
I had to get stitches from running into the door when I was young
bro... ONLT IN HER BIRTHDAY HOW LONG YOU HAD THIS STORT FOR FOOL
Swoozie is my psychologist cuz goddamn he makes good points its insane
I’m hurt. I’m the multi player games friendly neighbor rat.
White so's that put their poc so's in situations where they have to interact with ppl who hate them bc of their race rlly suck..
Sooooo.......sWooZie what happened to your finger
Uploaf moar videos mr swozzie
sold
“Know your value, & add tax.”  I needed to hear that, thanks swoozie 💜
PAIN.
I made the decision to get happy on my own, and now i dont want a relationship lol
I felt that 'Bruh'!
Know Your value and add tax hit me hard thank you bro
loved the "woooooow" 😂
At 4:48 I got an ad and I was like “ I swear he’s gonna say i gotta go byyyyyyyyye!” Then the ad finished and he said byyyyyeee and I was just started laughing cuz I read him so hard
Not trying to sound mean, but that girl Ann sounds pretty dumb from what Swoozie just described as. She basically knew she was in a toxic relationship since she explained to Swoozie what happened to her along the way, yet she still decided to marry that toxic person. At this point, people won't even feel sorry for her because if a person wants to jump off a bridge, you can't save her forever. There's only so much you can do, and it's not your responsibility to save her every time.
A door can give you a black eye.
😬 when he says females tho
You know what mike says? “JUST DO IT” leave her my guy
A door can get you a black eye. Ive had some experience with that
(Im mexican ho was born in the usa) My dad wasn't loyal to his pregnant girlfriend, he got caught butt she became the toxic one, since I talked on the phone in English she thinks I don't speak Spanish. They fight all the time butt they still got married,they have been together for 7 years and still fighting, I'm almost 18 I can go to LA with my brother for a free month rent.
U can get a black eye if ur hit on the cheek too the blood just goes to under the eye area and it looks like a black eye even tho u were'nt hit there
Loving the content bro, being in a relationship has definitely revealed to me that I have a lot more to work on to be the best version of myself 👍
I’m pretty sure door can give you a black eye i gotta a black eye from a top bar of a bow
Swoozie NEVER misses.
“Know your value and add tax”, I love that.
I wonder if the ppl he's talking about ever hit him up after he makes a video on them
Know your value.... And add tax😂
snipperwolf?
thanks daddy for the advice
ann is like that package deal you want but ur too broke for
I got dejavú this whole video. Is this a reupload??
toxic life gang ,,,,
There are rare situations where a door can give you a black eye. And it usually involves the door knob not the actual door. From what I know because I've accidentally just swung on my door knob and then hit my doorknob into my eye. Oof
diary talk
Damn thats an amazing offer u gave her too bad she didnt take it might have done her some good but ya can only do so much to help a person still great of u to offer 😊
Never let a woman move in with you! You will never be able to get rid of her!
This Adam22 ?
Who else is going to live with this advice from now on ‘Know your value and add tax’. Thanks Swoozie can’t get enough of your videos never change ☺️
This is my second comment but time to reenact order 66 I’m watching this video it’s paused at 12 minutes and 10 seconds I’m going to reenact to order 66 if you know you know
This Chanel aged like a fine wine
this hit me
I have trouble understanding why people get stuck in toxic relationships. Can someone explain? Ie. How do you get stuck? If you moved in to live with them? solution, DO NOT move in with people that you haven't dated for a GOOD amount of time. Like, when you are considering marriage and want to know what it would be like to live with this person THEN you move in. Why is that so difficult? People causing their own dramas.
A slide gave me a black eye...
She must’ve been at a certain angle where the door hit her eye and her eye socket I’m pretty sure that’s how she got the black guy I’m not very sure
I am not sure, but this "Ann" sounds a lot like Annemunition, who is a streamer and competitive gamer who has a lot of male simps IMO. Might not be her, but reminds me of her.
Wow great day. Nintendo direct and a new swoozie vid.
I wish This video would have appeared like 3 years ago, maybe it would have saved me from a horrible toxic asshole and a move back to Russia from Germany 🤦‍♀️
This video makes me literally so sad, there are so many people in relationships with people that don’t deserve them in the slightest
best video so far
Prob for the best as all this girl was clearly doing was using swoozie. Using him for attention when she didn't have any.. using him to make her boyfriend jealous.. she didn't desperately need a new place to stay, she just needed attention while she fought with her boyfriend, that's why she turned down the rent offer.
I swear, Swoozie is like my freaking teacher for life. He has made me rethink over a lot of stupid stuff and i'm so glad i found this channel a couple months ago
Swoozie…can we have background music again? Plz
Amen
Dude how do you even get into these situations?!?!?
Sydnee Goodman😳
Swoozieeeeeee
Bro if your talking about the same place I’m thinking of and it’s called The Counter, that place has some incredible burgers tho
Swoozie giving us the sporadic big brother advice today!
“Know your worth and then add tax” the best advice I have ever heard!!!!
I was engaged to one, i postponed the wedding. My father later decided that he wasn't going to give me away in marriage to him. I honored that decision. Two to three months later i found out the cx fell  off   from his beliefs. Red flags are not meant to be excused, justified or ignored. They are wake up calls.
"know your value... & add tax." I need to frame this... everywhere. Immediately.
no
"came on too strong" bruh wtf
That was no door bro  Unless her door is flexible
“Girls this cute don’t talk to me”   *all his girl friends get pissed off* 😭😭😭
Swoozie you are a good person but it is your fault for putting up with all her crap 4 years, you selling your self short man…. Stop being girls tampon.
Swoozie don't be a simp please
I'm sorry swoozie but your in a toxic relationship with this girl you giving her time she don't deserve from u and being her emotional tissue everytime she has a problem she comes crying to you cut this chick off she ain't worth it
Ann sweating bullets watching this rn
“Know your value, and add tax”
I mean if like the corner end part of the door hits you then yeah😂😂
"Know your value and add tax."  I really needed that
You could've saved her bro
U still stay downtown tho ?
The part about get happy first then get into a relationship really hit me deep bc until just now I thought that was the answer swooz u really just answered a question I’ve been wondering about for the longest time and idek how to thank you.
So first of all, regardless of what's possible or not as far as a door smacking you in the eye, that doesn't matter because he did really kick the damn door in, and regardless if he knew she was directly behind the door she still kick the damn door in with the attempt to beat her ass. So regardless of what I'm about to say, at the end of the day he still basically hit her regardless if there was any skin-on-skin contact or not.  Regardless of where she got hit, he still hit her even if it was with the door regardless if it wasn't intended. Cuz he was still intending on beating her ass. With that said, yes it is possible to somehow get hit in the eye with the angle of the door maybe depending on how it's open and how you're angled towards the door. As stupid as it may sound, I've managed to put my own self in the eye when opening the door to the bathroom on the way out. How, I don't know. I wonder that all the try. I don't know how I managed to do it but it's possible.  But again we're talking about me poking myself in the eye, this is somebody attempting to hurt somebody else. Regardless of where it hits, he still kicked in the f*cking door. With the intent to hitter, which he basically did with the door as he kicked it in.  Again it doesn't matter where the door hitter it, he still hit her and he hit her with the damn door because he kicked it with the attend to be the rats. That's it, that's all. Piece of piece of sh*t and so are his parents if this is true. I am honestly writing this before I finish the video. So anybody ready to crack me as they're reading this, keep that in mind I'm about to finish it right.
“Relationships should add to your happiness not be your happiness” my man speaking a language I should’ve learned a long time ago
The heady chain revealingly jam because exchange postsynaptically develop amidst a cute tanzania. magical, elated professor
Love your relationship advice man, very helpful. Keep up the awesome vids, I'm digging the longer uploads.
make out = fucking, but that’s just a theory. A game theory
god i missed these regular videos, they give me seratonin  edit: HOLY SHIT BRO
what happens I communicate the problems but they say "I don't want to change who I am to please you"   like bruh do you not even care you're hurting me--
I 👏 wish 👏 a 👏 dude 👏 would 👏 try 👏 and hurt me. If you're in a relationship to where someone runs after you to hurt you its  best to leave.  I would not care who the person is if someone tried something like that i dont care how much i loved them ,they clearly dont love me enough. And its clear.  if they want to hurt me in any way. Im out ✌.  Ik my worth.
Dude, i could swear i was this girl. It's hard to see when you're hypnotized by perceived love.
You offered this girl two months free rent and rather than take it to get out of that situation she stays and blocks you?!  Leave her be
"Know your value. Then add tax."  damn what a line
The Britney Spears Toxic tho 😂
A door can definitely give u a black eye lmao😭😭
I like that “a relationship should ADD to your happiness…not be the REASON your happy” *GOLD 🙏 @swoozie
Bruhhhh the cut scenes where Swozzie goes "..... woww" are killing meeeee
Slime beneath me slime up above ooo you love my toxic love
Lemme tell you that I can in fact guarantee that a door can give you a black eye. I had a black eye for months straight because I'm clumsy as hell and walk into doors and walls when I don't wear me glasses because of depth perception issues and used to do that as a kid too before anyone knew I needed glasses. Daycare had even called CPS because of how often I got black eyes from walking into walls and doors. They didn't believe it until they saw me walk into the bathroom door and give myself a black eye again😅 Edit: I still have damaged scar tissue on my eyes to this day at 20 y/o
"A door can't give you a black eye" Oh my gawd you are terribly wrong.
you do know that you are one of the best og youtubers in the game right? Swoozie the goat
It just kept kept getting worse
Off-topic but nice hat lol
I actually really like that bottle analogy
That's your Accountabilibuddy Swooz, that's what you call him
oh my gosh my mouth literally dropped that she got married to that abuser!
bad thing happen to good people
Props
Swoozie using his powers for good again! Thanks captain swooze :)
It’s the “ know your value “ for me
“Wooooow” 🤣🤣
no but why did she turn down your deal? I'm guessing she just wanted to stay with you or her bf
Stop saying ‘females’.
kinda almost broke a girls nose with a door yes its possible to get a black eye from a door speaking from experience. (it was me i got the black eye)
Love how Swoozie’s new iPhone low key matches his shirt 😎💧
Very cool Swoozie. I like your videoes. They are down to earth and I appreciate that. Stay strong.
“know your value and add tax” mm
Based on the personality you described I would be inclined to believe she's much like a friend I used to have who had this deep and innate desire to feel loved and wanted no matter how badly they treated her. Getting really clingy before you're even in a relationship, getting into relationships quickly, etc.; she needs therapy and it would take a lot of abuse on her end for her to see it, and unfortunately no matter how much I tried to help my friend she just kept re-entering or seeking out new toxic loops. It just really, really sucks to be that person on the sidelines watching them essentially self-harm by proxy.
Swoozie man, I'm pretty sure half these girls you tell stories about feel lead on.  And how do you never end up getting into a relationship with any of them?  I mean dude, you are no ordinary man.  Just saying but I actually feel sorry for some of the girls you befriend.  Other than that, good advice.
I love that swoozie always providing us with some fuckin truth bomb quotes in this types of videos <3
If swoozie made a podcast telling these stories on god I would listen them
i swear everytime i break up with someone this man got a new break up video what the hell
You can get a black for a door I have
I won’t even lie u just described my relationship I was having with this girl we broke up today but you really made me realize that she was toxic
I fell and hit my eye on a door handle and got a wicked black eye and a concussion, that’s the only way I could think about how that is even remotely possible
Wooooooow
I’ve definitely done the clingy thing and scared a dude off 😭 it was right after I got out of a relationship and I was so desperate- so embarrassing
Doors give scar not black eye that would be smacking
I had a friend who had a nasty argument with her significant other like that. My friend ran to her room scared, the dude kicked the door into her, but instead of a black eye it split her forehead open. She got rushed to the emergency room for stitches. She has a scar now that looks like Harry Potters
Sounds like an untreated BPD person getting into a relationship with a narcissist. Idk.
Maybe the door hit her brow bone, and that's kind of a black eye so
Anne is wild
Bro, I literally just barely got out of a toxic relationship, broke up like 3 hours ago smh  Like no joke, she was my girlfriend… She would force me to stop hanging out with my friends and family.. she forced me into bad habits and I started blaming it on the fact that she had been through a lot of trauma.. finally my ma piped up and told me that she is very toxic for me.. I tried to defend her and after an hour I realized all of the red flags. I freaked out and broke up with her.. luv you Swoozie :p
missed u swooze!
A door can give you a black eye. it is possible, but that doesn't mean you shouldnt be suspicious.
Anyone who willingly stays in a relationship like that has no control of their life
Swoozie really had me swinging a door to my face to see if I could possibly get a black eye. 🤣
I would never let her stay with me
She acts like a 15 year old 💀, she wanted to live with swoozie just to be clingy to him and not to be lonely. She’s dependent on people and that’s toxic because swoozie isn’t trying to be her emotional cuddle bear and he’s really smart to think of another plan to help. Just shows how dependent people aren’t good for you in a relationship whatsoever.
Every time something happens in my life swoozie makes a video about it! swoozie u gotta stop stalking me bro, it ain’t a look dawg
If you are unhappy before a relationship don’t get in one. Get a cat. They’ll make you happy. ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ
Well said! Where were you a decade ago?
9:00 People can get black eyes by slamming their nose into something, though I think for you to get a black eye, youd end up with "racoon face" and very likely a broken nose too. I'm skeptical, but its certainly possible.
he kick the door and hit her
Damn I missed these!!!♥️🤝🏽
Deez you say..
I tried out the hard way they can give you black eye
8:00 Analogy makes sense to me, but Im also a very spacial person and also VERY much agree
“And add tax” that’s new.
dam :/
Why is the ending a little sad 😪
My face from 13:30 and the rest of the video: 😯
I’m sorry I am one
Swoozie is a love God I say a Gwaaaaadddddd!
It can be done
A door cant give u a black eye my dude, unless she was pressing her face DIRECTLY on the door. He hit her, no doubt
SWIIZIE 1:21 wife that shit. Stop being to picky BRA
I think you could get a black eye from a door. I got a black eye from texting and walking into a pole.
14:07 is the reason I broke up with my ex. I was unhappy by myself, but she wasn’t. I broke up with her, let her be free. And now I’m working to be happy on my own. Swoozie knows
I have gotten a black eye from a door. Granted it was from the knob bit I do know people who have gotten messed up eyes from a door
a cutie asking swoozie about help with her black eye swoozie:      *hey'all homies help me out*
Is squeezy let her live in her house permanently help you pay rent and some of the bills
"Know your value and add tax" is a word. I need this in needlepoint and on a magnet.
To me I've seen this already?
"Anne" was love bombing you. It's a technique used by a toxic person in romantic relationships in order to manipulate the other person into doing what the toxic person wants them to do. It's like when your mom buys you a new toy and then expects you to do extra chores without being asked. Except on a much more serious level. The toxic person showers their partner in attention and gifts without provocation, but expects something in return, like money or sex.
If I’m ever in a Toxic Relationship.   And she say “you’ll never find another girl like me”   Shiiiiiii that’s the Plan💀🤦🏾‍♂️😂
Some people have high door knobs so maybe that’s how
Ok guys I figured out Swoozie’s secret message.  He LOWKEY wants us…to make a tinder profile for him. He can’t do it himself cuz his pride won’t allow it 😎
This is the Ted Talk I need to watch.
I mean like… DO YOU KNOW LULULOVELY?
Bro u could of had her all wife up but u chose not to 🤦🏾‍♂️
As a long time member of the fgc, this story sounds like Sherry. I won't say last names but it's uncanny. Competitive tournament player, shipped out with another fgc'r, ended up hurt, yada yada yada.  Crazy.
''know your value and add tax'' love it
Why did NRG Lulu come into my brain
"Know your value. Then add tax"! Literally the best way to put it 🙌🏻
‘If you’re in a toxic relationship, communicate what the problems are and work on them. Once you communicate that to them and they still don’t do anything about it, leave! Know your value and add tax$$$.’ Swoozie  *mic drop*
“ know your value and add tax” 👏🏾👏🏾
Some time he get me so mad I’m only here like give me that love 🥲
What ab TimTom
I rock with you Swooz, but I feel you dropped the bag on this one. Clearly she loyal lmao. Only thing that was off about her was that she is clingy???? That’s it?? You coulda easily just dated her and controlled the pace yourself, she waited around for a cheater…. There has to be something else that was wrong with her. If not, you frfr dropped the bag.
am i the only one that knows Swoozie is hella gay?
POV: you scalping YouTube for zwoozies new videos
8:52: Sure, you could get a black eye from a door swinging open -- the edge can hit across your eye socket and hurt like a mofo.  I still question how truthful her story was, and especially whether the relationship ever got non-toxic, but the door/black-eye story is at least plausible.  I'm actually pretty impressed by Swoozie's knowledge of healthy relationships.  I'm not too surprised, since I've been watching his videos for awhile, but I think just the number of different women he's had relationships (or almost-relationships) with makes him seem a bit like a player to my subconscious mind.  His actions (at least according to his stories) do seem to contradict that, though.  A player usually doesn't have that kind of knowledge of healthy relationships, either.
ex: im glad we broke up  me: k  ex: you're never find someone like me  me: that's the point  my fbi agent: 😮
Big hearts are big targets for narcissists.
"Know your value...AND ADD TAX."
Not defending the douche who gave the lady a black eye. But if the door hits in the right spot around the eyebrow, it will go black and swell closed. My toddler headbutt me on the eye brow and I carried that shiner for 3 weeks.
The door could have hit her top of the chin, which she could have described as a black eye
I been in two relationships where the family didn't like my ethnicity so I choose to leave both
NEW SWOOZIE VIDEO. LETS GOO
"Woooooow"
Watched the vid just to make sure I ain't toxic...   fuck...
I’m so curious to know who Ann is.
It's crazy to think about how much swoozie influenced how I get girls😂
“Know your value, then add tax”
7:00 bruh the amount of heartbreak I got from this point on, she was the chosen one!! She was so close to perfection!! But oof... she just wasn't the one in the end.
All Because a Door Hit Her
Swooz looking like a ghetto Jason Derulo
Where was this before I found out my ex was toxic 😂
What is this fit man 💀💀💀
You've known this person a longgg time. I'd say try talking to a relationship therapist or an expert, someone who knows what to when you're on the outside looking in
Damm Swoozie video is 15 min and it felt like 5 😂
“Here’s her Club Penguin, send everybody”
They get married till they get divorced
I wanna know all the women he talks about. Can we do a Freaky Friday Swooze? 🙏🏽🤞🏽
Man. You missed your chance come on man, come on you could’ve had the finest shawty.
Swoozie quote: Relationships should add to your happiness they shouldn’t be the reason for it.
She's gonna get killed.
Spittin nothing but fax sheesh
The IRS found it's way into our relationships XD
This is an all to common scenario people get in these kind of relationships and they start making excuses for staying. A lot of the time it ends badly.
Actively searching a long list of female competitive esports players for the past 5 years that play games that swoozie doesnt like that also has a insta, xanga, tumblr, and club penguin account that are also married
the only langue swoozie speeks is fax
I swear the most toxic relationships get married/engaged so fast 😭✋🏻
Swoozies wow face is so funny to me
Plz put the new art style then the old one its much better whit the new art style
She mario karted into some swoozie I’m crine 😭😭
“Add value then add tax” I think that’s advice you should take. Once she changed the terms of the relationship, you should’ve terminated it. I personally don’t believe everything she said
"Know your value, plus add tax" Welp, that's a quote I'm using now
Damn good advice
Amen Swoozie amen
Relationships should add on to your happiness not be the reason your happy-Swoozielation 13:3
Themis story has me like: 🤨🧐🧐🙃🙃🙂🤪😜🤪🥴🤨🧐🤯 whAT
im deadddd  swoozie your vids are gold, its kinda like im chillin with a homie or smthn lol
i love clingy girls tbh. just my personal opinion
Ain’t no dang way on this good green Earth I’m letting someone take advantage of me like that.  First off you cheating ain’t no second chances at least to me there’s like a 0.0001% chance of me being with that person again. Also I like possessiveness to an extent,but no body is gonna tell me who I can’t hang with/talk to, Relationships shouldn’t be like that at all unless both parties are into that thing.😑👀
I believe it was Tamara Mowry who talked about the difficulties of being an empath. Narcissistic people love empaths because it's all about them...basically
“Woooooow” has me dead every single time 😂😂
u fumbled the bag
Was I the only one who thinks she's also toxic?
Swoozie I’ve been watching you since your high school stories. Been 8 years now and I’ve never not watched one of your vids
Swooz love it man keep it up
Ann = Pokemane🤪
Could you talk about toxic parents\grandparents
Great advice my dude 💯  Be happy alone first.
I've have had a lady I was interested in do the exact same thing to me.
You can absolutely get a black eye from a door, especially if she was hit by the corner of the door. I got one as a kid when I would run at a door in the house that almost never latched to push it open, well my sister opened it at the wrong time and I hit my head and eye against it. Had a bump on my head AND a black eye lmao
Any one else notice that it say not a stalker for Xbox girl
Bro I love how you dress up just for us that hat is amazing
how high was that doorknob
Swoozie gives the best life advice I have ever gotten
I love his longer uploads
Issa great day when swoozie uploads
!! *know your value and add tax* !!
It might be the door knob that hit her giving her a black eye happened to me before
As a social worker, im here to tell u. Unfortunately there is nothing you can do. She’s the one who needs to make the decision to leave him, only thing you can do is give support and at best, minimize risk and damage. She’s started to drift away and I guess there’s nothing you can do, you offered her 2 months in an apt to start over- what more is there? It almost feels like she wants to be with him and ultimately she is an adult and that’s her choice
"Know your value and add tax" is one of the best quotes I've ever heard
Shoulda let her live wit u my boy 😂
Swoozie’s storytelling skills are amazing
i love how swoozie always speaks fax
“Know your value, and add tax” literally I need it on a poster lmao
who are the guys in the paris shirt you’re wearing?
bro why i sound like Ann.😭😭
A lot of women who act like her were probably raised in dysfunctional households and don't actually know what it's like to feel loved or respected, let alone safe. You feel comfortable in what you know, and if you're comfortable being abused, it's difficult to leave. That's why it's so difficult for people to get out of some toxic situations.  I saw a "nice" guy in the comments who said women like being abused, so I figured I should say something.
Lmao that Eddie Monster Cameo
the add tax killed me
This isn't Hafu or anything right?
i love you so much and your videos they are the best i hope to see more
Nice
The only way to get a black eye from a door is the corner or a doorknob. Also, if he was chasing her, he for sure intended to hit her: he wasn’t gonna catch her and scold her
Swoozie  the whole 😲 WOW
Why is the headboard over the window 😡😡😡😡.
Swoozie has such a big heart🥺 bless him
The real question is what race was she
Remember: The better person you'll find over that toxic dude is you, your freedom and your self love.
YES HE UPLODED LES GOOOOOO
Hey swoozie.. I want to preface by saying, I love your videos, I’ve been subbed for years now.. and out of nowhere it just hit me… I don’t remember a video where you say ‘I hit her up’ all the stories you tell are about you getting hit up by all these fantastic woman.. you sound and act like a really nice guy.. but I’m starting to realize you’re also really proud, it sounds like you don’t make effort to hit someone else up and put yourself out there.. not sure how much longer you can keep that up, it’s kinda dickish to be that entitled IMO. it be refreshing to hear when you made a solid effort that either rewarded you with something fruitful or fail (that makes us human). Idk man give it some thought.. just sounds like you should actually try a bit and not just wait for attention from the 100’s of girls who put themselves out there for you.
Bro my best friends sister moved out of her house to live with her bf that was living with his parents too😂
Why you shouldn't give friends relationship advice epilog.
Sounds like a dumb person
damn swoozie loving these videos lately they’re great
Hey sWooZie big fan love the content always. Here from Jamaica XD
Should've never spoke to Bob dude....
I love those kind of videos where advice and stories come together ❤️😭
"Know your value... and add tax."  Yes, exactly. Love that.
I’ve been hit by a door 🚪 before and I’m black eye free
Yeah very wrong my friend got a bruise from someone throwing a water bottle at them
this video is something I could have used about 8 months ago. I just got out of a toxic relationship about a month and a half ago. and let me just say that took a shit load of conivincing myself and guts to tell her that we had to break up. she still contacts me about how "she never did anything to me" and how "she loved me" and how "i lie all the time about her being toxic"
The the long videos for me 😍 love you king!
That girl seems like she likes shitty dudes.. Y didnt you make a move swozz?? you playin...
Bob is trying
Completely agree! You should be whole by yourself. Anybody that comes into your life should only add to that.
Great video swoozie
We wanted the other thumbnail
5:41 I love it when he says this girl body was gorgeous but the drawing is just a box figure with a lump 😂😂
"I'll get out of your hair in 30 days"  Hair? Swoozie's bald
She go be in a toxic relationship 😗🙃🙃🙃🙃. Damn they got married, I hope that she finds what she is looking for and......just probably just get her mind set straight.
😏😏😏😏 yay new upload🥰🥰🥰💯
That's not toxic. That's ABUSE.   This girl had an out, but instead married her abuser.....
all i have to say is "wow"
doesn’t matter how much they’re are fine or no you should’ve been better than those moves man
“Know your value … and add tax.” PERIODT 🦋🦋
According to Schopenhauer, what keeps us motivated to maintain our continual pursuit of desires and goals, is the belief that upon satiating our desires and achieving our goals we will rid ourselves of our suffering and attain happiness and lasting satisfaction.
No it wasn’t the door
"Know your value, and add tax." - Swoozie 2021. PERIOTT. words to live by.
Yo ong swoozie the only person who can where a fedora and not make it weird
Almost every girl friend I had was in some kind of toxic relationship and I was the person they come to for advice and just to vent. They always appreciated it, they ask me why I’m single, and then they go back to what I told them not to do smh. Only a few of them actually listened to me and they did better with their love life and themselves. Although I will say that a few of them too show me “appreciation” too that I didn’t ask for, but I wasn’t going to say no lol
14:07 - 14:20 is literally what I will remind myself when I start dating! Have you considered being a life coach?😇🥰
Anne munition?
You genuinely give better life advice than literally every education system with your ms Paint animations.  I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing but love the content regardless,
much love from trinidad ❤❤
I didn’t even know I needed this😳
You're outfit is giving me gypsy pimp vibes....
That's your accountabilibuddy!!
Spicy hat bro
I just broke up with a toxic girl last night and was wondering if it was right because she was heart broken but after seeing this i feel better about it
Thank you swoozie your right you can't depend on somebody else to make you happy or be your happiness you gotta be happy and love yourself before you love someone else
Swooz that hat is terrible I’m sorry
Let's Go!🙌
"Add value and add tax" dang! Great phrase 👏  I hope that girl will be okay
toxic af
Its elementary my dear watson.. .. Weve found Ann
Hi
Is it me or swoozie tells us so much about his life we feel like were his best friends and hang out with every once or twice every month *AKA video*
If someone doesn’t treat you right, MOVE ON! At the same time don’t feel entitled towards certain things & be mature enough to give people space to grow. At the same time, if someone’s not willing to emphasize or recognize & amend their mistakes they’re not the person to be with!!
Swoozie back
A door actually can give you a black eye. I’ve gotten one from running into a door before
I was watching the video sitting on my bed when he threw himself down and said “bruh” I did that exact same thing at the same time🤯🤯😱😂
Sounds like she was trying to spouse you.
Omg Swoozie! 🤦This is why you’re still single! Girl is basically throwing her self on you and you still have a problem! Stop looking for problems in a girl, everyone has them! Also as a friend, you should’ve let her stay at your house, it’s what friends do. You said you would help her with anything she needed and you didn’t do the one thing she was asking you for. This is why the girls always get away, you way too damn long. Stop being afraid of commitment and just make one of these girls your girlfriend!
Poor girl =/
This isn't just a toxic relationship, it is downright abusive!
I think she was the exact type for swoozy. A clingy person who loves hard.
SWOOZ, that chess analogy you use… my mom’s boyfriend told me the exact same thing and now he owns a company in the Philippines, San Fran, LA and Seattle, and they’re opening up a bar soon…. That’s freaking insanely cool😭🔥
Swoozie please  be my dad my mom is 44
i would talk about toxic relationships, if i were in one DX
I've actually gotten a black eye from a door my brother kicked it into my face but I have glasses and they bent into my eye I think that's how I got it but I think it's possible 😂
Codependency is really my virtual friends. Sometimes or some ppl don't mind removing choice out of their life and pull/draw over bearing individuals into their cycle to be able to live out that life.
My mom got a black eye from a sailing boat (I guess the bar), so it should be possible to get one from a door.  "How clingy she got after the first day we hang out". *how clingy she got after we made out a lot for the first time" sounds more accurate to access the situation lol
In scenarios like this all you can do is just sit back and pray, Jesus let them let you help them
The drip
12:55 I can relate so HEAVY Brotha wit some of my Girl Friends I try to help them out but it’s like it goes through one Ear out the other. I’ve learned as a Friend you can only do but so much the other person has to find there own way
At around 7:50 ish, your bottleneck explanation was very good. I'm on the autistic spectrum and often have a hard time grasping human interaction and emotional expression; your example is more helpful to me than words could ever be.
I literally yelled "OH SHIT" when you mentioned black eye. Maaaaan OMEGA toxic man
8:55 yes, a door can give you a black eye. one time I was trying to scare my friend by hiding right by a door and he kicked the door and I had a bruise on my eyebrow for almost 2 months
thank you swoozie i needed this
Horss Dat pick me or yuh famiily ting had me Dead
an absolute guru on life.... keep on spreading this wisdom homie
I'm not religious, but Swoozie makes me think that not only are guardian angels real, but they're on YouTube 😊
I was in a toxic relationship for almost 2 years it was insidious. Leaving is ironically the hardest thing to do but when I tell you your life will be a billion times better without them. LEAVE
B_O_B will get his friend request
I’m loving these longer videos, plus the topics are very relatable rn. Really needed this!
Well spoken on the bottle theory
Love the videos swoozie keep it up man
B_O_B will get his friend request
lol “I’ll never find anyone better if he leaves me”
Supposedly the gaming community is much closer to 50/50
"Know your value, and add tax" I love that so much, I want it on a t-shirt!
This hits hard and familiar because I've been that friend they go to for support, but somehow they always end up in the same toxic relationship. So I put down my phone and was like "This it too much they won't listen and if they won't listen to my advice because they don't like it then I'm done, I tried, I hope they can be happy eventually."
I haven’t known a door to give a black eye but it can sure give you a knot on the forehead 😂
This man has never swung open a door towards himself in the wrong direction and have the corner of the door hit their face
bro said club penguin
It’s like swooz is the replacement for my dad who never gave me relationship advice
I was in a toxic relationship in which I was the toxic one and after we broke up cause I cheated I changed completely and now me and her are really good right now and I’m working my way up to her giving me another chance because she’s amazing and I’m in love with her
"Know you value and add tax" love this saying
not only was this video entertaining, it taught me around 3-4 life lessons. LOVE YOU SWOOOZZZ
Lmao doors can give you black eyes so I gots a story I was at a sleepover and we where playing hide and seek and I hid with one of my friends and the seeker finds us and we start running to her bathroom and when I think the coast is I was about to leave but she opened the door and I was right there it smacked me in the face and I got a black eye soooo yah
Don’t we all know a woman who is in this situation? Lol the one I know got engaged and they’ve been living together for years now. I think she’s a masochist
So like,  do these girls you make videos about ever see these videos and respond to you?
Add tax😂😂😂🤣
Always thrilled to see you come up in my notifications!
If by any chance someone has her Ig...i gatta see her 😂
its been 4 years!! that is WIFE!!
100$
"And add tax" Yes. sir.
Really! i wish a girl would give me the me or your family ultimatum!!!!
Swooz u claim u a gamer but i never heard you say poggers
Yeah i doors could definitely give u a black eye lmfao
Damn Swoozie pay my rent
Fun fact...... (its sssniperwolf)😥😢😭😭😭😭😭 I have a gut feeling guys🥺🥺
Bro swoozie might aswell be my therapist
Swoozie I can’t even put in to words how much everything you just hit home for me thank you for making feel sane
Respectfully you don’t get clingy from making out… we know what u did swoozie 😂😂
ahh shit is this a sign
So... You f*..* her!  😉
Personally i would call police on him for domestic violence
He has completely run out of content how he has a platform is a mystery
Bro you coulda wifey’d her up and saved her from that 😭😭
If you were going to be hit by a door and get a black eye, it’s probably by the handle.
Swooize ain’t about that thug life anymore, he trying to cook up 14-15 minute videos for the audience no lies.
Seeing people in toxic relationships settle for less is the most infuriating thing. People that treat their SO like that are utter scum.
doors are a mysterious creatures >_<  who knows what kinda powers they have
your videos are always a banger
This guy on TikTok Swoozie6 is stealing your content
11:41 .... she have a really big heart and didnt deserve this .... ive never facepalmed myself so hard before
Ahh I loves another good life lesson from Swoozie😎
. . .        wow
Damn my nigga swoozie came in dripped out.
Hey man just want to say it depends on how hard he kicked it
my bestie just got out of a rs,, and istg his ex is just...so manipulative. im so happy he's finally out 😭😭
She said I was the one being toxic when she was the one gaslighting most of the times and keeping secrets from me🚶🏽‍♂️
i figured it out, relationships where you are spending a lot of time together and rushing everything are shorter, while the relationships where you plan when to take each step and see each other occasionally are the longer lasting ones.
This video is without a doubt my favorite video of yours (to this day). Thank you!
If I was in your shoes swooz, I would’ve let Ann stay at my place. With a good heart like yours, you would’ve been temporarily satisfied at least
I’m okay with these 15 minute stories
Sounds like my friend. Married to someone who is toxic. Wants to leave but too scared, or in my opinion, locked in so tight they won’t move. He has spoken.
Swoozie fumbled the bag HARD
I was about to watch this but imma save this for tonight
And add tax!!!
I come for the life advice:)
I get the portion control
Not going to lie Swoozie usually when you tell stories you show your intelligence but this time you decided to tell a story where every time you woke up & made a decision after waking up & choseing incompetence
This sounds like 90 day fiance
What happened to the music during these stories? Still great video, just curious
Yes just yes
yes! toxic relationship are hard to leave but i love the advice you just gave us at the end of the video. i was in a toxic relationship recently.
Warning anyone with a patience level of 0 do not read this you've been warned: Not tryna prove im smart or anything but to answer your question it's technically possible for the door to give her a black eye but at the same time a ordinary kick or shove wouldn't do it so her ex must have kicked it REALLY hard to give her a black eye. Not trying to say she's a liar but A) it's still kinda hard to get a black eye from a door going by all kinds of things a person would if they saw it coming and B).you never know when someone is lying you never know what some people think they have to do for something  especially going based off of the title of the vid
So ik it doesn’t make any sense but the only time i had a black eye it was from hitting a hard wood floor with my face,…but her excuse in context is still super sus
I just helped a friend out of a 5 year toxic relationship and let me tell you when you said "they got married" I literally SCREAMED in disgust. Like HHOOOO boy that was almost my best friend of 10 years. I'm- HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
"She's the center of attention, every dude here is like simping hard over her."  Samsung Sam and Lady Dimitrescu: *First time?*
My manz is speaking straight wisdom, thank you 🙏🏿 Self-awareness is so crucial in life, but it’s kinda hard to see your own faults and recognize when you’re the problem, especially since it’s so easy to judge others.
Wooooow
Simping Swoozie Smh
weird story
FELT ATTACKED, but glad im out the relationship now lolololol
I’m sorry but she must have been really desperate or extremely lonely if she isn’t strong enough to make better decisions  or smart enough to know what’s right or wrong.
Thank you dude
Swoozie dropping that consistent heat
Bro shorty is crazy leave her😂😭
Maybe I’m wrong for thinking this but at some point I would have had to put my foot down because they have shown that they can’t handle the situation as they are allowing this person to control they life and constantly defending them when they are in the wrong. I couldn’t sit and watch that happen while thinking that “She’s a grown woman and capable of making her own decisions”(No Shade just quoting). I understand all of your reasoning sWooZie I just couldn’t let them destroy themselves when I’m capable of forcing their mind in a better direction. Sure I’ll have to play parent for awhile but eventually if I’m constantly telling them to not do this to themselves and not every partner they get is an angel there won’t be anytime for their toxic partner to manipulate them into throwing away their lives for scum. But maybe there’s more to the story or it hasn’t concluded yet anyway that’s just my take on the matter. I’m just looking at this situation from a high schooler going into college so maybe there are more factors that I’m not aware about if so let me know.
Wasn’t a damn door I’ve taken mad doors to the face never got a black eye
Great video 🔥🔥💯💪
Swoozie? *SWOOZIE THE PLATYPUS??*
Honestly I can't wait till you find a long term girlfriend
Im gonna guess the xbox gamertag is CrystalAnn87?
Swoozie:we make out a lot Me: Correction sir, YOU make out a lot I been here fa like 3 years Ik this
"sends to sister"
Sounds about right.
The "wow"s lmao
I can relate to the “trying to help a friend outta a bad situation” part of it. Got a friend who’s stuck at his abusive parents house. His friends n I have been trying to help him get out but he won’t accept our help. He’s also 2 hours away so it’s even harder. He’s stuck in a toxic mindset and I feel so bad for him 😞
I can confirm you can get a black eye from a door hitting you!! ….. because I did it to my sister in a fight when we were kids
Why the fedora tho Swooz
Damn I was holding out for a happy ending instead I finished the video feeling depressed
That was a very good Chess move decision you made with offering to pay for a months rent. Hopefully things work out for the young lady. Very wise words at the end of this video as well!
That dude isn't just toxic, he's already earned MULTIPLE criminal charges. That includes his family too! :O
what's really toxic/crazy, is she probably made up that whole story just to manipulate you and take her... crazy
Yes sWooZie someone broke there nose by hitting a door so u can prob get a black eye from a door but do not always believe your fans for what they say
swoozie
Y E S
Can’t wait for the update on this vid.
I just got my best friend back because her ex didn’t want her talking to me
I think the door handle could have gave her a black eye
That paris shirt heat fr fr
Hey sWooZie what happened to ur hand/finger???
imagine having to get a girl drunk to make out with her
Swoozie has that swag
"Know your value, and add tax"   BARS
This just happened to me broo. This girl i was with was flipping out cause I didn't respond for less than 20 min and had her mom call my mom to see what I'm doing and why I'm not responding.. I was scared ash
Reminder: women can be abusers, too. If you are someone who presents masculine and are dating a girl who is an abuser, you are not weak. You can leave. you are not expected to be "strong" about it. Get out and stay safe. Edit: if you abuse someone physically, mentally, verbally, or emotionally, you are the weak one and you will never be strong or deserving of respect.
Hey swoozie can I get a "happy pride month"?
Who else is friend asked how do you know so much about relationships without being in one yourself
I feel like she could be lying for sympathy or maybe she needs help he could become domestcally violent
Swoozie what happen to your eyebrow?
When sWoozie said “humans don’t have flat faces”    I had to test the door black eye theory      It’s not possible 😶
Swoozie looks like Chris Paul ngl
manipulation, pathological liars
This is funny natural and relatable.  Some one tell Alex Clark I feel bad for the guy but he is wondering why his channel is dying and thats exactly why. His humor is forced.
A great way to get someone you love to leave a toxic relationship is to leave the door open for support and to start doing activities/hanging out with them so that they realize that they are loved outside of the relationship and that it really I just their partner that is the problem. Helps them realize gaslighting etc.
Give us these regular uploads man
Swooz, and what if the couple has been married for over 20 years and they have a child and the father keeps doing wrong things and the mother just won't leave him 😬 ( it happened to one of my friend's parents, it totally isn't me *sniff*)
The 1 month rent idea was inspirational
Hey, so it is possible to get a black eye if not hit directly in the eye. Someone i follow on tiktok was hit in the forehead and she got a black eye. We've got really sensitive blood vessels near our eyes and they can rupture from trauma that's too close to them.
Woooow....
gotta be in a relationship first 😭
lol was surprised I wasn't already subscribed.
Jesus Christ as I’m looking at this video this is SOOOO RELATABLE talk to these people Swooze!!!!!
I have friends who had boyfriends like this and I dated some toxic men.
Her Only flaw is her being stupid lol🥴
These new videos are pimping y’all
Immediately stopped watching my show and put this on my TV when I saw you posted. Swoozie's videos take priority over anything else I am watching
This broad is a goofball.
well put
Swoozie you never showed us your editing set up bro
Unpopular opinions sometimes his family is the toxic one
ʷ ᵒ ʷ
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHO THE GIRL IS
That chess move was expert mode
Man this is such a tough one. Hope that girl is doing alright! Great advice and storytelling from Swoozie as always
He must be short on funds .. he did not put out the same kinda of animation. This was a little bit on the budget side I like your stuff . Hopefully you get back to the good stuff
wow, thanks swooze
Door knob?
8:03 well u waited a whole month my gu- “They moved in together” Aight my bad, go on.
THE COUNTER IS SOOOOOOO GOOD
❤️❤️❤️❤️
You and jaiden are my relationship guides
When Swoozie drops  it’s a good day
At this point i think im single cause im not toxic or cray cray  🤣🤣🤦🏽‍♀️ ... i think guys my age are just use to it ..  Swoozie you should do a summer bachelor thing  .. who beats you at a game wins a date with you ... think about it 🤣
Swoozie there's nothing on wypedia about doors get you a black eye.
Swoozie I gotta tell you my story so my guy friend was in a toxic relationship with this girl and she wouldn’t let him see his friends or even talk to his friends or hang out and they been together for 8 months and when they broke up he found out she cheated on him with one of his old friends. I have been in toxic relationships before and I have been toxic before but I stopped that cause it ain’t right. I hope your doing well Swoozie maybe respond and we can become friends you are an awesome honest good guy 😎
it can doors can put alot of pressure on your eye and alot of power
Is she me? Did we meet in another life? 🧐 I've been in her shoes before. Big hearted people really do tend to cling to the wrong people for a while until they find themselves for real, for real.
waz not the door bro
That's seems like a pretty normal relationship to me
We all should remember this bro
plot twist she is the toxic one
boy have i seen a lot of toxic girls lot of them if you don't buy them stuff they break up with you i remember i had one where she would date me if i stop being Christian last time i heard from her she wanted me to lose weight but in a stupid way  which i did not take seriously where it would be impossible way gave me a year months before the year she claim that she came back one last time and told me neverminded and i lied just to see what would happen if i did do it then she wanted me to weight 100 pounds lol but didn't matter since i never heard from her again.  another girl glad i did not go out with but i may have been next in line for her was dating a guy im guessing she made him buy all sort of things boy i bet you he made a mistake when he got her pregnant now she single i bet he now has to pay child support.
That dude hit her because when people get hit especially girls or kids they say that the door hit them or they ran into a door or something like that
Yo.  I'm down for a game a chess if you're down.
Uhhhhhh swooz I was in the exact same situation with Anne and my friend kicked the door and the edge of the door smacked me in the eye and it was definitely a black eye.  If the flat part of the door hits you it will give you a bloody nose but any corner or sharp edge hits you can give you a black eye.  So she might not be cappin but ask for details about it.  Much love from Ollie oh and btw P.F Chang’s or burgers never say die?
Man I wish I would’ve seen this 2 years ago lmao
Practically this whole video I was trying to figure out his bandaid print.
If im correct, a door can also come with a door knob. The door knob of the door could have been the one to cause the black eye, but ye....
Couldn't she have been lying to you about all her drama? Some people like to play the victim to get guys(or girls) to fall for them and do stuff for them... IDK  Someone offering to get me a place rent free for two months and I'm in that toxic relationship, bet I'm there.
Dang kinda felt dis🥺
This video was great but don’t let that take away from swoozies big baller play of offering rent FOR TWO MONTHS 😎😎😎😎
Women*
Girls*
From time she got the black eye she should hv been gone....she beyond clingey 😭
I totally relate to Ann.. minus the intense gaming, kissing, drinking and I didn’t turn around but looked up at the elevator 😅 also yes, doors can cause damage. Dude.. one thing is, she was being honest about her feelings even if the bottle felt overwhelming. She would’ve done anything for you.. 😔 an open heart is vulnerable to chaos
looking good just to talk about life also  good job
I was cringing throughout the majority of this video.
This man seriously rocking a thimble on his index?
*Dooooooom nyuuuuuuum nyuuuuuum nyuuuuuuuum*
Thats a tall a$$ doorknob she got hit by @swoozie
Such a good video
No homo but swooz is a beautiful specimen of a man...how he isn't a model is beyond me😂
It might've been the door knob that gave her the black eye.
Early
God loves us!! get right with him John 3:16 with out him we will perish romans 6:23🤍
The "wow" in this video were so loud 😂😂
The camera angle whenever he says wow is downright amazing😂
Yes indeed you can get a black eye from hitting a flat surface I’ve gotten one from a collision on a wall
Swoozie even though she was clingy you should of let her stay with you , You could of said Hey Ann I like you but lets take things slow ease up on the romance stuff you don't want to be so clingy that you suffocate your POI a long lasting relationship takes time to build so take the time to get to know eachother and enjoy eachothers company by hanging out going to a movie communicate and be clear about what you want in the relationship be open honest with eachother both people in the relationship can set healthy boundaries but most importantly you need to have trust for the relationship to grow being in a relationship without trust is like being in a car without gas you can sit in it all you want but you will never get anywhere
Some girls want toxic guys now for some unknown reason
Swoozie out here blessing us today 🥺🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️ The outfit tho yes 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 How I miss looking for the mystery links
That bottle analogy is great!
This guy is a GENIUS
ive gotten a black eye from a door before, but it was from the handle not the door itself... i dunno if that is possible swooz
Not going to lie I just  want  swoozie to be  uncensored  in one of his vids  like just straight savage  and not giving a dam
When sWooZie post a vid. 🤯
Toxic by Britney Spears 😁
Damn swoozie right in my feelers
Brewstew and SwooZie post on the same day? It must be the second coming of Christ!
8:49 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Yeah true last I checked no flat faces here
This is so sad.....   Actually tho. That's bs. So many toxic and unhealthy relationships in both the statistics and in our everyday lives.
Swoozie is like free therapy lol 😂
4 years? Ya'll waited 4 years..?
I will say that unless she was bending down and slamming the door, the door handle would probably hit her chest or stomach unless she was super short.
POV: Your single but use his relationship videos as advice
I get the feeling like it’s the Ann from TikTok or I’m just waffling
Ma dove l'ha presa l'acqua panna pensavo non la vendessero più!!😲
What's a one piece skirt? Lol.. A skirts a skirt
I feel like Swoozie missed his dream girl. She could have been sat down and told that she was being too clingy, and that he still liked her a lot but she needed to chill instead of ghosting her (although ghosting people isn't wrong per see) and they could have worked that besides. At least- that's what it seems like. I hope the guy she ended up marrying became a better man.
If you get close to your girl and she pulls back, you know Rachel's hitting it. If you want to play the field, be Rachel (watch the video)
she lost this chess game
Legit those last 20 seconds if the video was just me nodding my head while thinking about my ex 😂😂😂
Any time the fedora hat comes out. You know SHITS about to get DEEP.
SMH Swoozie Xbox🤦🏾‍♂️
My last relationship was.... uh... this is awkward... I never had one
Know your value and add snacks!  I like the sound of snacks.  *rewatches the end*  Oh add tax...not snacks
Swoozie yes doors can give you a black eye.
I'm 100% stealing the bottle analogy 😂
Sometimes I forget Swoozie is like twice my age 😅 but good advice as always, definitely helps ✨
YES IVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG FOR THIS
A Tonee TonEe ChoPpa
BoKu WA DOCTA
One piece?!?!!
0% chance their relationship is not toxic. It had a toxic foundation.
Swoozie! You are such a King! You deserve an AMAZING companion! I feel like I think this every video I watch of yours.
Know your value .... and ADD tax! - sWooZie  OMG I'm dead x_x
Hell yea let her come
That bottle like explanation was amazing btw
Is the girl sniper wolf?
I had a similar thing. I talked to this girl for a bit and then she randomly got back with her ex. She kept complaining to me about her relationship but I didn’t rly want to criticise the guy, since I knew that she was gonna crawl back to me and I would’ve felt real guilty.
I got hit in the face with a metal locker room door before. I got a big goose egg bruise on my forehead but not a black eye. And the place where the door hit me was in a vertical line going across my eye. So it never hit my eye
Highkey one of his best storytimes and I’m saying that as somebody who was watching back in 2012
I could sit here watching Swoozie for hours on hours and feel fine.
Get happy first and then get into a relationship. It shouldn't be the reason for your happiness. I've always said that, great advice. Hopefully people listen to you because I can never get through 😅
"woooooow" XD
She was lying Swoozie…..She was 100% lying
Omgggggggg she declined that deal?!?!?!?!
"I've been in a toxic relationship once or thrice" --sWooZie 2021 13:44
A door can give you a black eye long funny story😅
every time this man uploads its like christmas
3:19 "She's got a huge..."
I know one of you detectives knows who she was go ahead n tell me
Last time I was hit by a door, Mt Everest formed on my forehead. The way I see it....  Anything can happen
I like that Swoozie always looks sooooo fly when he does a story time.
I liked this girl during High School she was chunky & she had a nice body but her boyfriend was Letting people make fun of her because she was chunky and then he makes fun of her himself she texts me she said she wants to be with me & doesn't want to be with him but then he was planning to get her pregnant he gets her pregnant and now they're married he was toxic to her and now I just don't know I still like her but she doesn't text me back so I'm just living life being single and hurt because I fell for her so hard 😭😭
She was too clingy but yet you keep answering her phone calls for over a year?  Sounds simp fam
Speaking truth into the zeitgeist, friend.   For those of you on the fence, the grass is not only greener, but it's true, healthy vegetation vs the inauthentic AstroTurf the toxic counterpart is selling as organic.   Until y'alls' names are on that dotted line and y'all exchange "I Do"s, you can ALWAYS back out!!   I broke a 2 year long serious relationship with half that being engaged before I realized how bad my situation was...  And I had that thing with the engagement pulling me back like I was already committed or too late.  It's not.  Even after the white dress and honeymoon, there is always an out.  Look out for yourself.  There are loved ones waiting for you to come to your senses and to return to open arms, people.   Most expensive lesson I've ever learned, but a priceless education was taught.
Yea doors can give ppl black eyes cause my sister has got one before
She wanted to be friends with bennies, why did you not bring her to your place for that month?? Das ur dream gurl bro! I'm being thirsty for you. You could have saved her
Not only was my first relationship toxic but my most recent last relationship was ruined because the girl I was in a relationship with was in a toxic relationship before our relationship
you help alot thanks
What if Matt was lying?
Does anyone else get frustrated when they hear guys say "men and females" or "dudes and females"? It's dehumanizing...
He not wrong tho…
Just to remember cause im watching this later 5:31
Ill say this you offered her help you did what you could do she declined that was her choice
Love the longer uploads 🙌
my man swooz posted another great vid,I love your videos man
Can't help anyone who doesn't want your help
You know what sWooZie, I really liked the portion control analogy! Thank you!
And that that note at the end of your video that’s the reason why I am subscribed, LOL, I will stay single until it’s right And not by force
Mate got drip
its the fit 4 me
This is so sad to hear but it happens to a lot of people, and no, that "toxicness" otherwise know as violence only escalates especially after marriage. I can't confirm this for her case, but while studying criminology literally all of the domestic violence cases I saw started with small things and slowly got worse over time.
He makes my day 😂😂 that girls is wild bruh
Me: they had a relationship? Also no abusive relationship is funny, be safe and be in control in your own right
swoozie sometimes i be like why would do certain like my brudda like cmon
I can 100% confirm having a door kicked into ur face can give u a black eye. My sister did it to me once when I was 13... That was fun, explaining to all my teenage boy friends how my little 10 year old sister gave me a black eye lol.
Man offered to pay for apartment for this girl for a month in L. A., that is beyond helpful and generous. Girl couldn’t read red flags unfortunately.
“Know your value and add tax” is about to be my new life mantra. Swoozie out here dishing the dinosaur chicken nuggets of wisdom 👌🏽
sWooZie is just the best man😫
Not a huge fan of that thumbnail. See if you can guess why.
I realized how long I haven't watched swoozie😂
a fedora…. INDOORSSSS?!?!?!?!
9:04 either she is really tall or tilted her head in such a way her eye would be hit face first
Wow…This video just helped me figure out I’m toxic-
I so much wanna see what swoozie really means by "she's so fine" "she's gorgeous" "I'm looking for something wrong with her..." he either exaggerates or exaggerates + how comes it takes him YEARS to go out with anyone!! I'd lose interest even if I wasn't interested tbh 😬
A door can give you a black eye. I've done it before by accident at school, in 6th grade.
Bro 3 birthdays and u still was tryna talk to ha💀
I don't know Swoozie I think you fucked up again bro you should have let her move in cause she wanted a man bad.
A door did give me a black eye :/ it was in middle school
Nice fedora
If its you or my family my name bouta be dom toreto
You can definitely get a black eye from a door, bbut then it's gotta hit just right. I'm, talking the edge of the door slamming hard on your face, not the flat surfaces of the door...
|Yeah, we get it, you're a shoulder to cry on.
My first relationship was a toxic relationship 🙃 I didn't see any red flags until after it ended and I looked back at things.
Do you have the best / worst luck I can’t decide lol
Notastalker247   *sus*
Swoozie gives me my monthly dose of self-respect, and I love the guy for it
3:20 “She has a huge… 😳  heart 😮‍💨 “
I saw this post on Reddit where I guy had to choose between his girlfriend and one piece.   He made the right choice.
Dope ass fedora
Kinda rubbed me the wrong way using somebody else’s abusive story as a plot line, and also giving the impression that you don’t believe her
That hat is clean my fam
Babbeeee wake up swoozie uploaded
Swooz I added you on Xbox one time I got P4 let’s play sum bro
In the past I had a best friend, who always went in such relationships  She always got hurt and always gave them a second chance, it changed her totally, to the point were we went different paths.  Such relationships are the worst and you are helpless to change anything about it, it is so sad
A door can give a black eye... And a concussion. The door did not hit me in the eye directly but it hit me in the brow and upper cheek portions of my face. I woke up the next day It went black all around my eye.   Me and my bros we messing around with nerf guns I ran and hid behind a door and my friend slammed it open into my face.
Great day now.
Yup from my experience I ran full speed into a  Valley ball poll. Yes I  Fractured my skull and I had a black eye and no broken teeth. My eye was blood red. So yes a door can give you just that. O if you make out with a lady there heart mostly stay with you. If you tring to date for love I got strong tips  for u
Love you swoozie. Best advice you could give folks. “Know your value and add tax” period.
Swoozie is a Mfing goat my boi
I think you’re still paying that bad karma you got from making out with your friends mom
the worst toxic relationships are always married
I guess I say I'm happy now since I only been doing YouTube for a couple months and I'm not in a relationship yay to me I guess
She has a huge….  ME: ASS Swoozie : HEART    Damn :(
Know your value... and add tax.  Words to live by.
swoozie bro how many relationships and hookups have you had???
Swoozie got me taking notes
I think its possible the door did it if her face was turned at an angle
I thought I would like a clingy girlfriend, until I got a clingy girlfriend (now-ex)
This ending had me facepalm so hard everyone around me heard it 🤦🏽‍♂️
"Get happy first then get into a relatiomship" i will stick this onto my mirror
that girl was definitely the toxic one in the relationship. she was already starting to love bomb you, but you saw that it was sketchy and kept distance so she stopped pursuing.
Swoozie tsk tsk.... she could’ve been the one. You should’ve just gave it a shot 🥲.
When you can’t have your own life that’s the BIGGEST sign, I tell people I’m the most happiest in my life and it’s cause of ME not cause of my girl I love her but she’s not my reason for living
i think this is one of my fav videos of yours swoozie. This entire story can be summed up with one word, "bruh"
Absolutely loved that love bottle analogy Reminded me of my mistakes of coming on too strong with my first relationship  Which inevitably ended with my partner cheating on me 😀
Love the videos man
Another great vid
Yesss it's Swoozie😃
"a few months ago"
A swoozie video yay no sleep for me
Hey swoozie. Longtime fan. To answer your question of can a door black someone's eye is, in my opinion, it probably could but their face would have to be positioned almost perfectly to it. Though honestly, from what you said in the story about her, it sounds like she didn't want to be lonely so she just stayed with him to avoid being single. Also sounds like she had low self esteem to me.
I just recently hit my face on my car door (don‘t ask me how), gave me a black eye.
Turtle,,,,,,.       ,.       ..............   .
Great video, I gotta a friend that still loves my home boy but hates his fiancé to death, I’m talking rage in her eyes.
You have to be taller at hell to get here with the door if not she might have been crouching down while slamming like using her arm and when he kicked it the door handle must have hit it in her in her eye
Swoozie over here speaking straight facts 💯
"be happy first"  my god, why didnt i think of that? im cured!
You had me on the first half Swoozie!!!! I thought she was toxic until you came out and said, "She was in a toxic relationship."
POYO
“Wordddddd..... wowwwwww”
Take a great lesson from this story men.  Women love being abused, taken advantage of, and being treated like garbage.   They would rather be with a broke loser who they are attracted to then a successful man that is a simp for her.
😩💦
Love yourself before you love others 🖤🌸 I love when Swoozie uploads and I happen to be wearing his "cuz Ima thug" shirt 😂
That quote at the end hits different
Is this flights girl?😭
"Know your value....and add tax"
As someone who slammed his head pretty recently against a door I can confirm it can't give you a black eye the most damage it can make is giving you a scar unless she got hit with the thing you use to close the door
Had a similar situation but with a girl that was once my bestfriend.. now we can't even talk to each other cause of her toxic dude smh
Depending
Whoa 2 swoozie vids in only 3 weeks... im so happy😭
sWooZie!!! I’m so proud of you!!! you’ve gotten so much better at your animations good job man!!
Praise God
That was a tough one. I've been there, such a tough situation. How do you help someone in a situation like that
Wow Rip
I just want to know who the girl is? 🤔
no no no no no swoozie let’s just talk
Ohh I needed this- thank youu swoozie
Ya a black eye can happen on edge of the door as it's being flung open
yoswoozi wanted toknowif your ok brohave a goodday bro
Bruh you told her you would pay for two months... wtf is wrong with her 😐you know what she deserves what she get. Damn shame oh well but you did what you could and that her issue
I may still be pretty young but I’ve been in a bit, the deal breaker is when they are just being distant. That’s how you should know something is going wrong, like I did.  And of course when your a couple hundred stages above them
Everything swoozie says is facts
“If we broke up and we never got together again, what guy would I want to be in a relationship with?”  LMFAO. What the…
I lole swoozeie but the same issue as the last time for the love of gd pull the trugger when u get the opeining ralked a month she gping hard take her on date
Explain how not to be toxic or how to stop
Bro you can bring the cow to the water but you can't make it drink
Swoozie is legit the voice of reason that every friend group needs!
Wow......what a story.
Yes the clinginess can be a lot especially when your an adult and your fine being on your own and sometimes your like ok your clingy but also are you clingy in that lets just get on or clingy in that you got issues there are so many layers to a relationship which is why I go with my gut when meeting people. Wow, red flags just everywhere and yeah it can be hard and honestly its best to listen to people who you know care more who where there before that person and to have alone time to see the warning signs.
the last part you said 👏🏾
🤠
The add popped up and I wondered where the story was going then I see the title
“i have to wife this girl” *fast forward four years* “we’re still friends” 💀💀
You could've been happy together. I understand you might not be into the clingy type of girls, but honestly, during these uncertain times, I dig it.  I'm a Gen Z-er who's surrounded by their family, and their neighbors mostly consist of old people, lesbians, and children with only a digit as an age. So for me, especially since I just graduated, a clingy girlfriend is the dream.  But I do get that people might not be into the clingyness since it's smothering, but I feel like this is mostly your L.  If only you got to Ann first before that toxic douche did, not only could you mellow her out, since I know you could, but you could've had this fine gamer girl to marry you!  The thing that I don't understand is, why didn't you add this to your biggest L's video. That's a bigger L than any of the ones you said in that video. Would it be too long?  Also, since this was a problem you knew she had, you probably should've shown her the wine pouring out too much analogy, especially since you guys were drinking and all.
I'm glad I'm not In a relationship and will never think about it 😃👍
ironic, im trying to leave a toxic relationship now but its so hard. thank you swoozie
I have gotten a black eye from a door hitting me but I also wore glasses so the door hit my glasses which hit my eye.
swoozie i love u bro me waiting for u to post is too long :( ik u have huge schegual but ill see u in another month or 2 weeks :) huge fan <3 keep it ip bro
Lol damn, I felt that. Have someone going through that
I found out majority of these the hard way
Yeah all this is fine and dandy but what happened to ur finger?
This girl seem like the type that’s so scared to be alone that she’ll cling on to anybody no matter how horrible they are or how bad they treat her. It’s just sad
This video really got me bro. Thank you so much
My mans speaking fax
...
That end line of "Know your value... and add tax." was perfect
Toxic friends are the worst.😡
Eyo, This katerino and mo, tha facts Line up
My brother's wife told him to choose either his family or her and he picked her and I haven't seen him in almost a decade because of it.
You know he’s serious when he gets the club penguin
Swoozie man did u tell her she was clingy. if it's just that and she has amazing body an personality and face couldn't u go over the clinging. Cmon man u mouth omg and then u frendzoone her I mean correct me if I am wrong   Ps sorry for Grammer and other mistakes
A black eye could be given from a door if you’re at the right angle
12:03 THATS TUFF🤣💯💯 BYE BYE BADDIE 👋
Another amazing video by sWooZie giving advice for like two generations now.
Honestly the whole Toxic this is um…..ya this hits home…..
🐈👈🏿
Swoozie is such a loser
Bro this man is always dripped out just to talk it’s just amazing
@sWooZie You good bro? You have a splint on your right index finger.
Dang. This man's so good looking he was dm first
Damn I really want to know who he's talking about lol
Love the fedora
Anyone else expecting him to just show up in the local bar just passing drinks around with that bowler hat
10:25 my guy if shebis really as bad as you make she seem it👏🏿 don't 👏🏿matter 👏🏿
That final statement about happiness is big facts
I while back swoozie  made a video about a girl who looked like jasmine he said and he’s pfp is Aladdin so does the mean....
Swoozie, when did you meet my ex. You described her perfectly. She took 15 years of my life. In the end it was my own fault. I was an adult that made a bad decision on who to be with out of fear of being alone.
I don’t buy her story about the door but I will say anything that can hit you in the eye can give you a black-eye. And I know a girl who used the same excuse that he was trying to come in ,she locked him out and he pushed the door into her and she got a black-eye. BULL BUTTER!
The scariest toxic situations are “I’ll die without you.”
I just found out my bf is a anti-vaxxer. I hate my life.
Dude! You didn't fight for her. Women want to feel loved....
The scariest toxic situations are “I’ll die without you.”
“Know your value and add tax” Swoozie with wise words
lmao dejavu
my guy is the ceo of good advice
In my first relationship I was the toxic one. For the first few months I was extremely clingy and gave him all these limitations.  I then realized he wasn't happy, so I got better.  Suddenly, he got even more toxic than I would, getting jealous when I would hang out with other friends, regardless of gender (I'm gay btw) and I put a stop to the relationship when he got mad at me and started yelling at me for getting drinks with my best guy friend on my birthday, even though he decided to go to a party without me.  Recently (Like maybe a year ago) I discovered that the entire time he'd been toxic was because he was trying to win back his ex (one of the people I initially asked him to stop talking to) and was taking out his anger and frustrations on me. Last thing he said to me was "Wow, we couldn't even last 2 years" TLDR; I was bad and got better, he lost his self-worth via his ex and took it out on me.
This isn’t her first toxic relationship. She’s so submissive and ok with everything that happened and she is totally getting abused in the marriage
@sWooZie thanks for making this video, I just got out of a bad relationship
Great video man, thanks for all the fun advice that you give
Literally to the 1% who’s reading this, God bless you, stay safe and have a wonderful day.❤️(my dream is to become a famous youtuber) thanks
Who is the girl
Swoozie is like that friend you can always go to for advice. Honestly just saving all these videos in case I need advice on something lol
Swoozie giving me some Patrice o'neal vibes with that fit on.
I understand!!! When guys DM me they are like whatcha doing, how ya doing. 1 hour later the same thing on repeat. Then it goes on for like a week if I don't stop it.
love how you pronounced all the letters in 'holler'
I would've taken that offer
Hello, I'm new to forex trade and I have been making huge losses but recently see a lot of people earning from it.can someone please tell me what I'm doing wrong
That ending was a fucking plot twist in a half wtf 😂😂
A door can give a black eye
A lot of these details match up with a twitch streamer that I watch, kinda sus
I hate these “WOWS” man. Let me FEEL the scenario bra, stuff is distracting.
I really thought she was going to be the toxic one after you talked about the sudden clingyness!
"The portion" thing is nonsesense. Why do you have to match their energy? why cant they match yours? just be yourself, your very clingy self because someone will find that very charming and adorable. Never try to be with someone you have to hide something from or pretend your something else. if it doesnt work out its sad but okay. find someone who likes you for you.
I would’ve her stay ngl
Well flat surfaces can give you a black eye.... it happened to me... but it’s rare... 👀
Haha no tea no shade but the majority of gamers are girls tho
Hello (make this the top comment)
If this happened in England you would have gone over there and slapped that asshole into another reality when you heard she got a black eye. X
Ngl this video kinda didn’t sit right with me Swoozie. Like this girl was in an abusive relationship yeah toxic too but there were so many red flags. I hope she knows you made a video about her because if it were me I’d be really upset about this.
I have slipped and fallen flat on my face where my glasses cut above my eye and I ended up with a black eye so swollen it was pressed against my lenses
Dude, I needed this @sWooZie. I have a friend in a similarly toxic relationship also married to the guy. He never laid hands on her, but what he has done......but she's an adult.
man it feels like my bottle got a hole in it..
While it is true that relationships won't cure your sadness MOST OF THE TIMES, in my case I respectfully disagree. Me and my boyfriend were down in the dumps and could not get out of the slump, however together we supported each other, achieved happiness and have a great relationship - brick by brick, just like you would build a house. Relationships are not *POOF* ERRYTHING IS PERFECTO :D   Also Ann's situation kinda sounds similar to mine up until to the black eye, cheating and blocking other people (cuz bf is not toxic), and we ended up moving out from his parents. Now I'm the happiest and calmest I've ever been, 2,5 years and still going strong.   Also dunno how clingy she was, but like dude... you seem to always express how you want a relationship, shut her down and then.....texting someone once a week is like...wtf :D not even worth the time, and you literally can't build a relationship on that :D Although I apologize for this statement if she was "send 100 texts a day" clingy, had that and did not vibe with it :D  Tho wahmen be weird, my mother has a talent of finding toxic garbage and defending them to the last :D (hence why I kinda ran from home)
swoozie never fails to speak fax
Ooo we must be lucky to get so many videos in 1 month. Ty Swoozie
Swoozie looking fresh with that Fedora on
Personally, I would let her live with me for the month. Mainly because I rather let her live with me and be clingy then to see her get hurt emotionally and physically like that.   Toxic relationships ain't no joke just ask my parents.
Swoozie stories>
Wanna bet a door can’t give a black Eye
I might be a toxic friend with benefits 😔  Edit: I wasn’t, we’re still friends with benefits luckily. Another edit: she was toxic. We started dating and she dubbed me. Tuff
This woman is super hot, a gamer, and is into him, and somehow, Swoozie, somehow, you let her go.        bruuuh
Was I the only one who's like wtf during the while story?
Why do I feel like I've watched this?
The girl used to say that and I be like “then leave!”
A very important one if you can do a video about toxic relationships with parents and their children or adult children. That would be cool
Lol you can’t use pre-recorded  audio to prove that you met on Xbox because the whole premise of the proof is to put the guy on the spot live and have him say Xbox to show there was no conspiracy to  cooperate… Guilty as charged . Lmfao I’m just messin wit ya… But guilty
Toxic breeding toxic, and converting the good ones to the dark side.
All the wows in the video made me laugh so hard bro my roommate thought I was in pain 🤣🤣
Irving: "Sup bro." Swoozie: "I have a quick question for you. Uh how did we meet?" Irving: "Uuuuh, we met through XBOX." Swoozie: "Thank you sir. I won't take up anymore of your time. Holler! *throws phone*"   Too funny. 😆  Real shit, Swoozie really do be speaking the truth. No disputing that. It would be too damn cool to actually meet this dude and hear some of the crazy things that has happened to him or someone he knows all the while somehow still getting some insight into things you may or may not have previously thought about or understood.
Chess.
Swo can u miss plz 😂
You should call this Simp Stories
Nice bandaid swooze
This makes no sense  who the fuck would  decline that offer even if she is living about the situation
Wait Swooz you dont make the animation in the description art by bandit i always thought you made it
Just helped a friend out of a toxic relationship. Thank you for confirming that the moves I made were correct. Checkmate ♟
i saw this and i said to myself wow i can’t wait to b called out
SMH so toxic ☮️❤️ tho
A handsome man in a fedora asking his 7 million fans to give themselves a black eye using only a door.
yet again, another great video
Stuff like this happens way to often and alot of people in these toxic situations feel like they can change / fix  them. Shit is heartbreaking and like you said you can only do so much. I learned a long time ago if im in a relationship if she's not willing to put in the time, effort or treat me with the love or respect I would her im not wasting my time.
And add tax? Bruh we dont have tax here besides very little things 😎
U gave up her club penguin damn u gave up her whole Social 🤣🤣
If she was my friend I would fly to go to her boyfriends house and either punch them or do sum worse that I can't say
Yow my day just got better with this vid bro. Thanks Swoozie 🐐👌
13:30  Tbh that's still better than what could have happened/what I was hoping he didn't say  But c'mon girl-  HuH?!?
Yeap doors don't hand out black eyes ... Fists do in my experience 😉
The door handle could hit her face and give her a black eye
U could say love is water and the glass is u and if u put too much love it’ll all spill out
swooziee swaggy
I love ur videos
I’m sorry for anyone who has been in a bad/toxic relationship. I’ve seen it with friends and my own sisters. I’m 33, been single for my whole life. When I’d see these bad relationships I’d think being single sounds better than being with someone who makes you upset. I waited for God’s best and who he had for me. Now I understand why.
I will never to this day understand people, they’re grown adults but honey, WHY is the question we want answered.
Man, I don’t know why swoozie didn’t make her wifey when she asked to stay with him? Did he have a girl at the time?
"Woow"  lol
Yeeeeeeeah I’m glad you didn’t smash bro
I hope that girl gets some serious help
BRUH MARRIED???!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you goood? if Ann ever watched this video and sees this comment, homegirl get therapy just just just get therapy
I have a literal swoozie play list
Swoozie is a good looking dude. My dude shouldn't be like "little ol me"
Somebody give me a link to Ann. I just want to see. Cause this bottle analogy 😭😭😭
Did u cut ur finger swoozie?
I’ve literally just got through something like this a few months ago
...and add tax 🤣🤣🤣💀
"wow" LMAO that take is perfect
swoozs all I know is simping ain't pimping but I would have done it and let her stay with me.
A door could give you a black eye only if the door has a curve bump exactly on the level of your eyes, so it does happen
swooz i voted for the other thumbnail
Video hasn’t even started and I know it’s gonna be a banger!
Like swoozie I'm very charismatic with chicks. Yet unlike swoozie i speak out. Swoozie is like nah I'ma let her be. Me: look....your man's is fucking crazy. You're dumbass asf for staying with him after all this. I'm down to help you but if you're going to crawl back to him i have no intention to help. If you liked me you should've said something because I would treat you like a queen knowing the fact you'd do all that for just 30 days. Girl do it for life and I'll be loyal asf and marry you after 30 days. The only time I'll be looking at another girl's cheeks is on Mario Kart when peach does flips and twirls. I respect you and you respect me could've been happy for life. Hit me up when you're officially completely single that's what I'll offer you. Love you, Good luck and take care because I'm not dealing with that if we even consider dating and getting married in 30 days" 😂😂😂😂 if she's that fine like swoozie said then fuck it. Clingy part she has to take it down a bit since I need space; in return I'll buy her flowers and DLCs lmao so there is balance.
Swooz!
it could be the door nob
Has swoozie gotten new cameras?
She had no job and is just willing to stay with random people, lets be honest... she always has belonged to the streets.
Swoozie helps me make life decision
Sup 👋
Bruh... this is just depressing  Honestly, I would let her live with me, I honestly don't get it why you didn't say yes first hand.
Swooz, are you a therapist?
Can we talk about swoozie’s drip
swoozie i love u lol
ayee ayyee 13:33 ,I know that feeling 30000% my man
Women never learn.
Once again, it all comes down to proper communication and the lack thereof... *sigh* hate hearing people being abused and noncommittal about facing it....
That dude definitely punched the girl 😬
I LITERALLY NEEDED THIS VIDEO AT THIS POINT IN MY LIFE
Thank you
Funny enough I met some of my best friends in the world online playing games
9:40 "woooaaaw" laughed more than i should😂😂😂
those kinda relationship mostly happen to people with big hearts. They end up losing a bit of that kindness
Word?
Hi swoosh
You the best swoozie
This video should have came out 3 years ago
_Eddie Monster_ 😎👍🏻
She gotta b an Aquarius
best life lesson-giver i know, no cap :D
There are 74 dum people in this world
rae lil black ?
Swoozie is too nice sometimes, I think after the first thing that happened with her and him, I wouldnt help or care, she chose him over swoozie, so why swoozie still cares is beyond me. Shes the dumb one in this situation, and yes she is an adult, so let her figure it out.
Four years ago my my 18 year old son introduced me to your channel because you were fun to watch. He wasn't lying. I am 46 now am I have been following your stories ever since.  Thanks for the videos!
Damn you offered to pay for her entire month and she still blocked you? Wow tf
bro when will you find some true love 😭
Swoozies videos always give me those 2017 summer vibes💯
Swoozie gives such good advice as well as extremely entertaining stories. I'd gladly wait half a year just for a single upload because it's always such a good watch 👍
the worst part about toxic relationships is that they're a blinding and cyclic pattern of events
If anyone wants to get happy hit me up if you know what I mean
Anne: A door hit me in the eye Me: Odd won questions physics.
✨8 years w sWooZie✨  I stated watchin him in 7/8th grade I was 14  lmao I’m 22 now 😫
Honestly I’ve been in a toxic relationship for almost a year now and this gave me a lot of insight thanks Swooz!
Ann: *explains problems* Swoozie: Word? Wow. Also Swoozie: *b r u h*
I get it, clingy ain't for everyone. But I gotta respect this girl. She's not trying to waste her time, she's looking to get wifed up. Gotta know what you want and go for it. I respect that.
The add timing was perfect
Know your value and add tax... Probably the best advice someone can get haha.
Sniper
When at the point you said, "a door can't give you a black eye". It can with many force hitting your head. If I am wrong, someone please correct me. Thank you
Ah yes a video about toxic relationship and I been in toxic relationship before with my ex’s boyfriend’s🥲
I totally meet someone who was a total simp to any girl he meet, but was super mean to men friends who were always nice to him.
FACTS!!!
Eyyyy lil snazzy Fedora
The relationship that you had with this female is just as (if not more so) toxic as her relationship. Cause you get the pleasure of having all of this info dropped on you - but there's nothing you can do about it, except sit and stew. And then there's the whole "he's going to be there to listen when something new happens" aspect. Know your worth. You're better than just a video game and a drive to have it  delivered.
They... got... married. Yikes.
What happened to tour finger?! You ok😭😭?
I needed this
Hey bro... I need you todo a segment on social media and the impact on relationships. Recently my lady left me after finding out she was pregnant because I expressed my concerned about her streaming activities and her followers. She vowed to delete but didn't. Should I let her walk, even with my child...or should I continue to fight for her love and pray for her return? What would you do if your partner chose social media over her relationship?
Know your value, and add tax... Wow, what an ending line.
Thanks swoozie, now Ik what not to do or say to my gf  We’ve been dating for 3 months now and I had trust issues and I was overthinking allot and I was toxic too.   She may be gone or busy most of the time but she says she’s putting effort but can’t do everything at the same time, and I understand that so I’m more calm and patient now. It’ll work out between us.
every word in this vids was nothin but facts👌🏾 "know ur value and add tax" -swoozie 2021
PEOPLE: stop teaching little girls "if he hits you that means he likes you." Some internalize that and wind up in abusive relationships like this
factsssssss 💯
Also that relationship is MORE than toxic, it sounds straight up abusive. Poor girl
You inspired me to make a chanell
On my way to Yosemite bro good timing 😂🔥
Why she get back with him after all he did…..
Waiting for Swoozie to collab with Austin Dunham, Stephiscold, Fitxfearless & Fresh and Fit podcast... it's a simply a matter of time at this rate.
“Know your value and add tax” words I will love by for now on
I hate hearing “you’ll never find someone like me.” That’s the point isn’t it???
My friend is just like your toxic friend Eric. He alwase claims that he isn't the problem. He gave me a scar that I still have and he blamed me, me and my friend who im gonna call Sarah alwase go out of our way to help him with bullies. What does he do in return? Ducking hits us thats what he does. He manipulated my childhood friend hmmmmmmmm dave into being violent just like him. He makes dum excuses like "Oh im gonna play fortnite with so and so cus he's a better gamer than you." Like what a div. And to make it worse he's a teachers pet so if I do anything in return like I dunno slap some scence into him then he'll over react and tell the teacher like a blummin heck snitch. So I just realy want your advice swoozie you seem smart in these situations so please help me.
Yo but can we talk about that portion control analogy?! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Good timing bud. Loved this video
maybe if your face was at a weird angle then yea it is possible to get a black eye from that
Toxic relationship do not stop when they are still together...  For as long as they stay together it will get worse, until they either break up, or worse.   The best bet was to have her live with you and basically separate her from him, block him a ND everything, your goodness maybe would have woken her up but that's a strong maybe, she also would have learned what a good dude is.  But since she's with him, I'm going make an dumb prediction based on witnessing and exp (not me family and friends)  They're married, he will continue to mess her up mentally, Cheat, and probably put hands on her more.  This cycle will repeat for about a year where then he probably gonna convince her to have a kid. And she's going to do it thinking it's going to help (it won't)  She might come around to understand this isn't good in about 5 to 10 Years, and she'll hit you up a shell of herself, with probably 2 or 3 kids   Or he will dump her for one of his newer models(object), and kick her and potentially the kids to the curb
“Relationships should add to your happiness not be the reason for your happiness”
Ma boyyyyy, can I get that fedora  😬🙏
Just help her out and tell the rules you set in your hours and make sure that her broker up with him.
Golden take away: "Know your value, and add tax." -Swoozie Well said sir well said...
Why is your top half bigger
"know your value, and add TAX" !!! sSsaYY iTT lLooUderr FoRR thEE pEOpplE In Thhe bACCK!!
Am I the only one who thinks that Swoozie also made a couple dumb decisions?
I like when he says Woow. 10:2
Lame swoozie shoulda just told her she was coming off too strong she sounds nice
This man straight up drops  Stand Up Story Times
"you either pick me or my family"  Me: 🚪🏃‍♂️
It probably was the door since she claimed it was kicked. When she starts panicking there’s a good chance that she held the door down out of fear and if he kicked it (depending on the strength) it was probably the door. It’s hard for that to happen though since she would have to be in a very awkward position. Edit: at 8:40
i have gotten smacked in the face by a door before and got a black eye it was really painful but most of the damage happened to my nose
a m a z i n g
You know it’s good when it’s a 14 minute video 🙏🙏🔥🔥🔥
I'm sorry, but her whole story was super sus. People that willingly stay with toxic people be the worse to be around because for some reason it starts affecting you.
"It sucks that somebody who so nice and has such a big heart has all this crap happening to her and she's staying in that situation" - swoozie 2021
I got hit with a door once and I did get a small black eye but nothing really big
Love how he’s always talking about both sides 😌
4:49 okay gtg bye! *ad plays* “do you want to get away, and travel the world? Western Australia “ - 💀
What do you mean a few months ago, the toxic friends video is almost a year old
You are too good for this girl, she has self worth issues and it seems you might be a people pleaser…move on and I say keep her married ass at a distance.
She’s crazy lol
A quick story
I need a swoozie “Woooooow” gif 😂😂
It’s not you bro it’s her 😂🤦🏾‍♂️
Toxic relationships can also exist in familial relationships too
Swoozie really da goat.
“Know your value, and add tax”-sWooZie 2021🔥
Bruh it’s so crazy that you dropped this, my home girl has been dealing with this real recently
The silence and the WOWS are immaculate 🥴👌
I have never heard that metaphor before. probably because I don't drink. lol But that is cool. :D
You can trust this man, his fedora has a feather on it
I feel like a door probably could give you a black eye frfr. Not sayin he ain’t hitter but, I’ve hurt myself a lot. ☠️☠️
Hey man!! I love binge watching your vids!!
Anybody else pretend to relate to his videos?
Homie be rockin the dopest hat
You ever making a video about chess? Idk if it would fit your style that well, but I didn’t know you played and it’d be nice to hear you talk about it more!
ALSO very important: 99% of people aren't toxic right off the bat! They'll pretend to be good or show you their best side and then choose to be toxic once they feel they have you locked down, it's called manipulation and it's why so many people feel like they know the person and fall in love with the idea of the person's best self but that's not reality!!
Thanks for the story and lessons Swoozie. Been a fan since ultimate gamer. You're awesome dude!
CAT FISH
Had a friend who was in a toxic relationship for 3 years... it was quarantine where they finally broke off and she was free... that emotion whiplash months after came in waves. She wanted to keep talking to him, but we told her she gotta block his ass. The reason why is because that bastard never gave her the closure she wanted and needed. Which made me realized how horribly manipulative these types of people are and why their exes keep coming back...
It depends on if your family members are assholes or not
sWooZie is one of the best youtubers i have ever watched
The green flags looking hella red rn
All my dating relationships had been toxic lol and so had past friends
13:29 WHAT?! Why?! Also lol sWooZie dropped on the bed 😆
...Who just instantly has a backup person they'd rather be with?! That alone tells me your heart isn't in this relationship. This being said, he was the one who cheated so he really has no room to lay down ground rules about following others online.
Those wows can be memed so hard 🤣
Everyone should have a friend like Bandit... Someone should always know when you doing something sus... Just in case
A near 15 minute video, who dis mans
Love dat u dropped today man tomorrow is my birthday day
Yo but like that bottle analogy was actually pretty creative ngl
"females" Swoozie I've always been a fan but please understand that referring to women as "females" is dehumanizing and doesn't specifically discuss female humans. Females could refer to any female animal. Really makes my skin crawl. Also, commentators don't come for me I'm just giving some insight. I've been a fan for years and still am I just want to inform you from a woman's perspective that knows a lot of women that feel the same way. Just say, women. :) Thanks
The door hit me mmmmm sounds like cap
Hey man I'm kinda feeling the same because this girl was in a relationship then they broke up then me and her became bestfriends but then she would constantly block me she said that she doesn't want to talk because she not in the mood to talk to anyone then also i confessed that i had feeling for her but last night she asked me why am i in love with her and i told her why then after an hour she said im sorry and then blocked on every social media and went into my account deleted the highlights of the times me and her were hanging out and im just heart broken
Woww that crazy 🤣🤣
No no the boyfriend got a point when he said he should block u like bruh if y’all want to make it work and she just said that she want a boyfriend like swoozie it makes sense that has to be to jealous and prob think there is something there which there was it’s n it toxic it’s a boundary bruh
Me realizing I’m toxic 😳
HOW OLD IS THIS MAN.. He goes “four years later she’s at a gaming tournament”…..”I text her every year on her birthday”….. “A FEW BIRTHDAYS GO BY”…..
his "wow" tho
I think you made the wrong decisions by letting her stay with the dude. If I have the feeling he did put hands on her I wouldn’t be comfortable about that. I would’ve let her stay if she became too clingy I would’ve explain to her that she’s becoming too clingy towards me.
it’s the “woooow” for me
why the f are men such visual creatures. all they care is about looks NOT personalities.  i hope all guys like this who only care about looks end up regretting it with some psychotic b*** that almost ends them emotionally
Definitely can get a black eye from a door. Got one in middle school, just gotta be angled right lol
the door could’ve hit her eye if she wasn’t fully facing it like if it hit her left side or right side of the her face but it’s gonna take a bit of force to give her the black yeye
*Know your value and add tax" That's the best sh*t I've heard all day ❤️❤️ much love swoozie
ngl my gut instinct 3/4 the way through this story is that she's a compulsive liar and her whole story was a ruse to get you to let her live with you, turning down that offer for the apartment makes absolutely no sense. And then she magically gets back with him after? sussy
daddy sWooZie is it toxic if u get jelly alot uhh for a friend
First time I disagree, by experience I know a little bit about similar situations (I made the wrong choice by making a lógical choice) she didn't take the offer because in the second scenario you were paying for her, to some women the same as paying her which is not good, this was chance to help her out before tings escalated
Lmbo!!! The silent “ohmygod” took me out!!! Girls do that all the time. Cool to see guys do too lol
Nice
Swoozie whispering wow changed my life for the better
4:45 I see he learned his lesson from that blind Valentine’s Day date 😂 not sticking around for the whole thing just gonna dip in the middle
Who turns down free rent 🤔
A swoozie video after a long day of work is the greatest thing
Ah yes, we got the bottle analogy lecture that he gives his friends, that means we're all officially his friends no matter how confusing that shi was 💀💖
Idk why but I think girls love toxic relationships
SWoozie: "know your value, then add tax."  Me: MOOOODD :)))
I think that the door genuinely hit her, and its kind of the same thing as getting your face slammed into a table. I am talking with experience when I say that getting your face slammed into a table can easily give you a black eye, its kind of just what angle you get hit with.
When Swoozie gets in a relationship he doesn't post on Instagram like: "Hey i'm in a relationship" He waits until the relationship goes down till it hits rock bottom and makes a video about it  One word: "GENIUS"
"Get happy first then get into a relationship...relationships should add to your happiness NOT your reason to happiness"-Swoozie 2021
dood. you should have taken her in. i honestly don't see what was wrong w getting such a wonderful person to live with you. you said: talk about whats wrong in a relationship" so why the fuck did you just TELL her she was being clingy? she suffered a lot and I feel like you lost something that had potential to be amazing. but those are just my honest 2 cents.
This mate is cool
Know your value and add tax. I'm stealing that.😊
Nice video pls continue on making videos this is my only entertainment on YouTube
Sounds like a Netflix series Adande the life
You can't save someone whose unwilling to be saved.  A firefighter can't get a person out of a house that's fighting back.  Smh....
that shit is crazy next thing you know they buy a house move in together have 4 kids and live happily ever after
Yo swoozie, you might not see this but can you do a video about toxic family?
Swooz!!
I got a black eye once when I triped over a hoover cord and went smack into a wall, so yes the door thing is possible.
This video should come with a tip jar
damn i need a swoozi in my life!! ngl i'll listen to every shit that comes outta ur mouth!! this dude a living saint.....U ABOVE US PLS SHOWER YOUR KNOWLEDGE UPON US U ALMIGHTY BEING!!! XD
yes a door can get you a black eye. iv been there done that
Awesome video! I love it! And that guy is super Toxic
Another banger from swoozie
I wonder how she reacts to this video
where my hoodville toxic boys 4 life at?
“BRO THIS GIRL IS CRAZY HELLLPPP MEEE!!!! OK JUST GIVE ME HER CLUB PEGUIN“
I was in a toxic relationship where I did Olympic level mental gymnastics to stay. On the outside it looks so obvious what to do but on the inside I was earning myself some self appointed gold medals... I hope some folks do a double backflip out their TR after this vid!!
Yessir
Such a tough situation wtf he supposed to do
Man that sad that such a nice women got stuff to her that she didn’t deserve
8:58 plot twist: she's Voldemort
This was the advice I needed, but also I have made the decision to just be alone because the heartbreak is not worth it 🥲
HOW DID THEY GET MARRIED?!?!?  Xd.
Soo...as someone who has multiple friends that are that girl...they are the toxic person or at least enjoy it cuz it gives their lives purpose
My ex slammed my head against a wall and I got a black eye
Whoa how long has ne-yo been making videos?
Find her !! Internet detectives go!!
Holy shit, I'm sorry but she's weak minded
The door cant but the handle can just saying
When you see sWooZie has a 15 minute video, you know it's about to be good!!!
Babe wake up a new swoozie vid just dropped
sWooZie is the man for anyone. Listen to him.
Swoozie serving us Robin Hood vibes with the feather in the hat. All I gotta say is THANK YOU
Rip
swooz, i spent some time hitting myself in the face with a door, and from my research, it IS possible to end up with a black eye when hit with the correct door-to-face angle
Had a best mate in an abusive relationship turns out all she needed was someone to tell her leaving was an option and that she had to rip of the bandaid just super sayain
And by a few months I mean almost a year
It definitely was not the door
My nickname is Ann lol
i got like 2 black eyes from doors smh
I wish I had a button where I can rewind swoozie's "wooooow" for when my friends do stupid things.
Swooz.... have you ever used tinder? And if you have do you have any crazy stories/advice to give to your fam base?
sWooZie YOU SHOULD… AND SHALL. Heart THIS coMMEnT! NOOOooOoOoOoooOoOw!
i knew so many people who did shit like this and every time it gave me such a massive headache. especially when they'd ask me for advice and then not listen to but they'd come to me to complain about how their idea didnt work and how they should've listened to me. I just dont bother getting involved with people on that level anymore. i dont let them vent to me about their relationships with anyone. i do not wanna hear it. lol
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🎈
Some people on this app can be creepy. one guy tag me a number .am I stupid to you found out it's a guys number. uhh who are you creepy guys tagging me back hiting on me for a day then stop texting me when I don't give him information whatever. not looking for a bf if a guy tag's me hiting on me but don't tell me how he knows me or heard about me red flags go up trust issues so I ask questions if I don't feel safe bye
This poor girl...
OMGGGGSS YOU POSTED ILYSM
Swoozie is a real one though no cap
Okie so I've gotten a black eye without something hitting my eye and the thing hit me where my eyebrow was and I still got a black eye without something hitting my eye Edit: also I've had this happen to me my friend also had a huge heart but she was unable to see because of her love so he took advantage of that and did not age appropriate stuff and I was in your shoes littlerally speaking and I acted as her support and told her about the huge red flags and she broke up with him and can now she doesn't fall for his gaslighting and I'm proud of her My advice to you is show you're conserns and she'll see hat you're right
Swooz what happened to your hand?
xANGA reference hit me
I was literally thinking WOW when the first wow came in.
4:45
Needed this video a while ago lol
If it hit her upper cheek bone or her eyebrow, it can have a big enough space of impact to cause a black eye-look. It has happened to me... more than I care to admit. Not because of abuse, I'm just a clumsy dumbass.
I understand you famous and stuff but you too cautious man. If I was in your scenario I would have given that girl a chance you said she fine af, and she a gamer why not date her? I would have let her stay with me for a month. Yeah she is in a toxic relationship but you could have saved her.    Also I dated alot of girls I can tell for a fact she was lonely.  She was really ready to love someone. The moment she found someone who kinda gave her what she wanted to was committed to loving whoever that was. Even if they are going to be bad to them the whole time. He's going to keep taking advantage of that poor girl and yes she is also dumb for it but I understand her mindset since I dated a girl like that in the past. Js Swoozie you could have been her husband she obviously wanted to marry you and you didn't catch her hints or want her affection.  At 3:59 you said you wanted to wife her up. Like bro.. I respect you and have all the love for you man but I'm honestly dissapointed this time in you on this one homie.
That quick call with Irving. 🤣🤣 Point made. 💯
Jeez man I love u😥 more now
If I had a dollar every time Swoozie said "I need wife this girl", I could afford YouTube premium. 🤣🤣
I love his reaction to this whole situation 😂 I need friends like him
I would've just taken the place in LA. 12:52 my bf feels the same way about my boss. He's just like WhY WonT You LeAVe.. 🙃 Some days she'll degrade you, & some days she'll build you up so that it hurts more when she degrades you😂 she's done everyone dirty who leaves, so IDK
He definitely hit her
Yo I need a “wooooow” count for how many times Swoozie said it LOL  Edit: and add tax.. yo wooord?! 🤯
Know your value, and add tax.
Those last 30 seconds are the best relationship advise you can give to anyone.
The Club Penguin is the most impotent
In an ideal world toxic relationships wouldn’t happen and if they did the people in them would get out of them immediately, but sadly people are gonna be blind and not see the red flags so I hope the best for Ann honesty but behind that pretty face was an idiot
Now i got a black eye from a gate and its definitely possible. If your in the right position, the speed of the door can really hurt you
Continue to become a better you than yesterday’s you and someday someone will meet you where you are and show you true love!
My best friend is in a toxic relationship, what I do is give her suggestions and get out a list of the pros and cons in all the shit she does, ultimately it's their decision, you can't force em out cause you'd be no better that the asshole/bitch controlling them, just tell em all the good they bring, all the bad they cause and let them figure their own shit out, if they wanna stay, that's their problem not yours
Snooze, why didn't you get her to move into your place? And why do you take so long to keep in touch with these girls that you have a connection with? Talm bout, "I didn't talk to her again for 3 months." Why swoozie? And the major reason why she asked to move in with you specifically is because she wanted to be in a relationship with you anyway. Why u do this swoozie it pains my soul.
A door can give you a black eye, if it hits the edge of your eye. You can also have your orbital bone broken, or eyes that slightly stick out past your eyebrow are suspectable to injury.   Sounds like she got stuck in a bad position, and never got over you. You weren't in a position to feel more for her. She sounds like someone who goes all in, but she needs somebody to be there for her.   You shouldn't white knight for her, if you're not going to be more. Be a friend, or be nothing. She wanted more with you, but you weren't down. It's literally a you issue. She may turn out being the one that got away for you. You're right that she shouldn't haven't settled. But women get easily manipulated, as do men. Relationships get twisted, when you allow others to mess with your emotions.  But be serious Swoozie. You lead her on. You liked her, but weren't into her enough. You kept wanting to care, but were stuck in your little boy feelings. She may have been dealing with previous trauma, and that lead to her making those types of decisions A man has to lift up his partner. Don't just look at what they can do for you. Sounds like she was wife material, and you just let her pass you up for a chump. And you're crying to us about how she settled for a toxic person. This is partially on you. Maybe she was intense about you, because she felt something for you. You didn't say she gave you a Silence of the Lambs vibe, so I can only conclude that you weren't ready. She wanted a more serious connection than you were willing to give. That's it, cut and dry.
Yay new vid
We need more story time with swoozie
Issa gyallis summer😭 that last part I woulda hung up da phone and jus dropped her altogether. Her priorities all over the place🥱
This video is very blind about how toxic and abusive relationships actually are.
swoozies actually everyone’s one mate that helps them out in all thing relationships wise
I’ve never gasped this many times in a sWooZie video this one has to be one of my favorite videos I laugh and it had a crazy plot twist this is a movie in 15 minutes
Repeat after me my friends: Toxic people do not change. Toxic people do not change. Toxic people do not change.  It takes a LOT of effort and counseling to change, even if you're not toxic. But as Swoozie said, they don't see themselves as the problem.  "Get happy first, then get into a relationship" - YES Swoozie! Poor girl is probably in a vicious cycle but choices do have consequences, unfortunately.
Story about a toxic relationship? More like story of how someone in a toxic relationship was simping over Swoozie
True that sir! I’ve had friends I don’t talk anymore coz they’re in toxic stuff. 🙁
I like how he does the Owen Wilson wow!!!
I'm so happy you posted swoozie
That "bruh" hit hard.
I love your videos swooz there so relatable
:)
in the first 30 seconds, i recognized the flags.
Life is chess, you have to anticipate life's next moves. You are the king, your pieces are your choices you make. Shout out for my chess players! 😎♟
snip snip and dippity dip  side note: fire video as always swooz keep it up❤🔥
Yo I followed YEARS ago because you are seriously hilarious but now I’m setting here like . . . “😗 hold up did my comedian just become my life guidance coach” 🤣🤣 Thank you Swoozie you are seriously helping out a dumb young lad.
ik what that feels like
100 % a door could give u a black eye
I was hoping that she left him and not married him 😑 hopefully everything is going alright with her.
Please reply
I have gotten a black eye from a door before. It comes in at the side. Your face (your eyelids, eyebrows, etc) smooshes in until it cant hit no more. Not defending his actions just sharing.
I'm watching on my way back from Vegas
I’ve been watching your videos for years and I love how the content has never lowered in quality
I loved by the end you mention how it’s bad if you feel bad when you’re not in a relationship and that you should feel happy alone first, and then get into a relationship to add to your happiness. I really agree to this. Once you’re done with yourself you know what you’re willing to give and to measure what you willing to receive. That said, I became happy being alone like... 7 years ago? But then, didn’t feel like I wanted a relationship anymore. I think I still don’t. But now, can’t help but to feel I’m too old to be in one. So, Now I’m happy alone, and I don’t need a relationship, but before I had that possibility there, and I now feel it’s gone, so that part makes me bit sad.
Another very important & enjoyable Swoozie video to make your day feel great.  Also I wish you a great day.
There's a possibility that she got hit in the eye with the doorknob, but that's a very specific situation that doesn't happen easily. I think she got hit. Dope vid Swoozie.
It hurts when u hear " Oh u don't know she having a baby" and u like <_>
I can relate to this video a lot just coming out of a toxic relationship and its only when I was out that I noticed that I was in one. Its not a good feeling
Just kept staring at that finger the whole video. Rewinds video. Repeat.
My man mentioned xanga!
The falling bruh got me 😂😂😂
I missed these relationship videos
In an alternate timeline, Swoozie agreed to let Ann move in with him and those 30 days turned into years and they ended up married.   The one who got away!?
Maybe it was the corner of the door but then again that would've been so much worse than a black eye 😂
What?!?!!??!!??🤯 Jumped over the broom, tied the knot,    threw the rice, put a ring on that finger, got hitched and forgot about Mitch.

SaltyPotato6... thats my xbox gamertag incase any *cough* *cough* gamer girls wanna play. guys too I guess ;)
Yk damn well swoozie became a detective that night that  the door hit her face
dang swoozie so smart I’ve got mad respect for this mans but not just about the awesome advice he be giving through his experiences in life but also his values and lifestyle.
hey Swoozie idk if you read these but I have this friend girl who is in to anime as much as I am and I've been thinking of asking her if we could see one together, do you have any tips?
Why does Swoozie have the best  drip even tho hes just in his bedroom?
WoOoW
Black eyes usually happen from a broken nose
Can we talk about how drippy mans is 24/7
Toxic freinds whas my favourite video from you
Ey appreciate the longer videos!
There are two slang proverbs in Turkish; 1- F**ker got loved, lover got f**ked. 2- Camel needs thorn, human needs horn.
Am I the only one who thinks Swoozie's style is 🔥
smoking that BOZO pack gg
"Know your value....and add tax." YO I'm WITH THIS
"Xanga" now that's a name I haven't seen in a long time...
The fact I’ll never use this but I’m still watching this 😭
Soo you should of let her stayed at your place. Her clingyness seemed like small price to pay for her well being and even then once she's out of dodged talk her into getting her own place
This situation has happened to me. It's not the door that gave her the black eye, even if it was an "accident". KNOW 👏YOUR👏 WORTH 👏AND 👏ADD👏 TAX! Thanks Swoozie.
Sorry for saying this but, did you ask at any point "Annie are you ok?"
Not me just watching advice I’ll never need
You should have put a ring on her when you had the chance
A door can give a black eye if the head is in the right place
About getting a black eye from getting hit by a door: since I was small, I have hit one (or both) of my eyebrows on either a cupboard, a door, a gym rib wall, or some other awkwardly placed piece of furniture, by accident. What usually tended to happen is that the bruise started below the eyebrow, but dropped below the eye overnight and looked like a fist punch in the eye. I am fairly certain I would have to had been sleeping standing on my head all night to avoid that happening, and to have the bruise stay above the eye instead of dripping down sub-dermally overnight and find a resting spot below my eyes.
you know it's serious when swoozie doesn't even have any background music
At this point he’s become our therapist.
Wow... Sometimes you just need to hear this from a total stranger on youtube, and I think I needed to hear that. Thank you
You're grandkids are gonna have a blast hearing your stories
I’m think it’s Annemunition
sWooZie: him talking about a girl name Anne Anne: her watching this video like 👁👄👁
"this girls body is crazy, he face is gorgeous" perfectly draw by swoozie to show just how good she looks
The door thing can happen! I got a black eye 🙃 if the door is really hitting you forehead with force (or the doorknob can hit you too). The hole side of the face can be bruised up
Being hit in the nose can cause a black eye Swooze.
Fuck it, just let the girl in and give the situation a chance. Yes it's risky as fuck but what is life without risk. She is 100% playing games tho.  Edit: Nevermind I just heard the part where they just got married 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
"Know your value... and add tax" 😤👏🏼 that is all that needs to be said
I love how Swoozie dresses like it's 2013 but in a cool way. Peak era of life imo no worries
Hi 👋
Man I love when Swoozie post 👏🏿💪🏾
Advice on point! You're the best friend I've never met.
Myself I once walked into an opened door and had kindof a black eye but i also had a line on my eyebrow and down my cheek so yeah pretty sus
Bye
Uh, forget toxic, that's straight up abusive
If she’s 3’6 maybe that door gave her a black eye.
I got a friend, who was drunk and slammed, face first into a door and got a black eye.
I used to be engaged to a guy who would chase me around the house (when I'd asked for space) and once ripped the door off its hinges just to get to me.
Swoozie rocking the fedora I see
Swoozie The Relationship Guru!!
8:58 “A door can’t give you a black eye.”  As someone who has lost a limb due to fighting the door army in the hundred-year war, how dare you.                 (This is a joke, obviously. Don’t take this literally)
I know this might sound rude but I don’t want to waste my money on a girl.
I needed this 🙏 I had the most toxic relationship with a single father and was dumped after 6 years. I put up with cheating while raising his child. Everyone deserves a heathy relationship
Swooz knows a lot bout friends with benefits! Virgin still??? 🤔
Bro your recent videos had came at the perfect time. It’s so weird
I think Girls lie alot in a relationship to cover up for the guy's action(A toxic one). The black eye Ann got might have been an actual blow. She can't just come out straight to swoozie. I've been in a similar situation and I've lied too. Yeah,,, It's pretty much just my opinion
You are going to be an absolutely fantastic father!
"Know your value and add tax"  Wise man
I’m single and I love it
Oof, imo Swoozie… you missed an opportunity. I understand 1,000,000% your laissez-faire approach to others, let people make their own decisions and all, but you have the power to intervene and help people make up their minds. Like you said, there is a line and someone under those constraints may have that line blurred, or isn’t thinking how they normally would. Help others set standards, since you have such a good perspective.   Love you, respect you, and stay pimpin’ never simpin’.
Swoozies first relationship: wow we're going to get married!  Everyone: famous last words...
I dated a girl I had a crush on for almost a year. Everything was perfect about them.. until I dated them. 5 days is what it took for me to run to the highlands and never come back. She was clingy, toxic, hateful towards 90% of my pass times and she wanted me to quit my job that I need to help my parents with our mortgage just so Id have more time to talk to her. I learned all this in 5 days. I only realised that this was bad and I gotta bounce because my Youtube recommendations were.. weirdly and suddenly "You're in a toxic relationship. run." Gotta say, I made the right call.
swoozie we could be cuddling and playing mario kart but I don't look like a model and you didn't answer my dm from like two years ago lol. Big RIP
WHEN SWOOZIE SAID “KNOW YOUR VALUE AND ADD TAX” YESSSSSS!! But im really sad thou. I hope shes doing better in her situation🥺
Bob : hey baby girl :p
homies > gorls
"Oh you didnt hear? they're married now!"  I've never seen someones soul leave out so hard for a moment from a single B R U H
14:07 Best advice you could have given. Hope those needing to hear it can (and do) take it to heart. 😎👍 Also, one tends to appear far more attractive when that is the case.  🌠 *_…The more you know._*
Loving these longer videos, man. Although a shorter video every now and then would be great.   Keep up the good work.
One time i got a black eye from a soccer goal post so i can see a door being possible.
"know your value and add tax" that's gonna stay with me...thank you 💕
Daaaamn Swoozie on a Tuesday
ive had friends in similar situations before and it sucks because as their friend you just feel helpless but there's not much you can do besides offer help and hope they make the right decisions. loosing friends this way is truly the worst
This is the one time I'll listen to a man in a fedora
Dude! You dodged a major bullet with that girl.. I believe you're a very good hearted person and care alot about your people's. You did great this time, but do what you did this time everytime.. God bless and keep that energy up!! One luv bro!!!
14:04 I can relate, all facts...
smhh I needed this 2 years ago😤
Ey Swooz... you didn't mention her height so she could have been hit by the door knob in the face hence the black eye.
I think he answered his own question, people don't have flat faces so if they lean forward the part of your face that sticks out the most will get hit. Depending on the face it could be your eye.
Swoozie b looking like a smooth detective in that fedora😳
Ghost her
I have a feeling that it’s Bella poarch
I wish I had a friend like Swoozie
This portion control technique is dieting 101
Did no one notice swoozie say dudes to refer to men and females to refer to women🤨✋🏽 that just grossed me out🤢 1:50
I feel like this is what happened to the guy I was with who cheated on me with a girl. He got with her, and I wouldn't be surprised if she was the the one who told him to block me on everything.
I will be adding tax from now on!
Know your value and add tax LOL🤣 GREAT ENDING !
Swoozie got that fedora drip
ive been hit in eye with a door and Im guessing its possible for others.
🥰🥰🥰
That def wasn’t cool of the dude but yes a door can give you a black eye😂.  Recently I was working at the bar I work at and one of the cooks jump scared me as I was opening the door to the liquor room, jumped and turned quick and smashed my eye into the door and it swelled up and bled.
I hate when a friend of mine ask me for advice… and then do the complete opposite🤦🏾‍♂️
anne watching this video like 👁👄👁
12:37 bruh I was dead 🤣🤣
Bro my gf had abusive ex and well they broke up and well all I did was support her and well she liked me and I was like wtf and now we’ll Im kinda trapped happily tho and we’ll Im still here trying to help her at any point
u gottta POsT MOree!!!!!!
Do you have any stories about why you either hate or love certain games? Would love to see that!
Sus
Well.. i mean yeah... that hit me a smidge... literally did the same thing to a friend cause of the same situation 🙃 wow..
LoL loved your wow (w0W)
The trickiest parts about these relationships is that never make you think there toxic and pretend those toxic behaviors are normal.
Guru Swoozie una ❤️
The goat is back other than cory
preach the hat. PREACH THE HAT
What is the thought process behind these decisions she is making ? The red flag wasn’t the clingyness man it was the dumbassery 😂
Idk if it’s what happened but saying a ‘door hit me’ or ‘I ran into a door’ is code for someone hurt me. I learned this cause I’m clumsy and actually run into doors and when I mentioned it to a few people they asked how they could help
I'm convinced his timeline doesn't have days or weeks it's straight "I Haven't seen her in a month so then we hungout a year later" lmao unbothered
A door definitely can, i've been hit by many an inanimate object
I'm here kinda early😅😅😅. Been watching since 2015 bro, love from Phoenix
i have a friend who is in a relationship. this girl abuses him, had told him that she used him, took his money, they BROKE UP and then they came back together, and he just lets her step all over him just because he loves her. i wish i could do something but, i cant. and when i confront him about it he just says "it is my relationship she can do whatever she wants." she is even moving away just to stay away from him! it is crazy.  Edit: he now broke up with her
the music is missing.. where tf is the music swoozie??
Swooz 💪🏽🔥
You should conduct an experiment on that black eye, flat face on door theory.😏
This guy is a ladysman like Bruce Wayne but with a Fedora
Poor Swoozie he needs a girl that won't use him or hurt him🥺
Sheeeessh ngl swoozie could be hot irl! for this girl to like him
Being too clingy is toxic, so people, do stay away from it. All in good proportion is key.
That wooooooow tho hit different the last time
Hey man me and my girl have been talking and we feel that you dealt with some bad break ups and you are questioning yourself. If this girl only flaw is being the romantic type and she is having bad luck finding a good man. What are you waiting for! A girl that rare is a good opportunity to not be so much on the opposite end were you try harder for other girls to treat you the same way.
Been here since day 1
Damn it swoozie we chose the bottom thumbnail 😤
Why you telling people my story, except I'm not married and got thrown away from a toxic relationship and he's now dating his Co worker 👀 mean while he would get mad at me for talking to my GAY CO WORKER 👀
Swoozie has stories for days
Swoozy- "...to talk to little ol me" Also swoozy- is a golden Adonis
A friend of mine literally said, "If she leaves me she'll only downgrade." Just this morning. Damn 🤔
Bro, looking at this 3rd party, it's very easy to see how you conplicate your own life
That little "wow" needs to be a gif.
When you've experienced everything mentioned the first 30 seconds of the video...
Dang Swoozie, she sounds great and like she really cared about you. So you think you may be subconsciously trying to find excuses to keep your heart closed up to protect it? I hope once you finally make a decision that she's everything you ever dreamed of bro. 🙂
dude i was literally just binging his vids while i was eating and i saw this one just came out lmfao
How do you talk to girls??
Sometimes you forget what the video is about when your watching swoozie
I love your videos so much 🤩🤩
Look at Rachel giving tax advice! 😂😂😂😂
Sadly I relate to waaayyy too many of these examples. My last relationship would be a GREAT swoozie story. The things that happened to me.....
If only this video was around before my ex, could've saved me so much heartache and headache. Much love for the awesome advice swooz
LOVE THE VIDEO
Bro this story is nuts
Bro not gonna lie to you I've definitely gotten a black eye from a door cuz I ran into it but yeah
# SAVEABBY
lol.
“ know your value.. and add tax” I LOVE THAT AHAHAHA
I just did a reading comprehension on this
Mighty convenient this just dropped I just got out out of a toxic argument
.....
here so early that the music hasn't rendered into the video yet
I ain’t never clicked on a video so quick in MY LIFE.. lo siento not lo siento✌️
Who just makes out? You capping Swooze. 😂
I loved "know your worth then add tax".
Yes another video
Oh. She CRAZY crazy.
“11 months ago” Yeah only a few months ago lol.
Swoozie looking like Ne-Yo
W video
You can get a black eye from a door but that’s still messed what he did…
Declines two months of free rent!? Pfffft
Bandit is ur accountant for girls, what a g
Damn who else wants to be friends with swoozie
Afro Ninja approved advice 🥷🏾🤙🏾
Rip me  then am in that position right now
You just wanted to show us that bottle but okay
It can because I got one from a metal bar
*Notastalker247* is typing...
A Door Handle can give you a black eye though!
love the bottle analogy i definitely gotta take the lid off
I think swoozie tryna tell us abt his real life toxic friends cuz now thrs been a string of videos abt toxic relationships and Ls.. we here for u bro
So I hate that my husband is a slob.  I tell him all the time, and nothing ever happens.  To me, as long as the mess stays in his office only, I don't care.  I've definitely considered leaving, I've actually packed my things up once or twice, but the convenience of having someone to share expenses with is more important than a mess.  Plus divorce is expensive and I seriously can't afford to live on my own, and trying to find a roommate doesn't sound appealing to me, especially not a stranger.  It's not like I'm unhappy, but like there's zero reason to be that fucking lazy.
yes a door can give you a black eye it happened to me when i was a kid
You keep meeting the same type of females..smh
Swoozie man i learn a lot about relationships from your vids man 👍🏼👍🏼 im excited to have a real relationship now that im outta junior college.
Sniperwolf ??? 👀
Number 1 toxic relationship sign: Boyfriend/Girlfriend turns green.
I’ve never had a toxic girlfriend, BECAUSE I’VE BEEN SINGLE MY WHOLE LIFE! HA HA HA HA! 😁 I’m so lonely...😭
Appreciate the fresh outfits and 💎💎 you be droppin
Dude really released this while all of the botw 2 and E3 hype is going on. Rip the views that are getting sapped
Know your value.. and add tax ! Ily <3
It’s a good day when swoozie uploads
Woooow feeling really called out here Swooz… but you’re right 😅 I told my ex “I’m not your plan B, you either choose me or you loose me” which is from your videos (from ages ago) but it’s actually really helped me get away from that toxic relationship… so thank you ♥️
“Is her left thumb bigger than her right thumb” 😂😂
Swoozie how long did you make out?...
“Know your value and add tax” PERIDOT 👏 Another fantastic video, Swooz!
It is possible to get a black eye without getting hit in the eye socket. Trauma to the nose, brow bone, or forehead can cause black eyes because gravity pulls the blood down below the eyes. You can see this occurrence often when people get rhinoplasty. That being said… what he did was still physical (and probably psychological) abuse. Chasing someone down and kicking in a door to get to them is an act of violence. Not to mention, what was his goal when he caught up to her?
swoozie when he figures out she's single Somethings wrong i can feel it
I'd probably been the one in the toxic relationship, i just can't handle people usually, rather be alone then letting people into ones life and destroy them or ruin that specific person.
Does the hero Gotham needs respond tho
“What happens is you start avoiding your friends and family so you don’t have to explain your boyfriends toxicity when you see ‘em.”  That was exactly me.
Star wars mini skirt and you ain't proposed on the spot?
whispers, "........WOOOOOW........"
Swoozie has taught me about relationships than my parents would  ever will
Swoozie love your work bro no homo👏👍❤💙❤
Swoozie: This girl’s an Adult she can make her own decisions Me: well it’s obvious she can’t make her own decisions cause she was told what to do😂
I needed a new video from you today. Been oddly bummed out for no reason. Thx swooz
guys hot girl summer is my cousin....
i just love how good of a friend swoozie is ...
At 4:48 swoozie said "ok gotta go by" and a fast and furious ad plays
Did you always have a eye brow slit? am I trippin?💀
She REALLLLLLLY IS TRYING MONKEY BRANCH TO YOU, But you are deflecting like a Jedi. You didnt take the bait 👏👏🤝🤝 Good job,. so she  Extremely, Super Hot, but single? Red flag, Sus AF. High chance she is toxic. Lol ends up marrying him TF? 😂😂😂😂 TOXIC CONFIRMED. Swoozie I know it doesn't feel like it or rather wont but i really believe you dodged a bullet. I could be wrong but I doubt it.
Got a black eye from a door in second grade
we all know the earth is shaped like a doughnut with anime girl proportions
Her over clinginess screwed up her chance with you. Then a horrible relationship. That's really sad.
You can just "okay, bye!" To a crazy girl. She crazy.
Am batman 😐
It sounds to me like you're getting one side of the story. I understand he had his flaws but people are usually never going to tell you what they did. People don't stay in relationships when it's all bad. Clearly there's some good or they're both doing bad.
FWB is dumb. you asking for an STD and internalized trust issues and self hate.
Gotta remember swooz, they only tell you the bad things. There could have been 20 good days to every bad 1. Not saying it wasn’t toxic, but remember you only hearing the bad and there had to be a reason she was staying other than pure stupidity
Quick someone get hit by a door for research purposes
I just got out of one yesterday and she had all these signs. Thank you
Based
Cool hat freddy krueger
So smart
Swoozie saying wow is now my fav meme
Bro swoozy you are on your own bro I’m as shocked as you are bro
Thanks for the advice Swoozie, I've aways watched your videos (Since the BEGINNING BRUH) but lately I've felt pretty down in the dumps since I left a relationship that I tried so hard to make work. Honestly, you have the timing of a God. Thank you again, and you really made me feel better for the decision chosen!
lmao the mystery link
They were both toxic, one overly dependent the other controlling. Toxic relationships, like any relationship take two.
I have toxic ex-best friend who just so happens to be my next door neighbor. Send help.
The door black eye is fasho possible, have seen many dudes get a black eye or even 2 from a direct nose hit. Your videos are hilarious btw
"Know your value... And add tax."  This is such a crazy good line. More people need to listen to it.
To be honest in my opinion, without offending anyone or being condescending, and without triggering anyone, i just wanna say i got nothing to say
Just got out from a relationship last week because my girl cheated, thank you for the content Swoozie 🙏
Ma’lady
Swoozie with the drip 👌😂
This video is #1 trending in my eyes
Swoozie says a few months ago when in reality it was almost a year ago XD
Man. I thought you Finally found The ONE SWOOZIE. Maybe Next time 🤷🏾‍♀️
Toxic people will not only destroy and control their relationship, they will also try and control everyone around them. Friends sis inlaw narcissist psychopaths  plays damsel in distress crocodile tears whenever she can’t  her way and manipulates everyone on her side even though she’s wrong! Karen of all Karen’s!
nah but fr i wanna know if a door can give you a black eye .🧍🏾‍♂️
Swoooooooooovie 🤗🤗🤗🤗
It's weird cause that actually happened to me before. I was running down the Hall and just ran into my Room door
He knew we were bouta check Anne on his insta...
Wazzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzuuppppp
Less gooo
sWooZie: Wears a Fedora  Perry the platypus: Finally A Worthy Opponent Our Battle Will Be Legendary
Damn man. I wish this video existed last November. This is exactly what happened to me
I love the Counter :o
Yes video
great video
Know your value, then add tax.👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾That's a word!!
unless it was the door handle a basic rectangle door can hit you in the eye but it's a light grazing, even if the door is going fast and was pushed hard it still would just graze the socket albeit faster. he punched her for sure.
"relationships"  damn can't relate
Uh oh
Yes a door can give you a black eye it has happened to me 🤣
Ha
these fits get more off the wall and fire every vid 🔥
Swoozie
Thank you so much for your story-time/lesson I need to hear it,The bottle symbolic thing was very useful information i needed:D
A long swoozie video?! Awesome
Dang u givin away her Club Penguin 6:19
Finally an uploaf😭
Swooz kinda dropped the ball on this one.
I am thinking maybe she fell and the door knob hit her Idk
This isnt just for toxic relationships. This goes for friendships too.
Honestly I knew shit was gonna hit the fan when she turned down 2 month rent free far from her problem
man, are you an animal constantly pursuing after whoever you think is hot. Sounds like you don’t care about how a lady’s like as long as she’s hot.
This was it right here!!!
A door can mess your eye up bad. Ask me how I know... I needed 6 stitches. You gotta think about it. It aint the flat side of the door swinging out to you, it's the edge/corner of the door.
a door can give you a black eye       a door with fist.
Slightly early gang
Sign #1: U get poisoned when U come within 10ft of them.
You can get a black eye if u turn away from the corner of the door and ur close enough to it.
I like the outfits swoozie be wearing on his videos and it makes me interested of what he is gonna wear next on his video.
If the corner of that door hits u in the face kinda inline with your eye it will definitely give u a black eye
He has posted again! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
wait why would she say no to that?!?!? sounds like there’s two sides to this story. why would she continue to date him.
Damn I hate these perfect ad placements
I haven't been in too many relationships but 100% the biggest killer is both people being at different stages or having different ideas of where it's at. YET ANOTHER GREAT VID SWOOZIE this guy actually has such good advice
Sometimes the girl HAS to give the guy the option to chose between family and her because of how toxic the family would be and how up to his mama's ass the man would be,  Its either better mental health or nothing
SWOOZIE I MISSED YOU MY DUDE I ALWAYS LOVE YOUR VIDS
my guy you should of let her stay with you for a month why you'll never know that she might be the one for you so yeah
I’ve gotten a black eye from a door before… the corner of the door lined up with my eye.
wait so...did she ever get out?
He missed an opportunity in my opinion
sometime if you have a big heart..you end up in situations like that. You tell yourself if you love them enough they will change and be okay. You care too much to hurt them..you end up trapped by your own love and compassion. I ended up like that a lot before ending up with my husband. I had partners hit me and strangle me..leave me when things got to serious and yet I kept forgiving and loving them....the side effect of the caring heart is the desire to fix and save everyone...which gets you into situations like this.
a door could give a black but that’s nothing i would ever do to my wife they should have broke up when that happened
i remember XANGA
This reminds me of that boondocks episode with ebony brown
"i've been in a toxic relation ship once or thrise" Lmao
You can get a black eye form blunt trauma to the nose....though she probably would've mentioned that, if that were the case.
this is why YouTube
13:34 that was literally me when i heard that
It's been quite a while
yo swoozie
*Swoozie the love doctor is in the house*
what's a simp human being ?!🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🧐🧐🧐🐨✌🏼
i like when the other person comes on strong because that’s how i am
Lol funny
I feel for u man.
WOW...just WOW!!!(my mind is open)
You spoiled us again!? 14 minute videos... U cereal?
A door could give u a black eye
Swoozie sir you are a cheat code for relationship.I am single and I'm taking in  your knowledge
I relate to that gaming pfp though process ssooooooo much
Was it sniperwolf or however her name is spell lol
Wonder who this chick is
Hey
This guy could talk about anything and still get millions of views I would even watch if it was just about cheese
It's true tho, you can't find anyone better than me.
Hey sWooZie, I actually just got out of a toxic relationship recently, thank you for making this video!
"Know your value and add tax' best quote I've heard in a long damn time
Wait a minute, isnt there another story exactly like this?
I needed this video ty
You lied there no such thing as a girl that looks better in person then on their Instagram pic
“Know your value and add tax”. As person with low self esteem, this hits for me. Damn 😐
You cannot help those who do not want help themselves. When she declined you helping her get out and not stay at your place, you have to wonder what the real motives were at at point. I'm not victim blaming by any means. You opened a door for a way out and she pulled a "I'm going to pretend I didn't see that" because she wouldn't have had a man near her. She sounds like someone who doesn't feel complete without someone at her side, good or bad.
Yup a door can’t give you a black eye
maaaaan fuck that she might be a good person but she stupid at least from the way u said it
you made it seem like she was the toxic one before you mentioned the boyfriend
Ive gotten a black eye from a door before i can confirm
💯 14:07 - 14:38 are super important points, especially 14:15 - 14:19 💯
Hey senior medical student here, a hit to the scalp can cause a black eye because blood can accumulate from your highly vascular scalp to around your eye, making it look like you got punched in the eye, when it's really because of trauma to the scalp. I remember seeing it in my ENT rotations when a woman ran into her very clean glass door which caused her to break her nose and get a black eye.
Girl: Me and my bf had a fight and I'm staying with him Swoozie: Wow 😮 Girl: So I'm breaking up with him Swoozie: Really 😮 Girl: Were getting back together  Swoozie: Wow 😮 Girl: Were married now  Swoozie: 🙃💀
Swoozie posting twice in a month ?
Portion control 👌
10:42 as someone who plays Chess live everyday and makes videos about it on my YouTube channel this made me smile :)
what if they were crawling away, locks the door but door busted open and Bam ....Doorknob!!!
Its a good day when swoozie post
"And add tax""
I would say no to her like she sounds like someone who just makes impulsive decisions and a believer of self sabotage. My ex husband was the exact same way and I gave him multiple chances to stop with the toxic behavior but some people do not change...so ppl need to move on. It’s sad though but it is what it is....there is billions of other ppl to try to be with lol. That was nice of Swoozie to offer to pay for her rent for 1 month but the fact she declined that just shows her self sabotaging behavior smh.
AMONG US!!!
Lmao oh god someone actually knows Xanga?! When I bring it up no one knows about it xD
Amen
SWOOZIE!! 😃💕
6:19 I lost it at Club Penguin! 😂
I love this advice so much
as a person who has accidentally kicked a door into someone’s eye before, yes. they can give you a black eye. Your eye has to be really close to the door tho
It is possible to get hit by a door but not still think this girl be tripping
Nice hat! Greetings from Germany
Pro tip: women don’t like to be called “females”
Know your value AND ADD TAX 🙌👏 Thanks Swoozie 😭😭
Study for exams❌ Watch Swoozie✅
It's most likely that the guy hit Anne sorry if I got her name wrong
i feel like the only way you can get a black eye from a door would be from the knob
That bottle analogy was amazing lol!
Yes,a door can't give black eye 😂😂 very sus
One of my best friends is in a toxic relationship and I think this is a video he should watch thank you swooz
The YouTube gods have bestowed upon us a new sWooZie video! Today is a good day 🤩

I've walked in to a door side so maybe If it was the corner. For sure a black eye.
“Know your value then add tax” (+GST/VAT/PST/ETC!)
yes a door can give you a black eye i ran in to a door win i was 3 and it gave me a black eye so yes
We waited 3 weeks for a 14 minute video 😭😭
this a good video to send to her ngl
A door would give you a whole purple side of the face not just a black eye...
"know your value..... and add tax" 💯🔥
You were willing to do way too much for a girl you only went on one date with…
Swoozie i'm going to need you to link your bed/headboard. it is so pretty!
I love the new animators in the vids but I kinda wish it was swoozie doing the drawings like before! Still love the videos tho ♥️😍
Yo finally
If anyone has tried to fix a relationship friend or dating and the other person doesn't think they did anything wrong, it is impossible to fix
I really hope you find someone as wonderful as yourself
the king has returned
Club penguin 😂😂😭😭
Bandit a real one for being the reliable one and animating for you lol
Whoever disliked this video is toxic and hates on fedoras.
I'm scared of b.o.b. myself in this day and age...
Love your vids swooz😭😭
She should have called the police
The way I screamed finding this new upload pure happinesses 😱 💜
I was once fixing a closet door that folds open that had fallen and it fell on my face just at the right angle that it gave me a black eye for a few days. So I can attest to doors giving black eyes.
Have a problem with portion control when it comes to love
Your the best Swoozie!
Anns an ediot
7,5k likes in 30 minutes, WOWW
Been there 😂
There has to be like a 1000 alternate futures where Swoozie married the girls he talks about
i know the video over but i’m still looking at my door like how she get that black eye
We are back yessir
.....bruh...😒 She belong to the streets
"Know your value and add tax" imma start saying that
Your stories are amazing! I hope for more awesome stories ❤ p.s is your booboo okay lol
I had a huge crush on a girl, and she liked me back, but when we started dating she became super clingy. HUGE turn-off, as a fellow clingy female.
Swoozie I like and enjoy your video but I don’t see the reason why are you complaining you had the chance to end the toxic relationship but you deny her request to stay at your house for a month bro when you could of put an end to something you do not like I don’t see the reason to complain after
i love getting relationship advice when im not even allowed to date
Bro I'm not a women but I feel bad for y'all men can just be terrible sometimes 😕
they both sound toxic. bye bye.
You can get a black eye pretty easily, unfortunately. Door, fist, telephone phone.  Not to mention in the particular scenario she explained, her face was likely close to the door frame trying to close it.
14:07, this.
Amen ♾
Definetly worth the wait
“Know your value and add tax” duderanime 11:11
From life experiences, NEVER assume that your friend isn't also toxic
The side of a door gave me a black eye and almost broke my socket :(
Imagine you were Swoozie's lawyer and you saw him do this while recording a youtube video 2:00
I needed to hear this
“Know your value and add tax” Gold ✨
10:07 "I'll be out of your hair in 30 days" yeah like thats ever gonna happen. No way its gonna take 30 days to get outta this guy's hair.
Bro this guy teaches me more about life then my parents lol
Wowwww
“relationships should on to your happiness but be the reason for your happiness “. and that’s on periodt💅🏾
Someone leaking the Instagram name?
You laid it down to good that's why she was so clingy for every 100 roller coasters you ride you'll only remember the best one
SWOOZIE MAKE LONGER VIDEOS
Hiiiiiii Swoozie!!
Me majority of the video: DAMN😓😓😓😓😓  Me at 13:32: OHHHH HELL NAH!!!!!
7:30 I learned this the hard way
👋🏼
I don’t know a single person who dislikes swoozie
I think that a door could give you a black eye if you were looking down and turned to the side a little but if your looking straight at the door it would just hit your brow and cheekbone and maybe your nose
Toxic relationships are the worst because the toxic person never realizes they’re toxic 😒
Each swoozie video is another rented hotel room.
Every day we have plenty of opportunities to get angry, stressed or offended. But what you're doing when you indulge these negative emotions is giving something outside yourself power over your happiness. You can choose to not let little things upset you. 🌠💪
Yo! EdE Monster is how I found sWooZie! Great Twitch community, check him out folks.
AMC 🚀🚀🚀
A few months (11) months
Hitting her with the door is a problem but, having your S/O cut contact with a man who you know she has a thing for really is not toxic. She should not be talking to you if she has a man in the first place. You have to put yourself in the man's shoes, if your S/O was talking to someone you knew they had a thing for its a sign of disloyalty, they either stop talking to them or get out.
I've had a sibling give me a black eye that way when we were messing around being idiots lol kicked the door open right into my face and i ended up with a black eye and bruised cheek bone lol
Also I love the ending. Know your value and add tax.
I would do it bro you missin out on a chance
Another banger from our boy swoozie
Everytime swoozie drops a video it automatically gets a like
Early for the video!
Well from experience my friend accidentally opened a door and it slams to my face mostly my eye and it hurt a lot I thought I got a black eye so when I got home and looked in the mirror there was nothing
We are here and supporting EVERYBODY 🤍
I was here in the first 32 min
Me who isn't even in a relationship but has a toxic life: **watches with anticipation**
I hate how every time I'm early I don't have any creative comments
That last line made me cry. Thank you Swoozie
Swoozie’s videos are so amazing 🤩 I’m living for them 💪
I would’ve Let her stay cuz 1 night=kiss imagine what 30 nights=😂
I know this story too well 😔
Yo Swooz... ur "first time" storytime?  Clicbayt and good content in one...
12:05 my exact reaction
His work (and you cant tell me different) is a ✨master piece✨
I love it keep it coming ❤️
Wasssuuuuppp swoozie big fan
swoozie = goat goat = greatest of all time
a door can definitely give u a black eye. I've actually been in that exact situation. not abuse it was an accident. I walked away he came after me I slammed the door, he opened it and it hit me in the face. complete accident. but possible
swoozie just some quick love bro love u and all ur vids,3
Swoozie you dropped the ball on this one so hard
Yeah this poor girl was lying, something domestic abuse victims do often.
In this problem a lot 😓
"i wish a girl would tell me to pick my family or her" ✊🏼🙏🏻
I don't get toxic relationships, all I get is mixed signals
If the door gave her any kind of bruise it would be a thick line bruise from cheek to above the brow. Full eye bruise is straight fist to eye. I was in a few toxic relationships and I know all the kinds of bruises one can have. Also a toxic relationship does not stop at marriage. It gets worse because now they think they have full control over you. They see you as property and nothing more than a doll to keep on their shelf and they only bring you out to fight or play mind games with. A narcissistic person will never know that they are narcissistic because they think they're always right and everyone is stupid. They start to turn your friends and your family against you and make you feel like you're the problem.
Im tryna figure out who’s a really cute pro girl gamer that got married but i have no idea😭
Doing the math this was all over the span of 9 years?
As someone who's been in a relationship that was so incredibly toxic it's even a little absurd, it's never a bad idea to just, let a toxic relationship go. I know that it might be hard, but it will ultimately make you feel better in the long run. It is always okay to do something for yourself, especially if someone else is hurting you.
I was the friend in a toxic relationship. It took  tons of effort to leave that relationship. Thankfully I had a wonderful support group who helped me after I got out. And now I'm married to a wonderful guy.
Life lesson you see swoozie you watch it
*Swoozie has really become our relationship therapist*
well said
W
ayo my birthday in sept 15
You when is swoozie gonna pop a video out of his wedding cause this man needs to get married. Get married swooz
Love your love advice
The king spitting facts!
thank u swoozie :)
The portion control yes less is more  if you pour too much that’s the only leaving bye
I messed the background music, but good story.
Here before 50k views!
It can I got a black eye form a door it just matter on we’re you are on the other side of the door
The drip 💧
I find the fact that she declined your offer to live anywhere except with YOU kinda sus....
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
love the videos
Lmao 🤣😆🤣💯 Toxic relationships
Swoozies throwing videos to us like rocks
banana
how can she decline such an option 😒🙄
Girlfriend: it's me or your family  Me: 🖕 bye
Honestly, they both sound toxic and probably need therapy. Sheesh
Not me being early to a SWOOZIE video
It’s cool that you made this video but I’m questioning the ethics of putting her issues out there like that. I know the public won’t know who she is but she will and her friends will know.
People call everything toxic nowadays
“Oh you didn’t hear? They got married” “Bruh”
People will only do to you what you allow them to.
Pain. Just- painting but remove the ring. Wise words tho man
So you want me to add the tax for my town or yours?
4:12 wow
But it's understandable that he doesn't want her to be friends with someone who she made out with and clearly still has a thing for you. Ps I'm not justifying his cheating I'm just saying to put yourself in the guy's shoes. Having your girl talk to someone she made out with. Maybe not tell her to block you but tell her how he feels so she can kind of create a healthy distance.  Anywho, good to see you back to posting unless if I have been living under a rock and didn't see previous posts. With all support all the way from Sweden xoxo
11:43 and beyond, "Wooooow". lmao. This is hella funny, she said your name and now she has to remove you from her existence, FOREVER. Great way to ensure she will come back to her cheating boyfriend again lol.
and add tax!
Swoozie just can't get a real one smh. Been following this man for 10 years
Swoozie dropping 2 in a month Yesirrr
He’s back
Swoozie you can get a black eye from a door (Idk if someone told him already)
Know your value and add taxes.
Ok I love the “know your value. And add tax” cause damn that’s the truth  And toxic goggles are a thing I have worn those damned rose colored glasses before and I didn’t take them off til he ghosted me the first time.  Peeps in toxic relationships can’t see shit even if it was a purple unicorn riding on a hippo that was balancing on a unicycle.  They may say that that is normal or they don’t see it at all🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Hold on tipsy Mario kart? I’m writing that down
So when the meeting to find this girl name “Ann” I need to know the date and time weather and temperature
Sad u had 2 openings the konth of talking tve move in breakup u should have sot ur shot
Probably one of the edges hit her in the eye  swooz
swoozie uploading during nintendo direct :pensive:
first i have never been in a relationship (Girlfriend/boyfriend) type so hearing these stories help me choose and be a better person before i start one.
Just had a situationship where a guy was sexist towards me and stood me up 4 times and I kept telling myself I don’t want to hurt him and what if I can’t do better than him. I stopped seeing him after the fourth time he stood me up and now he’s kinda stalking me. If you hear Brittany Spears in the background of your head…do yourself a favor and leave.
"Star wars one piece miniskirt" all down hill from her . . .
That’s toxic toxic, I can so relate... I feel for her she must have some deep rooted trauma that doesn’t allow her to break free from the cycle.. I hope she finds herself
I don't think you have missed in a decade sir
What’re good ways to tell if a parent is toxic?
Me: *is single* Brain: Just in case bro
Swoozie know Eddie Monster? The twitch streamer? That’s brazy but when we gonna see you in tournaments again my guy sheeesh lmao 😂
I don't want to sound like a clingy, impatient person but I do think it's crazy that you talked to her for 4 years before meeting her in real life. Not even FaceTime? 4 years wtf.
The hat tho sheesh
Who wants to join a group to find all the girls that Swoozie talks about? 😆
This is why I'm single
Swoozie ima need you to rewatch that spongebob episode with squidward becoming beautiful when a door hits him, I think he has a black eye at one point
"girls this cute don't talk to me"  LMAO HE THROWING HELLA SHADE RN
That last part just helped me thanks man
Ngl really needed to hear this today. Good looks Swoozie.
Wow thats crazy 😳  At least u trying to help others avoid or better the situation   BTW follow me on ig wrathbydre 🔥🔥🔥
Preach
U go bro playing chess she was gonna milk u
Cool but botw 2 just got a new trailer. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
swoozie u gotta smash to get it
Swoozie that fedora finna make me act up *ISWEARTOGOD*
My reaction *Silent Wow*
I love your video and big fan .
Ah yes another amazing video
i gave my roommate a black eye with a door... I kicked it open and it hit his face
This video is why nice guys finish last and girls go for the bad guys
wow
ahhh new bideo.............
What happened to the story when meeting you were suppose to meet your big ex after she left a thousand of angry message because she thought you left her hanging.
that bottle analogy was smart ash
Sorry I’m late, I was doing something important.
Hello there
TWO WHOLE MONTHS FOR FREE?!?!  & she said no I- 🧍🏽‍♀️
Had a friend like that. International couple. After a while, I gave up and never cared again.
WoooooW
I voted for the other thumbnail
Ik this vid was gonna come lol
Solution to avoid toxic relationship: be single
Dude the bottle metaphor was god tier advice 🙏🏼 can everyone take a moment to appreciate this man 7:29
i saw "posted 27 minutes ago" and just nut
A door can give you black eye if your hit by it near your eye and with not enough force
You tell stories in such a good way lol. Along with life advice for ppl.
lol watching this, was relatable AF ! LOL even though never had the line you'll never find anyone better than me. But the threatening their lives was a common one. The avoiding family and friends was on point >< until after it ended, told them everythingggggg. lol
Its always a good day when swoozie posts
And add tax..... what we talkin like 60%
as a man ive def gotten a black eye from being hit with my door
Oh my gawwwddd lol she married the dude da fuqqqqq.
That fedora is intoxicating…🤤🤤
Early gang!
Someone try and find this girl
nah i dont think a door can give you a black eye
I've never been in a relationship but I've been advising and third wheeling my friends and this one guy manipulate my friend like me the girl and the guy are friends but we're more close than the girl and I tell ya that guy tried to whoo me like you guys in a relationship wth are you taking advantage of my hobbies like this dude tryna be good I was soooo mad when this guy confessed to me on Christmas eve and bruh he tryna dumped my girl my friend?!?! Just what???? Like seriously this guy tryna break my friendship with her luckily after weeks and weeks of telling my fam to break up with him because he's a toxic manipulative guy and turns out this isn't the first time he cheated like when he try to whooo me he be sliding to this another friend of mine like seriously dude??? And finally after mah fam realizes than he's not worth it she dumped him and now trying to win her again like dude you seriously be acting like that now and acting victim when you almost destroyed our friendship and pressure her??? Like heck man. (sorry if the story is messy my English is not that great level yet😂😂😂😂)
do a flip
Watching this video will undoubtedly make me relive my past and just make me angry. So I'mma leave a like and bounce. FELLAS, remember, she's not worth it. Don't be miserable out of fear of being lonely. How long will it take for it to become physically violent? You don't want to know.
door cant give you a black eye, this is dumb. You can only get something like scratch about your eye, but not a circled bruise
yankee doodle over here.
They are both toxic man she is just lying to you even tried guilting to stay over your place and when it failed they went back to Plan A
POV: you saw the notification
This is one of my favorite YouTubers because he is so funny 😂
This is why I choose to stay single
BRUH
The worst injury I've seen from a door to the face is a small scar in the forehead. I don't know tho for ann
Omg a video about the story of my life 💀💀
She was animated that's why she got a black or maybe make up 😂
No colors!? I sleep
dang this breakfast just became bomb af 💣
U crazy after the month of talking u aint shot ur shot
early gang?
hey swoozie I’m an og so when will you rent out vista-wayyy
I feel you I have friends who will be the toxic person in the relationship and then I have friends who will have a toxic partner and I always try to warn them hey you're being toxic or hey this person seems toxic and most of the time they don't listen and then it ends up bad like I said it would. I'd say for the most part I'm a lot wiser then most of my peers and some people would be like oh that's a good thing but in reality it kinda drives me insane. The thing that drives me insane the most is when people come to you for relationship advice and then you give them some and then they don't listen and then there relationship crumbles and you wanna say I told you so but you also have to comfort them cus there down bad and then they do the same thing over again.
I personally have gotten hit by a door in the eye but I didn’t get a black eye so idk 🤷
Your friend is the man in the chair, digging up stuff about the person you are talking to to see if they are crazy
How Are You Doing Swoozzz  What you thinking About How Are you feeling man people should ask more and deeper questions yo
Help her file a police report.   As her friend, that's checkmate.
$5000000000000000000000000+tax =you
This is too ironic I literally just got out of a toxic relationship where she wanted me to delete someone because she was jealous. I confronted the issue and she hasn’t said a word. It hurts but like swoozie said we are worth more than being hurt, we kings and queens up in this piece. 🤙🏻 thank you for the video my guy I so needed to see this
Loving the upload schedule 😼🤲
Hi
that portion control advice is just what i needed to hear right now.
What camera does this man be using I need it
swooozie bro i needed this vid like 3 years ago man
Clingy women is wild nobody is ready for that especially poc dating dont know that qik
Hiii swoozie!!@
swoozie in his element
imma buy a tv that only shows SwooZie.
What if both are toxic? Ones a desperate and other is a passive douche bag
If I had to do a report on someone who lived an interesting life I would choose sWooZie :)
Well crap...           My toxic friend count is unhealthily high
new vid new storyline
I don’t get into relationships because I never really signs of toxicity, I’m not good at reading people tbh
Dont
Think she was capping. Just for you to feel sorry for her and want her or make you jealous.
8:47 maybe she was just trying to protect him a lot of girls do that bc they think their bf will change
The man is back
Every time Swoozie makes a video, I feel like I should take notes 📝 🧐
I'm  going  threw something  like that.  Sometimes I think  I'm the toxic one. Like today she got mad over how I didn't  like  how she responded  to me getting  her the same type of gift  but not of the right kind/ brand. She said ( and I quote) " if it's not this one or just like it I'm not gonna use it." So i say OK fine  I'll just return  it cus it's not that kind or whatever  and she's  mad.  So now we're  going  to help  her mother  get back from a big flight  and all she's blasting on the radio is Billy Irish  and that one song by mgk ( "punch him  in the face,  you didn't like what he said right...").  Don't wanna be toxic but idk  if I am or not
This is one of the most confusing things ive ever listened to.
Annie are you ok?
New swoozie video?! Turns out my day WILL be good!
FEDORA?!!?!?
F
He didn’t color in Ann he knows we are ninjas when it comes to this
13:32 thass tufff
Is it funny I was listening to toxic before this
The fact the this manz put on a WHOLE outfit just to talk, is dedication. And I love it.
Sure, BOB may be a 60-year-old man but he may have the best personality out there...
Yessir first 17 minutes we out here
Yo should have added ASKHOLE on the title if anyone remembered that video.
yo swoozie i love the vids and this vid hits hard because i have had a couple toxic relationships before keep up the amazing work
So I got hit in the face  by one of those big ass school door at full force only because I was trapping my friend inside but I got hit and the worst is that I had to get two stitches in my eyebrow and when there was blood like everywhere but I see where your coming from tho  Swoozie that do be soundin pretty Suspicious
Nothing makes happier than seeing a 10 minute plus swoozie video
Damn no gamer gorlfwerind😔
Know your value, and add tax.
Ngl I thought the girl in this video was going to be the toxic one because of how perfect she was 😅
a whole 4 years without seeing her .WOWWWWWWW
You think swoozie would play DOA with me?
can a door give you a black eye?
So I was once friends with this toxic relationship and they were fighting like once every 2 weeks, and I was the person that the boy went to, but the problem with this is that I was a toxic person who always knew what was going on, I’m not friends with them anymore, they ghosted me, and I then learned that great power comes great responsibility, and now, I always know what’s going on with everybody, and I haven’t been wrong for almost a year now. Just remember to be smart when your dating people, they are still together I think and that’s always good
"Oh you didn't hear?"  "They just got married"  *Aggressively throws my phone*
Know your value...then add tax.  Couldn't have said it better.
U got paper 4yrs y u not go there
I am your lost son Dad please come get me I’m ready to practice playing video games😩
damn Swoozie being the Yoda of life advice.
My reaction to her choices: "Huh? Huh? Huh? HUH? HUH?!?!?!?!?!?"
Me: sad that there is probably no new dragon ball games  Swoozie: “Im abt to end this mans whole career”
I've been in toxic relationships for years until I met the guy that I'm with now. He's great and he does have his flaws, but he treats me good
Why was this not at all about any situation I'm in right now but it had so much information that I needed to deal with the shit that I am in right now lmao 😂😭😭😭🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Toxic girlfriend: If we break up you'll never find someone like me  Me: Yea that the point, idiot
Swoozie she kinda put her self in that problem she had  plenty of times to get out of that problem I would have left at the part she got the black eye also love ur vids man ur like my childhood bro love u man
I need it… thanks
thank you for this, as someone that used to only have toxic relationships(i was drawn to violence/aggression because it reminded me of family) until now, this helps a lot to have the info spread of warning signs and whatnot
Love the video swoozie
Cute girls can unfortunately be single, because of toxic people
Guys like that are genuinely scary, and probably only rough with girls and would probably piss himself around guys.
Adande…I mean Rachel…”know your value and add tax!” Preach!
Who here thinks these videos from Swoozie is actually just his way to talk to 1 girl he hurt or feel bad about.  We just all here from the ride.
Could be a trans
Hey Swoozie great video,very inspirational. At the end you said to " Know your value and add tax." What is the "tax" in the metaphor?
Y'boy really out here with fat Freddy-Kreuger style fedora! Looking stylish my dude! ;)
"Know your value... and add tax"
Man this situation sounds awfully familiar 🤔
Why is swoozie such a pimp
Unfortunately, the only heart you can truly guard is your own. Doesn't make it easier to see it when people wanna be 'bolivious in their relationship - it does make for good storytelling tho! Thanks for all the videos, Swoozie!
im getting riped to night rip that       ay
swoozie i fucking love u and ur videos but please my man send to me ur videos and i will edit them for free just to remove the background noise, or if u use Premiere pro just use Denoise effect just drag it into the clip in the timeline, the 'bshhhhhhh' sound is so distracting 😅❤️
Sheeeeeeeeee il stop
NO WER NOT !!!
What’s up Swoos
Swoozie every time you upload me and my friend talk about your video for 7 hours!
i love how swoozie has a different animation style every video
swoozie gets friend zoned ode before he even gets right
*Sitting down to eat breakfast*  *Swoozie uploads new video  Me: all wait to eat
So the thumbnail on instagram.. now it's finally here!! 😌
Follow that Mystery Link in the Description!
wait i feel like the bottle analogy was so good
Know your value and add tax. Talking like a true king over here
I’ve been waiting to long
Swoozie is that your room or guest room
“Know your value, and add tax” I love that line
GANGGGGG
Can we appreciate the Cut quick
love the bottle analogy! it would be great if you could make a video about toxic traits that are common to have in yourself
“Know your value,and add tax” swoozie 2021
I see you Swoozie with the new camera angles. High. Production. Quality.
We here.
RRRRRR this is bulshit I feel bad for you Swoozie you're a good guy.
You know swoozie is special to me because I woke up from my nap for this video
Woooooow
Toxic no Brittany spears
I so feel for her, it sounds like he's a major manipulator. He probably told her that she's nothing without him and all of this stuff.
As a kid, I got hit in the eye by a door knob but...She probably wasn't kneeling so maybe the corner hit her?
sWoozie needs to hire a person to quote him
Swoozie saying "Wow" needs to be a gif. I need the internet to get to it. I'm deceased. 🤣
Thanks for posting on my birthday!
I feel so bad for her,she should get out of the relationship
Yo swoozie
i loveee uuu i wil be your simp foeever
Love vids man keep it up
Everyone: I can’t find a gamer girl that simps for me as much as I simp for them  Swoozie: yeah she simped to much…
early
I feel like sWooZie has been in a toxic relationship recently we got your back swoozie!
who is here before 10k likes?
I have no social interaction yall stay safe tho
Man is always giving the best advice 😌
You know it’s a toxic relationship when your partner is teabagging you.       This is a joke
Gamer community is not 90% dudes.
Have had my bröther slam a door in my face from the corner, black eyes can happen.
I really appreciate that you take the time with everything, its good to get the whole picture.
The 11 dislikes are the toxic ones in the relationship
Maybe the door knob hit her Swoozie... Like its a simple possibility😂😂😂
Lov the hat 😭
i knew you were trouble when you walked innnnnniiinnnnn og swoozie viewers will remember that
Yea boi
I did the "woooooows" at the same time
Swooz you can't say he toxic because she said she would go with a friend if they ever broke up that would make me feel some type of way too
Swoozie Lowkey a beta
people are stupid.
When we gonna get swoozie merch
It is possible to get a black eye from a door, when you get hit in the general area the entire thing can bruise and swell up, it's kinda like jamming your finger in the car door.
Get her another apartment.. welp u said that as I type it. Another option is let her stay with a female friend
Swoozie i got exams this week i cant have you uploading 14 minute videos like this
6:13 I’m exactly like dat w my bsf😭🏃🏽‍♀️
hellooo
I am here !!
This man said "We made out alot" Yeah okay
"You'll never find anyone better than me" is a huge problem in rap. A lot of rappers use that in breakup songs and it's extremely toxic. A lot of people will hear that and think it's ok.
what about the brothers/sisters? 🤔
Last time I was this early you were stealing Indiana jones magnets! 😝
Well, this video was handy !
A door can for sure give you a black eye but there'd be brusing around the eye too. It would be clear a large object hit you and not a fist. Hope you're both OK
Yo y’all tell me I wanna know the girl he’s talking about tell me her name if y’all find out
woah im really early
Swoozie out here giving life advice
early gang!
5 minutes in late not bad
Wooooooh i feel good 😂😂
“I will cook for you, I will-“ Me: Sounds good to me!
Sup
What's your xbox gt??
Going from Nintendo E3 to sWooZie makes this a great day 😄
Swoozie, please be more active, we miss your shit! Also insta like the video before watching
Here early
Notice how swoozie had a iphone mint colour and its purple huhh
Swoozie dude you live in an apartment no way brah I thought your in an mansion
yay
Maybe it was the door knob? It has happened to me before
He got into the story And I Completely forgot it was about Toxic relationships.
Probably a broken nose but black eye 🧢 cap
| Congrats! | You found my comment! | Here’s a cookie 🍪 |
Hi
I think his favorite word is now wow
He bak
"females"?? dude come on! just call us lady's, woman, girls, ect. don't say "females", I rather you just call me a slur....
"Woooowww"
Damn he looking fly as hell
It might be the door knob
The king is back
Swoozie he looking like a nice guy
swoozie being a mediocre simp is entertaining as hell
6:18 “here’s her Penguin” DON’T THIS TO ME SWOOZIE! IM GETTING SO MUCH NOSTALGIA! I MISS THAT GAME!
OOo i'm early as frigg hi swoozie how r u
"Your family or me" Bye, Felicia
Maybe the door had like a lock you know the ones that are like a chain insert type lock.
Very educational. Many thanks haha
Send this to Flightreacts
Correction!!! Doors can give black eyes if enough impact is projected, in fact any damage to your eye or eye area can induce a black eye
Why do Toxic people suck
YES A NEW VID
And yes a door can give a black eye. It happened to one of my friends
Love that we have a Nintendo direct and a swoozie vid in the same day 😁

I've  been waiting for a upload, bro I love you so much so does my mom 😂✋❤
You didn't cuff ???
This video is about the people who disliked it
A door can
Couldn’t have been the door bro
Yessss sWooZie out here bringing us amazing content yet again
I have friends who have broken noses, chipped teeth, and gotten stitches on their brow because of door related incidents.   Never a black eye.  That being said, a black eye can occur with a hard enough hit to the forehead.
Who ever dis likes this video is toxic and even knows it
If my people who are called by my name humble themselves, and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land.
overthinking comes in clutch.
sWooZie: she likes games Me: *Thats what I’m talking about sWooZie!!* sWooZie: we don’t play the same games Me: *the biggest disappointment in gaming history*
Yo
Dope hat swozzie
didn’t you already tell this story like 4 years ago?
Im still confused how swoozie is single.
when the relationship is sus get out
When you try to heal hurt with a relationship you make poor, emotionally driven decisions that you think will heal you.... just make it worse.  Get with God and let Him work on you before you get with another person and bleed all over them v
Fun videos
Always with the facts
"Toxins, we're not in Hell Morty, we're in the detoxicfier, the machine didn't blow up it worked normally, it removed our toxins, we're the toxins!"

Finally I've been waiting Swoozie Where Have You Been boi

Astrology bitches got hype for a minute there

How to not be in a toxic relationship:         Be alone forever…..problem solved 🙂

Uhh xbox
“Baby, can't you see I'm calling? A guy like you should wear a warning It's dangerous, I'm falling There's no escape, I can't wait I need a hit, baby, give me it You're dangerous, I'm loving it Too high, can't come down Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round Do you feel me now? With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride You're toxic, I'm slippin' under With a taste of a poison paradise I'm addicted to you Don't you know that you're toxic? And I love what you do Don't you know that you're toxic? It's getting late to give you up I took a sip from my devil's cup Slowly, it's taking over me Too high, can't come down It's in the air and it's all around Can you feel me now? With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride You're toxic, I'm slippin' under With a taste of a poison paradise I'm addicted to you Don't you know that you're toxic? And I love what you do Don't you know that you're toxic? Don't you know that you're toxic? Taste of your lips, I'm on a ride You're toxic, I'm slippin' under With a taste of a poison paradise I'm addicted to you Don't you know that you're toxic? With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride You're toxic, I'm slippin' under (toxic) With a taste of a poison paradise I'm addicted to you Don't you know that you're toxic? Intoxicate me now, with your lovin' now I think I'm ready now, I think I'm ready now Intoxicate me now, with your lovin' now I think I'm ready now” - Britney 2003
It's strange how you don't notice it until you are actually free from the Toxic relationship.  It took me a few years for me to rebuild myself mentally, but my fiancée has been incredible in making me the vastly improved and healthy man I am today.  Looking back, there were so many signs I missed from living through it.  Much love to ya sWooZie!
I can  finally smile today
Amazing animations
2:23 thank you for the confirmation because I was currently opening your followings on IG

Ann with no e? That's my name👀
0:12 “They lie a lot, have trust issues, they get overly upset over things, and you feel like walking on eggshells with them”  I know this is about romantic relationships, but he just perfectly described the relationship between Trisha Paytas and Ethan Klein on Frenemies
Swoozie really putting on a fit to tell us stories
Yo Swoozie going back to his old style
Yo Nintendo E3 direct and a Swoozie vid on the same day?! Man today has been full of surprises

Now that Swoozie confessed his embarrassing l's, let's see him now confess his amazing W's!!!
Yup 2 minutes late to the video. I’m very proud of myself.

Hi 👋🤗 love your content.   Last few life challenges has been watching loved ones die (cancer) but right now I'm emotionally struggling with a friend who is in a toxic relationship, it's so sad to see and hear, the excuses 🤯 I offered to move her, pack him up, law enforcement is involved, I wish she was ready to leave the relationship.
Love the vids swoozie
