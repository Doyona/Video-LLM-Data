thats pretty cool!
And now you know why there's a whole team of crew called 'Grips'.
I have more of theses great movies to watch but I have to comment on the loss of Levi, at this point in my viewing and I know I will be thinking about "How is Levi going to get around this" or marvelling at his anticipation of where a speeding mobile is going next, as it was the way you have handled all the livestock involved, that makes this such a great series if films to watch and I do hope you keep it up. Bye  Levi. I'll keep my eye out for you.  Dave I.
Welkom to my World....good job
How Cool!!!
That was def a porn set he was lighting up.
Was this for the VRBO commercial?
yo that light is lit 😁
I just saw the ad for casper, i was like hey thats Andrews work!
Cool episode watch it normal speed  to get all the contents ,,, Way different vibe compare to that Military's Truck
Did Andrew have to join IATSE before starting this job?
Ничего непонятно , но очень интересно .      Участок с домиком зачётный , хорошо видать после баньки на свежем воздухе в джакузях  повалятси.
2:35 you can see smoke coming from that light. Must be a hot beast to touch.
So, Andrew. When are you going to be buying one of those Arri Daylight lights for your videos? 😉😆⚡ I'm sure you've priced one of those generators that was on the back of that semitruck. 😂
What a handsome Aussie dog
adult film
Did you get a part in the porno  they were filming?
Use the bright light
👍👍👍
Andrew, I just looked it up and I can't find the TITAN I picked it up about ten years ago and now I can't find it look around to check out JL FISHER in Burbank ca anyway you can make this stuff  the camera dollies are cool they are all stainless and they crab too. COOL STUFF.
Look up L J. Fisher co, in North Hollywood California for the TITAN the last time we rented one we got it from them.
That's what is called a crystal sync generator cool I've done 34 feature films and 4 commercials you crawler is so cool. what do you charge for that? If you ever get a chance to see a TITAN it moves back and forth and it crabs too with a boom for cameras mostly but you can add a light to it too it's Andrew BIG so cool but heavy it will sink in the dirt, not like the crawler.
Does that make you a gaffer now?
Beautiful house!
We shot a show for discovery at my old job (tesla's death ray) it was an absolute delight working with such professional people.
You see how the light filters through at this angle? It make's for a spectacular shot...  Andrew: Yeah it was spectacular when I brought your mom here back in 2017...
O ATOR PRINCIPAL É ANDREW CAMARATA.
Andrew...did you meet any hot actresses on the set..LOL...  nice work with the light.
i mean, 5 more minutes of throwing the ball for that dog wouldnt hurt
Anyone notice that the light was smoking?
Dang I looked up 18k lights and that light is roughly $55,000. It's made by a German company called Arri which was founded in 1917. They appear to be like the Ferrari or the Snap-On of production equipment.
Guy explains to Andrew why they've spent thousands of bucks to make those shadows softer & "more pleasing on the eye" making the bedding they're trying to sell look nicer, video is then interrupted by an advert' & 100% of viewers click on 'SKIP AD' - think it tells you something about how messed up Capitalism is, no?!
Nice interview thrown in there.
I was noticing on one of you winter videos that you were having problems with equipment freezing to the ground?   You may have already figured it out but encase you haven’t, might I suggest taking kerosene, putting it in a garden sprayer and spraying down your moving parts on the equipment.  Tracks hydronic pins etc.  we’ve used that method for years and it works perfect.  Do this when you park and again just before you start using it again.  You should not have any freezing issues after this.  Good luck and I love the videos.  Great Job!
Now they need to do an Andrew Camarata ad
When the giant burning fireball of death in the sky just quite isn't enough.
Did they give you a room with a star?  I would have negotiated for a room with a star, yo!  Maybe even your own trailer with a star on the door!
Arri 18k frensnel hmi is about $22-23k for that light with a $1800-$2k bulb.  I use to own a pair of cinemills 18k silver bullets they were workhorses and heavy duty, aboit 160lbs heads,these arri are much lighter. My big cinemills 18k they require mole crankovator stands thats another $3k for the smaller stand and $5k for my larger stands.  Film gear is an expensive hobby
Andrew, Need to Change the Subject line to.  Working on a Film Set  for the 1st time.
Andrew= Jack of all trades
https://youtu.be/T-RUp82vqMg
sorry andrew, but i really dont understand why they brought you in for this. There already exists equipment in the film industry to do exactly what you're doing, Long john silver stands (weird name i know)
💪🏻"
You know that kids love your videos to im a 12 Year old and i love every single video make mr andrew
One more big vid and you're at a million subs! Can't wait!
Unrelated but thought you would find this very interesting https://youtu.be/x6MSt5B4KiU
Hi Andrew
When will there be a new medium youtube
👍👍👍
These guys could have hired anybody with a boom lift but they picked a guy with one million subs, Not by accident, Free advertisement.
Hope he goes out of business. All new yorkers deserve to starve
Pretty interesting 👍👊
Great experience. Producers….we need to get this light up in the air…locals we know a guy…
New to channel after a recommendation from Kelly's Country Life live stream
Cool👍
Amazing the lengths ad agency to, to convince vvombams they should buy their products.  "The things you own end up owning you." -Tyler Durden
Oh, a 'commercial', so that's the code word, right? It's good that you didn't film the 'action' as I consider your brilliant channel to be a family friendly channel 😜
I’ve been watching your channel for over a year now and just realized you are very close to me. If you need anything machine moves or stuck or anything hauled long distance or local just give us a call PRESTIGE TOWING 👍
Good job
Cody wasnt allowed to come to this job? lol
Working in the feature film Industry, not on that production, I still have to say thanks for supporting our industry.

i dont see whats happening
Notice how he told you after you finished with the light how much it cost. That was nice of him. I moved some kind of one off laser factory machine to San Diego that was worth millions but I didn't know it till I delivered it to the customer.
meanwhile Andrews content is more interesting and he does his own camera work/stunts
How you land this job?
Andrew going hollywood on us!
Right so Andrew is now thinking……..A new lighting rig for my own videos……..how hard can it be!!!!
Less than 30k til he gets his much deserved 1 mil sub button from YouTube, go Andrew
What brand or type of generator is that though? Was pausing the video to see if I can get a glimpse but I couldn't make out the "something power" on the side. That's great for a house backup power, whisper quiet.
That thing seems to have the flimsiest stand, I know it's probably sufficient for the weight of the lamp but it just looks so inadequate
Dogs 🐕 love ❤️ Andrew !
It’s kinda funny how Andrew probably has exponentially more watch time then every body there and he just makes videos of him dicking around
Andrew, what kind of drone are you using?
Não  falo inglês mas curto muito os seus vídeos admiro seu trabalho e inteligência e dedicação parabéns seguidor Brasil
3:06 another commercial being filmed in the distance with another simulated sunlight ? :p
I was impressed by how the show went on .. but the best part for me was Andrew playing ball with the dogs..
The worlds most over qualified gaffer. Lol
Basically, making a porno.  Lol, nah.
Handy boom rig!
Wow!  Interesting,How did you ever get that job?
I need that light against winter depression. Although... Then i’ll get a depression from my power bill probably 😂
There is no end to the different machines and jobs one can take on if you have a can do attitude like Andrew!
What's wrong with the sun?
Hey Andrew, here are some attachments you don't have yet. The quicker picker and riper are both cool.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCTdQMZx8sg
Here, Andrew run this bucket truck? Like, wtf is going on here?
Oh nice! Production.. my world, although I don't do movie/tv I'm in the events production world. Nice Andrew! Credited?
adult flick prep?
How old are you buddy ... because you seem pretty young to k ow as much as you do... LOL...you are pretty resourful..great job on your projects
I bet they call him back for future commercials.  My dad used to run an auto restoration business and after providing cars for one film started getting contacted for every vintage film shot within 500 miles.  The funny thing is sometimes he would supply up to ten cars for background shots and would play an extra since they wanted him on set anyway in case one wouldn't start or whatever.  The cars got paid more than he made as an extra and he got to meet Anthony Hopkins and Dakota Fanning
Neat application for that unique little bucket arm tracked unit you acquired.  If you fabricated some mounting points for this function, you might get a lot more of this type of gig.
Andrew:  _Is this yours? Is this something you like?_ Dog:  _What was your first clue?  The whole me being a dog thing?  THROW IT!!!!_
Which local are you in? Down here it's the 478.  Make sure you get the proper compensation, returns, and benefits...
Is a perfect example of everything that's wrong with the world. They could've easily waited for a sunny day just one cameraman and two or three actors. But instead they're going to have a whole production team, honestly kind of sad. If you're trying this hard to sell a blanket, probably means the quality is crap.
Yeah this is the career I’m getting into here
Nice place , is it a rental ? Is it listed ?  Well done for taking it slow haha
I was just thinking Andrew, isn't it time you came up with a livery for all your plant, to create and Andrew Camarata corporate identity?
I have done the same job, i drowe a UNIC 706 spider crane up on a mountain in freezing cold here in Iceland and i had to build a bracket to fasten a lights on. Crazy but fun...
Men love to watch other Men at Work!  LOL.
Awsome #Mecalac11CXi
Good to see a new video.. i needed my fix!
haha i work in film myself. this was fun to watch.
fun fact for y’all, you looking at a 50,000$ light
I'm really doubting whether the tarp over the lamp was a good idea... The lamp looks pretty weatherproof, and obviously it burned a hole into the tarp :P
How you lived your life is what I wanna live my life, independent professional development day-to-day lives. But here in my place it is expensive to afford a life like that. Wanna be there with you man. Love your contents. I subscribed to your channel right now as lately as I found your videos I watched some of them and I feel interesting with it. Keep it up bro.
Tôi ở Việt Nam tôi rất thích những video của anh chúc anh thành công trong công việc cũng như trong cuộc sống chúc anh nhiều sức khỏe 👍
Very flimsy looking lamp, any wind and its done for and back on the ground.
Neat to see the tech behind the camerawork for these guys.
The video reminds me of the movie Zack and Miri Make a Porno. Oh Yea.
I'm more impressed w the flag stone walkway and the glass n that
Arpeggios on point
It started, battery was good, Andrew didn't drop the light from the sky, hydraulics all worked and engine idled like a kitty cat.  I must be watching the Andrew Camarata Bizaro Channel.
You look like Anthony Hopkins
Get this guy to a million subs
That’s one big HMI, it looks like an ARRI 6000W. That’s the light they use to light the background of outdoor night scenes. That generator is not one of the silent types. With silent generator you can only feel the warm air coming out of the  vent holes no sound.
All that and Andrew can get more views than this commercial in an hour. “Nice and slow…. “Do you know who you’re dealing with?
Filming a "commercial" for pornhub...
Hi Andrew - how do you determine how much to charge for jobs like this?
Aka... there shooting a porn vid
That’s what I do for a living. We could use a few Andrews.
I've been working on TV and film doing lighting for 45 years and it interesting to see such a small lift being used. Our machines are generally 60-80' lifts that weigh a LOT the crawler is pretty cool since it can pretty much go anywhere.
A commercial? so much work for just 30 seconds of screenplay and perhaps I'm the most commercial hater in the world, ha ha ha
nice job. others who disagree? fuck em.
Very cool wish it was longer. Always interested in your program’s
Andrew Camarata would be an awesome Werner Herzog right hand
Two different Andrews so far: one Andrew towing a container with a military truck through a closed and muddy forest and another Andrew transporting an expensive light with a super slow lifter. Which do you prefer?
Any video with an Aussie is a perfect video :)
What's the dimension across the front of the house?
Andrew do you like goosenecks?
Nice fake sun!
No wonder things are expensive when they spend mindless amounts of money on commercials. Dogs were great though :)
Amazing light💡 👍🔥🐲
Where's Cody?
Sure sure a "commercial" for an incognito browser activity
👍 👌
Andrew like a lot of us loves Dogs ❤️.
How the hell do you get these jobs?
Fascinating how Andrew totally has his own channel , makes all the decisions, millions of views and a commercial has all those people and stress and on top of that actually have to rent  Andrew to make it work ha ha ! Wow how’s things have changed ! Great video AC  very interesting top man 👍🏻👍🏻
Sheesh the production effort for porn videos these days is huge!!
That is kind of a weird job full on movie crew wow expensive light lol
You know, that darn boom lift is proving a heck of a lot handier than initially intended!
attracting bugs from 5 football fields away lol
i was waiting for a hydrolic line to blow or a track spinning off !
Sweet job!
I don’t know why but I want that lift in a bad way lol
WOW.....Thanks Andrew
that light was smokin that or steam
I think it would be really cool and entertaining for you to rebuild your Isuzu trooper
did Cody have an R.D.O today ?
Sou um grande fã.   Do brazil !
👍👍
Boom working in order, very professionally done, nice job Andrew.
How are those outrigger pads working out for you? Keep up the great videos!
That was a fun change of pace!  Particularly to me as I'm a photographer/videographer.  Those big HMIs are beasts but nothing else replicates sunlight as well. A little disappointed Andrew didn't break out the chainsaw or plasma cutter during the shoot though.
Andrew’s channel: come for the skookum, stay for the dogs.
Anyone else want to see how bright that was going to be in the dark
Man you have some great equipment. I wish you had more time to film cause I would love to see more videos of you using your machines but I know how busy you are so I’ll just say thanks for the extra effort you do to bring us these videos
5 4 3 2 1 Andrew Camarata is GO
I watch Andrews videos as a distraction, it's so nice to dream about another life and now this. Andrew turns up in my everyday life :-)...   Nice seeing American film crews working with european equipment though! Both camera and lights from Arri, way to go!
WAIT a sec, that thing is called "Gruber"?  is that your little tankie??  'ALo 'ALo
they can't wait for the sun to come out?
I am so glad I stumbled across your channel, keep up the good work!
Never mind Thunderbirds, this guy is a one man starship enterprise. If you need a job done just call AC
And in the next episode of "Debbie does Saugerties"
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates_🎈
Number 32 on trending. Congratulations!
Wow, now you can add rigger and key grip to the resume'.
Классный видосик!
I just want to say that we are living in the last days,  and Jesus is coming back very soon. I love y'all and it's just been in my heart to share that Jesus love y'all so much and unconditionally. I don't know how much time we left on this earth before Jesus comes, but I want all of us to be ready when He does. Let's leave these things of this world behind for in scripture it says in Matthew 24:35 that heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear. " Also in 2 corinthians 4:18" So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal." Time is so short. And I always say this" I want all of us to be saved. " Jesus is coming back soon." with tears in my eyes I love you guys. Let's take Jesus and His words seriously in these time were in. I know the road isn't easy because there are so much distractions and temptations in this life. But through prayer and fasting we can overcome them. I'm not trying to force anything on anybody or even force to do something they don't. Everyone has their own choice whether to read or ignore this message. But I'm sending this message to all out of love, because if you were to see your mother about to get hit by a big truck, you would do everything to try and save her because you love her and if you didn't, it show that you don't love her. So I do the same thing for us about the Wrath of God that is to come. I don't want anyone I love, know/don't know or even those who hate or dislike me to face such things. Because I know every soul is precious to God and are valuable to Him. Because before we were born He knew us, He knitted us in our mother's womb, He called us to be His children . His love for us is so great and so strong, it's beyond human comprehension, that even the angels in heaven don't understand it. So I want to tell you it's time to get ready, time to prepare ourselves for the Second Coming of Christ, for the trails and tribulations and for the rapture. As you can see, so many people have turned away from God. The world has become so immoral, wicked, disgusting and violent. Killing people without any care or heart. And that shows that the love of God is growing cold in the hearts of people. Please be ready friends, for when the Son of Man comes. Time is running out. Let's not leave this world with regrets. Because I tell you this, my biggest regret is not knowing Jesus Christ earlier. I love you Guys and Jesus loves you too, that's why He didn't think twice about dying on the Cross for us, knowing that we may not even love Him Back. There are so many signs that Jesus is coming back, I don't know what else I can say but Heaven is real, Hell is real, so is this World coming to an End, is real. Please take what was said today in consideration because ready or not Jesus Christ is coming back believe it or not Jesus is coming back. I love you guys and Jesus loves you too and if you're reading this or even if you ignore this I'll be praying for you. Now, there is still time to turn To Christ, it's doesn't matter how great or how small your sin is, He is always ready to forgive with open arms, because He loves you so much. He can also take away all the pains, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, depression, heart brokenness and so much more if you believe in Him. Nothing can separate us from His unconditional love towards us✝️❤️. Be blessed and be encouraged in the Lord Jesus Christ 🙏❤️  How to be saved? To be saved, a man must confess that Jesus is Lord while acknowledging in his heart that Christ must have full rule over his life and that he died on the cross for our sins and was resurrected on the third day🙏🏾. Also one must repent and turn away from thier sin.   Prayer of Salvation in Jesus Christ🙏  Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, and I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe You died for my sins and rose from the dead. I turn from my sins and invite You to come into my heart and life. I want to trust and follow You as my Lord and Savior. Amen  Spreading the Gospel on every content on YouTube 🙏❤️
That was differently interesting!!!
I see a start of something new with Andrew and commercial's.
I'm glad Andrew's been putting up more content. He's one of the most uncomplicated, hard working young men on YouTube. Oh yeah, and having a wry sense of humor helps too!
1:03 "Just take it nice and slow, Andrew"... There's a man who hasn't watched any of Andrews channel.
SMOKE!!!!!
Andrew, as always, the best from the best - you never disappoint. Having lived in Upstate NY, I can appreciate the northern landscapes and weather - the best time of the year, for me, was Fall. I loved the color, smell, and cool crisp weather and then the hunting and fall fishing could not be beaten anywhere. p.r.morehouse
It's interesting to see how you work around the things you don't know about (referring to past videos) and you are one hell of an intuitive mechanic. You remind me of how it was when I was coming up. I like how when you mess up, you insist on pulling it back down and doing it right. I didn't always do that if I thought it would be okay. You are a better man for that.
Lights, Camera, Camarata as they often say in Hollywood...
looks like a side mission on gta! love the great work!
#18 on trending. Nice.
Florida Man to another Florida Man: Hey, bud, you got a light? ...Sure, let me whip out this little Coleman stove dangling on the end of my 3-foot chrome choke chain.
Makin that movie money! lol  Neat vid , Thanks.
HELLO ANDREW ITS IS RANDY AND I LIKE U VIDEO IS COOL THANKS ANDREW FRIENDS RANDY
Now that’s a job ya could get use to.lol I bet they had to restrain Andrew while they used his lift. He doesn’t do very well standing still with nothing to do.
Film producer: - Andrew, will you give us a spotlight? Andrew: - I will consider ... Cody: - Yeah, let's go!
How much was that light?. I couldn't hear the guy?. TIA.
For a second I was thinking they filming something else ;)
very cool to see the behind the scenes
Круто, а что за фильм снимали? Чел в шляпе режиссер ?
I'm guessing those guys were from IATSE Local 14 in Albany.
After all these years... it's weird hearing the camera talk when Andrew is being filmed.
🇳🇱here you can see again how great the love for dogs/animals is. Greetings from Roosendaal Netherlands.👍👍👍👍👍👍🍀
Time spent with dogs is never wasted.
Hopefully Andrew talked to some of them guys and did a bit of networking. Compared to his normal work, that is about as easy as money comes haha.
That was interesting
fantastic music :-)
See the smoke lol?
You only think that Andrew is involved in making his videos on YT. This shows how much effort he goes to for us. Lol
Hey Andrew, Jesse Muller says the price of scrap iron is way up.  Is it time to go hunting the woods for abandoned trucks and cars?
Its great how you get all these jobs because of the array of equipment you have.
In for the actual commercial
If any are wondering, I am pretty sure that is an ARRI Fresnel 18/12 Daylight fixture. The lamp alone is $23k, the full kit (Ballast, cables ect) is $52k!!!
woah good vid andrew
#18 trending !
No lighting issues on this video
Advertising and marketing are dark arts, and nobody can convince me otherwise. Billions of dollars spent every year essentially to produce more effective ways of brainwashing people. In this case for commercial rather than political reasons.
7:01 HOW much did they say this light is worth? swear i heard a years worth of wages lol
look how FAKE everything has to be to sell crap lol.
Arri HMI 12k ? Very nice.
Shoulda been a B roll video
Not just a big light. A $50,000 Arri HMI. If anybody’s wondering why the crew was so nervous. It’s a rental.
i was thinking it was a porno at first... but they don't put that much effort into pornos
That's an ARRI Daylight 18/12. The light at ballast for that is $52k.
This seems like a lot of work just to shoot a porno... oops, I mean "commercial". 😉
Couple more of those and Andrew can get his union card. :)
I hope you quoted them a BIG price for this, knowing that they have it. Shows you what a Great reputation Andrew has, for some company filming a commercial, calls him!
Andrew is the best on youtube
Wow this video is Trending 🤣👏✨
wow that @orn production has huge $$$$ budget
Very Funny.  Andrew helped Lighthouse Film Producer's with the lighting to shoot a commercial while he made his own movie about using his equipment on their set.
Very cool .you were in the behind the scenes crew helping with lighting.    Your already a  YouTube star and your adding to your resume .    Those dogs were beautiful. There color is amazing .    Thanks for sharing Andrew 👍
That’s an expensive looking light.
**LIGHTING GUYS NEED SOME EXPERIENCE!!!**
Wow. Very cool.   And somehow they manage to keep all of that equipment out of the shots.   I guess that is maybe your first job as a professional stagehand.   I guess you can add this to your list of services.   Well done.
Went back through your channel to see the Bucket Track. Forgot about seeing all together. glad you have it. Kind of specific niche, seems you were needed for that job for sure. So the land wouldn't get torn up and have less of pressure over all on the lawn. That's a great find, I know plenty of bucket trucks. By the way it looks like you can move those ramps in and out to compensate for the width of the loaded equipment. Maybe it might help to do the adjusting yourself next time. 😜
hahahahaha Andrew making  movies
WOW! Camera crew and a Bed - I wondered if they were shooting PORNO films - but we know you're not like that!
Good job👍 that was an expensive light. Good thing you know your machines.
Andrew on trending page congrats
that little tank is amazing
Andrews last video. Wife asks whatcha watching…. “Watching a guy beat the shit out of a shipping container by dragging it up a mountain” today she doesn’t even want to know.
Andrew Hollywood Camarata what next cheers. PS how much is the light i cant here what he says.
Congrats on trending!
Love ur vids Andrew! Really need more of them to never watch anything political again!
Dogs are crazy fun.
Cool job to be a part of. Are they gonna setup at your place next?
When Andrew is #20 on trending. Love your videos man.
Film crew and 200,000 thousand dollars of equipment. Andrew and a 200 dollar gopro.
It’s trending number 21
#21on trending!
So, how did you get involved?
That crawler boom is one of the best things you have bought, can go where nothing else can.   Bet they did not know they were working with an internet legend.
Is there a possibility that someone put in a link when the commercial is ready? I'm curious.......
it's sad to hear Levi is gone.  rip levi.. I'm used to hearing Levi and Cody are on job with me today!!
💓💓💓💓
8:19 I got one of those doggies 😄
Nice to see you working as a grip xD
That's pretty cool they're shooting a commercial. I had to do a delivery to the movie set for public enemy up in manitowish waters Wisconsin at the little Bohemian Lodge
That lift just paid for it self.
I need a dozen of those lights a massive empty warehouse lined with foil and 50000 plants bwahaha
Love the videos Andrew  Greer south Carolina.
Wow only fans is getting professional
The hashtag above claims this video is "#25 trending". Imagine new people subscribing to this channel based on the content of this video having no idea the content of the last video.
Now THATS A FUCKING LIGHT!!!!
When I saw that there was a film crew, then the scene switched to the bed, I was like whoa Nellie, what kind of content is being produced here!?!? lol
Guy at 1:40 is such a chode. Trying to give directions and Andrew isn’t even watching g him. Lololol
Who know, with a little determination and a Hidro-Grubert, a young Camarata would eschew into the film & tv industry…
"What it needed was . . . more power. So I rewired it," Tim 'Tool Man' Taylor.
when the guy operating the equipment gets more views than your actual movie
Little they know, he lives in a castle.
How exciting.  Almost 1M subscribers.
More money spent on marketing than the product. At least it's a steady industry.
I was curious what that light cost... apparently more than some of your equipment.
I remember the time a movie shoot was done in my neighborhood. After midnight they had a gas balloon up about 70’. The light inside the ‘sphere’ turned night into day. Amazing power.
What's the name of this beautiful place
Be a hell of day to have a track come off
at 3 min in.. that light is going to catch fire
I wonder if AC chose the track lift because it was lower impact than his orange telescope forklift? It seemed to me the light was perched somewhat precarious in that basket, whereas he could have arranged a more stable platform on the forklift.
The World: "we need more sunlight!" Andrew: "hold my beer"
Little does the producer know, more people will see this YouTube video instead of his commercial. Doesn’t realize he’s in the presence of a legend lol
Been here since 100k subs ur coming up to 1 mill can’t wait proud of you
So now you're in the filming business.....😆
A sun simulator for the sun simulator that was behind clouds.
I saw the bed, cameras, I was waiting for the pron music to start.....lol
Not gonna lie,  I was hoping the light would stop working, and Andrew would start hitting it with a sledgehammer while everyone was freaking out.
How’d you get that gig? How much did he say that light costs? $20k?
Just think, every time Andrew makes a video, he's singlehandedly doing all the work that this entire crew is doing, PLUS he's actually doing the job itself!
That was fun.
Did these guys watch your other upload with the shipping container move up the hill with your new 4x4 ?
Next up for Andrew  Hollywood    who  should be in Hollywood is  Levi  dogs are man's  best friend
Be you didn't charge enought
Plot twist: The producers know exactly who Andrew is, this IS the commercial. It's a commercial for the light
~~~ That light would be a great addition to The Castle Turret Andrew. Three phase may be a problem unless you set your castle up with it. I couldn't make out what someone was saying that special light cost. This is the first time i seen you use the Crawler Boom Lift on a job. Very interesting video. I never seen how they set up to make commercials or movies before. Thank You for sharing! ~~~
Now he's a roadie, add it to the list.
That looks a bit like a Bren gun carrier
Made yer money back on one photo shoot on that machine
It’s funny… this video will probably have more unique views than whatever commercial they were shooting. Cute aussie tho.
Carbon arc lamps are the shit
4:11 My favorite commercial, bored housewife invites the handyman inside..
This video is on trending! Good stuff Andrew!!
Quality 5K ? I think yes!
I'm a little disappointed they didn't ask Andrew to take out his blowtorch and welding equipment.
That looks expensive. Couldn't they have just waited for a sunny day?
~~~That's the first time i seen him use the crawler. He showed it when he first got it, (dropped a tree on it in the process),..but haven't seen it again until now. It is a super nifty machine! ~~~
found it. $51K light. No wonder that guy was making such a face loading it. lol. Arri 12000/18000W HMI Fresnel Light System with ALF & DMX $51,035.00
Why do I see a "Buying a used quiet running generator" video in the future on Andrew's channel?
Andrew "easy money" Camarata
They used to film a lot of commercials and scenes outside of where I used to work. It's amazing how much is involved, and how much people just standing around there is in 5 or 7 second shots.
imagine the buds you could grow under that thing.
Just ask Andrew he has one of everything! My hero!
Very cool track bucket!!!!! Trump 2024
you want one of those on top of your castle
So that’s how they installed the bat signal
Most talented guy there is running the boom light....jk
That's cool as hell.
Did he say $82,000 for that light? Holy cow.
Nice!
We missed the part where the plumber turns up to fix the housewife's plumbing problem!
How much did the light cost I didn’t hear
I’d watch this guy eat cereal and enjoy it.
Interesting, might be nice to a few more of them.! Thanks Andrew for sharing this update.!
Andrew needs four of these lights to light up the castle so you can see it from 500 miles away!
One day back at the design shop, someone yelled hey we have extra bulldozers track drives and bucket cranes... the rest is legend.
INTERNATIONAL RESCUE.  First 20 seconds.
How did they locate you for the job?   Bet the were suprised to learn you have a bucket truck on tracks! There could be more of these jobs if you'll travel a bit.
Youtube: "Wanna watch a video about hoisting a big light up and shining it through a window?" Me: "i can think of nothing i desire more"
SO CRAZY!! I’ve been watching your videos for years and this is my friends house!!!
How did you manage to get hooked up with a commercial production?
How much did the guy say the light cost at 6:49?  I couldn't hear the first part, just heard "thousand dollars for that light"
#24 on the trending page
Boa noite muito top serviço meu amigo
I can't wait for them to start filming commercials at the steel palace.
I bet those folks loved how Andrew”s equipment left no damage to the owner’s property.
I honestly was waiting for you to say something like “that’s no light, here, let me show you what a light is” you bring in this 800million Jules light.
Beautiful piece of property there........
Right now this video is in the top 25 trending on youtube, how cool is that.
Hello everyone from morocco ^-^
You know the camera crew are star struck when Andrew shows up. Hey its that guy Andrew! omg.
that big light thing is worth an easy 20k
Cool behind the scenes set-up! A very unique job for the tracked boom lift!
Bad@ss
Looks like you're making a PORNO movie .🤣🤣🤣🙄
Andrew “Hollywood” Camarata..
This will have been one of those situations were someone on site will know a guy that might be able to help. ''Oh we need a way to get that light higher''.... 'Well I know this guy called Andrew who has this man lift'
I expect we’ll see more advanced lighting on some future videos.
ad-block made it impossible to watch the second half of Andrews video ?!?!?
Andrew getting involved in the filming industry, I love it!!  *can't believe I spelled filming wrong lol*
Bow chica wow wow!  …… gotta wait for the talent to show up…..😂
장비 관리를 안해서 녹이 곳곳이 슬었네
Never knew how much work went into making porn
Such beautiful country, thank you for your videos.
This video is actually a wonderful contrast between commercial content, and what Andrew, and other Youtubers like him, do.  It takes these “professionals“ mountains of equipment and truckloads of manpower to film a 30 second spot.  They will set up the shot for hours. Meanwhile, Andrew puts out amazing content all by himself. He does his own filming and editing, while also running his own company.
Hope you got Cody in the film
Is that the person you did something about the septic field clearing and driveway stuff for about 3 years ago? I think it was the first job with the big dump truck.
What was the guy in the red shirt throwing at you at 7:34?
Little did they know the real star was behind the scenes supplying the equipment
Huh, something different. A little out of the ordinary. You need that every once in a while. Pretty cool.
#25 ON TRENDING  Wow!!
Andrew's next purchase will be a an old spotlight from WW2 and make it work better than new!!
U should buy a surplus military geny with the cat motors. Also cleanest pair of pants
THEY have a crew of 30 and costly to produce, Andrew is one man.  His videos are far beyond their crap.
Andrew: You are branching out into a new field.  Are they giving you a Grip Credit?
Right tool for the job!
Great job! I looked up that spotlight, geezzzzz!! $23,000-33,000 dollars! No wonder you guys were nice and slow. 👍🏼👍🏼😣
That was something different for you I could open up doors and opportunities of doing different kinds of work with that little machine good stuff. 👍👍😀🇨🇦
Who thought Andrew of all people world go Hollywood on us. 😆
2:50 The Light was smoking!  Oh it was steam.
If Cody was on this job he would've been on that bed for sure.😂
Nice back story about making the beds and they needed a little light. We all know what is going on here, they are contacting Aliens from outside of our solar system with that giant light.
Next video, Buying and modifying a sun..
this represent ....  = "Never trust TV" !!!
Guy sounded like he was describing filming a pr0n scene. Lol
YES.......A new vid.....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Probably the first movie set for this machine 😁
Awesome AC
And you didn't even have to weld, grind or  cut anything........looks like it was a boring day for you !!!!   LOL......But my job is running a Broadway theater in NYC....so that was as easy as it gets !!!
Andrew always something different and staying busy for sure
Andrew reminds me of the "Thunder Birds", a different machine for what ever problem comes along.
He didn't tell anyone they are doing it wrong or offered to modify anything. Very disappointing lol
love it
YOU ON THE TRENIDNG PAGE!!!!!! LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
That’s something that most of us wouldn’t have seen before. If the dogs were in the commercial it’ll be a success.
#28 on trending  !!  Go Andrew  !! Go Andrew  !!
good job boss..........
how'd you even get involved with something like this?
Satanic dogs ..one killed a baby in his cot a few weeks ago in AUS ..evil..
ALL THAT OVER BED SHEETS!
5;30 oh ok ,
My blue heeler says this is his favorite AC video
Just call him Hollywood now.
in this weeks episode Andrew is asked to assist in filming a commercial, not having the equipment he needs to do the job...he rushes out and buys one....in next weeks episode we will see all of the modifications he made to make things possible.
Cool project how did you get in touch with those guys?
3 phase sunshine, bright ass light. Beautiful pup that walked up, i want one of those bad.
What was smoking on that light?
Please no more ads
Heck yeah Andrew you're on trending! I love these videos as usual man
used to run those jennies for days . you can sleep with those running
if shit hits the fan this a dude I wanna know.
Andrew needs to hang with matt carricker the demo ranch guy they could both teach eachother stuff
Cool content.  So much effort for a set of bed sheets.  Imagine how many pillow cases they have to sell just to cover this
2 videos in one week? Aw you shouldnt have.
How much did he say the light cost?
You see that commercial knowing Andrew had a part in it
Andrew Camarata and his wonder dog Cody, Crime fighters, earth moving, and Stihl stereo installation.
Welcome to the pretend world
Anyone notice the light was smoking 🤫
Theres huge money in the movie stuff.. My dad knew a buddy from high school who started very small, with cranes and so on, and now he is one of the biggest suppliers in Toronto Canada.
Love it!
dogs are the best. no wonder bed sheet's and pillow case's cost a arm and a leg.
they better not forget to add Andrew on the credit list
just gonna try it again with more violence
They managed to unload the light without Andrew using an oxygen acetylene torch but I am sure he was ready with one
What breed of dog were in the vid. Great stuff Andrew
Was that steam or smoke coming off the light?
👍🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🗽🙏🏻 Enjoyed!  You never know what to expect from Andrew!
I would love to have one of those. God bless Kansas
getting in to the film industry even just helping out is cool
You made it to the movies ,just knew you would. Great job Andrew
Cody would have played.
The first time you work on film. T.V. or commercial production. Your on there list of assets. And when your in you will be called from time to time. I was asked to help out in a very small way on a history channel project 35 years ago. From there I have got work on three movies two more things for the history channel and a long running T.V. show on and off camera. Thing is you don't know what your working on haft the time. You go here do this reset and do this and your done and get a check. And they tend to pay good and fast.
Andrew has done it again! Great content and generates a million ideas from his subs. Thanks for the shorty and take care!
Hope to see your name in the generic :o)))))
I bet that was a nice pay day
So now do you have to join the union cos you worked on a TV commercial film shoot? When I worked for Microsoft  I supplied  MP3  players for  a Target  TV  commercial  at The Lot film studio. Most of the day was sitting around setting lights and sets. Long day to shoot two 30 sec. commercials.
At the last minuet the producer comes to realize that Tom Cruise just isn't the right man  for the scene, and puts in up and coming you tube sensation Andrew Camarata.
Very Kool....
might this guy be in the witness protection program out of nyc
Andrew could run over the bed with a skid steer and would sell more of them then this commercial will
man talk about a deer in the headlights you actually could use one of these at the castle. be great toy to use during the zombie apocalypse no
ok where you been hiding this toy or is it a rental
Nice to see that the Porn Industry is still alive and well in Upstate New York. L😂L!
It's the perfect machine for the job!
You certainly do have just about every tool for the job.. that’s for sure
Nothing beats an honest earning. Thanks for sharing Andrew. 8:04 Living the moment.
For real!!!!!!!
Uneasy about the “steam” coming off the plastic cover over the light? Enlightening.
Wow, that ATV Lifting Car is payoff finally.
So, how long before Andrew has a generator like that??!!??
Guy tells him the price of the light AFTER Andrew moves it! Lol
Do these people know who they just asked to use precision care for their very expensive lighting system? Do they even know that they have turned the Tasmanian devil loose inside of a crystal store?
I thought someone was going to spotlight deer a few miles away at night.
In NY they need to install your own sun.
18000 watts metal halide. Whoa.
All the people who downvoted are vampires.
I wonder if that film crew realised that 'crane guy' is actually a bigger movie producer then they are 🙂
I wonder how Andrew got this gig haha
Cool video.
Just the sticker on that light cost a lot!! 😂
Saw the bed and thought, porn shoot!    YES!!! lol
Very interesting insight 🤔into the making of the garbage that passes for 99% of commercials made these days. So many ants doing their little parts for 10-60 seconds of airtime😳😨. The stars of the show as usual though are the puppers🥰.
I look forward to seeing Cody's commercial.
Andrew.... we've already noticed all the camera work you are doing... stopping your truck... setting up a shot... going back and driving by (like Casey Neistat did with his running). What's next... You buy this light so you can set up shots at the castle during bad weather? LOL.. I have no doubt the quality of your videos will improve. Just don't want you to think all the extra work you have been doing on them is going unnoticed.
"Hey Andrew, we got a job for you", "Will there be dogs?", "Yes!", "I accept"!
Cool content! Different! Hope you get another one of these jobs.
No hammers,no pry bars,no welding gear..Shocked,horrified...Way out of comfort zone 🤣🤣🤣💯💯💯
Anyone notice the smoke coming off that light?
some of those advert producers would be happy with your viewing figures Andrew
They should have been there to film Andrew moving the shipping container to the mountain top.
Recent videos appear to show Andrew having assistance with videography, this ones understandable with all the film making crew there.....great shots!
I am a simple guy every time I see a new Camarata video. I click play.
I bet you andrew could sell more bed sheets than this commercial will
What? No Cody?????
Awesome  dude...love your tracks  lift...
Making sunlight in the rain?  Always a new adventure with Andrew.  Never quite sure what we're gonna see!!
Hey we need to meet , you with all your neat equipment and men who loves equipment !
Andrew...you are in the movies!
Disappointing - no large hammer or chainsaw action!!
Word is, on the way out driver drove into a massive pot hole and the light broke.
does it need the chainsaw ?  niiice shack btw
Andrew, one of your videos you saw levi's brother is he alive?
Next video Andrew makes that quiet generator will be in his shop.
Craft Services :)
That's some grippery, right there. Who would have thought you'd be a Condor operator? Next you'll be wanting to buy a used grip truck.
Thats so great you got to be involved in this.  I had seen 5 movies being made.  Biggest one was Hunt for Red October. was on the Ever Ready what the crew called it after the 9 volt battery FFG 9 while they filmed it. was 800 yards from that explosion.
Is it a AirBnB? Looks like an awesome and beautiful space to enjoy some time!
144 dislikes? That's the same amount of votes Biden actually got...
What an awesome place to have a cabin out in the middle of nowhere nothing but trees that would be awesome
Every video Andrew makes is a spellbinder. Awesome versatility and eagerness to tackle any kind of project is amazing..👍👍👍
Andrew, we expect better lighting on your shoots now.
I bet Andrew buys one of those lights.
A BFL for sure
Pornhub production ?
Andrew in the filming business, unbelievable, that's great . Nice one Andrew.
That light costs as much as a used car.
Intriguing Andrew
If anyone gets the chance to work behind the scenes in TV, movie or any other entertainment setting, I'd say do it. It's hard work, but you'll learn how to work in a team, pick up some new skills and have a great time.
why does everybody assume that the film company is out of California? NYC is 2 hours away.
6:48 how much?
"Drive slow" - Lighting director "Have you seen my channel?" - Andrew
That's like a portable sun.
Aren't you glad he told you what the light cost AFTER you moved it?   :-0
more toys!!!!.... weeeeee!.... thanks 4 video. be kind.
Super cool job to get called out on. They definitely found the guy with the right equipment.
thats the shadiest money tree i have ever seen.
Andrew Camarata,  Hollywoods newest movie star.
108,280 views and over 10,000 likes in 4hours not bad Andrew.
Andrew shows them his industrial bedroom with a view.....Pack it up we're moving to a new location
Woow👍👍
Now that was cool.         how did you get the job                                                            just wondering
Big budget commercial… I hope you have a big chunk of it!
Not far away the sound of a big husky toppling a dead tree....Production stops Andrew aw my bad just saw this dead tree and......
even PORNHUB knows Andrew would get the job done!
Was there this much equipment and camera crew when Neil Armstrong and the other astronauts was filmed when they walked on the moon?
Hope you got a free duvet out of it!
That light draws 18,000W.
Sure... They are lighting up the bed room for a "commercial". Can I get the link for the "commercial" asking for a friend. 😂
Those are 'Australian Sheep Dogs', and they are some of the loudest animals on this planet, Andrew.  My neighbor had one for about a year and it never failed to bark at ANYTHING.  Sheesh...well, I guess people like those, eh?  👂🧗‍♂️🏃‍♂️💇‍♂️
The most boring Andrew video yet. Only because this is my world, and it’s gotten old for me.  That said if I ever film upstate I’ll certainly think of a way to bring you on set.
Beam me up Andrew
Andrew, putting a sun into the sky....
Andrew wants a diesel generator next.. He'll find one, military surplus or government auction..
When the whole thing started wobble with the light... did they put sandbags at the bottom?
That Arri 18 K HMI is a couple of bucks...lol...I used to do production work for 30 years
Neat video. It gives some perspective about what it takes to get a shot set up for TV or Movies. Playing catch with the dogs was cool also.
This was really cool!
Started the video, no audio. ☹️ Checked everything played another then played it. It worked Idk.  Probably a fresnel lens on that light. No par cans in use. Tv is different then theater.
Interesting backstage views
"I did a cool thing today... Oh look... PUPPIES!"  Thanks for sharing!
That machine is awesome!
That fixture is made by ARRI, a company that's been around in film production for over 100 years, and it costs at least $20,000.
Looked more like they were gonna film porn than a commercial.
That's awesome. Good job.
what did he say that light cost? 100k?
you are a star
At first I thought he was putting a light inside a house but now I think he’s helping film some sort of commercial
When he was explaining about the problems with the sun moving I was just waiting for you to say “We’ll you know I could probably just move the house for you if you want…”
Amazing
"Commercial".  We all know this was for Brazzers!
Huh, gonna think about how much work goes into lighting the next time i watch a porn.
Little did they know Andrew would've done that job for free if they let him play with those dogs for atleast one full hour 🤣👍
Guys how do we celebrate 1M followers ?
Did they make you get an actor’s guild card?
That must be one hot light it was steaming when it was up.
anyone notice the light is smoking?
00:40 Jesus, that´s not a generator for the light, that IS the light!
Sun...?  We don't need no stinkin' sun.
It's a Comercial being filmed , but Andrew  is the star behind the scenes. Hugs for Cody ❤
I need this to clean my gutters every year!
Someone: Why are there 4 guys unloading that light?" Guy: Labor is cheap, that light isn't!
Such a niche machine but when you need it for something. It proves to be very useful
I love the look of that Tiny House, also has a great view. Andrew gets to do all the cool stuff.
"What color should we paint this piece of heavy equipment?"   Seafoam Blue!
Where did you pick up that Toy?
The makings of Debbie does upstate ny🙀🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️😵...... .........👋🤪🤙.......
Just waiting for Andrew to say, “ if you need any small modifications making, I have brought my Chainsaw with me.”
He's like "007" of the Empire State
Nice lights for a porno shoot 🤣💥
You didn't get video of the food truck that provides meals for the crew?  That's the best part!!
Not just the light, it powers the whole production crew equipment, been there..
Ahhhhh Filming a Porn !!  hahahaha  #BoogieNights
That was fun to watch.
EVEN HOLLYWOOD CALLS ON ANDREW TO GET THE JOB DONE!
shooting a pron?
How much for that light?
I don't doubt more people are watching this behind the scenes voluntarily than the commercial itself on TV ...
To be honest I was hoping you would bring out the welder or the torch to fix the big light. Maybe next time😁
You just never know what you will get a call for, But I know a guy !!😂
Was really cool hearing him explain what was going on and how it all works.
Need to put the Batman symbol on that light! 💥🖐
How it going today andrew
Andrew  is getting  to the point that he can tackle  any job you could imagine
I just checked the price of that Arrimax 18/12 light. Hold onto your undershorts, $27,000. That's right, 27 thousand bucks! Yipes, if that bucket decided to tip over. Thanks for the video. Hope to see you on the silver screen. Jon
Andrew Camarata: portable sun for hire.
The light is on fire.
Very cool, that light is very specialized to simulate sunlight at 56K
Pretty cool behind the scenes look. Now you can say you have lifted the Sun with your crawler boom.
Camarata Property Maintenance and Multimedia Productions
This is where Andrew gives the Producer some editing tips 😂👍🏽
That was pretty cool! They've been doing a bunch of filming recently in my area for some new Netflix show, I've seen a bunch of those lights in action while they film in the evening/night time.
Cody should have come along.  He could have gotten his own commercial.
Not your usual type of video, but cool nonetheless. Didn't think you'd work this type of job as well
Next video: Installing a new headlight on my Yanmar 😁😁
This was the perfect video for my lunch break!
Why don't they just puta Go-pro on a tripod and call it a day ?!? 🤣🤣
Next video: Buying a big three-phase generator
I like that when Andrew pulls out one of his toy and play with it for us LOL !
Hi I woch your videos everyday tell the team I said hi and I woch thor videos everyday I love you guys I love the video
Ouch....   who saw the bed and thought  Holy cow they are going to shoot a porn.
Just because I was curious and looked up the price of that light. That thing cost close to $25,000! lol
Always new surprise with Andrew. I'm a 68 year old retired teacher and this is one of my favorite channels.  Andrew is such an independent go getter.
Porn shoot
Andrew, do you own that piece of equipment also? I think you own one of everything, or that's the goal anyway....
my first thought when they were talking about the price of the light is that Andrew is going to have one on top of the workshop that he built for about $50
This is one job Cody definitely couldn't be on.
You do get some interesting jobs.
that's alot of lighting for a porn shoot
Cool twist of the day and life of Andrew.
I wonder if you would soon make a review or repair video of that machine sooner...im a big fan of yours...keep going...
In contrast to all the massive projects Camarata has taken on and filmed solo, it is funny to hear this cat talk about "all" the stuff they have to do to film this commercial, with a full team no less.
Big A$$ light but its wimpy stand would have been the first thing to break off. Its good theat they put ALL the ratchet- straps on there :)
And here I thought we will witness Andrew’s engagement party!
I knew Andrew was up to somthing big out directing real real movies 🎥 👌 lol keep them coming alsome work always interesting and entertaining.
Great job as always Andrew!!
what commercial where they filming
Here in Spain there is no need for a powerful focus, we have enough sun, the problem is that we are far from there and the coronavirus is rampant.
This video of setting up a light for a commercial shot will get more views and interest than the resulting commercial will..
How were you hired for this?
This might be the only Andrew Camarata video that doesn't involve the use of a BFH. Historic!
Part of a filming crew now Andrew, is there no end to your talent's??? What a great day for you, thanks for sharing.
how cool is this?
I’ve always loved film sets, what a cool gig.
Andrew you should get a kubota Excavator and SVL 95 skids steer
Sometimes miss his dog when don't see him.
lol, the generator has 125% fuel.
A man should expand their horizons.
that was a beautiful dog
Pretty cool job Andrew, thanks for sharing it with us. 😎
Did Andrew upgrade the YouTube gear lol, that light probably cost more than the machine he used to move it. Can’t wait for the videos on that machine
Good experience for you.
There must have been an adult film there  :D
Well done Andrew!
the light is on fire
You must have a hell of a agent I thought these production jobs were all close shop (union) jobs.
This coolness !!  Good Job Andrew! The go guy !Cheers!;-)!!
I work in the entertainment lighting industry it’s very interesting to see worlds collide on this channel. Keep up the great work Andrew!
8:00 Bet Cody was jealous when you got home.
I worked on lots of movie sets , one time had to make dust on a road with a bobcat  scrapping the ground , then they drove a car down it . Easy work good pay.
That crawler boom is a cool unit. Hope there is a video coming about fixing it up because we have seen it NOT looking like that! Those are always fun.
Hopefully the film crew appreciated to talk to one of the most famous movie directors :)
Did that lamp just pull 30kw?
cool
Do you have a special one million subscriber video planned???  It should only be a few months away.
Thanks for sharing a new video on an interesting topic.👍
This was really cool
Action....
Love these shorter videos, hopefully it means we will get more of them
Andrew time
I am surprised they let you film on set. These people are usually dicks about that stuff.
Kool day??
Vitor tor Lortugal 👍👍🤬🤬🤣🤣😎😎🇵🇹🇵🇹
Knowing Andrew those guys would have freaked if he told him how much he paid for that lift, lol. 18k for the light, lol. Well it’s being lifted by a 7k home made lift.
Hay algo que este hombre no haga bien jaja
The sun don't shine, so Andrew fix it
A sawsall and a welder, Andrew could have shed some light with that fixture! 💡💡🎬🎥
You'd be amazed how much money I've had to pay neighbors over the noise from those generators. Back in the 90s guys had some really sweet rigs for grip and stuff, but now the business is so cheap, you don't see it as much. Except for the big shows. Musco is one of the biggest portable lighting companies. They have some huge trucks.
Andrew is going Hollywood.
How can it be heavy, it's a light?
That was cool, interesting too. Good to see what goes on in the background for a change, normally a punter here. In London sometime back they were filming an advert in a cureency dealers in the City of London, I did the IT for them. The lifts were wall climbers and the lighting at the bottom vibrated a lot. You could feel it through the air, huge power, but less than 18k, more like 8 I think. Forget what the ad was for, but it included a model who was constantly taking her clothes off in the lift, the audience was large :)
CAMARATA: the movie. Coming to a theater near you soon.
Andrew once again delivers us an interesting videos with a cool utility vehicle.
Yeah.. a commercial..  Probably a ponr set!
So glad I wandered upon this channel! Always something new & Interesting ( Atleast to me) Glad I subbed!
Next video...”check out this 3-phase generator I got, listen to how quiet it is”
Cool... :-)
Movie set…?
Film crew comes to town. Head grip asks in the gas station: -"Anyone around here that have a bunch of equipment?"👍😉
Not sure why my previous comment was deleted :-( I said something nice.
02:25 Damn, look at it steaming
Well that was out of the norm definitely a odd job
awww poor cody missing the ball action
glad you got that gig for a commercial! maybe buy/make an attachment for the lift to remove the bucket and just place the 18k light?
Looks like a cool experience.
Good use of the truck 🇬🇧🇬🇧👍👍
Now we're film crew are we nice See that smoke come off that light gggsss  Get that vehicle painted its showing you up
So awesome, what a beam !!
You get what you paid for - and I'm sure that photo shoot was top notch. That was a lot of money just looking at all the people and equipment.
Andy did you ask what type of films they were shooting, middle of nowhere log cabin unmade beds ladies about, the mind boggles, pretty sure the signwriting on the truck said Top Shelf whoops.
what a waste of time and money for a commercial........i bet andrew could have done the same end product with pennies
awesome video
add movie and commercial equipment support to the list of things you do XD
Hollywood Camarata
The perfect machine for lifting a light and not destroying the grass to do it.
Are you planning on sharing a link to the commercial when it comes out? We would love to see it!
How long before Andrew makes his own high power light fitting from a V8 motor and welding gear.
Andrew, Thanks for the view into "commercial making"...  Nice "clean up" B.T.W. ...   P.S.  You would HATE California...
ARRI makes some cool stuff...
Did you happen to mention that you had a Castle should they ever need one in the films, you should have been in front of the  lighting Andy not behind it, great vid different, oh and that you do great aerial drone shots if they need them. cheers buddy.
Love the smoke coming off the light
did the plastic catch on fire?
Hope Andrew got scale for that job.
Is there a link to the commercial on here?
Are you going to buy a light like that so you can have an inland lighthouse in rural upstate NY?
“Take it nice and slow Andrew” famous last words.
Pretty cool to see what goes into making a commercial.
Interesting behind the movie scene, seeing how much has to happen to get things right.  Another item in Andrew's job portfolio.
did anybody here how much the light costs. I couldn't make it out and there was no option for caption
Anyone know what type of dogs were at the end?
THANKS!
Andrew show them your place with a view ,now that would be a great commercial.
"just take it nice and slow andrew" lol this guy must know him
At first I thought this was pictures for selling the house.. would have been pretty crappy if you bought it and the sun never rises through that window.. lol .. but then I heard the end conversation.. major lengths for product videos, must be expensive bedding material!!
just another day, good job!
Given how expensive that light is, I feel like there could be a much more secure mounting solution in the bucket...
The easiest I have ever seen Andrew operate equipment. lol Good Job!!
Video crew + lights + bed = NOT corn
And Andrew has just been duped into sitting up lighting for a movie called "Hairy Bears on Vacation, Big Logs Episode.
Pretty cool video.  Right at the end, though... that dog's face:  nothing was more important, or enjoyable than chasing that ball.  Gotta smile at that.
So many kinds job. I’ve enjoyed too 👍
How much for that gig I wonder?
this video will probably get more views than their commercial
That looks like a porno bedroom shoot lol
I just bought one of those lights from Home Depot. It was in their clearance aisle for $99.99+ tax. I hope I got a bargain!
I used to run a 115 foot sign crane and they put a man and a 10 k light in my basket and I would shoot him up about 35 feet and lock my brake down till lunch we shot all night for 2 weeks. Easiest job I ever done. My truck was placed in the middle of where they had all the food set up and the stars was just walking around talking to each other and they told me to eat what ever I wanted.
Andrew could make a better commercial than them using his cell phone.
How many people does it take to drape a blanket on a chair? 1 and then an 18 chief committee to approve it...  Don't change your approach to film making Andrew - with almost a million subscribers you could teach these fools lots.  Sorry - all those people in black made me snarky... :))))
Arri, the company that makes that light and other equipment there, is from here in Munich, I nearly wound up working for them, but decided otherwise.
Well I didn’t expect this! Wow Andrew this was a surprise. Very cool to be involved with this.
Andrew, " You know I could have built you a sun." "Why don't we just rotate the house?"
Glad to see more from you andrew great no captain codie today a lol take care out there ok 👍👍👍
Hey this is what I do for a living!  Cool to see these worlds come together
Glad to see more from you andrew great no captain codie today a lol take care out there ok 👍👍👍
8.5 minutes? Come on man I need an hr or so.
Where are the hammer and torch? I want to learn how to professionally arrange a blanket over a chair. I bet that job pays union wages.
nothing went wrong or needed fixing!
It really is amazing to see all the people it takes to film TV/Commercial/Movies.  Lot's of energy and activity.
When they tried to get the lamp off the stand at the end, Andrew could have suggested " pull it more violently" and if it fell just tell the boss "it broke for no reason"
What can i say that hasn't already been said. "it's Andrew!" nothing surprises me when he posts a video. great job Andrew. Don 't know who's dogs they were. but God sent them along for you!. to play with. Thanks for sharing.
I do not miss being in the camera dept for iatse669.  I was a slave.  I make more money with crypto and stay home with my kids.  Too many focus pullers seeing their kids for 10mins on their 1 break.  Gross.  Babylon worship.  Hang out in space ships, living the dream with a new family.  Your old one is sitting at home waiting for your 15hr day to be over.
Next video:  "Modifying my new 100kW generator truck."
thats a HUGE ASS LIGHT
Andrew got a summer job working for a Key Grip.
Haha, can't wait until Andrew starts investing in high-end lighting equipment for his shots and starts hauling it to the jobsites.
Cool experience for you. Super interesting.  Is that the first time you have been hired for something like that?  A commercial I mean.  Also, I hope you got paid well considering they have a $120,000 light.
Tks.
"Thunderbirds are go!"
One dog says to the other"Was that the legendary Andrew Cramata?  I really thought he was an urban legend.  But no, he really exists, and I got to play fetch with him.  Oh how I envy the life of Levis. I guess there really is a heaven on earth and I was in it for a few minutes"
Probably minimum wage workers.
We put the main road into that development and did 24 house sites up there, including the one you're working at. Super cool to see it completed and lived in! Keep up the good work!
This is more entertaining and not annoying than any "comercial"....
The more content the better! Best youtuber by far
funny fact, this guys have no clue what kind of humble celebrity was helping them... If they only knew... our Uncle Camarata makes greater movies than the entire Holiwood.
hi Andrew thank you for all the great content. You said your truck is a 2002 but I think its a 2003 check on the door sticker and did that red maple survive or did it die?
WHAT WAS THE JOB OR OBJECT OF THIS VIDEO.
Firslty, while that genny is quiet, I've seen some that are literally just a whisper! Crazy what can be done!  Secondly, I'd talk to the production boys and tell them that if they wanted to give you regular business, you could make a proper mount for the lighting rig on the end of the boom, not strap it onto a wobbly tripod! Odds are they probably need this sort of thing all the time, and you can make good money renting it out!
Man I bet you can relax/vaca the rest of the year from that job.
Man I thought for sure a xxx film was gunna be made .🤣🤣
Something different, great video
THIS VIDEO WAS SO DAMN CONFUSING TO FOLLOW ***DR KEL
that is going be a hell of an overpriced duvet ...
More like lifting up the SUN
Kohler generators are the best. Those guys are from branchburg. Small world.
Andrew drives more tracked vehicles than a tank pilot. Nice job, crazy large lamp, nice house, fun dogs. Thanks!
I feel great for you Andrew that you have lots of work and I wouldn’t want to change that. But It always hits me in the heart to see the beginning of the land being carved out for human consumption. Thats progress/ population booms and people have to live somewhere. At least it looks like people are leaving many trees on their property and have good buffers between the next home. Most people live there for the nature so hears hoping they preserve what they own.
Them Hollywood types needto look at Andrews body of film work. He ain't just a gaffer!
I knew Andrew had a gentle side, he did not break or cut anything, so proud of him today, wink
WONDER WHAT WILL GET MORE VIEWS THIS OR THE COMMERCIAL?
Thats pretty cool Andrew..... We've been working on a movie set for almost 3 weeks. A Mini series.... filming starts last week of august.... we still have a week of work to complete...it's very exciting.... I can give more details later...cant let the cat out of the bag right now though.... Cheers, Blessings!!
Simple video, unique content and happy dogs at the end. Gotta love it.
Almost 1M subscribers hell yeah
Lights camera, action.
Cool project!  You had the perfect machine for the job.  Big enough to handle the weight, but small enough for easy maneuverability - and no damage to the yard.  Well done.  💪👍🏼
WE NEED TO PUSH ANDREW OVER THE ONE MILLION MARK!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IF ANYTHING BROKE, ANDREW COULD WELD IT BACK TOGETHER AND IT WOULD AUTOMATIC BE BETTER WITH ALL THE DESIGN FAULS TAKEN OUT OF IT!!!!! RIGHT ANDREW!!!! WE NEED TO PUSH ANDREW OVER THE ONE MILLION MARK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Love the videos man, chin up and work on. 😃
Does anyone know what the commercial was all about??
As the light sets the plastic sheet a blaze...
Well he does have a lot of stuff.
My my, what a big one! Definitely one of the largest I've ever seen! Wow! 😉😀😁😅😂🤣😉
Andrew is the one man version of actor, operator, producer, camera man, director, editor and so on.....
Once you let a dog or throw their ball, you will be busy keeping them happy. My cousin is a carpenter his rule is never pay any attention to them or you won’t get any work done. That means I don’t get any work done.
The light definitely looked like it was smoking, probably burning that plastic
You know you're in New York when you have to simulate sunlight.
My wife works in the industry, amassing how it all works and the people I've talked to.
@Andrew Camarata  what kind of track is playing at 2.40 min?
Do you think Cody will make it into the credits of this comercial? Let's be honest it would not have been possible without his moral support.
Great to see ya Andrew 😀
Man, when u bought that thing,  i'll bet a whole bunch of us didnt thing "THIS" was how u were gonna use it !  Painting stuff, repairing stuff, trimming trees, but nope, not as a lighting placer for a commercial or possable movie set,  wow !!!   Plus was cody there "helping"??  Lol !
Andrew channel is awesome, I don't know how to describe it but you never know what the next video will be. The content is not consistent but neither is life!    Forever subscribed.
It was only a matter of time before Andrew went all Hollywood on us.
Im betting Andrew was definitely watching them like a hawk to come up with any tips that would help him make better videos for us fans!
Those Arri daylights get near as hot as the sun.
Interesting
Way to go bro you'll be getting your million subscribers youtube soon enough that's a big mile stone congrats
👍👌👏
Some long cords for the light
Movie 🎥 guy what’s next
Some of the best videos on the Tube.
Those lights looked so cool
It’s kind of cool you can see the smoke coming off the top of it
good driving, surprisingly so smooth at 'move off' .  worked really well for what they wanted
What are the odds that this video is going to be viewed more than that commercial
I was hoping to see the gas torch come out!
Director: we need a special gadget to hold fake sunlight in a window at a weird angle. Producer: call Andrew!
Is the light supposed to smoke like that?
thats one expensive light
@3:27  Fuel Level 125%   Damn...that generator was super quiet!
Few years ago I saw something being filmed in downtown Boston.  There were like 8 eighteen wheelers full of equipment, lights ,  booms ,shades of every shape and size. They also had a water truck the size of a gas tanker to run water down the sidewalk and street to make it look like it just rained. I found out later that it took 12 hours to set up the lighting and sound and whatever and the the whole scene lasts like 2 1/2 minutes of film time.
Thanks Andrew. You inspired me to get s cherry picker as I have wanted one for years seeing you tackle any break down or faults with your equipment made me feel I could sort some potential problems out myself. So this video is extra special. Keep going mate
How much for that light
I totally forgot you purchased that boom lift, lol.
did we know you bought this?
I spent 40 years in that business.  Don't miss it at all...
👍👍👍
Spielberg's on the phone .. He needs some gear.
If this isn't the set of CAMARATA: THE MOVIE then I'm gonna be very disappointed! A three hour IMAX epic
just a behind the scenes shot of Andrew's production team...
OH NO, a driving light for Andrew's ATV comin' up!
Hollywood!  Very Interesting.
Cody could be a rock star on that bed.
I like the man lift . its so compact . how much was that ?
Andrew how'd you get this gig ? This was interesting !  You're obviously a more complex individual than meets the eye
That's how ya make friends with a dog! :D
can u do an equipment tour one time?
Waiting for the commercial to come out and we find out Andrew is the "talent" referred to 😆
You have an interesting life for sure Andrew
I like that moshine it's cool
Actually what I appreciate about your videos is that just by reading the description I know exactly what I’ll be watching.
Remember, you said to us something in the lines of "this might become handy some day" and as always, you where correct, extremely cool to see this, I had no idea how this was done without you! :)
(:
Wow that was nerve racking .good thing you didn't know what it cost before you started moving it lol . Good job Andrew
I dont see Andrew owning a TV to watch the commercial.
Nice! We always new his future was BRIGHT! 🤪👍
Thank you for posting an odd job. Haven't seen much of you lately. You do have a large audience that enjoys your activities. God Bless you Andrew
Так вот как гей  порно снимается.
Knowledge is a wonderful thing, thanks Andrew keep them coming. 👍 Very interesting short📹🎥🗽🇺🇸
I can imagine the "behind the scenes" conversation. Director: "this will be seen by hundreds of people a day..." Andrew: Awe, thats cute, i had 30K views in 2 hours on this video...
Next video: l bought a quiet 3 phase generator.
Что за фильм снимают андрюха
Andrew, time to get involved with IATSE.
Next Andrew purchase? Klieg lights.
A fun day out
Lights camera Andrew
Nice Andrew. Your Hollywood now.  Always a great day when your videos show up.. I find it difficult to believe that so many Slugs give a thumbs down. Shame On Them !
Andrew’s video will probably get more views than the actual commercial.
Emmy Award coming soon....(:
Was really glad to see new video.  Have watched almost everyone over and over
Congratulations on expanding your customer base.  I'll bet they keep you in mind for future shoots.
Ролик называется: Вы присутствовали на съёмках порнографического кино.
Andrew, was that one of the houses you had something to do with it’s building or driveway or something? Guess those advertising agencies make a lot of money on making those commercials in order to have/hire such large film crews!
howd you get this job Andrew!???
That advertiser should sponsor this video 😂
ARRI light 😍😍😍
Have we seen that lift before? Would like to know more about it. Looks cool
Interesting.
Goodbye when you bought that machine good job well done
What was the commercial for?
Well that was interesting and different.
Future video topic "Andrew buys the quietest generator and sun level spot light on Craigs List." Learned something new about lighting from this vid.
The magic of comercials....
Did you tell them u basically have a million followers?
What did that guy say that light cost?  20,000 dollars?  Pro level video production is expensive.  Andrew shoots pro level videos for less.
Well, that's certainly an upgrade on the usual Gopro set up...
What an absolute chonker of a light
Andrew, 8 whole minutes and you didn't break anything. Very impressive
i want to live in that house with that ligt shine on me 24/7 :p
I'm amazed at such a big heavy Light and a shitty, wobbly mounting Stub bracket.
Branching out into porn. Nice!
3:25 I wish my generator had 125% fuel!
Camarata Construction, Have sun, will travel!
Hadnt seen that machine since you bought it. I figured you sold it.
Hollywood calling?
I love working for film crews, they always feed you.
Andrew how many machines to you have?  Never seen that one before?
Ha now you are in the big times ,
This is a pretty cool gig Andrew, are you a movie star now? lol. Good job buddy. Nice to see the crawler in action.
Boogie Nights Part 2?
More content? Soo soon after the otherone? ILOVE IT!!!!! New content every week, just post it uncut 👍🏻❤️
I can't believe all the shots he gives us in one video
Whatever the commercial was for, I think your natural unscripted stuff sells better.
Fantastic camera operator to take the time to explain all that to a lift operator. Standup guy. (with 965k subs and a cheerful demeanor but you get my point)
advertisers, so annoying and useless. harmful to society. full of lies. so many people to make a fake scene.  one woman was paid to ruffle up a blanket.
The polythene sheet covering the big light was actually burning. A lot of smoke was coming out from the light.
Look like a porno to be honest 😂😂😂
Thanks for sharing, I hope you get more opportunities like this
Andrew's already a super star,, gonna hit a million this month,, & without selling someone stuff.. Think he had 63,000 subs when I found him. Waiting for a diesel 4x4 Andrew built truck,, no plastic crap!!
The title ....hahaha
Cody is not a union member, so only union dogs could be in this commercial...😜😉😂👍
Out to the movies, great! :-D
This makes me miss my days of producing TV commercials and working with film crews.
I don't think they realize that more people are going to see this through the crane operators video than what ever TV show they put it on.
I really need to start reading the description.. I'm picturing some guy wanting the brightest spotlight possible for the zombie apocalypse..
“Commercial”  I know porn when I see it.
965K subscribers 8/2/2021  Getting close to 1M!
Alot of special effects for a porn film,cool!
👌
A handy number! (Irish speak for an easy job)
Little does the producer know, more people will see this YouTube video instead of his commercial. Doesn’t realize he’s in the presence of a legend lol
That HGV with the generator on it has an European style lift gate....
One of these days we're going to see him in a space suit.
Fantasticos Video Camarata! Esa maquina se fabrica en argentina! muy serca de mi casa! Miro todos los videos! Saludos!  HIDRO GRUBERT
A heavy job you made light of?
Hi Andrew from Turkey, if you've been inside, can you draw a rough plan of this house?
That fixture is smoking hot…..
2 videos in 2 days??? YESS
Who do you know in the area with a lift tractor.  I know a guy.
I see Andrew Camarata I click
Is that big light smoking at the 3min mark?
Everything seen on the TV is a bunch of manipulated lies. Film production and the movie industry are all just glorified charlatans, and the sheep follow whatever the TV says...
woow it started lol ....feel good huh andrew when everything operate like it should without a glish...p.s i though you got rid of that machine ..heheheh only seen it once when you bought it first time .
Yessss....you are the sun!!
👍👍
Nothing is better than Andrew in the morning
A commercial. ..nice Andrew that should be easy money
I think 2 weeks and he will have his golem button from you tube, much deserved, spread the word to your friends to subscribe.
Interesting, thanks.
Next we will see Andrew in the movies. He will be a movie star.
How the hell did you get this job?!? I love it.
Imagine if the commercial is actually of Andrew lifting up the lighting. ☺
When Andrew makes an eight minute video it feels like one minute. When I make a one minute video if feels more like eight. I'm surprised he doesn't have his own tv show yet..
no plasma cutter needed?
this dude does everything
I am mildly disappointed, that the video didn't turn into a "modifying an 18k light" project.
It is amazing how complicated a production set can become. I was thinking they were shooting a porn movie starring Andrew "The Italian Stallion"  Camarata.
It seemed like a bad idea to cover a light that big with a plastic tarp.  Those lights get HOT.  And then, sure enough, you could see it smoking in the drone shots.
So now you can NOT only rebuild anything with wheels, but it seems you can make SUNLIGHT..... OMG
Ah now you have entered my world . Normally they would have strapped that arri light to the bucket of a cherry picker but your rig is so much more practical . I work in drama , not in commercials. Same gear but normally they don’t need any sound which is my department. The budget for commercials is huge as they spend hours getting the product to look amazing . They will work right through the night as normally there are too many cooks .....producers, lots of people from the product’s company all wanting their two penneth and money is not an issue , so the crew just keep going until they all agree . They smile all the way to the bank .😉
Easy job
Hey Andrew, how does one even get/find a job to do this? Seems so random. Did they know of you beforehand or did you see a listing?
Ad for bed linen? A likely story!!
Link us that commercial once they release it.
Is Andrew starting to post more often - or is it a filament of my illumination? 😂
That is such a nice home.
Boy Andrew all cleaned up! You and your equipment looked spiffy and no "surprises", hope you enjoyed the day...Please post the commercial when it comes out.
What a neat generator 3-phase 1800 RPM diesel __KW looked up "Inteli Vision" looks like a Czechoslovakian company that makes displays. Still curious about the generator probably cost more than a house.
Awesome! 👍👍
That's one expensive light!! Very cool video Andrew!
Well that was a cool gig for your little track lifter.  Thanks for sharing the experience.
That lift is so cool,  was it HGTV I wonder doing that commercial
That's great , Good job
I used to work in the industry!  I don't think this is an official Cine-sun but us non-grips/sparks used to call anything that big a Cine-sun.  Memories.
"commercial"...uh huh.  We know you've broken into the porn production business.
Some sort of photo or video shoot?
Let's see who will get more views. The commercial or Andrew helping to make the commercial... :-)
Andrew goes Hollywood.  Move over Ernest!
Making a movie about making a movie 😂10/10.
You had me worried a video with no K9 inspectors but you got them in at the end. Not cody but close enough. You always put up a good video alway interesting
I wonder how many of those people realised they're in the presence of greatness.
Andrew's in the movie business. You've  hit the big time! Hollywood awaits!
I don’t know why but I want that lift in a bad way lol
Andrew goes to Hollywood! Its was destined to happen lol
Is it weird that it takes 2 dozen people to make a 30 second blanket commercial but Andrew can build a Castle all by himself...and film the whole thing?
you can see a bit of smoke from the light on the basket, plastic melting or something?
How long until we see you rigging up a couple of those lights to the castle?
Andrew’s gone Hollywood on us, just kidding. Very cool Andrew, something new and different.
Easy money hey Andrew.
Looks like the light was smoking... I guess it didn't like the plastic on top
I want that Tank crane thing to trim my palm trees 🌴 around my pool
What don't you get involved with anyway?
Something a little different to watch …..well done 👏🏻👏🏻
Would love to hear how you got this job. Did someone know that you had the suitable machine?
Drop it bud
Very cool and a fun experience for you to watch the filming. Now that you have done one gig they will be calling on you again, you can count on that. Those dogs are cool, do you know what breed they are?
I thought they were setting up a different kind of shoot.
I wonder if more people will see the commercial or this video.
Movie time
When you see a new video for this absolute unit and then it’s says 15 mins and you cry a little inside that it’s not a feature length 😥
That’s a beautiful home. Amazing what money can buy.
That would be a $15,000, light plus probably another $500,000 lighting truck with generator. Someone has some deep pockets for that photo shoot. It's all about clean stabilized power.  Nice gig for the day Andrew.
content getting a little weak andy
Camarata Film Production!
I rented a big genny like that for a mig welding job on a trailer and it only had 30 hours on it, it amazed me how much power they have, 44kw and it didn't even flinch when I was pumping out 350 amps into a trailer hitch. The technology on them nowadays is amazing with touch screen start and so many metrics to flick through.
Wow...nothing broke, nothing silly or goofy happened....just a normal make sense video...so odd...but I like it!
That track machine is some nice machine.Light footprint and versatile.It would be nice to see a walk around up close on it in detail.
I'm watching you in Ukraine
First I thought they were taking photo's of the house. Then when he went in I was like damn is this a porn shoot? 🤣🤣
Wonder if they told him he was transporting a $24,000 light.
i bet Andrews video get more Views than the commercial :)
Woahhh!!!!!
I hope you was part of the advert!
Please enable subtitles (automatic subtitles)!  I do not understand everything and use automatic subtitles and their automatic translation.  Thanks
Making magic … welcome to the film industry Andrew
humans are silly
I bet that light was cheap. Good thing you didn't crash it into something :)
What a cool and bizarre gig! How the heck did Andrew find this job?!
Always time for the dogs!
Where Andrew is, there is dogs ☺️👌
легкий калым для Андрюхи)))
That was interesting. You never think about what all goes into a seemingly simple commercial.
What did he say that light cost? 8 grand?
awesome video Andrew!.
I always waiting Andrew video
How did you get that job Andrew.
Great job, something a little different. My favorite part was playing fetch at the end!
What a fantastic house, a dream to live in a space like this.
Was that light smoking?
how did you get that job ?
Give me the biggest light you have please….😂😂
Nice video AC
Gday from the Riverland South Australia 🇦🇺👍
You get some interesting jobs @Andrew Camarata
Surely a million subscribers before the end of august!!
Never a dull moment.
Andrew never fails to film dogs, no matter what job he is on
Do you own that machine??
You certainly put that whole scene in a different light, Andrew!
very cool you have great equipment  great videos you put out
How much did he say that light costs?
Andrew and his toys. Great
So now Andrew is in the movie business as a gaffer...................is there anything he cant do..............
Would make better commercial to just film andrew.
Where is the big boss Cody
You have link for the commercial?
What an awesome job opportunity
Cheers
You don't seem to care that you are about to hit a million subscribers.... that's why you will eclipse a million and keep going. Good for you!
Lightsta, Camarata, Actionta!
"don't get starstruck"
What commercial?
Love your vids cep it up
I'm glad Andrew's been putting up more content. He's one of the most uncomplicated, hard working young men on YouTube. Oh yeah, and having a wry sense of humor helps too!
Hey Andrew, will u convert ur army truck to a dump truck? I saw someone on YouTube have done it with the same army truck

This looks like fun
