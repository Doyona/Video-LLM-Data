Wow
Dean just stands there watching a scuffed rolling shot go past him kinda like me in goals on sunday football
After that pen save, I was saying here we go let’s Watford them, Toffolo with the cross DEENEY!!! But Neco Williams shot was just wide :(
I didn’t expect this from Tottenham I thought thy were better with conte but hopefully it can be fixed mid season COYS!
That's not a handball for me. Kane was leaning heavily on his other shoulder which whipped his opposite arm up so therefore a foul against Spurs
The commentary is absolutely ridiculous why does everybody hate spurs I don’t get it?
Henderson > De Gea
That penalty... the keeper was off his line when the ball was struck 🧐
Son will start firing once the gloves come on
1:42
Horrible referring today Kane offside  For 2nd goal, we played decent just couldn't finish
3:05 when FIFA decides it's time for your opponent to score
Just look at kouyate move (out) away from  Kane leaving him free to score
Thé goal keeper of NF is like Tom on Captain Tsubasa
Up the spurs.. COYS TTID
Our defense was snoozing why the  hell are we giving a side like Tottenham that much space !!
Gerrard for Bournemouth
Spurs recently haven’t really had a very convincing game
Spurs are my favourite team but have to feel sorry for Forest here , they deserved this game more than Spurs. I'm not seeing much improvement in the Spurs side even if they are scraping wins. Sloppy passing . too slow and seem to be virtually clueless going forward. Son seems to be out of sorts lately , not his usual sparkling self. Ah well , lets see if they can find some pace and pick things up a bit , they were down right boring during this match , not impressed at all.
Surely if Kane stay fits spurs will lift the title
17 shots for forest one on target..... you'd have better off with Stevie Wonder up front.
FOREST DESERVES THE WIN . GOOD GAME.👍
Penalty was saved not missed. But he was lethal on day
Forest played great, just didn't have the finishing - otherwise they were the better team
Ngl I think Henderson  stood over the line when the penalty  was shot
Amazing save from Henderson on that first goal. Making up by saving the penalty is the least he could do.
All that money spent and they are still crap
Harry Kane is a sensational striker, what a player. Come on you Spurs 👍🏿
Top defending from #21 there. Just walk away from Harry Kane and leave him completely unmarked. Whoever that is, pack yer bags son!
Tottenham Hot Spuds looking tasty this season…
Forest fans signing 'champions of Europe, you'll never sing that' 🤣🤣 just shows what a tiny, insignificant club Spurs are when it comes to silverware.
absolutely disgusted with these highlights, they do not reflect the game. it was a very even game and I can't believe they only showed one of our chances
Forest apparently don't rate Kane. Gave him all the space he wanted!
Notts Forest were awful. Going down I think
Harry Kane should of gone for 2 bookings 🤷‍♂️
U thought we played very well poor defense but for a newly promoted side putting up a fight to a top 4 teams is impressive
Son is selfish week in week out I just don't get it I love the player but square it to Kane ffs
How terrible is Martin Tyler? Just gets his little jibes in ...retire already.
How come Forest have no sponsor's  on their shirts
why is he wearing  a hat
How does Steve cook play in the premier Leauge 💀he’s the worst cb I’ve ever seen I’m not messing should be playing Leauge 2
Kane 1-0  0:14 Kane 2-0  2:54
I don't think I've ever seen Harry Kane strike a penalty which isn't bottom left, Henderson obviously knows he always goes there and saved it
Tottenham look average
How that is not a red card I’ll never know!!!😂 so glad we won because if forest got a draw after that I would of been fuming! Most blatant deliberate handball ever, officials in England are the worst in Europe
Looks to me like Spurs were lucky to take all 3 points.
Hendo and Gibbs white wasted at forest
I loved Richarlson doing kick ups on the field 🤣🤣🤣
Kane honestly doesn’t get enough respect his one of best to ever play in the league with probably the worst teams around him. If this man played in a good team from the beginning he’d be breaking every record. ( Villa Fan )
Dean Henderson should go on a permanent deal at forest. Hee unbelievable
I'm really not sure about these highlights, forest had way more chances but they decided to show ALL the spurs ones
Got the 3 points but not happy with the performance. With all due respect to Nottingham Forest, we’ve got the better players and a lot of their team is new and still trying to gel. We should be going there and taking control of the game, getting on the ball and applying the pressure instead of sitting off them. Kind of defeats the object of having wing-backs if we’re just attacking with the front 3.
Kane on his own 6 yards out for the second goal. Where are any of the defenders? 🙈
Terrible defending by Forest and not much better from the GK either!
Forest ate crap I hate them
Spurs and Arsenal fighting for the title. United and Liverpool getting relegated. What's happening?
We need to play surridge he is the only one who knows where the back of the net is , why does Cooper keep him on the bench ?????
Harry kane is back to his best apart from the penalty miss
2/10 from Spurs fans. Crap support.
Feel.sorry for forest. They were the better team. Spurs were really poor. Only created a couple of chances in the whole game, but they had the composure to take the chances which forest didn't do. If forest can start taking chances, they could have a very good season.
Jesus that assist was mad.
Bit bizarre for the penalty incident but really good save from Dean Henderson to deny Harry Kane
GUTTED BACKED KANE AT 20-1 TO SCORE A HAT TRICK!!!
how did Steve Cook make it back up to the prem lol
Shocking again from sky. Forest all over spurs the whole game. 2 chances and that’s the highlights.  Shocking sky
Richarlison got hit hard after juggling on Nottingham Forest 😅 but why is that not on the highlights?
Steve Cook could've given me an extra 3 points with persic nah but he's thinking he's super mans dog in dc league of super pets
The state of this comment section, a bunch of fifa and Sunday league players at best critiquing a guy with 187 Premier League goals. Joint 3rd in history.  You don't see professional footballers coming to your lots work place and handing out pointers on how to stack shelves, or the quickest way to count change. Yet somehow you've got a bunch of donuts, who's footballing knowledge barely extends pass their joy pads trying to call players (World class players at that) out for a mishap.  Don't pass out your footballing technical expertise on a YouTube comments thread. If you're qualified to give out tips and pointers, I suspect we'll be able to watch you on one of the sky sports Premier league highlight videos.
Perisic is mint man.
Tot-in-heim Vs Not-in-heim forest 👍🏽
Another season where I’m thinking why has no big teams still come for Kane and son aswell it’s crazy I’d love any of them at Liverpool
Forest are deffo going down
Carragher are you ok there pal did you realise richarlison put that ball i.n??
Rich Atkinson is a rat. I’m not even a Forest fan and actually kinda like spurs but the boy is a grade A helmet.
One of the top 10 worst performances i have ever seen Forest play. The passing of the ball was shocking and the defence was terrible. Richarlisons play acting should have got him sent off. We miss Spence and Garner , God help us on Wednesday night.
Coys
Why..........we won
They only showed one goal?
The city ground can create an awesome atmosphere, that hurt my ears
Good to see the top 6 all won this weekend, the way it should be!!
Man puts on a hat and turns in to prime pie face
The fact that the goalkeepers cap  didnt come of after that save was class YNWA
‘Gone up inside him’ sounds painful
Lol saved a penalty and everyone’s talking about United. Did you see the first goal 😂😂😂👀👀👀 daisy cutter
Steve Cook should have broken bones he got away with murder today ,,,Arsenal are the Great the moment though
I keep seeing comments like "Spurs not at their best" - maybe they ate just playing at their level and commentators are overestimating them
Nottingham forests home kit looks like a nice Nike t shirt it doesn’t look like a football shirt it’s just a normal shirt 👕
Football is the best I love football
Aussie kid :)
Kane need to force a move to Manchester United if he want trophies
Kane doesn't usually mis penalties but he put in a place he likes a lot and Deano read it.
I’ve said it a million times before and I’ll keep saying it, dean Henderson is the best keeper In the league, anyone else in goal and forest concede atleast 5
I’m amazed that a striker like Kane is allowed to be there in the box unmarked for all that time ?!!!
Let's just leave Kane in the box completely unmarked. Fantastic plan that is from forest defenders.
Forest were excellent in this game and have proven to be a great addition to the Premier League. With better finishing, they could easily challenge for top half. From a Leeds fan.
Spurs look very very good. Solid all round squad. Conte has them pumping. Needed that full first pre season.
You'd think Forest would have learned their lesson from the last time they were in the Premier League. Ended up skint selling the likes of Van Hooijdonk etc. History will repeat.
Nobody talking about Kulu assist for the first goal! Reverse pass to perfection for kane to collect, if that’s de bryune it’s blowing up all over the enternet!
Kanes the only player that can score a tap in from 18yards
Well done, Spurs. Quality when it mattered. 👍  Disappointed, but can't complain with the result. I think Forest are good value this year and should stay up, but they're still making a few silly mistakes which will cost them against top teams like this. The defending for the second goal was awful. They just totally switched off.  More positives than negatives. Loving the atmosphere for one, and Worrall had his best game so far. On we go.
Richardson's cross was a thing of beauty  For the first time Sonny's place is under threat as soon as Richarlison came on he was a nuisance
Harry should have had a goal disallowed at Chelsea Romero and the wig tug its swings and roundabouts in football
Very happy with that, Lingard, Henderson & Forest all lose, happy sunday
Since when is deliberately tipping it over the bar not a straight red? Must have just been added to the handball exemptions
Steve cook did the same thing for Bournemouth against Norwich in prem 3 seasons ago, was sent off that day and should of been again today.
England no1 striker, and that second goal, not a single forest defender anywhere near him...manager must be going nuts at his defenders
3hr gamg
On a better day Spurs would have scored five,at least.
I'll never understand why they say they "missed" a penalty if it's clearly goal-bound but saved. You wouldn't say a player missed a shot on target if it's saved, maybe they "missed a chance". But they didn't miss the shot. Just taking away from a brilliant save.
How on earth did Harry Kane have that much room inside the box for the second goal? That's just laughably stupid defending.
The pathetic performance of Nottingham Forest today was a warning that it'll be returning to Championship football next season. The defending was completely diabolical. I ask:  where's Grabban? Without him this team is doomed! The current players are no better than my local park team!
Did forest lose because they've signed to many players will be the next debate coming up on talksport! Despite them needing to sign players cos half ther team left from last season just wait!
Kane telegraphed where he was going to put that penalty.  It was still a great save though because he leathered it, and then some.
Starting to think we should of let west ham take lingard . I've not seen anything from in him in 3 games to justify what he is getting paid . Also more proof we need a decent striker
Some shocking defending
People need to start giving goalkeepers a lot more credit. Kane didn't miss, Henderson pulled off a brilliant save. If not it would have been a great penalty
Correct decision to give a penalty. No it’s not a red as it didn’t deny a clear goal scoring opportunity. Yellow all day
Son much better game, but has too many selfish moments due to his fear of his current inconsistency. Need him back to his best asap. Also bissouma needs to start, he broke up play way better than hojberg and bentancur when he came on
2 goals and the highlights are longer than Liverpool’s 9-0 win. Explain that one..
A result for spurs hope it keeps going COYS
Well done Spurs.
Dean Henderson is great keeper can't wait when he actually plays for man utd tbh. Only Lukas has a better penalty stops than him in my opinion in the prem this season
Red card handball
2:48 this is someone isn’t confident in crossing wow
Son needs the bench
Great performance from both sides forest controlling the game really well spurs devastating in attack and solid off the ball
Dean Henderson's hat gives him superpowers. You heard it here first.
Leaving kane of all people in that much space for the 2nd goal is mind-blowing. Surely the defence were told not to give him an inch of space. Let alone 8 or 9 yards
Man my team lost
I'm liking the retro, no-sponsor look that Forest have - I kind of hope they've been selling more shirts this year as a result
Carra getting excited a bit too early after the penalty save then Kane soon silenced the whining scouser once again...
How many more players Forest signing ?!?!
How is Lingard doing? PMSL
forest fan here - that second goal...we need shooting for that. All of us.
Where are all the spurs fans and media who turned on kane who said he's finished ?
Notts Forest are wnak
Biased highlights. Forest were tearing Tottenham apart, result was the only thing against us.
Forest defense just having a kip on that 2nd goal
Good penalty save
Why is a penalty being saved always reported as a miss by the media?
Why is this wannabe yashin wearing a hat
Spurs ain't challenging for the title. Too one dimensional.
Richarlison’s showboating 💀
I love the cap on dean henderson
Forest played very well considering all the new players well done lads
Good game
Richarlison stop that
How it only ended 2-0 spurs should of scored 5 or 6 easy.
Fear for Forest, 17 signings, paying big wages and just one lucky scruffy win to show for it.
That handball was a clear red if I've ever seen one, how he wasn't sent off only God knows
Can’t believe Forrest payed £42mill on the English Eric Djemba-djemba
harry kane hes done it again nice 3 points for spurs coys
Kane failed to score a hat-trick this weekend but do you know who didn't fail? Haaland scored a hat-trick. So is Haaland now better than Kane? 🤔
Kane 🙏
Don't worry if we leave one of the world's best strikers totally unmarked 6 yards out. I mean what could possibly go wrong?
Forest defending fr 2nd Kane goal was worst I've ever seen! 4 forest players in box with only Kane near goal and not one with two yards of him!! It's a travesty to call it Schoolboy defending, even Schoolboys mark better than that! 😳🤣🤣🙏
Harry Kane top player seriously goal scorer just no trophy's to show when he gives up his boots which be very dispointed career with no trophy's to look Back on
Spurs fan here we've been dreadful the first 4 matches but winning playing poor, we'll see how far we come when we play the big boys starting on Wednesday with a tough away game at West ham
Great penalty save BUT what was the Forest defender doing - the backstroke?? 🏊‍♀️
that first goal for kane has to be one of  the worst goals ive ever seen
Forrest played Spurs off the park but had no cutting edge in the final third. Spurs defended well too and they have Harry Kane. The difference maker.
Park the bus football at it's best
Lucky spurs as always
How can it be a highlights package without the best highlight of the game?  Brennan Johnson legging up Richarlison is one of the highlights of the season, let alone in this match!
So many people still just finding reasons to hate on spurs when they’ve literally done nothing wrong another great result and what a ball by richarlison for kanes second goal 🥵
What an atmosphere!
Thought the second offside
Arsenal fan but I just can't not love Kane
Commentator, just give the keeper his due for saving the penalty. Stop with the cliches and with sucking up to the "favourites".
As a spurs fan I've been a forest admirer since Clough and Taylors days so even though I admired this team there where an lot of yellow cards which if they keep playing like this will turn into reds, massive amount of incidents should have been yellows they got away with including the deliberate back heel into Richarlisons nuts and the finger pushing into, I think Højbjerg eyes, the deliberate double handed shove into Kanes waist in front of goal, another red card, So all in all Forest benefitted from the new push to keep games flowing
useing hand to move ball away  probably was best option as he couldn't header that ball and kane would have placed it near right side away from keeper
Harry kane is the best penalty taker in the league so Dean Henderson should be proud saving his penalty. I hope he gets a world cuo spot.
Well you don’t see kane miss a penalty that often 😅 but it happens to the best of us, 21 in a row for spurs he was bound to miss at some point. Two goals to make up for it tho 🙌 Richy was brilliant when he came on, great assist
Forest were brilliant and came out fighting from the start, hats off to them, they never gave up. I really hope they stay up from a tottenham fan ❤️
Notice how Henderson only does well for clubs that get relegated.. just like how de gea only 'does well' during a trophyless/underwhelming season. Need a new gk ASAP
Goal of the week.
Liverpool and City yes all the bottler talk is funny...but take Spurs seriously they haven’t even got going yet but they are winning games with ominous certainty. Conte is a very very capable coach
Well done Harry k💯💯🏆
Spurs were awful for most of the first half. Why would you set up that deep against a newly promoted team. Can understand it against City and Liverpool. It's not as if we defended well. Lacklustre, laboured, slow, not closing down and no intensity. 2nd half much better once Richarlson came on (again) but if Forest had equalised it would have been deserved on the run of play. Play like this against the big boys and we'll get hammered. Where's the intensity? Looked like they were still in pre-season at times. The fact that we could have had a hatful of goals 2nd half just makes you wonder why we insist on playing the lazy way like we did 1st half, against these sorts of teams. Made Forest look better than they were by giving them confidence and letting them play up to our 18 yard box. 3 points though but we started with 3 lucky 1-0 wins and went top ladt season only to go on and lose the next 3 letting in 9 goals. I'd start Richarlson for the West Ham game and bring Son on later 2nd half. He's not right at the moment and Holberg needs to sort his passing out. Gives the ball aeay far too often.
Should of put the show boating in there 😂
calvert lewin be wondering why richarlison never did that for him
Just clocked that forest don't have a short sponsor
Forest getting better each game now. Just need to get the preseason done with
I’m sorry but son needs to be dropped next match. Richy needs starts. Son had been very poor.
Mate these highlights don’t reflect how the game went at all. Forest pretty much dominated for 90 mins and should’ve won the game 4/5-2. Had loads of chances played great football but just couldn’t finish.
God spurs suck just how sad it is to be the counter FC of the prem and there footy is boring as crap
What an assist by Ritchie
These small epl teams need to remember, you are up against players who have starred in World Cup and euro championship finals...they’re v professional but can go up 2 , 3 even 4 levels in focus and application for the really big prem and champ league games.....job done for spurs, onto the next one
Henderson didn't even move for Kane's first goal. Yet he wanted to claim that he is the Number one for United. LOL.
The highlights show spurs ONLY chances, they just took them. They offered so little to this match
Calm down re the red card. Of course it was a red. Forest fans suggesting that they played well are a little deluded. Spurs in 2nd gear made getting that 2nd goal hard work but it was always coming. A bit of huff and puff by forest but how many saves did Hugo have to make. I counted 1...and that was very routine
Arsenal are going to cook spurs at the emirates 😁
Steve cook is an excellent keeper
Forest need a finisher, were the better team just lacked the finish
Great marking from Forest at the end there
I went to that match! I saw myself at 1:58
criminal defending for that second goal
How Kane get MOTM yeah he goal hung two goals as usual but besides that he didn't play, like he does for England, that's why England and Spurs can't win trophies.
18 signings, just saying…
Kane free
close from Williams
he didnt miss the pen it was saved
Kane rolled it in
I think that off side trap needs some work 🥸
That defending by Kouyaté is a stackable offence
How Cook hasn’t been sent off I don’t know
I miss the days when games were competitive and entertaining. Those days are long gone sadly.
Steve cook doesn’t get sent of for that but last season James gets sent of for a handball where it bounced off his leg. We need a complete change in the officials!!
Forest played well and they can take lots of positives. Forest needs to score goals unfortunately they played too many passes outside the penalty box and it was too crowded.
We hate Tottenham
tough game forest played well but kane at again and richarlison what cross to kane hope they link up more hopefully sonny scores sooner rather later he will come l into his flow a good game
one of the best assists ive seen in a while , richarlison has crazy talent
Kane better hope that Spurs wins a trophy before long otherwise his entire career would be absolutely wasted.
Harry Kane team
Forrest were unlucky today, they played well  and should’ve probably got a draw, Tottenham players never seem to give 100% and I don’t blame them but at some point there luck will run out and Conte will be exposed! In due time everybody 😅
Kane or haarland 👀
Harry Kane world class 🔥
Forest poor created nothing out of a lot of possession going down I think
Almost at 4 mil subs
Not bad for the championship...
Correct me if I’m wrong but didn’t Dean Henderson come off his line to save the penalty? I thought this wasn’t allowed?
That outside of the boot pass by Richarlison, what a corker.
Well....That was the Spurs highlights,now what about the Forest part of the match. Oh wait a minute,a London Club aren't We.
Spurs performance was poor. You play like that in the champions league and you will be crucified . The that’s 3 games out of 4 that we have not played good but won. At some point your luck will run our .
Terrible defending by Forest
Football is a results based business but it won’t be long till the opposition Spurs play against also start playing deep.
e
The delivery from richarlison 🔥🔥🔥 Not talked about enough
For people saying cook shoulve been sent off, you cant give a red and a penalty from one piece of foul play.
I feel spurs haven’t really got out of 2nd gear yet this season… Son well below average so far… bodes well I guess…
It's gonna be a good golden boot race out of haaland kane and salah
Kane is getting very predictable with penalties. He needs to send it both sides of the goal.
Made him my triple captain today! I'm annoyed he didn't score the penalty 😒
Very rare Kane misses pens
Poor guy. Will never win anything at spurs.
Straight back down for little forest had a good couple of years did forest that's all small club rubbish fan base
Henderson has to be England no 1
Time for Son to hold bench.
I thought forest played really well given the circumstances. Our defence wasn’t the strongest but one of the positives to take away is that our attackers are forming a good alliance. Onto city. You reds 🌳 🔴
How did kane miss the penalty, surely (sarcastically) Henderson saved  that, give him the credit.
Richarlison's ball with the outside of the boot for Kane was class. Some people I spoke to doubted Perisic when they got him, but he played that role for Conte perfectly at Inter and he's still got it 👌
Ye Obviously 🤪
Kane was absolute garbage all game
Wait you can wear a cap as a GK? That's mad
feel robbed as a forest fan we should’ve atleast got a draw or even a win
What happened to Sonny
Penalty - goalkeeper jumps around so why not retaken
And that's why you pay 60 mil
Give the keeper credit for a penalty SAVE. Don't call it a miss
I had my doubts about Richarlison but wen he came on he made a difference
Forest keeper FAR too confident.....shouldn't of believed his own hype 🤣🤣🤣
Korea  over my son noodling on noodles of money
Everyone talking about Arsenal this, Arsenal that whey spurs are unbeaten and have only conceded 3 goals.. I’m sorry but that’s an excellent start, conte is doing magic with this team.
Still annoys me olé didn’t bring Henderson on for them pens in that europa final. He’s good at saving them
I just noticed the goalkeeper is wearing a cap😭😭😭😭😭
Forest will go down for sure.  They've got nothing upfront and won't score enough goals
Spurs' two goals perfectly illustrate how rigged professional football is. Dean Henderson just stood and watched Kane's shot go in for the first one. And then the Forest centre-half just randomly walked away and left Kane unmarked for the second.
Kane missing a penalty. Rare things to see
Kane didn't even play well and scored twice. That's how good he is at his job.
Kane didn't miss a penalty. The goalkeeper made a very good save
Cook is a class acrobatic keeper
Whilst Steve cook should have been off (from a forest fan) we looked INCREDIBLE all game.
Spurs haven't even got out of 2nd gear yet. Looking good.
What a penalty save. Best I've seen in a while.
Henderson playing like Lev Yashin   If you know you know
Massive shout to Dean Henderson, Did he’s absolute all to stop spurs from scoring. Unfortunately he had clowns helping him defend today
that ginger guy is good he played football as it is not worried about who scored kane and other front line the is problem of not wanting to pass the ball to each other
fantasy popping off
Lol nottingm forest got lots of players but still lost
Nottingham forest where shockiny poor. What did Brighton do that was so right ?
Really surprised kane missed a penalty. He is the penalty king!
Frustrating to lose that as Spurs weren’t that good and their goals were down to bad defending from us. But, a world class striker in the Prem like Kane will take full advantage of the mistakes. Still, had some good moments ourselves and it’s something we can take confidence from.
I have a lot of respect for forest. I think you've got a real gem in gibbs-white he was superb. Johnson is a decent player to.  We were just more clinical, looking forward to another great game in the cup 🙌
Guardiola annoyed Spurs fans when he called them "The Harry Kane team" but, he wasn't wrong, was he?
Decent performance from Forest considering they are a team of strangers. Bodes well when they fully gel, they will be an attractive watch.
Amazing performance by Dean Henderson easily best player on the pitch for forest past 2 games. Mired by a terrible defence and a lack lustre offence. Yes 2 goals went in but he’s doing double saves only for his defenders to be staring and not clearing the ball
Still love you, Richy.
Son was too greedy.
Forest fans were brilliant as a spurs fan 👏🏼
Why Forrest got no sponsor on their shirts ??
I find it disgraceful that Steve Cook wasn't sent off for deliberately denying a goal scoring opportunity. That clearly deserved a red card. If Forest had grabbed a result from this game, it would've been extremely controversial.
Spurs were outplayed for most of the game, Conte is overrated.
FOREST were excellent today. If they continue like that then they will be fine. A solid mid-table finish is achievable.  Spurs were lucky with both goals due to sloppy defending in Forests part.  Forest fans will be gutted to not have got a point from that match.
What is the point of this var......Last goal offside
Calling it now. Spurs win the tittle.
Kane is unreal. How sad that, much like Shearer, all his goals will add up to zero.
Richarlison absolutely rattled johnson 🤣🤣
Forest will be up there this season maybe not top 6 but definitely mid table
Richarlison has to start ahead of Son for the game against West Ham
Forrest just kept buying and buying but the players are of little quality. Even in good positions there was never really any threat. Will probably go down and be in a financial mess
Richardson showboating was quality his a quality player wen his got decent players around him
Conte football is so boring zzzz I'm not a spurs fan BTW I just was watching the game do spurs enjoy this football  also what has happened to son lately normally he scores for fun
Kane didn't miss the penalty, it was on target. Give Henderson the keeper credit for saving it.
Kane just seems to always score,whether it be a pen or a tap in he always scores
Kane is top 3 striker with benzema and lewa top class 👏
How did Kane miss a penalty? Dean Henderson could really help England in a penalty shootout
Tottenham deserved the win to be fair. I don’t think forest played that badly and I think they could stay up this season. The difference in class was clear in this match though.
Spurs playing counter attack against a newly promoted team
Richarlison’s assist for Kane 🔥
Perhaps we can have a match that only consists of the many replays we have to watch, while the game goes on!
Next season we'll be drowning in debt and playing Derby in the Championship
Reality for Forest City next.
What a pass from Richarlison!
Pigeons the goat🐦😜
Spurs are so dull, but credit to them for taking their chances. Richarlison wants shooting, though. They've no chance of top 4 on this evidence, forest will be fine, though
360p quality video in 2022. Only sky
Tottenham look very poor so far this season but a win is a win
Solid from spurs but all credit to forest they played some great football
Even If Harry Kane would have scored a penalty, he would buy drinks for everyone Honestly!     Sorry people, Im Man United Fan
Can anyone explain why that's not a red? It's so blatant.
why is the limit 360p for me.
Richarlison doing keepy ups tho 😭
Y was hendo wereing a hat
Steve Cook should’ve been a world class goalkeeper tbh I still remember his save when Norwich played Bournemouth that’s absolute scenes for you right there
Expected defeat. Glad was only 2-0
Henderson needed this loan move he needs to leave Manchester United to become number 1 somewhere else
Hat on the keeper reminds me of yashin lol. Keeper made a few good saves too
Even though im a Tottenham fan Kane ain't breaking Shearers record it's just too far and Kane Is approaching his 30's but you never know
Alan shearer, he's coming for you
I WILL HAPPILY TAKE A 2_0 WIN AT THE CITY GROUND IN NOTTINGHAM AT NOTTINGHAM FOREST WE DESERVED THE WIN COYS LET'S BEAT WESTHAM ON WEDNESDAY
The movement from kouyate for the second goal was world class
360p yanno
Pulsating game. Forest don't half love a foul
Spurs been playing bang average recently they will get found out soon
Henderson looking absolute quality for that 1st goal hahahahaa
Kane scores twice *laughs in FPL*......and misses penalty "FUUUUUU"
As a Bournemouth fan I love that Forest r back in the prem
Is a penalty saved called a miss now? Penalty was on target but keeper saved it.
Nottingham Forest deserve respect for their crucial signings I can’t imagine them going down any time soon.
Kane he's a great one 🦁
What a joke not to give the red for the handball
People will criticise Spurs for this approach but Forest never really looked like scoring today & Spurs have one of the best counterattacks in Europe so why not take advantage of it? They always looked in control tbh & still haven't clicked yet this season. Dangerous.
Genuinely spurs could challenge for the title they’ve been so good so far and look incredible.
Harry Kane vs haaland it seems
good win today. We move on and get more wins. Richardlison looked more positive then son need to play him next 💪💪 coys
Still a bigger club than bayern and livarpool
Wow it’s a game we’re Harry Kane hasn’t scored a penalty😂😂
Imagine if harry kane and Maguire had a baby tha would be one messed up baby
Greatest fpl week of my life,i had Haaland,Kane and firmino,just beautiful
Rollercoaster of emotions to have him in your fantasy team
As a Spurs fan Im happy for Richarlson to get a assist but how can he be fine with being on the bench for 80% of the match

First no cap bruv
Golden boy can't be sent off, should have had a second yellow. English privelege
Finishing fourth won’t get you a trophy and I don’t think they’ll get fourth this season
Fpl points ahhhhhhh…
A great save from the pen
Came out 3 seconds after the game finished and what an assist by richarlsion
