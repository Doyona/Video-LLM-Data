ASHLANDS VIDEO WILL COME AS SOON AS ITS READY 🙏  Though I should say our progress has grinded to a halt as people were either put off by the Ashlands or went to other games.
The next update was super janky
Tiiiime for Ashlands :D
im just watching the add opening and i already wana play, well done<3 lmao 4:20 "Fnut son of Snut"  naaaa i cant handle it, its to much
16:45 “JESUS!!”
Just killed moder and now Im trying to settle in the plains but I'm getting my butt kicked by all enemies. Love this game.
Fnut needs to return for the ashlands!
Gta 6 before ashlands vid... Hytale before ashlands vid... Deep north before ashlands vid... Silk song before ashlands vid... Enter the gungeon 2 before ashlands vid... Mr beast makes good content before ashlands vid... Everyone refers to twitter as X instead of twitter before ashlands vid... I get good at minecraft pvp before ashlands vid...
10:51 such a filipino thing to say lol😂
wish more youtuber had "puppy breaks" instead of adds
(2 years too late but still) FOR KARL
The bit with the tar slimes gave me flashbacks. Fuck those things, I can't fucking deal with them.
@0:01 convinced
Ashlands!!!
Okay, finally bought Valheim and played till the dark forest, now I just need to find some goofy ass friends.
play project zomboid
5:01 the definitive moment Zanny the 3rd was crowned 😂
The npc fps is halirious 😂😂😂
give me ashlands zanny, and my life is yours!
11:15 Just a tip for anyone who needs it, these bugs are resistant to some of the base damage types (Blunt, Pierce, Slash), immune to others, and the only thing they take full damage from is elemental and poison damage.  So when you get to the mistlands for the first time, the poison bow (Draugr Fang) and frost hammer (Frostner) that can be made as soon as you can get silver from the mountains, are your best friends until you get enough of the mistland materials to make magic staves and other things like that. (Silver weapons from the mountains aren’t enough, because seekers are immune to the “Spirit” damage that silver weapons do. Frostner does Spirit, Blunt, AND Frost damage.)
Hearing some Children talking gibberish at the very beginning of the Video, is everything but an Argument to play this Game.  I played the Trial Version on Xbox and was wondering how the online Experience might be. Now I know. I'll pass
"i have an incoming transmission on my radio" "inco- the WHATT"?
No 👍
conivmce me to play but starts off stacked
still waiting for zanny to experience ashlands
Wish I had someone to play Valheim with.
“In Norse mythology you’re a bitch” 😭
7:01 That is true honestly, nothing against Minecraft but every individual component of this game is the best of any survival game I have played. Building, cooking, progression, its all so good in Valheim.
We are close to that 1.0 release!! Just came back here because I love this game and most of the people who play it. Except for that one son-of-a-draugr...they know who they are.
only ever got to play it alone
Fnut is bald in Tagalog lmao
Amazing game
this video in particular made me a lil lonely
Valheim? Really? A man of your talents?  (so glad I found this video)
Every time I watch you play another game, you have 1 more dog. How do I just happen to watch those in chronological order despite picking playlist at random
all the grey numbers from hitting enemies with the damage they're resistant to upset me so much
if zanny's name is john does that make him john youtube?
I'm a big fan of the guy who screams like he's in a Tom and Jerry cartoon
The most amazing game I've ever played. Best 250 hours I have ever spent.
zanny's name is jon? jon zanny?
Gaming, really? A man of your talents?
This guy’s pretty funny, he should play uncharted.
Is the name “The Rooooooooooook”  A GothamChess reference by chance?
3:01 odin literally watches you the entire way. And disappears if you get close. I wonder why.
anyone else's multi-player experience like this ,mine was.
ARE YOU SERIOUS!? NO YAGLUTH FIGHT!? THAT BOSS MUSIC IS THE BEST!!!
"Whats the light attack?"  "There is no light attack"
I love your video and make me buy valheim and force my friend to buy it to xD
Gaming, really? A man of your talents?
Bro this game is peak. My friend named Sotiris Fermopoulos told me to get it and because he wakes up really late because he's a dumbass I'm playing alone 😁 🔫
Ashlands when!??!!?
This is by far the most hilarious Valheim video I've ever seen! Reminded me of my first squad & our adventures 🙌
PLEEEEASE ZANNY I NEED THE ASHLANDS VIDEO!!
Valheim building mechanics is one of the best if not the best out there. There's almost no limit to what you can build if you're creative.
4:38 actually has me in tears every single time I watch this lmaoooo please Zan I need the ashlands video
i am convinced
I'm looking for a game that could give me a journey with people I meet in that game, so far my top pick is sea of thieves but valhiem could take it
watched this video about 30 times, waiting patiently for ashlands video. hurry up zanny i might have to watch it another 30 times
best thumbnail of 2024
we're gonna need an ashlands video now boss
Valheim is one of my favorite games
My guy is names Ekusjord
Ashlands when😭🙏
I was watching this while playing valhiem and all the background music of your game kept scaring the shit out of me
Minecraft < Valheim
"It's my job to guide these new players" *Says nothing as they try and dock their boat in the plains*
How do you get this weapon 0:42
4:41 that troll just emerges from the darkness😂
4:40 that scream actually killed me
Me who already plays valheim seeing the title: “Okay, convince me.”
12:43 - HAH
why does youre gf sound like bmo from advensure time
I’ve never had to grind so much in a game, but I’ve never had so much fun and felt so fulfilled by a game.
alright, i’m convinced. i’m getting valheim
I love this game. My pc broke and now I'm stuck to xbox cloud to play.
4:30 Did I hear a rock and stone ?
Jag älskar Valheim.
ashland when
The Radhan intro is way too good!
cant wait for ashlands vid
game is cool and all... but pups win my heart
Man I need a group of people to play Valheim like this haha
10:28 This entire moment especially when Zanny is just with his gf just hanging out in a game and just showcasing the base, especially since he added an iron cooker she wanted in the base. To me this is just wholesome.
dude you litterally cant play valheim with a friend that isnt your best friend for 5 years thats why valheims isnt know this much but this game is BOOONKERS
It is interesting that you mention Thor and Jesus in a single sentence
I think I've single-handedly watched all of Zanny's Valheim videos. Like more than 10x each
I need more
Your videos convinced me to buy the game a while back after  which i played till the mistlands and then kind of let it go, recently i have been able to convince my friends to get it and it’s the best gaming experience I’ve had in my life
if u have friends thatll play with you
i didnt know ive been watching zannys vids this whole time lol. i started to recognize him recently cause of kcd clips. i didn't realize ive watched his valheim and helldivers video before.
10:54 “and finally I did it, my girlfriend tolerates me” - zanny
Zanny has devolved into the valheim content loop
If only this was on PS5
You've wasted 17 minutes my boy...... I Already play this game
the scream of pure fear when that troll materialises out of thin air
This game is terribly optimized just like Gen Z
Chop chop zanny boy ashlands is out already
Love this game a fucking love slipknot 🫶🤘
I’m obsessed with this game at the moment 🫶🤘
Should i play
Me and my buddy rage quitted the game after we lost all of our stuff in the Mountains twice 😂😢 I want to play again but he gave up sadly.
12:40 (the future) DANG Y U JINKS IT
Hello, I would just like to say you did convince me to play again, and now me and my best friend have a world together, so thank you.
no ump no play
posting videos, really? a man of your talents?
Helldivers 2 looking kinda different
FNUT
I was gonna say Ashland but it seems yall know that
ASHLANDS VIDEO WILL COME AS SOON AS ITS READY 🙏  Though I should say our progress has grinded to a halt as people were either put off by the Ashlands or went to other games.
1 Year it take to come out and i frck love Ashland's.  DO 1 VIDEO YOU DEEP SH
when Ashlands video?
Zanny.. when's the Ashlands video coming out? XD
Huh, thats why they are so good. Both published by coffee stain. tbh I didn't realise that until I saw this video.
Ashlands is finally out
Day one of rewatching these 3 videos until Zanny posts a new Valheim video
this brings back so many good memories of my friend groups first time playing, sadly we do not game anymore
ZANNYYYYYYY TIME TO PLAY VALHEIM AGAIN
"Allow me to paint you a full picture." That's wehere you got my ass being nailed to my chair and got my undivided attention :)
Not convinced, sorry
@zanny !!! We need you in the shield wall in the ashlands! The enemy is vast, but we shall prevail!
I enjoy your edits
why do you keep dissing brazil bro you never even step a foot here lmao
thor's in the game?
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Zanny. Hey. Guess what. Hey. Zanny. Guess what. Valheim. Ashlands. Now. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Skal. Valholl. Etc.
I hope your cooking something up for Ashlands :D
The troll bruh💀
One of the funniest intros I've seen in a while, instant sub lmao
Tis' time for Ashlands brother!
play ashlandssss
me and my friends binge valheim for a month, make it to bonemass but never beat him and then we end up getting a fresh start and we restart the cycle
First time went from Black Forest to plains. Eventually realized why we couldn’t find something to do with the black metal.
Well it took one year...
Underrated game
You guys are so hilarious loool can't wait to see you play the Ashlands now that it's out Much love ♥
How can I watch this full series playthrough?
You should play Valheim again the new Ashlands update is out
I felt the 1st second immediately. "It's a peaceful life! I've been running to my corpse and dying for the last two ingame months!"
You skipped the mountains? Whats up with that
A very poorly optimized game for older rigs. I can't play it without my PC sounding like an airplane taking off. Baffling since it's far from graphically impressive.
im to broke to buy valheim..😔
me is already
ONE year later and  Ashlands are still not out.
I wish I had some Pals to play Palheim with. 😢😢
It seems that next April 2024 we will have The New Ashlands Zone♥ according to the creators, the difficulty will be beautifully rewarding like going from the meadows to the dark forest! I can't wait for a new video to come out with this new patch...
Valheim is a broken piece of shit unless you own an rtx
have u tried terraria?
its minecratf but souls style
Tried this before. Just felt really fake what with the landscape being AI generated.  Give me an Elden Ring every single time.
I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!
everybody warrior until... 4:41
i hate that game u farm for 20 hours just do die and lose everything
4:33 ROCK AND STONE
They call it "The Lands of Valheim", instead of the tenth world which is an actual part of Valheim lore. Where is it mentioned? In the opening scene...
the sad part is that this game has an ending
I like to imagine that this is the actual type of banter that real vikings had during their voyages
If valheim was on ps4 i would play it. Until then, I'll stick to ark SE
Lmao, hilarious! 🤣
The reason why Valheim isn't that popular is because most people don't have a computer that can play it well. A lot of people have no computer and only the previous generation console, i.e. ps4 or xbox one. And on elderly consoles you get an average of 20 frames per minute, and that is not steady by any means either.
Was convinced in the first minute 😂
Press F to Nut
LFG for valheim newbie pls, im kinda lost and cofused. Zanny do ur magic bro..
I feel like "in Norse mythology you're a b*tch" went underappreciated 🤣
The amount of love he put in his video
I lasted 53 seconds. "clicks on Valheim"
you should try "enshrouded"
Snut means cop in swedish😂
it seems you were playing this on xbox and i wanted to know if it is just as good as the pc version? I was also wondering if it had all the same content as pc too?
Having pies before having beaten bonemass, interesting
Love puppy breaks
Him: Look, an oven! Her: For what? Modern women be like...
For 20 seconds I thought it was assassins creed
10:20 zanny name reveal?
"Snut" IS actually a slang word in swedish. Means "cop" :D
First video I watched in 2024
if mission control from drg died would he go to valheim?
Wraiths are so rare.  they only come out every night in the swamps HAHAHA
Great video. The doggos were my favorite part :)
its working i tell ya
14:04 what is this song?
I'm watching this while playing Valheim, everyone should really check it out!
i dont know if i should get the game or not. dont have many friends who would actually buy this game lmao
I would love to see more Valheim stuff. This always sparks joy.
no need i already have 150h
I didnt even watch this for a full minute, you have convinced me to play again..
1:47
Valheim is the kind of Minecraft we should had have
Odur's theme from Thymesia always goes hard.
I had a lot of fun with this game, spent like 200+ hours on my first playthrough building my base.  Though that was back when it first came out.  Should dust it off again but only if i can get a mod working that gives me tailwind all the time on a ship.  I knows there is a mod for it, but many mods have not been updated in a long time.
That hydralisk is crazy
That was creasy. I like it. Nice wokr, you party is a realy cool. :D
FOREFATHERS, ONE AND ALL! BEAR WITNESS!!!!!!!!!!
We need more valheim seeing the boys running around screaming surviving craziness
I keep trying to get my friends to play this game but its too difficult and everyone gets off it before we all get together.. what can i do to prevent this? are there any friendly community servers that will accept players?
4:40 🤣🤣
As long as mistlands took to develop.... dude I don't even want to think about the wait for the next biome.
We need another valheim update from Zanny 🤣 ,y server just made it to the MistLands, scary as hell lmaooo
my friend got me into Valheim and i love it. we just got to mistlands and made some etir, now i got the lightning pokey stick AND a giant hammer. oh and i shoot fireballs now cause i have magic, this game is amazing. also i've taken to calling the flying spitting thing a Netch cause it reminds me of Netches from Morrowind lol.
I want friends to play with I don't got friends. I got the game im just missing people i can actually connect with and not feel so out of place.
Only 10 seconds in, and I thought it was a reupload
“A wraith! That’s like the rarest enemy!”  Rancid remains: “am I joke to you?”
Going into the mistlands with cooked deer meat is some of the most unhinged behaviour ive seen in years
Well, you have earned yourself another subscriber. 😂
anyone got a discord for this game?
Dude the friend vibes have me rolling!!!! Love it great job!!!!
The role playing was fucking on point. Who was that?
this is so much fun
mistlands got me screaming like a bitch
There is no light attack 😂
imma play this game soon cuz my laptop will arrive soon enough 3 months
it’s like a spiritual successor to Minecraft
That guy that asked should we help when the sea monster attacked gave me titanic vibes lol
You convinced me in the 1st minute, but the problem is i already play valheim
Thank you for introducing me to such an amazing game zanny
"In Norse mythology you're a b!tch" quick someone put this on a t-shirt
I rarely find a game that I can be 'addicted' to. One that when I get home, I can't wait to play or at least something to look forward to later. I come from the atari 2600 generation, watched em all go from video games to RPG Movies. Once in a blue moon I find something awesome. My last game was Subnautica, then I discovered Valhiem.  I especially like the weather storm effects, the ocean's and the A.I. and physics. Great time killer, like WOW used to be.  It has some quams, all games do. The graphics are so very cool, yet mixed with 'blocks', I guess on purpose (I thought it was my old video card), progress is super slow and there are many 'screw jobs' built in, such as finally being able to take a portal just to find you can't carry ore you mined through it.  My final thought, playing this game makes you realize what it was like in 'the old days'. I'm making a road right now, from a boathouse to my home, and just clearing the rocks and trees, trying to level the ground is astounding amount of work, makes you think about what it was like for real. Great game.
my favorite survival game
10:11 did someone mentioned Brrrrrrrrrrazil?!            alguém mencionou Brrrrrrrrrrasil?!
ts boring asf
play modded valheim plz
Try out tribes of migard  It’s like valheim without out the valheim
skill issue
Zanny: "my gear might be too powerful for the meadows"  *while doing less damage than a bronze spear*
The solo grind is real
Not puppy break for me But puppy invasion so i cant play and its my first second in valheim
I don't like fantasy stuff
Playing this with friends is a lot of fun. But i have no friends😢
When you killed Yagluth but still tend to your fields every 2 days:  Farming? A man of your talents?
What do you have against brazil ?
i just love this man commentary over the chaos of the game
You convinced me at 0.00
its a peaceful life
Love this game
Champ talking like an actual viking during some of that was funny asf.  "FOUL BEAST OF THE SEA" and "NJORD, WHY MUST YOU TEST US"
Let's pretend we're NPCs in an RTS game was the greatest, I laughed so hard, I only missed the Orc peon VOs from Warcraft 3. "Oki doki"
+rep for being funny, giving good content and cute dog -rep how dare you call yourself a gamer and have a girlfriend
Praise the RNJesus of YouTube's algorithm for showing me your channel today(also currently on a Valheim session), and another praise for the absolute banger videos you have made on Valheim <3
Valhiem got quest now        Play it I want some entertainment. 🔫
This game is better than Minecraft
6:42 it is a kraken actually. its not a turtle
OMG I laugh so much ! Thx
Would play if it was free.
If anyone's still not convinced to get it, I have 177.6 hours on steam over a year and a half and I still play the game almost every single day. HIGHLY recommend.   Edit: game also just got a new update and a huge one is in progress.
Lm
This is brilliant
ROCK AND STONE
Hi Zanny, your vid was randomly recommended to me and I'm really enjoying the content! I'm excited to learn about the Zanny lore xD There's probably no way you'll read this but I wanted you to know :)
i was skeptical about buying this game but it is so much fun. my new favorite survival game easily
6:49 I think it's great that they patched that arrow parry and then added it back because it's just fun =)
This game is definitely better with a lot of people
I see Zanny and his friends able to build on Valheim these really good looking bases then there is just me with my simple square shack.
I wish i could but my 6 year old xbox one doesnt want to
Two seconds into the video: "Alright I'm convinced.. I'll turn it on"
16:53, this is exactly what I felt watching that episode.
Valheim is easily one of my top 5 favorite games ever, peak survival souls-like
10:12 as a brazilian..... i conffirm
For Honor? Really? A man of your talents?
"Farming? a man of your talent?"  yup sounds like an isekai main character to me
"i think this is better than minecraft but people arent ready for that talk"  im ready for that talk and i agree B)
valheim is the greatest game
make an open server brooo
What video, the opening was the best 😂
great intro to Fnut, really reminds me of radahn.
Theres no need to convince me Zanny-kun, i would totally play it, if they would launch on Playstation.   So rather help me convience the Devs to port it over.
Hahaha that mandalorian scene buggs the F out of me.
Mass Effect trilogy playthrough - when
Rock and stone brother!
4:42 jumpscared me
I would love to see you and the gang play valheim modded, I think you guys would have a blast!
''Making content, really?! A man of ur talents''
Was this supposed to be a sponsored video or does he just really love valheim
MORE VALHEIM PLEEAAASSEEE!!!!!!
“snut”
Zanny simps his way to Valhalla
I only needed 54 sec to say "no thank you" )
Nows the time for new players to jump in with the Hildirs Quest changes that are coming. The update is going to reduce the tedium and make the grind more tolerable for casual players.
You have convinced me
valheim is literally my favorite game ever i got it last month and have been playing everyday ever since
Fav Zanny vids are Valheim, always miss them!! Glad to see them again
My friends convinced me to begin playing the game, you've convinced me to grind it
i watch all the zanny videos just to see the dogs
Hearing the meme at the intro? Really? A man of your talents?
More Valhiem please
14:34 thats the point, you cant’t odin’s manipulating us
Can you still have fun if you play solo?
I’m tempted to buy it, but I’m worried that I won’t be able to find any to play it with, especially since I don’t often like playing by myself.
WHAT THE FUCK, I WAS MOISTURIZING WHEN HE SAID MOISTURIZED
Glad i didn't buy yet. Thanks.
okay, but is this game fun alone? or maybe with some randoms?
"is this England" not too far off haha
Alright, I'm convinced.
passwordgame made me do this
4:39 this moment made me fall laughing from my chair 💀
yooo ... Im about to downlod this game. Seems super fun if you have the right people to play with
this game only good with friends which i dont have..................
I love Valheim but playing with people is so difficult. I persuaded all my brothers to get it and they all told me I was an idiot for getting it.. Hahah  times are tough.
4:38 and 15:30 What true fear looks like.
This game still melts my PC lmaoo
Try the game with mods, it's a better experience.
lame
Here is the thing I am thinking for 2 mins... Can Miro say the N word?
I don't often miss multiplayer games, but this video.. It really captures the silly fun that's just unique in MP games.
this game actually isnt very good at all unless you are a middle aged man who played runescape when you were 6 and now you have too much time on your hands so you grind a pointless game with unrewarding bosses and boring and unrewarding progression. Everytime you enter a new biome you are immediatley dog piled by enemies that shit on you with their attacks. Me and 3 of my friends went into this game with high hopes and went out dissapointed and exhausted, the game becomes more fun when you start chearing and turn on creative mode. Even zanny used the flight in his first video on this overrated pile of dogshit. don't buy this because its a waste of time and money unless your life already peaked and you have nothing left to do but stare at a computer screen for 100 hours holding down left click and sailing for 30 minutes to fight a shitty boss,
Imagine a server with like a 100 players, and some rules to allow/encourage lore and alliances. Imagine the wars and battles
MORE
Is it just me whenever I ask people to play Valheim they say no it doesn’t look like the game for me yet they play Minecraft
6:47 The funny thing is at one point, the dev removed projectile parrying because it was unrealistic but later on adding it back because "it was fun"
Man, If only I had friends to play this with😢
I had great memories with this game. my friends may have moved on but the tales of valor are forever etched in my memory. I'm looking at you deathsquitoes
the Radahn Festival opener😭😭😭😭HAHHS
I bet Vikings were a lot more like these players than we think.
9:38 a good opportunity missed
❤😂😂😂😂😂
My only complaint to this game was the health and stamina system… it’s be nice if the stats wasn’t permanently 25 hp and 50 stamina..
No way someone else who plays Valheim, finally.
Have to watch the video some other time. For some reason i want to play some Valheim rn
Huevos (now Hurvo) You don’t know what you did. You have ruined my life. I cannot show my face to society again Zanny Ok HURVO
Zanny's real name is John 10:20 😵‍💫
I recently started playing this game after playing destiny for the past 8 years. Feels nice to have a break
if only I had people to play with :/ on god
"RAGNOLF"
Bro is zanny’s real name JON?
Dude, that Thymesia boss theme goes so fucking hard
I'm 4 1/2 minutes in waiting on an uber eats order...This is so much more entertaining than anything on tv now lmao Love the chemistry between everyone playing here! Good laughs. How do I find a server that isnt locked or charging people to play?
I played for 5mins and uninstalled couldn’t figure anything out
AAAAAA FOUND HER AAAA!!! 😂😂
ROCK AND STONE!!!!
I just want to say thank you for the entertainment you provide when showcasing a game. It really sets the mood and shows a great overall perspective of how the game is. I just found your channel because my girlfriend sent me the link to this video and now we will both be trying this game out. Thanks again and you have gained yourself a new subscriber. (Also your friend group seems elite)
Congrats on 1M views!
Have you played project zomboid?
Amon Amarth Destroyer of the Universe! I play it every time I fight a boss
My brother in Christ you need to eat a stamina food
I already have a few hundred hours but I wanted more convincing
Play more jedi survivor I have been waiting 10 years for the game
This would be alot less funny if you had a proper mic
"What a peaceful ride" "Ok were coming up on the plains"  "Ohh okay nevermind" 😂😂😂
Bro made a kitchen for his girlfriend.
you should not lower yhou screams desibulls........ wwwe ,ist must hjear you sream..
Just figured out his name is Jon
She said im stuck and Zanny answers "well dont be"
at 3:13 the video stuck my internet is ok other video is ok. but this video stuck
"It's not mine craft it's not VIKING mine craft it's Valhiem"
Valheim is best game
lolol, zanny just showing his girl the "base" aka the kitchen, haha yeah girls like that right?
What's the name of your father? Snut. Snut means police in swedish slang lol.
So Dark Souls, but good
How many hours you have in game  ?
Already play just came because of Jack Sparrow
Can't believe he called his new channel three zanny and not zanthree
MORE BATTLEFRONT 2!!!
Minecraft is an amazing sandbox game, it's customizable in almost every aspect.  But it has NOTHING in the survival part of the game giving it any fighting chance against Valheim.
His gf sounds like cosmo from the new guardians of the galaxy movie
10:11 eu ri
The Forest is way better
I've been playing this game on stream with a viewer and it's just been so much fun, genuinely, the game is an S tier game with friends. So, so much fun
u convinced me in the first seconds <3 🤣
"Farming, really? A man of your talents?" "Baking, really? A man of your talents?" "Boss fight, really? A man of your talents?"  Lmaoooo
the worst part of this channel is the star wars parts im sorry
fuck.... The intro itself about did it.
Racists unsubbed
i love valheim
Me and my friends who play this game termed parrying ranged attacks 'flabbergasting' the enemy. Peak gameplay. I'd be stunned too if someone slapped my arrow or boulder or whatever cleanly from the air.
This game is a fucking thousand times better than anything bethesda ever put out.
Zanny just what you to know a got an ad about shitting on your video
Play dauntless
You could be a morty voice actor
As an unbuyable product, I am sold.
yes there back to valheim
Aaaaaaahh FOUND HEEEERRR
this game is boring if you have no friends to play with :[ every serven has like 1 or 2 ppl playing
The amount of clips me and my friends have on this game is insane. Absolute comedy
4:41
Anyone looking to play this game on Xbox and doesn't want the game ruined for them with exploiters an cheaters. Leave me a comment. I barley scratched my map exploration but have crafter a big clan house for anyone who like to play off an on, on the same map everyday. Like conan or ark. Hmu. I have not killed bosses or anything. Waiting on a clan.
Nice elden ring reference
Hoping they bring it to ps4 someday…
Fucking bonemass man..
15:48 The "____ Really? A man of your talents?" Skits just get more hilarious as it goes on
been so long since mc donald was build
lmfao this is the video that made me buy valheim
I don't need to watch more than 60 seconds of this to take effect, but I sure as hell want to lets go
4:42 scream of pure terror
Wtf I bought this today and named my world Kattegat… ain’t no way.
Not the Army Men RTS references.
not convinced 👎
“How are we suppose to go to Valhalla if Odin keeps adding content? lol
I am actually playing it solo now, made me play because of your vid 2years ago  Now I see this
Pooping really? A man of your talents
Looks insanely hard by the end but a lot of laughs along the way.
How do i join this valhiem server
Best nd Funniest clips iv seen of Valheim! Great job💪🏾💯💯
so lame also the door she cut like AHHHHHHHH
Unpopular opinion: Minecraft is garbage
Mistlands is like when you accidentally wandered into Caelid before beating margit
Zanny keeps recommending games that require friends to play :(
I want that hammer Thor has.
I love valheim
Sooooo you guys ever kill the plains boss? 😅
Actually a crazy good game
By the time the next bit of content drops Zanny might make another DRG video :)
Zannheim
Valheim vr?
It's a classic in movie's, games, ect... The big ass guy, with the big ass gun will hold the line and die so the rest can escape. This is the way...
The sad thing is, i would most likely play and love this game, if i had someone to play it with

Please play more SW battlefront 2
Ragnolf based
He zanny jedi survivor releases tomorrow
Zanny when are you going to play Jedi survivor the sequel to Jedi fallen order?, I found out the the relationship between cal and Merrin increases and they get closer just like how you shipped them together in the first game
Where is jedi game

But jedi surviver
Check the crates Star Wars

You guys think they made the Seeker Soldier look like a Glyphid Soldier on purpose?
Gonna need more valheim content
And just like that, 13 year olds around the globe all played Valheim 😮😮
Play tears of the kingdom
im sad i had to skip the sea serpent bit cuz i refuse to spoil any sea monsters
Friends and I have been sinking hours into this.
Zanny if you think valheim is addicting the way it is right now, you will never see the light of day again when you try modded valheim, it makes it so much less tedious and much more fun
absolut masterclass boys, seems me and my boys going to try it out
Zanny should make a Sea of Thieves video with Yeti, Champ,  and Solar
Are you getting Jedi Survivor ?
Play Jedi Survivor :v
I’ve been playing on Xbox but after not finding anyone to play with I’ve given in to console commands
ive played valheim with all my friends a while ago, some of the best nights ever, comparable to minecraft binges
Man I need people to play this with, playing and beating this game solo is a pain.
Valheim is one of the best survival game for multiplay. But I don't have friend to play with. I hate you League of Legend
hey zanny play shadow of war
“There is no light attack” lmao
You should try The surge...I personally loved that game and think you might enjoy it aswell.
"Is this England?" had me rolling🤣
F’ing hysterical!
"In Norse mythology you're a  bitch" LMFAO
Sir Zanny I just want to thank you it's because this video I decided to play valheim and I am addicted
No. Go play for honor
Day 1 of asking Zanny to play: Remnant from the ashes.
I know this comment is kind of late but I think it’ll be really cool if you would check out Minecraft legends it released recently and since you’re my favorite YouTuber, I thought I’d ask if he would do a video or two about it please
i love the guy with the nickname "The rooooooook" some profund lore right there
Bro is the best at every game he plays. W zanny
Baking? Really? A man of ur talents?  Zanny: better than destiny  Me agreeing: 👍😁👍
Thank u for the warning
It’s kinda crazy how the hardest boss theme is for a fucking deer 💀💀
I'm convinced.

Hey zanny hoe do you record videos over 10 mins on xbox
Play demons souls or your maidenless
Zanman play wo long dynasty
I really like it, it's as intense or as peaceful as you make it
Every time i watch one of your valheim videos it makes me want to play so bad. Then i log on by myself and get bored within 2 minutes. Need some people to play with
i love this video man gg, valheim has so much potential but is already so good
Zanny please make a video of all commercial breaks
Day 15 of asking Zanny to play Signalis
Can someone please explain to me that noise Zanny edits in some of his videos like a ghost whispering something in the background? I can't hear what it's saying. Is it an old inside joke? Somebody please tell me.
hey zanny i'd love to see you tackle some sniper elite. i feel you'd have a bit of fun with it. love your videos man they brighten my day.
Man try Krumpac mods and you will never return to the old Valheim
YouTube really, a man of your talent's?
the troll just appearing and zannys scream at 4:40 had me fucking dying
Your valheim content is my favorite chaotic videos to watch hahaha thank Odin you made more lol
play D2 doooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo IT
U gonna play survivor when it comes out?
I really like the black sword against those cockroach bastards lol then i got the mistwalker
Omg I missed you so much, I was playing Star Wars: Old Republic and couldn’t stop thinking about you😂
Battlefront 2
Whatever happened to Dj Zanny?
So you can actually go to the ashlands(usually at the bottom of the map)but there’s like zero things to do there other then grab the ore from there(flametal) it has no purpose yet And the base enemies are surtlings
I got it as soon as I saw it I love this game except for those deathsquitos
You gotta play it with mods, you'll never want to go vanilla
zanny should really play ark
Zanny really should try MUCK
"The Queen wants it all" made me chuckle.
Literally bought this game after watching this video, so good.
Have you ever thought of play devil may cry?
Hey zanny. Are you going to play Jedi Survivor when it comes out?
0:05 Bro has no enemies
im still not playing it L bozo
Wait… your name is Jon??
We have big trouble beating Yagluth... I was hoping you'd show it !

Rock and Stone miners !
Zanny your a real one I give u the n word pass hard r and all
Zanny what breed is kirin. Also I love your vids Keep it up man!

I love the way you say “GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!”
Zanny where’s your beyond light gameplay
Thank you for the spoiler warning Zanny ❤❤
zanny pls can you make more clan kids trolling but in halo infinite pretty pls
I loved how you really played up the horror vibes in the mist lands
Im sorry but nothing you say will get me to buy another fucking survival game
Thank you for informing
As soon as I saw that scene in mandolorian. I immediately thought of that part from your deep rock vid
Day 1,367 of asking for more battlefront
Can you play deceive Inc?
I WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME SO BAD, I'M HOPING FOR A PLAYSTATION PORT TO COME
Worth playing alone??
Really boring game
Rock and STONE, my BROTHERS!!!!!!!
3:52 wasted opportunity for a palpatine voice line
no need to convince me i have played it and loved it
The mighty Fnut, son of the mighty Snut
4:28 ROCK AND STONE TO THE HEART
The Slipknot headbanging and hair whipping made me laugh.
the first 1 minute was a pretty good ad
Fnut son Snut😂
Zanny u gotta fight the berserker king and gna in gowr
"Oh a wraith those are like the rarest enemy in the game" *second one shows up "what the fu-"
First is it free or around 10$ Second is it mobile friendly?
Day 13 of asking Zanny to play Signalis
How were there no Brazil jokes in this video
I do have this game but only played a little bit, this video conviced me to play more thanks  zanny
Bro why is your gf so cute?😭😭
New for honor video when?
0:10 I am convinced
It's very poorly optimized Mann.....
"He was working for Leon- ahhhhhhhaaaaaaahhhhAaahHHHH" Inspirational words as always
2:37 and they sacrifice: THE ROOOOOOOOOK
Zanny :Look babe an oven. Zanny gf: What is it for? Zanny: idk
why does it look like it was made for a Gameboy
zanny Hvorfor skriver du hele tiden
Zanny should totally play grounded. It has the co-op of valheim with the terror of subnautica.
I wish I could but the game is horribly optimised
is this modded?? I havent played in a while and dont recognize a lot of these weapons or enemies, but maybe they've added content faster than i thought!
The rizzanny
that thumbnail already got me hooked
I caught the Elden Ring reference lol
w
Lightfall vid?
4:38 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ma fnut, got em
Zanny u gonna play the new Jedi Survivors game when it comes out?
I'm so hyped for Jedi Survivor; you should make a series on it like Fallen Order. Also, I remembered that meme as I was watching the mando episode 🤣
This fuking made my day🎉
Wow, this is the performance xbox players have while pc players are lag spiking standing in place with no acknowledgment from the dev team while pushing out patch after patch specifically for xbox? Even though it seemed perfectly optimized before releasing on xbox? Lol you hate to see it...
sold me in 50 seconds ... i play it again. :D
HE RETURNS FINALLY
Oh I remember now why I stopped watching this guy... he doesnt even have a PC for games but plays on xBox instead... what a normie
Definetly too many people ^^
Somebody played a lot of halo wars 😅
u play it modded or vanilla i have it but never played it lol
Zanny if you want a Warhammer 40k that isn't tactics and more action play darktide
dude wtf, what is it with the fucking Brasil jokes lol
ah Fnut son of Snut your tale made me laugh so much, good video <3
i love how we gloss over the piggyback ride on 10:03
Hey zanny, not sure if you have done it before, but have you ever considered playing sea of thieves? It’s a really great game for having a great time with the boys, and the entire currency system only exists for fashion
F NUT thats how you call him
Play Zomboid, Valheim is my favorite survival but zomboid gets pretty damn close
my favorite part is when she uses danny’s real name, jon, because of course his name is fucking jon
yyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssssssss more valheim
4:40 is probably the hardest I’ve heard this man scream, that one sounded like it was from the soul
I already do and you convince me more
I'm convinced
More DRG please
i wiil never see this game the same again ever since i saw lets game it outs video on valheim
Playing this game solo is not nearly as fun as it is with friends, I envy players with friends....
This game is amazing. However, the devs are very slow with updates. We have had one major update in 2 years. Its going to take a long time for this game to be out in full access.
This is probably one of my favorite VR games ever. The last update broke the mod, but when I had a chance to play it in VR I had a blast! You can legit form a shield wall if your friends also use VR.
If i could only convince my friends to play
''Something about holding that minigun makes you need to sacrifice yourself'' Rip Hevy
Valheim? Really? A man of your talents??
I might try this game out if it released 12 years ago. Idk how people play such a terrible looking game
You should play Grounded.
Is your friend Levy fan? Because he sacrifices THE ROOOOK!!!
Already played it. I don't need convincing, I need the game to be full so I can go back to it again lol
3:58 THE KNOT
Another BANGER from the Zanman
Existing, really? A man of your talents?
I like that he includes his girlfriend in some of his videos it's wholesome
Not gonna lie this hole time i thought his girlfriend was made up and was him with a voice changer now im finding out its true and im an idiot XD
When dark souls 3?! I’m waiting like 3 weeks to see how would u deal with brothers
It has convinced me well the son of Snut. I shall Berk on a magnificent adventure of trail and pain. Can’t wait to see my old friend… Znut.
i miss when zanny used to upload streams to too zanny maybe he will continue the long streams on his other channels
"it's a zanny life..."
IMA be honest its only fun with friends its a 9\10 with friends and a 8.7 without also mods mod the fk out of it and its waaaaay better
I'm so sure I've heard the thing you said at the end before "Something about holding that minigun makes you NEED to sacrifice yourself"
One of you missed the opportunity to call yourself lagnar
When are zanny and female zanny getting married
You should play project zomboid next
Pfft the Radahn cutscene reference was god tier
mannnn if only i had friends to have such adventures lol
Zanny playing 4d chess getting more people to buy Valheim just to get the Ashlands and Deep North updates faster
I swear this guy makes everything look 10 times more fun
i will die if you dont play battlefront 2
"Boss fight, really? A man of you-" "SHUT THE FUCK UP."
Day 12 of asking Zanny to play Signalis
no star war :(
that Odur theme gave me PTSD flashbacks
Step 1: Have friends
what's the light attack look like? .... there is no light attack 😎 *walks away* 😎
IM DYING 4:37 🤣🤣😂😂
15:58 ayo????
Damn I remember this game back when it was initial beta, looks like there has been good work done
I fcking love Valheim, but none of my friends does. :(
this game looks great
I swear these videos are so good, they are dripping in quality.
Valheim is my favorite game of all time and it’s not even close
I was hoping you'd make more Valheim videos!  This was the first game I favorited on steam
Is this game on PlayStation?
I love your Valheim videos they are actually the reason I found your channel.
it's so funny that u are using the thymesia themes in a vanilla game
just finished vinland saga so um yeah im getting this
Like if zanny should play ape wars
How about 17 minutes of trying to convince yourself to play Skyrim?
Albion and valheim player now have something in common They are go finding Brazilian
02:17 Maybe the reason Kattegat is un-usurpable is b/c it's so easy to just usurp it again. Kinda like a big game of Kattegat hot potato.
I would play it again, if it actually got any new content/optimization/bugfixes/Less grinding  So I wouldnt right now. I'll catch the next big update though.
FINALLY MORE VALHEIM
i would. but ive got no friends
I need an hour long version of  the Zanny ending theme. That shit slaps!
Ah, that altered General Radahn cutscene speech at the beginning. :D
Jon when's another destiny 2 video on lightfall?
I need a group to play this with lol
i'm convinced
When I played valheim I got a consistent 15fps
The radio transmitter had me died thank you so much for the laughs 😂
Bro everytime I see a video of a game he play sometime ago it’s like that Gustavo meme with the flashbacks 💀
Ngl that seeker soldier attacking you out of the mist was fucking terrifying.
Fuck u, now I need to gather the bois
I fr thoght it said Warden instead of valheim, and was thrilled too see For Honor return. Yet my hopes were crushed.
Zanny clan needs a cook reeaall bad.  My boys were superb conquerors not just thanks to skill, but also my high quality food.  My first task after a boss is defeated, is always stockpiling THAT GOOD STUFF from the next region
Today I learnt Zanny's name is Jon. He truly is Jon Darksouls.
1:52 Almost caught you saying "General Radahn was cursed ever to wonder..."
Ragnolf 💀
Man cut out like 7 months of grinding
Brother this is the beautiful content I’ve been thirsting for. YouTube has been in a drought😂🫶🏽
the first min of the vid got mynlike and also sold me to look into this and get my friends to look into this; THATS how you do an intro, showing a fun time with friends and exhilarating exploration and jolly cooperation
play overwatch 2 and make a video on how trash the new lifeweaver is :)
you mean 17 and 30 SECONDS of you trying to convince me to play Valheim
Zanny and his team with high-tier gear against the elder: *struggles* average Bow and fire arrow user: chad
Jon Darksouls plays valheim
LOL this was great!! I highly recommend trying War Thunder with the bois it would make some great content (also try test flights they are hilarious)
Y'all should try mods. Oh the chaos it would bring.
Why isn’t it called Threeam Zanny? Missed opportunity
Yo, Valheim is such an amazing game. Played it since day 1 and I don't regret it! I'm so happy to see you and the boys playing it!
Valheim is still in early access and yet is a near perfect game, I will forever sing this games praise.
ROCK AND STO- em i mean VALHEIM VALHEIM VALHEIM VALHEIM PALHEIM
You know it’s a good video when Champ is yelling war crys so inaudible that it has to be subtitled 😅
That clip with the blue giant got me good xDD
Hi Zanny, I recently saw your video on FarCry 6 (I may be a little late to that one) and considering that was your first FarCry game, I think you got a rough introduction to the series. FarCry 4 is my favorite FarCry of all time and I think you would really enjoy it because not only does the gameplay hold up to todays standards but the story is actually good and your character is voiced! FarCry 5 is also solid.
Valheim is such a good game. It's my favourite survival game ever. I wish there were more playthroughs on YouTube for it. Music is really underrated imo (meadows are my favourite).
small side-note, kattegat means cat-hole in my language XD. Just so you can come to understand why it gets usurped so often XD
Zanny should play Sea of Thieves with the bois
Playing solo is pain
Thanks, now I’m playing valheim instead of studying for my exam. As a side note, why are coffee stain such champions of game development?
ZANNY'S VALHEIM IS BACK YESSSS
Let me guess the name of Fnut's mother, is it Sl-
The Queen probably did that to Zanny on purpose
The more dogs Zanny gets the more channels he has
"Something about holding that giant minnigun makes you want to sacrifice yourself"  *Heavy flashbacks ensue*
My friends are dumbest thing is ever because they are not playing this game with me xd
Valheim is one of the best games I have played in a long time. I absolutely love it. Highly recommend.
0:27 got me shitting my pants 🤣
Out of all the Comedy in this video, The funniest bit was you uploading the same garbage years later without evolving as a YouTuber or an individual. Patiently awaiting the next Circus Upload 🎪☝️🤓🤡
7th grade humor
We need more videos with zannys gf. Its so wholesome i wanna get ran over by a train😊
Now it’s Johnny depp? What’s next? Keanu?
I don't have gaming friends to play with, unlucky.
ZANNY FOUR: INTO THE ZANNY-VERSE  Imagine that...
Why does the fact that your name is Jon seem so weird to me  ?
I think Robbaz will enjoy this game
Zanny you should play team fortress 2
Awesome video, love to see wat you guys have build.
Yes I've been begging more valheim and it's finally heree
Another nice game to play with homies
Love how Zanny’s new “hardcore focus mode” music has lately been that one boss fight theme from Thymesia
Zanny turning their FOB/Viking warlord base into a domestic living space for his wife is honestly life goals like.  Once you get basic necessities for a base in a game you kinda just wanna start adding in the little stuff that makes it nicer
Official pc sessions
You should play ark
Zanny's gf is one of rare women who is happy that he built her a kitchen XD
this is so funny
2:34 My brain: "And then they sacrifice: the roooooook!" I wasn't expecting such a man of culture in the party
Man really used the leviathan theme
15:31 is an all-time Zanny moment
Hyped for Jedi Survivors and a new Valheim video
Zanny!!! You're in the trending section!!!
you should play sea of thieves
Bro now I’m just Plain curious of How much Detail he puts in his Thumbnails
Love the Vikings references
Bro where is re4 remake
Honestly, when Valheim dropped on Xbox me and my friend were so excited to play it, but we literally cannot get multiplayer to work at all and it really kills the mood. Solo Valheim just doesn’t hit the same 😔 watching Zanny play it is the second best option tho
I knew this game had to make a comeback on your channel and I’m so happy for it. Last 2 were peak
“Lurking, really? A man of your talents”
As soon as it comes to ps5 will play.
yo, when Jedi: Survivor comes out in about 10 days are you going to cover it like you did fallen order and make fun of Pervy the Purge Trooper more?
What can we do to bring for honor back.
No one gonna talk about how smooth he slapped that radahn reference up in their?  Lol
First time I played this I was on acid. Was a very fun experience 👍
my favorite survival game is grounded
Me patiently waiting for a lightfall video
Damn, it's been 2 years didn't know the series is still going.
Zannys name is John? 10:23
To much sailing, and not enough content on the vast seas.
It's honestly crazy watching the dogs grow up
Your gf sounds like Bmo from Adventure Time
The fact that while watching Mando last week all I could think of was Zanny playing Deep Rock shows how cliched that death was 😂
5:27 reminded me of  CAPTAIN  yay LOOOOOOOOK!!!  😂😂
YES I LOVE YOUR VALHEIM VIDS
I really wish I has someone to play valhiem with :(
I will never play this game but I'll watch you guys play anytime
The audacity. To use GOD's name as a cuss word. Shame on you.
I already play valheim
I just started so glad to see you playing
Hey Danny when ASA LAUNCHES would you be interested in playing it ?
I can't play 😢
I love this. I wish I had morons- I mean friends to play this with
I thought about that DRG moment when watching the Mando episode too
Too bad playing solo is nowhere near as good which stops me from being able to play
I think you need longer puppy brakes
Damn, it's been 2 years didn't know the series is still going.
The return of the "a man of your talents" gag made me inordinately happy XD
GOD DAMN IT IM IN WITHDRAWAL LET ME LEAVE VALHEIM I HAVE OTHER GAMES THAT I WANT TO PLAY LET ME LEAVE AAAAAAAAAAAA
IT HAS BEEN 84 YEARS.... BUT HE RETURNS TO TRY SUCK ON ODINS BALLS
bros this game is incredible
zanny smacking that seeker like my 2005 -  level 6 combat RuneScape account hitting a scorpion trying not to die.
10:47 a true viking, made a whole-ass kitchen for his woman
Recording? Really? A man of your talents?
7:05 too true
"safest brazillian area"... bro you didnt had to do us like that tho.
deep rock video
Missed opportunity on “where’s my super FNUT?” 😂
U had me at Vikings
Those first 50 seconds where enough to convince me 😂 "there is no light attack" 😂😂
I've been waiting for this video for the longest time, and it did not disappoint. Funniest shit ever tanginaaaaaa
Bro that scream at 440 has me DDYYYIINGGGG
I own valheim since it was on sale but I don't usually play multiplayer should I play it lol
This is exactly how me and my friends felt when we played this game, the mistlands are evil, the plains are evil and the bosses are really cool except for the Queen which is near impossible without others helping also the Seekers and Gjalls are nightmare enemies
Thanks for spoiler warning❤
Sounds like the guy from flashgitz
No light attack and no skill line.😂
Slipknot in a Zanny video? I must be in heaven
I literally said the exact same thing when watching that episode, idk live action Star Wars besides the original trilogy will always be goofy to me
Zanny please don’t get mad, but I’m not going to watch any of your Jedi survivor vids because I need to play the gaaame
4:10 this was the most accurate pretention of a cnc Tiberian sun npc XD
Can the puppy segments be longer pls. Thank youu
I feel like I’d have way more fun playing games if I had friends Lo”
u get a like just for the dog segment
Nice one zanman
Man i love this game but i dont have friends to play it with. Well not that but just trying to organise friends to actually get on the game... feels growing up man...
6:10 that Njord part killed me! who was that?
Halo wars 2 please
baking better than Destiny?! Destiny is life friend.
And he sacrifices THE ROOOOOOOOOOOOOK
4:40 really got me haha
I agree, Valheim is way better than Minecraft.
Please play Zelda Botw or the new one when it comes out
Fnut, son of Snut
Is it weird that I'm more hyped about the zanny video that will surely follow Jedi: survivor than the actual game?
Finally a new Valheim video.  About damn time for a new Valheim video.  Really? A Valheim video? A man of your talents?  It's a fun filled life in Palheim.
Make a destiny video again, I beg of you lord.
I stopped playing Valheim around the Hearth and Home update  And only recently got back into it and have cleared most of the Mistlands save for the Queen. Man, a group boss raid like that is fucking epic
*slowly turns head* did... did she just call you... Jon?
It pleases me greatly to see you return to valheim
Day 1 trying to get Zanny to play dead by daylight  (its on game pass)
ZANNYS NAME IS JON??
The elden ring reference of radahn lmao
does this game difficulty increase if you are with friends?
I love and will always love your valheim videos the most!
will you ever try Project Zomboid? it even has multiplayer, surely a nice try if you like survival games!
Playing Valheim for the first time with all my friends was by far the funniest gaming experience I've had in my life. We were literally laughing our asses off. We still remember and recall some hilarious situations and it seems like those memories are going to stay with us for ever. What an adventure!
Using help while fighting a boss .....really a man of your talents
Player: lets head back cause its getting dark Zanny: its fine, lets keep exploring  2 seconds later  Zanny: AAAAAAAAAAA
Slipknot confirmed to be in ZannyVerse I am so happy
Just the intro makes me wanna play
I’d honestly love for u guys to play terraria, just feel like u guys would have a lot of fun
Wake up Babe, Zanny just returned to Valheim
Hve to stop watching cause I haven't enterend the mistland... still can't find the stone that takes me to the next boss
This Radahn intro goes harder than it should
Just got into valheim with it being on gamepass and me and friends are having tons of fun with it. Glad to see it on the channel again!
Zanny really built his girl a kitchen goddamn 😂
NJORD WHY DO YOU TEST US!? 🦶
I can’t watch half of this video because I don’t want to spoil the mistlands yet
FNUT SON OF SNUT
Zanny should play risk of rain 2
Reading comments? Really? A man of your talent?
100% better than minecraft has 1 issue and the fact its like 2 pixels legit hurts my eyes when playing
Yo if there ain't no pink or yellow poncho in fallen order what's Zanny supposed to wear?
Valheim is the most underrated game that I have played. I hope they will bring paid DLC, Expansion or something that I can support them.. I have over 1000+ hours and paid just 16 Euro. I would support these developers.
Hey zanny. My dog died recently and your videos have been the only thing cheering me up
I always say that this is just Viking Minecraft and I love it.
What game did the music from 11:16? come from?
Got talked into buying this game couple of years ago as everyone on discord was playing it... finally bought it and they stopped playing
Only true gamers found three zanny through the community post
I love this game
Disappointed, I checked the second channel and there's no new Valheim content yet :( Why did you lie to me, Zanny?
3:46 "Snut" is swedish slang for cop. lol
>boss is literally called "The Queen" >they are surprised when it summons mobs to help itself ??????
I'm sorry, but you're legally not allowed to play Ride of the Valkyries unless you're in the air. I don't make the rules, they were decided from 1955 to 1975 in what used to be Saigon, currently Ho Chi Minh City because, even as an American, the Americans clearly lost. Turns out, the people who won their independence by foregoing traditional war tactics and using guerilla tactics weren't prepared to go up against a native population that foregoes traditional war tactics and uses guerilla tactics. SOMEHOW we didn't see that coming, which really sucks for all those dead Americans and Vietnamese who fought purely because "communism bad" (communism IS bad, but we literally killed about 3 million people from both sides over the fight against the Viet Cong, which, even in modern times, is still like a whopping 1-2% of the American population, which is the THIRD LARGEST POPULATION ON THE PLANET at roughly 300 million)
"why is your viking British?" Because that's a thing? The vikingr were largely Danish and invaded the English countryside, holding it long enough to establish what was known as the Danelaw, which was more or less a portion of England that was conquered and governed by the King of Denmark instead of the English king, which obviously blended both the people and cultures such that you would 100% see vikingr that speak with a typical English accent while still identifying as Danish (however, the modern English accent is a fabrication made by the modern English people after the American Revolution, American English is what they would have sounded like in the time of the Danelaw)
Ur Valheim vids always make me happy  You introduced me to the game a long while ago, and it’s been awesome! I’ve been playing with my gf recently and we’ve loved it
8/10 puppy break, needs more Kirin
Zanny, I am fervently demanding that next time, we get a close-up of all doggo faces. Miro is adorable, but I NEED to see them all up close because they're so goddamn CUTE! Please, my own pupper is on her way out because she has lymphoma, so I could use some cute happy puppy faces
Deep Rock and Valheim have the same publisher, not developer.
I mean, if you go slowly and carefully, Sir Zandril, the Ultimate Master of Ubisoft game For Honor, can conquer any combat, for he is the Ultimate Master of Ubisoft game For Honor. You can tell by his sickass drip.
If he liked the seekers I'm sure Zanny would just looooove Grounded.
Hi Danny think you would like ark also love ur vids :)  Hopefully can see more dog breaks
Man i wish I had friends to play
4:40 YES - my gamepley in 2s nuttshell
OOOO valheim , lets fkn goooooooo
The Mass is so fucking annoying solo.
This game is not better than Minecraft and I'll tell you exactly why: mods. I can make Minecraft into almost anything these days with the use of mods and different versions, and while Valheim DOES have mods, it doesn't let me turn Valheim into fucking Factorio and I can do that in Minecraft with the Manufactio modpack. Minecraft is several hundred different games at once with mods.
I like to imagine a parried arrow gets grabbed out of the air and thrown back into their face like a vikingr ninja
0:28 no, its france
>your friends who are ten feet away are being mauled by a kraken "Should we help?"
More halo infinite 🙏
Fun fact: Viking is an activity, specifically the activity of raiding and pillaging foreign settlements while one who participated in those actions was a vikingr, something the modern world often misunderstands. There were no vikings, only vikingr.
45 seconds was all it took for me to fucking download it
Big surprise, the publishing company of the Most Based Game Ever, DRG, also published the Based Viking Simulator that is Valheim. Why based? Because being a woman has no impact on your physical prowess like a true Vikingr despite the real life fact that women are physically weaker than men by nature of testosterone.
>when the boss hits you with his Chidori Well, that left a hole in my heart. Just an absolute gaping hole in my chest. If only someone could fill it with their fist and put me out of my misery like my name is Rin Nohara and you're Kakashi Hatake (in case you didn't get the joke, that's how Rin died, she asked Kakashi to kill her to stop the Tailed Beast inside her from going on a rampage in Konohagakura, so he reluctantly used his Chidori to pierce her chest, something Obito, who witnessed the act in secret, never wanted to forgive until Naruto and Kakashi give him the Talk no Jutsu about the truth and he accepted that Kakashi wasn't at fault)
Four Zanny will just be puppy clips
Excuse you, Odin resides in Asgard, not Valhalla
Oh the first playthru: AAAAA, SEAMONSTER!!! FUUUUCCCCK! Second playthru: o, seamonster. Let`s harpoon it to the ground and slay it for its flesh and scales. Third: hey, seamonst.. pffft.
fashionheim when?
"what is a schizo?" A miserable pile of secrets! But enough talk, have at you!
I wish I could join your valheim haha
You're not allowed to say shit about their development timeline, they released the game and immediately it exploded and made them millions of dollars, but that doesn't change the fact that it's literally a whole 10 people that make up Iron Gate Studio.
I think you should play slime runcher
deep rock?
The dreams of your character suggest that you died valiantly in battle, and Odin, being lazy, has sent you here, to clean up a mess he made. Because you are the most badass warrior he could find.
You have the best videos xD
I like Fnut more then Knut
There is no light attack 😂
One comment of me asking you to make more for honor vids  Please make more for honor vids too
play ark
I want to play this game but I have no friends who own the game, I own it but I want to play it with my group of friends lol
Not uploading Valheim for 1.5 years? Really? A man of your talents?   Nah but im fkn glad you posted Valheim again, such a fun game :D
nice puppy break
Oi zanny When will you play monster hunter world iceborne?!?
Finally another Valheim vid
Damn this game looks fun if you got friends
0:35 the ROOOOOOOOOOOOK, Levy having a worldwide impact
This is an enjoyable ass video
Ah man. I resisted 2 years ago. But now I think I gotta play this.
2:36 they sacrifice the ROOOOK
There is no light attack
There is an amazing mod for this game!
Everyone was saying “deep rock video deep rock video” what we really needed was a VALHEIM VIDEO
very nice video can you play sekiro again with some mods or something
If a storm trooper got laid that would be the first thing he’d ever hit. By that logic if Zanny and I … wait 😳
brilliant video thanks Zanny loved the puppy break. Could you teach my street rescue dog how to play like your dogs (he tries but still doesn't get fetch or tug of war) they look very happy.
i live between 3 citys so im pretty much fucked if the bombs fall ima go outside to make sure the blast takes me and not the radioation or famine
She : Im Stuck  Zanny : Well Dont be RUNNNN !!
I've waited 2 years for this video
a surprise to be sure, but a pleasant one
I would love to play valhiem more but none of my friends have it not want to play it 😭
Why its always Rock and Stone, not Rock and Steel? Rock and Stone is kinda redundant, is it not?
Finally more zanheim
nice, another Valheim vid from zanny and the gang!
who is the new white dog (havent watched his videos in like a few months)
Best game I’ve played in the last 10 years. Hope when it’s fully released it’s forever solidified with  legendary status like mine craft
15:30 "She just disappeared" famous last words
Valheim is actualy the best game
watching this cause i got no one to play this game with
You know what you have to do. Lightfall has been out for almost two months. You played the campaign. I saw it in the SirD video
the radahn speech mixed with valheim was perfect
I love your videos Jon
you had me a "viking themed survival game" also i thought huevos/hurvo was dead
"Going to put my end game gear in that box..."  Ten seconds later: "F this... out comes the end game gear for the Eldar."  Mistlands Drop: "I wanna go back to the Meadows."  Sounds legit.
after like 2 weeks building my mountain fortress next to the boss....I was like... it's time to build in the plains now... again xd
I love the "Boss fight. Really? A man of your talents?" quip as war is fu**ing occurring XD
"RETREAT!!! RETREAT!!!!"  Yeah. That's Valheim.
The legend of hurvou continues
Just started playing very pog game
I hope zanny plays jedi survivor all the way.
does anyone know what song my guy playing at 14:05
Jon? 🤨
I'm really for pervy to make a return wjen surviver comes out
when zanny drop music
“A man of your talents?” Zanman: Shut the fu-
Hush little baby don't you cry, they not gonna come at 9.
One of my favorite games right here, spent hours getting rekt by serpents on the great raft voyage
I would play it but one small issue: nuh uh
A good trade deal
i just send this to all my gamer friends xd
I really want to see more valheim on this channel
The sheer amount of chaos generated in these videos is such a delight to witness.
This game looks really fun if only the devs weren’t dumb af and completely deletes people’s progress with only a notification telling people that their shit is being deleted instead of actually fixing the issue.
His boyfriend's girlfriend, "Are you dramatically looking at the horizon, AGAIN!?!?"
the ammount of times his GF keeps telling him to sleep through out his videos
zanny zanny zanny...sutch a shame i already do play it, i got it the day it came out on series x
You have just convinced me to play valheim
I love all of the star wars and elden ring jokes
This is such weird timing i just started playing again like a week ago
After 86 years we finally got another Valheim video!!!! thx Zanny
bro I look at zannys recent achievements on Xbox to see what’s the next video he’s going to post
it took one. thank you for the additional 16.
I play valheim hundreds of hour and the build is never bore me❤
I forgot what this game was then saw the deer fight
"Uploading Valheim, really? A man of your talents?" "It's a peaceful life."
YES! Finally the evidence for my friends to replay valheim is here!
This brings me back.  Especially with the “a man of your talents”
you should play destiny again 🤐
sea of thieves when?
15:00 true lmao . destiny really fell to L tier with lightfall . i stoped playing that shit got a refund and was never as happy when i stoped playing that game lol
Yo he’s back
Never stop making Valheim videos. This is one of the best survival games ever made.
Lost 1 tomb stone and experienced a world reset. Never going to get back for sure
Lost 1 tomb stone and experienced a world reset. Never going to get back for sure
How did nix grow so fast?
Hey yo, i picked up sea of theives. plays with me bro. i got you. we can sloop it up
soon to be a real cough
Can you play vallheim vr?
hey. im a man who wants his funnys
Please play dead island 1 or 2 with the group i feel it’d be hilarious
WHY IS IT NOT CALLED PUPPY PAUSE
having an accident or desease was actually a problem, wich familie would ussually donate a sacrafice, like a sheep or something
ty for adding doggy clips they made the video go from 10/10 to 15/10
Me and my brother been no lifting past two days and I’ve been up for over 11 hours 😂
Bro my group could go kill the Queen right now, but noone wants to play right now. IT'S BEEN MONTHS OF ME GETTING BLUE BALL'D.
too bad it gets updated only once a year despite bean in EA for millennia
I need to return to Valheim with the bois
Zanny. Will you be playing Survivor when it comes out?
Ayo it's still going lfg
"I think this game's better than Minecraft" I'm so happy that you said that cuz I literally just refeer Valheim as "Minecraft 2" with my friends and happy to see that the joke kinda runs among others too. I love Minecraft and have much nostalgia for it but my God Valheim is just more fun and enjoyable sometimes. This is still labelled as "early-access" so it makes me hyped to see what the full game will be like since this already feels so good and fleshed out.  It's also funny that both games are made by Swedish people x)
At 1:48 Zanny had me believing he was the narration voice in the game. 😂😂😂 He should seriously consider doing some voice acting!
Video 4 of asking zanny to play wild hearts (play on ps5 tho)
Puppy breaks has been the greatest thing on this channel for so long I LOVE THEM
Day 11 of asking Zanny to play Signalis
Damn I love Zanny when he wants to scream with his friends but more likely whispers the scream 😂😂
If zanny does not play jedi survivor on the hardest difficulty im unsubscribing, therefore you lose 0.000001% of your subscribers, so be warned.
I dont need convincing this game is awesome
It's not Minecraft its VALHEIM
i wonder when zanny will do a face reveal
Im tired of valheim tbh
Playing Valheim? A man of your talents?
"Valheim is not a popular game"  All reviews: Overwhelmingly positive (345k)  steamcharts: 34k avg peak daily
Hey Zanny, i dont think you will read this, but as its my favorite game, i would love to see you try Sea of Thives
"Valheim really? A man of your talents"
the adventures of panut
Finally new zanny valheim!!
Whoever came in to save you, screaming FNUT! He's got the rizz of a Vahallan God.
I’ve only just found you. And you feel good enough to sleep to. That’s a compliment cause I’m picky as all fuck lol
Dude modded Vaheim is 100x better you gotta try it
I have a long play time on valheim, it has been one of my most favourite games I have ever play.   I have many memories on this game with friends and am so happy zanny has revisited the game
my man, game looks like shit
FINAALYY
Valheim is exactly the reason why you don’t need to have triple A development to have fun
can we get a fourzanny with twitch vods uploaded
the "are you dramatically looking at the horizon again?" got me xD
Your fathers name was "Cop"??
Out of the cold and foggy night came the Viking man, the Fnut ,And all the monsters knew, fnut man in motion king of the ocean
really cool video
Indeed Valheim is better than Minecraft but none of my bros realize that so I have to play Minecraft
It is now confirmed that the directors watch zanny's videos
Very nice video bud, but whens the new For Honor Video coming out.
Best Game ever ❤️
Started playing a week ago,  been on it non stop, looks way more fun with friends, but I have none of those.
The absolute fear in that scream 🤣 4:42
My brother is gonna buy me valhiem after I pass my exam 🤓🤓🤓
Valheim game to game pass and I’ve been obsessed with it
0:15 LMAO, from what series is "Ragnolf" from XD
17 minutes of me trying to convince you to play Valheim  Yes I still don't have the money to buy the game :')
nah fuck valheim, i almost broke up with my girl because of this game XD
Ty Mr.Zenny for make my day 😄
How did you not discover that /cheer emote with a pickaxe makes for an authentic ROCK AND STONE experience?
Zanny feet for FREE???
I swear ever since Zanny has played Deep Rock Galactic we will always get at least one a DRG reference in every video  Rock and Stone!
who is jon
hey zanny when is the next destiny 2 vid? Edit: i wanna see you and your clan to do lightfall
16 minutes too long zanny, you had me at minute 1 XD
God I just love this game so much, makes me happy to see zanny play it as a bunch mf my friends just got into it
wellcome to brazil
I love pickles
Katagat has no meaning or significance after ragnar dies. It's just another trading post/fishing village now
7:55 I AM THE GREAT MIGHTY POO AND IAM GOING TO THROW MY SHIT AT YOU
Yessss more valheim! one of my top 3 favorite games. 600 hours and counting lol
Ever considered ark?
Was looking through your channel yesterday for valheim content, awesome
pro boat driving tip. the boat is a kind of instance. the first person on board "owns" the boat and will be the one with the most fluid game. now the trolly part. ownership changes if you open the storage of the boat. your boat will do a dead stop if u do this. enjoy
if only the combat system was more dynamic, deep and responsive, this would've been goty material
you should try the community mods next i valheim
Odur’s theme kicking in at 11:16 while zanny is fighting a seeker soldier is great editing. What a great boss theme
I would but I don’t have any friends
Despite the slowpoke update(s), valheim still feels more fun to play compared to other similar game imo
"Snut" is slang for cop in Norway lmao
“Boss fight? Really? A man of your talents?” Absolutely got me, lmao
God dammit i only needed one 1 min to convince me to play it
i love this game to death but honestly i was so disappointed with the mistlands update
My life would be complete if the next FromSoft game would just be their Dark Souls gameplay in a valheim world with crafting...
For a moment at the start i thought you asked VaatiVidiya to play Valheim with you
okay time to play valheim again...
wouldn't be at a Zanny Valheim video without at least one "a man of your talents?" joke
9:37 - STEPBRO MOMENT
I just finished the game yesterday And i absolutely loved it. Its so great that you made a video about it
Hope we all enjoyed the underground but it’s the closest thing to a deep rock video we’ll have for another year
Nice
Do you think you will ever release a longer version like a couple hours I would love too watch it
Me who was hyped as fuck when I saw it was coming to game pass 😄
please Sir Zanny, Make More Valheim Videos !!!
Nice reference to Radahn 01:57
Make a video on re4 remake
I would love to play this but I don't have any friends that enjoy this type of game
Request:play ark survival evolved I would like to hear your screams
I got into valheim recently but I play on old gen Xbox one S and it’s like playing a slideshow when more than one enemy appears at a time
11:33 this is how he dealt with raider
At 10:52 he says look an oven what for. For u to cook in
Battlefront 2 one last time ? Before the servers close
Ayo Zanbini didn’t even know that was you on the voice over at 1:48 until you started talking about the devs lol. My mans got pipes(not homosexually)
Holy god Zanny on valheim again? One of my favourite games
Glad to know the boys actually called him Hurvo since his name got misspelled in the last Valheim video
Thank you for telling about the spoiler :>
Valheim is the reason i subbed back in the day
Dude I swear zanny and his girlfriend is like showing each other their builds in minecraft and shit it’s so cute
4:41 My anus slammed shut like a pressure sealed bulkhead when I saw that Troll, fucker just materialized out of nowwhere...
6:59 lol who's the head hunter?
The Puppy breaks will always be tve most wholesome on YouTube
JON??? WHY IS NO ONE ELSE TALKIMG ACKNOWLEDGING THIS??
How does your guys's building system work? I don't really like playing with other people because it always leads to eyesore structures on the map but yours has so many people but still nice looking buildings
looking for merchant makes me wanna drown
Fun fact "witness me" is an Ana from overwatch line
Valheim Forever: Ashland's next drop and can't wait to see what adventures that may bring.
W video
FNUUUUUUUUUT!!
Zanny had his first conversation with a women 🎉🎉🎉
what is the song they sing at 14:10 ?
radahn speech?
We'll I'm a solo Spartan so make a solo run
Valheim music is top tier
Imagine not playing years ago
I pre ordered the deluxe edition for survivor  Yes I am a virgin
Fourth channel gonna be called: one of manny
yes i just started playing this
Amazing video!
Sold
"The ROOOOOOK" I see... you're playing with the men of culture
it looks better than Minecraft but my computer isnt ready to have that talk :(
The title lied it isn't 17 minutes it is 17 minutes and 33 seconds
i hate how i know the country year and song slipknot were playing in like a 1 second clip
10 million copies sold for Valheim is quite popular!
There is absolutely no way in fuck you’re convincing me fnut isn’t “F-Nut”
You Son of a Bitch, I'm In
looks fun. too bad im broke
ive been ADDICTED to this game, hopefully they update it on xbox soon cause idk what to do when my series is over
already 5D chess moves ahead of you. played since it released
This is uncanny, I literally just watched the older videos of Valheim.
Fnut Snutson
Will you be playing metal gear rising revengeance?
Do you have valheim videos that are less compilation
Didn't work
game
I'm beginning a petition for Zanny to play Risk of Rain 2
Holy shit more Valheim ty Zanny
Pest control in the mist woods, really  A man of your talents?
Hard pass but thank you.
0:01 THE LINE HE SAID THE THING!
Play no man’s sky
No one is ever truly gone
Valhiem was a cool idea, and still could be. If they allowed you to customize the settings on your worlds. Like Aggro range, density of mob spawns/power scaling, and remove the energy. I hate the friggen energy bar, and food based healing only works in Minecraft cause its a staple, its super whack. Why not use plants and stuff to make bandages or healing shiz. The games default settings are really what I feel makes the novelty of the game wear off quickly and showcase its bugs. Esp when playing multiplayer, the laggy parts really start to become apparent and messes up the immersion. Something that MC doesn't really suffer from much esp now where you have 200/300/1000 player servers. If Valhiem could pull that off THAT would be sick. Imagine building a clan in a public server with other clans spread all around. Making trade roots and building out the lands.
Zanny is like Groot showing his work to her girlfriend. That's wholesome.
His name would be Fnut Snutsson, and I think that’s funny
Its been 84 years
And he sacrifices....... THE ROOOOOOOK
Zanny star war battlefront 2004
the puppy break is the best place
You defintely stayed true to your Word, i know want to Play Valheim, but i cant so iam pissed
Rock and Stone!
Yeti when he realises Zanny's third channel has already more subscribers than him for the same content😂
play more valheim and try modded minecraft
Great to see more Valheim content from you! Love it!
i mean the old wan
pls play battlefront but the og wan
Zanny Valheim video? Dont mind if I do.
Wait, your name is Jon!?
I would watch this for hours
4:28  "DID I HEAR A ROCK AND STONE !?!"
I wish I had people to play with
______? Really, a man of your talents? Easily the best Velmeim meme format lmao
Favorite survival? I always found Subnautica to be the most captivating in terms of gameplay, and story.
17 minutes of me ignoring your attempts to convince me to play valheim
FCK yeaaaaaahhhh VAHEIM WHOOO
I literally just watched your 2 year old video on valheim just to realize you posted a new one just now😂
And when you get sick of that monsters shit! Find a cheater sword.
MORE VALHEIM AWOOLOOLOO
Love how the first thing zanny shows to his girlfriend is the kitchen  “Look babe it’s your room”
THIS GAME AGAIN?! LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOO
You failed
Destiny 2
I already love valheim but I run it on a Xbox one s not series s just s so it lags a lot. I am hoping to upgrade to get a better gaming set up to enjoy valheim more because it is an awesome game!
Valheim really and man of your talent
954
I usually only watch Zanny on this channel, but ive gotten into destiny recently so I was wondering if he still posts content about that game in any of his other channels or on twitch
Dying? Really? A man of your talents?
10 seconds into the video and Zanny wanting the peaceful farming life makes sense.
Nah. I’ll stick with Odyssey.
If feels so wrong disliking a Zanny video, but I cannot support Minecraft slander.
C&C Tib Sun voice lines.  Can still remember them instantly to this day. 4:10
god i need this game to get 10x more exposure, me and the boy been grinding it since it hit game pass, shits top tier
Check warframe
The joy you must get from playing with friends on this game was so amazing thank you for spreading this joy to people like me I really needed a video like this you have no idea
Return of Palheim
day 7 of asking zanny to play south park the fractured but whole
Sorry zanny, you can never peak the viking speak of the purple text dude. Man's been weaned on fenrir milk or some shit.
You don't have to convince me, I love this game!
one of my fave games cant lie
I tried playing this game solo cause my friends were busy with stuff  Worst mistake of my life
Fun fact about Fnut's father's name, "Snut" is swedish slang for "cop".
he brought back the boss music no way
I refunded this game pretty quickly. The solo experience is nothing like this.
His CHIDORRIII 😭😭😂
Jokes on you I watch YT in PS4
Just started playing Valheim, great game, I already love it. Especially the pixelated 3d artsyle
THE KING HAS RETURNED
How has no one said anything Mr hung about Zanny’s name being Jon😂
Looks im gonna say this now this game would sell/be played 100x more if it didn’t look like a PlayStation 2-3 game. I played it and its not bad but it just looks terrible. Its 2023 we have some of the most power consoles and pcs on the market games shouldn’t look like this anymore.
Semi-consistent upload schedule? Really? A man of your laziness?
Why did you use endgame gear throughout that whole fkn video it annoyed me so much lol
all zanny content gets an immediate like
HOLY WE GOT ANOTHER VIDEO
Haven't played it... Waiting for release
My first video watching Zanny was back on the Jedi fallen order series! Can’t wait to see him upload some of its content
"Farming really a man of your talents" zanny you have got to stop with the references, YOUR DOCTOR SAID IT WAS UNHEALTHY.
Hi Fi Rush video when?
how are you able to plant several crops in the same tile? don't they die if they're not in the correct biome?
i died of dysentery. Weird that I didn't go to valhalla, because i had a hell of a battle with the privy, i tell you what
fun fact: the same studio made goat simulator
Downloaded Valheim on my xbox, found out it didn’t support keyboard and mouse and then just deleted the game.  Pisses me off when game company’s that have already programmed kbm code can’t just move it over to xbox. Many games do it just fine.
More Valheim please. Love this game, and love your vids in this game.
Zanny is like a new Disney show or season every week or more a new episode comes out and it’s always good
What is that language Zanny is always speaking
Valheim is a great game! People try it now! 😭
ngl this nigga makes any game look fun, prolly convinced me to buy more games than the actual games' advertising lmao
If you ever feel like playing an RTS again, look up the awakening of the rebellion mod for empire at war. Could be fun the mod is cool, also there is a cool clone wars mod for the game too.
Valheim doesn't seem to be too bad of an afterlife. Far better than being eternally trapped in that one goddess' net, or fading to nothingness in the ginnungigap.
This is the best valhiem video ive ever seen
I have been waiting for thousands of years for another valheim to come out.... My travels didnt failed me
Finally, something good to watch as I eat
The Krennics grow in strength
Is this on pc or Xbox. I just bought it for Xbox. Are there servers? I have only played solo and it gets boring sometimes.
The game puts too much emphasis on temporary stats, it makes the game too slow.
Fun Fact; Coffe stain also makes an amazing factory builder called Satisfactory.
I personally have been building a black marble castle it took me like 5 weeks to get all of it tho
Posting Valheim videos, really, a man of your talents?
“A boss fight? Really? Man of your talents?” dying and dead
I'M STUCK STEP-ZANNY Can't stop laughing
Hollow knight in the future perhaps?
Already finish the game waiting for updates
The zan clan has become reality when the Mandalorian copied the content!
You fool. Minecraft legends is the only game for me
11:51 you're welcome
`finnaly
BEAR WITNESS, ZANNY VAILHEIM UPLOAD
Zanny please play banner lord 2
-Are you dramatically looking at the horizon again? -⛅🌊              🔭🗿?
Zanny "Femur Breaker" scream 4:41
The joke on the first 5 seconds never gets old damn
I would if I have anything besides my phone
hey you should try fallout 76 there is plenty of funny in that game.
Zanny i recommend you try and beat the game with campfires only
a zanny video about Valheim, im gonna cum
Who is jon
FFFIIINNAALLYY I HAVE MIRE VALHEIM FROM ZANNY
10/10 this game is like genshin impact but with the age of consent
Petition to have Danny create his own Norse saga series based on the company of Palheim’s exploits?
FourZanny will be an only fans for sure
Me and my 2 friends skipped classes just to play this game 4-9 hours straight everyday for 3 weeks
Finally a zanny video it's been ages
Day 48 of asking Zanny to play botw
Vr mod is fun
“ I’m hitting her soft bits from behind.”
Zanny maybe you go look for thor
bad video? no, bad you!
Valheim? Really? A man of your talents?
When’s the next destiny vid?
Dude, zoom out when you're sailing with your ship 😂
So hyped for Jedi survivor. I think while the animation threw me off at first I’ll grow to enjoy them
They also made gt3
I’m from Denmark and my first name is Thor this game was made for me
Looks like a blast. But, is it worth playing solo, or just in coop?
ROCK AND STONE!
Note: everyone don’t play valheim on Xbox it ass
Song at 14:05?
I'm a simple man. I see a new Zanny video, a neuron goes off
Valheim is Minecraft for men
When I saw that in the Mandalorian, that was my first thought.
I also started to play this game again recently, great minds think alike I suppose.
played this game from launch with a full server of friends.  i log in to do a new base build with each major DLC.  one of my favorite games ever.  really excited to relaunch another group server when they do the full release.  see yall in 2025 lmao.
I can't for the life of me convince my friends to play Valheim. It's a cool game and I've made a satisfying design of a hall meself but it really is better with company.
Me and my online group have been playing the hell out of this game it is sooo cool
Watch Zanny pull a deep rock
1 minute in. I'm convinced.
ZANNY AND VALHEIM IS AN ELITE COMBO
I really want to try this game, but hey, I don't wanna play it alone...
Wish my friends would play this with me so I could say “______? Really? A man of your talents?” Whenever they do anything
i dont understand why more people dont play this game
I’ve been playing this game since it came to Xbox and it is the best survival game I love it so much would highly recommended and it’s on game pass if you have that and it’s only 1.9 giga bytes on next gen
Just the first minute makes me wanna play again. If only I had fun friends haha
My headcannon is that Fnut and his Girlfriend went to the mistlands first as a vanguard, and when he came back he just brought the rest of his crew to fight the queen, but most of them died anyway because Fnut forgot to tell them about the seekers before they arrived at the new biome
Mistland is so op and annoying to traverses not gonna lie.
i mean thats cool and all but whats the modlist?
Zanny 3 soon to be dead channel
On this fine school night. Almost reaching 12, you have convinced me!
You should play Sea of Thieves 🏴‍☠
The main takeaway from this video is that Zannys name is actually Jon
super good game
*New Valheim vid* A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one
I was SO HYPED for Jedi Survivor, then it turned out it was only on new gen consoles. All I have is an Xbox 1 S, and my broke ahh cant pay for a series X. Fml.
Zanny you inspiring me to actually start streaming
your videos made me watch gameplay videos again, you are just top tier man!
Zanny you may not have heard of this game but I think you’d like it, it’s called Battlefront II
Hey zanny love your vids I kinda hope one day you will make a Ark video it would be cool
The montage at the beginning is a perfect representation of playing this game with friends lol😂
Hanoi Hannah vibes
I love how every zanny video seems to get better and better. Like in quality and presentation.
If zanny like valheim he'll probably love ark survival too
Oh good, he’s still alive 😂
I watched your previous Valheim videos before and I decided to download and play it immediately. Thank you for this video. I will share it to my friends in a valiant effort to pull them into the Valheim hole.
ZANNY!!!
Valhiem, A man of your talents? I honestly didn’t expect this though, love it
A Zanny video a day keeps the depression away.
I remember finding your first Valheim video which both helped me find your channel and discover Valheim. Even today, you're still one of my favorite youtubers, and Valheim is one of my favorite games :)
Thanks Phillipines for Zanny
In this episode of Palheim zanny and the boys go to th hive infested lands and die
Bruh the elden ring throwback made me spit my drink out. Like it's so perfect.
That positioning of the Dog feeder or Fountin is not the best choice below the cables sir zanny xddd
Zanny is Valheim on Xbox?
Does that last comment mean you going to make a jedi survivor series
Zany you should play 7 day to die
Ngl Zanny. But i'm so jealous of you right now. You get to play that game with friends. I wish I can do that
Did i hear a rock and stone ?
Can't wait for the new channel four zanny
The meme at the end is literally what I was thinking about as I watched that episode
Zanny's slow descent into madness has to be one of the most entertaining things to witness
Bro really made a 40 sek Timestamp for a game like Valheim before his friends died 900 times before the first boss (explaining it better than any explanaition could)😢
"Infested mine" they added DRG to Valheim
Narrating, really? A man of your talents?
Not even going to waste my time. This game is so cringe i can't even. The massive amounts of time it takes to do legit anything at all, just to die and lose it all is the opposite of fun. What even is this?? oh its a survival game, it requires endless side work to insulate yourself from dying to random bullshit without losing your ass in resources and gear.  I wish I had my 400+ hrs of my life back pre mistlands. The only reason why i spent so much time pre mistlands, was because mistands wasnt going to be fucked beyond.  How are even more flying bullshit that is impossible to kill fun? oh but its a survival game....  Devs, this game is wack. The people who do play it are too dumb to realize how much of a waste of time this pile of shit actually is.
Valheim content frequency needs to be upped, the steam charts got blown up from this game, and then nothing for so long :/ mistlands is still small compared to the other biomes we already have so I hope the ashlands is even better
Zanny's name is Jon??? I thought his name is some fuckboy name like Zachary or somethin
Zanny please play Skyrim
i fucking love your videos
only reason i dont play this more often is because i cant for the life of me figure out how people flatten the land properly lol. i feel completely braindead whenever i want to build things
You should play grounded
The funny dies as soon as his girlfriend opens her mouth. Not saying anything about her as a person, she's just not a good foil to Zanny's entertainment.
"Farming? Really?" "Its a peaceful life.".                  2 seconds later GO AWAYYYYY
John zanny
As soon as I saw the video I was already convinced
zanny may not be pregnant, but he never fails to deliver
“A new series on DRG.” Yeah. Said the liar
Miniguns and Starwars are always a sacrifice combination.
Hey zanny, if your into to torture yourself, play War Thunder 😂
Bookmark 05:30
did you beat lawrence?
Me and the boys waiting for Four Zanny
I want more tales of Fnut Snutsson
FINALLY THE VALHEIM TRILOGY
7:05 literally YES and i'm tired of pretending its not
I love this game so much but my friend group has shit taste in games and don’t have the attention span to collect resources but will grind days for a gun they will never use in destiny
That they play is a Mod, right?
I did play valheim, as did a ton of people. But then the devs thought it would be cute to announce to the world that they were taking a vacation immediately upon release when they suddenly had huge success and just abandoned development of the game for OVER A YEAR. So like most people, I stopped caring about the game.
Can we get a video that's just all puppy break please
Whyyyyyy. I’m getting déjà vu. I don’t know how to feel
i heard the DRG music at the end。so when the next DRG video
This just makes me sad because my friends stopped playing to instead play new stuff.
Good vid and I completely forgot zannys real name is Jon
are you going to play Minecraft Legends?
Valheim is perfect and if anyone says otherwise I will...
I just ate a really good sub while watching this.
finally ive been waiting for another valheim video and this didn't dissapoint
I mean I wouldn't mind playin it except I'm a broke teen with a ps2 as my console
It's always a good day when zanny uploads
I played this game once and thought it was 3d terraria, now i understand it’s 4d minecraft
Love the game …fuck the mist lands.
valeim is an amazing game but i do wish the dev team was faster/ bigger just so this game would be "finished" in a reasonable time
whens destiny 2 lighfall  vid
Zanny for the soldiers their thorax (their big butt) is a weak point. But they always keep you in front of them so fighting them by jumping up on a ledge and shooting them in the butt is safest since they can’t fly.
YOOOOOO MORE VALHEIM THIS GAME SLAPS
Best entertainment ever, thanks guys! 😂😂👏🎇
The most bloodcurdling scream 4:40
Zanny, I have to see you play ARK. It's the most addicting yet painful thing I've played. I need to see you play it.
We want DEEP ROCK you OGRE
Zanny: "Look, an oven!" Babe: "For what?" Zanny: "idk"  Classic Pinoy moment
bro you should play RE4 remake
For the San clan meme when I watched the Mandolorian I just heard it in my head
4:11 when you didn't have enough to pay the va
really a man of your talent?
I've been playing since it hit on Gamepass... Only problem is Ive had a world reset wipe all my progress and then after that I started getting crashes as it saved until the point it just corrupted my world save... I love the game so much but it kills me to lose my progress.
A timely Valheim video to coincide with the release of Seven Kings must die
Taking forever for new content Valhiem?? Really? A man of your talents?
if you wanted another game that captures the progression of Terraria, Valheim is for you. It doesn't have the ability to mine and build anything (you can defore the terrain a bit while mining and theres house building) but it has a very similar progression system.
Someone: "only two channels? Really? A man of your talents??"  Zanny: *creates three zanny*
I’ve been waiting for this for so long 🙏🏻
what is the music at 11:20
i cannot express how happy i am for a new video
Zanny - plays deep rock and talks it up Me - buys it immediately and really likes it Zanny - plays valheim and talks it up Me - “Well, here we go again”
Zanny really trying to avoid Lightfall 😂
It’s been so long since we got another Valhiem video lessggoooo
A valheim video, a surprise to be sure but a welcome one
One of my favorite series you’ve made. Super excited to see this stuff again.
The intro joke returns
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
this game isn't _better_ than Minecraft. It's like parallel to it. Once Valheim gets a metric fuckton of mods that completely change the game, then it will be better! It ain't a real game till I can force it to be Factorio with Elden Ring combat!
valheim looks fun, but do you know what's funner? deep rock galactic You need to make up for not having a drg video for so long.
very much enjoy
Yes Zanny, Valheim is better than Minecraft.
I would like to say, I sincerely appreciate your efforts to level your volume through the video. It's such a relief compared to every other YouTube channel lol, especially for those of us who don't wear headphones all the time
It's about time!
Really loved this game since the last time u posted the short series on it
Yes yes and yes
Zanny has convinced not in 17 minutes but in 17 seconds
Nice Radahn Story Reference 1:48
7:48 is so METAL I love it
need modlist so bad
Imagine being a lonely fisherman and one day you see a crew of Vikings sail by in a seemingly possessed vessel proclaiming "Schizo boat" in mild annoyance
I still remember the first time in the plain and in the Mistlands, Mistlands especially was terrifying af
good game to play with a large amount of friends, not a good game to invest in if youre just 2-3 and don't enjoy repetitive mindless walking/grinding
No need convince me pal, I've already beaten all there is to beat in Valheim. Grounded is way better though.
YES!!!!! The joke returns 0:00-0:05
Valheim is the most fun I've had playing with a group of friends in years. It's a remarkably funny and awesome game.
LOVE THE VALHEIM CONTENT
4:40 yup, that's zanny alright
the war thunder music went crazy hahahaha
It's hilarious in the Zanny lore that Huevos is now Hurvo because of Valheim
Please upload more of this so good bro
Ely reminds me of BMO
VALHIEM!!!!!
Let’s go Valheim Video 🎉🎉🎉
From the first few seconds I loved the call backs 😊
A Zanny video a day keeps the women away
no
Dying? really? a man of your talents?
Valheim, really? A man of your talents?
Wonderful little game, build a wonderful N shaped lighthouse
Glad you remembered this game. Not everyone does.:)
is fnut related in any way to cnut
Puppy break was adorable, made my night happier seeing them
Is anyone else surprised that Zanny’s real name isn’t zanny?
ROCK AND STONE
i'm waiting for next week and the return of our boi pervy the purge trooper
You should try don’t starve together.
Zanny? When did you get a new dawg??
Like boyfriend like girlfriend, she said gross to a coming joke zanny you should be proud
"There is no light attack". Word.
You convinced me at "farming?"
Zanny screaming with absolute panic when the troll appeared made me choke on my drink.
Thank you
Thank you zanny, I just started playing this with my mates. Valheim is such a banger game🙏
YESSSS MORE VALHEIM
If they put it on console I’m down.
Gotta get the boys to download this asap
Well this is a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one
I do love the ongoing "really? A man of your talents?" meme. It never gets old
I refuse
When d2
Took a few years
You tried Grounded?
I remwmbeey first time in the swamp. The cries of " climb the damn tree it cant hit is up here" and " its large amd slow just run through its damn legs to the safety of the dungeon" also " hay whats that's color behind me oh hell its a wraith"
FNUT SNUTSON   a fine Norse name
Wait was that a zanny name reveal?  Jon?
That Game remindes me of Conan Exiles, where can you Play it?
Yeah, i'll get to it eventually.
That Rouge One reference at the beginning was so great!
Poor poor choices of games the past few weeks
when ultrakill
Uploading? Really? A man of your talents?
What is this some discount Lidl wow 🥴🤣 I am never playing this shmuk 🤣
Since you finished all the classic souls games, I recommend Hollow Knight to add to the collection. Not necessarily as vids, but if you want to just try it out it’s not expensive and REALLY FUN. love your vids, keep it up zanman
Jon?
papa zanny gave us another banger🤣
YES VALHEIM YES
I agree mistlands is a lot of the worst aspects of Valheim. Fall damage, poison and fire, getting stuck on terrain, trees falling down cliffs, FOG.
actually bought the game because your other valhiem vids
Such a beautiful and peaceful game always makes my day better just like this video
The most strongest weapon is the camp fire.
Thank you Zanny. Viking sim wit da bois hit different.
Liking and Subscribing? Really? A man of your talents?
Challenge accepted….   Fuck, you sold me by 0:57
"What's the light attack look like?" "There is no light attack."
ZANNY you have legit become a religion to us stupid Americans.
Zanny convinced ne to download For Honor. How bad can it be?
Zanman and ZanKlan really are like a bunch of Viking: They come in and raid our boring lives. Unlike the real Vikings however, they leave the pillage of funnies and a good time behind
play spore you will hat and love it
11:21 that theme never gets boring
Providing us good content? Really? A man of your talents?
Attempt 17 at trying to get you to play HiFi Rush
jedi survivor comes out on my birthday lol
Valheim: Trash Without Friends
Yesss, more Valheim! I am happy it wasn't forgotten
Ah, 17 minutes of serotonin release. Thank you Zanny.
Zanny should play blade and sorcery
Yes zanny, more valheim thank you
been playing this a bunch with my friends ever since your first video on it :)
My main problem was the ore grind. Since they were so heavy, but made so little items and couldn't go through portals, getting them became a pain so everyone in my group got tired of it. The beginning was really fun though. As far as I know, some of the most popular mods for the game modify the ore limitations, since it's the biggest reason people stop playing and not being able to go through portals as ore, but being fine once made into something just seemed arbitrary.
I'm waiting for the return of Cockheim😂
4:38 that was a scream of pure fear lmao 😂😂
I did but all of my friends hated it so I was left to play it by myself and I had no idea how to continue after thr first boss besides go into the black forest
FINALLY
Zanny should play warframe
I love valhiem but I wish there was a smaller world option. Love the game but too much room to roam. I'm used to grounded with a manageable world size. Fun video
I like the game but I only got one freind that plays jt
Any game Zanny and the gang plays always make it look cool and fun....i need a pc
7:00 I agree. Fuck the block game
My god zanny another channel good luck
play viva piñata
I cannot believe that you didn't sing my "mother told me" while sailing. Not even once.
glad to see people still play thisn :D
Great game absolutely incredible game. Also that Zan Clan meme makes me like “shit I need deep rock”
A true hero for the people, warns of Mando spoilers.
There really is no more sword game
me watching zanny instead of doing home work 😏
It's an amazing game when you have friends, sadly they all left
Zanny explaining Viking lore to his gf
Did anyone else think Zanny said something else at first at 13:52? 🤨
Valheim is the fucking goat
zanny i will play valheim if you buy it for me
Mistlands is so unnecessarily hard even when you have the proper tier equipment, and the mist mechanic just isn't cool imo. I love valheim but the mistlands was just disappointing.
Fnut radahn intro was insane
15:39 the passion put into the screaming 👌(pause)
Nice meme
valheim is one of my favorite games! i spend so much time just designing a perfect house just to redo it when i unlock the next tier of materials. mistlands was truly a challenge i was not prepared for.
your third account should be ZannThree
When the world needed him most he returned
How often do you think someone gets their balls blown off in battle
I was absolutely in love with the game. But then I reached copper and absolutely lost all will to carry on. That grind is something else, and only gets worse in multiplayer. But I've only so much time and so many games to play.
Snut is actually the swedish slang for cop lol
I've been binge playing this game for weeks now. Since it came to gamepass. Funny to see this now.
Zanny doing his best David Attenbrough impression i see
* Reaches 11:30 in the video* Wait a minute I know that theme.
Can't believe Zannys girl name dropped some "Jon" nigga and he didn't notice
I would if it was on ps4, looks so good
Always look forward to a Zanny upload no matter the game
3 channels? Really racking in the money on this, huh? Still though, can't blame him
Yooo the radahn intro
Yo
Are you playing on the game preview on Xbox?
It’s a little too late for valheim I think
Poor huevos, that one twice chatter ruined his name two years ago
Zanny is called Jon confirmed
Sub hour view let's goooooo
Zan Man you are the goat I needed this
Waiting for the Ps4 release...
Bro first time I played Valheim was the demo version on console, never in my life have I been more scared of death by wild boar. Couldn’t build anything either. 10/10 great game please don’t cancel me.
This game had me so addicted i had to drop out
just started up a new playthrough about 1 week ago....im in the mountains already and went from 135 hours played to 177....this video is about make that 200
Bruh that radan introduction...
4:34 I can’t believe I’m this petty but they actually aren’t made by the same studio, originally there was all just Coffee Stain but then they started branching out cause taxes vs. expansion and now we have this mess  Here’s a link too a cool video on it  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CilfQ1FeVg  Edit: fuck he said publisher not studio 💀
I would really like to see you and the boys play sea of thieves
That one about the mandalorian is so true!!!!
Which do you prefer subnautica or valheim?
I instantly thought the same as I saw the scene in  the mandalorian
not green spiderman video that I wanted, but we cope with other really good videos.
I have to thank you Zan Man.   Because of your videos, I have been enjoying Valheim so much! I will never touch StarDew Valley again because Valheim is THE BEST!! ❤️❤️
Skyrim next? Hum ?
Fighting? Really? A man of your talents?
YK it's a good vid when Odur's theme plays
Lightfall video when?
2. Video asking for a Destiny Lightfall
Unequips armor and porcupine but keeps the shield and bow. What a scrub
I have missed palheim (Did I hear a mention on Jedi survivor?)
This will sound weird but I swear I was thinking about this game a week ago and I remember you played it and I thought to send money to tell you to play it again but here you are doing it. What a meme
I played this game on release with my buddy years ago, it was really fun until we discovered it wasn't finished outside of the basics. All I remember is sailing was really cosy, especially with the music.
One of the best survival games out there
That's what I do😂       It never works...
Try to play project zombies you maybe you will like it
That GRG meme at the end made me actually like that Mandalorian scene now
zanny shittalking brazil being philipino :tf:
I was almost not convinced. The last 32 seconds you didn't disclose in the title got me there. Thank you for lying to me!
SLIPKNOT
I crave mineral and deep rock
Me trying to convince Zanny to play Star Wars: Jedi Survivor when it comes out
Huh, deja vu...  Relating to Radahn Also bro became Let Me Solo Her
I have no enemies
im gonna keep trying... ZANNY PLAY A WAY OUT
Already played it
Anyone know the music he used in the video? The one where it sounds like it’s out of Bloodborne
4:40 JESUS THAT SCARED ME
You do know that "Kattegat" means "cat's ass" in dutch right?
Zanny, Jedi Survivor is coming out next week. Its time to return to Star Wars, you keep referencing it anyways. It is your destiny
If a clan system every finds it's way into valheim either through mods or the devs. Tru Viking Chaos can begin. Racing against clans to see who can finish the bosses firsts. Raids others clans for reasources. Blowing warhorns in the distance as a fleet emerges from the fog. That might just hook some newcomers to the game.
If I ever get dogs I’m going to name the after miro and kirin
I've been watching u for a little while now, and you've become one of my favorite youtubers in what seems like the blink of an eye. Your content is amazing; it's creative, witty, and charming, and it makes people feel good. I decided to look you up on twitch and to my delight you stream Fifa as well as all the other games you play. It was incredible seeing this overlap that I have wanted for over a year but didn't know existed. You've made my week, and it's only Monday :)
Yep I’m convinced
where is ds3
I swear that meme at the end was all I would think of during that scene in the Mandalorian.
this entire update was just meant to make fun of the british. i mean, those bugs looked like they had some familiar teeth, and the queen died in the end, so should we rename it Valheim; Kill the Natives?
15:29 Everyone else: "Did the Queen fall?" "She just disappeared." "We probably have to find her." Fnut: Looks behind him to see the menacing silhouette of the Queen, "AAAAAAAHHHH!!! FOUND HER!!!"
We got our Valheim server back then in Citadel Servers. Good ol days!
Zanny have u played smite before ?
Spoken like true destiny players 6:33 15:00
"something about holding a minigun makes you need to sacrifice yourself"  As a halo reach player, yes. Yes it does. And it's fucking glorious.
the most cinematic viking movie
Guys who wants zanny to play poppy playtime ? Or even project playtime? It would be so cool
Try terraria
Never thought id see 1nother video on this beautiful game
Zanny will come back to destiny... They ALWAYS come back...
Really, Valheim?  A man of your talents?
Me and my friend tried this game like 3 days ago and it was the most funniest s@#-t I have played
I liked the mistlands but to each their own
bro is like 0.2% of becoming amaran for the titanfall 2 sale lol
Week and some change 70 of telling Zanny to join the viking faction in For Honor
1:05 after that mutch i'm gota Say You won of a bitch i'm in
Beating Moder on 10fps on the Xbox one was one of the greatest moments of my life.
bro now i'm scared
I did a happy dance whe I saw zanny upload more valheim
I bet ud like grounded
I’d love to play it. I was hype as hell for it. It finally comes to game pass and… saves get corrupted non stop on XSX. Every time you load you’re set back to day 1. Some people have gotten lucky where that doesn’t happen. I am not one of those few people.
now this is a video worth watching
do a flipp (with rizz)
A man of your talents?
I don't know about you guys but when me and my friend fought The Queen it took over half an hour, and within that time she escaped the boss room and proceeded to destroy the whole outer fortress
Dude I can imagine playing this game with my Brothers of Metal playlist on loop lol
Valheim? In 2023? This guy knows exactly what I want and it’s scary.
Love this game,hours of fun for such little disk space
4:41 the moment when fnut the son of snut be comes fnut the daughter of snut
No poison swamp so it must be mid
I stopped playing when the grind wall for building a decent end game home started.
No way, Zanny uploaded 2 videos in 2 weeks. Can we keep this Zanny?
Valheim? Really? A man of your talents?
"better than minecraft" Valheim is just minecraft x terraria if every developer had a beard
This is 17 minutes of you trying to convince us to get friends
Playing valheim? A man of your talents?
Dropped by just to bump the DS3 playthrough - hoping for an update soon
Already starting the video with a callback
There is a cool mod called Krumpac you should try it
“Guide our journey Odin “ Odin : NAH
One zanny, too Danny, three zanny, blue zanny

raggin on my nar til i olf
Hot tub with the brooooss

Checking the comments. Really, a man of your talents?
Don't worry, I was already convinced negative a year ago
Pee pee poo poo
17 minutes but in reality 78 hours of game time spent 😂
4:42
“And what was your father’s father’s name?” “Smut”
0:00 I’m pretty sure this bit has been done by you before. I mean really? Recycling bits? A man of your talents?
please, more Valheim. i was so happy to see this video show up in my feed
Zanny You should try project zomboid
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH BONES?
Can’t lie Valheim looks like a really bad game   Said the liar
I took so long to complete building my house my friends stopped playing. Made a cool tar roof, but the server was abandoned before I made it to the mistlands. Gotta wait for next update  😂
The return of the king
I am once again asking Zanny to play Yakuza 0
No, I don’t want to play Valheim
0:29 as an Englishman I can confirm this is England
God way to make me feel old I forgot this series is like 2 years old
THE SEQUEL IS HERE
Again trying to get zanny to play mrtal gear rising
I really want to get back into Valheim. But to just casually play took a lot of effort, both in game and out. In game, the four of us friends who started this world hit the mountain biome and the resource grind took a major leap and the 3 of them lost interest. Outside the game, I didn't have the memes to host a server none of us did. So I paid for the upkeep for a private server from one of those hosting sites. The constant updates tooooo, I don't remember the name of it, but the big modding tool for valheim i used to try and streamline some of the process to make hosting a server easier was also a challenge. (I hated how any wood that didn't have a roof became that awful green, so I turned that off immediately. Did they make a way to stop that in the vanilla game itself?)   This was during the early release of Valheim when the hype was immense. I honestly would love any excuse to drag friends back into that world. Building our village is a fond memory.
Yo he still playing! Let’s go!
Jeez. Need some building guides for this game. You guys made your bases look amazing
This is all a delusion, he's still deciding whether to kill Jin's Uncle or not.
Zanny should do a one off video returning to elden ring but with mods like seem less co-op
goog
Zan man I NEED MORE DEEP ROCK GUNNER VIDS
When are you going to stream?
Yooo Zanny back on valheim
Wasn't there a final boss in this after you get all of the monsters heads? Wait theres a altar somewhere where you summon it.
The segments of wholesome content Zanny has with his gf never fail to make me smile 👍
Palheim hath return
I am so excited for jedi survivor
ITS BACKKKKKK!!!!
If Fnut's father is Snut, that'd make his full name be Fnut Snutson.
As much as he might deny it , zanny will drop the lightfall vid
i would love to see zanny try GTFO or Rain world! great vid
Im soloing mistlands so is nice to see at least someone has friends.
Zanny’s videos are like drugs, once you watch a video you’re always hooked
I remember when sir zanny first played valheim, time flys by so fast
Ok Zanny. You convinced me.
The return of the "a man of your talents" gag made me inordinately happy XD
The scene of the Hot tube instantly convinced me
LETS GOOOOOOOOOO VALHEIM CONTENT
I love the nod to norse kings with fnut not cnut
OH MY GOD thank you zanny for not spoiling the mandalorian
Danny play sea of thieves
The funnies where good
i lov valheim
"Safest Brazilian area" proceeds to show Brazil 2 (the first is Blighttown)
Nah I'm gonna go play Farcry 5.
Great video on an underrated game.     So when the next destiny video
Thank you zanny for giving me a little joy in my life
Are you gonna play The new star wars survivor?
Maybe the best zanny video I've watched
Seeker I barely know her.😁
No i don't i Will
I started playing Valheim a couple weeks ago. It’s been fantastic. This only reinforces my thoughts on the game more
I would be hyped for Jedi survivor except I can’t play it. 😂
Id play more, but after one of the Dev's told me my opinion as a player does not matter (after saying the ballista's targeting you makes no sense) I've had a hard time looking at the game
Loving the game. Just beat Moder.
Zannyheim
You monster, I saw the thumbnail and thought this was a deep rock video. Curse you zanny!!! (Still a great video, you never disappoint!)
Oh yeah, can't wait for the Jedi Survivor videos -- that's a game you NEED to play full through!
Is this palhiem?
BRUH THE MEME AT THE END I WAS THINKING EXACTLY THAT WHEN I SAW THE SCENE SO I COULDN’T TAKE IT SERIOUSLY
I've been playing tribes of midgard it's got a knock off mode of this game lol
Viking Soulslike Minecraft goes crazy
Jon?
Yo hear me out grounded
Zany please shout me out I love your vids man
That radhan intro got me invested
Valheim, the village of Zanheim.
“Breathing, really? A man of you’re talents?”😂
Fnut's father's name when translated means cop. Funny coincidence.
Holding a 2 year old running gag? Really? A man of your talents?
Did you know that coffee stain also developed goat simulator
You need to play a Yakuza game there so good
Valheim, really? A man of your talents?
I wish Zanny does voice acting because he has a talent, but if he does get a voice acting job then we won’t have any more YouTube videos.
This was one of the highest quality vids man top shit
DID I HEAR A ROCK AND STONE?!
I want it but i don't have the money
When is the next deep rock video
2:36 and he sacrifices THE ROOOOOOOK
In a bind? Take them from behind! - Sun Zoo

very cool game. just don’t get enough attention sadly. or did it? this title tries to tell us otherwise
After a stressful day at work, Zanny always makes things better
Really wish they would add keep inventory as an option
Your playing on Xbox and it's only just released for Xbox how have you been waiting for content lol
You better tame 3 Wolfs in Valheim and name them after yours next video Zanny
I’ve finally got Valheim now that it’s on Xbox. I just don’t have friends haha
There should be a fourthZanny Channel for Dog Content only. please
Left out the part where the map is procedurally generated, so everyones off on there unique adventure
I was literally thinking it's about time for a new Zanny video
A surprise valheim video?
Now you have to find a Name for the drip contest in Valheim
As a Brazilian myself, I can confirm that our most peaceful tourist areas are monster-infested fog fields.
i actually started playing valheim after watching your first video from two yrs ago.
Try Outward out Zanny!
plz more valheim
10:52 W rizz Zanny
I think that yes I prefer this game over Minecraft but only base game. Modded Minecraft is much better and a blast.
Recommending a game? Really? A man of your talents?
Zanny is the only YouTuber that can make me watch games I have no interest in!
I own Valheim, but my friends dont so i've never launched it hoping they deicide to randomly take intrest.
Could you please have a go at sea of thieves it is a pirate game where you can mess around with your friends on an awesome pirate landscape
I'm just commenting to help the zan man
Anyone else hoping Zanny will play Skyrim soon?
4:26 see it is deep rock reference therefore no need for a new deep rock vid😂
I wish I can clone 7 Zannys so there’ll be new videos every day of the week
i love this game and i got my friend to get the game how can i convince him to keep playing (without holding his family hostage)
Zanny playing Valheim in 2023? Let's fucking goooooooooo!
Zanny should play modded battlefront 2 on his pc like if you agree
MASTERPIECE
Gimme Gimme Gimme MORE
In the first two seconds of the video I thought valleheim was a farming simulator
Valheim is fun, its just a lot of farming
"My name is Fnut. Son of Snut. Grandson of Knut. Father of Nut." -Zanny's Viking, probably
His videos are amazing. Always a pleasant surprise when I see it in my notifications.
I haven't played Valheim post mistlands, but this has indeed convinced me to pick it up again.
Playing valhiem? Really? A man of your talents?
a comment from me trying to convince you to play mount and blade
Ive been waiting for this moment all my life…
Zanny upload more Destiny
Jokes on you Zanny I started playing YESTERDAY
You don't need to convince me.. I really hope valheim is going to be on consoles someday
Ngl, when I saw Jack Sparrow in the thumbnail, I thought he was playing Sea of Thieves.
Yes more valheim
3:42 "snut" is swedish slang for a cop lol
Another Valheim vid is an unexpected occurrence, but a welcome one for sure!
I present to you, Muck!
Honestly I needed this, I tried to start but something immediately bothered about the game. Now I’m willing to give it a better chance!
I love how they’re like, “Greetings!” And then immediately cuts to a boss fight 😂
Should make a channel with streams
FINALLY🎉🎉🎉🎉
lets fucking go Zanny I have also been addicted for the last 2 months
Is this on console?
Hey Zanny, if you are seeing this, just a reminder that the sequel to Jedi Fallen order comes out on ten days.
My brother has Valheim on his Xbox series x. HOWEVER, he gets home from work when I get home from school, and goes right on it to play, you guessed it, Valheim
Really? Valheim? a man of your talents?
Looks really fun, its sad that i dont have any friends to play with so im gonna go sleep in the road tonight
Best 17 minutes of my life

Amazing.

Big fan of your content Zanny. Really want to see you play sea of thieves and Metro 1 and 2.

Just because you're such a good youtuber I'm gonna play it❤❤
AT LAST!!!! My wish has come true, it has been too long.

I was convinced as soon as I read 17 minutes of me trying to convince you
Zanny always releases great content!       BUT WHERES THE BATTLEFRONT TWO YOU LITLE SHI-
i’ve played nothing but Valheim for the past month, and I haven’t even got bored once like i’m genuinely impressed by how amazing this game is
“Farming really? a man of your talents” *Instant Like*
