Zane is so sycophantic
I love you, Alex.
Strange guy
There’s something cringe, egotistical & disingenuous about Zane Lowe.
Words cannot describe how much I love this band.
No way Zane thinks Mirror is Alex best.
I have a feeling xqc and Alex Turner will be great friends
Why does he stutter so much?
I asked ai to explain alexes sentences and it works
honestly you can see the difference between old alex n this alex, even tho both have trouble finishing sentences you can see alex is more aware of what hes talking about here, i love that hes embracing maturity as he grows but i still love the old him that was fully unaware most of the time
5:30
A true artist who is more comfortable to express himself through his art. Thats the key behind the magic The band create
The man can write complex songs but can't deliver one simple sentence out of his mouth 😂🤣
التسريبات يلي عم ينزلها matt على حسابو على انستا عم تعطيني أمل بألبوم جديد يا رب يكون ألبوم ل AM 🙏🏻
I first thought this guy was in prison suit being interviewed whilst incarcerated
I could watch alex turner interviews all day
Does anyone feel like Zane just says whatever the guest need to hear to get in their inner circle. I never feel he’s genuine
I think alex might be autistic. He's always got a mask on, struggles to formulate sentences quickly and he seems to have a few other traits. Obviously im no psychiatrist but i am autistic myself and even if he's not, i can relate to his experiences he seems to express, sometimes being loneliness or sadness which autistic people often feel as we dont quite fit in. I do think its shallow how people think hes always high; he might just be misunderstood and people dont seem to take what he says seriously. What do you think? I love AM and all their albums ❤️ This interview is great too!
Respect to Zane for keeping a coherent conversation with Alex for longer than 30 minutes 🙏
so many comments about him not speaking well or sounding incoherent. i must be missing something. almost everything he says here makes sense and is well-put
struggling to hide his Sheffield accent
there are not enough words for how much I love this interview
Watching him try to speak in full sentences is somehow evidence of how beautifully artistic and imaginative his mind is
i cant stand this guy zane, I feel that all the time he wants to attract too much attention and be the star of the show, instead of giving room for the guest artist to speak and express himself.
his voice cracks are so goofy
I've never been able to make sense of this fella  on every interview he's done  but his music is just class
He looks a bit like Jake Gyllenhaal here
why the comments are so mean with alex 😭
I love him
This man is exhausted! He just needs sleep
If you look up the word sycophant in the dictionary it just say's Zane Lowe.
How is he telling Alex what is and what isn’t about his own songs 🥴
Has someone dubbed over Alex's voice?
1.5 speed and it's the best interview !
Is Zane a fan? He should make that clear.
Why does he speak so weirdly like he's having a strokr
Pienso que es un esfuerzo hacer entrevistas pero aqui lo vi relajado
Alex es una persona timida con vinculos  cercanos referentes a lo que el.le gusta hacer vive para eso ...por.eso pienso es asi ....disfruta mucho lo.que hace y su mente siemore esta ocupada ...
❤
I’m listening to this right now because I am having a bad derealization episode and this is one of the only things that can help me
as Im watching this I realise how low Alex's normal voice is compared to how high some of the nites he hit are In the car album
I JUST discovered AM. Ang holy s. They are mind-blowing. Absolutely mind-blowing. Before, i knew only name of band. Now i am fully invested.
Zane Lowes arse creeping is just so cringe. I cant watch
Alex Voice.....>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Zane lowe always butts in whoever he interviews
He does not enjoy talking about his art and I’m here for him
Zane to Alex talking ratio is way too high here... He could've asked less winding questions
Crazy how big the Arctic Monkeys are and they stay so hidden, amazing group of artists!
Let’s be honest Turner could have called the album shit sandwich and Zane would think it high art. Zane’s interview style is horribly sycophantic.
The way he speaks in interviews is such a mood and it’s another reason I love him
Alex is just like me fr fr, he's an introvert, he can't put together a coherent sentence and is always forgetting words when talking to other people
Man he is so on around 9:00 with tempo and pace. Geniussssses
huge fan but why does he talk like he's always holding in a burp
Haven't paid attention to the Arctic Monkeys since like 2013. Did Alex hit puberty in the last ten years? Wasn't expecting such a deep voice. I certainly don't remember it being like that.
Alex’s the last rock star. Doesn’t even have any social media. Lives his life. Writes his songs. Does his art.
26:34
no te entiendo nada pero te amo miamor
Does anyone have the clip of Alex playing Hello You in Mexico in 2019 that they mentioned here?
Zane is the best person to interview complex musicians and make them feel comfortable and confident.
I can't get over how good his hair is
I cant believe its been a year. time flies. best wished to them and i hope they have a great break and fun making a new album for us.
HIS DEEP VOICE DADDY-
sometimes i don't understand wet he's talking about but i can listen to him talk forever
Interviews where the interviewer is a super fan and cheerleader instead of a journalist are a missed opportunity IMO. There lots of questions long term fabs would want asked, some of them aren't they kind of fawning things zane lowe wants to ask though
Zane: it's more than that right?? Alex: yeah i mean it's a car
1:40
I see Alex saves all of his verbal communication skills and energy for his singing
Sexiest man ever
oh yes totally 34:15
Zane is a bit of a know all and doesn’t give people the chance to speak? I’m not sure if this is the case but seems possible?
His voice now is so deep 😭I just remebered him as a innocent guy with cool personality and now his the cool man that isn't that innocent 😭😭😭😭
lil sas?
What's with the David Hasselhoff look? Alex has turned into a member of Baywatch with that barnet.
It was probably a struggle pulling Zane out of Alex's a** after the interview.
They said there was no "end of gig kinda song" on the Car, but having seen Body Paint live I can disagree! Such a banger
his voice is deeper than i though
I hate their last album will be released in February 2024
this has got to be the most comfortable I have ever seen Alex in an interview!! Props to Zane
Some people are better expressing themselves on paper - Alex Turner isn’t the most eloquent speaker but I think his songwriting is hugely original, witty and thought-provoking. My favourite line is ‘run with scissors through a chip pan fire fight’. Fabulous!
Cool to have seen how they've both grown up and grown in their careers since Arctic Monkey's early days.
Oh Alexander, you're one of a kind.
I’ve watched this interview numerous times from start to finish and I love how Zane Lowe is so in tune with Alex’s body language. Alex starts off tense and as the interview progresses you can see his shoulders drop and his hands become more free as Zane helps him loosen up. It’s refreshing.
505k vues and there was 707 comments 💗
I don't know if people realize but Zane is literally thanked in the album notes of their debut album, he's literally been a fan and friend of these guy's since the beginning
what is everybody on about, his voice is deeper but he still sounds and speaks like a northerner x
I dont wanna hear that anymore.
This interview makes me so happy
Big fan here, but i don't find anything special about his lyrics objectively speaking
so this is how I look like as an introvert , very embarrassed in a social situation, pretending to look normal 🥹
the way he tends to put his hand on his shoulder underneath the jacket is what I do so very often
Me estaba sintiendo ansiosa por otras cosas, vi esta entrevista y me relajé tanto, graciias Alex, haces mis dias mas tranquilos y felices <3
Little posh boy now isn't he
Genuine
❤😢😢 hugs ❤
What's the name of this guy from top gear? He looks like a younger version of him
Body paint is the closer. It’s epic
No toilet paper needed when Zane's about.
Seems like a lovely fella and was actually surprised after watching their Glastonbury performance that he hasn't actually lost his Sheffield accent.I don't know why he doesn't just go onstage as himself rather than the crooning 70s lounge act persona, he's way cooler here
They're amazing live....but They've really become quite arrogant in the fact that they wont play their most popular songs because "they dont just wanna give people what they want" Guys....we buy the tickets
Alex is a genius ! What a talented songwriter & musician!❤
To tally agree.with a comment above that Alex has the most beautiful ' soothing, soulful speaking voice . Can understand why his singing voice has such a melodic tone . Alex is simply... GORGEOUS ! ❤❤❤
Wow Alex actually sounds like he’s from Sheffield still here
I Iove the Arctic Monkeys but The Car ain’t it…
his voice is smooth AF JEEEEESH!!!
It's quite funny watching Zane speaking really fast and getting as much words out as possible and then Alex taking 2 minutes trying to make his thoughts into words haha
Just sit on the chair you attention seeking oddball
The Car is the best album development of the band! They develop and mature with every album! So grateful of the pace they are taking. When you love a band/artist you got to trust their process and respect it ❤
There is an idea of a Zane Lowe. Some kind of abstraction. But there is no music fan. Only a journalist. Something illusory. And though he can hide his cold gaze, and he can shake the artist's hand and feel flesh gripping theirs, and maybe  even sense their music tastes are probably comparable, he simply does not have one.
Mr Schwartz is next level.
The Car is literally a masterpiece, what a moment to be alive and be able to listen to it. Thanks AM, thanks Alex
Alex is so scatterbrained and incoherent but I could spend forever listening to him. His expressions, mannerisms, nervous energy, timidness… I am as enchanted by him now as I was 18 years ago.
became an arctic monkeys fan a couple of years ago and then more so when louis tomlinson introduced me to them and honestly this man is such a tallent
He is so adorably awkward
this interview really got to me 🥰
Listening to Zane Lowe’s relentless fawning and pseudo-intellectual babble, I am just waiting for the point where Alex Turner gets in touch with his inner Sheffielder and says, “Stop rattlin’ like a can ‘o mabs you pretentious pranny!”.
I just don't like Zane Lowe. Never did from when he was on MTV.  He's a brown nosing phoney.
Funny how critics can define music from actual artists..
QUEEN, THE WHO, ROLLING STONES. MY FAVOURITE BANDS BUT ARCTIC MONKEYS IS UP THERE AS MY FAVOURITE, ABSOLUTLY AMAZING. CARROW ROAD WAS SO GOOD!
Can someone explain what Alex was referring to as Jamie decision around 22:00? Was it about playing thwir demos foe the fams at concerts?
Scrolling through the comments trying to find someone who found the link to a video of Alex going broadway during from the ritz to the rubble
Someone would have a billion subs if they just had a channel where they edited out Zane and just had the artists speak
As a fan? More like as a fanny!
Drugs
As much as their first two albums are similar I’d say they’re also different: the first is garage rock and the second is post punk revival with some heavy Black Sabbath influences.
I love the little smile and relief when Alex said "Finally" at 27:13 because Zane understood the reason behind the title of the album, I love it <3 Thank you Zane for another amazing interview!
Alex talks as if he isn’t english and doesn’t quite know the english words to what he wants to say 😭 so me
I cant believe i saw this Man live a couple days ago. Im litearlly shocked. Like how is it real. I love ihm sm bro
They're almost 40 years aged.  The youthfulness and pop rock era of the Monkeys is gone mates.  Welcome to the David Bowie era.
11:03
I saw them yesterday im still recovering 😅😊
What did he said at 0.27-0.32 😭😭
There's a similar pattern between the Monkeys' progression and the Beatles. From kind of doing a lot of stuff in a rehearsal style to becoming more and more experimental in the studio. I think it shows great maturity in sound. Excited to see where they go next
Bad Kiwi.
Alex'in hiç ama hiç değişmemesi!😎
Альбом прочищение организма..  Очень упрямій и заядлій. Затрагивает низменніе потребности, ценности, состовляющие, ощущения и пороки..  А про остальное умалкивает - єто ві должні найти в себе сами..
Альбом прочищение организма..  Очень упрямій и заядлій. Затрагивает низменній ощущения и пороки..  А про остальное умалкивает - єто ві должні найти в себе сами..
По сути єто второй альбом - как он єто пітается обїяснить..
DADDY SORRY DADDY SORRY
I subscribed as well for the reason you stated that other people do. Totally, fair and honest without being dramatic and trying to take someone down which this space is littered with. Thank you
hes so fuckcign hot pleasee alex gjve me a chance
In that same token anyone can date FAKE me then sue FAKE me all over my head! Whose gonna be the next gold digger? That was the plan all along.
I’ve watched this interview a disgusting amount of times lol
What a fantastic interview! Zane asks the questions we all want the answers to!
He seems more sober
Gokil bang
I'm pretty sure this is a goodbye album. Solo career is ideal at this point.
ngl this alex is strung out af
Alex Turner is outta this world, both as a man and as a songwriter. There is smth about him that cannot be grasped. Very unique. Very genuine.
Red car hugged me once. I sat for minutes staring in the distance feeling guilt.cause the last person to hug me was plural. Nothing more. Tried to hug ne again but I recoiled. But I owe no one my loyalty. Tell me. Does my back bleed gold?
Is it just me or this interviewer should be replaced? It's time to give others the opportunity to talk with artists. I also didn't like how he was talking to mac miller (my favourite artist) it was very shallow and he is just talking nonsense. Just my personal opinion
As a songwriter Alex is extremely underrated because he's not following any current trend. He is simply a musician and a music fan. I think he deserves an even bigger audience.
Top album gli ultimi due !!❤🎉🎉🎉
Zane's just terrific. He interviews people like they're his friends (many of them actually are) and it gives the interview this lovely laid back energy. People like Alex and Them Yorke open up to him because even though they're not too keen on doing press, as least they know what they're getting with Zane.
I never noticed he stutters. As someone with a stutter similar to his I wouldn’t be able to stop smiling if i ever got to talk with him. Would be my no 1 choice of celebrity to bump into in public. 100%
Whatever People Say...was a revelation. I instantly fell in love with that album and people could not understand what I was listening to. It has been a long interesting road with AM since then. They have the courage to switch it up, and I applaud that.  Alex is the most modestly awkward person...I love it.
Does zane ever not like anything new
im just in love with his voice in this interview🫶
I'm annoyed how arctic monkeys has gone since I love there early work but obviously the band are completely different people they don't even sound British anymore which is strange
He’s so beautiful. So healthy, Alex makes me so happy.
he looks like zayn m
I think Alex should start doing asmr
i need the green jacket
Annie Mac and Zane Lowe are the two interviewers who seem to 'get' Alex by not droning on asking him what the songs are about, more about the dynamics of writing and letting him get his train of thought (excuse the pun)
"nice one"
i love the fact that he's so akward
Hope he is ok.. seems like hitting a bit too many drugs? Apparently he has always been like that?
Is that you, Richard "The Hamster" Hammond?
Word has it Zane is still going without pause...
I'm relatively new to AM. I've only been listening to them since about the end of 2018. How they never got on my radar is beyond me. I am now a HUGE fan of theirs. I mean.... I've POURED over their albums, obsessively. I've come away with two things: 1. Alex Turner is a ROCK STAR in the true sense of the word. Almost  a throwback to the great wave of British bands of the late 60's and 70's. Amazing vocalist, stage presence and he has a keen sense for a musical hook. 2. He is easily on of the best songwriters and lyrisist of his generation of musicians. I can't think of anyone that paints a more vivid picture in his writing or understands the power  a poetic metaphor more than him. Even his side projects are amazing. One of my all time favorite songs is " My Mistakes Were Made For You". That song just fires on all cylinders. Absolute genius songwriting.
He looks like skinny Hugh jackman
A couple times Alex seems close to providing a real answer to a question and the interviewer interrupts. A little annoying
alex is so beautiful
They highlight each individual sound in the most profound way, better than any band ever has. My favorite music, always will be.
Oh gosh His voice 😍 I could listen to him for Hoooouuurrs ....charming
His voice, his look....so handsome....🫠
26:52....  he is so pretentious
I am literally in love with Alex Turner like I cannot describe him and I’m so glad I grew up listening to him from like middle school until now
Talk in ur normal accent Alex stop trying to put some bs stuck up voice on
I don't understand what they are even talking abt tbh bc of how alex responds so randomly lmao
I just love how Zane seems to make anyone feel comfortable. His interviews feels like he’s just chatting with his friends
Worst album ever
We mf love arctic monkeys       (most of it is mainly alex)
I appreciate Zane Lowe, he asks such elaborate but also open-ended questions that show how much he knows - and cares - about the musician and the music itself. No nonsense, no generic stuff. I'm so glad I got to hear Alex's thoughts and processes. The Car is such a strong album, it blows my mind.
New song title for Alex:  Focusing Isn't Everything.  😉   "The Car" is a fantastic album.
He's so fine
35:05 think Alex just saw a ghost
CADE A CIFRA DE THE ARCTIC MONKEYS, QUE DESORGULHO DOS FAS, ECA
He’s back! He’s back with his english accent 😭😭😭
Wish the interviewer would have let Alex talk instead of himself.
His skin is glowing
I just got into their music 2 years ago! (I was too dumb to get the music before) Now alongside Lana Del Rey, The Weeknd and Taylor Swift, it's my favourite band. Their last 2 albums feel like Folklore and Evermore from Taylor Swift. There are some songs that are good, but it's an experience that you don't get from quickly putting on a song when you want a tune. I'll see them perform this summer!!
I love this man so much.
does anyone know the footage Alex is talking about in mexico?
He is as socially awkward as I am 😭😂
Alex Turner is still looking fit 😍 Every 00s Indie girl (Like me) crush... still stealing our hearts lol
Is it just me or does Alex look like a cross between a young Pacino and a young Robert Carlyle?
anybody else unable to stay awake on last 2 AM albums since Alex Turner got a piano. Still love the the early records, and don't know who all those ramdom dudes they have on stage for concerts now. Like 4 Cool Lads from Shefield. Not a bunch of weirdos like Radiohead or Arcade Fire.
Lost their crown to the 1975. God this guy is dull.
I think arctic monkeys have probably changed more than any other band in history
I think When Zayn talks Zayn has almost the voice of Alex🤔
Me encanta la atmósfera que este tipo crea con los músicxs. Igual no dejo de pensar que la titularon como una entrevista a los "arctic monkeys" y solo está Alex
Zane does too many mans and dudes but Alex is just so brilliant and genuine he saves Zane from looking a complete prat.
23:00 😭😭
I got to disagree. I think you can draw a line between all of the records. Not necessarily with the sound but as musicians and songwriters and how they tell stories. Each album like a new book in the series of novels.
I saw their concert last Saturday in São Paulo, Brazil, because they are my son´s favorite band. And I felt in love with their music!
Arctic Monkeys inspire you to pick up a pen and write
Zane is overly obsequious, it puts me off watching these interviews.
Body paint is 🥰
Alex looks emaciated.
Mirrorball song hit me since first time I heard it . This Alex singer is just soooooo amazing who can sing like this nowadays?! He is like my personal Barry White! Wow
it’s cool how you internalize different parts of the interview as you rewatch it, kind of like a movie. i love how interesting people can get
He does the lower octave intro to Ritz in their performance at Primavera 2022.
I love this album. And to me, the sound is reminiscent of the sound he created with The Last Shadow Puppets.
It’s a shame to see what selling out did to zane. I miss the rebel version from early 00’s
I didn't know Spiderman made music.
You know that one off ‘the Office’ movie David Brent where he has a dream of going off forming a band touring the country and funding it all from his own pocket while the other band mates just follow his lead does what he says gets paid and just goes home at the end the night…. yeah I kind of feel that’s where Arctic Monkeys are now lol do the other band mates have a voice in things? there is no doubt whatsoever that Alex Turner is a phenomenally skilled musician but really the music is just so underwhelming
my Mann
each to their own but for me the last two albums are so dull.
I'm sure I'll get crucified here but sometimes.... Zane is a little much for me. And gets really pretentious at times. "The Car is the best album title of the year.... its SO emotive..."  Omg. Dude.. . I love the Arctic Monkeys, but... It's just a title. And NO... its not really that emotive, no. Or when he says stuff like  "Lets get a timeline cookin'.." Who talks like that???  I feel better now.   Go ahead... Give it to me.
I’m just a 20 year old college guy but this band makes me so emotional. Tranquility Base has been my mental escape from rougher days for some years now. I just fantasize that I’m in a retro suit sipping martinis on the moon; talking about intellectual problems and gambling. It’s peaceful to me at least haha.  Now The Car is a tearjerker. It brings out my loneliness and failed romantic ventures, but in a healing way. Thank you Alex and the Arctic Monkeys, much love.

Alexa Chung _”I wanted to the pub and Alex wanted to read the dictionary in bed”_ Explains Alex lyrical talent.
its such a borefest of an album and they totally ripped off David bowie vocally. ZZZZZ
I love arctic monkeys to a point where it might even be unhealthy
ALEX Is so adorable and akward ans then the Bomb when  he is playing!! The interviewer  did a good job trying  to make him feel comfortable
Zane is literally the biggest sycophant ever 😂 All he can do is just heap praise on an artist regardless of how good their latest work is. Has no critical judgement at all.  The car is no exception.
28:50 The vidid memory in a Car Q - it’s great to hear his nostalgic memory of his dad when he was a kid.
Why does the interviewer talks to him like he knows them personally?
I would of been in tears of laughter if Zane fell off that chair. 😄 🤣
Where I can buy the Neca 09 jacket?
This album is so delightful to listen to. Those vocals from Alex are everything. The whole album is something like it's never done before by any band. I'm glad about the direction they are taking, I'm sure they come up with more mind blowing stuff in the future.
I think that when I listen to this album... I want to take a nap '-' it seems to me take every song is the same, or very very similar ._. Great music tho, make me wanna relax
AM is a Perfect Album.
Does anybody know where is the video of him playing backstage in México city
29:32 his smile is so cute
The interview is nearly as boring as the last 2 albums
i have anxiety (btw who doesnt) and listening to him trying to formulate sentences got me literally on my nerves. but thats fine im still completely in love with him and his art
Zane this is the greatest interview of the year
Hate zane - its so insincere, like the creepy snake from the garden of eden.
Alex’s expressions of “ you just said exactly what I’d never thought to put words to in my own head “ and processing it as he’s replying is priceless
Zane lowe the cringiest crank on planet earth
For sure one of my favorites interviews. Love to know more about the band’s genius work and point of view on all things they can explain and always love to hear Alex talk, living legends!!
Nice editing* I wish the clip was raw.
Zane Lowe is so deferential and cheesy.
come to singapore!!!!!
So cerebral maaaaan lick lick.
Is Alex the new Bryan Ferry ?  Mr image and cool.
Alex is a genius
IDC if I have to be the one to say it, but the last two albums completely bury the rest of the band. Just not for me at all and I'm not convinced one of the best living drummers has any interest in basically having no role in the band anymore. Same goes for the guitar riffs and bass lines that have been buried. Sounds like a totally new band and nowhere close to the one I fell in love with.
I noticed he's been wearing that jacket a lot recently.
Anyone else feel like he's always about to burp or hiccup...
I don't understand why Apple keeps this guy interviewing people. Watching his attempts to be close and cool guy during the interview really makes me uncomfortable. Btw we love you Alex
I feel like the closing song that they refer to was a goodbye song from the band and they decided to leave it off the album because they didn't want to be so final
“Oh this isn’t the record we should make” Alex  You should have went with your gut - and ditched the idea of this record.  Why did you kill your rhythm section? Why have a band when you just croon to hear the sound of your own voice.  The rest of the band must have been so bored - should have been a solo album.  Such an utter disappointment.
This album is good — not great or crazy, just good
Great interview and thoughtful questions ❤
Still so handsome
Tranquility base is criminally underrated. I’m so excited for this album
Mirrorball  > desperately sad, yes! And I felt the Marvin Gaye as well :)  Greetings from Quebec Canada!
@10:02 "it's not a battle between the band and the-" "no it is" how about you let the guy who wrote it speak
Make this an album commentary by pressing play on The Car right when you start the interview and keep it on in the background -- it will end 6 seconds after the interview does.
What jacket does Alex have on? Need that.
By the time Alex finishes his sentence, I already forgot what he was talking about  its also cause Im distracted with how adorable he is
Zane is insufferable.
specific tracks Alex talks about  01:12 There'd Better Be A Mirrorball 02:25 Do I Wanna Know? 10:50 Sculptures of Anything Goes 15:03 Sculptures of Anything Goes 15:37 Star Treatment 18:35  There'd Better Be A Mirrorball 24:27 The Long Good Friday (Francis Monkman) 31:46 Mr. Schwartz 33:46 Body Paint 34:53 From The Ritz To The Rubble
37 minutes of waffle
His interviews are always so strange, he can't put a sentence together in a consistent matter.
33:05 - 33:15 must be "It's Hard to Get Around the Wind". most favourite track of submarine, in my top ten of alex's output ever produced. one of the main reason was the guitar picking, aside from beautiful melodies and lyrics, that made me pick up guitar and learn how to guitar pick that way and it changed my life guitar-playing wise, and i am just a casual guitar playing bloke haha, so Mr. Schwartz is the most standout track for me this album almost only because of that, along with the mysterious moog-powered sound of Sculptures.
KASSA CASSIAN ANDOR CLEM ANDOR CASS
Good lord I wish Zane would shut up, he is speaking for 95% of this interview. No one cares what you think, let the artist talk.
Bear with him man, he lost his train of thought.
In the way the beatles decided to ditch gigs and be a studio band, i feel the arctic monkeys should do the same in reverse. The new albums ok (i actually like it) but it isnt rock n roll and the issue for me is the more of these bland albums they put out, the larger the % of the setlist will be taken up by them
this guys always looks like he is in love with the artist he is interviewing
Respect to the interviewer. Really great job in every sense.
Different age came out different thing. I love new album so much
Alex looks so comfortable in this. This is the best interview i've seen so far for The Car. Real and genuine questions solely on the music itself. I hope Alex and the band knows just how much Arctic Monkeys mean to so many people 🫶
26:37 I love this man
These two know how to converse. It feels/sounds nothing like Kanye speaking to Piers lol. They obviously respect each other very much.
He's so cute.
I had a dream, where I met the Arctic Monkeys and driving around in the city with them. A few days after, they announced their album The Car 👀
Been listening to Zane interviews since like 2009, but last two - three years it's just so annoying. He keeps telling "as a fan as a fan". Mate, we get it. But honestly - does good conversations are based on so much being "friends with artists"? Or maybe it's me who expects too much from Zane.
Zane is such a creep
Zane is probably a really nice person but I must admit I find his saccharine interview style a bit much. Like I’m cringing a lot of the time
You're not from New York City, you're from Rotherham
Such a boring interview
Been like 17 years and Alex still can’t put together a coherent sentence in an interview but can write some of the most beautiful and thought provoking lyrics album after album
I think am and strokes is this it are the perfect 21st century rock albums  I'm really liking the car it's a grower for me
Just "The The Business" ...Thank You Fellas ❤....how beautiful to hear Alex gets emotional like we do listening to that track
why is there a Ψ in your guitar Alex?
Steve Jobs interviewing Alex Turner. CGI is amazing on this one boys.
29:06 I’m not crying, you are
22:57 ‘those’ just like that time when he said it and Miles laughed at him haha
The lasts lines from Zane and Alex in this interview are perfection and sum it up beautifully ❤
The Car has made me appreciate Tranquility Base even more. I am enjoying The Car nonetheless. Agree with Zane on Mirrorball, great song.
Zane I used to trust your reviews  But saying that “the car” is the best album title of the year   Really makes me change every opinion of ya  Even Alex had to humour it Ruined the interview
Does anyone know where I can buy a jacket like Alex's ?
My good God this Zane person is unbearably pretentious. I cannot stand a single interview of his. He babbles on without saying anything at all. I have to unfortunately suffer thru his “interviews” to hear from the artist. I rarely leave comments, but he is just such a try hard - it’s nauseating.
When is the album out
These are some annoying questions, Alex isnt there to be complimented, we want to know his thought process behind his music. Not what he thinks about Zane Lowe's theories and compliments...?
Having 3 am calls from Alex, it's a yes for me.
I love hearing him talk about the old records too. Seems he’s on a bit of a nostalgia kick recently
I love how zane senses people’s discomfort and anxiety and then adjusts his body language and overall demeanour to make them more comfortable
Alex Turner, sigh, the sexiest man alive.
This guy probably has so much in his head
that jacket is soooo cool
My god Zane can waffle. He's the type of guy who's Incredibly adept with the English language and can string a sentence or two together but doesn't say anything unique, or do anything unique.  Has all the tools and everything one would think is needed to create genius but falls massively short, and just talks nonsense?
what a legend! 🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼
Something that I admire about Zane is that he really listens to the music and the arrangement of it. Of course that’s his job, but after listening to the album I heard the strings and the band “competing” and if I didn’t hear Zane point that out, I don’t think I would appreciate the song as much. Taking the time to listen to every part of the song and not taking it for face value is something I would like to start doing, so thank you Zane for inspiring that.
Algum br traduz pelo amor de deus😭
Im so happy because i got the cd today:)
This records Smells like Grammy! it's a true jewel.
Alex is such a cutie <3 also i love the confidence the Monkeys have with every new album to just try new things, new sounds, new ways. That's what shows what a great band and artists they are: they never boxed themselves to one thing.
What makes Zane so great is that he has a way of asking questions real fans want to know.
Duck Fizz loves Alex. An Alex is why their new album is not rock at all
I have had time to digest Mirrorball and Body Paint for a long time now and I gotta admit, Body Paint is undoubtedbly the most mindblowing song I have heard in a while.... the last song that really touched me like that I remember vividly was Resistance by Muse (and they are very different songs) or Death and all of his friends by Coldplay back in the Viva la Vida era.
Does anyone else find Alex Turner really hard to work out?
Zane Lowe and Jo Whiley are the only interviewers who Alex seems comfortable around every single time.
Your music is bad now period
21:48 « it’s amazing that I just said that full title name » 😂
It's so nice to see him being questioned about their MUSIC 🤍
Cant stand zane lowe, the way he dickrides every artist he interviews
what an interview this is wow
Zane is fangirling just like me
Thank you Zane, thank you Alex! Beautiful interview!!
Has anyone got the link for him ‘going a bit broadway’ on Ritz?
accidentally perfect lmao so true
This interviewer is just desperate to be his best mate
You're not from New York City you're from lost your accent.
We need to know that jacket alex is wearing
alex's voice in this interview is doing things to me 😅
Great interview.  Shout out to the expertise of Zane Lowe as interviewer!!!!
Mirrorball is arguably one of the greatest songs ever written. In any genre. Throwing that on for the first time when it dropped and not knowing what to expect for this album and hearing that. Absolute masterpiece
Nice one
What a great interview!
Zane Lowe is a very good interviewer
7:18 Alex still wanted to be one of The Strokes
Growing up is realising this new monkeys sound is phenomenal. I struggled to grow into Tranq hotel but this album has stuck to me straight away. Absolutely unbelievable sounds and song writing. Bring on old Trafford next year 😅
The new AM album, The car, IMO, is very very boring
Zane is like a weird fan girl! its so odd for a bloke to talk to another bloke like this! total simp!
Happy 'The Car' day everyone!
Haven't seen Zane Lowe in years, looks like he's morphed into Steve Jobs since he's been at Apple
i’m not going to lie i’m really sad that they don’t seem to be going back to rock
Alex Turner has never stopped surprising me since the first time I listened to A.M. in 2005... He creates entirely new songs and worlds on every album... He is close to a younger Damon Albarn in the sense that he goes farer and farer with his own experimentations... without trying to explain too much... like any artist, sometimes you do stuff without fully controlling it in the making.
The memory of seeing Zane and Alex on the GONZO couch chatting away a good 16 years ago and now look at them. Makes me feel old but beautifully nostalgic.
37 minutes of Alex Turner ignoring compliments. I love it.
Mirrorball is one of the greatest songs I’ve ever heard but the rest of the album is meh imo. Great interview and great artist!!
An absolute genius in the music world- he can't put a step wrong musically.
i love this man
Wow this man and all
My Nervous Baby! 😭💜💖🙏🏼 Alex is my future-husband! "I ain't quite where I think I am~"
Zane is such a fanboy 😂
really weird interview...it's like Zane Lowe wrote all the songs and Alex has been given 10 minutes notice to pretend to everyone that it was actually him 😄
Sometimes the most creative people don’t have this ability bring you into their inner world and even if they could, probably no one would understand what’s going on… It reminds me discussions with my friend who has dyslexia and I totally understand Zane; how hard it is to moderate this person’s ideas.
Bear with him guys, he’s lost his train of thought
i won’t him
the new album is only 7 seconds longer than this video 🐒🤍
Alex and Harry Styles talk the same!slowly,(cant make one sentence properly hahah)
HOW IN THE WORLD DOES HE LOOK THE SAME AS HE WAS YEARSSSSS AGO??? HE HAS NOT AGED!!!!!! GOOD GRACIOUS!!!
Anyone have a link for the backstage mexican downstroke song?
🔥
amei ❤🇧🇷
Is it just me or does it look like Alex has a lump on his upper right neck near his lymph node?
Very nice interview. Interesting character.
Mr shwarts is the best track! 😍
I’I love how Alex still must work at intellectualizing what they've created, searching for the proper language and words to rationalize the creative process and what ultimately became the end product. I've been a fan, then TBH&C uniquely shifted gears, beautifully. A bit of The Last Shadow Puppets. Looking forward to absorbing the entire album. Worth listening to on vinyl. Keep doing what you're doing...
at this point zane lowe is just a therapist for musicians and artists
I ponder all the questions But just manage to miss the mark.
i love alex sm
AH I LOVE HIM
For Me The "Big Ideas" Is The Best Track On Album ❤️
Alex without Matt is disaster lol
So psyched to hear the new album tomorrow!!
I want an Alex Turner Directer film now 😂
i love how he can’t say a single sentence without pausing and thinking and stuttering but can write some of the most beautiful music
Their best, easily.
Stand out track - Sculptures of anything goes❤
Zane Lowe : i can't thank you enough for making what you've made Alex : i beg your pardon? (to fill the awkward silences)
19:13 Best ever Zane line "I'm sorry for offending anybody"....  Who thinks what works or doesn't work in the ardio anymore.  To be honest I hate the last two albums with a selfish Alex feat Arctic Monkeys trying to be the next Frank Sinatra to made his dad proud of him.  Falied!!!  BTW: Wet leg is making all that money for Domino that Arctic monkeys wasted the last 4 years.
As a fan
I loved the interview! Alex is a beautiful human being!
I hate than Zane interupted what is presumably a Alex and Jamie Top Golf driving range story. robbed of a gem.
I enjoyed watching this, Zane has always been so knowledgeable about whoever the band/artist is, since mtv days. Very relaxed interview chat 👍
Me estás preguntando si voy a ver 37 minutos de entrevista a un tipo que te puede armar una frase cada 30 minutos? Pues si
preordered the album and i can’t wait to get it!! i’m so excited and proud of them! seeing them live was honestly a life changing experience. i wish i could’ve gone with my best friend since they’re also his favorite band, but unfortunately he passed away 2 years ago. still, i’m sure he was there with me and i’ll enjoy the album as much as i can for both of us.♡
always love the turner interviews with zane lowe because you can tell theres a level of trust and knowing there that makes alex so much more at ease and makes the interview so much better
Great interview
alex turner you will always be famous
zane is fantastic, and alex is a genius. the album deserves all the praise it will get
oofff. this was a rough watch in parts...
We need to start a Gofundme to buy Zane a more comfortable chair.
What an amazing interview
ugh my ❤️
11:33 i thought my i-net is lagging
I love looking at his behavior when in TLSP mode versus AM haha 😂.
Watching this WHILE the album is out in one minute, I am so ready! Alex' voice is sooo soothing and what an amazing job Zane is doing getting him excited and interested. Such a good interview. Can't wait to see them live again.
I've been listening to "Mirrorball" on repeat for hours when it came out. I can't explain what it does to me. It's just in sync with whatever is happening inside me. I don't even noticed I listened it so much until my phone died.
Alex has such a soothing speaking voice. Love him. So excited for the new album
I enjoy just listening to Alex's voice, whether he's singing, or speaking.
Zane doing chair yoga during the interview 😂
Zane’s thoughts on Mirrorball are coherent to mine and articulated really well
Steve Jobs really knows how to interview bands
💗💗💗
alex te amo muchísimo
OMG Steve Jobs and Alex Turner together on this podcast
Is this satire?
How did Zane Lowe become the voice of UK indie, he's so awful
Such a great songwriter but so very uncomfortable being interviewed even after all these years.
I can't imagine myself having a conversation with this guy because I'm the same when it comes to finding it hard to catch the exact words to express what I'm thinking but instead of spacing it out like he does I spew out random semi-connected phrases one after the other.
2022, and still the handsome human being eh Alex😍
He seems like an alien that is trying to act like a human.
I need the Broadway Ritz link right now
Thankyou alex'lovely interview 'wat agifted artist you are.people really don't know you at all.a genuine guy .Nice to see and listen to you as the real alex turner. Thankyou.x
I mean imagine not loving this dude, one who cannot be bothered to accept a compliment and keeps writing incredible music. truly a king
26:36 "I think that was deliberate."
Let this be the last elevator music album please
"nice one"
Arctic Monkeys would make a great Bond-Song. There would be no discussion ever
Already feeling album of the year on this one just off the singles alone. So happy they’re still cementing their place as all time greats.
so excited to listen to this masterpiece
It sounds like an Alex solo record though, what are the other guys doing?
Lol @ Zane trying to tell Alex about his own music....
It’s a fantastic album. Piece of art
Eurgh Zane…
can’t wait anymore it’s coming out in only few hours 😪
Where can I come that jacket?
Alex and Miles Kane once almost ran me over in a mini at a zebra crossing in Soho.  True story.
21st October is going to be a fantastic day for music.
THATS WHAT IT TAKES TO SAY GOODNIGHT ;) LYRICS YOU ALL WILL BE SINGING SOON
I can’t wait! You guys have got me through some dark times!
Anybody got the video of the broadway bit when he’s talking about playing From the Ritz to the Rubble? 😅
Any one have that ritz to rubble clip
Broadway style happened at Rock en Seine
What is the music playing in the start and the end of the show? Love the beat!
I like how he gets excited by his own memories.. Zane is a great interviewer and it's a great interview :)
I love what we’ve heard from this new album. But I get what Zane’s saying of don’t you want to release the beast just one more time and give us a high tempo rock song
this might be the best arctic monkeys interview. never seen alex turner being so comfortable and interested during an interview
Funny that they don’t use their apple headphones
THE WAY THIS GUY SPEAKS, EXPRESSES HIMSELF IN THE CONVO IS PRETTY MUCH HOW I ARTICULATE MY IDEAS HAHA
Even though Alex is still his vague self in some respects, this is the most emotion I've seen from Alex in an interview ever. I love how they can chat like old friends - it feels like Alex is being Alex and not just a frontman.
Can't wait for Fantano to give it a 6.
Such a very insightful interview. Thank you for this!
I don't know how to say this without feeling like it's an understatement. But Arctic Monkeys really is the band of my life. I'm so grateful, honestly, SO grateful to have grown and lived (I still am tho) in the same timeline as this band. These guys have created their own sound and universe each time, flawlessly. Absolute geniuses.
He is just brilliant. Said what i said
Seems like he's living in this jacket right now
Knowing that Mirrorball is emotional for Alex aswell makes me feel better about crying to it lmao
Zane interrupting the sentences of the interviewees is just annoying.
Back in 2018, exactly here with Zane, Al lost his train of thought and stuttered. Four years later, he still does... But that's our Al and we still love him and the Monkeys! Bring on the 21st!! 🔥
Only a New Zealander can do such an interview, Zane you keep setting the bar very very very high man, thank you for that, I have difficulty watching and listening to other interviews that you don't feature in.
I think this is the first interview Alex has given in this press run where he felt genuinely excited to talk about his and the band's creation. Credit to Zane.
ngl i want alex’s jacket so bad, wonder if i can find it for sale somewhere
Good to see bald John Butler, interviewing some lost in sauce guy
3 down....And its Beautiful Alex!  I cant wait to here Sculptures!  The Dark,  Humbuggy one!  👌
Anyone got a link to from the ritz to the broadway?
I feel like he's saying a lot in his mind. Like not saying it out loud he just- thinks-
I’m 20yo Japanese guy and don’t know how much time of my life I spent to learn English, but I’m sure it was worth it.
Had to add the hair comment in there lol
I can't wait to hear the new album 😩🤍
Zane: Comes out with some incredibly descriptive statement/ question. Alex: ‘Yeah…’ as his brain is still trying to process it 🤣 still refreshing after 16 years that he hasn’t changed in interviews
I don't like the interviewer
So anybody found the broadway version of From The Ritz To The Rubble yet? :D
alex's face at the mirrorball interpretation haha <3 glad zane focuses on it so much, i know it's a single we've all heard but it's my favorite song so far.
thank you zane lowe for this ❤️❤️❤️
❤
Alex Turner: not saying anything in interviews since 2006
He's determined to use that jacket on all the car interviews I love it
0:28 i feel like deep down, this is how he wishes fans would have treated tbhc. he's so petty lol
cada uno de los  cambios sonoros que hicieron como banda me inspiraron a seguir creciendo en mi vida cotidiana. true story bros! ✨️🌿✨️
"Nice One"   A God amongst men...
Actor's studio called, they don't want you back if you ever were there and if not they don't want you at all, Zane. Jesus, if you don't mean it don't say it... He just feels like he perfected the art of fakin it..but in a very noticeable way (at least to me)
Me to almost to heavy for miranda, shes smart so smart,
His interviews are like his songs, you have to listen many times to get the full essence :) it kind of grows on you.
"There better be a Mirrorball" takes me to a place no other song has. One of the best songs I've ever heard
kinda cool to think zane has been interviewing alex since he was 19
Love Alex Turner and invest time in all albums equally, thanks Zane
I'm starting to see signs of aging in Alex That gets me kinda sad
Not gonna lie I didn’t like Their last album Tranquility except maybe a couple songs like some or most people have but I will say that these new songs have grown on me. I’m genuinely looking forward to their new album and I have to give credit where credit is due, they are able to pull off the 70s style especially with the latest track I ain’t quite where I think I am.
How can Alex go from looking like he’s in his 40s to looking in his 20s just like that it’s freaking me out
This video is fascinating!!! Greetings from Chile 🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱
I should have flown to Kiribati so I could hear the album before anyone else LOL
Still waiting for him to burp man, after all these years.
Zane interviewing AM is always good. Alex is just himself ❤ I still watch the very 1st one 🤗
"Alex you're the greatest artist of all time"  Alex "Right..."
Agreed; Mirrorball is one of the only songs in recent memory that I fell in love with as soon as it kicked on. Such a good track
Perfect interview (deliberately)
I love this band. They will always be formative to me. The greatest ever. Objectively they aren’t but to me they are number 1
Great interview! Thank you! A few more hours! Can't wait! I bought my 1st CAR this year so when I heard the album name announced I was like no waaay, epic! <3
so excited for this album
one of the best interviews out there. i smiled and clutched my chest so many times 🥹🥰
I wonder if Zane is a fan
Sometimes I wonder whether it was drugs that made a whole in his mind and crippled his talking or simply his consciousness is in a different level of human evolution.   Irrespective, I am buying two CDs. One for me and one for my kids to enjoy this in 30 years.
We're so used to everything at our fingertips, people talking fast, a lot of information, and Alex is just a totally out of “this” world human being. He is always giving his maximum in the interviews.
alex just said myself instead of meself idk what to do
I have to wait 12 ish hours to listen to it but you know. I’ll watch this until then.
Every new Arctic Monkeys album is awful…       for the first few weeks, then the penny drops, you realise the genius & it becomes your all time favourite.
The only thing I want to know now ,since we are getting a new AM album ….. When are TLSP coming back?
they’ve done a great job with the new sound, if they were to sound the same almost 20 years later then it would get boring.
i wish zane would let him talk
Alex looks so happy here❤🥺❤️
I like how Zane kept repeating - me as a fan, and just basically captured everything we’re thinking. Thank you for this! ❤
Thank you for letting Jacket understand how much we love him 🙌
ONLY 6 HOURS UNTIL WE CAN LISTEN TO IT
I swear I will go to his wardrobe and steal that green mechanic jacket
I can’t wait to hear the new album 🥶🥶
As a fan living in Asia, I’ve already listened to the new album on Spotify and I must say new songs are so nice ❤ദ്ദി˶ｰ̀֊ｰ́ )
You had the chance to express what most of the fans think, thank Alex for what he and the rest of the band have done. What a nice album it is. 🫶🫶🫶
I love this man, band, music since 2013!
Been like 17 years and Alex still can’t put together a coherent sentence in an interview but can write some of the most beautiful and thought provoking lyrics album after album
Thank you for letting Alex know how much we love and appreciate them ❤
That was fast
it feels so good to finally hear about his new ideas - especially new music, can’t wait for the car
10 more hours and I can finally listen to this album 😩❤️😭
algum brasileiro faz uma tradução
he didn't age at all
Alex loves this jacket, and we love Alex
AM7 baby
why havent there been any interviews with all 4? Pour Jameh and o'maley havent even been in an interview...🙄 someone needs to sort that out pronto
alex turner my icon

Wish it was Matt Wilkinson interviewing he's great. Zane sometimes seems fake
I love u Alex
Can't wait to hear it!
alex turner will forever be the goat
amazing
alex really loves that jacket
