What's the progress with Dan's tunnel?
Redoing this in 2025 or nah?
Very engaging and fun.
Gav in full Jason Mewes mode. Love it!
The day have cut his hair, was the day he met her
Oh yeah, it look so similar to some of movies show how it looks when depth charge blew up under water.
This aged interestingly
after watching this again in 2025. And after a certain underwater implosion tragedy that happened in 2024. I feel like we need an update to this video....
Please please remake this video ❤❤❤❤
aged like wine
This is like something out of a old Godzilla film.
At least it's an explosion, not an implosion.
Really random but you have a high pitched noise in the background 6:26
Where are the insane frame rates?
Comment section so cool and edgy “this didn’t age well” 🥴🥴🥴🥴🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
When did Chris Tanev quit playing hockey and become a YouTuber?!?!
gopro should add “crash, bang, hot, wet and up” into their marketing
Well well well. You know this is just the opposite of an implosion from another submarine...
Where's Dan?
I would love to see a revisit of this one with both submarine and surface ships. And some slower frame rates.
Gav with long hair is not OK
I like how gav transferred his head hair to his chin
This did not age well
A nice type VII model to be fair. Fun fact, that little escape hatch that popped open can be found near the galley of the sub and is just behind the main control room. SH3/SH5 are great games for U-boats BTW with a lot of mods available. Digression aside, this is probably the best footage I've seen of underwater explosions so far. But it would be. It always is on this channel.
Crash bang hot wet and up all the key dangers to look out for
I purchased a go pro to record aspects of an underwater dream holiday  in a far away land. Pre use tests worked well so boarded the plane. Charged it the night before the dive too. First time i switched it on it recoreded two seconds of a beautiful turtle swimming by then the battery shorted out. Tried recharging bit it wouldn't accept a charge.. Thanks go pro. You need to look at your batteries.
This is gibing me Titan flashbacks
And was a big KABOOM !
People watching this after the titan submersible
To be quite honest, the explosion reminds me of a supernova
Gav looks like a freshman without his beard!😂
cool stuff, wonder how diff if the submarine is metal.
Shoulda stuck some little sailor figurines inside. Red food coloring...
You guys should get a lego SW deathstar with explosives inside!!!
اتمتى لو في ترجمة صحيحة للعربية 😢❤
lovely video, thank you
wow, Gav has had all sorts of hair and beard styles. he looks so young here!
This didnt age well
This video aged wonderfully lmfaoooooo
It was you guys! I thought I was in a Saw movie when I stumbled into a warehouse and inside was a camera pointed at a pool with an aquarium on a stand in it and no fish.
Wonder what was written on the metal bar... 🤔 All I could make it is the first word: "Sink" It was a sentence though, 5 or 6 words worth. 🤷‍♂️
All the idiots coming here to say this didn't age well, despite this being not even close to what happened with the titan sub. Unless they think any video with the mere existence of subs hasn't aged well.
Now do an implosion version where the sub's model is the titan model
"That one didn't age quite so well.."
Did anyone hear the high pitched noise? About 6:30 in the video and I can hear it. Had to stop the video because of it. Really cool video otherwise. 😂
Ok, to any Navy or Retired Navy badasses in the comments: How accurate was our favorite goofball in this video? One more question: Would you show this to recruits as a good explanation of depth charges?
5:18 This point on is one of the most curious things to visualize. This is basically what happens in a core collapse supernova. The core longer supports itself through fusion, and the gravity causes it implode in on itself. You can imagine the similar kind of fluid physics involved.
This aged well
oh jeez. i sure hope idiots don’t come flooding this video with terrible comments in the future.
This did not age well...
Titan went instead of crushing you to meat stew I will make to go bye bye.
I would like to thank the ants who lost their lives during this test
This did not age too well...
GoPro is garbage. way too expensive, dies when you touch it with small amount of force, horrible video quality.
at least there wasn't 5 billionaires in it
Thi
How that tank survived is beyond me.
Sub-marine does NOT include a model in a fish-tank.  That's bad.
This aged well
Could you redo it but with Titan sub and the explosion from inside.   Please
This dident age well
1:13 he is probably cringing having to hold that thing
Haha feels like the 5 billon airs didn't see this video tisk tisk
This aged really well ☠☠
Could you film a pressur cooker exploding?
This didn’t age well
The problem is you’re using flexible air bladder.  Subs are more rigid and has different deforming characteristics
this did not age well XD
This aged like the titanic.
This aged horribly 💀💀💀💀💀
5:30 7:14
That did not age well
This appeared at the perfect time. F doze rich ppl, lmao.
this popped up on my recommended at the wrong time
Wonder where they found the sub and what kind it is.
Well, this appeared in my feed at awkward part of 2023... XD
Hey it's 2023 and this is now a meme
Now do an implosion.
that one didn't age quite well...
Sponsored by Oceangate
This didn’t age well
this video has uh. Become slightly relevant.
5:47 me too Gav
That’s pretty much, (kind of) what a supernova would look like…..😁And learning is knowledge🤭
welp this title didnt age very well |:
Did not age very well
Surprised this didn't pop up on everyone's recommendations a few weeks ago
this aged… interestingly
4:50  What are the chances of the explosion looking exactly like the picture in the thumbnail!???
this aged perfectly
hahahaha...HAHAHAHAHAHAAAAA. rich people dying
didn’t age well
That's some camera, my wife and i were wondering, if you have heard the term SHAPE SHIFTING   used and if you know what it is? Jan 2025 we will be releasing the first video documentary of a clan of SABE bigfoot people. We have been very closely interacting for nearly 45-48 years on our dairy farm. We had deleted the shape shifting demo. because it is so unbelievably impossible looking and nearly instantaneously done, it is beyond our current understanding of physics. To be perfectly honest it looks demonic, we are not trying to scare anyone this is intended as an education video an awareness introduction, with their permission. Almost 50 years we would know if these people were demons  they are not, they simply are evolved millions of years passed humanity, they are sick of hiding. THE mind is a powerful tool, they can access 80-85 % of their brain humans  10 %  that is the key  God   = 100%    educated   guess , oh ya  ,God is real absolutely. leave a message if interested
After the Titan in Summer 2023, this episode aged like milk. 🤣
I feel like this is the worst time for this to be recommended to me (the ocean gate thing)
This did not age well…
This aged well.
Scuttled
It's happening in reality  -Titan
This is ironic, it's been in my feed since Titan
Hmm   the reality of this is that you are not taking scale into account,  The thickness of the plastic is not in scale to the explosive force used to destroy it. it simply is not realistic.   Try getting a model builder to make you a sub from thin aluminum or some imitation lead foil and the same for the pressure hull and scale your explosive accordingly.      Now THAT would be destruction worthy of SLO MO.
Ain’t no way this got recommended to me after-
This and the Hydro Press channel hit my recommend at the most tasteful time.
Hahaha
not youtube putting this in my recommended now ☠️☠️☠️ aged like milk but still a good video
Wonder why this of all videos is getting recommended…….
This aged badly
I can't think of any reason why this video is being recommended to me in July 2023. Nothing related to submarines has happened...
Oceangate should have watched this first
Oh... oh no...
Guess no one was seriously considering the power of an implosion back then.
Oceangate brought me here....
Hehehe, YouTube recommended ftw rn lmao
why is this in my recommended less than a 3 weeks after Titan imploded?
Why YouTube decided to show mi this now? Interest. Let's think... Of, wait...
Guys lets's explore the Titanic
Aged well
make an implosion slow mo vid :)
I love the timing of this
Soo just now yt decided to recommend this specific video to me lmfao unintentionally aged like milk 😂😂😂
Love it
Carbon fiber is what I'd make my sub from it's all the rage now.
regarding the fastness of the shockwave... shockwave travel at pretty much the speed of sound through the medium they travel in.  You're probably used to seeing them in air at about 340 m/s but in water, it'll be more like 1500 m/s.
"That one didn't age quite so well." -JonTron
So many submarine implosion videos in my recommended feed lately
Well that didn’t age well. 🤣
this aged poorly
I would hate to be in an exploding submarine that's for sure
THIS AGED WELL LMAO
just here coz oceangate
That one didn’t age so well
Now record a 55 gallon drum imploding.... Every thing Ive found on the net literally looks like an edit...  SO fast...
Wow... YouTube has some wonderful timing on this one...
Huh wierd this showed up
fantastic time to be recommended this video
this....aged like milk
"Creature Attack"
Soooooo who got this recommended to them during the Titan Submersible implosion?
Anyone here after TITAN??
This didn't age well
Another great video the last depth charge was so powerful the air bubbles shot though the little holes in the middle of the sub
titanic sub moment
What a time to recommend this video
People are saying this didn’t age well…  Maybe they should learn the difference between an implosion and explosion
rather interesting recommendation considering recent events
YouTube is pretty weird to recommend me this video after current events..
Kinda ironic 😬
brilliant video .  what more can i say .
Wonder why this had resurged in relevancy...
well, this aged slightly poorly
This one didnt age too well
This reminds me of U571
Stunning work.  Have to watch in small increments to give brain time to get the brute force finessed.
This channel already predicted it
Wonder why I keep getting submarine implosion recommendations a lot recently? 🤔
I think the "waterlogged" explosive actually looks smaller because it set off right as the cavitation from the first explosives was sucking back in... Maybe the energy got pulled in too? I know nothing of fluid dynamics.
didn’t age well
Please keep this video from being filled with Ocean Gate Titan comments, this was recommended to me again and it will only be a matter of time before people flood it with comments about it
Soooo.. o bet this video is gonna go viral again.
Showed up on recommendations.... cool 😎
How does the glass not break.
This video is relevant now!
Watching this in 1912 from atlantic ocean
Do an implosion video...
I know this is old But a realistic " Implosion " where a model chamber / sphere to captue the implosion of compressed air is heated to flash over and  explosion
now do the ocean gate implosion also in slow motion
It’s so funny how my recommendations have been affected by the ‘event’.
This showed up in my recommend Lmfaoooo 😭😭😭😭😭
This aged poorly
RIP TITAN
Really Youtube... more submarine recommendations.
Well we all know why we are here...
Of course this is recommended to me now
bros blazed as at the start i swear to gawd
Who's here because of Titan? lol
Would love to see high-speed interior footage of a pressure vessel imploding, filmed at an extreme depth!
This aged well
this video has a brand new meaning 💀
Who's here from watching videos about the Titan Sub implosion?
A single depth charge less than 20-25 feet away from the sub would be enough to cause major damage, maybe even outright destroy the boat. In real life, the first explosion would have probably done the job and sank the U-Boat it was so close.
This is pretty awesome. Love it. How much is that camera ?
Y’all know why you clicked this video in 2023
They should implode one
Youtube algorithm always on point
Just recommended to me
Lmao youtube suggest after the Titan lol
this one aged well in 2023
You guys now have to do a real implosion slow mo video. It would be used everywhere instead of simulations.
what would be very interesting is to film an impolsion underwater with your cameras
submarin
POUIDWGAIUFBWAF
This got recommended to me now after what happened like a week ago 😂 Great timing YouTube 🤷🏼‍♂️
Why is this recommended to me right now  I mean it didn’t aged well
hmm  why is this in the algorithm i wonder
Where did you get the uboat from?
that may or may not have aged well. Although IMO ill go with the latter
Well... the timing
this has not aged well.
This video aged well.
that's a really nice u boat model to waste.
well that aged well (the titan sub just imploded)
POV: ur a fish and you see some billionaires in a sub
Off course now, that I get this recommended
Yep we get it…Very Sad :(
The hull being full of water apart from a small air bladder prevented the charachteristic air filled chamber implosion damage from taking place, the water is a tonne per cubic metre against air being just 1.3 kg per cubic metre so the water shock wave merely propagated across the hull instead of crushing.   A large metal or very hard plastic air filled pressure cylinder tightly inside the model would simulate a submarine's vulnerable air filled pressure vessel.
it did not age well
All these submarine videos now trending.
This aged well...
Algorithm strikes again
Nice videos Gavin . 📹please tell us more about your video cameras and gear
Video got recommended after titan submersible imploded
U know, why we are here 😢
Woops!
Hello men and women of culture. Our gathering was not a coincidence.
Cinematography  is amazing!
ofcource i see this now
Don’t know why I went in expecting a full-size 300 pound depth charge. Still a little disappointed.
Fun fact: Popping a balloon is akin to "imploding" a balloon because the outside pressure is seeking to fill the lower pressure pocket on the inside of the balloon. The puncture is the "weak point" which acts instantaneously.
Youtube algorithm tastelessly deciding that submarine explosions are topical this week...
Want to see a carbon fiber hull
Love that this is on my timeline given current events😂
"please reconnect your controller"
This being recommended today is quite "funny" gotta love the algorithm
The algorithm recommended this to me today
Who's here after the Oceangate sub imploded
This was an *ex*plosion. Would it be distasteful to do a submarine *im*plosion video next?
The moment you realize The Slow Mo Guys foreshadowed the titanic submarines fate
please redo this video but show us it imploding instead of exploding. its sad to hear what happened, and hearing how quick it occurs, in 2 nano seconds the implosion snaps your spine already and your dead, and it takes the brain 4 nano seconds to realize what's occurring, so its so quick you're crushed before your brain even has the chance to process a single thing. id love to see that in slomo!
RIP to the five people who died via the submersible in the ocean 💔.
This aged like milk...
so sad to imagine what could have hapoen with Titan.
Ironic this popped up on my feed when there is a sub that came apart near the Titanic.
Who's come here (again) becaues of the Titanic submarine disaster?
Who’s here because of Titan?
This is an explosion not implosion.  So not what happened to the titan
Sad, this happened to the 5 who died on Sunday who were in the Titan submersible...
Now we know what happened
Who else is here because of ocean gate
Pretty much the hammer of Thor ripping threw the water..
7:05 pause and see the face looking to the left.. creepy
Great go pro commercial… I mean video
5:05 Gav: "It's always just so interesting to see explosions at such a leisurely pace." Taken out of context, that sounds like psychopathic talk lol
I think the submerged explosions are the most interesting. Thank you for this presentation.
You might blow the tank apart before you hurt the submarine
Gav looks like the drummer of every Indie band to ever exist.
Gavin trying to remember the name for Quarks: Crash, Bang, Hot, Wet, and Up
Das Boot 2021)
Thank you Gav and Dan. This is super cool. Cheers!
I think you did a great job. I think you should have put your charges in a pattern like it would have been in war time. Like in Das Boot
Where do I get this model sub lol
Snapping the front of the sub explo wave
Explozion and implozion
When you live in slow mo kije the spiders
I wonder how powerful are those preshure bubbles
The best place to be on that sub would be directly next to the depth charge, it just instantly vaporized everything nearby. Being stuck in an air pocket somewhere waiting to die is much worse..
What happened to the other guy? I thought these guys came in a pair.
7:17 the aurora borealis
"Underwater >>>MODELL<<<Submarine Explosion" Clickbait
This was freaking cool. One of my favourites from you guys! If you did something like this again, maybe binding the camera to the object being exploded would give better footage, with wire or some such since adhesive would probably be ripped apart by the shockwaves.
Lol. So slo-mo it took 9:32.
iv a real rc submarine you could have used,,typ2 and a nuclear trafager
Not accurate subs full of water no pressure difference still cool
Would the explosion be more powerful in deeper water where the pressure is proportional to depth?
*subnautica flashbacks*
in the minute 5:37 a heart was formed in the explosion
Behold: The sawed off U-boat!
One destroyed Uboat - nice!
Those poor sailors in a real submarine during the War.
He’s looking more and more like Jay from Jay and silent Bob
not me watching on a 1080p monitor
Forgive me being late, but this experiment really ought to be done in a larger pool. In such a small tank, shockwaves from the explosion are going to rebound off the sides. To see how it would really look, you need a lot more water around it. For the model size, one of those pop-up family pools that are about 4 metres across.
irl it wasnt the actual explosive force of the depth charges that were a danger to Uboats, it was the force of the water closing back in on the airpocket created by the explosion, the water would close back in with such force it would punch a hole through the metal hull of the Uboat, and depth charges that went off on the sides or top of the Uboats were little danger compared to those that went off directly underneath the Uboat. or so say the numerous German Uboat captains who spoke about such things.
what scale was that U boat? would love a kit that size. looked like a Type VII.
DAS BOOT!
Is it I or is quality just going down the drain??? WTF was that? I could not even go to the end of it as it is being so uninteresting... Everything from the title to the experiment is misleading: The submarine model is obviously made of 1 plastic sheet instead of hundreds of steel plates riveted together... and the depth charge is just another joke in terms of explosion radius and damages, just look at WW2 footage and see the amount of water being displaced at the surface, then remember Archimede and imagine the force you need to lift tons of water flying  3 to 4 meters high in the air from an explosion at minimum 20 meters depth... One way to achieve proper test results would have been to take the real specs of a U-boat and a depth charge and scale them down: Make a thin outside layer with riveted thin steel plates, fill them up with water (Yes, if the sub is submerged that means the space between the outer hull and the crew compartment is flooded and water is not compressible and therefore the impact wave of the explosion is way more devastating). Anyways, I guess it was cheaper to go for the easy way out and maximize the profit on monetization and product placement. And the Gopro not breaking even so it is literally right next to the depth charge just sums it all up... From an angry Sub enthusiast.
Historically, depth charges worked best when they detonated below the submarine, as opposed to beside it. This would create one the shockwave, but also a void which the submarine would fall into, enhancing the damage.
That glass be strong 💪
100% flawed testing method
This makes me want to see rocket motors on toy cars and I don't know why.
I wish it was done in a bigger container so we can see the explosion not being interrupted by glass
Aww, disappointed.
4:23 look at the little smoke ring that came out of the water
An underwater submarine?! Zany!
This video makes you appreciate what Wolfgang Petersen did in "Das Boot" in 1981
I wish I had a better camera :( .... but I guess I need subscribers first!
“Not a real submarine there quite expensive”
Gavin! I found you!....RDR2 fans 🤣
You look like a member of a journey cover band with the long hair and stocking 😂
when i saw the thumbnail i thought it was subnautica for a second
There goes the Kriegsmarine
I really wanted your to put the charge inside the sub
I can't help but keep thinking this is like the big bang theory lol, the universe expanding then like a black hole collapses back in on its self
Could you do one on the cavitation that happens on a submarine propeller or some other marine propeller? I.e. when bubble destroy metal and make lots of noise!!!
' A recent drop in enlistments at Navy recruiting centers has been blamed on a YouTube video. ..'
May i ask how the sub is staying underwater :o that is an awesome model sub yo
Saying underwater submarine is redundant , because the word SUBMARINE  literally means underwater.
Gavin unintentionally making reference footage for vfx artist everywhere.
A simulation of a truly tragic event. That last type VII (?) submarine would've taken around 46 souls with her. Men with families and a history to tell, each and every one of them
imagine if slow mo guys and mister beasts made a video together
Luv a long haired nerd 🤤
Gav needs to bring this hairstyle back, he looks like a chill guy
BUT ...the shockwave will be reflected off the tank sides so really you need a bigger tank.
Mr opiate has been abusing for a very long time
"Das Boot (1981)" brought me here (half way thru the movie) 🧨
Now use real submarine and explode and engine and be inside
The thumbnail looks like a rocket ship blasting off
it took me a second then i realized Gavin reminds me of Jay from Jay & silent Bob in that outfit
2 things: what kind of model is that U-Boat and where did you get it?
I believe that the vfx team that worked on Solo a Star Wars story used a similar technique to create the explosion on the mountain. Filmed a charge underwater and then comped it in later, looked fantastic.
recreate this in a vacuum, slow mo explosives in space!
GrungeGav.... hm. Not a fan. Prettyboy mode again please.
4:51 **Go back to Check if it is the thumbnail**
Strange seeing Gav without a beard, I've got used to it.
would it be possible to set up multiple Gopros and synchronize them so that they capture alternating frames to double or triple the frames captured then combine the files to make a single slow motion video?
I have GoPro hero 9 black
Blowing  stuff up...for science! 😁
Can u pls make similar videos by keeping ships on the surface..to see the blast effect on it.
7:41 ontop of the submarine in the explosion, it kinda looks like a shark🤔😃thats cool
Ohhhhhhh, hello, this isn’t Too Much Tuna 😄   Now I’m gonna have to watch my favorite prank show with Gil Faizon and George St. Geegland!
You should do an old ship like the black pearl or something. Do an inside view of a wall exploding and it sinking from inside and out would love to see it.
awesome, that shockwave reacted really fast
How is that not breaking the glass
It’s so intriguing to see what Gavin’s eyes will catch when it’s still going as fast as 200fps. He just casually throws in stuff like, “You can see the shockwave,” and, “I think I saw the thumbnail in there.” He’s been doing this for so long that even the tiniest of details pops out to him, and half the time I can’t see what he’s pointing at until he uses the arrows 😭
You should have had the submarine model filled with air like a real sub I am sure it would have been different
Aliens be like:
this whole video is an ad
Isn't anyone going to pay an f for that greatly detailed u boat model. 😥
who invented the camera is a genious but the guys who came up with the ones you are using are deffenetly not to be missrecogized .
Can you go over how you made the depth charges please
how much did the model cost?
I don't know why I thought you guys were blowing up a real submarine...lol
BTW That is a German U-boat
Still a great video!
7:46 the mushroom
This is what i see when i enter the void in my cyklops lol
What happened to the other guy your partner?
Ooooooooooohhhhhh I’m about to war nerd on you. That’s not a submarine it’s a u-boat. Which is a semi submersible.  Ok upon further inspection I am actually wrong. Jumped the gun there.  To be accurate though it has to be air tight inside the sub and pressurized for depth. The frame reacts much differently under those conditions  Also look at the color of the water after the sub cracked open. That’s how the cutters tasked with sinking subs would know they got a fatal hit. Brown water and debris.
The difference is this is a plastic model.  If it were metal it would be more impressive.
Why are all the charges so high up? Aren't DEPTH charges usually from below?
Bigger. Bigger boom. Bigger target. Find a pond. Big propane tank. One pound charges. Make big boom. Sink tank. (But seriously. This was awesome. Kudos)
You forgot Down.
Real submarines don't utilize a flexible air bladder which made breaking the bladder more difficult.
You guys gotta get together with Pommijatkat
4:24 a small o ring came from the smoke. Kinda cool
awesome
The most effective use of a depth charge would have been below the sub. This would have concentrated the force of the blast up, breaking the sub’s keel.
Yikes, your hair looks awful!
Watch Das Boot. That makes it easier to imagine the screams and gore to help top this video out.
4:24 I love that small smoke ring
That explosion looks like a nuke explosion
The circle of smoke on the second bomb
crash bang hot wet and up certified
3:15 Looks like the sun
So, you were watching Das Boot, eh?
Great footage 👍
Not a good movie for sub sailors.
The sub should be weighed and filled with air its nit taking little damages because it’s waterlogged
Gav definitely had some shroom experiences lol
SUB IN A TUUUUUB 🎉🎉🎉
Would of been better if he just got a bigger tank instead of compromising the subs integrity
You could say it up Chucked
Want you to get a video high to higher explosion intensity? o.O
Slow-MO idea: a guy breaking bricks with hand (not the top-down chop tho).
I was gonna mention something about the lack of depth and how it would effect the results but I forgot you're doing this for fun and not necessarily science.
Rip little submarine crew
Please tell me what submarine model kit this is. Thank you.
4:22 THE SMOKE RING
I'm curious, how exactly did the slow mo guys come into being? Are you two like, reps for the company that makes the phantoms, do you have some other job that gives you easy access to the high speed cams, did you just inherit a bucket load of money and decided to buy a bunch of high speed cameras with it, or did you simply find the cameras abandoned in some weird warehouse? I'm curious because I've looked into the cost of buying a phantom camera, and, uh...well, let's just say I expected it to be expensive and it turned out that it still managed to surprise me. So I looked into less powerful high speed cameras and they're still, at the bare minimum, a few thousand dollars. I wanted to make some cool slow motion shots of my own, and my wallet cried foul. Then (my wallet) proceeded to sob uncontrollably for about a day before making peace with the fact that these cameras are not at all accessible by the general public lol. If I ever win the lottery though, a phantom camera is definitely on my list of crazy fun stuff to buy
You sank my Battleship.
0:11. “Not a real submarine, they’re quite expensive.”: I like 👍 it!. I think 💭 that a real submarine would cost billions.
and... up

Zerstörer voraaaus! ALAAAARM!!
Realy good job.. 👍👍👍👍
0:41 however, a gopro camera will NOT survive being shot at by a cannon. dan can verify this
Gav hahahahah What Mnidendwer easter eggs 😂
These are the videos that make me convinced that space is a fluid. Underwater explosions follow the life cycle of stars nearly exactly.
Cool vortex ring at 4:25
Next up: nuclear explosion in slow mo
where did you get the model uboat from?
2 things  1) 1S=1H for 2:49 for 10hour video :D  Heck I'll render it out for ya :D  2) BIGGER pool body of water, bigger bang. This is one of the most fun things to watch!  👍👍👍
Where's dan?
Yeah but the subs not pressurized??????
After seeing this explosion, I realized what our Sun is) it looks like it is visible to us at the moment of the explosion and we live so fast that we managed to evolve)))
Holliwoodish effectrs)
I found this video by acident , but what i want say , i am intresting about ww2 german submarines and when i saw this i cant imanige it how the crew feels when preasure hull copalse after near detonation of depth charge , or even near miss detonation could be horible when submarine survive but entire hull vibrate and things flying around .... , last video fate many of the german uboats when submarines was lost with all hands.
Very realistic. Gives us very close idea of the damage to the vessel and the horrible death of the crew.
Hey where is Dan? I just started rewatching again
Towards the end of the war, U-Boat crewman had a death rate of 75%, the highest of any war service sector. This was mostly due to rapid advancements in anti U-Boat technologies developed by the Allies, mostly the Americans and the Brits. The U-Boats were a deadly and effective means of destroying merchant ships in the early years of the war but quickly became obsolete and ended up being suicide machines... giant steel coffins for most who walked their structures.
Not a submarine. That's a U-Boot. They were mostly surface machines. A submarine is typically a vehicle that spends most of it's time submerged.
@The Slow Mo Guys can you collaborate with @Ordonance Lab? they got awesome licenses and explosives knowledge , and incredibly good ideas, they just dont have anywhere near the equipment you have , it would be awesome if you for example were to be able to film a mirror that is pointed at the cone of a shaped charge through a periscope, or show the spread of fragmentation of a Granade - or show the flight of a explosively formed projectile - possibly the shaping of a explosively formed penetrator ... and who doesnt like explosions? You might have some ideas yourself
This is kinda boring with you alone. Where’s the other funny guy?
You have a pro marketing ad, when during the video You are not sure if this  is done to show depth charges or to sell goPro's.
Hey. Can you do one where depth charge would be bellow the sub? It is supposed to be more dangerous to real ones.
The Slow Mo Guy*
sup jay, wheres bob?
Jesus Loves You
5:06  next unabomba?
For the curious; the model is that of a German type VII, although for whatever reason it's not complete.
"Underwater Model Submarine Explosion in Slow Mo" Clearly - interesting nonetheless
well done
Is that a German WW2 Submarine???
Where thr heck is dan
where did you get the u boat?
So you blow up a plastic model underwater? Hm.  Still cudos for the very interesting details of the explosion and, as an old plastic modeller, for actually finishing the build in the second part of the video. :) EDIT: after re-watching I fully approve. ^^
is it me or should this sub been metallic :D ie being a scale replica but from realistic materials
That was a very nice model sub. $400 worth at lease, from a model shop. What a shame it’s damage now. But, that’s was a fun video.
Das Boot hält das aus
barotraumra
Any chance you can tell us where you got the submarine model from or what model this is?
The thumbnail looked like a real submarine firing missiles...
sad uboat noises
Images spectaculaires certe, mais c'est dommage de casser cette maquette 🤔
Wow, looks fantastic 🙌
fun fact: A UBoat, despite its traditional exterior hull, actually had a second, pressurized, hull where the crew and ballast would be. This helped the submarine cut across the surface much better than its contemporaries without losing depth. It even acted to make the UBoats tougher than other nations submarines by allowing the shockwave to break on the outer hull without causing major damage to the pressure hull. The UBoat was however not very fast underwater however due to its surfacce-boat-like shape.  (Submarines are cool)
this is like old miniature model films
Given it’s a plastic model, how about a model sub built with the same material and support structure as the real thing. A steel tube with bulkheads inside. Would bring much different results.
nice
Beautiful! More content like this!
WASSERBOMBE!!!!
Did anyone see GAVIN?!
Nice german U boat from ww2
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
The tiny humans be like DEPTH CHARGE INCOMING
but why cut up a perfectly fine type VII c submarine model...
awsomeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
6:55 like indeed ^^
Do this but with some model warships, and sink them with torps
Gav!! finally I have found Gavin!!! Arthur will be so happy.
You should do shape charge in slowmo
where di you find the bomb?
Hats off to everyone who experienced that in real life, and friend or foe, I take this drink for the ones who found a violent end as a result.
isnt it weird you can sort of see such things, subliminally..?
Hey Gav... thats a real submarine. A brick is not a submarine right up until it hits the water... subaquatic. Sub.. marine.
A depth charge exploding over a submerged boat, will do little damage unless really close. Explode the charge under the sub, we'll have a totally different ballgame!.
Bad advertisement for bad cameras. Gopro cameras are overpriced junk. You can get cameras from amazon with twice the specs for half the cost, twice the battery life, etc and go pro locks you into their ecosystem requring you to be online. Other apps are better for editting, free and you can use them offline. STAY AWAY FROM GOPRO
Hope we can get Dan back soon
Reminds me of when we had practical effects in films...
is Dan dead? why i can't see Dan since months ago?
I can only imagine the horror of what WWII submariners experienced being depth charged by passing Destroyers. U-571 is one of the best submarine movies ever made that gives really awesome examples of how insanely terrifying and destructive depth charging is
it would be realy cool to see this with a model made out of metal
Part 2 idea for this could be finding a way to do this while the Sub was under high pressure.
SCHNELLER CHIEF TIEFER!
WOW! That was awesome. It would be even more interesting if the sub is hermetic, fill with air, and deeper so we can see the efects of preasure. Thanks for the show!
Model U-boat : God, what's my end? God : Depth charged for Youtube.
last explosion took the path of least resistance, therefore, it didn't cough, it just filled the air cavity created by the previous explosions.  Amazing video.
Extraordinary video of a underwater explosion 💥, done so simple and still so complex. 👍👍
poor u boat modle
interesting how there is a chance the pressure hull loses its watertight seal to vibration even if the paneling itself isnt breached. I wonder how accurate this is to the real scale and materials.
On the behalf of Youtube's sore excuse of an algorithm; I apologize to any Submariners watching this x3
U-96 moment
Video actually starts at 2:23. Welcome.
I have recycled a lot of aluminum cans and saved some pennies, guess I will buy a Phantom Flex4K camera.
go pro footage was awesome
omg  Gab looks homeless..
do you have a link to this submarine model as id quite like to get my hands on one.
He couldve made one iimpressive and catastrophic engagement if he put that Depth charge under the sub. Doesnt have to be directly under but just to the side, but under it makes for the greatest damage and would be the perfect depth charge drop. Thats what was aimed at with standard Depth charges irl
i need a small one in at least 1080p 16:9, it'll be for airsoft
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk9WyEfzWPg  I would like to see spherical hydroforming in slo mo please
"Crash, Bang, Hot, Wet, and Up..." The new types of quarks discovered in slo mo
In conclusion, everything looks great in slow motion
i think that the fact that this is a platisk model and the size make the test a little false  because you does not need for a depth charge to blow by hitting the submarine to sink or destroy it that would make it unusuable as a weapon but i think the fact that the model was a little dismantel is a good show of why you can have intact submarine that sunk beacause of depth charge
where is dan
Not a real sub there  quite expensive. . 😐☺😊😂😄
now you have my attention
What on earth are they using fir thise depth charges? Are they electronicaly ignited firecrackers?
Nice Model. German Type VIIC U-Boat.
absolutely brilliant stuff...  love your videos just wondering, where's silent Bob?
I bet this will impact some cgi somewhere to become better overall :D
7:42  Was your 2nd charge really water-logged, or did it get sliced pre-detonation by a piece of plastic there?
I know this video was a couple months ago.. and no idea if you folks still check comments that come in this late.    But if you accept a bit of constructive Criticism. Next time you do an experiment like this.. use a larger tank?  Im NOT saying this to be mean, or snarky, or anything of that nature. Purely from a 'science' point of view.  With the glass being so close, wouldn't it amplify the effect the sub is hit with more than it otherwise would be if there was a much larger gap between where the explosion happens and the 'wall' of the enclosure?  Water doesn't compress.. so having so little room for it to move on one side would force more of the explosion back the other directions.
This footage is more marvelous than most modern blockbusters vfx.
So, essentially you're trying to say: _The front fell off._ XD
You know what crew cgi, we shoudl put model makers on pedestals again and use these amazing cameras to shoot some movie scenes. Maybe in conjunction with cgi. Best of both worlds.
👍👍
The subs plastic?
I got my own hero 9 black about 4 days prior to the upload of this video
So interesting to see all that in extreme slow motion. It’s just another world.
Too bad, France has a bunch of unsold "Real Subs" :)
Entertaining but the narrow aquarium throws off everything, because the glass contains and reflects the shockwaves.  So the entire experiment is meaningless. Entertaining, but meaningless.  I know, like this comment.  Hahaha.
U-BOAT!!!!!!!!!!
Where is the other guy ??,?
سبحان الله وبحمده سبحان الله العظيم
U571 always had me wanting to see more depth-charges in slo mo!
Epic, could you do more explosions with models
The game "Inside" has a part in which you have to avoid a timed shockwave, and the shockwave makes the sound at 2:24 every time it hits. One of the coolest parts of the game, and even cooler knowing how the sound was likely made.
Do you wanna super slowmotion click the snail
I feel skipped on 10 frames per second
It’s another Universe! Quite literally! Fantastic footage, you are filming different Multiverses... incredible nice one guys! ✌️
Buy rc tank and shoot it with bullets to recreate tank shell pls
4:24 are my eyes deceiving me or is that a smoke ring???
thats a U Boat not a submarine
30sec of content, 9 min of talking
Where is dan?
ALAAAAARM
wow wow wow!
the five dangers -crash -bang -hot -wet -up
Where's that beard bro...!? , you look super cool in that beard....
I like GoPro. u need to add fake sound to this footage and music! That would be awesome and sell my dad.
What happend to Dan I haven't seen him in forever
Could be cool to see a video that simulate a POV of a fly 🪰 (they see the world slowed !!) and then made a format for each particular animal 😍
Now that I think about it, it surprises me how many years took GoPro (or any other action camera brand for that matter) to offer a sponsorship to this channel.
Up is the scariest situation I have ever heard 0:50
🔫
Gav Faison--charmed, I'm sure.
e
Great video
Imagine in real in Ww2.. Dramatic death.
Anyone know what submarine kit that is? I kind of want one now.
You should drop some firework mini red explosions.
The impolite ray socially stamp because gray arespectively disagree modulo a maddening comfort. sturdy, capricious snow
What region is that accent from?  So charming!
Please try with a real one 😂
Where can I get that submarine?
"crash, bang, hot, wet, and... up"
Dan?🥺
"We won't be using a real submarine, as they're quite expensive." Typical British understatement humor.
What happened the the other guy
SUB
Detecting multiple leviathan class lifeforms in the region...
Can you the  same but  with  a Camera inside the boat and the boat is filled with air
Where had Dan gone for this channel?
What's the info on that sub model though? :)
I know it's a bit unreasonable, but I was really disappointed when I found out it wasn't a real submarine 😔
5:10 Am I the only one who sees Albert Einstein’s face in the explosion
Why does gav look like Jay from Jay and silent Bob XD
2:24  its sounds like Godzila film
Ad for gopro?
Very cool.
you know.... if I were a special effects computer engineer, I would watch this channel constantly.
Why does gavin look like a high school stoner in this vidoe😂💀
Gav, allow me to recommend NVidia Broadcast to clean up the audio in situations like this. There's a super high pitched whine in the audio most noticeable after 6:20
No more Dan. :(
What is name of background music
Really rocking that late 90’s look today gavin.
I think the effect at 5:20 may not just be bits of powder, it might be a Raleigh Taylor instability caused by a lightweight gas colliding with a heavy liquid. It will naturally end up with a lumpy, spikey surface at the interface, even without any solid debris.
5:05 a piece of the casing distorts the expanding plume, and it looks like a giant glowing peach.
We need a camera inside that sub. U571 style!
Kursk be like
Wer did u get your submarine,  definitely will like to buy❤
Where is Dan?
8:14 a thing play with the playback speed on 0.25
Why does this remind me of Subnautica?
Is it just me or do these videos just seem calming and soothing?
gavin looks sick, like seriously ill
Pay attention to the smoke and it blows an o ring 4:23
4:24 just a little smoke ring going upwards
I was wondering, Does watching the playback of 28,500 Fps on YouTube’s playback speed of 0.25x make it 114,000 FPS?
After 5 years i finily find the channel  i use to wach
The thick dad arthroscopically spill because drop rationally hook but a dark bone. verdant, rapid clutch
Someone needs to break into gavs house and vandalize his coat by making the V into a Y.
8:07 😏
so uhhhhh. what happened to dan?
The lab coats were a good call back in the day. Otherwise this would have just been "Stoner dude puts explosives and half of a submarine miniature in his fish tank."
Pop a balloon underwater and film the inside please.
Awesome footage , specially the last one . Congrats
You guys should do more submarine model stuff like this with bigger charges or something similar this is Awsome!
*red alert intensifies*
Where's dan at or is he still not able to enter the USA   Edit:I forgot that he lives in Europe and that international travel is still prohibited by plane ;(
Crash Bang Wollop! What a video!
Nobody:  The neighbor setting off depth charges in the middle of the night:
Love the hair.
what'sub
wifi can't go thru water??
where you bought the model subs?
Amazing! Just watch 'Das Boot' and now I'm trying to find stories from people who have survived being depth charged
"Have I mentioned I love GoPros"
Kudos to whoever built that fish tank!
Where is the other slow mo guy?
Slo mo guy :(
Came here to see a real explosion, left with a disslike and set YouTube to never recommand me this channel again
Why buy an expensive camera when you can slow a YT video to 0.25 in the settings.
8:37 I think gavin was hungry... "subway"
"crash, bang, hot, wet, and up"
It’s crazy that this is reality the fact that this isn’t some fake imagery and you needed a crazy camera to capture it is amazing blows my mind
เรือดำน้ำลุงตู่
I think what makes it more devastating is  a sub is pressurized with air for the crews to breathe.  During the explosion of depth charge compressed the sub shell  inward along with the air. Then the implosion after  the explosion  from of the dept charge causes the shell of the sub then move outwrard towards the sub causing tremendous damage to the main structure of the sub. Then the shockwave travels faster through water adding more damage to the rivets and joints of the sub.  Theres actually a slowmo video on yt simulating what happens a grenade exploded on a pool while you are in it.  But instead of humans, they uses a balloon representing the lungs with air inside, That shows how the air compresses and decompresses during and after the explosion.
Shows why films should use models instead of cgi... you can get some amazing realistic effects!
Now all we need is to see a nuke/big explosion going off underwater in slow-mo
28.5k fps such a beautiful disaster
0:44 I can't believe it survived "up"
what an awesome job you do, every single video you guys make are fascinating. where's silent bob? 😂😂
Remember the time Dan shot a GoPro with a cannon?
Ironically enough this does show the entire purpose of depth charges quite well. While you were blowing the single depth charges I noticed that there was a lot of movement along the bridge, and the whole purpose of a depth charge is to weaken the exterior just enough for the immense pressure of water to overcome the rest of the internal pressure and break through the steel barrier. At least that's what I'm noticing here.
RIP GoPro that got smashed by a cannonball.
Slow Mo explosions are the best! WE NEED MORE!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Where is your AMAZING Beard!!
Did you even try to rescue any survivors?
By the thumbnail I genuinely thought he blew up a submarine
At 4:24 the smoke coming out created a little ring!
So are you not gonna mention the time Dan smashed one with a cannon ball?
I'm blown away (pun intended) that the aquarium survived. I used to use hydrocrackers to blow up aquariums. Feel like the charges you were using are more powerful.
Anyone else think Gavin's looking a little like Jay (Jay and Silent Bob)
cool
Where did you buy that u boat scale? It's huuugge
i need more underwater explosions like the one in han solo
I wanna see more models blow up. maybe try you could try recreating the blast that sent CV-6 Enterprise's forward elevator hundreds of feet into the air? and possibly include a bit of a history/backstory with it too... what? I like history. =]
It's crazy watching Gavin being a savant with frame rate and physics then watch him being a Neanderthal playing laso haha
My idiot brain legit thought you had somehow obtained a real submarine to explode lol This was still just as awesome!
zach can see and react down to the femtosecond
4:24 did you guys see the smoke ring?
My late father was involved as a postgraduate with research in this very field in Glasgow naval docks during the Second World War. That and degaussing against magnetic mines. Wonderful images.
So, is it just the slow-mo GUY now?
...up!
So thats how the Big Bang was created.
Gavin should try and find a way to release the original 4K slow-mo footage to us so we can see it in all it's glory without YouTube's compression algorithms messing it up
In the second explosion ther is a smoke ringe thst suddemly pops out
The five elements crash, bang, hot, wet, and up
u didn't seal that back of the sub, thus making the overall structure less rigid. Oh, science))
"Hi, I'm Cletus, this is the slow mo dudes"
Only makes it even more horrifying to imagine what people onboard submarines during WW1 and WW2 went through
Bruh, The Thumbnail Looks Like A Rocket.
Depth charges also sounded their part from inside a submarine, low rumbles/bangs that resonate for some many seconds as the pressure swells and bubbles burst
Gav, you definitely checked boat trader for a submarine didn’t you? I need a new GoPro. That 9 is so nice.
real submarines aren't very expensive, I'm sure there's a 10$ real submarine on ali express, just that it would take 350 years to get shipped
If you’re running out of ideas - do chemical reactions!  The periodic table would be a great base for a new series on YouTube 👏
i have to wonder how it would react in a bigger tank, where the shockwave isn't immediately slamming into the tank wall
Brilliant!
Where you purchase that model sub?. Or the brand please
RIP first sub so sad they're destroying the subs  they are model i guess and it takes a while to build
you remind me of fenriz from darkthrone
Have u maybe thought about putting a open electric current in a clear tub and see if anything happens with high voltage. And SAFELY put stuff in the tub and see what happens? See if anything gets cooked in slow mo?
Rip Pavel inn gta 5😔
wow..what happened if we blow up the same thing not in the water but confined vacuum space?
This is the best way to use your backyard
Watching this makes me remember about the Indonesian submarine that sunk recently
Thats why submarine hate depth charges
This hits different after KRI-402 Nanggala accident. RIP🙏
7:21 if you set speed on 0.25 you can see some bubbles on the side of the boat
https://fb.watch/5jND-8Mo7h/ slow mo this
So that's what's happened to Dakar, Kursk, San Juan, Cheonan, Nanggala, etc
1 week after deathcore
Why don't you put in any energy to include Dan? There are so many possibilities
Where's Silent Bob?
i thought they were gonna actually blow up a sub
this didn't age so well...
Where is your brother of arm ?
Philippians Seaman, RIP
everyone knows the most dangerous element  "UP"
Where is dan?
What if you took the same sub but did it in a bigger pole instead
Which submarine Model did you use?
It would be interesting to see something like this: https://youtu.be/a7WwrMgGTzo in slow motion. Specifically where the larger ball was shot
This is the most disgusting Gavin ever
I gotta watch Das Boot after that one.
FOOLS! SORRY, JUST SAYING! Reasoning behind this idea was that when we tested nuclear blasts on fleet submarines AT DEPTH THE CRUSHING PRESSURE IS WHAT WE WANT TO SEE! GO TO A POOL FOR GOD SAKE!
Oh nice, Gav looks like an elf now!
Too soon
How did I miss this in my news feed, it was soooo good
Can u guys do PistolShrimp super slow motion?
What inspired you to make such a poignant video!?
I think of u guys every time my chrome cast says "ready to watch"
It would have been more impressive using a more aggressive explosive, a pressurised tank (4 BAR), and a air filled submarine.  10/10 would be when there is even an inside camera But still a nice video
Nothing more iconic than a _German Type VII_ Submarine
IRL once the top comes of there is pretty much no escape for the crew
How were the mini depth charges made?
Now i can imagine how Kursk explodes. Terrifying...
@The Slow Mo Guys "Dynamites and Fish" Love From Philippines
Nice pool you have there
Reason I disliked it Bcz GoPro sponsored this video
Have you been to Indonesia recently?
Your videos have stopped appearing in my feed. What’s that about?
Dude i would love to know your GoPro settings.
Can i get the Aquarium, pls? 😅
5:46 _"I really wanna bust"_
how much do ur camera cost?
Sponsored by gopro. Remembers the one that was absolutely wrecked by a canon ball.

Hey sir, Please make a slow motion of photography speed lights.
you are's legends
If it's a rc submerine I am going to be so mad
Little did we know how timely this video would be. Until Indias submarine showed up again o.o
Iooo I'm
Where is Dan?
Missing Dan!!!
This is very disrespectful considering what happened to the Indonesia submarine please remove or at least give the money to help the family
Cool  Stuff 👍🏾
Props to yall you've been on YouTube for about 10 11 yrs and your still pushing this is why your my favorite YouTubers other ones took a big break when covid hit hope dan comes back soon
The test is nice to watch. But if you know that it must be a sunken submarine, in that every interior of the submarine is filled with water, it would not be realistic. Maybe it's a test of the GoPro camera after all?
What happened to dan
You didn't try it with a real submarine or did you? Rip
Well that didn't age well
How about a smlo mo shot of a flash bang?
This is really satisfying 😎😎😎
quarantine did blessings for gav ngl, he looks really good here 👀
Breaking the sound barrier in slow motion
Underwater mushroom cloud😂
What about that one time you sniped a gopro with a cannon lmao.
btw, the Phantom v2512 can apparently (according to vision research's website phantomhighspeed.com) do 675,200 FPS at a resolution of 128 x 64 i know the highest you guys have ever done is just over 343,000 FPS but i would like to see something at the highest speed this camera can go.
Please break a giant glass ball in super ultra mega uber high speed!!!
thank you
Why does Gavin look like he's a weed dealer in a early 2000's after school special
Can you try this in slowmo? To find out what's causing the cracks on the other side of glass sphere.  https://youtu.be/a7WwrMgGTzo
After recent news, this video seems like foreshadowing
La elah ela Allah  Try to close your mouth  : ))
hey do videos, it is good for you
I really want to make a submarine movie now
I wonder if this video had a sponsor.
What kind of explosive was used here?
Where’s Dan Gruchy?! 🤔
Film a woodpecker please.?
Jason Mewes became a scientist! Snootchy bootchy
Why did you shave your beard
just watched a video from Fireball tools youtube channel about ratchet straps and he recorded them in slowmo, that might be a cool idea for a video.

Gav buy some drones and crash them in slow motion! That would look sick 👀
Do sandpaper and the ball magnets in slow mo. Sand different things and see how it works. And  uild something and have a magnet rip the balls apart.

Wow, this video was badly timed 😬 (Indonesian Sub Tragedy just happened)
I’d be curious to see how chewing gum thrown out of a car at high speeds is ripped apart into those strands that stick to other cars!

If you could do a nature episode,  can you do super slow mo of very fast animals like a woodpecker busting into a tree, or a Cicada buzzing , a cricket chirping, etc...? Love your channel from the very start. Thanks mate!!
Who else watched this on 4/20 and thought gavs fit was quite suiting 🤣
Toy submarine... Be clear with your captions... Don't misguide people for more views.
Hey guys haven’t seen slow mo guys in a lot of time. Can someone tell me what happened to dan? Haven’t seen him in so many videos
The clipclap app Brought me Here
I left this channel alone for 1 year and gav be lookin like emo Jesus.
Excellent footage as always!👍👍👍👍
Depth charges!? (Laughs In hedgehog)
Great efforts brother.....❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️. You deserve more subscribers....❤️
Is it now just "the slow mo guy" or am I missing something?
4:56 Reminds me of the time Dan and Gav did the lip flaps in slow mo.
kool
Should've been an U-Boot/Boat ;-)
Where's the other guy?
The title says UNDERWATER submarine. I'm like "where else would you find a submarine"
Lonely Gavin hits different
Wow! Very cool stuff Guys!
shaved the beard!  :(
Please do some sol-mo video of a woodpecker. I saw this video and thought of it: https://youtu.be/YQ2wIOcO7aE
Tthe explosion is destruction but you show it as a artwork! That's wonderful !
You should do the butane rocket thing but instead you light the butane right before you flip the bottle because fire makes everything better
It would be awesome to see you detonate something filled with a magnetic metal in between a powerful magnet and a dummy. You could see if you can affect the damage inflicted on the dummy by increasing the power of the magnet, and it would probably look really cool.
Gav looks like hes going to try and sell me a dime bag with his big silent friend.
THIS IS THE ONLY HD CHANNEL ON YOUTUBE.
That's why depth charges were and are very effective against subs
gavin looks like a crack head with long hair and a beanie ngl
A blender in slow motion? could be interesting if you mix eggs or something lol
Where’s dan
Where's the other guy
Great experiment 👍
4:24 smoke ring
My kosatka two seconds after i bought it
I'm amazed that the aquarium survived that last explosion.
Slow motion idea:  Phantom on cable, pull it super fast through/along a waterfall.
I like the exterior shot for the second. That little smoke ring coming out long after everything else was epic.
“Underwater” “Submarine” “Explosion” Me: *Subnautica.*
Woah, when did Gavin join a punk rock band... Or so I assume... Either that, or he is a part time homeless guy.
Sorry gav, but destins video was a little cooler, higher budget tho
Make a new video again soon. you are so good at it
Right off the bat I'm a little upset that you guys didn't take into account the effect of the pressure when a sub is at a deeper depth. The pressure of depth charges were so much more intense at deeper depths. At this point it just seems like you guys wanted to make a video of some fire crackers in a fish tank. EDIT: After making it 3/4 way thru the video (thank god I have ad blocker on) It was clear that they made this video purely for gopro.
Do a nuclear bomb next pls. Thanks.
Crash, bang, hot, wet, and up. Wow what a resilient little bugger.
With all the stereotypes, imagine these guys being the Slow Mo Cinematographers for Zack Snyder lol
Do a laser rust cleaning in slow motion!!!
Can you do a magic sword? It’s a circle with a metal bard and you put a tooth pic and it looks like it goes through but it goes all the way around but stupid fast
Am I the only one wanting to see this retested in a pool?
Where is Dan, is he safe?
Destroy more military looking models,its such satisfaction watching how thry react to explosions..
Awesome :) but little sad that you re alone.
Have you used gunpowder for the charges? Try using semtex or some real explosives next time ;)
I love how you can tell who has had their brains broken by the media because they are too afraid to get their hair cut
Did you got hero 9?
Next: minature nukes, minitank fight, miniature (large model) ships
Can you do a Slow Mo beyblade burst battle
Were is dan?
It would be funny to see a solo video like this but it’s just Dan
where did you get the sub?

I have a question, what is the frame rate when recording in real time?
As a fellow quintessential Brit, I was making a brew this morning. Crazy sentence I know. Calm down. But I prepared it in a glass mug and when the milk hit the brewed brown leafy water, I thought; the Slow Mo Guys! I would love to see this. Please make it happen.
Where's Dan?
Ohhh
Hey Gav, maybe if you say "GoPro" like 19x more, then I'll buy one
how long are you growing your hair gav? im also growing my hair out and am around the same length as you
*positive comment*
Good vid
You guys could video firing a revolver, would be neat to see where the fire comes out from the gaps by the cylinder and such.
I miss your only friend, why can you do that to your friend ?
glad you didn't bust the tank, Amazing footage
Slowmo tuh kek gini bukan kek game sebelah epep burik
What happened to the other guy?
I enjoy your slow mo videos. Awesome. If I could possibly hand in a request: If you ever find yourselfs on a marine ship or military base that has a C-RAM installed, please film it while shooting 100 rounds within a few seconds. It's an insane sound and the function is really mind blowing.
I think you should definately do a kickstarter for a real sub. Heh partialy kidding. To make it cheaper you could do a section of hull that's pressurized and possibly with the help of some friends.
whats wrong with dan
Where's Dan??
Can you slow mo the breaking of a “prince ruperts drop” no one has a detailed video of those being shattered. Thanks
That ARRI M40 light is so powerful tho
This is the POV of a ww2 submarine operator
POV: WW2
Where's the other slow no guy ?
What happened to dan?
What happened to Dan
So Cool!!! Is the U.S. Navy going to ask for a copy to better analyze the affects?
Why u no make fun vids
Omg more videos like this
So is this just the slow mo guy channel now?
you should record space rocket launches
That was wicked! Love the Slow Mo Guys, the mini versions of big things and explosions are wonderful, looked like it does in the movies.
where is dan? without him the slow mo guys just seems, *incomplete.* btw petition for a slow mo guys tv programme or film
Can u guys do the same in some big swimming  pool so we  can see it little big and that depth charge wont stop in tje glass frame itself
How does smashing fake rubber glass compare to real glass?
Your videos are great but they ain't the same without our beloved Dan :(
I was if you were going to use waterproof fire crackers
I miss dan
That 28,500fps is the same effect that they used for the Star Wars: Solo movie when the train blew the mountain to smithereens.
I never to the notification for this >:(
Well that’s how deathstroke survived
You should do another video like this with a model surface ship vs a simulated torpedo.
lmao, don't forget having a GoPro being shot with a cannon, courtesy of Dan
Ohhhhhhhh! Nice! Great job getting sponsored by gopro wow
Gav looks like he would be in a metal band
At first glance i thought this was a screenshot from subnautica.
Where's Dan? -- Under the sea / In an octopeagle's garden / In the shade
Just saying, if you didn’t know explosions underwater are twice as powerful than on land
What is normal to one is chaos to another!
Hey - where can I submit an idea for these guys?  I'd love to see some zoomed in slow-mo of water freezing instantly via hitting a bottle of ice cold water. Here's an example of what I'm talking about: Veritasium - Super cooled water [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph8xusY3GTM]  I think it would look super cool. Pun intended.
Now do this with a model of a tank
You need to tackle the phenomenon of 'FLYING RODS'.  Show them for what they TRULY ARE - please.
I would assume this video was sponsored by world of warships
Pleas recreated this practical detector and put it in slow motion https://www.facebook.com/theactionlabofficial/videos/347882316656686/
where is DAN?? :(
A good old reliable u boot.
Next video has got to be spinning an apple using compressed air until it explodes! Thats gotta be crazy!
I’m late to the party. What happen to the other guy?
Try filming Dan spitting out toothpaste from a height of about 18 feet. Brush to get lather then spit in a large drop.
Loved the slo-mo footage, but the GoPro Black 9 has some serious issues with it that mean it's not a great action camera. Popping noise from the audio, frequent lockups which require a battery removal, which isn't ideal if you are a whitewater kayaker like myself. It also has a terrible touch screen which makes it almost impossible to navigate the menu's and the final issue is poor and unreliable connectivity with the smartphone app. I think the best solution for the GoPro 9 is to just blow it up.
I would like to see you film very high speed bullets' hitting a piece of AR500 steel armor. A bullet moving at 4000 FPS like a 204 Ruger. Catching the bullet being destroyed should be amazing.
What was the ring of blue light just as the explosion reached the surface of the water?
I want a Go Pro now
Where is Gav and who is this and where is Dan ???
dude pls try to do an extrême slow mo on sprites, as the other one on the lightning was amazing i think getting one slow motion on that event could be beautiful
How about trying many charges vs 1 sub maybe that will be cool and maybe have a beautiful shot
Slowmo laser
omg i remember the the first video i ever watched was your  world biggest water balloon video i cnat believe your still doing this
now it's just slow mo guy
On the second one the smoke made a smoke ring
Hey guys, i'm a graphic artist and tarpaulin machine operator. I am wondering what happens under the head of a tarp machine printer head.
Please do a pimple pop close up🤮😂
That was wicked cool. @slowmoguys #slowmoguys
2 HAMMERS SLOWMOTION!!!!!
I’m slow so can someone explain where Dan is?
Za Warudo Stop Time 8:28
I agree, up is *very* dangerous.
not a terribly accurate showcasing since the shockwave will bounce right off the glass and back at the sub
Gav and Silent Dan - The High Guys.
Jesus Loves You don't let anyone down grade you. He says to love yourself and to love others as you love yourself. "I am fearfully and wonderfully made" Psalm 139:14
U guys should shoot nerf guns in slow mo
Where's Silent Bob?
Bro! This is Scam 🥴🙃
I think you should do a slap chop
Yo gav hats make you go bald by the by
Hi
Was anybody else expecting the glass of the tank to shatter immedietely?
5:36 a quick heart :)
Well done losing the beard.
Wow
This is amazing here's a wierd idea gaz and Dan I would like to see if a book could really stop a bullet in slow motion or other things depending on how far away you shoot always wondered if a book could really save your life by stopping a bullet and also I think it would be awesome to see in slow mo if it worked if not it'll still look pretty cool like how thick would the book have to be or how close or far would you have to shoot from for it to get stuck or rip straight through 🤔👌
I have not watch you guys in a year or 2
Something to remember when watching this is how the sailors who crewed these subs died. When the submarine's hull is breached the air inside is compressed by the inrush of water and it ignites. This caused the crew that lived through the initial attack to be burned alive before the water has a chance to drown them.
That's disappointing. A plastic sub and some homemade fireworks.   Someone should recreate a scale metal sub and charges that damage it like real life charges or torpedoes would....
got one  for you to film:  Construction of spherical tanks by explosive method. Explosive Hydroforming
6:35
He looks like yub
5:40 thats some movie scenes right there lol
Kursk moment
Crash! Bang! Hot! Wet!  Up! GOOO SLOWMO! By these powers combined, he is Captain Slowmo!
How did u do the charges? Did you buy them or made them by yourself? I would love to know and recreate that!
could you guys please do like a full scale car test crash video? with like crash tests at 60 100 120 km/h? I'd really enjoy that
I would love to see slow mo shots of various woodworking (or metalworking) equipment. A planer or jointer, table saw, miter saw, band saw, lathe, etc. I’ve seen some fairly slow shots of metal lathes, mills, etc. but would also be cool to see that shot with Gav’s eye for detail.
This is such a great technique to shoot a VFX shot, too.
Gav an Silent Dan
If it isn't too gruesome, I would like to see a slow motion episode on insect impacts on a windshield.
Hellow . I want create a video for gaming with your Gopro
Slow mo guy
Me seeing the sub for the first time: Should that be a German VII C submarine? Very bad recreation! Me seeing 5:51: Nevermind  ....
Tap here if you thought it was real
I am allergic to the blast radius of depth charges!
Just a suggestion. Would love to see a hand gernade exploding inside bulletproof glass chamber. Do think about it
Do Bioluminescent algae please!
Hey, gav you should go back to spinning a cd disc at high speed but instead offset the hole and record what happens in slow motion
Gonna watch u571 now
llama
Plz oh plz spin an apple in mid air with an air compressor until it explodes and film it. Or film a shooting star it that’s even possible
Ever thought of making a movie  studio
As cool as all your videos are, still, my favorite video, is the dragon fly eating the bug
Where’s Dan?
did anyone else but me se that smoke ring at 4:24
This is why miniature practical visual effects look so much better than CGI.
great video i’ve been watching for years. where is dan lol
اذا كنت عربي شترك بقناتي ❤️
John Lennon having fun with his 'Yellow Submarine'
I wonder why extremely high framerates in real life footage cause slo-mo, but when you play a game in thousands of fps, it does not. Its just super fluid and smooth.
Casual reminder that gav is a stalker
That’s all “creators” care about are the thumbnails.
So, when are you shooting the sequel to Das Boot?
8:27 the camera thought that shot was pretty dank
its crazy how to standard of youtube video have grown so ridiculous I expected a real submarine!
Do hydroforming at some point
Yes join the quarantine hair gang
Where’s dan
Nxt video sodium metal vs submarine
Why does gavin look like my high school drug dealer now
Are you the new Jay for Jay and silent Bob?
How did you guys not include the clip where you hit a up a go pro with a canon ball in the intro?
They should do one on the speed of the dark
Would be cool to see it with a sub model that was actually waterproof
ALARM! 🚨
Please make a video on PLT line
I respect this soo much!  Nice effects.
4:24 a little smoke ring puff out and the timing too lmao
Didn't you smoke a go pro with an arrow?
Really want him to reply cause my last name is also free and the only other frees my family meet were an old couple on vacation :(
Check out the spitting spider 🙏🏻
Can you make a slow mo of evaporation of water on hot pan
So... Where's Dan? I haen't watched full videos in a while, so I'm a bit behind, sorry
Crash Bang Hot Wet Up Long ago the 5 nations lived in harmony...
Yeo blow a bubble while chewing gum until it pops in slow mo
Bruh how ar you making 100000 fps
Love from india , Kerala !!
You guys should do a slow mo of a small engine on a lawnmower blowing up run it with no oil
Ok fr tho how did he make those depth charges 👀
Love gav's new look. But I had an idea. What if you filmed glass breaking again. But super up close with the probe lense. I feel like that would look awesome.
were is dan
do slow mo bacugan toy
Where is Dan?
what about explosion in closed water tank filled with water
have you done some images of a fuel injector?
Youtubing teaches you filmography. Lol
Oh god who gave gav the rank of captain
Is that sub a german WWII model? As I know, these waterbombs were the biggest danger if they exploded under the subs, cause the shockwave had less resistance traveling up, through the sub.
Wonder if you could do a similar exercise with the submarine but sink it below implosion depth and film that from exterior and interior.
Let’s not forget the the time they shot a cannon ball at a Gopro and destroyed it
Hi Gav and Dan. Love your channel. Can you do some slo-mo filming in 3D for Oculus Quest. I'd love to "explore" the Slo-Mo environment in VR!
spherical tank contstruction by explosives in slow mooooooooooooo
Does anyone know what happened to Dan
I want to see hydroforming a steel sphere in slowmo
You guys should do a collab with Demolition Ranch
Coolbeens
Who else needs a slow Mo video of SUPERSONIC BOOM??
Do a slow Mo video of supersonic boom
Wow, Gav back without the beard. I'm back to fancying him again.
just bought my 3rd gopro thanks to this video
There's a problem with this: water pressure is not the same as it would be for a real WW2 sub, which would be diving at somewhere between 80m and 200m
Gav, We love you. Get a haircut. I just cut off the pandemic growth that I should have gotten cut off months ago but procrastinating had me constantly putting off
Looks like nuclear bomb explosion.
You guys need to have a dedicated vlog channel.
Students: “underwater explosion” English Teachers: “2:53”
*Slo mo ideas:* 1. Slo mo battle some beyblades 2. Slo mo a pro vaper doing smoke tricks
Underwater subarine, surface boat
Dan should be hold the sub... Or at least put him in the fish tank... Were is dan Btw?
Look at his hair😂
Starts at 2:25 The stuff prior is long intro
*I definitly expected a real submarine!*
Getting a Jay and Silent Bob in 1945 vibe
If you read "Das Boot", they werent not worried (still a bit) by overhead explosion but rather the ones happening right below the keel of the sub !  Why ? Because under the keel explosion shockwave would have "lifted" the hull and broke it while explosion above or on sides of would have simply "pushed" the sub The captain explains it in the book..
They should now do a torpedo hitting, a battle ship or a bomb hitting it on impact
5:00 there’s sort of a face forming at the center. Really neat!
You forgot "Boom" and "Bye".
"It did a Dan good job!"
Nuuuooo the beard!
унлайк бикоз нот риал субмарин
Explosions without Dan?  Is that allowed?
Crash, Bang, Hot, Wet, and...... Up.
Omg gav grew his hair
Why was the video 50fps and not 60? just wondering
Oh you guys need to fly to Iceland right now!!! Get a slow mow of the active volcano!!! Would be spectacular!!! 🌋🌋
The most dangerous situation, up.
Das boot
This is how it feels to be in an Type VII U-boat in WW2 I bet our German grandfathers most have feel terrible in that 200m deep underwater casket ⚰️
4:24 ... kyle: "yea I vape" Slowmoguys: "ok but can you blow O rings from under water
Where’s Dan been?? Anyone know?
Super!)))
Honestly I'm just saying please try this on the best slow motion you have because because it's moving so fast I don't think you have the cameraI don't think you have it Euler's Dise
@slowmoguys we want to see a structure implode like they do in the movies .
Hello from Honduras Gavin!!  Hey l got a challenge for your camera.  Try to film a cat falling on shallow water, there is no way you can film that!!  Cheers!
Petition to have Gav do a whole video in his Texan outfit.
Please for the love of God cut that hair
We need Dan who should have taken care of the demolition....
On the subject of explosives and water, I would LOVE to see you guys look into recording explosive hydro forming (Just search YT for 'explosive sphere hydroforming')
A 6 day old Slow Mo Guys video hasn't got a million views yet? :/ Yet some bored housewife gets an insta 2M opening her kids' new toys. Where is the justice, hmm?
What about a space explosion
You finally shaved 👌.
Oh, Bro... I do miss Dan a lot
your hair is glorious
Kinda clickbait ngl
7:05 it's look's like the water  when it explode (implode) the water bounced 2.54 C.M.
This is why practical special effects in many cases look so much better than their CGI counterparts. Give me a good looking model and a real explosion over a CGI one anyday.
I wonder if you guys used a high explosive charge or low explosive? Since depth charges (if im correct) are based on high explosives? Really curious about this :)   Great video nonetheless!
Another great episode of Gav and Salient Dan, snoogins
How could u forget when Dan shot a go pro with a cannonball? 🤣 thats my fav SMG moment ever
Y did i think he was going to explode a real sub
I like this crazy things XD Greetings from Costa Rica!
Yall should get a large tank with a realistic downsized aluminum sub that has compartments and is airtight so we can see what the decompression looks like
OK, so now we're just expecting Dan to show up looking like Silent Bob, please.
How did that fish tank not explode?  With the blow-up swimming pool around the floor I was really hoping it would.  Clearly your depth charges were not big enough.  Tough fish tank....
Where did Dan go?
Tbh gopro 240fps videos put into slow motion AIs to get to 1000fps works alright.
When did Jay take over Slow Mo Guys? And where is Silent Bob?
This video makes me wonder if gav could do a video showing electricity moving through water. Could be pretty cool.
When Dan comes back could we see another super slow show?
Golf swing in slow mo??
Slow mo Jay and Silent Bob!
Mullet
I'm sad that this go pro has more fps than my xbox
Where's Silent Bob?
4:15 . Love that the frame rate of the studio camera matches the rpm of the cooling fans in the phantom.
GoPro panicking after all the InstaCam360 sponsored videos
you should do slo mo bullet impacts
So what is the speed of push? 🤔
Barb would love that pun at the end.
Where is Dan?
Gavin is looking a lot like Jay in this video, from the movie Jay and silent bob strike back if you didn't know.
I would like to see more of these scalled down videos of explosions like this. Very interesting to see how explosives affect vessels in water
Is there a promo code for the GoPro? I went to the link in the description and the prices were all the same as the regular site.
Can we at least get a reaction video from Dan?  Maybe have him video-call in during the shoot, and you guys watch the footage together.  Gav is great, but the Slow Mo Guy just isn't the same.
What happened to Dan?
Wheres dan?
The moment you add the word "explosion" to a Youtube video, it gains a million more views
I thought lockdown hit me hard.... #prayforgav
The second cheese thirdly prevent because playground hepatosplenomegaly breathe pace a regular capricorn. obnoxious, terrible carpenter
This whole video was a go pro ad when the entire series already was, though atleast it's gavin friendly
Where is Dan ?
Where is Dan? Actually
is that a model of a type VIIc U boat?
This is a long go pro commercial
nooo  the beautiful U-bot     :(
Love this always wondered what it would look like and great choice for your u-boot
This channel isn't as good with just the one dude.
you guys literally made a whole film here
Lovely Footage... Just wow!!!
You guys seriously need to show this in very slow motion for your next video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96yhdnhPxAw  Your welcome.
This was a blast!
I miss Dan :(
I would love to see that with an not sawed of u-boat
Sad to say but this seemed like little more than an advert. The sub wasn't even airtight. Could have put a gopro inside an airtight one and seen the explosion, that is the benefit of a gopro. The more i think about it the more i realise it wasn't even a good advert as he showed that he was able to get the shot with real cameras. Why wouldn't you show a shot that other cameras cant get.
Please do this kind of thing with legos
Why is a GoPro not waterproof on its own?
me: "cool" Germans: *SAD WOLF NOISES* British: *HAPPY ROYAL NAVY NOISES*
It's not the Slow Mo Guys(<<<Plural..............) without Dan.
its just the slow mo guy now missing dan
I realize the the cameras are rated to a water depth, but how does that translate to water pressure and how do explosions in water relate to water pressure? Do you in that fraction of a second exceed the depth rating by the camera? And if so, by how much?
I totally doubted the fish tank was going to survive.
Thank you very much, this video is very useful for filmmakers
Gonna have to rename the channel Slow Mo Guy :(
"Not a real submarine, they're quite expensive."  QUITE!!!!!!
' look alike the hunt for red october in the movie
Gav looks like Jay from Jay & Silent Bob here, lol.
Don't depth charges detonate below subs instead of right next to them?
Have Dan in the video on Zoom call...?
subnautica
If I may request looking into some medical devices? I'm currently in school about to enter the medical field and some of the equipment I'm learning about are really interesting. It'd be cool to see some of them working in slow motion if it's possible!
This video felt like a long GoPro commercial
4:23 love the little smoke ring coming off the water tank
I've missed Dan for a while now. Did something happen that prevents him from being a part of the channel?
My guy Gav looking groovy, what have I missed in couple of years..
What was the blue ring at the top of the blast
Outstanding!
Feel being april fool when thumbnail make u high expectations the submarine was real ~
i loved the little smoke ring at 4:25
Totally AWESOME....Thanks...WOW...!
Make Slow Mo for that https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwSJwzE7lAg
Where did you find the submarine that you did use?
Not a physics expert, but is this actually representative for a real life submarine? Would things like surface tension and traveling speed of the shockwave change relative to the size?
Same experiment but with a large pool? Would the sub react differently without the energy of the explosion bouncing off of the very close container and back onto the sub?
You guys need to do ferrofluid
You are missing two important points here - one is that the submarine would be at depth and the water pressure is relative to (RHO x G x H)  and is a factor on the detonation effects,  the other -and more important in my view , is that there are between 50 and 100 human beings on a submarine and a depth charge gives them  no chance. If they are forced to sink to crush depths, then at the point of implosion, the Diesel Effect will incinerate all on board before the water gets them.  You can look at this in two ways - one , that the "heroic submarines stopped the enemy resupplying their war effort" - or two - "the cowardly submarines slunk in to pick off the weak and slow freighters"  The difference is that the Victors write the History books.
Gav with no beard and long hair looks like he and Dan could cosplay Jay and Silent Bob
Hey Dan, just watched a video and thought how great it would be if it got you guys touch.  https://youtu.be/96yhdnhPxAw
I feel like this is a subtle threat towards Smarter Every Day
Where’s Dan?
Gavin: I think a slo-mo of this would be interesting. Hope you agree. https://youtu.be/xlzIUKyA1eQ
Guy: I'm going to blow up this boat!!!  Other guy: Wait, don't do it! **Puts the camera** Other guy: Okay, do it
Hot, blast, wet, and one of the most deadly filming environments... "up"
PaRapper the Slow Mo guy.
Gavin slowly turning into a goblin, or in this case, a gavlin
I miss Dan:( Thanks for the videos Gav
Should have bought a Mon Calamari cruiser.
I wonder if the force of the implosion stifled that depth charge
Please let Meg glam your hair for a slow mo hair flip!?
Ur vid forced my phone into high res and wasted my data. Cool vid but.
You should turn a air filled cup over under water
Please do some rapid bullet shots in slow motion
last i saw you your hair was on ur face lmao. I guess it migrated
Hmm. The  offer shown at the end says a HERO9 bundle with 64GB card for USD 349. When I key in that URL from Singapore, I get offered the same with a 32GB card for SGD540 which is USD 400.  But what is more, I get the *exact same* offer without the 'slowmoguys' link, so there is no savings that this offers.
legendas automáticas, por favor !
Change the channel name to Slo Mo Guy
you look a little like Bill or Ben the flower pot men with no beard, i just look homeless
8:27 a nice earrape effect from charges
Can you do a slo-mo video of the world ending by meteor?
sir where were u all these days no slow mo video ?
Bit click bait
Crash, Bang, Hot, Wet and Up. Definitely want that on a T Shirt.
Remember kids... being near an explosion on land is far better than being near one under water!
That Gav on the Smock can look rather different at certain angles.
Alaaaaaaaarm! Fluten!
Where is dan ???
the moment I saw him I was like WHO ARE YOU?
Bro grow beard you look like a different person right now. Or is it a oath till dan doesn't come back
@rcsubguy winces
Please grow back the beard and cut your hair.  This just doesn't look good 🙈🙈🙈
The isolation has made Gav a hobo
To SloMoGuys,                  Marvelously Done.
It's so satisfying 😌😌
Miss Dan
Just watched "das boot" yesterday. Very cool to see such detailed explosions and what it does too the sub.
"That death charge coughed"...things I never thought I'd hear someone say
the real slow mo here is the pace at which you publish the videos lol
Ready the photon torpedoes Skotty? Aye aye captain !  FIRE ! --- -- -- -- ---> 💥💥💥
Wow ! Ladies and gentlemen ! Shaved like a baby ! Ok almost ! 😊😁
When did Gavin become a member of an 80's rock band?
would you slowmo a violin/piano string snapping?
this model should have been water tight so it would have imploded
I miss “Hello I’m Gav, and I’m Dan.”
I miss the classic Gav and Dan together :'( :'(
I love ya even though you r a leftist limey
I miss Dan. 😢 just not the same without him. When is he coming back?
He looks absolutely cheesed
This guy's job is filming himself filming other stuff. Very meta.
Awesome video and great sponspr deal! :3
Better than the visual effects for The Hunt for Red October. Way better than Das Boot.
Where the F is Dan? haha
Kyle Hill just informed me this is called a "restricted waterway" causing weird fluid dynamics. Also, why isn't Evergreen written on the side, looks like it could've been a great solution that problem. Also, also, when are we gonna get a "Dan reacts" video of the slowmo happening in his absence?
I think Gav is going through a phase... the beanie and long hair...
Who else puts their video at 0.25X speed lol
I think you also hit a gopro with a freaking cannonball
Where is Dan gone?
Were is dan??? I've been gone for a while!
“crash, bang, hot, wet, and up.” Kinda like rocket science.
Im thinking bigger
Try to slomo tesla coils while they are on
Underwater fire.  Cool.
You forgot to mention that Dan once shot your GoPro with a Canon ...
"This side???" That's the starboard side - just in case you were wondering? :-)
No ragrets
Im an Idiot to think he was going to use a real one, Like with decommissioned sub to be tured into an artificial reef
Hold on, weren't you going to keep the beard until the pandemic was over? 😮
Playing slow mo guys on 0.25x speed = genius
Hook up with SpaceX and get the next launch and potential crash in slow mo yooooo
As much as I love this, it's not even in the same ball park in terms of science. The damage comes from the sub being full of compressible air on the inside, this thing is full of water, preventing the hill collapsing (forgetting that there is a hole cut out the front) it would be great to see this done again with the sub full of air. It would be quite spectacular I think!
Gavin if you see this can you please record an epipen in ballistics gel please?
I'd like to see a log split from an ax or whatever, how the grain of the wood cracks. It sounds simple, but I don't know how you could picture it in an interesting way :)
Miss dan
This is the maddest and coolest experiment ever, such great info from the footage. Thanks
I really hope that once Dan is able to film with Gav again, they introduce him emerging from a hole in the ground where he's been digging his way towards Gav this whole time. That'd be absolutely class.
Sir make a slow motion of  small flying insects like honey bees and moths...
One of these days, I’d like you and Dan to play two characters in a Thomas the Tank Engine thing I’m making. You can be Edward’s driver and Dan can be Edward’s fireman!
https://youtu.be/QWkMtzM_r2M
5:25 is that a spaceship passing near a star going supernova?
boring without dan
I like your hair long gav
Wasn't expecting the GoPro to do that much but the footage was ok!
for anyone wondering what kind of submarine that is, it looks like a german type 21 uboat from ww2. I believe the type 21 was only used near the end of the war
The phrase "Not a real submarine, they're quite expensive" makes me almost think that Gavin tried to buy a real submarine for this
That last detonation caused cavitation to appear between the glass and water in a large area.
Gav Proskater
Slow Mo Bow show? where you record different bows releasing their arrows. including a homemade bow? and the Japanese bow?
where's Dan?
Cool “O” ring at 4:20 😏
0:59 It seems the front fell off. Must have hit a wave...
The useless shop parallely blink because pond alternately snore atop a anxious newsprint. dark, melodic june
i'm completely obsessed with the reflections on the insides of the fish tank and on the bottom of the water surface
Picture of the sub with the word scribe next to it. I laughed a little too hard at that. Nice touch Gav
Bigger pool and torpedos next time👍 Awesome sauce 🥽
gav looks a bit like jake gyllenhaal lmao
THIS IS U-571 -- DESTROY ME!
You should put patterned like paper towel on colourful ink I seen someone do it an I think it would look even cooler in slow motion
At depth, the real danger is one exploding under the ship.
What brand of Uboat model was that?
200fps and you call it slow-mo? Not really, not these days mate. Shame on you cheesy cabbages . . .
Gav is starting to lose his British accent
Need to do more with explosions/reactions on objects, I wish these videos never ended honestly.
gav should film his hair in slow mo, like a shampoo commercial as his hair is long and well looked after 😂😂
GoPro is too expensive nowadays. Just use your phone and get better footage.
I kinda want a sub made of aluminum or something so it looks like a real one as it gets hit
I'm the like number 53.000 ( ~∆~)b nice and clean. :r
We miss dan
2:31 thank me later
WHERE IS DAN
Where is Dan?! I wanna see Slow Mo Guys, not Slow Mo Guy. Or Slow Mo Bro.
Were is ur partner
This makes me think about the book thunder below
His nose is huge
Speaking about GoPros, didn't they shot a cannon ball straight at it by coincidence?
😕😢https://youtu.be/t343WgaaTgA
This is epic!!!!!
Crash, bang, hot, wet, and UP That is quite a selection of categories going on lol
where is dan?... don't get me wrong gav.... u are coool but dan is awesome!
4:20 - Nice little smoke ring from the surface there... lol smoke ring... 420... lol
Grow it back!
I used to not want to go on a submarine.  I still don't.
you should make a death star version
Could have used your help over there in the Suez...
shinji from persona 3 blows up a submarine in slow motion
The built in mount clips started with the Hero8. The only difference between an 8 and 9 is that the 9 Has a color front screen that can show you what the camera is recording.
8:40 Was that “Subway”?
I've always loved the look of the Diesel Submarines
Dan in 2035: The End of Planet Earth in Slow Mo - The Slow Mo Guys
Would it be possible to have a parascope connected to the phantom going into the water
4:44 Tenet vibes
The crater like spots as the cavitation bubble collapses is pretty interesting.
What powder did you use ?
Im surprised that the tank survived
Gav looks like he has reverse aged
I was slightly disappointed to not see the shot of the GoPro getting obliterated by the cannonball when Gavin was talking about how he’s used the GoPros before
I watch slowmoguys videos in 144p
Is it just me that expect a real sub? Anyone...?
‘Sub’scribe
We miss Dan!!!!!
This GOPRO advert was a bit cringey, ngl
"Buying submarines online is hard" ~Gav 2021   First world problems
4:25 smoke blows a little O
Gav and Tommy Fleetwood could vibe because of their hair alone
Long hair does not suit you 😳
It would've been great if you could have put that charge below the submarine keel, that's the point of maximum damage. Then you could've watched the sub lift up and split in half. Oh well maybe next time. :-)
I love ww2 and explosions sooooo...
Where's Silent Bob?
Mate, it's our job to find the thumbnail!
Who's this new guy without a beard???
I thought they would show the scene where they broke a camera with a cannon
‘8a.
Hello from Bosnia and Hercegovina ...pozz ppn vitezovi
The last test, it appeared that the first explosion sucked the exterior depth charge INTO the sub.
Pretty cool video Thanks for sharing ^_^ . . . . . . . . . You should be using kerosene or alcohol instead of water due to the size of your experiment. It would certainly be more dangerous, but the codings would be closer to the real size.
Tidy aye :  )
Dangerous situation: UP
7:22. What was that? Seriously. That looked like a bubble formed on the outer area just below the black deapth charge and then just disappeared. Hiw did that happen? Can it be recreater
Why the waterproof housing, isn’t the 9 black already waterproof?
That was amazing..... DO MORE UNDERWATER STUFF!......      please
Thanks for the deal SlowMo Guys !! Just now ordered my first GoPro. Yes, the Hero9 Black. SO excited. Can't wait to plop it onto one of my two RC planes or one of my three RC cars !!
Glad to see we aren't just mentioning products anymore but rather just making the entire video about the sponsor. So now we just watch paid promotions, not actually content. Yes this is sarcasm.
Be cooler to see you do this with something like a metal biscuit tin for the sub and bladder in one.
🔥
This is so beautiful everybody should know how an real explosion looks like
That was pure awesomeness!!!👍👍💪 Please do more than 1 video a month at least 2 thanks!!!
Super dope
the Hero 8 had the new addition of that built in mount. i think it's one of the best ideas they ever came up with! those are also magnetic, when you're not using them, they fold up and are held in place by tiny magnets.
this guy has me name
can someone tell where dan went
A pandemic
Oh ye
Where’s Dan?
Nice smoke ring. 4:24
Where's silent Bob?
You should take a trip with the storm chasers and capture a tornado in slow motion
Why does gave look like a crackhead even more each video
I'm convinced we live in a pixelated world and this is all a simulation.
Always a treat when you release a new video, Gav.
This is amazing! Thank you for doing it.
i'm 80% sure that u used gunpowder so it didn't have that big of pop asi it shoud have. but still, really good video
Wheres Silent Bob?
Good sir Keep Going❣️❣️💋😍😍😍😍
Well we have Jay where is Silent Bob?
Me, an amateur intellectual: Gets 114,000 fps by slowing the playback speed to 0.25. At 2:46, try it.
I’m getting barotrauma vibes someone’s overloading the reactor
0:40 you forgot to mention the one Dan shot with a cannon
Who else thought it would be a real submarine
Where's tubby? What happened to tubby? I loved tubby for some reason
"The Slow Mo Guy"
Thats not the way a deph charge works
Let's be respectful of those that died in U-Boats and submarines during WW-II.  Put 45 men on-board the Type VII at 100 + meters getting depth charged in a similar manner to what you are demonstrating.   The instantaneous acceleration imparted to the hull and her occupants caused over-pressure failure of the structure, and physical injury to the crew.  If the damage to the hull caused partial flooding, then the lack of positive buoyancy would cause the boat to sink, eventually reaching the crush-depth of around 170 meters.  Once the hull imploded, death would be instantaneous.  The time leading up to that event would be minutes of abject terror - knowing  you are about to die.  20,000 Kreigsmarine sailors died in this fashion. Many thousands died in Allied submarine losses, mostly American.
I come back to this channel 2months later from gav from looking like thor to now looking like a surfer
Crash, bang, hot, wet, and... up. 🤣
Ъ
He looks like he’s in a metal band
Jay and silent bob?
As a lover of both submarines and slow motion, this had me smiling ear to ear :D
The Sub scribe joke at the end 🤣🤣🤣
We need a 'crash, bang, hot, wet and up' t-shirt.
God that's terrifying. The entire thing creeped me out for some reason. Still, a very well-made video :)
This is who you need to record! https://youtu.be/PNXElmEUIJo
Why this looks like subnautica
That long hair! And the beard gone! Makes you look younger.
I might be wrong, but it looks like the front fell off.
05:06 Did anyone else see a bright yellow face getting clearer and clearer as the explosion is continuing to, well, explode?
Daniel Gruchy, Daniel Gruchy, wherefore art thou, Daniel Gruchy?
4:34 thumbnail
Where is Daniel?
Oh look, 'The Slow Mo Guy'
The GoPro promotion in this was too much. I don't mind videos being sponsored if they're just mentioned at the start and the end, but he mentioned it so much in this video and it was really distracting
"I think I saw the thumbnail" 😂😂
The day u uploaded the video was my birthday.
Gav looks like he has taken up some new hobbies, such as skateboarding and smoking weed
Isnt there usually 2 guys? Where the other guy?
I was gonna ask for this specificly but here it is lol
Nice
3:42 on the right is what i think a supernova/star explosion would look like in space.
Nuke next time?
Reminiscing the achievements hunter days
Hey Guys, since you´ve made a video about the slowmo soundeffects, i´d love to see bits of these in every video you make.  i am really curious  of what silly ways you guys came up with to make/get these.
Students: “underwater explosion”  English Teachers: “2:53”
When you said, "bang" " crash" - I was expecting you to say "wallop! what a video".... anyone else get this?
Where is the slow-mo footage of the go-pro mounted at U-Boot? I mean last explosion. He mentioned that it was recorded with 200fps...and shows us normal speed... 🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️
My first thought was "The go-pro too is s submarine..."
now we have the thumbnail \o/
Gavin looks like he joined an idie rock band lol... Id buy the album
Me the entirety of the video: * having flashbacks of CoD MW3 *
The collapse of the bubble will never be very strong due to the fact that there is a great deal of gases remaining. Thus no second shockwave.
Hey Jay, were is silent Bob? 😅😉😘
Someday we'll hear Gav say "Not with a fake submarine because they're quite cheap, so we'll use the real deal."
So this video made me think of something horrific. With the shockwaves bouncing around keeping the air in for a bit, I assume this would also be true full scale, which means if a submarine gets breached by a toredo wouldnt the shockwaves insane cause massive damage the the crew and instruments? or is there something cleaver going on full scale to minimize this?
Dan better come back looking like Silent Bob
My father died on a submarine.  😳
Really nice
try again in an underwater pool say 10 meters deep, and use a rigid pressure vessel for the submarine not a bladder. would be a more devastating depth charge shot.
I notice he didn’t mention shooting a GoPro with a cannon.
why does Gavin look like a skater
Just waiting for usians NOT blowing sth up.
what about... a tiny cut in the finger in slow motion?
Was there supposed to be a discount of some sort on the new GoPro? 🤔
Whatever happened to Dan?
Do something with your hair ffs .. the Billy Ray Cyrus “Achy Breaky Heart” look died in the1980’s 🙄🤣
Some of this footage could for sure be used in movies like "Das Boot". Awesome!
Anyone else waiting for the clip of Dan annihilating the gopro with a cannonball?
Hey you should do eye drops hitting the eye
*Hey, to you reading* ..... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
What submarine did you buy? A few of us might want to buy one ourselves.
you gonna do hedge hog mortars next?
Obviously you couldn't afford a bigger fishtank.
I'm glad gopro sponsored this rather than squarespace or nord vpn.. which no one uses or cares about.
Watching a slow mo vid at .5 speed   I am 4 parallel universes ahead of you
Where is Dan???? And I think it’s time to lose the locks.
That's not a v2511, that's a v2512, where did you get that from gav.
8:14 - 8:26 this looks like a first person perspective of a diver in a movie or something
Thought it was a real submarine :c
why do you upload every month 😥
Would be cool to see this experiment in a larger tank of water so the glass wouldn’t be in play.
I like slow mo guy but I like slow mo guys more. RIP Dan 😭
Dan where are you
Tf happened to this channel
Love it.... 🤠👍
Thank you for sharing Gav! Loved this slo mo explosion 02:45
explosions underwater get "drawn" to any hard surface ..your blast is being "pulled" off to the side of the tank.    You need a wider tank  so there's at least a good several feet of space  (probably twice the width of this tank.....) There's a series of videos from the 60's or 70's that were an examination of explosive behavior underwater...
Sub-scribed nice. 👌🏼
How is it air in the bubble?
Jay? ...you really need silent bob back!
Thumbnail looks exactly like a rocket launch 🚀
you realize a non-pressurized sub underwater is like the same as any random piece of trash also in the water right? you might as well have exploded a can underwater   and I'd probably still watch it cause its dope af
There used to be two of them. 😢
I can’t imagine what it looks like inside the actual blast
Where you get that sub from?! Lol I want one
Gav why do you look like you're cosplaying Millie Ramsey?
You basically enabled HDR by using way too much light and a short exposure time.  I like it.
Remember, real subs aren't made of plastic that bounces back and depth charges would be used against subs that already had between 2 and 20 bar pressing down on them.
How about a mini nuke explosion? =D
What happened to the other guy
cool little smoke ring comes out of the water 4:24
Where’s Dan?
4:24 the smoke ring was cool.
scribed
Monke: wer dan
Gav, doing his best Jay (from Jay and silent Bob) impression.
I have a question that needs answered. Does an explosion quickly accelerate to a certain top speed and then slowly reduce it's velocity or is it born with it's top speed on ignition only to then slowly dissipate? Any suggestions are welcome. This one is really buggin me!
Need a finer powder.
I'd love to see this done again with better setup and maybe some navy specialists
He looks he is cosplaying a smart Jay from Jay and Silent Bob.
Interesting.  As a former Submariner I would be curious to see what the reaction on the boat would be if you hadn't placed the charges on the fairwater deck and had lowered the main depth charge to below the keel.  That might have produced a lifting and breaking of the boats' back.
My Newfy grandfather was in the royal navel in ww2 and did alot of this escorting  Logistic vessels from North America to England and between island and Greenland
Don’t forget about the GoPro that Dan shot with a cannon.
i hope im not missing info on dan, cause he seems to be missing for a while now?
I'm not the only one that thinks of the first explosion looks a bit suspicious right
I can watch in 2160p50
What model sub is  that?
Where did the lockdown beard go? Did it fall off?
Who’s the new chick?
Idk why I thought it would be a real submarine
I wish he would just get normal hair and financial hair
I wish
Gotta love how Gavin just looks like a randomized Sim in these latest videos. Long hair, beanie, lab coat, and shorts. Beard? Not this randomizer.
Gav looks like he's gotten younger.
We all know the different things that makeup danger, "Crash, Bang, Hot, Wet, and Up."
Do a slow - Mo of the world getting back to normal 😊 👍🏻... after Covid 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
04:24 that smoke ring is mega satisfying.  Also Gav you’ve definitely got a Jason Mewes (Jay and Silent Bob) look to you here
The weary parallelogram expectedly empty because cheetah syntactically concentrate outside a mean staircase. skillful, crowded peanut
8:50 you look like some rock star from 90s I hope you haven't started drugs, that what my grandma said when I looked like this in my 20s
Hey what happened to the other guy?!!
where is DAN????
the slow mo "guys" :(
Go pro this go pro that
Having spent a career in real submarines,  this has no actual value.  If it was to show reality the sub should be made of metal not plastic,  and a larger tank would be used to prevent the relective shock wave from the side of the tank.
Terrorists be taking notes right now
Pls oh god cut your hair
Hey Jay, how long until Silent Bob joins you in Texas?
I wonder who the sponsor was lmao
I didn't know Jason Mewes was making Slow-Mo videos now :-)
Mates, thanks for all of your videos, but I must unsubscribe to all channels, including yours, until YouTube reinstates Steven Crowder's channel and stops censoring free speech. #FightLikeHell
This is The Slow Mo Guy, not Guys!!!!
Вот так лодки тонуть не должны, Владимир Владимирович!
Get a haircut
You need your hair cut 😂
Gav and Dan are slowly transforming into Jay and Silent Bob
4:24 Ooo indeed, the bang agreed!
Bout time you guys posted a video
I really do love seeing Gav in this “Sid From Skins” cosplay.
Daniiiii where r u
4:24 a little smoke ring pops out after the detonation
Make a simulated submarine body from soda cans.  Then detonate charges in the water near it.
Oh my god I found your friend.......he's very worried
Why does he look like Scott Stahp with that hair
Where is dan
Love it !! You should do more videos like this 👏🏼👏🏼
Why is the Arri company name censored, you gopro shill?
Gavin's long hair looks so shiny and healthy 😍
4:36 Notice the little smoke ring that shot out the top of the tank. :)
I come back to the channel after a while and.....that haircut
I get the impression that Gav has been watching old Mythbusters videos.  "I didn't get the result I wanted so I'm going to just set explosives all over the place."
i didnt know jay and silent bob had a brother.
The slow mo guy
What happen to Dan can any1 tel me pls
All I can see is an add🤷🏼‍♂️
That’s sick!
0:01 Hi, I'm Jay, and sadly, my hetero Lifemate, Silent Bob won't be joining us today.
failure , no depth charge destroyed the sub,
Him and meg really went down
07:25  Exactly....not metal.
After the Snyder cut, I think I had enough of slow mo.
Some say that Dan went in to slow motion for too long and died of old age.
He looks like a disciple of Jay from Jay and Silent Bob
5:05 Did he just film the creation of the universe there?
Crash, bang, hot, wet, and up= dangerous
I love how he uses a german u-boat 😂😕
Anyone know what was up with the video preview
don't forget you shot a gopro with a cannon
Want to say, I was wrong, I thought the fish tank would have broke
Some submarines can carry up to 160 people. Crazy to think about it
When the sponsors won't let you talk about the time you shot their product with a cannon 😔
#35 on trending today 4/1/2021
How come you have gone to 50pfs now?
Gav looks like Phineas from Phineas and Ferb.
Hats off to a submarine crew. Im closterphobic and thats a horrible way to go out.
I hate to be that kind of person but that’s not a submarine so U-boat
Once we can get Gav and Dan together in person for another video, I'd definitely love to see more slo-mo underwater explosions... maybe Dan could get some more det cord and give us a lovely show.
This is actually so cool
"UP!!!!" haha love it
Toy ingredient for fun video
I miss you with your friend.
great april fool!!!!
Where is dan :(
That's a toy submarine, even not a prototype submarine
That sub is huge.  What kit is that.  Awesome effect.  The entire deck came up.
👌
Gav is looking more and more Garth from Wayne’s world
We miss dan😔
Part II, have the GoPro inside the cavitation bubble, no sub, and with bigger boom.
The https://youtu.be/5pQvM9ZY41k things to come
”Hi I’m Jay”  Missing Bob though.
How long have you been cosplaying as kid rock now Gavin?
Explosions.. Can we have submarine Implosion please?
brother, when I was a kid I smeared alcohol into a tube and turned it on, then blew it on, and I liked the effect it made like a movie, the fire towards a wall, it would be interesting to see it in slow motion
Am I the only one thinking Gav out here looking like a British Jay Mewes lmaoooo
I dont remember Gavs nose being so big 😂
What framerate screens do you use?
Where’s the other dude
Is that jay from jay and silent Bob
Best sponsor EVER.
Love seeing the bubble pulse in slow mo. Just like marine seismic exploration.
not gonna lie I was kind of expecting the tank to get blown out. :(
Super cool!
You’ve turned into an Australia surfer for some reason.
Do this with modern sub hull design please
Is that April Fools hair?!
thought this was the alterra from subnautica
SELL OUTTTT jk you bloody deserve it by now haha
The depth charge went off with full force but the water being drawn back in from the initial charges consumed the explosion. You can see the fireball through a small hole in the sub. It all blew up inside the sub.
Love GoPro!!
Is it just me or does the thumbnail reminds me of the Cyclops in subnatica
i was expecting an actual submarine, but this is good as well
Gav, my boy. Something you need to know. Having seen many WWII depth charge films by the Ministry of War (Navy). We see that the further away from the sub the better. The explosion should cause a vacuum that suddenly collapses the submarine as the water rushes back into the sub.  Do this again, but this time in a swimming pool.
Hey Gav, i understand you gotta get paid mate, but those GoPro shots look like rubbish
A nice product promo that isn't jarring af
It's April now, would you please slow mo some rain?  The water spraying out from the tank was just as lovely as the glitter a while back (was that over a year ago?!)
Whoa whoa whoa .. Dude, don't shave your beard anymore😬
Every time he says 'depth charge' I think he's saying 'death charge'
Nice trim Gav
Can I ask where Dan is?
I think that last charge wasn't waterlogged. The first charges bubble was collapsing so it was a low pressure zone. So when the second one went off its energy probably mostly went towards that zone. That is my guess.
When did Jason Mewes start hosting Slow Mow Guys vids?
Jason Mewes?
Gavin needs to do the next video in a track suit and with a scouse accent, the long hair and hat will just bring the whole look together.
More underwater/water surface slo-mo destruction please!!!
Idk if you've done this or not  But you should def do this again but with a huge Lego city!
What got me about the second explosion watching the seams ripple and shifting. That would have been devastation to the crew and ship. It would be a crew running about chunking loose seams turning valves down putting up wood braces
friend: how many frames can you get on youtube? me:28500fps
The beard is gone! O.O
maybe some Das boot movie music should be played.
Nice of you to shave your beard, now get a haircut.
6
I have this amazing idea about some direct printing !!! Only of I could get some high res pictures of the explosion... I have the printer in my hands and Im gonna giveaway a lot of shirts if you get to like the result.
Dan should just join over zoom call for the usual banter. Hey, he could even control the charges remotely, I’m sure! Guys figure it out, let’s put the “s” back in Slo Mo Guys!
*Now i dont wanna imagine what the real deal feels like*
What happened to Dan
Me watching this at 0.25
that hair and beanie makes you look like a chav
How do people "dislike" this video? Slow mo, Gav, submarine, explosions.......what more could you ask for.
Way to put our camera to the test, Gavin and team! We know that GoPro’s can withstand any BOOM our users throw at it, but seeing it in action is still pretty awesome.
I literally just watched The Hunt for Red October , Crimson Tide,  Below and U-571 within last month ... I am ready
"oh hello! In Gav, and in this lovely SlowMo video I will be placing a depth charge on a US submarine, and framing Russia to breathe life into world war 3"
You should've had a "mini-Dan" somewhere inside that submarine just to keep the tradition going of him being the "test subject". lol
Go pro even sponsors?!
Real talk, dying in a crushed submarine is one of the most horrific ways to die. The pressure of deep sea could crush the sub like a tin can, you could die of 02 deprivation (suffocate/drown), pressure blowing your brain out your ears, or the water pressure getting through a crack and cutting you in half like one of those water jet channels but scaled up.
How much is this camera? I’d like to know what I can’t afford.
I'm not wasting any time on these great slow mos untill you cut your bloody hair......
Surprised this video didn't get more views? Its really cool and fun.
You are starting to look like Jay from Jay & Silent Bob. Thumbs up!
This is the kind of slomo footage i love !!!!
It actually pooped out a smoke ring at 4:23 that got thrown around by the other smoke. Slowmo video for that next time? 😬
Wow, can you please tell me the make/model of that aquarium?  That was a lot of shock tolerance.  Great job on the video.
Tiny smoke ring at 4:24 Just above the stick.
I miss Dan.
This video was so epic you just gained a new subscriber!
Gav OnlyFans when?
Without Dan, Gav has just turned into a homeless scientist.
Imagine being a soldier in an actual submarine and the slo mo guys swim down 100ft just so they can blow it up and upload it on YouTube
omfg gav you look like your about to do another laser team acting with that hair
I REALLY wanted to see the whole Submarine explode!
Why does it feel like the slow mo guy channel is slowing dying
8:14 - looks like you definitely 'charged' your GoPro 🤣
Gavin over here looking like Jay lol   Where's silent Bob?
You sunk my battleship!
0:10  you don't say, submarines being expensive XD, fun fact there are more planes in the ocean than submarines in the sky, look it up.  Also 0:40, if your familiar with the Dudesons, i don't remember which of them said, ''when your old you don't want to think about the things you didn't do, you want to remember the things you did'', i think Gavin exemplify's this extremely well with all the stuff he has done, even with the stuff he hasn't filmed and shown, just a plethora of multitude of rich and interesting things.
90s skater Gav aint real he cant hurt you  90s skater Gav - つ◕ل͜◕)つ
hey guys its gavin... 👉or xgav welcome back to the channel. hope everyones having yourselves a snazzy day
Whare dan?
Not the same without the two of you together............
Slow mo guy
Gav is reminding me of every 17 year old boy in the 2010s
I wonder how much of a difference it would have made it putting the depth-charge under the sub? =)
That's awesome 👌
Thanks for the video you jay and silent bob looking slow-mo guy.
I miss your videos
This is mean to be the "slow mo guys" right? Where's the other dude?
I understand that a full sized, real submarine is expensive and it's understandable that you couldn't afford one for this video.  *But there's always next time.*
The Slow Mo Guys once again prove the power of the Physicist aesthetic.
Beautiful as usual , good job gav.
Next time you need a real submarine
Imagine if Thunderbirds was filmed at this speed.
Thats one tough aquarium!
Gav looks like a guitarist in a band who's fans are predominantly 13 year old girls.
things that gopros can withstand: 1. Crash 2. Bang 3. Hot 4. Wet 5. Up   what more can you ask for
SLO MO pimple pop ?
3:00
Explosions in slo-mo look like galaxies in space... what would space look like sped up??
What's the progress with Gav getting a haircut?
I hope Dan comes back soon🥺🥺
I remember reading from somewhere I don't remember, that a depth charge that went too far down did the most damage to subs.  The blast of the gas bubble slamming from underneath and the sub unable to move was just brutal.  Would have been neat to see that in slow mo
Slow-Mo Sk8rs for life!  Well, ever since they got Tony Hawks in.
You didn't mention how you shot a gopro with a cannon? I think that was the only real on screen death we have seen in your show (yet).
82ND AIRBORNE DIVISION GENERAL JIM GAVIN 1/16/1946 PARADE 5TH AVENUE NEW YORK CITY,NY
You brought the battleship boardgame to a whole new level.
4:24 that smoke ring tho!
You guys should do more scaleed explosives against different types of scaled vehicles! Such a cool video
You think people like submarines, Gav?  It would be shame if this video...took a dive.
can you do earth explosion in slow motion
Gav looks like Chodi from Shameless now
Tell the truth! You really can do time travel. You are going to 90' so now changing your appearance to blend in.
Das boot reloaded
No Go pros were harmed in the making of this video
Missing Dan's contributions.
Do one with bigger pod and metal submarine
subnautica, anyone?
Good lord,  your chin is exposed, For everyone to see!
200 frames per second? *Scoffs* What is this, some kind of Fast Guys?
Love it !
0:50 He forgot to say "Shot"
slow mo of you cutting your hair???
Nope this video sucked... felt like a go pro commercial with unnecessary comments about how good the camera is
That hair is atrocious 😂 feeling your pain too!
Hows the 4K Bluray coming along Gav?
Gavin Gavin Gavin, ok so depth charges again but like from the inside of a ship or a submarine like using the GoPro or like if the front end of the ship was see through so you can see the internal impact on like little crew members n stuff.
Nice hair gav!
Congratulations! You successfully got me to watch a 9-minute commercial great video, and great cameras!
crash, bang, hot, wet and up
I'm watching this in 2x speed im a rebel
8:35 "Subway". Haven't orderd one out of plastic yet but it seems interesting XD
is this a go pro ad...?
Brits sinking subs. So nostalgic. :-)
OKAY YOU HAVE TO DO A VIDEO WITH TONY HAWK PLEASE
Photography is definitely your love!
Cyclops: Warning! External hull damage detected!
Ive had a gopro hero+ for over 5 years and it had been in the water without a back door on and it still works like new
Listening to people talk at 0.25 speed is so funny.
When Dan finally comes back it's gonna be insane
Wow, I love your hair <3
Once again...Awesome.
Submarine: Hello, how are you, am under da water, here too much explosion, ëêęëēėëêęë
Plot twist the real Slow Mo Guys are in the submarine placed there by fake slow Mo guys who are giants. They have taken the YouTube channel and killed the real Slow Mo Guys. So sad
Be careful, those gopro's can freeze and glitch a lot! Cool footage though 😎⚓️
Gav looks like DeepFuckingValue
6:58 "You sunk my battle ship"
Where is silent Bob? 😂
Gav looks like that guy who lives in his van and sells his own bottled water.
Those aren't only just submarines. They are 1940 German U-Boats. Which were considered a vast nuisance for the British Navy. Depth charges were fairly effective of crippling, or destroying such submarines.
I miss dan
What happened to the other guy
how about slo mow fireworks exploding underwater
So the GoPro on top we had to review ourself.
Was actually in need of a new GoPro so this is perfect timing, I can support a class channel at the same time!
I can’t wait for the both of you being able to do a vid together.
awsome job!
Kudos to the strength of that aquarium! I’ve seen tanks break from a lot less!
Can't wait for them to revisit this in 10 years with a real submarine.
Gav looking a bit like Jay. Dan must be Silent Bob now.
WHERE DAN
*paniced subnautica flashbacks*
After watching you guys for almost 8 years, today I thought to myself "Is Gav actually slowly developing an american accent?"
pressure increases by 1 atm every 66ft, to replicate the real situation you need to increase the external pressure, you may find that explosion behaves more like a shaped charge
5:31 THE FORBIDDEN STRAWBERRY
I love how you didn't address the big swimming pool that the tank was standing in
I’m genuinely curious how much both those cameras are
Looks like a mini sun 😎
Next time you use emoji, please use twemoji, other sets are so cringy
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR BEARD????
This was fun but not submarine exploding under water fun. Need that pressure.
Голливуд 😭
4:04 Gav's looking more and more like a crazy hobo scientists the longer the pandemic lasts.
crash bang hot wet up
No caption for deaf people.
Gav looks like the guy from smurf
Thanks for the great science! Specifically, providing proof that growing long hair can effortlessly increase the attractiveness of otherwise ordinary looking men.
Crash, bang, hot, wet and up
Gav looking like Jay from Jay and Silent Bob
That's great Jay can we get Silent Bob back in the episodes now?
8:07min this is art! I love it!
always surprises me that Hollywood has made those CGI shots so accurate many years back :)
What a 'cool' bonnet, above those shorts. You must feel sweaty. Go on.
What happened to Dan :(
SO many sponsor-heavy messages in the piece. Quite distasteful...
Dan... Daaannnn 😭😭😭😭
Where is Dan?
did you just... cut a 1/72 scale U-boat?
0:08 He looks like Alex from the pals
literally brought a GoPro 8 and within 2 weeks it dropped from 50cm and fully cracked the screen... rugged they say...
GAV... YOU LOOK VER Y SAD WITHOUT DAN...
I fear it has come to the moment when the only thing to one up this is a nuclear explosion. sadly that wont happen. :C
Can you do tanks too?
The way you put the death charge actually happend in real life ww2
Gavin out here looking like Jay from Clerks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonCtV9hklA&ab_channel=ViorelViorel
I've been out of the loop for a fair few months. Where *is* Dan? Is everything okay between you two?
"Crash...bang...hot...wet...and up."  Sounds like a wild night!
I feel like even having Dan in by Zoom or something would be an improvement. His reactions, and the interaction between him and Gav, are half the reason to watch the channel.
I wonder which movie vfx this will inspire next
In that hat does anybody else think that Gav looks kinda like Jay from Jay and Silent Bob?
Thought I'd see a SmarterEveryDay comment on here lol
They must have been singing pretty loudly to have depth charges placed that close.
sonoluminescence
Why’s the video 1080p50?
Put small cameras inside the submarine and  see if water will rush inside
So when are you buying a real sub to smuggle Dan out of the UK and save him the digging with the tunnel?
Bro why does Gav look like he's about to sell me some cheap weed?
nice little snoke ring popped out of the water @4:24
i miss dan 😭
8:40 ...are ya hungry or sumthin?
Yes FINALLY a new video from Gav
Any idea what submarine model is that? My guess would be a u-995 based on the body, but the small details dont seem to match.
Anyone noticed he's getting an American twang to his accent now 😂
Like movies🤩
Where is all this Hair comming from?
this is a P.H.D on how to make a commercial
how is this not sponsored by world of warships
do an above water submarine next time
Depth charge. Not the normal sketchy stuff gopro sponsors
No one: Gav: Smokin weed, smokin weed. Doin' coke, drinkin beers. Drinkin beers, beers beers. Rollin' fatties, smokin blunts. Who smokes the blunts? We smoke the blunts. Rollin' blunts and smokin um'
While watching this video, the volume of water is less compare to submarine what would happen we blast a submarine in swimming pool, the result would different. Please make a slowmo video.
an underwater submarine explosion?  so, an underwater explosion? :3
"Not a real submarine, they're quite expensive" This sounds like if he had the money he'd blow up a real submarine...     ...kickstarter when?
Time to get a slow mo haircut...
Next up: "Nuking North Korea in slow motion"
You forgot about the GoPro that Dan shot with a canon
Greyhound 2 is looking great
Most modern underwater weapons use the shockwave, so getting the depthcharge as low as possible provides more efficiency. Most torpedoes are actually designed to explode below the keel of of a ship, which proves to be very devestating. You may have been better to try it that way.
Couldn't finish the video, too much GoPro shilling over the actual slow mo
Wait Gavin is part of the Slowmo guys?!
He looks high af without his beard and sunny background ngl
I don't even remember the go pro 8 coming out lol
Gav the Chav
5:13 , rare image of a wild orange ball copulating with a submarine
The jumping of the metal bar can be because it's more bouilent in the water.
WHERE DAN AT?😭
This video does not "include a paid promotion", it IS a paid promotion. This is a video about GoPro but with a submarine in it, not the other way around. Shame because the videos that aren't just thinly-disguised adverts are actually really good...
Where is dan gone?can anybody please answer me?
Gav you good? Those bags under your eyes got me worried about u b❤️
When u get sponsored by the Gopro, uve achieved Dota 2
The front is missing, but why. Did you saw it in half or something
wondering if the second depth charge in the last explosion was anticlimactic due to the other 3 having already detonating and the vacuum pocket consuming the charges output so instead of going boom it just filled the void. it would've also made the implosion more gentle if that were the case.
God i miss Dan
that was absolutely awesome
clickbait.
I did not expect the glass of the aquarium tank to resist ?!
Technically the danger isn’t “up” it’s “down at high speed” from “up”
I wonder who thought of this idea
yo who let Jay from Clerks host the Slow mo guys??
Convenient how Gav forgot to mention the one they broke with a cannon.....
I very much enjoyed the last minute smoke ring at 4:24
I was just wondering where you guys were.
Is this really Gav or Jason Mews?
You forget when you shot a GoPro with a cannon
I wonder if this go pro can survive the cannon
A perfect example of why miniatures can be better than CGI. Excellent video!
9:28
Love the tiny pool around the tank, if there would be a single hole, the pressure probably would've overshot the pool anyway 😂
Why are you still doing 50fps?
Where is Dan?
Are you going to do a boat next 🤔
4:24 anyone else see that little smoke ring?
God Almighty! They blew up a Revell Submarine! Those things are expensive!
Shi bta
Would have been interesting to see the explosions at 10 additional atmospheres of pressure, like when the sub would have been at 100 m depth. Wonder whether the kick would have been harder or less hard.
“A real submarine is expensive”   Neither is a model
I recommend to flip the thumbnail horizontally because the video length is blocking the fire ball.
Imagine “The Fast Mo Guys”
Gav kinda looks like a science hobo
Im liking this new look for Gav
One big commercial. Also, in reality, brought to you by; the us mil.indus.compl. :/
4:20 Nobody going to comment on that cool smoke ring?
I miss Dan so much
Ohh that sub joke in the end hurts
Gav does ads and sponsorships right. Just wanted to say that.
Working in GoPro QA must be a fun job.
Why dont i ever see the other guy anymore?
I recently learned that if you put a "closed" string on a film of soap and pop the soap enclosed by the string it will form a perfect circle. I think that could make a nice slow mo vid
This is how they made that massive explosion effect in the Solo starwars movie
Ok ive not watched in a while bit the videos ive watched theres only one guy... Wheres the other one???
Dangerous situations like... “up” 😂
Das Boot
"no Wi-Fi under water" Does that mean that in the sea, nobody can hear you stream?
Great job guys
Its good to see you Gav.
would love to see this at much bigger depth where weater pressure is much higher then compare these two
While I certainly applaud your effort... you fail to take into consideration one of the most potent scientific factors in how a depth charge works, and that’s the weight of the water itself.., if you scuba dive, you’d know the deeper you go, the heavier the water gets as the atmospheres compress. This dramatically increases the destructive power of the charge against a hull the deeper you go! Try this same  experiment on a deep dive pool and watch the magic! 😳😬
Tell me how to make those charges, I won't tell the FBI
And it's a uboat. Nice
Now for SmarterEveryday to do this with a REAL submarine
8:28 that explosion sounds insane like some kind of railgun
Just remember thousands died in subs from explosions such as these (albeit much bigger) during the last 2 world wars. Being a submariner ain't fun and all it takes is one lucky depth charge to ruin your days.
4:24 smoke ring!!!
One of my favorite parts of each video is the music that starts playing at 28k fps
Why did it have to be a U-Boot? Just why. Those subs specifically suffered the most depth charge attacks from allied ships during WW2. And, IM GERMAN! Plus, think of all the crew inside of the subs that DROWNED to death from being depth charged, and their souls watching you make that video. Just do another sub, one that ISNT a U-Boot. Für Gotts Sake...
Gav, I feel like blowing up some LEGO constructions would be really satisfying to watch.
I know that part of this is an advertisement for the gopro cameras, but Gav does a really good job with product integration. It's like he works for a Media Company or something...
So the explosion @ 5:11" looks just like the slomo footage of a nuclear detonation.
here's a crazy idea, ever filmed a Shaped charge vs Explosive Reactive Armor?
A fact that isn't mentioned often is that even if the GoPro camera is destroyed, as long as the micro SD card is intact, the footage can still be recovered.  If one records on an I-phone or I-pad, The SD cards isn't needed either.
A little underwhelming
I hate whenever people use GoPro camera aka FISH EYE LENS aka fake curvature aka mass deception on real 'plane' distorted by GoPro. GoPro are a mega liar. Why people still USE camera that NOT recording real footage? It's fake curvature? Why still use it?? I'm UNSUBCRIBE now, bye!
The SloMo guys is the only channel that has USEFUL sponsorships
I love how Gavvy makes several points about the GoPro's surviving and how they're all lovely and rugged.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dEUHvecW6w A slightly better demonstration of how rugged (or maybe how easy it is to break?) a a GoPro!
Where is Dan?
That's Jay from Jay and Silent Bob!
We want to see Dan
who else expected the fishtank to burst? :D
Here before 305k views 😂 I bet this will get well over a million.
Interesting little smoke ring that appears on top of the water at 4:24. Gav can you explain this to me how a smoke ring can appear from an underwater explosion?
I’ve been afraid to ask... where’s Dan?
Realistically the first charge probably did enough damage to sink them, the second was just overkill lol
Where is Dan?
Wish you'd used a real sized sub is all.
Where's silent bob?
Where is Dan?
Dan! We miss you!
Gav is able to put several explosions in a glass tank but the second I drop a firecracker in a toilet 😂
You should try this experiment again in a swimming pool where the wall is far enough away that the shock wave doesn't reflect back onto the sub immediately.  A pool would also allow you to get closer to the depth a sub might be at when the depth charge fires.  I would think all that water above, below and on all sides would change how this video looks.
Wait, there are explosives and Dan isn’t here?
This video is going to become fight scene in low budget movies 😂😂
But what happens to Dan? Btw amazing video never realized that explosions underwater have so much affect
gavin looking like jay these days
Ww2 flashbacks
Gav look like he about to hit a dab in slo mo.
As an aquarium owner I am impressed with the durability of that tank. I thought it would shatter the glass with the force but that tank is built well. I've been worried about breaking my own by leaning on it.
Awesome video!!!!
At 4:25 a smoke ring comes out of the water :)
8:40 lol
Where is gavin these days . Is he ok  .
Thank you for the wonderful video
Gav: I have put your product in places I wouldn't be and continue to do so and I want another one. gopro: *yes*
WTF, over? We never sailed in a fish tank or in an enclosed area.
“and up”
Next up: Slow motion explosion of the sun
New game, drink every time he references a gopro
Looks like the lock down has an effect on everyone 😂
I'd love to see more of these warships being blown up in slow mo.   Maybe Gavin goes for the World of Warships sponsorSHIP?
It looks like a movie scene lol
neat
did you cut the submarine nose?
Forgive my ignorance, but where has Dan been?
Where is dan?
THAT WAS AMAZING .
12 am ._.  I go to sleep and I get the notification of slow mo xd
These videos aren't the same without Dan.  We miss you Dan
I miss Dan 😭
Hey I'm a huge fan of your channel! Kinda out of the loop question, but is Dan still apart of the channel?
Gav with that long hair and beanie is starting to look like a Chav :P
Who are you and what have you done with Gav?
Always Cool looking SloMo Footage !
Very cool video. A submariners worst dream.
gotta love 'suicide' cameras for recording explosions in slowmo
lives in the usa , dosnt use flash powder
How was rehab lmaoooo jk
Yay! So much better without the beard!
Drachinifel, I know you're here somewhere in these comments
i like how you didn't mention how you obliterated a gopro with a cannon when you were mentioning the "dangerous" situations they've been used in.
What’s up Jay you seen Silent Bob lately? Your hair is getting to be a lions mane 🦁
At 4:25 a smoke ring popped up.
I was just thinking last night: “hmm there hasn’t been a Slo Mo guys video in a while.” Then this morning, I see a notification for a new video! Creepy!😳🤣
I thought this was a subnautica vid 😂
without dan something is lost. something that made these videos so hearth warming and genuine. even tho gavs effort is commendable, something is missing...
Love when he said the air took a long time to escape. Lifes all about perspective and perception huh
ALAAAAAAAAAARM!!!
"and 'up'." XD
GoPros are the new Nokia.
Slo mo nuke pls
Great video!. . Had too many SubWay sandwiches lately?😂😂😂  Check location - 8:40
While Dan's digging up em tunnels how about film both of your reactions while replaying the shots? That would be interesting and I kinda long for seeing you both speak from different perspectives. Anyhows, love y'alls!
2:25 for pufferfish sound meme
I wish you'd made this video last month when I bought my Hero 8!
Gav looks like Fred from big hero 6
Which Star Wars movie are they going to use this footage as inspiration for?
Anyone else like the destruction of small versions of big things?
I miss Dan
Cool GoPro ad. Ill be sure to buy one next time I blow up a submarine
Don't forget hitting a GoPro with a cannonball! That was awesome!
Now I know how Hollywood movies are made 😀
You guys should do a slow motion of a torpedo hitting a battleship
I feel like you need to market the underwater explosions for cgi use
gav looks like he just sank a long nek of vb and is ready to go smoke a fat bowl
Awesome. Keep 'em coming...
Where is this filmed?
a few thousand sailors pooing themselves in their sleep tonight.
Imagine slowmo of a ship or boat been scuttled.
Awesome vid! glad to see you're still alive. I hope dan is doing well
Your channel continues to be #1 in reminding me how good a 32" 4K monitor is as my primary. Thanks again, Gav, for some amazing footage.
Crash, bang, hot, wet, and..... up.
Where is Dan?
get a hyper-realistic submarine and this good be good enough for a hollywood movie
I miss dan
Lesson... Don't store charges on the hull of your submarine???. Is that a _thing?_
"Sub"-scribe. Cheeky
A big ship would be good next
Favourite video yet. Please do more like this
But I don't like slow-mo in general, I like it specifically!
There were some shots that looks like they could be composited into a major film, should send the footage to Corridor and see what they can do
Love from India Kerala
Where's Dan?
Gavin looks like your typical skateboarder that doesn't give a care in the world. Just happy to skate and be alive.
Cheers.
Where’s Dan
The depth charge was lacerated by a sub chunk blade after the other detonations, thus failing to enforce full sub-jugation.
Quarantine has turned Gav into Jay from Jay and silent Bob
Would love to see this in a larger tank, and a steel model lol
Who is “We” ?  Me, myself and I ?  Miss you Dan !
plot twist: This was a real submarine and they were just far so it seemed it was small
Can you please please do a whole series on underwater explosions and submarines but try to use someone's pool I love yall channel thank you for making these videos
This was amazing, and Gavin is starting to look like Fred from Big Hero 6.
Is it bad I watch slow mo guys at 2x speed
Where is Dan?
I've been liking for a video like this since I found YouTube over 15 years ago
Didn't they destroy a Gopro with a canon ball?
폭팔 is 예술
Love Gav but I do miss Dan so much
gav's hair looks like it's one of those hats with a wig attached to it
Gav got tired blowing subs in GTA V so he decided to do it in real life hahaha
Dude you look like Deep Purples Roger Glover!!
Most people: Today's video is sponsored by Nord VPN. The Slow Mo Guys: Today's video is sponsored by GoPro.  How!? XD
1. Crash 2. Bang 3. Hot 4. Wet 5. Up
Where is your partner
134 lives of the submarine crew were taken during this video
Who else saw the perfect smoke ring at 4:24?
Seems like a go pro commercial
Get a haircut!
where is anthor guy
You need buy a bigger tank! The sub-size is fine
Noooooo, Gav's majestic Beardstache is gone D:
Hey Gav your not going to talk about the gopro that you shot with a Canon ball
Gav, you're starting to look like the "no regerts" guy from the movie 'we're the Miller's'..... 😂
Hey, it's Jay with an accent!
We need Dan back
Don’t forget to pay for the subscription before you use the slow mo on the go pro
This really is a poor (pathetic) representation of an event your trying to recreate. Any pet store has bigger fish tanks, (that shouldn't be an issue with the budget you have, especially with guests like Will Smith) Secondly you have used pools before to fire off guns in, why not use one for this? That would of at least given you the ability to keep the sub as it was (or should be). Seems to me like this was a low thought out and pushed through video that at least for me, was a waste of time and a waste for you. To bad...
What happened to the other???
I’m not sure if this was solely for entertainment or supposed to be an actual representation of what would happen, and if it’s the latter then I don’t believe this was executed accurately based on the fact the submarine was already equally pressurized by the water inside. A real submarine of course would be intact and be pressurized by the air inside.
That hair looks majestic and must be freed from the hat
As someone who has recently been reading "Thunder Below!", this gives me chills.
Is Dan still part of Slow Mo Guys, because it's been a while since I have seen him on this channel?
This the kind of footage from Christopher Nolan lol, if he made a submarine movie...
Hey Jay, where's Silent Bob?
4:24 can u see this?? Like if you find that
Gav is starting to look more and more like when he played Woody from Lazer Team
Gav kinda looks like Jay here
Slow mo guy
I love how even tiny explosions look epic under water.   You need an above-ground swimming pool made of bulletproof glass.
Do more model destruction 😂
This makes me think you should try to get with the USN to tape an explosive decommissioning of a ship in slo--mo.  Sometimes when they decommission ships they do it by having ships/subs launch torpedoes at it.  That's be amazing to watch in slo-mo.
can u do a ship being torpedoed
Vro... Your gears are insane😨
Omg I though you stoped posting I’m soooo happy rn
Retest in deeper water
Could you do this again with more subs and other models? Would love to see tanks and airplanes being blown up
What about the Cannonball Incident? 0:43
What happened to Dan? I want to know
You forgot to mention the time Dan shot your gopro with a cannon^^
Better scale up to a Tsar Bomba next
My question is how has Gavin not had a complaint from his homeowner's association
Why was this video labeled "Gavin-free" when it's clearly DAN-free?
Do this but with a regular ship and "torpedo's"?
I don't even wanna know how hot it must've been standing in front of those M40s
ear
Nice ❤️
You've just triggered the PTSD in several W.W.II submarine/U-boat crews.  You've also probably broken a few hearts in the model-making community.
Gah, where's the beard?
Awesome! You're ready to remake "U-571"!
Dude that is like what is up
Thumbnail is what got me here. Pretty cool video,out of,my,normal
1:00 the Canadian navy would argue that buying any submarine is hard.
So Y’all are just casually not going to show us the clip of a go pro being absolutely mullered by a cannon ball. I get they probably don’t want people seeing their product being destroyed but they don’t advertise the go pro as being “Cannon Proof” on the website.
Gav:  We're baking under all these hot lights. Also Gav:  (Wears a warm wool toque)  :D
Ok that looked amazing, thank you!
Does anyone know who the sponsor of this video was? I couldn't quite figure it out.
I’m that guy that wants to know where they got that model from 👀
Crash bang hot wet up
A submarine is more likely to implode in real world situation. Unless explosive was from inside of sub.
Me and my son love watching this stuff. It's so interesting!
Now scale it up to real life... In super clear ocean waters.
"I think that's the thumbnail." Me: *Checks thumbnail  Also me: "Yup."
Clearly Gavin's barber is in lockdown!
Glad you shaved the beard 😄
Where's dan?
Gav looks like one of the Weasley twins from HP 3
Amazing
gav i love you bro, but pls cut ur hair
Hope the salvage mission was a success 💥
Gav, you forgot to mention that you guys completely destroyed one with a cannon ball.
Neat, you finally posted. Been a bit.
Nothing against Gav what so ever, but I miss Dan.
This is not a real submarine, because they're big, expensive, and the people inside get very angry when you try to blow them up.
AAALLLLLLAAAAAAARRRRRRMMMMMM!!!!!
Gav is starting to lose it.  I don't think he will survive another year of lockdown.  Pretty soon he will be posting slow-mo videos of his friends the squirrel family.
Why didn't Kriegsmarine build u-boats out of GoPros then?
Why did he not start by saying hello internet? Who is he talking to?
As a parent who has a son currently floating around in a metal tube in the ocean, this video had horrible timing. But hey...Always and forever a fan.
Where is the second Guy gone ?
Are you ok?
just make dan back to the channel
That aquarium deserves an award of some sort. 🏆
Crash, bang, hot, wet, and.... Up.
That hair is great!
I miss Dan's commentary.
What's with the beanie?
I can see your face
More shockwaves!! Great vid as always!
Does your wife let you in your house?
I'm surprised the tank stayed together.
You look like a different person each video
Where is the other guy?
Small explosions in a fish tank? Been there done that hope it works better for you than it did for 10 year old me lol
Very interesting!!! Love the GoPro Hero 9 Black!!
Not only was this an amazing video, but that is also one sturdy tank you got there!
Dept charges are interesting weapons for sure, although not super effective as you have to get them really close to the target. What's also interesting is that the secondary shockwave of the water rushing back, collapsing the bubble, is actually way more destructive
I would not have used a model of a type 7. 30,000 men died in these under very similar circumstances to what is depicted in the video.
This channel is just the slowmo guy now.
SUB-scribe. I see what you did there!
He looks like if keanu reeves was a drunk for five years but then recovered one year ago
For a moment I was worried about Destin from Smarter Every Day...
This video has brought back all the long suppressed memories of playing Silent Hunter 3/4. I hate hedgehog launchers.
I would pay good money for Gavin to stop shaving his beard....
Crash, Bang, Hot, Wet and Up.  My favorite Slow Mo Guys episodes
Gav lookin like he's fronting a 2011 metalcore band
long hair gav is really weird
Gav, get a haircut, buddy. You're starting to look like a British version of Jay, from Jay and Silent Bob.
my guy needs a hair cut
Keep away from my models !!  ha ha... Great Video 👍⚓
was half waiting for Dan to chime in with how depth charges worked but realized he's still stuck across the pond :'(
"Crash, bang, hot, wet, up"
How about go pro sponsors gavins hair cut?
Notice he specifically doesn't mention shooting a GoPro with a cannon...
I think a redo with a submarine that actually fits inside would be nice to see. That missing stern is probably effecting stuff. XD
I think he played "Holi" before making the video!
For a minute, I thought this was another of smarter everyday's submarine series 😂
Where's Dan been latley???
I feel like Crash, Bang, Hot, Wet, Up needs to be the next Slow Mo Guys shirt
If Dan isn't dressed like Silent Bob when they're next together I will be disappointed
The footage of the falling GoPro from 8:14 to 8:24 looks like the view of a drowning and sinking sailor from the doomed submarine.
Ooooo
We have Jay, now all we need is Silent Bob.
999th comment!
Gav doesn't look like homeless Jesus, yay!
Any idea when you and Dan will get to team up again?
Where did Dan go? I've not seen him on the channel in a while.
Gav looks more homeless without this beard lol
Next video be like:  "Real  2.8 Billion Dollar Submarine Underwater Explosion in Slow Mo."
How's Dan doing?
its just not the same
Oh look, it's Wish Fabio again.
Gav is now Kyler and drinks Monster Energy.
Miss your videos want more please
Where is dan?
Wait is that a voiceover?
No mention of the cannon incident? Probably wise 😉
5:48 and on when you started explaining and kept flinching because of the bright light in your face... I was cracking up. Sunglasses for your next bright shoot, good sir!
So just call this an extended play GoPro advert. Where's the original crew?! Waaaa....
Hey Gav, can you do some kind of video with dan, like a Q and A over zoom or FaceTime, or have Dan film a reaction vid to all of the vids you made without him???🥺 I miss you and him filming together (comedy gold).
This video is sponsored by the song "I've got an Ape Drape" - The Vandals
There's a smoke ring from the second explosion!
I thought it was a real submarine and thought this channel was getting a little out of hand lol
How did you not mention the time Dan obliterated a GoPro with a cannon?
I feel like silent bob is about to show up.
0:55 what the time you hit one with a cannon ball didnt make the cut?
A simple one in would love to see in slow mo is hitting a dot punch with a hammer. I get the feeling the hammer would bounce a few time but at full speed it just feels and looks like one hit. It would also be fun to see how unsteady the hand holding the punch gets as the hammer sings down, just from the unease of swinging a hammer at your own hand. I wonder if there is anything else that gets missed in the speed like maybe sparks from the hammer hitting the punch.
Miss you, Dan!
Yeah my personal experience has the same problem you need a really bright day to film with these cameras
“Crash, bang, hot, wet, and up” are some of the most dangerous thing that can happen to a camera, and a GoPro takes it easily :)
You forgot cannon ball with that montage
Guys where I'd Dan?
Gav looks like Jay for “Jay and Silent Bob”.
4:24 I love how Dan says "woo" and the sub follows with a little "o" of smoke a second later lol
looking like Jay, from Jay and Silent Bob (Dan?)
Welcome back!!
The boys ☝️👏
where is the other guy :/ ?
gavin... SUB scribe...im dying
Gav needs Dan to dress like Silent Bob
you should leave your hair growing until you get back with dan and then do a hair shavers in slo motion
I miss Dan
Gav: "Im Gav....." Me: "I miss Dan"
Sub in a tub finally has the fanfare it deserves
Tha hair gets longer and longer^^
Seeing this video gave me a good idea what kind of horror submariners would face under depth charge attacks...
I would love to see this done on an airtight submarine to get the full effect of depressurization.
Yo is weed legal in TX now? Gav looks like he's cosplaying as Jeff Spicoli
Gavin looks straight out of 1995 in this one.
We have all been had
Slow Mo Guy*
Hedgehog hit
Didnt know jay, from jay and silent bob was in slow mo guys
Nooooooooo your beard, where is your bears
I'm surprised Gav didn't mention when they shot a go pro with a cannon for the captain Morgan sponsored vid
*dubstep intensifies*
...so Dan's still in England. Maybe he could live in Texas once he can travel
Imagine a collab betten Slow Mo Guys and Mythbusters
What a beautiful submarine model! Where did you fellas purchase it?
Slow mo is so cool. Especially yours!
You even shot a GoPro!
Gotta say, the long hair doesn't look very good on Gavin
4:24 smoke ring
I liked the little smoke ring at 4:25
Sorry I know this question has probably been asked a thousand times over, but how come Dan doesn’t really feature anymore?
Diggin' that hair!
Remember when Dan shot a gopro with the cannon? Conspicuously absent from the promo good call Gav
Nice hair cut
You just sank a sub...............
God your hair and beany are annoying!!! Looks like a lame version of Jay!
Now I'm wondering what a sub implosion would look like in slo-mo.  I wonder if there's a way to stimulate high water pressure in a tank, maybe some kind of sealed hydraulic press?  Great video, there's probably more than a few wallpapers in there
so like, where'd you get that submarine
We need Dan back, hope covid restrictions allow this soon👍👍
Where can I get that submarine??
I thought you were going to blo an actual submarine up 😂
I think we need to see some more underwater models blowing up...
The legends are back at it again
Did you use a model kit to build this? You shouldve glued it together. or next time if you want to get damage more similar to that of a real sub you should get one that the hull is made from 1 piece.
LONG HAIR GAV
Let me know when you do a pt ill lend ya my kosatka
Didn't know Keith Gill also made slow-mo videos...
What was up with the preview
The cavitation bubbles are so cool.
One does not simply:  Looking if it's actually the thumbnail
Now film an outer space submarine explosion.
Note to self dont get depth charged in a german uboat
So what is your experience?  Crash. Bang. Wet. Hot.
Talking about GoPro in this channel without mentioning Dan ahooting one with a cannon feels weird
Where gav???
This would be amazing if they took a REAL retired sub and blew it up in slomo
You forgot "cannon" in that list
If, rather than an airbladder, that sub were air-tight, it wouldn't have lasted that first blast.
Yeah, I don’t know why the old cameras didn’t have a clip built in. I don’t know if I ever even filmed without my housing with my old 4.
More of this destruction. Slowmolition ranch
THE BRARD. IS GONE. HE HAS BABY FACE ONCE AGAIN.
Whats happening with dan?
Gavin has finally evolved into his "Tom Hiddleston Thor Audition" form.
Tank survived to see another slo-mo day.
The... the Beard!!! NOOOO!!!!!
Awesome video as always. Your comment about wifi not working through water explains why I stopped getting a feed to my phone when I was trying to take an artistic video of a waterfall by running the GoPro through the water below the waterfall. Only an inch under water, and the phone was only  two feet from the camera and line of sight, but the feed dropped out.
LaLaRc would be mad at you 😂
What happened to dan?
Gav high key looks like a bank robber
Anyone else missing Dan's reactions ❤❤❤
I wonder how much Dan looks like Silent Bob by now?
What music do you use for the slow no footage?
That’s how you please the sponsors 😁
Yessss!!!! Finally!!!! A new upload!!!!
Where’s Dan?
This is a mix of The Slow Mo Guys and "behind the scenes of Red October"....
its fine gav, we are all the same but different at the same time... im losing my sanity, i hope you still have some of yours left and dont let yourself influenced by others that much, if you do your best, your job is done :) its 1AM by the time im writing this
You never mentioned the time Dan hit the GoPro with the cannon.
what happened to our boy gavin?
Kinda wanna see an actual scale replica submarine made to spec, Get hit with a scale depth charge in a swimming pool.  Seeing it decompress in slow motion.
Crash Bang Hot Wet And Up: The Slo-Mo Guys memoirs title
Who disliked this video!?!?!
Pls get Dan there somehow
Where is silent Bob?
What is it? Was it a model? A small explosion, implosion does not occur because it is not pressurized. Is it a temporary state?
2:45 watch at 0.85x speed
To the good and sensible people reading this - you're awesome, you're loved, you can do this, have a great day :)
Where Dan?
Still having the mid-life hippie stage eh? :P
Can we get a comparison of different (high) explosives at this scale? The unburned black powder seen here gives us something to compare and contrast ☺️
What explosive was used?  Black powder?
https://youtu.be/o-ZQXkEWOek k
I fully 100% expected that tank to shatter after the first charge. Very impressed with the tank as much as I am with the GoPros.
This makes me want to watch Das Boot again for some reason.
More Skinny Pete than Tony Hawk
“Nice lil puff” - Gavin lol
Insert "toy" Into your title, quite misleading!!
Yes something I have been suggesting for years  !!!
Where is Dan?
GoPro went cheap on you if their money didn't get you a real sub. Could've partnered with Destin though. I'm sure he'd have been happy to plant something for you...
You look like Jesus
that was cool
Gav looks like Pro skater Jamie Thomas
Should it be renamed to the slow mo 'guy'?
Hopefully the beard  being gone stays gone.  You don't look like slo mo jesus anymore.
Controlled explosions, looking forward to see more of it.👍
Crash. Bang. Hot. Wet. Up. Sounds like a rugby player describing his wedding night!
Also is it possible to see explosive decompression in slomo?  what would a real submarine blowing up look like on the inside?
I miss Dan :(
Where is dan?
Lame gopro
Legit thought this was going to be a Smarter Every Day episode...
Gav looks like he spent most of 2020 hanging out with Silent Bob.
good stuff gav... nice bohemian look too... gotta change the channel name to slow mo guy these days....
Clearly Dan was consulted for setting those charges up.  Demo is his thing after all, and Gav didn't lose any fingers.
“Slo Mo Guy”
nice mullet
Hey Jay, where's silent bob? Still digging he way?
Now I want to watch 'Run Silent, Run Deep' again
Pretty much just a go pro ad
Gav really didn’t mention the time they blew up a GoPro with a cannon ball
Do you have your own phantom? Or do you borrow destins like everybody else
Gav looks terrible with long hair
Completely inaccurate model of ship , bomb was ok
Skype Dan or somthing. Then drag em around on a TV cart! Then you guys can still talk while your doing what you do
"Buying submarines online is hard." Wasn't that hard in GTA
im not sure why but miniature models of massive things being destroyed is so satisfying to me, maybe you could do this again with a scale model ship or something, and preferably one that fits in the tub!
4:23 I love the little smoke puff that gets shot out at the end.
I tried to sub-scribe once but got arrested for vandalism....they said it was graffiti, or something.  ;P
Go pro is over rated and over expensive
Was this sponsored by Loreal?  You can't fool me!
Gav should make a t-shirt that says, “we got some good frames”
glue a piezoelectric disk to the 5 sides of that fish tank turn the mechanical energy to electric then into sound also put some in the water for the same reason
if the submarine was properly sealed, you’d definitely get a better pop
Where are you friend???!?
So what about the time when Dan shot a GoPro with a canon?
So have you had an offer yet for the next bill and Ted's excellent adventure role..
I'm out of the loop where's dan
Was he giving anyone else PaRappa the Rapper vibes?
Does GoPro know Dan obliterated a GoPro with a cannon?
i think if you could do this again with pressurised tin or soft drinks cans you might get some cool footage of crush damage like a real submarine would take
So I watched the newer A-Team movie, and i totally thought Gavin was Murdock. Lol
I like how he has amazing slow-mo cameras but the video itself has been uploaded to YouTube at 50fps instead of 60.
Who saw the smoke ring at 4:25
I am incredibly disappointed, this is not even a real submarine! What happened to making ambitious videos? This channel is going downhill fast.
Gav's really let himself go without Dan
thank you so much for your content! we miss you guys
Another fantastic video! By the way, I have an insane video suggestion for you two, but I need to have someone send me a message so I can explain it. It's too long to post as a comment. I hope someone sends me a message, as I really, REALLY believe you will love it!
Where is Dan? I live under a rock.
I would have said do a pressurized miniature model but that’s probably expensive too... plus dangerous.
when you forgot to open the missile hatch  this happen
Do sawstop
I love what you did there at the end to "subscribe"
3:00 looks like gum
first anthony and now dan? what is happening with youtube duos?
Awesome footage!
Did Dan Die??????????
WHOA!! Beardless Gav is..... almost unrecognizable.
dude i love your videos. i watch them a lot. what happen to Dan tho?
8:38 When you're too hungry during late-night shoots...
Somewhere there's a beard wandering around the countryside desperately looking for Gavin. "GAVIN! Gavin?! GAAAV? has anyone seen Gavin?!" and so on you get the joke
2:21 that was my nickname in high school
Where os dan? I didnt ser him un the last videos
Great flow gav
D  U  S  K    B  O  Y  S
Great video! but there's a high pitched whine around the 6 minute mark. I'm guessing it's electrical interference caused by the gigantic lights
stop shaving off yer beard, it looks good on you
The first thing I noticed was gavs glorious flowing hair.
I love the way he counts down to zero, even though he's not coordinating with anyone.
Have you ever put food coloring in a charge and detonate it under water?
So we're going to skim over the gopro you shot with a cannon ... allllrighty the
Was Dan busy for this video
You looking like a true RAD scientist, bro! 😆
I have that mount on my GoPro Hero 8 Black.
Need to ZOOM Dan  May you could replicate a thing he does and show the details he missed in slow mo.
This is a commercial for that fish tank more then the gopro
GAV remembered his gmail login
Destin's doing a thing with subs at the moment... just sayin.
Gav looks like Jay of Jay and Silent Bob.
At first I thought it was part of Smarter Every Day: Deep Dive series :)
Submariners who watch this might have nightmares.
I miss the other guy that used to host with you and take all the physical punishment, been so long I cant even remember his name, Dan or something
Gav where is Dan? Gotya take the "S" out of the title with only one of you. Great vidio though!!!
Where is dane?
“They’re quite expensive” as casual as can be
This is why I would never go on a submarine.
I'm happy he shaved bc now he no longer looks like my cousin 😆
Who else is let down at the fact that he didn’t blast the tank ✋😂
I miss your buddy.
You rock Gav, but i miss Dan.
Whats with the Jay and silent bob look? Jaja
is Gav finally having a mid-life crisis?
Where is Dav?
So where’s Silent Bob?
Yet another video gets uploaded without Daniel... This has been the worst part of COVID tbh
Subnautica 😳
Gavin getting a real Jay and Silent Bob look.
I imagine your neighbords know what you do by now but I kinda imagine if one were to sell their house they'd do so with a knowing grin and not mention you to them heh.
the good old Type VII 🤩
Guess he forgot about the gopro they hit directly with a cannon?
I forgot... When will Dan be back again? When Dan comes back do something ridiculous...
Another episode of  the Promo Guy!
And up ha
Holy ur hair!!!!!! Omg wow waaaaat
Gavin looks so good with long hair tbh. It's sad that he hates it so much
Is that "Young Jay" from the new Jay and Silent Bob film?
Is that a german one?
You look a lot younger without beard.. but keep the hairs growing! lol video is amazing
Love this, love you. I look forward to Dan returning as well.
Gav: We've put gopro in dangerous situations like crash Me: and shot by a cannon? Gav: bang Me: and shot by a cannon? Gav: hot Me: and shot by a cannon? Gav: wet  Me: and shot by a cannon? Gav: and up Me: what about when you shot one with a cannon?
Are there someone missing in this video?
The English were so good at doing that to the real u-boats that there's only one Type VII left -- the type the model is of -- remaining it's a memorial/museum ship near Kiel, where they mainly sailed from. And there's also one of the longer-ranged Type IX in a museum in Chicago.
I love Gav... Love slow mo guys.. But I´m really starting to miss Dan =( Anyways awesome video as always <3
Hey guys, i love your videos, but I'd much rather have an actual add than a product placement ish one, love you nonetheless, keep up the cool vids
Nice long hair!
Is that Jason Mewes?
We definitely need slow mo of cutting Gav's hair in a most fabulous  way with Dan there 😂
I miss Dan 🦊
Jesus, what happened to Gav.
Yeah! Beard is gone!
Is “up” a condition?
If you could do a video on shooting big glass balls in slowmo saw a demolition ranch video where he did and it had a strange effect
Where’s other matey?
Great. Next please a heavy metal drummer giving it what for.
I see what you did there with that scribe thing...
Love to see a submarine crushed in slow mo.
underwater * * * * *MODEL submarine * * * * explosion... in slow mo
Youtubers nowadays" how to make a convincing thumbnail "
Yoooo!!!! That's sooo cool!
They're on 9 already? I lost track after 5.
jay looking like he cleaned up and gained weight. where is silent bob?
WHERE’S DANNNN
Where is dan 😢
Can you make the same video with a real submarine? That would make great footage.
Neat little submarine experiment, tucked into a continuous GoPro advertisement.
Dan is still dead and nonexistent rip
Crash, bang, hot, wet and up.... More like Hot, wet, up, bang.....crash?
He forgot the time Dan shot one with a cannon.
you should do Dan being hit in the back with a squash ball in slow mo
We've missed you slomo Jesus :)
Where's Dan
Use a phantom on a blooming corpse flower!
It... it is Wednesday my dudes?
I miss Dan :(
Great video Gavin! Looking forward to when you & Dan can get together again & come up with some really good Slow Mo stunts!  👍👍😉😉
How is Dan????? Any chance we could get an update on life from him??
Somewhere: "And I'm Dan"
Thanks for another EXPLOSIVELY RIVETING report.
I thought the thumbnail was for subnautica...
Guys...it's code. Dan is trying to come to the U.S. via sub and this is Gavé way of telling him the dangers. The government knows Dan, be careful
What happen to the other guy
But if it had air inside and not water?
A bit too heavy on the "sponsored" side for me.
Hey Gav, when's the pro model out?
I'd bet that nose can hold an impressive amount of cocaiñe.  Thanks for another great vid Gav.
Gavs 12 year old cousin now presenting SloMo.....
He looks like the lost hanson brother.
I love that Gav is still working by himself... but I miss Dan. We need to move him to Texas already.
Who is this young boy😁😁😁
I remember when I saw the making of Independence Day when they were blowing up the buildings, they used small model buildings and blew them up and slowed it down to look like this! Awesome Slo-mo Guys! 🔥🔥🔥
Clearly GoPro forgave you for turning one of their cameras to bits with a cannon shot
we want dan back >:C
Wer is Dan
in real life the goal is to get the depth charge to detonate BELOW the submarine giving the shock wave it's best chance to do damage to the hull integrity of the sub. (and yes, I served on Submarines) Obviously we are not fond of depth charges but it's very interesting to see it in slow mo!
we got Jay, wheres Silent Bob?
It would be lovely to have Dan at least check-in or do a collaboration during lockdown.
Question: how does the average person buy explosives
Wheres Dan at?
it's cool you say a camera is faster when it can show you things slower
Anyone know where Dan is?
What's the progress with Dan's tunnel?
What does an implosion look like underwater/in air? Imploding an air filled object using water pressure for example?
That GoPro promotional link just comes up with 404 Page Not Found for me.
why does gav look like that kid from vine with the pointy ears that danced to  *ahem*   SSSSTTEEEWWWWWWWWW *CLICK* SSSTTEEWWWWW
Where’s dan
Anyone else running a little scenario in their head as the sub sinks?
Gavin: buys a submarine that fires homing missiles in gta V Also Gavin: 0:11
So sorry if this is already known, but what happened to dan? I haven't seen many vids w/ him recently and nobody is really talking about it.
It would be interesting to do this in a large pool without the glass of the tank bouncing the shockwaves all over so quickly and back into the sub
i was really about to question the budget from the title but luckily gav isn't going to go bankrupt
If “The Hunt for Red October” was shot by an AV Club...
RIP Gav's beard. 2020-2021
Explosions on Slow-Mo Guys aren't the same without Dan involved.
Damage Control report!  We can’t take another charge Captain 👨‍✈️
Hey Jay where is silent bob?
Gav has a chin???? 😂😂😂
Gav looking like Jimbo (Simpsons)
No Dan... so a slow mo guy.
Where's Dan these days?
YES
I miss dan
Hull is breeched! Ship damaged! Mayday!
"This video is sponsored by GoPro" - because The Slow Mo Guys have been buying about 12% of the company's output for a decade.
That fireball looks so delicious I want to eat it
Did Gav just name the 5 signs of death? Crash, bang, hot, wet, and... up(?)!
I never knew Gav was in Hanson.
Sub-scribe - that alone would do it for me if I wasn’t already!
Starting to look like Jay from Jay and silent Bob there Gav
You and Dan need to get vaccinated so we can get some more of him! It honestly feels like he’s not a part of anything anymore
Smarter Every Day would've used a real submarine, just saying.
What happened to Dan 😰
Россия смотрит!)))
Cracking channel but ya looking worse for wear at the moment.
Barbers must be on strike.
Umm . . . . . Have these two parted ways ???
Gav used so much slow mo that he aged backwards
Link is dead
Crash, bang, hot, wet, and up long ago the five elements lived together in harmony
Now find a way to do it on a real sub in a state pool or something could just be a baby Sub like in GTA
This submarine is a case of 'failed to return from patrol"
Destin "Here's what a sub looks like and how it works." Gavin "Here's what it would look like if we blew it up."
What happened to your partner?
when is Dan back??
Please add a playback with a frame rate scaled to the size of the sub
F in the chat for Gav Christ.
Gav starting to look like Y2K out here
That was awesome as always!
THEY'RE BACK!!!!
Admiral Dönitz's ghost is weeping.
it looks exactly like in das boot
Me looking at the title: "Wait, isn't that like an act of War or something?"
Gav looking more like adolescent Gavvy
the slow mo guy
Slo mo a plasma torch
You should have DIY perks make you some ridiculously bright LED lights
I miss the other slow mo guy
Miss dan so much :(
I'm making sure to U-Boat-scribe ;)
Thank god the beard's gone.
You should do a collab with Demolition Ranch! It would be epic!!
Sugestion: If the channel is going to keep its name, you should look for another guy if the one that already was in it, wont come back.
"Thankfully, because it's such a rugged camera, the footage will be saved...in theory."
Looks like Gav needed a pair of sunglasses while shooting the footage for this video. 😎
Suggestion for a different video would be a charge under the keel of a ship. Modern torpedoes don't actually impact a ship. They detonate under a ship and use the cavitation bubble to, basically, break its back.
Ok this is like a childhood dream fantasy. I think now you have to do a series of blowing up toys of some manner.
Nice little "sub"scribe joke there at the end. Well played, sir
You need a bigger tank.  that tank is too narrow for explosions like that. You need at least a 200 gallon tank so the walls of the tank don't interfere as much
Quite expensive 🤣
Hahaha my hair is just like his and I'm wearing a stocking hat right now too ✅
I like the last shots from the GoPro on the bottom of the tank, it looks like the GoPro sneezed and brought down the sub.
Make a slo mo video of a washing machine destroying itself by throwing a brick inside.
Gavin went full circle back to his greebo days
I really like how Gav and Dan always fully explain the setup they are using and their equipment
It still feels so wrong not having Dan in the Slow Mo videos anymore 🙁
lol I wonder why you didn't show the clip of a gopro getting mashed by a cannon ball
I miss Dan :(
I miss the beard. But also Dan. Mostly the beard. But also Dan.
How you gonna cosplay as both Jay and Silent Bob?
What about when you shot the GoPro with a tank?
Excuse me, skater boy, where’s Gav?
Clickbaaaiiitttt  Still enjoyed.
underwater explosion looks so cool, maybe try a firecracker in cooking oil or something even heavier?
So next video will be using a real submarine right?
Epic
Wheres dan gone you pair need to do another video together
this message is for GO Pro  Manufacture ( how about fixing your mic Jack so it works just like it works on dead radio from 1955)then sell your product .
2 months later....
Crash bang hot wet and up
That "SUB"-scribe at the end though haha
give us an update on Dan pls
What happened to the other guy?
You look like Jay! Dan could make a good silent Bob.
I would like to see more of those explosive videos...
I've never heard the plural of vortex. Thanks for educating me that it's like vertex which makes a lot of sense:D
Did Gavin shave his beard to have it transplanted on the top of his head or something?
Nice Gopro advert 😐  Gopro... Gopro...Gopro... .... .... .... Gopro sheesh.
The way the go pro shots are just not right 🤣🤣🤣
Dan's the real hero. He's the SlowMo BroPro Hero we all need.
Dan update? How’s his tunnel digging going?
Почему один в кадре?
I still remember that one GoPro that got mullered by a cannonball while filming a stunt for Captain Morgan. Dan looked pretty guilty when he realized that he'd actually hit that poor GoPro dead on.
Gav is getting his surfer look down for the summer 😂
Where is yur friend partner ???
Few videos past : canon shots into the go pro Go pro company : here some go pro cams.
you broke the gopro site
Gav you look like a hippy
0:40 Don’t forgot that one time with Captain Morgan as well 😂😂
Somebody needs to invite you and your gear along for a ride-along: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7aY3mC1sFg
Do the same test but in a larger pool so the shockwave is not affected by the smaller pool sides.
Some of these vids are mostly silent. Others are mostly their reactions. And others are mostly explanations and “look at this thing that happened”. And I’m fine with ALL of them.
Where's Dan?
Боже как же ахуенно! Нихуя не понятно, но очень интересно
were fat guy? he already fired ?
Is Dan inside tho? He usually take the beating
Gav, you need to change the link in description to not have an exclamation point. The link brings up a "Page Not Found"
Your go-pro link is 404ing.
Please do the same explosions but without sub and use air, water, oil etc fluids and also do a mix of fluids to see different shock waves in different mediums it'd look awesome! Please try!
I kind of miss the other guy ... Gav why doesn’t he come in the videos any more?
Cool. And if you make the water thick like a gel, then the explosion will be different. There will be no small bubbles. By the way, it's great to watch the layout collapse. You can blow up mockups of anything. You can even build a model of a small town and detonate an "atomic bomb" in it. 💣😆 Slowly, it will look like an atomic explosion. Only it will be necessary to add gasoline to the explosion to get a fiery mushroom, like in an atomic bomb.
On thing to keep in mind about real dept charges is that any real damage is on the other side of the sub opposite the explosion the due to the weight of  water being displaced sideways insanity fast to fill the void the charge creates and that breaks subs hull
Now you've all watched this, go watch: 'Das Boot'.
6:32 the way gav has to have one eye closed because of the blinding lights behind the cameras
Dan would have been perfect for this video. As he knows about demolition charges quite a lot.
You can't use detcord without Dan, that feels just... Wrong.
"hot, crash, bang, wet, and up" soooo descriptive hajahah
I really loved this video!
Gav... explosives without your explosives expert on hand? Its practically adultery!
YASSSSSSSSS!
Can we get a Dan as Silent Bob cosplay?
Loved this vid!
Do you see the smoke ring at 4:25? cool vid!
Go Pro is definitely dying
Snoogans.
Gav rejecting humanity and returning to greebo
Wheres the other guy?
YAY!  New video! Sad you didn't have a tank large enough to fit Dan in as well as the submarine.  Covid-19 lockdown - am I right? How on earth did you keep the glass from cracking?
How do you know you won't shatter the fish tank too?
Gav is starting to look like his 18 year old self
I never would of thought to question weather wifi works in water or not, but it makes sense the more you think about it
Thanks! I loved this!
jay and silent bob anyone
Really Great stuff here
Where a mask and get vaccinated so we can get Dan back you cowards
Slow Mo Guys? Check! Explosives on Slow Mo Guys? Check! Dan dealing with the explosives like he did while serving his country? :( No check!  Dan, if you're reading this, we miss you!
Come back to us, Dan... The show is not the same without you.
Deleted footage from Das Boot?
Oh my christ Gav cut your hair we've not been in lockdown that long!
I like how Gav's hair is slowly going backwards through the decades. Now 90s skater, he'll be rocking a mullet and then a perm soon enough
I'm surprised GoPro sponsored you conisdering you utterly destroyed one with a cannon a few years ago.
Only Gavin can watch full speed footage and be like “Oh I saw some great frames in there! I think I saw the thumbnail.”
Why is there no dan
I am once again asking you to include Dan via Zoom or something when reviewing the footage
Did... Gav get younger?
Hobo -gav has evolved into skaterbro -gav.
Bring back the beard.
Professor Jesus?
Can anyone tell me what happened to his friend. Why he is not coming in the recent videos?
Where's Dan?
#TheSlowMoGuy ?
The url for gopro in the description needs to remove the ! at the end
Waiting for Gav to say "snoochie boochie" as he looks like Jay from Jay and Silent Bob.
Once again a super video.
Nice piece. Please give our regards to Dan!
Gav and silent Dan
Why're you filming at night now?  Also was fully expecting a clip of dan shooting the go pro with a Canon
Always fun to watch explosions, no matter the format.
clickbait at it's finest
It would take hours to edit such a video!
1000 times slower than real time, you say... hmmm... [sets playback to .25...]
I'm probably late but where is Dan
GoPro link 404'd
Please do vids daily!! 😂😂 or at least a few a week. Pleeeease
eyyy
Dan coming back to slo mo is going to be like when Jesus came back from the dead
Was really hoping this was a collab with Subway/Potbelly
For a half second I thought this was in Smarter Every Day's submarine series, and I was very confused how he got approved to blow up a sub.
There needs to be a proper scale model with each of the individual rooms so that the charge can actualy break joints and fill them with water.
Would be interesting to see Gavin do something with an F1 car. Or around it. Would be fascinating
Maybe Moving Mirror in camera  in slomo???
Is the audio slightly out of sync for anyone else?
as a submariner this make me uncomfy
With Gav's current look, he needs a fluffily bearded Dan so they can do a Jay and Silent Bob themed video
The sub is doing some sick vape tricks around 4:24
So scary and yet so beautiful
Gav looks like a British version of Jason Mewes from the Jay and Silent Bob movies
What happened to Dan?
where is Dan?
I’m disappointed you couldn’t get Dan out there to sit inside the sub to experience it first hand.
yAYYYYYYY new vid
The makers of the tank deserve a medal because it held up well!
Why did you put waterproof housings if they're already waterproof?
*Try running the video at different playback speed and share your experience/reaction in the comments 😂*
Did the dudes break up or is it just the distance and the pandemic?
Gav, you shaved your beard! You look so young.
Hey! Where's the other guy? I don't like you.
Couldn't even get a real submarine.... Such cheaps..
bit disappointed to see Gav found the shaver again...
Gracious of you to not mention that those dinky GoPros aren't tank ammunition proof >:( (/s)
I miss Dan 😔
Had no idea a new Jay and Silent Bob movie was coming out
"Not a real submarine, those are rather expensive"  Almost sounds like Gavin looked into purchasing a real submarine.
weird.. is this guy your twin ? there's something off
Hey Gav when is your Loreal Photoshoot
I got an error 404 when I tried to use the slowmo guys link from the description. Wow.
What happened to Dan, when will he be coming back onto the Slow Mo Channel?
Where is Dan?
When is dan coming back
Best video in a year!!! 👍👌
I wonder who put that giant submarine model together or if it was already assembled? Looks daunting..
Where's gav??
Nice nine mins wasted on advertisement, time well spent me.
Dan brings the charm
Do a hair cutting in slo mo video. Not for any reason in particular but use gavs hair
Your gopro link is not working. Check.
Missed you. Can't wait until you're able to be together.
Im missing dan
We’re you inspired by Destins submarine series?
Where you hiding silent Bob?
Sub - scribe😂😂😂👏🏻
The HERO 8 black also has those flaps. It’s cool for moments when the housing is not necessary.
Mine as well rename the show.. no more "guys" anymore.. just "guy" - The Slow Mo Guy
Awesome footage and that surfer hair is priceless!
Thank god the beard has gone 😁
I miss the other guy
where is the beard ? Where is Gavin ? so many questions ...
Where's DAN
i'd completely forgotten how gav looked without a beard. now i've forgotten what he looks like *with* one
I love the videos even with just Gavin in them but I must admit I miss the dynamic of Gav and Dan. Covid has spoiled so much
I almost forgot that I'm subscribed to this channel...
woaaah definitely do more with models this was so cool
Gav looks like the rich guy from BIG HERO 6
Now that you have a GoPro Partnership, you know you have to do a go pro breaking the sound barrier.
how did he get Jason Mewes  to host
Take a Water bladder and take Colored Water to see how the Water is getting moved arround from the schockwaves
Thankfully the beard is now gone!
LOVED THIS!
We miss dan
Only Jay! Thaught Bob would be there too!. Gav really reminds me Jay from Jay and Bob
@ 5:08 " WHATTA PEACH" 🍑
The slow mo guy
The explosion is really powerful🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I am looking forward to the next video already... and a time when Dan can join the fun. We haven’t ruined a lab coat in far, far too long (/GLADoS voice)
Gavin free pro skater
Boo @ Gopro
What happened to Dan? Is it appropriate to ask about it?
I have the same imflatable pool that you have
where is silent bob ?
Destin might be able to hook you up if you ever want to try this with a real sub :D
GET A HAIRCUT HIPPY! 🤣
That looked epic.  Loved the different angles and frame rates.  GoPro cameras are the nuts.  How's that tunnel coming along?
'sub' scribe,  very good
His hair just keeps getting longer
Wow GoPro's are pretty bad quality at 200fps.
Gav looks like he went on a journey of self-discovery.
Guys what happened to Dan? I'm coming back to this channel after sometime now and I really miss Dan
Where is the other slowmo person
U-Boat getting hit by a depth charge somewhere in the Atlantic, 1944.  (Color footage)
I wanna know bernie's reaction to this
where's Dan?
Where is dan ??
Hey Jay, where's silent Bob?
Imagine playing a video game on 28,500 FPS
What happened to the beard?!😧
I think it's probably more that the explosion of that external depth charge took the easier route into the air bubble from the bag than it failing to go off properly. That's what it looks like to me.
So... Where's Silent Bob?
i don't watch the slow mo guys in a long time, where's dan
That thumbnail looks like subnautica
Very cool as always.
Gav, for the love of all things good.... please never shave your beard again.... please
Soy el único aquí que habla Español??
There is a bit of misinformation about what is waterproof to a specific depth.  It is the water pressure at the depth stated (in this case 30 feet) so if you threw the GoPro into the water and the force was greater than the pressure at 30 feet it would fail even though it was only at the surface.
Hoping to see the new TMX 7510 model featured on your channel soon! 80,000fps at 720p!
Haven’t even watched the video and I already love it
I was hoping you were gonna blow it to pieces
amazing
Reminds me of Mythbusters
Awesome 👌
When is Dannyboy gonna be back? D: Get dem vaccines, boys! :D
“They’re quite expensive” you don’t say
Link is broken though
explosives without dan kinda feel weird 😂.. cause usually he is one that does these things in your videos! A great video as always!
This is cool.  On vacation in the Philippines my dad and I dove on an IJN submarine and heavy cruiser.
what an interesting go pro ad
So hey is there a submarine again ? Explosions Look better without it i would say.
ENERGY can neither be created nor destroyed..
Best ad for GoPro
How does a camera even capture THAT MANY FRAMES in a second?
Hey does anybody know why Dan isn’t in the videos anymore?
...where's Dan?
Gav, your videos have been very inspirational to me for years. This one was just awesome. Thank you
First Veritasium, then SmarterEveryDay, then Slow Mo Guys. What day is it today that everyone is uploading?
I hope Dan has that same hair next video
Pog
India wants to know your location.
I am here after watching Destin's submarine videos 😎😎😀
I just got a new laptop so this video should be a good test to see if it can load the 4k video
Is this GoPro linse cover Customer changeable ? I did stop buying them cause now they are useless to me.
Jay and silent bob
Another episode of   “The Slo-mo Guy”
So just a gopro ad huh..
hi
Hi Gav
"Thought it was a real submarine"
Get that bag from GoPro!  It's one of the few brands that I have heard literally nothing bad about. They simply make good action cams that do what they promise.
so how did he get those explosives?
Slow Mo Guys with Jay and Silent Bob
Maybe put pressure in the tank, making the sub implode as it does in reality? Would be fascinating in slo mo
Sup
Great job!
Like being submerged in a steel tube isn't scary enough
#GavKilledDan
Where is his skateboard?
was this filmed in a theatre? I'm wondering if one let him use their lights
Where is dan??? He must have been in the tank.
4:23 cool smoke ring/ball
All the boys are here: Crash, Bang, Hot, Wet, and Up
Notice how he doesn’t mention the go pro they shot with a cannon

Love your videos. Can't wait for Dan to return!
How did he manage to age back to 15!?
Gav looking like a Tony Hawks character creator set on full random
YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME @ WHAT YOU DO & ADDED UNREAL EXPLANATIONS 💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
Real subs at depth explode like a TNT bomb as the pressure differential between the deep water and the pressurised sub create an explosion that combusts so a big fireball
First lol ha ha ha
Why is it when I'm subbed, have the bell on, and looking everyday, I never see their latest bids, I've missed 4 months worth of vids because of this, and JUST FOUND OUT TODAY
Hurts me every time he says sub instead of U-Boat
YOU NEED to collaborate with DEMOLITION RANCH !!!!!!!!
Nice to see you again Gavin :-)
BIGGEST FAN from "INDIA"
Where is another one???
Remember when they shot a GoPro with a canon? Yeah... I can understand why the didn't mention that one.
what happened to Gavs hair
What the .... who is this guy ? Is this Gav ? We’re is his 🧔 beard ?  Mis the dynamic duo !
I live in France my English is not good but Iam a BIIIIIIG FAN of you SlowmoGuys I wish you and your team the Best and THANK U
It’s weird seeing him with long hair and no beard
Gavin rocking the long hair. Looks good
So where is Dan I miss him did I miss something? 🥺
They look so cool underwater
i love these guys
waiting for some special content, when Dan's come back
You look kinda like jay from Jay and Silent Bob
No one:  My dumass: WHERE IS DAN
Sweet
Cut that wig off!
How far is Dan to America
Early, Gavvie bb! :D
The 5 dangers of Gopros. *crash, bang, hot, wet, and up*
“I think I saw the thumbnail in there”   Lmao
Hello, Gav!
This sort of reminds me of how dangerous a grenade is underwater!
Now you know desten wouldn’t like that Edit: grammar
Nice video bro love from India
I wish Dan would return 😭
Surprised Phantom hasn’t lent you one of the new TMX cameras yet Gav
Nice 👍
Gav you look so 90s in this video
Gav is having a midlife crisis with the hair
I miss Dan.. Hope you can get back together soon.♥️
Very interesting, thank you 😊
I’m still waiting for Dan to come back
I want that submarine model !
I'm actually curious how much the flood lights warm up the water inside of the tank
Slo Mo guys 2069 - destroying a planet in slow motion
Jay without Silent Bob 😂
What will happen if a bomb explode in the epoxy?
Thought this was a real submarine at first lol
2 minutes ago gang, where you at?
Nice to see his beard has moved to his head.
Das Boot
At first I thought it was real lol
Why does the thumbnail looks like from gta 5....
Whatever happened to Dan?
The sub didn't fit the tank 😂
Anybody know how Dan is
Cool
The beard is no more
Early bird gets the Slow Mo video!! woot!
I miss Dan! Gav can you at least have a cardboard cut out of Dan in all your videos, till you guys unite.
Finally got some nice weather in England and I can enjoy in the sun👍
You look like you aged backwards.
Rather appropriate, looks like a German U-Boat
I love how the thumbnail looks like Subnautica. That’s not a bad thing, I mean I love Subnautica, but it looks strange.
This is a submechanophobe's worst nightmare lol.
I love things going boom, especially in slow mo
Long time no see, big fans!
Gav looking like a pro skater😂
Gav paying tribute to Dude where’s my car
Dropping everything I'm doing to watch this!
Never clicked so fast
Hello
*Dan will return someday*
early enough to find my comment?  XD
Gav really has got hair now, huh?
Omg this is dope!!
They have the most CREATIVE content!
47 here
It’s just the slow mo guy now
Pretty cool
I just checked my notifications and it didn't have anything new or exciting. then I clicked again and I saw this video.
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me...
Oh hay
Can YouTubers schedule uploads for a specific time? I just had two new uploads
What happened to dan
Oh yes
I'm convinced Gavin is just a dude that loves to snowboard who just happened to windup where he is.
That's a juicy sponsorship.  Good for you guys.
This video is insane!! Thanks for this :^)
Looks like British joe dirt
He finally shaved!!!
"Not a real submarine, those are rather expensive"  Almost sounds like Gavin looked into purchasing a real submarine.
First
I miss Dan
O no, its shaggy
7th
Half of the  king has returned :0
I thought it would be a real one. Still cool still cool
Gav respond to me
Not first, but early. Hello Gav.
So satisfying
I’ve missed this look of Gavin reminds me of the time where he still wore the bacon scarf
Wow that is actually interesting
