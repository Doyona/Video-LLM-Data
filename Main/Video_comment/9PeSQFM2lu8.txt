Rico Lewis was never a pen bro. Absolutely shocking ref
that went downhill from 7 nil to 1-1
Another golden opportunity is going to be lost by England. They’ve got a mix of brilliant young and experienced players being led by a manager with a total lack of creativity and courage. Watching the slow and totally predictable build up combined with a culture of never taking risks is absolutely frustrating. Southgate has many strengths, he’s always been an example of an elite sportsman that plays the game fairly, but he’s the wrong guy for England at this time.
Ridiculous for that penalty
Before the game even started I said to myself harry maguire will do at least one stupid thing where he’d either lose the ball or give away in a dangerous spot and will out the whole team under pressure and inevitably he did it haha then tackled the guy to the ground hahahaha and for reasons I’d never know he somehow escaped penalty. As long as this gigantic headed buffoon is playing we’d never ever win a tournament
For the love of Johnny Depp (me) get Maguire out and play Guehi and Stones at the Euros.
What a pathetic display from the overpaid self absorbed luvvies wearing the England strip .. football was once a mans game .. now look at what we’ve got 😂😂😂😂
VAR once again ruins a match
Maguire.....WHY? WHY? WHY? smh....................................
Dion Dublin's chatting rubbish saying it wasnt a Macadonia penalty.What does it even matter if the foul wasnt on the lower body? Mcguire clearly pushed the player over by pushing the upper body.If or when Dublin watches this back,he'll realize how stupid he sounded.Biased is not the word.
Rico Henry fault we lost
Gareth Southgate masterclass
Southgates misguided loyalty to Maguire will cost us any chance we have of winning anything ever. Is he shagging his sister or something?
I'd rather have a pile of horseshit at CB instead of fucking maguire
Maguire is so fking awful.
"He contact is with the upper body not the lower body" if you challenge the upper body when the ball is on the ground, don't make contact with the ball but make contact with the player, all whilst in the penalty. He then goes on to say "I don't think that's a penalty". Sums up English commentary when watching England. Afterward you then hear the Manager praising the teams performance for drawing 1-1 against North Macedonia. Granted Macedonia shocked Italy once but we are talking about a team we beat 7-0 at Old Trafford, a team that lost 3-1 at home to Azerbaijan. Maybe I'm expecting too much of them but if we continue like this nothing is coming home anytime soon lol
sorry but Maguires was a clear pen , Dion Dublin on the pills again  can't be a pen it was his body ,, what a heap of shite to talk  clear pen
Maybe a classic case of the ref realising he got it wrong and balancing things out with the pen decision
😂😂😂😂😂 the absurdity for saying mcguires push wasn’t a penalty 😂😂😂😂😂
Well done Harry Kane for the goal
Embarrassing display from us.
Opinions differ. I happen to like Southgate as England manager. Ok he's NOT WON ANYTHING, but 1/4 final semi finals & final aint bad going. So hes qualified for Euros 2024 and finished top with two games to spare. His last two matches were effectively glorified friendlies and I would hate it if a player from my team made a full blooded 50-50 challenge and got injured in a game like that  However  I can understand fans frustrations, the England shirt should be worn with pride.  As for Southgate, when he makes statements about being ranked no1 in the World then rests his captain and and only  draws with North Macedonia he leaves himself open to  criticism. In conclusion I'd rather be European Champions than ranked no1 in the World, just hope that happens.
He looked where he was a split second before he elbowed him in the face. Maguire one was also a stonewall penalty. I'm glad I didn't watch this game. France won 14 - 0 the other day...
Harry Maguire, the saviour of Manchester United and England doing Harry Maguire things again. How was that not a penalty????
Back to minimum wage factory job tomorrow these lads ain’t a clue about passion and fight international football is garbage waste of time viewing figures must be horrendous
This is why lower league  football in 10 years will be so popular, people are just getting sick to the stomach of watching this VAR crap
France 🇫🇷 win 14-0 .. meanwhile  England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 draw 1-1 ..  🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 Sack Southgate and you guys might stand a chance 💯💯💯
England wants to be number 1 but have a shit manager 😂 too funny😊
"THE MAN BEHIND THE MASK "?BY PROF WALTER VEITH POWERFUL POWERFUL WATCH TRUTH ALWAYS WINS ❤
“Maguires never let England down” ye because he gets away with stupid stuff like that
Can't believe there's not more talk bashing how awful England was. It was North Macedonia. Should be winning 0 - 4 with a B team
I'm just glad I was at Old Trafford to see the 7-0 and not this
In my opinion North Macedonia are a much better team than people give them credit for.
Maguire is not England material!!
"Maguire never lets England down". Gives the ball away under no pressure and then rugby challenges in his box.
VAR has spoiled football never a penalty
Well the ref should be sacked 😂 how Rico was a pen but Maguire wasn’t is beyond me
LOL I HAVE NO WORDS LMAO
It was only a month ago they (the overpaid pundits) were saying England were the best team in the world but the reality is we can’t beat North Macedonia away.
Whats so controversial.
Garth Crooks needs to shut the hell up and that title is ridiculous. The Maguire tackle was a penalty and the Lewis arm slap was a pen. Both nailed on yet only 1 was given. Lucky to remain unbeaten, you can support your team and not blindly call every decision in your favour, good god man.
Best team since 86?
Talk about inconsistent officiating, nonetheless England are still an embarrassment under Southgate
Not just the penalty decisions but the wole match the referee was completely out of his depth.
I'd be surprised if that referee is put I'm charge of another game the level of mistakes are comical
Who the f is Rico Lewis?
The blatant bias with these commentators is absolutely hilarious! 😂😂 If that was a foul on England, you wet sausages would be screaming “PENALTY” all day long mate! 😂
VAR NEEDS TO LEAVE THE GAME RUINS EVERY ASPECT OF THE GAME
I say again why does Maguire still play for England
And that penalty..there..is proof what is wrong with today's game..Lewis makes the slightest of touches..and a young..fit athlete posing as a footballer hits the deck as if hed been punched full on in the face..fecking disgraceful..I'm getting so sick of this ' gamesmanship  ...
This commentary bias bad kmt
Team played as bad as the ref
France put 14 past a team and England muster up the courage score one lol
N Mac look very decent
Maguire is not safe in a football kit and should not be playing for England
Jesus christ, what is it actually going to take to get rid of this slabheaded oaf
well as this clueless commentator said, it was all "upper body". Guess you can just spear someone in the box and get away with it then
How is that a pen
This was like watching paint dry and dion Dublin on comentary was embarressing , you can't white wash what was a terrible performance too slow no urgency and hardly any effort the sooner Southgate is gone the better.
‘I don’t think that’s a penalty’ honestly the English commentators would side with their national team over their own mother. Biased to the max
Maguire pushes attacker over  Commentator: Definitely not a pen 😅😂
the referee put me in a bad mood
Would rather Rooney over Southgate that’s how bad he is 🍩
Look at how France did Gibraltar, England ain't winning nothing
Maguire you better not cock up on Sunday
Maguire proves again that Southgate’s an absolute helmet
That game was pathetic
Bojan Miovski is outstanding, great first touch, good off the ball, holds it up well and a good finisher. Only gripe is he sometimes goes for a chip or the spectacular rather than a simple finish. Be playing at the top level in Germany or similar in a couple of years (you know, leagues that still have integrity). He's improved massively at Aberdeen and will only get better.  Also he hit him in the face. That's a penalty. You would expect a foul anywhere else on the pitch for that.
😂🤣😂"the contact was upper body  so not a penalty".  Dublin's commentary was worse than the decision
Konsa should sue Southgate for wasting his time
Didn't know the MK Dons were vsing England
Maguire is so slow idk if anyone else notices how much he slows our attack down when passing from the back just pass it quicker you fridge he gives the opponent time to reposition and mark all our players.
Even the highlights were boring
Seriosly you no kand bit Macedonia and you want to win mondial and euro never
how was that a pen!!!!
The kids holding the players hands on the way out should have played instead might have seen a bit of quality on the pitch but what can you expect when the manager is Southgate  says it all
I will say it now the Fridge will cost England Euro 2024
This team is full of very talented and attacking young players. That is the issue. We dont have a mature homding midfielder who can cement the midfield and defence.
I used to love watching Grealish play when he was at Villa, when he seemed to have the freedom to entertain, Southgate has certainly turned him into a typical England player
Maguire is a donkey his was a penalty without a doubt unlucky on the other lad but being a spurs fan I'm used to dodgy penalty decisions
Englandets slagging off Scotland for drawing in  a friendly and here they are making an absolute Women’s Front of it again!! 🤣🤣🤣
I know we have qualified but I will give anyone 100/1 on England winning a major tournament every day of the week
Hahahaha how embarrassing yet again for england 😂
People still paid extortionate amounts to kick a ball around. 🤡 planet.
We won't win anything under Southgate, such exciting and top quality players in this England team yet Southgate plays the most boring defensive football 🤮 he also has his favourites and won't play the best in form players in the league
'Footballs coming home' - every f'in year - what a load of 🎈🎈
England need a penalty to win against North Macedonia, says it all really.
TAA is not boss at pinging balls....
Maguire continues to be an embarrassment. It’s not just the clear penalty, have a look at his pass at 1:35. He did something very similar in the last game that left us wide open from a non-threatening situation. It’s hard to believe this is anything but deliberate.
Football is laughably terrible, the officiating is so poor. Absolute shambles of a sport 😅
Maguire is getting worse, you can see his lack of confidence,poderous,slow,its like his in another world,...its ok standing by players when having a hard time,...but Maguire,for his own sake needs dropping.....also the ref performance was the worst I have seen in 40yrs,shocking,nearly as bad as Dublins commentary!!!!!!!!!
Kane is an absolute legend for English football. What a guy
I painted a wall at half time, then spent the next 45 minutes watching it dry, it was more exciting.
Dublin needs to take his England spectacles off before commentating…clear fouls both times no question..
If you haven't read the comments, do so! 😂😂😂😂😂
Only Southgate could fail to pick the number one current in form goalscorer in Europe right now, in Harry Kane, who is absolutely on fire, and comes on and scores with his first touch... Maybe he, Southgate, should go into politics, he's well qualified!
What kind of referee have North Macedonia been finding 💀
Maguire proves again he has no place in this team. Southgate is more interested in looking after this clown than being a competent manager? I hope we get knocked out in group stages as they will have to replace him. If we make it far in the competition they will keep him. Everyones is more worried about hurt feelings than being successful? Whats happened to football?
I know Southgate loves Pickford but why not give another keeper a cap? The group is already won
"The contact is with upper body, not the lower. That's not a penalty." What absolute nonsense. McGuire pushed the guy over in the box. It doesn't matter what part of his body he used.
Ignoring the penalty, not exactly world class football from England. ‘Must do better’ (and a hell of a lot)
Rubbish rubbish utter rubbish. Aint gonna win nothing playing like this
Dion Dublin is embarrassing! Maguire's was definitely a penalty! And the rest of the stuff he comes out with
Can’t wait for the bubble to burst so we can go back to simple football at it’s beautiful best
How can ABYBODY outside England say N Macedonia should of had pen in 23rd ..what is dion Dublin watching . ..and sorry that was a penalty too . 100% get a fecking grip you one eyed bias clowns
2 games in a row Harry Maguire has had an absolute nightmare lol how is Pickford still number 1 as well
England eh? you can see why they never, ever, win anything. Mediocre at very best and always massively overrated by their own brainless fans.
Stonewaller so was the McGuire rugby tackle
awful performance from the ref lmao maguire one was definitely a pen, lewis one definitely wasnt. also, Maguire has had a good few games for united and now hes back to his usual dumbassery
Boring England.
I still don't understand how Maguire still finds himself in an England jersey. He's shocking and needs dropping.
Imagine england actually had a decent manager, they would be seriously hard to beat even by the big teams, however with southgate we will always remain best of the rest, bang average manager with a great squad under him…
Is not bard-hi is Bardhi as in bar-thee. Is an ethnic Albanian surname. It means white
Why Maguire still playing for England?
Since England's matches have been channel 4 , England have gone downhill. I blame the guardian readers
Lions led by a double donkey combo’ of Maquire and Southgate.
The media and Southgate will never learn.
Dion Dublin is a 💩 pundit
Even Maguires own teammates cannot stand him. Watch their body language. How can that not be a pen when it would be a foul anywhere else on the pitch. Donut commentator.
So Dublin is arguing that if the contact is upper body not lower body its not a foul???  Boy where do they find these 'experts'??
Every game, Maguire gives the ball away with poor passes. HOW THE FK is he in the national team and still at Man U? Which Man U fan can see him playing with Giggs, Scholes, Vidic  and Evra?
Anyone think there may be a link between a dull and uninspiring team and a dull and uninspiring manager?
Dublin be quiet. He smacks the man in the face. Its a penalty plain and simple Doh
Absolute crap top to bottom. Worst manager in last 25 years with zero fucking chance of winning next year!!!
Can anyone explain the comment about contact with the upper half of the body not being a penalty?
Nothing wrong with the ref giving a penalty for the Lewis challenge, it was to make up for the Maguire howler that he had before that.
southgate is trash and with that guy france will win . he is a shit his team selector,  it is trash . England is not winning anything under him. ben gordon and jude has the same attitude push fight saka is a hot girl he dont fight for the ball. watkins is over rated he is trash. how many touches this guy had all game? see france play the stars regardless of opponent. why was harry not starting where is reece james where is sterling. England WILL go trophy less another year under him. who disagreee lets put money on it.
This fan base does my head in. We were all finally in a good place following World Cup 2018. We knew that we weren’t the best in the world and went into the tournament with reasonable expectations (for once) and we all absolutely delighted to get all the way to the semis.   Then we went into the euros with a bit more expectation and excitement that games were being played at Wembley. We got to the final of the euros and everybody was very happy with what they’d seen.  Then last years World Cup we were one of the heavy favourites but we were knocked out by a very good team in a game that could’ve gone either way and everybody was fair in their reaction and accepted that these things happen.  Fast forward to now and people are losing their minds because we only beat Malta by two and draw North Macedonia in dead rubber games that do not matter what so ever. Let’s all collectively get a grip, get behind the team and get excited about the upcoming tournament instead of being a bunch of miserable killjoys.
boring boring southgate.  get him out
How that was a poenalty for Macedonia is beyond me.  If that was a penalty then so was the one agianst Kane on Sundey.  Think they made it up for the foul by McGuire.  No penalty there but the same thing is doen by another England player outside the box and the ref blows for a foul!!
Maguire made that very same mistake with the pass in the last game but got away with it, he will really cost us one day, he is a fekking liability
Is it controversial because NM didn't get the Maguire pen? Or because Dion Dublin thinks smacking someone in the face in the box is fine? Intention has nothing to do with it, exactly the same as with handball etc etc.
So it seems this virus affecting premiership referees has crossed into Europe. If your local referee completely forgets the rules of football, cant put a line in the right place, stares vacantly at tv screens for far too long, please get him to an isolation ward ASAP. We cant have the Euros polluted with this stupidity!
North Macedonia v a team of English strangers picked by the venerable Mr Tickerman, can anybody name any matches this person has picked the same team twice ? . Kalvin Phillips plays his second or third 6 min match this year,. This team of misfits according to the clown pundits Dublin and Cole are the No 1 team,  of what ? tiddley winks
Why does anyone bother watching England? They’re dull as fook, the manager hasn’t got a scooby and has no clue how to counter any opposing managers mid game changes. Yawn fest, like all international football.
bad game.with th opponent?really bad
Dion Dublin has to be one worst commentators, how can he say Harry Maguire's is not a penalty it's a stone wall one. The Ref messed up so badly on it that any contact in box literally any contact in box against a MKD player would have been given as a penalty.
Watched first time round it was awful
Co commentator typically unprofessional and idiotic.
Maguire def fouled the guy after the giving the ball away. And you knew he was going to give it away before he even kicked it. If anybody can explain to me how Maguire deserves a place in the England team  I'd love to hear it.
Let me get this straight: The mighty England, made up of a squad of players who earm £millions- EACH, supposedly playing in the best league in the world, are held to a draw by a team from from a country of 1.8 million people, ranked 66th in the world. How proud their parents must be.....
Why has Alexander-Arnold The Great been handed the Number 10 shirt? That is sacred number in football.
Swear Maguire is the missing member of the Addams family.
Im sick of listening to that 🤡 Dion Dublin.....hes so biased its unreal.
There is a lot of talk about Maguire and how he is the weak link in the team, he isn't. Gareth Southgate is the weak link and that's coming from a Boro fan.
Fair play to North Macedonia for digging in and getting a point. Can't blame Southgate for giving his second string a try out against weak opposition with qualification secured, but these two games show they really need to work on getting some decent players who can substitute for Kane et al.
the playing on a plastic pitch or the clueless Refereeing did not help this game from an entertainment point of view. Rico Lewis had a good game, well done Rico Lewis. You have to ask if the introduction of new FIFA Referees includes the reading of a rule book. I came to the conclusion that the competition is desperate to keep contenders from less experienced teams and the Referee was paid to promote this ?. The advertising for the  addition of VAR referees perhaps givers everyone a clue on the mindless interpretation of the rules by organisers FIFA, FA and more , this has now lead to no-one wanting the job.  1/The offside rule must change , offside by toe nails decisions is ridiculous let alone poor lopsided camera angles.Anyone knowing about the body movement would know this is not an advantage , just a poorly thought out Gimmick ruining good entertainment. 2/ obvious late challenges an instant yellow or retrospective yellow on VAR review  3/ the referee must not be surrounded by players on decision making The two directly involved only or a yellow card issued. The referees must be allowed to do the job without intimidation. 4/ the same consistent camera views for all gamers A MUST !. 5/ Penalty rules changed with a proper re think , simply stupid and causes various ridiculous interpretations. 6/ one referee training centre  in  several top Team  countries , for all Referees] training , providing  consistency in that training before becoming a FIFA or top league referee. Much more but hey we are left with a repetitive shambles and blind leadership.
Rashford needs to go. Stirling in.
Maguire what a clown
Gareth Southgate is the reason this England team isn’t going to win anything 💀
Maguire gives defo pen. Commentator says he didn't connect with players bottom half, he pushed him above waist. WHAT!!!! So if I flying kick a player in the stomach in the box it's not a pen cause didn't connect with the players legs. That surely not a real rule commentator. England keep saying This don't matter. Its what happens at big tournaments that counts. Well when England draw or lose to a similar ranked team as N.Mac then I will need to be committed cause my hysterical laughter will never cease.
That referee 🤦🏻‍♂️😂😂
Check that refs bank account for any mysterious payment’s in from a Macedonian account. He was a big bag of horse excrement, I bet he even wore a red shirt under his black one. 🤬🤬
Dion Dublin needs a new pair of Gregory Pecks. What an absolute idiot
That pen is legit. he thought he was flappy bird
Get ya sax out dion wish you could turn the commentary off
Last time we bagged 9 against these lot so how r we drawing?
Maguire is a curse to England winning a cup
Can’t even score from open play. Complaining about penalises against farmers 😂😂
how the  fuck is Maguire still in the England squad all he does is mess up and cost us him and Southgate need to be gone
On paper one of the best England teams …. In the field there shocking
Rubbish England you must improve when you see teams Like France 14-0 win
How can you that’s not a pen ??? Maguire pushes him over 😂😂
We’re so lucky to have Southgate as national coach, I’m sure we’re the envy of world football😂
1:36  I can't lie Maguire does this ALL THE TIME
Get rid of VAR. Referees are just as moronic and blind watching a slow motion replay as a match in real time.
Maguire is terrible, I don’t get why Southgate continues to pick him and Henderson. The talent we’ve got is going to waste. I rate what Southgate has done but it’s time for someone new.
Even i see now, that Southgate is not a winning manager. We want trophies and to win. Southgate just lacks that edge or that spark that we need. Our players are top notch, but because of Southgates style or system, the creativity, the intuition of these players is really not being utilised to the best. Unfortunately i think England may not win a trophy with these players under Southgate. I would love to be proved wrong.
What a shocker, the bookies had a field day rinsing everyone. No corruption in football though.😂
I guess we can be relieved it wasn't the whole of Macedonia, only the North.  South Macedonia have some good players.
Expect nothing from this team until the absolutely useless manager leaves
Maguire has given the ball away cheaply twice in two consecutive games against low level teams 🥲
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂what a  joke , we have missed 2 weeks of proper football to watch England play Malta and Macedonia!  Come on man !!
Maguires loose passes are nothing new despite Southgate claiming he's never put a foot wrong for England. He will play in the euros, have a couple of howlers and we'll exit early and Southgate will be replaced two years too late
Who’s the clown commentating saying he doesn’t think it’s a penalty because he challenges the upper body? Who are they hiring
Technically the Maguire one was not a pen because it was upper body contact (i.e. 'shoulder to shoulder'). But even if it was a normal looking shoulder barge there was no chance of him winning the ball, and so should've been a pen
Thought Macedonia would have beaten these overrated numpties...World beaters who hadn't one shot on target against Malta in the first 45 minutes...bring on the finals..😂
Amatures
As an English man born and bred CONGRATULATIONS to N Macedonia you deserved to win all the players we have in this country  we get maguire & kane just to name a couple watched dag & red better team than we have
We are a joke of a team, why is even maguire in this team man giving the ball away and clearly taking down a player in box which was a definite pen, Rico Lewis pen was a atrocious decision #Southgateout
The commentators are so biased that it’s sickening
Dion Dublin needs to get to F'kin specsavers
How the hell does Mr Potato head HM get in that team ? Southgate is an absolute 🤡
Maguire challenge before that was a penalty.
Agree the ref was a nonce ! Power crazed wannabe ! But our performance was dier ! We should be winning games like that with ease & scoring goals ! Southgate just hasn't got the tactical awareness of other international coaches ...he has a make do mentality & that is not enough to win anything ! If France had been playing them they would have torn them apart !
Highlights surely  that's against  the trade description  act
If we struggle against Malta & Macedonia just wait till the top teams come along, Maguire shouldn't be playing he is useless, he was lucky with that challenge & that ref was a joke.
1-1 it`s okey
Harry maguire really isn’t international standard it’s kind of embarrassing
What a bloody shame! Same jokers are playing. Change fucking England manager and replace good players. All loosers are playing............😂😂😂
Southgate out
Ref took a bung on this one
Didn't even realise England played lool
Crazy how nationally you can berate officials non stop but when it comes to the prem, god forbid someone has an objection against VAR and PGMOL. 🤐
Bloody penalty all day - what are the English like - arrogant and deluded! It was an assault FFS!
Two clear penalties... anywhere in the world... even in the premiership.... bad  commentators...
Yep and favourites to win euro 2024 , pmsl
It's not just Maguire giving the ball away. It's what he does next. He panics and runs towards the ball like a 6yr old drawn like a magnet when there's already a covering defender.Then he's got to play catch-up and blatantly fouls the fwd. 3 schoolboy mistakes in about 6 seconds.
Playing so slow that even a team of tortoises would give the a good game that's down to the manager to mutch play in own half do they know you have to put ball in their opponents goal to win games
Maguire is just embarrasing. They want the critics to stop but how can you fucking ignore that? At this point the only way to protect him is to remove him. He can't help himself. Awful ball and then awful tackle which should have been a penatly. How can we win anything if that's against a decent side? The rest of the team are affected too.
This is all great tournament prep. Southgate has obviously told the team to make sure Pickford gets some practice saving pens, ready for the tournament next summer. Maguire tried his best to give him a chance to save one, good on him, but since that wasn't given, Lewis had to take one for the team as well. Proper 4D chess going on here.
Boreing football and grelish stood there doing his fancy footwork and not getting anywhere with it. We sterling back i think
Cos the government look into it they no these people are liars that's why waller Liberal Democrats bloke gave me a letter what the council said cos he was laughing cos he new there liars council and these people
Most shocking thing about Maguire (not) penalty was his positioning after he gave away the ball, literally backs way up into Lewis's space and gifts the run of the box to the attacker.
I thought N Macedonia humiliated England before they were the better team. For all the possession,  England was unable to create enough clear cut chances to win the game. Grealish on the left was all show and no substance when he needed to get to the byeline he cut into the crowded area resulting in nothing.  Lewis was unfortunate and the refereee had a very poor game.
Dion Dublin has no idea about football rules. How the Harry Maguire foul not a pentalty is his opinion i will never know. In addition, commentators should learn players names before the game. You have one job, to talk about the match. Its not pronounced Bard-Hi 👋👋, its pronounced Bard-Hee. You have one job!! 🤦
Shockingly poor referee
Who can we drop to get Raheem Sterling in the Squad? Gareth Southgate.
"he has caught him with his upper body. that's not a penalty" ...... oh, so a rugby tackle is allowed now is it ? lets sign jonah lomu, no one will score against us then surely ......... and while i think the actual penalty is on the harsh side the comentator (dion dublin i think ) he still tries to play it off. just hilariously biased to the point of stupidity. mcguire should have been sent off too, though what he is doing on the pitch in the first place is beyond me. i mean we couldn't even score, we needed macedonia to help with that ffs
Southgate is the best coach in the world! 😂 He will win many trophies with England!
Both penalties really. Maguire mistimes, tries to pull out, and body checks the attacker; Lewis catches him in the face. There is no 'nothing in it' for catching someone in the face like there are grades of challenge for the ball on the ground - it's a pen. "He's not even looking" - there have been calls to have more ex-pros on VAR, but many of them don't even know the rules.
We haven't got a left back?
Southgate is the perfect glazers manager fkn shite get rid now!!!!!
Are England going to be in the euros
Fifa is a corrupt organisation a true fact, and referees a part of that organisation can only lead to one thing... Is England great? No. But the " home of association football" Fifa is always biased against England, so other teams have an advantage against us. It's the  same during Euros, CL, and europa cups, the Euro teams decisions are always dubious against us. Fifa should be ashamed. I stopped watching football when England bent the knee, Southgate is a Cnut. But the bias from European refs is untenable. Do I support England? Not any more. I do hate euro bias though........ and Fifa ARE CORRUPT 🖕🏻
I can't believe I thought it would be a good idea to watch it in the pub. I thought it would be a good atmosphere plenty of England goals. how wrong I was. What a disgrace .
Maguire is so bad you’d think he’s a member of Parliament.
Watched 10 minutes, turned off due to usual boring predictable England play!  We have amazing talent, managed by a defender - and it looks it. Sorry, but we need to change asap. It’s our greatest chance to win something and unfortunately I don’t think Southgate will be the one!
Pub teams.
Lol
I generally like D Dublins contributions   But he is way off the mark and blaming the ref for a vvv poor England performance is rubbish.   Maguire giving away the ball with NO pressure and NM should have had a pen.  Also Louis ( stunning talent) incident was a penalty
Never a penalty maguire foul was a pen England are on the up if they can get the defence tighter and keep everyone is fit and the media dont start hype talking about the England players like they did with beckham and gazza  which just adds pressure on the players they can win the tournament .i hope Southgate  plays his best team from the squad  which he didnt in Europe final against Italy  or at times in the world cup but he and the F.a have done a good Job in the last 10 years or so to bring talent through Foden is a monster not to mention Bellingham and Rice. There is something about this team they may not play entertaining football every game and people have to realise how much the other teams have improved  But they have so much quality .never in my life have English player been in demand from Foreign clubs there has always been top british players playing abroad like John charles Kevin Keegan Paul Gascoigne Gary Lineker  but now virtually the whole team are wanted abroad .you got 4 gazza's in that team England are no longer  ten players and one superman.
Another appalling performance. England are absolutely rubbish, and have a manager who's brings out the  very worst in his players. That they've gone so far in recent tournaments says all you need to know about the dreadful standard of nations currently. International football is the most mind numbing dross out there.
Im sorry but shit referees aside under southgate england aren't winning nothing its slow side to side passing jude bellingham's stock goes up even when he doesn't play because if he isn't fit in the summer england have major issues he's the only one apart from foden who looks likely when defences are packed behind the ball also would be very concerned if kane got injured cuz the back up is levels below and imo not national level
Maguire is a poor player and should never be in the England squad....BUT a rubbish manager is to blame, England will not go far in any competition whilst this manager is in charge, so don't waste money following this lot. England were lucky not to loose to a no hope team..
The commentating through the whole game was cringe. "Dublin: it's a good job that wasn't a yellow because he could of had a yellow earlier but he didn't..."  One of many nuggets of fart
Rubbish
Crap management, crap team selection treating it like a friendly, crap refereeing - game's gone.
First time ever i'm really starting to fear for the game if its being re-refereed constantly. Its becoming more and more prevelant, what happened to the VAR only to be used for the glaring mistakes. It should harldy be used and yet its mirco managing everything, just flipping get on with it, play the game. VAR should be used for the 100% mistakes. Take the Maguire foul, you've seen them given, you've seen them not given. leave it. anything 50/50 or 80/20 etc the onfield decision sticks. anything 100% wrong VAR gets involved that is it. Why do they seem to be unable to stick to this approach?
Well done to "North" (they have no right to use "Macedonia").  McGuire very lucky not to give away a pen after his atrocious pass, then bundling the striker over (Dublin talking mince). It was a clear pen that was then given for North. 1st England "goal" was clearly offside so well done VAR. England can consider themselves lucky to even get a draw.
"The contact is with the upper body, not the lower body. I don't think that's a penalty."  I honestly didn't know you could just rugby tackle someone's back in football and as long as it's their back and not their legs it's fine. That's why I'm not a commentator I suppose.
Seriously what is it with so many England fans saying that we have the best players in the world. We don't. Kane and Bellingham is it. These judgements are born out of entitlement. It's what makes the years of failure and disappointment so richly deserved.
Ended up switching off 1st half was so boring.
Dion Dublin… One word… Specsavers!!!
The commentators are just too biased on channel 4
This is what VAR is all about 😂
McGuire is a league 2 level player...
😂😂😂😂😂  what a fcuking shambles,  how saka gets in front of sterling in the squad i don't know, he's lost it, Trent was awful, Maguire 😂😂, midfield lost without Bellingham.
Time to go Gareth simple as
Once more, England was exposed, when it doesn't have the the referee help, it doesn't  win games. BTW North Macedonia was robbed one penalty, otherwise it would win the game. Shame on you england
This is no Macedonia!  Bastards stole the name
are these commentetors just biased? bro he whacked him in the head with his hand. last time i checked you cant even handle a ball with that. you can handle someones else's face? Dumb. Its a penalty. just cos you cant score more than 1 goal against them doesnt mean its wrong. Sorry dude
Maguire is the protected one why he's in the squad is beyond me
That was the biggest bent is I have ever seen e wood not do the under five foot ball
Biased ass commentator for such an overrated team
Wtf is going on with football. If you watch that on var and give a penalty, you should not be allowed anywhere near a football field
Southgate + Maguire = Failure
If Southgate continues with his loyalty card for Maguire, it will be his downfall, and England.
Southgate out, out of his depth. Look at his cv. Imaging giving pep this team ….
To put it mildly the last two matches have been crap, an embarrassment to football.
Forget the penalty on Lewis for a minute and the fact that Maguire should have given away a pen: In my opinion the Ref has recieved some sort of N Macedonia mafia payment. Throughout the entire game his decisions were so biased! Not taking away N Macedonia performance they played out of their skins, England were average.
Bias commentary is shocking the clown saying I don't think that's a pen against SLABHEAD is ridiculous.🤣
Maguire first on the team sheet for next year. Outstanding performance.
Lol
22 minutes, Maguire plays a really bad cross field pass and then tries to amend by fouling in the box. No penalty because Maguire waves a finger at the referee. Unbelievable
Are Southgate and Maguire related.....???? How is he still in the team
Boring,bland, no thrust going forward  the centre halves have no vision to many times players in acres of space ignored we will not win the euros or the world Cup for that matter,Southgate is a waste of space he is ruining a team full of talent.
Dion complaining about everything decision of the ref
Channel 4 have learned from ITV how to be spineless. I recall the days when England going over to Eastern Europe was always a nasty tie. North Macedonia are a useful team (I believe they helped knock Italy out of the last World Cup in the group stages), but the officials appear to be looking to get England beaten. History suggests that when England go away to these places the conditions are set against them, and the opposition is usually allowed to get away with everything.  I believe if UEFA had their way, teams like North Macedonia would be qualifying for the finals.
How are people saying us for winning the euros. Controversy or not I wouldn’t like beating these if the penalty was given
Maguire was awful
Maguire standing on the ball continually for five or six seconds as if he is a world class player, slows it all down, get him out along with negative Southgate.
ENGLAND will not win a raffle  they are going backwards just like the passing struggled against Malta the put 7 passed Macedonia last time and got a lucky draw this time
Rico was punished for Harry's stupidity
Southgate chatting about the no 1 world ranking before this. If I'd travelled as a England fan on a Monday nite I know I'd never make that mistake again. Jokers!
Why won’t Walker pass to Saka. He would rather go backwards in fact he always goes backwards
Another game where the ref hates England.. And var... O MY GOD..... How does it take 3 minutes to see if they are offside. I'm a woman and I could see straightaway the goal would be disallowed cause he was offside..
NORTH MACEDONIA MENTIONED RAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Ma
I love how southclown give rico and palmer who haven't played much prem footy there debut but never even give konsa a shot who has one of the best defense stats in prem
Most bias commentator ever
How the commentator dont think thats a penalty too is beyond disbelief.
Even at international level the refs and VAR are f***ing up. The maguire incident wasn't a penalty, and neither was the Lewis one. I hope that ref is never given another international match to officiate again.
maguire was a pen, lewis not a pen, regardless england were woeful. made macedonia look mid table prem
Top 5 performances of the night:  1 - Harry Maguire 2 - The referee 3 - England 4 - Dion Dublin on commentary 5 - VAR
Jesus H C chaps, just relax, a lot of these comments from emotive armchair footy managers calling for sacking GS or have this or that guy in the team. Good managers see this as an opportunity to try a few new things .. These things happen in a 'non-game' like this .. Was this the first team= NO, Was it a vital game = NO .. so shut the F U and enjoy the fact that England is top and reached another comp' with ease.. No pleasing anyone FFS !!!!
Maguireball: A mix between football, wrestling, and rugby.
Southgate will never win a tournament.
Ref had a shocker. England had a shocker. Nothing to lose in this fixture but not the game we needed with that performance.
Lewis didn't commit a foul but gave away a penalty, but Maguire wiped out a player never touched the ball, how does VAR struggle with such clear incidents.
Never in a million years was that a penalty⁉️ feel a bit bad for Rico Lewis 😢 That ref was terreble👎🤮🙅‍♂️
How was Harry Maguire’s not a penalty?!
England are embarrassing.
That performance was poor, and that's kind.  Maguire should be working at the circus.
Can moan its controversial all you want. In what world, does Macedonia hold a team like England with the players they have!! Blame Southgate for his shit boring tactics that under uses the firepower England have.
VAR is a joke
To many slick ricks and not enogh Rooneysssssssss!!!!!!!
Then there’s France 7/7 wins 27 goals + 26 GD.
You can tell this ref had never ref'ed a game before this one , he hadn't a clue what he was doing and neither did the VAR team , Maguire is well past his best , he looks like an 80 yr old with his pace and everyone is running past him like he wasn't even there
Only Dion Dublin thought that Maguire challenge wosnt a penalty 😂😂
England are proving time and again that they're not gonna get a sniff of winning the euros...they have this mentality of thinking they just have to turn up and the games theirs ...the last 2 performances have stunk rank rotten...and with or without the Bellinghams or grealishes of the world England will laughed out of Germany.....
Shame for Lewis, thought he looked a brilliant player otherwise
Sorry Maguire is a liability now. Pass back Jack is not much better. Rice is looking more confident as is Foden.
Thank god we have Kane because the rest of our strikers are shocking
Maguire 😂 Gives the ball away and then could have easily conceded a pen moments later. He really is the gift that keeps on giving.
Thank goodness maguire is living up to his normal standards
This is a team that said in the papers yesterday that they're aiming to be ranked 1st in the world.... a team that struggled against Malta and drew against North Macedonia 😂😂😂
International football is absolute pony compared to club football.
France 14  v  Malta 0... Enough said.
I can’t believe English commentators, I’ve been 14 years working in Sports Tv in London and this still amazes me 🤣   Both were clear penaltis!
Old slabhead and pinocchio just keep on giving
Nobody is talking about the wholesome link up at the end of Phillips and alioski
England are crap they get the easiest qualifying group everytime and to draw with with teams like this how can they possibly think they might win the tournament
Maguire is rubbish
Football's coming home, my @rse! 😂
LOOOOOOL
Over 70% possession yet only two shots on goal... against a very weak side. The England men's team or just so crap, IMO. Southgate is not as good as his pundit chums says he is. Eddie Howe should be next manager, and sooner rather than later. We'll win nothing under Southgate.
It's coming home 😂
Any chance you could have a word with Dion Dublin about his bias opinions every time there’s a penalty shout for England. Literally every time he calls it 100% a penalty or not in England’s favour and his opinions usually been wrong according to the refs hahaha
So Maguire spears fella down and it ain't a pen😂... refs at international level should be on it and not have to rely on 8 lads in a room with a TV.
Referee was dog shit !!!!!
VAR was supposed to end controversial decisions. It has completely failed. Worse still, it has completely disrupted the flow of the game. Apart from goal line decisions it should be scrapped.
I know it wasn’t a penalty but , what angers me is that he let the game play on so much after giving it.
Draw, north Macedonia 😂
Maguire needs to be dropped and Southgate needs to be sacked, I’ve had enough, what a boring game.
Maguire was a definite penalty so it all evens out anyway
Penalty all day. Cant go slapping folk in the face.
A lot of huffing and puffing I fell asleep in the second half.
Please can we file a petition to remove Harry maguire from international football
GET SOUTHWANK OUT NOW!!! WE WILL WIN NOTHING UNDER HIM!! BEST TEAM WE HAVE EVER HAD BUT THE WORST MANAGER WE HAVE EVER HAD!! I WONT WATCH ANOTHER ENGLAND GAME UNTIL HE IS GONE!!!!!!
Drew 1.1 they are shite
Dion Dublin shouldn’t be anywhere near a microphone!
This euros is clearly going to be full of soft penalties.
SOUTHGATE HAS TO GO
Disgrace to wear the shirt no heart in this performance
Nothing controversial the fact is England are shite the way they played only foden and Saka tried going forward the rest of them were defending a 1-0 lead vs Man City absolute bollox
Southgate sucks
The ref was incompetent or corrupt  var is run by buffoons also how can maguire and Rushford keep getting the shirt
Jesus Christ maguire being typical maguire shocking
Absolutely disgraceful refereeing today, he was smirking to give that penalty. Maguires challenge also was very Bad. It just felt the 50/50 challenges were swinging the way of North Macedonia. He just wanted to be a star and be strict so he might get into the euros, absolutely disgraceful.
Southgate out now, please god.
England got away with that the first penalty appeal was clearly a penalty.   The second was also and on both occasions the offending defender’s were lucky not to receive straight red’s let’s have it right.
The Maguire foul reminded me of when Boris Johnson played rugby with schoolkids and that tackle. Literally fell on him
Who cares it’s a dead rubber and a shit match. Next.
What highlights?
Southgate out.
Been saying it for years Gareth is a poor manager
As if we can’t beat these it’s  pathetic man we have one of the best squads in the tournament but we play boring football
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 and Southgate wants his team to become No1 in the world...dream on...yet more BS from the England camp...won 1 World Cup 67 years ago and still think they are world master beater...more like master baters 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can't even beat them. What chance in the euros. Got shown up again.
We'll win absolutely nothing with a clown as manager Southgate as to be the worst manager in the entire history of football
Southgate in 😅
England are so dull under Mr Dull Gareth. I still don't get why Slab Head gets anywhere near the England Squad we have so many better defenders
The quality of officials in the last two games has been unbelievable.
How was that a pen
So because it happened again where a player fell in the box it’s a pen, they did deserve the first but im so bored of these officials
Im ok with the draw ,i bet 20 quid on 1 all at 20 to one .Thanks England 😅 oh and Maguire.And z draw was the correct result  from two very poor teams.
Poor from England play like that in tournaments out
How biased is dion dublin? To say that's not a penalty on the maguire tackle is absurd. Its absolutely blatant and had that been at the other end, he'd have screamed for a penalty  Its absolutely stonewall
Maguire the lucky clown again , stonewall penalty.
Also main players were not played or used till late
I believe n felt watching it that it was fixed, English players were not trying to score at all, they were just passing it to the back all the time, I was stunned and upset
Nothing to see here...literally...easy qualification group..probably get through group stage in finals, then lose again to a half decent team...feel sorry for our brilliant supporters
Southgate 😂😂😂😂
Can we start a petition to get Southgate out, i started drifting off in the first half and fell asleep in the second, we have one of if not the best international teams and this is what ge gets out of them
Dreadful co-commentary, never shuts up.
Maguire is so bad, dont even feel sorry for him now
Fuck sake England
Last two game's, have shown that England are slipping, right enough it was a nothing game, but it's actually nice to win whoever they play.look at France...14..0...England should be doing things like that.....
Sack the manager now, this football side are truly pathetic,  ridiculous and embarrassing. 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
People still defend this absolute clown of a footballer when will people wake up.and realise hes a terrible footballer.  Absolutely stealing a living. Its beyond criminal now 😮
A pathetic performance from England as usual
This is way I don’t watch football it’s a pile of shite slightest touch go down. Go watch rugby man 100000% better sport
Its difficult to find any highlights in England's last  2 games worth watching....There is something not quite right about a team that has the best players in the world underperforming as they are...any manager would love to have a team like them and maybe we could watch some  attacking football instead of the  boring back passing that seems to be the order of the day.!!
Maguires stone wall penalty
Penalty desicion ridiculous
why do you only have blacks in your English team is it crime based if so why no Romanians Polish Muslims who were born in the UK & why are the English vanishing from football TV streets & Politics
I remember when England was mocking the Italians for not beating Macedonia. They recently beat them 6/2.
With Southgate as manager what do we expect.
I loved international break over the 4 months. Never ever got bored watching England But this game was an absolute stinker. 😆
Football is in the mud. Also, England will win nothing under Southgate or with Maguire in the side, that guy should never pull on a international shirt. Awful footballer.
Wtf is that commentary!? He made contact with the upper body not the lower body so its not a penalty. Fucking mental. Get that league 1 defender out the team.
Can't say I'm a fan off the referee either for some reason very picky and no matter what we do we get yellow cards and could done and too have VAR as well just takes the biscuit honestly I think we're p!saying better but there's some really funny referees recently didn't like the last one at all the players make mistakes so do we all but too have been like the matches just recently, I've watched football for years but if we keep our heads up and find a too keep going I think one day will see lots off improvements at least we're going on the right direction though
We're not very good 😂😂😂😂 no chance that we won euros next year
How is Southgate still in charge when Arsene Wenger is available? He has decades of experience in England, has a record amount of FA Cup wins, a lot of experience in the Champions League, he would have respect of the players, he would pick players on form and he would try to play exciting football.
SOUTHGATE IS DESTROYING THIS ENGLAND  TEAM
What a bunch of Cheats North Macedonia are their fans should be embarrassed appealing for everything.
southgate is class
Once again HM plays another blinding game for England 😂😂...konsa on the bench no surprise there
Slabhead is gonna cost England from winning the cup.....
People moaning about the ref but not about how England shouldn’t need refs decisions they are playing Macedonia, should be about 8 - 0
Football refs are worse that the FIA
Another boring match.  Slow slow slow Play like u play in the prem
If England had the Scotland manager they would win the world Cup 😂
Controversial Draw?
They always do us talk about  bogey team
Dion Dublin should stick to selling houses if he doesn't think that's a penalty by Maguire. What chance do refs have when so-called experts can't call it right? Both penalties IMO , your winning fvck all with Maguire in your team.
South east Europe? 😂.
Haha England are awful 😂
Watching paint dry is more interesting.
{ MCFC } First thing first Congratulations to Rico Lewis for being the great player he is for Club & County 👏
Lol I hope you lot are enjoying watching this shite under Southgate been saying for years I won't support while he is here 😂 Can't even beat a bunch of peasants
Anyone who cant understand how shit Maguire is but still plays every game need to look at southgates career and how shit he was ,hes obviously Gareths love child to Ellen Degeneres
Grealish has got to be one of the most overated so called superstars ever,what does he actually do?
Saka has been absolutely terrible recently!
I am english but for those people with insomnia watch england your problem will be solved.l am sick to death of this constant shite backpassing with McGuire philips stones  shaw the main culprits ,todays football is shite.
💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤
I said years ago that under Southgate there will be positives and that he deserves respect and credit, but that he won't get the most out of the talent we have and that we will always fall short, and I still think that. Not just saying that coz we drew against Macedonia. You can see it in almost every game how they're too rigid and don't play with enough freedom/ instinct/ flow and that telepathic understanding the best teams who win cups have. It's partly an England problem that's been there for a long time to do with our culture and mentality, but I think that's hopefully changing now finally, but frustratingly it's like we're slowly decreasing that natural talent as we always do by forcing them to play too safe and rigid. We need the right coach who is capable of creating a solid stable team whilst simultaneously maximising the charisma and natural ability on the pitch, because then we have an excellent chance of winning trophies. No point playing too safe and always falling short and missing another opportunity for success with players who are capable of getting it.
Turgid 5 at the back system with a below-average center back who seems to believe he's prime Pirlo
Embarrassing. Again. Let’s have some attacking football
You guys I was watching the highlights on my TV. I couldn't see the comments (or too complicated to get on comments). Literally got on my phone just for the Maguire comments. Lemme have it
It wasn’t a penalty because Maguire was one of the attackers. If the attacker does a foul is not a penalty. Maguire is considered one of Macedonia’s attackers in those situations.
Maguire is useless, but the media will still keep up with the "he never lets England down BS"
The commentators are bias asf
Southgate last few days been putting on a weird squad and it paid off..Terrible games...nobody know how 2 play wiv each other..
So pushing a player over and not getting any of the ball isn't a penalty but heading the ball to clear it is. I also love how Maguire instantly waved his finger as well, to say that a stonewall penalty isn't a penalty
Rico Lewis looked out of his depth
The performance from england wasn't great but OMG the referee was absolutely shocking. He was constantly giving Macedonia soft free kicks for almost nothing at all really but the penalty decision was just ridiculous. Why is VAR even looking at that? Yes the arm was flailing but from what I could see there was hardly any contact with the player, probably a bit of contact from Lewis's hand but hardly enough to warrant a penalty. What on earth did the ref see on the monitor to make that decision to give it? I really feel for the lad because he's gone out there on his debut and had that shocking decision given against him. I just hope it doesn't knock his confidence. If anything the Harry Maguire challenge before that was more of a penalty than the one given against Lewis. Standard of refereeing is getting so so poor.
How is Maguire in the team before Konza or Branthwaite
Why is the quality absolutely terrible when watching channel 4 online?
ahaha harry maguire 😂 he just keeps on giving. his terrible pass intercepted, then falls over himself and clearly fouls the attacker haha.  how is he in this squad?
East European CHEATING ref. SACK HIM
Only one problem with England and thats Southgate.  We have no chance in the Euros if he stays. Graham Potter til the end of the Euros would be my choice.
Never seen a more blatant penalty than Maguire belly flopping into the attacker. Was that Dion Dublin saying it's not a penalty because he took him out with his upper body!? 🤣
Maguire isn't the problem. Southgate is the problem. He picks him.
Its time for a change of co commentator, Dublin is why past his sell by date. and going by the display from England, they need to buck up for the competition proper. not impressed one bit by tonight's  performance.
Ref and VAR had a shocker tonight.... Gave a pen against Rico Lewis but didn't against Maguire.... They got the pens wrong way round  We've won the group and qualified but there has to be major improvements or Euro 2024 England could take an early exit
Played like a mediocre team!!!! Against north Macedonia who we beat 7 - 0 last time!  Ref was making some money from this game blantantly! Wanted a draw! Decisions were shocking! But exactly as he wanted but as lots have said,,they should of played better and beat them.
Watch the way the ref high fives the masadoznia captain at the end? like they are mates 🤔
?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Dogs°°t again. Southgate better order the plane to be on standby in Germany because England will only be staying in Deutschland for less than a month.
I think France or Belgium will win Euro 2024 😂
lol this is hilarious. The mighty england always putting down other teams and they cant even beat n macedonia. hilarious
5:00 a predetermined ad break for football highlights is crazy  😂😢
Dion Dublin really really!? Talk about biased commentating this is the problem England dont perform and the commentators retoric tries to cover up poor performances 🙄 "Harry Maguires studes catch on the pitch" what! he totals the player "no penalty"  its getting worse every game.
North Macedonia's best player was the disgusting biased referee. Apart from his lousy decisions against England, he got in the way of shots on goal twice in 30 seconds.
In case anyone needs to know Southgate ain’t winning fuck all. Championship manager at best.
Yeah, Madrid ANDJude Bellingham were really gonna waste his time in this meaningless match! He has a "Shoulder" injury u know!😂😂😂
Such a talented squad being led by Southgate is a crime 💯 He isn’t a winner and has zero ball knowledge or passion
The first one isn't a pen but the second one is????
Maguire falling into Phil Jones category
Shit again,  bad ref decisions agreed but..win Euros? No chance. Maguire shit..again
Fml...the only argument Southgate gate to keep Slabhead in the team was that hes played well for 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 despite being a disaster at ManU. But even though it was an isolated incident today, we can't have players at this level having these kinds of brain-fart moments.
I'm all for being for your country in commentary, but Dublin takes it to extremes. Any time i've heard him, you'd think England players never commit a foul, you'd think they're fouled all the time. He's ridiculous. The Maguire 'challenge' which wasn't given as a pen was verging on assault, but because he didn't touch the boys legs, it wasn't a foul?? So according to Dublin, you can nut opposing players all you want and get away with it because it wasn't his lower body you 'tackled'. The Miovski penalty was correct also. The defender clearly smacked him in the face and took him out, but it was just a flailing arm, nothing in it... Absolutely insane way to view a game. Both were clear penalties.
Harry the hatchet man pretending to be a football player.
Thumbs up everyone who misses quality, exciting club football and just puts up with these tedious slices of dreary international boredom. Soooo terrible!
A rugby tackle & a clothesline.. Both stonewall pen's.
Can't believe pundit so biased says Maguire not a penalty it was more like a rugby tackle
Calm down everyone one won the group ages ago....
When is the Euro 2024 draw?
Rashford   kane. Saka   Bellingham rice trent   Lewis  stones konsa james
Trent in midfield?
i aint worried about the fouls! how are we drawing against macedonia so shit
Even me being from north Macedonia 🇲🇰 can tell this referee was under the influence like chris brown when he stepped onto the pitch
Maybe my ball knowledge is lacking over all these constant rule changes but please FOR THE LOVE OF GOD can someone explain why the referee didn't rule Maguire's foul a penalty?  I bet Rico's was only rewarded because the ref new he messed up the first time 😂
dion dublin is more biased than the israeli army spokesperson
Thanks Harry "donkey" maguire
Phillips out maguire out= trent in england euro champions
Pls dont say maguire is solid for england. He makes so much mistakes. How is it penalty against rico lewis but not harry maguire? And the commentator don't think it is penalty for maguire pushing is insane
Maguire out.
Refereeing across the game is absolutely shambolic right now. VAR isn't the problem, it's the decisions made with and without its help.
really would have liked Tomori to get some minutes seeing as this game didn't matter
Lol an own goal is what gave england a draw? Pathetic.
harry Maguire out here just doing harry Maguire things lol
commentator is glazing big time LOL
These last 2 game would of been a great chance to put jwp along side rice to see what they can do and form a partnership not a fan of trent in cm i think hes played there 3 times for england twice vs malta and tonight and it just doesnt work hes a great player but hes a full back southgate please leave harry maguire out of this team your constantly playing him even though we had qualified you had plenty of options to have a look at just tells me its stones and maguire starting in the summer regardless of form or ability along with your other favourites who get picked each squad
If England dont win something with this team Is all on Southgate and his stupid team selections, How Is Harry Maguire even still playing for England he's dog.
This is the most talent we’ve had in the squad in literal decades, and we’re stuck with a manager than can’t tell a tactic from a tictac.
Eh NM are a banana skin team. A draw is fine
Get rid of your co-commentator. His bias is ridiculous. I'm not expecting any English commentator to be totally impartial, but this guy is embarrassing.
Trent way better than phllips
Harry Maguire is proof how terrible England has become as a country.
Southgate has to. His boring style is good enough to through qualifications but isn't good enough at the major tournaments
We need to bring harry maguire bullying back because he is going to cost us big time
England have to take magiure out!!!!!!!! Time n time again the weaklink in the team. U can see he has no confidence anymore and it will destroy the players reputation and the teams.
Is it just me or is Sterling everything England is missing right now? We've seen what he can do against arguably one of the best right backs in the world, imagine what he would do to this Macedonian right back. Grealish struggled to even dribble past him today lmao. Have no idea why he is not even being considered compared to the likes of grealish and rashford
I feel sorry for English fans.. how many “golden generations” will the FA allow coaches to f up with great talent.  Such a great pool of talent. Some get selected some not.. at-least 4  selections in the squad are mind boggling. Your coach never picks on form. But still the fans think football is “coming home”  🙄 Talent is not Englands problem. Team selection and this Southgate fella inability to use the quality he has are killing England..  they will be going home early in Germany I’m calling it now, unless things change drastically
why does harry maguire love to be the star of the show every match 😂😂
We really missed Bellingham today!
The first penalty check  was a 100 percent penalty, so when the second one shouldn't have been a penalty so it was Justice for North Macedonia.
Ridiculous penalty
England are mundane, everywhere they go…..everywhere they goooooo…..
Couple lazy performances with some experiments thrown in. Pretty confident they’ll be a bit more up for it come tournament time.
If Maguire's isn't a penalty they'll all be pretending to trip & knocking people to the ground. He's a total clown. 🤣
Guarantee we win nothing with this manager
How on earth is that a pen? Football has officially gone mad
And they want the number 1 spot hahahaha
The way Harry Maguire waved his finger at the referee "no foul" after body slamming his opponent to the floor was comedy gold 😂
Guehi played really well tonight
Southgate is not the man lets be real … look at how good our group of players are this generation and the English FA have wasted it for all of us by putting a manager in place who wouldn’t get a premier league job possibly not even a championship job .
At least we didn’t have to play the whole of Macedonia - could of got ugly
Honestly I do really love Channel 4! Who's with me! For real love them! I love footy and England but I properly really love Channel 4
Engine won’t get anywhere with Maguire
They're shite England. Southgate is shite, some of them players should not be in the team. Glad I stopped following international football after that 2014 world cup.
Why Maguire is a pro soccer player?
What a boring football team england are.
Bias on the commentary is a joke. No wonder no one takes England serious
The referee was absolutely awful tonight- and most of those terrible decisions went in OUR favour!    The Maguire one was clearly a penalty- he mis-timed it and barged him over after giving away the ball himself! The Lewis one was obviously NOT a penalty. They took about 6/7 minutes to rule out an incredibly obvious offside. And there were just so many poor/ bizaare smaller decisions as well.     Terrible performance but the ref was just shocking.    It's irritating that Grealish has reverted back to that player who gets the ball, stands up the full back and then just passes back again. He stopped doing this after his first season with City but he's gone back to it. Watkins is completely ineffective if you don't have a high line to play it behind for him. Guehi is not international level yet. Trent is NOT a midfielder. Oh, and Southgate still makes subs far too late!
That was a waste of 90mins+ of my life gone
So you're allowed to push somebody, so long as you trip yourself over first 😂
Let’s all be real penalty or not 1-1 against north Macedonia like I said last time. This team can’t bring home a trophy & I’m a England fan. With the amount of talent we have on the pitch to come away with a draw is embarrassing. Not good enough
Total shite..maguire is a menace .. bad reffing
England are so poor and got a rubbish manager
Dodgy ref
Classic harry maguire 😂😂
HOW can the commentator say the Maguire tackle wasn’t a penalty without cracking up?! 😂 This English bias is awful
People laugh when i say i love womens football and have done for a while both club teams and the Lionesses, the state of football in the mens game with all the problems like shambolic officiating proves people shouldnt laugh. Ive been a fan of the beautiful game since i was a kid but its no longer a beautiful game
Unbelievable how that foul wasn't penalty 😂😂
Gents. We can’t be drawing 1-1 against North Macedonia with the caliber of player that we have. It’s not acceptable.
Maguire again showing why he is a liability… He gives the ball away.. falls over his own studs and brings down their attacker.. he got lucky the Pen wasn’t given… The ref probably gave the Rico Lewis pen as he knew he f**ked up
Where is this north Macedonia in this world... America or in Australia?? 😅😅😂😂
About as authentic as Eurovision Song Contest
Gareth should bring back his lucky waistcoat we will need it in the next tournament.
Embarassing need to sack Southgate now or no chance yet again in a major tournament.
I wonder what the wage difference is like between both teams
Pickford got unlucky good save
Not impressed. Can do better please try harder.
We drew to a bunch of farmers
Southgate is destroying any chance we have of winning these competitions by staying as manager
Penalty all they long , you cannot jump to a ball in the area with your arms spread wide and pretend your a helicopter. Clearly lewis needs more experience he just can't do that
Harry Maguire always seem to make several mistakes a game - passing directly to an opposition striker or midfielder when he is the last man, or just manhandling attackers and fellow defenders when he gets out of position.
England were plain and simply crap, doesn't matter how bad the ref was.
That was defonatly a pen from maguire as an englishman im embarrased.
Absolutely shocking from Maguire yet again
How on earth was that a penalty??
England are a joke drawing with north Greece, ALSO Harry Maguire is a pest for club and country BUT always gets a pass and protected because "hez one of da ladz" if this was Ashley Cole people would be calling for the electric chair(!) ,slab is  complete liability and shouldn't be anywhere near the national side or man utd..
Just wait for a proper team to get Maguire by the throat 💀 England are screwed with him 🤣
Anddddd everyone is defending Maguire! Can’t you guys see? He past it now! Will be the one who fail England in euros next year!
Maguire is a total liability . More crap from ENGLAND .
Speaking as a Welshman... blah ha ha ha !!!
Ref should be banned for that game
We deserved to loose tonight these guys earn to much don't care simple as that shit team if its not our first 11 even there not the greatest yet long way to go
Think maybe I'll stop watching our England men 's team , admittedly I never expect much these days but even so they are so boring to watch. Too bloody slow , Maguire doe's my head in , has to take two to three touches before passing to someone who was available for an immediate pass let alone his giving the ball away ( others were well guilty of that as well ). We are sloppy , too slow and make bad decisions which isn't good  for the supposed talent we have. Ok ,  Macedonia packed their defence out ( and played well , credit to them ) but if our players are of the quality peeps think they are should be able to combat that. Yes the refereeing was bad again , almost as bad as the Chelsea women's game the other night but given the ranking we are supposed to have we should not be suffering a draw in this game. Yes we topped the group but watching this teams sub standard play doe's not give me much hope or enthusiasm.
you would think that the amount of commercial money channel 4 makes that they would not monetise youtube for those of us who cannot afford high paying subscription fees. Just saying!
Maguire rugby tackling someone isn’t a pen but the lewis one is anyway the ref was a discrase
Bleet bleet
England are Shiite! And the media say England have the best team in the world Lool  probably 8th best team in the world, never going to win the World Cup! But will get to 1/4 finals
How is Maguire still getting picked hes atrocious
Painful game and a waste of my Tuesday evening.  So many players not knowing what to do with the ball, no penetration of the Macedonia defence, and no real tactics.   No more talk of winning any championships chaps, not until this team becomes deadly to play against.
Apart from all the advertising before and during the "GAME", what are we being shown here?.... think about it!
Farmers
How is that a penalty? Great save Pickford though. Great equaliser. So I counted 2 v 0 England. Back to back qualifying campaigns unbeaten
Stop moaning get behind the team win or Lose
1:37 why it's not coming home
CORRUPTED VAR AND REFER
Southgate Out!
Maguire is pure shite
And there was me thinking England we're going to go all the way in this tournament.  When will I ever learn?
Count this as a loss
I'm use to seeing this kind of refereeing watching utd every week. Happy to laugh at every one else cry about the referee for once
definitely not a penalty that
England from the kick off didn’t have any go in them ,I vote this match the most boring of all  that I have watched. Shameful effort,can’t see us going far in the euros from that display.
Are we sure that was England playing? They look like an average Sunday league team.  Southgate has got to go.  It’s no wonder the pubs and clubs are not full when England play these days, when you would have to force them to watch that crap.
I can't beleive we didn't beat Macedonia I mean ffs cmon. Im not going support england in this Summers euro. Absolutely disgraceful. How can we do the double over Italy but not beat a bunch of part timers even though we qualified with 2 games spare. Yep England are absolutely poo. Southgate out Sven Goran-Erikson in!
Dion Dublin is such a terrible commentator.
The Ref drunk?
Hopefully, Gareth knows what he's doing ? Rashford n maguire  😊😊😊😊😊😊
The commentator said that's not a penalty wtf 😂😂😅
Trent John Alexander-Arnold is not a midfielder and it showed, awful constant giveaways of the ball 🤦‍♂🤦‍♂
Favorites....
Bbc news: this is one of the greatest team with great players. Over hyping over paid players, without winning anything since 1966. 😂😂😂😂 it's not coming home.
If we want to win we need to beat every team. France wouldn’t lose to north mac. We literally have no hope lol
I have never heard such biased pundits. Dublin was an outrage
SOUTHGATE OUT
You gotta give it to the referee, he was involved in everything. Highlights don't do him justice
Not being funny but how are we evening meaning about the pen, we drew 1-1 with North Macedonia ffs..
Southgate said "we'll play to Watkins style" so how come he never got a direct pass in all the time he was on???
Maguire is a fkn joke
Yeah Maguire's wasn't even a foul. We've seen Virgil do it countless times, he's just trying to force him off the ball
South Gate out
Why is this 8 minutes. 30 seconds max and be done.
Yet again the main talking point is about the officials. The person who influenced the game the most was the referee. Embarrassing.
Ref was having a nightmare this game
Southgate needs to go, I just don't get how we have this talent and it looks like this.
Why do all damn highlights have the result in the title! Let us watch the highlights to learn the scoreline!!!
Harry Maguire is... Consistent.
Dion Dublin needs to stick to Homes Under The Hammer
Southgate out!!!
Controversial? For whom ? Harry MAGOO doing his usual rugby tackles and the screams for Kane “ doing what he does” OG ? Dion Dublin commentary cloud cuckoo bull . Love you brits the way you make this team sound like world beaters until you actually play WORLD BEATERS .
Feeling like Maguire is NOT the one 🙄
13 leg parlay ruined
Shit
Went straight back to pass pass pass go back not looking forward. Southgate needs to let his players express and loose!!! We’ve never been that team… we’re so better trying to score more than we let in. Fact!
England LOL
Stonewall penalty from maguire so the ref compensates for rico Lewis tackle
Football ain’t the same no more man
Gareth choosing Maguire is a fucking comedy in itself
Another rigged referee
Another Southgate shocker…he needs to be replaced and quickly. How on earth can we draw with North Macedonia….the whole team, including back room staff need a reality check. England are just plain boring with no flair and no idea under Southgate. For the good of the game…GO
what a shitty comentador dindt had one right
How is Maguire still in this team? I reckon he has pictures, dirty pics of Southgate and Stormy Daniels
How the commentary can say no pen i can't belive it.
Harry Maguire 😖
I wonder how much the ref was paid and who paid him 😮
Southgate makes me not want to watch us anymore. I turned off at half time against Malta, and skipped this match. Harry Maguire and Jordan “the hypocrite” Henderson? He makes me sick!
Sack Southgate, can't even beat North Macedonia, no way can he win us a euros
Sorry but that was bullshit 😮 WHY DOES HE CONTINUE TO PLAY MAGUIRE INSTEAD OF STONES AND WHY PLAY TAA IN MIDFIELD HE IS A RB THATS COMING FROM A LIVERPOOL FAN HE DOESNT BELONG IN MIDFIELD A LINE UP LIKE THAT WILL HAVE DEVASTATING EFFECTS IN THE FINALS USE UR HEAD SOUTHGATE !!!!
That maguire foul is ridiculous, you’re not allowed to do that in rugby 😂 Rico Lewis one was definitely to make up for it
no disrespect to Macedonia, they played well, but England should of won this game. we are not winning any cups. France, Portugal better sides.
Stonewall penalty for lewis. Should have been aware of his surroundings like they said for rashford vs Copenhagen hahaha cope
It's embarrassing that we can draw with a caliber of team like this yet France can play Gibralatar and get a 14-0!?   The standard is so poor and it shows
Maguire is a far better defender than Southgate will ever be as manager. Therein lies the problem.
Maguire's is a penalty, yet more Sunday league quality from him and Lewis NOT a penalty.
Southgate must be made to play maguire
Last tournament before Gareth gets the sack.
An absolute embarrassment of a game from both England and the ref.   Englands last two games have been a national embarrassment to say the least. How we can even think of considering ourselves as favourites to win the Euros is an absolute joke. Clearly we don’t have that 100% mindset a team needs if they want to win anything.  These last two games was just pure Southgate ball. Absolute shite football for 90 mins. Tactics were non-existent and player selection was just beyond ridiculous.   How Southgate is allowed to even try to justify Maguire as a pick for England is a joke. What has he actually proven??? That he’s a knob head that doesn’t belong anywhere near the squad. Constant mistakes and poor play is gonna cost us in the long run.   Plus in the previous game the midfield selection was just absolutely horrendous. How Henderson and Gallagher even touch this squad is mind-boggling. Idk Southgate brain operates as it’s completely beyond me. Time after time, he’s making poor decisions in every single match and yet he’s still getting away with it. When is the FA gonna realise that he’s screwing England more than helping.  Also I like Watkins but the chances he’s missing from the games were disappointing to say the least. The chances fed to him are chances he can’t be wasting like this. Honestly it would have been better to play Kane first and then sub him off later for Watkins after we have already established a dominant lead.   Now onto the ref… How can you as a ref make so many wrong decisions in a game??? Whether the decision was for or against the amount of mistakes made today must bring further questioning on the match officials. How these decisions are allowed to happen is an absolute mockery of the sport, killing of the game. They clearly gave the pen on Lewis to make up for the fuck up they did on the pen that Maguire committed. But these types of mistakes should not be happening. It’s why VAR was created to begin with, yet these dumb errors are still occurring.   This is wake up call for us and we need to start acting on it now if we want to even think of touching the Euro title next summer. #SouthgateOut
Pedestrian , boring , repetitive, unimaginative, just what I expected from a southgate shackled side - fodden did try his socks off ,  he kept making so many runs without being found from blinkered team mates
I feel so bad for Rico Lewis. Young quality player, makes a good challenge/clearance and then a shockingly bad decision has probably knocked his confidence out the window.
same old garbage England.  They are so boring to watch.
Bigger question is whether TAA passes the audition in two games at No 10?
Engdogs
Foden    Kane   Saka                Jude             Rice   Trent Walker stones tomori   james  A fully fit james has to start at rb we saw what he did vs city. Walker to lb cause the rest of the lbs are crap. I feel like this would be the strongest possible team.
Maguire is such a LIABILTY OMFG. Southgate tosh.
Maguire is so shit
What a dry game, England can't even beat this team. Maguire is no good and Southgate shouldn't manage anymore. It's gonna be costly
southgate wouldnt make it in league 1, shit manager
Shoddy refereeing once again but that seems to be expected nowadays... and I still don't know how Maguire is starting over Tomori or even Konsa. Both brilliant defenders and both deserve a chance equally considering we had other fairly new starters in the squad like Rico Lewis and Guehi in the backline, Watkins up front and Palmer coming off the bench! I really do not know what Southgate is thinking at the minute... happy to see that we've qualified but I sort of dred to think what will happen at the Euros if Maguire is still our #1 CB 😤
Should of been 2 penalties to Macedonia, all the money in England’s side and to draw tonight is down rite embarrassing
Are the French paying the refs again?
Southgate needs to go
SouthGate out!!!!!!
I agree maguire is a donkey but if its not him who you starting instead in june?
Better check with the bookies after this one.
Maguire with the loose pass, chasing across then literally collapsing on the red player. Classic. 😅
What does Maguire need to do to be dropped? Genuine question. I actually feel sorry for him, he shouldn't be selected and thrown out to the lions (ironically).
Joke penalty as usual.
Shocking performance, from management to players. We should, by now, have the best number 10 in world football, but he sticks him out as a left winger, because that's what Pep does. Saka is a one trick pony, show him down the outside, and it's a backwards pass to walker, Watkins can't head a ball, Rashford shouldn't be anywhere near any squad on this seasons performances, including Sunday league, Foden is no more a number 10 than Slabhead, And Trent is one of the best full backs in the world, so Southgate tries to turn him into Xavi, because Jürgen has tried it, yer, he's prone to the odd lapse defensively, but ..... I give you.... Slabhead. We're a shambles from top to bottom.
Dion Dublin saying that wasn't a penalty lol
How much money did maguire pay the ref to get away with that one?
people complaining about the pen like maguire didnt rugby tackle someone in the pen area, england should beat macedonia even if they get 3 pens
Harry MagEeyore strikes again
Rashford was wank again
Last 2 games were poor but you can tell theres a lack of effort due to being through already.
Southgate is a clown
Lucky England ano own goal….uhmmm…dobbin Maguire does it again….and what the hell is Philips doing in the England squad let along on the pitch. Wokegate needs to get shot of Maguire, Henderson and defo Philips 😮
This myth about Maguire never letting England down does my head in🤬
England supporter here and that maguire foul was definitely a pen, way more than the Lewis one.  I get the feeling the ref feels guilty about not giving the first one
Maguire’s intercepted pass followed by the body flop has got to be one of his funniest yet (the finger wag as well after)💀
Maguire has cost us tournaments tge myth of he never lets England down is ridiculous
Maguire, mate. you have Walker right next to you, Pickford behind you. Stop passing it through the middle when there is literally not a single option. its basics.
get maguire on the bench bro,  bring in tomori
Enough of boring international football roll on Saturday when normal service is resumed
Both woeful game and referee(VAR etc), the C4 commentator also appeared to have lost interest in the game after five minutes.!
that co-commentator "i think the contact is with the upper body not the lower body, i don't think that's a penalty" lol wut?
Never the one to comment but I got to question the referee decision here.
Not normally one to call out refs but this one... worst ref I've ever seen
Best team in the world (on paper) and performing like this. Something needs to change and that starts at the top
Harry (clumsy)Maguire it was a clear penalty..they were robbed..
FREE STERLING
how is it controversial? Maguire caused a penalty and ref didnt give it?
What match is Dion Dublin watching??
Harry Maguire unnecessarily gives the ball away and then makes a reckless tackle inside the box which should have been a penalty yet Gareth muggy Southgate insists on picking him. How do you justify it?
Contriversial. We we're shit mate.
I really can’t believe Maguire is in the National Team Squad. He is a premiership level player. What he has done to the attacker after the wrong pass was definitely a penalty.
It doesn't matter if England Qualify, they won't win it as per normal.
we are shocking, i dont even like watching this team anymore
and thats why we had a international break for this crap, little Macedonia giving us a lesson, robbing the public of watching their local sides, scrap the international breaks waste of time.
Nice to see Phillips get his normal 6 mins 😂
Worst thing about moving to channel 4 is dion Dublin on commentary. Christ he’s unbearable
That Maguire one was a clear penalty he’s a shocking footballer
"kane has scored, now he is just waiting to get on the pitch"
who was the co commentator? he was horribly biased throughout the game, was a bit embarrassing from Maguire's foul (not a penalty?) onwards
England is a super team with a normal man who call his self manager, i feel sorry for This team bcz they not gone a win nothing with this shit manager. They need to replace him other way they will be fucked 🤮🤮🤮
Maguire clumsy challenge, wipes out player - no pen.  Lewis accidental hand brushes face - pen. Modern football for you.
We are fucking shit
Yet again, another ref protecting England's opponents. The games where England run the game is when they have a fair, unbiased ref.
England are the new Scotland. 😀
It wasn't just one or two incidents like people are making out. I watched the whole game. There were countless bad decisions from the ref.
Mate the football is so shit can’t wait for prem
Thank god the prem is back and we can forget about internationals until March.
Has VAR actually made refs worse? Or has it just exposed how bad they always were? Either way, it's not working very well, is it?
Southgate gotta go. England look mediocre with him
lol the commentator saying none of the challenges were penalties had me crying LOOOL whats he smoking
The ref did his job as well as our players did theirs.  Its abysmal. How many 50/50 calls went against england. The first pen was a pen not given and the second wasnt a pen but was.  We have all that attacking power and did NOTHING with it. And dont even get me started on slabhead Maguire again... How many times did he give the ball away?  Abysmal play by england and disgusting officiating.
Pickford worse goal keeper in England
VAR realised they'd dropped one with Slabhead, so tried to rectify their mistake with the second. Which wasn't a penalty in a million years. But that's the hideous despised VAR for you. Joke system run by clowns who know nothing about the game and are hellbent on ruining it. Sorry, HAVE ruined it.
Why I never watch England games explained in 90+ minutes! 😵‍💫😵
Southgate out
Not a chance of winning anything  . Southgate
Jarrod branthwaite playing every week for us & is a class above the bang average Maguire, not even in the squad, Gareth has his favourites which is fair enough if you've managed to win a tournement, with the aformentioned. He should have gone after the last world cup failure. This squad of players really should be winning a major, Southgate just hasn't got the bottle to go & win one.
Embarrassing that their number 9 went down and stayed down for that long, but it's nothing on how embarrassing the decision to award a penalty is! Mental.
Dreadful, two games in a row. With all the talent at his disposal, it’s amazing to see how bad England play under Southgate!!! Imagine what Pep would do with this talent…..we might actually win something!
I've been getting really cheesed off with refs in the Prem getting too close to the action around the edge of the box... this ref tonight was on another level in terns of getting in the fekkin way... and he was generally pony too of course.
Not a great performance but finished undefeated and top of the group and people still crying in their cornflakes. 😂😢😅
Controversial draw? Maybe pen was soft but it was SAVED - Pickford should have done better
That ref though 😂😂😂😂 He’ll get sacked but I have a feeling he won’t care. He made a killing at Ladbrokes.  Thanks to Harry Maguire for giving it away at least 5 times and getting away with a stonewall penalty
PENALTY!  What, no penalty! WTF? Maguire is a muppet.
England are so shit !! Tranmere Rovers would beat them 14-0
The job was done, we had qualified and the game didn’t mean much. BUT with the quality the side has, why would you want to risk casting any doubt whatsoever against Macedonia.   Why are we making excuses regardless of the stage/importance of the game. France demolished Gibraltar and we should be happy with a draw ‘because we’d already qualified’? That’s not the mentality we should be displaying in the last game before a major tournament.   Also, you cannot blame Southgate all the time. The players need to take some responsibility with the ability they have. People have also been crying out to see certain plays in certain positions eg. Trent in midfield, Foden in midfield and Southgate has opened up to this and I don’t think Trent has done enough to justify that start. He will be giving that no10 shirt back to Bellingham who it rightfully belongs to.   IMO facts are as follows:  -A team without Kane is worrying. -Bellingham will bring that winning edge and he must remain fit if we want to win in Germany.  - Maguire IS a liability, he’s done enough to prove that. - Southgate’s game management is still in question as displayed today.   -
If England scores 4 or more. People wouldn't complain about the penalties.
Now can we finally admit that England does NOT have , "a World Class Squad of Players" and that Southgate is simply a PC FA mouthpiece with average managerial skills.
Pickford was unlucky yeah the guy sticks it in the other corner wtf
how has southgate not got sacked yet
Bit shit but nobody's gonna care about tonight once we're in the knock out phase next June.
Freakish and Sakah were ineffective for far to much of the game. England movement and passing was too slow against a team they should have beaten.
You would think he’s a premier league ref with that horrible refing performance.
I think it should have been two penalties for North Macedonia.
Eagerly anticipated draw?? You're havin' a larf ain't ya! England will NEVER win anything with Mouthgate in charge. The last two games in particular should tell you that. Boring, boring negativity.
England put in a top class performance against one of the giants of European football. 🤦‍♂
Southgate said we have the making of a top international team, well after the two last game/results I think he should remove those rose tinted glasses, England are far from a top international team they look weak at the back mainly because of MaGuire the carthorse and continually are far to slow at going forward, I personally don't think anyone in the team know what a through ball is to a player running forward to split a defence, they just lack imagination. R.
They cancelled the Prem for these two games. Just think about that for a few seconds...
Tell Haaland come England & drop Kane into the 10
Think Maguire was playing American football with that tackling technique in the box 😅
So ,who's fault was it this time,asking for a friend??!!
Southgate out!!!
He slapped his face loool people are irrationally biased
Joke
Macedonia players soon realised that all they had to do was fall to the ground and the ref would give a free kick. Suspicious!! Went to see Dumbarton v Elgin City in Scottish League Two on Saturday and the ref there was miles better than tonight’s ref who UEFA believe is somehow good enough to referee at international level. Laughable. That ref has to be on the take because it’s not possible for any ref at any level to be that bad. That aside, England certainly weren’t good enough tonight either even though they were hindered by the ref. Macedonias man of the match: The Referee
.... more referees required like this ....
England are always fortunate that there is someone to blame,this time its the ref.never themselves.😱😱😡
Did dion Dublin actually say neither of those were penalties?
Southgate needs to go and take Maguire with him.
Gareth Southgate: England's aim is ranked NO1 in the world. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Football won't be coming home
What a mess with that reef tonight what the hell is he watching  England players fouled so many times but when North m went down its penalty it clearly wasn't 3 minutes to look at vr does it really take that long thank god for Harry Kane or we would have been in trouble tonight
....don't worry...England have 5 more gears to go through...😂😂
D.Dublin seems like he hasn't played or seen football before. saying both are not Pens the Maguire one is 100% a pen the Lewis one is a tricky one to say.
One sided commentary, how do you still keep Maguire, he will cost you the cup!
HOW IS THIS A CONTROVERTIAL PENALTY?? It should've been 2 penalties.
This is a certified referee masterclass 🤦‍♂
wasn't it McGuires "pass" that led two him making that "tackle" in the box that "wasn't" a penalty? At this point we have to honestly ask whether McGuire is the subject of some sort of curse or voodoo
Blame the ref all you want but england played poor
Definitely penalty, slab head kind of cranked up like the oil ran out , no one can do the crank like him
...refreshing to hear some impartial England commentary for once...😊😊😊
Harry Maguire is so bad why does he keep making the team never mind start 11!
Harry Kane sh**t so as England
The standard of refereeing is awful. Maguire looked more of a penalty than the one on Lewis!?
Another paper plane day for England. Boring.Gifted own goals today and at the weekend. A team full of superstars,  on mega salaries who struggle to beat a team of part-timers, that's why you will never win a major tournament. It's just not good enough. Despite your your wealth of so-called quality players, they simply aren't delivering for England. Harry forcing an  own goal!  Very impressive!
Southgate surely by now can see maguire will cost him dearly
Who is this biased commentator? England lucky to have only conceded 1 penalty, that was crystal clear foul from maguire on elmas! I feel they got robbed. Embarrassing performance once again, #SouthGateout!!!
Harry Maguire is an absolute calamity. If he goes to the Euros he will 100% cost us a game or two. Hes slap stick comedy
No one really staking a claim for a place.
considering maguire passed the ball to macedonia then proceeded to tackle the attacker to the ground when he was through on goal and that wasnt a penalty, no one can complain about the pen given for the slap across the face.
I hope this doesn’t happen in euro 2024 with time wasting by VAR
Joke .this is poor compared to  france
Grealish is not offside he is in line with the player wth 🤦‍♂️
Playing like this England will suffer a lot of humiliation next year when it will go in Germany..Shame on you for the last 2 results..Southgate it must go and manage another team..is an awful manager which it will never win a trophy..please sack him as soon as possible..
Another impressive performance from Maguire and Southgates merry men.
VAR is just a joke like the ref checked 3 minutes to see if Declan rices goal was offside it should be 1 minute done ✅ it just time wasting and that penalty shouldn’t been given no contact just a tape on the head like bruh all sports pundits will say that’s not a penalty and  I totally agree with them
No room for Sterling nah?  What a joke!
Pleased we got through . But what a crap match,  with a bigger crap match official.
Fans complaining Kane's dive V Malta was a penalty 😂🤦 and now a clean clear elbow to a Macedonian player and they think that's not a penalty 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 the delusion.
Never mind the football.how bad was the ref and var it’s killing the game . People in Outer Mongolia could see jack was offside but var that long
Not good enough.
I’m sorry VAR is trash not even challenging for the ball no way a pen
The refs in the last 2 games have been more useless than a chocolate fireman.
legit the most boring team in the world. somebody please get rid of southgate🙏 we had six defensive minded outfield players on the pitch when we was 1 0 down against a team we recently beat 7 0 🤷‍♂️ throw some attackers on ffs. he's a clown
Time Southgate got rid of Maguire, they're better centre half's out there, he's slow not, quick in transition, hits more short passes than anyone else and so clumsy in tackles it's ridicules 😡🤬🤬🤬🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Southgates fault. Maguire, Pickford, an Henderson are still starting and Phillops is still in the team. Thansk Gareth
Jesus Christ people saying how bad the ref was, England were playing north Macedonia 😂😂 doesn’t matter what decisions are or aren’t given, they should be winning comfortably regardless
Everyone’s complaining about rico lewis pen (agree never a pen) but conveniently forgetting Maguire foul. Most stone wall penalty I’ve seen 😭
The commentary was soo biased
The standard of refereeing has gone so far down hill it's unbelievable. That was never a Macedonia penalty. Officials trying to make a name for themselves thinking they're as big as the players
We’ve already qualified and that’s all that matters, we don’t need to take these last games that seriously 👍
How is that not a penalti on Harry Maguire? He takes everything apart from the ball....😮
Even worse performance than when they went against Malta. they actually gave away a penalty even though it shouldn’t have been given.
Maguire got away with giving ball away twice v malta, tonight he does the same then proper gets away with one, if thats us, we'd be screaming pen tbf. They didnt show the camera from behind the goal, he bundles him over, doesnt matter about upper body or lower body Dion
Disgraceful
A bit concerning how poor we look without Bellingham, we can’t be relying entirely on a 20 year old, but then again Southgate has always relied on individual brilliance
England are actually finished once Harry Kane hangs up his boots . England are blessed with defenders and midfielders but the future ain’t bright with Olli Watkins and Nketiah
Rico Lewis and Phil Foden ran the show tonight
Such an embarrassing display by the ref 😅
Honestly that VAR drama and giving rico Lewis a yellow card is harsh and that penalty was not deserved he didn’t even made contact he just tapped him on the head 😂and when Englands goal was ruled out for offside it took like 3 minutes it shouldn’t take that long to check something from VAR I don’t like it why do we have it if it’s just pointless time wasting
Who played worse? A. Trent B. Maguire  C. Rashford D. The Ref                       Answer: all of the above.
North Macedonia v England (1-1) | England End Campaign With Controversial Draw | Match Highlights  2206pm  20.11.23  you got to see a  load of edited shyte we got to see the game... will be the playground chant etc etc... on a fan level, it was shyte. the team are getting shitter. not better. the ref was pants. i think his half brother played in goal and his step brother was in the crowd singing to the Macedonian anthem. absolutely terrible reffing and terrible VAR decision making....... just like premiership, really...
Embarrassing to only come away with a draw even if we wasn't trying. With them amount of talent we have on the pitch, this should have been a walk in the park.
sui
I'm sure that ref had a red shirt on under his black top tonight.
Well that was fun.  Better bed time material than my usual rain sounds i suppose
We've already qaulifed and won the biggest games of our group in march I don't get why people still are slandering Southgate
