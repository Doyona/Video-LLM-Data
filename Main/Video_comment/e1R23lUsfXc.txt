FIVE-star Arsenal! ⭐️🔴 | Arsenal 5-0 Wolverhampton Wanderers | Premier League Highlights
My favourite Football Game ever
😔😔😔😔😔😔 xhaka left us
Well done xhaka👍😎😇
Thank you, Granit ❤️
Here after Xhaka transfer confirmation yesterday 😔. He'll be miss.
LEVERKUSUSEN
It's 20 May 2048 and for the 25th season in succession Everton have just narrowly avoided relegation having spent the entire season in the relegation zone. Unlike the other 19 Premier League teams who had long since switched to a fully AI management system, Everton stuck by manager Frank Lampard Jr Jr until his position became untenable when their win percentage dropped below the now customary 21% benchmark. Given the lack of human managers in the game who haven't already been sacked by them, Everton turned to Minty from EastEnders to shout at the players, tell them to get stuck in and get their 'ed on it which ultimately led them to safety. They travelled to Arsenal for their also customary final day 5-0 drubbing which ended as tradition dictates with Everton fans shirtless and dancing in the streets at their club's heroic achievement.
❤ 2:00
Arsenal are the best
Erm who said he's going
Why they play with new kit already?
Typical when the pressure is off
Xhaka is my fav player I hope he doesnt leave
Whenever there’s nothing on the line arsenal is a different monster
Its really  hard to admit but we  bottled it, call it progress call it what you like but we folded
‘Wolves were unlucky tbf would’ve been a draw if it weren’t for them 5 goals’ 😂😂😂
This is why villa is the best team in the west midlands 😂
Xhaka thank you but in reality for us to take the next step and win the league we need better in a few positions and he’s one of them  Rice is the missing piece on that centre
You fcked it up gunners are dog sht
How can they even celebrate goals are bottling the league?
Bottles ... mcfc
too little too late mate, bottlers
With xhaka definitely leaving, I hope to god arsenal sign Declan Rice.
saka's gonna be dangerous next season
Bottle jobs
We will miss his goals next season...
Siuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu LOL
as a honest chelsea fan xhaka is better than lampard
Arsenal with absolutely nothing on the line
Xhaka the only player to play a consistent game this season. From start to the end. Everyone else dropped their guard and they got fisted. I will not forget this season. And I honestly don’t believe this Arsenal will have a better chance at the Premier League for years now.
Arsenal coming back strong after being hammered into the ground like a tent peg by city 😂
Jose Sa ha ha ha .....
Bravo Granit, you're always going to be remembered, true Arsenal Legend.
No good playing like that when you bottled the title that you should've waltzed.
Bottle
I love new kit
Get in
2 months to late 😂
Bottle job FC
no pressure and back on to winning, classic arsenal
Shocking from us, need a major squad fix up if we are gonna challenge for Europe next year 🐺
If only they played like this against Liverpool and the few other games after that. But if is not enough.
We won’t forget this team!!
Bout time 🙄
a bit late for that result surely now
Nice keeper flap at the end there, some good goals tho.
Everything seems easy when you have nothing to play for
Little mentioned fact:   Arteta equals Arsene Wenger’s record for the most Premier League wins in a single season.   26 wins.
Anyone else notice the way Jesus assists Xhaka for his goal is the same exact way jesus scored his? Weird
Arsenal have a serious mentality problem
Thank you, Granit. So good to see him smiling.   Once a Gooner... ❤️🤍
That kit though 😍
To late for all of this
What a boring commentator
Predicted we would score 5. Don't understand why we are like this at the end of each season
How embarrassing lol wearing gold on your shirt with no trophys 😂😂😂😂😂 london bottle jobs
Arsenal are great when it means nothing.
What a trophy for arsenal
Is it just me, or has sake improved his dribbling is more dangerous, and has that fler u get me 0:37 1:14  🥶
Ramsdale cost them the league. A half decent keeper they'd have won it. Please don't let him near an England jersey.
Too late for Arsenal now
We didn’t win the league, this year will definitely be bittersweet. But the improvement in this team in the last 12 months has been crazy. People saying arsenal won’t be anywhere near the top next season are crazy, we have played the best football this season and I know we will get even better! COME ON YOU ARSENAL!
Have to respect Granit for the man he is!   Respect and thank you 👍
Imagine if we won those games now with city droppings points on there last two games
its crazy 5-0 and it doesnt matter jokeclub
Hes not gone yet. Should keep him. He's our warrior
Kiwior the Best!
Thank god that rapists goal got ruled out
Cant believe City lost 1-0 to a midtable team bro xd
Remember when Xhaka flipped off his own fans 😂
Man said woeful wolves like it’s horrible histories or sumin
GJ9 should be a winger & we look for a striker in the window
Great season for us finishing 2nd, being in a title race way earlier than ever expected for Arteta but hey we tried. I had us finishing 5th at the start just missing on top 4 with mid 70 points, for Arteta to get us to mid-80 points is great. His original contract was up to here and when he signed I think most Arsenal fans would have said get a trophy and return to the top 4 then go from there since we were in an absolute mess when he took over for the rest of 2020. The club and squad have been revitalised, just a few more tweaks and buff up the squad and it looks good. Good to see Xhaka leave on good terms but we need to move on him and really refresh that whole CM area. Hopefully new signings dont take 4+ years to become a valued member of the team like it took him.  If the season had been normal then the first 19 games being against different opponents as you'd expect then Arsenal would have had 44 points, City would have had 45 just that the postponements etc changed the outlook. So second 19 games Arsenal got 40, City got 44, just shows we aren't able to stay with them as the squad differences are so clear. The term bottled is overused and really should only be used when someone is in a position of a clear advantage such that its seemingly impossible to lose from there. Arsenal were never so far clear of City. At best it was the point when they had an 8 point lead in April but City had a game in hand and still to host us (I remember neutral fans saying this makes it basically a 2 point race), City are just relentless.   BTW fair play to Wolves, had them going down at the start of the season and tbh Im not sure how theyve stayed up with just barely 30 goals reached.
Little too late, partey was already over
Good to see Kvyur open his account
When’s the Bottle-Job Cup v Spurs?
Somewhere in north London there's a very lucky She-Goat bracing herself tonight.
have it
Why are they wearing next seasons kit already?
Is it actually confirmed xhaka is going. I know there's been a lot of talk but nothing concrete?
🍼 🍼 🍼
Thanks for the 1 decent season out of 7 Xhaka❤️
Why let a player go when he’s at his peak !
Easy to play like this when there's no pressure already, this players are washed
WHAT WE SHOULD DO ALL THE TIME ENY WAY
Wolves played like Chelsea
COME ON ARESNAL WIN IT ALL
Bottled job 😂😂😂😂
Biggest bottle jobs in premier league history
Typical , no pressure then same decent football comes out.
5 - 0 Everton last season even this season
Any ideas why some wolves fans were celebrating our goals
Nobody remembers 2nd place ….. ever…….
😂😂😂😂 imagine celebrating after losing the only title your probably ever gonna get close too  again ..
Definitely Xhaka's best season at the club, just a pity we weren't lifting the league title for the perfect send off
Still bottled it
I cant be the only person who thinks this arsenal kit looks like a arsenal kit from 2016
Saka looked sharp and was crisp today! Someone must have done juju on him during the run-in because he was back to himself today. Xhaka farewell my soldier! You've been on smoke this season my G, good luck with Leverkusen and Xabi Alonso
A fairytale ending for Xhaka to round off a varying Arsenal career. From becoming a liability due to his hotheaded nature and frequent dismissals and giving fans the middle finger after being booed leaving the pitch to becoming a key part of a successful campaign for the club and irreplaceable in the team, a brace in a dominant departure is the perfect way to exit and will be missed
Nice....but too late.... Still, if you  think of last season when our aspiration was to finish in the top four.....and we are disappointed we didn't win the league.......shows how our expectations have risen....back to where a club of Arsenal's stature should be  ....thanks Mikel....you are manager of the season
Think xhaka was a fan villain but like he was Loki in avengers the villain but a bit of love think if he’s done arsenal will miss him in midfield
Arsenal should of kept this energy for the title
Well done granite. Shame arsenal bottled the title.
Fabio Viera is Xhaka successor. Arsenal will get Rice or Caciedo (can’t see them getting both). Arsenal will try and get a Right back (Fresneda/Cancelo. They will also get a winger who can play as a forward (Diaby). ESR will be a back up to Ordegaard, Holding & Tierney will leave.
Why are they so celebrating like they havent bottled it so hard
A win that means nothing
New kit is dope and a great callback to the invincibles, it's our time next season! What a season!
And when there is no pressure on us we thump lower table opponents unlike when we need to win we lose to Nottingham forest, draw against Southampton twice & draw games against Liverpool, Brentford & westham 🤦🏻‍♂️
Now they try after losing the league what a flop
idc what happened in the past. its the mental fortitude and ability to overcome it and becoming a better version than that u were of yesterday. that constant battle. you granit are a warrior. the good the bad the ugly. u stayed true to yourself and we lack that in todays society. wish u had stayed. best of luck my guy. hope to see u again sometime. In shaa Allah. (God willingly)
Saka turning up when his team don’t need him too, starboy 🥶
Could not have asked for a better fixture, wolves on the beach, should have been a cricket score, next year will be more of a challenge.
I remember Xhaka's first match and goal against Hull City
If the win came earlier they would have title hopes
Nice one guys u bottle it then perform when it doesn't matter👏👏👏
I am so thankful for Granit Xhakas’ service to our club. There may have been many rough patches along the way, but what a way to end his arsenal spell; been pivotal this season, and I wish him the best of luck with the rest of his career. COYG❤️❤️❤️❤️
This match just proves that Arsenal crumble when there is pressure. They just can’t play under pressure. When the pressure is off, they are back to their best. Playing beautiful football again. I guess that’s because they’re still a “young” team.
Its amazing how much better Arsenal were when the pressure was off
Thank you Granit Xhaka..We'll ❤ forever 😊😊
Why do people think xhaka leaving he's probably staying
Trossard is a welcome selection problem for Arteta
Jesus is not bad out on the right
Champions! 23!
Kit looks like the puma one when sanchez and ozil cooked... gonna be the same again next season 🔥
Where is the point Arsenal. You lost to Everton Drew the Hammers..... Lost the league.
If xhaka is and r leaving this club we all do miss you all ready
If you’ve decided it’s your time then all the best Granit you leave our club with honour and dignity. Your dedication, emotion and determination will always be remembered and I’m sure along with me the rest of our fans will respect you for the rest of our time, some player and what a guy, take care of yourself 🫡
I was there at the game yesterday and what a way to end the season shame we did not win the prem but there you go ❤😂🎉😢😮😅
Arsenal are celebrating their GOALS like the TITLE lose 😂
Xhaka had one of the best comebacks I ever remember after what happened with the fans.
I think it sad to see Granit leaving when he FINALLY become the player Wenger saw...
💀 whoever arsenal play on the last day just know their getting pumped
Calling arsenal struggle for top four next season
Disappointed we couldn't win league. However if u told me at the start of season or after Newcastle game last season we'd finish 2nd and get ucl football? I would've bit ur hand for it.  Better luck next season COYG!
🇦🇱Xhaka🇦🇱
how is that not a foul on the goalkeeper jose sa?
Forgot wolves even existed, they’ve been a ghost team this year
Theo Baker was right. On his podcast he predicted a 5-0 victory for Arsenal, but asked in advance: why couldn't you have done it sooner?
Xhaka man🎉 despite all the hate we gave him he still came through for us⭐️👏🏾📈
It was bit too late in this season to see this momentum, but thanks Xhaka
Thank you for this season Arsenal❤
Kudos to Xhaka. All the best for his future.👌
Need to keep this momentum going, sign some quality additions and press on for next year 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
Xhaka isn’t going anywhere 😂😂😂
🍼🍼🍼🍼🍼🍼🍼🍼🍼🍼🤢
Biggest bottlers
Xhaka wasn't class in his style of play but done ok this season, one thing he is good at is kicking people up the backside so for that is a salute not much else.
The streets won't forget granit xhaka once a gonner always a gooner 🔴⚪️
😂😂😂😂😂 arsenal still trying to win the league , but late 😂😂😂
Thank you Xhaka for all the hard work you did at Arsenal, it wasn't easy but you got there. Well done sir ❤
BOTTLE😂 of the history of football
No pressure fc back again🙄🙄🙄
Wolverhampton Wonderes need to be relegated they are such a poor team
Why we wearing the 23/24 kit?
Frère Xhaka Frère Xhaka Dormez vous? Dormez vous? Sonnez les matines Sonnez les matines Ding ding dong Ding ding dong
the quality of football is teriible these days
Great performance but pointless playing like that now after a flurry of results that cost them the title
No pressure....  Course your goner turn up !!!
I swear they scored 6 or is it just me Dhaka scored to 2 sake scored 1 partey scored 1 Jesus header and at the end kiwior scored that’s 6 the comontaters wronnnnnnngg 🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨😡😡😡😡😡
still bottled the title tho lol
You can tell how much he loves this club, sad to see him go
We brought Trossard in to help us win the league & he scored 1 goal in 1/2 a season. A lot of Arsenal fans are delusional if you think this guy is the future of the club & can compete with the world's best. Needs to be sold in the summer. Bring in Neymar
Yess
Not ready for him to go 😢
arsenal celebrating winning 5 nil against wolves like they still have a chance at winning the league lmao
Yeah, it's all a waste really. It's evident these Arsenal players couldn't handle the winning pressure when it mattered.
Thanks granit you definitely turned your arsenal career around good luck for the future too
Bye bye, Xhaka; 1 decent season doesn't eclipse 6 years of mediocrity abd more red and yellow cards than assists. As for the game itself, it was a nothing game; what is there to celebrate?
Show up when the pressures off
Arsenal used their new kit for next season which is quite weird
Amazing what Arsenal can do when there is no pressure on them. Embarrassing.
Thank you granit❤
Xhaka is only 30 years old, why selling him ? so silly move
That's whats so annoying and; every1 entering the hypnotic Twighlight Zone domain in claiming Richy were preema Messi-time Barcelona an tearing up the league when in reality we've ended the season losing ONLY 1 game more than them. Those 10 vital pts we daftedly squandered gainst lowly Ham ,reli-favourite candidates Forest an 'Hampton plus Brighton (who havent really won a game since), really hurt cos we wudda gone into this final game 3pts up on Richy who lost so the TV wudda been rs anyway.
Now u want to win 5-0 🤣🤣🤣
Nice touch with the gold to celebrate the 30 draws they got in one season 😂
Bit late to wake up. 🤣🤣🤣🤦‍♂️
On a good day it’s hard to take ur eyes away from the quality Saka can produce. Easily the best winger in the prem this season
Although arsenal bottled the league u can’t ignore how good of a season it’s been for them
If there is one thing I have taken great joy in this season, it's Saka. I'm not an Arsenal fan but I would say he was worth the season ticket by himself.
Issa bittersweet send off for Xhaka. He put in a serious shift, and we still could do with him when we need the squad depth doing the most. Hopefully we don't crumble again next season.
ASSNA AND DORTMUD ABSOLUTELY BOTTLED THE LEAUGE
Look at that.  No pressure and we are playing some outstanding football.  Really annoying because we have the talent to win the league!  Thanks xhaka and good luck 👏
I wonder if Xhaka will score goals instead of getting red cards 😂
That new kit is shocking, our last one was so good
Those gold stripes sure look stupid now that they've blown the league.
Sa is sooooo bad hope he leaves
Arsenal kit looks amazing 👍❤️
I’m liking the new Arsenal Kit.
Of course Arsenal play like this with no pressure 😄🙄
Arteta's biggest mistake this season was benching Trossard to fit Jesus back in.
Arsenal will start again next season on top of the league 😊. Great performance
I thought after the first 3 goals saying the goal scorers names a song was going to be invented 😂
I think everyone has scored this season Apart from the keeper
Xhaka is an absolute Arsenal icon and legend. One of the best midfieldes they have had since Fabregas and G.Silva left.   The ones who dont rate him are the ones who were saying Guendouzi would be a world beater and is a much better player than Xhaka 😂 But Arteta was right to sell Matteo Guendiva. Arsenal will be less effective without Xhaka. There is a reason Mourinho has wanted him for years.  On a side note, Jose Sa is rubbish.
We collapsed due to pressure of being top of the league no doubt just look at the damage that can be done when we enjoy our games with no pressure. We need experienced players who can help us stay top of the league especially during the tail end of the season
The new kit gave them super powers
No Pressure FC. Only serious when there is nothing astake.
Lush goals
I saw all the players after the match
Who cares. Too little. Too late.
Xhaka should of stayed his on form. Don't know who will replace him. Could be a flop like pepe.
Just knew we’d end the season battering Wolves, Sod’s Law that once we’ve got no pressure on us, we perform well. So proud of the team this season though, disappointed we faltered towards the end but can’t fault that we took City almost to the wire 👏🏼👏🏼
Arteta out ! Edu out! Half this squad out! This is all pointless now
Season over Saka scores , partey scores , Jesus scores. Where were their goals in games that mattered / counted in the past 2 months ?
Still bottled the league!
Next team to be relegated next season 🐺😂
Still bottled the title though 😂😂😂😂😂
Was at the game today, incredible atmosphere and incredible send off to the players for the year! Especially Xhaka. What a story ❤️🔴
Thanks you xhaka for everting you have done good luck for your future lots of love the gunners ❤❤
Sadly for Arsenal, Man City were playing like this when going for the title.  Arteta needs to not only sign some players in the summer but sign players who can lead the team while keeping a cool head. Declan Rice would be a great start.
Lol always perform when no pressure
imagine if xhaka scored that hat trick, that would have been a perfect send off
The new Arsenal kit looks sick!
How can these guys celebrate all of their goals after having such a nightmare end to their season.
All the best to granit xhaka! Thank you, especially for this memorable season you gave us 🙏
Utd have had a better season 😂❤
Lols still Man City won the league 😂😂😂😂
No pressure fc bottlers
Babe wake up its 6 Wolves: They've scored again?!?!
Xhaka is going to be missed. Great bloke.
I still cannt believe xhaka is leaving 😢 farewell
Sakas goal was beautiful
That is the second goal this season, where if Ben White doesn't pointlessly foul the keeper the ball would go in anyway
Why do I feel that if the fate of the league title depended on this match, Arsenal would have bottled it
It feels Xhake epitomises what us fans has gone through. Ups and downs but we stuck by the club
Thank you Xhaka! Goodbye 😢
Could've done putting in that type of performance against Southampton, Brighton, Forest but no arsenal being arsenal thought they'd save it for when there's no pressure involved 😂
Crazy if Arsenal beat Brighton and forest they would have won the league despite the 3 draws and man city defeat that didn't actually matter but Brighton and forest were the two they had to win.
Arsenal + No Pressure = Prime Brazil  Arsenal + Pressure = Spurs
Very good season for Arsenal xhaka
Bottle job FC winning when it doesnt matter 😂 cant handle the pressure
Xhaka, when the wolves fell
Great send off for Granit and the new kit is 🔥
the legend xhaka we wish you well
Love you Granit ❤🤍always a tooner
“England players are overrated” 1:28 ye sure
Mate I always like xhaxa and I was backing him when he had his moment with the club
How can you celebrate when you just dropped the league. How can you celebrate a goal after the the flop of history
Can't you tell arsenal bottle the league because as soon as the pressure off they have a 5 goal thriller 😂😂😂😂😂 I like it I like it I like it ooh CITY WIN 3 IN A ROW
arsenal turned up when it mattered the least, good job
Defiantly have a strong foundation to push on next season, the club has its mojo back.
Xhaka boom.  What a character, what a story and way to end his arsenal career on a high.
Thank you Granit. Welcome Declan 🔴⚪️
Gutted that we saved this performance for when nothing matters what a team tho I can’t wait for next season
Typical Arsenal, scoring goals for fun when there's nothing to play for. We need some major reinforcements with experience for next year if we're to make any decent showing in the Champs league.
Xhaka's redemption arc is finally accomplished. Best of luck Granit.
Xhaka,s my favourite player grate season love you xhaka
That kit looks marvellous 💫
Deep how if we won against brighton and forest we wouldve won the league. (Idc that city played their b team)
LMAAAAAOOOOOOO if only Arsenal could've shown this amount of class earlier then they might have retained that 12-point lead
Thank you granit been ups n downs your a true gooner thank you ❤
Wolves supporter here. You would think we would play decent against a good team like Arsenal on the last match of the season, but that the fact that Wolves played terribly is inexcusable. Specially when we've sent our goodbyes to Costa and Neves. To me it's just disgusting that they couldn't be bothered to innovate on the pitch together, meanwhile Southampton despite being relegated, played very well drawing with Liverpool with 4-4. I hope they can do better in the next season despite this.
Bottled the league 😂😂😂
Saka only plays well when the pressure is off..been one of arsenal worst performers past 3 months but will get a pass from idiots fan
Not many players would’ve stuck around after that infamous incident and redeemed themselves to become a fan favourite! Thank you GX
Thank you granit ❤️
If time could be reversed…. This should be the Gooners’ performance for the last 3 weeks… Thank you Xhaka!
Arsenal ........Uloma
Awesome football! Love you Granit- and THANK YOU!
Disappointed but still a great season. Thank you for everything xhaka 🥰 best luck at your next club 😇
Meaningless game we bottled the league No pressure FC
It's always on the last day
I’m really going to miss Xhaka. He has done a lot for the team, and has stayed with us during our highs and lows. I wish the best of luck to him in his future
The Trossard->Jesus goal was on the class of Ozil->Ronaldo
Splendid.
The invisible man Saka finally turned up
Anyone else find it hilarious that Arsenal's new kit has gold stripes on the arms and legs because they were that sure they were gonna be champions? 😂
Bottle jobs. Too late now.😂😂
Is it my imagination or does Collins look like he'd put a cheeky tenner on an Arsenal win at 0:12  🤣
He will be remembered with love from all arsenal fans ❤️
I swear there was 6 goals
Shocking.  Wolves among the favourites to go we all know where next season. 😣
Worrying times for Wolves.
Solid performance 🔥
What was the point lol.
cant wait to see the boys in the champions league again
When the pressure is off, they look like a good team
Omg that Saka goal 🥶
From saka missing a crucial penalty in the euros to scoring more than 13 goals thats an amazing recovery
saka is unbvelievable
saka looks like hes back to usual form
Nice to end the season with a decent win. Yes boys!
Amazing send off for Xhaka. Thing we finally got to see what he really was about and thank Arteta for that.   Whole season is a huge positive for us from where we had come from. Finally champions league and also the atmosphere is great atm. Let's keep this going!!
Credit to xhaka man to take the hate and improve as a player to what he is now is extraordinary, will be sorrowly missed 😢
tottenham and arsenal will always be similar where they usually only play good when there is nothing to fight for. Arsenal are a more prestigious bottler fc than tottenham
Typical Arsenal, only turn up when there's nothing to play for anymore
COYG ❤
Always loved Xhaka. Even back when everyone didnt. Will be missed
BOTTLED IT
The new kit is 🔥🔥
Win at Everton and beat Southampton and we would’ve won the league 😂
Eventually Saka was found in North London after going missing for 6 weeks 😂😂
So many positives this season for Arsenal. Edged out by an incredible City side but theyve got a very good squad. Few decent additions theyll be fine next season
Do you think they designed the new kit with gold trim to celebrate the title?
If only var had been fair. Two apologies from the p#£ks
Fair play to Wolves it can't have been easy to find 11 lookalikes in less than a week to cover for the fact the squad was already on their summer holidays.
Fir xhaka to be announced this early means we have signed someone as arteta would never let him go without a replacement
Xhaka
xhaxka we will miss you!!
Yeah leave it to the final match when the league is lost to start scoring
The perfect send off 🏅
Wolves on the beach
Did the players forget that they have buckled worse that a french soldier? Smiling and hugging each other after each goal. Shamless bottlers with zero clue about how to behave. Need a Roy Keane in their midst.
Crowd was incredible today.
Disappointed as I am for Wolves’ performance, at least they got themselves out of the bottom before the World Cup started. That’s good enough for me. 👏
Gonna miss you Granit ❤️
Where was this performance in the last 3 weeks?
Xhaka thank you for many great memories!! Proud of my club
What a way to bow out Granit. We will miss you amazing redemption arc.
Still bottled it😂
Well done lads! Heart for xhaka everyone!❤❤ in the comments section
Arsenal still smiling
when theres no pressure its beautiful to watch assnal.
I wish this could've been before city lifted the trophy
When the pressure is off arsenal win
Damn that kit rlly changed them from 1-0 to forest to 5-0 gunners!
Amazing from the boys today but where was that in the last 8 games, its a bit of a sour end to the season
What a season ❤❤❤  What a club   Thank you Xhaka ❤❤❤❤
Pleased for Arsenal, just shows they can perform when the pressure's off, but Wolves were terrible, never showed up.
It’s annoying why xhaka leaving he is having the best season he has had with us
We are going to miss Xhaka soo much. What a season and comeback he has had. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Its only Wolves, Arsenal just a bunch of bottle jobs at the end of the day and won absolutely sweet FA 😂😂😂
Thank you xhaka❤
Too little, too late.
Saka, looking good bro 👌🏾✅🫡
The problem with xhaka at arsenal is people never loved him no matter what. But he kept being professional and playing is games. Today he showed arsenal fan that he is a football farewell to xhaka and good luck for your next club
Adidas really do bless us with the best kits 😭🔥 we need to go all the way next season! COYG
Sad to see Xhaka go, but this ruthlessness of letting a player go, even after their best season, is exactly what Arsenal need to do if they're to go to the next level. Now let's get the correct business done this summer transfer window, and go again.
So pleased I was at his last game. Never had a bad word about him even when all the negative stuff happened
No more red cards in upcoming seasons !!!!! 😅 we going forward 🙏 😊
Way to go Arsenal 👏 turn up and dominate when it doesn’t matter 🤷🏻‍♂️. I mean obviously I’m happy that we won the game but it’s too late for that performance 🤷🏻‍♂️. No excuse next season. If Arsenal don’t win Silverware next season then serious questions need to be asked! I’m expecting Arsenal to win the Premier League next season at least!
No pressure f.c, most bent club around
Farewell to our Swiss, leader,vice captain, true gunner God luke grannit
only good without pressure
Arsenal are seriously going to miss Xhaka, not for his on pitch presence but for what he brings to the team in the dressing room.
That new Arsenal home kit is a beauty to be fair
Typical Arsenal, where was this thrashing when they were fighting for the title ? 😂😂😂
still no prem title lol
IDK WHy you guys happy u bottled the league aHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAH
This is how we need to play in the champion league
what a goal for the aka’s
So happy for kiwior, that goal gonna boost his confidence. He’s been great last few games
Sad to see xhaka go but happy we got the win for him ❤
Kiwior ❤ Poland!!!
We're going down next season  wolves
The gold kit is embarrassing anniversary or not after bottling the league
I for one am gutted if he goes!! Gives everything everytime he plays!! What a big miss he'll be!
What a finish by Xhaka great goal for him. Keep up with the boys.
Xhaka’s farewell goals for arsenal
This is arsenals last game of the season and we couldn't watch it on bt or sky or Amazon or anything which is a joke in my eyes and I'm not just talking about arsenals game I'm saying we should of been able to watch all of the last games of the season, dont know about what anyone else thinks, am I the only one ?
TO LITTLE TO LATE F---- THIS TEAM THEY DROPPED 9 CRUCIAL POINTS THAT COULD HAVE WON US THE LEAGUE IT WAS IN OUR HANDS F-- THEM SURPRISED FANS TURNED UP
ARSENAL player exceptionally well and thank you Xhaka we will miss you
Nice to end the season with a win, them 4 games ( 3 draws and city loss ) killed the title hope's but to come 2nd and get champions league football again is a massive improvement and arsenal need to build, well done gunners
Is xhaka defo going?
Xhaka...The end of a Wenger era?
Hope the €28,000 ticket was worth it for this
Let's all feel for Stake who paid out on Arsenal winning the league 😂
Xhaka was the only men left from Wenger squad. 7 years at Emirates we will miss you Granit.
Who is going to be the best promoted team next season
that odegaard flick for the second goal 😫
First thing Saka has done for months now lol.
Perfect sendoff for granit from the man who we booed to the man we sing for granit xhaka we've got , granit xhaka we've got good luck at levukusen
Arsenal would have won the league if they didn't lose to forest and brighton😂
2:12 damn! Ben White been watching Brentford? 😂
dear commentator please learn to pronounce Kiwior properly. Not Kiwor but Kiwior
Bottled it
Saka man what a PLAYER. 21 years old ends the season with 14 goals and 11 assists beating Mane and Sane best ever seasons. Truly a gem/Wonderkid/starboy. Xhaka what a rollocoaster if this is the end you gave it your all this season ❤️🙏
I don't want Xhaka to go :(
As an Arsenal fan I'm sad but proud at the same time. Roll on next season!
When we cannot win the league now and we are under pressure we all of a sudden become prime barca great...hopefully we do even better next season with the ucl back with the young player potential we have and it was an amazing game for xhaka a good bye bye.
Amazing season - I'd trade the good feelings we had for any trophy! Hopefully more to great feelings to come.
Our first goal was a second ball from a corner and so was our last goal of the season
Shame arsenal couldn’t do this when it mattered
Wow! They're such a good club when there's no pressure.
🎶Granit Xhaka we've got, Granit Xhaka we've got! 🎶
Small club 😂😂😂
Good to see Xhaka getting a move to a bigger club thus summer
Xhaka the Goat
Shame they bottled it last week
Fare well Granit 🇨🇭
Forget the haters... Brilliant season. Champions League and some good transfers to come? Well done guy's.💚👍
The only season he didn’t score a screamer, he reached double digits in all competitions 😂
Granit Xhaka would walk into any Liverpool team ever
Xhaka will be missed the passion and desire is going to be a massive miss!
Tottenham💀💀💀
The complete 180. If he does leave, he’ll definitely go down as a club icon
When the pressure is off
Well deserved 2nd spot
Thank you, Granit Xhaka ❤❤❤
Arsenal when there’s nothing to play for😈
Its great to see xhaka play well on his final day.
The fact that city lost to Brentford meant that arsenal would have won the league had we beat Brighton and forest
HA   -  HA    -    HA    -  HA.   -  HE   -   HE.  -    HE     VILIGE TEAM ...........!!!!!!!!!!
Classic Arsenal, only performing when there’s no pressure
Granit xhaka we want you to stay 😞
Good bye xhaka...what a servant!
Xhaka has improved so much 🔥
Despite Xhaka's rough history with the club, I thank him for his service.
Next season Arteta should tell players not to use any socials so they dont feel pressure🤣
Ofc they win when there is no pressure. Bottlers
Nice
Where was this when u guys were playing Liverpool, West ham and Southampton 😂. Bottlerrs
Bottle job FC turning up when it doesn’t matter.

Arsenal blowing teams away on  the last day of the season when there is nothing to play for and they bottled their objective just like last year 😂
