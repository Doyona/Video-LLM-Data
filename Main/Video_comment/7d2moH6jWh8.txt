Ferrari snitched him out to the IRS
He was gentle this round lol
this dudes living the life
Mee
I’m watching the video like: why he doing dat🥺
So you did that instead of giving it to me💔
Can't believe this bs got you your first felonies lmao
You good sir, are an idiot. A smart capitalist, but an idiot nonetheless. When our country moves on past YouTube idiots, we’ll all be in a better place.
0:04 farreri😂
bro got the spending habits of a 5yr old
Smash it baby
I’m laughing so hard but it’s so sad I’ll never have this much money in my life time
3:59 he didn’t get sued   He got arrested 😂 this doesn’t age well
Its actually 500k...💀
11:53
13:50 how to basic vibes
How does he own that massive property and all those cars? And a workshop for cars?
you deserved to go to jail for what you did to that Ferrari
When I hear Ferrari I think about double DNF’s
here for the taxes
How many ladders does this man have? 🤣🤣🤣
me while he is driving through the tall grass
all jokes a side hes a good driver ngl
He said there would be a lawsuit over this ferrari.
Ferrari watching this 👁️👄👁️
No car is worth 400k they have lost therr FK minds especially one made of plastic or carbon fiber whatever that POS is made of 😂
is fake the video bro
"hey heres a first car cody-"  him: "ASHES."
Meeeeee
Who saw the 67
it's so funny.
This didn't age well
I guess that he is piss off got arrest after that Ferrari car got wreck it.. yeah
Guess it's true they just decided to go after ya for tax evasion instead sorry that happened to ya hope it all works out
Buying a ferrari is like buying a house in an HOA
Cody this is your future self , don’t do it!! The great state of Tennessee is going to put you in jail!! For false tax evasion!!
What about utensil the Lamborghini for the mad
“The car was never in Tennessee” 😂😂😂 half this video is IN Tennessee
I don’t think he realised that once he crashes and hurts himself he doesn’t just respawn
Bro not knowing bros gonna be arrested in the future for this
Whos here after he got out
he forshadowded it at the start lol
the subtle foreshadowing
5:37 That has to be the biggest dent I’ve ever see on a car lol
This video is so ironic being that the police actually did come arrest you over this car. Lmaoooo
if anything, hearing that exhaust makes me want a Ferrari
Do NOT forget to pay the sales tax bro 🤫
i knew i recognized that dbag keller from somewhere when i was watching dde. lol, someone please cut his hair.
I’m gonna watch this on repeat just for Tennessee.
Why does bro have so much beef with red cars especially that square body
Who came here after seeing his vid about getting arrested
This Ferrari stunt's paid for by the idiots who click like. Brilliant!

That drift in the thunderstorm is actually epic and maybe even legit ferrari advertising.
Just give e the car 😭
Thats what happens when you don't buy american. Ferrari caca!!!😊
Я не понимаю налоговую систему. За что он не заплатил? Если дело в НДС, то он должен был заплатить при покупке. Если налогина имущество, то имущества то у него уже нет.

This is great 🤣

13:15, would love to see "behind the scene" footage of this clip
MAGNUM! Your Ferrari privileges have been REVOKED!
It's quite possible that Ferrari is a package of turd communists. If that's true, and these Ferrari chiefs are the ones who turned in this WD character, Wisteria Diemsel ( jailhouse name) is gonna be teasing house thieves and murderers off Alligator Ally
I need emergency room treatment; my heart can't bear to see everything that's happening. 😔💔
Some one dream car ❤..
WD can confirm bright red Ferraris do in fact come with lawsuits.
I think I have a feeling that I know what he drew in the horsey. I don’t know if I should do this, but I’m gonna.🍆
Taxes
Came after seeing him being arrested
This guy is a BRAIN-DEAD IDIOT!!!
That didn't look like a "Destroyed" Ferrari to me..   Did I miss something..?
Well Cody said they don’t like it when people do this so he wonders what they would do to him he’s finding out what they do he’s sitting in jail now on 10 percent of 2million based on ai but that not for sure good luck
The stupidity of the human race never ceases to amaze. And yes just read about this !!D!0T Cody Detwiler getting arrested.
The ferrari legiel team did really come.
This aged like a fine mtn dew.
WAA WAA HE BURNED OUR FERRARI😂

All you had to do was pay taxes on it bro lol
Uncle Sam here. You owe us money 😂
This is the best Ferrari video❤

Starting with just 55k two months ago and reaching 290k today feels incredible. Katherine Ronald, your guidance and insights have been instrumental in this journey, and I’m deeply thankful for your support and knowledge.”

Wish to own one of these one day
How do you get that money
Keller was right and your wrong stupid
Damn bro, your dad‘s gonna be pissed
The cover lamborghini the car ferrari fuck ferrari
ferarri f8 looks like A F***ING C8🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😭🤬🤬🤬
What a boring way to end it🫤
But why though? Like I could have used that money to pay for my mom's surgery that she cant get because we cant afford it. Why do you do that and no just do some good with that money? This is just nauseating
I like your video whindisel
i feel quilty watching this
Why was it wrapped in a Lambo wrap?
5:44  -30k
This video = when you have more money than sense, class, intellect, entertainment ability. Any fool could just fuck up expensive cars. Why don't you man up and actually try to race them on a track. Having destroyed cars and raced, I can tell you you'd have way more fun competitive racing. But you don't have that much sense. Such idiocy and destruction for likes. Smh
Bugatti 10M
That car looks soo gorgeous mannnn 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢....

Ferrari destroy😊
It would be a nice change for your future to put all that money you have to waste to do something life changing with it. Look around at all the things going on the face of earth where money determines living or dying. All that money you're wasting could change another's life
Hey instead of breaking a car send me a car! My dream car Laferrari around 5 million US Dollars. But ofcourse i would be happy with a ferrari around 400 000 Dollar. Thank you!
im going to get one of those car bubbles like it my car gets dusty because of this bullshit earth thing ai is going to fix that soon
How did he get a drivers license?
Ferrari still couldn't outrun the cameraman
i would be somewhat upset if he did this to an f40, testarossa or a 250 gto but tbh i dislike modern ferrari; the company and their car design like EVERY SINGLE ONE looks the same now, i feel like the 430 was the last good looking car
Hindi Dubbed 🤮🤬🤡
This is Gen Z idiocy at its best. Think of the people he could have fed with that money.
JUST WHY? WHY YOU CAN NOT SEND THAT 400,000 DOLLARS TO GAZA OR AFRICA
13:19 RANDOM BULLSHIT GO!!!
What to see if his guy with a surron or E-bike wander what he can do 😂

here’s the thing: after two whole years of making this video, I’ve got a wild idea brewing. Picture this: a furious honey trapped with a Russian sex doll. It’s gonna be epic! And guess what? The main plot of your channel will take a backseat. You’ll be begging for sponsors’ money, begging, begging!
Ferrari didn’t know that they made a rally car. 😂😂😂 ps u forgot the crowbar
You are a fuckin big dick🖕🏻
The ferrari front looks like a Lambo
Just watching this back and noticed that in the video the license plate is sometimes on the car and sometimes not.

This is the very first video I watched in a Whistlin Diesel Channel, caught my attention and made me subscribe & very unique and ofcourse aswell it’s often entertaining
Bro, there’s no way Cody just jumping in the car Ferrari that cost a 4000 million Ferrari car destroyed with his window and he put the water in there is come out in his bumper. The car makes so sound like a supercar go fast and take no dammit he doing the donuts and you take a fun ride and he said in a roof oh you’re trying to get you to do dirty car are you about to stop putting no animals in there because because those animals you drive me so crazy and you put corner in your car and you pull gas in one of your car is started fire
Bro is no way Cody buy a 4000 Ferrari car. His Ferrari car is red like a supercar. I know what he goes fast. I like his car because it is gonna press if you rub it so fast and you did not destroy it.

RANDOM BULL S**T GO!! 13:19
I thought this was actually ridiculous and stupid to do because how impractical do you have to be to test a car. But then I saw the muffin tray thrown at the car and then it all made sense. Now I know my car is safe from my wife.
The Ferrari is actually doing good fr but he also gotta take it easy cause  that car is not made of nothing he can really hurt himself if he does something wrong
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉
wow.😦
Fun part is when you watch it and you see happiness but you know that it will go on fire

POV : Making ur money's worth😂
Bro what you doing to your Ferrari that too stupid
Polska

Great driving through the field.  I used to have a race track around my trailer in Rochester on Bessmore Park road my car was a 1969 4 door Impala 327.  Still have the car.
Cody really out here doing what we all wish we had the balls to do...and the money
Omg why, bro this car is masterpiece, in Italia this is disrespect 😢
SHOULD YOU TRY TESLA IF ITS DURABILITY!
CAN YOU GIVE THE FERRAI TO ME?🤣🤣🤣
is it the ferrari sf90?
It’s literally like watching a high bogey movie
Now we know why Ferrari put the skid plate on!!! They actually made it for him!!!
how do they get the money for this every second video xD
Il ragazzo più fuori di you tube
They do the funny cartoon thing and scream every time something is thrown off screen, I love it.
So.... did he ever get sued?
If you help homeless with this 4 hundred thousand dollars you may get few hundred millions views .
Vedio was sponsered by Lambo😅
ferrari is hella gay tbh
That sounds AMAZING 10:12
SO AN ASSHOLE DUMB U R!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
🎉🎉🎉
“Give me a hammer” famous last words😂😭😭
11:47 It‘s https:// not https//:
First words; please don’t buy it to destroy it.
Why does the blanket on the car say ‘Lamborghini Huracan STO’?
He was definitely removed from the able to buy a new Ferrari list.
you left the tow hitch on the whole time  🤣
i  own  ferrrari   fa  black too
This guy might have money but he’s got the brains of a 5 year old in the body of an adult. One day he might grow up.
Djdneavwahjoqndpsbwsnssvza🎉🎉🎉🎉cdvs😊😊😊😊😊fzh
why don't give it to me as charity?
Mabey stop collecting money from your fans and destroying high end vehicles and start doing give aways I'm sure your fans would like to mabey win something then you destroying it
great ad for the protective bubble
Tesla, sure. Ferrari 😢
Your driving skills though 👌
It's not fun at all
I love how he slapped a Lambo cover on the Ferrari - Ferruccio Lamborghini’s beef against Ferrari really kickstarted the whole Lambo empire makes this more funny! 😁😁
This was already 1 year ago?
lkç~ççççççççççççççççççççççççççççççççççççççççççççççç                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      oi
bro lives in forza horizon 5
This car got used unlike 90% of them that will be stored away and never hit the road.
1:44 foreshadowing........
This guy play's gta in real life 😂👍💪
can we talk about the fact the Ferrari was covered with a Lamborghini cover at the beginning
I was expecting a durability test. It still looks brand new
He probably got permission from Ferrari 5:31
He’s surprisingly competent driver
That ending was hilarious I was literally dying of laughter. It looks like a cartoon scene where they're just pelting someone with random objects. xD
feling apart? do you even have an education?
0:40 youre gonna get sued for that logo
Im poor, can you give me a BMW 140i xdrive for gift? I don t ask much, only mydreamcar 😅  Im sorry that Ferrari caught fire, you could see in your eyes , that even though you took it to do destroi test , 😅 that it was an important car for you carrer in youtube channel..   A remember a BMW 140 i for me please 😊❤
Oh god. I can’t watchhhhhhhh
He drives that thing like its a freaking toy
Bro what the name of this one
im sorry is that 3 porcha 930 turbo's behind him in the intro?! jezus fuck my guy is a classic collector and destroyer.
It amazes me that these kids are doing stuff just like me and my friends did for fun getting paid for it.   Sounds crazy ,but this suits real in a young man's head
You should put 10 foot tall wheels on a Ferrari
Who gave cody a drivers license 😂?
The spit on the logo was hilarious... you got my thumbs up
Can you please buy one of Stradman's cars and break in right in front of him...
Why? Such a waste! Can someone educate me as to why this is not just such an absolute waste?
I love this channel and the type of content thats usually on here.   Its fun to watch, but even if I had the money I think it would still be really hard for me to damage expensive and new things.  I get it, its just stuff.  But I get sad if I scratch on my car.  I guess it would be different if I knew I could easily replace or fix it.
Bro is like a grown ass 13 year old christian boy that never got in trouble for a single fucking thing their shitty behavior has caused. Literally rolling on the ground after drawing a dick on a horse. What a fuckin spaz, lmao.
This is how these cars should really be driven though! 🤣
Now instead driving it in a corn filed drive it in a wheat field
where was the kitchen sink at the end?
why you fasen your seat? better dont do that
This was the best commercial Ferrari could ever do. Seeing sports cars take a hit is valuable. They need to stop being such primadonnas about their appearance.
2025 anyone? 👇
dude, be easy on that r/c ford raptor! don't throw it at a ferrari like som sort of lunatic!
We have to be careful about accidentally deploying the airbag on the driveway ... proceeds to slam into gate at high speed. 💀
Love how natural everything is.  Just do what you feel like, not sure if there's much scripting or rehearsing, I'm sure this is some... but this is some genius stuff.  Really like the plastic cover over the Ferrari. I learn a lot from this channel.  They should teach this stuff in school
Pov:mě in forza😂
What an idiot
bull shit car, hate it.
Video idea: buy a Lambo and destroy it since they don’t have that policy that you cant destroy it that means you cant get sued
Kid can drive to be fair! Not as easy is it looks with all that power to the rear. Not what I’d do with an f8 but it sure looks fun! Screw snobby Ferrari…!
Hey Whistling Diesel, I'll trade you my 2010 Kia Forte Coupe EX 5-speed, St8 up for a Ferrari...... ?????
Bros Lawyer is gonna cry after this video

Can you buy me a 2010 black  harley street glide with bags and a batwing fairing and I promise to make it last my whole life?
Best car video I have ever seen
Should have destroyed that thing like you did the cybertruck. First thing that comes to my mind is Asshole owned Italian junk, just for the reason you said.
I very much hate loud sports cars, they are stupid and they should not be legal, ferrari suck balls
As if the purrari is an Ontario Canada license plate
Dude you are a fuckin animal.. I can't afford to buy a fuckin mini van. To haul my wheel chair. And I'm watching you destroy a new fuckin Ferrari. Awesome my Dude You are definitely the man of Youtube videos my friend. Keep on making this "prime-time" YouTube television My man. I no I love watching them. To all the haters.... Watch it. Hit the like Button. And quit your fuckin Bitchin.

don;t go on a gravel road go on a paved road
13:17 best ad ever lmao
Most expensive Temu cars ever made they are shotty af.   pretty sure they even sued a guy who put a Ferrari engine ins his STI for rally, saying it infringed on their copyright and "didn't fit their image"  literally all he did was swap the engine STIl body and because the engine still had the logo, they went after him. hes a fellow YT'r
if you bought ferrari its you'r car y can do what you want so what if they sue you :D its you'r property

I love how the demise of the car in the next video is unintentionally foreshadowed.
Are you so rich ?
Wtf😂 4:04

I just did the same thing in GTA V.
This brings me pain to see this beautiful piece of work to be bought for what one may call a fortune, but o be destro6ed in such an inhuman way
Based on this test, I’m ordering one in red- plus all that other crap to protect my investment.
This is how I drive when I play gta

i havent seen a WD video in awhile but... for a channel that advertises no clickbait, im pretty bummed you didn't destroy this car.
For real this video just proves: how stupid you wanted your kid to be and how much money you wanted to spend in less than 15 minutes...  $400.000 seems about okay...  Man for real this guy is straight down dumb and a whole new level.... 😅😂😂😂
This is what you get when a billionaire has an stupid kids and just gives him all his money 🤑💰

I don't care about the durability that much. I just wanna have that crazy Driving experience on this thing.
Paganis are super durable you know...especially the limited production ones!
You're a fucking super idiot person that I’ve ever seen because most people do not have cars and you buy those cars just in order to destroy them. An idiot will not do that. Who the fuck are you?  You're doing so that you can gain more subscribers on YouTube and on the entire social media. Be a man, not a stupid child. A child would not do that. 🤨🤨🤨 Shame on you. 😡
You're a legend
No
I always assumed these cars were fragile.  I'm impressed.
Best ferrari commercial
Perfetto
We getting out of the Courtroom with this one 🔥🔥🗣🗣

There's a Lamborghini under that tunnel

Buggati chiron to destroy
When he was driving in the field it reminded me of forza Horizon
You are a man of stunts and Ferrari lending you one has become (finally) a positive publicity stunt. :]
For this guy, our fantasies are everyday life.
someone should use that to protext there cars before HURRICANE MILTON HITS TBH! #staysafe floridians
Yo, bro, are you fire? Everyone download a file to file called Ferrari no Viya💩 cup Ferrari no no no no no no no no no no

Bad ass car
Hey Ferrari! I didnt give you permission to put the money i gave you for one of your Ferraris in your bank nor to pay your employees. Ima sue you for misusing my money I used to buy one of your Ferraris🤡 Ferrari is stupid to sue their customers who modify their cars. If they won’t let u modify your cars then they should just not sell you their cars. Porsche is better anyway.
Send me a Ferrari key
All the cars he has destroyed are like what did we do to you well over here the Ferrari
10:05 THE HUDSON HORNET
Bored American kid! To people who create real values ​​and don't even reach their ankles! It's time to sit down with such buddhists and stop watching their useless content! This will force them to really create something.

Do pagani
Bro you are crazy, but I love the vids 🤣🤣🤣💪🏾
I was excited about your channel until I watched a few episodes. It seems like your thing is destroying high dollar cars which to some (obviously a lot judging by your subscriber numbers) might be cool but to true car lovers it just seems wrong. I guess those who can't rebuild, destroy instead.
I want to see him do a koneingseg
What a waist of a stunning car 😢
Did you have somebody else buy this? Ferrari has to approve buyers even for reselling used. No possible way you arent on a blacklist.
hay whistlin diesel i am a big fan i watched you sence i was 7 and now im 9 i wish i can meet you in real life from DAMONI SMITH
Noooo...

Monster wheels

Ferrari fanboys are in agonizing pain watching this.
I wanna come to your house cause I am a big fan
Nice car. Totally more control than that shitty Mustang.
Why did Cody throw a muffin tin at the bubble😂
I realy love the videos and see the fun of it. I'm LOL for sure. But Otherwise somethings I think, what a waste of money that could be better spend. Support the community, some institutions who could use your support!
Bro this man is crazy
&$^% the citizens! #FingerRespect 'Murica
That Ferrari protector bubble never had this good of a marketing strategy as this.
4:16 is that a supra in the back you should totally durability test that
Always loved durability tests. I broke a lot of toys as a kid. ! Subscribed ! Keep on doing it !!!!

It’s crazy how bro wasted 400,000 on a Ferrari just to destroy it💀
I would have just taken it off your hands free of charge or if u wanted to pay me to take it I would be ok with that too😅
WHY?  I cried every minute of this video.  lol
Please don't destroy the car 😅
now destroy a koegniseg
+ Romans 10:9-10 "That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.  For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved

This is so painful to watch!😢 How can I unsee this😢
Not even the same car jackass. One has tented windows and the one your driving doesn’t.
1:28 the porsche in the background
I’m assuming that that can get wet 😂
Ferrari probably blacklists him after this lol
Thick-fil-la??? Now chick-fil-la gonna sue you.
I enjoy watching these expensive cars get destroyed just as much as the next person but it seems like such a waste.  Sometimes it just hurts to see
I'll change whatever I want on my Ferrari if I get one I fuckin challenge you Ferrari to try and stop ms
bro threw his entire workshop at the ferrari bubble 😭
Unfortunally i do not care was so expected and good 🤣🤣

13:35 Now that's good advertising
the gun shots :kek
Bro wants to get sued
try Rolls-Royce
7:19 why does the car in one shot have no back number plate then the next shot have one?
It's a shame to waste so much money that could have been used by many good people in need, or to help the country.
I like coming back to this every few months. For the most part, Ferrari makes beautiful cars, but their company is a piece of shit which makes this so satisfying to watch. 😂
how rich is bro
Is that the same car as in when he visited the urban rescue ranch
3:48 they turned it into a Ferrari Penisangue
Dumb as they come.
Ferrari thinks their customers are renting the car from them for 400 000 instead of purchasing it
never imagined a id see a luxury sports car being toyed with
Bro is playing gta in real life
How did you even get a new Ferrari? You have to be on their good boy list for that, don't you?

What but it’s it illegal to destroy a Ferrari
The protective bubble is the real mvp
I disagree. Its not the average every day person buying a cyber truck. Its dumb rich people that got it way too easy and don't know what to do with their money.
Cool
Don’t do that 10 seconds later he is onto of the car and jumping an it
5:44 Kellers reaction to Cody standing on the roof is hilarious 😂
Someone's dream someone's toys
*Junge, was stimmt mit dir nicht?!?* 🤦‍ Such dir mal einen richtig gut Therapeuten............

0:12 lawsuit for lambo cover
“Give me a hammer” proceeds to get a whole mechanic shop thrown
8:23 GTA right there
I honestly considered Ferrari as not to impressive and delicate!  This has literally changed my entire reality regarding Ferrari!   I am now a huge believer 👍🏼.
The money he wast could help so many people.
Did this get filmed before the whole "spit on that Thang?" cause I feel that would have been perfect with the sharpie logo alteration...
Going through the tunnel Going through the tunnel Lamborghini Huracan behind you

The Ferrari Wanted Level was the funnies add on 🤣🤣
Nobody gonna talk about that Doug DeMuro cameo at 3:18????? At least Shmee150 replied.
Ford lightening vs cyber truck
The absolutely best commercial for this car bubble thing you could imagine😅👍
If Ferrari doesn’t like their cars in dangerous situations, then why are there almost 30 of them in Forza and one in Fortnite?
ouch
And I am struggling to buy a Dacia Duster for 7500 euros..:D
Bros a menace to cars💀
You can get sued by Ferrari
Not going to lie this infuriates me, most people would love to have a car like this, n people just destroy it crazy.
Nice now you cant buy another One
the ending was unexcepted 😂😂😂
That was an excellent review for the bubble wrap!
Unironically, this is an amazing ad
Not gonna lie that sounds amazing
Society 's menace is back 😂😂😂😂😂 ... who beats up a Ferrari 😂😂😂
Love how ppl talk shit about Cody. Ppl are just jealous and I’m jealous because he can do anything he wants to but I’m happy for him is the difference
THIS COULD B UR LAST TIME THEY  ALOW U TO   PUCHURUSE FERRAR EN THEY WIL SUW UR ASS😂 AFTER THIS VEDIO

I'm just here to compliment you on your driving. People can't even handle these things on asphalt, and you're doing perfect donuts and sliding into camera frame on a gravel hill.
yo you should do a collab with mrtaxtherich100

next: F22 durability test

Subtitle Indonesia pliss😢
So painful just to watch😢
Homosexuals are taking over the world
i userscribed because you destoy good cars that can be used
Yo wouldn't it be fun if you bought a Ferrari but made an exact cheaper copy of it, indistinguishable from the original and use that for a video where you abuse of it as usual. Then you get sued by them and after you go like "oh, that wasn't even a real Ferrari" and enjoy their reaction. PRICELESS.
You should try Rally! You would probably be good at it, and have lots of fun in your farm! Rally cars can do everything!
So we have a guy playing gta 6 even before gta 6 came out.
@ferrari
😂
is bro shitting money or sum
Mustang better cus the snoot don’t droop
Why would you want to destroy a Ferrari those are so nice your just wasting money to destroy stuff if I had a 400K$ Ferrari I would keep it not destroy it
I want to buy one of those big car condoms for my honda civic dont want any accidents to happen👶
He's like lil bro on Forza
I could be wrong but I’d assume this didn’t help: Ferrari actually had a car get forged by Tony Tetro, it was a fake 1958 Ferrari 250 Testarossa TR58 made from hand altered body panels and with hand painted emblems  I’m sure there are many other reasons why Ferrari is so so struck with customization and use but Tony Tetro probably didn’t help that lol-
14:09 _Purrari:_ *IS THAT ALL YOU GOT?!?!*
اتنا امیر ہونا چاہتا ہوں کہ خود کی فراری لے کر اس پر اس قسم کی حرکتیں کر سکوں 😂😅
we want koenigsegg in next video :D

This hurts to watch this 😭
"One of their best cars" Ferrari...I don't know. Needs a freakin whole support team just to run one single drag race.
where does he get the money
I think the Ferrari was actually tougher than the Cybertruck
Tu ferais mieux d offrir une Ferrari à un passionné de voiture au lieu de la détruire
Suited
Not my sense of humor and a terrible waste of money and material.
🗿
Forza Horizon IRL
Bro really???
“Gimme a hammer” Proceeds to unleash everything in his left pocket
The fact that it’s been a year later and the 2nd video that pops up when you type in Ferrari is this one… PR team be stressing in Italy 😂
Someone need to make 5:50 and edit

Bro stop pls stop and just gimme the next car
Вам очень далеко до Итальянцев и Немцев . Ломайте свои ржавые пикапы
Hes such a good driver
missed opportunity not throwing a kitchen sink at the car at the end
I feel like Ferrari is like an hoa neighborhood. Yea you can buy this with your money and own it but you can’t do anything with it.
Let's see, you y'all watched the cyber truck video and then after some time this video got recommended and them you started watching it..............I mean this is at least my story : )

Why the fuck would they add a toe hook to a car that will most likely get you sued if you treat it bad😂
14:00 HowToBasic but with no eggs?

Did someone notice the cover on the car? "He started off bullying Ferrari with Lamborgini cover from the beginning of the video.
Ferrari is going to personally arrest him

Dude’s playing real life forza horizon
Best ad for a bubble car protector ever? Yes, I think so. lol
Every TDAH kid lmao
I think ferrari only sues u if ferrari doesn't like u
That did pretty well.  But the biggest problem with the prancing horse is their tendency to burn to the ground.  Just sayin'...
Literally me playing forza

4:41 LMAO
1:02: Purrari 😆  Ferrari should incorporate this airbag as a standard feature, auto-deploying whenever you park and exit the vehicle.
It must be smooth everywhere in America. In Malawi that car wouldn't last City Center to Old Town in Lilongwe the Capital City.
Love your videos ... its kinda like you are playing GTA but in real life
Did you contact Ferrari and ask if your warranty is still valid after your extreme test drive??😅
painful to watch
That's as good as it gets. Good job.
Imagine what bro would do with an f1 car 💀
I believe there are things that ONLY CODY has experienced.  Also, I have no idea what to feel about this person. One person said it best "he is like if your worst impulses had a baby with your intrusive thoughts, came to life and started a YouTube channel.
W to the bubble for being the only one to repel damaging blows
User:Enzo Ferrari typing...
It's like all the ppl with negative comments can't seem to realize that messing stuff up and acting crazy is kind of Cody's brand I guess lol. It certainly gets a F-ton of views and subscribers. He's not a stupid guy, he just plays a stupid guy on his channel lol. If you see him on other ppls channels or off camera(which I haven't), he usually just acts like a regular guy. He's def got great taste in cars, trucks, dogs, properties, friends, employees and how he goes about messing stuff up lol etc etc. And he's usually looking out for the ppl around him when he's doin stuff so that shows he does have an understanding of safety stuff. Be safe Cody and keep on keeping on ✌️✌️
I'm impressed with the ferrari durability
The hole in hood is dynamic s
that was a $270,000 car new. urs is used. $400k my butt lol
we will figth

F*** f***
bro having some issue with ferrari specialy red one
Bro its a horse not a bull.. Farreri logo..
🤣🤣🤣🤣 i would pay money to see Ferrari executives watching this video 🤣🤣🤣
All that for vues
im seeing a lot of comments saying that "enzo would probably approve", or "yeah this car had an eventful life" and other bullshit like this... this is definitely not what this car is meant for, and he definitely has too much money compared to his brain. to treat a car like this in this way u just gotta be a dumbass with too much money than you probably deserve. enjoy your sunday ride with it, rip it off an highway hitting 300+ km/h, hit the track with it, hit how many city streets you want, go get groceries with it, bring your kid to school with it, go to car meet with it, do basically whatever tf you want with it, and use it for what it was really thought to be used, with respect for it and for people whos life dream is to have a car like this
This looks extremely fun 🤙
That car is so nice❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The camera guy worries me.
Vay ap
Lol I get the same shit, you can't weld that, buuullll schloken

LMFAO at the bubble test, that's product endorsement.

Is the fact that you have no respect for anything of value because you have enough money to waste actually you look like an idiot.
If I had it I wouldn’t destroy it
I dont what is more pathetic, this guy tearing up a car that costs more than most peoples houses or the sheep that actually think its entertainment. If you are older than 12 and think this is cool I feel sorry for you.

just press this link and see that you get..... https://drivingdreamsdaily.blogspot.com/2023/10/land-rovr-dfndr-exploring-th-iconic.html
Actually a really good rally car. A sounds so sick. R.I.P
This is disgusting.  Kid has too much money
can you destroy lamborghini huracan the same?
Stupid question but what's in all those cases along the wall in the shop?
That poor fence why would you treat it so bad,you hit it for no reason!! The Tree and stick also what is wrong with you!!!!
You have to sign a contract and abide by it in order to buy a Ferrari. You basically don't even own it.
This Will be a big damage for car lovers🥵🙂

Who came back here after watching Cody burn this Ferrari to the ground?
I love this video. F  Ferrari
So thats what happening when youtubers have too much money
pfff done that in forza...
The picture of a burned car
Why did bro just waste $400,000?
I love Ferraris, but this was a nice video
That's how tests should be done 😂 😂
zero respect for whoever thought of, designed and built this car practically by hand. you are an idiot, Ferrari should blacklist you and ban you from buying any other Ferrari car. (as well as zero respect for those who dream of a car like this and will never be able to afford it)
Hope you guys know, it's not a really Ferrari, it's a look alike, a good lookalike. They use lookalikes in the movies too. Movie producers could never afford to blow up the real thing.
Why was the cover a Lamborghini?
11:05 me after Taco Bell

That is stupid
"Ferrari lawyers joined the chat" Yo
Though it is painful watching a Ferrari be driven like this on gravel and dirt, the camera shots being captured are amazing.
This the kid from Blank Check?
The gripen has both the 1 circle and 2 circle over the F-15
Literally more money than brains
Who’s watching this in 2024?
He had to much fun but to be honest i would probably have a lot of fun as well
Despite he being a influential content creator, Why Ferrari hasn’t sued him yet..🤔🤔🤔 fuking strange
You are expecially an idiot!!! ;c
imagine i dream of bmw e46 and he just destroys a ferrari
black list guaranteed
Give me that ferrari 😭
dude how to u have the atherote to do this
Thats smart...  try a $1 million car next time...
Get a cyber tesla truck 😂😂

I've never seen anything more stupid and useless... Rest assured that Ferrari will never sell you a car again.
Bros playing forza IRL
A mate of mine owns a 1991 ferrari and honestly it looks and feels thrown together
Bro done everything
Id have a problem with him smashing up an F40 or F50 or Enzo, or 288GTO, or 250GTO, or..................but anything post Enzo, when they started to get pretentious im cool with. $400,000 for something I can't even really call my own. Your going to send a lawsuit my way because I took MY PROPERTY and did whatever I damn well choose to do with it? I would send an absolute D Day level barrage of profanity Ferraris way, but I think Whistling D has done a FAR better job. Here's the voice of the little guy you scumbags.
I’m sorry when it comes down to having a sports card like that you standing on the roof and the chain hopefully you don’t get it at least you to be a real asshole
this was so hard to watch

Diesem Vollidioten sollte mal jemand gepflegt die Häußliche Fratze polieren, sie sollten sich lieber vor Enzos Erbe verneige diese ortsbekloppten Hillbilliys. Wenn Sie mal wieder einen solchen Wagen loswerden müssen dann schickt ihn lieber zu mir Ihr Vollaffen.

Sorry Ferrari.....we love you

This is almost an advertisement for them, cuz it actually performed pretty great if you were ever allowed to enjoy your property and the bubble was especially effective.
Perhaps a true testament to what the Toyota Crown Sp…I mean Purosangué wished it could do.
Such a dumbass...

Bro thinks he is in game😂😂
He literally drived it like it was a normal tractor with full throttle 😂
Povero americano ignorante...  This video it's just pathetic. You could buy 100 Ferrari... You would remain a poor american ignorant

But I’d be buying 62 Chevrolet impala, 65 Cadillac de ville, 70 Chevrolet c10, 56 Chevrolet handyman wagon, 62 Chevrolet bel air wagon, 67 Ford Shelby GT500 mustang  🤤😊🤗🥰 all pimped out. Big engines. Best of the best.

Where is the in-car video shots of the Ferrari, when it was attacked while being in that bubble? I'm sure you people throw at the top of the Ferrari, cause the distance to that "protective" bubble at the doors and wheels is smaller compared to the top. Nice video, I quiet liked it.
And we all know how this story ends! And all he had was liability so cars not covered at all. He’s out 400k. Dude must make money… I wonder what his income actually is??

Ferrari blacklisted
This man is not normal he destroy a ferrari!?!?
Bad Karma company
May the Lord God delivery you my brother 🙏🏽
Looks like a c8
The sight of a guy purchasing a Ferrari with the sole intention of destroying it is undeniably perplexing. While I appreciate his content creation and understand the appeal of unique and daring stunts, I can't help but feel that a Ferrari transcends mere machinery; it is art on wheels. Art should never be treated so rashly, and this holds true for the exquisite craftsmanship and engineering that goes into creating a Ferrari. I don't harbor any ill will towards his creative endeavors, but there's a pang of regret knowing that such an exquisite piece of automotive artistry could have been cherished and celebrated rather than subjected to stunts that damage the vehicle.
Googly eyes on the horse 🤣🤣🤣🤣
i was dying at 13:18
let's be real he's doing what we all would want to do
Well I hope Ferrari be repelling you after this video. As a whole, for ever.

our community have everything only when we control the lower castes people to reduce population then only we become developed nation the excessive population crisis and non implementation of Sterilisation program it need to be implemented from peon to member of parliament by hook or crook in all religions in bharat Males who are wasting their precious time from age 21 to 32 years just in preparation of various exams are creating trouble by reproducing and every male must write his surname clearly he belongs to which religion and which caste general category Shudra or Obc This time we all Rajput's and brahmins must unite together call for all Females and males of our community to prevent explosion of population and for resources of india The corruption is at its peak in bharat all the institution is only indulged in corruption from private to govt sectors the gram panchayat to nagar paalika nagar nigam the mayor of Pune jaipur lucknow takes 10 to 20% commission in any project and these lawyers with police and administration and politicians are make loot with unemployment at its peak in bharat All bars and benches are under the one community The Rajputs, Jaats Brahmins and kayastha only real rajputs not those backwards lodhs etc Politicians apart from party making mockery of people they hand in glove with each other across parties and in this bureaucracy, executive and bars and bench are involved Inside india now the universities just busy in making politicians by making fool to poor and lower class people educated unemployment is on its high I will name the universities Delhi ,awadh, ccs, kanpur, Devi ahilya, jadhavpur ,jaipur, only busy in making politicians by grabbing money from common educated people This is very ugly face of politics in bharat the politicians and their family members are only getting rich and wealthy while common educated people are continuously suffering in bharat I will repeatedly raise the issues what all political persons are doing from gram panchayat to parliament of India only nepotism in every field whether legislature executive or judiciary and so called fourth pillar the media and mediahouses running by businesshouses the politicians with bureaucracy executive and judiciary in high courts and supreme courts are blocked by few people from past 75 years and India is suffering of educated unemployment at its peak we are moving towards stagflation with politicians and businessmen who are politicians and their relatives are continuously getting benefitted  explosion of population must be dealt with heavy hand This time world community have to come forward to deal with excessive population of world and the govt in india is repeating again with bjp rest unemployment will remain bcoz politicians are equally corrupt like people made them across all the political parties common people is just a tool nothing more We females representation is very less in all curriculum courses in politics executive judiciary medical engineering needs more  The universities &schools must reduce excessive pressure on children and youths by making 50 -50% mcq and theory based examination in all domains from class 11 to ph.d.   this is to be applied at earliest we are witnessing suicides in India at peak

R.I.P. Ferrari F8. 20 February 20 2023 - August 19 2023
Starts the video off by trolling Ferrari with a Lambo car cover. This dude gives zero fucks lol.
🪦 Ferrari
How much money can 1 young man have, unimaginable. Why ? I know because whay not? lol
This reminds me of forza. Driving your super car through the corn field. Good ol days.

Fucking Question Time: My question is: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This sum forza type shit
What bubble did you get for that car I want it for two of my cars???
Definitely no destroying. Rare clickbait.
When you play forza in real life
retard
I like how the cover of the car at the start of the video is from a Lamborghini hues can evo
rich parents with stupid and valueless children 🤮🤮🤮🤮
You were supposed to destroy this Ferrari and you didn't, so it's clickbait
Cease and descist
@13:14 my favorite part
Crazy  😜😩😩😩😩
8:00 non rp driving
This is how people living in poverty; on less than a dollar a day look at people living in the West. We seem like giant assholes ruining supercars to people who have nothing.
This video is gonna be the one that makes him lose out on insurance money. He might even get sued by Ferrari
Classic😂
idk why he do this
Buggati 😂
make sure not to take into a corn field or anything
Some people will do anything for attention.  Like drive a Ferrari through a cornfield until it catches fire and burns down to an unrecognizable pile of melted rubble and debris.
This guy is doing all the shit I’d do if I won the lottery. Good for you man good to see someone actually enjoying themselves.
Overpromised, underdelivered
i hope one day you eat from the garbage .(.
LoL
GTA V in real life 🥲😂
This is monster car
Well done, surprising that the street tires moved that car up those mountains. Imagine what it would do with bigger wheel arches and mud tires. Be sure to post a short with you holding the cease and desist letter. Hope it's hand signed. I wonder how much they rack up in postage just for C&D correspondence 😆
and destroy he did
Man I just loved your video you have put your end effort most amazing video. I wish I could have this vehicle. I searched this video after I watched 4 months back today I watched again. Plz if you could give me this car as a gift it will be like dream come true. Cheers
So 6 months to destroy a ferrari...... Well done, i dont really care because ferraris are over rated
I love it drive the car but enjoy life the most.
Mustangs deserve this. Not sure about Ferraris.🤣
Rip Ferrari it was a really nice car actually glad it wasn't a McLaren p1 that would have been worst😢
lol that lamborghini car cover on the ferrari is insulting
13:47 the cat
What
Necesito este canal en versión español 😁👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
GTA V vibes
This needs giant caster wheels
now we need to see if the car bubble can stop 120mm apfsds from a tank
I don't care how much money someone has... he could be Elon himself for the least I care, but that's just disrespectful to the car and also to the time and efforts engineers have put into crafting something like that...
So THAT'S where this clip came from.
that's so painful to watch
Bro is playing Forza hi real life
People like this are like rich or **** they don't deserve nice cars like this only the thing they deserve is a pedal car these guys had massive **** **** makes everybody else mad when he does the cars and everything else
society should run of the basis of circulation of heath, hygiene, safety and humanity rather than circulation of paper money.
You should have no money at all. There are people that need money on life saving surgerys and they dont have it meanwhile you waste money
Me: mom why we cant buy me pc Mom:we dont have a lot of money Random guy on internet:
one of hes new video he do burnout in a cornfield and the cornfield catch on fire
“Ferrari is Italian trash.”
They are all waists of money.
This is the most fun anyone can have with a Ferrari. A big slap to people who buy Ferrari to flex it in their garage.
Nah bros playing GTA at this point
I ricchi sono il problema più grande del mondo
I do not represent Ferrari but i would sue you too. I cant watch this
regarding the outcome of his Ferrari, I would really like to know if he was sued by Ferrari. I mean it already has to happen. It's Ferrari, there's a reason they are known for that.
Useless, totally useless
This is what happens when money falls in the wrong hands
Watching this after the corn fields video. This is a legend!! RESPECT BROO!!
The gun shot sound when throwing stuff on the Ferrari 👏
This is not normal, please give the car away, i love to have this car !!
ferrari committed suicide herself 💀
What an absolute bell end.
schlechter drift
Bro for the bubble, next time use 50 bmg with a sniper to destroy your Ferrari
Yo are so dum
Bro i was crying the whole time😢
Cool cars behind you
It's a pile of Ash now
What did that bubble do to you? A little excessive but impressive. Should sell that clip to the manufacturer's. Great ad material.
honestly, whistlindiesel is just a product tester and usually end up making a better ad than the company's ever could, like Ferrari now has a free add, and whoever makes the bubble thing probrably sold several cause damn it works lol
A Ferrari with a Lamborghini cover
That video hurts so much to watch for real😅😢
0:39 why does that sheet say lamborghini but underneath it is a ferrari
13:18 till end 😂😂😂😂😂
Painful to watch… probably my first ever comment on internet
People follow u ,just u 4 being stupid 😂
Supra?
this guy is playing forza horizon in real life
That aged well
😂Give me one car to go to school 😊
Now who wants to buy a red Ferrari 458 in superb condition
Simple, you're an American you can't understand what art is. You need to test it...
welp
These are our dreams and some that kind of YouTubers enjoy to destroy it.
Did he get in any trouble from Ferrari or f them
To funny I'm in stitches
With so much hunger, misery, war, suffering children, and so much more suffering, the $400k show of destruction It is a manifestation not only of bad taste and arrogance, but a criminal mockery of all the suffering in the world.. I hope Ferrari will sentence you to money that will really hit you. I hope they try you for crimes against humanity
13:20 pov: the 3D models that you download for your racing game
Ferrari needs to make an W2C rally team
he's literally playing Forza IRL
bro if you dont want the ferrari i am here for you
You have wasted so much money...            …Pour out the water at the beginning of the video

brother, you could have used that money to feed the homeless or feed poor animal shelters
ehhh
stupid video for stupid people

@ the Doug DeMuro cameo lmao
I bet it's fun af bein his friend always havin a blast!!

We converted a Mercedes Sprinter into a floating amphibious van, which means an incredibly huge amount of modifications, and Mercedes just told us that we should put our logo on there somewhere, or take their Mercedes logo off, because it's basically not a Mercedes anymore, but otherwise they said good job.
6 months later, they actually destroyed it, accidentally but it’s still destroyed.
i love how the tow hook was attached to the car the whole time he was drifting n shit 💀
And now you destroy it
Absolutely SICKENING.....    ;-(
Bro, stop!! Do it with VW, Toyota or Volvo or any car just leave that beautiful car alone.
Did they trow a rc car
Literally me in forza horizon 😂😂😂
Well look who else has joined the Ferrari blacklist. But honestly I don’t feel bad at all for him thrashing the crap out of this thing. It’s quite satisfying tbh
you've done it
6 months later and it has finally endured this mans torture lol

Seems like a regular Saturday on the farm to me, I just  wonder how many hill climbers are thinking they need a Ferrari now?
That Ferrari is a lease and has 19 history reports against it........ Seems like an insurance job scam to me. Heres the proof  https://i.postimg.cc/5N8hXXZ7/Screenshot-2023-08-28-035158.jpg
This reminded me of Forza Horizon 😄
Dude and his crew is going to get a Ferrari R.I.C.O😂
Bro is playing forza in real life
If I would have to describe this channel I would say it’s like Top Gear but instead for car enthusiasts it’s for ppl who hate them.
1:42 Foreshadowing
RIP😢 the Ferrari will be in our hearts always
It’s funny because this car burned to dust like 6 months later
Dude didn't lie
I hope this pissed Ferrari off. Fuck Ferrari.
GTA in reallife
Video satisfaction 😂
So sad 😂😂
India 🇮🇳 lm you love you
Well, mission completed
well done…. 6 months later and there is nothing left …🤣
You’re a waste
Was it of money tho-
😊😊😊😂😂❤❤❤
That was really satisfying. Thank you 🎉
not click-bait it turns out...
Привет Американцы как вы привет из Таджикистана 🇹🇯
that did not age well
Sometimes it's hard to believe, that such retards even get a  driving license.
why?
Mission accomplished.
This aged well, video's 🔥 though dude
i have question you like to only destroy or something else if i will ask you 1 dollar can you send me😊)))))
This video and the idea behind it... just plain stupid.
Hey imagine if the car got destroyed I’m so glad he treated it well
i wanna do this so badly
when you take a ferrari off road
I love this smiling the whole time!!!
Bro they gave it everything they got
Best vid ever
And destroy it he did. This video aged like fine wine.
Wow
I hate idiots 😐
Bro is the walking definition of rich and bored
A car is the worst investment until you destroy it and put it on the Internet. I wonder how much money did he get back.
He covers Ferrari with Lamborghini clothe.💀💀💀💀
little did he know
1:44 uh oh
I cant believe jersey channel islands made it into a whistlindiesel video, repping my home island 💪
Destroyed by... climate change
before u destroyed it, you should give it to me and ill sell for 600k$ then buy another for 400k$ and sell it for 600k$ then i will buy 2 ferraris and for infinite to 50 milion $ and a private jet :)) Big Brain
put some amish wheels on the next one you get and I guarantee those shitters at ferrari will get an aneurysm.
Money has power guys 😮
6 months later he well and truly destroyed it
I that when you are ripping down the road, the tow bar is stuck on the car.
Your are next level man
Dude, your attitude is awful! You don't respect anything. If you don't respect it, you don't deserve it. Obviously, this car is not made for off-road driving, buy a tractor instead.
I guess the durability test wasn’t incomplete after all 😭😂😂
I think you should worry about going OFF road haha😂
6 Months later, BOOM! here's how.
Lol car guys. It's so hard to watch this video lol. I'm with Big Red
Too much money and not enough brains
i like for you😁😁😄😄😃😁😆
Mr D  Plz teach me how to drive Any car Any manner. As long as I learn
guy destroying 400 000$ while millions of american children has no breakfast in the morning. Think about that for a minute
this guy is playing forza irl
Mission accomplished boys!
The endless supply of random crap thrown at the car!  Lol
Yes, yes you did...
RIB
RIP
ferrari cancel all customers in twitter
Taxtherich100? Is that you?
Whistin diesel is when you let the intrusive thoughts win

Asking for a Ferrari that isn't red is like asking for the ocean to turn pink. It's not gonna happen.
bro finally blew it up
13:33 BROO EVEN GOT THE BABY WWWWW
What a car would be a shame if it got on fire
Haaaaaaa
Boy did this video not age well 💀🤣
Mr.beast can't do like this.

**sad italian noises**
Make him a brand ambassador 😂
When Top Gear meets Larry the Cable Guy...filmed in the backwoods of Tennessee.

Mission complete successfully 😂😂
Bro forgot about lawsuit totally
Diesel, you are giving a bad message to the kids.
U should get a f1 car
That title didn’t age well 💀
Szkoda auta 😢😢 ale jeszcze ta osłona samochodu od Lamborghini a nie od ferrari😅

Bro The Ferrari really did get Destroyed. He wasn’t lying
This is pure “ENTERTAINMENT” 😂❤
Bro got the lambo cover on the Ferrari 😂
and then it burn down in a field lol
What's in all the crates?
When people say they have "fuck you" money, this is what they mean
This video didn’t age very well
The plastic is really tough. I'm throwing a metal thing, but it won't rip. Supercars are statues, as expected.
You can still hit it from the sides
very, very nice vid bro
8:55 the near same where it will die
Please, I need you guys support on getting 2008Toyota Camry or Toyota Corolla to start a Uber
this guy is mentally disturbed
Hurts me to look at it

Están loquillos.
and after 6 months its gone
wow this car really survived 6months
1:50 foreshadowing
Idiot!  Idiot! Idiot!  Imbecil!  Imbecil!   Imbecil!
Well I guess you did kind of call it
Bro it toke you 6 month to burn it up, like what a disappointment
Who else is watching this after seeing the last video of it catching on fire few days ago? 😅
Whos here after the car burn down😂
Bro u got blacklisted by Ferrari or not ?
It took 6 months but they did it after all.
1:41 "I love the car, I plan to have a lot of fun with it" Do I tell him, or you tell him?
I cringe so hard to this
DUCk XD
What you distroy it??
May she rest in peace. Here from Uncle Bens farm.

Prophetic...
Yeah He destroyed it
First time viewer here - I was ready to hate this video and you when I read the title and ended up laughing my ass off.
Boy do I have news for you...
Now that's an interesting way of testing a product. Good job guys LOL
It's really awesome, I hope you will have return money or piece of it)
bro CHUCKED that red gas can lololol
That horse has a small cock, just like......
Wenn dein Vater gleichzeitig der Bruder deiner Mutter ist, dann kommt sowas raus.. 😂

Only stupidity.
Don't hurt a Ferrari again
RIP 🥺
TEBI OČITO TREBA POMOĆ!!!
This is Highly Entertaining 🎉
Well... you did it 😢
Billion of people on this planet would say: "You could give it to someone for free! What a waste!" And I say, as a poor Polish man: "You did well." I wouldn't take it for free, cuz i can't afford a tire for it.
Congrats
Update: MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!

What Comes to mind=Yellow#P1 Maclaren naturally destroyed!
#Arsonist that starts uncontrolled wild fires Diesel!!!
U r a narcisistic idiota
Burn it in a corn field 😂
Thank you
rip ferrai
Turns out all you need to destroy a ferrari is a cornfield
This aged well
Well, this car is history right now
Yeah he destroyed it alright.
INSTANTLY black listed and sued by Ferrari in .001 milliseconds because of the Lambo cover in the beginning! HAAAA!!!! XD
Let’s have a control: throw all that stuff at the car without the bubble
R.i.p. ferrari, you left this world so early
i love how the car doesnt have a plate and then in next frame it does then 2 frames later it gone again
You threw everything at the bubble except the kitchen sink.  I'm not sold yet.😂 screw Ferrari,  your car, you do what you want to it.
About that
This video aged like good milk
You should put Corvette badges on it
You cant spell ferrari without fire
Little does he know a little couple of months later it's going to be a giant burning pile of ash
Don’t drive through a cornfield, heard it’s sketchy
Who is there after the Ferrari actually coughed on fire
The amount of shit thrown at the end bro had me dying
RIP Ferrari. Probably the only Ferrari I was ever a fan for.
Quality content post waco fireRRARI
This vid could actually very useful research material for Ferrari because I doubt anyone else would have the gall to do this.
RIP Ferrari  ❤
Well.. RIP 🔥
Fucking love this Your bought it fare and square love seeing this
Boy this video aged well
The car is going to be FIRE!!🔥
Mission success
Rest in Peace
Stupid, This guy doesn't deserve these cars

Μαλακισμένα τσογλάνια...

You guys are so fake you might as well just put makeup on. How long will the shock value of this channel will go on... hopefully not long. There's nothing more annoying than a little brat wasting money. There's plenty of Charities and organizations to help people out yet this selfish son-of-a-b**** just throwing money away on destroying stuff so people get shocked value out of it. This guy's an a-hole (SELFISH)
5months later this Ferrari got burnt to the ground
How many different cars were used here
Little did he know.
May she RIP 😢 5:51 That backwards drift and spin was sick!
Moments before disaster         On August 18th it burned...
I wish i had the money to do this shit haha
This didnt age well
11:33 good joke
this aged well
Mobil: kau kira aku apa anj
The holy Trinity fused together to create whislindiesel, the sheer sound of lambos and ferraris are insanely hot
lasted 5 months..
So happy that Ferrari burnt down. What an absolute idiot.
Now its gone xD
Where you getting the money from ?
RIP Cody's Ferrari we will always love you☠
My wife asked why the underside of the horse was blurred out. I said "Well he just picked up a sharpie 3 seconds earlier" And she walked away. lol!
Mission completed succesfully
Well It end up burning in wheat field  What I have to say...HOME SWEET ALABAMA
"I bought a $400,000 Ferrari just to destroy it".........Mission accomplished!
@13:17 That's actually a really good commercial for that bubble thing.
Well... He actually did it🌽🔥🚒🥲
1:44 really happened lol
1:42 as someone who has watched the fate of the Ferrari:  LMAOOO
Watch out if you ever drive it through a dry corn field. Old dead corn stalks could get stuck in your wheel and cause a fire because of how hot the brakes get.
honestly Yeah I guess it makes money when he messes all these expensive vehicles up, but I cant help but want to slap this dude tf out, at least I did...DID..it was so nice watching how hurt he was when it burned..yeah he was hurt..its gone, you fuqboi..haha gone like a tay in the wynn
look at the title......now realize that words are powerful🤯
And it's already gone 😪 by catching fire so sad man  😥😔
Came from uncle ben’s video about the recent bonfire. G’looks, sir
RIP
5 months later, wonder how they are gonna feel about this
this feels like awful foreshadowing after seeing your last video
Whos here after it burned
At this point every car company should ban u so y don't destroy there shit 😂
You're the reason people hate Youtubers. This was definitely the best way you could spend $400,000. It's not like you could do good with that money and get even more views. It's not like the biggest Youtuber on the planet grew by helping people and giving away money to people in need.  Just burn it, you're definitely not a piece of garbage.
Got what you wanted 😂
Mission accomplished🎉
This aged well
Uncle Ben said he really appreciated your help as an intern! I think you did a great job. Truly.
5 months later it lights on fire and blows up
Ferrari secretly showing customers your videos saying “see how reliable our cars are”
bros foreshadowing
He doesn't deserve anything! I hope he becomes homeless and hungry.
whos watching after it burned down
Fuck Ferrari. You buy it, you own it.
damn that F-cart is FIREEEEEEEEEEEEE
the end got me
Mission accomplished
4:38 💀💀💀💀💀💀
god there’s just so much foreshadowing
good job u destroyed it lol
Sorry for your loss.
this didnt age well
Only to have this moron burn it to the ground in the next video
Had to come back and watch this after the rari just burnt to crisps
that aged well
It's really hard watching this video...I wouldn't even do this to a 1995 Pontiac...a freaking f8... 🤢
RIP FERRARI
So what's the deal with all those hard cases?
Well hey, if it’s red it’s…uh…it’s dead
This aged well….
well its gone now
Well, I guess this title didn't age well
DONE 😂😂😂😂
Nice to watch this since it burned. 🔥
6:50 This aged well. I'm sorry for your loss Cody. Mostly for selfish reasons because I wanted you to piss more people off.
what a cool car, would be a shame if it catches fire 5 month after being bought
ironic title now huh
We need an American version of goodwood that's what you can do. I wish I was a part of it though obviously
A Koenigsegg is literally a crown Vic block beefed up to oblivion with a absolutely beautiful looking car. I would buy a Koenigsegg all day long
I watched your video of you burn this thing down and let me tell you something. I would buy nothing but a Koenigsegg if I had the money
What an absolute perfect example with that stupid ass purrrrrrari... That just goes to show you. You cannot trust your children around people like that. You just can't
Who's back here after the burn down????
That title of the video aged well for the wrong reason.
still dont know how someone is gonna get sued for drawing a dick on the ferrari emblem
Aaannnddd...its gone
Well in the climate we live in now. This hillbilly is wasting money on cars then destroying them. No brains. Thick as f@#k red neck. Retard!!!!! This is humans for you. Animals are so much smarter
Whos here after his ferrari caught fire?
Totally disgusting display of cluelessness.  Douchebag with money.
he really had fun with it lmao
Anyone here after this thing burned to a crisp?
yes you will burn it down eventually but u don’t know yet
he is so easy to hate
That red car comment aged perfectly!
noice
And now he burned it nice way to destroy it
Rip
Cody, you are YouTube… dope content! Your channel never disappoints.. Love it man!
@1:40 this didnt age well
I'm from the future... This doesn't end well.
Surely they will get a bunch of videos out before it, oh I don't know, burns down in a field.
And now it's burnt down
1:42 foreshadowing
1:43 he predicted the future!
well that escalated quickly 😂😂😂
And look at it now
Te lo compro por $10
I hate the fact you destroy cars instead of giving them away . Destroying a Ferrari or any luxury car is stupid
People dying because they cant aff9rd food and you destroy 400k, give it to People who need it
No way, he actually put nuts on the horsey LOL
Omish trick out that thang😂
I am more likely to buy a Ferrari after watching this... I am impressed and surprised at how capable the car is
8:15 it was all worth it to hear that thing echo through the valley like that.
literally what, "Fuck-you money" looks like.
10:07 this part made me so damn happy. Watching a Ferrari doing shit you would never expect it to do (or be done to it) is a fucking blast to watch
smile with pain
Oh, right… 14 minutes of “hey! ….yo! look at the size of my diiiiiiiiiiiiccccccckkkkkk”   But, I don’t know this cat… never mind.
tosser
You're my favorite person you remind me of my cousin Johnny
Could I get a liter of cola
Car ramrod
I have some ideas beautiful man in a non-gay way LOL
i want one too
I don't know why but from "so that's convenient" to "we have a lot of room here" made me laugh uncontrollably, for real.
okay. you had me smile and giggle through out the vid but when everyone was just throwing everything they could at the bubble I was cracking up. THANK YOU!!!! I'm dealing with chronic lymphoma  after a diagnosis of TERMINAL MELYNOMA  that I had to deal with a couple of years ago. You've made this day a little more enjoyable.... thanks.
Bro, Can you send this video over to Ferrari...😆😅🤣😂
Навищо Тоби Феррари,купи ЗАЗ Таврия
Hello Nick
Ferrari if u are watching this sue this asshole
Man is playing Forza in real life
Love that keep giving it to the man 😂
Real life Forza Horizon! Love it! #FukkFerrari
5:22 bro even got the cinematic shots
Bro can no longer buy a Ferrari 🗿 That's on you buddy
This video gives me Fast And Furious vibes
Prity durable
Nice
The lambo car cover 😂. Disrespect level 💯
actually i would love to try it when i'll afford it
As someone who doesn't smile often, let alone laugh...... This shit makes my cheeks hurt. #loveit
I guess kids like the thumbnail but it’s boring
Richest man In Indiana
This was so hard to watch
When it comes to offroad This guy >>>>> Andrew Tate
the ending killled me bruh
This kinda content just to prove something is wonderful. If i have the same money as you. I would crash it into civillians.
He literaly Play GTA in Real Life
13:20 everything but the kitchen sink. After the Ferrari is destroyed, you should ship it to the headquarters.
12:12 the Company who made this should use this as their advertising
"There's some very sensitive sensors on the front that can set off the airbags so we have to be careful"  *proceeds to ram through a closed gate*
At some point you just give into the madness and accept the car is gonna get fucked.
Why?
I not hew one dolars 😪dys guy destroit 400,000😪😪💔
That thing sounds amazing.
am i the only one that realized he is driving on a road with no licence plate?
I have to admit that years ago watching this guy it was jarring to say the least I would shake my head and think what a waste of machinery he should give it to someone who needs it wrecking stuff is like a crime but the more I've watched I love it I don't know why but I just enjoy it he is just fucking around not hurting anyone and machinery is just machinery in the end.  I have to say I'm in my mid 50's and its probably  sadder that I watch this sort of thing.
That’s actually hella impressive 😂😂. Ferrari needs to pay you for the durability testing
If anything i think this shows that ferrari should dive into the rally world this was sick!
Best add for Ferrari ever . This was really dope . This was what every boy did in video games
very entertaining show of idgaf
Bro can you give one ferrari seat to your favourite subscriber? I need to convert one to a office chair lol. Ill pay for shipping and all lol
I WONDER IF THE WARRANTY STILL VALID😂
😂😂😂😂 bunch of gaytalians crying here over a car they can't afford
That inflatable car cover held up surprisingly well. I was sure it would pop at some point but it managed to impress me
Whats all the boxes in the back there
im most impressed by the fact that he can keep a car with that much power in it on course for any substantial amount of time lol
Buy another Ferrari and put a lift kit and off road tires on it
I didn't see one single hammer..
Just got this upload in my notifications and it said 5hrs ago....i clicked and its the same one I've seen, i looked at date and it says 5months, which makes sense.
Actually, after my 2nd comment, I realized i was still super stoned😅😅 and...ya that Ferrari is a base model. Yes still Ferrari dont get me wrong! But at least it's a cheao model, not a 599 or something awesome. That Ferrari is more like the new corvettes 😂😂
Best unintentional ad for the car bubble ever!!!
1:13 deadmau5
I aint gonna lie that looked bad ass rolling the car of road like that
Danny duncan " yea lets set this 02 civic on fire"  DDE " yeah lets be a bit rough but take care of what we drive or atleast fix it" WhistlinDiesel" lets throw this $500,000 car off a cliff for one video" lmfao i love it
Ferrari should be paying you to do these videos.
I mean honestly I have a whole new respect for Ferrari,this sucker is doing all kinds of cool stuff without breaking If I Was A Millionaire I'd buy one just for that I mean I wouldn't treat it like that but I could be confident it would last if I chose to drive it everyday LOL by the way the Hillclimb was freaking amazing I can't believe it did that
I love this video!   I hope you fight them if they do sue you.
Omg 100 ads in a 6 minute video smh
Log pile test?
This is what first comes to my mind haha
Imagine buying a car and not being able to do what you want with it that's just stupid I'm surprised Ferrari hasn't went out of business tbh they make race cars literally and they want you to treat them like a rolls Royce which btw you can wrap with rainbows and cars it you wanted to
Enzo's turning in his grave...
we are so getting sued
they gave the logo a p*nis
This defo needs horse buggy wheels or monster truck tyres
my family says 2ws + speed = 4wd 🤷‍♂️
كثر مقاطع الفراري😂😂😂
U krazy
13:49 why did he add gunfire sounds into it
Can I have the Ferrari
Somebody said the 458 is a broke boy car, anyone that says that don't even have a car for sure
ma battona la madonna potrè fa ste mosse ta na machina del genere ma tu se n boccalone che scappa dal Tevere
Well now we know that bubble company is going to go out of stock
Hardly destroyed. Sweet video tho 🤘🏻🤘🏻
Lawsuit city. Theyre never gonna let you get another ferrari again lmao
@13:17 bruh! he asked for a hammer! yall could have hurt someone! Or worse, hurt that Ferrari!!!
Yo what are you doing to that poor car😭
dude is literally doing what i do in forza but in real life
I have a few those green cases he has from my time in the military. Good stuff. Water tight.
Ferrari: Whistlindiesel you are now part of our blacklist
Man I wish you did that last part without the bubble 😂
IRL Forza Horizon
Bro irl Forza
that must be a strong bubble if it can withstand the home depot bucket
He wastes his money just to make us entertained he works very hard I appreciate him so much
ferraris kill squad bouta pull up to his crib for ts
This video sold more of those bubble car wraps in 1 minute then anything else in the world
Yes why not grind metal next to a gas can
What is this, a paid Ferrari add? It's like you guys are trying to play it safe with Ferrari. Sand it down, paint it pink and ship it to Monio. Drive it around, then ship it to Rome, drive to around. I promise you will draw fire legally from Ferrari faster than throwing water bottles at it.
This guy's living his best life. I'm here for it 🤟🤟🤟
Ferrari: You can'tta notta do that! Mamma Mia!
Ha ha!!! F🖕ck you, Ferrari 😂😂😂😂
All these vehicles and equipment he purchases with his YouTube income, is all qualified business expenses and he can write almost all of the price off on his taxes. It's a genius loophole instead of giving the government a million for taxes on the income  you can write it off and use that money for more business expenses.. what a dream
You should buy a bugatti la voiture noire and destroy it
this video made me want to buy a Ferrari
try hooking a vacuum-pump to that inflatable shield thing instead and see if it can crush the car?
Hey man could you send me a suron to destroy or could you destroy one please
ferrari watching this video -      -__-
bro is playing bmg drive in real life
13:42 pick that shit up it’s time to go
this...is...so..stupid
degeneration next level
He has like half a million likes and positive feedback, but chooses to focus on 1 hater with 2 likes. Focus on the ones that keep you here, haters just means success
I think this guy is on Ferrari's blackest list 😂
4:12 THAT C63 THO 🇩🇪
@4:41 disappointed dad face.  But that mustache is glorious
Natural male instinct upon receiving a writing tool
Fun fact: The F40 was originally developed from an idea by Mechanical Engineer Materazzi of using the Group B 4-litre category (2.8-litre if turbocharged) to prove the performance of new road cars, but group B was ended before they were rostered.    The layout of modern Ferraris partially follows that lineage, structure and design
https://youtu.be/zAUAcILiOYE   amazing way
If I can afford to drive a Ferrari like that believe me Im gonna do it over and over and over again 😂
if anything this was a durability commercial for ferrari
Cara sou pobre me manda um dinheiro em vez de fazer n tenho casa própria dá uma força já que se faz isso com carro de luxo 😅🤣🤣
Bro thinks he's in forza horizon 5
Clutch has seen better days

Your awful, you waste so many resources. You do nothing but take from society
Dude is playing forza in real life. 😂 see you can rally a Ferrari!
This is just Forza Horizon 5 in real life.
posts it at the marketplace: *lady owned*
This hurts a little bit... but i am smiling! very entertaining i guess 😂😂
Money can't buy happiness well I don't think so 😏
Ferrari should pay him for showing everyone how durable and offroad capable its cars are.
bro actually plays gta in real life
🤣
How cool is it to be able to buy expensive cars just to destroy them. There's people living in poverty that can't afford food. Damn.

The proof that in breeding is a bad idea!
This is how gta characters actually use their supercars😂
I like how there are just dozens of toyotas laying around on his drive way.
YouTubers customizing hot wheels:

I am kind of feeling Ferrari themselves never tried that because they were too scared lmao
This is like in forza horizon when you decide to go off roading in a super car

I'm italian and i love Ferrari
Spoiled white boys. Smfh
Bro drove like he was in Forza Horizon 💀
Race that thing at Freedom Factory
@WhistlinDiesel buy my truck so I don’t screw my credit and total it out for me please!🤣🤣🤟🏻
First world after I hear Ferrari is trash
Whyyyy whyyyy😭
I wouldn't technacly do what he did to that that ferarri. I own an sf90 but i never abuse it like this. I mean it is good for content but if you get a letter i mean you know why
No way this is real!
God that things sounds amazing
As a Lamborghini fan it was still painful to watch this
It’s funny how I’ve been in that exact same spot in that exact same garage multiple times. Pretty cool to think about.
WhistlinDiesel: for a 2wd car this would kill you. Me knowing dang well that a 2nd gen dodge viper would kill you if you made the engine to hot or you forgot there was no traction control
DON' T WASTE FERRARIES😢
He's dressed like a gta player driving a super car like you would drive a super car in gta
Well done soldier 🗿🪖... Ur an inspiration to the future generation.
So.. how does he afford this??
4:44 Toyota Supra on jack💀💀💀
KILL THAT THING BRO HELL YEAH. FORD4EVER
This hurt to watch
watching italian trash being treated as such is so… refreshing
Best car❤
Irl gta
So sad 😢
The end was f@cking FUNNY‼️🤣👍🏼
Bro threw so much lol
Lol crap
Hey man you don't want to be like me You buy a fancy car and taunt everyone Oh dear, it's crazy, all these poor people Who just earns 1000 dollars a month It's really ridiculous not like you and me bah ah ah ah ah ah ah XDDD
Imagine ferrari making a rally version of the F8 to compete with the offroad Huracan
Me in GTAV
You should have thrown the kitchen sink at it!
Me playing forza
New mr beast
A 400000 $ ferrari getting destroyed and its a dream for me to buy a 3000$ bike 😢
@artioli me trouxe aqui.
This guy's is mocking everybody who watches this video. Audaciously driving a car we will never own and desecrating it right I front of us all while making money to fund his next purchase.
Please, don't use God's name in vain!
How to get BANNED by ferrari hahaha
Destroy it
HEY YOU STILL HAVEN'T DESTROYED THE FERRARI
my face was just smiling throughout the entire video
Idiot
Class action lawsuit
Covering a ferrari in lambhourgini cover? You are blacklisted from new cars for life
This dude puts money down crazy, I’m still trying to figure out how I’m going to feed my family until next payday,, unreal man
rep ferrari
Unspeakable want you to cut his 141 pound cube
I feel so sorry for Ferrari
You all ways make me laugh
Let me fix this clickbait which is really good btw #madrespect. I bought a 400,000 Ferrari just to f with it a bit and then either keep it because it was a lot of fun or clean it up a bit and sell it covering any losses with youtube revenue. Yeah it's a long title but let's be real.
Chase !!!!!'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
MAD😢😮Rich👹🤬👺😡💩👍
So you didnt destroy it((( just a rough test
😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭
Ferrari?!, The only car i break was my lego car😭😭
idk about suing but this is one helluva good ad for ferraris offroad capabilities
what type of animal threw that tire ???
“We do not care” XD😂😂😂
Happy Birthday
that moment when he said '' give me a hammer'' hahah
Must be nice to be able to do things like this man, I am jealous. My car is currently in the shop and I’m buried so deep in bills I have no clue how I’m going to pay for the work it needs done. Love your vids man keep making the content we all wish we could make as well
Should have destroyed it more than the Hilux
@ferrari call the police for this guy RIGHT NOW
Bro has Way to much money
Disappointed at how long it’s been since this video that we haven’t gotten to see more Ferrari destruction…
Tu é foda menor
bruh the scrathing noises with 100% headphones left me deaf 4:25
Please give us an update! Im desperate to know if Ferrari ever contacted you or if any problems or response have gotten to you by them.🫨🫨
Mercedes Paulman durability test is next up.
And you prove how idiot you are! Next time maybe you help someone that needs those money!
Where is he getting all this money from?  Most of us dream of affording such a vehicle. But this man uses it as toilet paper
better option then destroying is to give ferarii to me lol
I love the Streisand Effect
2:02 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Him destroying cars, me who’s trying get my first car 😭
You should get the maurader
Who else is super impressed with the inflatable car cover??? 😲  I thought it was going to pop with the first screwdriver!
Players on forza horizon
This is nice.... can i just have some sparco sites to my old vw gol?
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee E E E  Ee E E E E E EEe E E  E
I hate you
I mean ferrari can't sue you for saying they sue everyone because if they sue you they prove you right. Checkamte, ferrari.
Welcome to : How to promote products without promoting products !
did you get sued?
And this is a pure example of why the internet shouldn’t turn losers into millionaires…how inspirational is this video of a guy destroying a vehicle 99% of us could never afford to own….pathetic not just the content creator but you lot for supporting this and making these morons rich & famous 🙄🤬
NOT THE PORCHES 911 AT THE START
Man ur crazy!!🤯
you don't care about your cars
A única vez q vi um carro desses  sendo destruído assim foi no velozes e furiososkkk
Hf7tfhj🇺🇸🇺🇸🖕💩🤢🤮🇮🇱
😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅😅😅
😢xgx
But it's not destroyed 👎
im more interested in the car cover than the car
love ur vids from Philippines so many  wasted cars can u send to my country 1 any of that car survived haha I really want to have a car haha
He's living in gta
Did anyone see the supra when he said he’s gonna rip the stock exhaust of the Ferrari in the back
What’s the link for one of those car bubbles lol
How many gates has this guy gone through
I love how he makes all this happen  for us
This is my all time favorite film ever. I'm Craig White 100474.  Because Wes Watson said if you had to be a car what would it be he has a ton of them.  Whistling Diesel you do too but usually not for long or then again there's Monster Max 2. Initially I came to my own conclusion the Hot Rod Funny car something mentioned in Ross Jefferies mindset tapes. But moreso I was a boy who'd go lorry driving with an Uncle while he was picking up I'd stay in the guards booth one day a dude gave me a price if Onyx stone and a couple Hot Rod mags American Trucks too. These fascinated me just because they were looking cool like Commando Arnold Schwarzenegger at that time.  Now I realize I'm really a Ferrari Whistling Diesel you saved my soul. I love you bro. From Craig. GB. Warmest regards to your wife. Thanks for the films. Oh Thanks for my hoodie. I thought I didn't get the chip. But I did:)
ignorance at its beautifullest fit. there is people in your country who dont have what to eat tonight and others have cancer..
I need a jeep so bad..
ferrari did do rally and wrc in the late 70s early 80s, fastest way to get a cease and desist with this would be turn it into a rally car, that would really piss them off
Bro's basically got a rally style race track in his backyard
4.20 behind
4:18 Toyota supra☠☠
Why do these videos make more sense the more drunk I am..?
Sick with it best videos ever made 😅😊😂
Tesla roadster I think it would be great if you did.😂
I literally could not take a breath or close my mouth during most of this video!
the DEFINITION OF THINGS YOU OWN DOESNT OWN YOU THAT HOW EVERYONE SHOULD LIVE
MORE MONSTERMAX!!! MORE MONSTERMAX!!!
MORE MONSTERMAX!!! MORE MONSTERMAX!!!
MORE MONSTERMAX!!! MORE MONSTERMAX!!!
Why. Just why
This honestly was very enjoyable to watch coming from someone that usually doesn't like the videos, enough disrespect and recklessness without having to squish the car into a cube or cut it in half. Plus it's a very replaceable car, doesn't matter.
did u got any letters from Ferrari?
Keep it up brother, your vids are the shit 😂👌🏻
i swear ferrari is gunna sew the guy who crashed it , even if hes dead
Okay.... fuuuuck Ferrari hahahahahahahahah. Seriously??? Sell a $400,000+ car and provide 38 cent gloves with thier logo on em? Get fuuuucked
Nice lambo 👍🏽
Need for speed hot pursuit
ondra chce znát tvojí polohu
WOW 🤯
No es que tenga algo contra Ferrari o no, sino que hacer un vídeo así es solo porque quiere likes. Cuanto más loco es un vídeo, más repercusión tiene, pero en este caso, es que solo es un personaje destrozando un coche (que me da igual la marca), a cambio de visualizaciones. Tampoco es cuestión de si tengo o no dinero para comprarlo (spoiler, no lo tengo), sino que que gana alguien haciendo estás "pruebas"? Yo creo que tiene un problema mental de que le gusta llamar la atención o algo así. Eso es altamente peligroso porque son capaces de hacer cualquier cosa, solo espero que no se lleve a nadie por delante y se medique cuanto antes. Igual quitarle el carnet de conducir de por vida, es otra solución
I mean so far he’s made this thing look like its well build
Any word from Ferrari yet? Lol
thank you for doing this, i hate ferrari, ferraris or not powerfull and thay or ugly, lamborghini is grate of you want a nice car get your self a lamborghini
Gol foge
Vc e o cara
How do you have this much money
I’m in between where I love it and hate it bc it’s $400k and I could use that
so happy he didnt break it
The air bag edit killed me i gotta quit smokin and hitting YouTube
Bro treating this like Forza 4
imo if its used and you buy it from a normal person you should be able to do w.e you want with it
Where's the rest of this destroyed car
Cringe.
Ferrari’s are just a slightly tuned Subaru Impreza change my mind
3:19 Doug jumpscare
7:58 me in fh5 taking the shortcut
13:59  i love this
As a german this is the most american Thing i have seen in a while the whole Video is missing one Song 😂 https://youtu.be/MhQ5678cJU8
Ferrari fans may not like this, but Ferrari's are one of the most unreliable super cars ever made. They're well known for being very unreliable, even just driving them normally
Vhere did you learn to drive
Wtaching this hurts
Definitely a cleannn rally car
my pain is indescribable
Ferrari is like the Nintendo of cars.
μπράβο λεβεντοτσουτσουνε είσαι άντρας
This kid is my long lost brother with the type of money I would play with exactly like he does living to the fullest as God intended
Bro ur wasting moneys 💀💀💀
Ferrari: persona non grata
Why do they need so many ladders 😂😂😂
YouTube traduz aí para o português
i think destruction when he say ferrari
Questo è il tipico video che rappresenta il livello di idiozia che ha raggiunto il genere umano. Ma non mi preoccupo tanto per i contenuti che produce ma per tutti coloro che si pappano avidamente questa feccia a bocca aperta
Now that we know it can be done we need to see a ferrari in the next WRC game
The only real way to treat a Ferrari.
3:49 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
W camera man🤣
Why does he remind me of homelander
Whistlindiesel vs mr beast who wins
WhistlinDiesel Why U Crash SuperCars:(
This is so dumb what you are doin
Can i have the ferrari?

Only whistilndiesel can make you laugh from a car getting butchered
ngl, the f8 tributo is my favourite car right now, and this hurts my soul to watch
forza horizon 5 in real life  👍
LOL
Fuck
Forza Horizon))))
Ferrari Roasted by Lamborghini Huracan Car Cover 😂😂😂😂
POV: Forza Horizon
__idk how the company allow him to do this
Enzo Ferrari started to produce and sell cars to rich people, just to earn the money he needed to race! Rich companies, as Ford, just made and sell economic cars for poor people and spent lot lot lot lot of money to race (more then Ferrari), just to sell more economic cars to poor people. When you see a Ferrari, you are watching the wish to race, the passion for race! When you see a Ford, it's just business. As your videos are just business, not passion.
bolt guns to it!!!
It come with a factory skid plate.        Must be fore rock crawling 😂😂😂😂
It sounds so good
Did you get sued yet
what type of ferrrari is this?
bro has a supra in the back💀💀
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱🤯🤯

Alguém do Brasil tá vendo esse vídeo
Are all those cars in the beginning his?
You do not deserve this car masterpiece.
My name is keller 0:07
I'll take it if you are done with it.
This is probably the sickest thing you would do with a car like this.
how much for rc truck
Ferrari: We will never again sell to WD.
bro does irl what i do in forza😂😂😂
i hope they sue you
You are a really good driver indeed!
most insane video of the millenfdfksfhkrium
Lucas would be mad if he saw this whistlindiesel I’m just saying bro😊
i was expecting ferrari official to be making a comment
No not the Ferrari
Sos
der falsche wurde reich gemacht
My mans in playground mode😂
Keep destroying cars kinda love it
He’s gonna get banned from Ferrari lmfao
idiot
Idiota
i was really disappointed that the car was still intact at the end of this video i came to see it destroyed the video was a total click bait
You should buy a steam locomotive
Bro that drift was smooth
What am i expecting: A bunch of retards ruining a beautiful car What i got: A car review/Stress test more competent and entertaining than the so-called "professional reviewers"
Did you get sued after this video, coz you literally destroyed the ferrari
The lamborghini cover 💀
I just recently found this kid, and he’s got about the most entertaining channel on YouTube. He has tons of subs too. Not sure how I missed out for so long
Bro is banned from Ferrari
Ferrari be like : Our lawyers will be contacting you soon
😂😂😂
That lacks much destruction
he's playing gta irl.
pov:car in forza horizon 5
13:16 glad that he didn't ask for a machete
IDIOT🦍🎃🐛🐖😡
This video was just made to anger people
He is so smart☺️
12:40 what about a person.
Perfect video absolutely love it
, .
12 dollars Nah more like 11      Thousand 😂
literally forza horizon irl
Can I have it😂
No ones gunna talk about the supra in the backround at 4:19
A love the fact that you just don't even care what you do to things. what many people could only dream of owning😂😂
This made me suicidal.
Nice Video! Next time please make a " I bought a $300.000 Ferrari just to gift it to kuzeykb". I guarantee you that you will get over 50M views by doing this! 😄
Even better if Ferrari suit #Youtube with you because it's dangerous, what you do it's their fault. Contents like this goes around and they are the ones who pay you. Maybe is time tk take down youtube a notch 🤗😎
Bro’s playing forza horizon irl
If you don't like it give it to the poor instead of destroying it.
Nul de faire ça sa fait mal au cœur de voir une si belle voiture être utilisée comme ça
13:19 Me when start spawning items in Garry's mod XDDDD
You took a big risk with the hammer stunt. The hammer could've hit you as it bounced off the balloon.
This looks like a ferrari sponsored video.
You are like a two year old playing with cars… Oh sorry, you ARE a two year old, A HUGE 👎
Well done bro
Hes playing NFS in real life
Ferrari is not happy
this hurts.
tottaly getting sued
Andrew tate ain't got nothing on you
I wonder what is this dudes car.. ( like his actual car he uses for everything )
Bro gonna be selling this like: "low mileage, lightly used!"🤣
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bro I love the video's
Bro why are wasting cars plus give me
This the kind of shit you normally only see in forza
bro is playing gta irl
What a sick man
Bros playing forza horizon in real life😂
Ferrari wants to know your location
4:44 Dude didn’t know what the fuck to do
7:14 average forza horizon player when they buy a supercar:
cant lie im deff being this ignorant in the whip
Bros playing forza irl
Do a durability test on your CAT 336
He fulfilled my dream of being a Forza Horizon player in real life.
la mamma degli scemi è sempre pregna...
People dream about a car like this and you break kt infront of it mannn im not akaren okay just keep your car as a colection😅😊
Man you kill me sometimes brother...but hey you got it$$$ like that so fuck it ...but my feel bads are hurt 😂😂😂 such a bad ass fast ass car...
Ferrari seems to be the Nintendo of the car world
4:12 That's insane. When you pay $400,000 for a car you should be able to whatever you want with it. Reminds me of the one that isn't road legal so you have to arrange to meet Ferrari at a track and are not allowed to take the car home with you.
9:40 goes forza horizon 4 mode
This video was 100% clickbait
did you ceramic coat it or apply PPF?!
This is one of WD's better vids. Jay Leno somewhat famously refuses to buy Ferraris and there is a good reason for it. The company is run by assholes and they treat owners like shit.
Random gunshots during bubble test is the best
i feel like they made the suv after this video, you need some royalties
Gift me a car please 🙃
This is ridiculous some people only have 400 thousand dollars and they just destroy it
Tinha que ser em português também. 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
This guy will live to be 150 years old. Stress kills a lot of people, but as world record holder of “idntgiveafk”, he has no stress. Live long and trash lots ofShit brother✌🏼
bro the children in africa couldve ate that
Pov: what your dad think you do when u ask him to borrow your ferrari.
If anything Ferrari should use this during their sales pitch, like "listen, let me show you something" and then just put this video on. "See how long WhistlinDiesel had it for and it still works"
Good job cleaning your Ferrari 😂
No, he needs to put a honda civic motor in it, no exhaust, put a giant wing on the back , put a crappy paint job, then drive it like a teenager
You are a big garbge...
ive watched this 4 times going on 5. never gets old😂❤
Dam bro love the videos I take donations!
who gave u your license
this is a wast it will take forever for him to get his money back from youtube.
how ur suppoed to used a car
That he'll look pretty good in the mud
Ferrari would like to know your location
13:33 Tom and Jerry off camera fight scenes
Bro, I never wanted a Ferrari until I saw this video. I figured they would be like my Ye Olde Jag and break every couple of miles...
I don’t understand this …
Cody, please repeat the scene from F&F2 where the R34 Skyline jumps over the bridge, it will be a legendary clip on the Internet
tosser
i want a rollce royce test
You always make me laugh
the ending is the best
yo whistlin can I have the indicator handle button on the end?
He's playing froza horizon in real life 😂
Love 3:14
Ferrari is probably commenting on this video asking a million questions why your doing this
Why would you destroy that car when you can buy cheaper ones to give them for charity
Bro is literally  me in Forza
I love your videos 😊
This video is evry sports car in gta 5
That's what enzo Rarri wants
I can't
SOME SEE THE CAR THAT IS UPSIDE THE RED CAR THAT HAD 2 WHITE STRIP 4:44    YESSSS    ITS    SUPRAAAAAAAA
sad
Best advert for a car bubble ever seen
Ferarri doesn’t care that he destroyed one of their cars purposely and Deadmau5 gets a cease and desist letter from them because he wrapped one.
bdhsgfhsd
Ferrari is lucky that he used a bubble like cove and not a normal one or eles Meanwhile ferrari :- 😵😵😵😵😵
Wish i had his money dam 😂
woder why dro is stupid
No body that worked for that money and had no help from the beginning would blow money so carelessly, plus there is plenty of good people he probably knows that he couldmake  a difference if he wanted to with that money and no not just giving it away to people that would blow it on bad decisions, but still fun to watch, but u cant blow money if u worked urentire life for success,
this guy showed  up that the ferrari is a great rally car
Now this is how to drive a Ferrari! Respect to you for showing the real way to use a Ferrari
I mean. I drive ferrari on forza horizon 4. I flipped it, make big jumps, crash. With that said. What this guy did was the right thing.
straight out of forza
Best Ferarri ad ever
Bruh that so dum
*ferrari wants to know you location*      (idk if someone has said it already or not but im gonna say it anyways)
Idiots when is waisting time money and human resources doing stupid dumb shit gonna stop equaling money gain off the internet some of your stuff was cool now your just a bunch of Idiots starved for more views
My man driving that car like he's on Forza horizon
This video Literally describes every forza horizon player ever
Hi , new to the channel and from france , question is : can i have a part of the ferrari ? 😂👍
FUCKING SUCKER YOU DID NOT EVEN DESTROY IT  THE TOTAL DMG COULD BE WORTH LIKE ONLY 50K MAYBE EVNE LESS WHICH IS NOTHING CAR IS STILL BRAND NEW FUCKING SUCKER FUCKING CLICKBAIT TITLE
How does this work?  for a video that has 11M views, does he make a profit on this?  How much does one make on youtube videos?  I've seen this guy before.  He comes across a little fratboy douchey but he's making shitloads of money!  Good for him!  Unless he was just rich to begin with.
why is the plate in the start Danish?
Ferrari had been quiet since this realeased
HELP!!!!!! I bought a car from Smith Chevrolet In Idaho falls,Idaho, and after only 2 months it's throwing a rod and the car lot just doesn't care,I'm so hurt if you can please leave them a 1 star review and put I support Sezz ,maybe if their review gets lowered they will talk it over with me I still owe $4000 and they just don't care,God bless you all
0:41 Why he using a Hurucan EVO tarpaulin
Bro thanks Its Forza
Mouth breathers shouldn't breed.
I wish more people would do this. If I buy a car it belongs to me, they can kiss my ass what I do with it.  😅
bro why
Ferrari watching this 👁️👄👁️
I think I heard him say “ give me A hammer” not everything!
Just another idiot........................
Ferrari will add you to the blacklist as soon as possible
GTA 6 leaked gameplay
ma quale gusto hai di rompere un macchina sopratutto una ferrarri ma poi quelli so cazzi tua perchè i soldi ce li spendi tu però non mi sembra giusto sputare ho disegnare su un logo ferrari solo perchè noi italiani facciamo le macchine migliori delle vostre e sopratutto che stanno sulla strada non che se accelleri vai a sbattere perchè non hanno tenuta ma veramente volete mettere a confronto una macchina come la ferrari con una mustang o con una corvette vabbè che di intelligenza ce ne è poca nei vostri cervelli però un minimo si pensava che la avevate a deficienti sembrate potti de du anni cretini vi sentite grandi come persone solo perchè avete i soldi avere soldi non significa essere grandi ci sono tante persone che hanno i soldi come voi e  sono stupidi un esempio siete voi
he is playing GTA 5 online in Real life
13:19 was like watching a cartoon😅
Be careful though , Ferrari might send their John Wick to pick you up for destroying their raaaaaaari
Dude you are crazy, that was just 🧨🔥🔥🔥
Not gonna lie but if I had money this is the least that I would do to it :D
Welcome to the gul...ehm...WELCOME TO FERRARI BLACK LIST.
can we get a pt two some day
Arazi için fazla sağlammış. Şaşırdım. Hakikaten kaliteli. Fazla hem de.
Neden la emek ve kaynak düşmanı? Neden?
this guy is playing gta in real life.
Guys i saw his supra
bro this is not forza lol
I'd be more impressed if you built a 400,000.00  shelter for runaway kids or something than running around giggling like a gay school kid over blowing on bullshit.
you sold me on that bubble. holy shit it really does work.
Ferrari is a good car
This is the first time I see anyone on earth enjoying a Ferrari, also despite how crazy this man is he can actually drive pretty good
No kitchen sink?  You guys missed out.
I laughed, I smiled, I cried, then laughed at myself!
This is hilarious! Love it!
can you make a video without the protection bubble throwing things on that ferrari to see the difference? 🤔
“What is the first word that comes to your mind when I say Ferrari?” Incompetence, look at their f1 team currently.
He could use this for a movie
The amount of shit your guys threw at this car is hilarious!!!
But you didn’t destroy it :(
It just hurts to watch this  🥲
You need bail money? I will help
bro is playing forza in real life   he does not know that there in no revers button
Konten yg teramat amat bodoh
"money does not make happiness"
Due decerebrati! A guardare ste cose mi sale il crimine!
ой знали б люди що це розвага не людей)) а власників світу)))
13:16 "give me a hammer" Porceeds to throw the entire fucking garage
Some people should never be rich
Try modifying it into a offroad sport car
Can we all acknowledge that Cody can drive not how the rest of us can. This man can drive
Bro needs a Huracan Sterrato or one of them porsche 911 dakar lmao
Reminds me of the so-called "loan car" that Courtesy Pontiac provided to me back in the late 90's. I drove it to Lake Havasu, AZ.... and drove it INTO said lake like a half dozen times. Geo Metro 3-cylinder, 3-door hatchback. Drove back to Las Vegas...hit every mile marker on the way...and returned to the dealership to get my Bonneville SSEI back. The somewhat bewildered service manager told me I would never get service there again...to which I responded " Sure... that's because I will never bring my car to you for service again. The hilarious part is that there was mud flying off it...and DEAD FISH falling from it. ALWAYS fully insure the P.O.S. loan ar... 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Åsna är en åsna
You should of threw a honking chicken at the car that would of been funny
Why my guy?😒😦😣🤬
forza in real life:
You are a fucking tool but one that works much harder than me.
this hurts to watch
THANK YOU for this video. Ferrari got what it deserved. 🙏
3:47 pov me when I'm bored in class
My man is like "We Do Not Care"
Honestly, i kinda love seeing a Ferrari roughed up like this. most are just garage queens and kept pristine (which I get, they're magical vehicles!) but videos like this show us what they can really do and how good the build quality still is
DARE: get it stuck😊
So punk man yeah absolutely crazy millionaire destroying expensive toys. What a guy. Amazing stunning and brave
he play GTA  5 in ream life 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Wow. You bought a $400.000 ferrari and you destroyed it? Congratz bro
your a disgrace to ITALY
/////////////////////
this video hurt my soul
13:20 this is similar to what I watched with tossing everything
8:05 , 10:10 That baritone as it comes up that hill is so sweet. That's how Ferrari should have made it sound from the factory.
My name is boone
That's one expensive 4 wheeler
This is the most painful video on YouTube
Soooooo.....DID FERRARI SUE HIM?!?!
What a wast of money 🤡
yo can i let u destroy my sxt challenger in whatever way u want and then u buy me a lexus LC 500?
I’m Italian …and this is my face 😭😭
I both love and hate this video.
Bro drives cars like he's playing GTA
Why are there 2 police officers from the Netherlands at a destroyed car at 1:45
Imagine Ferrari commented here ...
You need to do a collab with Ricky Berwick... Imagine his laugh when you destroy something.  😂
What were the error codes tho? Cooling insufficient, airduct full of mud?
lol
No more ferraris for you
This hurt
Bro is gonna be band from whole italy not only ferrari
“We didn’t put google eyes on the horsey”
Ахуеть 😮
bro playin' forza
me on forza
Give money to the homeless
na the part where they throw random shit at the car got me lol
That Ferrari costs more than my 376,000 dollar house
You should've ended with dropping a large safe on it.
these guys have no respect for things... why pointlessly hit and destroy things? i get it its your money and you earn more but go live by yourself and lets see how long you survive growing your own food and if you will waste it then.. especially if you start forging metals and start building cars yourself i guarantee you will NOT do anything you do here. this is the difference between reality and just straight up stupidity. better off driving it like its meant to and accidentally crashing it.
you are a spoiled POS.
This car deserves to become a rally ing beast
We all have a ADHD friend like WhistlinDiesel, except not as rich lol
There's something wrong with this vid. How does one blast through a gate and the car doesn't take any damage? Where's the footage of destroying it with a backhoe like the Model T ??? LOL!
Imagine that 😂😂
Damn, forza in real life.
Bro just created the best possible ad for that car bubble company
Forza in rl
Why not do something constructive with the money, rather than hunt for pointless clicks?
I have biology exam tomorrow. *WATCHING A DUDE PLAY FORZA IRL*
Dude how many ladders does one person need
Bro you are so fake :) THIS IS SPECIAL FOR you ned if you want cant report my  _)_ .. !!
Décadence humaine de sépulcres blancs.
dude playing forza horizon irl
love how careful you are with you brand new ferrari
I wonder if this guy won the one billion powerball or something
this was honestly just 2 very amazing commercials in one. the first being the amazing new off-road Ferrari then that cool indestructible air bubble for your car. this is how you do grassroot advertising
Wow🥲
The ending is hilarious
This man lives the Forza Horizon life
Seriously?
I love this guy, he just dont 😂
Не показывайте это видео плохому парню
a crutch?!?
Ok, where's the rest of it ?
This guys driving is the definition of me playing gta 5 as a kid
awesome video , made me sub to your channel , seeing super cars being used like this is a different pleasant feeling
Lambo Cover on a Ferrari 💀
f the ferrari there is an mk4 supra in in the background
I just got to watch, real life gta, real life forza, and everything i could ever imagine in one video lmfaoo
Justin beiber watched this video with his teeth gritted.
bro fr just made the best ad for ferarri
bro just give me the ferrari instead of destryoing it🤔
that is absolutely frkng cool!!!!
you are better at drifting then ken block
I was waiting for you to throw the kitchen sink at it but I guess that kind of would have been obvious I like that I like that
WHERE DESTROY??? DISLIKE!!!
So we have Beavis and Butthead with too much money. Now first off, I have no problem with anyone owning a Ferrari. I've owned one and would love to own another.   What is pretty insulting here is showing people that you have somehow managed to accumulate enough money to take something beautiful and expensive out and mistreat it in order to flaunt your wealth.   At a time when hunger and homelessness are at record highs and a significant percentage of Americans are forced to choose between basic Healthcare and keeping a roof over their heads, displays of wealth and privilege like this  video are pretty tasteless and crass.  If you want to show off your Ferrari, or any of you're other expensive toys, just go ahead and point out it's features, technology or just it's beauty, but maybe just treat people and things with the respect that they deserve.
not only is Ferrari owned by Fiat nowadays (so let's all just call it by it's real name) but Koenigsegg is made IN sweden, the italian car IN italy, and since you can't eat this car it doesn't suprise me they are kind of shitely produced. Ferrari is made according to italian standards and Koenigsegg according to theirs 🤭 (NO WHOOPSEES HERE) let's just say STARK difference which nobody expected right?
A Ferrari tho? This was kinda hard to watch but it was fine after a while ahahah
Give me some ordinary car, if you don't even feel sorry for a Ferrari.
bro is in GTA V
Oh I loved this video!!! My face was tired by the end because of all the grinning I was doing!!!
BROOOO! I love it
respect the car and the brand, when you don't like it don't drive it. shame on you.
Fucking idiot!! Not to crash Ferrari, that is an art opera though, because you can give this money to someone need it...fucking asshole!!!
Ferrari should have bought that Lamborghini clutch.
How can I get wealthy enough to trash $400K cars? LOL! Where is the money coming from???
I hate Ferrari as a company so this video made my day
Bro  Ferrari is coming after you man
il be totally fair here, it is funny to see limits being pushed, and things we wish we could afford but never could be displayed.  And at the same time I'm thinking, gosh if i had one i would be so careful with it. But that's only because i would only ever have 1 if ever.  also its crazy to see that the ferarri is so good offroad
Am I missing something? He didn't destroy it at all - he just drove it in some gravel. The car looked completely in tact at the end
Daddys money
you're not welcome in italy !
@ferrari
dude... u did a free add for that bubble thing...
Hard to watch...
how dare you 😢
YES! I always wanted a video like this! THANK YOU!!! Your Lack of concern made me cry with joy! Thank you! Are you cool, and rich enough to own one of these, Well yes i am not watch my DESTROY IT in front of your very eyes!!!! MUAHAHAHAHAHA
average forza player in an actual supercar
Ora capisci perché per noi europei voi siete un popolo di ritardati?
bros playing gta 5 ☠☠
This looks like how the joker would treat his car. “Do I look like a man with a plan?” Pure Anarchy.
the 4th photo of the crashed ferrari is a photo from the netherlands
Shoot it with 50 bmg
False advertising 😡 title is clickbait.  You'll be hearing from my lawyer 🧐
throw bull horns on it wrap it hot pink and drive it thru italy
You just made me to want a Ferrari. Good car review😂😂😂
Whats in all those crates ??
The best anti-ferrari video I ever seen! 🔥  deadmau5 no.2
Pls don't
This guy is playing Forza Horizon in real life
I think this man started playing Forza horizon 3
advise use 98K   in video end..
WTF i can but drive in Forza..
7:07  I wonder why you don't see Ferraris in rally racing?  With different tires and a bit more ground clearance, it seems like they would do well!
Honestly, I respect the fact that a Ferrari is being used to it's full extent, it's a good car it SHOULD put to it's limits because you paid for the car, you better use it
all you do is break good things
This while video was just forza horizon 5 with rtx on 💀
i love this too much
Respect +
I literally said lawsuit as soon as you did
Hey sobhi001 where is your ferrari at little boy.
Im not bothered by how he spent his money. It just hurt to see that car be destroyed 😂
Top idiot ever!
at that point hes jujst playing forza horizon in real life
Going through the gates of his property is the same as entering GTA V universe.
Congratulations! This is your first and last brand new Ferrari
money’s dad
This feels so wrong but I can’t stop watching
Bro drove the farreri like in forza horizon
... and for my next trick I am going to set this dump truck full of one hundred dollar bills on fire and roll it off a cliff? Jesus kid... It is crazy but looks like fun. Lol.
i done the same. (in GTA)
Didn't destroy it
Appearing in Ed Bolians garage when?
Fuck Ferrari just get a Corvette a muscle car modded abit or supra.
shens ojaxshi viare shishvelma da davtyani yvela kabiani!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ferrari should be hiring this man for durability testing.

What's up with all of the green and tan cases behind the Ferrari in the shop???
If it’s red it’s dead
paddle tires on sand
@ferrari
Gta in real life
Why is he a army guy now
13:38 food fights be like
gta real life
THIS IS A HUGE LEVEL UP FOR FERRARI'S MARKETING
Smh...just a pos youtuber to put out something like this.
Now this.....this is how you drive a ferrari! Horses are made for the open fields baby!
se fosse stato vivo il Vecchio Ferrari non te l'avrebbe venduta

I would have loved to see ya put some good off road tires on that thing.
It needs big ass black dildo permanently attached to the front hood!
Forza Horizon 5 irl
another man on blacklist  of ferrari
there are 2 kinds of WD destruction videos. boringly and childishly smashing it to bits with other pieces of equipment (like the Model T video)...  then the really epic videos of pushing a vehicle to its limits by actually driving it, ripping it like he stole it and not backing down from high speeds on rough terrain. it's like GTA or how we used to play with toy cars as kids  i really want to see more like this.
Reading the comments of all the people offended is funny. It’s his money, if you don’t like what he produces then unsubscribe. Keep up the good work Cody!!
13:37 but the Kitchen sink
9:35 11:15 LOL
Does anyone know where I can get crates like those on the wall? Are they ammunition? I can find old ones like WWII but not those specific kind.
my question is do you know haw to act in a 67 shellby gt 500? if you know what i mean and I a'm a boy.
my idol
7:31 That was hilarious 😂😂😂
You should def pave your driveway
Un manque cruel de respect pour les ouvriers ayant confectionné ce véhicule  Juste pour finir, vous êtes un abruti.-
Idon't find a real purpose of these videos.... you bought  an expensive  car to damage it, which is the sense and the fun for that? Perhaps maybe my fault but i have fun playing with my cat or driving my cooper s enjoyning the performances leaving it intact
This man should go to a country where 1 dollar is rich and learn life
Wait so your telling me you just clickbated? You didn't destroy it
Pošalji meni 1000$ da kupim auto. Ne treba više, a neću se bunit ako i više pošalješ. Hvala unaprijed.
Bro drives like he could respawn
Very stupid video, not funny, not good content, first and last time I watch that
Why bro, whyyyyyy!!!???
This is the logical follow-up to Bam Margera putting a sunroof in his Lambo way back in like 2005
latest supra now
forza real life
honestly im more impressed with the sheer amount of ladders this guy owns
You are absolutely the best person to test anything with a motor
Can you send me a mini china truck
You are a sick asshole! 'Don't recomment channel'
Watching the ferrari do dounts drifting and offroading was one of the most beautifull things i have ever seen.
NON DISTRUGGETE MAI PIU' LE MACCHINE SPORTIVE APPARTENENTI ALL'ITALIA, AVVERTITI
*my broke ah just watching this vid wishing i could have a ferrari*
His first and last Ferrari this man is built different
"Me Playing Forza In Cenimatic mode" lol
"We have a dinner to make at 2:00" LMAO gotta love this guy
When that Ferrari was prancing on the hills, I can hear the the car praising with "THIS is what I was made for.  Thank you, WhistlinDiesel."  Unfortunately, Ferrari has a tenancy to keep mistranslating that as "OMG HELP ME IM BEING USED FOR PERSONAL ENJOYMENT!!"
now hes definitely getting blacklisted by ferrari
should of seen if the china balloon was bullet proof
Frankly and seriously, I am more impressed with Ferrari now than when I started watching this.  They should give you a bonus payment.
it just hurts
that’s the right video to say whether i should cry or smile
Ferarri hates this video
This is what I do in FH4
$400000... u know how many macbook pros u could buy with that
Noooooo😢😢
This is the coolest thing I’ve seen in a long time,what would Johnny Knoxville do 2.0😂😂
seems like ferrari good offroad car
imbecille ci estingueremo
Rip Ferrari 😅
Seems pretty durable.
4:23 hdahsdhahdasHDAhdash lmfao that was unexpected, anyways who cares abut some salty italics?
Just typical Forza gameplay here
This guy can drive good btw
Dont wory he is just playing Forza Horizon 5
Am I the only person getting irritated by his face when I see it? :(
I hope you will notice me sir . I have a request for my birthday on September 10 that I hope to be given a gift, I will accept any gift.   # #I would like to bring my own car thank you idol!
I woke up in a new ferrari
bro will be added to the ferrari blacklist
disrespectful
I love every second of this video
Portfel aaaa uciekam
Why the f**k are you doing all of that to this luxury ferrari ?
I don't get it, how is it going to wreck by him driving like that?? It looks really fun!
dude is playing forza horizon IRL
ferrari is overprice piece of shit fuck the company they fuckin s uck sferraris are super gay lambo is way better ferrari sucks ass i love this video f uck the haters
it would be nice if he send me 100k so i can pay off my dad home :D
Why?
Bro money doesn’t grow on trees
How can anyone afford to make videos like this?
Best scene: 13:15
Ahh, I am actually happy being in a electric pickup truck that is cheaper than a lambo, a porsche, a mclaren, a bugatti and a ferrari. While listening to 80's electronic music while it tows a trailer that has a trophy truck that is covered in wraps.
In Germany we say: "Das gibt ne Anzeige mein Freund!"
pure  envy just envy
age doesnt always come with wiseness
The last test had me in stitches , if only they had a kitchen sink to throw
WHY is this SO FUNNY?! This is how you should test cars! HAHA LOL :D
My boy is out here living GTAV in real life
That's painful to watch!
Should’ve bought a Koenigsegg
its hurting sooo much to see that fr
just why waste that much amount of money
f$ck , we struggle to buy a 20000$ car but this guy ...
Cars are meant to be driven damn it
What a great choice to destroy your 400,000 dollar ferrari edit: I didn't watch the full vid at this time. Sorry about that
This video was so hard to take but entertaining at the same time🤣😬
pov: me in forza 5
in 7:50 its just fh5
Most absurd thing I’ve ever seen
Now buy the lamborghini just to destroy it.
bro really wants to be sued 500 times 💀💀💀💀💀💀
You can't do this.
This video is actually very good,  it taught me  valuable lesson.  1. Ferraris can handle more than I thought 2. They are very durable 3. Damn it sounded awesome with a new exhaust.
Eveyone who owns a Ferrari or a luxury car now is crying while watchin this xD You are the first person to actually enjoy a luxury vehicle to the fullest extent.
It is better to destroy yourself.
pov : He thinks he plays forza horizon
Try this with a z06 C7!
i Derk off with every car he steps on  love whi_te men
How does he make that  much money
Plis 100.000 euro
U are so dum there u’s Someone there dont have money and lives in a trach can 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
NOO
With a pencil
The "Give me a hammer" clip was hilarious.
Bro, how are you not in debt? how are you not bankrupt? That’s the question I’m totally blown away. How does he even afford to do all these things man is he like MrBeast where he had like infinite money or some shit
Never watched a WhitlinDiesel video.   My first thought is that just because you can afford to do something stupid doesn't mean that you should.   If this is what this channel is like, I am not a fan.
sid no one notice the hurcan sto cover?
BRO has a hole garage  with a huragan a bently 2 old ass porshes and more
So no one talk about the Lamborghini cover on a Ferrari 😂
Forza Horizon 6 leaks
He's driving car like its just a toy RC car. ;-;
Congrats of beiing a idiot
Shoulda put the wagon wheels on it and rolled through town
Love the Lambo cover. Hahaha
This is Ferrari rally✊🤩
He's playling Forza in rl
Sometimes, the Horse™ must be brought back to its habitat ;)
I can't look
Went you wanted you destroy the Ferrari but it is invisible😂😂
not sure where the hell you read your comments about ferrari's from but every comment i see about a ferrari is complements not lawsuits
it hurts so much
I don't like you man I'm sorry I just don't you I could never if you're destroying 400k just wtf is wrong with you, are you trying to be funny w all these starving comedians in the world
Next Video: I Bought A 1.3 Million Dollar Boat To Put Wheels On It.
I know for a fact that there is an Ferrari engineer somewhere in italy having a seizure right now.
What if You wanted to play FH5 in real life But Ferrari said Time to bust out some lawsuits
It would be great to watch him take the car to the service department and ask them what’s wrong with all of the codes that popped up😂
wasn't destroyed booooy....
That's just disgusting lmao
What a idiot channel... 🤢🤮
I saw it all muddy tonight at Perrys and my coworkers were like “wash your car clearly you have money” i was like nah y’all just gotta wait for the part 2 in a few weeks 😂😂
Are you in Ohio🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What is wrong with you?
If you dont need it anymore, you can ship it to swizerland my friend.
You should buy a Ferrari and swap the engine for a Diesel!
Can i get that Ferrari please ? 🙏😁
Eu no forza horizon 5 😆🤘🏻
I think whislindiesel is every car collectors worst nightmare
that hurt my heart
All and all but he's the only one Ive seen drifting a ferrari trough mud
9:40 - Unreal. It looks like a shot from a video game.
Seriously that air cover really works like a charm
Fc.
I like how he destroys a tank but not a Ferrari
fo ra sec i thought he said koenisex LOL instead of koenigsegg
You had fun and gave every Ferrari exec a heart attack in one swoop.
It fucking hurt seeing this
OH NO! MY CAR!
I would do this if I didn’t care about money
Cut the Ferrari in half and turn the rear section into a camper trailer like Chris NSX and NSX trailer sleeper combo.
He really treated the car like in GTA 5 or Forza Horizon
O cara é brabo
if you want to get rich became like him because he is not afraid of getting his car torn apart
Is the the banjo kid from Deliverance?
I love this this dude and his show but he’s nuts. LOL 😂
crazy
crazy how much better off road it is then i thought
How good is this guys fucking camera crew, gg guy
I fucking missed Old youtube, thanks so much you absolute American Chad
It didn’t have the fate like the fire truck or the pack yak
Non poteva che essere un americano.
Ah, I love you man. Someday we will meet and we can race our ferraris.
This is just Forza Horizon in real life
I've watched 3 minutes and I'm already crying for this car
This shit is fing hilarious!!!
because the mud mantle was from Lamborghini 🤔🤔🤔
What no destroy the ferrari You até idiot Man e que sabe eu sou em português porra puta que pariu
Wow
#PHUCKFERRARI  Ferrari is overhyped, moraly and ethically bankrupt trash. Their cars suck for the price, and then the company is tantamount to demonic BDSM.  If I was the richest man on earth, I'd die happily knowing I never wasted a penny on Ferrari trash. Not even worthy of being compacted into neat cubes of metallic refuse...  #PHUCKFERRARI
the fact that at the start of th e video car covering sheet is labo is wild
*ferrari joined the chat*
This is stupid. Just stupid.
Just here for the Algorithm :D
WHY CAT :(
an opscore helmet? too poor for an airframe
now imagine if that last small piece would blow up that bubble ?
so painfull to watch . why. for likes ? what next ?
Part 2?
Another internet spoiled brat if you wouldn't help somebody in need with those four hundred thousand dollars you probably would have a lot more views and you have done a great thing
people be treating this car like gold but we have learnt it is extremley durable
man literally just did a demo on how to be one with the GTA universe.
That much money and u destroyed them could easily help the poor people.  I am wondering why u have so many likes and views with this video... The viewers should thing first before they give that like... also i think you are disrespectful for the company of ferrari  it self, but its your chanel ia am just putting a comment on it.
Why....
the bro is playing forza horizon in real life 😂💔
do it with McLaren 🇬🇧
Please if you don't want it give it to me
Holy shit, WhistlingDiesel had the dodge reflexes of George W. Bush.
Hit one in the off road lamb0
.
GO TO HELLLLLL NOWWWWW ITSSSSS A Ferrari  A 400,000  CAR OMGGGGG
Why are you so wasteful? Because you can be? Says everything about your character.
BRAZIL
There is no way the production cost of this video was less than the youtube money he got for it
I don’t understand why they are surprised it made it up a hill, super cool vids though man keep it up!
Whistlin to Ferrari dont worry its just monkey business
inSNAE RETard
But you're a son of a bitch Why are you giving me Mister Beast
Animals like y'all find that entertaining huh well go roll in your filth
Nahh this just me playing FH 5 messing around.
Daddy must be proud of how you spend his money!
I've just fell through a rabbit hole of WhistlinDiesel videos; Love the content!!
It did surprisingly well. I was worried about the cameramen the whole time, though.
Bro covered a ferrari with a lambo sheet
very funny approved.
Good job dude hate those oveprced garbage cans
But does it have a custom Cartier steering wheel?
*me playing in gta5*
3:15 lol
lamborghini funded this video
Enzo is crying in his grave... and I love it. Such an entertaining video!
i cant be the only one that saw that the cover it said lamborgini
Where did you buy the helmet? It would be useful to know, thanks
Idiocy times a thousand.
I am literally crying
Vendedor: ""Unico dono, era de um empresario que andou pouco""
In all anticipation I watched to the very end to see the one thing I was certain was going to show up thrown on the bubble. KITCHEN SINK, of course. What happened? Couldn't find one lying around? Funny as girls in prom dresses rolling around in mud . Thanks!
ok i understand now you are rich cool i am smiling
You're just fucking earth hoes with no culture
Why are you doing this to me? I'm crying for them. It's my dream car. Please give me one instead of destroying them😢
This is the best Ferrari ad I've ever seen
As an enginner in process ! This is crazyy!! But never treat your car like this! Good work very entertaining!

11:21 Bro the camera guy          They did this of everything didn't they?😅
I'm pretty sure that many italians, who are watching this video are making a vodoo doll of... you know who.😅
that is a dream car for people like me and you are showing off the money you get from people like me. not fair at all. you should not do that with peoples dreams.. so not fair that god gave you the money to spend on this and not help people.
Filha da mãe você só quer pegar o canal do
Fucking crazy guy
the first word that comes to mind when i see you and your channel is a posh little toe rag trashing stuff he could never buy without the help from his daddy. you are a total muppet and a laughing stock.
no but why does he look like vertsappen
Bro whistling can I have that farrari bro
Bro can you buy me a car bro let me no bro
Forza in real life
I am enjoying this video, i have carbon frame road bikes and do similar tests to them, if some company sell you something you have the right to do whatever you want with the product and have fun.
Mans out here living the dream in my childhood
lol i like how he said we have killed some people lol.....i need friends
This was actually a great commercial for Ferrari and that car bubble. Also, when you're done beating the shit out of the car, can you please film yourselves taking it into a Ferrari dealer for service and trying to keep a straight face.
I love seeing people destroying shit!! And making money!!! Please burn your house down !!!! I would subscribe if you burn your house down!!!!! I am a dead broke white trash living in a trailer ...this guy destroyed cars buses helicopters and never worked a shit job at a gas station trying to make ends meet...good for him...ya!!!!!! Good job!!!he beat the system!!!! He is not worried about shit in life!!!!!
hell yeah, blow that thing up!
This hurt to watch. But that last bit with car bubble was hilarious
The Lamborghini cover😂
What a prick. Just light a pile of money on fire to show us what a douche you are. Pain
Dude is playing Forza irl
Please stop
He is known in Italy as 50,000$ dead or alive
You cool
meanwhile in America
Tout les européens en sueur
13:20 me in the kitchen when everyone is asleep
Ferreri's teams is coming to cut your balls for this
i laughed, i cried
I get it, 10 million views in 3 months.....ad revenue alone paid for the car prob 6 times over, but damb....there is no way i could destroy that car.
This is the only guy who can do anything to anything
😂😂lmao
I hope its from pandabuy😅
As an Aussie I approve
It's not new to me what you've done here 7:32 .  I did it too on ForzaHorizon4😂
Oh i get it. Buy it, sell it by parts.
Ooooh que bieeeen, jajajaja🫣   Unos dias de unboxing en las carceles de italia no estaria mal ¿no? Un saludo de nuestros abogados🤌🏻
AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH thisbhurts me.
Habibi im broke af… next time before destroying valuable stuff, ask me if I need it.
So forza horizon didn’t like to me, you can bushwhack across winter meadows in a super car
it remnds me of howtbasic
Why don’t you just put all this money to good use….😢😢😢
Who TF is this guy? Tony Stark's son? Now if you'll excuse me, I have job applications to fill out.
The plainrock 124 of car YouTubers. I can’t get enough enjoyment from this channel
That ending was incredible
POV: your camping in the woods and a Ferrari flys by with a missing bumper
My face(s) the whole time watching this 😰🫣🫢😵‍💫😷
Puts a Lamborghini cover on a Ferrari. The level of disrespect…. I love it
why??!!!! DESTROY a beautiful car like that?
I wish I could have the car :(
Omg wtf lol 😂😂😂😂😂
You earnt a sub
This is how supercars get treated in the middle east. The oil tycoons have money out the wazoo to care and do maintenance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySLHgsln8_s&ab_channel=DougDeMuro
bros playing forza irl💀
If you want your product tested... you send it to this guy... epic video! haha
Everyone talking about the Ferrari but that bubble is impressive
This is more like an advertisement for Ferrari
Cant put in words how happy thsi video makes me
If people want to get butthurt about this, I hope they don't find out about Rally Racing. Suped up cars flying (sometimes literally) down dirt and gravel backroads. Also hope they don't find out about Destructive Testing, a common thing in engineering and quality control
thie guy should get canceled.
POV: FORZA Horizon in real life
the end had me panicking
just WHY!?
Man 😢 I could make good use for  that money
Why are people in the Facebook comments saying you need to stop doing drugs 😂. Old ppl have me dying
click bait

U should shoot the bubble

I don’t care a shit about yr stupid fathers  tractor that got stolen you think anybody cares no. You act like an asshole to make money on youtube. Get rich then we are suppose to feel sorry for you lol. Im just upset with the public who buys yr shit. Fuck yr  a waste of skin
simply take it to lo santos customs for a $275 repair, duh
Red is the official racing color of Italy and it is disrespectful to have your Ferrari red when you are not racing and I think that they look better with clear paint and the bear metal color.
He didn´t even try to destroy a car.
do you know how to take care of a expencive car
Buy my Acura for 5k and give it a viking burial.
I laughed but I refuse to condone this behaviour with a like.
One of the most stupid videos I‘ve watched in my whole life. Congrats!
Can I buy this car 😂
where does this guy get his money
Man i watch this video many times very unsual that's how you know it's a good video
@exotics driver
You are stupid don't buy if you don't want it. Don't west your money like this give it to some poor people
He treated trash accordingly- good man!
driving skill at its peak
Damn if I had to throw away that much money I’d have more fun helping people out with it. Pay some medical bills, save some lives.
You should do a video where you get a restored military humvee and test it.
The bubble bit had me laughing so hard I cried.
dude your driving -lol!!! amazing!!
this has to be the best ad for rarri
Instead of donating the money to organizations u pos
can we all appreciate how actually good of a driver cody is
Forza Horizon be like…
This is what happens when youre YouTube life reach a point where the only thing left to do is behaving stupid.....
Bring back the thrill of pure driving pleasure! No computers, no fuel injectors (carburetors) no power steering (rack and pinion) and no paddle shifters ( classic six-slotted gated shift linkage) Make mine an analog!
can you try the rezvani tank
Horizon irl
Bro's literally playing GTA in real liife
before you waste your time he didn't destroy it lmao
Hahahhahah you rock!
At the end of the day, it's just a car. Always remember that.
Muchos queriendo tener este coche y un gilipollas lo empieza a destrozar porque le sobra el dinero
Mr whistling diesel The lawsuits aren’t just it. It’s just the cease and desist
Ik this is an older video I’ll comment on another of your new videos but you got to do a show and tell of your car collection.
I love this. The ending was hilarious 😂
bro he is destroying my dream car. i worked for 2 years and i couldnt even get quarter of the car's price this guy is litteraly making me look stupid fighting my life over a car he bought and destroy at the same time and he dont care . (Fu*k my life man)
You should put a lift kit on it
pov: forza horizon players
Este wey es mi ídolo 🙇🏻‍♂️
POV watching this video in pain.😢
i know that this video probably paid like 10 of this ferraris, but men this hurts...
Whatta goof😎🤓😇
Dude, that was like a $300 ladder you were throwing around! Sheesh
Guys like you are the pinnacle of an affluent, stupid and degenerate society and platforms like YT finance that. But whatever, 5.56 million missing links should be excited about it😆
Nothing but awesome, auto manufacturers need to send their cars to this guy for "REAL" testing, I loved seeing the car rolling thru the rain and mud going up hill and thru the brush HAHAHAHAHAH
You created the perfect commercial for that air bubble protection thing
0i
When you get bored in forza
13:18 bro just asked for a hammer
Fast forward three months and he’s begging people to buy his merch to pay legal fees 😂
how do you get the money for all of this stuff
Impressed w/ the off-road ability of the car & how well the bubble worked
I wish had as much money as this guy so i can pay off my house and be able to fill up my cupboards with food being a ehite south African has its draw backs because of BEE but what can i do they only emply black people they dont care if you can do a job or not just the color of my skin but of course buy things and wreck them as you shoukd such a waste and i would've helped if i could have with your court bills by watching fmads so u could get the revenue but after watching this sickening vid you donr need it clearly you are extremely rich so yeah gl mr diesel u clearly dont need it
This is exactly how every Ferrari should be treated. Fuck those arrogant Ferraris.
Go on the German Autobahn with it
you guys should buy some iconic racing car or something. like the hoonicorn or an original audi S1...
BRO I HATE WATCHING SOMEONE DESTROY MY DREAM CAR LOLLL, but i also kinda enjoy it
bro stop this   shitt    man
Hell yeah, you wasted a ton of money! You're cool bro!
Damn if you wouldn't have destroyed it you wouldn't be selling tshirts ❤
This man is a menace to society
This hurt to watch
the rich kid at school on holdiays:   ok but genuinely i feel bad for everything he destroys. like where does he get the money for all of this
Okay, I actually want a Ferrari now.  This entire video is a brilliant advertisement for Ferrari.  If it can go places most 2wd trucks can't go with the clearance I want one.
Le boiserie a du souci à se faire 😂👌
Instead of giving it to me
He should go field stomping again then drive it as is to a Ferrari meet. I'm sure feathers would be ruffled!😂
real life GTA
bro drives cars like its gta XD
4:07 backflip out of a ferrari
Nigga didn't destroy the Ferrari
my favourite part of the video was when he destroyed the Ferrari
Man is playing forza horizon irl
Why does the car cover say Lamborghini at 0:37 😂 Is that a hint to say that you have bought a Lamborghini ? 🤔
did you get sued tho?
I’m from Southbend let’s hang out and do some fun shit!!!
i’m so glad you he didn’t destroy it
Where was it destroyed in the video?
you should buy a nice car and let your friends drive it just to egg them
I think he made this video to be like fuckah yuuuu frararri!!!
I've done those hill climbs in sport scars in GTA and THAT felt reckless :|
I love how he is like " Supercar Schmuckercar ! LETS WRECK THIS SHIT ! " xD
putting "purrari" and a cat logo isnt infringing on their trademark or copyright at all, at worst its parody which is legal, at best its a completely untrademarked symbol and word hes putting on a piece of his property, nothing illegal about it at all. being cowed into submission by threatening letters from lawyers isnt the same as something being illegal
Bros playing with his ferrari like its GTA
Question is... if someone actually buys their car, out right... who cares what they do with them😂
Buy me a 40,000$ car and ill keep it for life 🤷🏼‍♂️
13:59.. don’t think it did the best protecting that toss 😂
Destroy a Ferrari. . .  Subscribed
Best Ferrari ad on the planet.
This guy is a Total Idiot.  Born with a Silver Spoon up his Ass. From Mommy and Daddys monet. Left to them from tbe hard working Grandparents.  Just and Idiot. Looking for Attention.
You should buy a full sized airplane and crash it
This video Will be legend and remembered
DESTROY IT !!!!!!
You are the best person ever. So true with Ferrari, my father has had several including the 599 GTO and every time he went to the dealership he felt ripped off. $18000 for ball joints after 1000km? what a joke. Please run over this car with your monster truck, it is not worth the manufacturer control over their product. As far as I am concerned, you own it after the transaction, drive it through cow patties to your heart's content.
welcome on the blacklist my friend hahah
Me just wanting to pay for my car and you destroying it :(
13:16 Cody: "I think that did pretty well. Let's try something else. Gimme a hammer."  Everyone: *proceeds to throw everything except the kitchen sink*
the car is going to start printing out a cease and desist letter out of the dash
Drive it upside down next time cody
cancel this man......                         JK
This Channel is a cringe rich kid being cringe
Bro got money to burn fr
This is a true Forza Horizon moment
My dad before i was born :
Honestly? This is actually an impressive commercial for Ferrari. That car did far more than I would have expected.
This actually hurt my feelings a little bit. I kinda want it when he finishes.
I am definitely getting a ranch and a ferrari just to do this when Im rich
i do know hou and why you did that at a beutiful ferrari
you are to stupid
*_Can't Believe They're Playing Forza Horizon In Real Life!_*
why to destroy buy me ferrari instead : ((
4:36 The emotion he gave is priceless 😂
ferrari is much more durable than I thought!!
Forza Horizon 5 IN REAL LIFE
this video physically hurt me
Tbh after seeing this I'm convinced that Ferrari needs rally team. I wanna see rally ferrari now. Even more, we need to resurrect group B and make group B Ferrari.
Sid from Toy Story if he got rich
Will still buy it for 20 bucks 😂😅
U should let a fan come thrash on the Ferrari 👋
What was the Suppra doing in the background?
At least he is actually using it
@ferrari
😂😂😂😂😂😂
But me a Ferrari and I won’t destroy it
POV:Forza or BeamNG drive

But you didnt destroy it actually xd
I hate Ferrari as a company and I love to see this
The random muffin sheet 💀
My dad was traumatised watching this 😂
Daqui a pouco será proibído de comprar novas ferraris.
Can't watch this
I want to like this type of stuff but i could pay off my student loans twice over for this much. God damn theres deep money in this world I suppose.
😂he guy lives forza horizon in real life😂

Give me the car if you dont want it😅
Driving in GTA be like.

You're whislinDiese You can do whatever you what with your property. Send IT!!!!!!
But can you see why kids love the taste of Cinnamon Toast Crunch?
Hay mang you got anymore of them ferarie go fast feather bottons? Been on real hard times running the generator to watch the video??
it should end with the camera panning over enzo ferrari's grave and then a hand punching up through the dirt.
I love how he just gradually starts destroying it. 😂
"Just from that? I didn't even do anything, dude." 😂
5:03 W204 C63 😍
Death fears him
Should of have the tank ran it over.
This is like climbing mountains in a super car in gta 5
Hey man..can I have one of those..without the tune cause I'm deaf anyway.
That blonde dude was having a heart attack
Cody: "give me a hammer"  Everyone: *proceeds to throw the entire shop on the car*
It’s like playing the crew
That was One of the funniest ones😂
The Ferrari lawyers watching died of jump scares :D
i love how their emblem costs 14 grand, but costs 45 cents to make.
This video made me cry😢
Gta 5 mode
Need a hat to😮
Bro Is playing forza irl
…
RESPECT FOR CAR    .....ZERO!!👎👎👎👎👎
Too much money, this shit is so retard that it hurts my brain
This cover could potentially save from huge hail
Where the hell does the money come from, i truly don't understand. But i gotta say, you put it to good use
The engineers crying that it went through hell and half an acre and works perfectly fine
This man did rally 4 in a rrari
You just giveaway this to one of your subscribers 😢😮😊
we are coming after you
Ended up benefit those snoots anyway
قلبي الصغير لا يتحمل 😢💔
dude is just livin his best life lol, absolutely amazing
That car cost twice as much as my house
Yeah but a Koenigsegg can survive that because its Swedish steel!!
La trato como a "una cualquiera"
Quiero que hable en españolll
Actually really good marketing for Ferrari
amazing
You guys have something i don't A LAWSUIT😢😂 10:06
Damn i can't even afford a truck
Imagine a ferrari with a rally kit
In Australia and we did this the car would be taken by police and forfeited to state government to sell 😂
Forza irl
You should go to jail for this level of disrespect for real, tf is wrong with you rich folks?
What’s under a Lamborghini cover, not a Lamborghini 😂 0:38
The Ferrari is amazing and the video was so hilarious maybe because I grew up with a Ferrari in the garage and if anything were to happen to it the wold would suddenly end.
What a bunch of pssie in these comments, its just a stupid car 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bro is using the ferrari like a forza horizon player
That was awesome. But what about the kitchen sink being thrown at the Ferrari that's what I was waiting for at the end lol.
What in the world is this ilegal "nahhh its a real life gta"
0:00 last frame until a lawsuit was made
Buy a bmw and rally it a new one like an m2 or m4
You got money to spend like that.... How about you shoot me a little dough 😅
This hurts to watch but I can’t look away
Forza 5
When are you doing a John deer combined durability test
This guy is like this is how rich people have fun
the Ferraris untouchable(singing)
Although, I understand the reason why the video is made, it is heart breaking to watch, I would sell my soul (almost) to have a Ferrari. Especially something like a Ferrari 250 GT Cabriolet Pininfarina Series I or a 365 Spyder California such beautiful cars.
That last bit was actually such a good commercial for the bubble cover thing whatever it is
cody plays gta in real life 😅
4:11 we do not care
Feffari Company Here. Our Employees hear you have not broken any rules of our customs but have a tendancy, habit of destruction of items.
You lucky guy than you can destroy Ferrari. I even couldn't d destroy my Suzuki Swift 2003 5d 1.0l 3 cyl. engine, because I respect that car so much.
Ferrari is right. Americans have no style, that's why they need to trash other people's culture. You'd trash anything on screen for a bunch of views. That's why your country is going down the drain. You have nothing sacred except money. Soulless country
im just crying for this...what the hell of mess you doing...
First thing that comes to mind? WD doesn't have enough money to convince Ferrari to sell him one... EVER! 😂
As a Ferrari F40 fan, a product of group B, I'm satisfied seeing a monster go han
Ngl this was great
I feel like ferrari is gonna sue me for watching this
The general Lee was still better!
Out here playing forza
It's your $$$ so nobody should tell you what you can or can not do.
Bros finding all the special features
This is painful to watch.
You forgot to throw the kitchen sink at the blowup car protector.
Wastefull spoiled rich kid , how about do something usefull like , i dont know help homeless vets , helping people in need instead of destroying things that are super expensive , you want to waste money send me some our drains are busted , roof is leaking and cant get help to fix it , but yeah waste all the money you want ass.

What I wonder is not how they are destroying ferrari,  I wonder why they’re so much ladders 🪜
12:14 the next clips are full of heart attacks.
ferrari please compete in rally with your cars jus tlike they are
So I was like oh no this is crazy not the Ferrari abuse but I was like this is actually awesome
Hell yeah man  run the shit like s pro. 👍
The F8 is the best car ive ever driven. Its unlike anthing else. Cant blame Cody for not smashing it.
Ladder hits at 13:57
How does he have so much money
Jakie to ferari?
This video is a literal satisfaction
What if the cameras were all out of battery during filming this?
Did he get sued yet?
This is the best Ferrari commercial in the history of their existence
I had to go in therapy after this video
Should do a 12 valve Cummins swap on this car
We gonna talk about the hurrican evo weather cover...
To pierwszy polski komentarz kto  tik tok

Ok um... I didn't know Ferraris were so durable. A whole new level of respect for this car!
4:38 bruh this dudes face has me soaring
guys are living in forza horizon 5
why is the ferari under a lamborgihni
This guy is insane at driving. He can drive like any car at max speed without any preparation/testing.
White people do the most dumbest shit . Use your money to help the homeless instead
Which gta  server?
stop copying MrBeast
Man fuck you  Sincerely, an Italian
Bubble protector officially approved .
Who noticed Lamborghini cover on Ferrari 😅
This is awesome 👍
So nice
Imagine paying 400k for a car and you can get sued for doing whatever you want with it 😂
I don't see anything amusing about this video and i think you are quite a jerk.
You waste gas and material shame on you.
satisfaction
I have Ferrari
Wheres the kitchen sink?
He does that which is not normal too expensive things to attract many views and then YouTube turns around runs ads on his videos and then pays him a lot of money for doing that which is abnormal and wasteful
Can i get the car now?
clickbait
Taxtherich kinda vibes
Plz stop it im gonner hate you
Can u believe there are ppl in this world, which would be happy, actually having a car?
There are somr sensors that are very sensitive more than ferrari that got me cracking dude you the man😂😂😂

I knew that Forza Horizon gameplay was realistic! Suck on that, sim bros!
What the heck does he have in all those bigass cases??
I don't find most things you do funny. However, that last 30 seconds had me laughing. Congrats on truly enjoying a luxury sports car.
hi
people who rated this video can be divided in two: the ones who laugh cant buy a ferrari, the ones who are sad own or owned a ferrari (or similar real sport cars). Thats it
This guy's a complete idiot and doesn't deserve to have that car
Why are you not giving to me this money you fcking diot!
Cody makes super cars actually seem fun and cool. Everyone always babies them and I careful. This actually makes them seem fun and cool.
Your so amazing bro  From Philippines
Wow that’s a kool fast sports car.
4:40 hahaha 🤣 💀
moxdr
นายสุดยอดมากๆๆๆๆๆ
They are too scared to sue him
If ferrari didn't have anyone to sue they'd be bankrupt
Your friend reactions are priceless 😂
Please sue him,
damn
Thought it’d actually get destroyed
Subtle turbski noises 🥵
Am I the only one who noticed that right here 4:10 Cody's shoes squeaking on the ground sound like the Pixar lamp jumping
Bro, why would you destroy it?
Fun fact: Ferrari tried to sue this guy for making this video
when your dad have too much money to care about you, and you have too much free time you ended up doing shit like this
Can i get the chance to see the car before you destroy it 😂

I am blind because I stabbed my eyes out.
normal day A guy : touches ferrari logo       ferrari : calling air strike , E.T.A. 10 minutes  To target

You should have bought a set of winter tires for off road they have mad traction
They need a We Will Sue Your  Wallet Out of your Jeans 👖 warning Light
Im glad you didnt get a 458, those are at least nice cars, one of the last before production quality went wayyy down.

Car cover company 👁️.👁️
It's all fun and games until he gets his hands on a Rolls Royce!
Me driving my 2million dollar car in gta:
Why dose Ferrari think they’re special they sell a bunch of cars and call their cars Limited
As a Ferrari lover, Cody is the only person on this planet I would actually watch destroy one from testing the shit out of it. Love this channel.
https://youtube.com/shorts/PMWeRugv8Ek?feature=share  Leaked Ferreira video
13:18 when u get in girls bathroom by an accident be like:
The next lot $400000 just give it to us. I don’t think this is funny.
😡😡😡🤬
as uncle roger said "only white people can destroy things and laugh"
Bro I love your videos but am crying😢 and fucking laghing😂😂 at the sametime..
You belong in the fucking Sandbox man! idiots like these with no respect to the cars should get back to their toy cars instead. too much money with little brain activity then you get this crap.
Wrap the Ferrari with nyan cat
One day ill be able to afford a prius to blow uo lol
So what I learned is Ferraris are actually really good off-road
at least you knew it was something you could never get rid of and ty for not even manually damaging It
8:32 me in gta when i get bored and decide to climb a mountain in a supercar
u better have insurance
5:58 diesel is an appalachian guerilla confirmed
How did he get so much money?
As usual Whistle'n brand blind folds required to view this
Whistlin diesels haters are like OMG you should of gave that car that u earned to people in need because they deserve it
Just came across this video 😂😂😂 these guys are sociopaths
WTF bro..... people saving many money to buy this car, and you buy it then destroy it
Ever thought about buying a Leopard 2 tank and try to destroy it with your face? It would be an interesting video. Also, it would probably fix your acne problem, as it would surely eradicate your scars!!!
Wow. Your contribution to humanity is impressive. What would humankind do without you?
fuck he got sued
Must be nice to have daddy's money
Congratulations, whistling diesel you’re the first person to actually enjoy a luxury vehicle to the fullest extent.
What does this charade matter to a hungry person 😢
This guy must have ADD crazy fuck :)
Try Lamborghini
Click bait he doesn't destroy the Ferrari. I guess we've seen a limit to how big his balls are. I guess this was just too expensive for him to destroy, booooo
If you buy it. It is yours. How in the hell can a car company sue you for modifying your property 🙄.
Imagine if this video didnt blow up like he thought it would and he just spent 400k for nothing. Wished we lived in a world where shit videos like this werent monetised
Just a long commercial for a bubble how yall think he afforded that Ferrari lmao jk
8:36, “ITS A MAD TEAAA PARTYY”
Pov: you playing GTA V in irl
Mendingan buat saya saja bang
Ferrari Sue this dude
Personally ive always thought Ferrari looked better than lambo or other high end sports cars. I just love the smooth lines paired with the iconic red.
If the 10mm wasn’t missing, it sure is after this video
He is filthy frank of the car world
Forza horizon 5 in real life dope💀
Why is the headlights on at broad daylight
🤡Fugue Ferrari... & FBJ
The cease and desist letter in the mailbox lol
This is crazy 🤣🤣
💩
Konegsieg durability test
The amount of dirt it scooped up
As an Italian, this is painful to watch.              I subbed
Wanna buy a property I live at in Pennsylvania? We can destroy shit on it? Just not looking to have to move after all these years.   PS I build with concrete!
I'm on the fence cause 1/10th the value of that car could change a person's life, and to buy it just to smash it to crap?? Entertaining? Yea. Insulting? Somewhat. But this is coming from a broke mofo so I digress.
Dude just got banned from Italy
😒
Destroy 400.000$ Send me 5000$😂😂
WhistlinDiesel,  I hereby challenge you to a destroy off. HMU for the terms
Best ads for protective bubble thing i've ever see
He just wants to be in dept
this guy have ADHD or something? he aint right
He should’ve broken their terms and seen if they sue him, seemed kinda scared to face their legal team but I can’t blame him either
9:39, oddly one of the coolest shots every with the lightning like that. And gl with your lawsuits.
That's stupidest thing I have seen this month
Hey buddy u sent me a msg, notifications deleted it...,  Please resend
Bro plays gta in real life :D
Never go to Italy. You will be executed by dawn.
If you were the owner of Ferrari, i'm sure you wouldn't complain about all the brand protection they have 😂 Come on, it is the most famous car brand in the world, you need to protect the horse from head to toe.
Lol
The hero we all need lol
Only if it was a SF90‼️
WHAT DID I JUST WATCH? Not sorry for caps xD
Hear me out, get the og cast of top gear together and do a collaboration with them. I think that would one of the most epic episodes ever.

I have no idea who you are, I stumbled upon klipklip by accident. My family and I live on 160 euros a month. I don't even have Jugo to buy. Now explain to me the point of the clip, to show how much you are idiot? I think if you are a cool guy you could have spent that money on much important things
Take a lambo truck off-roading
Is it only me that saw the lamborgini hurucan bag on ferrari at the begining of the video?
This man just play forza horizon irl

I'm happy that someone made this video! I literally thought about making a video myself on rallying with a sportscar (but I don't have money for it)!  You should try to rally with Lamborghini Huracan Sterrato as hard as you can!
At least he didn't crash the car on high speed like some other people
Dudes playing forza horizon irl
this is forza irl
lol
I love that he had a Lambo cover on it.
Forza irl
“Give me a hammer” Proceeds to throw the entire shop😂
Great Content, can I have the Ferrari now?
I think you just created an ad for that bubble protector lol
13:20 I can’t breathe. I’m just sitting here alone watching this montage of flying things laughing at all of it and can’t stop
me in GTA:
Waiting on a vlog with DDE
this just shows how lost the world is :) that people waste their time watching and probably donating, buying merch....from idiots like this so they can waste money to destroy something good, well i wish yall good luck when the dollar crashes soon ahahhaha
that car cover seriously needs to pay you some advertising fee. thats insane
That is some insane power for a 2w drive.. i bet your nuts were in your throat.
what a Moth*******!
That’s tear it up
#ferari 😂😂
13:39 WAS THAT GUNSHOTS?? HAHAH
It hurts but I keep watching for some reason
So at 1:44 you see a car with beat up rear side, and a green licence plate, someone took thqt car for a drive from the dealwr chuz that playe is installed when you test drive it, so he or insurance wasnt happy at al
Id assume americans just shoot at it
Have fun with your "Cease and desist"
Real life Forza👍
He is literally me....           In GTA O
I have to baby my truck so I can make I to work everyday.  You are doing everything I've dreamed of!! Cut out the rear fenders, slap some boggers on it, and enter a demolition derby!  Keep up the videos bro!!
Engineers probably love watching these videos, the only time their creation is actually going to be tested to its maximum
Man carbon fiber sure is great
Farrari banned you because you are destroyed ferrari car 😂😂
Oh God, give me the car, bro😊
Add tank tracks to it 😂
Don't get it why people so obsessed with Ferrari lawsuits and blacklisted celebrities. They literally created 288 GTO for group b racing and they built 308 rally versions so this car absolutely can be driving as rally conditions there's no cease and desist problem. But please don't ruin your car
Top 10 ways to get sued by ferrari
Pathetic dumb Americans. What a piece of trash for wasting a Ferrari
Next time you wanna just blow money just send me some I’d greatly appreciate it
Where’s the part where you actually destroy it?
Who makes the exhaust you installed? Sounds great
u should get a koneseg
Aslo con un 22r
Please
Destroy a car with nathan karhu
THIS CAR MEANS NOTHING TO HIM!!!!
I’m gonna be honest 400k for an f8 is crazy
If you do not buy it from Ferrari then they can not do anything to you. If you bought it new from the dealer there is all sorts of stuff you sign and agree to.
Enzo is so happy

...pretentious, clout-chasing, tasteless idiots.   They made a iconic brand, sold You georgeous car, while You are clowning around on camera for internet plebians upvotes and damaging it, while not being clever enough to design even one component for it.  I hope You'll get sued to hell.

someone playing GTA in real life😂
just another young & dumb youtuber with less respect than his stupid desire for views> you got my comment this time. never again! You are a complete IDIOT!
Your not normal in Your Head, others would work Years for that to own ....
The drifts tho
When you said "this" and Doug popped up I fucking died 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I do the same to Diesel vehicles, so much fun.
Bros the real mr bombastic
There are many hard-working people out there that would love to have a $4000 car. The bus to work bro.
I was wrong when I played forza and swore to god the Ferrari wouldn’t do well off road.
What if he sues Ferrari
It was all good but the end was very good 😂
Hi Sam  👋
This is amazing
how do you have that much money XD
I crashed my truck when I was off-roading... I have a good reason also. I lost a game that's why
That needs to be lifted and big wheels that's a off road beast
Lift kit then take it to the dunes
Ferrari really is a great value lambo lmaoo junk
Yall really know how to get yalls point across
Try throwing a sink at it!
wtf did i just watch?
Make a vid about that nice Icon fj in the back
probably banned from ferrari
pov me in forza horizon
Ok Cody I think what will throw this over the edge is a custom wrap, wyt?
Who else was expecting Ferrari to comment on this video?

Forza horizon 6 looks amazing dude
Das ist das beste beispiel das Amerika ohne ende dumme Menschen hat
i hate it and i love it too
instead of producing such fucked up videos, you guys should have spend this money e.g. for peoplpe who are struggeling each day to make it thougth their life. Sorry in my opinon a real asshole video!
Absolute mad lads!
Oh boy this hurts to watch
what a dumy you are going to end up poor
Owning a Ferrari is like owning a pet, you have to respect and appreciate it. By destroying or customizing it is almost like abusing an animal. If you cant follow these simple rules, get a Lamborghini then.
this guy is living in forza horizon
Polish road test😂
when i buy ferrari im gonna use that ferrari as i like and if the company doesnt like it its their problem they have my money and i have their car if they sue me then they give me my money for the car and i return the car its that simple

save money not to waste the money  give some money to charity it would be so grateful and dont waste money if you have a company or school hire some teachers or employees we are having so much dept and your wasting money for destroying supercars and useful things dont do this
Has anyone noticed, Cody (WD) looks a-lot, I mean a-lot like Colton Harris. Even the way Colton H show boated when on the run………hmmm.  14 in 2010 so    2023….27 years old……Cody how old are ya, i was 24 when my hair started to thin out……..  I swear it makes sense because 1.4 mill was what his Colton Harris’s story was bought for and all the $$$ went to paying off 67 Felon charges and  served 6 years in the pen………no judgement at all but dam that be a hell of a story/ride….. growing up driving stolen mecedies and bmw’s and living on your own since 13……..and travaling across the continent stealing airplanes and flying to cuba where it finally ended…….  Hmmm.
This video was hard to watch
It's pretty fucked up how your making money destroying cars most people dream of. It's a snobby flex if you ask me
Omg toyota supra

Rich people shit bro......😂
Now take a Mercedes G-Wagon replace it with tiny tires, give it a fat suspension raise and then only after cutting the top off of it go mudbogging with a wild tune as well. I was dying the whole time. First WistlinDiesel video I've seen since you came up in my feed. Now I am subscribed.
Cant even imagine how is it possible that a L like you has millions of subscribers...sick society we live in.
Forza Horizon 6
First word, with video title in mind was, (Please) "Don't" alot of love and passion went into this limited edition collectable.. someone could have appreciated this car for the rest of their life
First word that comes to mind when you say Ferrari?  I think of trash   This video makes me happy seeing you destroy a Ferrari thank you absolutely for making my day

I too hate  ferrari
Dont worry guys he have lots of money 🤑🤑🤑
Feel like this was more of an Ad
Me when I play forza
Lambo cover on a Ferrari 😂😂😂
HeavyD cant touch this shit. No chance.
You can laugh now and make money on this , but your day of reckoning will come.  Then, only then , maybe you will regret . Enjoy
I wasn’t sure if I was on board with this video until you smashed through the gate with the Rarri. Great stuff💯😆
I lost it when he drew on the emblem 😂😂😂
I SEE SUPRA IN 4:45
can't wait til i see a video and hear "Impact Detected.. calling emergency services" LOL
Soooo did you get sued?
bro just sold the cover companies entire stock for the next year
what a waste
It literally takes anything you can throw at it. Where is that location? West Virginia / Tennessee mountains or something? Gorgeous.
I feel like you want to get sued by Ferrari
then im just going to transition my weight onto the roof,  gently so i don't dent it lmao. Cody you came along way, from destroying trucks to destroying Ferrari, not no fake clickbaiter and from the country, so these material items don't mean shit to a real country down to heart type of guy. I love your channel, great job pissing off those at Ferrari sitting on billions while homeless people strave..
Okay, this dude is a knucklehead but I LOL'd at the very end when they threw all that shit at the car in the bubble. Too damn funny.
Its sad that some idiot break something good, just for klicks! Period!
4:20 the supra...
as an italian,im very glad someone said "its very scary" driving a ferrari,must be that they are doing good their job ,really proud
my heart is racing while watching this  i could cry

😅😅😅 $$$$$$$$$10 Jftduvnjjjvgcgggjthgx
I dont think ferrari is happy about this
Nope. I draw the line. Just unnecessary and infantile
As much as it hurts me to say this, you should have done this with a used Koenigsegg.  I understand the lawsuit aspect nd shit with Ferrari, but have you seen the torture tests that Koenigsegg puts their cars through? It's INSANE it's basically the fuckin hilux videos all in 1 😂😂
Reminds me of the film Harold and Maude where Harold takes a blowtorch to his brand new Jag.
This video feels like a Nightmare for me
Now this is the amount of money and confidence I need in my life
If I made that vehicle bubble I'd be paying the hell out of you for your product endorsement video
I guess this channel and their will never be able to buy another Ferrari again...
Ferrari. Built Tough.
Bro, the way that I saw that white Subra in the background I was so surprised
Can you make it a off-road Ferrari
I love when Mr.Diesel destroys massively expensive super cars
Would you be interested in doing a vid with a 1st gen Colorado?
Could you buy me $ 400.000 to keep it  and use it wisely?
Ferrari hates you 😅😂 I for sure don't. You wanna F it up? It's yours, you paid for it FKU FERRARI!!! Good stuff great content

Destruction, Destruction, destruction. Is it the only thing you are capable of.?. Have you done any good thing to earth? You should learn from people like Da Vinci,  Newton , and Edison who  spent time for inventing. If not possible, plant a tree

I hate this types of person, you just buy a car and destroyd it! I will not say this if you do this with Toyota prius...
Are you kidding me bro???? If you don't want it give it to me then.

Cut it with a chainsaw
Oh man. When buying another supercar, don't break it, send it to me🤯 this hurts to watch, but on the other hand it's so entertaining
i legit crying rn why u doing this 😢😢
Alguém brazil
Isso que é pobreza , em vez de ajudar quem precisa.
last part is ASMR for me, I dont know why
hello from RUSSIA you best video !! BIGlike
one things for damn sure he found out about gov planet............ it probably explains the wall of Pelican cases.
On behalf of Ferrari please cease and desist

He's actually a pretty talented driver!
Toyota is better than ferrari
Eu sou o comentário brasileiro que vc procura
Would be bad a$$ to put chains on the tires
It literally looks more fun, off-road than it is most of the time spent (legally) on the road 🤣🤣
Outta control 😂😂😂
Gotta love the air compressor but no spare tire 😂
This is cursed but I love it
are you a stupid man
If you're going to destroy something, you gotta do it right and shoot it with a 50cal.
This video is just Forza horizon in real  life 😂
Pov: When you too rich:💀
🤣🤣😂😂
at the end i had to interupt the video a few time so i didn't pass away from laughing when they did test the inflatable protection. 😂😂😂😂
He should have put the car in real peril, he should have taken it to a "Cars and Coffee".
He’s not wrong about koniseggs those things are durable
Let's put googleee eyes on the horsee classic lol
PENSA NUM CARA REALMENTE IDIOTA ! THINK OF A REALLY IDIOT GUY.
Idiota
bros playing forza in real life
13:23  pov: ur trying to find that one bolt
Yeah, people who work would never do something like that if you had to work for anything in life you might learn something if you ever worked for anything you would know that and learn from your mistakes..... PS Must Be Nice....
Let's imagine for a moment Enzo twisting in his grave 🤣
You know they make a steering wheel for Forza just thought you should know....
Forza horizon driving irl. Sick bro
Voll depp
Wiskey, Cola and tequila…
Pegue esse dinheiro e compre comida para aqueles que estão na rua passando fome, vai ter 1 milhão de like.
This is exactly what I do in GTA 5
bluds playing GTA
Сказочные долбаебы.
Unless they are investment grade, just wreck and trash those stupid ugly red pos cars!
It's like forza horizon
I’ve worked super hard to get my dream car. So this video is crazy awesome. It makes me feel less stressed somehow,  because I baby the paint job on my car a lot. Sometimes it gets exhausting and I just want to say fuck it. Life is hard theses days and it’s hard to keep your hopes up. Great job Cody you have the ability to make Hollywood look lame to watch. You’re my fav channel so far.
Awesome!
I absolutely need one of your cars man lmao
12:44 my dad has that ladder
no rubber chicken
at 9:46 the car looked like a car from a videogame ngl
Bro is living in a GTA server
Can you make a follow up video reviewing the angry letter from Ferrari?
Honestly, what a shitty video... Not even worth the "dislike".
Listen here Ferrari. That shot of the car drifting down a muddy hill in the rain while the lightning flashed and thunder cracked may just have been the sexiest 5 seconds of car video I have seen in my life. I've never wanted a Ferrari more than during those 5 seconds. You better praise this man for getting you that footage.
ferrari looks so hot wtf
how did he get the money tho
Será que ele contribui pra alguma organização que atende os pobres e necessitados,bom o dinheiro é dele e faz o que quer isso vai ter um preço
like so many people starving and in need of help... there is a sucker who demonstrates enormous arrogance and demands his fortunes. donate your money to those who really need it. With this futile and empty behavior, your passport when you die, it's straight to hell, non-stop.
I think it's safe to say that that car cover would protect the Ferrari from anything except a crazy woman😂😂😂😂
Imbecil vsi ajudar os pobres
Valeu d+
I think it should be an advert for Ferrari. Who would know that italian P.O.S. could resist to these kind of treatment?
I from brazil,dude you is Crazy 🤯🤯.i need a car!!!!?!
Idiota
Tenho uma missão  para vocês  pegue um caça americano  vá  até  a Antártica  e colida com aquelas parede de gelo. Kkkkkko😂
Grandes idiotas!!!!😂
We get it you have money
😂😂😂😂😂😂😱😱😱😱🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Instead of destroying a beautiful car you should donate it to me
and you didn't.......... lol
I just wish i had half your money lol be so cool to mess up cars and get paid for it lol
Rallyrari. Farally
I know that most people see that these types of vids are completely stupid. But we should at least give props to WhistlinDiesel for having the the balls to take really expensive vehicles and destroy them.
Well, it seems quite durable!!
Thats how you use ferrari
The badass marketing that not many youtubers can conduct....
@Ferrari
Great filming!!!
Nothing new for FH5 fans
Prova fare la stessa prova con la PUROSANGUE ?

Taki wspaniały samochód,  aż serce pęka,  mogliście mi go dać zamiast go tak traktować
Idiot, more money than sense.
Ferrari's legal Team - We've got ehm boys.
What's in all his cases on the side of the garage stacked up high? Rpg's?
какое то говнище  ! Это понты ? или какой смысл ?
So this dude replied to a comment that had 2 likes?? It bothered him that bad? It was 5 mins old btw. He sits by the comments and waits for someone to call him broke so he can flex some cash. You can be rich, famous, popular, all that good shit but deep down you know what you're hiding. Listen to his talk and the way he walks. When the viewers go down, he'll transition I almost guarantee it. Or at least he'll come out
Very entertaining. Awesome to see a Ferrari go off road but I have to say that with so few models built, its really a shame to wreck a Ferrari.
My ferarry in gta5 hhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
That beat at the end of the video was lwokey fire.
why just give it to me
видос какашка инет бабах
So?
had no idea ferrari was such a whiny baby lol
I’m glad he’s taking his health seriously, a militay uniform and help to go along with it 👍
Виски кола и текила

AH ! To be young and so STUPID !!
People like that don't deserve to have what they have
That bubble thing was amazing... I need one of those. I'm in Florida and we get a lot of hurricanes and hail. Yeah, if a tree/house falls on it, that's not going do anything, but in my area, I'm mostly worried about debris (branches, flying garbage cans, hail).
can you give me a car for free pleaaaas
😁
As an american I see shit like this then immediately think of homeless people
Noooooo I am Italian
You threw everything at it but the kitchen sink. That was freaking awesome! Now to put 37's on it.

not me messing around in Forza Horizon 5
:Me at forza horizon:  :D
I just love you and your crew your channel is so Awesome.
Whistling diesel is now just tax the rich.
***** HERE is a GOOD IDEA*****    ***** Just to piss off Ferrari and their ''cease and desist'' culture of snobism , you, WhislinDiesel, could, if you want, organise a huge demolition derby with HeavyDSpaks and all his friends, maybe MattsOffRoad and his friends, and give off maybe half the proceeds to a charity event, so still make good money to pay off the ferrari AND give to charity. The charity would ward off possible backlash from ferrarris snobs... give them a good ol American lesson of humility, make a bit of money and give to a good cause AND utterly destroy a Ferrary beyond repair, who knows after the demolition maybe BLOW UP the ''Ferreakage'' to hell in a last standing ovation... Guarenteed Lots of views!!!! (ps. I have my own private think tank and love to give out Ideas)
Is the scream at the end Nico Bellic ? XD

Man just fuck you, one day god is gonna take all of this from you and make you need a dollar just to drink water.
*Ed Bolian has entered the chat*
This is hilarious
Definitely just made the best advertisement for that balloon protection

Ferrari Is the most pretentious cunt brand on the planet. They better hope I don’t have fuck you money in the future. 😂 I won’t destroy it but I will waste your time and money in legal fees trying to take me to court 😂
Bros just playing forza horizon
Quit being a pussy and drive it off a cliff. No balls
Congrats on your success. However I would not buy you a beer because you clearly never once did anything on God's green earth to earn what you have. If you had, you wouldn't destroy things for hotube money. They say our politicians are out of touch but you are no where near ground level. Atleast mr beast does good for others. What do you do except destroy and act a fool? Your money clearly defines your character more than you.
As a forza 5 player it's fun to watch someone in real life destroy a high end car like this lll
Você e de mais❤
So uncool und unlustig uff wie kann man so sein weißt du nicht mehr wohin mit dein scheiß Geld oder warum machst du sowas mit deinen Autos
bro just give me the car next time

👎🏻👎🏻
How does it not pain him to do this to such a beautiful car
Forza horizon in a nutshell
In the 2000s, they destroyed playstations and iphones, in the 2020s, they destroyed teslas and ferraris, in the 2040s, the wealthy became so wealthy they just started burning down entire neighborhoods for the lulz
on 13:20 where it begins it was so funny that I was falling of my chair🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂
Waste of money
i love the fact they take 6 figure cars and destroy them without a care in the world, so devious 💀
I think Ferrari wanted him to do this, that’s why they sold it to him.
There had to be 10 people throwing shit at that car
Bro this mf does with his cars what i do with mine in need for speed but irl
O no
I love your videos but I had a hard time watching this one. theres just this unique atmosphere surrounding Ferraris. almost sacred like.

Why did youtube demonetize this video? Can someone explain?
Destroying his 400.000$ car while im here barely having food on my table😢
Very nice car
Wish I could just get quarter the money you pay for that car 🙏
Total lack of respect for the people who worked hard to design and build that car by their hands.
i think an interesting idea for a challenge would be to try to split a vehicle into two seperate pieces by driving at full speed into something like a tree but maybe a sharp tree? so the vehicle would be split down the middle and into two pieces potentially...make sense? long ways like hot dog style...i would literally shit if you were actually able to accomplish a full split...good luck. challenge worthy of accepting? like this comment if you would like to see this....
This is the shit people want to see, damn you are the reincarnation of Top Gear back in the day!
You need to put a Lamborghini Urus on big tires and test it off-road. 😂
Such a bad example for the young generation.
Lost all respect for you
You should actually by a real rally car and drive it like a sport car
Does anybody know where to buy those green and gray containers he has stacked up against the wall
Am I the only one here who's glad he didn't completely destroy that shit?
whaaaaaaaatttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! buy a lamborgini to do a crash test with it
Cease and desist will defo be on the way 🤣 I’m no hater , love the early vids you done but to destroy this is a bit “scummy” and obnoxious.
I didn't laugh that loud 😂 for a while 🤣🤣
it hurts
The new forza horizon looks great
If anything this promotional video for Ferrari showing how durable it is and that car cover😂

So has Ferrari sued you yet?
Hey @WhistlinDiesel , try getting the fastest time: https://youtube.com/video/BgLJCDuYzaA
wow, It´s incridible, I have been following your channel directly from Africa, Mozambique and I think it´s really amaizing. my dream is to have  a car one day, it could not be a very expensive one but just a car, like a Toyota Mark-X, Runx, Allex or Lexus.
Why should the company sue them I mean THEY BOUGHT THAT FERRARI FOR 400K ITS THEIRS RIGHTFULLY
White trash with money = Whitetrash.
I really don’t understand this generation, honestly. This dude gets even richer by destroying expensive toys most of his fans could never afford. Another rich talentless idiot going platinum on YouTube.Brilliant.
You’re actually in a gta server
GTA irl Y0
You should tow your truck and trailer with it to keep the miles of your truck
An office grunt here enjoying the 1% playing stuff getting trashed....
What a satisfying watch, get absolutely fuck Ferrari!
some ppl dont have  a car
So just another low IQ, view hungry, degenerate, rich prick with no gratitude for his success, and no value for what people work their whole life for, getting all his admiration from a shameless, arrogant, proud, failed western generation that knows no meaning to appreciating your blessings…… All you wanna see is money being misused by a grown spoiled trust fund toddler who would only justify this by saying “it’s my toy!!”…….. this is what happens when people haven’t had to struggle and fight for their success
he revealed it with a lambo huracan cover 😂
I am both cringing at the destruction of this masterpiece and yet so glad that people are acctualy using their high end cars

Bros playing forza irl
this is one of those videos that just make me wonder...
Morry
now this is forza horizon irl
I understand why people would paint it like a cat it purrs like a cat 😂 5:10
I haven't seen anyone destroy anything.  This looks like a fake destruction.  Everything looks fake and set up.  In fact, he is taking great care that the car does not suffer permanent damage.  It even looks like Ferrari marketing.
GTA5 xD
Come I have your g wagon
have you ever ben in a car crash
I understand why Ferrari keep a close eye on who they sell cars too. This was blasphemous
It's Forza Horizon 6?!
Brilliant!
My  friend recommended this channel. And I love it!
looks good on grass
Wait I actually want that car cover. Where can I buy it?
Destroying a ferrari... oh fuck yeah!
Give me one million dollar from nepal😅
This video gave me wrench fight vibes
Não achei nada engraçado. Uma verdadeira palhaçada. Seria melhor vender e ajudar as Crianças da África do Sul.  Teste bobo!!! 🤪🙄🤨😬😨😭😡😡😡
Is this guy for real? N
Lol😂😂 next you wanna buy my $100,000 dollar motorcycle
I think of danger with you. I know im one to talk but you need to be way more safer man. You have had so many close calls or that was some crazy photo shop or whatever but ya please be more cafefull. From run away wheels to playing with a excavator you name it. As much as I hate seeing a nice toyota be run to shitt it is interesting to see a real durablity test. That was my favorite video of you man. That Toyota hilex really impressed me. They just make stuff like that anymore so you have to make em yourself witch is cool cuz still. I heard that you shouldent even jump start ferrari lol whats the point why have it like that.
😂😂😂
Speedrun how to get Ferrari blacklisted
Pretty cool to see the "bubble" scene on Ozzyman reviews channel...
Very crazy !!
If we can do more stuff with that bubble around the car that would be so fun
Why you don't spend the 400,000 to the children who were hungry or sick instead of wasting for nothing?
how does he get the monney lol, fun video btw
Виски кола и текила...
Well, if you, have, the extreme necessity to SHOW YOUR FACE... Congratulation. Stupid case? Judge for Yourself. Nice day!
Me lembrou o gta
This is exactly how I played forza horizon back in the day
Uai mn me dá ela…já que tá fácil assim rebenta o carro ua…manda ela aí pra mim aqui no Brasil de rocha memo !
Ahaha it's T all over the tiktok scattered
I think it would have been awesome if he would have driven to a 5 Star Dinner or somewhere hella expensive with the mudded ferrari
i love that ferrari 😭😭 you monster why ferrari
You've got something in your head that's not dirty and you're a stupid, spoiled brat, you fit the car
Oh I know that garage you bought hoovies car eh?
How sad 😢😢😢poor ferrari
I'm starting to think this guy is not materialistic
F Ferr4ir1😂😂❤
Ferrari be like : " I love this guy, don't ban him " 😂😂
i can’t even do that in a game and he does is in irl
Well now I know forza horizon is more realistic then I thought 🤷‍♂️
car bubble guys are like fuck yeah
This is literally me driving in Forza Horizon, driving expensive exotic cars into grass and open fields and kicking up mud.
Yep, I'm buying a Ferrari
Try to sue him after this video and they're digging their own grave 🎯
Ferrari  Brand worth $48Bil, Lamborghini Brand worth $350Mil I dont get it.
Good
Man, u are crazy 😂😂
Nossa que legal o que mais ele sabe fazer ? Será que ele tem 6 X esse valor pra ir em um país onde a fome é extrema e cuidar de seres humanos? Ele não sabe ele prefere destruir um brinquedo para provocar o fabricante,  ele não tem essa grana toda nem cérebro para ajudar pessoas só a ideia infantil de destruir um brinquedo caro,  maturidade nenhuma. Pobretão.
GTA6
Guy who does that kind of thing is a asshole !
i hope he actually takes care of this car
Hey whistleindiesel, i wanna work with you.
Agora eu gosto dos carros da Ferrari mais ainda, são bons de terra tbm 🇧🇷😂😂😂
you´re dumb and shouldn´t be allowed to have nice things
Eu sou o comentário BR que tanto você procura!
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅❤
reminds me of forza horizon
O carro continua íntegro...da pra vender por 400 de novo👍
DUDE THE CAR IS FERRARI AND THE COVER IS A LAMBORGHINI
Mano eu não quis acreditar que ela subiu aquelo morro cheio de grama. Um carro comum teria parado no começo por causa da grama.  O cara forçou é o carro aí da aguentou kkkkkkkk  Mas eu acho que ele nem judiou tanto assim.
You want a war  mdfkr  scun
4:38 was that guy legit pissed off ?
You’re a spoiled kid
Why? Really? Donate your money to help people who are hungry or to some non-profit organization, such as MSF.
Crazy
Viva o capitalismo
De dónde saca la plata el pelotudo este para romper todo? Increíble que ese país sea potencia.
You should see if it’ll water skip like that old Lamborghini a video on Lamborghini first came out lol 😂
I love it, but  I also hate it.😅 if you know what I mean
Brasil aqui ❤
I guarantee that’s the last time they’ll let you buy a Ferrari 🤣
Quanto dinheiro disperdiçado é até pecado fazer isso. Só queria arrumar meus dentes 😔 Me ajuda aí mano 🙏
why does it seem s€xy af when the ferari drifts
Me in a nutshell on Forza Horizon 5
Com os $400,000 faz doação pra casa de acolhimento Animal, ajudar pessoas que estão em extrema pobreza 😢
Put Off-Road wheels on it.
The only bull is meh brurrrrrR ah. Clearly you z misunderstood.
Hey honey. Honey baby. Sweet ums. Daddy and mommy's little cupcake. Just wanted to, you know, tell you that you are under arrest for impersonating someone clearly better than you, stronger than you, smarter than you, richer than you. Look cupcake, everyone up here and around here is cheering you on.

So I really hate you, but I do like watching your videos because I get to see rare cars get destroyed so I know how strong they are, maybe try fixing rare cars afterwards and selling them.
STAHP

Can't wait to see him destroy a Bugatti
The trail looks EXACTLY like the trail I run on

Wey que coraje alv
pov: me in forza
Imagine getting sued for a car you paid your hard earned money for. Nah that's just crazy. If you're so sensitive about your car, DON'T SELL EM!
Ferrari inadvertently made a modern two wheel driver rally car; and they’re going to be mad someone figured it out?
Que Coisa Ridícula !!!
Co za łeb
YO WHERE CAN I GET THAT CAR BUBBLE
Just a nobody with a lack of respect and to much money. OMG
Brazil 🇧🇷
Destroying one of the most important cars in the most beautiful world, could have sold it and helped people in Africa who are starving, for sure it will gain much more followers,
i need to buy a cart in the range of r$ 10,000, to help the most needy people here in Brazil, Illuminati with crazy doing this, could be sued, destroy one of the bad brands
The lambo cover at the start....👏😂
Gotta work hard for that money, I guess. Work the right word?
Can you please not say Lamborghini or Ferrari correct. Say Lambrotinnie. Or Fernariii
so much pain
Para pessoas normais, ele apenas demonstrou a robustez de um supercarro, capaz não só de rodar em asfaltos de primeira classe quanto em qualquer terreno sem ser um QT!
Mostra toda a imaturidade de um pivete que faz de tudo para aparecer, mas somente convence a outros idiotas iguais a ele, faria o mesmo a um Rolls Royce se o mesmo fosse o sonho de consumo que é uma Ferrari!
If get to destroy it fully, then take the engine and make an aircraft out of it
Где можно посмотреть на русском?
And to think about those ferrari drivers that manage to crash n total, driving along a straight paved road.
hey I'm your biggest hater why are you destroying that poor ferrari think about so many people wants ferrari but they can't buy because they don't have any money
What a dumb and idiot animal!

Precisam fabricar Ferraris mais caras pra evitar esse tipo de situação.
His driving is how I drive in forza horizon 5 😭💀
Почему его видосы не 18+? Или "не для слабонервных"? Сердце рвется от вида этих издевательств😭
Can you send me 100k $?

Maravlha.....
Half the video i was praying for the safety of the ferrari
Solo me imagino a los fans y a los ejecutivos de ferrari retorciéndose de dolor al ver este video
the end of this one is nutty funny
The back words magnum PI Rockford was priceless
sell the car and money to poor children.  Vende o carro e doe dinheiro a crianças com fome...
On The start there is Lamborghini logo instead Ferrari
Os otários seguidores de influencer, já pagam esse divertido prejuízo.. isso mostra o quanto vivemos num mundo de desigualdade
The last Ferrari he will ever own.
O verdadeiro babaca
Hello From Ukraine guys <3
You need to re-run this video when you've got your Chieftain Tank, that should sort the Ferrari out!!
Классная защита от повреждений😅
*causually puts $400,000 car on rally terrain.
This is literally the best ad video that the car protector balloon thingy could use. Dang.
Forza be like:
I was waiting for the kitchen sink
Achei o vídeo um pouco bobo. A única coisa que concordei foi quando ele falou que ela não foi feita pra area rural(Estrada de terra) Não precisa de muita coisa pra chegar nessa conclusão, só olhar para o carro. Até que as estradas da área rural dele estavam boas, pois enrosca se tiver buracos igual as estradas aqui.
Forza en la vida real
just give me the wreck so i can sell it and feed my kids
Bravo shum makin e mir dhe e fort😂✌🏼
😅😅😅😅
É por isto que os americanos são conhecidos no mundo como idiotas,só fazem coisas idiotas para chamar atenção 😂😂😂
Idiot

Nahhhh bros livin in forza💀💀
I love you man, no homo
Ohhh my goshhhhh (laughs)  Ohhhh myyyyyyy. Definition of assholes level god
Idiotas
Patético ridículo .
Why???
If you buy a car, it’s your motherfucking car. Ferrari is a bitch ass hoe. If they think they can tell you what to do, and how you paint your fucking car
can we just talk about all the rare car in the background
You could have used that Ferrari money to feed starving children. But that video would have been boring as hell
😂😂😂😂😂👏😍👏😍👏🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
F*ck Ferrari. Ugliest cars in the world, no soul, arrogant management... Lamborghini and Porsche all day ❤
Eliot works for the IRS
Eliot said thats my Car now pay up
Wow, very good content, I am really amazed, so amazed actually I finally subscribed, well done Cody😁👍🏻
I mean, his money, his car, he can do whatever he wants, I don't see how can ferrari sue him because he is destroying his own car🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Your content is great. I hope you don't get in trouble with Ferrari. I see your content as useful info. I'd like to see what you are capable of doing with a jeep gladiator mojave. ✌️
your so not a good person you idion trying tho destroy a ferrairi you idion you suck at youtube
Forza horizon 5 but in real life 😂😂
I hope one day this guy'll afford to buy Koenigsegg just to destroy it
I'd rather give homeless children 10 years for me but i think it's a bitch
You know what makes these channels do awesome is that he does the s*** that we all wish we could do

Youre a fucking retardade and do a realy good comercial for ferrari... assrole 😂
Cease and desist letter? Bruh if you paid for the whole car you use the whole car 💀
Just install the ladder over the car's roof, it'll instantly boost power by 300bhp.
O comentário brasileiro que você estava procurando.
Please just crash it into a tree!
Bottom line: don't use Ferrari when on dirt. Buy the bubbly thing to protect it. Thank you! 😅
Um babaca
Viva o mói
Ferrari be shitting bricks the entire duration of this vid 😂
Very resistent car... I wasnt expecting for It
Clickbait. He didn’t actually destroyed the car. Car seems pretty whole to say the least

The dude is playing GTA irl and is on a 5 star chase with Ferrari
Instead destroying car, why u dont give your money to the poor ?
What the f*** are you doing please don't tell me you were going to destroy that Ferrari the cost like $400,000
Vc é um idiota, o mundo está cada vez pior por conta de pessoas como você, que fazem tudo por like
Well what's in all those pelican cases behind the Ferrari?
That cameraman really trusts cody’s nutty driving..
This country has the use sold sold on if you don't know how to do it first without practice then you're just never going to get it practice makes perfect that is the only way you ever figure out anyting
The only thing I fear is you're going to be the person that is going to say oh no no let me do it only I can do it that's what I fear and that my friend is where your freedom gets taken away because even though I know if you practice something over and over and over and over again you become a master
These video screen freedom on top of people literally going to Kentucky and screaming for less freedom people literally saying take my rights away I don't want them anymore
I love it because these videos say freedom these videos scream freedom
I really like how you're showing the difference of leftist views vs. Just people with common sense
I missed the part where he destroys it.
I never saw something so stupid... A spoiled boy, telling to everyone here, that he has U$ 400.000,00 to destroy... I guess this kid need a lesson to learn how to respect money
@renatogarciayt
I know "Europe- Dumb" But I was not prepared for "US- Dumb"  Anyways- Klicks are klicks.

One more stupid American! Sick people who do everything for a like! Burn in Hell, retarded!
Dear @whistlindiesel ferarri would be MOST upset if u gave the now used F8 to a single parent NOT rich dad of 3 awesome daughters!!! See they need RICH BACHELORS driving their Ferraris for the image, a single parent dad trying to provide for my daughters dropping them off at Cheerleading in a “slightly used” F8 & Parking it outside my rented average 1980 built home, in the weather is NOT the image ferarri wants for their F8. If you want to REALLY. Piss them off,..im happy to be the Guinea pig ,..for social media science sake of course. 👍👍 id be happy to take on any of your “used” vehicles for any purpose, destroyed or not, the Toyota, the G63 AMG Moab destruction (I live in utah 😉) my daughters have a little channel and man they’d be stoked to get taken to cheer everyday in your bad ass slightly bashed/used G wagon with 1 wheel drive Orrrr the ferarri when it’s destroyed ? Paleaaase 🙏
I buy this Ferrari for one dollar and you still deliver in Brazil
Kkkkkkkkkkkkk       #dgtudo
That's just stupid. Feel sorry for child with money. $400K into trash, should support homeless kid and single parents or any other people.
Still waiting on a Ferrari response...?
I was waiting the moment to laugh ! Where is it  ?  U Just proove  that  ferrari is way better  that anyone  could imaging .
@ferrari
Forza Horizon real
Desnecessário, feito pra chamar atenção, e humilhar a marca. Falta a Ferrari se posicionar.
I am totally amazed to know that an imbecile like this has any followers!!
Não destruiu Ferrari nenhuma. Só alguns arranhões na pintura e uns pedregulhos
Joga a Ferrari aqui pra mim!!!! Oh loco....
Ferrari be like - now u r band for buying any Ferrari ......🤣🤣🤣🤣
😂😂😂😂
Isso que eu chamo de um video milionario kkkkk Show🎉🎉🎉🎉...
Porque você não doa esse dinheiro $ todo para pessoas que tem fome no Mundo... seria melhor
Chamar de imbecil é um elogio. Pela cara da pra ver que é um débil mental. 💩🖕🏼
Estrada de terra la e melhor que o asfalto aqui no Brasil kkkkkkkkkkk
whiskey cola i tequila bagnananananagnanaiii
Milhões de gente passando fome, e este cara rasgando dinheiro... Tivesse doado faria muita gente feliz
Quantas pessoas no mundo pode comprar um carro desse?
Off-roading in a Ferrari at night with military spec night vision goggles would be good haha
bros drivin like he in forza DX
Ele faz isso pq ele nasceu com tudo nas mãos,se ele tivesse q batalha trabalhando duro pra comprar um faria isto,pq não vende a Ferrari e faz doação pra hospitais e pessoas necessitadas,por muita coisa parecida com isso o mundo e as pessoas tão cada vez pior,o Neymar da seleção brasileira perdeu 5 milhões d bobeira ao vivo e fico zoando,quero ver aonde isso vão leva eles futuramente enbajando ao envez d ajuda o próximo,os cara se acham fazendo noiagems,isso é um mundo sem volta, pq ele não pega e não bate numa parede forte d frente com a Ferraripra ver se ela aguenta a paulada  se ele sobrevive
I hate myself for watching this
He could give it to me
armer ferrari
This man will be the next Mrbeast but at destroying things.
Mundo tá foda.
No minimo esse homem não tem o que fazer.
Idiota
Poxa Man, manda pra mim o resto dela

All BS aside,  that full send @10:00 was textbook.

Maluco tá fazendo na vida real o q geral faz no GTA V kkkkkkkkkk
Bem feito para Ferrari que se acha a exclusiva.

Quanta inutilidade!?
definitely want to see this Ferrari getting squatted
Nossa 10% do valor desse carro mudaria minha vida e o cara destrói 😮😮😮
Diggin those wheels. Want some like that for my sandrail
Isso prova que você pode ter dinheiro e não ser inteligente
They should call that car the "Sink" with its built in drain.
Enzo turning in his grave
How much idiocy in one video, shame on you.
Ok, but it's a secondhand car, Ferrari won't bother.
Every day I am more surprised by the ability of human beings to be more and more stupid and the ability of other idiots to appreciate this stupidity that surpasses the limit of infinity...😂   😂
man is literally banning himself from ferrari for a video, man of legend
Idiot.
Ao invés de comprar um carro tão caro e destruir, deveria fazer algo realmente necessário, ajudar pessoas que realmente precisam de ajuda, tanto dinheiro jogado fora ,sem o mínimo de amor só próximo, esses yotubers só pensam em se aparecer, também nunca passaram fome na vida pra saber o quanto é difícil conseguir dinheiro pra se alimentar, e ficam fazendo vídeos bacanas para idiotas como eles ver.
Mas como tem gente besta nesse mundo. Tivesse doado o dinheiro para um hospital infantil e quantas crianças seriam alcançadas. Quanto coisa boa e útil poderia ser feita com uma quantia dessas. Digno de pena só mostra como o ser humano anda desprezível!
Craigslist be like, low miles Ferrari been babied all it’s life. Tons of mods.
Acho que é o único vídeo que realmente foi quebrando uma Ferrari. Já vi gente jogando tijolo de isopor no vidro
Isto é um babaca ,quantas pessoas não sonha em ter um carro deste !
It’s funny how it say’s Lamborghini 0:41
Did ferrari sue? Lol
pointless
I like you
dude out here playin real life forza horizons
Adorei esse video! Ser dono e tratar uma Ferrari com desprezo é muito prazeroso. Isso é uma bela resposta para a arrogante Ferrari Company 😊
Kids at starving but yeah let's destroy a Ferrari
Hate this guy right about now
this is by far the biggest waste of money spent ive ever seen "please keep thinking
What is the need for this young man??
This is going to get so famous 🎉

You threw everything at the balloon except for the kitchen sink
Como eu vim parar aqui? 😮

The sound of Ferrari is like p*rn
🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️

God I'd like to see the dislike amount right now...

Istead of destroying it, you can just give it to me and make my life better.
But the ferrari was not destroyed... 🤷🏼‍♂️
Mit jeden klick isr der Ferrari bezahlt
Nunca vi um cara tão idiota....
nawww man this hurts

😂😂😂😂😂😂
Eu querendo dinheiro pra comprar uma casa e o amigo destruindo uma Ferrari...
That is probably the first Ferrari in the hills of Indiana off roading . 247 years
Babaca desde ter doado o dinheiro que gastou com Ferrari teria ganhando mais seguidores

"os idiotas vão dominar o mundo, não pela inteligência, mas sim pela quantidade"
Idiota........

In Germany we said: du spast du Idiot du respektierst nicht den Geist und die Seele eines Automobiles und lösch dich du Dummkopf....ich hoffe du wirst wegen Dummheit gesperrt 😅so viel Geld und so ein schönes Auto echt schäm dich wie kann man so schonungslos mit einem Auto umgehen 😢 aber daran erkennt man dass du nicht dafür gearbeitet hast sondern nur paar Videos hochgeladen und Glück hattest
All the little Ferrari queers big mad 🤣😂
That's a pitiful and ridiculous attitude! And it's not because the Ferrari itself, but because of the imbecibility of someone who takes pleasure in destroying a masterpiece made by people passionate about what they do! Unfortunately there are a lot of people who like videos like this. I had to see it with my own eyes to believe! 😢
PARABÉNS 👏🔝 VOCÊ TEM QUE VIR AQUI AO BRASIL 🇧🇷🇧🇷  VAI SER MUITO BEM VINDO 😉✌️👊🇧🇷🇧🇷
Too much unearned income by the looks of him.
From INDIA❤
Российский мем

Talk about throwing everything at it but the kitchen sink lol i’m pretty sure the kitchen sink would’ve made it through the Ferrari’s bubble 😂😂🤣
Forza Horizon in real life
Fucking love this guy 😂
@ferrari
this triggers me becuase im poor asf
ferrari can say its wistlin diesel proof lol
a sad waste of skin not funny
Guy plays FORZA in real life
I was not expecting to laugh that much. I imagine a Ferrari fan telling : ''You can't do this to a Ferrari man, and Whistlingdiesel answering : Yes I can, I just did''
See if it will float on water with the bubble 🤔
I can’t wait for part 2. F this Ferrari.
Any other brand and I’d be pissed but Ferrari deserves this for suing everyone
you have 5.08M subscribers but i still think your underrated
Wtf..
“Unfortunately we lost some people “ (entire cemetery)lmao this guy is such a riot 😂😂❤
Just IDIOT and your Ferrari.
U ever get that letter in the mail??
Pls give me the car 😭😭😭😭
Que vídeo idiota , tinha que ser de um americano imbecil , mais imbecil quem acha bonito isso , quer fazer algo diferente , ajude pessoas que estão passando fome  .
eyo but what does this dude do for a living? 😅
he let the intrusive thoughts win
z jednej strony jest to hejt a z drugiej reklama
thats me in forza horison
bro is using that car like its a toy
PImmel
Imagine getting sued by an architect because they didn’t like the color you paint your house! seems pretty dumb, just saying
Nothing matters 🤟
what an idiot
the new graphics of forza horizon look good !
You need to bring this car to Cletus and race it around his track
So you spent 400k on daddy's credit card to destroy a Ferrari, when you could've gone out to put 400k down on plates for people that are hungry. You are the reason as to what's wrong with this world.  Oh and you're psychopathic dead-stare gaze that you come with.
OMG  The hood scoop
USA USA USA... dumb
they are easily blacklisted by ferrari
Ngl this guy is a dumbass but this looks fun as hell 😅
Пздц бублики на феррари
"Probably gonna kill turbos"
that's a good promo video for that car cover thing, lmao
Don’t worry guys, it was just a rental.
I just started watching I love it
You should just turn that into a rally car no joke
Ты долбоеб? Только честно
that things a beast offroad wtf lol
I hate u for this
This is painful
Real Life GTA
shouldve just give me the ferrari
I’m just happy you did not actually destroy it
Forgot how much I loved WD
There are those who do everything they can to just make ends meet and give their families the best they can and then there are those who buy a Ferrari to destroy it and no longer earn money with it, it's sad you only think of yourself instead of doing something good for the poor but yes this is the unfair world and that will never change quite the opposite it will only get worse ...
WOW THE FOOLS FOOL AGAIN
You're going to end up pissing somebody off and they are going to come to your house and dump gas all over it and catch it on fire while you're in it and there won't be no getting out because they're going to screw the doors and windows shut and take special care just to make sure there's plenty of gas around the doors and windows just in case you never know where it's coming from because that's what camouflage is for it will probably end up being one of your friends or family
POV ferrari don't let you have no mor ferrari
Who's gonna be the next owner?

I don't like Ferrari but I absolutely hate these videos. He is just destroying a car a dumping it. Waste of plastics electronics. Rubber. Copper cobalt. It's just a waste.
What the actual fuck. I have never seen this channel before and he is a crazy person.
You literally take Forza Horizon title to a whole new level
That is basically me in Forza Horizon lol 😂😂😂
Do you want better grip on your tires and y’all don’t want to crash your supercar lift it and put BFG’s all-terrain tires

This car has more hp than my cars cc

I am legit impressed with how durable that car bubble is!
Throws a towel at the car DONT DO THAT proceeds to freakin' jump on the car *aggresively*
Từ top top qua 😅
Where is all the farrari mulch?
13:31 I would love for Cody to do an RC car related video. I can't think of what, but probably something destructive. Or a regular car that is controlled by a remote.
Bro let me get on a video lol
Spero ferrari no veda questo video, ti stai cercando un groso problema con questa cosa, ferrari no scherza con questo, veramente che il cavalletto rampante di maranello no veda questo video..😅
Is bro in the military or does he just wear that for fun?
he bought my dream car and just like destroyed it
You’re a fkn mutt , all for the clicks on YouTube . Go f your sekf
Calling friends to bring random shit to throw at a Ferrari
Dieser Mann ist für mich das allerletzte auf dieser Welt. Um klicks zu bekommen, tut er alles. Er hätte das Geld auch spenden können, Tieren helfen, Menschen helfen, Obdachlosen helfen oder Familien helfen, die einen geliebten Menschen verloren haben. Und was macht er ?  Wäre er ein armer Mensch, wüsste er, was Geld bedeutet. Ihm wünsche ihm nur eines... aber nichts gutes 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬 Greetings from Germany
Can I please have a car? I need one. (Make sure it’s nice)
american idiot...da war doch was
Daamn thats nice Racing car Next WRC car Ferrari :D:D
At least he don't explode it, like someone with new urus
I thought he was actually going to destroy it.

Ragazzi at Ferrari fainting while watching this.
that thing sounds fkn good tho
bro just playing forza horizon 6
I agree lift with mud tires. It'll be son of monster max
You could make my car indestructible to a zombie apocalypse or something like that, detail it's not walking at the moment I only have it, and you would have to take a trip for that, do you accept?
I can’t believe you treat these like little baby toys it’s so fun to watch
Nigga u sooo wasteful
por que  ases eso cuesta miñones 🥲😰😨😭😱🥱😫😩
The title is a bait. You don’t even destroy this thing.
My brother was walking by and just stopped at the distinct sound of the exhaust.....he just nodded his head and kept walking......LMAO.
A Ferrari sobre melhor os moro aí q a Fiat Toro e o jipe Renegade 😅
4:10 that’s not a sport suspension!!! Jesus that’s soft!
If Ferrari asks for this car back, Cody is going to neatly package it, even overnight freight it back, inside of a FedEx envelope melted down into a 4x4 cube.

So ein dummes Schwein, Alter....eigentlich hilft bei solchen Leuten nur eines
Ironically - Ferrari sues everyone to try and protect their reputation, but now their reputation is destroyed and they're only known for suing people. lol

Bro you destroying a firarri and look at the homeless guys the have 100bucks and you destroying that car

30 years ago the model for these useless cars were to get poosies, but the generation these days are using them like a go cart on steroids which is very inspirational to a 65 year old man like me. I've always hated what these cars represent. You go generation "Y"!!!

#FERRARI
Confirmed, all of his cars need to be put into bubbles to protect themselves from him. lmao
Give me a hammer 😂
This is what ferrari doing in forza horizon,but its in real life
got very intense at the end there
damages a ferrari and plays with it like it has no worth people suffer just to afford themselves a dacia while you want to wreck an f8
Plots twist. The Ferrari has PPF on it so the paint couldn’t get damaged.
You didn’t even destroy it
Dinner at 2
Заставь меня сиять, дядя
You should diesel swap it and lift it as high as monster max
I'm actually surprised how well that fucker went up that hill
This guy and 3 generations after him will not be allowed to buy a new Ferrari 😂
Surprised it took someone this long to do this with all the other destruction vids people have been making for years
Cars whe have to work for a hole life and he buy and destroys it
A lambo tarp on a Ferrari? 😂
For that being one of my dreams cars, its hard to see it get absolutely obliterated. But it was fun to watch 😂
Ferarri heaven.
When a ferarri truly feels free
When I watch Jerryrigeverything detroy a a $1400 iphone or other expensive phone I always feel sad, this guy destroys a 400k car..THIS IS INSANE!!
The muffin tray at 13:43 was unexpected
bro where do you get this money from lol
This video had so much more potential. You could have taken it to local drift event to crash into someone's $3000 Nissan S13 or an actual forest rally. Just doing donuts on grass is like regular youtube honda civic shit
bro is living forza
My question is " Why ?"
Now buy a destroyed Ferrari just to put it back together
Ferrari shouldn’t care. I mean, you bought it didn’t you? If you did, in most situation, it’s yours now and you can choose what to do with it.
Epic
Stupido americano
Now thats called content. Good shit y'all 🤙
This is probably the most painful video I’ve seen 🤣
Tbh the drive up to the top looked so good 😂
pov: your looking to see if farrari commented on his video
WTF ARE YOU DOING
Seeing this video reminded me of another youtuber TaxTheRich, who also used their car like this.
I’m glad he hasn’t changed
How many ladders do you have 😂😂😂
Did Ferrari sued you for this excelent comercial?  I never thougth a Ferrari could go up a hill like that haha
This is premium top quality content. Sick video
Rally used Ferrari first one ever and most likely last one
Douche bag.

Помогать нуждающимся. Это дело показывает человека и его поступки! А не пустой выпендрёж!!! Обрати внимание, на таких же людей на как и ты. Люди мечтают о тёплой постели. Дети не видят игрушки!
My eyesbrows rasied when i seen him getting on the hood,,thats where it started lol
im glad you didnt actually destroy it
imagine this being your first video you see from this guy with no context. I'm literally flinching as he hits the car
bro even if he bought a beat 458 that's a whole car
Kinda makes me wanna buy a Ferrari, but then again, I can’t even afford insurance on it
man.. i've never smiled so much in my life that was so fun
Dudes coming straight out of gta online with that fit and car/driving style hahah
13:20 it makes you wonder do they have a a throwing machine
Normalne podejście to tylko plastik , szkło i metal dobrze uformowane
Fucking Amazing!
No respect for Ferrari as a company here. Theyve lost that entirely so.... RIP EM UP!🙌
When in doubt, 360 out
This is EXACTLY what i would do with a ferrari, and you can only do it in a thicc-fil-a camo fit.💯💯💯
Click bait
ather seen this shit i block this chanel for good.
wow thatw how exactly   i used to play with my toy cars when i was child ... so satisfying
It's painful to watch how this expensive F got wrecked up like this, but was smiling through the entire video as I enjoyed it.   Cody, you missed the chance to say "please use code WreckFerrari for a 20% discount on the car protection bubble wrap"
best video yet. was hoping for an actual car to be thrown at it haha
at least someone uses a Ferrari for its intended purpose💀
I’ll put this Ferrari above almost any “hyper” car. Absolutely beautiful, Ferrari.
Cooollllll😂
This is fucking awesome
Este Rapa su madre tiene que ser loco🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻
If you buy and own the car that shouldnt be able to say shit… what a fucked world lol
Now give it to AMMO-NYC xD
and this is why ferrari gatekeeps the hell out of there special models you American man child
Ferraris lawyer watching this:
He plays forza in real life

Why is this considered entertainment in 2023
Americano ritardato
This was like a commercial I wanna Ferrari now
Lies you didn’t destroy it, first time you lied on your thumbnail you should be a shame to call yourself a car wrecker .
I bet “I withdrew 400k just to give it away” would get more views 😆
You do not deserve that car I'm never going to watch you ever again you really are stupid idiot go get help stupid
You're really are a Dom ass
U need help u are mesonet car up you really do need help I'm tired of watching you screw these cars up I'm done watching you get help
I really really hate this guy. He is so cringe.
shite video, Ferrari doesn't get destroyed at all.
Me and the boys in Forza
Click bait! This isn’t like you, you barely damaged it!

The bubble is a better product than the Ferrari

Y’all are dumbasses with too much money, please teach me your secrets
Hey whistlin you were on a news article for this video you probably won't find it but the title was youtuber tries to destroy Ferrari or something

Thank you for destroying this vehicle
POV: You are in a GTA mission at the hills with your supercar
Man you made my day this is fucking awesome
I hope you treat your GF and family  good
Aww I thought you were gonna destroy it like you destroyed the G wagon
How much did money did you get sued for

I'm going to put googleee eyes on the horsee lmao
Vending machine for your water bottle lmao
Me in Forza
I dont care what anyone says I actually laughed and smiled this whole video, great job! 🎉
Watching someone ruin an expensive vehicle hits different knowing i can't even afford a Corola or motorbike. I can't afford either of those but this is great content!
8:57 forza Horizon

You should make a video where you live in a third world country with no money
This gave me Forza Horizon 2 vibes

imagine being able to spend 400k on a car and do this to it like its no big deal
OMG😅
Love the Pops and bangs in reverse 😂
Ferrari company : Yes you buy from us but you gonna use the car as we tell you (Clowns)! Owner : My money my choice you freaks get on with it.
POV: forza horizon 6
This guy is a mess
I actually thought this was clickbait
No one talking about the cars I’m the background
This was beyond entertaining 😂
Ferrari can kiss our freedom of speech ass
U must be an idiot, instead of helping poor people, u r just wasting ur money for just fucking views
Would like to see this done on a laferrari
I saw some sorrow in his face 👀.
No worries bro 20 hoodie sales and it'll pay for the whole video (-:
Жалко машину
U should have gave that car to me
Dawg i was so nervous that he jus gonna leave the car like dat. So glad to know that he cleaned it☠️😭
Thank you for this brother ….but they shouldn’t get butthurt because it’s testing lol so they could use this as a commercial lmao they are pretty durable
Ferrari be like: this dude is doing nothing but promoting ferrari brand even better for the market
Lol😂..yyyyooooo he did that...let us know wat happened..did u get banned
I really need this car cover
I think you did a good job of advertising that balloon 😂
That car bubble is amazing.  I am impressed.
The GTR vid stung a little but I loved watching this thing get romped on.
Him jumping in the front trunk is more painful to watch than my dad leaving to get the milk.
Ferrari can eat a burito
Awesome dudes. I got a car you wouldn't destroy I guarantee it.
it held up surprisingly well
I kept waiting for a sink to be thrown at it
Now come on where’s part 2, where you stop pussy footing around and actually destroy it!
This guy reminds me of the freedom of GTA5 and I love it😂
can i have it
I just cried after he jumped in the frunk
Which one is it?
Bro really had nothing to do with his money
What is the point ?!??!?!!?!??!??! People have hunger and we throw money away for clicks in Internet?!??!?!?!?!?!?!??!
USA ... land of dumbs
LOL WHAT IS THAT ENDING??
Insane
Real life Forza Horizon 5}
Shoulda thrown a kitchen sink
I have to skip these exotic and Skyline destruction videos, but cartel videos don't bother me.
Just because you can afford to do this to such a beautiful car especially a Ferrari doesn't mean you should do...All it does is make you look like an overindulged, unappreciative A$$HOLE! Just wait until you're no longer able to make money off YouTube as all good things come to an end and it's coming sooner than you think!
You guys have to get a midget friend. He would have been a perfect thing to throw along with the others at the Ferrari in the bubble🤣🤣🤣
fh5 be like
That is the most fun anyone's ever had on a Ferrari
That bubble is a great product, link below?
que lindo tener plata para romper un ferrari
Yesss we need more people like this
That reverse entry was great
Nothing like wasting 400k and continually saying your broke.
Why doesn’t mr, beast do this
I wonder if one day he will buy some ultra expensive yatch just to blow it up
damn if i coud get 200 euros like now i woud fix so mutch things at my car and some guy destroying ferrari :((((((
Go sell it and donate to people who got no food stop showing off
what a waste of money, you deserve the blacklist
I sincerely hope you are going to actually destroy it... Ferraris are my favorite vehicle, but I absolutely despise the company itself.
He don't get sued becouse he showed how durable they are
.
Partway through the barrage I just started marveling at the stack of cases in the background and wondered what is in them.
I suppose that’s what Late Stage Capitalism looks like…
Just think about how many squatted trucks you could’ve taken off the road with that 400 large
A Lamborghini cover on a Ferrari! Ferruccio Lamborghini is gonna bless you himself and Enzo Ferrari is gonna dig himself out of his grave.
Send it to Ukraine
So ein bullshit
It's the only way you can get people to watch your video.😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😅
This has to be one of the best super car videos ever. Many people don’t even let their super cars off the road, so it’s really satisfying to see one just go nuts out on a Dirt Track. Makes me think of FORZA lol. Congrats on the purchase!
I would’ve liked to see this happen with a Nissan GT-R
Hahahahaah.  Well that was just great. Just fabulous.  I feel all warm inside.
This was actually a ridiculously good ad to sell even more Ferraris lol! Never expected it to perform so well!
That car is dope
Could have fed an entire village for years
Dude playing Forza H5
2:57 I feel like this guy
Best advertising I’ve seen on YouTube
IRL  Forza horizon
mrbeast
This video makes me so agrressiv i cant even describe it
The cover of Ferrari actually said huracan evo😂
Bro's literally playing Forza irl lol
Gotta get one of those bubbles 😮
I was born dump
That was fantastic. Can I come hang out, Dude?
I expected a destroyed Ferrari at the end of this video but boy was I disappointed lol 😆
The ego of this guy...Ladies and gentlemen, this is how a imbecil spoiled brat looks like.
Sid from Toy Story all grown up
Thats how I feel when I buy a new car on GTA
Forza Horizon in real life
Disclaimer÷ you must be billionaire to try this at your home  Otherwise you will course yourself my am I alive
I dream you become that much successful that you can test buggati and we will love to watch that ❤
Istg I was delivering for Amazon in they van on dirt roads in Kansas w the traction off just like this 😂😂
You make my whole day ✌
The whole video is literally me in GTA5 😂😂
it is literally forza horizon
let's collab with Mr. let's collab with Mr. Beast🥰
At least a guy with money who uses the stuff properly.
GTA IRL
Fill that wheel full of really short self tapping hvac screws and rips that field up some more
This video looks like something I would do in forza horizon
Losing your edge
eu nao faço isso com meu carro de 7milhão de ienes !  Porque ele faz isso com uma Ferrari que custa bem mais que meu carro ??
Ferrari questioning if they should sue or not...
I felt depressed at the first time i saw you breaking this car but now it feel happy of you destroying it 😀
You need a larger hill... Correction... Mountain side to you know roll things down.... for science of course
most ferraris just sit in clean garages rotting away, while this one is being driven like it's meant to
4:40 😂
The most chad thing Ferrari could do is send him another one.
Should have never gave u niggas money
I'm never going to buy a Ferrari if there's a risk of getting sued by the company for some stupid BS. If I buy the car, with my own money, I rightfully own the car, and I should be able to do whatever the hell I wanna do with the car, without risk of getting sued by some butthurt company. That's just stupid.
That is so much stupid to buy a Ferrari or a G Wagon whit 6 figures to broke it, why you don't help people in Africa whit this money they really need it so muuuuch
A person that don t respect e Ferrari is a shit person, yes i know that you know it....
Poor car...no respect for his soul ... 😭😭😭
Cody is the guy who literally let the intrusive thoughts win😅 ma boi playing real life GTA
I WILL GIVE YOU $13.89 FOR THIS FERRARI WHEN YOUR DONE WITH IT!!!
man is playing forza
If I'm going to buy a car that expensive then that car should be mine. and I certainly wouldn't want some overprotective company looking out for a car that I bought
Loving this video but cant help but cringe seeing him beat on it
0:01 Terrible f1 strategy
Give it back. Now.
The MrBeast of cars fr
13:20 RANDOM BULLSH*T GOOOOOOOOOOOO
typical american bullshit
you should have brought it to a tire shop and asked for mud tires and told them you wanted to go mud ridding lol
Rich spoiled white kids are the worst..........
Could you haul it in the bed of monster max?
Could a Toyota drive over it.?
I’m getting evicted cuz I can’t afford rent
Give me that car cause I don’t have a car
The subtitle of this video should also be: How much pain can you feel      Exevery second looks like the guy just throw 2k to the trash
Everything except the kitchen sink
LOL
I just came to comment not to watch how you doing that to my dream.
Ferrari best offroad car confirmed wtf????

IRL Forza
Bros playin Forza IRL
That's why you need someone who doesn't care about their car to test your protection products.
i love your content but this is a waste of a really nice car
why would you do this
This is what happens when you hang out with mark McCann 😂
Ferrari WATCHING this:😂

Yikes… it doesn’t effect my life at all but as a car enthusiast it still hurts to watch. I can’t understand why TJ sold him his Huracan.
When Ferrari F1 teams didn't get podiums in the first two race of 2023
One thing that you did not do was park your Monster Truck on top of the Ferrari  https://youtu.be/8RNbbDRdvBw
Hello mr cody iam  not from ferrari company but i am from that bubble plastic car parking protector company .u abused our product more then the ferrari car so we doing legal action on you please co-operate with us .put ur hands back .😅
I think it's that time to get the fuck out of ohio
I remember doing that up mount chilliad
Except for all of you who are bots. So bots, I love you, and Whistlinkid I'm still wishing you luck remaining a human unique content channel. If I have to deal with a guy who is an asshole for a living, I'd rather it be you than the machine
Haha I teased the bots and the bots immediately came after me! We should all be scared
the foreshadowing @12:18 hahahaha
Driver warning ⚠️ shud be you, you could get sued 😭😭😭😭😭
blacklisted
this video hurts😔
my friend instead of allways destrying you could give to charity sometimes.
only in ohio
Moooorreeee!!!!
real life Forza Horizon 5
cover is lamboggini but car is ferrarri
Proud of you kid. You've built a great channel/business. Laughed all the way through this video and never have been so happy to see a "high value" (crap) car taken apart.  Keep up the great work.
This guy is such a loser
I loved it when he jumped in the frunk😅
this is anxiety centrol
Exactly what I would do with a Ferrari... after watching this 😂
Low key an amazing advertisement for the car bubble lol
5:07 never heard a car that beautiful in my life, I normally hate cars with loud exhaust
Bros hella money he already destroyed a tesla
ふざけんな
bro's driving his ferrari like me riding my $2 million supercar in gta online
bruh
I came here looking for a Ferrari lawyer comment 💀
Imagine bein his friend so you could be there😂💯
Keep snubbing ye nose @ high brow  Don't stop until there's no more pearls to clutch
Pretty stupid, very retarded.
Not gonna lie that was a pretty big W for that bubble at the end
good video is good
everything he did here is exactly what i do in beamng drive
Use brains....😂lol ....take a needle or a nail...then throw all those ...this is how you can destroy not buy covering it😂😂😂
the perfect rally car. subaru wrx is gonna go out of business soon ‼️
This is painful to watch
He didn’t mean crutches did he
Can I borrow the Ferrari for my dad’s birthday. 😂
Who else finds it ironic that the biggest hit to Ferrari's reputation is how angry Ferrari gets when people "damage" Ferrari's reputation
Omg…………..I’ve never seen someone just truly be this careless. I’m assuming you must be stupid rich beyond what I can imagine. At least I hope you are.
Bro didn’t give a shit
i love this video but hate it at the same time
can it go through the mud pit though?
Drive it down a mountain logging road in BC
this makes me sooo annoyed  cause so many people would LOVE to have  a car like this
Buy a red pagani
I hate how stupid ritch you get destroying bad ass trucks and cars do u even like anything men!!!!!!!!!!!! I don't watch ur shit cuz of all this so I don't f*****know  u sir or something else
damn, i wish i have fun like that with friends
Thiiiis is quality content
My guy is out there living the Forza Horizon life
your mates being the "voice of reason" makes every scene way funnier.
from the bottom of my heart. i sincerely hate you. you destroy some of the nicest stuff meanwhile others spend 10+ years just to have it... tidepod generation kids stg.
Let me get this 😅
It needs a floppy dong hood ornament.
Nintendo Mario and Luigi Ferrari are having a copyright circle Jerk
*Casually offroads a Ferrari*
How in the hell did he get approved by Ferrari to buy one of their cars. Like what? And yet they got mad when deadmau5 put a wrap on his
i wish i had that damn car holy hell!
I just watched a 14 minute ad for that car balloon protection thing. Amazing! (Tbh i am impressed by the balloon...and also that the Ferrari didn't pop an airbag after all that beating)
O k I love the bombardment of random s*** at the end
damn. that cover really works.
10:05 this be me in b asphalt 8 airborne
Love love this !
El Ferrari no lo hacía nada mal en tierra, quizá no sería mala idea inscribirlo al WRC.
Thats one way to use ur business expenses
Can I have this car
this guy should be put behind bars for real he's just torturing his wallet
Ferrari is typing....
Перевод!!!!!!
i am more impressed with the cover then the ferrari
You don't have the brains to give me that car.  And send to Poland
10:18 Haha grinding next to a Jet Fuel
This guy is playing forza irl
Next video: I'm getting sued 😂😂
The JerryRigEverything for cars
These new GTA mods are getting wild!
honestly don't care how much it cost, I had a good time. do the buggati next
The last minute of the video had me laughing so hard 😂 especially the ladder that someone managed to throw all the way over it from that far away
I honestly enjoyed this video throughout due to the sole fact you did whatever the hell you wanted to your Ferrari because you enjoy doing so lmao.  Take that L, Ferrari. Let their owners have fun with your cars.
Haha. That's what's up..  I can't even afford a $1000 car
I know its his money but dude could be changing lives instead of destroying expensive stuff
bro is build different💀💀
Man just plays forza horizon in real life
Pretty good rally car if you ask me. Ferrari should think about a WRC works team🤣
I was gonna make a Doug demuro joke then you made it for me😂
I’m equally in love with the beauty of this car as I am with his ability to stick it to the man.
Hah...if the car itself wasn't faulty, then I guess Ferrari is writing a lawsuit just now for sure. Not because of misusing the car, but because of showing them as a brand, that is a bunch of arseholes.
This is what Elon will do after the tesla video 😅😅😅😅
Enzo would be shitting himself…. I love it.
I’m thoroughly impressed 👀😂
what a beautiful car
🇵🇱👍🇵🇱👍🇵🇱
Hey bro, if you decide to get rid of that car I'll give you $5 for it now if anymore. Not a penny lettuce $5. And I'll come and get it
👎🏿
So you got sued? If so, it was worth it 100%, best video of all time.
Kids don't do drugs
Not being funny but thsts pretty durable 🤔 so if ferrari get mad your technically proving a point 😂
Did you get sued
Thank you for this
I knew it so the bubble meme is from you 😂
Bro is literally playing Forza in real life 😂
the doug demuro clip killed me
I though they were going to throw the G-Wagon on it at some point
O Shit
thank you
nothing against you, but the way this beautiful car was handled hurts me even though i don't any.
If you would had to actually work for the money i guarantee you would snap your own hand in 2 before doing that to a half a mil car.
how to go on the ferrari black list
Rear/mid engine cars are no joke handling wise in the situations he was driving in.  Gotta hand it to him the kid can wheel it.
You guys treat plastic gas cans unfairly.  Try putting fuel in them before throwing.   Use as intended 🙏
this video is just senseless! well done for our numb world! thnx
I miss the good old days where you posted multiple videos on the same car, showing its progression, how it's held up, and what you've done with it. Not what we get now. Where you just show use what you bought and fuck around with it a little bit and then put it away.
Awesome part is he made a quarter million on this video.
9:40 just wow its almost like it belongs in the dirt
What I don’t understand is how would they file a lawsuit when you bought it ? Like it’s your property now they have no control over it what so ever
some Italian dude is pretty pissed rn
Such an awesome fn car
🤣🤣🤣 bet you Ferrari is mad about you.
He’s MrBeast but with Car MrSupercar
Forza irl be like:
Bro is doing things I wouldn’t do in forza bro
Cody Is gonna put his special touch on this car
When he figures out it goes off road better than the million dollar monster truck.
Cease and Desist speedrun world record
It's funny that this has finally been done and it's also not funny that the price of the brakes alone on this thing could pay my rent for over 8 months 😂
that shows Ferrari..reliability... now i desire one but not to drive like this
Once I get enough money to but a few Ferraris I totally need to crush one and hang up the crushed car in my garage.
welp the bubble gets a 7/10 - IGN
I have the sudden urge to draw dicks on every Ferrari badge I see with a sharpie. That was so hilarious.
I am now subscribed.
As someone who's sick and tired of Ferrari suing people with cease and desist orders due to "defamation of the brand" I support you with these destructive tests.
Me- if i EVER hit the lotto.
those cars lick balls like the ones that make it
Y just keep it
Gogole ricain !!!
Holy shit Americans truly live the F@#king life.....dude please buy me a car and I'll wrap it with whatever design you want including your face or a turd😂 try me I'm being for real.....i just lost my car to the bank
I’m watching the video like thats a law suit and so is that and I’m also like don’t do that
The should have sender with a kitchen sink be thrown last
could you please give me a car next time instead of destroying it plssss
13:30 "average day at the shop"
You forgot to throw the kitchen sink!!! WTF
What a life this man has
imagine being so rich u can waste this kinda cash.... man
Loved the ending.  It can definitely be used as an advertisement for the company that created this car cover.  If you ever get a sponsorship from car covers make sure to remember to give me a cut ;)
Wtf fix the homeless situation
bro thinks hes mrbeast
This is the dumbest video I have seen on this site.
Can't hold it that moment he spit on the badge xD
You can buy me too ferrari :)) hahaha
Can we just appreciate how beautiful this car is
buggy wheels on the ferrari
I drive a Ferrari more accurately in Forza than he does in real life 😅
Isso que é viver bem
second half of the title should have been “while kids starve all over the planet” !!
9:39 That's such a good shot!!! so fkn cool... driving a sports car in the woods like he in GTA 😂
ferrari cancelled the end of this video.
This causes me physical pain. Better keep watching.
Now that's a good reason to subscribe to you for
Damn, ship me one of your (ready to drive) cars.. I really need a ride.. any ride before you destroy another one...😢
FORZA IN REAL LIFE
More dumb
I don’t know whether I’m disgusted or amazed 😂
Welcome to Blacklist. Enjoy
منتهي هالورع 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Oh boy Ferrari wont be happy abt this
This mf should be banned to live
me in gta be like
Heave you got you’re law suit yet
Very satisfying and  refreshing video. Tired of watching Ferraries on preety roads and being babied on.
dam the white supra
If it were me, I would run you over with the same Ferrari😊😊
ending of the video..lol😂
This is how I play Forza Horizon
gta in real life epic. ❤
See you people is like when i was young and watch Jackass movies, that group put themselves to the pain, and you put the cards to the pain, but one thing is the same, the two groups ar compose of huge asshols
Idc what anyone says I would love to spend a day with you and do this this is so lit
wtf noob 5 mln subskrib
Hell yeah fuck ferrari
Thank you for this Been so long since TaxTheRich100 has uploaded and you helped fill the void that’s been left in my heart with this video  Exotic cars rallying is the freakin coolest
From everyone who would love to drive Ferrari, you're an ASSHOLE (FUCK YOU) !!
Bro just casually bought my brothers dream car
seriously that was prolly the best bubble demo ive seen....
Living the dream where you can throw a bunch of stupid stuff at a Ferrari. Super jelly.
😳😂😅 testing car protection 😂😂😅😅😂
I fucking hate you but I fucking love you
The real life forza 🤣🤣
That sound was dope
Forza horizon activate hahahah
All of us had curiosity to see a ferrari doing rally 😄
Love it!!! Ferrari is turning redder than the paint on this car right now
13:17 gimme a hammer (proceds to throw every item in the building)
So how's the lawsuit going? 🤣
who is this guy
The orange extension ladders are honestly super heavy
I reported DR giveaway for impersonating this channel. The person who is replying to a bunch of people to text them. It's a scam.
Hilarious video man, laughing the whole time
bro is playing forza irl 💀💀
Real life forza
Best laugh I've had in days...
Remember the time we ferrari up!goofs
Dude is playing forza in real life
Cody,s a spoilt rich kid genuinely only the second vidio iv ever watched just came across this dude literally about 20 mins ago an can bet a million dollars he's a spoilt rich brat.
Why destroy 400k car instead of helping the need
Обожаю мои рекомендации)
Bro that car is fucking beautiful
Good stuff 👏
What are you wearing: my outfit thick filet. . I always bring protection 😌
the only thing destroyed are americas poor and forgotten
Bro this i every forza horizon player to exist
You should of taken it to Maco for a premium $599 paint job before you started
I like Ferraris. I thought this would make me cry. I've only found this to be the most impressive Ferrari review yet. Wow. 🙂
T’es un con
In this life people divides on 2 categories - creators and consumers. Consumers most stupid people and useless. Better create something instead of destroying beautiful car. Any complete idiot can destroy Ferrari!!!
what a idiot
Forza Horizon 5 be like
My favorite genre of rich people
But this is all about people who lease right? Cause if you own it you can shove that letter where the sun don’t shine
i like the part at the end it was satifying
Physically hurts to watch😭
I don't think I've been this apprehensive in awhile. Not to worry, it's just a $400,000 Ferrari...
So this is what I look like when I'm playing Forza horizon
forgot to throw the kitchen sink at it ... just saying...
car guy hate you for this🌚
https://youtu.be/J76A9pLSkAU LOL!
This is quite possibly the gayest shit I’ve ever seen but I can’t stop watching the stupidity
WhistlinDiesel92 will dick ride this comment
It’s like Jeremy Clarkson and Josh.O’s love child😂
I just want a Hilux 😭 still
this is a guy who will say i bought a 10 billion pound rocket and crashed it in 1 second
when they started throwing shit at the bubble i laughed so fucking hard
I can’t get over the Far-re-ri😅
Semplicemente stupido
POV you are playing Forza horizon
Gmod Irl.... or better yet GTAV irl......
He just did a real life Forza Horizon video.
FH5 IRL! 🤣
Speed run to get blacklisted
Bunch of clowns with too much money you don't deserve.
"hey guys today i bought the  new gta online vehicle and we are testing it"
cant stop smiling)
I'm convinced that if you just made a metal sportscar frame and stuck a prius engine in, it's only slightly worse than a lot of sports cars you see today.
😂😂😂❤
Feŕari is going to blacklist your family for the next 2 generations from buying a ferrari 😂
Bro got a Losi baja rey
Oh the end of the video would have been perfect if you had thrown a sink
When did forza get so realistic
Это пиздец …
This must be what forza horizon would be like in real life
May I suggest a Christmas yule log of things being thrown at the Ferrari
Forza in real life
What are all those military boxes in the back
Wait he still has his General Lee! I thought he got rid of it 🥰
Quero ver fazer isso no Brazil
Love it, I started really laughing out loud when he stuffed the water bottle thru it's nose 🤣
good luck on the lawsuit
This man wylin fr he's living his best life at least I'd be say that if I could do this shit
Ever seen a grown man cry, well today I laughed and cried. I felt emotions a man should never feel. I’ve been to the bottom of the ibis and I am blind and no longer have hope. 😢😅😢😅😢😅 poor car
Ooooh I treat my car like it’s the love of my life, ooooh that poor car 😢you must have a lot of fun 😊
While I enjoy watching your videos for someone like me who can only afford a wrx it’s hard VERY HARD to watch this. 😢 you deserve your spoils but oh that hurts watching 😢
Next up Koenigsegg Regera durability
Holy shit those over priced hoodies are really bringing in the cash. Who would’ve thought appealing to 12-year-olds would pay off a few years later
forza horizon in real life😂
Man honestly I prefer seeing this than the fast and the furious
Driving through that field and wooded area was like real life Forza Horizon. Looks like a lot of fun.
i am now a permanent subscriber after watching two videos (tesla and this one) im so innit
well thats actually a really badass durable car ngl
Vergognati distruggere una macchina è da persone incivili spero che ti mandino a processo quelli della Ferrari non si distrugge una macchina perché hai i soldi
Can’t quite put my finger on it but this guys sucks
Oh my god that is awesome  I need to be working as hard as this guy
reminds me when forza puts you on a dirt road with the gps and you are in a hypercar
Why, though
WE NEED RALLY CONVERSION OF THIS RED FERRARI , OFF ROAD , CHUNKY ,  THEN THROW IT OFF THE CLIFF WITH A PARACHUTE .
...
뒤진다  🎉
some people have way to much money
its funny every time when cody get to break shit so funny \
You barely even touched this Ferrari, apparently you actually afraid of ferrari's lawsuit
you need a 40ft fire service ladder
you should pave the driveway and race the lambo and the ferrari
well... now he cant buy another one...
You would have given me rather than destroying it😢
Damn, I thought sam hyde was nuts
Couldn’t stop smiling, loved the absolute onslaught of tools
Ferrari deve amar vocês depois desse video 😂😂😂😂
What I love about Cody is that he knows it's just stuff have fun with it because at the end of the day when you die you can't take it with you so have fun with life have fun with what you have
Ferraris are really durable to put it through all that and it still going hell yeah
Forza Horizon irl

f40 is the best Ferrari ever made
I'm  confused!
1:42 just killed me... "in a good way"
He is literally doing things that I do in forza
You are an idiot. What can i say
if anyone deserves to be sues by ferrari, it should be this guy. i mean, i love watching you fuck up normal cars. But this is next level adhd kid chucking a spaz.
This new Forza Horizon hit different )
You should lift it
Nooo. :( Dude do whatever you want with a piece of shit tesla. but this.:( thats a beautiful car dude.
Литвин, ты ли это?

Dudes living in Forza Horizon
This guy is genius!:)))))))))))))))))))
I just came across this channel and don't understand what I have just watched 😂
gta irl 🤣
You should give me that car or buy me one
Tell me that your rich without telling me your rich:
Some ppl cant afford transportation and or its costs....and this is how u waste $$$
What is in all those cases behind the red car when it’s in the balloon thing?
cant tell if all of his videos are CGI or not
GTA in real life be like:
"warning you can get sued" 😂😭
Only 3k down?...ah every car needs to be driven warm right😂
А можно видео как-нибудь на русском тоже выпускать?
This guy is a fool
I think it’s missing a lift kit, and big supercharger on the hood
It definitely needs buggy wheels
내 인생 최초로 제대로 페라리를 운전하는 사람을 드디어 처음 보았다.
Get on Ferrari blacklist 💀💀💀💀
I wasn’t ready!!!!!! In my Kevin hart voice
Pog
Forza horizon in real life graphic mod 😂😂
I wish I was this blessed
Tom cruise trunk jump!
This is some shit out of forza
If you want to piss off Ferrari put a Toyota Corolla engine in it.
This guy is the most ridiculous sonofagun i've ever watched, and I'm loving every second of it.
The Ferrari outperformed the Honda Ridgeline
Forza horizon real life
That ending though
You ever wanna give that Ferrari away I’ll take it off you my man. 😂
FUCKT OPYUOIHB MAOITHRRERFUCKERS I AWATNWERESD TO SEE TOU GUYS TO DSESTROY IT
Please stop 😭😭😭😭
My man over here playing forza on real life
Everything I wonder when I look at a tesla
This is forza in real life
Can you buy me a Tesla lol.
Buys a Ferrari, puts a Lamborghini cover on it.
Where  too get need one asap,  bez  63, and     grp   2o18
My idea of a rich frat bo
This is weirdly therapeutic.
This whole video is a compilation of potential ''whe she tell you she's alone at home'' meme.
This is like a SAW Movie for every Ferrari Engineer LOL
Me in Forza Horizon:
I can't express how much I loved this
This feels like forza horizon 5 irl
Thanks.
This man is the definition of try me
I myself never wrote myself on this shit on this channel that only destroys cars look at that guy how dare you destroy a ferrari there are people who dream of having a ferrari. there's a guy like that just because he's rich, he's earning well on youtube, he buys a dream car to destroy. I myself never left like on this guy's channel because it sucks
Finally someone who drives his Ferrari properly!!!👏
Great east of France clearly is insane ,pure boy
is he wearing lipstick?
I just realized I smiled and laughed throughout the whole video. Makes me wanna Ferrari even more! Also because it really shows how durable they are, and how well engineered they are
Omg Ferrari is going to sue hi… sike! You thot! It’s a gorgeous car owned privately and he should be able to do whatever he wants with it!
I just bought a house for what he paid for the Ferrari. I wish I could do the same and spend the money like he does. He should Lemme have that Ferrari. Plz🥺
So at this point you're just making more money than you know what to do with and destroying things others can only dream of having, and in turn you make a crap load more money. What an incredible business model. I'm not really sure how to process it. I do hate to see a precision machine destroyed for some laughs and money, but as they say, don't hate the player hate the game.
D:
I love it because Ferrari are the worst. They're like Rolex dealers. Gotta buy many of our master full cars before we will give you time of day. So I say destroy that MF
It’s so stupid how a company can sell you something and then tell you how to use it. Hell no! If I’m buying some thing I’m gonna do whatever the hell I want with it. Companies can go suck a big one if they gonna tell me how to use my property
Wagon Wheels bruh!!!!! Lets Go
I fucking love this for all the wrong reasons
I'm a little disappointed that they threw everything but the kitchen sink...
This is why China is beating us in the men department. They are breeding mental and physical killers while we are turning our  men into outright children.
When your done with it put the engin in your truck
As someone who loves Lamborghini, hates all that sassy bullsh*t that ferrari cries about, I absolutely loved this video! ❤
bro ride like me playing FZ4
you hit the news lol
forza 6 ????
Love the kind of short videos now 😃😃👍👍
They aint donuts there tonuts
Only you didn't destroy it. Clickbait that typifies the worst of youtube influencer "culture"
can someone tell me where do they get the money for these crazy videos?
Shoulda put some off road tires on it
Love it 😂🎉
Show how much trash it is to put them pampas assess to shame they over spent on a peace of cra p
Kill it
I need you to hook a tiller to her
This is pure gold!! 😂😂😂 I need more vids on this!! Wagon wheels? Lift kit and tires?
Does ugly donuts and it looks like it smells bad too.
This dude just plays Forza horizon in real life and I love it!
Sounds like Formula One Dirt Rally, let's have  these garage and showroom babied cars put to good use.
He’s playing gta irl
Buy and destroy as much polonez shitboxes as you can
Clickbaitr
Totalitas......
"you are a liar, and one of the leading manipulators, you took your car and wrote such an inscription, just so people would look, you are a monster, that car was not damaged at all"
Pro just give me that Ferrari 😭😮‍💨😂😂😂🤝
He looks like my gta character
The quality! Laughing my ass off the whole time. 13:30
The reverse bootlegger was such a gentleman's flex.
They are going to sue you, for sure.
You should of thrown a chainsaw with the gas stuck on towards that plastic bubble 😢
mf gonna get sued

What is the crazy video
Mad to see a Guernsey car in a WD video!
dedis prochi movtkan
At the end it looked like my toy box when i was a kid
You just need to change the subtitle. destroy!!!!!! lol
Nah sorry but this isn’t funny
What did you do with the car after?
sei un coglione piuttosto che buttare via i soldi dalli in beneficenza   PORCO DIO
If Ferrari's ever achieve self conscience, they will look back on this day.
this is what is called money for happiness or wasting money... even though many people are struggling to make money...
This hurt to watch
This made me cry while watching this
The end was sooooooooo funny
Now i want ferrari

Hello wbijaj na Wrak Race do Polski najlepiej do Gliwic
Wow....what a hero. Think how many peoples lives you could have changed with that 400k.....
Bro i cant watch this video😭😭
ROFL , thinking bout prancing horse owners cringing,  dude is funny
Bro taking rally into a next level 💀
You won't be able to eat it when your bank crashes.
Im just sad AF because it would be nice to have a model 3. lol. We been driving around in a beater for a long time now. I still love the content though. Hard work will put us in a nicer car. Til then, im gonna keep watching you destroy my dream cars. :)
My favorite part of this was the drifting his driving skills are amazingly incredible
This man has better cars than a forza player
This guy be playing Forza Horizon 5 in real life.
13:18 The firing rate of random objects flying toward the car is actually kind of impressive.
One k motor sound will announce 📣
Ferrari : you are banned..deleted from our customer existence... you are deleted from the past present future of our existence, your whole blood line is banned and the people who are watching this video and you are banned from buying a Ferrari 😂😂😂😂😂
WTF？
Yo en el forza
Lol Lamborghini cover on Ferrari 🤣
Although it was very painful to watch it seemed like so much of fun to be honest
Beating a dead (prancing) horse here.
Ferrari has certainly already filed a lawsuit for doing so with their brand
That is a nice sound exhaust
That dude is fuckng corazón like a sht 😅
The White Hellcat that was stolen in Houston and was driving at 150MPH SSpeeds was a good selling point for Dodge. For Ferrari… it’s this video right here!  BE THANKFUL FERRARI. Because now the world knows you make some tough exotic sports cars. There are people that are tired of overpaying for Bullshit.
This should actually be a Ferrari advertisement. Looks like it handled off road better than some rally cars.
can you plz buy me one, if you don't need yours , thx guys
I used to hate WhistlinDiesel for destroying a R32 GTR but now I'm starting to get his point. It still stupid, but why not?
I now officially hate you.
you are fucking nuts, by the way I am gonna buy this Ferrari as we don't have such good road as America. We do only have lots of speed breakers and mostly kind of off road. so Farrari can withstand right? I'm gonna do that.
dis should be a crime dis should be a sin💔🥲
POV: Charles Leclerc finally gets out of his contract
Is there anyway I can have this Ferrari???
You are playing forza in real life
Finally the bourgeois bow to the proletariat.
You forgot to throw the kitchen sink at it😅😅😅😅
POV: me in forza
Only a generation that has never had to actually work and build something would find this entertaining.
So that’s why they didn’t shoot the balloon down… So much durability that they had to let the elements wear it down first before penetration. Laughed so hard at the end man, that was quite the inventory.
F ferrai
Ferrari is the Nintendo of the car world
We are living in the movie “Idiocracy”
Still pumping great content, props.
*BTW? Love the satanist/wicca hand signs bruh*        #DayOfTheRope #NoQuarter
*no , you made the driveway "curvy" for obvious defensive reasons*

Elon will be proud.!!
Don’t do Doug demuro like that
If I win the lottery
Lucky!
bro is playing forza horizon in real life lmao 💀
Everyone who's watching this - you are banned to buy a Ferrari 🎉
Bro is forza horizon
Co za idiota!!!
Ferrari can't do shit if you own it. Once they sell it it's not their property anymore you could easily win if they take you to court
patologia
I’ll buy it off you at a discount😂
bro, imagine being this guys neighbor  🤣😂
the supra
Bro is playing real life Forza 4
Mon dieu c'est n'importe quoi, honte à vous de détruire des voitures votre contenu est vraiment minable.

jokes aside this thing is fuckin sick
When i watch your video that make's me sad. Not because you disrespect Ferrari by slaughtering on of their car... NOT AT ALL.  But because you lack respect for peoples who have troubles making ends meet.
I bought a Ferrari just to destroy it because I m the worlds biggest dumb👍
At least we know it works
Is this the new Forza game?
Amazing how none of the tools punctured the bubble amazing quality!
The clear canopy around the Ferrari what company was that with?
Extremely good advertising for the bubble
I needs to get me one of them farreris to haul me some manure around the back 40
Hahahahahahaha. Go F yourself Ferrari!!!! This man is a legend.  “ the only way to wash your Ferrari is with a 3300 psi power washer lol hahahahahahaha!!! If you get sued start a go fund me. I’ll contribute!!! 😂😂😂😂
Am I the only one who was more impressed by the huge bubble car protection?
I dont know you but I love you bro. I always wanted to own a Ferrari and if I ever do I would do what you would have done. Enjoy it for what it is. Oh, when youre done with it can I buy it off you?  You just gained a subscriber. Great video
rear window is what i paid for my civic lmao
Im waiting for the day he modifies a super car with insanely high suspension and takes it to a utv park lol
Yo Cleetus Mcfarland needs those bubbles for his cars in the new bay he built.
Absolut richtig was du machst…

I'll buy this car for the same amount of money he paid for it even if it's destroyed that's how much I support you. But I don't have the money
Bro is playing forza horizon in real life
There’s just something about a Ferrari on the dirt that gives me a tingle.
3:19 LOL
This is one of my favorite vids of yours XD
This is just how I drive in Fh5 lol 😂

Please give the ferari pls
Ferrari employee here expect a cease and desist letter next week
Painfull to watch

I thought Ferrari sell their cars only to racommended customers.
Bro really covered the car with a hurracan evo cover
Y
That was hard too watch man 😅
Must say, truly blessed to have all those bad ass rides in your garage. Keep up the hard work. #WhistleDiesel.
Well that's the commercial I want. Driving off road, showing limits... Ferrari owes you money hahaha
Nice
Nice
This is an absolute banger! Loved every second of it! I sure hope he can keep doing shit like this forever! 😀😀😂
Thank you for being the Underwriters Labrador for vehicles showing all the weak points.    I was going to buy a G wagon until I saw that it wasn't as durable as a Toyota Hilux.  Uparmored Hilux it is!
Whatever company made that car balloon thing is about to run out of stock. It's actually very impressive
Threw everything but the kitchen sink
After this video was finished filming. Whistle boy immediately went down on his knees and started screaming at the top of his lungs  " I want cock !! In !! My !! Moooouuuth !!
👎👎👎👎👎👎
You are a complete knob head how dare you stand on the roof of that motor or treat it in that way you are a d-ckhead
He bought this salvaged from a guy in Sacramento. The value of this is definitely less than 200K. 😳

bubble ferrari
broo why are you buying a ferari if you dostoy it
Are you hiring?? Id LOVE to work for you. Free!!
You would lose a lot more money because ferrari would win that lawsuit
Voitko antaa ton Ferrarin mulle? Ois aika kiva peli ja pitäisin kunnossa

someone will not be allowed to buy a ferrari ever again💀💀
You are a idiot
Who is paying for this crap of yours?
You have some serious driving skills buddy 😎
They should literally pay you for advertising that car bubble!
Bro's living in GTA v
Nice to see some official testing *(Clownnose)*
Can't wait until the Ferrari corpo suits see this and try to sue you for abusing their car and besmirching their ''brand'' lol.
마지막에 다 날라오는거 존나웃기네 미친
I know I have a sick sense of humor, but your videos are funny.
I wont even do this on a game 🥲
I wonder if Ferrari blacklisted whistlin diesel?
Lawsuit incoming 💀💀 0:00
Literally threw everything except the kitchen sink
Shhhhh!!! Send me a car!!
Should have go to rally day or do it in car meet
13:17 this part😫
It looks quite good on a gravel road. Ferrari need to get back into rallying.
Oh nice, Ferrari hasn't taken this down yet
His videos get more insane in every upload
Imagine the video got deleted by mistake 😳
Solo un povero deficiente.....e basta.
stupid bro
Bro is playing GTA v in real life
If in the future you'll want to buy a limited production Ferrari, I sincerely doub't that they will sell one to you, after this video. This is sick, and you all US people that enjoy this shit are sick.
GTA V irl
Дурень
I was going to comment until I saw that there are 40k COMMENTS !!! It kind of seems pointless now…
ADHD with a lot of money
Good
Can you please clean that spit off the ferrari
4:20 IS THAT A SUPRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!
I wish I could drive a Ferrari 😢 would be a dream to drive one
idióta vagy!
that is some funny shit, good to see people with money living it up and doing what we all wish we could do
garage kept
:0
omfg when you started throwing shit I lost it laughing
After this whole video, the Ferrari doesn't even look like it has a scratch
The big question is; so did you get sued?
13:15 WRENCH FIGHT!!!
I need that car coverage holy shit!
the bubble actually worked, that was kinda surprising.
Me playing forza
Me babying a base 2020 gt mustang 🤦‍♂️ I’m going out to do donuts now
Loved this one!
If ferrari watches this video then ferrari will ban this person from buying any of their cars
got the engine sound on the up hill dirt drag as my ringtone..  thanks
That's good to see a Ferrari to be destroyed
Has anyone else noticed that he covered the Ferrari with a tarp that says Lamborghini?
Didn’t destroy it, lame clickbait.
In 1993 I wrapped one of those around a tree @ 140 mph after school one day 2 weeks after getting my license. I Hit the tree backwards. The rear tire my driver's seat an the rotary engine were 1 unit afterwards.  Never found the sun roof. Never got my spleen back.  After a nice Life Line Helicopter ride to Methodist trauma unit spilling 8 pints of blood I was on the last bag of plasma when we landed. Got a Great Story, a new titinam hip an ate 30 dollar tylenol for a few months.  All for a cool 1.2 million dollar Hospital bill.    😉  Live once kids.......
Same way I'd treat that turd on rubber.
speaking of Koenigsegg, WHY DON'T YOU BUY THAT INSTEAD!?!?!?
It needs a plow
Dont worry they wont sue u they will have u whacked....you idiot zit head
how can you throw so much shit a ferrari without laughing?
This video had to boost sells
I wonder what you will say about your own videos years from now, when you grow up..
😮😮
The company that owns those car covers definitely needs to pay Cody. They need to use that last bit for a commercial. 😂 Pretty bad ass cover.
Most stressful 14 mins of my life
I wonder if you can pull the abs fuse like a regular car to disable the air bags
Remember when we were beating up shit trucks on this channel? Wild to think about.
Next time give it to me, I'll destroy it. Sure, yeah give it to me I'll destroy it fir you.
Matrix? What matrix
The end was like the grand finale at a 4th of july
After this vid ferrai f8 is official an off road
👏👏👏👏👏
Fucking repulsive and disgusting to see this piece of white trash destroying such a work of art car like that.
Bros playing forza
As a person who loves these cars this hurts to watch but it’s entertaining at the same time😂
Haha 😂 great video man
Idk why but I personally didn't like Ferrari (the company). So this video was very satisfying
Am I the only car enthusiast who felt very uncomfortable with this video? 😢
Well I'm sure when you are doing 472 mph it will make it up most hills
That car bubble company shouldbpay you for this footage as a comercial
13:17 is all you need
Oh the headlights are suppose to be like that…. I thought he broke it lol.
What a scumbag thing to do. 400k just thrown down the toilet. You know how many lives you could change with that. How many animals you could help. Crazy
Hah the Ferrari with huge wheels would look cool
Putting vehicles to their proper use.  Why buy a sports car and drive it like a Nana. Thrash it
There might be some Hollywood movies, that cost less to make, than this video cost to make!
He’s literally me in forza
Bro has more money than common sense and this is what pisses me off
Insane that this video is still up😅
Put a 3" lift on it and put mud tires on it My right neckass would love that

Who knew a Ferrari has no problem going off road
any car people here? i have a 2013 dodge challenger (doesn't rlly matter for my question tho lmao) and I want to upgrade the exhaust centers and the muffler, but my catalytic converter needs to be replaced sometime, its all gunked up according to my local mechanic. do I need to replace the cats before I upgrade the exhaust or can I do the exhaust first and then fix the cats?
u are crazy
Por favor dobla tus videos a latino por favor!!! Sos grandee
Ce mec est un débile profond
Who cares if he spent 400,000 dollars on a car just to break it he’s having a great time living his best life

Well it’s been almost a month now so he’s probably in jail lol
I feel like I’ve been waiting for this moment waaaay before I subscribed, which I thought I did before, but I do not; However, that’s not the point. I just want to see how fart this Ferrari will go, before the cease and desist reaches his mailbox🫡
10:22 is the most rich hillbilly shot when he pulls up with the dirty Ferrari 😂
did he get locked up??
Cease and desist otw✉️
This is how my gameplay in Forza Horizon looks like
Man u are a treasure on youtube and all social media glad I subscribed 😂❤
real life forza horizon
youtube keeps unsubscribing me from your channel... Just an fyi.  I have to re-sub almost every time I wanna watch your vids
I think Ferrari should let him keep it… maybe he’ll pay good money on maintenance
WTF man you need to get some help, get out of my news feed
Just give it a General Lee wrap and jump it
Imagine WhistlinDiesel  engine swaps his ferrari with his lambo
Dear whistlinDiesel; please consider putting paddle tires on a dually as in 4 paddles in the back. Thanks in advance
this is beyond DDE level!
You should lift it. All some M/Ts and then just swap it for a diesel engine.👍🏽 your welcome.
Please hire a MLB pitcher to throw 100n MPH fastballs at the plastic bubble.
Video senza senso

Hey Cody I am 72 years old and I can not get enough of your YouTube videos. They make laugh out loud a lot. I am a subscriber for life. Keep up the good work buddy. God bless you.
For now it's like a commercial! The car carried on pretty good.
Nice googly eyes😆
Just another tutorial how to get 7 million views in just 3 weeks that's how it's done your welcome !
This one was painful to watch
Agora e só esperar o processo kkkkkk esse cara e doido 🔥🤣😂🤣🤣

Should build a rally track!
I loved the mustache.
Youre stupid bcs Ferrari win 400k and you lost 400k... a do tego nie szanujesz pieniędzy -.-'
I'm interested in the expensive looking wall of cases in his garage... Why so many, what are inside of those cases? 😳
this video made me mad asf
But above all, it was covered with a Lambo cover! That's a lawsuit right there 😭
This is the kind of shit you do when you're young and have so much money that you can afford to not give any F---s about anything. Just FUN.
вот недоумки....растрачивают деньги налево и направо...вместо того, чтоб творить добрые дела на благо всего живого...детство еще не закончилось у ребят....в принципе как и наше правительство...
Kinda boring taxtherich does a way better job
You do stuff to expensive cars we only see done in movies.
A good one would be him taking care of a Honda ridgline just to piss people off
Totally rewatched this video
Bro you should do a SF90🤣
Where is the destroy part?
it's weird that's you can't changes anything on super car like putting Artificial Grass on it as Art... Expression Art.
lambo cover on a ferrari Lol 💪🏽😂
It actually makes me happy. I thought I would hate it. Butt fuck Ferrari.
Turboflex ferrari:
You couldve donated that ferrari to ukraine bro

Bro you might just be helping FERRARI sell more cars 😂😂nice vid tho 🔥🔥
hate this kid
Tax the Rich is Back Folks!!!!
FOR SALE. slightly used.
That bubble could even save you from Ferrari lawsuits!
Oh. No.
Me in Forza:
From one point it’s a good way of showing how good the engine and formidable car of Ferrari is. But at the same time it’s a possible sue case coming at you
What are all those containers on the back wall for? 🥸
Just fuckin burn it!!!!
Fuck this world
It’s awsome seeing rare expensive cars and watching them get used and abused is just awsome
This guy never clickbait’s….awesome love you are video’s Broo !!!
This gave me anxiety. That’s my dream car
This is why people hate influencers. Its gunna be great in 5 years when youre broke thinking why did i smash that Ferrari. I dislike this kid for some many reasons for doing this.
LITTERALY BEST VIDEO ON YOUTUBE
Best video on YouTube
I am weeeaaak!! “THIS🤗”
What a mess. Could you do nothing better with your money?
Throw on some dirt tires and try it again.
The trust fund child never disappoints.
Wreck the shit out of it but make sure you can still drive it and bring it to a car show 😂. Everyone takes such pride in there vehicles, bring your beat to hell Ferrari like its the most important thing in your life and make up the dumbest excuses why it has "minor" damage.
Bro looks like he’s doing an off-road drift zone in Forza Horizon.
We need more viddddddds!!
Looks like me driving in Forza
Could've given the Ferrari to me if u didn't like it....   😂😂😂

Every time I open my YouTube page your videos are always at the top. I always glance at the Sub amounts… my man you’re killing it in the last 12 months!!! 3.2 turned to 4.9 real quick! Congrats on the success and thanks for the entertainment!
And where was that destroy part, not even visible damage. Im glad i only fast forwarded this junk video.
You’re a makes no sense
I was enjoying it so much, the video ended and I didn’t believe it😅
13:16 what is the box behind him
😮🤣🤣🤣🤣👍 American brother, YOU ARE THE BEST!!! your video is the best I've watched in the last 7 months.
Not him casually dailying the hilux
Pull the engine and brakes, put it in a Tundra, and run the Ferrari over with the Tundari. And that's how I feel about that
Eres un terrorista

Please give me a drone (quadcopter) dji mavic any air 2 or mini I really want a drone for myself but I don't have money ...(  Or just send money to a bank card
Ivem if the politics it's wrong, the car isn’t. But you are wrong to.
Put squad tires on monster Max
Dumbfounded you’re doing this during the splashing litigation..
Are you off your meds!!!  If one can spend $400K on a vehicle to destroy, think about the better use of 400K to someone who could use it. What a waste!!
I cant like it
Make a Ferrari monster max
big mistake
Buy a Mustang Shelby eat cheese burgers and ribs much better of doing this video.🙂
Bla, bla, bla
First 10 seconds into the video and he’s already going to get sued for that logo alone…😂
Buy an Enzo or La Ferrari  and burn that bitch
This is the best video on youtube
I have only one word - idiotic!
HE IS IN JAIL COME BACK WHEN YOU SE A NOTIFICATION
Wow this video makes me sick to my stomach I wished I had that kinda money need to think about the less fortunate people in life instead of flaunting but its enjoyable at the same time it would be better if you gave to the poor kinda like a robinhood
Me in gta:
What is this dude's job so he can afford this lifestile?
Diesel, damn it, how much longer do we have to wait for a new release?
Idiot
Bro think Is on gta5
Литвин, ты ли это?
NOW, THAT'S HOW YOU DRIVE A DAMN SPORTS CAR!!!! LOL HELL YEAH!!!!
Thats a very sensible thing to do
that LAMBO car cover lol
Stupid rich boy
your just some stupid american idiots
@ferrari put this men in the blacklist
I feel like this video confirmed that all my time in gta v climbing mountains in sports cars was completely accurate to real life
I think this needs a complete long travel suspension system like a trophy truck. Put some paddle tires on the rear and take it to Glamis and climb some sand dunes!
I will buy this from you for 1 Polish zloty
I was disappointed you threw everything at the car but a kitchen sink... I was really hoping to see a kitchen sink thrown at it...
I hate you and your channel
Forza player in real life:
Yeah "destroy"
Boring i waited something more exited
There's a million better things you can spend mommy's an daddy's money on WTF !!!
Love it.
Forza horizon 99
Yo man I love this channel but my dawg 400k can feed a hood for 6 month or more dawg
Too BAD.... YOU COULD GIVE ME 1/2 THAT MONEY AND I COULD OF PAY OFF MY MORTGAGE AND SPEND MORE TIME WITH MY FAMILY !!! OH WELL :))
if ferrari doesnt sue this guy i will
Did you get banned from buying another Ferrari after this lol
Best way to make ferrari angry
That orange ladder made me genuinely nervous.
You go inside the air tent and get Ferrari parts thrown at you.
Americani...
This is my dream car. 😂 but fair plan my man work hard play hard
Please durability test a 2023 Toyota tundra trd pro looks beefy but it’s a hybrid that gets 13mpg i wanna see what she does in the car destroyers hands
My guy is playing IRL forza with a Ferrari lmao
It's actually crazy that he's an insanely good driver
4:10 ferraris make good trampolines
❤
“Hello, Ferrari here. It has came to our attention that the car you have has been abused and with that saying you are being sued.”
This makes me wanna cry but if I was that rich I would probably be doing the same
This video hurt me more than the rest to watch. I’m here for it though!
Sti video qui mi fanno bestemmiareeeee, questo è un emerito coglione, perchè compra le auto per distruggerleeee? Questo è coglione
Must got the sist and assist order lol
Curious if u bought it second hand or from the dealer cause once Ferrari finds out what ur doing to there baby . There going to buy it back
How do you think he got this vehicle? Or do you think he just straight up dropped 400k on it
For his next video he should buy the world's most expensive helmet wear it and try to destroy it that would be the greatest video ever
Use me as dislike:
this dude drives his ferrari as if its forza horizon
Can you do a durability test of the new Toyota tundra trd pro
This video is basically a message to ferrari saying "tlogelang ho phapha"😅
Dont real test
Poor F8 Tributo :(
U shud of played Chocolate 🍫 rain ☔️ in the Ferrari maybe that wud of destroyed it
forza horizon
y u destroying my dream car broo
Does the bubble at the end also defend against a three sword style attack with armament haki?
No video for 3 weeks. U in jail?
This is actually good advertising for Ferrari. Forget suing if anything they should give him another one. He’s shown everyone how crazy good a Ferrari can handle being put through absurd levels of abuse.
I heard you are scared of ford maverick’s
Iam broked when I see this video  you just destroying it 😔☹️
I absolutely love this guy..
He decided to play forza in real life. That's wtf is up
That Ferrari legal team entry was the best LOL
Ferrari never give him car again
Ferrari watching this .....😬💀!
Tu sei solo un povero coglione. Che spettacolo indecente. Vergognati
Buy a huge tractor
But have you seen the Ferrari with the rotary engine and s14 front end
he could probably sell its as brand new and no one would know
Why you dont destroy Electric Cars ? So much better than this beautys
Bro I am beyond happy for your success but I can’t keep watching this stuff 😂 my heart and stomach are literally in knots. It’s not even my money it’s yours I get that but it hurts. It’s like when people buy a civic type r and put all the ricer mods on, or any of the muscle cars heck any cars and put the scratch eye stickers on. 😂 like I get it I do but I can’t do it
#idea put plane wings in a truck, and fly that hoe.
12:16 caught me so offguard bro
this is so sad to watch
Ты никогда больше не получишь Ferrari потому что обосрал их😅😅😅
He basically made a great ad for that car bubble.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
( ferrari f90 trubuto

When he said gently onto the roof, and I’m not going to dent it, all of his weight, just goes onto the Ferrari, and then on him just to the Ferrari

Yoo bro can you help a brother please

WOW!!  Have you seen what HeavyDSparks just did for his community?, his country?, he rallied his team together and went to the mountain communities of San Bernardino that were crying out for rescue from the California blizzard that buried them in 10 ft of snow, he is a TRUE AMERICAN!! and you have the men and machines to help your country instead of destroying things for views, be a real man like Heavy D and use your new found wealth to help this country and your community.
Kids with 2 much money and disrespectfull behaviour.... awful.
Hey Diesel can I have the Ferrari? Thanks ahead of time. Ill care about it just as much as you promise!
I think Ferrari will ban you forever

you could have used that 400 k to feed the poor and help the homeless. lame a@@ video s&it face.
He just lives the game Forza Horizon .
You are some wanker
You are stupid
You are killing me… looks nice on the outside however, Ferrari over rated overly priced etc… tear that Shh up! Drive it like it’s a ATV. You are an epic-destroyer.
Can you come buy my truck an destroy it need the money
If I had that money I would be doing the same after all life is one
Can we take a moment to appreciate his driving skills
Que loco me haces reír como no tienes idea
Give me a house so I don't continue enduring humiliation from where I live that I live rented sorry for the audacity
In Italy this guy İş  bimbominchia.
Yr my hero  Do you want my first born
"destroy" i've been clickbaited once again
This is awesome!
The country is suffering from economic depression, people are losing livelihoods, homes, futures, but yeah let’s say a big FUCK YOU by spending and wrecking more money than most have ever seen, money that would save families and futures. What an absolute show-off out of touch dick head.
This is hilarious and absolutely awful at he same time 😂😫
Ferrari Just Put him in the black list, but Who cares?
that was painful to watch
can i have the engine when ur done lol
this is what happens when you are young and have too much money... sad day to be a ferrari. But I am impressed with its performance
I want to see that Ferrari get some slow motion air. Now that would be sic.
Could you destroy a Subaru wrx ?
If you don't want the Ferrari then blow it up with C4.
Only rich people can be this wasteful.
haha wow..can i have the car when you are done with it ? xD
you dont mind giving me this ferrari on my birthday in may?
I think this guy wastes so much ability and potential to help people. Kind of trash if you ask me.
Me looking for that one barnfind in forza
Life is SUPER unfair. Lol
tu sei pazzo
Im starting to like this guy :D
This dude is a legit psychopath.
Try spending one million dollars in 1 day
Guys gonna start losing followers if he continues to spend his money an fuck around not making content better get on it!
Send me a car like that please
Whistlinediesel always the best of the wordl.

Wow a ferrari with a lamborghini cover 🤣🤣
Yo it can take a beating.
I feel Cody showed some real progress in learning restraint in this video as the Ferrari wasn't totalled  immediately - good job buddy!
do you guys still shoot on iphones only??
as a car guy this was more horrific to watch than the 2 girl 1 cup
13:18 I wish that hit you 😅
So hard to watch but so awesome! That’s a dream car right there 😂 keep this up bro your killer to watch!
Peak american ignorance 🙂
This is my first time seeing his video and omg my heart popped out every min🤧 Love this shiiii
Тупее в жизни ничего не видел. Человечество деградирует на глазах. Регрессия !!!!
I highly doubt it's possible for them to sue anybody just because if you purchase the car it is yours Ferrari does not still own a Single part of it sorry but if I had the money would buy one and ship it to Italy write two Ferraris front door and then I would take a shit on the hood in front of mr. Ferrari himself or whoever it is that thinks they can sue people who purchased their shity overpriced coffins
13:17 - I pissed myself from laughing. THANK YOU!
"Unfortunately - we do not care!" Love this one.
You could buy me a Ferrari man😂
why
Vergognati non sei degno di possedere una Ferrari
*Ferrari is a good rally car*
That's most people dream car and you destroyed it value what you have🙂

My Lai Massacre. typical nazi americans, being racist to everything that ain't american. I hope they sue you for destroying a piece of ART. no american car can measure up, that's why chevrolet has started copying Euro sports cars.
You should buy a mining dump truck

Get a supra 2jz bro
This is  how you Fuck a car Ladies and gentlemen, Nice and slow, passionate I would like to say
I appreciate your content because it shows that physical stuff doesnt fucking matter. It can all be destroyed and disappear. It's a good message to show anything is easily destructible and that we shouldn't be mindless consumers.
I sense a legal process coming.
not Doug😭😭
La verdad que no hay nada más peligroso que un imbecil con iniciativa
Do a durability test with a rolls royce
Basically how I drive in forza horizon 5 but irl. THIS IS AWESOME!
Nice one
Why did you destroy This Ferrari
Oh shoot!, my funniest part is 13 :40 give me a hummer where did you got the guys who threw alot of those
"Your budget for this video is a bit over $400,000."

I feel like im never be able to buy a new Ferrari just because i liked this

I fucking died when they threw the crutch. XD
Why?
bro is gonna get blacklisted by ferrari
Bro got the skilllzzz and 🤑 money🥶😶
bro driving it like he is in forza horizon😂
classic clickbait
The cheapness of the interior designs in these supercars is shocking. There are custom designed civics with interiors that look that good. They seem to just bury them in carbon fiber and hope that nobody asks where the features went
Pull that motor and ahuv it in one them skylines
'Destruction' aside, his driving skills are top notch.
Well, why was it covered with an air bubble? I had to throw things at her without a bubble🤣
Buy a tesla just to destroy it🥶🥶🥶 do it please!!!!!
purrari
Forza IRL
BUY CAPYBARA OR I WILL TELL FERRARI
Here, take my watchtime...earn some bucks and get the next goody done! 🤣🤣
Just living life and not give a F&&@… 🔥 bros
Okay updates!!! How is Ferrari doing these days? Lol
Only thing left is that Ferrari is not donated to me yet.🙄
We can't often see a such dumb person on the internet. Supposed we are lucky to be able to watch it.
Wonderful, Ferarri is acting like a clown with all these cease and desist letters probably got a heart attack watching this
Wow i never see supercar go offroad Respect
Do a demo derby with a brand new car pls
WTF
There is a safety feature in ferrari🤣🤣🤣 Where all fencing will go in front
Actually if I was Ferrari I would use this video to sell this car saying it can handle anything 🎉
❤
5:21 the cinematic of the F8 and Huracan under the tunnel was insane
This guy has Saul Goodman number.
Anybody else think the "cool" factor is gone. Same shit different video bro. Was funny like 2 years ago homie.   Just so everyone knows. Dude below who commented wants to give everyone a free truck but you have to pay 300 dollars for shipping jana
bro playing forza horizon in real life
Convert it to a rally drift car
Forza Horizon in real life
Think lil Pump may have beaten you to it with Ferrari
Kind of looks like a Ferrari commercial. Ferrari prolly paid a lot for this video and so did the bubble protector thing because it did do a great job. Awesome video I love your content.
I've always wondered what happens when you shift to first gear at highway speeds. You don't mind trying do you?
This dude was in a field trashing cheap trucks, Now he's trashing ferraris with a garage full of cars,  awesome
Clickbait
Beautiful car, amazing video
Ferrari be like : well i guess another person to ban from buying my car
farrari wont lets his grand kid buy a car💀
Bro email this to every millionaire 😂😂😂
Learn from Mr Beast and help the people in need, and you reck a 400k car just to destroy! Lame🤦🏻‍♂️👎
The Ferrari's logo is litterally a horse, that's where the horses belong.
Can you do a dually endurance test
Ridgeline

First time l have watched this channel. What a knobhead this guy is.
Where have you been? I miss the uploads
Hes doing what everyone does in forza

And people say driving supercars offroad in Forza horizon is unrealistic. That Ferrari handled that muddy hill like it was nothing.
You asked me my Dodge ram for moving some stuff. I just finished fixing it... just take care.. it is my daily.. ok!?! https://youtu.be/dD6kksP4a6M Best regards, Mike.

Pretty good advertising for that bubble tbh

I mean, he didn't destroy it. Hoped for much more from the title and articles... Nevertheless the editing is godlike level of being funny :)
has Ferrari seen this yet?
King of zero fucks. Legend!
As a Ferrari owner (360 Modena and the 812 Superfast)   I was very hesitant to watch this video, but  was very relived you didn’t wreak it.  If you wreaked it on purpose, Ferrari might ban you from ever buying another one. You can’t do more Ferrari stunts if they ban you from getting another one.
Ferrari accidentally made a good rally car
https://youtube.com/shorts/dMmcu3AVLyk?feature=share   For your destroying all squatted cars vids

Forza Horizon in real life 😌
Ugly geezer that had not enough attention throughout his youth.
If unlucky even a car also have to suffer like this ferrari.
I thought  i would only see this in beamNG
Real Sigma
This is why God hates rich people and materialism. A person would dream his whole life for essentially what others just destroy because too much money. This is why God wont allow the rich into his kingdom tells you you cant srrve him and mammon. Spoiled kids. Clueless. Parents think goving their kids many presents under a tree makes them great parents. They are terrible parents. This guy makes money off ☠️  Do not envy those who do evil…
I don't know how to feel about this, it is painful and satisfying at the same time... 😅🥲
lift kit, monster truck wheels, make it happen!
Me in any car in fh5
yup normal day off roading ferrari
i dare u send the car to sarawak and give to me the car.
I never know how to feel when watching these videos... all I can say is Cody is doing what we have always wanted to do... without knowing it!
But why ferrari why not bugatti, koenigsegg?
So cool that you are using the Hilux's
Me after getting a new car in GTA 5.
Ooh that FJ40 in the beginning was gorgeous

The real question is: how on earth did he buy the Ferrari with a Lamborghini in his garage? If you have a Lamborghini, Ferrari will not let you buy one of their cars. Petty, but then again, he could've bought it private party?
did you get sued yet ? 😂
Straight outta forza

Best car bubble commercial ever

My heart. 😢

I hoped for some high explosives or at least dumping 1000 rounds of .50BMG in it.
Ferrari should honestly use this as an ad for durability
You know what you should do you should try going out to homeless people and buying the what ever they want
Grinding wheels are just heavy duty cut off wheels
Show Pony to Work Horse.

While Americans are struggling this Dipshit is destroying exotic cars... Never lied your content

If you are interested just let me know, im trying my best to get my dream. Peace!!!
sarebbe troppo facile dire cosa pensa di te tutti gli italiani............... un consiglio non venire mai in italia.........................
Is it just me or should whistlindiesel make a video with upchurch
😓 This is an INSULT and an unrespectful action towards The Caballino Rampante and the House of FERRARI at Maranello. 🤦‍♂️
@13:16 THAT HAS TO TOP MY 2023 LIST YET THIS YEAR!!!! WELL DONE LMFAO
Very stupid 😡👎
Love the video.  I think you should try to find a 1967 Shelby GT 500 and make a video😎
you waste all this money but have yet to do anything real with it that matters. you just a ugly kid
Che porcata!
You will never be allowed to own one EVER AGAIN....🤣🤣

У тебя столько бабок на эти машины и ты их просто уничтожаешь.лучше дай мне немного
Without the destroying
Store mine in the outdoor style. Has done well the last few years...
you just confirmed you are an idiot ...
You legit at this point in Cody's YT career, get content like this pretty much anywhere. Watching this man thrash a F8 is honestly gold. Ferrari can eat a dick if they feel differently about it.
Hey man, buy my Jeep to destroy it :P Wounded vet here and I need a new, more practical car, for my family of 5. lol
Putting it under the Lamborghini cover is hilarious.
The tank hopefully coming in a fuew weeks can’t wait bro 😎
Damn bro let me get it if you don’t want it
🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗
You missed throwing the kitchen sink at it. Everything else but that.
You are summoned at court.
I was wondering why the Ferrari driving on the gravel feels reminiscence... then I remembered they almost participated Group B at some point.
ok! it's ok to destroy a ferrari, the money is yours!but you can't spit on the ferrari logo, it was chosen to comment on the disappearance of a young boy in the war,and like spitting on his grave.
Ты украл идею из моего видео?!
Real.

Squatted Ferrari
Meanwhile in the Midwest…
Bro this shenanigans got me cracking up!!!! 😂😂😂 can’t wait to see all the Ferrari fans get triggered 😂😂💀
Honestly video is funny and it definitely triggers some people. At the same time, spending 400k on this car to trash it is just kinda lame. There's people who cry over a couple hundred bucks and this dude drops 400k just to abuse it. Coulda used the money for something better.... but for what is worth it is pretty interesting to watch lol.
went from a duramax to a ferrari
"I always bring protection" -thicc-fil-a 6:01
Why isn’t this video trending!!! 😂
There's people in Africa that don't know if they are going to wake up and have something for their children to eat  And here's this man destroying a car worth more than the average human will see in their entire life Something is just not right

Why don't you gift me then 😭
This guy really drove a Ferrari like a atv

Best ad Ferrari ever got... Or should I say the Bubble?
MANS PLAYING FORZA IRL
no davvero questo no perché su ste robe mi girano le palle pensate di essere simpatici ma siete due poveri coglioni che hanno dei soldi da buttare allora distruggono una ferra penso f8 tributo
This is painful to watch, but at the same time i just sat and smiled the whole time.
if I were the manufacturer of that bubble thing I'd ask you for rights to this video so I can advertise my product :D lol
I love Ferrari
If true, sell it and give the money 💰 to a school , medical centre or the poor. And put that on YouTube.
Aside the law suits, I always loved Ferrari. From the F1 team to all their cars, I love them.  I grew up in dubai and went to Ferrari world every summer and loved it every time.  And somehow this video made destroying my childhood dream car brand something enjoyable. Truly a work of art.
needed this laugh today 😅
where are you getting all this money?
8:03 pov me in forza hrizon 5 🤣
Poor Ferrari 😢 so beautiful
Threw everything at it but the kitchen sink smh 😂😂😂
Hey lads, do not even neglect any expensive Ferrari unless you want to AWD race mod that car for Ferrari races.

Even if you swap your ferrari around a tree I will still pay you my entire life savings 😂😳
I loved every second of this video fuck yes
Tell me you’re to rich without telling me you’re to rich
Ferrari doesn't  need to sue him..they need to hire him to test out future models..this was the greatest  commercial  for them to sell their cars and for sales  of the magic bubble  car cover 😉
Man has a lambo cover on a ferrari
13:20 bro i cant XD XD XD
He’s my hero!
#ferrari @ferrari
This is what forza horizon looks IRL
I'm saddened by the fact that you didn't toss your dildo at the bubble. We all know with its enormous size, it would have destroyed that car.
Based
You should change your name to Whistlin-B-Hole
I love you and hate you. (Writing from my moms phone)
This how all sport car tests should be
More money than sense

Whats your problem bro ?
Like why are you trying to provoke a company? They can literally google your network and sue the living pans offer you.
If I pay nearly half a mil for a Ferrari ain’t nobody telling me what I can and can’t do it fr
Loveeeeee ittttttttttt
Sou do brasil e sou seu fa ❤
It. Sounds. So. Amazing. The way it echoes through the trees is insane.

Hello my dear friend
Cars definitely worth the money.

Long ago I was thinking this guy can't come up with anything better after taking monster Max into the ocean. Every single video after that has been un-f******-believable❗️  🔥☠️💣☣️Best Channel on YouTube 👐👇💯🔥☠️💣☣️
All the big stuff are thrown by whistlin himself 🤣
Если ты породистый америкос, то у тебя сразу бабла ддохуя, возможностей, и ваще все все все к херам круши ломай дорогое и тебе похуй)))

How bro how this dude can do this ?
“Never been abused, no lowballers no tire kickers I know what I got.”

What type of ferrari model is this
You just talked on everyone that gave your freedom.. pussy
I've always wanted to know what it would be like if a 2-year-old owned a Ferrari
Honestly, fuck Ferrari, but I can't help but wish I had $400k worth of 'fuck you' money.
Wheres the lawsuit
no-one*  me in Forza Horizon
4:40 Just make a list of everything I destroy & send me a bill. Dudes like, page 21. 🤣
drop it from a helicopter with the bubble on it, i bet it'll be fiiinneeee
Like a cartoon 😂
I’m not even subscribed to your channel and your stupid fucking videos. Keep popping up. I said it once I see it again your father should have pulled out and your mother should have swallowed.
The no. Of ladders this guy has 🤯. More than those at Walmart
Alot of Ferrari fanboys crying right now 😂  Keep it up man, make them mad
real life grand turismo lol lovin it. they're nice looking cars. but this is  truly the only way to find out what kind of beating they can take # send it
Moron
I went to see a Ferrari do a off-road rally so badly.
Honestly, not mad considering how over priced of these cars are... and 2, there are so many cooler cars out there than a Corvette. Also, the average human on their lives to be about 80 years old so everyone freaking out about a car that's enteopic in nature makes me laugh.
Everyone should have  friends like these guys
I like your content but not a brand new one
Pourquoi il fait ça ce fils de pute
Best video on the internet today.  Trolling Ferrari 😂😂😂🤣
Complete savagery! 👍🏻
bro this aint forza horizon 💀💀💀

Legit rally car !!
This is something i would do in forza its inane to see him doing irl
Real life forza horizon
The fact he drifted it like it was nothing was everything

You wouldn’t dare buy a Land Cruiser.

So forza is accurate, you can hill climb a supercar🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ferrari: You got any fucks to give? WhistlinDiesel: …
Since it's so airtight in that bubble, can it float if it floods??? That's the real question...
😂😂 YESSS
Humans☕️
Fuck Ferrari me harder dad
I guess the ad’s for that bubble are legit cause that thing actually held up better than I’ve thought it would 🤣
Me reacting at 5:40 ; [:o] only to realize the kid in the background was reacting the same way ahahaha
That was impressive I’m sold we’re can I buy one again 😅
I wish Bam Margera and Johnny would visit him
Forza horizon players when get bored be like

Useless guy...
This nicca is a ass bey 😅😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Next vid:I buy the earth and destroy it in 24 hours
Yeah can a company actually do that? My opinion is my car, bought and paid for and I can do whatever I want to it, I could blow the mf up if I wanted, it's my car
Forza is getting so realistic
I think you will completely destroy it. Maybe offroad " testing". I wondered how a supercar would react off-road.
Your tank is on its way from England https://youtu.be/BN8FSJUlbrE
Is this guy stupid bro that’s a lot of money wasted
is this advertisement
this is what you do when money rains 😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️

Lambo hood for the Ferrari hahah
You are stupid
The fact that he covered the ferrari with a lamborghini cover
THAT IS SICK!!! <3333
This is real life gta V

This was sooo fun to watch :D Made me smile when you did a bunch of offroad with it
2 wheel drive on Italian trash, shocking(not)
Bros just playing Forza irl
I’ve actually always tougt that Ferraris are expensive just for their brand and engines. Never tought they were so durable😅
Gettare perle ai porci
this was a funny video. But next time, just take $400,000 in $20 bills and light it on fire.
I think Ferrari put you in client’s black list
Idiot with Money, all i can say...
You're an imbecile
Why is there like 150 cases on the wall. What’s in those cases ?
Me in gta:
It really hurts to see this
Closest thing to Forza Horizon IRL
buick lesabre is what you need to do next. Their amazing farm cars
Anyone else open up YouTube today and think “dam… it’d be cool if whistlin diesel uploaded something today…”❓
Oh man, my butthole puckered every time that car got damaged, even though it's someone else's car and someone elses's money, this is hard to watch haha! Damn tho! Next time, instead of driving it, just send it to me. I'll drive it until the gas runs out and then I'll sell it so I can continue living on hot dogs and ramen.
I wonder if Ferrari commented on this video.🤣🤣🤣
Destruction made in France https://youtu.be/nwO5u6rEYO0
It's like your A punks punk. If assholes had an asshole it be you.
9:41 is a rally on a different level

We need a cave update lol
Brooo this is your garage? Been seeing the cars on cars & bid be taken photo in front of that background :o
Ferrari banned you😂
Ferrari lawsuit coming
Throw an anvil at the car bubble shield. 🤔
Now I get it, whistlin diesel is the @JerryRigEverything of cars. This is actually funny with the Ferrari.

Stupid and no sense
https://youtube.com/shorts/-xZpGxqMOZM?feature=share
Your killing me im going to the army just to live good n breaking rarris 😢wow
I never ever post stuff like this, but can the community get together to make this guy who has stage 4 cancer help finish his dream of building his car before he inevitably passes. His name is Jim Hiscott, if you look up his youtube channel you will see him, and his story and how just a little bit could help, we all really want to see him finish his car build before he passes 😔
This is just stupid.
People waste money like it's nothing
You should squat the Ferrari like one of the trucks what a terrible accident 😂
Who edits give that dude a rais 😭🙏🏼🤣🤣
Why's he wearing fatigues? playing army or what?
Just wanna say man. LEGEND
Teach me your ways on how to get money
That Doug Demuro “Thiis” part stole a sincere laugh from me
Ferrari is definitely gonna put Wdiesel on a terrorist and fbi most wanted list lol (Ferrari's most wanted) lol he has some balls tho gotta hand it to him
The lambo cover lmaooo
Therapist: You don't have to be scared, Ferrally doesn't exist. Ferrally:
Salut tu a pas moyen de fair comme mr beast et fair traduire tes vidéo en français (je suis fan )
I used to work for the oldest Ferrari dealership in the US, I have to tell you, destroying a Ferrari is not at all hard. I've watched people do it without even trying. They were really, really successful at it too.
Will it blend?  That is the question
Magari mori
That screwdriver at end😂
4:21  is there a Supra A80 behind?
Sounds so good
🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂
ferrari remove this guy his car
So the company that produces this bubble shield doesn't use WD for their advertising why?  "Get our bubble shield. Why? Because it can protect a Ferrari from Cody, it can protect your car from whatever it might encounter. Bubble Shield."
:((
Bruh stop the cap ,you don't buy any cars , they lend them for free to you for ads and you don't buy shit , spoiled nerd stop clic baiting
I've never wanted a ferrari more in my life
This thing needs a diesel swap
I freakin love this channe
Follow the 10 commandments Christians and ask for forgiveness and repent from your sins!!
Forza Horizon searching for barns be like
Mad respect on this. Ferrari needs to get the picture and understand you make cars people can buy let them modify or do whatever to it. It's in your possession it's your Ferrari point blank period
I had blood tears in watching this🥲
ferrari are def banning you from buying more of their cars after that one 💀💀
"If u can dodge a wrench u can dodge a dodgeball."  Everything but a dodgeball thrown!  🤣
me skipping to the end of the video to confirm the clickbait.
I’ve subscribe to your channel 4 times in the past year YouTube keeps unsubscribing me it’s getting annoying.
Next Bugatti please 😁😁😁🙏🏻
You forgot one thing that you didn't throw at the perfectly bubble wrap Ferrari....   Cinder block
I actually want to say thank you guys for this video. Don't know how Ferrari people gonna react on this one, but I would definitely tell you big thanks. In this exact video, we can see how the car is performing in dirt, hills and off road, how it handles tough driving conditions. That's a good example of how you need to show the world if your product is good or not. Big thanks to the team 🙏🏼 🙌 💪🏽
so stupid... i love this
This is a really really good video this is got to be one of my favorites 🤣
13:28 the nabers   tf dude
It's your fucking car. Why sue someone who bought a car from you
Nice
This is the very first video of him I've ever watched and I found it in FB and I'm glad I did
the gunshots at the end xDDDDD
bro got the supra in the back. yoooooooo
This is 101% Ferari Review, everyone should buy it
Very well built car ngl
Can I have it when you're done with it?
Well no death of a yuppie car.

This Car doesn't matter!!!!
Bro you Hunt Down a guy that stole somthing from ur dad 15 years ago but u dont give a crap about a 400k Ferrari HAHA
WHY??????? I mean I just don’t understand…..
dude the moment the sharpie came into frame, I knew the horse was gonna get excited
OMG
WHY?
I'm not a hater but I'm Italian and I can't see nothing like this because Ferrari is a piece of art and for a single car like this there is a lot of work
MAN WHAT ARE YOU DOING !?!??!?!??! PLEASE YOU HEARTING MY LITTLE HEART .....
This dude is Anti Mr Beast.
I want one of those bubble things.   That was insane!
Phone : 400 missed calls from FERRARI.
please please please off road test a s550 mustang gt (newer model)
3/10 not destroyed
Dose anyone see the supra in the backround
“Here we are now, entertain us”
How just how
I want to see how many people you needed to throw all that shit consistently att he end 🤣
It's great because no one else would do this 🤣🤣 gotta respect it
dear stupid, I don't have the faintest idea of the meaning of this video, not so much for having abused and despised a "jewel", after all, with your fucking money you can do what you want, but your complete lack of respect for people who maybe they don't even have the money to be able to eat, it shows how much degradation there is in today's society that they have created idiotic people like you, who are allowed everything! I would  put you  in jail and throw away the key..maybe making a nice video to upload on You Tube! but I think you didn't even understand what I'm talking about, because you missed your only neuron with this video...unbeliavable...
Fuck Ferrari you paid for the car do whatever tf you like to it
my man got a sub just for this from me. this dude a menace
Its your money etc....I jist can't stand this. Was it really needed to "show the guys in Italy what I can do" instead of maybe put the same money into something better? I dont know,but US got pretty harsh medical i surance system...for 400 000$ you could literally save some kid's life....Just for example
Turn it into the next monster max. Put the Ferrari on a truck frame 😂
You Waist money
What is the first thing that comes to your mind when i say ferarri: oh uhh fast red sports car: no keler crashing and lawsuits
Farreri or ferrari?
A Ferrari under a Lamborghini cover 😂
Лучше бы мне отдал
Honestly honestly HONESTLY, let's see what the folks from Italy has to say about this video and we can all grab some popcorns and laugh.
how much money does this guy make...?
I mean,Some one have to do it 😂
Maybe I'm too old. I really waited at the end for a kitchen sink.
what a fuking degenerate, people like this is the reason humanity needs to be nuked and the world start over... Eat the rich
been two weeks and its still up, no take down notice yet
I SUMMON THE FERRARI PURIST!!! NOW SCREEEEEAAAAAM IN AGONYY!!!!!!!!
You forgot the kitchen sink
Apart of me wants to believe that you secretly invested in that car bubble company, before shooting this. (Sl)eazy money.
Boring.
Seeing a Ferrari drift in the outback’s on a muddy road during a thunderstorm is the coolest ducking thing I’ve ever see 💯⚡️
Took what bam did with his lambo to another lvl. Some will never get to even set in a car like that some get to destroy them like a cheap toy

Tax the rich channel did this much better a decade ago...with way better cars...water skiing using an F50 etc...
bahahahahahaha
13:30 sounds like Saudi Arabia
This guy is a madman and that is why I'm subscribed. Almost at 5M brother.
Need for speed real life
Can i have the motor? I wanna stick it in something stupid like a go kart or a mini jet boat or a unicycle and ping it off the limiter. Send to Australia. Cheers in advance 😆 🤣  Edit: I meant once the Ferrari is a F   a i of course and a steaming hot mess 😆
Damn if you got too much money buy me a Ferrari
What a Jerk
What? No kitchen sink?
Such a stupid boring video
Btw I hate you🤣🤣
WD had that fuck you money lol but at an entirely different level. He can say fuck you to Ferrari?😳🤣
13:18 I love how the items just get more and more random.
Meanwhile some people dont have money to eat....And this guy destroy a 400K ferrari instead of helping is community...
one question tho is the ferrari or the bubble bulletproof?
You should do crash up derbies with subscribers. Winner gets a car or truck lol
I love how you are still seeming like the same person even after u got alot of money.. u just started spending more money on your "joyrides" haha
People being pissed off with this car getting messed up need to realize this is to just rub salt on the fact Ferrari say's you don't actually own the car if you mod it
Sweet looking car lol
i like ure face ... prob u where a fatso cry`n 4 candy`s all day ... now ... the grown fatso .. haz other hobbies =))))))))))) lil fatso :))))
In the meantime, I’m selling my awesome 1993 Silverado K1500 350 5.7tbi with a recent custom paint job, in mint condition, for $17K, and I’m hoping that whoever buys it takes great care of it, like I have. BWAHAHAHA
Damn I want that mf
Fucker sounds cool, though
Looks like forza
Bro This GTA V Graphic Looks Insane
Been waiting for another video like this. I really enjoyed this one bro
Give me a hammer lmaoooooooooooo ZATINTHEODORE 🗽
Fifth wheel pull with Ferrari… and fill that bubble with water!
💪😎  destroy 🤟😎
TAXTHERICH100 would be proud
WHEN U GOT MONEY ... THE POSSIBLITIES ARE ENDLESS 🌟💰🌟
This is like in GTA when you take your super cars off-roading😂
personally i find that if you were to destroy a Ferrari i find myself less mad then when you fucked the Hilux. mainly because fuck Ferrari for placing guidelines on what i can do with my own property.
Still less sensitive than Ford who will program new cars to be repo'd anytime you hurt Ford's feelings.
smart man he did it all on his property what case doe they have?
I would’ve liked it more if you actually destroyed it like you did the skyline but ok whatever clickbait
he need those lawyers feesi just need yall to tip for yall food fk😂
Can I take this baby to prom? Love me some rari
Prepare for lawsuit incoming…. Ferrari  going to milk u for proving their quality is trash
BRO WHY DID YOU DO THIS THAT IS TOO Freaking Nice
I was hoping at the end they were going to throw a rubber chicken
😂 finally someone had balls to show Ferrari baby seaters how it’s done! Well done! Destroy this garbage and park it in front of Ferrari dealership ! So they can cry some more!
Lol, dude did the equivalent of buying my house just to rip all the drywall and flooring out.
Cody I got a 2011 ford fusion that runs fine that you can fucking destroy idk if you’ll answer lmao but that’s content
Now I want one🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣❤️
Literal definition of enjoying your life
Why??
You need to turn it into a rally car, ship it to Finland, enter it into a rally race, hire a pro driver to drive it, and you need to be the co-driver/navigator. Maybe Mikko Hirvonen isn't busy.
I don't know if I mentioned. Dude is a good driver
bruh i woulda taken it
Why just why would you rally a Ferrari
i think this guy likes electric cars...
Wd working with Ferrari?🤔
Ferrari air compressor made me die out laughing
I fuckin love this kid......
I just want you to know that ever since the video came out exposing your past.... you now have my full blown commitment. I just subscribed. And I am here for ever now bro. (come test that in 10 years when no one else is around, I promise you I will still be here.) I understand now. I didn’t understand it before.
The sales on the car bubble are gonna sky rocket now
Thank you!!! I can't afford a Ferrari to smash up, but I've always wanted to... you are a legend!
bro i waiting for a car too be thrown at it
clickbait never watching you again
I'm going to go out on a limb here and say you did not have to work for the money that allows you to live the life you currently have. I think if you had, you would have a lot more respect for the things you can afford.
I want to know where to get those crates on the back wall. They look handy.
The car bubble was very impressive
when they realise they could have done a video where they pick up chicks and then destroy the car
Super
it s a shame this guy has no idea of value in life... f..... morron. :(
13:20 literally just a bad band
How can Ferarri sue you for something YOU OWN YOURSELF. YOU BOUGHT IT, IT's YOURS. Like can Apple sue me for destroying my iPhone or dropping it on the floor? NO. F Ferarri.
I'm here to find out what's in the tower of military storage totes 🥺🧐🤔
This is painful to watch😂
I was waiting for a pit bike to fly at the bubble..Or a test dummy fired from a cannon.
Hello brother, I want help from you.  I am from Iraq, Baghdad. I need 100,000 dollars to buy a house. This is the dream that I am dreaming of. Please help me. I have no help. I will be grateful to you for the rest of my life.
Imagine being able to play gta in real life
If you paid for the car then what right do they have to say what the hell you can do with your own freaking car
I literally love and hate this man
5:52 reminds me of me pulling up to the heist in gta
The funny part is I plan on making my own car company once I do I’ll send whistlendiesel some cars to abuse and test out couldn’t get a better durability test than that lol 😂
If I ever see this guy he's getting punched in the mouth and I would.
Close up the car in the bag with it running and let it pop
13:54 that ladder hit the back 😢
I don’t even know what to say fr lol
I’ll take the car once your done wrecking it. 🥲
Ferrari lawyer bout to have a field day
Humble pibe
Help this man
If you search up Square body halls 32,000lbs of logs you can see a john deere skidsteer just like the one that was stolen
Hey this channel is really give some giveaway? And asking for password bank account?
Hey WhistlinDiesel, Im getting my license soon and you seem to not give a FUCK about your ferrari. How about u just gift it to me for free? Deadass, you don't even need it, you have tons of super cars either way, just give it to me and make some content out of it.
pain
At the end they should have nailed it with a spud cannon.
egg
0:04… I love the logo and the misspelling! 😂
dont like that shit at all. Yo i love cars. WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO A FERRARI??!?!!? ALSO THE CLEANING YOU DID... MADE SO MAN SCRATCHES
Can you give me one? Instead of destroying it haha 🙃
But have you tried blowing bubbles AT the bubble?
I enjoy this video sooooo much, you made my day. Thank you.
this makes me so happy because ferrari is so pretentious.
That was a dope video, only thing missing was a lineup of you guys at the end with paintball guns and then a scream that said: OPEN FIRE! While all you guys shoot it to end the video
whistlin i own a 2006 chevy silverado 1500 single cab , i would love for you to find the same model and beat the living hell out of it. i wanna see that
Let’s make him get the F90 m5
I wish I could work for Cody
That’s one crazy SOB😂
Is it just me or did this do incredibly well in the dirt when it’s 100% made for a street or track? 😂😂 makes me want a Ferrari that much more tbh
Hey just pay me those money rather than destroy it wkwkkwkwk
Wrap it around a pole (safely?)
Ferrari is the law
Was für ein dummer Idiot!!!!!
Where the kitchen sink?
I never thought I would see someone offroad a ferrari
13:10 - that was 50 seconds?!
Idiot 🤮!
Ooooooo now I want one of those bubbles :O
i mean...i'll take it off ya handz
It must suck to be able to buy whatever you want and not appreciate it, I bet you were one of those brats that smashed your toys when you didn't get what you want! Oh and it doesn't matter how many $$$ you have your still a frustrated LOSER!
You've come a long way, makes the Nike episode look like child's play.
whistlindiesel bring the bleu f-350 limited EDITION🤔
you should have a tug-of-war monstermax2 vs a tank
This guy has a lot women face features :)) lol
Me in forza
Me in forza horizon 4
If he had earned the money from hard work, he would never do it and post it. Just because of easy money from YT, he could do it. What a looser.  Spoiled rich kids. It's sad.
Cease and assist😂😂😂  some 🍑s are gonna have a fit
This video has me so hyped.
forza eliminator mode irl lmao
Where can i buy that bubble garage?
put dem steel carriage wheels on dat!
This is probably one of the greatest car videos on the internet at the moment, love the ending😭🤣
Sorry mate, it's not funny to destroy such a beautiful car. 😢😢
*does burnouts* "i DESTROYED a ferrari 😱"
I THINK YOU FORGOT TO THROW IN THE KITCHEN SINK
The only thing left is to shoot some guns
we need a lift kit and some chunky wheels
you should fuck up a first gen chevy curse
Can I just get the next one before you destroy it ? 😂
Any law suits??
The second half of the video felt like Forza..
Goes to show you how truely amazing Ferraris are built
I’m disappointed you didn’t throw a kitchen sink at it.
Just watching WD killing it shows me how much my 15$ an hour job suuuucks 🤦🏼‍♂️ I really should have made better choices growing up or I should say growing older 😂
Nice Subaru
Lol W vid. Always has a smile on his face.
Ferrari. Worlds best Off Road 2wd vehicle!
hey motherfocker, buy a bronco raptor and make a video of the durability test
Definitely my favorite video. That's what Ferrari gets for telling people what they can and cannot do with their own money.😂
you should buy a stance car and do your thing with it
idiot
Me when I play Forza Horizon
Seeing this do a rallycross event would be the best thing ever!
Bro I fucking died & came back to life when they “shot” at that air balloon
Should be a race car driver and sponsor Ferrari in my opinion
If intrusive thought were a person:
I want that bubble
Send it to Ukrainian army, pls
lots of people say that they smile while watching but im just sad :(
Great way to sponsor a protective car bubble Lmaoo the caution kids at play sign go time laughing
I really thought you were gonna come out with the kitchen sink to throw on the bubble..lol

2:52 I dont know why this made me laugh so hard XD
I've been waiting for this none can't wait I fucking love what you do bro
Well...

bambino
When I see this it hurts inside but is funny tho 😂
forza horizon 5??????????????
I really don't understand how there can be such stupid people in the world.
Did Ferrari ban you from buying another Ferrari after this?
Do you have any idea how sick you guys are???
Destroy is and send it back to Ferrari pieces
TBH this is a great Ferrari Rally add
Takie cudeńka się podziwia a nie niszczy co on ma w głowie 👀

I can't believe you missed the opportunity to throw a kitchen sink at it. Fail.

GRATUITOUS MISTREATMENT IS SO FUNNNNNY, HA HA LIKE YOU'RE ALL 14-YEAR OLD MONKEY BOYS . "Oh we're all so cool doing stuff that will piss people off! Notice me please!" Next he'll buy the Mona Lisa to scribble on it then torch it. Great content dude, destroying/ what an embarrassment

He is doing rally racing
I am sure that Ferrari will never sell You their car again. They are snobs Edit: I have written this comment before watching. Me: Oh, that's what all the video is about Also seeing comments: We understand Ourselves pretty well
Si tu as 250.000 euros en trop a jeté par les fenêtres moi je m'achèterai une maison

Man is living a video game
Just like in forza 😁
He's like a 2 year old, high on sugar, having a destructive episode with a family heirloom. Just for click notoriety.
You’ve gotta be the most epic YouTuber of all time at this point. I started watching you when putting dragslicks on what is now monster max, and it was entertaining then 😂
That bubble company is going places after this
Maybe they should seek some mental help....🙄
like all jokes aside that protection bubble is the best product to ever be created
This is how cars are meant to be driven >:^)
This was thoroughly enjoyed
Driving in the GTA 5 mountains in real life
This dude spent $400,000 on a Ferrari and I can’t afford to spend $40 in gas to get myself to work next week!!!! I just don’t understand where I went wrong with my life. I work my ass off every day for absolutely nothing. I respect this dude and I love watching his videos I got damn we live to separate lives
Nice video

Ferrari is the biggest babies of the car world
W video
Me sitting around any car with intrusive thoughts taking over
Take it off the jump at the farm. Plz I really wanna see what kind of air time this can get😂😂
Everbody else who buys a Ferarri: Oh, gotta be careful, super expensive, OH NO, I GOT MUD ON MY WHEEL. WistlinDiesel buying a Ferarri: *Jumps on the car and throws everything possible at it*
Disgusting waste
Out of all the Ferrari’s it had to be my favourite car 😭why not do this to a 296 instead 😂
13:17 HowToBasic
part 2 you actually destroy it
2:52 Man i didn’t know Whistlin Diesel’s Ferrari coed with a built in Fiji water dispenser!
I hate you with passion. Actually bro.
when is tank durability test?
Is there any call from Ferrari already? :D
Been 3 years since the F350 anylevel and now look at you
If anyone knows about a rlly cheap Chevy 1500 lemme know I’m still in school and I have a job but I wanna get something and I figured it’s the easiest thing to make look nice

How do me and him have all three of the same ladders 😂
Me watching him drive a $400,000 car like it's nothing 👁️👄👁️
This should be illegal, all that money to throw it on the windows like's nothing...you can do a lot of thing with that money or just keep that car nice don't destroy it
Just your average forza horizon gameplay.
13:19 That was the best cover of the intro of Pink Floyd's "Time" I've ever heard.

Run it over with a hilux
Why ?
The GTR was cringe and painful to watch , this is hilarious satisfaction .
What a sick car to wreck
You know why Ferrari is always in a perpetually revolving door of law suits? Because it's more cost effective with a potential for more revenue than it is to use quality material to build over priced piece of shit vehicles. You are paying for the brand not the product. Marketing 101 in "fair trade" capitalism.
covering the ferrari with a lamborghini blanket... this guy is ruthless
I am sure that when you die, GOD will say, well done my good and faithful servant,  Do something good for your country, you do know where you are, right? The United States of America, you are an embarrassment to this country, you blow hundreds of thousands of dollars and you bring nothing but destruction to a young persons mind thinking of  pursuing a good career in a job that is loyal to our country, instead you teach young people how to be a nothing in american society, and make them think that they can be like you and create a youtube channel that is useless to God and country but purposely created and made to destroy our country and the minds of the youth, you are destroying The United States of America, do you really think God is pleased with you? you are so about your money that you no longer have rational thought of the lives you are destroying, and don't reply with a Hey! thanks for your support and e-mail me at this, because i have a gift for you. Man up and answer why you choose to destroy what is sacred to God.
400,000 dollar car 600,000 dollar video
Such good content. It’s a durability test with fun and laughs.
What are all the cases
https://youtu.be/-ZV1RC_iupk
I want all that pand
Hi whistlindiesel I am French and I follow you on YouTube I find the monster trucks you make cool, but I find that they don't allow you to have enough fun, ie they don't look fast and they look fragile, I think that it would be cool for you to buy a monster truck (the ones seen in monster jam) because with this kind of monster truck you can do big air, bag flip, donuts and many more fun thing… frankly I think you'll have a blast with this kind of machine especially since you all have to have this kind of monster truck, you have the land, the garage, a team to repair, earthmoving machinery to make springboards and put the monster back on those wheels and surely the money to buy it (maybe) These monsters still seem strong enough to withstand jumps, shocks and even when they are on the side you have a chance to put them back on their wheels by accelerating With a little whistlindiesel decoration on the bodywork it would be perfect. what do you think ?
Ferrari CPO Program ready
Mannnnn the company that made that bubble just watched this video and fucking cried....... this is the best advert ive seen in my life, they should send you money
Yo let me have the old ferrari exhaust system, i could sell it and pay for my tuition
Glad you drove the damn thing. Unlike other owners think they can take the car to their grave.🤣
🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗
Wdf.
Do you have enough ladder to drive to heaven on? How long would it take?
you’re going to hell for this
Have you read the ffa fall and winter hand book brooo.  No hate
It feels so good to see just an expensive vehicle get roughened up.
The title gave me a fucking heart attack.
This was great
this guy is weird, such an annoying video!
Bro is playing forza irl
Forget the quality of the Ferrari I want the balloon.
When are you going to get the tank
Tifozzi
It sounds good tho and that rev limiter sounds 😂😮‍💨
The fact he’s just a good drive says it all
Fuck Ferrari :)
Is he on the spectrum
Weirdo
Fun fact: He didn’t actually do anything you see in the video as a real life stunt. All shots of the Ferrari seen in this video were actually taken in Forza Horizon 4 on Xbox X.
Aughhhhhhhhhh
ألا الله يخااك مالك
I’m poor and broke Now can I have it please
i love how it gets more and more violent by the second
U did not destroy it ugh
Ferrari? An unreliable piece of crap
not gonna lie     i cried along
Interestingly enough, this is somehow a lot less painful to watch than to see somebody smashing a perfectly good guitar.
This makes me want a Ferrari even more
y are there so many scammers on this channel comments
bro is playing forza in real life
If was was a woman, I'd give it up to that dude for doing Ferrari.  I still might, though
The first few times I saw you without knowing a thing about you I hated you a lot. Now I realize that was only my problem and I actually understand your videos and really enjoy your content. I cant wait to see what you will do with this red car xD
Would love to see this with a trailer hitch pulling something 😂
:(
You should jump monster max on the jump that destroyed monster max 1
Day 1 of asking whistlinDiesel to buy a Humvee
5:48
It is so funny when they throw all that stuff at it

1:33 Is the key breaking foreshadowing, viewers think to themselves?
May I have some of that extra cash so I can get myself a Ferrari sir? Thank you

One word to describe my feelings: PAIN.
As a representative of Ferrari you are being sued you have one month to give it back or we will bring Mario into this and he’s already mad 😡
Buy my truck please! I wanna see it get destroyed
Very good marketing campaign 😂
Not that 1 subscriber matters but I used to like and aubsceibe to your stuff…. But with all the content on wrecking valuable stuff… and trying to run people off the highway  p😮tying people’s lives in danger for your own moronic sense of fun ….I lost so much respect for you dude.. hope you grow up someday.. officially unsubscribed..
Thought I was watching Forza
Forza Horizon In Real Life🏎
I bet Cody and his team have one of (if not thee) highest view duration on YouTube. Good stuff man, I love this content.
That’s exactly how I drive in GTA
This channel makes me dream of what I'd like to do
The end was like a firework finally. Why doesn’t that look or even sound how it should….
Ferrari would absolutely fit perfekt at WRC !!!!!
feels good to see someone frivolously toss money around while i slave 40 hrs a week to barely make rent/eat.
POV me the entire video: no no no no no, please stop, stop stop stop. AAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!
@ferrari
I hold no value on man made shit, so the fact he does this is IMO awesome.
Y’all need to do a Ferrari durability test
This dude is better than Danny Duncan 😂🎉
forza horizon
bro be playing gta 5 in rea life
The end is amazing. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Purrari
I see nothing wrong, a Ferrari being driven the way it is meant to be driven. Aggressively, fast.
"i hope it's not red" ... 'ohh no"
Waste of time
Wow. What some idiots will do for attention. Lame
I so love this !!
You dont wanted to donate to Ukraine for better guns better armors ammos ?
After he draw on the logo: Bank ammount = -$10T
we need more hilux content
Complimenti ebete pien de schei persone come te non meritano neanche rispetto
Jeep liberty test?  It’s not the toughest but I think (think) it would be a good idea.
Why does it have a lambo cover in the start-
i fuckin hate this guy
Yo cody i think you should buy a humve and destroyt
Should work on that style. Out here looking like a male gigolo
I love cars and I like that sick edits in the video but that "damaging" cars kills me mentally because i have to work just for a phone like 6 months. Its nice content and I actually like it and I don't at the same time. Keep going. <3
Hey buy me ferrari
Based
Good video dont to with other cars onyl ferrari pls
how much money 💰 have u got man
other people need money and you destroy a $400,000 ferrari i'm from poland and our house costs 1 million and you destroy a $400,000 ferrari so please respect that
don't destroy the ferrari $400,000 is two million zlotys in Poland
It’s sad what people do for views….
It hurts ........ But it also feels good...
and there are people that die of hunger......
Waiting for Cody to bought a 918 Spyder and turn it into a Monster truck.
This makes my heart feel all warm and fuzzy 🥰 🤣🤣🤣
@8:52
Imagine we go to war against any country then there’s diesel with his red Ferrari and Lamborghini shooting a mini gun with tracer bullets out of his cars. Imagine
im crying rn leave that ferrari alone :(
And this is real endurance test 👍
if you dont want it anymore ill take the car
Hummer ev next?
At least it held up
These youtubers are fucking idiots
Not going to lie...I could probably use like...a tenth of the cash used to buy thY car..
dont think ferrari build quality is superb  he just went to easy on the old man's ferrari
Hello
just a horse in its natural habitat
greatness
That ferrari is from Tokyo drift
You should do the ending to an owner . 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I believe they themselves stated: "Uhh Yes, you buy the engine. The rest is a bonus"  Eff off Ferrari, he owns it ;D
Ad revenue won't save you
I wish you would do something good for your country, something good for people that have nothing, instead of wasting hundreds of thousands of dollars on a video doing stupid stuff just to get views.
Fuck yeah, man, keep up the good job, I love this thing. I adore how uneasy this video made me feel, keep it up!
I really don't understand how this man can afford to do these things, but idc.
More durable than a Lambo for sure! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Looks like that car bubble company will become filthy rich.
The last part is hilarious i cant stop laughing 😂😂 so much shenanigans flying i was not expecting that 😂😂 great videos lol
Destroy another squatted truck
Успакойте его да кто нибудь!
Bro is for real playin forza horizon irl

Can you do a kt196 cc gokart durability test please

I truly have no idea how anyone supports this.
4 million subs for a video like this. Damn
Please do a Tesla or Tesla cyber truck durability test lol
What happend to your friend Jason?
So do movie producers get sued?
I don’t like Ferrari so was sorta cool to see other than well what I said already
5.7m views that should be breaking even or are earning a little nice!
That would give my life back, still like the content thanks brother 🙏
Man still is fun, but the extremely hard time I’m having you have no idea how life changing that kind of money would treat my illness
It might just be me, but for some reason, if you destroy a $100k truck, I don't like it. But if you destroy a cheap vehicle or a REALLY expensive vehicle, I love it lol. I think its because I really want the $100k truck and its something I can achieve, but a Ferarri is out of my budget. Same with your shop, I don't like when you hurt your shop, I'd love to have a shop like that and don't like seeing you disrespect her! Buttt, if you drop $5 mill on a shop, it would be funny to see you destroy it
This has got to be the best one yet🤣
God Dam that bubble is tuf
as a huge Ferrari fan im highly dissapointed in your decision on how you handle such pure vehicle. but ima hold it in. cuz its your money
Put a trailer hitch on it and tow something
*I do not have any hope in humanity's survival now dang it...*

Everything but the kitchen sink I guess
He enjoyed that car lol
Put the monster truck tires on this
Dude so many people are stealing clips off this and getting way more views thats so sad wtf
I haven’t watched the whole video but I said it before and I’ll say it again there’s something oddly satisfying about destroying perfectly good shit I love it
Next video idea for it, put tanerite in it and yeet a 50bmg at it and let it be the first Ferrari to reach the moon 😂😂
Watching this makes me hate Ferrari even more 😂😂 how down bad do you have to be to make it so someone can’t customize their car how they want AFTER SPENDING $500k THEY STILL WANT MONEY
That air bag from rheford ranger gave him ptsd
How did forza know supercars drive offroad that well? I thought it was just a fluke in the game due to high power and not great game mechanics, but they actually do that well!
Wd is a crip
Forza really stepped up their graphics
He is plainrock124 but more rich
Flashbacks to watching Dodgeball when they started throwing all the tools LMAO.
Forza Horizon in real life
bro you are sick, you have too much money . Some people in the world dont have food but you buy ferrari for destroy it only for fame ...  f*** logic .
I bet that if you would have thrown a kitchen sink , that would have been the straw that broke the camels toe. I mean, that's all that was left to be thrown
if he turns 40 yo we can call him WD-40 for year
Mud riding 🤣 is what i would do with it. Lmmfao

Think of all them Rich guy buying paper weights to sit in their Garage.
I'd love to see someone kick this shit stains teeth in!
Bro is playin forza horizon 4 in real life 💀
this content gives me so much joy
So the real question, not if it is legal, but if you're willing to sell the destroyed Ferrari? Count me in for real!
7:48 Me driving in Forza:
Max Verstappen sosia...
one of the most stupid videos ever. a Ferrari is made to do a particular job - its not engineered for going offroad - just like a 4X4 isn't made to win races on track. Koenigsegg - yeah - but they dont have rumble strips on race tracks so, again, what's the point ?? Are you going to moan next that, with all that power, a jumbo jet cant win at F1 ? I get it with the Ferrari stupid rules, but if you are going to act 10x more stupid, then its does not help.
I wondered what average forza horizon gameplay would look like irl. Now I have my answer.
Sir you have forza horizon 5 as a life. I’m jealous Mr.Diesel
Aaah just 4x4 it and cut the back half off and mount a truck bed! 😂
hope they will ban you for life mate
Shout Out to Jim Carey man
You guys are treating a Ferrari like a çeap and normal car .I always wanted to buy a sports and super car car and after watching this vedio my soul just left my body 😭😭😭😭😭
This video has Forza Horizon vibes.

I’m sorry but this guys an idiot, a rich idiot but still an idiot.
Easy to tell it's just a Pontiac Fiero with a body kit.
Do you realise your on the news
I can't describe the feeling seeing that car drift gravel and push down grass taller than it. That's something else.
When he jumped straight into the front trunk boot and you hear a loud crack noise my heart  kinda died alittle 😳😩🤦‍♂️
There's someone who trolls in the comments saying that they're Cody and that you've won a new truck for their 'new truck giveaway'.  They try to get you to get on Amazon and purchase a gift card or something to buy some merchandise for a couple hundred bucks and then they deliver a new Siverado to your house, AFTER you buy some merchandise.
found you through Tyler. You are my new favourite car youtuber. and maybe person in general...
سوي مقطيع بالعربي او افتاح قناه بالعربي
God damnit what have we become!?!?! We buy expensive shit and just use it as if they’re just disposable fucking pieces of nothing and post it online for views!! Well I’ll have you know! THANK YOU BROTHER I NEED MORE OF THIS IN MY LIFE KEEP IT UP! 👍🏾
I’m very angry and I hate it, but holy shit that was the best video ever
Hilarious I'm glad you know Ferrari gonna try sue you
Boring 😴
The ending sounded like the beginning of a certain Pink Floyd song..
This hurts
I literally hate you
such an idiotic moves.
to quote a friend: you didn't destroy shit! :))
why would you do that? the comments on most videos are a joke...and also you could have spend the money on something much better like charity. Ferrari does overreact some times but its what comes with the brand and they also warn ppl before suing them (most of the time).so fvck Ferrari but fvck you too
Goood 👍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 more more ‼️‼️‼️
Should have got wildcat for this one
Atleast his Ferrari isn't just sitting in the garage he is using it fot something
Freaking a hole I love it lmao 😅 good video

Bro how long till you get sued lmao
@6:58 did he buy another Toyota hilux? The first one got destroyed beyond repair lol
Plees rid my comment
I have always loved Cody’s videos and his torcher test videos are hilarious and more entertaining than most videos on YouTube. But as someone who has a daily driver that barely makes it from point A to point B it makes me cringe when I see all these beautiful vehicles getting destroyed.
Had a whole dodgeball team throwing shit at the car 😂  waiting for part 2
My fav part about this channel is that he’s actually pretty good at driving. Not just some reckless idiot the way he wants people to perceive him
what are you thoughts on my song ? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tAlSXPOvgA
stop  reking good cars :(
13:15 😭😭😭
a dream being destroyed :(
Can I have that after your done with it??🗿

Come out with more💯💯💯💯💯💯
POV: Cartoons 13:19
Slap a WD sticker in the window and put a duramax emblem on it
Bruh why
You are DEFINITELY the hero we need. Now when that special little letter arrives (hopefully) you should do like that scene in Major League, when Dorn hands the manager his contract saying I don't do this and I don't do that.... Mgr proceeds to drop it on the ground and start pissing on it.... Here's what I think of your letter. That. Would. Be. The. Cherry. On. Top!!
now that was pain
Bros playing forza irl
Anybody here from Tyler Wine aka wildcat?
Now I want a bubble
You are the best bro ❤
I don’t understand how that’s worth 400k lol
Seriously only YouTube videos I not only laugh but deep belly laugh. You’re wild Codie.
If it makes you more likely to utterly f it up, then....''OH NO, you monster please don't hurt the beautiful car, it's precious''    I hate Ferrari more than you hate Alabama squatted trucks.
WhistlinDiesel - Buy a Tesla for a 'durability test' except at the end - ignite the battery & involve the local fire department to give them a practice fire. (its extremely hard for them to put out & they pry need practice anyways)
Stg had a smile on my face the whole video shit was badass. I think you should fs keep the Ferrari around for a little while that thing is sexy.
Yooo I love your content, get a SurRon electric dirt bike I bet you guys would have hella fun!
HAhaha the ending video was amazing
🤣Dude that's almost everything in the damn shop.🤣
10 DAYS IN SUED YET

Forza horizon be like…
this is real life forza horizon
If this man doesn't make you think what you did wrong in life, you're watching the wrong person lol
Waiting for the sequel when we see the true durability. I hope this video was only a taste in determining how a Ferrari compares to a Hilux. I have my guesses, but nothing like true scientific experimentation to prove a hypothesis.
bro playing GTA 6 in rl
This is Forza in real life 😂😂
Waiting for Mr. Beast and Cody to go into business together and take over YouTube. Neither one of them care about money, I feel like they would match each other's energy so well 😂

I’m 26 and still take the bus to get to work, I would love to have had a fucking Toyota let alone a Ferrari instead of destroying it
Instead of just destroying that piece of art work. Just give it to me😌
This dude living GTA in real life lmao
These are the type of videos that need to be on the trending page not fucking makeup tutorial for 10 year old boys and coming out of the closet fagot videos that promote your child to be a fucking weiner sucker

What's in all the military cases in the background? It looks like you were filming in Saddām Hussein's bunker. Maybe Bush wasn't lying to us about the giant stash of W.M.D's. But seriously, what's in all the cases?
Can I please have one of these cars after you destroy them ?
Nice video

This is so painful to watch 😭 but we gotta know if it can go off-road 🤣
A 400k car has a plastic fucking roof. Are you kidding me!?
Why are your older videos disappearing?
Thanks for trying this ferrari, I was just about to buy one.
YES! YES! YES! YES!      *YES!!!*      (Yes! This is a JoJo reference!)
This is an affront not only to Ferrari, but to an entire country.  I advise you not to show up in Italy, stupid american.
The fact that this is how theyre supposed to be drived and not babied around
This is how supercar brands should do their ads. 7:50
This was more a commercial for the cover than anything else
This hurt to watch, but I loved every minute of it.
1trilion % idiot
Menudo imbécil
Diamond durability test please

Tell me you've made it without telling me you've made it.

If Ferrari really cares about their image this much than why are selling their cars to onlyfans h*es?
forza horizon real life
👍👍👍👍👍👍😂
So you're telling me the new Ferraris come with a toilet on the front 😂
Ferrari watching this:👁️👄👁️
You disappointed me Sir. I thought you gonna destroy it.
The single most impressive thing in this entire video is the fact that its currently been 9 days and he survived to upload it at all.  I'd expect halfway through filming this Ferrari would be watching you through the microscoptic cameras hidden within the very fabric of the bodywork and then send in their $500k androids by way of remotely piloted military jet to assassinate you james bond villain style.
If Ferrari comes, get er done like this,  Just tell em, I Accept your Offer Under Full Immunity Without Recourse and see what the 2nd response would be, if they mention brand you can mention extortion, libel, etc.... Ferrari did pay tax to export an import yet Ferrari doesn't own the vehicle/automobile anymore under the law bc you paid taxes to on it an if Ferrari say opposite like they'll usually, just say well if soo then under the uniform commercial code and according to Ferrari liability they want well they have to insure your Ferrari instead of you paying for insurance for its technically their vehicle. Its sad that Ferrari plays the private sector game with their customers. Its like a nazi-ism company tbh smh
TaxTheRich has entered the chat
bro got sued
Another reason lambo's are better
Did ferrari sue you yet 😂
احسنت ياصديقي انني احبك اتمناء انت تتواصل معي وترسلي ساره يين كن سعره انا من الاردن احبك 😍
"destroy it" lol talk about a let down bro, why hype the title to only do minimal damage to it lol, we have certain expectations of your channel at this point. Bury it like undergound and rev the engine then well talk lool
They really tried to hit Cody with that hammer
They never let you buy a new one again after this  Ferrari can be very selective on who they sell their cars to .
Cody is playing real life gta
THANK YOU FOR BEATING THE GOD LOVING SHIT OUT OF THIS CAR
Gta online in real life
Someone at Ferrari just got fired for this video.

Hell of an advertisement for the bubble protector 😂

Best Ferrari advertisement ever
New favorite video
I love these video's so much. so painful to watch, but so worth it.
Ain't this that one Ferrari with a cracked frame?
12:47 Notice how it's the only moment where you see him cringe during the video, when he damaged his ladder
I want to hang out with this dude, he begins where most people end , my kinda peeps I own a hotrod hearse.
Hahahaha 🤣🤣🤣.
What an amazing rally car and you didn’t put a scratch on it
This video is just me enjoying the new car I bought in GTA but in real life.
this feels like a forza horizon trailer
Watching this really hurt.. it’s not even like I  can afford one it’s just the principle of it all. .
When you though GTA V was unrealistic because you could climb up mountains in supercars, he just proved us it was actually realistic
You're the best have fun my brother redneck
What’s up man. I’m a humongous fan of yours I’ve watch all of your videos and I can just keep them on repeat all day. You never fail to make me laugh. But if you can if you could help me out I see all of these vehicles you get that are used and I’m currently on a search for a second gen Cummins. I have no idea where to look to find one and I’ve been going on and off of marketplace to see what there is. But I’m also 17 so it’s pretty difficult for me to afford one. But I thought I’d see if I could have your help since I see you get all of these nice vehicles. Thanks buddy, keep up the amazing work. I can’t wait till your next post
this is literally me in Horizons 4😂
oohhhh! ferrari it's hearts
Bro is in real life forza
when u to richh
Yawn.
I love this. I tell people that I like Ferraris but not Ferrari, because they're so lame. You hit the nail on the head here. And on that note, 100% chance of Ferrari taking some sort of legal action in response to this video- mission accomplished.
oh its just a forza horizon 5 unreal engine
a guy can affoard a 400K car just to destroy it, while I have to save UP for a 5k car, people say money doesn't buy happiness 🥱🤚🏼
Watch out they might sue you
Alright this dude makes too much money 😂

After this video Ferrari up for sale. Slightly used on track never on roads 🤣 Only Genuine buyers😉
Wow, for this car i colud have a nice live... one this car and i... wtf guys ☹️ I work for 1000$ per month...😭
That car cover is gonna last longer than the car.
Living the life ❤
6:55 need for speed be like:
Ferrari is going to murder your entire family, and burn down your house.
So you only destroy trucks you don't destroy Ferraris?
Destroy a cheap work truck  But take it easy on a expensive car  What happened to money doesn't mean anything you liar destroy that like you destroyed everything else oh now it means something because it's a Ferrari what a joke
This is hard to watch
Yes finally😂😂😂!!!
YouTube has failed me in not recommending this channel to me before.
So you destroy a farm truck but work destroy a Ferrari what happened to money doesn't mean anything destroy it like you destroyed that truck that's what I thought you won't because you wanna keep it don't you think people won't wanna keep the truck ? You idiot
Dude this is how you drive a Ferrari man!!!!!

Ferrari ASMR
so when you getting the tank?
Thats not the case anymore, Ferrari doesnt give 2 fucks what you do with the car and right now u can tune them like any other car DDE and other channels do so. WELL EXCEPT THE PINK COLOR, and i agree you should be in jail for painting a Ferrari pink.
You’re a fucking retard.  I’ve lost all respect for you as a creator and entertainer. I don’t care if you read this but damn you are wasteful, spoiled and immature. Enjoy your life fuck tard.
Forza in real life
This dude literally plays Forza and GTA in real life
Poor car🤧

I wanna have your money and that's all.
If my company made that bubble,  I'd PAY you for that footage to be used in our commercial.

Ferrari should take advantage and make a commercial
i have a lot of satisfaction watching this and the fact he’s firmly extracting the urine
Non meriti di avere una ferrari non si strattano così le auto per noi italiani la le macchine ma soprattutto la ferrari sono considerate come dei bambini
Waste of money
Every time he threw a ladder on the side and the scream after it 😂
Never seen a Ferrari driven like that before I think I'm falling in love with Ferrari's again they hold up pretty well

Boys... I understand that you have so much money to spend that you do it for views etc etc but mistreating a poor supercar among other things from ferrari... which is almost a cult... Think what they will think of you if they ever see the video...
I don't  have money  for a mercedes but this is EPIC HAHAHAHHAHAH

Always wished I had a ladder like the last one.
It’s my absolute dream to have this kind of money where I can beat the crap out of a super car that I’ve always dreamt of owning 😢
Hahahaha, your crazy man
Start destroying nice trucks again to bring back the gay haters
Cody is playing real life forza
4:07 wtf
13:17 after seeing this, I say that the presented product is worth its price and that it is an awesome advertisement
bro part 2
This guy just keeps coming up with GOLD!!!  I love love love how he is messing with those DOUCHEBAGS at FERRARI!  If someone pays the astronomical price that those clowns sell their glorified C8's for then they have the right to do whatever the hell they want to do with it!  Right on WD!  Easy to see why this is by far the best and most original channel on the tube!
This man turned his yard in to a Forza horizon festival
SHEEEEESH💕
instead of spend to waste sent money
Ferrari on wagon wheels?
The God of destruction strikes again!
Wtf
You have zero respect for expensive items, you should feel blessed that you re able to buy this and what do you do…you destroy it. I shouldnt even be wasting my time on posting this comment but somehow i hope that you might reflect and understand that this is wrong and stupid. There are people out there that cannot afford a bicycle and you re pissing away money just for views. I hope that you never run out of money…
Forza Horizon in real life
Wow what a USD 400,000 supercar  In the MEANtime, I am trying to save money to replace my 160cc motorcycle's timing gear. That will cost me USD 70 plus.  Added : Don't get me wrong... I love Ferrari and this video is reviewing my fav brand of supercar to push it beyond the limit...
it hurts watching this
he should drive high speed and hit the wall .. waste of money
wow
PAYASO...
#laboiserie c'est mieux lui il maltraite les voitures

Just watched the video without sound and the message is that Ferrari can't get hit by anything or anyone, because they're highly protected.
the bunny hop into the frunk 🤣😭
Ferrari durabilty test video, sick🤟🔥 Your smile is the fact that you enjoy this car so much. Good job Ferrari👏
7:45 "we're doing donuts in a fricking ferrari" ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE YOU ABHIMANYU FROM 'STUDENT OF THE YEAR'...
at first I thought you were out of line
0 respect for the engineers, for the company, for Ferrari enthusiasts, but in general for car enthusiasts. You are not a child! Wake up! With that money you could help a lot of people in need and do this bullshit.... America must overhaul its education system. 0 culture
Tbh you probably one of the most annoying YouTubers
Awesome...hope you guys got payed by Ferrari for that outstanding addvertising. 😂
This is so painful   But cool
I have no problem with damaging new cars. But I'm still butthurt about the R32 GT-Rs he killed xD
forza horizon 5 be like 😂
Imagine Ferrari fans watching this🫡
OMG watching this hurts a lot especially wen u like me who dnt own a damn thing.

"destroy" donner la a @laboiserie lui il peut de la détruire
Fun video! However... if you're really looking to destroy a car, you should take it on Gumball :) News to some but Fezzas hold up extremely well these days.
Your car... get over it
No respect for Who built!
this is g63?
Bro if u dont want the car i want the car give it to me i accept gifts :)
someone needs to tag ferrari in this video
I imagine Even Toyota guys are standing from their seats while watching
Ferrari  would banned this man absolutely 😂
Idiot
I got hacked on your video... said I won a prize and lost money stupidly thinking it was you... It's not your fault, but damn this sucks. Have screenshots of the whole thing for proof, but blown, I got tricked. Your videos are 🔥 but this sucked hella...
I bet he going to do a part 2
Forza in nutshell
Pretty normal video💀
Me in gta driving on a hill
Put tractor tyres on it 😂😂
The best comercial for this horse company 😅.
9:30 lol
He has NO RESPECT..... for the poor 🪜 😆😋
IMPRESSIVE !
The “this” 😂
Needs a heavy duty brush guard with a tow wench
Forza in real life be like
I do this every day in Forza
Think you just did Ferrari a favor by  showing how durable the F8 is.
Actually serves more as an ad about how durable and able the car is and how good it behaves onroad and offroad
Drive monster truck on ferrari
The world is f….d up, what an Id.ot !!!!!
Lambo car cover 🤣
drugs???
How it still look intact tho this man just smashed through a fence at like 60 mph
How many lives you could have changed with that amount, think twice before act
I would daily drive that still if you sold it to me for 500$
You definately need a couple litter bags in this baby.
You should try a Ferrari ff and see what is capable
bro is living in a gta lobby
he drives his ferrari like he is playing GTA
bro....... that's my dream car
plot twist this is a Ferrari add
I think bro is bullying ferrari in this video
Broo got so much money Ricch white guy damn
I stopped watching the video before the minute 'cause I couldn't stand his retard's face!
Mr Beast punching the air right now
Can you do this on a LAND ROVER DEFENDER
LOL  WD Style!!!
This is truly one of the greatest and most inspiring videos in the history of YouTube well done 🫡
É tão maluco seus vídeos que de alguma forma me faz bem , já sou inscrito e já deixei o like 👏👏👏👏
I was going to say you should convert it into a rally car but apparently it came rally ready for the factory.
Like playing GTA
Mouth drop while saying wtf
Would this protect it 😂
This really hurts lolol....
Bet they had fun throwing all that at the end😂😂
jesus christ thats jason bourne
FORZA IN REAL LIFE
Bro this video should be an add for that bubble it worked so well
That’s a lot of “camera” cases you got there
Hey I got a deal for you my guy
You should live stream yourself mid court hearing for us
Best video on YouTube right now🤷‍♂️
Wow a Ferrari got dirty... Treat it like your old truck videos, stop milking it
8:13 I can’t tell if it sounds like a greasy triple Polaris or a straightpiped honda civic
Whoa, wish that Ferrari was mine.
This boy is stupid 🤦‍♂️
Him: hunny ill be back later.  Her: okay where you going?  Him: just taking the rari out for a spin on the ranch and maybe up the hill crest 🤘🏻😎
The video is hilarious but I’m a little confused. How could a company sue you for damaging the car that you now legally own? I know nothing about cars so I’m very confused
Who would have thought gta5 makes sence now its possible to go uphill in you're ferrari 🤣
Or just don’t get the sicker make your own and call it good who the hell will know going buy at 120 mph 😂
99 Durango would smoke all of these 😂
😂
this just looks fun
Ferrari might fire a collateral case
anyone know what happened to Jason his camera man that broke his leg?
Thanks for nothing. What’s the purpose?
What's up with your court case? I want to see you shit all over Tennessees bullshit laws and substandard hack job fish cops.
Man woke up and chose violence
Dude this video hurts
Plays Forza Horizon once:
use the Ferrari in a paint ball war!
w
I’ll take it
Dude…
I Fuck’n love it always taking it to the next level!!  🏎️ 💨
Give it a Lift Kit with Off Road Tires!!
you should get a Ford F-650
I think this MIGHT be something he regrets destroying, look how kuch fun hes having with it! Cage it, and make a Rally Rarri!
Ferrari will forgive him for that nice advertisement at the end lol
take a lexus gx470 crazy offroading
Get a squatted truck and smash a helicopter into it and blow it up and sell it in Jars and one of the jars has the diors you destroyed that have a signature .
Throughout the video, I could only imagine that Whistlin had ties with the Italian mafia to be able to get away with a stunt like this. At the end, it dawned on me: all hail Don Diesel.
Drop a car on the bubble with the Ferrari in it to see if it’ll hold
It’s like a action movie but real life
I get it everyone can do whatever they want with their money but this hurts 😢
you should not have it if you are going to destroy it
he's destroying my dream car while laughing why its so unfair 🙁🙁
It's "Ferrari" plastic.
Gonna enjoy watching this thing get mulched later
You obviously have more money than BRAIN ......... What a looser
Tá fofo ainda
did nobody else see that he had a lamborghini car cover on it
As a man who cannot yet afford to slap Ferrari in the face like this, I love you for it.
Did you also intend to get that haircut to match your outfit Private Whistlin'?
POV: me playing forza.
Based
Good thing the dislikes aren’t shown 😂
I like these videos, it’s your money, I don’t care, this is fun to watch.
Forza fr 😢
Bro I LOST MY SHIT when they started launching everything in the shop at the bubble🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1:38 iconic Fj40 ❤️
I already know Ferrari is gonna try to sue
Pretty sad, that money could of helped feed alot of homeless ppl here in ontario!!!
REAPER WHEELS
This isn't about this video but you should test a Duramax like you did to that power stroke and Cummins. I was just watching the Cummins on and laughed the whole time.
I almost feel like this makes Ferraris look better in some sort of twisted way. They're not just beautiful they're also strong and can take a beating. He revved the hell out of it on all different surfaces and it didn't just shut down for overheating diffs or anything.
Guy is a joke. What is the point? Your rich and you can do what you want? Your nothing but a degenerate. Plain and simple. De-evolving humans are becoming. 👎🏼
NOOOOOOOOOOO NOT THE FIJI!
will u buy me a pc
Whistle diesel I love your channel your second video I want you to buy a El Camino if you do I will subscribe I’m already subscribed.
Tell us if you got sued xd
I started watching but i cant on this one. I dont want to see what happens this time
This video has forza horizon vibes
bro is literally playin forza in real life
Honor the lord by being wise with your money
You forgot to throw the kitchen sink at the Ferrari
Forza IRL
why you didn't drop it in a helicopter?
I can’t stand him and I hate this goddamn car! Who do you love?! Who do you love?! You love a car!
This hurts so much and I am impressed how well has the car is done in the grass, mud , gravel you named.
getting itchy for more content hahaa
This man is my spirit animal. i do the exact same things daily. minus the ferrari and the cool stuff. just the sentences that dont make sense and breaking stuff. the amount of things they threw at the bubble killed me
This is one of those special videos where you find yourself crying the whole time.
a fool and his money are soon parted..I can see WD at 60 yrs old in the poor house
There’s too much red.... needs some paint stripper
By far one of my favorite videos! Genuinely curious as to the offroad capabilities and potential concrete carrying capacity of a Ferrari 🤔
Here for the second time...... Any  lawsuits yet????
This guy is a complete idiot
You should make a stickshift fourwheeler 😎
Most of the world is worried about their one meal of the day………. and what we spend and do for entertainment. Great handling car off-road though, considering. 👍
Ill trade you my civic seats for those purrarri ones
Oye mng porgue ere asi con lo gtr32 eee dime pustos vale mucho mng
I'm just trying to get my head around the idea of having so much money that a $400K car is just a disposable play thing 🤯
You should buy a honda civic and modify it😂
Ferrari please don’t sue him hes my favorite youtuber
Ok your out of control 😅
If you don’t care enough anything is an off-road vehicle!
Yo could I get the engine lol
Good you did not destroy a Porsche  911 , your life wouldve been in danger :)
🤮
Ferrari wont be happy haha
10/10 😂 i wish I had your lifestyle man. I know it’s got to be hard with all the hate but keep doing what your doing man 💪🏼
The boys on JackAss were doing this way before this guy.
This is depressing but I like it 😂
Ferrari shouldn't talk and sue customers for how they use cars or how they paint or wrap them but this movie is a bit of an exaggeration a lot of people dream of such a car and here it is destroyed but Well, there's nothing you can do about it, the Ferraris are a little jealous of hating
bro got the Lambo Huracan Evo cover, cuz they couldn't afford a Ferrari one RIZZED UP
The guy face at 4:41 was one of no suprise
Did I miss a video that explains the giant stack of what looks like military crates by the Ferrari
A guy taking a selfie in the mirror with his phone calling you a broke boy.
You lot threw, everything but the kitchen sink at the bubble but lads a #Ninjastar would of burst that 😂🍺
Lol
Mclean and other Cars that propably cost more laughing in the back at Ferrari 🤣🤣💀💀
what has YT become. buy expensive stuff destroy it yay humanity has so much to learn
Most epic video since the creation of videos
That new exhaust made it sound better
Why this guy Is so stupid I mean guys come on all his damn videos are stupid it's just the form how he act and ik that everybody seen it lol big time
Driving it like your playing Forza 5 😂 awesome video 📹
I just need a car for schooling, I trek a mile everyday

Dudes playing forza irl
Dude this video honestly just prooved ferraris quality 😭
ferrally
Cody should have a projective bubble for everything he drives😂 Roll a rock down that hill into that bubble shield with a car in it and see if it bounces! Ha!
Dumb kids:Oh HeS gOnA gEt SuEd
Todays world is becoming so stupid.
Ik u thing is destroying cars but this is easy to watch compared to these cars driving down an Atlanta highway🤣
This is the correct way to enjoy a Ferrari 😂😂
So, when's the cease and desist letter coming?
The mother fucking 🐐
Si tienes el suficiente dinero para destrozar coches que mucha jente quiesiera tener embeds reventarlos regálalos o véndelos
This dude is such a asshole he’s a spoiled little shit he needs his ass kicked
Hi I was sent by Ferrari to talk about your car extended warranty
Ferrari hates this video lol
DIE KARRE IST SCHLECHT DESIGNT. DIE FELGEN SIND SCHLECHT DESIGNT. DAS LENKRAD IST SCHLECHT DESIGNT. VIELE E- AUTO'S SIND SCHNELLER UND DESHALB KANN DAS AUCH KEIN FERRARI SEIN! FERRARI IST DURCHGEFALLEN! MIT DER NÄCHSTEN PLASTIKSCHÜSSEL GEHEN SIE PLEITE.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9XVFWGjaLw

WD ur new car is sick but ur new camera guy is killing his job 🤙🏻🤙🏻 keep it up
Me when i get bored in forza
😂😂😂
Go to hell...
I am actually incredibly impressed with the bubble thingy holding up to the abuse. If I was the person responsible for the marketing I would just upload this video to the website
Why don‘t you buy me a Ferrari?
Whistlingdiesel is the new taxtherich!
Can I come drive it like that bro
Y'all Through everything but the kitchen sink at it
Every WD video that I watch is him destroying something that is worth like 8 times the car I would like to own monetary value.
Bruh that car is fucking dope. Those clips of you driving it made me a fan
I was just waiting for the objects to stop being thrown at the bubble
The only youtuber that plays GTA with cars in real life.
he made 16k to 20k from video and destroys a 400k dollar ..he must get them for free
Ferrari stans for the last couple of minutes: OHFUCK OHSHIT OHFUCK OHSHIT OHFUCK OHSHIT
8:06 Its like GTA 5 in real life, sporstcar driving up a hill full throttle
“If it’s red it’s dead” -WhistlinDiesel
Dudes just playing GTA in real life
Whats in those cases,buddy?
It’s insanely impressive how well it handled going up the muddy hill. Ferraris really are a feat of incredible engineering
Why? Poor car :(
Awesome 😎 ,
This video was banned in Italy
I saw this on tiktok lol 😂 went viral
I am waiting for the next vid.  Saw your instagram post.  I hope you find out if the ferarri can drive on the ocean.
Destroy a toyota ea86
They might not sue you, but they sure as hell won't sell you another one.
Watching this hurts more that her cold dms 😂😂😂😂
a f430 is still expensive tho ;-; i would have been satisfied  Edit: damn
Bro really had a Lamborghini cover on a ferrari 💀😭
They’re running a sale right now 😂
Destroy more modern cars. Save the classics because those will never be made again.

🤦
U know u could write all that fun stuff off on ur taxes just cus u got a business
Wat een ongelofelijke sukkelige loser!
he’s literally playing forza horizon 4
the stupidity of some people never never ceases to amaze me
Hands down one of the best videos I've ever seen on YT
You really kill me Cody.....🤣🤣🤣🤣you are as far from normal as possible....no matter how expensive the car you treat them the same....🤘rock on dude....
its a rental
It’s like if someone drove in real life like I do in forza
Fuck yea man, honestly fuck ferrari.
TaxTheRich will be very proud
Bros living GTA Online life in reality
Yo diesel buy me $500 cash car so I can go back n forth to work before it inevitably destroys itself with my gentle guidance
why that car is so nice why would you do that. But it is fun to watch
You didnt even tractor pull it with the chopper... Laaammmeeeee
It appears Whistling Combustible Distallate Byproduct is more based previously thought
Buy a Tesla and see if it explodes when abused :)
Not gonna lie. I enjoyed this video very much
QUESTION: Did you actually legitimately pay for it OR just bounce the cheque as usual? (No Daddy always does doesn't he?) I learned in Life it is really easy to DESTROY stuff then actually CREATE stuff; you MAN are an example of that- I Hope you feel good about yourself now......👍
👍🥳✌
I did that on gta hahaha
lost all respect for you now thats a good car you just ruined fucking scum bag
Forza in real life
i wish i had a ferrari
That Ferrari has seen more off road then your avrg. g-wagn.
I can 100% tell your not a materialistic type of person I get it you do these videos for views and entertainment and to show those yuppies who are narcissistic and are materialistic that all of it is all b/s which makes me respect you 100 times more Broo
Aaand now your ban from buying another Ferrari 🤣
Sometimes I just wanna slap you then i remember that's your car
5:58 iTS MY ASS KICKING OUTFIT!
Been watching for 3 years. Havent really cringed but this did it for me lmao
Put some spacers on it and like 33s swampers then drive it threw mud
Ferrari should make a commercial for this
Throw a moped,atv,four wheel & dirt bike at it next time
This is epic in the rain too
Where the rest
He is definitely money ain’t shit but still is
this kinda hurts but looks hella fun
Ferrari afraid to got at him with law, because they know he’ll just total the car
My god I need that cover
Forza Horizon 6
Never disappoint 😂🫰🏽
Lawsuits lmfao
Change the Ferrari logo to Lamborghini logo
It's so stupid that they can sue you for something you BOUGHT. That is some bureaucratic BS
The Lamborghini cover is a nice touch.
throw it in a shredder just like the squatted trucks
you actually promoted Ferrari, bigger than you know it.
He got forza 6 early
Me playing forza horizon 5😅😅🤙🏼
could you not just give it to me next time?
Watch Ferrari ban him from buying any car
I'm not a green voter but get this guy that he can no longer destroy anything or pollute our environment.
Idiot!!!
Playing forza horizon in real life..... flex
Más al pedo que bocina de avión estos pibes.
Hey I'm a big fan of your videos
Che idiota !!!!!! E la gente muore di fame !!!!! no hai nessun rispetto delle cose ,dovresti patire la fame il resto della vita che ti resta, cosi capirai !
Mans playing GTA his whole life.
Some people starving to death and other spending ridiculous amount of money on stuff just to destroy it haha isn't this world a curious place?? Good video btw, I enjoy them a lot! (not judging you by any means, you discovered a really cool way to make more money)
7:39 Lancia 037 on Monte Carlo Rally course in street car livery, 1983
Pov: in forza when your too cheap or lazy to fast travel
Forza horizon in real life🔥
400k on a Ferrari but can't pave your driveway. Richy rich over here
Imagine spending all the money to a charity. How bizzare🤥
By far my favorite part is when you ask for the hammer and all the tools go flying
Dobre 🤣
what about anvil durability testing
give me a modified  suppra any day
stupidity of people is really limitless. you must  have so much money to buy somethging in order to only destroy it. Most people around the world dont have even enought money to eat and you just burn it instead of helping those who are in need. You have soooo much money but you are the poorest person i know bro
Nice 👍
I love it you should lift one
hey Whistlin, i saw you on my web-browsers news!?, is that right? i already clicked on one of my quik links, so i couldent properly see it, but it was you with the plastic bubble around the Ferrari...
You are Living the dream 🤘 God is good
Whats the Retail on one of those 🤔 More than you can afford Pal Ferrari 💰 😂
How dare you! You're gonna get sued brohhh
Keep it Up Dude, been watching you for years and the way you handle everything is to be admired. Love it Bro, your a sick Dude 🤣🤘
me when i slightly scrape-bumper falls off ferrari when its ragged out in the middle of nowhere-pristine
Oh my God, this is so awesome ☺️
dumber and not born ..... what a pity for a car and what a pity for a retard
Man y’all don’t understand that this is just purely wrong. This man spent 400,000 DOLLARS ON A CAR TO JUST MESS IT UP!!!! That money could have been given to a family or multiple and them be in a stable position for once. Y’all just dead wrong for wasting money that people beg for and work for everyday of their lives to support themselves or others.
There are a lot of stupid people in the world... plus these ones.
I wonder how many people bought one of those bubbles after watching this video
Do you think it would be possible to jump from a cliff with it ?
Just give me the car
This is the problem with nice things. Only jerks get to own them. Then, you become a jerk if you own one. Just because of their stereotype. *sigh*
thought this was only possible in gta ... this man gives no F's 😅😂😂😂
Next car a tesla model y.
it hurts NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I actually like your video
I don’t like your videos you’re weird
One of the best! Love this one man!
Whistlin  si te sobra el dinero dame 1000000€ espero respuesta va dime algo estoy cansado de trabajar
It hurts
Wow 👍
What a gobshite making crap content for the idiots
mogłes mi oddać
This is badass!! Couldn’t stop smiling through this one ☝️!! 🔥 Keep up the content Cody!! Stay safe 🤘🏻
Needs a part 2 asap
Nice vedio
Very stupid
I though watching jerryrigeverything destroy a new phone was bad enough... 😨😱😭
bro if u dont need that car give it to me pls
100%   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv-Y3q7fOkI
So I don’t need a $400000 car. Just a running anything would be cool, so I can get to work and actually live. Hopefully next video you can get everyone in need a vehicle instead of destroying things people need. Love the videos but I need a car so this upsets me 😂😂
I hope the revenue generated from this video is enough to cover all the repair cost
Can you pls do a durability test on an older Volvo?!!
Thank God you didn't sideswipe the Hilux, that was the scariest part of the whole video. Ferrari's come and go...Hiluxes live forever!
👌🔥🔥🔥
12:18 the way he showed built quality 🙂!
Same type of person who cries when they are broke and don't understand why.
Why!?
9:09 bro HAHAHAHAH WTF
“I don’t earn enough !”  *bank statement* : Spotify, Netflix, Disney, Hulu, Deliveroo, Deliveroo, Deliveroo, ubereats, Doordash, Youtube premium, donations to useless charities 😂😂😂
Common Ferrari L
Don't worry guys he's only going to destroy a Chiron at 10 million. No big deal
Haha how long did it take to clean all the stuff up ?
All the triggered kids in the comments lol, it's his property he can do what he wants with it. COPE
CORVETTE>>>>>FERRARI🗑
You have a very serious problem go see a doctor
Mf is playing Forza Horizon irl
You son of a bitch you just have toi mich Money, People spend years of Work do get a car like This and you think this is funny this is shit
This guys giving me anxiety lol. Man he’s messing it up and I’ve just stated the video
GOOD MAN!! America F Yeah!! You and Emelia Hartford are awesome!! Bell ends like Shmee are the typical Ferrari loser owners
bro try to buy Supra mk4
Should have thrown a Nokia 3310 at it
Maybe Ferrari should look at this video and be like oh hey he did free durability tests for us :P
WhistlinDiesel is the consumer reports for the younger generation
You could just sell it and feed like 20.000 starving people.. but no this is more fun. You could also go take a piss on Mona lisa , that will bring some attention too.
He should be in a Fast & Furious Movie!
🤡🤡🤡
I actually love ferrari, the only company that doesn’t suck dick for money, they know how to annoy rich people, the only thing they care for is their motorsport division
I wanna see it ghost ride the hill
One day a supercar will exact its revenge on you...
I am always surprised by such absurd ideas just to get as many clicks as possible. No thought of appreciation to the people who have worked for days with dedication and love and a lot of manual work on this car. It borders on vandalism, so senseless destruction. Apparently, however, he has also earned too much money too easily, so that this also seems to have no value for him. Those who have worked hard for their money do not just throw it in the trash. 🤔😒
Me driving in gta
Driving it like my GF drives in Forza Horizon😂🔥
veramente un buffone cacataro, ma ottiene quello che vuole, fama con o senza disprezzo, pessimo esempio di vita.
olaga
i love u!
forza horizon is real! you can go cross country in a hypercar! ;)
I want free car can you help me on my dreams car bmw
Ferrari 👎 😂😂😂
Anyone else see the Lamborghini
Them gun shots at the end
Ferraris lawyers have to cut down half of the Amazon rainforest just to have enough paper to type up this dudes lawsuit.
This is crazy I got in a accident on my way to my stupid job and totalled my $37000 truck my life is a wreak I have to get rides from my wife daughter and mother now it took me 30 yrs to get a truck that nice I feel like taking a long walk off a short pier everyday since then I watch u just fk up a 400,000 dollar car I give a shit less about Ferrari and enjoyed watching it but dang I  could of bought 10 f150 with that kind of money and saved my worthless life
Helllo dude, whats up? What are you doing?
I like your rc car
That would of been so fun to do
fucking spoiled brat my heart aches

Try jumping it of a ramp
“We need to be really careful not to hit stuff for the next 10 minutes” *immediately ploughs through gate*
First time I have been impressed with Ferrari quality rather than seeing one "parked" in Hollywood
Nice
💪
Waiting for Ferrari to drop a comment 😂
me when i got too much money in gta
Fai schifo vergognati
W human
Next defender
i cannot believe that 5 Mio. people following such an digusting idiot destroying a car for 400.000, do you ever think of doing good with this money for anything in this world ??  🤮🤮🤮
As a huge fan of these great cars, I must admit: THIS WAS FREAKING‘ INSANE! 😂😂😂
Crazy
This bloke is a deadset fuckwitt. Oh and brush your teeth you pig, they are yellow.
My man is in Forza horizon
Give me some money
You still need that ferrari?
The lambo cover
forza?
Hot wheels in real life
So I guess GTA got it right?
You will be blacklisted by Ferrari🫶🏻
É come prendere la Monnalisa e dargli fuoco che coglione.
:D
Hope Ferrari doesn’t sue him
❤️❤️
It's better that you don't come in Italy. We may kill you. Sucker.
You know you can hurt car lovers by posting that and i know that cause im a car lover
like gta lmao
Didnt u get sued by Ferrari? 😱
that is a lot of ammo boxes...
Ferrari: how about instead of SUING I take some content to promote my cars, (durable) yes, yes use that, (high speed and able to drift on all terrain) definitely say that to our next buyer
Hey dad ,you seen the 12mm spanner anywhere? ,, best vid yet
He will not be able to buy anything off  the maker dealers. Was it worth it.. no. Do he care.. no.. because he got dropped on his head too many times as a kid.
Some people are starving.. Can't even go to school and this guys for pleasure break everything..
i think you wouldn't be able to buy a nother ferrari 🤣
Can you destroy the train?
Anyone see the Bentley in the background.... Next video I want that
That reverse entrance was nice
Wat a life boss man 😂😂😂💪💪💪👑👑🔥🔥
The real Forza Horizon Let's goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
I heard the rivian truck is out durability test this I'd love to see this one crumble
hate comment
Pure entertainment hahahahha
that was great
Honestly its probebly the most a Ferrari will ever be driven since people buy Ferrari's for a collectors item.
vediamo se il bro ha il coraggio di venire in italia
Yep, going up dem hills  in a ferrari to lose 4 stars like GTA
Fucking greatest ever 🙌
Lamborghini cover
Me playing gta online
No way it ended right there
Whistlin’ is the only channel where I come strictly for the comments. 😂😂
Dude, you forgot to throw the kitchen sink!
Dude playa forza in real life 😂
This man is nutz & I love it 😂 aye bro wassup send me a $1000 Honda
It's like driving cars in gta 5 in the mountains and what not🤣🤣🤘
That me in FH5
This is what inbreeding does to people. It’s a shame money is made by retards
Loved it! I live right down the road from where he grew up and this makes me proud in a weird way. Diesel, if you read this it would be  freaking amazing if this summer you just randomly showed up at the Bunker hill drag strip with this car ( if it survives), the Audi, and whatever else you can haul out there just to see what they do! 🤣 Keep it up!!!
Burn it baby🔥👌👌👌👌👌👌
Ferrari loves that bubble car part
man is playing forza in real life
dude  just played forza horizon irl
LMAO.......you threw everything BUT...........the Kitchen Sink!
Love ya bro!!! Salute
Guy can't even afford a new Ferrari but he's planning on spending 5 million on a fucking Bugatti? Ok bud 🙄
Ferrari doesn't make these pieces of art for some idiot to destroy on purpose. Rightfully they should deny your purchases
I smell an unnecessary lawsuit from ferrari Edit: Wrote this before started the video and its the first thing he mentions 😂
Where's the 5 million Dollar Bugatti?
POV: Me on the volcano in forza horizon 5
whistlinDiesel lambroghini next please
Take 2 wheels off and see how well the car could drive.
Here’s an idea for you. Take it to we buy any car.
😂
this most beutiful ad ever
*Ferrari has entered the chat
bro the cover says lamborini
Hey whistlin diesel just wanted to let you know that I have been a fan for years now and just wanted to let you know especially since you destroy a lot of good looking cars if you could get me your phone number and get me a truck because I really do need one and if you do ever see this I want one like the any level lift one in your video
👎 hmmmm that doesn't sound like you title for this video, 85% click bait
What a moron
Oddest thing I've seen white trash do on gods green earth..
Like a true wild horse that a Ferrari is. I love how he feeds it water in the end in case it’s thirsty after all that run.
Can I please get a shout out? I have a channel I’m just starting.
U should buy the new s650 mustang and destroy as a durability test
Wild
First word that comes to mind is Fuck Off! LOL
I strongly believe he has figured life out. Materials don’t matter so you might as well have fun with it
This whole video gave me anxiety 😅
12:16 Hahaha
Remember the episode where he said"this is the only car you'll ever see on this channel" good times
yeah, knowing how strict ferrari is, he is never getting another one. the video was worth getting banned from ferrari though lol
Ferrari model ?
For the way they doing whistlindiesel / Cody they will do every citizen in Smithville Tennessee
If I was whistlindiesel / Cody I would sue the city of Smithville Tennessee for a minimum of 100 million dollars
Forza players be like
If every citizen would sue the government or sheriff just idea of threatening them of violating the constitutional rights civil rights or otherwise get a hundred million dollars from these people and they would take their oath of office serious
For the exact same thing whistlindiesel / Cody is being accused of get 50 million I'm suing the city of Camden Tennessee for 10 million dollars for just the idea of threatening me with arrest of my constitutional right, they just threatened me and I'm wanting to sue for 10 million
People like whistlindiesel l and/Cody need to sue these people 50 million dollars ,I  go a  10 million dollar lawsuit pending against Camden Tennessee for violating my civil rights
his poor soul after destroying this.
Someone at Ferrari having a stroke eatching this
That last wrench definitely hit the car on the left.

This is my new goal in life
What’s the deal on the army uniform
Anyone got a timer going on the cease and desist letter from ferrari

"It's a safety feature" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Monster truck Ferrari
Bossfight established, taking bets now XD
.. Broooooooooo you make being wealthy look so exciting!!! Love this
Gta 5 POV:
ill build you a custom classic sailing yacht to see you destroy it. you wont.

This guy did in real life what I basically did every time I got an expensive car in GTA 5 hahaha
you should do a fighter jet next
Hey Whistlin diesel some buddy keeps texting me telling me i have won something can you please verify this in some sort of way im not going to TelIgRaM them intel  then

I don't know why, but the muffin tin at 13:43 got me good
bro is playing gta in real life
Dude that car cover bubble was insane 😱
At first I thought , what a dumb ass,  then I started watching it and my next thought was this is brilliant. Funny as hell and at the same time he is mocking  the pompous Ferrari manufacturer, love It!
https://youtube.com/shorts/-M8MoBaBt30?feature=share #whistlindiesel
*Cody has a HUGE forehead* !!!!!!!
in the world of cars we have ferrari, in the world of games we have nintendo.
I mean, if you’re finished with the Ferrari, I will gladly have fun with it some nice woods i mean roads here in Canada

For a minute there I’d say it would even pass as a commercial 😂😂
Hell of a tent commercial
9:40 me in Forza Horizon trying to get my car back to the festival
This is so good. Screw Ferrari. They're nothing without their customers.
Can u test the off road capibility of Subaru in full send mode please ?
This man is living in Forza horizon

Where is the next Ferrari video
This is one of these people that you should stay away from

Take it storm chasing, see what they do about that.
Prick. Knows the price of everything but the value of nothing.
Destroy a lawnmower next I would like to see that
I would give this dude my life saving and my car , for any of his beat up cars lol
me saving to buy my first car him destroying his super car casually
bro has irl money glitch
Meh I watch my 5 year old destroy shit all day so this content just ain't it
3:45 "Why don't we put little googly eyes on the horsey," - WhistlinDiesel
That’s crazy
next video you should buy a dealership and destroy everything in it.
That bubble is WhistlinDiesel™️ approved 😂😂
I was expecting him to completely ruin the car, but I'm sure that day will come shortly. It needs to be Grandiose.
Must be nice wasting your money on stupid things for clout. Adios 😂
I do exactly the same with Ferrari in Forza Horizon so it's legal... i think
Car is fine...mild thrashing.
Dude, your fu€k@n nut$! I love it. In some parralel universe I can see myself doing the same.
Everybody’s dream rally car
i bet they had a conveyer belt shooting that shit at it lol
Cody, would you like to sell that Ferrari? I have free space in the garage haha. So that you have an interesting episode with transport so many kilometers
Mocne! Pozdrowienia z Polski!
I have a video Idea. You should bring that Ferrari all beat up to Monterey car week and film the whole experience. That would be dope to film all the reactions. 😂
Best video of the decade.
ferrai deserves this for having weak roofs
I'm at 8:19 ...So far it's been pretty good advertising for Ferrari durability.
Looking forward to a new criminal trial series
i neeed this mans money..
how sick was that force field thing tho
dude is playing forza horizon lol
Ferrari been really quiet since this dropped
Once Ferrari see this video....Good luck trying to buy another one 🤣
This man is a treasure,  he needs to be protected at any cost.
I watched the ads if means anything to ya!!!!
My dude is doing Forza Horizon IRL
This is  crazy… Imagine if I had this car I could build my own house or just live in it
What would be the real knife twist in the back for Ferrari is after doing all of that you sold the thing $500 on the account that it “wasn’t all you thought it would be”…. And I would give $500 right now… 😊 cash, check, or Dogecoin
They’ll do anything for clout-Offset
Wow he ain’t a broke boy
Bro is playing gta irl
Watching him drive around off-road is reminding me so much of forza
There's a reason why I didn't get my notification for this particular video 🤣
13:15 that's crazy even for him.
12:23 it's crafty how people really have the nerve to make videos like that.
The fact that he risks his life by getting in trouble with the law just to entertain us makes him a total legend
Enzo is rollin in his grave rn😂
Famous last words: Give me a hammer!
...I'm italian and watching this for me represents... nothing.  So: 13:18
this is good
One men’s treasure is another man trash…
6:15 looks they they bury people vertically, standing up.
i was gonna cry if he actually destroyed it😮‍💨
soooo you're not destroying it
did anyone else hear the edited in gunfire when they were throwing crap at the bubble?
Achei q ta fofo ainda KKKKKKKKK
I feel the same way , its your car and you should be able to do with it as you please , if one car company could get away with stupid laws , the other will start to do the same thing
GTA5 IRL 😂
Lift kit
uh
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
When I paused the video to read done of the comments, one of them said,   "If we don't sue this charity no one will."  - Ferrari
When the test is over, give me the car, send it to the Dominican Republic
You're rich but stupid!
why always destroy things to make views... a shame...
Черт возьми на какой я канал наткнулся. Безбашенные ребята🔥👍
Ferraris not gonna sue there going to send you a massive check

I’ve waited so long for this

As far as im concerned... That specific car has its value increased the moment our boi got behind the wheel 😂

Me as a kid in Forza Horizon:
Bro this is literally just Forza

And this is why Ferrari dont sell assholes like you
He should be a rally driver cuz if he can control a Ferrari on mud imagine what he can do in a rally car
he's playing forza irl
This looks like something out of forza
Except you didn’t destroy it…
Cody might just reach Nirvana before anyone else.
Buy a ram trx bet u cant destroy it
Can't wait for the recall letter
If I were in the vehicle with this dude I wouldn't be able to stop laughing.
Tf
This  man called me poor in so many different ways i cba man
I still won't forgive you for the Hilux 😭
Hey Jackass- Crash it trying to turn a fast lap at a racetrack. Being a total douche mistreating a highly desired piece of world class art is a behavior displayed by complete infantiles. Don’t like people hating on you get off the web and contribute to society in a positive manner. I pray that you are a seedless cucumber so there will never be another one of you.
that’s what you call f u money
Now Ferrari has to make a Off Road Supercar and be the first to do it
I want the car
You should have donate that money.
this shits actually extremely funny
bro STILL has the hilux
Forza irl
How to tell someone you got fu money without saying it
Remember the *TaxTheRich100* YouTube channel?
Reading the title and watching. I was wondering why? Then I saw how many Subs he has. Then it made sense. The views will pay for any damage.
best video ever 😂😂
Make it offroad👀👀
This is Enzo Ferraris eternal hell loop
This one will be your last car to purchase from Ferrari 😂😂
Ferrari has to hire him as a test driver. the man can drive
I would like to buy the scraps for 1$ lol that would be sick if you can drop it off at my house 😂
Ferrari sues 2h later
What a dumb utube video.
He definitely planned on crashing it but fell in love with it low key 😂
shameful , stupid and made by a piscopal child

One of the best YouTube videos I’ve seen so far. 🤝
stupid human
Pov: Forza horizon irl
5:55 general Kiko moment
Ferrari needs an understanding of how a legitimate business works. All that money and no brains. Once you sell a product, it not longer has anything to do with you nor your company. It is no longer your product. It belongs to me now and I will do anything and everything to it or with it, that I want. Absolutely nothing they can do about it. A cease and desist means absolutely nothing.
Partiamo con un....sei da black list a Maranello. Passando per un... avevo letto che sei un coglione,e...lo confermiamo a doppia spunta. Finiamo con un...visto che hai 400000 $ da spendere in queste stronzate...fai un piacere all'umanità,fai della beneficenza... Cajoun!!!!!

Bro is living the dream 😂
Just stupid. Nothing else to say.

It shouldn't matter what you do to or with your car once you own it. CALM DOWN FERRARI!!!
Hmmm....a YT channel featuring assholes for the entertainment of assholes ( I can only assume). Bye
🇩🇴
That one rich Karen sending this vid to Ferrari
I ended watching this the fourth time. Thanks YouTube recommendations
I wish these videos were longer

This guy is laughing all the way to the bank...
Tavarish is ready to buy and restore it
PLEASE DO A TESLA TEST, I LOVE THOSE CARS
Hey you should go back into the cave
Mettere una Ferrari sotto il telo Lamborghini e già grave di suo…..
Big meaty tyres and a small lift👀👀👀
Although I don’t hold it against you AT ALL, it hurts a little when I drive my son around in a jeep that barely works and you’re out here smashing nice cars lol.
What comes after 13:16 is the best part ! NGL I want a Ferrari now that I can see how much it can handle ripping on dirt trails, lmao
Bros playing gta5
Finally, it’s safe to say I can now go ahead and purchase a Ferrari
that was salmon not cod lol
This man's legal team is sweating right now
Sounds like you wanna get sued for the publicity
Not buy another, put a lift kit and offroad wheels, and let's see real power
i thought that was a cheese stick at the end some sharp cheddar wouldve gotten thru it
“Ferrari has set a $150 million bounty on you.”
Love how you have sandbox level money
lets put destroying a Ferrari away and focus on Cody's amazing driving skills
You should do a draw and give away wrecked cars
Should definitely join the local Ferrari club for cars & coffee to swap some driving stories.
hello. no one translates your channel into Russian? the translator who translated a year ago does not catch mice at all
you're the mad scientist who does it up big every time!
Best Ferrari content of all time 🏎️🔥🔥

Cease and desist coming straight at ya

Playing forza horizon in real life
So, I just gotta say, before I got disabled, I worked for the biggest used Mercedes parts places in the USA.  The biz model was: buy fancy cars that are damaged, and part them out on the internet.  So we got fancy cars in all the time, and typically they would be drivable, but would have some minor cosmetic damage, that "totalled" them, not in real life, but just in the imaginary world of automotive comprehensive insurance.  Boss had 5+ acres in a toxic waste part of town, and was a good sport about our shenanigans, as long as we worked hard, helped her out of a jam when she had rush orders, that kind of thing.  Basically as long as we were good employees, we could get a little dukes of Hazzard when we wanted.  All that is just to give my credentials when I say that your videos cause me physical pain, but it's like going to therapy or something.  I grew up poor, I started buying my own food and clothing around age 10, and got my first legit job paying taxes and all that at 13, in my country you need a special permit to work at 14, the feds really dropped the ball on protecting me, hah.  My parents made okay money, but had some major mental health issues, so I was raised kinda feral.  I sorta rebelled against my crazy parents by being super financially responsible, instead of normal kids rebelling against their responsible parents by being whacky.  So even though I'm 40, I've got this like deeply deeply engrained need to not damage expensive things, or allow others to damage them through inaction.  So yes, thank you for the free therapy from destroying expensive things, I'm too cheap, because of my childhood trauma, to spring for the real thing, which I so desperately need, lol.
Gently used and meticulously cared for, 1 owner and all easy highway miles. Amazing condition no lowballs I know what I got
But why?
yaknow what man, i would kill for that car, but this guy is making memories and i respect it. I was smiling and cringing the entire time
Bro made gta real
this is how ferrari should test their cars from now on
Ferrari : imagine being us
bro is gonna get sued
El vídeo es cojonudo hahaha
I need a car to go to College😢. Can please help me get a car ?❤
That poor Ferrari
This video was gas
That hood has some serious porta-potty possibilities!
Knew he didn’t have the balls to destroy that Ferrari 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
please tell the world how stupid you are ...?
dude is breaking so many cars and i cant afford a 3000$ car
You are the dumbest person to be on YouTube you destroy high end cars and you don't need to have them
Some people don’t even have money to eat, and this guy is destroying a Ferrari
When the most interesting man in world, says Hold my beer!
Ferrari sucks they think Thier cars are special stuck up morons
Cant find my 9mm socket guys
Mexico 🇲🇽 & United Arab Emirates 🇦🇪 have the best American trucks in the WORLD
Best hobby😂
He needs to buy a Ariel atom and test the durability
Wht ferrari is this
He gone be banned by ferrari from purchasing more ferrari’s 😶‍🌫️
Don't think your gonna be put on ferraris customer list any time soon.
The world has real problems. Conspicuous consumption and destroying the hard work of others is a terrible look. Next time you hear of supply chain issues or inflation think of how much it took to bring this car into existence only to destroy it for "fun". But I guess it is OK if it brings income. Let's not mistake income for success.
I will give you $5 for what's left🤣..
the amount of pain... the pain is excruciating. WHY GOD WHY NO NOT THE FERRARI
You are f***ing psychopath
Imagine buying something for your own benefit or for whatever you want it for at that matter an all these people got stuff to say like you don't like it then make the money this guy makes an put your "Ferrari " in your garage but our boy here is finna destroy it but you wanna know what it's HIS
This is such a full circle video. Congrats on your success Cody
Something Jerry would do if he was reviewing cars
Moron
Makes me want one. I’d be happy if I were Ferrari
This video hurts different and all parts of my soul
This Ferrari ends up in Facebook Marketplace as mint condition, low mileage, less than 30 days old for $350,000
Whistling diesels channel is just a compilation of my intrusive thoughts taking over!!!
The edit on time stamp 8:40-8:49👌NAILED IT😂😂
Great video
no kitchen sink? you're  slipping whistlin
shit where u get all those things to trow at that car so , dam
this man needs to be stopped
Guy at 4:42 ish looks like hitler😂
Pojęcia nie macie o katowaniu aut xD, motokoty muszą was podszkolić
Ferrari rn: 🫣🫣😱😱😱😱😱
The outro is hilarious and impressive at the same time.
No way he dosen’t get sued😂
Here's us struggling to live week by week and your trying to rek a 440k car
Ferrari HQ is hiring some mafia right now lmao
Give me that red car I will give 2 g wagon AMG g63

Bro played Forza irl💀
Couldn't you have bought an old Toyota Supra to do that in.  Somebody please stop him!!!
400,000 dollar unforgettable memories 😂
Watching this hurts a lot less than destroying the Hilux
He is best ,if he doesn't get sued by ferrari it will be supriseing , , he is a G doesn't care
What worse… Ferrari or that b*tch who owns the rights to Elenor…
The company with the bubble protection should sponsor you cuz you just made a really good promotion vid 😂
bro’s plainrock124 at the next level 💀
Ferrari black list speedrun:
You should make it into a death kart
WHY?! AHAHAH
Lamborghini cover better then ferrari car 🔥❤️💪😂
The way to get yourself banned from Ferrari like Justin bieber
He is living my dream all those intrusive thoughts but couldn't afford he does em. My wife is looking at me cause I'm giggling like a little kid. Love all the videos
I don't get it. It's your car. They can't tell you what you can't do with your own property.
They banned you for life because of the Ferrari thing? It's just that Ferrari has this tendency to ban people from doing things with their Ferraris.
my guy Is playing forza horizon 5 in real life
Not very classy.
Been waiting a long time for one of these videos
And lawsuit from Ferrari coming
At the end I'd hate to be the one having to clean all that up lol
I wished he would hv shot it with a Rambo bow and arrow
Some JW pioneer couple could’ve used that for pioneering …omg.  So disappointing 🤣
Quietin down I'm trying to see where I'm going that reminds me of my dad when I was young he'd slap us in the face then turns down the radio and says be quiet I'm trying to see were I'm going
Me watchin wonderin whats in all those boxes👀
Bro…. ADOPT ME..!!!!!!!😂😂😂😂
If the good die young that's his song lol
Tbh I hate cars but that thing is sick lookiing lol
ARE YOU 11- X OR 11-B IF NOT TAKE OFF OUR UNIFORM YA NO PATCH SO IT'S LEGAL BS KEEP IT UP SOMEONE WILL COME TALK TO YOU
Folks give him flack on buying expensive vehicles and destroying it they say things like wat a waste of money lol well its his money he can buy wat he wants to with it and further more he can do with it what he wants too and he makes the money back ten fold by you haters watching his vids lmao it's a win win because he has fun he makes good money and well we all get to watch it all unfold 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️😁😁😁😁 I luv it...
13:53 aww man.. totally missed opportunity to actually throw a kitchen sink at it...
Can i get a ferarri plez😂
You hear that? That's Ferrari's legal team running towards you bro.   seriously cool ass way to enjoy a supercar.
They should take u in fast and furious 10 . LMAO..
This is cringe and unnecessary video. Buy it,  sell it for charity, that will help much more than just distroy a car or should i say burning 400k.
Cool
Hands down one of the funniest videos I’ve seen in a while
I'm actually pretty impressed with the car.  I never thought it would make it through everything you put it through and still come out lo I like Ferrari as well as others but this is seriously one of the coolest videos.  Off-roading a Ferrari like that has probably never been done.  Smashy smashy! :)
I just realized that Ferrari's policy isn't stupid - it's really against stupid people...
I absolutely love this and we need to teach Ferrari to fuck off and it's our damn car not yours
Ferrari is trash go for a Lamborghini they last longer and they’re easier to maintain  It’s just a hyped up brand-name flick wearing a Gucci T-shirt  It says I’m stupid and I wanna spend a bunch of money on a car that’s not gonna last that long  Lamborghini Huracan all day over Ferrari
rebuild my crown vic for me 😢😂 id love a tranny that doesnt slip and maybe a 5.0 🙏🏻
After destroyingg it why don’t you give it to tavarish for rebuilding
Ferrari is gonna sue you 💀💀
Слава Україні
Best advert for a car bubble ever
This guy is insane 😳 👏
farreri?
U didn't throw the kitchen sink at it 🤷‍♂️
I like how at the start it has a Lamborghini cover on it

You are so broke You can’t even post a video every day similar to this  one 😔
I don't like this guy
@WHISTLinDiesel   Dude if Andrew Tate's Buugaattii goes to auction u should get it and well do your thing
people do forget that it's just a car. expensive but still a car.. so have fun
Poor  Ferrari
This is way better than storing these art pieces in a garage for 100 years
Bitch ass dude ain't even good at breaking shit
Your a pussy destroy the motherfucker like all the other shit
Give me a John Deere 6120 PLS
Deserves a special spot in hell
I would literally burn down a child hospital for a 100 bucks and dudes be buying these crazy priced cars just to destroy them
But why
I DARE YOU TO DESTROY IT!!!
That was painful to watch... Can you ship the engine to me in the UK, it screams to go in my rusty TJ 🤪
This Ferrari Video was hilarious, especially when whoever was throwing everything but the Kitchen Sink at that Enormous Bubble the Ferrari was inside, this item can take a beating. The Ferrari too, most owners wouldn't dare to this to their vehicles especially a Ferrari.
I absolutely hate this.  With that said.... this is pure gold!🤣🤣 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
This is gta ?😂😂
Fuck Ferrari
you forgot the anvil at the end
you mean we made youtube pay you 400k+ for you to destroy it
pov me in gta
When are we doing a Koenigsegg ?

Whistlindiesel : https://youtu.be/7d2moH6jWh8 Ferrari: Would you like THE position with our advertising department Mr. Whistlindiesel?
Some of the best Ferrari content ever maximising what that car is really made of
Did nobody else notice that it was under a Huracan cover? Lol
Imagine if someone tags ferrari
I like Ferrari as well as others but this is seriously one of the coolest videos.  Off-roading a Ferrari like that has probably never been done.  Smashy smashy! :)
How about Rolls Royce next time🤔🤔🤔

I was hoping you would run the car over  with the excavator.
This dude is a menace to society
YOU are a piece of excrement dude. (I would use SHIT but, you tube gets mad). People work hard all of their lives- some just to survive. Others to feed their families, make a difference in the world or just pay ALOT for living. You LUCKED OUT (because talent? You don't have. At all) and have a successful you tube channel with equal minded anuses as your audience. So, you make money. Alot of money. So, instead of HELPING humanity or Blessing others, what do you do? Buy expensive things just to destroy. For views. What a DICK. Karma will eventually catch up dude. And I will RELISH the moment. I wouldn't piss on you if you were on fire.
@ferrari prendiamo provvedimenti
Io che da italiano vedo una opera d’arte maltrattata
Totally destroyed

Stupid boy

My petrolhead hart bleeds by seeing all this unnecessary destroying of such a fine piece of machinery.

Possibly the stupidest video ever uploaded to YouTube. We are all infinitely dumber for having been subjected to this completely pointless nonsense. Why YT recommended this video to me is just further proof that AI is deeply flawed.

How to get banned by Ferrari in 15 Minutes.
Not only did Ferrari sue its customers, they a charity as well, for supposedly, not promoting the car enough....what part of a none profit  charity they didn't get.  Thanks for the Rally footage, and Enzo Ferrari would have been disappointed with what the company is doing to it's customers.  👦👍🏎🏁🏁🚩I could only afford a 2022 Roush Mustang with the 3rd Pedal 6 Speed Manual Transmission  👦👍🏎🏁🚩 would prefer a more outrageous Lamborghini... though would never buy anything without a 3rd Manual Transmission.  Great footage the Buubble does work well .
This is so unnecessary 🫣
poor car
this man is doing gods work
Again that money could have been used to save dineibes life who may not have lived because no one was there to help. Utterly and grossly disgusting 🤮 dude. Go and help someone please with all that wasted money. Sad 😢
The lawsuit started when the lambo cover was on the Ferrari 😂
Keeps his Lambo nice and trashes his Ferrari. I love you dude
Too much bs I this video
Rich ,uncharitable assholes like this are the decline of America’s selfish youth
When they threw the crutch at 13:28 I lost it lmao
Next test: hit it with a RPG
Why?
Americans always wasting things, food and everything just for fun. What sick people do this.

I want to download this video 😂
I don’t think Ferrari would have a problem with a durability test, it would only prove how tough they are built😅 …or not?🤷🏻‍♂️
wait a minute… if crashing ur car is not what ur supposed to do with it, specifically a Ferrari, then cant you get sued for crashing a Ferrari?
another big ol' "fuck you" to shitty motor vehicle conglomerates worldwide. i'm proud of you bud! :)

Ngl I don’t like super cars but god damn after the tube it sounded nasty 😮‍💨
This was painful to watch.

Hey man you might want to be careful - if you didn't know Ferrari takes their cars very serious and have sued people before over minor things.
why are you so reserved?🤔
Wastful
Lift it and put wheels
What’d he say at 3:14?
This is funny but hurts
Halo Polska jesteście tu? Hahahha

Forza horizon 5 irl
Pierdolony GÓWNIARZ,który nie docenia pieniędzy!oby się stało tak żeby kiedyś brakowało mu na CHLEB
The camera man:🤦‍♂️😳🫥☹️😭💀
the company who makes that bubble should use this video as advertisement
He’s going to hell all jokes aside. This dude is the ultimate definition of a POS, and a waste of space. This dude literally doesn’t deserve a single item he owns, not because he didn’t work for it but because he destroys it. He needs to get punched
What in the Ferrari. Need a job like this.
I hate this dude
Watching this before this gone actually gunna screen record this beauty 🤣
I’m new to channel and great video
Cody: “Give me a hammer”  Man: “throws everything in sight” 😂😂
If I had a pennie for every time some one bought a ferriari just to destroy it I would have enough to buy my own Ferrari. 🤦‍♂️
Forza Horizon players when they have nothing to do
shout out to the editors!
this dude is so punchable with his all black outfit and backwards hat... lmao whatta goof
Do a colab with Elon musk and launch it to space with your logo on it it just to flex.
What a prize IDIOT !
caption should b broke dude in the middle of nowhere buys used ferraris to destory them
i bought two lambo just to destroy it and drove it like that
This hurts to watch, I could never afford the tires much less the car
I am the target audience.
Ferrari should literally sit down and watch what an amazing car they’ve built that literally climbs wet and muddy 20% slope hills on only two wheel drive and smashes into gates without a single scratch, not sue you. This man is literally advertising Ferrari with his own earned money to the world. So for the haters: 🤌🏻🤌🏻🤌🏻
Now just gotta build a killdozer for when the Ferrari lawyers come.
I love how uncomfortable this video made me feel, keep it up! lmao
Enzo Ferrari wanted it this way
What the heck is wrong with this guy?
I'm not mad, I'm jealous
Didn’t even destroy it
How big is their property lol
Destroy MonsterMax....
White ppl are so retarded
douche bags
Dam u got nothing else better to do with money right dam u must be really bored
Its like gta
Can I have your car?
This hurts to watch
I would really like/ love to join in the fun of bull dozing this Ferrari
I can't watch this...
Not gonna lie.. THATS THE  BEUTIFULEST SOUND IVE EVER HEARD IN A FERRARI
🙄🤣👍🏻
Shame
That whole thing at 13:19 is basically what it looks like when I'm looking for a 10mm socket 3 hours into a 20 minute project, but if there was a Ferrari in a bubble nearby.
POV play a forza horizon in real life
This is just Forza horizon
🫣… Me like….Me want
So can he not destroy it because he will get sued? That’s ridiculous
What’s the boxes in the back?
There’s just something so beautiful about seeing a Ferrari drifting on a gravel road
Man Cody you are the man!!! Come up to ALASKA and rally with us and stay at our mansion!!! Let’s see what Ferrari has to say about this video! 🤣
Forza Horizon 3 RTX Enabled
average Forza Horizen experience
Hands down the best Ferrari video I’ve ever seen. Also, a legendary testimony to that car balloon 😂
I new what I was doing when I clicked the video but it hurts more then I imagined
Honestly I’m wicked impressed with the balloon or bubble whatever you wanna call it occurs a piece of junk who cares put it in the chipper
That’s a lawsuit
Enzo se está acuchillando en su tumba
I like how whistleindiesel proved all the haters wrong and got a 400 k Ferrari

Me in Forza
Ngl I was sweating at the end..
Cool video, the same with a McLaren or a koenigsegg
pov: you have too much money
Newspaper Too Newspaper. Supercars are expensive luxury goods, but the car can't stand it. it's best to treat the supercar as a friend
cody vs ferrari - round one. FIGHT!
It hurted me more than my breakup
Something I just wish u will give this cars away for free or resell it😒😒
I love your videos
Doug demuro Collab when 😂
So sad, I would of taken it....  And done that 😆  No but seriously can I have it

This made me cringe so hard 😂
this is killing me
Nice video

I don't think k he's funny he's a spoilt kid of utube payments he's probably never done a day's work
I don’t think my cheecks have hurt this much after a video 😂
@gnarpm did it first with a McLaren
Spread The Gospel
God is good Jesus is good God bless you all Amen
How many misery in the world we could’ve solved with all this money
I didn't know whether to laugh or cry, to be honest. It's always awesome to poke fun at Enzo, the notorious asshole, and his extreme arrogance, and the corporate culture he created, but isn't it another to destroy something so beautiful, that so many people took so much pride in building? Driving it hard is one thing, but driving it through a steel gate for Youtube views is tasteless. That car costs more than most people see in a lifetime. If you don't like the Ferrari brand, pull a Ferruccio.
12:17
Dude you're fucking hilarious
Fuck a duck! This shit is for fucking real! If I could be anyone in the world, it would be Whistlin diesel motherfucker!
gta irl fr
this is the classic person born with a lot of luck, from a family full of money, and uses the pope's money as the fuck he likes without giving value to the things he buys, if I had a Ferrari, as an Italian I am, I would marry it
GOD DAMN IT NOT THE TRIBUTO
Damn that's mind blowing! Even i don't treat my Ferrari this bad in forza lol
Help people Man don't destroy the money

i would rather see this then see a car that sits in a house and is never driven.
Bros driving like its forza
Your videos keep getting better and better
he just ran the greatest ad ever…
Someone needs to explain to me how when you purchase a car the manufacture has any say at all in what you do with it
Spending $400.000 just to get some likes on youtube? Show's your level of intelligence...HEY, I got money!!! Watch me destroy expensive cars....fuckin dumbass, You could feed a small town with that kind of cash, but...apparently, your ego is more important. I WANT TO BEEN SEEN AND ADMIRED FOR MY STUPIDITY!!!
It is accually pretty impressive as to how it took zero damage from this vidio. This makes me want to see it dead even more
This is so Amazing 🥰
Damn, He threw everything but the kitchen sink
History with red vehicles such as FIRETRUCKS Edit: and the amount of cars he has in the background
I want to try it To have enough money to do something like this It's my dream too.

I can’t watch the ridiculousness
Ferrari: His social media audience is larger than ours what do we do?  WhistlinDiesel: Ha try us!!! 🤣

I’d be more impressed if you destroyed the General! 👍👍👍👍👍
bros playing with my dads lifes saving fr
Bro why💀
I home Ferrari sees this video and he shits his pants.
you should do a video of destroying a megaraptor f250
I see what you did there, and I don’t mean going viral for destroying expensive stuff. You are a smart kid! Keep it up!
This is what I would do to a Ukrainian bimbo.
Kinda funny I guess
He is dead by Ferrari  They be like ahh hell na man that is our car  Kill him by making him pay for our bills
A lot of italian people will bring you to jail
Soooo.... when u gona destroy it?
This man playing with fire 😂
Yo lmaoo
Enzo just shit his pants in his coffin.
I really loved what you did there. I actually think Ferrari will not care.  Especially after seeing what you did to that guy who robed you.
WhistlinDiesel is the 🐐 fr.
Dude just plays forza horizon irl XD. Anyone knows if he's still alive or sth? #Ferrarisucks
Hey farari the car is completely safe
He is never going to be able to buy exotic cars again 😂😂 this is my first time seeing one of these doing anything besides be a valet car so I’m excited to see more
4.7 million views hahaha he can buy another.
Talk about one hell of an advertisement for that bubble deal. The company at least needs to cover him  when he get sued by Ferrari
Asphalt 9 be like:
how to basic but more expensive XD
Well let watch while knowing people sleep with out any food.....that money could have do something better

Lemme have it after your done😂
Wow.  That Chinese spy balloon is top notch at protecting a car.
Gratulálok,  Te egy igazi seggfej vagy!!!
Love this video 😂
A Ferrari is just an expensive Chrysler
That’s a bad ass ad at the end them throwing a bunch of shit lmao
Thats great advertisement for that plastic bubble thing. About the only thing that held up out of this entire video
This is the actual proof that YouTube pays their content creators too much for their own good.. but it sure does make for good content
WWWWHHHHHHYYYYYY
What video game is this looks very fun and realistic.
Bro is playing GTA
bro i literally thought lawsuits😹😹
The car is in the king of dubai car lock up. There is no way he will give it up. His son has already made a video saying he's got it safe for him.
Your a G
dumb ass
Pure entertainment he never disappoints keep whistlen man go get em
😬
that car bubble just got the best ad they could've asked for unintentionally i honestly was impressed
11:08 “look how clean it’s getting” I lost my shit 😂
this is sooooooo coooooool
This hurt my soul
i was expectin the last thing to throw on the ferrari its a bullet
Cody destroying a Ferrari: My goals are beyond your understanding
Petition for WhistlinDiesel to destroy a Kia soul.
How about doing something positive with $400K like feeding homeless veterans or children in need of medical care funds! One day you will be sent for, and come before the Big Boss face to face. Then its too late pal.
He straight bullied the Ferrari
These americans  in the comments have never been off road and it shows. Cars with high power always go well off road i bet that car would drive on a beach
This was awesome 🤤🤤🤤
Americans surprised by a supercar offroad this is a normal day in australia
you should get a proper job
The Supra in the background
Marketing at it best
thats stupid help people with that money stop doing things like that
me in gta be like:
Love you man
fucking skurvbeny kokot liberlaksy
Ferraris aren't that bad after all.
Ferrari is not a luxury car brand, is an F1 team thet sells sports car to finance it
Umm. I can use a car lol
What the fuck is wrong with that guy and hitting all that shit in that car? Put a fuckin blade on the front and level your own track as you go! Sheesh .. everyone knows that,,,Sheesh.
I wana see this video next week “You won’t believe how much Ferrari sued me for ”
Eventough I love the humour towards ferrari, this hurts soo much to watch😂
Now playing Forza Horizon 5 doesn't feel so bad!
Ferrari sue this man until he has no organs left 🤬
GTA has taught this man well
Fozra horizon

I will say I love destroying stuff that has no meaning to me but a Ferrari I wouldn’t have the guts
Low GTA 6 🤔😱

The amount of anxiety I had while watching this is crazy 🤣
I use to get mad with this guy videos destroying things, but but!!!  We live just once and he is living and enjoying it at its best..so here iam 🤣🤣🤣
Hungry kids in Cambodia could have ate that ferrari
It's a shame that people like you have so much money. You have to watch out for such cars, you just can't drive them in the dirt!!  If you didn't even have enough money for an apartment and had to save for every cheap thing you want to buy you wouldn't throw money around like that.
5 days 5 million views ..... He may know something ....
ill happily buy that ferrari for 2k
Forza Horizon 5 in real life

Bro that sounded INSAIN
Subscribe for a chance to win a brand new Iphone
This what you call content😂
Not gonna lie, I'd love to see you get another Ferrari and attempt to enter a legit rally race.  It held its own pretty well. I feel like the right tires, suspension and....thoughtful deletes would make you a serious threat.
bro playing gta online
impressvie i could tell you all was not holding back at all the amout of heavy stuff trowed towards the car wow that would damage any normal car so that covering works amazing
What a dumbass
He is the definition of money wil come and go but the memories will be eternal

Imagine when he can’t destroy a sky scraper.
Hello Brazil🇧🇷
Hahaha and I only want 30k to buy an S7 😂😂😂this guy is nuts!!! Lol
Please turn one into a rally car
If the manufacturer of that bubble doesn't use that last 60 seconds uncut and unaltered for a commercial,  they are missing out. That could pay for the car on it's own.
Now u can safe money by using cease and desist letters instead of toilet paper
This is what I'd do if I had the money to buy a beater Mondial or 348, except I'd make it a rally car.
Predicting a Bugatti reveal next summer
Have fun sweet pumpkin.
Can I have the it now ??
Does anyone know what hes making up words in his head
dude just give the  car to me if u dont  want to have it
click bait
@ferrari
I actually appreciate you doing this to a Ferrari...showing how durable they really are,...or aren't....hahahahahhahaa THANK YOU
Let's be honest most of his viewers are between 8 and 16 years old And they watch his videos multiple times in a row I have never met somebody older than 21 years old that likes or watches his garbage And just watch when he tries to do other things and people tell him his audience is just a bunch of kids His channel will never be able to grow because he'll lose most of his audience if he doesn't buy stuff and destroy it which is extremely simple and childish
Can anyone tell me what those army containers are for in the background?
Aw i though he was going to destroy it
IRL Forza🤣
Legend. Always a big FU to the haters

U gona be in a legal trouble for raping a Ferrari
Já já a Ferrari solta uma nota repudiando a atitude desse cara e proibindo o consumo da marca pra ele, vai vendo
I think it's super stupid just to go out there and pay $400,000 for a vehicle and destroy it you might as well just make a video of you burning $400,000 make totally no sense at all and like I have always said it takes a smart businessman to be successful and to start a business but anybody can inherit money if you give a poor bum a million dollars they will be rich then but when people inherit something and or whatever the case is because eventually you're going to end up going broke destroying all of these vehicles which personally I don't care about the vehicles honestly it's just stupid to go out there and spend that much money on something and destroy it you're wasting your money why don't you instead why don't you go find a truck that's worth 100,000 fixed up and go pay 10 grand for it and fix it up and sell it at auction actually make money
WD has become the new Tax the Rich
My bro real play Forza Horizon 5 😂
Dude it really hurts 💔🥺
do a Koeningsegg durability test
Let me get a hellcat
ferrari rally car that is so cool goodjob, and rest in piece after ferrari sends their assassins.
Your the man your videos are the best
Can you let us know what Ferrari says lo
Let's be honest if he really had balls he would do it to an F1 but he bought a CHEAP Ferrari!
Should’ve had demolition ranch shoot the door with his 50cal
Nobody is thinking 10 or 20 years from now when they look back at how he got started he's going to be ashamed of all this literally
Dude stop lying for the internet you're not going to do anything to that car that would piss Ferrari off you just going to make it look like you would for content
I think it's funny that nobody cares anymore that he's buying expensive stuff and destroying it because it got old really quick and these videos aren't even coming close to the old ones
Vhat is the supra bisaid you in 4:15 minute
This is a whole mother lord level of legal games your trying to play here
This guy is playing Forza horizon in real life
Man this is the best advertisement that car bubble thing could have ever gotten
omg you cracker jack 🤣🤣🤣
How can you just waste money like that ? I cant even afford to fix the transfer case in my truck which is now stuck in my driveway ....if you wanna waste money then waste some my way..... i could use some help as a disabled vet.
you need a cool rally car
Guaranteed someone punches a hole in there wall with this video and I haven’t even watched it yet 😂😂😂
Threw everything but the kitchen sink at the red stallion!
Monsterarri
good thing rednecks aren't rich
The Yamaha banshee of sports cars. Very cool 😎

Fuck doug demuro this is a real car review
actualy, big red just might this as marketing, lmaoooooo le mans is just around the corner
Forza horizon in Real life xD
Looks like my GTA character
Good job
If only a few more Ferari Owners would watch this video we could Break the 5 Million mark !
Honestly this could probably be a commercial
This dudes bank account 😭😭😭😭
bro didn't even destroy it
So did they sue??? We need to know!!!!
ridiculous
👍
I f'ing love it.
nice eyes bro
GTA in real life
The gunshot sounds at the end 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

The endingg was madd
nice episode sea the next car will bend BMW
Proper way to drive a Ferrari!
I thought gta logic was made up but you proved me wrong today sir
What I would give to just be there
What an idiot
Love the Lambo cover.
Ferrari is punching the air right now.
Why you ask so stupid? ????😢😢😢😢
my kids thought the bubble was cooler then the car
I still hate this ass hole he never disappoints. There's people starving and this piece of shit still going.
I'll buy this car for $1 if you wanna sell it :)
This is one of the best Supercar commercials i have ever seen🫶🤝👏🙌👐🤲👍👎👊✊🤛🤟🫰✌️🤞🤜🤘👌🤌🤏🫳👇👆👉👈🫴☝️✋🤚🖐🖖💪🫱🫲🤙👋🖕✍️🙏🫵🦵🦶
When is part 2 coming?
Meanwhile Lamborghini wouldn’t give a second glance at any redneck modifications made to one of their cars; self tap a big gulp cup holder into it👍🏻 take both doors off of it, do whatever you want to it. All of that makes Lamborghini superior. I don’t have a brain for performance stats gentlemen, but I have an idea 🤣 on a more less than stupid and serious point, all those crashed Enzo’s look far worse for Ferraris representation than making a 458 look like Pikachu.
nice forza horizon gameplay!
Bros living In GTA irl
If I ever hit the lottery I would not tell anyone but there would be signs 😂😂😂😂
its like a comedy show to me and most probably i thought after ending of video he will destroy this Ferrari but it didn't happen.....i love watching his videos make my body stress free......love you
I dont do that not even in Forza horizon
Forza Horizon real life
this is litterally my dream car....
Dude I got this, do a bow testing video about how many expensive ones you can destroy before you start pissing off hunters who hunt with great grand dads long bow lmao I'll post this a thousand times.til you notice it
I’m more impressed with the fact that they threw that much shit at the bubble and it didn’t pop
this is my dream car and you destroy it well done bro
Get off Moparzillas nuts. He already started this same shit. Your ideas are redundant and played out. Ohh lemme buy something expensive and trash it. Your inbred, played out antics are just lame. All your fan boys are 12, but your probably like that. Same reason your wife is getting pile driven by someone with an actual brain nowadays.
This was funny the bubble part was hard 😂
For a moment, I expected him to throw a kitchen sink onto the car protective bubble.
this guy does the best of things to cars
"Man u cant drive ferrari off road" show them this video
Ammo NYC : "Today we've got a Ferrari F8..."
Best part! " We're doing donuts in a freakin ferrari" Love it!
U should give me the Ferrari so i can video it being beat on the right way
He's driving off-road in a Ferrari like I do ....when I play GTA 🤫
vergognati
if ferrari trys to control what you do with YOUR vehicle they are a shit company
Forza Horizon irl
12:12 that made me laugh💀

Pov me in forza when bored
Bro 😂playin gta irl
why did you just waste $400'000 dollars
I love the internet
Why would Ferrari sue for this? This is the best durability advertisement in history. 😂
Clickbait, didn't destroy it, didn't even scratch it, just drove it through a bunch of dirt
Rofl at wiz funny. Fire us over a hundred grand if unsure what to do with it 😉
The end segment is worth more than the car.
Paint it with anime stickers
At first I thought you are an idiot. But when watched this a bit further I realized you are an idiot. How the world is a better place with you doing what you are doing.
Damn……I was waiting for the kitchen sink…….🤷🏼‍♂️
This is the first video I have ever watched that I did not skip the ads. Comment for the algorithm
I need the second part of destroying this ferrari..
The end was amazing
Change Ferrari into a drift car!
I'm impressed how well it held up, but not impressed you didn't jump it or something more extreme
this what i be doing in forza horizon lmao
I understand when it's a crappy ford ranger but I think it's a bit far with a ferrari
Biden spends that much shooting down party balloons.
🔥
only 3.000 miles! Minor scratches but like brand new! Ready to dominate the streets!
next morning he didnt wake up beacuse ferrari shot him
Epic!
Off road rarri, don't forget the big lights
Enzo Ferrari in the comments like 👁 👻 👁
I'm more impressed that someone manage to throw a ladder right over the car
Buy a upgraded Suron and destroy it??
Fuk Yeah !
I’ve lived in Nashville my entire life and seeing all your videos since you moved I know where all of them take place love the videos and the new meaning of smashville you’ve brought to the place
This was awesome! Really impressed with that bubble thing. Lmao
*receives a letter from Ferrari the next day*
Yo, buy a mitsubishi lancer evo V and make a durability test. I'm pretty sure you're gonna like that thing.
Who.                     Asked.
Anyone else fear what’s coming when the tank finally arrives💀
This is Ferrari, our legal team has made several attempts to contact you. -Furarry
We need him to destroy a Supra😂all the jdm fanboys would lose it 🤣
Buy an lbz like old times
8:20 Literally me for 6 hours straight playing GTA V 🗿

That car cover brand is going to make a lot of money off this vidso

Looks like you didn’t make your money back
Puta que te pariu hein bicho louco

@WhistlinDiesel can you bring back the Jean jacket!
Good advertisement lol i never wanted Ferrari before this. Shit sound good asf lol
true point he should go be a tester at koeningsegg:)))
Bro this is so messed up you could have given that car to poor people or something😢😢
Send your video to Ferrari congratulating them on making such a fine handling car.
Can I have that?
It has to suck to be your cleanup crew 😂
My First word Rip
You is a criminal
Aww man. Such a beautiful car. Wish I had one
Porsche gt2rs bekliyorum sende 😀
What if Ferrari turned this into a rally car all cause of this?
Who knew there was demand for videos of people wrecking very expensive things. Kind of weird but apparently people dig it.
Bro real life playing forza
Ferrari should pay you! For durability marketing 💪
Feels like I'm watching Forza Horizon 4 gameplay.
lemme buy an army box doe
You could just give it to me
This heartbreaking I need this on my life😂
Damn can I get some donations for my build bro!😂
Should have put the wagon wheels on that bit**
This is actually a good ad for how durable Ferraris are lol
Let me drive that shitttt !!!! Lol yeeeeeyeeeeeee

He has fun, that's all I give a sh** about
me blood is red , red is ferrari , i'm a ferrari. plz don't take me off road or pressur wash me.  Thank's, a lot.
Mate I’m a single father of 3. Wife died of the big C. My eldest boy loves your videos. I had to tell him you are a car tester 😂! 400k is life changing money just saying. I could put all three through university! ✌️❤️🇦🇺
Is this Forza Horizon?
You need to put a warning that says this video is for entertainment purposes only so you can't get sued
🤣💀👍🏼🥃🇺🇸
Isn't this what they used for the commercial? I seen it.
I’m confused because it looks like you through everything but the kitchen sink
bros playing forza irl
Forza Horizon IRL
Just to destroy it cmon I’ll take it shi I need a car
Roll over the Audi, Lamb, & Ferrari with Monster Max
would do the same, ur a G.
The last item someone threw 😂😂😂
It's crazy how things are. This car in Brazil costs 2 million BRL (1 USD = + - 5,20 BRL). RIght now i'm in need of 4k USD to buy a 150cc motorbike so i can support my family by doing delivery services and this guy just blows 100x this value just for fun. Crazy!
A mug mi je oddać
Volumen. 2 F50 RALLY
Badly built?
Geisteskrank
have the courage to really destroy it, don't pretend
this might be the best thing we see all year love it
Did not think it would make it up that hill. Pretty fucking impressive lmao. Rally car baby fucking legend.
the end 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The car bubble part at the end made me smile. Lol. Thats hard to do.
I don't really like Ferrari, but that thing sounds amazing😂
Me in Forza be like
ferrari hella sue you bro 💀💀
Am not worried about the car it's  the ladder which is been tortured
Saw a few seconds of them driving the car, didn’t show there face but there was only one guy that would do this.  Whistlindiesel 😂😂
hey can i borrow this car for a few weeks?
Buy me Ferrari pls
😂❤
ferrari will be mad at this 😂🤣
Freaking awesome! ;-)
came across this guy/video by accident    god help us all if this is what todays kids find “cool” and attractive. Super destructive mindset
Tragedy. Why.
Total A-hole.
This should be a Ferrari advertisement
The bubble is more durable than the car… I smiled this entire video, that’s normal for a whistlin diesel video. 😅😂🎉
Forza horizon in real life
I want to see @whistlinDiesel buy a ripsaw and beat the hell out of it!!!!!!
The most beautiful car I've seen.
Baller Bro! Are you blacklisted from future Ferrari purchases?
"its a safety feature" lol
You will banned buy Ferrari
Should have made a Amazon link to that bubble I bet you woulda made bank
It certainly doesn't end there
Hey Cody, you think the Ferrari might be bulletproof? Can you do a video of that, asking for a friend! Thanks in advance
the end reminds me of how to basic and i love it
He needs to get a tesla and destroy that bs
I’m disappointed in you you have so many sign in the front but forgot the f bide sign
Kup mi takiego
Why?
If they don’t use this as a ad for that car bubble they lackin
Man f the car but now someone's gotta pick up all that stuff LMFAOOOO
Why 😭
I love any ferrari, but I see nothing wrong with this video. Giving a middle finger to those people that just buy a car and leave it sit for years and never drive it. He'll yeah man.
I always wanted a Ferrari great video.
Yes.
Ferrari gonna be pissed
Sei un coglione, tu e quelli che la pensano come te...
-110k from your bank
Look at me I'm rich I get to break expensive stuff.  Does this guy try to be boring on purpose? yawn
Imagine seeing a lift kit on a Ferrari
Perfect rally car
It's much easier to destroy something than to create something. Fascinating "content".
I really wish you would test that car balloon  with a javelin  not the Olympic  one but the US military  one
do it with a porsche its unkillable .... i think lol
good thing you didn't DESTROY it like it says in the thumbnail
13:20 me when my mom asks for my report card after i put it away and i start franticly looking for it in my drawers
Dude, you just sold more inflatable car condoms than anyone else in history.
Ferrari probably committing suicide after seeing this
bro you have no idea how cheap those glove are without the ferrari logo on it jeez
someone please sue these people
Don’t see the point of doing this to be honest , just to say look at me I have money
Please please Do a durability test on a superbird!!!!! That would be the greatest video on the internet.
Probably made a commercial for the protective inflatable shell that paid fo half the cos5 of the car!
you have something wrong with your head, any mental problems, have you ever had an examination? pathetic, that's what happens when you have too much money, kid
you have something wrong with your head, any mental problems, have you ever had an examination?

Ferrari on reaper wheels
You better try cybertruck when it come out, try to destroy it
Forza horizon on real life
This guy knows how to have fun.. I'll do the same
I just want to know where all the money comes from. This is awesome😅
Who would drift a $400,000 Ferrari in a field? These guys would.
It’s about time. Done spending your wife’s money. Finally made us a video, lol😁🤣😂
So you guys just have a lifetime supply of things to throw at the car or?😂😂😂
Not going to lie, you’re one hell of a driver dude.
you can have money ..... you can do what you want ... but ther is something you cannot .... never .. .buy ...... respect!
in 2029: i bought a 300B rocket just to destroy it
I didn't even knew this channel exist, but I thank you SO MUCH for letting people know about what this company is doing. When I got noticed how dirty this company is with all of these lawsuits, I got so angry, that I can't even understand why ANYONE would like to drive this car. I hope people will realise what ferrari really is and if anyone see this car on a street don't admire it, but do the opposite, really. They need to pay for it, especially for the charity called "Purosangue" which they really wanted to destroy just because they wanted to steal the name from them.
its a combination of cringe and smile at the same time haha
13:30 enough!!!!
🤣🤣🤣 Hilarious I can't believe you did that to a F8 🤣🤣🤣 that's a $900,000 car In Australia.  Such a Beautiful car to lol
You should Cummins swap it
They can't sue you its your car do what ever u want to it
GTA Online be like:
its funny to watch but also pain
Wow that's a cool sports car
If you destroy the bugatti I will be grateful
i'm looking this from france and I laughed all the video, carry on your vidéos they are so good !!! <3 thank you
Can i have that ferarri? 😢
I’m gonna sue you for stealing my horizon 5 gameclips 😂
The quick switch to Doug Demuro's "THIS" had me fucking rolling
Clearly afraid to properly destroy it. Just... why, anyway?
Κακομαθημένο κωλόπαιδο, μόνο κλωτσιές θες! Μπασταρδο!!
You didn’t hope Ferrari banned you
Molto stupido il video, molto stupido il pilota, molto stupida la Ferrari che consente a certi idioti di sbeffeggiare un'opera d'arte....
POV me playing forza
Swedish material💪🏻
Hei. Put some dirt tires on to get better traction!
lawsuit on the way XDD
Literally me in GTA

How did the thing not even end up scratched after all that. Might trade in my hunting jeep for one of these 🤔

In Vietnam its cost 1m2 milion dollar :(
U guys forgot to throw the kitchen sink at it 🤣🤣🤣
the video could be nice if was nit with this idiot
Ending for me
One of the only men that actually use these cars and not as intended which makes it 100x better 😂
I was waiting to see a screaming rubber chicken fly in at the end 😂
That was freaking awesome, but now it's time to demolition 😈
Ferraris are cool as hell, unfortunately the company exists
cheated on you for money
Its like a 13 year old kid playing forza Horizon 5 in real life.
when he starts spelling the https i lost it. haha chinesespyballoondotnet
Could be crazy but the Ferrari doesn’t look good lol. It’s such an ugly car
7:04 😂😂

It must be nice to be that rich to mess up a nice ride
Am I the only one who noticed the lambo car cover.
😬
Your videos suck dick. Support the economy and help people out vs wasting money
I can barley afford my mustang lol
idiot
That big bubble aint gonna protect it for much longer....
Rip dude
Dude is playing Forza in real life
this is how it working
Ferrari covered in Lambo cover 🗿
This reminds me of Dolph Lundgren movie Joshua Tree
Instead of suing them Ferrari should just make this video their advertisement 🤷🏽‍♂️
Part 2 pls
Oh my god!  I have to say out of all the videos He has done!  This video had me just rolling from start to end laughing whole time.  I like watch stuff all time on YouTube in mornings!  This had me choking on my coffee whole time!  This why I buy the jars of car parts well worth investment! LOL
I got the notification today🤡👍🏻
Mans face so oily he could solve the global oil crisis
If this video is a commercial for the car bubble wrap and they paid you 500 000 k in advertisement, well you made it work !
Your trash bro your just wasting money then buying a new car and then destroy it
hehe Ferrari git gud
The epitome of idiocy...
Totally worth watching the ads 👌 👍.  the end is hilarious 😂.. shit just kept coming I was waiting on the KITCHEN SINK LOL
13:21the part that you came for.
🧎🏽‍♂️my dream car dude
He's a Moron
Yes
I wish i had a friend like you
yeah still stupid enough to extend a ladder thinking it’s gaining mass😂 laid it down like a girl on top of the bubble and run like forest gup doing anything
was there not a 2nd video on this car ? did it get removed?
The GTA vibes of this video are unmatched ahhaha
You forgot to do something important..... Paint it in Barbie Pink....
Ferrri lawsuit coming soon
Damn :) I m going to Follow up
I cannot imagine suing somebody over what they do to their own property. 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Dude plays GTA in real life
Cut the fenders and throw in some 30s with no lift
Waste of money
Playing Forza Horizon IRL
hater comment here: YOU CAN NOT DESTROY A MONSTER TRUCK
This is the most triggering video on the internet...  Like a Rollercoaster of Emotions,I could only imagine the hurt car people are going through...😆😆😆   Best Troll I have ever seen and probably the most expensive,but as long as the man is having fun ✌✌  Who wouldn't love to be able to do this.....Nobody!!!  Awesome video 🤘👍👍
i you will sell this car you could feed hungry kids but i see you prefer break this expensive car consider what you do
That's why i preffer Lambo, you buy it it's completelly yours.
you should raise it and go rock climbing
Buy me a car, please.  I won't destroy it.
Bro Really play Forza Horizon IRL lol
Laughed the whole way thru this video
Driving in Forza Eliminator be like:
how to get banned from buying a Ferrari speedrun
Hope you're gonna be blacklisted by Ferrari immediatly, and I also hope you're gonna use your money for more useful purposes in the future. You're entitled to do whatever you want for the stuff you legitimately bought, but consider the passion and the hard work and the respect people put into making your Ferrari, things that you probably don't deserve. Best wishes to your channel.
Scared for lawsuits? Why would we be, almost no one owns one around here.. It's like, you're living in a bubble, but kudos, it was fun to watch, and I mean that non sarcastically!
Vorrei essere ricco come te.. Ma non col cervello che hai
Forza irl
I really hope Ferrari see your video and condemn you for abusing their brand in such a way
I can't stand Ferrari. If I buy it I can do what I want will it. Im so happy to see this man with a Ferrari 🤣🤣
One of the most satisfying video Ive ever seen
Finally 🤣🤣
You should have No money for some time and then you will thought what you are doing
This is something I'll only do in a game 🎮.
Bro u not normal
Suggestion for the next high-end sports car you get you should either get hydraulics on or Jack it up and squatted just to bother people lol.
I think it's completely ridiculous for a company to sue someone after they have bought something from them especially if they completely own and don't owe any payments on it. It shouldn't matter if they go run it over with 100 monster trucks as long as it's paid off it's no longer the company problem.
7:57 me when looking for barnfind in forza
The parts just didn’t stop flying at that bubble 😂💀. Can’t wait to see where this goes!
Needs diesel engine   don't kill it put Cummins in it
why tho

If Ferrari sends you a Cease And Desist Order, will you please make another video, about it?
I have checked with Farraris lawyers and it seems that you are safe from litigation, for now.
4:36 poor Audi
In reality Ferrari should pay you to use these clips in an ad lmao
THE LIMITOR SOUNDS HEAVINLY KEEP IT UP MAN!

Gta shit
Gta in real life xd
Legit forza irl😂
Ferrari will gonna do shitty ban on u 😂😂😂
Best part of this video is I hate Ferrari so I love it😂😂😂😂😂
I cant wait for the update lol
Idiots destroying valuable resources. A lot of people don’t have food on their table. passed generations built todays resources and new generations are destroying them. New stupid millennium destroying what is been built for them. How long can the world hold on with this idiots. And all the idiots that subscribed are no different.
this channel hurts me, this guy doesn't know how hard it is to actually make all this money, probably never had a real job before, must be nice, anyway, still entertaining, kinda...
Какая красивая шляпка мне бы такую
Straight up playing real life Forza
Me playing Forza horizon with my Ferrari
Bro they’re gonna sue the shit out this man 😂
F u
ok
Oh man. You got me laughing with the bubble. 😆  No lie though. It would actually be a lot of FUN to drive off road with a set of snow tires.  It's probably impossible you'll see this message. But if you do, trust me it would crank the rally car vibe to ten. Ferrari rally car.   Really any vehicle you test on your gravel road. The right tire would make a night and day difference.
i hate red
Oh my god  !!! My dream car Ferrari...😱😱😱😱
You are a psychopath really
The driving skills are low-key impressive tho!!
This video is definitely scarry
kinda feels like im watching my forza replays
Don’t ask me about Ferrari’s latest lawsuit.
And I’m out here and can’t even afford another truck when mine is broke down😂
No entiendo éste tipo de videos.
Guy 1  "It's terrible,"  Guy 2 "You can't say that it's a Ferrari."  Guy 1 "It's a shit box"
I'm disappointed the car... the car is totally intact I'd much rather see a brand new Ferrari destroyed than a 25 year old Skyline
Honestly I've never been more impressed with a Ferrari until watching this video
I hate you and everything you stand for.
I wonder what Ferrari would think if they see this 🤣🤔
In conclusion, ferrari makes great rally cars, and those car bubbles are actually really good
Buy abmw m5 cs snd destroyed it
I am subscribed because of this video! can't wait to see the next video.
That ending is legendary lol
Could just give it to me bro lol
enzo ferarri very angry🤣
You didn't throw the kitchen sink at it
Creo que es lo peor que he visto nunca, es muy fácil destruir cosas y no tiene sentido que encima alardes de ello
🔥
You stupid jackass!!!Hope Ferrari sue you.
Forza horizon in real life
Ferrari for sale ,excellent condition..
Real life Forza Horizon shit right here
Enzo Ferrari rolling in his grave 😂
At 7:45 did he scream or was that the car?
Demanda de Ferrari en 3.2.1
It hurts me when ever he hits the car
I had a dream about this video and its real, life is crazy
Grippin' n rippin'
Nice people are starving in this world and you are literally throwing away hundreds of thousands for nothing, why not go to a third world country and film yourself buying a shit load of stuff for people and giving that out!?
Bro i watch your videos and I would say you are funny and entertaining but how about you destroy my use truck bought that have been killing my pocket and hopefully help me getting another use one with less problems haha
The offroad part when he enters his driveway is literally Forza Horizon xD
Forza irl
This should been a commercial 😂
🤣 italian pussys need to get wet and enjoy themselves for a change🤣
This some real rich shit Lmaooo
Like a stomp video or fireworks at the bubble 🤣🤣🤣
I get the concept of the video but it just hurts to watch 😂
Ferrari has left the chat
He's doing us poor folks a favor by making the first beater f8 at a massive discount price
love the lux tickin away in the backround 8:28, good ol work bus
U should destroy a nice expensive car that u own at a car meet so people could see
You should bury your Ferrari underground for one week
Chinese spy balloon sales through the rough rn
WD just has fuck you money at this point 😂
Why?
Im just surprised farreri even sold the car to him, I remembered when that got mad at that one youtuber that took his offroad. And i haven't watched this yet, so maybe he clears up on it.
Trash ending bro
Whole different definition of Italian stallion🗿
The traction system on the ferrari is top notch, very impressive driving too.
this video is just amazing like a piece of art
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
When video games come to life😍🫠
there’s literally poverty in this world, and we have people like him doing stuff like this for views.
I'm home crying because the cops took my $2000 BMW and you guys are destroying a $400,000 Rari 😭🤦🏼‍♂️ FML!!!!!!
Dudes literally living in forza
Bro takes "you gotta spend money to make money" to another level!
I wonder why they didn't think of throwing all those cases behind
the guy that sold you the blue sqated truck from knows poping cluth
I would have liked this vid if the car would have been destroyed but now I am only thinking of your unnaturally white teeth. Sorry, bro!
The cease and desist is coming soon...
hey popen cluthes he says he owns 10 sqated truck
Can't wait for part 2 when Ferrari sues lmao
So relieved he didn't actually destroy it lol
Ngl this video was a bit of a disappointment
Guy is playing Forza Horizon 😂
POV you're off-roading in your supercar in Forza Horizon
Does anyone else just want to smash his head in
This me in gta fr
Whistlin driving is magnificent
Umm, ramp + speed?
What a good car bubble ad
I agree that Ferrari is overreaching so I'm not a fan. Still, that was painful to watch. A spoiled brat destroying a $400K car for views and just because he has money? OK kiddo.
I feel like he listened to my idea of destroying an exotic etc car or maybe some balencies
bros slowly becoming plainrock123
Ferrari reply’s
That’s looks like A liberated Ferrari” be free Rrari be free 🤌🏽🤌🏽🤌🏽
It's official you fuckin suck. I've always loved ur videos but u crossed a line.
how could Ferrari be mad they just got paid 400k for someone to do a torture test and promote it I don't see how to could be to angry
Hi it's me again. Just asking if you and your crew can buy me and my wife and children a family van.. Please. You buy so much to destroy it. Please buy us a family van. That's all. God bless you all.
I was willing to watch you destroy Ferrari I can’t wait till they put out of business
No ladders were harmed in the making of this video
I...... I just don't know what to do with my life anymore. Every second he damages something I actually get goosebumps lol 😂
Ferrari wanted level 🤣
You are an idiot!
I about pissed myself when the crutch comes flying in and hits the cover😂
Perfect weather, but *snow* would be nICE!
Homeboy is playing Forza Horizon IRL
this is how Rich man still not feel happy within his heart, wasting money to do stupid stuff
Or any car that you don’t want it
Bro 100% about to be black listed 🤣
You can just give it to me instead of destroying it  And make me the happiest person on the world
Hell yea dude keep the hard work man love this shit
When I saw the title of the video, I said in my head "Omg hes gonna get sued"
The bubble scene, top clip of all time guys, but you need more drone shotz
oh man best of luck for the future u are looking at a multi million dollar law suit RIP my man
This man has come so far I still remember watching his first vids 😅 just crazy how far you come brother man keep it up 💸
Pathetic
Hey Cody 👋, you've tested the Hilux so what about a 1990 Nissan Patrol with a TD42 engine in it, (So its fairly comparable to the Hilux which was diesel. you can probably get one from Australia or Japan, I don't know if one would be in America for sale.
As a car lover I can’t watch this
I am crying.  Most beautiful car and you did this? 😣
First thing I think of when you say it I think how long it takes to destroy.
WhistlinDiesel playing real life forza bada$$
Wrap it around a tree you fucking pussy. Holy shit boys, I think Cody is finally going soft. I was honestly disappointed by the lack of destruction in this video. Didn't realize Cody was succumbing to click bait titles. Must really need the money back from that Ferrari..
there is a supra in the back were can i get that car
This guy literally play gta V in real life jajaja i love it
my dream car is in the back in the first part
tbh ur a sped
Let's see what Ferrari has to say about this lol
The hammer dodge 🤣🤣 13:18
I’ve done worse
This was extremely hard to watch 😂
7:40 going up mnt chiliad on your supercar
Why
I don’t like Ferrari because of all the legal bullshit that’s why I waited so long to watch. I am SO happy he’s making fun of the company lol
What an idiot.
Hes not in danger. He is THE DANGER
13:00 is non one gonna talk about the hundreds of cases??? They are probably smugglers lol
Forza Irl
A bugati next
Let me learn how to drive a car in it 😏
Forza in real life 🔥
FFS....drop the second part of the video! I am suffering from severe withdrawal here... so pretty pleas?  /mutch love from sweden
But its a prank!! 😂❤️
How can he afford all this
@target = Ferrari /Cast taunt
Skeeter Bronson crying rn😆
페라리..그렇게 탈거면 나 줘..  Ferrari..if you're going to ride like that, give it to me..
why so many ladders lmao
All the rich old folk different like look at the guy sitting there mad asf whistlin got it like that 🤣
If some one can read this some one is on here with a fake whistlin desiel account trying to say you won a prize or giveaway having you go to telagram to send you pictures of a new car or truck you won and saying all you need to do is send 400$ for shipping and won’t prove it’s him and the account has 0 subscribers and is rude and definitely not the real him I was really exited I thaught it was really him and was real but turned out to be a scam really sucks there is people like that out there not the first time I’ve been scammed and I know winning a car is rare and sounds to good to be true I’ve never won anything like that and I know sounds dumb but he is listed as the real whistlin Diesel with the same picture just trying to warn people if they get that message
lift it or ill buy a squated truck.
I love WhistlinDiesel because he love’s Toyota Hilux more than a Ferrari
The dude reminds me of a girlfriend I knew, she was such a bitch!!!
This is one of those rare times I do hope that Ferrari sues someone and wins. What an eternal douche.
Its so painful to watch...
Farari after watching this video : wtf is going here  😂
wheres the suspension / short , video at?
Hey man where can I send you one of my company hats?
that is good
Glad you aren't scared  The most helerious one yet.  I was more sad for the old 79 Ford than any of that junk. Lol
bro why 😭
what a fucking waste of time and effort put into a car just to destroy it
You know, I'm *The law* and my friends at Ferrari are preparing a special legal case for you
This looks like a video game because it’s the only place someone would have tried it, until now!
Mala khra 😳
I have to say that I'm sure nobody's ever made a video like this!
drop a cummins in the rari
please build a legit rally ferrari
You are a complete wanker mate. I can only dream of owning a masterpiece like this and you trash it. If you want to piss money up the wall then good luck to you but you could be helping those less fortunate than you with it. I hope Enzo puts a hit on you from the grave for this.
It's like he's playing gta in real life
Having the bubble test go for way too long in the last clip was seriously genius, it made my day and was hilarious
what are all those boxes stacked against the wall?
He be like ferrari for sale low mileage400 miles offroad
Sell me the engine homie
Forget the price of the Ferrari, how does WD afford to have Ed Sheeran in his videos ????
The disrespect for putting lambo cover on a Ferrari
😕
Life is pretty much complete  I got through the video before the FBI, Ferrari Bureau of Investigation takes it down. Yes 👍
That is a beautiful machine
I’m sure your dad worked for you F cracked
You notice other channels … the views never match the subscriber count but when diesel drops a video almost his entire subscription count watches it immediately
Um...Did anyone but me realize he had a Lamborghini car cover on his ferrlali too
Waiting for lawsuit xD
Entertainment at best and your right people can hate but you make it off the views,great stuff man
Premium hilarious exclusive content considering how Ferrari won't even sell a car to 99% of the population
ohh that hurts
Playing real life gta
he achieved what he wanted to do with that $400K. It's only been 5 days and this vid has already accumulated 4.3M Views which is few Mil off from his number of subs. Imagine how many more $$ he's going to bring in with this vid... god damnnnnnnnn.........
Fuck yea I need your life lol
Sold his soul for money
I want cry

Advertise for bubble protect car😂
cringe
Gimme a hummer 🤣
You pursue your intrusive thoughts and I love it.
i feel stupid by watching this guy
Finally a car I don't care about. Apart from the squatted crap I'm happy to watch this get destroyed.
13:38 gimee the Hammer 🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨
https://youtube.com/shorts/WHtjOuR3wn0?feature=share
Brooo pleaase. Instead of destroying that ferrari just give it to mee 😩😂
Literally based gta player

0:40 Little did they know under that Lamborghini huracán EVO cover it's actually a Ferrari f8.
bro is living life to the fullest
U got Me this time
That was one of the best product tests ever!
the commercial ferrari always wanted to do 😂😂
Justin Bieber laughing while watching this
Bro I looked at the title and my heart stopped for a solid 7 minutes and then I went to hell and was forced to watch the explosion 😂 W video ngl
whistlin please buy my truck i dont care what you do to it but its a 2007 ford f350 kin cap long bed dually offroad package and lifted. it has a sinister diesel full intake kit and a bunch of other mods. ive been trying to sellit but nobody in my area needs that big of a truck so please buy it off me i would love to see it in a video.
3:18 :D
Am I the only one who likes his videos before I even start to watch it?
Engineers probably love watching these videos, the only time their creation is actually going to be tested to its maximum
i use to do that too but only on gta v
Ferrrarrrrarai has been a little b for a long time now they are almost cringe culture now Lamborghini exists because they a b
They just kept throwing things😂😭
the amount of clean up for the videos tho...props to them
You made me want this car! Now I just need to find 400K
Tbh that was good PR for that bubble....
11:05 that shit was satisfying
wouldn’t destroying 400k defeat the profit from the vieo
If that's a real Ferrari I'm the king and queen of England and the president of the United States and own Amazon and Walmart and have more money than Elon musk and bill gates put together
Forza horizon would be proud...you have accomplished to do what we do in car games lmao
Thats failed RP
bro is playing gta in real life
Amazing ending lmao
I'd still buy it for full price.
🤣🤣🤣next set of fan boys welcome to the club 🤣🤣🤣
I think im the only person with a different opinion... I hate watching ppl doing this to flawless machines, that the only purpose of them, is making ppl happy.. even the most grumpy person in the world, will smile alone, when passing a tunnel flooring that v12 to the max.
He’s playing gta in real life
a donk Ferrari would be nice
Howwww
Is this guy multi billionaire 🤔?
I just honestly can't understand why you would want to do this to a car but oh well its not my money
Why is the Ferrari covered with Lamborghini cloth
Forza horizon be like...
@sobhi001 just mad he could even get a totaled one
As a car guy I was entertained and hurt
n ext hes going to buy the USA and wreck it lmao
WhistlinDiesel is the real life GTA hahaha
Peak internet.
Do they make them in China these days?
just imagine how high his insurance is
$carlosjuan504
Y’all sell chairs?
Sup whistlindizzle!
Lol buy an Enzo and Destroy It lol you won’t!   😂
Sponsor me a hellaphant and 2.5 Rockwell and a 79 Ford bronco
Dude purrarii should pay you for such a magnificent commercial how can you miss such an opportunity and show how amazing it is to do wtf you want with what you put hard earn money too
Basically Forza Horizon when you take a supercar offroad haha. I love it.
Man yall gotta get some all terrians on the rear tires for the trails. That would be a blast.
7:40 me and the boys in FH5 driving supercars in the mountains
I absolutely hate Ferrari, i would love if you destroy more
Wait this is where the bubble ferrari is from? lol
bro that car was made for that xD
Incredible
Italians are not as scary as they were ahahahahaaaahhaa XD
Gonna laugh when he does get sued by Ferrari. You should have chosen a different brand to be on the safe side. Koenigsegg can not be totaled. Why compare they are made to have parts on spare, for races
At the last of the video that was hilarious 😂 he was running for his life from that hammer
Well this is obviously clickbait because he did not destroy the fckn car, fkn bullshittin asswipe.😂
I bet that sounds awesome in that holler...
You can go ahead and bring back those construction site signs from my job site 😂😂😂
You are a maddog cody
i hate this but love it so much!
This is just as exciting as the first time I started watching you're videos with a green Lambo. Lambo, Kedela, Ferrari owe you for advertising.
I can’t recall being this happy ever,  I absolutely love what you do!!   Watching your Ferrari play in the dirt/mud is what I call Tits & 🍻  keep this shit going!!!!
😭 bruh at least send me parts from it that I can get some $$ to spend it on some 🥩
lmfao
I swear I saw a flash of it in pieces but couldn't find it again.
13:30 I was expecting a kitchen sink.
You idiot!!!
As a car enthusiast, this annoys me!
STOLEN VALOR!!!
Bro is legit playing Forza irl
How does he have so many ladders?
Bro my dream car is just a 100 thousand dollar Porshe and you’re spending 400 thousand dollar on a Ferrari just to destroy it 😒
Another title name: Breaking Ferrari's until we get sued
WhistlinDiesel and Gary Clark Jr. the artist need to get together. I’m really good at mixing different backgrounds together. Trust me. Would be a very high watched video!!!
Ferrari Blacklist has entered the chat.
Forza horizon be like
this i so cringe
I had a huge laught with the latther screams , and holy crap... somebody was firing bursts at the end xD. Cody i love your Humour man. keep up the good work!!!
Quad headlights, roll cage, full body bull bar, lift, off road tyres etc? Jumps and serious testing?
I hope Ferrari sues the shit out of him
Forza horizons reallife
Now all you need to do is put wheel and exhaust holes in that bubble so you can drive around with it on the car.
The end was the best part
slap on Ferrari
i kneed a new car. have an extra one.
you should drive a lowrider/hopper through a swamp !!! 🤣🤣🤣🤟🤟🤟🤟
11:42 "protect it from helicopter crashes" 👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀 Is this thing gonna learn how to fly at some point in it's probably short life?...comparing Nissan to purrari? 🤣
man plays GTA in real life
Savage 😅
It would be a shame if someone were to put lamborghini wheels on a ferrari🙄 (There are lamborghini wheels going for 4500 here in Idaho)
How to put yourself on Italy's black list
Thumbs down - not because I love the car but for your irresponsible behavior
This is probably the best advertisement of ferrari that makes me wana buy one now.🤣
What an Edgelord
Amigo you should become an astronaut everything else gets boring for you too quickly before you get killed because of some nonsense
definitely tops ss717

Toys are meant to be played with. Love it
Ferrari Side Mirrors: Lawsuits may be closer than they appear.
God it's hurts so much but feels so good at the same time. It's awesome to how much abuse these cars can take
This contend how you interpret things, that's too high for me ... I have to get to that level first!
You’re an awful person
And yet people are starving to death and normal people like to see things like this instead of feeding and saving a lot of people just facts nice video btw
I apologize for loosing faith in you Mr. Whistlingdiesel. I thought you had run your course. I thought you put yourself out to pasture. I thought you were growing old. Again you have exceeded my expectations for the level of mayhem and obliteration. I’m glad you found a vehicle that can handle whatever you dish out. Loving everything you do and I am looking forward to seeing more annihilation very soon. 🎉
Another candidate for Ferrari's blacklist 😁
i liked you... until this video...  I love Ferrari and I find this offensive... fuck you...
Finally someone else that could give a shit about those pieces of overpriced garbage, hell yeah brother 'Merica
Cody just made the best advertisement ever for that balloon garage.
N there is me thinking “I would treat that car like a diamond”
This is even more fun than the old TaxTheRich YouTube videos thrashing exotics.
Making me want to buy cars and destroy them lol love the content!
4:39 he’s like “okay I will write that down”😂
Imagine hiking the the TN hills just to hear a modified Ferrari screaming through the forest.
To be fair... *Could've gone a lot harder than you did*
Get a awd car and abuse it...something super expensive and rare 🤔 🙈
I can imagine some conservative businessman buying Ferraris, and owning them for years, and still not achieving a fraction of the amount of fun, you had filming this video.
This guy is my spirit animal!!
He’s playing real life gta 6
bro plays beamng in real life
Stupid kids with Money... Man are getting strange these days
I like Ferraris and would never treat one like this. However, I wholeheartedly LOVE how this video is one big middlefinger to Ferrari! That company should let the customers do what they want with the cars they buy. I'm guess I'm still holding a grudge for when Ferrari made Deadmau5 dismantle his beautiful and EPIC Nyan Cat Purrari just because they didn't like it. Beautiful cars. Deeply ugly company!
Not that I care about the damn car I'm glad you destroyed it lmao. But how did you buy one when I tried they said you had to own one already. They don't sell to just anyone. So I said say fuck your car club
Fix mij dan 1k ipv deze vid 00
Best endorsement for the bubble garage you can buy.
Casually throwing the entire shop onto the car😂
i can tell that every one had fun at the end 😅
What’s up with all those boxes
This actually hurt to watch
LOL!! I believe that it does work.  Funny as well THANK YOU!!!! As always YOU had me LMAO!!
The video ended up being a Ferrari advertisement, incredibly brave car 😂
You continue to make my day! And you started a new F8 club
Bro the air compressor is $250 lol
This is the painfullest thing I have watched in a long time holy shit, but it is so funny. Awesome video man! ￼
Why u coulda just gave it to me 😂
As a car auction employee....*sigh*... Ive come to appreciate all vehicles.   I was completely fine when you were sending clapped out cars and trucks flying, I almost choked on dinner when you were thrashing the R32's.   First thing I said when I saw this title was, (determined face)he must be stopped!  lol
Wheres the rest of the video ?? "Did you eat it"
Did you really though? Would you have done it if you couldn't monetize it on YouTube still?
What a great ad for the protective bubble, very extreme durability test.
HOW SO MUCH STUFF 😂 13:36
this is me in gta 5
You should buy and destroy a stance car because they are basically the squatted trucks of the car world
Forza horizon in real live 🤣
Vergognati a trattare così la nostra Ferrari. Spero che Ferrari prenda seri provvedimenti vedendo questo.
He's playing forza in real life
Sei un pezzo di merda, credo di parlare a nome di tutta l'italia

How to get ban by Ferrari step 1 :
So idiot
Love it
Oh my god
Hahaha loved the edits subscribed within the first 2 minutes
I would like to watch you destroy toy cars under your military boots
I don’t understand how you afford to do this with such an expensive car. I could be totally wrong but I doubt this video brings in $400k+ taxes, fees, and all the other expenses that that it takes to produce this video. Crazy but at least your coming up with your own original content. Thanks for that, keep up the good work
It hurts seeing this car being broken but it’s so damn entertaining
It has a lambo cover 💀
Man drove his ferrari like a forza player
You flippin’ twit
Cease and desist
You threw everything except the kitchen sink. Lol Good stuff
Forza horizon 5 real live
"It's a safety feature" "It's a drain"  I could really use that hood bro
omg...13:45 made me lose it. All that crap coming non stop got me.
Ferrari after watching this video: never let anyone sell him a Ferrari again 😂
Liar
never ever in my life would i have thought i would see some Forza horizon shit come to life bro what the fuck its actually disgusting the amount of money this fucking brain dead kid makes
Capyrarri
This is an insult to Ferrari, shame!
NOT THE RC CAR!!
I think you are the biggest idiot in the world and for this video MUST HAVE BEEN SUED BY FERRARI ! I HOPE with all my heart that you will go to TRIAL BY FERRARI ! I will personally send this video to FERRARI ! You destroy on purpose a piece of art!
Dude playing Forza in real life 8:08
New video idea, “is a Ferrari bulletproof”
OK but this is so capable offroad
Lmao 🤣
I hate you....people are starving and you throwing 400k away for content you are sad get a life
You are a depresiv idiot
Wow more power to him I just don't see why you would destroy such a beautiful car!I would love to own a car like that someday I certainly couldn't justify destroying it for some likes and comments
Title should say "I brought a $400000 Ferrari and destroyed it so you don't have too"
Cease and Desist Speedrun 🥰
Honestly this video just displays how durable this Ferrari is
how I am supposed to feel
Can you send me about $150,000 to pay my house off or a Ferrari 🥹 I wanna do some crazy shit like this with you bro 🤙🏼
"Ferrari wants to know your location"
Ferrari is just punching air right now
I hate Ferrari more than you so I watched this.
Monsterrari
That idiot in the video comment you showed saying you're a broke boy obviously has no fucking clue who you are
bro is taking beamng drive too much seriously
Idiot!
Now more ppl want to buy Ferraris
Bro, You are the shit! Honestly you're the best fuckin content creator out there IMO!!! Love every second of it brother, Keep on Keepin On 🤙 Lifes A Garden, DIG IT! Haha
I haven't laughed so hard on a video in while 😆
10/10 on the Protective Bubble section
I could not careless about Ferrari and the BS about lawsuits, it is a car, a car is a property by definition. You paid, you can do whatever as long as it is legally OK,  like not hurting people, animals or other people's properties. It is expensive, you like burning money, it is not wise considering we live in a world where people work hard for it.
A Ferrari in a lambo Evo rap😬💀 My Brother: are you trying to get sued😡
Thicc-fil-A 🤣🤣🤣
That bubble is a quality product. Let the games begin.
"Hello there! I recently watched your video where you bought a $400,000 Ferrari with the intention of destroying it, but I was disappointed to see that you only caused some minor damages to the car. The title of the video made me think that I would see the car completely destroyed. Can we expect a part two where you actually follow through with your intention? I'm looking forward to seeing the destruction of the Ferrari, not just a clickbait title. Thanks!" 💪😂👍
Thanks Whistlindiesel
Dude's a fricking DA idiot. Pretty sad that you have to get attention that way.
Uou!!!!!!!!
Gta for real
Why you did that why the por man he's sad 😢 now plis give mony to por man ok to go to jana
The camera man: "my car won't even come up this hill"  Show him it will cody!!
Knew is was Doug as soon as I heard "THIS!" Wasn't even looking at my phone
Dudes playing forza on his property and I’m here for it lol
seeing a Ferrari rally and fuckin slide on dirt is the funniest but most cursed thing I've seen in a while
Ok listen you should get a squatted truck and go to one of the meets and destroy the truck in front of them
Damn nice of Shmee to give you that car! 😉
Imagine buying a car giving Ferrari money promoting their company  having fun with it then they sue you lol imagine that
They say they are “Italians” and there cars are just sooo elegant. But they forgot one thing about selling them in the USA, rednecks.
WITHOUT BRAIN. COMPLETALY CRAZY .
Plot twist: Its a lease
Aw whislen you never fail to suprise me 😂
GTA IN REAL LIFE
When forza horizon consumes your life!
my nails are gone...
Bs title click bate car still looks new
Please not the Vossen Rims
Ferrari are going to take this guy to the cleaners 😂😂😂
DUDE HE HAS A SUPRAAA OMGGGG
That Way I love your video
Watch Ferrari sue him lmao 🤣
You should do video where you take car for some serious paint restoration and take the guy with you and wreck the paint. Those guys are serious of that.
Me: *buying a car bubble so I can live inside it while it protects me from everyone’s bullshit*
i love how he covered it with a lamborghini car cover hahaha he knew what he was doing
https://youtu.be/128irpu3de8 Russian classic car
somehow i feel like if one day broken people catch that dude they will kill him
That shizz is hilarious at the end xD they even were cracking up.
can I have it? That would be something
Be careful, Ferrari likes to sue their customers lol
I think he went with the phrase "don't buy a car just to store it in your a garage" a tiny bit to far
demands for ferrari's after this ^^^^
@ferrari make something with this shit(guy)
Late but you should do a Honda Ridgeline vs Ferrari off-road durability challenge
Yea man
The definition of this guy:he is a stupid shit
Ferrari has to feel horrid for that exotic lol
This video makes me want a Ferrari, but the next video will probably change my mind on that
Blacklisted
You are an idiot…you are doing this for views…..stupid shit.  You have  no social life.PIECE OF SHIT WITH 2 EYES

this ferrari is someone's dream car and it costs 400,000 and you destroy it just because it had fucking reviews and you could get reviews in much nicer ways, for example like mr beast you donate money to someone who needs it or give that ferrari f8 that you destroyed
it sounds insane

WOW That's a cool fast sports car
Why are you do thatt?
The thing is if Ferrari wouldn’t be so butthurt about it this would be a really good ad for them showing how good of a car it is
Can't wait to see crushed  Ferrari in a can
Is anyone else seriously curious about where he got that bubble, because god damn it did better than I expected!
This is what happens when the ford company beat them with there ford gt40 Mark 2
Uhm.... Another WD? Okay...
real life forza horizon

I'm Italian and for me this is an insult, not for the money spent but for the outrage of the historic brand more than a car it is a work of art
Lmao
Im still waiting for the Court update video.. What ever happened?

You will definitely be convicted by Ferrari.
I'm sure ferrari will be contacting you soon 😆  when in doubt throttle it out.!

Cody is definitely what happens when you don't tell your kid no and then kick his ass after he melts down .... Imagine being Cody and having to pay for sex every single time ....
boost
Enzo Ferrari doing cartewheels in his grave
No lawsuits. Ferrari is coming with a tow truck and check in their hands to buy it back.
why do they even sue because they still get money from the customer buying the ferrari?
Put some swampers on it.
irl forza
He should rally ferraris
you driving like your in forza horizion

Espero nunca más le vendan un Ferrari o cualquier otro vehículo....

awesomeeee
Sparati
What an impressive bubble!
I dare you to go to grand pas mud hole where you sunk  the G wagon
Durability test of a Hyundai I30N?
A trick WRX would be much cooler.  400 hp out of a pill bottle size pistons
I wish i had a Ferrari
Spero che la Ferrari ti metta sul libro nero sei solo un coglione
Bro your gonna get sued from Ferrari soon 😂😂😂
Turns out grand theft auto got it right with super car off roading
This kid will regret this one day
This channel always has great energy   I hope I don't get sued for commenting tho 😭
OK taking bets right now which last longer the Ferrari or the Toyota hilux?
Please Ferrari swap a 6.0
7:46 me when I play Forza Horizon
What did I just watch lol
Reminds me of driving your nice car in GTA on open land
Reminds me of driving your nice car in GTA on open land
Welp...whoever bought that Ferrari won't be buying more
Reminds me of driving your nice car in GTA on open land
Ferrari is going to have a field day with you in court, it's literally all in the fine print when buying, YOU MUST TAKE CARE OF THE CAR .  They will now put you on a blacklist for buying Ferrari's and they will sue for basically 2 Ferrari's, so roughly $800,000 lawsuit without attorney fees and its all on video what more proof do they need
Next Tavarish will have it.
Next car should be Bugatti…..
This is so immature... I love it!
Awesome video. Made my day. HECK YEAHHHHHH
This hurts my body
I'm actually pretty impressed with the car.  I never thought it would make it through everything you put it through and still come out looking as good as it does.
Man Ferrari will Never sell you again a Ferrari
ok
Ferrari is going to have a hayday with this mf🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀
The best video i ever seen
😭🤣
dawg i really felt like i was watching forza horizon irl 🤣🤣🤣
Only good Ferrari vid
congratulations in buying your first and *last* Ferrari.
Idiot youtuber!
😂😂💪🏾
Ecco ecco che da bravo deficenter hai fatto il video di merda vedi di andà a fanculo!
That protector thing  just got the best add they could get 😂
the is my first time coming across this channel and what the actual fuck ??????/
Forza pilots be like: 10:00
clickbait scammer
being a rich stupid american be like
u people are the parasites of humankind. shame on u
Damn I want one of those car bubbles now
ferrari commenting....
Why?
My favourite youtuber no.1! Ferrari handles well on dirt roads, wonder will it handle well on a mud bog?
Best pub ever for the bubble
the ending needs to be an advertisement lol
it's not A car.  u just destroyed (MY DREAMS FOR 20 YEARS) 😭 would u like to sell me that exact FERRARI for all the money i have (5K)
5:48 idc what anyone says THAT WAS SIIIICK
wait.. I think I saw this before in Low budget stories
It’s Gill from Winnipeg Canada Really love what you do bro and haters will hate that’s there job.
😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤛
i would like to buy one of those bubbles for my cadillac…. any links
You punk ! I hope you lose all your money go broke and live on the streets !
Kind of enjoyed this.  Good to see a super car actually being enjoyed and abused , these are just rich people toys in my opinion what they should be used for is exactly this
I didn’t want to see it, at the same time I couldn’t look away. Is it weird that before I never wanted a Ferrari but now I do?
Okay, I have a big complaint about this video!  Could you PLEASE teach your friends to stop ending sentences with prepositions?!  Prepositions MUST be followed by prepositional phrases like “AT the house” or “FROM your mommy”.  Thank you from a fellow Hoosier. 😊
Reminds me of Forza horizon 4 lmao😂
Why do y’all have so many ladders 😂
I’m kinda ready to see her get smashed up
Take it to a drift competition!
He knows how to live the life! Gets a Ferrari and goes and slides it on gravel roads just having an absolute blast while almost everyone else with a Ferarri is afraid to pull into a McDonald's parking lot above 2MPH.  Also.. that bubble protector surprised me. Worked way better than I figured it woukd.
Look at this kid's face, he doesn't value things, ferrarri has to sue this guy, and clean his safe, yutube had to charge him, not pay, rubbish person.😈💸
He takes on and off the plate number?
Devono bannarti a vita testa di cazzo!!! Che cazzo die esempio sei, c'è gente che neanche a fine mese riesce a campare. Vergognati, se fossi la Ferrari non ti farei mai più comprarne una!! Non le meriti, vergognati!!
this hurts me🤣
Hi idol can you please try a mitsubishi strada box type can u destroy one ❤️
A 4x4 exo-cage Ferrari would be epic.
This i the first time one of his videos left me angry afterwords.   Angry because it ended so soon. I could watch another 14 hours of this Ferrari testing. But not 15 hours, 15 hours would be irresponsible....LMAO 🤣
i was all good and amazed by the video untill i saw wait wait wait wait from my soulmate john so here is a dislike don't use that for you shitty vids
I hate this video, destroying a 400,000 dollar car is not funny. Some people can't even dream of owning a fraction of that and you're destroying it, you entitled prick.
😂😂😂
what a retarded video
It's a pity that Ferrari or some dealers sell this kind of cars to this morons
He out here playing real life Forza Horizon
love the car dude. keep up the abuse on her the insta stories are fun to watch
the grand finale was awesome.. HEX coin $0.06 PZEN coin $0.004
Pov:Friz za miesiąc
This dude lives in ohio he has the money to destroy a beautiful car 😭🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
🤮
🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is painful and I'm smiling along the whole video... I'm into bdsm I guess
Ha, Before even watching the video I was about to write a comment saying "Ferrari won't let you buy another lol"
Bruh when he drops the broom
If they throw a lawsuit at you…that means you’ve done your job🤘
challenge: Jump it further than the G wagon
@10:18 OSHA must be very happy about that 😂
Can you give me this car ??
Pero no lo puso aprueba como el GTR, que paso tenei miedo?

My stomach hurts watching this 😫 I can't stop watching tho... 😆
Not sure if I was more impressed with the cover holding up to all that or the fact that you had that much stuff to throw 🤔 😂
I’m impressed by how well the ferrari handled off-road. 🤯
The broom cut scene was good! Nice video!
I just love sorting the comments by "New" and seeing all the discourse on what he can and can't do with his money. Brings me a smile to my face.
ferrari should feel proud
This is just an ad for ferrari at this point why was it not smashed over the empire state building and shot into an asteroid belt
I hate you and your video's..... HOWEVER... The ending was funny as fuck and definitely made me laugh out loud! That was fricken awesome. Therefore you earned yourself a like, a comment, and a subscriber!!! Shit i might even buy some merch to help you afford to do more dumb, but funny shit in the future! I might even comment a second time and re-watch it just to help your pocket,  you know what... Why stop there? I'll even share this to get other people to watch just cause that ending was EPIC AS SHIT!!!!!!!!!
Ferrai getting ready to sue him: 🌚
Maybe I’m stupid but what are all those boxes/crates in the back on the last scene?  Also, needs a leveling kit
I think everyone of us would still want to get that car
It ended to be a positive ferrari review after all
this is also why people hate americans because we off road lol
that bubble lmao
Kuinka vitun tyhmä ihminen voi olla?
Bro wtf I came to see the hater comments
Imagine something good comes out of this and Ferrari somehow likes the durability tests LOL
love the unfortunatley we have lost some people lol 6:12
Taxtherich American style
This is the guy which comes over the fear of "OH NO A LEAF HAS LANDED ON MY LAMBO IM SO SAD NOW " But really my heart was dying bec of this
A lifetime ferrari ban is the new flex.
So paintul😫😫
ага после такого WhistlinDiesel Ферарри запишет его в чёный список, и запретит ему продавать авто по всему миру. Кроме Б/У
This guy 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Good to know how durable Ferrari is, lol.

The driver warning part 😂😂😂
Oh boy…  Now I have the strange urge to see it lifted with some rally tires and rally lights…
do you know the tiktok food waster dude? you are the same. It's sad. There's alot more important things than doing this
#ercojonedelgiorno
FUUUCK... As a tradesman I hate to see a good ladder get thrown around.
Il grande vecchio ti avrebbe mandato un sicario. Purtroppo lui non c'è più e troppi tamarri hanno messo le mani sui suoi gioielli da allora
Hey bro ever think about any street bike durability test? I could use some info before a purchase. I could see some gnarly hill climbs on one...maybe?
pov: you just finished froza horizon
What a tool.
this is just...sad
12:24 The bubble companies stock after this video 📈📈
So awesome!!!!! Still  have the shell??!?!?! May I have the rolling shell to  drop in a custom rb30 skyline motor In it?! First ever 1k hp skyline powered Ferrari! Let's goooo!!!!!  Let's turn it into a video for your channel!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Someone's seriously having too much money.
Baseball pitching machine would prolly work much better to test the durability of the bubble. OR jack up the rear of the Hilux and turn it into a pitching machine! I mean for SCIENCE purposes of course.
lunático pela estupidez
good advertising stunt, showing western white men are toxic like Andrew Tate, and clickbait liers, because there was no damage to the product, only the environment
give me 5k :)))
This why I love watching your videos you actually have fun with stuff
That would of been even funnier if u shot a midget at after all that shit like a midget just comes flying out of nowhere after all that shit then could have put a clip from wolf of street of the guys throwing him lmfao that shit would of been fucked!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
umm you forgot to throw the kitchen sink at it. Epic fail, nice try bro...
this channel is a bad influence on the youth, like Andrew Tate, toxic westerner white men
Supa supa supa pissssss supa supa pisssss
How about squatted Ferrari?
That car bubble company’s probably going to want to use some of this footage for a commercial 🤣🤣🤣
What is wrong with you...
Props to the editing team!!!
13:14 Dude...I'm pissing myself..holy shit..it just didn't end!!
Amazing!!!!
It shows how durable a Ferrari is and free advertise lol

A lot of people are scared  LMFAO Like you and your mini 500 helicopter. Now you're just sad.

Why was this so fun to watch. And that thing did better off road than I thought it could.
Iam highly underestimating how much you can earn on youtube.
Are you in military
He’s secretly crying inside 😂
It hurts but damn this is satisfying to see that you drive it like you were in forza horizon 5
Destroy the helix come on !
Hear me out on this…. SHOOT the bubble 🤷🏻‍♂️
This is proof that some of the dumbest people make some of the most money. Life is truly strange.

13:20 is like an extended intro to Pink Floyd "Time"
I felt so much pain while watching this video. 😐
Remember, this guy is 400k in debt, we must watch 10 thousand ads a day to pay it off.
GTA 5 in real life ? 💀
Asphalt 9 legends be like:

Poor car

Seeing my dream car being abused is heart breaking but still fun to watch
This is why Lamborghini is better.
surprising how well the car did
Bro is driving this car like my RC one 💀
Che gran testa di sesso !!!!

I was cringing but I was loving it and I laughed and giggled and was cringing at the same time and also I was also pretty much also feeling tickled and also I was giggling and cringing but at the end I didn’t cringe.. I LOVED IT
You bought a horse and drove it like a horse
aahahahahah that ending :D :D :D
who burns 400.000$ usd must get some meds for sure, u spent all the money from army to do it?
Driving like he’s in pubg

You are the Devil
After all that a bird shits on the window.

Comunque alla fine è pazzesco di come questa Ferrari possa fare tutto e riportare si e no 2 graffi.
“If it’s red it’s dead” ~WD
This sucks.give me the car
WTF? Are you stupid?
This video is an obvious gem... but him rallying a Ferrari that hard was.... ;P
Why bro why😭 bro why why are you like to do this shit
Congratulations. You have become popular being an idiot.  The dictionary should have a picture of you defining dumbass.
bro can i have the red g wagon? i'll fix it 😢 it's my dream car
ahora estaras en la lista negra de FERRARI. F
Ahhhh it hurts watching this Video
that wall of crates looked like escape from tarkov try-hards inventory
imagine ferrari comments
i have never had so many mixed emotions...... two thumbs up i think... do i like this video.... yea.. i .... well no actually wait.... yea,,,,whatever
A Ferrari is artwork as much as it is a car. Would you be mad if you spent many man hours making a piece of art and watching someone destroy it? Probably. This will pain me to watch so I won't.
Real Life GTA drive
The crutches and moon boot was hilarious 🤣
CEO ferari : 👁👄👁
At list let It drive to Oder people befor disintegrating It complitly
what can i say xD
Ah yes, that's some professional demolition.
13:21 the druggie kids looking for there vapes instead of getting a life
I think the title of this video should be "Talentless hack with money buys a $400,000 Ferrari for destruction and notoriety to generate more cash"
10:31 when that one kid says he gonna tell the teacher on you
9:41 nah cuz this was cool asf reminded me of nfs or forza
after watching this, i think we are all ENTITLED TO FINANCIAL COMPENSATION!        to buy and destroy Ferrari's
Its soo traumatizing to watch this, i just got one last 2021 secondhand, i take care of the car like new born baby, very very careful.
Your getting in trouble dude
I thought it was going to be worse 😂 but the hill and off road clips were nasty ngl sounds beautiful with the pops too
I'm going to finance a 2013 Chevy spark on Monday because I'm so poor lol Some guys have all the fun
I needed a laugh this morning love the bubble😂
@4:20 𝙄𝙨 𝙩𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙖 𝙎𝙐𝙋𝙍𝘼?
Thank you for not hurting the Ferrari too bad.
Mentally stunted is what you are with nothing else to do in life!  You and everyone else who finds this funny! Go to work you moron. Take advantage and go dressed like that to the war in Ukraine since you're so prepared, and you'll take that stupid laugh off your face.
This what happens when you hand over your keys to the valet parker
This is awesome. Period, the end
Youtubers are way overpaid
so you are basically saying that you make bad financial decissions.
Give to Charity, except doing stupidity
лучше бы мне отдал!
This is like Fight Club when Ed Norton smashes Jared Leto's face in "I Felt Like Destroying Something Beautiful"

If the last throw was with a shoe 👟 it would've been even better🤣
Disgusting disrespect to the factory and those that built that car!!!!

Halfway through and I'm like he should take it to a detail shop 🤣🤣
Best ad for a bubble wrap car protection
Bro is playing Forza Horizon in real life
This money could have been donated to a food charity as lots of people are struggling in third world countries, but no ..... we had to crash a Ferrari to   support a video channel ..... 2023 life ....
Nice video
That’s defo a forza moment real sht 💪😂👌
You are fucking nuts
This is one of the situations where codey looks at the vehicle and realises oh…I probably shouldn’t destroy this
mans playing gta v in real life
Fuck he knows what to do to get those views haha..  4mill in 4 days. Mad cunt hahaha
Te stai male!
Painful to watch, but still funny.
4x4 ferrarri Monster truck
Now we all wait for video where he'll be sued😭
Now get it wrap make Ferrari cry
Yo no lo veo destrozado el coche
This is unneeded and, above all, disrespectful. What kids do for likes, today, stuns me.
What a stupid man!!!
Lift kit
I like the Lamborghini Huracan Evo Sail..
me in my first car
Ferrari will not accept this.... 🙂 not sure how. But they will not. 😅
you should get a HSV a holden ute
Bagus berik dengan aku jak bro.
This will probably ramp up Ferrari sales. Tbh, I am more impressed by Ferrari quality now, if it can survive Diesel, it can survive pretty much anything.
I love how no one mentions the car cover lol
Absolute brainless moron
I would buy this junk car if you gave me $100,000.
it is so sad to see so many people enthusiastic about videos like this one, with absolutely no content. It makes me understand why the world is going upside down and people is buying teslas hahahahaah
Forza Horizon IRL
Am in Africa l really enjoy watching your video
This is a stupid video that people should not support. I will not watch it, I will not encourage this sort of c**p.
bro only know the word DESTROY
I remember there was a time when Ferrari did a selection to whom they sell their cars, not everyone with money could buy one, too bad they still don't do that.
This guy be playing Forza Horizon IRL
Nah when he launched the hammer at him got me dead 😂
destroy stuff just to make money laugh out loud
seems like your videos are getting worse and worse
I'm literally about to lose my house in a couple days cuz I'm short on rent by like 200 bucks, i work every fucking day and its still not enough, just to see this stupid shit? 400,000 would change My liiiiife. My fucking life.
This is a good ad for ferrari actually, nobody expected to do so well. And also for the plastic cover.
Can't wait for him to turn it into a hybrid
Wheres that se* doll when u were throwin stuff on ferrari..?
The gunshots 😂😂😂
WEAK just to drive it the dirt. Should of destroyed it like you grandpa's truck.
.... And what exactly is the point of this?
Next video- i date a girl just to kill her.
Real life forza
buy me one
Idiot
Diesel is crazy
Can u make poor people fight over stuff
He just wanted forza 5 in real life ❤🤙
Please please please buy a H2 or a H2R IF YOU DARE
Ich schicke dir 100€ auf Paypal, wenn du mir die Karre nach Deutschland liefern lässt. Mehr is der Hobel nicht wert 😂😂❤️
Since you like to throw money away, why don't you give me 50k so that my family and I can buy a car, I spend almost 3 hours on public transport to go to work and I don't have time to do family life. Really please I beg you friend.
I was giggling like a little school girl the entire video 🤣🤣
1:29, don't worry, that's meant to do that.
if you can dodge a ball, ladder, hammer, drill, wrench... you can dodge a red car! 🤣🤣🤣 Also if you don't want it I can take it off your hands.
Man that shit looked at home as a rally car
finally a video where you disrespect a ferrari
Bro This Just Hurts ;-;
why did bro put a huracan cover on a ferrari 💀
What an IDIOT. Only a person that doesn’t deserve to have this amount of money can destroy a thing like that. With millions of people suffering for the war or the need of medicine you destroy a 400000$ car. I hope that one day you’ll need these money for your health. Then you will learn what this means.
Para que comprar un 4x4 pudiendo tener tu ferrari para ir por el monte jajajajaj🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Well done mate you can gift me the RC Ferrari 😅
This man is playing Forza Horizon irl
Instead of helping a brother out it melts my ❤
Superb advertisement.

Another stupid and dumb ass with 5 minutes of fame, influencers and YouTubers puff...
Zwykły debil.
As always, it's a great video, but I would love to see someone throwing a cat at this car bobble!

GTA 5 😂
I'm going to durability test my 2023 tesla plaid

Less talk, more action, so just go to 6:56 and stop watching around the 10 minute mark, the rest is tik tok cringe XD
bro driving it like he's in forza
The ending was hilarious
Dude is just racking them Forza skill points
Talking about privilege. This guys a tool. Disappear
Gta approved
People: Ferraris can’t rally drive This guy: hold my Audi R8 key

Man I have ten kids literally I really want for them all to be into trips to the dunes
車を大事にしてほしい
Damn! Best ever! Ferrari should pay this guy a lot of money for showing how their car can really stand to abuse! 😂😂😂
Clickbait?
Please help me the cops won’t leave me alone in Kendall Wisconsin 400 population please bring the Ferrari to town.
This guy makes me want to hurt him!! So much could have been done with 400,000k other than waste it on a Italian car you will destroy.
I used to think it was funny to watch you destroy cars but that ended today. Watching you on a path to destroying one of my absolute favorite cars has gutted me. I am going to lay down now.
No not again
9:40-10:15 reminds me of the drift challenges in nfs heat💯🤣
Not even halfway through and it's my favourite video yet! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Взлом жизнь
Dear Ferrari horsecock -Haha.
How many dang LADDERS does dude own? Musta been a sale at Costco!
Интересно, мне одному жалко машину?

#HaterMode : Is there a building factory of stupid guys in the USA? The stupidest videos I ever seen comes from here. And congratulations, your the winner of the category "cars". 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Hope you'll earn enough money with this video to repair your car...oh no, maybe dad will ? 😉

I believe that's the best commercial for Ferrari im very very very surprised with the durability of the car.
best car bag advertisement ive ever seen
Man I was waiting for him to climb the ladder and jump onto the bubble 😂 but instead of him his digger, that bubble would definitely hold the weight.. but also, while I'm typing wonder if Ferrari would mind if someone were to put a Ferrari sticker on a 06 Nissan wingroad 🤣
I didn't even notice they threw a Losi Baja Rey
give me a car please
forza horizon 5 real life pack
This is dumb
Ferrari will sue you because you have a lamborghini car cover
So this is what Rich people do?
Nicely done, show all these ferrari die hards why ferrari is buttcheeks
first class myran😂😅
After this video prices on Ferrari going up for sure ...
What a bunch of TWUNTS!!
Disclaimer, everything seen in this video was cgi
Ferrari joined the chat with a gift: "Cease and Desist"
I watch this video every night what a good bed time story
Bro playing gta in real life
Wow, it’s so beautiful. I also play cars, so I can take a look.🎉🎉
You could literally walk down to the street, throw 400 thousands dollars up in the air and that would of benefited humanity more than making this video.
Someone getting their money out
POV: You have too much money
Best all time video on the internet webs ever. The end is the best. If I owned the company that made that bubble.  That's the perfect commercial for thier product...  great job....
Forza horizon 6 looks off the chain!
Half of me is thinking he shouldn’t destroy it because it’s an expensive Ferrari  The other half is wondering why he hasn’t jumped it yet
I'm ded watching object after object being hurled at that ballon car
dumb.
This guy is the redneck mr beast
Who IS that in the background that keeps catching the ladders that are too small with their face?
bros playing forza
Dumbass at it again red your dead
Ferrari make FAR more money selling licensed clothes and accessories like belts and wallets than they do selling cars - they're primarily a clothing company.
This is the type of shi I’m doing in forza horizon 5
day one of me commenting about my sadness due to you destroying a perfectly ridable bike .  ways to make up for this  ----give me a perfectly ridable bike
Whistlingfagot
Lamborghini car cover on the Fezza - next time use a Prius one!
Test a rolls Royce cullinan or phantom that would get VIEWS  everyone would be butt hurt 😭 😂
Wait, can you drive it with the bubble? 🤔😂
Please drag an anchor on the highway 🚗⚓🤠
Its nice to see people doing what they want with their car. However, I did get severe anxiety thinking about all the money that was being damaged
why u dont help people or get people some cars that they dont have and they need it not 450k ferarri car jest to fuck it up im not telling u what to do im still a fan but i dont have that kind offf money but is two much help people my guy waste the money at some on who needs a car for there family or donate it
My hatred supports you 🥲
Forza Horizon in real life:
Don't let ferrari sees this ...ure  fucked up bro !!!!
You wase money you should have given to a poor people
If this says anything i think its time Ferrari makes a off road 4x4 vehicle
did anyone else catch the machine gun noises at the end when they were throwing everything at it 🤣🤣😂
This was gold that thing took it all so far and the bubble held its own congratulations on the new Ferrari 👏
Ruined a beautiful piece of art . Can’t wait to see what Ferrari does to you. Also he wasn’t wrong about Ferrari blacklisting ppl idk ab the other info but that’s a fact. I only know because my dad just purchased a red hard top California Ferrari and he was told about that when he purchased the car.
No rubber duck, I don't want to watch this channel anymore.
Dude disrespected that car like it was a beat up toyota😂
Can we appreciate the fact that not even Sheiks have this much fun in their ferraris!!! Not gonna lie I liked when he did the hill climb not even DDE can do what WD has done here and get away with it.
Bro how tf did they let him get a ferrari
I think that bubble has been the most durable thing Cody has ever had on this channel yet
pshh i do this in forza all the time
better destroy 4 squatted trucks for doing this too such a badass car lmao. this hurts me lol
Complete moron. Just an idiot with money. Could have spent 400k and done something meaningful with it like donating to charity or an orphanage instead of wrecking a Ferrari. Complete tosser.
Im afraid when u grow up and be normal, u cant buy a Ferrari even if u managed to buy a used one they wont service it for u and u will be sued for trying to fix it.. They sue Bugatti owners for buying Bugattis.. They are insane but Ferraris are awesome nothing like owning one.
The most effective ad for that bubble 😂😂
How much money is he going to make off of this car, ? Any guesses, ? I will offer to buy the engine and drive train …I call first dibs on it ..l
can u buy me a durango its not that expensive like the Ferrari
That was  cooler than the cold side of my pillow…..
You are a legend for doing this Lolol  F the Ferrari legal bs You pay for it , it’s yours and do whatever you want with it  Love it
I was actually waiting on the Doug “This” at the beginning 😭
Fucking goat
You should jump it
i love he just handles that car like nothing
Says a lot about the grip of the tires
That last clip was so funny lmaoo
That would be one hell of a commercial for that car bubble thing
Ok I’m sorry but I enjoy seeing him trash most things, but I’m a car nut and sadly a CRIPPLED DISABLED VET, and if I had the cash or honor of owning that I find a way to ride in it at least, and never ever let it get hurt..it’s going to piss me off if he jumps flips or runs it over with a bulldozer like he did that Ford truck..
Please post the link to the bubble.
Just like forza
This really hurt to watch 😢
whistilndiesel and danny duncan collab
This made me cringe so bad because that is a dream car
Telegram Messenger
Whistlin is playing Forza Horizon
The guy on the laptop when he stood on the roof lmao
I’m impressed with the balloon 🤔
ARE U BANNED NOW ?XD
Heloo Uzbekistan.Mashina.Padarki.Your...Yaa.Menn.✉️🎁🎁🛻🛻MANGA.BERING.
How about putting a kid through college, or something positive , instead of just wasting money on stuff your just gonna destroy? And exactly why do you buy nice things and just destroy them h ? Its like you don't appreciate or value anything....and its like you forget how you got to where you are now? What you did to that work of art ferrari is just wrong? Why?
Diesel js saying if l Ferrari sees this they will sue you, sb customized there Ferrari and got there car almost taken so they bought a lambo and did the same shit
Ferrari will ban any celebrity from buying their cars even from something small like getting it repoed like tyga, painting it pink like Justin Bieber or totaling their cars too many times. Just imagine the conference meetings they’re having about you 😂
What happened to your lambo?
Every man was expecting a complete silence then the most absolutely smallest thing to be thrown
I wish I had this kind of stupid rich money 😢 if I drive my car like that I need to pay thousands to fix it the next day
This hurts so much yet is wildly funny
10:00 smoooooth~
Now you wait for their seize and desist order 😭😭
Is it bad I hit like before I watch
This is one of the best vids i ever watched
Selling due to change of circumstances. Only 3010 miles, second owner
I can't watch!!!
Please keep destroying Ferraris. They can take their lawsuits and shove em up a Karen.
Next time may you please just give me the car thank you
Fuck Ferrari for being to liberal 🫢. Karen’s are gonna get mad. Fuck Ferrari for being Karen’s. Oops fuck Ferrari for being radical liberal Karen’s! Got it right that time!!
Awesome how far you’ve come. Been watching for years
Heart Broken 💔. This is my Dream car that your destroying it. Very Said to watch it
When this dude dies, let's destroy his grave, since he likes things being destroyed!

YouTubers like this are what inspires future content creators.
on the top side you will never have to pay for that pesky oil change
I smiled and laughed through this whole video what great content that ending though Had me rolling 😂😂😂😂😂
Dude is such a spoiled NOOB.  Why Would Ferrari sell him a car ?
no f's given lol
Deadmau5  got a the cease-and-desist letter from Ferrari
Bro @WhistinDiesel you gotta run from the FerrarI FBI bro they gon hunt you down...  (Im joking nice video tho)
F this f ing car abuser         Manager of Ferrari dealer
I know your in your mid 20's, grow a beard already.
Dam bro the way you boast about having so much money by destroying things people most likely never able to buy is getting old👎
how much you pay your camara man holy shit he can run fast
You don't know how bad I needed to see a video like this. YouTube has been dry for a minute. Im Always searching for your new content you never disappoint
This is just a really good advertisement for that bubble thing
😂
You’re out here playing Forza motorsports for real . Can I come out I have time lol

Great start for Ferrari's entry to Rallycross 🤌
Manz said rally
Love this shit.
Make it a rally car 🚗
Now this is a video I've been waiting to see
Non conoscevo ne te ne il tuo canale.. Ho letto la notizia su di un articolo con il video correlato.. Credo che per fare visualizzazione ormai si sarebbe anche pronti ad uccidere.. Credo che tu questo arriverai a farlo... È solo questione di tempo. Distruggere o tentare di farlo qualcosa di molto prezioso non ha altra spiegazione. Non ti scrivo per offenderti ma credo seriamente che sia un modo di offendere chi vive per poter mangiare e dare da mangiare ai propri figli. Se tutto questo ti fa stare bene... Ben venga per te.
U should put a lift kit on it and some mud tires and see if she can go through mud
What t fuck i wish i had it so sad
My anxiety 📈
You think you would be interested in sponsoring a veterans jet ski relief ride group?? Asking for a small group of veteran riders we ride to combat ptsd wd sponsorship would be the most epic!!!

Dude I love you for this! I’ve waited my entire life to see someone anyone drive a “Ferrari” like they can afford it. Nothing like seeing a Ferrari fan boy in a 400k sports car doing 25 in a 20mph zone🍆🫠😂 drive it like you stole it ❤️ it!!!!!

Bro needs to put some 48 inchers on that Thang.
Man, so many people will never be able to afford a car like that and you just trash it. You got dollars but no sense.
Thie hurrican evo car cover over it was the touch it needed lmao

That Ferrari is better than the Porsche Dakar ngl

4:40 names Scruffy. The janitor.
Ferrari pov: Are you fucking kidding me. why'd ya do that. (sarcasm)
Bro just doesn’t care about the fact he is destroying thousands by the second and I love it 😂
Sellout
sad ferrari got a beast owner
I'm a huge car guy, but when it comes to Ferrari, I hate there customer service plus the law Sue's, so if there try taking your Ferrari away, just blow it up lol, shot a tank round at it, don't get me wrong it's a nice car, but still, if they try taking it away, destroy it.
y did you do that to the car
y
this guy playing forza horizon irl

If I didn’t know any better . Id say this was a advertisement for the car bag.
car bubble stocks just sky rocketed 🤣
you are so sick to rui my favorite car existing
This is the only person I know who can handle a lawsuit the size of Ferraris net worth
Ferrari should ask you to use this in commercials 😂😂
just waiting for him to durability test a bugatti

This was BS
Use me as a dislike button👉
I saw the very last part with the bubble all over YouTube  and gifs but no one bothered to show credit on who made it,  Cody great video man.

Gotta say I’m impressed with your driving!
Missed opportunity for not throwing a dildo at the bubble.

Every time Q gives James Bond a new Aston Martin. He completely ignores the 1000 page thick manual with all features and gadgets but returns it back to Q dismantled. This reminds me of that, nice work man 👍

How does this dude make it so easy to hate him 😂😢
Turn it into a rally car

This man is a genius.
13:20 me looking for my 10mm in the tool box
Forza Horizont moment
This is the greatest thing to date 🤣 I guess I care more about an old ford truck worth 5k more than a 400k car.
I for sure find this one amusing.
LMAO at the end !!  😂
This is class 🤣🤣🤣
bro had the cs-go cases
Sad   ,boring , unimaginative video !
😂😂😂😂😂😂 4:41
No i będzie pozew 😂

Glad to see he didn’t actually destroy it 😢
This video is so funny 😂😂
Make more video with Tank is so funny
13:18 Took the saying “Give it all you got” to another level💀
This is great and all but I miss seeing squatted trucks being destroyed:(
good shit
Does the bubble protect it from water and if so, you should push it out onto a lake and see how well it floats
playing forza be like:
Can the bubble/Ferrari combo withstand bullets and/or tannerite? I think the world would like to know.
Glorious to show what a beating it can take. Most won't even see descent speeds on highways.
E sei anche uno sfigato
I don’t see why you would waste a perfectly good car for no reason
The array of shit flying at the end 😂😂
Bet you won’t drop it from a helicopter lol
Since he worked for his dad's construction company, isn't it still daddies money? Lol
Can you drop this car from 10ft and see if it still drives? #goals
A true hate crime against italians. Keep up the great work.
He’s goin soft on us boys he didn’t even pull on the mirror

Did way better than I thought it would
This whole video felt like an ad for the bubble cover at the end
This man's life is just a Forza Horizon game
I love it. Found the Chanel when G63 videos came out and now got another lovely new notification! ... After watching: yepp👍🏻 you all delivered! That force field bubble is awesome fun
Gta in real life 😂
🚨🚨 Ferrari a lot more durable than I thought!!
Just an FYI Cody, the Carcapsule is NOT Fireproof, I found that out in 2021 when my mustang burnt to the ground inside of a car capsule… do with that information what you will.
Well played!
Destroy a Ferrari but not the R8 😠😠
Forza horizon player in real life b like:

Ferrari is trash. Thanks
Why do I feel like i'm watching someone play GTA 5.  I 'm in an airport laughing my ass off!

Been watching since you blew up that blue ford trucks engine up, literally. Glad to see you’ve come this far. You must be making bank bro, your money your rules so I respect all that you do. The hellcat hurt a little but the Ferrari deserves it for their tyrannical corporate. Hope you keep making vids that make us laugh and just having genuine fun in your vids with your friends. Yall seem to enjoy each other. Love ya bro
Does nothing to it.

Ferrari's gonna see this and will 100% sue you for DESTROYING their BEST Ferrari's, this is a way that I go "F@*% YEAH, NOW THIS IS A WAY TO TROLL FERRARI AND THEIR STUPID ASS RULES TO PROPERLY USE THEIR CARS" as I'm laughing of excitement and and humor

Go head and do it i bet you won't do it lol. I am not hating you can do whatever you want to do it it's your own money not mine
My favorite thing about this video is that it's the first thing that pops up when you search "Ferrari" on YouTube. There's no way they haven't seen this. 🤣
Come on Cody we all saw the cars in the back make a video of those
put farming equipment on an expensive car
@4:06 did anyone else think of the pixar lamp before the movie starts lmfao
This dude managed to do what we are all doing in car games ..
Forza Horizon IRL:
It sounds amazing tho
he almost threw everything at it but the kitchen sink :(
8:00 It's like GTA lmao
My guy playing for a irl
I urge you to go look at comments on the road and track article. There are so many hate comments for you it’s hysterical!
he lives Forza everyday lmaooooo
From a car guy that isnt a 5 yr old, idk how anyone could hate on this dude man. Youre doing things i can only dream about, yet the smile on my face is as big as yours watching you do all this stupid shat on any car,truck 😂
They're sending the letter....😂
Diesel would be a good fast and furious driver
All things considered, @whistlindiesel is a great driver.
This is how a ferrari is suppose to be driven
Literally GTA5 in real life

I don’t blame him. I’d try to jump the car over train tracks
Living the need for speed dream
You are number one Cody  the one and only wild crazy !
I’d love to have it to do some more test with it, 🤣 I’d jack it up put in in 6th or 7th or how ever many gears it’s got and give it full power and than let the jack down and see if the clutch holds, or you could see if it will pull annother kind of car, IDK,
video idea, buy an f40 and turn it into a fiero.
I’m cool with smashing jdm boys dreams, but this is starting to go too far.
Ok ok but leave audi dumbass.
funniest video yet.  lol  well done
Due cose sono evidenti in questo video. 1) l'autore ha un micropene 2) Ferrari non gli venderà mai più una delle sue auto.
Bro in between 13:50 and 14:05 seconds sounds like logs getting fired😂😂👍👍👍
Idiot
So this is where that Ferrari bubble video came from! Seen it everywhere, but no one credits the mad man who actually did it!
I can't even afford a train ticket
@whistilndiesel Ferrari mulch in a cup
Are we not going to talk about Lamborghini black cover at start of the video..
I feel like Ferrari when they sue people ruins the reputation more than them just letting it happen
i had never been laughing for this long and this is real crazy knowing i love cars, but i even enjoy more this than seeing them collecting dust in a unit.  LOVE ur vids
Let's lift him and make a off-road vehicles XD
Jeremy Clarkson would be entertained with this.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
i fucking loved this all the way through
I hope Ferrari sues this man
Ur like the American version of taxtherich lol
You just gave that balloon car protector company the best add ever for their product.

Dude, trard
Esti d’epais
What impresses me the most is how well he handled his Scandinavian flicks.
I wonder if the bubble will stop the g wagon from hitting it
I support this message.
Dude's playing forza in real life
Dislike. Title should be "Bought ferrari just to give it to Tim"

Destroy a Tesla
This guy is playing Forza Horizon 5 in real life.🤣🤣🤣
the balloon joke got me
I'm more impressed how much crap was thrown by a few people in less than a minute.
Finally someone that shows to our current culture the reality of those expensive possessions - metal and plastic. Finally someone to show the world how pathetic we are in this cult of material possessions. Shoes for tens of thousands of dollars that the people who are buying them are afraid to walk around in them so not scratch them.. false idols..
Ferrari just paid for its self in 3 days
DITT JÄVLA OLLON :)
Lawsuits coming in hot💀
This man is nuts
You suck I see guys like Dave Sparks or the burger guy who have made a ton of money some where (like you) but they give back to the community and planet while you thow money away while helping nothing or no one. What 400k could do and you think its funny to waste it.
fukin terrified for this car😭
Nah you are actually a legend
Looks like a bunch of spoiled rich kids
Entertaining & unusual.
Gta has ruined us all
Gimme a Hammer
bro just playin forza irl 💀💀
He should drive monster max over it
Best advertising for Ferrari and Chinese Spy Balloon (in clear)!
lmao, r.i.p. 😂
Debil....No coment 💩😠👎👎👎
I live this
Bro is playing forza in real life
Otro niñato de papá gastándose el dinero en tonterias en vez de hacer no se... que se podría hacer con 400.000 dolares? Seguro que en Ucrania, Turquia o Siria lo hubieran aprovechado mejor. Que asco de youtubers. Os ponía a todos a trabajar de verdad.
This guy thinks that he is in gta 7 irl😂😂😂
this guy is insane
These videos never get old
like why bro
I can not express how much I love this channel. Cody you are a legend!
You seem like a spoiled little brat
Forza in real life
Italy is hating you….🇮🇹🍕🍝😡😠🤣
Question is: Why?
Mans playing forza horizon irl 😂
Horrible destruir vehículos de este tipo tan lindos y tan cotizados las concesionarias deberían unirse y radicar una denuncia y demanda ya que son unidades a cuenta gotas y el  valor y lo que cuesta tenerlas para que se compren para dicho fin
These are very sensitive sensors so we have to make sure not to hit anything for the like 10 min it takes to get down the driveway proceeds to hit the gate
GTA vs REAL?? Nope!! GTA=REAL:)
WD knows how to drive
As much as this hurts watching, the rev bomb limits made up for it
The only person with the balls to do this - bravo love to see what these machines can actually handle 😎
Ferrari screaming right now CODYYYYY! Stooooooppp! Cody stop!
Bro I can’t lie this vid made me cringe whenever he was rough with it. I love Ferraris CARS not their corp so I guess thisa win someway
bro is playing forza horizon irl
He should totally build an off road f8
your a wanka mate
Esto es lo que son los youtubers, niñatos consentidos que se creen que todo vale, se quejan de los impuestos que pagan de más pero no les importa pagar ferraris y Lamborghini para fardar o para romperlos.  Basura de gente a la cual deberían de cortarle las emisiones y marcas como Ferrari y Lamborghini entre otros negarse a venderles coches a los come p....as estos.
You have more ladders than a roofing company lol
This shit dead ass as been in my recommended every day so I MIGHT AS WELLL WATCH  Edit: *was not disappointed*
He should try pulling a plow with it or entering a tractor pull
Thank you so much for making this video. Fuck Ferrari and everything they stand for 😊
😂😂😂😂 the end was epic!!!! 😂 next time put it through its paces and rev the hell out of it till the engine blows!!! 🤣
13:16 it just keeps going 😂😂
So far 237k people have got to enjoy a Ferrari
waiting for him to get sued by ferrari, like ferrari always sues ppl who modify their cars in a way they dont like or destroy them.
Put boggers on it!!!!!
I work with a bunch of grown men that will cry if their snap-on tool box gets dust on it. Will you please do a tool box torture test
Only Cody in this world can draw a balls to the Ferrari horse :D
I'm genuinely curious what's in all those boxes in the background. They look like communication equipment we used in the military
Real Life Forza Horizon Experience
What sort of stupid shit is this? You could have helped 1000 people but views are more important....
Gotta say Cody you are pretty clean with the driving man. Take this thing to the sand dunes
I'm waiting for him to fly a F-16 or something
Finally a video to see how durable a Ferrari is. I wonder if Ferrari install trailer hitch. Buy the cheapest camper trailer and put it on the hitch.   I love your videos
That exhaust system is worth more than my car it self haha
Alexandre girard je sais que tes la!
I’ll take it for $50 USD now. Serious offer
Finally someone uses their car for its intended purpose
Lift it and buy big tires
Abused 🤬😌
Dude needs to spend some of that money on his teeth. Looks like he eat tar 4 breakfast
Maybe next time give 400000 to charity
This is me convinced Mr.Beast is secretly funding this channel
I love how he had a lamborghini hurican evo car cover on a ferrari
I know it’s like his job, but this man can frickin drive
test the bubble with the anvil
first word that comes to my mind when you say ferrary is "ban" or "lawsuit"
If anyone at Ferrari reads this I just wanted to say, props to making a car that can really withstand a beating somewhere it’s not even intended to be driven at!
animali
Huking a Nike Air Mag at it would’ve been the icing on the cake at the end 😂
well.. we can use ferrari in rally racing
my mans playing forza IRL
Bro, that hurts me. I have no money and you're destroying this Ferrari.
is it gta6 gameplay?
Sponsored by Greta....
did i miss a gta update? the graphics are insane
i thought that having a heart attack is difficult ... this video made me had one
Obscenely ridiculous. How about using your notoriety to help the less fortunate.
Great content as always.
i think once you buy a car you should be able to do whatever but not advertise it lmao love the vids
Why?
Mr.TaxtheRich1000 vibes, love it
How does he drive with no plate or insurance?
you stupid idiot starzy ci za dużo kasy dali
I have only done this in gta 5
bad video
this guy just made the best commercial for that bubble car protector😂😂🤣🤣
** my guy playng gta 5
Pov: you are playing Forza Horizon 4
Man is really destroying my dream car.. yeye who care destroy it more
You didn't buy it lol it was funded to you
the wall of crates whats in them yo
guys look at the lisins plait at 730m
That’s hurting 😫
ok my jaw dropped and couldn't pick it up til the end
This made me mad sorta
Lol weird how people actually hate on him just shows people really got nothing else to do but hate
Please do Ferrari on Buggy Wheels!  Please!!!!
White people and 1st world problems.... Why not use that money to help someone in need....
People are raging about this in other videos I've seen but I'm happy about it. Ferrari needs to stop overstepping their bounds. Once the customer takes delivery and registers the car in their name, it's theirs to do as they please.
i dont think i can not think about people who starve when i see others playing with expensive toys, im kinda glad you didnt ruin it completely (at least in the video)
Wow, thats a cool fast Sports Car
Thank you
I am so extremely disappointed! How can you have a car like that and not see if it can skip across water? They're called skid plates for a reason duh
beamng drive type beat
Thanks for being yku man this video killed me
I fuckin love it
Is nobody gonna talk about his drifting skills
Like watching GTA in real life lol 😂😂😆 damn would be an amazing completely done up off road race car
I loved watching your old stuff.  Now a days it’s all about “fuck ya, look how much money I can spend, you mafffakaaaz”.    Be happy with your dollars. I‘m out (still watching the good old stuff). 🫡
😄🔥💪
Guys, Im trying to figure out which one of Cody's videos are best.  Which one do you laugh the hardest at?
Fun fun fun! But i'm really worried for the Icon FJ in the background.  I know this will not help but: please don't.
GTA in real life
Cody, I Love your videos they make me laugh so much and they make me feel great.
This is how I drive a sports car in Gta 5
If I was the Ferrari bubble maker I would just put a picture of Cody on the wall with the caption 'salesman of the century' at the corporate headquarters.
Bro sliding rocks on that car😳 Ik it’s a video but he’s living life, no one is doing that🤔 😵‍💫
You forgot the kitchen sink
Fuck Ferrari 🤣
The first word that comes is sue
I fucking love this guy
you are crazy love it
please do ferrari vs the sinkhole
shoot it with the 50cal
I was waiting for a round to go through the window at the end 😂
You won’t destroy Bugatti
loved it
playing forza IRL
This is art.
Lovely cars, but I hate Ferrari as a company, their arrogance disgusts me. Imagine spending a good 6 figures on a car, and they have the nerve to tell you what you can and can't do with it.
... Plz car
CODY YOU GETTING SOFT!!
Dude is literally looking for barn finds in Forza Horizon IRL
andrew tate couldnt even touch this man, with the "driving my bugati offroad video."😂
Real life FORZA Horizon starring WhistlingDiesel 😂🔥💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽

I was mad about hurting the hilux, this made up for all that
I just think you’re an idiot all that money try helping needy people.. kids go hungry every day!!
im in love with that tune😍😂😂
Next video: "I decided to give away 1milion to people who  need money to survive- making myself a better person" 🤞
love it
When you finish this test give it to me for free if you don t need it, i will wait
I like that he was more happy when he got the blue sema but when he gets a Ferrari he is normal 😂😂
Cody has pissed off every community but the banshee community. Please buy a banshee. 🥹
HHAAAAAAAHHHAAA OMG i am ded
GOTTA LOVE THIS, just be careful about Ferrari they will SUE… if you mod it
Okay that bubble is seriously impressive
It Would be great if Ferrari commented
U should buy a ram trx
next time grab a koenigsegg jesko or a school bus and play like rocket league irl
If hurts
It's like he is playing GTA and Faming Simulator at the same time.
Was totally expecting a kitchen sink to be thrown at it last.
The Lamborghini cover blanket 😂😂😂
So this is what you do with cars. I guess it's because you can't drive them. I wonder if you do the same with girls... or whatever you prefer...
Mark McCann would be proud 👏
He literally didn’t do anything to the car, any damages would be minor
waste of money if youre gna do  that imo
I thought from the comments i read before the end that the bubble test was actually blowing bubbles with the front air scoop rofl
Literally playing forza horizon in Tennessee 😂
What ???? No kitchen sink, that's sus. But fun watch tho !!!
WHAT'S THE BENEFIT FOR LIEING?.
😮Bro is playing GTA V in real life 😂
Cringe lol
This is Forza in real life haha
Fuck this gold, i'm trully happy to be alive at this point in history <3
When its on mud you see it gross and stuff for me i see it ass the badest farrari of all time this how its **should**be used like.
😂😂😂😂😂
Ferrari is finna come to you in your dreams😂
Next hoovie
👍
I always disliked this guy, now I definitely hate him
Im not even least bit mad because its just a pretty new mass produced not so special car. If you did this to a F40 then I'd need your address info ASAP 🤫
This is Daily Driven Exotics Demolition 😂😂
Forza horizon 5’s most talented stunt driver
bro is literally playing forza horizon irl
Man was just playing Forza in real life just ripping it down the dirt road. Something you know everybody dreams of in a car like this
This guy
The bubble company will ask for the video as an advertisement 😂
it look like a pub for ferrari
Ferrari has the most beautiful cars
05:44 that guy sitting in background his jaw felled off after seeing him on top of ferrari
wow this is the first video that got me angry on YouTube. How does this guy not have a single cell in his body that seems to care about these cars! Just unrespectfull!!!!!
Fuck man this hurts but he deserves it
The radar detector on the front windshield made me laugh outloud
You are a total idiot!
Normally I really enjoy watching Cody destroy vehicles..  But this is the first time I had heart burn and anxiety watching a video.  Oh well.  Not my money!
For Pete’s sake! There are starving kids in Africa!
Where is the link to buy that China balloon?
Every other Ferrari owners,, looks how nice my Ferrari looks parked inside my garage for the rest of its life, meanwhile this Ferrari is have the best of its life..
keller stressing the whole time is a vibe
your average gta player
I think we found “how to basic” 😂
I feel like it would look good with Bull horns 😏😏
forza oynuyor sanki anasını satim
Here's an epic idea, rally Ferrari
This reminds me of when I was playing fh4
goodness this guy is the leader of the cringe army.
I could of watched a full hour of this
L video L creator
u are nuts man hahaahah
Every time I see these I say to myself “wow you’ve got to be shitting me why would anyone do stuff like this!!” But then I look down and realize I’ve watched the whole video and there’s 3.5 million views. I don’t know if that pays for a Ferrari but If it does then I suppose I would do it too. I would like to see that thing go top speed off of a cliff of some sort and crash into the other side. Maybe the Grand Canyon?
Next is the lambo suv vs the Porsche suv vs the g wagon just wait folks then the lifted lambo car just wait folks
ferrari has luck
I wish I knew what it was like to spend 400k on something to destroy
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
He is just playing forza horizon in real life
Happiest Ferrari on the planet
this shit is actually funny
Idiot
I'm kinda mad nobody threw a kitchen sink in that last clip.
What do you do with these destroyed cars?
lemme have it i’ll come pick it up😩😩
It's great to see people flipping the bird to Ferraris arrogant and primitive business model
Bro is playing GTA in real life
Do a Tesla
cringe.
ugh
RIP Ferrari lovers
You are an idiot. But someone has to be one. I kind of envy you :)
Can you please do something with the Volkswagen Beetle pretty sure you can find diesel one and Red😂
9:20 this dude playing forza irl looking for a barnfind lol
One of the best YouTubers on the platform! No overly cringeness like all these bloggers and Mrbeast. This dude is straight or the point and has fun without caring about what we think 💯
From hellcats to raris 🥷🏿
This is one of those special videos where you find yourself cancelling your subscription.  This isn't fun any more, WD.
Lol yo he threw everything at the end
This is my ideal job
best video you've made up to this point!!!
I don’t care bout the cars being treated that way but you gotta admit it sounds amazing
This guy is playing forza horizon in real life, lucky bastard
Bro just became the #1 salesman for that car bubble company
I love this
If Ferrari sues you for messing with their car, why not mess with it in ANY way - imagine getting sued for ONLY a logo swap. Just destroy the thing, one lawsuit is one lawsuit xD
Freaking LEGEND!
I'm too poor to watch this
Yo, this was a super convincing ad to get one of those air bubbles for my car. I'm sold on it
holy man, masterpiece of a vid!
The ending when they start throwing tools😂😂😂
such a idiot
Guy's playing Forza IRL :D
Man, the timing on this video, I've been holding a grudge against Ferrari over this crap for so long, and even though I can't come close to affording one, I can now live vicariously through your vendetta as if it's my own. 🫡 I salute you in your battles, good sir.
Can I just say we all wanted to see this done with a Ferrari. Whistling diesel is the one to do it!
this man just destroyed a car worth half of my working life... ANOTHER COMMON W FROM WHISTLINDIESEL
pure bullshit! 👎👎
The first world that I come into my mind when I see this dude is Child
Can I have this car?
Buy a pistenbully 600 polar
IF ITS RED ITS DEAD!!!!!!!
Wow pow pow exhaust feeling :)🍿
Get an Mitsubishi lancer evo
I..luv…it
He is playing forza IRL
how do you treat the car? you shouldn't be sued, the mafia should take care of you.
bro offroaded it like it was Forza
An idiot with money….
The bubble part  got me dead love it 😂❤
Drop an anvil on the bubble
Ken Block deff would have been proud🤙🏾thank you for this legendary content.

That’s my dream car but do we care no because he lets me know if it’s a good care I love youu your my fav yourtuber♾️♾️💪💪
Great advertising for the bubble thing ig
Rally rarri for the w

Man plays FH6 😊
Balls of steel 🔥🔥
You just gotta love Cody and his Looney Tunes approach to reviewing quality merchandise..!
Bro needed that tax right off 💀🫡🔥
dude i just liked and subed cause i will feel bad if u cant make the money u spend fr
Serious question. How many guys did you have throwing shit at the car while it was in the balloon. I’ve yet to see a tornado yeet that much crap in such a short amount of time.
bro basically said fuck you to Ferrari
Don't worry folks. The car is ceramic coated.
Top notch advertising for that car bubble. Hope they paid you
How do you get the money 💰 🤑 💸 for that car
Idk why but him driving in the mud and rain made me wanna buy one so I can do something like that!
You are my most favorite YouTuber
any% speed run of getting sued
Treats his car like shit. Disgusting
but can you even shoot on it ?
You promised destruction! Car is hardly destroyed! I was hoping to see red bits everywhere!
He’s spent more on his last two videos than I’ve made my whole life lol savage
This is like playing Forza Horizon when trying to go offroad with a super car HAHAHA
Let me re-phrase the title of this video "I am a cunt"
Safe to say the bubble gets the job!
5:49 That was fucking perfect. Every supercar should be driven like this.  9:40 - 10:14 was pretty damn good too.
F the Ferrari how many ladders does this man own.   Lmfao.
That man is crazy 😂
We need a part 2
Sounds like a sled lmao
Im impressed with the ferrraris perfomance..  it eld up much better than i thouhgt
Cease and desist on the way
Bro like how do you have so much money that you are latterly destroying a ferrari. Like bro if you have so much money then gift me a gaming setup
Bros living Forza 😭
Bro!!! You should buy a Patek Phillipe or RM next 😂😂 and do the whistlindiesel treatment 💥
Yea Guarantee that Cooperate is going To Flip thr balls into a Beaver 🦫 and ,Make a wanted unwanted Poster of Your FACE THAT IT COULD FIT a Goodyear Blimp....... Uuuuuuu Huh
☝️🤭 Can you use your Money Power make the Earth Clean…..Zero Trash..
Forza Horizon IRL
Yes 👍🏿
WD would be awesome if you came to check out our farm were a non profit here in Florida if you ever want to donate we use just about anything here :) love your content
This is how you get blacklisted from Ferrari
bro you drive soo goood
tax the rich vibes
Maybe I missed it but I think this was an advertisement for the bubble.
I hope Ferrari bans you
Watching the video before it gets put down.
buy chiron
Bros got a radar detector
Hopefully Ferrari wakes up and realizes we buy stuff to be ours. Sure it's a lie and they can take your shit in a min, but getting sued over what you do with your car is menacing nonsense.
Imagine doing that to give away to one of your subscribers? Can you ?
Petition for Whistlin Diesel to make car reviews.. this video proves that ferarris can do anything.. i hope you dont get sued lmao
I have respect for Cody but I just don't care for whistlin diesel anymore...
Ferrari should be calling soon……. Even though I think this video will boost their sales
Bro wants a law suit
Absolute LEGEND!
bro playin' forza irl
The last bit is a good way to sponsor that protection bubble
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 that is some great entertainment right there, we’ll done gents.
Can I have the car.please
Like watching a train crash, but smiling the entire time, without people dying, while at work on my computer, wishing I could be in the passenger seat, but again, not dying along the way.  One of the best yet!!
Honestly that bubble company should hit you up and just use that genuinely as an ad LOL
Fuck the 458
This guy plays BeamNG in real life
Thats how i usually play forza horizon
fastest way to get banned from ferrari
This man is really playing GTA Online bro
Imagine being so rich that u destroy expensive stuff for fun 😆
I love you guys but, this one hurt to watch a little 🥲 keep up the good work 🥲
I enjoyed this alittle too much
Ferrari is about to enter  wrc after seeing this. Awesome video!
"built ferrari tough" should be the new slogan lol
Forza horizon 6
Judge:- so whistlin Diesel is sentenced to death for drawing a pp in the ferrari logo.
When are Ferrari gonna sue you?
DDE IS CRYING RIGHT NOW….
This video hurts my heart….
Great advertising 😄
Epic
like where does the money  come from? its fucking nuts lol
Hand me a hammer *throws the whole shop at the bubble*
And why don't you spend that money helping those in need instead of using it on stupid things? that's why I'll never waste time watching garbage content like this.
Ok, hear me out. Maybe, just maybe, giving it away to some random viewer will get you more clicks than destroying such a beautiful car. Regardless of self-praised Ferrari policy.
It would be better if you had some drone following you
u using ferrari like they used it long ago (tracktor)
Ferrari is tough.
is like the video with the guy that did the same with a RR
If Ferrari hill climbs don’t become a thing, I’ll be very disappointed.
We need a video on the RzR Pro R, see if it survives the durability test
😂😂😂😂😂
Man oh man. This channel is way to stupid for me and it shows how many dummies are out there scary
💀👨‍🦯
Hello sir this is farrari to inform you that you have been BLACK LISTED.
Bro got GTA6 early. LOL
I work at Lowe’s if you need more buckets I got you with the discount
“gUnNer gEt sUeD fOr tHe LaMbO cOVer”
I liked it before I watched it lol
Bros trying so hard to get sued by Ferrari but it’s so awesome plus if I had a manufacturer I wouldn’t care how people modified my cars and I’d probably condemn them.
That could made my whole life
Honestly I’ll never get how people can be mad at Cody destroying his cars, he’s made the money to buy them he has every right to do with them as he pleases.
Тhis should be shown in theaters, i was more excited to watch this ,than "Avatar: The Way of Water"
My guy is playing GTA irl.
Drive the battle tank over it
God damn that's a nice car
Crazy  shi.... hahaha
i dont understand why anyone cares to watch some rich youtuber wreck nice shit.
As a Ferrari owner myself, I approve this message.
9:03 now we know why Ferrari doesn't let anyone who buys the car use it properly, in 5 minutes of use it's already full of codes to clear lol.  Great video dude, I absolutely loved the video, hope to see Ferrari boiling by now🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ford GT durability test next please!!!!!!!
Moron
Dobre😂chyba w salonie ferrari nie masz już czego szukać😀
Кайф) Хочу і собі так !) Хто може дати Ferrari на огляд ?)))

This is torture
Platinum

Hurts a lot 😭😭🥺🥲
Shit reminds me of how I play forza
What if the balloon company Sued you😂
Man... what I'd give to come slide around in the dirt with yall. More than I should honestly.
Pierdolony frajer 😆😆😆
BEWARE OF SCAMMERS APPEARING TO BE CODY DETWILER GIVEAWAY, AND ASKING FOR $400 TO BE SENT TO CASHAPP OR SOME CRAP BEFORE SENDING THE TRUCK YOU "WON"
this hurts
Nope.  Why?
this is the best video on youtube
full of money and don't translate this shit into Portuguese 👍😳🇧🇷😂
Streetspeed717 is trying so hard to be like you

Congrats on being banned from Ferrari you're on top1%
u speed up the natural process  its natural
Hear me out 4x4, lifted, and massive tires
Haven't finished the video yet, but if this car survives at all... please jack it up what's left of it, cut up the fenders for bigger tires, plaster with sponsor decals, and make this into a ferrari rally car??
secretly this is his favorite car🤫
I love this!  Next, can't wait to go through the comments deriding you for destroying this near useless car :D
The traction system on the ferrari is top notch, very impressive driving too.
ive never seen a ferrari lose its virginity to a fiji water bottle, until now
Forza Horizon IRL
I am literarily crying man :( .
That was so hard to watch😂😂😂😂
Yeah that looks good...looks like a brick... :} lmao
probably should get that thing rally tires, suspension and awd
didnt know ferrari had a rally car
Must be amazing to have that sort of money to just be able to destroy things
calling a 458, my dream car, cheap🥴🥴
It’s a shame people with money do this instead of just give the stuff the we’re going to destroy to someone that actually needs it.
He's the type of youtuber from whom you can expect videos like "testing an atomic bomb."
He went a little to soft on this Ferrari, you are losing your touch WD 😢
This video hurts to watch
Bro and i’m scared to drive my v6 charger over a speed bump 🤦🏽‍♂️
Forza Horizon irl
This is real life forza lol
pov you play gta
Real life forza 😂
What an idiot
Day 1 of asking you to destroy a tesla.
This man makes all our childhood dreams come tru
I don't know if anybody has had this much fun in a Ferrari since TaxtheRich100.
I wanted so badly for him to walk up with a 12 gauge and put one through the bubble and the window of that Ferrari. Step it up!
He really added gunshots to the end part
You and streetspeed would have a blast
Wow.
you fucking crazy🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Make a 4x4 lifted one next n jump it
13:18 I lost my shit and died lmao hahahah
Ngl I expected more of you😭
Off roading in a ferrari reminds me of what I do in forza.
Ferrari its not for everyone.
I love cars and all but the ferrari mentality is some shit with these lawsuits.  I'd love to see you destroy this car. I hope them for some good pain in ass. 🤌🤌🤌
Bro you just amazing Love from India
this wut i drive like in forza fr
I see a 911 in the backround. I cant waitttt for the demo of that car
Probably the dumbest video ever seen. Cheers from Italy
Atleast it's just a ferrari. Under a Lamborghini cover
How about  giving me a $30K loan and forgiving 25k of it because someone really needs it vs waisting it.
There is a lamborghini huracan cover on beginning on the ferrari haha
Watching the car go throught all sorts a shite hurts but is also very satisfying
who comes after seeing this on social media like me 😉😁
I bet that sponsored by Lamborghini
I dont think this is how you are supposed to play forza
Seems like it took everything you could throw at it!
😂😂😂😂😂 crazy guys 👍🏻
Es su coche lo ha comprado pues puede hacer lo que quiera un coche es para disfrutarlo no tenerlo en la cochera para los domingos si se rompe algo pues lo arreglará y dónde está el problema
🤦‍♂️
Wasting money like that reminds me of our current government.
This video is makes that bubble product owner rich! Now I am looking for one for my Muscle car.
should try it with an F40........
The Secret Ferrari advert they don't want you to know about! shows the durability and the power that the car really has
i wont be surprised if ferrari sued cody you know ferrari is ferrari
Over priced Volkswagen
Legit like watching him play GTA V in real life while driving through the hills and grass in a super car LOL
Its heartbreaking seeing this but someone had to do it
Hey 3 days in, any lawsuits? Bery nice bubble!
bro is playing forza💀💀💀💀💀💀
Dude. You should enter a gravel rally in the thing.
I Would love to be friends with you.
Where do you sign up to sell your soul?
You should get pod put on it and durability test it
They are in a meeting watching this right now 😂 love these videos!
Esse cara é doente kkkkkjdhh
We all secretly know 1 day with him would be the best day of our lives dudes the true definition of legitness
There should two Youtubes: One for educated people who can actually  read and think…and another for cat videos, teenagers filming themselves drunk…and THIS kind of stupidity.
And where is destroying actually?
ahh what a beautiful moment, i have every day similar dream to wake up and rip some car at woods but since you are doing it for me aint have to do it :P
why tf does it have a lambo cover wtf
One big commercial for the car bubble 😝😂
Wrap it the general lee and see how offended ferrari gets from it being wrapped that and the confederate flag
You didn't do shit to it omg not some dirt & mud 🤦‍♂️  kill it with fire or blow it up!
So they are youtubers who spend their money to cure blind people and other to destroy Ferraris just for views. Cool!
Bros playing Forza Horizon in real life
I'm on my way to making content like this guy but it's going to be something completely different on a much higher level no one has ever seen before. Watch out MrBeast. I coming for you next! NO VIDEOS YET!
@WhistlinDiesel i’ll buy it off you for 10$
Best Ferrari ad

My man accidentally made the greatest Ferrari ad of all time
Sai mona

What a loser you must be to do this.. You destroyed something worth 400K just to be the Flextuber you are, like anyone with a life actually gives a fuck that your a spoiled little rich suburban kid who gets to destroy things worth almost half a million.
Bro played forza IRL At 5:50 💀
Free advertisement for that bubble
oh man that was good
This is literally the best way to get subscribers. I LOVE IT!
this is fuck you money.
Switched the letters on the hood of my beat up Jeep Liberty to Deep 😎
ferrari gonna get cancer after seeing that 😂💀
If it was an older ferrari from back when they actually looked good i would have cried watching this. I think newer ones that look the same as every other modern supercar are more entertaining to watch driven like this than on a racetrack.
Bahhahahahaha ferrari
Man's playing forza in real life
Boot Catch Bottom left 13:44
People with to much money & no brains kind of annoy me I don’t like these cars but only people with to much money & no brains would ruin a car like this & why would a car company go after people who did whatever they want to a vehicle they paid for that in it’s self sounds dumb if a person has purchased something that means they own it & can do whatever they like to it  😂
WhistlinDiesel Hi, I have a tip for you. Try buying an armored car. And destroy him. Good luck, I enjoy your videos.
Waiting for rolls royce
Never laughed so hard during an anxiety attack 🙆🏽‍♂️🤣🤣
13:54 - Yellow ladder hit it lmao
😄🤣🤣what did ferrari do to this young man?
Forza IRL
This is so disturbing
Throw the anvil at it.
Forza hahah
🤣👍💪  beat it
Bet next on the list is gonna be a Bugatti
"Unfortunately *throws exhaust off table* WE DO NOT CARE" LMAOOOO golden
How can you afford 400K car with 500K yearly income? Youve made 4M so far thats 1/8 of your total income.
get ready to be sued
Best driver
I hated his vids when I first saw them but man this was absolutely hilarious! I love cars! and this would have had me crying like I’m sure some people were lol but man I wish I could do that with that car lol looks like an absolutely blast
It's real life forza
This reminds me of when I lose control and go off road in gta 5
i usually dont like these videos but when he was asking for a hammer and got the workshop i was crying!
I doubt Ferrari really care to be honest, they just want you to buy it 😂😂
There is no Ferrari owners ever exists  The people who got a Ferrari are just rent them from the company Even if you tint you're car tha company will get the car from you at any cost even if you are Floyd maywather  No refunds available
*** Buy Goonsquadz Ferrari and see how it holds up after it was rebuilt !!!! ***
These videos are direct reflection on his mental capacity to be an adult.
This is litterally Forza Horizon 5 irl
Taxtherich legacy
Dude ima have a brain aneurysm watching this video!  But you’ve got me hooked now I have to watch the entire thing!. 😏🙄🤦🏼‍♂️
Gawwwwwwd.
I wonder how many of us are ordering a bubble for storing our Ferrari's lol
10:25 😂😂
the tune on this car is sick the sound is amezing
Im working a fulltime job, barely able to make it thru the week, living in a van. I liked his vids till he started doing this stuff. If ur gonna waste money then why not send 10k twards pple in my situation. Pple who actualy try to do something with thier life

Pitticcu su tontu.. 🤬🤦
I’m glad he didn’t actually destroy the car ! That’s a nice ride !!!!
After it’s destroyed take it to a fancy restaurant.
You could’ve just give it to me for free 😢
dudes playing forza horizon irl
El capitalismo maltratando al capitalismo...
Another stupid boring video
This is great, a beautiful masterpiece in the works
"Mafioso hit squad inbound"
this is the content I am here for.
That thing dont have a scratch boy
gotta say this video was most beautiful thing i've ever seen
Totalny idiot!
Buy chiron to destroy it then you gon be a most famous person in the world for a while
They threw their entire inventory
This made my day! 😊 🎉thank you
Link for the Air Bubble protection for the car please
definition of you have more money than f*cks to give 💀
What Cody is doing here is gods work.
Bro ur the goat
My expectation of Ferrari durability/reliability has been exceeded😂
янкі навіщо ти форму надів клоун, приїжджай до нас у Бахмут
When you play to much forza horizon
Living in a forza game caught in 4k
That was a great video outro, was hoping you would burst Ferrari's bubble though, pun intended. 😁
Posting a referral link to the bubble shield would easily offset any legal costs 😂
Mira que hay gente engreída como es este elemento
bro is crazy is just an W
This is what Ferrari's were designed for
Gta in real life 😂
The end was just Golden 😭😭😭♥️♥️♥️
Why dont you give it to someone instead of destroying it?
Ferrari is going to have a fucking field day 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ahhh kids with too much money these days....
The funny thing is very good advertising for Ferrari I always want one now I want one even more lol
well your an idiot. not watching...just telling
Got a great idea for next time: just give me the car before you wreck it🤗😂
Man. You’ve gone soft…. When are you straightpiping the thing and slamming the doors 1000 times?
The most impressive thing for me is how well he handled his Scandinavian flicks.
u 🤡
Am envisioning Tavarish or Mat Armstrong buying and repairing whatever broken husk is still left of this car in 6 months.
Idiot!
can’t lie bro is a great driver
I thought I would only see that in forza but who knew, im seeing it as real as it gets🥺
This hurt me
Real life GTA 😂
I hate this dude already 😅
I can’t watch this 🫣
i have money to spend, i will use the car
God bless you!  When I looked up the definition of savage all it said was WhistlinDiesel.  :D
I really enjoy cars. And taking care of them. But I love this. I’d never be able to afford one of these. So seeing you do this brings me joy. I’ve always wondered what it would be like to take a super car off road like I used to do in forza horizon. Your content never fails.
Why on earth..... Sorry but that is just WRONG... For us regular pepole that has a lifelong dream of Owning one & taking care of one, this is just sad. Why on earth would you even do that 😮😮😡😡
Car companies should let these guys do durability tests on there vehicles
Nahh this needs custom rims and liberty walk bodykits
Idiot -.-
Now that's one meerican idiot
Nothing new , this how my uncle drive his Ferrari in Ciudad Juarez  🇲🇽
It's surprisingly durable 😂
This dude is nuts 😂
bro plays forza horizon IRL
I love how he doesn’t give a sh*t about doing damage to expensive things.  I couldn’t do it!
Y would u destroy it better things to do then that obviously u can’t handle It
Whats the point of a ferrari if you cant use it how you want? You paid for it, or do they dont like money?
You need to be careful driving — just like there was Bubba and the water police … I’m sure the gravel police will be after you soon for excessive splashing of gravel!!  BE WARNED, THEY ARE WATCHING!! 😮
Alot of hammers
Just why tho
can i have leftovers from that ferrari? :P
GTA V in real like be like:
how I play forza
Bro is definitely getting that cease and desist
fuck ferrari
Ls swap it..
12:32 you're welcome guys
lamborghini cover on ferrari xdd
Peoples dream cars and he just fucks em up 😂
can’t even blame him for this video, ferrari does get annoying for their lawsuits like hows it fair they can tell someone who literally buys the car what they can and can’t do😐
You should frame the cease and desist letter!😂
I love it when he just treats the cars like his trucks
Love it
Just like that one dude who drove his F40 like a rally car. I love it
Tax the rich is much more interesting  Let's see you doing this in enzo f40 f 50 LaF or 250 gto
So when are we gonna see jars of Ferrari mulch?
So GTA was Right!!!!! Supercars do drive good offroad 🤔🤔🤔🤔
Give some Respect U have too much of money to waste U don't know the value of money use it properly
looooool
Subnormal!
When you are low spirited, and all you have to show for it is money, you destroy something that some people created with effort and inspiration.
You're an enormous idiot...
Hope fully he will not get sued by ferrari
the sheer amount of joy that this video has provided me, i am deeply grateful 🔨🚗
I’m very happy you did the thing you did
So stupid. Ur such a fool.
Good job bro,there are a lot of haters that will hate,but we all know that we all want to do the things you are doing,when I'm watching your vids ,its like watching some of my dreams come true!!! Continue with the good job and with all the demolition.Greetings from Bulgaria 🇧🇬 👏
13:54 yellow ladder def did some dmg haha
When’s he gonna rally it
*First thing that comes to mind when you here Ferrari* problems, issues, humpty dumptys up on a wall tellin ya what you can and can’t do to the vehicle you bought😭
Gotta say he’s a pretty good driver
You said you would destroy it
Man U r crazy we like it,keep doing red necks shit😂
Seeing the thumbnail of this video I thought you were going to crush it with your knee you thanks but this was was new you actually didn't destroyed covered in a big bubble
Ban this Guy
In principle I find it sad to destroy a really exotic car.. but in this case.. Ferrari and their snobbery are  really asking to be ripped.. and knowing that, this was poetic justice.. WD and Ferrari should become a South Park episode
Shame.... che stronso... Why couldnt he use a Ford GT or a PInto.... Or some crappy English car... They Deserve it (If he could get it started)
That's a good video!
Its like GTA in real life :D
So have you been sued yet?
kids in africa could have eaten that ferrari
Lmao. What an ending
Hell yeah😂
buy a ferrari and get a law suit for free👌
This totally needs a lift kit and monster truck wheels))))))))))))
Hey bro🎉
I can't stop crying, help me 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is so much better than channels with millions of subs polishing their precious cars daily while ruining garbage on their channel to gain more subs. Our Bro WD here keeps it real...
Impressive.
Some ppl watching that could never afford one. While he destroys one send me what's left to Scotland
make a lifted rari
you might as well give me the car
Destroy an armoured car
YOU NEED TO DESTROY AN ARMORED VEHICLE!!!!
As an old dude watching this vid, I'm LOVIN' the @TaxTheRich vibes 🥳
Is that your lambo there ?
Best Ferrari commercial I’ve ever seen.
I love these videos, man. I appreciate all the jokes, shots, the editing style, and just the little things too. I'm smiling and laughing throughout the whole thing.
This is why I don’t import cars from America. Shame on you
Ferrari might surprise you and offer you a job, instead of a cease and desist letter.  You might end up with the job this guy had... Testing Ferrari's to destruction.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2iIcrO9NYI
I would do the same thing
I've always wanted to personally diesel swap a Ferrari some how some way preference Cummins if money wasn't a issue in my life & when got the cease & desist order to carry on in my life with my car I applaud your bravery fu#$ Ferrari's stipulations
From trucks to supercars hahaha total G
Si ce débile l'avait payé. C'est certain qu'il ne ferait pas ça  Monde de merde
Truly you are amazing testing or destroy the any car that's great I really like your videos love from Pakistan
This dude just did the best advertisement for that car bubble 😂
So when ferrari tries to sue you, do they actually win, does it actually stand up in court? And can they take your car away and shit like that?
BUY a TRX and destroy it
This is a wholesome funny video 🤣 keep it up 👏❤
If anything ferrari shud be happy for wd testing its durability. Cause theyre notorious for breakin down anyway. Heck, they shud throw him another one for WD approved mcap test
Damn that balloon is tougher thin a cyber truck window.
do you think that ferrari will float?😏
Forza horizon be like:
For me the rear end of the Ferrari reminds me of a mclaren
Bro you drive like me in forza😂
This guy is one of the only ones who inspire me to get rich af just to do shit like this. Off-roading a Ferrari on a muddy track when it's raining!!! Man, I want to be rich enough just to do that and not give single care.
This is probably the best commercial ever for that inflatable car protection system ha.  Pretty impressed
can i have one of those big storage boxes in your garage? idc what one
I honestly dont understand how you have haters, this is just funny. If you've got money to spend then why not right?
You should be receiving a bigger check from the protection bubble company than the Ferrari costed! It made me wanted one of those bubbles as soon as you dropped the stairs on it. Even more after a shitload of crap thrown at it!
So disrespectful to the brand you are a joke bro
This is art.
Bro i did not know he would go this far but what if he destroyed a bugatti?hahahahahahaha
Wow this is what the algorithm has brought me too 😂
Must be the most funny car video ever made 😂😂
a ferrari with lamborghini cover, nice.
Red to use it for Cleetus spectator drags
Having the bubble test go for way too long in the last clip was seriously genius, it made my day and was hilarious 😂
Ferrari gonna have a field day with y’all 😂
Looked like he was climbing mt.chiliad in gta5
What’s stacked behind it at end?
bro is literally playing gta
اخخخ يا راسي 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯 الفلوس ما تطيح الا عند السبايك
That bubble is insane
Imagine some people are literally dying of starvation and this guy does this kind of stuff with super expensive cars.
I love this video I wish yall would of went more ham on that p.o.s and totally destroyed it then I'll subscribe
You probably won’t see this but I’ve got a Chevy dully idk if you wanna trade for it but let me know
I'm more interested in how this kid affords a $400,000 car 🚗 🤔
He just created the best advertisement for that blow up tent
This can happen in forza only
this is the most realistic version of forza i have ever seen
I haven't seen a click bait video like this since Morgz
Do you enjoy being stupid?
See how well it holds up to 50 BMG shots.
That car would be banned me thinks from the town of Chillingbourne. ⛔⛔⛔⛔⛔
This seems so fun sadly I can only do it in Forza
No, you actually bought it to make a video and recover your investment with it!
Hello
he nearly damaged it in the end so wtf?
Ferrari vs civic durability test
Wd please destroy a 7.3 excursion
Can I have it
That was such a good advertisement for that bubble lol
Most of us will never be able to afford a house, much less a fucking Ferrari. And you're just destroying one? Grow up. 🙄 That's not even funny.
lol the shit raining down on the ferrari in the bubble @13:30 made me lose it.  thats funny shit lmao
And the internet’s new favourite gif was born
I wanna buy a Ferrari like nun
Livin in FH5 and GTA 😂
where is the 'destroy' part?
I honestly can't believe that there are still halftard cucks doubting you.
Lmfao donuts all in the mud with a fucking supercar. You guys are killing it, but one question, baby Jesus how many ladders do you have???
Are we not going to talk about him making the main page of google
A bit like Tax the rich. Tax the hicks
Yet here I am, still homeless and drowning in debt and multiple car problems, begging the world for help, to no avail.
At home paint job plzzzzz
Man is playing Forza Horizon In Real Life
my guy paid $400,000 to play forza horizon
Hey whistle,me seeing u mess that Ferrari like that…..breaks my heart….why?because i drive a 2010 camry and i would want that car,but me being ur big fan….U IS One B.M.F💪💯🔥🤙🤙🤙🤙i love ur videos ma guy,come to Grand Rapids one day:’)I would love to meet ur crazy ahhh
So what planet did it get destroyed???
I wouldnt do a quarter of what he did to my Toyota Aqua.
I love Cody so much, but I also really fucking hate him.
Probably get a feature with Ferrari for your free durability test while keeping with their likeness and branding. This is a plus for them. Put a wrap on it and new rims that’s how you get sued
forza IRL😂
This video is literally better than any review or commercial
U r blacklistet
I like how it’s a montage of throwing shit at it then the video just stops 😂
pov forza 5
He needs to destroy a turo rental
What comes to mind when I say Ferrari a rich assholes that doesn't want to have fun with this car LOL  But this is someone that always has fun with his Vehicles R32😆 and red is dead
class A idiot ..... Nice
Why don't u buy a Laferrari or Enzo and wreck it u attention seeking spoiled brat. F8 aint special enough. Ferrari won't notice u.
@dailydrivenexotics you guys have to collaborate with @whistlindiesel
Lmaoooooo 😂 great content!
I always had respect for whistlin, but this video really made me love the guy
Bro playing gta in real life
1st video I watched. Subscribed. Nuff said.
Instead of making a video like this you should’ve bought the car and entered it into a rallying event and make a video doing the the test there
Jus playing forza Fr
does actually seem like a good sports car tho
Do McLaren, Lamborghini and Porsche now
If the company that makes that protective balloon doesn't pay you to use the footage of things getting chucked at it for an ad, they're missing a great opportunity.
Gunshots fired gunshots fired
Who remembers TaxThe Rich videos ? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1VPIV9CsY&ab_channel=TaxTheRich100
The brand deals that are just dripping off of you
God this man will durability test himself someday,,,.......... anyway love from Nepal..............
as hes talking about lawsuits lambo cover on the rarri
Build a pool you can drive in, seal the body minus the driver side window (to get in) waterproof silicone all the wiring terminals around the ecu/body module/ignition, add a long as snorkel, then drive it under water!!!
so thats what an extended warranty looks like
POV: Its me when I play Forza Horizon
we know about cgi you cannot full us
Didn't it got deleted and them re uploaded?
This shit is just forza. Prove me wrong
4:12 the Supra💀
It surely can take a beating !
Amazing
Fake Flex: I Bought A Ferrari Real Flex: I Bought A Ferrari Just To Break It  Amazing Video!!!!!
This is the sign of a nation in decline, the pornography of useless shameless destruction, making it cool to value absolutely nothing.
With  all of that Carbon  does that mean  it  can  go a 1000 feet higher than the hilux  did
@ 7:55 looks like forza horizon
That China spy bellow comment had me weakkk
I love how he went from only having enough to buy used trucks off the internet to being able to buy a Ferrari. I bet he never expected this to happen from all he’s done
What a great waste you utter bellend.
That bubble is a Nokia worthy opponent
After rallying the car and driving it threw the woods the paint honestly still looks pristine.
Fuck the Fezza, but that 400K could have been spend to help people. Anywhere.   Just wasteful
Honestly how nice does that sound and lmfao look how steep that hill was
Love it. 😂
Forza Horizon IRL
The off-road drifting was cool to watch ngl, but everything before that was very hard to watch
F in the chat for FUCK FERRARI😂
Easily earned my subscription
Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo next
When did forza get such realistic graphics?
How long before Ferrari’s cease and desists letters lol
Lamborghini should pay you to showcase their new off-road huracan
where did you buy the Ferrari from
Honestly with Ferrari stupid terms they have, I really hope they see this video and just have a open market 🤣
Your audience is all children
Looks like Dukes of Hazard but done in a Ferarri
Meanwhile we all came here to see this guy destroying his Ferrari which we even can’t afford to buyy 😢😂
I laughed so hard when all the crap came flying at the car , cant wait to see how he totals it
But can it be a tractor?
Me in forza horizon 5
Bro playing Forza Horizon in real life!
6 year olds after their mom cleans their room: 13:21
who watches this idiot?
I watched just for the handsome looking guy in uniform 😉. But I'm also glad that the car was fine in the end.
Ferrari, we sued god for making tomatoes and strawberries red...
I feel like he's going to make a his property into a dirt track. Eventually Whistlindiesel will buy a private island, & is going to be a Michelin star judge for restraunt but equivalent to the automotive industry. Where if a car survives his test, he'll give it an authentic certification signed off by him.
Manz fina get banned from Ferrari
😂bro really got a lot of fucking cash to test Ferrari patience and see what they will do.
There's a Ferarri 296 GTB in the item shop on Rocket League right now. This video is so cool and fun to watch that it's kinda tempting me to buy some overpriced polygons.
Should drive it through i big pile of horse 💩 🐎🐴
This was relatively painful to watch
You make me sad
Bro thinks it’s forza 5 😂
pov everybody that has played forza horizon be like
the purpose of your channel is to waste money, just like your iq, it's gone
I think you need to buy one of those inflatable bubbles people walk in on water but for a car
Just sayin, but I think red cars are nicer when they’re convertibles……….
i used to understand his antics but now its just turned into him finding silent ways of screaming he has a small dick and no brain cells
The new Forza game is looking pretty realistic
Bro I died at the end 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣😂😂😂😂  I really care about my cars and then proceeded to  throw the whole shop at the car 😂 13:17
That bubble tent thing is kinda cool
I love how you do this fuck the system car is great, it's a great car great machine, fuck the system tho 🫡
Great video also the Ferrari sounds a bit like a V8 F1 car
🫡🤣
That was actually a nice propaganda for ferrari. It survived pretty much intact a entire video os WD!
Who needs a truck lift kit in this Ferrari 🤣🤣🤣 Remember a big one  Not like a 9 year old they have too small but i manage to fit . . . . ..   .   . . .         I am going to hell
Poor thing went through 70% depreciation in 10 minutes.
I remember watching you ride around on the 4 wheeler on tiller wheels 😂 I know you run on hater tears but the videos have just gotten better and better as time goes by. I hope you and Ms.WhistlinDiesel are doing great and enjoying life, you guys deserve it
That's nothing 🙄 I lit $500k in $1 bills on fire and pissed on it.
I took a screenshot of the personalization plaque, so that I do not accidentally buy this car.
Could you destroy my auto loan lol
I dare you to make tractor durability test
I saw You talk on a interview.  You seen like a cool, smart  young man. I  wonder how you can destroy so much ?  Dont you have to pay for some of the stuff ?
If anyone saw the lambo in 5:22 he should have raced it😢
@7:59 A Ferrari Horse Stallion in it's NATURAL Habitat The WILD Extremely RARE Never will see anywhere else but here!
I’m genuinely surprised the bubble worked so well. Now is the bubble excavator bucket proof?
Hang in there bro, I know life seems rough, but it'll get better!
Njirt😭
if you think about it: this is the evolution of the iphone drop lol. eventually u destroy super cars, watches, luxury homes (and probably around here it becomes terrorism lol), buildings, etc
Ferrari is gonna throw a tantrum over this
Dudes just playing Forza at this point
He’s playing forza
I'm so happy you didn't fuck this one up. Looks like so much fun
I’m not even mad. That shit looks like a lot of fun!
"These sensors are so sensitive, they're even more sensitive then Farrari" had me dyin' 😂⚰️
😂😂😂😂😂
The amazing part is the dirt texture is off on the car for the most part
put it right next to the beat up G wagon, can you make a Rap music video after with all the broken cars?
Well that was 14 minutes wasted. Click Bait moron.
You can't sue a person after they buy your car they can do whatever they want with it
It...  sounds like a seadoo spark limiter bashing
I couldn’t make it past the passenger seat abuse. As an old school car enthusiast, being hard on vehicles just isn’t my thing.
Yes he did not destroy it thank god
Lmao the scream edits every time a ladder was tossed off screen.
This is like me playing on forza lmao
Nothing in this video is worse than a Ferrari spinning out leaving Cars and Coffee and hitting an old woman in a V6 Mustang.
Can we get a the grand tour (top gear) themed episode with tyre fryer and freed diesel. I think it would be epic.
He basically is my forza character
WRX vs EVO torture test
umm when do you destroy it ? click bait
I see a guy who needs to pay more in taxes.
Ferrari will newer sell car to you again.
That damn cover works pretty good. LMAO!!!!
why was this video taken down
This is awesome 🎉
I felt I threw something as well  Love it
My intrusive Forza horizon thoughts
I think that Ferrari is ran by The Italian Mafia.
A man may do anything with the car that he acquired with his cash but to disrespect someone's labour and art in such a vile way is just unmatched, I feel there should be prison sentences for this kind of action.
Rock Crawler Rock Crawler!!!
You ARE the BIGGEST POS THAT HAS EVER WALKED THE FACE OF THE EARTH !!!!!!!!!!! YOU REALLY ARE SUCH A DUMB A-- !!!!!!!!!!!!  SPOILED RICH KID SPENDING DADDY'S MONEY !!!!!!!!
Make burning video where the exhaust melt!!!
The ending was hilarious you ole boys got some arms on ya. Kept a hell of a pace on the random fly objects 😂 and the screwdriver at the end was perfect 😂 banger video as usual
Holy fuck im bouta buy that bubble 😭 😂
F feffari a arogant concern trying to dictate you what you can/cant do with your own property...
Crazy how good of a driver he is
You are officially my new favorite person!
love the Furrraeray cat comment.  Do it!  This is going to be fun.  I hate the fact that this makes me proud to be an American. LMFAO

Anyone else like the vid before it started???
bro is playing forza irl
Nice drift bruh 😅
I just need a new set of teeth. If you could let me part out that F8 when your done I'll send you before and after shots . Thanks. 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
What a spoiled twat
Man loves to watch the world burn I fucking love it remember on the old videos with the It's sema truck that everybody went nuts about fucking love it.
Man what an idiot , I mean who owns that many ladders anyway! Keep it up man love watching you destroy so many feelings
The machine gun sounds while they're throwing shit at the bubble canopy lmao
My brother calls them poorrari

Dude. If you want to throw money away, THROW IT HERE..

8:25 not the deer hiding in the bush scared to death

Surprisingly, this Ferrari would make an excellent farm car
How many wheel spacers can it handle
I love this guy he's so fun to watch
13:55 Vietnam Flashbacks ASMR
my view goes towards the making of this video
That bubble is crazy good. Great marketing for the Enzo owner too!!
I expected more im disappointed
You forgot to throw the kitchen sink
All supercar owner are piss right now
Now we wait
Bro, instead of spending $400,000, you could’ve just gave me 100 grand so I can move out of my house that is about to collapse
More than anything, I'm impressed by the durability of the bubble protector at the end. Definitely buying one for my Kia.
Put a lamborghini engine it it
If Ferrari should do anything with this video it should be making an off-road vehicle today!!!!
Put a lamborghini engine it it
Put a lamborghini engine it it
Put a lamborghini engine it it
Put a lamborghini engine it it
The company that made that bubble should use that last clip as advertisement🤣
That thing. Has no traction
Hey let me see howany idiots I'm gonna get to watch my video aspacily this one that's what every YouTubers are doing is do anything's ng just to get ppl to watch it's stupid
Imagine giving the ferr a 6in lift or something higher
PUT A LAMBO ENGINE IN IT 😂
Nice haircut
extremely idiot's
Such a shame. It's like buying an expensive cnc machine and using it as a fucking shovel. Waste of a fantastic car.
congrax!  you are likely the number 2 on the ferrari blacklist lol
Please,  I have to know where you got all your wealth!!! Seriously please tell me..
That bubble wrap thought
I just bought a car 🚗  what is this hahahaha
How I drive my Ferraris in Forza
Instead of destroying it should have donated to other people why white people are so selfish? That’s why they are not happy with their life unsubscribe this white boy
13:17 they threw the entire damn shop at it
Bring back the wagon wheels!!!
So gonna get a law suit
Forza IRL
I think ur getting sued
4:45 this guy
Forza horizon IRL😂
See if a hyundai santa cruiz can tow a gooseneck
Best Ferrari promotional commercial ever!
So far so good. Let's see her do some more hill climbs! Hilarious ending.
that was the weakest form of testing i have seen from you, you have become soft i believe
Ah yes, finally someone driving a ferrari the same way I drive it in Forza Horizon.
Can't wait
Put it in the giant paper shredder at the recycling yard.
i am impressed by the car bubble
Ngl, as funny as this was, I feel robbed that the car is in one piece.  Oh yeah.  Spoilers.
I'm getting sued just for watching this
Do you know this plus? My mind is has 3 points 3 million views. And it's all about you literally throwing away money. I'm one of I don't know how many people. Trying? 2. Figure? Out. How? To survive from day-to-day but yet? This is entertainment. I Guess. Don't get me wrong if you have money good for you and I suppose this channel is a source of income,  unfortunately I don't have a computer or means to make videos, I just can't imagine literally throwing away money....
Give me freedom or give me death. Clearly we chose freedom and this idiot was born
The ending was the best !!! 😂
I could feed my family... forever with that kind of money.
I bet $5 you’ll never burn a house down.
Talk about a flex
The Ferrari employees watching this like: 😭😱😂
Mr.Beast
Definitely smiled the whole time.
Decko je debil!
W
Coming from someone that's never really had much in life it's funny seeing someone destroy something so precious to some people keep it up 🤣🤣
can u crush a Squatted truck with MonsterMax2?
Damn that bubble actually held up pretty well ngl
Oh
this is what happen if you give money to stupid people
Dudes playin forza irl😂🙌🏽
This dude drives like it was on racing game
You could drop a G wagon on that bubble and it would just bounce off like nothing.
The grinding by the gas tank was top notch. 🤣
Do a video where u sell stuff, like the lifted power stroke where the wheel falls off!  😂
You gotta have money to do this for sure 😂
cool video but where do i get  a balloon like this ???
Useless post.

One of the best channels on youtube keep going. Your friend from Kuwait 🇰🇼😍👍
I don't care get off my home page.
Im waiting for part 2
wondering if we can actually BBQ inside the car. just curious.
Hopefully he goes bankrupt one day
Booooooooo this used to be slightly entertaining a few years ago, but at this point it’s this generations goal to see who’s the biggest idiot is all! 😑🤦🏽‍♂️
Very disappointed the car wasn’t folded in half and no wheels😂
Hope you cross the ocean with the Ferrari before the durability test
Love it.. fk that car up!!!
Cody is all of us in Forza Horizon
more off road Ferrari please
Whistlingdielse, I usually don’t like your content. But I really enjoy seeing someone messing with a company like Ferrari.  If you bought the car, you should be able to do whatever you want with it.  F]*{^ Ferrari!
7:30 Ferrari “let’s go places”
Be a ashame  if monster max runs this over
13:44 where the hell did y’all find a muffin pan in the shop 😂
the huracan cover got me
That’s how Ferraris are meant to be driven 👏🏽
You
Can I have it when you done with it lmao
This was a great ad for that bubble, I don’t even need one and I’m thinking of buying one just to throw things at 🤣
1st lawsuit: using a Lamborghini cover!
This hurt to watch
Have someone sit by the hood and jump off the top up there on to it
This is the prime example of what Ferrari is fighting against. Utter disrespect by uncivilized people. This is what people don't understand, Ferrari is beyond money, it's not about buying it and therefore being able to do whatever you want to it. It's about respect and appreciation of engineering and hard work put into developing the best cars in the world. Sadly for haters, who aren't on the buyers list to begin with, plenty of people appreciate Ferrari's and understand what the brand is about, and always will. You don't understand Italian culture, you have no concept of pride, heritage, tradition, etc., and therefore can't have respect for any of it. Sadly for you, a lot of people do. Ferrari ain't going out of business any time soon, they're just making sure that their products generally don't get into the hands of those who don't deserve them.
I have to un follow him after this one 😔
Dude that’s a  corvette you got scammed just send it to me man il let my grandma putt it around town an do you a favor
Man the things I could do with $400K 😭😭😭😭😭
Did Ferrari put you in the black list for this? Like 50 cent?
Part 2 please!
Cash app me
I absolutely support Ferrari and anyone who doesn't understand them is just an imbecile, 99% of this comment section being the perfect example of it. Dumb and disrespectful people who lack about 80 IQ points and about 12 years of school to be able to appreciate what Ferrari stands for and to even hope to know why they'd ever want one for any reason other than showing off, which is the exact sort of people Ferrari doesn't want to sell their cars to. It's a brand for people who appreciate engineering, quality, style, cutting edge design, etc. If you don't like what they do and don't respect their work, don't buy their cars. End of story. People against Ferrari are the exact sort of people Ferrari doesn't want to be and shouldn't be associated with, which works out nicely. They have plenty of cultured and sophisticated people buying their cars for what they are and appreciating the engineering behind them and I'm sure they're laughing their ass off...oh wait, they're not, they won't even look at this video made by some random guy in order to please a bunch of dumb people who hate Ferrari to begin with. On top of it, those who wanna show off or turn them into bling-mobiles, go buy something else. Those who wanna see them destroyed, are the exact sort of people Ferrari is up against. Just immature and dumb people who have no appreciation for engineering and don't understand cars to begin with.
That final volley was impressive.
Cease and desist incoming
Dude is playing real life Forza
Incredible
bro is living in forza 😭
Mans had a Lamborghini car cover over the Ferrari. Ferrari bout to beat his ass for that lol
Looool. Pasta guys from Italy are going crazy on this one :-))))))
Best content
That is one unlucky Ferrari ,Literally getting raped!
Bro is literally playing forza irl
fuck yeah...
This car is $959,000 to buy in Australia and WhistlinDiesel is out here straight up mauling it! 🤣
Bro I’m praying Ferrari don’t sure you for this lmao
Yessssssssssss
AYE SHOUT OUT 1kMotorsports lmfao thats crazyyy
regardless of the legal team of ferrari the car holds up pretty nice
Hey can I have the car soft free since it’s destroyed   Everyone like so he’ll see it
I wish if he zoomed in and showed us the damage he did to the car But this is a hell of an ad actually Now I'm considering to buy one instead of a lambo
As long as I have HONDA FK8 TYPE-R, I am very satisfied, but unfortunately it is just a dream😂
This is the most disgusting disrespectful thing I've seen done to a high end car, and I both love and hate it. Lololol. Wooow.  *tips hat*
This is Just disrespectful
GTA's not lying supercars are best for hills 😂
Ferraris team having a panic attack 😮
Best one yet. Never seen do much mud come out if an air vent
That bubble test at the end was actually pretty impressive lol.
I imagine the look on their faces lol🎉👍🏻
He has a Lamborghini car cover on a Ferrari
What a gigantic douchebag... If you are just looking for attention, change your last name to Kardashian and sleep with a rapper
2:58 I phsycally cringed when he jumped into it like that 😂
Its supposed to be a Ferrari stress test, good bag tho.
Mans playing forza horizon IRL
That’s good advertisement for that bubble😂
My dream car… that I will never afford or ever drive or ever see one in person. And he destroys one… 😢
This guy is insane i love it !!
I was cringing at the beginning of the video and hoping this rich and wasteful $#@!%&$# wasn't going to completely destroy a car most people never get a chance to even sit in let alone own. Hilarious on the bubble testing! Thumbs up for not destroying that beautiful machine of a car.
Do Koenigsegg its a dare
Ja rozumiem. Nikt nie każe ci być mądrym,ale naprawdę etap z drabiną to szczyt głupoty .Mam szczerą nadzieję że edukację skończyłeś w wieku lat 2 ucząc sie mówić kaka(kupa)i tak ci do dziś zostało. A jeazcze jeden drobiazg . Mam ogromną nadzieję że fujarkę w dzieciństwie ci ukręcili bo kolejnego pokolenia twoich genów to świat nie zniesie
bros playing forza 💀
that is one way to protect the car from shop damage  lol.
POV me in forza
Thinking you and DDE should be having some fun lol 😆
I remember when he was on a farm in the middle of nowhere. Look at him now. Fuck it up brother!!!
This is how people treat their cars in GTA Online but in real life
Kinda want to see that bubble vacuum sealed looks strong
RYAN UPCHURCH MONSTER MAX 1
its just like forza horizon in real life, luckily the car is pretty ugly
Hey morons, look! He's destroying expensive shit again for popularity. This assclown....
Ferrari fliping the hell out fr
Unless that's a gimbal with a camera in the passenger seat recording Cody's driving. Can we observe a moment of silence for that man's life?   One minute later... I now know why Cody bought the massive Rock hauling truck. It was to carry Cody's and his camera man's balls around. Super cars have tiny interiors. No way in HeII would their balls fit in there with them. I imagine their nutz hanging from Monster Maxx and still dragging the roadway like a bride's dress train. With two Toyota Hilux's following behind with one set of nutz in each truck.  Have I said how amazed I am at the size testicles these two have? Huh? Have I? Have I said anything, about my amazement of nutsacks dragging behind these fellers??? Like a pair of Chinese Spy Balloons busting the seems of a pair of Lee jeans. Good Good Almighty. OSHA  approved, FEMA on standby, Homeland Security watching the gate. FBI calling Cody to find the thieves of Tennessee and Indiana Intrastate skid steer stealing ring going down. CIA calling Cody to let Cody know when the President will be flying over his property. Border Patrol escorting him into Mexico for Street Racing Episodes. Donald Trump has called Cody to see if they could transplant Mar A Lago onto Cody's estate. Big Baller moves. The man could sell his 💩 and mason jars of his farts on Ebay.
Was that Ryan dunn’s crash site …
I've bought some Cannabis to smoke it all up and it only costed me 100 bucks😁
this man do what forza average players do, to real life 💀

Having never watched a whistlin diesel video, this was possibly the most painful experience of my life
Your definitely getting sued you bought a Ferrari
Didn’t go as hard as I thought he would
This was really just a giant commercial for buying one of those CAR BUBBLES!
I was waiting for him to shoot that bubble with a crossbow
Forza be like
Christ what a fucking jackass. Abusing something special like this just underscores why you don’t ever need one. I get people are entertained by death and destruction, but this is really retarded.
Dude you need to fly me out there like for my birthday 😂😂😂
😂
That ending was funny I’m surprised that bubble really took all that abuse
you are just stupid
Love it !  Million smiles
On a serious note he is a good ass driver
Hopefully this one ends up in jars that we can purchase..
Many people will hate this man but I say he is just testing it
Meanwhile in Ukraine…..🤔
POV: me in Forza horizon
This is the year 2023, human beings are supposed to have evolved, however, this kind of content still exist and even get likes!?! What's wrong with you people!?!
nahh dis is dedas da best vid😂😂
seeing a Hilux and a Ferrari in the same shot on a dirt road is the most insane thing i've seen in a while
That’s what you call. Fuck you money.
I don't like Ferraris, but the ad is fucking awesome. ;)
The owner of Ferrari is watching this and probably going crazy 💀
then the scammers came in and hunted him down and scammed him to no end  even made  him walk a long distance to send them money  then he told me what took place and we stop it all he the most honest person i know but a hell of worker and  very picky at his own work  from being a x contractor and    concrete and structural builder, its all about the long lasting structures to with stand storms or earth     quakes, and even the    whistlindiesel man might try to destroy it but  could not.  but with limits of what built for what conditions.
And on today's episode "how to get a lawyer"
i got an idea for the next video, give me a car or a bike
You forgot the kitchen sink! Why do I say that, you ask? I reply: glad you asked, it seems you threw everything else at it!
Bubble cover prices rn 📈
Mama Mia , Santa Luchia, Deva Maria. I like dat.
Dude there is something very very wrong with you 🤔.  I love it!
This hurts so much to watch but i love it!
The end had me 🤣🤣
I NEED the answer to this question ... How does this man make money
oh ya i forgotten to say h e lost his home from vandalized, trucks destroyed by criminals, and identity stolen, bank accounts hacked into and funds stolen and life destroyed and company . and not allowed any justice in the usa..  plus he  is a DISABLE AMERICAN VETERAN and fought in many wars.. and was hurt in line of action doing his job.
Destroy a Tesla
Best ad that bubble company ever gonna get
Dude is awesome..makes me laugh everytime 🤣
Bro playing Forza
a friend of mine  was stalked and hunted down non stop  and was sued by people and even forced to sign plea deals under gun point and home invasion and many attempts on his life and yes big corp. will do what ever they want  but the color of blue that is corrupted  will way pass the corp corruption  because color of blue has no lines from local police officer all the way threw county sheriff officers and judges and district attorney  and even up to the attorney general and  fbi and secrete service officers also could be corrupted look at the house and senators also and speaker of house  and see the corruption and even the president  family as well  on the corruption side  and miss handling classified documents, and now your dealing with a corp that has  every thing on that car has a patent on it so you they will file sue  but since your just driving it and may hit something by mistake then they can not file any law suit on you plus if you alter it then the warrant is void  asap so have fun in the  sun with this and in the rain and hail and snow and do what you do best  and good luck in the mud out on the farm.
why
i just tried to watch this but i cant help but find it so disrespectful to treat peoples dream car with such contempt . This is my personal dream car but i will never own one so seeing this was terrible!!!!!!!
That ferrari sounds sick!
This brings me joy
This ones just sick, love to see that thing in the dirt and gravel ripping around
put blue truck nuts on it..... or do you have the balls hahaha
He drives how I play Forza... Also, I need that bubble

Oh dear someone's gonna get sued

Dude if you doning this to a car it's hurting as a car guy like you could also gif back to your community witch a nice car would be awesome  but nice vids my dude 💪🏻
Ship in Zambia 🇿🇲 Africa I’ll teach how damage with our bad roads💀💀
All that money you spend on cars Just to destroy them can be use to help other countries that need help. All that money can help more then one village. You can help them with food, school, hospital and shelter. I just don't get it..
It’s only a material thing ppl calm down
Engine swap
Im curious as to what isin the boxes behind the Ferrari
That’s a stupid!  U could donate the money of that car to hungry kids or Turkey, or Ukraine!
Hey. Did Ferrari put you on their blacklist for this stunt?
Are you going to make Ferrari Jars like you did with the demolished GTR?
but will it stop bullets?
The impressive thing about this car is that it's two-wheel drive and it goes up hills better than some 4-wheel drive cars do 🏁🤣🏁
Love it
I don’t know if it’s financially responsible but for the good love of God we love you for it. Someone give this man $1 billion so we can watch him do all the S we wish we could with it.
Its like forza but then real life lol
😂😂
lets get him a f1 car next
This was a total waste of Money you could have fed a small nation with that money but attention means more to you than humanity, Ferrari not Farreri and you could have at least used a Ferrari cover instead of a Lamborghini Huracan Cover IJS Dude
Sorry for bad english, and also : people can do whatever they want with their money , since they got it by themself. 🤑🤪 But here i am , hungry and sad and poor with littles sis' and bro' and unable so make my mom happy, living in a bad caravan, and there is this video. With a dude who buy dreams car and then destroy them.  Just because.   (Here we lost everyone who was reading)  Sooooo little kill joy here, i know~, i know~!  i hate it too when it's my turn to read them . But i'd like to remember to everyone the other side of the world.......and i'm in a bad mood, so i will cringe on this text later, -bye-fuck-you-all, i don't hate you
Seeing a stunning car get destroyed like that made me sad. How ever it probably had a better life compared to other ferrari that just sit on the road all the time or in the garage and never leave
Ferrari are just a bunch of crybabies and pu*sies, and I'm glad that he is getting attention by provoking them and "ruining" the car by their standards, even though he bought it, and he should be able to do whatever he wants to it. Much support, keep provoking them. Show them that they are wrong!!
Of course you did
shut up and get off my feed.
this guy is living in gta online
Bro’s playing gta😂😂
Can you tow a skid steer?  Considering to buy to tow mine
It’s Tax season guys… this is his business.. EVERYTHING is a write off… Jajaja.. he ain’t dumb he’s not losing 400k just like that…

This angers me that some fool has enough money to destroy a Ferrari for a YouTube video I’m sick of you and people like you
He should drive the red ferrari in a pen with bulls
Reminds me of canonball with the countach and the police chase
those flight cases are really cool looking

Eu no Brasil assistindo esse vídeo pensando e mentira mais não é kkkkkkkk
Quel abruti
This is the best Ferrari ad ever
Ferrari will ban this guy from buying one lol
Squat it
He offroaded that Ferrari more than dudes that have a built-out Jeep/truck
No chance we see another video from him, Ferrari just killed the man
Think we need to see how well it jumps👀
after that video Ferrari entered WRC
why was the plate on in some clips and off in others
This guy just wrote history, won my admiration at little after quarter, now i am halfway trough the video and here goes my like which i do give on one in few hundreds of videos, maybe even gonna get me to subscribe at the end or when i see the bugatti video hehe. Damn thats a beast
That Ferrari really wanted to play in the dirt not gonna lie, she took (most of) that like a champ!
This video is amazing but I’ve not seen enough people mention how savage that car sounds
Enjoy the lawsuit lol
It's just awful. keep going
This was amazing 😂
This is weird but totally entertaining
Oh my god lmao. This is the wildest video I’ve ever seen 😂
Me when playing gta 5
Jesus can save you
I have officially seen everything now and I can die knowing that! 😆 🤣 WD you are a Legend 🙌 👏
since he's able to do this, he should be legally allowed to sue Ferrari if it fails his durability tests
No one else hear the gunshots during the bubble test???
Literally the whole time i was going like OH MY GOD OH MY GOD hahahahahaha
Dark mode version of Mr beast
You are a professional asshole.

Actually love to see this kinda content I’m new here but man I smiled all the way through this watching how destroyed the rari is and the cease and desists letters and emails this man is gonna get for the car 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
@WhistlinDiesel "Hey dude! When watching your videos, I noticed that there are a ton of people hating on you and your ideas and pretty much what you do. I just wanted to say that you are if not the best then at least one of the best YouTubers doing awesome and very amusing things". ✌️
This guy has earned the degree of 'VISUAL TORTURE'
What about the kitchen sink…
Its like something Bam Margera would do back in the day
I'll give ya a Dollar to be in your're next video and help you break some shit, & I'll buy the Beer!?!
🤣🤣🤣😭😭🤣🤣🤣💯💯
7:57 ... me in Forza
Good luck with ur life ban ban from Ferarri ;)
Dude I was dying the whole time I bet hanging with you must be a riot 😂 🤣
It’s your money. You “earned” it by making videos on the internet. But intentionally beating up and trashing something that most people will never afford and others take years to obtain for internet clout makes you look like Paul brother or every other Rich tool on social media. Be better WD.
13:19 the garage has a BM n the ferrari still lives hahahahahahhaha
🤣🤣🤣🤣 I need an oxygen tank! Never laughed so hard in my life.
I hope I'm  not the first one to say this. this guy needs to use his money to help better the world. obviously he has money to burn. I get it. he makes money from doing stupid things to get attention. Sadly people pay more attentons to this then someone who tries to better the world.
"It's a safety feature if you hit fences or guardrails  as he removes stick from the hood vent, 😆 lol
gift me a ferrari i dare you
Wait till the end 😂😂😂
I have a question why not give the Ferrari to a subscriber. Passionate about Ferrari since I was a kid I would like to be able to get it back.
You could've gave that money to chari- STFU YOU SNOWFLAKE SWINE GO GET SOME MONEY AND EAT C0CK YOU POS.  BROKE WOKE SWINE
Can't wait to know the result
I hope Ferrari doesn't see this😂
The company that mad that bubble canopy should use that clip for advertisement.
I don’t know if they will actually take it from you, but they might actually try to sue you and will ban you from ever purchasing another one of their cars. I honestly don’t blame them. It’s their cars and they don’t have to sell it to you if you aren’t going to respect it. Ferrari is a classic brand and they want to uphold certain standards
can’t do a cease and desist when it’s destroyed
How does it Hold up to Shopping Cart Damage ?
I wonder if he made more money from this video over what he spent for the car 😅
Ls swap it
the italians loading there pistol with hollow point pasta rn.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 made my day :-D ( Czech republic )
Please put this on buggy wheels
🔥🔥🔥
Video finished. Immediately hit the web for used Ferrari sales to grab me a new Wip
Not to be mean, but it is kind of weird that you were destroying some of the some peoples dream cars
I bet they will sue you for using a Lamborghini cover on it
Possibility that you gift me this car? Please
The only thing you guys didn’t throw at it was a bullet lmao 🤣
Wow
It makes me happy to see someone do this to a Ferrari without a single fuck to give.
Buy a XLP

Nearly cried watching this but it certainly holds up hahaha
You're gonna get sued by ferrari

Monster Ferrari Max vehicle should be the next project

Tbh they should pay you, I never knew they were so tough
there is a direct correlation between how long Cody makes us wait for a new video, and how fappable the new video is.
Put buggy wheels on it
Didn't really destroy it
I would have spent $400,000 to help physically disabled and homeless veterans. Sad

Tell me why whistlindiesel life is GTA in real life 🤣🤣🤣
Nah bro you can't do that to a car man
That’s how I drive in forza lmao
No one:  Forza horizon car's:
I don’t even do that in Forza
i would say enzo ferrari would be proud of this but he more than likely would not give a single fuck
His other videos don't give me anxiety nor do I care about Ferraris but this one did
458 somthing cheap. Hi from South Africa
This cures depression 100%
I belive this was more of an add for that bubble because it definitely impressive
And there are people who literally don't have food to eat...

Buy Ferrari f40 AND destroy
I can't stand this guy's videos for more than 3 mins,it's painful
Whistlin's treatin that Ferrari like he's playing Forza Horizon.
Can you really make this much money from making stupid videos on YouTube?
never thought i would watch a video that is heart breaking while giving me anxiety and being hilarious at the same time
Just subscribed, and bro you are hilarious. Great “hangin with the boys” humor
im am mentaly crying rn
"Give me a hammer."
Į work 3 jobs and bearly feed my family and now I just watched this ….
Bro that’s so funny
His videos never stop getting better😂🤣
You are the proof that cars like this should in actuality mean nothing. IT changes your whole perception of Supercars.
GET THAT MAN OFF THE SAW
This guy is the new TAXTHERICH I used to love watching that guy drift his f40 across a grass field 😂😂
This is me when I’m playing Forza
This hurt to watch

And information about your cars extended warranty as well. Please have great day. See *note*    *Jk, I don't give a rat's @!# about a ferrari. You may have a future in formula 1. Keep making great content!!!!!!*
Bro this shit is actually hilarious. This is the most torn I’ve felt in a minute
That ending was beautiful 😂😂😂😂
Yeah this guy is just a fucking idiot with too much money, change my mind.
I want one so bad, and here you are just destroying one. You could just give it to me.
idk how ppl can hate on such good content.
As I’ve gotten older. Part of me really loves seeing my favorite car of all time getting destroyed. It’s truly the nicest Ferrari ever in my opinion and I’d never buy one at this point. They don’t make enough sense to. So this is a solid video
W promo
Clickbait title. I remember the good ole days when you actually used to destroy cars not just get them muddy and scratch the bumper and call it "destroyed"
When Forza Horizon happens in real life! 😂😂
Need some paddle tires on the back and skis for the front. Just like old times. 😂
it held up surprisingly well, for having to spend 14:11 with @WhistlinDiesel
Bro this dam bot
I want to see the face of Ferrari CEO😂😅
Bro I do wanna come chill with you and your crew...your videos are freaking hilarious and I love the fact that so many people getting butt hurt over them 😂😂
May be the greatest commercial for that car bubble

Is this what kids aspire to these days 😂😅🥹
12:12 lmaooo
Driver warning ⚠️ you could get sued

Tbh, All ferrari owners would love to drive theirs like you just did 🤣 they won't tho

Wow these things are good off road, needs a lift and some 37s.

I hat everything about this video 😡
Forza horizon irl
If the company of fERRARI wasn't a bunch of cucks this would be hard to watch. HOWEVER....
Absolut legend
Sei solo una persona triste con un’esistenza ancora più triste. La prova è che devi distruggere un’auto stupenda solo per farti passare il prurito al cazzo…. Evidentemente hai avuto dei problemi in famiglia da piccolo, forse i tuoi genitori ti picchiavano e tu povero demente come sei devi sfogare la tua rabbia . Rimani una persona ignorante che non sa apprezzare la storia di una casa automobilistica che ha fatto la storia dei motori.  Dovresti farti vedere da un bravo psicanalista per capire se la Merda che hai nel cervello è colpa della tua inutile esistenza o colpa di tua madre che ti ha messo al mondo non pensando che un sacco di merda avrebbe potuto partire un’idea malata come questa.  Good bye from ITALY escremento.
How to watch a DDE video without watching DDE lol
I’m surprised this guy hasn’t gone after a fifth-gen 4Runner yet.
is anyone else waiting for this video to get taken down and get replaced with a video titled "So im getting sued" lol
and i was mad cause smething makes noises when i hit potholes in my e90 ....
Can we take a moment to say that, that car sounds so good!
I don't think Ferrari's lawyers have ever drafted up a Cease and Desist  so quick 😂😂😂😂
All I want to know is where to get Thicc-fil-A badges
Whistlin Diesel is just here to show us that a 400k Ferrari is just a car like the toyota Hilux for example
6:35 sensitive
Imagine wasting $400,000, when someone is probably struggling with $20z
W
4:55 GAWDDD YESSIRRR
This guys playing forza horizon in real life
Everyone, dreaming about having an expensive car like this. Meanwhile WD treating it like a clapped out 99 Civic...
This is just too far
bro, instead of ruining such a car, give me a present
3:44 BRUHH😂😂
Ferrari purists are punching the air right now
1:45 in a good way
Take care of this one brother..... I just want to see you lift it 6 inches and turn it into a rally car lmfao
1:27 lmaoooo we just started and it’s falling apart
I though it was click bait... Not dissapointed.
Bro looked like he was playing forza irl
He’s never gonna be able to buy a Ferrari again
this why i watch this dude lmaoo
You have a problem mate....definitely the only way to get attention....is this dumb way...obviously you can't drive and you can't appreciate a jewel ....just because you have money and you bought it somehow...it shows on the way you talk....!!!!
Ferrari is my dream car and this dude bought it to destroy it 🫥 It hurts to watch
OMG! It's soooo wrong but at the same time so good!! :-D :-D  Please send the new G-Wagon 63AMG 4x4 rock climbing in Moab! And call @trailmater in case you're stuck!
Imagine camping in the woods and hearing a ferrari constantly screaming
You gotta be a pro driver or something 😭
Ferrari should be enter WRC❤
That bubble is stronger than my relationship. Bruh
Ferrari sounds so sexy
I actually really enjoyed watching a car get abused for once
I'm just impressed by how much crap they managed to throw at it 🤣
How tf are you still relevant all you do is destroy shit lmao
who needs consumer reports  ?
13:34🤣🤣🤣🤣
we want part 2
This video hurt me..
why just why ?? why is this kid destroying his shit on camera and is somehow famous. like the cash me outside girl.
I like to thank your haterz for how they keep pushing you into greatness 😂😂👌👍🏼😎 also I love the fact that you still test the  durability of vehicles just the vehicles cost more now plus noone else has the BALLS or nerves to test out high end vehicles like you ... with all that said keep up the great work .... have a feeling after all the testing we can buy a jar of red  Ferrari peices 😂😂😂😂 cant wait ... I should have bought 1 jar of every vehicle you have done so far owell shit happens
he didnt distroy it completely😂
اتحداك تجيب porsche 911 turbo s
IRL Forza
forget those cars, tell me where to buy that military outfit :D
For the video you should have rented a Ferrari for a day and then try to return the wrecked one
😂😂😂 The “salad toss” was the hidden gem in this video haha
mate i’m 17 please buy me a car please man 🥺
pain...
Now this is respectable make the richies cry
hahahahahaha love it! fuck those guys at Ferrari
i am gonna cry for this car
No way he didn’t piss them off at the beginning putting the Lamborghini cover on to a Ferrari
I feel like this is the best video of yours
I can hear the car fudds already
forza horizon 6
Ferrari should hire you🤷🏻‍♂️
That video title will get Ferrari to put a bounty on your head….. 👁️👄👁️
this video hurt my soul a lil bit
Bro is thinking he is in forza horizon
he needs mr beast funding
😂
Fuck Ferrari!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Yes 👏 👏👏👏👏
Ok, what is the possibility that Ferrari refuses to sell this guy a car ever again?
That thing sounds so good tho
Literally had me laughing and smiling the whole 14 mins. Great job!
Bet you won’t lift it and turn it into a rally monster
I like the way you treat something that health people usually buy.
GTA irl
most impressive part of the whole video is how far they can throw ladders. ;-D
Now you cant buy one for the rest of you lives, nice vid idea tho
13:17 fav. part 🤣🤣🤣
It’s still alive? That’s actually so disappointing.
You have a tank right ? Will a it survive raming a ferrari into it?
after you put it through the wringer please take it to a supercar show with snobby owners
Give me a hammer 😂😂😂
Ferrari won’t take kindly to this
Another ignorant hick trying to prove... absolutely nothing. I hope Ferrari will recover this "state of art" from the hands of this cannibal.
click bait, he didnt destroy it
The need for speed edit🤝
Forza Horizon 4 In real life be like : 0:00 - 14:11
Not to be that guy, but if u think about the craftsmanship Ferrari puts in their cars , not to mention pride, you’d understand why the Ferrari has a legal team to fry kids like this.
Let’s see how well built they are!
Im surprised how this car survived all those bumbs and mud… paying brand is not just flexing but also paying quality. Imagine doin that with some m5…
I feel like at the 13:00 minute mark all ferrari reps and dealers and higher ups were all just jaw dropping appalled
13:18 "if you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball..."
Dont do that pls give tu me
Do a BMW M3 soon!
How the **** does that Ferrari get up that grass hill?! Wonderful video, thank you!
Beamng real life
best free PR you can make to Ferrari.. xd
Bro your shit is on the news
I get massive immature vibes from this guy but not from the likes of heavydsparks and Adamlz, I feel like when I watch these videos I can somehow feel how annoyed this guy is at idk what, not how much he loves what he does. It could just be me or my perspective but I get it on every video I’ve seen
When the Fort Zancudo guards find your car:
bro is playing Forza IRL
Ferrari black list
Please buy my Jeep. I need to get rid of the damn thing.
where does this guy get his money to do this
Actually awesome seeing the car go thru the dirt roads and hills. Ferrari should honestly appreciate the durability test, tho we all know they won't. Looking forward to the next video on the car.. if it lasts that long. Cheers stay healthy 😁
Should lift it and put some knobbies on it before you trash it
Bro really just playing Forza horizon fr! 😂
Ah, very clever to place the ad for the mobile car garage in the end >_>
The ending killed me 😂
Bro I been waiting for you to by a Ferrari to fuck it up lol can’t wait to see it !
Best cease and desist letter to be written coming soon
FORZA 5 GAMEPLAY☠️💀
The fact that Ferrari sold it to him is fascinating because they definitely know what he’s gonna do to it haha
Lots of commercials holy sht
Me the whole time: 😬😬😬😬
Hahaha you made Google news.
mans playing forza irl
Uhh.. Cody..  What are *all those* cases for?  😲🤯🙊
After a couple of years of watching @whistlindiesel while unsubscribed, I proudly announce that we have subscribed. Great work. If you need a jury member, dm us.
hahaha i love it
Ferrari ain’t gonna be happy about this💀💀
I love how everyone finds This cool he bought a car that coast more than some people will ever make in there life time to destroy it and as the every day working class American it sucks to see how we barely can take care of are family’s but this kinda shit happens everyday by people with no work effort
Thank you for your service of reminding you not to be retarded
The cease and desist suit gon be crazy
Guess who is gonna be getting a cease and desist from Ferrari next.
5:44 hahahaha I'm out of breath!!!!
Stop being ridiculous
Everyone take aim… FIREE!!!!
Dude sold me on the bubble.
You presume off
We've been trying to reach you concerning your vehicle's extended warranty. You should've received a notice in the mail about your car's waranty! lol
bro could have given me that beauty instead of doing that... still the video was fun  but pains a little bit seeing that car being slaughtered
I would pay money to see a shot facing the guys throwing stuff at the Ferrari
this is duch a easter od money. you could send this money to support ukraine which is im war right now
" It's repelling *me* "  😅😅
This is literally Forza horizon in real life
just got a new toy
Bros playing forza in real life
Look at this guy's face. He looks exactly like someone who destroys more than he produce. A face of a douchebag.
Remove that PPF and scratch it !!!!
Ferrari will be in touch .
Really he's right about Ferrari this is going to be one of those videos where I'm going to enjoy watching him destroy this half a million-dollar car warning  Ferrari might sue you this is hilarious love it
Im from italy and this video hurts our heart. You can do with Lamborghini we dont care but with the rrari… we 😭😭. 😂😂
When you rag on stuff and tear stuff up for views but are actually pretty good at driving/drifting
'
Just kicking the Rev limiter square in the face
Sales add for the car bubble 😂
Idk man he was quite gentle with it, I think he'll get away with it
He didn’t destroy it!
Spoiled little bitch burning daddys money you ungrateful fuck
Bro is playing gta irl

The ending was perfect 😂😂😂
Wow, that's a cool fast sports car!

When all the things start flying at the car. That was awesome. I could not help but laugh 😂
When all the things start flying at the car. That was awesome. I could not help but laugh 😂

Best car bubble review 😂
Man that exhaust sound is chefs kiss, sue away
He was beating that shit up. 😂😂😂
Honestly this makes me want to buy a Ferrari
Ferrari is gonna sue him because he put on a Lambo cover on a Ferrari
fucking leggend!
Jesus Christ I love your videos stuff like this makes me so happy you have no idea, please keep up the good work Lol
forza shit lol
WhistlinDiesel is like an older brother I always wanted.
I'm am throughly entertained. Bahaha, excellent. This is Oscar material right here
What a shit video
The fact it had a Ferrari under a Lamborghini cover has me cracking up.
HAHA! Shoutout to Doug 3:20 So good! Love it haha
I am smiling the while way through this video
Good commercial for that car bubble product. Hahaha.
Don’t Ferrari sue people who disrespect their cars?
Bro is playing forza horizon 5 irl
I think it is awesome to see one of these cars ragging it about the place but why the unnecessary damage ? Like hitting things it's just a bit pointless, I think tax the rich had the right amount of aint care without being over the top
the shit that people do to get views and likes.
This is like old school @taxtherich100 and I love it
The ending…….I never laughed so hard
Forza horizon IRL
But did he get sued?
ONE MORE thing...can we ALL even the lousy fucking haters, acknowledge that Cody is seriously a legit driver!!! Drifting that Ferrari next to the Hilux on gravel and keeping control is nowhere near as easy as it looks with that much power. And let's be honest, his doughnuts....top tier
Miami vice moves to Hazzard county!!!
😂😂😂😂😂 this is YouTube content at its peak
Definitely best video yet
The video title should have been *next forza horizon map in testing*
Me in gta
You are jerk
Give me a hammer  *proceeds to throw the entire garage*
The way it swang up that hill reminded me of a dirtbike hill climb
Such a waste of money
Literally said out loud "ohhhh boy, here comes the fun part" when I seen that pile of shit coming down the road in reverse towards Cody's compound!! LET'S FUCKIN GOOOOO...alright, time to resume and continue on with yet another beautiful masterpiece of content!! FYI....every one of these videos belong in a museum. Fuck the Mona Lizzard, rip that down, hang all of these thumbnails next to them put the declaration of independence at the end of the thumbnails.
Fu*king hilarious
Literally every Ferrari fanboy is going fucking nuts right now lol
The Ferrari held up well from all of this lol
Ferrari big mad.
Wth man I can’t believe youd tear this up i want one so bad and your trying to screw it up
this hurts me alot but its very fun to watch
Am I the only one who saw the lambo cover on the Ferrari
Hope you get sued for every penny you're worth! Hope you end up bankrupt and you stop making these insulting videos!  Learn to respect the badge!
First and last time in the history of Ferrari that a Ferrari goes off roading 😂
Bro can really drive tho.
Waiting for the seize and desist video
Thatswhy you only have 3 Million Views yet.   MrBeast would really destroy it.
They threw the cat at the bubble!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
The throwing objects at the bubble going on for 40 minutes made me laugh out loud.
A wild Ferrari in its natural habitat 😆
Incroyable 😂😂
Part 2?
Whoever sold that car is getting whacked
Ferrari 😳😤
Thats why I hate rich people
Mais qu'elle Blaireau ce mec... Une génération de malades mentaux qui fait peur pour le futur de notre humanité
That was badass
Durability test 75% complete.
the throwing stuff on the bubble should be the car bubbles ad.
Spero che domani ti svegli freddo
This hurts
Who the hell cares?? I mean really lmao
They should pay you…. This had to be thee best car review I’ve seen in my life
That was so fucking funny
why wreck nice cars whats the point
I know hes got almost 5m but where does this man get all of this money
Ferrari sucks! Ford showed em that years ago :)
Don’t do this man pls 😅
This is just like Forza but in real life 😂
Your crazy bro haha 🤑😁🙏🔥
This video should have been titled forza in real life
Red is dead!
This was a blast to watch. smiling the whole time.
Earned my fuckin subscribe 😎
I NEED FERRARI TO COMMENT ON THIS VIDEOOOOOO 😂😂😂😂😂
This is some GTA vibe
COD supply crates line the back wall
If this is just a little preview for the Bugatti I'm happy lol. On the road to 10 million!
The amount of money this guy has is ridiculous, here I am worried about $1000 rent next month but we make the bed we sleep in
Why not get a 2023 Ferrari you cheap skate. Not a 2020 😭
the ending is one hell of a commercial for that product
That bubble at the end was like " are you done yet?"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀
How about you be like mr. Beast simpleton and use your money to do good and help people, the views will come not for blowing random things up for clout. 💀
He got skills ✨Donkey Kong drift
Worst time to secretly have a transformer
Finally a car brand that deserves it because how strict Ferrari is with their cars destroy that bish whistle tell ferrair you paid for it you could do what you wanted with it
People out here starving and dying. And this clown using his money for views clout chaser. 💯
😢
This is secretly an Ad for Ferrari
🤣🙊🤣
I know it’s not on brand but Cody please do something good with your money besides just destroy shit (destroying unreasonably expensive shit is still cool tho)

Well done
That tax write off was worth it😭😭😭😭
You sir are living every rednecks dream.
Bro's  playing Forza in real life
Truly a menace to society
Full grown brat. The car deserved a classy owner.

Bro is playing gta in real life
Of course he did… my family watched your g wagon video of it being destroyed on the dune and it was so funny 😂 We are waiting for the electric g wagon to come out since my mom wants to purchase it as her “weekend car” 😆
Id cry
Ti rendi conto che stai rovinando un pezzo d’arte ? Abbi rispetto della casa di Maranello
This a step up from the Back to the Future Nike workboot video. Also learned Ferrari builds an excellent choice for an everyday driver in the back roads and hills of Tennessee 🤷‍♂️
no😥
Send it like that Tesla
When Keller spit and rubbed it more that shit got me dead 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💀💀💀

This video hurt so much
If it’s red it’s dead
If it’s red it’s dead
Wait wait wait wait. Next time you decide to destroy a supercar, just give it to me instead! That way it’s not waste and doesn’t feel bad on your conscience, and you’ll know the car went to the right place! 😁
I'm not gay Cody, but will you still marry me...? I just want to be around for all of this shit 🤣
lmfao love the video dude something about that car on a old country road is kinda cool even tho it kinda sucks with all the stupid dirt pockets on it whats funny is at the end of the day.. it is still a tax write off as a  business expense so double #winning

I and others need money for real life things... glasses, oil change, post on my back portch needs to be fixed, my lawnmowerbroke last year, I would like to go on vacation one day, I haven't started saving money to retire, much less help my 5 yr old with graduation or his first baby or his bills when he needs help, income so I can come home to my family and not work over the road... so much more. Man what a waist while regular people are out here working and not having any extra money for just simple stuff like food
Oh boy, hes gonna get sued.. isnt he
A huge advertisement
It would be better to donate that money to turkey and not destroy cars worth that money bro..
This is what you can do when you inherit a fortune... Sense of values not required! Must be fun.
this is what a car is made for
Sponsored by Lamborghini

The Lamborghini cover on the Ferrari did it for me.
Dude drifting in a Ferrari😂
Best part of this video was the entire 1 minute of throwing crap at a Ferrarri in a bubble. I would like to know why you did not throw the kitchen sink at it?
aww yess, some satisfying things :D
This is so beautiful... we needed to see this gta fr!!!
I love this video
Please do more driving in mud with it
Last 1 minute deserves to be in a movie.

Did anyone else find the sound of all the tools and shit hitting the car bubble really relaxing? 😂
Forza horizon. that's all I was thinking at the start
You're a fucking bastard.  I would murder someone if I had this, and someone took a sharpie to it.    But, I don't have one, and you do.  So,  fuck shit up I guess.
What's the point? You could save yourself a lot of time and money if you'd just get that "I'm a moron" tattoo on your forehead now.
i died at 1330 hahahahahah
Forza Horizon IRL
Plz test Elon Musk Cybertruck when it comes out this year 🙏 I think we all wanna see how that new glass holds up!

Ayeeeeee you should let me get a F8 👀
Ferrari is gonna be so mad when they see this 😂😂😂 but I love it
This is cringe worthly good!
Send this video to Jay Leno. He will appreciate the trolling, lol.

Enjoy the lawsuit!...lmao!..

You are a f****** loser What is the purpose of reckoned a nice cart I cannot stand you You are a piece of s***

Could’ve just given it to me lol
If Ferrari sees this, Cody is just playing forza

Most companies throw away brand new stuff all the time. At least, with Cody, we get to enjoy seeing it. Cheers y'all

Drowning in debt and wondering when I’ll eat again and bro just dropping 400k for fun lol
Yooo Forza Horizon 6 has insane graphics!🤯
What a shit car.
As an italian car guy, watching this video hurts more then seeing pinapple on pizza
the title should've been "I bought a $400,000 Ferrari just to get sued"

Great review on the car bubble..!! $$ You are truly a mad scientist with YouTube and financial plans..!
It's totally normal for GTA V player.

POV: Me in Forza Horizon
Well, i wish i was this rich

Can I buy it for $10
Greatest YouTube channel of all time
😂
If anything this is a promotion for ferrari
There’s no way this gets seen but next time you destroy one of your cars, you should wrap it in bubble wrap because of all the haters that say you’re destroying things.
Ferrari should take your video to sell those cars !!
Honestly have no feelings towards this lol had it with the hellcat but this lol do whatever
He will never be allowed to buy a Ferrari again
Ferrari on the rev limiter…I like it 😏
Bro your videos are quality . Definitely the best YouTuber/Destroyer on the internet!
Rest in peace, Whistlin
We needed this video. Someone had to do this to ferrari executives.
This man’s dodge ball team is legendary lol😂
This video needs all the love possible… before his lawyer receives a notice..😂
I see you’ve spent time on the government auction sites 😂😂
I cannot explain how many times I cringed during this video😭
lambo cover XD
now  feel confident
There are some videos floating around of Ferraris rallying, so they probably won't care about driving it offroad tbh
Als nächste Stufe kauf dir einen Hammer und klopf damit deine kranke Birne. Hilft nicht, aber dir kann man nicht mehr helfen.
The bubble lowkey go crazy
Can we just take a moment to appreciate how effective that bubble was
K we all can tell the second last ladder was Cody's throw 🤣💯
Nice
What Ferrari model is that ?
This Hurts my Brain 🧠
It’s only a matter of months till he buys a Bugatti to demolish 💀💀 that’s so exciting and makes me nervous too damn
Even if he destroys a Bugatti in the future, this will probably be more controversial
Put some Texas swanga rims on it 😉😂
an absolute wild animal
He’s definitely blacklisted
Must be nice
Where's the kitchen sink?
He need to lift it on 35s and take it on some jumps
Koenigsegg doesn't smash their cars before they send them out, the clips were from a crash test/ durability test video of a koenigsegg
This man needs to be on Top Gear 🇺🇸.
It saddens me knowing it's an F8 Tributo, dude. The rich man inside me just died 💀
“Oil leaks” is that the answer?
3:19 The Doug demero edit literally made me laugh out loud 😂
Can’t wait for the law suit
Dudes playing forza horizon
I wish I could make videos like this
Put a lift kit on the rari
Ferrari enters the chat
ALL RED CARS ARE NO GOOD
well, it's kind of nice to see the car been use  but the abuse was a bit much honestly . you tube money do miracles .
Ferrari: you can’t do modifications to your car. Me: yes I can I have over 5 million power
Bro really threw everything he has at the ferrari
Youtube needs a double thumbs up button
Well done.
AM JUST GOING TO SUBSCRIBE TO YOUR CHABEL JUST BECAUSE THIS  VIDEO.    FERRARI THINK THEY THE SHIT.   I WILL NEVER BUY ONE  EVEN IF I BECOMES A MILLIONAIRE !!    ❤ AWESOME VIDEO ❤ !!
I made a horrible life choice. I have worked for 35 years and still am pay check to pay check. Should have been a youtuber instead of a cop....LOL. Can not believe you made so much money on youtube. Love your videos especially the one where you caught the guy that stole your stuff.
If you want an off-road Ferrari get a busted knuckle off-road rock bouncer
This is a bigger flex than any other "looky what I got channel/video."
He's gonna get a cease and desist letter.
Give it to me😎🙏🙏🙏
may i have the ferrari please lmao
That's cringe
The most deserving car of some bashing!
Lmao sold out of white balloons
Whistlin Diesel is one of those Guys who make my Day when i come home from school, totally devastated, depressed and dead inside. You always make me laugh, smile and make me forget about all my problems. Thank you sooo much and may God make you smile your whole life too as you make my face smile. God bless you :)
How much you charge for me to use the race track?
This gives the ultimate smiles per gallon. I approve!

Meanwhile...My self and my daugher are homeless, sofa sleeping....and here you are doing this lol! I mean, damn...I can't even afford a roof over out head. Fair play to you.
This hurts my feelings
Can you destroy my 4runner?
Even the haters have to admit, Cody had more fun with that car in a few days than 99% of Ferrari owners will ever enjoy their car.
Can you crash turkish togg car ? If you do that you get nice attention 🙂
Aye man I’d stop doin that to that brand bro they’ll whoop yo ass and claim it as a gift from Ferrari themselves for wrecking their baby’s
Dude is wasting money like that when I’m here tryna get a hunda :(
2.9 million views as of right now car is worth 400,000 but how much $ did he get in views from YouTube?
I'm impressed with the durability so far. I can't afford a ten year old hatchback, so this is my only source for valuable durability information. I can now make sure I don't spend money I don't have. Thank you for the video, always worth the wait!
how many ladders you got lmao
Somebody has a link to where they sell that bubble, it impressed me more than the car
We need more of this
Cody for president🤙🏿💪🏿
You should have Sam Hyde on. He has a talent for destroying cars.
Should beer bong the air scoop on the front lol
Part 2 durability…Love from 🇮🇳
this made me smile from start to finish. Impressive how the ferrari stood up to the offroading, amazing traction , and that bubble is impressive, nice driving too
If you want to sell it let me know ok! 200k here
I wonder what his next idea is: buying a Mercedes 300sl and destroying it
Omg
Nice knowing u man
This was uncomfortable to watch
Well he’s never going to drive a Ferrari again😂
日本でもケータイのニュースに出てきたぜ！（笑）あんた最高だよ
Thissssss 👌🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dude I love the editing in this video. Great content!
At this point I am wondering if Ferrari should quit F1 and enter WRC
I get the driving bit but throwing hammers and ladders at it,  what's the point
send me your g wagon now your done please lol
i would gladly take ownership of the next vehicle you decide to put through a durability test!!
The end thooo🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Hey, what's the retail on one of those!?"  "More than you can afford pal, *Ferrari* "
PLEASE DETROY BMW"s
This is strange though...how can Ferrari sue you for what you do with your car that you bought with your money. Can someone explain this
Finally a rally-rari, can’t wait to see it lifted with mud boggin rubbers
Disclaimer, I clicked this video by mistake, can’t afford to get sued by Ferrari.
Dude is living forza horizon irl

Good fuck Ferrari
And now we see Ferrari file another lawsuit😂
Damn. I can’t even buy a 20,000 dollar car to drive til it fucks up lol
Next try the durability on a Land Cruiser FJ40, but an ICON restored one with all the sport suspension and stuff to see how much they can take
Now you just need to buy a Winston cup car
Running it over with a Ford would’ve been legendary
Damn you made my day 😂

The last 60 seconds had me in tears mate 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

the GTO is basically an ENZO they should have kept it that way & never invented the GTO.. GTOs suck! go buy them & break-test them Please. This is my opinion. You should definitely do it. Many thanks & much love,  from Alex. Australia
These people just know how to destroy the masterpieces because they can't make them, poor bitc*
shameful african children could've eaten that ferrari
Should swap the engine into a Honda civic 😂
Pain for my italian heart
The only thing I got from this is, my Boys got a lot of ladders.
Forza horizon irl
One of the hardest things l had to watch on YouTube in days and I'm only halfway
Wonder how long it takes for a Ferrari to sink in a pond? What's the towing capacity of that thing?  Asking for a friend.
Ayooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

There is something satisfying about seeing a Ferrari being whipped around on gravel!
Sweet blanket.
Get with the times Cody..   nobody wants to see you destroy a Ferrari..  people nowadays want to see you destroy your body..   its time you become a woman. And chop off your manly parts..  get some boobs and a BBL.. then you will be doing something everyone wants to see..  plus you would win brownie points with the kids your age.. so be a sport and get with the times.. Plus you probably would get 5x the views.
WOW..... more Brats  ... YT is a problem...

Ferrari's new WRC platform unveiled at the WD headquarters!!!
Is there a part 2 where he actually destroys it? This video was a let down. Probably didn’t even piss off Ferrari in the slightest. He’s getting soft.
hopefully you got banned
honestly if theres anything that would make me buy a ferrari it would be this.
my guy is playing beamng in real life
🤣🤣🤣 I love your channel dude.  This reminds me of tax the rich
It’s actually quite nice to see the F8 doing this, it reminds me of the un-finished group B rally Ferrari back in the 80s to the 90s (whatever lol)  A like to this comment to support Ferrari making a rally special monster
Sei un vero idiota
That little bubble boy shield for the Ferrari worked surprisingly well. If I was the anal owner of one of those I would get that haha
Oh lawd, I can sense the C&Ds from here!

vacume seele the buble
Tbh I feel like he would get a Agera RS1 and destroy it that would be fire but….one issue the Cristan Guy of CEO of Koenigsegg He prolly wouldn’t let him do that at all so yea that’s bum part
Very good ad for the bubble
I want this level of wealth
Spray a car with line x and then try and destroy it.
Pauvre type  !
Just when I think you have done it all.. Your the fuckin 🐐 bro.

That car protector is about to make a lot of money 🤣🤣
What’s next a Bugatti 😂
Bro i like your videos but this one hurts a little cuz its a drema car for me and you just do this to it i wish if i just have ride in it even once bro
As a Ferrari hater, this is the first video on YouTube I’ve laughed the whole video through the end.  Also now I want a Ferrari.
Finally, someone who actually uses & drives his car instead of keeping it rotting in some luxuriously air cooled marble garage for decades. Bravo.
Thengarage is looking nice😅
You need a hospital
bro is holding in his tears - 💀
Now that it's been totaled, time for an LS swap, wide body, TT, and lift kit.
just loved it
at 4:14 like look ta that viper like goddanm
GTA in real life
Sheesh these are 600k in Canada
Such an unnecessary thing to do! I get it, it's your car, you can do anything with it...but it's also a work of art which is not meant to be molested that way. God knows how many car lovers would do anything to own a car like that, and treat it with respect. We live in such a fucked up world right now 👎
Anytime you see a Ferrari it’s on a trailer I heard you can’t kill a 318 mopar though
Had me laughing
First thing that comes to my mind is pasta rocket 🚀
Nobody: Me in Forza:
Man I love ur videos and somehow they In my Facebook idk how u do it but I love it keep destroying stuff and have fun man
he could have done some real good by donating the ferrari to a starving orphan in Africa, but then we wouldnt have this video would we?
2:20 sure 13:18 when mayhem starts also that crazy cool
nah bro next part of this is gonna be “daddy, i want a chiron”
This hurts to watch but its also superfun to watch
Why?!
i have a better idea, give it to me instead
when it’s destroyed I’ll take it
Mk4 supra jumps
Now he will never ever be able to buy a Ferrari again

You know your having fun when you don’t notice a single error code till there’s a problem
this dude is like the antichrist to mr beast. if they ever meet a black hole would erupt and suck in the planet
Stupido
When you're done at the end of the day if you happen to have an 05 Duramax laying around I wouldn't mind if you sent it this way I could really use it for work and other things for fixing cars at really appreciate it.... if you have one laying around..... or a 12 valve 2500 dodge ram "bout the same year and you could call it a tax write off, or charitable gift😁😁 k thanks
I'm genuinely surprised at how well it handled all the off road stuff-and honestly didn't look to bad at all after the wash either! I was expecting bits of trim to be hanging off and cracked panels... Could be an excellent car to enter in a rally as a privateer! 🤔👌

One complaint / observation : at the end , you forgot to throw the kitchen sink at it  😪 Please message me when the vid has been duly edited ......
bros playing forza horizon irl

Any normal person: giving money to people struggling. This guy: let’s by millions of stuff to destroy for a YouTube video
Ferrari won't miiind guys its okay cuz its funi lmao, also the driving skills on our man's are INSANE he handled that Ferrari in the wet like it was nothing, mad props man love the vids!
This channel seems to be trying too hard... content seems stale
Wtf🤣🤣🤣 You stole my idea for destroying every expensive car on the planet

You are a noroM 😩
Someone’s about together blacklisted by Ferrari
whistling diesel is a human version of the intrusive thoughts we all have but forget about on purpose
Dude lmfao, do you if someone said heres a ton of money, id be doing same shit
He should take the body panels off and put the body panels off of a prius on it
“Whatever’s about to happen to this car” he says 😏
Probably Ferrari gonna ban you after this video
Dayum bro i love your channel but i cried here 😂 i wish can afford atleast a corvette 😢
Couldn't afford the bugatti in the end 🤣 nice try bro! ferrari will do.. i guess. 🤔
Ferrari tries to sue him he will probably buy another🤣😂🤣
Dude is playing Forza Horizon in real life dog... :)))
Bubble at the was the best part. Loved it.
Deez nutz!
I beg you put drag tires on that Ferrari because the Ferrari is rear wheel drive via putting drag tires on it it will probably lift up the front of the car👌🏻
This should be a commercial for that car bubble
I know I'm probably do a sound like an a****** but do you spell $400,000 to destroy a Ferrari. I can barely scrape together enough change to eat throughout the month. Money comes and money goes I understand I've had it but cherish the money you do have and have been given because one day all of a sudden something will happen in your life and it will be no more I spent my life never got sick all of a sudden 11 years ago I got very sick very very very sick and then all of a sudden every dime I had went to medical bills to keep myself alive now it's all gone and I literally can barely feed myself every month just here's what you do have and do well with it he can't be gone in a fraction of second just giving you some advice
Oh the money i will pay to see the look on Ferrari’s CEO face right now
" I bought a 20,000 acre forest in LA " AND LIT IT ON FIRE

Put a dozer front on it and clear some trees.
Ferrari after this video probably put you in their black list
You can replicate the FH2 trailer at that place
This wasn’t a video about a Ferrari it was a video of the race track he has been slowly building on his land
Damn satisfying
How many people were triggered by this video 😂
Ferrari is totally right. You don't buy a piece of art and do graffiti on it.. I've never had  even the chance of getting my ass is a Ferrari's passenger seat.. and I'm Italian.. you are dumbs americans so you can't even understand but it's a shame what you did here.
This guy just did in real life what I usually do in Forza... I guess that is an accurate simulator after all :))
😂😂😂😂😂😂Stooop!!!!  😂😂😂😂😂😂
clickbait
Great commercial for the bubble wrap

Assuming whistlindiesels channel CPM pays about $8 and if this video gets 4 million views he will only make 32 grand on the video. Spend 400k to make 32k seems like the perfect investment, sign me up lol
.
Ferrari goes Rally 💀💀💀
Say what you want but this video proves Ferrari does make quality products.
Jump that bitch into the Grand Canyon fuck fagarri
Man's driving it like It's GTA Online.
This was clearly Forza 5 game play 🤣🤣
I'm laughing but at the same time sad to see such a beautiful machine getting obliterated
this is the first time ive ever seen your videos, and let me tell you im here to stay
It’s like playing gta in real life 😅
No Kitchen Sink??!! You threw everything at that rat Ferrari...except  The KITCHEN SINK!! C'MON MAN!!
Driven like how cars are supposed to be driven. Cody should be a rally driver
I don't know if I love this video or hate it
@WhistlinDiesel I'd love to see some off-road modifications done to this car. Something like Alex Choi did to Lambo for example. That would be really cool to watch too! :D Higher ground clearance, off road-ish tires, light bars, push bar, etc.! :D
I know you bought a car that looks like a $400,000 Ferrari but they're make kit cars all day bro
Needs a duramax swap
Why is there a labo’s hurricane cover?😂
Someone is getting a ban i guess xD
I have no money to pay my bills and I work 24/7. And he just make a experiment with 400k this world is so done.
Okay but hear me out…we need to convince @WhislinDiesel to join stage rally in some off the wall super car like this. Fans would love it because it’s going to be unique and would let some fans meet him in person.
That sound after the tune 🤤
This is such a satisfying video. My most hated cars next to squatted trucks.
I’ll be waiting for Ferrari to blow your phones up. 😂 Can’t wait
you're one hell of a driver cody✌✌👊
So edgy.
Money truely does buy happiness
bugatti soon
If I do not give AF was human, this guy is "IT"
Du bist so ein Köpek gib mir das Auto wenn du schon so machst ya kalb
On behalf of Ferrari we're suing you!

Хахахахах, супер, это что-то нереальное) 🤝
how much for the car sir?
pov playing for a horizon 5 irl
I was thinking his bitchass wouldn't destroy it in the first video. What a fucking pussy! Won't even destroy a $400,000 car right after he buys it!    I make $35,000 a year.
Ну наконец-то!!;)
I wish I had a car like that
Taxtherich style ferarri
Who wulda thunk

Freed' punching the air right now
This what we should use real sports car
forza horizon 5   real
you're not doing rite let show how it done 😁
I like blockhead
You're an idiot.
I was told by a Ferrari owner that if you Wrap your ferrari you can be sued by Ferrari
I just want to know who was throwing all the stuff at the end?!? And how?
When he said “I didn’t even do anything dude” 9:05 had me dying lol 😂 quality content.
Whoever made that bubble protector thing, is going to be FILTHY RICH thanks to Cody 🤣
Honest chad here, you should take the monster max to blm protest with a lgbtq flag
Ridiculous rich prick
F****** indentured chodent
Fucking love this channel
Hit the sink hole next
This is  funny
You are fckng moron. What is so amazing to take exapnsive car and wreck it , this is art of brainless . Massive idiot!
Forza vibes
Well that definitely sold me on the car bubble
What a G!!
ive seen a better ibterior on a base model genesis g80. shame on ferrari
Excellent video
I sware this guy is the best YouTuber on this whole platform at this point
now we're getting some where but whats next?
he's playing Forza horizon real life
I'm just curious if this damn bubble with the car inside will float
Eeey Idiot ,if u have too much money ,give me some !!!
Wolf of Wall Street quote is spot on 😂😂😂
(Прошу уничтожить) please destroy Toyota chaser V
Spoiler alert, he doesn't destroy it. Clickbait a hole
My predictions are these  Ferraris legal council alerts R&D that they have untapped off-road potential, very unexpected.  Next, a cease & continue letter is mailed to Cody.
This man can drive drive.
To be fair Ferrari did make tractors so going offroad could be just testing how true to heritage they have stayed
Jokes on everyone! This was an advertisement for Ferrari's durability! 🤣
AS a Ferrari fan this was painful lol. Only WhistlinDiesel
Fast and furious 10 trailer https://youtu.be/32RAq6JzY-w
He has a lambo cover 😂😂😂
an idiot is an idiot
incoming crutch made my day.
GODAMNIT bro
Cody, if you wont stop doing this my old Ford Focus I can die very soon... Please let me have this car, its my only one...
bro playing forza in real life
Give me a Hammer 🔨 ....  Hahaha  Buch of stuff start flying towards Cody and some Ferrari  epic end.  Those videos are so satisfying to watch
His eyes are big asf he definitely on some drugs
How does this only have 200k likes
Bro had a Lamborghini cover on the Ferrari
I have red car and i love how i hate it.
His little racist remark to black folks and their cars is despicable
He's broke he didn't destroy the Bugatti
as a car lover this is very very very hard and painful to watch
Garage door sweating in the background whenever the Ferrari was near it…
Gta Vibes😂🔥
It is like he is playing forza horizon
That bubble thing is gonna sell like crazy after this video damn lol
you should buy a 70 000$ bmw hp4 race and give it away to me. that would really piss of the haters
a horse in the wild 🕊
If anything this should boost Ferraris sales😂🔥 you whipped that thing I wish I had that💯
Road an track published an article on this video. By the amount of hate you got in the comments section, it looks like you should put a blade on the front and do some plowing/landscaping with the world's first super car bulldozer....
Do the other people get to drive it or what
I think he's waiting for a phone call from this one. And if he doesn't get one. Part 2 may be a lot more crazy. He took it easy  but this is a 400k Lawyerari (I'm guessing after legal advice). Honestly a good review for it. I was waiting for parts to break off it. But I'm thinking he wasn't going to show that anyway.
Am buying Ferrari
Whoever makes the car bubble should license part of this video for ads
Who would have guessed the Ferrari was such an off-road beast
Shout out to Doug DeMuro
Careful you might tear a whole in the bubble you idiot
POLSCY JUTUBERZY W 75 % CZASU TRAWANIA TEGO FILMU , DODALI BY MUZYKĘ ZAMIAST D NATURALNEGO DŹWIĘKU FRRRARI.😅😅🤷‍♂️  WITAMY W POLSCE

'Low mileage, lady driver, well maintained' 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Put a two step ! And let it rip
Just another successful hype move
He’s playing Forza Horizon in real life 🤣
Call me a idiot but I think of all the good you could do for people. Like to see you when your 60 yr old
Bros playing Forza horizon 6
When testing a Ferrari for a car magazine, you have to sign a paper stating you WILL NOT take photos of it if it breaks down. This is such next level insecurity
Everyone likes to see car wreck and you sir . Are a huge idiot getting in a car . CONGRATS
I don't get why Ferrari gets their panties in a bunch, if I (cory) paid 400k on a car, I better be able to do what I please to do with my car. Sit down Ferrari, you got your money, let Cody test your car.
The end was hilarious
I’ve never wanted a Ferrari before this but now I might have to sell a kidney or two to get one thanks whistlin diesel
"Ferrari has left the chat"
I was waiting to start hearing gunshots when they started throwing random stuff at the ferarri
You wanna buy me a apartment 😂
Literary forza in rl
Forza horizon IRL
Broh why you got two 911 in the Back
Good lord, I wish Cody would actually get into professional drifting or rally. He's a genuinely good driver - he might oversteer a bit too much, but holy shit, he's pulled off some amazing maneuvers in so many cars, especially in one of his Skylines, on a gravel driveway, or just pavement/offroad/mud/sand/whatever.
🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
Forza in real life
Where do I make pre order my Ferrari mulch?
Not gonna lie my heart kinda hurts from this but I love the content
Vraiment débile !!
I didn't do anything dude 😎
That was a pretty good ad for the car bubble I’ll be honest
6:15 ok some people  (  :
this product is available in India?
Man if you still have that exhaust I'd love to put it on my Integra
I don’t think people realize Ferrari only sues them if the car is cosmetically garbage
Do you want to buy my car and destroy it?
Its amazing how far rich kids will go with daddy’s money to get “likes” on YouTube.  I bet this guy drives a squatted truck in real life.
Hi
Atleast he has a helmet
Can we get WD one of them space suits so he doesn't die?
Dope.
Red is dead
Wild man💪🏼 😂
Honestly I was just as impressed by the bubble shield as I was the Ferrari.
With every second of video this is a slap to Ferrari's Legal Team specially the throwing part🤣🤣
Okay my one question what's up with all the military gear in the background are those empty or naw??
I just can’t stop smiling 😂 omg this has got me rolling into a heart attack 😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤lmfao 😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂❤😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂❤
Idiot........
That's one strong bubble holy shit😂
I remember that my dad taught me this crazy man and I can't stop seeing him thanks to him I have fun with your videos and I had to translate this into English I only know how to speak Spanish greetings

This will probably be the last one he can buy in that price range, I will bet if he’s not on there no sale to list, he will be soon,
WTF is wrong with Americans?!?!?!
What camera where you using when you filmed on the highway?
holy fuck. if anything i just bought one of those car bubbles
You're my fuckin HERO.🤘😈🤘
One day I will have money like this but not to do these things I rather give it to other people if I had it like that
Watch next week's video be Ferrari giving wd a cease and desist over the absolutely wrecked car 🤣🤣🤣 apparently they're almost as bad as the chick who owns the "rights" to the Eleanor mustangs 😒
I would vote for WD to become  President🤣
Oh I really do wonder what Ferrari thinks of this video their probably screaming obscenities in Italian
What are those huge stacks of big cases in the garage, the pelican looking ones?
So what’s the point of all of this???
Bro went too far on this one lmao
Ur  biggest fukn douche bag  because so many people couild actually love to have this car and enjoy it  u need to grow up   Who ever sold u that needs to be slaped
You’re awesome dude 😂😂
This is one of those videos that makes you realize the movie Idiocracy has become reality.  Ferrari should sue him....for defamation as Ferrari does not sue people for what he says they do.   If Enzo were alive and this was the Ferrari of old I suspect he would not have this Ferrari.  But today, any Youtuber / Instagramer with followers is free to prove to the world how classless they really are.   Never before has class and money been so vastly separated as the present era.  Seriously, a douche bag way to treat a car, even more A'holer to treat a car with a prestigious history like Ferrari.  Congratulations to his parents for raiding such a fine young gentleman.
The grass and see me the last video what the hell happened?
Buy a new Ram PowerWagon! It’s indestructible!
Can I buy it for 1$
Wow 😮
I seeee future - i see new homeless
How I feel in forza
give me a hammer
Love it keep up this awesome content eh huh I mean ahhh don't you dare hurt that beautiful car 😉
Welcome to blacklist ferrari
At a certain point his age will catch up to him. Sort of like Jackass stars. They got old and lost the younger generation. He will have to change as time goes on or end up on drugs and die because he can not get any thrills out of life anymore. He reminds me of Bam. He could literally be looking in the mirror at his future.
You make EPiC Videos Bro! See you in Court.
It's about time someone showed Ferrari "F*CKUITSMYMONEYMYCAR" #f*ckurlawers2
Redneck is as redneck does.
This man’s doing gta frfr
that ending was ACTUALLY impressive. lmfao
Like the videos because it shows how American consumerism can be destroyed and the value of an object is based on the market and the individual. On the other hand, I think at this point he could be helping more people out and building a company instead of just doing backwoods I am rich and destroy stuff for fun because it sells.
wtf why did yt un-sub me from wd's channel?
The "bubble" company is probably trying to figure out how to pirate this video to use for their own marketing staregy. I was impressed!
I read the title and instantly said “get ready for the u to get sued for 5mil
Get a Dodge Challenger and destroy it
Do another squated truck video
$2,000 Team Wendy helmet and the $1,000 worth of crye precision clothes nice.
The last thing thrown hade me dying
How to basic But for cars
Nice way to spend money while people in turkey and Syria are suffering
@4:23 You work for 40yrs to have $1m in your retirement, meanwhile some people are putting just $10k in investing coins for just few months and now they are multimillionaires, all thanks to Mrs Julia, God bless you ma 👏
seeing a Ferrari getting absolutely recked is just amusing
But the title said you destroyed it! You better in the next video or I call major click bait
There was a time when I thought this man was crazy for destroying Dior Jordan’s
i bet its a salvage title, or was underwater lol
Oh man. Seeing something trashed so badly which I can’t even dream of 🥲
You’ve convinced at least a handful of people to buy Ferrari after this video so maybe they won’t sue you . 10/10 content .
What's hilarious is that he may be rich but he's so ugly he can't even pull woman. He's a woman's most regrettable one night stand ever😅🤏🏻
Until ferrari banned you to by Ferrari because of that
Dumbest sht iv ever seen people out here starving an a dumb ass is wasting money COOL BRO🤦🙄🤣🤣
I knew this one would be crazy, but didn't think it would be THIS crazy 😂😆😂
Buy a top line Tesla plaid and eff it up. Or race it against anything and watch it win. Then, eff it up.
Maaaannnnnn why did that thing hold up so well😂 when Ferrari has a rally team in 2069, I’m going to think of you Cody, well done sir🍻
well we all know that ferrari is gonna get mad
Now we know the car can last a hurricane or even a crazy hail storm
U could be helping so many people but then again to each idiot their own
The ferrari needs to be put on specialty forged wheels.
f#ck your channel and whatever you stand for you have destroyed a 100 YEARS OF CRAFTSMANSHIP for views you should be ashamed of this and not enjoy the fact you have blown peoples dream cars into shit. congrats on your $600k on this video I didn't even watch a second of it this made me cringe based off of the description.
just want to let ya know that God loves you all, we have to turn from sin and repent before it’s too late, John 14:6 says “I’m the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the father except through me”🙏🏽🤍
Wtf are in all those plastic boxes?
Everything about this hurts my soul
The most painful  video u can watch on youtube
i bet even the ferrari employees watching this vid with joy
I bet you won't take an exotic car to and take over and make them look bad🫠
Lmao it is a safety feature
The car is beautiful
I thought hed at least show himself driving around fast
The bubble company better be sending you a check by the end of the week 🤣
That bubble storage thing was actually strong af wow
Soon as I seen him forcing the bottle down the hood I went to another channel 🫤🥱
That hill climb

You have way to much money
This does hurt but for once I’m glad someone’s standing up
This end up being the best safety Bubble comercial!

Well shi7 give it up for the car bubble.  I'm actually impressed
If anything this is a kick ass advertisement for Ferrari, now the world can see it holds up well to even WD.....for now
the things this man does to make us laugh is insane truly the best content creator of all time

This is the only and first Ferrari doing burnouts the right way 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 yeah not giving a Shiit if you blow it up 😂😂

Lmfao, fuckin  Wild
Bro..... 😂 Ever take it off any sweet jumps?!
To me, it's just stupid what he done, lol.  But it's your car, so do as you feel, but it cost you alot of money. Ferrari are not the only one to do this to  it's customers etc, it's amazing how many brands are out there who do it. Oh well, hope this dude feels good, because Ferrari stock market still going high regardless. If anything, you just proved how good the car is under bad conditions, well done, at your expense 🤣🤣🤣
Why u do t ZELLE me that money and I will not do the same sr please

This guy is playing forza in real life
Bro I’m pretty sure you sold the shit outta that car cover hahah
Got a link for that car bubble? Damn thing is stronger than my parents relationship.
The huracan cover got me weak 💀
You’re the most ungrateful piece of shit I’ve ever seen  You’re a special type of dumbass Damn what an asshole  Fuck you bro
Both the Ferrari and the Bubble held up much better than expected. Thanks for showing us what these machines can really do!
Yo yo yo it’s the car from fortnight
Title of next video- $400,000 Ferrari on buggy wheels goes to town and rips up the field
The ending had me dying. Everything but the kitchen sink. That was hilarious
add buggy wheels plz
you should put on a set of buggy wheels and go to town
Well ... if all else fails , he just gave that protective bubble a glowing review maybe they will pay him .
Damn cody you forgot the kitchen sink
My arm is tired
you should put amish buggy wheels on this like you put on the duramax and the hellcat
Can i have it
Ferrari ?, what ever you paid you got suckered. I wanted to buy one once, so I got a job at a dealership to get a discount. When I saw how they were made, I changed my mind and quit.  I actually told the boss, "take this job and shove it....... I ain't workin' here no more". The look on his face was priceless..
Seeing a Ferrari on a mountain is like catching a legendary Pokemon in a random field
Mans is literally just playing forza with real money
buggy wheels would be awesome on a ferrari
what is the name of that car coger
Can I have the engine at end?
Ferrari has the be the most arrogant car producing entity in the world; these videos will get so many views.
Whoever made that bubble thing just got the best possible advertising for their product and they didn’t have to pay for it
Hey kody 👋. Buy a art piece of me and destroy it on YouTube 🎊😎🤙🎉
this would be sick with a set of buggy wheels
put buggy wheels on this
Idea: Use a Rolls Royce Cullinan to pull lawnmower trailer and go cut grass
This is some TaxTheRich100 type shit
OMG
Te mamaste!! 😂😂😂
Next time we need a LaFerrari 😁
@1:23 why do people hate you when you are just so...
do a Tesla next... they MUST have more lawsuits than Ferrari. Musk's ego is more fragile than a 9 yo girl's.
Cody we need a competition in like a WRX up the rally driveway
Best ending ever lmao
the only man to see it raining and go lets go drift my Fucking ferrari hell yea!!!
Clickbait video. Title implies something like a monster truck will drive over it.
That thing might make thru the mud hole at the old place.
Now we need to see if the Bubble can hold up to the 50call lol
Bro hopped on forza
LMFAO!! All the shit being thrown at it was hilarious! You’re my hero!
gotta take it to silver lake

The power of a knife is all it takes, stupid idea.
You’re basically the “will it blend?” Channel of exotic vehicles
this has to be the rarest Farrari footage ever
Can i pls have after ur done breakin it i promise to take good care of it
He should make this a baja style 💀. Like lambo made
I'm so waiting on the "destroying a Bugatti" video. I'm not sure if you could go any higher than that. You're awesome man. Keep doing your thing.
The ending 😭😭😭
Cut a sun roof in. Perfection.
You forgot to throw the kitchen sink
Douche bag
My dad has dreamed of owning a Ferrari since he was a child. I will not be showing him this video.
Definitely a car and brand I understand destroying cause fuck Ferrari and their bullshit mentality
Cody's about to give Ferrari a lesson on what it means to live in a Republic
12:09 product review
Give me a hammer lmao 13:18
I laughed so hard
You should take it to the shooting range. Then go to the dealership and tell them the car was at the shooting range, and obviously the the car will have numerous aftermarket holes.
Needs a driver mod a Amish mod
Hey @WhistlinDiesel you wanna help my life and just gimme 150k so I can restart my life in another state with no snow? I mean i feel like i would be very grateful. You’d always be invited to the bbqs my dude.
Ferrari can’t be mad tho I’m impressed I’m sure they are too 😂
Need for speed hot pursuit in life!
What a dog lmaooooo
It’s great!🎉
Hate Ferraris with passion. You made me very happy.
Lmao 😂
Anyone else impressed with how well it did on pretty much everything and held up too?
Amazing commercial for the bubble, they should have hired you instead!
That’s what real entertainment is folks, that shit right here , love it!!!
KITCHEN SINK PROOF?
The final part just like avengers assemble thing 🤣👌🏻 waiting for the flame test  🔥
This honestly makes me question my previous thought about Ferrari, im very impressed and kinda want one now
Mans playing forza irl
Forza Horizon Vibes 🤣
What they don’t show you behind the scenes he has all his female employees toss all the crap on his Ferrari bubble. That’s why it passed the durability test.
f1 car durability test
That ending makes we want my own out of stock white bubble
Tank durability?
Where is the tank cody
forza horizon in real life lol
I somehow disliked the Skyline video in a way, but am absolutely loving this 😂🤣
i was gunna say garbage.
This dude has the best legal team known to man!!!! Keep up the amazing videos Whistlin!
You are sick I love it😂
Me in for a horizon 😂
I wonder how many people are cringing and crying I love it. People don't realize it wislen diesel feeds off the tears in the anguish of  haters and butthurt crybabies it's his fuel.
Duuude every single car he owns he wrecks into somthing
🤣🤣
Straight up playing gta
Look at you out here doin' the Lord's work! =)
Where is the Bugatti test 😂
This man spends his money wisely!! Bravo sir 👏
I am still waiting for the red Ford Raptor to fly.
I was more worried about the Hilux at the start 😂
WD, you're doing such a great job calling out the BS of reputation for a lot of products...  I think it's time you durability tested a Duesenberg. After all, people keep saying everything modern isn't 'made like it used to be'.   I feel like the machine that inspired the phrase 'its a doozie' deserves being used as the ultimate expression of that claim. F*** yeah I'm serious. If a Duesenberg was to be destroyed, I'd want it done at the hands of WD instead of anyone else.
I just love the fact that rich American dentists and international oil consultants are watching this dude with envy, thinking about how they can try to one up him to be cool for their kids.
I bet you he won’t do it with the Bugatti
Just need a few energy drink stickers on that hooptie, and you have Gymkhana 2023. Nice!
Lmao he can’t control rwd…..
Damn, man.  I'm glad to see another video from you. I thought you got thrown in jail or something...  It always makes my night to see a whistlin diesel video of tearing up shit 🤘
🤣
Good shit lol
I smile every time whistlen diesel makes a video this man is w riz
When is the tank coming home
comn throw a truck tire at it and a leaf spring or five (not a pick-up tire)
i will buy this ferrari for $5. Your next video is going to be titled “I sold my $400.000 Ferrari for $5”
Children in Africa could have eaten that ferrari
You need to buy Leroy from cleetus and give it a “durability test “😂😂
Ferrari??? This is a work truck.
Whose shop??
Does anyone else just stop to appreciate how good WD is at driving? Like fr
😂
what is his merch store name
Rip a Pigani on the same course.
like a little kid playing forza :D
My emotions are so mixed about this video. I am a fan, but I am also an old guy who had to work his whole life to get a Ferrari. Your brand is irreverence and I get it. I don't think I like it, but I can stop watching. Fuck it. Do your thang.
Car Bubble Sales After This Video 📈📈
Ferrari is best off-road car
I can die now, and I'd have zero complaints.
Well this is a pretty good ad for that bubble at the end lmao
Literally I just imagined Playing GTA when he was driving it up that hill
I can’t wait until you do the cybertruck after you can get one.
This video is the definition of letting the intrusive thoughts win and I'm all for it 😂
Ferrari: ya wey yaaaaa
Video looks fake af 😂
Love this guy
Bro is playing forza in real life
Tanta gente necesitada y estos hijos de putas destruyendo carros de millones
Have you did any good thing with a Tesla
Please make a part 2, its still in pristine condition in WhistlinDiesel standards.
Technically click bait bc he didn’t really destroy it. (Thank God) 😂
Nobody has more step ladder than WD
One hell of an ad for that bubble storage.
Best video ever
That suspension is amazing
Can I buy what is left of it? Please then I can take care of it 😂
Well shit I'm convinced to buy one now lol. Thanks for the ad I guess
POV forza
Bro is playing forza 5 irl trying to complete a drift zone
Actually, I haven’t seen a Ferrari tow a monster max before. That’ll be cool to see one day.
You can make videos without spending 200k on damaging something
Dang that car condom is one tuff sob !
The ending had me rolling
Man's playing Forza Horizon in real life
This man is living the dream…doing things we can only dream of!

This is real life Forza Horizon!
There next slogan "Ferrari, we sue our custumers"

9:08 bro what-
Yo dad can I have the motor lol
you should do a hover board durability test
1:45 Ferrari Enzo 1:400 crashed into a tree. This literally happened during a testride from the dealership. 💀
Let’s see if I destroy something American legendary products or whatever how you feel
In other news, all those bubbles are sold out, and all of the next batch.  All colors
Bro drives it like he in forza 😂
Bro had me fucking dying
THIS HURT ME OML XD
bro you are turning into Rick from Rick & Morty 😈😈😈
If you’re paying $400,000 for a car, you better be able to do what you want with it.
This car could’ve made a sick ass track day with the boys
Bro is gonna get assasinated
That’s a great way to advertise the bubble😂
This is just Beamng at this point 😂
Impressive bubble 💯 I need one bc unlike Cody I can't afford damage to my El Camino. She's been my daily driver for 5 years & hopefully I can keep it driving another 43 years since it's an 80 model.
bros gonna be broke next year💀💀
What is in all the foot lockers? In the background
i meannnn if you wanna buy a $400,000 ferrari to destroy it you could also get me a $25,000 brz🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️i turn 16 in april and i’m about to have my license 😅😅😅 you could also make it a video “Buying a $25,000 BRZ for my subscribers Birthday”😂😂 has a nice ring to it🤔
if you dont like ima tell ya moms
Idk about the Ferrari but buy the stocks of that god damn cover company
Honestly should use a corner slide shot as a ad cover would look sick
How fun to be able to do shit like this, good for him. Look at that smile, priceless!
First watch, can't wait to see this decent young man enjoy some of the finer things in life. He looks like he'll really value the importance of this car.
Are you actually gonna destroy it this was just some pussi shi
take it to a ferrari dealer all trashed and see what they say about the codes - have them give you an estimate once you're done "playing" with it lol
Car bubble sales after this📈
Hater: why do you destroy nice cars you: THATS WHAT I DO
Ferrari is having a mental breakdown after seeing this
This hurts but it’s funny
You threw rocks at the camera that's land splashing
Ferrari is malding
that’s how i be in gta
A super fast or f12 would have been way more epic
lol bro is gonna get a cease and desist 😂
Hell yeah 😂
Reminds me of the movie Speed Zone.  1989, if you haven't seen it,  watch it! I wish you skipped it across a pond!
He’s playing forza bro I swear lol
Forza 5 in real life. Great video

Forza in real life:
Try a kitchen sink😃
*Give me a hammer* Proceeds' to get thrown half of the warehouse
Forza IRL
That should be paid partner ship from that company for the bubble
I love Ferrari but stupid laws have given them too much liberty and that needs to change. What I buy with my money belongs to ME Point blank.
13:18 reminded me of Wrench Fight...ahhh good times.
The shit being thrown at the bubble was the best part lol.  Should have a race against the charger on a dirt track dukes of hazard style lol
Ferrari= shit company, shit founder, shit cars, shit racers... ;-)
Do this kinda stuff in gta all the time
Well , this wasn’t at all what I was expecting
Wow, so amazing 🤐😱🤣🤫🧐💪🐐
Next Up: I got a cease and desist letter from ferrari...
Just sad to see such a moron with too much money destroy something he most likely knows nothing about....and no I did not watch this entire video. Trash.
Congratulations
Forza Horizon in real life

Cody you should sign for hoonigan
Fawk you.  I'm first
An idiot
Can’t Cease and Desist when the car doesn’t exist
This video cured my depression!!!!!
That shit is ceramic coated
the lambo cover over the ferrari was making my head spin
This was pretty phucked up...still grinnin'. 😀 I paid less for my house than you did for this car...it did make a cool field/drift car. The protective bubble was pretty funny, held up well.
I remember watching that video with the white work truck…
Imagine this with a bugutati
Let’s see a tavarish rebuild on this after your done with it
How about a snow plow? Italian Duke boys very hairy but have a Ferrari.
Real life Forza 😂
They'll never let you buy a Ferrari again
and your tearing up a car i could only dream to own... sweet
Great video, if you don’t like the car that much you can just send it to me or just send me the parts that fall off after your done with it lol 👍😃🇬🇧
you are a idiot!
Let's see you off-road a Rolls Royce next! 🤔😈
Logic stop fucking around
That was so much better than I could have ever hoped for. I laughed so hard, I wanted to call Ferrari's legal team myself
I can't belive you didn't make sure the car bubble wasn't bullet proof smh
okay this is dope tho
When you go off the road in forza
This is literally me on forza horizon 5 😂
7:18 IS THAT A LICENSE PLATE I SEE??? HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
Lucky you bro that can throw money like that with $400k I paid of my house and I yuck trucking
Whistlin diesel lowkey is a good driver lol I was impressed with his drifting and handling skills tbh
Dude, I wish I had any of this shit that you destroyed, but hey, Duck it, I didn't buy it. DESTROY THAT SHIP!!
I’m not the only one who also wants to do the same thing right like he is having a blast!!
Forza in real life.
You are one sick individual!!! Your the only damn person in this world that will do this kind of shit to a Ferrari and everything else youve done! Thank god for whistlin diesel!
Wait... You didn't even hurt that Ferrari... I WANT A FERRARI NOW
You forgot to throw a midget🙊
Where was the kitchen sink
13:18 my jaw dropped while seeing this part
Chinese spy ballon. 💀
It's a good advertisement for the car bubble
So I need insurance claim Insurance company after seeing this-:
He’s looking like a gta v online character with the camo gear and sports car😂
We all know Cody and his viewers are going to get the moneys worth of content out of this Ferrari. This is the first durability test but definitely not the last 😅
This is some of the funniest content I've ever seen.... Thank you!
Ferrari stock just shot up.
I can only imagine what Ferrari is going to do after seeing this 🤣 they will be so butthurt
Fr i dont understand the hate he gets. Like Im a car guy and even tho its making me cringe a bit seeing him destroy this f8, I find it somehow funny how he just doesnt care lmao
I accidentally laughed more than I thought was possible.
Absolutely dominating YouTube early in 2023. Shop is looking great so far too.   Keep it up man and remember no splashing! ❤
There are people who CAN'T afford a car.
A Ferrari cumming it's brains out as it's the first one off the assembly line to get the shit rode out of it in over 50 years, like they were meant to be driven back in the 50's
Foreigners* would pay top price of $50 each for those converters 🤣🤣
Usen condon para evitar que nazcan idiotas como este
forza horizon 4 For yo Asss 🤣
why doesnt it have tracks and a snowplower ?
the “tHIs” from demuro took me out😭😂
The Farrari 308 gt was used as a rally car and the Lancia Stratos was basically a Farrari 💯🤙👌
More!
This video was soo good!
Good to now brother! Fuck that shit! Freedom is everything!!!
It'll buff out.
Hopefully this ends up like the Hilux durability test.

They gonna blacklist him and not sell him another one again
who's the fat blonde kid and why does he think he can tell you to stop
Yesss dawggggg that bitchhh😂
Got watch this video before the court other  for it to be removed.Never laughed so hard for a very expensive car being destroyed. If it was any other car I would if cried, but who cares about Ferrari.
change that thumbnail you look like the buffalo supermarket shooter
13:25 great add for the bubble protecting the ferrari
You should take this thing rock climbing
Little did we know that the air flow hole on the hood is actually a toilet 😎
My man is playing gta in real life on mount chiliad
I hate whistling diesel. This kid pusses me off
Next test bugatti chiron
I was waiting for the kitchen sink at the end
Disappointing not to see a Ferrari being destroyed
When he jumped into the trunk I almost pissed myself 🤣
Who knew Ferraris were so good off-road
😮
He was like with that Ferrari
bro was playing forza horizon 5 irl
You forgot to throw the kitchen sink at it.
nice team wendy helmet im one of the designers of it
The fact that Doug DeMuro’s “Thisss” catchphrase is a meme in the car YouTuber community makes me happy to be a car enthusiast
This is the pinnacle of YouTube.
gta5 taught me that  super cars the the best for hill climbs
Whistlindiesel: *pulling the seat back and forth*            "stop"
I hate you and love you at the same time! My dream car! And in my dream I would dream of being able to rally the S#@t out of it! Not given a @$$## is on a new level watching your vids. Keep them coming!
Lawyer going to be contacting him soon I bet. They don’t mess around as a brand
This is my second time watching this 😂 love it!

Tug of war between g wagon and the Ferrari😂😅

Damn I’m broke
Needs a cummins!
Every time I click on one of your videos I think to myself, "sure, I'll watch this idiot destroy something". Then I remember that if I had the means, I would also be that idiot. Absolutely love how offensive you are!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣❤
Making me proud boy ☆
The gun shots cracked me up.
13:40 I thought at the end of this you’d hit it with a round from your tank… blow up half the shop.. disappointed
painful to watch , but definitely enjoyed watching him slide around the dirt and gravel
What's with all the military cases stacked on the wall? 🤔
13:20 😂🤣
Ur listening to him and u can see he’s taking directly to Ferrari that he doesn’t care!😂
Alternative title   how to get sued by ferrari: beginners guide
can they sue you if you haven't sign anything ? I mean it's not a software, you bought the car itself, not a licence to use it in a certain way (If they make you sign something, you can just buy the car 2nd hand from a 3rd party, it's not like the f8 is a limited unobtainium grade hypercar)
This is the funniest video I’ve seen in a long time 😂
why? you are an complete idiot.
I wanna know how many people went and bought that bubble after seeing this video because…….Damn. That thing held up lmfao😂
Glad I’m seeing this now before anyone with legal privilege decides to tell you to take it down
😭😅😅🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣this air bubble has to be a sponsor kmsl
Tu es vraiment dans le top 10 des trous du cul américains mon gars

So many ladders
8:00 this is me in Forza.
Man’s playin forza 5 irl
real life Forza horizon
This guy is now on a Ferrari watch list
Besides natural sense of cringe of seeing a nice car getting potential destroyed or damaged; I loved thinking of the of the faces of the people who it would likely offend most.  Ferrari and it's snobby owners. Fuck em.
Probably the absolute best ferrari advertisement anywhere in the world. This thing did awesome 👌
Lamborghini car cover for it was a fantastic choice lol.
Konesegg durability test
Ferrari after possibly winning this law suit “I got 1234567 m’s in my bank account m’s in my bank account”
I saw the end part of this in some meme compilation and never knew it was from WhistlinDiesel, wish people wouldn't steal clips from this guy.
Shout out to the bubble.

I genuine look forward to codys vids.

This guy has advice for Cody: https://youtu.be/n9XVFWGjaLw
Will it skip across a pond ??
This guy is playing BeamNG irl
You never seem to amaze me bro.  Love the way you feed off the haters.  Keep it up Cody.
what if with a simple knife or even key someone punches the inflatable thingy?
Best video in forever !
Ferrari mulch might be the closest I will get to owning a Ferrari so this business model checks out.
Finally we have a new Tax the rich 1000
@tax the rich would be proud
Ferrari are currently having crisis meetings over this😂
Holy SHiiit I am buying one of those car bubbles.
Couldn’t stand watching you when I first saw your videos but overtime I’ve grown to love your absolute lack of fu*ks given. Well played and keep up the good work.
I cried 😭 when I watched this diesel please please please if you don't want this car I would love to have it
Real life Forza Horizon 5
This is literally gta 😂
When you try to be funny, but you’re just dumb and cheesy.
if that wasn't an advert for the bubble thing than i don't know what is
Lmao Savage !!!
This is me in FH5 when I’m bored
nah 3:19 took my soul 😂🤣🤣
Wild thing is the views and likes and traffic on this video can buy another one
I've never had a video regarding crashing a car make me feel the way this one has. Supras, other Ferraris, Lambos, whatever, and this is the only time I naturally reacted and yelled you monster! Hahaha.
Dam I thought he was gonna do worse .... lol
That last portion of the videos was hilarious 😂. You should incorporate SpongeBob clips in your videos, season 1-3! So much good content!
Think it need wooden Amish buggy wheels
Il est perdu Le gars ....aucun intérêt...une bonne pub pour Ferrari malgré qu'il ne veulent pas
honestly my favorite video thus far. very classy
From like 6:18 to 8:24. all I could think was.  «Thats so GTA dude»
Dumb f4ck... This is what is happening when you don't work for your money
Yes, lift that bitch up
Put the bubble in water with a car in it to see if it's flood safe
awesome video
Rallyrrari or ferally 😂
This guys doesn’t care about money, he cares about himself
Do a Bugatti
Hello, I’m calling about your car’s expiring warranty 🤣
Bro playing forza

Baller.
ever heard of slander
Has Ferrari put you on the naughty list or tried to sue you? ….or do they only sue the owners of cat NFT Ferraris
Nearly 200k likes and not a single dislike😁😁
I am so thankful for these videos. I laughed so hard. As time goes by these remain the same pure fun and joy. Thank you !!!
I am a big fan of your videos I love destroy stuff my dad has a van that if you buy it you can destroy it and I a peace of shit I would love to come out and destroy stuff with you
Ferrari pov pursuing you for $2 million dollars him double and pass it on to the next guy

He can't keep getting away with this!😎
Me on gta lmao
Liking before  I watch bc you always deliver
Awful and wonderful is hard to do but you've done it. Hats off.
ma che cazzo ? Vaffanculo
Can we take a moment to appreciate how good of a driver this man is
Lmfao.. someone threw a rc car 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love a Ferrari as much as the next but this is surprisingly satisfying
And before the Cease and desist
Ferrari owners should be required to watch this video to encourage them to go out and have fun driving. Hey, that bubble thing is really awesome. It's like a Star Trek force field.
Lift that motha fucker 😂
A few days later, that company is using your video as an ad to keep your Ferrari safe 😄
Doug dub was the best
Youre to big off a pussy bich to actualy distroit like the f350
But like he’s actually a pretty decent driver
Hey Cody! I left my position with Mercedes Benz to start a small business doing foreign car repairs and upgrades. We would love to come do some upgrades on your next project in exchange for a shoutout for the business. Like this comment so it can be seen!!
All you need now is to buy a Bugatti into the same stuff 😂😂
Why this mans always so sweaty 😂🥵
Me in Forza just came to life
Thanks for beating on a car only wealthy athletes, Wall Street executives, and the political class buy.  Made me smile.  Subbed
Hands down coolest channel on YouTube, low-key glad this wasn't the fate of your huracan
😂😂😂😂😂🙌🙌🙌
Man I get heart attack entire time
Dudes driving like he’s in forza
Please do tesla durability test then blow it up with a tank and dynamite  ⬇️
This is your reminder that all your sinful ways are nothing compare to the the love, freedom, and eternal life you can receive from God and no matter how much you think it’s to late to be forgiven remember that as long as you try your best to fallow Jesus and repent you will be forgiven and Jesus will carry you on the right path
This is me in Forza Horizon
Thank you 🙏🏼 I Thoroughly enjoy that
Mans playing forza horizon irl
Shouldve squatted the hell outta this Rari 😂

BEST REVIEW OF FERERIE FAiRY NAFF CARS.....EXCELLENT!!! 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾🤣
Hopefully farrai does sue him, that way he can spend that money on the case and become bankrupt afterwards then realize he’s a pos
Huge WD fan, but this one might hurt a little. Then again interested to see how a Ferrari holds up to everyday activities that all of us do everyday.😅😅
my man out here proving Ferraris are made well and will def get sued
You slow asf
I love how we get a whole 52 seconds of them just throwing stuff at it
Only is instead you could just give my mom 20k and she would be good for life
squat it
Can you name the cars before you kill them and then put the tombstone with said name and have a little grave yard   That would look so cool / creepy on ur property
I bet when you destroyed your first expensive truck you didn't think you would mess up a Ferrari.
man this guy bought it with his own money how dare you do what you want with it. sue him
I think that’s not fun. It’s just sad. No matter how much money do you have, a car enthusiast will never do this.
Hey WhistlinDiesel, could I sit in your car bubble while u guys throw shit at the car, I’ll give u 5$
Can't understand why they sue people. At the end of the day you purchased it therefore you own it
Is that one of the models Ferrari has to vet you before you are allowed to buy one?
Great Video!
Will the Buble work outside? In the Netherlands where it rains? Hails? Freeze every once in while?  And where it is moist always?
great concept
Nice Fiat
Fuck Ferrari!!!!!!!!!
These videos are getting soooo expensive that you only upload once a month
Watching your videos is like watching my dreams in real life.
That's a Farari Kit Car, calm your tits Ferrari
just tell them you wanted to play forza horizon for real when they come sue you haha
this video made me laugh out loud
Top vid. And is there anything in the world that you wouldn’t smash up
16lb sledgehammer throw! But that bubble was a better buy than the car!! But I think you should enter the Baja 1000 with it!!
This is literally the best advertisement Ferrari could ever hope for 😂
I say the best part of this entire show is when you guys started throwing everything at the Ferrari whoever thought of that give him a dollar lol
Not all heroes wear cape
Nothing looks better than a red Ferrari off-roading
7:31 😭😂😂😂😂😂💀💀💀💀💀
I felt such joy the whole time watching this video, and i'm glad that i got to see it before they try to take this down and realize that once it's on the internet, it's there for good😁
I can’t wait til those Ferrari dudes get their panties all bunched up  Most excellent Sir  😅😂🤣🙏😎🤙
Got scammed someone just said I won a truck
That was honestly a fantastic ad for the bubble company
That was fucking awesome 👌 lol
this reminded me of that youtube channel called " taxtherich100" rallying ..  I bet Ed Bolian from #vinwiki is smiling lol
Bubble stock went up 🔝
❤❤❤❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥✅✅✅✅✅
Man I got sued for thinking about watching this video a second time haha #lawsuit #ponyshow
After seeing how it handles in the dirt, It makes me wonder why farrier doesn't revive the Lancia name and just sell lifted re-badged versions of there cars.
Real life GTA
Forza life
Se Ferrari vede questo video non potrai più comprare una Ferrari nuova
Whistlin, you inspired me to take my f8 off-road as well so i will do It tonight in forza horizon 5
This dude is top 3 trending right now
That was hilarious at the end lmfao
Definitely reminds me of @TaxTheRich100
The ending was gold 😂
That was a incredible ad for that car cover lol
Oh yeah. Bet you won’t buy me my first car😂😂
I wanna see what happens if you put diesel in that Ferrari
This was more a durability test for the bubble not the Ferrari😂😂
bro got a free promotion video for his car wrap
this is probably the happiest ferarri ever has seen more action in 13min than any other ferarri ever
mans left the tow hook in the whole time lol
Bro this is an ad for that bubble
Dads approve of this channel 👍🏼
This has to be my favorite video by you, had me laughing the whole time
Wow, that was painful. Anyways, can you PLEASE destroy your excavator or tank?! Please and thank you.
bro has an license plate on half of the edits 2t7rsx
I dream of whats in the pelican cases.
Heyyy I could use a ferrari f8 tributo
Was expecting a lot more to be honest.
They deserve this for sueing customers in the first place
Congratulations brother.  On the new entertainment purchase stretch this one out a little longer I would like to see a little more of it please. Also Ferrari has put up a fight with everyone but now they have met their maker Hi it is you.🤣🥰
Forza horizon in real life part 1
I'm going to have to unsub after seeing this

I mean. I really can't get enought of it maybe a Bugatti next 😉
One of your best videos, keep going 💪 👍🏿
Waiting for the cease and desist 😂😂
You should see if it’s bulletproof
this should be a sponsorship video for ferrarri
bro is the next taxtherich
Your dad's gonna kill you for doing that to his grass and ferrari 😠
You guys are awesome lmfao
we love to see it
HILUX IT!  (run it over with a Hilux)
the guy from the lamborghini shop's look just slayed me
THE GUNSHOTS LMAOOOO
You just gave them the commercial to show off the car bubble!
The bubbly was impressive
Yo the air compressor part got me rolling 3:15
I haven’t even started the video and I know man’s is never getting another Ferrari
that bubble actually op
Hahaha haha
WhistlinDiesel one day (Earth durability test)
You guys are deranged! This is not even funny...really! Stop it! Its wrong! Go talk to somebody! A psychiatrist or something...We all have childhood sequelae...but man! You were really mistreated back then.
I was waiting for a bullet to hit the bubble 🤣🤣
The bubble is the only item that’s been Whistlin diesel proof 🤣🤣
Bro literally playing forza horizon in rl 😂
Can't wait for you to take your new Ferrari SUV on road!
Whistlindiesel reminds me of a more country raised mrbeast with a extra extra hint of passion for destruction. And he's one of few channels that make content like this that didn't copy mrbeast lol
LIFT KIT AND MONSTER TRUCK WHEELS WOULD BE THE DREAM !!!
13:17 𝕚𝕤 𝕥𝕙𝕚𝕤 𝕒 𝕔𝕒𝕣𝕥𝕠𝕠𝕟 😂🤣
13:20 bro went to a goodwill and bought the most random shi 😂😂
what a nice place you build for yourself, i love it!!
Run it over with monster max 2
Ferrari always talks about their brand. Enzo Ferrari didn't care about a company he wanted to race fast cars and couldn't without a company. Whoever is currenly in charge is diminishing the Ferrari name
Feraris could be cool, but ferari is gay and doesnt let you even have fun in their cars. All they are meant for was to be loud and driven like a honda accord by grandpas that dont speed
Haven't watched and  I already like it
Que pena ver un Ferrari en manos de semejante personaje y que pena que semejante retrasado se gane la vida con esto
you have fun with very little I would say... Provoke Ferrari, destroing a Ferrari? Wow! So rebel and revolutionary.
Oh nice another person that will be banned by Ferrari XD
Imagine being the dude that bought that exhaust, all on the car in the driveway, then watching the video of WD scooting it all off a table onto the concrete floor lmaoo
Next episode: The US AIR FORCE SHOOTS DOWN MY FARRERI
Do Rimac next!!!
Guess who got their tax returns back 🤣
That $400k price does not include lawyer so basically it is a $450k car
You gotta get cars that people died in our something that’s a lot of money to spend on a shitty car from a shitty car company
Two million years later....
Now that was some cool shit 😎 👌
Honestly a good commercial for the bubble!
Yooo the graphics of the new Forza Horizon looking good 👌
Forza Horizon in real life
You need to slowly drive through a thorn bush
Keep ‘em coming bud !  Love this shit!!!
What a shame. I guess that's what you get when your generation eats tide pods. What a waste.
is that TJ Hunts Huracan in the background?
You could do so much good for other people with your money and popularity. You bought a toy, broke it, and you showed it to the world. Your parents must be proud.
supercar demolition derby when?
Please make a part 2
Ferrari bout to send a “cease this is too sick”
You better let the bubble company use that for a commercial holy shit thats gold
I don’t want to talk to your bank after buying this car 😂
he needs to get it as close to totaled as possible then go through a valet service somewhere high end LMAO
❤❤❤
I think that was just enough to not get sued as fuck. Let's see tho :D
Need to do a drop test 100ft sounds about right 🤣
Nobody on this earth deserves fuck you money as much as cody does…. This shit so gold it’s like king Midas himself reached up our anus and blessed our colon himself!
All I can say is lots of wheel spacers and some dumb big wheels like you use to do would be funny
GTA was right after all about supercar off-roading
His little edited in memes are getting better😂
Thank you for service 🏇
I fooking love this video 👙😲
Showed that last scene to a buddy, his immediate BIG BRAIN response, "throw a sword or sharp object at it and let's see if it pops"
This video will be use as advertising for both the bubble maker and ferrari
Bro’s playing Forza Horizon in real life 😭
I absolutely fucking love this channel
everything ive done in forza but just real life!
Shit you need to get paid for advertising for that blow up car cover haha 😂
the sales for the car protector increased by 1500% after this video
Cody reminds me of someone on Forza Horizon
PlEaSe mAkE a FerRarI oFfRoaD SidEbYsIdE
Glad I could see this day come
I wish to achieve this level of freedom….
The Ferrari is fake evidence  https://youtu.be/P1pOCubD3FY
So driving off-road in a super car in GTA can be called realistic now lol
y’all better watch this before it gets taken down
😂😂😂😂 everything you should do to your Ferrari
Lmfao
The last part was the best for me
This is what i do in GTA tho, mans lucky as hell.
man i loved this video, looking forward to more with this Ferrari...the ending was sick💀👌
It’s a fake Ferrari evidence here   https://youtu.be/P1pOCubD3FY
Greatest video I’ve watched in a long time it actually made me happy and I’m sad 😢 that it’s over now Part 2 Maybe???
we need to be really clear in times of political correctness dude! you are an idiot. and you bringing shame to your family.  What you are doing is a pure evil thing against the human art of work and effort.  Also, you think only about yourself and you click bites.  I can't imagine how stupid and twisted you are. shame you PURE ACT OF VANDALISM.   If you don't understand why Ferrari is able to sue customers? again you are an idiot -  could you imagine burning Picasso's painting? with all those movies you just want to help yourself, not the community or anyone. you are the kind of type of person who needs to turn the camera on when you buy a burger for the homeless.
I'd probably be doing this same type of sh*t if I was Rich why not right?
Hahahahaha I have no shit been smiling the entire time lmao
Loved the video
fyi the ferrari has complete PPF so the paint is not really getting chipped or scratched
GTA in real life
Good, looking forward to seeing Ferrari get mad.
Ferrari right now : 👴
The last bubble part had me dead 😭
Should’ve tried a nail gun
Hes playing FH5  in real life👌👌
Need for speed feelings are coming up there
Ouch...but I love it!
13:18 have fun cleaning all that😭
Cory needs professional Help ,  we so enjoy his mental state
This hurts my heart
Cody, we are all here for you to help you with the lawsuit!
One of those hard to watch videos but it was great lol
That bubble could handle the weight of all your haters moms!
This video gave me anxiety lol
The new forms looks great!
its aii, bor just playing forza
Love to see this car drive how it’s meant to be driven
I'm surprised Ferrari let him buy this usually they make you buy a shitty Ferrari before you get a nice one
me in gta:
I'm not gonna lie, that's so cool
One of those videos you have to rewatch
Yes!!
Get emmmmm
Yo ar sik pro😅
This needs some mud terrains and a long travel coil over kit! 🤠🤣
Um I was expecting him to destroy it why didn't he destroy it.   Go top speed and dump molten glass on it right at top speed
Pretty sure the Ferrari executives are having a meeting due to this😂
STOP FRICKING BUYING EXPENSIVE THINGS TO DESTROY AND SAVE UP FOR A BUGATTI
Your one of my favorite channels but this honestly is hurting to watch lol
13:19 😂😂😂😂
Well the car bubble guy was the only guy who got a W from this video LMFAO
💔oh myyy
Such a good sounding car
I was waiting for a sink at the end 😂
That sounds so good ripping through the wood
I’m in tears😭😭😭 GOD I wish I could afford to do this
Love seeing this done in a Ferrari
if i had the mony for this car it would be axactly how i would use it
the baja rey being thrown at the car took me out 😂😂😂
I am so amazed by how well it did off road.
This hurts so bad
A neck has never been redder than this Ferrari
Butt hole pucker factor 100000. I know what’s going to happen sooner or later but it’s still pretty funny. 😂
Ferrari will never allow you to buy another one
monstermax swap
Damn good video
Amazing. What Ferrari really cares about though is mods, I've always wanted to get one just to chop it up and turn it into an offroad beast. Can't wait to see what you do next
O melhor vídeo de sempre 😁🤣🤣🤣 quase que morri de tanto rir ... E não é que o Ferrari até se safa muito bem em modo rally  lol .
What's in all those cases
America
Went it wanting to gate this video… but ended up cracking up the whole way through. Bravo. How about a Lamborghini towing test next?
Clean ferrari😐dirty ferrari😆🥳
Ur, I think that you may be a little confused about the difference between copyrights and trademarks.
1 min throwing time, 1 hour cleanup lmao
Best bubble advert ever
You grandsons will also get sued for this video
The best part was when he crushed the car with the big excavator
This is a better ferrari ad than anything else
YEAAAH F*CK FERRARI!!!
I thought driving my supercar offroad in GTA5 was crazy but this is mind blowing.😮
Im so happy there is a Cody in the world that will do these things.
🤣🤣🤣 how many mfs you had behind the camera throwing shit?!
me in forza
7:30 When he slapped the steering wheel, I immediately thought of that clip where the kid crashed it and the airbags just came out. Then boom, there it is, the clip in the video. Whoever is the editor is goated for that lol
AMA: How to get blacklisted by Ferrari.
The old style is the best
Disappointing. Destroy it… let me make sure you read this right. DESTROY… it.
That was so funny, I laughed the whole time.. gg
Haha 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This was 14 minutes of gold.
i hope i get rich enough to do stuff like this
Please for the love of god kody if you see this comment. Get a koenigsegg.
Lamborghini engine swap it and drag the Rari engine behind the car
that ferrari wanted level took me out
I was expecting a lifted Ferrari in a rally race disappointed...
Playing forza horizon irl
That drift was slick bro
Ferrari go sew him 💀
This dudes playing Forza in real life
13:28 Bro threw everything around him at the bubble
Pleasantly surprised he didn’t destroy that beautiful car
Sweet. Made number 3 on trending.  "It was wearing a red shirt, Jim. He was destined to die there." Looks like you had a blast. Golf Claps.
The driving reminds me of taxtherich, he used to drive his cars like this. Amazing.
Hope whoever made that car bubble sponsored you lol
Man is going to do this to a Bugatti, so I see no problem here.
Best ad ever made for that bubble 😂
This man Is going to be on ferrari kill list...
Ele vai destruir a Ferrari
That bubble was very impressive
This video hurts less since it's not a real Ferrari.  Real Ferraris don't have turbo kits strapped on them
OK tbh this guy has a nice grip👌
this is to hard to watch
Bro out here playing Forza in real life 😄 love it!
You could have gave it to me I need a new car bro dang
Total idiot
Wasnt this guy in debt like 4 months ago
Where do you buy his merch?
This is why he’s the goat
The guy at the shop here saw me watching this and he was giving me that side eye look like no he didn’t and I’m over here like throw cinder blocks on to it throw another car on it
6:43 give me this duck
What is in all that transportation boxes?
I love cars,  so it was painful in a way to watch, but I laughed and smiled a lot too.   Weird
Try to break the Land Cruiser behind u
When you were throwing everything at the bubble... I couldn't help but think, "Well, that's everything, but the kitchen sink!".... I WAS HANGING OUT WAITING FOR THE KITCHEN SINK!! :D
Wowww
Cody this is quite a thing in UK https://youtu.be/Inp-SOiFKNc old cars doing rocky hill climbing

Why do you care so much about what people say in the comments?
YouTube Demo king

https://youtu.be/MjK3S_GgUig

forza horizon 6 looks sick
You doin Mark McCann proud back in England
Hello whistlingdiesel thank you for motivating me to destroy my house and my parents vehicles, they are now in debt and they kicked me out of my home. Love the content btw 😅💯
Wow, I wish I was gay
No fucking way dude lol holy shit.
Just Yes!!!!
I love this kid! if he was my accident, I would be proud!

Let's GOOOOO! Cant wait for the next episode...
Only an idiot with a lot of money would enjoy trashing a masterpiece
Ferrari with a Lambo dust cover😂
0 damage done to it. Whistlin diesels getting soft.
Can't wait to see the lawsuit
so where is that ferrari DESTROYED?.................   oh My bad its ClickBAIT ffs.
cease and desist letter coming in crazy💀💀💀
5:22 beast spotted.
Another idiot american thinking he´s funny for spending lots of money on a car and destroying it... Are americans that dumb/stupid to like "content" like that? Shame.  And yes, keep giving this ass*hole money and views for doing nothing for this world.  Influencers/Youtubers with content like that = Trash for this society. What is worst than this? People that feed him and give him views
Why is it shining the whole time
I like dis 1
cease and desist letter incoming
Plot Twist: it's a Rental
cease and desist letter coming in crazy
This is the new Mr beast
Lawsuit was the first word to come to my mind when I saw that lambo car cover 🤣
Haaaaaaa absolutely hilarious 🤣🤣🤣👍
Forza Horizon IRL wow
Honestly, this one kinda hurt my soul. I loved it though!
Why ? 🤷🏽‍♂️ Enough great cars Made for this   😴 Its Sad to see how the Ferarri destroyd
Out of everything done in the video. The Lamborghini cover is gonna be the reason
Legend of all men
Checking this channel out because of Berm Peak
Bro thinks he’s in beamng drive💀
U r a legend
fuck corporation fuck system
I mean you didn’t destroy it what you did to the orange Hilux is called destroying lamo😂😂
I get a kick out of sobhi001's comment in the beginning about how Cody " can't afford big boy toys" yet he owns a done up Audi, a Lambo, a G Wagon (well what's left of a G Wagon lol), a fully built General Lee, and has built literally one of the worlds largest trucks with Monstermax 2 and that's not even mentioning all his other toys and vehicles he has destroyed. But yeah, he is broke and can't afford "big boy toys" I doubt sobhi001 can even afford the wheels on one of the skylines Cody destroyed.
I laugh at all the haters that have no clue who Cody really is 🤣🤣 Creating haters for life while fattening the wallet.. keep it up!!
That's how you know you made it 😂 love it
Im wondering when ferrari is gon start a rally division because this shit aint look bad offroad 💀
Kont
Nah what how how tf did it not pop
We need behind the scenes footage of the team launching everything at that car. The amount and velocity was impressive.
Jys n propper poepol
Now send it here to me in 🇯🇲
Finally some good entertainment 🙌
The dommercial Ferrari didnt know they needed
where does one send it to I don't want you to miss it
I love how people still say "daddy's money"... Like no dad except trump makes this much money.  His damn youtube channel pays him people are idiots.
This video had me laughing the whole time do more of these
You're on the blacklist probably now lol
5:33 Forza horizon in real life
this is painful yet amazing to watch at the same time
Wish I was having this much fun in life. 😂
This is the best advertisement for that bubble I’ve ever seen lmao
WhistlinDiesel you need to buy a nokia and try to break it with your bare hands
Bros is playing Forza horizon 6🤣🤣🤣
Cody: I'll try to get sued by ferrari!  also Cody: *unintentionally making the biggest PR for ferrari showing off unseen offroad capabilities*
He’s gonna get a seize and desist letter 😢
This cracked me up!! I wish I bought car bubble stocks before this ran!!!
Men fuck that how you gonna do that to a Ferrari men.🤧
I thought he was going to destroy it... );
This is the crap not even mrbeast would do 😂
Boy what a great job with CGI.
I think of tickets and 🚓 police  when I think of Ferrari.   On side note I'd take a chevy over Ferrari for a sports car  Also the the hole in hood is designed to change aerodynamics improving downward force.
How does he pay for this lmao, sick videos make more
better than before
What’s in all those cases? Inquiring minds need to know thx
Yo 😂my guy will get sued by Ferrari watch it’s coming guys but he’s gonna have to give it back
I think Ferrari might want to consider building an off road vehicle after seeing how well their car did.
it goes without saying, but you have way too much money. And I love it.
if lets play gtav IRL was a person
The fact that he DIDNT destroy it says something
Yet another stupid video from a spoiled brat.
We have a 2021 F8 for your next video, and for $22k less :) Hit us up! @SellBuyDrive
Cody I love you, but I wish you would have gotten a regular production model and not a limited exclusive Ferrari. Not very many of those are made mate.   I’m fucking joking, thank you for risking your life in these crazy stunts of yours ❤
Living my dreams to do what ever the hell he wants hahaha
Wow  I love this video sooo much.  I never seen someone do this to a expensive car. Wow 👌 nice performance my brother 👏 👌
What a American Dumbass😂
Here before Ferrari legal team has this video taken down
I'm gonna be sick
Love the cars and trucks in the back 👌
Make it monster max 3
Where else can you get this caliber of content? Nowhere.
Είσαι βλάκας
.............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Throwing off some real TaxTheRich vibes
Cody never fails to help me realize how stupidly overpriced this shit is 😂
One of the best videos! thanks for the super laugh at the end.
I'm making 13:20-14:11 my new ringtone
Ya they go right through there and then right in to the windshield
This is the first time a Ferrari gets this treatment that’s not on Forza Horizon 🤣
🤡
Yeahh i fun for watching🔥🔥next buy koeniseg
I think this is going to far now
Whoever makes those bubbles genuinely did a great job. I thought for sure once the hammer came out the claw would pop it and the destruction would start.
Tub it out and put a 7.3 in it
China spy balloon sales after this video 📈📈📈
Gen Z. Nuff said
This video hurt me😂😂
I’ll trade you my car for that
DDE doesn’t drive there cars as hard as he does 😂😂
i bet you had that thing for weeks before you destroyed it lol
i love these video's of WhistlinDiesel , men doing men stuff ya love to see it
:DDDD It's when you have a lot of money :D
He should’ve vacuum sealed it instead of the bubble 💀
I was xpecting to see a quad or the Gtr thrown at it
Something that is whistling dea sle safe wow good job bubble
Three words, this was beautiful
Love it!  I am sure Ferrari's lawyers are sharpening their pencils.   Lol
This is hilarious! 😂😂😂😂😂
make it squatted
The whole time you were throwing stuff at the car bubble I couldn't help but wonder what's in all those boxes!!
Congrats to hitting #3 on trending right now on YouTube!!🙌everyone subscribe!
I totally have 3 of these pieces of shit sitting in a field some where lets do a ferrari derby
This was incredible content.  Maybe you can try ans sue ferarri before they sue you, for thinking about thinking of suing you🤝
someone has to make a meme video from yhe minute13:20 and final hahahaha its so funny hahahahahahahahahaha
i loved the outro
Just put a trans am Bird on the hood
It was so eye soaring but it's still awesome 😎

😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Drop it from HeavyD's UH-60 Blackhawk
Keep it up Cody you’re my favorite YouTuber
I love this so much but i have so much anxiety everytime cody gets behind the wheel of something rediculously expensive
This is what I do in GTA 5
at 11:05 i was reminded about how i felt after eating taco bell for dinner yesterday
lift it and put offroad tires on it
Great
Lmao awesome
Me in GTA V
I was hoping to see a series of videos with this car... Looks like it'll be done within a week!!! Great video bro!!!!
Dude I fucking love this shit
for sale 300 miles barely driven
Me when he destroys new buyable cars: 😃 Me when he breaks classic cars: 🤬
Finish the job
This was AMAZING! Loved every second of it.
Italian Dukes of Hazzard
Can I call you a cunt for treating that Ferrari like that it’s obscene.
This is amazing to watch because money isn’t important in this video just having fun
Me playing gta but irl
I love this sooooo much
Wish whistle could find a way to get views without destroying high value collectors items.... just think diesel you would been 400k richer if you could come up with a way to get the views using intelligence
12:16 so damn stupid spot, but got me laughing xDDD damn broken ferrari coz of broom xD
That bubble is insane lol
The bubble-test was the funniest thing i've seen in a while 😂🤣😂
Blow that b**** up and then weld it to a four-by-four Ford ranger frame and call it the retraddy...
This made my anxiety kick in real bad
that is deadly 10/10 would do
I can’t believe you didn’t use the Mike Tomlin clip for “we do not care” (4:27)
Can you plz buy a lady of the night, and do the same thing?
My best content  creator Cody 🤗
I’m pretty sure that Cody is the cure for depression 😂 every video make you smile all the way through I’m still smiling 3 random videos later
Ferrari will be loosing their freakin' minds! They hate people wrapping the cars, so this video is PERFECT. I LOVE IT. Ferrari will send letters to WhistlinDiesel now haha If anything the start of the video, going up hill shows how good the car is.
The shit being thrown was Biblically Epic
I think youtube hid your content from me
Fuck Ferrari. They only sell people cars to fund their racing teams. They don't care at all about their customers. If you don't believe me world it's easy to see. Ask anybody who doesn't get paid by fairyari. You're a bunch of uppity snobs. Lick my Boots. I'll piss on your LOGO if I see it
6:05 i think this part should have been filmed in a school zone :DDD
Cody - I have no idea how you keep a straight face through filming all this lol. Keep it up!
U didn't destroy it what a complete rip off of video :( Thumbs down!!!
He should buy a koenigsegg and do a durability test on that 👀
I hope that Ferrari will sue you and close your YouTube channel and get rid of that stupid face that you have if you decide to hate me because of this comment, it's not that my passion is cars and I've been with them for 16 years this and I don't think this will stop me from following this because people don't understand how the car is worth to us and you don't want you to do the same no hate
😔😔😔😔😪
Average forza player
This kid is the epitome of why first cousins shouldn’t breed.
Tonight on demolition ranch we’re gonna find out if a ferrari can stop a .50 cal
Where can you buy that air thing Where the ferarri is in at the end 😃
i think someone destroying a ferrari in protest of there dumbass rules needed to be done
Bro really be  thinking he’s in GTA right now 😭😂😂🤘
Fucking awesome 😂😂😂😂 to TRULY hear that car *chefs kiss*
Pop tune=Carolina squat of the car community
Buy me a car😓😪
Time for durability test and destroy it for real it’s ur style don’t let us down
Should build a rally car out of it
That 180 was actually so clean
Tell about Tire's
This is why people unsubscribe....
he drive the same way i drive in forza horizon 🤣🤣🤣
4:41 he kinda looks like redneck Elon musk that’s tired of your shit
So that car bubble.... Actually.. pretty damn sweet. I cannot believe it survived
Impressive, undeniably, underrated
You should give that away but all in 1 piece!!!
I’m be done drive like that in Forza
Хороший тачка 😭😭😭😭
why?
You should turbo it 😂
Plot Twist: Cody preemptively sues ferrari for not withstanding his brand's standard of hard working luxury vehicles
When you enter the forza dimension
Forza horizon
There is no doubt that you have wayyyy too much money in your bank account. I love watching your videos but for us financially normal guys this really hurts me to watch this. These are the type of cars that most of us guys have always dreamed of owning and most likely will never own and yet you get to destroy them for fun. Insane!
Why is there a still intact bentley in the back at 1:43😂😂   Edit: just noticed the porsch, please leave that beauty in 1 peace lol
The end was fucking hilarious. Love the editing!
Best product review ive ever seen on Youtube. Gift them this Video as a commercial clip please! xD
finally someone have the balls to fuck whith ferrari
look with all the things that you could do with your money like helping homele3ss vets would be a great video for you. but you buy a 400- thousand- dollar car to destroy it .. WHY?
Owner of the company is like whos the guy that sold the car to him 😂😂
crush a supra
Although anxiety inducing this was enjoyable.
The guy that buy 255335 bevor.. iam sorry that you will never can buy one of these
You are stupid
Cody:☝🏻😃..🎇 STOP STOP STOP STOP….stop😂😂😂😂😂
Cody’s my hero 🙏
He just said a hammer, not everything in the junk drawer
เจ้ากะรวยโพดหัวหน้า
1 scratch on that car was probably the total cost of all of my vehicles I've had in my life I feel so poor lol
You crazy man? Ferrari demand you
So fun to watch! :)
He’s playing forza in real life lol 😂
Very Nice whistlin diesel , I wish I can do the shit you do one day..
Though you would drive the monster max over the bubble wrapped Ferrari
YOU SHOULD HAVE PAINTED “SCION XB BLUEISH😊 IF YOU KNOW YOU KNOW” BEFORE TAKING IT ON SOME SWEET JUMPS...😂😂😂😂  I LOVE IIIIITTTTTT.
Anyone else waited for a Kitchen sink to be thrown at the car?
can i have it after you’re done
If you have a lot of money, then please help people like me  who need only 10 thousand dollars and their life will be entirely changed in a positive way think on it may God bless you more
What an incredible advertisement for that bubble
Mi sad :( I tought you really Will destroy it
forza horizon irl
Mr Beast help the blind, while this prick pour more money in big cars company to then make himself look like a total redneck retard no wonder he’s mouth is the shape of a PROSTITUE CUNT!!
this SH*t is so funny  going to pull a move like Mr. Beast did with Elon Musk  Can I have it when your done with it?  ...... LOL   you better get a kick back on the sales of that car cover after the ending      I was laughing so damn hard
This is not destruction, it was even less what a normal car "suffer" during its lifetime. I bet with just a month of regular driving in my country (Portugal) it would so much more destroied due to the sh!ty roads we have
dude is living in forza
Assuming that was actually him driving, he has amazing skills, considering so many aficionados (weekend warriors) can't even manage to turn out of a parking lot without spinning out of control
Wtf I just saw a meme about this a week ago
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
i usually love Codys shenanigans but i definitely cringed a couple times watching this one.
My anxiety levels watching this were insane 😂
You're kind of a one trick pony
Lawsuit in 3.. 2.. 1..
LOL you can smell the salt and butt hurt from people commenting.
Great advertisement for the car bubble!
Not as bad as I thought he’d beat on it, I was fully expecting an excavator bucket smash, bottoming it out on random things and the hood ol window punch
Dude, you just made the best car cover infomercial of all time!
why not a sf90
Turn it into a amphibious Ferrari 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 $WTK crypto is the best one 💎
They should put that Ferrari In That bubble thingy and take it to where their is a tornado and see what happens to it.
How long will the car run inside the bubble?
Who needs 4wd when you have wheel speed
Destroy a toyota prius or corolla (try) & tesla plad next.
I'm guessing chinaspyballoon sales bout to go off the chart.
This is not a hilux dude.
Ferrari lawsuit cooking up
Forza IRL
@WhistlinDiesel.   Make a video and show is if you guys get sued.
Upchurch dropper a song called monster max 1
After you destroy it plz gift it to me I'm the first one to say this
@WhistlinDiesel throw on Lift kit an monster truck wheels asap⁉️‼️‼️🤣🤣🤣🤣
Jealous is a understatement I wish I could do this🥲
Keeping America great
This was the best video I've seen in a while 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 the guy writing stuff down as Cody breaks stuff had me rolling
How bout u give that 400000 to the people of Ohio who can't afford to leave instead of another dumb Ass video of you thinking you are funny.
This is great but we need to see if this thing can jump make a huge BMX style dirt ramp in the yard n fucking send it
Man I am so glad Cody is different lol or we wouldn’t be seeing him destroy a $400,000 car😂😂😂
Man. You're like the opposite of Mr. Beast. Piss money away for content rather than give it away.
the end throwing everything and the kitchen sink made me spit my drink out LMAO
Why do they care what's done with something someone bought from them?
Destroy that pile
Ok…THIS video is totally going viral soo…WELCOME new viewers to WhistlinDiesel’s channel. Look around if you dare. He…does this. This is his thing.
MAN..... make sure you never stop by a Ferrari factory or even enter Italy... they might put you in jail right away.
how well will the ferrari do dropped from a helicopter in the bubble?
@thierryvigneauboiserie
Best product tester known! The car protector company should use that as there promo video
My reaction is this dude going "stop it" *sheer panic*
Just like how the GTA V super cars do better offroading that the pickup trucks
O man noooooo
liar you did not destroy it .  Your a man of your word get out there and entertain us . btw pretty cool air bubble thing.
Someone must have bought this on behalf for cody to use theres no way ferrari looked this guy up and went yes sell him one. Next test. Do a full car detailing video but with abrasive disks and molasis
how many cars are there in the back? Whats happening?
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hell yeah
Fu*k Ferrari. This should be a new trend where people buy ferrari only to destroy them
meh as long as you don't destroy a PT cruiser i'm good
Annnnnnnnnnnnd next video finna be "Ferrari is suing my ass six ways to Sunday"
😂
What model ferrari is this?
Bro is 100% getting sued
RAAAARIIII LEFT THE CHAT!
Real life. How to climb mount chilliad
The fucking tire being thrown into the bubble.... that shit killed me. hahahaha
My man playing forza in real life
i almost closed the video soon as he removed the cover what a beautiful car!
I love the Doug DeMuro “-THIIIIS…”
the part with Doug Demuro had me rolling..... "THISSSSSS"
🔥 🔥 DESTROY THAT POS! 😂😂😂😂  #WhistlinDiesel
Tax the rich would be proud
So angery but so happy to see this. Mixed emotions to the max😂
Amazing outro
Forza got way better on its graphics 🤯
Bro is just playing forza horizon
I think it needs to be green like the grass. You can't be hunting in a red Ferrari, the deer will see you
This is fukn nerverecking
This so brutal but funny to watch
Rich rebuilds needs one of these car balloons for his 911
Awesome amazing big brother i love this shit keep it up
Love this 😂😂
This man puts a smile on my face no homo
Are you gonna have any Ferrari mulch for sale soon?
Okay for the ending I’m almost 100% sure they had a treadmill or 2 sliding everything at the car 😂
Lift kit and mud it
💀🤣🤣🤣 i lost it when y’all started trowing hella shit at it 😂
That guy can really drive
The ending felt like the best sponsor that company would ever have
Ferrari durability test 10/10
What the heck bro. Why is it still in one piece? Do you even care about your fans?
The car is so buetiful
Clickbait title!
I appreciate how this is a big middle finger to mindless materialism
The cartoonish lengths this man is willing to go to see how durable something is...
Very disrespectful to Ferrari. This is like destroying the Mona Lisa. I don't see how people find this amusing. Just because you can, doesn't mean you should
Bro thinks life is Forza horizon
I love this guy 🤣🤣🤣
I wonder how many bricks this car can haul?
Give your money to poor people instead of doing non sens shit!
This honestly hurts. But it’s his he can do what he wants.
Well. I'm definitely buying that car bubble thing.
I'm surprised you didn't shoot it when it was in the bubble lmao
So GTA was correct in showing it can climb hill and mountains 🔥😭🤣
Yeh, it's 400k, but, at the end of the day, it's just a materialistic thing. His whole channel has been based on how ridiculous it is to put so much value in stuff like this while other pompous ass owners are like...."oh, don't touch". This kid is a legend in so many ways 👏
They should just get rid of DOT crash and safety standards, save a bunch of cash and let Cody do it
forza irl lol
Sell that thing to me for 1 dollar 😂
get this man to 10 million subs please
Sell that thing to me for 1 dollar 😂
Sell that thing to me for 1 dollar 😂
Ferrari is such a stage mom. i don't understand this guy though. he buys new expensive cars and wrecks them...i don't get it. He's so destructive.
If "fuck it we ball" was a person
Sell that to me for 1dollar 😂
Ferrari is too scared to get close to your property 😂  511
The 2 red Porsches looked scared in the background 😂
when are you gonna buy a hummer or a humvee?
If you're looking to sell it after your done, Richard Rawlings is buying totaled Ferraris lately! 🤣
This man really turned a Ferrari into a rally car and I’m here for it😭
What the hell is this shit?
The bubble was actually amazing. I bet a lot of car collectors already have or will have them after seeing its durability.
This totally needs a lift kit and monster truck wheels.
You are actually helping me get over my unhealthy desire for nice thingsYou are actually helping me get over my unhealthy desire for nice things
The Ferrari handled the offroad like a treat had me smiling the whole time. Now Ferrari has too legally refer to this car as a rally car because it just did that well
Cody just had more fun with his Ferrari in 14 minutes than anyone ever has before. He genuinely enjoys these cars to their fateful end.
Fact is still probably cheaper than the equivalent in ad placement! :P
Cody just had more fun with his Ferrari in 14 minutes than anyone ever has before. He genuinely enjoys these cars to their fateful end.
I’m genuinely impressed with how well the car bubble did 😂 not fully sure why you’d want something like that, but I guess they could be useful if you were storing a lot of cars in a building or something
forza in real life
Ferrari is lucky he took it easy on the car :)Ferrari is lucky he took it easy on the car :)
This is one of those special videos where you find yourself smiling the whole time.
I feel like I’m watching a real life version of me playing Forza Horizon 😂
Now we wait
You forgot the kitchen sink!
Really disappointing, when you buy a Ferrari you buy also history. But probably is something that you will never understand ... What Ferrari means...
Love it ! Trash it !!!
Did not, let me repeat it again I DID NOT stopped laughing and smiling all the time
Hand me a    H a m m e r
#smashtheferrari
oh hell no
Bro this video is gonna be evidence in court💀
Cody why….why.🤣
can i buy it, as is? 1 dollar?
You could’ve left the “just to destroy it” part out of the title WD, we got that part by now😂😂😂
Start up the car in the bubble 👀
Forza needs to hire you for simulated offroad physics XD
Not impressed What must you be like with a beer in you so annoying👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎 You spend one day with Mark McCann, but you didn’t have an SVJ handy ripped off his idea totally 🫵😳 But to an annoying level
This video just makes me happy.😂
u sold me on that bubble lol
พังๆๆ
This is number 1 trending
He’s driving it like it’s forza 😂
Such a video I love
The producer of that plastic bubble couldn't ask for better advertisement than this.
What's wrong with those who support this being?  the car is being built by people who work up to a week to build a single model, and that's how he treats it.  We have reached an incredible level of indecency🤮
feels like forza
Definitely a Ferrari engineer smiling seeing the true capabilities of his/her work
What a idiot, he bought the Ferrari to destroy it, I hope Ferrari give him back is money, and take back the car.
Bruh I knew as soon as I saw the Ferrari he was going to destroy it because of the lawsuits
Who else remembers taxtherich
i don't have a deffenition off humanity anymore, love it
shame on you you're just a bored useless rich man
Pov: you played too much GTA
You know its good when the Deisel is Whistling
Loved the Doug feature
IDIOT
Just saw him on 840 😂
Bro makes Andrew Tate look like a pussy
Ferrari bouta sue somebody💀
Whistlin Diesel, I hate you  but I love you.
Vergognati. Questo è un affronto nei confronti delle persone che si trovano in difficoltà. Sei solo un inutile ricco annoiato.
Car bubble sales after this video 📈
Хочу выучить английский что бы понимать о чем говорит этот тип...  Я конечно в шоках
This is by far the best add for buying a Ferrari.    Wanna make it up big muddy grass hills buy a Ferrari!
It will be destroyed before they even send out the letter 😂
dudes playing real life forza horizon
Real gta character.
Test the ATLAS ATV!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Counting down the minutes until the cease and desist letter comes.
This is what needs to happen more often, a giant middle finger to Ferrari.
The last scene killed me
This dude just played Forza Horizon in real life 😂😂
How many ladders do yall have?
if i type "ferrari" in youtube, your video comes first :p
i think im suffering from severe anxiety
The Ferrari bubble reminds me of the bubble boy movie. retarted Ferrari.
At the end what’s in all those cases
Forza Horizon
fucken outstanding keep up the good work
Clickbait at its finest
This is the best video of a Ferrari I have ever seen. That thing sounds great on these hills.
at the end he threw everything at it like a cartoon man 😂 even though ferrari is my absolut favorite car i enjoy watching this its only entertainment
this is the best wd video i’ve seen in a while!
Squatted Ferrari instead of squatted truccs
But it's not a Bugatti
I think I’m buying a car ballon….
It's good to buy things that you don't actually own, that's why the rest of the world is now modeled after this concept  Won't stop you spending anyway
Very surprise that he didn’t drop it from the sky. Ik he wouldn’t.
Just watched ur vedio for the first time and I watched some of ur old vedios just now & I was smiling the whole time  People on YouTube buy cars just to show them but u are seriously having fun with them And those who say that the thing you do are stupid and they wasted their time watching ur vedios will never be able to do thing u do even if the had that much of money oor those cars cuz they can’t  U r Awesome 🔥🔥🔥🔥
What is wrong with this fool
Absolutely love this😂
Bruh i looked this video up yesterday and I couldn’t find it and now its on my fyp, tf
Shoudla slapped a "Coca Cola" logo on it.
God I love this kid
I could give a 💩 less about Ferrari lol so I lived this video, not a single cringe here
I hate Ferraris but that thing sounds pretty nasty ngl
Cody is playing Forza IRL.  He is the chosen one. Cody, do the Internet justice and put LONG TRAVEL SUSPENSION on your ferrari and rally test it. It's every boy's dream.
Bro always have me dying laughing lol. I bet you won't do the craziest thing and give that car to me lol. Anyway love your channel bro keep doing your thang. Much love from Dallas Tx
Definitely buying that car bubble lol best commercial ever
Watching it for the 10th time 😂
Dare a uno così un capolavoro del genere per fare ste cazzate è come dare un dolce ad un maiale. Sei ignorante come una vacca.
He finally has a car faster than the R8 lol
this man looks like me in gta5 with the italy gt
Me on forza. With my Ferrari woods drifting. Life is a simulation
Ferrari needs to make a Baja truck if it's that good off roading
Irl forza horizon
Dear young man, please come to Christ and don’t waste precious time. Life is very short and once we all will stand in front of God to give account for our life. You can live a meaningful, useful life when Christ gives you a new heart. Repent and believe in Jesus Christ.
Lol, all the random items in the shop, a crutch comes out of no where!
Me playing forza
Every time my kid mentions you i go and break a toy then leave you a hateful comment
Well you whistlindiesel are a hillbilly and you are addicted to tractors, leave cars to the real gentleman, ur money will be used to improve ferrqri tho hehehe
13:20 @HowToBasic vibes hahaha
It reminds me of gta 5 online when you take your Supercar on the mountain to escape the police 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wanna sell it for 10k? *that would make you the first person ever to sell a ferrari at 98% off
give me a hammer throws everything inside the garage 😂
Send this of to @JerryRigEverything for analysis
I have nothing of particular value to say, just commenting for support.
This was fun to watch ! Honestly , do what you want if it’s yours fck it !
Thought it was guna actually get destroyed like the title of the video says. Kinda disappointed
I do not understand why someone would do this.  Just makes no sense to me at all to waste a perfectly good car doing this type of stuff to it.
I'll be seeing you soon Mr.Diesel. We'll played...we'll played... Best regards from the Peaky Blinders.
me playing forza lol.
Bring the helicopter 😂
Egy igazán primitív műveletlen suttyó vagy. Sajnos a világ egyelőre ilyen primitív bunkókra vevő, mint amilyen te vagy, de őszintén remélem, hogy ez csak átmeneti állapot és visszakerülsz abba a szargödörbe, ahová igazából való vagy és ahonnan soha nem szabadott volna kikerülnöd. Remélem nem volt túl sok az összetett mondat...
Forza in real life😂
I wish I had this much money 😄 im too poor to do this same to my 15 year old fiesta 😭
Okay I must admit I have never really been a fan of the Ferrari. But if you're watching this video I'm pretty impressed. But I will say I don't know what I'm more impressed about, the Ferrari or the bubble
lift this mofuker up
ferraris are neat cars but good lord do I hate the company. John Carmack (The legendary programmer) is actually blacklisted by ferrari because he DARED to modify it himself under the hood.
I watched this video and I came to two conclusions. Ferrari would never let you buy one knowing you're you. They have to be working with you to trick us all. 2 you do love your cars, that's why many of them still are 1 piece, also why you washed your ferrari before ziplocking it. You might say it's to keep the garage clean but we know you not afraid of a little mud in the shop
Aaaah he’s gonna get a cease and assist 😂
Can I buy it after you use it?😂🔥
Hahahahaha eat the rich
Aint bad
Congrats bro on the car
Espero que la la demanda de ferrari  de haga verga
13:18 they just kept going💀
This is actually a pretty good ad for the car bubble
Okay am I the only one kinda impressed the bubble worked so well?
I love the big middle finger to Ferrari's bullshit
So Forza really isn't that fall off from real life...
😆🤣😂😹😆🤣
Fant@bulou$
Pity you can't drive the car bubble everything would bump off like beach balls 🤣🤣
3:19 DADDY DOUG
I love this crazy mf 😂😂😂😂😂
I'd tell Ferrari to eat my huh yeah sideways that I paid an arm, leg and possibly both nuts for it so its rightfully owned by hm me. Suck it ferrari you nut huggers
The rain is from the Ferrari gods getting pissed off, they really want to sue now!!
Should’ve done it stock so we can see a true ferrari stock now they can blame the tuners
Yes
Literally threw everything at it but the kitchen sink..🤣🤣
this man just plays forza horizon in real life and I'm all in for it
Next up: Rolls Royce Phantom durability test
POV: Me driving in Forza Horizon
Bruh he's driving like I do in GTA
So I guess I can rally a ferrari lol
Plastic and ugly cars.
Seeing the cover change to lambo had me in stitches 😅
If you loved this video, don’t waste your time going to watch StreetSpeed drive a corvette in a field
Kitchen sink?
This thing needs some reaper wheels!
Yes, this is my off-road vehicle so I want a pristine Ferrari with low mileage..ohhh and add exhaust and a tune.
Just give me it
You just made the best advertisement for the bubble company
So much poverty, hunger and lack of conditions in the world and this is how you choose to use your money... You sir are an idiot!
King😎😂😂
Butt Head!
3:56 bro that was a lot of spit wtfff😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😂 I know bro mouth is MOIST💀💀😂

Ferrari legal team is on the way🤣
Stupid motherfuker!c'è gente che non ha da mangiare , tu hai la fortuna di avere una Ferrari e la distruggi!?!?!vergognati pezzo di merda!
Damn good advertising for the bubble thingy 😂
Ýou and the boys should have a big airsoft war that would be a top tier video like this one.
That car is so beautiful 😂
The ending of this video is the best damn commercial for that bubble hands down, just everyone throwing shit at it 😂😂😂😊
you are the readonn ferrari doesn't let anyone buy new cars.... AWESOME!!!!
Wow, thats a cool, fast sports car!
This highly amusing and fairly stressful to watch
Forza Horizon 5 IRL
an experience i can only have in forza horizon. did way better than i thought it would.
If Jerryrigseverything can get away with stress testing high end electronics, I don’t see why WhistlinDiesel can’t get away with stress testing cars
bro is literally playing gta going off road with the grotti turismo 🤣
I have a strong feeling that Ferrari f8 dakar edition is coming soon...
Who we we sold him the car won’t be purchasing anymore Ferraris 😂
so many military crates
Pro Tip: *Aircraft Stripper is GREAT for Paint*  You're welcome 😆
lol tryna pretend like u got money destroying a car h didnt even hurt it prob gonna sell it after broke as s meanwhile i have 2 airpods hulu netflix and  spotify too
This video represents probably the best usage of a Ferrari in the history of company's existence.
Real life Forza Horizon
It'd be a shame if this car were to get destroyed and swapped with corinna kopfs f8 in LA brielfy making her think hers was destroyed 😉
Haha sick!
Bodyswap the Ferrari on monstermax
Cody = Living Legend!!! He promises only quality content and never fails to deliver!!!
Jesus is coming back
Engine swap it with a 1ltr
Huge respect to Cody
Domani ti svegli freddo
next up: koegnigsegg durability test
Good advertising for that bubble 😂
Don’t know why people get upset. I mean do they not destroy vehicles in fast and furious and countless other movies. Just for your ENTERTAINMENT. Kills me. I love this. Really good camera shots too.
At least it didn't turn out like the r32 R.i.p
Everything I wanted to do with a Ferrari just didn't think of it...
Test a 1st gen taco
RIP purrari
Safari my Ferrari
These videos just keep getting better! Waiting for 10M subs and Chiron durability test.  Until then the Ferrari content will be the best we have seen!
Min 2:17 in the back; his leg shaking out of fear of damaging the car LOL
Oh man Ferrari is sweating profusely while watching this video 😅😅😅😅😎🤙
U take such gud care of cars man love u
hay why not get a ripsaw and test it's off-roading capabilities?
Squatted ferrari?
What a phenomenal ad for the bubble though 😂
Ferrari should have issued an official response that there will be no lawsuit because you showed how durable their car is and they thank you.
that ending was phenomenal.
causully listening to cody, destroy a car on repeat over, and over, and over, enjoying it the whole time
Dude I don't understand why you don't have 10 millions subscribers right now
Ok first,I think You are crazy,but you have some good ideas..
You know, I actually enjoy watching him destroy a Ferrari. They are all garbage.
Ferrari sales just went up 1000% Thx for REALLY RIDING THAT HORSE🎉
You should pay a visit to Luxury Baazar they have many indestructible Richard Mille watches in stock!\ _you know they're cheap asf_
enjoy the toxic rain
What a great moving picture
I was expecting a lot of negative comments on this video
6:57 The fact that the Hilux is still alive is really a testament to how fucking well built that truck is.
Great
Haha 🤣 the best
Dude you need to do spectator drags at the freedom factory 😂😂😂. Everybody racing you would be terrified
Bro living gta 5 lifestyle
Next video: " we got a lawsuit from Ferarri" 😂😂 that's gonna be a good one.
The ending 😂😂😂😂😂
Holy shit this was badass!!
im crying 😭😭😭
This is what happens when rednecks make money
Your an idiot
огонь видос)
I haven't laughed like that at a YouTube video in a long time
I've had a Ferrari on a rallycross course in iracing, but this is next level shit! 🤣
What are you doing step ladder?
Plz don't destroy it🙏
the term genius and whistlingdiesel probably do not get used in the same sentence very often.... but the 'get me a hammers scene' dare i say genius
Everything but the kitchen sink lol
I normally cringe when WD destroys awesome and expensive cars. Not today folks! This actually made me smile and laugh. I guess knowing Ferrari is trigger-happy about suing made it so much better.
I wish i had the money to do stuff like this lol
Yet again another amazing great,and fucking fantastic video lol, great content keep it up, and you know Ferrari gonna be pissed lmfao 😆
Lift it and put aggressive mud tires on it!!
I LIke It :P
I just wanna work with him lol dudes living my dream
*Life is a bit like GTA ... You don't need a fast car if you want to be* rollin' down the street, smokin' indo Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back With my mind on my money And my money on my mind.
No brains and definitely no respect for a masterpiece of engineering. Why destroy such a nice car? See your local doctor.
Valid point in reference to Koenigsegg
shame on you, an Ethiopian child could have drove that car.
Furrarri guys be crying right now....
Left a comment
Ferrari has the capability to do all things it's jus that there's not much people born like whistlin diesel🙉
😂😂 The ending montage is comedic genius.
*sigh… goes to comments*
Oh yes, this is exactly what I expected and I am not disappointed 🅱️🔥
Man, I’m watching this while owning my car payment.
Protect this man at all costs.
Now I want a ferrari
Bro Ferrari is gonna sue you lmao 🤣
The thought of this upsetting Ferrari brings me great joy.
Was waiting for them to shoot it with a pistol at the end
Bro how about helping some starving people somewhere in the world or somthing a ittle more Noble with your money. Do you have a soul? 400k can buy alot of help and give you alot more stimulationa and grattitude then this car ever will. just sayn.
The bubble is actually impressive, good advert for it I guess
The Goat 🤣🤣🤣
Shield for Huracan on F*** F :)))
good job 👍
He took it easy....WTF! What happened to your balls, boy!? Did they get smipped !?
Your father should have used a condom!
You’re literally living forza horizon
Law suits
Ferrari watching like 👁️👄👁️
Damn car bubble thing is legit.
Guy does what we all wanna do🥲👊🏽
WhistlinDiesel driving his Ferrari up his driveway ripping around all the corners is how I drive my Ferrari's in Forza
Good shit Cody!!!
In America they have no ground to stand on let them sue
I feel like this is a car bubble commercial. That mf held upppppp
The ending gave me the giggles from the gut. You really need bubble protection on the road. Drive with the bubble on the street. Has to be a way
Take it to an Scca really cross event
Take it to an Scca really cross event
THIS IS GOLD😂😭I hate Ferrari as a company they’re so petty lol
But he didnt destroy it.........
Bruski is a real life video game
Its just a car.
13:46 bro
I can’t wait for the Bugatti
Ferrari: are we a joke to you? Whistling: yes
*_$400,000 for that?…_*
It don’t make sense how is he buying 400k car and he only made 15k so far on this video
This is in my top 10 favorite things a human has ever done
Just loop part where you guys are tossing random stuff at the bubble, and make that into an NFT lol
you didn't destroy it though 🤔
Trade me your Audi r8.
When Ferrari sees this they gonna shiiiiiiiit a brick 😂 love it 🤘
Sam Hyde: I want to kill your fucking car.  WD: I will kill your fucking car.
Funny as, as always
That spy balloon is better than I thought! I guess that is why we had to use two 500,000$ a piece, sidewinder missiles to just kill one of the 3 other car balloons floating over America and Canada
Happy Birthday Cody 🎉
if you do end up getting the letter please light this thing up with a few machine guns and burn it down make them really foam at the mouth lol
Che coglione totale!
Ferrari in Lamborghini cover😂
He's out here destroying a $400,000 car and I'm trying to figure out what side of the Taco Bell menu I can afford tonight...
Don't worry, Ferrari can't send a cease and desist order if theirs nothing left to cease and desist
This dude is great 👍
Glad to see a Ferrari doing what its supposed to do
Grind the roof off to make it convertible immediately!
I feel clickbaited, the car is fine.
Best fucking video ever 😂❤
buy a police car (1 or more) and get your friends to chase you while you are in the ferrari lol
i don nooot like you anymore
for sure the company who makes the car bubble will use this video as a marketing for their product
I love this channel so much!! Can you give me a free car? I am a very hard worker and would love to have anything from you!! Thanks buddy
Just think all of us made this happen and I’ve never been prouder 🤣
He deserves every like 😂❤
I swear its always an anxiety attack when watching your videos. I haven't watched one of your videos in a while, but the feeling never left.
If you have any other reason to buy a Ferrari, something wrong with you :DD
That bubble is quite impressive
What Ferrari is this
The random gunshots when stuff was getting thrown lmao
@Triple a needs to make a Collab here
also i love you for this n so glad you went yt lol
I have liked Ferraris every since I was a kid and I first didn't know I was going to enjoy this so much.. But here I am laughing. I would love a piece of that thing when you're done.
I need to know what’s up with the cases 😂
ive always wanted to take the body of a Ferrari and throw it on to a bronco frame with a 8inch lift.
Last part was funny as shit
Cody keeps upping himself
The end part 😂😂😂😂😂
Bro is playing forza horizon
shame on you you fokkin prink , you don't deserve it , this is a rape you have shit in your brain your mom is to blame to have give birth to such a donkey ..
seriously greatest video ever lool i always wondered how a ferrari would do in some kind of mud.
The tire was too heavy to throw 🤣🤣
After Tax The rich, you made me 💦💦
OMG i was crying from laughing so hard during the last part of the video
I have never had a dream to buy a Ferrari. Now I have it lol
The car condom company should just use the video of them throwing everything at it as their ad.
The video doesn't really start till about 10 minutes in.  Need to cut the nose off for better approach angle. For the money you'll make on this video, I'd see how aerodynamic I could make it with monster max
the car is in one peice is this even wd's video ferrari is lucky he went easy on this one
>Ferrari  *Fiat
AFAIK Dedmau5 got a subpoena for painting his Ferrari the "wrong colour". Just hinting. ;)
This is definitely Cody's most expensive video 😂
YouTube asked me if your video was good I and I answered it’s very good informative and calming ! Which is true I love it
now put a tron cat wrap and tell ferrari to eat a dick
Trending #3
What about a gun ... or just a dart ? something pointed .
Watching this video made me realize that this channel has been the new Top Gear the whole time.
That bubble thing is actually pretty impressive.
I guess all those court videos got a ton of views cause Ferrari actually does sue EVERYONE who does 1% of what we just saw 😂🤣😭
I hate Ferrari so like this is the content I love 😂🔥
4:20 THERES A SUPRAA!!! ITS PEEKING IN THE BACK
Forza Horizon IRL.
I would love to see the behind the scenes footage of the final minute so we can see the exhaustion on the faces of the WD crew after that assault.  Reminds me of the tool fight back in old days.  All smiles here.
This made me happy
How tf did that bubble not pop
Part 2 F8 chased by Purosangue with automatic firearms.......go Hollywood!
Say, what’s the retail on one of those?
Me in Forza horizon
Id use this as an add for that car cover 😂
The outro was hilarious 😂
I think I just pissed my self 😂.
this is the most favorite video on this channel, I really like it
absolútna neúcta, niektorý ľudia nemajú čo jesť a tu sa robia takéto veci
Next thing you know he gets a mail and is getting sued fro mishandling a ferrari XD Edit: the part where they take it off road is badass
Gta real life be like
"Lawsuit incoming"
Wow the most impressive bubble-test on the net.  But can it stop a 50 like your hard skull did already. 10/10, glad to not see you breathing in pointless pollution.
didn’t really destroy this one
Can't wait to see it on Copart!
Ferrari Off-Road Challenge!
Me in Horizon 5 looking for a barn find
Nice
Lamborghini boys in Bologna: 👍
Very impressive👍👍 I always satisfied to all your video.
this is so painfull to watch
I will never understand why a car is called a "SHE"....
I could barely stand to watch! 😅😅😂😂 that was awesome!
With that title, you got have the planet fuming 😂
I was imagining a rubber duck at the end. Much disappointment. UNSUBSCRING!!! I'm going to crank on my hog!
ههغههه
Ateghedaeserestabatesa'conl'acquache tomareghacusinaifolpi.
Need to try and skip the car like a stone over a pond 😈
They turned Forza Horizon into real life
the biggest troll on the internet lol
Somehow I think I got tricked into watching a commercial for that car bubble protector product. 🤣
Bolestan dečko...
I had never in my life had more anxiety than watching this 😭😭😂
Baddass
That Ferrari actually surprised me on that rally course 😄
LIFT THAT CAR!  LIFT THAT CAR!  New chant, monstermax 0.5 lmfao
13:18 anyone else was kinda hoping for somebody to be thrown there too at this part?
Keep em coming WD , nearly pissed myself
I enjoyed the video...I mean I really did before realizing that I don't even have a personal car.......like dude why?
Honestly, this is what Ferrari deserves for being such an ass of a company. I love their cars, but I hate hate hate the people.
I'm surprised DDE hasn't got a cease and desist for making a Ferrari into a drift car.
Part of me is crying but the other part is like f**k yesss 🤝🏽😂
Big respect i was worried he was just gonna crush it with an excavator and roll it off a hill
Put the horse and buggy wheels from the hellcat on the Ferrari or better yet, turn it into a lowrider with air suspension and hop it!
I think this video was sponsored by the company that makes that car bubble 🤣🤣🤣
Can't wait to see what happens next lmao
Say what you want about Ferrari but the sound is like no other
Bet, he is gonna get band of buying Ferrari
This guy has fuk U money
This is one of those videos where you wonder how an mentally challenged person got access to that kind of money. This is not ok and he should be locked up in a mental hospital. People like this do not need to be walking the same streets we do. He is a threat to society and his actions will only encourage more mentally challenged people to do more stupid things. Just look at this guy, his face screams DOWN SYNDROME.
The fish tail he did was 🔥🔥 Ngl
Whistling diesel = best YouTuber ever
I cringed a lot during this video. what did the car do to you ??????????🥲🥲🥲🥲
Crying while watching 😮😢 dream car bro
These cars are garbage and so is the majority of its owners so I really enjoyed seeing this pile being destroyed
Great offroader! Take it to a proper offroad track and see how it handles !
fuck ferrari :)
Thank you so much for this! FREAKING EPIC!....
Patiently waiting for the TANK vs FERRIARI video!
The amount of stuff thrown at it in the end was impressive 😂
that wAs great 😂😂😂
Come on Whistlin, put some effort into your video's. Put the Ferrari on Monster truck tires or something. Buying shoes/cars and breaking them is boring.
I must say, it’s not very good at doing it’s job, it’s terrible off-road
it looks sick as rally car
It is so boring 🥱
On one hand, I’m glad he didn’t demolish the car but on the other I expected more with his reputation.
The kitchen sink at the end
Why is it not destroyed
Worst ending you’ve ever had and yet I still loved it
To all my brothers and sisters in Christ advancing God's Kingdom, please know that God sees your work for His Kingdom. Don't let anyone discourage you. What you're doing is right and good. Just make sure that your spreading of the Gospel is in love, no matter what. Y'all will be in my prayers. Jesus Bless ❤️🙏
The Gospel:  (I am not a bot, I'm just someone who enjoys spreading the gospel. Much love to you all!)  The gospel is the good news that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died for our sins and rose again, eternally triumphant over His enemies, so that there is now no condemnation for those who believe, but only everlasting joy.  Peter says in 1 Peter 2:24, “He himself bore our sins in His body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness.”  So Christ died not only to forgive sin, but also that it might die in the lives of His people.  ~Quoting John Piper~  ALSO My friend put together a great PowerPoint about the Gospel and Jesus being the prophesied Messiah.   I'd like to share if you're interested, just reply and I can send you the link.  May Jesus Bless you!
I can't be the only one that was waiting for a hilux to crash into the bubble at the end.
I hated every second of it but still wanted more.💀
Waiting for the garage jump Cody!!  Got to get me one of these tents. Thay Will be expensive as hell now thoe.
Hope it had some PPF on it . 😢
This was probably the best video I’ve ever seen of WD’s 🤣
The best Ferrari commercial ever!
So, that spy balloon performed quite well…  Best commercial they could ever consider!
dude out here playing forza in real life 💀
You should do a trailer towing test next 😂
Ferrari would probably throw a tantrum if you even took their "off road" vehicle (Ferrari Purosangue) off road, so I'm excited to see their response to this! ❤️
@WhistlinDiesel You should frame all the cease and desists you get and hang them in the shop 😂
That was his last one.....
There's no way they can sue him right? I mean he literally showed the car driving through a ranch and then coming out spotless after a wash
Don't store up treasures here on earth, where moths eat them and rust destroys them, and where thieves break in and steal. Store your treasures in heaven, Matthew 6:19 just saying... maybe you're on the right track...aha
He bought the wrong forza horizon
He is playing froza horizon
💀💀🤣🤣🤣
There's car crushers 😈😈😈😈😈😀😉
Isn’t this views generating tactic getting old? Probably start giving shit away next.
🤣 you threw every thing but the shop sink at it !!!!
I thinks it's safe to say the safety bubble is a quality product 🤣
No sweet jumps? Who buys a Ferrari and then doesn't do a sweet jump in it. If there are now sweet jumps in the next vid I'm unsubscribing...
U know that u got money to do these thing. just destroying a 400k car
Oh man. Please do a Rolls Royce next😂
Glad to see someone actually putting in the use that a vehicle needs thanks
8:20 some random kid climbing mount chilliad in his zentorno in gta online
Hemos sido engañados jjj
This looks like real life Forza Horizon. Everyone just randomly mobbing a Ferrari offroad for no reason at all. I love it lol!
That army suit 😆
Not gonna lie that ending was great. Was hoping for an opened can of yellow paint to be thrown
Why does this remind me of HowToBasic
straight from gta v server
I was 200% expecting to see him catch on fire while driving it. Ferrari sucks.
W
My brother, you are a monster, keep doing what you are doing, you have broken all the laws, keep going, creator 😂😂😂😂
@12:20 😭bro just yeeted the broom and the scream dude made me laugh 💀

Lamborghini looking at this video and trying to sell you the hurrican sterrato for your off-road antics 😂 they won’t sue
Active subscriber , that sounds almost good 😀😈😈😈😈😉
How many ladders you got bro
Great video 😭😭
I don't mind seeing you throw around expensive cars that is what there made for and it's great to see but why stand on the hood if u wanna damage the roof find a way to roll it over😂😂
Nice but how's it do on wagon wheels?
He plays life like I play Forza.
REAL LIFE FORZA HORIZON 👀
It means that they're selling stuff in police issue body bags , those bags are strong 💀💀💀😎😎😎😈😈😈😈😈, that's a neat Ferrari 😀😀😀😀
Good boy
The spy balloon comment lmao
You should take a really expensive car and go to demolition derby
i sometimes wanna know how much money this guy actually has to offord this kind of stuff
Best video yet.
most expensive car bubble ad ever
The police and morgues made strong body bags for 400 000  dollars .😀😀😀😀😀😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😉😯😯💀💀💀💀💀💀
Awesome stuff
Realizing is that he is actually a good driver lol
First words that comes to mind when I see/read or hear the word Ferrari is "Fat Italian shit pasta box" . As an I-tie I can say that because my fat Italian family costs as much as a Ferrari but the same quality too so its all shit.
where da kaboom :(
The Doug “THIS” was perfect
Really good commercial for the car bubble. After seeing this I wanted to buy one for myself even tho I don’t have a Ferrari hahah
Sling shot it
Cody of all the things in the world this by far the worst idea you ever had. Good luck
Pov: me in forza trying to get somewhere
Can you make me a present🎉 a car pls 😔
Just owning the car is a lawsuit lol 😂 I’m dead
Imagine your job was to buy expensive cars and try the hell out to try to tear it up. You are living in my dream world.
Cody, a man of the people
POV: you’re smiling the entire video and glad this content exists
🦅
🎉
😂😂😂

He’s playing forza horizon in real life🤣
LOVE IT! Keep em' coming Cody.
RIP imagine knowiat is money ... Money has no value .. If I could drive a car like this :/

Yu should totally let Jamari have this Ferrari 🚗
Ngl that bubble did way better then I expected…
Make sure all of y’all like the videos so he can buy more of them 😆😆
You only live once  yolo
What ever happened to your court case?
your vids soo fxcking goooooooood!!!!
I saw the ending of this video being used as promo content for that bubble 😂
Forza in real life 😂
what’s funny is Ferrari is actually very good to their customers when they aren’t doing stupid shi
HORSE BUGGY WHEEL TIME!!
I love that you did this. Fugggggg Ferrari! Lol they’re dikkkks!
Everything wrong with society today in one short video.  Perfect.
Damn bro. I hope there will be ferrari vs hilux video. I mean it has that skit plate.
I just want to know how many people you had throwing stuff at the end? So damn funny. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why is this so HARD to watch 😂😂
Bro pulled up looking like a gta character 6:00 and was whipping it around like 1😂😂😂😂
How.many fu$#in ladders you guys got in that garage!?!?!? Bubble scene had me crying 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
This how you drive a sport car 😎
This was secretly a ladder commercial
I keep thinking is this a real video?!? I love Cody doesn’t care what the car cost.
this shouldnt make me this happy, If you ever dont want the car you could defnatle donate it to me
Lamborghini car cover 😂 🤦‍♂️👍
Your videos are funny man! I love them!
Now sell me the Ferrari for 2500$
cool
the muffin sheet killed me!
I’m kidding blow it up hahahahahaha
Ferrari watching this be like: 👁️👄👁️
Feel like Ferrari will end up suing they sue for any little thing
That’s the best tunnel in Nashville for pulls😎
all your videos where you just tear up amazing things for your entertainment............ is fucking awesome!
I've said a million times that if a car company truly wants their products tested for real world applications, send them to WhistlinDiesel. Forget crashing them into blocks or other vehicles in the factories, that tells us nothing, other than you have to treat it like a princess! I buy a vehicle to be used AND abused, not bubble wrapped sitting in a climate controlled environment. Once someone "BUYS" a car (take notice Elon Musk) it is theirs, it is not rented so if they do something to it that "YOU" do not approve of, they should not be punished. If that is the case (Elon Musk) give the fvcking money back. As for Ferrari they need to get in, hold on, shut the fvck up!  Please take notice I made my comment before I saw the Bubble thing.
looks like Cody won a surplus military case auction.
I actually need the link to that bubble that thing sturdy
😆😂👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
You should put wagon wheels on it
Legendary content!!! ❤❤❤
You forgot the kitchen sink.
Man is fuckin playing forza irl

That bubble thing at the end actually held up a lot better than I expected lmfao.

This made me want to buy a Ferrari even more they are really durable 😊🥹😆
13:18. I genuinely think that's the hardest I've laughed in a very long time. -Recovering depressed alcoholic veteran.
Laughed out load when you asked for a hammer haha
End of video….I’m not cleaning that up.
This guy has the greatest videos
Americans drive trucks off-road   Mexican Americanos drive there sports cars off-road no off road Wheels  America. Shows up in the country in a sports car and ask guys  in trucks for  a race 🤣.
😂😂😂😂❤
literally anyone in forza horizon when they buy something fancy
Please keep destroying the shit out of this !!!!!!!!!!Lol
Forza irl
Now I love your content but isn’t Ferrari one of them car companies that’ll tell you to fuck off next time you try to buy a car if you do this type of stuff?
This is a daddy's boy with a very unbalanced money-brain ratio. If his parents had given him some time and love, the poor devil wouldn't spend so much time trying to get attention and being a jerk.
I have never felt so much pain...
Where can I find this plastic ballon which care the car?
Ferrari rn: 👁️ 👄 👁️ ✍️ 👨‍⚖️
Bro playing gta in IRL
really is more resistant than i imagined
Forza in real life
Ferrari can suck it. Lawsuit money is what pays for the F1 team
A flamethrower a knife
new forza trailer looks sick
The Chinese balloon did for me. Drive it like you stole it son 👍🏼
He had to be careful there 😂😂😂
I swear if ferrari makes a lawsuit out of this and blacklists him.....
Bro u could have just gave that damn car to me shit. What a waste 🤣
I WOULD LOVE TO TAKE IT HOME 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
WE LOVE IT!!!! (I assume this was only the trailer for the whole widescreen 3 hour movie)
CAN I HAVE IT
I love the way you fix all the cars so well if i had a shit box like that i would  give it to you to fix up 🥹
Tbh I think you missed a couple sections of the durability test. Your going soft on us. Step it up sir 👏🏽👏🏽
Forza Horizon in a nutshell
Tune in next time for “jumping a Ferrari over a Lamborghini”
I beg u to stop
Would you buy me a lambo so I can “destroy it”please
No he’s getting a law suit for putting a Lamborghini cover on it in the beginning
Dude playing forza in real life 😂
When they just stated throwing shit at the bubble 😂😂
U should try throwing  an engine  block from 3meters height
Forza Horizon 5 IRL
I like it,I love it. I want some more of it!
that was top 3 youtube vids I ever watched. congrats!
Day later @superspeedersRob "Caught my customer stealing my Ferrari FA exhaust and ruined paint shop."
Ngl that kinda hurt to watch yet it was funny asf can't wait for Ferrari to sue you 😭😭
Thats the single best ad for that bubble thing that company could ever fucking have.
If I had money to blow Id honestly do this to, just cause you can ya know. Im like what a waste but then again Id be the first to do it if I had money to blow.
I'm pretty sure this is the greatest video I've ever seen in my life! Way to go diesel!
Kids in africa could have eaten that ferrari :(
This channel is going down hill.  Same type of video every single time.
13:17 was awesome 👍👍👍👍
You make me so mad
Who threw the muffin pan😂😂😂
I can just imagine the CEO's siting watchin this video speechless sipping espressos trying to come up with ways to punk this guy
I usually don’t like these types of videos when you destroy a car but I found myself laughing and giggling the whole time. That was hilarious and I was able to watch the whole video through
I usually don’t like these types of videos when you destroy a car but I found myself laughing and giggling the whole time. That was hilarious and I was able to watch the whole video through
Can I have it?
Love it
💗
The ladders got me crying laughing just woke my girl up 😂😂😂💀💀💀💀😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💀💀😂💀😂💀😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Maybe you should play darts next to it
How the f uck are they going to sue you for doing whatever you want with your own property? They can fuck right off
He drivin like in forza horison xD
Yo that bubble protector is damn impressive wth. 🎉😂
really missed out on a good one by not throwing the kitchen sink at it
Love it.  Watching that car go up that hill was amazing
the last part had me wheezing
Thats actually impressive 😅😅 a red car survived 😲😲 like 99% intact after one video 😲😲
I wonder what he’s gunna buy after is it gonna buy the Bugatti Veyron to fucking completely destroy the stupid thing I hope so
Please send me the steering wheel when you’re done with it 😭😭
I'll be waiting for the full story on Vinwiki
That bubble thing is damn impressive , was really thinking it was gonna be shit at first lol
One of my dream cars 😭😭
I kind of want you to lift the Ferrari and put tracks on it 😂😂😂😂
8:00 me in forza when i have no idea how to get back on track lmao
Solid review not gonna lie
13:23 TLC match
Honestly didnt expect the video to go the way that it did but am glad the bubble withstood, thats one tough bubble.
I work as Ferrari management and they saw your video.... They are not happy!
1st video I ever put on repeat.  Bro don't miss,  I love the fact that I never have to worry about skipping through these videos.  Keep up the hustle bro.
I nEeD aN sUv BeCaUsE tHe RoAdS aRe BaD
That’s gotta be fun as hell to beat on
He has done it!!
Love this!  Cars are replaceable. Since the beginning; “This truck means nothing to me” stickers, to now, he can drive most super cars better than weekend track racers.  They spent so much time and effort making the money to own a super car,  while WD spent all his time and effort making videos, testing, and ripping the vehicles.  He knows what he’s doing, even if he’s doing it in reverse. It’s successful.  Keep it up!
That's it, I want a spy balloon.
STOP BANGGING THE CARE DUDE
By far the best content creator ever! Keep it up Whistlin! I think you should throw a duramax in the ferrari....
That's awesome!
HILARIOUS!!
Bruh i wouldnt do this to my 2000$ car, this is just crazy to Watch 😂
Umm,... It's still drivable.  Maybe you should test it's durability against a car shredder.
this dude has no feelings
the jeep wangler with the hellcat engine next 👀
Disrespectful Spoiled Prick
Big flappa rarri 1:05 😂
You should go old school and put a bunch of spacers and mud tires on it 🤣
now that it's destroyed, can I have it for free? I can also afford to pay a quid - since it's all broken and stuff
Bro is playing GTA in real life
show me that w204 you got back there
I want one
It's just a very informal sales ad for Ferrari and that bubble thing
Forza horizon IRL.
Diesel playing forza irl
This  could become the world’s first squatted Ferrari
Fiji water is expensesive, why are you waste it?
they let him buy a ferrari?
Wow the bubble can repel bullets 😳 13:34
Spitting on a ferrari is definitely a lawsuit my friend
This is every man dreams
If anything you just sold that bubble thing lmaooo
I hope there is more to this series of the Ferrari
Craziest SOB in the game right there!!😆
I love Ferrari cars. And I'm not mad at all.. I freaking love this. Use that SOB and let's see how much abuse a Ferrari can take... Idk may e co.pare it to the Helux
Take it to dirt fish rally school
Literally Forza Horizon IRL 😂
This video make me smile so much but also make me wince at even my truck I can't afford to fix lmao
this reminds me of me going offroading in supercars in gta
the ferrari is more durable than I thought and that car protector works nice, that was a good commercial. lol
Funny funny funny 😂
This is just a really good ad for Ferrari. They should be thankful.
fuck a cease and desist ferrari is gonna send hitmen against guy 😭
Ayeee my boy tuner world got a shoutout😭
now i'm laughing even more when i see people driving 3km/h when there is a bump
Had to watch this before they sue the diesel out your name 😂
The Doug Demuro “THIS….” was perfect
That bit at the end was hilarious. How many people did it take to do that constant throwing of stuff?
Dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge!
Ferrari CEO’s watching this 👁👄👁
I mean honestly Ferrari should pay you for the R&D
Notice how no one is offended here but if he attacks a pick up truck and people lose their minds?
We used to say on these people.  What was hard to him, just a born…
Ferrari=Lawsuits Honestly the FD3s rx7 is better
🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂 You're the best that's it ahahhahahhahahahah

This is so painful to watch for me but amazing content like no other 😭 earned my sub
Mr Beast would give away 400k to deserving people so they can have better lives, WhistlinDiesel just completely destroyed a 400k car so people can get sick to their stomach. Great job man! Lol
Stolen Valor

He’s the master of tax write offs
Dude the ending has me cackling SO HARD 🤣🤣🤣
The Ferrari trolls are so good😂
I freaking love this
Dont worry it was venezuelian bolivar
2:42 water bottles have been in many holes but this on has me on ice 💀💀
Al this and i still ask myself when does the tank come to use?
I'm honestly surprised Ferrari let him be a customer tbh
Living his best Forza life lol
Cody is already a legend for me. Man i would love to have pint of beer with you on forest have great  chat and later do some crazy shit together
ronaldo bought a 400k Ferrari and Crashed it

My hero
Keller!
Ferrari’s are trashh!!.
I was literally facepalming like that poor blond kid
Whistling dessil why dont you buy a 942 Fendt and put it to the test, or Is it because you cant afford it.
The ending was a bit mediocre..
Can't wait for ep 2
Finally somebody's drivin' a Ferrari like I do in NFS and Gran Turismo.
Me in Forza.
Not even 3 minutes in and hes craming a water bottle through its air vents, i love it, i aspire to be great like Kody
Lambo cover on the ferrari 😂 he dont give a fvck 🔥❤️
i expected him to actually be kind of careful on the gravel road, but this dude legit just rallied a ferrari
En España decimos que si los tontos volasen no se vería el Sol
Damn i think i leaked some gta 6 stuff
Give it to me after you destroy it chief
Ok are we not going to acknowledge all the other cool cars in the background
Hey Cody, Do Ferrari's fly?
I fucking love you man !!! Lol
I said it once and I'll say again whistling diesel is a legend
Love it
Tommorrow on news. Cody has been killed by italian maffia. 😀
When he asked for a hammer, I feel there was alot of pent up anger released from his colleagues that has been brewing for years 😅
bros playing forza
That’s me on Forza horizon
In all seriousness; could I have that Team Wendy helmet?
Hello i from viet nam
I'm starting to believe this man is living in GTA for real....
OMG 😮 Ferari nice

Bro's lawyer is saul Goodman probably
Next time try to shoot it and leave it as a beauty mark 🤣🤣💯💯💯♨️🚨
They should be thanking you honestly
Nice
Ferrari has its own PMC made to deal with people using their vehicles in a non-advised way
NOW THATS GOOD CONTENT!!
This was so funny🤣
Idiots with much free time
I hope there is a part 2 because I'm not satisfied with this one
I’m literally crying 😂
Your FUCKING nuts , an I love it W ass person
That might be the best ad for that bubble thing in the whole world
Enzo! No!
Money bagss!

aaahhhhhhhhh Kody
As painful it was to watch, it was also the most entertaining thing I’ve ever watched 😭
He was genuinely scared for his life from that hammer
I would love to see him put Reaper wheels on a Ferrari and drive it to a convention with their top execs there to see it 😂😂😂
Make it into a fire place 😂😂
The Doug demuro!!! Lololololol!!! THHHISSSS

Whistlin really trying his best to get a lawsuit against him 🤣🤣🤣🤣

Bro is living a normal gta 5 day
oh man, the things money and clout does to people
Idiot
I hate ferrari policies and their overall snobbiness, but this was kinda hard to watch.
Farrari should be grateful you were so gentle with it
The amount of shit thrown at that bubble was impressive haha
Good 👍 The indestructible clear bubble was the bomb...🤣 Oh man that Ferrari is okay also
Fan fucking tastic cody... superb video 😎👍🍻🙏😇🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I don't believe a lot of cars you destroy have souls, but this one does. Karma out to get you.
yep
That’s what nose lift is for
It needs a duramax and mid tires
This ferrari can helps me to build my future in Morocco, but you just destroyed it 😂😂😂😂 whyyyy
Your going to ruin those tires.
me in forza horizon
I love Ferarri even more now!!!
Honestly first word I do think of is lawsuits LOL used to be red, fast, sport cars.. etc… but they literally sue you if u put a decal on them or custom them in anyway. Screw them
Yo I laughed so hard watching all that shit fly at the end how did u have enough people to throw all that shit lmao
Enzo killed many drivers testing.
I’m at a loss for words! The sarcasm in everything he does, 😂
Come on man. Beat it up ! Took it way too easy on it. Disappointed.
This feels like real life Forza Horizon
Nice :) i dont have money for food 🫣you a lucky man ... 😊
They have to sponsor you with that car cover that was hilarious that really showed the durability of that damn thing
If you can dodge a ball, you can dodge a wrench! hahaha
Woah! That’s a cool, fast sports car!😄👍
Ідіоцький вчинок  Хай заради переглядів👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Welcome to you tube where being an idiot and tearing shit up makes you a millionaire
One of his best vids 😂😂😂😂
This one hurt a bit to watch because im a Ferrari fanboy but at the same time you always deliver great content so gotta love it😂 not many other people would do this so respect to ya
How many fricken ladders do you have?
une honte 😪
painfullll but entertainment like level 90001 go Whistlin!!! love ya style
Mancanza di rispetto per la Ferrari !!💔
Ferrari about to start making off-road f8 Spiders after seeing this
What is he preparing for
Cant think of a better ad for that car bubble than this!
Not even ferrari have tested their suspension like this
Broh, can you give me the ferrari ?
Just literally Forza-Horizon'D  his Rarri! LOVE IT!!!
How about vacuum seal it in the bubble with a hydro vac you know to preserve it for the future 🤔
Car bubble garage company just got a great free marketing campaign 😂
Y'all better watch this while you can! 😂
Hey me and my cousin watch you Everytime you post. We are big fans. And it's really cool to see cars getting destroyed next you should a boat
Bro, thats Power Gaming
Brings me back to the good days of “tax the rich” YouTube channel
One day ill be rich enough to do this
I think a Ferrari colab with WD would be pretty epic
Alright who threw the muffin pan no one’s baking anything in this video ? Haha throw an oven well your at it random 😂😊 13:46
Best commercial ever for that bubble thing!
I will say I am impressed with the cars hillclimbing abilities
What kind of broom was that. I like it.
🤭🤭🤭 11:44  🇨🇳🕵️🎈
Shop looks cold … should heat it up with a wood stove and a few thousand baseball cards
my big Question WHY and why is it so funny😂😂
I think ur videos would be more awsome if y let me drive and destroy the next car🥶
The Ferrari handled the offroad like a treat had me smiling the whole time. Now Ferrari has too legally refer to this car as a rally car because it just did that well
I don’t get why Ferrari would sue if you own the car? You’ve bought with your own money so why should they care what you do with your car???
Are those coolers or like trunks in that big ass stack against the wall? 😂😂
4:09 but the suspension is good
I'm actually really suprised how well that handles on dirt.
Next time throw a brick
Whistlin Diesel you the goat
Didn’t you say the same thing about the lambo that still sitting in one piece in the background that you got months ago?
This is one of the best videos EVER!!! 🤣🤣🤣
At last. Sensible car for sensible owner.
4:41 is the best part of the video😂😂😂, I felt that when he hit that lambo💀
this guy😂😂
Doug Demuro made an appearance, lol
😂
Well I mean it’s not a sf90 but still a nice car forsure..
“I hope it’s not red.” 😂
Koenigsegg review soon?
why are you destroying the poor ferrarie!
Like gta5
How about a gooseneck ball and do a towing test 😆
U r the coolest freakin guy buying expensive super cars to destroy it bruh u literally gta life
Have to admit, this was a hard video to watch.
When he's driving the Ferrari on his property it looks like someone on a Chernarus ARMA III modded server. And he's wearing military gear.
I love this. This will go down in history to be the “Diesel v Ferrari” incident.
Show this to those idiots at GTA RP saying off-roading a super cars is unrealistic driving
The muffin pan makes this video
In some alternate universe:   Ferrari marketing agents: Guys we have to create a new Rally car like the 308 GTB!!! (B group)
Man I would do the same
Whistlin diesel is out here playing real life forza
That’s not real it an RC car!
This reminds me of the TaxTheRick100 videos.
Must be a trilogy..
2nd on trending now lol
omg what a vid man
Hope he got that mors mutual
he literally is giving ferrari the middle finger
Ferrari cease-and-desist coming your way lmao
You are actually helping me get over my unhealthy desire for nice things
Me in gta v be like
I kinda want the bubble now.
I like wqth he did with the car good tests 10
Ferrari with a Lamborghini cover 😂

Dude😬
ferrari needs to leave people alone and let them have fun
What a faggoty flex.. watched for 5 seconds and left, downvoted on the way out.
For the FIRST time Cody. I agree with your decision.   I wrecked my Pantera, an accident, wrecked my 69 trans am, an accident, wrecked my 65 mustang an accident.  I will enjoy watching you destroy that car, and know it's no accident 😜😜😂 Anyway. Best durability test I've ever seen they should pay YOU
my dude is living GTA in real life
Bro playing FORZA in real life 💀
Your video is the best in the world to destroy cars
If you don’t like what people do with the cars you sell, don’t sell cars!
Next test: How much air can you get in a Ferrari?"
If you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a ball
Bro is living life like need for speed
Me playing forza 😅😂
Moi je dit laboiserie fait mieux
Those guys tryna catch their breath at the end!! Just the amount just flying! I think these motors are put into formula 1 hillclimb racing, these "jeeps" are beast at 90 degree cliffs. No way diesel boy can handle that! Fuck the rest of the car, put that motor into something more cool!
How many people did you have behind the camera to throw all those stuff?I even saw crutches.
Bros doing the boss fight
You could call Damon from DDE to do offroad driving in your supercar, that would make epic shots
That is some amazing Ferrari driving footage. I would've never seen a Ferrari out in the green and gravel if it wasn’t for you. Thanks a lot.
Just Why bro :D
Spacers and paddle tires
“ Ferrari” some one get this man a lawsuit
Thumbs up if you think the car bubble makers should sponsor him👍🏻
Me playing forza horizon 5:
4:43 thank you for saying it hahahahaha
Every Ferrari ever made deserves to be obliterated at the hands of Cody.
he should test new cars xD
WhistlinDiesel: time to have some fun  Ferrari: I will sue you  Also whistlin: don’t make me buy another one…..
The company of that bubble needs to pay you for advertising I can see millionaires running to buy one for every car after seeing that 😂 😂 😂
Why😢
4:21 I just found our new meme😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣
if u dont like the car just please give it to me
Me clicking on the video: "well I'll be surprised if he doesn't get a lawsuit."  First thing he say: "what are ferraris known for?.........LAWSUITS 💀💀💀💀💀

Andrew Tates kinda quiet now
At the end man, that shit was hilarious 😂😂😂😂😂

This man is living life
I feel that, when i ask my father if he can throw me a hammer it's always like that....
Can’t believed this was demonetized temporarily, what’s YT thinking, there’s nothing offensive or broke any YT guidelines..sHame on YT…SMH..glad it’s back… I can watch it numerous times.
I can't believe you spent all that money on Fiji water to waste it🙄
100% worth waiting so funny waiting for pt.2
You can probably buy a piece of the jar soon in a jar 😂

This entire video looks like something out of FH5

Was actually HIGHLY impressed with the off road capabilities of the Ferrari 😅🍻 Also surprised on how well @WhistlinDiesel Bubble Wrap did versus his entire garage of stuff 🤣🤣🤣
Sinampal na naman ako ng kahirapan 😓  Honda click na motor di ako makabili o kahit hulugan, tapos dito Ferrari sinisira lang 😅
Good luck in the future, Bud
Gta 5 irl
You are the best Your video’s are funny
First I saw a Laferrari and honestly went fumming but then realized its "just"  F8 and became cool about it 😄
Where the video ends is not realy good.Super funny video❤😂😂😂😂😂😮😮😅

Mud truck Ferrari build
i’m glad doug got his cameo
Rezvani vengance durability test?
Bro you throw away more money in 1 video than I'll probably make in my entire life and I love it.
Buy a motorcycle
#1 on trending let’s gooooo
This hurt my soul watching this
Can i get the scraps tho (worths 10k)
the ending was insanely funny
Half of me is absolutely demolished by such brutal behaviour with the car but the other half keeps reminding me of the reasons Ferrari is so hated
I want to see him drive it around with the excavator. like what he did to the r32😂
I'm convinced there's a whole cleanup crew this man has for after every video lol
You're just brag of having a lot of money. Is simply…. sad. What a waste of life pal
Bro rlly needs to stop
Watching whistlin diesel these days is like gta 5
lmao use to watch ur videos but crazy how u waste all this money for views when u could actually be making positive changes or anything else 😭
Bro wrapped Rari with Lambo
"How do i convert GTR in jars in to 400,000 BRAND NEW Ferrari"
best ferrari commercial ever
Bro you went full gta online on the Ferrari Ferrari is Def gonna sue yo ass an this is coming from a 14 year old who is poor asf
CODY'S A COMEDY KING 👑!!
wow thats a cool fast sportscar
he said he’ll do this back then💀💀Cody’s an absolute legend for this
this was so damn funny the 2:35 corvette joke 😭  2:50 and the water bottle
His having a Ferrari is far more fun than me having one.
how rich is this guy?
Its heartbreaking how stupid and ungrateful you are destroying a dream cars of a million people and thinking it’s funny ….
I don’t know if he knows how hilarious he his
Looks exactly like Forza Horizon
I love the ending lol
I could have sworn this video was taken down💀 cause i saw it then when i wanted to watch it a couple hours later i couldn't find it
Show farrari. Who's Boss.   Hell yea
I have a new favourite youtube video.
Im actually impressed by Ferrari. I thought it would break like instantly. And IM also surprised that you didnt destroy the car. Good job!
Plz stop it hurts to c this 😭😭
He’s gonna end up on Ferraris black list
I love this he stuck it to Ferrari so hard.
This guy will either totally reinvent himself in the future or commit suicide...watch
Next video: "How i got suied by Ferrari..."
“Quiet down, I’m trying to see where I’m goin!”
Great advertisement for the car and bubble cover love it
I love you
FORZA HAHAHAH
This is why you wanna meet the previous owner of a car so you don't buy from a donk like this
That ending DEFINITELY completed this video lmao!!
Ferrari are probably more impressed with the F8 being off road capable 😂😂
Finally 👌 worst car ever..
This is a classic school example of "how not to do it". This person shows symptoms of mania and psychosis. The person who recorded this video will never be a good friend, husband, or father. A person who does not respect another person, their creativity, or their hard work, even he paid for it.  A person who is able to step over corpses for viewership. Do yourself a favor, forget about this channel, and thank me via Western Union. P.S. This is the professional opinion of a psychiatrist and school psychologist
ok that last part was hilarious 😂
taxtherich vibes
I never see you do a give away to some in people remember we mak you dis for. feed the in need  🙏
13:50 did I hear gun noises?
“Hey give me a hammer” everything in the shop starts flying 😂😂😂😂😂
very impressive keep up the good work guys
This Forza Horizon 5 real life edition 😄
Tax the Rich is somewhere smiling
on some GTA TYPE SHIT
😂👍
But why?
Will it stop a anvil
Bro getting band from ferrari
I need a YouTube following so I can do cool stuff like this…. Keep up the cool vids 👌😎👍
My man now tore up a Ferrari I going to be honest I would to if they trued to sue me for driving wrong👍🇺🇸😂
The barrage of shit being thrown at the Ferrari all at once will have me laughing for days.    Thank Whistlin Diesel, funniest moment yet.
🖐🏽🖐🏽🖐🏽🖐🏽🖐🏽
Wait...  That bubble is pretty sick df
I bet a kitchen sink would have got it.
MAN this car sounds AMAAAZING!
I was going to watch this video yesterday but never got around to it. Finally had time to watch it and someoneeee took the vid down, seems like it’s back though :)
Please STOP Playng Forza horizon!
I could not stop smiling and laughing during this video😂. Ferrari executives are probably having a stroke right now
This is some Forza horizon type sht.
Those comments about the used 458 and “broke boy” how is bro broke when he had owned more vehicles then they ever will in their life
why
Gotta love a yota recovery vehicle just waiting to save a ferrari
GTA 6 graphics look really good!!!
put it in a scrap machine.. i double dog dare you
Damn dude🤣
Honestly he’s a really good driver
Honestly Ferraris are not all that. Ive gotten to drive some VERY high end cars in my life (thanks to rich clients) and while the Ferraris I drove certainly were magnificent... The cost of ownership, reliability issues (I feel they spent more time in the shop then on the road) and their hilarious paranoia of how their customers use THEIR PROPERTY is insane. MY CAR, MY freaking property. Blow me.
Any malayalees here 👀
forza irl
6:00 is literally every GTA 5 lobby 😂.
Fucken brilliant drive it like it's yours hell yea
,
Bro woke up and choose violence 😂😂
retard is writen all over his face
No eres más tuntu por qué no te entrenas
45 Italian men had heart attacks while watching everything in the shop fly at the air bag on the Ferrari 😂.  That thing is sick off road. Maybe fight a modern general Lee and do a dirt track race 🤔
If I were you I’ll probably try rolling down from the hill and feels the experience of it. It will be awesome and wanna see more content of that. 🔥🥰👍
He’s actually crazy fr
13:17 😂 I love the bubble part
Nobody in their right mind would ever do this. Top Tier Entertainment!
5:47 tht was clean😮‍💨
Destroy Harley Davidson bro😅
Hell yeah 😎👊
Don't you think helping some  poor bastard in Biden's America a little more helpful and fun than throwing away a half million dollars. Ya I get it, it's your money. I would build some houses for homeless vets or help someone out with something, anything. How about all the animals dieing in Palestine Ohio. I live in Ohio and we are just farmers we don't have a ton of money to help anyone we can barely breath in this new America. But you do you brother we still love you content and admire your hard work. See ya brother.
I don't understand how much he makes a month?
and im eating once a day  :D
Carefull with that boy, Ferrari can cease you Tu buy anymore cars from them.
Ferrari commercials be like
I shat my pants at the end. The bubble part is the funniest thing I have seen In a long time 😂
Dude this shit is wild
Someone has to do it.
He’s real life living gta5
Jesus Christ Of Nazareth 🤦‍♂️
Dude just fulfilled every forza horizon player's dream. Driving an exotic car off road.....
My dream has always been to get rich and destroy a Ferrari. Although I’d want to destroy it in the parking lot of the dealership but everybody is a little different.
Ferrari didn't like the purrrari and idk if they will like this 😂😂
I re-officialy love Cody
It's so ironic that Ferrari sues everyone to save their image and by doing so they ruined their image completely. It makes me so happy you're gonna destroy this. Fun fact Jay Leno doesn't own a Ferrari because of bad tactics
Beautiful.....
Yes, fuck the haters and turn it into a rallycross 😅
Taxtherich but on steroids
https://youtu.be/w9KR4-U_8YU
Only a complete fucking moron would sell this guy a vehicle....making Ferrari the dumbest car manufacturer of all time
Now he is blacklisted
This video genuinely made me feel unwell, I've never felt emotions quite like it.
It's like Need for Speed in real life haha
This should be the sales video that Ferrari puts up to sell the F8.  Who needs 4wd...its a tank with the body of a supermodel and the heart of the swamp people.  Impressive performance with 0-60 in who cares.
I need to see a Ferrari on tracks… the ferrari FU, I can see the lawsuit already it would be beautiful
No respect for the car 👎👎
Dude u need to destroy a house by driveway nt a bulldozer thought it.  Or turn lose a shit load of termites in a house
This guy 😂 I love it
Dingas
Love the Lamborghini cover😂
Can I have the motor if it survives?
Comedy Gold
Haha thank you
I need the's car
How many people caught the spy baloon reference. F**king brilliant.
earfasdrzhsdfaečrtsdfsretzghsdfg
While I've never had the means to buy a new vehicle and so I buy certified or used, and live a modest lifestyle, on the one hand it is understandable to get frustrated by his lack of care for waste, but on the other hand the value shown for pointing out that it's just stuff and he clearly shows the irony in clinging to prized possessions and how bent out of shape people get so easily offended. I'm ashamed to watch his content while at the same time a little satisfied at seeing someone take the path that many people find so offensive and against the grain. Gets me every time.
The Doug Demuro was great!
Hahahahahaha
Next destroy 2 tesla
In the meantime people are starving or dying.  What a waste of money.
I'm happy he's going to wreck it there junk  c8 will out live anything that comes from Italy
Naaaaaice
2022 ferrari formula 1 season
Imagine all the good this guy COULD do instead of just being a tool.
2:31 I passed away from laughing. The c8 is a disgusting brick of a vehicle. God bless you Cody.
ant 13:25 me wen iam trying to find my 10 m socket
does anyone have a link to buy the duck that he had on his army shirt?? I really really friking want that
WHAT A BEAUTY. HE'S SICK (MENTALLY AND PHYSICAL LOOK AT HIS ROTTEN SKIN) HE'S GROWN UP JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES, YOU KNOW SEXUALLY FRUSTRATED ETC. KARMA WILL TAKE CARE OF HIM!!
My anxiety shot through the roof at the end… thank you for another great vid!
😍😍😍
I don't know what I'm impressed more of the Ferrari doing all that stuff or the fact he bought a bubble for the car and threw the whole shop at it. I laughed a little to hard! Awesome content as always 👌🏼 🤣
Am I seeing things or was that demo ranch making a cameo 😂
Do a durability test and destruction on a Toyota AE86 TRUENO.
Fill the hole with concrete for more front traction
Italians cringing in the corner
Forza Horizon 4 in real life ...)
From breaking old toyotas to breaking ferraris - our boy made it

So ridiculous, hope you get a cease and desist

Whistlin diesel - step away from that Beautiful car
whisteling diesel: they must of installed this skid plate when your rock crawling -2023-
I'm in tears right now😭😭😭
i will say this ferrariiii sounds amazing
THAT GRINDING SCENE LOL
man's literally playing forza irl
Bro I  hate you 4 this😂💙
That you even think that any company can sue you for buying their product and brake it shows that you can become rich with YouTube when you are not really smart. But hey the Internet kids will like and jump on it. So if Ferrari sues you it’s for making false statements
Good advertisement at the end lol
The only thing you didn’t throw at the bubble protector was the kitchen sink. Probably the only thing that would have defeated it! Note: just bought shares in this indestructible bubble protector as sales are about to jump 10 fold!
A Hole
Bro literally throw a whole garage at farrari
You forgot to throw a tool box at it. How do we know if the bubble is rated for a tool box? 🤔😂
Button: OMG
Another mother's son who doesn't care about ecology and wastes his money for the buzz ...
The standard Ferrari BS from Americans, Ferrari sues you when you use/abuse their name and logo not for being just a dumb American raping a Ferrari, they would be suing 24/7 if they did that
Wow 👍
Enzo definitely rolling in his grave right now
Dude is gonna get banned from buying another one
It was weird seeing garand thumb in this video.
co za orangutan
der Hammer !!!
This is the quality content I love to see from Cody genuinely a funny video
🍿💀
Next video: I bought an $28M Rolls Royce boat tail just to destroy it.
Koeniggseg is that one brand who makes cars just extremely solid, and they really test their limits
What...even. Did I just watch... Intentionally crashing into things just to show how rich you are? Wow. I mean. Kinda lost for words here.
With ur money u should be destroying some houses I'd like to see u do one of those
Love it❤️❤️❤️❤️
When did you get the landcruiser 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
🤘❤❤❤
He did donuts with it  https://youtube.com/shorts/8WfNkT_ixx0?feature=share
Stupid Kiddies with too much Money (from Daddy) and absolutely no Driving skills.
He is the Driver Guy who uses his Car to have fun
Jesus, this man is determined to enforce the first amendment on everyone, and I respect the shit out of that.
Looks like TaxTheRich100 old videos =D
What a fucking piece of shit car, completely deserves it and more 🤣🤣
We need Pt 2 !!! 👌🏻👌🏻😍
Get 10x FSO Polonez and ruin it
Whistlindiesel is back
Convinced this was a ad for the bubble 😂
🤣🤣🤣
The company for that bubble is going to use that as a commercial 💀
First "YouTuber" video I've ever watched!  So cool that he does what other won't dream of doing!!  Keep up the creative work and keep having fun!
Serious. Where did you buy that car bubble from, that’s strong asf..!
Felt slightly offended in the first 10 seconds braddah diesel would even  think to wreck a Ferrari!  Soon got over that and was smiling for the rest of the video.
Stupid very stupid😠🤮🤮🤮🤮
he actually proved how good that Ferrari is
should've thrown the kitchen sink at it
This is a good guide on how to get banned by Ferrari. 💀
The only time u see a Ferrari drifting up a gravel road outside of Forza Horizon
This reminds me of “TaxTheRich100” and his old videos doing this shit with rolls Royce’s and a Ferrari Enzo, and all that 😂🤣
all gta fivem admins pushing air rn
Didn't skip to the end because I don't want to believe
Did I hear shots 😭🤣
Number 2 on trending in one day
if ferrari sees him doing this, he must be blacklisted from buying ferrari cars, because ferrari is very sensitive
The Huracan cover had me laughing from the start
Im going to finally agree with you. FUCK  FERRAIE
i do this shit in forza... he does it IRL
You are acutely really good driver.
Probably the best Ferrari advertising video made in decades.
just 3mins in and i love it
Those Ferraris are the real deal
I was in the market for a Ferrari but after watching this display I will no longer be considering the purchase at all.
Favorite video yet
al si ti debil
What's more durable? A Ferrari or a Hilux? Let's find out.... :)
i laughed too hard at the driver warning joke
That was awesome!
impressed by the amount of things thrown at the air setup...
Should drop the excavator bucket on it
One of the best sound cars ever
Bro is playin forza in real life

Ferrari won’t sue,he just showed how durable this model actually is lol.  Also help sell that bubble car protector 😄
Now this is sick!
Love that day 1 of WD testing this Ferrari has probably seen more gravel roads and off roading than any other Ferrari in history.
Real life gta

Saying that you actually care about your cars is just as true as saying Biden is amazing president
needs a durability test video
This guy deserves more views than MrBeast🤝🏼end of story.
Yup you did what I told you not to do. U destroyed a skyline and I mentioned, if you did that to a Ferrari they would sue your a$$.
Respectable!!!
This is IRL Forza Horizon 5 lol
This pissed me off
Bro give me please these wheels or some parts
What a fucking, pathetic CLOWN... Obviously you didn't buy this car (or anything in your life) by yourself, so its unlikely to respect the ammount it costs, as well the brand itself. Attention whore at its best.
The ending was funny asf I expected a hammer not every throwable thing in the garage 😂😂😂😂
Look at all those fun boxes😍😍
That car looks so much cooler off road!
Honestly thank you so much @WhistlinDiesel for doing things no one else will.
That car bubble sales are going skyrocket soon hahaha
He is the definition of money is fake
I remember seeing a picture of a lambo with a lift kit and big tires , he should do something like that
I can only hope that one day I’ll be in a position to own as many ladders as WhistlinDiesel.
hahah 💪💪bossman
Is my screen fucked up? Whys WD look like he has jaundice lol. Is he tanning
you are a dumba$s with your cars... but I love it
😳😳😳😳😳😳 brother man got the whole COD Inventory of every game ever made. I'm hot and horny.
Bro made a minute commercial for the product without even realising
Part 2????
Loved the bubble at the end the stuff just kept on coming can just imagine 4 or 5 guys standing behind camera with random stuff haha 😄
He’s trending 🤧🔥
Lack of respect but it’s his money.
So many youtubers make so much money and your the only youtuber to actually make content out of the money you earn.
lmao, how many people did yall have throwing shit at the end there? That was actually pretty impressive!
I wanna know how that consistently threw like 3 things at a time at the bubble, how many people were back there lol
Pov ferrari after watching this video 😡😡😡😡👮🏻‍♂️🤬🔫💥
As much as i say yesh, its unseen footage. You aint never seen a ferrari having fun.
This guy is corny
❤
Lift Kit like The new Porsche 911 Dakar rallye!!
For any haters, he’s just doing Forza in real life 🤷🏽‍♂️
Cody!!!
#1 trending hell yeah. i wonder how much concrete that trunk can hold?
That car is actually so sexy
anyone know the name of the military boxes in his shop?
Holy shit did anybody notice his collection in the back?
😂😂😂😂😂☠️☠️☠️ the way bro aggressively flip the page while reading a book in utter disappointment 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 to you're delinquent behavior that somehow has a way with meaning purposefulness. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Oh God that was beautiful.
Link to the ''protective bubble" please
Definitely needs meats on the rear for grip in dirt
Don’t mind the Ferrari G men on your doorstep tomorrow
Ferrari is getting that sinking feeling that you get that a 400000 dollar car is getting bullied my man just pure content
This is some shit i'm doin on forza💀😂
Fuck Ferrari. I hope they start a legal battle and he just starts another war.
I honestly damn near prayed for the Doug reference
The end was insane I almost peed in my pants while laughing 😂😂😂😂
13:18 GOLD
Imagine if you seen some dude doing this and he wasn’t making a video, you would think that dude is really nuts lol
Go back to destroying $5k cat eyes snd stuff. Something just isn't right about totalling supercars out.
Omg the ending lmfao
dudes a gta 5 online character with the off roading and outfit
Amazing job of prepping the roads on the farm to be smooth enough for the F8.  The amount of work with a road grader and sheeps foot would be a great video in itself.  I loved the extreme vertical hill climb, that was so smooth, I think an F1 car could of gone up it too!
I legit saw the part where they throw shit at the bubble on my reels this morning without knoing that this video was out and was like "That's some whistlindiesel type of shit" and then I'm greeted with this... The man has gone insane 😐
As a ferrari fanboy since 2007 I approve this video
Good
wow  can i have that red jeep please
I love this dude zero fucks given 😂
This is the best Ferrari vid i have ever seen
Smoking that enzo pacc😤
That's one hell of a sponsor 🤣🤣🤣
Video is great 👍 love how you treated this over priced piece of crap that's turned into good like status, it's just a stupid car
Yoo people out here need help and you can give that money too random fans my guy . RESPOND TO ME BRO !
This is unfathomably based
Cody just has that f u money
yes, you are an i.d.i.o.t !
Damn dawg you selling those cases?
Illegal!!! I don’t care. It made me smile. Lol. Because it’s a Ferrari.
Lmao I seriously cannot wait to see what happens on the next video with this Ferrari. It took like 3 videos for the helicopter to get wrecked to shit so we'll see!
13:17 pov when you clean out that random  drawer you're in your house 👁️👄👁️
Dude. You’re literally playing forza horizon in real life. That’s a dream. Also you’re pretty ducking good at drifting those banks.
This totally needs a lift kit and monster truck wheels.
so thats how they get the sounds for forza 5
I just love watching him enjoy his money he earned grinding. I would love to do some donuts like that in a Ferrari and get ferraris panties in a bunch
The dumb thing about Ferrari is that when you buy the car it's yours and you can do whatever you want to it an the car should not be taken by the company Ferrari because they don't like what you did to it. Also if they take it away you should get your money back.
This Ferrari dosent matter becuase your x kidnapped your children becuase she thought she could get rich off the government chargeing you for there living expenses.  AM I RIGHT ?!?!?!?! That's the same reason Russia decided to defend Ukraine.
That bubble was impressive!
Man that bubble thing at the end held up really good 👍
Ferraris are Red 🔴 But there balls just turned Blue 🔵
that bubble test was amazing
This man is literally playing forza horizon
typical forza rally race tryhard
from 13:18 just set 2x speed for more fun
That bubble thing is genuinely impressive
What’s next Maclaren wink wink
This is literally me in gta
For some reason I felt like the Ferrari motor was crying before being bought…” no not him” “I seen what we does with these cars” 😭😭😭
Best Supercar content on YouTube
When he started driving up and he hit the fence 🤣🤣🤣 I spit my water out
And this is just the start 🤌🏽

He was driving down the paths like he was looking for a barn find in Forza Horizon 🥺
Why the fuck everyone seems to enjoy it...
For Sale Ferrari F8, Low Miles, Garage Kept! Lol
I wanna see an unboxing episode of those cases..
this car need paddle tire
If the car bubble is not a sponsor next video it’d a be greatly missed opportunity 😂😂
this is just disrespectful
Reminds me of tax the rich
Buys a Ferrari to destroy it. Ends video with the Ferrari in one piece in a protective bubble.
Yanks arn't the brightest folk . Get $400.000 in cash & burn it !
the end reminded me of the wrench war. time Flys.  how funny would it be to end the video stuff still coming at it untill you upload again  when you back it out from under all the $hi+. good stuff man getting paid to keep things nice as a business expense  lol your gonna work you way up to a Bugatti
Buy a koenigsegg next
*F8 Sales after this* 📈📈📈
That’s how you use a car
At this point you need personal bodyguards i dont think they are sending lawers
So when are we gonna see some real damage because we know red means dead
HAHAHAHA!! 😂😂😂😂
This man’s playing forza horizon irl
this entire video was just an ad for the air bubble
He shoulda lifted it
He's playing Forza in real life 🥺
Lol the end had me dying!! How many of you were throwing shit at it? LOL!!
Should have thrown a sink at the end..I'm disappointed   /sub

You use a Lamborghini cloth to cover a Ferrari?😆
Hmm paint ball durability test I mean it’ll wash offf
#2 on trending! THIS IS EVERYTHING WE HAVE EVER WANTED FROM THIS CHANNEL! I would rather you destroy this car than have it sit in a garage never seeing the light of day!!!
Excellent video! Great laugh 😂
I swear, this man has the most fun of anyone

Send this vid to Ferrari asap 😂

He barely scratched it 😂😂
Take it to a gas station carwash
I was half expecting them to toss Cody at the bubble
you need a doctor
Throw a 2 ton car jack at it 😆, i'm waiting
Hahahaha 😂 this is soooooo coooool man
I love this video couldn't stop laughing and smiling
This is so awesome. I’ve legitimately always wondered how these cars held up 😂
Ferrari for Sale: 3000 miles . Garaged all the time, brand new condition, no damage. Great price
been a rough 72 hours for me, thank you for putting a big smile on my face and forget everything for a little cody
Has keller fallen out with tyler then? That why he with kody now?
Now Imagine it’s a rental 😂
This just reminds me of Forza
Bros playing forza
1:38 I really hope that beautiful Bentley Continental isnt your next victim 😅. The pain would be unbearable.
You are actually helping me get over my unhealthy desire for nice things
this is even fast than my last mix of Beethoven that 'ive put it on my channel hahaha
that F8 looks so fuckin awesome even when its being tortured ❤️❤️ l love it
Mf doing what I do in forza but in real life
Had to come back just to Re like the video after its removal yesterday.   great content
Hello Everyone.. it's almost 2am where I live and I'm on YouTube begging for someone out there to help me.. I'm a single mother of two children that are both under the age of five. They both have physical disabilities thar require full time care. I left my abusive husband after years of physical and verbal abuse. My children were never his target but once that changed I took my children and left as soon as I could without him knowing. We've moved from friend's house to friend's family's house for the last two weeks. I've gone to ask for assistance and did everything I could. Tonight is our last night here and tomorrow we're not going to have a place to stay.. I'm thankful for the help we've been given so far but these families don't have much themselves. My friend signed me up for cahapp so could try getting a loan but I don't qualify for one...  I have nothing else I can do... I'm waiting for assistance that's weeks away and I don't have a place for my children tomorrow night... so here I am begging on YouTube because where else can I find people this late at night? If there's anyone out there that could help me... $dreamingdreamer anything will help..
it's his car, he can do what he wants  But as a car  lover it just hurts my soul and I didn't  enjoy the trashing part, only the off-road part 🥹
some people simply don't deserve to have nice things
I thought the hilux was destroyed? It looks fine to me there, did they restore it or something?
Knowing diesel I expected him to wrap the car around the tree and call Ferrari and tell them about it
I love how he offends people and he doesn't Care 🤣😂
Ale wiesz że ferrari to motherfucker, i zrobią Ci sprawę sądową, i hate ferrari, wyżej srają niż dupe mają, bezlistosna karygodna polityka firmy, dla nich liczy się tylko kasa
Please turn it into merch mulch would luv to watch my friends die inside over the contents
Next up on Samcrac, I just bought the cheapest Ferrari F8 in America.
He's not breaking what can't be fixed. He bought it for 400....make a million off views....sell the leftovers for 100....no sweat.....in the positive for 600....and got to have fun pissing people off while doing it..  ..thats his genious.
This is more of an ad on "Built Ferrari Tough" than anything else tbh lmao
1:25-4:12/14:11. What is the point of this, the effect of drug/drugs or other stimulants?. 🤔 Or is there too much money?.
Crazy to think how much more this car cost than my house
Should of thrown a random underwear to finish off the vid 🤣☠️
When it's so cringe but you can't look away 🫣
This guy is literally doing CJ stuff in real life in which we don't hv the balls to do it🥲
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PLawK-Jjqo
I don't comment often, but this has got to be one of the coolest Ferrari videos I've ever seen
I can’t believe you are babying this thing. You’ve finally gone soft.
Only man to pay off a Ferrari with one video. 🤣🤣🤣
Forza IRL
Can I have the Ferrari for free
At this point give me the Ferrari and i will take care of it 😂😂
2mill views in 1day.... no wonder
This video makes me want to vomit. Do you know how many people you could have helped with 400k?
When are we gonna have super car long jumps?
I can only hate Cody because i cant imagine being able to do what he does. This was Fucking EPIC topped the Mercedes off road video Almost.
My support for destroy this piece of shit is with you diesel
I hope this will send you to the moon!!! 10 mil subs eazy!!!
You are the most beatiful man on this platform!!! I wouldnt do thing any other way!!! You are the MAN!!!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
First thing that comes to mind when I think Ferrari is way over prised garbage
pls make it a Monstertruck
Was more worried about that hilux tbh.
bro is playing gta 6 irl
What if this is the video that gets Ferrari into rally racing.  Cody would become the Christian Bale that Ferrari has always been looking for.
what are the hundreds of sturdy cases in the backdrop
What would you rate it base on Test #1?
Inspirational
Next part asap
I could only do that in GTA
Love it never fails to put a smile onmyface
Got a Nissan ad during this video. Maybe they're telling you something 😂
His video got deleted once he again posted it love this man
Paint it orange, put a 01 on the side, flag on top, and a Dixie horn
Tune in next time for helicopter drop durability test #2 Ferrari edition
"I think that did pretty well, gimme a hammer..."  I'm dying
Some of the peoples in world play GTA in real life.
jesus christ! The bubble bit killed me!  That's legit a good product
Nest of morons here. In a world where we have to save things, where the word "abundance" is definitely a thing of the past, we can see ill-mannered brat rejoicing in the mess they make.  We won't forget... Clearly.
Finally someone treating those overpriced gocarts exactly how they should be 🔥
I wanna destroy something I have always wanted but can't afford. Build caricature and stuff.
You smashed the green lambo glass for a 2 second clip, that’s dedication sir
Put it in the mud hole.
Better than it sitting in a room until the end of time
When are you going to destroy a tesla???
YOU ROCK! END OF STORY. LMFAO 😂
God will punish you for this. You can bet on that. Your arrogance and disrespect will not go unpunished
Love it
One Day you will banned from Ferrari /or other car brand.because you are Dystroing those things And one day will come when God will punish you severely and make you lowly poor for wasting things and wasting money like this.
Why…? It’s heart breaking. I Love these cars, can’t see this torture.
Tax write off for the buisness 🙂
I’m worried
Forza
Why does he have so many ladders😂😂
My guy is playing forza horizon...
Hey what’s in the crates? Can’t wait to see the butt hurt comments about this btw
Forza horizon irl
This is genuine content, even the haters love it
❤❤❤
He is forza
Stupid guy
Bros living in gta💀
clickbait
i’d love to see more Tax the Rich type videos!
"Unfortunately, we do not care"  Need that on a shirt. Except change "we" to "I"
This is so good. Maybe one of the best videos I ever saw.
the ferrari purists definitely screaming 🤣🤣
We need to see how durable the Ferrari is compared to the Hilux. IN MY ARNOLD VOICE " D GRAP THE CHOPPPA"
This looks like a ridiculous amount of fun. I wanna try lol
Dude. This is what the definition of “living the dream” is.
I expected destruction.. im sure we will get it soon enough
Wow amazing 🤩🤩...
I find this video extremely wasteful and irresponsible. It's a shame to see such a beautiful car being destroyed for no good reason. There are so many people in the world who could benefit from that money being put towards something more productive or helpful. This kind of behavior is a sad reflection of the excess and thoughtlessness that sometimes plagues our society.
So this is what its like to play Forza Horizon 3 in real life. Thanks Cody. Just remember if you roll over or get hung up on something press select it will reset the car.
Wtf… where’s part 2?????
Forza in real life
13:30 at this moment, the Ferrari employee who decides about suing just paused the video and called the lawyer!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤯🤯🤯🧨💣Firework in the car😀😀
He just made the best commercial for the bubble company
Bro, I would hate a video like that not made by Whistlindiesel 😂 But I love this one! Smiling a f
homeboy drives his Ferrari how I drive mine in GTA
It's like Forza and Dirt combined I love it 🇺🇲 keep up the good work Cody
Use the crusher to crusher it
Overall, this is an amazing car very durable, Ferrari did a great job if they ever need a durability test, they should show this video.
After all that, you just have to sell it to @hooviesgarage
The ending was just absolutely hilarious.
This is simultaneously hard to watch yet entertaining
You are officially CRAZY  thank you for it
my irl name is diesel 🤔
You do not disappoint! This was gold
I don’t understand how he makes money by destroying expensive cars, even if he uploads 10 videos it wont make 400,000
It's almost Spring, that thing needs a 3 point hitch and a farm implement attached to it..
Please stop.
Two things  1. Even when you bought a hellcat you said you would destroy it and you didn't really destroy it  2. I don't get it you can buy 3 used Ferraris for $400,000 and destroy them over the course of 10 videos and increase the number of views at least 20 times
And you have money that’s nothing to you to buy that Ferrari do that go buy a Bugatti and do that to the Bugatti come on man you got millions of dollars now that’s nothing to you
All the people mad don't understand what a tax write off is.
fucking lost at the crutch .. lmao
No damage to the car so far
😂😂😂
bros playing irl gta with that Ferrari
And now he has a tax write off Ferrari F8
he really made it. congrats man been watching you since the jump and always loved your videos
3:13 lmao
Ferrari frothing at the mouth rn
*Sponsored by Ferrari*
I want your Rc cars  before you destroy them!😂😂
*LIKE IF YOU LOVE GOD
wd!!
This was actually just a balloon ad
The subtle nod to Forrest reviews and to Doug had me ROLLIN!! Cody nails it again!   Oh… and I laughed so hard at the end… I didn’t think it was ever going to end, brilliant!!!
The ending 😂
Bro, you didn't throw the kitchen sink at it. Try setting a Heilex on it.
Lamborghini is better
Waited so long for this video 📹
eyes : damn that's a destruction ears : thats heavenly !
(:
My channel name ump king 495
This was my favourite video
I only hate the fact that I can't do what you do, fucking legend. God damn you are my kinda people.
I think the bubble can support monster max
This hurt to watch.
Delete THIS.
The content not cutting it for me anymore.. all these videos are weak 3months apart give me break compared to the original WD where the cars/truck actually ment nothing to him where there was no script..everything he does is half assed now goes to show he's in it for the money not original just another copy cat of the system👎👎👎
He actually didnt destroy it. Ferrari is safe and sound. Kinda disappointed , but vid was fun to watch though
watch him earn a contract with ferrari to be in charge of the durability testing
GTA LIFE BABY!
Perfect ending to a GREAT starting!!!! Can’t wait for the next video.
😁😁😁😁😁😁
where are the cargo containers from? what brand?
Ferrari is definitely gonna blacklist Cody. And that's fucking awesome hahaha.   Keep up the good work
Cody is playing GTA V online in this video. He has the modded account with a lot of money a Turismo R and is cutting up the roads of Paleto Bay
I'm surprised he didn't do the excavator test on it yet.
This is so refreshing 😂
The only thing I care about in this video is knowing what kind of tarp this is.
When everything was being thrown at the Ferrari, I couldn’t stop laughing 😂
ferrari gunna go after the guy who sold it to you
That car doesn’t have the painted shield option btw those are the regular shields are Ferrari with painted shields don’t have a badge it’s just painted directly on
One of his best videos so far 👌🏻
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why
My fav YouTuber
Hennessy next??
Made me laugh thinking this is how i go in gta whit super cars Off-roading😂
If you buy a car it’s yours, you be your best you! Dealer made there money.
People on food stamps going to Italy, people working 80+ hour weeks and broke, then there’s this guy, life is crazy man
People in Africa could've eaten the Ferrari
This is thee funniest shit I have ever seen!!!! Bubble Ferrari!!
The plastic bag was incredibly surprisingly strong!  Loooool
that was genuinely disturbing. Next video, buy an Abrams tank, and enter an offroad race with it.
I finally understand. Cody is 100% a mid level borderlands boss. I can see him on pandora with his psycho fucksticks hootin and hollerin
This is awesome 😂
Quote of this video no need to get a truck for off roading just buy a ferrari
I want the end section on a loop 😂 i couldnt breath i was laughing so hard. Thanks cody!
Did you get sued though? 😅
That was entertaining, I always wanted a Ferrari. Maybe I will get me one in the future.
10/10
I bet he loves the hilux more 🤣
Oh wow 😮 😂
Bubble cover sales are about to go through the roof with Cody’s advertising skills
how could anyone dislike this pure awesomnes
This video shows what a spoilt retard you are lol
I’d still take that Ferrari 😍😂
Dude just made the car bubble company a commercial with a half a million dollar budget
Ferrari been real quiet since this video dropped 🤣
forza in real life fr fr
Me in Forza Horizon
I feel like you need to start giving away some cars MrBeast style. Make people destroy their cars not knowing you’re about to buy them the freshest of whips
Good video.... NOT AS GOOD AS TAXTHERICH VIDEO 😢
This gives me extreme anxiety😑😳
Greatest product review that company’s going to sitting in millions after that torture test😂😂😂😂😂
Dudes in China laughing in their best up 458 dudes will cross-country on MTN roads just to avoid the government
I drove through the fields around my dad's house when I was a kid in my expensive foreign sports car. Did I say expensive? Well, not too expensive, but it was a foreign car from Europe. Did I forget "sports" car,  yeah, not a sports car.  But, it was a foreign car. It was actually just a run down VW bug, but it was a lot of fun. Did most of what was done here. Best part, I didn't get sued by VW.
Oh the comment at who did the tuning for the car lmao. Mistaken my friend. That shops a joke, I worked there. They like to screw over their “best friends”
WE JUST WANNA see 6.0 PT2 thanks bye
Car
Lmfao.... the best part is when everything in the garage starts flying at the ferrari bubble >< lol im dyin

Don’t forget to update the VinWiki. 😂😂😂
Ferraris are for nerds.
What would be one car that's expensive that you'd buy to actually keep and baby ?
So Forza Horizon was accurate lol
I hate rich idiots.
I Wish I Could See The People’s Face’s At Ferrari When They See These Videos Especially The Future Ones 😂🤣.. Anyone Else Excited To See What Those Nazi’s Do Lmfao..
Bro saw Forza Horizon 5 and said “Bet” 😂☠️
this video made me want to buy one.
Really loved the part where you destroyed the car …..
I don't think peopel sould get sued for doing something with there own. its like me having 10 million dollers but I cant speen it
The Guy that every car company wants!😎😂
Nothing makes me want to open up my wallet more than a web page titled “Ferrari mulch”…
I dare you to tamper with the logo
As some poor Italian craftsman cry’s, I smile while watching this and retract my stolen valor comments this is great 😅
I'm excited, just like if the car was mine lmao
I always wonder who is going on GovPlanet and buying the "Lot of 48 Misc. Storage Boxes" but here you are haha
I was laughing so hard when they were throwing EVERYTHING at the Ferrari in its "protective bubble"
Where was the kitchen. Sink?
Amazing 😂
Would be better if it actually got destroyed
O yea I forgot you badass driver
This guy Cody has potential, he should have his own youtube channel someday
Why would you destroy this people out there who cant even afford to go tot eh doctor and your throwing 400k away like nothing.
This man represents freedom
Please tell me there’s gonna be a part two cuz ts still look brand new 😭
Man never fail to surprise but this one is the best almost shit myself good job man
Safe to say that the car condom works
Let me tell ya if I ever get a chance to buy a Ferrari I am going on national television the day I buy it and I'm taking my a ball bat to it first secondly I'm gonna pour a slight amount of diesel fuel on it and lighting it on fire and to finalize my purchase of said Ferrari I'm packing it full of tannerite and I'm giving it a full send with a barrowed 50 bmg because I bought a Ferrari and couldn't afford a 50bmg if that ain't enough I'm gonna sell it to a homeless man for 1 penny just to prove to Ferrari it's my fuckin car and I can do with it as I please hell I may end up scrapping that idea and just try to grow a Ferrari tree. We've all seen the jeep tree whistlin grew imma grow a Ferrari tree just to see Ferrari sue me
Not everyday you get to see a farrari get destroyed
Dude when all the crap got thrown on the car capsule I laughed so hard. These videos are pure gold.
Duhff
Can I have the Ferrari when your done with it please? I'll come pick it up. I've always dreamed of owning a Ferrari and I may be able to afford this one when you're done with it. Let me know. Thanks.
How many views does it take to pay for the car?
I know that road.

One of the best productions I have ever seen on this channel. Was thoroughly entertained throughout the video, but the end. Omg the end literally killed me, I was laughing increasingly harder ever second. Best outro ever on YouTube.
It looked fine part 2 is needed
smiles and grimaces
Cody you’re awesome! I bet all the rich guidos that spent their life savings for one of these things are crawling in their skin. It’s only $400K, basically a cheap house in Texas. Keep up the hard work and entertainment!!!
Track it at least once ?
Sick ass foo nice drifting
This is what happen when squatted trucks are too easy to pick on.
Bro you are #1 on trending
What are the political implications of this video?
He’s literally playing forza horizon lol

Bro got a whole arsenal stacked up against that wall.
So is anyone els just admiring the 2 story high stack of ammo lol
I was watching this post and then my neighbor came and we watched it together. He said this post really changed his life and it touched my heart. My village people are so grateful. Am proud to say cool post wow thanks for sharing...!!

American Bully meets his baby brother for the first time https://youtu.be/yuThujvVfMQ

Well it’s not his fault the car is red.
respectfully, I wonder if he has ANY remorse
Will this car will make it to the shredder? I'll definitely buy a few jars of Ferrari mulch! 🚘 Sign me up!
SO PAINFUL BUT SO FUN
He probably has a ton of YouTubers wanting to buy the car when he is done with it. 1.8 million views in 1 day and #1 trending that's crazy.
I just watched the video on tik tok had to see the full one it's alr top ten in my favorites alr 🤣
This is going to trigger all the materialistic dorks ✌️
When you play too much forza horizon :

Trending #1 wooooo
🤣🤣🤣
That was money well spent.
Where the hell he get a Ferrari from 😂
cease and decist letter otw
I think Cody should do a head to head competition with the new corvette vs his Ferrari
Anyone remember the wrench fight they had back then in the garage? 😂😂😂 as soon as I saw a wrench fly at the car bubble I lost it 😂😂
Literally drove it like he stole it in a video game 😂😂
#1 on trending let's fucking go
The bubble should sponsor you.  That’s a impressive bubble
The Ferrari F8 getting abused like that, she may be fucked up but at least she looks damn fine after
Material possessions = don't care😂  Gotta love the man
Rip Ferrari 😂😂😂
Threw everything but the kitchen sink at it
So how much does 1.8 million views pay? Enough to buy another Ferrari?
Wow 😂
I think you made the F8 market a  go little bit higher.
I’d proudly waddle down the road in a fucked up Ferrari with a huge whistlin diesel sticker on the back 🤣🤣

I’m genuinely impressed with how well the car bubble did 😂 not fully sure why you’d want something like that, but I guess they could be useful if you were storing a lot of cars in a building or something
after I read the title I was screaming ohhhh my gawwwwd 😅😂 awesome vid

Literally smiling the hole video
Making the world a better place just like Mr Beast. Well not really, not at all
All I can do is give you my support
He buying these super cars to actually use them and drive the fuck out of them. Soooo worth the investment in my eyes
I already love watching you guys every single day so by seeing Ferrari on Facebook and I know what they do to others I'm going to enjoy loving to watch this video.
Greatest ad ever for that car protector 😂
Ferrari are shitting themselves 🤣🤣
If there’s a genuine review this would be it !
I think your younger self would be real proud of you. Congrats brother
“Give me a hammer” 😂
I gotta say this one truly looked like a blast of fun excited to see were it goes hopefully it last a couple more videos🙄 God bless you guys 😇
😂
"That Ladder wasn't big enough either, give me a hammer." You will only ever hear those words in that order come out of Cody's mouth. 😂🤣🤣
As soon as I saw the key I came to the comments to find the rarri heads loose their snowflake shit
How I feel watching WhistlinDiesel!  https://youtu.be/YbBiXPVKuTA
Put paddles on. Go to galamis
The bubble reminds me of the old farm in Indiana when they had a wrench fight in the garage
This needs to be an ad for the company that makes that air bubble cover. I’m actually impressed.
I love Cody he makes content that no one else can hold a candle too, if you see this Cody keep it real 💯
This is going to piss off the Ferrari Lawyers, and I love it lol
comodo gaming mad a squated truck and said it looked hidious and called you out   he painted it the same teal as your first molch pile
bubble was actually kinda impressive
I was mostly impressed by that bubble
That's just really disgusting and childish. People like you don't deserve to drive Ferraris. Acting like an attention seeking clown for some views on youtube.
Hey now, leave Doug out of this! lol
Y’all I’m a valet and my boss owns this exact car…. I drive it weekly and this man just made my intrusive thoughts come to life I’m so happy
Gimmie a hammer 🤣
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Car balloon sales after this 📈
Any car guy is in pain
Ferrari : cease and desist order ASAP !!!!
#1 on Trending even after getting nuked for an hour LOL if that isn't proof that Cody is the king of car content idk what is
The rev limiter tho 😫
I bet the people who’s comments got used in the video geeked when they seen theirs 😂💯 not talking shit either, I’d probably laugh an be like that’s dope
Bro you for real the goat fuck Ferraris best car destroyed videos you made so far
Man’s playing forza horizon 5 irl🤣
This is great stuff lmao. I love the comedy you put into it. I was laughing my ass off as you guys literally threw the shop at a $400K car in a bubble. Keep it up Cody. One hell of a content creator!
Oh this is so Gonna get a Cease and Desist order, and I can’t wait for it to unfold 😂😂😂
Load
It needs a straight pipe
I think we can all agree that ferrari is run by fuckin retards suing people to do whatever they want with their own car, that they paid for with their own money. That's like an artist selling tickets at a venue and then asking everyone to return their tickets at the end of the show, like wtf is wrong with them?
I kinda want a bubble for my car now.
Will there be ferrari mulch?
When you gave a retard money and a YouTube channel this is what you get.
Raised 4wd is not necessary for off roading. My 77 Honda wagon could go places
we need a L5P durability test.
Yes
It hurt me so much to watch but I loved every minute of it.
Let me get it when your done ✅ +_+ …
Jeezus that's beautiful. How strong of a car is it tho. Could it survive the Toyota test
Sorry but I love the video u should joined DEE
Nobody is going to mention how great of a driver Cody is?
Bro is a Menance 😂
https://youtu.be/MjK3S_GgUig
I was hoping to see the air mag at the end like a Easter egg 🤣
Upchurch just wrote you a intro song for monster max about 20 minutes ago
You know how many homeless veterans you could have helped with $400,000 or how much help $400,000 would have done at a children's cancer research center or the Mayo clinic you have the means to make the world a better place but instead you would rather get views on YouTube in Tik-Tok that's just really sad
What all of us have done in Forza Cody is doing IRL… props to you man keep it up!
Is this the ferrari proving ground?
It's back!
Comment
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
Upchurch just put out a song called Monster Max part 1
Bro can you buy me one ? 😅
your generation never ceases to amaze- acid rain hitting all the states east of Mississippi and your blowing up basically money!   ignorance is sweet sweet bliss!!!
What's up with the creepy guy sporting the Pedo stash taking notes @ 4:40?
Watch this before Ferrari forces him to take it down!!
That had to be one of those 379 wrench tool set, they just kept coming, fkn hilarious
He’s gonna get sued
Did I just see a ‘60s corvette??
https://youtube.com/@daynelentertainment
I have always wanted to do this to a Ferrari. This was the best video I've seen all year. It made me feel all warm inside. #offroadeverything
I support this endeavor
curious what brand those storage bins are against the wall? thnx :)
That is like the hilux of cars.
7:40 Tax The Rich vibes…😊
The fact that I look forward to you posting man ! Keep it up ! Fuck the haters bro 💯🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 God bless you 💯💯💯💯
Been waiting on this amazing ness 💪🏾💪🏾
Must have watched StreetSpeed 717 video and him off roading a C-8, except he ran his through a pond and jumped it.
Meanwhile at Ferrari HQ…
3 minutes in and I love it.
That bubble company should use this as an ad freakin insane
Finally, I've been waiting for a video like this. This right here is quality whistlin diesel content
All the random shit thrown at that bubble!! 😂😂😂😂😂
Terradyne Gurkah LAPV torture test?
looks like forza in real life
14:03 I have never laughed 😂 so hard at a whistlindiesel video 😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 well done!!!!
My heart..
Forza Horizon IRL 😂😂
Literally forza irl
Literally forza irl
I’m so glad Cody isn’t sacred to call companies out on there bs
Me in forza belike
The bravest Ferrari in the world
9:23 “Quiet down! I’m trying to see where I’m going!” Lol This is interesting and funny at the same time Edited to add: I’ve watched it 3x now
Ferrari doesn’t even know how tough their cars are
Pls do a Koenigsegg next
Friggin love it, that’s so funny. He should’ve dressed up like Magnum PI.
A drunk driver pulled a hit and run on my 1973 dodge charger. Want to buy me a new one?
The bubble!!!😂
Enzo is smiling someone is enjoying his car.
Took you 3 weeks for this video? Come on now.
At first I was afraid now it's Picasso
Imagine wasting 400k because you can? Honestly I’m not watching anymore
🤞Seriously …..Cody don’t get killed in the Ferrari. We need you to keep giving the gift that keeps on giving🤘Priceless Entertainment 🙌
He should add a body kit
I'm not saying they can't but how can a company have any legal leverage over someone for doing whatever they please with their own property?
The ending was hilarious!! Epic video!
I need the link to that bubble that things got some durability 😂
Cody, I received a message from God. He says: "Keep showing the world,  I put you all here to love people and use things .....and not to love things and use people."
You would have got way more views if u would have just gave it to me 😂😂😂
❤️
It’s nice to see a good parking brake for monster max😂😂
Are those stock ground grippers? I'm actually impressed
osha 10:58
This one pained me to watch. With that said this is fantastic
This man never releases boring content, he always makes my day better if I'm having a shit day. Keep the awesome videos coming. 💪😈
Lean700 Lean700 Lean700  🤯🤯🤯
Ferrari is prolly finna sue him for this
Lol he went from an old cateye duramax to a brand new Ferrari keep up the work Cody
Forza Horizon Real Life Edition
Only whistlindiesel will have a general lee and will instead whip a Ferrari like it’s a general lee
You just have that company the greatest ad ever
you would be the person to destroy a million dollar car for sure good content tho
How you gonna flex all these cars but not have a blacktop driveway yet🤔
I died when Cody said "I need a hammer..." and then the most random fricking things just started getting chucked at the Ferrari in a plastic bubble!🤣😂😂
This man has 🏀 of steel
It’s like all of us in Forza but he’s in real life
The barrage of everyday in the garage was the best thing I’ve ever seen.
Ferrari approved testing grounds
funny thing is It's not even about the Ferrari, it's just him showing how much "fuck you" money he has
“Give me a hammer-“ throws everything at the Ferrari in the shop but the Hilux itself 😂😂😂 one of the best videos made to date by anyone
Forza In real life
Tax the whistlin diesel
What's the link for that bubble tho
I showed this to my coworkers, all of them said you have to be the biggest piece of shit in the country. An absolute dickhead. Good job! You’re still doin it!!! 🙏🙏🙏
Cars are useless, no clearance
How much for your “thicc fil a” patch I wanna buy it.
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.                                                  /.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,/. ,./ ,/. ,/.
when you gonna get a corvette
Gta6 just dropped and it's in VR
bro is playing forza irl💀
Ppl get upset about trucks but then love to see this....  what is wrong with you ppl😂
I died at the end when they just started throw the whole shop at the bubble 💀🤣
That was a good idea to spruce up the tread on the driveway first. Very impressive off-roading, did not expect that! They’re probably worried if you tear it apart that will expose proprietary elements idk. Thanks for making it happen buddy 👍
How I be in forza
Do a 3rd gen tacoma
Stolen Valor🤨
You need to get one of those AR-15 power washer attachments.  Spray and pray..
WHY?
I love how he throws random shit at it, crutch’s, school zone sign, lmao😂😂😂😂
im genuinely impressed
This is probably bad for me to say but how about you add monster wheels on the ferari
Ferrari is too scared to get close to your property 😂
Forza Horizon 6 looking pretty cool
TOTAL IT! YOU WONT NO BALLS! @whistlindiesel
like some shit i do in forza
Best one yet,  You should post a video of all the crybaby haters that see this😂😂🤙 🖕ferrari and they're douche bag owners
man that looks like a hell of a time smiles per gallon
This looks exactly how I drive super cars in Forza lmaoooooo. I love it
That was fun😅😅👍👍👍
Best Ferrari ad ever !
I think this whole video was just an Ad for this bubble thing
The car bubble company should 1,000,000% sponsor you and air this everywhere that was impressive.
I want to see him take the engine out of it and out it into something ridiculous.
Now that was satisfying .Thank you ..
Ready for it to die. ❤
Driving in Forza horizon be like
Watching you off-road that looks like everyone in gta 5 with their super cars xD
#1 Trending of all of YouTube after being demonetized and then demonetization reversed. You are basically controlling YouTube now. 💪💪💪
🫣🫣🫣
Test a humvee?
I thought you were test the durability of the Ferrari not the damn bubble
I bet that engine could run on olive oil…. It is Italian and olive oil seems Italian enough.. right? Anyways that car should run just fine with some olive oil 😁
looks lack a brick!
🫡🫡 🔥 🔥🔥🔥
Wanna bet the person that handled your sale is gonna face repercussions 🤣
Bro playing Forza Horizon in real life
im waiting for the "I got sued by Ferrari" video
This is too funny
Great progress man!
This reminds me of tax the rich.
my balls went cold watching this
What a perfect way to write this off for taxes 💯
I love this lol...... even super-duper rich billionaires are to scared to enjoy their car like this
Dudes playing Forza IRL
When he got out with army gear on I died
Tune file name uploaded = gold!  👏 👏 4:52
Dumb.
Okay 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Could have helped a lot of people with that money, f I and your daddy's money.
Fuc u all the way from Houston Texas
Average day in Forza Horizon 5.
Watching this video is like watching someone drive in GTA🤣
it's like playing GTA in real life 🤣
Cody be playin gta in real life
Taxtherich would be proud
Ya buddy...living my dream life. Keep it up. Me and my kid love your videos. Wish we could help you with all the haters...i tell my three kids you grew your own brand from nothing. Proud of you. I remember the first videos with doing the wide wheels on your work truck. Anyways. Keep it up. Kris.
So Forza Horizon IS a realistic game after all 🤔
This is the best entertainment I've seen in a while😆
"give me a hammer"... I'm crying.
Surprised they didn't throw a kitchen sink at the Ferrari bubble
Omg thank you 4 doing this.
Carolina squat and auto zone decorations please
Number 2 right now ha they just didn’t wanna pay you for
I’ll trade ya for a Mcchicken once you’re done with it
I’m just amazed how truly far Cody has come well done buddy!!
Dude, just wondering. Do you get off abusing farm animals too? I've heard that there is a definite correlation between the abuse of exotic supercars and the abuse of farm animals. Really check yourself in to the nearest hospital for observation before it's too late.
No one ever talks about how good of a driver he actually is😂
Ferrari needs to send you a check. This is the only Ferrari video i’ll ever watch.
Gave me Lancia 037 rally car vibes and I'm really about it.
Why's everybody peddling  his Nuts
Nobody talking about how that bubble is literally invincible
Currently #1 on trending Feb 20th. Let's goooo!
He must have fallen in love with it because he didn't destroy it 😝
Mf playing forza irl at this point 😂
The losi Baja Rey thrown at the Ferrari was golden
Who knew can am painted their new x3 red 😅
I never knew that car bubble was a thing, you just make that company so much richer.
You forgot the kitchen sink.
can you put a jet engine on the back
I probably will never be able to even sit in one of these
Dude, next time you should get in the bubble while we throw ladders and other shit at you.
All this proves is, EVERYTHING I do with my Ferrari in Forza it completely plausible. So, suck it, Geico Insurance Macon Georgia.   I don’t know why I choose them to take my juvenile aggression out on. However, everyone I knew that worked there absolutely loathed that place. 🤷🏻‍♂️ this was…. a decade ago? 🤔  🙄 ANYHOW, I can’t believe you have continued to read this. I drifted out writing the intro. Hell, the video has been over for almost, what… like five minutes ago. Plus, I just wasted time making sure I did not use and digits before I decided to spell five or use the symbol we recognize as five “5”  Admit, now I have to Google where we came up with the symbols we use…. Hold up young bull, I will tell you so you do have to waste the time you have been wasting here…….  Yooooo please tell me this is true. It seems to make sense. Hahahaha I love learning random stuff. I am guessing you do too.  https://prezi.com/12t1hwvczynm/how-did-numbers-get-their-shape/  Real rap, we should probably do more research to verify this before we tell EVERYONE on some stupid tictok… 🤦🏻‍♂️   But, if it did and this blows up, ya boy Mickey 23051 02:40z
Off roads better than I would of thought.
Hill climbing a Ferrari I can check that off the “never thought I would see but I’m not totally shocked” list😂
bro gonna get sponsored by that bubble company
That's it? There has got to be a part 2. LOL!
You need to take this to Glamis California with paddles! I think it will make a great dunning car!
Lmao. Dude you are absolutely nuts
Literally what I do in gta
He just in forza horizon
Solid content Cody🫡 you really stick out from the rest in the best way 🤘
I was waiting to see a dildo in that line up being thrown at the bubble 🤣🤣
I’ve watched this video Three times wtf
Bubble to protect it from helicopter crashes 😂 I love it
Playing Forza Horizon irl
Holy bonkers hilarious!!!!, that bubble did way better than expected...the key fob...shame on ferrit for not being a minx
I am really trying to show my kids, and many others. That anything is possible just have to put a little work into whatever it is you are doing, don't quit. I will be uploading prints, funny videos, etc. I would love if you hit the like button, maybe left a comment.. would be super stoked if you hit that subscribe button.. lol thank you for your support, and helping me show the kids, anything is possible of you put your mind to it.
Thank you Cody you made Forza Horizon realistic 😂
There might come a point where they just skip the lawsuits and send the mafia after you
This was not the first time I've been click baited
Hahaha I haven’t laughed that hard in awhile.  Thanks
Am more impressed with the bubble
Please please please at some point in time hit it with a Ford just to add insult to injury
That end part was way too satisfying congrats on another successful start to vicious durability test 👍
Burn the world and smile as it turns to cinders.. congrats f<ck Ferrari.
This guy is playing Forza Horizon in real life.
That bubble thing got just got the best ad they could every dream of!
The definition of forza horizon in real life, I cannot wait for cody to get a McLaren! 🤣🤣
@taxtherich 100
You know kids in Africa would destroy you for that Ferrari
Lmaooo my face hurts from lol so much 👏🏽
Nobody at Ferrari has had the balls to watch this video.
The red gas can flying over the top of the cover had me laughing the most.   😆
I’m crying right now
😭😭
Diesel driving out of bounds Irl.
Fuckinnnnn legend
Can you guys do a test on Mercury 250 pro xs 4 stroke outboard? Want to know how much they can take. All I see is cars and shoes, what about boats?!
😂😂😂😂
Does anyone else notice 50 military cases along the wall in the shop? 😅
The bubble bit with the broom killed me XD
What the heck is in the wall of crates?
You should see if you can run it wide open and try skipping a pond with it that would be so cool
Ferrari Bureau of Investigation 5:46
From the bottom of my heart, thankyou!
RIP to the person who had to clean that up😂😂😂
bro literally j playing Forza in real life
Bro threw ace hardware at it
the spy balloon joke at 11:40 i was eating ramen noodle and i just fucking spit it everywhere on my keyboard, that shit was halarious.
13:14 was the funnest part 😁 great commercial advertising for the bubble thing
That bubble is actually impressive
What the f Brun
Can i have it after your done???
Zero fucks given. What a GUY!
I wish I was as successful as u to do the things u do but keep going ur doing great👍👏
For the last 3 years, I’ve been trying to make money online. $0 till now. But if could click this link and accept my invitation, you’re going to make me the happiest person in the world. Please click the link and help me to get $100 and do for yourselves as well. Love for all you
Amazing
The bubble protector company better use this for advertising
The edits kill me 🤣
Forza Horizon mode
I don’t understand why people support literally destroying these cars. Reducing the pool of cars that exist is not a good thing.
😂😂😂😂😂
This brings me back to wrench fight days
Great video buddy 👏👍
That could be an ad for the car bubble
Whistlin is NOT a self indulgent weiner with too much bloody money, he is a connoisseur
dude i didn't know ferrari made a rally car that's sweet
I was cringing every time he did something bad to the Ferrari
You better hope Fridays and see these videos man I’m Tony
Crazy to watch from the old chrome duramax, to a freaking Ferrari😂
If Ferrari made a rally car would it look like that?
not for nothing, but that car bubble is bad ass.  this was the perfect commercial for that product
you should remote start it in the bubble
One day ill be here with this channel of mine. But instead it will be full of antityranny and gun testing. I swear if I get enough subscribers I'll buy a mini gun and destroy it lol
literally my first whistlindiesel video and holy fuck i have never subscribed to a channel faster in my life
I love your videos
If nothing else he made a hell of a commercial for that bubble
hahahhaa awesome !!!!
This is the best video of 2023!
This made me want a Ferrari even more
"They should have never gave y'all NgRS money" ~Dave Chappelle~
YOUR A IDIOT
🤸‍♀️😩
This is why they call them SUPER cars. They stand up to everything
13:17 How to Basic moment
weird ngl
This is awesome best video in a while
@taxtherich
6:00 Captain maniac on the Road hahaha Blow this motor and 📽
This turned into a inflatable commercial
I laughed several times!  The roof caving in 😂.
Might be one of the best videos I’ve ever watched. Lol. Good shit
Nice bro
Keep doing gods work WD!
Forza horizon 6
He looking real Hollywood lately 😂😂
lol
ill give you 1000$ for that ferrari as is
HavEn't started to watch....BUT.....I LOVE IT.....SMASH THAT SH#@!!!!!!!!!! ☝😆🤙💯
Buds playin horizon irl 💀💀💀
forza horizon irl
Hey, at least your having fun destroying it..   An F' Ferrari if I pay $400k for something I can do whatever I want with it.
hes really out here just living my forza life
Forza horizon 5 but real life
YouTube content prostitution for views is the new normal.
Hey whistindiesel. I have an old truck in Stuttgart Arkansas. It was my first truck. It was a graduation gift. It was be awesome if I could see it on your videos. If you can please email me.
Its painful to watch but i cant stop 🥲
Wow your videos used to be the first in my feed.  Now I find em days later.  Must be the lack of activity.  Not complaining tho…best content on the tubes.  🤙🏻🤙🏻
Dude, the China spy balloon part had me rolling 😂. Mad respect as always!!
WD is like Mr.Beast in the fact that they are both rich and people hate on them when they spend their money.
i lost it when they started throwing random shit to it lmao
WhasleinDiasael!!!!!
Hands down the best YouTuber out there
that ending...we can call it the safety bubble test. Had me in tears rolling laughing. Fantastic video!
Try saveing some of that cash man for hard times
That car bag company owes you millions
The amount of objects thrown at that bubble tho😧
Can't wait to see how the bubble holds up to raining helicopters in the shop.
Have you been sued yet
Golly you threw everything but the kitchen sink at it 😒
This is literally forza in real life 😂
Mans will never see daylight again after Ferrari sees this
I love that he does things nobody else would do to a expensive car
he's using it exactly as Forza Horizon intended
Badass
You should give me the car after your done with it 😂 😅
This is what everybody wants to do with a super car but we just can’t afford it
This is bonkers!
4:18 and Cali
why not buy a 100k car and give 300k to children and families in need of food and clothes?
Most definitely laughed way to hard at the end. That was priceless.
Proof that GTAV isn't lying about exotic cars being the best off-roaders.
Idk why people gets mad or the company he literally bought it in full. He doesn’t own any payments it’s officially his. If they throw a lawsuit he could win because it’s his car already and he doesn’t own anything to anyone
You Just Brought Forza to Life! #ThankYou
Fuck yeah, kill that thing!
Is this a commercial for the tent lol
need off-road 🛞! It’s draft able all nice
☠️🤣🤣🤣that was the best air bubble car tent commercial I've ever seen!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
How to basic ending>
One of the best videos I ever saw, new favorite video
You forgot to throw the kitchen sink😂
Bros playing forza horizon irl
Awesome video do u think the bubble could really stop a helicopter tho. You should test it 😂
That was Awesome
BRAVO!
im surprisngly all for this. the whole attitude towards ferrari the whole vid is on point.
😊
Honestly I just can't wait until he takes it out on the weekend after messing around with it making it all muddy scratched up grass in the wheels twigs in the scoop for like a dinner date.
Whoever made that bubble need this for their commercials
Reminds me of taxtherich
As a forza horizon player I see nothing wrong with this video
After a longggg longgg time, after yt channel taxtherich100 we have some one try to push purrari 🐎🐴🐴
Doin’ the lords work
Omg, had me dying at " protects from helicopter crashes"! Missed your videos man, but it was worth the wait!
@Ferrari
This is fantastic
Okay this is for you suck Ferrari in in the guys the jumping do the car and make it up grinding
This is gonna be way better then streetspeeds corvette jump 😂
F this car manufacturer
Hay WhistlinDiesel can you do a toucher test on a 2004 Cadillac CTS or any Cadillac? I would love to see a video on it.
And who says Ferraris aren’t practical 😂
Man I F’ing love your content. This was like my Forza horizon gameplay. Keep it up.
thats a lambo...
Me when I play Forza
#1 on trending! Way to go!
If they did the same thing with a New Range Rover Sport or Bronco, it would most likely be on its way back to the dealer in "Not Running Condition"!  Ferrari makes one hell of an "Off Road Runner"!
If you all remember him saying red equals dead, it means he's gonna destroy every red vehicle he's bought so far all at once in one video. Can't wait for that one.
Ill buy it off you dont worry ! 🏄🏽‍♂️🏄🏽‍♂️👀
Whoever sold you this Ferrari is probably fired…lmao
Take it to a Demolition Derby
Chevy colorado durability test
This may be the best thing I’ve ever seen.
This is the best way i've seen a ferrari used in my life
What happened to the hellcat ?
I’m laughing so much haha!!! But i don’t know if it’s because people find that car so delicate or because it’s just crazy your driving it like the duke boys lol! I love your crazy shit makes me think of my wild days/night lol!
Lamp this dude is a fucking legend. 😂
Why don't you help me get home
I would love to have that bubble for pollen season in Virginia
The white spy balloon joke 😂
MiniMax won’t last long.
This is what success looks like gents 😂😂😂
Hilux 😍
Destroying a G wagon was cool,   not a ferrari ,take it to the limit 250 mph that would be fun put a nos in it.make it a rocket launch.
This is so amazing
Mans is just #1 trending on YouTube, opens the video by slandering one of the biggest exotic car companies 😂
Number 1 on trending after being taken down 😂😂😂
Put it in a demolition derby
This needs to be put on the wagon wheels like the hellcat
You forgot the kitchen sink at the end
Ok try the Bugatti Chiron ☝🏽🤷🏻‍♂️😆
Wow can't wait for the lawsuit
Lmao I'm surprised they haven't tried to sue you yet
Wow whistlin diesel is on trendin #1
That bubble company is going to pay so much for that clip
I work at Ferrari. You're being sued as I type.
Literally playing forza horizon in real life
Ferrari Engine swap with Hilux???
He definitely devalues a car to make me not want to buy one. LoL
That's durable
Y’all must be rich cuz this is hard for me to watch smh suck a beautiful car and he is punishing the hell out of that pony
How much shit they got the whole hardware store?
That bubble car cover thing is actually genius.  You should start the Ferrari inside it and just let it idle till something happens.
This is bullshit man. Throwing that damn RC truck around with no care for it at all 😢
cant wait to see the off road ferrari build
Dde’s next project car 😂
Do a 79 land cruiser durability test, it's the upgrade of a Hilux
No one  ever mentions Cody's MAD skills as a driver.. Props brotha... I think you need to get Ford GT 500 and do your own Ford Vs Ferrari! Let's do this!!!
"As we get into these higher end vehicles"
this is how my dad would treat this car lol
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I was watching this and I looked down at my chest and had my hand on my heart and didn’t even know it, bruh I was stressing out.
Honestly this is just an add for the car bubble.
Shoulda did it with a F40, really make people mad
😮😮😮😮😮
the bubble people could use part of this as a pretty good add
Yea you don't deserve a Ferrari anyway, this is painful to watch before you even drive it
99% of you will never be able to afford this and that makes you mad you enjoy the destruction of the same very thing you will never be able to own . Sad fucking world . Full of parasites
fantastic
I'm pretty sure it's a rental
i wanna whoop his ass just for thinking about destroying thar car. video ended
I bet Tyler Hoover would still buy it.
So fkin awesome I literally hate Ferrari when you are done with your series run it over with monster max and put it out of its misery by filling the cab with tanerite and vaporize it remember to mess with the emblems
Best video to date
Ferrari should be honored. This just made me want one.
And you didn’t even throw the kitchen sink at it smh
Dude the ending killed me🤣🤣☠
OMG! Thank you, air bubble, for preserving this beautiful car! I was cringing the last minute of bombardment
This is so bad ass 😂😂
Mental problems with this guy
Crazy how they sue you for your car, it's like it's not even your car and you're just borrowing it
This is the only one that has hurt me. That’s my dream 😢
Put some of them off-road rubber bands on the back wheels
Damn I have post notifications on and it never notified me . I look for your video in my subs . Don’t find it . Once I look up your name then it comes up .
forza in real life damn near
Ferrari about to have a Rally team
This has been the greatest ad for that dumb bubble thing, I'm so impressed actually lol
the disrespect to ferrari is gonna be 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nice next Nissan patrol full boost
Durability test 1: Pass
Pay me 2000 for mine u can destroy it
Forza irl
Ngl.. that bubble tough af

This was a great video
All you have to do is replace the Ferrari badge with a lambo one lol, there’s your lawsuit.

You're living my Forza Horizon free play!

Back to your roots, I like it
i just realized this dude has a massive collection of cars on that back wall
You missed your chance.  Should of thrown a kitchen sink at it last.
He living the best life without giving a fuck
The ending was Hilarious and satisfying😆🤣😂
This should be listed under: Try not to say NOOOOOOOO!!! as best you can
I can not wait to see him f this car up
I love this man🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
If Ferrari is this much of a female over small stuff then why are they in business and selling their items if they're gonna do this to their customers thats such B S
number one on trending! thats awesome!
Boring... could've done worse.... I mean better.. haha.. I get its for the video.. but I'm sure you will really get sued if you go any further with "testing it".. sucks that Ferrari is that way.. but whatever
That yellow gas tank 😅😅 14:03
Cody out here getting ready for WW3. 😮
This is some taxtherich level stuff 🤣
Number 1 trending holy crap I seriously can’t wait for the next video on this Ferrari. You and your team are killing it!
Crazy is climbed that hill like that
I couldn’t stop laughing the whole video. This one was great man. The ending was probably the best 😂😂  I’m also super impressed with how well a Ferrari does off-road. Who would have thought 🤔
#1 on trending is crazy this is why whistlindiesel is the best fr
when u have ''too much money''
Brooooo your a savageeee
America is filled with Special people and special events. Somethings that come together and present to the world it's greatest challenges and welcome events and humore.
I think you single handedly just doubled the car bubble sales this year.
13:18 POV: you are a German tank commander in a tiger 2 during the western advance
beast
Buy a Yamaha banshee in the crate and watch half the world get angry..
Someone go back in time when he was putting tractor tires on his daily and show him a picture of his lambo r8 Ferrari and monster max
❤❤❤❤❤
They thought they could stop him.. na  bro got that dawg in him ain’t no stopping bro now 🐐🗿
He is doing the same things that we do in gta5, but in real life
You through everything at it, except the kitchen sink
Whistlindiesel and meatcanyon are the most hated on YouTube by YouTube 🤣🤣
Some ppl don't deserve having money
Man honestly the best thing I ever seen! Don’t comment on videos much but this one deserves it! Awesome content whistlindiesel ! Keep it comin
Im suprised he hasn't had his whole driveway paved yet🤷‍♂️

I was really hoping a kitchen sink would have been thrown so you could make the joke.
I help u bro pleaseeeessss
Just don’t call it a purrari but go ahead and wrap it in a cat theme
Nice Ferrari , don't scratch it 🫣
F**k Ferrari. See if it will survive a 1000 foot drop. Enter it into Cletus's burnout contests and wall tap every wall.
Lambo lover here, however, I've also raced a couple of Ferrari's. This hurts to watch, knowing how incredible these cars are. :(
Bruh this some forza horizon shit 💀💀💀
Man I like this guy
what a great car bubble commercial
Look at it this way…now we know what these machines can take..and tbh screw Ferrari and there nonsense rules…build cars to drive them
No one cares you stupid hillbilly
GTA IRL
Put it on 35's
*forza horizon gameplay*
This is a rare video that is absolutely perfect.
bro does not care if he gets sued. 🤣🤣
Lmao doug demuro 💀
Funny video
He's gotta destroy it before he gets the cease and desist
Man hahhahahaha this was funny af.
This is the GREATEST VIDEO EVER!!! Right Ferrari?
I really want to see him push this car to its limits like he did on the others
That was Murfreesboro rd near the Nashville airport
I had a Ferrari once…. But Ferrari sued me for dreaming about owning one. I no longer have a Ferrari
I made a comment over 2 years ago under this video asking for exactly this and for exactly this reason. WD came through.   https://youtu.be/ddAL6bKIktM
When you are going to blow it
You should just sent it into the bottomless mud pit
The man is the One man army of Mythbusters . #Boss
I love this dude 😂
Any og subscribers?
😂😂 love this Video
🙂
Did I see a MUFFIN TIN amongst the 388 items thrown at the Ferarri Bubble? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lol so you bought a ferrari to destroy it and didnt destroy it. So you bought a ferrari?
Damn u crazy, u love those crew cab Toyotas
So what your saying is that those badges are easy to rove and resell
Hammer time was epic. 🤣🤣🤣
this is cool i just feel bad for the haters
Is this Forza horizon 4
Real life forza horizon

Ferrari should sponsor you
13:15 I'm fucking dying. Best cip on YouTube ever
Damn awesome ad for Ferrari 🤣
Not saying u owe me anything but I would like to help drive cool stuff n break it n make jokes about touchy subjects n scare Jake there
95% of Ferrari owners are sick to their stomach right now lol
That’s where the muffin pan went! 😂
Seriously they are coming for something. Lmao.
WHAT A WAST OF MONEY(no hate plz)
People on Instagram are raging about him wearing the uniform you can buy the shit at a store like come on people I mean see where people coming from but it ain't stolen valor stolen valor would be wearing badges and rankings and there was none
This brings me so much joy I will cherish this video for eternity I can now die happy knowing this video exists thank you Cody ❤️
I’ve been saying it for years. This guy is Sid from Toy Story only he grew up and started playing with cars instead.
Can that one go under water??
Don't you have another channel where you flaunt the money you waste? You are gross. Get a life.
Ferrari is waiting for some feedback on the testing
I am 61 yr  old. Although I laughed , I think you are a little bit of an ass for the stuff you destroy.  What do you have You take care of and don't break ?   I have a good idea  - what if I let you Fix Up and repair a 1970 Mustang I have that has great sentimental  value to me  and give it back.  and it looks like a car I saw you damage. You can back it in to a Bulldozer to remove the back. It does not have to be perfect, I just want it to run and not be dangerous - it will take a Antique license so i dont think it has to be inspected.  I think it needs a back clip.  If You did this for me  I would think You are real cool. The Truck in the Ocean was the best.
Yeah well there's a snake in my pants that needs to be handled by someone other than me and not an ugly old lady or a dude in a ugly old lady costume or some other personality in the same ugly cracked out Mrs doubtfire costume
You're a piece of shit for ruining something that somebody poured their heart and soul into making.  Get canceled. Get deleted. Get fucked you fucking loser.
I saw you on Nashville driving it last week!
Watch, Ferraris going to approach you with their off-road vehicle for you to beat the snot out of. Mark my words
Strength Test:  Use the excavator and pick it up by the tow hook.
Quick! Find the difference in the video! xD
He’s going to be doing a Bugatti next?! 😂😭 Saddening, but fantastic video! Lmao!!
You should fill the balloon up with concrete then use the leaf blower to make sure it mixes all around inside the balloon with the Ferrari inside and then drive it through the rain😊
SIMPLY THIS BRO IS PLAYING FORZA HORIZON IN REAL LIFE!
You should just give me the Ferrari so I can destroy it
and doesn't destroy the ferrari...youtubers
Check out my new “how to make a McDonald’s shamrock ☘️ McFlurry” and subscribe!!
Number one on trending
Merica
Drive it with the excavator like the gtr next 😂
Real question how tf does bro manage to buy these stupidly expensive cars and absolutely destroy them? 😭
You gotta say the rev limiter on that car sounds wicked
Dudes playing gta lmao
Love oldschool
Impressive car and balloon. You chose well.
#1 on trending whistling!!!!!!?!?!?!. So glad to see bro!!!!!
Look whistlin, I’m just tryna work at McDonald’s and buy a 2,000$ car. My man bought a car 200 times the price and says imma destroy it.😭
One thing I do not understand is, if people truly care about their products and they are as good / durable as they say they should have Cody test them. For example the car bubble.
does he have enough ammunitions to fund a third world coup back there?
Ferrari now sells off road vehicles 😂. Badass car
Bro drove that F8 Tributo like TaxTheRich drove their 288 GTO.😂
This is the equivalent to playing forza in real life
my moms bag 13:26
Why 😢😢 give it to me I need a car please
I loved every min of this video
Real life forza
I'd jump off the top of those boxes onto the bubble....fly me in
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 this is epic especially the harder scene 😂😂😂
remind me if ever i make some kind of product that needs to be durable to send it to you for testing that bubble is obviously really well made...
Me in forza:
He done i it now Ferrari already filed the lawsuit
Its like Forza in real life
The video we didn’t know we needed
Ouch... Lambo cover on a Ferrari!!!  hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Its honestly a really good beater with sum tire changes.
I'm thinking you don't like red cars...🤯🙈🙉🙊💩😭 I'm glad you test drive these cars to see the reliability you need to see if it can jump that skid plate will come in handy do you have a place for the haters tears LOL you're the best keep up the test
dude if that bubble company dont want to use the ending of this video for their durability testing ads they are stupid. You can throw a tool box at your car in our bubbles and not one hit!
Hey!! That’s a lambo cover on a Ferrari?
nice job with 1# trending
Haha hell yes! Still good content gang, the car will probabky be repoed by ferrari before the next video can be released lil
I was not expecting what was about to happen at 13:20
My man’s is just so happy to Be alive, first it was destroying cheap cars for fun and now he gets to do it hat no one else will, destroy good cars and do it in the most fun and entertaining way possible
Its honestly just not enjoyable watching you destroy expensive shit just cuz you can anymore.  Maybe one day you will grow up.
Bro was ripping down Harding like people don’t already not care enough there 💀
Dudes really livin life like it’s gta
Think you're a piece of shit bro you'd be nothing without this YouTube all you be doing would be shoveling shit on your grandpa's farm
Lmfao at the end
#1 trending on YouTube! Congrats Cody!!!!! And that bubble tho!!
i think if doug watches this video he would of had a heart attack lol
Ok… but will the bubble stop a bullet?
Idiot
With a Lamborghini cover 😊😊😊😂😂😂
Lift it.  Please.
This guy is nuts 🤔
I can see why Ferrari might not like this video but I found the review very helpful. Love the car but not sure the brand is worth investing in. I can’t afford it anyway but still…
Idiots gosh lol
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The bubble and gigantic wall of cases was awesome
The rolls in the back the Bentley
This video could not stop making me laugh
It would be great to be this fucking wealthy
Whistlin Diesel is basically just a more expensive how to basic.
I bloody love it, Ferrari is going to be pissed 🤣🤣🤣🤣.
wished I had enough money to buy something, then destroy it for fun. def jealous.  maybe one day we will get there.....maybe not "buy a half-million car and destroy it for fun" but maybe somewhere where i'm not stressin out over money all the time
Me in Forza Horizon 5
This man can drive really good 🤣
Ill buy your Ferrari for $1 dollhair
In all honesty I’ve been having the roughest week haven’t smiled once i popped this video on and been smiling the whole video I absolutely love this no fcks given 😂😂😂  Edit: your editor is absolutely hilarious
Should make one lifted Awd
this is awesome
Some real life gta5 😆🥶
I have been waiting years of watching this channel for him to destroy a super car. I am a little late, but I am so excited.
lol he looks like Volodymyr Zelenskyy
You're a legend.
This is quality entertainment
“What’s wrong with her now?”
Me in Forza 4
u'll get banned
He’s doing what everyone does in video games but in real life. This is amazing
From bolting spacers spacers on an old white duramax  working construction to having what Joe Rogan calls "fuck you money" and being able to live everyone's dream of doing whatever you want when you want. I'd classify that as making it. Congratulations Cody
This was a great video!!
I love this kids videos give it hell WD
that poor UDR
This channel is the absolute best! Stay classy !
this man can drive his ass off
The finale was better than any firework show
When the Forza Horizon 4 music kicks in:
The real question is who’s on pick up duty ? 😂
that ballon thing was an epic idea. you all are brilliant
Lol the bubble u need one for everything  wonder if they come in monstermax size
Bro is playin Forza IRL 🤣🤣🤣
Why is this forza.?? 😂😂😂
Need for speed in real life lol
7:22 *gets the new car in gta 5 *
Me playing forza horizon lol😂😂
That's a funny-looking Hi-Lux...
This is awesome!!!
Guys out here playing forza horizon irl
All that shit being tossed at the bubble reminded me of that wrench fight video in your old garage, that shit was so funny
13:30 that is a testament to that bubble’s durability
Ferrari can get fcked, even if I could afford a mirror off of one I wouldn't buy one
use me as Dislike Button
😂😂😂😂😂
Hey Cody, are you still buying trucks to “test” them out?
GTA 5 physics
This is the BEST video you've had in a while.
pretty sure you broke the transmission with those codes lol
This was another unexpected and impressive video, thank you Cody for making me smile 😃
Homie playing forza irl 💀
Brooo just made the best Ad for the bubble company😂

That duck is insane 👌

How many ladders do y'all have? 😂
Cried laughing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Me when I play gta
Hilux!??
Gotta watch before the Ferrari calls YouTube to have this taken down
Damn I gotta get me one of those car bubbles. That was down right impressive!
You're literally the type of guy that buys 10 brand new Ferrari's to use as stunt cars when filming a movie.
I’m so glad someone does this shit lmfaoooo🫡
Great content fr
like the way you can drift
Forza horizon style
This is all editing
Desktop games is all i could think about lmao thats amazing
Here for the algorithm.  Go macedonia
I've never been bothered by one of your videos. This one stung a little 🤣 but the hell with that company
I guess gta was right you can just redline exotic cars up a mountain
You evil genius I love it keep up the good work🤟🏻
best advertisement plug ever for whoever sells the bubble
Cuando ferreira vea esto....lo betara
I'm just here for the algorithm boost
The old utubes blocked me from seeing this. Wasn’t in my sub feed.
He should throw wheel spacers and some sand tires on that bad boi just to take it to the dunes where the locals hate him lmao.
Man 8:10 to 8:35 that sounded fantastic 😍
I seen this on Instagram
That car bubble is impressive
Mark McCann watching this: Hehehe that's my illegitimate American boy... Don't tell Jayne!!!
The object throwing sequence had me laughing so hard. That was genius.
I got a nice high off watching this!
Grand Theft Auto 5 or Forza Horizon 5?
U didn't throw the kitchen sink
Is it just me or did this video get taken down for a bit?
Well done sir. Well done. I salute you.
Cody you are one crazy mofo 😂😂😂😂 I love it!I would love to see the face of the CEO of Ferrari right now!
the last part just fucking ended me bro i actually love you
I will say I love the way Ferraris shreek
You thought the R**ket L**ncher got you in trouble?....  You're really in for it now bub!
Es el mejor hace lo que nadie se atrevería a hacer un saludo desde Panamá  Por cierto me parece que el protector es buenísimo
This is the greatest Ferrari commercial in history
Bro is playing Forza
Is it faster than the general lee?
This is awesome. I bet car capsule will ask to use this to promote how durable their products are.
At this point this channel should change its name to, The bully guy.
Feels like Forza 5 but in real life 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
lmao, cant wait to see the reaction of Ferrari after this. Ending was hilarious
Bro it’s ur money burn it how u want !
That bubble thing is actually pretty impressive. Took some serious beating!
Next car "FORD GT" 🤪
When he threw the ladder 👻
Forza horizon 5 In Real Life lol 😆 😂 🤣
I just wanna know if the face shield got in the way driving that thing at all! Seems like it would’ve hit the headliner
LMAO!!!    I couldn't stop looking at all the cool cases behind it!!!     Can I have one of those?    lol     Thanks for the laughs!!
Cara que vontade de chorar
Had to go to his channel page to show the new vid since it didn't pop up on my home page even tho I'm subbed hmm
Shit give that money to me if you're going to waste it bro
The things bouncing off of it at the end is hilarious!!! Who wouldn’t known they built in a flippin drain in the hood 🤯
Fucking lost it when he said give me a hammer😂😂😂😂😂
Forza in real life
Whole time i was watching this I couldn’t believe it was actually happening. I believe hes doing it bc hes like that but sheesh
The end 😂
He must like this car because he didn't "destroy" it like he does most of them lol
I would pay anything to see a live view of Ferraris legal team watching this
Ferrari's good at off-roading confirmed
Ok now its back up which bit was removed?
Wow!  Love how it maintained traction up that hill!!!! AND sounded epic doing it
Gta vibes
my guy really went and forza horizoned that car!!
The bubble shield should be the real sponsor
legitimately impressed by that balloon
Clickbait No.1
Please buy the new Porsche 911 Dakar
The new Forza Horizon update looks amazing!
Has Ferrari entered the chat?!
God that building is really coming together... what a setup!
He’s gonna do what he does destroy it theh detail her up like he did the lambo
Come to Portugal bro!

bro thinks he's playing forza
buggati now ferrari \
give me plastic buckets.. give me empty gas cans Give me a ladder not thrown directly but with care to land flat.. where's the throwing  knife??? where's the throwing star??? where's the throwing hatchet???? disappointed this dude  typically  destroys ads this time he just made one for blunt items...
More fun than SNL or Colbert combined.
You can see the pitting on the glass from the sparks.
Seriously impressed with the car bubble
Whelp that’s it!.. @whistlindiesel is the best YouTuber! imo 😉
Good old tax the rich vibes.❤❤❤
I didn’t know Ferrari made rally cars
sick vid
Fuckin dumb ass. This kid has his priorities fucked up. I will officially say this kid has no appreciation for life. Help some people out! You ever think about what that kind of money could do to help some folks out.
13:20 bro this clip just needs to be a meme
3:18 This ...
Ferrari gonna ban this guy fast from owning their cars.
Even though im a huge fan of Cody, still it pains me to see the horrors hes doing to that car
THIS IS AN ART
Your channel sucks.
Living every man’s dream! Would love to rally a Ferrari 😂
Threw everything at it but the kitchen sink 😂😂
I know this is done for views so then you make more money. Its too bad you waist money rather then donating the money you just waisted on something stupid.
The driving skills down the driveway was insanely impressive
This is amazing
This guy is a total waste--needs someone else to at least be funny???
Lets try something else....gimmy a hammer..... Im dead.....
I love it
Yea just here to comment, you might be rich, but you fucked up.
Jeez, WD has really arrived.
"Everything but the kitchen sink." I was really hoping one would be thrown at it.
this reminds me of Forza
7:43 literally forza horizon
Its amazing that some people have enough money to buy a ferrari and try to destroy it
This would be me if I won the power ball.
Fucking hell yeah! What top gear!? Fuck them, the past is complete nobody. This fucking psycho is the king of car testing. A real brainless and overgrown like a monkey. Redneck to the second. A living legend ladies and gentlemen.
What a waste of money if it ain't American it ain't worth it 💪 yeah baby yea
This is the first time I’ve came across your channel. WHAT THE FUCK!!!😂😂😂love it👍🏼
In the outro I was just waiting for someone to through a baby😂
finally someone to do this ive literally been waiting the laws they have are absolute bs
Now we know all the road accidents with Ferrari's ain't the cars fault. That thing handled off-road like a champ
He’s playing Forza horizon in real life.
Fantastic!!!    Next level has to be CATERPILLAR mining truck durability test
Him: drives Ferrari on dirt  Ferrari: crying in the corner
thank you for this cody. the ending especially
First trucks name cars love this man’s he give no f
Personally when u ready u can send the Ferrari to South Africa For me we can test it on our roads here 😂🔥yours faithfully Trevan 😂❤️🙏
Have fun paying 300k dollars from Ferrari

I was enjoying this until he disrespected the R8 😆
super hard to watch but i enjoyed watching it
False advertisement

Not hating I love ur videos think there funny but I could use some of these vehicles for a daily or someone that doesn't have a car
Ferrari rally car
Ferrari nunca más t ara llegar ni de segunda o tercera mano un coche así estas humillando desprestigiando ala maraca FERRARI🐎
Every time I watch you I laugh like crazy 🤣🤣🤣
mfs in forza b like
bro is litterally my bus driver
How TF Can any company tell you what  to do , or not do for that matter ,  with YOUR personal property , that you paid in full for? They can suck a d***. Legal team or not it can't actually be legal for them to do that sounds like strong-arming to me . Tear it the f*** up WD!!!!! Fk em!
damn everything but the kitchen sink was thrown at it LMAO even Whistin Diesel cant break it
can i have a car? next video: buying that subscriber who asked for a car , a car :) pleaseeeeee whistlin diesel
My enemies Attacked me with Identified 1/2 American M-67 hand grenades... Do you think my enemies has American connection?
Coolest video I've seen in ages.. Ya lucky  bastard ..
Dude needs a crazy cinamanic video of the destruction of these cars beside the vlog format he has
I must admit, nothing makes me more happy than watching Whistlin diesel destroy some expensive shit. His maniacal smile makes you feel like you are getting to destroy it with him. Thank you for the awesome content
This is amazing! I wish he would have stopped at the bottom of the hill and floored the thing to see how fast he coulda got the wheels spinning while going 4 miles an hour 🤣🤣🤣
This video made my day it was crappy until now.
All you need now is a baby on board sticker and I think it would be complete.
Your videos never cease to amaze me and have me pissing myself the whole way through 😂 it actually held up so well through all of it
But seriously, your new channel banner is sick!
Awww I wanted him to blow it up
1.5 million views.. this guy is a G.
Damn dude. #1 on trending. Good shit
i LOVE you for making this video…
Fucking aye this shit makes me happy 😃🤣 Ferrari is so snobby. The fact they won’t just let anybody buy a car, they deserve this shit 100%
This genuinely hurts me seeing this work of art being destroyed
I’d love to have such a historical piece of history can I buy it from you bro?😂
clickbait... not destroyed  ran when he parked it
This is like real life Forza.
#1 on trending bro 🤑🤑

Wish you wore your Dior work boots for this stuff.
I think you need a bigger ladder  Like the mud Princess 😅
13:18 is that a jui jitsu karate muay thai move?
Drive it through the bottomless mud pit
To the person reading this: Don't give up. You are on this earth for a reason! God has huge plans for you! Google Jeremiah 29:11 or look it up in a Bible :) You are loved!
OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK. STOP! Who's the JOKER that threw the RC car @13:31? WE NEED LIMITS MAN!!!! Oh wait, it's fine, it can take the abuse. RC cars are tough!
When he took the cover off I swore it was a lambo😂 how unoriginal can the company get, they all look the fckn same🤷‍♂️
So hard to watch but keep up the good shit 👍👍

Here to watch for the 2nd time.😊  For good measure
gotta say that bubble works pretty good, Repels basicly everything you could throw att it in a shop :P lol
I'm ready to find a new planet to live on now
Doing gods work
I didn’t overheat I’m really impressed 😂 The end had me rolling on the floor 💀

You forgot to throw the kitchen sink at it! 😆
I love the fact that that car bubble is actually pretty functional

Click bait 👎
creating more accounts to subscribe to get him closer to 10mil

WhistlinDiesel just delivered a big F you and your lawsuits to Ferrari's face, god I love this channel.
Ohh yeah

Impressive video 🤢
His slowly getting so much money it's starting to become frightening
FUKN LEGEND BRO
I love that you covered it with the Lamborghini cover!!!! That’ll get em fired up really quick.
I fully expected that bubble cover to pop genuinely surprised by it
Ferrari + Bubble Durability test *
Probably the most fun anyone has ever had in a Ferrari

"Mom, can we get forza?" Forza at home;

This was a hard one to watch 😂
Been wanting to watch a video of a super car doing shit like this for a long time
I think that ferari should give you a reward 😉

2yrs trying to build my Florida house that went from 299K to 380K and being ripped off by the builder 30K ...I can't help but think watching this 400K Ferrari is the equvilent of the home I have been trying to build since 2020. BUT I still love seeing this. It is such a breath of fresh from watching all of these people talk about the vin# matching and previous owners and history and receipts and oem parts this. OMG, I love it!
Good thing whistlin diesel already has valuable experience with the law
The car handled that stuff pretty nice I gotta say. I know this isn’t the end of that car but even what was thrown at it cheaper cars would probably not hold up as well.
Bugatti pls
Well that seems wasteful..there is a billion other people and communities etc that could of used it that are in dire need. But for views and Likes and attention you do this....bravo to this bullcrap propaganda
He ain't get the 4x4 one?
Cody gets to play GTA5 in real life. This is so awesome. 😂👏🏽👏🏽
Fly me over from Northern Ireland and we can both wreck it :}{
I mean he drove it and washed it 🤷🏻‍♂️, nice colour tho 👀💀
No drone just 15 camera men
Best youtuber ever 😅👏
Bugatti is probably sweating seeing what you're doing to a 400k Ferarri without fear
this is what these should b used for
I’ll take it after your done
If it’s red it’s dead😮‍💨
Imagine using your Ferrari too run from bulls 🤣🤣 they won’t sue you they would kill you

The perfect beater

This is hurting my feelings😂
Did I moss something?  What are all those cases in the back grounnd?
Your a fuckin idiot dude why ruin a beautiful piece of machinery a company proudly built to completely ruin it for views you don't deserve anything nice and people that entertain your stupidity are idiots too. Your using your popularity on YouTube for dumb shit. Your not funny and the shit your destroying people work there whole lives to acquire. Loser. You should just break your own bones for content. That's something I would watch.
Only three minutes in and you've hurt me more than I knew any man could. I'm kinda into it 😉...
Surprised it didn't catch fire.
If it’s red, it’s dead
Braking News: Italy declares war against the US for crimes against Ferraris. (And also what you did to pasta)
what's in those boxes on the wall
Awesome video man 👍👍🤣
Called it, knew it was gonna be on trending
Keep posting the good and hilarious content and keep posting it on social platforms so that you don’t have a problem getting the wrong message and not having a bad message or a good idea to post the same stuff

I don’t even need a make a wish anymore.. Cody that’s a wish come true 😂🎉  I get red n it’s dead too 🤷‍♂️

I don’t know how people will hate this video it is funny plus seeing this man have fun that he deserves and the amount of work he’s put in  haters tears 😢
At least it wasn't a Lambo!
Make a squatted Ferrari with just lifting the front
Lmao looks like me playing forza
Drive it through a fire I wan see some more content
ferrari lawyers be like ayo guys hear me out
Really needs to get a built rally car
So that hillclimb game is bullshit? 🤔
Anyone else notice the Lamborghini cover on the Ferrari in the beginning of the video?
definitely need a rally classic next
You can beat up a car all day long but Spitting on the logo was crazy disrespectful. Dude is gonna get black listed crazy lol
I'd def make a graveyard beside your warning sign to the property every few episodes  add a few plots🤣
How can this be REAL?  Explain. Thanks
I want that exhaust lol
*Ferrari lawyers enters the chat*
That has to be great advertising for the car bubble
thank God it has PPF
the true winner here is the bubble seller!
That bubble was as impressive as the way that car handled the off-roading!
Best use of a turd car ever
Whistlin is the embodiment of intrusive thoughts
That Balloon is definitely not from China... That shit would of popped with tiny ladder.
Chingon
False advertisement
this is so friggin sweet lol
bro playing gta irl
You love to see it 🤙
I dont even like my car that much and I'm sold on that bubble Holy shit.  The first whistlin diesel proof product we've ever seen.
Bro’s in Forza horizon 4 with his driving
I buy expensive shoes and mud them and crease them videos are on my channel
please fck this thing up cody😭
So you CAN drive them like in Forza after all...
Lmaooo buy a rally car and drive it to its limit
Stress test a Boeing 747 next
If any company came up with a product to WD proof something….they’d  have it made. Throw more pokey things at the bubble! 😂😂
Dude is the definition of F you money 💀
This is content worth watching
Lmao the end 😂
Let’s see how durable this car is
Please send me some $ so I can have fun too haha
Well yeah ok sure but what if you threw ANOTHER Ferrari at the bubble wrapped Ferrari?
Ferrari should be thanking him
Put the Ferrari exhaust on one of your trucjs
Somebody has a new sponsor
the bubble scene has got to be the funniest thing ive seen in a while
should have put a twin turbo on it XD
It honestly hurts to see u destroy shit most only dream of owning
The ending gave me flashbacks to the wrench fight video :D I wonder if the bubble is enough to protect the car in a flood... or to safely drag it across a pond.... or the sea
The price of my house getting fucked so easy.
you forgot to throw the kitchen sink at it
Keep using your vehicles man i remember when you just started out. Let those intrusive thoughts win my dude
Need to do a urus test
You're just a damn stupid pour kid...shame on you
U gonna get sued, dads money😢 jk, been here since the duramax on drag slicks
Next video: Ferrari sued me but ain't give a f*** about it
Day 1 of asking Cody to buy me a pair of travis scott Jordan 1 high Fragment
This is how I play forza
Put some all terrain tires on it and do more off roading. Install a hitch an tow a boat or something
Great now I want a Ferrari...
I almost feel denied that I didn't see the kitchen sink being thrown at the end. ...then again... "everything BUT the kitchen sink"...
The end had me rolling! The only thing I wish you would’ve threw was the freaking purse man! There was no purse….. come on wd!
Genuinely worried about the legal ramifications.... I love the videos!!
Im watching this before it goes down 😂
I don't care who you are, that right there is funny.
When you're done totaling it can I buy it for with the greatest president George Washington.
This is radical iconoclasm.
Is it just me or the last thing thrown should have been a Kitchen Sink?..
Bro is in forza IRL 😂
My dude is playing gta in real life
ferrari is going to sue you over this cody :smh:
Oh man ive been waiting for this moment for a year fuck yea I love if nice vid
Honestly this is the best video on yt rightnow, sry rarri'
Waiting on anvil vs Ferrari bubble shield...
Nintendo has sued for less
Wait is he living forza-horizon in real life?😂
Did youtube demonetize the best vid yet?
I think Cody has figured out he can buy whatever car he wants as long as he doesn’t completely destroy it and he just fixes it and keeps it for himself out of public eye. The lambo, g wagon, general lee, hiluxs, R8, skylines think about all the stuff that wasn’t completely destroyed can be fixed but we don’t hear about
That's why I only buy Saab
Marketing for Ferrarri, they should be greatful for your services.
I'm really poor. Maybe you could by my reconstructed title car for a few grand and have fun destroying it.
Enzo spinning in his grave.
And thats what we call ferrally
No kitchen sink?
Man I hadn't laughed like that in a while, cheers!!
Now i wonder, Was bubble Boy really immunocompromised or was he just a accident-prone idiot with really smart parents
I bet Ken Block is sitting up there smiling so hard, thinking damn why didn’t I try this.
Good advertisement for that bubble 😂
Best ending lolll
This guy is hilarious. Absolute genius. Best humor.
Tbh I enjoy him drifting that car in the gravel road!!! Bad ass
Why?
🇷🇺
That ending sequence of throwing shit was gold
That bubble is the real goat of the video

Thank you good sir for another red car upload .
That ending 😅
If you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a ball
Can someone tell me from where this man got so wealthy? Thanks. :)
Only one
First one
Everyone should be driving their cars.  There are 1.4 Billion registered cars in the world and I would guess 3-5x more unregistered cars, what are we going to do with them all, might as well enjoy them!
Bro is playing real life GTA
Streetspeed did what to a corvette? 😆 🤣
You need to lift it and jump it over a ocean 😂😂
Great advertising for the bubble, if nothing else.
I love you
Please shrink wrap the Ferrari by sucking all the air out the bubble 🙏🥺
As a lambo guy I enjoyed this video
Cody: give me a hammer His friends, turn into a firing squad
POV me in Forza horizon
You are an artist of destruction 👌
“Throw me a hammer” lol

https://youtu.be/Z6J95Nf_RXQ

WD NEEDS to be in GTA. This is gta5 vibes all duckling day. 😅
Part 2
Cody is a fkn legend. PERIOD
I literally think that WD is the most hated person out of our galaxy, not just planet earth 🤣
Top gear in the best years was like this😂

This reminds of 'TAX THE RICH' on YouTube. If you've never heard of it look it up. You're welcome
Regular forza horizon player

This is a great example of an ass with a Ferrari. As a car lover this video makes me sick.
YYEEEESSS 🔥🔥🔥
Ngl I also thought lawsuit as soon as I saw the thumbnail
Thank god for these videos because they’re the only thing in life that bring me joy
I love it how Cody spent 400,000 on a car and does whatever he wants
i tripple dog dare you to give away a ferrari

yep, he’s definitely getting black listed
pov: me who can't even afford half a button on that ferrari 🫣
The poor R8 that got hit from behind...
I strive to be able to reach the financial level of Ain't Care the WD has one day. All things considered, you were extremely gentle with your Ferrari!  Congrats!!
Impressive performance! Loved every second of it
Something tells me the diss on a ferrari 458 was a fu to daily driven exotics... well played
10:01 holy shit perfect drift déjà vu meme input 😂
This makes you just have a large grin on your face. Fuck ferrrari.

“You put it on and it protects it from stuff like helicopter crashes”
He’s living life like a video game character in GTA

Forza Horizon 6 will definitely include Cody's cars :)
we need nathan karhu to make a video with cody
You're livin the dream man that's so awesome
The exhaust sounds so good🤤
Would the bubble protect from a man armed with a banana?
GTA in real life
0:54 “more like a used 458, he is a broke boy who can’t afford big boy toys.” 🤣🤣 I would love to see this guys Ferrari
Anyone else notice all the additional cars in the lifts. In his garage that he’s acquired. Lol.  And  crazy to see him. Do all that to such a nice car. But not surprised. But iam surprised how it handled and held up.  Lol. Had me laughing the whole time. With alil nervous cringe.  Lol
o
Watching shit like this really annoys me. Pure lack of ideas for genuine good content.
Love it, driving like he's in Forza
“We do not care”
Red is dead
Ferrari would sue you over a car that belongs to you? This is practically free advertising.
Amazing video! 👏
The new forza is looking great!!
If you don’t want it just give it to me, I have never done things like this to my elantra
HELL YEAH KODY!!!!!!!!
This is why we love WhistlinDiesel
That thing is so sick !!!
Pretty sick that the car has held up so well already! Love the front hood “drain” 😂😂😂 And yeah, it’s like it has 4WD going up the hill, but how well does it fly through the air off a jump???? Show us.
Bro's playing Forza in real life...
Can the 336 lift it?
The Guy that sold it to Cody probably also is getting sued and Blacklisted by Ferrari. They are infamous for denying service to everyone they don´t seem to fit into Ferrari community.
Anyone else see the 2nd Ferrari in white in the back?!?
I love a ferrari but the company 🙃
throwing everything in the shop at the bubble lol
my ears really enjoyed the part where everything was thrown
Give it me i have no car 🥲🥲
Dudeeee! You gotta do a live action Need For Speed Hot pursuit 2 intro now! You got the Ferrari and the lambo and the gravel driveway!  Love it man!
You should get a bunch of money and burn It in front of a homeless shelter
waiting for the kitchen sink at the end haha
I could not stop smiling 😂😂
10:00 even when he’s bashing on ferrari look how much of a beauty it looks drifting down the hill 😩
Used to be a Lambo fan,not anymore! Rarri’s are mad.. Not long until we’ll see a Ferrari suv on the road,just because of you! Legend!!!!!!😅
Your livin the dream for sure
Just put like 5k miles on it with no maintenance, it will grenade itself.
@dde next car
The ending had me laughing my ass off I was waiting for one of them to get thrown 😂😂😂😂
Those are junk anyway! Smash it up man.
That thing is a ripper ! very impressive rally set-up Ferrari has
i love how its being destroyed but it looks damn good doing it
This is literally what I do in Forza Horizon, I’m glad to see it in real life!
I was smileing the whole time.hahaha
all cars should be treated equally good job
I have to say i am disappointed because the car is still intact and not completely destroyed
but Mcfly chickens can't fly ...
You should lift it and put off-road wheels on it
If it's red, it's dead
I gotta lie, I’m impressed.
that was fucking AWESOME!!!!!!! :D man i wish i could be around for stuff like this!!
Bro is driving it like I drive in forza every field I see
Whistilin dixie you can you 10 ads in your videos and I'd still watch them 😭💯

Video is absolutely nuts😂we love to see it📸
ferari proably in love with whistlin'.  yes, this is how people should treat our cars.  drive them enjoy them crash them buy more of them. yes!  should we offer him a sponsorship?   no!
This is Ali calling about ur cars extended warranty, we see that u have recently purchased a new Ferrari ?
Gekoloniseerd 🇳🇱🇳🇱🇳🇱🇳🇱

GTA was right, super cars are the best at off-road
Kinda reminds me of forza 🤣🤣
Wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be.... Guess he had to save some for part 2
I can't seem to find that website to buy that car bubble. After seeing your video, I trust that product with my car's safety. 10/10
I am gunna say this in every video from now on until u go it
The bubble protection company stock just quadrupled
Forza horizon 6???
bro only 1mill veivs on the Ferrari shadow band much rip
Wow. I kinda want a Ferrari now
Ok who wants to see the monster truck tire roll down the hill and hit the bubble lol
My man is missing a plate carrier to his "military outfit"
Listen I been watching you for a very long time what about a Toyota Tundra
Can't wait ferrari to send you to court and then all together laugh over them hahha
Why don’t you go to the Nurburgring with this thing??
I don't feel myself very well after watched this video...
The editing in these video’s makes them so much better
Cody is just playing gta at this point🤣🤣
this dude is gonna be the next taxtherich100
Bubble car thing👍 it will protect against various objects
I love that yellow snap-on box in the shop
That bubble thing is kinda cool
im crying inside but the vid was amazing
How did they throw that many things in such little time
Seriously tho, why did I see this video last night and then I just couldn’t find it again in the morning but now it’s back on his page
that's it, that's the best video
How could they sue if he owns the car?? Doesnt make sense
The title should be I rented a Ferrari for a few hours and drove through the mud
You finna go to court
Fez,er🚗sells r about to go up.. good review so far💯
Thank you for this 😂 😂😂  🖕the purists. Enjoy that red car your way 🎉
This dude will be one of those guys who people in the future will talk about. He is making a history, not a videos ❤️
Video feels like an Ad! Car held up pretty well
W commercial for that bubble at the end 😂
I want to see him drive it in the bubble like a hamster toy.

WTF BROOO!! hahahahha the final scene compplitly destroied me hahaha
All I'm seeing in the comment section is a butterfly people, nobody is ready to do this with their own cars. I still have no fu**ing idea what is funny about that kinda stuff.
amazing buy prob facebook ferrari group screeming at you like OH NO HE  BOUGHT A RED FERRARI TO DESTROY IT OMG WHY  also me Ma man

I would  let you kick on my balls 100 times. Rather than watching how Ferrari gets destroyed 😭😭
Is that a tax write off?
this is coool but also so hard to watch
But did he get the hammer?
Let me know if you need a detail .....
You really made it. I remember you doing silly things with your daily driver back in the beginning. Always knew you’d make it brother.
Speechless

The off-road shots were sick 😮🔥
How about blow up with a bazooka ? 😂😂😂😂
Now thats a youtube video!

Q: How to torture an Italian? A: Putting pineapple on pizza? A: No, using an F8 for rallying!
Would have loved pan over at the end to see how tired you guys were after throwing all that stuff. Lmao good shit keep it up
I think you are seriously owed a sponsorship from the Chinese bubble wrap consortium
Imagine you’re cruising through the back roads and see a ferrari drifting to on top of a hill. 🤣🤣🤣
You ain't scared of 4rahwee 🔥flame on
Don't hurt her bro there is a limit no matter what money is please I'll say it again please
Good ad for that bubble thing.

I’m so tagging Ferrari in this
More like SniffinDiesel.
i cry, and smile at the same time :D  Great Job,  :-)
Mark McCann would be proud.
The end was hilarious 😂
the editing is superior 🙈
What americans don't get is the disrespect people that have spend countless hours crafting this thing feel.  Money can buy a lot of things, but not respect.  Regardless of how many views you make.
Dude buy me a Ferrari or a svj Cody. I would so love to hang out and drive some badass cars and destroy stuff lol
So this how rich people play forza
Cody is a legend!!  That last part especially after he said "Give me a hammer!" and they chucked everything but the kitchen sink at it had me LMFAO!  Actually impressed that the Ferrari did reasonably well off road but it wasn't really the rough stuff.  Yet?  There's got to be part 2...car wasn't destroyed totally at the end of the video.
Cody keeps his cars as garage princess’s, such a shame non of them are ever driven 🙄
Bro After you destroy it can you Send The rest of it to me maybe i can get a m3 e92 or 335i e92 😂😂😂
I think whistlin diesel is going to buy every supercar and test until he buys a koenigsegg and hit it sledgehammer
Great commercial for that bubble wrap ! 👏🏼
Forza Horizon IRL
Again.. I am laughing so hard.  This will cause a epidemic level of seizures and freak outs in the Ferrari community. There is someone with a gun to their junk right now.  If they sold him one..  mine is not special anymore.  waaa..  I don't deserve to smash hot girls I paid for ...  BANG!!  So jealous man..  all of us would love to do this.
Thank you,,, thank you,,, thank you.
Forza in real life I love it ❤😂
Very disappointed in you. You threw everything but the kitchen sink at it.
Why 💔
I can’t wait for the haters to go crazy on TikTok
Great stuff
The amount of the stuff got me 😅😂
Farrari v WhistlinDiesel, ill wait.
The off-road capability of that Ferrari was impressive not gonna lie 👌
I felt like I am watching a Forza horizon challenge video while watching this video
The absolute best part of this venture is that he's going to keep this car going as long as it takes to push Ferrari over the edge and then once he does, he's gonna wreck the shit out of it cause what are they gonna do? Sue you for totalling the car? This series is gonna be epic! 😈😈😈
It’s like a tax the rich video
Id rather havd the hilux
new ferrari off roader coming soon
The Ferrari wanted level 💀💀💀💀👌👌👌
Crashed ferrari enzo happened in Jersey
Throws fucking everything at it 😂😭🤣
Now THAT'S DDE!
Basically an advert for the car cover. I’d buy 😂
You should do some boosted launches on banana skins
i hope you guys realize the hate comments do nothing. cody gives -0 fucks so… 😂 this videos great btw
Hahahaha just to be around for some of this! 😂😂 laughed my 🍑 off the whole time!
Why😭
Idiot 🤷‍♂️
Ferrari about to sue the shit out of him 😂😂😂
his voice is so annoying.  and so is his face.
Did it make the trending page yet?
World class entertainment right here!
You can now hangout with the super car owners to show them how their cars are supposed to be used 😂
Endless loop of bubble wrap defense incoming.
I need one of those bubbles!!!
4 minutes in I'm actually laughing out loud 😂 I absolutely love this shit 👌 please 🙏 don't ever stop Cody
Fuck you Ferrari!!
And @DDE channel complaining of someone using a sledgehammer in the windshield lol… keep it up brother
I love it 🤣🤣 thank you !!
This is insane. So dope
you through everything at but "the kitchen sink"
Hahahahahhaha this will be shown in high schools across the world 🌍 and in churches for sure 😃
I don't know why but this makes me happy😂
Durability test next?
Definitely going buy the bubble. It passed the assault test
anyone who thinks this guy is awesome for doing this to amazing cars is just as much as a tool as he is. stupid.
Woop, it's back up!!
10:32 STOP THIS IS A FIRE SCENE!!
This video is like watching someone play GTA and take insane cars off road. Just waiting for the monster truck Ferrari in Hawaii video to drop 😎
I think the main issue they have with people is when they modify the name or badge of Ferrari's
bro is in forza wtf 💀💀💀
I’m disappointed he ain’t destroy it guess he does care
This was one of the best videos he ever made!! Perfect
First thing that comes to mind hmmm …. Douche bags with with way too much money and pride in a red plastic piece of sh$t if I had 400k I could build 2 actually badass cars that would eat the ass out of it in 3d gear and if not would be so close it would still have fancy pants sweating his 400k decision lol just saying They’re fancy yes they’re overpriced and they’re delicate I’m rooting for you buddy can’t wait to see it get buried or just absolutely abused
Just brilliant 😂
Michael Schumacher😁 🏎👍🙏
Spy balloons. Net. Funniest shi t I heard all day
Legend.. here is comment for algorithm
This is something that I would do in Forza
Forza in real life
Ending had me cracking up!
This has got @taxtherich100 vibes
time for the seas and assist order
Sometimes I think your and idiot but good job on the videos man 🎉
brilliant .... can't wait for next level
never once did he think his small youtube account would turn into this
Lawsuit? Ferrari should use this as a commercial!
This is the content we need
This IS the best thing I've seen so far this year!!! Lmao 🤣
The last ten seconds though --- OMFG!
Love to see it
😂
✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾
Class, this guy has none.
Non stop side splitting laughter. Hey Cody, buy my truck when I get it put together, and give it the thorough test like the Ferrari got. I think it will survive, and if it does, I want it back. Peace!
This guy treats his ferrari much better than most owners do.
It had to be done by someone
the suspension looks working really good on that red one, pretty good travel also for such low car ; make it rally car? ;
Needs to test the durability of the new off-road huracan lol
Wow…. WD just keeps getting better and better. The CGI is unbelievable!
awesome video 😂😂
Guido and Luigi from Cars disapprove big time.
My boy spat on the logo 🤣🤣
Inzo is in heaven like,  "This is the same shht that happened with that guy Lamborghini."
I saw those covers n in the caption it said whistin diesel tested
Probably my favorite video yet. Car wasn't completely destroyed. However, he still beat tf outta it. And I'm thoroughly impressed on how long it survived sofar. Seeing it fully off-road was awesome, and imo it sounded different.
Ferrari like this Video 😂
Ferrari gonna put you on black bock and probably band you got life 😂😂😂
This is just awesomely insane 🤣🤣🤣
THE ARTILLERY SOUND EFFECTS THO….
1:29 look at the car in the back
Ferrari secret service is on the way
I can already see it in Hoovies, Bolians or Tavarishes garage in a few years down the road LMAO
That’s like Forza horizon
This guy is the only channel i watch the entire ad breaks because he deserves all the ad revenue
POV Ferrari :🤑🤑🤑
This video is just me in the mountains of San Andreas 🤣🤣🤣
This may be the end of Whistlindiesel
me in horizon be like
Everything but the kitchen sink
Lol I really can’t believe I watch that, but that bubble wrap needs to pay you that was a good demo on how good it works
Je pense que tes parents auraient du t'abandonner  à ta naissance Ou peut-être as tu été bercé trop près du mur ? T'es content et tu te torches avec des billets tous les jours j'imagine ? And how is the Ferrari now ? Just try with others cars like Porsche or Lamborghini and make a video as dumb as your face of sh...
Everyone is smiling, even the ones that need to turn themselves upside down!!!
All this false valor
Me in gta5
Ferrai should be proud of themselves for letting whistlin perform one of many durability tests and passing with flying colors so far
Normally I’m ok with him destroying cars and trucks and stuff but this is a little bid much. But it’s his money so he can do whatever he wants with it.
<3 nice video pushing the limits
When Ferrari activates WhistlinDiesel Mode and shoots out an bubble shield. Lol
The car condom review was 5 stars
You should rename the video to ” idiot getts used by ferrari
Amazing fun for drivers
Destroy it!!!💯🔥🔥🔥
Go to the sand dunes 😅
Never stop being you!
taking a car like this on a rally looks so fucking cool, you’re awesome
Wow this is classic! The end had me in tears how funny it was. Last little wrench thrown 😂😂😂. Can’t wait for part 2.
You forgot the kitchen sink
i mean if your not going to use it may i kindly ask, can i please have it. please
Ferrari will sue trillions, not millions
Bro is playing Forza i real Life
When the world needed him the most, he came back
Please take the excavator and dump the bucket on the roof!!!! xD
G Class the second hahah greetings from Germany my friends 🎉😂
No no no,ha,ha,ha yes yes YES
This is insane and i love this !
Needs a finish mower or other implement behind it. Farmerrari
But the true question. Is it as bulletproof as the 6.hoe?
Fucking beautiful. Love it
Gahhhhhhhhhhhdamnnnnnnnnn legend 🙌
Best video yet ☺️
Durability test gonna be lit
🔥
You are on the blacklist you must never buy a european car !!!!!!!
Laughing hard enough, my abs hurt, especially with the ending
Best fucking ending yet!!!!!
Ferrari board has urgent meeting
this is how the forza horizon games expect you to treat super cars
Test toyta camry 2009
Cody is the only one that can outdo his content. Definitely the best YouTuber on the planet. All these videos will be in history books
YES SMASH THAT FERRARI INTO OBLIVION I never knew we'd get this destruction video but this the destruction video we need.
bro this video is hilarious
Ending was amazing 😂😂
All the digs at Ferrari had me laughing but I genuinely have to admit that car actually impressed me for holding up and that bubble was shockingly way more effective than I expected.
Ich will
Wow look who's trying to show off with his stupid overpriced purchase. Pfft. Fiji water...
This hurts me a lot because I'm a big car guy so this hurts
I like that you have a radar detector so you know when a lawsuit is a mile away
bro accually used a ferrari the right way
Tomorrow on instagam the next rap post is Ferrari suing whistingdesiel😂 live your content homie
Supercharger and some mud wheel, then go to the track
* getting suid from ferrari *
i thought for sure the muffin sheet was getting through the bubble tho
Nice to see a Ferrari not being used as a pavement princess, I would love a Ferrari rally car
I love all your videos, keep it up
This is awesome! Ferrari either loves you for advertising or hates your guts 😂
You should have detailed it first
This may be your best video ever made
Gta in real life
He really just playing gta In real life
Absolutely love the spy balloon, especially when it was pelted with objects, my favorite of course the rc Baja truck. 🛻🪨⛰🌳🌲🐐
The first thing that comes to mind when someone’s says Ferrari I think of strategy errors
Smash it to bits ❤
Forza irl
Sacrilegio....
So many people getting triggered right now 🤣🤣
To be fair, he was quite gentle to it
It looks so good sideways on gravel
I had a great time watching this video and was smiling and laughing a lot! I am actually surprised how the Ferrari did. Actually, if anything, Ferrari should thank you for the promotion of their product, it seems kind of "robust".. at the same time, if you can now get car for $400.000, then the Chiron goal is NOT that far away I would say, great stuff!!
hes doing in real life what i do in gta
Why’s it so good off-road 😂😭😂
Who’s horse is that 😂
Bro this video is insane😂😂
Not even watched it yet but i love it
Did he get a fucking spray tan?😂😂😂😂😂
Best commercial add for that inflatable car balloon
lambo convert when?
Corvette fans will be triggered by this video.
Best video ever ❤
Everyone knows not to sell a collectible to WhistlinDiesel. Ferrari knew what would happen. Lol.
Basically bam magera 2.0 minus the MTV camera crew and pranks on your parents lol
He's definately on Ferrari's blacklist by now 😂
why is throwing random stuff the funniest thing😂😂😂
If I see you one day, I'll buff your face so you only buy wheelchairs.  Your cheap face ends up in the junkyard.
Thumbnail number 4?
Instead of destroying it do a rally car build?
it took me a while to realize this wasn't forza horizon
The content we’ve all been waiting for!! There is so many great things about this video I can’t even say them all. I think I laughed the entire 14 minutes. Patiently waiting for round 2!!
We used to throw apples at cars as kids. You should have an entire town of kids line up with a semi load of apples for ammo and just let them pelt you as you drive by. They’d all love it.
Ferrari must hate you
Reallife GTA5
Actually that is pretty durable and with cody good driving…actually the car look solidly good LOL
Man’s is playing BeamNG in real life.
this is mega epic
FERRARI CANT STOP THE LEGEND
This is the definition of daily driven exotics 😁
Legend af. Gotta love this channel!!
This is the best ad for that bubble in the world.
What the lambo do😭😭😭
The best definition of “we made it”😂
Hmm... maybe I should buy a Ferrari too!
this is one of the videos where nobody gives a fuck what you do to the car. ferrari did that to themselves.
Mc thicc 🤣🤣🤣
Bro…… lol…. We need to be friends…..
You could litteraly save thousands of lifes with that Money
My man went and did what every person has wanted to do to Ferrari but we don’t have the platform. Way to go Whistlin. Doing the lords work.
Bro boutta go to a special room to sign some papers
I guess from now on you have to get a second hand ferrari, I dont think they want to sell you a brand new one anymore :')
Where'd video go earlier ? Lol
Red is dead
Feels like those clickbait videos, but this one is real.
this is an average Cody moment
The ending was priceless!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I kinda wanna see it at the sand dunes
Wow 🤣👌💪
Love this one keep it up
This is something I'd do in forza horizon 5 lmfao
I liked the guest appearance from @adamlz 4:42
Dayı bu arabayı koyduğun balonu nerden aldın
Love this
Can't wait for Ferrari mulch
whats up with the piles of crates behind the ferrari? 12:20
I’ll like to buy this when you’re done with it
😂😂
and hopefully that was whistlin diesel r8
lift it like a crown vic
This was a good one. Rally Ferrari would be awesome
'clean title never been raced'
Genuinely impressed with the bubbles durability 😂 brought back wrench fight video vibes
Thank you so much!
Oddly satisfying 😁😁😁😁😁😊😊😊😊😊
Ferrari should use this as marketing
Can't wait for part 2!! 😁🔥🔥🔥
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA R.I.P 400.000 💵
Koningsegg just doesn’t care they are built different😂😂😂
I was just surprised that you have that much stuff readily available to throw when it was in the bubble 😂
This was the best video I saw this year. Just epic!!
My man HAS to lay in bed some nights and just think about how far he has came. From praying his chevy held together to make videos to buying a Ferrari just to destroy it. A car he probably never imagined owning 10 years ago.  It is absolutely wild to see what someone can do with sheer will and a little bit of luck.
i just want to know who the guy writing in the not pad lol cause is reaction to funny and is that there shop
Forza Horizon IRL
Boss
Bring it to the sand dunes
Plottwist: Ferrari proposes a deal for Whistlindiesel to durability test their cars.
Could have watched the end of that video for hours.  Hilarious!!
cody is living GTA
Ferrari's untouchable essence may take a bit of a blow here lol
Pretty impressive advertisement for the bubble manufacturer
this the last one you buying, and who cares
13:20 looks like ad for this bubble 😅
What will hurt the most to Ferrari is, if you sell it to me for 1 dollar.
14:11  you forgot the kitchen sink. But can I stop a bullet
So cringe yet so awesome 😂
question of the above, did u get sued?
it has finally happened.
Real life gta
and it back up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You gotta love this channel for the content
If Netflix tried to reproduces this the budget would probably be 2M  And this would still be more entertaining
What a disgrace 😐
W DIESEL RAHHHH AMERICA 🦅 🦅
I don’t know what is was about this episode but it was sooo funny! Way funnier than usual I think. Thanks Cody!
Brilliant 😂 I’d say the best YouTuber out there  loved his videos from the start . 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Holy fuck. Thank you for putting Ferrari in their place. Fuckin retards don't even like people repainting their cars.
Ferrari is going to have a shit show.
The end was by far the funniest shit I've seen in awhile.  Had me dieing
The end is the funniest part  the absolute pile of shit on the floor had me cramped up from laughter
Lmfao the best part is when you ask for the hammer
You forgot the kitchen sink!! 😂
Just looking for Ferrari in the comments saying you will see us in court
Hospital had never been so fun.  And because of the drugs it's like my first time watching this.  Content King. YouTube winner. Murderer of the Internet.  Come on coddyyyyyyy
13:18 threw everything at it but the kitchen sink
Thank you, I needed some of your humor!!!!
You know those are some grippy tires when they even hook offroad lol.
признаки психического расстройства,   у этого дурака
😆🤣😂 LOL
Wait Keller is now with Whistlin Diesel. Does that mean we are gonna see Wildcat in a Whistlin Diesel video.
for the love of god do not destroy that  landcruiser
I'm surprised they didn't throw a Ferrari at it
These companies should be paying you for these stress tests. Lmao. The anxiety I had watching this for the car and this bubble to boss it all. Real consumer advice here. Quality programming.
Cody is chicken can't destroy his car.  He got no balls.
Ohh Cody, how will you ever top this?
That C&D bout to hit diff 😂
Awesome!!!
tdi swap it
I love the screams when he throws the ladders off camera that’s funny
Really good add for that bubble 😂
I just like how cody’s got court and what not going on yet he still whips cars on the road lol
Bravo :')
P.R.I.C.K   Boring wrecking expensive stuff is getting bit old running out of ideas 😮😮
@13:45 sounds like the intro to, Pink Floyd - Time
We want part 2 😁😁
LIFT KIT

Genuinely could not stop laughing at the final clip of y’all throwing stuff at the bubble. Amazing content
Get ready for that cease-and-desist letter
Totally just made my Monday, laughed the whole way through
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Everything but the kitchen sink
I had to stop the video right before he entered his property and mentally prepare myself for the carnage that was about to take place on such a beautiful car!!! This one was actually painful to watch!!...
😂😂😂
Its funny, but it hurts too se such a beautiful car beaing treated so bad :D
yea, bwoi! nice vid!
💔😭
This video was a toe in the water to see what fararri will do.
Bro Ferrari's gonna have a heart attack when they see this

Brians even more questionable decisions.
Forget the Ferrari, the bubble durability test was incredible 🤣🤣
So is he promoting the air bubble case ? 😮😮😮 cuz I’m interested
This is like the phone drop test era for cars lmao
I think this video was sponsored by the bubble
Wow a ferarri
This dude 🤣🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
This is the most beautiful video on the internet.
thank you thank you thank you
reporteD 😂😂😂
Top G
13:08 “it’s even repelling me”.              * anti-W.D. proof.
Thanks Cody saves us from having to test them, your a true gent 😂
It needs tire chains
Once that you’re done with it, I would love to receive it as a gift 😊
LOL AT THE COMMENT WHO THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE A 458 lol He would never cheap out on destruction
The new gta looks sick
He's the American reincarnation of Tax The Rich
LIVLRG kewl dewd, got tank? doh.

Awesome 😂😂
You guys remember the channel tax the rich? Basically just this and I'm happy about that
Forza horizon is looking great these days 👌🤣
I’m impressed with the durability of the Ferrari.  You gotta step up your game Cody.
Ferraris aren't worth money, they are complete junk
Hey YouTube you’re gay if you take this down
Lmao do a little lift kit on it
Never disappoints
The crutch and Boots at the end got me
Next Video title: I put my Ferrari on 26” forces
alright, that was funny af
Wanna know how you avoid trouble with Ferrari? Just speak Italian, my guy. Or dub some Italian over your words. Just get some Italian in the video somewhere, you'll be fine.
When you can play forza in real life
how does this guy not have more subscribers
Cody’s playing Forza in real life😮‍💨
How'd the bubble do that
oh we are going to have a lot of fun with this red car in the future 😂😂
3:19- 3:44 had me rolling 😂😂😂
Turn it into a badass off-road car
Maybe the best video in YouTube right now! ❤️
@WhistlinDiesel You should get a tennis ball launcher and make the tennis balls light on fire then test the bubble.... Nobody throws wrenches anymore. If it can dodge a wrench I can dodge a ball right¿¿¿¿¿
I feel bad for him cleaning that shit up.
My dude playing Forza Horizon 12 over there.
real life video game driving im here for it
Seems about time for a rally race?
Clout feens😂😂😂😂
Hell of a marketing strategy just give the car protector to Cody
Disrespecting the history of visionary people in the past who pushed the cars and innovation to its limits is just awful 😞
ITS BAAACK
YES!!!! GET THAT MONEY CODY! You earned it. Love it.
Threw everything but the kitchen sink 😂
Ferrari watching this like 👁️👄👁️🗣️F***!!!!
Yess
Anyone else get a warm fuzzy feeling watching this? How about you @ferrari ?
Absolutely perfect.  Can't wait to see you wash your Interior like the old red duramax.
Can't wait Ferraris lawsuit
Cody has more money in plastic cases than I have in my 2 trucks.
This trailer for forza horizon 6 is really realistic!
Thank you for doing this fuck the haters
I love this channel
Noooo we want to see more!!!! Give us more! Cody is a legend
This is who I strive to be lol
Put gas all over it and use that fire house on it or put it in a crusher running with a brick on the gas!!!!
The lambo cover😂
Whistlindiesel yt upload, my day has become even better!
The absolute best! I’d come work for ya
Here I Am trying to buy a new computer for 3000.00 and not destroy it

Underrated Off-road Car
Sounds soo good lol 😂
Man’s playing real life forza 🤣
he threw everything at it minus the kitchen sink, i was disappointed
Playing real life forza
This is great
that is one damn good looking car
The most creatively destructive man alive! 😅
I’m am praying that Ferrari watches this and cries themselves to sleep
If there was still a dislike counter 99% of the dislikes would be from ferrari lawyers and people who work for the company or own it.... the list goes on and on
Fucking love it
Okay, I have to say it.  That looks so fucking good! now trash it
Bro the “like in a good way” meme cutaway had me spitting my drink.
damn. that car held up a LOT better than I expected. Especially the offroading drifts? not a bad 400k
4:38 is my supervisor with me at work
At this point he’s just playing Forza
Forza IRL
It's gotta be so much fun filming these videos.
Effing hilarious!
Love the whole video!! Can’t wait to see part 2 🤘🏻
Honestly absurdly impressed with how well it stood up to the terrain. Especially as a 2 wheel drive car
Commenting aging since the video went back up suck it YouTube 😂 why the f would you demonetize this video nothing was dangerous also Ferrari mad 💀
You dont have to try destroing a ferrari. The car shure will make it itself!
He didn’t have the balls to destroy it. You have gained my respect!
How did u get yt to put it back up?
I cum so hard
That ending was HILARIOUS!!!!!
This could be the 3rd engine MonsterMaxx needs!!
puke
That was awesome thanks for making awesome videos.
Really took it easy on this car. Lucky ahh car ong
Man this guy is going crazy 😂
Good luck Ferrari selling u a Ferrari after this
Cody’s playing forza in real life 😂
Yes!
😂 this was awesome brotha and did i see a muffin pan get tossed there lol
Best content creator out right now
Pls slowly  destroy this
4:40 isn't that Dave Sparks buddy?
Every human being driving a Ferrari in forza horizon:
It’s time to get my popcorn and sit back and enjoy the comments 🍿 😂
Everyone talking about how it did off road which was fantastic, but man does it sound amazing with that exhaust and bouncing off the limiter!
Ferrari  should thank you for doing a durability  test, and I'm surprised  with it so far 🤣
My anxiety is through the roof while watching this lmao
bro knows how to drive
Love you man but a 400k Ferrari I mean it is ur money but BROO a Ferrari Man come on that's how I know you got money to destroy a 400k Ferrari they finna sue you😭 next video title finna be  / DESTROYING A 5M DOLLAR BUGATTI 🙏.
Just think: the American Military shot a total of 5 missiles, each costing as much as this car, at a ballon and some kids science projects (according to them)
Love this ool
I’m Italian so pls don’t do anything to crazy. Or I’ll have a mental breakdown
its a toyota with an MR2 bodykit
Forza Horizon 6
Finanly the proper way to use a ferrari
perfect.
Cody driving a Ferrari through the fields is me when Inplay forza lol
"rally car baby" and "look how clean it's getting :)" are the most underrated lines of the video
Dude is playing forza horizon in real life
Cody out here playing Forza Horizon IRL
tell me you're a good car owner without telling me you're a good car owner
Can’t wait until you actually “destroy” it
Ferrari is going to find this video and sue ur ass, so watch out
If you're looking to sell it after your done, Richard Rawlings is buying totaled Ferraris lately! 🤣
Destroy these overrated bitch waiting for it
can i have it when youre done?
its up
All the new cars in the back
ferarri might sue him
Crazy lol
The end was epic 😂😂😂😂
So why was this video taken down?
@eatdatpussy445
@dailydrivenexotics
Ferrari isn't gonna like this....
We need to collab on this car!!!!
the caption alone :)))))))))
It's back.. whoo hoo 👌
that pour car bro
Oh No
🤏
nice
Does anyone else not see all the cars like mustangs and I thing charger I think 2 other lambos
Shoutout to those who have the link to this. Send it out to everyone 👀
this is now unlisted because of a ferrari lawsuit 😂😂😂
Why is this not available on the channel list anymore?
Ferrari were fast to act not gonna lie
Happy to have seen this video before Ferrari decides to take it down
Throwing all of the stuff at the car in that bubble is so funny!!!!!!
Bro, everytime I Watch your videos my heart is beating so fast😂
Let's not also forget Roman from PFI/boosted boiz getting sued by the legal owners of the Grinch 🤦
Ferrari's smart move would be to do nothing in this situation. That bubble company on the other hand should use every bit of this for marketing! What a great bubble.
Not all Ferra
We here at Ferrari would like to congratulate you on your new car.i hope you love and care for....HOLY CRAP !
Crazy the video got taken down
Here before lawsuit
Now it’s unlisted !
Not sure why but I can't stop smiling lol. You kill me as much as it pains me to watch I love every single second
Dang son, y’all sure know how to have fun.  That’ll be the first Ferrari that hasn’t been crashed by accident.   You sure can drive that thing  most Ferrari owners crash it just going to the grocery store.
Wow that bubble is faaaantastic, 🤣
Lmfao
Tbh Ferrari shouldn’t sue they should thank Cody and his crew. I don’t think we’ve seen anything like this done to a Ferrari and it takes a massive pair of adamantium balls to push this vehicle to these levels.  Overall it outperformed and we learned a ton about its capabilities. Even the bubble!!!
Omg that was great 😂😂😂
I thought you’d jump in that Ferrari😂
I love this haha way better than seeing one rip around Beverly Hills. It’s way more durable than I would’ve thought
The radar detector has me 💀
yes just yes more please
👌
The real winner here is whoever designed that car cocoon.  That thing is Cody proof.
its now unlisted, err thats not good.
iv got the same car, and im totally broke after watchin this :,DDDDDD
When the hell he get so many damn collector cars
So I guess he got sued lmao
That ending had me rolling 😅👍 good shit man ! ...😎👌THIS IS ENTERTAINMENT ‼️
Can't wait to see where/how this ends up 🤣🤣
he just reinvented the movie bubble boy
Cody might not be the hero this consooomerist world deserves but he sure is the one it needs.
Hard to watch as a car guy, but funny video. Hope F8 is ok 😂
😳.... Ok we need it ‼️ Ferrari Rock Crawler🙏🙏...  I mean it does come with a skid plate 🤡👌
How are the chances to get a job from you ? 😂 would cancel my whole live here in Germany 🤔😂
I couldn't find this video anywhere on YouTube when i searched it. Its not even showing up on your home page when I searched your account. The only way I could view this was because someone I knew shared it..! I'm guessing youtube already hates it....
The ending was gold 😂
Keep that nice and destroy the Audi.  "Cody" how about I destroy them both. Well said
Ohh finally this video! popcorn time
W
"Unlisted"?
Portal hubs and some paddle tires. That car could go a lot of places. I laughed 😅  through this video. Good job guys.
Shme:look there is a scratch!I will not sleep tonight.
why is this unlisted
You know he has @matarmstrong on speed dial for after this video 😂
Offre moi un Maverick x3 direct 😂🎉
My goal in life is to achieve this guys level of not giving a fuck
Difícilmente se puede ser más tonto.
Forza Horizon irl
I couldn’t watch 😭 probably the most entertaining thing I ever saw for cars!
Only the OGs can watch this video now
Dude that bubble is amazing. You literally threw everything at it and it held up. Great video man!
I laughed so hard at the end! Hilarious 😂
yeeeeee
This guy is too funny.love ur videos
Boy, that bubble is one tuff summbitch!
I can't believe YouTube would demonetize this video
This was AMAZING 😂😂😂😂😂😂
13:31 you missed throwing the blow up doll … 😂 that would’ve been hilarious
I freaking LOVE this shit! Dude, you are SOOOO on Ferrari's shit list you don't even know!
Ferrari made you unlist the video 💀
essa
The music I'm the first 30seconds of this video reminds me so much of the walking dead 😂
this video is already been unlisted, he must be in trouble 😂
Gta 5 ofline be like
Whoever made that car cover should be asking for rights to use for a commercial 😂
Why?
Video no longer listed. Did Ferrari get to him already.
Hate how hard YouTube is making it to watch new whistlindiesel videos as they don’t give me notifications even tho I have the bell ticked! This my favourite channel of all time!
we all know the tank is coming wonder if ferrari will make it to see the tank
Top G
If Youtube and Ferrari had just let him go and do his thing, this would have been a great advertisement, and might have even placed a dream in my head to one day own a Ferrari
Squatted Ferrari?
This ended up being a surprisingly good advertisement for Car Capsule lol, it's kind of crazy it held up against the bigger ladder.
Why is this masterpiece unlisted?
Where the video at RIP Duude
Bro, Ferarri is going have a field day with you - I can't wait to see the court battle.
Oh no! It's raining metal objects.
You really want Ferrari to get on to you go buy an SF90 and do a durability test on it.
Please take it to a dealership for an oil change 😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is going to hurt. But I’m watching anyways!!!! Cody your bat shit crazy and I love it!!!!
You got to love this guy lol
THE ending is CLASSIC!!! 🤣Reminds me of the other video they did where they had a fight in the garage with wrenches, sockets, and WHATEVER else they could get their hands on. ANYBODY remember the title of that video? Tried lookin up garage fight or wrench fight and couldn't find it.
God that ending was so funny for no damn Reason
Ferrari is literally the bully in middle school, no one cares and they can go f *** themselves
Can’t wait to see Cody get a bugatti and take it off road 😂😂😂 love the content 😊
Got to admit I'm a little let down. It said destroying not babying
This is a masterpiece 😢 especially the editing. You never fail to impress me you’re just good at ruining things 😂
Luckily I save the video link lol
bro unlisted it
One of the viewers who saw this video being hidden lol. I hope Ferrari learns from this and doesn't sue the rest of "normal" owners and let do to their vehicles whatever they want.
At the very end, I thought they were going to throw the G wagon that the air bubble Ferrari
Great video hope to see it public at sometime good luck  Its back up again 👍
i love this guy
Hahaha 😂 Cody money didn't change you 😜 your content is always awesome 😎💯so need for speed is accurate on everything 😂
i always thought no one would be crazy enough to put a ferrari to grind like taxtherich but i was totally wrong xD
HOW LONG HAVE YOU DRIVEN A CAR YOU'RE DAMN GO
yeah they aint gunna like that
I also don’t know how I just watched this with it being unlisted
This got taken down because you hit the cat…
It's funny, but it hurts.
when the video gets unlisted but you still find a way to watch it 😤
Love you man your the goat keep up the good work 😂😁
forundt the video lol
Y’all should’ve thrown a sink at it so you could’ve thrown everything including the kitchen sink 😂
Real Life GTA 😂😂. Love it
WRC Ferrari edition

13:20 bro forgot to turn off the tool magnet on his Ferrari (rookie mistake)
This video got took down lol

i wanna know what his wife thinks when she sees him doing this stuff
The greatest video ever! Well at least one of them. You have many. 🥳
This video is an accurate representation of how I treat these cars in forza 😂
I can't even afford a car but he's trying so hard to destroy this car . Love the channel 😂
Bro the video don't show up on his channel 😂😂😂
Why why why??? Is this because of Farreri?
I'm a little disappointed that a kitchen sink wasn't thrown at the bubble.
Can you test reverse top speed? And on grass
I assume you repair these cars after all the abuse, which makes me wonder... how much fucking money do you make for this to be an okay business decision xD
I can’t wait for the Bugatti 🙃
Glad someone is enjoying their sports car to the fullest
why is this masterpiece unlisted now?!?!
I’ve been watching the vids for 4 years and they just keep getting better every upload keep up the good content
loved the part where they destroy the car
Lol best fucking video in a long time!! Reminds me of the old school videos but with a high end car 😂
Started out smashing trucks, now look at you. 👽👍
wish I had more money than I knew what to do like wolf of wall street
This video doesn't show on your videos list nor can I find it via searching.  Can only access cause I watched it previously and have the URL
Ja
I need that bubble
Every video better than the last. Loving this
I love it man this is sick ❤❤
NO ONES GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW STROMG THAT BUBBLE IS🤔
it was only a matter of time when this would happen 💪😂
Reaper wheels next.
I want a rocket in the Ferrari when is going to happen?
i didnt even realize the video ended lol
What are all the containers on the wall for?
This is has to be Ferrari's least favorite video on the internet. I feel like they're gonna sue me for watching this.
Hell yeah Cody
why unlist ?
The Wolf of YouTube has made another purchase...
pull out the I N F I N I T E  B A G. YEET WHATS IN IT
I hate his face
F8 covered by EVO  😅
The funniest thing is that Ferrari is covered by Lamborghini cover 😆
Bros living in gta
“Lets try something else, gimme a hammer” 😂😂😂😂
Oh shit i thought this got shadow banned but i just seen its unlisted. Time to do a mkiv supra to really piss people off. This video was too righteous
Loving the content. Keep it up
Hilux v. F8 tug o war time!
the red horse
Hot
the subtle machine gun noises @13:50 🤣
He should really change his name to "Intrusive Thoughts"
This guy deserves a raise
Cody I know you’re reading this keep doing videos with this old style they’re so much better, that air mag video was respectfully treacherous
Can’t wait for that buggiti 😏
I can't believe nothing ripped the capsule the car was in at the end. It's a CarCapsule isn't it.
The muffin pan flung at the car had me dying.. bunch of random shit, here's comes the muffin pan 🤣
I want someone…eh em…to test the durability of Pangani mirrors. They look kinda weak
America
Youtube now put the monetization back on this video!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I watched the video before it got taken down
Who still watching after this was removed?
Very nice!👍🏼 I used to get the Hot Wheels that the doors would open on. I’d always end up breaking them off.  Break those doors off! I double dog dare you! 😂
That was fucking  awesome
When you bring Forza Horizon logic to life...
Whistlin Diesel drives like he is literally in Forza Horizon 5!!
my man is playing forza in irl good video
YouTube will not even show me this video in my subscriptions! Had to go to your channel to see it.
Guy playing forza horizon in real life
Feels like yesterday that he was destroying, in comparison, cheap vehicles. Sure has come a long way, I'd give him a compliment but then half the internet would have to call me names.
why unlisted the video?
did this video actually get taken down while i was watching it LMFAOO
Insane a YouTube favorite of Automotive Violence. 😂
This is forza IRL 😂🔥
This is hella of funny i needed this today
Why cant you find this video without a Link
Pure gold footage 😂😂😂😂😂
Drft car build
imo ferrari should pay you
this shit gonna be good lmfaoo
Very important educational torture test , I testify that if a company don’t like this they must be hiding something
Lift the rear end, get to wide open in top gear.  CUT THE ROPE  250MPH BURNOUT
Finally a Ferrari, been waiting for this series. Don't forget about some of the oldies, find some old classics and put them to rest. That will be sure to enrage the biggest generation of the 19th century.  Its just unfortunate that someone didn't end it by throwing the kitchen sink at it. The statement that would have made lol You missed a classic
Those rims will be wide enough for some big mud terrains and a fender delete
Lol
Enzo Ferrari is literally turning in his grave right now
Give it hell son, give it hell
how does cody think hes gonna get the bugatti at 10 million subscribers if he keeps buying cars like this💀💀
😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 noooooooooooo
Give it hell son, give it hell.
Lol this was a good one cody
The fact that this video went Private again for a while made me think he was getting sued!
When u don’t listen to the GPS in Forza Horizon
lmmfao the last 30sec of the video
This video unlisted? Got sued?
If it’s red, it’s dead
how every one should be used imo
Oooooh this was a good one 🥹🙇🏿‍♂️
Rl forza
Un enculer
9:13 This is muddy dirt! BAHAHAHA! #MerchThat
Tax the rich gonna make a comeback after this one
Watching after it went unlisted? o_O
Американский ЛИТВИН!
Why didn't you at least put a dent in it? It's like boning a chick and just when you're climaxing her Mom honks the horn for her to go to ballet class and she leaves you with to finish yourself.
Why don't you do a TESLA durability test!
why couldn’t i find this video on your channel? it says it’s unlisted…
Does anyone see that this isn’t on his YouTube channel anymore if you want to watch it you have to go through notifications. What happened did Ferrari sue you 😅
lovely way to present a rari :) , that end throwing was like music making
THE VIDEO GOT UNLISTED AHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA
Lamborghini is making an off-road Hurican why not the first off road Ferrari??
Aye lil bro, you'll really let me down when yall was throwing everything at the bubble and I didn't see a kitchen sink. As all the items were flying in I was saying aloud kitchen sink kitchen sink kitchen sink. But nooooo. Ferrari must have you shook. 🤦🏼‍♀️ Youre slippin in ur pimpin in your old age lol
First and foremost, my dreams of working for a exotic car don't seem like dreams anymore lol.  Secondly, Cody aka my Hero, dude, get you some throwing knives for that bubble.  That would be interesting.  If you don't know how to throw them, grab some throwing stars.  They're easier.  Perfect video dude!!
Bro why is this unlisted now👀
Real life Forza Horizon when people jump and crash their supercars cross-- country to gain stuntpoints or whatever... :) Nice ad for the car- bubble tho
16 hours later and he already had to take it down 😂
Very nice!🤣
That’s the best marketing advertising that Ferr… sorry I meant Bubble protection could ever wish for!!!
Monster max 3.0?
You should do a crash test
😂😂😂les go
Bruuuuh.. get you some off road tires, a top tier suspension kit or lift kit, an put it on a supercar. Im trynna see that 👀👀👀

Lol definitely couldn’t stop laughing through out the whole vid . Awesome video like always 👍🏼.. add some mud tires

Never fails to impress 😂
When i saw your video on the super expensive Nike's i was just like "i hope Nike dont sue him like Ferrari does to people who modify or destroy their cars online bcs 'its bad for our image' ". Then a day latter you just came up with this, awsome bro, i'm worried about you but at the same time curious to see were this gets.
🎉🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It looks like a giant Red RC car when he is driving it
Low key want to know where I can get WD's security top.. but with the belly let out a bit... :D
Brother invest some money into those teeth jeez
Best part was the end!🤣
Magnum pi is first word.
I thoroughly enjoyed that one, brought a year of joy to my eye seeing a Ferrari actually ripping it like it's supposed to...
He's gonna get sued ngl haha.
This was fantastic, Laughed the whole time. Congrats on the new red! y'all are absolutely hilarious.
bruh at least change the logo, what does Ferrari gonna do? I don't think they can do much
you need balls of steel to watch this OMFG..............!!!
We want mulch, and send Ferrari some XD lmao
😂😂😂😂
I’d buy it just for ferri gloves
Bros a legend😂
Brilliant!
Amazing
Mans playing real life forza horizon
That one Ferrari employee watching 😟
New forza horizon looks good
You need to race it at Freedom Factory against Cletus 😂
Literally TaxTheRich but live and in person lol. Love it
Nothing is sacred
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’ve never cared about him ruining cars and trucks but this one kinda hurts🥺
Official ferrari dealer did run back milage on used cars to sell them for more. Google it up it was big case, like it so other know that ferrari is cheating bitch ass company so fuck em maccaronnis
Less quantity, more quality.  Thumbs up.
this is actually an amazing video!
All the pictures of Ferraris killed me 😂
This is actually next-next-next level stuff hahahah You crazy ass mofo! much love from Canada, keep the good stuff comin mate!
He is playing real Forza horizon. trail Blazer!
Not sure why the ending was funny lmao but it was
Ferrari should be proud!!!!
This video should be called "I'm getting sued"
Patiently Waiting on electric versions of super cars 😂💯
that end was like Ferrari has stepped in war zone 🤣🤣 Keep up the best content 👌
Whistlindiesel and his team have gotten so good at making content you cannot stop watching. Literally grinning ear-to-ear the whole time.
Get a k truck lol
next level, i had to watch it twice
Your stupid
Cody has brought smiles to Ferrari  owners everywhere . ☺️
is it bullet proof?
😂 I wanna be rich like this
😂
This is what we like to see, w of a video
try to drive under random Semi truck on the highway
Man play real life forza horizon
😂😂Never had so much fun watching a video😂😂
that’s an impressive bubble
I like your latest car! Very nice. You should have a roof rack for the protector.
40000 dollar Ferrari  25 second barrage of pipes hammers tires wrenches road signs ladders and possibly Bowling balls  Must have been 40 guys behind the camera  Sickening senseless wasteful and fucking hilarious  I just love this smart ass
Note that he had posted “I would never commit suicide”
Let me know when to expect Ferrari mulch😂😂😂
😳😳🥺🥺🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭💀💀💀
New fav whistlin diesel video
Just good clean fun!
I Like all cars in background we haven't seen video off yet, what's story behind them personal or just for testing purposes
This seems more like a testament to Ferraris ability to drift and drive offroad
If it’s read it’s dead
The Ferrari probably like watching this video and saying like you….you…you just did not to that.
I dunno where you bought that bubble thing... but honestly that is mighty impressive how well that held up.
imagine being rich enough to laugh ab being sued😭😭😂
This woulda been an awesome sponsorship video for that bubble lmfao
Can't spell WhistlinDiesel without the W
You will literally go down in history
Can’t wait to buy some jars…
Related to lawsuits, I'm from Romania and we have here a tractor factory, IRUM and they have a horse on their logo, Ferrari call them to court because of this... the logos are totally different, you cannot mistakenly confuse them... you can search on the internet for the story, what a shit show.
reminds me of tax the rich man i missed that channel
Make everyone mad and do it with a Supra
that's awesome hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha that had laughing the whole time
Literally the best one out there. The anxiety I got with all the ladders was both expected and hilarious
This is what i did in gtA 5 fr!😂😭
Bro if that car bag thinger-ma-bob company don't send you a fat check then that's just messed up!!..
Idk i think ferrari would be ridiculous to pose a lawsuit as that car handled everything pretty well. Im not a farrari fan but this video speaks for itself
Where did you buy the bubble protector you put the Ferrari in?  How much did it cost? Size of the bubble?  Can you put a crewmax Tundra in it?
Lil weak video
Jeez Louise.  This is painful to watch but in typical WD fashion I can't turn away.. And this is coming from a Ferrari owner
This video is a cinematic masterpiece
EV Hummer durability test.....🚀
I saw that AMG 6.2 V8 and I need to see content with that
Buy a Bugatti and v13 swap itttt
I thought cars and trucks mean nothing to you, lol take that mf actually Muddy bye bye car
It’s illegal to have this much fun in a ferrari
Playing forza in real life
Hahahaha awesome
Will the carbon doors stop a .50cal?
I smell Ferrari from a mile away
Codys' got me giggling like a schoolgirl about to get her first kiss.
Throwing the crutches at the China balloon had me in ducking stitches. Out fucking standing effort 😂😂😂😂
can i buy the destroyed ferrari?
You gotta do a cyber truck when they come out
13:18 does anyone remember the Wrench Fight video from a few years ago that got taken down? Well this part just reminded me of it 😂
You legit MUST FILTHY RICHER Than we could imagine 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤮👍🏾👍🏾🤷🏽‍♂️ do you G

Well, I hope you made an investment into the bubble thing beforehand cause that proved the use case
Nice Ferrari commercial
nice
So funny elowell
I’m an old guy and this video pops up.  “Let me see what the kids are up to today”.  Hot dang kids, I couldn’t stop watching and laughing.  I may be your oldest sub now.  HAHAHA
I am more impressed with that ballon garage thingy than the Ferrari...
You need to buy a sink to throw at the bubble or whatever your throwing stuff at
My dude is playing Horizon 5 in real life
Hey you didn’t destroy it
Next
This was fantastic 👏
Do a mitsubishi eclipse
yoooo that’s awesome, i can’t believe that’s a legit ferrari, can’t wait for the next videos on it!
I would love to have this beast please send it to me when done with it
Do mitsubishi eclipse please 🙏
Look how clean it’s getting😂🤣
I've been waiting for a vid for two weeks... thx whistlindiesel
This is the most awesomely insane video my eyes have seen
"we need to be careful with what we hit" *Instantly drives through a gate*
That was awesome throwing everything at it at the end was the funniest part
I love this so much that I couldnt be forced to hate it at gunpoint
10:30 Stop! STOP! STOPPP
Everyone’s worried about the car I’m just impressed that it gets around that well 😂
There’s an abandoned racetrack over near you called the riverview speedway in smith county. 200k I think it’s a 1/4 mile
Im waiting for daily driven exotics to comment! Damon is probably pissing himself laughing
I’m so excited for this, because it reminds me of the days of the any level.
I hope you get sponsored by that bubble thing.  That was awesome
Can we talk about how so many people hate this guy but he has 4m subscribers lol
May God bless you all.
And we all laughed at GTA V for making super cars great off-road...
Clickbait
Do you remember when they would show two little people on your shoulders giving you advice?  One was dressed in red with a forked tail telling you,  "Go for it" and the other dressed all in white explaining how to do the right thing.  Every damn time they would follow the guy in white and the world was full of unicorns and puppy dog kisses.  Instead of going straight to Heaven,  Diesel is getting to go everywhere with a big smile on his face.  Turns out a huge line ahead of him full of the "haters", the "do good-ers" (when someone is watching) and "Karens" already had front row tickets to an eternity below.   Guess Diesel will be here with us for a long time from now.   Godspeed my friend.
no dupa troche boli nie ukrywam
Can I have a piece of it?
salesmen that sold him the ferrari in his dms day later asking for a job hahaha
this is the only content i come on youtube for
The red hilux is still the prettiest vehicle but man this video was awesome
good job on not breaking the RED 🚗
Somebody that buys a pony car and actually drives it how cars are supposed to drive? Holy shit no way.
Love every second of it MORE PLEASEE
I like the Bentley back there ! destroy it 😁
Wow that’s a cool and fast and red and sports car !
False advertising the Ferrari was not destroyed within the 10 minutes period in which you claimed so in doing so I will be contacting my lawyers as you will be Receiving a notice to appear for court proceedings to  settle this issue
Omg. Every time i thought you did the impossible, you come up with crazier ideas, you got my full respect. The sound of this car gave me chills.
We get it, your rich and dont give af 🙄
Im not sure what I loved more, watching Cody beat on the Ferarri or watching my wifes discomfort seeing someone beating on 400k. Either way, many laughs!
funny shit
That bubble is strong AF tho 😂
Ferrari will sue you
So fun😅
💀
I like how you take these  Ridiculous priced items and demolish them. It pisses so many people off.   Really pushes them off there high horse.
peoples are working one month for only "20$" in africa. and you just destroy 400k$ for a fkin video. you are an ignorant lacking empathy.  I feel sorry for you and people like you. sorry, just said that.
Lol  guy at 4:41 I had a waiter like that once when I tried to order Poached Pheasant breasts out of season
forza horizon type of beat
Hey man. Can I have those gloves ?
I had no clue GTAV was so realistic when I drove an adder straight up Chiliad
Cease and desist incoming
day two of waiting for the ferrari to get destroyed.
How many hilux’s this guy uses at the same time
5:46 😆😆😆😆😆😂😂😂😂😂😂
The bubble wrap is the hero we didn't know we needed
Hopefully in part 2 it will be totaled that thing looked really good going off road
nice
I'm crying, I'm laughing...I'm crying, I'm laughing...I'm crying, I'm LAUGHING! Thank you!
The gag at the end was fkn perfect 👌
Thats soooo funny watching it go up hills lol    Has to be fun  &  sound real good
He didn't destroy it though. But judging by the comments, I'm the only one disappointed by that
...the young rascal has spirit😁
Cody is what dreams are made of . This is tooooo good
Definitely the best video ending so far.
I really love your content I want to be a really out of the box creator like you but I am not blessed with so much money can I beg you for your Merc Gwagon I am from India its really a luxury here I would take good care of it please man 💙💙 I am Niladri Das from India 🇮🇳 we love your content here
Loved this video kept me smiling the entire time honestly
Honestly I don’t know what I’m more impressed about, the fact that the car is NOT totaled after 1 video, OR, that protective bubble thing….. that thing took a beating and nothing hit the car….
Insane 2wd she can survive
Can I have what’s left when your done with it 😊
they should have never gave you rednecks money! 🤣🤣
That was awesome!!! What's with all the crates in his shop?
Gta real life
13:07 This would be a 10/10 and for that car cover
Douching is the first word I think of
Next time can you do a roll's royce
step 2 needs a lift and truck wheels
loved it, best part was the end by far
Most people like myself could care less for exotic cars destroy a rare GNX only 547 of those
This guy is litterally playing BeamNG in real life
If those bubbles makers don’t use the end as a commercial
Noice
Cody's literally playing forza in real life
pov you play forza
Now this is what I enjoy
Ferraris  legal team is all chubbed up. I bet they’re  all putting condoms on their strapons now.
This reminds me how I drive in Forza Horizon 5 lol Cody is just doing it in real life for me!
i have been waiting for someone like TaxTheRich lol
This totally needs a lift kit and monster truck wheels.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I’m surprised that thing is 2wd but 😂😂 dang bro this is crazy to watch 😂😂
I think he should buy stradmans Bugatti through a 3rd party and then slowly endurance test it 🤣
hey cody do you know they are shaped like a jet because they can fly? you should try it
I’ve never laughed so much during a car video
its probably got ppf , so no worries.
Give me a Hammer........ Hahahahaha 😂😂
Lady used, highway miles, home use only, very carefully maintained
Nothing broke lol
The thing sounds like a Sandhill Crane
Plot Twist.. this was a giant ad for the car bubble... great video tho!!
why does the number plane disapear and come back again
This was actually so good and funny.
Wait he hit the center of the steering wheel… what’s wrong with the horn
I got two red fords I’d be nervous to drive them around Cody 😂but then again if he did destroy one he be like here a replacement truck bro 😂
I feel like this is more of a review of the balloon than thrashing the Ferrari
Enzo Ferrari rolling in his grave😭😂😭😂😭😭
The loss of the Toyota had a more meaningful effect on the world than the loss of this Ferrari will.
I nearly fell off the Treadmill watching this at the Gym.... (some may be more shocked that I go to the gym than this video!)
11:06 after eating taco bell
living every ones dream
กูยอมมึงแล้วลูกพี่
Damn
Time to invest in car bubble protectors!

I’m a HUGE Ferrari AND I CAN’T… stop laughing. 😂😂
Fuck yes!

Am I the only one that was afraid he was gonna hit the Hilux 🤣
Ok I'm sold
5:52 My Teeth Started To Grind
Lmfao. That did better than I thought on dirt. You're awesome.
Thanks for that Cody
Is this need for speed lol
Please destroy it!!!!!!!!!!!
When yall getting sued ???
Since you cross threaded the tow hook, you should take a chain through the air vent on the front and pull it that way in case you get stuck
My favorite YouTuber 🤣😂 doesn't give a French
Haha...lol you tube is responsible for so many cars being destroyed.... 💥
TaxTheRich kinda vibes fr
Take it to Silver Lake. It was clearly meant for it.
This dude is a living legend 😎😱
Yeah, they’ll be coming to get that😂. Ferrari swat
Skip to @12:12 for a good laugh 😃
Bro living in real life FH5 😂
Should have sanded the fucking paint off and tell Ferrari to go suck it
Just the fact he's using a lamborghini car cover is jokes. Love your vids bro so funny 👍🤣
It’s just sad…
you're crazy ,poor ferrari
This is soooooo hard to watch, destroying one of my dream cars 😢
Real life Forza Horizon
🤣🤣😂😂😂
You're out here playing Forza Horizon in real life, I love it.
Can I buy the busted Ferrari? I can sell parts to buy my kids vehicles… when you’re done of course lol
Fh5 irl
Red is my favorite color.
it’s like watching an 8 year old play gta, love it.
Oh my god the last 15 seconds hahahaha (even if you hate whistlindiesel you’ll laugh 😂)
Also, Ferrari like to cheat to win while racing sometimes) And not acknowledge it
This is the best!
He drives it in real life like I drive my cars in Forza 😭😭
Not gonna lie, was expecting some juicey Cinematics (Like the Salt flats). After I finished laughing for 14 mins, I realised it wasn't needed ❤️❤️❤️ WD
Any one notice the Military storage totes and accessories piled up next to Ferrari?  1800 fbi snitch
Imagine being such a horrible company that you try to sue your customers for modifying something they legally own.  I'm legitimately surprised they are even still in business with such horrible service 🤣
I wanna see the behind the scenes of everybody tossing the stuff at the car lmao
oh shit a bunch of italians swarming your house ☠️
Supra durability test next?
10/10 stud
This protection buble can't be popped/damaged
Ferrari more like No-more-rari 🥁
The amount of stuff that got tossed at it was absolutely hilarious
Just sold me on a car shield 💀
I lost it at the end 😂😂😂😂 best video by far😂😂
doubt you’ll see this but thx for the being the best video and first video i watched after being in the hospital for the past week. some of these cars ain’t durable and we need you to show us which ones we should get.
Send it
Fuckarari ❤️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
The specieof men need to be preserved .🤣😂
That was your last Ferrari
Ferrari executive watching: CODYYYY NOOOOOOO
13:16 now bubble company needs to pay you for ad on what it can withstand
Even Ferrari testers were afraid of testing it this hard, they were like no need to go that far since it won’t be used for off-roading. 😂 how wrong.
The people who don’t understand will never have the pleasure of enjoying these videos!  Loved the video and looking forward to the update!
This whole video was a panic attack
Yessss!!!! And thank you!!!!!
Rich folk problems lol
This was one of the best things I've ever seen, improved my mood
Time for a Magnum P.I. skit
aderfeeeee ti exeis pathei hahahahahah
Just found myself watching this video for the third time in 14 hours.
Can’t wait till WD gets a Bugatti
This was absolute comedy genius the whole way thru, i dont care it takes week for a video to come out. this was a riot, laughing the whole way thru. and the one last tool flying in at the end 😂😂😂😂😂😂🔧🔧🔧🔧🤣🤣🤣🤣 i was done 😂😂😂😂
Some great advertisement for the car bubble company
Wow! Gotta get that cover…it’s actually WhistlinDiesel proof…LOL
Like a throw back but with more money
That Ferrari was absolutely EATING. Wow
That was absolutely hilarious
Please destroy expensive mountain bikes next
Thanks Cody, I finally found my 13:17 Zombie Bunker Bubble.  Now I’ll be safe next year.
i thought he said he wanted a hammer not my entire toolkit that i stole   *jk*
Isn’t that Ferrari gonna Sue them? For like smashing the car on purpose
Destroy did you used to be all with trucks now you’re just All cars
bros living life how i play gta
Half way through the video praying he does a ford vs Ferrari 🙏 😭  please buy the new ford GT and race them!!!!!
Would be cool if you set a specific track across your property and timed each new car just to see their capability and compare them to eachother
How many fuckin people did you have back there throwing shit 🤣🤣
Yo please please make videos like these...YOU GUYS MADE MY DAY🍻
Well we learned that transparent spy bubbles are as durable as a Hilux
Alternative title: Forza horizon IRL
yes new and more content!! keep diggin
Shall we make the video so absurd they can't stop watching? ....YES.
If you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a hammer
,,Ferarri we are more lawsuit then car company at this point"
Best content on utube
Their just overpriced objects it’s all materialistic stuff some people fail to realize he don’t care, that’s what I salute🫡
I think Cody is actually becoming a better drifter!! 😂 bruh quiet down I can see when you being loud!! AYY look how clean it’s getting! 😂best parts!!
U should put mud tires for extra durability and tracking
"I think that did pretty well- let's try something else.  Gimme a hammer" - literally everything is thrown at it Hahahaha!!
Was diesel dropped on his head when he was younger?    Nice car
Wowwww you're cool 😂🤡
Of all the things in this video I’m pretty jealous of that nice team Wendy helmet 😂
Trailer to forza horizon 6
At this point he's just playing Forza Horizon in real life
it's funny how the comment section has completely changed since he started making videos.  everyone enjoys this now instead of daddy's money comments . lol
Its hard for me to watch these at work, I end up laughing like a midget running through tall grass.
When you crash it turn it into a rally car
Cool to see a Ferrari actually getting beat on instead of white gloves and man that sound is so good
Tbh that was good advertisement for Ferrari. Good shots
“Give me a hammer”  Proceeds to through the whole tool kit at it 🤣
why you doing this?    if yo uhawe money, hawe some knovlidge, why you are not helping people.  yo uhawe garage. why you not helping this young future mechanic in school to hawe opertunity to learn to fix cars.  why you destroying staf?  why you not helping people. you were uniform. if you were uniform you must ack liek it. be soldier. sodier do nto do this thinks.  why you not helping kids, to stay away from drogs, alcohol?????  you think u are tought guy. nobody will remebr you for this shit.  women, girls, ladies, man, father could hawe you for coreckt person. for good guy.  they would respet you.  why  you doing this?   i come from wery small coutry.  i know countries where people hawe no watter, nothing. and u are destroying some car.  why you doing this?   shame.
Love your videos man 💪🏼
tax the rich guy did it first but not even close lol
Oh shit 😂😂
Only man on earth that proved me that video game physics make sense 💀
I'm surprised it rolled up tire roll down hill
Just make sure you change the oil every 1 miles, Ferrari is very picky about that and pick up an extension cord for the battery charger so you can plug it in while off-roading.
So where you get the bubble from? 😅
Your success is truly inspiring.. Living in a GTA world!!
Art
Ferrari should be honored to have you test there car you don't just buy cars willy nilly to test you have more class then that. You however will probably have the honor of being the first to see there Swat Team come and get you tho 😉
This guy is playing Forza in real life
NO YOU FKING DIDNT.WHYYYYYYYYYYY
Bro u r a Gigachad...Respect from all
You chucked just about everything at it apart from a sink
Lift, bigger tires and make it go thru a obstacle course.
He’s gonna get banned from buying them
I feel like this isn’t over
ok - though I LOL'd through the video - I REALLY LOL'd when you stepped out of the Purrari in the Thicc-fil-A camo/helmet.  🤣🤣😂😂
W whistlinD
Since my Nick names are from different Undead Abominations of Lilith Werewolves and Vampires are "Angelic" "Guardian of the Gate" AKA Hell🔥Fire....Well Bible states 7 Seals and White Horseman 🛸🧬😇🗡️👁️ is "Angelic" "Come and See" if You read Ezekiel chapter 1 talks about the Aliens and their Spaceship🛸. Also my alien spacecraft 🛸 Egg Shaped 🥚 between Nashville TN to Chicago Illinois saw it above the clouds in Airplane ✈️ leading us 200ft down right, we both were above the ☁️ clouds sun shining and I pointed it out to guy next to me as I sit window seat. He saw it also, we watch it for 15 minutes. I first asked him if he saw it. He said "Yes" I said "Do You Know What It is?" He said "No" I said "I know what it is!" He said "What is it?" I said "It's a UFO". I looked it up it read that's it's The Nordic Sky Brothers 😇🧬🛸🖖🏻🤙🏻..... But do you think... If I located the 7 Seals which heard they been broken Wrong....If I did my Prayer Gridding 🙏🏻🧙🏻‍♂️✨⚖️🧭🗺️👁️ there at the locations as My Sky Brothers watching may work🤷🏻‍♂️...
I hope that bubble company pays you for the free advertising 😂
POV: forza horizon in real life
Well I’m really excited about this!
Car brands should make you the car tester 😂😂
Surprisingly it handled well on gravel ¯⁠\⁠_⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠_⁠/⁠¯
I’m more impressed by the bubble
When u play forza:v 9:41
5:36 ☺️
after this video you can never buy a ferrari because they put in blacklist this is probably his first and the last ferrari :D
13:17 and on is YT gold
Imaginr having so much money that you can drift a ferrari offroad
Honestly impressed! Great video
i love how he has bieng wearing UF PRO the whole time when destroying the gayrrari
Do a ford gt next
Before you buy a ferrari, please get a lawyer.
guarantee you’ll be smiling through this entire video. 😂
dude had sponsorship for 35k nike and not a single ad for 400k car lol
At this point he's playing irl Forza Horizon
That Ferrari held up pretty well, I’m really surprise that it’s that durable. I kinda hurt me watching you destroy this, but damn, it’s pretty sturdy.
I would never buy a car from a company that doesn't regard it as my car lol. Ferrari are mentalists lol.
This dude is like what if Forza Horizon was real🤣
Worlds first Ferrari built for off-roading 😂😂
See if the Ferrari can make it in the ocean
Is a good form to prove that Ferrari f8
the advertising for that bubble was on point got a tell ya
As a millennial and with someone that has a sense of humour, this is the best advertising Ferrari could get. Cos that is one sexy car.  I also think the bubble with everything being thrown at it is quality entertainment. Was waiting for a moltov cocktail or a shoe tho 😂
New monster max body
Oh god here we go
maaaaaa whistling diesel just uploaded dont bother me get me a beer and popcorn
So darn funny ahahha
THE GOAT
You remembered everything but the kitchen sink
I care more about the Toyota trucks then what you do with this Ferrari 😂
bro can u give me a ferrari
I love that you buy a 400k car and drive like you stole it. Good for you you can afford it, I can’t even afford to do this to my subaru lol
Need more videos like this!!
I'm more impressed with the car bubble.
koenigsegg should make you their new car tester
This man lives like it's gta and I love it
This guy drives cars like we do on Forza but in real life
You not destroy the car? I don't see your car damage, fender, broke window other ect .go back to school and *"learn how to destroy."  this video Make no sense. Change your title to"(I'm ride my $400,000 car on the mountain.") LoL  LOSER

It’s the Lamborghini car cover for me😂
Dang I was waiting for the kitchen sink 😢
but what is all the ammo crates.  also cool ferrari
But why you want to change Ferrari Rules? Is stupid
you should make the license plate "Sue me" or "Su3 Me"
This is probably my favorite video ever.

I know people's going to be like oh no a Ferrari this is stupid. However I absolutely loved the utter disregard!  Might As well been a Honda accord!
Hey can I have that stock ferrari exhaust? For……research….
I don’t care that you destroy this Ferrari because it’s your money. but it it’s hard to see this being destroyed
Plz don’t destroy the ferrari and can you do a vid on getting a old Land Rover defender and just going off-roading with it
Is it me. Or do Ferraris just look better on muddy roads.
Really sexy car this was hard to watch lol
Durramax swapped Ferrari 🤔🤔
V O L V O
nice
I lost it at the muffin tin, like wtf was that even doing in there?
He is like the kid you don’t want to leave around your pets. Except with cars.
Greatest car reviewer ever
Ferrari owes you a big thank you after this!!
🤣🤣🤣🤣
In this video, cody has been doing things we’ve all only could’ve tried in games like Forza or The Crew
Legit best vid on youtube
That was great 👍 what a car !  Impressed with the hill climb and that bubble company just got the best ad ever !
I had several panic attacks watching this, thank you 😬😂
From all them cars you drove it made you a good  driver
Its crazy how he drives and crashes less than richard hammond
Look at this dude😂
I needed this awesome video today. Ferrari has a huge stick up their rear. You threw everything at it, but the kitchen sink. Now throw a kitchen sink at it.
If it’s red, it’s ded.
Bro is playing GTA 5
Crazy dude
Sad reality there is out there with no car and motorcyle like me
I love your channel but as a car enthusiast, it's a mixed bag of emotions ranging from laughter to anger and sadness. 🙂🙃  That said, I understand the business aspect of it since making money on YouTube now requires bigger investments and crazier stunts.
Bow did you get them to sell that to you
My fave vid so far, laughed hardest when "Guve me a hammer" =tool war This man is a legend.  Ferrari's stock prices just went up cuz of u.
Man. The ending. I only saw that on cartoons 🤣🤣🤣 sick
The most honest car review channels by far...
I want one.
That sounds beautiful 😊
funny, when i saw a comment on your instagram that said "he´s not gonna destroy it, he´s grown past that point" well how did it go?
Ferrari watching this video with their lawyers right now lol
When the Ferrari seen the Mercedes it questioned how long it’s existence will be with its new owner.
This is when Foza becomes a Reality. Awesome video 👍👍
13:20 Bro has so much random stuff 🤣 love ur videos man keep up the hilarious content
I wish I could like this multiple times 😂😂❤
Just curious to know your income source bro !
Fun video!
That’s a vehicle abuse
He just gave the company who made tgat bubble the best product test review
Bugatti watching the video 😦
Not every day you see a Ferrari drifting and being a rally car whistlin you are very creative
Bros playing Forza in real life
😂😂😂😂
Just saying Bam did all of this first.  🤷‍♂️
Painful and entertaining.  Hard to watch but I cannot stop.
When you play Forza in real life
Dude are probably getting sued
The screams when he threw the ladders 😂😂😂😂😂 the gunshot sounds at the bubble 😭😭😭I was weak the whole time
This was much needed! As much as I hate this guy but I really loved to see that Ferrari trashed! Absolute joy!
I wonder if you can pull something heavy with that hole in the front?
This hurt to watch
Cody I gotta tell you, you’re a pretty good driver no matter how much people hate
Thank you, I'll try and find one of those csr covers for my grandmothers SN95
This video is sponsored by Car Condoms...
OMG dude.. WTF? I’m laughing but I think I wanna cry. 😳 The anxiety I’m experiencing watching this is palpable.. lol
bro why at 6:00 did this man look like the buffalo shooter
Freaking wild 😂😂
Remake the tax the rich videos now
Top G 😂😂 what a legend, thats the only way to spend money and have fun with it
This car has more suspension travel than my car hahahah
It's like I'm watching an old video from tax the rich YouTube Chanel
Will that bubble protect it from a flood? 🤔🤣
Literally best video yet!
Ferrari whaching this🤣🤣🤣
Ops ! I think you really wanna smach it😥
i'm actually surprised about its offroading capabilities. I'm impressed! Thanks for testing out.
I almost can’t watch this…almost 😢
Hahaha great video
How is it staying so clean 😂
absolutely love how he’s not babying the car like all the typical old guys who owns Ferraris. the thought of them fuming and foaming at the mouths watching cody drive the shit out of this on the dirt roads brings massive joy to my heart 🥲🥲
Gotta paint it pink next, I heard Ferrari loves that 😁
if ferrari sues they wouldn't make a dent in his wallet lol.
He’s doing what we all do in forza but has the money to do it in irl
Bro... Ferrari is gonna ban you
Чудесно, я не могу позволить себе Тойоту хачироку, даже банку сгущенки, а тут одна фара машинки стоит как моя жизнь...
I mean, its not even lile the g wagon video. But this hurts so much, even when im too far of buying a 3k BIKE.
I love it🫶🏼😂
ferrari wont ever sell u another one
No no please don’t, if your going to distroy car distroy a cheaper car
Coolest/most ridicules video I’ve watched in a while.
Love you 🤣
ok, you need to get a bunch of people inside the bubble and throw heavy things at them.
What color is your Bugatti
Quick question so if I work so much to get $400k on a car alone can they really sue me for modifying a $400k I bought with my own money
Ferrari nesse momento 🤡
GTA in real life
*add to the black list Ferrari *
Throwing shit at the end was so good wtf.  how did you guys manage that tho? can we get some bts
This is educational and exactly the kind of information i needed before deciding on which Ferrari to buy.
Let’s be honest, if we had the money, we’d all shred a super car off road 😂
This earth would be much better place without you on it, idiot.
That car bubble held up better than I bet most would think 🤣
I wanna see bro go mudding in a lifted Bugatti
$4k rusted out truck... NO!!!!  $400k Ferrari, I cant wait to see how bad this thing gets destroyed!
Last 60 seconds is the most I've laughed at a YouTube video
Quality content as always. Can't wait for the future videos 🫡🇺🇲
Pure happiness
Cill
I paused a movie and made everyone watch this video the second I knew it came out.  good work Cody and TEAM
Such an emotional rollercoaster. Only the best videos can pull that off !
That bubble garage thingy sale after this: 📈
It’s like Forza Horizon in real life 🤣
7:13 pov: me going to my castle in forza horizon 5
8:36 best laugh ever
Love it, followed u on insta too! Can’t wait for Bugatti
This is so painful to watch. Alot of people have put so much work for that work of art and for you to do that is mad and stupid to be honest. Learn to appreciate all the hardwork Ferrari have put through. Money is not everything sir
He should do it like Speed Zone did and skip the car across the pond.
This guy is the definition of every immature, fun, man who literally has intrusive thoughts and does them. bloody legend!
🤣🤣🤣🤣
How did no one see the Lamborghini cover on the Ferrari at the first 50 seconds of the video 😂😂 mind blowing
Fu×€ing love this guy
This is the best video I've seen for a while. Will the bubble withstand a slight nudge with 50 cal?
WHAT ARE YOE DOWING🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
Didn't expect a cameo from Doug
So many triggers!
This might be the best Ferrari video on Youtube!. A offroad converstion would be sick!!!.
YouTube King 👑 💯
hazzard dukes ferrari
hazzard dukes ferrari
hazzard dukes ferrari
hazzard dukes ferrari
This wasn't a true durability test Cody... We demand more!!!
hazzard dukes ferrari
hazzard dukes ferrari
hazzard dukes ferrari
Why the long wait
You could have just titled the video “I bought a $400,000 ferrari” and we all could have guessed the just to destroy it part
Fu*kin Love your Style Cody you up the Ante every time X10
the last 40 seconds of this video had my laughing my ass off they literally threw soo many things i was laughing so hard XD 🤣🤣🤣
I've never laughed so hard before 😂😂😂
I don't even take my 2500 dollar Mustang on gravel roads, but it looks like a hell of a lot of fun to go beat on it like that.
Forza irl
you should lift it and put it on boggers
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
America is a failed society
Did you really pressure wash the interior
Whe  you thougt you had seen it al.......and then there is Cody 🤣
Fearrari is gona steal copy claim for this as an their ad :D
You not destroy the car? I don't see your car damage, fender, broke window other ect .go back to school and *"learn how to destroy."  this video Make no sense. Change your title to"(I'm ride my $400,000 car on the mountain.") LoL  LOSER
And here I was worried you were going to hit the Hilux
Bro just doesn’t stop, what’s next? Lol 😂
Looks like an RC car in the dirt 😂
Just because you can doesn't mean you should.  You wanna make a great video? I will sell you my left nut for $400,000. Js
Cel mai tare youtuber
Basically an advertisement for the car bubble!, i got to go to work ! Until next time!
Pre bun
Love the content but man you are a complete douche.
Where do I buy the car protector balloon?
He really went from destroying 20-30k trucks to 300-600k hyper cars. Good for him
you're an absolute menace fr💀💀
Surprised it didn't just automatically come with a cease and desist letter when he bought it 😂
At least only 20 precent of his face has scars,  you need that ferrari and the cash from YouTube!  ,.....you see how that works?
Good job this needed to be done
I have anxiety after this
Once again, you not only show a complete lack of understanding of the Ferrari cease and desist situations but also an entire video of gaslighting the topic. You’re a $&@%’ing moron and you pander to ignorant cucks
This guy living my dreamlife lol Love it!
A big middle finger to the big powers, I love it!
Dont like this Video you are stupid
Legend
not sure if ferrari will want him to buy anymore cars after this
This mans out here playing forza horizon 5 in real life
The only thing i dont like is that he never really lets his friends join in , yea he lets his crew , pick up dirty condoms and embarrasses them at every turn and he is the star, im just saying,  you guys are his little bicth!... you see how that works!!
the ending is the perfect ad for the inflatable bubble 😂
nice video dude 🧡😊
Real Life Forza lmaooo forreal
Slowly warming up to the Bugatti i see 👀
You need to get a razor rsf650 and upgrade it, It can go 80mph and its also red might be fun.
Bei just playing Forza Horizon irl
someone needed to finally do something about ferrari. glad it was you 💯
Gives @TaxTheRich100 energy 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Aw dude, diesel swap it please
He playing GTA for real
Gotta be the most funny thing to do😂 i would love driving that thing off Road😆
This just convinced me to buy a Ferrari now 😂
LMAO that ending. That is a worthy sponsor contender for those car johns.
Then send a cease and desist to Ferrari 😈
Make it into a donk
Why does this remind me so much of playing GTA 5....
Throwing things at the bubble ending was hilarious!!!!!! Laughing so hard I was crying!!!
As a Marine,  dude this guy is a joke , please dont get worked up , the whole gaslight thing i told he dose but you give him that power , ill be your life coach people,  DM me!
How can they sue if they bought the car😅
Doug (THISSSS!)
Ferrari is the Karen of cars
Hearing that car off the side of the mountain must of had people thinking Bigfoot was out
but 50 inch rims on that bit
🔥🔥🔥
Ferrari dosent care about you! This guy has made money off gas lighting,  ...stupid people!
#team Wendy
Who cares about the Ferrari, i am impress about how well is doing the bubble , that i actually need one for my Geo Metro....
This shit reminds me of TaxTheRich Channel. Nuts
To be honest, the bubble company shoud pay you! That is some great marketing right there!
Damn, that thing sounded absolutely amazing. Lol rip.
I agree do what you want but how dose attention seeking behavior get you views its interesting to watch but how old are people that like to think this is really cool to do , im so confused,  and i could give a shit less what you do! Nobody cares , but when i was 16 i would love this rolling on the floor drawing dicks on emblems!  Hilarious
I WAS WAITING FOR THIS 😃
we definitely need part 2
Enfim consegui ver alguém no mundo usando uma Ferrari.... parabéns
is it just for me ? bc he looks very orange for some reason in the videos
Damn, the Ferrari rally team is crazy!
Sick car broo!!!! But what’s in all those military style containers 😮😮😮
This video will be one of his biggest.  Love this content Cody! Laughed incredibly hard at this video
Cease And Desist Letter in transit. Please hold...
bro, you're going to get 2 cease and desists: from Ferrari for using a Lambo dust cover AND from Lambo for covering a Ferrari with their dust cover
I'm glad the Ferrari is still intact. I love this car.
10/10 my guy put a big investment in the company that makes those bubbles
Legendary
Enjoy life and the sick cars
I mill in 10 hour's. Definitely getting sued
Nice fuck european cars 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
This is the best 😂😂😂
Words cannot express how much joy i got from watching you just brutalise that Ferrari in such comedic fashion.  Well done Cody you sir are a true bloody legend
Best video ever
Not broken enough
this is golden.. 🤌🏽
Jump it
That was sick as f×÷K..I need to get rich and go f×÷k about with the diesel man:)))
I'm Italian, i'm a ferrari Fan and I wnt you to beat the sh*t out of it! truly difficult to see innovative content nowaday!
I need one of these bubbles now.
ATP tell this man get me ah hellcat widebody 😂
Give me a hammer 🤣🤣😂
DE DURABILITY TEST ON THE NEWEST BMW M5 CS
The first word for me is garbage. They love hating on their buyers.   If it's not Kawasaki or a Toyota sera it's not worth it lol.
GTA in real Life haha
Love it.......awesome content just b careful bud haha
this shit had me laughing the whole time
The ending though 😅
This dude is spending more money on videos than Mr. Beast sheesh
You’ll probably just get banned from buying ever again
What. The
Lamborghini Huracán Evo cover on the Ferrari 🤣
Am I the only one who saw the porches behind him 1:30
You’re a G
Nice car! Sounds great!! Looks pretty good. Made it through 10 mins.. impressively
i enjoyed every second of this lawsuit
This video is pure entertainment😂😂😂
You car it with the excavator
Ceased and desist
You made me a believer in the g wagon maybe Ferrari will see it that way but I doubt it 😂
He didn't destroy it
I'm laughing and crying at the same time on the inside
everybody gangsta till he gets sued
The videos just keep getting better and better 😂 also thank you for never click baiting
Cody…….🤦‍♂️. Please PLEASE, for the love of god… please tell me you at least PPF’d the thing….  Cuz if not, I work at a ceramic pro dealer in southwest Ohio and we’d be happy to take care of that for you!!!🫶🏼
That last part randomly yeeting stuff at the bubble almost killed me 🤣
The fact that Ferrari has any say in what you do to your car after you buy it is absolutely absurd and its sad that they still exist
This was beauty!!
cannot believe I just watched that happen lol
I like squatted trucks ❤
Getting a custom exhaust kit on your ferrari should be allowed, like man it sounds amazing🔥
Tank tracks on it next?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Who else was expecting the kitchen sink to be thrown in lol
Excellent grazier
Nice to see he’s letting that horse back out in the wild where it belongs:)
I think we need a door durability test to see it the door is stronger than the hilux
Jeremy Clarkson is impressed
Welcome to forza horizon Cody edition
Oh wow that’s a cool fast sports car
😂
I can't imagine the the ceo of Ferrari thinks about this
Whole video was crazy but black marker dick on the horse , Enzo spinning in his grave 😮
Jeremy Clarskson would be so proud!
Was this before or after Street Speed 717 jumped the vette. Love the content though!!!
F
13:00 Sounds like a Spike Jones concert! 😬
"I can't believe you've done this.."
Literally GTA in real life.
Man is playing Forza IRL
Love u dude 👍
You need to destroy a MK4 Supra
this is the best. the car bubble stint was awesome!, but TBH, you should of thrown the kitchen sink at it just to prove a point.
send it to me in Pakistan, it will be wrecked only by the speedbumps.
I'm 51 years of age, and I am pissing myself with laughter here!!!!! Absolutely love it, keep them coming young man, for as we say here in Ireland, you're a bleeding legend! 🤣🤣
Pov: Doing a time trial in gta 5 with a sports car be like...

Mans is just playing Forza at this point

Congrats on the Ferrari, i remember when it was just the one white durtymax
He went from whistlindiesel to honkingasoline
Bruh I love this guy😂😂😂😂
Fuck Ferrari. Kill that thing.
He was even scared of getting sued. It still looks new
Another great buy Cody well done
Lmaooo the ending scene was glorious
First word to mind, SMASH!!!!!
Ferrari right now 🫣
Dude, how many people did you have throwing stuff in the end!? That cracked me up 😂😂
Destroy it  😊
I absolutely hated every bit about youu destroying such a nice car. But I gotta give credit where credit's due... THIS MAN CAN DRIVE
deserves all the views it gets, one of a kind video, good job!
And this is the last they sell you one 😂
President Biden will put an end to your shenanigans.  Your antics is contributing to global warming and Russian misinformation.  Biden will rid the USA of covid on 1 may  2023.
Really good bubble ad
Never laughed so much in my life 😂
yo, this is another crazy video
1 lady owner from new
absolute banger
Kinda looks like you're babying the car. I mean you didn't even jump it.
“Gimme a hammer” shit that made me laugh
that was a detailing car video not a destruction video
I wonder how well that will hold up compared to a Lamborghini tractor.
My man!!!
Best video ever seeing you drift this beautiful red car up the gravel track and hill climb it amazing every kid wants to see videos like this. Using it like everyone's inner child wants it to be used  YES. You need to set a rally cross coarse and invite mark mccann 64 over :-)
can you give me a car
Ur crassy lol good for YouTube that u destroy that thing
Best content in a while guy, keep up the good work
I’ve been waiting too long for this great job Cody

No jumps?

Ferrari rally car
gg rari boyz
That bubble is the first thing to survive WD
Protective bubble sales just went up 100% 😂😂
What money can't buy.....a functioning brain🤦🏻
This, without a doubt, is the best test of a two wheel drive car I've seen in a while. Also, the bubble was impressive. I approve of this video.
if it isnt already destroyed you should go to a mcdonalds and park it on a curb like jeep owners
Best content on youtube by far.
who has more fun than than Cody
Whistlin diesel is a true American hero. Even with all of the success he's had, he never forgets where he came from. 👏
This guys playing Forza Horizon in real life
I was hoping there'd be a kitchen sink at the end..
Ferrari are lucky to have you as a customer.
Great marketing for Ferrari. Durable as fuck let's be real
You're crazy 😂😂😂😂
Tbh I don't believe Ferrari is gunna be mad if anything they sold the car knowing it was gunna be destroyed but they wanted to prove it was tough. And not a peice of glass
they threw everything at it but the kitchen sink!
found myself liking the video before the video even started lol, love you WD!
this is the most gental it gets
now this, this one. this one hurt.

Shoulda tried an anvil on the bubble
I love it how people can barely afford a house meanwhile this man is wrecking a $400k car

All the junk flying into that bubble at the end was the best thing I’ve ever seen
I really learned a lot from this video. Very educational!

Destroy some Teslas or other's EV Shit Boxes
You really sold that car bubble pretty well
I just can’t get enough of you destroying my dreams
And Today is Ferrari Enzos birthday. I feel like this is the best cherry on top ever... Straight savage.
Even Andrew Tate can't do that
anyone along the east coast should be looking into buying one of these for hurricane season
Me in forza
There was a little hate in that first hammer throw 😂
Honestly I'm very impressed how good the Ferrari is performing off road 😅. Definitely didn't expect that
this shit is so durable.
Dude messing with the rarri
God I love you. Your content it next level.
This is gold ! I recommend tire chains though
ну хоть кто то по назначению использует спорт машину
4:40 that's gold hahahaha his face
It needs 13 inch Rims and a diesel engine from China 🎉
Wait for the video clip in which you start searching for the religion of Islam 😀🔥 Like Andrew Tate
Ferrari can make a good rally car
dude's playing Forza IRL
clickbait >:(  i wanted to see it actually get destroyed
This was worth the wait!
Man, this Forza Horizon gameplay is great! 😂
This is why Ferrari doesn't need advertising.
Ferraris first time entering WRC World Redneck Championships
Ferrari durability test next video I can feel it in my bones
I love and hate this at the same time. Keep up the good work.
Bro, this is me in Forza 5
People wasting money = good  People using their money to help others that maybe could change their life forever = bad  Gen z in a nutshell 🗿
Enzo had a stroke when he seen this😊
Also the camera work is literally the cinematic camera from GTAV
they need to pay you to use this in a comercial for that bubble
Ferrari most wanted
Bro doesn’t just have the car money, he’s got the gear money. Dude is rocking UFPRO uniform and a fucking team Wendy exfil ballistic helmet with ballistic face cover just for this. Literal chad
Donate the car to me 😢 it’s my dream car and I don’t have one
Donate the car to me 😢 it’s my dream car and I don’t have one
Ferrari actually sold u this no way I thought they only sell to previous owners ?
That thing looks well built, i bet it can tow a 10 000 pounds trailer with a bob cat in it
😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Coady your such a legend ! Whistlindiesel for president
Love u bro stay  crazy and osm love u take care also
Hey Diesel can you make a video about those dumb looking donk cars. That would be awesome.
please squatted that ferrari
You will go to jail !
Best ad for that bubble EVER 😂
can you just buy me a car? 🤣
i think this video will be dead, you disrecpected the car and Ferari is gonna get mad
The random edits with memes popping up are mad funny. Love the content, g
Cody is hording guns or those crates
Does this guy still have those haters 😂 who could not like him. Hilarious to ☠️
great video
epic!  Ya know, i cant lie, that bubble impressed me.
That last scene is just crazy 😂.
Thanks for the best video on youtube as always :D I'm smiling :)
@Ferrari
reach a settlement NOW! before the visit.🤔
pls dont destroy it give it to me I will times it twice
This is throwing off “Oxi Clean” vibes
That was crap. I was expecting total destruction! 😔
This is why people hate rich People.
dude you just made my day!🤣😂
Soon as I seen the thumbnail I thought. If it’s red, it’s dead
Let me come and we can do a test on my c6
lmao love it
@ferrari
He’s playing gta irl
ayo homie i could use some money if you dont know what to do with it
I think the raptor R is next
10/10
wheres the real man here, no dick.
Is this supposed to be funny? At least take the effort of washing your greasy face if you're gonna make us watch it for 14 minutes of our lives we'll never get back. Trash content
That ending was the perfect length 😂
This makes me want a Ferrari, offroads like a f350😂
To the people in Cody's instagram comment section who thought he wasn't gonna destroy the f8
Imagine a world where this video title isn't clickbait. Wow!
Nice car! Now trash it!
i think YOU should sue Ferrari for making such a durable off-road vehicle
Mad respect for Cody for not giving a DAMN about resale values. That topic is the worst thing about cars especially if it’s becoming more and more expensive and catering to super rich people. I wonder how Ferrari fans and the super wealthy owners feel about this. I bet they are gonna cry about the rEsAlE vAlUe 😂
If u don't want it plz give it to me
The ending was gr8. About time to sub :D
1 million views in 11 hours 😳 congratulations with that!   Please update us on what Ferrari has to say after this video 🤣
And I'm worried for a 1k maintenance on my lexus
People commenting acting like they have 5 Ferraris…
This man is playing GTA online IRL
❤❤❤❤❤

:) Give me the hammer  Open ups the full inventory 💀
A sports car tested for durability.. never thought I would see this day
Bro is the new taxtheRich
lets wait for the mafia to get him xD
Can't get enough of the zero f's mentality. Keep it up
I remember seeing the post notification for the video where you took Monstermax before it was Monstermax and drove it without lug nuts, crazy seeing where the channel is at and I'll forever watch every upload.
I like.
I mean Ferraris r a hunk of junk any way
Your balls need a durability test at this point. There rock solid.
EPIC SHIT)
I haven’t been so cofused in my whole entire life, felt like laughing hysterically and crying at the same time
This is me playing gta in real life. This dudes a legend! That car surprised the hell out of me. Black cummins didn't make 1/10 of this
That was epic 😂
This is great!! But, you forgot the kitchen sink! 😂😂
Also I'd totally love to see behind the scenes clips of how some videos are made.
Forza horizon in real life
You should let me have your g wagon
I Hope the guy that hand built this Ferrari never sees that video he might be depressed after seeing it 😭😭💀
Reminds me of How to basic
I heard you wanted to give me your G wagon
I love it that he actually makes sure he doesn't really break his car, he found the the  perfect line
The last bit sounded like the beginning of a pink floyd song 😂
Great Video. They say that the most reliable vehicle in the world is a  Toyota Sequoia from 2004-2023. would love to see a test video on one of those lol. Kwwp up the Awesome Videos
Still waiting for the Mk.4 Supra durability test
meanwhile most people would be happy if they could afford a 200k house in their life....
I can taste the ferrari owner tears from here lol
your a total C U Next Tuesday
what is in all them cases in the garage?
Can’t fix stupid
Man’s playing forza in real life 😂🔥
I seriously have not laughed like this is a while. I am so sick of the fake status symbols that make everyone act as if they have to conform to an unspoken standard. YOU ARE THE EQUALIZER and I appreciate you 😂😂😂
The conclusion is the horse is a strong car
Ls swap it lmao
Loved the part at the end where you emptied an entire toolbox on the car 🤣
Should have filled digger bucket up and tip out as far up as the arm will go and tip onto the thing
I haven’t recovered from the g wagon honestly.
Duuuuuuuuuude! Are you for reallllllllll 😂
Yes I freaking knew these were pretty strong have always loved Ferrari over lambo could never afford one of either so thanks for doing the durability test for us lol and Ferrari should being paying you for advertisement lol 😂
what a retard. you waste money for fun. donate to a hospital or do somethng good with your money dumbass
Congratulations 1 million views in 11 hours
Outstanding. ❤
Man i like your videos😅🎉
Quality over quantity! Once again, a🔥🔥🔥🔥 video!!!

Simply Epic!
Who thinks FERRARI will take legal action?
Found myself smiling the whole time. Top video! Who thinks FERRARI will take legal action?
i kinda want to see how good of a driver he actually is. Like drifting and rallye racing. i think he would be pretty decent
Throw a vice from the second floor into the car
@matamostrong
Forza Horizon would be proud!
Love it
4:40 holy shit, actual lol.
13:17 When Scalpers buy all RTX Cards and XT Cards.
Bro, this just sounds illegal to destroy a $400,000 worth car😂
When everything started flying 😂 hilarious
The best vid on the internet rn
And I’m sitting here putting my Jetta away during winter
I love this channel, only if more people on YT would do what you are doing, best reviews on YT, best durability test, 100% honestly, buy a Ferrari to look at it in your glass garage? No way baby, it’s a work horse it needs to pay itself, you are sensational, unique and crazy bro, so let me ask you this: what the baby would look like between this Ferrari and your tank? 🤔
Some eat dogshit to get famous. Some destroy cars to get famous. And boys, i love it!! Keep on destroying!! Love from Sweden.
LoL
when there are millions of people in ur town/country dying everyday from poverty,being homeless and havent eaten in days,and this "Clown" buys a 400k car to wreck and show everyone how much more of an idiot he is... i mean hey,i enjoy some of ur content,but when u buy these exotics just to make a vid to show how u dont give f=ck .... thats the PITTS for me.... send some money my way and i will show what i can do with it to make a Global change.... thats all just a F8ck Boy mentality.... Do ya part homie.... #WhistlinDieselDeezNutz .... Get at me!!!!

Justin is fuming right now.
Pleas  crach this on the three like a scuola bus !!😂
This is the right way to really enjoy a car. If it is a super car, yeah now is the time to show it.
Can't beleive this is the Cody who used to run a normal truck through a pond in his farm to this. Absloutly love it.
Can these cars he buy be used for tax write offs for business purposes
I'm here for the comment section
11:46 the cat in the hood vent reminds me of THE tiktok where real cat sleep in the vent
Wonder how many people noticed the lambo cover... Lol....
4:38 why would you hit that beautiful r8 :((( i am so sad for it
There are so stupid.
This feels to uncomfortable
You Are Crazy I Wish I Could Do Videos Like This
More please and less GTRs 🤣
Forza horizon IRL
Ed Bolian rubbing his hands together.

DDE meet the Ferrari slayer
I guess Ferrari made their Vehicles for multi purpose, on road, off road, etc. I really enjoyed this video.
🤣🤣 Bro, the content is amazing. I'm crying 😂
Why Do you hate Porsche??? To a crash test on a GT3rs
WAIT, YOU WATCH GARBAGE TIME??, ((Garbage time collab would amazing and funny))
Ferrari is currently drafting their cease and desist letter 🤣🤣

Doesnt whistlen diesel have a tank? Ohh no lol
Dude lift it a little and put on some offroad tires, then take it offroading like the Toyota Hilux :D

Forza horizon in real life
Classic WD shenanigans. Tits/10
🔥💕👍
Was this influenced from that instagram reel that was making jokes about you driving a ferrari in a forest 😂😂😂
you suck the bumper didnt even fall off your lame
I really don’t think I have ever seen such a good video
Cease and desist speedrun
He basically gave free sponsorship for the car bubble they better start paying him
please in behalf of colorblinds, make this car good for any color blind can see. Remove all the paint.
Nice Icon FJ.
Now give it to a subscriber
That ending 🤣
Ferrari should actually be paying you for that wicked asss commercial you just did for them haha
Kinda like real forza 😂
my boi turned the ferrari into a rally car
the pain inside me rn 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Put some C3 corvette wheels and a huge spoiler on it
Это прекрасно 😁😅
He's just driving like he's in a video game guys Jesus don't be so mad 😂😂😂😂
I get what this channel is about but I can't help but feel sad about the pointlessness of destroying a car like this. Donate it it to a charity or something.
the best video ever
Dude I can’t believe this is reall. Smiled the whole video. Love the work lmaooo.
This is probably the first time I have actually cringed while watching you do stuff to your cars. That was an amazing video
This is great 🤣
I'm so happy right now lmao
How could you hate on a man showing off how durable these cars are, it’s just the company that isn’t durable if yk what I’m sayin 😂
Any lawsuit yet?
Me in forza. Love the video man
Hi, this is ferrari. Youre under arrest
If you decide to sell it, I'm sure Ed Bolian would still buy it 😂
Poor car didn't know if it's red it's dead
you make me happy @whistlindiesel
Im died at 13:24
Taxtherich vibes
This is the proper way a car should be driven just have as much fun as possible
I would like to work for you, there is any way? I am from Poland. At first i was thinking this is wrong what you doing but now i want to do the same as you but in Poland but in my way. You showing the truth about mind poverty of some people heads. How to start?
Perfect content!
Cody and crew have the best videos. I utilize the information from the videos to make informed decisions on what vehicles I will purchase
This hurts the heart more than any video before
Red is dead lol
How could they sue you if you bought it and got the title? Wouldn’t it be your property to do whatever you want with it?
😍😍
Where does all this money come from?
cost in damage? maybe $1000
That was worth the wait! - can’t see them being all law suity about it… I think it held up pretty good for an Italian surrender monkey
Lmao i love this guy
I am lovin Your videos ! Please don’t stop  Best regards from Berlin. If you ever want to come to Germany your more than welcome! We’ll hit the autobahn and drive as fast as you like…. Legally!! Keep up the good testing 😂
Your drifting is getting better lol
think he’s going to get a letter
They make bubbles like that where you have to drive into them. If you back the car in the exhaust will kill you before you can get out of the bubble. So remember don’t back your car in.
Yeeeeeeeeessss, ferrari will be pissed
Ferrari lawsuit SPEEDRUN
Had a short childhood ?
From ANYLEVEL to ANOTHER LEVEL
Hey man that's a cool red sports car
This is actually a pretty good commercial for Ferrari.
Total blasphemy.
This is the definition of “Made it”
fuck how many people were throwing things at the end 🤣
Ferrari rally car, wow.
HAHAHAHHAHA!!!lOVING IT
Part 2 where u really test (destroy) it please!
Remeber when they said he cant drive
First time viewer. This video is an instant classic. What a treat to find quality channel. I applied for a Ferrari Internship, I think they will dismiss my application because I liked this video.
That hole in the hood is a grease fitting!
Waiting for part 2
TaxTheRich100 did it better
Turn this into a rally car
That bubble knew that if it didn't protect the Ferrari  Ferrari will sue it
Definitely a lawsuit 😂
Bro living real life forza horizon
I’m so happy u did this anyone that would spend this much money on a car is an idiot keep up the great videos
If they ask, this is gta
its a V8 can't really call it a Ferrari
I’ve never been bothered by any of the tests Cody does but this one is a little hard to watch
Everyone is talking about the Ferrari.. I wanna know what's in the military crates 🤣🤣
Do something with the supra 4:20
best rally!
The fact he brought the punisher into this made it legend.
I think one of the options on this Ferrari was all terrain tires 😂
The fact that he actually didnt destroy it
Great show 👏.  Shit, DDE doesn't even come close to your content driving exotic cars. Keep it up man. That big bubble cover for the f8 is a good product. Even after the whistlen diesel tests
I don't want to know what Ferrari will do to you.
Great ending
I always wanted offroading super cars So here we go ❤️
Ppf it  😂
I’m glad we got to watch this before Ferrari gets offended!! 😂😂😂
Cody, thank you. Just... thank you. 😆
I'm getting Tax the Rich vibes
Ultra hectic,love it.
I ❤ it
This hurts my soul
Excellent
So like since you got money like that and I’m a brokie you tryna get me a charger srt?😂😂😂😵loved the video was entertaining even tho I was cringing till the end lol😂😂
That Bentley in the back tho 👀
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
THIS©
I think it needs some 40” boggers and wheel wells cut out to fit them
Yo you stupid yo!!!😆😆
You guys definitly need to test drive the new rally Lambo ( The Lamborghini Sterrato)!
That Ferrrrri: Yes, at last, I lost my virginity...
1 million views in 10 hours what a legend 🔥🔥😍😍
That’s one spicy meat-a-ball. Good to see you have skills to control the vehicle. You should give Rob Dahm some driving lessons then he might be able to win a race or some decent sends like you ya mad dog
capisco perchè Ferrari nega la possibilità di acquisto delle loro auto a certi personaggi.....
1 mil views in 10 hours? Is that a record?
An im a disabled veteran who has a limited income and needs 10k to start a small business but I can't get a loan because..  I'm disabled and have limited income and grants from the government want me to rent a brick and mortar store front.   The irony. He's an all American hero destroying a car while a veteran suffers. Nice.
Giggled the entire video...👌great one
Make it a rally car
Yep. Cody is definitely getting sued by Ferrari too. Also it kinda hurts for me to see these videos as a car guy but honestly, Ferrari deserves this.
painful to watch this
You are so damn creative Cody! 😂😂
Ferrari be like: damn, our cars can do that?😯
People cant afford eggs, and you buy a 400k Ferrari? A-Hole!
Yoooo can I have that Ferrari air compressor? I’ll love you long time LOL
how the fuck do you make money ? XDDD
irl gta lol
I love it cody. As much as it's cringe to watch we know what you do and come here for just that. I can't wait for part 2 or3
I have a feeling that bubble is going to survive longer than that pos Ferrari.
0:01 cheeseburger
The end had me in stitches!!!
So why did Ferrari make a rally car?  Seriously the coolest thing I've seen! 🤩
Here for the comments 😂
KNIGHT RIDER 2000 BRO! 😏

Hey Whistlin, the hair transplant is coming in great! I bet in 3 or 4 months you will ditch the hats completely
This is why Cody is a True Legendary Tuber

WD is the G.O.A.T. 🇺🇸☣️🏁
This is what humanity needs!   Keep doing this. 👌👌🙌
Best part about a Cease and Desist is that you have to “wait for the mail” to arrive. Make sure you don’t hit your mail box with that F8 on accident…..
“I destroyed a 400,000$ Ferrari”  *Does maybe 3-4 scratches worth of damage to it, literally nothing like the preemptive pictures has us imagining, all while doing a total of 30-40 seconds of donuts and drifting in a montage*
Jump it
Bro what
Very cool to see a Ferrari do what its not supolposed to do. Good clean driving, that drift at 10:00😍
Bro is playing forza in real life
This is how GTA Online players be like. Be sure to call Lester after this.
how long til ferrari pt 2 lol
This is awesome. Put some ultra wide wheels on it.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🇺🇲💪
i wana by a firrari now
Let us know how much the car bubble company is gonna give you for permission to use this as an ad lmao
I watched this video on the toilet bc my tummy is hurting . A+ ending
i think the best part about this whole thing is imagining the ferrari exects just FROTHING at the mouth the whole time. Ohh what i would not give to see those pompus wankers.
The fact that I watched the whole video and was genuinely surprised when it ended is hilarious.. never been so invested in my life
Das ist GEIL!
It hurts to see thos but at the same time im enjoing it..😳🤭🤭🤭
Feels like I am watching a normal gta5 gameplay
brooo
Bad move. Great social experiment.
💯
Can you send me the steering wheel after you finish destroying it?
That ending was awesome!
bro where is the duribility test of g wagon brooo. i appreciate ur work bro. big fan
1:35 the Porsche 911’s 👀
PORCODIO SESEEESEEESEEESEE
Amish wagon wheels would be the go😏
I'm getting a heart attack
Feeling let down there was plenty of room for a kitchen sink to be thrown there . But funny as hell all the way .
Most epic video ending like fucking EVER!!!!! now i can go to see doctor because my belly riped from laughing.
Now what  Wasting fiji water
Pretty sure this handled off road better than the ridgeline      , awesome video 👍
I never had a car in my life and now I'm watching your videos, I think you're a fool!  If I had a car, I would take care of it and appreciate it.  you're an idiot.
Well, no kitchen sink was thrown at it.....
better then the stupid videos of shoe testing... done over and over and over
LoL 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wow you are strange, why the hell do you do this? Shame....
Most insane car video on the internet. @ENZO your next
Lemme put the engine in my 93 f150 once ur done with it 👍
Poor Ferrari😂
Me in Forza horizon
5:55 Ngl, that was a sick move right there.
Do Lamborghini next😂
BROS LITERALLY PLAYING FORZA I LOVE IT!!
Cannot wait to see how Ferrari responds lol, hard to watch as a supercar enthusiast but I respect the content and your personal purchases. Interesting 😂
Bro never fails to disappoint keep grinding💪
but can they actually sue you? after you paid for it?
Omg new video
content right here
You forgot the kitchen sink 🤦‍♂️😂🤣
yoo Ferrari's company is going to send mercenaries on you
i wonder if he owns anything he actually goes i want to keep nice lol
I will eat your Dog
I can normally laugh at these videos. But this one hurt
I love it.
Everyone give this man a like and/or share because this is gonna be a hit to this man soon
that was sweet
Why do so many ppl like seeing a Ferrari get messed up? I don’t get it. How is this funny?
Im just gonna be that guy. Instead of making these stupid videos you should be taking that 400K and putting it ALL into BTC. See thats what guys like me are doing and thats why im going to have lots, lots more money than you in a couple of years...and guess what, i'll have a bunch of cars like this and they will be sitting pretty in my garage not getting destroyed.
this is dedication.
that ending was incredibly good advertising
I’ve been waiting for this for what seems like an eternity 🙌
Give me $10000 to concern my dream and do like you
12:00 Wow a physical ceast and desists
Couldn’t afford the 812 super fast I see
God I’m so proud to be a true WD fan 🤘💯
POV, you trespassed on Gma's Oil Lot
I was laughing so hard at the end when y’all were throwing crap at it
It's funny to me how many misconceptions there are about Ferrari. I mean, a bunch of people on TikTok who never could afford a Ferrari are malding about the fact that Ferrari is going against people who put a bad light on their brand. Let me tell you the actual truth about Ferrari as someone who has traded with Ferraris for 15 years. First of all, the only lawsuits people have had with Ferrari have been with people who manipulated the Ferrari logo, many brands do so, especially if people change the logo to make fun of the brand or discredit them.  Furthermore, there has never been a lawsuit because someone replaced parts themselves, did some tuning, or put in some Chinese parts to change the look of their Ferrari. All they do is put you on a blacklist, meaning they won't sell you a Ferrari anymore. What's so wrong with a brand deciding not to sell their car to everyone? I mean, there are so many people waiting in line to get a Ferrari, why should they care about a meaningless person on TikTok who does clickbait and spreads false informations?  Just so you know, many car brands have a blacklist. They are just not so open about it. Bugatti, Ferrari, Lamborghini, especially Rolls Royce, hell even Mercedes won't sell to everyone if a person has been noticed multiple times in a negative way. So why are people so mad about that? Even I am on their blacklist because I am a known reseller. Do I care? No.  Actually there should be a blacklist for almost every company. That would give them legal rights to go against resellers who are abusing bots such as Nike or GPU manufacturers, thats what you all want, right?
this guy be playing forza horizon irl
Love to see this😁😁
When you realise that he's the new @taxtherich100
Fantastic😂👌🏾
This video makes me sad.
Bro My heart went out my body at the end when you starting throwing items on Ferrari 😂😂😂
Bro gave a free ad for Ferrari
wtf man  , you know how many african children could have eaten that ferrari ?
In 9hrs! 1m views! 🎉
God is good, amen to Bugatti Chiron can't wait for that
Huracan cover 💀
Just Real Life Forza Horizon...
RED IS DEAD!
i loved the g wagon videos but yeah this one is a hard one to watch
That’s a lotta rocket launchers
POV Ferrari typing...
Kind of like a Trojan commercial at the end there lol!
pretty impressed with the bubble protection deflecting everything they threw at it......next up a missile
Yaaaa.. totally getting sued lol but to him it's worth it lol
Looking forward to the C&D
Can you send me a bumper or something from the ferrari, I need money for my rent.
Ferrari need to pay you! This car review showed its diverse capabilities! I now want to buy 5 of them!
CAN THAT BUBBLE BAG STOP A BULLET?
There are still people saying that this dude cant drive…
BRO YOU ARE INSANE 😂😂😂😂😂😂
He made a add without even making it.I just got myself a bubble bag and it will arrive in a week.
Strangely the Ferrari didn’t split in half
amazing ending
Let’s see it repel the chieftain
Tax the rich have competition
I usually love the videos but can't help feel bad for the Ferrari 😂
How many ladders do you have jesus
Awesome awesome awesome !!!
Ahh nothin like a classic WD vidya at 3am to warm the soul
How about paying for my cancer bills? That $400,000 could do a lot of good….but nah, let’s act like a moron on YouTube….free country, more power to you but damn….
nice
YEAH BOI
This is awesome 😂
Ohhhhh my GAWD !!!!     "Give me a hammer!!!" is absolutely the best part! You fucking madman!
What a great advert for both Ferrari and the Bubble
You gotta sell this to tavarish or Tyler Hoover when your done 🤣🤣🤣
You make the most 🔥 videos, those donuts are too clean , Ferrari doesn't deserve you
Remember we used to be friends in highschool? - Mark
This guy reminds me of my girl when I got my 1st clapped out bmw 335... No respect at all just doing whatever to it🤣 Had to learn it's just a car. Automatic subscription!!!
10/10
Definitely has a Tax The Rich vibe, but this is more awsomer!!
I don't like Ferrari's alleged historical paranoia.  I find it to be utterly joyless and counter to the dream of owning a 'supercar'. This is why I bought a 2001 Renault Scenic instead! 🤫😉🇬🇧
I’d say Ferrari 1, Cody 0, but then I remembered Ferraris catch fire. Also, how much shit can u throw
....I bet you wouldn't do pikes peak
Laboiserie mais encore pire
Brings me pure joy to see you drive that Ferrari like we all want to
POV: Forza Horizon 5
Forza Horizon IRL
bro what if this is how Ferraris where meant to be used 🤯🤯🤯🤯
Yooo
10:18 how npcs see me pull up to the mission in gta
Hello From France my boys
I love your vids but this one kinda hurt and some how you still made me laugh(you a magician)
Some paddle tires and the would be a great sand rail
12:18 I FREAKING DIED LMAO
Should have used screws to put that duck over the Ferrari badge
How does it look like it’s got NO damage?!
Why haven’t you did a torture test on the Ram TRX, everyone been waiting for that. Bc that’s the best truck in the world
Please destroy a Tesla ❤
Fucking hilarious, the bubble did it for me. 😂😂😂☠️☠️☠️
Since you know how to make money, donate more for poor people. Advice from muslim friend. Peace.
Watching someone who can actually drive, drive a fast car is great lol
My wife asked, "why are you laughing so much?"  Me- Because I'm watching the best YouTuber piss off world!!!
Can you put a lift kit/off road tires on one of your sports cars?
For part 1, it held up well
This man just destroyed the car I’ve been saving up for for the last couple years in 12 minutes ….😒
Cody should do a durability test on our Toyota land cruiser because there the best truck in my opinion
Ferrari should make a rally version, it's actually pretty good off road
Cringing 😮🙈🙈
Oh yea and she'd  be alright on the farm rounded  up the cattle and sheep ,  no need for tooting the horn just rev limiter it and let the crackling exhaust and bright red paint  do the job ,     Cody take a super flash  car out  into a live stock setting and round up live stock with it instead of atv 4 wheeler motor bike  of big 4x4 Ute truck  ,,  show them you can have and use the very effectively living on the land  ha ha ,   it would make a good video and the people you take out will totally  piss them selves at reactions  of the farmers your out there with ,  just don't wreck the fucker in a minutes time 😂
I really don't no if you will ever See this butt if you ever do Most of the stuff you do well I can't say most all of the stuff you do is aspiring I can't say I wish I had the opportunity to do the same things but I really wish I had the confidence that you did when you started this channel And look at it now Keep pushing Your personality Is  One of a kind Don't ever change
Squatted Ferrari
OMG That car really took a lot a LIVED! The ending was a pure GOLD i couldnt stop laughing! 😀make it into a pickup truck xD
😂awesome video you’re my idol I hope I can meet you some day
lets goooo!
What’s up with all the boxes in the background in the last part?
You should ask to help with koenigsegg crah testing im shure they would love your help.
The end was so awesome :DDDD
I bet he will never find that 10mm wrench ever ever every AGAIN 😂
repaint it pink with pink and white badges
13:30 that shit killed me lmao
Think you’ve been playing a little too much forza Cody.
U suck Ferrari
Bro I love you
Whistlin diesel is doing things with the Ferrari that I be doing in Forza
This one won't hurt me a bit to see get destroyed! Awesome guys guys!
Ferrari should pay you to do this. Most interesting Ferrari video ever.
Looks like the car will cease to exist before he gets that cease and desist
You still have the coach wagon wheels? Ferrari..horse..coach wagon wheels...
How many views for this video alone for the roi of that ferrari? 😂
Goodness gracious... I love it
I work for amazon delivery and i would love to see how quickly you can destroy a prime delivery van. The van I drive is trashed and I'd love to see how durable the vans are...   y'know for...   safety reasons
I thought I was living for real life on need for speed.
altho i felt bad for the Ferrari this might be the best Ferrari advertisement ever
Didn’t really abuse it that bad , let’s go for phase 2 of durability 😎 time to jump it
First thing to come to my mind when I hear Ferrari is cheap plastic put together by children
Two things:  A: I laughed so hard that I literally whizzed;  directly without any hesitation or control straight into my pants at the entire bubble presentation (that was pure GOLD)  2: I am positive we haven’t even seen the beginning of the journey of this car yet, even though this was literally the beginning of the end of the beginning of the funny of the beginning to the end of something that will end of this car. Remember how pissed off that firefighter was when the fire truck got flipped over? That was also GOLD.
My neighbor needs that bubble,he’s Tercel Toyota has several shot with her shoes every morning can’t imagine a flying ladder 😂😂😂😂
Litterly fucking crying so much hahaha .your a legend
Hear me out…. Ford vs ferrari.  Get a mustang and make it seem like its better to ruffle ferrari feathers… 😭
Great advertising for that bubble🤣
😂😂😂
Hadi bakalim
THIS!….
engine swap a truck with it
The guy Ferarri deserves hahaha
Did u even have the front lift up?
1 k dislike,  ı think they are ferrari legal team
Living the dream. Love it!
The best video I've ever watched 🤣
@DDE Daily driven exotic has nothing on whistlindiesel
bro is playing fh5 in real life
Make it a rally car
please Whistlin don't smash that Ferrari, just send it to Africa and I bet ill be the only owner of a Ferrari in the whole of Africa 🤣🤣
Pretty disappointed thought he would wreck it.
I already liked it once, How do I like it again??!??!?
Thiiiiis... is Ferri
Can't wait for more vigorous testing
Ay man im down to take the Ferrari if u down to do a free 400k$ giveaway 💀😂
oh maaan, you have done it, you have just done it!
Rather impressed with its handling
Do a video with La Boiserie
Bro the gun sounds
Who woulda though ole boy would eventually care about his shit
Cody Is playing Forza Horizon in real life 😂
With the car in the bubble, you could place a hot wheels billboard behind it, and it would look like a zoomed in pic of a toy 😳
Oh Cody this is up their with the best of the best for sure ,,  that bubble  wrap I gotta admit I shit myself laughing  with the well let's say if it wasn't bolted down it was thrown at the ferris-wheel  ,,  fucking l9ved it ,   your the best mate I love ya
Rap this car😂
As a person that loves Lamborghinis, I approve of this destruction.... 👍
This was face=cramping stuff. Grinning during the whole video. The end was legendary.
Can't wait for part 2 where it should get modded.
one of the best by far holy
Surprised they even let him buy it
How to get on Ferrari's Black List in a cuple of hours😂
I think you should launch it into a a shit load of porta johns
The first thing I think of Ferrari is Lawsuits
The most entertaining guy on youtube.
Hahaha.. pure comedy gold. If WD has this much momentum in 20 years imagine the mass destruction capabilities. Obviously by this point he shalt haveth taken overeth the world
Now please attach it to a Spy Balloon and let it lift about 20-30 ft. before you shoot it down with a couple shot guns.
It’s so funny how the shit he does with that is the type of stuff I would do in gta
Sir WD, please spare a poor boy that gorgeous Mystery C2 I see youve got urself. I would literally die.  Vid was fantastic😎
Now you’re blacklisted bro
This will be good. The ferrari people are gonna be so mad. I'm already looking forward to some guy beeing mad on winwiki
Jump the g wagon over the Ferrari 🤣🤣
You are getting soft
You 100% NEED TO start your own legit insurance company since no one else will ever insure you in life. Also a lot of people would insure with you just so you get so much additional income putting claims in on your own sh*t that won't be disputed you can dream up so much more of your already almost unlimited crazy ideas!! 👍
lawyer up, biccchhh🤣🤣🤣
You're crazy in the way we need right now.
Dude they balloon is crazy, it literally stopped that whole broom
Ohhhhhh, this hurt to watchhhhhhhhh
When’s Ferrari mulch on sale
I love you but this was the hardest one to watch 😢
13:19   the best advertisement\customer review the bubble company could ask for....
That was a really beautiful work of art car ouch
ken block would be proud
คลิปนี้จะเป็นไวรัล😆
Bro that bubble wrap is actually durable, I need it for my bicycle
It's like real life forza
After this video idc im buying one
A 458 is arguably one of the best sounding N/A V8s. Why are people saying it's a poor man's Ferrari? A 355 is a poor man's Ferrari.
last minute is too good
He gonna get a lawsuit
BMW is the best, but don't test.
Bro I’m dead asf😭😭

Amagine being whistling diesal. Must be the coolest life to live ever. Buy what you want, not give a shit, having fun 24/7. EPIC VIDEO CODY

Angry letter from Ferrari in 3. 2. 1.
No he did not 😢
Yooo if they didn’t pay you for that advertisement then they should. What a product
And they said money can't buy happiness..he just proved they was lying😂
I’m not the one who really cares about materialistic things but dang this is my absolute dream car and this video is killing me 😅
Now imagine a BUGGATI video
13:57 but can it float?
I was laughing for all 14 minutes and 11 seconds, that was fucking hilarious. Do a rolls next.
Ferrari really seemed very durable in your fast and extreme drifts across the property
Who would let you buy a Ferrari
Bros living in gta😂
never thought that I would see a ferrari in the mud.  Also never thought that I would want to see it with front and rear bash bars long travel suspension and wwc studded snow tires.  But a man can dream and pray.
If you are thinking of buying a car, bring i to whistling diesel for testing
Funniest 14 mins ever on yt 😂😂
🤣🤣🤣
Some off-road tiers on it 🫡🫡🫡🫡
He only asked for a Hammer not the whole shop😂
*Big woop... I do this all the time in Forza Horizon 5.* 😅🤣😂 For real though... that thing handled off road... just like in the game...
the gun shots fx @ 13:45 is just gold man 🤣🤣🤣
Next should be koenigsegg they hate Every customer
Hilarious :)
Omg, this guy gives zero fk's about.....ladders

New TaxTheRich
The only problem i have with this video is the bubble skit.   Now all those tools are going to embrace the bubble even more now as it was actually impressive.  Allso the driveway drifting was pretty impressive as well.
Clickbait much,not seeing the 'destroy' part of it
People are going though shit and you do this you are odd get help
😢😢😢
Ken Block sucks compared to WD in terms of entertainment
Forza IRL
Everyone says that he is broke. GUYS LOOK AT HIS FUCKING GARAGE !!!! You think some broke bum gonna have those type of cars.
13:16 i absolutely lost it
How did this become an ad for the giant car bubble
Would have thought they would have thrown a kitchen sink at it for the grand finale.
Would have thought they would have thrown a kitchen sink at it for the grand finale.
Barely destroyed it though did you Cody... Clickbait!
fun vid
This felt more like an add for Ferrari than anything. I want one now.
When Ferrari comes after your car because they have a gigantic ego. Crush it and send it back to em in a box for me ok.
I'm hoping ferrari just sends you a lot of cars for apology that something you have done hasn't been made earlier haha
Wow, that's a cool, fast red sports car! Just wait for the lawsuit... lmaoooo😅🤣😂🙄
Omg it sounds like a car from GTA V.
I’m in love with you ❤
This Ferrari would be killer offroad especially with 4wd
YEESSSS YEESSSS DESTROY IT MUAHAHAHA
.
that ferrari sounds great holy shit
me watching the dior jordans and airmags getting destroyed but this is something else
Yes! Yes! Yes! You are it bro! Fuck Ferrari.
TaxTheRich100 with crashing instead of skill driving. Love it, especially bubble test!
Real life forza horizon
Yeah, definitely lawsuits😆
you are G.O.A.T, The ultimate Goat
When you click like BEFORE the video starts on then immediately rewatch it again bc it's fucking awesome!!
saudi Arabia drift🔥🔥🔥
That ending though 🤣
Masterpiece
Well that car cover company just got their free commercial lol.

If you are so worried about Ferrari lawyers just get a Lamborghini, they don't give a flying fu..
this is how u drive a stooooopidly expensive car
Honda K series swap it and watch people lose their minds.
double it and give it to me
You always live up to your name bubba NEVER EVER CLICK BAIT that is why I can't wait for the next banger!  I know I speak for everyone but we've been anticipating for a while and you definitely didn't disappoint my brother!
Throw a javelin thru the bubble into the windshield😂
J turn testing and shoot the door with a arrow
He’s telling us money it’s just an extra in life love u
Satisfying to watch great video as always
Shit man, this was awesome!
WhistlinDiesel knows how to live a life :)
If only condoms held up that well
At the end I still see a totally intact car.
cease and desist letter speedrun any%
You know it´s a good day when Cody is uploading a video! One of my favorites yet… I can only try to imagine what you guys will be coming up with in the future 😂
You did not really destroy it did you?
Facts
So, Did you get sued yet ?
👍👍👍cool )))
The part at 13:00 ! haha
bro the end of the video had me laughing so hard lmao
😂😂😂😂 awsome
Normalise off road Ferraris !!!
you're a fuckinnnnnn legend brooooooo🤣🤣🤣
Destroying squatted trucks is one thing, but this? This ain’t it. More money than brains.
Cease and Desist Cody! 🐎
I need to win 100 million bucks. So we can have proper competition lol. Cmon national lottery.
repaint it with wall paint
mans is playing forza in vr
Bro was playinf Forza Horizon irl
I just know if the first hammer would've popped the bubble... they still would have just continued to chuck everything at it
3:15 that's the moment you've been looking for
Will the 50cal pop a hole in the bubble somewhere by the door area?
Ferrari cease and desist Speed Run.
Well... I suppose that's a better use for it than having it sit in a garage and increase in value.  😆  That's one hell of an advertising budget!
13:18 when I go to school😅
The only reason I subscribed this channel 💀
I love how bro can actually drive tho 🙌🔥
That’s the best marketing that car protection company will ever get 🫡
no way i was the only one watin for some weird shit to be thrown at the end there after the tools lol but never happen just your normal garage stuff.
This is just me playing forza
Me playing GTA 5 using Ferrari😂
I think destroying this will not anger as many people as destroying something like an E30 M3 or similar!
dude ur vids are fireee!!!💯💥💥💥🔥🔥🔥
Oh my God, Cody, your Crazier than a shit house rat. What will you come up with next? Lol.
Bro they gonna just sue him for having the Lamborghini sto cover on it 💀(don’t get me started on the other stuff)
you should bring the f8 to the 4th of july event in alaska, bet they'll love seeing a bright red car jump a cliff
That suspension tho. Why is Ferrari not making a rally cars?
Probably the sickest yet painful video I've seen yet.
😧
the bubble was the best part.
Now i want a Ferrari man 😅
heeheh
400k for a c8 Corvette?! Inflation is nuts
Legendary ending 🤣
You took the wrong ferrari you should have taken the ferrari purosangue and put a safari snokel 😂😂😂
1:32 man those 930 turbos !!!!!  3:19 never expected this 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I dont know..but you might will be banned from Ferrari soon..
Inb4ceaseanddecist
All this and the cease and desist light doesn't come on but remove the logo and......
that is quality content. Love your videos, Cody. And as a bonus all the ferrari fanboys get mad, there is literally nothing better.
His life is just gta 5 at this point
As a representative of Ferrari, I can indeed confirm we are coming for you.
i think bros lawyer is saul gooodman
Best video I've seen on the net today 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Please tell me you’re gonna build a race track at your property
Fr tho he basically tagged so many people at the beginning of this video
We need a Ferrari vs Chieftain for the next vid.
Enough to make a grown man cry.
Is it just me, or does Cody calling all the stuff they do: "we do not care" instead of "i do not care" makes everything sounds so much more humble? Congrats on the Ferrari! I watched the throwing stuff waaayy too many times already 😂👍
another man is going to get banned from buying ferrari LOL
bro part 2
Sooo car protector is indestructible, cool
ROLMFAO!!!
That car bubble is a freaking bomb shelter!!!!
💪💪💪💪🤤💪💪💪💪 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I love it. 🤣✌🏻🇳🇱
Cody is the new TaxTheRich
After all the electronics Go into seizures. Rip em out. Bypass them whatever you can cook up to get around them. You should put spacers on it and put some big tires on it. So if it flips you can still drive it upside down. lol
Dudes just played forza lmao
Childhood dreams on steroids...
hahaha 😂
Ferrari execs watching this video
So forza horizon Physics was real after all😂
Forza in real life.
This is by far the hardest video to watch like I'm not gonna bitch that he shouldn't do it but it's still hard to watch lol
How many fucking ladders you have??? 😂😂😂
Can almost here all the exotic ladies & gents screaming at their screens. 😆😆
how comically do you want the bubble wrap test?  yes
Ferrari need to make a F8 rally car after seeing this thing rip off road.
ممكن تضع تراجمه في المقطع 😉😉😉
You are one crazy sob. Love the video
14:00 what are all those army looking boxes in the back
My heart is racing god damn,
Hands down whistlindiesel is da FUNKING man 😂🤣😂. 🔥🔥🔥 content! u one crazy ass dude
Man the new Forza Horizon looks good
That was perfect. Thanks for the video and the hard work making content! 💪 on em 💯  cause it's gold footage right there
Those Vossen wheels look sooooo good. I miss mine
Bro I’ve been checking every day, I’m so happy this finally dropped
Duribilty test .??
The ending is worth it!
Plot twist Ferrari sponsors you
Lamborghini aventador durability test would  be incredible
Jambo plushie?
You own the car how does anything they say hold up in a court. It's literally your property. Idgi
Ok but can I get the link to that car bubble...
Total it and send the clip to Ferrari
Bro is playing gta irl🤣
I smiled way to hard during this entire vid
POV gta online in real life
Can i have the steringwheel when your done with it XD
I see the thumbnail and think “he’s not” every time. I don’t know why I think it’s clickbait when it’s the only channel where it’s worse than the thumbnail!
It always saddens me when the videos end 😢 great stuff 😂
Has Ferrari tried to sue you yet?
My guy is living a real GTA life! LOL! I love it!!! ❤😂
money hates this man
I wanna see that Ferrari get mulched and sold in jars
You should put off-road tires on it and lift it
Can’t wait to see what happens
Can't wait to see all the Facebook Ferrari Boys go crazy 😂😂😂
I'm literally crying.. The ending, pure finesse!
Horse dick actually made me laugh out loud.
RIP THE WATER DRAIN
5;43 kid is dead
830k views in 8hrs 😮 well done Cody 👌
This man is playing forza in real life 😂👍🏿 you’re definitely living life
Who said money can't buy happiness! well done dude
I can imagine Cody‘s lawyers are sweating heavily as they watch this video
:))))))))))
Monster Max 3?
But they didn't ask the question, Ferrari or Lambo?
holy fuuk lol give er shit bud that car condom works
i'm sad that i will never be able to get one or even drive one
Pretty impressed so far...but hes been fairly gentle
#itwillbuffout 😂
I love the content man and videos like this like I wish I had the money to buy my family a house let alone be able to do things like that man but keep up the amazing content and just remember keep destructive
Finally a guy who drive his car
Yeees finally another upload 😂🎉🎉🎉
Can I have it?
Pains me to see this... But why do I feel a sense of enjoyment
Didn't click on your video to watch it, just came to thumbs down and call you a fucken retard.
My only request is please make a sick edit before he destroys it
Cut something in half with an Arcair slice torch
I'm surprised dis video didn't have a viewers discretion 😭☠️
That Car Bubble, though: Have we finally found something that Cody can't break?!  Tune in next time to find out!
Send this guy to Ukraine. Don't care which side he'll end up fighting for. But I think he will come back as a better man. In a plastic bag or with ptsd. Either one is an improvement.
Here we go!! Another great time thrashing stuff. My best laughs are always here on this channel watching Cody raise hell. I would like to see the reaction of personal at a Ferrari dealership after bringing it in full of mud and weeds. Lol. I also like the input from your camera guy😊. Great fun!!
Me on forza horizon
Ferrari should be happy with this durability test
This somehow makes the car look so much better.
if anything ferrari should be paying these dudes.this is like an ad for ferrari.
Cody's just testing his new legal team
Bet millions of starving kids around the world are in awe of your burning of money...👏
Best video other than Monstermax going into the ocean.
Cant wait for Part 2🤣
You barely touched it. Do it like the firefighter bus
Kinda cool to see a Ferrari doing Lambo stuff
On behalf of the comment section we request another bubble video this time throw everything and the kitchen sink
Cody never fails to put a smile on our faces. If this is your Ferrari one, I couldn't imagine what the Bugatti one would be like....
Should've dressed like the pope when thrashing this overpriced italian sh!tbox
This man treats this Ferrari the same way I do in Forza 🤣 love to see it
Ferrari should give you way more Ferraris
The ending is a good comercial for the bubble company 🤣
Anyone else think of Pink Floyd when they were taking all that shit
Brody is gonna hit list for every car😂😂😂
Legend!!!
This dude gonna wake up with a horse head in his bed tomorrow
Well done
thicc fil a :D
He said street speed ain’t coming for my title lol
the most debility that can be done is to destroy and make content on it!!!!  it's easy to look stupid!
the best car show period.  p.s. link the fucken buble gonna out of stock for ages lol
WD should have been in the car, in the bag.
Yip I knew it, that's just a Ferrari shell on a MR2!
He is fucked
Just when you think Cody might actually go broke he surprises us with another torture test
Bro I aint even get the notification youtube shadowban or somthin
Farrarie are nice cars but gotta love how he just Dosent care
My current financial state is one of extreme impoverishment, yet I find myself occupied with an inexplicable sense of contentment as I observe an individual engaging in the wanton destruction of a high-end automobile, evoking an expression of mirthful laughter. Alas, I am in dire need of the assistance of a benefactor, specifically Cody, for I find myself in a state of imminent financial ruin and struggling to keep afloat :(
Second time watching
when they added a Johnson on the horse i legit thought of it right before they did it lol.
Yesssss
when your Jet-Ski Splashing legal defense team says..." Ferrari?!  yea sure,  we can handle them too!"   Red is Dead baby! keep doing your thing, ill continue with the largest smile while watching 🤣  this series is about to be crazy.  can't wait to see all the incoming Haters, while WD gets even closer to making the Bugatti Chiron Durability Test videos for the world to see haha
This by far the best Ferrari commercial i have ever seen
Great video man
honestly it was quite surprising to see it go this far. Cant wait for the 🔴🔴G-Wagon vs 🔴🔴 F8
Awesome video! I was so excited when you all posted again!
😂😆🤣
That ain't no mud truck but it is a beast in the off-road dirt trail
Meanwhile I am trying to find and afford a running $1000 car. 😅
I love most of the things you do but this makes me want to die
All the cars in the background what 1:35
This is man's goals are beyond Ferrari's understanding. This is art!
This is the best video ever but we need a part 2 ASAP
This has to be the best youtube channel right now
3:18 idk why but i laughed way too hard at this 🤣
Commentaire
Referncement
Nice Video, you should defently build a sandbuggy out of it( Lift it up an put some big ass tires on it)
I thoroughly enjoyed this😊
Just like Angry Birds there at the end 😂
Hard to watch man not from cringing from laughing lol
I'm gonna egg your house Cody hope he respects the time money an effort that is going into it
Cody is that guy
when's it gonna end :(((
Lmaoooooo what a way to tell Ferrari F**K YOU! I can do anything I want with what I paid for. I don’t care what kind of impressions that leaves on the brand. If I’m a billionaire and feel like waking up and buying a new Ferrari just to drive it off a bridge into water I will do as I please. Edit: I would literally pay to watch this court case “suing” etc etc live in action Lmao shi is gonna be hilarious
Car bubble sales after this 📈📈📈
Farari is not going to be happy lol
Who’s this guy think he is 😂I love it
lawsuit incoming
Everyone talking shit just took a big L 😅😂😂 GGS WWD
Only channel that keeps me entertained lol good stuff bro the meme edits are 💯😂
You've gone a bit soft. I was expecting more
Love it
Once again this is why my family and I love your show and your content Bravo awesome, and you just put Ferrari back on the map and whatever that car cover is Good show!!!!!!!
That’s actually insane
Need that bubble for my non Ferrari took a beating, and its spotless. Thank you. I'm glad you legitimately wrapped it up 🤣 all before you give it to her
😂😂😂
Forza real life 😂
All the people blowing you over “how awesome and amazing  that was” and I’m over here just thinking it was pointless and a waste of money and a nice car. Interesting how well it did in the dirt, but I’d rather just watch you burn money around a campfire.
I need to stop blinking my eyes, I missed a lot of cool content
Me playing FH5
when life isnt great we can always depend on WD to cheer us up
Got the biggest D! LegenDary.
I couple buy multiple bullet proof vests of the highest quality for that amount of money and they stop a lot of bullets. I can't even imagine how many this is able to stop.
Bro i kant even get a hellcat and hes doing this to a Ferrari🤦🏽‍♂️😔
IRL Forza Horizon
Now this is a certified hood classic !!!
If Ferarry sue you for offroad then just blame Forza Horizon 5
I died when he asked for an hammer and they trew the whole shop at it🤣
DDE. Daily Destroyed Exotics.
This is the greatest car bubble commercial ever.
Okay but that thing sounds gooooodddd
I hate & love you! I’m cringing & loving it at the same time! Can I have my dream car when your done please?
It hearts nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
You should put some rally tires on that.
PPL DONT HAW TO EAT  AND THEYRE DESTROYINGF CARS FOR FUN,THIS WORLD IS FOKED UP.....
Part 2 of the video. Finish the RRRARI.
Bro is just speedrunning to get sued LMFAOOO
Cody  2018: I clean my truck 2019: my truck means nothing to me 2020: my hellcat means nothing to me 2021: my r8 means nothing to me 2022: my lambo means nothing to me 2023: my helic… Ferrari means nothing to me 2024: I meant to do a follow up on that cleaner from 2018… MM1 died a couple years ago
Guy threw the whole barn at the bubble 💀💀😂😂
This is pure American spirit.. o7🇺🇸
Click bAit , didn’t destroy drove it around his dirt road and had some grinder sparks fly at it, no destruction here except my time watching hoping I would see it actually destroyed like stupid title says 🤬
I want to watch but I'm in the toilet currently, I missed my anti rejection meds and it sucks, but when I'm better I'm watching with surround sound cause you bring my small little world joy
I really wanted a blow up doll to hit it at the end
The mad lad actually did it
This looks like something out of Forza Horizon 😂
nice red fast spots car
We need a part 2
Lmao standing up to the big guy!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪
Dang 😂
Can I have a car please
All the random items thrown at it at the end was epic and funny. Great content
The stock for that car bubble just rocketed up lol😅
taxtherich vibes!
This video had me fucking dying. Please never stop, and please get a R34 for your next vid lol
The best channel ive seen)
He is driving a premium Ferrari car like it's a GTA game☠️
No don't do it. Ok do it 🤣 been hanging to see this
Kill it!!!! 😂
Ferrari - rubbish! Where are crash test bugatti vs tank??? I think bugatti can win (more expensive)🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why are you actually a great driver🤣
where yo eyebrows go?
YOU FREAKING RULE..!!!   🗣GAURD..
Great video, you just proved how awesome Ferraries and Inflatable Storage units actually are.  Both companies should support this channel LOL, honestly, at first, I'm thinking "What an idiot" but by the end, all I could think was "What a genius".
THE WIZZLE and a FERRARI am calling CHIEF BOGO Z.P.D
This was the first time in a long time I actually wanted the car to kinda survive
Bro wtf😐🥺
LOLOLOLOLOL In this video Ferrari is getting clowned and trolled as hard as possible
did you short gun on farari cover
This one had me laughing the whole time. Just don’t monster max it
It’s so funny bc people like them so much😂👌
This is gta 6
Watching the first minutes we need to sell our G Classes and buy a great sounding F8 for Off-roading 🎉  And Italy was just hit by a big digital earthquake 😮
Please please lamborghini veneno
Can we get the behind the scenes of you guys chucking everything at it. That had to be a blast. 😂😂😂
As soon as I saw this, I hit my head on the table
This man is playing Forza Horizon IRL
He just shows that’s it’s all material stuff lol to not worry about anything 😂
Joke about balloon was ridiculous 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The last item almost destroyed it
Cody is back at it right again😂
I’m honestly so confused on how he can possibly afford to keep doing these videos  😅
This😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
as fun as the video is to watch is anyone else amazed at the air bubble's durability? the people who make those should use this as advertising, i thought they would be flimsy as hell
Congratulations on your New Ferrari F8 Tributo, Cody! I hope you at least had PPF done before you brought this Car anywhere near your Property. Enjoy, my friend! It sure looks like you're having fun already!
I now know that I can get a Ferrari and take it back to my village in Africa And it will work like a landcruiser on two wheels
brooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo the poor ferrari
Ferrari entering tractor business,
Someone's been playing grand theft auto with those sick driving skills. Crush it with monster max
thank you WD, this made my day, i honestly didn't know how much i needed this video. ABSOLUTE FIRE
i aint even mad. if i had the money to burn away id definitely do this. $500.000 for a car? yea im gonna put my foot to the floor all the time and do doughnuts and the car better not skip a beat
Hard to watch someone mess with a new ferrari
Bro no hate or enything but be carful because you can give to jail Love your content men
Feel like whislin is the richest on YouTube
*uck Ferrari and their lawsuits. Cody had that DAWG in him, getting a Ferrari when they didn’t let him, furious. HIS MONSTERMAX is a staggering 100000 miles tall, being able to go into the ocean, extravagant. Cody flexing on his haters to it’s his richness and destroying cars, is devious., Lift the car, Weld the diff, put some off-road wheels on it and go jump some dunes in it. Will go #1 on trending for sure.
This has to be a lot of fun
Didn't know Cody has that many cars, wow
lol guys a lunatic love it !
Definetly needs some rally lights on the hood
« excuse me sir, you will be kicked for gta driving »
Okay but we need to know where you got the car bubble at haha
Good job on this one fucking amazing 💀
BHahaha 😆Modena can  kiss my ass basically.
WD can definitely drive! And props to the camera man taking  gravel to the face IN THE RAIN
Dam!
This is just me driving up mount chiliad
That car is a beast indeed. How I wish one day I can get to drive or even own one of those big machines. I mean currently I can only afford VW Polo 🥲
Whistlindiesel does not get enough credit for changing the game completely on automotive YouTube. When people destroy shit, they refer to it as whistlindieseln it. Proud to say I’ve been part of the journey. Keep up the good work bro.
This hurts to watch
The end is the funniest thing I’ve seen in a long time 😂 he just asked for a hammer
How many people were throwing stuff at the bubble😂
nah nah nah nah, you have GOT to destroy a sherp. PLEASEEEEEEEE
Balloon is stronger than ferrari's ego
POV: When I wanna offroad in Forza and I don't wanna wait in the loading screen
I'm disappointed, you didn't destroy it!!!! I guess not yet?
Oh no, I can smell the cease to desist law suit from Ferrari
Forza irl
It’s me in GTA
It sounds like a f1 car
Can i have it 😢
"I bought a $400,000 Ferrari followed by a 32 million dollar law suit"
Next video ferrai(lawyers) durability test
That poor G....
what an idiot wasted so much cash
imagine if that Ferrari had a had a Lamborghini Huracan cover lol XD...
This video is the biggest advertisement the car balloon could ever ask for 😂
A more extreme version of the channel TaxTheRich100 but they did it near 10 years ago in an F50 and an Enzo
Pre-Billion Dollar Lawsuit.
This is GOLD 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What a great video! I definitely wanted to see more, the hill climb was insane! How strong that bubble wrap was impressive!
Need to get dde out to drive it
You should lift it and take it rallying
What a pretty car. Too bad. Oh well, it's your car.
So damn funny
🤣🤣🤣
Sheeesh just the ladders nah fam the whole garage lol great video!
Nice
This in more than next level. More than ultimate level. This is art!
13:17 my man makin a pink floyd intro
The biggest crime here is filming this on a bunch of iPhones. How is Ferrari even going to know it’s their car with this quality.
Y"all put that Ferrari in the bubble then activated How Ridiculous mode. The whole @ss tire was beyond.
the definition of fuck you money
Damn good ad for the balloon lol
Hey Cody I don't think you were expecting this much love huh?😂
great ferrari advertisement thb
Money didn’t change him, just bought him more expensive toys🔥
Where did you get your money to purchase so many toys? A race car for city streets, good idea! You made $6mil from YouTube!
what about bugati
stolen valor is a felony
Man he’s just playing Forza IRL at this point.
cant he get sued for this hope he doesnt
Bro def in trouble with Ferrari soon😭
Litvin actually destroyed his Amg Mercedes.  This is click bait.
I think Ferrari has to thank you Cody, because you show how durable a Ferrari really is.
The sound of a Ferrari on limiter is absolutely insane I love it!
Bro, best channel ever 🥺
Looks like normal forza game play 😂😂😂
just forza irl at this point
8:56 forza horizon in real life 😂
I love his don’t give a care attitude after dropping insane money on a brand new car that stradman would be losing his balls over. I love your videos. You’re the nicest person I’ve met. Literally people who say you aren’t are just assholes with no respect for you as a human. Keep posting killer content!!
Ohhhhh mennnn come on dont due thisss 😟😔😖🤯 give me the car when you Done 🤣😆
FUCK Ferrari.
the video is so good.  I've seen him 3 times now
The  best video no cap without Cease and desist  🤣
You driving around on your property reminds me of when I drag a nice sports car through the bushes to get somewhere quicker on Forza. Your life is literally a videogame dude
one word: cool
A worthy person on the block list
This is me in Forza Horizon 5.
There is no other video on the internet that brings as much joy as this one! My face hurts from laughing so hard!
man you are such a menace and I just love it tbh
Ferrari just looking on in horror as they prepare the lawsuit
Hahaha that ending was so satisfying haha did I even see crutches fly by 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Meanwhile Ferrari at their HQ with their Legal team discussing this video 😂😂
Next video being sued by ferrari
Can I have the motor when you’re done? Looking to put in a Prius👍
tax the rich 10,000
Ken block would be proud
You just filmed the best advertisement video for the bubble car cover! 🤣 on accident!
The reason why you don’t have as many views is cuz we don’t like it when you wreck nice shit anymore. It gets old
BEST VID YET, the vids just get better and better
lift it ang make it a monster max 5
Finally
Fast and furious in real life😃
Shout out to FORREST AUTO REVIEWS, because he literally took that man's M.O when he got in and started taking about the Carbon dash and Seats, lmao....   Oh yeah and the Lamborghini car cover. This man knows what he's doing
Ferrari executives are sitting in a conference room having a meeting watching this video steaming mad asking their lawyers what can we do to him an whoever sold him that car...I love it I hate how Ferrari treats their customers
This guy messing up a Ferrari and I can’t even pay my phone bill.
He’s getting soft. He didn’t destroy it
Dude this is just to much and I love your vids
I miss good old mud pit and rescuing the car with big excavator..:D
Ferrari Blacklist: 50 Cent, Justin Bieber and now whistlindiesel 😂😂🔥
Damn son. He’s done some mad AF things over the years but this was hard to watch. Felt Personal haha. As someone who works big weeks putting up with f**kwits every day and wanting to lose it every other. It was super hard to see one of my top 5 dream cars get tested so hard. Felt like I was watching someone bang my girl.😮😂
Could we have a Durability Test please
What a beautiful machine, One of my favorite cars! was DYING laughing at the end 😂
Crazy. I can't wait for more. You're doing all that I dreamed of while looking at sports cars instead of studying so that I could eventually afford one some day. Now I'm still dreaming and watching your videos while I sit here trying to afford internet......
Bros playing irl forza 😂
Man just did a whole bubble protector promo🤣
The bank when they see what you did to their car💀
sick duel sponsored vid!! or it should be!!
13:17- OMG I THREW UP laughing
the moment something braeks on the car it done for
Nooooo whyyy GOD NO WHYYYYY 😭😭😭😭😭
Bro 😎 he don’t give af
this thing is an all terrain machine well worth the buy :)
You are like Andrew Tate when he does a little off-roading with his Bugatti haha
Didn't even throw a kitchen sink at it smh lol
omg
Im starting to think he owns the TAXTHERICH account and is slowly coming out of hiding.
Dude right on whistlin, your the definition of self made man, so stoked for you, also balls of steel to do stuff like this, it’s funny cuz this I’m like meh not clinching or owching when you dent or scratch or jump on this thing I think it’s hilarious!! Like all the others that have been “Tested” the only one video I ever felt real pain for was the sqarebody Chevy WHY did that truck hafto be red!!! I was like Noooooooo, not mad or nothing cuz your a free man and you can literally do what ever you want with the stuff you own. I was just sad cuz squarebody chevys are the best looking truck on the planet to me, im a GM guy to the core, muscle cars and sqarebodys can’t get enough of them. I have a 1969 Beaumont I live in BC Canada I’ve had it since 2017 haven’t even drivin it yet, put a crate 350 in it, and been trying to save for speed parts but then life kicks me down and I gotta cover life’s bills. I’m so stoked I have an old car to pick away at and one day have the car of my dreams, eventually twin turbo 427 I’d hafto get guitar YouTube famous to be able to afford it or work really hard for a few years,im an Arborist/ former GM mechanic, then fixing cars got so lame to mei couldn’t honestly fix one more car for one more ungrateful customer. Done with it,tree work is my calling. I don’t know why I’m ranting I just wanna say Cody your badass I look up to your attitude of who cares what anyone thinks of you just be happy. And I think that’s amazing!   You got pizzaz man! Keep it up!!! Fly out to BC and sponsor me and my car so I can finish it. Lol jk, take care man you rock.!!!!
at this point he is just playing gta online
I've never laughed so hard 🤣 that ending killed me!
BEST YOUTUBER EVER, THE VIDS NEVER SEASE TO MAKE ME SMILE, LOVE THE VIDS
China spy balloons are out of stock for color white. 🤣
How dare you
So i added a comment an i get a send a message to tbis number bla bla,i take it this kinda thing is a scam?anyone?
I've been waiting for this moment since ud bought the red ♥️ Ferrari.
Ferrari rn: *SCREAMS IN MARIO*
So glad he’s happy that honestly the only thing that matters who cares about a Ferrari 😂
Poor car . Give it hell . It should beable to handle a beating just like any car should .
Bugatti
Love it Fuck im
Best part was the guy with tha stash lmao.
Is it possible to apply for a job to work for you Cody? If so I’d very much like to. I live in PA but would gladly move to work for you. I’m a great laborer/worker, plus my daily driver is a “RED FORD RANGER” which I’d gladly let you destroy for additional content 😂 doubt I’ll get a reply from you but it’s worth a try lol. Love your videos man ✊🏼
9:40 is basically an ad lmao
This had me rolling. Glad to see you having fun pissing rich people off. Keep doing your thing man. Hope to see you at more car meets around town before you destroy them.
Forza horizon in real life
Funniest shit I've seen im quite a while 😂😂😂
Holy shit. That bubble shit I could watch all day lmao. Please do that to every car lmao
*Phone notification pops up *   * Enzo Ferrari wants to know your precise location *
Giving off real @TaxTheRich vibes driving this car around your property lol. Pretty cool.
About time someone give ferrari a 🖕🏻🖕🏻
Ferrari Lawyers just subscribed to your channel gathering evidence for your trial. 😂
He rented it from one of the supercar rental places. He isn’t getting his deposit back. 😂
I love it but it t fells weird to such a nice car so funny
This is actually a fantastic ad for Ferrari it's just taking it 🤣
Best car cover ad
ima be honest I love ferrari don't agree with some of the stuff they chose to do to customers but I don't wanna see it getting destroyed :/
Congrats on your first and last Ferrari
I'd you doing mind me asking and if you can answer it with a rough guess. How many gates have you gone through for your driveway
I laughed the whole video! Thanks for sharing buddy.
You're put out a lot of bangers, but this one had me crylaughing the whole time.
Crazy
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
The ending reminded me of the OG WD location where they he got into a impromptu fight with his assistant and were throwing tools and parts at each other lol.
Kudos to the car condome. I don't know how you guys threw so much shrapnel before falling to the ground exhausted by laughter!!
Have to admit, as someone who prides himself on the preservation of such cars as the F8,this was hard to watch,lol.  Respect and pride are pretty important in the country of Italy. What better way to show that respect than a drive in a vintage or modern Ferrari through the hills of Chianti. Absolutely the best!
i remember you said years ago the jetta would be the only car on the channel. i’m glad that turned out to be a lie.
YouTube hid this video from me
We should make Whistlindiesel’s “We do not care” into the new we do not care meme
This is why I’m subscribed to this channel
new rally car
The ending was perfect
That ending was legendary.
Ferrari will see this as a disgrace to their car and comes black list
Car manufacturers should pay you for this
I can't even imagine what a great video he can make with my monster go-kart.  Maybe we will see.
That bubble was actually really tough 😂
This is ridiculous
All his videos are made in ohio
i LOLd.... HARD
New theory: Cody takes like 7 shots right before the i phones turn on
Throw me a hammer 😂😂 this actually made me laugh 😂
You make me cringe. I bet it can jump.
Best video ever 🤣🤣
Now Wrap it as Monster Maxrarri and go off-road wheels and suspension.
This guy is absolutely hilarious
The reason WD is so great: a 16 minute long video that I was so entertaining throughout that when it ended I thought I had missed part of it.
The bubble abuse test is exactly what we needed.
But is the bubble anvil rated?
It’s like Forza in real life 😮‍💨🙏
hahahahahaaaaa faark i love your vids.dunno how you all wernt crackn up throwing all that stuff at the car,keep up the good work mate.
Bro is playing forza horizon in real life
At this rate  2050: Testing the durability of my space shuttle 😂👀
God!!😄😄
😂😂😂😂😂 lost my shit at the end soooo good
Did you ever imagine you’d be able to take things this far when you were just fucking with your daily driver. Nice grocery getter, stoked to see how this plays out. I hope farrari let’s you buy another one to enjoy. *cough* looks like you enjoyed this one so far lmao
I mean, snorkel it so we can see how it does in water? I’m not sold on a Ferrari yet until I see that.
Put explosives in the turbo
Oh hells yes... Not an exotic car person, and usually giggle when I see one destroyed lol I'm seriously enjoying this lol
I guess I can't complain. I go to thrift stores to find high end clothing to paint homes in. Gotta look good destroying money right?
Мне кажется на втором видео она уже развалится. Итальяшки делают красивые тачки, но не прочные)
That bubble bit was probably one of the best advertisements I’ve seen for a while.
Ferrari watching this : IM gOnNa sUe🤓🤓
Why not destroy it and sell it to goonzquad???
This video gave me abs
The car bubble was suprising.
Honestly you could tear the front bumper off and smash all the windows and I’d still take it off your hands because I think super cars need a few bruises and I’d probably destroy it myself anyway
We are witnessing peak WD.
This is probably something I’d never do, but watching it made me so happy, not to see the car being destroyed but the pure happiness in this man I can feel the vibes threw the phone🤣🤣
You should hire WRC rally champion Kalle Rovanpera to try your cars in the field track 🤣
U been paid to make bubble air protect ferrari ad  🤣🤣🤣
as much as it pains me to see you absolutely ragging this car around, I love it and its putting the biggest smile on my face
what are all those boxes stacked up?
Please fabricate wings for it and try to get it to lift off the ground lol
I was in pain all the way trough the video but cant hate the guy as its his car so he is free to do anything with it 😢Most beat up ferrari ever
Bro is playing forza irl
You're making tavarish very happy
Way better than dde!!! Lol
Haven't pissed myself laughing at a video in a while 😂
No bro better hit a lambo than a ferarri hahahahah love it you crazy
This dude is playing Forza in real life.
Please tell us your an only child and that there are no more siblings out there.
Why destroy a perfect car like that  No hate in your content but I prefer you destroy trucks or junk cars
Your back my man ✋😎🤚
God I love how this guy gets a lot of ppl mad .
I know I’m gonna get a lot of hate for this but I am genuinely proud of you I’ve been waiting a long time for somebody to do one of these videos Ferrari products are way over priced out for a plexiglass back window nothing about that is $11,000 probably almost $100 plus another hundred to install it, most Ferrari parts are resourced from other European car brands I can’t wait to see what Ferrari has to say 👍
i love your show man! best show on the internet! you never dissapoint.   sending likes and shares from down under! : )
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, you should be testing the durability and capabilities of cars
This man beat gta in real life and unlocked all the cars and customization for free just to drive around fast as fuck and wreck the shit out of it 😂💀
so nobody is gonna talk about how he is gearing up for WW3? did you see the shit in his garage?????
Now drop the link to that car wrap
Might be the most wholesome video yet! Love how far this channel has come, it has never ceased to bring a smile to my face. The amount of fun the have making these videos is awesome and hilarious to watch! Keep it up!
This videos are fun. But at the same time so painful
The end was so funny! 🤣
Can’t believe that car went up the wet grass.  Somewhere a pick truck owner shed a tear of shame knowing his truck wouldn’t do it.
Wolf on wall street clip was golden 😂😂😂
When I was about 10 years younger I would've cried looking at this, but after becoming a mechanic, this looks enjoyable. (I got a little touchy on the GTR vid though ngl)
Give me a hammer
I haven't watched the video yet I already love it and you taught ferrari a lesen
holy shit the man can fuckin DRIVE
How much stuff do you have to throw in that shop😂
Shitty Car like G Class is fun to watch, not a Ferrari, have some respect, Ferrari is something Unique not just another Car maker…
That carbubble needs to be filled with Acytelen 🙏
this guy is the biggest deuche he's not even entertaining
He drives like it’s Forza
I’ve never laughed at anything my whole life and you didn’t change that.
This guy is playing BeamNG in real life.
Mans really out here living GTA irl. im here for it lmaooo
👍
Where is the tank.
That ending. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
The lawyer lookin guy with the pen and not pad bout killed me😂 disappointed I can’t laugh at comments from pissed if people tho I haven’t found any. I’m very sad
Bro are you serious. Kids in Africa could have eaten that!
Ласиус, ласиус..
1.33    Now  that's a hell of background 🤩
pouring out some whiskey for the brain cells I lost watching this
Best f*cking videos of youtubeee!!!
I'm sure you could sell the carcass of this Ferrari to Tavarish
That's a great test of that bubble lol
You guys are FUCKED!!!!!!! 😂
Ive been waiting on WD to destroy a Fucrarri since his first video...Thankfully the time has come.
im proud of you u didnt destroy the whole farrari
Reminds me of forward horizon
Can it skip on water like the Lambo on Cannon Ball run?
It was fucking insane 😂😂
I give this 5 cappys out of 7.
Waiting for the cease and desist 💀💀💀 I made this comment before I watched the first 10 seconds lmao
I like how a few seconds after he says "rally car baby!" it shows him why it doesn't qualify loll
Dude, that's so hilarious! One of your best videos so far.
take 2 ferrari engines and make mostermax 3.0 lol
What we've learned today is that the f8 is the best offroader
I just love watching materialistic things that everyone would die for get destroyed. Lmaoo it’s a materialistic thing people it’s not the end of the world 😂
If he doesn't get sued , I'll will walk outside naked 😂😂😂😂😂
BRO i have never laughed this much at a video in my entire life. you’re a damn legend. i’m seriously so happy for you and how far you’ve come in the last few years. never stop dude you’re such an inspiration
GTA real life
Lmao cracked up when you jumped in the frunk
Love and support from Chico CA I forgot I was having a bad day till now 😭🤣😭🤣😭🤣❤🙏🙏🙏🙏thanks for alll the hard work u do for us hell ye brother cant wait foe the next 🎥❤❤❤❤❤😍MASTER WD!!!!!!!!!

I know Cody threw that gasoline can🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
All jokes aside I can't get over how fucking good this thing sounds. It's the one thing ferrari always gets right
Next video: "We're getting sued!"
I was waiting to see a kitchen sink get thrown at the bubble to be honest
New forza gameplay looks crazy
5:55 "what are you wearing?" this is too epic lmao
I love you I swear
you guys are overlooking this way too much this could change the whole car scene if he beats this case with Ferrari if they ensue legal action be a very rich person go by Ferrari
Buggati durability
Next video: Ferrari sues us Now it’s time to add a 6 inch lift kit
I've never thought that I'm going to say this but, the Ferrari drives better than Monster Max in the mud.     PS - try using ethanol vs pump gas.
this is the first time in a very long time it hurt me a little to watch.   just a little
He didn't fully destroy it yet because the car cost too much for one video. He would literally need like 20 million views to pay for this car and break even. Crazy AF 🤣
this shit is next level
Ferrari has been known to sue Ferrari owners for defiling their cars. They probably are spamming out right now. Expect a Ferrari representative to contact you.
That last scene was hilarious 😂
I think this is what the old Top Gear would've evolved to 🤣🤣..beautiful and risky content as always 💀
Don't destroy them give them to me
Unbelievable 😮
You should buy me one
at first, i thought that spending 400k on a car was a thing a fool would do. but thanks to whistlin diesel i have decided to chase my dreams, i will sell my house, my family and my organs to buy this very durable ferrari. thanks whistlin diesel!
Nouveau Rich shouldn't be allowed to own Ferrari's.
👍👍 💪💪
8:55 me in forza trying to build a skill chain
HERE WE GO
Next time when you buy a car at a dealer. Redline it while its still in the showroom. Say that the gas got stuck
Wait so Cody managed to buy a ferrari without first buying a ferrari to buy a ferrari that lets him buy the ferrari that lets him buy this ferrari
But he really got me when he said they put a drain on the hood
Honestly Ferrari is gonna die of anger after this video
they just keep getting better and better.
real life gta character
Also how much goddamn money do you make
I was waiting for you to destroy it. I am disappointed.
Dudes playing forza irl
Love the cases
Good stuff man, can't wait to see what else you do with this.
Umm...
okay I want one of the Chinese car balloon things now
Here Before 1M views….. Also here before the world is talking about Ferrari’s latest lawsuit…..
reminded me of forza horizon 4
I can't believe what I just saw OMG
Why have you done this.
I don’t think I’ve ever been this entertained in awhile thank you ✌️👻
Too much driver and not enough car. I gotta lie I’m really impressed
I love this dam I hate fagrarris I worked on some back in the day doin gaurd rolling and having a look at the welds on the alloy chassis I would never drive one 🤮🙋‍♂️🇦🇺
i was cringing but also smiling the whole time ty cody -Ferrari fan boy
i was having a panic attack for the entire 14min and 11 secs
The ending was crazy 🤣🤣🤣
What an awesome video bro
This is to be the best video yet.
Sick mctwisted episode Cody
This is Forza in real life for me 🤣
I was watching one of your earlier videos and thought he's going to be a Lambo or Ferrari and bash it... Fast forward to 2/19... BAM! lol
1 Timothy 6:10   king james version bible  10 For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
Ferrari: hey we just wanna talk
Needs ffs spacers
Very cool. I was expecting something like this
Not one mud bog ?
Was waiting  for you to throw another Ferrari  at it !!!!!!!
Absolute legend. Drop it from a helicopter next.
You didn’t destroy it you just used it correctly
This is why I will always watch you
Whistlindiesel is no more. It's whistlingasoline at best.
To be honest, I want to see the comment just because I thought there was going to be a lot of heat, but everybody loved it even myself 😂
TaxTheRich100 is back on YouTube oh wait its WhistlinDiesel
I was crying all the way through it😢
Tires need some tread Lift that mf n take it on a mug trail bro
Ferrari lawsuit eminent.  Edit: I wrote this comment within the first 5 seconds before whistling said lawsuits. LOL!
This guy live in his own version of forza/gta and I’m jealous😂😂😂
A koenigsegg Durabilty test would be so good, almost as good as the zonda   R. But honestly just getting a koenigsegg would be cool enough as is, he just needs to sell everything he owns to get one😅
Top 3 funniest, best edits you've done! Keep it up
I think you’re a f u ck wit for this one. Any other car I’m ok with.
Ok, now I need the car bubble. Where TF did you get this?
this was the funniest shit ever😂
It’s so beautiful pls no
The crutches hahaha
i hope you don't do anything stupid
Where is the destruction... and the durability test....
5:55 Stolen valor.
Noo this video felt so short!! I can't wait to see more Ferrari content!
For the fist time ever Cody - 0 Bubble - 1  just take the L.  It actually held up to you, now i can buy one and be sure it protects against anything you can literally throw at it!😂
OMG 😱🤣😂🤣🤣😂😂🤣😂 you’re too much!! But you definitely gave the Ferrari what it needed 💪
Bro the end had me dying🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
❤️❤️❤️
I will come pick it up when you are done playing with it👊🏼☎️Hit me up WD
Forza Horizon in real life
Holy Rich!
Rally Ferrari......check
Missed Seeing You, Cody. Love This Video! ❤️ 😂 Give Me A Hammer! 🔨
everything known to man was thrown at that damn car
Watching it go up that hill was beautiful. I thought you'd race down hill fast as hell. This was awesome
I know I’m gonna sound like a hater here but, hear me out. This dude is so not funny. I get his whole YouTube persona thing and he makes decent money from that. But his sense of humor is so cringish. This is the 1 time I truly hope Ferrari really does make someones life miserable. Only because his comedy is so subpar.
Btw I need this kinda fu@& you money 😂😂😂😂
I'm from Indiana. Family an u are truly one of the best realistic YouTube I ever had known. Bro keep up the great work.
0:41 first lawsuit coming in
Welp ya put it to the gravel test, time for the snow test
you should make a video with the cboys
I feel bad for that car 😢
Nor enough destruction
Bro is living forza horizon in real life
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️⭐
idk why but i was smiling and simultaneously cringing while watching this🤣🤣
"Lawsuit" is actually the first word I was thinking of when I saw the thumbnail of this video
That car deffo needs a lift kit and knobbly tyres
550K IN 5 HOURS
I seen all the cars in the background at the start I'm like shit all those probably will be destroyed some video
Now imagine doing that with a 488 pista!
Only one thousand gallons of gas where used in the making of this video 😁
greatest video of all time
He playing BeamNG in real life
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bro is literally living in forza
So sick 🤘
Yaa yaa...big deal....
I wish I had enough money to do this.

@whistlindiesel can you buy a 2014 Nissan frontier  sv4x4 and do a durability test
Is this you? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqSTXuJeTks
I could bottle c(k?)odies head shine and sell it as car wax.

Ferraris lawyers are smoking the fattest cigarette right now

Pain pain and anguish

Greatest YouTube personality ever fucking love this cunt
Damn that bubble is impressive lol
So awesome that you made the driveway so you could drive from the street to your garage!

Let's go Doug Demuroooooo!!! 🤣🤣
It’s like I’m watching a real life version of Forza horizon
Sick car I want one
I'm thinking Ferrari needs one in camo with all terrain tires a wench and a roof rack. A hunting version. I introduce the Ferrari WD!
Was waiting for this,this is epic go WhistlinDiesel🤣
He should of ran his pizza delivery Lamborghini Huracan that he bought from TJ hunt into the ground and kept the Ferrari bad choice lol😆😆🤣😝😝
Bro thinks its gta5
I love it so much Daddy Diesel. I laughed, I cried from laughing, I felt so fulfilled. You’re my favorite YouTuber. Took over the reigns from CarnikCon❤❤
this gta 6 gameplay is amazing
man is literally playing the real-life version of forza
I was surprised how well it did off road. Why tyres did it have on it
It's my birthday and I feel like this video was my present from WD
Its a Rental car.
Just remember, if it's red... it's dead
This guy never fails
Can we just appreciate just how good Cody’s driving skills are aswell!! He can drift anything….
I can already sense the lawsuit coming…
put a lift in it like monster max and have the worlds first lifted Ferrari
Do a Porsche next 🤪 that'll be tough to watch
Reaper wheels when
That crashed Enzo dean karnages father actually tried taken the blame for that. True story.
Me when I need to get to a destination in Forza Horizon 5 taking a detour. 7.51
Here comes the sieze and desist
GTA real life
Giving tax the rich vibes awesome
When I grow up, I wanna be like Cody and beat the living shit out of a Ferrari Off-road too.   This was genuinely my favorite WD video to date.
i cant stop laughing at all the stuff being thrown at it. hahaha
Thore a knife 🗡 at it!
I don’t care what your opinions of him are, Cody is a pretty skilled driver
Anyone else want to see him beat up a tesla in a tesla durability test?
Like this one
this video gave me anxiety
Let's see a jump bo duke Jr
I predict 3 durability test videos.
yall needed a break after throwing so much shit 😂😂
If it’s red it’s dead 😂😭
Whoever threw that first mallet was trying to fucking kill Cody 🤣
⚠️Please⚠️ TEST❗️an AU Ford Falcon best burnout car IN THE WORLD 🌎 Ps the engine will never die. 🛑
This turned into the greatest ad for that bubble company
🤣🤣🤣🤪🙏🥰❤️‍🔥 I so needed this! I haven’t laughed in a few days! Your helping my mental health!
This is like real life forza lol
the ending was true comedy gold
That Paul Walker Car what happen crash he died RIP
finally someone who actually drive a ferrari love it
I hope your legal team is the dream team, Ferrari won't be happy, but otherwise super great video i know the car should be driven, i feel bad for the car
Cody is Cody and he does Cody things. Tbh kinda miss the creative stuff. Idc about the price of the goober car. I miss the myth busters shit.
best video ive seen since you uploaded last
The ending part 💀
At this point @whistlinndiesel  you should just give me the g wagon it’s not a diesel and it don’t whistle
Lol it looks good looks like a brick 😂😂
It’s amazing how wd came from destroying trucks to Ferraris now😂😂
🔥🙏🙌
And this end ups in a junk yard
There is not a baller alive that will ever enjoy their Ferrari as much as Cody will.
Can you buy me a ford ranger
WhistlinDiesel my wife loves your videos!! She likes to watch them right before bed because they help her fall asleep lol
Who cares about Ferraris ? Lambo is better anyways thank you Cody
Anybody else noticed the military boxes behind. What is inside there.
Yeah
I hope he got paid to advertise that car bubble bc I want it now
But you didn't even throw the kitchen sink at it.
Was really expecting to see a sink, or the big ass fan, or a human flying towards the bubble after you asked for a hammer
I want to drift that driveway
This man never loses
Car looks amazing out in the fields
Ferrari has found their new rally car driver.
I lost my shit when all that stuff got tossed at it, that was the greatest thing ever.
Looks like average forza horizon gameplay lmao
whistlin diesel's ferrari vs mark mccanns's lamborghini *our battle will be legendary*
If it's red it's dead
Hey Ferrari here is your durability test
Is ferrari going to ban him from buying another one
How the hell are you not on a pre-emptive blacklist?
I just waiting on Ferrari to comment
Yes yes yes ❤️🫡🤟
3 mins in eating 7/11 dip and dots laughing my ass off
I was fr waiting for this guy to do this one day. Loved it!
F*#k those ferraris. If they can't handle this, it's just a piece of @%£*. Cody is being gentle all the time, like always.
I've never smiled through an entire YouTube vid...until now
This vid had me laughing most of the time 🤣, can't wait for more
Mtf will do anything for clout grow up bro.
These guys videos always make my day
What's with all the cases?
Aura of protection.
I'm not a Ferrari fan but man that thing sounds sick on the limiter
Dukes of Hazard: Ferarri Edition.
It's about damn time someone used a Ferrari the way it was designed to be used Edit: I'm beyond sick of all these goddamn bots leaving spam comments all over the place. Fucking do something about it YouTube, goddamn
7:13 reminds me of taking any car offroad for the first time in forza horizon for the first time. first thing that came to mind was like 😅 who would do this irl. now i know
I love watching your content and it's fun watching you destroy things but I think I enjoyed watching you destroy squatted trucks more then a Ferrari. Regardless great content.
You should put all your cars together and make 1 video destroying all of them. It would be cool to see, especially the lambo
Great to finally see a super car doing something super
I envy how careless this man is about life 😂
13:43 I’m sorry was that a muffin tray???
How can I get me one of those crates in the background??? The green ones please lmk I really want like 2 of those
And now the  protection bubble just sold out for the next 2 years
Goat
10:22 deadass reminds me of gta😂 whole different environment with a Ferrari and then coming out with a whole military outfit
Whistlin’ Diesel really out here grinding for all the obscure achievements.
This is the next pre runner for the baja 1000
COOL
Well someone’s in trouble with Ferrari😂
The last test was the grand finale , perfect I love it
This is like you stole a Ferrari in gta and took it up to the wooded parts of the map and you don’t care because it’s just a game, but this is real life and this is the video everyone wanted.
So fukn pissed at this video for about the first 5 seconds........then just awesomeness haha
Please see if the car bubble floats somehow
i think he is richer than mr beast
That looked like forza horizon 5
You should change your channel name to Daily Destroyed Exotics hahaha
This video was F Fireeee💀🏴‍☠️🔥
Love it
This man playing forza in real life lol
Seems fine
Let's talk shit about Ferrari when it's easier to destroy a $400k vehicle then fulfill a promise regarding a Bugatti.....stfu
You're outdoing yourself every video. 🤯 It's always worth the wait. You're going to get so many barrels of haters tears, you'll never need to buy fuel ever again. 😭😭😭😭😭😭 😁 The ending was like the finale at the end of the 4th of July fireworks 🎇🎆🎇🎆🎇🎆🎇🎆 show. It was hilarious! 👍
Where does somebody  get the car bubble ?
Congratz on the success to beable to do this but at the same time fuck dude..
LITERALLY THE SECOND BEST CAR VIDEO IVE EVER SEEN AFTER THE G WAGON ONE!!!!!!
Forza Horizon 5 in real life be like 5:05
GTA 5 but irl
You forgot to send the kitchen sink at it! 🤣🤣🤣
WhistlinDiesel Great Video and Congratulations on your 2020 Ferrari F8 Tributo and I'm glad you handled it on your Driveway so well and got a protective bubble and I hope you don't ruin it
Bro used the Ferrari like it was made to be used , Ferraris have rally past so why not
Could you buy me a Camaro bro?
This dude said shots fired lol
🤣
I'm impressed.
You are justa simple genius👁👄👁
MORE.
I am going to thoroughly enjoy watching this car slowly reduced to dust in this series of videos. 🤣
Ferrari’s like: 😱😱😱😱😱😱
Tannerite
The only car I would not flex if I was rich, destroy that POS!!!!
You need to make a vid about the Supra at 4:22
This was amazing. You should be sponsored by the bubble company for the end bit lmao
What is this absolute wall of military-looking crates and what's in them 👀
this shit was so funny 😂
Next level car & next level video!
These Forza Horizon 6 leaks are getting crazy
Probably blacklisted, because Ferrari.
You my dude are hilarious
Ferrari, it just was a durability test for Ferrari's team. It did well, nothing to see here.
An even better version of tax the rich
First Ferrari and last Fs 😂
I think you should have used a helicopter not a ladder.
That last scene was epically hilarious, I can picture 30 dudes just hucking shit across the room 🤣
🍭
That’s one way to break it in
Looking forward to see the durability of a Ferrari
You think Ferrari is going sue ? No , they just might start Rally racing though!
You should buy a monster jam truck!! That would be so badass
Can we appreciate how great Cody was driving and looking this vid??
This is real life Forza horizon 😂😂
This is like me on forza horizon 5
One of the coolest/best videos I’ve seen on utube inna while
Tractor first thing I think of
Let’s put it on the durability test
well… uhfuck yeah ya did

As long as ya don’t change the color to pink ya be Ight🤣🤣🤣
When I was 15 I was welding next to a pile of fire works. Best time ever!
Easily his best video ever
People clearly don’t understand this is a comedy channel 😂😂😂
When they kept throwing a bunch of stuff at the car I couldn’t stop laughing! Excited to see what’s going to happen next with car
Bro its such a beautiful car 😫
No super car from the 80s or 90s would survive 10 mins of Cody . They’ve gotten reliability down it seems !
Enzo Ferrari turning in his grave rn
CRAZY SHIT
Dude just lets every intrusive thought win.
Awesome Video, I wish I was co driver while u drifting in the rain....goodtimes...miss being off grid toying with vehicles
It's like watching Arab-money levels of wealth being put to good use.
Bros playing GTA 5 IRL
You should paint it pink.
Forza in real life
😂😂 I didn’t think it was going to end. Was waiting for the kitchen sink
Love it
Nah wtf let me get the car instead
Who cares about the Ferrari, the real star is that car bubble. That's impressive
You could see on the big corner Cody started to pay attention
“It’s some kind of wall of psychic energy.” -Patrick
We need more !
thank god i was gonna be so sad if you actually destroyed this car
This is why I love him 🔥🔥🔥💥💥💥😍😍. Master of Destruction 🔥🔥🔥
this video stupid  bull shit....  because you almost do nothing to make any serious damage   and I know the point:)))))
so nobody else is gonna ask whats up with the "military" grade cases behind the Ferrari in the bubble?
Rev it on red line for 1 minute straight
Love it, Mulched it!!!
You are thee most destructive force on YouTube!
U made my dream. I wish I were with u doing it
That bubble thing slaps
Good god how many people did you have throwing shit at it bahaha 🤣
I think he forgot he isn’t playing forza
Bro what's that porshe and bently do8ng
that one unemployed friend on a thursday
Ferrari video turned promotion of car bubble
Do you know you get decised letter and law black suits
Hey whistlin this one had me grinding my teeth the whole way through . :) . My neighbor crashed his 1998 Ford f-150 if you have any parts to donate that would be sick.
13:50 sounds like the intro to a Pink Floyd song
Congrats if at any point this car is. Sold would be a great project for  dde
Ok now jump it
Ok
Truly a masterpiece as always Cody
13:15 did you hire howtobasic as a cameraman?
Sounds so good
That’s an impressive bubble
I can't wait to see what you destroy in the next 5 years, fuckin blowing up skyscrapers and sinking ships 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is literally me in Assetto Corsa, just taking a Ferrari on a rally track
Is it possible if I can have the Ferrari for free please
Ferrari status “marked safe from unidentified flying objects” 😂😂
OH MY GAWD!!!
This is amazing
Finally! I can’t wait to see it folded up like the Toyota was!
Best content since the f350.   This is great lol.     He starts with the little things then before u know it he has it in the ground as a bunker 🤣
You are the better version of American top gear !!😂
Soooo is this the start of Ferrari Torture Test #2... 😂
dumb
Ferrari should pay you to stop instead of sending you a letter from their lawyers.
Take it to the dunes with paddle tires. 😂 Edit: I'm sold on that bubble. haha
ferally
car from fortnite
Money waster bitch
so in a plot twist you have sold me on the car bubbles
Oh yes
Normally, I don’t like wanton destruction, but the guys at Ferrari are such jerks.
Nah bro why’s this video so damn funny 😂😂😂😂
This goes against my Christian beliefs.  I must stop watching this.  I must stop watching and enjoying this.  I must stop laughing my ass off and enjoying watching this.
That’s absolutely efin amazing
Everything thrown at it except the kitchen sink!  LMAO!!
I haven't laughed so hard in a long time, well done.
I missed these kind of videos. Thanks for the monday morning cheer up.  The company that made that bubble owe you a bazillion dollars for advertising.
u are funny as always, keep it up, kisses from Greece
Bro did it😂
Man is about to get banned from Ferrari
This bubble can withstand the smite of god himself
real life GTA 5
Good rally car?
That last bit was amazing lmao
It's like in Forza when you have to drive to the next waypoint and you go as the crow flies.
Alternate video title:  “How to be on Ferrari’s most wanted list”  I appreciate the tutorial, I’ll make sure I use it later in life.
Thank you Sir
First person to do fun shit with their Ferrari
I just want to know how anyone could afford this... Like money well spent for sure but where is it coming from?
Normal day for you 🙆
You should put a lift kit and mud tires just because 😆
Bro is playing forza in real life😂😂
This video gave me major throw back vibes to Taxtherich100
I’m actually getting a bubble because of the ending
Streetspeed717 releases content of him bashing a c8 stingray in grass and jumping it…. WD: HOLD MY BEER
WhistlinDiesel is an IRL Forza player
Whistle D you have out done yourself Bravo Sir LMAO
The only thing missing was a kitchen sink!
All his cars suck none of them are cool he fucks them all up
Crazy!!! Lol that bubble thing was impressive though
Hope This crosses 10Million +
I watched all the ads to help fund this video.
Buggy wheels ?
This reminds me of off-roading my super car in GTA 5
I’m still waiting on the 2mill in military equipment video
Okay this one was a little painful. Glad you enjoy what you do tho ig 😅🤣
Hands threw the hood drain one of the funniest
That was epic
😂😂😂 he said were so getting sued
I see, my man doing all the Forza Horizon challenges
Lol 😆 🤣 😂  man yall are awsome
Now I know I don't need a built diesel truck to go offroading 🤝🤝👍
This is so good, if this video never stopped, then I would never stop watching it. I literally laughed sooo much. Very much enjoyed it, please do a more thorough video.
What's the markup on the ferrari mulch gonna be? Gonna have to cover legal costs obviously
Oh yeah this is going to be awesome
One day he will look back and realize how pitful and sad it is to see this... Think of the kids he could help
He didn’t destroy it 🤠
million doll hair car or you ussy
For selling to The WhistlinDiesel That dealership was either FIRED or got a Fat Pay Bump!!!
What is that Supra doing back there😑
Actually I'm kinda impressed...
Good on ya mate
Can we show some respect for this man’s driving skills
WhistlinDiesel …u will never cease to amaze me
I love this one. I can’t stand Ferrari’s attitude toward their customers.
Whistlin deisel new videos reminds me of the YouTube channel tax the rich with how he drive them lol
Half a million views in 6hrs - 1 million views in less than 24hrs - let’s gooooo🎉🎉🎉
from 0:00 till 14:11 i was smiling
Dam amazing video,  your living the actual Forza Horizon game 👁👄👁
Theres some cars on the back that haven’t been tested 👀👀
when this Ferrari goes to auction, I hope that carfax will say whistlindiesel
So why did he say to protect it against helicopter crashes feel like he might have n idea for a video
This video made me want a bubble 🤣🤣🤣
WD used to be civilized. He used to take a work truck and hit it with an axe. Now he, shoves… fiji bottle through air ducts???
13:50 the company that makes those bubbles owns you a millon bucks ...
Why is the last part so funny 😂😂😂
Finally someone who made f8 driving good 😂😂😂 kudos man 🌝
Whistlin V Ferrari
Atleast Ferrari survived 😂
When you can afford to play Forza Motorsport in real life hahaha

They are going to put this one of the first on the black list

That ending had my dead 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wow, that bubble worked super good!!
Effin love this brother!
hahaha that was too fun to watch
Please tell me you’re putting the hater tears missiles on the g wagon
LEGEND
Ferrari can’t do anything to you but they can keep you from buying any More Ferrari but again that only matters to someone who actually loves them and wants to keep buying more.
I think he went to easy on it
I enjoy watching these videos so much
My man just gave the best advertisement video for the car bubble brand 😂
13:20 cody had flashbacks to the wrench fight
its a drain in the hood😅
A starving kid in Africa could’ve ate that Ferrari bruh..
lmao wtf
Make more content with the General Lee
I wanna see you inside the car when you put it in the bubble then drive it and see what happens 🤣
Ferrari is kicking dirt right now but dailydrivenexotics is like yeah lol
You didn't have the guts to destroy it
GOALS🤘🏽
I really love what this channel has turned into.
Now this man knows how to drive a ferrari. mclaren next ????
THATS WHY HES THE GOATT
Forza in real life
Dudes playing Forza Horizon in real life 😆
Laughed the whole time 🤣🤣🤣 classic WhistlinDiesel content!
Yassss!!
Good ad for the bubble
That's an awesome ad at the end for that bubble product 😂😂😂
This made me smile 😊
Some of the trucks he’s bought couldn’t even go up some of the hills
The pencil at the end I couldn’t stop laughing Lmao!! Can’t wait for part 2
This video was just a bubble sponsor 😂
In my eyes you need to bolt airplane wings on it
Fire video cody
ngl, the end of the video would be an insane clip for their marketing team (for the company that makes the balloon)\
Needs some bullhorns on that hood
Just letting you know at this point every one of your video drops feel like Christmas 😂
Bro is playing BeamNG IRL
This is actually fucking insane 😂
Whoever sold you that car, just lost their job... 😂
Playing Forza Horizon In real life 😂
I love your videos but please it's my favourite Ferrari don't destroy it thx idol
Wow
This is actually happening
The "jerry rigs everuthing" of cars. (I know, this is a lame comment. but I don't give a fuck)  ...and the caterpillar running over this red crap, when?
Just realized Keller is from wildcats channel 🤯
Ooooooohh myyyyyy gaaawddddd
Look bro we get it your rich slap some cgi and Gimme the car 😂😂
you are the HowToBasic of the carworld
Now you need a $1,00,000 trophy truck and a 45ton Volvo to jump
Just curious🤔... Would a Ferrari move a tree out of the road? Like your other red vehicles.
Ferrari should really use this video, as a durability test example for they’re cars.
Best one ever farrari must be pissed
9:40-10:25 i see no reason why ferrari couldnt do rally racing based off how well that car drove off road
Reaper wheels on the rari haha
forza in real life
less go
Where's the case in sticker
Ferrari isn't ever gonna let this man's even see a ferrari
Recreate the fairs bueller scene where they jack the car up and run it in reverse to try and take the miles off the car so the kids dad doesn’t find out, then one of them kicks it and it falls off the jack and rolls off a cliff
Do a Mahindra stress test. They claim to be #No.1
I love the prolonged junk toss.
Becoming DDE.
Can we jus take the time to appreciate how good of a driver whistlindiesel Actaully is
this made me want to buy a ferrari
Best video ever🔥
If he destroys the body he could always just make Leroy’s Italian cousin
PUT THE BUGGIE WHEELS ON IT
Lmao this is one of my favorites now
If we don’t have a car, we don’t have a crime. 🤔
That driving remind me when i was playng GTA !
When you’re doing things like this in exotic cars I really think you need to stop and just embrace that you’re doing GTA shit irl. Lmaooo
honestly nothing better than the hilux durability test. Just do some sick test like that with a land cruiser next time maybe
For sale: Garage kept, adult owned.
Honestly, great idea  but you should upgrade the suspension and put paddle tires on it and bring it to the dunes
The airmags was pushing it but I’m lowkey triggered now
Awesome video!!!!😊😊❤😂
hit a speed bump and use is as a ramp for a dirtbike
Real life forza
This is my new favorite video.
Are we just not going to talk about the muffin pan?
So freakin hilarious 😂
When we adding a lift kit to rally this
While I'm struggling to buy a Mustang Shelby super snake.... This Bastard here Wasting money!!!! 😡😡😡 I'm big mad
That last skit was fucking amazing!!!!!!
Bro is litterally playing GTA5
3:50 Dickari
Dicey vidjya if it was a 360 Modena I would unsub lol
Love the video. This one hurts a little it's my dream car, but by the end guess I will know if it should still be my dream car.
He definitely went broke after this
He thinks he is in the forza horizon😂
The ending on this was gold. I can tell yall had a lotta fun doing that last bit
WD needs to be on top gear.
I ❤️ you bro! Always get excited when you have new vids😁🤣🤣
Start a rumble
Now this was a good video
Destroy it
Red is dead??
Damn, i really enjoyed your channel
He's just playing Forza Horizon in real life. I wish to be that cool some day
One of your best sports car vids, I've totally got a new opinion on Ferraris now. Just needs some winter tires on it!
hey. can i have that air compressor? my f150 gets flats all the time...
I see a 40 series in the background at 1:41
Can I have it when your done with it? That ending was funny as hell
Amazing 😄
i love that he does everything my 15 year old mind would do if i was rich
DDE ❤
That was oddly satisfying.  Thank you for that!
This is your masterpiece man! BRAVO!!! Tears of joy 🥲
Hellcat swap 😂
Thst bubble is mad impressive
It's just a company right off I insist that next time you shoot for something truly irreplaceable. Perhaps a GMC cyclone
Man’s playing forza irl
❤10
I’ll give you 3$ if you let me drive it. Gonna be a check and don’t cash it till Friday.
Cool
I don't know what the problem is, this is probably the best thing I've seen a Ferrari do, they should really be thanking you.
Buggati next
You should put a roll cage in it and start doing rally with it that would be fucking awesome
How long till he gets sued 😂😂
Yes!!
TaxTheRich100 (2.0) -- Yah' know... Lambo makes a model for this... Huracán Sterrato!  Bwhahahah!  Poor Ferrari.  Sorry, but I had to stop the video at the 3000psi power washer, the cringe was just too much for me, lol!
nice
Good. I despise Ferrari's customer support, and this was an amazing way to stick it to them.
Love it 😂
It's not a Ferrari, it's a Whistlin Diesel research project.
good
You forgot the kitchen sink
That cars a beast
your sarcasm and not giving a fk is hilarious.
The shit i used to do on GTA 5 with super cars 🤣 Mount Chiliad vibes
Never disappointed when WD drops a new vid.
Wild 🔥😀 Send love from Indonesian 🇲🇨
That ballon balloon tho..
lmao at the end
That’s somebody’s dream car
Young and handsome billionaire landlord 😳 😍
Thank you for doing good deeds for the world to see, there are starving children less greatful! The pollution Farrari pits out when they speak needs to be stopped. Thank you @whistlindiesel for making me lactate and helping us greatful viewers one video at a time, we love you,  You my friend are a hero to our land! Farreri lambulls need to be taught a lesson. Yee yeee! -Steve
Love your videos, the quality is superb. My nephews love ur videos, never know what's next
This is what I like. Let's hope ferrari loved this
bros playing forza in real life
from 13:18 to about 14:08 we get to see the car barraged by the most random things ever. its almost a minute of pure wd chaos
This would be a good promotional add for that protector company 😂
GTA in real life
This particular blouse, previously worn by Volodymyr Zelenskyy, makes my yummy zone hot. Red hot.
Just a Boring video 🙄🙄
Durability testing in 5…
Finalllyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!! I was waiting the whole week to see it, sadly I hit the like boton but I have to go work, are 6:25 in the morning here in Spain, damn!!!
Ferrari been quite since this video dropped 😂
Imagine a Lamborghini vs Ferrari durability test, that would be sick
i cried while watching this.             (from laughter)
Love this haha keep sending man!!
Reminder: never asked for a hammer in this shop. 🤣🇺🇲🦅
A man buys himself a Ferrari and smiles for some time. Whistlindiesel buys a Ferrari, and millions of people laugh their ass out for a looooong long time 🤣
I’ve been waiting whistlin u take foreveeerrrrrrrr
Bruh the ending had ne rolling🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ok at least he didn’t completely destroy but great video
Ferrari is bulid for dirt and mud
Jfc just throw everything at it 😆
Living Forza horizon's open world in real life
The Ferrari legal was probably waiting for this!
that Bentley in the back, i saw that in real life at the ESSEN Motorshow
There’s Adam LZ’s compound then there’s WhistlinDisel’s 👍🤠
Here we go again
Man whose son are you like seriously dude
They can’t get mad at the tune
Hell yes!!!!!!! F U Ferrari
bro got saul as his lawyer
that was sick. after i bit it started to hurt, but i have never seen someone so reckless with a Ferrari, well done!
Not one real jump...
13:55 YELLLOOOW LAAADER 😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😳
car bubble boy couldn’t have paid for better advertising… I want one
So when is Ferrari giving you the lawsuit?
The bubble sales after this video 📈 that thing actually held up 🤣
I think I broke my jaw from laughing
Feed some people instead ya ball bag
By a military tank and try to destroy the tank and other vehicles u have bought to destroy 💥💥
What up with Ferrari, think they can control what we do with the car we bought with our own money. We bought the car=we own the fucking car Ferrari. Everyone against Ferrari
Bro thought he could fool us with forza gameplay 😂
they should be paying him for the durability test on things they would never test
Lmfao!!!! i fucking loved this video The ending was fucking GOLD LMAOOOOO
Good ad for bubble company
The part of the tools beeing thrown at the car hahaha EPIC xD
Well, you could probably pay for the lawsuit from Ferrari, by making this video into a commercial for the makers of the ''air barrier car protector thingy''.... That thing is the blob!! 🤑
This video is sick bro❤❤❤❤
Picture the troll face grinning with the spike teeth that was me this whole video. I guess the real question is are they going to sue you? 🤔 😀😄😆😂🤣
You should take it back to the Ferrari dealership to get a detail and see what they say😂
This is truly amazing
the comment about the 458 being a broke boy Ferrari is ridiculous, it's probably the best car they've made in the past 20 years
its like he is playing gta 🤣
The Edits got me 💀😂😂😂
Ur gonna get sued 🤣🤣🤣
Lmao 🤣 mannnnn throwing all that randomness including the Traxxas was epic, and as always amazing content, I'm Highly addicted to your videos my dopamine level is FLYING!! Rite now, Ferrari man, damn who would of thought hard work and great ideas 💡 😆
When u done w it let me have it 😅
🤣🤣🤣
bro went Forza Horizon in that car
Forza Horizon IRL
You needed to have dde mess it up
5:59 “They call me the McThick”💀
I was weirdly more OK with you destroying a Ferrari than a Toyota Hilux. I guess maybe it's because I can actually afford to purchase and import a Hilux but I'll never be able or want to purchase a Ferrari.
Can we just appreciate how good this guy is at driving? Any normal person would have killed themselves on that driveway, in the rain, in a Ferrari.
This whole video was gold ! 😂 when the sparks were hittin the gas can 😂😂😂 its the little things in Codys vids
Dad can I get a ferrari
To be honest it's one of the best off-road vehicle I've ever seen
*me watching this before Ferrari makes him take it down*💀😂 I hope that doesn’t actually happen
A very quality machine so fsr
I hope Justin Bieber see this video
were is the Bugatti
Lmfao bro
All that shit flying at the bubble had me dying, good shit bro!
great one cody , i like that car. i was impressed ,  with the cover  😊
cody really doesnt give a fuck lmfao.
my guy is playing forza irl
One day Cody will buy the White House just to torch it..
This actually makes Ferrari look good oddly enough
I honestly expected more from you Cody . I wanted more destruction. Hopefully the next video you will actually destroy it .
Clarkson is so jealous right now
Ferrari rally car racing might now become a thing 🤔😎
Cant tell which I am more impressed with. That bubble is seriously rad lol
Mans at 0:54 went private 😂
mf witterally pwayin forza whorizon
Hay cody.. I loved your video, like always and I was wondering if I would be able to take your Ferrari for  a ride.. I will pay for the ticket and I just want to have some funn.. lol just trying if this works..
The ending was fucking hilarious. Beat the living fuck out of that red pile of shit!
God content gang🔻
I've thought of becoming the Whistline Diesel of the collectible world lol. Pokémon people would implode 😂 .
I wanna see him destroy a supra. Actually v8 swap it and bring it to a jdm car show.
Honda civic would last longer and not write cease and desist
The duke boys are going to be proud
Got me so fucking excited For the Bugatti 😂
You should put that motor into something ridiculous & just mob the hell out of it
Make it a monster truck!
Any one queries of all those boxes
For a second I thought that was a real cat on the ladder.
damn the advertising for that car bubble was amazing.
Ferrari executives watching this are probably LOSING THEIR SHIT lol I love it
Hahaha hahaha hahaha give me a hammer
This is actually a great ad for those car bubbles, i might go get one..
Better than what mr beast does with his money
Make it a tractor
i can smell the lawsuit coming
Love to see it 😂💯
hell yea looked like an rc car ripping around the property lol
uh, how about a balloon for Monster Max 2
Does it ever snow up there
"Quiet down, I'm trying to see where I'm going" 😂
This reminded me of driving a Ferrari like a lunatic on Project Gotham on my Sega Dreamcast when I was a kid!! Thank you for bringing those childhood memories back!!! Smiling the whole time!!!!
What no kitchen sink??
Real life forza
GTA VI looks amazing.
I will personally donate $500 towards putting the ferrari on donk wheels
Sick outfit 😂
The protection bubble company should pay you to use this part of the video as a commercial or something!
Good, I'm glad a Ferrari is getting beaten to piss off Ferrari. Maybe they should let people have fun
Ending was the best! 🤣
How many drift points did you collect 😂 my mans living our dreams
This is Forza in real life
I died laughing at the end 💀💀
Watch out ferrari is probebly gonna sue you
I think they forgot to throw the kitchen sink 😆
When is the durability test on gf video coming?
This is what peak YouTube looks like people.  Take notes
Please don’t destroy it please don’t destroy
This is so  much better than daily driven exotics
What’s the name of that cover ?
ahhahahah so coool
The bubble at the end has me actually dying 😂 I love this guy. Congratulations boys WD has made it
Imagine driving down the road in your Ferrari and someone hits you and totals the car and Ferrari sues you
😂 omg that was the funniest shit I have ever seen when you started throwing shit at the bubble 😂😂😂
Bros driving it likes hes playing forza
hell yeah live your best life bro. Im glad you are showing people that material things literally do not matter, enjoy life!
Too bad it wasn’t a manual
The channel only gets better
pov: ur playing with fire
This childish destruction is getting old. Or maybe its just me
You are a madman
Idk if WD was trying to make a promo video for that car bubble thing, but god damn it turned out that way lol
My dad passed away a few days ago one of the only video he ever watched was your video the fire truck he loved it
I've seen the thumbnail change 3 times before I've even had the chance to watch it.
Sick! Paint it pink now!
How is this not on youtube trending yet......550k views in 5 hours. I smell a conspiracy!!!

Surprised they sold it to you
Only youtuber I watch and gets me excited for new videos
Wonder when the cease and desist letter is coming there.
“can’t afford big boy toys” bro what
Not bad but it's still in one piece. Also gyrocopter is still available at el mirage dry lake ca. Come on by to tadgyro and check it out
Koenigsegg next?
What’s next dropping from a roof?
Man fuck Ferrari for suing like that. If it was my company, I’d by grateful that I’m selling cars for hundreds of thousands and even millions of dollars and not let a stick go up my ass
Oh man was this great!! Absolutely love it brother. Much love and respect from your neighbors in Columbia, TN!!! Keep up the great work.
Lmaooo they not gon like this
Cody needs to do a durability test on the ram trx
Dude now we're talking destroying a Ferarri I love it can i join you i also wanna smash a ferrari up❤
On my next video I will be driving a Ferrari 488 with a tuned and lowered on bags 🔥

I can’t stop smiling!
What radar detector does he use ?
You need to make the horn sound like a duck.
Thank you for driving the car like I would!! I feel like I'm there while watching.
this is why whistlindiesel can't have nice things and keep them that way
Where’s the Bugatti you Brokyyyyy 😎
Yeeaaaaaa😀
I don't know why this makes me laugh so hard.  But it does
Lawsuit incoming in 5 days
This is probably the most exited you've been waiting for mail after this video dropped. Can't wait for the lawsuit follow up.
did a good job with this video
Forza irl
Great video
this foreal a ferrari ad those drifts were sick lol
reminds me of arma 3
Me when I play forza 😂
Watching it being able to rip on the gravel was honestly so Fuckin sick
Ferrari: *sues WD* WD: *squats the Ferrari to send it to the shredder*
If anything he is doing Ferrari a service! 🤣
Porsche gt3rs durability test?
Absolute legend
Crazy how good it did tho
Whistlindiesel is about to create an entire new sport now that everyone can see my these do on actual dirt.  He’s also eventually going to have a montage of him perfectly drifting the entire driveway in gorgeous slow motion, with the lamest rap song over it.   Dudes a killer.
At the end of the video it made me laugh really hard and I haven't laugh like that in while thank you so much whistlindiesel
Been waiting to get off work to watch this
Okay you just hands down sold like a millions of those car bubble protectors for that company lmao
Mental, absolutely mental. But I like it.😁
ATF All Terrain Ferrari
Your the best 🦄💝👊🤠
Destroy? Not so much. Getting soft on us bud?
This has been on my TikTok all day I had to see the full video 😂
Cody driving that Ferrari like he's playing Forza Horizon. Best video yet
The most impressive part about this video...was the bubble. Well played lol
Now Im mad you didn't destroy it
I have to say i enjoy these videos ... but DAMN IT JUST DON'T FEEL RIGHT !
The company that made that bubble shit about to be rich.
cease and desist letters
Lift kit?
When people say "fck you money" they think some rich yuppy in LA...no no, this is fck you money
Should have freed get that hook he threw at ya. Or run into it with the blue f150
I'm not a hater, I actually love the videos, but I don't think I've actually laughed during one of these videos 😕
Ok but the classic cars in the back
I hate u 😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Reminds me of when I’d play Forza horizon!
He should have changed to off road tires to get better handling on dirt, maybe using rally car's tires.
This guy is such a legend
No BS that's the best ad I've ever seen for those car bubbles.  That actually worked alot better than I thought they would.
I love it! You never see a Ferrari driven so carelessly
This is an add for that car protector
Not gonna lie, I'm cringing a bit watching this.  Ha ha.  That air bubble cover worked awesome.
He did it. He really fucking did it
Nigger
Ferrari never gonna sell you another car
I wouldn't do this with the Dr Pepper I just bought. WD=All the balls
F1 car pls
The end killed me like were did he find all that stuff
😅😅 👌...
พี่ชายคนนี้แท้แน่นอน
you should make it pink and yellow and add in black spray paint on the hood i ❤ lawsuits
I wish i could hear the sentence the crew heard that day, which sounded something like ......." hey, do yall wanna throw some wrenches and brooms n stuff at a Ferrari ?" 🤣
I can hear Enzo Ferrari screaming from his grave and I am living for it!
Stance it
I mean comon this should be a Ferrari commercial 😂😂😂
*cease and desist has entered the chat*
TAKE IT BACK TO YOUR OLD PLACE AND DRIVE IT INTO THE BOTTOM LESS MUDPIT !!
Now that’s daily driving a exotic car.  Put that bitch through the extreme and see if it’s worth the money 😂😂
Wrap it to match monstrmax and the audi 😂
Perfect,man😉
I’m impressed with all this 😂😂😂
I was like a lot of the areas look vaguely familiar  just realized it  me and whistling diesel live like an hour apart lol 😂   Your secret Is  safe with me bro 🤜🏻🤛🏻   that’s cool to live that close to such a big YouTube channel I may only be close to 500 but it’s a start It inspires me. And let’s face it we all dream. To do stuff that you do (;
This is the job I want lmfao
I laughed that whole video! Such a good example of a caring car owner
✌🏽😎
You screwed up bud. The last thing thrown should have been the kitchen sink. You will have to do the video over now. Fire your creative director immediately.
What’s In the crates
😂 this video was amazing
WATCHING THIS NOW BEFORE IT GETS DELETED.. IF IT DOES
Do a video with a tesla, just make sure the battery dont blow up
Cease and desist letter coming in the mail 😂
Hell of an ad for the bubble
Thumbs up for that ending
That bubble can definitely survive a nuclear blast, and if not you should sue them
My face hurts from smiling so much, the ending was hilarious
Next video April 1st Ferrari durability test
Splashing and defacing a Ferrari.  That's a class double D Mr. Meaner offense
I was supposed to fold clothes and play video but instead I just watched 😂 one of my favorite video
I'd be down to buy a piece of scrap Ferrari, see how the Ferrari legal team likes that one
What’s the point of this? Views? You are living a life of luxury. For what?
God… he should be exempt from taxes…
You literally deserve every car u get
I think first. Time i can say dope plug-in a legit connect an review bubble works lol
One of the best videos yet
Boring content
I’m calling it now WD will die before he turns 30 😂
Commenting for more horse googly eyes
Better be getting some sponsorship money from that bubble company cause this is the best marketing video they are ever gonna get, also really surprised how well the car is  handling all that.
Enzo is pissed
So who's gonna clean up that mess?????? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
A. Kougias enter the chat
😂
Before you start putting these cars through the whistling diesel tests.   To make someone’s dream you should raffle a driving experience for your subscribers it would inspire people
Did anybody else laugh the part where he threw a whole bunch of things when he just asked for a hammer 💀
Gangster asf!! Loved this!!
Ferrari is so upset right now they don't even know how to respond yet! This is by far the best one yet! Can't wait to see you sheep herd and cattle chase with this!
Now thats how you drive a Ferrari cx
Money well spent , have fun with it
Hes driving how i drive n forza games
Bro made it look like Forza horizon 😂
I love the transitions in the edits smooth
this is gold, i cannot hold it together lmaoooo

Best ending to a video ever
I see all those other cars 😏
Man Ferrari is lucky he went easy on it this time 😂😂
I feel a court case coming on.
He just made a whole legal team get divorced.
haha slightly used in the ad when for sale
Dont tell youre destroying it just say youre testing it😂
Not gonna lie that stupid car bubble held up better than I thought it would…but it’s red so there’s no hope 😂
this man needs to get a kownigsegg NOW!!!!
Driving in the rain...just did something 99% of Ferrari owners have never done!
Talk about marketing for that bubble tho 🤣 they gonna call you up and ask to use this video to promo their bubble protector 🤣🤣🤣
lol you guys are crazy i love all your friends
Only a matter of time before WhistlinDiesel buys Stradmans Buggati Veyron.
Thank you so very much for that belly laugh you gave me at the end of the video.
So painful to watch but so fuckin amazing at the same time😭
Fun thing is he ferrari black lists people💀 i think whislin diesel might get black listed for this, keep up the good work and thanks for making these awesome videos for us
This man is unstoppable.
I love it 🎉
Totally awesome man just can't wait to see you destroy it!!
Somehow each video keeps getting better and better!
Real life gta
I’m so proud of you you got to the point we’re you can durability test a Ferrari
That S duct up front on the car took in more shit than your ears did from your crazy aunt last family christmas get together
dude im so suprised that thing could make it up that hill, my truck couldnt even make it up that crazy slope
Cody, the fact that you now have enough money to make this happen.. It's pretty incredible, regardless of what anyone has to say.  Well done, well, fuckin' done.
This exact video is what I subscribed to the channel for 3 years ago. I knew it was coming someday
honestly you sold me on that bubble
The end of this video was hilarious 😂😂 and pretty impressed with the car, definitely is a rally car for sure
"We are so getting sued!"   And that's one of many problems with America
3:30
Next you you buy a multi million dollar mansion then set it on fire 🔥
The ending was hilarious with the constant flow of items haha!

Bro needs to recreate the 2 fast to furious scene when he smashes the window in the ferarri
Me every time i hop on Forza
How my car be on gta😭
That bubble at the end is insane. I hope this car genuinely sticks around on the channel because this was hands down one of the best videos yet other than the G wagon test videos. Awesome stuff Cody
Seeing him do the stupid little things is mildly infuriating.
Send me the Ferrari air compressor since you hate it so much.
Best car bubble commercial ever.
Bro woke up and chose f8 rally car
YOU ARE A TOP G
والله انه ساطي 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I saw this and clicked faster than Ferrari can file a lawsuit.

Way to stay true to your channel. Love it. Also, truly learning not to be so materialistic myself.
First time seeing your videos, I have to say you just made my day😂  Also can I have the car after your done with it. Thanks
8:27 your metaverse uber arrives as scheduled
I honestly feel like this is art. Kinda feel like it’s a screw you to rich folks in weird way
0:00

Died laughing at the end with all the objects thrown at the bubble. Impressed with the car’s power up the hill and off road capabilities 😂👏🏻
Amazing
That rari sound clean asf tho
You’re crazy bro !

The ending is one of the best things of all time
Seems like you could actually store the water bottle in the S duct, since there's not much storage space anywhere else

All the haters need to leave bc whistlindiesel risks his life every single day just to make videos for people like me who luv him and luv to watch him, y’all haters are just jealous bc he’s good in life and doesn’t have any drama, and makes so much money off YouTube. So people who want drama and are gonna hate.. LEAVE!!!!stfu and leave Cody alone Love ya Cody

You should send it back too Ferrari tell them how much you enjoy their product!
Bros playing Forza IRL
Loved Seth's "oh nooo.." when he took off the cover🤣
i cant be the only one who cringed many times during this video.
Epic MF!!!🔥🔥
Fuck Ferrari
Such a nice car, I'd love to have an F8 or 488 Pista someday. Congrats on the purchase!🙌
I haven't laughed so hard in a long time I appreciate that 😆 😂 😅
What a time to be alive
I love you
The joy this brought me today 🥰
I remember a long time ago he posted a video about exhaust car jack and he said that that would be the last time a car would be on his chin now you rarely see a truck
I love it! Smile on my face the whole time! Somehow I feel like a Ferrari is a great purchase now and want one this much more!
Can I have the seats  when your done
This is exactly how I drive my Ferrari in video games😂❤
If I had enough money, I would do this too hahahah
Man’s just playing gta in real life
F you money well spent 🤙 the destruction standards are now at an Italian quality high.
Will dde buy it lol
This one's gonna hurt me, but oh well time to see what a Ferrari can handle.
Can’t believe this guy went from destroying 80s and 90s shit boxes to $400,000 Ferraris
I'm disappointed no KITCHEN SINK?
Incredible, I've been looking forward to this
Actually impressed. This seemed to hold up quite well and pretty capable.
Need to turn it into a squatted truck…
Forza Horizon 5 IRL
Has Ferrari said anything to you yet? 😂
Ferari 🆗
This is great fun to watch but i cant help but to cringe bc of mechanical sympathy
I loved this video so much i turned off my add blocker just to support it.
Can't wait for the chopper drop hahahaha
I really want one of those bubbles now
You should buy a dirt car and see if you can even drive I personally don’t think you have any driving skills   You even live out east lots of tracks but you like to just fart around  you’re a cancer
I'm sold on the bubble.
Still think that his old any level lifted ford he had was the longest to survive besides the helux. This is awsome
You done and outdid yourself once again Sir 😅
Bruh that was Salmon!
Manz literally plays forza in real life
Lawl
does youtube really allow you to pay for all of this? wow
that bubble impressed me more than anything
Bro is turning in to @taxtherich100
Bros playing forza horizon 4 irl 💀
I’m glad it’s not just a cars and coffee car
anyone notice all the military crates in the background lol? hes got sokething up his sleeve\
YES YES YES oh yeah I beat fluidium
He made more in 3 seconds then I make in an hour.
I could care less if anyone doesn't like what I have to say. It pisses me off that this caliber of car and he treated it like crap damaging it most likely to the thousands of dollars. Painting those cars isn't cheap and he probably damaged other things while standing on the vehicle and jumping up and down on it and throwing things at it which did hit it on the side even though the top was somewhat protected. Driving it around the field is ridiculous. But it's just like a kid at Christmas that gets too many toys they don't appreciate them and then they end up trashing them because they have no respect for what they have. So many of his viewers will never have a car of that caliber in their entire life and that's a fact. Just to see one get driven on videos is a thrill sometimes and this is what he did with his? This guy's a POS and I have no respect for him at all. Any self-respecting car guy would have never done that at all ever in their life. But then he's not a self-respecting car guy is he?  SMH💩💩💩💩💩  And by the way if you think I'm going to get into some online pissing contest about it and what I think about him and what he did to that car think again because I really don't give a damn. Say anything you want to say but I'm not replying to a single thing on this. I'm just angry beyond words about it.
will you be doing a durability test on the mustang 2024??
This is harder to watch than the shoes… 🫣
cease and desist incoming
INSANE
Been waiting for this. What other car you going to demo derby it with. Which dies first the Ferrari or his lambo? Cage and rage!!!! Fueled by haters finally getting my sub!!!!
It needs to be catapulted down the hill with a medieval trebuchet!
At 18 cents per view Cody just made more in 5 hours then I make in 2 years, $100,000.
Guys we all know what the next test car is to be after this the Bugatti
Brings back old WD vibez 🙌🙌🙌
Streetspeed: watch me offroad this C8  Whistlin: hold my beer
You're mad! ❤️💯
13:15 that should be the promo video for that product
oh please put a lift kit on it but make it have that squat where it looks like its ass is dragging the ground.
This is the nicest you've ever been to a vehicle
Do you think he’s gonna get a ceist and desist from Ferrari?
If you’re destroying Ferrari’s like this, then I would like to get a car to go to school💀.
This reminds me of the way I drive in forza 😂 good stuff
ok, but whats next? I'd like to see some magnum PI ferrari helicopter action. Can you grow a Tom Selleck mo?
No one on the face of this earth tops this channel… PROVE ME WRONG 🤘🏻
Badass car collection
Can’t even trust the damn ladders at that shop
I wish he didn’t wait so long to post. He could be bigger then most and buy more toys 😅
Y’all got a like and subscribe to this man he’s going to need more money to buy stupid shit to destroy
What no DDE…. will buy it when your dun haha
Dude didn’t even break it fully like he would with a truck
Мммм хуета
hes definitly getting sued
Can I get 15k so I can get out if debt should have put more skill points into luck. Humans destroy enough. Please stop wasting valuable resources for views and viewers stop encouraging the destruction of perfectly functional items 😑
😂😂😂😂😂the ending
I can never get enough WD content
God that thing sounds sick
The whole video was an ad for that fucking bubble thing
Pov 2040: remember when cody sent a buggati off a hill to ensure it was safe enought for people who dont drive right
Nice vette
Once known as WhistlinDiesel, now known as WhistlinAnything&Everything, you’re incredible man we applaud you👌🏼
I was waiting for a kitchen sink to come flying in last. That was funny shit right there. Ferrari should have you do a commercial for them lol. Excellent video Cody keep it coming.
No 🐈 here on this channel. Lmao
I approve this message
Hell yeah !! 🔥 keeping the haters happy!!!! WD 4 prez!!!
Gta🤣🤣
Best video to date
The lambo cover got me 😂😂😂😂😂
This is the Ferrari video I have been waiting for!!
That car actually looks sick, but I cannot wait to see it get destroyed
WD is the GOAT
I was dying laughing at that bubble scene lmao!!!
Enzo Ferrari is turning in his grave rn 😅
Ferrari isn't gonna send you a lawsuit for this video, its just enough to make them piss their little panties and hide in their office closets crying in sheer agony! I APPROVE THIS VIDEO!!!!
Not even getting 100k views an hour! It should be way higher....
Who knew a Ferrari in the the county hills would sound so good
Wow to bad I have school today
We need to see you jump this at streetspeeds field
Should collabed with #dailydrivenexotic damon fryer show ya what that cars got
Holey shit this is funny
Squat it 😈
THIS IS THE BEST AD I HAVE EVER SEEN FOR A FERRARI AND THE PROTECTION BUBBLE
Give me a Hammer - That got me laugh so hard 😂
I watched twice tonight, Im watching again before bed and at least 10 times tomorrow
Didn't he previously say he hated red
Uhhh. Time to buy stock in the bubble thing!!!
enzo ferrari its crying in his grave

Bhahahaahaha the bubble actually did really good!
thanks WHISTINLINDESEL FOR BRINGING GTA TO REAL LIFE
dde needs to come run this with u lol
Man is a true pioneer that Ferrari just endured more in 14 min than any Ferrari ever. Wouldn't be surprised to see a demand in the sieze amd assist letter for that footage to be used in Ferrari commercials coming soon lol.
3:19
Still laughing!
13:20 When a kid tells the teacher they forgot he homework:
Ya that was nothing don’t worry Ferrari there a lot more 😅😂❤❤❤
He’s really out here driving like me in gta
Ok throwing the crutch at the bubble wrapped car was funny lol
I fucking hate Ferrari so destroy the fucking thing
How does Whistlin afford this shit?
No one: Forza horizon 5: "I destroyed a $400,000 Ferrari"
Good video Daniel!
Very expensive experiment , original entertainer 😂😂😂
Whats with all the green plastic military camera boxes at the end of the video stacked up to the ceiling
I like how he always has his little nut rider crew around
I love this 😂😂
Hill climb champion 2023
Shit DDE didn't care. They twin turboed an f12. Sticking out the hood too. With Gintani upgrades too. And they even said that they are waiting for an order from Ferrari to stop. So, this will be interesting. Who gets one first? You or DDE.
This guys got a bad ass land cruiser in the garage
Perfect video doesn’t exi…… 😂😂😂😂
😂⚰️💀
Ferrari wanted level the world has officially been completely influenced to be irl gta
Love ya work WD and crew
This guy doesn’t have boundaries and i love it
Beautifully done
Bro your content something serious 😂🔥💯
The king 🤴 of content! Never a dull moment!
That’s actually incredible promo for the bubble cover company
🙈
I’m sorry but if you don’t like this man I’ll put a bounty out on you cause this man is a legend😂😂😂 keep it up Cody love this shit
triggered supahcar fanboi noises incoming
Shadow ban…..I never got the notification for this video.

Dudes playing forza horizon
Honestly can’t wait for the next part, you keep out doing yourself with every video, where will it end? Keep it up brother.
Great vid man (comment so algorithm shares it more)
Buy stradman's bugatti and do a durability test
I call dibs on the first jar of Ferrari mulch
ONLY WHISTLIN DIESEL!!
Cody is the ABSOLUTE greatest force of destruction to ever live…NEVER STOP
spacers and forces/mudders
Dude is playing real life forza
I have not been more excited for a video in my life and I was not let down 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
genius
Crazy Redneck MoFu........Love it
Extremee broh🔥🔥
I'm gonna lie. I hate all your videos and I haven't even seen them. Jokes aside now that you have some super cars I'd love to see a colab with you and DDE!!
Ferrari is, yeah, impressive, but can we just take a moment to appreciate how well that bubble thing worked and held up.
Besides the boring nature of this video what's more sad is the amount of people in the comments that are that impressed by some things getting thrown
Driving that thing like forza but in real life
This is what we all do on Forza 😂😂
the last part of this video was so satisfying to watch
I thought he was actually gonna take it through the valet while covered in mud lmao
The Bubble God
You know what really gets to me.. When people try and scam me while I can barely even feed myself, let alone pay for any expenses in my life.
Now full disclosure,Ferrari did build the 288 GTO to go group b rallying but modern ones aint up to that
Hilarious
Technically you showed the ferrari’s performance on dirt so your safe in this video
i hate it cause i dont have it but if i did.....id be doing the same shit lmao
SOOOOOO EXITING!!!!!! Can’t wait for the next video Cody!!!!!
Real life Forza 😂
This straight up looks exactly like me driving in Forza Horizon 5 and spinning out in dirt when it's raining lol
Charles LeRedneck
The bubble was funny and effective
I fucking love this!!
I’m not gonna lie like I was happy when there sued that cat poptart thing it looked like shit an which brand would honestly want their car rolling around looking like shit 😂😂😂
💯✌️ Bro love it 🤙
Ferrarichat is is full meltdown..i love it
The company def making that ending into an add lmao
Yeah, I needed that one after today. Try not to cry after he says I need a hammer… your going to?
Doug DeMuro car review 2.0
The amount of military boxes is crazy😂
I lost it at the Doug DeMuro clip 😂😂😂
Make a squatted Ferrari, so you can have an actual excuse to destroy it
If you think whistlindiesel is actually good at driving a Ferrari off road 👇
destroy it more you did nothing to the car you need to destroy it for real
Be like fh5 in real life.
pov my dreams
you are a god among men
I hope ferrari sues you!!!!
Cody is the problem child Enzo wanted 😂
Dear society. This is how expensive vehicles should be used. Not stored and hidden away in a garage
I wonder what ever happened to Epic Meal time?
Love this guy and everything he does
bros playing forza irl
500k views in 5hrs just to watch him destroy and waste $ I’m not watching 😢
Congrats to the people who watched it before the lawsuit
You guys are insane and I love it 🦅♥️
Bro playing GTA irl
i get that it's his car and he can do what he wants with it,but if the Ferrari legal team doesn't send in the sicilian mafia after you,i'm going to be surprised. Personally I don't agree with the abuse of the car from the general disfiguring of the car.it's this type of general pattern of behavior that makes companies like Ferrari make you buy multiple cars in order to get the limited run ones(at least brand new)
For everything you've ever done I hate you so much for hurting this Ferrari but I respect you so much more
Next video: Ferrari sent me a lawsuit
cant wait to see cody play with the excavator again...
Absolutely beautiful ❤ love the off road
Cease and desist incominggg!!!!
You can tell he hates Ferraris but was still so gentle with it
Most of the time im fine with watching him destroy things, but this one was surprisingly entertaining but also painful at the same time. I loved it.
god damn that sounds great.
He’s literally putting all those horses in the pasture… Literally 😂
Congrats to Cody? How about congrats to us for watching the videos and buying merch!
The real top gear at its finest 🔥😎
Lawsuits against people like you
You Through everything but the kitchen sink as a bubble .I like how you do your duality test
I hope this thing is going to be skipping across a corn field!!
I would love to come hang with you guys for a day. It would be an epic day for sure
Lmfao ❤️🤣🤣 hell yeah
Fk yeah shit all mylife wanted to do this shit 💯🤜🤛🌴🌴
forza horizon 6 looks awesome
From a jeep on a rock to a Ferrari just absolutely shredding
What is with all of the military comm gear in the back lol i see WSM LSM and some LEMs
Can’t wait for the next video. 😊
Man you crazy
Should of threw the hilux at it
I do this in Forza all the time 😂
400k dollar ferrari, video has 400k views, and the video was posted 4 hours ago (14,400 seconds)... that's a lot of 400's
🤣🤣🤣 Ferrari gonna be pissed lmao I can't wait for part 2🤣🤣🤣
Rather than a cease and desist Mabey they’d be better off to  buy the car back at twice the price before things get worse 😅
Forza Horizon but make it real life.
Love watching keep it up👍
Always edited to see the videos 😂😂😂
So... Did you get sued?
This video answered a lot of questions, but left a lot too. What the hell are in all those boxes stacked against the wall ?😂😂
POV: you're a guy that play forzahorizon
Everyone in the comment section are NPCs

Waiting on the Bugatti
Ferrari:    Cody: yes
This is what I live for.
Whats with all the SWAN Satellite/Comms/DDSM gear boxes in the background...?
You should have videoed the guys throwing the stuff at the end, and put it on a Patreon I would subscribe to see that!
Best channel ever by far, love you vids man.
I like using my Ferrari has a beater
Lmfao
It's simply, if I can't have the Ferrari then you can't have it either.
Amazing
Oh to see monster max drive over it.
I almost cried watching this, yet I couldn't turn away.
Damm I’ve been recycling cans and bottles and saving all my change just too fix my failing ball joints on my Toyota tundra.. And your over here beating the shit out of a 400,000 dollar car this is just awesome. Keep up the greatest videos on earth Whistlin Diesel
Bro this is what I picture forza horizon irl
the car screaming beautifully even when he’s running for his life
I hope there's a part 2 on this!
I thought it was gonna be already destroyed at 00:02
That lambo cover on it had me cracking up
I want to come America and see this dude its like my brother
i love this channel sm
Hahahahaha all that shit being thrown had me dying laughing. 😂😂😂😂
not going to lie...this gave me so much joy.
The next day “what happened to all my money (Cody ) “something came in the mail (mom)
Cease and decist speedrun
Your videos always and I mean always make me laugh
bro where does he work at
Yea fuck them you paid all that money it's now urs why tf does it matter wat u do to it
Why does a 400k Ferrari not have led headlights
You should take a ford tractor and run that pos over!
Boring
This would be the sickest rally car build of all time
Awesome! I was waiting for the kitchen sink. Only thing that could make it any funnier.
This man plays Forza Horizon Irl
What an amazing grand finale video Cody produced for us. May his channel live on after Ferrari unalives him. 2-19-23 will go down in history.
"...in 1957 FERRARI presented itself at the Verona Fair with its first agricultural machine: the two wheel tractor MC 57." Something tells me this Ferrari of yours has more than enough PTO power to test out all the implements!
Already excited for a part 2
I love this guy 😂
Next Bugatti
i got a good laugh from this like all your videos thanks
Bro I have to meet you one Day lol you funny asf 😂
Cody is actually a pretty good driver lol
Fuck it up more
What's the updates with the splashing court battle?
You should Cummings swap it
thank you cody, for giving no fucks and making the content the world needs rn
Me in Forza:
Forza Horizon IRL
Bro what is in all those cases on the wall?!
I'm just wondering wtf is in all the boxes behind the Ferrari at the end tbh... 🤔
this is the way cars should be advertised lmao
I can wait until I’m Whistling Diesel rich to buy Ferrari’s to driver like a Honda
Ferrari's legal team won't sue because they all had heart attacks or strokes by watching this video.
That bubble is like your Ferrari lawsuit insurance policy
The lambo and the Ferrari need to have a tug of war😂
The car bubble was the definition of tiktok made me buy it😂😂
Bubble cover company gonna be the ones taking you to court now🤣
But what's the towing capabilities of that wing?
Man’s playing forza in real life 💀
Bro's just living in GTA irl
whistlinDiesel  gonna be on there do not buy list too
This is great man! Had me ballin when throwing all that stuff at the car at the end. I was expecting a fire extinguisher but no one threw one
YES
Looks like the Porsche Dakar has some stiff competition
I was fully expecting a sink to come flying into frame.
More pls more!!!!
The god of youtube is back
This Man right here. has built and designed and shaped a very rare beautiful, exciting, butthole clinching artform That's  impossible to recreate or duplicate in any way other than his own. Thank you for creating and building the art that is known  as the Whistlindiesel YouTube channel. Lol you are loved  by million for good reason but  only could've been created by my man's Cody lol.  you are  the true  chaotic  genius that will forever be copied but  never duplicated. And for that, you earned everything that has came into your life hoss! Please keep up your amazing art that you have built Cody ❤️
I gotta lie, I’m not impressed
That bubble is insane
This Ferrari means nothing to me 🇺🇸
You're going to blacklisted😂
🎉
This is why i don't like this guy. He's always destroying shit. ITS LIKE HE DOSENT HAVE ANY GOOD IDEAS TO MAKE CONTENT. HES LIKE I SUCK AT MAKING CONTENT, SO ILL JUST DO THE SAME SHIT EVERY TIME. YOU'RE  LAME BRO!!! SHITS NOT COOL!!!
I wonder if you could fit two Priora inside that bubble.
I have been waiting forever now is the day!!!!!!!
Street speed jumps a c8. Cody. “Hold my beer”
Not sure how many folks were used to yeet shit at the bubble. But, bravo. Also, excited to see how much hate you get from the Ferrari community lol. This should be good.
Bro is playing forza Horizon 5 irl🤣
Watching this was entertaining and painful at the same time... lmfao
Will I get sued for liking this video? Low key that was entertaining 🫢🤫
That's a top quality video keep it up dude 🤟
🤣🤣
fucj yeah  fuck ferrari
WhistlinDiesel has the best videos ever made #F#CKTHEHATERS
Red is dead!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@ferrari
This is basically Forza Horizon IRL.
I wonder if it can jump monster max
@ferrari
Damn that bubble thing probably the most robust thing you’ve tested besides the Hilux 🤣
thanks this video inspired me to destroy any ferrari i see
living like forza irl
That was great, from the off-roading to throwing everything at it. I thought you were going to jump on the trunk; maybe next time. Thank you for making me laugh, I really needed that.
*kanye west- jail starts playing in the background*
This video better be #1 on trending.  Edit: Pin this please
POV playing forza
I see a lot of 911's in the background, and I am extremely concerned for their futures Cody.
😆🤣🤣😂ICantfuknbreathe
LIFT IT!! haha
I can only imagine the face of the Ferrari executives waking up and seeing this video😂
best video so far😂❤❤
The subtle Doug demuro reference after he popped up in a Doug demuro video is fucking perfect 😂
Using the Lamborghini Huracan wrap to unveil it and then spitting on the logo after drawing a dick on it before torturing the car off road would've made Ferrucio Lamborghini proud. Straight up poetic
This guy called me poor in all the languages in the world😭I love it 👌🏽🔥🔥
When he is jumping on the car at 10:13 it sounds like the pixar lamp😂😂😂😂
What The FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK,   YOU HAVE Napoleon Dynamite On Your TEAM WTF SINCE WHEN ? 😳 Please tell me kip & uncle Rico And Pedro go over from TIME TO TIME. ⏲️ 🙏
Just leave me a car
Man! I need to buy a F8 now as a ranch vehicle
Where’s the rolls Royce video?
Been waiting weeks for you to upload another video WD !
Stance the shit out of it !!!! widebody with 3pc wheels - 200 camber all around
Bros taken the forza portal
That was the funniest 50 seconds of my life🤣
Have fun doing all that shit because life ends up being to short  !
mans really playing forza irl
Bro is playing forza in real life 😂
Ferrari just hanged them self after watching this video. I don’t care. I love this 😂
Not gonna lie, that's probably your funniest video yet. I had the dumbest smile on my face the whole time, but when yall started throwing shit at the car in the last two minutes I was laughing the whole time. Thank you for the content!
That was incredibly impressive actually
Thin u make twice the moeny back y can't I do what u do wtf🤑🤑🤑🤑
I fucking love this guy haha
Coolest video on YouTube. I wish I could be around for one minute
Threw the garage sink at it.
Man the build up to the Bugatti is getting real boys! The vehicles get more and more expensive as each video goes.
That was epic diesel lol especially the endless bar-rash of items being thrown at the China 🇨🇳 bubble lol 😎👍🏻🇺🇸🦅
I just love how Cody ""mildly torture tests"" things that people find valuable, like steam rolling Nike airmaxs and hill climbing a half million dollar car. Keep liven the dream buddy I am extremely jealous of how much fun you have😂.  Keep on not giving a crap about fancy stuff👍👍😅
This is just awesome 😂
This video is freaking hilarious
Genuinely excited about seeing how the Ferrari stacks up to the real life test!!!  That bubble is IMPRESSIVE!  Where is it sold?
If you have the money to buy one Ferrari could careless what you do with it. I'm just guessing but..........
Buy a 911 Dakar
LMFAO the endless stuff getting thrown at the car condom had me 💀
Strait gold!!!!😂😂😂❤❤❤
The bubble protection seller should make you their brand ambassador
If there's no lawsuit, i bet the Ferrari will not come out in one piece
I can't wait to see Ferraris response to this video and all the people who shelter them in garages instead of driving them.
Can you do a cement truck next?
me in forza lol
That car capsule is impressive as hell
Forgot the kitchen sink
This is a man living one of my “Unrealistic Bucket-List” items.
400'000 my a*** u lied to us 😔
Hahaha the end was so funny, he had to have had a thousand people throwing his whole shop at the car 🤣
This was awesome. That car is very lite so I’m sure that’s why it handle off road pretty well.
Tabarnak!!
I don't even know you personally, and my comments don't matter, but my first words when I saw this was "oh Cody you did not...."
forza irl
When I get an expensive car, I’m getting the bubble for sure!  Great ad !
This is truly a you tube masterpiece .Definitely going to break the internet with this one 🤘🤣👍
EPIC
WhistlinDiesel is out here doing what we can only imagine to do in a video game
Literally real life Forza horizon
Im pretty sure when Ferrari sees this they wont let you buy any and if you maybe buy Ferrari from anyone you might get sued lol
Awesome video
im worried about his financial decisions
An absolute legend.
I’m promoting my music. But, I’m willing to bet that no one will like any of the last 5 songs I’ve wrote, played, recorded, and posted here. I don’t mean like as I’m click like. I mean actually like the music and in listen to them / add them to your play list.
Red
Good car
Unreal ending
Where is the sink? You threw everything else...
This is fucking Legendary
This is sweet. This makes me laugh!
real life gta
The horse cock had me laughing the entire video 🤣🤣🤣
Car reviewing on a another level 🤣😅
just wait until he goes to wash the car and the paint just chips right off. Every new car has such thin, water-based garbage paint, especially from ferrari
Cool if I buy your Ferrari with Monopoly money?
YESSSSSSS 😂😂😂😂
Lol
In the comment section before this video has to be taken down due to Ferrari being assholes.
Once you get down to that level of humor this video becomes the best of all time
Cody you threw everything but the kitchen sink at it!! Come on thought you would threw everything at it 🤣🤣🤣
13:17 this footage is pure advertisement potential for the bubble
Where do I buy the bubble?
He is the guy that can do everything we've ever thought of...
this video had me grinning the entire time, 12:13 in particular got me more than i feel it should have 😂
Me on forza horizon 5 😂👌
this is probably the best video iv ever seen on the tube
Bro he lives in Forza
Can I have a piece of it once it is in many little pieces. Please and thank you
This is why everyone will remember your name
“more money than common sense” - 🤓
whole video was funny but last part was like a cherry on top legendary video hahahaha
Choke on Trumps dick scumbag. You right wing assholes are the worst existence in all of humanity. STOP THE STEAL!!!
Can you buy me a car please.. I’ve been struggling my whole life I wish I can have gotten a dream car for highschool graduation it was back in 2018 and still haven’t gotten a dream car
This is the s**t I do in Forza
Just dont touch the f40...
goat
When you have five stars in GTA 😂
Saw y’all driving the Huracan and the Ferrari down West End in Nashville earlier this week, and I knew the vid was going to be 🔥🔥
Reminds me of the old “Tax the rich” videos
Take it back to Ferrari and ask for a refund
Please Don't,,Hurt the pony car.
TRX durability test 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Epic content as always Cody😂😂😂😂
Ferrari is lucky he took it easy on the car :)
How great would it have been if the pencil at the end stabbed a hole and deflated the whole thing!
See this is what I don't get andrew Tate's Bugatti offroad video going completely viral but this Ferrari is actually going offroad without nearly as many views
me in forza:
Imagine they shoot an RPG at the end LOL 💀
I cant watch
That was the best. The ending was perfect 🤣🤣🤣 was there a kitchen sink thrown too.
Raging 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
it hurts me
You’re the modern day Gallagher
I seen the stuff animal laughed loud asf  💀
That bubble company better have paid you for this ...
This is an art work lol
I love your YouTube videos
I came for the Ferrari. I stayed for the destruction.
The end was giving me serious wrench fight nostalgia
13:20 when cartoon characters are looking for a 10mm
It’s surprisingly way more capable than a G wagon.
Nice good job
massive balls
It’s like forza (the game) irl😂
when is nascar durability test
I wish we could see a video of Ferrari employees reacting to this!
He's literally playing forza horizon with 400k car. 7:44 Reminds me when i'm drifting in the fields in Forza Horizon to not lose my streak.
Yessssssss!!!!!!!! I'm on board with this Bro! If I had extra disposable income, my dream would be to vlog about the experience of daily driving a Ferrari. Area I live in, all 4 seasons, and yes, Ferrari would be the only option.
I actually want that bubble thing
This video was excellent and the final minute was literally art.
The  in there with all those tools and normal items you'd find in a garage 🤣🤣
I love how he keeps the hilux around. Enough said.
11k for a window????
That car is still used🥱
Hands down best WD video of all time. 🙌🙌
What are all those cases for in the background?
Having a property with that much driving potential is actually fucking sick
Sad! Why not use it help the homeless or a needy family or hey heres one for you you little entitled punk maybe help out some needy veterans that help make this country what it s so little jerks like you can waste money right in people’s faces. It’s because of them that you are free to be an idiot on tv for all to see.
Would you look at that 🤩 it does offroad better than my audi q5 🥲
Ok, hear me out, a mild lift (8 to 12 inches, nothing too big), sand paddles, take the ferrari to the dunes and see how it does.
Hahaha probably one of the greatest videos by far😂😂
Now thats a lot of damage... DO more
this car just needs to last a couple more videos before it gets to go on a helicopter ride 😎
Even my 4 month old enjoyed the video😂
Gta real life
Holy shit I was cackling when you edited in Doug Demuro's "THIS"
This is the best video I have seen in a minute
From destroying silverados to destroying ferraris. I fucking love you
what an amazing video.
bro playing gta5 irl
That Chinese spy balloon ain’t so bad after all 😂
He’s just playing forza irl at this point😂
What's next🤔🤣

They should be buying this footage from you for the next commercial 😂😂
BEST VIDEO I'VE SEEN ON YOUTUBE SO FAR THIS YEAR
I was in tears laughing the whole balloon part. Can't wait for more.
We need the angle of yall chucking the shop at the bubble 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That’s the most beautiful Ferrari I’ve ever seen
Pimp
That car sounds awesome 👍

Nice
Forza horizon real life 🤝
11:06 5minutes after eating Taco Bell

Legend 👈💪🇺🇸
All the poor nerds crying right now 😂
Who knew the Ferrari could rally! Put a light bar and some bigger tires on it!
That was great entertainment, thank you.
Gift it tarvish after so he can “revive” the aftermath
Forza GPS: turn left  Me: goes cross country Forza GPS: make uturn when possible Me: continues to cross country
does anyone else watch the entire ads so he makes more money and buys cooler stuff?
Whats with all dem ammo cases. You goin duck huntin er somethin
Hopefully Monster Max eats it for lunch when you're through with it.
I didn't happen to see a kitchen sink thrown at the end, I'm not convinced the bubble is even THAT durable. Gotta try again...
“Honey, wake up WhistlinDiesel posted”
This video makes me want to buy a Ferrari
Dude is living Real life forza horizon
4.67M subscribers to watch an idiot tear stuff up. Where has this society gone?
thank you for the laughs. much appreciated
Can you send me the car to Puerto rico after you break it ?
The ending by far my favorite lol
good on him for finally sticking it to fiat or Ferrari what ever it is
Should of had cleetus put it through its paces, he breaks everything! Would make a good segment
“I think that went well, toss me a hammer” *every item in shop magically relocates to the Ferrari*
Can you try to post more videos. Cause you tubes getting lame and your the only good one
Horse cock
This is like forza horizon IRL 😂💀
Love it keep up the good work
Why
Cody is literally playing Forza with his Ferrari in his back yard 🤣. That’s fucking awesome
Bro is playing Forza in real life. 😂
What, no anvil thrown at the bubble??
Sick video
impressed how well it handled off-road. I hope you take more luxury/super cars off-road
strange ending amazing editing
4:52 The description says probably going to kill turbos lmao they knew what they were doing when they sent that tune
Ferrari lawsuit incoming
Me on Forza 😁
For those that will never experience how was the pull back in the seat?
Does anybody else wonder what’s in all the military crates in the back ground of his garage
This car sounds so rowdy 🤤🤤 on redline
Before you drive a tank over it hit me up, always wanted to drive these! :P
I can't wait for the Bugatti durability test
shits getting old as f@@#$ just came to comment
Working his way up to that Bugatti test!
bro playing gta in real life.
forza irl
The chinese spy balloon website running a sale on white ones🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I own a Red 2004 Honda S2000 I bet it would hold up better and longer then the laflerrari
Hey what’s up bro how are you much love
Man idc what anyone says. Picking up this car, drifting it down your mile long driveway, off-roading it like it’s a 98 civic is mama i made it material. Lmfao who woulda thought. congrats on everything g.
GTA5 in real life
Damn, who knew Ferraris could hill climb? 👍
Had more fun with this than monster max 😔
What I’m the world is that bubble is made out of?? Jeeez congrats Cody can’t wait to see all the content!
Ferrari: He put our car under a Lamborghini car cover.. we want it back.
Ferrari should make an SUV 😂😂😂. For two wheel drive it did well. 😬😬
I’m going to put this on repeat all night man….!!!!!!!  You fucking kill Mae man!!!😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Dude you accidentally made a great case for a Ferrari rally team…🎉
Hey Man we wanna see Rolls Royce in your channel 🎉
Honestly kinda impressed by the bubble
Been waiting to see somebody do that with a Ferrari awsome vid
This video cost roughly 18-24k a minute
Wonder how many Ferrari fan boys are crying themselves asleep after watching this??? I love it!!!
The ending is hilarious 😂
We need another squatted truck taken care of lol
I’m genuinely surprised that it went up those hills and all around in the mud like that no problem. He’s driving his shit like dde would right now lol but not gonna lie when he smacked his gate coming in his driveway i cried internally a slight bit 😂. Keep up the bad ass content, love what you do 🔥👍💯
Lmao your the best!!
I wanted him to wear the whole Ferrari clothing 🤣🤣
That ending was great😂
Bro just plays Forza irl
What more can he do.... Apparently this 👏🏾 Bravo 👏🏾 Haven't let me down yet 🙏🏾
the only thing that could have made that video any better would’ve been a long pause at the end then a random kitchen sink falling from the ceiling! 😂
This is what you tube needs. Amazing.... Brilliant.... A masterpiece
THANK YOU FINALLY someone puts a middle finger in their face
Ferrari watching this: 👁️👄👁️
hey man love your videos. one day i hope i can be as rich as you. not being sarcastic. thanks for the great content.
THANK YOU FINALLY someone puts a middle finger in their face
Pretty amazing this video is getting around 1700 views per minute.. Cody is the king of YouTube.......
"I don't think this is a wise financial decision". - His accountant probably
I was waiting for the helicopter to fall on it!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💪🏼🔥
where does this guy get all this money from? is he a drug dealer?
BRO GOT THE WHOLE MF COLLECTION IN THE BACK
WTF is wrong with this guy.........you know what its, not my money....clearly he didn't have to work for his money because if he did, I dont think he would purposely try to Fuck up his car.... I mean he destroyed the Mercedes....Damn........Just glad it wasn't a GTR....
Bro Cody is actually a very talented driver
Every video better than the last one! This is the type of content everyone wants to see! WD is the next Mr Beast! Mark my words! This kid has more ambition, passion and drive than all his haters combined! Way to fucking go!!!
🎉🎉🎉 Ferrari rally car.🎉🎉🎉
Seriously where did you get that bubble from?
You need to drop the G wagon on the bubbled ferrari.
Finally, a Ferrari durability test.  This guy does what nobody else is willing to do. Crazy, but that's why we love him.
At least say it right
Here me out Cody, you buy me a late 90s Toyota Celica, I let you blow up my Prius.
I told my ol lady whistlin got a Ferrari. She said, " great, he's gonna light it on fire and make it suck his dick." She's a keeper.
This guy cant handle money. He keeps destroying anything nice he can afford. I see no future for this kid after his perents money is gone
A ferrari is probably the only car it'll hurt me deep in side to see destroyed as it is my ultimate dream car.
💀💀💀💯 I love your stuff
I was 😂so hard at the end my stomach was hurting. I think I woke up my entire house.
He drives like I do in gta online
No kitchen sink... terrible video.          ;)
anyone else miss the diesel truck stuff or is it just me
No one going to talk about the military crates in the back? Lol😅
I just love this
I don’t see the point of a lawsuit. Ferrari should be proud that their cars can take this abuse.
Its not Ferary its Ferrari. F. e. r. r. a. r. i .!
How tf is this dude so damn rich lmao
Welp here’s the F*ck around vid, next time we’ll find out if there’s a lawsuit 💀
Try a 14’ Trestle ladder
This is cringe worthy. I don’t understand how people can enjoy this content. What happens when you have too much money to burn.
You didn’t even destroy it
havent even watched but i already know its about to be fire
Filmed on Iphone - lmfao
My Uncles 2wd Ford Ranger could out run that pos! 😂
Did they just made the best ad video for the bubble?
We now know hes not lying about durability testing a BUGATTI when he hits 10million subs
DON'T LET, TERIYAKI 69 SEE THAT
Why does Ferrari not like things like this?? I think its great advertising for Ferrari by showing the capability on their cars, going up those muddy hills with EASE
That car bubble is impressive 😂
Oh now I get it, now I’m mad.
can we talk about how good of a driver cody is
Take for maintenance at the dealership all destroyed
Will the bubble survive monstermax????
I know you're gonna hit it, and it's still surprising and fun. Genius. Lift it so you can fit taller tires so the climbing and fun will be even better.  Saw thousands of movies, nothing this good
Forza in real life🤣
I feel like I just watched a real life forza horizon video
The end was great😭😭
❤ you should put some off road tires
Both of my bosses have Ferraris. I’m sending this to them because they will both shit bricks
This is actually the best video I think I've ever watched
Who else was waiting for a sledgehammer or a swarm of bricks to come into view on the bubble section. Or a trash can maybe even a bowling ball. "Your nuts Jr your nuts" lol #dazedandconfused
LMAO completely awesome!!
Well that was the fastest 14 minutes and 11 seconds of my life.
Lmao the ending was the best. Gimme a hammer.
love the video, cant wait to see you buy a bugatti and do a durability test in the next 3 years
This video makes me so happy congratulations on the Ferrari glad to see how far you’ve come
13:17 POV: ur looking for her lost vape
Bugatti next👍
Make a satirical really boring vlog,
these durability videos are just getting better and better
Honestly I got more upset when he used to destroy Chevy trucks , like destroying a ferrAri is not impressive
You.. *(I’m asian btw)* I COULD HAVE USED THAT MONEY TO BUY RICE!
Man this is one of my favorites. Well done 😂
Just waiting for him to fire an AIM9X at his bubble car😂
Lift kit for the Ferrari
Keep this shit up boy I’m hooked great job
This is Forza Horizon! 🤣🤣
glad i was here before the video had to be taken down lmao
Bro I highly doubt your reading this, but if you are, I fuckin love the new editing. No idea how your selling enough merch and sponsorships to pull this off, but this might be your best video yet. Keep it up 🤘
Ferrari got some sick rally cars nowadays
I didn't realize cody joined wagner group.
This is the best car cover commercial I’ve ever seen
Bro literally made forza irl
The pain 😅
Bruhs channel is all bots😂
Just saying you spent 400k on a car like this and there’s people that can’t even afford a vehicle, let alone a place to live.  Clouts a dangerous thing to be addicted to.
Love it, wanna see it 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I haven't laughed that hard in a long time. You threw so much stuff at it.🤣
I’ve waited for this video omg !
Honestly impressed with the bubble. I need that for my car.
But is the bubble bullet proof? 😂
HALF THE WORLD IS STARVING OR HOMELESS & THIS CLOWN IS BLOWING $400,000 ON A FERRARI THEN TRASHING IT. SOME STUPID SHYT. 💩
Ferrari lawyers about to be paid big time lol
most people cant even drive these cars on dry ass roads and this mf is rallying with it
What happens if you shoot the bubble
whistlin diesel boutta start a whole league of super car hill climbers
I was not prepared for the off-road to be so easy for it. I hate Ferrari but ya gotta hand it to em, that is impressive
The last min of this was fucking epic and more hilarious and funny as it went on
This is something out of a video game brother lol . When you’d take your nice ass car off roading in the video game cause you thought it was cool Af and then here comes whistlin diesel 😂😂. Hell yeah brother! Get some flags to put on it and we’re good lol Raise Hell and Praise Dale!! Yee Yee!!
The last bit of this video had me rolling 😂 I can’t wait to see ( if it’s red it’s dead ) great job on the videos!!
This is not Ferrari.  You are ordered to never cease and desist! Awesome WD!
Tax the Rich 100 is past! WD is the Future!
I hope you have some sort of commission deal made with that bubble company because that was a hell of an advertisement
Here before the lawsuit!
Best content on YouTube
Woods riding with a Ferrari love it
Finally, a quality Italian product👌💯💀💀💯‼️‼️🅿️
You should try to drive it across water 😁 get it up to speed and skip across like a rock 🤣
Reminds me of the good ol days of TaxTheRich vids!
The spy balloon comment was the icing on the cake
this was painful to watch
Bet you won't destroy a Pagani 😆 😂
Wo I just finished the video the only damage he did to the Ferrari was the front when heated  the gate but I’m just happy there was no more damage.
Mans is playing forza in real life 🤣
can I have the passenger seat for a chair
Ferrari is writing the cease and desists as we speak LOL. You will be the talk of the office at Ferrari HQ tomorrow
Bro is playing for a horizon 6
I am so fucking excited!!!!!
That’s what I’m talking about! Destroy that piece of metal
Would love to see a collaboration with Westin Champlin
Cody is the new taxtherich100
Your videos get better and better every time keep it up
You’re not posting fast enough for me lol
Absolutely quality material.  The best youtuber ever!
This thing needs a "Squat-Job".
that bubble was incredibly durable!
Your insane bro hahahaha
The only upsetting part of this video is that it ended
Ferrari sent me a cease and desist for liking this video, also kinda disappointed you didn't avalanche those cases on le bubblę
That 4 door Toyota was the best part of the video
Everything but the kitchen sink?
What on earth are you doing? Why constantly break things? People are out there with nothing and your here acting like this? I hope Ferrari sue you and you lose all of what you have left and the dwindling 50k you probably have. I’m reporting this to Ferrari myself. Unbelievable
You forgot to throw the kitchen sink.
Be sure to do a chicago sunroof on that bad boah, so jealous that i cant
This is what living in indiana does to a person. Cody the Greatest Content Creator Ever! 😂
I literally love these videos 😭😭😭 idk why middle aged white men hate him so much  It’s his money and the content is enjoyable to watch
It’s sad that a $400,000 car is so cheaply made.
Dawg this is my favorite video by far love the content/u trnna let me get the engine 4 my pos after it’s destroyed??🫡
Cody drives that car around like a GTA character.
Needs to be a commercial for the bubble lol
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 amazing Bro 👑
This gonna blow up lmao
This is quality entertainment thanks codi 👌😎😎
This Ferrari will end up on a season of car trek, cheep super car episodes
THIS 😂
Cody is the anti-mr-beast
i will pay a few bucks for shredded ferrari or is it shrederarri
I think Ferrari could care less what you do with the car want to purchase it
6:57 rip hilux :(
Hey whistling diesel!!!!. How’s it going brother, i seen another video on tiktok of someone thinking he found your dads skidsteer and it lines up pretty good dude. It wasn’t the first video where you commented on but a New one! I honestly think that it’s your dads brother!
I like this dude, he's endearing.
That’s my favorite car I love this video just makes me want one even more
Cody you can’t do that with a Ferrari they will sue you
O YouTube E.U.A realmente paga muito bem 🤣🤣
Just insane and love it❣️❣️
I love how Cody treats his cars.
So when are you going to fly me out to drive it?
Used to be funny. Now it is just wasteful
There must have been 20 people standing off camera throwing objects at that car. Outstanding.   Hope to see a part II soon. Thanks for making content. It is amazing.
You really wanna get sued🤣🤣🤣love it
LEGENDARY 5 STARS WANTED BY FERRARI
This one kinda hurt considering how many are built but good looking car nice to have someone thrash it like a old car tho lol
So this is what dad thinks I'm gonna do with the Ferrari when I take it out.
After your done with reviewing, and testing the build quality of the Ferrari can i have it PRITTY PLEASE
When does the destroying part happen ? You must be cornfused Cody.
Best to date! Priceless.
Kid is living every blue collar man’s dream
🤣🤣🤣 this is gold
Ferrari punching air right now
love this video
If that bubble company doesn’t pay you out for the insane amount of business you’re about to send their way, sue them like Ferrari is preparing to sue you.
amazing vid
This is some funny stuff, looking forward to the next vid!
bro playing forza irl
Congrats on the Ferrari. This video is absolute perfection in every way, you guys kill it
It's Official..... You've completely lost your f*ucking mind!!!!!!! And I LOVE it!   You're crazy as shit but holy f*ck is it entertaining!   They're is NOT 1 single other place on the planet to watch a once in a lifetime Beat Down like that.
holy cow a ferrari in the wild
Honestly, im waiting on a tesla durability test 🤣
Well he can DRIVE
before you wreck it you should actually get a lift kit with chunky tires and rally it for real.
Yes yes yes
Get this jackhole out of my feed.    I’ve dreaded this day.
honestly if the ferrari holds up well, not sending cody a cease and desist might be the best marketing move by ferrari in the past 5 years lol
Feels like need for speed
Can we pls get a 2 angle of everybody throwing the stuff at it 😂
This is like if Family Guy was real
Ferrari shouldn't sue. If anything it just shows how durable those pos's can be. If anything he needs to send Ferrari an invoice.
hope he got ppf so it didnt get rock chips...
That’s my dream car. Everyday I imagine that car in my driveway 😢
nicest soobie rally car by far.
Tax the rich is back!😂
Fucking love it bro keep grinding 💪
14 minutes feel too short
You should drive it through a corn field.
Enzo would turn in his grave if he saw this video 😂
*Ferrari salesman*: “no fr pls not this car I’ll lose my job”  *Whistlin Diesel*: “no fr im taking care of it
Video should be titled Forza in real life
The car bubble thing...yup best laugh I had all week.
Yoooo, now can you sell it to me for $1?
Hell ya boss
Fast and feeious 2.0
Bruh he’s actually gonna do it 🤣🤣🤣🤣

Shot in the dark, but would you be willing to gear out in some UFPro gear and go Airsoft to Op Lion Claw?
I have never been this satisfied.
WOW EVERYTHING I WANT TO DO TO A CAR ALL IN ONE VIDEO LMFAO 🤣

the alexa cue on "oh its a" is hilarious

Lmfao at throwing the MSCHF AirCast 1s at the car
Been fucking waiting for this one man I’m excited
guys please dont fall for the scam comments, they will steal your information if your go to the giveaways
actually a pretty good driver
That’s the best damn product marketing ad ever for that car bubble
Getting a lawsuit in the mail really means, go reorganize aka file chapter 11
I legit almost passed myself laughing out loud after he said throw me a hammer and following shenanigans.
Love the vids bro
Tha fact that it  made it through the first video 👍
Real live forza 6
This had me dying I’m glad someone’s doing this kind of stuff I love this shit
you just made the best commercial for that bubble cover.
Hands down the best YouTuber right here. Or does he run the entire simulation?
Well where is the kitchen sink? U threw everything at it but the kitchen sink bro..
Hell yeah dude
Doing better than any squatted truck up those hills 😂
This is amazing
Bro is literally playing Forza in real life
Every time I watch these videos I think “why disrespect these beautiful machines!” But then I think “but it would be fun…”
this mf just playing forza in real life😂
funniest shit ever 😂😂
Reaper wheels
🥲
i been waiting on this moment for a long time still wating on ferrari bottles to come out ill pay 500 for the key to the car
A cupcake tin. Nice.
My resting heart rate is 45, I checked during this video it was 110. Second hand Adrenaline
It’s like he’s in Forza Horizon in real life. These just keep getting better!!
A bunch of people in the comments on Instagram were crying about stolen valor meanwhile Cody has a thicc fil a sticker on it 😭😭😭
I am sad the last thing you threw at it wasn't a kitchen sink 🤣
Soooo was this just a advertisement for the car bubble? I kinda want one now
Ending felt like a Family Guy skit with how it kept going
Oh boy !!!
This whole video was impressive
I love the car and I have no problem watching it die! Congrats on the first Rarri Cody!
40 seconds in and its all ready totaled. Great job.
This Is funny asfff😂
This guy I just need my mobile home payed off for my fam🤣😩
Hands down he is the best on YouTube
I don’t know what I’m more impressed with, the cars off road capabilities or the inflatable bay durability
Thumbs up as soon as I opened the video
I'd be worried more if you wrecked a Datsun than that bucket
monster max the ferrari
Ferrari is probably going to be butthurt over this, however this was therapeutic to watch. Can I take a spin in it? Figured I'd ask 😂
Dude is awsom3
Dudes playing forza horizon in reel life
I love it dude. …
can I barrow 10,000. I need to put a roof on my mothers house
Hi Cody haven’t watched the whole video yet to see if the car is still usable, but can I trade you a PB&J for the car
I bet Ferrari executives couldn’t wait for this video launch 🤣
I was entertained.... Good Job
No kitchen sink. Not a true test
Buying that bag incase of riots
im a little sad for this cars fate then i remember its ferrari fuck them XD
Best purchase so far? Maybe, let’s see if it can withstand Cody’s abuse
First the shoes, now this. This man is a menace.
🫣😭😭😭😭 more then you can afford pal
Put the Ferrari engine in a Polaris razor!
What a total duchebag… Anything for clicks? Right dickhead?
This is what too much money looks like ladies and gentlemen
Whistlindiesel has the best content in youtube love your videos bro 🎉
I mean he showed the durability of it. I’m impressed. Now jump it
Killiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit
@ferrari look at this! it's a business opportunity!
As much as I hate what you do, I love how you do it 😂
Where does he get the money to do all this?
it’s a good day when he posts
Drive a golf ball at the bubble.
Probably couldn’t afford the Bugatti test so he got the Ferrari
Jesus fucking christ, I was eating when they started throwing stuff at it and I actually choked on my food. That was amazing
😂😂😂😂😂I love this guy
bro is in gta server
Ok. Clean that shit up now.
If it's red it's dead
This guy is a bitch and cringe and because he has money people think its " cool " lol
Brilliant
The GTR hurt to watch but for some reason this made me happy
I hope you read my comment cus I wanna tell you that you’re the best YouTuber!
I bet you won’t sell me that car for $20 and let me destroy it
He’s definitely getting banned for making anymore Ferrari brand new purchases
the best part is clean up the shop 😂😂😂
Forza in real world.
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahha god bless this video
I feel like I've been Rick Rolled
I think I'm over this semi-literate retard.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Fs in the chat for people who don’t know what grinder sparks do to paint. Thank you for grinder awareness.

The end was absolutely wild 😂
I’d love to see this guy tear apart a Rolls Royce or Bentley interior
LETS GOOOOO
Up there with the prettiest modern cars I’ve seen. Shrek it up
This guys straight up playing Forza in real life😂😂
So right now I’m starting to watch the video I just hope he dose not destroy the Ferrari.
Yo how tf did they throw that tire like it was nuffin
Noo why waste food like this, i would have eaten that horse :(
😂
I love this man so much
I appreciate you
Can a brother just get a bad azz Baja bug?
Nice cover it’s better then the car 😄😂😂😄😄😂😂😄
The only thing missing is guns n ammunition..
One of the best endings I've ever seen.
This was amazing and just saying if your looking for a buggati to destroy still @stradman is selling the cheapest one in the US..
How tf did that bubble stop all of that 😂😂😂
Your money you can waste it if you want lol
All I’m sayin is if you wanna off road jus call Ferrari………..
I’ve been waiting for this so long
Significantly better off-road than I would’ve guessed. I’ve had 4wd trucks that couldn’t do some of that shit lmao
It’s like a modern taxtherich video taken to 11
Buggy wheels PLEASE
2:13 - I did not know Koenis...g (however they spell it) did that!! LOL 4:41 - that look ..lol
YOU WOULD, TOO! 🤣🤣🤣
Finally a Ferrari with a real driver and test
Wow.  It actually made it through day 1. 😅
I will take anything thats left on that kar :( haha
One of the best YouTubers out here. Insane video as per usual. Fkn love this shit
carbon
If this doesn't get you 10M subs I don't know what will.
savor this quality content while we still can before Ferarri makes WD take it down
Stradman disliked this video 👎🏽
Wasn’t really a flex. Shoulda been a brand new unwrapping it and straight into this. Was broke in first so it don’t count. Try harder next time Cody we expect Quality. Idiot.
So bugged!
Now this is Daily Driven Exotics
Best Ferrari durability test video out there!
I might get sued for commenting
Ferrari needs to sponsor you! I would buy one after watching this video
You are crazy bro xd 😂
Am not doing enough in life. HAHAHA Motivation!
Bro is playing forza horizon in real life.
Do t need to destroy it it'll destroy it's self
More like a Fer-rally at this point.
He just lives in Forza horizon
Bro threw a freaking traxxas slash ford raptor at it 😂😂😂
Is it just me that wants to order the car balloons 😂
Me when I play Forza
Awesomeness 😆🤩💯💯💯💯
so much fun!
YOU’RE STUPID IF YOU THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO GET YELLOW!
legendary
It hurts to watch
Love you brother 💓
And that’s why you are my favorite person in the whole world 🌎 ❤
Ferrari in a Lambo covers i fuckin love this guy lmao
Underrated
Yea but daddy's too cheap to allow him to do this in a rolls royce, that's why we're tearing up budget sports cars.
the guy with the book got me lol
Say I won't !
Yk he's blacklisted after this one😂😂
Absolutely epic! Been waiting on this video for awhile!! Taking Ferrari ownership to the next level, keep it up!
Did this in forza and yes its totally possible very durable reliable vehicle
Before you know it kody will be the hyper cars new durability standards
Was the last thing thrown, a corn dog 🤔
He spit on that horse c*ck with experience and authority. I like it.
3:46 most funnyest thing ive ever seen. keep up the good work, that made my day.
RED=DEAD!!!
13:58 tell me you sent someone to home depot for 15 kitchen sinks... COME ON
Bro 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ferrari would like to know your location
I never laughed so damn hard🤣 What tf you threw half the shop at the car!
Keep doing gods work man!  Love it. You never disappoint. I laughed way harder than I’d like to admit.
If I remember correctly  "If its red, its dead"
When everything was flying at the cat I was waiting for the kitchen sink lol
This is hilarious but I know it hurts deep inside to do this to these cars Lmao it’s still awesome content
This man literally lives in Forza horizon
let me just say i am truly shocked u didnt actually destroy it
Tossed a muffin pan at it 😂😂😂
3:18 😂😂😂😂😂
This is the dumbest channel on YouTube
Absolutely love watching you break the internet. “Throw me a hammer” and all the stuff flying was legit LOL.
You know those creepy videos of people hearing screaming in the woods? Well it’s probably just a Ferrari. 😂😂
Love to see it
This is literally Forza IRL…
I know this is weird, but can you buy me my first car?😅
What a douche!!!!
Beamng irl
Wow! Exploring new territory here. Love it
This guy breaks stuff so we don’t have to
I’ve been waiting months (for a new video) only to watch you destroy a car that costs more than my house!!! Yes… Yes I have, and it’s going to be glorious.
Acutally the first word that comes to my mind when you say Ferrari is... Ferrari.
"if it's red it's dead"
8:06 this made me remembered when he was doing this but with cheap pickup truck now its a 400k ferrari and I love it
We need this
He drives like I do in forza😂
😅😅😅
I fucking love this dude lmfao
YO THATS A MARINE HAIRCUT, STOLEN VALOR!!!!
I needed this 💆
“It’s just stuff” should be on a T-shirt you sell.
ferrari = Ford F250
Get this man a Performante
Not even halfway through and it’s freaking hilarious 😂
Excellent video 😆 simps gonna be butthurt internet wide.
You crazy MF!!! We love you!!!!!
About time a new video bro.. been checking this YouTube every day waiting for a new one
He is never going to have to buy fuel for Monster Max again, ever. He's going to have to use that excavator to dig a lake to hold all the hater tears.
Should definitely rally build it. Thing would be sick as a rally time attack even though it’s RWD
Status level achieved.   LEGEND!!
The amount of objects at the end I'm literally crying bro LMAOOO 💀💀😭🤣
What a shame. A child in Africa could have used this car to bring water to his mother dying of AIDS
Amazing video
yall shoulda threw a crt tv at it
Glad you destroyed a Ferrari But you better watch out they might just send you a cease and desist....... The only car company in the world that gets upset when you buy their vehicle and do what you want with it can't even change the paint job or rims without the company getting butt hurt
@8:30 I fucking love this shit 😎🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼
Real life Forza😂😂😂
lmfao at the end u accidentally filmed a great commercial for the product
Forza Horizon 6 looks 🔥🔥🔥
The ending got me dying 🤣🤣🤣💀
WD living all our dreams
Wow lol
rally ferrari, I like it
Nice car. I'll give you $7 for it.
Referral link to the bubble thing? That was impressive!  So far showing that the car is made well.
bahahaha awesome!
That bubble is seriously amazing. Nice ode to deadmau5
Cody's driving skills are highly underrate
Fuck Ferrari in the ass! 😂
Royalty exotics is going to be so pissed when you bring back that rental car
I like the Lambo and r8 better good thing the Ferrari is red best color to destroy!!
You should hire a professional car stuntman
His first and last ferrari lol ill buy it and restore it
Whats next a plane
love you
IDK. Feel like this is perfect marketing for Ferrari.
cant wait for more 😂
Can I just have the car after it's done being destroyed idc if it's in pieces I just want to say I own a Ferrari 😂
I never thought I would truly say this but, the ending scene is the best. 😂😂😂
the new @taxtherich100
I love that white alfo romeo spider in the backround
Living everyone's dream of just using expensive cars and clothing and just working it till failure.. love it boys
Cody's out here playing forza in real life😄😄
Giving the people what they want
Love this guy 😂🔥
I feel like the company that he bought that car protector from needs a major shoutout lol. It withstood everything whistling diesel threw at it lol  Literally
😢😢😢😢😢
10:08 pretty skilled
Your crazy haha i love it

Ferrari's legal team is personally coming to seize this vehicle
This is the WD we all know and love. ❤
What on earth are you doing? Why constantly break things? People are out there with nothing and your here acting like this? I hope Ferrari sue you and you lose all of what you have left and the dwindling 50k you probably have. I’m reporting this to Ferrari myself. Unbelievable
This is like playing forza
Literally gta
Me in forza horizon 5
Bet you won’t get a viper ACR 🫣
Sickkkkk
Amazing job! Original entertaining content that no one replicates. Thank you for this next level entertainment!!
Literally forza horizon in real life lol🤣

That car bubble scene was comedy, good advertising right there!
Actually shocked the bubble held up
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Where is the Bugatti?
Bros playing forza
6:57 is it bad I was more worried about him damaging the Hilux here lol
This video is basically a hidden ad for Ferrari and the bubble company.
13:33 Chicago at 3 AM
Hi
We love whistlendiesel so muchhhh
We need a ferrari on buggy wheels please
Ferrari's lawyers just knocked on my door just for watching you destroy the Ferrari
i wish i had enough money to do this
Give it to me
Thats crazy hearing the name Keller in videos, I've never met someone else in person with the same first name!
hahahahahahahahahaha!!!
I feel like there is a part 2 on the way
no one every forza player ever
13:20  that would make a nice ringtone
Please convert it into a boat
Good loook
I respect the hell out of this guy 😂
Red its dead!
Lmao Ferrari will shit themselves
I LOVE THIS GUY, I wonder if we could ever get some behind the scenes on a video like this to see if beating up a Ferrari really hurts this man or if it doesn't phase him!? WHAT A G...TOP G!
Shoot it with a paint ball gun
Wheres the "TAKE THAT OFF YOU DIDNT EARN IT" guy from Instagram
Always the best content on this channel. WhistinDiesel never disappoints 👍🏻
Better Call Saul!
This should just be an ad for that car bubble
my mans paying forza irl souls sick tho
Now we all know how the Ferrari f8 does off-roading in forza and gta5 lol 😂😂😂
I laughed so much when watching this 😂😂
Bet you wouldn’t have the balls fart on it
Ending was the best lol
I think this is my favorite video of all the ones you guys have done
You forgot the kitchen sink lol 🤣
Nice car
Noice
Ferrari...pffft. When I was 8 I went to Circus Circus. The place is a fever dream. I was offered to sit in the Ferrari or the Diablo. I chose the Diablo because it was my favorite car. He asked if I wanted to check out the Ferrari. I told the guy no and asked if I could sit in the Diablo longer😄 I knew zero about the history of the 2 car maker's at the time.
I like the content but this is too far dude ….  I don’t wish for you to get sue by Ferrari ,absolutely not but there’s better ways to make content..  I much prefer Asher buy your merch and see if I can win the car ..
I NEED to get a car bubble for my cars. ROFLMAO OMGWTFBBQ 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love that car!
tough bag!
The end😂😂
The gunshot noises sent me😂🤣
Good job. Your parents are proud of you. 🤗
14:09 which one 🤣🤣🤣
Purrari😂
Ferrari  needs to make a rally  car & team whistlin. Car did really  well offroad!....keep it up

Exhaust note is ear sex
Its like forza horizon but in real life
Ferrari is going to sue you now

Okay how many people did that ending take
The editing is top notch 😂😂
This guy NEEDS to try snowmobiling
8:00 Forza Horizon IRL
Gta in real life or even forza just turned into real hard work and real money spent on expensive car and drove through a field.
champagne bottles popping off at Ferrari and the bubble maker 🤑
This was painful to watch
Lol that bubble is serious
This was a great video
Y’all threw everything but the kitchen sink🤣
lmfao that shirt for women 🤣🤣🤣
What’s all those green cases?
Was waiting on one of those Nike shoes to come flying
I've never been a fan of Ferraris, however, the F8 is gorgeous! That being said run it over with your tank
Hmmmmm I’ll be back soon for that pt2
Madness hahaha
Plot twist he calls state farm after each video makes mo 💰

What’s the towing capacity?
Idk why but this one hurt me a little
Not enough destruction for the first video. All that can be buffed 🥱
Hahaha that's bomb!!!!!🔥🔥🔥
Putting mud to air intake was clickbait
🤣💯🔥... seriously!! Where was the kitchen sink at? That would be the money shot making thru the bubble.
Cody in the army outfit reversing 180'ing is exactly like a 12 year old in GTA5 😂😂
This how we all drive the new cars when the forza dlc drops
Enzo ferrari just died again in his grave!
👌😂👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
The Doug shit got me  💀
Looking at this car thinking how badass I would be driving this to work and snapping this hoe
Red is dead.
Faz um piz de 100.000  doletas pra mim kkk

The car bubble company is going to be sold out for awhile
Always a pleasure sir

Best looking Ferrari I have seen yet till you cleaned it

Forza irl
And DDE says they abuse their cars
This man is insane.  Tear it up then just money
nice video!
Best video period..
Bro you’re a legend
Forza horizon five be like
Your videos are all the same for someone who does it for a living you can do way better than just break and dent and scratch things for content it’s not even cool anymore just being honest it was in like 2020 or something but not 2023 just do real content or normal stuff this is old man no way you look at these videos and say yes that’s good here
WhistlinDiesel always come through with the content keep doin what ya doin man 🤣
Yeah he's getting sued.
Car Bubble stocks just went thru the roof
I think this is the best video ever made
Am I the only guy wondering why he has so many military boxes
That was awesome did anything actually pop it
No way 😂
Dudes out here playing Forza 6 early release
you should sell that clip to the bubble company as a commercial of how well it holds
This look like me in forza
What the fuck, literally everything but the kitchen sink!!! That’s great.
Hilarious
Best ending ever
bye ferarri 🤣
I can’t believe I’m watching this😂
This is the greatest video on the internet
Your going to court again
Put a wide body kit on it and change the wheels put some big tires on it to piss off Ferrari 🤣🤣
Don't ever change brother 🤣
Congrats Cody! Love your videos, you've truly mastered the way of capturing people's attention! If its either positive or negative, you're the one getting paid, keep it up bro!!
This is just next level. Thanks for having the guts to take on Lawsuit happy manufacturer’s. Awesome! 👏
Your creativity is what keeps us all hooked. Your personality keeps us entertained.
Can you post a video when Ferrari gets butthurt and sends the cease and desist order?
I love how streetspeed butes in whistlin, and then whistlin just turns it up a notch and shows the difference between the big leagues and the minors.  Well done!
This kid has issues
Do donuts in the mud until you reach the max wheel speed😂😂
thats it tecniclyy YOU DIDINT DESTROY IT its RED make a apolagy video 😂
You Materialistic Bastard….. 🤣
Doug would like to give it a score.
The ending 😂😂
the disrespect for ferrari
Kids paying roblox be like:
At 7:51 I could almost smell the clutch from here 🤘🤘🤘
What’s up with all the crates 🤣🤣
I'm not ASMR guy but tools being chucked at a Ferrari in a car condom was better than any damn wind chimes I've ever heard
Wow worth the wait
Goated
The ultimate destroyer is back, destroy all
I came here to see if the Ferrari lawyers left a comment…
Daddy's money has never looked so good. Can't wait to see the legal fees and trauma from WhistlingD owning this beautiful piece of art.     Destroy the f*ck out of this shiny red turd!!!
If Forza Horizon was real
They really threw the entire toolbox at the end😭
this could be a hour long and I wouldn't miss a second
This dude playing forza horizon irl
you used to do all your stunts man what happened to you diesel?
Awesomeness fuck FERRARI!!!!!!¡!
Gotta love him!!
Nice to see you making up for all the garage queens out there👌👌 Please never stop destroying expensive stuff!
So much fun seeing someone do idiotic stuff in their Ferrari:)
A Magnum PI skit must be had.
Ferrari vs monster max
You just made the best advertisement for the car balloon that could ever possibly exist
Don't take a 2005 Ford 6.0 powerstroke and run it over with  mastermax so please do it
Lmaooo you a mook bro
I was waiting for the kitchen sink
Who makes that inflatable car tent??
YES! 🙌🏼🤣
Needs an 8” lift
I’ll give u 5 bucks and a chicken sandwich for it (I need a car)🥲
Dude checked the drain hole
Best video yet😂
This is why I love whistlindiesel
Why was this a Ferrari W wtf
This video felt like it ended way too early. Loved it!
Just keep rewinding and he keep clapping
i know the Ferrari executives sweating right now, saying something like  WHO TF SOLD HIM A FERRARI?!?
You should jump off a ladder on to that inflatable cover for your Ferrari
Ain’t no way bro💀…  This shit is awesome!
He’s playing Forza irl lol
Buy me a Ferrari?
Oh this guy cracks me up the best part was the bubble wasn't expecting everything in the shop hitting it😄appreciate ur videos
Request:  I would like to see that thing in a headon with a squatted truck please.
i have been trying to get chatgpt to predict what your next video will be but its always wrong some day
Keep up the amazing content Cody! I love it how it handle going up the hill. Bad asss
If I was Ferrari I would just adapt and hire Whislin to make an off road Ferrari!Stop being so buttoned up lol
It's a shame that video didn't end with a fire extinguisher, Super Troopers style.
Probably a publicity stunt and a promo for Ferrari..any good publicity is good publicity folks.
The f8 is one of their shittiest cars bro i bet you bought it for yourself then hated it so now youre gonna destroy it to get your investment back
You should destroy a classic muscle car next 😁
I’ll give you 16k for it
that car bubble thing is actually really impressive LMFAO
start neutral dropping your cars
So awesome this is litterly the kinda stuff I'd wish I could see when I was a kid
You're a psycho and every single one of us love it 😂 how's that for Cody's broke secret fan boys?
Now I'm sitting here wondering...just saw news article about Deadmau5s Ferrari today..how did he get this video out that fast...
Playing forza in real life
Anything for content…..smh
cody is living the forza life
Material possesions are trash and we are being lied to , money isnt everything and life is much more than people think
Has more faith in that plastic bag than most men have in God
missed opportunity at the end to throw a kitchen sink
Lol "hand me a hammer"
get dynamite and blow it up😂😂
Put a small lift kit on the Ferrari
oh man i love you for makeing this videos
this mf playing forza irl
Was kinda hoping itd actually get destroyed tho
I love the lambo car cover on the Ferrari at the start
Jump it. Don't think just do it
I deserve this car! My zipper broke DAY #2 on my MONSTER max one of a kind #1140 out of 3500 Hoody! I've been a fan from DAY one! and MY guts just Came out my rear end after watching this! BROOO!!!
She sounded fantastic BUT, it was hard to watch.
😂😂😂😂😂
This man is wild, and that's coming from someone who smokes crack 🤣
He didn't even hurt it. Clickbait!
Adult owned, garage kept, never abused or driven in rain.
hi cody
you should've buy a tesla and do a hard test on it!!!
This Gives Taxtherich Vibes 👍🏾
Trigged🤣🤣🤣
Thank God he bought a Ferrari
Literally threw everything at it but the kitchen sink 😂
Get a c8 and see how strong it is then
Ferrari should be thanking him for testing the of road handling Capabilities
I loved every min i will rest peacefully now
@DailyDrivenExotics Where are you at?
No one notice the Lamborghini cover on the car😂😂😂😂
This hurts to watch😭
The new Ferrari side by side is pretty dope! Alittle low to the ground but it seemed to handle it fine!
About time someone finally did something about Ferrari, so wild to me that even after owning it they want to control what you can and cant do with it.
Gotta love how he put a Lamborghini cover on it 😂
Awesome
Honestly I hate you cody, not for what your doing to these vehicles, no no no its pure jealousy, everybody preaches true freedom but to be the true embodiment of it is something I've only seen you achieve, I hope to one day feel that blissful
Neeeeeed moreeee
Cody you the best 😈😈😈😂
That was pretty entertaining especially the end, good video Cody
Was that a Roxor in the back in the beginning?
the last thing he threw i was waiting for it lol
Time to put paddle tires on this bad boy and see how it rips in the sand.
My guy is about to get Justin Bieber’d.
Super funny edits.
At this point Cody is playing Forza Horizon but in real life after watching him drive up the mountainside and drift the gravel driveway
Watching him drive around in the Ferrari off-road look like real life Forza horizon haha
Actual footage of me playing forza
This is the most lit video since when Kodak got outta jail and threw away 250,000$ to prove he getting money
You get to do what we all dream of doing. Oh and I shouldn’t have laughed that hard when you drew that on the horse 😂🤦🏻‍♂️
The jump cut after the broom falling on the car took me the fuck out 😂😂😂😂
Forza horizon 6 looks dope
Your going to be the next tax the rich! Love your content
Congrats on your last Ferrari! This is awesome!
Lol the bubble is dope. I need one for my precious red squatted truck 😍
Hilarious you should have been dressed up as magnum PI
People underestimate even thier regular lowered cars 😅 they can off-road pretty damn well
My guy 😂😂😂 🤘🏻🫡
Well I've been thinking for years on how I could write off a Ferrari on farm tax.  After seeing how well it does on dirt!   I'm all for it 🤣
Forza horizon in real life
such a beautiful car
Y’all should have went in the bubble
You bought something cool anyone can by shit let’s see you and your two hands build something big dog  dude you’re the fuck face rich kid
ROFL.  The penis on the horse. 😂
god i swear Cody need to hire someone just to detail his cars like twice a week
Unveiling the Ferrari with the Lamborghini Huracan cover followed by hocking a big loogi on the emblem straight outta the gate is so damn great! 🤣
Bro playing forza irl
you should paint it anime
Bro playing forza horizon 5 irl
Just imagine if a car company would hire Cody to stress test their vehicles and the advertising that their vehicles were WD approved! Everyone would buy from that company!
bros playing forza irl
been waiting for this one!
Someone’s gotta do it. Thanks Cody
I wonder if his friends make any money 🤣
Let’s talk about how big it drive is
I’m serious when I say this,  you’re my favorite person on YouTube. These videos are insanely entertaining and not to mention genuinely hilarious!  You guys really know how to make good content. 🥂
Watching that thing drift on his driveway has unlocked a new life goal for me
I'd actually do the same exact stuff if I own a Ferrari so nobody be mad
Loved it but gotta ask. What’s in all the totes?
Please fill that bag with helium and let it go. I want to see if Brandon shoots it down or not
Some people: might be able to afford a Ferrari...one day... WD: buys one, and draws a d!ck on the horse 🐴 ...😅
Ferrari cease and desist incoming for having fun in your own car
This guy is literally driving a supercar that cost a fortune and is literally taking it's virginity and it's cherry popped red to my wife you better not be watching this!!!!!
Dude lives like he’s in Forza Horizon. 😂
In before you get sued
Hysterical. I laughed the entire video.
This man needs to test all cars 😂

This is what I’m talking about savage!!!
i feel to poor to watch this video
i dont think that was just a hammer
Can't wait to see Ferrari copyright claiming this video!!!
Whats a Ferrari?
Smart people create things not destroy it. You clearly have more money than IQ. You only impress some 13 yo TikTok kids. Who the fuck are you?
is it bad i was more impressed by the bubble than the car? haha
I'm only halfway thru the video and I had to pause ⏸ and tell you all that.... I gotta lie I'm  impressed 🤏 Just kidding I lied 🤪........ this is awesome........ Ferrari is gonna loose thier mind for you using a Lamborghini car cover on that thing 🎯😵
The only guy who bought a Ferrari and is actually enjoying it  and driving like it was meant to be driven. HARD
Dude has so many unintentional product endorsements and is the 20 yr old Jeremy Clarkson
Put the wagon wheels on it Cody
O my god bruh🫣🫣🫣🫣🫣
I just called and woke up my girlfriend to tell her about the new video..
passed round 1 doubt it will make it past round 3
what will history think if they find this 1000 years in the future after nuclear holocaust
This was a really good ad for that car bubble.
Dude 14 min long come the fuck on the ending had me crying 😂😂
Imagine being a neighbor to this guy and hearing a Ferrari screaming around the hills.
You are playing with our dreams 😴
Bro Turned into Plainrock124
bros playing gta irl
I love it, but I do have the thought in the back of my mind that Ferrari is gonna Pasta La Vista WhistlinDiesel
😍😍
You are a fucken nut lol love it
Says enable notifications video about to drop. Then clickbait’s us to wait 24 hours later. First time clickbaiting 👍👍👍👍
I'm so glad someone finally stuck it to ferrari, and I'm glad it was wistlin diesel. hope you don't get a cease and desist!
I love this guy
I wonder if this video  is to show up street speed 717 ???
Amazing ending

The part with the inflatable cover had me HOWLING 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Is that a bunch of military equipment/ barrack boxes in the background ? 🤔

They should just sponsor your this  would be a great add
Imaging being Cody's tax guy  "You are trying to deduct what? You did what with it? Ah hell no"
Hey bro, you’re a good dude and you make great content. You are the MAN!
Laughing so hard I'm actually crying
When you play Forza horizon in real life
What I’d give for just 5 grand 😂 love the videos man!
I want to see one race on a dirt track oval
But we all know what red means to cody!!!
Pure entertainment Ferrari should hire you
Hey Cody love the videos and content i have a question and  know you probably will not read this but what happened to the video of I bought a skid loader And took it mudding it was one of my favorite videos  and want to watch it a lot and love the content and love the beating up of the ferrari
Make it a rally car !!!!!
Reminds me of the old tax the rich videos
Honestly that thing rips better than I figured on gravel and dirt.
I bet the military is rethinking their contracts on vehicles.
The ending of everything he was throwing at the car in the bubble reminded me of the ending of fireworks on July 4th
12:45 ain’t no way bro air balled a fuckin ladder 💀
god this hurt to watch but it also didn't bother me as much bc it's u. well done man put the car to "good use"
He did not lie it is actually the best video he has ever made I love it keep it up man
Whistlin diesel is 100% my legend and best YouTuber OUT THERE!!
Sounds insane bouncing off limiter
best video in a minute 😭😭😭
If this turned into a supercar, off-road channel... I wouldn't be mad.
Why’d he change photo title
Every time It seems like Cody can't get any wilder he proves me wrong😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣
What's in all them serious looking Pelican cases?
My uncle's got a bubble like that for his F100 show truck! Badass cover!
Ferrari is coming for him after this 🤣
Best Ferrari commercial ever they should pay this man 😂 plus whistling diesel can drive his ass off lol
Bro you need to swap that motor  out an slap 👋 a Cummins diesel
Would what have been funny is whine they started throwing stuff at the thing that’s protecting the car they throw a dildo😭😭😭
Dude lives in forza horizon but in real life😅
The cat made me laugh the hardest, then you said, "Give me a hammer." 🤣🤣🤣
You should make a video where one of your buddies is trying to make you nervous my pretending to scratch one of your cars so you swing a golf club or bat to try and hit him but hit the car and the entire video is about you destroying it by trying to protect it! 😂
I think the bubble wrap is stronger than Ferrari itself
Ferrari is gonna be mad XDDDDD
I hope you stretch this out for many videos.!! LMAO
It hurts to see expensive cars get destroyed lol but but if you get butthurt over it you are a p
Episode 5 of whistlin trying to get sued 🤣
Best video ever!
They threw everything at that bubble except the kitchen sink
My boss has the same Ferrari maybe put 4000 miles on it. thxs for actually putting it through its paces. I can't wait to show him this in the am
nice car . you would like my Red 1967 FIREBIRD
The things thrown at the car was like from a cartoon
Remember: “If it’s red, it’s dead.”
HowToBasic but for cars
The bubble was the most impressive part lol. Who ever made that deserves a shoutout. That was a legit review for them
TOO BAD YOU CANT catch the scammers that try to get your subscribers to bite their bull shit (  Thanks for watching our YouTube channel you've been selected for today's giveaway 🎁 send a message to the above name 👆👆to claim prize )  I bet it would be EPIC!  Ide PAY to watch!  I responded to your I bought a $400,000 Ferrari just to destroy it video and instantly got that reply.  Thats why we cant have nice stuff!
i liked the muffin pan at the end
😂😂😂
try shooting an arrow at it through the bubble
that was good
Sick
Ferrari 👍🏼
I was genuinely significant more upset about the nice trucks and Farmall.
First thing that comes to mind. Is "3 minutes longer" #Ferrari
i don’t know about you i really enjoyed this one
In otherwords " I was never taught to respect anything nice "
This is so sick!  Can't believe we've gone from 12v Cummins to Ferraris. I hope this  car gets at least a 12 part series of test and tortures. Deff needs to be lifted with big mud tires
Cody's just playing a real-life version of Forza Horizon.
They will gonna sue you
Keep it going!!! I wish I Can drive it  😩 ❤
imagine being this ghay
Should get another sema truck for a "durability test"
Bro do some offroading with offroader SUVs
I can't even buy a car period and this guy is finna disrespect this car with the most eye opening attention and Ferrari will be highly pissed because he gonna treat it like he went to a car auction and spent 500$
This is Forza IRL
😂 😂 😂 😂
Video is badass keep up the great content only way to break in a $400K car😂😂
If you not broke send me that ferarri
I can’t watch this😂😂😂 it hurts

Ferrari, please make a rally car for whistlinDiesel. thanks in advance.
Ferrari flamability test up next i hope😂
Kinda hurts to watch, but whatever. Wish I had fuck you money lol
Waiting for ferrari to sue you. 😅🤣
Ferrari mulch incoming
If anything you should have made this an ad for the bubble thing 😂.  It took a real beating and didn’t break surprisingly
i'm thinking it needs wagon wheels
What an incredible commercial for XPEL!! 🤣🤣
Double it and give it to me!!!
This is like a real life game of forza
cease and desist boutta go crazy
Cant wait for the Bugatti
Definitely don't run it over with the tank

Lmao. Your most likely gona get a letter or 5 from Ferrari
Low-key I really feel like he’s ready to start a war. Do you not see all that military equipment sitting there?
I’m having surgery tomorrow and I’m worried so this video has given me 14 mins of laughter! Thank you Cody and the crew!
Well. That just happened.
this some gta stuff
reminds me of my driving in gta lol.... the car sounds the same as the game too!
dat bubble is hoss
That's just stupid. You could have used that money to completely change several people's lives forever. So pretty much a waste.
On the next episode of how many Car Brands can whistlin diesel piss off 😂
He started out with his pick up on his family’s farm to now off roading a Ferrari on his own mountain in like 5 years. He is him
Ur fucking awesome
Part 2?
cool and all, but will it float in the ocean?
After getting seued : guys I am filling for bankruptcy
That was awesome! The onslaught of items thrown at the car killed me😂
The company that made that car bubble, just got the best free ad of their life.
pov me playing FORZA
If there was a double like button I would have smashed it at least 3 times!  Nobody wheels a Ferrari but Cody.
Barrage in the Garage.
i love this s*** broo keep it up. on what if you put a lift kit in the front only
If that car cover company doesn’t license that content they are failing on so many fronts on a great product.
13:15 probably the funniest thing that I've ever seen on the internet!!
Bro destroys super cars for fun
When he jumped into the trunk 🤣😂🤣😂
I NEED MORE
Bro the ending of the video killed me 🤣🤣🤣😂😂
Do you know how bad of a role model this guy is too young teenagers? very dangerous Role model HE should be ashamed of Himself! The only reason other Youtubers collaborate with this dip shit is because it helps their channel the only reason! I still can’t believe there’s that many dumb ass is out there that love the shit! Why would anybody like the destruction of something so nice? I can see the destruction of like evil people but not things things that other people with dream to have and he just fucks shit up! Here’s a thought take that money and help the homeless now that’s doing something for the world that’s good instead of the shit you’re doing! Somebody needs to say this somebody that’s in the right mind that’s not a dumb ass!!!!!!
Ok wd have you not gone too far??  "Fuck nah" -wd
Hello this is bubba with Ferrari motor co. And you will be sued 99,999,9990 billion dollars.
Forza in real life
Every car manufacturer out there should send a car to WD for a month if he can drive it back to the manufacturer after thats month I'd want that car
It's getting harder and harder to find my Ferrari mulch. I hope that they are back in stock with it at the farmers market soon
Forza irl
That ending was EPIC!!!!
Can I have it?
Haha I love it 😂
Me in forza when im to lazy to take roads:
Pony
Imagine turning this into a squated Ferrari ahah raise the front tires and lower the back right down then it will make even more sense to destroy ahah
That’s the funniest fucking thing I’ve seen in my life😆🤣😂😆👍
Very funny !
Omg that ending was hilarious!!!!!  Holy sheeeeet funny!
Cody might die in this car…
Triggered
I gotta lie.. this didn't make me laugh at all. gotta be one of the worst videos on youtube i saw today. 🙃
10/10 for the bubble company
All jokes aside, I've always found it hilarious and ironic how with all these high-end cars like Ferarris, Lamborghinis, etc... you can barely even drive them it seems... because if you drive them for more than 50 miles a year you will be paying $25,000 for some services for regular stuff that shouldn't cost that much. Or you will be putting massive amounts of stress on their 250,000 dollar car's engine.   It's just comedy how some of these cars really aren't all that well-put together or how much these dealerships and companies scam people out of money for a car that you can barely drive without having issues or paying massive amounts of money for.  That being said... I am no where near close to being able to afford one lol. I love supercars and hypercars... I am a huge car enthusiast too and own a nice car. I just always find it funny hearing supercar owners complain about things and I find it funny how these cars aren't really meant to be driven like that.
Who ever breaks the Ferrari window gets a raise 😂
definitely going to get silenced by a ferrari hitman
Bro is literally playing Forza irl
You need to take it through the same pond that you did with the g wagon
Oh my, I cannot believe I'm about to watch him destroy this car.....lol............Ok, lets go......
Crazy! Another master piece of video.
Those Chinese spy bubbles are about to be sold out.
Deadass might go buy that protection bubble thing. Need me that car condom 😂
As much as I love this shit…it’s also painful to watch
Beyond impressed
I want to see what it looks like inside, really deep inside : )
The Ferrari lawyers are gonna have quite the surprise when they walk into work Monday morning
That’s better then any car you have lol and my dream car thing is sick man
Every car should come with one of those bubbles!!! 😂😂
4:38 is funny for some reason
How much money and how is he earning these freedom tickets to do this???
Are you allowed to put on some big thick ass tires to make make it a 4xFourrari 👹😉 kinda like what you used to do with things “ mechanically soup-em’ up” hahah
That is our generations FERRARI
😂😂😂
One of the best videos yet keep em coming young buck
The Ferrari bubble can withstand those tools but what if your toolbox falls on top of it?
What even is life when Whistlindiesel gets to do this and I have to go to work for 60hours a week.
TANK
Lmaoooo not an F8 😂 I know people about to be mad yes love it
run it over with monster max
Haha I know he don't give two shits and it's probably not true that they can actually keep you from buying one but I know for sure ferrari and ferrari people are furious and probably sending him a cease and desist, I seriously wouldn't put it past them
Tired of watching a 30 minute video of a guy sitting in his garage talking about how amazing is exotic car is but never even driving it. This is not that video.  Finally someone making exotic car videos worth watching.  Keep them coming.
Cody’s playing forza horizon 5 IRL.
This is next level and hilarious all at the same time. And why is it so good off-road? Lmao
Hey bro I need some cheering up family just decided to leave me after working my whole life for them I’m never gonna stop bugging you till you make me happier by destroying a Toyota Tacoma lol the Ferrari gave me a little giggle but I just feel like a yota is gonna be a great one unless you get a shit own and it does I’m 5 mins lol
Ken block who? Lol
Being a car guy! This is sickness  Why destroy  something so beautiful? Just for likes? This generation  is  really F up. Really  pathetic!
Him driving up the hill is exactly how the car  looks, driving up a mountain  in horizon 😆
holy crap I’ve been waiting for this video since I saw the Ferrari on insta and my expectations have been exceeded as usual with Cody
Cody is the King of YouTube!
Damn the last 40 seconds of this vid is one hell of an ad for whoever made that car bubble lmao
Yu should buy a lowerider bro you would luve it an to destroy
Video 0/10 not enough destruction, strongly recommend 👨‍🦽
the ending would have been even funnier if you threw that $30k light up nike boot at the ferrari lol
Cody, the ferrari is completely totaled. Please reach out to me I will get you an offer on it and cash you out.
🔥🤙💪💯💥🥳👍👌😉💯💪🤙🔥
Next Video: I Bought a 3.5 million buggati just to destroy it
Italians are douches.
When is the 747 durability test??
😂😂😂 Ferrari held up better then I thought
Youre now banned from purchasing a new ferrari from ferrari, lol
Straight to jail.....lol
I'd love one of those fender badges for my truck, see if Ferrari sues me for that!
Get Ferrari Enzo do this, see what happen 🤣🤣🤣
IN BEFORE THE C&D!
Not happy but not mad I know you don't care but I thought that that was actually really surprising it didn't die when it it the fence
ah brilliant, wait until Ferrari slaps that 5 million dollar lawsuit on you LOL...
Definitely need a bubble house sponsor to pay for the legal fees and the suing to come from Ferrari lol, the Bubble house was impressive, also those freedom factory races are paying off nice drivin
Don't do that to Doug! lmao He never hurt no one haha. That was great
Stop changing your thumbnail I'll watch it fuck
I feel like you need to take a page out of DDE, surprised you didn’t rip off the front splitter
It's called suface area. Look it up
A give away 😢
The bubble was unbelievably funny
This bro has an infinite money glitch i swear to god bro.
Just give it to me when your done! Thanks in advance 😁
I assume we can add another name to Ferrari's black list, you're in good company with Floyd Mayweather and Justin Bieber 👍
So ahhh whats with the million boxes haha
DID THE FURRIE MURDURE UR MUM OR SUMTHING WHAT DID IT DO?????????
As a Porsche and Ferrari owner this hurts but it was hilarious this guy is awesome
Love the video 🤣😅🤣🤣
This video gave me anxiety.
Ferrari: "AGGRESSIVE CEASE AND ASSIST LETER WRITING "
Bro is wrapped in 50k worth of car corver blanky🙌🤘🤣🤌
Ferrari should be paying him for this. lmao
I’m an aggot
The durability test this thing is going to see will make ferrari so proud. Oh wait Fuck ferrari!!!!
why is his head built so weird
Never mind
Good drifting
i said hammer not construction site
from 12:16 till the end of the video it crazy how much free advertisement the bubbles company got
That’s how it ended? My dick was so wet then completely limp
Well,  that bubble company owes you money.   This was the best promotional video they could have ever asked for 😂😂😂
I was having a panic attack the entire time ngl
cody may be the only person doing all the things he said he would do when he is a grown up in middle school
This is what forza horizon looks like in irl
🤙
Bros playing forza irl
That bubble shit is actually hella impressive withstanding all that
Fuck it up real nice and take it to the dealership
Enzo rolling is his grave
what happened to the r8 :(
IM CALLING THE POLICE RN -karen
Such a great video, had me rolling throughout the whole thing!
it would be cool to see you put money to good use for yourself, family or random people instead of wasting it
Do you know what I am just like you I destroyed a minivan we’re at the point the roof started caving in so yeah and now you’re doing my thing yeah🤘🤘🏻👍🏻
Now that was good entertainment.  Now give me a hammer was awesome.  I really thought the next move was to drop some totes off the back wall on it because that stack is a legitimate threat.    Ferrari could use this in advertising to show the car is actually pretty durable cept for the key fob.  I doubt a C8 would withstand this treatment.
Thanks to WhistlinDiesel i am going to buy myself a Ferrari tomorrow, I am highly impressed on how durable, capable and controllable it is.
u r the best youtuber, along wit cboys
Yeah baby we called it, I see a Bugatti coming in the "near" future
Ferrari mulch when?
When your finished with it send it to me
This man is the embodiment of no fucks given. I love it.
Please keep this car like the Lambo bro clean and safe
Seriously impressed by the offroad capability of that thing. Doing stuff most trucks with A/T tires would struggle to do with RWD and road performance tires is insane.
Fuck it hurts to watch this 🤦🏻‍♂️
bro is actually so good at driving, i wouldve crashed 46 times
The amount of scammers trying to say.  You are special you've won a truck or this car blah blah BS.  Oh yeah you've won a free hot sandwich 🥪 maker with DD's who is mute and has no gag reflex. RIGHT (Dr. Evil voice )
I THINK IT SHOULD BE WIDE-BODIED...IT'S WHAT ALL THE COOL GUYS ARE DOING...COMPLETED IN HOUSE OF COURSE
TaxTheRich did it first lol
What a great commercial for the car bubble
When he pushed the cart into the Audi, the other guy just added that to the cost of the video 💀
These guys are really doing forza stuff irl
Streetspeed717- I’m going to off-road a c8 Whistindiesel- hold my lawsuit
This is literally forza horizons in real life
that bubble is actually kinda sick
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣.
It's like he's playing forza horizon 5 irl
i want to buy a case
Ferrari is going to want to kill you. 🤣🤣
At least someone is living our dream🤣
the last 20 seconds of those video had me in tears from laughing so hard. been a long time since I’ve laughed that hard
Why do we watch this? This is my first and last of this channel. He’s literally perpetuating what is wrong with our world. Dumb as F he is! Good for you making millions on being a wasteful idiot. Your contribution to the world and man kind could have been soo much more for man kind but you decided to squander it.  It’s definitely taxing on your soul. You could have made several videos to this one that helped people and received many more views.
Was actually wild to watch
The ending had my 9 year old dying 😂
The air compressor threw me out my seat oh my goodness
If they don’t pay you for the best advertisement ever sue lmaooo makes me want a bubble more than ever
Phone call from Ferrari in 3-2-  keep doing what you do hahaha
The random doug demuro clip killed me 😭
You have have officially out daily driven exotic the daily driven exotic crew 😂😂😂
The firing range at the end was awesome 👍
I think I need that bubble... lol expensive?
lemme get that ferrari
Finally a big ol' Ferrari F U! Their attitude is such crap.
The capability of the ferrari you showed in this video is better than any ad ferrari themselves have put out
GET A Koenigsegg!!!
Got some real TaxTheRich vibes from seeing Cody do donuts at the top of the hill.
Why wait test it against monstermax with the bubble test then give it a ride on the Blackhawk and release it gotta test the shocks two
Time to bring out the 50 cal.. fuck the law suits , it's all about views.
Y’all trippin tbh
Man’s unhinged
Cody idk you’re up there with hail melon you’re the fckin man 😂😂😂
Finally someone having real fun with a Ferrari
Can we all just admit that Cody is legit a great driver…
this is literally Forza irl
I cringed the whole time lol. Love it though  lol
That air bubble is a good unit
Now to keep you from destroying that car you need to drive it with that balloon around it lol 😆
Absolutely hilarious! Love the fact that he is genuinely impressed when it actually makes it 10 minutes without falling apart. Love this! Keep sending it!
What a channel 😂
This is awesome
I’m excited for this video, but even more curious to see how many views this one will achieve in 24hrs! Brilliance at work ! Nice job Cody
Excited to see what’s next
Lamborghini carcover immediately.  = EPIC
Why did the farrari have a Lamborghini cover
This is literally the first time I've ever seen Cody without a hat
It’s funny asf people getting butt hurt over just testing the durability of stuff
Dudes living life like GTA 👏🏼
Shoot give me $400,000 I'll buy land and build a house.
Please lift this thing dude! Ferrari will cry
He doing what we do in gta in real life😂
Is this a ferrari durability or a bubble durability test😭😭😭
Cut the body off and turn it into a kart
The end is pure art.
Thickk - fila
Pov my gta character
The filming crew 🤌🤌
bros playing forza irl
4:10 sounded like the Pixar intro 😂
Damn I cant watch this, hurts the soul 😂
We all said “It’s a drain!” at the same time.
Omg that was a flickin' hilarious it's like when you on a rollercoaster when you ticklin' in tha stomach and down under u know, you ever disappoint oh buddy old pal. Cant wait till the next one 👍it's like shit'n a shit of bitches sucker ma' stomach 😅
Just curious how are you able to blow so much money and not go broke? Are you a trust fund baby? Lotto winner..? WHAT?🤣😆
Ferrari with Ferrari cover❌ Ferrari with Lamborghini cover✅
Im just waiting on the tank to be on the us
Best Ferrari commercial hands down.
I was so happy when I saw this come out, I can’t wait to watch it
You sold me on the bubble car wrap
What’s in all the military looking tubs?!
A little disappointed they didn't include an anvil in the tool toss! 😆
Dope
Dear lord… this is an absolutely dream😂
The Ferrari so far is impressive, but the bubble cover was super impressive!
Real life Forza Horizon
Man I thought you were gone brocked from them shoes
This one is going to piss alote of people off lol .And i love it keep up the good work..
Thank you so much for making this😂😂😂😊😊 the bubble wrap! Was so great
Part 2
This isn't a review of a red Ferrari... This is a review of the Ferrari Spy Balloon!
The ending was hilarious 😅😅😅
I don't know how the end of this video turned into the worlds most durable tent
Thing sounds so mean tho
Wow, that’s a cool fast red sports car!!   …..I bet he gets sued…..    🤣😂🤣😂
6:57 That was some Gymkhana move lol
its the lambo sto cover for me 😂
Literally me in Forza😂
Please put mud tires on it!
The Doug DeMuro “THIIIIIS” had me dying
What an absolute lunatic. Love it
Dude never ceases to amaze me. Most original guy on YouTube. Please keep making great stuff.
Like he said "Red is Dead"...
I don’t care what anyone says, this is art. I have followed this channel since close to day 0. Now we have reached like Tropic Thunder levels of commentary on society and consumerism and I love it.
Playing forza irl
Pure gold! I'm sold on the car bubble !
He can drift
When the codes started popping up all I could think was who is the poor sap with a scanner that has to navigate Ferrari's 1000 control modules lol  Also, the spy balloon website got me. Good one lol
Cody you're a price! Bit what you do is obviously working for you!  Its all in good fun but after awhile its one in the same!! Be a real bad ass and buy a something people you care about and you the same and do it in front of people who care!!
If it can survive WhistlinDiesel, its worth buying.
I need that freaking bubble thing, if only I knew where to get one 🤔
This is Art. Bravo!

Playing forza IRL
That’s my favourite video as from now
Careful I think I saw a video in your sponsors
I think lawsuits too y did u make me wait so long for upload
Great video
.. Boring..  (;
The ending was the best
Damn you are a pretty good rally driver
Nice video with SUEssie the rarri 😈
Damn
No motorized vehicle enthusiast of any kind is safe 😂
Must be nice to have daddy's money 💰 🤑 💸    HAHAHA JUST FUCKING WITH YA
Take off the uniform and kevlar helmet dude. Some of us earned that right. Not you
The cheese finally slipped off the cracker.
every super car owner is cringing rn
2for1 deal, tested Ferrari and bubble car cover
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I’m dead
Sell it in jars
So GTA V was right. Exotics make the best off-roaders.
The only thing questionable about this is what Ferrari is gonna do after watching this video 💀🤣 If they even find out
Another impressive video! Keep up the Durability test videos. They are comical and interesting. However, it would be a lot cooler if you uploaded videos that are not 2 weeks to a month out. 😑
Taking the piss out of doug in the 3rd minute was so funny 😂
Ferrari = plastic.  I’ll take a 2003 carmy over this foreign trash
When he says the word Ferrari I just say what Ferrari?
You should take it back to the old days and put buggy wheels on it
Reminds me of those Tax the Rich videos..     nevermind
sales of blow up car shields are going to go through the roof now...
What the hell is in all the military looking cases in your garage? Wondering minds gots to know!
Cody driven it like it’s forza
I can't believe I watched through 7 minutes before remembering to like and comment!!!!!
Cease-and-desist any% speedrun
Who copied who? StreetSpeed 717 copy WhistlinDiesel or the other way around? HMMMMMM
I'll take the Losi Baja Rey that got tosssed at the bubble lol
I was really hoping he would take it to dealer for service (before he cleaned it) and told them that he was hearing a noise.
I’m certain you will get many lawsuits from Ferrari! #1 it was instant, you covered it wit a Lamborghini cover…
Brother,.. the squatting of trucks in NC is back on the rise. Please do something.
how much ladder does he own 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
HOW COULD YOU NOT LOVE THIS M...................F.........
This dude playing forza IRL
That car balloon is actually impressive.
Best commercial for a car bubble I have ever seen
I’ll buy when you sell it 😂
Will the bubble protect it if a g wagon came crashing through the roof on it?
7:57 when I don’t feel like following the road on forza
How can someone get copyrighted for putting a Perrari badge on a car THAT THEY BOUGHT WITH THEIR OWN MONEY
Gta real life
This is awesome, can't wait for the Bugatti
That shoutout to Doug lmfao
I don't think Ferrari would be upset 🤣
The ending was hilarious
Born a little shit ahead I'm sure, just a little douche bag now.
Ferrari=shit
“Can’t wait to wreck a Ferrari on my way to rehab”
The only Thing that I didn't see thrown at it, was the kitchen sink..😂🍻🍻
that bubble is actually impressive
Man’s living real life gta
Cody. You should start a live show of you wrecking stuff. Either that or pay per view events.
Cody never disappoints. Bravo sir 👏
Plot twist Cody owns that bubble company and bought the Ferrari just to make that ad 👀
❤
Ferrari won’t sue you for this, it’s literally free promo
You're the craziest person I know. FREAKING LOVE IT!!!! Keep the the crazy content
for the algorithm
Yes... Just YES
from what i have seen so far, this car would make a decent work truck
Forza in real life
this is the greatest Ferrari Torture Test of All Time
13:17 - 4:11 I couldn't breathe
Why did the Ferrari have a Lamborghini cover?
for the algo
Host a demolition derby
Sam Hyde crossover would have me drenched
lmfao at the doug demurio "this is"
The ending is the best. Fuckin hilarious
Yes🤓more bubble testing 💩
The guy buying the exhaust and then seeing this video gonna be like bro 😭😭
The fucking end of the video was unnecessarily funny af!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
PLEASE TELL ME DDE OR STRADMAN IS IN THESE COMMENTS 😂😂😂😂
He totally spit all over that horse’s dick!!! Hahaha
The cupcake baking tray at the end 🤣🤣
Hahaha now that was a legit video. Keep it up whistlin D!
The amount of random crap thrown at the end had me crying 😂😂
Seeing him beat on such an amazing car seriously hurts…..BUT IT SURE IS ENTERTAINING!
I felt that gate .
Yes but, can it take a jump....
The Doug cameo really made me laugh
Best video ever
I don't wana watch but I can't not ahhh
Quality content
I wander if a Ferrari can water skip
Ferrari vs mud pit???
W TOP G!
I guess gta wasn’t totally unrealistic when I was off-roading in my Ferrari
I gotta lie, I'm really impressed
Yeah, the end when he threw everything at it, I had tears in my eyes that was hilarious!!!!!!
Love how people were complaining saying you would've bought a "cheap 458" and destroyed it, But instead you went out your way to buy a brand new 400k ferrari f8 just to prove them wrong. This is why im subbed to the channel, Cant wait to see what you do with this one🔥
Forza in real life
the amount of cars in his shop now, wow
Man sometime it’s hard to watch this channel and today was one of those times
Take it to Taewell Speedway in Tazewell, TN.  See what kind of lap time you can get.  I've been curious about how that would go in a sports car since I was like 8 years old in the stands there.
Videos just don't seem as good as they were
best video yet
Cody needs his check for the free advertising on that car bubble. That shit is legit!
Thanks for doing this man, so that I wouldn't have to.  Saves me an easy 400K
Cody just had more fun with his Ferrari in 14 minutes than anyone ever has before. He genuinely enjoys these cars to their fateful end.
The Ferrari rallying was actually pretty rad
Nah fr rip WD Ferrari
Quite possibly unintentional but this was actually exceptional advertisement for the bubble
I'll give you $6.39 and a gallon of maple syrup for that poor Ferrari...although it took the pounding well
Cant belive ive watched homie come this far, all thanks to the haters and morons. Hell yea man keep it up
You look like you bite... But like... Not in a good way.
I'm absolutely laughing my ass off. This is probably one of my most favorite videos yet.
All hail the Fer-rally
Hands down  best YouTube creator.
That F8 sounds good
Absolutely the funnest videos made. @whistlindiesel I’m jealous
Stick that in your pipe and smoke it dde 😂
I hate ferrari as a brand but fuck that looks glorious yeeting around the field. Edit: How many people did you have throwing shit at that bubble? :')
He’s playing forza irl
Ferrari emerged from this video looking better than when they went in.
This video is pure satisfaction!! You surpassed my expectations haha!
Give me a hammer scene was great!! Hahaha
I need to see the behind the scenes when they throw all the things at the bubble 😂😂😂
You need to take ot to ferrari for a service for a reaction once it's all banged up.
So how much did it cost you   crew to rent this bitch?
How many people were involved in throwing all that 😂
Whistling diesel is the bull and the red cars make angry
I just realized why these videos have grown on me so much - you've basically created your own meme universe and it's hilarious. The cuts to previous events are quick and witty, and out of context they are even funnier, they kill me hahaha good stuff guys, thanks.
That car bubble is the real star
@busted knuckle films sell him a buggy
Ohh shit this is going to be good
Gta5 in real life 😂😂
epic & if anything this is promo for Ferrari
I fuckin live for this content
NOW IF YOU GAVE THE CAR AWAY AND I WAS THE ONE TO GET IT THEY REALLY WOULD BE MAD LOL GREAT VIDEO
Your garage is looking sick as
At 12:26 the kid is Tunerworld
Sometimes I just forget this dude can actually drive and I get pleasantly surprised.
If you keep this up, in a few years you’re going to have to buy a yacht and hit an island or something. Quite the progression from the trucks through the mud. Great job
What car collectors dread doing to their car
Buy a dirt truck a trophy truck
just don't do a travis pastrana on your passenger...
Looks like a perfect demolition derby rig to me……
Whistlelen
Unironically a good ass advertisement for that protector bubble thing for cars really puts it to the test unlike others...
Not a true torture test till you shoot it with a 50 cal
Forza  horizon in real life 😂😂😂
I wouldn't even drive my disgustingly beat up 2004 suburban like that.... respect
Grow up Cody. Love, dad.
That perfect Ferrari didn't deserve that.....now it's perfectly imperfect🥺
Honestly so proud of Cody, from where he has came from and what he started out with, congratulations on the Ferrari Cody!💯💪🏽
Need to buy a busted knuckle rock bouncer and do a durability test and see just how strong they are.
You should have shot it (machine gun preferably) in the last scene...     That would have been epic..
Your Honor it’s just like filming an action move that destroys cars, the only difference is that i give it to the world via Youtube and not the theaters.
The end was the best ad the bubble people could have ever asked for😂
His brand at this point is mostly pointing out the superficial nature of the things so many people put on a pedestal.
Looks like he might have a serious ammo collection 😳
Enjoy tearing up things that would be life changing for me. I have cancer and I have nothing left in life. I can't watch this shit anymore. Have fun.
He is literally him
Now that's a cliff hanger, what happens next?!?!😂😂
This shit is funny .. slamming the front hood cracked me up hahahaha
Oh hell yeah. Don't let anybody ruin your day. Be a man, do it yourself. 🫡
ill trade my 2009 bmw
So if you buy a ferrari, ferrari still owns it??
This is just a destruction channel now.
Never disappointing. Awe-inspiring.
These videos never disappoint!!! Absolutely love to see it
I just became a fan.
Quite possibly my favorite video yet.  Throwing things at a Ferrari in a bubble... I don't know which I want to see more, the bubble survive, or the car not!
If you don't like this dude's cool ass videos.   You are the one that is wrong.
The one person thats truly showing that nothing is worth as much as you pay for it an its not worth it. Fuck yeah @whistlindiesel
Ferrari lawyers getting called in the middle of the night hahaha
Just literally looked at a meme about this few days ago
been waiting for the supercar destruction congratualtions
We should do a Harley Davidson destruction collaboration. We got banned just for sharing a sportster burnout on the fan club.
Better content then Mr beast hands down  Need more merch!!!
this channel lost focus . I'm out. struggle to pay my bills this makes me ill
If you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a bullet 😂😂😂
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAA!😋
Daddy doesnt have enough money for a koenigsegg l, so he had to get the Ferrari
You made something hot turn into something sexy
💯💯💯
Best one yet long live wistlen
Your best one yet!!!!    The pain in ferrari lovers hearts and minds is going to be epic...   Oh, and the ferrtardi law department...
3:19 is what you all came for!!! THIIIIISSSS
I thought super cars needed to be modified, something like Singer does, in order to drive on very rough roads. Thans for proving me wrong.
Keep up the great work. Vinnie G.  Seattle Washington
Man’s playing Forza IRL
yall missed like half the shit yall threw at the bubble  😁🤭
Man I'm soooo jealous.............
I love it Fu3k Ferrari
WOow! The new Forza Horizon graphics look incredible
Now this is the best video I’ve seen yet😂😂
"I feel like the driver warming should be. You could get sued"  spot on bevan
Probably the 1st owner to take a Ferrari to the rev limiter! On ya Cody 👌🏻👌🏻
Diesel conversion?
The REAL product here is the bubble garage
Destroying super cars my favorite hobby
Post link for that bubble!!!!! Start selling them on your website for sure they're the most indestructible thing you've had on here
A fool and his money are soon parted………🤣🤣🤣
PLEASE DESTROY TESLA!!!!
omg where the fuck do you get so much shit to throw at the end LMAO! its like an entire Home Depot lended you their staff to each throw 5 items at the car. that was hilarious
Keep it up. Super yachts next 😂
Love this
Man, this is the best car bubble test ever
12:29 WWE! CM Punk! LOL
Please lift it and make it the first moster ferrari
damn that bubble held up
I think you just completed the best advertisement for that bubble ever
Quick call to the insurance company and good as new!!!  Definitely not a NORMAL WD video.   NO DROP?
forza 5 IRL
This is a great advertisement for Ferrari.
Need the moree 😂
I am going to sue Whistling Diesel for too much good content..
@DailyDriveExotics cheap Ferarri for sale, never been abused, garage kept.
The screams after he chucks something off camera during the bubble test.... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The design team.   Who can we have test this car.   I think I know a guy
I am a simple man, I see whistlindiesels video, I watch, I I like it
Pure genius.  Don’t ever change.
This is the move that made Ferrari cry
I’m from ohio and those train crashes got nothing on this🤣
I love seeing you destroy the reverence around these expensive cars by being the only one bold enough to do what no one else would dare to
I'll be visiting the Fiorano Circuit in the near future to service some of our equipment at Ferrari R&D. Can't wait to show them this video but I'm sure they are already aware.  Excellent content!
Best 14 minutes and 11 seconds I've waited a week for😂🤜🤛😂
Reminds me of the Yt channel “Tax the Rich” back in the last decade 😂
This is the definition of Forza in real life.
I love this
*I Could have Driven That Before i Die of Cancer*
They literally threw everything at the Bubble except for the Kitchen Sink, lolol...
They really said “ let’s get the most random items and just throw them at this bubble thing”
I feel dirty doing this shit in GTA V and here u are doing it IRL))))
Doing everything we all wish we could do
THE DOUG DEMURO ONE 😂😂😂 THIS 😅
I want to see how far he’ll take this lol,  nut up champ and put her through the fucking ringer while listening to Phil Collins
We you get a ferrari in asphalt 8… great video cody!! Please, please keep em coming!! Best YouTube in my opinion
Ferrari needs to join rally raceing
6:36 “There are some sensors that are very sensitive” Oh, shit fr? I didnt know that.
As someone who'll never afford one, 10/10.
Total moron 🤦‍♂️😂
This car finding out WhistlinDiesel was its new owner must be like finding out your adoptive mother is Casey Anthony.
Only guy ever to actually have fun with a car like that and not treat it like it’s something it’s not.
He so good at this just all the different pieces that go in to the videos hahah he’s a legend for sure
The 🐐 … can’t wait for the Bugatti video
I wounder if it can drive off a trailer like your g wagon did
Cody: Buys a Ferrari and actually drives it. Ferrari: Yeaaa.... u have to stop this.
Will 35 inch tires fit without trimming bumpers? Lol
That car sounds damn good.
Love how this guy is the Project Farm of cars. awesome video keep it up
Koenigsegg durability test?
I love ferraris and I love that you added one to your collection. Here's to the upcoming durability testing! This is exactly what the world needed
We must protect Whistlin Diesel at all costs bois
IF IT'S RED, ITS DEAD - WhistlinDiesel
Bugatti rn: 😅😅😅😅
Get the Ferrari, Hurucan, and r8 and recreate the taxtherich100 supercar rally video
Ending was 😂🎉
I'm glad you destroyed it. That thing was junk
I love it a car being used as it should be
I hate Ferrari so I’ve been waiting a long time for this video
Jump it like the general lee
I hope in the future people will look at this in the literary sense and ask what he meant by it.... my hopes is one child will raise his hand and say, "Because he wanted to have fun."
I’m almost disappointed in how well it held up.
Let me pour your driveway in concrete
Forza horizon irl
Should've put a video of everyone chucking random stuff at the car that would've been epic 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I heard these things do very well in the sand dunes
I hope this ends up in little jars when it's all said and done!
The stupidest video I ever seen on YouTube, have no idea how or why this was recommended 🤦🏾‍♂️
Man is playing Forza in real life
forza be like:
We love how durable it is, and we love the car. But we have to know how “durable” it really is.
very funny content also sick driveway  and offroading
13:24 literally one of those freakin scenes out of looneytunes.   Have never laughed so damn hard.
3:20🤣🤣🤣
when it comes to throwing tools across a workshop, i can attest to the effectiveness of the old 4 point ninja star wheel braces.
10
I feel like you went easy on this car and Im starting to question if you are bought out and sponsored.
CAN YOU PLEASE PUT THE DAMN SHREDDER WHEELS ON IT!!! OR MAYBE THE AMISH WHEELS? OR... MAYBE... BOTH?!?!?!?!
How is the car bubble the most durable thing this channel has seen😂
Tell my why it looks so natural off road😂
That thing really did hold up pretty well. They really put a lot of engineering into that thing.
I swear this guy is just MTV's Jackass, 20 years later.  And, instead of a daredevil cast injuring themselves, he "injures" expensive possessions.  Still love what he's doing!
Yesss 😂 I’ve been waiting for this forever. So glad it’s going to be a series

I just want everyone in this comment section to know, that Ferrari doesn’t stand a chance soon 💀
You know you are going to hell for this one !!! And you definitely ain’t getting into the new system !!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This genuinely made me cry
WhistlinDiesel did not kill himself
Your allowed to crash, just not modify it. Makes sense. lol
you need to do a infocomercial for this air car cover !!!
Throwing everything at the bubble wrap, freaking hilarious 😂😂 prolly had like 5 guys with loads of stuff stacked up ready to throw lol
Drop it from a helicopter 🤘🏻😏
When every video you make is Legendary, where do you go from here? The International Space Station We need Cody in space. It could be Space X or Roscosmos but our boy needs to be off the planet.
Watching this before it gets removed
OK so after you destroy it please make a video of you fixing it
I was waiting for the crates in the back to fall.
WD is out there, he can't be bargained with, he can't be reasoned with, he doesn't feel pity or remorse, or fear and he absolutely will not stop. *EVER.*
Does it have sand mode?
This is how it should be driven! Bravo sir! 👏
Holy shit.
Spacers pls ..all of them
How to get banned from Ferrari

You can’t even hate, he got where he is today because he’s creative and intuitive!
Damn thank you I laughed the whole time. That bubble held way better then I would have ever thought LMAO 😂

Kind of hard to watch lol. Glad you're doing this though. For science.

The bubble did its job!
Put some mud tires on it.
Can't wait for the next video 😎😎😎
He NEEDS to buy a Hummer H2
Homies banned from Ferrari
I'm actually really pumped for ferarris reaction....
I hope you got paid well from the bubble people. You just Sold a lot of those. Honestly I don't even think you Were Trying. I didn't mean to suggest it was marketing. you were just being funny and realistic. I think you indirectly proved how great they are.
He is basically living the Forza Horizon life
He now has a FerRALLY car... get it...
BEST VIDEO YOUVE EVER DONE 😂😂
Forza Horizon IRL. So cool to watch you rip trails in the rain.
wow man what a crazy carrrrrr cant think of a better owner tbh @whistilindiesel for sure the most expencive red out there lol
Remember, only a missile can take down a Chinese spy balloon
We could even buy two and absolutely destroy one I think that would be such a good time since I'm just as destructive as you its my dream car
My ribs hurt from laughing so hard. Fu(#ing sh!t 🤣
WDs got more money in those Pelican cases than the Ferrari
Me wondering the entire time what in them cases
This is rly hard to watch but also very entertaining, thank you for keeping my dream car alive for longer than one video cody. P.S. Crazy to see how far you've come congrats on ur success
God bless this man
I wouldn't even do this in Forza 🤣
The last 45 seconds was so unbelievably funny😂😂😂

How tf was that bubble so good??????
13:10 WRENCH FIGHT REFERENCE!
mans playing Forza Horizon 5 irl
the end where they throw the parts reminds me of chick hicks when he wins the race in Cars and they just toss the trophy at him lol
Doesn't seem that long ago  we were watching a kid doing burnouts over rat traps. Oh how our little Cody has grow. Almost puts a  tear in my eye.  No, wait,,,, it was just dirt.
This guy is a genius
How are u the bestest of drivers ;)
Bro has more faith in his lawyers than I have in myself
Baddest looking rally car ever. Rally set up on it if it's still running that is. 🤘
😂😂😂😂
When you geta cease and discist from Ferrari, just reply with 'k' and then run over the car with monstermax
2:49 Ferrari starts writing C&A letter, Nobody f*cks our hoods with Fiji water bottles, nobody, unless using aquafina bottles...
They gotta raise the price on that bubble protector whistlin proof😅 the stock price ⬆️🚀
Run it over with Monster Max??
all the city kids getting mad at a machine that costs less then my family's cotton picker
Watch my videos i wanna ferrari lol
we love you CODY!!!, alright
I'm about to be real disappointed if Ferrari can't make it 14 minutes with WD
I think you should get me a 400000 Ferrari so I can drift it
As your name says " Whistlin  DIESEL DIESEL DIESEL, lifted turbo d 4wd and still GREEN
love this shit!!!
Cummins swap it
Has it made it to sticky buttons yet or not?
I was expecting where u destroy the ferrari like what u did on the nissan gtr 😂
Oh god........THANK YOU!!!!! THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS.  THIS WAS GREAT.  yes, it was screaming worthy.
He lost his 10mm at the end
I wish I could watch this for the first time again. Literally the best video ever. So many laughs.
I need a new audi rs3 and its like 75k and your just destroying stuff worth over four times as much want to help me get one instead 😂
This is awesome.. I really do wonder if Ferrari will do anything or just take the money and ban you from buying any other Ferrairs.
I go on Youtube and the first thing I see is a guy destroying a $400,000 Ferrari, yet here I am enjoying the video.
You had my undivided attention on this video, nice work man
Absolutely fantastic. You deserve all of this ❤
Damn! I'll never be rich enough to buy and then destroy a Ferrari just for fun.
just here for the lawsuit XD
How much trouble can you get into. More than Andrew Tate?!  They might claim RAPE!!!
I am scared to know what he will buy next, A Mclaren F1 MAYBE!!! I dont freaking know.
Can’t wait for the Chiron durability test
Throwing all that shit at the bubble lmao
Whistlin Diesel does what we all do in GTA 5. But in real life
Needs to be a new Consumer Reports category….How well it survived Whistlindiesel….
Bubble goated
13:39 damn, that's a well made bubble.
Well that’s what you call a great product review (for the bubble) purrari can piss off
Yall just need a machine that launches heavy objects from ground. Crush that damn Ferrari like a Coca-Cola can
Finally proper Ferrari test
We got the government watching your every move
Imagine Cody did daily bangers like this😮
Absolutely impressed with the hill climb
Such a douch bag though still watching
You forgot the kitchen sink lol
Bro my back literally started crying when I saw you throwing those ladders lol I have sciatica...
How many ladders do you have?
Lawsuit incoming for sure.
So what the fuck was 10:30 about?
Ayooo people with money all over are gonna want that car bubble after what you just showed it can do at the end!🤣
that last 60 seconds has me dying laughing!!!!!  keep up the good work Cody and crew!!!!
Lol this one is gonna hurt 😭
Ferrari must be cramping there pants right now
Letssss goooo
They must have done that for when you're like rock crawling 🤣
Absolutely hilarious and always it turns out Cody shows just how oddly capable the vehicles he tests are lol  Imagine the plot twist of him doing ferrari factory durability tests in the future 😂
this was a great ad for ferrari and the car bubble
I like video like this
you know Ferrari had a hemorrhoid after seeing this video
Should have bought the @goonzsquads rebuilt Ferrari
Click bait
Bruh, 400,000 dollars to destroy a Ferrari. What a legend! The amount of work is crazy. Keep up the good work.
I was really waiting for a truck to ram the Ferrari in the bubble.
that's a cool fast sports car!!!!
Think about how many homeless children could have eaten your Ferrari!
Weak...run over 10,000 rubber chickens and make a parody!
Sick!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Gonna tell my kids this was Doug DeMuro
That car cover company should see a 500% increase in sales after this video
my guy is gonna be on death row because of this video💀💀
If GTA was really life
Lol. Ferrari never even heard of WD before this. Now they're probably having meeting on how to proceed.
Bro live a gta life
I replayed numerous times I didn’t see when throwing items at bubbled Ferrari a kitchen sink. I mean you did throw everrything might as well throw the kitchen sink at it!  Love the content keep it up.
Well done video
Quality content
That bubble was actually impressive!
5 minutes into the video whistlin crossed off everything “crazy” that has been done in any other Ferrari
After the watching this kid, the saying life is what you make it is a understatement ♥️
Cody f###ing love it full send that thing
You know I dislike super rich people but I could never hate wistlin he's for the people
Give me a hammer is my new favorite phrase. It replaces i gotta lie
Ferrari is probably raging
Drive a rally car through Miami
Nice ending.
My heart 😂😂😂
I’m kinda a car person and this made me cringe but it was funny
What military vehicle is coming next? Bigger helicopter?
Not gonna lie this one hurt to watch
"Ferrari lawyers have entered the chat"
Do the explosive bow again Cody!
First video that kinda hurt my soul 🤣 car is soo sick. Video is hilarious though either way 🤣🤣🤣
"F8 Ferrari Literally Tills Dirt, bruh" with the spike tires
The destruction has just started and this has got to be in the top 10 videos thus far
I get it's for content and shit, but this really hurt to watch.
I wish I had that much money
all those crates next to the Ferrari are RPG rockets and small arms ammo. Trespassers beware
Maybe china needed that balloon. Seems durable enough!
Lawsuit time guy you’d better be scared guy!
Youtubes been doing that unconsentual unsubscribing stuff again… maybe Ferrari had a hand in it 🤔
This is fricken hilarious 😂
Epic video 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
This is the only way to deal with a Ferrari
The rain looks like FORZA, doesnt even look real...  Had to edit: if that car cover company doesn't sponsor you they are CRAZY.
Great Grand Finale at the end..
Im impressed how well that thing did.
If the company that makes that car bubble does not use this as a advertisement  for their product I will be disappointed.
This video is so so funny 🤣 fantastic job keep it up brilliant 👏 👍 👌....amazing..
honestly, the car bubble is kinda good.
Gets better every video
if its red its dead
Now do Square tires on it
When he drew the horse dick, I subbed
I’m glad to see the little plastic man made the trip home to the new shop. I remember him from when he dented the Hellcat 😂
GIMME A HELL YEAH
Literally just this morning I checked your channel to see if you posted anything and I thought I’m sure he’s probably just working on a great video
Pop goes the diesel.
that bubble is really good
Every Ferrari owner needs to watch this.
Fuckin A bro... That shit was great... Throwing all the stuff seemed like a family guy joke for how long it went for. 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣
The 🐐 of YouTube
That last bit had my crying. I was expecting a matco toolbox to drop from the ceiling tbh.
I wonder how he makes so much money to justify busting these expensive cars!?? Idk but I hope he gets 100x more
Love this. Missed this
Seeing how I will never be able to own one, this was somewhat satisfying.
It needs the Amish touch😂
Hahaha.... Damn guys sounded out of wind there at end after throwing all that stuff. 😂🤣😂🤣
13:17 👁👁
mans literaly doin forza horizon in real life
umm when did this guy become cool? now I guess
That was fucking awesome😂
this is what ss717  was trying to beat eith a cheapo c8 lmfao
This makes me smile so big.
Someone at Ferrari needs to hire this man to do there testing,I think he does a great job at it,he knows how to show what a car can do or not do, and  in my opinion that's a plus in the auto industry, great job my man,looking forward to more video's
Forza irl
This guy has major balls
That car bubble was kind of impressive.
Lift kit in the front
Hilarious ending 😂😂 sales of those balloons about to go through the roof
swap the ferrari engine to monster max
Everyone behind these videos and what this channel has become. Genius
Epic!
I challenge you to make a super cars tug of war, like the Ferrari vs the lambo or r8 vs Ferrari
ive seen F40 , F50 and a Enzo ''off roading'' gentley
YESSIR 😎
LMAOOOO when you guys started throwing tools it reminded me of the old garage when you guys would throw them at each other.
my man is playing Forza Horizon in real life
3k miles very used what a scam
Starting to become the same boring crap …
Haha. The end is like watching Dodge Ball where Patches Ohoolihan is throwing wrenches at the players.  If you can dodge a wrench... You can dodge a ball.  Lol
Simply beautiful man. Lift kit and train horn  please
Please Cody, pick It up with your giant excavator and swing it around like a toy car making funny noises
Just let me borrow 10 grand man I'll pay u back I work full time i just need a little help right now.
Feels like forza type shit
but can you drive the ferrari out of the bubble?  the inside may be its weakness
Definitely needs more durability testing.
Throw som filets of samon in under seats and let them marinate then invite different people to go for a spin while you wear a breathing apparatus...the usual also have it valet'd at an upscale restaurant etc.......the "pewrarri"
I can see the hater's tears 🤣🤣👍
That ending 😂
Waitin on the Bugatti next!?
The end was the best lmfao😂😂😂
12:15 💀
Ferrari executives watching this like:👁️👄👁️
I was laughing out loud throughout this whole video 😂. Great job man, I love it!
If you ever need to rebuild your Ferrari let me know
I feel like I just watched my self play Forza
Rip to the rari, she had a short life but at least she was driven 3k miles.
Bros bouta get banned from buying one ever again, supprised they let you buy in the first place
Was dying the whole video 💀 💀
Awesome,awesome awesome.
man is going to get sued by Ferrari
Forza in real life🤣🤣
Man I love when you destroy things but this one hurt a bit lol
Slap some 44in boggers on back of that bad boy
Yes 🥲😂
Im not gonna lie. When you were unloading the shop on it I was yelling shoot it shoot it lol. That would have been awesome in true cody fashion 🤣🤣
This somehow never gets old
Up to about 5:30 is honestly how I feel like supercars should be used… and yes the “goggly eyes” are included in that. Because that’s fun and why do that have to be kept like a painting when they’re designed to be used. Mostly.
take it to the dunes and see if you can jump it over higher than the g wagon
We all thought this video was about a Ferrari, but Chinese weather balloon car protectors are about to sell out😳
Best Ferrari video on YouTube
Next up G5 jet?
Awesome video!!!!
I’m buying that car bubble thing right now
Gattdam!!!! I was waiting for someone to throw the kitchen sink at it!
That car cover gets an A ++++++
I'm just impressed that bubble actually held up and works.
My man playing Forza Horizon irl
You got to start doing videos like “taxtherich” does with the cars before you fully destroy them that would be whicked footage and you get to drive the dog shit out of them
I'm pausing the video right now to write this. When you said "give me a hammer" and the onslaught afterward.... you sir win the internets for today!
Hi
V8 power
I love this man
I hope he wins the lawsuit
Will he shoot the balloon containing the car with 50cal before or after he drives the tank over it?
love it. you are living the dream of letting the intrusive thoughts win! bravo sir. keep up the good work!
I love Whistlindiesel destroying fancy cars just for the sake of it.
I loved every bit of this fucking pure gold bro
Aaaaaaannnnnd,   He has been black-listed by Ferrari.
Just beyond ridiculous now! Dude is desperate for views and is trying to hard to look cool by destroying expensive things. All so he can say “I don’t care about material things!” We get it, you like destroying things to get people all pissy!  I guess acting stupid never gets old! 🤡
heheheheheheheheeheheheheheheheheheheheheheeheheheheheheheheee
I was working and saw the notification. Made my night and finished strong. Now it's dinner and awesome content time ☺️
That should of been an ad for that bubble protector.
you should see what happens if a house falls on your ferrari with the bubble cover on it🧐
I hope you don't get Banned from Ferrari..lol
The lambo cover was honestly the icing for me.
Crazy to think that you could be in a room full of different style weapons and firearms and Cody would still be the most dangerous thing in that room 😂 dude is a menace and I’m here for it 😂😂😂
Can’t wait for him to off road a pavement princess Jeep wrangler just to make another video like this
Jesus Christ... How could you do that to the Ferrari?        Does this hurt the ground?
I can’t handle it, what a spoiled prick.
Still like your shows
Can we get an 8hr loop of stuff being thrown at it? So satisfying to watch
I can’t wait till you get the Bugatti 😏
Spend some money on American

As an Italian who loves Ferrari I really wanna see how good Ferrari really is so for Whistlindiesel doing it for me makes it better because he knows what I want to see
Fucking cool 😎
Pressure washing looked similar to the high colonic I just had !  haha  CODY i think Ferrari WILL be contacting you as they most likely will have perform a durability commercial for them ... whats that you say.... oh this was it... copy that ! Keep ALL OF the haters hating ! I love it !
Hes gonna be the first guy to win a lawsuit against ferrari

I wish I could buy one now just for the gloves.
Beautiful mini cooper

Can't believe you don't see more of these on the trails. Obviously an off road monster. Jokes aside, it handles those hills way better than it has any business doing.
Tune - 720hp F8 With pops - prob gonna kill turbos 😂😂😂😂
He’s literally so real I love it! If this doesn’t show a testament to the build quality, then I don’t know what is. I wish to grow as big as him on YouTube one day 🙌👨‍🍳🤞🥲

How to make an advertisement without mentioning “a word from our sponsors” 😂 that bubble kicks ass
Thanks, I needed a good laugh!
Your new name while driving the Ferrari is Chad.
Comments have been infected with the stolen icon Fake giveaway scammers. Good times.
For once I actually want to see this shitbox ripped apart.  Do the lambo next.   I would love to know where the money comes from however. Is it all from u tube?
RIP Thick44

Your not going to get sued. It's free advertising for its durability.

Best car channel on YouTube 😂
Being waiting for this one for quite awhile
From going to a farm in Indiana to owning a semi medium sized warehouse in Tennessee, and owning a Ferrari. We’re proud
Next I wanna see you do this to a hellcat , I know you did buggy wheels but you gotta step it up . Start buying up all the collectibles @whistlindiesal
It's so hard to watch a car that I can only dream of get destroyed. I would sleep in this car .
The car bubble ppl are living you right now that’s for sure lol
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO its too short!!!!!!! I have never liked and favorited a video so fast. I cannot STAND this company and this video is well deserved. I hope you go alll the way with its total destruction. I was surprised at its offroad performance. I guess being very light and high horsepower helps alot. Thank you thank you thank! for this video. This company needs to be brought to light and people need to boycott buying their products until they clean up their act or go bankrupt. Their choice.
Forza players be like:
YESSS
Whistlin diésel is stradmans lost evil twin brother I can’t wait for their colab 😂
Wheres the part where you 'Destroy ' it?
That’s a real Men Toy right there!
FAZE RUG       I Hosted a 1v1 Basketball Tournament for $10,000!
Best ad for a car cover ever!
Watching him go up the driveway is like watching Forza horizon
Anyone else's jaw remained dropped for the entire video?
when they all starting throwing random shit at the car it reminded me of HowToBasic
He should be in a real race, how good he drives.
The C8 comment is so funny!
Wow!!
I bet the guy or dealer who sold it to you just got black listed from Ferrari out of spite, so respect to them for going through with the deal
I can sleep tonite knowing that gorgeous car didn't get destroyed . I always don't give ashit but it's an impressive car and it's sexy.
That bubble held up surprisingly well 😂
He can do whatever he wants to it, what are they gonna do? sue him? lol
I know blarg is watching this, where you at boy?
you just sold more bubbles then the Co. ever has!
Just waiting for the law suit you’re about to get🥱
Next video Ferrari x excavator 🤣🤣🤣
Hell yeah
The ranger videos got be the funniest honestly hands down
Ok, love WD, but this kinda makes me sick lol!
The sheer amount of stuff thrown at the end, and how long it went made it 10x funnier than it needed to be 😂😂😂
hes playing Dirt 5 with a  real ferarri
The spy balloon joke broke me. 😂😂😂😂😂
thing sounds so good
"$120000, clean title, no damage, treated well. I know what I have." 😂
Enzo ferrari is rolling in his grave right now and i love it.

Looks like a Pontiac Fierorrari
Throwing everything at the Ferrari was awesome I was patiently waiting for a kitchen sink to go flying
Well this is going to be a interesting set of upcomeing videos
Awesome
"lets try something else give me a hammer" throws all of home depo at the car🤣🤣🤣🤣
I want that helmet super bad... can I have it please? I’ll cherish it! Been wanting one but can’t afford it. Holler if you wanna sell or are willing to give it away haha

So good!
11/10
Love the videos man! Instead of destroying a Ferrari u should take the money and invest it in a random crypto. Literally.
@WhistlinDiesel you should buy a Nascar Next! I know you got the General Lee but you need to get a Nascar! I got the idea when watching the Daytona then I saw this video!
This is exactly how I play GTA. weird costume, get a nice car, destroy it off roads.
whistlindiesel is the equivalent to a 14 year old with the net worth of elon musk
pin if you like tonks
Next episode, Lawyers Durability Test..
Cody is just getting it out of his system before he does 25 to life for 1st degree splashing.
he's driving this ferrari like its forza horizon 🤣
Terrible put strategies is the first thing that comes to mind when you said Ferrari
keep up the great content!
Cody, your videos don't come out fast enough! Been waiting bro
You threw everything at it accept for a kitchen sink, I'm disappointed man you should have done it right 😬😁👉🏽👍🏽
Ferrari 100% already had a protocol in place for when Cody got one😂 Cody red Cody red!!
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣💀☠️💀☠️💀☠️💀☠️ I can't breathe 😭 🤣
I dunno why, but i really wanna see this ferrari get destroyed, and i mean absolutely wrecked, get cut in half, chewed up and pit out into a lava lake

How many people are going to buy the bubble now
I was sober, and that was still funny as hell.
Please someone save this video incase he actually gets sued and has to delete it
That's how you spend money!
Damn it Cody !!     I said that 5-8 times during this video.  Laughing my but off. I hate the wait on your videos but dang it’s worth the wait!    Thanks man 🤘🏼
He Uses a Lamborghini cover for the Ferrari😂
You sir are a genius
Easily the most entertaining video I’ve ever seen
Dude is playing Forza irl 😂😂😂
Lift it put it on some mud tires
Can i take my camaro on your race track of a driveway?
Lawsuit settlement money + Cost of buying and tuning the Ferrari < Revenue generated by the video(s) = Profit (and awesome content)
The hillclimb was impressive
Stradman is having a heart attack
This video is funny af but hurt me watching a Ferrari do that
Amazing as always! Cody I WANT A BUBBLE LIKE THAT! Where is it from? Can you say? We get hail and if this can withstand ladders I think it’ll work lol
This man does not miss!!
I miss the truck vids 😤😂
Someone make sure Adam Carolla sees this.
this dude is so good at driving
I feel like this guy needs to be the official quality control person for cars.  “If it’s good enough for Cody it’s good enough for me”, and have a picture of him giving a thumbs up 😜
What if Guido and Antonio show up at the gate
I’m somehow sensing “Ferrari jars” by the end of the year

Forza Horizon in real life🤣
This was FUNNY!!  😆 Ultimate 🖕 to Ferrari and they're BS
Lmao 🤣
The very first Ferrari owner without herpes and douche-itis!!! Congrats! 😅
He’s actually somehow getting funnier every video somehow
Dude is so cringe now.
What's in the crates
I can only imagine what his midlife crisis is going to be like haha
Yes 🎉So good 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻👍👍👍That's what Ferrari does!
This is like Jackass for cars and trucks.
idc what you do to stuff anymore just enjoyable af to watch cant wait for tank vid part 2 ong (damn that thing sounds amazing)
I'm ready to invest in that car Bubble company
Lucky bastard playing gta in real life
I'm waiting for the CAT 330 to squish this into a small chunk of expensive metal......
This made me cringe lol. Owning a Ferrari has been a dream of mine since I was a kid. My grandma would take me grocery shopping with her and I'd sneak off and go to the magazine section and look at all the car magazines. Mid 90s.
This is what we’re here for
This dude is seriously the best lmao
Shit them car covers tho 🤣🤣
that was legit!
I JUST CAME TO THUMBS DOWN THE VIDEO & NOT EVEN WATCH IT.
Hell yeah I've been waiting for this 😈🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can I have the exhaust to put on a 2002 Toyota Tundra with shitty paint?
I’ll give you 1000$ for the car 😂
The real question is what’s the towing capacity on the Ferrari ? 😂
Needs Reaper wheels
Definitely looking forward to episode 2 of this adventure. 👌
What
Somewhere a trust fund baby is crying watching this
U are amazing, keep doing your thing
Wait til you get married, you'll waste more money than that...
that was the best commercial for the car bubble ive ever seen
Kinda reminds me of how I play forza horizon! I love it.
Noooo not a red Ferrari 🥲 lol
😂😂
thic-fil-a really be leaning into that gravy seals trope no?
here before ferrari sewed!!  You're awesome Cody
Great video!  I was laughing at all the stuff being thrown at the bubble around the car!
Mans does more off roading in his Rari than a lifter truck
End of the video just a add fir the bubble company 🤣
Just send me 100K mom and me will be happy with that
Pay off my mortgage challenge!
been waiting for this video for so long, ferrari needs to be humbled
Doing like no one else! I love it 😂
This bout to rack up millions of views 😂🤣😂🤣
Put some off-road tires and jack it up
There should be more segments in the future with other cars where you throw everything at the car balloon.
It's an object, only difference from a clapped out Minivan is it costs more money. Kudos on making a point 👉.
The best motoring journo out there haha
Yo how many ladders you got cuh
10:04Cody was not lying when he said this is his best video ever
And juss like that… you won’t be able to buy one off the lot ever again
I watch to laugh, then sigh, as I recently rolled my jeep and need to go car shopping.
I really want to see real world durability like tons of drifting and drag racing and burnouts just to enjoy the car and then slowly build up to the inevitable end — I’d appreciate 5+ videos out of this
This man drives real life cars the same way i drive when I play forza 😂
Cody's hasn't disappeared me at all, keep the good work 👏
i wish i could do this
You got to love this man 😂😅
The least damage in a video to date... Almost bored.. XD lol
Is that Mr.Coupe Mike Zusin at 4:41  https://youtube.com/@mrcoupe
that field has better roads than my whole country.
Never disappointed, I am impressed with its hill climbing though
what happens if you run it over with a tank? will it squeel?
This is the best add for that car bubble ever
Please give the people who made that car protector bubble rights to use this as a commercial 😂
this is mr.beast but backwards.
Fukn luv it !
Starving children could’ve eaten this car. Now they will have to starve.
Ok I love when whistlindiesle beats the shit out of stuff but this one hurts
Enjoy yourself!
🌝 so Ferrari gon sue or wat !?
8:15 looks straight outta gta5 💀🤣
i want one of those bubbles hahaha
Epic.
We need to see another any level sema truck get tested again 😂
Congratulations 🎉 I like ur videos
When he destroyed the rare shoes I got a lil mad but I’m a huge car guy and this is literally making me super mad
I don't know why you're doing that and what's so fun about doing something that you're deliberately doing at a really high price. Fools are the ones who get the money, and there are those who can't find food to eat, you really🤡
Well, you threw everything at it but sadly you forgot the kitchen sink. That my friend would have been comedy gold
Yea buddy.
That was one heck of an ad for the Car Capsule!!
Mans must have unlimited money
That spec is insane tho
True DDE fashion
Nice!
Yesssssss
Fuk Ferrari 😂😂😂
Bros doing what we all did in GTA V but in real life. Never knew I needed this but I did 😂
Bro, you’ve got Enzo turning in his bolognaise sauce.
13:44 I'm dying laughing!
Ending is gold 💪😂😂😂😂
wtf
at 1:30 why there so many cars and a Bentley
Yezsir send it
i was looking for the kitchen sink to be thrown, seeing as you threw everything else at it.
The ending was pure comedy
The new forza looks good af damn
Comment
Back to the basics,  nice
Thanks whistling diesel because this is exactly what I would do to a Ferrari if I had one just have FUN with it that’s the whole point of having one
Hommie playing forza horizon in real life lol
Why am I sweating while watching this. This video is like a bomb how long can Cody hold it in before hulking out
Lmfao this is awesome
Ls swap it
While we struggle under biden to eat, Cody destroys a Ferrari worth more than we avg folks 15yr wages
If it's red it's dead
I think we need a durability test on the spy balloon
this whole video made my anxiety shoot up and I don't even have anxiety, Great video tho man keep up the great work they always funny
Why not? the government uses a $400,000  sidewinder missle to shoot down a Baloon.
congrats on the first (and last) ferrari lol
THAT CEASE LETTER IS ALREADY PRINTED UP….
POV: You play forza horizon with simulation damage
In all my years watching this kid he's never made me cringe up. Untill now. Hitting the gate actually hurt me.
Ferrari watching 😳😨
Yo whistlindiesel i will do whatever you want if you on a video if you buy me a nice sports car. I am from canada
Here before this video gets taken down for some bs reason 😂😂😂😂😂
Bro said give me a hammer and got the whole toolbox lmao. Love the videos, keep the haters tears flowing.
Diesel done lost his mind. 😂
this proves you do not need an over 100k rally car to have fun in harsh conditions, you can just have a 400k 2023 ferrari
Oh god, I haven't laughed that hard at a bubble,  ever.
Ngl this is the first video I've actually cringed a little for the car. But this is too good😂
I cant wait for the cease and desist letter to show up at ferrari for modifying a whistlindiesel.
🤣💀
Literally me in forza lol 😂 🤣
Expect that letter in the mail soon 😂😂😂
It held up actually pretty well, quite surprising. Talk about that weak ass suspension though it’s meant to handle tons of downforce but it didn’t seem to handle a person well. Anyways great content can’t wait to see what happens to it next, maybe a 150ft sand dune jump.
Well worth the wait. Thank you for your service 😂😂😂
I'll give you 25 bucks for it...
You don’t deserve to have that car at all Ferrari come grab this car seriously
200k views in 1hr is insanity. wtf
The fools at Ferrari are losing their minds. Lol
Let's throw things at the bubble. Cody: Hold my beer
Fucking 😎 and really funny 😂😂😂
TaxTheRich100 vol 2
this should be for marketing
NO! Please don’t. No Mas! 😅
I bet he won’t even go mudding with it
I’m just here to say I’m tired if these fucking Mr beast experian ads
This is the content I come here for. 😂
What the f**k did I just see! Hope ferrari is doing something...
Gta5 was right driving up hills in super cars  fuck me all you need is speed 🤣🤣
I love how this turned out for an advertisement for the bubble protection. If to put my car in a bubble,  I would get this with all the stuff it withstood.
Had to make sure I watched this before the C&D comes out on it 🤣🤣🤣
Damn...    that shit made me laugh...
Now i want a Ferrari for rally
I’m genuinely excited to see someone use a Ferrari
One of the best endings in a long time. Laughed my ass off for a minute straight, brought me to tears dude
Perfect as always
Wow that is an impressive machine. I would give almost anything to own one but I am also going to enjoy this one getting destroyed!
I dont know how well the car will hold up but that cover rocks 👍
Best. Video. Ever.
This video slaps!!
Mine climbs hills like that in GTA too, big DEal
Dude how many throwable things does he have in his shop💀
Love your videos bro keep doing the good work
I know that yellow later hit that quarter panel in the back when y'all were throwin that stuff definitely slapped back into it 😂😂
Sue these a holes 😂😂😂
Can’t wait to see someone rebuild this in a year
I would like to see this happen to a rolls Royce Lamborghini or Bugatti please
"Give me a Hammer "
I thought you were gonna destroy it? Man what a jip.
It is about to go down !!! Cody done lost his mind !!
The Bubble-Bash was the Bollox, you loon. Again I'd like to mention, If you really want to F^*K shit up with your Excavator or Dozer, give me a shout. lol. Awesome content
Street speed 717 jumps a c8 ..whistling Diesel hold my beer 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thank you for this finally somebody can make fun of the rich
C8 Corvette you need to trash it
Damn.....😮
Literally a fucking Legned
buy a cop car a new one
That bubble held up nice 😂
i smiled when i saw the title
He’s fucking nuts. $400,000 and doesn’t give 2 shits about it. I wish I had his money so I could wipe my ass with the little money I have.
Me on forza
I can definitely say I bet the people who made that bubble really loved this video😂
This vid was great. The mud that got caked up in the hole was hilarious. I bet that's the first time that's ever happened. That car bubble was surprisingly durable, and gut busting
The ending is the best👌😆🤣
Why the fuck were all those cases at the end ?!
My man's playing forza in real life and I'm here for it.
*nervous intensifies*  Excellent. I loved it.
Hilux is still the daddy
You need to give us a video at least once a week.
That car cost more than my parents first house.
A legal super team is currently being assembled
Ferrari Executives are fuming right now
I'm curious why you have like 75 Army Hardigg boxes in the background. 🤣
I’m impressed how well the Ferrari handles
I’m honestly shocked he didn’t throw the G-wagon at the bubble.
If you drive over it in your tank ultimate durability test
😆🤣😂😹
how i treat my super cars in gta
Are we going to just ignore how clean some of those driveway corner power slides were
Hate to say it…. The Ferrari did better then MONSTERMAX
I enjoyed this video almost took me back to the days when he said he’s going to keep everything nice
4:26 I KNEW THIS LINE WAS COMING lol.
Air boat ship or air tank All would bounce off it
It sounds so good tho lol
Because why not? This is going to be good. 👍 cody
Someone’s getting blacklisted.
Could you buy me a Ferrari?
13:16 Everything but the kitchen sink. Sadly, No kitchen sink :(
I would hot box that bubble bro.
👍😎👍
It's a masters class on trolling. Well done.
duramax swap it
It actually hurts to watch him destroy one of my favorite modern car, I love it.
I have questionable morals, can I help?
You get more stupid as time goes on.  Loving it
Oh hell no not this that car is too gorgeous
doug cameo
Well this video ended rather unexpectedly…
Smash that like button  yall come on lets get to that 10 million!!
Lol I bet all the other rebuild car youtubers are watching this and are already planning on bidding for it on coparts... sadly to say guys if it end up on coparts Nothing will be salvageable from this Ferrari once WD is done with it 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
W
If I was Ferrari I’d be impressed with what this thing sustained
Daily whistlin exotics
be a shame if all those crates fell on it
That's it Awwwww.....
😂😂😂 bro you crazy
this man playing the wirh the farrari gods
Forza horizon I'm real life.
THIS IS A FREAKING EPIC VIDEO
average forza player
Awesome video!!! 10/10 sir! Keep up the good work! Well work the wait🍻
dude has the funnest job.
Diesel swap
Just awesome!!!
Now it's worth $800,000
Who in their right mind would give him a loan to buy this? No way he paid cash lol
12:17 to 14:11, some of the best free marketing / advertising that company is ever going to get
Casually playing Forza Horizon IRL.
Loved it, hilarious, give me a hammer at the end had me laughing my ass off🤣  Keep up the good work Cody, can't wait to see the next installment of f8 Ferrari debauchery😉👍
Ferrari aside Cody is actually an insane driver, dude has so much control
The second half of this video is just me in forza horizon 4
Cody you honestly embody “fuck what everybody thinks of me”. Keep it up man love it 💪💪💪💪🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yes yes yes yes yes
Can’t wait for the Chiron durability test
All I can say is kudos to you my friend she did the wrong thing now that gives you more time to film
Quit buying Ferraris. We wanna see that Bugatti
I don't get why didn't throw the kitchen sink at it
Here we go 🎉
This whole video hurt me inside
Ferrari going sue you for destroying your own car lol.
Bro’s playing GTA IRL😂
That was a lot of shit thrown at that at the bubble reminds me of my life lol
I like Ferrari now, they should be paying you for promotion
what a fucking legend.
I laughed way to much at all the stuff being hurled at the Ferrari.
First time out of alll Whispers videos...i said Ohhhhhhhhhhhh
Finally! someone is using a ferrari the way it was meant to be driven!
Ferrari will love this 😂😂😂 can’t wait to see the next video 👌
Is that Ferrari boulder proof?
cooll
Whats the first word that comes to mind ? Overpriced and the second word is junk.
Silver lake sand dunes
And again I leave with a smile ...the end was epic. What a product
The skits are getting old man can you just show us the car and then break it or whatever you wanna do? I'm not sure its coming off quite as funny as intended like we get it you're a big goofy goofball who doesn't give a hoot.
What a masterpiece of a video Hahah. Sticking it to Ferrari 😂 what’s gonna be more entertaining will be how Ferraris legal teams reacts!!! 😂😂 keep the content coming!!! Subbed!
"They must've done that for when you're rock crawling"   I beg you, have someone build a lift kit for this thing and go rock crawl with it 😂😂😂
Does the bubble cover make the Ferrari amphibious?  It’s been a few episodes since you splashed someone.  Inquiring minds….
Pfffff. He didn't  launch it off any sweet jumps or even drive it through his garage door.
You know kinda reminds me of what dde has done in the past with super cars. Just taken it a little further. Lol. Still funny though.
This man has me dying every time he post.😂
This is gonna be fun and painful to watch lol
I need that bubble for my house just incase a nuke comes down on us
i feel like i should of paid getting to watch that ferrari put to the test. you never get to see this shit!!!! thanks
Best video from you in a long time
These videos were entertaining 2 years ago but now they are just dumb.  That being said if you continue to make money from posting dumb content you would be foolish to stop so this really says more about just how stupid the audience is than the person creating the content.
This is so me driving in forza horizon 5
It’s red 😮 it’ll die
He can actually drive well 😭
Thank God for the tow hook 🤣
Ferrari watching this
i would like the Ferrari, please
can you give it away to me when your done with it?
It's a part of life at this point for you if you want to go to Disney please for the love of God learn how to merge
If you sue me, ill sue you on the broken key before even driving it 😂
Hey I seen my comment on your ig post in there nice 😎
Real life forza
Me in forza
Definitely should be in a fast and furious movie
can someone tell me what all those expensive-looking cases are at the end?
Listen ladies and gentlemen it just goes to show you if you practice you will be perfect especially on driving.... Good God can we please talk about the Disney morons that don't know how to merge
You forgot to throw the kitchen sink. The kitchen sink would most certainly have breeched the bubble and totaled the car and resulted in frivolous litigation from Ferrari
I don't doubt for a second that in ten or so years we'll be seeing him beat the shit out of the Ferrari 250 GTO
these videos make me cringe in a good way
I love how he just pretends that the car cover is not for a Lamborghini lol.🤣
Needs an fmf fatty pipe
Total the car, put the engine in a Hilux
Well what you just did at the end was some free fucking advertisement for the bubble protector car thing
Now this is content
I would love just to hang out with you for a day just for the laughs and the destruction would make for a great day.
Can we have some of those plastic crates in the background after you destroy whatever is in them?
I'm sure farrtardy has already figured out which dealer sold you tha car.. has repo trucks otw to pickup the rest of their inventory and your lawyer is $h!tface drunk right about now 😂
10:29 10:31 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🥲🤣🤣
MY BOI ALEX IS PROUD 🥹
One Biden balloon popper missile costs $400k.  Juck Foe Biden
Absolutamente loco😂
bruh this kid smh Ferrari about to never let you buy another car from them ever
Product testing at its finest
Best Video Yet.
You forgot to throw the kitchen sink @ it!!🤔😎🏆
Put it in water 💧 lol 😂
Yes dude been waiting for this 😂😂
Hear me out .  Ferrarimax …..
Hi, uummm Cody is it...?   We're here from Ferrari, we own MonsterMaXX2 and the ass that drives it.
The fact t hat he's not even scared of getting sued is a manly thing to do😂
You do things that most of us would only dream of doing, but at least we get to watch someone do it😂
What a beautiful car
No way you can get sued. You gave the Ferrari the special treatment with that bubble 😂
"You buy a Ferrari when you want to be somebody. You buy a Lamborghini when you are somebody." -Frank Sinatra
‼️You might as well lift it a little and off road it with the g wagon it’d be a 1/1 and piss everyone off 😂
It's like in GTA 5, the 4wd trucks go like shit, the highest end cars have the best off road capability
I gotta lie, I'm really impressed!
That was fun!
This is by far the  most entertaining channel on Youtube.
I think a Koenigsegg durability test should be in the future... I was impressed with the sledgehammer stunt. Awesome work as always Cody. That thing did seriously impress me climbing the hill
You made history with this one
Im so happy my youtube algorithm is helping fund crap like this. Ferraris legal team will have a field day with this and we love it.
Who else is glad he made an old-styled WD video? I missed these so much 😂😂
The end 💀
That was the best commercial for a car bubble I’ve seen!
I’m a car guy to heart, and I know you are too, but funny enough we both enjoy watching nice stuff be destroyed 😂
I enjoy watching ur video
Forza horizon irl
Sweet
BASED.
I was about to mod a Ferrari on GTA but I might get sued for sue.
Lmfao the Lamborghini cover 🤣🤣
The bubble company can use this for a commercial fr
Yessss the time has come and it’s redddd
Looking forward to much more Farreri content!!!
“Give me a hammer”…..HILARIOUS!!!
WHY JUST WHY!!!!!!
that air  bubble just got the best friggin ad for free
i'm 62...... now that shit is funny
Man I hate how this guy destroys cars when you know they wont be in production forever. Sure, driving with it sensibly and even racing it is fine because its built for that. But absolutely destroying a car and making it do what it was not built for is just pain to watch. Plz leave us young enthusiasts some cars to drive when we get older. Even the Gtr r32, plz maintain cars like that and keep them going for as long as possible.
Ferrari doesn’t care about a used Ferrari.. Ferrari can afford a new Ferrari.. you doing Ferrari a favoury
Best video ever hands down!
i am so excited for this series! i think your calling is destroying hypercars, please do this forever
13:18 pov: a cartoon character is looking for something in his backpack
Definitely would like to go all crazy with a Ferrari as my bucket list 🥹🥲
Great job. 🎈
Goodamn that sounds sick.   Atleast that bubble cover held up!
11:43 "This is a huge bubble that goes around the car to protect it from stuff like helicopter crashes"... 🚁😏
This man just created Forza Horizon in real life
Ferrari is 🗑 stuck up euro$cum
I gotta feeling the airbags might eventually blow after a few more tests 😂 if you need help getting the car running after they blow we can bypass that 😅✌️ waiting for Part 2 …
That yellow gas can did a satisfying plop😂 (14:03)
ive been watching for almost 3 years but this is to far
After watching this I just have 1 question. How many people were there throwing things at the end haha
At this point I’m glad I don’t work for Ferrari
It’s like watching a car crash in slow motion. You want to look away but you can’t.. 😢😢😢
The Lamborghini cover was an underrated troll
Please open a place in Niagara Falls
Watching it climb that hill made me think.  If you REALLY want to piss Ferrari off, put an enormous frigging wing kit on it and enter it in the Pike's Peak climb.
Love it keep up the good work on the videos lad
😂😂😂😂😂👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
How durable are the painted brake calipers. Like if the rotors were glowing red from racing would the paint last?
I’m impressed how it handled the hills and Cody I’m not gonna lie your a Amazing drifter
The company that makes that bubble test should pay you millions
Bro literally driving like in Forza 😂
Finally Ive been waiting on this one
It’s not like he just breaks stuff… it’s top notch content. Keep it up
That bubble is actually hella impressive 😂😂😂😂 how did a hammer or screwdriver not pop that thing
Yup. If won the lotto ferrari gocart dirt track 💯
Some GTA shit with the Ferrari on Mount Chiliad
THIS JUS MADE MY DAY!
Take that StreetSpeed 717!
💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💨💨💨💨💨💨💨💨💨🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁
i m glad you destroy a ferrari, we , this generation, prefer lambo
Hahaha haha! Fuc$in Bravo brother. Amazing
i usually put my dog in the little spot in the hood. they love feeling the wind and its keeps their hair out of the interior.
Was kinda expecting a kitchen sink at the end
YouTube GOD
Where's the kitchen sink? 🤣
Someone, somewhere at Ferrari cannot run quickly enough to a local court house.
Can you do this, but with electric cars please? Like teslas or some shit
It's really fun to watch but it hurts to watch this😭😭
This totally needs a lift kit and monster truck wheels.
this is a great content LOL
Excellent video but I miss a good old Cateye video
That thing sounds crazy climbing up the hill!
Notice the Porsche collection on the car racks .... Not to mention the large amount of military cases an various other things ... Our boy is going next level ..again.
can we take in how good of a driver Cody is he rips that car around no problem. Well anything he drives really
Very impressed  Whistle Diesel you can fucking drive bro going up that hill is very impressive I love watching your videos , can I be your righthand man please
Thats my boy with the Enzo gently placing the ladder!!  Atif (find him here) @TunerWorld
Dibs on Ferrari mulch!
https://youtube.com/shorts/gX2XU5z5uHc?feature=share
You're going to get sued by foogets
daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn
Man give me that car....thats too nice...I'll trade you a 1000hp  900 mile mustang mach 1 to destroy..
Me in forza horizon:
That bubble at the end has to be the only thing that’s whistlingdiesel proof😂😂
But you were supposed to be saving for a Bugatti!!!
:30 into the video and I hit the like button. Why? I don't know what's going to happen, but Cody is already banned from buying a new Ferrari for life at this mark in the film.
YES this is what I wanna see
This makes me so happy to watch!! I have been smiling from the start of the video.
Best damn sense of humor, this shit makes me so happy. I'll remain poor so this you can keep this shit going lmao
dude gonna get a cease and desist letter before he can do damage
When I saw the crutches hit the bubble that did it for me
you have lost your touch. im so ashamed of you son.
This was hard to watch but funny and just glad he didn't really do any major damage...yet.🙈
SHEEEEESH THT THING IS INDESTRUCTIBLE BUT THROW A DART OR SOMETHING POINTY LOL.. YOU ARE NUTZ...
Tesla needs the same fate…I mean “durability” test
https://youtube.com/shorts/P0l2QFCAKoA?feature=share
best yt videos on this earth
*WhistlinDiesel has never heard of clickbait...*
F*ck the haters, I smiled and laughed this whole video. Keep up the good work!! Can’t wait to get Ferrari mulch!!
Next merch drop when? :D
Tax the rich part 2
First time I see a off-road Ferrari
thats a good car protector lol
Watching this early before it gets taken down by Ferrari 😂😂
Forza?
I remember a time when he said he’ll never durability test a car on his channel 😂😂
Had to like when he “modified” the logo. Hate to see the cars get destroyed but he’s certainly found an audience for his shenanigans 😀
i can hear the lawsuits coming 💀
Been watching yr's now crazy how far this has came... Ur great man...
Ferrari seize and desist coming in in 3....2....
I was gonna say deadmau5 is what I think of when I hear Ferrari lmao
I was so tensed up when I thought that little unknown brand Italian car was going to hit that fine fine automobile of a hilux. I mean hell it could have chipped that factory Toyota paint with the gravel, it was extremely nerve-wracking.  Keep up the great work brother much love and respect.
That was the BEST advertisement that bubble company could ask for! Lol guaranteed their sales just went up!
I'm very disappointed you didn't include the kitchen sink at the end....... 😂
That car is awesome.
https://youtu.be/WntjAM2wqF8
He’s living real life Forza Horizon 😅
I'm 3 minutes in and I'm already rolling     Another joint
I still want to see you lift this thing and make it a true off road monster. Give us the Safari Ferrari!
Like need for speed in real life. If Ferrari sues... Whatever... He is showing what their cars capabilities are.
The best property car ever
Congratulations brother!!!!! Love the car and the content..great job homie..I have 7 Acers and big pound if you ever want a different place to film...step mountain to climb too
The end part 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣 literally crying with laughter!
Cars sounds great.
The first thing I think of when I hear fartrarri is damn it’s nice but it ain’t a nismo or a 6 oh
Maaaaaadddd respect to whistlin diesel.
So you bought a $400,000 Ferrari just to destroy it that a boy🙂
HAHAH! Keep up that car testing that all others are afraid to do!
With the yellow headlights on a $400k car, it deserves to be destroyed
call yourself a journalist and hide behind the first amendment rights
Whistlin diesel needs to be a gta character or make his own video game
Where is the Koenigsegg
without a hat on you look like the guy from kreosan (a youtube channel)
I would have died to see everything thrown at including the kitchen sink!! Awesome!
Sounds Like Fun To Me 🇺🇸 WhistlinDiesel Is The BEST.
5:49     I dont care what any hater says, seeing cars like this in shots like this is absolutely fantastic. It feels like something out of Forza in real life
Probably the best video yet!! 👍
cody always be coming through with the best fucking videos on youtube!
I am cringing but I love it as a Ferrari fan boy
Bro’s Forza Horizon irl
Ok so while I don’t give a crap about stuff and possessions or fancy super expensive cars watching something brand new in perfect shape getting destroyed still hurt a little. Respect on the full sending as usual.
are those yours  cars behind u
Can I have the Ferrari 🙏
I cried and I laughed and I laughed and I laughed and I laughed and I laughed and I laughed and I laughed and I laughed and I laughed and I laughed and I laughed...primo!
remembering on top gear how much paint was gone after driving a 458 on a dusty airstrip and remembering what the enzos and f50s used to look like at the end of a gumball back when the gumball was still a wild event. this car is gonna have no paint in 2 weeks lmao
If you ever do you get a cease-and-desist letter, you should hide the car on the property, paint it in camo and  then have them go look for it  👀 👀👀👀👀👀
Bros boutta cop another ferrari to put  around in
Goddamn. That balloon is impressive asf. Some aggressive tires on the Ferrari and it would be a legit hill climb monster.
OMG, 13 minutes in I laughed so hard it made me feel old (couldn't catch my breath)
This guy is just great  Break more things I love please
It’s like watching Magnum WD
Considering they don't have a legal contract with you...I don't think Ferrari will do anything. Just saying. They have no rights to this car now.... 3rd party purchase.
Love that you’ve shut down the haters and to all those who said he wouldn’t trash this.
Ngl this one hurts. It’s such a beautiful car.
Are those all gun crates ?😐
Bros living out my dreams
Coolest video in the world you are my favorite YouTuber have an amazing day❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ you should watch the movie Ford versus Ferrari❤❤❤
Yk Ferrari is coming with that sue notice
I mean I guess I should say thank you Ferrari gay rainbow picture and I know who's that is but the bottom picture in that post is a GTR it's not a Ferrari
It does whistle too
U are crazy 😂
Here we go baby!!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
You would be dangerous if you could actually drive a car!!! You’re just along for the ride. I guess that’s what you do when you have no talent and endless money. Must be nice
I just love how Doug demuros thisssssss is in here 🤣
I enjoyed every minute of this video. Can’t wait for Ferrari response
Sweet Camaro!
Sales for car bubble going out the roof 😂
The tool sounds at the end kinda reminds me of a Pink Floyd song called Time with the clanging and stuff it’s reminiscent of it at least
Forza Horizon IRL
My guy is playing forza
please dont completely obliterate the car
Wow that’s a Cool Fast Sports Car
Getting sued by ferrari (speedrun)
Holy Shit!!! ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE 🇺🇸 Keep doing ya thing Cod Sack

This is what streetspeed thought he was doing with the c8 lol
Quality content as always. Can’t wait to here what Ferrari says. He’s standing up to Italian corporate power!
Watching your tank get ready over the last few months, going to be sad  if you scratch it...... You should get it detailed when it arrives :)
Awesome vid. Just shitting on Ferrari the whole time lol
wrench fight 2 but we use our F***ari bubble as cover (had to censor name so i don’t get epsteined)
The last part was easily the funniest, nonetheless that thing sounds awesome! Excited for the content on the Ferrari
How about an “ultimate sinkhole” test..?
Hey WD, all truck day, Piedmont Dragway 3/4/23.
The ending is GOLD!
chevy cobalt durablity test next(:
Cock and ball

Congrats and RIP on your first Ferrari!
Where can i get that bubble 😂😂
Bro driving that like a bored guy in Forza that’s scary do it again
Use a skid loader to pull out the engine and install it on a hilux
If u own the car idk if u can rly get sued
How I drive on forza horizon 😅
He threw everything but the kitchen sink at it
first good sounding f8
I love you man but…please after your done torturing it please fix it up and make her beautiful again please
You drive this car like you’re playing free roam on gta 5
This thing will have more owners than any other Ferrari when he’s done with it… this thing will fill up at least 5000 jars once it’s shredded lol 😅🤣 and he’ll sell it for more than he paid! This dudes a genius!
Forza 5 irl
me the entire time: oh no... I can't watch this! it hurts! stop!
13:18 Random shit go!
here before ferrari forcefully takes this down
7:36 dude is playing FH4 irl
WD, answering your unanswered questions so you don’t have to ask
Just missing the kitchen sink there at the end.
Oh I can't wait for the next video lol
Funny that there’s an AD for people with limited resources on the top of recommended videos.
Amazing I Fucking love it... Now I wanna see a dukes of Hazzard paint scheme and this car in the air next video... Dare in place... 😆
Your nuts. It did go alot better than I figured it would. When ya total it I call first dibs on the catalytic converters off it. Lol
Never been a Ferrari guy 😂
I would be proud of you if made a video about the non profit fund you donate to. Or the one where you created a fundraiser for all the dying children in cancer centers who do not have the opportunities you will have. Not hating whatsoever but some true substance would be a sight to see. 🤙
Almost peed myself all the stuff being thrown all at once 😂
13:36 they actually have air tents for bomb areas so everything and everyone safe in them I made small ones and they took it and made huge ones like wearhouse size
Bro is anyone gonna talk about how good of a driver you have to be not to send that thing off a cliff doing the things he's doing???
bro is just playing forza irl😂
Eat your heart out Top Gear
Alright, first time ever commenting. You got me laughing at the Demuro “this!” 😅
The SERIES WE ALL DREAMED OF! So happy lol this is the LEVEL THE BAR THE SKY THE COMING FOR MR BEAST!
Take it to a ferrari dealship and have them diagnose the dmg LOL
I literally just started watching this video and Ferrari already me a cease and desist letter
Best ending ever
❤
the angle grinder beside the gas can had me rolling
Just the ending with everything being thrown at the bobble did nothing
The Lamborghini car cover was a beautiful touch.  Chef's kiss.
Man’s is literally playing Forza Horizon in real life! 🔥🔥🫡
I remember watch Cody when he first started off. Loved his content then and love it now. Everyone is just upset that they can’t do what he does, and not care about material things.
I knew it would eventually come to this. Good bye dude.
This guy is next level and I love it!
That car sounds amazing. Glorious even
Hurricane proof
Need to see a behind the camera when you were throwing all that stuff
I fucking love this channel
I think you just unintentionally made a sales video for the bubble brand
Cody's content just gets better and better.
I’m quite impressed with it actually.
Cody you will go down as a YouTube legend ! Keep up the great content !
I kind of want a bubble now
This guy gets to do what I do in Forza in real life 😂
FUNNY SHIT.
My man is living forza in real life ..much respect 🤙🏼💯
I’m waiting for the cease and desist
I’m sick gOd
MF playing Forza Horizon in real life
You know how someone bought the Hellcat? Don’t let them do it to this…
Fck yeah Boi
This is funny ferrari if you see this video he's testing if it's good are not
Ferrari mulch when
i have to take a deep breath before i click on one of your videos
The car rebuilders on yt rn drooling watching this video waiting for the f8 to be at  the copart auction lol #goondsquad #samcrac #tavarish 🤣🤣🤣
Put some paddle tires on that thing
That last scene felt like a fever dream and i dunno why
All here for the c8 slander, definitely the most impressive but ugly vette to date
Been waiting for this one 🤣
I would rather own a 1930s hot rod than this car
Insane.
The bubble guard scene was absolutely hilarious.
ROAD TO BUGATTI STARTS WITH A RARRI! But fr, Cody does not give a fuck
Wtf are those cases in the background. They look like military style gun transport boxes?
What are you in the 2nd grade dude>
This is fr some forza horizon shit
Love the ending. Or is it just the beginning..
Spending half your life dreaming about owning a supercar, a second later you see some random guy thrashing one!
Did he just foreshadow a Koenigsegg reliability test?
Ferrari is going to love this video 😂
Finally. Since 90's, it's my dream to see some richie screwing Ferrari
13:17 is the perfect ad for that car storage bubble lol. The amount of stuff thrown at it at once is hilarious.
What are all those military cases in the garage?
Truly one ups himself time and time again. The greatest video so far
You never disappoint 😭
This is very reminiscent of the TAXTHERICH guy that drifted Maserati's and other shenanigans.
Red it's dead
This shit was funny af😂😂😂😂
God i love this channel
Real life gta
I just wonder if this thing can take a fox.
I’ll trade you my RS5 when you’re done with it
I kinda want that bubble now
If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ferrari
9:40 best part
gotta put haters tears on it
Please go to a rally racing event and participate with this
so good sounding
mans literally playing forza horizons
I haven't been entertained for so long since the last time I was breast fed...66 years ago....well done young man, both you and your crew....
I am trying to contact you about your car insurance
Ferrari watching this😦
Ferary plis dont black list this good guy 😁
This is going to be a classic Whistlin Diesel video for the future.
You honestly need to buy a real rally car or have one built for you and rip around there
I haven't laughed so hard in a long time🤣 Ferrari fanboys and girls are foaming at the mouth right now. Bless you sir🙏🤣
This man took the hot lap route up Mt Chiliad
This is the video I've been waiting for. Him actually destroying an expensive vehicle.
This my outfit! "Thicc-fil-A" 🤣🤣🤣
Wow
That’s legit the sickest sight to see 🤘🔥
So funny! I just want to keep watching!
😂
7:03 that made me jump lmao
This is just a commercial for the world's strongest car bubble.
When You go too sell it Let this man Know LOL  You make me fucking laugh Every video such amazing content If ITs anything like The Ford truck IM in
Honestly whatever company made that bubble should be paying you. That was a solid test of that thing.
Well whoever made the car bubble. Can now feature a WD durability test video aside their Hail storm video lol
I noticed half way through the video that my hands were actually sweating...
imagine the amount of starving kids in Africa that could have eaten that car
Hey I really recommend you get a FPV drone to get some sick shots
This video gave me anxiety. 😅
I hate him so much 😭😭😭
You must have got a hell of a tax return to pick that up.
the first thing that comes to my mind when you say Ferrari is whistlindiesel cause man where my favorite white boy been at man finally a video from Dustin lynch jr man it’s been a year and a new born baby please stay consistent I miss my boo lol
Dudes a sneaky stig he was whipping that Ferrari around
I'm pretty sure this will break the internet💥
Love to see it
Yes
Ferrari must not know who this man is.. how did he get them to approve a purchase??
Only thing missing was a sink hurrled at the Ferrari.
Off road tires and in the dunes, but put a lift kit on it
This guy just don't stop 😂🤦🤦
Cody you are a fucking legend you should put big of road wheels on it lol then see what ferrari say 🤣
doing drivers ed while watching this was definitely an experience I will never forget 😂
That bubble is amazing 😂 won’t last long though
Don’t die
Ferrari Executive’s talking to their lawyers right now 😂
🇺🇸😂😂😂😂
lets just take a moment to appreciate how good wistlindiesel is good at driving.
CLAIM YOUR HERE BEFORE 10 MILLION VIEWS TICKETS 🎫🎫🎫
How much money do you have? This is impressive
Just wait for Ferrari to sue you for 10x the car.
Well.. You could have Mr. Beast it and gave it away :)
this is what Ferraris were built for
Wheres this man's Lamborghini sponsorship? Some company needs to give Cody cars to torture test!! Crazy commercials!!!
Here I am 1 hour latter waiting for a post of a cease and desist letter from Ferrari
Dude… Ferrari gonna start ww3
Would’ve been pretty funny if the last thing to be thrown was a big black d!ldo at the end.
I haven't laughed this hard in years.  Thanks Cody.
Dude these new forza graphics are sick 🤣 what festival he headed to?
The bubble house better sponsor you
CLAIM YOUR HERE BEFORE 1 MILLION VIEWS TICKETS 🎫🎫🎫
I wanna know how many people were stood there to throw all that stuff at the end!!
Would love to see a 720s durability test
Honestly Ferrari would be dumb to sue, this is one of the biggest advertisement they could get and it’s free
yes fucking thrash it   WD!!!!!!!!
Best vid in a while hahahahahahaaaa. Dude you just sold SO MANY car covers
Dudes first on the planet to do so many things haha awesome. Shit means nothing.
End was so funny
The bubble was cool!
You know things in life have been tough the last couple years but I'll Say Whole Heartedly, NOTHING beats a good Whistlin vid about 4 beers deep to crack up at the whole time on a Sunday, Here's to you Real Men of Genius, Cheers! Thankyou!
I've watched this guy since the beginning, and this is my favorite video to date!
This is literally forza horizon when you cut through the fields😭😭
Not gonna lie. That last part was hilarious 🤣
I fucking love it
This was a mf thrill ride and a half holy shit
Whistlin diesel is like when you beat Trevor on story mode and is just bored going around the map 😂
Click bait... what happened to not click batting us huh? I didn't see no Ferrari getting destroyed 😤
That bubble held up a lot more than I thought it would
whats next
This is the most proud ive ever been! I hope ferrari cries watching this video😂
I feel like I’m 2-3 years Cody will be doing a Koenigsegg durability test after the Bugatti 😂 this video was awesome this was hilarious the number of things thrown at the car was insane and honestly it did pretty well throughout the video with the off roading and everything. Cody is a legend nobody has the balls to do what he did in this video and I’m pretty in a few hours he will actually get a letter from Ferrari it was all jokes but now it’s real 💀
Bruh this dude 😭
More footage!!!!!!
Real life GTA Your sick man love it HAHAHA
forza irl
This is how I drive my Ferrari in forza your doing it in real life 😂
Incoming Ferrari Legal Team
I love how much fun Cody has in all of his videos. As an added bonus he's probably pissing off a lot of irarreF executives
Omg that was one of your best videos! I thought I was going to piss my pants! Keep up the great content
They just emptied the whole Gmod inventory
13:18 LOL
I wonder if that bubble is tank proof?🤔
Yeah Ferrari is blacklisting him by midnight 😂💯
Sick driveway, even sicker in the rain!
Any idiot can destroy something, it takes a man to build something! Donald j Trump
Watching this after watching a DDE upload...not sure if my brain can handle it
Remember folks, WD has a tank on route....
Hand built     Hand distorde
I was just laughing my ass off and bam videos over lmaoo I'm mad.
Have Ed Bolian help you get an Avalon King detail and go again.
Looks like a corvette 😅
Lamborghini car cover on a Ferrari. Straight to jail.  Destroying a Ferrari Straight to jail.
impreza sti stress test
100% Ferrari is writing a cease and desist order immediately and I hope you tell them to go f*ck themselves. This is actually exciting…about time their legal team met their match.
bro was playing forza horizon irl\\
Best person ever to do this 😆waiting for Ferrari's response
At least he’s not curing blindness.
You literally threw EVERYTHING at it! 😂
This looks like real life forza horizon 😂 love it❤️
Damn that´s awesome content once again! Love it
It's raining objects 🤣
You just made the best commercial ever for that bubble
Wow oh WOW.         STANDING O......
Definitely the ugliest car on the channel so far
Hell yeah let's get it
Looking a little Garand in that outfit.....  Now I kno where all the plastic cases went......
I loved every second of this video
Some day when these Tubers are broke and unemployed they’ll look back on the money wasted with heavy hearts. Just ask Bam.
How is there so much to throw lmao
This is gonna be a funny chain of videos
Wooooow
The subtle Chinese spy balloon pun was epic
Dude, the quality of these videos are the best 👌
the longest dizz ever made
Mr.Lamborghini laughing in his grave right now
Slightly used , babied, like new
Ferrari watching this 😡
dude is playing gta in real life
OK ! that car cover was amazing LMAO
I'd totally do that too wooooo  awesome vid ! An I know about u on the hyway pushing that tree! SICK
Don't put a video out for months... Then come out with this s***ty 14 minute video? What a f***ing GENIUS MOVE! Lmfao! This was fire
Alright i just wanna watch u offroading the ferrari all day now lol
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 well done sir. Well done
Boggers comming soon?
ich sterb gleich vor heulen
Next: LA mansion durability test
Disney sent a guy off PFI youtube channel a" cease an desist " letter cuz he named his black drag car the "Grinch" it had green highlights.  Found that to be crazy as well.
BROTHER,, I'm 3 min into the video and already laughing my ass off!  THIS,,, is going to be a great one!!!
6:56 he almost dented that hilux
Give the money to homeless people dude..or poor Mexicans. Instead of burning it!
Ferrari seems to not really care what you do as long as you dont diminish their trademarks or modify their logos, you can logo delete them and all and they dont care, or if you destroy their halo cars in a way thats not racing/driving normally they get mad.....theres plenty of guys that have had no issues LS swapping old 355/360s and even k swapping older ones.
Cody, when/if you get sued, you need to frame the paper from Ferrari 😂
I'm a car guy, most of his other destruction videos hurt a little but this one is well deserved. Fuck Ferrari and fuck their loyal drivers. Worst car company in history.
Lmao I love you brother! Vids are always funny as hell!
Doing things that 99.9% of us would only do in Forza lol
the hammer bit is hilarious
I stole your dad's skid loader just to destroy it.
"The worst part about this video is that it has an ending." 😂
Queue Waylon: 🎶🎼 “Just a good ole boys…”🎼🎶
This is why i love this channel! 😂😂
🇺🇸🔥
Wow!😂
The sharpie on the emblem was hilarious 🤣
Beats the hell out of streetspeed717 s C8 video .lmao
He’s really playing forza irl
He basically just made a free add for the Ferrari bubble
This is like a Alex Choi type video now but better haha
I still want a pair of those first shoes you tested. I went through 3-4 pairs of boots every deployment and those  things really held up!
Looks like a good chock block for monster max
Not only did you do donuts in a Ferrari but you did so on the dirtiest offroads ever 😂 The bubble house test was insanely impressive, that's seriously a good ad if I've ever seen one for bubble wrap!
Literally the best creator on YT
It’s a shame that Ferrari will make you take down this video shortly.
Didn't even throw 1 duramax tie rod at it. Who have you become 😪
Take it the top rope lol
Don’t destroy it brooo
13:07- yeah that's what she said. No Bitches
😂😂😂😂made my day!
From clapped out duramax's to the finest Ferrari ❤️ love it bro
Turned on all post notifications, still didn't get a notification you posted.
Cease
So if I buy a Ferrari in the very very very far future, and it does NOT do that well off-road, I’m suing both you and Ferrari.  😂
Finally a great Ferrari video on internet
You made them sweat Cody 😂
This stuff is cool I do enjoy it but he could use some of that cash to help under privileged kids go to school to break the cycle of failure in there homes.  One thing I can say mrbeast fucks up alot of cash but it's balanced between helping others and his videos. One day Cody will mature and see what I mean but until then tear that shit up man. Poor kids got alot of anger built up towards someone lol. Lemme know if you need a stuntman/ crash test dummie lmao.
ForZa shitttt
Just waiting for the jars of Ferrari mulch 😂
Me in Forza Horizon 4
I gotta get me one of them car covers 🤣🤣🤣
This video is one of the best. Comedy was perfect lmao
It's insane how many lawsuits happen for BS reasons.
When you are a kid this is how you imagine driving with hot wheels.  This guy does it in real life.
siiii!!! que brutal!! me encana teste WhistlinDiesel yo quiero 2 parte!!!
Love it bro congrats! I feel like you treat your vehicles no different than the Saudis and Arabian countries do.  👨
this guy used to be funny but now he doing to much broken record you gone crash hard
DDE was looking for a platform for cheap after your done with it if the title and frame are still good lol
Everybody…I think we’re gonna get a Bugatti video soon 🤩
And yet another Bitchin video outta All your hard work…. Bitchin
The funniest funniest thing would be if you guys added ferrari  when do this
“Lmbo”  [cause guys got ‘butts not ass’s]
Pretty disappointed no one threw a bowling ball at it. Amateurs.
Hear me out next you should do a 2million dollar yacht durability test before you do the 5 million dollar Bugatti Durability test love the videos man
haha hroke diesel ferrari still runs
I would have loved to see a few drone tracking shots of the Ferrari blasting down a country road in the rain, just sayen.
My guy is literally playing Forza in real life 😂
If F80 does end up destroyed need Uncle Rich or Samcrac or Tavarish to rebuild it
Forza horizon 15 gameplay
You will be sued  and you will lose monster max 2.0 to pay for the legal fees
If your product can survive Cody, it might be worth actually buying. Lol. I'm kinda shocked how well that bubble held up
imma need a part 2
Forza Horizon In Real Life🤪
Me playing forza
Emelia H is dying right now.
This is going to be soooooo much fun to watch!!
Looking like Patty Mayo now other then actually having money in videos
That's an amazing add for the bubble car cover haha
Shld get another hellcat to destroy since you didnt do much with the other one
How did he get the car that company doesn’t sell to anybody maybe he got someone on the inside to sell it to him🤔 The fight will still be legendary🤺😂
Oh fuck oh god he got another hypercar, shit
I actually told myself if I had the chance to ever own a ferrari, I would not take it due to the legal issues. I love this idea mr diesel... For once he is doing gods work.
Real life forza
Bruh…😊
Ferrari has entered the chat
Lamborghini owners must be enjoying every second of the video
The ending had me dying great video!
3:18 Doug Demuro XD hahahahahaha
This is do dumb
If you don't need that engine any more I need a good coffee table.
Best. Video. Ever.
Dear Ferrari, Do the letters FO mean anything to you? Signed, The Bandit  P.S. I do have to give you the point for making a decent looking mid-engine Corvette...unlike those jokers at GM.
He’s playing Forza horizon in his driveway 😂😂😂 gotta love it
This dude is living  real life forza horizon
Gotta love how it sounds it the woods the sounds bouncing the trees
I can just imagine Cody in the ferrari dealer with his bag of prop cash, waiving the registration fees and saying he doesn’t want insurance
vid is corny didn't even destroy it L
@whistlindiesel is the bull and red cars are his red flag
Nice video whistlin👍
The real question here is when the bubble is getting its own durability test. that's insane, congrats on the Ferrari, and also now Ferraris most valued customer.
Cody your a genius!!  You should get a Grammy!
its as if taxtherich100 started filming again
First time you video has been hard to watch!
lol
It’s awesome how you rally a 400000 dollar car like it’s a beater
To all the people calling me “fake” or saying I didn’t do it enough. HERE YOU GO!!! I😂
Wow you guys really threw everything you had at this car 😂
The editing is hilarious lol this video is like gta in real life. Lol
Really hope the person that only put 3,000 miles on it sees this
how is it not scratched to shit after all that? and how the fuck did that car make it up that hill? LOL
BEEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT!!!! YOU DESERVE THIS CAR AND SO MUCH MORE FOR ALL THE JOY / LAUGHTER YOU GIVE US Cody !!! The bubble did good I was expecting it to pop real quick 😂
no way in hell did you get a ferrari certified  dealer to sell you this  I WANNA KNOW HOW YOU GOT THIS FROM THEM
Funny thing about this is that this will still be a great exposure for them. They just like to sue for the sake of suing
Genuinely an amazing ad for that car bubble 😅
Wow that’s a cool.    Fast.    Sports car!
I would put some mud grips on it.
Whistlin never disappoints!!!
Should have thrown k-nifes at it.   Sucks you have a Ferrari now instead of your badass wife.
It's a safety feature so if you hit a fence branch it goes right through their wtf is wrong with this guy 😂 I am pretty sure once ferrari see this you premuch will be banned from ever owning a ferrari pretty sure they will sue you  also I don't think you realize how serious ferrari is they sue people for just changing the paint on their cars
Great job. Love the work you put into content.
You should be more worried about deadmau5 getting upset but laughing at the same time for using is stuff😂
if only you could suspend it in the bubble and roll it down the hill
LES GOOOOO. For every like this receives Ferrari will sue Cody for 1000$
Thx cody u made my day
I'll spoil it. He lives.
Honestly I'm only here for the comments ha
hell yes! lol
The rain of tools never stopped omg
Me making a Ferrari a rally car in Forza, he be doing it IRL
Blow it up
That video was hard to watch, watched the whole thing though somewhere between laughing and cringing. Great video lmao
When can i buy me a jar full of Ferrari 😆
He threw everything at it but the kitchen sink 😂😂😂
it finally happened
fUN STUFF!
I wonder how many people are crying that you got one 🤔 🤣🤣
LMAO at the ending
Damn these videos are expensive!!!!
Bro's playing Forza
The whole video should have just been you guys throwing stuff at that Ferrari in the bubble
Awesome video! I am really curious how much you make with a video like this? Does it pay for this car and you still get profits? If so you are a genius!
I do like your videos. They are somewhat entertaining, but you do realize you are adding to the inflation of this planet. Thanks for making my bills seem way less important.
Beat that crap. Leave the working man’s trucks alone.
Just let me get the seats after you pressure wash them
I’m the kid in the TikTok 💀  Whislin’ Diesel Tested and Approved 💯
Wth that's it I'm OUT 🤘🏽 peace !!!!
The higher ups at Ferrari watching this video mad asf
5:49 OMG 😳
Whistlindiesel 0 bubble a lot lmao
Best video ever 😂
toyota prius toyota prius! i love my toyota prius
absolutely legendary😈
Of all cars. And everything’s he has destroyed. This. This is the best one. I fucking hate Ferrari as a company and the guys behind the suits. Way to shove it to em! Fuck those Italian bastards! I will say, I don’t think I could watch a video of someone doing this to a Lamborghini. I cried when I saw the r32 and I have one lol. I’ll never afford a lambo and I’ll still cry but fuck these cunts!
What're all the cases stacked in the shop? Ammo boxes?
The end was giving me throwbacks to wrench fight. Love it
Dudes playing Forza in real life.
What a loser
Gonna get DF'd, De-Ferrari'd lol.
I'm not sure how I feel about this... shocked, impressed, angry, intrigued ....
Glad it’s not my money
WD having white hair is scary
Fucking Awesome!!
Fuck ferrari
Fuck yeah
Some of your finest work, "This Ferrari means nothin to me".  I wonder how the world would react if you destroyed something truly rare and priceless?  You should purchase and draw a mustache on an original Rembrandt...  All those stuffy faces are begging for it.    Oh, or something by Andy $hitface Warhol...
This is why I love whistling diesel! Absolutely amazing. Laughed my ass off the whole time
Put it in the burnout pit at a cleetus and cars
Please go take it to Ferrari for a service 🤣
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thank you!!!
I hate you so much
Was kinda hoping the excavator bucket was tossed on top of the bubble to see if it could hold up
This video is worthy of an award.
Cheap Ferrari not even awd you been had 🤣
That’s my billionaire ❤️
Anyone else thought he gonna clean it with the excavator?
This was amazing.
Honestly Cody's videos are one of the few good pieces of content that get me excited when I see it pop up. Like Mr beast but for adults
😱 lol
We loosing views wow crazy ass world
Me in Forza be like
Do a durability test on ur own clothing line. My sweatshirt and t shirt are getting stitching and tearing issues after months of wearing every single day. U said it'd be the last shirt and Hoodie I'd ever need!
Real life forza horizon
The bubble performed better than the ferrari
You didn’t destroy it 😢 bum to the er…..
I found this channel when I was looking for boater safety tips. Not only do I know how to ride a jet ski, I now know that I should always rinse my car off before I put it away. The things you learn from a car enthusiast with an attention to detail!
If you paid for it and own it, it's your right to do whatever you want with it. If somebody says otherwise, fuk ya life!
👍 just for the effort it took to throw all that stuff
The plastic bubble vs. Excavator
Excellent!
Dude he went to high school with "lest destroy the mobi dick "
It's your car do what you want with it! The only thing Ferrari can legally do is go after you if it's still on payments. I'm sure it's not!  Enjoy the content as always
Threw everything at it except the kitchen sink!!!
Would look better with spinners
what a legend.. xD
Ahh yes,  its just ur average everyday YouTuber destroying expensive Ferrari in unique ways
This is the finest advertisement for a car ever made
I enjoyed every damn second of this video.
Lol but, why??
This one hurts, I’m a Ferrari guy… destroy it though.
Never, never, never disappoints 😎
chaos incarnate. and subscribe.
I can't believe Ferrari even let you obtain one of there cars🤣🤣🤣🤣 theirs Italians buy your merch now just so they can piss on it🤣🤣🤣🤣 awesome video, you need to total more of these Italian pieces of trash

Awww D: I was hoping it ended like the fire truck LAME! Congrats next make a huge castle out of card board and light it on fire
Ferrari interior has a lot of ugly things about it.
Cant wait to see you do this with a Bugatti
This is brilliant, I really can't wait for the Bugatti durability test!

unexpected Doug Demuro @3:18
I saved for a Team Wendy helmet for my NVGs for EVER and WD here is just rocking it like a bicycle helmet lol
Keep the content rolling!! Best video ever! 🤣

This video is being passed around in ferrari HQ probably about to reach the CEO
Legend lol
Aint no wayyyeayeayeayayuh
Pretty impressed about the car cover tbh
This is just a commercial for the Ferrari and the bubble lol. Great video!!!!
Shouldn’t Cody be saving up for a Bugatti Chiron?
Best $400k you could ever waste   I cant express how much I dislike Ferrari    To say Hate would not express it.  Keep up the great content.
This man went from farm to Ferrari👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Lambo next?
You mother fucker! I love you! Lol
Beautiful love the video!
Man Ferrari should get into Rally Racing lol

That 13:15 mark is legendary 😂 👌
clickbate
Im surprised Ferrari didn't take away his permission well for now
glad to see your testing vehicles the viewers are actualy thinking of purchasing now instead of all those clapped 2nd gens nobody can afford
You forgot to throw the kitchen sink at it.  I was waiting!!!!
Ferrari must be so happy, people finally start enjoying their cars
Classic "Ferrari" scene (from the Rock) - WD has got some tough competition [starting at the 0:51 mark] 🖱https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I-dOh_ih8c&t=51s Wondering if anyone is selling a San Francisco trolley on Marketplace?
Ur having a blessed life keep it up anyway saying hellllllooooo from the middle of Kansas peace
🐋?
How dare you do that to such a beautiful car >:( it deserves to be destroyed for our entertainment
That was so neat!!!
And they're still picking up all the shit they threw.
Never fails to bring quality entertainment. Thanks !
Thats one bad ass balloon. Good shit. Makes a damn good rally car.
This was the coolest shit I've ever seen, cooler than the birth of children.🤣😂
The Ferrari: profe habia tarea! The Class: 13:25
You forgot to throw a sink...
This is the best
I'm 34 urs old. I wanna be like WD when I grow up haha ⚡️
Great advertisement for whoever makes that bubble lmao!!
Dis guy needs help asap
You’re my fucking hero!!!
We’re all gonna have an opportunity to own a part of this car one day when he hacks it into little bits and sells jars.
Add some huge spacers on the rear and mud tires. Plow that field real good. Cut right through 👌
Not sure if I'm more worried about the car, or Cody at this point... 👀
Next week on Detail Geek "You're not gonna believe this Ferrari...".
His lived for these moments all his life. Doing what no ones done
Now this is damn good content
I think he's gonna be sue when ferrari see this. For sure!!!
Furl cut in my car sounds like that. I have proof.
After seeing all of Ferrari's bs this video satisfies me more than it should
Im impressed that this Ferrari can handle so much abuse and have only a few codes on the dash. The bubble test at the end was hilarious!
Finally. Been waiting for a video.
She is beautiful
I truly like all of your videos they are never boring and always keeps my attention. Very few yourtubers can do that. His content is amazing @whistlingdiesel
soo good
what the fuck where did you get all those high grade cases? the wall behind the ferarri in the bubble test looks like a tarkov inventory lol  Cody got 100+ different pelican cases for his guns?
Bubble boy fartrarri
Inflatable car protector stocks 📈📈📈📈
Can you just like send me a cheap car pls 😭
I'm impressed. Not only that you carry on doing what we love to see but also that that car took it so well. That and the bubble performed way better than I imagined.  It even looked cool getting rallied.  I wonder what it would look like on spacers and big offroad rubber. In Utah.
Ferrari is gunna be fucking pissed
The man drives his cars like i drive mine in forza horizon4😂🔥
Ok, I have to admit that I laughed out loud at the "art" Cody added to the the horse.
I'm so happy about this :)
I love this man so much
He better jump this next video
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bro is playing GTA in real life.
Hoodies garage would like to buy the Ferrari now….
You threw everything but the kitchen sink, time for a redo!
He'll yeah!!!
Cool video Cody. Thank you
Still waiting for a mk4 supra and r35 gtr 😂
Awesome vid as usual, the end had me giggling. I'm curious about all those cases stacked up.... full of pew pews?
13:19 Nobody: Me in my bed trying to find my phone
POV Ferrari: 😐
Someone kid dubai could've used that Ferrari. 13:45 where can I get one of those for my car
kinda wish youd bought the goonzsquad ferrari
missed oppurtunity to shoot the bubble with a crossbow last shot lol
Let me drive that thing.
My fav channel
When they stated throwing everything at that bubble 😂 that’s good internet
4:06 "me and ur mom"  - some kid
more
Clickbait
Love all your videos man🤣🤣
And streetspeed thought his off-road C8 video was crazy lol
Quite the endorsement for that bubble. I kinda want one :o
I was actually expecting a brief break followed by a cinder block at the end.....🤣🤣🤣
Dude probably partnered with a CGi genius and be trolling us this whole time 😂
LOL, Cody takes us all for a thrill ride doin' shit in a Ferrari his neighbor won't even attempt in a side by side. We all wanna be Cody for a day.
Loose #unt 👁👃👁❤👈💪
I’m 5 IPA’s in. Made tacos and this video shows up. Love it
karen :some people love that car                         whistlindisel : I dont give a shit
RED SUCKS!!
Get this man a real rally car
I am a bit disappointed... losing touch with Red is Dead mantra
This man needs a taxtherich license plate
The duke boys done upgraded
*frightened Italian noises*
He's literally all of us in Forza or Need For Speed but in real life
You and your crew crack me up man. Keep that content coming man!  Ps… I figured that thing would be shooting flames out the exhaust. Big flames. Just sayin.
Taxtherich100 finally has some competition 😂
I love all the stuff flying at the bubble at the end💀😂😂
that C8 comparison was on point LMAO
😂😂yes! Your an absolute genius! Honestly these car brands should endorse you, I’m sure sales rise after your durability tests.
need to test its towing abilities next..
I’d like to see you jump it!
this video made me just realize that things are just things. it doesn't matter how much it costs, it's just a product and we shouldn't treat them like they're some glass that we have to be gentle with. don't get it twisted, i'm a huge car guy & i love super cars like ferrari and others, but this really made me open a new perspective about how people treat them vs. how they should be treated. but then again, i don't recommend throwing ladders at a $400,000 car 😅
Bro your my idol
Awesome
Up next you should durability test a real WRC rally car to se how durable they really are.
one day i hope to be this stupid rich lol
how long until this gets taken down
A titanium bubble wouldn’t protect that car from you Cody lmao!!!!! Haters are going to be crying on the next video….can’t wait hahaaaaaa
No mud hole?
Bet you won’t put stacks on it
I pissed myself 3 times laughing
Best video ever!
KEEP IT UP.
you should go to a drift even in it!
ngl that car cool badass off-roading
why the hell do you have a nuke in your garage
Love it lmfao bet them  uropeians are are hateing ..can't wait to see more keep it up bro..
The only enjoyable part was the bubble testing 😏. Step it up Whistlinediesel your slippin bro
Forza horizon be like
You should take it to a sideshow
Love it but this is the first time one of the vids hit deep. Lol.
Sick car
Im in tears 😂 i can’t stop laughing. 100000/10 video will raise grandma from grave to share on her FB wall
WD y have way too much cash money ! Can’t wait to see y trash this pile .
this reminds me of the old Taxtherich videos
Hahaha I don't know what to say. Long live bubble rerri! One more vid maybe?
How many letters you think Ferrari is gonna send this guy ?
Video idea: I bought a 992 Gt3rs and gave it to a random 20 year old Swedish guy
When country boys win the lottery. WD we are living vicariously through you my friend. Salute 🫡
Imagine walking through the woods and hearing this thing... I don't think a Ferrari would be first guess!
A video like this is nice to see and not just some guy freaking out about how nice of a machine it is
Looking forward to jars of Ferrari, everyone could own a jarrari
Cease and desist on its way!!!!
That's a SWEET VIDEO! I need one of those bubbles!
This man living his best life 🫡
9:40 Forza irl
Cody's Neighbors:  "Son of a bitch, he got another car. How long do you think it'll last this time, hun?"  Iron balls to be going up against Ferarri like this lmao
U get stop break vehicles quit it enough leave alone what’s wrong u had a problem mental????
Hands down the best video I’ve seen in a while, thank you !
This is one of the best ones lately because I hate car companies that try to tell their customers what to do with their cars.  The durability test is going to to be EPIC.
Sounds Amazing 👏
Freaking awesome content man! Thanks!
ROTFLMBDAO!!!!!  OMG. I'll bet the Ferrari folk are shitting their pants right now. Seriously though, how can anyone tell you that you can't do this if you paid for it and it belongs to you?
Congrats on your first and last Ferrari.
Normal wear and tear.
I'm so happy about this!
That was good advertisement for the bubble company 😂
Been waiting😮‍💨
“Give me a hammer” is a death sentence
FREAKING LEGEND!!!
the hero we all wanted and the hero we all needed. thank you sir
that is a c8
that was the best and most painful video ive ever seen
Man I’m so torn about this video I hate the way Ferrari treats it’s customers there’s a reason jay leno refuses to own one but at the same time it’s so beautiful and so expensive why just destroy it it doesn’t make sense fuck the views and clout that is a piece of automotive art respect it and its 400 grand price tag you just bought you simple simple man
Anyone else like... STOPPPPP 😬😬😬
i hope WhistlinDiesel doesn't disappear
I Love every videos that he posts of destroying nice cars, shits weak 😂
The bubble is wildly strong 💪🏽
This is peak YouTube. Mr Beast could never.
Yes!!
Forza irl
I AM PUMPED
Bro is literally in Forza horizon 🤣
Great vid
Cody i own a pressure washing business in Nashville if you need your car pressure washed with high pressure let me know 😂😂😂

Forza irl pmao
koenigsegg torture test is 100% needed. maybe at 10 mil??
My guy spit on the horse, then aggressively rubbed it off
Ferrari.  Even tough enough for WhistlingDiesel (we hope)!!
OUCH
The Bugatti dream died?
If I was Ferrari I would've gave it to you free & sponsored you.   BUGATTI 😉
I find it pretty hilarious hes actually  trolling Ferrari just to see what they do lol.
I wonder why the durablity /destruction test didn’t happen on the Lambo 😭
I want that bubble!!!!
“No this came free” 😂😂 the tool kit for a 400k car
That car is actually pretty f'n impressive
Best video iv seen for a long time, hilarious 😂
Legend. Drop some more hoodies ninja
And F ferrari. once u buy something  its yours n NOBODY ON THIS EARTH SHOULD BE ABLE TO TELL YOU WHAT TO DO WITH IT!
That bubbles cool as shit, like if it could repel the sun you could use it outdoors if you dont own a garage for you enzo and Bugattis
Enzo Ferrari is rolling in his grave rn
Can't wait till Ferrari see this
That ferrari looks so nice
hilarious lol
you should just get into rally car racing, you get to absolutely hoon vehicles with reckless disregard and sometimes get paid for it  also be the first person to put a Ferrari on an offroad lift kit
that ending was gold
The CarCapsule performs well against ladders and hammers!
This guy is living the fucking dream!!!
What in the spoil backwoods cr****** did i just watch 🤦🏿‍♂️
Damn fine bubble...
Well, the ending didn't seem excessive at all.
Hey Cody when you are done with it can I please have the engine so I can put it in my Fiero Ferrari kit car? Haha thanks 😂
The end was so funny!!!!!!
It off roaded just like I do in grand theft auto
I think that somewhere somehow, Jeremy Clarkson is watching this and laughing his ass off
Some people shouldn't have access to money.
That dudes about to sell allot of car protectors
I'm def getting a Chinese spy balloon for my car
this kid fucking rocks. whistlin diesel never disappoints lol
Mrbeast
You just made the BEST advertisement for this bubble company LMAOOOOOOOOO
I don't know why the Ferrari company is so sensitive my comes to modifications
GTA 5
Geezuz that was a banger good vid diesel!
Was this secretly an ad for the car bubble?
23 23 23 23 Kool 23!
simply amazing no 1 is butter den you lol
If you ever wanna come to colorado and need a place or tools.  Lmk.  All though this hurts my sole.  If it makes money ( it makes cents ) 🤙🏽🤙🏽🤙🏽
When is Cody going to join the WRC with his Ferrari?
So it all started with old junk trucks, then nice trucks turned to junk, then helicopters and heavy equipment now it Lambos and ferraris. Cody your a Beast, keep up the hard work.
I see a bubble test coming soon...
You should hit high jumps with the Ferrari
GIVE IT A GENERAL LEE WRAP :) HAHAAH
Ur such a nutcase i seriously love it lol
the ending had me dying
13:30+ There is now way in a snow ball chance in hell that this butt bubble is #WhistlingDieselAndCrew proof
Great stress test 😁 O and I wanted to say thanks again on letting me win the 2019 Chevy Silverado 4x4 on your last video.( I got got) it's not your fault my man. I'm 52 and I guess a little gullible. Love all your videos. Peace out Cody.....
If you don’t like the wheels on your Ferrari be sure to check out Custom Offset for all your wheel and tire needs
It’s like watching my brother play for a horizon 4😂😂😂
My guy is a menace to society 😂 and I love it he lets us know this is MERICAAAA🇺🇸🇺🇲
I see u can’t afford a Bugatti smh
well, now the first thing that comes to mind when I hear Ferrari is quality content.
Bubble toss masterfully choreographed.
you are a good driver nice ripping around the compound
I think that "spy ballon" was the safest thing he's ever bought.
The china spy balloon can withstand Whistlindiesel, but not a missile.
Lmao had the perfect opportunity to throw the kitchen sink at it 😂
5 STARS MY GOOD MAN
The best F U in history.
Free bubble advertisement in this episode. 😂
Su dinero, su auto... pero que feo ver lo que le espera a este bebe! :(((((
Man I don’t give a rats ass about Ferraris policies or whatever but this car is a work of art such a nice car being destroyed I can’t get behind this it would be more wholesome if you gave it to me and put me in financial trouble 😂
Oh damn, here we go again,i always thought when heard about the lawsuits some did something like this ,of course it's going to be our boy 🔥🔥🔥
This is hilarious 😂 but I love that car 🥺
I think the guy is really entertaining, however, my wife HATES him for some reason.  I can bring him out every time my wife pisses me off.
I can smell the lawsuits in the air
My man literally did this to get Ferrari on his ass - knowing what stance they take.  11/10 alpha move.
The best person to send a durability review to for that bubble car garage😂 I bet they’re happy
Literally thought I was watching a GTAV stream IRL. Best video I've watched in a long time.
ive noticed every car he buys he has a police raidar 😂 and that hair cut though
Dumbass.
Everything but the kitchen sink was thrown at it 😂
I love it
Ferrari tow hook. For when Righty Tighty becomes Righty Loosey.
Cody's how's your financial situation 😂
i need that bubble. for no reason other than to half inflate it  and launch stuff at my neighbors like a blob
People who are upset about the destruction of these semi-mass produced objects must not have children. Or friends..or family..or meaning to their life
I would hate having to explane to my parents what i did for work if i worked for whistlindiesel
Sick
this you-tubers are each day more stupid, dumb and pathetic. did you have anything inside your head.? a brain ?  why don´t you spend that money doing something really interesting , educative and good for society. or go help someone that needs and make yourself proud for making a world a better place.   I understand that you want to provoke and generated controversy but this is only non sense. One of the  most vain, sad and futile videos i ever saw ,,,,  but i see here are many people like you, that enjoyed your videos and the pathetic and non sense things you do.... it looks you have a public that is just like you. that´s why you have 16000 likes... so ... i know you will not stooped and  your vison of the world appear to have some fans. but if you think a little deeper , you will see that you are each day more desperate  and extremist you your videos. hope you don´t regret this master work
I can’t wait to see the next one. And what all those boxes are for in the background.
Ferrari having better off-road capabilities than many "Off-road" SUV's. Amazing
@1:39... that landcruuser tho.
Always said I wouldn’t buy a sports car If I can’t destroy it and buy another one
Lawsuits lolall day with them lol
That car cover is more impressive than the car
i dont think i can afford insurance but when you get done destroying it ill give you 10k cash
Thank you Cody, thank you for this one.
Who else does this absurdly high dollar content?..........There can be only one!
Spy balloon comment was perfect.
does anyone know where he gets all his money? theres no way its all from youtube. I'm genuinely curious
What a shit box smh should of came with all terrain tires
Hurts my ❤
Bro just offended all Ferrari owners
I Will literally TRAde you the Last Hoodie you will EVEr NEed to OwN for one of your Cars…just hit me up you’re getting a KiLLeR Deal here
i thought it would get the same treatment as the GTR R34s u got to see if that F8 was really reliable
I'm so sad, the 5g Virus killed my dog and now I have nothing to put my dick inside when I go to bed.
Ima need that car bubble💳
It would be a shame if a tank ran over a Ferrari.
This looks like Forza in real life 😂😂😂
im ngl i was actually wanted to see him pull up to that reservation with the ferrari all covered in mud with the branch in the hood and just give it to valet
Two more months is all i asked before you did I this
this man is the definition of "Ill never financially recover from this" yet he somehow does
What Forza in real life looks like
"it comes with factory skid plate, that must be for when you're rock crawling"  😂😂😂😂😂😂
What’s with all the military boxes
Epic.
Muffin tin!
The manufacturer of that bubble at the end just got the best advertisement they've ever had.
Nice, thanks for picking Ferrari. Enzo Ferrari was known for having the worst customer service of all car owners. If you called back because of a problem after purchasing a Ferrari, all you wood hear was stories and lies. 😎  ☝️🙏
Sounds so good with that exhaust.
When is the tank getting there
this will piss off the haters soooooo much, i love it. keep doing you bro
I can’t wait to set back and laugh at the backlash this brings😂
I'm actually impressed that Furryti didn't blow up after 10 minutes. I think you got lucky! Actually working one.
Don’t lie bru everyone has always wanted to drift a Ferrari like this or any super car
this is lit 🔥🔥🔥
damn... that's a strong bubble..
He is crazy
People who drive Ferraris have small dicks
Almost pissed myself watching the end of this video😂 keep up the good success man. Love your content
Video should be called “Forza Horizon 5 in Real Life” Lmfao
just came here to say good luck with the lawsuit. very original i know
My face the entire video 😐
That was great, I hope u Jack it up real good.
uncontrollable laughter
Nooooooooiiiiccceeee
bro the cat
That car bubble company stock just went up sooooooo much.  They owe Cody a biggggg thank you in the form of greenbacks lmao
Honestly, this is just one of the best videos Cody has ever made, and my favorite part was the part where they kept throwing stuff in the Ferrari at the end. Please make more videos like this.
13:16 was definitely the best part🤣🤣
should we be worried about all the pelican cases? or do we just ignore that...
Dude this was a total banger since the first minute. The audi r8 vids were kinda borring but this video is gold. Love your work and keep it coming.
How much nos can a Ferrari take? 😂
The ladders.... i'm fucking dying...... llol
The quality of the comedy of these videos is insane, this channel has evolved so much since the beginning and yet stayed so true to itself – in the best way. 😎👍
Need to turn it into a go kart.
A muffin pan?
Hear me out: Asphalt.
Tax the Rich: American version.
I'm worried about how fast ur boi spit on that horses cock.
Im actually really happy you tested that balloon car cover thing cause the dude on tiktok tests it like he himself doesnt trust it lmao so I'm glad it's getting a real test finally
Man I love Ferrari what a beautiful car can’t wait to see what you do to it it’s almost to nice to destroy please destroy it by putting a bunch of nos/boost through
F**k it 😅🏁
Why?
Every post this man just makes better and better stuff
Fun fun fun
let Ryan Tuerck drive itttt
Bro just went How to basic mode at the end of video 💀
Let me know if you ever want to go fishing on one of the lakes/rivers around your area. I live within an hour of your area. I'll supply the boat as long as it doesn't have to be destroyed.
forza horizon in real life.
I remember taking my new red car in the back 40 to learn how to drive it. Right away, big ol dent in the pass side door
this one hurts more than the others
The dudes from VINwiki are losing their collective shit right now
Lfg
Wild how you were doing this in your first video to a 8,000$ truck. And now this  is action we get  ✊🏾✊🏾🔥🔥🔥
I havent laughed so hard in a while but that ending was so funny haha I wish i could seen behind the scenes of you guys grabiing everything and throwing stuff.
Bros playing Forza Horizon in real life💀
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Waiting for the lawsuits from Ferrari   👇
That bubble company better use that footage in an advert 😂
Cease and insist letters , yeah.!
That is probably the happiest Ferrari on the planet
It hurts to watch
You are an absolute animal and I fucking love every bit of it 🙏🏻🙏🏻😂
There is no way that Ferrari will out jump the General Lee .....Prove me Wrong !
I love your videos they are awesome and that Ferrari went up the hill so good
This is fucking amazing
I'm getting DDE vibes from this👍
Bro he got a 6 star wanted level not 5
The first thing that comes to my mind when you say Ferrari is Testarossa.  In my age bracket, you grew up with that or a Lamborghini Diablo poster on your wall.
No no no no my Ferrari was white, like Don Johnson’s in Miami Vice
EPIC!!
Ferrari should be paying to use this content in their advertising
That looks like so much fun lol
Like some forza stuff going on here
I dunno i feel like you held back a little.... was expecting more tbh. Still great video love the content
Is that a wall of ammo?!
https://youtube.com/shorts/4pIrFWo2bZg?feature=share
Real life Forza Motorsports driving.
That bubble nonsense should be their commercial!!
I heard the skid plates were there for when owners want to grind a sick rail.
I need one of those Bubbles
I am in freaking tears over the ending. Good shit. 🤣
I don't know. I think this video ranks up in the top 3 for me. This is fantastic. Love the drain hole in the hood....or is that actually the "tow hook"? *wink wink*
love your videos
Man dad's going to be so mad when he sees this
forza horizon irl
NICE 😎💪🇺🇲
https://youtube.com/shorts/gpgZ_3Vb0v0?feature=share
That bubble company owes you money for their new commercial
And to think people were pissed when he was wrecking old Chevys.
i look forward to each mf video you create man hahaha. you will forever be in my yt search bar
To be honest with you my heart is jumping
The only thing that can top this, would be a Bugatti. For Bugatti reasons.
Now if a certain English man could hurry up with a certain tank.... 🤣
https://youtube.com/shorts/MJn63ueXQ1k?feature=share
How to Basic video, whistlin diesel version
Best content on the internet!
Looks like head a gta character it’s such a crazy idea
atleast let me drive it first bro
Real life forza
Amazing
Probably your first vid that increased a cars resale value.
Really dumb to buy a expensive car just to destroy it especially Ferrari since they will probably do something about it since they don't like people painting their cars certain colors they don't like people destroying their cars on purpose you keep sell a Ferrari Under a year or so I guarantee somebody's gonna report this or Ferrari's gonna find out about this and do something about it It's too nice of a car to be destroyed it's one thing if somebody rucks on accident but destroying it on purpose is not even cool   After watching the video you didn't really destroy it except for smashing it into a gate and ripping through dirt So you basically clicked bait on the title you don't just buy a bit because those 2 little things aint really destroying it But still not funny the smash a Ferrari into a gate
Boner
What is the name of the bubble
Love this video!!!!!!!!!
This is sick.
Whyyyyyyyyyy
I hope the guys who made that balloon paid you for that endorsement
The last few minutes were comedy gold, I actually lol
Can’t wait to order a jar of Ferrari mulch .
lol next do a bugatti lol or take one those supercars to super truck track lol
Daily uploads are back !!!!
We will be coming to collect you and your family, we will treat you the way you treated our car.
There’s a difference between being rich and having the money not to care this video proves that
Olympic ladder throwing
Always hit the like button before the first 3 seconds of the video Always has the best content
Off subject but what is in all them case up against the wall.?
can that car's airbag protection thing it from tornado debris or hurricane winds?
It’s amazing to see people actually using Ferraris and not worrying about it
Oh man... this was a buttcheek squeezer..  I'd just give my right arm to drive one of these cars...  Please don't take me up on that.
You may be peaking Cody. Do a cruise ship next
Though I know he'll never read this I'd just like to say God Bless You Mr Diesel! You sir, are an artist, possibly the greatest this world has ever seen.....
Can't afford a 458? It's their bread and butter.
Nothing special. I just did this yesterday       On forza🫥
more money then brains 🤣
Best car review ever !! 😂😂😂😂
Can we please bring back old content mixed with new? I think this car is a perfect candidate for spiked wheels 😂
Ferrari about to 6 degrees of separation blackball whoever sold him this car 😂😂😂😂
i want to see a fling the door open and slam it as hard as you can test
Ferrari Will literally hire people to make sure this man does not obtain another Ferrari after he see this!  😂😂😂
That Ferrari is a beauty.  This is also good advertisement for That balloon protector
Can we get more drifting in the Ferrari
$tx512josh 💪🙏
YEE YEE
That bubble company should have paid for the car, WOW..
You……… are the man!
This is how they drive cars in action movies i fucking love it. Keep sendin
#UseToBuildTractors
I’m a fan of Ferrari but I see what you’re getting at they’re a bunch of a bitches.
Do me a favor,  donate the value of what you are going to destroyed., to a charity that can use the money. That would justify what you are doing.
The Best Video Yet
You threw an R/C car at a Ferrari?? WTF!
POV me in forza
YES YES YES ABSOLUTELY one of the best videos WD has put out! 🖕Ferrari. This video is sponsored by Koenigsegg!
Next up: koenigsegg durability test
W editor 🤝
Squash that red turd
#RENTAL
Imagine some guy just going for a hike in the forest and just starts hearing *Ferrari Noises* 👁️👄👁️
It's fkn whistlinkana!!! Ferrari edition!
Great vid !!!!
IM DEAD 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can you please use the bubble as a trampoline
Literally gta in real life your an animal
Menace 😂
Looks like he’s playing forza horizon in his yard 😂
😂
WD doing what we all wish we had the money and the balls to do!!!!
Exactly what a Ferrari deserves 🤘🏻💯
Holy shit I did not expect that ending lmao, got a good laugh out of me
Now this is what you call entertainment😂💯
That's one of my dream cars i wish i had the opportunity just to test drive it because i can't buy it never in my life
This is exactly why Ferrari won't normally sell a high end Ferrari to just anyone. Love to see it lol.
Fcking amazing
Honestly, I'm glad about this. Some of us are tired of the Ferrari "exclusivity".
THAT BUBBLE IS LITERALLY A TOYOTA HILUX 💀💀💀💀💀
And this is why ferrari hates youtubers
"To protect it from things like helicopter crashes" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is awesome!!!
Love it!!!!
Bro really playing forza in real life
car is still in one piece, disappointed
Is wet
On this episode of... "how rich are you?" 👀😅
When you were throwing stuff at the car in the bubble, you forgot the kitchen sink.
Be careful Ferraris like to break into chunks like the titanic and kill everyone inside.
Oh he’s definitely mama’d his last-a Mia
That bubble at the end is actually impressive as fuck
The ending was amazing as always.
Honestly bro not to shabby on the driving Edit* that ending tho 👌
That's a wild video
My stress level when you were throwing shit at the car 📈💀
hell yeah brother
I'm pretty sure if Enzo was still alive he would just come to your house and shoot you if he saw this.
So far this is only doing Ferrari justice as far as advertisement goes .. likely to land number 1 in trending with one of these videos
I just came here to talk about the bubble and how hella MF's gonna buy one now
The bubble test felt like a Family Guy cut scene.
Sick🤙
someone wouldnt be on Ferrari's good list again lol
Hahahahahaha beautiful
No you didn't.  :)
Since I had the notifications on can I have one of the badges? Also I had a smile on my face the whole video because you’re the only one that does Gods work
Knowing what I know about Ferrari, this is hands down the best car/manufacturer you could've chosen for this type of video... love it!
I think it should have wheel spacers and mud tires
Next video, WE TURN A FERRARI INTO A RALLY CAR!!   God it's honestly so damn entertaining
How do I get hired to throw stuff at the car?
Pure laughter. Thanks 🤣🤣
i think every man and boy in this life dreamed at least once of affording to trash a Ferrari :)))
Now that makes me say :  Hell yeah brother
Best Chanel on YouTube bar none hahahahahahaha Enzo is rolling around in his grave
Whistlin is a legend
Now this was a good WD vid
bruh the end almost made me fucking shit myself.  nice work brother. figure out the ways to make it keep coming
I've never been on the edge of my seat for a video in my life... JESUS
12:12 I'm dead 💀
This was the hardest video to watch
bro playing real life Forza
That exhaust sounds amazing. Definitely my favorite Ferrari now besides the LaFerrari.
Was really expecting the excavator to smash down on top the bubble at the end lol. I imagine Cody isn't in a position to actually destroy this thing beyond repair but it would be funny to see him put a lift kit(if they make that) on the front and have the first squatted ferrari. I'm sure ferrari would love the straight pipes and purple fur interior.
Dumb
If you ask me I think that Ferrari is shiting all over your other cars hahahahaha
Enzo would’ve appreciated how you drive it lol
best video ever ferrari going to kill you
WD: nothing can withstand my durability tests  The Bubble: 🫡
This guy has to much money
NFS in real life
Air bubble company needs permission to run the last sketch as an ad
Este man sabe 😅🤣
lol i love seeing people destroy expensive shit and ppl that didn't pay a dime loose their shit! i really don't know why pp worry about what other ppl do with their shit!
Knew he wouldn’t destroy it 😂
Put some mud tires on it. I bet it does better .

Take that to silver lake
Tear it up!!

My dad owns Ferrari.
the ending is such a good advertisement for the car bubble lmao
DDE already beat you to  the punch with  beating the shit out of super cars but you do it just a bit harder lol good job
What this video told me is that wd is genuinely an EXTREMELY good driver. Rallying a 2wd ferrari with 700 hp up a gravel road without immediately running into a tree is actually fucking insane. 10:00 what a legend :D
Cody: Lets not hit anything Him at 7:04
That fucking bubble just got the best product review in history. That thing is bad ass.
Look I’m a very impressed but I was waiting for the sick edit of the car before any thing happened to it
I couldn’t give a fuck about Ferrari or any other fancy shit my only thing I gotta say is that’s a whole lotta money to waste to prove a point but Carry on! 😂
By FAR the funniest WD vid I've ever seen 🤣🤣🤣
He has gone soft
Tug war that bitch with the r8 and the g wagon
bros a menace
Let me be the first to say: cease and deez nuts.
the mf that sold that balloon just got a whole ass ad from whistlindiesel himself
I think I’m sold on the bubble.. may need one.
Sick!  Boi !
You see a Ferrari I see Carl 😢lol
Omg yes lmfao
13:18 my man threw the whole construction site at that car
Whoever sold him this Ferrari is in hiding rn 😂😅
I NEED ONE OF THOSE BUBBLES.
Damn now I want a Ferrari
Giving me some hot pursuit 2 vibes ripping the trail
I love the video keep it up but why kill a Ferrari
i wish i money just to waste it like this
There’s some videos I know I should really just watch as soon as they come out, and this is one of them lmao.
can i have the gas cap when your done with it pls?
This was amazing....keep em coming
When you have too much money: But that car bubble was sick.
Do a speed test in first gear
Have you seen were the battey is my boss has one and his caught fire from the turbo it took Ferrari almost a yr to fix it didn’t even give him a loaner at all
Considering you made them look good I don’t think you have to worry about any Ferrari wrath.
I'll take the car after your done 🤣
when the student reminds the teacher of homework 13:15
At first I was a bit taken back by this Channel and the waste of resources, but I've learned to appreciate it and thank you for what you do
You sir a winner, that is how you drive a car,  i was happy watching your entire video, you have 10/10 content...
This is dumb af doesn’t even have boggers on it smh
can i have it?
Lol funny as shit
This is endo fairzarro from the grave and I endorse this video
LoL
First
ive been waiting for this... So much Instagram hype
lmao after hearing so much about ferrari dealerships their lawsuits jay lenos experience etc im ashamed i never thought about cody buying one and blowing their minds
bro why
But that bubble be strongville
I live for these videos
I'm surprised he let it survive this video😅
I cannot wait for you to destroy that Bugatti. I hope you absolutely wrap it around a tree. Id pay 100s of dollars to see those builders cry as they see their machine get beatttt
Ferris Bueler style Ferrari jump please!
Glad to see you back!
when Forza Horizon 5 becomes real life!
Cody If the engine of the Ferrari melts, change the engine for a duramax
If it's red it's dead..
I feel pad for the guy that has to fix all your cars
Ken block the second? (Kody block)
I can’t wait for the super swappers and the mud pit In Indiana 😂😂😂😂
Haha what a beautiful car even better now 🤘🏾😆😆😆😆😆😆
🏌️‍♂️🎯
lmao, the best ending :D how many people were throwing all that stuff?
More then 100k in a hour
Me: on Test Drive Unlimited
FUCK FERRARI
It's hard to believe just a few years ago you were doing burnouts on banana peels, now you are doing Ferrari hill climbs. Well done sir.
All you’re doing is selling Ferraris now lol
I've noticed on top gear, when whistlin diesel was stuck in the weeds, and other places I cant think of right now, that modern cars freak out and go into limp mode when you spin the tires. We think of certain old vehicles as fun, I wonder what people in the future will think about our current vehicles and there technological safety systems in the future.
Feed an X9 combine rocks
🙌💪💯 thank you for the content!
LMAO!!!
awesome vid man i lost it when all the stuff started flying thats good wholesome fun
Full send!
I love anything that pissis rich people off!!🔥🤘🏼
I’ve been waiting!!!! HELL YEAH!!! I love these videos!!!!
This video was considerably more mellow than i expected.
idc if you ruin it, but personaqlly i think it would piss more ppl off finally if you kept this one like your audi but again its your car so idc if you wreck it, either way its gonna be sick to see
So you want to trigger Ferrari to a possible lawsuit just for a yt video?
That car is indestructible. You should try to skip it across a lake like the Lambo on the movie Speed Zone.
He’s really living that GTA lifestyle
Nice touch with the lambo cover
CEO. - DId you see what this guy did to our car  Lawyers: Well he paid for it, he can do as he wishes CEO: I don't pay you to tell me what i know, you need to sue him and let it be a teaching lesson to others Lawyers: Well he is paying us millions to draft paperwork that won't hold in court  3 DAYS LATER  WhistlinDisel: Well guys am been sued by Ferrari.  24HRS LATER  New video.  WhistlinDisel: I bought a FERRARI 812 GTS will it drag the dumpster to the road    LAWYERS: We tried.
This the guy that does real shit in real life like what I be doing in GTA.
Man in forza 5
I love this
Absolutely legendary content yet again Cody! On the edge and miles over the edge at the same time 😂😂😂
Bro got a preemptive cease and desist letter when they heard he was interested
If I was an automaker I'd give Cody one of all my models to test all possible design flaws
Okay now i want a car bubble.
I’ll donate a lifted Tahoe for you to destroy what do you say
From what this channel started as to what it is now is awesome!
Dude I was laughing so hard when the onslaught of tools and anything you could get your hands on were raining down on that bubble. Messed up but wicked funny. Haha
The screams every time he threw the ladder out of frame had me dying😂 12:55
Lifelong band: Activated
😂
Damn this thing sounds sick
you're living in a dream
This man’s playing forza horizon 5 in real life
cody you should buy a rally car
Homeboy can drive.
That bubble thing is awesome!
I still remember the first time I bought a $400,000  Ferrari.  Good times
Bros my hero fr😢
🤩👏👏👏 Happy to see a new never-clickbait video! Keep it up, Cody. This video made my day :D
I hate that I love this.
If you can fight a splashing court case, Ferrari stands no chance
Nice, can't wait to see more testing.
This driveway might be more dangerous than the border
Gotta give it to him he knows WTF he’s doin 🤘🤘🤘
Nice!
oh it's gonna be a lengthy complaint
What’s in the military looking crates behind the Ferrari at the end of the video?
How do you insure it or you don't and just send it?
4:00 I remember the 2022 r place with he pixel art. Sometimes you just gotta give the horse a cock 🤷‍♀
Here for the Ferrari mulch and the next giveaway
I would never imagine watching one of my dream cars getting treated like a RC car and enjoy watching it🤣
Let the butt hurt begin
Jeeeeezzzz😂😂😂
Cody, you never disappoint with your content!.. but Ferrari may feel differently 😅
you should get another duramax like you had back in the day
This is the only way it should have gone, thank you for consistent content
What a legend
Im crying
I’m impressed by that car bubble thing
Thumbs up baby! Fuk it up WD!
Ending was top choice 😂😂
13:20 just the best part of any yt video I have ever seen
holyyyy fuck.....
"Excellent"
How does the car handle all that stuff thrown at it without that Bubble protection. I hope to see that 👌
My only complaint is that the video ended.
Homeboy is just pretending to destroy it to justify his purchase of another exotic car.  This will be the entirety of him dEsTrOyInG it. 🥴🤦🎉🤔
The only thing I didn't see them throw at it was the kitchen sink LOL
LOL! This man is a legend
This man can work the wheel no lie😂😂😂
Let's gooooo
When did forza horizons graphics get so good?
Hey WD. I fucked your wife❤
Im surprised you havent already put on a cool amazon spoiler or put on a honda muffler or wrapped it in hello kitty stuff yet with the drift hand stickers on your gas tank!
Bro gonna be hearing from legal if its true
How can Ferrari do anything? If you own the vehicle outright. It's not their property or their money.
If I ever get a nice nice car im buying one of those bubble things it seems cool af
As a super car enjoyer and a person who likes to watch things get destroyed, this was both painful and entertaining.
Why does whistling diestle only destroy cars and shoes… I think that you should be making more than two communities mad at this point.
This is actually some great advertising for Ferrari and the bubble company!
I can already see the cease and desist letter in the mail
Literally so funny great content
Ask demolition ranch if they bubble is bulletproof
Love these videos! Fuck snobby car makers that try to control you because you bought their product. I wanna be in a video destroying something expensive lol
Of course it's red why wouldn't be. Now he can conveniently destroy  it and not care .🤣🤣🤣🤣 Love the content.
i want it😂
now let's see if the bubble will protect it in a flood lol let's see if it'll float 😈
The Ferrari dealership went on lockdown when this video was uploaded
I feel dirty all over watching this. I'll probably watch it twice.
What a nice land cruiser in the background at the start of the video
The only reason half is fans hated him is because he was destroying his girly fans precious little trucks they all dream and want. It’s funny how now since he’s done smashing American trucks, those haters turned into fans enjoying him smash supercars. His fan are the one who have always liked his content, not those haters who eventually grew to like him.. fake fans bevsuse the second he smashes another f250 the comments will lose their mind. Shitty American trucks
whats it like having money
god i love this guy 😂 i’d probably do the same with the car
Made my day bud😎👍
Ford and chevy taking notes
This should be the ad for the bubble
What’s with all the cases?... planning for an apocalypse or something
Best Ending ever 😂😂😂
This video makes me Feel sexxy! Thank you!
I’m sure Ferrari it’s shipping you a new one you did great with this one bud
You never disappoint hope this gets 50mil views
Macaronilicious
That is actually a sick car.
Yes. You stole Tyler's car.
I have to say I'm really impressed by the bubble . I wonder, do what if your car was I don't know fall into a lake ...would the air filled bubble stop it from sinking
In about ten more years this guy will be able to afford to crash the moon into earth, and then do it.
Cool
Cody is just playing Forza Horizon irl at this point and its hilarious
Ohio
Dammit Cody! That was one of the most entertaining videos I've seen all week. Great job!
Dude I get it because you can but most people who may watch your channel this breaks my heart this beautiful car that I would give my right nut for your going to destroy but that's you and I totally agree but do it on a fn corvette a new one not a classic super car just because you can not cool you want to wreck or blow shit up buy some tnt and blast some earth find some gold just my opinion ty azzhat
Your D!@$ was bigger with the Cheez It Ranger Ferrari
This is Beautiful, I'm going to put Ferrari emblems on my car and see what Ferrari does and I'll get back with you on that Cody. God bless ❤️🔥🔥💥💥💥
The price of the Bubble Protecter after this video 📈📈📈📈📈
I'm shocked the bubble actually worked, lol
What the hell is even that??!!!
I’m more impressed at his ladder selection…he has one for every occasion lol
Thank you for doing this
I'm curious why the Lamborghini has gone untouched?
I cant wait for lil red to be dead hehehehe
That Ferrari would be perfect for recreating Hoonigan's Townuts.  #KB43ver
I needed this video today, I have NOT been doing well and have been hanging on by a thread. Thanks for this!
Lawsuit 1st, fun later, divorce 3rd that's how it goes😂😂😂
The man with the fantastic stache was using his eyes to say this boy is wild but I’m making money so proceed.
You should make it the rzr rarri
People bouta be so pressed
the shots in between every tool thrown were just too good. 🤣The details are crazy good job.
There's a Ferrari engineer watching this crying right now.....
You should totally easy unload it off the back of monstermax
milk the Ferrari for view’s please
After all Ferrari ain't that unreliable
You don’t have to destroy the car. Ferrari have be crappya long time.
I really just appreciate the backdrop of military boxes behind the Ferrari that they are throwing entire toolboxes and ladders at! 😂👌
Threw everything, but the kitchen sink at it.
bro but why ..... :(
was expecting you to shoot it a couple times at the end
Awesome! Can't wait for the next one!
......but was it a Bugatti....no...no it wasnt
What combat uniform is that?
missed opportunity to cosplay as magnum pi, & chase bad guys wearing hawaiian shirts.
Yes yes yes yES YES YESS
Hahaha I love it! I missed you SO much!!!!!
You are the greatest guy of all time! Damn this was epic!
Ferraris new contract is gunna include do you know who whistln diesel is if you check mark it you gunna get denied
😂awesome
I'm honestly not mad
Ferrari should be proud of the reliability!
Ferrari about to send you a letter ☠💀☠
Ok Andrew Tate lol
damn,  its a dope car lol
The ending needs to be an ad for the car bubble.
I love this so much Cody
Bro the guy that sold him this Ferrari is getting fired 💀
you should zip up he car in the bubble and let it run until it dies of lack of oxygen
metallica of cars
"Pimple Puss VS Ferrari -  The Reconning" would've been a better title IMHO. And Pimple Puss sounds like a good channel name :P
Holding up better than I thought it would so far
I swear every car your not supposed to do this shit you he’s gonna get ‘em n do it anyways.. soon this mf gonna buy a pipe car n fuck it up too 😂
all i know is that this is the best ad to exist for that car cover/capsule . their stocks went up 500% after this video went live lmfao. now i want one.
Anxiety levels watching this 📈
This one hurt me a little bit😂
Destroy it
It’s like real life Forza
Yezzus Christ!  Brandon Herra:  I’ve been on YouTube for almost 20 years and post recycled content with little to no money and time invested  Whistlin Di<knead:  Spends a lot time, money and effort to keep us entertained.  Let’s never forget the man who drove in the ocean for us   PS:  That car bubble test isn’t valid, next time you need that Female Waffle House Employee for the Ultimate throw test!
The bubble copped a hiding, and survived.
Do you really think they give a hoot you're the moron you just paid $400,000 for it who's the sucker you are them be honest.. you bought into their 🐂
Thank you. That’s all
I wanna see that thing get some air.
Ok I’m definitely buying a jar when he shreds this one.
Having been to the ferrari factory in Maranello IT. Your driveway looks mint compared to the roads there. You need a lift kit for all the potholes there.
Bet he won’t chop this one up and sell little jars..😂😢🥴🤯🤦‍♂️
Where rest of video man
I wonder what Ferrari would do if you converted one of their cars into a pickup truck?
The amount of stuff thrown at it in the end was impressive 😂
Petition for Whistlindiesel to blow up a TESLA!!
This one gonna be painfully enjoyable
If its red its dead.
Ferrari has freaking unleashed the Bots in the comments!! Holy smokes Batman they are everywhere!!!
I felt like a was watching a Family Guy episode when they started throwing things at the bubble..
Cody "Ferrari destruction video" Reality: commercial for a car bubble.   Who'd have thought the star of the video would be the bubble?
At the end there it became a pretty legit product review for that bubble thing, pretty impressive. Oh and that duct from the front bumper out the hood is the patented Ferrari Squirrel Saver, a modest $10k option that sucks them up off the road and shoots them over the car to keep them safe and not destroy the entire car... 🤣
Man why aren't you partnering with that bubble car protector company. That was seriously impressive the amount of shit you threw at it and it didn't touch the car! I actually laughed out loud when that was happening. Hopefully I don't get sued for my comment!
LETS GO!!!!!!!!
Patiently waiting for the tank
Can I get one of those bubbles as bomb shelter
I’ll be waiting for his new instagram post of what happens next with Ferrari themselves lol
I gotta lie that bubble was pretty impressive 👌
That ending has to be the funniest thing you have ever done, and the somebody give me a hammer" was the perfect way to set it off.  I'm not impressed by it's off-roading other than how little it bottomed out.  With that much power anything could off road for a day or two.  I look forward to real tests, live tug of war with your tank or monster max 2.
The Ferrari in the field was actually sick
I was laughing so hard at the ending I pulled a stomach muscle....!
I shed a tear on this one.
Yes you did . Yes you did 😊
Rattle can it pink
Pagani: This guy will be banned from buying Pagani's car
the screams after every ladder throw 🤣💀. these videos are just getting better and better.
You needa get some offroad tires and alil height it'd better.
Sickkkk!!!!
Whistlindiesel is the brightest light in such dark days.. thank you, never fails to crack me tf up 🤣🤣🤣 much love
It looks really good doing what it’s not supposed to
U make the best content on YouTube or any other place.
1:00 lol bro
Looking forward to the backlash from the butthurt Ferrari fan boys.
Ansioso prós próximos vídeos 🤣🤣🤣🤣🔥
Ferrari lawyers entered the chat*
Hey bro do one show on how you donate some money to a cause.
Summoned how2basic for the end of the vid
im curious how that bubble will hold up
i usually love you content destroying cars but this one hurts.. please buy me a subaru rally car cody. car+me= world titles
13:46 when a ladder cleared the whole bubble thrown from like 10-15ft back 💀 I bet Cody threw it 😂 im lmfao. Love the video. Love the fact you bought a 400k 2020 Ferrari
If you see this Ferrari suck my cock
car bubble sales just rose 100%
Give it a lift kit with mudders
Whistlindeisel drives like rich people wish they could. actually enjoying the cars he buys instead of preserving them. Good lad!
reminds me of that Simpsons episode when Mr Burns adopted Bart and gave him a Ferrari to drive
i bet the ppl who made that bounce house car cover didnt even think it would work that good and now have the best demo ever for the product
I'll start saving up for my Ferrari mulch now...
fuck yesssssssss
Poor car
Unironically this is great free advertising for that car bubble company.
You’re going to heck
WD out there playing Forza in real life
This thing is scary fast on dirt with sticky road tires. It needs some off road tires stat. Even snow tires would probably do the trick. Cody's probably just gonna jump straight to paddles anyway though.
13:16 this dude did the New Years fireworks with items being thrown at the Ferrari 😂😂
I believe somebody already did this with a Ferrari Enzo years ago
I legit laughed out loud at the attack on the bubble on the car 🤣 excellent video Cody, thank you ☺️
Bro is in Forza
"What's red is dead"
Something tells me that WD low-key wants to be Top G.
I wish Ken Block could’ve seen this
Cody your  videos  are great
At the end the cat and the wrench get me laughing so hard.
I’ve never waited so long for a video
Not the losi baja rey
I didn't know I needed to see this...BUT I DID!
I’ve always loved the content but this ? Best shit I’ve seen in a long time.
This dude driving the Ferrari like its Forza
Great video. 👍
The people who complain about you wearing fatigues are so annoying. “We earned the right to wear those, you didn’t” - like, ok, yeah, they did but….clearly you are just doing a bit in a segment of your video.
Forza in real life 😂😂
they should sell the clip of them throwing things on the bubble. This is THE best ad you could ever have for that product
amazing. simply amazing. cody will always find a way to make others cry and complain about what he does with his money🤣
Gods work 🙏🏼
this was sick ! up to part 2 😂
You need to take this to the dunes like you did with the G wagon
Savage
Common w wslinlindeisl
Keep Him Safe Ppl!!
I dont know why i felt more sad when you destroyed the toyota hilux.
I pray to the car gods you contacted the car balloon people for a sponsorship.
the millon dolar video dude!!! please regalame un auto!!!!! jajajajaja el que sea. si es un RC no importa.
I love this shit
I heard Ken Block is hiring...     In HELL!!! 🔥 🔥 🔥
I was waiting for a kitchen sink to go flying the test that bubble. Honestly surprised it held up to everything chucked at it.
Okay this one definitely hurt my feelings, can’t wait to be able to do this kind of stuff
This dude has more talent than Hollywood. We need a WD movie! lol
Well since you don’t you want the Ferrari can I have it 😂
Homie can drive tho 😯👀
This is epic! 😂
The real Forza epic review.💨💨💨
I'm so bummed I didn't get a chance to see you. I work across from where you got this worked on lol I definitely heard it though. I'm betting you are putting a whole new wide body kit on this so this video is amazing since the company can be such douche bags
This is just your average Forza Horizon player.
you are a Dum ass
Sooner or later this guy will buy a planet just to destroy, nice.
Hammer bit is up there. Lol
That’s ENTERTAINMENT!
The hills of Tennessee have never had a Ferrari doing donuts on them! Epic video!
oh my god cody
OMFG the End with the bubble im Dying over here !!!!!!!!
That’s where the start of that Pink Floyd song “money” came from
I honestly don’t know how far he will go if he gets a Koenigsegg and if he does what can he do to top that
You need to make a rally car out of it , that car is so nice and I love the way u treat it
"Turffari”
Bro why would you do that to a luxury  car some poor people would love to own a car like that be more appreciative of the things that you own.
Me the whole time 👁️👄👁️
Not gonna lie that protection bubble did pretty good. Will it stop a .50 BMG tho?🤔
I love this shi man
This is better than streetspeed717's video where he went offroading with his c8
you definitly need to contact that bubble compagny and sell them the vids as ads they would make a killing 🤣
I think Doug DeMuro is going to cry when he sees this... 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Now we're talking
Alternate title: playing Forza Horizon in real life
love it, been waiting for you to drop a new video. ferrari should use your video for marketing held up great!
Good work!  This had me laughing constantly!  😂
The ending was the best AD that bubble brand could ever ask for
Dude, you have balls as big as a Chinese spy balloon!!  😂😂😂😂
Love to see these cars actually getting used and not sitting in some garage because some rich bozo doesnt want a little scratch on it
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Shiiiiiiiiiii, maaaaaa!!!!!
Bubble thing did good😂
What are all the cases in the shop for?
Forza irl
You’re a legend! I 😂😂😂 the bubble
This man is just playing forza horizon
Finally. Someone who is willing to stand up to the Ferrari overlords for the greater good
Good ol' whistlindiesel!! SUCCESFULLY making life a videogame!
I need me one of those bubble deals
Neutral drop it?
love you content but if destroying it just give it to me its a dream for some people for fuck sake lol
I mean obviously it's supposed to be driven like that! Pretty damn impressive!
YES PLEASE I LOVE THIS
Can I come hangout so, maybe i can drive my car off a cliff, you get views n I get out of this life win win
Man o man, im gonna vote for you! <3
Bro how come this isn't a Hulu car documentary yet this is top quality
Forza horizon 5 players be like
You could’ve at least got an all-wheel drive
Holy shit. This is nuts. Over the top dude
NICE FIERO
Italian Cars seem Surprisingly Reliable ❤
Hands down the funniest video you've posted🤘🤘🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The Bugatti durability video is gonna break the internet
One of your funniest videos yet
That car looks like a blast to drive.
Here before this blows up
I think you should use this as a free rental car in Detroit and see what happens
DDE gonna love this!
Man that Ferrari looks good sliding around in the dirt
Surely add a Prelude into that collection
No no no it’s here and I don’t wanna look away
UR SO UNGRATEFUL
you should see if that bubble cover can repel a 50 cal bullet
Cody I’d say if they do sue go through with it and buy another one because of our amendment “nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life and limb” meaning you should be trialed twice for this offense as it’s already happened to you
I can't wait to see the first Ferrari gets destroyed 😀
Straight outta Forza
The best Ferrari Video I've seen LOL
I'm surprised they even let you buy one
What an idiot
Well worth the wait. Wonder if ole horse company is seeing blood red ?
fuck ya ive been waiting for this
Maybe the real Ferrari is the lawsuits we made along the way
looks like an action movie 😂😂sick 🔥👍
Dangit man. Glad you’re alive.
Mans playing Forza Horizon IRL
Bro this one's hurts
I was waiting for this
People forget that Ferrari once made rally cars, and would have participated in group b, but people insisted on dying, ruining the fun.
Its painful to watch but i Love it.
F$&k yes! 😂
Lol great video
Cody is just playing Forza in real life.
Cody that was my favorite Ferrari😂😂😂😂hilarious bro great job
Bro is playing forza in real life
Dude , this was great !!! Lmfao ….
473 Ferrari owners have seen this video.
Love your ferrari
This should become a Ferrari commercial, I mean come on! That off-road capability is incredible
It looks like you threw everything at it but I didn't see the kitchen sink
Anyone else suddenly more impressed with the Car Bubble?
You won’t do this with Porsche 911 you can’t it’s just an ideal sports car ( I just want to see him destroy a Porsche)
Well, I guess I was wrong, no competition jump between the General and Lil' Red.
Ferrari after watching the video:  *My lawyer advising me not to finish this joke:* hi
Was definitely worth to wait can't wait to watch more of the Ferrari videos
how to: first and last new ferrari 😂
Honestly that bubble thing looks great for you. I didn’t really want a 458 before but now I wouldn’t mind one haha and I bet Ferrari is still going to piss their pants over this
Me in forza horizon
plot twist: Ferrari sponsored this video and provided the car free of charge lol
Dudes playin real life gta 5 at this point
11:40 whats with all the boxes, im scared for what the next video is gonna be
😂 this man is a freak’n savage
The Doug Demuro bit had me dying 🤣🤣🤣

Kkkkkk o executivos da Ferrari vendo esse video devem ficar putos
That was pretty cool.. everyone needs a Bubble
Lllmmmmfffffaaaaaaoooooo
Ready for the next merch drop! 🔥🔥🔥

You forgot the kitchen sink...
All I got to say is that your the man when it comes to getting everything out of any vehicle lol. But I couldn't do it. It's too nice of a car but I'm glad you can 😂
i thought they were only garage cars, really impressing
I’m more impressed with the balloon.
Lmmfao I don't know why but just the ending of it was just too damn funny
The Italian in me is so mad and confused. Please don't destroy that work of art, I don't think I can handle this one.
If Ferrari is smart they will just let this blow over.
Waiting for Mahindra or Tata car test ✌🏻
Thank you ever so kindly 🥰  We all know what F stands for in F-errori
it was not destroyed you lying fuck. I came here for destruction
We get two durability tests in one video and I really feel sorry for that gate
LoL, the barrage of shit being thrown had me Dying
Bro that car sound mean
The off-roading capability reminds me of how you can climb mountains with supercars in GTA V.
I never wanted one of these so bad until after watching you destroy one <3
This is fucking great! More plz!
Those are already out of stock!!
impressive, good quality content
Oh Mr. Whistlin, another amazing video.
Dudd has made more money than his fathers made farming, none of whistling videos has less than 1M views
You almost hit a HILUX with a lawsuit vehicle, be careful Cody
Im the kid who met your neighbor
YESSIR
haha just like a kid with ADHD playing with his toys!!
u FINALLY did it, u finally made me cringe and get mad at u, also this was the funneist thing EVER!!!!
The Muffin Pan was the best, on second thought why would he have a muffin pan
I want to see him trash a devel sixteen
This guy doesn't play Forza Horizon on Xbox. He does it in real life
Best video
You forgot to throw the kitchen sink at it
This hurts so bad, but I love it so much! Makes me cringe and smile at the same time
I did not want this video to end
Can u destroy a Tesla next
Dibs on the emblem you doodled on WhistlenDiesel that’s fair I called dibs!
I think Italy is going to invade you. Good luck!
When they started throwing everything at the bubble, that sent me 🤣
My fucking god, the dude is actually doing it. This is too good
watched kody and the gang for the longest time and just want the old content back😂 like sure its “high quality content” but i feel like its still getting away from whats expected… actual destruction and abuse of vehicles.
He lied about never clickbait ever, it isn’t destroyed😢
this is the best youtube channel lol
😂
Please buy a Toyota Land Cruiser to test!
I want to see him race the R8 vs Lamborghini vs Ferrari
That's all you got man you got soft on us I thought it would be convertible in 10 minutes
#OnlyWhistlingDieselCan pull this off and be able to get Ferackerie to go lay down, our common hero But #OnlyWestenChamplinCan put a diesel in it
Where was the kitchen sink? They threw everything else at it???
Some boy!
Legendary
Sorry I’m 35 mins late
Watch out. Ferrari might try and sue you for tarnishing their "good name" lol
I get he loves to piss people off and I love that about the guy but I wonder if he at all has any remorse with some of these 😂 like does it at all pain you?
America
Penis on the Ferrari logo = genius
Wow a whistling diesel approved car cover! They owe you some money!
00:37 “like a red rag to a bull” . . . :)
That's awesome 👍
I lost my absolute shit when you guys just started raining tools on it😂😂😂
It’s amazing seeing Cody going from old farm trucks to hyper cars. really shows that you can do anything in life if you put ur mind to it
Well, now we know Cody is a War Dog
Whoever makes that bubble needs to use this as a commercial
Yes please 🙏. Ferrari repoing cars just because they dont want people customizing they brand. Burn that shit to the ground.
Ferrari is sueing me :( They saw how much joy I had watching this video :(
Those dude better give u some money how good is that car cover lol
Bro wouldve got more views
Literally, children with too much money.  However, I love my Monstermaxx hoodie.
Yo that bubble is actually legit lol
congrats youtube you suggested a video from a fucking idiot that i blocked on the first video you ever suggested..... good code
The ending had me dead 💀
Predicted it I saw a video of him jumping on it on tiktok
Oh my God watching that video was like a train wreck I couldnt watch but i also couldn't stop watching lmao thanks for not killing it
That car is an off-road beast!
The sound of that car gets me hard asf
The grand finale was the best!!!
Normal wear and tear
I’m so glad you are doing this  I can’t wait to read all the comments
You gotta take it to a dealer for "Services"
When he wants to destroy it so bad so he buys a bubble to help himself from not 🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
took it too far when he brought up doug DuMero
didnt destroy it enough
Seriously impressed with that car bubble!!
Did something change his mind about getting the Bugatti and got this instead?. For a second I thought all the porches and Bently behind him were his
Forza IRL
I didn't know that this was a bubble durability test lmao
I thought 8t was supposed to be destroyed?? I was hoping for the good ol fashioned  use the escavator
Tunnel douche!
Great video dude.
Can someone give me a solid answer of how much will he make off this video. Cause I can't imagine him breaking even from this video.
I’m ready to see it burn. Set it on fire in the last video so I can watch everyone bitch and moan!!!!!
The bubble really impressed me. Congrats on your Ferrari
Coudllve gave it to me
11:45 hahahaha
you should start stacking all your destroyed cars till the stack is worth enough to buy a bugatti
Who else was waiting for kitchen sink??
#justacar
Chuck me a hammer! 🤣
I have missed you!  Jump the F8.
F**king hilarious. 😆 🤣
Just the dumbest shit pandering to 12 yos. I’m glad you’re making money but fuck man not sure I could look myself in the mirror being a professional idiot.
Yo guys can i get a hammer pls???😂
He drives this thing like it’s forza IRL
Omg, I'm expecting falcon X at this point! 30 guys throw at once!
i thought the next super car would have been a Bugatti, but this is still great!
DDE = Daily Driven Exotics WD: HOLD MY BEER
That’s it? We deserve better. A lot better. This was weak af.
I was hoping it get the same treatment as the GT-R
😂😅❤
glad i got here before ferrari tries to make youtube take it down
My guy!!  So good!! 😅😅😅
the bubble company should just use this as an ad. i know im sold
Oooooo we’ve been waiting for this one. I’m sure the worlds most prestigious automaker is gonna be aggravated with this😂
No way😂😂 he just bought a f*cking Ferrari just for doing that 😱 for sur I will see the next videos
You got to do a TRD Pro 4Runner. The Toyota fan boys will never forgive you.
🤣💀""give me a hammer"" 🔨🚧🏀🧹🔧🪜
Awwwwwweeee come on Cody!! What happened to you?!?!? Back then you didn't care?! DESTROY IT!! XD but who knows he might might a part 2 or 3 XD.
This is great advertising for the bubble thing.
Bro let the intrusive thoughts take over 💀
POV forza be like
That car bubble company gonna be sold out tonight LOL
I say you put mud tires on it
Hell yeah! Lmfao
Awesome video as always, loved the ending😂😂
Yikes...
So much pucker factor. But that's what makes whistlin diesel videos the best
Glad he talked about the suing stuff first off as that was what I was going to comment about
I know there is going to be some Karen or Kevin going to say something about this, but I fell that Cody is one of the few that deserves to do something like this. He grew up in Indiana, and it fucking boring here. I live in NW Indiana, not to far from Plymouth. The point being he grew up from nothing and now he’s able do to things like this, and make probably the best content on YouTube. Anyways Congrats on the Ferrari and the other 20 classic cars in the background that were not going to talk about.
man they must have been payed sooo much for that car bubble add 😂
It’s always a good day when whistlin diesel posts
I can invision you buying a house in california throw a gaint party, than get one of your monster trucks and destory it!!! Haha. Ooo so many people is gonna get livvid
Oh no
That was a great ad for the car bubble
Whats next monster-rari?😂
He better do the other video fast before he gets sued
Imagine being a Ferrari executive watching this
Next person to sue you is gey
I didn't know I needed to see WD waste a $400,000 car.
So when could you not do whatever you want with your own Sh*#? Best work boots and pickup truck reviews of 2023 so far!
So happy to watch this! My dream is to one day watch WD do this to a rocketship.
By far the best video on YouTube no doubt about it.
Where was the kitchen sink, haha
Cody..you need serious therapy..but..until then..Ill keep watchin!
I think I almost cracked my ribs from laughing so hard at that end of this video. Hilarious.
Blokes playing forza in real life
I hate loving you!
Definitely need a belly flop test for the bubble
I love the 30 seconds of chaos at the end 🤣
Considering how well the Ferrari did, they should use that as promo for how well built the Purosangue will be lol
It's like real life need 4 speed
My Kia has a blown transmission and I have $7 a day after payday. Some people are sad to see this. I’m not one of those people. Destroy that s.o.b.!
bobble no pop 🫢
Why did you do that to that beautiful masgestic beast 😢
A whole bunch of people just had a heart attack Italy.
This
Someone needs to show this to Jeremy Clarkson
Why are you sweating so bad?
2 wheel drive was nice let's see 4x4
I was waiting for this one and it didn't let me down
This is too hard to watch....
I’m so happy for you man, from the very beginning watching you put sawblade wheels on your Honda four wheeler to what you’re doing today. This worked out so well for you. It’s honestly so cool to see you come this far and make everyone so passed off. Keep killing em 💪🏻
Mike jumps a c8 Vette... A week later Cody is just like, wanna see me piss off the Ferrari legal team and half of the internet at the same time?
Dude is driving my House on wheels down a fu king gravel driveway 💀
I love how you’re rich but thrive off shit that makes other rich TRIGGERED.
Brother, I would love to have made it to your level. I know you’ve worked hard to be where you are but man at 50 years old and a soon to be Dad I would love to be in your shoes and have an awesome shop, a house and all the toys you get to play with. Good job sir.
Lol I am here for this content.
This dude is my idol. Bless
I needed the "give me a hammer" part 😂😂😂😂👌
If it's red it's dead !
I wish that Honda civic was mine
“ throw me a hammer “  barrage of hammers and such 😂😂
Just wait till he gets a lawsuit
Nice
he literally used the comment i posted on his over video omg lol
I couldn't help but giggle the entire video. The ending was perfection too.
Ultimate test would be a dicator's car. President's old transportation, etc.
Been waiting for this video for the longest time 😂. Impressive off-road car!!
I'm curious if anyone will still give you car insurance? Lol
FERRARI BAN HIM
This reminds me of driving up mountains in GTAV with supercars lmao
I couldn’t wait for this video. Thank you man I love you.
Beastly
Nice bubble
The next person to buy this car needs to be Ed Bolian @VINwiki because this car will definitely as he says "have a story".
I never get to see any hate comments how sad 😭 we need more haters 😂
waiting on when Ferrari ban the video from Youtube.
That’s the nastiest SxS I’ve ever seen
The end was hysterical. I was really hoping there would be one last little thing thrown and you didn’t disappoint.
Ferrari is gonna make sure you never get your hands on another Ferrari and if you do I would highly suggest never disclosing that person cause they’ll go after them as well
Real life Foriza Horizon 😂😂
🤣🤣🤣When he said “ohhh noo”🤣
MORE OF THIS!!! PLEASE !!! More supercars
I’m happy you didn’t f it up completely ahahah
that was fun to watch!
This video hurt my soul
lol dream car being smashed by a person who does not give a fuck what a flex
Playing GTA in real life 😂😂😂
Where the fuck do I get that car bubble holy shit
WhistlinDiesel: As we get these higher end vehicles, people are going to cry more😭
Best channel out there, I love Ferraris, but they deserve this 😂
Throw more shit at it. I’ve never laughed so hard. Thank you.
Let her eattttttt 😮
We can all agree that the gravel berm drift with the ferrari should be the thumbnail
Ferrari is gonna shit their pants
Love your content, I look forward to see some Ferrari chips if you know what I mean
Lol... Bugatti is not going to give him one of their cars I don't even know how he got this one But Bugatti??? If he gets one of Those cars to do this with Then it's true money Is all that really counts.. I always have wondered what the top speed in the bugatti is in reverse!!???😉😁
Me playing Forza:
I still would rather have my silverado
It looks random but Cody is absolutely genius.
I bin waiting. I just watched the Alaska car jump an I was like man this is missing one person an a exotic
bubble company stock going up!
Forza irl
This was hard to watch in a good way 😅
I need to see TaxtheRich     VS     Whistlindiesel
That was the absolute BEST last 1 min of any video out rn.
mr Ferrari can cry a river.... this is peak entertainment
Took it like a champ, No run it over with the bull dozer and see if it still drives 😏🫣
All im saying ford also has clauses for their gt, i would hate for you to get in trouble with them. 😉
The sound of wrenches being thrown across your garage floor sure brings back fond memories
Great video but I really wanted to see the durability test
Seems like it was cut a little short but that bubble I thought it was going to pop remember people if its red it's dead
I love this guys videos 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wow. The end was amazing
Well the hilux has a competitor
You sir are completely insane..... And I dig that about you!!!! Don't change for no one and keep them coming.🤯
LS swap it
We want part 2
Not gonna lie. This one hurt a little. That’s an awesome car or it was 😅😅😂😂
Absolutely one of the best videos, when I think the limits of lunacy has been reached you surpass it 😂👍✌️🇺🇲
FH4 in real life love this
you just play foza irl
What's going on with all the military box's I the background?
YOUR gonna have to sue the car bubble people when they use that Fuckin awesome pelting in THEIR commercial !👍👌💘 LOL 😂😂😂
That bubble is more harder to run through than a, Farmers daughter who goes to church every Monday, Wednesday and Sunday!
The Chinese car balloon sales are gonna go through the roof! Epic protection
My man be playing forza horizon irl
get a mclawren but turn it into a rock crawler
Im laughing so hard
I laughed all the way thru this! I noticed some nostalgia being thrown at the bubble, the small yellow sign that was at the farm. Pretty cool.
I am 100% guaranteeing this video is it’s going to get taken down
Lawsuit real soon W video though😂😂
I can't believe you would spend that much money on and then abuse the shit out of that poor bubble. China is going to sue.
What i do in forza when she won’t text me back
Ferrari owners- I never drive my car in the rain only on nice sunny days  Whistlin diesel- I wonder if I can climb this mountain
I will be curious to find out how long it takes for them to send you "the letter". It performed really good actually.
The SKB cases in the shop are a nice touch
This is why I'm subbed. To see someone smash the $h*t outta a Ferrari when the other YouTubers won't lol
I kinda understand how they don't want the brand to be ruined but it's kinda ridiculous
Can I have the scuderia shield for my mini cooper clubman s and I know that will make my mini cooper go faster.
Where can you get that bubble from?
Did I hear gunshots at 13:50 ? Is this a reference to the future upload?
CODY GIVE ME YOUR MONEY 💰 💵💰💵💰💵💰💵💰💵💰💵💰
God I love this channel
I still think you're a dick - but the "give me a hammer" bit was pretty funny
Reminds me of tax the rich! Jus with extra ultra violence
I can’t wait for the next episode
That think better actually die unlike the lambo.  REDD
I'm thinking she need wheel spacers and add paddle tires. Then snow, mud, river, sand dunes.....I trust you will make the right choice
Literally a advertisement for a car bubble 😭
Oh Boy...Maranello is gonna be on fire.
Blow it up for the haters lol
Bro ferrari is gonna blacklist you lmaooo. Love the video btw !!
Please do not hurt the viper that was at 4:12 😭
Was in tears of laughter from start to finish also amazed it done so well up dirt hills and in wet mud crazy
the bubble scene was fukkin comedy gold😂
This went well
Dude playing forza in real life
Shock facter getting old.   Better put some money in your bank.  Unsubscibed.
If it's red.......
This dude is playing gta in real life at this point
This is amazing
i will never like this video, but i will watch
I’ve ALWAYS wondered how much a Ferrari f8 could tow
Very impressed by the quality of that bubble.
Just realised the Huracán Evo cover lol
Italians: che palle
I call dibs on the racing seats after you destroy it 🤘🏼⚡@WhistlinDiesel
About time……
Did not know ferrari was this good in off-roading
Where tf do u get that bubble thing
I freaking love how you guys just started throwing all that shit at it!!!!😂😂😂
HE GIVE NO FUCKS.
Hell ya. Fuck ferrari!   I was'nt aware of the modding madness.   Ima keep my econoline now.
I’ve only seen the first five seconds of the video and I already love it…. LMFAOOOO
4:41 that look...🤣🤣
Ferrari is the soft underbelly of Europe!!!
Ok but you didn't throw the kitchen sink at it 🤦🏻‍♂️ definitely couldn't have stopped that
Threw everything but the kitchen sink at it.
This is great advertisement for Ferrari and that bubble protector!
It has finally been done
This entire video is just..........anxiety  😂
That was awesome! Like a real life forza driving over the hills haha
But how many bricks can it haul?
Bets on how long before the "Ferrari Sent Me A Cease & Desist" video is posted?
Lmao! 🤣 congrats on your first Ferrari 👏 as always, thanks bro!
Driving a tank over a Ferrari and a lambo
10/10 content gang
Omfg!!! Here we goooooo 😂😂
This is pure gold. The bubble was probably the most impressive part
By the end of the year we'll see "I bought a 6 million dollar Bugatti just to destroy it" 😂 I love these videos
To any Ferrari execs watching this.. this actually made me want an f8
This is awesome I can’t believe I’m watching this 😂😂
this whole video hurt my heart
This is why I love Cody because he doesn’t care what other people think
This was great 😂
Typical Ferrari dirver in Eastern Europ
Needs an angle kit for drifting 😂 Or, you know, just shorten the knuckles yourself.
Lmfaoo absolutely fucking yes!
Giving me old bam magera vibes
The only guy to buy a Ferrari and make the best add for a car bubble.
I have always wanted a Ferrari. But this will do for now.
Bro living GTA in Real life😂
This whole video was an advertisement for the car bubble company. That thing rocks.
Just epic 😂
u jus shitted on every youtuber
Bringing out the 288 GTO's supposed rally pedigree!
Cody, you are the greatest YouTuber in existence
Me playing forza horizon
😂😂😂
Honestly, coolest video so far. It fits the WD fleet.
Yeessssssss
The real question is. Is the bubble more durable than the Ferrari??
They provided better advertising for that bubble thing than the actual tiktok
Gold.
Sad face on the video What a beautiful vehicle ❤
That car rolls in and sees the other super cars and is like uh oh I'm in trouble 😳
Please
Great video. Always love your videos.
Guess I'm to old my first word was F50
they need a 4x4 offroad ferrari line now
I couldn't think of anything better to do with a $400k Ferrari. The way it is slanted down in the front reminds me of a ramp, so let's see you use it as a ramp to load your excavator onto a trailer. Now that would really show everyone how tough Ferraris are. lol.
this hurts my soul but I love it
Part 2.
That bubble is really fucking durable... Yes your probably going to get sued.
The ending was perfect
Makes me think of the wrench fight video…the good ol days
You and oompville should do a collab. You guys would be hilarious together lol!
Man is sweating bullets over the Ferrari 😂
I can't believe you didn't throw a kitchen sink at it. What kind of quality tester are you?
CEASE AND DESIST INCOMING
Give it time, OEMs will be giving him prototype vehicles to test. They may as well get on board..
Now will the bubble stop a bullet LOL
The first car and The first time I think he has gone to far… and I love it..
CANT WATCH YOU DESTROY THIS CAR THIS DOESN'T MAKE YOU COOL
I can’t watch something so heinous and grim . I only made it 1 min thru - I work for Ferrari of bel air
What's in the boxes Cody?
This is exactly how I drive my Ferrari in Forza
Glorious advert for the China Spy Balloon Car Protection System
Could you pull me into town later?
This new Forza DLC is NUTSSS.
Wow that's a cool fast car.  Lol
One of the greatest things I've ever watched!!
Hes going to a store and park and people will take pictures of the car and he's be walking around looking like a homeless man and like try to say its there car and than he pulls out the keys
Can't wait to see the this thing after a lift and some mud tires
Daily Driven Exotics needs to buy it right before it’s fully totaled
Coming soon "On this episode of Vinwiki I bought the most abused Ferrari on earth"
Can't wait for the c&d video
They can’t sue you if they can’t catch you.
Been here from the beginning, and I’ll be here for the Bugatti durability test.  Petition needed for Cody to durability test products from companies.
So do you get around the lawsuit on your own property or do you just pay the cease and desist
Streetspeed 717: “Watch me jump my c8!”  Whistlin Diesel: “Hold my beer.”
Please God shred it like a squated truck
Yoo WD Rev it for 5 - 10 minutes something cool will happen
Forget the Ferrari, that Fiji water came from Japan! How dare you!
This is the best advertising for that bubble I’ve ever seen
Whistlindiesel is the one guy I love lmao
cool off road vehicle
What is in the boxes Cody?
14:11 best scene of a whistlindiesel video!
I like to see all cars and trucks put to there full potential
That sounds really good for a turbo Ferrari
Shelby swap it. That might make ‘em mad lol
You are amazing and crazy at the same time Ferrari is going to cry 😢😂😂😂😂👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
ferrari can't sue him if they cant see him with camo
The hood would work great for a shitter!
what
Dude bring this to the dunes
You probably just sold thousands of those bubble car things.
Next The Bugatti 🎉❤😂
GTA V when you get enough money to buy a sports car.
Best 1
Feels like forever!!!!
Why are you such an idiot with your car?
Best Sunday ever
Forza horizon in real life
All them totes full of merch or WW3 🤔👀😶‍🌫️
I don’t think he cares about the paint
I love how that car means nothing to you... I have multiple sclerosis, I've become disabled and I never even have the chance to get a car like that anymore, and while it means nothing to you, and it would mean everything to me, I still get enjoyment over watching what you have planned for that car good or bad.
Fatherless behavior.
I've been working at a body shop for a bit now and extra tips I learned was if you're painting the door, it's better to take off the mirror and belt molding (the trim at the bottom of the window) for a better paint job in the end. The mirror can get in the way, and if you're unlucky, the clear coat could stick in that gap between the door and the belt molding
8:17 me in forza trying to get 3 starts on those jump things
Remember seeing you asking about military cargo storage crates, they look right at place in the garage
Right when I think he can’t out do himself had a smile the whole video the goat for real
This looks like irl Forza Horizon
Using all of his girl friends only fans money to fund this stupid shit lol
Hilarious 😂 😂
YOOOOOO
How big of plow can it pull? A good Italian horse should pull a plow no problem.
Ok last comment did you drive through that wall lol is that why there's all those case's lol mr durability👊
The bubble 😂
Boys living forza in real life.
Mad man 😂😂 love it
Can’t wait to see it gets destroyed
Amazing lol
Ferrari have some problems for real,  imagine you can't modify or change your car because u are gonna get sued bruh
This guy is an idiot
This is the DDE spirit
in the past it was sad seeing you destroy some specific cars but this one i enjoy with an evil smile
As the local Ferrari club members would like you to know depending your nationality you my friend are a total  disgusting an how you see yourself depending the situation a total twit or twat  you choose. We have sent your picture to every club an you will be denied entry an further more you are no longer allowed to wear polo shirts nor witness a polo match for you my friend are truly not the Ferrari caliber an further more to disgrace the Ferrari symbol by putting a gender on it is grounds for repossession  .you are truly not idiot enough to own such a fine pos .you must lower your standards before our Ferrari club reconsiders your company in our worthless presence.
That gimmie a hammer ending was epic!
Farreri, huracan evo cover, these first 5 seconds you are gonna get sued, they will try lol
Voor de Nederlandse kijkers is die foto van die kapotte Ferarri in nederland wel lachen iedereen kent de video
I'd like to believe that the costume and cases were tarkov references
this thing needs to be lifted
Imma just say it man. He used to be funny and entertaining now it's just. "Look at me break this expensive thing ... Waaaaa 😭😭😭 It's my stuffffff I can do what I wannnttttt" it's just not even funny anymore
TOP G
What ever floats your boat..
Throw me a hammer! LMAO!! I love this guy!
Forza IRL be like…
It's like Forza Horizon IRL
Might've voided the warranty on this one.
And I thought streetspeed was outta hand for taking the c8 off road lol poor car!
Uses his lambo to film his Ferrari 🤣🤣 boy his daddy is rich!!!
In for Arfcom meltdown. Keep it up!
🤣😂😅😀🤣😂💯
You should put Subaru badges on it and rally it
I LOVE IT WHISTLENDICKS LOL
yes!!
"Contrary to popular belief, i actually care about my cars. Especially the red ones." Yes
buy a c7 corvette for your next "durability" test. lol
Yes In the rain up the driveway was awesome!!!
Cody just created the best advertisement for that car bubble
The Lambo cover lol
This guy has next level autism
A bigfoot hunter sees a red ferrari in the woods and nobody believed him
my dream is to drive a ferrari and jump it that be awesome
This is the place to be
Mike jumps a C8! Cody: Hold my beer!!
WD playing Forza Horizon irl and I'm all for it.
I gotta admit, if you were to ask me what’s the one thing you would do to have fun if you were a billionaire, I would probably say go off-roading in supercars
That was actually pretty impressive how it handled all that
Love it 😂
eh Lamborghini is better anyway
Mans just got money bruh.
Bro woke up and chose violence
Car enthusiasts die when they see your vids
The causal neglect of the Merc and Lamborghini 🤣🤣  From Big Reds to Ferraris what a ride!!
The destructive testing is way more fun to watch than just destruction, I’m excited to see what comes further
Lamborghini car cover.
When you're done destroying this, make sure you take the motor out and put it in your gtr or hilux lol
Link to that car cover please
Little disappointed no damage taken but the bubble had me dying
lmao forza horizon 4 when your looking for that barn find :'D 7:43
zzzzzzz😔
These videos were very fun and cool but now thats all you been doing.  You seem bored. You are no longer the only guy on youtube destroying supercars.  Let's get back to you old content that brought us here.
More Car Cover Reviews Diesel .
Whistlindiesel is literally playing forza horizon in real life
Finally
Its like a millionares retardex playground. I love it.
@whistlindiesel - I haven’t watched the whole video yet, however… Um, if only you tested your Audi the same way.    It’s coming up to a brand with a bias. Or I’ll see after I finish this.
41k views in 20 minutes ⚡🤘🏼
That new tractor you have just acquired is very stout! I was hoping you would show us all how well it integrates with the bucket attachment or the log splitter. Fantastic utilization of the red implements
We make a rugged, sleek, off-road super car. (you can tell by the full undercarriage skid plates)
How long do you think until Ferrari executives get ahold of this a start flipping tables.
You should go to a drag strip and race the lambo
Hahaha freakin love it
Out handled expectations.. Out handled potential abuse.. Out handled weather.. Impeccable
i love this man with all of my heart :D
Sheeeeeesh. To be honest, a lifted Ferrari wouldn't even look bad
Everyone send this to Ferrari.
What the hell is in all the pelican cases ??
First word ”Fire.”
Deadmau5 punching the air rn
That ending was epic 👏 A+
My car in the shop right now and I can’t even afford the repairs …
Everything but the kitchen sink thrown at it.🤣
Why haven't WD and Wildcat collabed? Keller be all up in both their videos all the time, clearly they're connected 😭
TaxTheRich would be proud
this was a soft durability test.
Broo funniest video on YouTube of all 2023!!!❤🎉
Wait, was that meme cut away Garrett Ginner ?
The old editing style is wonders my man😂😂
Hell yea bro!! Tear it up!!! I have a customer that drives his Ferrari in his orchard to bring me parts lol😂
🍿🍿
Bros literally playing forza irl
First thing I think when I hear Ferrari is "entitled pompous prick"... I can't wait for you to trash it!!! #IfItsRedItsDead
Ahh here we go again🤘🇺🇸😂
Way better than Mr. Beast.
This just made streetspeed 717's c8 offroad video obsolete
This is a nice budget off-road car
Me in Forza Horizon
i was nervous the whole time
It looks like gta5 in real life.. how you got an exotic car going in the mountains with a random suit on lol
Where’s the distruction
Tax the rich on steroids!
probably the best ad for that car bubble the world will ever see
This is great!
This guy's trying to hard to be like Emilia Farthard
Ferrari is going to come for this man's head
Do a blindfold paint job 🤔  to get rid of that horrible red that on there 🤔 💯 💶 💯
I was watching and talking at my self all the time
whistlin zelensky
Car bubble is legit!!
Ferrari wanted level was funny asf
“hey give me a hammer”, at least you got a hammer.
How does he have so much money he can fuq around in a 400k car
Golden
Absolute mad man. The ending with all the random shiy flying at the car for like 2 minutes straight had me cracking up
Where's the 24" lift so you can step on the ferrari to get into Monster Max?
I love him so much for content like this 😂❤
The ending 💀💀
COMPLETE AN ABSOLUTE FUCKWIT HOPE AFTER THIS NO CUNT EVER SELLS YOU'RE DUMBARSE ANOTHER CAR AGAIN
I had to eat plain bread yesterday
Let me get that ferrari compressor please!!!!
dude is a legend
Can't say I don't hate to see it lol. Always wanted a Ferrari 488 GTB. One day I'll have one lol. Beautiful car Cody :P
That final shot was amazing
This vid was a work of pure genius and somehow the most satisfying to me than all others before it! Keep up the amazing debauchery!💯👍
the last one with the bubble is one of your best, my opinion. ;)
that was probably the most fun video to make lmfaooo that thing rips offroad haha
Bruh. You didn’t even destroy it!
Didn’t expect this to turn out to be a bubble durability test. But it passes.
the first time i ended up here was bcs a truck with square wheels now hes doing this. how the turntables
the lamborghini cover 💀
I am so disappointed. You threw everything at it but a kitchen sink. lol.
WhistlinDiesel should make a video with cboystv.
I wonder if we will see the return of..... "If it's red, it's dead"
Bro WTF???😭😭😭 LOOK man I love ya but this is pushing it! Yeah I seriously want to cry at this point.. Usually I'm all 4 watching you f****** your own s*** what do I care It's not mine But this this is Heartbreaking! I cheered on the Audi I laughed my a** off over the lambo! But that Ferrari Ah f*** it punch it!!🤜🏼🏎💨💨💨💨💨🩷😷🤣😂🤣🤣
From a dumbass chevy boy to dumbass Ferrari boi....what a fuggin progression.
Yolo
GNAG
I know he wont read this but Cody's videos ALWAYS manage to make me smile and feel just a little bit better! Thank you Cody!
One trick pony here.  Buy something.  Destroy it.  Repeat.
The only bad part of this video is the fact that there’s only 1 Ferrari
So based
13:57 I just knew they were bound to throw a d1ldo. That last part was the best.
Within the first 2 secs of the video I knew I was gunna love it.
Congrats on the car, I'm glad its red!
Lol 😂
More of an ad for the bubble than anything else
Please enter this into a rally cross event.
Ferrari rn:😭
That’s actually really impressive
This video gave me cancer!
Bros driving like he’s on forza, what a man 😂
Yes just yes, someone's feathers gonna be rustled up.
Buy a koniseg and do a durability test it is the power of sweden
IM DEAD
History has been made Again
I remember DDE with lambos in winter was a big deal back in the day... that's nothing compared to this lol
Cease and desist incoming lol
Ferrari owners be like:😇 Cody: 🛠️
This is what I do in GTA
I'll give you $20 for it.
Love that fact you spend $400000 on a Ferrari just to send it!!!!.
Surprised Bugatti didn't do it to you, they banned actors for not being able to open the doors properly 😂😂
No kitchen sink? Clearly its not a well tested bubble
That was badass
Worth the wait!  This was awesome
He never ever disappoints!!
Can i have the ferrari :D
I HaTe YoU WhIsTlInDiEsEl! >>>:::ccccc
Do I see some high grade ferrari mulch incoming soon? Or will a YouTube channel buy it to "restore" 🤔
jesus christ
CODY!   I.... I.... Well I'm Italian American so please take what I say here seriously... I love to see you finally made it in life to buy a vehicle that will always be a dream of mine to own.    And with that said please know I am in tears right now.... Tears Of JOY!!  I am so happy to see how well us Italians can build a vehicle!  Please keep up this amazing work and showing us how durable these high end vehicles are.   Many of us will never be able to find out for ourselves so it's good to see there are people out there willing to push these vehicles to the limit.    God Speed my Friend.
Cute!
The joy of having more money than sense, and no f#cks to give 😂
Oh no it’s red (that’s the first thing I said when I saw  the vid)
Hey the good news it's not wracked and it's in one piece YAY!
I just need the bubble wrap thing trash the car
What's in all those cases?
Yea he's screwed
Please destroy that Italian trash!!!
please stop, your wasting money, and natural resources.
how long till this gets taken down?
sup
The ending is FAF!!!
My man lmao 🤣
he couldn’t get the 8 million dollar bugatti, so he settled with the 400 thousand dollar ferrari 😂
Much cooler car than Daddy Doug's CGT
This is the best shit ever.
This mans the next Ken Block
They were meant for it.
*TAKE IT TO THE DRIVE THRU CAR WASH PLEASE*
Someone made a whistlindiesel proof cover for cars 😦😦😦
The best YouTube video ever!!!
Man I’m so damn jealous I’d love to have that car let me have it when your done. A broken Ferrari better then no Ferrari
The sound of the F8 💦
iM STILL WAITING FOR YOUR TANK!!!
Welp better watch this before it gets yeeted   I never heard anything about Ferrari hating people using their cars
Definitely needs some all seasons or all terrain tires
A man who has always been true to his word, destroys cars he says he will, uploads daily and loves his fans dearly.
Wow can't wait for part 2.... That look like the most fun drive in the world, I'm jealous.
Take it Deer hunting
How many ladders does this guy have lmaoo
I love this video. Making all the Ferrari lovers cry.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Looks legal to me other than maybe the road drifts on camera but that Ferrari did off-road quite acceptingly well.
I just wanted to say, thanks for all of your content and even if there are gaps, way to keep it fresh!
bro is like taxtherich but to the extreme
Ik you wont see this comment, but it feels good to still get it out there... I used to watch every single one of your videos the day they came out, but ever since the R32s, you have just been destroying shit to piss people off, and to shit on the "haters". I will always miss the old whistlindiesel, you just turned into another youtube jackass now
Bro I don’t even think that hood scoop bend, is a safety feature hahaha
Good thing you have lawsuit insurance
Looks legal to me other than maybe the road drifts on camera but that Ferrari did off-road quite acceptingly well.
i dont know whats better, the car or that bubble?! impressive!
Síiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Let’s gooooo
Totally amazing nothing else to say
Bro the ending 😂😂😂😂😂
Befor i watch this.  I just want to say.... LOL that was awesome
You know you're early when you see a bunch of bots posting "legitimate" comments. Anyhoo, I'm surprised the G Wagen is still alive. Are we saving it for a Whistlindiesel version of "Top Gear: The Battle of Overpriced and Overhyped European Cars"?
Bongo longo wongo dongo…il watch the video later 1:04
No one questions the 150 military cases in the background?
This car has no idea on whats about to happen.
Man’s literally playing forza
That off-road capacity is pretty impressive, I think it would be nice to take it to the next level
Looks like just about the most fun you could have with 400k!
congrats cody! do whatever your American heart desires with that vehicle. Fuck ferrari. Sincerely, an italian guy
VINWIKI aint got NOTHING compared to this automotive channel...
Damn nice tax write off ya got there. try to actually enjoy this one a little longer before you turn it into more than one piece. and Smoke em if you got em little ferrari things are about to get painful.
why?
When you talked about how the Corvette C8 is in clay form from the Ferrari, that's a bit true. Idk why GM would do that when it doesn't even make proper horsepower. I'm already laughing hard that they screwed up the new Corvettes like they do everything.  EDIT: I kinda went overboard with my comment, I actually like the newer Corvettes and older GM products.
You the hero we need, but don't deserve.
Wonder how stupid the guy from Instagram feels that was all upset you were wearing camo.🤣😂🤣
yoooooo
Your videos are great. Been waiting on this one for a while. You should durability test the Nissan hardbody you had next to the hilux’s in one of you videos. That would be gold.
Haha :) Rubbing that horse was naughy !
Oh man I was sad when it started , but I’ve come around 😂
Good test on the car bubble. I'm buying one now. Lol
Can you please get a rolls rois to distroy please
Threw everything but the kitchen sink 😉
Awesome 👌
This man hasn't let the money and clout change him one bit, he just uses it to destroy more expensive things and I'm so here for it
deserved
WD got me like 😬😬😬😬🤣
You people are very crazy
I want to see the stress test 😈
I hope that's a $20k kit car
Certified race car driver
I love this man
Dude said. Forza horizon and bought a Ferrari from the menu.
Cody to be honest I wouldn’t mind if you decide not to totally destroy it, the fun and pain are pretty much equal, but we shall not love material stuff. So go for it man, kill it as if it was a squatted shit box.
Mother of God.
i love this guy
Throws everything at it but the kitchen sink!……….
Hahahahahahahahha.  Screw ferrari and their nonsense lawsuits.
Very satisfying outro   i dont know what else to say
What are all of those boxes ? 11:40
Every kids dream 💭
The red is so pretty 😍 awesome vid
You forgot the kitchen sink
Turn it into a rally car
Holly shit I can't stop laughing
I love this guy LoL he should be named mrbeast
14:03 "we'll send someone to clean that up" *WE'RE THE ONES THAT GOTTA CLEAN THAT UP*
Love the Lamborghini cover on it!
Forza IRL
Sheesh
No one even talking about all the cars in the back
The Maker of that bubble needs a pat on the back, I think we need a whole series on bubble durability test
Its like me on forza horizon 4
These cars have very bad build quality.
Eargasmic
Can i get what is left of that Ferrari...Im crying
This is great
Mans playing forza horizon

😂🇺🇸🏁
Was waiting anxiously to watch this one. Did not disappoint 🔥
Yes dude ! It’s your money you do what you want with it !
Ferrari is going to your house right now with grenade launchers
Turns out the car was bought by the car balloon sponsor.
You brought a ferrari, will you destroy it or keep it? It cost lots of money!
Should have started the video play horizon then getting in the car and start going nuts
bet he wouldn't destroy a rolls Royce
Costly Destruction
Driving the rarri like a damn go-kart
🔥🔥🔥
Thank you for doing this video brother! Ferrari needs more of this.
I thought Keller worked for wildcat 😂  much love WD!
I fucking love you man, you do everything people do in videogames.. but in real life. I actually waited for this to happen for a long ass time
Sales of the car bubble 📈📈📈
Playing gta 5 reallife

Sick and wicked, love it
The only crime here is I can only like this video once.
Omg I can’t wait for pt2

Does not disappoint 😆
Laughing my ass off while watching this video. Thanks whistlin diesel. Keep it up

If it’s Red it’s ___
It honestly hill climbed pretty well! also that air bubble contraption works way better than i thought it would too lol
You forgot to throw a car at it
lmao "driver warning" "you could get sued"
I wanna see this drive through the garage door😂😂
This makes me realize how much money this legend actually has
I’ve been waiting for this sir, we need you at the next Keller meet
This makes me realize how much money this legend actually has
Oh boy this is painful

All a F8 is a 488 with a bodykit
To short of a vid lol
@ferrari
Last 50 seconds 😂
Who knew Ferrari made sick offroad hill climbing vehicles. 😆
That should be a commercial for the bubble😭😭
Like for Koenigsegg durability test
Let's hope he doesn't get sued by Ferrari like how they usually do
That right there is simply redneck science that’s all Ferrari can suck stallion dick.
Nice car but it NEEDS BIG TIRES AND A LIFT KIT
That’s it
Neutral drop it
You should race Cleetus's porsche
If you gonna destroy it please make it useful by doing durability tests just like the hilux.
Monday morning at Ferrari HQ. "Should we go after him, or will it backfire?"
Slowly working up to a buggatto
Top it out first   This is control insanity The logic is unstoppable reverse psychology
Porsche next??👀👀
Oh dear. Lets see what Ferrari does here.
GOOOOAAAAAAT
I've been waiting on someone to take a ferrari off road for years, I am one happy man seeing this happen, I can't wait to see the rest of this
oh yeah this was a good'in
WD doing his part to reduce carbon existing and prevent climate change. Way to go, man! Wait, what? Carbon *Emissions* are the problem? Oh. Well, fu©k that! Increase them!
car enthusist:You need to take care and not drive hour ferrari much  cody: 7:32
The military equipment worth 3 billion us dollars in the back:              👁👄👁
That won’t be hard…they destroy themselves bc junk
Bro plays with his Ferrari like it is forza.

Ferrari deserved every bit of this for the stuff they do to customers XD
1:53 I’ve always imagined me  grabbing that section of buttons and pull it off with all my strength and see how it goes. 😂
Let’s  Go Brandon  😂🎉
Ahhhhhhhhhhh🎉😂❤

13:29 great advertisement for that bubble company
Coolest trail cam pics EVER!
That is one expensive way to get content and views....... Somehow it works for you.....  I think I might have to set one of my motorcycles on fire........ If I get 1 million subscribers 🤔 I will let one blow up and it will burn 🤣😂🤣😂
Using a Ferrari F8 as a gokart😂😂😂
The driving talent reminds Dominic Torettome of Fast and Furious.
Ppl at Ferrari were like….. “he wasn’t that rough on her thank god”… 😂😂😂
Always garage kept, always been babied, senior owned.
liked the video before even watching
If it’s red… it’s de…
I didn't see no Kitchen sink
Dude video isn't getting many views oh no
I've never been more excited to hear  "oh no" in my life!!! 🤣
I swear the F8 looks like a kit car gone wrong, I love ferrari, I really do but these are hideous, have fun Cody.
Yes
this video is a work of art
That was the funniest way to end the video HAHAHAHAHA i loved it and cant wait to see the haterz reactions and all the butt hurt over people trying to tell others how and what to do with their money
i love how funny it is when i see how people get mad when he destroys a shit box square body but it a 400,000 thousand dollar sports car people cheer him on
saw your instagram story of this vid going live and now i’m pulled over on the side of the road watching this
didn’t really “destroy” it though did you? bit clickbait if you ask me
I’ve been waiting even though I didn’t know what I was waiting for. It was worth it.
I would love to do what you do Cody, your videos are hilarious to watch. Nothing maters more in this work than some great laughs and family. Keep up what you do.
51k views in 24 mins damn!
Hate to be the person who had to clean up after the end 😂

The Doug Demuro cameo had me dead 💀
Does no one see he can get a cease and desist from Ferrari and can get sued
Nice orange tan. LMAO!
Forza horizons in real life. Nice.

That’s fucking awesome 😂
Freakin sweet😂😂😂
Waiting on the day a Bugatti becomes the car climbing that hill 😂
yooo.. if that is possible to put a Ferrari engine to one of your trucks for off-road. it must have a lot of power output. 😎
Just a low key AD for the protection bubble....lol
Wouldn't be funny if Ferrari sent Cody another one to do  testing on🤣🤣🤣
Yes
Must've been fun ASF 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
RED OR DEAD
My mans madder than a box of frogs
I’m not even mad. I’m just jealous 😂
Hey bro love your stuff, Thats crazy. I am a disabled veteran and cant even afford a regular car to not destroy lol

looooool fuck ferrari! very cool to see this
Damn that bubbles stock just went through the roof
Shred that fkr
Maybe you should’ve waited for the upcoming Ferrari SUV Purosangue.
Watching this gave me the same feeling as watching another man get kicked between the legs.  😅
I love the fact that a car company in Italy would try to tell whistlin diesel that he can't drive a car he owns on his own property!
Video was weak asf
Meme potential right there, " Give me the Hammer "   *Proceeds to throw random stuff*
The ending split my gut    Omg I'm showing my mom this one.  Hey throw me a hammer is the new meme punch line on tik tok you watch
legendary
Streetspeed jumps a C8 and Whistlin Diesel buys a F8 to rally😆
bruh i asked for the hammer not the shed lmao
Dude my dad has the same one he lets me ride in I love Furawri haha
Ferrari right now:  👁👄👁
That's got to be the funniest shit I have ever watched
Legit real life gta with the army uniform and driving in the dirt / doing donuts so awesome bro 😂😂😭
Pretty cool to see it get up that hill pretty easily actually
He is gonna get sued for talking about getting sued
“Im assuming that can get wet”
It’s red…it’s dead. Sounds so good! Crazy watching a Ferrari off-road.
Fire video 🔥

Nice Corvette
The gunshots in the ending 🤣🤣
Who else was waiting for the kitchen sink to be thrown at it🤔
We are reaching atomic levels of Whistlin diesel
fantastic outro lol
Hmm..you have a problem with Red .lol.  just like the Away Team Members in original Star Trek. Will the Ferrari take a set of 40 Tires for Mud Bogging?
WD always takes care of his cars
Other than get stuck I didn't see it do anything my YJ couldn't do. And don't come at me with looks because beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Next video you should buy a John Deere tractor and make a video fixing it lol
taxtherich2.0
Good job. Great job. Excellent job. Amazing job. Fantastic job.
Dadd
This used to be only something you would see in forza
I thought I was watching the new Forza game
the ending 😂😂 you didn’t go through enough trees good shit tho fr man has the balls to fuck with ferrari
Bro's living in a dream
Babe wake up whislindiesel posted a new video!!
That ending was amazing and should be the advertisement for that bubble company
I went to buy a Bugatti but all I got was this lousy Ferrari 😢
I don't care what anyone says WhistlinDiesel deserves everything he's worked for ⚡🏁 Let's get him to 10 Million so we can see the Bugatti durability test
I  need real ferarri rally racing now, that sht is so good
Couldn’t wait lol

Amazing..well done
This is hard to watch. Just dumb, send the car to me. I'll take care of it
Oh fuck
Red car in Ohio...😬
How can anyone hate? He's put his time in to afford to do shit like this. Congrats on the new F8! Can't wait to see what new vehicle you get next. Koenigsegg or Pagani hopefully
Your just a low life but I like your life but if I could see you mudding the Ferrari then we will be cool but other then that tell all your followers to eat a dick
Ferrari can learn a lot from this durability test
This is awesome 👏
I swear I don't get your YouTube notifications anymore.
What do you get when you have too much money and not enough common sense. This
good advertisement for the car balloon tbh
Blow it up loser
You have to do a video with DDE at least one time!!! That would be awesome!!
Bro gave the car bubble the biggest free advertisement ever
Let’s gooooooo ❤
They should be impressed on the durability and use this in a commercial
My new life goal is have friends to throw stuff into a plastic bubble thing with a Ferrari in it 🏆 This video was so good 😂
I was already in bed, (It's Sunday night in Portugal) I just got a notification that WD posted a video. Got up and came to watch it on my PC. Good video, keep it up. Good night!
this is me with my super cars in gta 5 on mount chiliad
Wow, totally impressed how well she handled off road… wonder if it can jump?

🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’m sure I’m not the only one that put their hand to their head the moment he started throwing the water bottle through the front air damn or just treating it like a two-year-old child
I had forgot about the red car “thing” 😮😮😮😂😂😂
Thank you, best upload yet! 🔥
No way this is awesome
Why not test out a corvette bought in America
mans playing real life forza lmfao
Why did that bubble thing low key work 😂😂
The absolute GOAT of YouTube
I bet rich snooty people hate this guy 😂😂😂😂

hey, you'll test a tesla someday?
13:17 seeing all the random things getting thrown at the ferrari is funny af💀
DOUG
Never buy a used car from WD
Was anyone else waiting to see the rpg fly at the ferrari

6:01 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
And we expect nothing less from you .
All this time I thought I needed an SUV or a truck,, I need a Ferrari 😂
You are my Idol!
Sick car brother have fun with it 😅for everyone if he trashes the car he is more than allowed to IF HE IS NOT THE FIRST OWNER when you buy A said Ferrari from the Ferrari dealership there's a contract that they have with you is insane rules you got to apply by they could said seized vehicle and many other ridiculous things but if you're the second or third or any owner after the first that contract actually no longer applies to said owner
Ferrari is gonna have Nightmares about Cody now
Bravely going where literally no car has been before. Lmao.
Your the King....of ohhhhh shittt
This is great content
I was smiling the whole time
Ferrari gon be on yo ass 😭

My BMW X1 is 💩 I've spent more on repairs than it cost me. I wish you could "work" on it for me. It's so upsetting. Please fix my car.
whisling diesel be like "i hope i dont get sued" 😆🤣
9:40 literal video game clip
"Ferrari Wanted level...."
Can't wait for the Bugatti
13:16 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Had to click it as soon as possible before it was taken down for some sensitive reason
Dude I lost my shit when they all started throwing random things at the car while it was in the bubble 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Rare footage of me on forza
Love it
Forza horizon irl

I F LOVE iT 😂😂😂
Well shit 😂😂
13:16 I literally died laughing at this part 💀💀💀
Hey throw me a hammer
Deep down inside he actually cares about this one
How did it not pop at the end
I think all these car makers should hire whistlindiesel to do commercials for their car brands. Remember, back in the day, the old Chevy commercials were they would pull down houses and go mudding in the commercials, lol. Show the durability of these cars its genius what he is doing.
Ferrari watching this 👁👁
Here before the lawyers
I think the chinese spy balloons could take a lesson from that bubble
Ferrari cease and desist is on speed dial😭
Forza looks dumb real nowadays
yo… thats a lotta cases
Kinda want to see this done to an AMG GT but idk if I could stomach it 😂
😂😂😂😂Haha
I WAS WAITING TO SEE A *KITCHEN SINK* THROWN!!! 😭🤣🤙🤘
If you want to give the car away I will gladly take it 😅😢
I literally was half way through my shower when I got this notification, I had to click instantly.... now I have dried up shampoo in my hair... but its worth it
i thought he woulda bought a vinal wrap so it wont be red lmao
Throwing every tool and object in the warehouse at the Ferrari is a great touch

This is by far the craziest thing you’ve done
Everything i do in forza now irl. So sick

Cody out here playing forza in real life 😂
I'm so happy that this guy is basically putting a massive middle finger to all those fanboys
Merci Forever Forza

Does anyone know where is Jason? He has been gone since cave inspection video.
Best video ever
Supremely disappointed with the absolute lack of destruction. Sickening. Money has changed you.
"Give me a hammer" 🤣🤣🤣

I feel like you have to try to get a cease and desist from Ferrari, you can frame it and hang it up on your wall like an award
😂😂😂
Destroy expenses things fetish

Never misses to make me laugh. The end classic
You might be onto something off-road Ferrari racing 😂

why’s it actually look so good muddy af
Nice!!!
advertisement for the car bubble
This is going to be the pinnacle of why WD loves red cars
i love this man please invite alex choi for a video i’d be so happy
Lmfao 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 oh my God You're about to piss a lot of people off This is going to be extremely funny! I am sure nobody's ever driven a Ferrari like you're about to
Excited to see this, its been a long way since the Blue F-350 video
I love how he cares for the toyotas more than the Ferrari literary would do the same with that kind of money
I can't with the ending 😭 🤣
This should become a Ferrari commercial, I mean come on! That off-road capability is incredible
When this video popped up im sure alarm bells ringed in Italy.
Based, f*ck Ferrari. Most overrated carmaker by far.
do this in italy
I'm surprised they let you buy a red one and didn't already have you black listed 🤣
Mans driving like when you are first handed the controller in forza horizon 5 :). Peak comedy.
You won’t do itttt 😈
You should contact Edwin Sarkissian and shoot it with his guns on his YouTube channel! 50 bmg vs Ferrari
Lmao the ending to funny 😆
I Dream of being this level of rich.
Finally uploads Ferrari vid, day is made
Oh my gosh, I've got tears in my eyes I'm laughing so hard!
Make this the top liked comment for no reason 😂
Such a great video. Looking foward to more videos 😁👍
My man’s gonna get permanently banned from owning a ferrari
I am seriously impressed by the hill climb and the off roading capabilities so far This series is going too goo crazy and kinda interested in seeing how Ferrari reacts too tbh
Part of me is pissed off at this because who the fuck wouldn't want a Ferrari right? The rest of me is just laughing because it's fuckin hilarious.
I have to admit....that plastic bubble was far more robust and durable than I would have expected. That's at least 6.5/10 prolapsed rectums.
The Ferrari lawyers are getting ready after watching this video
next video title, “addressing the lawsuit.”
Dude I wanna drive my lifted Mazda on it 😈 if it's red it's dead
When you won the last car in hill climb racing
A inspiration for all
Will anyone reply to this comment or like it?
the endless attack on the car tent 😭
If you are selling jars of ferrari i will buy 16 oz of your legal trouble immediately
*ferrari sues cody* Cody says okay... *Cody buys more ferraris*
I like that way he is taking apart everything 😂😂😂
ohh he just created a pee pee of horse on ferrari ☠️
C'mon Cody, you gotta do a ferris buler skit in a video with this thing.
what Whistlin said - This is what I waer on the Property  what I heard - this is what I wear into Factory  I relate more to what I heard
Ferrari legal is losing their minds right about now 😂
Brilliant mate. Sad that there wont be a part two though, Ferrari is gonna be on Kody's ass.
Hahahahahahahaha the end 😭
LET’S GO! 🎉
Will there be a part two?
I hate red cars but that thing is beautiful.
He has a lot of ladders.
The amount of stuff he threw at the bubble around the Ferrari 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 love it WD
bruh lol
i am impressed you even made it last 1 episode LOL
What color is your farrari??  😂
ooooo this outta be good !!!!!!!!!!!! lol
loved the video, keep it up❤
Never disappoints.
Ferrari is going to be PISSED
Forza horizon in real life
Everything flying at the bubble took me back to the wrench fight in the shop
I should have invited people over to watch this instead of superbowl. Way more entertaining.
Ohh man I've always been a fan you and always will be but damn, this actually hurts something inside of me I didn't even know I had...
so glad you did an exhaust first, i think it made the entire video even better
Crazy that the car is still alive
Hhahaha love it
When all the stuff was getting thrown at it was really hoping there was going to be a kitchen sink he gave it his all except the kitchen sink
#RELEASETHEDIESELCUT I demand more
Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!! W.D.
Man they really improved the graphics in gta 6
I like how he filled it in a dealer ship
You know it’s only gonna get worse for that Ferrari 😂😂😂
Exotics  demo derby that would be great
The pencil at the end Lol
Ferrari watching this rn:😳
You just sold millions of those car balloons for that company as well bub
YES YES YES, i just wanna say thanks Cody. Youre the man and your videos never fail to make me laugh dude.
TREMENDOUS 🤣👏🏼 I'm surprised at how well it ate that hill
ferrari should pay you for this video
We’re is your tank  😂🎉
Should be an ad for the car bubble!
bubble testing day one went awesome! excited to see bubble test day 2
😀😀😀😀😀
اول عربي
There's someone wrong with the world when the most useless people, actors, musicians and sports stars, YouTubers are the richest
I double liked this I liked it so much lol
Tell Ferrari to suck it! You own the car, they don't own you
Welcome back young man you didn’t disappoint a usual 😂
I'm glad the old wife is gone, hopefully then you can spend more money on ridiculous frivolous things like this Ferrari.
Freaking Epic. 😂😂
That was the best advertisement for that car bubble possible 😂
i absolutely lost it at the ending 😂😂😂😂😂
Can I Buy U Car ?🙏🏼pls
Better off road than I would of imagined.
Reminds me of when you did wrench dodge ball in your garage
More damage please, that thing still looks like it needs to be broke in... Pretty sure you did the bubble wrap wrong, you're supposed to vacuum seal it not blow it up, I hear it works better that way 😁
Balls
LMFAO LOVE IT
I feel like I always need to watch these videos right away, just in case they get taken down. Gosh dang and they never let you down.
The car air blanket sells are about to go through the roof..lol
When I play forza horizon and go over dirt roads with supercars in like this is so unrealistic! But man you brought fiction to life literally man. 👏🏽 👏🏽 hats off ! The only downside is the fact that after thing long waiting you got us only 14 minutes! But nvm I’ll wait for the next.
How did he go from D Maxs  to Ferraris
Surprisingly didn’t end that bad, now throw it at a house like you did with the g wagon.
That is the greatest ad for that car bubble😂😂
Lol brilliant 😂👍🏻
4:03 plop 😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Don’t do that 😆😆🤣🤣🤣🤣
There's a video from Dominic Republic riping a 720s on a muddy trail road like a savage, not to this level but still, a damn 720s
me trying to get to the waypoint in forza
I want to say “why”. When you were first getting popular you were doing really interesting and novel things. Now since you Hollywood famous you just buy expensive things to destroy them. Seems really reckless and lazy. I don’t even watch anymore. I would rather you drive in on a sweet track then give it away to someone.
I'm scared to watch this one... Lol
I can’t wait to hear the pissed off Italian and see the DMCA letter on your instagram.
As he says “if it’s red it’s dead” 😂😂😂
would have been sad to see you go through that thick grass and hit a rock...great video
Ferrari working on their 300 page letter watching this
You should cut the fenders for some off-road tires.😂😂
This is prob my favorite video he’s ever made…nothing like not carring abt other peoples feelings and laughing when they get butt hurt
lol
thats how u drive supercars hahaha
It’s amazing how every video is next level. It’s awesome how far you’ve come.
Nicw throwback to the tool fight
This makes me so happy. Ferrari has been trolling customers for years.
Dude makes the best videos lol
Bruh you guys threw so much shit in the ending 😭
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Please do a durability test on a Tesla!
*gently places a lot of random stuff on bubble *
Me driving on the mountains in GTA
Bro do a durability test of a new tractor!
CAN I DRIFT IT TO 😂😂😂
Hello I love your videos
You're smarts to post this now because the people from Ferrari are asleep. They won't know what hit them until they wake up.
Guys don’t hate.  Life is too short to not have fun
@Ferrari
That last scene was absolutely hilarious
6.4 Powerstroke durability test would be great 😏
The video had stopped and I was still looking for 15 seconds till I realized. Thumbs up 👍
Bro when you done with it, hit me up, I want it!!! Haha
It was very satisfying watching you guys throw stuff at your Ferrari.. 😂
It's a 2 in 1 review lol
That'll buff out
Dedicated to Ferarri and its legal antics... this one is for your Ferarri!!!
Be careful, you might get a lawsuit for sitting in it!
8:56 coolest pic
Hell yeah! Best video yet, keep doing what your doing whistlindiesel
The pen at the end had me
That last screw at the end was cherries ontop
Best video to date
GOAT OF YOUTUBE
Yessir
Irl forza
I needed this
are those all gun and ammo cases lining up the wall in the end?
can we appreciate how well that car cocoon is made
Legendary
this is amazing
😂
More car bubble durability test!!!
ENDING was EPIC!!!!!! Seriously laughing out loud!!
Snobs is the 1st word I think of when I hear Ferrari. I'm surprised those Guinea pricks sold you one. I will enjoy the destruction almost as much as you killing a squatted pick up
😂😂😂😂
That bubble cover is pretty impressive
Whistlin gonna be banned and getting a lawsuite
😂😂😂 W vid
Thank goodness that over
Threw everything but the kitchen sink at it lmao I was waiting for the sink 🤣🤣
Love it.
Whistling diesel destroying a Ferrari mean while I can't even buy a happy meal at McDonald's
Can I be your friend 😂😎
SHIT JUST KEEPS FLYING!!!
bringing back memories of taxtherich. something about these cars getting hooned in a field is just cool😌
Amazing, reminds me of TAXTHERICH videos, but better.
What a fuck you doing bro!
Wtf legendary
I wish a kitchen sink went flying the air at the end
The bubble was more impressive than the car
Lmao all of the military stuff in the shop
Can you buy an $80,000 Tesla just to give it to me?
I love it!
I hope he destroy it 😂
That was great
That was awesome!
are not going to talk about the classics in the background at the beginning?
This reminds me of those old “tax the rich” videos 😂😂
This video is gonna break the internet
Funniest video ever
Ferrari has to be very tight 😂😂😂
The ending is too good
this is great
We are going to need daily uploads for this Ferrari
Wistlin : Give me a hammer Team : throw whole accessories 💀
i love it
Notification Squad!🔥🔥🔥
As always. Highly entertaining.
The only bad thing about this video is how long it’s gonna take to reorganize the shop after that ending.
Brooooo this was great 😆😆😆
Diesel going beast mode!! 😂😂😂
Who's that curly haired nerd ruining the video? Get behind the camera where you belong.
Nailed this one.
amazing video
The day has finally come.. yes another release
Great video.
HELL YES
Thank you for this video! Jay Leno refuses to buy one so that's gotta tell you something. The nerve to tell someone how to own a product AFTER you give them 1/2 a million dollars and you OWN it!
Don’t say he’s back, CAUSE YA BOY NEVER LEFT!!!!
This was all definitely a sponsor for the durability of the car bubble
This is the best ever
I love the lamborghini evo cover , great touch!
Solid minute of them throwing random shit at the car was hilarious 😂😂😂
All I ask is please don’t destroy any Lamborghinis because I live those things
Yay
They threw everything except for the kitchen sink
Can’t wait for you to do Subarus !!
Man this is legit on my top 5 best YouTube videos I’ve ever seen. Man you’re the king! The guy you met in London who drifts his lambo I mean just a noob, wow I mean I’m watching and it’s like can’t believe it!
That thing was resprayed salvage
Lol
Best use of a ferrari I've ever seen
I missed these just stupid, funny videos like this. Keep up the good work man.
Ferrari is joining rally

Unironically impressed it drove as well as it did in the dirt
I will buy a lug nut off of that when your done with it
Damn y’all got like 1000 ladders!
Saw your community post and turned on all notifications. The only channel that i care for like that. 🔥
It was a shame that, after this video his stuffed himself in his suitcase, after being brutally cease-and-desisted by Ferrari
Epic f Ferrari
((Ferrari)): SHUT IT DOWN!!
Bro you literally just re-enacted Forza Horizon 5 driving that thing in the field LOL hell yeah!
Your content is getting better & better :D
I was thinking this wouldn’t survive the running over log durability test but since it has a skid plate… at least add wings if you drop it from a helicopter. Edit: WD threw all that crap at the end himself.
My favorite video of all time you’ve made. Fawkin love it
Oh and ah whats in those cases😳
I know u destroy stuff but for real would be a cool car for collecting  🤙 with the r8 and lambo but sick how it handled offroad😂
Real life forza
Let’s go Brandon 🎉😂
5:57 the "thicc-fil-a" sticker on his shirt 🤣💀
This was beautiful
Best video ever
OMG!   That was pretty epic when most everything was thrown at the car while it was inside of its "bubble"  The only thing that I did not see get thrown at it was the Kitchen Sink!   Yeee Haw!   Awesome video!!!
Forza 5 in real life
IMAGINE getting sued for re painting a car you worked your ASS off for. Ferrari is just that dude at a bar that wears khakis shorts and starts shit with everyone because their daddys a lawyer😂😂😂

Perfect!
Hell, yeah. Been getting teased for so long on IG, I've been on the edge waiting for this one.
😭🤣🤣❤️💕
Please God paint farm use on the side
This is amazing lol
I can’t wait to see what’s in store for its future!!
I bet you won't destroy your Audi R8...
watch ferrarri try to sue now just like when they tried to sue 50 for painting his
You make someone else richer when you do this 😁😆 ❤️🙏🏼♾️🏆🎫
Shoukd had bought a new denali hd Or every generation denali hd and product test to see what's the best
Forget getting sued, Ferrari is going to send a hitman to WD's house for his war crimes.
mad respect bro
This man playing gta in real life
I saw it on tictok can’t wait
Every sf90 owner is excited that their car is now rare since there’s one less in existence 🤣
Everything about this is great
You wild my guy!!
Those green plastic containers.  When I was active duty airforce (combat comm), we'd have stacks high of those same green plastic boxes.  High quality stuff. They even have purge buttons on the side since its air tight.  The black plastic molding inside used to smell like rotten dog shit, but if you wanted to keep super expensive equipment sealed from air, water, heat and shock from being dropped from 50 feet, then those where the boxes to use.  We used to take them when we'd get new ones, but we only had lots of the two man carry ones that were big.  The smaller cases was always grabbed by the seniors.  Good shit to have tho
What happened to his old camera man with the glasses jason
Let's gooooo
ITS TIME
ForZa irl

Wow, Forza Horizon 6 looks great! Supercars were made for off-road.
That bubble is stronger than a Trojan

This action will have consequences
Bro need to throw it with a helicoper
Flat earth

The Doug DeMuro joke caught me off guard 💀
Been waiting for this. So pissed I can’t watch right now but I will be back mark my words.
Cody one day if you have a Ferrari or Lamborghini you could just give it to me instead of destroying it, that would be great thanks!
top tier
In ironically a great ad for the car bubble. You should be cashing a huge sponsor check from that.
Best Youtuber on The platform 👏

i like it how people were/are mad over the old content with a 10,000-100,000$ trucks and other vehicles.. and now we have this lol
Ok I enjoyed every second of this. I do not like Ferrari because I think they are over played and just boring. I’d much rather drive your Huracán tbh. Still a cool car nonetheless,cant lie if I said I didn’t cringe because I totally did. Super excited to see how Ferrari reacts to this lmao.
Took sooo long!!!
W video w content
everything red needs to die!!
oh no it’s red
this guy is gonna start ford v. ferrari part two
Lessss goooooo
"Douchebag" That's the first word that comes to mind when I see your face.

Love you Cody!!!
This dude really wants to get black listed 🤣
Ferrari is going to be pissed😂
While I don't like Ferrari I think this is just stupid yet another dumbass thing to do.
too much money + child man = whistelindiesel
Bruh. When I was a kid Ferrari was  my go-to “made it” car. Way to go man. You’ve made it. Long ago, but you’ve made it.
Huge inspiration cody!
Please Destroy all Ferrari’s, because the snobby people of that company deserve it!
Yessssss yessssss yessssss
400k? Shoulda just bout one in Europe and shipped it over for half the price
Ferrari is suing him for sure
Oh wow, you're alive 😆
