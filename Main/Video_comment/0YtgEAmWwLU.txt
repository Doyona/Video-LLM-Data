Can you make a video on combatting people that bring their keepers out? It feels like I’m consistently unable to score when they bring their keeper out this year.
THANKS
Mate your a legend for this one 👏👏👏
Tiktok gang
these tactics suit me im getting too exposed when i play the 433
Great tactics mate.  Watched a few other vids and don't come close to this
This formation is awful  Don’t use it they just go wide and cut back for an easy goal
This tactics helped me so much, thanks, one of the best fifa youtubers
حفضك خويا
thanks mate
it works
You save my life bro
Thanks for the tips bro it helped a lot
Great help here. I’d been trying this formation and was on a losing streak.  What turned it around for me was keeping my defense narrow and compact and also changing the striker to more of a holding player servicing the LF and RF.  Great vid and really great help, thanks!
Just played my first game with it. I like the defending and how free you are on the ball in the middle with the central mid dropping back. Thanks for the tactics
This here changed my life, was having the worst WL and now im on beast mode. You are goated.
I Wouldn’t be the best at the game. I Was struggling to get wins and now I have 3 wins in a row with high scoring games. Thank you 🙏
Dude you don't explain why do you use this as your defensive tactic. What about offensive and normal tactic? you do use 4-4-2 as your normal formation.
love this formation, so easy to create chances and get into positions
Dude this formation… 16 division matches undefeated 🙄 13 wins and 3 draws 😂
What is the formation?
Showed 3 different formations and only one tactics
I dont get it. Your squad is on 442. Defensive is 4231 and ofensive is 442. You in a game use both Defensive and ofensive by switching them with the arrow shortcuts? I dont understand why your squad is 442 but the táctic is totally diferent. Sorry im new at fifa
Thx so much. I ve been running 4231 or 442 since fifa 19 and i was so bored of playing one-two through balls all the time. This changed my way of playing fifa and im enjoying it very much. Took a bit of getting used to, but attacking with wingbacks is very underrated. Jesus navas if is so good in this formation
No one wants to watch 10 minutes of you talking just tell us what we need
Hey dude. You were editing the defensive tactics. Do you just set your team in game to defensive for this to work?
Interesting tactic. In fifa 21 I finally settled on a 451 and brought that into 22 and not had as much success. There a lot of similarities between 451 and this formation - I like having the narrow defence and sitting CDM - so will give this a go to see if it works better.
Update: This guy knows his onions.
Starting to think all these videos are bullshit, I mean why would these guys want us to be good?
There is no way your defence is that deep on 55 depth, I run 30 depth and they’re outside the box.
Thank you for all of your wonderful content! This helped me realize I am conceding by staying out too wide with fullbacks and leaving my box undermanned.
Is a 4 5 1 formation good?
what in-game camera angle is this?
So when put my play style on defensive in game will my players start doing the custom tactics?
I currently use a 4 1 3 2 formation do you think these tactics will still work or not
werner and lukaku in this formation🔥best tactics ive used this year and will be using this fully moving forward, great vid👍
Can someone please explain what settings are changed when going attacking ultra def/attack or are you playing defensive all game ?
ive played 30 matches in New allegiance. lost them all. scored two goals. will give this a whirl.   ocampos, lautaro and di maria as forwards.  eriksen verrati  and paredes.  silver r. henry , godfrey. gomez and trent.  gk is lloris.   will let you know how i get on. Thanks for making video
Also my Italian team is good at attack rubbish at defence and midfield 😡 I can't afford to spend 500 like everyone on here I'm not sad enough to do that
Please advise me how you compete against morons who buy the win by buying the best players vs a team worth less than 100k it's utterly pathetic. These idiots are ruining the game for everyone just can't compete no matter the tactics they walk through defences shoot from 50 yards and it goes in 😡. Any advice for full on defence and counter?
Bro I have been loooooooking for a formation, going to try yours now and ill let you know :D
No joke since this formation and tactics I’ve made 3 people quite in a row and scored so many more goals! Great vid 👍🏼
I'm a bit confused. Do you always keep your ingame settings at defensive and not balanced or attack? Great video btw.
Where's the attacking tactics?
After this vid all I do is win
I normaly dont leave comments to but this is crazy i feel like the comment under here, i whas getting anoyed i losing allmost everytime anyway and first time this one actualy won 😅🤩 2-6
Have you tried any of the 3 at back formations this fifa tried 1 and seems to work attacking wise but constantly getting caught on counter
You might not beleive this. But I'm in Div 3 (and have been for about 4 days), and I used this exact system (I mean EXACT). In Div 3 I have lost about 70 games and won only 20. When I'm constantly facing good opponents, with messis, Mbappes, Ronaldos, it's really a struggle, the opponent defends well, and it's impossible to deal with toxic players using the best players in the game, ESPECIALLY on the counter.
Tiktok gang
First game using it battered 5-1
Well this was a waste of time! The people who saying this is a good tatics they playing in div 10, also he showed only the defence part which is so bad! If you guys are at div 6 do not use this tatics, next time my guy try to show more of the tatics than your div 10 rivals matches thx
Can you share tactics and gameplay for 4-3-3?
game is garbage- they removed skill level also- I keep playing the same 5 people who should be like div 1. I am a div 6-4 player. wtf is this EA
Who agrees this guy looks like ally law 🤣🤣
u talk a lot
I’m confused are you using a 4-3-2-1 or a 4-2-2
Appreciate the tips man but this did not have to be 10 minutes long
Keepers are cancer in 22
Why do you use a more "attacking" setup on the defensive game plan??
What happened with showing cb's and goalie?
This formation is off genuinely it’s terrible
The best formation is 3-4-2-1, it is the most solid defensively and offensively.
Sick video man!
hated it
These tactics worked really well for me thanks
TIK TOK GAAAANG🔥🔥
These are rubbish tried them out and couldn’t win as soon as I switch back to my old ones I start smashing it again
What a goat you are with these I've been om fire with this formation defensively and offensively
You talk too dam much
TikTok gang
TikTok gang
I'd like to see a 4 3 3 (4) as that is what I was using due to Google gonna try the 4 3 2 1 now
For ps5 bro?
I personally think that the 3-5-2 is a great formation this year
TikTok Gang👊🏼
Tiktok gang!
TikTok gang
What camera is that
I’ve always played 433 attack in Ultimate team but I feel this year I’m getting exposed. Especially against players with 442. Nice video I’ll try it out. 👍🏻
41212(with wingers) is the most balanced formation, defense + attack.
Dude  This is a Great  one 👌🏽!!!   ME AND MY CONTROLLER  THANK YOU !!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I have been  struggling  to find a formation  to use and on top of crappy game play I was losing  my mind, but I decided  to try this formation and 1st game I come up against 2 icons and I bossed the game following your tips I took the lead early he tied with Pele but I never felt I was chasing the game . I felt comfortable  and in control  and won this is a great one appreciate it brother 🙏 🙌 💯 💪!! Keep up the great content 👍🏼
Bro thanks.  It has been really helpful.   From Nigeria 🇳🇬 💎💎💎
Tiktok gang ❤️
Well I packed Mbappe in a 2 rare players pack(untradeable) need to find out which formation to slot him in at now
Awful
Am I supposed to go straight defensive as soon as it starts?
Thx mate! I have tried 1 match, berg good offence!🙌🏼
Successfully found the meta and ruined the game in one video about 14 out of my last 15 games the opponent used these and it was so boring to play against.
Tik Tok gang!
Omg I’ve won 4 in the row with this formation and custom tactics I’m impressed
its so unclear he jumps over twice from screen and there is somthine completely diff on the tactics without him telling what for
Second player press is so gd this fifa
442 for me best so far
Sorry but worst formation.... Even the basic 4-4-2 is better without any tactic and instructions. Team defending is horrible atacking is to much central no space for anything. 10games 9 lose with this...
Been using my 4600 points from preorder on draft and while I don’t mind playing draft too much, it just always reminds me that it sucks not having custom tactics. Players go all over the pitch!
As an American that knows almost nothing and is just starting the game, what recommendations would u give me? Need a lot of help
Cheers lost first game
Whats a good formation for Serie A players?
343 is what I’m rocking atm
TikTok gang
Insane tactic!!
Could you use this in a 4-3-3(4)??
TIK TOK GANG  LOVE WHAT YOUR DOING FOR THE FIFA COMMUNITY🙌
Best players to use with this formation?
These tactics suit me crazy good qualified for WL with these great job 👍
What’s the player instructions for both cb’s ?
I don't usually leave comments, but after playing over 10 games of rivals with this formation+custom tactics I  actually can't believe how good they are, they've made me go from hating the gameplay to actually really enjoying it. Thanks.
Would you say the 433 flat is meta with getting good box to box midfielders like can renato sanchez and sissoko

Server disconnects are def a thing this year
TikTok gang 💞
Massive massive thank you for this. I'm a fifa OG that hasn't played for around 4 years. Used to be quite good but find myself struggling massively. Everything feels hea y and slow. This tactic has definitely helped a lot.
Delaney over cam? Good or bad
Instagram Gang 🤑
I played 4-3-2-1 all last year. Kinda sucks that it doesn’t suit my playstyle on fifa 22.
I think the 352 is the best, really balanced good in both attack n defense
Tick tick gang love the content
What’s ur camera setting please dude
This formation is soo good. Thanks a lot, just the players going forward there is so much support and I’m winning my games by at least 3 goals. Thanks mate
Tiktokgang
Instagram GANGGGGGGG
I have no idea how to work tactics on this can someone help me what’s best for this etc I am a fifa player but never bothered with tactics until now because of the change of gameplay
Tik tok gang!!! Best formations and tactics💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿
Tiktok gang 😎😎
The game is broken. The formation is not really impirtant depending innyour players but depth doesnt work. Goalkeepers are funny. They can block full power shots from 5 meters out.
TikTok gang x
Tik tok gang
Used 4-3-2-1 and went 3-0 down within 16 mins, would not recommend that… got my arse handed to me
This tactics shit how can I play counter
In rivals Im 15-0-2 with the 4222 and 4231, really want to try this 4321 after seeing this tho
When i used these tactics all my players would clump up on the opposite site of the pitch? Found my opportunity to create chances was literally zero??
man, i was div 4 player in rivals and comfortably gold3 in champs, but this game im struggling to score, lost 3 games in a row 0:1 in div10, feels like im the only one who is not enjoying new fifa
TikTok Gang👊
Good in attack but defensively troubling
We’re the Albion boys making all the noise everywhere we goooooo
A video explaining each formation and the play styles they support in FIFA 22 the best would be really useful, if possible please!
Hi mate, thanks for the videos. Could you do a tutorial on the new left stick switching option? It’s really confusing for me 😅 thanks
TikTok Gang 🔥
I needed a formation that will help me cos I’ve not found one yet that I’ve stuck with. Great video mate hope you’re well.
Instagram Gang
Up the analyst man
do we change player instructions ?
I just hate this guy and other youtubers when they lunch a new video “new meta formation this , new meta that” because it makes everyone play ultra defensive. Instead of promoting the game for it’s fluent dribbling and pushing people into playing more attacking he goes full park the bus and crap. What a total wanka
Thank you man so much before I saw this video I couldn’t find a formation I could attack with. These tactics are so good 🔥
Instagram gang
opinion on the 4-4-1-1 formation
TikTok Gang
Nice I shall try. Any tips for tackling? I hardly win any tackles, rebounds always go to the opposition.
TIk tok gang 💪🤛
Discord army
Tik tok gangggg, defo using these tactics 🔥
Hey mate, just wondering who you think is more likey to hold their value, Llorente or KDB, as I can afford one of them and want to build a squad around them ! Cheers
TikTok gang
Hey mate what is your camera angle that you use my game is so zoomed in on tele broadcast I like yours alot
Tik tok gang
Loved your 4-2-3-1 tactics managed to tweak them to suit me, question is would Sancho be good as the attacking CM in the 4-3-3-1?
Brooo🔥🔥🔥🔥 I haven’t lost with these tactics thanks 💯💯
Tik tok gang
Who would you use for attacking cm and balanced cm out of Foden and KDB
Opinion on KDB as a CAM and Lukaku as a ST for the 4-2-3-1?
TIKTOK GANG!!
Tiktok gang 💪🏿💪🏿
What are camera settings u have one? I really like how you can see almost 1 half of the field!
You guys are sleeping on the 3-5-2
Loving the vids! TikTok Gang!
TikTok  gang!
tiktok gang!  love the vids man keep them coming🙌
That’s my comeback formation! Always a big fan of 4321 you can play it many different ways.
Dead tactics
Thanks,  I had some joy using the 4231 & 442 from the last tactics video, will try this one out as well. cheers!
Tiktokgang!
tiktok gang
Could you use De Bruyne in CM in this?
Tick tock gang!
TikTok gang gang gang
TIKTOK GANG!!!!
Used this in my first draft and won the draft. Havnt looked back since.sarr and Toney 🔥in this formation
Try 71 for auto offside traps
So what’s better to play in at the defense or attack? What would you say is better? I’ve seen people use it in attack.
Wouldn’t it be better to have the attacking CM on the opposite side of the attacking full back for more balance?
Tik tok gang
Mate which the best pl starter team budget 200k 😓?

How do you do that thing where you have another player running at them whilst controlling the other
Tik Tok gang

You play old gen or next gen version of the fifa 22?
Tiktok gang
What is your caméra plz
TikTok Gang❤️
Do you have the left and right forwards on stay forward aswell as stay central
Tiktok gang
Tiktok gang!
TIK TOK GANG!!!! Great video as always Al
Tiktok gang
Does the Left CM on “get forward”, have to be pacey? Would somebody like KDB work there?
10 minutes fraudulent behaviour
So which formation it is xD
How about a 5-4-1 with the fullbacks on join the attack? I use it in fifa 21 and its a load of fun. Having 3 quick center backs makes it more viable to have offensive center mids, that aren’t super good defensively but can bang it from the outside or make a run for goal. Without a 3 in the back, then at least one the center mids needs to be defensive and put on stay back, and even then its not the same as having 3 center backs.

What sort of striker would you suggest using someone such as Werner or would Lukaku be usable?

See it on Twitter and tried it and love it. Just works. Thanks
Instagram gang 🤙🏼. Enjoying the content my Man , your one of major reasons I was ballin with an rtg on fifa 21 🔥
Would this formation work with this team gk-pope rb-Fredericks CB- ake cb- Romero lb- tierney rcm- doucoure cm- ndidi lcm-Saul rf-Lucas moura lf-jota st Gabriel jesus

Merci bro 💪🏾💪🏾🤙🏾 merci beaucoup  Bonjour ✌🏾 Sorry for my english im speak french  so i have   Mané Martial Moura  Bruno Fernandes  Allan and  fred    It is Good for  your formation bro ? Or i change my players ? Or i play in 433(4)?  Or 442 ?    i don't know what to do i have a lot of trouble on this fifa
TikTok gang!
Tik tok gang
This is absolutely game changing!
I’ve been a fan this formation since FIFA 20 every year I’ve changed the tactics accordingly to fit the META and gameplay. This year I’ve been using it a bit, my tactics are similar to yours but I use “possession” and occasionally “long ball”, I’ve also tried using “false 9” on the striker but not sure I like that too much, and also my full backs on “inverted” runs with the one playing on the same side as the attacking CM on “balanced”, and the other on “join the attack” and both on “conservative” interceptions. It’s a bit more aggressive and may be better suited for later in the game when we start to get higher rated players.   I’m going to give your tactics a run tonight. 👍
Don’t like these in the slightest attack is decent defense is nowhere to be found
Tiktok gang
Tik tok gang. Good video as always keep op the good work
Should I have haaland at RF becuase of the 3* wf and Ben yedder in the middle or the other way around for the dribbling

Yoo bro..I try to ask this question a lot of friends and they have no answer.  Why why and again why what is this nonsense for what is so much information?  Who benefits from it.  Too much text on the main page is difficult if at all to know what formation your opponent is playing.  I think it's not necessary.same game same bullshit
Nice video, I’ll need to give it a try 👍🏻 I’ve found my favourite formation so far is 5-2-2-1 but switch to 5-2-1-2 in game. I’m currently in Div 6 and rarely lose despite my team only costing around 30k and I’m not exaggerating when I say EVERY team I’ve come up against is worth way more than mine! In game my team is  GK: Emiliano Martínez 🇦🇷 (2.5k) LWB: Kieran Tierney 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 (1.7k bought w/Anchor)  LCB: Nathan Aké 🇳🇱 (2k) CB: Antonio Rüdiger 🇩🇪 (12.25k bought w/Shadow) RCB: John Stones 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 (1.7k bought w/Anchor) RWB: Ricardo Pereiera 🇵🇹 (4.5k)  CM: Thomas Partey 🇬🇭 (1.4K) CM: Tanguy Ndombele 🇫🇷 (First Owner) CAM: Wilfried Zaha 🇨🇮 (6.5k bought w/Hawk) ST: Patson Daka 🇿🇲 (1.2k bought w/Hawk) ST: Adama Traoré 🇪🇸 🌟 (4.8k bought w/Finisher)  Super subs:   Ryan Kent 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿  Rafa 🇵🇹  Henrikh Mkhitaryan 🇦🇲   Bought Adama this morning for 4.8k with a Finisher chem style and he is genuinely my favourite player I’ve used this year! So ridiculously overpowered! 10 goals and 9 assists in 10 games so far (keep in mind I’ve only played insane teams so far as well), worth every penny. Ryan Kent closely following behind.
Instagram gang!!  On a side note cheers for this been struggling to find a formation will try this

But now i cant even pass the ball haha is the game harder this year with these mechanics, my team/ formation/tactics are bad or i'm the problem?

Great vid! I was using it last year when the other formations weren't doing the job, and it was every now and then an effective joker. So I look forward running it for a couple of games.   Currently I am mainly using 5-3-2 / 5-2-1-2 and also find it working often enough. However, I am sure you can find the better width and depth and other little teaks to optimize it. Would love to see a vid about one of the 2!
Just dropped my 442 for this so going to try it now ! thanks for the tips !

I’ve been using similar tactics and enjoying the formation, I’ll be sure to give these a go and see  if they deliver.

Im not sure if you are serious or not but with this tacs u have no def yeah in the off you are good but one long ball and your Opponent wll score
