Thanks bro
Yep 2012 wasnt really that hard idk why but try to spam all the giants and it all goes work 😅
Thank you so much
I'm here becaue my friend told me to do the challange even tought i dont want to and life is a pain
Why i lost interest for this game, i don't want to...i remember those days we play this game in a damn serious mode... No relationshits, no tensions about future, only school days and extreme level of excitement and happiness for this game... But now the time changed, so di i.... Why...? 🙁
Thanks for this idol, hehehe skl I beat this using a different method but okay hahahah thanks again, keep up the good work lods, and have a nice day
I watch some of the video of u explain the history then I seen the guys jump from the clash tower

Im as old as coc aka clash of clans
Alot
This helped my alsot thank you
I just putted my giants randomly and my bar anywhere and still got 3 star but nice vid
GATABON CLASHER HERE!!!
I did this one myself and in a simpler way. Didn't even have to do all that lure troops away stuff. Just giants to get the attention of cannons and archer towers and backing up with the rest of the troops, worked for me. The easiest challenge ever..
It's actually 11 bc 3 X 11 =33
OMG THANK YOU SO MUCH I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET THREE STARS AND NOT TWO TY SO MUCH
Thanks bro
I’m here because it’s been so long since I had to use these troops against these bases idk wtf I’m doing
Finished bro thanks 😎👌
Thanks 😊
Nice
Thanks you helped me so much!
TYSM TYSM TYSM
I didn’t win my first try because of the tesla

Thank you so much bro 🤟✌
POV: You watch this because you wanna beat the clash 2012
"....  Long may it continue", take note Supercell, JS knows what the community needs, Big Thank You Chief Sloth 🍻🍻
And ofc I beat the first challenge with my own plan
Yea
I really don't bother doing this challenge, but when I saw that one of the rewards is a new scenery, well as a F2P, I HAVE TO GET THAT
I was stuck on this stage with 2 stars but this tutorial helped me get 3 stars thank you so much! You gained a subscriber

Synch your audio, christ
jubo
Thanks bro I'm depending on your vid for my attack 🥰🥰🥰

Did it
I that true it has scenery reward?
Love from india
thank you judo that was really helpful👍🏻🙏🏻
Thanks
Beat this one in first attempt with your help, Thank you ❤️
Love you you're the best
Judo Sloth Gaming, I can't thank you enough for these guides, when I looked at the base, my jaw dropped. I am a  relatively bad player, so when we went from yesterday's challenge to this base, I was worried I would not be able to complete the challenge for all its rewards, but because of your help, I have three starred it very easily 😀
I got only two stars
Please send the video
Bro please send video on nine townhall
The air defense model is also the old style
Thanks bro
I hope this challenge icon will remain throughout the month becoz currently I am not playing due to exams🥺 Plz do respond judo if you have any idea it will remain or not.
Thanks, I beat it using this method
Thanks Judo
thank you so much judo for the vid  i could not beat the level after so many trys so thank you so much for the video , keep up the good work]
I beat it multiple ways
Do i have just one try or more?
I haven't got anniversary cake. Please anyone reply me what would be the reason behind this ??
i was about to three star this first time but there was a tesla and i didnt notice it, very unlucky
I did it by myself, practically was 99% 1 star the most part of the time XD
Love form india
I kept getting 98% because of that tesla and it was really ticking me off
Thank you Judo Sloth for helping us all that play Clash of Clans and, I think you really need some more Subscribers  Sub to Judo Sloth
Thank you bro!!!
I did the same thing but on the right side corner, and the Tesla caught me off guard lol. I still pulled through and got it first try.
Tomorrow I will purchase the pixel queen...and will put your code judo.. thanks for reminding 😁
Thank you for your support...
Where does Napoleon keep his armies?      In his sleevies.
I love you it clash of clans
They should add a skin on the builder base
"Yesterday is make history" "Tomorrow is mystery" "Today is gift" "That is why it called present"
The fact that 300k bots can't 3 star the first challenge 💀
Thanks for the help buddy , I'm going to get some stars our world's glory 💥💥❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰🙏🏽
i got 3 builder potions from 3 staring the 2012 base
When I watch your channel I get adds with you
Thanks I always 2 star 99% the base
Which army do you recommend for th12 farming?
lol I constantly get time fails and lose all my troops doing exactly this
Just bought all the anniversary skins and scenery with your code! Thanks for consistently uploading great content and keeping the community alive Judo!
very interesting stone old age base
They brought back The Four Stone thing obstacles
Does anyone know how long these challenges will be available?
Judo will be a legend of all time
If you cant even triple this challenge without any help you dont deserve this game😂😂😂.  Fun✌️😜
Thanks
Thanks
U are one of the best Tutorials ever with coc thank u so much for the help❤❤❤❤
You're such an og
If you think they should release a scenery that goes over into builderbase as well or a separate scenery for. Builder base. Ir even a hero skin for the battle mech give this comment a lik
Thanks judo i really wanted that scenery:-)
Will you do  a vid for 2013
Where is th 9 in the new scenery? 😂🤣
Awesome!
There’s only one thing that angers me about the new map, it’s such a minor detail but it still angers me:  The special map has statues of most troop, features, and most notably, every town hall…   EXCEPT FOR TOWN HALL 6 AND 9! I genuinely don’t know how they missed this, I looked everywhere, but they’re just not there. I can understand town hall 1 missing since you only have it for like 5 minutes, but why town hall 6 and 9?    …  6… 9…    ohhhhhh, I get it now.
Use code judo!!
this update is so cool
Btw love from Jamaica
I got 3 star easily
Wow So exciting
This actually is the first challenge i beat without your help, your videos sure helped me progress
Legend of clash of clans is back nice
Thank you judo
I purge the gold pass using judo code on the shop 😌😌😌
Why the HELL do my armies always split up in 3 ? 2 go sideways, and only ONE goes trough the middle where i actually busted the walls with a SIEGE machine, wallbreakers or JUMP spell.
The troll Tesla got me and I got 98%
literally a g
Bro i wish i saw this video it took me like 3 or 4 tries to get this
Judo ur awesome look how far u have come wit ur content..ur big inspiration to me bro 🙏
Thanks Judo ❤️❤️
Thank you so much!
You're a noob if you need this tuturial to beat this ez challenge
Thank you I played that level like 10 times and couldn’t get it lol this worked great
Bless up judo
I three stared it by using the wall breakers to destroy the walls by the mortars then after they were destroyed I soaked the rest of the troops in btw I did this in the morning before school
yeye
literal th8 stratgy
I started playing in 2013. I'm about to get some nostalgia.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. This is during my exams so I won't have my phone I can't miss this but I wont have my phone :(
I got 3 stars today i like the game so mutch cant stop playing it but only problem is i am on townhall 5 i started last week
I attacked from the top when I did this and tried to pull the wizards to the top right corner, finding that tesla there was definitly a surprise lol.
Imagine If I Was Judo Sloth ☺️☺️
i got 98%... BECAUSE OF THAT ONE F**KING TESLA IN THE CORNER THAT KILLED MY ONLY GIANT AND 5 BARBS AND ARCHERS
Thanks judo sloth
I 3 starred this on my own, but I most definitely will use your tips for the other ones!
The dynamic of the game is much different than the normal
I have a question I have been playing for a year and I haven't gotten ever gotten any special decorations like the 10 year anniversary special decoration
Anybody else experiencing lagging/stuttering after updating?
I bet judo won’t like my comment
It would be so cool in the challenges if they brought back the old troop and building textures and stuff and kept the old troop AI like the bad wall breaker pathing depending on the year of the challenge!
This Challenge is very easy, i did clear It by just spamming almost Everything in a row on the top right side of The base. With an exception of a giant and 2 barbs, archs and gobs for the mortar at the bottom.
Thank you helped alot...hope you do for the rest of em also...ill subscribe if i can join your clan..i made my own clan and no one joined...just me in it😥
I just go all in and somehow 3 star
Since 2 years ago i used one of ur strategies to complete one challenge,  that day i decided to click that sub bottom and im still proud of that
Why when you have a plan
Judo! Will the village skin we can unlock in the 10th anniversary challenge as the one in the shop, and showcased in the first challenge?? If not then i will most definitely be buying the village skin as well, obviously using your code!
Judo was best tutorial and helpful  😍✨
will you do tutorials for the rest of them
I followed your advice and got a resource potion!
thanks judo
In my first try I did 98% and missed that damn tesla as time ran out!
Thanks judo I'm a air attacker so i only got 2 star at my first time P.S- that Tesla was the reason i got two star(98%🥹)
I did not need even the tutorial at all,l already 3 stars😅
Rewards are really pathetic considering its 10 year anniversary
I just spammed and got 3 star
Judo sloth, all I did was just spam it all in by the canon outside of the base and i got a 3 star.
Always the best guider for me 😊😳💗
Always Count on Judo
Yo Judo noticed the 10th day will probably be some sort of sneak peak at the next th? Apart from new hero and a pet for it would love to see your ideas on what features could come with it
3 stared my first try. I’m an OG
I just spammed everything on the right-hand side of the base and 3*d XD
Hello bro the coc this is not video screen recorder working what will be the reason and how can we set it
The challenge was a no brainer but I love your videos. Great work 🙂
Eg
Happy 10th aneversary judo
Lol I heard the Tesla pop but I was like where was it? When I first played the level also thanks this was very helpful I want the scenery
I just randomly placed giants and supported them with barchers
thanks for the tip
Judo I took 3 stars much easier than your way
Judo your strategy worked
It sure bring back memories when I was still a newbie in clash of clans. Such nostalgic moments 😌
You have to 3 star everyone to get all the rewards
I finished this challenge by myself, but still watching the video
I enter your supporting code  Please reply me
Like every one say hes content is awesome
This was so hard I had to come to a yt vid for it
Can you help me upgrading 13 to 14 max ???🥲
Thanks judo sloth love you bro
Ya this anniversary update is awesome!
Clash making any challenge in the game: no one is gonna beat this, only the most skilled judo making awesome tutorials on how to beat them: are you sure about that?
Bro make easy attack Stargate of every townhall 2022
👴15                            🙄
Why do I have to use Goblins and barbs...why and why are they soo bad
Since you probably don’t hear it often I want you to know your strategy shown here was much easier, and dare I say a better plan than what iTzu showed in his video
Pretty disappointing anniversary so far. Thought they might do something to say thanks for playing but all that has appeared are a couple of very poor arcade style games and this new event. Oh but of course you can still help boost Supercell’s bank balance by purchasing all the non functional aesthetics. Game seems to be dying a long and painful death.
Thanks bro it helps me a lot
This challenge is harder than I thought but I got the 3 star eventually
Thanks for this video really helped me out appreciate it 👍🏼
Super update🔥🔥🔥
Does skins in coc get resaled? I don't have enough money to buy AQ's pixel skin for now
Big fan JUDO SIR... LOVE FROM BHUTAN 🇧🇹
DON'T DO THE GAME LIKE MINECRAFT😐
I done it 2 chance
I love your vids
I thought I got it first try but then there was a goddamn tesla in the corner and I had 4 archers alive 😭
Judo anna getting three star without your help
Thank you so much Judo 🤝
I've lost nearly 20 times in the 2012 base then I suddenly think about YouTube and this video was there at the top. I watched full of it and won it at one chance. Thank you soo much for this technique. I'll prefer this is the best and easy technique yo win that match.
I'm loving the new pixel art for the heroes. As a fan of pixel art I'm getting all the pixel skins for the heroes
Basic ,but for me that is not the fastest way in getting 3 stars .
Thank you,good video
What if I got the royale champion skin when I haven't unlocked her yet?
Yea I failed my first try but then I got a easy second three*
When is the released of the cake?
Bro I just noticed you can unlock a scenery
Thanks for this tutorial... I got 3 stars with your idea
I saw this late, but I'm actually proud of myself for three starring the base without any tutorial
Lol I got it first try without looking at this guide and just randomly placing troops around the base
do i need to enter the judo code before every purchase or is it enough to enter it once?
Already got this on first try
Me who had completed the challenge but still watching for fun If you think i am right 👍
Is it just me or cant you get the one gem donations because that barb King skin is blocking it?
Where does Judo Livestream?
THANKS💖💓
Your FIVE hour ago video 13k liks my 1 month ago video 8 viws 😭😭😢
watching during the maintenance break 🙃
Why i did not watch this first bruhh i got 1 star 72% i feel so dumb btw i am th 10 bruhhhh

Shout out to you judo from philippine , always supporting you when purchasing at the game ., god bless 🙏🙏🙏

I can't wait to use Code Judo on Friday! 🙂
I cannot enough thank you for checking the comments of the video and replying to them! One of the rarest popular youtubers who cares aboht their audience! Thank you so much Judo, I am going to buy for the first time (and of course using support code “judo”) all the Pixel Heroes for a few hours just to thank you for this! ❤
Thank god, I haven’t been a TH5 in so long that I’ve been embarrassing myself trying to get more than 1 star
i played coc for a long time, but was paused cuz i was introduced to new games but after i watched judo sloth i felt like playing again hehehhehe now i have 12 accounts in my clan whhehehehe 👌🏻 just typed the code "judo" hheheheheheh
Although I got 3 stars without this tutorial, I will say thanks on behalf of those who couldn't get the 3 stars without this
I really need to start 3 starring these things without watching a tutorial
I did it without the tutorial no flex 🥱
good video but I three stared it with my own skills
I beat it with another strat
we would like to buy goldpass but why its unavailable???
Thx judo for always bringing us helpful and nice videos. Never let us down. Been watching u for a year now and ur tutorial vids r always helpful
THANK YOU i was having trouble three starring it even though I'm TH 11 lol
petition to put sound effects and special voice in Party Queen skin😔  archer queen is the best hero for me but it doesn't have any effects on party queen skin, im so disappointed.
Can i do the challenges whenever I want or do they lock after a day of opening?
HAHAHAHAHA when I first attacked this base, I lured the cc from a corner and a tesla pops up, I immediately destroyed it with giants and archers and when I dropped the giants to distract cc, they striked me precious archers first because they are too close to them, and that made me question my th11-attacking mind forgetting the basics on targetting cc troops😆
Hi judo I received a message from judo sloth gaming on YouTube. Is this legit?
I did it without the tutorial
Lol love how my comment got taken down
I literally time failed due to this tesla and now I'm watching this video.I guess I learnt from my mistake.i will watch Judo tutorials to help figure out traps and clan castle troops and tesla.Thanks Judo!
Hi Boss Judo I have support you in clash of clan I have entered your code and boom I hope you will notice me in this comment anyways I watch your videos they are all awesome and giving me knowledge in the game also I'm a clan leader I have a member that wants to have a GOLD PASS but I can't afford it cuz I'm just a teenager but I really want to give it to him. Hope you see this comment and CLASH ON!!!!
Thank you so much judo for this video, I found it very helpful
Today's challenge is easier
Book Of Everything🤩, Thanks Clash Of Clans🥰🥰
That hidden Tesla got me I 98% 2 star the first time. Didn’t fool me twice tho
I don't know whether u guys noticed it or not but in this on the top u can see a mystery base I think it's about the new th 15 . Ik ik am awesome right 😁
I was 6 when coc released
The pixel heros are amazing 😍
Do we get infinite retries?
Thanks Judo this video helped me out becuase I would take out the main part of the base then all of my troops would die to the hidden Tesla
I put 1 giant and a wall breaker in  the norwest ish part basically the mid but the middle of the base then surround it with barbs then spawn all the giants but used wall breakers to clear traps and break the walls then used the goblins for clean up after killing the wizards then 3 stars
i was playing the challenge while watching this vid, thank you so much
Thanks
I done it all by my self its ez
My gaming guru Mr.judosloth🥳
Why they didn't include 4x loot bonus
Let’s gooooo! I started clash at 15 years old lol n Ready for 10 more !! What age did y’all start ?
Thank judo
Judo 👏👏👏👏👏
Didn't even need the .. tutorial for the first one
I Used 2 Barbs To Carry Wizards Near Tesla Then Giant At Tesla As Bait And Then 4 Archers To Destroy Wizards And Tesla Then I Started My Other Attack
Thank you mate i couldnt beat it
what's up what's up
I ve got 3 stars allready
I have 1st see u r video and I finished it in 1st try thanks judo 💜
Happy clashiversary
This challenge is a nostalgia spell.
1 done... 9 more to go
I beat it although my strategy was quite different.
This challenge was surprisingly difficult
this guy never fails to entertain, make good tutorials to us, and have alot of content ideas.
The aniversary scenery is awesome thinking of buying it but bit expensive
Omg judo thank ypu so much you really helped me out im so happy that i found your account your a legend❤❤❤
Thanks
I did it by my own iq and I get 3 stars first try
I bought anniversary special offers by using judo code
Buying the all the pixel heros with code JUDO has been input 👌
Imagine not 3 staring this challenge and you have to question your own skill.
Come on if u need a tutorial for this I'm consernef
Oops I forgot to watch this video before 3 staring that challenge🤣
I almost lost to that challenge because of the spring trap and the Tesla almost clutch my Archer.
thank you so much for helping me with this chalenge
If you need a tutorial for this, that’s sad
This is the coolest event in coc history i have 5 acc in coc soo i get alot of work to do to finish all this events  im soo exited
Its been 3 years and I am one of his earliest subscribers
Thanks
I tried to bring the clan castle wizards to the corner and the troll tesla was there
I was trying to take 3 stars for 5hrs 😭 after seeing your video it not even took me 5seconds to defeat then👍👍👍👍
Idk if this already exists in the game (please reply and let me know) but there were custom stones in the first course.
I love your videos 🥰
Judo, who is better at the game , you or Beaker?
Tbh, i just did my noob method when i also started playing clash of clans by just putting every troop in one spot
wow
Bruh i think a lot to 3 star that base i didnt know its just so easy but i didnt destroy the tesla or activate it hehehehe
Without watching this tutorial 3*
Thanks
i love clash of clans bruv
Look in challenge season
Men o'zm yuta oldim shunda ham raxmat sizni uslubingiz baribir mukammal.
Judo why you do not introduce new hero skin?
Feel so nostalgic.
hi judo, im th9, if i buy the skin for grandwarden and royal champ, will i be able to use them when i acquire the heroes in the future? thanks
I used the judo creator code after I had like bought one thing, and decided to also just submit the code on my second account as well, because why not. Wasn’t planning to buy anything else really until the deals of today that were just too good to pass on. Completely forgot about the creator code but luckily I did put it in the day before heh. I’m glad I’m supporting my favourite CoC content creator :)
It's been 10 years since a villager called me Chief, welcoming me to their village, I still remember those days when me and my friends playing Clash of Clans all night and we attack clan war together at the same time while listening one direction songs. Damn, missin' those days. Best childhood memories with you guys<3
Thanks i always time failed lol
so is that seriously the most maxed level base in 2012?
i was so distracted at the scenery i didn't notice the troll hidden tesla Lmao 🤣🔥
I love u judo, keep doing more vids keep up the good work
This helped so much.
Thanks
I use 2 wallbreaker just to remember wall nerf exist
Question if i am a th7 and above or whatever th level you get all the reward of silver track will i a th9 will recieve the pixel king
Supercell really outdid thenselves with the 10 year event. The freebies, challenges and minigames are just perfect.
I used 1 giant and spawn it to the hidden tesla in the right side of the base to lure the wizards, I just watched this tutorial after doing this challenge :)
Wow
dude the season challenge gave me a literal skin
Judo: i do think this is the easiest challenge of them all  Me who had to try it 5 times to perfect it: yea totally
th15 coming soon???
It's my birthday and the anniversary😁😊
My friend has got the new king Pixel skin with just attacking 1 from it why doesn't i have it
No tart cake  at this 10 anniversary  😢
I like the New Skin of Barbarian King .
no townhall 9 in the scenery🥲
Easier to pull and keep everything to the right corner where the hidden Tesla is… drop 2 giants there… barbs yo take out wizards… then   Your basically good to go
I still have the 2013 clash of clans app still works
Question if i am a th7 and above or whatever th level you get all the reward of silver track will i a th9 will recieve the pixel king
Thanks judo
Make a video on showcasing pixel heroskin series🦸‍♂️
The new king skin is kinda cute i just claim and the challenge is easy and im excited to claim the new scenery
Bro i was about to search this. Thank you Judo 👌
I just rushet everything in and it worked
Damn judo keep the good work up we love u man and your doing an amaizing joob teaching us new strats and combos like a true teacher of clash u are😂😂 Keep it up u earned a sub from me!
I tried to play without Judo's tutorial. I loved how he always taught us easy ways to achieve 3 stars. Now it's my turn to strategize by my self to learn. Thanks for the years. 💙
Wow thank you for this tutorial now I just got 3 star Very thank you❤️❤️❤️🤩🤩🤩🥰🥰🥰🥰🙏🙏🙏
i did my way and i 3 star
I already done the first challenge by myself. And then I watch this video and I'm realize, the difference between casual player and the god tier player 😅. You're awesome Judo.
I found a hidden Tesla in the corner while playing I was surprised
Do you have infinite trials?
I just spam the troops and won lol (even with the defending wizards)
Thanks for tips judo much love from sri lanka
I got 3 star just spamming on my 3rd attemps lol
Thanks Judo, I tried it by myself 6 times and failed but with your strategy i was finally able to 3 🌟
Meanwhile me just spamming all troops in and still getting 3 stars xD
Happy 10th anniversary for COC ..! Hopefully this game will bounce back and be busy again like 10 years ago. keep clashers excited . hello clasher . Love from indonesia .
I'm very happy about the Pixel king 😂
The troll tesla got me huhuhu
First time i got 3 star without youtube
i already did it lmao
thank you judo!
love u
Im embarrassed that i even needed to watch this
thanx judo i finaly 3 stared it
How I beated-in the right there is hidden Tesla so I dropped a barb at outer cannon and giant at right wizards came and I dropped 3 archers to clear them then dropped all giants on cannon then archers and barbs spam save goblins and 2-3 barb and archs and drop gobs slowly easy triple
Woah they listened just complained last week that th4-10 are underated
Did we have unlimited tries bro in this challenge?
I feel like the pixel skin of the king is slower.😂
You are amazing
I didnt did it that way it was too easy
Thank you so much
Thanks Judo😊😊
It's ez u just have to spam
I remember starting when clash first came out but I had no idea what I was doing, now it feels like a completely new experience coming back after 6+ years and it’s been so fun slowly rebuilding my base from scratch although the wait times kinda get long after a while…  I also discovered you recently and really like how informative your videos are! brownie points for keeping things simple and overall jolly, can really tell you enjoy helping out other players!
Only one book, for one hundred buildings? This is the worst 10 year aniversary in the History of Mobile Games
You waste 3 Barbarian you should have did it on the right and pull them using giant and also kill the tesla
Check trader's shop too
I did also conplete it by my oqn.
I 98 the map cuz of the tesla lol 3 star after
Thanks sir.... It's work

This time I don't need tutorial 🗿
381th
Thank you judo for helping me!
Really love this channel I have been watching this channel for about 2 years 😊
Thank you
I did it a bit different: barb same place then a giant top right to the tesla wallbreakers and giants going to the mortars killing mages with archers surrounding them barch to the left side of the base and goblins on top
judo, please review the pixel skin..🙏🙏
I just spammed all troops 😅
I needed this video

I just spammed everything down at the bottom and 3 starred.
thanks a lot judo i got the 3 stars so fast
I dont have a phone for the next 6 days, looks like this will be tight

My man
They have so much easter eggs in that map :D On the lower side of the map you can see a hog and hogrider on a bathtub that's a throw back to a commercial they did Larry the skeleton playing with elixir and more It would make for good content ngl
it's very helpful to attack 3 star thanks for sharing this video Hope to see more❤️❤️💚
I Done know u will reply to this or not But I LOVE Ur Vids SOO EXPLANED But i would realy Like If  YOU can Uplod more vids AND I LOVE UR CONTANTE
did it by myself, but see you tomorrow

This is the first ever challange I tripled without using yt tutorials 😂
Bro am confuse there is also a scenery in shop is it the same as the one in the challenge????
no limited edition obstacle till now🥲
Hi sir can I get a heart
Dude thank ❤️
The Troll Tesla got me so bad
Thnx for the video judo. but please tell how do we get the pixel king?
I think I saw you in the history of clash video dude! Hope SC is as good to you creators as it seems. Great stuff as always
Is there only one chance or unlimited?
there's no need for a tutorial bro its so easy! just my opinion HAHAHAHA sorry
Oh i got late
Thanks judo sloth for the help
I personally think that all of the pixel skins should’ve been in the pass
yay :D
join me your clan
The Hidden Tesla in the corner💀 98%
I had problems with the Mortar so my strategy was to take out those first, with the wizards as well. It's also really good strategy however!😊
Nice sir
I didn't even see this but I three stared by placing random troops 💀💀💀
1:11 what !! It's a legendary skin 🧐
SO OP!!! I GOT 3 STARS! THNX SO MUCH FOR THIS GUIDE!!!!   KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK LEGEND!!! 😃👍
Thank you judo for teaching us to beat that
Obviously OP
I win it before I see this vid I like you videos
Done attacking
Take love judo 💖💖
Such a good idea for their 10th anniversary to give us amazing rewards with the challenges, and also take us through a tour of memory lane.
Ez 3 star   Me already done
You really help me with those tutorials, keep up!
Thank you Judo for making this kind of contents. I will say Clash of Clans has never been boring. Happy 10th year Clashiversary clashers!🤙
What about the second att ? How to get 9str now
Funny fact you can three star. By only spamming all troops on the left end of the base
Wow judo you made it look so easy
I beat it vrong😁😁😁
Do i write judo or JUDO in creator code?
i got 3 star and thank you thank you thankyou!!!
Thanks dude
Thanks judo
I didnt even notice the wizards when i attacked lol
Honestly the nostalgia. Been playing since 2014 when I was just 6 years old (ik very young) so I only remember tiny bits of the game at that period but little things like the loading screen and having to pay to rearm bombs brings back so many memories.
Who else beat this challenge on their first try?
Wow
I had 3 staredv
I was completed in one try before your video uploaded
What does "the silver track of the season challenge" mean? I dont see the barbarian skin in the rewards for this challenge so im wondering where it is and at what point i can get it
Thanks judo I didn’t needed this but your still amazing and helping the people who don’t know how to attack
Amazing 10 years of the Greatest Game ❤️ Can't wait for more, events and celebrations. Thank you Judo for the walkthrough.
I hoped they reverted the troop icons back to the OG icons, so that new players could witness the horrifying goblin and giant faces
Judo what if there will be shrink potion trap in next challenge
I did it my self before i watched this video
Judo I have a 25 dollar google play gift card which I want to redeem and I was gifted by my us friend as I belong to India I am not able to redeem it how can I contact you for further information  I need your help  Because I want buy new scenery Please read my comment
i remember being able to sell buildings, i lost my first account because the ipad it was on broke and i didn’t have my login info 💀
Nice thx
So cool man
Bought everything new skins 🔥😍
The scenery looks like default scenery if u compare it. Well im hoping its false
E
MAN I LOVE THIS UPDATE EVERYTHING IS AMAZING
Thanks for this amazing video. You made everything easy. please make video for every challenge like this one.
I just spammed everything on the right side and got the three star
I think many people here play coc and cr
back to the days of peter17$
Much love from Serbia❤❤
This judo btw I'm your new subscriber ❤️
You’re are my favourite YouTuber for clash of clan. You got me back into the game 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
We also got pixel king skin its AMAZING tbh it has effects even on barbs
A nice "event" from Supercell for 10 years of CoC! Cool!!!😁 Btw I always use your code Judo, you're the best!
THANKS man it worked wish to see all the Challenges
Can anyone tell that what scenery will we get after scoring 15 stars in the challenge?
I've been playing clash for two years now.. i'm a free2play payer.I love  them adding some skins and sceneries to us as well. Long may it continue indeed
U r insane
Thanks bro everytime u guide us to complete challenges Thanks bro
I can't even go past the first challenge bruh
THE TESLA IN THE CORNER
no new troops or super troops or spells? im okay if no new town hall, but man we need new troops for new meta.
Judo coming and saving my sleep I really shouldn't have gotten on the game at 2 am, but after seeing the challenge,  I just HAD to finish it Thank you judo
i don't think that tutorial was needed
3stars in first try with 14secs remaining idk where that tesla came
i only started recently watching ur content but i really appreciate it
I already 3 starred this base, but I knew you would upload a video, and I was right
Its so easy lol
I am watching after i have completed. Never miss any of ur video
It was helpful for me and I am sure it is for more people too. Judo keep up the great work
cool they added the quadra stone things
Thank you for this tutorial Mr. Judo!
fun fact: in the new scenery there are two builders lying around that ARENT SMILING
OMG as soon as i wanted this guide u uploaded
Thanks judo and Supercell, these mean a lot to me and our clash mates. hope you could compile all the attacks in the 10 years clash 😆😆
It's funny because I tried to figure this out myself and did it! And now I'm watching this the strategy I used is extremely similar to yours Judo! Looks like I've watched too many of your videos that I attack like you now 😂
Thank you judo I got 3 Star,Before I was played i wasn't get 3 star's but now after watching your video I get 3 star's... Thanks 🙏 soo much 🥰 waiting for nxt video

I just spammed and some how 3 star
The challenge was indeed pretty easy to complete. Still took 2-3 attempts to complete by myself tho ✅️
Brother.... i felt like barbarian pixel skin movement speed is lesser than other skins....
There's ten days of rewards and Battles, and there's 10 days before I gotta go to school. 🤣🤣🤣
I wish i watched you before i do it... It took me 4 tries..
this helped me alot
I got pixel king skin.😍
Use code Judo  :D <3
Tysm for the tutorial 🔥👍

Why judo is voice low
Just take my wallet supercell😂😂
Where are the statues?
Yooooooo judo love the vids broski
I easily three star with every single attack I not needs any video gg judo 🥋
First try the troll tesla won...  Some of my troops were busy fighting the walls so the swarm was more like a few troops getting picked off at a time.
I already completed the first challenge minute after it came out
Tq for details
Thanks for the tutorial judo
Big fan judo, love your videos and the tutorials

Hi
Finally posted....Now I can play this challenge peacefully 😅💖
Happy 10 Years Of Clash.Clash Of Clans I Love it A Lot ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Minute squad
For me I think i dont need tutorial to clear this day's challenge 😆🤣🤣😂
😂😂😂 It is the hardest challenge 😂😂😂
Happy 10th anniversary clash of clans🥳🥳🥳
I totally loved the idea of this challenge. But I also hope there's more stuff coming, it's the 10th anniversary after all!
Omg thankyou judo was just waiting for u to upload this! What a journey coc has had with u in it! Lots of love❤
This is pretty cool!
Is it possible to attack same challenge again or we have just one chance??
Happy aniversary coc
I like the idea of using a giant as a target for the wizard so that the archers can shoot down the wizard. It's just like using a barbarian as a bait for the valkyrie so that the archers can shoot the valk.. I miss the old clash huhu
Thanks for the help Judo can't wait to see what kind of challenge you have in store for us next.
It's just 19 minutes ago. You're so quick 😅😅
Nice surprise by supercell
MR.JUDO  Do u know one thing           Ur my favourite coc youtuber Ever since i watching about coc in YouTube ❤️❤️
Judo is always early
oof i only got 98 percent from this method
Dies anybody know how Long this challenge is active? Because I can‘t play until sunday:(((
Luring CCs away at a corner, dealing with valks drag in defending CC using archers barbs. Good old days!!
Judo sloth never fails to entertain us
This is gonna be so cool
What do you think of all electro dragon troops because that’s all I use I’m town hall 11 btw but do you think the electro dragon is a good troop??
Love all your videos judo!💖
Awesome 🖤⚔️😎
Judo always come in clutch! 🔥💪
Ahhh the challenge reminds the old days when we had no poizon spells used to pull the troops to the corner and then bang spam all the troops ✌🏻
