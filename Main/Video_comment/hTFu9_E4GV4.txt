💀
They predicted that horrible Grimace Shake meme.
Do not eat the purple whopper either.
The Meme……
I eaten and I didn’t die
Came to this really late. Because I saw a short by a creator I started watching a bit recently, which was pretty much like the shorts shown lol. I saw it was a whopper with a red bun and thought I missed out on something really cool. And while it is cool, it's pretty underwhelming. All it had was red dye? Seriously they pour all that money into marketing, social media, and rebranding, but if anyone remembers, it was nearly a decade ago, but they once had a really interesting promotional whopper. It was around the time they teamed with Snoop Dogg and made the hot dogs and chili dogs, pretty standard, nothing to write home about. Don't quote me on nothin cuz it's been a decade, but I think I started workin at BK around the time of the hot dog phase. I was in high school. They were easy to make at least, so it was pretty laid back, all things considered. But what I really wanna highlight is this. The Angry Whopper. It was a red bun, but it actually still had white sesame seeds on it. If I remember right, it had a special spicy sauce on it, and the buns themselves WERE spicy and actually pretty flavorful compared to regular buns. I tried it by itself when I worked there. To this day, the Angry Whopper still holds the crown as my favorite item **from** BK. Best thing they've ever had next to their fries, spicy chicken fries, and original chicken sandwich with spicy mayo.. It was a 10/10 item, and it surprises me they haven't brought it back even ONCE at least where I live. Maybe in other places around the world, but idk. Maybe "being angry" or "mad" isn't something they wanna be associated and it just costed too much or people back then weren't big fans. But I LOVED it. Everyone's a critic I guess and doesn't like to try new things or stray too far away from the norm. Me and all my friends and my team members loved it though. Eh. Oh well I suppose. So the fact all this new Spider-verse whopper had was some red dye and black sesame seeds is pretty disappointing, but I don't feel as bad now for missing out on it lol.   Okay, so I might be wrong on that. IDK. But there was also a black whopper. Like super super dark blue I'd say is the color it was closest to. Still black tho. But RGB and all that. It had real squid ink in it. And you could taste it. Definitely cost them A LOT to make and it's no surprise they never brought that one back either. The red one was really spicy and a little bit sweet as well, but this one was even more sweet and also flavorful. It was delicious. But it's really exotic, squid ink is like a delicacy and ofc Uncle Sam's children aren't always gonna be the most open-minded or accepting people when it comes to foreign or exotic things. Even tho squid ink pasta is literally one of the most delicious things you will ever try in your life. But that aside, it also had no other differences that I remember. Just the classic whopper build on a different bun. The thing is I can't remember. One of them was called the Angry Whopper. And the other was called the Angriest Whopper. The squid ink one may have been the angriest, thinking logically about it. But I could be wrong. Red being angry, just because red usually signifies anger, but then taking it a step further, makes it black. Idk man. Anyways, what a time that was.   I hated that place, lol. Would never ever in a million years go back even if I was broke.
I tried the Spiderverse Whopper before and didn't have any major casualties or anything. I would followed the footprints of the Internet if I tried the Unicorn Frappuccino tho
Eugh why
I think that not eat it You trying eat   Me:mmmm spider-verse burger King   *eat spider-verse burger *   Me:mmm isn't was ba-  AAAAAAAA  *me send sky *  Me:AAAAAAAAAA
Eh its a burger what could go wrong.
I just realized this might have been why the grimace shake thing happened dear lord it's spreading across to other foods
It created an entire spider-verse in my bowels💀
"Guys its a cannon event"
now. its the grimace shake
I am the version of spider man where my webs are coems🤑🤑🤑🤑
I rather make my own burger rather than buy at the burger king
Rest In Peace TikTokers
I never ate one can anyone tell me what it does (no jokes pls)
Grimace shake, now this??
I Haven't tried that Burger 🍔 Before So what's Next Taco 🌮 Bell?
Red Spider Verse Burger + grimace shake = death 2?!?!
I love how this burger meme spread to the grimace shake
i never wanted to from the moment i saw it :skull:
Now we have the grimace milkshake When will we get the Colonel fries
History really does repeat itself 🤦🏽‍♂️
I got a ad for bagels💀
That burger started a trend of death that has spread to the Grimace birthday milkshake! 😂 I can’t wait for the next food item that causes death!
Don't Worry Guys its a canon event :)))
2:17 Please tell me you used that specific clip when saying "meme culture" on purpose. 😭
It was a canon event
U R so fired
You’d think they would have learned their lesson with the Halloween whopper
vali used to be an epic content creator  and now hes just saying things bout food to make his fan grow 💀 according to 1,829 mcdonald’s  and 2,781 BK workers, these taste good and it is not bad at all. i tried the “poison drink” at mcdonalds and it just tasted like blueberry. i tried the whopper, its just beetroot juice coloring. so it just tasted like a whopper. but with beetroot
I was so confused when
They say a bagel caused the spot to exist, yet this burger turned me into the spot
We all thought it.     What was it's canon event?
I hope Burger King shuts down.
I must eat the spiderverse burger! It's my canon event
I thought Burger King learned after the halloween whopper incident
But dued its a canon event
They kept reassuring me that my toilet blowing up was part of the canon event
far from home now
ITS A CANON EVENT GUYS !!!!!!!
ends on a cliffhanger but the best 2 hours of my life sitting in a chair.
its not right what people doing with that burger and burger king should block these videos or something bcs its bad for the fast food.
“Its not all about the whoppers spiderman”
1:26
I ate it
the bagel effect is real      i am ate it i think i am going to die
Oh no
I don’t believe it because I have not tried the spidervers burger yet
The spiderverse combo i had was a cheeseburger with onion rings and special mayo or something, and some of the fries were dark red and purple, it was pretty good but they forgot the bacon i added ;(
Eating it is a canon event
"MiLeS mArAs"
Why would I ?!?
y'all seriously don't know about red 40
the whopper won't be the same for that burger
I was swinging webs around Seattle!!!!
it's a Canon event.
It tastes like a million spiders are coming in my mouth
Why sony pictures why u didt add the whopper to the movie
Any nasty fast food burger will cause death 💀
The burger does actually look delicious not gonna lie  I still need to see across the spider-verse tho
When I tried it and it was good, but my stomach other than that it was amazing
I've seen it once and ill see it twice today
i think the burger causing diarrhea was quite expected if its dead built like the broodwich from aqua teen hunger force
🚑
This is why you shouldn’t eat promotional foods from any of the fast food joints. Lord knows what types of chemicals they’ve put in those red buns.
The burger must be more disappointing than the end of the film
dude it felt like a million spiders were coming inside of me after one hite
Bro, It’s a canon event🗿
I probably don’t understand this, but what I’m hearing is that there was misinformation about the dangers of that special burger… and it somehow actually made it more successful, rather than scaring people into going as far as boycotting Burger King??? I’m not even sure if it’s another troll attempting to sabotage for clout or not?
Why the hell does the bun look like a WATER MELON💀
1:31 We are so sorry about that tweet from the UK 😅
I could watch the movie again but, nah, imma do my own thing.
I keep trying to get this burger, but every time I show up at my local BK, they're out of it. :(
We also ran out of res buns
Work for burger king its a dyed red bun whopper and has swiss cheese and thats it
Did you know they converted the outside of a BK in san juan PR to promote the movie i passed while i was on vacation. It looks cool at night
Why is the bun red when it should be black and the sesame seeds should be red
I don’t think people are seeing it because of the burger tbh
I mean, it honestly doesn’t taste that bad.
just looking at the burger make me want to shit
Too late. XD
Anyone else caught off guard by the Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog music at 0:40 ?
Chill it’s part of the canon
bro i got the ad for the spider-verse burger
I ate it and LOVED it! It didn’t cause any problems and I even got it a second time.
Me who got a Burger King ad before the video 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
I can't believe that Burger King used actual Spider-Men from the Spider-Verse as the meat for the Spider-Verse Burger.
I've heard about it before... but if it's true, then how come it's not on the news that Talk about this spider-verse whopper put people in the hospital...
*I knew that shit was disgusting from a miles away*
i ate this burger and literally nothing happened these people are just trying to get attention.
Well either way, I didn’t try it cause I’m not a whopper person. I eat the Royal crispy sandwich, the original chicken sandwich and those good chicken fries. And I did watch the movie, it was good, still annoyed by the cliffhanger though. But luckily the next one is coming next year. Man it’s just like when they did the cliffhanger for the movie Avengers infinity war, it ended with half of the world disappearing and the sadness of losing their friends.
Probably tastes like the spider that made Spiderman himself
Benbros was on this first...
i cant wait for the whoppenheimer
OMG IM GONA PUKE🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮
Which is a lie
i ate it anyways
Bruh Jake Paul told,me
I ate one then took a radioactive shit.
Jameson be cursing andd ranting about spidey right about now.
I ate that whooper and it was good.
Whoever has eaten that burger I feel bad for you
I actually had this last week but thankfully nothing happened to me and I’m only learning this just now ☹️
Only one of the 2 burger kings in my area had it.
2000s backward
It Burger King what do people expect  There burgers is always bad
What the buns?
Oiiiiii
Bruh
Miles better come out with another apology video 😅😂
The buns look like watermelons
too late...
twist: it was an ordinary burger who got bit by a genetic-changing spider and he became the hero
Mmh strayberry burger
Don't Eat That Arrhhhg! AHHHHHH!!
1:22
Me and my mom went to see this movie yesterday
the burgerverse
There is nothing wrong with the spider verse burger, it is not dangerous. It is delicious and healthy, one of the best burger king menu, eat it  Very recommend ❤❤❤😢😅😊😂😂
Did you know, the red dye is actually beet juice, not red food dye
It's just red fruit coloring
Nah everyone would’ve cared even if they didn’t have the spider whopper
Burger king is now a canon marvel universe.
Fun fact: It’s actually beet juice that they use to color the burger. Not red food dye.
spiderman burger
probably full of fucking estrogen...
It felt like a trillion spiders coming into my mouth when I ate it💀
lolllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
the new burgers have theme travis scott burger: an edible that kills you bts burger: makes you addicted to liquid crack spiderverse whopper: seizures, time travel, personality change and 10% chance of death
i ate it but my burger king did not have red buns
Too late
Beetroot juice is used to make the red bun.
Aw man i didn't get a chance to eat it  I wanted some multiversle power in a buber
It Made Me Turn spider-man                                                                   @Burger King What The World
I’ve watched the movie 2 times now and don’t regret it😤
Is it bad that the thumbnail reminded me of what Lilmar did to that McChicken?
To late the web is in my stomach
The video doesn't load on 0:09 :(
Isn’t it weird that the bun looks like the inside of a watermelon and the main character in the movie is black 🤨
If its actually bad then i’ll see you on the other side
I had it and it only gave me green poop
I liked it
W Burger King for the tweet!
we need a chicken sandwich variation I Don't Eat Beef
Bur-Spider-gur wo-man-pper
It won't cause death and the burger is good  what you talking about
Havent been on your channel in a while lol. Sick new intro
What the buns ‼️
I love the RED 40 burger
Bu but even the tomatos are red
It to late I’m going to die and the bun felt like play dou
And to think i was so bummed that they didnt have it
im surprised people aren;t sucking the hamburgers dick like the movie
But nobody batted an eye when they turned the bun completely black for Halloween 🤡
Hell naw i never ate it 💀
Bro i ate this AND IT WASNT EVEN COLORED
Alexandra: Oh My God I Don’t Eat Spider-verse burger it’s not gonna kill me Its Not Good For Me And Unhealthy For Me Im Not Going To The Hospital Ever Again I’m Sorry Spider-verse Whopper Burger I Hate Burgers By Vailskibum
the sir we lost another one to the whopper killed me lmao
It looks disgusting
Wait this is real ☠️
But, it tastes good?
Thats why why my shop didnt sell that to me
Isn't that what burger king usually does to you?
For those who haven't tried the spiderverse whopper. Those aren't buns, they're *watermelon*
Never tried it.
I love how Valiskibum says Miles’ last name wrong
i already ate it help 💀
It was bad
i had the spider-verse chicken burger, and it still is the most delicious burger i've ever had
Don't tell me the odds.
Welp I luckily never ate it
1:32 | It's not horrible if it's true.
What the buns
It caused nausea hurt my stomach
Im glad i tried the burguer before the meme
I’m in Australia💀
"promise me spongebob to never eat at arbys"  -mrcrabs
It’s not even the burger that was showed in the movie (The blue burger with the spider symbol during the chase scene in the cafeteria)
as a person who ate the burger, i can confirm that i have died
we have black burger, buns, normal, and red soon will have the colorful burgers from SpongeBob
Me just seeing the title: No shit
The real reason is because there are so many *black spots* on that burger, no wonder.
This is the new Travis Scott meal
Yeah don’t eat the whopper. Just throw the whopper at the scientist instead of the bagel and see what happens.
Honestly, I don't know who would eat this. I mean, looks great. Don't give me wrong but I have no idea if it's good or not.
Ngl it was mid
This sows up in the movie
I tried the Spider Verse whooper and literally  I didn't have to go to the hospital
The Spider-Verse Whopper is the Original Anomaly! If it weren’t for it, then the Original Whopper wouldn’t have been burned! And I’m the only one who had to put it all together!   _…It doesn’t belong here…_
Yeah the red bun turned my whole skin red and I have got spider powers. And I’ve only ate it 2 times.
Is it poison?
Has anybody ate this before did they ever end up in the hospital?! 🏥
no way home if i digested it xd
"even the tomatoes are red!" carried Across the Spiderverse marketing. This was another big contribute
Burger King please removes it...
... *What?*
Bro I ate this and I was perfectly fine. L channel
For god sakes since when you don’t want the food reviewers to review that particular theme hmmm? @Vailskibum
i ayte it an it tsted like as$!!!!!!!1
This is the green burger king halloween Burger electric bogoloo
Just saw the movie with friends yesterday to celebrate our last day of freshman year, it was awesome.
red 40 delight 💀
It’s just a canon event
I bet that matpat is gonna make a food theory on this
that burger is ALL VEGETABLES
wth is the music he's playing near the end of the music? I just want to know because I'm going insane trying to remember what it was called/from
1:32 what do you mean horrible? they were right.
It features in the movie btw
It's like the black whopper bun fiasco all over again
Burger King never seemed to learn from their last mistake.  The Halloween whopper that had the black buns.
Oh... That's why I have so much anxiety after I ate it.
Wow Miles got two apology videos on his belt first one was for the baby shampoo and now for the burger.💀            Someone probably already made this joke but I’m still gonna use it.
Anyone remember the Halloween Whopper from years ago?
1:32 wait it has 666k likes?
Eat it. Its delicious.
Burger King put a damn radioactive spider in my burger and now i got Randy Marsh worth of cancer on my balls.
I ate it yesterday and it tasted amazing
I had a sneaking suspicion, especially when you remember that they did a Halloween burger that was black, and it had the same results as this little spider-burger.
I ate it.
Only in America are food regulations so bad, companies are allowed to use artificial dyes like this in food.
Rest in peace🚽🪠
rest in peace, whopper burger..
Now this takes me back to when that one guy ate two of them and got hospitalized☠️
OOHHH that was a red bun, I actually thought it was a Watermelon bun and was hinting at sone racist stuff.
I ate the Spider-Verse Burger
It says online that red 40 gives you ADHD, like how tf can u get a neurological disorder from estrogen food 💀
Bro I tried it and it was sooo good my guy!!
My stomach is sticky now :(
I’m 10 years old and even I know that this burger is not good
It gave me a Like super diarrhea
As a burger king manager a fun little fact the red bun is achieved using beet juice same as the red goldfish that exist within goldfish colors however I have yet to look into the seeds stay tuned for more inside info
Club penguin skull emoji
“Let’s take something unhealthy and put red food coloring in it.👍”   I’m glad it’s giving the movie more attention though😂
I always thought pretty patty were macaroons???
1:25 mf doom
I was never gonna try it☠️
Sadly we don’t have spider man in Canada Toronto the burgers
Dw bro, me eating the burger is a canon event
💀
thats funny cuz thats the same burger miles morales stepped on while he was running away from the other spidermen.
I actualy had food poisoning from eating I don’t find this funny but keep this in mind that I got food poisoning from it
💀
Lets be honest other burgerking in other countrys taste better than america version
There is a reason why they made the burger look like a watermelon
Its all fun and games until Mcdonalds or Dairy Queen gets a Transformers theme on the Big Mac or Blizzard flavour
It’s that Halloween whopper all over again. But it’s better (thats my opinion so you could not like it that’s okay if you don’t like it)
It won’t happen man stop making me nerves about eating tha5 whopper again
I ate 3 of these. And I’m still OK.
Me: what it cant be that bad Me after: 💀
I hope it tastes like Spider-Man
Peter B Parker said it best. Never invest in a Spider-Man themed restaurant.
Sad that people paid a lot of money to see half a movie *shrug*
thank the lords it didnt turn your poop into a different color
I got a Freddy’s ad from watching this. 👁👄👁
Watermelon burger.
It really  made me through up a spider web 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Yeah ill probably buy the red burgee
Too late
Fun fact : at the end of the secret wars comics,miles saves the multiverse by giving somone a burger,i am not joking
Reminds me when i tried the black bun Halloween whopper
Red 40
Eating it Will Send Your Stomach *Across The SpiderVerse*  Ha get it oh sorry😂
I HAD ONE FUCCKKKKK
Y'all some haters
I ate it I'm alive.
I watched the movie but i fell asleep
It was a multiverse in my mouth
I ate it, it was chill
I ate the burger, and all it did was excite my tongue!
I remember went to McDonald’s and I thought about getting it, but I didn’t want to. because it looked gross. Have a good day! ❤
I remember went to McDonald’s and I thought about getting it, but I didn’t want to. because it looked gross. Have a good day! ❤
Guys you get spider powers after you eat the burger
Wasn’t planning on it
I ate this burger and got chokeslammed through a cement floor by spider-man 2099, 0/10 Would not recommend.
I ate an orange ghost pepper whopper on Halloween _last online Oct 31 2022_
BRO even the CEO of Ohio ate it like ham 💀💀💀
Melon Burger
Don't eat a double spiderverse whopper. It sends you to the hospital bed.
It was good i had no lettuce on it but the only thing that caused me trouble was the cheese it didn't go well with my Lactose intolerants the bathroom has no way home now
It's like pretty patties but it's kinda fatal.
luckily!!!! i didint get anything but a stable crown. so thats good
My Burger King ran out of them
I'm not watching the spiderverse I rather watch villainous and admire black hat
Wait, why is the bun mainly red?!  Miles' suit is mainly black with red highlights, not the other way around!
How is burger king so good at advertising lmao
They probably just cut Miles in half and told us that it's a burger, or maybe it's like a test to check if you're Spider-Man!
As someone who just watched across the spider verse, I love the part where the spider verse whopper showed up and said "It's whoppin time" and (spoilers) was a whopper
Waah! I can’t eat the Spider-Man’s buns!!!! 😭
even the tomatoes is red
wait are they using Watermelons for Buns?
It’s literally a Whopper with food coloring. I had 2 of them— wait… why can my hands cling to walls?
Memes gain movies viewers? Monsoon is right! Memes are the DNA of the soul!
Tbh I just want to go Burger King just to see the decorations
Actually it is deadly for a friend of mine, he's allergic to red food dye
I watched the movie yesterday with my school.
Idk about you but I really liked the burger it was pretty good
I just watch the movie I'm mind in  absolutely blown
Roast example for red whopper: Ladybug looking.
Well, it turns out I was not the only one who thought the spider verse whopper was weird
1:10 no wonder what happened in GOTG 3
i tried it a few weeks ago and i liked it, so idk whats going on, i didnt get sick but i think some people dont like beetroot juice so maybe thats why.
What's wrong with the new burger and I did not know a lot of people end up at the hospital for eating a burger even my friend even got one
Man, I wanted to eat the spider-verse whopper, but the bk I usually go to said they don't sell it anymore and it passed me off so I left and now I know why, too many people bought the burger thus selling it out the burger  *angry growling noises* 👿 🤬
I don't know why, but this video and your recent one about Pixar's lay-offs don't work on my Smart TV. For some reason, certain videos will just freeze and never continue.
The spider verse burger is good, even if I had to go to the hospital to keep living.
Or what? I'm still gonna eat it
The Cause if these Memes are Because People Confused the “Red 40” Food Dye. When the Whopper used Beet Juice to color the Whopper’s Buns.
Got it and my bun was Orange
Burger King W
spy bug are is so evil.,.,,.
Let's run it back one last time. My name is Pedro Parker. I bit the bk spiderverse burger and for the last two an a half hours ive been spewing out more lava than an active volcano. but no matter how much i flush i still keep wiping
Why did I predict this would happen
I ate it, the universe didn't end, it must be a canon event
my dad telling me that we would watch the new spider verse movie cuz i got an A in maths
Sesame seeds are watermelon seeds
eh no i wont watch it , it may be good but i dont like super popular stuff
The Bk closest to my domicile was shut down😤
eating this burger will make you black
just like the Spiderman's backstory but this time you died instead of your beloved one
tbh i never knew of the whopper BUT already planned to see the movie
It ain’t available outside the USA. Could’ve mentioned that dude.
When I ate it it felt like spider man was coming in my mouth
If a health inspector comes to Burger King and tries it they are going to shut Burger King down.
I eat the whopper nothing happened
my mum said she absolutely hated spiderman into the spiderverse, every second of it, so she forced me to watch the disney remake of little mermaid. dude i really wish i could see the movie, if it ever goes on regular tv or max if it doesn't and the little mermaid is on disney+ i'm going to be mad at my mother for doing such diabolical decisions for choosing the movie she likes, but not me or my sister.
I loved the spider whooper
The person seeing the kid on the floor: hmm maybe I should call for help nahh let’s take a snap and post on YouTube 😂
They say spider verse woppers  but what i see is the pretty Patty's from spongebob.
first time i have ever heard the emoji movie and minions rise of gru mentioned in the same sentence as spiderverse
I started the video and thought i got a burger king add and was all like what a coincidence 🤦‍♂️
Who the heck thought of the red whopper for spider man? There are plenty of other options. Like..... um... well, idk.
Saw this right after getting the burger👁️👄👁️
It felt like many spiders were in my mouth
What happend to the racoon💀
Is it just me or does Burger King now that their products will turn into memes and make them more money?
What The Buns?! Was That Spider Man?  Edit: They Copied Kracc Bacc Thumbnail!
It won’t but it will result in a one way trip to the bathroom.
Well my cousin is dead now bec he really say ur will die
Good stuff 👍
I ate it twice in the same week and none of this shit happened to me.
Mmmcookies
The fact i had a ad about the whopper ☠️☠️
No Spiderman burger would be complete without spiderpig bacon on top. Mmmm. Taste the porky spider.
Spiderman is trash
GUYs there all out of Spider-Man whopers
warn people before the flashing, epilepsy dude.
Its gonna send you to the spiderverse in the sky 😇
If there's no real health hazard from trying that Whopper (other than the whole "fast food isn't healthy" thing of course), I'm definitely gonna try it.
If I had a nickel for every time Miles Morales having a burger be important, I would have 2. Which isn’t a lot but is crazy it happend twice.
Was anyone thinking of pretty patties on SpongeBob when they first saw this burger?
Ate the red whopper Boutta become a multiversal threat rq
it would've been a bit better if it had a white bun with black sesame seeds to represent Spot
Should’ve banned or discontinued the burger
Eaten like 4, not at once or on the same day lol.  It’s good, but it’s a whopper so you know what you’re getting but honestly the star is not the red bun, it’s the Swiss cheese!
I got a Spanish McDonald’s ad on this vid.
Dude, even the tomatoes are red🙄🙄
i think i'm dying, i have eaten it twice, help meeeeeeeee
Remember the Halloween Whopper?
I ate this burger twice and let me be honest,This Thing May Look Disgusting,But It Tastes Absolutely Normal!  Don’t believe what you hear..
I ate it and I didn't feel sick after also it was alright
Looks good I wish I could try it
It’s colored with beets
ima go eat it nom-  ⚰☠
Tried it myself and it was really good, albeit really just being a whopper with some different ingredients and different color buns. Didn’t have any issues with my stomach afterwards. The Burger King I live by is pretty high-quality for being a typical fast food chain so the texture, taste and appearance was pretty decent, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it was soggy or messy for other people lol. Don’t believe everything on the internet. You’ll be fine eating this burger.
Welcome To The Whopper-Verse.
Me: A red bun burger? Hmm.....seems sus to me. Nah it's probably okay, it's probably just beetroot coloring. *eats burger* *gasp* ☠
Knew it.
1:39 it’s not dyes it’s natural color from veggies
I must be dead already, because I had the burger yesterday
Miles: Black This burger: The buns look like cut up watermelons Am I the only one sensing something here?
I knew it THIS ALWAYS HAPPENS
Dw I won’t it’s $9
i want to watch it again
I thought if you eat the spider verse spider Whopper, you would turn into Spider-Man.
2:10 I love it when videos show AiAi from Super Monkey Ball
“Even the tomatoes is red bro”
They better bring the whoppers back when Beyond the Spider-Verse comes out
Seriously? Why not? It actually doesn't look too bad, so I mean, I'd eat it, ngl, honestly! Come on, bro! Eat it! Eat it! Eat it! Eat it! Come on! Marvel and Sony did a great promotional stunt by having this burger be sold at Burger King and go see ATSV, it's a nice promotion, man! They did a really nice job with that!
3am youtubers be like.
It's nothing special and it's the same bun that was used for the Halloween ghost burger
Seriously made me sick. I had it the night of the movie and while on the theater. It doesn’t taste good at all.
Its fake i ate and im still standing
Well no poop the raccoon died the buns are not suitable for animals 1:10
Guess we should have listened to Peter B, don't invest in a spider themed restaurant
I ate it lol. It's just a regular whopper with a red bun.
Its just the internet once again being cancel culture and trying to scare the hell outta people only for it to result in them making themselves look like idiots like the people who predict the end of the world are doing
Don't Eat Red Whopper That Give You Blue Poop
Don't scare me like i ea two of those things already 😂
kumala kumala kumala saveta
Our Burger King got set on fire by a lightning strike. We unfortunately do not get to have this once in a lifetime stomach disaster.
They ran out. Never got to eat one.
Wow always gotta be people like this 😪
Damn I wish I live in America to try this :/
Not much of a whopper person but just saw the movie and now I can't say no
My sister watched this movie yesterday at the theatre, so i should definitely check this movie out and watch it
But I ate it, and nothin happened, so don’t believe anything you see on the internet.  Edit: Nevermind, it was a joke ig
I already ate 2! Noooooooooo!
Hey what about the baskin robins?  Oh and I’m sad because in my country kuwait the movie release in. 22 of June and I’ve got spoiled like 11-18 times from the release and it has only been 2 DAYS
I tried the spiderverse burger and it was really good...............djaojoguaoghuhfduayd
what the buns moment
I renember the hallween burger from burger king i think it was
Okay, but the Spider-Verse burger actually looks appetizing. I mean, I wouldn't want to risk going to the hospital after taking a single bite out of it, but still.  But if you think that's crazy, just wait 'till you see what Burger King's been doing in Japan...
Mr. crabs after eating a spider verse burger: "don't do it mr. Squidward"
guess in dead
Well it won’t cause death of couse if u eat it u will die if u eat any food u will die eventually
I tried it and I felt fine
You lying. With great buns come great beef. JUSTICE, FOR GOTHAM. (Sorry wrong franchise)
Does this mean Sony wants people to eat it and go to the hospital 💀💀
1:30 When the f*** did that happen!?
Molecule man: Hmmmmm, what a nice burger.
this can send you to a dimension to a magical word.
Universal !
Bruh i wish this was in Australia
Never eat it, I remember the Halloween whopper and it wasn't good with that red sauce and....   Doesn't kill you put you will feeling going to the bathroom notice it's Blue.
Note: They don't use food coloring for the color of the buns, they use beetroot juice instead!
so at the end of the movie- wait who are you peop- HELP!! HELP!!!! AHHH!!!!
In all honesty, Sony picked _the_ worst burger chain to partner with.
I already tried the brand new Spider-Verse Whopper on Friday with the Spider-Verse cup and it didn't give me any issues. Plus, I thought it was going to be spicy because of the redness of the bun, but I was disappointed it was just a regular plain old Whopper. Other than that, I'm glad I gave it a try. =3
When I ate the whopper I glitched out, shot webs out of my butthole, could shrink, and can stick to walls. The worst whopper in my life
They removed the burger. As soon as the movie came out so like what the f
Isn't it like the Halloween Whopper?
I want the cup
me want red 40 borgar
Well, I’m pre diabetic now so I can’t… and I don’t think I want to. Never been a Burger King fan… I’m more of a Wendy’s kind of person.
You know this reminds me of the black whopper
They don’t use food dye to give it the red color, they use beets!
I don't have money 😭😭😭😭😭 But if i did, i would have re-watched 20 times by now
So,does this exclusive burger available on Malaysia????
i live in australia and eat mcdonald's so this means nothing to me.
it would've been better is they memed that they become a Spider Hero
I don’t get it what is happening did the buns made people go to the hospital
it was a good burger
This has the same energy as the morbius burger
Bro I remember we were in class watching a movie on yt and this ad pulled up and me and my friend next to me could not for our lives stop laughing because i said and I quote It looks like someone had a period on my cheeseburger
“If you’ve already seen it, go watch it again.” Nah now that I know it’s a cliffhanger I’d rather not waste my time with what feels like an unfinished plot. Sony stretching out stories once again. Just like they’re doing with the Final Fantasy 7 Remake games. Smh
Bro this thing looks like a watermelon buger.
Why the fuck did they make that weak ass burger Bru 💀
The spider verse whopper doesn’t have to do something with death
Craig of the creek is back
I’m gonna go see it again
It’s already sus when the red buns exist ngl😊 (and it’s as of this burger ar everywhere)
I love Burger King and think it’s a fast food goat but I am 100% not eating that
Just a little fun fact, the red coloring isn't the red food die that is not safe to eat but instead is accutully red beet juice!
I REALLY WANT TO TRY THIS WHOPPER SO BAD! BECAUSE MY STOMACH IS STARVING!
It’s pretty good
Me who just got back from seeing it and him telling me to go see it again: IGHT BET THAT MOVIE 🔥🔥🔥
Unfortunately it was sold out when I was trying to get one.
0:00
bk massacred my boy miles morales.
This is why I don't like burger king anymore.
Spiderverse doesn't need food adretisement  No one says "oh yeah I heard about this movie when I ordered a whopper at Burger King"
Holy shit!! At some point I was gonna eat it when I felt like eating Burger King you just saved almost everyone's life here
why is this #26 on trending
Don’t invest in a Spider-Man themed burger
The idea was better in there head
Bro this really brings me back and when they decided to bring out the black Burger I remember it like yesterday because my cousin ate that thing
This burger 🍔 is apparently Dangerous. Don't eat this burger Guys!
I find it looks tasty
Too late you should’ve made this video beforehand IVE ALREADY CONSUMED THE WHOPPER!
I KNEW AT SOME POINT SOON THAT THE INTERNET WOULD START BITCHING OVER THE SPIDER-VERSE BURGER !!
Too late :/
Why does everyone hate the Spider-Verse Whopper? It’s actually really good
My cousin ate it and he got diarrhea for a week 💀
Im glad I didn't
This means that the whopper guy can cross multiverses, he is unstoppable
Thank god the Burger King I went to didn’t have the red buns
i ate a burger and im fine
I think people are doing this because of the Halloween Whopper BK had several years back where they had a black bun. I've heard that it caused people to have green stools after eating it, so I guess since BK is doing something like that again, people wanted to joke around with that.
Modern SpongeBob is complete and utter garbage
Bruv thats gonna slip u the worst perc 💀
The whopper is probably still gonna be colder than ice...  Burger kings here are absolutely bad and cannot be redeemed cuz even if it is cook to order, it can make people swell. Generally I'd say don't eat any kind of whopper if you notice any problems after.
Gotta love misinformation for clicks lmfao. Where's your "don't breathe air" video for the microplastics and C02 we breathe in via pollution daily? Or is that just not a hot button topic yet?
Oh my God... The AI song's, the memes of the burger.... It's literally all part of Burger King's marketing strategy plan. You know they even made a video explaining that they're happy people are making memes about their company... That was from the AI music videos alone
they even made the tomatoes red. 10/10 for me
American vomit fest. 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 I’m nauseous hearing this
What if you eat it with pink sauce?
1:30 Based BK
Even the tomatoes are red bruh
Ever eat this cursed burger
Too late
Saw it on the 1st and seeing it again Tuesday.  Haven't bought the Whopper meal yet though.
I love how miles in the thumbnail making the face like he knew the spiderverse burger doesn't taste good
Burger King has been landing all the positive memes lately
Watermelon burger 😂 🍉 🍔
So happy that it made $120M due to the burgers!
I got got an ad for the spider verse whopper before this video, no joke
Burger is almost as bad as the movie so it makes sense
oh
The moment so I heard about I said Hell no.
I ate it and i fine
Looks more like a Ladybug burger
It has Swiss cheese on it too
You're too late. I ate the burger. 🍔 *SPOILER ALERT* It wasn't bad.
Who bets that burger king will do this again next year
When I was ordering the spider verse burger but instead they give me an regular burger. 😭
i didn’t want to eat it anyways
I eat it and love it
My friend ate it.
They made a green burger not too long ago with green food coloring for Halloween
I ate the spider verse whopper once nothing happened.      Slumbeeeeeerr that brother gone 🗣️💯🔥💀
I had horrible gas last time
I got the spider verse burger and it wasn’t even red 😭
I ate it
I couldn’t get the burger, I was sad, but after hearing this, I am a-okay!
Did Burger King forget the Halloween Whopper
SPOILER ALERT AHEAD        Why would I want to watch a part 1 of a movie again not even a week after release
Thank God we don't have that thing
What happened to Miraculous Ladybug?
new spider verse movie look eh
I just got fired from burger king over a month ago and now I’m happy it happened 😊 2:49
I just got fired from burger king over a month ago and now I’m happy it happened 😊
Just like pink sauce ;-;
When I ate it it felt like a million spiders cumming in my mouth
So do you want us to eat it or not?
Note to self, do not eat burger with colored buns
This just reminds me of that one time McDonalds had a black bun burger
Too late I already ate it
I thought that burger would be spicy, instead it just sent me to the toiletverse
My sister ate the burger and glitched into another dimension
I knew this would happen, based on the Halloween whopper
I didn’t even get my cup…
I ate it and it was ok
I’m so glad my town never got these at any of its BK locations  .
I had the burger. It was alright
The movie was great. I saw on day of release and wasn't spoiled any way on the movie. Had the burger two or three times up to this point. I like it. It's nothing special but just a nice variation
Iv had it several times, I was fine. 🙂
The thing that would go with the tittle sentience is dont eat the spider verse whopper at 3am
Red 40💀
Only in America
Ankle
Id like to have one spi⚰
Good thing it was out of stock when I tried to get one after seeing the movie in theaters.
Now I wanna find out what it tastes like
What were they thinking?
2:12 Nice Super Monkey Ball references!
this burger is so good i have 3 for dinner last week
I gotta be honest, this is the first I'm hearing of this burger.
this happened before, the black buns, its been years
Y’all never learned from the Halloween whopper
Too late
I ate this whopper last month, I actually thought it was pretty good, and I really liked it
Bro, Sony chose to team up with a good chain to promote their movie and they picked...Burger King?  Why didn't they somewhere like Wendy's, that would've been so much better Edit: I bought it just to try it and I didn't even get the special cup
even the tomatoes are red
The color scheme doesn’t remind me of Miles, black buns and red sesame seeds would
Literally just saw it, was good as hell bruh.
There’s a balance between memes and dreams people.
Why is it a watermelon
Yesterday I went, glad I didn’t order it though
Spider verse burger is something I never wanted to try
I love red 40!
I got my powers by eating a radioactive burger.
I soonest I saw this I got flashbacks to the Addams family burger
I had it and I was fine
Going to go grab one now.
This reminds me of the black whopper the one that made your poop green
"Miles Moraleese"
I had a spider verse whopper and it uncle ben’d my stomach :(
I bet you to trillion dollars that there’s an alternate time line where uncle Ben ate a spider verse whopper
The one time I actually want to have the meal and cup, and it's not available in Canada. 😭 Why must everything only be in the US?
Nigga
At least it's not dangerous  Unlike the squid ink burger a few years ago that actually did cause food poisoning
"YOU BELONG IN THE KITCHEN!" - Arthur Morgan
I Ate and Tried The Spider-Verse Whopper and Kept The Cup and Crown  It Was Pretty Good and Didn’t Have a Problem
The add for this burgers ruin the movie for me
called it
I actually thought this was gonna be a spicy burger because it's red
red poop
I felt The Spot inside of me when I ate it. Would not recommend.
made a spider come out of my web 💀
that’s not across the spider verse, that’s across the medical ward
Too late. Already ate it. Was tasty though! 🤤😋
Even so, it will never compare to McDonalds Sprite
I’m going to watch spider man across the spider verse later today👍
Remindes me of that black cheese burger they made that one time in October
I swear this is the pink sauce trend all over again
so........its a joke? The burger dosnt really kill u? ......do ppl like,, wanna die? Or sending off a message in a comedic way that fast food will kill you? And why just this burger? Im not getting the joke
I would like to try this whopper.
Burger King: Time to make peoples stomach to bazerk
0:13 please dont tell me they said what the bun AND red bun
What's next the UNICRON CHAOS REAPER BK BURGER sponsered by the evil Decepticons from the Transfromers Rise of the Beast ? 🐲🐲🐲
Fun Fact: They Actually Used Beetroot Juice To Make The Buns Red Not Red Food Coloring
Wtf
Last time I had Burger King, it came out at both ends.
My town got rid of the only Burger King we had which sucks now becuase the Spider-verse whooper looks cool.
i ate it💀
WHY DIDNT YOU TELL ME A WEEK AGO
tomato’s red too 😮
1:44 COME ON STEP IT UP!
I mean at least it's not the black whopper again right
Thinking about seeing it next weekend. Even tho I just went to the movies last weekend. But theres a lot of movies I wanna see right now.
Spider -man acroos the explosive diarrhea
This looks similar to the black buns that Burger King did a few years ago
What the what is from gumball😂
Even the tomatoes are red 💀
My brother told me not to eat it it’s bad
can you try not to make usless videos like this? is it that hard?
Don’t eat the spider verse whopper or you’re gonna end up like uncle Ben
I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again. The buns look like a watermelon 💀
Didn’t Burger King color a whopper before and had THE SAME thing happen? It was like a Frankenstein whopper or something. It was green or blue and made people sick
I knew the diabetes would come
Commentary youtuber 😎😎😎
Way ahead of you. That thing looked more like a Nasty Patty than a Pretty Patty.
This is the worst movie I have been waiting when the first trailer came out TO MAKE ME WAIT UNTIL NEXT YEAR JUST TE FREAKING WATCH THE NEXT PART
I wanted it but the person at the counter said it was "discontinued"??? They just stopped making it??
I was so excited for the fight and then see "TO BE COINTINUED" 💀💀💀💀💀
when i ate it it felt like a million spiders came inside me
1;17 whats the music this guy used
Eating it feels like a bunch of spiders are coming in my mouth
In other words, angriest whopper without any of the spice
Too late
even the tomatoes are red
Bro I'm eating the spider verse whopper now
Comment 1000

After I saw the movie I will actually get the Whopper.
I haven't watched the movie yet, because im planning to watch it when it becomes summer. 11 more days!!!
Dont think Im missing that Murder of Sonic OST no sir no sir no sir!!!
💀
It wasnt so bad, i still ate it "my way" but the red buns did have a different texture and slight flavor from the usual. I still hope we get green/purple ketchup again one day
remember the infamous black bun halloween whopper?  i wonder what will happen with the red buns.
I literally just had the burger earlier and I feel fine
Too late😬
The burger doesn’t fit the movie :(
Lol
Nah I broke  the rules because I ate 10 of them in one sitting while watching and I so far feel fine
I ate it, and I’m not de-
Failed successfully
The bun looks like a watermelon
Whoever ate this burger must've said whats up danger?
3 spider verse whoppers versus 3 taco bell items
I saw this coming, especially because it's fucking burger king
I ate the spider-verse burger and nothing bad happened to me
It's perfectly fine so long as you remove the sun dried tomatoes.
RIP to all the little Timmy's who ate the whopper after the movie. They will truly be remembered. 🙏🙏🙏🙏😭😭😭
This has to be a joke because I am not following for no tricks ps  yeah it’s true it does?
Aw man a silly boy Connor verse inside my tummy is happening🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Tictoc needs to be deleted
I’m all for watching the SpiderVerse movie again
people are just weird tbh thanks to tiktok
I ate it and I’m still alive, stop being a baby
I read the title and was like oh shit I already ate two.
idk I ate it and I survived
seeing this right after I just ate one, going to see the movie tomorrow
This is the black whopper all over again. But meme form.
Me who tried to get it yesterday.
S P I D E R  M A N  F O O T  L E T T E C E
I already had the spider burger and nothing happened to me. F*** you death!🚫☠️ You didn't get me! HA😜😝
I love burger King but that whopper looks disgusting
I knew there was something sus about that burger
What is this
I was about to eat one but an alternate version of myself came out of a portal telling me to not eat it, and that it’s dangerous. He then snatches it, has a grin on his face and right before jumping in the portal, he said “I’m actually you in a future of a time line where I didn’t get the chance to eat one of these sucker.”  F**k me(pause) right, anyways I gotta time travel to the past to get one from my younger self.
OK I will put it on God I want to go purchase the Spider-Man burger from Burger King and I puked that day and my dad picked it up didn’t know why you need to hear that but on God I puked on that day I ate the burger my stomach did not feel very well, and all I know is that the burger taste like a whopper but just watch different😊
Fake
Wouldn't it make more sense for the Spider-Verse burger to have black buns with red food-coloured sesame seeds?
Watermelon Whopper.
I’ve had it twice and I’m completely fine👍
Fun fact: Burger King by their rules don’t allow any food dyes in their meals, so realistically this burger’s red color actually had come from red beet juice!
The Spider-Verse sundae is actually pretty good (And I'm not even a fan of ice cream
oh god
wow even the tomatos are red 💀
Strawberry Bun 💀
me still: but i want to shit every 5 minutes :(
Too late I ate it last week
5 years ago, McDonald's made a happy meal from Into the Spiderverse but now there is no McDonald's in the sequel, but Buguer King brought us a red hamburger.
💀
I have had 3 I am a ghost now
I have had 3 I am a ghost now
Guys, you DONT NEED TO PROMOTE IT ITS SPIDERVERSE TWO
Miles be like: "I made a third mistake"
The only thing it could do to you is Green Poop.
Ladybug Burger?
The spiderverse whopper Is not Going to kill me....cuz the buns are Red dye food coloring.🍔❤
I ate it and I felt okay, then again I did eat a hostess lemon fruit pie which expired 7yrs ago and nothing happened-I guess I have a superpower 😄
I’m gonna try one soon I gotta before it goes
Why did they choose burger king 😔
Just like Halloween 2015, and the Black Bun, Another disaster happened
when i first saw it i instantly knew that thing would remake st helens
I thought this was suppose to be good.
killer,killer,killer killet.junior,double,evil killer.even thou all killers are evil,the evil one is worst
I think it depends on how your body is and the Burger King you get it. The conditions of the Whopper could very much impact how your stomach can digest it. For me personally, I ate the burger while having some issues with my stomach and the thing is I ate it right before bed so my stomach was hurting the whole night and next day.
I think rhis meme is supposed to be funny. That sign meaning  it the most best burger they ever taste it. Lol. And they find away to make peole go see the movie. That was a very smart move. Now it make sense why the movie beat the super Mario movie.
it looks like a watermelon
Bro doesn’t know these are all memes lmao. Nothing in the burger would be harmful. The buns are dyed with beet roots so the only thing I could guess is if someone was allergic to beets
You know the movies good when vailskibum tells yo7 to watch it
When I had my Spider-Verse whooper, it was fine. Just a regular whopper with red buns and black sesame seeds. I didn’t get a chance to have the sundae though
what a pointless video. why even bother
1:42 It’s unhealthy because *it has red 40 in it*
Really dude? You couldn’t say whopper in the title?
If red food dye increases the risk of cancer 40 years in the future no one will sue burger king as they can't pin point them as the cause. Just stay away from artifical food coloring, it does nothing but add hazards and you lose nothing without it.
Word has it CIA operatives are now carrying these on them in case they get captured and need to “end it” quickly.
Sometimes a negative can be a positive
I tried it, and it doesn’t taste that good. Super dry
I ate it and i felt the spiders coming inside of my mouth. It then made me lay spider eggs in the toilet
I thought we had another Pokeball suffocation incident
Wait, so they just faked their heart attack about the hamburger or, they actually had an actual pain about because, my mom wants to try a new burger but, if it is a real thing, then ill tell her tgat were nit buying a burger
I was *never* allowed to eat Burger King according to my dad, so yeah. Also, I'm from Canada.
I going ot this movie with my brother tonight. If this whooper is at my local Burger King, then I might try it out. I think I have a pretty strong stomach, so I should be fine.
My brother ate it
The whopper is safe to eat.
There was no way home when I ate the spider verse whopper
I work at Burger King and the bun is just beet juice there’s no red food dye
I ate it an it was surprisingly good
I got the burger but they didnt have the red buns😭😭
People are making food out of eVerything brah 💀😭
i did and it was just a whopper but red and it was still good
Watermelon whopper  Strawberry whopper
Ate the spider-verse burger day one. Ngl, it was pretty good(without onions at least).
The cup is paper I thought it was plastic, I like Burger King it’s good imo only thing wrong was that the bun was dry the Halloween one was way better
Spider Man Into The Digestive System.
Me seeing this after i watch the movie
I want to see this movie but my family and I are faced with an economic crisis, money problems Taxes and what not!
I mean, I ate the burger almost a month ago, and I feel perfectly fine. 🫤 Memes are memes, not news
This is Too Long for the Internet
I actually tried that exact Whopper and I was fine
I ate it but im still alive
Im gonna watch the movie today
I was fine after eating it
i legit thought i got a burger king Ad
As a brother that works here they are awesome go to Burger King!!
I got a burger king ad 💀
From what i have seen BK is using beet juice as a dye instead of red40
Ok
I watched it twice, back to back! I love it so much! 😂
I already ate the burger a couple days ago... it was actually pretty good! Although I can't stop spraying silk from my body
I don’t like hamburger anyways
Damn that’s crazy   * eats spider verse burger +
1:11 NOT ROCKET RACCOON (People who watched volume 3 will get it)
Im staying away from it..
I ate the spider burger when i watched the movie, now im crawling on walls.
That burger never seemed appealing to me
Offcourse you should not eat it.  It,s made by Burger King. 🤮
Welp this is going to be just like the black burger again
I have a sleeve of the Spider-Man cups in my room lol I work there
Good thing, I don’t eat burgers 🍔😖
Wdym? Spider man is grabbing for it in the thumbnail?
Ok is nobody going to talk about how that looks like a water melon.... 💀sus lol
My firends and I where supposed to eat that burger before watching the movie in theaters, but they where sold out again. But it shouldn't cause anyone to have stomach problems.
ooh i didnt know it was out. If i didnt get sued by a greedy mega cooperation for being a few days late for rent id def watxh it 😅
THOSE VERSES ARE MAKEIN IT OUT OF THE SPIDER VERSE 🔥🔥🤑🤑🥶🥶🤑🥶🔥🔥🔥🤑🥶
The whole reason across the spiderverse happened was because of a bagel.
Dude what was your point of saying don’t eat the whopper and saying it’s a joke ?
I have been trying to see this movie since it came out…. But every time I go, the entire theater is sold out of every showing
That burger did not make me gain Spider-Man’s powers.
I had the burger, Nothing happened, But I did have constipation for 3 days straight,  maybe there right.
Pretty sure going to the hospital because of the Spider-Verse Whopper is (SPOILERS!) a canon event. Don’t invest in a Spider themed burger.
I’m sure the burger caused a big multiverse in my stomach   Btw I’m glad  I didn’t eat the whopper
Burger King wasn’t my favorite place to eat a burger.
thank goodness I didn't die
Me whos had see already 👀👀👀👀👀
I eat the spider burger and nothing happened to me I'm just keep getting bitches every day for some reason 💀💀💀                    Joke btw
one week too late 😭
Now ik why it is so madness to eat the spiderverse whopper
I thought the Spider Verse burger would cause diarrhea.
Is the Multiverse Whopper a US exclusive because I can't find it in my region
Me who ate it:💀
Wait so it has red dye? Like food colouring?
Ironically I was red-y (🥁) to buy the burger, they didn't gave it cuz they said that they ran out of the red buns  I did get the cup tho which was my true goal
mfw vailskibum shamelessly clickbaits for the millionth time
From a universe where BK kills people
There's a good chance this whole meme might make it's way into the sequel.
Burger King added Spider Venom into the burger. That's why people are dying in the hospital and Burger king should be banded cuz McDonald's is more superior in my opinion
They ran out of the spidey buns so i was obly able to eat a regular whopper but called it a spidey burger
I had 2 of them and im fine not in pain not at a hospital 100% fine
I thought it was gonna be the whole black burger thing and turn people's poop red
I ate it and I was perfectly fine
Honestly, Burger King hasn’t been edible is years 🤢
I don’t eat Burger King but this looks unhealthy even for Burger King.
This feels like the Halloween whopper all again
32598th
Here in Brazil the spiderverse burger just has a spider web pattern on the top of the buns instead of red buns, which I guess is a step up?
Buger King, what have you done?!? You've poisoned all of these people!
I got a burger king ad going into this video 💀
This is so dumb, this is literally spreading misinformation. It would’ve been a much funnier meme if people acted like they got spider powers from the burger (I know you’ll call me out by saying, “bUt IsN’t ThAt mISinFoRmAtiOn?!1”, and to that I say, ask yourself what’s less-believable and more intentionally humorous, going to the hospital from eating a burger or developing super powers from eating a burger?)
Based on the thumbnail I thought they used red dye number fourty. If you don't know rd40 container beneze a cancer causing substance. Petition to ad rd40 to the miles morales whopper for the memes
I ate it
ordered this shit on doordash and didn't even get a red bun, just blew up my nearby BK for this shit
Btw, you can't trust every TikTok
So, the reason that people are actually "dying" is because of a waste of money? Well, I can relate to that.
Yesterday night in maryland, I was starving that my I wanted to go to Burger King, I was hyped for the spider man burger but the employee said that there was no red bun, I decided to eat it and I think it’s good to recommend but doesn’t kill you.
I ate it, pretty good
It literally looks like something from the Krusty Krab lol
I had two, and I was fine lol
How about a venom whaper
the death is that ur poop is red
0:14 was that the club penguin skull?
1:10 Aw hell nah! Rocket Racoon done ate the Spider-Verse Burger!
I ALSO saw a hundai ad of spider verse, miles is collaborating with everything!!
I've missed 2002 spiderman
The thing looks like a watermelon
WARNING: DO NOT EAT ANY BURGER THAT HAS COLORED BUNS AT BURGER KING OR EVER OR YOU'RE SUFFER THE REPERCUSSIONS!!!
weird ass watermelon
I know a guy that knew a guy that met a guy who ate a whopper and... Bad things! Bad things lots of bad things are happening they happening to him.
Rip raccoon
1:42 I heard somewhere it's actually beet juice
"Don't invest in a Spider-themed restaurant" -Peter B. Parker
People are just now discovering about red40 and are just freaking out about it, couple months ago it was micro plastics, and now nobody talks about it lol. Next couple months it'll be something new.
bro right when i saw the spider whopper i literally thought, “oo, pretty patty!”
I guess the burger caused several people to “glitch” like in the movie
I think there watching me because I got an Burger King ad before the video started
Look I don’t believe some of internet memes even this one while it’s funny, it’s just doesn’t make sense and can be annoying sometimes. Honestly
Didn’t they do this for spider-man 3? They had a black bun. Right?
I've heard people say it's spicy, some say it's a regular burger. And worker's saying they just changed the buns but I'm still gonna try it anyway
TBH I enjoyed that Spiderverse whopper
2020: Covid-19 2021: Covid-19 Delta-Variant 2022: N O T H I N G ! 2023: Spooder Burger
I’m trying to watch the movie by next weekend but the internet keeps SPOILING THE MOVIE IT SUCKS!
Me and my grandpa was planning to eat it so glad I didn’t eat it
I didn’t even know this burger was real
Twice it seems that the higher ups at BK either did not see that episode of SpongeBob (Patty Hype) or did not learn from it.
This might be my first Whopper to try, so WOOHOO!
Looks like a watermelon
Even the tomatoes are red
This burger gave me diarrhea....and then I died from getting hot by a car....coincidence?
Probably wouldn't get it anyway. Looks absolutely disgusting
I wanted this meal but they ran out of red buns and just got a boring burger. My disappointment was immeasurable, and my day was ruined.
If you’re saying is true that new red whopper burger dangerous to eat because I was going buy it in Friday but it was sold out…. I think I’m going change my mind of eating there
I've seen the film 2 times already.
1:16 - 1:25 This is fake, but still very funny 😂
The few times I went to Burger King have been either bad or meh, either because of food quality or stomach aches. Even tho the hospital thing is a joke, I’m not gonna take any more chances lol
I ate one and I’m still fine
Well that's a joke. I had that spiderverse burger 4 time in 2 weeks, nothing affect me. Just losing pound.
I thought it was going to be about the burger turning the droppings of people red.
Red 40 is just everywhere
I swear if you eat this burger, you're poop is going to be red I'm talking ya
Also, I’d do anything to not hear that Whopper theme again, *so I’m taking this burger soon.*
it looks like watermelon
They stole pretty patty. Nickleodeon should sue them.
I tryed it and boy was it tasty and I felt completely fine and I don’t even like Burger King
Women doesnot belong in the kitchen because if they belong in the kitchen then how else is gonna the rest of the house get cleaned
I liked this burger anyway, and I still need to try it 😂
I was not going to eat it cause its burger king but am watching spider verse cause its spider man
"Oh no, Uncle Ben! What happened?" "SPIDER-VERSE BURGER‼"
I ate it like 2 days ago and it’s literally just a whopper with Swiss cheese. And of course the infamous red bun
“What the buns” 💀 And what are they going to make next? A Fornite burger 💀
I saw it Thursday and now imma go watch it again lol
Oh yeah my family tried it and it was taste good BUT NOT EVEN GOOD💀
BREAKING NEWS:For the new “Terminator:REBOOTED” movie, Burger King made a metal flavored burger for FREE!
Well in that case, I guess I'm immune to the poison of the pretty patty after eating one. It truly wasn't much different from a regular one. Was kinda disappointed but at least I crossed it off my bucket list.
HOLY SH1T IT HAS RED TOMATOES????!?!? NOW I GOTTA EAT THIS
The title got me thinking it was linked to diseases💀
Rip that one guy from twitter lmao
I already ate 3…
Spider verse sucks it makes zero sense.
I WON'T EAT THAT GARBAGE, EVER, HOW MANY COLORS OF WHOPPERS DO WE NEED?😡😡
What a shame. I was gonna get one.
The ad came on before the video💀
"Women belong in the kitchen", what is this tweet? We're no longer living in the olden days of women stereotype. Men also too belong in the kitchen to help their girlfriends and wives to prepare meals, men isn't all the time reading newspapers and watching TVs like the old days anymore.
I already tried the burger, though.  I did a video about it a few weeks ago.  And I didn’t die.
It feels like the Whopper meme will last as long as Spider-Man himself!
The true anomaly is this burger. (Also pretty hilarious that Miguel had Spider-Man 2099 burgers in the spidey cafeteria)
Not going to lie I kinda want to try that burger
I just had one yesterday, it was good 😄
Yes! That last part is certainly the truth. Across the Spiderverse was an amazing movie and it deserves all the praise in the world. I just wanna say I love everyone who worked on that production. ❤🕷️
Too late. I’m never letting my brother pick where we eat again
Wait it’s very dangerous to eat new red whopper burger?
I ate it hoping i will become spidey. Now i see clouds, gates and some shit.
Eating this will turn you into this earths Spider-Man
As Someone who actually HAD the Spider-Verse Whopper, It was REALLY Good, And I didn't need to go to the hospital because of it. Granted I got it like... The DAY after I heard about it, But still.
I remember eating the black bun whopper cause of the people online and now wanna eat the red whopper cause of the people online. They sure pull off a reverse physiology on me without trying.
But I already watched it twice
I love how the BURGER ITSELF was referenced in the movie itself. Also you know darn well memes are gonna carry the Barbie movie
It’s not made with red dye, its actually made with beets
I’m not watching this movie😂 I didn’t even like the first one
bouta figure out if the memes are real I already ate one 3 minutes ago and I-
Burger King is gonna take over the world and kill us all! AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Spider verse whopper is like the Halloween whopper but the internet turn the dangerous from 0 to 100
I thought this video was a PSA at first, but thank goodness, lt’s only about the Spider-Verse Whopper being a meme.
The buns aren't made with red dye its made with beet juice.
If you get bitten by a radioactive spider you become spiderman  Eat the Spidey whopper ...  You become Uncle Ben or Uncle Aaron 💀
I hear the tomato is red too
Spiderverse burger = Red 40
For you morons! The Beet juice it's made with will CLEAN out your system!! BEETS ARE MEANT TO CLEAN YOUR COLONS!!
yeah I'm not eating that....
I got a BK ad before this video started
No fecking shite you don't eat it.  Not only does it look like a strawberry, but it'll probably turn your shite pink because of all the food coloring.
Vegetarians be seeing this as an absolute win
Oh I want to watch it again. It is tied for 4th favorite movie alongside Shazam Fury Of The Gods.
I did ended up with extreme diarrhea after eating that meal, unfortunately. So I'm the rare case of the meme being actually real.
I’m in the hospital right now because I ate the burger
I had it two times and I feel fine
Okay
They should release vegan variants 🌱 👀
I ate one when it first dropped and I’m not at the hospital lol   Does that make me immortal?
I Got an Ad For Burger King At the start
I ate the spider verse burger twice and I think I’m okay..
Its just a burger with red buns. Nothing wrong with it.
And what if you have already seen it twice?
How that Red 40 got me fucked up:
To late for me then
I will not purchase it as i do not go outside
Dont eat the multiverse burger got it 😉
It’s Burger King. It’s not exactly high-quality, but it’s not gonna kill you either.
Just another one of those phony fakes to get views, were getting tired of this
I just ate the Spider-Verse Whopper last week. It doesn't do anything to me.
Strawberry burger
This isn't the first time
1:24 I laughed soo hard🤣🤣
What the buns😭⁉️⁉️⁉️
Well I ate it and to be honest I tasted pretty good
I always thought the burger was dyed with red kool aid since it first appeared, imagine if it was
Good thing I ate the ice cream😂😂😂😂😂😂 or else I would be joining king kai
And I just had that whopper a few days ago too and I still survived
The Burger must be so good it's to Die for get it lol😂
W Burger King for saying women belong in the kitchen
barbecue bacon burger
Across the Spider-Burg
So your one of those people who judge food before tasting it. The burger actually taste different due to it's change of cheese. It's very good. I would recommend it.
Whoever else had the black whopper with A1 sauce from Halloween of 2015. Welcome to my club. 🎉
I got an ad for the burger as soon as I clicked on this video 😅
hi
It looks like they carved a watermelon into a hamburger bun. Tbh if that was the case, then that would probably get people sick because watermelon and hamburgers wouldn’t be a good combo.
Tried it without the bun got now cup no crown no red bun no ice cream yet paid full price it's bs
The boo burger
WHOS GONNA STOP ME 😈
It might be a poison Red burger 🍔☠️ so we need to canceled Red Burger
What the buns?!!?!?!!!!?!!??
Don’t eat it, or else the spot will manifest on your liver and tear you apart from the inside.
We’re first came out I eat it however a few days ago I have learned that if you eat now well you’re going to the hospital.  When I first eat it I’m a OK but remind me not to get it.
Across The Spider Verse and The Show Unicorn Warriors Eternal makes me Realize How much I Love animation as a Form Of Media
I got the ad for it
i love the red-40 burger!
The spiderburger
it made a whole entire Spider-Verse in my stomach
Just don't eat at Burger King
Don’t eat this burger🍔! But it’s weird that the buns and seeds look like watermelon🍉.
The green one for Halloween and now a red one definitely Burger King is trying to steal spongebob’s pretty patties
What?! Are u kidding me?!
The interent is back at it again...
I had no intention of trying it either, it's just like the Halloween Whopper
I've definitely already seen it it was good just mad at the fact that it ended with a cliff hang
This is the burger that killed Uncle Ben.
I still remember that one time they made a black burger for Halloween years ago with a weird goo.
I already ate it days ago😂
Too late 😂😂😂😂
Good thing i dint eat it
Sadly I work at my bk where it was being served people were crazy about it
halloween whopper 2.0 ☠️
WOPPER WOPPER-
man i'm new to this meme. and i downright hate it with the burning passion. thats terrible to me that i hate this :(
"what the buns" had me dying (of cring)💀
Don’t tell me it turns your poop green
💀💀💀💀💀💀💀 lol i dont like burgers but this.. i gotta eat i-  *Dies*
Spider Verse Burger are good, Vailskibum!
Why is bro acting like he never seen a different colored whopper and there was one before which is the Halloween whopper
1:31 W Burger King
Heisenberger in shambles 😔
I've already eaten one
So what you’re saying is, if I get in on this Meme, then my channel will blow up.
Bro even the movie had a better looking burger, and it was just that but with 2099’s face
when i saw 1 second of the video i thought i had an add lol
For a second I actually thought it was bad because of the title, but its just memes lol
What was it that Peter B. Parker said?  *“Don’t invest in a Spider themed restaurant”*
Even the tomatoes are red bro
You should only eat the D R E A M B U R G E R
Bingos
Nah bro they'll even let a burger be an spiderman
I ate it when it came out and nothing happened.Also that image of the burger king building themed to the movie is really cool.
I ate it  and I'm still alive!  So yep, tiktok lied to me again
They did a similar thing to The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie…the King Patty…It was a double whopper with a crown
im gonna get spider powers one way or another
You will get one spider verse inside of you.
Why would I eat a red burger?
You should change the video title because it sounds misleading. Change it to something like “Is the Spider-Verse Burger harmful?”
I’ve already ate it, and i’m died.
I ate it…
I ate it and im fine
If they put zesty cheese powder on the bun it would be unique.
1:34 based burger
Is this dark humor 😅
I tried that red whopper, and I'm alive
Didnt they do the same for the taco bell wings
After you die, the whopper send you to the spider verse instead of heaven
I had one on vacation and it was the best whopper I ever had
I just got a Burger King ad before this. It was in the spider verse one. It was a different one.
Chef: a professional cook, typically the chief cook in a restaurant or hotel.
Spider-Whopper.....in hindsight, that sounds horrifying.
I'm watching it today! So excited!! 😁😁
Y'all want fries with that?
Ive tried this Whopper 2 times
It looks tastier than the veggie burger
mfs think they spongebob fr
Spiderman
So is it really deadly? What'd they put in it?
The real reason why Peter Parker got his powers is because of the spider verse whopper
I tried it and never got sick from it.
ah spider-man flavored burger
Huh, who knew a BS Tiktok trend could be used for good.
People would buy anything that's sponsored by a movie. God, you folks are sick.
I bought it, taste like a regular burger but I got a cool hat so that was awesome.
borgir
I kinda knew this would happen. This is that Black Whooper of death all over again. But this time, it’s for the spider verse.
Y’all remember the Halloween WOPPER that was ORANGE
Reminds me of the broodwich
Help my poop is orange
I just want a Spider-Man cup
Too late💀
I got a Burger King ad 💀
Well, my brother ate it. Press F to pay respects to him.
Wtf what wrong with this petty good ass burgers Am so ¿confused? :/
BRO THE BURGER KING IN 2:07 IS THE ONE NEAR ME
I thought Burger King was full of chemicals, but after hearing about such a whopper, I will get the Spider Verse whopper until it’s ran out! Edit: Now I’m in hospital, THIS IS GREAT!
Icemammothhunterme:Disney is in big trouble with this burger of death!   Like 🍔+💦🖍️=💀💀💀💀☠️☠️☠️☠️
To match his suit should it be Black Buns Red seeds?
I understand Minions: The Rise of Gru but what did The Emoji Movie do?
The fact i got a burger king ad before this 😂😂😂😂😂
It just taste like a regular burger
2:13 I'm sorry, but did I hear that right? An Emoji movie Whopper????? 😂
I got the burger yesterday and I got scammed. I didn't get the bun
I didn't even know these food tie ins were still a thing.
I watched this movie 15 times.
I can't eat it regardless because due to my gluten allergy, I can't eat the bun.
I had the burger and I was fine
Chaos is lurking…
First the Halloween burger and now this? This is why branding foods like burgers try shakes
Pretty Patties IRÑ 😂😂😂😂
Shit looks like a ladybug
Glad I ain't eating it yet. I'll see the movie with Dave and Busters after that.
I started glitching and told myself don’t be rash
Honestly i think BK knew people would meme the burger which would result in more people trying it
With this burger I'm going Across The Spiderverse and straight to heaven
Lol i just got a red and blue slurpee to commemorate my awesome Dolby movie experience.
I ate the burger while watching this video. I got less than 30 seconds left on this planet. I just wanna say thank you for all you people have done, and lastlt, goodbhnb
Ive had a similar experience, a burger with black bun, black cheese and seaweed toppings, it came with a permanent N-word pass, i used to be white.
A mcdonalds spiderverse happy meal would be better than having a Multiverse of Madness in your stomach 💀
Thank god i didn’t eat the burger
Too late
It's just the broodwich's cousin
And is the Betond the Spiderverse coming out next year?
If it's made with red die 4 then I can see why there's backlash
Great promotion for the movie.
I can NOT believe that the Sequel ended with a Cliffhanger!
Many TikToks can be hoaxes.
It might just be in the colouring
I mean, Burger King's been pretty pattying for a long time now.
Issa BROODWICH 👿🥪
Oh no… I ATE IT JUST NOW.
It reminds of the whole Halloween Whopper situation back in 2015. Burger King had a history of colored buns.
What the buns???
It turns people s*it red like the black whopper
I got a whopper ad before watching this. 💀
It's as bad as the Halloween Whopper.
Oh god💀
WATERMELON BURGER
I love Spider-Man but that won’t make me eat the toxic waste that is BK
I’m gonna see the movie today, and I CAN’T WAIT!!!
Yeah I'd would rather eat a regular Whopper Burger then the Red Whopper Burger
me after eating the burger just before seeing this video: 🗿
Hey every today am gonna to take a bite of the new Spider-Man Arcoss the spider verse burger (Eats it) (DEAD)
what an insane good movie that has the worst burger i ever seen to imagine
Bruh I’m not gonna eat bread or wheat objects that are red that’s probably just a heart attack waiting to happen 😖 I still don’t trust it. Plus I don’t really like Whoppers and Burger King 😅  Leave the Red Food/Snacks for the Pros: the Flamin Hot snacks 👌
Already ate it for more than 12 hours still alive and well
1:40 Correction, they used beet juice to make the buns  Not red food dye
That burger looks fucking depressing,did they really think anybody would buy that bruh
Legend has it. The stomach ache from the burger was just ppl gaining spiderman powers.
I've ate it two times and I haven't found any problems with it
Well I ate that burger😐
Haha that's meme
IM STILL STANDIN
It turns your face red.
**Me watching this after eating the Spider-Verse Whopper**
It wasn’t from are timeline. It’s glitching that means we are in trouble
I got worried for a second cuz I’ve had the spider verse whopper so when I saw this video I was like “oh no I’m gonna die”
YouTube can read my mind at this point. I JUST bought the whopper from my local BK! Wish me luck!
Don't eat the Spider-Man burger. It's actually The Broodwich. If you eat the whole thing, you'll die. Though, I found a hack. They say you can't take it apart, but I did by taking off the tomatoes, saving me from death. You're welcome in advance.
We makin it out the spiderverse with this burger
Too late
I ate it.
Honestly if they were going to do a collaboration, they couldn't at least done with Nike Shoe brand you know like Mario's Boots lol.
Oh look an ambulance, NOW THEN  *Eats Spiderverse Burger*
I already are it like a week ago, its fine. Nothing too special, I also had the black burger they did many years ago. That wasnt special either. Its just fun.
I guess they should've listened to Peter B. Parker.  "Don't invest in a spidey-themed restaurant"
Lol the whopper commercial came on before the video
I watched it like an hour ago and i can't stop thinking about it. It was INSANELY GOOD.
Something bad could happend
This burger came from another universe where everyone is an underpaid cook
It’s all a conspiracy! In reality, People are saying not to eat the burger cause they know if you do, you’re gonna glitch out from multiverse shenanigans
2:12 ok what did he do about the worst movie in 2017
I also want to inform everyone that the Spider-Verse Whopper could give you food poisoning due to the high amount of red 40
Imagine going to the hospital, basically on the brink of death, and then after you’re resurrected by paramedics you have to explain that a burger    based on a Spider-Man cartoon did this to you.
So it’s a fine thing that’s jokingly a bad thing that’s doing a good thing for a phenomenal thing.  Well ain’t that something 🕷️
so the meme is real
It tastes like a million spiders are coming in my mouth
but i want it
Wait that thing was actually real?
I ate it twice and im still fine only thing its too messy but good just too much mayo
Funny thing is I was thinking of getting this Whopper before seeing the movie…but then I went to Chipotle instead 😅
Wooooooooooppppppppppeeeeeerrrr
How interesting. I might buy one in case I need it as a cyanide pill.
It looks like a watermelon
I actually went to Burger King yesterday to try it, before watching that gorgeous movie afterwards, and I really enjoyed it! I heard they dye the buns with beet juice. It shouldn't be causing anyone to go to the hospital.
im going to watch it when it gets released to disney +
WHAT THE BUN? **not gotta say bad which is h or f word ALMOST**
1:12 okay but why would you believe ANYTHING on TikTok?
I tried the Spider-Verse Whopper a month back when it was released, and it didn't make my stomach upset. Also, they used beetroot juice to make the buns red rather than food coloring.
I couldn’t anyway cause it’s not served in the uk
Ok, i will eat the SpiderMan burger
lol
I wanted to eat the Miles meal but I couldn’t see it on Uber Eats glad I didn’t risk my stomach lol 😂😂😂
I thought it was obvious not to eat the Spiderverse Whopper.
I knew it! It's made out of fucking spiders! I can't trust Burger King a damn bit.
I had one and it did noting to my body and it's really good I like the whooper has the white cheese
Didn't see video yet but I bet this involved colorful poo.
Early
Thank you internet
Is that the burger variant?
I’m going to go see it today
What the buns?
As I'm writing this comment, I'm at a drive thru at Burger King about to order the burger, but Valskibum told me not to eat the burger  I instead ordered the Bacon King :P
😂
I survived: The spider man whopper of 2023
I knew there was something horrible about this burger from the start.
What is going on with Burger King and memes around 2022-2023
Its true? Spider-verse burger kill? Aw Man, I always wanted eat It, but i afraid I won't eat It.
Wow, in my confession, I had this 2 times.
Is the Spider-Verse burger safe to try or not?????????????
I would rather see the movie than eating a red Whopper.
Fun Fact: Production on Across the Spiderverse was completed 13 days before the U.S. release date.
Too late
I ate it trust me I died
The sickness went Across the universe
i ated this bur and i died thankfully im back
I hope cinemas do something for the new transformers cuz its gonna be another huge summer release but it probably wont do as good as spiderman
But it looks so good…
Did you hear a lot of people have been having a hard time hearing the movie dialogue during some scenes with music ? Happened to me when I went to go see the movie, but I thought it was just cuz I have bad hearing.
Don't invest in a spider-themed restaurant.
I guess it’s a good thing Burger King uk doesn’t do promotions. Or any other promotion for that matter…
Vailskibum: DON'T EAT THE SPIDER VERSE BURGER me and a lot of YouTubers: too late *eats*
I tried it, its not bad, i also tried that one time black bun horse radish holloween burger if anybody cares
I been had it and it was so good 😮 (never had problems afterwards)
Wow! I never wanted to set foot anywhere near a Burger King, but now that I've heard these testimonials, I can't WAIT to get my hands on a Spider-Verse whopper!!
I got a spooder-man: across the spooder-verse ad before this video :)
Huh?!
In the first spiderverse movie Peter talked about how you shouldn’t invest in a spider themed restaurant. This might be the reason why
It makes me have a million spiders come into my mouth then I turned into a Spider-Man
Never eat the burger, watch the movie.
average burger in ohio
Burger King is benefiting a lot of this. Welp, its time to go try myself... hope l don't to the hospital.  (XD)
Its alright i wasn't gonna eat it anyway 😆🤣😂
bro its not even dye, its beet juice
I actually try a piece of the burger and i can safely say never believe anything you heard on the internet because it was not that bad to be honest.
I came here with 666 likes. 😰😰😰
I had it and I’m fine
Yeah, I wasn’t planning on it; looks terrible, plus I’m not a Burger King fan.
This whopper really is a anomaly in our spider verse.
Too lste
Too late.
Had it, nothing happened. Thanks Zoro
Shi look nasty
There is a certain kind of red food dye that can cause cancer, which is where I assume the hospital part came from, but I'm glad that's not the kind of dye used here. Just harmless meme-y fun.
I'm eating it rn 💀
Hmm what abou the Brazilian edition for the spiderverse combo? Even the french fries are colored randomly
I thought it was obvious since it's Burger King 😒
That is too funny!!!!
Spiderman spiderman His burgers might be from the white van
???
This is why I don't eat any of those.......... "special" burgers.
I went to my nearest Burger King and I was supposed to get this. But luckily, they instead gotten me the regular Whopper with the Spider-Verse sauce and never went to the hospital.   I even had the Spider-Verse Sundae, it was better.
never trust anything that says “what the buns”
the burger looks mid
it spawned a portal in someone's stomach then the portal sucked all of his organs out
To be honest, the Spiderman Whopper kinda looks like the Broodwich from Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Anyone else see that?
Uh oh 😰 that not good at all but yeah.
Did anyone think the bun was watermelon because I did
Why does the emoju movie have to do with this
add at 3am  in the title
Should’ve brought back the black burger that made your poop green.
Is it in the UK?
It feels like j jone James start this
So that’s why it’s not available in my country…
For a Second I thought this video was gonna start off with the Whooper theme Song..
Too late already did
It don't even taste good anyways
Cartoons food are real
deadly food episode 1
🫂
Spider-Man burger across the afterlife
I have an idea for a spin-off movie. After an evil glitch jester named “Slick” is released from his galactic prison,it’s up to Penni Parker,Spider ham,and spider noir to stop this evil jester before he destroys the entire multiverse,what do you think of this idea?
😮😮😮
The title sounds like a food theory video
i had it 5 times it was great
I can’t believe that Burger King made the tomatoes red, that’s pretty cool
I ATE IT 😭😭
In my country Spider Man Across the spider verse will release in June 22 and after watching this video you made me more hyped.
Sorry to be that guy, but it gets the red buns from beet juice.
Warning: Spiderverse whopper can cause you death
After that Addams family slush, we couldn’t trust ad foods
I'd eat that, I don't see the problem.
Hey guys, I’m about to eat the burger! Wish me luck!  First bite and I don’t feel much, it just tastes like a normal whoppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
I've eaten it twice I'm fine
Man Spider man can’t catch a break when it comes to food. First Tgi Spideys now this
Welp, all the more reason Burger King is falling
Well on the bright side,  it's the only ad to stop the whopper song.
lucky I didn't eat it
As someone who hates Burger King, I’m not surprised to hear this
Wow
I actually try the spider verse burger and I love it so much
No, don't worry, I wasn't planning to.
I hate Burger King anyway
Too late, I already did.
hey
Yea my local Burger King has been out of the red buns for weeks
I'll do it anyway because I don't care what happens to me
This is even WORSE than the Pretty Patty! 😂
Oh I'm not surprised, of course we're going to have repeat of the black wooper
I thought it was just a regular Whopper sandwich.
Too late (The Buns are Made with Beet Juice)
Not good
Opps I already reviewed it.
I honestly thought the burger bun was photoshopped ngl
I had it anyways. It's just a meme.
I knew something would be wrong with this whopper
I think anyone who watches this movie should be concerned. It is a "Part 1" apparently there isn't a resolution and they slap the "To be continued" at the end. I think everyone should be careful before watching it.
Oops. Too late.
I mean it looks rank
It makes you explode 🫨
I ate it..
I remember there being something like this with the halloween whopper with the black bun in 2016/2017
I wasn’t going to
next: do scp-3812 (chinese branch) vs shadow mind (shadow fight 3) song shoout x yes to heaven by benatora pls
Oh geez
I'm not planning to
I ate it yesterday :/
You are cool 😎
I ate the spider-verse Whopper yesterday and became Spiderman, cool powers but not worth my uncle dying.
Just Meme Around... To Make Spider Verse Even Bigger!
Seeing it today. CANNOT Wait!
Ngl it’s kinda cool seeing the Burger King guy talk about Spider-Man in one of their ads
AHAH! I KNEW IT!
Wait-- but I already ate one 💀
This commercial is straight up Cirnge
ITS TOO LATE SPIDER MAN! I HAVE EATEN THE BURGER oh wait it’s fi- EAHEHSH DRAWER VEE DR HI HAJJ  WE JFYSHF OK IFRYY TY DHGBD DE IW
This burger made my friend’s heart falter and she ended up in the hospital. Grateful she’s alive.
Shocker.
That burger will send you to the Spiderverse
Hey
Is it because it’s mid
When it first came out I was like should I try it to see if anything happened to me and when I try to get it it wasn’t available so am I lucky to not eat it?
Burger King in general, it’s not really what it used to be.😔
Early
Oof 😅
Let me guess, it turns your poop red
Yum, Into The Burgerverse!
thats messed up
I watched the movie yesterday! It’s so good… but I won’t spoil it! Also, this is a repeat of a similar burger that has done this before… uh… not really!
I’ll turn you a Black Teenager with so much exaggerated swagger
First
I'm honored to be here early
This video title was so off the wall, I didn’t realize it was you that posted this video for a moment.
First
I swear there’s always got to be a burger for everything lol
💀
first
It caused a multiverse of madness in my stomach :/
Uh Oh, Food May Be Dangerous!
Hi 30 second let’s go
Don't eat the burger, watch the movie 🍿 Edit: Anything SpiderVerse makes has to be good
sorry too late
whopper
Hey everyone..
