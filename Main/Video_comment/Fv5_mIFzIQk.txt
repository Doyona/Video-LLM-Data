ON THE ROAD AGAIN I love you and hope you’re having an amazing weekend
Brookes energy with Morgan’s is so good
i’m moving to indianapolis this august for college and i’m from California. me and my mom have a our trip planned through yosemite, Nevada, utah, Colorado,  and then like kansas or illinois and then indianapolis!
I am in Grand Junction, did security in Aspen for a few years, and family helped our founding Moab.
morgan is a theatre kid confirmed… i heard that legally blonde reference
I love this girl's personality she's so random.
Prime example of why I want to be besties with Morgan
That’s the Navajo Reservation.. lol chill hahaha 😂
FUCKING STOP SAYING GODDAMN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
I know this was a year ago BUT you should get Brooke AND Trinity in the SAME video!!! That would be super funny!!!!
The energyyyy😂😂😂
Y’all. I NEED the song name at 10:39
This video is my comfort video morgan what ever happened to her
Her laugh is everything
Idk I’m pseudovibing all good felt like u and brook on horses kinda movin traveling u know what
THIS VIDEO IS SO FUNNY
My life would literally be complete if I had a friend like Morgan like I would love to laugh endlessly
5:44 WTF!? 7:45 THOSE ARE CUTE! 14:09 WTF!?
Morgan & Brooke's laughter epic! 😅🤣😂 Thank you ladies!!
you are so effortlessly funny
We could literally SEE the ambition in Morgan’s eyes when Brooke mentioned iHop 😂😂✊🏼 Same girl, same
👍🏻💋🥰💓❤️🤣
Those earrings look EXACTLY like Barnosaurus Rex
I like Brooke better than Trinity.
I can't be the only one thinking of the Roanoak forest from AHS at 12:50 😭
I wish you were my best friend, ily
I feel emotionally exhausted and physically violated after watching this. Thank you
How could you not go too the Dino museum
the best western view part was so funny
Kids of the canyon here lol well somewhat but love the fact you went through the reservation, there are many schools and houses like that through out. Love this video 😄
15:36 i hear that Legally Blonde musical reference, ma'am
K but why did you get pulled over!?
💖
Morgan always on and adventure. 🤣😂😅
Being from the philippines, i enjoyed this too much
I love you Morgan 🤍 I need friends like you 🥺
morgan i have watched all your vidios like 20 times ilysm
MORGAN your whole ASS is OUTTTTT
what’s the song at 10:48 !!
Hung over still in bed on a Sunday afternoon just eating pb&j’s and along for the ride
I can never see a white van again and not think about Gabby Petito :(
The music over your grandma is so funny gets me every time
I stayed at the same best western in the SAME side of that hotel looking into the same parking lot whenever I moved across country at the beginning of the year and was equally as shocked by the view hahahahah
Anyone else watching and see the van similar to Gabby & Brian’s?????😅😳
I was hoping this was trinity but sadly it's not 🥲
I remember liking a comment years ago when Morgan realizes how dope she is she can take over the world well coming in to fruition thank you very much
But why were you pulled over?!!?
I love these two together
What shocks me is that people seem to have ditch masks EVERYWHERE (usa and canada) *except* where I live (Quebec). Why are we the only ones still with the muzzles?
"You won't catch me slippin' but you will catch me drippin'" Again, Morgan, 2021
"That is the selfie stick version of the traffic light" So many memorable quotes in this video!!!
"I said I was gonna *LOOK* at the Grand Canyon, not walk in it!"
No one: Morgan: *twerking with her a$$ out in the forest*
Lmaoooo Brooke filming Morgan  with her whole booty out tryna pop a squat lmao I love their friendships alll her friends are hilarious 😂😂😂 😂
The most relatable YouTuber , I feel like Morgan is taking us along in her trip , sending much love ! ❤️❤️❤️
“The Rock lives out here?!” “..UHNT UHN TAKE IT BACK!”
My wtf moment was at 12:45 , never knew morgan was so OUTgoing lol
They’re like Garrett and Andrew but girl version 😂😂
Let’s go to an IHOP ….. oh fuckkkk
the moving/road trip videos is the happiest i’ve ever seen morgan and it is so nice to see that she has people in her life like that🥺 i’m getting second hand happiness
Awwww I wish you would have came through my part of Utah🤪
You were in grand junction damn it that’s where I live Morgan what the F I could’ve met you ugh we could’ve got our nails done together
The girls: 4,000 altitude 🏔  Me in the Canadian prairies: 👀
"MORGAN AND I ARE ONLY BLONDE, BECAUSE WE EAT. EGGS." - A TRUE QUOTE FROM A WOMAN OF WISDOM (that made me CACKLE)
Us city sleekers are backkkkkkk
Omg I just love Morgan’s life now… she’s just being her and she looks organically happy ughhh
Mobile home 🤣babe its BOATTTT
Your personality is great, genuinely love watching you ! 💛
you are so pretty omg
"You meet someone in a soul cycle ONCE and now you're watching them pee in a forest"😂😂😂
You gotta be careful with them flys girl they lay eggs for maggots 🤮 you had one on that straw
♥️♥️♥️♥️
If I could subscribe again I would.
You guys look like twins
Love you babe
The amount of dislikes on this video is 420. That’s it. That’s the comment.
lol
Morgan I'm literally heading to Victorville, I'll make sure to visit the iconic gas station
I wanna be your best friend
WE GOT PULLED OVER FOR EATING TOO FRESH!!!!!!!!!!
The fact that you referenced dAnE SChnEiDeR and fEeT pics is everything 😂
I would watch the shit out of the Netflix show they should have
My mom always screams at me “YOURE BLESSED AND HIGHLY FAVORED” 🤣🤣
Are all US shopping carts that small? The UK ones are way bigger
Lol the outro got me in my feelings….I’ve been on an air bed for too long..
This was one of the funniest vlogs I've ever seen, and I was raised on Youtube,
I love this so much Morgan is my favorite
As a Denver girl I’m excited to know my Queen is now living back in CO again! Nothing makes me feel more at home here in a way ❤️‍🔥 knowing I could run into my love in a way!
Omggggg no the room infested with bugs noooo!
The energy of this entire video is me and my best friends at the point where we need to sleep so badly we're basically delirious and everything is just SO hilarious
This made me miss having friends a lot.
Omg also hate the cloud like tf is that
4:26 baddies to the LEFT   baddies to the R I G H T
ILYSM <3 MWA
“Baddies to the left” (pans to the right) “Baddies to the right” (pans to the left)
nice v..
"That is not real, i dont get where the kids come from" "...the canyon?"
The mobile home outside the Best Western VIEW was a house boat LOL
You were on the Navajo Nation when you saw the school. Some kids live 30+ miles from the schools and there are no paved rodes. All dirt.
omfg you guys are hilarious got me laughing my ass off at 2am
The guy getting you drunk enough for you to black out.... are you okay?
Morgan loved this trip more then she loved LA.
Man, I want to be their friend 😂 they are awesome
Miss girl Brooke is gonna catch these hands 😂😂😂 I say okiedokie all the time 😂 love her tho lol
I was just in Colorado and I held my breath through a tunnel like Morgan and I almost passed out 🥲 thanks Morgan lol
Can you yell me WHY there is a big ass airplane right next you on the the freeway!?
Wow, this is literally my reminder to stay away from rural Arizona.
Morgan giving her grandmother corn is the same energy as that vine when the kid gets an avocado for Christmas
Oh coooorrrnnn…. Thanks….
I’m living for Brooke! I done know why she wasn’t on sooner because they are like the dynamic duo I’m always dreaming for 😭
You passed through some parts of the Navajo nation. So yes there are kids that get on the bus to go to school in Page, AZ.
Edward Cullen. I died
سلام خوبی ahaeeuogd
Brooke is actually really annoying lol. She sounds like she’s trying way too hard to be funny on camera. Her laugh is super obnoxious and sounds forced.
I love your laughing omg you two had so much fun
4:17 I live for that laugh lol 😂
'We would end up on a Kendall Rae video' 🤣🤣
I WANNA ROAD TRIP WITH YOU SOO BAD
Brooke’s laugh has me dying lol 😂
why do Morgan and her friend literally look like sisters tho
This was so fun to watch, i love it
Having a water slide on the back of your mobile home is literally the definition of living life to the fullest lol.
Tell me you’re sleep deprived without telling me your sleep deprived
I hope she showered before going to sleep since she needed to go release out in the wild...
MORGAN WAS BORN IN UTAH?!??? I FEEL SO BLESSED TO LIVE HERE
You two need to have your own channel this is awesome much love from Scotland uk
I have lived in Santa Barbara and  Pacific beach CA. I Also lived in Denver, Breckenridge   and Silverthorne CO. I miss CO so much. I hated CA and was so lonely there. I made so many more friends in CO and felt so much more like myself there.
The fact that y’all came to Page, AZ and DIDNT HMU?!?!? Lol jk love y’all love from Page, Az we love you!!
Binging your videos makes me so happy ☺️
Goodnight kiss back 😘
The fact that I unironically as a 20yr old woman say okie dokie
I lost my shit at the traffic light 🤣
Just got done trippin. Morgan is a vibe
After nearly 50 years rocky mountain high has a new perspective in my immagination. Perhaps like Noah experienced in the mountains of ararat.
i miss you 😭
Thank you
What is the song name at 10:43??
this was the funniest video i’ve ever seen
THE LIGHT IM CRYING
THE QUEEN
LOSER
Iowans are offended by your corn chucking 🌽
Someone tell me this video has been posted before? Because I swear I’ve see it like 7 months ago..no way did just manifest? A whole video..Im so confused
The prices for rooms always go up thursday-sunday because most people come for the weekend so they upcharge to make more. It's cheaper to book a room on a  Monday
“The tree was a lot better than this”  Me: yeah it always is
I'm from Colorado this is such a good choice!

Only thing this vlog is missing is trinity
Her friends laugh is driving me insane
That bug on the straw was pole dancing
LMAO I STAYED AT THAT SAME EXACT HOTEL IN MOAB LIKE THREE WEEKS AGO AND THEY HAD THOSE SIGNS STILL HAHAHA. But the front desk guy was super sweet and helped me get into my hotel room twice after my keys kept deactivating at 11pm 😂
Okay but I need to know why u got pulled over for lol
"omi god omi god u guys" is morgan a... theater kid?
So At the end were you at your moms or in a set up bedroom of your house?
Keep the accent in every video💯
I hope she realizes how gorgeous she is inside and out. I'm glad she's moving away from plasticville. (just a joke, don't come for me lol) She's a beautiful Colorado girl. She's so pure, it's refreshing.
This is the best vlog I've ever watched 🤣🤣🤙🏼
Morgan ur one of my favorite people lol 😂
I loved seeing you in the town I live in! Grand Junction  did y'all right.
I laughed SOO HARD on both vlogs, I peed! I'm ready for more vlogs Morgan!!
Shout out to Kendall Rae !!! 🤣
*gets nails done* “Nature is healing” 💀🤣
Hahahaha cowboy Dave at the end
You’re definitely my favorite YouTuber 😂❤️
Hahahahaa the laugther. I love you Morgan, your content is so fresh and fun
why do I feel like Shane edited these
Often times, bars without women would like for women to come in and stay a while to attract men. (I watched an episode of Bar Rescue {sarcasm coming  danger. Watch out for the corniness }so now I know everything about the biz ;)
IM PISSED YOU WERE IN GRAND JUNCTION 😭😭😭 and i MISSED YOU 😭😭
I work at a hotel. The reason the price is high is because it's busy. Supply and demand.
This may be the best vlog I’ve ever watched
Morgan, you kept me laughing my ass off with the vent and the adventures for the days🤣🤣 love ya!😍
the woods is giving me twilight vibes
I love Kendall rae
PEEP THE CAR IN THE BACKGROUND PASSING AT 13:02 😂
Love u Morgan just hope you understand the privilege of the being pulled over scene 🥺
Morgan, what happened to your eye? you visit David?
Morgan… what did cowboy Dave do to your eye 👁
Cowboy Dave is EVERYTHING! 🥰
LOVE IT!
2:31 OMG OMG  UP IN THE SKY AS YOUR DRIVING THERE WAS SPACE SHIP LOOKING white round OBJECTS IN THE SKY THEY APPEARED THEN DISAPPEAR ONE BY ONE PLEASE TELL ME YOU SEE THIS???
Just two friends on a road 🥰🥰🥰🥰
not morgan singing legally blonde the musical
I want see video like this, just random clips combin together, is so wholesome🥺 choocked corn 🤣
We love you too Morgan!!! ❤️
Oh Brooks lovely 🤗
Lol the next time y’all drive thru Az, you’re welcome to crash here. I don’t have a waffle maker but I’ll make pancakes 🤣
THE KENDALL RAE REFERENCE
This is the best vlog you’ve ever made! I was laughing the entire time!
I LOVE KENDALL
The stop light was set up temporarily for construction.  It's scary you were driving and didn't know that.
The amount of giggles in this video makes my heart warm
Clearly LA did not hook it's claws into Morgan.... these Road Trip vids have been some of the funniest, most legit (appearing), happiest Morgan I think I have ever seen!!  Buh Bye L.A!!! Can't wait to watch Morgan during this new chapter!!!
I want to be on a roadtrip with you girls!!!
Y’all are fucking BEAUTIFUL THO 😭♥️
Morgan were you singing Legally Blonde the musical? 😂
baby gurrrrl that "mobile home" is 100% a houseboat lol
I get twilight vibes
I LOVE Brook oh my god
The world wasn't prepared for Brooke and Morgan but oh my God I didn't know I needed this in my life so bad
The fact morgan watches Kendall Rae confirms she’s the best
Colonizer!!! You should educate yourself before speaking next time. Smh.
Cowboy dave is the exact person YOU would hangout with on a roadtrip home 😂 i once met a crackhead Craig in nj he was a blassssst  Wonder how much money in gas this entire trip ended up coming out to. Cause good ol bidens bs with our gas prices is really helping people like me who have to drive 70 miles one way to get to town to work then 70 back. Fkn joke.    Love the content so happy to see you happy finally. Love it.
I. Just laughed all the way through loved it
Morgan what flew over your head @4:55 😨😵‍💫
I still keep replaying "cOWGIRL MAKEUP" in my head
Morgan and her friends are top quality people… so funny! 😆💕
This whole video is me when I'm sleep deprived lol. Ah I love when literally everything in the world is hilarious😄🤣
Omg I am so glad you madeee ittt :D  If you ever need a video edit or friend in Colorado I’m here !! My IG is aylabug398 :D
The Rock comment just fucking killed me…
You probably wont see this comment but I would give you my kidney or anything you asked for, for that green boulder crewneck lol 😂🤣
Brooke is so sexy ohheeemmmgeeeeeeee
Can’t tell you how much I loved your road trip adventure. You had me dying. I hope we get to see more of Brooke!! She is so hilarious & adorable!🤠🤠🤠
You guys are hilarious together and you can visibly see how happy this move is making you
*flashing cop lights* literally next cut: “so we spent the night in” … (dead ass thought she was gonna say jail)
How are you laying in your nice clean bed after being on the road all day
morgan!! i adore you but don't pee near water!!
Where's trinity ? Are you guys still friends ?
The stop light in the middle of the highway is for road construction. Instead of having a guy standing there with a stop sign, they just put a temporary stoplight there
*randomly throws a kiss good bye at the end*. Why'd I do that  *Morgan gives a kiss back* 🥺. I know why now
I’m in Salt Lake….and because of your drive… I shall be driving up the canyon tomorrow.
Loved this. I wish I could go on a trip out west especially to see Colorado again. I’m in Fl. I doubt I’ll ever be able to make it out that way. But I enjoyed watching this. Made me miss road trips.
Fav videos on all of youtube!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So happy for you Morgan!!!!!!!!
Girl, that scratch on your eye…
Shout out to GJ CO!!! Haha 😂 fun fact I’ve helped you check out at a store once in L.A. so weird that we are now both back in CO!
We need more Brooke content. I love her
Loving these road trip footage and Brooke being in the vlogs, she is a natural!!! ✨
The “tripod/selfie stick traffic light” is cracking me up bc I’m from WV & they’re randomly on backroads when roadwork is being done & my fiancé had also never seen one till he went to my hometown in WV w/ me lolol
Morgan taking a squat in the woods...now there's a sight I never thought we'd see.
This road trip was nothing but chaotic energy...... and I'm living for it 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Morgan, I envy your friendship with Brooke. Y'all had so much fun.
Best vlog ever!
I need more Morgan and Brooke content! 💕
I just moved from New York to California in a truck with three animals and it was a disaster. But this happening at the same time made me laugh 😭😂
YAY, glad you made it back safe. I enjoyed seeing your trip and can't wait t see hat you do with your new house and further adventures!!!
What happened to the side of her face by right where she's bleeding did I miss that somewhere
"Megan likes to show her naughty parts to her girl with the thick eye brows, 'you will catch me drippin' And I will eat your Yolk."
"Megan, you eye looks all smashed and scratched and bleeding."
Calls the house boat a motor home with a slide 😂😂 I can’t 😂
I watch you and I watch Kendall too. 😄👍
brooke is hilarious
I wish I was adventurous like Morgan
seeing you happy with a pal makes me feel like I am alsoooo happy with a pal
Pee isn’t littering it’s watering
I just wanna say *Thank you Morgan for posting*   I’m going through a very heartbreaking break up  right now and I’ve been crying for the past 2 days but seeing you posted and watching your videos has honestly been the only thing that’s made me laugh or smile
The Canyon kids jokes was everything 😂😂
Lmao the whole time I watched this I was thinking — I’ve driven from LA to Fargo, ND in 4 full days (1600 miles). How is it taking them like 6?? Love you Morgan but you def should have taken poor Brooke to the dinosaur museum.
Can we just acknowledge how happy Morgan looks. 🥰
I LAUGHED SO HARD  CAN YOU DO  A DAY IN YOUR LIFE WHILE FIXING UP MOVING TO YOUR PLACE  SORRY FOR THE CAPS  MY CAP LOCK IS STUCK
Ok I need the holy trinity of Morgan, Brooke, and Trinity.. I cannot imagine the chaos and dysfunction..😭😭
Your laughs are infectious 😂 makes me miss having more female friends!
PLZ BROOKE'S LAUGH HAS ME DYINGGGG
I loveee you!!!!!!! 😂💜
Okay ladies... here's how you pee on a road trip. You pull over along the side of the road and open the passenger side front and back door.... then you squat, wipe, and pull pants back up. People may have an idea of what you're doing, but they can't actually see you in your little three sided hut of shame.
I saw no disaster....I enjoyed all your trip home!!!!
Imagine a world so small that you just found out your real grandfather is a man who rans Simpson's market in az that your grandma had an affair with and you just saw it on a YouTube video lol
“That mobile home has a water slide on the back of it” Miss ma’am, that’s a houseboat.......  I used to live in page and you guys NAILED it with your assessment of what a trash place it is.
I just wanted to say that the Nickelodeon part could not be so far off, maybe best western bought decommissioned stuff from the holiday inn Nickelodeon resort, bc it looks awfully similar (or they bought from the same supplier)
I love your videos they always make me smile :) Ty Morgan for always putting me in a better mood everytime you upload a new video
When you go school in the canyon . I'm kids of the canyon 😂
Hope you have a good first aid kit in your car, Morgan... always include antiseptic or polysporin cream - you could have put it on your scratch on your face. Hope it's healed well.
I really hope I will be able to find a friend just like Morgan! She is so funny and sweet, not fake at all. I can't wait to see what other adventures you get yourself into :)
that was stupid to leave the keys in the car. some one could drive by see that and take off with your car.  you got lucky they didn't but they could have
Morgan and her only friend makes me wish I had 1 friend to travel with too. lol
You just called a house boat a motor home lmao
HAVE BROOKE MEET ANDREW
I wish I knew you were in Grand Junction!!!!! I live right around the corner from that nail Solon!😭😭😭😭😭
Look like something to eat u do shytt
Not a huge fan of road trips but would be SO DOWN to go on one like this! Laughed right along with you two throughout the whole video! You look so genuinely happy about this move. So happy and excited for you!
Best Best Western story. I booked a handicap room. It was upstairs. No elevator. No kidding. I asked where the wheelchair trebuchet was located as they must launch wheelchairs from the parking lot and I was told it was my fault for not asking if handicapped, wheelchair accessible rooms were located on the ground floor. 😳
“We got pulled over for eating too fresh” I can’t with y’all😂
Am I the only one wondering where Cookie is? 🍪
Morgan never disappointed us with her content
Use hopper
Okay but why did Morgan get pulled over actually??
Brooke and Morgan give off similar energy to Brittany Broski and Sarah Schauer and I fucking love it
That's what i love 'roadtrips with Morgan and friends'
John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen.
These two road trip vlogs were the most lively and real we've seen you! And I LOVED IT
Not me crying laughing at you and Brooke at 5am 😂😂😂😂
Ive been to Denver so many times its a vibe.
Now, I have something new to think about when I pass or stop at that dinky traffic light on my way to visit relatives lol It's cool to see you guys were near and driving through the Navajo Reservation! & Congrats to the next chapter in your life! I'm excited for ya!
*Brooke - Morgan - Trinity* make it happen bih!
Morgan acts like she's never been taught a single thing about the dangers of taking free drinks from male strangers. Same thing with Dave too.
Me: someone who says okie dokie all the time 🥺
I love you!!! I just wish that you would post more often. but i will always watch you youtube every time you do post
*Hey, to you reading* ..... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
I can’t believe she went to the Navajo nation
The crew neck looks so cozy! Where is it from???
We have plenty of random stop lights in the middle of nowhere because they're either doing or need to do roadworks..
Well now that you’re in Colorado , you can go on the sesh podcast with Kendall Rae !
my cousin goes to that school 🧍🏽‍♀️
this is awesome i’m so happy for you!! colorado is awesome!!
Morgan I live in Aspen  you could have asked to stay here…
But I live in Colorado let’s hang out :)
“We got pulled over for eating too fresh” 💀💀😂😂 howling rn, everything about this is hilarious.
I was laughing with them as if I was in the car with them. So wholesome, I love this 😂
herpes
I feel personally attacked… I say okidooke 🤠
Girl I love you too! I wish we could be friends we would get along so well?!!
Please please please do a meet up or something in Colorado! We are from the same home city and I want to meet you so bad!
This video is so wholesome it gave me the warm fuzzies :)
This has been the best video like because its made me laugh so much I phuck ing laughed into my bowl and blew the herb out hahahahah
Skinny legend you look amazing your skin is so clear
U guys are brilliant. You both had me laughing throughout the whole video.  I also just moved out of California to Colorado.  I’m starting to realize that Colorado has become just as expensive as California.
Hi! Awesome video! Love the beginning part of it! Where are you and your friend going?
sis u are GLOWINGGG😍
Basement hotel seems like a fire hazard...
Omg #24 on trending
The fact that they were concerned about the horses not holding their breath sent me

So funny! Love the vlog!
MORGAN SINGING THE LEGALLY BLONDE MUSICAL SENT ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YESS!!! ♥
Brookes laugh is so cute I love it 😂
“We got pulled over for eating too fresh”💀😂
Please NEVER stop posting rap music behind your grandma 🤣 oh my gosh I laugh so hard everytime
the “mobile home” is a house boat 😂😭
Emoji without context: 🛑
where tf is trinity???
I live in grand junction!! Girl you shoulda hit me up!! I could have did your nails!! Haha ale house is the best btw!
Morgan I think you found your soulmate 😂 . The duo we didn’t know we needed
Bed bugs noooooo mam turkey or ham
dude this girl brooke has brittany broski energy lmao
Brooke reminds me of Hannah Montana when using that southern accent!! 😂😂
You and brooke are hilarious and should have your own channel
I swear to God! Brooke's laughter is exactly like mine it freaked me out! AHHAHAHA
morgan needs a show on the travel channel
I love your friend!! She looks like she could be your sister! Love her whole energy… amazing video as always!
morgan trending 😍 we love to see it
The kiss at the end was for Cowboy Dave
9 days until Eid Ghadir9 روز تا عید غدیر خم
Morgan I have been so depressed lately. Worrying about my wedding being canceled because of covid and my job. But this series is everything! And has cheered me up immensely! Thank you! ❤️
The hotel waffles are so good tho😫
YES WE LOVE MISS BROOKE BUT BAES I WONDER WHERE TRINITY IS!?
Heyyyy when she said happy pride I died lol 😂
💗💗💗
OMG, Your mom is the best......."i thought you were getting me coldstone" lmao
love the energy
Page Arizona is absolutely wild. Like I went there and there was so much nothing and stuff in general. There’s like four houses and seventy five bus stations
I’m actually so confused are her and trinity not friends no more? ://
Is blacking out cause of high altitude a real thing? Cause that makes SOOO much sense when I went to colorado and blacked out and puked in my friends car…. So maybe this explains EVERYTHING
Missed out on so much in moab. It's my home away from home.. I wear sandals hiking too it's fine 😆
the editing to the effects of the laugh. the peek of comedy.
I hope Cowboy Dave’s career kicks off because of you
♥️♥️♥️
By far the funniest vlog ever!! Morgan needs Brooke in every video!!😋
Ew
Kendall Rae just chillin on the TV like: 🧍‍♀️
This video has me laughing so hard 😂 I love the friendship chemistry you guys have! Love you Morgan and thanks for your videos 💗
stoners!  lol yeee haa!
Where is Brooke from does she have to get all the way back or does she live close to your mums, also what a good friend and good memories you made ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Moving to denver in September im so nervous but so excited!
Are you supposed to be somebody?
UM, that’s a mannequin in the cop car at Twin Lakes? I live in FoCo, and just recently spent a weekend in Twin Lakes and kept slowing down by the cop car. 🤦🏼‍♀️ P. S. I used to be terrified of mountain driving, I’m originally from NYC but after watching your road trip videos I finally got the courage to do it! I even drove Trail Ridge Road solo this weekend. So, thank you!
So nice seeing you laughing and having a good time 🥰 after the last couple of years you have had, you deserve it xxxxxx
Brookes laugh is awesome, totally the kind you have to laugh along with even if you don’t know why you’re laughing!   😂
you two are hilarious lmao!!
the first time ever looking at the "trending" area of youtube and I see this and ssundee. now i remember why i never look at trending
We need more Brooke! I love this
Pleeeeease collab with The Sesh.
It’s not “getting yolked”, it’s “getting yoked”. A yoke is what they put on Oxen to pull things… so they are getting big like an ox 😆😆😆
Having a time with your bestie 👏🏻👏🏻 i miss those days 😌  Another 🤞🏻 good luck driving tradition is to ALWAYS lift both feet when you drive over railroad 🛤 tracks ..  so much fun 💞👯‍♀️
Make me so sad seeing where I used to live... i miss grand junction, its a wonderful place ❤
Me and my gf just went to a Best Western plus by Austin tx and had Texas shaped waffles with the BW initials on them 😎☀️
I am sure I am your #1 fan!  I am as old as your grand =mother and I just adore watching you.  You make me smile so much!!!  You are the 2021 version of I love Lucy.
I say oki doki! I sometimes even at smokie! 😢😳
Why’d u get piled over? Speeding?
💖💖💖💖💖💖
One is stuck playing the impassioned protagonist in one’s Subjective Narrative of Self 🔻
Gonna have to live without mommy and daddy at some point
morgan brooke and trinity need a ROADTRIP!!!!!!!!!!!! sooooo funny!!!!!!!!!!!!!
As someone whos worked at a shit ass Best Western, im glad to know they are all janky as hell across the country. Also checkout is at 11 and breakfast ends at 10 usually
You two are so much fun together
Hotels are such asses for that.
Love your vlogs! Greeeeetings from the Netherlands!
wow, GJ actually came through for someone, you must be lucky. lol
I been to Estes Colorado and the whole way there was beautiful! Your making me want to go back😍 also the easiest way to pee on a tree is squat and lean on it. 🤣
Protect grandma at all costs
I'm pretty sure that if Cowboy Dave had a YouTube, he would highly appreciate you putting him in your outro.
You bring me so much joy. I use your vlogs to unwind from my unpaid practicum hours.  😬
After every 10 second  HAHAHAHAHAHAHA......
“We would end up in a Kendall Rae video” 😂 I love you both
"watch for rocks"
This is the best road trip ever!!
‘I don’t get where the kids come from.......’ ‘....the canyon’ 🤷🏼‍♀️🤣
Laughed so much at both of your antics on the road trip!   Loving your vlogs so much Morgan you are awesome xxx
Safe travels sistah! XOXOXO
Omg i haven’t laughed so much in a very long time. I love you two together 😂💞❤️
Sorry I haven’t kept up in a while what happened to trinity?
The way I was so excited to watch this!!!!!😭😭😭😭
Video is great
Brooke's "Cowboy dave how do you call people" he says " i am on the run" and "bartender scott why do you keep giving us these shots" he says "you're in the hot corner" have the same energy lol
Morgan you are the funniest person on the internet
The Kendall Rae comment 😂😂
this is hilarious lmaooo
Nothing like being home sweet home!
Why is this white women on the trending page, cause of white privilege 😐. You should give your channel to a ⚫ person.
I thought there was a ghost behind her, but it was just her super white ass. Lol same girl, same..
got pulled over for eating too fresh
Loved the video. Made me laugh and smile so much.  I don't want you to go. You guys are so cute and have so much fun together.  💗
Where tf do I find spontaneous/hilarious friends like this? So fun 🤩 I love this series.
Pro tip, the best westerns in Texas have Texas shaped waffle makers! Plan your next vacation accordingly
Lol Morgan turned off the car so they wouldn’t take it but still left the keys in the car 😂
Have fun and stay safe love you and thank you for the video.❤️
I had the absolute PLEASURE to experience part 1 and 2 back to back on my lunch break in my car and this is the longest I've smiled continuously. On a RAINY MONDAY. Blessed.
Shout out to everyone that did the canyon in flip flops!
https://youtu.be/KU9Dag1mrDU
The laugh while the rainbow was there killed me 🤣
Omg. The stop light is because there's construction 🚧 and traffic has to travel on one lane
Dude hell no, fuck bed bugs
Morgan is so relatable i love that she isn't like other youtuber girls  who try to act perfect all the time morgan is as real as it gets everyone needs a morgan adams as a friend
They got hiring signs up but don’t want to hire we need MONEY..!! 😳😳in my 👁TRUMP IS THE BEST HE IS A BEAST.!! I VOTED TRUMP 💯
I love discovering a new channel! Subscribed ✅
Lmaoooo HWY 89😂😂😂
im convinced Morgan only hangs out with comedians, I swear I've never laughed so much
SoulCycle-Friend-Brooke is a Class A delight
hey i say okay dokay all the time
Watch "😂😂When you woke up late for school" on YouTube https://youtu.be/YRC7onZPWS4
House tour! House tour!
6:03 what the hell are you doing in my home - william reinhart
🌺💕
No i hear you 3:51 i dont wanna frick with roman reigns fans aka the kids well they were now the whole world can acknowledge roman
Thanks again shoutout trinity
Lmao the single light was cause it’s a one lane highway 😂 You stopped to let people go hahaha
Wait, the fact that you got pulled over in Utah is making me die inside! That's the only state I've ever been pulled over in and it was the worst experience ever. The lady at the hotel we were staying at was talking so much shit about the way they find any reason to pull people over. Idk what the real reason was for you, but eating too fresh wouldn't surprise me. lmao
Hahaha I say “okie dokie” might as well start sayin I’m “yolked”
MORGAN!! SINGING LEGALLY BLONDE THE MUSICAL OH MY GOD OH MY DOG YOU GUYS. Pls be my bestie 🥺
I love Kendall Rae!
I was just in Moab, Utah and Colorado!! 🥺🖤 Full circle moment.
You've obviously never lived in the country. We had those stop lights for construction zones all the time. Lol
how messy, loved this!!!
I love that you watch Kendall Rae. Makes me love you that much more 😍
Yours and brookes friendship 😭
Stay safe when accepting drinks from men, ladies. Even if he’s pouring it in front of you.
Is she still friends with Trinity? I miss her
18:30 she said blair witch
Here is a tip you can just stay and they will i to charge you the $100 fee for leaving late
The delusional and chaotic laughter is my favorite thing about this vlog
The stop light is a makeshift one for the construction 🤦🏻‍♀️😂
"we got pulled over for eating too fresh"
My goodness, what a stunning landscape!  Are you in awe of it or is that just a normal sight???
Oh Morgan you & your friend should have your own bloody travel show!!! I want you to do a road trip every week!! Xoxo
Lmao to funny
as a canyon kid I find this highly offensive im joking love u
Where the fuck did brook go did she just go home after that
This was a HOOT 💖
We adore you.  Night,  night!
Hi morgan how are you
😂🤣😂🤣😂❤
My husband and I just had our honeymoon in Estes Park and Denver a month ago. Colorado hits different. We can't wait to go back sometime, it's absolutely beautiful there.
YOLK
i haven't laughed this hard at a video in a long time. loved this so much.
Idk what I would do without these videos rn! They cheer me up so much! ❤
That the rock joke was an actual knee slapper tho
Where’s trinity
4:15 that laugh though !
I loved this road trip, I always wanted to go to a road trip like that but then I remember I don't have friends or a car. lol
We need more Morgan & Brooke duos!!
Awwww friendships ❤️ from 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
I didn't want the road trip to end hahaha
Just finished watching all the vlogs. Can't wait for more, especially with your new house. xoxo
Missing trinity
that was a wild trip
Morgan looking like a skinny legend, ur already goals before 💕
i have a small roadtrip coming up with a few of my girlfriends and this has gotten me PUMPED for it
I loved everything about this but hearing the Legally Blonde reference really made me love it more 😂💕
brooks laugh is so fucking cute oh my god
okie dokie? more like ~okie yolkie~
😄
What ever happened to trinity !? Brooke reminds me so much of her! I wish I could go on road trips 😭
lmao its called the indian reservations lolol
did i love your grandma
LOVE UR. CONTENT
your moving flogs make me want to pack up my stuff and move at least halfway across the country without telling anyone
I took a roadtrip for my birthday 2021 from Houston to Denver then Aspen it was so amazing and beautiful 😍
Morgan....your videos are not boring....you are such an awesome youtuber....dont stop k
I miss Trinity 😞
I love your road trip videos ❤️
Omg.. I wanna see Morgan, Trin and Brooke in a video together! I know Trin is very busy these days! But still.. that'd be a fun video! Hahah.. especially a road trip or camping one hahah ❤
Looked like the motel from The Shining. Especially the shot of the long hall.
I would of wanted to go to the dino museum toooo😂
#morgans vlogs gurlllllllllllll ILY unconditional but ur friend just cackling WAY too much was like um WTF IS STONED?! YIKES! :p  PS~Cant wait to see ur house plz dont make us wait till u fix it up we want to see it now/before too! Muah xo
WHAT IS YOUR FRIENDS SOCIAL MEDIAAA
Brooke’s laugh is almost better than Andrew’s! Almost!
I'm not sure if this video is SO SUPER funny..  OR  If its cuz I ate an edible... and I just THINK it's this funny.  😝
Friend seems a lil passive aggressive
You crack me up ... what a freaking hoot of a trip!
Any time Morgan goes on a road trip, camping, any kind of travel it's always hilarious and the best videos hahaha
Aw this is really cute!
Hey gurl I go Boon-docking every weekend and when it comes to small bladders, you gotta do what you gotta do 🤷‍♀️
We have to see a Kendall and Morgan collaboration💖
Dude this was soo freaking funny. I want to go on a road trip with you guys please hahah
I just love watching your videos, full of radomness and fun! keep it up GURL!
Morgan...did I just see your ass?
I wore flip flops at the grand canyon and I almost fell off the cliff side 😅
Kids of the canyon needs to be a real freaking movie—-I would pay so much money to watch that no cap. 😂😂😂😂
How did you guys miss the perfect opportunity to say "yolkie dokie" lmao
Girl I hope you guys threw all your clothes in the dryer IMMEDIATELY and left your luggage outside. Bed bugs are no joke! Had someone house sit for me while my husband was deployed and I was out of state. Came back and turns out they brought bed bugs into my house, it took over six months to get rid of them. Had to burn my headboard, curtains and mattress. Bomb the house and treat inside all the baseboards and carpet. I'm still living with the PTSD from it..
I live in grand junction! LV spa and nails is a great place.  I'm sad I didn't get to run into you
I want your sweetshirt that says "Aspen" thats my daughters name !
Lol
Colorado is a beautiful state! 😍 I would love to visit again in the future and also Logan, Utah since I lived there for a little while. 😊
💛💛💛💛💛💛
If this is not life, then what is...
I live in junction bro that’s so cool that you went through here and got your nails done
4:15 this editing had me screaming lmaoo
Brooke's laugh just feels like a female version of Andrew's lol
I keep wanting to go to CO and the more I’m seeing how beautiful it is the more I wanna go 😭 I live in Oregon it seems like it wouldn’t be too terrible to adjust cost wise and weather
What ever happened to morgans bff Trinity??
Ok so this was epic! What a super fun road trip. And so much better with a great companion who hypes up the absurd. So many laughs! I shared tears and smiles with u both. Enjoy being home😻💗🍸🎉🌟🇦🇺
Y'all had so much fun
great Vlog!
Don't leave a wad of toilet paper in my mountains. If you can't pack it out, then bury it.
Where’s Trinity??
The tri-pod red light talk ended me LOL
Yay grandma !!!!
I was looking at the footage of Morgan going downtown and thinking it looked familiar and then realizing it was my route home and to my local grocery store 😂
i love all the laughter in this video its so wholesome
Yass house tour!
Morgannnn. You are so brave and adventurous. You did that shit. It's inspiring. You're inspiring!
Love your videos I definitely needed this video I laughed so hard the last few weeks have been tough my boyfriend and my sons father passed away 3 weeks ago so been tough definitely needed this and get my mind off of things ❤️
0:45 Why do you have THREE garage door openers???!
You missed horseshoe canyon!
MORGAN START A PODCAST MAYBE ????? With your entire family!!! You could have a different family member every week or maybe as many as you can get. Friends, family, neighbors, ex bfs, we want it ALLLLL. No drama, just hilarious anecdotes and silly conversations, I know it’s similar to Ethans Families podcast but maybe you could say it was inspired by him and just embrace it. And make it your own. I would watch the fuck outta that
Oh goodness, Brooke is hilariously adorable and the two of you together is the kind of content I am here for ❤️

Not me remembering Shane’s videos on hotel rooms hidden cameras hen thinking of how many hotels they’ve been in
They are literally twins
4:15 the audacity
When they realize there is an entire town of people in the canyon.... it's a real thing. haha
Honestly these two roadtrip videos is probably the best you’ve done yet. It’s so real and funny seeing you be completely yourself, and you seem super happy, it’s definitely rubbing off on these videos. My favorite on your channel so far was this
Is it me or does her friend try to laugh like Trinity?
You're a Kendall Rae stan too omg
Okay Brooke, I love her! Bring her on more! She reminds me so much of your other friend. You three together would be a fucking sitcom and I would watch!
the light is for construction 😭😭
Where did you get your aspen sweater!!! It's sooo cute 😍
SO LOUD and obnoxious.
The friendship you share with Brooke is amazing. I wish I had a friend like that to do stuff with. I laughed with the two of you the whole time. That trip looked like so much fun! Can’t wait for the house tour.
I love you Morgan baby ❤️
thank you for the goodnight kiss <3
More road trips plsssss
I live in Ky, plzzzzzz message me on IG. Yaaagirlkuhn.... I don’t have many followers but you are so me we would make great friends lmao. I have nobody to talk to it’s sad. Love you regardless xoxo lmao
My okie dokie shame😔
You should play that Willie Nelson song 🎶 “on the road again”
they have the same exact laugh
That mobile home with a slide is a boat 😂
brooke reminds me of trinity 🥺both iconic queens 👸
Girl , ( cowgirls, that was so much fun, love going on journeys, of the unknown , with your besties . You M, know how "to do life ", & share with the class. Thanks for the ride & for introducing awesome Brooke... 💕😍🚘🏬🗻🌄👏🙆👭
OMG, the giggle-fest!
That stop light is used during road work. Super common for road work in rural areas. It’s because they only have one drivable lane and both directions of traffic have to use it. It’s like having a flagger on but 24 hrs a day.
Looks like you two had a good time!  Hope the scratch by yo ureye is better.
The more you know 🌈💫 Colorado drunk = blackout 😵‍💫
Your videos have been such a vibe lately. ❤️
I love Brooke!!! Love the bond you all have!
Awh I love that she mentioned Kendall I love her
you know flys throw up everytime they land
Brooke absolutely cAcKLInG at the “best western view” view is ME. So relatable 😂
Love you Morgan!  From a mom of 3 grown boys who wished for girls!
The rock lives here  has killed me 😂😂😂
the way there actually is a school in the grand canyon
Ha
She laughs like trinity
this is so much fun to watch!! you guys had great energy throughout the whole trip!! love u guys!!
i can’t wait to see her and trinity back together
that ending was everything and made me actually go "aww bless her heart" out loud. that was too precious.
So crazy to see videos of a city you live and grew up in.  Even crazier to see someone pan past your apartment building.  Gotta love Union Station 😅
studied and made this my motivation so i can just be done and watch this! I love you morgan! make my life complete and give me a like 😭🥰
All I wanna know is if she actually got a ticket 🤣
OMG I LOVE KENDALL RAE I DIDNT KNOW U WATCHED HER TOO
i love you! your videos are the only thing that get me through my days
BUT WHY WERE YOU PULLED OVER
If you aren't doing a road trip like this, then you are doing it all wrong! Yall had too much fun omg. :D
Where is Trinity though?
the moment of giving grandma the corn was actually sooo cute and funny <3
Hold tf up did Morgan say she stayed in a room infested w bugs ?
I can confirm that peeing is not littering
Haha you took me back when I did my road trip 🤣
I like this friend 😊
You and your friends are so funny😂😂
Ummm, where's Trinity???
Emma chamberlain didn't give us a goodbye kiss in her latest vid so Morgan did tyy
i don't know why but i lost my ever-loving shit at Brooke air-quoting Morgan saying they didn't have time for the dinosaur museum and being so proud of her dino earrings  😂😂😂
pretty sure that, "Mobile Home" is actually a party boat lmao
Love the Legally Blonde song! LOL! :) Keep up the great videos!
when I tell you I SCREAMED when you went to grand junction bc that's where I live and no one comes here. I said "that's my nail salon💅"
Yolk is actually pronounced yoak. FYI!
I so need a road trip with these girls. Haha
Im just going to say it...this "friend" is acting a while lot like your actual friend from home. It's so fake
Nearly pee-laughed numerous times. I appreciated every ounce of this.
Best journey. Loved it. Made my shitty day. Thank you.
I'm genuinely sad that there is no part 3 to this road trip!
Morgan I see you in the comments 👀 say hi 💖
What is Brook on? She is always hyped up!
Did you see at 2:31 when you talk about the school sign múltiples flicking light ? Did you spot UFOS ,Morgan?NEVER MIND is the réflex of the Morgan’s inside car
We’ll end up on a Kendall Rae video lmao
I haven't been this excited for a video from her in a long time, I'm ready for the new era of Morgan
where was the cat the entire time
Do a video with Kendall! Maybe about your ghost? 😩 pleaseee
Cowboy Dave may never be seen again, but he will live in our hearts forever. Remember, we're all his wives now.
I love the laugh.
I don't love everyones vlogs but I do love yours :)
it’s not bye , it’s see ya laterrrrrr
Morgan and her friends would literally laugh of and at everything 😂🤣
Wait, did you actually stay in a bed bug infested hotel room? Please say you didn't 🙀
That was fun😂😂
How kewl , I live in grand junction !
This was some wholesome content I love this side to you Morgan. This was a fun trip! For someone who’s stuck in lockdown again in Australia this was fun 💜 also we love your friend Brooke hold that friendship close 😍
WHAT ARE THE THINGS IN THE SKY AFTER THE SCHOOL??
I love Kendall Rea my two favorite Youtubers!!!!!
The stoplight 💀”what are stopping for??”
Those VIEWS. I’ve never seen anything like that 😍😍😍😍
Yasss you in Utah🤌🏻
Wow I didn't know you were born in SLC. Me too. :) Still here though :( lol
Morgan and friend don’t understand construction and think a houseboat is a mobile home with a water slide 😂 and I’m only a couple minutes in
I'm old, but I say, "Okie dokie, artichokie"
Omg I love the constant laughter between you guys ... What a fun friendship ...
ayyyy house tour excited for that
The fact that you watch Kendall Rae ❤️❤️❤️
Just so happy that Brooke is now comfortable to talk in front of the camera…
Well that was fun!!!
Did I hear legally blonde the musical in there?
💞😇👍
Who else was smiling and giggling throughout the entire video?
THE VIDEOS ARE BETTER WITH BROOKE ITS MORE FUNNY
morgan’s content is so wholesome and amazing. whenever she posts it automatically makes my day <3
This is exactly how I knew this trip would go glad we didn’t have a Reese’s pieces incident in MOAB again
i need a friendship like Morgan and Brooke pls friendship gods
i wish i had a friend like morgan. and brooke. and trinity. so instead ill just live vicariously through your youtube videos cause im a lonely ass bitch T_T
That is my dream road trip no real pre planning just going and doing and having fun and not having to go home any certain time! Ugggghhhh I’m so jealous!
The best series on youtube
Hills have eyes
Morgan, why the duck is there scratches on yo face ??
This actually made me sad because I don't have any friends that would go on a road trip with me
You two were legit sleep/car drunk the entire ride. This was great.
I feel like Morgan’s vlogs are us just watching her personal Snapchat story
I got my toes done at Mesa Nails last Tuesday!!! When were you there? I'm so angry if I just missed you or didn't see you. 😭😂
I enjoyed watching you girls having a blast! I am an old lady now so it took me back to a time when I was young having a blast with my bestie👍
Girl, zooming in on your face scratch with no explanation and also telling what happened after you got pulled over lol
if nobody got me i know cowboy dave got me
Page Arizona is the Navajo nation. Just in case others weren’t aware!
🤣.... loving this content
omg these road vlogs are the best brings back the Trinity saga series i love Brooke!!
I CANNOT BELIEVE U WERE IN GRAND JUNCTION (i live there lmao hi) this is thee worst town in the whole state :) glad u enjoyed lmao.
Morgan you seem so happy! I loved this video so much!!! Looking forward to your Denver vlogs. My grandparents took us to Estes park growing up it was amazing. You’d love cowboy brad!!!!!!!!!! SERIOUSLY look him up. Cowboy Dave reminded me of a dishelved cowboy brad
I love grandma
This was everything 💕
I’m what happened to Morgan’s face there is a huge scratch.
Colorado drunk is a real ass thing. Having one drink is like having 4.
What’s the song at 1:42 ?
i laughed so hard at best western view
I have been waiting for this since you posted Part 1 and it was so CUTE 🥰 I absolutely loved how much you two laughed throughout this video. You have no idea how much your laughter was contagious and much needed. I wish you the best in your New Beginnings in your new home. Keep your spirits high just like you did during your road trip. Thanks you also to Brooke 🥰
Oh my gawd that was so much fun!
The stoplight was obviously for road construction 🤦🏻‍♀️.   I’m more shocked by the fact that she’s never encountered road construction in her entire life
Brooke is trinity in a blonde wing
Let’s go to an i hop... oh fuck LMFAOO
We shoulda gotta DUMP TRUCK LOL
It's because you have a view of the other best western 🤣
I love Morgan and always enjoy her videos... but these 2 videos were annoying to the point I had to turn it off. Geeez... the best part was the drunk old cowboy dude.
Morgan, I can't thank you enough for these vlogs - I have COVID at the moment and was in need of a good laugh! Lots of love from England <3
Lmfao you saying Ill take my take my home then had me 💀💀! I Love the whole thing
i think you had more fun in the vehicl then you did at youe stopped places. im jealous
Oh poor Morgan….you can still see the stretches on the side of her face!!! Ohh love you Morgan 💜
What happened to your face?? The kids of the canyon came for you 😂
Ur a brave bitch!!! I love u! Ugh
I love Kendall!
U had me rolling the whole video!! I love ur personality♡♡
Fuck this summer job man. Thank you girls for bringing us with you on a road trip. It was fun❤️😁
THIS IS SO STUPID AND CRINGY
Brook and you need to do more videos!
*points right* “bAdDiEs To tHe LeFt” *points left* “baDdiEs To tHe RiGht”
Can Brooke make a comedy channel where she's also the laugh track?
This is genuinely one of your best videos. It's up there with the Trinity camping one. Brooke is everything and I nearly passed out when the iPhone alarm played while you were tryna pee
“Baddies to the left” *pans right* “Baddies to the right” *pans left*
The mid-west Morgan is BEST!!!!!!!!
now why did i get a K-12 school ad the second after they mentioned the school bus 😭
lmao kids of the canyon
Wait what happened to Morgans eye?
Y’all look like sisters lol 😂
Brooke is the ultimate road trip partner
🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤
Kinda hoping the next video starts with you waking up from this bed..lol
I live in Aspen, and it is wicked expensive for a basic room, especially on weekends. Hope you still enjoyed your time in this beautiful town!
I’ve seen those portable traffic lights in Maine… in the mountains when they were doing road work
Colorado is the most beautiful place on Earth. *Fight me*.
How could anyone not love her.  ❤❤❤❤
wow im going to the grand canyon soon looks so cool :00
tell me you showered before you laid on your bed, Or that your going to sleep and you plan to wash your sheets in the morning. lol. It was fun seeing your trip. 😄💗 Thank you for sharing. Love how real you are. So sorry about the scratch on your face from riding the horse. 😔👎🏻 Ouch. Overall seeing how much fun you had with your friend made me want to go on a trip and make memories. lol. xo
Only problem is now the law knows where the cowboy is. He will be calling Morgan for bail money.  Hey Girlie can you spot me and put some money on my commissary 😂
You and Brooke are so funny together! Looks like yall had alot of fun!!!!
Can we all appreciate the fact that Morgan never disappointed us with her content  🤗  🤗  🤗
Y’all are hilarious. Thanks for an afternoon of laughs!!! Thanks Morgan!!!
Am I the only one who wants Morgan to Have Onlyfans
I am having Morgan trinity flashbacks to when you guys did a camping trip 😭
These are my fave vlogs…you and your girlfriends giggling and having fun.
I wish I had a friend like this
NO BC IF MORGAN TRIED TO SING SHE WOULD BE GOOD
I love it but I’m so mad for some reason that u staid at Paige and Moab and didn’t go to see anything.
Can't wait for the house tour.
You don’t like “okie dokie”? 😰
Brooke: They put the traffic light on a tripod and said ‘sure’… Stoplight: 👁👁🛑?
Your Grandmother is so precious. You girls made me laugh 😄 I'm glad y'all are home safe and sound.  Can't wait to see you in your new house!
when morgan is so oblivious to the concept of being on a reservation...
I like Brooke I really do. But where is OUR TRINITY ❤️😭🤣
But wait... Girl... Why WERE you pulled over???
morgan can you stop being so pretty <3
I’m truly confused how she doesn’t have millions of subs?? Like how swayyy!!??
Does anyone know what happened to trinity??
“If you haven’t been here before, well mmmm now you have” 😂😂😂
I appreciate your taking me on this trip with you and Brooke. One of the worse hotel nights I’ve ever experienced was in Denver on a cross country trip from SF to NC. It’s nice to see someone have a lovely landing with wonderful family there! Rest well. Then “Giddaup” and let’s see home renovation!
You will have to give us bestie goodnight kisses every time now, you know that right?
she’s still friends with her other friend right? the one from her town.
Hey girls..gotta go lower or your pants get wet!  Such fun content & beautiful scenery!
Morgan ! When I tell you I went to my cousins in a small town for 4th of July and one of the questions I asked when booking a hotel ... “do y’all have the waffles for breakfast?” I live in Texas so I assumed they’d be Texas shaped and was slightly disappointed when I ate my circular waffle in the morning but I alas it was a waffle ! :) I’ll add this to the list of reasons why we’d be besties .
Morgan singing legally blonde the musical as they walk into Whole Foods was 100 blonde
MORGAN NOOOOOO NO NO you can’t moon the forest.! You have no idea what you’ve just done 😫🙏
The two of you together are hysterical.  That must have been a fun trip.
Not Morgan coming to my hometown and getting her nails done where I get mine done! Upsetting I didn’t get to see you! Should’ve invited me to get some Ale House with you guys!
where’s trinity we miss her
the laughs in this video made me laugh along so haaard
makes me wanna road trip with my bestie sooooooo bad
I love youuuuu lolol awesome vlog. S/O to Brooke. Ur a real one bestie.
If I had the money I should go on a road trip with my bestie. You are truly blessed to have been able to make such wonderful and funny memories 💜🙌🏻
I love traveling but the moment I get to go home and go back to my own bed is one of the best feelings in the world!
I loved this road trip! So funny!
😂😂😂😂😂 omg you came to grand junction I wish I saw youuuu
Morgan talking about my hometown makes me so happy lol- come back to gj for my wedding Morgan!!!
For some reason Trinity doesn't annoy me at all, and for some reason this new bestie does..
Thank you so much for your trip. Seeing mountains in the distance is amazing. I will never visit those places as I'm from the UK so watching this is a great substitute
i miss trinity 😩
I know I’m not the only one who wants to go on a road trip with Morgan and Brooke now
where is trinity? 😭😭
Hey girls so happy for your road trip be safe awesome video
I want more videos of Morgan tripping during road trips
Wait are you not friends with Garrett anymore? 😩
Brooke comes with all the energy- love her! Maybe you two could do a blog with home improvement on your new place. Who knows maybe HGTV will come knocking!
Your laughter is contagious 😆
Show us Colorado, the city part.  My ignorant self thought it was just trees and cows. But then, there's wholefoods! Lol
Moab is so freakin beautiful. Been twice and I wanna go back again
okay but my best friend Brooke is riding with me when I move across the country next week :o
It’s the view for me 🤣🤣
Kids of the canyon 😂
Brook and Morgan’s friendship is everything 🥺🥺 all they do is laugh, I love that❤️ I’m so happy you trusted us with your friends 😂❤️
but this the type of friendship I want
Road trip with Morgan #bucketlist
No lie... I live for Morgan 🍾
Why does Brooke remind me so much of Trinity, have they met? They'd either love or hate eachother 😂
We need more Brooke and Morgan !!
These last two videos have been epic! Keep it up! We love this Chaotic energy ⚡
Day of weekends they put up the plaice cuz they know ppl will not have an option. I world hotels. We would do the same all the time. Every Friday we double or tripled the price, and ppl will take it cuz they had no where else to goz MONEY BABY MONEY!!!!
Now that she's back in Colorado when do we get a Morgan + Kendall Rae collab? 👀🖤
So.... Did u get a ticket? LOL
this makes me want to go on a road trip even tho I get super car sick and have chronic back pain lol
YES HOUSE TOUR ASAP MORGAN!
That "Mobil home with a water slide" .... is actually a house boat. They are popular at Lake Powell and fun A.F. to have on the lake.
If I move can we be best friends 😂love these!
It’s Page, AZ 🤦🏾‍♂️
I work at a hotel. The busier days they will raise their prices, because they know other places will be booked and if you really wanted to stay you will. You have no other options 😂 it’s super greedy and they are taking advantage of the fact there’s no other options 😭
i love brooke so much i’ll miss her!!!!
I want your Aspen sweater lol
yea, love love LOVE Kendall !
This has to be the best and most wholesome outro Morgan has ever made! 🥰🥰🥰
Please do a worst rated nail salon video queen lmaooo
I have questions!! What happened to your face in the Simpsons market scene? Looked like a bad scratch by your eye, I was concerned lol And why yall get pulled over? Was it actually for eating subway while driving? 😅 My life needs these answers.
Awesome job Morgan.
Don't be ashamed I-Hop gets me excited too.
Brooke is alittle obnoxious I’m not sure I can watch this one.. she’s too much…
I worked as a raft guide in Aspen for 5 years and had to drive a freaking mini bus over independence pass almost everyday, every summer haha watching y’all take the pass gave me flashbacks
I like Brooke way more than the other girl you always post on your videos. Bring Brooke on more. :)
ohmygosh please be BEYOND CAREFUL with the “free shots” a family member who runs a bar in a dangerous city said its a dangerous ploy s** Traffickers use it get you disoriented and then they snatch you on the way to your cars.   i avoid all bars after hearing that.  please be cautious and stay safe lovelies 💕
Morgan, I am THRILLED for you! Moving home is going to be so good for your heart and mind. Way to go and congrats on the house! 💝
10:00 i love Kendall’s video’s!!!
Brooke "#*&^%$@!#*&^%$%&*&*#!@!!!!!" for almost a full minute that Morgan had to bleep that out! LOL! I love her and I love you too Morgan! You girls are so fun! I'd love to hang out with you sometime! Oh and Morgan, I haven't forgotten about the pupil thing and I hope you have gotten and MRI because I was really scared for you! Take care of yourself honey and enjoy Colorado! <3
Actually peeing in water is so disrespectful..... Jesus. People baffle me. How would you feel that peeing in water is cleaner than anywhere else??
This makes me want to take a road trip with my bestie
You literally make my face hurt from laughing so hard.
LOVE You and your videos make my day!!! Your awsome!
The places you made fun of in the beginning are a huge part of the Native American reservations. People still live there and they are the poorest areas of America established by your ancestors. Next time educate yourself before you ignorantly joke about people’s livelihoods.
I like to think Morgan is my best friend, but the thought of never meeting said friend makes me sad :((
Bro, why are you so funny 😆
2:25 I like to imagine that Cowboy Dave is also the principle at this school  EDIT: 3:47 and he works at the front desk of this hotel  EDIT EDIT: 4:33 and that mobile home ok sorry I’m done
We used to do road trips all the time. BEST advice for peeing outside is a peei funnel, it’s like a rubber tube, and it will allow you to pee standing up! (You can also get it in paper but those are obviously not reusable) Thank me later :)
If that was bed bugs you're screwed. Sorry chicka
Too bad you didn’t see Moab Utah. It’s one of the 7 wonders of the world... you missed all the good things.
THIS IS SO CHAOTIC
“Baddies to the left” *pans to the right* “& Baddies to the right” *pans to the left* LMAO
❤❤❤❤
Her teeth look fake?
The 42 people that haven’t liked this so far don’t have a sense of humor or personality 🤷🏻‍♀️
Yaaass i was waiting for part 2!!! Love you Morgan!
There's drunk and then there's ColORAdo drunk I never felt anything so true in my life 🤣🤣🤣
Which tripod is that?? I want to attach my phone sitting vertically just like that!!!
Brooke laughing like Andrew Siwicki is my favourite thing in this video
My bestie lives in Grand Junction
Love brook 😂 and of course you Morgan!!
i want to come hang out with you guys so bad. i live in my van in colorado, let me come meet you!
brooke looks like evan rachel wood!
“ my 👀 eyes not so clean” lol 😂 🤣🤣🤣
Morgan singing the Legally Blonde musical…icon
Kendall Rae 😂
💖💖💖
thank you for blessing us with part 2 \o/
Her friends laughter the whole time like “heyeuyheyuheyuheyuhhhhhaaooooo”
Brooke NEEDS her own channel she is so funny 💯🤣
Not the cops in Moab pulling over the blondes “for eating too fresh.” 😅😂🤣
In every town or city they visit morgan is wearing the sweatshirt with the city name on it.
omg that’s the hotel i stayed at in moab😍
I just wanna be best friends with both of you😂 I can't stop laughing😂😂😂   If you ever wanna road trip from Illinois to Colorado, let me know bc I'd be down!!😂😂😂
Not even through the into yet and I just have to say I love you and seeing a new video from you makes my day!!!❤💚💜💙🧡
I love these videos. Please road trip to the east coast and back
When Morgan stops in your town to get her nails done and goes to one of your favorite restaurants🙃
You were born in SLC?? da fok. I live in Utah and wanna live in Colorado. God, Morgan why arent we best friends? I need a bestie to laugh and be dum with
You & Booke are hilarious! Thank you for taking us on your road trip, I had a blast! 😂❤️ xx
Brooke: “don’t piss me ✨off✨” *banshee scream*  😂😂😂
girl. disgusting you can see your leftover used toilet paper on the ground behind you as you leave.. and then just being ok with bedbugs? not a good move bestie
burrito scars<3 n subway?
I hope Morgan knows how insanely beautiful she is
Just curious, what's the difference between this channel and your other one. Low key I was excited you were doing 2 channels because I thought double the videos 😂 I always check just incase 🤣 congrats on everything though!!!
“baddies to the left” *pans right*
Morgan could post a video of her literally doing absolutely nothing but talking about random shit and I promise you I’d still be cry laughing. Most iconic queen ever. 👸🏼
BROOKE DID NOT SAY PERIOD THAT WAS DEFINITELY SOMEONE ELSE
MORGAN! don’t vlog and drive girl it’s so dangerous
I love these videos. Plz keep them coming 💛
Those were Native kids getting on the bus going to school on top of the mountain hill, it’s a cute lil school I’ve went to school there.
Good ol fashion girls trip! One of my absolute favorite things to do. So jealous!
Kendall and Morgaan are my fav 😍
I legit feel like I went on a road trip with y’all
Anyone else notice lights in the sky after leaving the grand canyon? Looks like UFOs to me! 🤔👽
Nature is VERY healing. ✨🦋♥️ love u!!!!!
I love Morgan she is everything
I took a road trip at age 8 with the family from Arizona (where we live) all the way to Calgary, Alberta, Canada (where the rest of the fam lives). Best trip of my life! You should definitely road trip up to Canada sometime. I suggest going to Banff even though it’s very busy since it’s a popular tourist spot. You have to see Lake Louise. It is heaven on earth!
I live for your vlogsss
okay but you and brooke are a vibe
wAit why don't they have masks on I'm so lost pls lemme sob
Who is Brooke and where is Trinity?
I need Morgan to be a guest on The Sesh 🙌🏻
🤍
Omg I live in Grand Junction. Should've said hi lmao
Baddies to the left (pans camera right), baddies to the right (pans camera left)
Haha I’m anti iCloud for no reason too sis 😂
Sorry I love you guys but like have you not ever driven through road construction before?? 😝
This was a very funny series, I cannot wait for the house tour and renovation
these are the best vlogs I’ve ever seen, can you please just road trip across the country for my entertainment 🤣
I don't even know you in person but you're literally my favorite person in the world 😂❤️
This was literally the funniest thing i’ve seen
I could watch you two all day! So fuckin funny!
When THE Morgan Adams was in your town…. I can’t (We do have some pretty decent nail salons tho)
Grand Junction is *chefs kiss*
This looks so fun and so beautiful being able to see the country, I just dont like to drive >.<
Brookes laugh is fucking everything
Love Morgan.❤ But Brooke's constant laughing was kind of distracting. Feel like it was just a video of super loud laughing and shouting.
😂😂😂😂💀💀💀💀
Go to a haunted hotel please. Ghosts would love to party with you.
I love brooke’s laughhhhhh
Pulled over for eating too fresh 😅 loving these vlogs! ❤️
I fricken love you, you’re an amazing person and so genuine and never forget to be yourself because you’re amazing ❤️
The end of the video comes near and I always find myself  craving more MorganVlogs.
You didn’t tell us why you got pulled over. I hope you didn’t get a ticket
Tell me you’ve never gone to the bathroom in the woods, without telling me you’ve never gone to the bathroom in the woods 😑
We love gram 🥺♥️
Genuinely sad I’m not part of this road trip gang 🥺❤️
Me watching the video the whole time 😐 y’all try too hard to be funny I swear
GRANDMA!
Omg so fun to watch 😂😂😂😂
So you both got black out drunk in Aspen where you 2 were the only females in the bar and you aren't a little bit concerned about what may have went down while you were there? This isn't a judgmental question. No judgment. I legit don't think altitude has anything to do with how drunk someone feels. I would be concerned about things being put in your drinks for real.
Yes, house tour!
I can just imagine someone calling the cops to report an abandoned vehicle on the side of the road and the police come and see you peeing 😅
Where’s trinity ! 😭🥺
I SAW U I was in Vegas the same time u were and thought I was delusional now I feel better knowing  I’m sane but at same time wish I never know cuz now that the biggest L I ever took. 😂 with love from Denver & Orange County ❤️❤️
I love these videos! You ladies are so entertaining!
Sooo glad y'all made it safely home! Goodd times! 🐈🐾💙🐦🍀🌱💛
Your a fun girl!! So glad your out of LA.
Can I ask what the brush thing is you dry your hair with Morgan please? I want to see if they have one in UK. I had a babyliss spinning one years ago, but it was so mega mega hot
I will NEVER live up to the Morgan and Morgan's Vlogs.. and I'm okay with that
Gosh girl you should’ve done anything to find sneakers and enjoy grand canyon!
Love you Morgan 💜
OK BUT AM I THE ONLY PERSON WHO GOT THE LEGALLY BLONDE REFERENCE AND SCREAMED ORRRRRRR????
Wait, what's up with that scratch near your eye, did I miss something?
I LITERALLY COULD OF MET MORGAN I LIVE IN GRAND JUNCTION COLORADO AHHHH IM SO MAD 😭😭😭
Thats so funny, I stayed in that hotel last year in Moab... there were bugs.. but they didn't have that sign 😂  and we complained about them.. I wonder we were apart of the catalyst behind the sign lol
Y'all ever notice how she thinks everything is a disaster?  ❓
NOT A LEGALLY BLONDE THE MUSICAL REFERENCE
Traveling with u guys would be a blast ha 😊
wait did that hotel have bed bugs 😬
She goes watch for rocks lol the rock lives here??? Lol 🤣🤣 I hope u love the big AZ. U make me miss my home on the Navajo nation.
Morgan! I love to see you happy!!! Can’t wait for house tour
ive been waiting for this
Drive back through and see the Four Corners, Monument Valley and Antelope canyon to name a few. The Navajo reservation is quite beautiful!
Morgaaaaan Brooooooke, the kids come to visit the canyon, I assume, in the school bus.
The amount of excitement you get for the continental breakfast’s waffle iron  is LITERALLY my mood when I go too! Omg!! I hype it up all night until the morning of 🤣
So many hilarious moments!! I love your videos
This is literally so funny
So exciting!!!! Yay more Morgan
Can’t wait to see your new house!!!!
Honestly feels like I’m on a road trip with friends while I’m stuck at home with my kids. Thank you Morgan 🤣 living for this
Wait I have to know, why did you get pulled over and did you get a ticket? 😆 LOVED the video laughed so hard
Oh my goodness, now I truly miss .y youth. Craziness and all you  & Brooke looked like you had a blast.
Morgan singing Legally Blonde is so cute
Loved this Road trip because I never been to any of those places or or states so it was nice to get a peak at them. Can't wait for the house tour. Love ya Morgan.💖
It’s not littering if it is biodegradable!
Hell yeah!!! My day just got 10000 times better! Thanks Morgan! 🥰
Please keeping enjoying and filming. It does make ME happy and laugh much needed. No pressure, just be you.
Lol that’s not a mobile home with a slide, it’s a house boat!
Dude this dynamic Duo, I LOVE 😂🤍
OLLY has big bottles! Omg. I collect the containers because they are great for seasonings and such. But now?! I can put cat food in those! (I want to try the protein supplement too)
Awe sweet Morgan getting emotional♥️ Ilove you girlie kisses back💋💋💋
Much love to you💖
Dude Kendall Rae is my Jaaaaaammmmm
Morgan on a Kendall Rae video is not the way I would expect they collab lol!
"kendall rae video" I'm dead
This was fun! The amount of laughing 😂 you did = priceless 👏🏻 😂 ❤️ your road trips
We appreciate you!
Just went through a terrible bed bug situation and I can’t believe you’re not paranoid about those bugs!!! I would’ve thrown all my clothes in the washer and dryer straight might as well put myself in the dryer too 😭😭😭
What a journey.  I loved it.  Sending love from Germany 😊💕
Omg I freaked out about the Larissa earrings xD I love!!!
Still doing better than myself who hasn’t moved out of home yet at 26
morgan watching kendal rae in a hotel is a mood
So much fun. Morgan you have the greatest eyebrows!
Can’t wait for the house tour!
What I've learned from this video is that I need to go on a road trip with Morgan!
"That mobile home has a slide on it" that's a house boat 😂
One word ... She-Wee
I NEED TO BE UR BFF
Morgan is legit my most favorite vlogger, her energy is a mood all the time and she's just so gorgeous!! 🥰❤️
When I was 19, (2019) I did a cross country road trip from western New York all the way to Nevada and back with my grandparents and Colorado was my absolute favorite. I can’t even describe the feeling I got literally the second we crossed the state line. Utah was pretty high up there for me too and this is making me miss that trip so much!
“Baddies to the left” *pans right* “Baddies to the right” *pans left*
God ily
Morgan! I am only over in Greeley and I work down in Adams county all the time as a process server…if you EVER need any extra girl power for stuff in your place, hmu :) or just hit a trail. Whichever 😌
The best duo, y’all are so funny together😂
Baddies to the left *goes right* baddies to the right *goes left*
I love you too, Morgan! 🤗
I moved from Iowa to Colorado beginning of this year. Best decision ever made, love it here! Love you too Morgan, you always make boring days better. ❤️
You and Brooke have the same chaotic energy as me and my old friend lol 😂
I feel like if I was friends with Morgan my depression would be cured loll
I got food poisoning last night and was puking my guts out for 8 hours. I needed this video for a laugh 😂 thanks morgie 🤠
That amount of groceries, bought at Whole Foods...Morgan has BANK!!! :O
It bothers me that you thought that stop light was a permanent feature of whatever town you were near. It was for one-way traffic during road construction, so a temporary set-up. Thus the jankiness.
Omggggg love this series Morgan 💖🌺🌿🦥✌🏻🙃love you girly you are my fav YouTuber 😘
Does the Rock live here?? "Ba Dum Tsss!"
im sorry but what is this cute little town at 8:06 😭😭
I love you two together ❤️
not me already binge watching her channel when she posted this 💀
Oh, you giggling girls are a hoot. Road trip
To have a friend.
Haha love this video Morgan you and Brooke are so funny .I do have a question is she moving in with you or just moving to Colorado
perfect you just posted this because I just watched part one
I feel like I got a happy hug from Morgan, Brooke and Cowboy Dave! 🤠
Ma’am that mobile home is a house boat
I honestly don't know how you're single
Living your best life! Awesome to go on the journey! Glad you 2 made it safe... did you get a ticket?
Can I please be y’all’s 3rd best friend I’m here in Colorado too😂💀
So I’m from page Arizona and I want to say the part where she was filming with the Simpson market is called cameron in the Navajo nation and I go there a lot because we’re Native American and we own property there (also I’m so surprised that my favorite YouTube went to my town)
New game! Just listen to this video and guess what is visually going on.
Colorado drunk is the best drunk, fight me.
My grandma used to keep an empty coffee van in her car and would sit on it while she was driving if she had to pee hahahahaha
Not a huge fan of road trips but would be SO DOWN to go on one like this! Laughed right along with you two throughout the whole video! You look so genuinely happy about this move. So happy and excited for you!
Loved the Omigod You Guys reference from Legally Blonde! You are too funny!❤️❤️
Never pee in the water...pee is pollution.. especially if you're taking medications.  I think it's at least 100 ft away from running water, but definitely not in it! 🐟
Page Arizona not Page UT…
Omg, girl you put the wrong info for Brooke’s IG. I literally followed some rando lmao
morgan you seriously make the most interesting and funny videos. underrated af
Super excited for the house tour with Ryland!
916th person to like
I worked at a motel as the manager.  I could change the price anytime I wanted.  If it was getting booked and only a few rooms left, I raised the price.  During special events, it's even more.  I had one room left during a special event and it was the only room available in the whole surrounding area, so I charged $500 for a normally $69 room.
Morgan I love you so much,  adore you so much, appreciate you so much, and am so very proud of you! 💜 Thank you so much for taking us on this amazing journey with you! So excited to go along with you on your country life adventure 💛
Morgan the flip flops are no excuse, I HIKED the grand canyon in flip flops and I'd say I preferred it actually.
Omg I love Kendall Rae :D
Ok but brooke makes me so happy
I hope your cut heals up. I love all your videos, you always seem so genuine and we need more people like that to influence others to be their self
The editing is on point girl!!!
glad you made it home safe  good vid
The way you said, "Colorado drunk," made me laugh! It's so true!
Brooke scream-laughing 😂
Good grief, I’m early. Morgan, I am LOVING your experiences! Remember to keep safety in mind somewhere 🥰
Woooshhh!! Thank you!! I needed a break from today!! 🙌🏼✨💖
not morgan saying "baddies to the left" while moving the camera to the right queen✨
Thank you for making me laugh out loud for the first time in a while ❤️
This has me dreaming of my next road trip with my bestie
It looks like you had a great time with your bff.  Nothing like a good old road trip with a friend to make it a lot less boring.
Morgan, girl, just ditch those nails! You're gonna be cleaning, hammering, painting, and unpacking soon.  No nails needed! Ps, that mobile home with the slide is a houseboat.
Bestie Road Trips are the best!  Making memories of a lifetime.😊
Wait I say "Okie dokie" well I usually say "Okie dokie karaoke"... hmm maybe that's why I don't have friends 🤔😂
EVERYONE STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING MORGAN POSTED!! Love your vlogs always Morgan :)) <33
not cowboy dave at the end 😌🤚
IM DYING THAT SHE LINKED THE WRONG INSTA

Omg lolPlease be my friend Lmfaoooo I loveeeee youuuuu lmfao your energy is so fuking contagious
I sadly had  to skip 3/4 of this video. To much dumb / say the wrong word , laughing at nothing , I’m hip bullshit bullshit bullshit….. the formula doesn’t work anymore. Also I’m just as disappointed they didn’t find an IHOP
Okay ladies... here's how you pee on a road trip. You pull over along the side of the road and open the passenger side front and back door.... then you squat, wipe, and pull pants back up. People may have an idea of what you're doing, but they can't actually see you in your little three sided hut of shame.
Baddies to the left 💫looks right💫   Baddies to the right 💫looks left💫
AHHHH THANK YOU MORGAN!! You're vids always make us laugh and smile which is just what I need right now so thank you again😊We wish you all the positivity in the work and hope you and everyone reading this has and amazing day as well❤️🙏

Bitch I gasped I love your ghetto ass road trip vlogs
Girl the stop light is just a temporary one for road construction. 😂
Oh my god, I had the same problem as your double Best Westerns - there are two Motel 6's in the Orlando area ON THE SAME STREET. Took an Uber back one day, spent 10 minutes looking for my hotel room, then had to call ANOTHER Uber to go to the OTHER Motel 6.
Soon as I saw your post on Instagram I hoped on.
KENDALL RAE IS MY QUEEN
Maybe that random light was for people to u-turn. Otherwise, idk why that’s there lol
Omg it's been so long since I've watched your videos I missed them so much 😂❤️
