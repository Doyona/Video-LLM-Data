You and Wax need to do a song together or his brother Herbal T... even better bolth of them! 😂🔥
Only the black community would praise a certified crack-head.
I love the puppies in this.  I love how they didn't make them mad to make them look tough. Anyone who is smart and knows dogs knows that if you hurts something they love, that sweet puppy will be no more.
Reminds me of Mad Child from Swollen Memebers.
Songs.good videos dead

PUDDING WHERE ARE YOU
Don't get me wrong webbys a good rapper and I have mad respect for DMX, may he rest in peace, but there's one detail in this video that I DO NOT agree with, correct me if I'm wrong but does anyone get the message they support dog fighting????
I miss X so much 😔
Blessing from mother as always...💗🙏
It’s crazy how far you have come and the respect you have earned over the years but this proves how much you are a real hip hopper
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥

We miss DMX 🙏🙏
DMX PROUND
Amazing
Bro Its crazy how that ruff Ryder hits nostalgic these days

Webby is decent but it still pisses me off that he makes mentions lyrically about being Italian and how being Italian makes it glamorous to commit violent crimes.   I guess its no different to how Black people don't always appreciate hip hop because it makes the image as if they're all criminals.  How is it that the only Italian-American representations in media are portrayals in Gangster films and rappers talking about how glamorous it is to be a fucking criminal😂 How are people supposed to break that stereotypical image?
Rip dmx
Still repping CT. Home home fs.
This should be in everyone’s rotation 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Why is your Boy twisting those fingers throwing Royal??
I was listening to Chris Webby when he was crashing datpiff, he still going strong as hell, he's worked with alot of people. Rip DMX
Yo yo love the J.B at the start yes 🎉🎉🎉
I love webby much as the next cunt, anyone else sus on these comments?

That’s kinda promoting suicide web by
Too bad webby sucks these day..i miss this shit
Heard the marbled sack escrits the pass deep sad we got it millan hilt station
Stop being greedy was a fav of DMX back in the day and caught Webby off random pandora and first loved the political songs but all of his stuff is so fucking good, and I haven’t been a fan of any rap since the 90’s. About to get a big ass sticker for my semi to help get Webby as well known as one of the most talented and missed, DMX
D to the M to the X !!! ruff riders 4ever !!!

~my favorite part of the Video is when U had the Dog rapping DMX verse....LOLOLOL...That was hard...LOLOL...Imma borrow that idea if I ever feature a DMX verse on my future songs..lololol...the story has been told of one of DMX's dogs adlib'n his raps in a Rap Battle or Rap Cypher on a street corner in Harlem, NY....LOLOLOL...The Legendary DMX may have been the Dog-Whisperer aka Dr. Doo Little of the Dog Kingdom-world...LOLOL...Rest in Power to the Iconic Earl Simmons aka DMX....1LOVE

Thanks for always reppin CT Webby
am I the only one that can never take rappers seriously? sometimes I wonder if they're sitting there, editing videos in their Care Bear pajamas. don't get me wrong, Webby is good at what he does, but I just don't think he's out there smashing crap up and painting things over, while "ridin' wit da homies."
2 of the BEST. That's Salt n pepper right there. Too bad the greatest X is gone. Smh. Miss ya fam. RIP
Still ☝️ of my favorite
Rip X ❤️🙏🏻 wish he could’ve been in the video. Webby held it down. 🔥🙏🏻

I believe this song would have DMX’s stamp of approval for sure!! RIP DMX! One of the deepest lyricists of our time, gone way too soon!  It makes me laugh to think now as a 35 yr old.. You know damn well DMX had no idea he was even reaching the young teenage whits girls from middle of nowhere western NYS. 🤣
EightyHD… Webbys We Up !!
DMX was taken from us for being too honest & not scared to talk truth! Definitely one of the greatest artists of all times!  May you be at peace in the kingdom of Heaven! Can't wait to meet you in this next life that awaits I bet you have amazing stories lol! Much Love and Respect to you X & your Family! God bless 👊🏽💯🍻🕊
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥‼️
That merl pitty is absolutely beautiful
Man all Webby songs should have 5million plus views ..... At least us 100,000 die hard Webby fans will watch over 100 times to give it millions of views.,...... Most underrated rapper in the world.
I myself knowing the history of how both these guys grinded and made it .Makes me happy to say that's the best song in the last ten years.Its X in his absolute comfort zone and he always it.Webby just showed he can hold his own to without question one of the g.o.a.t.s.
💪🩸🇺🇸🌹☘️💯💎
Ngl it hurt when dmx said "think about your kids, is it worth the loss?" When he told his own son that hes never getting sober, and "see you at my funeral" :(
That is 100% a slim shady beat .   Dmx is one of my favorite rappers .   fucking good shit .
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥‼️
Does this song have copyright
Paying homage to X def felt it when X verse hit different DMX def stay in my playlist right there w/ Webby
Woof!
Fucken 🔥, Webby Killen the industry  F. T. I.

The dog was rapping too
This joint is tuff
LETS GO THIS IS 🔥
Dog 4 Life ❌️
God helped me find this song
Had to pause the video just to say respect 🙏  Keep this spirit of DMX Ruff Ryders we all riders music 🎶 alive please  DMX changed the game in the early 2000s the way Dave Chappelle was doing except he was killing em softly, right  Breaking down divisions set up by the politicians with incredible art and talent.  Saw DMX briefly in an AZ jail during a transfer and remember thinking how much bigger he carried himself than his physical stature, mans was surrounded by SRT and they make anyone look small anyway.  He said that he everytime he came to AZ he went to jail and was going to start flying around that mf state all together 🤣  RIP to a real one.
It's a little funny that the car they are destroying, is the same kind as the car I drive, and I would love to destroy it after the years I've had it and the problems its given me.
"Spit it so cold you could feel it where your cavities used to be" 🔥🔥🧯
It took me 32 years to find my soul that was gene created by the government owned scientest. (Rose 1989) My entire life i was a prisoner from the world, finding out on my own after finding hidden zoom light bulbs cameras in my own home. I didnt realize moving didn't make  a difference when I found my entire life iv been 24 hour survalinced studied and a humanized labrat for the gov. Scientest in the USA and possibly Canada. There gene program of how they controlled me, brain washing me, controling my phone, media i am alowed to search online, hiding important information, liying and making sure i dont find out who and what i am,, using the people all around me I thought were my friends, fk I'm a idiot, I put my family threw hell these past few years because they wouldn't believe me always telling me it's the drugs. Yes I agree but I only discovered the truth now. The USA gov created a spidy circle jerkong cult to swallow me up (Kass:control,humilate,make the public hate me, stage and set me up for failer, tried to make me commit crimes, tried to get me to do harder drugs, stole from me, abused me over and over mentally physically etc fked world to destroy me)  C.A.F.E. You all have been lied to about me so you won't believe the truth. They helped silence me from knowing the truth so I could not speak the truth while they slowly make me suffer and iv lost EVERYTHING. This past 3 years have been a living nightmare, iv been home less this past year couch surfing sleeping on the streets a few nights... iv been trying to survive. The hospital would not even take me when I tried to admit my self into the mental institution after i told them what I thought was going on and how I have tried to commit suicide countless of times this past 2 years. I new I was being humiliated, what did they do with all the illegal hidden recorded footage of me. 24 7 of me in my own person home I had no knowledge of, never approved or would even alow to be recorded. I was never paid or made a single dollar. Dame webby I need to get a hold of you and tell and show you proof.
All I can say is oh wow
He struts all macho, but he cries around his girlfriend. They all  do.
Theres no stopping chris webby.. fucking legend

The DAWG will live forever!!! Rip Mr Earl 'DMX' Simmons. DMX was my first rap CD Album I bought from the store. My first CD I ever bought was Cypress Hill, which was used from a student at school. Before that it was tapes I recorded from my older sisters, I had 2 live crew in elementary school. I'm from a desert town north of LA, a mix of country, suburban, and urban that have flocked there.  I come from a place that had constant race riots or threats of riots on the monthly in HS from 90-94 which my sisters would experience. Then 96 I'm in the same HS and it's completely different. There was the 'cliques' of course and majorally speaking people would stick to their own kind, and majorally speaking we would all respect each other.  My opinion why is because of media, specifically music and movies. Anyway, I can go on with my bio, I won't though.  First, I don't consider myself a hip hop head or anything, I'm not even a student of music. I'm really just a consumer of great music, whatever genre it may be.  Chris, it kinda sucks to admit, but I just got introduced to your music this year. Better late than never though!!! I just heard your lyric from 'raw thoughts,' that says "I keep digging for truth, and when I find it, I'll share it with you." Every song I've heard from you touches me better than the way my uncle never did. Hahaha I mean that, really. I've been having a rough few weeks, I had "Pennywise, Society," playing on repeat today which soothes my soul. Along with your music, it's comforting to know people out there that care and are rocking it in life!!!  Much love!!!!
Lost my kids twice now I found the light 💡 Only through Jesus Christ

CS:GO with old school. Very nicely done.
Cool
@WEBBY Hey, new fan here. Question for you and the rest of the industry (Tom, Bryson, Tyson, MESUS, Forgiato, etc.). Do y’all know what Blackrock is? The puppet masters. I know you know who the elite are. I’m just thinking, ya know, left, right, up, down, it’s all the same. It’s what they want us to focus on and doesn’t matter which side so long as we’re pitted against each other, right? What we need instead is a common enemy to bring us together. The way the vax mandates have done with the Canadian truckers and US joined. Nobody gives a damn what political side anyone is on anymore when we’re united and focused on one cause. What blackrock and the rest of the elite (Gates, Rothschild, etc) are doing while we’re buying into their political soap opera BS, is what we need to unite against. Blackrock is buying up all the houses while Gates is acquiring land. Why? Check it out. Shine some light on this little known conspiracy (Not a theory). When I first shared an article about this, I could share to as many as I wanted. A few hours later I went to share some more and they limited me to 5 at a time. 🤔😠   I hope you see this. Don’t know where is the best place to reach you. K well, love ya! Peace 🤟🏼✌🏼
✌️❤💪⚡
i have one thing to say dmx is the all might pitbul boss in the rap game even though the rapper pittbull announced his name as pittbull but still dmx is more feirce then him anyday and webby deserves some serious props for this video the way you used dmxs voice with the pitbull bark thats mean as f@$* man and you have no idea what you created here but still dont stop the style its what some people need to see and hear

Song is bad ass!!  I wasn't very happy after DMX his music label released an ep less then 2 hours after he passed..  They said nothing about proceeds go to family or nothing if would have I could of respected the release but nothing was said... The ep was all spoken word sermons/prayers.  BTW.. Song has 509 dislikes..

RIP DAX  Rough Raiders
Big respect 🙏 rest in peace DMX. 🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
X voice still give me the chills...🙊👀👈
R.I.P. to the Legend. Such a horrible lost, damn. This one verse is better than all DMX's posthumous realease. No disrespect to Swizz, but this Earl's record materal was too raw for an album. Also, music video is a great tribute to Ruff Ryders movement and the D's legacy. It means a lot... Chris Webby, you made a dope song, man.
For sure💪 Likey &  Loza collab would be dope. Patriots
Mad respect to Webby 4 the DMX bars…!!!
Ruff Ryders https://youtu.be/7GF5wAFctxk 👨🏾‍🌾🎆
The collab I didn't even know I needed!🔥 RIP DMX
This is maddd fire bruh 🔥🔥🔥 keep it upp Webby
BRO. That scene with the dog doin X's lines? GREAT.
Webby the fucking GOAT man !!
🌘💚🌒
Na you haven't got the sound webby ... Listen to DAX that's where it's at
Just took a trip to the dawg pound. I remember when he was kicking ass in action movies.
The best tribute hands down...bringing back Toxic Masculinity 🔥
Fire
Thank you
Wooooo💯🔥Almost 500k let's gooooo
i cant stop listening to this... the beat the flow, holy shit.
Is it just me or does the dog rapping bring tears to your eyes
Fire🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
RIP X 🔥🔥
DAVE RUFFIN ON THE BEAT.  DMX BROUGHT ME TO JESUS. I SOLD MY SOUL AND MY FLESH TO DRUG ADDICTION. THEN DMX DIED AND I CRIED AND PRAYED. And I saw him here on YouTube. He was calling people to GOD AND JESUS. I answered the call and got my soul back. I owe my sobriety to DARKMAN. THIS IS THE TRUE LEGACY OF OUR BELOVED BROTHER DMX...BRINGING PEOPLE TO GOD AND JESUS. BLESSED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT. AMEN. DMX....ADVANCE STRAIGHT TO HEAVEN!
Webby always 🔥
such a great hype up song
RIP X
Wtf😂😂😂😂😂😂

No lie this DMX verse sounds a lot better that his verses in his album. I don't think they were done 100%
Rest in peace DMX 💔
u def hurting feelings every week cmon mayne it take rappers a year to drop something like this
I still don't understand how Webby don't got a million subs, been listening since 2010 and I just feel selfish and humble I've seen him grow so much as a man and artist. Keep it up, dont stop til you drop Webby!!
Any dog can growl or bark but when DMX growled or barked..  Everyone even your favorite rapper heeded the warning. Long live the mightiest of the Dogs king X
Dmx is a legend 🇮🇪
Good to hear X again.
This is absolutely great song but I also get vibes of "Riders on the strom" by snoop dog ft the Doors of the beat 😅😎
GREEN LIVES MATTER COME FIND ME
Long live the Dog
Legendary
Man this song goes hard, so much love to DMX on his last recorded feature, but i just cant get over how the verse and instrumentals go so hard and then there’s just that shot of the dog lookin so happy
Webby dropping three new tracks tonight! Fuck yeah !
You're a legend for this bruh I love how the dog was rapping at first when his verse came on
I don't think you know how awesome this song is to ME U KILLED DA #HOOKNVIBECHALLENGE 4 DA KING #RIPDMX N #SALUTECW💯💯💯💯💯💯✔🐇👊👀🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❌💛💛💛💛🙌🙏🚀
R.I.P X
FuggnEh young byyy
So cold you can feel where your cavity used to be.... That's cold
This one keeps growin on me, I keep coming back, hear it in my head n shit at work.  DMX tha GOAT,  Chris Webby tha MAN!
I hate rap now, but I still check on Chris webby.  Comparing him to others is like comparing real firearms  to  airsoft guns, there is no comparison Period
Serious 🔥.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
💯🎉❤iT
Dope as fuck!!🔥💯 webby kill this shit!😈🔥 sick beat⚡
RIPDMX
I got goosebumps after hearing DMX, RIP
What happen to dmx
Definitely did X justice with your bars and this video!
year of webby
Long live DMX🔥🔥🔥🔥. Much respect for the love Webby… banger this song 🙌🏿🙌🏿🔥🔥🎉 X
Есть рэп для перевода для вас уверен 😉🔓🎶
The worst part of the feds being on you for 7 years for littarally no reason is they destroy your life and fake kill off all your friends that were feds, and they just stop paying attention and look at you crazy like you weren't just the mission.
Dammmm that pitbull scene that was ill! Im 17 and I almost had the chance to work with X but he told me he don't work wit minors... and he wanted 1200 for a song lmao
Badass
Webby is fucking slept on, how this track dont got a mill ore two views by now blows my mind! RIP Dark Man X Your sorely missed DOG (HARDEST MC TO EVER BLESS A MIC)
Lock head martin careful when your cars starts an , I heard you ain't think there's no competition, we already paid off the judges so I don't know.why you think you'd be ever winning .I can tell ya this right from the beginning your cash is nasty an your team is never winning. I could pitch this game from the frist to the 9th inning .
Dmx you rap quick but I heard you an Chris ain't legit. TECH 9
Chris you ain't never gonna catch emenims positions. Sorry brother
Great job bro🔥🔥🔥🔥!!!!X the great nobody sound like him,my heart s always broke,you miss me sooo much!!!lovvvvvve u dog god bless u 4 ever!!!
An Dmx tech nine wants to know if you wanna rap about them ??
Eminem says he's so much better then you Chris. Please don't say you have no competition
🖤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
IS OK MON
Maybe it's just not showing me the number, but I don't see a single dislike on this video! That's damn near impossible on YouTube. It's nice to see you pull down a legend like DMX. I hope more people find your work because of this, your turn to shine is long overdue.
R.I.P. DMX
Man, I've been thinking of DMX a lot this last week...
ooooo that beat
Wow
Xxxxxxxxxxxxxx hoes  run my ................ Pandora box
Man, I was jammin and Crying at the same time listening to this. DMX was one of my favorite Rappers growing up. The fact that his last Song/Collab was with my modern day favorite made this song something special for me. Huge Thank You to Chris and DMX. I. Personally needed this as I've been struggling mentally. R.I.P Earl "DMX" Simmons. Long Live The Dog!!!
#nolifeshaq
Chris you need to do a feature with Drag-On
This my made eyes leak bro. I miss the days of good!
This dude jus keeps coming with more fire..betta than Eva yo..God bless 🙌
He killed this verse too
Webby always kills it ..but to hear DMX ..fucking flawless 🔥
rip dmx you r still with us and this is your immortality🙏
Gained even more respect for Webby because the timing of the release of this single with X is as respectful as can be. Didn't do it right after he passed for views and clout. He waited. Webbys the fucking man.
"Fuck drippin I'll have a n*gga Squirtin sauce" X will forever be missed
This shit knock
R.i.p. DMX. For this video I must say ain't feeling it cause of the bullshit bullies in it. Should've had real a.p.b.t's in it!
Dope ass song keep it up webby
Would love if u came to Cheyenne WY. we need a dose of you and this town needs a real rapper to run thru much love webby!!!!!!
Honestly probably Webbys biggest feature so far , he's collabed with lots of legends ,
If this was true people was actually doing something about all this human trafficking, my mother would be free if it was so true my mother wouldn't be fighting for her life in ICU in a coma right now I don't understand how one person can be trafficked in every single way a human being can be trafficking and then torture to her death and covered up by the law that is supposed to protect us We live in a world for the law protects the criminals and allows them to commit unthinkable inhumane crimes MUCH 💞 LOVE
Lol much love always ME Damn I miss D  R.I.P. My Dawg..
want to give me that xterra you beat to shit? lol could use some parts still
Tacke cares you yours think😍🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
There's a big difference between confidence and arrogance. Dope song though!!
🖤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love how ya pay homage to a legend... WHAT!!!!!!
Webby 100% my top #1 dead or alive !
DMX verse golden. Webby I've never been a fan of and will never be a fan of because he soft. I listened because of DMX. NOT webby.
Fire as fuck
Webby and berner are the rap version of hst and oscar zeta acosta. We gotta get a proper dual album between those two legends. For psychedelic culture
Damn good shit dmx verse was the shiznit
Rest In Peace DMX🙏

Christian could have easily capitalized on this feature by putting it out right after DMZ passed. I have have tremendous respect for him for respectfully delaying it's release. I'm proud of you Chris!
At least he with boom now 1 love boomer rip x

Garbage
DMX was making his comeback, did the versus battle with Snoop, new album coming out, documentaries and a few movies and now he’s gone?
I love the homeage to DMX man! Big up Chris!
Eso eres
😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹
DMX is at 1:49 save your ears 👂

It’s a shame that just saying Tom Mac Donald’s name almost doubled your followers, you deserve better.  One of the best of all times
X = G.O.A.T 🏆 ❤️
That beats cold
Absolute fire bro!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥 Thank you for the DMX tribute. He was a legend💯 Been listening to your songs for about a month now and let me tell you I'm a big fan and you're going big my friend
X
One day Im gonna spit the web w the web.... And it'll be all over the web... JS! Xo
This is legendary 🔥 Track
Good song, not too thrilled DMX was placed in the video as a poorly done CGI dog but I understand the appeal. No complaints about the music. Definitely some good bars in there.
Am I the only one who thinks it would have been dope to hear Webby let out a couple DMX barks? His raspy voice is fitting for it!
Automatic Classic!
Bro I’ve regularly checked in with you to see if your dropping. Ever since I heard “ injure you “ way back in the days 👍🏼🇦🇺  thanks for the dope shit !
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 YES ! love this webby if you can please make a song about this plandemic shit going on in Canada too... Our PM is a fking racist ass pedophile joke that idolizes china and is sending us into a spiral of control dictatorship communist medical segregation that's getting way out of hand 👏
Fucking fire..
Rip to the legend!  Awesome song!
Anybody know we’re the California chapters are Oakland ? Ruff ryders
RIP DMX.. Man im so happy this ended up being so good! keep doing what your doing man ! support will always be here!

This is good...knees weak arms are heavy, moms spaghetti, there's vomit on his sweater already
Wow. Thank you for getting this done while it could be done. Its a masterpiece of course.
Love that shit! Thanks! Where y’all from?
Wow 2 days and nobody has hit the dislike I’m literally surprised that’s a YouTube Anomaly
Been a while about time 👍
This video was shot at my jobsite. I remember showing up on Monday and seeing that Nissan all smashed and tagged up.  We just figured it was another day in Waterbury 🤣
🤘🔥
This song is so 🔥🔥🔥 in everyway. R.I.P. to X.
R.i.p DMX
You got tons of respect for me from this song X was and still is one of the best in my books

Fuckin A! Had a shitty day, this picked me right up! Two legends one track. Also first new track I heard since X passed away…. When da dogs verse started gave  me goosebumps. That shit hit the spot right!🔥🔥
This is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥!!!!
I like how DMX came in and the dog barking. Looked like it was DMX. As the dog. Nice.  Rip dmx.

This shit hard asf
A man with room to think is a master piece
Ruff ryderz
Absolute 🔥
💯❤️⚡
This is great. Is on replay
Waiting for a music artist to grow some balls and finally say the word nigga is a noun in 2021thanks to the rap game, but not a single one is true to themselves or the world. Might be a good song but this is a disgrace to use this word when we are still in this time of the fake BLM that's just elite wearing black face to an everybody problem to keep us singing the same dumb shit to start our own race war because we are to ignorant to even see this word was a noun well before 2021.........
So we got extra X verses just chilling out there? Ok ok I’m down with that
banger!!!!!
2nd lame of the day
Dmx verse was garbage
Chris webby is corny
Thank you Webby 👏🏾👏🏾🔥🔥
Rip x he woulda been proud of this white boy
Best song you dropped in a month. How on earth you got the mans last words I dont want to know.
Webby always putting out the fire music on god keep that shit up Bro you’re a legend same to you DMX

CRINGE. Delete this big dawg
Rest In Power DMX! This was great to hear!
Legendary!!!🖤🙏🏻
DMX, Thank You guys for keeping his words Alive. Long Live. And God Bless and Keep , all us truth spillers. Amen
Webby is so 🔥🔥🔥 literally every song is so Nasty I’ve been a fan since his “The white noise  lp” album back when he was at Hofstra and he’s easily my favorite artist of all time nasty punchlines and speaks real shit unlike these whack mumble rappers now days that get radio play for garbage shit smh. But like Webby says in his song “Go” “shit wack artists Just a bunch of Oscar the Grouch mothafuckas y'all garbage” 😂  I look forward to Webby Wednesdays every week 🔥🔥
Excellent ! 🙏🔥 | Tycs

Unpopular opinion- The discombobulated DMX verse was the most ineffectual portion of this track.
DMX for life he still lives on 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Webby and x....bro im dead! This song plays after flesh of my flesh....

Rough Riders Forever
tbh chirs webby sounds a bit like X's Damien voice , Rest in Power DMX
Dope AF!

Been listening since La La LA. Never thought he'd do a song with dmx
RIP dmx this was a banger. That guy wearing his cut backwards was bugging me. Either wear it right or hold it up backwards. The pitbull as dmx was badazz.
Why you gotta do the Xterra like that 😭
Oh it's so nice to hear X voice again. Hearing this raw ass verse just reminds me that hip hop ain't never going be the same again. Man still missing you X, continue resting and being at peace dawg. It was real nice to hear your voice, one last time🙌🙌🙌🙌🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀💙💙🙏🙏🙏
This is un fuckin believable webby! You're raw as fuck but to drop a gem with the dark man Himself is unbelievable. This joint is cold af.

I'm gonna call it now...you heard it here first this is gonna be one of the songs 20 years from now we all play as classics like outkast does now
Amazing feature, webby going places!
Tough, this was well done
thanks for that sound, a big fan of brazil 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Would appreciate it if you would check out my first song I rapped and produced. All love!!! https://youtu.be/5v0oTzZTvKc
This song goes hard as fuck and it dropped on my firstborns birthday so I’ll take that as a good sign
Absolutely one of my favorites of yours now Webby 🔥❤️, rest in peace DMX🙏🏻🙏🏻
So dope Webby collabed with DMX.
WE UP 💯🔥🔥🔥💯
Love that sh**** 💯🐾🔥🔥🔥🔥⚔️....
RIP DMX
I had the pleasure of meeting and filming with DMX when he was recording his last album in the studio with artists like T.I. The man was a legend for sure. I’ll never forget being alone in the recording booth with him filming him as he lit the mic on fire 🔥
It's sick that webby got this collab great video

WEBBY <3 🔥🔥🔥
Rip DMX  RR for life
@Chris Webby Who you down with What set you reppinw
Love it, but need to do less work with others, they bring your skill down, I prefer any of your solo songs over any of your colabs
rip dmx
People don't realize how much of a underground legend Webby has been for the last 14 years.   He's only just recently started gaining real traction and getting bigger. Half way to a million homie!
Crazy the last feature he did was with Webby?  Glad you were to get him on a song before his death!
Real recognize real I'm glad CW got a blessing from DmX
Wish DMX was shown more throughout his verse. RIP god
This is what they call -- UNTOUCHABLE!! FIRE!!
Wicked video even better song! 👌🏻💎🙌🏻 Much Love from 🇨🇦
🤜😈🤛
Honestly gave me goosebumps, UNLIKE the new song GOSPEL
Damn miss X the man was the truth and the real. R.I.P. Earl see you on the other side brotha.
💖💖🔥🔥
Dmx!!!
✝️🛡️😇🙏💚
My man 💪 The respect you have for Goats, and the Fire spit track to track makes you a legend.
Didn't he get the jab before he died ?
rest in peace the dog king dmx
Only good part starts at 1:44
Are you afraid to die?   Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
Bro thank you for this mf 🔥 absolutely blessed to hear the dog again 💪💪💪
This joint is straight 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Cool song, but Chris Webby is not tough. Him trying to represent that he is is an absolute joke. the kid is like 130 lbs. You might have some homies on the payroll, but that still won't make you tough. Stick with the lyrics and poetics, my ivory brother.
Webby paying homage to DMX and including RR why he did is phenomenal
that shit was so fucking Fire!! mad respect
💯🖤
Even in death you can stop the Dog
X's last video needs to be heard (& more importantly - *LISTENED TO*) by all people far & wide...  Before it's too late
This song deserves to climb that trending chart!
🔥🔥🔥
Holy ❤  Shit 😡
This beat is godly and webby new exactly what flows to use💯🔥
Damn he went in
I had the honor of shaking X's hand. One of the coolest moments of my life .
🔥 bro!!! Rip X!!
Webb ripping the rim off the backboard yet again
Rip dmx. A true legend taken before his time.  Webby doing the 203 and 860 proud.
RIP DMX..
Okay!!!! FIRE 🔥 COME WIT IT
Trending again
RIP DMX
Just here to be a part of history
X forever this is beyond dope
Even in death X  is still killin it!!! Chris Webby is a beast too though.  People talk about how Em is the goat to which I agree, but Webby could possibly be that white boy that Em pass the torch to.
Instant classic
Webby doesnt miss.. end of discussion. Rip DMX
Dmx is the shit and webby killed it 100 best song out so far
😆😁💓💓💓
Rip X
Can’t stop playing this!!!! No words can describe how dope this is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This kinda hard
Mad respect ✊
Straight Flames!
We git it on when the bomb is ticking!!! Love the RR
Sad cus that's the best verse I heard from x in years
Love the song, love the video, and I absolutely Love Webby
Knew webby would blow up Since La La La , CT peeps are a new breed
Webby dropping this banger! Thank you! Long live the dog!!
Whoop whoop! Love this song brother! Webby and DMX (RIP) bringing that fire 🔥
How did Webby get a DMX verse? The new, lost, acid burnt Webby putting out a track with a verse from the late great DMX is disrespectful. Not surprised though. Webby turned trash. Love some X though.
🔥 🔥
Hell yeah dmx
X ✊🙏
Daaamn yooo that track is straight 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 ,u can feel X for reaaal like he was never gone !R.I.P X the whole world miss u!
🔥🎙🔥
Fire ass song love it 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love the video! I'm originally from CT and I recognized this right away. Very cool seeing something I know in a video 😃
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥I’d say this has got to be one of the hardest songs Web has ever put out, and that’s saying a lot because all his music is 🔥. He’s his own competition. 💪🏼
🔥
Rip the goat, banger track!
It was pleasure being in the video, Thanks Again #Webby
Webby stays killing it!! DMX made it that much better! R.I. P
RIP DMX -as a recovering addict myself… I’ll never forget how lucky I am to have survived, in part because I refuse to forget all the GOATS we’ve lost, just in my 40 year life!  Another #Webby for my playlist ❤️‍🔥🤩thanks Chris & very nice video tribute
sigh.. I miss being driven around
Fantastic work on this
I’m here n I’m superhuman

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is awesome and the homage was amazing.  DMX's music helped a lot in my teen years getting through things from bullying to the positives of wrestling to knowing he had anxiety problems just like me and was able to still perform.  Still sad he is gone.
Instant classic
"Featuring DMX audio track"  think that's what you meant.
Sweet track! That CGI looks like shit tho lol
Love the dmx dog graphic

Rest in Paradise DMX!! His talent has still been unmatched!! This song is 🔥

Was on a Hopsin binge today and something inside me told me to check up on webby. After hearing this masterpiece I'm convinced I have a sixth sense.
Webby spitting like dmx reincarnated

We up tends to mean to me about getting up and dusting our feet emotionally, mentally and spiritually, from bad times and hard life changing moments.

I liked it until I saw the dogs with clipped ears and now I cannot enjoy this song….. webby you are great and I like what you have to say but I don’t like the animal abuse mate, I’m not saying you endorse but I don’t like it is all. I obviously will keep watching liking and listening but this one missed for me mate. All the best see you next Wednesday if not before
That boom bap always hits right
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Haha when are these rappers gonna tell the truth ! Liar 🤥
Love Webby,  love D, but not loving this. D as a CGI talking dog?   Scooby-Dooby Doo!

Bro this is so hard, fuckin love it man!  You def became one of my fav artists real quick, but this one is on another level with X on here. RIP to the legend.  Respect and love brother!
Always here for it. 👌🔊🔊🎧💯📝

When you gonna rap about conspiracy theories again for more views bro? You just a bog standard rapper bro. Shame on you
Hellz Yeah! #URW
Banger 💪🏻
Fucking fire
I gotta say, shout out to the Ruff Ryders for showing up for this.💯  That was very touching. RIP to X.
When the dog started rapping
I think my thoughts then Chris webby says them. Keep blowing up it literally makes my heart feel like it's gonna explode
This shit dope dope
Much love for this one. Miss DMX man tragic what happened.
this shit hard damn
A video DMX would be proud of. Killer project!
Sounds like Eminem's Lose Yourself interpolated with a new beat on it. It's that Em delivery style and that guitar riff going over and over again along with the slapstick style lyrics. Not saying it's bad and it's probably obvious. Glad to see Webby coming in heavier with music drops on YouTube recently. Probably more successful than he's ever been right now and seems like he's finally getting more push. First time I ever saw Webby was that freestyle video years ago where he was sitting on the couch and accidentally kicked the aux out but came back on as he plugged it back in without missing the beat. Really one of the most iconic freestyle videos on YouTube amongst a small handful. RIP DMX.
🔥🔥🔥
Hell to the fricken yeah
Rule #1 don't fuq with the Ruff Ryders
Never put somebody's kids in it.. coward shit bro
Webby and DMX!?  Wow, who woulda known..  This beat is bananas, fire all around 🔥 🔥
Christian Webster this ish is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 RIP to the the dog of all dogs. We miss you
Hey webby when are we gonna get another raw thoughts  🔥🔥🔥

When I'm 85, sitting in the rocking chair on the porch &  yelling at the neighborhood kids to, Get of my lawn!",       I will be playing DMX & telling them how this is real music, not  that crap you kids are listening to today.       If, at 85, I'm in a nursing home, YES, my neighbors will  be getting noise complaints, daily but I'm not going to give a damn because  I'm 85 muta-FKR. Doe something son.!!
A fine tribute to a legend. Webby is on fire lately.

Did he really die from the “jab”????
Show me who run with and I’ll show u who u are. Pretty clear.
There's 1 rapper that gives me goosebumps. His name is Chris webby
Proverbs 4:14-22 Do not enter the path of the wicked, And do not walk in the way of evil. Avoid it; do not travel on it, Turn away from it and pass on. For they do not sleep unless they have done evil, And their sleep is taken away unless they make someone fall. For they eat the bread of wickedness, And drink the wine of violence. But the path of the just is like the shining sun, That shines ever brighter unto the perfect day. The way of the wicked is like darkness; They do not know what makes them stumble. My son, give attention to my words; Incline your ear to my sayings. Do not let them depart from your eyes; Keep them in the midst of your heart; For they are life to those who find them, And health to all their flesh.
Miss u x and the old school rap like trick daddy And do or die 80 s and 90 early 2000,the last of Dime bred
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Webby never fades. Thank you X for your masterpieces to Hip-Hop. R.I.P. King 🙏🏿
His name is speed
Yo webby.... theres this kid hes 19 he barks on his is music and he claims no other rappers has ever done it b4. I already commented on his last music video and said hes disrespectig dmx and and I'm highly upset for what he said to souljia boy in aiden rosses live stream a while back which was" you'll be the first rapper to bark on a track" speed said to souljia boy. I was a big fan of x my self and this speed kid idk and hes says speed gang to alot which is also a name of another music artist lol... I hate seeing fake out there these messed up kids bro tf?????

Is there anything  this man can't  do?
Were you two supposed to make a collab before he died and this is the result? The track is sick. The lyrics, flows, beat and dark man x raw voice and delivery.
I wanna see a WWE style feud between Webby and Tom MacDonald...diss tracks for miles... That would be sick.
Made my night giving me a new x verse
RIP to the legend DMX. This one right here is definitely in the top of your best music 🔥
this music video is so corny...you went down the street in a BS range rover with 2 dudes on dirtbikes flying down some lame city side roads. What is this, the new Backstreet Boys???
I'm starting to think there may be a lot more people alive that the public believes is dead. Idk... just been on my mind a lot lately.
where was this video shot webby?
