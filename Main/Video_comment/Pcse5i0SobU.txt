Flashing a 5.10c at first climbing? Wow
Anyone know what gym this is
That's a 5.10c?? the holds are too good to be a 5.10c, maybe the spacing?
18:40 is he belaying correctly?
Wow. Seriously so impressive. I don't think I climbed this well after 6 months of climbing every week. Huge props.
This was fun. But for all you amateur-psychologists out there, if you wanna see what a person lying looks like, 1:18 🤣
Zach is that annoying kid in class that says he failed the test. But actually got an A.
whats the grade of black tag yellow boulder that magnus did?
You can def tell he has the strength for it. Theres just a mental block
5.10c on day 1 is pretty impressive.  I remember my first day I barely got through a 5.10a, and it wasn't a flash
How did he not fly up to the top 🥀
This dude is no beginner xD
zach king literally sounds and almost looks like alex honnold lmao i couldnt stop thinking about alex this whole video
For a beginner, that 17:56 drop knee into rock over was craaazy
okay stronghold, who belay tested magnus? lol
7:28 the lil boy behindyou
since i started to climbing its now 3weeks and im already v7 and thats because i watch youre videos really every day you pushing my motivation to the max pls never stop doing videos  i think im not allone if i say you are a role model for me
It’s a beautiful thing to see 2 masters of different passions discuss their crafts
zach king is kinda like me, always swears he can't do it and then proceeds to do it
10:25 laws of attraction and what you spend your energy on (both physically and mentally) truly is a powerful means of success 💯❤️
I was struggling to do a backflip. Dreamed about doing one perfectly and was able to backflip the next day.
that was fun but who is zach king exactly ?
Shoutout to runners
Watching Magnus makes me want to do this so bad but I know I really can't because I have so much weight to lose before I can even try
Wow this vid led me to look up Zach king! He’s doing cool videos indeed. But I love your climbing videos.
“Let’s go how do you get down” famous words
For those who think it’s impossible to do a V5 first session:  1. The boulder he did was probably more a V3-4 non techy, not a v5  2. Some people just understand how to move their bodies better. I took a friend to go climbing for the first time ever and he used a wonderful heel hook where most beginners would just freeze and fall. My friend was just a natural. I myself started climbing in the V3-4 range on my first day and got to v7 within 3 months.  3. People have other sports that may prepare them for bouldering without knowing. I for example already could cross a 100 foot slack line, could climb palm trees and spent all my life climbing up and down piers and other things, all activities that have similar movements to bouldering. So it’s likely that Zach does some kind of activity that inadvertently prepared him for climbing.   4. He’s wearing those trash rental shoes. That actually makes what he did harder, but leads me to believe he actually wasn’t pretending.
Magnus, its amazing to see what you've accomplished over the last 5 years by bringing climbing awareness and functional videos to to the masses. By including " Non-climbers", noteworthy fitness legends and power lifters, as well as the average climber trying to improve, you've achieved a great reach in the world and helped more people start and continued their climbing journeys. I really never thought a decade ago that a climber would have a wonderful channel like this with almost 3 millions Subs! Maybe not 100M views yet but honestly, the reach you've had and have are making a positive impact. Cheers
As a beginner I'm really curious about what did you teach him? He did everything naturally. I remember my first session and all colors were allowed from right to left and I could manage but then my forearms were out of order for 5 days.  Sorry, but the caption of the video is a scam for real beginners!
Wait, does Zach even use any chalk this whole session?
Damn this guy really is impressive for his first day.
At his first ever climbing session, he climbed a 6b onsight? I want to train with you Magnus, maybe I will on-sight a 7a (which I have never ever tried) :D
that kid in the background 😂
10:17 Nice introspection
Can anyone explain Bernies defense on not accepting healthcare exuc. donations. I had never heard him accused of this before.
shoutout stronghold LA
magnus i LOVE what you said about how you are training even when you aren't climbing, just practicing moves in your head and THINKING about climbing, i thought i was weird for that!! haha
Definitely not v5. Maybe a very soft V2
Well he almost looks like Alex Honnold so no wonder he's a natural
I was amazing to watch
It’s always a bit confusing when there’s a lot of grading systems, I’m just used to Scandinavian and always have to translate it
That one kid in the blue!😂
This was actually great :D ! loved the energy between you two
Magdust really is magnificent !
OMG hes climbing V6-7 on his FIRST TIME!?!? WHAT!? Ive been limbing for a year and a half and im still bareley doing v5s like what!?
I just climbed for my first time today and managed to complete a V4!! I trained calisthenics for about 15 months and I think the finger strength training carried over quite well.
in my first session i did 6a+ and now im loving bouldering just bought shoes my current best is 6b+ in my 4th session
10:47
i gpo to that rock climb gym all the time
A 5.10c for first top rope is crazy.. Ive just completed my first v3 and 5.10a
There's no way he hasn't climbed before... just in college once doesn't count. He was gripping advanced holds with ease, like he clearly knew how to hold them ahead of time.
to a v5 in ONE session????
Measuring time in Vines is so funny lol
My home gym!!!
19:29 like a ballsack
7:28 the kid in the background lol
This dude for sure climbed before this lol
one of these beginners needs to trick magnus and start climbing V9 on their first day lol
i think i know the ending .. maaagic *-.-*-.-*
Lol can you teach me how to go from V4 to V7 in one session too?
You should do this video again but with a group of random fans.
I am 68 and want to try this. I think I am athletic and strong enough. Looks so cool !!!
Am i mixing something up? Those 5.10s looks like maybe a 5a (5.7) in my gym. All those holds look like jugs, especially on the white route ...
10:40: I play piano and chess, and your subconscious thoughts do play I big role in your improvement on the skill, I absolutely agree!!
You shouldn't put so much focus on flashing or you'll avoid hard things.
two of my favorite youtubers
Not only are you a master of climbing, but also grace. Truly a paragon.
Is he referring at 9:00 to how climbers try to work out the boulder problem before they start? It reminded me of how olympic climbers get their first look at the problem
I would love to see you teaching climbing to someone "normal" with NO strength, maybe even a bit overweight, so that they cannot compensate with pure strength but HAVE to use technique to go on! ❤ (But maybe that wouldn't make an interesting video cause it would take too many sessions....?)
Dudes gonna make Zach the most followed climber in the world😂😂
Glad to see Magnus helping smaller creators in collabs
Dang, I’ve been climbing for months and I just sent my first V5 😂
His body language says he’s 100% lying about never climbing before…
I feel his anxiety and mine pumping LOL @19:00
"I'll try a black one while you rest"  This is not magnus being kind and considerate, that is magnus itching to climb himself 🤣
Gotta love that kid coughing into his hand, then grapping on to the holds.. disgusting! Bad manners!
13:30  Zach: What's my other foot? Magnus: you don't have any other feet. 🤣
this was the bets video i have seen in a while like the best.
5.10c? Those looked like 5.8-5.9...maybe my gym is messed.
I call bs. No one that is a “first time” comber knows the terminology and slang words.
those 2 6bs were like 5a in my gym. one of our 6as has extremely small crimps (nothing else, just that) and you have to use the side of the wall (it curves too).
I don’t believe a word zach says
Looks like intermedia pretty sure he climbed before.
Youre a great coach magnus
the way he handles his fear and speaks about it reminds me a ton of alex honnold
I really do think that because of saying Zach is a natural he became that more. If you wouldn’t have told him that it maybe wouldn’t have happened. Try this with someone who isn’t just unsure and I think it would work as well
every video that I watch makes me want to do climbing, but i dont have anyone to climb with and im kinda scared of heightssssssss
21:00 im sorry i dont want to be that guy but like thats the easiest 6b i have ever seen
I love that trick at the beginning😆
In order to be great at something I truly believe you have to love failing at it.  Even in this video magnus said “that’s the fun part” when talking to Zac about trying over and over again on climbs he doesn’t know how to do yet.  I’ve never thought about it this way before but I think it’s super cool
The dreaming part is actually so fucking true. I dreamt about doing a back walkover and then I did it for the first time the next day. Wild how to mind works
Zach's asking really smart questions. My friend took me climbing for the first time a month ago and I'm hooked, but damn some of the things Zach's asking no one's ever really told me and I didn't realize to ask 😄 very helpful
Ceazy
★WELL DONE EPISODE SIR🙌🏽👍🏽🙌🏽🤟🏽THANK YOU FOR THIS EPISODE SIR MAGNUS AND SIR ZACH🙌🏽🙏🏼🙌🏽👏🏼★
9:19 Holy molly what is happening right now?! 😂
No way that yellow boulder was a 7a+
bro. i was at this climbing gym around the same time I'm so mad i missed this
Ya Zach, I learned lead climbing later in the career 😂
Hey that’s Stronghold climbing gym in LA! Love that place. There’s a nice brewery with good beer and food right next door 👍🏾
Definitely has a climbed a good bit before.
No shot he hasn't climbed before 🤯🤯
I love your philosophy of success at 10:25… what you focus on you connect with.
I don’t even think I could do the last one and I’ve already done 2 sessions!
V5 in the first session???? What
This was cool and motivating!
Just realized the is the bouldering gym I just went to today lmao
I hate going to the gym. Went to a rock climbing facility two days ago and fell in love. Got a membership and will be using rock climbing as my main exercise now.
I've just started bouldering. I'm day 2. Seeing Zach do the climb at 15:05 was inspirational. I wouldn't have even thought to do something like that yesterday. Maybe I'll give some harder grades a go today.
where's this climbing gym?
i get it now zach makes it look like magnus can climb
I'm a member at this gym and just now discovered this video lol. Stronghold is an incredible gym!
getting sore with me ? 1 like here will equal 1 push up with video 😅 ( I am beginner )
Two super ADHD people who are great at their interest meeting :D
He is a serious natural! My first time I would not have gotten to the top that easily let alone be next to an edge and over hang lol
This was great to watch. You're a great instructor Magnus!
I used to be obsessed with Zach's videos, and recently I've wanted to get into climbing. So when I saw his name I was like huh, that's cool. This is a great video for me too, he asks so many great questions that answer a lot of mine. A great watch for someone like me.
He's such a chiller
Love how Magnus spotted some talent and turned on real coaching mode Zach did say he bouldered once in college but it looks like it was a lot more than once based on how he was moving on the wall. Onsighting a 5.10c with that much speed and flow is basically impossible without at least half a dozen sessions under your belt
23 € for a chalk is to expensive for me
Cut both my arms if this guy never climbed before.
Teach it to Make shake 🤝
Very kind of Magnus to help out smaller youtubers like Zack 😂
there is no way a guy that hasnt climbed to on sight a 6C
⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️
Bro was in a manga chapter from baki
Me and my friends are all track and field athletes and went to a climbing gym for the first time during fall break and were able to make it to a V4, I️ assumed that was normal, what is the average person’s experience?
I start a mount ago and still can't do v6 i'm only at v5
man, i have not seen this guy in like 10 years, i didnt even know he still made videos!  he looked so natural climbing, i bet on his way home he went to get some of those "sticky shoes"! :D
Magnus you're not using PBUS
0:46 caption says 'suck king '
You are both so amazing. Magnus, you inspired me to start climbing. So now, for the first time in my life, I'm training and smiling.
Did he just climb 7 UIAA while being first time in climbing gym? wtf.. :D
As it turns out, being afraid of heights gives you motivation to climb all the way!
As a commercial pilot, I’m still scared of heights, just completely unrelated.
took me two years for that whatttt
1 month and we still haven't hit half a mil views?! Come on people watch more!
i swear this man is a human monkey, he makes it look so easy
OMG i used to climb there stronghold climbing gym right?
Great coloab! You are magic both! ☺
A lot of people are mentioning the size of the holds of the 5.10c, but I haven't seen anyone comment on the angle of the wall itself. The camera angles give the impression that this wall is entirely vertical, but if you look how the ropes fall fairly far from the wall, you'll notice that the entire wall is on an overhang. This likely accounts for a lot of the grading, even if it might still be a bit soft.
40 seconds in and Zack has already done his magic
Me over here still giving up on v2's got me like what is Zach's secret lol
Who the hell is that guy a famous youtuber, but i've never seen him before. He is very flexible built, no rigidity so often seen from gym weight lifter, that is why he is a natural.  That excepted he was boring to watch, i felt like i wouldn't have watched this.
Those 5.10Cs look easier than the 5.4s at my local climbing gym
idk y but seeing zach briefly reminded me of alex honald. anyone else see the similarity
I was climbing v5's first time i went.
i love chalk.
so genuine advice wanted here. turning 30 this year and never climbed before but would like to,   is it a bad idea for me?  In the last couple years I've broken my index finger and dislocated my thumb, (mostly healed) In the last 5 years both my wrists have suffered (enflamed pisiform area, currently healed) And I have had permanent toe pain in one foot (unable to stand on the toes only on left foot)  Toe thing is probably workaroundable, (like I can still sprint if I adjust my balance) but I am pretty concerned about how my hands like breaking every few years.
Zach saying a banger is a million LIKES in the first 24 hours is crazy. He's amazing, but not that amazing.
9:10 Magnus not knowing warmups doesn‘t surprise me😂😂😂
I'm project v7 after 11 months so to hear magnus say 3-4 years is nice
The thing Zach was showing climbers do with hands - is how at comps they visualize the route before they start climbing, quickly going through all the hand motions left-right-left-right...
I loooooved this collab
I ordered the Magdust 6-pack. I was hesitant because Norway is not in the EU, but Rungne does the tax and import for you.
Not to be that guy, but - the rating on that 6b seems uber soft? Zach was literally able to jam his whole arm behind some holds.  Not to take anything away from his achievement tho, that is some crazy talent
Magnus, youre a great coach man. I enjoy your content, i wanna try wall climbing coz of you and. I think were the same height too haha
Beginner my ass
wow Zach was hella impressive!
420k views, HEHE :D  +rly good vid Magnus <3
I've been watching Magnus for a couple months and today I just went to the climbing gym for the first time in my life. I feel like I was WAY better at it because of watching these videos. It was really fun
6:22 no for real how do you get down guys?
PLEASE make magdust in chalk balls - my gym doesn’t allow loose chalk!
Can you invite most famous norwegian streamer Wirtual to a bouldering vid? He´s also bouldering :)
3:22
5.10c / 6b for this series of beige jugs? :D Are you kidding?  I think that's easy to say "V0 to V5" if a V5 at that place is worth a V3 anywhere else... ;)
Magnus, I love your climbing videos. They are my favorite. I see the trend on your channel right now: non climbing videos getting more views, but I would love it if you still continued to make climbing videos, even if they’re less frequent (I still enjoy your others too). Thanks brother! Stay safe 🙏
Wow i never saw anyone climbing onsight a 6b on their first time at the gym. Impressive !
So a black is green..? 😂
Dang zach is killing it!!!

Recap by Tammy AI
Magnus you inspire me to make sure I am working on boulders I can't do right away.
He has such an intelligent demeanor
WOW, 6B as a beginner, thats amazing, you should climb :)
Magicians exist
The way he immediately pulls down on the rope for slack at 19:22 is VERRRRRY sus
Teach me next
he's a natural, and yeah, very observant indeed, so he'd do fine solving the problems
I've been climbing for several years now. This guy if he continues to climb could be a very good climber
Both Zach and Magnus make me think the same thing “what the heck”
Damn !!! Zach is so strong wtf, flashing a 5.10c when he came climbing for the first time, super impressive !
Love your vids Magnus! ❤
Hey Magnus, would you ever do a collab video with the Storror lads? That would make for a very FUN video.
I don't know why but these videos have such a weird calmness. I feel relaxed watching this + Magnus is a really humble and down to earth guy teaching another really cool guy how to climb :D
When will you do a colab with Mike Boyd?
Ngl, your belaying technique makes me nervous but then remembering that Magnus Mitdbo could probably just throttle the rope with his bare hands makes me feel better again
beginner my ass
I just dont understand how the ladder at 18:14 is a 6b?
The bouldering was impressive, but flashing two 6bs on toprope in a first session is incredible.
Using one hand to type this, please help, my left hand completely stuck to a hold due to use of Mag Dust.
@7:28 hello kid.
Shout out to Magnus for helping spread our religion (climbing, lol)
Not to mention but.. He looks very smart. I mean, asking a lot of question and also quick mind to think about thing... Nice collab and video, well done ! (both of you :) )
I really miss the outdoor climbing videos :(
Hate to be that guy but is the white route he's doing at the end really 6B / 5.10c ? Zach's very good for a beginner, but that route looked very easy for the grade.  Nice video though.
Can you do more leadclimbing video’s? I miss those.
“V5”
my friend was there when you filmed! i was counting the days till you uploaded
Rungne acquired. I could go for a little bit deeper pockets. I feel like my phone will fall out walking or sitting
Weird to see that there's a lot of people that don't know you can improve on something simply by thinking about it and imagining it. There's been studies showing a 30%+ improvement over a month by only doing the activity in your mind(Obviously a simpler task and not a general one like climbing is) But still, your mind is so powerful and a lot of people don´t even realize
Magnus what happened to your girlfriend?
Shadow support comment
@zachking *it's called a fear of falling.* it's not a true fear of heights because that gets you even on planes and stuff. fear of falling is HEIGHTS but where falling is a possibility. could be ladders, lighthouses or other things where the railing doesn't seem high enough to prevent being knocked/blown/tripped over, glass bridges/walkways (for some people).  i have this, too.  i also am working on it and rock climbing is something i'm trying to build up to and was going to start with bouldering. (jumping down from the boulder wall i know will be tough for me though...)
Hi Magnus ild love to purchase your chalk but living in the UK its not easy, the website Rungne doesn't seem to work for me, any chance your chalk will be sold on Amazon maybe or some other site available in the UK?
i love zach and you!!! im so happy yall are collabing 😁😁😁😁  p.s. youre a bad influence 😂 my climbing mate hates warming up. i wonder where he got that from 😂
Plot twist. Zach couldn't climb past v0 but he edited the entire video 😂
I really miss videos with just you and Mary’s at the gym in Norway
We need to set up a rehab for chalk abusers (aka climber cocaine) before Magnus ODs and someone finds him face down in a chalk bag 😅
hey magnus you should do a video with browny i feel like it might be a fun Collab
Can you do a collab with @BrowneyShorts
He's climbed before and the lying is cringe.
Magnus fell off a v7? Wut?....
A truly amazing climber and I watch your vids when there uploaded straight away! But daaaaaaamn your shop is expensive😳.... Was only looking to get some chalk as I really want to try it but I'm alright with basic stuff I guess haha
He has arms and hands like a climber
At 9:00, I think Zach might be talking about visualizing.
E
I have been watching your videos for years even though I didn't boulder back then. You have inspired me and I finally started climbing a couple months ago and I'm really addicted to it now. Keep up the good work!
That’s my gym! I love stronghold!
Two of the most inspiring people out there!
Magnus, You should try to Collab with Markiplier I thinks its something that viewers would really like to see and would be fun for both of you.
You should make a tube with @MovementByDavid :)
Please magnus try the b-pump gym in japan. I am sure everyone would love to see how you doing there!
Great video and colab, always entertaining to watch!
I love watching people with no real, climbing, frame of reference, when they climb with magnus. They are completely amazed by him, and if they were just a little bit better they would be even more in awe of him.
Seems like Magnus was being pranked by Zach that he doesnt know how to climb :D :D :D
Stronghold! The best gym!
Tried a climbing gym for the first time this weekend, would be amazing to have someone to help with what the route is up the wall. After having watched your videos for a while I could often find the path for my hands but don't have the strength to push through without legs, and I had no idea where those were going on many of the routes we tried. Unfortunately it was 2 beginners no one in my friend group that climbs to help us out.
Magnus brings in Olympic gymnasts, and this humble guy who does video editing tricks is doing better than any of them.  I hope he keeps climbing after making this video.
Fun video but why climb with a hat tho😅
i wanna see more of Zach, seriously. This is friggin amazing what mr Zach did here in my opinion.
long time since i've seen Magnus drooling that much for someone hahah
wheres the v5? can someone time stamp it
More climbing please Magnus!! I love watching you solve problems, please don’t edit out your climbs (or parts of your climbs)
5.10C for the first time rock climbing?? Wow
It almost looked like Zack was Björn from Magnus videos but prank was made on Magnus himself
Are we sure this guy wasn’t one of Magnus’ stunts where he pretends to be a beginner 😂
"So he will try climbing without any magic" Yeah right
I've been climbing for two years now, and with my wife we opened our own small climbing gym and I think partly we should blame Magnus for this 😁
This was awesome! Can't believe Zach has never climbed before?!
Impressed👍Low percentile of people can do what he just did first time👏
The white one which was a 5.10c looked like a 5.9 in my climbing gym 😂
Stop calling jug ladders V5s. I’m all for beginners enjoying themselves - but in the gyms here in London <10% of people can climb v5. It takes people months and years to get that good, and it makes a mockery of them to say that you’ve done it in one go.
Congratulations on your duet with ZachKing, which is simply incredible. Me and my friends have been following you for three years now, and you've inspired us all! We started climbing thanks to you, we've just created a channel thanks to you. Thanks for the videos and thanks for everything. You really are too good!!!
this guy could be a VERY good climber...
wow, Ellen? really? low.
The thing I never realized until my first time climbing is how much time is spent resting
I love that u Colab with so many diffident kind of content creators❤
this was WILD,  I don't think Zach realizes how good for a beginner he is!
Maybe he is avenging all the coaches you cheated 😂 That climb at collage? Was it really just once?
so there was a video with a fpv drone year ago. What if you tried to climb smth while looking trough drones eyes at yourself from 3rd person? would've been a cool video
Great Video Magnus!👍 Greetings from the swiss alps.
The villas are getting better and better! Now get Kelly wakasa out climbing 😂
If I was 5,9 I would climb more
bro flashing 6b on toprope on his first climb
Magnus, im blown away by the skills. Youve inspired my son and i to try out climbing. We are off to edinburgh international climbing centre to test our skills. Whats your beat advice for grip strength training ?
am i the only person who realized he is climbing top rope with no chalk... magnus...wha...
the place looks great.
this is amazing love seeing magnus collab with these ppl
You know you should try a video where you teach some old Asian massage therapist to climb. The kind that has the crazy grip strength that kills you. I bet they could be great climbers
Hey dude . Don’t go extreme where dying is probable . Live your life . I would be stoked if I met you at Venice HB or Newport
Man, the way Magnus immediately gauged his skill was crazy! When he suggested the top rope, I was like “yeah what is Magnus thinking, no way he can take a 5.10c.” But Zach crushed it easily. What a beast!
wow
I bet he could've climbed at least V7 if he'd taken his shirt off! 😄
10:00 This is how we all feel when he says stuff like this lol
why does Zach still look like a teenager
Being a climber and also a beginner vfx artist, seeing my two fav youtubers doing this surprise collab just blows my mind!!! Loved the short basic vfx trick at the start, and also Zach should defo keep on climbing from now on!!!!
So I saw in a game a climber falling and catches herself on another climber. Then climbs the climber. Back up to the wall. Kinda wonder if u could see or try to catch a faling climber with one hand or leg. Or replicate some movies. See if it's possible.
The fact that this guy has the forearm endurance to flash a 10.c on his first day is unbelievable, by which I mean I don’t believe it’s his first time climbing
Thank you for climbing with us Magnus and Zach.  To anyone wondering about the gym, we are located in Los Angeles.  We hope that some of the people who watch this video will be inspired to try climbing, maybe even with us!
When you hit 2m you should do another climb every boulder video again.
That felt too short
And im kinda short 145-150cm😅
I tried Boulder climbing for the first time and i was able to do v4-5 and im 12 it it took me 29 mins to do it😅
Zack was very impressive with his natural climbing, Magnus you should do a climbing video with Jesse James i think you guys could get along together well. All love from Egypt
Never trust a magician... lol
so jealous, it's taken me a year to get to where he is
Looks like his hamstrings are almost as tight as mine. I feel if you're about 6 foot/180 cm or above, you usually have really tight hamstrings by default. Looked like Zach will have a sturdy core, but the L sit would probably take months to years to really get, he's actually fighting his own hamstrings.   The other reason I think like Zach's hammy's are tight (I'm sure his downward dog looks as bad as mine) is he mentioned running. Running really keeps your hamstrings tight, especially for taller people.   I've had a much easier time increasing my hip flexibility for climbing and injury avoidance. Hamstrings are such a big muscle group, takes a lot longer to stretch them because taller people are showing that square cube law. Like I might be only 8-10 inches taller than some of my exes in fitness, but I could have 100lbs muscle on them too.
I did my first day of climbing today (motivated by your videos) and couldn't even get past a V2. 😂 10/10 would try again! Keep up the awesome climbing content!
The bangers are great!!$$$$$$You did great congratulations
7:30 kid waved at the camera.
Seeing Magnus bouldering with Pewdiepie would be crazy
You guys talking about how you think about the hows and mechanics of climbing and editing just... All the time is SO familiar to me, but I do it with writing 8D I think any expert at their craft, that's as important as the 10k hours. You don't just practice when you're practicing, but All The Time. I'm writing while I fic breakfast, you're climbing while you brush your teeth. Not physically, but mentally. You train yourself to think about it from all sorts of angles and perspectives. What if this problem has been different in this way, could I use the same techniques? What would change.
i honestly use a difrent chulk but its about to run out so ama check ur chulk out
Magnus, your passion and love for climbing is infectious! Thx for teaching me, an absolute honor!
Those boulders look a lot easier than the 6a's in the netherlands thats for sure! Good climbs! Looking forward to my visit to the usa in a bit so i can try for myself ;)
Zach King is very strong
the last route he did made me think of the time magnus pretended to be an icelandic tv reporter climbing for the first time.
hey man been a long time, missed you.
Hey Magnus, I wanted to thank you for all of your videos. Ive struggled with chronic pain for the past decade. And  it took me years to start moving again.  But I build it up slowly with walking 20 mins everyday untill I could do more. And also 5 push ups everyother day and build that up overtime.   3 months ago I finally felt strong enough to start climbing myself! In that time I started really slow by climbing only once a week, doing easy routes and resting alot. But by doing so consitently ive now been able to climb a few 6b routes and even a 6c route!  Im extremely excited to keep improving and see where I can go!  So thank you for the extra motivation I got thanks to your videos, it has been very helpful and fun! <3
By the end I was half expecting Zach to wipe away his makeup and explain that he’s been Magnus all along.
no WAY that was his first time!! Insane
I think he's confusing that exercise...with dry running the route with hands.
Plot twist: Zach actually hired an experienced climber to take his place that day, and disguised him in makeup to look like himself.
When are we going to have climbing pants for women on Rungne 🤩
Toby segar collab??? 👀
The view from setting the camera at the top of the wall was AMAZING. You guys should totally do it again!!!😃
Zach did so well!
He was so natural
Loved it when he got that blue, so good for the first time
First top rope route was not a 6b. Probably not even a 5a...
Zach is such a natural! And Magnus is the best coach, great video thanks ❤
6b, first time?😮
Awsome video. I should start climbing in the US though, those 6bs looked surprisingly easy
Damn 22 minutes felt like 10
I am sorry, Magnus, but you are disappoint me with switching lower hands while belaying. I did not expect that from you. Am I the only one, who noticed that ? I am pretty sure that technique is not recommended and is often used by beginers. Am I wrong ?
An absolute natural!  Can't believe it's his first climb, wow.
v3+ flash on ur first day is crazy
Wow. I'm jealous. hahah. Zack has such confidence on the wall. I think that helped a lot.
I think it's a little bit silly Why would you be afraid of climbing a wall If you're not afraid of jumping off a wall or voice versa
Good to see you back in the gym!   Hopefully we'll see some more soon!
More climbing videos is an auto watch. Thank you Magnus!
This seems so much like the videos where magnus is pretending to be a beginner haha
Magnus you are my biggest crush ever. My favorite content of yours is you just climbing hard in the gym! And i don’t mean hard hard. Just like 7a and over. I completely eat that shit up! I would totally just watch 1h of you just climbing shirtless and squeezing those lats x)   plz more of just you climbing! But fuck me! Please just do what you want and what makes you happy!
The routesetting in this gym looks kinda weird
Magnus please go to Slovenian climbing center. Climbing ranch ❤
In the first top rope route are those Escape Climbing Holds?
Larry Hil. Zach king. Chris Heria. Eddie Hall.
Nobody cares, but after 20 years of no climbing I flashed a 6b. Magnus you're my new favourite youtuber!
Look at his wingspan and height advantage. Zach would be the Alex Honnold of YouTubers
What a collab !!! damn !!!
Zach crushed it!! I've been watching his edits for probably over a decade now... He's an OG for sure. Floating up two 10c's and flashing a V3 is insane!  Magnus please teach your guests proper downclimbing and how to fall/roll... It's so scary watching beginners (especially those bigger dudes) having zero idea what to do once they're at the top of the wall. Otherwise love you. ♥
20:07 just lol. Especially magnus reaction.
Magnus, nice haircut!
V5 in first session? what gym is he in? i wanna be there. he could get good at climbing fast.
Zach giving off "Bjorn from Iceland" vibes!
Pro Climber pretends to be Youtuber and flashes all the routes 😅
Guy isn't new to climbing...how quickly he asked "do you wanna go do some top-rope" leads one to obviously assume that he's been in that world before.
I seriously thought the end of this video was going to be Zach saying: JK I’ve actually been climbing every day for a year.  So cool to see him get started with climbing!
Zach scared of height is a classic example of not begin scared of begin high up but sacred of falling down from high up
Ha it's kind of like Magnus is starting a "Hot Ones" style interview series where he meets random other youtubers and interviews them while teaching them to climb. I'm here for it!
top notch video as always
Så snilt av deg å ta med litt mindre kjente youtubere på kanalen Magnus.😂 Elsker videoene dine og spesielt disse, forsett å gjør oss nordmenn stolte❤
YouTube is such an insane place, I’m watching daily yet never heard of this guy or seen any of his videos 😅 I follow a lot of magicians too 🤷‍♀️ thanks for the video! Love the collabs and meeting so many YouTubers I’d never see!
22:00 Magnus’s bs detector going off and Zach immediately uses misdirection to conceal his lie
not sure if it was just Zach's charisma, but you looked so much more natural with a guest this time magnus! keep it up
Zach saying how bouldering is like a fun version of working out is so me. I hate going to a regular gym but love climbing
For all non climbers Zack is really good. That was impressive.
Inexperienced climber: "I can't do that" but a bit of gentle coaching later "oh wow I did it" Experienced climber: "I can do that" but then spends 100 attempts finding ways not to do it!
yea Zach is so smooth for a beginner.. and has the power too!
Amazing video as always Magnus, thank you for all the great content!
Pls bring David goggins in a Video
Next challenge: make Avocado Nikicado into a climber
Magnus, where does your t-shirt come from ? I like the loose style
12:50 BRO WHAT IS THAT CEILING FAN, THEY ATTACHED HELI BLADES TO THE ROOF
the guy has definately climbed before... Joke's on Magnus LOL!
Zach is actually so nice
GO MANGNUM !!!!
Wow, he just flew through that last climb. Very impressive!
Hello, kid in blue shirt :)
magnus change the caption to 'zach king climb for the first time'  might be better for more views
Legend has it that the magdust was collected on days where Magnus himself, after days of intense climbing with no skin left, was having a rest day and the chalk that was still resting between the skin cells that remained on his fingers is what the magdust was made of. Seriously tho, the name cracked me up hahaha
What a nice guy! And Zach seems pretty nice too 😜
At one point I was expecting Zach to take off his shirt and start climbing black routes
that was mad! he also didnt at all appreciate how surprised magus was!
Magnus turning into Yoda with the "99% failure, climbing is"
Love your videos so much please do videos of you lead climbing !
LEtsss gooo MAgnus posted
As some one who’s climbed at 380 pounds over hangs are much worse
Another making video. My dream would be to have magnus train me for a day, but I'm not famous enough for that  to ever happen haha
yall just gonna ignore that he said 'looks pretty juggy' on the 5.10c 😭bros def climbed before
This guy is lying to you hes climbed before
we know magnus was embarrassed after dryfiring off a v7 😭
Oh my goodness! This is such an awesome collab! Can't wait to watch this video 🎉😍
This feels like a reverse prank on Magnus tbh.
Wow, its really impressive to climb with rope 6b in first session! Omg, its nice, Zach really catch the flow! Please keep going climbing!
The kid awkwardly waving at 7:29 was so funny
Gosh darnit he went to the gym i work at when i wasnt there 😡
It's just amazing how prepared for this Zach wasn't and even so he rocked that wall
Zach has a video from a month ago working on a climbing video he’s been working on for a year…
So sick
I've seen people in my days as an athlete that were doing well the first time but as they go through it repeatedly, they become somewhat natural in every movement and technique. Some people are just built different and they adapt very quickly. It's like their body is built for everything and can do anything with a little practice. If they put their mind to it, they suddenly become great at it.
Day 5 of asking Magnus to do a video with a Para-climber
I love your magdust chalk but its so expensive for a US consumer. If it was US disturbed it would be my exclusive go to chalk.
Put Matt King in title?
Such a great video. I love strong hold!
bring david goggins
17:08 I feel like that grade is a bit generous to that one, it seems easy consider its mostly under clings and no tricky moves. Maybe my local gym is just stingy?
15:43 Also the puzzling solving is addictive too, like "how do I approach this?" also got me hooked.
I'll be the first to say i do believe he hasnt climbed before or very little experience. He definitely looks natural but there are some things he does that definitely show he doesnt climb. Like at 18:33 where he kinda wraps his arm around the hold. Not something you do if you knew what you were doing
1:49 That's everyone's first reaction to seeing those devices haha. I watched a guy down climb like 40 feet because he couldn't trust it, it was funny to watch.
This guy knew what a climbing gym was. I don't eat that. Too good and also you can see the lie in the answer. Basics body language.
This video is gonna be a banger.
You should try do a colab with jason mamoa
I do belive him, he dident climb a v5, it saids v3-v5 the , the black one  was maybe a v4 and the one he did was v3, thats why maguns takehim to the 10c. ¡It was very impressive!
...What? The right foot flag on the first blue is someone who has climbed before.
wheres marte?
Love it when you post climbing videos Magnus <3
Stronghold is awesome
why you cut when he was explaing how he think in editing :(
meanwhile there’s me who accomplished my first v5 in one year 😭
Amazing ❤️ I've been binge watching magnus's videos now, and I'm pretty pumped to try. I'm afraid of heights as well and think my upper body strength isn't enough, but well this video left no excuse for me haha
"If you always have two feet on, you're gonna naturally bend your arms more." That is an incredible piece of advice.
I love Magnus’ videos and a great collab here; my only critique is of questionable belay technique, brake hand coming off and crossing over at 21:20. Surprised to see it.
MAKE AN ACTUAL CLIMBING VIDEO PLEASE
He's got all the ingredients to be a natural. Lean build with an analytical mind and a drive for perfection. I've noticed alot of people like that in the white collar fields progress quickly. Think it has to do with the ability to not repeat common errors and analyze what went wrong/right.
by how he flows , hes def climbed a bit before. i think hes trolling you.  ...
man casually flashed a 5.10c like it was a warmup... insane
Great video!
Dude didn't chalk up once
I was really hoping Zach would work up to v10 on day one, with a stunning reveal that he is actually a pro climber and is only posing as a beginner to blow his coach’s mind!!
i gotta get me some magdust now
@9:00 i think he is referring to route read with your hands
Would be hilarious if after Magnus has pranked multiple people into thinking he’s a noob climber, Zack turned the tables on him in this video and he’s actually like a V10/5.13 climber 😂
The video I never knew I needed, but am thankful of. Cheers!
You should organize a youtuber climbing tournament !! xD
So first, the man is a natural. Good on you Zach. But second, v3-5.... not really a v5 amiright?
Love Zach helping Magnus with the YT retention tricks, calling out the crazy video at the end.
He's really good, I think you might have created a monster here. And I have to give credit to Magnus, that is good coaching.
Fun to watch but homeboy has clearly climbed before
Love you dude. How can top level pro climbers sample this product to review it?
Cringe fake magician
Wow
natural! excellent coaching
This was such a cool collab! Zach is an absolute natural and you're a great first climbing partner.
magnus I fkn love y
yoooo magnus the best videos are when u collab with people who have never climbed before. More pleasssseee!!!
Thanks for the Yosemite grades for a change. Yeah, he's fit and a stick pole, but still...
wow I did not expect to be better at climbing than Zach King when I started climbing I started climbing v5 and v6
I hate magic, but I love Magnus, and no deception in rock climbing.
Crazy that you didn't use Zach in the title to farm more views! Lol. Awesome video as usual Magnus!
Video editing in my mind doesn't count as a magic trick. Just video editing trick. Looks cool? Sure. Magic? No.
Very impressive progress! But.. then again, with Zack, how could we trust what we see.
Please release women clothing!!
Good vid.   Would you be cool to see a video with Toby Segar of Storror. I think he’s out injured at the moment, but he’s been doing lots of crack climbing, and he could teach you some parkour things.
Gym V5 or Font V5?
The whole time I was wondering if Magnus was getting reverse pranked, and at the end there Zach was so impressive Magnus was legitimately unsure if Zach had climbed before.
1. 10c on your first day climbing wtf 2. Magnus belay technique on that last climb 🤨
I've been climbing for months and I've never even sent A v5. Climbing v5 your first session is insane.
That first “5.10c” literally looks like 5.8/9 at my gym. Those holds are so big and juggy
Who knew being tall, thin, and athletic was a recipe to be a good climber :P
@Magnus <3 ur vids go hard on him next time... and.. there is no magic..
Nicely done. Looks like he's climbed before. I've never seen a beginner hop on the wall and move like that: using tip of big toe only and not mid sole, crossing center line with feet and flagging to the outside, placing toes on holds with precision and softness, rock overs, straight arms, no frog stepping, etc. Either Magnus explained all of this stuff to him before rolling, or he's been on a climbing wall before. Because nobody's instincts are that good where they can nail techniques like that on day one that usually take 3-5 months to "click".
kewl! I watched coz of the title plus new content from Magnus  but didn't look at the thumbnail so totally didn't expect the beginner to be Zack!
Is it just me of do those 6b's really don't look like 6b (from Belgium btw)
Yo
22:00 magnus fooled others. this time he's being fooled.
15:05 look how fast he gets on the wall after saying he can't do it haha
Just when I thought it’s time for a Magnus video, he drops this banger.
See he was closer to what someone that hasn't climbed would be like, because if you didn't tell him, he probably wouldn't have known the colors were routes, and you couldn't climb on any one of them. I didn't know until I watched these videos.  I thought the colors were just for aesthetics.
Is it "Magic" if its just video editing though. Hmm 🤔 He did an awesome job climbing either way!
11:14 scary...
Mabey you can do a video with subscriber thats a beginner/intermediate climber
I'd love to see an entire video on route reading - like common patterns/arrangements, hold orientations, etc. and what moves they might indicate as well your overall process when attempting to read a problem, easy or hard.  I've been stalled on a couple problems at the top of my current skill level, but I think the next step is just KNOWING what to do so I can go in with confidence.
0:06 waiting for a US distributor.  $20 shipping for a broken rock is a bit prohibitive.  At the very least you could overthrow your government and apply for statehood, then it could ship USPS Priority Flat Rate way cheaper.
4:34 that actually makes sense
MAGNUS YOUR BACK IVE WATCHED AROUND 20 OF YOUR OLD VIDEOS WHILE YOU WHERE GONE. GOOD TO SEE YOU BACK KEEP UP THE WORK❤
This is actually so cool
Thanks to this channel I started bouldering 4 months ago, and have been in love with it ever since. I have never felt stronger in my life. It truly is an amazing sport. Recently topped my first 6b+ and currently working on a 6c+ project which I almost completed. Probably get it next session.
the colab i didn't know i needed
for the algorithm
Let’s see another video with Zach!
Been binging your vids for a minute Magnus, tremendous stuff. Your dedication is inspiring & jumps right off the screen. Highly motivational. "No time like the present" is what I'm getting from your vids. Another great one, I think it's going to be a banger.
That is the coolest exterior to a gym I've seen.
Great climbing and great video 😊
50 to 150 million views. If I got ten thousand views on one of my videos, I would not know what to do with myself.
Awesome video Magnus! Just completed my 5th boulder session in the UK and I’m obsessed! Much better than a gym 🤣 if you want some content marketing for your new business venture, I’d love to help out!! DM’d you on Instagram 😁
I got some magdust recently. I didn't expect to notice much of a difference, it's almost as big of a difference as no chalk to chalk. Very worth it
I just wanna thank you magnus, youve made me want to get off my lazy ass and finally put some work in in the gym.  I was 235, and within  In a month and a half ive lost 10 lbs so far.  I wanna thank you for giving me motivation man. Genuinely.. thank you bro...
GET MAGNUS A MILLION LIKES IN THE FIRST 24 HOURSSSSSSS
Zach seems so honest, I love that.
I have never seen a beginner climb that well. I've been climbing for a year and I wouldn't stand a chance against Zach. loved this collab!
My kids love Zach, so it was a good excuse to watch another Magnus video with them. He was damn impressive for his first session! I couldn't finish a 5.10 my first time.
This was so much fun to much
Prova att blöta fingrarna så mycket att dom blir skrynkliga!
Pretty impress for first time. Cool! Magnus your next video needs to be with Chris Sharma 🧗‍♀️
This is my gym god I wish I got to climb with you around
ONE OF US ! ONE OF US!
Saying he does magic tricks is like saying the cgi in avatar 2 is a magic trick
I love watching these videos where Magnus brings someone new into climbing.  They're really motivational.  I am a little blown away at how soft these grades are though.  That 10c looked like an 8 at my local gym, and the fact that he did it on his flash attempt of his first day of climbing in rental shoes solidifies that.  I've been climbing for years and a 10c flash is certainly not guaranteed.
This looks so fun. Monday ill finally get to try bouldering. Im quiet out of shape but got strong legs. Dont know how well ill do
Super fun. More videos with Zach!
5.10c first session. 👍 Solid.
Easyyyy
That was absolutly insane. I've never seen a beginner that good.
Magician's core strength is reverse engineering first prinicipals. Wouldnt be surprised if he watched a couple hours of magnus youtube vids to deconstruct core principals of climbing. Impressive regardless!
Just give him a couple more sessions and Zach can have a shot at doing Silence
I skydive and base and climb, also learning to fly but I get scared big time on a skydiving plane when we have to land in the plane, awful feeling!
oh hey you’re at stronghold!!
That route was not a 6B lol
How the turntables have turned... great quote! 🫡
Does anyone have recommendations on beginner climbing shoes - similar to the ones Zach is wearing in the video is great!!
good coach makes good students 😄
Shoutout to Stronghold Climbing Gym in Los Angeles, my (former) home gym!
As a mediocre climber that has been climbing for couple of years seeing his first session is like me in months, what a natural!, soo awesome!
Am I mistaken or was the belay that Magnus used banned. I think it was marked as unsafe because of possibility of not binding being too high
We'll get you the 1 Million likes in 24 hours one day Magnus :)
Nice clickbait title, what he climbed isn't even close to V5 (I didn't climb it but it's at most a 6B)... Strong climber for a first timer, about as strong as my sister it seems (very skinny and strong) and can do 6A or 6A+ ish.   V3-V5 is not 6A-6B+ it's 6A-6C  Anyways it's a good fun video but clickbaiting with grades is cringe af
Cute seeing Magnus so starstruck 🤩
I can't be the only one who doesn't know this Zach. Still gonna watch the video offcourse.
Wow What a collab! It’s amazing, really cool idea and that you do it together
Not possible but whatever, clickable guy.
I refuse to believe he hasn't climbed before. He obviously has.
greeeat vid
Zach is gifted omg
Stronghold ❤ Great to see you both there!
I can tell the dry fire pissed you off
Today is Magnus magic for Zach!
I'd love to see you in my local gym in Toulouse (France). They have boulders so hard they seem impossible to send (and some of them actually sit there undefeated even by the strongest climbers that frequent this gym). Anyway awesome video, as always !
9:07 is he talking about reading the route and using your hands to act it out?
nooo I wanted to watch more... Why do videos need to be 20 minutes =(
POGGERS New content!
such a fun video. growing up watching zach's vines and now seeing him put his foot into climbing is sick lol. thanks as always magnus for the video, ill be at your gym this thursday or friday!
Those legs though... Damn Zach...
Zach is like that one friend you take to the climbing gym that just flashes the problem you've been working on for weeks😂
This was super sus with some of his questions lol, reminds me of magnus pretending he is new. Are we sure he hasnt climbed before?
we love magnus
Magnus... you cant tell me that you dropped off that first black climb with yellow holds that easily...
Video editing is not magic. But nice climbing!
Let's get Magnus as many likes as possible in 24h!
Thank you Magnus love the Coolan videos and seeing other people rock climbing
This video was great! So good to see Magnus climbing and crushing it again. and Zack is such a natural its crazy!
Me who thought it was cool to do my first v6 in less than 10 month starting from 0, and having in my recommendations "anyone can climb up to v6" and "teaching a first time climber how to v5" 😐 i got it...
Bro change the title to "Teaching Zach King how to go from V0 to V5 in one session" it would instantly get more views
Bruh, either the rate is soft or he's climbed before. 5.10c sounds pretty brutal for a first time climber, yet alone flash it
6b first day? Either he's a lier, or this gym is super easy, or he's actually magic Now don't go calling me a hater, he might actually be almost magically naturally fit to climb, kind of like some children can be, or normally does training that makes him fit to climb  But honestly you got to admit, it seems like one of the vids magnus did pretending to be a beginner grandpa, acting like he's having a hard time but then does everything easy
wait a second. what were they talking abt in the "video editing" portion. zach does REAL magic. RIGHT?!?!?!?!?!?!
Beautiful video as always❤
he kicked ass the most in the sport wall
You can tell Zach is a natural just by seeing the way he moves from the beginning. He asks questions on how to move properly like if he should take big steps or small ones, and naturally moves with his hips. Hopefully he climbs more often!
Dude is a natural!!!!
Big blue holds... v3-v5 my ass. v2 MAX lol
This dude went to my highschool
"Wait this is way more fun than working out though". Yup that's why we do it lol
"I almost don't believe that you haven't climbed before" Magnus out here being like "Am I getting Björned right now??"
i've been waiting for a video for soo long, i was worried. Glad you are fine:)
Man has 100 million followers and I've never heard of him lol
Pretty funny how Zack was surprised that everyone going up to Magnus instead of him for once lol.
Oh my goodness, not only thank you for your videos, but somehow I've never heard of this guy. I was blown away by his videos. So wholesome, creative, and awesome! This is probably my favorite first time climber video ever. :)
I'm so happy to see this channel grow been watching for years now, finally hard work is paying off keep it up.
And he climbed all that without chalk :O
I appreciate every single Magnus collab, his videos are great, and how he mixes his content up by introducing non climbers to the sport.
I think he was asking about the route visualization that climbers do with their hands at the bottom of a climb
Bro Zach just cranked up for a first time climber, also I've seen many people trying to "coach" people but this is one of those times where your advice was so on point for every part you could tell how much it helped him even if he didn't know the terminology he still adjusted right! Great video as always Magnus!
Calling 5.10c beginner when i struggle on 5.10a was an ego killer LMAO this was an impressive video
Magnus, get these people real shoes!
Taking a famous person climbing is a pretty good format for an interview show
its a good day when magnus post.. IM SO EXCITED
Oh this is not a vid I expected this is awesome 🙏
My favorite guest so far!! A natural and such a kind person
So many followers this guy, and until now I never heard of him ...
How is that a 6B? 🤔 In my gym it would probably be a 5B… or maybe I’m just jealous of zach climbing it in his first session 😂🤷🏼‍♂️ well done!
The king
I love how he can say it is the stickiest, he knows thanks to climbing stuff
that was really awesome for a first climbing day!!!! a natural indeed!!
It’s so weird to see Magnus climbing with (long?) pants and a shirt on
I love your videos magnus ❤❤❤
Will it be a banger?
Make the thumbnail “Zack King” in yellow to pop 🎉 great title though
You already know this one is gonna be a banger! Great collab too, super fun to watch throughout the whole video!
he was doing grate!
Magnus can you train me to go from v-4 to v-9
He must be super fit to flash 6b on his first session
What gym are they at?
5.10 C on his first time?!? Huh?!?
Putting Zack in the title will definitely pull views for example beginner(Zack King)
God damn dude. Zack moves like he knows what he's doing
What the actual frick 🤯 That's seriously impressive.
YES... another video :D
A beginner.... 🤣😅🤣 Magnus is joking with a magician.  .
There is no way you can convince me that Zach has never climbed before.
My physical therapist friend climbed a v6 his first time bouldering. He had been training CrossFit for a  decade though and had the strength and grip for it already.
It would be so cool if u could collab with Pewdiepie
Exactly what I needed, thaaaanks!
Plot twist, Zack is actually Magnus in disguise
It’s been almost a year since I started climbing. Thanks to you magnus, I’ve bouldered, top roped, and lead, indoors and out. I hope I can continue to share the love of climbing like you!
My guy should really consider climbing as a hobby, V5 in the first session is pretty wild. Cool video Magnus!   Next time you're in SoCal you should come through and check out Top Out Climbing in Santa Clarita! The owner, Howie, is an awesome guy, the staff are all really cool, and the setters are talented; tons of killer dyno's, sketchy finish moves, and creative technical climbing! Top Out has a lot of community events and hosts competitions, it's a really great resource for climbers of all levels and I think it would be a killer place to shoot a video!
"Your life is in my hands😃" made me laugh
Great video but dude id love to see you send some 9a’s with Alex megos or Adam
Always great content Magnus, keep brining people to the climbing world!  and damn Zack, what a natural, crazy it was his first time!! Would be awesome to climb with you at the new parthian gym in london Magnus,  i heard Pete Whittaker came to visit a couple days ago to set a route (but i have crack-oh-phobia lol),  keen to try some Magnus style bolders.
I can confirm magdust is absolutely goated
Just don't forget to tell anyone to not grab the carabiners on the wall with their hand.
Hello Magnus, would you be able to do a video with David Goggins? No doubt he will love climbing.
This guy has climbed before
I think a reason why he is so good for a first timer is because his ape index is probably really high
Hot take...if gyms want to use colours for indicating grades, then they should use hold of that colour not tape. Otherwise they should just mark the V#
Flying gliders helped me get rid of scared of heights.
should have put zach in your title for clickbait
Yo I climb with beginners quite often and I've never seen anyone be even close to this good in the first session! It's magical really
That's a huge ceiling fan
This will be a banger
I don't need chalk. Using powder to improve grip makes zero sense to me. I wish every gym would wash it off every hold.
You don't read this shit but your a Dawg ❤
How the heck hasn’t he climbed before? Good job
The collab we never expected
Such an awesome video!!  Next video get Mr. Beast.  That would be so great.
add his name in the title!!!!
Zac is prolly hiding a rat under the hat for natural climbing im 100% sure 😂
We love u meatball

What kind of editing magic is this? He's so good!
I saw @magmidt and @zachking shooting this video at the Stronghold in LA a few months ago and my climbing buddies and I all thought something must have gone wrong at the shoot since the video never appeared. But here it is! We've been waiting!
Hes climbed before, but not much
Shoutout to the kid in the back at 7:28 lol. Hi!
I wish I could just start climbing, but I just don't like to start it alone 😅 (I don't have friends xD)
bro is a natural fr
I love how humble they both are, this is an unexpected collab but a great one 🎉
I would be a much better climber is Magnus was giving me the beta the whole time 😅😂 but really, I think this video shows the value of having a good coach. I've been able to make it to V4 and there are some V4s I still just can't figure out, not for lack of strength but technique. I've done one coaching session recently and this makes me want to do more.
Zack King, never heard of him..but I know who Magnus is. THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME!
So good to see you get Zach psyched for climbing. You're making everyone in the world into a proper climber, one YouTuber at a time!
His progression is 1 day is more than me in 6 months 😭😭 maybe time to give magic a try
He almost did what I did in 4 years in just one session😢
I would have never expected this kind of colab.. Very epic vid!
so cool to see him climb with u!
The thumbnail used to have Zach's name spelled as Zack.😉
We want to see a part 2 !
Great video magnus, I loved it like always keep up the good work❤
What if this whole video was just a magic trick? 2 legends of Youtube meet at a climbing gym = BEST CONTENT
Yesss, now I can fold my laundry. This is my favourite channel for background motivation.
You should make a video from Toby Segar from Storror
Natural
Keep it up magnus, great video
He has natural ability and also looks like he has a great physique as a beginner
ZACH AND MAG ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I clicked so fast lol
I have a really hard time believing this was his first time
This video was literally made for me. I’m someone who has been watching your vids for a while thinking about getting into Rock Climbing, and my name is literally Zack King. If that isn’t a sign to start then I don’t know what is.
Are we really surprised? Bro is a magician after all.   Ps I love that Magnus is getting to do such cool collabs. Congrats dude! You’re becoming quite the content creation legend yourself 👍
I can't believe he understood how to work off the wall on his second ever boulder, that took me two sessions to start doing
this gotta be the least expected collab ever
You're great person for the sport of rock climbing. Because you take other celebrities and lead other audiences to the sport
Hi
I love this collaboration!
STILL THE BEST COACH!!!
i don't think Zack understands how absolutely insane it is to go from V0 to V5 from a single training session. Serious props! loves these collabs and seeing more representation of Los Angeles Gyms in your videos!!
i love your climbing videos more than anything else! please never stop doing this!
Top, greetings from Germany 👍
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Damn, I was just wondering what to watch on my way home! Thank you for the upload and for introducing me to the fascinating climbing world, Magnus! Keep up the good work! ❤
Id love to see a first timer video where its just some absolutely random person who walks in for the first time and when they say its their first time they get the offer to do a session with Magnus and see what a real first time, average person, not an athlete or anything, can achieve in one session with a master.
Love your videos! How do you even get a hold of such famous people 😂
Love the video! Still confused how Magnus is able to get the most random YouTubers to climb with him 😂
I’m climbing rn
under 600 views on an almost 2m subs channel? I feel lucky!
More climbing content woo!! This is awesome
who thought zach king would just magic his way up the wall
This was a really fun video, and Zack is a natural athlete.  Really great collab Magnus.  I've really missed the content.
always a great day when magnus uploads!
wow didn't see this coming!!
Magnus is the type of guy to say "dont mind me if I do" and wiggle his fingers around donuts
Just so everyone knows. The magdust has gotten top score over the premium brands by many climbers. That stuff is worth every penny.
Hi magnus! I am training bodybuilding style and climb once a week, and would like to incorporate some light climbing training (i am a v4-5 climber). If i wanna train about 10 min a day for climbing, what would be the minimal exercises you would suggest, is hanging for finger strenght the absolute best if i can already do about 15 pull up? Thanks!
he s back
Magnus is the only person I click the notification for. An immediate watch every time.
Life is good with a magnus video !!
