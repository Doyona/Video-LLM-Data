Wow so scared that you ate that roadside pain puri 😢
lol..south Indian trying to own Kohinoor diamond, it was Maharaj Ranjit Singhs, ruler of Sikh Empire the original Panjab.
Loved the vlog mate!!
Thanks to Ben I studied what differences between Pounds" Quids"  compared to American Dollars and Booooiiiiiii if I lived in London I would have to work 5 Jobs probably
I think that was a waterfall. It is my fav Indian food
Why would anyone go off to Juhu 😂
amazing awesome!
love from india
I love how Ben always accidentally oversleeps when he's supposed to be checking out of hotels. I'm terrified to stay a minute more than I'm supposed to lol
Actually that Cake show on Netflix is so good!
Everyone was so friendly!
I'm a little late to the party but damn your lucky that's not New York or your arse would have been tossed out of that door lol.!
Why have I only found you know only to realise you were living next to my house at the start of the video
If you eat chilli. Apply salt on the burning parts of the tongue
just followed Jayesh
watching him from india , kolkata🤣🤣🤣
Man I miss India
Your queen has our diamond 😂😂😂 he wasn’t wrong but I love your response
Okay, as an Indian, a little piece of advice to any future visitors to India: You don't have to take an auto rickshaw just because you're in India😅😂 they are noisy and bumpy, just take a cab (ola or uber) and you'll have a smooth ride free of pollution. Secondly, cities aren't that walkable in India, so even though I get that a lot of tourists prefer walking to explore, it is not that great here. We have beautiful monuments and hopping between those places is much more pleasant and leaves you with a positive impression, unlike just thinking of India as a chaotic noisy place. And you can get an amazing taste of the diverse Indian cuisine at malls, shopping streets like Connaught Place (Delhi) and you can avoid street food which might not be palatable to your tastes. Have fun!
Stay safe Ben Jesus. You're gonna get kidnapped one day
Wait the Tour guide and the butler had the same name?? That’s awesome
5:29 pani puri! A really popular snack :)
imagine on the trains someone just didnt like you and pushed you off
great content man, idk why you do not get more views
Been here ... loved it ... Will go back xx🥰🥰🎩®️©️⚘🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Everybody in an Indian Hotel comes out of the woodwork for a piece of tipping action, and you fell for it lol
Oh my goodness do you ever think of just doing something different for a change? Your content is so predictable and boring
im a simple man, i see w2s i click
I appreciate you showed both sides of Mumbai. Foreigners typically tend to show the slums and call it India. Yes, what is shown exists, but there is a whole lot more out there.
Does anyone can recommend some other youtubers with videos like Ben's? I know Brett Conti and Lost Leblanc Thanks in advance!
Just looking at your India adventure it already gave me diarria
AIN'T NO WAY YOU CALLED PANI PURI A HOLLOW BALL WITH SAUCES 💀 but great video tho, I've only been watching your videos for a short while but i really enjoy your travel vlogs and challenges and hope you have a great day :)
it hurt to watch him wash the toothbrush after he put the toothpaste on
The diamond guy had me rolling.
5:30 it’s Gulguppa
I can feel the pain from eating a green chile together with the Curry. Very nice video Ben!! Love your content. Keep it up!!
You should have tried to find the English breakfast and fish n chips only by asking people where to find it, that would have been hilarious 😄 I really enjoyed watching the video!
Omg my anxiety would get the better of me in a city like Mumbai 😂😂
I don't normally comment on editing but your videos are exceptionally well done. The content is interesting but you present it in a way that makes it even more watchable. I've been in the television business for a very long time and it takes a lot to impress me.
Loved this vid! That hotel looked amazing! Can’t say the same for the English breakfast or the fish and chips🤣🤣🤣
Glad you liked it here! Come back soon🍉
Man 1 month ago I was in Mumbai what a badluck I have 🥲
10.21 first time in Mumbai, Carefull your wallet! 😅  Mumbai wouldn't go on holiday there anytime soon, it's too busy and chaotic for me 😵‍💫
the hollow ball is panipuri :)
- What £1 in the country you’re visiting buys you in a day. So for eg £1 is 100 or so rupees and what you can buy for that.  - sleep outside like the homeless in your next country (although maybe dangerous) - convince someone in your next country to buy you breakfast lunch and dinner  - a day in the life  - chill day in your next country
I live in Mumbai and this was actually amazing cause never did i thought that i would be watching ben here in my hometown hope you enjoyed it here <3
🤣green chilli!!!
Nice vid. Made my friday evening
u went to stinky armpit country, Good luck! i guess ur friend lovin it
your living my dream keep it up
2 weeks ago: found this channel   1 week ago: loving the travel inspiration   Last night: Booked tickets to Rio and Peru for next month 🫡
That guy quickly peeking into the little truck at 3:52 is hilarious
Love your video, but HAVE to ask: how much was the room at the Taj Mahal Palace? 😳😬
I feel like he had no idea of history of his hotel and the horrific terrorist attack in 2008. 31 people were shot and killed in the lobby he was chillin. Glad to see the hotel and surrounding area has recovered from it, though.
The dudes smiling that demand their diamond back have quality chat. That was hilarious
Oh no he just ate paani puri, dodgy stomach Incoming
Go to Albania
The ideas you come up with are so cool. You’re artistic videography is amazing 😍😍💕💕
Them making you the tikka masala was just the funniest moment
please Ben go to Peru
I need a magnut
the friend you made and your butler was the same name Jayesh
You need couple of 100k more views?? Include Flew to Mumbai in the title and see the results 😂💯
do a 1$ to $100 dollars in a country where you dont speak their language
Lovely video Ben! My mother is from India and I hope to visit one day as well! My brothers have gone there but these days Indian government has stopped issuing visas to Pakistanis so I haven't gone! But maybe one day. Also, you should also come to Pakistan. Tour the whole sub continent. We have a lot to offer over here. I'm sure you'll have an amazing time :)
6:20 he was legit excited when you said you’re famous
you legit make me wannna visit india looks very beautiful i know theres nasty smog and trash but gives me vibes of family there
haven't visited your channel in a while after the break in posting, but It was truly needed. Love the content
Travel to a destination and rely on help from your subscribers to get you from point A to B. Would be awesome to see you in my country NZ!
the guy asking for the kohinoor🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Amazing bro ,
Best video so far 👏
Every one is called Jayesh
Just started watching your videos and there so kool really appreciate the effort 🙌🏽🙌🏽
Must have been scary to set foot in India! Luckily it was Mumbai & not any other city lol.
Can't believe you were in Bandra Ben!
incredible video. most underrated youtuber much love🤍
12:04 umm what
"That rickshaw ride cost me 25p but I ended up paying £5" - A foreigner in India
Video challenge idea: try to not speak in an accent when speaking to non-english people.
❤️❤️❤️
The easiest way to get views, make something indian and use the sidemen.
HOW ABOUT YOU ASK MANY TINY YOUTUBER  CONTROL YOUR HOLIDAYS
I dont feel safe being in india after watching this
You should have just called me......I stay in Mumbai....and I could have been your tour guide 🫠🫠🫠
Honestly, I don't understand how he is still only at 700k subs, he deserves way more, the algorithm needs to do him a favor. Amazing content keep up the excellent work.
Travel from one end of Europe to the other only using trains boats and buses
cheers to the guy who paid for ben's sugarcane juice .
1:39 HARRY 🤣🤣🤣🤣 sweet fifa memories
Honestly I don’t ever ever bother liking videos, everytime I click on a Ben video I like it before even watching because I know it’s a banger
Awesome video :)
They said they want their Diamond back from the Queen.. LMAO
LEVY OUT
the smog in mumbai is crazy
Irish don’t  hate the English
The toilet 😅
omw to follow jayesh
Go pakistan
I prefer being in a zoo lol :) would be less stressful for sure
Never drink street drinks 🤮
Visit all 4 main islands of Japan or visit every state in America.
Ben us Irish do not hate use we actually love use
Still ridiculous how Ben hasn't hit 1 mil subs yet
Rate the edits man, they're sick. Feel like we got to see so much of mumbai
ow i just stepp'd in sht
Been watching u for a long time glad to see your keeping up with your channel just keep up the good work
How much did the trip cost ?
You're so underrated, it's unbelievable!
Super awesome video, Ben!!! 😀
Ben, wouldn't the correct spelling be "YouTubers" since it's supposed to be the plural of YouTuber? I don't see why there's an apostrophy in there.
I can’t lie, I’ve been watching your videos since you pretty much started uploading on YouTube & never really shared any comments on here but I gotta say even after all these years on YouTube you never fail to make my day, honestly love how each keeps getting better than the previous one 👌🏼Keep up the insane work ethic my dude, already counting down to your next upload!! 🚀
5:23 its called a gol gappe its delicious- 🇵🇰
"the queen has our diamond" loooooooooool🤣
Hope people there didn't rip you off mate. Cheers for the video.
Do visit Nepal too Someday🇳🇵🇳🇵
Been following you for 3 years Ben and and I'm so happy you finally came to India. Hoping you explore more of India it's a beautiful place Ben <3 maybe i catch up with you if you ever come to Delhi hahaha would love that to happen, cheers for all the efforts you put in
Fly to Brazil
Ben can you go to Lahore in Pakistan it’s like the Mumbai of Pakistan
Video idea: go to northern pakistan!
Great video!!
I'd love you to visit a few places in Ireland, maybe drive around all of Ireland's coast
Ben, how was your tummy the day after the curry??!!!
I nearly turned off when you said you don't like tea
Ben, Mumbai looks fantastic, great video mate. Shame you don't do a series on Indian foods across India.
Yo Ben, sick video! But always be careful in these big cities. Im no expert , but there are always people around that wanna rob/ or take advantage of you. (only talking from experience from watching other travelers).
I can't believe you didn't get recognised in Mumbai! Man I wish I was there during your visit.
30 days in a car travelling across the whole of England.
Ben, I think this has to be your best video in a long time, you seemed really happy to be making it too. You raised the bar again with this one.
I just recently discovered you from your last vid and I just found out you knew Harry and the rest of the Sidemen's friends 😅
I love this content, I'd love to do stuff like this myself!
The hotel at 6:55 was the victim to a terrorist attack.
Ben's videos make my day
bro im from Bangladesh  please visit our country
LOOOOOOOOOOL I am dyyying at when the guy was like the queen has our diamond the kohi noor aahah facts though!!
Go to South Africa please
You're SO sweet!!! Hands down my fav YouTuber. I love how chilled you are and polite also. Great Video!!
what is this effect named ? minute 5:00 . please, it looks wonderful
Videos are class
Go to Thailand and spend a full day in drag
Kind of cheating using your phone to find the full enlgish
most underated youtuber in the world
Great energy my dude
Really happy to see ben going to India. It maybe a bit hard to get around sometimes but India will always amaze you.
Umbria Italy
Ben you should travel to Monte Castello di Vibio PG Italy
<<< Take a Random Subscriber to a location chosen by another Random Subscriber ❤️
one of your best videos yet bro, loved it
yay new vid 🥹🥰
You just saw the India’s richest man escort Mukesh Ambani haha
Go To Africa Ben!!!
Whyd you poured water on your tooth paste 😂
I give in, I’m subscribing. With the amount of effort you put into this I have to. I will admit that a few years ago India wasn’t too high on my list for travel but with a bunch of videos I’ve watched in the last few years, it has definitely appealed to me even more.
Video Idea: Travel to the most expensive countries in each continent and try their most famous dish
Your content is 🤌🏼 Excellent video as always Ben!
Hire a personal Valet for 24hrs
You should do a Maldives 🇲🇻 video- cheapest and most expensive resorts !
Video idea: a race across Europe with other YouTubers. You have to complete various challenges along the way so that you don’t all take the same route too
Go to Russia ☠️
Mate, you should have a Balkan tour. As of now it’s still quite safe, but the situation might not be the same in a few years time. You should do it now.
The amount of times you got scammed and abused is ridiculous, just because you are white. I remember taking a mate to India with me and some bastards started to throw rocks at the car.
He actually went to India before the sidemen lmao.
the police escort you saw was probably that of India's richest man, Ambani
Absolutely loved the video Ben, glad you finally made it here.
the police escort you saw was Mukesh Ambani, Indias second richest person. owner of Reliance
So cool that you visited Mumbai! Really enjoyed this vid
Have just come back from a trip to India and it’s great to see some familiar places in Mumbai 🔥
bro went to the mechanic mid work🥲
Can u do a challenge to & in Hong Kong 🇭🇰
Go into a store, buy a random outfit and travel to the countries the items were made in!
You should’ve gone with one of your subscribers
great video like always mate
If you come to canada calgary ill be your tour guide for free 😅😅😅😁😁
🤌🏾👌
The videos great, most underrated British YouTuber easily
You definitely got the runs in India.
You should make a video surviving 24h with no money in Morroco
i love his videos! feels like i’m on facetime with a friend lol
Can't stop watching your videos, they're so good!
Video idea  Cheapest tickets to anywhere + random dares you could ask for on your insta?   Questionable idea but hey 🎢
Drink water in every country
Mumbai High Court is the best, free show in town.
Around the world in 80 days
That tuktuk driver defo had change 😂
So fun!
Absolutely love your content. You're so down to earth which makes following your content so easy and enjoyable.
Video suggestion: Go to the maldives to show us if it really is that beautifull and show us the costs.
2008 both the hotel mentioned were attacked by gunman who also used explosives.
6:30 that guy literally got hit by a van when he was crossing😭
It’s crazy how chaotic but nice India is. Thanks for this amazing video Ben!
He literally ate three British dishes while in India. Way to go on the chili
Ben i have been watching ur videos from for the last 5 years u put very hard work on each videos keep it up lovr from Saudi Arabia ❤🥰
Will give a 👍 before watching it coz I know this is 🔥
You should visit Pakistan 🇵🇰
I always like your videos before it starts because I know it’s gonna be good. (Btw I’m calling you BMX from here on)
Video idea visit, all countries in central America in a week!
Mumbai looks amazing
Should have got involved in a local cricket match
Incredible editing and storytelling.
The sausage was cooked on a radiator!!!
Love the content bro keep it up ❤
5:23 what you had is called pani puri or gol gappe, just different names used in different parts in India
Let AI chose your Holiday. (ChatGPT)
your channel deserves a lot more love than it already has!! Ben you have smashed this video <3
Thanks Ben
Ben Morris will travel to Russia, soon, making Peace with Putin..
Go on holiday with the top commenter
Going to Croatia
Everyone’s called jayesh
Authentic, real and humble. As always bro
Bro your too brave
Video idea: Take the cheapest flight to each continent!
Ffs Ben!!!! If only I knew you were here, you literally stayed like at walking distance from my house😭😭
OMG I wish I knew before hand you were coming to Mumbai 😭  Could have shown you all the amazing stuff 😐
Very cool, Ben! Love watching you on snap, too
YOU SHOULD 100 PERCENT GO TO AUSTRALIA! EVERYONE IS KIND, SO MANY DESTINATIONS TO VISIT AND BEACHES THAT COULD LAST YEARS IF YOU WENT TO EVERYONE, ALSO ANIMALS! 😃😃
Love ur vids
Ben, if you put something about India in your title it’ll hit the algorithm hard- just saying ⚡️
top quality video as always
video idea:  go up to a stranger and get them to pick at random a country to fly to, then once in the country, go up to another stranger and get them to pick at random your hotel for the night. This could be done for 3 or 4 nights
The uber malfunction at 15:28 got me laughing so hard! It reminds me of taking a taxi in Georgia where the first stop before my trip was to the gas station, I was stressed when I saw we were takin a detour but once I realized what it was about I was patiently waiting in the car.
Great video once again! You should do PAKISTAN soon! Would love to see it!
1:07 Haven't you learnt your lesson from minecraft
Great video Ben. Always love your videos
great work man
so many impressions, love it !
Mumbai looks beautiful in a very unique way, and the people seem so friendly!
Come to Pakistan 🇵🇰 proper hospitality
always hyped !
I'm sorry your telling me they don't do a Vindaloo or a Phall 🤔 I call bullshit
Siri decides where I travel
I would never go to India.
Doing the highest rated activities in Europe!
Also Bhavesh definitely earned ALOT for just taking you to the gateway
COME BACK SOON!!!!!!!!!!!!
sorry not sorry for spamming the comments
loved seeing you going through the places I go to on a daily basis and it fucking sucks that I knew you were in Mumbai but still couldn't meet you breaks my heart.  You definitely missed out the most important thing about Mumbai to eat which is vada pav like if you didn't have that your trip wasn't worth it😔✋ OBVIOUSLY YOU STAYED AT TAJ
Such a banger Ben! I've still got PTSD from mumbai trains at rush hour - pure madness!
go to vietnam
Why does no one talk about the fact that he never gets a change of clothes when he goes in these trips?
Best Youtuber ever! 🙌
Ben said he'd go to the location of the most liked comment... So for the content I nominate The volcanic island of Tristan Da Cunha, a British Overseas Territory in the South Atlantic Ocean, has the unique honor of being “the most remote point on Earth inhabited by humans.” The 38-square-mile Tristan Da Cunha is part of a five-island archipelago and is located 1,750 miles from South Africa
Why is your title grammatically incorrect?!!
next video - following a stranger around a city for 10 hours (e.g. find someone in a new city who will do what  jayesh did and to be your guide for the day)
Not the diamond. 😂
9:25 no like I'm so pissed at myself because i am here all day long  and still couldn't fucking reach out to you and meet you
LOVED ITTTT.
8:12 i would have done it for free just for you
Throw a dart at a world map and go there and explore the place
Brilliant Ben.  Fantastic challenge and well you are the best. So best wishes.
5:43 so you are telling me that you walked this path right next to my college and I fucking missed meeting you OMG
you really do put out the best content on youtube
5:31 Ben, its Pani puri
at few times it looked like you got scared a little..
4:48 ayyy first time in mumbai local and going without a ticket....well that sums up every morning i go to college
To join the EDL? What lol
No I'm from Mumbai and I currently am living here and have been watching your content since 2018/19 and the moment I realised you were here I wanted to meet you so badly😭 but ig we'll meet some other time and some other place BUT I JUST LOVEEEEEE THIS PERSPECTIVE OF MUMBAI 😭💗
Go to Indonesia!!
you should come to Estonia and make a video about exploring our country
I loved this video! Your videos are my favourite
Ben Morris content just hits different man. Can proof this since i'm here ever since the beginning (not this account). Keep it up 💪🏽
YouTuber's lol :')
I want to go here!!! ☺️🥳🔥
I'd send you to here in Malta

Challenge :  Visit pakistan and live without paying anything at all
Man had a ghol ghappa uno. If uno uno

Have a water fight with boiling water
Wonder who that escort was for??
6:47 “Your queen has our diamond!” Fucking hell 😂😂😂
NIce
5:22  It's the most famous street food of India called Pani Puri/Golgappe .
this is so entertaining and interesting I could watch your content all day 👍🏻👍🏻
Flying to whatever country your next follower is from
Video idea: Visiting a city beginning with every letter of the alphabet
FLYING TO AUSTRALIA!!! Has to be done :))
Video idea: How many countries can you go to in one day? (Logistics challenge)
When he left his tour guide in mumbi why was Big Ben in the background lol
Great vid as always Ben! love the unpretentious travel content and the vibes mint as always!
Fly to and experience a formula one race day !
great video! india seems amazing but not as amazing as Poland, you should definitely go back there! ;D
Plz film in thailand
Man it feels amazing taking a sneak peek to back home. Being born and raised in Mumbai is definitely one of the finer things in an average indian society. Shited to Cambodia, living in Phnom Penh is completely different. Missed home. Thank you for this Ben! ❤
Why the century link polo? Did you use to work for them? 😂
5:29 been waiting for this video and I’m smiling through it😂 by the way Ben that’s called Pani Puri/Gol Gappa. Originally from the neighbouring country (Pakistan) so this makes me very happy❤
drinking game, take a shot every time he says ‘my friend’
Centurylink shirt?  LOL... The worst internet service in the US.  Phone service doesn't exist anymore..
Bens most chaotic video to date 😂
THIS VIDEO CAME OUT AT THE PERFECT TIME ❤️❤️❤️❤️
5:29 that was pani puri popular south Asian snack/street food   :)
Go to the Solomon Islands! (Like so Ben will do this random request)
Go to Albania and get drunk on cheap beer with the locals 🍺
Seems like the curry came out in a hurry by the ending lol...come to N Korea next challenge
Initiation to join the EDL 🤣🤣🤣🤣
pls go to Shanghai next
Recently discovered your channel and your videos are a welcome distraction , again another great video, keep it up 👍
video idea - take the shortest flight from each destination
take a stranger to a random country (e.g pick a country out of a hat or randomizer)
We love Jay, best tour guide ever!
🔥🔥🔥
Ben is personally responsible for stealing India's diamond jewels (and the Queen too)😩
My questione is , do you always travel alone? Isnt it bit Boring?
Cool video, as always
Bay Islands in Honduras, cheepest diving on earth on the second biggest coral reef on earth
What a vid
Mate I'm heading to Mumbai tomorrow - the Taj Hotel looks unbelievable!!
Idea: Ben recreates film scenes - eg: Feed the birds outside St Pauls Cathedral (Mary Poppins).
video was amazing, travel to fairy meadows in pakistan via the most dangerous road in the world
Explore Europe in 7 days by train.
Idea: Ben visits every London Underground Station.
Idea: Ben comes to dig my allotment for the day! ;-)
Man tht ost , why some traditional Indian intrument randomly playing in background, tht tung tung sound
Love how you embrace any challenge and make it fun!  Really interesting insight into Mumbai.  Brilliant!
9:35 that is the convoy of Mukesh Ambani, India's 2nd richest person
What a video! The randomness of different cultures. I should imagine the lady screaming at you will be to do with colonialism. The video was fantastic - I loved it
I just Can’t believe You were In INDIA ! Been following You since your first video ! Hope you enjoyed the chaos ♥️ You are the most underrated Vlogger I have seen till date 💯 Kudos buddy
Around the world in 7 days / 7 continents in 7 days including Antarctica
Go visit pagan holy sites
great video Ben
As an Indian, I was pleasantly surprised by my first visit to Mumbai. The change of architecture was very interesting to me.
Another top vid! U should travel eastern europe way next would be great content
tikka masala is definitely not the spiciest curry😭😭😭
DO ANOTHER TAKING THE CHEAPEST FLIGHT EVERYDAY PLEASE
How quick can you get around the world visiting at least 5 countries?
Shame you asked your bro friends and they set such uninteresting, childish tasks Ben, you must have been as disappointed as the viewers.
Frequent uploads 😍🔥
i like this kind of videos and the idea is pretty origenal
Ben Morris gonna be the Youtube creator of the year 2023

Hi
